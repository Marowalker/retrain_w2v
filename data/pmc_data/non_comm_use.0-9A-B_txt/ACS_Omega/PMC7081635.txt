A previously
developed and industrially feasible process for selective,
Pd-mediated, liquid-phase heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of
nitriles to primary amines was extended to the reduction of 3-phenylpropionitrile
(PPN) to 3-phenylpropylamine (PPA). PPN, which belongs to the homologous
series of benzonitrile (BN) and benzyl cyanide (BC), was hydrogenated
under mild reaction conditions (30–80 °C, 6 bar), over
Pd/C, in two immiscible solvents (dichloromethane/water) and using
acidic additives (NaH2PO4 and H2SO4). Although relatively high conversion (76%) was achieved,
the selectivity to PPA (26%) and its isolated yield (20%) were lesser
than those in the case of the hydrogenation of BN or BC reported earlier.
However, the purity of PPA was >99% without using any purification
method. Quantum chemical calculations using a density functional theory
(DFT) method were performed to compare the adsorption interactions
of the different imine intermediates on palladium, as well as to clarify
the differences observed in the primary amine selectivity. PPA is
a valuable intermediate for the synthesis of carboxypeptidase B enzyme
inhibitors, antimuscarinic drugs, or potential anticancer agents in
the pharmaceutical industry.

==== Body
Introduction
Our method1 developed previously allows
the efficient, industrially feasible, and selective, Pd-catalyzed
heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of nitriles to the corresponding
primary amines in liquid phase. Full conversion, very high isolated
yield (90%), and excellent selectivity (95%) can be achieved using
this process. The reduction of benzonitrile (BN) to benzylamine (BA)
was carried out over palladium on different supports, in two immiscible
solvents (dichloromethane/water), applying a medium acidic additive
(NaH2PO4), under mild conditions (30 °C,
6 bar), and a very pure product (>99%) was obtained without any
purifying
procedures.1 Later, this method was also
applied in the hydrogenation of benzyl cyanide (BC) to 2-phenylethylamine
(PEA), but the complete conversion of BC was accompanied by lower
primary amine selectivity (45%) and isolated yield (40%).2

In this study, by adapting the aforementioned
reduction process
modified slightly, the liquid-phase catalytic hydrogenation of 3-phenylpropionitrile
(PPN), which belongs to the homologous series of BN and BC, to 3-phenylpropylamine
(PPA) was examined in detail. PPA is a valued product for using as
a template molecule in the synthesis of vanadium oxide nanotubes3,4 or ion exchangers,5 as well as in that
of Hofmann-type complexes containing cyanometallate groups.6 However, it plays the most significant role in
the pharmaceutical industry because it can be applied to produce carboxypeptidase
B (CpB) enzyme inhibitors,7 antimuscarinic
drugs,8 or potential anticancer agents.9

Some recent reviews have provided overviews
of the new developments
in transition metal-catalyzed heterogeneous or homogeneous catalytic
hydrogenation of nitriles.10−14 In addition, the general reduction methods of nitriles to primary
amines were previously reported in detail.1,2 Recently,
however, some very interesting multicomponent nanocatalyst systems
have been fabricated for the transfer hydrogenation of nitrile compounds.15−17 These magnetite nanosphere-supported alloy catalysts contained mainly
copper15−17 or iron,15 while precious
metals (Pd15,16 or Rh17) were present only at a ppm level. Thus, for example, various nitriles
were completely converted to primary amines with high selectivities
(85–97%) over a Pd–Cu catalyst in the absence of iron,
but secondary amines were obtained with good and excellent selectivities
(76–98%) in the presence of Fe.15 Moreover, the catalyst could readily be separated by an external
magnetic field and reused (5×) without significant activity loss.

Henceforth, we focus on the hydrogenation of PPN or its α,β-unsaturated
derivative, cinnamonitrile (CN). Both heterogenous catalysts, such
as nickel,18−23 cobalt,20,22,24 copper,22 ruthenium,22 or palladium,25,26 and homogeneous ones, such as Ir(I),27 Ru(II),28,29 Fe(II),30−32 Co(III),33,34 Mn(I),35,36 or Rh(I)37 complexes,
were used in these reductions. Thus, CN was converted to cinnamylamine
(CA) over Raney-type catalysts (Ni or Co), in methanol containing
14% NH3, at 100 °C and 80 bar with 60–80% selectivity
and almost complete conversion (90–99%).20 Similarly, cinnamonitrile was hydrogenated to CA with 74%
selectivity and complete conversion, over a highly dispersed 11% copper
on silica catalyst, in toluene, at 130 °C and 40 bar, while over
a 1.8% Ru/SiO2 catalyst, only 8% conversion of CN and 40%
selectivity to CA were achieved also in toluene, at 100 °C and
13 bar.22 Using a 5% palladium on carbon
catalyst at 60 °C and 4 bar, in methanol, the hydrogenation of
PPN and CN, respectively, was also investigated.25 It was found that the reduction of CN resulted in exclusively
PPN, that is, the saturation of C=C double bond took place
fast and selectively, while no PPA was detected. When PPN was hydrogenated
under the same conditions, no formation of PPA was also observed.
Similar results were reported by Arai and co-workers when a two-phase
medium (toluene and water) and supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2, p = 10 bar) were used in the Pd-catalyzed
hydrogenation of PPN and CN, respectively.26 With 5% palladium on alumina, only PPN was formed in the reduction
of cinnamonitrile after 30 min, at 50 °C and 40 bar, while that
of PPN resulted in PPA with 82% selectivity, after 60 min, but only
in the presence of sCO2 and at a relatively low conversion
(32%). These methods, however, have some disadvantages: using a large
excess of ammonia, applying special reaction conditions, and no or
low conversion of PPN achieved by palladium.

In this work, the
influences of temperature, the acidic additives,
reaction time, solvents, and the amount of the catalyst on the isolated
yield and the selectivity to PPA, as well as on the conversion of
PPN are discussed. Furthermore, a comparison of the observed differences
in the selectivity in the hydrogenation of nitriles investigated previously
and currently (BN, BC, PPN) was also made by quantum chemical calculations.
The density functional theory (DFT) method was used for modeling the
adsorption interactions between imine-type intermediates (benzaldimine,
2-phenylethylimine, 3-phenylpropylimine) and the palladium catalyst.

Results
and Discussion
Reaction Pathways
Scheme 1 shows the probable reaction
pathways (intermediates,
products) in the hydrogenation of PPN. As seen, the formation of the
primary amine (PPA) takes place through the 3-phenylpropylimine (PPI)
intermediate, but a secondary amine, bis(3-phenylpropyl)amine (BPPA),
could also be formed in a condensation reaction of PPN and PPI, accompanied
by the elimination of NH3. Further addition of PPI to BPPA
followed by hydrogenation could provide a tertiary amine, tris(3-phenylpropyl)amine
(TPPA). Whereas, other side reactions could arise because PPI could
react with water to form 3-phenylpropanal (PPAL), which could also
undergo hydrogenation to give 3-phenyl-1-propanol (PPOH).

Reaction Pathways in the Hydrogenation of PPN over Palladium
Influence of Acidic Additives and Temperature
At first,
similarly to our previous works,1,2 sodium dihydrogen phosphate
(NaH2PO4) was used as an acidic additive in
the hydrogenation of PPN. Its function is to form a salt with PPA
and to hold that in the aqueous phase, decreasing the chance of byproduct
formation.

As seen in Table 1, the use of 2.0 equimolar NaH2PO4 resulted in low conversion of PPN and selectivity to PPA (24 and
27%, respectively) in a dichloromethane/water solvent mixture, over
10% Pd/C (Selcat Q) catalyst (0.3 g·g–1 catalyst/substrate
ratio), at 30 °C and 6 bar, after 7 h. Furthermore, the isolated
yield of the product (7%) and its PPA-content (88.2%) were also much
lower than those values obtained in the hydrogenation of benzonitrile1 or benzyl cyanide.2 To improve the conversion of PPN, the reaction temperature was increased
to 50 and 80 °C, respectively (Table 1). As expected, higher conversions (36 and
53%) were achieved at these higher temperatures, but the selectivity
to PPA decreased to 21–22%, and the purity of the product remained
the same (88.8–90.0% PPA-content). On the basis of the gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) measurements,
these low primary amine selectivities were due to the formation of
the tertiary amine byproduct (TPPA) in a higher amount (14.8–45.0%),
as shown in Table 2. Interestingly, no production of secondary amine (BPPA) was observed
at any temperatures applied. Presumably, the more aliphatic PPI can
easily react with BPPA to produce TPPA as well.

These results suggest that NaH2PO4 with moderate
acidity (pH = 3.5) was not able to form a stable salt with PPA, resulting
in moderate conversion and low primary amine selectivity. Since PPA
is a stronger organic base (pKb = 3.95)
than 2-phenylethylamine (pKb = 4.16) or
benzylamine (pKb = 4.57) obtained previously
by applying this process,1,2 the reduction of PPN
was also examined under more acidic conditions (pH < 2). Typically,
mineral acids (e.g., hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and ortho-phosphoric acid) can be the obvious choice for this
purpose. Based on our previous experience in the hydrogenation of
benzyl cyanide,2 where the use of HCl or
H3PO4 proved to be less successful, H2SO4 was chosen as another acidic additive.

Accordingly,
the half amount of sodium dihydrogen phosphate was
replaced with sulfuric acid and the effects of these acidic additives
on the conversion of PPN and the selectivity to PPA, under the same
conditions (10% Pd/C (Selcat Q), dichloromethane/water, 30–80
°C, 6 bar), are also summarized in Table 1. As seen, the presence of 1.0 equimolar
H2SO4 in addition to 1.0 equimolar NaH2PO4 resulted in better conversion (46%), isolated yield
(22%), and primary amine selectivity (48%) at 30 °C compared
to those values achieved with NaH2PO4 itself.
Moreover, the product purity was also improved (>99% PPA-content).
When the temperature was raised to 50 or 80 °C, the conversion
of PPN was also increased (61 and 76%, respectively), but this was
accompanied by diminishing the selectivity to PPA (35 and 26%), similarly
to the use of NaH2PO4 itself. The observed low
primary amine selectivities were also due to the formation of TPPA
in a much higher amount (20.1–66.5%), and still no BPPA was
detected (Table 2).
However, the isolated yields (20–22%) and the PPA-content of
the product (>99%) remained to be practically the same values.
Further
increase of the amount of H2SO4 and NaH2PO4 (2.0 equimolar separately) had no significant
effect in the course of the hydrogenation of PPN, because the conversion
(75%) and the selectivity to PPA remained unchanged (26%). Besides,
the composition of the byproduct was also practically the same as
found in the presence of a lesser amount of the acidic additives applied
(Table 2). Thus, it
is unnecessary to use them in a high proportion because this resulted
in no further improvements, neither in the conversion nor in the primary
amine selectivity.

According to our results, the combined application
of these two
acidic additives (H2SO4 and NaH2PO4) is a key parameter in terms of the conversion of PPN and
the selectivity to PPA. Although the highest primary amine selectivity
(48%) and isolated yield (22%) are obtained at 30 °C, the conversion
(46%) is moderate. To achieve a relatively high conversion of PPN
(76%), this hydrogenation has to be carried out at 80 °C, at
most, but the selectivity to PPA is low (26%) due to the high amount
of TPPA formed almost exclusively.

Effect of Reaction Time
Since the conversion of PPN
was not complete after 7 h, even at 80 °C, the influence of reaction
time on the primary amine selectivity, the conversion, and the isolated
yield in this hydrogenation over 10% Pd/C (Selcat Q), in dichloromethane/water,
in the presence of 1.0 equimolar NaH2PO4 and
1.0 equimolar H2SO4, at 80 °C and 6 bar
is shown in Figure 1 and Table 3.

5.27 g NaH2PO4·H2O (38.2 mmol)
and 3.82 g conc. H2SO4 (38.2 mmol), 80 °C,
6 bar.

As seen, moderate
conversion (41%) and selectivity to PPA (38%)
were achieved after a relatively short reaction time (3.5 h), and
a very pure product (99.5% PPA-content) was isolated in 16% yield.
When the reaction time was increased to 7 h, the conversion of PPN
(76%) and the isolated yield of PPA (20%) also became higher, but
the selectivity to PPA significantly decreased to 26%. A further increase
of the reaction time to 14 or 21 h resulted in higher conversions
(81 and 86%, respectively) and a slight decrease in the selectivity
values (23%), while the isolated yields remained unchanged (19–20%).

Although a very pure product (>99% PPA-content) was obtained
in
each hydrogenation of PPN with different reaction times, it was also
observed that the poor selectivity to PPA after 14 or 21 h was due
to a higher ratio of byproducts (Table 3), that is, the amount of tertiary amine (TPPA) was
significantly increased (25.5 → 80.4%). The reaction profile
for the hydrogenation of PPN (Figure 2) also shows that no formation of secondary amine (BPPA)
was observed, at all, even after 21 h. The ratio of miscellaneous
byproducts (PPAL and/or PPOH) was minimal (0.8–1.1 and 0–1.6%,
respectively) and remained practically the same irrespectively of
the reaction time. These results indicate that there are more opportunities
for side reactions to take place, as shown in Scheme 1, after longer reaction times, presumably
due to a weaker adsorption of the imine intermediate (PPI) on palladium.
To confirm our hypothesis, quantum chemical calculations (DFT) were
performed to model and compare the adsorption interactions between
imines (benzaldimine, 2-phenylethylimine, PPI) and palladium, which
will be discussed later.

Figure 2 Reaction profile for the hydrogenation of PPN
over palladium. Conditions:
5.0 g (38.2 mmol) PPN, 1.5 g 10% Pd/C (Selcat Q) catalyst, 250 mL
water and 50 mL dichloromethane, 5.27 g NaH2PO4·H2O (38.2 mmol) and 3.82 g conc. H2SO4 (38.2 mmol), 80 °C, 6 bar.

On the basis of our results, it can be concluded that it is expedient
to carry out this hydrogenation within 7 h to obtain a relatively
high conversion value (76%), a reasonable isolated yield (20%) and
primary amine selectivity (26%), namely, the further increase of the
reaction time (up to 21 h) results in mainly the formation of TPPA
and a slight improvement in the conversion of PPN.

Influence of
Organic Solvents
As well-known,38 significant differences in the selectivity and
the activity of the catalysts used in hydrogenation reactions can
occur due to considerable solvent effects.

The results of the
hydrogenation of PPN in the mixtures of water and different organic
solvents, over 10% Pd/C (Selcat Q), using 1.0 equimolar NaH2PO4 and 1.0 equimolar H2SO4, at
80 °C and 6 bar, after 7 h are given in Table 4.

(38.2 mmol) and 3.82 g conc. H2SO4 (38.2 mmol),
80 °C, 6 bar, reaction time: 7 h.

As seen, a dichloromethane/water solvent mixture provided
the best
isolated yield (20%) selectivity (26%) and product purity (99.3% PPA-content)
at a relatively high conversion value (76%). When a hexane/water solvent
mixture was applied, the conversion (52%), the isolated yield (1%),
the selectivity (2%), and the purity of the product (87.5% PPA-content)
decreased drastically. The main reason for these low values was the
fact that the starting nitrile cannot be dissolved in hexane, and
the catalyst was conglomerated by the substrate and it seceded onto
the inner body of the autoclave. There was no solubility problem in
toluene; however, both the conversion of PPN (56%) and the selectivity
to PPA (7%) and the isolated yield (5%) and the purity of the product
(88.3% PPA-content) became appreciably lower than those in the water/dichloromethane
system. Applying tert-butyl methyl ether, a relatively
high conversion value (78%) was obtained, but the other results (8%
selectivity, 7% isolated yield, 84.7% PPA-content) were very similar
to those achieved with toluene. In an ethyl acetate/water mixture,
the hydrogenation of PPN was also fast, similarly to dichloromethane
or tert-butyl methyl ether (Figure 3), and a slight increase in the conversion
(76%), the selectivity (11%), the isolated yield (9%), and the purity
of the product (95.9% PPA-content) was observed compared to toluene
or tert-butyl methyl ether.

3.82 g conc. H2SO4 (38.2 mmol), 80 °C,
6 bar.

As seen in Table 5, the use of different organic solvents instead
of dichloromethane
significantly altered the ratio of byproducts, resulting in very low
selectivity to PPA. In all cases, similar to the hydrogenations carried
out in the presence of dichloromethane, no formation of BPPA was observed,
but in hexane or toluene, the amount of TPPA was appreciably lower
(28.0 and 38.2%, respectively) than those detected in tert-butyl methyl ether, ethyl acetate, or dichloromethane (69.3, 68.6
or 66.5%). The lower tertiary amine contents were due to 3-phenylpropanal
(PPAL) and 3-phenyl-1-propanol (PPOH) formed in higher ratios (7.5–18.5
and 1.9–4.7%, respectively).

(38.2 mmol) and 3.82 g conc. H2SO4 (38.2 mmol),
80 °C, 6 bar, reaction time: 7 h.

A significant amount of PPOH (8.6%) was also measured
in ethyl
acetate. Presumably, the different organic solvents significantly
affected the adsorption strength of the imine type intermediate on
palladium.

Accordingly, it is preferred to use a water-immiscible
organic
solvent as an accompanying solvent pair of water during this hydrogenation.
Altogether, dichloromethane gave the best results related to conversion,
selectivity, isolated yield, and purity among the solvents tested.

Influence of the Amount of the Catalyst
The effect
of different amounts of 10% Pd/C (Selcat Q) catalyst on the selectivity
to PPA, as well as on the conversion of PPN and the isolated yield
in dichloromethane/water, using 1.0 equimolar NaH2PO4 and 1.0 equimolar H2SO4, at 80 °C
and 6 bar is summarized in Table 6.

and 3.82 g conc. H2SO4 (38.2 mmol), 80 °C,
6 bar, reaction time: 7 h.

As seen, the decrease of the catalyst/substrate ratio from 0.30
to 0.10 g·g–1 gradually by 0.05 g·g–1 was accompanied by diminishing the isolated yield
(20 → 11%) and selectivity to PPA (26 → 21%) after a
reaction time of 7 h. In addition, the conversion of PPN also became
significantly lower (74 → 51%) by decreasing the amount of
palladium on carbon. In all cases, however, the purity of the product
was also very high (>99% PPA-content). Since the highest selectivity
(25–26%) and isolated yield (19–20%) were obtained at
0.25–0.30 g·g–1 catalyst/substrate ratios,
it is favorable to use these amounts of the catalyst for this hydrogenation.

As also noticeable in Table 6, the initial rates (v0) continuously
increased from 3.19 to 6.59 nL H2 gPd–1 h–1 by decreasing the amount of 10% Pd/C (0.30
→ 0.10 g·g–1). Obviously, in the case
of kinetically controlled reaction, v0 (expressed as g–1 of Pd), should not change unless
the reaction conditions are altered. Nevertheless, it was observed
that the consistence of the reaction mixture had varied above 55 °C
(Figure 4) at all catalyst/substrate
ratios applied; namely, the normal suspension of the Pd/C catalyst
(Figure 4a) had turned
to a more viscous one (Figure 4b, red marker), resulting in a less effective stirring and
difficulties in the contact of the different phases. Due to this alteration,
at higher temperature (>55 °C), the mass transport became
the
dominant step in this hydrogenation.

Figure 4 Consistence of the slurry reaction mixture
at 30 °C (a) and
above 55 °C (b) in the hydrogenation of PPN over palladium on
carbon. Conditions: 5.0 g (38.2 mmol) PPN, 10% Pd/C (Selcat Q) catalyst,
250 mL water and 50 mL dichloromethane, 5.27 g NaH2PO4·H2O (38.2 mmol) and 3.82 g conc. H2SO4 (38.2 mmol), 6 bar, reaction time: 7 h.

Furthermore, it was found that there was no appreciable difference
in the composition of byproducts by changing the amount of catalyst
(Table 7). As seen,
the ratio of the unreacted PPN increased from 31.1 to 55.5% by decreasing
the catalyst/substrate ratio, but the main byproduct also remained
to be TPPA (66.5–40.8%) accompanied by the minimal formation
of PPAL (0.5–0.8%) or PPOH (0.9–3.7%). Similarly to
the previous results, no secondary amine (BPPA) was detected as well.
Accordingly, the different amounts of palladium on carbon had no effect
on the ratio of the byproducts; namely, tertiary amine (TPPA) was
almost solely formed.

and 3.82 g conc. H2SO4 (38.2 mmol), 80 °C,

Although the applied catalyst/substrate ratios (0.10–0.30
g·g–1) are comparatively high with referring
to those (0.01–0.10 g·g–1) commonly
used in the industry,39 the 10% Pd/C catalyst
is economically viable on an industrial scale, taking into account
the high price of PPA.

Recycling the Used Catalyst or the Unreacted
Starting Material
Reuse of the Pd/C Catalyst
The influence
of the used
10% Pd/C (Selcat Q) on the primary amine selectivity, the conversion
of PPN, and the isolated yield of PPA, in dichloromethane/water, in
the presence of 1.0 equimolar NaH2PO4 and 1.0
equimolar H2SO4, at 80 °C and 6 bar, after
7 h is shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Effect of the reused (a), as well as the prehydrogenated and reused
(b) 10% Pd/C catalysts on conversion, isolated yield, and selectivity
in the hydrogenation of PPN. Conditions: 5.0 g (38.2 mmol) PPN, 1.5
g 10% Pd/C (Selcat Q) catalyst, 250 mL water and 50 mL dichloromethane,
5.27 g NaH2PO4·H2O (38.2 mmol)
and 3.82 g conc. H2SO4 (38.2 mmol), 80 °C,
6 bar, reaction time: 7 h.

As seen, the reused catalyst provided much worse results; namely,
the conversion, the selectivity, and the isolated yield were significantly
deteriorated (76 → 38, 26 → 12, and 21 → 7%,
respectively) already in the second reaction (Figure 5a). This clearly indicates that the catalyst
was partly deactivated during the second run, presumably due to the
poisoning of the catalytically active centers or an intense effect
of the strong mineral acid (H2SO4) on the highly
dispersed Pd particles. The latter was evidenced by measuring the
palladium content of the reused catalyst using an X-ray fluorescent
(XRF) spectroscopy method; namely, the original value (10.0% Pd of
the fresh catalyst) decreased to 8.7%. No Pd contamination, however,
was detected in the final product (PPA) due to our very efficient
work-up procedure,1,2 but its purity appreciably diminished
from 99.0 to 69.6% (Table 8). The impurity was the starting material (PPN) due to its
low conversion (38%). The byproduct, in addition to PPN (66.0%), contained
mainly TPPA (26.3%) and a low amount of PPAL and PPOH (7.6 and 0.1%,
respectively), that is, the components of the side product were the
same as observed in the first reaction.

1.5 g 10% Pd/C (Selcat Q) catalyst, 250 mL of water and 50 mL dichloromethane,
5.27 g NaH2PO4·H2O (38.2 mmol),
and 3.82 g conc. H2SO4 (38.2 mmol), 80 °C,
6 bar, reaction time: 7 h.

b 10% Pd/C catalyst was prehydrogenated
in 200 mL water, at 30 °C and 6 bar, for 0.5 h.

To avoid Pd leaching, the catalyst
was prehydrogenated (30 °C,
6 bar, 0.5 h) prior to the reaction, as well as before its reuse.
As a result of this pretreatment, the Pd content of the catalyst also
remained to be 10.0% even after the second run. As seen in Figure 5b, using the prehydrogenated
Pd/C catalyst resulted in a slightly higher isolated yield (23%) and
primary amine selectivity (30%) than those values obtained in the
original reduction of PPN in the first run (Figure 5a). Furthermore, very similar conversion
(73%), isolated yield (19%), and selectivity to PPA (27%) were achieved
with the prehydrogenated Pd/C catalyst in the second run. These results
indicate that the hydrogen-rich palladium is resistant to the strong
acidic conditions.

In addition, the purity of the product (99.8
and 99.7%, respectively)
and the composition of the side products were practically the same
in each run using prehydrogenated palladium on carbon (Table 8). The side products contained
mainly TPPA (64.6 and 65.8%. respectively), the unreacted PPN (33.5
and 32.5%, respectively), as well as a low amount of PPAL and PPOH
(1.3–1.2 and 0.6–0.5%, respectively), that is, the ratios
of the components in the side products were the same in these two
reactions.

Accordingly, it is not expedient to reuse the 10%
Pd/C spent catalyst
in this hydrogenation because it showed lower activity and provided
weaker conversion and primary amine selectivity already in the second
catalytic run, whereas its application in a prehydrogenated form resulted
in practically the same results after each reaction.

Recycling
the Unreacted PPN
As it is mentioned above,
the hydrogenation of PPN over 10% Pd/C (Selcat Q), in dichloromethane/water,
using 1.0 equimolar NaH2PO4 and 1.0 equimolar
H2SO4, at 30 °C and 6 bar, after 7 h resulted
in a moderate selectivity to PPA (48%) and conversion of PPN (46%),
but a relatively high ratio of PPN (73.0%) remained untouched (Table 2). Therefore, the
reduction of PPN with recycling the unreacted starting material was
also examined, and its result is depicted in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Recycling the unreacted starting material and
its influence on
conversion, isolated yield, and selectivity in the hydrogenation of
PPN. Conditions: (a) 5.0 g (38.2 mmol) PPN, 1.5 g 10% Pd/C (Selcat
Q) catalyst, 250 mL water and 50 mL dichloromethane, 5.27 g NaH2PO4·H2O (38.2 mmol) and 3.82 g
conc. H2SO4 (38.2 mmol), 30 °C, 6 bar,
reaction time: 7 h; (b) 2.70 g (20.6 mmol) unreacted and 2.30 g (17.6
mmol) fresh PPN.

It was found that recycling
the unreacted PPN could readily be
realized; moreover, a moderate increase was achieved in the combined
conversion (46 → 51%), selectivity (48 → 51%), and isolated
yield (22 → 26%) values. Furthermore, as seen in Table 9, the purity of the product
(99.8% PPA-content) and the composition of the byproduct were the
same in both hydrogenations. Only the formation of TTPA (19.8–18.1%)
and PPAL (7.2–8.2%) was also observed practically in unaltered
proportions.

b 2.70 g (20.6 mmol) unreacted and
2.30 g (17.6 mmol) fresh PPN.

Based on these results, reusing the residual starting material
could be an advantageous method from a technological aspect and could
improve the efficiency of this hydrogenation process.

Theoretical
Considerations
It was demonstrated in our
previous work2 that there were no appreciable
differences in the calculated energy profiles of the byproduct formation;
thus, other interactions (e.g. diverse adsorption of the imine intermediate)
could affect the primary amine selectivity during these reductions.
Therefore, the adsorption of the imines, such as PPI, 2-phenylethylimine
(PEI), and benzaldimine (BI), on the palladium catalyst was modeled
by quantum chemical calculations (DFT method) to enable the explanation
of the dissimilarities in the observed primary amine selectivity during
the palladium-catalyzed hydrogenation of BN, BC, and PPN, respectively.

As shown in Figure 7, the computed most stable conformer of PPI, PEI, or BI was placed
on an Pd48 cluster with a (111) surface, according to the energetically
favored adsorption mode of benzene (the aromatic ring parallel to
the surface) on Pd(111).40 To compare these
interactions, the energy of adsorption (ΔEads) of these compounds on palladium was also calculated (Table 10).

Figure 7 Computed adsorption modes
of conformers with minimal energy of
PPI (a), PEI (b), and BI (c) intermediates on a Pd48 three-layer slab
with a (111) surface.

a Calculated by

As seen
in Figure 7c, the benzene
ring and the imino group in the BI molecule are in
the same plane, so they are simultaneously adsorbed on the catalyst
surface. Accordingly, a stronger interrelationship forms between BI
and Pd (ΔEads = −120.50 kJ
mol–1), and this intermediate can remain on the
catalyst surface for a longer period of time; therefore, there is
a minimal chance of byproduct formation. On the contrary, the imino
group is above the plane of the phenyl ring in the PEI or PPI molecule
(Figure 7a,b), so these
compounds can adsorb via their aromatic moiety only on palladium,
resulting in weaker adsorption energies (ΔEads = −95.41 and −87.38 kJ mol–1, respectively). Thus, their imino segment can react more easily
with another 2-phenylethylamine or PPA molecule to give secondary
or tertiary amines in a higher amount. In addition, these intermediates
can desorb easier from the surface of the catalyst, and they can react
with the primary amines in the reaction mixture as well.

According
to the results of these high-level DFT calculations,
it can be stated that the observed low primary amine selectivity in
the hydrogenation of PPN was due to weaker adsorption interaction
between the imine intermediate (PPI) and palladium.

Conclusions
PPN was reduced to PPA over palladium on carbon, under mild reaction
conditions (30–80 °C, 6 bar), in liquid phase by extending
our selective, heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation method for the
conversion of nitriles to primary amines developed previously.1 PPN belongs to the homologous series of benzonitrile
(BN) and benzyl cyanide (BC) whose hydrogenations were reported earlier.1,2 Despite the systematic variation of the reaction parameters, low
primary amine selectivity (26%) and isolated yield (20%), at a relatively
high conversion (76%), were achieved contrary to the results of the
hydrogenation of BN or BC. The purity of the product, however, was
over 99% without using any special purifying procedures. Although
the unreacted starting material (PPN) could be recycled without any
problems, the reused 10% Pd/C catalyst showed low activity and provided
weaker conversion and primary amine selectivity values, respectively,
whereas the prehydrogenation of the catalyst prior to its reusing
improved its application in this hydrogenation.

In order to
clarify the reasons of the differences in the primary
amine selectivities, quantum chemical calculations using the DFT method
were performed. The molecular modeling computations revealed that
the diverse adsorption abilities of the imines could influence the
selectivity of these hydrogenations. The calculated adsorption energies
(ΔEads) of these intermediates on
Pd(111) showed that their adsorption strength decreases in the following
order  

Due to these differences and the dissimilar structures of
their
conformers with minimal energy as well, the possibility of byproduct
formation both on the surface of the catalyst and in the reaction
mixture was increased with decreasing the adsorption strength of these
imines, that is, there is a much higher chance for side reactions
in the case of PPI.

Additional examinations to broaden this
selective hydrogenation
process to the reduction of other nitriles to primary amines are also
proceeding.

Experimental Section
Materials
The 10% palladium on carbon
catalyst (Selcat
Q)41 was supplied by Szilor Ltd. (Budapest,
Hungary). PPN was prepared from cinnamonitrile (98%) received from
Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) by catalytic hydrogenation over 10% Pd/C,
at 25 °C and 1 bar, in situ. Dichloromethane (p.a.), toluene
(p.a.), ethyl acetate (p.a.), hexane (p.a.), tert-butyl methyl ether (p.a.), H2SO4 (98%), and
NaH2PO4·H2O (p.a.) were purchased
from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).

Hydrogenation Reactions
The hydrogenation reactions
were performed in a 0.5 dm3 BEP 280 (Büchi) glass
autoclave (Büchi AG, Uster, Switzerland) equipped with a magnetically
driven turbine stirrer (speed: 1800 rpm) and an automatic gas flow
controlling and measuring unit (Büchi bpc 6010) at 6 bar and
30–80 °C. The initial rate values (v0) were calculated from the conversion curves.

The product
(>99% PPA-content) was isolated with 20–23% yields in the
same
way as described in our previous works.1,2 The spectroscopic
data of PPA are the following: 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz): δ ppm 1.56 (br s, 2H, NH2), 1.77 (dt, J = 14.5 and 7.2 Hz, 2H, CH2CH2CH2), 2.65 (t, J = 7.5 Hz,
2H, CH2Ph), 2.72 (t, J = 6.9 Hz, 2H, CH2NH2), 7.17–7.30
(m, 5H, Ar–H); 13C NMR (CDCl3, 75 MHz):
δ ppm 33.39 (CH2CH2CH2), 35.43 (CH2Ph), 41.85 (CH2NH2), 125.91 (Ar–CH), 128.48 (2 × Ar–CH),
128.50 (2 × Ar–CH), 142.24 (Ar–C); MS m/z (rel %) 135 (3), 118 (100), 103 (7), 91 (30),
77 (9), 65 (8), 51 (6). The MS data of the starting material and the
side products are the following: PPN m/z (rel %) 131 (30), 91 (100), 77 (4), 65 (10), 51 (6); BPPA m/z (rel %) 253 (18), 148 (100), 117 (16),
105 (7), 91 (99), 77 (10), 65 (12), 56 (11); TPPA m/z (rel %) 371 (4), 266 (90), 252 (2), 162 (30),
117 (10), 91 (100), 77 (5), 58 (80); PPAL m/z (rel %) 134 (71), 115 (10), 105 (35), 91 (100), 78 (44),
65 (16), 51 (21); PPOH m/z (rel
%) 136 (21), 117 (100), 105 (13), 91 (88), 77 (18), 65 (17), 51 (13).
These results are in conjunction with the literature analytical data.42

Catalyst Reusing
After filtering
the spent 10% Pd/C
catalyst, it was washed with distilled water (2 × 10 cm3) and collected carefully to store for the sequent reaction, in the
wet form. No further regenerative treatments were applied prior to
its reusing.

Recycling the Unreacted Starting Material
The second
hydrogenation was carried out by recycling the byproduct obtained
from the first reaction and complemented by fresh PPN to 5.0 g. The
reactions were performed as described in section Hydrogenation Reactions.

Catalyst Characterization
The metal content of the
fresh and the reused Pd/C catalysts was measured by energy-dispersive
XRF spectroscopy using an isotope-excited XRF analyzer.43 A ring-shaped 125I source was applied
for excitation, and a lead container with an aluminum collimator was
used for shielding. The detector was a Canberra SSL 80160 Si(Li-drifted)
semiconductor with a thickness of 5 mm and a surface area of 80 mm2 placed in a cooled space. Its resolution was 160 eV at an
energy level of 5.9 keV.

Dispersion of the catalyst (D10%Pd/C = 0.50) was determined by O2-, H2-, and CO chemisorption measurements using an atmospheric
flow system.44,45 Before the first adsorption of
O2, the catalyst sample was treated with H2 in
Ar at 90 °C for 2.5 h and then cooled to 25 °C in Ar only
to avoid hydrogen absorption in the bulk phase of palladium. (Pd–H)s was titrated with O2 injections via a calibrated
loop (0.1 cm3 each) at 25 °C. Then, (Pd–O)s was titrated with H2 in the same way. CO chemisorption
was also measured after treating in hydrogen (90 °C, 2.5 h).
The following stoichiometry was used for the calculations:adsorption of O2

Analysis
The product and the byproducts
were analyzed
and identified by GC–MS, as well as 1H and 13C NMR measurements.

GC–MS analyses were performed
using an Agilent 7890A GC-system (7683 autosampler and 7683B injector)
connected to an Agilent 5975C mass spectrometer using a Restek Rxi-5Sil
MS capillary column (15 m × 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 μm film).
The temperature program was the following: 70 °C (1 min) to 300
°C at 33 °C/min, hold 2 min.

The NMR spectra were
recorded in chloroform-D1 (CDCl3) on a Bruker AV-300 spectrometer
operating at 300 and 75 MHz, respectively. The chemical shift values
(δ) are given relatively to that of δTMS.

Computational Methods
DFT calculations of the adsorption
geometries and energies were carried out using the Quantum ESPRESSO
software package.46 The exchange–correlation
functional utilized was the Perdew−Burke−Ernzerhof (PBE)
of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the plane wave ultrasoft
pseudopotential approach.47 The energy
cut-off of the plane wave basis set was 50 Ry, and the convergence
criterion of the self-consistent accuracy was adjusted to 1 ×
10–6.

A three-layer periodic slab with upper
atoms allowed to relax was used to model the Pd(111) surface. A (4
× 4) supercell including a 10 Å vacuum slab was applied
to study the adsorption of the imine-type intermediates. The Monkhorst–Pack
scheme k-point grid sampling of a (2 × 2 ×
1) was used in all calculations over the entire Brillouin zone.

Adsorption energies (ΔEads) were
calculated according to eq 4 4  where Eimine+Pd(111) is the total energy of the adsorbed imine
intermediate on the Pd(111)
surface, EPd(111) is the energy of the
Pd(111) slab itself, and Eimine is the
energy of the imine molecule in vacuum.
