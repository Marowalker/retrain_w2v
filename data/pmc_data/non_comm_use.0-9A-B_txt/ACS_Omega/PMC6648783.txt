the electronic and optical properties of a thiophene-based covalent
triazine framework (TBCTF). We have found that TBCTF is a direct band
gap semiconductor. Our calculations reveal that constitutional isomerism
is a tool for band gap tuning. The variation of band gap can be achieved
by the bilayer TBCTF formation and further can be tuned by the z-axial strain. We have designed a new two-dimensional van
der Waals heterostructure g-ZnO/TBCTF, which shows type-II band alignment,
ensuring effective separation of photogenerated electron–hole
pairs. This composite system also exhibits enhanced absorption in
the visible range compared to that of individual g-ZnO and TBCTF monolayers.
Therefore, this composite system may find potential application in
photovoltaic devices. We have also investigated the hydrogen adsorption
ability of TBCTF through Li atom doping. Our results indicate that
the calculated hydrogen adsorption energies lie in the range, which
is suitable for reversible hydrogen storage under ambient conditions.
Therefore, the lithium-doped TBCTF may be a potential candidate for
the hydrogen storage material.

1 Introduction
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an emerging
class of two- or three-dimensional (2D/3D) crystalline porous materials.1−5 COFs are usually composed of lightweight
elements,6 such as B, C, N, H, O, and Si,
resulting in low mass density. The building subunits of these materials
are linked by strong covalent bonds, providing high thermal stability.
Because of large surface area and permanent porosity, COFs are emerged
as potential candidates for storage of gases, such as hydrogen, carbon
dioxide, methane, ammonia, and so forth.7−9 Researchers are eager about the interesting properties
of COFs, such as mechanical properties, chemical sensing, photoelectricity,
semiconductors, optoelectronics, and so forth.8,10−18

COFs are synthesized via reversible
covalent-bond forming reactions such as condensations.1 Various synthetic methods are employed to develop COFs,
namely, solvothermal synthesis,3 microwave
synthesis,19 ionothermal synthesis,20 and so forth. Over the past few years, experimental
studies mainly shed light on the rational design and controlled synthesis
of COFs to explore its various applications in gas storage/separation,
catalysis, chemical sensing, photoelectricity, energy storage, energy
conversion, and so forth.21−24

Nowadays, many interesting
electronic properties of COFs are revealed by several researchers
computationally and theoretically.25,26 Yang and Pushpa27 have reported how the variations of the X4Y unit can tune the optical and electronic properties of (X4Y) (O2B–C6H4–BO2)3 COF (where X = C/Si and Y = C, Si, Ge, Sn, and
Pb). They have also demonstrated that the absorption region can be
shifted from UV to visible by proper choice of X and Y. Zhu and Meunier28 have studied some single-layer COFs and have
shown the tuning of band gap by incorporating carbon chains or phenyl
rings into the side chains of HHTP-DPB-COF, COF-1, and CTF-1. As the
number of carbon chains or the phenyl rings increases, the band gap
decreases.28 However, the electronic properties
of these COFs remain unaltered when deposited on graphene, indicating
the robustness of its inherent properties. Zhou et al.25 have predicted that COF-5 shows effective carrier
separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, suggesting a potential
candidate for photovoltaic devices. They have also studied the optical
properties of TP-COF and NiPc-PBBA COF, indicating their applicability
in optoelectronic devices. Yang et al.29 have reported 10 new COFs, which show strong optical response in
the visible and near infrared region. Liang et al.30 have investigated the electronic properties of some COFs
and found that the variation of linkage conformation does not change
the electronic properties significantly. They have also suggested
that the presence of these COFs on the h-BN substrate causes reduction
of band gap because of the substrate polarization effect.30 Wang et al.31 have
suggested that the reason behind the flat band characteristics of
2D boroxine-linked COFs can be attributed to the little aromaticity
of the boroxine ring, which cannot effectively serve as an electron-transferring
bridge. They have also showed that the band gaps of these COFs can
be tuned by increasing the phenyl chains. Er et al.26 have explained the reason behind the excellent carrier
mobility and photoconductivity along the vertical direction of an
experimentally synthesized DA-COF. Very recently, Chakravarty et al.32 have explored the multifunctional application
of an azine-linked COF in the field of nanoelectronics to nitroexplosive
detection and conductance switching.

The band gap tuning may
be achieved through composite formation, which may lead to good photovoltaic
activity of COFs. Recently, the 2D graphitic ZnO33,34 (g-ZnO)
monolayer has attracted the attention of researchers because of its
exciting electronic properties. Wang et al.34 have proposed a MoS2/g-ZnO van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure,
which forms a typical type-II band alignment that causes the effective
separation of electron–hole pairs. Niu et al.33 have suggested that the g-ZnO-based vdW heterostructure,
g-ZnO/blue phosphorous (BP), shows an effective charge carrier separation
and large built-in electric field that ensures the photogenerated
electrons to migrate easily from g-ZnO to BP. Previously, no COF composite
has been studied, so, it would be interesting to study a way of band
gap tuning of COF by means of composite formation.

COFs possess
high surface area and tunable pore size. Therefore, many researchers
focus on their use as a hydrogen storage material. For mobile applications,
a lightweight hydrogen storing material is desired and the adsorption
energy should lie in between physisorption and chemisorption energy,
where hydrogen is mainly adsorbed in molecular form.35−37 Mendoza-Cortes et al.38 have synthesized a COF, namely, COF-301-PdCl2 that shows superior hydrogen storage under ambient conditions.
As suggested by earlier studies,37,39−45 simple vdW surfaces cannot hold hydrogen
strongly and the hydrogen adsorption enthalpies can be significantly
increased by the presence of charged sites. To search for better hydrogen
storage materials, alkali and alkaline earth metal-decorated porous
organic frameworks have attracted the attention of researchers. Gao
et al.44 have shown that Ca-intercalated
COF-1 shows better hydrogen storage capacity at 300 K and 20 bar compared
to bare COF-1, under same condition. Choi et al.46 have carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations
on some 3D COFs (COF-102, COF-103, COF-105, and COF-108) and found
that the lithium- and magnesium-decorated COFs are suitable candidates
for hydrogen storage media.

Very recently, Huang et al.47 have reported a thiophene-based covalent triazine
framework (TBCTF) for metal-free, visible-light promoted selective
oxidation of alcohols into corresponding aldehydes and ketones. In
this article, we have investigated the detail electronic and optical
properties of this COF to show its applicability in various fields.
Constitutional isomers of TBCTF are used with the aim of band gap
engineering. We have modeled bilayer COF and investigated how the
electronic properties are affected under z-axial
strain. A vdW heterostructure, g-ZnO/COF, is constructed to explore
its photovoltaic activity. Finally, we have introduced lithium atoms
on this COF and investigated its hydrogen adsorption ability.

2 Computational Details
All of the electronic structure calculations were performed based
on DFT by using Vienna ab initio simulation package.48−50 For all elemental constituents,
projector augmented wave potentials have been taken into account.
The plane-wave cutoff energy was set to 400 eV. The generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) developed by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE)
has been utilized for treating the exchange correlation functional Exc[ρ].51 For
structural optimizations and total energy calculations, the Brillouin
zone sampling was carried out by using 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack
(MP) k-point grids, whereas electronic structure
calculations were performed with 7 × 7 × 1 MP grids.52 A large vacuum space of 20 Å was added
along z-direction in order to avoid interactions
between periodic images. The convergence criteria for total energy
calculations in the self-consistent field iteration step were set
to 1 × 10–6 eV, and the atomic positions in
the structure were relaxed until the force on each atom becomes less
than 0.01 eV/Å. To consider the weak vdW interaction in the case
of the g-ZnO/COF heterostructure, lithium adsorption, and hydrogen
adsorption, the Grimmes DFT-D2 (PBE-D2) dispersion corrected method53 was applied. The Bader charge density analysis54 was performed to calculate the charges on the
atoms.

The optical properties were calculated using the frequency-dependent
complex dielectric function: ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω). The imaginary part of
the dielectric function ε2(ω) was obtained
with the help of first-order time-dependent perturbation theory. In
the long wavelength limit, the imaginary part is given by, 1  where ω is the frequency of electromagnetic
radiation. Ω denotes the volume of the unit cell, and ε0 is the free-space dielectric constant. CB and VB represent
the conduction and valence bands, respectively. The polarization vector
of the electric field of electromagnetic radiation and the position
vector is represented by u⃗ and r⃗, respectively. The real part of the dielectric function, ε1(ω), is evaluated from the imaginary part with the help
of Kramers–Kronig relation.

After determining the real
and imaginary parts of dielectric function, various optical properties,
such as absorption coefficient [α(ω)] and reflectivity
[R(ω)], can be obtained with the help of the
following equations 2   3  

3 Results and Discussion
The
optimized geometric structure of the 2D covalent triazine framework,
TBCTF, is shown in Figure 1. The optimized lattice constant for TBCTF is 13.515 Å.
As shown in Figure 1, the unit cell of TBCTF consists of two building blocks, namely,
thiophene and triazine. We now focus on the electronic structure of
TBCTF. From the electronic band structure, plotted in Figure 2a, we have found that TBCTF
is a direct band gap semiconductor with the band gap of 2.385 eV.
A closer inspection of the band structure reveals that both the valence
band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) possess flat
band characteristic. Similar results were previously observed by Er
et al.26 and Wang et al.31 These flat band characteristic is an indication of localized
wave function corresponding to the VBM and CBM states. To explain
the flat band characteristic, we have plotted the band decomposed
charge density of CBM and VBM states in Figure 2b,c, respectively. From Figure 2b,c, we notice that the charge
density corresponding to CBM and VBM is highly localized and there
is a node passing through the cross-conjugated position55 of TBCTF.

structure of 2 × 2 × 1 supercell of a TBCTF. The unit cell

structure plot of TBCTF. The Fermi
level is indicated by the red dashed line. Charge density distribution

Two constitutional isomers are
made by changing the position of sulfur atoms within the thiophene
moiety of TBCTF. We have modeled two systems, namely, TBCTF1 and TBCTF2,
shown in the inset of Figure 3a,d. In TBCTF1, the linking of two terminal thiophene moieties
with the triazine moiety is changed from C-2 to C-3. In TBCTF2, the
same linking change as in the case of TBCTF1 is carried out and in
addition to that the linking of middle thiophene moiety to one of
the triazine ring is changed from C-2 to C-3. Now, we have studied
how the electronic properties change with respect to change in the
linking position of the building blocks. We have plotted the band
structure and band decomposed charge density corresponding to the
VBM and CBM states of both TBCTF1 and TBCTF2 in Figure 3. A closer look of Figure 3a,d indicates that the flat band characteristics
of VBM and CBM states still remain in TBCTF1 as in the case of TBCTF,
but in the case of TBCTF2, CBM becomes slightly dispersive. It may
be noted that the curvature of Dirac-like cone at K-point above CBM, which is present in TBCTF, disappears as we go
from TBCTF to TBCTF1 and TBCTF2. From the electronic band structure,
we have found that both TBCTF1 and TBCTF2 are direct band gap semiconductors
at Γ point with the band gap of 2.50 and 2.724 eV, respectively.
The band gap increases as we go from TBCTF to TBCTF1 and TBCTF2. In
TBCTF, the thiophene unit is attached with the triazine unit via C-2,
which is more nucleophilic in character than C-3. However, in TBCTF1,
the thiophene unit is attached with the triazine unit via C-3. Therefore,
the electron-donating effect of thiophene is greater in the case of
TBCTF than that in TBCTF1. In TBCTF2, the number of linkage of thiophene
with triazine via less nucleophilic carbon center (C-3) increases.
This may be the reason for band gap increase from TBCTF to TBCTF1
to TBCTF2. Therefore, the band gap of TBCTF can be effectively tuned
by simply changing the position of sulfur atoms. Similar results were
previously reported by Gutzler.56

As we obtain a tool for band gap engineering through constitutional
isomerization, we turn our attention toward the optical properties
of TBCTF, TBCTF1, and TBCTF2. We have considered both the parallel
and perpendicular polarization for the calculation of optical properties.
Our calculated optical band gap is in good agreement with the experimentally
reported optical band gap of 2.47 eV.47 From the reflectivity spectra (Figure 4b,d), we have found that all of the COFs
have very low reflectivity specially along the perpendicular polarization.
Lower reflectivity along perpendicular direction may be due to large
number of pores along that direction.27 The magnitude of reflectivity at zero energy, R(0), is much lower than that of previously reported COFs.27 Such low reflectivity is very much useful for
optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells and LEDs.

coefficient [α(ω)] and (d) reflectivity [R(ω)] along perpendicular direction.

Recently,
Jiang et al.57 have reported that multilayer
formation is an efficient way to promote the transport of charge carriers,
which leads to the reduction of band gap. Inspired by this idea, we
have explored the electronic properties of bilayer TBCTF. COF layers
are stacked via weak vdW interaction and may take up various stacking
patterns. We have considered two stacking patterns, namely, AA and
AB stacking. We have designed AA stacking pattern by superimposing
one COF layer over another by maintaining some distance and AB stacking
is modeled from AA stacking by displacing the second layer with respect
to the first layer by (1/2a1, 1/2a2) in the basal plane. In order to explore which
stacking pattern is energetically more favorable, we have calculated
the binding energy, Eb, between two layers
using the following equation 4  where Ebilayer TBCTF and Emonolayer TBCTF are total
energies of bilayer and monolayer TBCTF, respectively. A negative
value of the binding energy implies that the formation of bilayer
TBCTF is energetically favorable. The calculated equilibrium interlayer
distances for AA stacking and AB stacking are 3.65 and 3.39 Å,
respectively. The calculated binding energy for AB stacking is found
to be 0.09 eV more negative than that of AA stacking. Therefore, AB
stacking is energetically more favorable than AA stacking, and we
now proceed to discuss electronic properties of bilayer TBCTF considering
AB stacking (Figure 5a). From Figure 5b,
we have found that bilayer TBCTF is also a direct band gap semiconductor
at Γ point and the band gap of TBCTF decreases from 2.385 to
2.173 eV because of bilayer formation. We have noticed that the band
structure of bilayer TBCTF looks like the superposition of band structure
of two individual monolayers with the shift of Fermi energy. The reason
behind the band gap decrease may be due to the interlayer coupling-induced
charge transfer as pointed out by Jiang et al.57 For better understanding, we have plotted charge density
difference of bilayer TBCTF (Figure S1),
which shows that there is a redistribution of charge density between
two adjacent layers. This redistribution of charge density induces
charge transfer between TBCTF layers. The electronic band structure
of AA-stacked bilayer TBCTF is also plotted (Figure S2), and the calculated band gap is 1.997 eV, which is slightly
less than that of AB-stacked bilayer. Similar results were previously
reported by Jiang et al.57

and side

The vertical
strain is proven to be an effective way for tuning the electronic
properties of the vdW heterostructure through changing the interaction
between adjacent layers.58−60 Inspired by this idea, we have applied strain along z-axis to modulate the electronic properties of bilayer TBCTF. The
vertical strain along z-axis can be defined as ε
= d0 – d, where d0 and d are the equilibrium
and strained distances between two successive layers, respectively.
As shown in Figure 5c, the total energy increases slowly with the increase of interlayer
distance and the same increases steeply in the case of compressive
strain. As the distance between two layers increases (decreases),
band gap increases (decreases), as shown in Figure 5d.

Next, we have investigated the electronic
properties of the g-ZnO/TBCTF vdW heterostructure for band gap engineering
and photovoltaic applications. A 4 × 4 × 1 supercell of
the g-ZnO monolayer is shown in Figure 6a, which is similar to that of graphene. The optimized
lattice constant of the g-ZnO monolayer is calculated to be 3.33 Å,
which is consistent with previous experimental and theoretical results.33,34 The heterostructure is constructed by stacking the unit cell of
TBCTF over 4 × 4 × 1 supercell of the g-ZnO monolayer. The
lattice mismatch58 for such heterostructure
is only 1.5%. The top and side views of the optimized g-ZnO/TBCTF
heterostructure are shown in Figure 6c,d, respectively. The calculated equilibrium interlayer
distance between g-ZnO and TBCTF is 3.16 Å. The binding energy
of the heterostructure is calculated with the help of the following
equation 5  where Eg-ZnO/TBCTF, Eg-ZnO, and ETBCTF are total energies of g-ZnO/TBCTF composite, g-ZnO, and TBCTF, respectively.
The binding energy of the heterostructure is −6.11 eV, which
suggests that the formation of g-ZnO/TBCTF is energetically favorable.
The projected band structure of the heterostructure is shown in Figure 6e. The band gap decrease
from 2.385 eV (in TBCTF) to 1.223 eV (in g-ZnO/TBCTF heterostructure)
is due to the insertion of bands of g-ZnO into the band gap region
of TBCTF. The interlayer coupling induces charge transfer (0.064e) from g-ZnO to TBCTF. We have found that the VBM is localized
on g-ZnO, whereas the CBM is contributed by the states arising from
TBCTF as shown in the band decomposed charge density (Figure 6f,g). This is also consistent
with the projected band structure. Therefore, we can say that g-ZnO/TBCTF
forms type-II band alignment, which is useful for effective separation
of electron–hole pairs. Thus, g-ZnO/TBCTF may be a potential
candidate for photovoltaic applications. The efficiency of a solar
cell depends upon two factors: (i) the spatial separation of charge
carriers, which reduces the rate of recombination, and (ii) the rate
of electron transfer from the CBM of the donor to the CBM of the acceptor.
The electron transfer rate depends on the energy difference between
CBM of the donor and acceptor. Larger the energy difference, larger
is the rate of electron transfer and hence higher efficiencies. As
explored in many previous studies,61−66 this energy gap can be tuned
by changing the size/shape of quantum dots or by introducing functional
groups. It is well known that the interior of the pore can be functionalized
as revealed by many previous studies.67−69 With this motivation, we have investigated the effect
of functionalization on TBCTF to engineer the energy gap between the
CBM of g-ZnO and TBCTF. The middle thiophene moiety of the TBCTF unit
cell is functionalized with (i) one cyano (−CN) group and (ii)
one nitro (−NO2) group. In Figure 7, we have plotted the energy level of VBM
and CBM of the composite systems along with those of isolated monolayers.64,70−72 From
this figure, we have noticed that both (−CN and −NO2) functionalization increases the energy gap between CBM of
g-ZnO and TBCTF. This energy gap is a measure of electron injection
rate from the CBM of the donor to the CBM of the acceptor. This energy
gap further increases with the increase of number of −CN/–NO2 groups (Figure S3). Thus, we can
conclude that −CN/–NO2-functionalized g-ZnO/TBCTF
composite systems show better photovoltaic activity than the nonfunctionalized
one. Moreover, we have functionalized TBCTF with one methoxy group
(−OCH3) and found that the composite system shows
type-I band alignment, where both VBM and CBM are contributed by g-ZnO.
However, when we functionalize TBCTF with one cyano (−CN) and
one nitro (−NO2) group, the composite system shows
type-II band alignment with better activity than that of the nonfunctionalized
one.

composite systems (bold) and that of isolated monolayers. The VBM
of g-ZnO is set to zero energy.

To have applicability in photovoltaic devices, the material
should absorb as much as UV/visible light. Thus, we have investigated
the optical properties of the g-ZnO/TBCTF composite. From Figure 8a,b, we can see that
there occurs enhanced absorption in the case of g-ZnO/TBCTF composite
and also in −CN/–NO2-functionalized g-ZnO/TBCTF
composite compared to individual components along both parallel and
perpendicular polarization. Thus, we strongly believe that the composite
system, g-ZnO/TBCTF and the −CN/–NO2-functionalized
g-ZnO/TBCTF composite may find potential applications in photovoltaic
devices.

Recent experimental and theoretical studies reveal
that COFs are potential candidates for hydrogen storage media. Therefore,
we have investigated the hydrogen adsorption ability of TBCTF through
lithium atom doping. First of all, the most favorable binding site
for lithium atoms on TBCTF is determined. Two different sites are
possible, one is above the triazine ring and the other is above the
thiophene ring. We have calculated the lithium binding energy using
the following equation 6  where ELi-TBCTF, ETBCTF, and ELi are total energies of lithium
decorated TBCTF, TBCTF, and lithium atom, respectively. n is the number of lithium atom. The calculated binding energy (per
lithium atom) on triazine and thiophene moieties are −1.377
and −1.96 eV, respectively. Thus, we can say that the lithium
atom preferably adsorb on above and below the thiophene ring. The
binding energy of Li on the thiophene moiety is even more negative
than the cohesive energy of metallic lithium (−1.63 eV).43 The optimized structure of Li-TBCTF is shown
in Figure 9a. The optimized
lattice constant of Li-TBCTF is 13.62 Å, which is slightly greater
than that of bare TBCTF. Thus, optimized cell constant undergoes slight
expansion on Li adsorption. Lithium atoms adsorbed on the upper side
of TBCTF are 2.62 Å away from the sulfur atom of thiophene, whereas
the corresponding distance for the lower side is found to be 2.29
Å. Two different distances are found as sulfur atoms of thiophene
moieties move slightly downward from the basal plane. The calculated
distance between two Li atoms adsorb on the opposite side of a thiophene
ring is 3.66 Å. The Bader charge analysis reveals that each Li
atom on the upper surface carries 0.86e positive
charge, whereas each on the lower surface carries 0.82e positive charge, suggesting a charge transfer from Li to TBCTF.
Thus, one can expect that partial positive charge generated on Li
atoms can polarize the molecular hydrogen and bind it through ion-quadrupole
and ion-induced dipole interactions as revealed by many previous studies.37,39−44

unit cell of (a) lithium doped TBCTF (Li-TBCTF) and (b–d) hydrogen
molecule decorated Li-TBCTF [(H2)n–Li–TBCTF], where n = 6, 12,
18.

Next, we turn our focus on the hydrogen adsorption
ability of Li-functionalized TBCTF by introducing H2 molecules
on the top of Li atoms in a stepwise manner. At first, one H2 molecule is placed on each Li atom. After geometry optimization,
we have observed that Li atoms attract H2 molecules toward
itself and also H2 molecules are slightly tilted toward
TBCTF, indicating that H2 molecules also interact with
TBCTF. The optimized geometry of Li-TBCTF with one H2 molecule
per Li is shown in Figure 9b. The shortest Li–H distance is found to be 1.90 Å.
We have calculated the hydrogen adsorption energy of the Li-doped
TBCTF by means of the following equation 7  where E(H2)n–Li-TBCTF, ELi-TBCTF, and EH2 are total energies of Li-TBCTF containing n number
of hydrogen molecules,
Li-TBCTF, and hydrogen molecule, respectively. Our calculated results
for hydrogen adsorption energies, shortest Li–H distances,
and H–H bond lengths are listed in Table 1. Using PBE-D2 (GGA–PBE) method, the
adsorption energy per hydrogen molecule is calculated to be −0.35
eV (−0.16 eV). The H–H bond length is 0.771 Å,
which is slightly longer than that found in pure H2 (bond
length = 0.75 Å).37

(H2)18–Li-TBCTF	–0.26	–0.11	1.96	0.761	
Next, we
have introduced two H2 molecules per Li atom, and the corresponding
optimized geometry is shown in Figure 9c. In this case, the binding energy per hydrogen molecule
is −0.33 eV (−0.15 eV), which is less than that of former
one. The shortest Li–H distance and the H–H bond length
are 1.93 and 0.767 Å, respectively. Furthermore, we have decorated
Li-TBCTF with three hydrogen molecules per Li atom, and the corresponding
optimized geometry is presented in Figure 9d. Here, hydrogen molecules are found to
be adsorbed with the binding energy of −0.26 eV (−0.11
eV). The H–H bond length gets slight expansion. Hydrogen adsorption
interaction by Li-TBCTF can be more clearly explored by non-covalent
isosurfaces,73,74 where the blue region indicates
strong attractive attractions (Figure S4). However, the decrease of binding energy with the increase of H2 molecule concentration indicates that only a limited number
of H2 molecules can be adsorbed.43 We have also decorated Li-TBCTF with four hydrogen molecules per
Li and found that H2 molecules get far away from Li centers.
The repulsion between the adsorbed hydrogen molecules may be the reason
for this.37 Therefore, each Li atom in
Li-TBCTF can hold maximum three hydrogen molecules, which leads to
the maximum storage capacity37 of 7.40
wt %. For reversible hydrogen storage under ambient conditions, the
hydrogen binding energy should lie in the range of −0.2 to
−0.6 eV as suggested by many previous studies.39,42,75 Our computed binding energies
also lie in this range, suggesting that Li-decorated TBCTF may find
application as hydrogen storage devices.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we have investigated
the electronic and optical properties of recently synthesized TBCTF
COF based on first-principles calculations. Our electronic structure
calculation reveals that TBCTF is a direct band gap semiconductor,
which may find application in semiconductor-based electronic devices.
The band gap of TBCTF can be engineered through constitutional isomerism
and bilayer TBCTF formation. We have proposed a new 2D g-ZnO/TBCTF
vdW heterostructure. Our computational study suggests that the synthesis
of the heterostructure is energetically feasible. The heterostructure
is also a direct band gap semiconductor with type II band alignment,
indicating the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and
holes. The VBM is localized on g-ZnO and the CBM is dominated by TBCTF
in the heterostructure. This type of spatial separation of charge
carriers is suitable for application in photovoltaic devices. Furthermore,
the −CN/–NO2-functionalized g-ZnO/TBCTF shows
better photovoltaic activity than the nonfunctionalized one. Optical
property calculations show that the composite systems absorb more
strongly in the visible region than the individual components. Therefore,
our proposed composite systems g-ZnO/TBCTF and −CN/–NO2-functionalized g-ZnO/TBCTF may find its applicability as
a light harvesting material. Moreover, we have systematically investigated
the hydrogen adsorption ability of TBCTF through the doping of Li
atoms. We have found that Li atoms adsorb preferably on the thiophene
ring. Each Li atom can adsorb a maximum of three hydrogen molecules
around it, leading to the theoretical hydrogen storage capacity of
7.40 wt %. The hydrogen adsorption energy indicates that Li-TBCTF
can be used as a reversible hydrogen storage material under ambient
conditions. Thus, we strongly believe that the g-ZnO/TBCTF (functionalized
and nonfunctionalized) heterostructure may find potential applications
in photovoltaic devices, and the Li-doped TBCTF can find its applicability
as a hydrogen storage material.
