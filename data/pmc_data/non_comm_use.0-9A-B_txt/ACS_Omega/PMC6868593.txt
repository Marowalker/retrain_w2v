Physically reinforced
short-side-chain perfluorinated sulfonic
acid electrolyte membranes were fabricated by annealing and using
a porous support. Five types of solution-cast membranes were produced
from commercial perfluorinated ionomers (3M and Aquivion (AQ)) with
different equivalent weights, annealed at different temperatures,
and characterized in terms of ion conductivity, water uptake, and
in-plane/through-plane swelling, while the effect of annealing on
physical structure of membranes was evaluated by small-angle X-ray
scattering and dynamic mechanical analysis. To create a reinforced
composite membrane (RCM), we impregnated a polytetrafluoroethylene
porous support with 3M 729 and AQ 720 electrolytes exhibiting excellent
proton conductivity and water uptake. The electrolyte impregnation
stability for the porous support was evaluated using a solvent resistance
test, and the best performance was observed for the 3M 729 RCM annealed
at 200 °C. Both annealed and nonannealed 3M 729 RCMs were used
to produce membrane electrode assemblies, the durability of which
was evaluated by open-circuit voltage combined wet–dry cycling
tests. The nonannealed 3M 729 RCM survived 5800 cycles, while the
3M 729 RCM annealed at 200 °C survived 16 600 cycles and
thus exhibited improved mechanical durability.

1 Introduction
The
environmentally friendly nature and high energy efficiency
of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) make them promising
power sources for transportation.1 In particular,
perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) electrolyte membranes feature the advantages
of high proton conductivity and physicochemical stability, and have
therefore become representative cation exchange membranes used in
PEMFCs.2 The PFSA polymer comprises a hydrophobic
poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) main chain and hydrophilic side chains
ending with sulfonic acid groups. The PTFE backbone provides mechanical
strength by engaging in crystalline structure formation, while the
side-chain sulfonic acid groups facilitate proton transport by engaging
in the formation of ion transport pathways.3

Ion conductivity and durability are the most important indicators
of PFSA membrane performance. Specifically, ion conductivity is the
most important factor determining the ohmic resistance of the membrane
electrode assembly (MEA) in PEMFCs and is mainly influenced by the
concentration of sulfonic acid groups (often equivalent weight (EW)
or ion exchange capacity (IEC)) in the PFSA polymer. EW is defined
as the molecular weight of the PFSA ionomer per mmol of sulfonic acid
groups, while IEC refers to the ion exchange capacity determined by
the concentration of sulfonic acid groups (Figure 1). As the EW and IEC of the same polymer
structure directly affect the concentration of the ion transport carrier,
they are important indices determining the conductivity of the electrolyte
membrane.

Figure 1 Chemical structures of (a) Nafion, (b) 3M, and (c) Aquivion ionomers.

Nafion, first developed by DuPont in 1960 and long
studied as an
ionomer binder in polymer electrolyte membranes and catalyst layers,
features several limitations due to its long-side-chain (LSC) form
and an EW of ≥1100 g/meq. 3 In contrast, the recently
developed Aquivion (Solvay) and PFSA (3M) ionomers have the advantage
of lowered EW (<1100) and short side chains (SSCs).4,5 Compared to long-side-chain PFSA (LSC-PFSA), SSC-PFSA exhibits increased
durability due to the lower risk of deterioration by the shorter side
chains and the reduced numbers of ether groups and tertiary carbon
atoms.6,7 In particular, the decreased side chain
length can increase the crystallinity of the main chain (which affects
the mechanical properties of the electrolyte membrane) and hence elevate
glass transition temperature (Tg).4,7−9 SSC membranes have lower EWs (almost to 700 g/meq)
than those of LSC membranes and allow fuel cells to be operated at
higher proton conductivities and temperatures. For this reason, much
research is currently performed on SSC-PFSA as potential ionomers
to replace LSC-PFSA.10

PFSA durability
and proton conductivity should be improved for
PEMFC commercialization. In general, the failure mechanisms of PFSA
electrolyte membranes involve chemical and physical degradation.11−14 Chemical degradation is caused by the attack of hydroxyl radicals
generated by (i) side reactions during fuel cell operation or (ii)
crossover of H2 and O2 gas fuel on the electrolyte
membrane.15,16 Physical deterioration is caused by the
repeated swelling and drying of the membrane during the start/stop
cycling of the fuel cell and results in membrane failure.17

Chemical deterioration can be prevented
through the addition of
external antioxidants. Metal (e.g., Ce) ions were used as antioxidants
in early studies,18,19 while in later investigations,
the scope was expanded to metal oxides,20−24 metal nanoscale composites,25−29 transition metal–ligand complexes,30 transition metals immobilized on supports,31,32 bimetallic antioxidants,33 organic antioxidants,34,35 and polymeric antioxidants.36,37 In addition, we have
recently reported a problem of Ce3+ usage, revealing that
although this species improves the long-term durability of polymer
membranes, it concomitantly reduces proton conductivity.19 To mitigate this problem and demonstrate that
oxidative stability can be improved without sacrificing proton conductivity,
hydrocarbon composite membranes and perfluorinated composite membranes
impregnated with organic antioxidants were developed.34,35

Annealing and physical reinforcement through the use of porous
supports are well-known methods of improving the mechanical durability
of electrolyte membranes. To realize thin and strong electrolyte membranes
expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (ePTFE) porous supports can be
impregnated with the PFSA ionomer, which has already been commercialized
by Gore.38,39 On the other hand, the annealing-induced
improvement of physical properties is ascribed to the concomitant
increase in the polymer crystallization degree and the decrease in
the free volume between polymer chains.40−42 Therefore, several studies
have been conducted on Nafion (i.e., LSC-PFSA) to confirm the effects
of annealing conditions such as temperature, time, and humidification
on membrane physical structure changes and electrochemical properties.42−51

Despite the abovementioned advantages of SSC-PFSA EW and crystallinity,
the effects of annealing on SSC-PFSA performance have been underexplored.
In particular, no systematic research has been conducted on SSC-reinforced
composite membranes used in real fuel cells. Therefore, research to
optimize the annealing process for 3M and Aquivion is needed to improve
the performance of SSC-PFSA-based PEMFCs.

Herein, a systematic
investigation was conducted to improve the
durability of SSC-PFSA electrolyte membranes. Membranes were produced
for each EW using a commercial PFSA electrolyte, annealed under various
conditions, and evaluated in terms of ion conductivity, water uptake,
and swelling ratio before/after annealing. The effect of annealing
on the physical structure of PFSA was probed by small-angle X-ray
scattering (SAXS) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The porous
ePTFE support was impregnated with the PFSA ionomer with the best
proton conductivity and water uptake properties to produce a reinforced
composite membrane (RCM). To determine the optimum annealing temperature,
the RCM was annealed within a wide temperature range. Finally, the
electrolyte membrane with the best performance and durability was
used for MEA fabrication and subjected to an open-circuit voltage
(OCV) combined wet–dry cycling test, which was conducted according
to the protocol newly proposed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)
in 2016 to evaluate both chemical and mechanical durability at the
same time.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effects
of Annealing on Solution-Cast Membranes
2.1.1 Conductivity
and Water Uptake
As
shown in Figure 1,
solution-cast membranes were produced using 3M ionomers (EW 729 and
825) and AQ ionomers (EW 720, 790, and 830), and named as 3M 729,
3M 825, AQ 720, AQ 790, and AQ 830. All five types of membranes were
fabricated to have similar thicknesses of 55–60 μm to
minimize the effect of thickness variation. Figure 2a compares the effects of annealing temperature
on proton conductivity, revealing that the proton conductivity of
the nonannealed membrane increased with decreasing EW and was higher
for AQ membranes than for 3M membranes in the case of similar EW.
The conductivity of all types of membranes decreased with increasing
annealing temperature, as did their water uptake (Figure 2b). This finding was ascribed
to changes in polymer morphology due to the formation of crystalline
regions in the main chain of polymers during annealing. This increased
crystallinity increased the suppressive force for the polymer membrane
swelling ratio and hence decreased the water uptake and proton conductivity.

Figure 2 (a) Proton
conductivities and (b) water uptakes of 3M 729, 3M 825,
AQ 720, AQ 790, and AQ 830 membranes annealed at 140, 160, and 180
°C.

Figure 3 shows the
relative humidity (RH)-dependent proton conductivity of 3M 729 and
AQ 720 membranes before and after annealing at 180 °C, revealing
that the proton conductivity of both membranes decreased after annealing
for all RH conditions. Prior to this, the concern about the decomposition
of sulfonic acid during the annealing process was verified by measuring
IECs. As listed in Table S1, the IEC of
3M 729 decreased from 1.36 to 1.30 meq/g upon annealing; that of AQ
720 also decreased from 1.41 to 1.31 meq/g. For both membranes, IEC
values were slightly decreased by annealing, but it was not significant
to affect proton conductivity. Moreover, the difference in conductivity
before and after the annealing at low RH region became larger, whereas
the difference at high RH seems to be not significant. In the case
of 3M 729, the conductivity at 100% RH decreased by 18% upon annealing
(from 128 to 106 mS/cm), and a more significant decrease by 32% was
observed at 30% RH (from 1.7 to 1.1 mS/cm). Similarly, the conductivity
of the AQ 720 membrane showed a small reduction rate by 14% (from
130 to 112 mS/cm) at 100% RH and a high reduction rate by 29% (from
2.4 to 1.7 mS/cm) at 30% RH. It might be ascribed to the high sensitivity
of conductivity on the structural and morphological changes at low
humidity.

at 80 °C before and after the annealing process.

2.1.2 Dimensional Stability
In general,
fuel cells repeatedly start and stop during operation. The electrolyte
membrane reaches a dry condition in the stationary state and swells
during operation because of the generation of water in the cathode.
This wet–dry cycling reduces the physical durability of the
electrolyte membrane. Therefore, to be physically durable, the membrane
is required to have excellent dimensional stability. To investigate
the annealing-induced improvement in the dimensional stability of
the SSC-PFSA electrolyte membrane, we measured and compared in-plane
and through-plane swelling ratios (Figure 4), revealing that similarly to the water
uptake, they decreased with increasing annealing temperature. This
behavior is expected to enhance durability but may negatively affect
fuel cell performance by decreasing proton conductivity during fuel
cell operation. Additionally, annealing temperature did not have any
effect on membrane anisotropy, probably because the reduction rates
of in-plane and through-plane swelling ratios in the two membranes
were almost identical.

Figure 4 (a) In-plane and (b) through-plane swelling ratios of
3M 729, 3M
825, AQ 720, AQ 790, and AQ 830 membranes annealed at 140, 160, and
180 °C.

2.1.3 SAXS
SAXS patterns were recorded
to observe the effects of annealing on membrane nanomorphology and
structure. In general, we observed two peaks centered at q ≈ 1.9 and 0.5 nm–1 that were ascribed to
the hydrophilic ionomer and the hydrophobic PTFE matrix, respectively.53−55 The former peak represents the distance between hydrophilic group
clusters, while the matrix peak represents the long-range correlation
of the lamellar structure of the main chain PTFE. As shown in Figure S1, peaks corresponding to two regions
of the matrix and the ionomer were observed.

The y-axis was amplified to Iq2 (where I is a scattered intensity and q is scattering vector) to observe the ionomer peak change
more clearly, and the result was compared to Figure 5a, with d-spacings (d = 2π/q) calculated using q values corresponding to peak maxima shown in Figure 5b. For the 3M 729
membrane, the intensity of the ionomer peak increased with increasing
annealing temperature, while an intensity increase up to 160 °C
followed by a decrease at higher temperature was observed for AQ 720. Figure 5b reveals that d-spacing increased with increasing temperature. In particular,
annealing increased ionomer peak intensity compared to that of the
nonannealed sample. Moreover, the matrix knee pattern of Figure S1 shows that even long-range clustering
in the hydrophobic region increased with increasing annealing temperature.
Considering these results, the extent of phase separation in the hydrophobic
matrix and the hydrophilic ionomer was concluded to increase with
increasing annealing temperature.

Figure 5 (a) Maximum intensities and (b) d-spacings of
ionomer peaks obtained for 3M 729 and AQ 720 annealed at 140, 160,
and 180 °C.

On the other hand, water
uptake and proton conductivity decreased
with increasing annealing temperature for both 3M and AQ membranes,
which, considering only the ionomer d-spacing, was
unusual. Increasing ionomer d-spacing increases the
extent of phase separation between hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains,
which is expected to result in elevated proton conductivity and water
uptake. However, the physical interaction between the hydrophobic
matrices also increased after annealing and thereby acted as a factor
reducing the water uptake.

2.1.4 DMA
Storage
modulus, loss modulus,
and tan δ were probed by DMA to gain further insights
into the effects of annealing. Figure 6 compares the above parameters of 3M 729 and AQ 720
membranes with relatively high proton conductivity before and after
annealing at 180 °C. For both membranes, annealing reduced the
storage modulus gradient. The initial storage modulus of the 3M 729
membrane increased by 23% upon annealing (from 643 to 830 MPa), while
that of the AQ 720 membrane increased by 18% (from 485 to 571 MPa).

Figure 6 DMA results
for (a) nonannealed 3M 729, (b) 3M 729 annealed at
180 °C, (c) nonannealed AQ 720, and (d) AQ 720 annealed at 180
°C.

Comparison of tan δ
curves showed that the Tg of 3M 729 increased
from 134 to 143 °C
after annealing, while that of AQ 720 increased from 131 to 139 °C.
Thus, annealing increased the membrane crystallization degree and,
hence, Tg and mechanical durability,43 in agreement with the aforementioned water uptake
behavior. Interestingly, annealing also increased the Tg of 3M 720, with a detailed explanation provided below.

2.1.5 PFSA Chemical Structure Considerations
Figure 7a,b shows
the absolute and relative contents of the individual components of
the PFSA ionomer, enabling an accurate comparison of 3M and AQ membranes
with similar EWs. Theoretically, the 3M membrane features a lower
main chain content and a higher side chain content than the AQ membrane
(Figure 7b), given
the same EW (i.e., the same ratio of sulfonic acid end groups), and
the two membranes are therefore expected to have different crystallization
degrees (Figure 7c).

Figure 7 (a) Absolute
and (b) relative weight fractions of the three domains
for various PFSA ionomers; (c) schematic representations of similar
EW 3M and Aquivion models.

In general, branched polymers with long side chains should have
a low degree of main chain crystallization, as has been reported in
many studies comparing LSC-PFSAs with SSC-PFSAs.9,16,56,57 However, the
results we obtained when investigating SSC-PFSA 3M and AQ were unexpected.
As shown in Figure 7, AQs with very short side chains were expected to show higher Tgs and improved phase separation (based on SAXS
and DMA results); however, their Tgs and d-spacings were lower than those of 3M PFSA. These findings
suggest that the longer side chain acts positively to phase separation
among SSC-PFSAs. In other words, the longer side chain (hydrophilic
domain) of 3M PFSA showed increased mobility and was therefore expected
to play an important role in the formation of hydrophilic region clusters.
For this reason, the d-spacing could be higher, which
further increased the phase separation with the hydrophobic region
connected to the same polymer chain. These results indicate that 3M
PFSA showed a more distinct phase separation even in the matrix knee
of the hydrophobic region, as shown in Figure S1.

2.2 Effects of Annealing on
RCMs
2.2.1 Conductivity and Water Uptake
In
the preceding experiment, 3M 729 and AQ 720 ionomers with excellent
proton conductivity and water uptake were used to produce RCMs with
the impregnated ePTFE porous support to further enhance mechanical
durability. The thus produced composite membranes had a thickness
of 25–30 μm (average = 27 μm). As shown in Figure S2, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectroscopy was used to confirm that the produced samples did not
undergo any chemical degradation in the temperature range used for
annealing.

Figure 8 shows that both proton conductivity and water uptake decreased with
increasing annealing temperature, which was ascribed to the concomitant
increase of crystallinity. The behavior of RCMs on both characteristics
was similar to that of solution-cast membranes. In comparison to solution-cast
membranes, the conductivity of nonannealed 3M 729 and AQ 720 membranes
was 146 and 149 mS/cm, respectively, while those of RCM_3M 729 and
RCM_AQ 720 presented 105 and 109 mS/cm. RCM showed slightly lower
conductivity than the nonreinforced one by introducing ePTFE support.
The ePTFE support has a porosity of 75% with about 10 μm thickness.
Thus, the volume of ePTFE support in RCM (27 μm thick) might
occupy around 9.3% contrast to nonreinforced parts. Since the nonconducting
region by ePTFE support caused the small loss of water absorption,
water uptake of solution-cast membranes, 3M 729 (37%) and AQ 720 (39%),
was almost 10% higher than those of reinforced membranes, RCM_3M 729
(27%) and RCM_AQ 720 (28%). Meanwhile, the conductivity of 3M 729
and AQ 720 membranes annealed at 180 °C was decreased to 134
and 136 mS/m, respectively. The conductivity of RCM_3M 729 and RCM_AQ
720 annealed at 200 °C was also reduced to 87 and 90 mS/cm, respectively.
As mentioned in Section 2.1.1, it is considered that the crystallinity of ionomers
gradually affects to suppress the water uptake of the membrane with
increasing annealing temperature.

Figure 8 (a) Proton conductivities and (b) water
uptakes of reinforced 3M
729 and AQ 720 membranes annealed at 140, 170, and 200 °C.

2.2.2 Dimensional Stability
To confirm
the increase of the dimensional stability of SSC-PFSA RCMs upon annealing,
we measured the corresponding in-plane and through-plane swelling
ratios (Figure 9),
revealing that they decreased with increasing annealing temperature.
The in-plane swelling ratio of RCM_3M 729 decreased from 24 to 16%,
while that of RCM_AQ 720 decreased from 26 to 18%. Moreover, the through-plane
swelling ratio of RCM_3M 729 decreased from 16 to 10%, and that of
RCM_AQ 720 decreased from 17 to 11%, which reflected the concomitantly
improved dimensional stability. In comparison to the in-plane swelling
ratio of nonreinforced membranes, the ratios of 3M 729 and AQ 720
membranes annealed at 180 °C were 28 and 32%, respectively, while
those of RCM_3M 729 and RCM_AQ 720 annealed at 170 °C presented
18 and 20%. RCM showed a much lower swelling ratio than nonreinforced
one even at the lower annealing temperature. The ePTFE support with
a porosity of 75% plays an important role as holding the electrolyte
within RCMs, thereby suppressing the swelling ratio of RCM contrast
to the nonreinforced one. Therefore, the introduction of the porous
support greatly improved dimensional stability, similarly to annealing.

Figure 9 (a) In-plane
and (b) through-plane swelling ratios of reinforced
3M 729 and AQ 720 membranes annealed at 140, 170, and 200 °C.

2.2.3 Solvent Resistance Test
The electrolyte
impregnation stability with respect to the RCM porous support was
evaluated by the accelerated solvent resistance test. RCMs were immersed
into ethanol for 3 days to observe the extent of electrolyte leakage
and the electrolyte present in the support pores through scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) imaging. As shown in Figure 10, the originally transparent composite membranes
turned white during the test, and the electrolyte impregnated into
the support escaped. Figure 10b,d shows that the amount of escaped electrolyte decreased
with increasing annealing temperature, and membranes annealed at 200
°C maintained a wider transparency region. As this behavior was
in good agreement with that of solution-cast membrane water uptake,
the increased polymer crystallization degree was ascribed to the increase
in the extent of PFSA phase separation with increasing annealing temperature
or to the concomitant decrease of water uptake.

Figure 10 Photographs and cross-sectional
SEM images of reinforced 3M 729
and AQ 720 membranes acquired (a, c) before and (b, d) after the solvent
resistance test.

After the solvent resistance
test, the cross-section of the RCM
annealed at 200 °C was observed by SEM to visually confirm the
degree of electrolyte loss (Figure 10). In Figure 10a,c, the red dotted lines show the enlarged support area of
RCM_3M 729 and RCM_AQ 720. Initially, the support fibrils were thickened
by the impregnated electrolyte, and the electrolyte-filled pores were
easily identifiable. However, after the solvent resistance test, the
support fibrils became tapered because of electrolyte leakage (Figure 10b,d). The region
of electrolyte leakage from the support was partially observed in
the large-scaled SEM images (Figure S3).
On the other hand, RCM_AQ 720 suffered more extreme electrolyte leakage
than RCM_3M 729, and the support of the former was torn into several
layers. Therefore, the electrolyte impregnation stability was concluded
to be higher in RCM_3M 729 than that in RCM_AQ 720.

2.3 OCV Combined Wet–Dry Cycling Test of
RCMs with the 3M 729 Ionomer
Among the two RCMs with similar
water uptakes and proton conductivities, the 3M 729 membrane showed
higher Tg and solvent resistance, and
was therefore used for MEA fabrication and evaluated using the OCV
combined wet–dry cycling test. This new accelerated degradation
assessment (AST) protocol was proposed by DOE to simultaneously assess
the mechanical and chemical durability of the MEA in a short time.58

The effect of annealing on RCM durability
was investigated by comparing samples before and after annealing. Figure 11 shows the OCV
change of the RCM-containing MEA during cycling. The nonannealed membrane
exhibited a dramatic performance decrease after 4000 cycles, i.e.,
the OCV was maintained only for 120 h, and the termination occurred
after 5800 cycles. In contrast, the membrane annealed at 200 °C
survived 16 600 cycles while stably maintaining OCV. On the
other hand, Mukundan et al. reported that an MEA including the Nafion
XL membrane, which is chemically and mechanically reinforced using
Ce ions and ePTFE, was stable until around 440 h by the OCV combined
wet–dry cycling test.59 Compared
to this result, it is considered that the annealed RCM-MEA considerably
endured against the new AST in this study. Furthermore, the OCV of
the nonannealed membrane decreased at a rate of 1.41 mV/h, whereas
a much smaller rate of 0.52 mV/h was observed for the annealed-membrane
MEA. The decomposition of the nonannealed electrolyte membrane was
rapid even under the conditions when its high-frequency resistance
(HFR) was checked every 1000 h. These results suggest that annealing
can greatly improve the chemical and mechanical durability of polymer
fuel cell RCMs and enhance the performance of the SSC-PFSA electrolyte
membranes by affecting the polymer structure.

Figure 11 OCV and HFR changes
in single cells assembled with nonannealed
and annealed reinforced 3M 729 membranes, as determined by the OCV
combined wet–dry test at 90 °C with a cycle duration of
30/45 s.

3 Conclusions
The mechanical stability of electrolyte membranes comprising short-side-chain
perfluorinated sulfonic acid polymers increased upon annealing, while
the use of a porous support allowed for physical reinforcement. The
decrease of proton conductivity, water uptake, and in-/through-plane
swelling ratios of 3M and Aquivion membranes upon annealing suggests
that membrane electrochemical characteristics can be changed by heat-induced
alteration of crystallinity and ion channel size. SAXS and DMA showed
that annealing enhances the phase separation of the electrolyte membrane
and thus increases its d-spacing and Tg. The effect of annealing was different for each electrolyte
membrane, being most pronounced for the 3M one, which suggests that
the use of slightly longer side chains improves the aggregation of
sulfonate group clusters and hence increases the crystallinity of
the hydrophobic region, the distance between clusters, and Tg.

The ePTFE porous support was impregnated
with the selected 3M 729
and AQ 720 electrolytes to produce RCMs that were annealed at 140,
170, or 200 °C. As in the case of the solution-cast membrane,
proton conductivity, water uptake, and swelling ratio of RCM decreased
with increasing annealing temperature. The stability of the polymer
electrolyte in the porous support was evaluated by the solvent resistance
test, and the highest stability was observed for the RCM_3M 729 membrane
annealed at 200 °C. As a result, annealing was concluded to affect
solution-cast and reinforced composite membranes in a similar way.
Single cells assembled with nonannealed and annealed RCMs survived
5800 and 16 600 cycles, respectively, and were concluded to
exhibit markedly different chemical and physical durabilities. Thus,
annealing under optimal conditions allowed the fabrication of high-performance
SSC-PFSA membranes with enhanced durabilities and proton conductivities.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Chemicals
3M PFSA powder-type
ionomers with EWs of 729 (E-21669D) and 825 (E-21669A) were purchased
from 3M Co. Aquivion PFSA dispersion-type ionomers with EWs of 720
(AQ D72-25BS), 790 (AQ D79-24BS), and 830 (AQ D83-25BS) were purchased
from Solvay Solexis. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP;
872-50-4, anhydrous, 99%) and ethanol (459836, 99.5%, extra pure)
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The porous ePTFE substrate (Product
code: #1326, Tetatex 0.07 μm PTFE membrane) was procured from
Donaldson Company, Inc., and used as received.

4.2 Preparation
and Annealing of PFSA Membranes
4.2.1 Solution-Cast
Membranes
3M and
Aquivion PFSA solutions (10 wt %) were prepared in NMP. In the former
case, the ionomer powder was simply dissolved in NMP, whereas in the
latter case, the original aqueous solution was subjected to solvent
substitution. Both PFSA solutions were filtered using a Whatman 0.45
μm PTFE syringe filter, cast on a glass plate (Figure 12a), and dried overnight on
a hot plate at 70 °C. The thus produced solution-cast membranes
were further dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 2 days to remove
the residual solvent, placed into 3 M aqueous HCl at 80 °C for
6 h, washed with distilled water, and dried at room temperature for
2–3 days. Annealing process of solution-cast membranes was
carried out at various temperatures of 140, 160, and 180 °C for
1 h in a vacuum condition. After that, the annealed membranes were
quenched to room temperature.

and (b) RCMs.

4.2.2 RCMs
As shown in Figure 12b, RCMs were fabricated in
four steps as follows: (i) a PFSA solution was cast on a glass plate
using a doctor blade, (ii) a porous ePTFE substrate was placed on
top of the bottom PFSA layer, (iii) the top layer of PFSA was formed
by a second PFSA solution casting, (iv) the layered membranes were
dried overnight on the hot plate at 70 °C. As in the case of
solution-cast membranes, RCMs were further dried in a vacuum oven
at 80 °C for 2 days, treated with 3 M HCl at 80 °C for 6
h to eliminate impurities and residual NMP, rinsed with distilled
water, and dried at room temperature overnight. Finally, RCMs were
annealed at different temperatures 140, 170, and 200 °C for 1
h in a vacuum oven.

4.3 Characterization of PFSA
membranes
4.3.1 Proton Conductivity
Proton conductivity
(σ) was measured using a four-electrode conductivity
cell (MCC, WonAtech, South Korea) equipped with a Solartron 1260 impedance/gain-phase
analyzer and a Solartron 1287 electrochemical interface. The conductivity
in a fully swollen state in water was determined at 25 °C in
distilled water. Meanwhile, RH-dependent conductivity was measured
at 80 °C with 30, 50, 70, 90, and 100% RHs. 1  where D is the distance between
electrodes, L is the membrane width, T is the membrane thickness, and R is the ohmic resistance
obtained from an impedance plot in the frequency range of 10–1–105 Hz.

4.3.2 Water
Uptake and Swelling Ratio
For water uptake and swelling ratio
measurements, samples with dimensions
of 2 × 2 cm2 were vacuum-oven-dried at 100 °C
for 24 h and immediately weighed on an analytical balance (EM 120-HR,
PRECISA, Switzerland) at 100 °C. The sample size and thickness
were checked using vernier calipers and a micrometer (Mitutoyo, CD-15CPX,
Japan), respectively. To achieve the fully water-absorbed state, samples
were soaked in distilled water at room temperature for 1 day. Excess
water on the sample surface was gently removed by a paper tissue,
and sample weight, size, and thickness were remeasured. Water uptake
was calculated by eq 2, where Wwet and Wdry represent the
wet and dry membrane weights, respectively. In-plane and through-plane
swelling ratios were calculated by eqs 3 and 4, respectively. In these equations, Awet and Adry stand for wet
and dry areas, respectively, and Twet and Tdry are wet and dry thicknesses, respectively. 2   3   4  

4.3.3 IEC
IEC change of membrane upon
annealing was measured by back titration. The membrane samples were
soaked into an excess of a 5 M NaCl solution for 24 h, and then HCl
coming out from the membrane by ion exchange was titrated with 0.01
N NaOH using a titrator (Metrohm 848 Titrino Plus, Swiss), and IEC
was determined by eq 5. 5  where VNaOH and CNaOH are the consumed volume and
concentration
of NaOH, respectively.

4.3.4 Fourier Transform Infrared
(FT-IR) Spectroscopy
Analysis
Annealing-induced changes of membrane chemical structure
were investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy (NICOLET 5700 FT-IR) in attenuated
total reflectance mode (Smart MIRacle accessory, Diamond, PIKE technologies).
Prior to analysis, membrane samples were dried overnight in a desiccator
at room temperature. Spectra were recorded at a resolution of 4 cm–1 in the range of 700–4000 cm–1 and normalized with respect to the highest-absorbance peak of CF2, which is a major unit of the PTFE backbone, to investigate
the variation of peak intensity for two ethers in the side chain.

4.3.5 SAXS Measurements
The nanostructure
of PFSA membranes was analyzed by SAXS. The corresponding instrument
(SAXSpace, Anton Paar, Austria) was operated by focusing a line-shaped
beam of Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) onto the detector
plane. The high-resolution mode was chosen to detect a minimum scattering
vector, qmin, of 0.03 nm–1 (q = (4π/λ)sin θ,
where 2θ is the scattering angle). The prepared samples, stored
in a vacuum desiccator overnight before the experiment, were fixed
with a beam adjustment slit at the spring holder and placed into a
chamber with a vacuum of 1.9–2.0 mbar. The scattering wave
vector (q) and intensity curve were depicted using
a one-dimensional intensity profile produced by azimuthal integration
of the collected two-dimensional scattering patterns. The d-spacing of the hydrophilic domain was calculated using
Bragg’s law (eq 6). 6  

4.3.6 DMA
The mechanical properties of
solution-cast membranes were probed by DMA (Q800, TA Instruments)
for specimens dried overnight in a desiccator at room temperature.
Membrane samples with dimensions of 15 × 15 mm2 and
a thickness of 50 μm were tested in multi-frequency strain mode
at a constant frequency of 10 Hz using an initial static force of
0.05 N, a force track of 125.0%, and an oscillation amplitude of 10
μm. Temperature sweeping was conducted in the range of 25–225
°C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The collected stress–temperature
data were used to plot graphs of storage modulus, loss modulus, and
tan δ, and thus determine Tg.

4.3.7 Solvent Resistance Test
The stability
of reinforced PFSA membranes was evaluated by a solvent resistance
test. Membrane samples (2 × 2 cm2) were dried in a
vacuum oven at 70 °C overnight and immersed in ethanol for 3
days. The change of membrane thickness was checked by a micrometer,
and cross-sectional morphology was investigated by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM; Hitachi SEM S-4800, Japan).

4.4 OCV Combined Wet–Dry Cycling Test
A 9 cm2 MEA was fabricated by a decal transfer method
with an anode/cathode Pt loading of 0.25–0.30 mgPt/cm2.52 Carbon-supported Pt
(TEC10F50E, Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K. K., Japan) and an Aquivion ionomer
(D83-24B) were used as the metal catalyst and binder for the electrode
layer, respectively. OCV combined wet–dry cycling was performed
using the protocol proposed by the U.S. DOE.58

Testing was performed at 90 °C and 0–100% RH with
40 sccm/cm2 H2 and high-purity air supplied
to the anode and cathode, respectively. The OCV was continuously monitored
by a potentiostat (ZIVE SP2, WonATech, Korea). In the wet–dry
cycle test, the cell was tested at 90 °C for 30 s dry (0%)/45
s wet (100%) conditions as one cycle (denoted as 30/45 s). High-frequency
resistance (HFR) was measured at 90 °C and 100% RH using a potentiostat
(HCP-803, Bio-Logic Science Instruments, France) at 1–20 000
Hz every 1000 cycles until 10 000 cycles and subsequently every
2000 cycles. Cycling was terminated when the OCV dropped to less than
80% of the initial value.
