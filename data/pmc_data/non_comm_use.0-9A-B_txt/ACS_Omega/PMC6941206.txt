Enyne metathesis (EM) has extensively been used to prepare
diverse
polycycles and heterocycles. EM in combination with Diels–Alder
(DA) reaction has been used to prepare densely functionalized targets
in a simple manner. In this mini-review, we discuss the various diversity-oriented
approaches reported from our laboratory to prepare a variety of organic
frameworks by a synergistic combination of EM and DA reactions. Some
of the end products are useful intermediates for the synthesis of
complex organic targets.

==== Body
Introduction
Enyne metathesis (EM)1 is a bond reorganization
process between alkynes and alkenes to produce conjugated 1,3-dienes
(Scheme 1). It involves
the simultaneous bond cleavage and bond formation. This reaction is
generally catalyzed by a ruthenium catalyst, Grubbs’ first-generation
precatalyst (G-I), Grubbs’ second-generation precatalyst (G-II),
and Hoveyda–Grubbs’ precatalysts (HG-I and HG-II) etc.
(Figure 1). The intermolecular
process is called a cross-enyne metathesis (CEM, Scheme 1), whereas the intramolecular
reactions are referred to as ring-closing enyne metathesis (RCEM, Scheme 1). EM is a very expedient
tool to generate a 1,3-diene moiety, which is a strategic component
in the DA reaction to generate diverse polycyclic compounds.2 A large number of compounds containing a six-membered
ring can be generated by utilizing the EM–DA approach. The
designed approach is diversity-oriented, as a combinatorial library
of target compounds could be assembled by varying the diene and the
dienophile component in a DA reaction. The final six-membered ring
compounds are the core structure of various biologically relevant
drug-like molecules and structural analogues of bioactive natural
products.3 More specifically, cross-metathesis
(CM) and RCEM provide an easy access to generate various dienes containing
polar functional groups. The generation of such intricate dienes is
a difficult task by conventional methods.

Scheme 1 Intermolecular and
Intramolecular Enyne Metathesis
Figure 1 Precatalysts used for the metathesis.

In 1985, Katz and Sivavec first reported the intramolecular
RCEM
with a tungsten carbene complex, where the diene 7 was
generated from the enyne 6 by treating with a catalytic
amount of tungsten carbene complex (Scheme 2).4a Later, in
1994, Mori and Kinoshita reported the first example of intramolecular
enyne metathesis catalyzed by Grubbs’ catalyst, where the enyne
building block 8 was treated with a ruthenium catalyst
to generate the cyclic diene 9 (Scheme 3).4b

Complex
Here, we summarize our efforts to prepare various
diene building
blocks via EM and their subsequent utilization in the synthesis of
highly functionalized and intricate carbocyclic and heterocyclic frameworks.
More specifically, the EM and DA sequence has been used to prepare
various modified amino acid derivatives, polycycles, macroheterocycles,
heterocycles, crownophanes, diphenylalkane derivatives, and spirocycles.
Some of these building blocks were further incorporated into small
peptides, thus generating a library of modified peptides. We have
grouped the EM–DA reaction strategies based on the class of
the final product, i.e., polycycles, heterocycles, amino acid derivatives,
crownophanes, spirocycles, etc. As and when necessary, we have included
others references also.

1 Indane-Based α-Amino Acid Derivatives
and Natural Products
The Buchrer–Burg method is generally
employed to generate indanyl glycine; however, this methodology is
impractical for sensitive substrates due to the harsh conditions employed
during the hydrolysis of hydantions. Therefore, a conceptually new
approach by using EM and DA reaction in synergistic combination was
utilized to assemble indanyl glycine derivatives (Scheme 4).5a,5b In this regard, O’Donnell Schiff base 10 was
subjected to a propargylation, allylation, hydrolysis, and acetylation
reaction sequence to generate the enyne building block 11.5c Later, enyne 11 was subjected
to EM to generate the key inner–outer ring diene building block 12, which on DA reaction with various dienophiles and subsequent
dehydrogenation with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ)
delivered the indanyl glycine derivatives 13a,b and 14–15. The present strategy
provides a “green route” to indanyl glycine derivatives
as both EM and DA are atom-economic reactions. Later, this strategy
has been used to generate various molecular frameworks.6

Scheme 4 Indanyl Glycine Derivatives
In 2011, Reddy’s group reported a first
total synthesis
of bicyclic diterpene, isofregenedadiol 19, by utilizing
a one-pot reaction sequence involving RCEM, CM, DA reaction, and aromatization
(Scheme 5).7 Later in 2014, Reddy and co-workers used a similar
strategy to report the first total synthesis of a norsesquiterpene
alkaloid, (R)-8-hydroxy-4,7,7-trimethyl-7,8-dihydrocyclopenta[e]isoindole-1,3(2H,6H)-dione 23. The synthetic strategy involves a RCEM, DA reaction, and
aromatization sequence to generate the desired indane skeleton present
in the natural product. The resulting indane-based diester 21 was transformed into a target anticancer agent by hydrolysis, conversion
of diacid to imide 22, and subsequent removal of the
benzyl group to deliver the compound 23 (Scheme 6).8

Scheme 5 Total Synthesis of Isofregenedadiol by EM–DA Strategy
Scheme 6 Total Synthesis of a Norsesquiterpene Alkaloid by
EM–DA Strategy
Recently, Kaliappan and Sayyad have reported
the synthesis of a
new class of sugar–oxasteroid–quinone hybrid molecules 26 via sequential EM–DA strategy (Scheme 7).9 By utilizing this approach with various enyne-containing sugar molecules,
they have prepared a library of hybrid molecules with a steroid-like
backbone.

Scheme 7 Sugar–Oxasteroid–Quinone Hybrid Molecules
via EM–DA
Strategy
2 Tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic Acid (Tic)
Derivatives
Later, the above strategy involving EM–DA
reactions has been extended for the synthesis of topographically constrained
Tic derivatives 29–30 (Tic, a constrained
analogue of Phenylalanine (Phe), Scheme 8).10a

Scheme 8 Constrained
Tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic Acid (Tic) Derivatives
Tic derivatives are conventionally prepared
by Pictet–Spengler
or Bischler–Napieralski reactions, which start with the preformed
benzene derivatives. Moreover, these methods are not suitable for
substrates containing electron-withdrawing groups due to the involvement
of electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. To realize the EM–DA
strategy, the required enyne building block 27 was prepared
from Schiff base ester 10 via C-allylation and hydrolysis
reaction followed by the N-protection and N-propargylation. Later,
EM of building block 27 using the G–I catalyst
gave the required inner–outer ring diene building blocks 28. Finally, the DA reaction of the dienes 28 with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) and quinone, followed
by subsequent oxidation of the DA adducts, generated the Tic derivatives 29 and 30, respectively, in good yields. The
present methodology quickly improves the diversity and molecular complexity
and provides access to intricate Tic derivatives.

Further, the
above methodology has been extended to the synthesis
of a highly substituted seven-membered analogue of Tic 34 (Scheme 9).10b In this context, initially the amide nitrogen
in the compound 31 was N-alkylated with butenyl bromide,
and then the compound 32 was subjected to EM to generate
the diene 33, which on DA reaction with DMAD followed
by oxidation using DDQ delivered the desired analogue of Tic 34. The present strategy is advantageous over the existing
methods, as diverse substituents in the benzene ring can be incorporated
by the careful selection of reacting partners.

Scheme 9 Seven-Membered Analogue
of Tic Derivatives
3 Modified Phenylalanine-Based α-Amino Acids
and Peptides
The strategy involving CEM and DA reaction as
key steps was further utilized for the synthesis of highly functionalized
Phe derivatives (Scheme 10).10c,10d The beauty of this strategy
is that Phe-based α-amino acid (AAA) derivatives are assembled
from building blocks having no Phe moiety. To this end, the acetylenic
building blocks 36 were prepared from the Schiff base 10 or 35, and later it was reacted with allyl
acetate, a functionalized ethylene derivative to deliver the diene 37 as a mixture of isomers (1:1). No attempts were made to
separate these isomers as the stereochemistry of the diene 37 is of no consequence for the synthesis of final Phe derivatives.
The DA reaction of 37 with DMAD and subsequent oxidation
of the DA adducts delivered the highly functionalized Phe derivatives 38. It is worthy to mention that the diene 37 could not be synthesized from CEM of alkynes and the allyl building
blocks containing an AAA moiety.

Scheme 10 Synthesis of Functionalized Phenylalanine
(Phe) Derivatives
In another instance, the Schiff base 10 was subjected
to a C-propargylation, hydrolysis, and protection sequence to generate
the alkyne building block 31. Later, CEM of the alkyne
building block 31 with ethylene as a cross-coupling partner
gave the diene 39. Then, treatment of the diene 39 with various dienophiles and subsequent aromatization of
the DA adduct delivered a highly functionalized Phe derivative 40 (Scheme 11).11 Further, the alkylation of ethyl
isocyanoacetate (EICA) with 2-bromomethyl-1,3-butadiene 41 or sulfolene bromide 42 failed to deliver the diene 39 (Scheme 11).10c−10e In another report, the analogue of diene
was prepared by using N-acyliminium ion chemistry.12a

Scheme 11 Highly Functionalized Phe Derivative
A similar diene containing the AAA derivative 46 was
reported by Baldwin and co-workers using Denmark’s coupling
reaction (Scheme 12).12b

Scheme 12 Generation of a Diene-Containing
Amino Acid Moiety
In another attempt, dicarba analogues of cystine
derivatives such
as 51 were prepared by using a CEM and DA approach (Scheme 13).11

Scheme 13 Dicarba Analogues of Cystine Derivatives
The benzophenone imine glycine ester 10 was reacted
with 1,4-dibromo-2-butyne (48), followed by hydrolysis,
and acetylation gave the alkyne derivative 49 (two diastereomers
in 1:1 ratio; RR/SS, and RS/SR). The bis(amino acid) derivative 49 was subjected to CEM in the presence of ethylene and HG-II
catalyst to afford the desired diene 50. Finally, the
DA reaction of diene 50 with various dienophiles gave
the conformationally rigid dicarba analogues of cysteine 51.

Further, the above strategy was extended toward the postassembly
peptide modification.13a To realize the
synthetic strategy, the alkyne-based dipeptide 52 was
synthesized from diethyl acetamidomalonate (DEAM) (43). To the end, CEM of alkyne 52 with ethylene as a cross-coupling
partner delivered the diene 53, which on treatment with
DMAD followed by aromatization with MnO2 generated the
desired modified Phe-based dipeptide 54 (Scheme 14). In addition, the same strategy
was extended to tripeptide-based alkyne building block 55, and the DA reaction was also realized with 1,4-napthaquinone to
establish the diversity of this approach (Scheme 15).

Scheme 14 Phe-Based Dipeptide
Scheme 15 Phe-Based Tripeptide
4 Crownophane
Recently, we reported a
diversity-oriented approach to crownophanes by utilizing CEM and DA
reactions as key steps (Scheme 16).13b Initially, the diene 59 was generated by CEM of alkyne precursor 58 in the presence of Grubb’s catalyst under an ethylene atmosphere.
Later, the DA reaction of the diene 59 with DMAD followed
by aromatization of the cycloadduct with DDQ gave the crownophane 60. It is worth noting that the present strategy involved
the creation of eight new C–C bonds and thereby accomplishing
step economy and atom economy. The above strategy was further employed
to assemble ortho- and meta-crownophanes.

Scheme 16 Paracrownophanes via EM–DA Strategy
Later, another derivative of crownophane 63 was assembled
by utilization of the above strategy (Scheme 17).13b In this
regard, the crownophane-based acetylenic derivative 61 was subjected to CEM under an ethylene atmosphere to generate the
diene 62. Then, the DA reaction of diene 62 with DMAD followed by aromatization of the cycloadduct gave the
desired crownophane 63. Similarly, this strategy was
extended to ortho- and meta-crownophanes.

Scheme 17 Crownophane via EM–DA Strategy
5 Diphenylalkane Derivatives
In 2009,
a useful strategy has been realized to highly functionalized diphenylalkane
derivatives via atom-economical processes such as [2 + 2 + 2] cyclotrimerization,
CEM, and DA reaction as key steps (Scheme 18).13c

Scheme 18 Functionalized
Diphenylalkane Derivatives
To this end, the alkyne building blocks 66 were prepared
by the [2 + 2 + 2] cyclotrimerization of dialkyne 64 and
DMAD in the presence of Wilkinson’s catalyst [Rh(PPh3)3Cl]. Later, the CEM of the alkyne 66 in
the presence of G-II catalyst under an ethylene atmosphere delivered
the dienes 67, which on DA reaction with DMAD followed
by aromatization gave the highly functionalized diphenylalkane derivatives 68. The beauty of the present strategy is that we accomplished
desymmetrization in highly symmetrical starting materials, i.e., α,ω-diynes.

In another event, we have demonstrated that CEM of phenylacetylene
derivatives with 1,5-hexadiene or ethylene followed by the DA reaction
and aromatization sequence delivered biaryl derivatives (Scheme 19 and Scheme 20).14 To realize the synthetic design, phenyl acetylenes 69 were subjected to CEM in the presence of G-II catalyst
under an ethylene atmosphere to generate the corresponding dienes 70. Later, the DA reaction of the dienes 70 with
DMAD followed by aromatization with DDQ gave biphenyl derivatives 71. The halogen substituent present in the biaryl derivative
is a useful handle to the Suzuki–Miyaura (SM) cross-coupling
reaction15 to generate the terphenyl derivative.
The present strategy can provide an easy access to a library of biaryl
(or terphenyl) building blocks via Suzuki coupling by using a variety
of commercially available boronic acids.

Scheme 19 Biaryl Derivatives
via EM–DA Strategy
Scheme 20 Homoallyl Derivatives via EM–DA Strategy
Similarly, the phenylacetylene 69 was subjected to
CEM with 1,5-hexadiene to generate the desired homoallyl diene derivatives 72 along with the benzoannulated product 73 (Scheme 20).14 The DA reaction of dienes 72 with DMAD gave
the DA adduct, which on aromatization with DDQ generated the biphenyl
derivatives 74. Later, this strategy has been extended
toward the synthesis of amino acid derivatives 74a and 74b.16

6 Spirocycles
In 2007, we reported a
unique example involving sequential RCM and CEM.17 Three products (76–78)
were isolated when the enyne precursor 75 was treated
with G-I in the presence of ethylene (Scheme 21). On the contrary, two products 79 and 80 were isolated when the enyne precursor 75 was treated with G-II in dichloromethane (DCM) at room
temperature. The compound 79 has been derived by EM at
one alkyne end and compound 80, due to EM at both alkyne
ends. When the compound 75 was treated with the G-II
catalyst under ethylene-free reaction conditions, no metathesis product
was observed, but the G-I catalyst with in situ generated
ethylene reacted with alkyne moieties. In this strategy, chemoselectivity
was observed with G-I and G-II catalysts under an ethylene atmosphere.
The reactions of enyne precursor 75 under G-I, G-II,
and HG-II catalyst conditions failed to give the bis-spirocyclic diene 81 (Scheme 22).

Scheme 21 Sequential RCM and CEM
Scheme 22 Attempt to Bis-spirocyclic Diene
Recently, a simple diversity-oriented methodology
for the synthesis
of indane-based spirocycles has been developed via EM and DA reaction,
as key steps (Scheme 23).18a The enyne building block 82 was assembled by monopropargylation followed by allylation of the
indane-1,3-dione. Later, the enyne building block 82 was
subjected to ring-closing enyne metathesis in the presence of G-II
catalyst. A catalytic amount of titanium isopropoxide and ethylene
atmosphere was found to increase the yield of 83. The
diene 83 was treated with various dienophiles to produce
the corresponding DA adducts. Then, the DA adducts were subjected
to oxidation with MnO2 to deliver the corresponding aromatized
spirocycles 84. This work has been highlighted in Synfacts.18b

Scheme 23 Indane-Based Spirocycles
Dienophile: 1,4-benzoquinone
(57%), 1,4-naphthoquinone (49%), 1,4-anthraquinone (55%), DMAD (76%), N-phenylmaleimide (65%).

The above
strategy was expanded to generate diverse spirocycles 88 by varying the active methylene compound (AMC), such as
indane-1-one, 1-tetralone, 6-methoxy-1-tetralone, and diethyl malonate
(Scheme 24).18c A variety of enyne building blocks 86 were prepared by the sequential allylation followed by propargylation
of the corresponding active methylene compound 85. Later,
the enyne building blocks were treated with G-II catalyst under an
ethylene atmosphere in the presence of titanium tetraisopropoxide
to generate dienes 87. These dienes were further utilized
to generate a library of angularly fused spirocyclic compounds 88 by reacting with a variety of dienophiles such as DMAD,
tetracyanoethylene, 1,4-benzoquinone, 1,4-naphthoquinone, 1,4-anthraquinone,
4-phenyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione, and N-phenylmaleimide.

Scheme 24 Diverse Spirocycles
7 Heterocycles
The strategy involving
the EM–DA reaction was utilized by Dixneuf and co-workers for
the synthesis of cyclic siloxanes 92 (Scheme 25).19 They have reported the intramolecular metathesis of enynes 89 containing the Si–O linkage with ruthenium-based
three-component catalytic systems to generate the dienes 90. The resulting six-membered siloxane dienes 90 were
utilized in DA reaction followed by aromatization of the resulting
DA adduct 91, generating the aromatic compound 92 which is an important precursor for sol–gel materials
and fine chemicals.

Scheme 25 Synthesis of Cyclic Siloxanes via EM–DA
Reaction
Similarly, Majumdar and co-workers have applied
the EM–DA
strategy to generate tricyclic oxepin-annulated pyrone derivatives 95 (Scheme 26).20 In this regard, the pyrone-based
enyne derivatives 93 were subjected to RCEM to produce
oxepin-annulated pyrone-based diene derivatives 94. These
dienes 94 on DA reaction with dimethyl fumarate gave
tricyclic oxepin-annulated pyrone derivatives 95 stereoselectively.

Scheme 26 Synthesis of Tricyclic Oxepin-Annulated Pyrone Derivatives
Kotha’s group has successfully utilized
the EM and DA reaction
strategy for the generation of heterocycles. In this regard, the required
enyne building blocks 98 were prepared from the β-naphthols 96 by O-allylation followed by Claisen rearrangement (CR)
and subsequent O-propargylation of 97. Later, these enynes 98 were successfully transformed into the required diene 99 by G-II catalyst. These dienes on DA reaction with various
dienophiles generated the polycyclic frameworks such as 100 (Scheme 27).21

Scheme 27 Polycyclic Frameworks via EM–DA
Strategy
In 2007, tandem cross-enyne ring-closing metathesis
(CE-RCM) was
explored to generate densely functionalized macroheterocycles (Scheme 28).22a To realize the synthetic sequence, N-tosyl glycine 101 was subjected to esterification
with propargyl bromide to yield the ester 102. The O-propargylated
compound 102 was then allylated using allyl bromide to
deliver the enyne precursor 103. Later, enyne 103 was subjected to CE-RCM with 1,5-hexadiene to deliver the desired
12-membered macrocyclic compound 104 along with an open-chain
product 105. Further, the strategy was extended to generate
macrocyclic systems of 13–16-membered ring size (107) by varying the size of alkenylation partner.

Scheme 28 Functionalized Macroheterocycles
The above methodology was utilized to assemble C-α,α-functionalized macrocyclic AAA derivative 111 (Scheme 29).22b In this regard, a suitable enyne
precursor 110 was synthesized from DEAM (43) in three steps. To begin with, DEAM was partially hydrolyzed and
subjected to O-propargylation to deliver the ester 109, which was then subjected to C-allylation with allyl bromide to
generate the required enyne precursor 110. Later, treatment
of the enyne 110 with 1,5-hexadiene in the presence of
a Grubb’s catalyst delivered the desired 12-membered macrocyclic
AAA derivative 111 in 40% yield, along with the open-chain
compound 112 in 54% yield. Systematic catalyst screening
resulted in the selective formation of the desired macrocyclic AAA
derivative, and with the HG-I catalyst, the cyclic AAA derivative 111 was obtained in 86% yield.

Scheme 29 Macrocyclic AAA
Derivative
In 2015, Fustero’s group has reported
a tandem CEM and intramolecular
DA reaction methodology for the generation of linear bicyclic ketone,
lactone, and lactam scaffolds in a simple manner with good diastereoselectivity
(Scheme 30).23 In this regard, various conjugated ketones,
esters, and amides bearing an alkene moiety 113 were
reacted with different aromatic alkynes 114 in the presence
of HG-II catalyst to obtain the bicyclic ketone, lactones, and lactams 115. The resulting bicyclic heterocycles 115 were
formed via tandem CEM and an intramolecular DA reaction sequence.

Scheme 30 Bicyclic Scaffolds via EM–DA Strategy
In 2014, Kotha’s group has developed
a diversity-oriented
approach to fused oxacycles 119 by using the enyne ring-rearrangement
metathesis (ERRM) and DA reaction as key steps starting with a suitable
propargylated derivative 117. The propargylated derivative 117 was derived from 1β-dicyclopentadienol 116. Then, ERRM of 117 in the presence of ethylene and
G-I catalyst delivered the rearranged tricyclic diene 118, which on treatment with various dienophiles generated the cycloadducts
such as 119 (Scheme 31).24a

Scheme 31 Oxacycles via EM–DA
Strategy
Similarly, our group has developed a simple
synthetic strategy
to construct the oxa-bowls containing dienes by utilizing ERRM as
a key step (Scheme 32).24b In this regard, the required norbornene
derivatives 121 were prepared by DA reaction of cyclopentadiene
and quinone followed by the reduction of DA adduct 120. Then the diol 121 was subjected to O-propargylation
using propargyl bromide to generate the dipropargylated norbornenes 122, which were subsequently converted to dienes 123 by ERRM. These dienes 123 can be further utilized for
creating the polycycles by DA strategy, but these dienes are found
to be unstable under normal DA reaction conditions.

Scheme 32 Enyne
Ring-Rearrangement Metathesis (ERRM)
The ERRM strategy was extended toward the synthesis
of oxa-bowl-based
polycyclic compound 128. In this regard, tricyclic enone 124 was reduced to tricyclic diol 125, which
was O-propargylated using propargyl bromide to generate an enyne building
block 126. The ERRM of enyne building block 126 in the presence of a G-I catalyst gave the oxa-bowls containing
diene 127. Later, the DA reaction of the diene 127 with N-phenylmaleimide generated the
polycyclic compound 128 (Scheme 33). By varying the dienophile moiety, one
can prepare a library of polycyclic compounds.

Scheme 33 Oxa-Bowl-Based Polycycle
Along similar lines, a structurally intricate
polycyclic compound 132 has been synthesized through
ruthenium-catalyzed ring-rearrangement
metathesis (RRM) of norbornene derivatives (Scheme 34 and Scheme 35).24c In this
aspect, the diol 129 was prepared from dione 120 by treating it with allylmagnesium bromide. Then, the treatment
of diol 129 with propargyl bromide generated the mono-O-propargyl derivative 130, which was subjected
to the RCEM–RRM sequence in the presence of HG-II catalyst
under an ethylene atmosphere to deliver the tetracyclic diene 131. When the compound 131a was reacted with
tetracyanoethylene (TCE) in refluxing toluene, the dehydrated product 132 was isolated, which is derived from the DA adduct (Scheme 35).

Scheme 34 Polycyclic
Diene through RCEM–RRM
Scheme 35 Synthesis of Structurally Intricate Polycyclic Compound 132
In 2017, a new synthetic strategy to fused nitrogen
containing
heterocycle 136 was demonstrated by using the ERRM–DA
protocol (Scheme 36).24d In this context, when the N-propargyl derivative 133 was treated with
a G-I catalyst in the presence of ethylene, a mixture of two products 134 and 135 was formed. The compound 134 was derived by ERRM and compound 135 by ring-opening
reaction. The ring-opened product 135 underwent EM in
the presence of ethylene and a G-I catalyst to deliver the desired
diene 134 in good yield. Later, the DA reaction of the
diene 134 with tetracyanoethylene (TCE) gave the cycloadduct 136. Interestingly, the pentacyclic compound 136 possesses the tricyclic core of the alkaloid, epimeloscine.

Scheme 36 ERRM–DA Protocol
8 Miscellaneous
We have also reported
the generation of dienes starting with protected, but-2-yne-1,4-diol
derivatives 137 by CEM under ethylene atmosphere (Scheme 37).25 The acyl-protected diene 138a is a suitable
starting material to assemble benzoannulated compound 139, which can be further utilized for the synthesis of polycyclic compounds
through a regioselective DA reaction of the benzosultine-sulfone building
block 140. The DA reaction of tosyl-protected diene 138b with various dienophiles under different conditions was
unsuccessful. However, the DA reaction of acetyl derivative 138a with DMAD gave the expected DA adduct. Later, the DA
adduct was subjected to aromatization using DDQ in benzene or MnO2 in dioxane under reflux conditions to generate the desired
benzoannulated product 139.

Scheme 37 Benzoannulation
via EM–DA Reaction
Summary and Outlook
In this account, we have summarized
various synthetic strategies
to prepare diverse diene building blocks via EM and their use in assembling
a variety of polycyclic compounds. The synergetic approach of the
EM and DA sequence has been utilized to prepare various unnatural
amino acid derivatives, modified peptides, polycycles, heterocycles,
and spirocyclic compounds. This synergetic approach can be employed
to prepare various biologically important molecules or chemical intermediates,
which may inspire the synthesis of pharmaceutically important compounds.
