Recently, Bi4V2O11 as an electrolyte
material has pulled in considerable consideration because of its remarkable
novel applications. In this article, novel, dysprosium-doped (x = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5) Bi4V2O11 (Dy/BVO) nanoparticles have been synthesized by sol–gel
strategy. The photocatalyst Dy/BVO nanoparticles exhibit higher photocatalytic
efficiency than BVO nanoparticles assessed by debasement of tetracycline
drug under visible light illumination. Our work focuses on the phase
transformation, conducting properties, and mechanisms of the Dy/BVO
nanoparticles in relation to execute some methods of processing and
manufacturing product in commercial applications. The characterization
of Dy/BVO was performed by Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction,
scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, and
UV–vis analysis. ac impedance spectroscopy was used to analyze
the conducting behavior of synthesized nanoparticles in the temperature
range 100–600 °C. The photocatalytic activity revealed
that Dy/BVO remarkably enhanced the photocatalytic activity. This
is the first report that Dy/BVO can destroy the drug effluent which
is coming from the drug industry and also worried about the human
health hazards.

1 Introduction
Antibiotics
are the world’s biggest creation and utilization
of medications, which play out an imperative part in the avoidance
and direction of the malady.1 Joined by
the ascent in the utilization of antibiotics, an extensive number
of them are released into the earth including pharmaceutical wastewater
and aquaculture wastewater year by year.2 The presence of pharmaceutical scums in wastewater has pulled in
overall consideration because of their ruinous effect on natural issues
and human wellbeing through drinking water and evolved way of life.3 Tetracycline (TC) drug is broadly utilized as
a part of different perspectives, for example, bacterial infection,4 horticulture,5 and
domesticated animal products.6 It is accounted
for that TC sedate is the beside the biggest utilized as a part of
the world, representing right around 33% of the anti-infection agents
creation and utilization.7,8 With the unnecessary
gathering of antibiotic agents in the human body,9 they can incite nephropathy, influence kidneys, and different
changes, for example, mutagenic and teratogenic impacts.5 The presence of TC drug in water conditions will
influence the structure and action of microorganisms, which subsequently
changes the natural structure of the microbial vegetation.3,10 In order to eliminate the residual antibiotics in ecological water,
the current innovation is primarily reliant on activated carbon adsorption,11 coagulation–flotation,12 ultrasound degradation, and membrane bioreactor.11 These strategies are still faced with the trouble
of quite a while devouring, vitality utilization, and poor effectiveness.
Without a doubt, there is a solid interest for a quick and reasonable
technique for the end of antibiotics from sullied water. Among them,
photocatalytic degradation is considered as a supportable innovation
to evacuate TC drug and the photocatalytic degradation proficiency
of TC drug is high.

Bismuth-based oxides, for example, bismuth
vanadate (BVO), have
pulled in an enormous amount of consideration because of their magnificent
properties, for example, protection from corrosion,13 nontoxic, ferro elasticity,14 and ionic conductivity.15 However, the
photocatalytic activity of the pure BVO still needs improvement because
of its low quantum yield and poor adsorptive execution. This low performance
of BVO nanoparticles is due to the difficult passage of photogenerated
electron–hole pairs.14,16 To resolve this problem,
doping of metal ion can improve the photocatalytic activity of BVO
through separating the photogenerated electrons from holes.17 Recently, there have been few reports on the
advancement of doped BVO to enhance the photocatalytic activity under
visible light irradiation.18 In this way,
it was thought beneficial to enhance the photocatalytic activity of
BVO and the photosensitivity toward visible light utilizing doping
agent, for example, Ag,15 Cu,14 and C,19 which have
attracted much attention.

Here, in the present study, BVO and
dysprosium-doped Bi4V2O11 (Dy/BVO)
nanoparticles were synthesized
by the sol–gel technique. The photocatalytic activity of the
BVO and Dy/BVO nanoparticles was assessed by the degradation of TC
drug under visible light irradiation, and the outcome demonstrated
that the Dy/BVO nanoparticles show exceptionally improved photocatalytic
activity compared to the BVO nanoparticles.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Materials
All chemicals are used
without further purification. The distilled water was used for the
whole experimental procedures.

2.2 Synthesis
of BVO and Dy/BVO
In the
typical synthesis procedure, 1 mol Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, 1 mol V2O5, and required amount of
Dy(NO3)3·xH2O were dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water, followed by the addition
of citric acid in the molar ratio unity. Under constant stirring,
ammonia (NH3) solution was added to maintain the neutrality
of the sol. The solution is continuously stirred for few hours while
maintaining the temperature of the solution to 60 °C. After a
few hours, the color of the solution changes and xerogel is formed.
This xerogel is kept at 90 °C. At this temperature, the gel is
dried in a self-propagating combustion manner and finally transformed
into loose powder. This powder is finally annealed at 600 °C
in the open air furnace after grinding.

2.3 Characterization
Techniques
A Rigaku
Ultima VI X-ray diffractometer with a radiation source of Cu Kα
(λ = 1.54 Å) was used to record the X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns.12,20 A Carl Zeiss EVO-50 series scanning electron
microscope was used to record scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
of BVO and Dy/BVO nanoparticles. The optical properties of the nanoparticles
were investigated by a UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (PerkinElmer,
LAMBDA 1050) spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere.21 Electrical properties were investigated by ac
impedance spectroscopy (Wayne Kerr 4100 LCR meter) operated in the
frequency range 1 Hz to 1 MHz.22 Impedance
spectra were subjected to non-linear least-squares fitting using Zview
software program.

2.4 Photocatalytic Activity
The application
of the BVO and Dy/BVO (x = 0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and
0.5%) nanoparticles to degradation of TC antibiotic drug was evaluated
under visible light by using 300 W Xe lamp illumination.23 In this process, 100 mg of photocatalyst powder
was disseminated in 100 mL of the aqueous solution of TC drug with
an underlying centralization of 10 mg/L. Before visible light illumination,
the subsequent suspension was ultrasonically treated for 15 min and
after that stirred in the dark for 1 h to permit the system to establish
the adsorption–desorption equilibrium. At given irradiation
intervals, 4 mL of the suspension was gathered at specific interims,
at that point centrifuged to evacuate the photocatalyst particles,
last the solution was separated through a 0.22 μm nylon 66 membrane
filter. The filtrate was investigated by recording the maximal absorption
of various wavelengths in the UV–vis spectrophotometer.

A control (blank) test was additionally led for the TC solution without
Dy/BVO nanoparticles under visible light illumination.

The rate
of photodegradation of the photocatalyst can be considered
in the accompanying way24 1  where Co is the
concentration of TC drug at adsorption equilibrium and C is the residual concentration of TC drug at different illumination
intervals.

The kinetics of photodegradation of TC drug can be
articulated
as follows25 2  where k (min–1) is the degradation rate constant.

3 Results and Discussion
The influence of substitution
of Dy3+ on polymorphism
of BVO is shown by XRD patterns at room temperature in Figure 1a. The XRD pattern of BVO shows
the stabilization of monoclinic α phase which is confirmed by
JCPDS number 82-1481 with a space group symmetry C2/m. For 2%, Dy/BVO nanoparticles show a characteristic
doublet peak which is observed between 2θ = 46°–46.5°
ascribed to (026) and (606) which gives the confirmation of monoclinic
α phase. The doublet peak is merged into singlet (220) for 3%
Dy/BVO, showing the existence of orthorhombic β-phase. The small
peaks (indicated with an asterisk) show the presence of Dy3+ incorporated in the BVO lattice. These small peaks were not observed
in the pure BVO nanoparticles. Tetragonal γ phase is confirmed
(JCPDS number 89-0102) for the 4% Dy/BVO and 5% Dy/BVO nanoparticles
at room temperature with a space group symmetry I4/mmm. The (200) peaks at 2θ ≈ 31°
show the decrement in the sharpness. It is may be because of the incorporation
of larger size cation Dy3+ (0.912A°) in place of smaller
cation vanadium (V5+ = 0.68A°). Because of this incorporation,
the structure of BVO nanoparticles gets disturbed and adapted into
more stable phase. Table 1 summarizes the unit cell parameters of various compositions.
It is worth mentioning that the unit cell parameters were refined
in the mean orthorhombic system, using the space groups, C2/m, Aba2, and I4/mmm for α, β, and γ phases,
respectively. It can be noted that the c-parameter
generally increases with increasing Dy3+ concentration.
The average crystallite size of synthesized nanoparticles can be calculated
by Debye Scherrer formula,25a,26,27,27b and it is near about 80–90
nm.

graph of BVO and Dy-doped BVO nanoparticles.

The thermal phase stability of the BVO and Dy/BVO
nanoparticles
was investigated by differential thermal analysis (DTA) (Figure 1b). On heating, nanoparticles
show small double endothermic peaks at 335 and 449 °C for BVO
and 2% Dy/BVO nanoparticles, respectively, which are assigned to the
α phase, whereas the smaller one single endothermic peak (431
°C) observed in 3% Dy/BVO nanoparticles which are attributed
to the α → β transition. The small endothermic
event is associated with oxygen vacancies’ order-disorder phase
transition which is found in other members of BIMEVOX. The 4% Dy/BVO
and 5% Dy/BVO nanoparticles show order → disorder, γ′
→ γ transition. These transitions are associated with
a subtle change that occurs in some oxygen sub lattice positions located
in the perovskite-vanadate polyhedral. This assignment is in a good
agreement with the results obtained from the XRD analysis.

The
morphology of the nanoparticles was analyzed by SEM analysis
(Figure 2). Micrographs
of BVO and 5% Dy/BVO nanoparticles show the dense morphology with
good homogeneity. It is clearly seen in the micrographs that the particles
are nonagglomerated and few partially aggregated. The elemental analysis
of the nanoparticles was analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis
(EDAX) (Figure 2c,d).
The compositions of nanoparticles were confirmed by the inset of the
EDAX spectrum. There is no impurity seen in the EDAX spectrum. It
is clearly seen in the inset of EDAX that the content of vanadium
decreases as the dysprosium doping increases.

and (b) 5% Dy/BVO nanoparticles; EDAX analysis
of (c) BVO and (d) 5% Dy/BVO nanoparticles.

The specific surface area and band gap energy of the nanoparticles
are shown in Figure 3. The specific surface area of BVO increases on doping with Dy because
of the difference in the ionic radii of the dopant and vanadium.28 Among BVO nanoparticles and Dy/BVO nanoparticles,
the BVO has the lowest Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
surface area, whereas doped material 5% Dy/BVO nanoparticles have
the highest BET surface area. It is broadly assumed that the catalytic
property is mainly determined by the adsorption and desorption of
molecules on the surface of the catalyst. The high specific surface
area can provide more reactive adsorption–desorption sites
for photocatalytic reaction.28 The energy
band gap of BVO and Dy/BVO nanoparticles is shown in Figure 3. A slightly lower value of
band gap was observed after doping with Dy. The red shift indicated
narrowing of the band gap of Dy/BVO nanoparticles which may originate
from the charge transfer between the BVO and Dy/BVO valence or conduction
band and the Dy ions.

Figure 3 Band gap energy and surface area of BVO and Dy/BVO nanoparticles.

The ac impedance measurements
for Dy/BVO (x =
0.0, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40, and 0.50%) nanoparticles are shown in Figure 4. The temperature
range between 100 and 600 °C. The single substitution in BVO
lattice results in various impedance regimes. As shown in Figure 4, two depressed semicircles
at low concentration of Dy3+ (3% Dy/BVO) indicate the grain
and grain boundary resistances, whereas at higher concentrations of
Dy3+, 4% Dy/BVO and 5% Dy/BVO nanoparticles can be attributed
to the combination of both grain and grain boundary. The inclined
spike appears at low-frequency regions in all of the compositions.
This is due to the electrode–electrolyte interface.29

Figure 4 Nyquist plots for BVO and Dy/BVO nanoparticles.

The impedance spectra and grain
bulk/boundary contribution have
been evaluated by two parallel R-CPE elements connected in series
with electrolyte resistance shown in Figure 4.

Table 2 represents
the values of equivalent circuit parameters for both grain and grain
boundary contribution estimated from the impedance plane plots for
temperature 300 °C at four different concentrations (x = 0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5). It can be found that the
grain contribution to the oxygen-ionic conductivity is more pronounced
than that of the grain boundary contribution because the values of Rg are higher than Rgb. It can also be noticed that the reduction in Rg values is faster than Rgb with increasing temperature. Moreover, the values of Cgb are higher than that of Cg which suggests that the permittivity increases with the accumulation
of charge carriers at the grain boundary. The highest values of capacitances Cg are found to be 421.78 × 10–3 at 300 °C for composition 4% Dy/BVO nanoparticles, suggesting
more polarizability of the sample at this temperature. Hence, the
total electrical permittivity of the sample is mainly attributed to
the increased charge accumulation at the grain boundaries. The calculated
resistance and conductivity according to the equation (σ = 1/R) for different compositions (x = 0, 0.2,
0.3, 0.4, and 0.5) at 300 °C are given in Table 3. Highest conductivity is observed for 5%
Dy/BVO nanoparticles of about 2.91 × 10–2 S
cm–1.

3.1 Photocatalytic Activity
of the Dy-Doped BVO
Photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared
BVO and Dy-doped (2,
3, 4, and 5%) BVO nanoparticles were estimated using TC drug degradation
under visible light using Xe lamp irradiation, and the photodegradation
efficiency of TC versus reaction time is shown in Figure 5a. Because of the stability
of TC drug, the degradation TC drug were very low in the absence of
the photocatalyst under dark and visible light irradiation. In the
case of BVO nanoparticle photocatalysts, only 3% of TC is removed
within 60 min without light irradiation. However, under the same conditions,
about 5% of TC is absorbed by Dy/BVO photocatalysts, which is due
to the fact that drug molecules can adsorb from solution to the surface
of photocatalysts. The comparative study of photodegradation of TC
drug over different Dy/BVO as a photocatalyst for a period of 120
min in the photoreactor has been carried out. It has been noticed
that Dy/BVO nanoparticles exhibit higher photocatalytic activity as
compared with BVO nanoparticles. To know the reaction kinetics of
TC drug degradation in this study, the pseudo-first-order kinetics
equation is used to fit experimental data. The degradation of TC follows
pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics. The values are present in Figure 5b.

efficiency of TC in the presence of BVO and
Dy-doped BVO nanoparticles and (b) pseudo-first-order kinetic rate
constant k for TC degradation.

3.1.1 Recycle and Stability of the Catalyst
The reusability of the photocatalytic is a serious problem for
long-term use in the realistic application of the photocatalyst. The
reusability of Dy/BVO nanoparticles was tested for the degradation
of TC under identical reaction conditions. After complete degradation,
the catalysts were separated and washed with deionized water. The
recovered catalysts were dried and used for the next run. Figure 6a shows the results
of TC drug photodegradation for five runs of the 5% Dy/BVO nanoparticles.
5% Dy/BVO nanoparticles exhibit TC drug degradation efficiency which
is 95–93% from first to fifth runs, respectively, for 120 min.
Furthermore, 5% Dy/BVO nanoparticles can be easily separated when
compared to the BVO nanoparticles. Figure 6b shows SEM image of 5% Dy/BVO nanoparticles
after the fifth run.

and (b)
SEM images of 5% Dy/BVO nanocomposites after the photocatalytic reaction.

3.1.2 Active
Species Responsible for TC Degradation
To elucidate the photocatalytic
mechanism, tert-butyl alcohol (TBA, a hydroxyl radical
scavenge) and disodium salt
of ethlyenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA-2Na, a photogenerated hole
scavenger) were adopted as a scavenger in the reaction system of TC
drug degradation over Dy/BVO nanoparticles. Figure 7 shows that the degradation of TC drug rate
does show an obvious change in the presence of TBA and EDTA-2Na, indicating
that h+ and •OH are main reactive species
in the photocatalyst reaction.

Figure 7 Effect of different scavengers on the
degradation of TC drug in
the presence of 5% Dy/BVO nanoparticles.

3.2 Enhanced Photocatalytic Degradation Mechanism
of TC Drug on Dy/BVO
The mechanism involved in the photocatalytic
degradation of BVO and Dy-doped BVO nanoparticles has been diagrammatically
represented in Figure 8. The band gap of synthesized BVO, 2% Dy/BVO, 3% Dy/BVO, 4% Dy/BVO,
and 5% Dy/BVO nanoparticles was found to be 2.36, 2.30, 2.20, and
2.10 eV lower than the BVO 2.38 eV, respectively. Photocatalytic reaction
occurs due to the excitation of a photoelectron from filled valence
band of Dy/BVO nanoparticles to the empty conduction band by the irradiation
of visible light energy (hν) either equal to
or greater than the band gap Dy/BVO nanoparticles which results in
the creation of a hole (h+) in the valence band. The overall
result is the formation of the electron (e–) and
hole pairs which act as an oxidizing and reducing agent, respectively.30

Figure 8 Proposed reaction mechanism for the photocatalytic degradation
of TC using 5% Dy/BVO nanoparticles under visible light.

The nonradiative recombination of electron and
hole pairs is due
to the higher band gap of the nanoparticles which leads to initiate
the photocatalytic activity of TC drug. Hydroxyl radical (HO•) gets oxidized by the water, which is adsorbed on the surface of
5% Dy/BVO nanoparticles. Subsequently, from the conduction band, the
electrons were taken up by oxygen. Now that oxygen radical converted
into an anionic superoxide radical which not only takes part in the
further oxidation process but also prevents the electron–hole
recombination, maintaining the electron neutrality within the 5% Dy/BVO
nanoparticles. The superoxide recombines with a proton to give (HOO•) which ultimately generate H2O2 which further dissociates into highly reactive hydroxyl radicals
(HO•) which can further oxidize TC.            

4 Conclusions
The BVO and Dy-doped BVO
nanoparticles were successfully synthesized
by the sol–gel method. These nanoparticles were characterized
by various analytical techniques such as XRD, UV–vis, SEM,
photoluminescence, and EDAX spectroscopy. It is observed that the
high conducting γ phase is stabilized for the compositions 4%
Dy/BVO and 5% Dy/BVO nanoparticles. The highest conductivity is observed
for sample 5% Dy/BVO which is 2.91 × 10–2 S
cm–1 at 300 °C. The photodegradation of the
TC under visible light irradiation by BVO and Dy-doped BVO nanoparticles
has been done, and it has been observed that the highest photocatalytic
was shown by 5% Dy/BVO as compared to the other BVO nanoparticles.
