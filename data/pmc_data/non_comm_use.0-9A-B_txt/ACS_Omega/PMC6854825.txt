Pyrolysis is an effective way to
convert biomass into biofuel while
obtaining highly porous active carbon materials. In this study, a
facile approach, involving hydrothermal and pyrolysis steps, is described
for preparing hybrid metal oxide nanoparticle-embedded porous hard
carbon matrices (MnO/C) from the biowaste rice husk and organometallic
precursors. It was found that the pyrolysis/calcination temperature
had a strong influence over the microstructure, especially over the
porosity, but also over the carbon content and crystallinity of the
nanocomposites; hence, the electrical properties can be controlled.
Galvanostatic measurements showed that the nanocomposite obtained
at 600 °C exhibited the highest charge/discharge capacity and
best stability, delivering an initial discharge capacity of 1104 mA·h·g–1 at a current density of 200 mA·g–1, and retaining a value of 830 mA·h·g–1 after 200 cycles, suggesting excellent cycle stability. A discharge
capacity of 581 mA·h·g–1 was obtained
even at a current density as high as 2400 mA·g–1, demonstrating superb rate capability. This outstanding electrochemical
performance, ascribed to high electrochemical activity of the embedded
MnO nanoparticles enhanced by electrical conductivity provided through
the high surface area of the active porous carbon support, is discussed
in relation to the microstructure of the nanocomposite.

1 Introduction
Increasing
environmental awareness and demand for green energy
resources have resulted in the burgeoning field of energy storage
materials.1−3 For instance, lithium ion batteries (LIB) have attracted
huge attention because of their high energy density, low self-discharging,
and the absence of any memory effects.4 Ultimately, the electrochemical performance of the LIB system is
dependent on the electrodes used; however, conventional graphite anodes
are not capable of supporting next-generation LIB as they typically
have low theoretical capacity (372 mA·h·g–1).5 Hence, there has been significant
focus on developing LIB systems using new anode materials with high
capacity and stable response over multiple cycles.6−8 Among these,
pioneering work by Poizot et al. demonstrated huge potential for using
transition-metal oxide (MxOy, M = Ni, Co, Cu, and Fe) anodes, which can achieve
capacities up to 1000 mA·h·g–1, and have
larger volume specific capacity by an order of magnitude than conventional
carbon anode materials.6 As a consequence,
this approach has since been extensively explored.9−13

Manganese oxide (MnO), a transition-metal oxide,
is considered
to be a promising anode material as it has a high theoretical capacity
(755 mA·h·g–1). However, it normally suffers
from poor rate performance and low long-term cycle tolerance, arising
from low electrical conductivity and large volume changes during electrochemical
cycling.9,14 It is known that morphological nanostructuring
of the oxides can facilitate Li+ ion transport and increase
the electrode/electrolyte contact area.10 Thus, in an effort to improve electrochemical performance, electrode
materials with various morphologies like microcages,11 hollow spheres,15 or porous16 structures have been reported. Although these
improvements enhance the rate performance, they do not solve the problem
of long-term cycling performance caused by self-aggregation of MnO
nanostructure during cycling.

On the other hand, carbon materials
offer the advantages of good
electronic conductivity, structural flexibility, and can be sourced
from a wide range of materials; hence, they have considerable potential
for designing novel composite materials. Anodes made of MnO–carbon
composites (MnO/C) provide high electrode capacity, while also effectively
stabilizing the structure (restraining volume changes during charge/discharge)
improving long-term cycling and rate performance.17−19 Composites
have been synthesized from graphene,20 carbon
nanotubes,21 and organic compounds22 using hydrothermal reactions23 or pyrolysis.24 Hence, several
MnO/C anodes with excellent electrochemical performance synthesized
for LIB systems have been reported over the last decade.11,22,23,25 For instance, Ding et al. constructed a MnO/C composite from graphite
using a facile hydrothermal reaction, while having excellent cycling
stability, it also retained a capacity of 497 mA·h·g–1 after 120 cycles.20 Yolk–shell
MnO/C nanodiscs were prepared by Xiao et al. via a carbothermal reaction
from polydopamine, in which a high reversible capacity of 910 mA·h·g–1 at 0.1 A·g–1 was retained
even after 600 cycles.26

As a byproduct
of rice production, rice husk accounts for a worldwide
output of approximately 140 million tons per year.27 In most countries, rice husk is either disposed of as waste
or burnt. However, because of its porous nature, rice husk has very
low density, making it bulky and expensive to transport, whereas the
ash produced from burning can cause significant environmental issues
if directly dumped.28 Hence, there is a
strong need to develop new industrial processes that convert the rice
husk biomass from a problematic waste to a high value commodity. Thus,
various avenues for its recycling have been explored including use
as a carbon source for catalysts, supports, membranes, and nanocomposite
materials.29−32 Biomass-derived carbon materials, especially those embedded with
transition-metal oxide nanoparticles, have been frequently used as
electrode materials in battery/supercapacitor systems.33−36 Interestingly, Liu et al. reported a (metal-free) hierarchical porous
carbon material formed by carbonization of rice husk, which showed
excellent electrochemical properties with high capacitance (278 F·g–1 at 0.5 A·g–1) and rate capability
(77.2% retention of capacitance at 20 A·g–1).37 Hence, it is expected that rice husk-derived
hierarchical porous structures could provide a matrix with excellent
electrochemical properties, which also acts as effective supports
for metal oxide nanoparticles, preventing their aggregation during
electrochemical cycling, which would in turn help improve lithium
storage. Recently, a study by Yuan et al. used MnO2/rice
husk-derived carbon (MnO2/RHC) as anode materials for supercapacitors,
in which enhanced electrochemical performance was indeed observed.38 However, most of the MnO/C composites reported
were prepared through heat treatment of their precursors in an ex
situ process, which reduces the porous area accessible to embedding
nanoparticles.

In this study, porous MnO/C composite materials
were constructed
in situ from rice husk through a facile process involving a hydrothermal
treatment followed by pyrolysis. The carbon support prepared was found
to inherit the hierarchical porous structure from rice husk, whereas
MnO nanoparticles were simultaneously formed inside these pores by
the calcination process. Benefiting from this hierarchical porous
structure, the MnO/C composite material exhibited much better lithium
storage performance than pristine MnO. The effect of pyrolysis temperature
on the structure, composition, and electrochemical properties of the
nanocomposites was also investigated in detail. It was found that
the MnO/C nanocomposite formed at 600 °C exhibited optimal electrochemical
performance as an anode material for LIBs. Given the low cost of the
biomass, the ease of production of the composite, and the excellent
electrochemical performance, we suggest that the approach described
here has significant potential for electrochemical applications including
high-power LIBs.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Formation and Characterization of MnO/C Nanocomposites
The synthesis of porous MnO/C composite material using a hydrothermal
process followed by concurrent pyrolysis is illustrated in Figure 1, full details are
given in Section 4.1. During the hydrothermal synthesis, Mn(Ac)2 and ZnCl2 solutions permeate throughout the rice husk pores. Heating
of this material under anaerobic conditions results in the formation
of MnO nanoparticles and the rice husk is carbonized to porous carbon
with most organic components lost as volatile low-molecular-weight
molecules. It is well known that the organic acid roots of Mn(Ac)2 under high temperature and inert atmosphere would undergo
a decomposition to form H2O, CO/CO2, and MnO,
a stable oxidized form of Mn.4 On the hand,
ZnCl2 can act as a catalyst to initiate the dehydroxylation
and dehydration reactions, which convert hydrogen and oxygen in the
biomass material into water vapor, and result in the production of
porous structure.39,40 ZnCl2 is subsequently
removed by copious washing with diluted hydrochloride acid and water
to yield an MnO/C composite material with a hierarchical porous structure.

from rice husk using hydrothermal treatment followed by pyrolysis
under anaerobic conditions.

Figure 2a shows
the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of MnO/C samples calcined
at 500, 600, and 700 °C together with the reference diffraction
pattern of cubic MnO. The powder diffraction patterns are virtually
identical, indicating the presence of crystalline cubic MnO embedded
within the carbon matrix. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 35,
40, 59, 70, and 74° are readily indexed to the (111), (200),
(220), (311), and (222) crystal planes of cubic MnO with an Fm3m space group (JCPDS no. 07-0230). A
similar conclusion about the formation of MnO can be found from X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses (see Supporting Information). It is interesting to note that the
intensity of the features increases with an elevated pyrolysis temperature
(similar masses and acquisition times were used in each case), suggesting
improved crystallinity of the product. The absence of diffractions
corresponding to carbon and silica materials confirms that the rice
husk-derived matrices are predominantly composed of amorphous carbon.37 In the case of MnO/C-500, a broad signal at
2θ = 23° may be arise from reflections of the (002) crystal
plane of carbon.41

Figure 2 Physical characterization
of MnO/C nanomaterials prepared at 500,
600, and 700 °C: (a) XRD patterns of the three MnO/C materials
together with a standard (cubic MnO), (b) their Raman spectra indicating
the typical D and G bands of carbon materials, and (c) TGA profiles
recorded between 30 and 750 °C in air for MnO/C-500, 600, and
700; (d) XRD pattern of MnO/C-600 recorded after TGA.

The carbon matrix was further analyzed by Raman spectroscopy;
the
features observed at 1345 and 1594 cm–1 correspond
to sp3-bonded structure carbon (D-band) and sp2-bonded graphitized carbon (G-band), respectively.42 The intensity ratio of these bands (ID/IG) can be used to evaluate the
disorder of biomass-derived carbon; a lower ID/IG value corresponding to a higher
degree of graphitization. Analysis of the spectra shown in Figure 2b, provides ID/IG values of 1.26,
0.91, and 0.88 for MnO/C-500, -600, and -700, respectively, suggesting
that MnO/C-700 possesses the most ordered graphitic carbon. As graphitization
is usually associated with reduced concentration of lattice defects,
which is beneficial for electron transport and ultimately for electronic
conductivity, higher temperatures may be favorable. Temperature may
also affect the inorganic component of the nanocomposite. The signal
observed at 645 cm–1 can be assigned to the MnO
vibration, and its linewidth can be related to the MnO nanoparticle
size;43 for the samples studied here, the
broader linewidth of this signal in MnO/C-600 suggests that it contains
the smallest MnO nanoparticles.

The carbon content of the samples
was measured by thermogravimetric
analyses (TGA) performed in air. As shown in Figure 2c, a small weight loss (∼2%) below
100 °C was observed for all samples, which can be attributed
to the evaporation of adsorbed water from the surfaces. From 300 to
700 °C, the change in mass corresponds to the oxidation of MnO
to Mn2O3, as well as to carbon loss because
of the formation of CO2 gas.44,45 The XRD pattern
of the residual MnO/C-600 sample after TGA analysis, shown in Figure 2d, is identical to
Mn2O3 (JCPDS no. 41-1442). Assuming quantitative
oxidation from MnO to Mn2O3 and no loss of Mn
content, the carbon content in the materials can be calculated to
be 28.3, 18.9, and 16.8% for MnO/C-500, -600, and -700, respectively,
demonstrating increasing loss of matrix as the pyrolysis/calcination
temperature is increased, as expected.

The morphology and microstructure
of MnO/C-600 was studied in greater
detail by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM). As clearly visible in the SEM images shown in Figure 3a–c, the carbon
matrix possesses a complex structure with pore sizes varying over
a wide size range as inherited from the raw rice husk material (see Figure S3). An example of multiscale porosity
can be observed in Figure 3b, where micropores can be observed on the inner walls of
macropores. It is generally accepted that the porous structure is
a result of the loss of volatiles such as H2O and CO2 from the scaffold during pyrolysis.46 Large numbers of quasispherical features, with a diameter of ca. 100 nm, are apparent at this magnification, which are
attributed to MnO nanoparticles attached to the surface of the porous
carbon. In the magnified SEM image (Figure 3c), these features of small holes, with an
average diameter of 40 nm, are apparently covered with MnO particles.
On the other hand, those observed quasispherical carbon microspheres
can be produced by the dehydration/polymerization/condensation of
low-molecular-weight saccharides from the biomass during the hydrothermal
process.47 Moreover, TEM images (Figure 3d) of microtomed
samples confirm that the distribution of MnO particles on the surface
of the porous carbon matrix is not uniform. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM)
images reveal no distinguishable lattice fringes for graphitic carbon,
despite extensive scanning (a typical image is shown in Figure 3e). This is consistent with
the XRD and Raman studies which demonstrate largely amorphous carbon.
On the other hand, the HRTEM images (Figure 3f) of areas containing MnO nanoparticles
display clear lattice fringes for crystalline MnO, that is, the (111)
and (220) crystal planes with lattice spacings of 0.26 and 0.16 nm,
respectively.

and TEM image (d) of MnO/C-600; (e,f) HRTEM images of MnO/C-600 corresponding
to the sections in (d), respectively.

To measure the porosity of MnO/C-600, isothermal N2 adsorption–desorption
studies were undertaken. The adsorption–desorption isotherm
demonstrates a type IV isotherm with a H3 type hysteresis loop (Figure 4a).45 The desorption–adsorption hysteresis occurred over
relative pressures (p/p0) from 0.4 to 0.9 and can be attributed to the capillary condensation,
because of the presence of mesopores. Additionally, a rapid increase
in adsorption at high relative pressure (p/p0 > 0.9) suggests the presence of a significant
fraction of macropores in the hybrid, as indicated in SEM images.
The pore size distribution curves were calculated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
method; the result for MnO/C-600 is shown in Figure 4b. Although significant polydispersity was
apparent, the average pore size in MnO/C-600 was 42 nm, which again
is consistent with that observed by SEM, which suggests the images
are representative of the sample. The N2 adsorption specific
surface areas of MnO-500, 600, 700, and the MnO standard were found
to be 681, 953, 1009, and 511 m2·g–1, respectively.

2.2 Electrochemical Performance of MnO/C Nanocomposites
Cyclic voltammetric (CV) analyses of MnO/C-600 was undertaken in
the voltage range from 0.01 to 3.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV·s–1. Figure 5 shows the first three successive scans. In the first cycle,
the cathodic peak at around 0.26 V is assigned to the initial reduction
of MnO to metallic Mn (MnO + 2Li+ + 2e– → Mn + Li2O), and the formation of a solid electrolyte
interface (SEI). The sharp peak at a lower voltage can be attributed
to the intercalation of Li into the graphite layer at 0.05 V.20 The anodic peak at 1.26 V is ascribed to MnO
formation (Mn + Li2O → MnO + 2Li+ + 2e–), and decomposition of Li2O.48 The subsequent cycles differ from the first
cycle because of irreversible nanosizing and restructuring of the
electrode.49,50 The reduction peak is found to
shift to ca. 0.5 V, whereas the oxidation peak is still observed at
1.26 V, suggesting an irreversible phase transformation.51 This transformation induces a decrease in the
separation between the reduction and oxidation peaks (ΔU), which indicates weaker polarization and better reversibility
because of the higher electronic conductivity of carbon support after
the nano-restructuring.52 The CV curves
were stable to further cycling.

Figure 5 CV curves of MnO/C-600 in the range of
0.01–3.0 V at a scan
rate of 0.1 mV·s–1 vs Li+/Li.

In Figure 6a, the
voltage profiles of the initial charge/discharge curves of the three
samples and MnO in the potential range from 0.01 to 3.0 V at a current
density of 100 mA·g–1 are presented. All samples
exhibit the same discharge plateau at about 0.26 V, which we attribute
to the reduction of Mn(II) to Mn(0) during lithiation. The charge
plateau was found at ca. 1.26 V, which we assign
to the oxidation of Mn(0) to Mn(II) during delithiation.53 The steep slope of the curves before the discharge
plateau (∼0.26 V) suggests a significant capacity loss, presumably
as a result of irreversible electrolyte decomposition, and as a result
almost a third of the inserted charge cannot be retrieved. Such effects
can result in the formation of an SEI layer and the occupation of
irreversible surface sites by Li within the carbon matrix.54,55 However, for applications, the addition of additives, for example
LiPF6,56 into the carbon matrix
can mitigate such effects. MnO/C-500, 600, and 700 delivered initial
discharge capacities of 1196, 1326, and 1238 mA·h·g–1, respectively. This is significantly higher than
the initial discharge capacity of MnO (756 mA·h·g–1); we suggest that this is because of the strong interaction between
the MnO phase and the porous carbon phase57 as well as the elevated specific surface area.58 We suggest that the low capacity of MnO/C-500 may be connected
to the low MnO crystallinity and that any beneficial effect of high
crystallinity for MnO/C-700 is offset by the rather low carbon content
(16.8%). MnO/C-600 with intermediate carbon content and crystallinity
displayed the highest discharge capacity. The Coulombic efficiencies
of the three samples are similar with values of 70.2, 69.7, and 71.3%
measured for MnO/C-500, -600, and -700, respectively. The low, similar
Coulombic efficiency is mainly related to the irreversible conversion
reaction and formation of an SEI film in all cases, as it frequently
occurs in metallic oxide-based anodes.6

Figure 6 (a)
First charge/discharge curves of MnO/C-500, 600, 700, and MnO;
(b) charge/discharge voltage profiles of MnO/C-500; (c) MnO/C-600,
and (d) MnO/C-700 for different cycles at 100 mA g–1.

The charge/discharge voltage profiles
with different cycles for
the three materials MnO/C-500, 600, and 700 are shown in Figure 6b–d, respectively.
The profiles are quite similar; a prominent voltage plateau is located
at around 0.5 V after the first cycle for each sample, implying irreversible
restructuring and nanosizing of the electrode material upon initial
discharge. Although, for all the materials, the discharge capacity
of the second cycle is drastically reduced, their charge capacity
only decreases slightly, resulting in a strong increase of Coulombic
efficiency to more than 98%. The capacity loss is most pronounced
for MnO/C-700 (from 1238 to 890 mA·h·g–1) after the initial charge/discharge cycle, presumably as a result
of its larger specific surface area, which promotes continuous electrolyte
degradation and SEI formation that in turn hampers charge storage.51

The cycling performance of the four materials,
at a current density
of 200 mA·g–1, are shown in Figure 7a. Distinct capacity decay
can be observed, especially during the first 60 cycles for MnO/C-500
and -600, whereas the capacity for MnO/C-700 reduced more steadily.
The high crystallinity and large surface area of MnO/C-700 is presumably
responsible for better initial capacity retention.59,60 On further cycling, the capacity for MnO/C-500 and -600 was observed
to decrease steadily, and that for MnO/C-700 decayed drastically to
be almost equal to that of MnO/C-500 by around the 180th cycle. We
suggest that the high specific surface area of MnO/C-700, which promotes
continuous SEI formation, is the principle cause of decaying capacity
with prolonged cycling. MnO/C-600 maintained the highest specific
capacity of 830 mA·h·g–1 after 200 cycles,
whereas values of 621 and 593 mA·h·g–1 were obtained for MnO/C-500 and -700, respectively. In comparison
with the composites, the capacity of pure MnO decreased rapidly upon
cycling because, presumably, of the absence of a supporting matrix.

cycling of MnO/C-500, -600, and -700; (a) rate
performance; (b) cycling performance at a current rate of 200 mA g–1; (c) Nyquist representation of electrochemical impedance
response spectrum.

The rate capabilities
of the four samples were investigated at
different current densities, increasing stepwise from 0.1, 0.2, 0.4,
1.2, 2.4 A·g–1 for every 10th cycle, and then
decreasing to 0.1 A·g–1, as shown in Figure 7b. The discharge
capacity of all the samples decreased gradually with increasing current
density, suggesting diffusion-controlled kinetics for the electrode
reaction.61 After a significant decay in
the second cycle, the capacities of all three samples were relatively
stable, even at current densities as high as 2.4 A·g–1. Note that the initial discharge capacity at 0.1 A·g–1 was essentially recovered when the current density was reset to
0.1 A·g–1 after the full cycle. It was also
found that the observed initially gradual decrease in capacity weakened
progressively with the charge/discharge cycle (irrespective of the
current density). For MnO/C-500 and -700, this process was completed
by the 30th to 50th cycle, and a little later for MnO/C-600. This
is also the highest performing nanocomposite; apparently it has the
best balance between MnO content and porous carbon support. As noted
above, increased surface area of the support apparently promotes electrolyte
decay and SEI formation, with detrimental effects on cycling response.51 However, even at current density as high as
2.4 A·g–1, MnO/C-600 still delivered a capacity
of 581 mA·h·g–1, far exceeding the value
of pure MnO (97 mA·h·g–1). After charging/discharging
60 cycles successively (Figure 7b), MnO/C-600 retained 43% of the initial capacity, whereas
MnO/C-500, -700, and MnO only retained 35, 26, and 15%, respectively.
Evidently, the excellent rate capability of the hybrid material is
dependent on the high surface area of porous carbon, which improves
electron conductivity,62 while it is also
providing an open framework with short lithium diffusion paths,10 and acts as a strong support to maintain the
structural integrity of the nanoscale metal oxide nanoparticles over
hundreds of lithiation/delithiation cycles.

To understand the
differences in electrochemical performance of
the nanocomposites, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements
were undertaken. The Nyquist plots measured for the electrodes are
shown in Figure 7c.
It is well-known that a semicircular response in the mid-frequency
range corresponds to the charge transfer impedance (Rct) at the electrode/electrolyte interface, whereas the
upward trajectory inclined line at the low-frequency range relates
to lithium ion diffusion.63 The diameter
of the arched profile for the MnO/C-600 electrode is the smallest
among the three, indicating the smallest charge transfer impedance.64 MnO/C-600 has lower graphitization degree than
MnO/C-700, but it has higher carbon content with better conductivity.
Consequently, MnO/C-600 displayed the smallest Rct in the EIS tests.

Therefore, the overall evaluation
of the impact of pyrolysis temperature
on the lithium storage performance showed that the composite obtained
at 600 °C exhibited the best electrochemical performance. It
has been reported that metal oxide nanocomposite electrodes with increased
carbon content and crystallinity raise the charge transfer resistance,65,66 whereas elevated surface area is known to accelerate electrolyte
decay.51 As a consequence, MnO/C-600 displayed
the best rate performance, as it represents the best compromise in
terms of carbon content, crystallinity, and specific surface area,
leading to superior electrochemical performance and the smallest charge-transfer
resistance. There are many reports of MnO/C composites for LIB anode
applications for which many carbon sources were used. In Table 1 the electrochemical
performance of as-obtained MnO/C materials from recent studies are
presented. In most cases, the source was low-molecular-weight organic
substances (e.g. ethanol,l-tryptophan, ethylene glycol) along
with a few natural products (e.g. microalgae, pollen grains). Rice
husk, as a major biomass waste, has long been considered as an excellent
alternative cheap carbon source. Compared to other listed composite
materials, the MnO/C rice husk-derived nanocomposite reported here
displays an outstanding performance; with initial discharge capacity
of 1326 mA·h·g–1 (at 100 mA·g–1) measured, along with discharge capacities of 830
mA·h·g–1 (at 200 mA·g–1 after 200 electrochemical
cycles) and of 581 mA·h·g–1 (at high current
density of 2400 mA·g–1), demonstrating excellent
cyclability and rate capability.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
MnO/C nanocomposites were successfully prepared using
biomass rice husk as the carbon source by a simple hydrothermal process
followed by pyrolysis. During the in-situ preparation, a hierarchical
porous structure inherited from rice husk was formed and MnO particles
were simultaneously created and embedded onto the walls of these pores.
The evaluation of the impact of pyrolysis temperature on the lithium
storage performance found that the composite obtained at 600 °C
exhibited the best electrochemical performance. An initial discharge
capacity of 1326 mA·h·g–1 at a current
density of 100 mA·g–1 was observed for this
composite, along with a discharge capacity of 830 mA·h·g–1 at a current density of 200 mA·g–1 after 200 electrochemical cycles, indicating reliable cycle performance.
A discharge capacity of 581 mA·h·g–1 was
also delivered even at a high current density of 2400 mA·g–1, demonstrating excellent rate capability. We suggest
that the hierarchical porous structure of the carbon framework, the
highly crystalline MnO content, and strong interactions between the
inorganic and organic phases owing to intimate contact arising from
in situ particle formation are responsible for this excellent electrochemical
performance. In view of the facile preparation method and excellent
electrochemical performance, the approach described above enables
the optimization of electrode performance for LIBs and other energy
storage applications via a sustainable path involving re-utilization
and recycling of waste biomass.

4 Experimental
Sections
4.1 Synthesis of MnO/C Composites
Zinc
chloride (ZnCl2), ethanol (95 wt %), manganese acetate
tetrahydrate (Mn(Ac)2·4H2O), hydrochloride
acid (37 wt %), N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), polyvinylidene
fluoride (PVDF), and acetylene black were purchased from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (China). Rice husks were acquired from a
local market (Xiangyang, China), and pretreated with 10 wt % NaOH
aqueous solution at 100 °C to remove silica and other impurities
[as demonstrated in Si 2p XPS spectrum (Figure S2)].38 All other chemical reagents
were of analytical grade and used without further treatment. In a
typical process, the rice husks were ground into powder and washed
with distilled water and ethanol repeatedly five times, and then the
powder was dried in the air at 120 °C overnight. Afterward, 1.73
g of the dried clean husk powder was immersed into 200 mL 0.1 mol·L–1 Mn(Ac)2 solution containing 1.73 g of
ZnCl2. The above mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined
stainless autoclave and hydrothermally treated at 140 °C for
10 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was freeze-dried
and then heated inside a tube furnace under argon atmosphere at a
high temperature for 4 h and cooled naturally. Next, the solid residue
was washed repeatedly with 0.1 mol·L–1 HCl
solution and then deionized water, to remove ZnCl2. After
the washing step, the sample was dried at 120 °C for 10 h. To
compare the effect of pyrolysis temperature on the electrochemical
performance of the carbon materials, the samples were heated to 500,
600, and 700 °C, providing three MnO/C composites, labeled as
MnO/C-500, -600, -700, respectively. For comparison, MnO particles
were obtained by calcination of Mn(Ac)2·4H2O at 600 °C under argon atmosphere.

4.2 Material
Characterization
All phase
identification of composite materials reported in this contribution
was conducted using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer with
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). Raman spectra were acquired
using 523 nm line of Ar-ion Laser as excitation source by a Raman
microscope (Renishaw, InVia, England). The carbon content in the samples
was measured by thermogravimetric analysis using a thermogravimetric
instrument (TG, Labsys Evo, France) from 20 to 800 °C in air
at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1. The morphology
of the samples was examined using field-emission SEM (Nova Nano230,
Japan) and HRTEM (TECNAI G2 F30, USA). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
measurements were carried out by N2 isothermal adsorption
using a compact specific surface area and pore size analyzer (BELSORP-Mini-II,
Japan).

4.3 Electrochemical Measurements
Electrochemical
measurements of the samples were conducted using a CR2016 coin cell,
which were assembled in an argon-filled glove box (Mikrouna Super
2440/750). Lithium metal was used as the counter electrode. A Celgard
2300 microporous polypropylene membrane was used as the separator.
The working electrode was fabricated by mixing the active materials,
acetylene black and PVDF at a weight proportion of 8:1:1 using NMP
as the dispersing agent to form a uniform slurry. Then, the slurry
was spread evenly on a copper foil substrate and dried at 80 °C
in vacuum overnight. The loading mass of the active material is about
1 mg·cm–2. The electrolyte was 1.0 M LiPF6 solved in a mixture of ethylene carbonate and dimethylcarbonate
(1:1 in volume). CV studies were carried out in the potential window
of 0.01–3.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV·s–1 on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E, China). Galvanostatic
measurements were performed at different current rates between 0.01
and 3.0 V versus Li+/Li on a battery tester (LAND, CT2001A,
China). EIS measurements were carried out on an electrochemical workstation
(Autolab PGSTA302N, Switzerland) at open circuit potential in the
sweeping frequency range of 0.01–10 MHz by applying an ac signal
of 5 mV in amplitude throughout the test. All the above measurements
were carried out at ambient temperature.
