A new
triphenylamine-based acylhydrazone derivative (TPAH-B8) was
synthesized. TPAH-B8 could form organogels in cyclohexane through
ultrasonic treatment. A typical gelation-induced fluorescence enhancement
property was observed, which was attributed to the formation of J-aggregate
in the gel state. More interestingly, TPAH-B8 exhibited multistimuli
responsive behaviors. First, TPAH-B8 showed a solvatochromic effect,
with the emission color changing from blue to cyan with the change
in solvent from nonpolar cyclohexane to polar dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
Second, TPAH-B8 showed a reversible mechanofluorochromism. The xerogel
of TPAH-B8 emitted a blue fluorescence, while the fluorescence color
changed to cyan after grinding. The cyan and blue colors could be
repeated with the treatment of grinding and annealing, which was explored
and ascribed to the transformation between crystalline and amorphous
states. Third, TPAH-B8 revealed acidochromic property. The fluorescence
color of TPAH-B8 in organogel and solid states could be switched by
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/triethylamine (TEA). This work not only
demonstrated the multistimuli-responsive fluorescent properties of
TPAH-B8 but also offered an easy way to develop new kinds of multistimuli-responsive
fluorescent materials.

1 Introduction
In recent years, stimuli-responsive
luminescent materials have attracted widespread attention due to their
potential applications in sensors, data storage, optical devices,
drug delivery, cell imaging, etc.1−6 Among these materials, the fluorescent low-molecular-weight organogelators
with the stimuli-responsive property have attracted the special interest
of researchers.7−14 This is because the supramolecular structures formed by the fluorescent
low-molecular-weight organogelators through noncovalent bonds (such
as hydrogen bonds, π–π interactions, van der Waals
forces, etc.) can produce obvious responses to external stimuli and
have multichannel response characteristics including fluorescence
change, color variation, phase transition, etc.15−18

Recently, luminescent materials
that possess mechanofluorochromic property have attracted substantial
attention due to their potential applications in the fields of mechanosensors,
security papers, optical recording, and data storage.19−22 As a kind of luminescent material, there are some reports about
the fluorescent low-molecular-weight organogelators with mechanofluorochromism.
For example, Lu’s group synthesized a series of carbazole-modified
pyrazole derivatives. Some of the compounds exhibited gelation-induced
fluorescence enhancement properties, and these organogelators exhibited
reversible mechanofluorochromic behavior under the treatment of grinding/fuming
with CH2Cl2.23 Yi’s
group studied a series of organogelators based on naphthalimide which
possess mechanofluorochromic behaviors, and these organogelators were
used to sense low pressures in the range of 2–40 MPa with a
fluorescent signal output.24 Furthermore,
the reports on the detection of acid by the multichannel response
characteristics of the orgnaogelators have attracted much attention
in recent years. For example, Lu’s group studied two organogelators
derived from carbazol derivatives, which can be used to detect volatile
acid in different states, such as gel, solution, and film.25 Cao’s group synthesized a new fluorescent
organogelator and achieved continuous, instant, and visual multichannel
sensing of volatile acid and organic amine gases.26 However, the examples of fluorescent low-molecular-weight
organogelators with stimuli-responsive properties are mainly focused
on single stimulus-response property.23−26 Integrating multiple responsive
properties into a single organogelator to achieve multistimuli-responsive
properties of a single molecule has always been of interest to the
researchers.27,28 However, reports on multistimuli
response of a fluorescent low-molecular-weight organogelator are relatively
few,26,28−30 especially those with
both mechanofluorochromic and acidochromic properties. As far as we
know, there are only two such examples so far. For example, Xue’s
group designed a galunamide derivative. Due to the introduction of
an amide group, a large sterically hindered group (cyanoethylene group),
and a benzoxazole group capable of accepting protons, the synthesized
organogelator has multistimuli-responsive properties, including mechanofluorochromic
and acidochromic properties.31 Recently,
our group has reported an anthracene-substituted acylhydrazone derivative
organogelator, which showed mechanofluorochromic behavior upon grinding.
Furthermore, the compound exhibited remarkable and reversible acid/base
stimulated fluorescence switching properties in both gel and solid
states, which was attributed to the protonation of the molecule.32

To design a multistimuli-responsive fluorescent
organogelator containing
mechanofluorochromic and acidochromic properties, we introduced two
functional groups. First, we introduced a triphenylamine group into
the molecule. As we know, the triphenylamine group was used in the
preparation of mechanofluorochromic materials in recent years due
to its good fluorescent property and its nonplanar arrangement.33,34 Second, an acylhydrazone group was introduced into the molecule
because studies have shown that acylhydrazone group can be protonated
and used to detect acid or acid vapors.32,35 Meanwhile,
triphenylamine group as a strong electron donor group and acylhydrazone
group with certain electron-accepting properties can form a donor–acceptor
(D–A) structure, giving the molecule a certain solvatochromic
effect.36 In addition, the introduced aclhydrazone
group and long alkyl chain have the ability to induce molecular self-assembly
to form a gel according to prior experience.37,38 Fortunately, as expected, the synthesized triphenylamine-based acylhydrazone
derivative (TPAH-B8) (Scheme 1) could gelate certain solvents (e.g., cyclohexane) by the
treatment of ultrasound, and the gel exhibited a strong blue fluorescence
emission due to the gelation-induced enhanced fluorescence emission
property. Moreover, TPAH-B8 exhibited multistimuli-responsive fluorescence
properties. A typical solvatochromic effect of TPAH-B8 was observed
by changing the solvent from nonpolar cyclohexane to polar dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO). The TPAH-B8 xerogel obtained from cyclohexane showed
a reversible mechanofluorochromic property, and the fluorescent color
switched between blue and cyan. More interestingly, TPAH-B8 showed
remarkable and reversible fluorescence switching properties in both
organogel and solid states. This work may provide some help for the
future design and synthesis of new organogelator with multiple stimuli-responsive
fluorescent properties.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Photophysical Properties of TPAH-B8 in Solutions
As
the molecule (TPAH-B8) possesses D and A groups, the intramolecular
charge transfer (ICT) transition is expected. The normalized ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of TPAH-B8
in different solvents (1.0 × 10–5 mol L–1) are shown in Figure 1, and the detailed spectral parameters are listed in Table S1.

Figure 1 Normalized (a) UV–vis absorption
and (b) fluorescence emission
spectra (λex = 360 nm) of compound TPAH-B8 in different
solvents (1.0 × 10–5 mol L–1).

As shown in Figure 1a, the maximum absorption band of TPAH-B8
was centered at ca. 300
and ca. 365 nm. Theoretical calculations suggested that the absorption
band at ca. 365 nm could be assigned to the S0–S1 transition and the band at ca. 300 nm could be assigned to
S0–S3 and S0–S4 transitions, which will be discussed in detail below. From
the nonpolar solvent (cyclohexane) to the strong polar solvent (DMSO),
the maximum absorption peak of the compound only showed a slight red
shift (∼8 nm), which indicated that the electronic and structural
nature of the ground state and Franck Condon (FC) excited state do
not show obvious change.

However, obvious differences are found
in its emission spectra.
TPAH-B8 showed an intense emission at 401 nm with a fine vibrational
structure (417 nm) in nonpolar cyclohexane (Figure 1b). When the polarity of solvent increased,
the maximum emission peak red-shifted with the increase of solvent
polarity and exhibited a large red-shift of about 59:420 nm in toluene,
429 nm in tetrahydrofuran (THF), 453 nm in dimethylformamide (DMF),
and 460 nm in DMSO (Table S1, Supporting
Information). Such large red shifts indicated that the dipole moment
in the excited state is much larger than that in the ground state
due to a charge-transfer process.39,40 In addition,
the fluorescence quantum yields (Φf) of TPAH-B8 in
solutions were measured (Table S1, Supporting
Information). For example, it was only 3.73% in cyclohexane and 23.28%
in DMSO, showing a negative solvatokinetic effect.23,41

2.2 Study on Electronic-State Transitions and
Frontier Molecular Orbitals
To get a deep understanding of
the ground and electronic excited state properties and the mechanism
of the intramolecular charge transfer, quantum chemical calculations
were performed at the density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent
density functional theory (TD-DFT) levels (CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)).42 Multiwfn and VMD were employed for visualizing
the molecular orbital, electron density variation, and charge transfer.43,44 To save the computational source, the long octyloxy group (−OC8H17) of TPAH-B8 was replaced by a short methoxy
group (−OCH3, TPAH-B1; Scheme 1). The reliability of this replacement has
been proved in many computational studies. The optimized structure
of TPAH-B1 showed a nonplanar structure in the ground state (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The physical
picture of the electronic excitation of TPAH-B1 was revealed by the
theoretical calculations at a time-dependent density functional theory
(TD-DFT) level. Table S2 (Supporting Information)
lists the excitation energy and oscillator strength (f) of the five lowest electronic transitions. The theoretical calculations
revealed that the three highest allowed transitions in the TPAH-B1
were S0–S1 (4.04 eV, f = 0.97), S0–S3 (4.68 eV, f = 0.22), and S0–S4 (4.74 eV, f = 0.14), and the S0–S1 corresponded
to one absorption band and S0–S3 and
S0–S4 to the other absorption band in
the absorption spectra. Figures 2a and S2 (Supporting Information)
present the frontier molecular orbitals involved in the highest allowed
two transitions of TPAH-B1. As can be seen, these occupied frontier
molecular orbitals all mainly consist of π-bonding orbital,
while the unoccupied orbitals were composed of the π-antibonding
orbital. It made absorption bands to show the π–π*
transition features. We found that the highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) density was mainly localized on the electron-donor
triphenylamine moiety, whereas the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO) density was mainly distributed in the electron–acceptor
aclhydrazone group (Figure 2a). Moreover, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of TPAH-B1 were
also obtained by theoretical calculation. The corresponding HOMO and
LUMO energy levels were located at −6.43 and −0.01 eV,
respectively.

Figure 2 (a) Frontier orbitals plots of the HOMO and LUMO and (b)
plot of
electron density difference between the ground and the first excited
states of TPAH-B1 calculated with the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) method.

To get a direct view of the intramolecular charge
transfer, the
electron density differences between the ground state and the first
excited state in the gas phase (Figure 2b) have been calculated.45 The yellow and cyan regions stand for positive and negative of the
electron density differences, which indicate the increase and decrease
of electron density in the first excited state as compared with the
ground state. In TPAH-B1, the electron density differences over the
terminal diphenylamine were almost negative; in the adjacent benzene
ring, the area of the negative parts and the positive parts were nearly
the same; and around −CH=N– group, the electron
density differences exhibited an obvious positive value, indicating
that the electrons have been transferred from the triphenylamine group
(donor) to the aclhydrazone group (acceptor) in TPAH-B1. These above
results demonstrated that ICT occurred from the electron donor to
the acceptor unit in the molecule, which was in accordance with spectroscopic
results.46

2.3 Gelation
and Gelation-Induced Fluorescence
Enhancement Properties of TPAH-B8
The gelation ability of
TPAH-B8 was evaluated in different solvents. Gels could not be formed
by the classic heating–cooling process. However, by the treatment
of ultrasound, TPAH-B8 gels could be formed in cyclohexane and ethanol
with the critical gelation concentrations (CGCs) of 8 and 14 mg mL–1, respectively (Table 1). Figure S3 (Supporting
Information) shows the gel–sol transition temperature (Tgel) of TPAH-B8 in cyclohexane and ethanol.
The sol–gel transition could be repeated without fatigue by
heat and ultrasound stimuli (Figure S4,
Supporting Information). Figure S5 (Supporting
Information) displays the rheological properties of the TPAH-B8 gels
at room temperature. The frequency sweep experiment of the TPAH-B8
gels (Figure S5a) reveals that G′ > G″, indicating the
gel
nature of the samples. In contrast, TPAH-B8 gels could not be obtained
in other solvents by the same treatment. TPAH-B8 can be dissolved
in all these solvents after heating. After ultrasonic treatment of
the obtained hot solutions, these samples finally showed different
states: precipitation in ethyl acetate, DMSO, and DMF; partial gel
in n-hexane, acetone, petroleum ether, methanol,
and n-octanol; and clear and transparent solution
in toluene, chloroform, and THF.

As a typical example,
the spectroscopic study was performed in
cyclohexane because TPAH-B8 cyclohexane gel possesses good gelation
property (relatively low CGCs and high Tg). As shown in Figure 3, the fluorescence emission spectra of TPAH-B8 in hot solution and
gel states (8 mg mL–1) were measured. The results
showed that the fluorescence emission intensity of TPAH-B8 was weak,
and the maximum emission peak was at 436 nm. However, in the gel phase,
the fluorescence emission intensity at 436 nm was increased by about
six times, showing a typical gelation-induced fluorescence enhancement
property.37,47 The UV–vis spectra of the ultrasound
gel, which had bands at 300 and 381 nm, displayed a 19 nm red shift
from the solution, indicating the formation of J-aggregate in the
gel state (Figure S6, Supporting Information).48,49 The formation of the J-aggregate could also be confirmed by the
temperature-dependent UV–vis absorbance spectra (Figure S7, Supporting Information), where the
bands of TPAH-B8 are red-shifted (2 and 7 nm, respectively) during
the cooling from 120 °C to room temperature.

Figure 3 Fluorescence emission
spectra of the TPAH-B8 hot solution and organogel
in cyclohexane (8 mg mL–1). The insets are photographs
of TPAH-B8 organogel and hot solution under UV light.

To understand whether ultrasound affects the molecular self-assembly
and molecular alignment of TPAH-B8, we compared the precipitate (not
treated by ultrasound) and the xerogel from cyclohexane by means of
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and field
emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The precipitate and
the xerogel had very similar FT-IR spectra, both displaying −NH
vibrations at 3217 cm–1 and C=O vibrations
at 1635 and 1641 cm–1, as shown in Figure S8 (Supporting Information), which meant that the intermolecular
hydrogen bonds in the two kinds of samples were consistent. In addition,
the XRD patterns of the precipitation and xerogel were similar too,
indicating the same molecular packing mode (Figure S9, Supporting Information). The aggregation morphology of
TPAH-B8 in the state of xerogel and precipitation was observed by
FE-SEM (Figures 5a
and S10, Supporting Information), where
a three-dimensional (3D) network pattern entangled by long fibers
was obtained from the xerogel, while short bars were obtained from
precipitation. All of these results indicated that ultrasound just
induced rapid nucleation but did not change the packing mode of the
molecules.50,51

2.4 Mechanofluorochromic
Property of TPAH-B8
As discussed above, the simplified compound
TPAH-B1 is nonplanar
(Figure S1, Supporting Information). Therefore
the mechanofluorochromic behavior of TPAH-B8 can be expected.52,53 As shown in Figure 4, the xerogel of TPAH-B8 from cyclohexane emitted a bright blue fluorescence
with an emission peak at ca. 434 nm. Upon grinding, the fluorescence
color of the xerogel converted to cyan and its emission peak red-shifted
to 466 nm. When the ground powder was annealed at 70 °C for 10
min, the fluorescence emission of the ground powder restored to its
original state. This mechanofluorochromic behavior conversion could
be repeated for at least three times without fatigue (Figure S11, Supporting Information). These observations
demonstrated that the mechanofluorochromism of TPAH-B8 was reversible
upon grinding and annealing treatments. Similar results could also
be observed in ethanol xerogel (Figure S12, Supporting Information). Since the cyclohexane xerogel and ethanol
xerogel of TPAH-B8 exhibit similar mechanofluorochromic properties,
we selected cyclohexane xerogel of TPAH-B8 and explored its mechanofluorochromic
mechanism.

Figure 4 (a) Photographic images of TPAH-B8 in different solid states irradiated
at 365 nm and (b) normalized fluorescence emission spectra of TPAH-B8
in different solid states excited at 360 nm.

The aggregation morphology of TPAH-B8 was examined by FE-SEM. As
shown in Figure 5a, the TPAH-B8 cyclohexane xerogel initially
exhibited a fibrous entangled network structure, whereas amorphous
powder with random distribution was observed after grinding (Figure 5b). After annealing
the ground sample at 70 °C for 10 min, the rodlike aggregates
could be observed (Figure 5c).

Figure 5 FE-SEM images of TPAH-B8 (a) xerogel from cyclohexane and (b) ground
xerogel and (c) after annealing treatment for (b).

The hydrogen-bonding interactions of TPAH-B8 were observed
by FT-IR
spectra (Figure S13, Supporting Information).
The characteristic stretching vibration band of the amide N–H
group was observed at 3217 cm–1, which was slightly
red-shifted to 3218 cm–1, and the intensity of the
band decreased; moreover, the C=O stretching vibrations at
around 1640 cm–1 partly shifted to higher frequencies
upon grinding, which indicated that the intermolecular hydrogen bonding
weakened after grinding.54

To gain
an insight into the mechanofluorochromic mechanism of TPAH-B8,
X-ray diffraction experiments were investigated in different states.
As shown in Figure 6, the as-prepared xerogel from cyclohexane exhibited many sharp and
intense peaks, indicating an ordered crystalline arrangement. In contrast,
the ground sample showed very weak diffraction peaks, which demonstrated
that it was amorphous.55,56 After annealing, sharp and strong
diffraction peaks reappeared, implying the recovery of an ordered
crystalline state. This result indicated that the reversibility of
the mechanofluorochromic behavior was due to the reversible phase
transition between crystalline and amorphous states.57

Figure 6 XRD patterns of TPAH-B8 in different solid-state (a) xerogel as
prepared, (b) after grinding, and (c) after annealing.

The formation of an amorphous state upon grinding could be
also
confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments.
As shown in Figure S14a (Supporting Information),
the as-prepared xerogel of TPAH-B8 showed an evident endothermic peak
at 157 °C, corresponding to its melting point. Different from
the result of the as-prepared xerogel, in addition to the obvious
endothermic peak at 157 °C, another weak broad exothermic peak
at 54 °C appeared during the heating process of the ground powder,
indicating the transition from the amorphous to crystalline state
(Figure S14b, Supporting Information).
The weak broad exothermic peak at 54 °C corresponded to the recrystallization
of the ground powder present in a metastable amorphous phase.58

2.5 Acidochromic Property of
TPAH-B8
Because the acylhydrazine group can bind with a proton
to form a
cation,32,35 TPAH-B8 might be used as a sensor for detecting
H+. UV–vis absorption and fluorescence spectra of
TPAH-B8 in chloroform with the addition of different acids were obtained,
and the results indicated that the changes were most obvious only
upon the addition of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (Figure S15, Supporting Information). Here, to test the response
behavior of TPAH-B8 to acid, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was selected
and the response behavior of TPAH-B8 to TFA under different states
(gel, solid, and solution) was studied. As shown in Figure 7, with the addition of TFA
(20 equiv) onto the top of the cyclohexane organogel, the pale-yellow
gel gradually collapsed and turned into a brown-red solution, and
the whole process was completed within 3 min. Simultaneously, the
blue emission band at 433 nm of the organogel gradually quenched with
the organogel turning into a solution. These results showed that TPAH-B8
gel was sensitive to TFA. With addition of TFA, it can make obvious
changes in UV−vis absorption and emission spectra, or even
visible changes in phase and color. In addition, with the addition
of triethylamine (TEA) and ultrasound treatment (this process was
completed within 3 min after the gel was collapsed by the addition
of TFA), the solution could be restored to organogel with the fluorescent
emission recovered (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Fluorescence emission spectra of TPAH-B8 cyclohexane organogel
(8 mg mL–1) treated with TFA–TEA (20 equiv).
The insets are photographs of TPAH-B8 gel–sol transition by
treatment with TFA–TEA (20 equiv) under daylight and UV light.

Additionally, the acidochromic property of TPAH-B8
in the solid
state was also investigated. As shown in Figure S16 (Supporting Information), when the cast film was fumigated
with TFA, the naked-eye color of TPAH-B8 film changed from pale-yellow
to deep yellow, while its fluorescence color changed from bright blue
to dark yellow. The fluorescence emission intensity of the TPAH-B8
film decreased with the increase of TFA concentration (ppm), and its
maximum emission peak shifted from 447 to 519 nm (Figure 8). When the TFA concentration
reached 1315.2 ppm, the fluorescence quenching efficiency of TPAH-B8
film reached 81.6%. To demonstrate the sensitivity of the film in
sensing gaseous TFA, the concentration-dependent fluorescence quenching
efficiency (1 – I/I0) is shown in the inset of Figure 8. Accordingly, the detection limit was determined to
be 1.1 ppm for the TFA vapor.25,59 Therefore, the film
based on TPAH-B8 could be quenched by TFA vapor and used as fluorescent
sensory materials. Interestingly, upon fuming this film with TEA,
the intensive blue fluorescence emission band at 447 nm can be recovered,
and upon fuming this film by TFA again, the blue fluorescence is quenched
immediately again. This process can be repeated more than three times
(Figure S17, Supporting Information).

emission spectra of TPAH-B8 film upon exposure to
different amounts of TFA vapor (λex = 360 nm). Inset:
the concentration-dependent fluorescence quenching efficiencies of
the film exposed to different amounts of TFA vapor for 10 s.

The interaction of TPAH-B8 with TFA was investigated
by UV–vis
spectra titration experiment. The UV–vis absorption spectra
of TPAH-B8 toward TFA in chloroform (tested within about 1 min) are
shown in Figure S18 (Supporting Information).
Upon titration of TPAH-B8 solutions with TFA, the bands at ca. 300
and 375 nm disappeared gradually and a new broad shoulder band at
ca. 445 nm appeared and intensified, and the color of the solution
changed from colorless to yellow gradually. The new absorption band
implied that TPAH-B8 was protonated by TFA.32,35 However, the UV–vis spectrum of the TPAH-B8 dilute solution
containing a certain amount of TFA changed after being left for different
times. As shown in Figure S19a (Supporting
Information), when TFA was not added, the UV–vis spectrum of
the dilute solution of TPAH-B8 remained essentially unchanged over
time (0–54 min). However, when 15 equiv of TFA was added, the
UV–vis spectrum of the dilute solution of TPAH-B8 changed significantly
over time (0–40 min). The peak that appears at ca. 445 nm gradually
decreases, while the peak at ca. 375 nm gradually increases (Figure S19b, Supporting Information). Similar
results were obtained after adding 50 equiv of TFA to a dilute solution
of TPAH-B8 (Figure S19c, Supporting Information).
The disappearance of the peak at ca. 445 nm and the enhancement of
the peak at ca. 375 nm might be the hint that the TPAH-B8 is hydrolyzed
with the addition of TFA. The hydrolysis of TPAH-B8 caused the disappearance
of the peak at ca. 445 nm, which means that acidochromism was not
caused by the hydrolysis of TPAH-B8. To demonstrate the above finding,
a further spectroscopic study was carried out with the chloroform
solution of aldehyde, hydrazide, and their mixture. We know that the
hydrolysis of acylhydrazone yields aldehydes and hydrazides.60,61 For the TPAH-B8 molecule mentioned in this paper, if the molecule
undergoes hydrolysis, it will be hydrolyzed into compound 1 (Figure S20a, Supporting Information)
and compound 2 (Figure S20b, Supporting Information). We used compound 1 (purchased
from Innochem, 98%), compound 2,62 and mixtures of the two to study the UV–vis spectrum before
and after the addition of TFA. As shown in Figure S21a (Supporting Information), when TFA is not added, the maximum
absorption peaks of compound 1, compound 2, and their equivalent mixtures are at 363, 262, and 363 nm, respectively.
However, when a large equivalent (200 equiv or more) of TFA was added,
the maximum UV–vis absorption peaks showed red shifts to varying
degrees; however, no large absorption peaks appeared around 445 nm
(Figure S21b–d, Supporting Information).
This shows that after adding TFA, the maximum absorption peak at ca.
445 nm in the TPAH-B8 solution (Figure S18, Supporting Information) is caused by protonation rather than hydrolysis.

The protonation of TPAH-B8 and then the hydrolysis of TPAH-B8 after
adding TFA can also be proved by 1H NMR spectral analysis
(Figure S22, Supporting Information). With
the addition of TFA (15 equiv), the peak of CH=N shifted a
lot, which means that the TPAH-B8 molecule is protonated,32,35 and the protonation of TPAH-B8 can also be proved by the 1H NMR titration experiment (Figure S23, Supporting Information). The small peak at 9.8 ppm before adding
TFA is assigned to the H atom of the aldehyde group in compound 1 (Figure S24, Supporting Information).
The appearance of this peak means that TPAH-B8 was also hydrolyzed
in CDCl3 solution to some extent (this may be due to slightly
acidic solution and the presence of certain of water in the solution).
After adding TFA, the peak at 9.8 ppm moved to 9.67 ppm and the integrated
area of the peak increased from 0.01 to 0.06 (both based on −OCH2– near 4.0 ppm, the integrated area of −OCH2– peak was set as 4.0), which means that the degree
of hydrolysis of TPAH-B8 was enhanced (Figure S22, Supporting Information). The peak area at 9.67 ppm increased
with the storage time (0–1470 min), which means that the degree
of hydrolysis increased gradually (Figure S22, Supporting Information).

3 Conclusions
A new triphenylamine-substituted acylhydrazone derivative (TPAH-B8)
was synthesized. TPAH-B8 could gelate cyclohexane and ethanol with
the ultrasonic treatment. A typical gelation-induced fluorescence
enhancement property was observed in cyclohexane, which was attributed
to the formation of J-aggregate in the gel form. With ICT and nonplanar
properties, TPAH-B8 showed fluoresponsive properties such as solvatochromism
and mechanofluorochromism. A 59 nm red shift of fluorescence in a
dilute solution from cyclohexane to DMSO was observed, which suggested
the ICT characteristic of this D–A molecule. Further DFT calculation
revealed that the electron was transferred from the triphenylamine
group (D) to the acylhydrazone group (A) during the ICT process. The
TPAH-B8 molecule possessed mechanofluorochromic property. The color
of the fluorescence of TPAH-B8 xerogel from cyclohexane could reversibly
change between cyan and blue with grinding and annealing treatments.
SEM, XRD, FT-IR, and DSC studies revealed that the mechanofluorochromic
mechanism was the transition between the crystalline and amorphous
states upon external stimuli. In addition, TPAH-B8 possessed acidochromic
property. After the addition of TFA (20 equiv), the cyclohexane gel
of TPAH-B8 collapsed and the color of the system changed from pale-yellow
to brownish red, while the fluorescence of the system was significantly
quenched. Interestingly, when the TPAH-B8 film was exposed to saturated
TFA vapor, its color rapidly changed from pale-yellow to deep yellow
and its fluorescence significantly quenched. The quenching efficiency
reached 81.6% when the concentration of TFA vapor reached 1315.2 ppm.
The detection limit of the TPAH-B8 film toward gaseous TFA was ca.
1.1 ppm. Moreover, the fluorescence color of TPAH-B8 in organogel
and solid states could also be switched by TFA/TEA. The acidochromism
of TPAH-B8 was due to the protonation of TPAH-B8 caused by TFA. This
work will be helpful for designing new kinds of multistimuli responsive
fluorescent materials in the future.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Characterization
1H NMR
spectra were recorded with a Mercury-300BB 300 MHz spectrometer, using
tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal chemical shift reference. Field
emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) observations were taken
with a JSM-6700F apparatus. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected
on a Bruker Avance D8 X-ray diffractometer. The FT-IR spectra were
recorded with a Perkin-Elmer spectrometer (Spectrum one B). Sonication
was performed on a KQ-2200V ultrasound cleaner (maximum power, 100
W, 40 kHz, Kunshan Meimei Ultrasonic Instrument Co, Ltd., China).
The UV–vis absorption spectra were determined on a Shimadzu
UV-2550 spectrometer, and photoluminescence was measured on a Perkin-Elmer
LS 55 spectrometer. The room-temperature luminescence quantum yields
in solutions were determined relative to quinine sulfate in sulfuric
acid aqueous solution (0.546), and calculated according to the following
equation: Φunk = Φstd(Iunk/Aunk)(Astd/Istd)(ηunk/ηstd)2, where Φunk is
the radiative quantum yield of the sample; Φstd is
the radiative quantum yield of the standard; Iunk and Istd are the integrated
emission intensities of the sample and the standard, respectively; Aunk and Astd are
the absorptions of the sample and the standard at the excitation wavelength,
respectively; and ηunk and ηstd are
the indexes of the refraction of the sample and standard solutions
(pure solvents were assumed), respectively. The thermal properties
of the samples were investigated with a TA Q20 DSC instrument. The
rate of heating and cooling was 10 °C min–1.

Gelation test: the gelator and solvents were put into a septum-capped
test tube and heated until the solid was completely dissolved into
the solvent. The resulting solution was left to cool to room temperature
for over 1 h or sonicated using an ultrasonic cleaner (100 W, 40 kHz)
for several minutes. The gel was considered successfully formed by
the “inverse flow” method.63

4.2 Synthesis of TPAH-B8
TPAH-B8 was
synthesized by having 3,4-bis(octyloxy)benzhydrazide64 (785.2 mg, 0.002 mol) reacting with 4-(N,N-diphenylamino)benzaldehyde (546.7 mg, 0.002 mol)
in ethanol (100 mL) under reflux condition for 10 h (Scheme 2).14 The crude product was further purified by recrystallization from
ethyl acetate–cyclohexane (v/v = 3:1) mixed solvents to get
pure product as a pale-yellow powder (1052.2 mg, 81.2%). The melting
point is 157 °C confirmed by DSC.
