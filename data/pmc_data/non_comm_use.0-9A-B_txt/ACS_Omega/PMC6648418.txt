Anthracenenitrile
oxide undergoes 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions
with 1-substituted-4-(prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)benzene affording the expected
isoxazoles in good yields and as single regioisomers. N–O Bond
cleavage and boron complexation afforded the corresponding boron complexes,
derivatized with either a triple bond for click-chemistry applications
or an oxime group for nitrile oxide 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. The
optical properties of these compounds show potential for employment
as fluorescent tags in imaging techniques. The activity-based protein
profiling assays showed good reactivity for the synthesized probes
even with short peptide chains (epoxomicin). Scope and limitations
are discussed in the light of the obtained results.

Introduction
1,3-Dipolar cycloadditions
can be undoubtedly considered a pillar
of the synthesis of isoxazoles. The versatility of this strategy was
recently applied to synthesize structures designed for imaging. Albeit
the number of works devoted to this topic is increasing, the applications
of the probes constructed via this pathway remain quite low so far.1 In a recent conceptual work, we successfully
employed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of stable aromatic nitrile oxides
to afford novel fluorescent compounds. The reported strategy is the
cornerstone to furnish boron-substituted complexes suitable for biochemical
applications; the nitrile oxide-based protocol is cleaner and selective
with dipolarophiles and can be a useful alternative to the use of
azides. Indeed, once properly derivatized, it can find proper use
in the activity-based protein profiling (ABPP).2

ABPP is one of the most powerful tools to gain insight
into complex
biological systems, e.g., the activity of enzymes in complex proteasomes.3 The aim of ABPP resides in the visualization
of the active forms of the enzymes using chemical probes directed
to the active site of a target protein, resulting in the selective
labeling of the sole catalytically active form of the enzyme.4

Structurally, chemical probes consist of
three different parts:
recognition tag, variable length linker, and warhead (ligation handles)
containing the functional groups to link the probe with the target
substrate with highly specific interactions that make the probe selective
for a well-defined biological structure (Scheme 1). The ligation strategy we wish to exploit
is based on 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition for the two-step activity-based
labeling of endogenously expressed enzymes in complex biological samples.5

Scheme 1 From Nitrile Oxides 1 to 5-Substituted
Isoxazoles 3, N–O Bond Cleavage and Boron Complexation:
Synthetic
Route to Fluorescent Probes of Type 5 and 6
The investigated probes aimed
to be applied in a labeling procedure
that enabled us to label active proteasome β-subunits selectively
in cellular extracts and in living cells.

In our previous work,
we detailed the synthetic strategy and the
fluorescence study of compound 5 that structurally follows
the aforementioned paradigms. The compound is synthesized starting
from a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction between 1-iodo-4-(prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)benzene
(2), affording the 5-substituted isoxazole 3 in very good yields as a single regioisomer. The outcome of the
transformation nicely follows the predictions based on the frontier
orbital theory.2 Cleavage of the N–O
bond and BF3 complexation furnish the corresponding fluorescent
boron complex of type 5 (Scheme 1). The molecule bears an anthryl substituent
(Ar = 9-anthryl) on the tag and a triple C≡C bond on the warhead
end terminus (R = −C≡CH) of the probe, suitable for
click-chemistry applications and late-stage functionalization.

Here, we present a strategy to prepare chemical probes that maintain
the same tag structure, while bearing variable ligation handles prone
to orthogonal functionalization with a proteasome inhibitor peptide.
In compound 5, the triple bond requires the use of a
substrate bearing a dipole (typically an azido-derivative) to connect
the two sides of the chemical reporter (Scheme 2). The newly designed compound 6 bears an oxime moiety on the warhead part that is suitable to be
oxidized to nitrile oxide. Hence, the probe is another 1,3-dipole
that can be attached to a double (or triple) bond located on a target
substrate. One of the great advantages of the use of nitrile oxides
is the fact that the cycloaddition reactions are cleaner than those
in the presence of azides; these latter ones require metals (copper
ions, typically) that are detrimental for the cellular environment.

Scheme 2 Probe Structures: Dipolarophile and Dipole Precursor Ligation Handle
Structures
The two chemical probes 5 and 6 will
be compared from the photophysical point of view and tested by coupling
them with differently functionalized epoxomicin derivatives. Ultimately,
competitive ABPP assays will be performed to verify the maintenance
of proteasome inhibitor properties and possible differences in terms
of selectivity.

Results and Discussion
The commercially
available 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde 7 was derivatized with
freshly distilled propargyl chloride in the
presence of a base under reflux in acetonitrile (Scheme 3). The ethynyl derivative 8 is a known compound6 and was
transformed into the corresponding oxime by treatment with hydroxylamine
in a hydro-alcoholic solution, to afford compound 10.7 The oxime dipolarophile was allowed to react
with an equimolecular amount of anthracenenitrile oxide 9 in anhydrous dichloromethane (DCM) at room temperature for 48 h.
After purification, the 5-substituted isoxazole 11 was
obtained in 66% yield.8 In the 1H NMR spectrum (dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO), the diagnostic signal
of the H4 proton of the isoxazole ring was detected at δ 7.03
ppm. The inclusion of the dipolarophile moiety into the cycloadduct
was also confirmed by the presence of the methyleneoxy group at δ
5.53 ppm (singlet) and by the highly deshielded oxime OH signal at
δ 11.06 ppm.

Scheme 3 Probe Synthesis: From 4-Hydroxybenzaldehyde (7) to 4-((4-(Anthracen-9-yl)-2,2-difluoro-2,3-dihydro-1λ3,3,2λ4-oxazaborinin-6-yl)methoxy)benzaldehyde
Oxime (6)
The selective N–O bond cleavage9 in the isoxazole moieties was performed using Mo(CO)6 to give the 4-[(4-amino-4-(anthracen-9-yl)-2-oxobut-3-en-1-yl)oxy]
benzaldehyde oxime 12 as a reddish solid in 68% yield.
As previously reported,2 the signals detected
in the 1H NMR spectrum denote the existence of an intramolecular
hydrogen bond between the amino group and the carbonyl functionality
obtained from the N–O bond cleavage. As a consequence, one
of the NH2 protons is found at δ 8.47 ppm whereas
the other is strongly deshielded at δ 10.25 ppm. The latter
is the direct evidence of the 6-membered cyclic array kept together
by the hydrogen bond.

The enaminoketone 12 was
used as ligand for boron
complexation,10 achieved by adding BF3·Et2O in an anhydrous DCM solution, in the
presence of Et3N (Scheme 3). Boron complex 6 was obtained as a yellow
solid in 40% yield. In the 1H NMR spectrum, a single NH
proton signal is detected at δ 7.62 ppm, as a consequence of
the newly formed bond between the nitrogen and the boron.

To
verify the reactivity of the fluorescent probe 6 as 1,3-dipole,
we oxidized the oxime group with ([bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene)
(PIFA) in the presence of an excess of norbornene (Scheme 4).11 Norbornene, an excellent trap for nitrile oxides,12 is able to attach the in situ formed nitrile oxide from
compound 6, affording the corresponding 1,3-dipolar cycloadduct 13 in 81% yield, and the reaction does not require any metal
promoter such as copper that is normally used with azides. Hence,
the reaction is cleaner, and after simple chromatographic purification,
compound 13 was fully characterized; the presence in
the 1H NMR spectrum of the signals corresponding to the
isoxazoline protons at δ 3.64 and 4.55 ppm clearly indicates
the successful coupling between the nitrile oxide moiety and the C=C
double bond of the norbornene.

Scheme 4 1,3-Dipolar Cycloaddition Reaction
of Probe 6 with Norbornene
To evaluate the potential use of the new boron complex 6 as a chemical probe in biological studies, we performed
some UV–vis
and fluorescence studies in solvents of different polarities, comparing
the results with those previously obtained for compound 5.2

Figure 1 shows the
UV–vis spectra of compounds 5 and 6 in DCM as solvent. The oxime derivative 6 showed an
absorption band at 384 nm (ε = 5.00 × 103 M–1 cm–1) with a shoulder at 238 nm
and vibrational peaks. Analogously, the BF2 complex 5 shows an absorption band at 387 nm (ε = 8.20 ×
103 M–1 cm–1) along
with more structured vibrational peaks compared with compound 6. The change in functional groups on the phenyl ring does
not drastically shift the absorption peak in the near-UV region. It
however results in a broadening of the absorption band around 250
nm that merges with the blue-shifted shoulder.

Figure 1 UV–vis spectra
of compounds 5 (A) and 6 (B) in DCM (2 ×
10–5 M solutions).

The fluorescence emission spectra of 5 and 6 are shown in Figure 2. The fluorescence maxima for both the compounds appear at
490 nm,
indicating a Stokes’ shift of ca. 5630 cm–1 for the two complexes. The emission spectra are structureless for
both compounds and present a single intense peak. The complete loss
of the vibrational features, along with the considerable Stokes’
shift, could be indicative of a structural rearrangement occurring
at the excited state. This feature is less pronounced in more rigid
fluorescent boron derivatives.13 Indeed,
the first excited-state optimized structure of compound 6 at the SMD(DCM)-TD-CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)//TD-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level
of theory differs from the Franck–Condon one, due to the torsion
along the bond connecting the boracycle to the anthryl moiety.14 The associated dihedral angle varies from ca.
66 to 41°. Such a structural change is an indication of the nature
of the electronic transition associated to fluorescence. The excited
state populates an antibonding orbital that spans from the anthryl
moiety to the boracycle with an electron coming from the anthracene
(see Figure 3). Consequently,
the two connected cycles involved in the transition bend to increase
the conjugation in the molecule.

black line, emission).

Figure 3 Optimized structure of the ground state of compound 6 (A) and its first excited state (B). Orbitals involved in the first
excite state of 6 without (C, D) and with (E, F) protic
interactions taken into account. All calculations are at the SMD(DCM)-(TD)-CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)//(TD)-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)
level, and the structures correspond to energy minima.

In DCM, compound 6 is characterized
by fluorescence
quantum yield ΦF = 0.07 whereas compound 5 exhibits ΦF = 0.602 (both values were
determined relative to the fluorescent intensity of a boron-substituted
reference compound; for further details refer to the Supporting Information SI).10 The
low quantum yields of compound 6 even in DCM could be
the indication of intermolecular quenching of fluorescence. It is
known that a protic environment can influence the excited-state nature
of fluorophores.15 The source of this interaction
could be the hydroxylamino derivative in compound 6,
absent in compound 5. To test our hypothesis, we optimized
compound 6 at the SMD(DCM)-TD-CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)//TD-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)
level, in the presence of a water molecule, as a prototypical protic
compound. In this case, the excited-state changes in nature and a
charge-transfer electron transfer from the phenoxy moiety to the anthryl
one quenches the fluorescence. Hence, we can conclude that the interaction
of 6 with a protic solvent or with its hydroxylamino
moiety can be the culprit for the low quantum yields of 6 (see Figure 3).

The solvent effect on the absorption and fluorescence properties
of the new boron complex 6 was examined (spectra reported
in the SI), and Table 1 reports the ΦF values obtained.
The absorption (λmax) values of 6 are
not affected by solvent polarity, suggesting that the dipole moments
of the molecule in the ground and excited states are almost the same.16 On the other hand, the maximum of fluorescence
emission (λem) values showed a blue shift of about
40 nm in polar solvents with respect to the value in DCM. This determined
a Stokes’ shift reduction at just about ca. 3820 cm–1. These results show the same trend as that observed for compound 5.2 Significantly, the ΦF values dramatically diminish upon polarity changes as well
as viscosity; remarkable drops in quantum yields are observed in MeOH
(0.01) and in ethylene glycol (0.02). The same happens in the 1:1
DMSO/H2O mixture with ΦF value = 0.01.
This could suggest some drawbacks when the compound is used in a biological
environment.17

On
the basis of novel and previous observations and with the aim
to employ compounds 5 and 6 in ABPP assays,
we performed a series of coupling experiments with suitable epoxomicin
derivatives. Azido-substituted epoxomicin 14, a proteasome
inhibitor peptide, was coupled with the ethynyl-probe 5 under standard click-reaction conditions (Scheme 5).3,4 The expected product 15 was isolated and purified by column chromatography. Retaining
of water in the final compound required a prolonged drying step. After
the drying process, the product was obtained in 55% yield and the
mass spectrum (MS) reported a mass value of 1023.30 m/z corresponding to the molecular weight of 15 (1006.94 m/z) plus OH
(MW + OH). This discrepancy in the MS spectra values can be tentatively
attributed to the harsh purification protocol followed (even with
standard methods) that presumably left on the polar peptide chain
residues of the basic treatment. We cannot exclude the epoxide ring
opening to give a diol or even the stabilization of the hydrate forms
of the carbonyl group adjacent to the oxirane ring.

On the other hand, norbornene-substituted epoxomicin 16 was allowed to react with oxime 6 under oxidative
conditions
(using phenyliodine diacetate (PIDA) as an oxidant in dimethylformamide
(DMF) at room temperature). The in situ-generated nitrile oxide of 6 was added exo-selectively19 to
the C=C bond of the norbornene moiety to afford the corresponding
1,3-dipolar cycloadduct 17 (Scheme 6), presumably as a mixture of regioisomers
that would not affect the biological behavior. Due to the known reactivity
of nitrile oxides with nucleophilic centers and the nature of the
dipolarophile, the purification step was quite problematic and several
steps of chromatographic purification were needed. Nevertheless, the
final cycloadduct was obtained in 45% yield and the MS spectrum confirmed
the structure as drawn in Scheme 6 with MW = 1199.30 (theor. 1199.15) m/z.

Norbornene-Substituted
Epoxomicin 16
The coupling products 15 and 17 were
then tested in competitive ABPP assays (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis, SDS-PAGE) to check the maintenance of the proteasome
inhibitor properties of epoxomicin20 and
the display of fluorescence properties. The competitive SDS-PAGE assay
was performed with some other marked proteasome inhibitors (details
in the SI).

The analysis was done
on Raji cell lysate (1 μL), containing
both immuno and constitutive proteasome ([proteasome] = 20 μg
μL–1). Different samples of lysate were incubated
for half an hour at 37 °C along with 9 μL of 26S assay
buffer and 1 μL of a DMSO solution of compounds 15 or 17 at different concentrations (0, 0.1, 1, 10, and
100 μM). Then, 1 μL of the 10 × ABP cocktail was
added and the samples were incubated for other 30 min. Finally, 5
μL of the 4× sample buffer to denature and reduce proteins
was added and the samples were boiled at 100 °C for 5 min.

The samples were fixed in the different lanes of a SDS-PAGE stacking
gel and then were made to run by gel electrophoresis on the running
gel. Figure 4 shows
the SDS-PAGE gel results where in the lane 1, it is possible to see
the different β subunits of the proteasome, highlighted with
specific fluorescent markers that bind them selectively: in blue,
Cy5-NC-001 linked to the β1 subunits, in green, BODIPY(FL)-LU-112
was selective to the β2 ones, and in red, BODIPY(TMR)-NC-005-VS
linked to the β5 ones.

Figure 4 SDS-PAGE gel of compounds 15 and 17 (lanes
2, 3, 4, and 5, for increasing concentrations of probe 15; lanes 7, 8, 9, and 10 for increasing concentrations of probe 17; lane 1, specific fluorescent markers for β subunits;
and lane 6, a molecular weight marker for reference).

In lane 2, 3, 4, and 5, increasing concentrations
of probe 15 (from 10 to 104 nM) are reported,
whereas in
lane 7, 8, 9, and 10, the same increasing concentration of probe 17 (from 10 to 104 nM) can be found. For a concentration
of 1000 nM, both probes show a very good competition in binding the
proteasome; in fact, in lanes 4 and 5 and 9 and 10 the colored lines
relative to the other marked inhibitors are not visible. In lane 8,
the red stripes relative to the β5 subunits disappeared, suggesting
a higher activity of the probe 17 for these subunits.

To detect the fluorescence of probes 15 and 17 while they bind the proteasome, several different light
sources were tried to excite the fluorophores but unluckily they did
not match the excitation wavelength of our probes and no fluorescence
were registered. Some possible explanations can be considered. We
cannot state if these probes maintain their fluorescence during the
interaction with the proteasome; it is also possible that the fluorophores
maintain their optical properties but the excitation was not efficient.
Alternatively, the probes 15 and 17 were
not strong enough from the fluorescence point of view to be detected
with the instruments employed. We cannot exclude potential quenching
or degradation (instability of the boron complex) during the interaction
with the proteasome.

Conclusions
In conclusion, this
work has shown the possible and reliable application
of nitrile oxide chemistry in the biomedical field, especially as
starting materials for the synthesis of some fluorescent probes. The
chemistry of isoxazoles,21 dating to many
decades ago, in the field of imaging probes seems to be a promising
and valuable alternative to azides.22 Azides,
in fact, do suffer from the need of copper to perform correctly the
cycloaddition. The use of copper and metals in general is detrimental
in a biological environment, and the chemistry we offer by replacing
azides with nitrile oxides is cleaner and safer; the construction
of the boron complexes is simple, reliable, and robust. The methodology
can be applied by taking advantage of the variety of structures having
the aldehydes as starting compounds, to prepare corresponding nitrile
oxides. In light of this, we have indeed demonstrated the possibility
to expand the application of 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions to
obtain a group of easily derivatizable fluorescent probes. We were
able to obtain two novel boron fluorescent probes 15 and 17 that enhance the range of reactions suitable for the coupling
with proteasome inhibitors. For this purpose, the optical properties
of these compounds were investigated and suggest the potential for
employment as fluorescent tags in imaging techniques. The drop of
fluorescence quantum yield values for compound 6 with
respect to 5 remains a problem whose solution is not
far from the synthetic route we have followed, while maintaining the
validity of the chemical strategy. The moderate quantum yield values
maintained in the DMSO/H2O mixture confirm the suitability
of these compounds in the cellular environment. The ABPP assays performed
did not give us the ultimate answer about the behavior of compounds 15 and 17 in SDS-PAGE analyses. The coupling
tests performed showed good reactivity for the probes 15 and 17, even with short peptide chains such as epoxomicin.
Improvement of the fluorescence properties of enaminoketone-based
boron complexes is needed and actively pursued. At present, the tuning
of the optical properties of the probes is a crucial point for making
these compounds competitive with commercial ABPP probes. The stability
of the boron complex within the lisate environment is also a key point
for its application in imaging techniques.

Design, synthesis,
and application: these aspects must be synchronized
and to do that, brand new isoxazole derivatives are currently under
preparation by functionalizing the anthryl moiety with several aromatic
rings bearing donor and acceptor substituents by means of the Suzuki
coupling; moreover, selected heterocycles have been inserted too (Scheme 7).23

Scheme 7 Synthetic Strategy toward Newly Designed Fluorescent
Probes
The Spacer can be also deleted,
leaving a fully conjugated system.

This revised
and enlarged library of isoxazoles was already verified
to show unexpected intense fluorescent properties, even stronger than
the corresponding boron complexes. Fluorescent studies are actively
pursued to compare the photochemical behavior of the uncomplexed and
complexed probe couples (see Scheme 7) to determine the real need of a boron complex to
display optical properties in this type of compound. These findings
will be communicated in a full paper that is under preparation.

Synthesis of 4-((4-(Anthracen-9-yl)-2,2-difluoro-2,3-dihydro-1λ3,3,2λ4-oxazaborinin-6-yl)methoxy)benzaldehyde
Oxime (6)
Compound 12 (2.30 mmol,
916 mg) was dissolved in 100 mL of anhydrous DCM along with 10 mL
of distilled triethylamine in a 250 mL three-necked bottom flask.
The solution was stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere for 10 min, and
then 4 mL of boron trifluoride etherate (32.4 mmol) was added. The
reaction was stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere overnight. The mixture
was then diluted with DCM (20 mL) and washed with brine (3 ×
50 mL). The organic phase was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and evaporated, obtaining a dark oil. The crude product was
then purified on column chromatography, giving a yellow solid of 6 in 40% yield (409 mg). Mp: 179–184 °C from from

Synthesis
of (2S,3R)-2-(2-(4-(4-((4-(Anthracen-9-yl)-2,2-difluoro-2,3-dihydro-1λ3,3,2λ4-oxazaborinin-6-yl)methoxy)phenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)acetamido)-N-((2S,3R)-1-(((2S,3S)-3-hydroxy-1-(((S)-4-methyl-1-((R)-2-methyloxiran-2-yl)-1-oxopentan-2-yl)amino)-1-oxobutan-2-yl)amino)-3-methyl-1-oxopentan-2-yl)-3-methylpentanamide
(15)
Alkynyl fluorescent probe 5 (2.71 mg, 6.37 μmol) was dissolved in 1 mL of argon-degassed
DMF along with 3.64 mg (6.26 μmol) of azido-epoxomicin 14. An aqueous solution of CuSO4 (1 mg, 4 μmol)
and sodium ascorbate (1 mg, 5 μmol) was added to the mixture,
and the solution was then stirred overnight at room temperature under
an argon atmosphere.

The crude product was purified by silica
gel column chromatography (DCM/MeOH 9:1) to give 8.59 mg of cycloadduct 15 (6.37 μmol).

The product weight was initially
higher than expected probably
due to some water residue that was very difficult to remove. After
a series of careful drying processes, the product, obtained in 55%
yield, was submitted for relative characterization by mass spectrometry.

The mass spectrum (MS) reporting a mass value of 1023.30 m/z corresponds to the molecular weight
of 15 (1006.94 m/z)
plus OH (MW + OH).

Synthesis of (3aS,4R,6S,7S,7aS)-3-(4-((4-(Anthracen-9-yl)-2,2-difluoro-2,3-dihydro-1λ3,3,2λ4-oxazaborinin-6-yl)methoxy)phenyl)-N-((1-((4S,7S,10S,13S)-4,7-di((R)-sec-butyl)-10-((S)-1-hydroxyethyl)-15-methyl-13-((R)-2-methyloxirane-2-carbonyl)-2,5,8,11-tetraoxo-3,6,9,12-tetraazahexadecyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl)-3a,4,5,6,7,7a-hexahydro-4,7-methanobenzo[d]isoxazole-6-carboxamide
(17)
To a solution of 1.59 mg (3.58 μmol)
of oxime fluorescent probe 6 in argon-degassed DMF was
added 1.74 mg (5.40 μmol) of PIDA. The solution was stirred
for 10 min under an argon atmosphere, and then 1.98 mg (2.62 μmol)
of norbornene-epoxomicin 16 was added to the solution.
The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature.

The crude
product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (DCM/MeOH
9:1) to give 1.87 mg (1.56 μmol) of cycloadduct 17 (45% yield).

Due the known reactivity of nitrile oxides and
the nature of the
dipolarophile, the purification step was quite problematic and several
steps of chromatographic purification were needed. The final cycloadduct 15 was obtained, and the MS spectrum confirmed its structure
with MW = 1199.30 (theor. 1199.15) m/z.

Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Time-Dependent DFT Calculations
Calculations were performed using Gaussian 09, Revision E.01. All
optimizations were performed using the SMD(DCM)-(TD)-CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)//(TD)-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)
level of theory (over the first 10 singlet states). The identity of
the stationary points was confirmed by frequency analysis due to the
absence imaginary frequencies.
