The
introduction of functional groups with varying electron-donating/-withdrawing
properties at the β-position of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) has
been shown to affect the optoelectronic properties of the polymers.
We report the synthesis of a new diketopyrrolopyrrole monomer wherein
a strong electron-donating substituent, a methoxy group, was incorporated
at the β-position in an effort to modulate polymer properties.
Homopolymers and co-polymers of the new β-methoxy DPP and nonderivatized
DPP were synthesized, and their properties were measured by cyclic
voltammetry and UV–vis–near-infrared. Density functional
theory computations also were employed to predict the degree of planarity
of β-methoxy oligomers to probe the significance of the newly
introduced S–O conformational lock. The combined experimental
and computational results showed a reduction in the gap between highest
occupied molecular orbital/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels,
a redshift toward the near-infrared region, and an increased planarity
in the β-methoxy polymers.

Introduction
π-Conjugated
polymers are widely considered to be low-cost,
next generation semiconducting materials because of their excellent
optoelectronic properties and their potential application in inexpensive
solution processing methods.1−5 In addition, they have attracted considerable attention as high-performance
materials, when compared to silicon-based alternatives, due to examples
of charge carrier mobilities in polymer systems of 12 cm2/(V s) in organic field effect transistors devices and power conversion
efficiencies in excess of 14%.6−8 In addition, these materials have
found extended application in the biomedical and optical fields as
near-infrared (NIR) probes for photoacoustic imaging, photothermal/photodynamic
therapy, and organic light-emitting diodes as a result of their unique
tunability and photophysical nature.9−13

Of these π-conjugated polymers, those
that are based on a
diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) core have garnered considerable attention
for the ability with which derivatization allows for the desirable
tuning of optoelectronic properties and its ease of combination with
a number of donors in donor–acceptor (D–A) based systems.14−18 Although many DPP derivatives have been synthesized with aryl and
heteroaryl groups flanking the DPP core, thiophenes continue to provide
an advantage due to their reduced steric component and favorable electronics
when compared to larger aryl/heteroaryl groups in solid-state morphology.
Thiophenes, thereby, allow for planar configurations with longer effective
conjugation and smaller π–π-stacking distances
to effectively modulate the electrochemical and optical band-gaps
(Eg) of polymers.17−20 Other strategies include the
incorporation of various solubilizing sidechains,21−23 the modification
of polymer backbones,24,25 favorable D–A co-monomer
matching,18 and donor unit modification.15 Only recently has the derivatization of the
4-position of the flanking thiophenes of the DPP unit with functional
groups of varying electron densities taken hold as an avenue for exploration
in polymer systems.26−31 Of the derivatives synthesized, most involve a σ/π-withdrawing
group, including −F, −Cl, −CN, whereas the only
other derivative imparts a slightly donating −Me. All of these
showed optical and electrochemical Eg changes
attributed to the newly imparted functional group.

A DPP-2T
with a stronger electron-donating group, such as a methoxy
moiety, has yet to be reported, though evidence suggests that such
an analogue could carry many distinct advantages, including significantly
modulated optoelectronic effects that are completely different from
those imparted by electron-withdrawing group introduction in traditionally
“weak donor–strong acceptor” materials.32 Adding this relatively small electron-donating
group could allow for enhancement of planarity in polymer systems
by providing a foothold for a sulfur–oxygen conformational
lock that can appreciably shrink the dihedral angles between repeating
units and further affect optoelectronic properties.33

Herein, we report the synthesis of a new methoxy-substituted
DPP
core (DPP-2T-OMe) and its introduction into thiophene-containing polymer
systems. With this new set of methoxylated DPP polymers, we systematically
studied the effects of the methoxy functionality on the optical and
electrochemical Eg and compared these
values to those observed in nonmethoxylated polymer counterparts.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis of Monomer
To make DPP-2T-OMe
polymers, 4-methoxythiophene-2-carbonitile
would have to be synthesized prior to DPP formation. Multiple possible
routes to derivatize thiophenes were analyzed to assess their applicability
to our synthesis.34,35 An example was the synthesis
of 4-fluorothiophene-2-carbonitrile, wherein the fluorine was installed
selectively from 2,3-dibromothiophene, whereas the nitrile was installed
through an oxime dehydration.26,27 Another example utilized
a methyl group installed on the β-position of DPP-2T prior to
subsequent condensation and alkylation.28−30 Thus, the synthesis
of the β-methoxy monomer 6 would be accomplished
through a similar derivatization of a thiophene subunit, starting
from 3-methoxythiophene (Schemes 1 and 2).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of 4-Methoxythiophene-2-carbonitrile
Scheme 2 Synthesis of DPP-2T-OMe
Based on the literature precedent, commercially available
3-methoxythiophene
was brominated to form 1 and subsequently reduced using
butyllithium to form 2-bromo-4-methoxythiophene (2) in
good yield.36 From 2, a direct
transformation from bromine to nitrile via the Rosenmund–von
Braun reaction was attempted by treating 2 with copper(II)
cyanide in dimethylformamide at elevated temperatures,37−39 which yielded no product. Consequently, a palladium(II)-catalyzed
Negishi-style cyanation was explored using zinc(II) cyanide.40 After optimization of temperature and solvent,
the reaction provided excellent yields and proved to be a synthetically
viable route to 3.

The subsequent steps of DPP
formation were performed according
to established literature procedures41 to
give DPP-2T-OMe in similar yields to the analogous nonmethoxylated
DPP synthesis (Scheme 2). The condensation reaction of 3 with diisopropyl succinate
yielded 4. The DPP monomer 4 was subjected
to N-alkylation with 2-hexyl-1-decyl iodide to yield 5. Finally, 5 was brominated with N-bromosuccinimide to yield the target monomer 6.

Synthesis
of Polymers
Homopolymers (P1, P2; Scheme 3) were synthesized
according to a modified literature procedure
initially used by Singh42 for PDPP2T after
Stille and Suzuki reactions failed to provide the expected homopolymer.
The target polymers were prepared by combining dibrominated 6 and a Ni(0) catalyst in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran. The resulting
product was purified by precipitation in methanol followed by the
Soxhlet extraction to remove catalytic impurities and low-molecular-weight
oligomers to provide both polymers in excess of 65% yield.

Scheme 3 Polymerizations
of P1–P6
Polymers incorporating thiophene donors of different lengths
were
prepared in high yield through Stille polymerization, which utilized
the brominated DPP (6, 6a) in combination
with the stannylated donor comonomers (M1, M2) in the presence of a Pd2dba3/P(o-tol)3 catalytic system. The resulting mixture was then
heated in a nonpolar solvent system, end capped, and extracted via
Soxhlet extractions. The chloroform fraction was concentrated to give
the product. The DPP polymers (P3, P5) and
their methoxylated derivatives (P4, P6)
were obtained in good yield as dark green/blue solids. All polymers
exhibited solubility in chloroform, although the methoxy analogues
were significantly more soluble in chloroform at room temperature
than the nonmethoxylated polymers, which proved only to be soluble
in chloroform at elevated temperatures. This solubility difference
may be attributed to less π–π-stacking due to the
added degree of rotation and steric influence from the bulk of the
methoxy group, which also affected the resulting number molecular
weight (Mn) and polydispersity index of
each polymer (as calculated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC))
utilizing chloroform at 50 °C as the eluent (see Supporting Information
(SI)).

Optical and Electrochemical
Properties
The optical
and electrochemical properties of all polymers were investigated by
UV–vis–NIR absorption spectroscopy (Figure 1) and cyclic voltammetry (CV, Figure 2). The UV–vis–NIR
absorption spectra of all polymers were measured in both dilute chloroform
solution and thin films.

Figure 1 UV–vis–NIR absorption spectra
of polymers in dilute
CHCl3 solution (a) and thin film (b).

Figure 2 (a) Cyclic voltammetry curves of P1–P6 films drop-cast on a platinum electrode. (b) Corresponding highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) levels of P1, P3, P5 and P2, P4, P6.

When the spectra for the nonmethoxylated P1, P3, and P5 to the methoxylated P2, P4, and P6 were compared, significant
variances due to the introduction of the methoxy substituents were
apparent. As expected in solution, P1, P3, and P5 showed similar absorption spectra compared
to literature standards. Bathochromic shifts were observed at maximum
absorption, most likely arising from the combination of the increased
electron deficiency and the decreased number of thiophene units in
the repeating polymer structure. A similar trend is visible with P2, P4, and P6. The maximum absorption
was observed to have decreased with increasing numbers of thiophenes.
However, the range for P2, P4, and P6 occurred over roughly 280 nm as opposed to 134 nm for P1, P3, and P5. In thin film, this
same trend was observed with the exception of P2, wherein
the maximum absorption was blue shifted. When comparing the solution
to thin film spectra, P1, P3, and P5 showed enhanced vibrational peaks, whereas P2, P4, and P6 showed slightly diminished
vibrational peaks in thin films. Diminished peaks could indicate that
the steric environment of the methoxy group had a large influence
on solid-state packing.

When investigating the optical energy, Eg, similar trends between methoxylated and nonmethoxylated
polymers
were observed. In both cases, P1 and P2 showed
a much higher absorption onset than their thiophene or bithiophene
containing analogues P3, P4 and P5, P6. This observation may result from torsional constraints
related to the incorporation of more thiophene units in the polymer
backbone. These methoxylated polymers showed a significantly smaller
bandgap than their counterparts.

All polymers were investigated
by CV to gain information on the
energies of the HOMO and LUMO. Figure 2 depicts the overlaid CV spectra, wherein the methoxy
polymer derivatives were observed to have a heavy shift in the onset
of oxidation. P2 and P4 showed this onset
after 0.5 V and P6 following not far behind. They each
showed very limited reduction peaks compared to their overwhelming
oxidation peaks. P2, P4, and P6 show a lag in the re-reduction peak when compared to the easily
reversible oxidation of P1, P3, and P5. Polymers with these properties are expected to be primarily
p-type (hole transporting), due to their electron-rich nature.

In the case of P1 and P2, a significant
difference between HOMO levels was present, with the energy of the P2 HOMO being ∼0.5 eV higher than that of P1. LUMO levels remained constant, indicating that the electron modulating
groups of derivatized DPP homopolymers can have a large effect on
their electrochemistry. The HOMO level is altered because donor thiophenes
are different electronically, whereas the LUMO remains constant, because
it is localized to the DPP core. Smaller differences are observed
for P3 and P4. However, with P5 and P6, a drastic difference in LUMO energies is observed.
The LUMO level of P6 is observed to be ∼0.5 eV
higher in energy than that of P5, though their HOMO energies
differ by only 0.16 eV. In this case, the donor bithiophene remains
consistent between polymers, explaining the consistent HOMO, whereas
the LUMO is highly elevated suggesting the localization to the entire
DPP-2T-OMe monomer. Of note, P6 shows similar electrochemical
properties to the popular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) polymer.43 In addition, the Eg significantly increases (Table 1) with the addition of thiophene units; a trend that
is supported by the results of density functional theory (DFT) computations.
Selected molecular orbitals are shown in Figure 3, and additional details are provided in
the SI. In nonmethoxylated polymers, both
HOMO/LUMO levels increase with the addition of thiophenes, and the
bandgap remains relatively consistent.

Theoretical Calculations
Density functional theory
(DFT) computations were carried out on monomers and oligomers to obtain
structural and energetic parameters for comparison with experimental
data (see SI for details). As done previously
for closely related polymers, the B97X-D/6-31G(d,p) level of theory
was used.44

First, relaxed scans
for rotation around the central bond of bis-thiophenes were examined
(Figure 4, top). These
scans indicated that mono- and di-methoxy systems prefer conformations
in which the thiophene rings are coplanar and the S–C–C–S
dihedral angle is 180°, whereas systems with −H or −CH3 groups prefer nonplanar conformations. In the coplanar conformation,
the oxygen of each methoxy group is near to the sulfur of the thiophene
ring to which it is not directly attached. Relaxed scans for structures
bearing diketopyrrolopyrrole groups were then carried out (Figure 4, middle and bottom).
Scanning rotation around the thiophene–thiophene bond in the
middle structure again demonstrated a preference (here ∼4 kcal/mol)
for the coplanar structure. Scanning rotation around the C–C
bond connecting the diketopyrrolopyrrole group to a thiophene, for
either the middle or bottom structures in Figure 4, demonstrated a preference (again ∼4
kcal/mol) for not having a close contact between sulfur and the ketone
oxygen. In short, the methoxy groups prefer to be near sulfur, but
the keto groups do not.

Figure 4 Structures for which torsional profiles were
computed (see SI for details).

Structures of oligomers were also computed. These
supported the
conclusions about conformational preferences discussed above. Figure 3 shows two conformations
of a P2 model containing four diketopyrrolopyrrole groups and four
bis-methoxythiophene groups. The top conformation is favored over
the bottom conformation by ∼23 kcal/mol in free energy (∼29
kcal/mol in electronic energy, i.e., ∼4 kcal/mol per carbonyl-thiophene
contact). The preferred conformation has a slight overall twist, but
the O–C–C–O dihedral angles are all 178–180°.

Conclusions
We have successfully introduced methoxy groups
onto the thiophene
groups of DPP by creating a derivatized 4-methoxythiophene-2-carbonitrile
precursor. A series of homo- and co-polymers using the new methoxylated
DPP acceptor unit were then synthesized to investigate the effects
of the new electron-rich β-functionality on material characteristics.
DFT calculations showed that this motif created a nearly planar confirmation
between adjacent thiophenes, consistent with favorable S–O
interactions. Using optical and electrochemical analysis, methoxy-
and nonmethoxy-substituted polymers were directly compared to reveal
that the new methoxy DPP unit markedly reduced or enlarged the Eg by varying the number of accompanying thiophene
units. Our studies emphasize, for the first time, the tuning effects
of strongly electron-donating groups on DPP-based polymers in comparison
to the previously described fluoro-, cyano-, chloro-, and methyl-substituted
counterparts. According to the absorption and electrochemical characteristics,
the newly synthesized methoxy-substituted polymers may be viable candidates
for a number of functional applications including p-type semiconductors
and photoacoustic probes.

Experimental Section
The electrochemical
properties of the co-polymers were investigated
as thin films in deoxygenated anhydrous acetonitrile under nitrogen
using 0.1 M tetrakis(n-butyl)ammonium hexafluorophosphate
[(n-Bu)4N + PF6–] as the supporting electrolyte. Pt electrodes were used as both
the working and counter electrodes and with Ag/Ag+ (sat.
NaCl) as the pseudoreference electrode. Co-polymer films were generally
drop-cast onto the Pt working electrode from a 5 mg/mL of CHCl3 solution. Monomers and building blocks were characterized
by 1H NMR and 13C NMR, and polymers were characterized
by high-temperature 1H NMR. Full details and synthetic
procedures are provided in the Supporting Information.
