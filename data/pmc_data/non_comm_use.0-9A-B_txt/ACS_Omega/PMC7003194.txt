Multiple chronic conditions (MCCs)
such as diabetes, hypertension,
heart disease, arthritis, asthma, and common respiratory problems
are prevalent in over one-fourth of Americans, and separate drugs
are prescribed to manage each of the diseases. The nutritive crop
seeds loaded with multiple drugs could be a cheap and sustainable
alternative to drugs produced by pharmaceutical companies. Our long-term
goal is to produce chickpea seeds containing comparable dosages of
multiple drugs regularly prescribed for managing MCC. In this work,
we conducted experiments to understand the uptake and translocation
of metformin into the tissues of chickpea to demonstrate the applicability
of LC–HR-ToF-MS in determining metformin concentration, and
to investigate responses of increased dosage of metformin and it’s
accumulation into the chickpea seed. We treated the chickpea plants
with 100 and 500 mg/L metformin chloride and analyzed its concentration
in the leaf, stem, and seeds. We observed that metformin was successfully
uptaken by chickpeas plant and translocated to stem, leaf, and seeds
in both treatments. We also observed that the metformin concentration
is responsive and as high as 349 times increase in seed when the dosage
was increased from 100 to 500 mg/L.

Introduction
Over one-fourth of
Americans suffer from multiple chronic conditions
(MCCs), and whenever a person suffers from one chronic condition,
it makes him or her vulnerable to another condition. According to
the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 75% of
the health care budget is spent on managing chronic conditions.1 A person with diabetes may also suffer from high
blood pressure, which is linked to higher cholesterol levels2 or any other chronic condition. One or more of
the five chronic diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, stroke,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes cause more than
two-thirds of the deaths in the US (United States Department of Health
and Human Services, 2010). According to the CDC, over 100 million
US adults are living either with diabetes or prediabetes (Center for
disease control and prevention, 2017). The health care costs are increasing
every year and the prices of the drugs by the pharmaceutical companies
are unrealistically high. These are two major health care problems
faced by us. The rising cost of medicine is not only true for new
medicines but also for medicines which have been in the market for
a long time. In 50 years, from 1965 to 2013, the monthly cost for
cancer drug therapy has increased from $100 to $10 000,3 which is also true for drugs that treat other
diseases. In the United States, the price of medicine in the pharmacy,
in many cases, is as high as 3000 times more than the manufacturing
cost.4 The success of disease control programs
depends on the consistent use of prescribed medicines and adherence
to the suggested therapy, which is especially important for the management
of chronic diseases.5 Over 75% of the adult
nonadherent population are either not filling the medicines or taking
lower dosages than the prescribed dosage.6 The ever-increasing problem in health care management should be
addressed in many different ways, starting from lifestyle, healthy
diet, drug manufacturing procedure, and pricing, and the use of alternative,
inexpensive, and sustainable sources of multiple drugs. A combination
of inexpensive, healthy, and renewable carrier of more than one drug
could be an effective and potential source of drugs for managing MCCs.

There have been plant improvement programs on the enhancement of
health-related micronutrients, and researchers of these programs predicted
that crop plants could be used as production factories (biofactories)
of therapeutic and industrial products.7 However, there is no such research on depositing active ingredients
of medicine or other pharmaceuticals in the seed of crop plants, which
could be used as alternative carriers of medicines. Also, there is
often no reliable method for determining drugs in the plant tissues
except the studies on the uptake and translocation of metformin and
other pharmaceuticals in several crop species, including forages.8,9 An antidiabetic II medicine, Metformin, is one of the most prescribed
pharmaceuticals in many countries.10 It
is highly water-soluble and because of its ionic form, it is less
likely to evaporate and thus uptake by the root, and translocation
to the shoot is the dominating pathway for the movement of this compound
in the plant tissue.9 There are very few
reports on uptake and translocation of some pharmaceuticals in crops,
especially in the Brassica family.11,12 However, all of these studies were focused mainly on the residual
pharmaceuticals after human usages, which came to the agricultural
soil and water body through human excretes and uptaken by different
plant species.

Like micronutrients, the contents of any other
chemicals in plant
products depend on their availability in the soil environment, acquisition
by plant roots, and efficiency of transportation and storage mechanisms.
The physiological basis of absorption and accumulation of chemicals
in the plant seeds are not well understood.13,14 There are many genes and regularity proteins such as transcription
factors, protein kinase, and receptors that were determined to be
involved in directing and controlling this network.15 The uptake, translocation, and redistribution of chemicals
also depends on the nature of the chemicals and their competition
with others.16 There are minimal concentrations
of active ingredients of drugs present in the soil environment, which
may or may not uptake and translocate into the plant seeds, thus the
treatment of plants with active ingredients is only a viable option
to concentrate into the seed, especially in functional food crops.

Functional foods are food crops that provide health benefits in
addition to traditional nutrients. Functional foods are considered
nutraceutical when used to prevent and treat diseases.17 Thus, a functional food enriched with prescribed
dosages of multiple drugs may bring an effective breakthrough in health
care management and budgeting. The functional food components of some
food crops are of increasing interest in the prevention and treatment
of cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension, which
are the four leading causes of death in the United States.7 Among the food crops, legumes are gaining increasing
interest because of their nutritional value and health benefits. Legumes
are rich in protein, carbohydrates, dietary fibers and are sources
of other nutritional components.18,19 Dietary intake
of legumes, such as different types of beans and peas, may help protect
against numerous chronic conditions, such as coronary heart diseases,
diabetes, high blood pressure, and inflammation.20 Chickpeas (Cicer arietinum L.) are one of the most important legumes; they are a good source
of carbohydrates and protein and contain important vitamins. Moreover,
they have several potential health benefits in controlling human diseases,
including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, digestive diseases,
and some cancers.21 Thus, the chickpea
seeds loaded with multiple drugs may accelerate the treatment and
management of MCC because chickpea seeds can be eaten raw, and a single
seed is present in each of the chickpea pods, which is important in
maintaining dosage.

A number of studies have reported the method
for determining metformin
using liquid chromatography (LC), often with mass spectrometry (MS)
following solid-phase extraction (SPE). The majority of methods focus
on plasma and wastewater using tandem MS with characteristic precursor
and product ions.22,23 Recently, low limits of quantification
were achieved with LC and high resolution (HR) MS.24,25 However, use of a broad range of matrices prevents direct comparison
among different methods of determining metformin concentration. To
our knowledge, few studies reported the determination of metformin
in plant tissues employing LC–MS/MS.8,9

Our long-term goal is to develop chickpea seeds containing multiple
drugs, which could be an effective alternative of treating multiple
chronic conditions. The objectives of the present study were to (1)
demonstrate applicability of LC coupled with HR time of flight (ToF)
MS (i.e., LC–HR-ToF-MS) for determining metformin concentration
in the tissues of chickpeas, (2) understand the uptake and translocation
of metformin into the tissues of chickpeas, and (3) investigate the
effect of a higher dosage metformin treatment on the increase of metformin
deposition in the seeds.

Materials and Methods
Plant Materials and Treatments
Three replications of
three chickpea genotypes, Sawyer, Dylan, and Sierra were grown with
control for metformin treatment at Mayville State University. Three
seeds of each genotype were planted in 8.5″ × 11″
pots filled with Sunshine Mix, a professionally formulated growing
mix containing complete fertilizer and trace elements at a normal
rate. The sunshine mix was soaked with water until germination. Once
germinated, a clear saucer beneath the treated plants was placed and
filled with solutions (100 mg/L) of metformin chloride (1,1-dimethylbiguanide
hydrochloride- C4H11N5·HCl)
until harvesting, while the control plants received only water. Two
of the genotypes, Sawyer and Sierra were treated with 500 mg/L metformin
chloride in similar ways, but only seed metformin chloride concentration
was analyzed. Metformin chloride was purchased as a powder from Accela
Bio-Pharmaceutical (http://www.accelachem.com/) and dissolved in water in required concentrations. At 50% leaf
senescence, leaf and stem from treated and control plants, and after
harvesting, seed samples were lyophilized and ground using mortar
and pestle, and ∼100 mg of the ground samples were purified
and analyzed for metformin contents (μg/g) using the protocol
described below.

The experiment for this study was conducted
in the greenhouse following a randomized complete block design with
three replications. Statistical analysis was conducted in SAS 9.4
following PROC GLM procedure.

Standards and Reagents
Standards of metformin hydrochloride
and ammonium acetate (≥99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, Mo). Formic acid (puriss p.a., eluent additive for LC–MS)
and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-MS grade methanol
were obtained from Fluka (Steinheim, Germany) and Fisher Scientific
(Fair Lawn, NJ, respectively). All chemicals were used as received
without further purification. Deionized water was obtained using a
Direct-Q 3 system, Millipore, Billerica, MA. For calibration, metformin
standard was diluted using 2-fold serial dilution in a range between
0.08 and 500 ng/mL.

Sample Preparation
The sample preparation
procedure
was adapted from Hormazábal and Østensvik.26 Briefly, 1.9 mL of an aqueous solution containing
ammonium acetate and formic acid at a concentration of 450 and 50
mmol·L–1, respectively, was added to a lyophilized
plant matrix sample (0.10 g), followed by addition of dichloromethane
(2 mL). The mixture was vortexed for 15 s, sonicated for 5 min, vortexed
again for 3 s, and centrifuged for 5 min at 3600 rpm. A water-based
supernatant was purified using SPE Bond Elut-LMS cartridges (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) with a volume of 1 mL and a capacity
of 25 mg. Each SPE cartridge was conditioned with 1 mL of methanol,
followed by 2 mL of water and brought to dryness. Then, a 0.35 mL
aliquot of the water-based supernatant was loaded on a cartridge,
passed through (1 mL/min) and collected. An additional 0.35 mL of
water was used, twice, to elute the remaining analyte, and the collected
eluate was combined (total volume of ∼1.05 mL). The recovery
of the method was validated using metformin-spiked sample (corresponding
to concertation of 100 ng/mL), spiked onto controls showing recoveries
of 97.1 ± 06%. The purified samples were diluted to fit linear
calibration range (e.g., seed treated with 500 mg were diluted to
5 μL in the total volume of 10.000 mL); the control seeds (untreated)
were not diluted.

Analysis
Reverse-phase HPLC was
performed using an
Agilent 1100 Series HPLC system equipped with a Restek Allure PFP
Propyl column (length: 100 mm; internal diameter: 3.2 mm; particle
size: 5 μm) with a guard column Ultra PFP (20 mm × 2.1
mm). Agilent 6210 electrospray ionization (ESI) HR-ToF-MS system was
utilized for detection. The column was thermostated at 25 °C.
The mobile phase consisted of 26.5 mmol/L formic acid in water with
1.5% methanol (solvent A), and 26.5 mmol/L formic acid in methanol
(solvent B). The gradient program used for analysis started with isocratic
elution at 0% B for 2 min, followed by a linear gradient to 75% B
from 2 to 2.1 min with a hold until 4 min and then a linear gradient
to 90% B from 4 to 5 min and hold for 1 min. The last step was 6 to
7 min to 0% B followed by a 5 min hold. The flow rate was set to 0.5
mL/min. The injection volume was 60 μL.

For HR-ToF-MS
analysis, an ESI source was operated in the positive mode at 350 °C
with the optimized settings: electrospray (e.g., capillary) and collision-induced
dissociation (e.g., fragmentor) potentials of 5000 and 125 V, respectively;
drying gas (nitrogen) 12 L/min; nebulizer gas (nitrogen) 25 psi.

Mass Hunter package B.02.00 software was used for LC–HR-ToF-MS
data processing. For metformin determination, an external standard
calibration was performed using metformin protonated molecular ion
of 130.11 ± 0.03 m/z, and qualifier
ions of 131.11 (6.6 ± 0.6% of the abundance of 130.11) and 71.06
(0.7 ± 0.1%) m/z. As shown
in Figures 1 and 2 qualifier ions were less abundant, yet their consistent
ratio to quantifier/qualifier ions/ was used as criteria allowing
for quantification. Instrumental limits of detection (LODs) and lower
limits of quantitation (LLOQs) were calculated from calibration curves
of metformin using the equations LOD = 3.3 × sy/k and LOQ = 5 × sy/k, where k is the
slope of the calibration curve and sy is
the standard error of the predicted y-value for each x-value. These values were obtained using a linear least-squares
regression within 1 order of magnitude of LLOQ.

Results and Discussion
Quantification Using LC–HR-ToF-MS
Method
The
LC–HR-ToF-MS quantification in chickpea plant matrices was
based on a protonated molecular ion of metformin extracted within
the narrow mass range of ± 0.03 m/z to increase the selectivity of the method (Figure 1). This mass extraction window allowed for
achieving the best signal-to-noise ratio without compromising the
abundance, wherein a total ion current data (no ion extraction) metformin
could not be easily discerned even at a concentration of 6 ng/mL (Supporting
Information Figure S1). The instrumental
LOD and LLOQ were 6.1 and 11 pg injected on the column. This was sufficient
to directly analyze untreated seeds as shown in Figure 2 with final concentration as low as 70 ng/g.
The lowest concentration found in untreated seeds was above LLOQ of
30 ng/g previously determined in plant materials with LC–MS/MS
with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio.9,26 For treated
samples, the abundance of metformin was so high that significant dilution
(1000-fold) for samples treated with metformin was essential (Figure 2c–f). The
need for dilution was further confirmed by a linear range limited
up to 100 ng/mL (i.e., 6 ng injected) from LLQ. Yet, even with sufficient
sensitivity, as shown for comparison of total ion current (TIC) to
extracted ion chromatograms (EICs), the selectivity of MS analysis
is essential (Figure 2). At higher concentrations, dynamic regression between concentrations
was observed but deemed unsuitable for quantification (Supporting
Information Figure S2). The repeatability
of the analysis, sample preparation, and seed variability are supported
by RSD of 1, 5, and 18%, respectively, showing the higher variance
for different seed batches. The interday repeatability of the same
sample batch corresponded to 7% RSD (Table 1).

Uptake and Translocation of Metformin in
Chickpea Tissues
The mean concentrations of metformin in
all tissues resulted from
various treatments are presented in Table 2. As evident from Table 2, metformin concentration was observed in
the stems of Dylan (15.502 μg/g), Sawyer (44.420 μg/g),
and in the stem of Sierra (and 30.086 μg/g) compared to the
respective controls (untreated) while the chickpeas were treated with
100 mg/L metformin chloride (Figure 3a). In the leaf of the genotype Dylan, 1.486 μg/gm
metformin concentration was observed, in the leaf of the genotype
Sawyer, 1.339 μg/g metformin concentration was found whereas
in the leaf of Sierra metformin concentration of 0.765 μg/g
was observed compared to the untreated leaf (Figure 3b). The highest seed metformin concentration
was observed in the genotype Dylan (5.865 μg/g) followed by
Sawyer (5.786 μg/g) and Sierra (4.133 μg/g), respectively,
when the plants were treated with 100 mg/L metformin (Figure 3c).

To analyze the significance of differences
of mean values of metformin
contents in different chickpea tissues resulted from 100 mg/L treatments
(T1), one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed, and F statistics
are presented from the analysis of variance (Table 3). Genotypes showed significant variation
in stem translocation. However, leaf and seed translocation were not
significant for genotypes. This suggests that genotypes may not differ
when the metformin translocated towards the sink tissue. There was
no significant difference in metformin content between treated stem,
leaf, and seeds observed among the replications.

Effect of a Higher Dosage of Metformin on Its Deposition in
Seeds
To understand the response of higher dosage metformin
chloride on the seed metformin concentration, seeds of two chickpea
genotypes were treated with 500 mg/L metformin chloride. In the seed
of the genotype Sawyer, the metformin concentration was increased
to 1587.41 μg/g that is 274 times higher than the metformin
concentration (5.786 μg/g) when the seeds were treated with
100 mg/L of metformin chloride (Table 2). In the genotype Sierra, the concentration was increased
to 1318.70 μg/gm, which is 349 times increase of the metformin
content when the seed was treated with 100 mg/L metformin chloride
(Table 1 and Figure 4).

Figure 4 Seed metformin concentrations
of chickpea seeds under different
treatment T1- 100 mg/L and T2- 500 mg/L metformin chloride treatment.

Based on the two-way ANOVA, the F ratio is presented
in Table 4. The seed
metformin
concentrations resulted from 100 to 500 mg/L metformin chloride dosages
varied significantly (Table 4). The analysis also showed that there was no significant
influence of genotype or replication on seed metformin concentration
while seeds were treated with different dosages of metformin chloride.
This supports our earlier conclusion that metformin translocation
towards the sink tissue may not be genotype-dependent.

Our ultimate goal is to concentrate
nutritional crop plant seeds
with different drugs, which are usually prescribed for maintaining
MCC. We believe that if nutritious crop plant seeds are concentrated
with comparable dosages of drugs, they could be an important alternative
in human health management and will help to reduce the dependency
on pharmaceutical companies. However, there is no work conducted with
this goal; only there have been reports on uptake and translocation
of metformin into oilseed, cereal, and vegetables, which were grown
on agricultural soil contaminated with residual metformin resulted
from human excretes into the soil and water bodies.9 There was a study on the uptake and translocation of the
antibiotic agent ciprofloxacin and the anticoccidial narasin along
with antidiabetic compound metformin.8 They
selected these compounds based on their presence in environmental
matrixes and to cover various chemical properties. In their study,
they found a higher root concentration of all of these chemicals compared
to their corresponding leaf concentration. They also found higher
uptake of metformin compared to others in all plant tissues they analyzed.
In our study, we studied the uptake and translocation of metformin
in chickpea and found a significantly higher concentration of metformin
in the stem than the leaf and seed, and the leaf concentration was
lower than that of seed (Table 2); this trend was also observed among the genotypes. In our
study, we did not quantify root metformin concentration; however,
in the immediate tissue (stem), we observed a significantly higher
concentration of metformin compared to the control as well as other
tissues. In the studies,8,9 they used contaminated
agricultural soil and conducted their experiments in the greenhouse.
In their studies, they used different plant species and pharmaceuticals
including metformin. In all tissues including root, they found higher
uptake and accumulation of metformin; however, their seed metformin
concentrations varied from species to species and the location of
the fruits in tomato.9 We observed a higher
concentration of metformin in the seed compared to the leaf, which
is consistent with previous findings;8 however,
the metformin concentrations in the stem varied from genotype to genotype
while treated with 100 mg/L metformin chloride.

We observed
286–349 times increase of seed metformin concentration
when the treatment dosage was increased from 100 to 500 mg/L in the
genotypes Sawyer and Sierra, respectively. The uptake and translocation
of nutrients and other solutes from the soil to storage tissues depend
on the transpiration rate, which is increased due to higher growth
temperature.9 In our work, we maintained
a greenhouse temperature range of 60–70 °C throughout
the growing period with a continuous supply of water mixed with metformin
chloride, which may have resulted in a higher concentration of metformin
in the seed. Plants uptake nutrients and other solutes from soil environment
through the root and translocate through xylem vessel and at leaf
senescence, the nutrients and solutes remobilize to the storage tissue
(seed).27 In our work, we also found a
higher concentration of metformin in the seed compared to the leaf.
Higher allocation nitrogen from vegetative tissue to the seed has
been reported in some plant species,28 and
the mimicking effect of metformin with nitrogen was reported earlier.9 Thus in this study, metformin may have induced
the nitrogen transporters, which resulted in higher translocation
of metformin in the storage tissue. Like other biofactory-based pharmaceutical
production, the concentration of the active ingredient of metformin
in chickpea is a major hurdle towards achieving the goals. With five
times increase in treatment dosage, we observed over 300 times increase
in seed metformin concentration. However, to achieve a comparable
prescribed dosage of metformin, we need a further increase in seed
metformin concentration. To achieve this goal, we are growing chickpeas
in the aquaponic method using plastic tubs. Our work clearly demonstrated
that chickpeas could be used as an alternative carrier of metformin
for millions of people who are suffering from MCC-related diseases.
