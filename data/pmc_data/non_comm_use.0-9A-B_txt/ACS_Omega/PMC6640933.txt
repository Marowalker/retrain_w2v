An effective strategy
was developed to enhance the adaptability
of graphene/silicone matrices under external stimuli by embedding
nanoscale SiO2 into the graphene/silicone interfaces as
a buffer layer. Chemically reduced graphene (rGE) was first covered
by SiO2 using an in situ preparation, forming sandwichlike
rGE/SiO2 (rGES). Then, rGES was integrated into methyl
vinyl polysiloxane, followed by vulcanization, producing the final
rGES/silicone rubber (SR) nanocomposite. Such interfacial modification
actually built a rigid–flexible SiO2 buffer layer
between rGE and polysiloxane. Obvious improvements were seen in both
thermal and mechanical properties due to improved interfacial interaction.
In a vulcanized rGES/SR system, the addition of 30 wt % rGES (3 wt
% rGE) yielded a tensile strength of 6.13 MPa (up to 25 times that
of the unmodified rGE in filled SR), a tear strength of 18.08 kN/m,
and an elongation at break of 267%, several times higher than those
of an rGE/SR nanocomposite. Thermal analysis results indicated that
the initial decomposition temperature of rGES/SR containing 5 wt %
rGES (0.5 wt % rGE) increased by more than 98 and 288 °C compared
to that of SiO2/SR and rGE/SR, respectively. The rGES/polysiloxane
matrices showed a tensile shear adhesive strength of 1.78 MPa when
used as an adhesive for aluminum sheets, which is higher than that
of the rGE/polysiloxane matrix (0.93 MPa).

1 Introduction
Silicone
has gained increasing attention due to its radiation resistance,1 excellent electrical insulation,2,3 thermal oxidative stability,4 corrosion
resistance,5 superior fatigue resistance
under extreme temperatures,6 fracture toughness,7 and so on. Thus, there is a wide range of industrial
applications.8 Most
silicone polymer composites, such as silicon rubber and silicon resin,
strongly rely on the addition of fillers to achieve high performance.
However, many directly introduced fillers lack compatibility with
silicones,9 leading to unsatisfactory interface
adhesions and interactions, which largely limit their general applications.
Several strategies have been reported to solve the problem and have
achieved improved properties. The most frequently used strategy is
filler modification via silane coupling agents,10 or compatible groups or molecules,11 which have a lower contact resistance and a better dispersion effect
than the filler itself. An alternative strategy involves the development
of a suitable blending process to achieve a better dispersion state.12 These efforts concentrating on traditional fillers
have been investigated intensively and have shown effectiveness.13 However, the developments of industry have meant
more and higher requirements, which are beyond traditional methods
and materials. Therefore, the development of potential novel fillers,
and corresponding
methods to improve the interface contacts and thus bring a performance
breakthrough, is in great demand.

Among the carbon-based materials,
we have focused on graphene.14 Graphene,
the thinnest material on Earth, possesses
excellent electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties, and application
prospects. One of its biggest applications may be as a functional
ingredient in polymer composites.15 In
the past few years, the direct incorporation of graphene into polymers
has shown enhanced thermal and electrical conductivity, energy storage,
and mechanical performances.16−21 However, the outstanding performances of graphene have
not been fully achieved in polymer composites. A typical reason is
the graphitization22 or entanglement caused
by the van der waals forces between the graphene layers, leading to
insufficient dispersion in polymers. Another important reason is the
unsynchronized responses at the interface caused by incompatible components,
which easily separate from each other under external stimuli. To achieve
optimal enhancement in graphene-based polymer matrices, a high dispersion
and a stable interface with strong interactions should be achieved.23

Researchers have paid much attention to
physical blending processes,
aiming to achieve better dispersion. The methods adopted include the
use of ultrasonic waves,24 milling,25 microwaves,26 and
high temperatures,27 addition of proper
compatibilizers28 or stabilizers,29 screening solvents30 by a solution-mixing process, and so forth. These strategies have
been extensively developed when directly incorporating graphene (graphene
oxide) into polymers, such as epoxy,31 natural
rubber,32−35 silicone rubber (SR),36,37 and so on, to enhance
filler dispersion and the resulting nanocomposite properties. Currently,
efforts have been concentrated mainly on the covalent functionalization
of graphene, chemically, to improve its compatibility with polymers.38,39 Generally, this solution first grafts compatible molecules or groups40 on reduced graphene (rGE) or graphene oxide,
followed by integrating them into the subsequent complexes. For example,
Xue grafted polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) onto graphene
oxide and developed POSS-modified rGE as a nanofiller for polymers.41 Tang prepared silane-functionalized GO and found
that it effectively increased the storage modulus, thermal stability,
glass-transition temperature, tensile and flexural properties, and
fracture toughness of its composites with epoxy.42

The effects of the covalent functionalization of
graphene are relatively
satisfactory; however, the shortcomings are also obvious. First, a
large number of oxygen atoms is required on the sheets for the grafting
step,43 and these oxygen atoms on the graft
sites may weaken the excellent properties of graphene and the corresponding
polymer matrices. Second, the yields are not high
enough, especially for the consideration of large-scale industrial
applications. Third, it is hard to quantitatively
control the graft, which is important for the repeat stability of
the nanofiller itself and the filled polymer composites. These defects
signify that covalent functionalization could not be a universal solution.
Therefore, the effective and stable integration of graphene into silicone,
homogeneously, is still a big challenge. Besides covalent grafting,
modification of rGE (rGE derivatives) with nanoparticles may be an
alternative strategy to improve the interface contacts and performance.
For example, graphene oxide/SiO2 was prepared and used
to reinforce polysiloxane,44 phenolic foams,45 and epoxy composites.46−48 Recently, graphene/SiO2 was fabricated and applied to increase the performance of
PANI,49 styrene butadiene rubber,50 and PMMA.51,52 Despite progress in
polymer performance, some challenges persist. Graphene modification
processes cause increases in the cost of production, and synthesizing
at a large scale and reproducing modified graphene with the same characteristics
are also challenging. The excellent features of graphene in related
polymer nanocomposites, such as silicone, have also not been fully
realized. Therefore, improving the dispersion of graphene in silicone
by focusing on interface modification, as well as interface enhancement
mechanisms, may further boost the performance and applicability.

In this work, we tried a straightforward strategy aiming to embed
SiO2 into the rGE/silicone interface. The strategy is based
on the considerations that not only is SiO2 compatible
with silicone but it also has a strong reinforcing capability for
silicone. To achieve this goal, sandwichlike rGE/SiO2 (rGES)
was prepared through a sol–gel process, and then highly dispersed
rGES/silicone composites were fabricated by direct incorporation of
rGES into the polysiloxane matrix. The mechanical and thermal stability
of the as-prepared rGES/silicone composites were systematically investigated.
The mechanism of enhancement was also discussed on the basis of the
experimental results. Moreover, the fabricated rGES/silicone matrix
showed potential application in adhesives.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Morphology and Microstructure
The
field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) images of rGES-1
and rGES-2 are shown in Figure 1a,d, and their corresponding transmission electron microscope
(TEM) images are shown in Figure 1b,e, respectively. Although they were prepared in different
solvents, rGES-1 and rGES-2 show several common features. The first
similarity lies in the universal layered architecture with rGE as
the internal skeleton and SiO2 as the outer modified coating
on both sides, which is close to a super thin sandwichlike structure.
This special conformation overcomes the van der Waals forces between
the layers of rGE by the intervention of SiO2. The second
similarity lies in the cross-dimensional and multiscale features of
rGES; every two-dimensional (2D) and micron-sized rGE sheet carries
great quantities of zero-dimensional and nanosized SiO2 particles, forming multidimensional and multiscale architectures.
The third similarity is that both rGES-1 and rGES-2 sheets are flatter
than wrinkled rGE, which has a tendency to aggregate (Figure 1c).53 The fourth similarity is that, compared with the 30–40 nm
size of individual precipitated SiO2 in Figure 1f, rGES-1 and rGES-2 have higher
levels of nanosized 10–20 nm SiO2. Perhaps this
phenomenon can be understood as the rGE sheets occupy some of the
space for SiO2 growth, so SiO2 reduces its size
automatically to adapt to this steric restriction.

Figure 1 FE-SEM images of (a)
rGES-1 and (d) rGES-2. TEM images of (b) rGES-1,
(c) rGE, (e) rGES-2, and (f) precipitated SiO2.

In addition to the similarities, there are also
some subtle differences
between rGES-1 and rGES-2, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. One difference
is that for rGES-1, in addition to the SiO2 directly and
densely integrated into rGE, there are also a few loosely deposited
SiO2 nanoclusters on the rGE surfaces, and some clusters
even scatter outside of the rGE sheets (Figure 2a,b). The phenomenon becomes evident when
increasing the reaction time, during which some granular SiO2 clusters evolve into linear ones (Figure 2c,d). Different from the situation of rGES-1,
SiO2 in rGES-2 intensively integrated with rGE and nearly
no SiO2 granules scattered outside of the sheets (Figures 1d,e and 2e,f). The FE-SEM and TEM observations are highly
consistent on this point (Figures 1 and 2). The other difference
is the lamellar thickness; rGES-1 seems thicker than rGES-2. For the
preparation process of rGES-1, TEOS molecules are surrounded by both
ethanol and water, and water is the main ingredient in the adopted
mixed solvents. The contact chance between TEOS and water is high
enough to accelerate the generation velocity of SiO2 nanoparticles,
which exceeds their assembling speed. As a result, some newly generated
SiO2 nanoparticles loosely combine with rGE or directly
grow into clusters with adjacent SiO2 particles due to
the lack of time for ordered assembling. That is why some scattered
SiO2 clusters can be seen on- or off-sheet, and the rGES-1
sheets seem thicker (Figure 1b). For the fabrication of rGES-2, TEOS molecules are mainly
surrounded by ethanol in the mixed solvent, and the limited contact
chance between TEOS and reactant water slows down the hydrolysis rate.
As a result, the generation velocity of SiO2 is slow enough
for ordered and dense assembling, thus the rGES-2 sheets seem thinner
and nearly no SiO2 nanoclusters can be seen outside of
the rGE sheets. To reveal the interactions between rGE and SiO2, the Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR) and
X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of GO, rGE, and rGES are also compared
in Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting
Information.

accounts for the majority in the mixed solvents.

2.2 Mechanical Properties
2.2.1 Mechanical
Characterizations
Shore
A hardness of SR was examined to see the influencing parameters, which
are summarized in Figure 3a. One parameter is the modification of rGE by SiO2 or not, and results showed that the hardness values of rGES-1/SR
and rGES-2/SR are much higher than that of rGE/SR. Another factor
is the solvent volume ratio (ethanol/distilled water) adopted during
the preparation process of rGES, and rGES-2/SR prepared at a higher
ethanol ratio exhibits a bigger Shore A hardness than rGES-1/SR. One
more parameter is the weight percent of nanofiller in the SR matrix;
a higher Shore A hardness is seen for larger filling ratios of rGES
in polysiloxane in the experimental range.

Figure 3 Effects of nanofiller
type and content on (a) Shore A hardness,
(b) tensile strength, (c) elongation at break, and (d) tear strength
of SR composites.

Tensile strength values
were tested to investigate the ability
of the as-prepared polysiloxane matrixes to resist permanent deformation
and destruction and are summarized in Figure 3b. Compared with that of bare SR, the tensile
strength values of the filled SR were improved regardless of the packing
type. Among all of the discussed fillers, pristine rGE showed the
minimum increased tensile strength, and SiO2 prepared without
rGE showed a little higher improvement. Bigger improvements were seen
for rGES-1 and rGES-2 after introducing SiO2 as the transition
layer. For example, the enhanced ability of rGES-2 reached 6.13 MPa,
about 25 times that of the unmodified rGE in filled SR (0.237 MPa),
at the filling ratio 30 wt %, and is about 1.5 and 13.5 times higher
than the commercial and self-prepared SiO2 based SR (4.17
and 0.445 MPa), respectively. The enhancing effectiveness of rGES
on methyl vinyl silicon rubber is obviously competitive to that of
graphene oxide- and carbon nanotube-based systems reported in the
literature.54 Parameters that are related
to sample Shore A hardness also affect the tensile strength values,
but how they affect them in detail is a little different. For example,
an increased rGES-2 weight percent in SR can give a higher tensile
strength just in a certain area (≤30 wt %) but not in the whole
experimental range like Shore A hardness.

Tensile processes
of SR matrixes usually experience elastic deformation
and plastic deformation stages before reaching the breaking point,
and the elongation at break value is a reflection of the whole process.
The relationships between the elongation at break value and the weight
percent of different fillers are shown in Figure 3c. The elongation at break values for rGE/SR
are basically low and stay nearly constant, no matter how much rGE
is used. This result reflects a poor dispersion and interaction between
rGE and polysiloxane. After integration of the SiO2 buffer
layer between rGE and polysiloxane, however, higher elongation at
break values are seen for rGES-1 and rGES-2, and rGES-2 shows a bigger
increasing magnitude. Specifically, with increasing filler content,
the elongation at break for rGES-2/SR gradually increases and reaches
a maximum value at a filling ratio of 30 wt %.

Compared with
rGE and SiO2, rGES-1 and rGES-2 improved
the tear strength of the polysiloxane matrixes to varying degrees,
as shown in Figure 3d. For rGES-1/SR, the value gradually increases and stabilizes with
increasing filler content. For rGES-2/SR, the tear strength value
gradually declines after rising to a maximum value of 18.08 kN/m (30
wt %), much higher than 0.62 and 14.36 kN/m for the rGE- and SiO2-based SR, respectively. The enhancing magnitude of rGES-2
on tear strength is bigger than that of rGES-1. The best, or platform
value, of tear strength for rGES-2/SR appears at 30 wt %, corresponding
to a rGE content near 3 wt %. Generally, the parameters that affect
tensile strength approximately influence tear strength in the same
way, for example, the maximum tensile strength and tear strength are
both observed at the filler content of 30 wt % for rGES-2/SR. After
this point, decreasing tensile and tear strengths were seen at 40
wt %. Furthermore for rGES-1/SR, the maximum tensile strength and
tear strength values both emerge approximately at 40 wt % in our experimental
range. Moreover, the above mentioned mechanical properties including
tensile strength, elongation at break, and tear strength are all controllable
simply by tuning parameters like filling ratio, solvent ratio, and
so on. It is worth mentioning that rGES prepared via our strategy
also works well in silicone matrixes when using commercialized graphene
as the raw material, which was provided by Liu’s team.56,57 Results showed that tensile strengths of 2.9 and 4.5 MPa were achieved
when it was used in room temperature vulcanized (RTV) SR and high
temperature vulcanized (HTV) SR matrixes, respectively, which are
much higher than those of the unmodified ones and are enough for multiple
applications.

The tensile strength, elongation at break, and
tear strength all
decreased when the filler content was higher than 40 wt % for rGES-2/SR.
This is perhaps related to the decreased apparent density of rGES-2
compared with that of rGES-1 and SiO2. The apparent densities
of fumed SiO2, rGES-1, and rGES-2 used in this experiment
are 0.056, 0.045, and 0.032 g/cm3, respectively. The sample
rGES-2 with a lower apparent density occupies a larger volume in SR
composites than that of rGES-1 and SiO2 at the same filling
ratio. Initially, rGES with a smaller apparent density helps to increase
the tensile strength, elongation at break, and tear strength of the
SR composites to a larger extent at lower filling ratios due to the
larger volume and more contacts. However, when the filler content
reaches 40 wt % for the rGES-2/SR sample, a higher filler volume is
no longer an advantage, but a negative factor. rGES-2 occupies a lot
of physical space in SR due to its low density, big volume, and high
dosage, which decreased the mobility and processability of the SR
composites. Therefore, the increased addition of rGES-2 may partly
block the intermolecular cross-linking of silicone, leading to insufficient
vulcanization and performance losses.

On the basis of the mechanical
results, we analyzed the possible
fracture mechanism, combined with the SEM images of tensile fracture
cross-sections. The fracture cross-section images of bare SR (Figure 4a,f) are given for
comparison. It can be seen that rGE/SR has not achieved ideal dispersion
in polysiloxane as big individual filler particles can still be seen
in Figure 4b,g. For
SiO2/SR in Figure 4c,h, lots of highlights, which are partly marked by blue circles,
can be seen. These highlights, a little higher in location than nearby
areas, are mainly contact interfaces between SiO2 and polymer,
and are also presumed to be positions where fracture occurs. Obviously,
the dispersion of SiO2 is better than that of rGE in polysiloxane
due to inherent compatibility. Further, because of this compatibility
between SiO2 and polysiloxane, rGES no longer emerges in
the form of aggregates at the fracture interfaces like rGE but shows
improved dispersion (Figure 4d,e,i,j).

polymer, (b, g) rGE/SR, (c, h) precipitated SiO2/SR, rGES-1/SR
with nanofiller weight ratios of (d) 5% and (i) 30 wt %, respectively,
rGES-2/SR with nanofiller weight ratios of (e) 5% and (j) 30 wt %,
respectively.

Unlike the situations
of SiO2/SR and rGE/SR, the tensile
fracture interfaces of rGES-1/SR (Figure 4d,i) contain not only SiO2 highlights
but also flakes, especially for higher filling ratios. This difference
stems from the microstructure of rGES-1, in which the zero-dimensional
SiO2 provides a spot contact pattern, and the 2D flaky
rGE provides a plane contact pattern. However, SiO2 spots
and rGE planes are sometimes independent, as seen in the TEM images.
As a result, the interfacial contacts and combining force between
rGE and SiO2 in rGES-1 are not strong and stable enough.
In other words, the two patterns lack effective collaboration, and
the connection between SiO2 and rGE easily splits under
stretching, which leads to inadequate stress transfer between rGES-1
and the polymer under external force. Compared with the aforementioned
several kinds of fillers, an obvious difference of rGES-2 is that
it can be drawn out of the polysiloxane composites at low filling
fractions (5 wt %), leaving sheet gaps at the fracture cross-section,
as shown by the arrows in Figure 4e. Another difference is that the spots and planes
interact more cooperatively at higher filling fractions, as a larger
quantity of SiO2 spots are still on the surface of the
rGE sheets after stretching (Figure 4j). Perhaps these are reasons why rGES-2 shows a better
enhancing effect than that of rGES-1 for SR. Also, microcracks55 are not seen in rGES/SR, and therefore the newly
formed rigid–flexible interface has shown better adaptability
under external stimuli, which could help prevent microcrack formation
and propagation.

As we know, covalent functionalization of rGE
often happens at
the active positions such as remaining oxygen areas, the amount of
which must be strictly controlled, and not be too high, to maintain
the carbon sheet skeleton structure and mechanical properties. Thus,
the yield of covalent functionalization may be rather limited, which
reduces the adaptability for industrial-scale applications. Luckily,
with the nanomodification of rGE by SiO2, the yields of
rGES can be greatly improved (nearly 100%) as the carrying capability
of rGE is very high due to the large specific area. Besides rGE, the
modified nanoSiO2 also plays an important role in mechanical
enhancement, as SiO2 has been widely used as a kind of
reinforcing filler in industries. The combination of SiO2 and rGE has significantly increased the mechanical properties of
the SR composites, showing a synergy, as expected. Moreover, the improvements
in mechanical performances are more considerable than the reported
covalent functionalization methods.39−41

Quantitative modification
is important for the reproducibility
of the filler itself and the filled polymer composites. The amount
of nanomodifier SiO2 for the rGE/silicone matrix in our
strategy can be designed and calculated simply as follows. Assuming
that the weight values of the raw material rGE, modified SiO2, and final product rGES are x, y, and z, respectively, x and z are known by weighing. The modification quantity of nanoSiO2 can be simply calculated via the formula y = z – x, and the mass ratio
of rGE:SiO2 is calculated to be x:(z – x), ignoring the sample loss
during processing. For the covalent modification of rGE, however,
it is harder to control the quantitative graft, no matter whether
the modification or the deoxy-reduction is first, because it is harder
to distinguish between the modification quantity and deoxy-quantity
precisely, and there are some small molecules released from the grafting
reaction and much newly adsorbed water after modification. Therefore,
nanomodification is a highly efficient method that can be quantitative.

2.2.2 Mechanism of Mechanical Properties Enhancement
The possible enhancement mechanisms for cross-linked bare SR, SiO2/SR, and rGE/SR are given in Schemes S1–S3. When rGES is integrated into silicone, SiO2 reduces
the stacking tendency of rGE and thus promotes the specific area utilization
efficiency of rGE, and further greatly promotes the compatibility
of rGE with polysiloxane. Thus, rGE disperses in individual or very
thin layers instead of aggregating into agglomerates; the dispersion
of rGE in the form of rGES in polysiloxane is comparable to, and even
better than that of SiO2. Therefore, excellent and stable
interfacial interactions form between rGES and polysiloxane. The stress
transfer for the rGES-filled polysiloxane composites is more powerful
due to their three-dimensional network conjunctions constituted by
SiO2 nanoparticles, 2D rGE nanosheets, cross-linking agent
molecules, and physical connection, simultaneously, as shown in Scheme 1. The increased number
of interaction modes is an important reason for the improved mechanical
properties in the Results and Discussion section.
Besides, the property enhancements also originate from the advantages
of rGES. For example, the nanoscale sandwichlike architecture, high
specific area, excellent mechanical strength, and the good affinity
with the host polysiloxane matrix. Studies by Gong58 have demonstrated that in general, multilayer graphene
will give rise to higher levels of reinforcement than monolayer materials,
with the optimum number of layers depending upon the separation of
the graphene flakes in the composite. Our work here provides a supplement
and development, such that the chemical modification of rGE via inorganic
nanoparticles enables further reinforcement.

Interaction of Polysiloxane with rGES
2.2.3 Application
The application of
the rGES/silicone matrix as a binder for metal aluminum sheets was
tested to see the adhesive performance. Here, hydroxyl silicone oil
with a viscosity of 5000 cP was chosen as the basic silicone polymer
and rGES as filler for the application experiment. Generally, a higher
tensile shear adhesive strength reflects stronger adhesion for bonded
materials. The results showed that the tensile shear adhesive strength
of rGES-2/silicone for the aluminum sheets reached 1.78 MPa, which
is higher than that of rGES-1/silicone (1.21 MPa) and rGE/silicone
(0.93 MPa), as shown in Figure 5a. The improvement demonstrates that integration of SiO2 at the rGE/silicone interface is suitable for adhesive applications.
As can be seen from Figure 5b, the black parts are the adhesive surfaces of the bonded
aluminum sheets after tensile shear tests. Further, lots of rGES-2/silicone
sample remained on the aluminum surfaces after tensile tear tests,
indicating that the adhesive forces between the aluminum sheets and
rGES/silicone are so strong that the fracture mainly happens in the
internal body of the adhesive materials. Therefore, rGES-2/silicone
with the best mechanical properties also shows the best adhesive improvement.
Besides metals, the excellent mechanical and adhesive properties of
rGES/silicone allow potential for bonding other kinds of materials,
such as ceramics, plastics, rubber, wood, and so forth. Furthermore,
the rGES/silicone matrixes are also promising for different kinds
of bonding materials and can even replace traditional connections,
such as welding, bolt connection, riveting, and so on.

matrixes as an adhesive: (a) tensile

2.3 Thermal
Stability
2.3.1 Thermal Characterization
Figure 6a,b gives the thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) and corresponding differential thermal analysis (DTA)
curves of methyl vinyl polysiloxane matrixes reinforced by 10 wt %
of different nanofillers under a N2 atmosphere. The main
decomposition process of pure methyl vinyl polysiloxane takes place
in the temperature range of 400–560 °C, resulting from
the removal of some alkyl functional groups such as methyl and vinyl,
as well as the skeleton of polysiloxane. Specifically, the 5% weight
loss temperature for blank SR is 422 °C, which increases to 426,
440, and 446 °C after incorporation of rGE, rGES-1, and rGES-2,
respectively. Analogously, the 50% weight loss temperature for blank
SR is 543 °C, which increases to 557, 635, and 638 °C for
rGE/SR, rGES-1/SR, and rGES-2/SR, respectively. Moreover, the maximum
weight loss temperature for blank SR is 553 °C, which increases
to 587, 661, and 665 °C for rGE/SR, rGES-1/SR, and rGES-2/SR,
respectively. The enhanced thermal stability is considered to be firstly
due to the physical barrier effect of rGE,59 just like other layered materials such as layered double hydroxides60 and clay,61 which
slows down the escape of pyrolysis products. The second important
reason can be attributed to the effective combination of rGE and polysiloxane
through the buffer layer SiO2, which plays an important
role in regulating the incongruity at the rigid–flexible interface.

stability of SR composites reinforced by (a, b) different
nanofillers at the ratio of 10 wt % and (c, d) rGES-2 with different
feeding ratios.

Figure 6c,d shows
the TGA and corresponding DTA curves of polysiloxane matrixes reinforced
by rGES-2 (rGE/SiO2 = 1:5, w/w) with the filling ratios
of 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 wt %. The 5% weight loss temperature increased
from 422 °C for the bare sample to 436, 432, 431, 426, and 447
°C for the filling ratios of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 wt %, respectively.
Similarly, an increase in decomposition temperature is also observed
for the 50% weight loss, from 543 to 647, 640, 648, 643, and 645 °C
for a filling ratio from 0 to 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 wt %, respectively.
The 50 wt % weight loss temperature of the SR composites increased
by more than 100 °C, no matter how much the filler amount was.
Moreover, the maximum weight loss temperature of blank SR is 553 °C,
which increased to 665, 656, 662, 656, and 658 °C for the filler
ratios from 0 to 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 wt %, respectively. The maximum
decomposition temperature of the SR composites also exceeded more
than 100 °C over that of the unfilled one. Compared with covalent-functionalized
rGE, the increasing extent of nanomodified rGE on the thermal stability
of the polymer is competitive,62 indicating
the efficiency of this method.

The initial and maximum decomposition
temperatures of the polysiloxane
matrix enhanced by different nanofillers with various filling ratios
were tested and analyzed in detail, and the corresponding results
are shown in Figure 7a,b, respectively. Figure 7a shows the initial decomposition temperature of bare SR is
514 °C, which increases to an average value (average of 5 filling
ratios: 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 wt %) of 544, 614, and 642 °C for SiO2/SR, rGES-1/SR, and rGES-2/SR, respectively. Compared with
that of the unfilled SR, precipitated SiO2/SR shows an
increase in temperature of 30 °C. However, this value is surpassed
by rGES/SR (ranging from 100 to 128 °C over that of the bare
one), which shows better thermal stability. Among them, the initial
decomposition temperature of only 5 wt %
rGES-2 filled SR (0.5 wt % rGE) increased as high as 98 and 288 °C
above that of the SiO2 and rGE filled ones, respectively.

Figure 7 (a) Initial
and (b) maximum decomposition temperature of polysiloxane
composites as a function of filler percent.

As is well known, the compatibility between SiO2 and
SR is better than that between rGE and SR composites. The degree of
dispersion for SiO2 and rGES incorporated SR composites
is therefore better than that for rGE incorporated SR composites,
as shown in the SEM images. As a result, the status for every microscopic
region of SiO2 and rGES incorporated SR composite tends
to be consistent, and the decomposition temperatures remain nearly
constant when the filler contents reach to more than 10 wt %. However,
the status or dispersion of rGE incorporated SR at the microscale
is irregular, unstable, and less uniform, so the decomposition temperatures
for rGE incorporated SR composites fluctuated significantly.

Figure 7b shows
that the maximum decomposition temperature of bare SR is 553 °C,
which increases to an average value (average of 5 filling ratios:
5, 10, 20, 30, 40 wt %) of 583, 635, 660, and 666 °C for SiO2/SR, rGE/SR, rGES-1/SR, and rGES-2/SR, respectively. Compared
with that of the bare one, precipitated SiO2/SR and rGE/SR
show increased maximum decomposition temperatures by 30 and 82 °C,
respectively. However, both these values are exceeded by rGES-1/SR
and rGES-2/SR (107 and 113 °C over that of the bare one, respectively).
From the results it can be seen that both the initial and maximum
decomposition temperatures of rGES/SR show more obvious increases
than that of rGE/SR and SiO2/SR; rGES can be considered
as a better heat stabilizer than conventional fillers.

2.3.2 Mechanism of Thermal Stability Enhancement
Generally,
the activity and mobility of polymer molecules increase
as the temperature rises; the functional groups and skeleton of polysiloxane
begin to expand and decompose when absorbing enough activation energy.
The added rGE provides certain steric hindrance to the expansion of
polysiloxane molecules and can slightly increase the system’s
thermal stability. However, the potential of rGE has not been fully
released due to poor dispersion and an unstable interface. By integration
of a SiO2 buffer layer between rGE and polysiloxane, thinner
and better dispersion of rGE in polysiloxane is achieved. rGES can
be considered as fragmented rGE, somewhat, by SiO2 nanoparticles,
which helps to adjust the rigidity of rGE to adapt to flexible polysiloxane
molecules. The unstable rGE/polysiloxane interface translates into
compatible SiO2/polysiloxane and rGE/SiO2 interfaces,
which can then adapt to outside changes. Therefore, the sheet surface
behavior of rGES in polysiloxane is much closer to the situation of
SiO2. The
steric hindrance of rGE on expansion of polysiloxane molecules is
better controlled through the SiO2 buffer layer. As a result,
the rGES-filled polysiloxane system shows better thermal stability
than the rGE filled one.

3 Conclusions
A rigid–flexible rGE/silicone interface was successfully
built by embedding inorganic nanoSiO2, which produced a
subtle buffer effect in the rGE/silicone matrix. The compatibility
and dispersion between rGE and silicone are greatly improved, leading
to better mechanical and thermal performances. The performance enhancement
is mainly attributed to the modified interface and improved interfacial
interaction between rGE and silicone. The constructed rGES/silicone
matrixes show potential application in adhesives. Compared with the
traditional covalent functionalization method, the strategy adopted
has shown a more obvious enhancing effect. Besides, our method is
an easy batch preparation, highly efficient and quantifiable, which
is of important theoretical significance. Moreover, the strategy is
also a good choice for other kinds of materials when strong interfacial
interactions are in great demand or a solvent-free green blending
process is needed, showing a wide potential in both laboratory and
industrial applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Fabrication of rGES
Graphite oxide
(GO) was prepared using graphite (500 mesh) according to the literature
Hummers method.63 GO (5 g) was ultrasonicated
(600 W, Kunshan Ultrasonic Instrument Co., Ltd., China) to form a
partly exfoliated graphene oxide dispersion; hydrazine hydrate (AR.,
6.25 mL) and a suitable amount of ammonia were added to the dispersion
and the temperature was increased to 100 °C, refluxing and stirring
for 3 h to prepare rGE. The dispersion color changed from yellow to
dark and a weight of 3.75 g was obtained by filtration. Then rGE and
tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) were chosen as precursors to produce
rGES as follows. First, rGE (5 g) was dispersed in ethanol/distilled
water mixed solvents (5 L, volume ratio 1:10) under ultrasonication
for 1 h. Then, the dispersion was transferred to a flask (10 L), TEOS
(167 mL, CP) was added into the dispersion and the mixture was kept
stirring for 1 h. Second, ammonia (AR.) was slowly dropped into the
mixture until the pH reached 9, the mixture was kept reacting for
1 h at room temperature. Lastly, the mixed solvents were removed by
vacuum distillation first (75 °C), followed by vacuum drying
(80 °C) in an oven, the product was weighed as 29.31 g. Accordingly,
the mass ratio of rGE and SiO2 in rGES was calculated approximately
to be 1:10, ignoring the sample loss during the product collection
process. The product was named rGES-1. The above process can be adjusted
to prepare rGES-2 when changing the volume ratio of ethanol/water
to 10:1. Also, rGES-1 and rGES-2 with lower SiO2 content
(rGE/SiO2 = 1:5) can be fabricated by replacing 167 mL
of TEOS with 93 mL of TEOS when the total volume is kept unchanged.
In the following text, rGES-1 and rGES-2 mean the situation of rGE/SiO2 = 1:10 if there is no special note. Also, commercialized
graphene (Ningbo Morsh Technology Co., Ltd., R&D by Institute
of Materials Technology and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences,
China), which is prepared through the physical exfoliation of graphite,
was also used to prepare rGES using the same route as chemically rGE.

4.2 Fabrication of rGES/Silicone-Based Composites
Methyl vinyl polysiloxane (Mw = 610 000,
vinyl content = 0.16% mol) was chosen as the silicone substrate. The
fabrication processes of the rGE/SR composites are as follows (Scheme S4). Methyl vinyl polysiloxane (100 g),
rGES (0, 5, 10, 20, 30, or 40 g), hydroxy silicone oil (10 wt % of
the rGES weight), and zinc stearate (CP, 0.1 g) were mixed on a SK-160
double roll open plastomil (Shanghai wings rubber machinery Co., Ltd,
China) until the constituents were uniformly dispersed. The mixture
was put into a 150 °C vacuum oven for 4 h and taken out to allow
to cool before antirefining with 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(tert-butylperoxy)hexane (1 g) on the SK-160 double roll open plastomil
again. Then, the mixture was transferred to a 11.5 × 11.5 ×
0.25 cm3 mold and vulcanized for 10 min (170 °C, 14.5
MPa) on a QLB-50 vulcanizing machine (Shanghai wings rubber machinery
Co., Ltd, China). Lastly, the sample was put into a blast oven for
depth curing at 200 °C for 4 h and cut into strips before mechanical
tests.

4.3 Material Characterizations
Morphological
analyses of samples were carried out on an H-7650 TEM (Hitachi, Japan)
and an SEMS-3000 N SEM (Hitachi, Japan). Field emission scanning electron
microscopy images were recorded on an S-4800 FE-SEM (Hitachi, Japan).
Powder XRD analyses were carried out using a Thermo ARL X’
TRA with Cu Kα radiation (l = 1.5406 Å).
FT-IR was performed with a Nicolet 7000 using KBr pellets. Shore A
hardness was tested on LX-A Shore hardness equipment for rubber (Jiangdu
Zhenwei test machine Co., Ltd, China). Thickness was tested on a WHT-10A
rubber/plastic instrument (Jiangdu test machine, China). Mechanical
testing was performed using a universal testing machine (Gotech Testing
Machines Co. Ltd). Tensile strength and elongation at break data were
collected referring to a GB/T528-1998 standard, tear strength values
were measured according to a GB/T529-1999 standard, and tensile shear
adhesive strength data were measured referring to a standard of GB/T7124-2008.
TGA and DTA data were recorded on a TG209C thermogravimetric analyzer
(Netzsch, Germany) from room temperature to 800 °C (10 °C/min,
N2 protection).
