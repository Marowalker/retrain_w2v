The structure and dynamics of the solvation of several
alkali metal
halides in an ionic liquid (IL), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate
([BMIm][OTf]), were investigated by classical molecular dynamics simulations.
Various properties such as density, radial distribution functions,
coordination numbers, spatial distribution functions, mean-square
displacements, self-diffusion coefficients, and velocity–velocity
autocorrelation functions were calculated to understand the solvation
environment of alkali metal halide salts in IL at various salt concentrations.
We observe that the halide anions are coordinated in two different
ways with [BMIm]+ in all of the mixtures. However, the
alkali metal cations interact more with the anion of the ionic liquid
as we go from fluorides to iodides. When a common anion was used for
the salt and the ionic liquid, we observe significant coordination
of Na+ with the anion of the ionic liquid in two different
ways, which was not observed in the case of lithium salt. We also
find that the Li+ and Na+ ions are involved
in the formation of a aggregate-like, stable kinetic entity with anions in their first
solvation shells. These aggregate-like entities were seen to be relatively
stable, and we noted a rattling motion of salt ions inside them.

Introduction
Room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs)
have a melting point usually
below 100 °C and consist of an organic cation and an inorganic
anion.1,2 The ILs are thermally and electrochemically
stable, inflammable, capable of dissolving many organic and inorganic
salts, and have a low vapor pressure as well as viscosity. Due to
high ionic conductivity, they have gathered much attention in the
field of electrochemistry as well.3,4 These also
become highly attractive alternative candidates for replacing traditional
organic solvents in various applications in industries.2,5−9 The applications of ionic liquids are also found in fields of cutting-edge
research like drug delivery; when ILs interact with drug moieties and proteins, ions present in
the vicinity of the biomolecules often play an important role in determining
the nature of the entire system.10−12,34,35 The mixtures of ILs with alkali
metal salts have been used in several potential applications. Due
to the capability of the ILs to process metals, the area of ionometallurgy
is attractive especially because of the redox properties13 of salts dissolved in them. The process of metal
extraction from aqueous solutions using ILs having different positive
and negative ions has been reported earlier.14,15 Other methods involve solvents generally made up of a combination
of hydrogen donors and quaternary ammonium salts, known as deep eutectic
solvents, used for metal extraction from complicated matrices and
metal salts.16−20 For the separation processes of metal ions, a considerable range
of ILs are used.14 ILs produce solutions
that are entirely different from those prepared from aqueous or organic
solvents21 and facilitate the extraction
of charged species. Another advantage is the applicability of ion
exchange mechanisms to transfer ions,22 which makes the extraction process more easier.

Many research
groups around the world have examined the extraction
of metals using ionic liquids and the transport of metals in ionic
liquid solvents. The anions in the ionic liquid affect the solubility
of most of the metal salts. A study proved that imidazolium-based
ILs containing nonafluorobutanesulfonate ([NfO]−) showed excellent capability of metal extraction from an aqueous
solution.14 ILs based on imidazolium cations
are better for solvation than their ammonium, pyridinium, and phosphonium
counterparts for extraction of metals.22 The metal salts were found to be sparingly soluble in imidazolium-based
ionic liquids without a common anion.23 Pereiro et al. reported that lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide
(LiNTf2) salt was more soluble than NaNTf2 in
1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, [C2C1Im][NTf2].24 However, these solutions are prone to form [Li(NTf2)2]− anionic
clusters, as reported by Lassègues et al.25 and also supported by Umebayashi et al.,26 who observed the solvation of the lithium salt in two different
ionic liquids, [Emim][NTf2] and N-butyl-N-methyl pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide,
[BMPy][NTf2]. Méndez-Morales et al.27 studied the solvation structure of alkaline salts mixed
with imidazolium-based ILs with common anions using molecular dynamics
simulations. They observed the formation of stable clusters of the
alkaline metal cations (M+) with IL anions. They found
a linearly increasing trend in the density of all mixtures of the
IL and salt. The same group also studied the solvation of lithium
salts in protic ILs with a common anion using molecular dynamics28 and reported the solvation structure of Li+ cations in the hydrogen-bonded and amphiphilically nanostructured
environment. Kuzmina et al.29 performed
the experimental study to find the solubility of alkali metal halides
(MXs) in an IL, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate
([BMIm][OTf]). They also investigated the effects of common anions
on the solubilities of salts in the IL. The difference in the solubility
of salts with a common anion compared to halide salts is found to
be meager. They provided the schematic representation of the solvation
of salt within the IL “cage”; however, the study could
not provide the detailed atomistic-level interactions between the
solute and solvent. Recently, a study has been reported on the behavior
of mono-, di-, and trivalent metal cations relevant to electrodeposition
in IL mixtures.30 Several studies have
been reported in the literature for the solvation of divalent and
trivalent cations in the bulk and at interfaces. The ionic liquid–metal
salt mixtures were also used for the electrochemical applications.
The solvated higher-valence salts like Mg or Al in IL solutions may
facilitate the development of more efficient energy storage systems.31 Gómez-González et al. reported
the structure and spectral properties of protic and aprotic ILs with
magnesium and calcium salts.32 A molecular
dynamics study of mixtures of IL and magnesium tetrafluroborate confined
between two parallel graphene plates was also reported.33

The dynamics of the ions of metal salts
in an ionic liquid environment
has not been explored by the scientific community in detail. The knowledge
of the solvation characteristics of these salts in IL may prove to
be useful information while employing ionic liquids for extraction
of metals from their ores. Thus, to get a better understanding of
the solvation structure of MX (M = metal cation and X = halide) in
the IL, we investigated the mixture of [BMIm][OTf] with various halide
salts with the help of classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
In this study, we calculated structural properties such as radial
distribution functions (RDFs), spatial distribution functions (SDFs),
and coordination numbers and dynamical properties such as mean-square
displacements (MSDs) and velocity–velocity autocorrelation
functions. Here, we investigated the solvation of ions, atomistic
details of the interactions, possible rattling motion of ions, and
formation of cagelike structures, which can affect the diffusivity
of constituent ionic entities (Figure 1 and Table 1).

Results and Discussion
We systematically studied the
pure IL and its mixture with alkali
halides (MXs) employing classical molecular dynamics simulations;
M = lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, and cesium cations and X
= fluoride, chloride, bromide, and iodide anions. We compared the
densities obtained through our MD simulations with experimental values
available in the literature to validate the force fields employed.
The estimated density of pure IL (1302 kg m–3) shows
an excellent agreement with the experimental density (1304 kg m–3). We present the densities of all simulated MX +
IL mixtures in Figure 2a. Cations like Rb+ and Cs+ are heavier than
[BMIm]+. When salts containing these are taken at higher
concentrations, the overall mass of the system increases, which in
turn leads to increase in density. This effect is observed in the
figure, for 25 and 50% mole fractions of the salt. For lighter M+-containing systems, the density decreases with the increasing
concentration. For lithium and sodium salts with a common anion, we
found a linearly increasing trend of density (Figure 2b) with the increase of salt concentration
due to the smaller size and higher charge densities of both Li+ and Na+ than [BMIm]+. The same trend
was also reported by Méndez-Morales et al.28 in their study of solvation of the lithium salt in a protic
ionic liquid with a common anion.

of LiCl (black circle), NaCl (red square), KCl (green diamond), RbCl
(blue triangle), and CsCl (magenta triangle) and (b) Li[OTf] (violet

(black triangle) and simulated density (red triangle) of pure IL are
also included.

Structure and Dynamics of Pure Ionic Liquid
We calculated
the radial distribution functions34 (RDFs)
of various pairs taking the last trajectories obtained from the NVE
simulation to know the microstructure of the pure IL. RDF gives the
probability of finding an atom/molecule around a reference atom/molecule.
We calculated the following RDFs: cation–anion (Figure 3a), cation–cation, and
anion–anion taking the center of mass of each (Figure S1), between the hydrogen atoms on the
ring of [BMIm]+ and the oxygen atom of [OTf]− (Figure 3b). In the
case of cation–anion RDF, the peak height is greater compared
to that in cation–cation and anion–anion RDFs. In the
case of atom–atom RDFs, we observe that the oxygen atom of
[OTf]− interacts more strongly with H3 as compared
to H1 and H2 of [BMIm]+ due to two electronegative nitrogen
atoms attached to C3. These atoms pull electron density toward them,
making C3, and consequently H3, more electron-deficient, resulting
in oxygen attraction. As evident from Figure 3, the first peaks for cation–cation,
cation–anion, and anion–anion appear at 8, 5.1, and
8.9 Å, respectively. [BMIm]+ is surrounded by [OTf]− in its first solvation shell and a second layer of
[BMIm]+ in the second solvation shell and vice versa. We
observe splitting of peak in anion–anion RDF due to sequential
ordering induced by cation–anion pairs, similar to the observation
by Morrow et al.35 We calculated average
coordination numbers by integrating the radial distribution function
ranging from zero to the distance of first minimum of corresponding
RDF. We observe that the average numbers of [OTf]− and [BMIm]+ around [BMIm]+ are ∼7.12
and ∼21.90, respectively. Similarly, one [OTf]− is surrounded by around 7 [BMIm]+ in the first solvation
shell and 17 [OTf]− in the second solvation shell.
To get a three-dimensional picture of this scenario, we analyzed the
spatial distribution functions (SDFs) with isosurface density value
(number of atoms/nm3) 10 using the TRAVIS36 software package. We can see from Figure 3c,d that the anions are more distributed
around the [BMIm]+ and the cations are distributed around
oxygen atoms of [OTf]−.

(a) [BMIm]+ around OTf and (b)

atoms of [BMIm]+. Spatial distributions of (c) [BMIm]+ (blue) around [OTf]− and (d) [OTf]− (red) around [BMIm]+.

To study the dynamics of cations and anions of
pure IL, we illustrated
the mean-square displacement (MSD) of [BMIm]+ and [OTf]− (Figure 4), which is defined as 1  where the location of the center of mass of
ion i at time t is given by r⃗(t); the sum extends over all
of the species, and the brackets indicate the ensemble average. The
MSD of the cation is more than that of the anion, which can be attributed
to the lighter mass of the cations. We calculated self-diffusion coefficients
of the cation and anion using the Einstein relation37 2  The diffusive regime exists where the ratio(β)
of the log MSD and log t plot is equal
to 1. This was calculated using the following equation, and the results
are presented in Figure 4b,c. 3  We fitted the MSD between 20 and 46 ns (identified
as the diffusive regime) to calculate the diffusion coefficients.
The values of diffusion coefficient of [BMIm]+ and [OTf]− are 4.3 × 10–12 and 2.5 ×
10–12 m2 s–1, respectively.
The diffusion coefficient obtained for [BMIm]+ is in the
same range as reported by Morrow and Maginn35 for the IL, [BMIm][PF6], using the CHARMM force field.
Another report in the literature by Tsuzuki et al. provided the experimental
diffusion coefficients of [BMIm]+ and [OTf]− to be 10 × 10–11 and 9.0 × 10–11, respectively, at a temperature of 353 K, while molecular dynamics
simulations at the same temperature reported 5.9 × 10–12 and 4.8 × 10–12 for [BMIm]+ and
[OTf]−,38 respectively.

Structure and Dynamics of Mixtures of Ionic Liquid and Alkali
Metal Salts at Different Concentrations
We present the snapshots
of the solvation shell of lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, and
cesium cations in the mixtures of single ion pair of metal chlorides
(MCl) with the IL to understand the structural characteristics (Figure S2). We find that all M+ are
surrounded by nearly 4 [OTf]− and coordinate through
nearly 7 oxygen atoms. On analysis of RDFs of [OTf]− around M+ (Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs) (Figure S3), we observe that the first peak heights of the
RDFs of [OTf]− around M+ decrease when
the size of M+ increases, in all of the mixtures. We know
that a higher charge density facilitates the coordination with anions.
The first solvation shell regions appear at farther distances when
we move from Na to Cs due to increasing size of M+. However,
as the size of X– increases, we observe that the
interactions between M+ and [OTf]− also
grow stronger. This can point to a decreasing interaction between
the M+ and X–, leading to solvation of
the cation by ionic liquid anions. This observation is in accordance
with an experimental study of solubility of MX in [BMIm][OTf] conducted
by Kuzmina et al.,29 wherein they reported
an increasing trend of solubilities with an increase in the size of
X–, based on the calculation of thermodynamic parameters
such as ΔH, ΔS, and
ΔG. Looking at the distribution of [BMIm]+ around X–, we observe a peak splitting
within the first solvation shell of X– (Figure 5) in all of the mixtures.
This splitting is indicative of two different types of binding of
[BMIm]+ with X–. The first peak is more
intense than the second peak, and it represents the interaction between
X– and the H3 atom of the [BMIm]+. The
second peak represents the interaction between MX and H1, H2 atoms
of [BMIm]+. Coordination numbers corresponding to the RDFs
point out that M+ is surrounded by 4–5 [OTf]−. The number of [BMIm]+ surrounding X– is seen to be in the range of 3–7. For different
concentrations of alkali metal chlorides (MCl) in IL (Figure 6), Li+ shows much
stronger attractions to [OTf]− than the rest in
all mixtures. This shows that Li+ is more solvated by [OTf]− and hence is more soluble in solutions.29 However, Cs+ is observed to be less
solvated than its counterparts and is also least soluble. We also
see a very tiny shoulder around first peak of RDF in the case of Na+, which vanishes at higher concentrations of salt. This shoulder
is also indicative of two different types of binding of the Na+ with [OTf]−, which is not observed at higher
concentrations of salt. In the right-hand-side column of Figure 6, we observe two
peaks in the first solvation shell of Cl–, which
represent two types of binding environments of Cl– with [BMIm]+. The first type of binding occurs at a closer
distance and is stronger, so this is between Cl– and H3 atoms of [BMIm]+. The second type is the coordination
between Cl– and the other hydrogen atoms of [BMIm]+. These peak heights decrease at higher concentrations of
salt, which implies a decrease in the Cl––[BMIm]+ interactions. The second peak nearly vanishes at higher concentrations.
For a clearer picture of the structural environment of the solvation
shell of M+ and Cl–, we calculated coordination
numbers (Figure S4). The relative numbers
of [OTf]− around M+ and [BMIm]+ around Cl– decrease when we go toward a higher
percentage of salt because of the more significant number of salt
molecules. From these results, we can say that M+ is surrounded
by Cl– and [OTf]− in their first
solvation shell and further surrounded by [BMIm]+ in the
second solvation shell. Cl– is surrounded by the
first layer of M+, the second layer of [BMIm]+, and the third layer of Cl– and [OTf]−.

25%
and (e, f) 50% concentration of salt in IL. Black, red, green, blue,
and magenta represent the mixture of LiCl, NaCl, KCl, RbCl, and CsCl
in IL, respectively.

To know how M+ moves through its solvation
shells, we
calculated the mean-square displacements of the single ionic species
of salts (Figure S5). We find that Na+ covers very less displacement in a mixture of its fluoride
or chloride with the IL. The contrary is observed when its bromide
or iodide is used due to the larger sizes of Br– and I–. We show log–log plot of MSD and
β values in Figures S6 and S7, respectively.
Since the simulation time required for these systems to reach a proper
diffusive regime (β = 1) is quite long, we calculated self-diffusion
coefficients from the MSDs, where the values of β are in the
range of 0.8–1 (corresponding to the simulation time of 4–20
ns) (Figure 7). For
anions, F– and I–, K+ shows the largest self-diffusion coefficient among the cations.
The larger cations Cs+ and Rb+ show faster diffusion
for Cl– and Br– as counter ions,
respectively. Na+ is involved in relatively slower motion
when the anions are smaller (F– or Cl–) but moves substantially faster for Br– or I–. Hence, it can be seen that the choice of X– also plays a role in determining the diffusion characteristics of
M+.

Figure 7 Self-diffusion coefficients for M+ and X– in mixtures of single ion pair of MX in IL.

For a better understanding, we also calculated
velocity autocorrelation
functions of all single ionic species of MCl. Velocity autocorrelation
provides essential information about single-particle dynamics; the
profile of the curve that resembles that of a damped oscillator points
to the fact that there are strong interactions that act on the ions.
The ions that try to stabilize between attractive and repulsive forces
are also involved in diffusive motion. This diffusion forms one of
the primary reasons for the dampening of oscillatory characteristics.
The first zero of this curve provides the first collision time, the
average time a particle takes to collide with another particle. A
longer collision time is indicative of slower transport dynamics of
the ion due to the mass of the ion and its charge density. Normalized
velocity autocorrelation functions, C(t), for the M+ and Cl– are represented
in Figure 8 and were
calculated using the following equation 4  where the velocity of the center-of-mass of
the ions at time t is represented by v⃗(t) and the brackets indicate the ensemble average. The insets
in Figure 8 indicate
the estimation of the corresponding collision time. The scaled inset
shows the time at which the curves meet the x-axis.
We observe that the oscillatory behavior completely vanishes for the
mixtures of RbCl and CsCl due to their large size. This relatively
faster damping is indicative of weaker interactions acting on these
larger cations. Collision times increase as we move from Li+ to Cs+ due to combined effects of the decreasing interaction
between M+ and [OTf]− and increase in
the size of the cations. A slight decrease in collision time occurs
for the larger M+, as the concentration of salt increases.
However, the changes in collision time with respect to the changes
in the concentration of salt are negligible, and the concentration
of salt does not have a huge impact on these values. Li+ and Na+ are found to have a stronger interaction with
[OTf]− at a shorter distance. The number of collisions
increases, and oscillatory behavior is seen up to nearly 0.6 and 0.3
ps for Li+ and Na+, respectively. These collision
times imply a rattling motion of ions in the mixture. Table 2 summarizes the collision times
for alkali metal chlorides at different concentrations. For more clarity,
we look at the MSD of M+ and Cl– with
respect to change in concentration (Figure S8). We also included the MSD for [BMIm]+ and [OTf]− (Figure S9). We see that
the MSD of Rb+ is more in the mixtures of 10 and 25% of
salt concentration. All M+, in general, traversed much
lesser (0.4–0.5 nm) at higher concentrations (50%) of salt,
and this is due to the high viscosity of the high-concentration solution.
We calculated the self-diffusion coefficients (Figure 9) of ions of salt by fitting our MSDs in
the range of 5–20 ns for M+ and X– and 10–40 ns for [BMIm]+ and [OTf]−, where values of β were close to unity. We observe a lowering
of diffusion coefficients of M+ when we go for a higher
concentration of salt due to increased viscosity. We find the same
order of self-diffusion coefficients for M+ in the mixtures
of 10 and 25% salt with IL: Li+ ≤ Na+ < K+ < Cs+ < Rb+. This
can be explained on the basis of the size of M+; since
Li+ and Na+ have smaller sizes and higher charge densities,
they can solvate more number of anions and become more structured
and less diffusive. Moreover, we find very similar diffusion coefficients
for all M+ in the mixture of 50% salt with the IL.

Mixtures of Lithium and Sodium Salts with Ionic Liquid with
a Common Anion
RDF peak heights in Figure 10 show that Li+ is much more interactive
toward the anion of IL as compared to Na+. There is a double
peak within the distance of first solvation shell of Na+ in the mixture of Na[OTf] in IL. Here, the first peak is more intense
when the concentration of salt is 5–15%, after which the second
peak becomes more intense. This result reveals that the strong coordination
of Na+ with the anion of IL is found to be at lower distances
till 15% of salt concentration and at higher distances after that.
The first and second peaks were found to be at 0.37 and 0.41 nm, respectively.
We also included the RDFs of [BMIm]+ and M+ around
M+ (Figure S10). Li+ and Na+ show much stronger coordination with the [OTf]− than with other two species. We did not find any significant
changes in the structure of the IL. We estimated the coordination
numbers of different species around Li+ (Figure S13a) and Na+ (Figure S13b). We also include the number of surrounding [OTf]− around [BMIm]+ of IL anions in the same
graph. We found an increasing trend in the number of [OTf]− around Li+ and Na+ with an increase in the
concentration of salt. We also found that the number of M+ around itself was increasing from lower to a higher concentration
of salt. We observed that nearly 4 [OTf]− were found
in their first coordination shells. From these results, we can predict
that the Li+ and Na+ are surrounded by a first
layer of [OTf]−, the second layer of itself in their
first solvation shell, and a third layer of [BMIm]+ in
the second solvation shell.

Li+ and (b) [OTf]− around Na+. The insets show magnified images of the peaks.

We also investigated the concentration dependence
of normalized
velocity autocorrelation functions of Li+ and Na+ in the mixture of Li[OTf] and Na[OTf] in IL and is presented in Figure S12. We have included estimated collision
times for Li+ and Na+ in Table 3. A clear oscillatory behavior is seen for
Na+, and these oscillations are nearly damped out after
1.0 ps. This behavior indicated the rattling motion of Na+ in the “cage” of its nearest neighbors, which is in
agreement with previous studies of Li+ and Na+.27,39 Li+ has random collisions but
has a strong correlation up to nearly 1.0 ps because it has stronger
interaction with the IL anions in comparison to Na+. We
observe an increasing trend in the mean collision time of sodium (except
for 5 and 25% of salt), supportive of the fact that the interaction
between Na+ and [OTf]− decreases between
10 and 20% of salt concentration; we also suggest this type of behavior
from our structural analysis. The dynamics of Li+ and Na+ in their solvation shell is faster at lower salt concentrations.
For more details on the single-particle dynamics, we analyzed the
MSDs of Li+ and Na+ (Figure S13) for all of the systems. From this, we observed that Li+ and Na+ are displaced more at lower concentrations
and much lesser at higher concentrations of salt. We included their
log–log plots (Figure S14) and β
values (Figure S15) of their corresponding
MSDs. To calculate the self-diffusion coefficients included in Tables 4 and 5, we fitted our MSDs in the ranges of 10–25 ns for
M+, 10–35 ns for [BMIm]+, and 10–30
ns for [OTf]−, where the values of β are close
to unity.

From all of these results, we conclude that Li+ and
Na+ form a stable kinetic entity ([M(OTf)n]n−1, where n is the number of surrounding [OTf]− around M+, M = Li, Na) with strong aggregations with [OTf]− in their first solvation shell, which has a longer lifetime, with
a rattling motion in its solvation shell. This was also reported by
Méndez-Morales et al.,27 for Li+ and Na+ in a mixture of lithium/sodium salts with
different ILs. Moreover, these formations are supported by thermodynamic
parameters as well. A metathesis reaction of MCl with [BMIm][OTf]
to form M[OTf] and [BMIm]Cl is reported in the literature to have
a negative reaction enthalpy, especially when M = Li or Na, making
this a thermodynamically favorable process,29 and lithium salts are more solvable than the larger M+.

Computational Methods
All classical MD simulations
were performed using the GROMACS 5.0.440,41 package. Bonded
and nonbonded parameters for cations and anions
of the pure ionic liquid were generated using generalized amber force
fields (GAFF)42 and are presented in the Supporting Information document. Lennard-Jones
parameters for alkali metals and anions were taken from reported data
by Chen et al. for Na+, K+, Cs+,
and Cl–.43 To find the
stable ground-state structures of a single cation and anion of the
pure ionic liquid, geometry optimizations were done with the help
of Gaussian 0944 using density functional
theory at the B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p) level.45,46 Optimized ground-state structures of the cation and anion of pure
IL are given in Figure 1a with atom labels noted using visual molecular dynamics (VMD) software.47 Alkali metal cations and anions were modeled
as a single site of charges +1 and −1, respectively. Generation
of partial charges was done by Antechamber.48 Atomic partial charges in the force field parameters of the cation
and anion of pure IL were adjusted by a scaling factor of 0.8 to enhance
the dynamics, which will give a very good agreement with experimental
results. Initial structures for molecular dynamics simulations were
set up using Packmol,49 and the number
of chemical entities used in each system is described in Table 1. A snapshot of the
[BMIm]+ as well as [OTf]− ions and the
initial configuration of a system of pure ionic liquid are given in Figure 1a,b, respectively.

MD simulations of pure IL and its mixture with different MXs were
performed at a temperature of 298.15 K and pressure of 1 atm. The
particle-mesh Ewald (PME) method with a 0.1 nm grid searching and
cubic interpolation of order 4 was used for treating long-range electrostatic
interactions. Both Coulombic and van der Waals interactions were treated
with a cutoff of 1.2 nm. Initial configurations were relaxed using
the steepest descent algorithm50 for 105 steps. An annealing process of 2 ns was used for stepwise
heating and cooling to ensure thorough mixing of the system components.
All systems of pure IL, as well as its mixtures of salts, were equilibrated
in an isobaric–isothermal ensemble (NPT) for 10 ns followed
by a simulation time of 10 ns within a canonical ensemble (NVT). Equilibrium
densities of the systems were calculated after the NPT simulations,
and these values were used to obtain the length of simulation boxes
for subsequent simulations. Finally, a simulation of 50 ns was performed
within the microcanonical ensemble (NVE). The mixtures of single ion
pair of MX with IL were simulated for 100 ns in the NVE ensemble.
A time step of 2 fs was used in all of the simulations. Temperature
and pressure were controlled by the V-rescale thermostat51 and Berendsen barostat52 algorithms with coupling constants of 0.1 and 2.0 ps, respectively.
We applied periodic boundary conditions in all directions so that
our system behaves like an infinite system. Equations of motion were
integrated with the help of the Verlet algorithm.53 The LINCS algorithm54 was used
to constrain the bonds with hydrogen atoms. All coordinates were saved
at every 2 ps, and the trajectories obtained from the NVE simulation
were used for the analysis of various properties.

Conclusions
We performed MD simulations of pure ionic
liquid [BMIm][OTf], its
mixtures with different MXs and the mixtures containing a common anion.
We analyzed the structural and dynamical properties of the systems
at T = 298.15 K and P = 1 atm. We
calculated the density of the pure IL that showed an excellent agreement.
We also calculated densities for all other systems. The analysis of
the RDFs of the mixtures shows that the interactions between M+ and [OTf]− decrease from Li+ to Cs+, and stronger interactions between M+ and [OTf]− are found in the mixtures of MI with
IL. X– was found to be coordinated in two different
ways with the [BMIm]+ in all mixtures. We observed that
Na+ is coordinated at two different binding sites of [OTf]− in the case of the same anion, and the structure of
IL remained nearly the same upon addition of salt. M+ cations
are surrounded by nearly 4 [OTf]− in their first
solvation shell in the mixture of a single ion pair of MX in the IL
and nearly 2 [OTf]− in the mixtures of different
concentrations of MX in the IL. In mixtures with a common anion, i.e.,
M[OTf] in [BMIm][OTf], we find that Li+ and Na+ are surrounded by the first layer of [OTf]−. By
the study of velocity autocorrelation functions, we observe that the
Li+ shows a rattling motion in the mixtures of different
concentrations of LiCl in IL. We observed that Li+ and
Na+ form stable kinetic entities (Na[(OTf)n]n−1) with strong
aggregation with [OTf]−. They are also found to
possess a rattling motion in IL mixtures with a common anion. Calculated
self-diffusion coefficients predict that the mobility of all of the
ionic species decreases with increasing salt concentration in mixtures
of MX and IL with a common anion, pointing to the formation of the
stable clusters.
