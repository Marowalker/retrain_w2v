Pd/NbOPO4 multifunctional catalyst was prepared and
used for catalytic hydrotreatment upgrading of bio-oil, which was
obtained from low-temperature torrefaction (LTT) of pubescens and
contained mainly lignin oligomers. The upgrading temperatures were
investigated at 220–280 °C. Pd/NbOPO4 exhibited
good performance for the effective depolymerization of oligomers with
increasing temperature. It was revealed that both Brönsted
acid sites and Lewis acid sites existed on NbOx, which contributed to the cleavage of the C–O–C
bond. Furthermore, esterification, hydrogenation, and O-alkylation
of monomeric derivatives also occurred simultaneously during the depolymerization
process. After hydrotreatment upgrading, the average molecular weight
of bio-oil decreased from Mw = 320 Da
(Mn = 298 Da) to Mw = 273 Da (Mn = 254 Da) and the
bio-oil quality was improved dramatically. The oxygen content decreased
from 29.53 to 9.78 wt %. The upgraded bio-oil obtained at 280 °C
had a heating value of 40.48 MJ kg–1, which was
much higher than that of the original bio-oil (26.96 MJ kg–1).

1 Introduction
Biomass
has been viewed as an alternative resource of fossil fuel
and can be used to produce high-quality fuels and useful chemicals1−3 to overcome the rapid decrease of mineral resource. Pyrolysis is
one of the effective methods to convert the low-fuel-density biomass
to high-quality bio-oil. However, the bio-oil obtained from high-temperature
pyrolysis generally contains hundreds of compounds and a large amount
of oxygenated compounds, which results in undesirable properties such
as low thermal and chemical stability, low heating value, immiscibility
with the fossil fuels, and high acidity,4 thus making it difficult to be directly used. Therefore, several
kinds of strategies, including pretreatment of the raw biomass,5 upgrading of the bio-oil obtained,6 catalytic pyrolysis,7 etc., are used to improve the quality of bio-oil obtained. Among
them, pretreatment of raw biomass and upgrading of bio-oil are widely
used.

Torrefaction, carried out at a relatively lower temperature
than
that for pyrolysis,8 is generally used
to pretreat the raw biomass material to change its composition and
property and then to improve to a certain extent the quality of bio-oil
obtained from further pyrolytic conversion.9,10 Zheng
et al.11 studied the torrefaction effect
on pyrolysis and found the following enhancements of bio-oil obtained
after torrefaction: relatively low water content, slight increase
in pH, and obvious increase of heating value. Chen et al.12 also reported that torrefaction led to a decrease
in the water content of pyrolysis bio-oil, and the heating value increased
with lower acid content and higher phenol content. However, it is
interesting to note that low-temperature torrefaction (LTT) also produces
certain amount of bio-oil products composed of mainly oligomers,8 the utilization of which needs to be considered
to avoid waste of resource and prevent pollution.

The upgrading
of crude bio-oil and different model compounds of
bio-oil with various catalysts has been performed by catalytic cracking
and hydrogenation. Generally, catalytic cracking using zeolites (HZSM-5,
Al2O3-SiO2, SAPO-5, SAPO-11) and
some other compounds13,14 is being conducted under mild
pressure and at high temperatures (>400 °C) in the absence
of
hydrogen. Unfortunately, this process often suffers from severe coke
deposition and fast catalyst deactivation due to high-temperature
operation. Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is found to be an efficient catalytic
upgrading method, which can remove oxygen atoms in bio-oil via releasing
CO, CO2, and H2O in the presence of H2 over heterogeneous catalyst and then improve the quality and stability
of bio-oil.15 Heterogeneous catalysts generally
included noble metals (Pt, Pd, Ru), transition metals (Ni, Mo, Co,
W), and bimetallic catalysts (Pt–Pd, Rh–Pd, CuNi, NiMo,
NiW, NiCo, CoMo) among many others supported on various carriers,
such as Al2O3, ZrO2, TiO2, MgO, mesoporous zeolites, and activated carbons,13,16,17 which all showed excellent performance in
upgrading bio-oil. For example, sulfide CoMo/γ-Al2O3 and NiMo/γ-Al2O3 catalysts,
used for hydrodesulfurization (HDS) in conventional petroleum industry,
are applied in HDO to upgrade bio-oil and effectively avoid excessive
coking. Unfortunately, sulfide catalysts have disadvantages such as
contamination of the final products due to the introduction of sulfur
into the system.18,19 Furthermore, Al2O3 is also unsuitable for HDO because alumina supports tend
to be transformed into boehmite by crystallization in the presence
of water vapor at elevated temperature (140–380 °C)20 and then blocked the active sites. Generally,
despite being expensive, noble-metal catalysts exhibit higher activities
than non-noble-metal catalysts in HDO of bio-oil.21 Moreover, the acidity of supports on the catalysts is also
crucial to deoxygenation of bio-oil.22 Strong
acid sites are favorable for HDO via dehydration or ring-opening reaction,
and high Brönsted acid sites concentration on the solid acid
catalyst would benefit C–O bond cleavage reaction rate.23,24 Furthermore, to reduce the formation of coke and prolong the lifetime
of the catalyst, organic solvent was added to the bio-oil in HDO reaction.25,26 The solvent can not only facilitate the dissolution of relatively
high-molecular-weight reactants/intermediates but also act as a co-reactant,
stabilizing the products and sometimes the reaction system. Especially,
the use of ethanol as environmentally friendly solvent was widely
reported in the literature. Peng et al.27 reported that the contents of carboxylic acids can effectively be
reduced with ethanol as solvent. Oh et al.28 found that with a significant decrease of acidity, the heating value
of the bio-oil increased from 17.3 to 27.8 MJ kg–1. That is to say, ethanol is a good agent to decrease the content
of acids and produce esters by esterification under mild conditions.29

Because bio-oil has complicated compositions,
including hundreds
of compounds, most of which are oligomers, and hence the upgrading
is proved to be very difficult.30,31 However, the bio-oil
obtained from low-temperature torrefaction is relatively simple, upgrading
of which might provide clues for the upgrading of high-temperature
pyrolysis bio-oil. Nevertheless, the study of the upgrading of liquid
products from torrefaction pretreatment is rarely reported. The purpose
of this study is to upgrade the bio-oil obtained from the low-temperature
torrefaction (LTT) of pubescens with the mesoporous niobium phosphate-supported
Pd multifunctional catalyst and investigate the depolymerization of
oligomers in the hydrotreatment of bio-oil under mild conditions (220–280
°C and 500 psi hydrogen pressure) in alcohol in an attempt to
provide way to utilize raw biomass materials to their fullest, avoiding
the waste of raw biomass and preventing the possible pollution from
biomass conversion.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of the Catalysts
The textural properties
of niobium phosphate and Pd/NbOPO4 were measured by N2 adsorption. The adsorption–desorption
isotherms and pore size distribution are shown in Figure 1. Both samples exhibited representative
type IV isotherm, and it can be observed that the niobium phosphate
was a typical mesoporous material with hysteresis loops intermediated
between typical H1- and H2-type in the P/P0 range of 0.40–0.80.
It can be seen that the pore volume showed a little decrease after
Pd being supported, which indicated that the PdO particle was certainly
deposited in the channels and meanwhile the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface decreased from 267.62 to 204.54 m2 g–1 (Table S1).

Figure 1 N2 absorption–desorption isotherms and pore size
distribution of NbOPO4 and Pd/NbOPO4.

The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD)
patterns of samples are displayed
in Figure 2. It can
be seen that NbOPO4 only shows two board peaks at 15–40
and 40–60° and no diffraction lines of crystallized Nb2O5 or NbOPO4 were detected, indicating
the glassy nature of the mesoporous niobium phosphate. There was only
one diffuse diffraction peak at 33.5° ascribed to PdO (1, 0,
1) on Pd/NbOPO4, and no other apparent diffraction peaks
were seen, which indicated that the PdO particle was small. When the
catalyst was reduced, the diffraction peak for PdO disappeared, whereas
that for metal Pd appeared. However, after the catalyst was used,
the intensity of the peaks ascribed to Pd became higher, which indicated
that Pd particles aggregated after reaction.

(a) NbOPO4, (b) Pd/NbOPO4, (c) reduced Pd/NbOPO4, and (d) used Pd/NbOPO4.

The temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) profiles and the amounts of acid sites are shown in Figure 3 and Table 1, respectively. It can be seen
that the total desorption curves and fitted curves for different-strength
acid sites of the two samples exhibited similar shape (Figure S1). Pd/NbOPO4 showed a broad
peak from 100 to 600 °C centered at 190 °C, which indicated
that the surface acid strength has a wide distribution. Generally,
the ammonia desorption peak below 350 °C was attributed to weak
acid sites, whereas the part of temperature over 350 °C was attributed
to stronger acid sites.32 This illustrated
that there were mainly medium acid sites on the Pd/NbOPO4 catalysts. From Table 1, it can be observed that the total acidity of the Pd/NbOPO4 catalyst was 3.3 mmol NH3 g–1, lower
than 3.71 mmol NH3 g–1 for NbOPO4. The weak acid sites and medium acid sites increased from
0.46 to 0.60 mmol NH3 g–1 and 1.13 to
1.23 mmol NH3 g–1, respectively. The
results implied that the introduction of metal Pd on NbOPO4 support could increase the weak and medium acids but decrease the
amount of strong acids. The types of acids on mesoporous niobium phosphate
were identified by pyridine-Fourier transform infrared (Py-FTIR) (Figure 4). It can be seen
that the absorbance bands at 1540 and 1450 cm–1 were
the characteristic bands of Brönsted and Lewis acid sites,
respectively. The band at 1490 cm–1 could be attributed
to the adsorption of pyridine on both Brönsted and Lewis acid
sites. The Brönsted (derived from Nb–OH and P–OH
on the surface) and Lewis acid sites could be due to the presence
of a certain number of octahedra NbO6 and tetrahedra NbO4 in the mesoporous niobium phosphate frameworks.33−35 Furthermore, the spectrum of different-temperature-evacuated samples
also certified the fact that mesoporous niobium phosphate has more
strong acid sites (Brönsted and Lewis acid sites).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) results of the surface species
on Pd/NbOPO4 catalyst before and after reaction (upgrading
temperature, 260 °C) are shown in Figure 5. For Pd/NbOPO4, the peaks corresponding
to Pd (3d5/2,3/2) at 336.6 and 341.86 eV can
be assigned to Pd2+ and those at 337.7 and 342.96 eV can
be attributed to Pd4+ after calcination.36 This implied that PdO was the primary oxidation state of
Pd/NbOPO4. After hydrotreating reaction, the Pd (3d5/2,3/2) peaks at 334.76 and 340.06 eV can be ascribed
to Pd0 37 and those at
336.6 and 341.86 eV can be attributed to Pd2+. It indicated
that Pd2+ was clearly reduced after reaction and that Pd0 was the predominant species with a small amount of Pd2+ possibly due to the oxidation by air in the transfer process.

2.2 Properties of Upgraded Bio-oil (UBO)
2.2.1 Analysis of Elemental Composition
The effects of hydrotreating
temperature were investigated in the
range of 220–280 °C with the same reaction time of 8 h. Table 2 shows the yields
of upgraded bio-oil and the corresponding content of organic elements.
A small part of volatile products could be evaporated with ethanol,
resulting in lower yield of bio-oil. The yield of bio-oil decreased
with increasing temperature. However, the yield suddenly increased
at 280 °C, which might be due to the fact that more ethanol reacted
with small molecular compounds via different reactions such as etherification,
which happened under all reaction conditions, and the tendency was
more enhanced with elevated temperature. Furthermore, while using
the support NbOPO4 as catalyst, there existed more insoluble
compounds in solvents, which might be due to the repolymerization
catalyzed by strong acid sites of supports, and lower yield was obtained.
It implied that the loading of palladium not only provided active
metal for hydrogenation, but also adjusted the acidity of the catalyst
and then avoided repolymerization in the hydrotreating process. According
to the literature,38−40 several possible reactions are shown in Scheme 1. The contents quantified
by gas chromatography (GC) of parts of low-molecular-weight products
obtained from hydrotreatment of bio-oil in ethanol are shown in Table S2. There were many unidentified peaks
on the GC; however, because of the lack of standard sample, they were
not quantified. The gas products were mainly CO, CO2, CH4, and C2H6, which may come from the
organic acids through decarboxylation and aldehydes through decarboxylation
and decarbonylation, as well as −OCH3 of methoxy
phenol through demethylation.41 The carbon
content of UBO ranged from 61.19 to 79.09 wt % by catalytic HDO, and
the hydrogen content also apparently increased from 7.98 to 10.73
wt %, which implied that more stable C–H bonds were formed.15 Furthermore, the oxygen level was much lower
than that of the initial bio-oil, demonstrating that oxygen was effectively
removed. The atomic H/C and O/C ratios were important characters to
evaluate the degree of deoxygenation and provide some information
about the aromatic content of bio-oils, respectively.42 The atomic O/C ratio was effectively reduced from 0.36
in CBO to 0.09 in UBO obtained at 280 °C. Furthermore, the supports
also showed excellent performance on the CBO upgrading and the carbon
and hydrogen content in UBO reached 75.25 and 9.11%, respectively.
The nitrogen and sulfur contents in the UBO also decreased, indicating
that HDN and HDS simultaneously occurred with hydrogenation. The higher
heating value (HHV), calculated based on the elemental composition
by the Dulong equation, increased with elevated temperature, and the
highest HHV (40.48 MJ kg–1) was obtained at 280
°C. It is illustrated that the catalytic HDO process accompanying
loss of oxygen can effectively improve the energy density of the bio-oil.

2.2.2 GC–Mass
Spectrometry (MS) Analysis
The chemical compositions of CBO
and UBO obtained at different
hydrotreating temperatures were identified by GC–MS (Figure S3). Table 3 shows the relative amounts of each component detected
in the bio-oil. Each sample contained mainly phenols, esters, fatty
acids, ketones, aldehydes, and other heteroatom (N, S) compounds.
The amounts of small molecular products derived from bio-oil are low,
including phenols, aldehydes, and acids, and the main components were
oligomers. Particularly, the small molecular phenolic compounds contained
methoxy, unsaturated side-chain alkyl groups. It can be seen that
the number of small molecular compounds increased dramatically after
being hydrotreated. Esters and monomeric phenolic derivatives make
up the largest part of the upgraded oil. Esterification could easily
take place with the use of a strong acid catalyst at low reaction
temperature.43 Brönsted acids and
Lewis acids coexist on the surface of NbOPO4, which could
catalyze the esterification reaction and promote the cleavage of main
linkages (β-O-4 and 4-O-5 ether bonds) in lignin oligomers to
monomeric phenolic units. There were certain amounts of monomeric
phenolic compounds when the support was used as the catalyst. It could
also be seen that there were more esters formed through esterification
with ethanol, which was an effective approach to reduce the bio-oil’s
acidity and enhance its stability.44 The
content of esters increased dramatically from 4.67 to 23.26%. Most
of esters existed in the form of aliphatic esters; however, the corresponding
acids for some aliphatic esters, such as ethyl hexadecanoate and ethyl
octadecanoate, were not detected in CBO and thus the Guerbet reaction
between ethanol and the aliphatic fragments of lignin might occur.45 Huang et al. suspected that these esters come
from two parts: one was the transesterification between alcohols and
triglycerides and the other was oxidative esterification reaction
between the aliphatic −OH groups of lignin oligomers and ethanol.46 Notably, there still existed many acids, but
majority of them were aromatic compounds that were not detected in
CBO. This further certified that the lignin oligomers degraded during
the process. Furthermore, the supported Pd metal was responsible for
the hydrogenation of unsaturated alkyl side group of monomeric phenolic
compounds in CBO.28 The monomeric phenolic
derivatives increased from 28.48 to 39.99%. 4-Vinylguaiacol can be
converted into 4-ethylguaiacol. 4-Vinylphenol as a representative
monomer in CBO could be converted into 4-ethylphenol and ethylcyclohexanone
via hydrogenation. Moreover, the category of monomeric phenolic compounds
got more than that in CBO, and the newly observed ones, such as 4-methylphenol,
could be originated from the hydrogenolysis depolymerization of lignin
oligomers. Nevertheless, the acid catalyst could also catalyze a number
of other reactions, including transesterification, etherification,
aldol condensation, oligomerization, and dehydration/decomposition
of sugars/furans.43 The O-alkylation of
phenolic compounds with proper proportion was observed, which implied
that ethyl group substitution occurred during the process and high
reaction temperature enhanced the etherification. Furthermore, the
diphenol, which might be originated from the removal of the methyl
group of methoxy phenol, was also observed. These reactions were beneficial
to retard repolymerization of depolymerized lignin derivatives.38 Although the series of reactions might account
for the reasons why HHV increased with elevated temperature, hydrotreatment
of bio-oil was the main reason for the HHV increase. It should be
noted that aldehydes were the important parts identified in CBO and
that the aldehyde compounds declined during the depolymerization process
by C=O hydrogenation. Finally, it was worth noting that cyclic
ketone and its derivatives were also detected in UBO, which might
be originated from the following three aspects: (1) the monomeric
phenol being deeply hydrogenated over the catalyst to form products
such as 4-methylcyclohexanone and 4-ethylcyclohexanone; (2) hydrogenation
of furfurals and its derivatives; and (3) degradation of the oligomers
in the process. More specially, arenes or alkanes were hardly detected
under all reaction conditions due to the existence of competed adsorption
mechanism on catalyst surface between furfurals and phenolic compounds,
which suppressed the deep hydrodeoxygenation of phenolic compounds.47 Ethanol also participated in the reaction, which
also retarded phenolic hydrodeoxygenation.

Moreover, the kinds of small molecular
ester had decreased dramatically
using NbOPO4 as catalyst, which might be caused by deploymerization
of parts of sugar derivatives. The unsaturated side chains of phenolics
were also still detected C=C in UBO when NbOPO4 was
used as catalyst. Notably, the O-alkylation of phenolic compounds
and diphenol was detected and the results illustrated that the acid
sites of support catalyzed these processes.

2.2.3 Effect
of Catalysts on the Distribution
of Molecular Weight (Mw) of Bio-oil
Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis of the nonvolatile
fractions (Figure 6) demonstrated that catalyst and temperature had significant effect
on product distribution. Compared to the molecular-weight distribution
of CBO (Mw = 320; Mn = 298), the average molecular weight of UBO was distinctly
reduced (Figure S4). It was demonstrated
that the amounts of small molecular compounds significantly increased
after hydrotreatment degrading process over Pd/NbOPO4 in
ethanol. The percentage of the species with a molecular weight range
of 300–400 Da in CBO was 41.58% and that above 400 Da accounted
for 22.16%, whereas that with low molecular weight, i.e., below 200
Da, was only 5.33%, which agreed well with the GC results. Furthermore,
it should be noted that the species with molecular weight between
300 and 400 Da and above 400 Da were dramatically reduced compared
to the CBO with evaluated temperature. Particularly, when the hydrotreating
temperature reached 280 °C, the average molecular weight (Mw = 275; Mn = 242)
had an apparent decrease. The percentage of species with molecular
weight below 200 Da was 18.87%, whereas those with molecular weight
above 400 Da was only 3.34%. It implied that that the degraded products
have low-molecular-weight distribution. Notably, the species with
molecular weight below 200 Da had not dramatically increased and most
species centered at a molecular weight range of 200–300 Da.
Two reasons could account for these results: one was that there existed
more C–C connection between dimers, which was difficult to
be cleaved, and the other was that ethanol as reaction medium reacted
with degraded products containing phenolic −OH and −OCH3 via the O-alkylation (alkylation on phenolic −OH groups),
as well as etherification of phenolic compounds, leading to increase
of the molecular weight. Furthermore, the phenolic −OH group
and Cα=Cβ unsaturated side
chain were found to be the most reactive toward repolymerization due
to the condensation between aromatic rings and the side-chain carbons.48 From the quantified monomers, we observed the
decrease of phenolic compounds with evaluated temperature. Particularly,
the support showed better prosperity: the species with molecular weight
below 200 Da was 17.80%, and those with molecular weight above 400
Da was also 16.59%. Furthermore, there existed a certain amount of
high-molecular-weight polymers not detected due to their insolubility
in solvents.

from
hydrotreating at different temperatures. *Catalyst: NbOPO4.

To reveal the depolymerized products
in detail, the molecular-weight
distribution of fragments in CBO and UBO with increase of reaction
temperature was detected by electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS. The
ESI-MS images depicted in Figure 7 compared the absolute molecular mass distribution
of the organic products obtained at different temperatures. It could
be observed that the crude bio-oil covered a broad m/z relative intensity distribution region ranging
from approximately 100 to 650. However, the UBO after hydrotreating
had a relatively narrow intensity molecular-weight distribution region
and the relative intensities were concentrated in the range of 100–350.
Most of the obtained products were mainly monomers and small dimers,
and the largest molecular fragment m/z showed high intensities of 304 and 332. It could be noted that the
results at different temperatures showed a similar distribution of m/z and that the supports also achieved
oligomer depolymerization to some extent. Generally, the molecular
fragments with m/z higher than 250
are assigned to oligomers rather than to monophenolic compounds.49 There still existed a little amount of oligomers
in UBO possibly due to partial depolymerization of large oligomers.

2.2.4 Possible
Structure of Oligomers Formed
Two-dimensional (2D) heteronuclear
single quantum coherence (HSQC)
NMR, as a useful method for detailed understanding of the lignin structure,
was applied to the analysis of the lignin oligomers of bio-oil. Comparing
the spectra of CBO and UBO (Figure 8), it can be observed that the NMR signals in aromatic
(δC/δH 90–160/4.6–8.4
ppm) and oxygenated side-chain regions (δC/δH 50–90/2.8–5.0 ppm) decreased, whereas those
in the aliphatic side-chain region (δC/δH 10–40/0.5–2.5 ppm) significantly increased.
The different lignin unit cross signals from syringyl (S′),
guaiacyl (G), hydroxyphenyl (H), ferulate (FA), and p-coumarate (PCA) can be clearly observed in the aromatic region in
CBO (Figure 9a). In
the side-chain region, methoxy cross signals were predominant and
interunit linkages, such as β-O-4′ and 4-O-5, can also
be observed, whereas other linkages, such as 5-5, β-1, and β-β′
cannot be detected probably due to their relative low abundance.46 After being hydrotreated, the signals of G and
S′ units were both decreased or even disappeared in the aromatic
region, whereas the H units increased compared to G and S′
units after hydrotreatment. The initial signals corresponding to FA,
S, G, Pβ, and PCA units completely or partly disappeared.
Notably, in the side-chain region (Figure 9b), the newly appeared peaks can be assigned
to ethyl and methyl groups of alkylated products and esters. Furthermore,
the intensity of methoxy group signals decreased, which indicated
that demethoxylation occurred, as proved by gas products. These results
also illustrated that the oligomers could be depolymerized in a greater
degree over Pd/NbOPO4 in ethanol. Combining the ESI-MS
results and deploymerized monomers, structures of a few oligomers
were proposed for the rich lignin oligomers of CBO. The lignin oligomers
can be effectively depolymerized to monomers or dimers by cleavage
of intraunit linkages. NbOPO4 exposed to strong Lewis acid
Nb5+ sites generates an oxygen-deficient phase by losing
its lattice oxygen and with a high propensity for the adsorption of
oxygen,50 which benefits the polarization
of C–O. The structures shown in Figure S2 were considered to be the major oligomers formed in bio-oil.
The possible depolymerization of the oligomers in ethanol in the presence
of catalyst is proposed schematically in Figure 10.

Figure 10 Proposed mechanism of oligomer depolymerization scheme.

4-Methylphenol can be produced by cracking the
oligomer 274 m/z (G unit), whereas
4-ethylphenol can
be produced by cracking the oligomer 436 m/z (S′ unit). Furthermore, oligomers VII (480 m/z), VIII (496 m/z), and IX (524 m/z) can
produce corresponding guaiacol by cleavage of C–O–C.
However, only a negligible amount of guaiacol existed, confirming
that transalkylation occurred with ethanol.

3 Conclusions
Bio-oil from low-temperature torrefaction of
pubescens was upgraded
using ethanol as solvent with the Pd/NbOPO4 heterogeneous
catalyst. The HHV increased from 26.96 to 40.48 MJ kg–1, and the oxygen content decreased from 29.53 to 9.78%. Compared
to CBO, the acids, aldehydes, and furans were efficiently converted
into esters and alcohol in UBO, where esters, ketones, and alkyl-substituted
phenol compounds were the main components. The cleavage of aryl ether
bond took place simultaneously with the dehydration, esterification,
etherification, acetalization, and hydrogenation in the upgrading
process, and the lignin oligomers were further depolymerized over
the Pd/NbOPO4 catalyst. The oligomers were well depolymerized
into small molecular compounds and mainly monomers. It is proved that
Pd/NbOPO4 is an excellent catalyst in promoting bio-oil
upgrading.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Pd(NO3)2·xH2O, niobium pentoxide,
and tartaric acid were purchased from J&K Chemicals. Hydrofluoric
acid was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All other reagents were purchased
from Kelong Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., China. All chemicals were used
as received without further purification.

Pubescens,51 a kind of typical high-production and fast-growing
lignocelluloses biomass, mainly consisting of hemicellulose (∼18.8
wt %), cellulose (∼45.1 wt %), and lignin (∼24.2 wt
%), was chosen as a representative of fast-growing renewable biomass
resource in the study. The sample of pubescens was purchased from
Anji county of Zhejiang province in China.

4.2 Preparation
of Bio-oil
Bio-oil (BO)
was obtained from torrefaction of pubescens at 200 °C with a
heating ramp of 2.5 °C min–1 in N2 atmosphere. Before being used in torrefaction, the pubescens was
ground to get particles with particle size smaller than 80 meshes,
washed six times with distilled water, and dried in an oven overnight
at 110 °C. The use of low heating rate could avoid overheating
on the one hand, since the final temperature of the torrefaction is
controlled to be only 200 °C. On the other hand, because the
heat-transfer capacity of the pubescens sample is poor, the low heating
rate will help to achieve uniform heating of pubescens sample. The
crude bio-oil (CBO) used for upgrading is obtained via reduced-pressure
evaporation at 40 °C of BO for 2 h, where part of water was removed.
According to our previous study,8 oligomers
(mainly lignin oligomers) were the major torrefaction liquid products.

4.3 Catalyst Preparation
Mesoporous niobium
phosphate support was synthesized according to the literature.52,53 The catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of
the support with 0.93 mol L–1 Pd(NO3)2·xH2O aqueous solution. After
impregnated for 24 h, the sample was dried at 110 °C for 12 h,
followed by calcination in air at 500 °C for 3 h with a linear
heating ramp of 2 °C min–1. The loading of
Pd on the catalyst is about 5% based on theoretical calculation according
to the starting materials used.

4.4 Bio-oil
Upgrading Test
The process
of hydrotreating was carried out using ethanol as solvent. The CBO
(0.2 g), Pd/NbOPO4 (0.2 g), or NbOPO4 (0.2 g)
catalyst and 25 mL of ethanol as solvent were added into a 50 mL of
Hastelloy alloys in a high-pressure autoclave (SenLang MC50) equipped
with a thermocouple and a mechanical stirrer. The reactor was purged
six times by H2, with each time releasing the pressure
back down to atmosphere pressure and then increasing the pressure
to 500 psi with H2. The autoclave was heated to the target
reaction temperature with a stirring rate of 500 rpm and then kept
for 8 h. After reaction, the autoclave was cooled rapidly by electric
fan to ambient temperature, the reaction mixture was filtered to remove
the solid, the solid was washed with ethanol three times, and the
filtrate and washing liquid were collected in a volumetric flask.
The upgraded bio-oil (UBO) was obtained via reduced-pressure evaporation
at 40 °C for 30 min to remove ethanol and part of water. For
all catalytic runs, solid products were collected after reaction.
Further analyses of the organic phase were carried out by GC–MS
or FID, GPC, LC-TOF-MS, and 2D HSQC NMR methods. The yields of organic
products were calculated as 1  Elemental analysis was conducted by Vario
MACRO cube (Elementar Analysensysteme, Hanau, Germany). The oxygen
content was calculated by difference based on C, H, N, and S.54 The HHV was determined using the Dulong formula54 2  where C,
H, O, N, and S refer to the mass
fractions of the elements.

4.5 Catalyst Characterizations
The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area analysis of the catalysts was carried out by N2 adsorption and desorption at 77 K using a Micromeritics TriStar
II 3020 apparatus. The total pore volume was determined from the adsorption
and desorption branches of the nitrogen isotherms at P/P0 = 0.99. X-ray powder diffraction
(XRD) patterns were obtained on a Rigaku (Japan) D/MAX-RC X-ray diffractometer
set at 40 kV and 40 mA using Cu Kα radiation. Data were collected
at steps of 1° min–1 in the 2θ range
of 10–80°. Metallic surface and dispersion were determined
by H2 chemisorption. The amounts of acid sites on the catalysts
were determined by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD), using the Auto Chem II 2920 instrument. Prior to TPD
measurements, the samples were in situ reduced at 260 °C, pretreated
in flowing He (45 mL min–1) for 1 h at 500 °C,
and then cooled to 100 °C. NH3 was adsorbed onto the
samples by flowing 5% NH3 in He gas mixture (50 mL min–1) for 4 h at 100 °C. Residual and physically
adsorbed NH3 was removed by purging the samples with flowing
45 mL min–1 at 100 °C for 1 h. Desorption of
NH3 was performed by heating the samples at a rate of 10
°C min–1 under flowing He (45 mL min–1) from 100 to 600 °C. Pyridine-FTIR spectra were used to identify
the type of acid sites (Brönsted or Lewis) using a Vertex 70/80
apparatus equipped with a Spectra catalytic chamber. The chemical
state and surface elemental composition were measured by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) in an AXIS Ultra DLD (KRATOS) spectrometer at 80
eV pass energy using monochromatic Al Kα radiation. The C 1s
peak at 284.6 eV was used as reference to locate the other peaks.

4.6 Product Analysis
The small molecular
liquid products were analyzed by GC–MS (Agilent 6820, Agilent
Technologies) using an HP-INNOWAX capillary column. The oven temperature
was maintained at 50 °C for 5 min and then increased to 250 °C
at a ramp of 5 °C min–1 and maintained at 250
°C for 10 min. The identified small molecular products were further
qualitatively quantified by peak area normalization method to calculate
their relative contents. The identified small molecular liquid products
were quantitatively determined by an internal standard method using
GC-FID (Fuli 9750) equipped with a DB-5 capillary column, and the
GC temperature program involved a hold at 50 °C for 5 min, rise
to 250 °C at a rate of 5 °C min–1, and
then holding at 250 °C for 10 min. The temperatures of both the
injector and detector were maintained at 280 °C. Benzyl alcohol
was used as an internal standard to quantify the content of the products.
Meanwhile, gas products were analyzed by GC-TCD (PANNAA91) with C-2000
packed column. The temperatures of the GC oven and detector were maintained
at 120 and 180 °C, respectively.

Molecular weights of the
crude bio-oil (CBO) and upgraded bio-oil (UBO) were measured by gel
permeation chromatography (GPC) using Waters 1525-2487 system equipped
with a manually packed column. The injection volume was 30 μL,
the analysis time was 10 min, and rotary-evaporated sample was dissolved
in tetrahydrofuran with a concentration of 2.5 mg mL–1. Polystyrene was used as the reference.
