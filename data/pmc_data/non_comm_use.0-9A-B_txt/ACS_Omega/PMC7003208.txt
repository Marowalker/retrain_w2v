This study aims to investigate the photothermal
oxidation removal of Hg0 in simulated flue gases using
photothermal catalysts at relatively low temperatures of 120–160
°C in two phases: the first phase applied the sol–gel
method to prepare TiO2 and CeO2/TiO2 photothermal catalysts and characterized surface properties by specific
surface area analysis, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The second phase investigated
the effects of operating parameters on Hg0 oxidation efficiency
at lower temperatures of 100–160 °C. The operating parameters
included reaction temperatures and modified concentrations of CeO2. Experimental results indicated that TiO2 prepared
by the sol–gel method was mainly in the anatase phase. XPS
analysis showed that Ce mostly existed in the form of Ce4+. The content of surface-chemisorbed oxygen increased with the modification
amount of CeO2. Photothermal catalytic oxidation results
indicated that CeO2/TiO2 had a much higher oxidation
efficiency of Hg0 at 120–160 °C than neat TiO2, which increased from 30–60 to >90%. 7%CeO2/TiO2 not only had the best photothermal performance
but also maintained high efficiency at a relatively higher reaction
temperature of 160 °C.

==== Body
1 Introduction
With long-lasting toxicity, bioaccumulation,
and high volatility, mercury and its derivates have been known as
one of the most severe pollutants in the atmosphere.1 After officially signing the International Minamata Convention
on October 9, 2013, the international consensus on mercury emission
reduction has been finally reached. Mercury emissions from coal-fired
power plants have been officially announced as the main target. New
coal-fired power plants are required to adopt the best available technology
(BAT) and best environmental practice (BEP) within 5 years from the
entry of the start of the convention. Existing facilities must use
the BAT and BEP within 10 years to reduce mercury pollution emissions.2 Mercury and its derivatives and NOx are major air pollutants emitted from coal-fired
power plants, which could cause severe adverse effects on the ecological
system and human health. There are three forms of mercury including
gaseous elemental mercury (Hg0) (emission concentrations
in the range of 10–100 μg/m3),3 gaseous oxidized mercury (Hg2+), and particulate
mercury (PHg). Gaseous Hg0 is insoluble in water, so it
is difficult to remove Hg0 from the flue gas desulfurization
(FGD) system. PHg can be easily removed by electrostatic precipitators
(ESPs) because of its adhesion on the surface of the particles. Therefore,
the removal of Hg0 is an obstacle to control mercury emitted
from coal-fired power plants.4

At
present, coal-fired power plants are installed mostly with a NOx removal device. The removal efficiency of
NOx is commonly higher than 90% using
selective catalytic reduction (SCR). SCR allows NO emissions from
stationary sources to comply with its standard.5 A previous study reported that SCR is an effective technique
for low operating costs to catalytically oxidize Hg0.6 However, SCR is commonly installed in the front
of the ESP because of its optimum temperature window of 300–450
°C for thermal catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides (mainly
NO). Additionally, the masking effect of high-concentration particles
in the flue gas could reduce the removal efficiency of Hg0 by SCR.7 Accordingly, this study aims
to develop a new photothermal catalyst for SCR that can simultaneously
remove Hg0 and NO at relatively low temperatures of 120–160
°C.

Photothermal catalytic oxidation of Hg0 by
TiO2 is a promising new air pollution control technology.8 However, reaction temperatures have a substantial
influence on the photothermal activity of TiO2. At lower
temperatures of 25–100 °C, the oxidation efficiency of
Hg0 using TiO2 has excellent effects. However,
its photo-oxidation efficiency is limited at reaction temperatures
above 100 °C. Thus, this study modifies TiO2 catalysts
with the transition metal Ce in order to improve the photothermal
oxidation efficiency of Hg0 at relatively low temperatures
of 120–160 °C.

This study was conducted in two phases.
The first phase was to prepare CeO2-modified TiO2 (CeO2/TiO2) and characterize the surface properties
of CeO2/TiO2 by specific surface area (SSA)
analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). The second phase was to apply photothermal catalysts to oxidize
Hg0 in a photothermal reactor. Under different operating
parameters, such as reaction temperatures and influent Hg0 concentrations, the oxidation efficiency of Hg0 was further
explored to investigate the effect of the modification amount of CeO2.

2 Methodologies
2.1 Experimental Materials and
Catalyst Preparation
The chemical reagents used to prepare
TiO2 and Ce/TiO2 and Hg0 measurement
are summarized in Table S1 with the purity
and manufacturer. The photothermal catalysts used to oxidize Hg0 were prepared by the sol–gel method. They were prepared
with titanium isopropoxide, isopropanol, and acetic acid as precursors.
Titanium isopropoxide (20 mL) was dissolved into a mixture of isopropyl
alcohol (40 mL) and acetic acid (40 mL) and stirred vigorously at
room temperature. After reacting for 10 h, 60 mL of deionized (DI)
water was added to the solution. The sol was then aged at 65 °C
to form a gel. The obtained wet gel was further dried at 105 °C
for 10 h and finally calcined at 500 °C for 3 h to obtain the
photothermal catalysts. After cooling to room temperature, TiO2 was ground into a powder, mixed with DI water to a specific
ratio (1.5 g TiO2/20 mL H2O), immersed in the
glass beads, and then dried at 105 °C. In the same manner, TiO2 coated on glass beads can be prepared by repeatedly coating
on the surface of glass beads.9 The preparation
of CeO2-modified TiO2 followed the same procedure
as the preparation of TiO2, except that Ce(NO3)3·6H2O solution with different concentrations
was dropped to the mixture of titanium isopropoxide, isopropyl alcohol,
and acetic acid in the preparation of 1–40%CeO2-modified
TiO2.

2.2 Analytical Instruments and Experimental Apparatus
In this
study, the instruments used for the surface characteristic analysis
of photothermal catalysts are summarized in Table S2. The crystalline characteristic of the photothermal catalyst
was measured using an XRD analyzer (Siemens, D5000). The CuKα
radiation was used as an X-ray source, and the scanning step was set
as 0.5 °/s. The acceleration voltage and the electrical current
were set as 40 kV and 40 mA to calculate the mass ratio (fA) of anatase in TiO2 using the following formula
(eq 1)10 1  where IR is the peak intensity of rutile (27.46°) and IA is the peak intensity of anatase (25.36°).
The grain size of anatase and rutile phases can be estimated with
the Scherrer equation (eq 2) 2  where λ is the X-ray
incident wavelength of 0.154 nm and B is the full
width at half-maxima. θ is the diffraction angle of rutile and
anatase, which are 27.46 and 25.36°, respectively. The chemical
state of Ti, Ce, and O in photothermal catalysts was measured at room
temperature using XPS (VG Scientific, ESCALAB 250). The excitation
source of X-rays was calibrated to its measurement range with C1s = 284.8 eV before measuring. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) SSA of each sample was measured using a SSA analyzer under 77
K liquid nitrogen. The samples must be subjected to degas (heated
outgassing) before analyzing. Photoluminescence (PL) was performed
using laser light with a wavelength of 325 nm and with a scanning
wavelength range of 300–900 nm.

A photothermal catalytical
reaction system was designed for this study, which consisted of a
mercury generator, a mixing chamber, a catalytic reactor, and a mercury
on-line measuring instrument (NIC, EMP-2) (Figure 1). The Hg0 vapor was generated
via a dynamic calibrator with high purity N2 as a dilution
gas; the gas flow rate was set to 900 mL/min. The gas stream was first
mixed in a mixing chamber prior to entering the catalytic reactor.
The reaction was performed in a circular double-casing reactor with
a length of 450 mm and an inside diameter of 28 mm. A near-UV lamp
was placed in the inner tube of the reactor with an illumination wavelength
of 365 nm and an illumination intensity of 15 W. Photothermal catalysts
coated on the surface of glass beads were placed between the inner
wall of the reactor and the outer wall of the outer tube. The reaction
time of the inflowing gas and the photothermal catalyst was 0.80 s.
The outer wall of the reactor was wrapped with a heating tape to control
the reaction temperatures (120, 140, and 160 °C). In this study,
the photothermal catalyst was coated on the smooth glass beads and
placed in the catalytic reactor. The reaction parameters investigated
in this study included reaction temperatures and weight percentages
of CeO2 over TiO2. After passing through the
photothermal catalysts in the reactor, the difference between the
inlet and outlet Hg0 concentrations could be used to determine
the removal efficiency of Hg0 (ηremoval) as shown in (eq 3).11,12 3  

Figure 1 Setup of the photothermal
catalytic reaction system.

In the experiments, the oxidation efficiency of Hg0 was
studied using TiO2 and 1–20%CeO2/TiO2 in a lower temperature environment. Different photothermal
catalysts were applied to conduct the photocatalytic oxidation efficiency
of Hg0 by TiO2 and 1–20%CeO2/TiO2 at lower temperatures (120–160 °C) in
a N2 atmosphere.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Surface Property Analysis
Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns of the photothermal
catalysts and that the peaks of TiO2 were located at 2θ
= 25.3° (101), 37.8° (004), 48.0° (200), 53.9°
(105), 55.1° (211), 62.7° (204), 70.3° (220), 75.1°
(215), and 82.8° (224). According to the code of 001093 in AMCSD
(American Mineralogist Crystal Structure Database),13 it was found that these peaks corresponded to the anatase
phase, while the rutile’s peaks did not appear. Thus, the TiO2 prepared by the sol–gel method was mainly in the anatase
phase. Table S3 summarizes that the grain
size of TiO2 and 1–40%CeO2/TiO2 calculated with the Scherrer equation ranged from 4 to 12 nm. In
addition, from the XRD spectrum of each photothermal catalyst, it
could be known that 1–20%CeO2/TiO2 peaked
at 2θ = 28.5° (111), 33.1° (200), 47.5° (220),
57.1° (311), 70.41° (400), 77.8° (331), 79.1°
(420), and 88.5° (422), respectively, and did not exhibit the
peaks of CeO2.14 It might be
attributed that CeO2 was added in such a small amount and
did not form an independent crystal.15 When
the modification amount of CeO2 reached up to 40%, the
peak intensity at 2θ = 25.4, 37.8, and 48.1° attenuated
substantially. Likewise, the intensity of peaks in 40%CeO2/TiO2 representing the fluorite CeO2 crystallite
was far weaker than those of CeO2, which was probably attributed
to the relatively lower contents of CeO2 or TiO2 on the surface of CeO2/TiO2s than those of
neat and CeO2 or TiO2.

Figure 2 XRD spectra of TiO2, 1–40%CeO2/TiO2, and CeO2.

To investigate
the form of CeO2 distributed on TiO2s, the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) morphologies of neat TiO2 and
7%CeO2/TiO2 are displayed in Figure 3. The lattice space of TiO2 nanoparticles was measured to be about 0.35 nm (see Figure 3a), which was assigned
to the fringe space of the (101) plane in anatase. After the modification,
the lattice space of 7%CeO2/TiO2 granules was
0.35 nm as well, while the typical lattice spaces of 0.31 nm and 0.38
nm corresponding to the planes of (111) and (101) of cubic fluorite
CeO2 were not found.16 In addition,
the XRD result had demonstrated that independent CeO2 crystals
were not formed on the surface of 1–20%CeO2/TiO2. Previous literature reported that both the ion radius of
Ce3+ (0.103 nm) and Ce4+ (0.102 nm) are larger
than the radius of Ti4+ 0.064 nm and it is difficult for
Ce3+ and Ce4+ to substitute the Ti4+ or insert into the crystal cell of TiO2.17 Thus, the added CeO2 was probably amorphously
distributed on the surface of TiO2.

TiO2 and (c,d) 7%CeO2/TiO2.

The SSA is one
of the important physical parameters that affect the adsorption activity
of the photothermal catalysts. The SSAs of various photothermal catalysts
are summarized in Table 1 The BET SSA of TiO2 was 72.1 m2/g, and those
of 1–40%CeO2/TiO2 were 88.8, 104.9, 117.5,
119.3, 122.8, 123.1, 124.9, 129.1 m2/g, respectively. The
commercial CeO2 has a SSA of only 5.6 m2/g.
It can be seen that the SSA of CeO2/TiO2 prepared
by the sol–gel method was significantly improved and increased
with the addition of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O during the preparation. The distribution pattern of the BET SSAs
varied significantly between TiO2 and 7%CeO2/TiO2, as shown in Figure S1. The surface areas of meso- and micropores in 7%CeO2/TiO2 were much higher than those in TiO2, revealing
that a large number of meso- and micropores were generated because
of the modification of CeO2, thereby leading to the increase
in BET SSAs of CeO2/TiO2s.

The chemical
composition of the photothermal catalysts was measured by XPS. The
survey spectra of pristine TiO2 and 7%CeO2/TiO2 are first investigated. The main XPS peaks of the two photothermal
catalysts were attributed to Ti and O. The difference between their
profiles was little significant. The intensity of the binding energy
peak representing Ce 3d was much weaker than that of Ti and O peaks
in 7%CeO2/TiO2, as shown in Figure 4. Figure 5 shows the XPS spectra of Ti 2p. It was observed
that two well-defined characteristic peaks attributing to Ti 2p1/2
at about 464 eV and Ti 2p3/2 at about 458 eV appeared for all CeO2/TiO2 samples, indicating that Ti was mainly in
the form of Ti4+.18−22 As
the modification amount of CeO2 increased, the binding
energies of surface Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 in
these photothermal catalysts overall moved toward a higher energy
direction. For instance, the binding energies of Ti 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 increased to 465.1 and 460.2 eV, respectively,
when the amount of CeO2 reached up to 20%, which suggested
an alteration of the chemical state of the Ti atom on the surface.
It was probably because accompanying the surface modification of CeO2, the terminal oxygen atom of Ti on the surface of TiO2 would be connected with a Ce atom to form Ti–O–Ce
or more oxygen vacancies will be generated on the surface, thereby
causing the trapping of outer layer electrons of the Ti atom by the
nearby Ce atom or oxygen vacancy.23

Figure 5 Ti 2p XPS spectrum of each catalyst.

Figure 6 shows the
Ce 3d XPS spectra of 1–20%CeO2/TiO2.
Previous literature indicated that the major difference of the Ce
3d XPS features between CeO2 and Ce2O3 is that the Ce 3d XPS peak of CeO2 consists of three
pairs of spin–orbit doublets, while that of Ce2O3 has only two pairs of spin–orbit doublets.24 The Ce 3d XPS feature of 1%CeO2/TiO2 exhibits four deconvolution subpeaks, which are assigned
to two pairs of spin–orbital doublets; however, as the modification
amount increased, more than two pairs of spin–orbital doublets
gradually emerged in the Ce3d XPS spectra of 3–20%CeO2/TiO2, implying that their Ce(IV) oxide mostly existed
in a relatively high weight ratio of CeO2 over TiO2. Additionally, the bind peaks labeled u1 and v1 in Ce 3d XPS spectra of 1–20%CeO2/TiO2 represent the initial electronic states of Ce 3d104f1, and
the corresponding Ce valence was Ce3+; while the peaks
labeled u, v, u2, v2, u3, and v3 were the electronic state of Ce 3d104f0, and the corresponding
Ce valence is Ce4+.25 The transformation
between CeO2 and Ce2O3 is believed
to be an important factor for oxidizing Hg0 because active
oxygen as the primary oxidant of Hg0 was generated during
the transformation of Ce valence.26 The
semiquantitative analysis of XPS could determine the mass ratio of
different electronic states of Ti 2p, Ce 3d, and different forms of
O 1s (Table 2).

For O 1s (Figure 7), two kinds of oxygen species were observed in TiO2.
The peak at around 529.1 eV corresponded to lattice oxygen (denoted
as Oα), while the one at about 531.0 eV was regarded
as surface-chemisorbed oxygen (denoted as Oβ).20 The O 1s also shifted to a high binding energy
with the addition of CeO2. Because surface-chemisorbed
oxygen (Oβ) was considered to have one of the main
roles in oxidizing Hg0,21 the
proportion of Oβ gradually increased with the modification
amount of CeO2, implying that the addition of CeO2 could contribute to the oxidation of Hg0.

Figure 8 depicts the fluorescence
spectrum of TiO2 and 1–20%CeO2/TiO2. It showed that TiO2 had a fluorescence peak at
550 nm. This peak was thought to be caused by the migration of Ti3+ electrons to O–.27 The PL peak of CeO2/TiO2 decreased obviously
compared to that of TiO2, meaning that the recombination
rate of photogenerated electrons and holes in TiO2 was
significantly reduced by the addition of CeO2. The addition
of CeO2 is beneficial to prolonging the separation time
of TiO2 photogenerated electron–hole pairs. It was
speculated that the electrons of TiO2 migrate from its
conductive band to the conductive band of Ce and the holes of Ce migrate
to the valence band of TiO2, thereby increasing the accumulation
of electrons in the Ce band and the TiO2 valence band.
Effective separation of CeO2/TiO2 electrons
and holes promoted the activity of photothermal catalysts.

3.2 Photothermal Catalytic Oxidation
Efficiency of Hg0
The experiments investigated
the effect of reaction temperatures on the oxidation efficiency of
Hg0 with these photothermal catalysts. The experimental
parameters were summarized as follows: influent Hg0 concentration
of 75 μg/m3; reaction temperatures of 120, 140, and
160 °C; reaction time of 120 min, and near-UV light (λ
= 365 nm) was used as a light source. Figure 9 illustrates that the photothermal-oxidation
efficiencies of Hg0 by different catalysts were ordered
from high to low as: η120°C > η140°C > η160°C. Each catalyst
had a photothermal efficiency of more than 90% at 120 °C. As
the reaction temperature increased, the photothermal efficiency decreased
significantly. In particular, the oxidation efficiency of TiO2 was only about 20% at 160 °C. Nevertheless, the oxidation
efficiency of Hg0 using 1–20%CeO2/TiO2 was much higher than that of TiO2. The first stage
of CeO2/TiO2 for the removal of Hg0 was physical adsorption. As the reaction progressed, once the adsorption
reached equilibrium, Hg0 was converted to its catalytic
oxidation state of Hg2+.28 Under
photothermal catalytic conditions, the lattice oxygen (Oα) of the catalyst then participated in the oxidation of Hg0. The lattice oxygen (Oα) was mainly derived from
the change of the Ce valence state, and the reaction formula was as
follows (eq 4) 4  

Figure 9 Comparison of photothermal catalytic oxidation
efficiency of Hg0 with TiO2 and 1–20%CeO2/TiO2 at a flow concentration of 75 μg/m3 at (a) 120, (b) 140, and (c) 160 °C.

Because metal oxide
transfer could provide lattice oxygen (Oα), Hg0 could be oxidized by lattice oxygen (Oα)
in the absence of O2 as follows (eq 5).29 5  

It was pointed
out that Ce could adsorb oxygen to produce highly reactive oxygen
species and form oxidized species of lattice oxygen (Oα). However, in general flue gas, O2 will provide an oxygen
atom to the metal oxide, ensuring that the oxidation of Hg0 could continue. The transfer of O2 to the lattice oxygen
(Oα) in the metal oxide is as follows (eq 6) 6  

Chemically adsorbed
oxygen (Oβ) is also known as hydroxyl oxygen (OH),
and eq 7 and eq 8 described the oxidation
of Hg0 by the hydroxyl oxygen and the regeneration of hydroxyl
oxygen on the catalyst surface, respectively. 7   8  

The effect of different modified concentrations of CeO2/TiO2 on the photocatalytic oxidation of Hg0 at 120–160 °C is shown in Figure 10. The addition of CeO2 increased
the efficiency of photothermal catalytic oxidation of Hg0 at 120 °C. The photothermal oxidation efficiency of Hg0 by 1–20%CeO2/TiO2 was slightly
improved with the concentration of CeO2. The original 80%
efficiency for neat TiO2 increased to over 90% for 7%CeO2/TiO2. As the reaction temperature increases, the
effect of the increase in the modification concentration on the removal
efficiency was more obvious. When the reaction temperature reached
140 °C, the photothermal oxidation efficiency of Hg0 by 1, 3, and 20%CeO2/TiO2 decreased significantly,
but they were still higher than that of TiO2, while 5,
7, and 10%CeO2/TiO2 retained above 70% of Hg0 removal efficiency. When the reaction temperature increased
to 160 °C, the photothermal oxidation efficiency of Hg0 by neat TiO2 was only about 20%, but those for 1–20%CeO2/TiO2 increased by about 10–40%. The photothermal
efficiency of 7%CeO2/TiO2 even exceeded 90%
at 160 °C. It could be seen that the photothermal removal efficiency
of Hg0 gradually improved as the modification amount of
CeO2 increased from 1 to 7%, probably because more surface-chemisorbed
oxygen was generated on the surface region. The 7%CeO2/TiO2 not only has the best photothermal performance but also maintains
high efficiency at a relatively higher reaction temperature of 160
°C. Nevertheless, a further increase in the CeO2 content
to 20%CeO2 weakened the photothermal activity of CeO2/TiO2 instead, the reason for which further investigation
is needed.

catalytic oxidation efficiency of Hg0 by various catalysts
at different temperatures.

4 Conclusions
This study investigated the difference in the SSA between neat
TiO2 and CeO2/TiO2s. The SSA of CeO2/TiO2s after upgrading was higher than that before
the modification and increased with the increase of the added amount.
It is known from the XRD pattern that TiO2 was mainly composed
of the anatase crystal form, and there was no peak of rutile. It could
be seen from the PL spectrum that the peak of CeO2/TiO2 was significantly lower than the peak intensity of TiO2. It showed that the rate of recombination of photoexcited
electrons and holes was reduced. The addition of CeO2 could
prolong the recombination time of TiO2-photogenerated electrons
and holes and had a significant effect on the improvement of photothermal
catalytic activity. The photothermal oxidation efficiency of Hg0 in this study showed that the removal efficiency of Hg0 between TiO2 and 1–20%CeO2/TiO2 decreased with the increase of reaction temperature. Ce-modified
TiO2 could effectively improve the oxidation efficiency
of elemental mercury. The Ce could adsorb oxygen to generate active
oxygen to form a lattice oxygen (Oα)-oxidizing substance.
If O2 was present in the general flue gas, O2 would provide oxygen like a metal oxide to ensure that Hg0 oxidation can continue.
