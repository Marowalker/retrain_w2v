We
have developed a bright optical setup, especially optimized
for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) correlation spectroscopy.
We show that the brightness of the experiment combined with the correlation
approach permits in situ access to the size and shape of the SERS-active
aggregates in solution despite a very weak SERS signal of the adsorbed
molecules. As a result, we demonstrate that dimers and larger SERS-active
aggregates can be identified through the temporal fluctuations of
the SERS signal of only a few hundred of adsorbed molecules, that
is, at zeptomole adsorbate concentrations. Monomers covered by a monolayer
of MBA were also identified. These results open a way for single nanoparticle
sensing, for single-molecule SERS-active aggregate characterization,
or for quantitative monitoring of functionalization processes on metallic
objects.

Introduction
Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)
is a phenomenon by which
molecules at nanometer distances from a metallic surface may present
Raman scattering cross-sections enhanced by several orders of magnitude.
It is therefore a widely used technique for ultrasensitive chemical
sensing, in particular, as the ultimate stage of single-molecule detection1−3 was achieved. It is well-established that the Raman enhancement
factors (EFs) are mainly due to the plasmon resonances of the metal
that induce high electric field localization within nanogap regions
of the substrate. Therefore SERS EFs strongly depend on the morphology
of the metallic substrate. Hence, a key point in the control and understanding
of SERS experiments is the determination of the relationship between
the optical and structural properties of the metallic surfaces hosting
the molecules.

Among the various SERS substrates, Ag and Au
spherical colloids
have attracted massive attention4 as they
can easily be prepared via robust and low-cost wet chemistry procedures
and present very strong EFs in the visible range when the nanoparticles
(NPs) flocculate and form aggregates. However, these nanosize objects
are difficult to image optically as they are far below the diffraction
limit. Establishing a direct correlation between their sizes and shapes
on the one hand and their SERS EFs on the other hand is therefore
a challenging task. This can however be done by imaging isolated NPs,
dried from a colloidal solution or directly grown on a substrate,
with an atomic force microscope5 or a transmission
electron microscope6 combined with a Raman
spectrometer or by super-resolution optical imaging.7 However most of the studies image a sample of the colloidal
solutions by electron microscopy but realize the optical measurements
on another sample of the solutions. The relationship between the two
experiments is then assumed and this may lead to some possible misinterpretations.8

In a previous paper,9 we have shown
that SERS correlation spectroscopy (SERS-CS) is a very well-adapted
technique to overcome the issue of characterizing specifically SERS-active
aggregates in colloidal solutions while measuring their SERS activity.
This method, initially proposed by Eggeling et al.,10 relies on the measurement of the SERS signal of the molecules
adsorbed on metallic NPs as they diffuse through a confocal microscope.11 This creates temporal fluctuations of the measured
SERS signal, and their statistical analysis leads to the determination
of hydrodynamic translational and rotational diffusion times of the
NPs, which are both related to their sizes. However, in this original
paper as well as in more recent ones,12,13 SERS-CS was
not exploited for its particle-sizing potential, and only the rotational
time was analyzed to perform statistical characterizations of the
SERS activity of NP aggregates. In parallel, the analysis of the translational
coefficient of the particle via SERS-CS was proposed to study the
surface interactions14 or via SERS measurements
combined with NP tracking to determine the size distribution of the
SERS-active clusters in solution.15 We
were the first group9 to show that the
combined analysis of the translational and rotational diffusion coefficients,
using the appropriated hydrodynamic model, permits an unambiguous
determination of the size and aggregation state of specifically SERS-active
clusters. In the present paper, we extend our approach to very weak
SERS signals, thereby giving a high sensibility to the method, which
can be exploited to characterize better metallic colloidal solutions,
SERS EFs, and functionalization processes that are massively used
in NP technology.16 Experiments were performed
on silver colloidal solutions to which a very low concentration of
4-mercaptobenzoic acid (MBA) was added to prevent massive aggregation
of the NPs and to test the sensitivity of the experiment under such
weak SERS EF conditions. Two different concentrations were studied:
the first one chosen in such a way that a single self-assembled monolayer
(SAM) of MBA is adsorbed on the Ag spherical monomers and a second
one, 50 times lower, corresponding to only a few hundreds of molecules
per NP. The experimental data show that the diffusion of SAM MBA-covered
Ag monomers can be identified. We emphasize that other techniques
cannot reach such a sensitivity.5,8 At lower MBA concentrations,
the signal of the monomers was not detectable anymore, whereas those
of the dimers and larger aggregates were still accessed. In particular,
the identification of aggregates formed by less than 30 NPs that present
SERS enhancements 2 orders of magnitude larger than the monomers,
that is, not linearly dependent on the number of NPs in the cluster,
is an indication that hot spot regions containing only a few molecular
probes were measured. Such sensitivity was previously obtained, as
metallic aggregates were proved to produce SERS EFs, which are sufficient
for single-molecule sensing.1,2,17 However, such sensing was obtained without any information on the
nature of the aggregate supporting such EFs. By contrast, we show
here that molecular identification at zeptomole sensitivity can be
obtained together with the size and shape recognition of the NPs hosting
the molecules.

Results and Discussion
Ag NP Solution Characterization
The Ag colloidal stock
solution was first characterized by standard means of scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a commercial
apparatus, extinction spectra, and Raman measurements. SEM images
were difficult to record because of the formation of NaOH crystals
as the drop of the colloid dries. Nevertheless, spherical NPs with
a physical radius r = 8.25 ± 2 nm (diameter d = 16.5 ± 4 nm) are observed (Figure 1a). This result is supported by the DLS measurements
made on the commercial apparatus that calculates the size distribution
of the NPs as a function of their number (Figure 1b). From the latter, one can see that the
colloidal solution is mainly composed of NPs of hydrodynamic radius rH = 8.5 ± 2.5 nm. The difference between
the physical and hydrodynamic radius is due to the charge layers surrounding
the NPs in solution. Moreover, the commercial apparatus also provides
the size distribution plotted as a function of the scattered intensities
(Figure 1c). In this
case, the estimated hydrodynamic radius is larger and is worth rH = 11.6 ± 3.5 nm. This is because the
scattered intensities are proportional to the volume of the NPs, which
favor the largest NPs. Besides, the extinction spectrum presented
in Figure 2a shows
the expected band at 400 nm, characteristic of the electrostatic plasmon
resonances of the individual Ag NPs a few tens of nanometers in diameter.
This band is quite narrow, and the spectrum does not present any additional
resonances, thereby indicating a stable colloidal solution of rather
monodisperse NPs. Finally, the Raman spectrum of the solution, plotted
in Figure 2b in the
region where the MBA bands will be expected, only presents a weak
water Raman band (bending mode) at 1650 cm–1.18

crystals

region of interest, and (c,d) DLS ACF. Measured ACFs (blue diamonds)
are fitted (black line) by eq 2 using the characteristic times of coherence τC and of translational diffusion τD indicated in
the figures. They correspond to NPs of hydrodynamic radius rH = 9.2 nm (c) and rH = 13.7 nm (d) depending on the nature
of the NPs in the confocal volume.

A preliminary step to SERS-CS measurements was to measure
the DLS
auto-correlation functions (ACFs) of the characterized colloidal stock
solution with our optical setup. Each final ACF of the Rayleigh intensities
is a sum of 2–5 ACFs, each one being derived from intensities
acquired during 10 s. The final ACF is fitted using eq 2 to determine the different diffusion
times from which the hydrodynamic radius of the NPs is obtained. ⟨N⟩, AR, and β are
also adjusted, whereas the values of the modulus of the scattering
vector q and that of w = 40 are
fixed and given by the experimental setup.19 Importantly, using our experimental setup, DLS, and latter SERS-CS,
measurements are always analyzed from the measured intensities. The
values obtained for the hydrodynamic radii must therefore be compared
to those obtained from the intensity size distribution of the commercial
DLS apparatus. Figure 2c shows a DLS ACF fitted with τC = 40 μs and
τD = 2.5 ms and without considering a rotational
characteristic time τR that should appear in the
μs range. The absence of τR directly signs
the spherical shape of the NPs, whereas τC = 1/q2DD permits to access
the diffusion coefficient DD of the NPs.
The hydrodynamic radius rH of the NPs
is then calculated using the Stokes–Einstein relation described
for spherical moving species: rH = kBT/6πηDD, where kB is the Boltzmann
constant and η and T are the viscosity and
temperature of the solution, respectively. As the experiments were
conducted at a room temperature T = 23 °C where kBT/η = 4.38 × 10–18 m3 s–1, τc = 40 μs corresponds to a hydrodynamic radius rH = 9.2 nm. Finally, the translational diffusion
time (τD = r02/4DD) gives access to the value of r0 that
will be necessary for the SERS-CS measurement interpretation. Because
of a slight size dispersion and a small confocal volume containing
only a few NPs, statistical changes of these parameters occur from
one measurement to another. Figure 2d shows a DLS ACF for which τC = 60
μs and τD = 3.5 ms, which corresponds to rH = 13.7 nm. This leads to an average value
of rH = 11.5 ± 2 nm, which is in
full agreement with the intensity size distribution obtained from
the commercial apparatus. The two ACFs of Figure 2c,d were also fitted with 1/⟨N⟩ = 0.9 and 1/⟨N⟩
= 0.126, respectively, which leads to an average concentration C = ⟨N⟩/VC ≈ 0.9 ± 0.7 × 1012 NP/mL.
This value is consistent with the upper limit concentration value C′ ≈ 3.6 × 1012 NP/mL estimated
from the synthesis parameters and the ratio of the total initial Ag
mass to that of a spherical NP of physical radius r = 8.25 nm.

SERS-CS on MBA-Covered NPs
Ag Monomers
SAM MBA-Covered Identification
To conduct
the SERS-CS experiments, p-MBA molecules were used as SERS probes.
When MBA is added to the colloidal solutions, the molecules spontaneously
adsorb on the silver NPs through Ag–S and COO– bonds,20,21 which leads to a more or less rapid instability
of the colloids, depending on the MBA concentration and the pH of
the solution.22 To limit the flocculation
of the NPs but still maintain a sufficiently large number of molecules,
a 20 μM ethanol solution MBA was first added to the Ag colloidal
solution. This concentration is slightly larger than the 15 μM
value calculated to form a SAM of MBA molecules on the NPs at the
estimated size and concentration, considering a MBA packing density
of 5 molecules nm–2.22 The formation of a uniform MBA SAM on the NPs was thus presumed.
Extinction spectra were recorded during the first hours after MBA
addition. Right upon addition, the band at 400 nm undergoes a slight
red shift of 2 nm and a widening on its long wavelength side. After
a minute, the main peak starts to diminish in intensity, whereas its
widening increases until it forms a second weak peak around 530 nm
after 60 min (see Figure 3a). These observations sign the slow formation of a few NP
aggregates after addition of MBA, the single monomers being still
predominantly present in number after an hour.

ACFs measured after 25 (c) and 1 min (d) of MBA incubation. Measured
ACFs (blue diamonds) are fitted (black line) using eq 1 with the characteristic times indicated
in the figures.

Figure 3b presents
the SERS spectra measured 2 and 30 min after addition of MBA. After
30 min, the MBA SERS band at 1590 cm–1 is clearly
visible, reaching ∼20 000 counts/s. SERS-CS conducted
on this MBA SERS band was realized by acquiring 5–10 ACFs,
each one being derived from intensities acquired during 10 s, which
is a small time span as compared to the kinetics of the sample. The
ACF obtained, displayed in Figure 3c, can be fitted by considering two characteristic
times τD = 3.5 ms and τR = 4 μs
and in the absence of the coherent characteristic time τC. This fact is expected as the Raman scattering from the different
molecules is not a coherent process. As for the rotational time, its
presence indicates the diffusion of an anisotropic object that can
be identified by the analysis of τD and τR. The latter object being formed by the coagulation of spherical
NPs, we analyze (see ref (9) for details) the characteristic times using the so-called
hydrodynamic bead model that considers the aggregates as being (flexible
or rodlike) linear chains of spherical monomers.23−25 Following these
hydrodynamical theories, the translational and rotational diffusion
coefficients of a chain composed of n NPs can be
written as DDn = α(n)DD and DRn = β(n)DR, respectively, where DD (respective DR = kBT/8πηrH3) is the translational (respective
rotational) diffusion coefficient of the monomers forming the chain,
accordingly to the Stokes–Einstein theory. For dimers, α(2)
= 0.72,24,25 so that the measured characteristic time
τD = 3.5 ms corresponds to a dimer formed by two
monomers of radius rH = 9.75 nm, and β(2)
= 0.266,25 so that the measured characteristic
time τR = 4 μs corresponds to a dimer formed
by two monomers of radius rH = 10 nm.
On the one hand, these two radius values are consistent with each
other. On the other hand, they are also consistent with the estimation
of the monomer NP size in the stock solution. It is only the combination
of both of these consistencies that permits to identify the measured
SERS ACF as resulting from a dimer of 10 nm-radius monomers.9

At the shorter time after MBA addition,
the MBA SERS band at 1590
cm–1 is quite weak (∼1250 counts/s) and partially
convoluted with the Raman band of water. SERS-CS experiments were
nevertheless conducted on this MBA SERS band. The ACF obtained, displayed
in Figure 3c, presents
a unique characteristic time τD = 2.6 ms. The disappearance
of the rotational characteristic time signs the isotropic scattering
of the MBA molecules and therefore the isotropy of the hosting NPs.
Moreover, the measured τD corresponds to a hydrodynamic
radius of 9.6 nm, which is the value expected for the nonaggregated
NPs in solution. Finally, if this characteristic time was to correspond
to dimers whose rotational time was not detected, it would correspond
to dimers formed by NPs with a hydrodynamic radius rH = 6.6 nm, according to the bead model, which is an unrealistic
value. We can therefore conclude that this ACF results from the diffusion
of monomers covered by MBA molecules as first observed in ref (9). Beyond this ACF analysis,
the examination of the averaged SERS intensities also can give arguments
in favor of challenging the identification of monomers by SERS-CS.
Authors generally report on the nonobservation of the SERS signal
of molecules on a few monomers,5,8 however off-resonance
SERS experiments of the SAM of MBA adsorbed on spherical Ag NPs were
previously reported26 on an assembly of
∼200 dried NPs and using a Raman spectrometer having a good
spectral resolution. In our case, we measure only typically 5 NPs
at a time by using an incident power 1 order of magnitude larger and
an optical setup 1 order of magnitude brighter because of the poor
spectral resolution. Our experimental conditions are thus close to
those described in ref (26). Moreover, the dynamical approach of our experiment favors the signal-to-noise
ratio by efficiently extracting a weak signal from the background
signal27 (that does not present any correlation
signature) in contrast with static measurements, thereby enhancing
the sensitivity of our method. Besides, the EF of the dimers can be
roughly estimated from the averaged SERS intensities. The measured
SERS intensities for monomers or for dimers can be written as ISERS ∝ EF × nV × NS × % HotSpot, where EF is the EF of the monomers (or of the dimers), nV is the number of monomers (respective dimers)
in the confocal volume, NS is the number
of molecules adsorbed on the monomers (respective dimers), and %HotSpot is the percentage of the total area of the monomers
(respective dimers) where the EF is the highest. According to Figure 3, the SERS intensities
are ∼20 times larger when the dimers are identified as compared
to that of the monomers. Moreover, in the case of the dimers, the
largest EF occurs typically on 1% of the total area,28 whereas the surface of the highest EF is about 25% of the
total area in the case of the monomers.5 Finally, the concentration of the dimers in the solution is estimated
to be roughly 10% of that of the monomers, according to the extinction
spectrum of Figure 3a. Consequently the ratio of the SERS intensity measured for the
dimers to that measured for the monomers is  

According to the Mie theory, the electric
field at the surface
of a Ag 20 nm-diameter spherical NP illuminated with a 532 nm laser
is 4.5 times the incident field,29 which
gives EFmonomer = 400. This leads to an EF for the dimers
equal to EFdimer=(20 × 400 × 0.25/0.1 ×
0.01 × 2) = 106, which is the expected value in off-resonance
conditions.5,28 Last, we note that all SERS-CS
measurements performed for more than typically 20 min after addition
of the MBA never exhibited the signature of the monomer diffusion
again, even if the extinction spectra demonstrated that they were
still predominantly present in the solution. The disappearance of
the ACF of the monomers when brighter aggregates are formed is also
an argument in favor of the reliability of their measurements that,
if they were to be artifactual, would occur randomly. This preferential
observation of SERS-active aggregates, even if their number in solution
is low, also further confirms that the study of colloidal solutions
as a whole may be misleading. This shows the importance of having
a combined information on the state of aggregation of different clusters
and on the SERS activities.

Size and Shape Determination
of Aggregates Hosting Zeptomole
Adsorbate Concentration
To limit the flocculation of the
NPs during a longer time and to test the sensitivity of our method
further, the MBA concentration was lowered (50 times with respect
to the previous concentration). Ten microliters of 1.2 × 10–4 MBA ethanol solution was added to 3 mL of the colloidal
stock solution. This leads to a final MBA concentration of 400 nM
corresponding to 2.4 × 1014 molecules per mL, that
is, roughly 300–1000 molecules per NP. Upon MBA addition, the
solution seems unchanged, and the extinction spectrum measured after
an hour of MBA incubation (Figure 4a) is identical to that of the stock colloidal solution
(without MBA). The SERS spectrum recorded after the same incubation
time is shown in Figure 4b. It presents a very weak MBA SERS signal of ∼500 counts/s
at 1590 cm–1 that appears through the broadening
of the water Raman band at 1650 cm–1. Despite this
weak SERS signal and its strong convolution with that of the water
band, SERS-CS experiments performed at 1590 cm–1 present low amplitudes but undeniably measurable ACFs. The AFC measured
after 60 min of MBA incubation is shown in Figure 4c together with the one calculated using eq 1. A good agreement between
the experimental data and the calculated ones is obtained, considering
here again the diffusion of a dimer of 10 nm-radius monomers. Because
of the small amplitude of the ACF, considering a dimer of 12 nm-radius
single NP would lead to a comparable agreement. However, in both cases,
the measured ACF signs the identification of adsorption of only a
few hundreds of MBA molecules in combination with the dimeric nature
of the object hosting the molecules. It is also worth noting that
the possibility of an artifactual ACF was ruled out by performing
SERS-CS measurements on the very near water Raman band at 1650 cm–1. In this situation, the water ACF does not exhibit
any clear time decay, that is, only noise is measured (Figure 4d) despite Raman intensities
of ∼6000 counts/s much stronger than that of the MBA. In that
case, the ACF G(t) – 1 ≈
1/⟨N⟩ ≈ 0 as the number of water
molecules in the confocal volume is very large. Here again, it is
the statistical analysis of the SERS intensities, via ACFs, that permits
to effectively extract the signal of the target molecules from the
overall signal (here of water). This result is of great interest for
trace detection approaches in cases where the signal is polluted by
the residual molecules in the solutions or for identifying functionalization
processes at low adsorbate concentrations.

Only noise is observed.

Toward Single-Molecule SERS-Active Aggregates Characterization
Despite the low MBA concentration, the Ag NPs in the 400 nM MBA-NPs
solution slowly flocculate. After 4 weeks of aging, the solution turned
to a reddish color and the extinction spectrum, displayed in Figure 5a, presents a wide
and low amplitude broadening of the plasmonic band of the Ag monomers,
signing the formation of a small amount of size-dispersed aggregates
and the presence of a still significative number of nonaggregated
single NPs. SERS measurements show that this small number of aggregates
is responsible for a very large SERS signal. Indeed, the MBA SERS
band intensities reach ∼1.5 × 105 counts/s
(Figure 5b), which
correspond to an intensity ∼300 times larger than the SERS
intensities measured before the aggregation process. Figure 5c displays an ACF of the SERS
intensities of the MBA band at 1590 cm–1. Fitting
these data is more difficult than before, as aggregates of different
sizes are very likely to diffuse through the observation volume during
the acquisition. Considering a unique contribution of 4-NP chainlike
aggregates (τR = 20 μs and τD = 4.5 ms) allows to take correctly into account the rotational characteristic
time but globally leads to a poor agreement with the experimental
data (Figure 5c). On
the contrary, considering a 25-NP aggregate for which τR = 1.9 ms and τD = 15 ms (Figure 5d) gives a better agreement
but does not fit the short time decay. However, one can reasonably
assume that the aggregates in solution range within these values of
4–25 NPs, as no higher diffusion times are observed. The intensity
enhancement of a factor 300 is thus not simply imputable to larger
aggregates but is essentially due to the presence of molecules in
hot spot regions. As already mentioned, less than 1000 molecules are
adsorbed on the NPs, and this represents a coverage percentage lower
than 5%. It is consequently very unlikely that a large number of molecules
stand within the hot spots. We thus believe that the SERS intensities
leading to the measured ACF come from the scattering of a few tens
of molecules at the most. This high sensibility of SERS-CS experiments
could certainly be pushed further by creating higher SERS enhancements.
This could be obtained by inducing a more controlled aggregation,
by adding NaCl for instance, so that all single NPs coagulate to form
aggregates whose EM resonances stand in the laser line spectral region.
Such an experiment would be close to that of Kneipp et al.2 with a statistical approach given by the ACF
instead of histograms, which would allow for a larger sampling, and
thus more accurate results, and for an access to the dynamical parameters
of the aggregates. In such conditions, we believe that it would be
possible to characterize specifically aggregates whose EFs are high
enough for single-molecule detection.

Conclusions
We
have presented SERS-CS experiments performed on weak SERS signals
to highlight the high sensitivity of our experimental setup. The weakness
of the SERS signals was due to a small amount of MBA molecules adsorbed
on the Ag NPs and due to the off-resonance electromagnetic conditions.
ACFs derived from these weak SERS intensities were analyzed through
fitting procedures and using the bead hydrodynamic model. The different
ACFs permitted (i) the identification of Ag monomers decorated by
a MBA SAM, (ii) the identification of dimers covered by a zeptomole
concentration of MBA molecules, and (iii) the identification of aggregates
formed by a few tens of monomers supporting EFs large enough for a
few molecules sensing. These results, combined with the intrinsic
advantages of the technique, namely the in situ and the chemically
and SERS-active selective characterization, make SERS-CS a highly
promising analytical tool for targeted metal colloids and single NP
sensing.

Experimental Section
Colloidal Solution Preparation
Silver
nitrate (AgNO3, ACS reagent, 99%), sodium citrate tribasic
dihydrate (sodium
citrate, ACS reagent >99%), ascorbic acid (reagent grade), and
p-MBA
(99%) were purchased from Aldrich. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH, pellets,
reagent grade >98%) was bought from Fischer Scientific. Ethanol
(95%)
was purchased from Sodipro. High-purity water (resistivity of 18 MΩ
cm, Millipore) was used to prepare silver NPs and the samples. Filters
(100 nm pores size) were purchased from Sartorius.

Citrate-coated
colloidal silver NPs were obtained by the reduction of silver nitrate
with ascorbic acid in the presence of sodium citrate (stabilizer)
in basic media, as described by Qin et al.30 The reagents were mixed together by adding 5.5 mL of 27.3 mM water
solution of sodium citrate (1.9 equiv), 5 mL of 48 mM water solution
of ascorbic acid (3 equiv), and 0.5 mL of 1 M water solution of sodium
hydroxide to 80 mL of water. After stirring for a minute at room temperature,
the pH of this solution was equal to 11.2. Five mL of 16 mM water
solution of silver nitrate (1 equiv) was then rapidly added at room
temperature under stirring of 350 rpm. The stirring was maintained
for 30 min, after which the colloidal suspension was stocked in a
glass flask. Just before being used for the experiments, the colloidal
silver NP suspension was filtered through a 100 nm size filter to
remove small hypothetical aggregates present after the synthesis.
The optical density of the colloidal suspension measured before and
after filtration indicates that only 2.5% of the colloidal matter
was lost during this step.

Optical Setup
The optical setup
is schematized in Figure 6. It is composed
of a confocal microscope11 (illustrated
by the objective) coupled with a monochromator used to select the
wavelength of the photons to be detected by the avalanche photodiode
(APD). The solutions are illuminated by a linearly polarized laser
source of wavelength λ = 532 nm and power P = 100 mW at the sample. The incident beam is focused by a ×60
water immersion objective (Olympus, UPLSAPO, 1.2 NA) also used to
collect the backscattered light. The confocal configuration is ensured
by a 150 μm-diameter pinhole positioned at the image of the
focus point, which is realized by a 150 mm focal length lens tube.
In such a configuration, the observation volume is Vc ≈ 5 μm3. The Rayleigh scattering
is suppressed by a Notch filter of optical density 6.0 placed in front
of the pinhole while the Raman/SERS photons are transmitted and focused
at the entrance of a monochromator (CM110, Spectral Products) of focal
length f = 110 mm. The entrance and output slits
are 0.3 mm wide, and the monochromator is equipped with a 1200 grooves/mm
grating blazed at 650 nm, leading to a spectral resolution of ∼25
cm–1. The outgoing signal is focused on a 180 μm-diameter
APD (Perkin Elmer, SPCM-AQR-15) coupled with a photon correlator (Ciprian)
that measures the time delay between two pulses (each pulse corresponding
to the arrival of a photon). This permits to record the intensity Iλ(t) of the photons of
wavelength λ as a function of time.

Figure 6 Optical setup for SERS/Raman
spectra and SERS-CS measurements.
A laser source (λ = 532 nm) is focused on the sample (S) through
a ×60 water immersion objective also used to collect the backscattered
light. This backscattered light is focused onto a pinhole (P) in front
of which a removable notch filter is placed to ensure the rejection
of the Rayleigh scattering. The filtered signal is then focused at
the entrance of the monochromator, which selects the wavelength of
the outgoing photons to be detected by the APD. Inset: SERS spectra
of MBA measured with a T64000 Raman spectrometer (Horiba Scientific)
of focal length f = 640 mm (black) and with our optical
setup (gray). Both spectra were normalized by the Raman water band
at 3400 cm–1.

SERS/Raman Spectra
SERS and Raman spectra are measured
by scanning the grating of the monochromator and integrating, at each
position of the grating, the intensity I(λ)
over a few seconds. The relatively wide open slits, together with
a small focal length, lower the spectral resolution of the monochromator
but to the benefit of higher brightness of the setup. A typical MBA
SERS spectrum recorded by integrating the SERS intensities over 5
s per wavelength and with a wavelength step of 1 nm is present in
the inset of Figure 6. The three MBA bands, which appear at 1085 and 1590 cm–1 for the ν12 and ν8a aromatic ring
vibrations, respectively, and at 1430 cm–1 for the
νs(−COO–) vibration of the
carboxylate −COO– groups on the metal surface,20 are broadened by the poor experimental spectral
resolution, but their intensities are 20 times larger than those measured
by a conventional Raman spectrometer (here a T64000 from Horiba Scientific
of focal length f = 640 and 0.1 mm slit apertures)
and also represented in the figure. The intensities measured with
both setups were normalized by the Raman of the water band at 3400
cm–1 to enable comparison.

SERS Correlation Spectroscopy
SERS-CS experiments were
carried out by measuring the time-dependent intensity I(t) of the MBA SERS band at 1590 cm–1. I(t) presents the temporal fluctuations
due to the variation of the local MBA concentration triggered by the
Brownian motion of the MBA-covered NPs that brings them in and out
of the focus point. These fluctuations occur with a characteristic
time τD related to the time spent by the NP within
the observation volume and with amplitudes inversely proportional
to the average number of NPs present at any time in the observation
volume. When the diffusing species are anisotropic, their rotation
within the observation volume may also induce temporal fluctuations
of the measured intensities. In our case, the latter occur due to
the strong dependence of the SERS EF on the orientation of the aggregate
with respect to the exciting electric field.5 Therefore, as the aggregates turn relatively to the axial polarization
of the focused beam, the SERS intensities of the molecules are modified.
To access these translational and rotational diffusion coefficients
as well as the mean number of NPs in the confocal volume, a statistical
analysis of I(t) is done by deriving
its normalized ACF  

Following the theories developed
for
fluorescent CS31,32 and considering a confocal volume
where the light intensity profile may be described by an anisotropic
Gaussian function I(x,y,z) = I0 e–2(x2+y2)/r02–2z2/z02, I0 being the incident laser intensity and r0 and z0 being the radial
and axial 1/e2 radius of the confocal
volume, respectively, G(t) can be
written as 1  

In this model, the NPs are considered to be independent, which
means that their possible collision is not taken into account. This
assumption is justified by the low concentration of NPs and by the
fact that if NPs collision were to happen, they would give rise to
a transient SERS signal too fast to be detected. In eq 1, τD and τR are the translational and rotational characteristic times,
respectively, ⟨N⟩ is the average number
of NPs in the confocal volume, and AR is
the parameter reflecting the degree of anisotropy of the measured
NP. The other parameters do not give direct information on the NPs,
as w = z0/r0 is the shape parameter of the confocal volume and c = 1 – I/IB is the background correction factor, I being
the total intensity and IB being the intensity
of the background.33 It is from the two
characteristic times that the size and shape of the NPs are obtained.
Indeed, the translational diffusion time of a freely diffusing NP
is given by τD = r02/4DD where DD is the diffusion coefficient,34 which is inversely proportional to the hydrodynamic radius of the
NP, whereas the rotational diffusion is given by the relation τD = 1/6DR where DR is the rotational coefficient,35 which is inversely proportional to the cubic power of the hydrodynamic
radius of the NP. Only ACFs G(t)
presenting a τD and a τR corresponding
to the same hydrodynamic radius can determine unambiguously the size
and aggregation state of the NPs.9 It is
to be highlighted that the main advantage of SERS-CS experiments is
that the moving species are here the MBA-covered NPs because only
the MBA molecules that are adsorbed on the metal can produce a measurable
SERS signal and measurable fluctuations. If there were to be free
MBA molecules in the solution, their (nonenhanced) Raman signal would
be undetectable, and even then the amplitude of the fluctuations would
be too small to be measured (the Raman signal would then come from
a large number ⟨N⟩ of molecules resulting
in an AFC that tends to 1, see eq 1). As a result, the measure of a SERS-CS ACF signs
the adsorption of MBA molecules on the Ag NPs, whereas the characteristic
times of the ACF give access to the size of the NPs carrying the molecules.

DLS
Our optical setup can also be used for DLS experiments
in a confocal volume.36 In DLS, it is the
elastic scattering intensity that is measured. This is achieved by
removing the notch filter and setting the grating to the Rayleigh
wavelength λ = 532 nm. In that case, all NPs present in the
observation volume contribute to the measured signal whether or not
they are decorated by MBA molecules. A global characterization of
the colloidal solution is thus accessible by DLS. Because elastic
scattering is a coherent process, the measured intensities result
from the interferences of the fields scattered by the NPs present
in the confocal volume at the same time. These interferences depend
on the relative positions of the NPs and consequently fluctuate as
the NPs move. This additional source of intensity fluctuations appears
as an additional term in the ACF that is written as36,37 2  where τC = 1/(q2DD) is the coherence characteristic
time and q is the modulus of the scattering vector
with q = 4πn sin(θ/2)/λ
≈ 3.142 × 107 m–1, n being the solution refractive index (here water, n = 1.33) and θ being the scattering angle (here θ
= 180°). β is the Siegert coefficient, a spatial coherence
factor proportional to the ratio between the measured coherence area
(speckle) and the detector area.38 Its
value ranges from 0 to 1, the limiting values corresponding, respectively,
to (i) the case of a large detection area integrating many uncorrelated
coherence areas and (ii) the case of a small detection area measuring
a unique coherence area.

DLS on a Commercial Apparatus
DLS
experiments were
performed on a Vasco Flex apparatus model from Cordouan Company. The
samples were illuminated by a 658 nm laser source positioned at 8
cm from the samples. The detection of the scattered light by an APD
was recorded at 170° from the source. The ACF curves are fitted
with a cumulant mathematics model that gives the size distribution
of the NPs either as a function of the relative number of NPs or as
a function of the scattered intensities. The latter case favors the
signal of the bigger NPs leading to higher estimation of the hydrodynamic
radius of the NPs.

Extinction Spectra
Extinction spectra
were performed
using a SAFAS Xenus XC spectrophotometer. The spectra were recorded
at room temperature using a 1 cm path long quartz cuvette and 2 mm-wide
slits. Baseline calibration was measured using the same cuvette filled
with pure water. The solutions were diluted by a factor of 6 to avoid
absorption saturation. The spectra of the colloidal stock solution
was normalized to 1, and the same normalization factor was applied
to other measurements to make the comparison between the curves easier.

SEM
Field emission SEM images were recorded using a
Zeiss Ultra+ scanning electron microscope. The NP suspension (10 mL)
was deposited and dried on doped silicon wafers for observation.
