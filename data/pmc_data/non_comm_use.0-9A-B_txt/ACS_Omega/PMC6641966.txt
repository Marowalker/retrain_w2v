Eight
new derivatives of corannulene have been synthesized, characterized,
and examined for their water solubility and thermally triggered assembly
behavior. To achieve this, the hydrophobic corannulene core was attached
to the hydrophilic polyethylene glycol arm(s). Here, the substitution
pattern as well as the arm length was varied systematically. Furthermore,
the hydrophobic/hydrophilic ratio was adjusted by incorporating a
phenyl ring at the junction point of the two moieties. A properties
study revealed that a proper balance among the number, length, and
chemical nature of the arm was required to ensure water solubility
and thermoresponsive character. Remarkably, the lower critical solution
temperature could be modulated within the range of 30–50 °C
simply through adjusting the molecular structure of the assembling
building block. This work, therefore, demonstrates synthetic feasibility
of a wide range of amphiphilic corannulene derivatives and opportunity
for modulation of their thermoresponsive behavior.

Introduction
Amphiphilic molecules
are useful building blocks in the construction
of functional soft materials.1−6 An example of this is Moores’ phenyl acetylene macrocycles
substituted with ethylene glycol side chains.7−11 The aromatic hydrocarbon backbone in this case is
hydrophobic, and the side chains are hydrophilic. Therefore, on the
basis of the nature of the medium, such amphiphilic molecules can
associate or dissociate through solvophobic interactions.12 For example, in a polar solvent, only the side
chains have a favorable interaction with the solvent. Therefore, intermolecular
stacking occurs to give extended supramolecular structures. This design
concept of combining a hydrophobic and interactive core along with
a hydrophilic shell within a small molecule to trigger an assembly
process under favorable conditions is general and can be extended
to other molecular structures.13,14 An interesting motif
in this regard is represented by corannulene C20H10.15−18 This polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon is nonplanar and can be imagined
as a molecular bowl endowed with interesting structural and electronic
properties.19−38 Therefore, in terms of responsive soft material construction, corannulene
can play an important role as a molecular building block. However,
so far, studies in this direction are restricted to a few examples.39−44 Therefore, extending the use of this extraordinary structural motif
as a building block in the construction of functional soft materials
is a valuable research task. Such efforts will further increase our
knowledge and understanding in the arena of nonplanar hydrocarbon
chemistry.45 In this context, we have recently
shown that pentasubstitution with triethylene glycol units onto the
periphery of the corannulene bowl in a C5 symmetric fashion can lead to a thermally triggered assembly process
and formation of larger functional structures.43 Interestingly, increasing the length of the polar side
chains resulted in loss of the thermoresponsive character of the corannulene
derivatives. This observation raised many questions. Can similar molecules
differing in their substitution pattern be prepared? How will the
geometry of substitution affect the properties? Is triethylene glycol
the optimum length for achieving thermoresponse? By increasing the
ethylene glycol length, can the hydrophobic content be increased through
the incorporation of other aromatic moieties in the system? If so,
what would be the properties of the resulting materials? The present
study is a result of our investigations directed toward answering
the aforementioned questions.

Results and Discussion
Aromatic
polysulfides are an interesting class of compounds in
which the properties are determined by not only the aromatic nucleus
but also the electronic contribution from the divalent sulfur atoms
directly attached to the aromatic ring.46 In terms of corannulene being the aromatic scaffold, elegant studies
from the laboratories of Scott and Baldridge and Siegel are immensely
valuable. Scott and co-workers have employed a combination of the
two motifs to design hosts of fullerene C60.47,48 The optoelectronic properties of the persulfurated corannulene derivatives
and 10-fold sulfuration of the corannulene nucleus are described by
Baldridge and Siegel.49,50 In the present context, a single
substitution of the corannulene nucleus with an ethylene glycol-based
side chain was considered as the simplest amphiphilic structure with
which the investigations into the aforementioned questions could begin.
Therefore, to synthesize this molecule, corannulene was initially
brominated as described by Siegel and co-workers (Scheme 1).51

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Amphiphilic Corannulene Derivatives Carrying a Polar
Ethylene Oxide Arm
On the other hand, the hydroxyl group of triethylene glycol
monomethyl
ether (Tri-EG) was first converted into a tosylate (Tri-EGT) and then
into a thiol group through established synthetic protocols to afford 1.52 Thiols, when activated using
a sodium metal, produce thiolate anions. This powerful nucleophile
can then be used for a substitution reaction with halocorannulene
to establish a thio–ether linkage between the hydrophobic core
and the hydrophilic side chain.47,49,50 In this way, the simplest amphiphilic structure 2 was
prepared and isolated in an 80% yield. After achieving synthesis of 2, an increase in the polar ethylene glycol arm length was
considered. For this, polyethylene glycol (PEG) monomethyl ether (Mn = 750) was used to obtain the corresponding
thiol molecule 3. A reaction between 3 and
bromocorannulene then afforded molecule 4 in an isolated
yield of 73%. It must be mentioned that 2 carrying triethylene
glycol units is a monodisperse compound and 4 using a
longer and polymeric ethylene glycol chain is inherently a polydisperse
compound and can be considered as a polymer.

Next, to increase
the number of ethylene glycol chains on the corannulene
scaffold, 1,6-dibromo-2,5-dimethylcorannulene was used as the reactive
scaffold (Scheme 2).24 The two bromine atoms in this case would allow
for establishing two arms on the corannulene core. To accomplish this,
the same strategy described before was employed and initially triethylene
glycol units were installed to give 5 in an isolated
yield of 41%. Later, PEG units were attached to yield 6 in 16% yield. The lower yields during the preparation of longer
arm derivatives reflect upon the increase steric hindrance of the
ethylene glycol chain.

Scheme 2 Attachment of Two Ethylene Glycol Arms to
the Corannulene Scaffold
Encouraged by these results, a further addition of the
ethylene
glycol arms was targeted. For this, 1,2,5,6-tetrabromocorannulene
was used as the core compound (Scheme 3).53−55 Attachment of triethylene glycol and PEG units then
afforded four-armed compounds 7 and 8 in
36 and 46% isolated yield, respectively.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Corannulenes
Carrying Four Polar Arms
To further increase the number of arms, pentachlorocorannulene
serves as the centerpiece and allows for installation of the polar
side chains in a C5 symmetric fashion
(Scheme 4).49 Synthesis of these derivatives, 9–11, have been described by us.43

Scheme 4 C5 Symmetric Pentasubstitution of Corannulene
as Described in Ref (43)
To further modulate the chemical
structure of the amphiphilic derivatives,
introduction of a phenyl unit at the junction point of corannulene
and the ethylene glycol arms was then targeted. It was anticipated
that this approach would yield materials in which the phenyl groups
will increase the ratio of the hydrophobic content in the molecule
and will help in modulating the thermoresponsive behavior. To achieve
the synthesis, 4-hydroxythiophenol was oxidized using iodine in methanol
to afford disulfide 12.56 The
hydroxy groups of this molecule were then used to install ethylene
glycol segments and to afford compounds 13 (yield = 79%)
and 14 (yield = 63%) (Scheme 5). Reduction of the disulfide bond using
sodium borohydride gave rise to ethylene glycol chains 15 (yield = 89%) and 16 (yield = 79%) terminated with
a thiophenol moiety. A final reaction between pentachlorocorannulene
and thiophenols 15 and 16 gave rise to derivatives 17 (yield = 27%) and 18 (yield = 38%) in which
the overall hydrophobic content of the amphiphilic structure is increased
through the incorporation of the phenyl linkers.

Scheme 5 C5 Symmetric Pentasubstituted Phenylated
Amphiphilic Derivatives of Corannulene
In terms of water solubility, interestingly, only pentasubstituted
compounds 9, 10, 11, and 18 were found to be highly soluble in water. Compound 17, having the added phenyl group and a shorter PEG segment,
was not soluble in water. However, a 20% aqueous tetrahydrofuran solution
could be used to completely solubilize 17.

To study
the thermoresponsive behavior, therefore, aqueous solutions
of 9, 10, 11, and 18 in water and 17 in aqueous tetrahydrofuran were considered
(Figure 1). Although 9–11 were studied earlier,43 the thermosensitivity study was preliminary with a high heating
step (10 °C), providing a rough idea of the process with the
help of low-resolution data. Moreover, the data were recorded as the
sample was constantly being heated. In the present study, a step of
1 °C was used for high-resolution data accumulation. Moreover,
the measurements were carried out differently in which the samples
were first heated to 70 °C and then allowed to cool slowly to
20 °C, and during both processes, the transmittance was monitored
at 600 nm and recorded. Therefore, a direct comparison can now be
made between the properties of the different molecules. From this
study, it became clear that the onset of cloud point was lower for 9 (42 °C) and higher for 18 (50 °C)
(Figure 2). In the
case of 17, because tetrahydrofuran was part of the aqueous
solution, heating the sample resulted in changes in the concentration
because of some evaporation of the organic solvent. This did not allow
for obtaining the complete set of satisfactory data especially as
the temperature increased above 40 °C. However, from visual inspection
on a controllable heating plate (Figure 1) and transmittance data collected only under
heating conditions (see Supporting Information file), it became clear that 17 starts to give turbidity
at 33 °C. At this temperature, no evaporation of the organic
solvent was observed and therefore at least the onset of the cloud
point can be gauged without any issues or concerns. Compounds 10 and 11 did not exhibit any thermal response
over the temperature variation range of 20–70 °C.

Figure 1 Digital images
showing the thermoresponsiveness of 17 (top) in aqueous
tetrahydrofuran and 18 (bottom) in
water. Each upper frame differs in temperature roughly by 10 °C
and lower frames by 5 °C.

Figure 2 Transmittance as observed at 600 nm from the aqueous solutions
of 9 (blue and red) and 18 (green and pink)
upon heating and cooling the samples from 20 to 70 °C.

A final attempt was then made
to measure the thermal response of 18 in 20% aqueous
tetrahydrofuran solution for a direct comparison
with 17 which shows onset of turbidity at 33 °C
in this solution. It was observed that the aqueous tetrahydrofuran
solution of 18 remains completely transparent up to 40
°C. A further increase in the temperature results in the evaporation
of tetrahydrofuran. Therefore, the turbidity point cannot be measured
for 18 in aqueous tetrahydrofuran solution.

Conclusions
To conclude, the amphiphilic corannulene derivatives can be prepared
in good to moderate isolated yields through the attachment of chemically
polar ethylene glycol chain(s) to the chemically nonpolar aromatic
scaffold. The covalent connection between the two unlike segments
is secured through thiol–halide reaction. In this, the thiol
group is located on the chain end of methyl ether-terminated PEGs,
and the corannulene nucleus carried the chloro- or bromosubstituents.
The number and the geometry of the halide substituent determined the
number of polar arms and their relative orientation on the aromatic
nucleus, whereas the degree of polymerization determined the length
of the hydrophilic chains. To further change the ratio between the
hydrophilic and hydrophobic content, in two cases, the PEG chains
are prepared in such a manner that a phenyl group was situated between
the thiol functionality and the polymer chain. In these cases, the
final molecules boasted five added phenyl groups in addition to the
corannulene nucleus. From this family of amphiphilic corannulene compounds,
four derivatives are found to be highly soluble in water and one in
an aqueous tetrahydrofuran solution. Three structures among these
are found to be sensitive to the changes in the solution temperature.
The lowest and the highest cloud points of 32 and 50 °C belonged
to the phenyl group carrying amphiphiles, and this range was bridged
by an amphiphile in which the thiol group of the ethylene glycol chain
was directly attached to the corannulene scaffold. In essence, this
study establishes synthetic access to a new family of corannulene
derivatives carrying hydrophilic polymer chains and shows that the
thermoresponsivity in such unique structures can be modulated through
precise tuning of their molecular structures.

Experimental Section
The Tri-EG (>97%) was purchased from Fluka, PEG monomethyl ether
(MPEG) with average Mn of 350 and 750
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and the alcohols were used directly
to prepare corresponding thiols. 1H, 13C, and
DEPT-135 NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL ECA instrument by dissolving
the samples in CDCl3 and by using 400 or 500 MHz NMR instruments.
In 1H NMR spectra, the solvent residual peak of 7.26 ppm,
and in proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectra, middle peak was
set to 77.00 ppm for CDCl3. The coupling constants in 1H NMR data were reported in hertz, and the multiplicities
are reported as follows: br = broad, s = singlet, d = doublet, t =
triplet, q = quartet, and m = multiplet. All the reactions were performed
in an oven dried glassware apparatus under a nitrogen atmosphere.

F254, Merck) were used and exposed to UV light (λ = 254 and
366 nm) or iodine vapors to identify the compounds. The column chromatographic
purification was carried out on a silica gel 40–63 mesh stationary
