To strengthen the particles radial
movement and mixing, the longitudinal
vortex generator of a sphere was adopted in the spouted bed in this
study. To find the influence of the longitudinal vortex and particle
properties on axial and radial velocities of particles in a 152 mm-diametered
spouted bed, particle image velocimetry (PIV) was employed. The experimental
results show that the addition of the longitudinal vortex generator
caused the vortex movement of high-speed gas and induced a considerable
secondary fine vortex in the cross section of the spouted bed, and
the existence of longitudinal vortex significantly improved the radial
velocity of particles, compared with that of the conventional spouted
bed. Due to the effect of longitudinal vortex on particles, the phenomenon
of early dropping of particles was increasingly obvious with the rise
in bed height, and the value of axial velocity of particle phase was
negative. With the decrease in the particle diameter, the longitudinal
vortex effect of gas-driven particle movement would be enhanced. The
longitudinal vortex could enhance particle velocity under a wide range
of particle diameters, and the enhancement factor η decreased
with the rise in the particle diameter and gradually approaches to
1.

1 Introduction
In the present study, spouted beds were developed as an alternative
method to the fluidized beds; it has been extensively employed in
industrial applications (e.g., drying, mixing, coating, gasification,
and combustion).1−5 Numerous experimental studies of spouted beds have been conducted
to obtain the detailed flow behavior of particles.3−9 Devahastin et al. studied a rotating jet annular spouted bed drying
device to dry particles during the decreasing rate by an experimental
method.3,4 Prachayawarakorn et al.5 found the heat transfer behavior of the spouted bed with
three agricultural raw materials. Zhong et al. experimentally studied
the mixing behavior of particles in a large spouted fluidized bed.6−8 Qin et al.9 proposed and presented a
cold spouted bed for oil shale semicoke. The effects of various static
bed heights and particle sizes on spouting pressure drops were explored
by experiments. Sari et al.10 ascertained
the gas–solid flow characteristics in a conical spouted bed
with heavy particles. Sutkar et al.11 determined
the flow characteristics of a quasi-two-dimensional spouted fluidized
bed with a guide plate. Nagashima et al.12 figured out the effects of operating parameters of spouted fluidized
bed without and with a draft tube on its hydrodynamic behavior experimentally.
Mostoufi et al.13 adopted pressure fluctuation
signals to study the flow structure characteristics in a conical spouted
bed. Sutkar et al.14 experimentally studied
the gas–solid flow of a spout fluidized bed with draft plates
to identify the flow behavior by constructing a flow regime map by
image analysis. Wang et al.15 developed
a rectangular spouted bed with double column grooves to facilitate
solid exchange between adjacent chambers.

Recently, Zhang et
al.16 experimentally
investigated gas–solid hydrodynamics of coarse particles in
a two-dimensional spouted bed. Kiani et al.17 experimentally probed into the mixing and separation of binary mixtures
with different particle sizes and densities on a pseudo-two-dimensional
spouted bed. Parise et al.18 characterized
the flow behavior of a narrow rectangular spouted bed with biomass
particles under the simultaneous injection of a jet and pulsating
airflow. By experiments, Breault et al.19,20 determined
the gas–solid flow behavior in a rectangular spouted bed with
three initial bed heights at two different jet sizes. Moreover, the
minimum spouting velocity of a flat spouted fluidized bed was also
studied. Rao et al.21 characterized the
pressure fluctuation in a 3D spouted bed at a density of zirconia
particles. Estiati et al.22 studied the
effects of the geometry and structure of a restraint pipe on entrainment,
pressure drop, air flow rate, as well as maximum cycle time.

It is well known that the longitudinal vortex technique has been
extensively used to enhance the efficiency of heat exchangers.23−29 Ahmed et al.23 reviewed the use of longitudinal
vortex generators and nanofluids to facilitate heat transfer. Hsiao
et al.25 analyzed the T-channel micromixer
installed at the bottom of the major channel of the longitudinal vortex
generator. Datta et al.26 studied the heat
transfer behavior in microchannels using an inclined longitudinal
vortex generator by a numerical method. Ebrahimi et al.27,28 numerically researched the conjugate heat transfer and hydrodynamics
of nanofluid flow in a rectangular microchannel radiator using a longitudinal
vortex generator (LVG). Recently, Wu et al.30−32 numerically
characterized the mixing behavior of gas and particles in a spouted
bed with the longitudinal vortex effect. They also investigated the
effects of LVG with different rows on hydrodynamics in a spouted bed.

The above reviews revealed that there has been rare experimental
analysis on hydrodynamics in the spouted bed with longitudinal vortex
effects. The present study aimed to experimental analysis on hydrodynamics
in a spouted bed with LVGs. For the study of the effects of the longitudinal
vortex and particle properties on the axial and radial velocities
of the particle phase in a spouted bed, particle image velocimetry
(PIV)33 was employed. The effect of LVGs,
diameters and densities of particles on the flow behavior of particles
were studied.

2 Experimental Setup and Procedure
Figure 1 shows the
experimental device applied in this investigation. The experimental
instruments primarily include a compressor of the type GX4FF-10, a
flowmeter of the type D07-60B. The PIV system primarily consisted
of laser emitters, CCD cameras, synchronizers, as well as image acquisition
and processing software. Figure 2 presents the size and structure of the spouted beds.
As displayed in Figure 2, two types of spouted beds were adopted in the experimental study:
the conventional spouted bed (Figure 2a) and the spouted bed with one row of LVG (Figure 2b). Figure 3 displays the structure and
size of one row of LVG in a spouted bed, and the LVG is spherical
in shape. The main dimensions of the spouted bed and the characteristics
of the particles used in the experiments are shown in Table 1.

The gas generated by the air compressor
entered the spouted bed
from the bottom of the bed during the experiment. Subsequently, by
driving the gas to make the particles move, the spouting situation
in the spouted bed was observed. The laser beam was illuminated parallel
to the cross section of the nozzle at the entrance of the spouted
bed (the height of the data acquisition cross section was set to 230
mm from the entrance nozzle). Next, the camera is placed on the top
of the spouted bed to capture the flow behavior of particles. Finally,
the collected image is analyzed by dynamic studio software; the radial
velocity vector and the radial velocity distribution of the section
are obtained. Figure 4 illustrates the schematic diagram of data acquisition process in
the experiment.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Effect of Longitudinal Vortex
The
radial velocity of the particle phase in the spouted bed was ascertained
and analyzed using a longitudinal vortex generator. The movement of
particles in the cross section of the spouted bed under the action
of the longitudinal vortex was primarily investigated. Figure 5 draws the comparison of particle
vector diagrams in the cross section of two types of spouted beds.
The comparison suggests that in the absence of LVG, the radial velocity
of the particles was axisymmetrically distributed across the cross
section of the bed. The addition of LVG caused the vortex movement
of the high-speed gas flow passing through the affected region and
made the particle phase to generate a considerable secondary fine
vortex flow, the longitudinal vortex, thereby improving the radial
motion ability of the gas and the particle phase. Furthermore, the
radial mixing between gas and particle phase, particles and particles
in the spouted bed was enhanced, effectively destroying the layered
flow and flow dead zone of particles in the annulus.

Figure 5 Comparison of particle
vector diagrams in cross sections of two
kinds of spouted beds:

To enhance the comprehensiveness
of data acquisition results, three
parallel lines (Figure 6) were taken close to the baffle in the cross section and the annulus
area as the data acquisition point during the experiment; the radial
velocity values of the three lines were taken for comparative analysis. Figure 7 reveals that the
radial velocity of the particle phase shifted opposite in the spouted
bed, and the absolute value of radial velocity of the particles was
upregulated due to the existence of the longitudinal vortex in a spouted
bed. The radial velocity of the particle phase in the annulus was
noticeably higher than that in the spouting zone, suggesting that
the longitudinal vortex could effectively promote the radial movement
and mixing of the particle phase. Also, Figure 8 draws the comparison of particle axial velocities
in two types of spouted beds. The experimental results suggested that
compared with the conventional spouted bed, with the rise in the bed
height, the phenomenon of particles falling back to the bottom of
the bed earlier was increasingly significant in a spouted bed because
of the effect of the longitudinal vortex on particles, and the axial
velocity of particles turned negative, implying that most of the energy
of the inlet gas was exploited to strengthen the radial movement and
mixing under the effect of the longitudinal vortex, which led to the
downregulation in the height of the particulate fountain.

beds. (a) The location of line 1. (b) The location of line 2. (c)

Figure 9 compares
the pressure drop of two types of spouted beds. It is suggested that
compared with the conventional spouted bed, the pressure drop at the
inlet and outlet of the spouted bed with LVGs was upregulated significantly,
and the pressure drop increased by 38.6%, revealing that the LVGs
in a spouted bed not only eliminated the accumulation of particles
in the annulus of the spouted bed but also facilitated the energy
dissipation of gas and particles in the spouted bed under the radial
movement of particles caused by LVGs, thereby accelerating the pressure
drop of the spouted bed.

Figure 9 Comparison of pressure drops in two kinds of
spouted beds.

Figure 10 compares
the particle radial velocities of two types of spouted beds at different
values of Ha. It is suggested that with
the rise in the bed height, the enhancement of the radial velocity
of particles by side jets was gradually decelerated, indicating that
the enhancement of particles by side jets was largely concentrated
in the low bed region, and the energy consumption of side jets for
particle velocity enhancement was primarily concentrated in the low
bed (Figure 9a).

of particle radial velocities in two kinds of spouted
beds for different values of Ha: (a) Ha = 210 mm, (b) Ha = 230 mm, and (c) Ha = 250 mm.

3.2 Effect of Particle Diameter
Figures 11–13 draw the comparison of the
particle vector diagrams as well as radial and axial velocities in
the cross section under different particle diameters. It is suggested
that when the particle diameter was 0.72 mm, the enhancement influence
of the longitudinal vortex on particle radial motion was considered
the best. The smaller the particle diameter, the more significant
influence of the longitudinal vortex on the particle radial velocity
would be, and the larger the effect of the driving particle motion
by the longitudinal vortex would be. This finding implied that with
the decrease in the particle size, the specific surface area of particles
increased, while the gas force on each particle increased at the same
gas velocity; besides, the mass and inertia force of each particle
were downregulated with the decrease in the particle diameter. Based
on the noted factors, the decrease in the particle diameter would
lead to the enhancement of the longitudinal vortex effect of gas-driven
particle movement.

particle
diameters: (a) dp = 1.42 mm, (b) dp = 1.13 mm, and (c) dp = 0.72 mm.

Figure 13 Effects
of vortex generators on particle axial velocities under
different particle diameters. (a) The location of line 1. (b) The
location of line 2. (c) The location of line 3.

To study the effect of the particle diameter on particle movement
enhancement under longitudinal vortex conditions in depth, a dimensionless
enhancement factor of the particle velocity was defined below: 1  where
|V̅L| denotes the average value
of absolute particle velocity with the
effect of the longitudinal vortex. |V̅N| represents the average value of absolute particle velocity
without the effect of the longitudinal vortex.

Figure 14 gives
the variation of η under different particle diameters. This
figure shows that the enhancement factor of the longitudinal vortex
on particle movement under different particle diameters was larger
than 1; the enhancement factor η decreased with the rise in
the particle diameter and gradually approached to 1. This finding
implied that the longitudinal vortex could enhance particle velocity
under a wide range of particle diameters, the smaller the particle
diameter, the smaller the inertia force of the particle would be,
and the stronger enhancement of the longitudinal vortex would be.

of η for different particle diameters.

4 Conclusions
(1) The addition of LVG caused
the vortex movement of the high-speed
gas passing through the affected area and made the particle phase
to generate a considerable secondary fine vortex flow in the cross
section of a spouted bed.

(2) The radial velocity of the particle
phase was significantly
promoted by the longitudinal vortex compared with that of the conventional
spouted bed. The radial velocity of the particle phase in the annulus
was significantly higher than that of the spout region. Due to the
effect of longitudinal vortex on particles, the phenomenon of early
dropping of particles was increasingly obvious with the rise in the
bed height, and the value of axial velocity of particles was negative.

(3) The decrease in the particle diameter would lead to the enhancement
of the longitudinal vortex effect of gas-driven particle movement.
The longitudinal vortex could enhance particle velocity under a wide
range of particle diameters, and the enhancement factor η decreased
with the rise in particle diameter and gradually approached to 1.
