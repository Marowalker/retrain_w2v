A highly
efficient and recyclable catalyst, cerium-immobilized
silicotungstic acid nanoparticle-impregnated zirconia (Ce@STANPs/ZrO2), has been synthesized. The catalytic activity of Ce@STANPs/ZrO2 was investigated for the first time in multicomponent synthesis
of isatin-based imidazoles under microwave irradiation in water. Ce@STANPs/ZrO2 was used for C=O bond activation in overall reaction
to synthesize isatin-based imidazoles. The structure of catalyst was
confirmed by characterization techniques, such as Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM)/energy dispersive
X-ray, elemental mapping, transmission electron microscopy, ζ-potential
and diffraction light scattering, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric
analysis, temperature-programmed desorption-NH3, electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and inductively coupled plasma atomic
emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analyses. The recovered catalyst was
found to be efficient up to seventh cycle and was confirmed by FTIR,
SEM, XRD, EPR, and ICP-AES analyses. The advantages of the present
protocol are recyclability of catalyst, green reaction conditions,
excellent yield (94%) of the products, shorter reaction time period
(5–7 min), and clean reaction profile.

1 Introduction
In recent years, catalysis has become an attractive methodology
to make organic reactions environmentally benign and economically
feasible. Heterogeneous catalysts are of great interest because they
are easily recoverable from reaction mixture by simple filtration
and can be reused.1 Of the known heterogeneous
catalysts, heteropoly acids (HPAs) have attracted much attention because
of their high acidity, high thermal stability, and favorable redox
(acid–base) properties.2 Modification
of HPAs by exchanging their protons with metal ions, specially lanthanides,
further enhances the catalytic activity in terms of higher acidity,
selectivity, and physiochemical properties.3 Among the HPAs, silicotungstic acid (STA) has been widely used as
a catalyst in many organic transformations.4 Various metal-doped STA catalysts have also been reported with improved
catalytic activity such as stronger acidity and selectivity than that
with STA alone.3 Doping of metals on nanoparticles
(NPs) further improves the performance of catalyst to a great extent
because of their size,5 structure,6 and surface composition.7 These properties enhance the catalytic selectivity,8 activity,9 and lifetime,10 which can be exploited in many industrially
important reactions. Further, to achieve high surface area and stability
in polar solvents, STA is impregnated on to different supports, such
as polymers and silica.11

It is worthy
to mention here that among the synthesized organic
scaffolds, imidazoles are very important motifs in a number of organic
molecules and have gained significant attention due to their varied
biological and pharmacological activities, such as antiulcerative
agent,12 selective benzodiazepine receptor
antagonist,13 proton pump inhibitor,14 platelet coagulation drug in animal and human
beings15 (Figure 1), antibacterial agent,16 antitumor agent,17 as pesticides,18 CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist,19 modulators of P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug
resistance,20 and as a glucagon receptor.21 Various acidic and basic catalysts have been
used in synthesizing substituted imidazoles (Figure 2) such as silica sulfuric acid,22 acetic acid,23 ZrCl4,24 boric acid using ultrasound
irradiation,25 Yb(OTf)3,26 potassium dihydrogen phosphate,27 sodium bisulfite,28l-proline,29 and nanozirconia.30 The major drawbacks of most of these protocols
are nonrecyclability of catalyst, use of reflux conditions, prolonged
time period, use of expensive and toxic catalysts, high temperature,
and low product yields.22,23,29 To improve the reaction conditions, keeping in view above-mentioned
biological activities of imidazole scaffolds and in continuation of
our previous research work,31 we herein,
report cerium-immobilized silicotungstic acid nanoparticles-impregnated
zirconia (Ce@STANPs/ZrO2) as a catalyst to synthesize a
series of isatin-based imidazoles under microwave (MW) irradiation
in water.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization of Catalyst
The catalyst
(Ce@STANPs/ZrO2) was synthesized as outlined
in Scheme 1. The protons
of heteropoly acids are highly acidic and can be exchanged easily
by metal ions.3a The driving force for
the immobilization of Ce species on STANP therefore is greater stability
of Ce@STANPs formed as a result of exchange of protons of STANPs with
Ce cations.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Cerium-Immobilized Silicotungstic Acid
Nanoparticle-Impregnated
Zirconia (Ce@STANPs/ZrO2)
The synthesized catalyst was characterized by spectral
techniques,
including Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy
(SEM)/energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), ζ-potential and diffraction light scattering (DLS), X-ray
diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis, temperature-programmed
desorption (TPD)-NH3, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR),
and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES)
analyses.

2.1.1 FTIR Analysis
FTIR spectrum of
ZrO2 (Figure S1A) showed a broad
band at 3412 cm–1 due to asymmetric stretching vibration
of −OH group. Two bands at 1633 and 1446 cm–1 correspond to −(H–O–H) bending and −(O–H–O)
bending vibrations. A weak band in the fingerprint region at 583 cm–1 was assigned for Zr–O–H bond.32 In IR spectrum of STANPs (Figure S1B), a broad band at 3424 cm–1 had
appeared, which was attributed to −OH group, whereas Si–O
stretching band was present at 1080 cm–1. The stretching
mode of W=O bond was present at 981 cm–1,
whereas stretching modes of edge sharing (W–Oe–W)
and corner sharing (W–Oc–W) units appeared
between 800 and 900 cm–1.33 When cerium was doped in STANPs, a characteristic band of Ce–O
appeared at 621 cm–1 34 along with other bands due to STANPs and ZrO2 (Figure S1C). When Ce@STANPs was supported on
ZrO2, a broad peak at 1054 cm–1 had appeared
due to merging of stretching and bending modes of vibrations of STANPs
and ZrO2 at 1080, 981, 895, and 875, as these values lie
closely in the same range with respect to each other (Figure S1D).

2.1.2 SEM/EDX
Analysis
The surface morphology
of the zirconia, fresh catalyst, and recycled catalyst was determined
by scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis and is shown in Figure 3. The SEM image of
the catalyst showed an even distribution of Ce@STANPs on the surface
of zirconia (Figure 3a). The presence of Ce, Zr, W, Si, and O elements in the catalyst
was confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis (Figure 4a). Elemental mapping
of the catalyst (Figure 4b) confirmed the uniform distribution of all elements (i.e., Ce,
W, Si, and O) on the surface of zirconia. Further, mapping of individual
elements, viz., O (Figure 4c), Zr (Figure 4d), Si (Figure 4e),
W (Figure 4f), and
Ce (Figure 4g) was
also shown. These images confirmed formation of the expected catalytic
system, Ce@STANPs/ZrO2.

2.1.3 TEM Analysis
TEM images of ZrO2, STANPs, and Ce@STANPs/ZrO2 catalyst are shown
in Figure S2. The particles of ZrO2 were obtained free from aggregation, and most of the particles
were well separated and have defined grain boundaries, as shown in Figure S2a. The TEM image of STANPs clearly indicated
the well-separated particles (Figure S2b) with particle size of 4–10 nm, as shown in the particle
distribution curve (Figure S2d). The average
particle size was found as ∼6–7 nm. When STANPs were
supported on ZrO2, particles of STANPs were attached on
to the surface of ZrO2 (Figure S2c). The TEM image of the catalyst (Ce@STANPs/ZrO2) also
confirmed that the particles were free from agglomeration.

The
diffraction light scattering (DLS) analysis of the catalyst showed
two peaks at different positions, confirming particle sizes as ∼4–10
and ∼30–100 nm for STANPs and ZrO2, respectively
(Figure 5).

of the catalyst (Ce@STANPs/ZrO2).

2.1.4 ζ-Potential
To check the
stability of catalyst, ζ-potential of the catalyst was performed
and found to be −43.08 mV, which showed that the catalyst was
fairly stable because the minimum value for the nanoparticle samples
to be stable is reported as ±30 mV.35

2.1.5 TG Analysis
Thermal stability of
the catalyst was observed by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. The
TG curve (Figure S3) showed two-stage decomposition
due to changes occurring in the catalyst at different temperatures.
The curve showed a weight loss of 5.82% at 52.40 °C due to surface-physisorbed
water. Another weight loss of about 2.04% at 385 °C can be attributed
to the decomposition of the Keggin structure of STA accompanied by
removal of water.36

2.1.6 XRD Analysis
The XRD analysis of
STANPs, Ce@STANPs, ZrO2, fresh catalyst Ce@STANPs/ZrO2, and recycled catalyst was shown in Figure S4. A broad peak in the range of 20–30° was attributed
to Si–O–Si bond, which was the main component of STANPs
(Figure S4a).37 When cerium was doped in STANPs, some other diffraction peaks in
the range of 50–60° appeared, which may be due to Ce (Figure S4b). In XRD pattern of ZrO2, the diffraction peaks that appeared at around 2θ = 30, 35,
40, 50, and 60° belonged to (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes
(Figure S4c).38 When Ce@STANPs was supported on ZrO2, the same diffraction
pattern was obtained as that for ZrO2, with some additional
peaks in the range of 50–60° corresponding to Ce.

2.1.7 TPD-NH3 Analysis
The
total acidity and presence of acidic sites on the surface of the catalyst
was measured by TPD-NH3 analysis. The TPD pattern of STANPs/ZrO2 (Figure S5a) and Ce@STANPs/ZrO2 (Figure S5b) showed two peaks
at 240 and 570 °C, which revealed the desorption of basic molecules
from acidic sites present on the surface of the catalyst. The acidic
property of the catalyst enhanced when cerium was doped to STANPs/ZrO2 (Figure S5).

2.1.8 EPR Analysis
To get insight of
the presence of paramagnetic cerium ion in the catalyst, X-band EPR
spectrum of the powdered sample was recorded. The observed pattern
of the spectrum was anisotropic in nature, confirming the presence
of Ce3+ (4f1 system) (Figure S6). The calculated g value (2.028) indicated
the presence of one unpaired electron in the metal ion of the catalyst.39

2.1.9 ICP-AES Analysis
ICP-AES analysis
was performed to confirm the actual concentration of cerium incorporated
in the catalyst. The weight % of cerium was found to be 8.42%, which
corresponded to the loading amount of 0.6 mmol/g of catalyst.

2.2 Evaluation of Catalytic Activity of Ce@STANPs/ZrO2 for Synthesizing Isatin-Based Imidazoles
The optimum
reaction conditions were developed using several parameters, such
as screening of different catalysts and solvents, catalyst loading
on different supports, and effect of catalyst amount and temperature
on the model reaction. The reaction of isatin 1, benzaldehyde 2d, and ammonium acetate 3, affording 2-phenyl-3,4-dihydroimidazo[4,5-b]indole 4d, was chosen as the model reaction
(Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Synthesis
of 4d
Efficiency of the catalyst on the model reaction was investigated
by a set of experiments using different catalysts. First of all, the
model reaction was carried out without any catalyst and trace amount
of the product was obtained after a long period of time (Table 1, entry 1). Then,
lanthanide salts were used as catalyst, which afforded moderate yield
of the product (Table 1, entries 2–4). Among lanthanide salts, cerium chloride showed
better catalytic activity (Table 1, entry 4). However, catalytic activity was enhanced
and yield was improved with heteropoly acids, phosphotungstic acid
(PTA) and STA (Table 1, entries 5 and 6). Use of NPs (STANPs) further accelerated the rate
of reaction with improved yield (Table 1, entry 7). Doping of lanthanide-metal salts on STANPs,
i.e., use of Nd@STANPs, La@STANPs, and Ce@STANPs, reduced the time
period and afforded good yields of the product (Table 1, entries 8–10). However, Ce@STANPs
showed good result among the three (Table 1, entry 10). Concerning the surface area
of the catalyst, support materials were also used to optimize the
reaction conditions. Use of ZrO2 as support on STANPs enhanced
the yield in comparison with STANPs alone (Table 1, entry 11). On the basis of these observations,
the model reaction was carried out using Ce@STANPs with different
support materials such as SiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 (Table 1, entries 12–14). It was found that the best result
(5 min, 94% yield) was obtained when cerium was used as a doping metal
and ZrO2 was used as a support material on STANPs, i.e.,
using Ce@STANPs/ZrO2 as catalyst on the model reaction
(Table 1, entry 12).

yield.

To investigate the
effect of solvents on the model reaction, different
green organic solvents were used in various conditions. Using ethanol
and isopropanol, good results were obtained (Table 2, entries 1 and 2). However, yield was slightly
decreased in the presence of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-200, PEG-400,
and PEG-600 (Table 2, entries 3–5). When water was mixed with isopropanol and
ethanol, i.e., using isopropanol/water and ethanol/water, comparatively
good results with improved yield were obtained (Table 2, entries 6 and 7). Use of water as solvent
showed better results among all green solvents used to optimize the
reaction conditions in terms of excellent yield (94%) and a short
reaction time period (5 min) (Table 2, entry 8).

c Isolated yield.

To see the efficiency of catalyst loading on support,
variable
amounts of Ce@STANPs were supported on ZrO2. It was observed
that yield was improved with increasing amount of Ce@STANPs on support
material (Table S1). However, excellent
result was obtained when 20% (w/w) of Ce@STANPs was supported on ZrO2 (Table S1, entry 4). Further increasing
the amount of Ce@STANPs on support, slightly reduced the yield of
the product (Table S1, entry 5). From this
observation, 20% (w/w) Ce@STANPs was supported on ZrO2 for
better catalytic activity in multicomponent synthesis of isatin-based
imidazoles.

The amount of catalyst suitable to catalyze the
model reaction
had been investigated by varying the amount of Ce@SNPs/ZrO2 to catalyze the model reaction. The result showed that yield was
improving sequentially by increasing the amount of catalyst from 20
to 80 mg (Table S2). Further increasing
the loading amount of catalyst from 80 to 100 mg did not show any
remarkable change; yield was the same (94%), and time was increased
from 5 to 6 min (Table S2, entries 5 and
6). Considering this observation, 80 mg of catalyst was chosen for
the catalytic activity.

The model reaction was also examined
with different temperatures
to know the effect of temperature on multicomponent synthesis of isatin-based
imidazoles. Considering general kinetics, both rate of reaction and
product yield were improved by increasing the temperature from 70
to 100 °C (Table S3). Encouraged by
this result, the multicomponent reaction was performed at 100 °C
to get the optimal result (Table S3, entry
5).

2.3 Comparison of Efficiency of Catalyst with
Previously Reported Procedures
The efficiency of Ce@STANPs/ZrO2 in multicomponent synthesis of isatin-based imidazoles from
isatin, aldehydes, and ammonium acetate was seen by comparing the
previously reported results (Table 3). Although product yield was reported as 74–96%
by ref (29), the drawback
of this protocol was limited use of l-proline (Table 3, entry 2) because l-proline cannot be recycled. The superiority of Ce@STANPs/ZrO2 over nanozirconia was confirmed by decreasing the time from
30 to 5–7 min, temperature from 110 to 100 °C and improving
yield from 78–93 to 90–94% (Table 3, entries 3 and 5).

2.5 Reaction Mechanism
The plausible
mechanism for the synthesis of isatin-based imidazoles is shown in Scheme 4. The carbonyl group
of substituted aldehydes I was activated with cerium-doped
catalyst (Ce@STANPs/ZrO2) to form activated aldehydes II. This accelerated the nucleophilic attack of ammonia (from
dissociation of ammonium acetate) on II to form intermediate III. Another molecule of ammonia reacted with III and liberated a water molecule to form intermediate IV that reacted with activated isatin molecule V to afford
intermediate VI. Finally, liberation of a water molecule
form VI afforded product VII, separating
the catalyst.

2.6 Recycling Study of Catalyst
The recycling
study of the catalyst was done using the model reaction of isatin 1, benzaldehyde 2d, ammonium acetate 3, and 80 mg of Ce@STANPs/ZrO2 in water to afford 4d. The reaction mixture was heated at 100 °C, and after
the completion of reaction, the catalyst was recovered by extracting
the mixture with ethyl acetate, followed by filtration. The catalyst
was reused for subsequent cycles and was found to retain the catalytic
activity up to seventh cycle with over 88% conversion of the substrate
to the product (Table S4, Figure S7).

The recycled catalyst was characterized by FTIR, SEM, EPR, XRD, and
ICP-AES analyses. There was no appreciable change in the FTIR spectrum
of the recovered catalyst. All characteristic bands (1621, 620, and
547 cm–1) were retained in the spectrum, confirming
that there was no loss in the structure of the recycled catalyst (Figure S1E). The SEM image (Figure 3b) showed that surface morphology
of the recovered catalyst did not change after the seventh cycle.
The XRD pattern of the recycled catalyst (Figure S4e) remained the same, showing no structural change in the
catalyst after the seventh cycle. EPR study of the recycled catalyst
confirmed that oxidation state of cerium (Ce3+) did not
change during the course of reaction (all stages) because the value
of g = 2.028 (Figure S6a) was approximately the same (g = 2.046) (Figure S6b) in the recovered catalyst. The ICP-AES
analysis showed almost the same percentage of Ce after the seventh
cycle, indicating that no leaching of Ce occurred during the reaction
course.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
we have developed a simple, efficient, and environmentally
benign method for the synthesis of isatin-based imidazoles, employing
Ce@STANPs/ZrO2 as a recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for
the first time. The advantageous features of the present protocol
include reusability of the catalyst up to the seventh cycle, excellent
product yield, shorter reaction time period, and green reaction condition.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of Catalyst
The catalyst
was prepared in three steps according to Scheme 1. In the first step, STANPs were prepared
by a slightly modified procedure reported by Izumi.40 A mixture of STA (1.439 g), water (36 mL), 1-butanol (15
mL), and tetraethyl orthosilicate (0.2 mol) was stirred for 3 h at
80 °C. This mixture was dehydrated at the same temperature to
obtain dried hydrogel. The hydrogel was then extracted with methanol
in Sohxlet apparatus for 2 days. STANPs obtained were dried at 100
°C for 3 h. In the second step, 20% aqueous solution of CeCl3·7H2O (5 mL) was added with STANPs in water
(20 mL) and stirred for 2 h at room temperature to obtain cerium-immobilized
silicotungstic acid nanoparticles (Ce@STANPs). Zirconia-supported
Ce@STANPs were prepared by employing impregnation method. As confirmed
from previous studies that 15% (w/w) loading of HPA on zirconia showed
better catalytic activity,41 dried zirconia
powder was suspended in 15% (w/w) methanolic solution of Ce@STANPs
and stirred for 2 h and excess methanol was evaporated to dryness.
The resulting sample was dried at 120 °C for 3 h to obtain the
final catalyst Ce@STANPs/ZrO2.

4.2 General
Procedure for the Synthesis of Isatin-Based
Imidazoles (4a–l) under Conventional
Heating
A mixture of isatin 1 (3 mmol), aliphatic/aromatic/heteroaromatic
aldehydes 2a–l (3 mmol), ammonium
acetate 3 (10 mmol), and Ce@STANPs/ZrO2 (80
mg) in water was heated at 100 °C for an appropriate time period.
Reaction progress was monitored through TLC. After completion of reaction
(monitored by TLC), reaction mixture was kept at room temperature
and after reaching 25 °C, acidified with 1 N HCl to get precipitate
of a different color. The precipitate was then extracted with ethyl
acetate, washed with double distilled water, dried over anhydrous
sodium sulfate, and evaporated under reduced pressure to get crude
product, which was then recrystallized with ethanol to get pure product 4a–l. The catalyst in aqueous phase was
filtered and washed with ethanol for further catalytic use.

4.3 General Procedure for the Synthesis of Isatin-Based
Imidazoles (4a–l) under Microwave
Irradiation
A mixture of isatin 1 (3 mmol),
aromatic/heteroaromatic/aliphatic aldehydes 2a–l (3 mmol), ammonium acetate 3 (10 mmol), and
Ce@STANPs/ZrO2 (80 mg) in water was taken in G30 vial and
irradiated with microwaves at 100 °C for 5–7 min. After
each 60 s, intermittent cooling was done and meanwhile reaction mixture
was thoroughly mixed. Reaction progress was monitored by TLC. After
completion of reaction, reaction mixture was withdrawn from the microwave
oven, allowed to cool, and acidified with 1 N HCl to get precipitate.
The precipitate obtained was then extracted with ethyl acetate, washed
with double distilled water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate,
and evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain crude product, which
was then recrystallized with ethanol to get pure product 4a–l. The catalyst in aqueous phase was filtered
and washed with ethanol for further catalytic use.
