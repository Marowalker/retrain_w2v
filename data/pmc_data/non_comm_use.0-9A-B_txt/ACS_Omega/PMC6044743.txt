This
study comprises the fabrication of a radiopaque gut material
with its mechanical properties conforming to the US Pharmacopeia guidelines
giving an antimicrobial advantage for suture application, especially
in conditions such as diabetes mellitus, which has a high wound infection
rate. Schiff base cross-linking iodination of the material is evinced
by the spectroscopic studies, and antimicrobial properties owing to
released iodine are evinced through in vitro studies. Modified gut
sutures demonstrated favorable physicomechanical features such as
appropriate tensile strength (440 ± 20 MPa) and knot strength
(270 ± 20) alongside a mean radiopacity value of 139.0 ±
10 in comparison with that of the femoral shaft with 160 ± 10.
The diabetic model showed absence of clinical signs of infection,
supported by wound swab culture and the absence of necrosis in histology.
Hemocompatibility studies evinced the absence of contact platelet
activation and hemolysis alongside the customary coagulation response.
These promising results highlight the stimulating potential of the
process in the development of biomedical applications, necessitating
persistent studies for its evidence-based applicability, particularly
in diabetic patients.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Wound closure involves
the approximation of edges of a wound or
an incision using synthetic or natural materials to minimize infection
and hemostasis and to restore normal function alongside good cosmetic
outcome, depending on the location and type of the injury. Different
suture materials differ in their physicomechanical and biological
properties involving biocompatibility, degradation, knot security,
tensile strength, wound security, and workability.1 Diabetes mellitus (DM) remains a potential risk factor
in the meta-analyses of studies for immediate postoperative wound
infection, with an odds ratio of 1.53 in comparison to the normal.2 Seventy-five percent of people with DM is expected
to be from developing countries by 2025, with principal figures from
India, China, and the United States, adding an economic burden of
$490 billion for diabetic care by 2030.3 Distorted innate cellular and humoral immune defense mechanisms
with poor chemotaxis or phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear cells, genetic
vulnerability, and local factors comprising poor blood flow and nerve
damage are supposed to make diabetic candidates susceptible to wound
site infections.4

Gut suture is a
sterile absorbable surgical suture composed of
purified connective tissues, principally collagen obtained from the
bovine serosa layer or the ovine submucosal fibrous layer of intestines.
They are available in plain or chromic variety and have been used
as suture materials for many years in skin and soft tissue closure,
oral, ophthalmic, orthopedic, gynecological, and gastrointestinal
surgeries.1,5−7

Joseph Lister transformed
surgery in the late 19th century by imparting
the antimicrobial property to gut sutures by immersing them in a solution
of carbolic acid in five parts olive oil and developing chromic gut
that drastically reduced the incidence of infection, histrionically
improvising patient health while enabling surgical approaches to advance
rapidly.8 Iodine is used as aqueous or
alcoholic solutions and exerts a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity,
rapidly penetrating into microorganisms, attacking key groups of free-sulfur
amino acids such as cysteine and methionine, nucleotides, and fatty
acids, terminating in cell death. Iodine is also thought to confront
the enveloped virus surface protein and also undermines membrane fatty
acids by reacting with unsaturated carbon bonds.9

Radiopaque polymers can be used in dental prosthesis,
vessel grafts,
body fluids, and organ imaging, exploring its theranostic potential
to be detected using noninvasive imaging techniques such as conventional
X-rays and computed tomography (CT).10−13 Ligand chelation using radiopacifying
agents such as alkaline earth metal salts and polymerization of methyl
methacrylate (MMA) with metal salts of vinyl monomers such as zinc
or barium acrylates were used to prepare radiopaque polymers.14−17 Embedding of electron-dense iodine-containing compounds such as
triiodobenzoic acid and N-(2,6-diiodocarboxyphenyl)-3,4,5-triiodo
benzamide into polymers such as cellulose, polymerization of aromatic
iodine-containing vinyl monomers with monomers such as MMA and 2-hydroxyethyl
methacrylate (HEMA), and cross-linking with iodine were carried out
to deliver radiopacity.18−22

Introduction of hydrophobic nonbiodegradable polymers is known
to cause anaphylactic reactions and neurological and cardiovascular
symptoms.23−25 Leaching of the contrast agents from a physically
mixed heterogeneous composition such as BaSO4 evokes undesirable
biochemical responses such as the activation of osteoclasts.26 Moreover aromatic benzene is reported to be
genotoxic, causing DNA reactivity from free-radical-mediated oxidative
damage, mutagenicity, and clastogenicity, instigating micronucleus,
chromosomal aberrations from single- or double-strand breaks, aneuploidy,
sister chromatid exchange, and aneugenesis.27−29

The present
study aims at imparting radiopacity and antimicrobial
features to the plain gut material using 2,5-dimethoxy-2,5-dihydrofuran
(DMDF)–iodine cross-linking solution. Free amine groups of the collagen may be cross-linked by the iodine-linked
bifunctional dialdehyde such as butenedial formed by the protolytic
cleavage of DMDF via the Schiff base reaction.22,30 The cross-linked material was then assessed for radiopacity, histocompatibility,
degradation studies, antimicrobial features, and physicochemical and
mechanical characteristics for suture application. Modified material
may be helpful to curb the increasing incidence of postoperative infections,
especially in diabetic patients with altered patho-physiologic orientation,
with evidence-based support fit to the optimized quality yield to
support the altered homeostasis.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials
Chemicals
of analytical
grade including DMDF, iodine, silver nitrate (AgNO3), ninhydrin
reagent, collagenase IIa, and alloxan were procured from Sigma-Aldrich
and used without further refinement. Ethicon plain gut 2′0
sutures and Accu-Chek glucometer with advantage II strips were also
used.

2.2 Methods
2.2.1 Suture
Cross-Linking
Gut sutures
were cross-linked with a suitable DMDF cross-linking fraction ascertained
using ninhydrin assay, using glycine after treatment with alcohol
to remove the surface wax.31 Air-dried
samples were treated with different concentrations of DMDF solution
at acidic pH and heated with 0.1% ninhydrin solution in 75° water
bath for 20 min. Untreated sutures served as control, and a UV–visible
spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1601) was used to measure the absorbance
standard. Different concentrations of iodine solutions (60, 80, 100,
200, 300, and 400) were prepared in 10% DMDF as per the ninhydrin
assay result, in properly sealed glassware. Plain gut sutures were
cross-linked with the prepared DMDF–iodine solution for 30
s, rinsed in distilled water to remove any unreacted iodine, and air-dried.22,32

2.2.2 Characterization of Fibers
2.2.2.1 In Vitro and In Vivo Imaging
In vitro radiopacities
of the DMDF–iodine cross-linked gut
suture (CDI) and plain gut suture (CP) were tested against a lead
sheet of 0.06 mm thickness as control by X-ray irradiation using a
customary clinical X-ray instrument (Allenger’s 325 X-ray system,
40 kW). Ethanol-sterilized CDI sutures of desired tensile strength
properties for suture application and CP (control) were implanted
in a rabbit animal model under aseptic . Rabbits were immobilized
during scan by inoculating 0.5 mg/kg midazolam IM in the caudal thigh
muscle and scanned using a Siemens somatom spirit dual-slice clinical
CT scan.

2.2.2.2 Mechanical Testing
and Knot Strength
A universal testing machine (Hounsfield,
model H25KS, Redhill,
England) was used to evaluate the tensile strength of gut sutures
cross-linked with various strengths of DMDF–iodine. The straight-pull
and knot-pull strengths of the gut suture with 0.3 mm diameter were
tested at a speed of 55 mm/min and a gauge length of 3 cm as per the
US Pharmacopeia (USP) guidelines for tensile-strength testing of surgical
sutures.33 The percentage elongation of
the samples was also observed. Each experiment was performed in triplicate.

2.2.2.3 Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) Spectroscopy
and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
A scanning electron
microscope (SUPRA-40, Carl Zeiss, Germany) attached with an energy
dispersive X-ray spectrometer (Oxford Instruments Ltd., UK) was used
to analyze the CDI and CP samples. Elemental assay of the sample was
undertaken using EDX without gold coating. Air-dried samples were
encrusted with a thin layer of gold using plasma sputter-coating before
SEM observation. Iodine concentrations on the surface and at transverse
cross sections were analyzed by taking an average of point analysis
at various sites on different fibers.

2.2.2.4 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
Samples were
chemically characterized using PHI Versa Probe II
Scanning XPS Microprobe with monochromatic Al Kα radiation under
ultrahigh vacuum. A 100 V to 5  kV differentially impelled
argon ion gun was used for cleaning the specimen before measurement.

2.2.2.5 Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
Nexus-870 Perkin Elmer Spectrophotometer with a wavelength range
of 400–3800 cm–1 was used to perform FTIR
analysis of the CDI and CP samples after flattening them in a diamond
compression cell. All measurements were performed under controlled
humidity conditions in the absorbance mode at room temperature.34

2.2.2.6 Antimicrobial Testing
A bacterial
suspension in a nutrient broth was used for optical density (OD) measurements
for the antimicrobial activity of the iodinated collagen material
sample. Luria broth (6 mL) with 50 μL of Escherichia
coli (Gram-negative bacilli) and Staphylococcus
aureus (Gram-positive, facultative anaerobe) inoculum,
each with and without the CDI sample was kept on a shaking rotator
at 37 °C. The OD was measured at different time points within
24 h of incubation at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer. Bacterial
lawn cultures were also performed on Muller Hinton agar plates (Kirby–Bauer
method) to test the antimicrobial effect of the CDI samples. S. aureus and E. coli suspensions were seeded on distinct sterile Muller Hinton agar Petri
plates and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. The samples were organized
into a small clothlike pattern and placed on the S.
aureus and E. coli lawn
cultures, and the zone of inhibition was observed for each sample
on the subsequent day.35

2.2.2.7 Cellular Viability Study
The
cell viability and biocompatibility of the CDI sample was assayed
using MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide].
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL
streptomycin, and 1% glutamine was used to culture the 3T3 fibroblast
cell line at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment. The CDI
sample was sterilized with 70% alcohol followed by rinsing with sterile
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated overnight in DMEM media
for cell seeding. A medium without sample served as the control. The
samples were seeded with 1 mL of resuspended cell culture having 1.1
× 105 cells/mL in a 9-well plate. MTT (20 μL,
5 mg/mL in PBS) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h on specific
days. Dimethyl sulfoxide (100 μL) was added to each well to
dissolve the dark blue formazan crystals formed from the reduction
of MTT by the active cells, and the plate was kept on a shaker for
10 min. Absorbance was evaluated using a microplate reader (Bio-RAD
680, USA) with a reference filter at 620 nm.35 SEM imaging was performed on day 3 for assessing the surface
adhesion and cellular morphology of the CDI sample. The mean values
were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed
by independent-samples t-test.

2.2.2.8 In Vitro Degradation
In vitro
degradation was assessed by the change in the weight of the suture
samples on incubation in 1 U/mL collagenase IIa in PBS as the test
medium and plain PBS as the control medium at 37 °C. Vacuum-dried
CDI and CP samples of 10 mg each were incubated with the test and
control media, which were refreshed every alternate day. The samples
were gathered carefully at definite time intervals over 3 days and
vacuum-dried, following rinsing with PBS for weight measurement to
calculate the percentage change in dry weight. SEM and EDX were performed
to study the change in surface morphology and surface and core iodine
concentration, respectively, on specified days during degradation
studies. Mechanical strength assessment was performed for the CDI
and CP samples using the straight-pull method at 55 mm/min as per
the USP guidelines after 12 and 36 h. Each experiment was performed
in triplicates, and the values were averaged.

2.2.2.9 Animal Model Preparation
Investigations
on animals were carried out in adult male New Zealand white rabbits
to evaluate in vivo degradation and histologic response, in agreement
with the recommendations of the Institutional Animal Ethical Use Committee
(SRGI/COP/SAEC/AM-IITYKGP/16/01). The animals were kept well-fed under
a controlled environment with an alternate light/dark cycle. Midazolam
(0.5 mg/kg) was injected intramuscularly in caudal thigh to attain
sedation. Hair was removed from the back of the ear, and the area
was cleansed with 70% alcohol. Alloxan (100 mg/kg) was prepared in
15 mL saline and administered through an ear vein, using a butterfly
syringe by slow infusion. The treated rabbits were provided with a
sugar solution for the next 2 d to avoid potential hypoglycemic shock.
The blood glucose level was monitored daily using blood glucose test
strips, and those with blood glucose levels >250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/dL)
were used in the study. Food and water intake were observed daily,
and insulin treatment was entailed to control hyperglycemia as per
the blood-glucose-level assessment.36

2.2.2.10 In Vivo Degradation and Histological
Studies
After 7 days of alloxan treatment, the rabbits were
sedated for 30 min using an intramuscular injection of midazolam (0.5
mg/kg) in the caudal thigh. The animals were kept in the prone position,
and the implant location was shaved and cleansed with 70% alcohol.
Local anesthesia was achieved using a hypodermal injection of 2% lignocaine,
followed by the subcutaneous implantation of the CDI and CP samples
under sterile conditions through an incision of width 1.5 cm. The
wound was sutured and covered with gauze. The animals were sacrificed
on day 6 and day 12 for mechanical strength testing of implants. The
histocompatibility was assessed by taking a tissue sample along with
the adjacent tissue. It was fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS followed
by dehydrating with graded alcohol and paraffin wax embedding. Tissue
sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for cellular
response and Van Gieson stain for collagen regeneration.37

2.2.2.11 In Vitro Hemocompatibilty
The
slide method was used to calculate the clotting time by observing
the fibrin strand formation time in the capillary blood collected
aseptically. Whole blood without the sample served as control. Assays
for prothrombin time (PT), thrombin time (TT), and activated partial
thromboplastin time (aPTT or APTT) were performed to evaluate the
thrombogenic behavior of the CDI sample by keeping it in whole blood
collected in a citrate tube through central laboratory facilities.
Percentage hemolysis was quantified from a colorimetric assay after
incubating the CDI samples with blood at 37 °C for 3 h, with
gentle shaking every 30 min, followed by pelleting by centrifugation
at the rate of 3000g for 15 min. Hemolysis in distilled
water was taken as the control.38 Whole
blood without the sample was taken as reference for the study. The
international normalized ratio (INR) was calculated for the sample.
Platelet adsorption test was performed for the CDI sample by incubating
the sample in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) diluted with PBS (1:1) for
15 min, followed by rinsing with PBS to eliminate the unadsorbed platelets.
Samples were prepared for SEM (Zeiss Merlin Gemini II) after paraformaldehyde
(3.7%) fixation. A glass coverslip was taken as control.

3 Results and Discussion
Plain gut sutures
appeared even-surfaced and dark in color after
their treatment with a distinct concentration of DMDF–iodine
solution, with intensification in color on increasing the iodine concentration
(Figure 1). The optimal
DMDF concentration for cross-linking was spectrophotometrically assessed
using ninhydrin assay, which measures the free NH2 functional
group of the same. Un-cross-linked amines and alpha amino acids react
with ninhydrin producing a colored compound named Ruheman’s
purple, whose spectrophotometric quantification gives an approximation
of free amine groups.39 The absorbance
measured for the CP sample and samples cross-linked with 1 and 10%
DMDF as per the glycine standard curve was 0.5 (0.3 mg/mL glycine),
0.2 (0.1 mg/mL glycine), and 0.09, respectively. The concentration
against the absorbance value of 0.09 was not measurable on the standard
curve, which echoes the near-complete amine group cross-linking; 10%
DMDF concentration was used for further experimentation.

(b) cross-linking solution; (c) cross-linked gut suture; and (d) in
vitro radiopacity of the lead sheet (control) and 100–400 mM
iodine-treated sutures.

Iodinated gut suture may be the product of a staged chemical
reaction
involving amine moiety of the same with the difunctional butenedial
formed from the protolytic cleavage of DMDF in acidic solution (Figure 2).22,30 The electrophilic addition of molecular iodine on butenedial may
result in the formation of 2,3-diiodo butenedial, involving an intermediate
iodonium ion in acidic condition in the presence of an appropriate
Lewis base such as alkene.
Irving (1937) proposed a model of bridged halonium to elucidate the
stereospecific formation of transhalogenation products, and iodine
has proven to be a good bridging halide in comparison with other halides
giving cardinal antiaddition products.40

Figure 2 DMDF
cross-linking of free amine groups of gut sutures butenedial
intermediate.

Step-wise electrophilic
addition of iodine, which acts as a Lewis
acid to the π-bonding electrons of the bifunctional dialdehyde
(butenedial) that acts as a Lewis base, may lead to the release of
the iodide ion (I–) and thence a bridged iodonium
ion intermediate formation. Subsequent iodonium ring opening by nucleophilic
gegenion (I–) breaking the C–I bond may lead
to the formation of vicinal di-iodide (2,3-diiodo butenedial). Endothermic
iodination reaction follows multifaceted third-order reaction kinetics
in polar solvents conditional to the structure of alkene and temperature.
Several amino acids of various natural proteins such as glycine and
tyrosine also develop adducts with molecular iodine as per previous
studies.40,41

Nucleophilic attack by the nitrogen
of the free amine group of
lysine, hydroxylysine, or arginine within a collagen molecule or between
adjacent collagens on the carbonyl moiety of 2,3-diiodo butenedial
in a Schiff base reaction on the carbon of aldehyde may form C=N
bond (imine bond) between collagen molecules. The temperature-controlled
cross-linking property of DMDF in an acidic environment was exhibited
in our previous work with surgical silk sutures, where the rate of
cross-linking was enhanced with increasing concentration of DMDF.22,42

3.1 In Vitro and In Vivo Imaging
In vitro
mean radiopacity values (MRVs) were calculated using the ImageJ software
version 1.47 (NIH, USA) as the mean of five different points on a
sample, and the results are shown in Table 1. The MRV of CDI samples increased from 70
± 10 to 160 ± 10 as the iodine concentration rose from 80
to 400 mM, as demonstrated in Figure 1d. A lead sheet of thickness 0.07 mm demonstrated an
MRV of 210 ± 4, and the control sample (CP) was unremarkable.
CDI gut sutures with 300 mM iodine was instituted to be effectual
for the suture application as per the values of radio-opacity and
tensile strength, consistent with the USP guidelines and thence used
in further experiments in the study.33 The
in vivo MRV of CDI sutures on the first day on plain radiography was
140 ± 10 in comparison with that of the right femoral shaft with
160 ± 10 (p < 0.05). The MRV in conventional
CT was 240 ± 8 in comparison to that of lumbar vertebrae 250
± 1 (p < 0.05) (Figure 3).

3.2 Mechanical Testing and
Knot Strength
The key function of sutures is the approximation
of a wide range
of various tissue wounds, and thence the physiomechanical properties
of the sutures are imperative for the selection and functioning of
a suitable suture. The appropriate suture material should not rupture
unpredictably along the usage, should elongate with edema at the site
of injury, should be biocompatible, and should have appropriate knot
security and a safe biodegradation profile.8,43,44 The tensile strength and elongation percentage
of the cross-linked gut sutures are shown in Figure 4. The tensile strength and the elongation
percentage of the CP sample were 400 ± 10 MPa and 30 ± 3%,
respectively. The tensile strength and the knot-pull strength of the
CDI samples augmented from 430 ± 20 MPa (100 mM I2) to 430 ± 20 (400 mM I2) and 230 ± 10 MPa (100
mM I2) to 250 ± 10 MPa (400 mM I2), respectively,
on cross-linking with DMDF–I2. The elongation percentage
decreased from 22.95 to 12.46% as the iodine concentration increased
from 100 to 400 mM.

Figure 4 (a) Straight-pull and knot-pull tensile strength of the
CP sample
shown for zero iodine concentration and of CDI samples for increasing
iodine concentration, and (b) change in the elongation percentage
of cross-linked gut sutures.

Increment in the tensile strength and reduction in the elongation
percentage of fibers were noticed with increase in the iodine concentration
in the cross-linking solution. This result can be explained by the
breakage of intermolecular hydrogen bonding and polyiodide absorption
in the amorphous protein regions changing the structural conformation.
Molecular mobility is distorted by intramolecular or intermolecular
cross-linking by altering the organization, increasing the rigidity
of the fibers, decreasing the melt flow within the natural polymer,
and hence declining the elongation percentage.41 Excessive cross-linking caused the
deterioration of the physiomechanical properties of the sutures.45

3.3 SEM and EDX
SEM
demonstrates a smooth
surface morphology of the CP sample when compared with CDI as shown
in Figure 5a,b. DMDF–I2 cross-linking may have instigated superficial roughing and
specks seen on the fiber surface. According to the EDX results, the
atomic weight percentage of iodine on the surface and the core of
the CDI sample is 30 and 8, respectively, pertaining to carbon and
oxygen (Figure 5d),
and the CP sample is devoid of iodine. The presence of iodine in the
crux attributes to in situ cross-linking reaction from the surface
to the core.

Figure 5 Surface morphology of (a) CP sample and (b) CDI sample
using SEM
(scale bar = 10 μm), (c) EDX analysis of the CP sample, and
(d) EDX analysis of the CDI sample.

3.4 XPS
Collagen is a protein with regular
repetition of amino acids (glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline) and
high glycine content, stabilizing the left-hand helix by expediting
hydrogen bonding and intermolecular cross-linking with a relatively
high carbon content on the surface as evidenced by dichroic studies.46 The spectra of the CDI sample exhibit peaks
of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen levels at 285.56, 398.4, and 531.2
eV, respectively, in consonance with prior studies. The 3D XPS spectra
of the CDI300 sample demonstrate a peak split which is
in agreement with the 3d orbital split of iodine to 3d3/2 and 3d5/2, with energy levels around 619.3 and 631.8
eV, respectively (Figure 6a).47 The presence of the covalently
bound iodine and the absence of ionic iodine confirm the results of
previous studies of C–I covalent bond, which is manifested
by these binding energy levels.48

of CP and CDI samples using (a) XPS and
(b) FTIR spectroscopy.

3.5 FTIR Analysis
The polypeptide chain
configurations of the plain gut and the cross-linked one are exemplified
by the characteristic absorption band study corresponding to the molecular
conformation as per the FTIR spectrum (Figure 6b). The results indicate that the cross-linked
suture materials maintained the triple helical arrangement of the
collagen. The CP sample demonstrated bands at 1658, 1550, and 1244
cm–1, characteristic of the amide I, II, and III
bands, respectively. Amide I bands (1658 cm–1) result
from C=O stretching vibrations, amide II bands (1550 cm–1) arise from
the N–H bending vibrations coupled to C–N stretching
vibrations, and amide III bands (1244 cm–1) correspond
to the combination peaks between N–H deformation and C–N
stretching vibrations.49 The absorption
bands of amide I, amide II, and amide III shifted to 1662, 1552, and
1247 cm–1, respectively, on CDI cross-linking, which
is ascribed to the change in the molecular structure. Additionally,
a shift to higher frequencies in the amide bands designating the cross-linking
may be the result of the coordinate or H-bonding interactions of the
amide nitrogen.34,49,50 The distinguishing absorption bands of newly formed C=N and
C–N bonds owing to cross-linking with DMDF are overlapped by
those of amide I, amide II, and amide III. C–H bending vibrations
of the methyne group (1000–650 cm–1) stemmed
from the absorption bands at 894 and 961 cm–1 in
the CP sample and 902 and 969 cm–1 in the CDI sample.22,49 Intra- and inter-molecular cross-linking of the aldehyde group of
butenedial with the free amine groups of the collagen via the Schiff
base reaction might have resulted in the new peaks. An additional
peak of alkyl halide stretching (C–I) is seen at 498 cm–1 in the CDI sample.51

3.6 Antimicrobial Studies
The antimicrobial
property of the iodinated collagen-based samples is accredited with
the presence of iodine, and OD of the bacterial cultures augmented
slowly up to 4 h followed by the growth of OD only in the control.9,52 The OD values of E. coli cultures with the CDI sample were less than that of S. aureus. The OD values calculated for the CDI sample
in S. aureus at 24 h (1.2 ± 0.02)
were significantly lower than the control (1.9 ± 0.01) (p < 0.01). Similarly, the OD values for the CDI sample
for the E. coli culture (1.1 ±
0.01) were substantially lower (p < 0.01) than
the control (2.1 ± 0.01) at 24 h (Figure 7e). An irregular zone of inhibition was seen
around the sample on the Petri plates after 24 h of incubation, as
shown in Figure 7a,b.
Iodine preparations, which have a vital role in the prevention of
surgical site infections, are thought to provide the antimicrobial
property mainly by rapidly penetrating the cell wall, unlike antibiotics
that use definite molecular pathways, making them less susceptible
to resistance.9,53

3.7 Cell
Viability
The cytotoxicity of
the CDI sample was assessed using MTT assay, which involves the quantitative
estimation of living cells from the formation of dark blue formazan
crystals due to mitochondrial enzyme activity.54 Absorbance values were measured on
the first, third, and fifth day of the assay (Figure 7f). Absorbance was pre-eminent for the CDI
samples when equaled to that of the control, indicating the increased
proliferation of the 3T3 fibroblast cell line on the former. The OD
value for CDI samples was measured to be 1.5 ± 0.06, which contrasted
with the control value of 1.2 ± 0.02 by the fifth day. The relative
growth rate of cells on the CDI sample pertaining to the control was
estimated to be (OD of test – OD of control)/(OD of test).22 A high relative growth of 65% was observed on
the CDI sample, which shrank progressively to 22% by the fifth day,
which could be due to the comparatively early confluence of cells.
The SEM images illustrate the CDI sample with a fibroblast cell attachment
on the surface alongside interconnections and multipolar polygonal
morphology, which is in compliance with the noncytotoxic behavior
of the same.50 The binding of iodine to
an additional molecule makes it safe for clinical applications, aiding
in the sustained release of iodine from the reservoir, as an alternative
to high concentrations discharged in a single application52 (Figure 7c,d).

3.8 In Vitro Degradation
Several proteases
associated with inflammation comprising the endopeptidase cathepsin
B and collagenase may be present at the wound site, catalyzing the
hydrolysis of polypeptides. In the present investigation, in vitro
degradation studies were undertaken using the collagenase IIa enzyme,
which cleaves the bond between any neutral amino acid and glycine
in a peptide sequence, degrading the triple-helical native collagen.55 Dry weight measurement of samples was taken
every 12 h, which gave the percentage weight loss following incubation
at 37 °C. The CDI and CP samples showed a weight loss of 46 ±
1 and 57 ± 0.9%, respectively, (p < 0.01)
at the end of 60 h and a reduction in tensile strength to 27 and 19%,
respectively, over 36 h (Figure 8a,b).

Figure 8 (a) Percentage of weight loss for CDI and CP samples in
the collagenase
IIa enzyme over 60 h. The control represents the samples in PBS; (b,c)
in vitro and in vivo tensile strength reduction for the CDI and CP
suture samples over 12 days; and (d,e) SEM images depicting the degradation
of the CDI and CP samples in the collagenase IIa enzyme (scale bar
= 1 μm).

A small defect has an
enormous effect on the strength of the fiber
without having much influence on the fiber weight, and hence, tensile
strength assessment appears to be more sensitive than other parameters
in the evaluation of degradation.56 The
molecular weight of collagenase is 109 000, and the water content
of the plain gut ranged from 45 to 60 wt %. The enzymatic hydrolysis
of the suture is proposed to occur from its surface to the core despite
the water present inside of the fiber, because of the large size of
the enzyme molecule preventing its diffusion into the fiber and the
poor water content of the swollen fiber. The reduction in mechanical
strength reported in the degradation studies can be explained by the
progression of defects at random sites of enzymatic cleavage along
the fiber.55 The CDI fibers in the degradation
study appeared to be swollen and exhibited a coarse surface architecture
with gradual emergence of fissures, specks, and accretions, which
is attributed to the gradual surface proteolysis of the X–Gly
peptide bonds by the enzyme collagenase.57 The local defects thus created also diminish the mechanical property
of the material.

3.9 In Vivo Degradation and
Histological Studies
The rabbits with implanted CDI samples
were healthy with no evident
symptoms of acute inflammation such as rubor, calor, and tumor on
clinical examination. The CDI and CP samples exhibited attrition of
tensile strength to 20 and 16%, respectively, over 12 days (Figure 8c). Wound swab cultures
were negative for pathognomonic organisms. Tensile strength degradation
was found to be low (p < 0.05) for the CDI samples
compared with CP in in vitro and in vivo studies over 12 d. CP sutures
preserved substantial tensile strength for approximately 4 to 5 days.1,43,44 In vivo and in vitro studies
show considerable preservation of tensile strength until 12 days unlike
plain gut sutures, which makes them befitting for mucosal applications
that requires extended duration of wound security, abolishing the
need for suture removal. It also results in the greatest amount of
tissue reaction of all absorbable sutures. Tissue samples manifested
neovascularization and histological response on day 12; the sections
revealed suture remnants surrounded by fibrous tissue and multinucleate
giant cells with macrophages indicative of foreign-body-type tissue
reaction in the case of CDI samples.42 No
evidence of tissue edema and necrosis was observed. The CP samples
were almost completely absorbed, leaving a few remnants and structured
fibrous tissue replacing the damaged connective tissue alongside angiogenesis,
indicating tissue healing. Minimal mononuclear cell infiltration was
seen around the sample (Figure 9b,f). This was supported by VG staining, which showed more
extensive and organized collagenous fibrosis (reddish brown color)
for the pristine gut samples than the processed ones (Figure 9c,g). The results were in congruent
with the histocompatible nature of the sample.42

and (e–h) blue arrow indicatingthe platelet clumps on coverslips
(control) (red star, arrow head, cross, and arrow indicate neovascularization,

respectively).

3.10 In Vitro
Hemocompatibility
Hemocompatibility
assessment was performed to know the influence of the processed material
on the coagulation cascade involving intrinsic, extrinsic, and common
pathways for vascular application.38 The
PTs for citrated blood with and without the CDI sample were found
to be 12.1 and 12.8 s, respectively, with the laboratory reference
of 12.5 s. The INR was found to be 0.97 for the CDI sample. The aPTT
and TT with and without the CDI sample were found to be 37.3 s and
36.5 s, and 12.9 s and 12.3 s, respectively, within the normal range.
Normal PT and INR values of the blood specimens with CDI sample preclude
any clotting factor inhibitory action and support favorable the clotting
profile through the extrinsic or tissue factor pathway. A high INR
indicates a higher risk of bleeding, whereas a low INR suggests a
greater risk of developing a clot.38,58 The aPTT quantifies
the pace at which blood clots through two sequential series of biochemical
reactions known as the intrinsic or contact activation pathway and
the common coagulation pathway. The thrombin clotting time, also known
as TT, quantifies the time taken for the clot formation in the blood
sample containing the anticoagulant, after an excess addition of thrombin.
The normal values of aPTT and TT exclude any atypical impact on the
same.38 The whole blood displayed fibrin
strand formation on the glass slide (clotting time using the slide
method) in 320 s in comparison to 340 s in the case of the CDI sample.
The results are suggestive of the integrity of the intrinsic coagulative
pathway on contact with the nonendothelial suture surface.59,60 Thrombus formation initiates platelet adsorption on the material
surface and its activation. The membrane damaging potential of the
CDI sample surface was evaluated through the colorimetric assay for
hemolysis, which demonstrated a meager value of 2.1 ± 1% in comparison
with distilled water (control). Nonactivated disc-shaped platelets
were discretely distributed on the CDI sample surface in comparison
with the platelet aggregate, suggestive of platelet activation observed
on the control (glass cover slip), as shown in Figure 9.60

4 Conclusions
The plain gut-based absorbable suture is
used in general soft tissue
approximation and ligation in general closure, oral, ophthalmic, orthopedic,
obstetric, and gastrointestinal surgeries, owing to its physicochemical
and biological properties, depending on the patient condition, surgical
experience, surgical technique, and wound size.1,5−7 Diabetic patients,having impaired immune function
and the inflammatory response are highly susceptible to infections
in the immediate postoperative period. In the present study, DMDF–I2 cross-linking method was performed to provide significant
radiopacity to the plain gut sutures with added antimicrobial and
hemocompatibility features, maintaining the inherent mechanical strength
for envisioned surgical utilization, particularly in diabetic patients.
The results demonstrate good biocompatibility supported by initial
in vitro and in vivo histocompatibility studies in a diabetic rabbit
model alongside admirable mechanical and handling properties of the
resultant product in accordance with the USP recommendation. Radiopacity
and tensile strength enhanced with increase in the iodine concentration
in the DMDF–I2 solution. The minimum strength required
for clinical application as per the USP guidelines is 14.1 MPa. CDI
(300 mM I2) sutures (2′0) with 444.84 ± 23.3
MPa straight-pull tensile strength, 265.66 ± 16.8 MPa knot-pull
strength, and an MRV of 139.0 ± 12.5 in comparison with the right
femoral shaft having a value of 161.4 ± 11.3 were found to be
most suitable for suture application. Preliminary hemocompatibility
studies precluded thrombogenic and hemolytic features of the cross-linked
gut material, evidencing normal coagulation cascade, which is vital
for vascular applications. The material is easily processed via an
economical procedure and has good visibility owing to the dark color
attained following iodination, which precluded the need for additional
dyes, and antimicrobial property owing to linked iodine release.

The results emphasize the stimulating potentials of the study in
developing absorbable radiopaque, antimicrobial, hemocompatible, medical-grade
polymers for biomedical applications such as surgical hernia mesh
implants, embolic agents, sieves, and stents (vascular, urethral,
or biliary), especially in immunocompromised conditions such as DM,
simultaneously opening a theranostic realm in postoperative noninvasive
follow-up.
