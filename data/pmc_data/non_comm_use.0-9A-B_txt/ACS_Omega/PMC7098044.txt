This
work reports for the first time the preparation and performance
of a nanosensor for the simultaneous detection of metanil yellow and
fast green, which are toxic food dyes. For the development of this
sensitive platform, the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE)
was modified with calixarene and gold nanoparticles. The sensing ability
of the designed nanosensor (calix8/Au NPs/GCE) was tested by cyclic
voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy. The influence of a number of parameters was investigated
for optimizing the conditions to achieve the best response of the
target analytes. Due to the synergistic activity of calix[8]arene
and Au nanoparticles, the calix8/Au NPs/GCE nanocomposite was found
to significantly enhance the signals of the selected food dyes in
comparison to bare GCE. Under optimized conditions, limits of detection
for metanil yellow and fast green were found to be 9.8 and 19.7 nM,
respectively, at the calix8/Au NPs/GCE. The designed sensing platform
also demonstrated figures of merit when applied for the sensing of
food dyes in real water and juice samples. Moreover, high percent
recovery, reproducibility, and stability suggested applicability of
the designed electrochemical platform for real sample analysis.

1 Introduction
A number of synthetic dyes are illegally added into food items
for imparting bright colors that render food more appealing for consumers.
The dyes such as metanil yellow and fast green (FCF) are banned by
food regularity authorities,1 but even
then, these are added into a lot of food commodities, sauces, chili
products, ice creams, soft drinks, and juices. The presence of toxic
dyes in food products poses a serious threat to human health. For
instance, the banned food additive metanil yellow is an established
mutagen, which is classified as category II toxin by WHO.2 This dye is blamed for cancer development and
damage to gastric mucin.3,4 Similarly, the prohibited
food additive fast green has also been reported to inhibit the release
of neurotransmitters and cause sarcoma, respiratory tract problems,
and skin irritation.5 Despite these grave
health problems, synthetic dyes are used in food products owing to
their much lower price than natural dyes. Hence, for public health
and quality control assurance, it is necessary to design sensitive
analytical tools for monitoring the presence of toxins in food samples.
In this regard, a number of analytical techniques such as high-performance
liquid chromatography, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry,
Raman spectroscopy, etc., are extensively used in food safety laboratories.
However, complicated procedures, requirement of expert personnel,
and comparatively higher cost6 have compelled
the stakeholders to invest on the development of compact, simple,
and efficient sensing devices that could offer a multitude of advantages
in terms of precision, selectivity, robustness, easy fabrication,
good sensitivity, minimal power requirement, specificity, reproducibility,
and short analysis time.7−10 In this context, electrochemical sensors have emerged
as analytical tools of ideal choice due to their improved selectivity,
miniaturization, and high sensitivity.11,12

Nanomaterials-based
electrochemical sensors are an emerging class
of sensing tools that find applications in environmental monitoring,
food analysis, and disease diagnostics.13−18 Nanoparticles (NPs) of different sizes and shapes are mostly employed
in the recognition layer of electrochemical sensors. Gold NPs are
particularly used in electrochemical and colorimetric sensors due
to their good electrical and optical properties.19−24 The binding propensity of Au NPs with suitable ligands is utilized
for the preparation of active surfaces for sensing applications.25−27

After crown ethers and cyclodextrins, calixarenes are known
as
the most studied host systems.28 These
are used in the preparation of stationary phases, ion transport membranes,
self-assembled monolayers, electrode ionophores, and sensors.29,30 Calixarenes are considered as nanobaskets. The macrocyclic cavity
in their structure can encapsulate guest molecules.31 The functional groups in calixarenes can bind to molecules
selectively via hydrogen bonding, specific stacking, or electrostatic
interactions. Due to these unique features, calixarenes are used as
electrode modifiers for enhancing the selectivity and sensitivity
of the electrodes.32,33 In the present work, calix8 has
been used as a component of the recognition layer by virtue of its
electrode anchoring and host trapping abilities. Au NPs have been
chosen as another component of the recognition layer because these
can provide a high surface area and facilitate electron transfer between
a wide range of electroactive species and electrode materials.34 Calixarene is used in combination with gold
nanoparticles as these act synergistically to impart the electrode
with qualities of molecular recognition and efficiently respond to
the redox events of target analytes.35 Keeping
these features in consideration, GCE was modified with calixarene
and gold nanoparticles (calix8/Au NPs/GCE). The designed electrochemical
platform was used for the sensing of two food toxins: metanil yellow
and fast green (see Scheme 1). The literature survey reveals that, so far, no report is
available on the simultaneous detection of these food dyes. Hence,
the current work is an effort to contribute in bridging this literature
gap and to provide evidence-based information to the stakeholders
of food safety laboratories.

2 Experimental
Section
Metrohm Autolab PGSTAT302N was used for testing the
performance
of the designed electrochemical sensing platform, i.e., calix8/Au
NPs/GCE. Experiments were conducted in an electrochemical cell using
bare and modified GCE as the working electrode, platinum wire as the
counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl immersed in saturated KCl solution
(3 M) as the reference electrode. Analytical grade metanil yellow
and fast green were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany).
The calixarene 8-hydroxy-8-propoxy-calix[8]arene was obtained from
Fluka (Shanghai, China) and used as received. Gold nanoparticles (Au
NPs) were synthesized by following the literature-reported method.36 Bare GCE was cleaned prior to every experiment
for obtaining a suitable shining surface.37,38 For this purpose, the GCE was polished by rubbing with 0.05 μm
alumina-water slurry over a rubbing pad to get a lustrous surface.
To avoid grooving on the surface of GCE, it was rubbed in a manner
of digit 8, which removed unwanted sticky particles. The electrode
was then sonicated and rinsed thoroughly with a jet of doubly distilled
water. The cleaned GCE was then subjected to several potential scans
in the range of 0–1.4 V for achieving reproducible cyclic voltammograms.39 For modification of the GCE surface, a 3 mg/mL
calix8 solution was prepared in DMF. A 5 μL droplet of this
solution was put on the surface of GCE and dried under a drier. The
as-prepared calix8/GCE was then rinsed with water for the removal
of any loosely bound molecules of calix8. For immobilizing Au NPs,
the calix8/GCE was kept dipped in the suspension of Au NPs for 20
min. The resulting electrode (calix8/Au NPs/GCE) was dried in an argon
environment and applied for the detection of the selected food toxins,
i.e., metanil yellow and fast green.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 EIS Using Bare and Modified
GCE
The
electronic transduction ability of the bare and modified electrodes
was investigated in a solution containing 5 mM K3[(FeCN)6] as a redox probe. EIS measurements were carried out in the
frequency range of 1 Hz to 14 kHz at 10 mV amplitude. The obtained
EIS data are shown in Figure 1A as Nyquist plots. The semicircular segment relates to charge
transfer resistance (Rct), while the linear
segment relates to the Warburg impedance. Charge transfer resistance
is judged from the diameter of the semicircle. A larger diameter of
the semicircle at calix8-modified GCE in comparison to the bare GCE
suggests that calix8 hinders charge transport of the redox probe.
This result could be attributed to the fact that calix8, being a macrosized
molecule, may form a compact layer on the electrode surface, thus
prohibiting efficient charge transduction of the redox probe. By modifying
GCE with either Au NPs or calix8 Au NPs/GCE, the diameter of the semicircle
decreases, entailing a decrease in charge transfer resistance. Maximum
reduction in the Rct value can be noticed
at the calix8/Au NPs/GCE. The increase in the charge transfer process
can be related to the synergistic effect of Au NPs and calix8. Au
NPs have good electrical properties and calix8 can preconcentrate
the redox probe at the electrode–electrolyte interface as calix8
molecules offer their unique macrocyclic cavity for host–guest
complexation.32,35,40

GCE with calix8, Au NPs, and calix8/Au NPs in a solution containing
5 mM K3Fe(CN)6 as a redox probe. (B) Equivalent
circuit model.

An equivalent circuit model shown
in Figure 1B involving
a resistor, inductor, capacitor,
Warburg impedance, and constant phase element was fitted to the experimental
data. The parameters obtained from EIS data are listed in Table S1. The difference in the impedance parameters
of the modified and unmodified GCEs points toward successful electrode
fabrication. A gradual decrease in the charge transfer resistance
value upon modification of the electrode surface with either gold
nanoparticles or calix8/Au nanoparticles indicates faster charge kinetics
on these modified electrodes due to reduction of the interfacial barrier
to electron transfer as compared to bare GCE. The smallest value of Rct for calix8/Au NPs/GCE points to the enhanced
electron transfer ability of these nanocomposites as compared to GCE
modified with either Au NPs or calix8 alone. Thus, calix8/Au NPs/GCE
was selected as the sensitive platform for the investigation of target
analytes.

3.2 Voltammetric Analysis
3.2.1 Differential
Pulse Voltammetry of Metanil
Yellow and Fast Green (FCF)
Differential pulse voltammetry
(DPV), being a highly sensitive electroanalytical technique, is generally
used to get the signals of analytes with enhanced resolution. Therefore,
in the present work, DPV was used for recording of the voltammetric
signatures of metanil yellow and FCF at bare and modified electrodes
at a scan rate of 5 mV/s in the potential window of 0–1.2 V,
keeping the pulse amplitude and width of 50 mV and 70 ms, respectively.
An observation in Figure 2A,B reveals that metanil yellow and FCF oxidize at 0.58 and
0.84 V, respectively. Among the bare GCE, calix8/GCE, Au NPs/GCE,
and calix8/Au NPs/GCE, the maximum current response can be noticed
at calix8/Au NPs-modified GCE due to the synergistic contribution
of Au NPs (highly electroactive surface area and good electrocatalytic
activity) and calixarene molecules (host–guest complexation
properties).

Figure 2 Differential pulse voltammograms of (A) 40 μM metanil
yellow
and (B) 40 μM FCF at (a) a modified electrode in 0.1 M PBS (pH
6.0) + solvent with no metanil yellow/FCF, (b) calix8/GCE, (c) bare
GCE, (d) Au NPs/GCE, and (e) calix8/Au NPs/GCE in 0.1 M PBS buffer
of pH 6.

After ensuring the position of
the oxidation signals of individual
metanil yellow and FCF, both of these analytes were investigated simultaneously.
The voltammetric response of a mixture of metanil yellow and FCF can
be seen in Figure 3. The current intensities are maximum at calix8/Au NPs/GCE. These
results are in good agreement with the EIS findings, as discussed vide supra. The role of calixarene and Au NPs can be considered
like a stepping stone that facilitates electron transfer between the
transducer and analytes. Upon application of the positive potential,
the electrode is expected to attract electrons from the modifier and
polarize its atoms. As a result, the modifier will attract electrons
from the oxidizable moiety of the analyte, and in this way, the modifier
acts as a bridge between the electron-donating moieties of the analytes
and acceptor electrode due to application of the positive potential
via a potentiostat. This interaction between the modifier and the
dye results in enhancement of the signals of the respective dyes at
the modified GCE by supporting host–guest interactions that
lead to an increased concentration of the dyes near the vicinity of
the electrode for enhanced voltammetric response, as is evident from
the intense current signals shown in Figure 3. Hence, the analyte enrichment ability of
the modified electrode is significantly greater than the GCE. A hopping
mechanism of electron transfer between the dye molecules and the transducer
is proposed11 in the presence of a multilayer
mediator. In hopping electronic transport, the respective dyes on
oxidation lose electrons to the polarized atoms of gold NPs as a consequence
of the applied positive potential on GCE. These electrons may then
transfer from atoms of Au NPs to acceptor sites on calixarene and
eventually to the GCE.

GCE in PBS (pH 6.0 + solvent) with no metanil yellow and FCF and at
(b) calix8/GCE, (c) bare GCE, (d) Au NPs/GCE, and (e) calix8/Au NPs/GCE
in PBS buffer of pH 6 with 50 μM metanil yellow and FCF.

3.2.2 Cyclic Voltammetry
The voltammetric
behavior of metanil yellow and FCF was also studied at various scan
rates ranging from 25 to 250 mV/s. The information about signal intensity
and scan rate can be related to either surface-assisted or diffusion-controlled
electrochemical processes.9,41 Therefore, the effect
of different scan rates on the anodic peak currents of metanil yellow
and FCF was probed at calix8/Au NPs/GCE by cyclic voltammetry. The
corresponding cyclic voltammograms are shown in Figure 4. The linear variation of the intensity of
the peak current values with scan rate suggests surface-controlled
oxidation of both metanil yellow and FCF on the surface of calix8/Au
NPs/GCE42,43 (see Figure S1A). The plots shown in Figure S1B were
obtained according to the following expressions 1   2  

Figure 4 Cyclic voltammograms
of 50 μM metanil yellow and FCF in 0.1
M PBS of pH 6 using calix8/Au NPs/GCE at various scan rates ranging
from 25 to 250 mV/s.

The literature survey
reveals that, if the slope of log of peak
current as a function of log of scan rate is equal to 1, then the
electron transfer mechanism is controlled purely by adsorption, whereas
a value of 0.5 suggests a diffusion-controlled mechanism.43,44 In eqs 1 and 2, the slope values between 0.5 and 1 suggest that
the electrode process involves contribution of both adsorption and
diffusion of the analytes.45 However, adsorption
is the dominant process, as depicted by the higher values of correlation
coefficient of the plots of the peak current versus scan rate (Figure S1A) than the R2 values of the plot of the peak current versus square root of scan
rate (Figure S1C).

3.2.3 Condition Optimization
3.2.3.1 Influence
of Supporting Electrolyte, pH,
and Accumulation Time
For condition optimization, the supporting
electrolyte was examined first since it influences both the peak current
and shape. Figure 5A,B demonstrates differential pulse voltammograms of a mixture of
metanil yellow and FCF in different supporting electrolytes such as
0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), acetate buffer, Britton–Robinson
buffer (BRB), H3PO4, HCl, NaCl, and NaOH. The
well-defined peak and higher current intensity demonstrate that 0.1
M PBS (pH 6.0) is the most suitable one among the tested supporting
electrolytes. Thus, PBS was chosen for the investigation of the simultaneous
sensing of target analytes for further studies.

Figure 5 Effect of various supporting
electrolytes on the DPV peak current
response of (A) 30 μM metanil yellow and (B) 30 μM FCF
using calix8/Au NPs/GCE at a scan rate of 5 mV/s.

To examine the effect of pH on the position and height of oxidation
signals of metanil yellow and FCF, the pH of the solution containing
PBS was varied from 5.0 to 8.0. An observation in Figure 6 reveals strong pH dependency
of the signals of metanil yellow and FCF with a maximum peak height
in a medium of pH 6.0. Figure S2A,B indicates
the trend of Ip and Ep variation as a function of the pH values. The shift
of peak potentials toward less positive values with an increase in
pH suggests facile abstraction of electrons and protons at higher
pH values.46,47

Figure 6 Differential pulse voltammograms of a
solution containing metanil
yellow and FCF using calix8/Au NPs/GCE in PBS of different pH values
(5–8).

Prolonging the accumulation time
can increase the amount of dyes
loaded onto calix8/Au NPs/GCE and lead to peak intensification, as
shown in Figure S3A. The height of the
peak significantly enhanced on extending the accumulation time from
5 to 70 s. The highest peak currents of metanil yellow and FCF at
an accumulation time of 70 s suggest attainment of electrode surface
saturation because further increase in accumulation time (see Figure S3B) showed no increase in current. Thus,
the accumulation time of 70 s was chosen for analytical determination
experiments (vide infra).

3.2.4 Analytical Application
3.2.4.1 Calibration
Plot and Limit of Detection
For the determination of the
limits of detection of metanil yellow
and FCF at the designed sensor calix8/Au NPs/GCE, DPV was carried
out under optimized conditions of 70 s in 0.1 M PBS of pH 6. Figure 7A demonstrates concentration-dependent
enhancement in Faradic signals of target analytes. Linear calibration
curves in the concentration range of 0.05 to 45 μM were obtained
for metanil yellow and FCF, respectively (Figure 7B,C). The limit of detection was measured
using 3σ/m.48−51 The value of standard deviation
σ was calculated from the current values of the blank solutions
at the peak positions. The limit of detection was found to be 9.8
and 19.7 nM for metanil yellow and FCF, respectively. Table 1 gives a comparison of the performance
of the designed sensor with reported electroanalytical sensors used
for food toxin detection.52−56 The table reveals promising sensitivity of the designed sensor in
the context of either linearity range or LOD values.

3.2.4.2 Anti-Interference
and Reproducibility
An important characteristic of a sensor
is its ability to distinguish
between the target analyte and interfering species in the sample.57 In this work, some potential interfering biomolecules,
metal ions, and organic compounds were individually spiked in a 0.1
M PBS solution of pH 6.0 containing 40 μM metanil yellow and
FCF to examine the selectivity of the designed sensor. Figure S4A,B shows that the signals of metanil
yellow and FCF maintain their integrity even in the presence of 100-fold
higher concentration of K+, 120-fold higher concentration
of Sr2+, and 25-fold higher concentration each of Mg2+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Na+, Zn2+, and Cu2+ compared to the concentration of the
dyes. Additionally, Figure S4C,D shows
that the voltammetric signals of these dyes at calix8/Au NPs/GCE remain
almost unchanged, with a very small current variation of less than
3% in the presence of 120-fold higher concentration of NO3–, 25-fold higher concentration each of SO42–, Cl–, and CO32–, and 10-fold higher concentration of glycine,
alanine, sodium dodecyl sulfonate, and sucrose. These findings suggest
good selectivity of the designed sensor for the detection of metanil
yellow and FCF on the surface of modified GCE. Matching differential
pulse voltammograms of 40 μM metanil yellow and FCF at the modified
electrode prepared six times showed reproducibility of the designed
sensing platform.

3.3 Application
of Methodology
The applicability
of the designed sensor was examined for the sensing of metanil yellow
and FCF in water and juice samples. Water samples were used as such,
while 2 mL of juice samples was first diluted to 10.0 mL with 0.1
M PBS (pH 6.0). Then, recovery measurements were carried out by spiking
the known concentration of both dyes in water and juice samples, followed
by the measurement of recovered amount using calibration plots. Each
measurement was performed in triplicate. Recovery percentages can
be seen in Table 2.
The RSD values between 1.05 and 2.96% show good precision of the proposed
method. Moreover, recoveries in the range of 95 to 99% suggest applicability
of the designed sensor for real sample analysis.

4 Conclusions
A novel, robust, and efficient electrochemical
sensor made up of
GCE modified with calixarene and gold nanoparticles was prepared for
the simultaneous detection of two prohibited toxic food dyes: metanil
yellow and FCF. The components of the recognition layer significantly
improved the oxidation signals of the dyes on the modified electrode
surface as compared to unmodified GCE. EIS data offered evidence for
the influence of the modifier in enhancing charge transfer of the
redox probe through the electrode. Moreover, the role of the modifier
for facilitating electron transfer between the guest (dyes) and the
host (transducer) was ensured from the results of DPV. Conditions
such as pH of the medium, accumulation time, and supporting electrolytes
were optimized for getting intense current signals of the target food
toxins at calix8/Au NPs/GCE. The designed sensor was found to display
high sensing efficiency since it registered maximum current in less
than 2 min. The sensor also showed figures of merit in the context
of lower limits of detection for metanil yellow and FCF. Thus, the
designed sensor is a promising new tool as no report is available
until now for the simultaneous electrochemical sensing of both of
these dyes. The nanocomposite sensor also showed reproducibility,
wide linear range, and good selectivity for the selected food toxins.
The results revealed practical applicability of the designed sensor
for the determination of food toxins in real water and juice samples
with high recoveries.
