Imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazines are cyclic amidine-type
compounds composed of α-amino acid residues. A full structural
identification of these molecules constitutes an analytical challenge,
especially when imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazines are obtained
from physical processes (e.g., sublimation and pyrolysis of amino
acids). A valuable source of molecular information can be obtained
from absorption spectroscopies and related techniques encompassing
the use of metallic substrates. The aim of this study is to provide
new knowledge and insights into the noncovalent intermolecular interactions
between imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazines and two Agn (n = 4 and 20) clusters using density
functional theory (DFT) methods. Semiempirical DFT dispersion (DFT-D)
corrections were addressed using Grimme’s dispersion (GD2)
and Austin–Petersson–Frisch (APF) functionals in conjunction
with the 6-31+G(d,p) + LANL2DZ mixed
basis set. These DFT-D methods describe strong interactions; besides,
in all cases, the APF dispersion (APF-D) energies of interaction appear
to be consistently overestimated. In comparison with B3LYP calculations,
the mean values for the difference in the energies of interaction
calculated are 2.25 (GD2) and 6.24 (APF-D) kcal mol–1 for Ag4–molecules, and 2.30 (GD2) and 8.53 (APF-D)
kcal mol–1 for Ag20–molecules.
The effect of applying GD2 and APF-D corrections to the noncovalent
complexes is nuanced in the intermolecular distances calculated, mainly
in the Ag···N(amidine) bonding, which appears to play
the most important role for the adsorptive process. Selective enhancement
and considerable red shifts for Raman vibrations suggest strong interactions,
whereas a charge redistribution involving the metallic substrate and
the absorbate leads to a significant rearrangement of frontier molecular
orbitals mainly in the Ag20–molecule complexes.
Finally, time-dependent DFT calculations were carried out to access
the orbital contributions to each of the transitions observed in the
absorption spectrum. The corresponding UV–vis spectra involve
transitions in the visible region at around 400 and 550 nm for the
Ag4–molecule and the Ag20–molecule
complexes, respectively.

Introduction
Imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazines
are heterocyclic structures
composed of α-amino acid residues contained into a five-membered
imidazole fused to a six-membered pyrazine ring with a bridgehead
nitrogen atom. These unusual molecules are of great interest from
the point of view of amino acid–peptide chemistry because this
class of amidine-type compounds might manifest themselves as the central
compounds for the whole amidine chemistry.1 The natural occurrence of imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazines
was discovered in bioluminescence sea organisms2 involving luciferine3 and coelenterazine4,5 systems, which constitute the most representative natural imidazopyrazines
compounds. Their ability to luminesce under the action of oxidants
has allowed the development of chemiluminescent sensors based on the
determination of peroxides,6 glucose,7 and chemiluminescent immunoassay.8 A variety of biological activities (e.g., antibacterial,
anti-inflammatory, antiulcer, antibronchospastic, cardiac stimulating,
and inotropic properties) and cytotoxic effects on cancer cell lines
have been also reported for synthetic imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazines derivatives.9−16

Several methods from wet-chemistry16 to sublimation17 and pyrolysis18−21 of amino acids are used to prepare imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazines. However, one of the major difficulties to study these
molecules is lack of an adequate technique for a full structural identification. Combinatorial
techniques such as gas-phase Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry17−21 identified some derivatives, but such methods also
exhibited disadvantages because in situ decomposition of imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazines is very notable.18−21 The interest to study these cyclic
amidine-type molecules lies in the fact that derivatives of glycine
have failed to be detected by these techniques. The latter fact can
be directly associated with the selective detection, thermochemical
stability, or simply because cycle-condensation reactions of amino
acids are not able to produce enough amounts of imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazines. Previous quantum chemical calculations22 suggested that the formation of imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazines can proceed overcoming a high reaction barrier
of about 49 kcal mol–1 and only supported by a silica-catalyzed
process. This has opened up an area of great dubiety about the formation
and the spectroscopic properties23−25 of imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazines, which deserves more definitive answers and
novel approaches for experimental identification.

Vibrational
spectroscopy (e.g. Raman) can be the technique of choice
for such a molecular identification. In particular, surface-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy (SERS)26,27 dramatically can improve
the limit of detection using metallic substrates, resulting in detection
even at a single-molecule-level concentration.28 Under such a scenario, it is important to study the adsorptive
processes to attempt surface-enhanced Raman detection. Of particular
interest is the study of noncovalent intermolecular interactions with
metal clusters29 because no mechanism was
put forward to account for the adsorption of imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazines onto silver clusters. In the present study, the molecular
properties of the noncovalent complexes formed with imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazines and Agn (n = 4 and 20) clusters were studied using density functional
theory (DFT) methods. The chosen Ag clusters represent to simple models as much as the physical and
chemical properties of metallic substrates are of great relevance
in SERS.26−29 In particular, semiempirical dispersion corrections from Grimme
(GD2)30 and Austin–Petersson–Frisch
(APF-D)31 applied over the exchange–correlation
B3LYP32,33 functional can provide theoretical insights
into the strength of the noncovalent intermolecular interactions for
these complexes. In addition, DFT calculations were carried out to
predict static Raman activities, which further provide a measure of
the chemical enhancements that arise during the adsorption onto the
metallic substrates. Finally, time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations
were carried out to access the orbital contributions to each of the
transitions observed in the absorption spectrum, and molecular excitation
energies were obtained for both isolated molecule and metallic cluster-organic
compounds. Arising from sublimation of α-amino-acids (e.g.,
glycine), bi and tricyclic imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazines
prepared require the formation of a first intermediate.22 The current series of molecules studied correspond
to glycine (Gly, 1), piperazine-2,5-dione (DKP, 2), hexahydroimidazo[1,2-a]pyrazine-3,6-dione
(BCA, 3), and hexahydroimidazo[1,2-a]imidazo[1,2-d]pyrazine-3,8-dione (TCA, 4), which all are depicted in Scheme 1.

Results and Discussion
In this study, the noncovalent
intermolecular interactions occurring
on the metallic substrates were addressed using two sizes for the
silver clusters, namely, Agn (n = 4 and 20). Similarity and differences for these Ag clusters
were reported elsewhere.34−39 In particular, the Ag4 and Ag20 clusters were
chosen because they are the most stable structures in the potential
energy surface, respectively, for small-sized clusters (n < 10) and medium-sized clusters (12 < n <
22).34 Substantial differences with other
clusters is the relatively lower symmetry that can lead to metastable
isomers. Several DFT methods35 predicted
the global minimum for the neutral Ag4 and Ag20 clusters to be rhombic (D2h) and tetrahedral
(Td) structures, respectively. Ag20 (Td) is a relaxed fragment of
the face-centered cubic lattice of bulk silver, whereas Ag4 (D2h) is a subdomain located at the
vertex of Ag20 cluster. Because Ag4 (D2h) represents the local minima with respect to other
isomers (e.g. Td, C2v, see the Supporting Information), this structure was used as a structural criterion for a respective
comparison between both clusters. The energy gap between highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO),
and the Fermi energy level were calculated to characterize the metallic
substrates. The HOMO–LUMO gap energies, ΔGAP, (see Table 1), were
calculated to be about 1.8 and 2.5 eV, respectively, for the isolated
Ag4 and Ag20 clusters. It is well known that
the large energy gap corresponds to the higher stability for close-shell
electron configurations; therefore, Ag20 is more stable
than Ag4 (see Table 1). Empirical dispersion does not affect the properties of
the wavefunction31 and thus GD2 and APF-D
calculations result in similar values for HOMO–LUMO gap energies.
The Fermi level (EF, see the Supporting Information) was calculated to be
about −4.36 and −4.44 eV for Ag4 and Ag20, respectively. Such a difference can be related with a different
work function for transferring one quasi-electron from the Fermi level
to the vacuum state. For the large size cluster, the value calculated
is approximately similar for the bulk metal as obtained from photoelectric
measurements on the (111) surface of silver metal surfaces.40

Figure 1 shows the
geometries at the stationary points as obtained using DFT-D methods.
It was assumed that molecules (1–4) interacted
with an ad-atom site located at the vertex of the silver clusters.
Previous studies37 showed that this orientation
is more stable (∼2.3 kcal mol–1) that on-top
binding onto one of the four faces (111) of the Ag20 cluster.
From Figure 1, it becomes
evident that mainly two bonds stabilize the adsorptive processes,
in which the noncovalent interaction occurs along the Ag···N
(BCA and TCA) or Ag···O (DKP) bonds. As a result, one
can observe that molecules (1–4) can be adsorbed
mainly by cooperative interactions with the participation of NH2 and COOH groups. The unique exception is Ag20–Gly,
in which the interactions arise effectively from both amine and carboxyl
groups. For the Ag4–Gly complex, the calculated
bond distance between the N atom and the closest silver atom is 2.382
Å (DFT-D values), whereas this distance is slightly smaller (2.353
Å) for the Ag20–Gly complex. In this complex,
it is also observed that NH2 and COOH groups are coordinated
to the metal cluster, in which both O and N atoms lead to form a three-membered
ring. Such a bidentate interaction set up the bonding between the O atom and the
closest Ag atom (2.423 Å). On other hand, the cyclic derivative
DKP (2) forms complexes with Ag clusters via the Ag···O(amide)
bond because its N(amide) atom is covalently bounded to the H atom.
The resulting Ag···O separation is 2.298 Å for
the Ag4–DKP complex, whereas the intermolecular
distance is shortest (2.246 Å) for Ag20–DKP.
For BCA (3), the Ag···N separation is
longer (2.226 Å) in Ag4–BCA as compared to
Ag20–BCA (2.191 Å). Finally, for the Ag4–TCA complex the interaction occurred through the imidazole
ring, in which the Ag···N separation (2.314 Å)
is longer as comparted to the Ag20–TCA complex (2.191
Å). In the case of BCA and TCA, these molecules are adsorbed
with an edge-on orientation and the imidazo ring almost lying perpendicular
to the Ag clusters. The optimized structures suggested that the interaction
of BCA and TCA is governed mainly by the anchoring Ag···N(amine)
bonds. Mulliken population analysis indicates that N(amine) is rich
in electrons and can be able to donate electron density to the empty
4d and 5s orbitals of silver. The charges on Ag(vertex) and N(amide)
atoms calculated upon the formation of the complexes are Ag(−0.101)···N(−0.709),
Ag(−0.169)···N(−0.302), and Ag(−0.155)···N(−0.292)
for Ag20–Gly, Ag20–BCA and Ag20–TCA complexes, respectively. Therefore, Ag clusters
can behave as electron acceptors when charges arise from nitrogen
(e.g., Gly, BCA, and TCA). On the other hand, the Ag···O(amine)
bond gives rise to a weak interaction, mainly, in the Ag–DKP
complexes. The charges on the Ag20–DKP complex are
Ag(−0.346)···O(−0.380). The full list
of Mulliken population are in the Supporting Information. A reasonable explanation to this is that nitrogen is less electronegative
than oxygen, making it a better nucleophile. Finally, the optimized
Ag···N(amine) bond lengths are notably shorter in Ag20 clusters than the ones in the Ag4 cluster. The
intermolecular distances for Ag20–molecule complexes
are in the order of those calculated in the interaction of amino acids
(and short peptides) with small silver clusters.29

Figure 1 Optimized structures as obtained at the APFD-B3LYP/MBS level of
theory for the gas-phase formation of Gly, DKP, BCA, and TCA complexes
with Ag4 and Ag20 clusters. Selected interatomic
bond distances in angstroms are included for comparison between dispersive
(values in parenthesis) and nondispersive calculations.

Table 1 shows the
energies of interaction for the noncovalent complexes, ΔENC, calculated in terms of an adiabatic two-state
process using B3LYP, GD2 and APF-D functionals (absolute energies
are reported in the Supporting Information). In particular, both GD2 and APF-D values account for empirical
correction on dispersion through either electron pair bond formation,
charge transfer, or polarization mechanisms,30,31 whereas B3LYP values represent the level of interaction when dispersion
corrections are not taken into account. Therefore, GD2 and APF-D interaction
energies were benchmarked against B3LYP energies. The mean values
calculated for the Ag4–molecule complexes are 8.5,
12.5, and 14.7 kcal mol–1, respectively, for B3LYP,
GD2, and APF-D, whereas the mean value calculated for the Ag20–molecule complexes are 13.6, 19.8, and 22.1 kcal mol–1, respectively, for B3LYP, GD2, and APF-D. It is observed
that empirical dispersion correction using the APF-D functional resulted
in severe strong interactions because in all cases such energies appear
to be consistently overestimated in comparison with B3LYP calculations.
Differences for the energies of interaction calculated with respect
to B3LYP are 2.25 (GD2) and 6.24 (APF-D) kcal mol–1 for Ag4–molecules, and 2.30 (GD2) and 8.53 (APF-D)
kcal mol–1 for Ag20–molecules.
According to other studies, the dispersion term in the APF-D functional
should probably be re-evaluated,38 because
deviations can arise from some long-range dispersion that were double-counted
by the APF function and the spherical atom model. The HOMO–LUMO
gap energies (ΔGAP, see Table 1) are very similar for GD2 and APF-D calculations,
and slightly close with those values calculated without dispersion
(i.e., B3LYP). However, the HOMO–LUMO gap energies becomes
smaller after complexation with molecules, and this is noticeable
for those noncovalent complexes formed with the Ag4 cluster
(in about 0.34 eV). Figure 2 shows the iso-surfaces for HOMO and LUMO (at 0.02 a.u.) depicting
the frontier orbitals for the Ag–molecule complexes together
with a simplified orbital energy diagram. In the case of Ag4–molecule complexes (Figure 2A), a small extended distribution occurred in HOMO
orbitals, whereas in the Ag20–molecule complexes
(Figure 2B) a large
portion of HOMO is delocalized, suggesting the formation of electrostatic
field gradients around the Ag20 cluster that can induce
dipoles in the absorbates because of the changes in the surface charge
density. In particular, a significant rearrangement of the frontier
molecular orbitals occur in the Ag20–BCA and Ag20–TCA complexes. As regards spatial distribution of
frontier orbitals, the following situations can be observed:(1) HOMO is found exclusively on Ag metal
clusters.

(2) Both HOMO
and LUMO appear on the Ag4 metal cluster only.

(3) Traces of LUMO appear
on BCA and TCA.

(4) LUMO
is mainly localized in the imidazole
ring of BCA and TCA.

According to these situations, one can suggest
that imidazole rings
are responsible for binding imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazines
(i.e., BCA and TCA) to Ag clusters.

TDDFT calculations were
carried out on 15 electronic transitions
for the ground-state complexes. Table 2 shows the most important excitation energies (i.e.,
those with the largest oscillator strength) as calculated for vertical
excitation at using DFT-D methods. It is observed that the Ag4–molecules complexes exhibited the highest oscillator
strengths, whereas very small oscillator strengths were calculated
for the Ag20–molecules complexes. On one hand, the
excitations for electronic transitions in Ag4–molecule
systems are found at energies in the proximity of the absorption maxima
(i.e., 386 nm relative to the Ag4 cluster), that is, Ag4–Gly, 408 nm (f = 0.795); Ag4–DKP, 362 nm (f = 0.639); Ag4–BCA,
379 nm (f = 0.879); and Ag4–TCA,
393 nm (f = 0.601). Therefore, these metal-molecule
transitions should occur from orbitals below the HOMO (HOMO – N, with N = 1 and 2) of Ag4 to
the LUMO of each molecule. On the other hand, the calculated absorption
spectrum for Ag20–molecule complexes involves excitations
in the visible region and they are very close to the absorption maxima
(i.e., 537 nm, relative to the Ag20 cluster); that is,
Ag20–Gly, 554 nm (f = 0.021); Ag20–DKP, 543 nm (f = 0.025); Ag20–BCA, 547 nm (f = 0.024); and Ag20–TCA, 647 nm (f = 0.019). Figure 3 shows the simulated
absorptive spectrum of the studied complexes. The absorption showed
changes as a function of both the molecule and the cluster size. For
the Ag4–molecules complexes, the corresponding spectra
involve transitions in the visible region that might occur at about
400 nm, which are blue-shifted regarding the transitions for the Ag20–molecule complexes occurring at around 550 nm.

Theoretical Raman spectra for neutral Gly (1), DKP
(2), BCA (3,) and TCA (4) molecules
obtained using DFT-D methods are shown in Figure 4. Frequencies at the gas-phase with the corresponding
band assignments and the absolute Raman cross sections are respectively
listed in Tables 3–6. Raman spectra
were calculated only for neutral molecules, as it was demonstrated
that Raman spectra of amino acids do not depend on the pH values.41 In detail, Raman spectral profiles contain bands
grouped in two regions, namely, bands between 200 and 1000 cm–1 and bands within the range of 1000–2000 cm–1. However, peak intensities at the second range are
slightly smaller than the peaks located at the first range. Taking
into account the basis set effect on fundamental frequencies, the
wavenumber scaled was used for the full assignment on the vibrational
modes. In particular, the Raman spectra profile of Gly (1) shows bands associated with COO– bend + CH2 bend at 494 and 586 cm–1, stretching-type
modes of CH2 at 1190, 1398, and 1462 cm–1, and stretching of C=O at 1674 cm–1. In-plane
deformation bending δ(C=O) was at 807 cm–1, and δ(NH2) and wagging ρw(NH2) at 1092 and 1591 cm–1, respectively. A
number of additional bands because of CH2 and C=N
and C=O vibration modes are evident in the case of BCA (3) and TCA (4) molecules, whereas the spectra
of DKP (2) showed the presence of NH bands that remained
as the spectral characteristics
of Gly (1). The fingerprint region (i.e., 200 and 800
cm–1) for DKP, BCA, and TCA molecules is constituted
by peaks corresponding to the bands that all belong to deformation
modes involving ring distortions (i.e., deformations of pyrazine and
imidazo rings) as well as in-plane and out-of-plane bending of C=O
moieties. The strongest bands because of rings’ breathing of
DKP, BCA, and TCA molecules are located at 755, 707, and 702 cm–1, respectively.

0.959 factor.

Figure 5 shows the
effect of using Ag clusters on the Raman spectra of molecules (1–4). As observed, evident spectral differences resulted
in bands that appeared at different wavenumbers. In particular, selective
enhancement and considerable red shifts for several Raman vibrations
suggest that for some signal enhancements such a result effectively
corresponds to the presence of local interactions occurring between
the active site of the adsorbate (i.e., imidazole ring) and the effective
ad-atom of the metal surface. In particular, for the Ag4–Gly complex, the bands observed are δ(NH2), ρw(CH2), δ(NH2),
and ν(C=O) located at 862, 1277, 1598, and 1672 cm–1, respectively. Tenorio et al.41 calculated similar Raman spectra for glycine but using
a silver eight-atom cluster. For the Ag4–DKP complex,
the most characteristic absorption bands present intense peaks at
764, 1306, 1354, 1454, and 1641 cm–1 assigned to
ν(NH), δ(CH2), ν(NH), ν(N=C),
and ν(C=O) vibrations, respectively. For both Ag4–BCA and Ag4–TCA complexes, the most
intense bands were observed in a particular region between 1000 and
1500 cm–1. Absorption bands were predicted corresponding
to δ(CH2) at 996 cm–1, rings’
deformations at 1013 cm–1, ρw(CH2) at 1208 cm–1, pyrazine ring-deformation
at 1277 cm–1, bending δ(NH) at 1362 cm–1, imidazo ring-deformation at 1424 cm–1, bending δ(N=C) at 1613 cm–1, and
bending δ(C=O) at 1638 cm–1. Finally,
the Raman spectra of the molecules adsorbed onto the Ag20 cluster are much more similar than those of isolated molecules.
This is the case of the Ag20–Gly complex, in which
the most intense bands are δ(CCO), δ(NH2),
and δ(CH2), δ(CH2), ω(CH2), δ(NH2), and δ(C=O) located
at 629, 1147, 1386, 1435, and 1628 cm–1, respectively.
The predicted absorptions for the interval between δ(NH2) and δ(C=O) stretching is 193 cm–1, whereas in the case of Ag4–Gly, it was 74 cm–1. In Ag20–DKP, the principal absorption
bands correspond to ring breathing (764 and 889 cm–1), which is more evident than that in the Ag4 complex.
The bands δ(CH2), ν(NH), and ν(N=C)
were also observed at 1217, 1356, and 1429 cm–1,
respectively. However, C=O bands are much weaker and thus they
cannot be distinguished in the predicted spectrum. Because BCA and
TCA are molecules with the same chemical nature, the interaction energies
are similar, and form noncovalent complexes through the same active
site, the predicted Raman spectra for both Ag20–BCA
and Ag20–TCA complexes showed similar bands in the
800–1500 cm–1 region. According to the interaction
energies calculated (∼20 kcal mol–1), it
is expected that such values overpass a threshold required to observe
the SERS effect.41 However, further studies
should address other variables such as the effect of pH, charge of
Ag clusters and molecules, different metallic substrates, as well
as calculations of Raman activities using different laser wavelengths.

Figure 5 (A) Raman
spectra using the Ag4 cluster and (B) Raman
spectra using the Ag20 cluster. For the simulated static
normal Raman spectra of the Gly, DKP, BCA, and TCA complexes with
a metallic cluster the differential cross sections of molecules (in
units of 10–31 cm2/sr) were calculated
on the basis of static polarizability derivatives and using an incident
wavelength of 514.5 nm. The bands showed are given by a Lorentzian
width of 20 cm–1.

Conclusions
Theoretical calculations of the noncovalent
intermolecular interactions
between imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazines and silver clusters
were reported in the framework of dispersion-corrected DFT methods.
The main conclusions can be summarized as follows:In terms of a computational modeling that compensates
resource and time, the Ag20 cluster is a very useful model
to study the interactions of Ag nanoparticles with imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazines. In terms of an accurate prediction, dispersion-corrected
DFT methods are required to estimate interaction energies in the noncovalent
complexes studied.

The mean values for
the difference in the interaction
energies calculated appeared to be consistently overestimated with
APF-D, especially when complexes are formed with the Ag20 cluster.

Mulliken population analysis
suggests a transfer of
charge across the Ag···N(amine), red shifts for Raman
vibrations suggest strong interactions, and charge redistribution
involving HOMO and LUMO orbitals give rise to the formation of stable
noncovalent complexes that can surpass a dissociation limit.

These simulations constitute a useful and
valuable first
element for further experimental characterization of these unusual
classes of cyclic amidines.



Computational Methodology
To account for dispersive
interactions in the electron density
of the noncovalent molecule-metal cluster systems, all the electronic
structure calculations were studied through DFT using the Grimme30 and the APF31 dispersion
correction methods over the B3LYP functional. A mixed basis set (MBS)
was set using the 6-31G+(d,p) basis set for C, H, O, and N atoms plus
the LANL2DZ basis set for Ag. Details of relative interaction energies,
normal modes frequencies, Kohn–Sham HOMO and LUMO orbitals,
vertical excitation energies, Raman intensities calculations, basis-set
superposition error, and the details of the computational methodology
adopted for the present work are given in the Supporting Information.
