The 3D structures
of biomolecules determine their biological function.
Established methods in biomolecule structure determination typically
require purification, crystallization, or modification of target molecules,
which limits their applications for analyzing trace amounts of biomolecules
in complex matrices. Here, we developed instruments and methods of
mobility capillary electrophoresis (MCE) and its coupling with MS
for the 3D structural analysis of biomolecules in the liquid phase.
Biomolecules in complex matrices could be separated by MCE and sequentially
detected by MS. The effective radius and the aspect ratio of each
separated biomolecule were simultaneously determined through the separation
by MCE, which were then used as restraints in determining biomolecule
conformations through modeling. Feasibility of this method was verified
by analyzing a mixture of somatostatin and bradykinin, two peptides
with known liquid-phase structures. Proteins could also be structurally
analyzed using this method, which was demonstrated for lysozyme. The
combination of MCE and MS for complex sample analysis was also demonstrated.
MCE and MCE–MS would allow us to analyze trace amounts of biomolecules
in complex matrices, which has the potential to be an alternative
and powerful biomolecule structure analysis technique.

Introduction
The
activities and
functions of a biomolecule in physiological
and pathological processes closely correlate to its 3D structure.1−3 Therefore, biomolecule structure characterization is essential in
understanding biological processes and developing targeted drugs.
To date, many techniques have been developed and applied in resolving
biomolecule structures, including X-ray crystallography,4−6 NMR,7−10 cryo-electron microscopy,11−13 and SAXS.14,15 Although relatively high-resolution biomolecule structure information
could be obtained through these techniques, their applications in
analyzing trace amounts of biomolecules, especially under in situ
or in vivo conditions, are limited by the factor that target biomolecules
need to be purified to certain homogeneity and in certain amounts.5

With high sensitivity and specificity,
MS is capable of identifying
trace amounts of biomolecules in complex matrices.16−21 Not only the molecular weight information but also the primary sequence
could be resolved through high-resolution MS and tandem MS, respectively.22−24 As a result, MS has been widely applied in studying biological systems.
It is specifically attractive to use MS-based techniques for the structural
and functional investigation of the trace amount of biomolecules in
vivo. However, significant challenges exist when using conventional
MS for 3D structure studies of biomolecules. To solve this problem,
ion mobility spectrometry (IMS)25−30 and capillary electrophoresis (CE)31−38 have been increasingly coupled with MS to enhance its structure
analysis capability. As a gas-phase technique, analytes are vaporized
and ionized before their collision cross sections are measured in
IMS,39,40 thus raising debates whether structures
of biomolecules could be fully maintained.41 Ivory et al. introduced a series of method utilizing counterflows
to concentrate analyses in electrophoresis.42−45 Although CE is a solution-phase
technique that separates analytes based on their charge states and
sizes, the electroosmotic flow (EOF) in CE is sensitive to its operating
conditions, which affects its reproducibility and also its application
in biomolecule structural determination.46,47 Through chemical modifications of charged groups on a protein surface,
the protein ladder method could determine the effective charge and
size of a protein by capillary electrophoresis.48−51

Here, we developed a liquid-phase
biomolecule separation and 3D
structure analysis technique, named mobility capillary electrophoresis
(MCE). MCE is a new type of CE method in which a constant liquid flow
was used to replace EOF. Precise control of the liquid flow is beneficial
to ion structure analysis. MCE has the capability of not only separating
complex samples but also acquiring the sizes of biomolecules. Comparing
with the protein ladder method, MCE does not require chemical modifications
and has the capability of mixture analyses. The use of MCE in combination
with MD simulations as a structural determination method was demonstrated
here for peptide mixtures and a protein sample. A home-built MCE system
was successfully coupled with a mass spectrometer for complex sample
analysis. The MCE–MS system showed high stability, reproducibility,
and capabilities for biomolecule separation, identification, and structure
determination.

Theory and Results
MCE separates
the analytes based on their charge states, hydrodynamic
sizes, and geometries. With minimized EOF and well-controlled operating
parameters, MCE has high stability and reproducibility in the first
place. More importantly, the correlation between ion elution time
and ion effective size could be obtained and used to calculate the
effective radius of a biomolecule in solution. To better reconstruct
their 3D structures, biomolecules were assumed to have ellipsoid shapes.
With this ellipsoid approximation, a restrain curve was acquired for
a biomolecule, which defines its aspect ratio versus its radius. This
restrain curve was then used to evaluate or estimate the occurrence
probability of each conformation acquired from MD simulations. The
coupling of MD simulations with MCE experiments was first demonstrated
for angiotensin I in an MS friendly solvent, and its conformations
with top probabilities were picked out based on this scoring methodology.
This method was then applied for the analysis of a peptide mixture
in which somatostatin and bradykinin in a pH neutral solution were
separated and structurally analyzed. The predicted structures of bradykinin
and somatostatin obtained from this method were compared with those
obtained from NMR measurements. Finally, performances of the home-built
MCE–MS system were characterized through the analyses of biomolecule
mixtures and BSA using a typical bottom-up proteomic strategy.

Ion Motion
Modeling
In MCE experiments shown in Figure 1, a constant liquid
flow was used to provide a driving force in a liquid channel (fused
silica capillary in this case), and an electric field was also applied
to separate different ions in the liquid channel. When dissolved in
solutions, peptides, proteins, and other biomolecules are typically
ionized, if pH of the solution is different from their isoelectric
points. These ions will have directional motions when an electric
field is applied, which is known as electrophoresis. On the other
hand, ions will also experience a viscous drag force (Ff) when their motion speed is different from the liquid
flow. Besides the amount of charge an ion possesses, ion migration
time also depends on the size and geometry of the ion. In general,
ions with larger effective sizes will experience stronger viscous
drag force. Therefore, ion migration time (t) in
MCE could be used to calculate the ion effective radius (R).

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of the MCE setup (top). Illustrative MCE spectrum
(middle). Illustrative process of using MCE for ion shape estimation
(bottom).

To accurately calculate the ion
effective radius, ion migration
in MCE needs to be precisely controlled and characterized. Mathematical
models were first established to study this ion migration process.
The electric field force (Fe) acting on
an ion could be expressed as 1  in
which q is the amount of charge possessed by the
ion, E is the separation electric field intensity, U is
the dc potential applied across the separation capillary, and L is effective length of the separation capillary. Different
from neutral molecules, the velocity difference between ions and liquid
flow causes a viscous drag force. 2  where vr is the relative speed of an
ion, η is the viscosity
coefficient of the solution, and ξ = 6πηR. Under equilibrium, Fe would
be equal to Ff. The absolute migration
speed (vabsolute) could then be expressed
as 3  in which vcarrier is the flow rate of the liquid flow. EOF was minimized
in MCE so that liquid flow rate could be precisely controlled. To
minimize any residual EOF effects on the liquid flow rate, neutral
markers (phenol or DMSO) were used to accurately measure the velocity
of the liquid flow. Ion displacement (S) within the
separation capillary could be determined by 4  in which m is the mass of the ion.
After solving eq 4, ion
displacement with respect to time is 5  According to eq 5, the measured ion migration time
can be used to calculate the ion equivalent radius.

MCE Parameter
Optimization
Theoretical analysis of eq 5 shows that capillary length,
solvent viscosity, separation voltage, liquid driving pressure, and
liquid flow rate would all affect ion migration time. As shown in Figure 2, there is an inverse
relationship between ion effective radius and ion migration time.
A 50/40 cm long (total/effective length) fused silica capillary with
an i.d. of 75 μm was used in mobility capillary electrophoretic
theoretical calculation. A cation with a molecular weight of 1048
Da and +2 charge was selected as a model ion. As shown in Figure 2, there are three
segments in a characteristic curve: the front end, the turning point,
and the back end. In the front end, there would be a very small difference
in ion migration time even for ions with a large effective radius
difference. Meanwhile, the ion migration time would no longer reflect
the ion radius difference in the back end. Therefore, to improve measurement
accuracy, the analysis condition should be controlled so that the
range of ion migration time is located at the “turning point”
of the characteristic curve. As shown in Figure 2, a higher electric field would typically
shift the characteristic curve up, while a higher driving pressure
(or liquid flow rate) could shift the characteristic curve down. While
electric field and liquid flow rate are the two most important parameters,
capillary length, charge state of ions, and buffer viscosity also
have impacts on ion migration time. Details about these effects could
be found in the Supporting Information (Figure S2).

Figure 2 Characteristic curves of ion effective radius versus ion migration
time at different operation conditions.

To find the optimal running conditions, a series of experiments
were carried out. An MS friendly solvent (methanol/water buffer v/v
1:1) was first used as the buffer solution. Electrophoretic diagrams
of three peptides under different working conditions are given in Figure S3. It is found that the calculated equivalent
ion radius showed consistency under different working conditions (Figure S4), suggesting that this method is not
sensitive to running conditions. It should be noticed that decreasing
the liquid flow rate will increase the analysis time. Higher separation
voltage can lead to higher Joule heat, which will affect stability
of the system. Finally, −20 kV and 60 mbar were selected as
the optimized operating conditions in MCE experiments.

Ellipsoid Approximation
An ellipsoid approximation
was used to approximate the steric geometry of biomolecules,52 which was further simplified by spheroid approximation
(b = c). Under the current working
conditions, the liquid flow has a very low Reynolds number (∼0.075),
and the fluid direction is assumed to be parallel to the ellipsoid
axis of symmetry. A length-to-diameter ratio was defined as , and 6  

Since the ion effective
radius (R) could be obtained from MCE experiments
using eq 5, eq 6 sets a restrictive condition for
the 3D structure of a biomolecule.52Figure 3a–c shows
a typical process of using the MCE experiment to obtain the restrictive
condition. The peptide angiotensin I was used to demonstrate this
process. As plotted in Figure 3a, ion migration time (t) of angiotensin
I could be obtained by performing MCE analysis, while the neutral
marker peak in front was used to calibrate the liquid flow rate. Repeated
experiments (Figure 3a) show that MCE has great repeatability, and a CV (coefficient of
variance) value of 0.385% was achieved for angiotensin I. The peak
width and tailing effect of angiotensin I could be attributed to two
factors: (1) To achieve precise control of the liquid flow rate, laminar
flow was used in MCE, and the EOF was minimized. (2) To make sure
the MCE solvent is compatible with the MS solvent, a low-sodium or
no-sodium solvent was used in this study. With a low-sodium solvent,
conductivity of the running buffer is much lower than that of the
sample bands, which would cause a tailing effect in the peak due to
the electromigration dispersion effect.53,54 Another possible
reason for peak broadening may be due to the weak buffer capacity;
the peptides could cause local pH effects that affected the peak shape.
After solving eq 5, it
is found that angiotensin I has an equivalent radius of 9.7966 ±
0.0385 Å. By substituting the ion equivalent radius (R) in eq 6,
a one-to-one relationship could be obtained between the length-to-diameter
ratio (Φ) of angiotensin I and its semi-axis radius (c) as shown in Figure 3c, thus setting a structural restraint for angiotensin
I in the liquid solution (named the restrain curve).

and MD simulation for biomolecule structural
analysis. Angiotensin I was used as the example molecule. (a) MCE

Coupling MCE with MD Simulation
As an experimental
method, MCE provides a geometry restraint on biomolecules under analysis.
By coupling MCE with MD simulations, a scoring method was proposed
to predict the most likely conformations present in the solvent condition.
As shown in Figure 3d, possible structures of peptides and proteins could be obtained
using different types of MD simulation methods. The MCE measurement
results were used as a restraint on these simulation results and to
help pick out structures with higher probabilities. To do so, ellipsoid
approximation was also applied on simulated structures. The radii
of gyrations (Rg) of each conformation were first calculated (Figure 3e),55 and then the principal semi-axes of the ellipsoid (a, b, c) were extracted
based on the following equation (Figure 3f):56 7  After further approximating
biomolecules using the spheroid approximation, the effective diameter
(d) would be 8  As a result, the length, diameter,
and of course length-to-diameter ratio (Φ) could be obtained
for each simulated conformation.

As a demonstration, MD simulation
was carried out for angiotensin I in solution. A 100 ns MD simulation
under the MCE experimental conditions produced 10000 conformations,
which were then used as the conformation library, as shown in Figure 3d. The root-mean-square
deviations (RMSD) of angiotensin I were extracted and are shown in Figure S5. Following the data processing procedure
shown in Figure 3d,f,
the gyration radii of angiotensin I in x-, y-, and z-directions were calculated and
are plotted in Figure 3e. Ellipsoid approximation was then performed in which the principal
semi-axes of the ellipsoid (a, b, c) were calculated (Figure 3f).

MD simulation and MCE experimental
results were then matched by
plotting the length-to-diameter ratios of the 10000 simulated conformations
of angiotensin I into the corresponding restrain curve figure. Figure 3g shows the matching
result in which each simulated conformation was shown as a data point.
The score of each conformation is defined as the distance of the corresponding
data point from the restrain curve.

The smaller this score is,
the higher probability of the corresponding
biomolecule conformation is believed to exhibit in solution. The inset
in Figure 3g shows
the conformation of angiotensin I (in licorice representation) with
the minimum score (0.7623 Å). The top five conformations in terms
of closer distances from the restrain curve are also listed in Table 1. Results show that
the rod-like angiotensin I shows a random coil structure. Although
detailed structures of these five conformations have differences,
they have similar geometries. The small distances of simulated conformations
from the restrain curve suggest that this MCE-based method has reasonably
good agreement with MD simulations.

Mixture Analysis
Many high-resolution structural analysis
methods need high-purity samples or even crystal samples, which restricts
the application of these methods in high-throughput or complex sample
analyses. With the capability of ion separation, MCE could also be
applied in the structure analysis of biomolecules in mixtures. As
a proof-of-concept demonstration, the separation and structure analysis
of the somatostatin and bradykinin mixture were performed using MCE. Figure 4a plots a typical
electrophoretic diagram of the mixture in which the neutral marker
(DMSO), somatostatin, and bradykinin were separated in MCE under the
conditions of 25 kV and 60 mbar. Repeated MCE experiments were also
carried out (Figure S6), and CV values
of 1.740 and 0.824% were achieved for somatostatin and bradykinin,
respectively. Following the procedure in Figure 3a–c, the effective radii of somatostatin
and bradykinin were calculated as 9.9940 ± 0.1739 and 8.5183
± 0.0702 Å, respectively. After the ellipsoid approximation,
restrain curves of angiotensin I and bradykinin were obtained and
are shown in Figure 4b,c. To predict steric conformations of these two peptides, MD simulations
were then performed under neutral pH conditions as described in the Methods section. A 100 ns MD simulation produced
2000 conformations, which were then used as the conformation library.
Following the data processing procedure in Figure 3d–f, the gyration radii and principal
ellipsoid semi-axes of somatostatin and bradykinin in the x-, y-, and z-directions
were obtained (Figure S7). Figure 4b,c plots the matching results
between simulated conformations and restrain curves obtained from
MCE measurements. After applying the scoring method proposed earlier,
conformations of somatostatin and bradykinin with top probabilities
were obtained (Figure 4b,c). These two conformations have scores of 1.998 × 10–4 and 2.085 × 10–5 Å, respectively.
To validate the feasibility of this method, the top conformations
found using our method were also compared with those presented in
the NMR data bank. The figures in the right in Figure 4b,c are the comparison results in which new
cartoon representations are presented for clarification. Conformations
of somatostatin and bradykinin found using our scoring method (plotted
in yellow) agree well with those downloaded from the NMR data bank
(plotted in green and white).57,58 The RMSD for bradykinin
between the best simulation conformation and the NMR conformation
with aligned Cα atoms is 2.478 Å, while the corresponding
RMSD for somatostatin is 1.655 Å.

Structure analysis of a protein, lysozyme, was
also demonstrated
using this MCE method. Based on MCE elution time, the effective radius
of lysozyme was first calculated as 20.7020 ± 0.3223 Å.
The ellipsoid approximation restrain curve of lysozyme was obtained
and is shown in Figure 4d. To predict the steric conformations of this protein, MD simulations
were then carried out under pH ∼6 conditions as described in
the Methods section. A 10 ns MD simulation
produced 1000 conformations, which were then used as the conformation
library. The gyration radii and principal ellipsoid semi-axes of lysozyme
in the x-, y-, and z-directions were obtained (Figure S7). Figure 4d plots the matching
results between simulated conformations and restrain curves obtained
from MCE measurements. After applying the scoring method proposed
earlier, the conformation of lysozyme with top probability was obtained
(Figure 4d) with a
score of 0.2611 Å.

The top conformation acquired using
our method was also compared
with that presented in the NMR data bank, which is shown in the right
of Figure 4d. The conformation
found using our scoring method (plotted in yellow) agrees well with
that downloaded from the NMR data bank (plotted in green).59 The RMSD for lysozyme between the best simulation
conformation and the NMR conformation with aligned Cα atoms
is 1.333 Å.

MCE–MS for Mixture Analyses
The combination
of MCE and MS would be powerful in terms of complex sample analysis.
The home-built MCE–MS system as shown in Figure 5a was first optimized (details could be found
in the Supporting Information) and then
characterized using a mixture of six compounds, which includes an
amino acid: phenylalanine (3.7 mg/L); two peptides: angiotensin II
(10 mg/L) and bradykinin (16 mg/L); three proteins: insulin (80 mg/L),
lysozyme (160 mg/L), and cytochrome c (160 mg/L). Under the optimized
working conditions, these six compounds could be well separated in
two domains: the migration time domain and the m/z ratio domain. Figure 5b plots the three-dimensional MCE–MS spectrum,
and Figure 5c is the
corresponding two-dimensional heat map. As noted in Figure 5c, these six biomolecules show
up at different locations of the heat map due to their property differences.
In the m/z ratio domain, the sequence
of ions is determined by the m/z ratios of ions in the gas phase after nanoESI. In the migration
time domain, the sequence of ions is mainly determined by physical
sizes, charge, and folding states of ions in the liquid phase. Since
the drag force is proportional to the ion effective radius (R) and the electric field force is proportional to ion charge
(q), ion migration time would be proportional to q and inversely proportional to R. As shown
in Figure S1, larger ions with less charge
would show up earlier in the chromatogram, and the number of charge
would have bigger impacts on ion migration time than the ion effective
radius. Results in Figure 5 show that phenylalanine shows up before angiotensin II and
angiotensin II shows up before proteins, which might be due to the
fact that larger biomolecules would possess more charges in solution.
However, insulin has a very compact three-dimensional structure with
disulfide bonds and having less available charging sites, which might
result in a smaller q/R value than
bradykinin. As a result, insulin travels faster than bradykinin in
the MCE capillary. Figure 5d plots the total ion chromatogram (TIC) of MCE and the corresponding
mass spectra of these six compounds.

Figure 5 (a) Schematic diagram of the MCE–MS
apparatus. Separation
of a mixture using MCE–MS. (b) Three-dimensional MCE–MS
spectrum. (c) 2D heat map of panel (b). (d) TIC of the separation
process and the corresponding mass spectra.

The analysis of this six-compound mixture was also performed
on
a conventional CE instrument (Lumex Capel-105M capillary electrophoresis
system, Russia). In the capillary zone electrophoresis mode, five
peaks were observed for these six compounds in which insulin and bradykinin
were not separated. Furthermore, the elution sequence of these compounds
is also different from MCE (Figure S11),
which is cytochrome c, lysozyme, insulin/bradykinin, angiotensin II,
and phenylalanine. Results suggest that this MCE method has a different
separation mechanism and it is complementary not only to conventional
liquid chromatography (LC) but also complementary to conventional
CE. It should also be noticed that MCE separates analytes before ionization,
which is different from MCE. As a result, ions from the same analyte
would elute and show up simultaneously in MCE as shown in Figure 5, while ions from
the same analyte but at different charge states would spread across
a much broader range in MCE. For example, cytochrome c ions would
have the same charge state (at least very close to each other) in
solution before ionization, and they would have a similar migration
time in MCE. The different charge states observed in the mass spectra
are due to the ESI process, which would also unfold cytochrome c ions.
On the other hand, in a typical MCE experiment, cytochrome c would
be ionized first and then subject to the MCE separation. Hence, cytochrome
c ions at different charge states would be separated and have different
migration times in MCE.

Liquid-phase chromatography coupled
with MS has been widely used
in protein analysis.60 The use of MCE–MS
for BSA hydrolysate analysis and its comparison with conventional
LC–MS method were performed (Figure S12). A 51% peptide coverage rate was obtained using MCE–MS,
compared to the 55% peptide coverage rate using LC–MS. With
much shorter analysis time and similar peptide coverage rate, this
MCE–MS method could benefit high-throughput omics studies.
The use of MCE for isomer analysis was also shown and is plotted in Figure S13. With complementary separation mechanisms,
MCE could also be used together with LC or CE techniques so that multidimensional
chromatography methods could be achieved. Since the current MCE separation
still takes about 10–20 mins, offline coupling methods could
be possible.

Conclusions
In this study, MCE was
introduced and characterized as a liquid-phase
biomolecule 3D structure analysis technique and an MS compatible chromatography
method. By assuming biomolecules have ellipsoid shapes, the approximate
shape information of biomolecules could be promptly obtained using
MCE and used as a restraint for biomolecule structure determination.
Separation and structure analysis of a peptide mixture were demonstrated,
suggesting that MCE could be used as a fast and convenient method
for structure analysis of biomolecules in complex matrices. Charge
states of peptides and proteins were calculated from theoretical and
empirical equations, which are derived based on the proton affinities
of amino acids. Therefore, the current method is limited to peptide
and protein analyses under low ionic strength working conditions.
In the future, techniques such as Taylor dispersion61 and ion current measurement could be included so that biomolecule
charge state and shape could be obtained simultaneously. The peak
width/shape in MCE experiments could also be improved in the future,
by using thinner capillaries and more conductive solvents. The coupling
of MCE with MS could further extend its application for large-scale
in vitro and in vivo biomolecule structural and function investigations.

Methods
Chemicals
and Materials
Peptides angiotensin I, angiotensin
II, bradykinin, and somatostatin were synthesized by SBS Genetech
Co. LTD. (Beijing, China). DMSO, sodium chloride, phenol, formic acid
(FA), dl-dithiothreitol (DTT), ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3), iodoacetamide (IAA), phenylalanine (Phe),
lysozyme, cytochrome c, insulin, and BSA were purchased from Sigma
Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). 2-Methyl-5-nitroaniline and 3,5-diaminobenzoic
acid were purchased from J&K Chemical Ltd. (Beijing, China). HPLC
grade acetonitrile and methanol were obtained from Fisher Chem. Alert
Co. (NJ, USA). Proteomics grade purity trypsin was purchased from
Promega (Madison, USA). All these reagents were used without any further
purification. Deionized water was purchased from Wahaha Co. (Hangzhou,
China). Peptide and protein sample solutions were prepared in water
as stock solutions at a concentration of 5 mg/mL and diluted to final
concentrations in the corresponding running buffer in each experiment.

Sample Preparation and MCE Conditions for Peptide and Protein
Structure Analyses
MCE experiments were first performed on
a Lumex CE system (model Capel-105M, St. Petersburg, Russia) equipped
with a UV detector. Fused silica capillaries (uncoated and coated)
with an i.d. of 75 and an o.d. of 360 μm were purchased from
Sino Sumtech (Hebei, China). Any new fused silica capillary was cleaned
by rinsing it with methanol/water running buffer for 30 min before
use. In this MCE system, no EOF is needed, so activation of the capillary
was not required and not performed before use. EOF in the capillary
was minimized by either using unactivated capillary at low pH conditions
(pH ∼3) or using coated capillary. Low-salt or no-salt solvent
systems were used to further help lowering the EOF and to make the
MCE compatible with MS. Of course, other methods, such as coating
and applying external fields, could also be applied to minimize the
EOF.47,62,63 Between runs,
the capillary was rinsed with running buffer for 3 min. When analyzing
angiotensin I, an MS compatible solvent, methanol/water (v/v 1:1 with
0.1% FA, η = 1.62 mPa·S) was used as the running buffer.
Angiotensin I was diluted to 1 mg/mL, and 1‰ phenol (1 mol/L)
was also added in the sample solution. Phenol was selected and used
as a neutral marker in acidic conditions to calibrate the velocity
of the liquid flow.63 In the following
experiments, neutral coated capillaries were used under neutral pH
conditions. When analyzing the mixture of somatostatin and bradykinin,
a pH neutral solution containing 2 mM NaCl in water (pH = ∼7,
η = ∼0.89 mPa·S) was applied as the running buffer.
Somatostatin and bradykinin were diluted to 1 mg/mL, and 1‰
DMSO was added as the neutral marker. Lysozyme was analyzed using
water as the running buffer (η = ∼0.89 mPa·S), and
its pH was adjusted to 6 by FA. Lysozyme was diluted to 2 mg/mL, and
5‰ phenol (1 mol/L) was added as the neutral marker in acidic
conditions.

Working conditions of the Lumex system were modified
as follows to perform MCE experiments (otherwise specified): samples
were injected by applying a 50 mbar pressure for 5 s; a −20
kV running voltage was applied over a 50 cm long fused silica capillary,
which has an effective length of 40 cm (distance from the sample injection
point to the UV detector); a 60 mbar pressure was applied to drive
the liquid flow; an environment temperature of 25 °C was maintained
for the capillary; detection wavelength of the UV detector was 214
nm. Working conditions of −15 kV voltage and 90 mbar pressure
were applied during the lysozyme analysis.

Home-built MCE–MS
Instrument Setup
Figure S1 (as
well as in Figure 5a) shows a schematic illustration of the
home-built MCE–MS system, in which the MCE system was coupled
with the MS system through a nanoESI source. The MCE system mainly
consists of four parts: a sample injection part, a running buffer
pumping system, a separation capillary, and a DC separation voltage
module. To operate the MCE system, samples were first injected into
the fluid channel using a syringe (Hamilton) driven by a syringe pump
(KD Scientific Syringe Pump Company), and a microvalve (Agilent 1200
Series 2 Position/ 6 Port, VICI, No. G1162A) was used to accurately
control the sample injection amount.64 During
the sample injection period, the microvalve was switched to the quantitative
loop, and samples were injected from the syringe to the quantitative
loop with a pumping speed of 20 μL/h for 0.1 min.

After
sample injection, the microvalve was switched to the quantitative
loop, and another syringe pump was connected and used to pump the
running buffer (methanol/water v/v 1:1 with 0.1% FA) into the flow
channel for sample separation. The same fused silica capillary (unactivated)
with a length of 40 cm was used as the separation channel. During
MCE–MS experiments, the injected sample was flushed into the
separation channel by the running buffer at a constant flow rate.
At the same time, a constant dc separation voltage was applied across
the separation capillary as shown in Figure S1. A negative high voltage was applied at the back end of the capillary
(close to the sample injection side), and the front end of the capillary
was grounded (close to the nanoESI side). After separation within
the capillary, analytes would be ionized by the nanoESI source (FS360-50-15-D,
New Objective, Woburn, MA), and MS analyzed by the consequent Q-TOF
mass spectrometer (Agilent G6520B Accurate-Mass Q-TOF). A negative
high voltage from 1300 to 1600 V was applied on the MS inlet, which
provides ionization voltage for the nanoESI source. The following
MS parameters were used in experiments: gas temperature 300 °C,
gas flow rate 8.0 L/min, fragmentor: 200, full MS parameters: resolution
= 20000, max ion injection time = 100 ms, MS scan range = 100–2000
Th; MS/MS parameters: resolution = 20000, max ion injection time =
100 ms, and MS scan range = 100–2000 Th.

Tryptic Digestion
of BSA
One microgram of BSA was denatured
and reduced by a 200 μL solution containing 8 M urea and 10
mM DTT in 50 mM NH4HCO3 buffer (pH 8.3) at 37
°C for 2 h. Alkylation was performed in a 50 mM IAA solution
at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. After alkylation, the sample
was diluted using a 50 mM NH4HCO3 buffer to
give a final urea concentration of 1 M. Tryptic digestion was then
performed at a protein-to-trypsin concentration ratio of 50:1 (w/w)
for 16 h at 37 °C.65 After digestion,
residual trypsin activity was quenched by adding 3% FA (v/v) and boiling
the sample for 10 min. Next, the digested peptide samples were desalted
by reversed-phase C18 SPE column and then lyophilized to complete
dryness. Dry powder was dissolved in running buffer and centrifuged
at 17000g for 5 min before MCE–MS analysis.

MD Simulation
MD simulations were conducted with the
AMBER99SB-ildn force field66 in GROMACS
2016.1.67 The AmberTools 16 was used to
create peptides that were not supported in the data bank.68 Charge states of peptides in the experiments
were calculated based on the literature (refer to the Supporting Information for details).69,70 It is found that angiotensin I has a charge state of +3 at a pH
of 3. For angiotensin I, MD simulation was performed on a methanol/water
solvent box (1:1 volume ratio), which has a dimension of ∼65
Å. The formic anion was the counterion. Under the native experimental
conditions (pH = 7 in water solution), both somatostatin and bradykinin
show the +2 charge state. The chloride anion was the counterion. In
this case, MD simulations were performed on a sodium chloride water
solvent box, which has a dimension of ∼52.5 Å. In all
simulations, energy minimization was performed and followed by 1 ns
equilibration at 300 K. The overall simulation window was 100 ns.
Lysozyme MD simulation was conducted with the GROMOS96 54a7 force
field. Charge states of lysozyme in the experiments were calculated
by propka-3.1.71,72 It is found that lysozyme has
a charge state of +9 at a pH of 6. The starting system consisted of
a cubic simulation box of X = Y = Z = ∼76.9 Å, containing one lysozyme molecule
and 14405 water molecules. The formic anion was the counterion. The
overall simulation window was 10 ns.
