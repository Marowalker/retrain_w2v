Small π-conjugated molecules
can be designed and synthesized
to undergo controlled self-assembly forming low-dimensional architectures,
with programmed order at the supramolecular level. Such order is of
paramount importance because it defines the property of the obtained
material. Here, we have focused our attention to four pyromellitic
diimide derivatives exposing different types of side chains. The joint
effect of different noncovalent interactions including π–π
stacking, H-bonding, and van der Waals forces on the four derivatives
yielded different self-assembled architectures. Atomic force microscopy
studies, corroborated with infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopic measurements, provided complementary multiscale insight
into these assemblies.

Introduction
Molecular self-assembly
at surfaces through the subtle control
of the interplay between intramolecular, intermolecular, and interfacial
interactions is a viable strategy to create highly ordered, supramolecularly
engineered (multi)functional materials1,2 as key components
for the bottom-up fabrication of molecular-scale devices.3−9

π-Conjugated (small) molecules are capable of undergoing
spontaneous self-assembly to form low-dimensional structures, which
can efficiently transport charges and excitons.10−18 Such systems have been investigated for their unique optical properties
as dyes19−22 and for their tendency to self-assemble into macroscopic supramolecular
electroactive aggregates.23 By modifying
the experimental conditions and functionalization of the aromatic
core, one can produce various types of aggregates such as nanowires,24 nanoribbons,25 and
nanotubes.26,27 These structures can be extremely
useful and can be of interest for different technological applications
in the field of organic photonics and electronics,28,29 photovoltaics,30,31 and sensing.32 Among π-conjugated systems, rylene diimides are probably
the most studied class of compounds, thanks to their versatility and
ease of functionalization in different positions with a wide variety
of substituents.20,33−35

In particular,
pyromellitic diimide derivatives decorated with
fluorinated side chains have been used as active layers in n-channel
organic thin-film transistors, which show field-effect mobilities
up to 0.079 cm2 V–1 s–1 and Ion/Ioff ratios of 106.36,37 These high performances
result from the close π–π stacking between the
side benzene rings and pyromellitic diimide cores.37 The mobility was almost one order of magnitude lower than
that of the naphthalene diimide analogue,35 primarily because of the smaller size of the aromatic core. The
side N,N′-substituents were found to strongly influence the
electrical characteristics of this material. This aspect, together
with the relatively easy synthesis of pyromellitic diimide compared
to that of other rylene derivatives, represents an advantage in terms
of large-scale production, making these molecules interesting systems
to be explored.

Recently, we have investigated the self-assembly
of a pyromellitic
diimide derivative, namely 5,5′-(1,3,5,7-tetraoxopyrrolo[3,4-f]isoindole-2,6-diyl)diisophthalic acid (1),
forming a supramolecular two-dimensional (2D) network on highly oriented
pyrolitic graphite (HOPG) substrates.38 In that case, we found that H-bonding among adjacent carboxylic
acid moieties was driving the self-assembly toward the formation of
planar supramolecular architectures. The planar conformation of the
molecule is in fact determined by the intramolecular C=O···H-C-H-bonds
between the diimide core and the rylene substituents.

Although
the H-bonding represents one of the most investigated
noncovalent patterns,39,40 in the present work we replace
the carboxylic acids with other moieties to exploit other types of
noncovalent interactions for modulating the self-assembly of pyromellitic
diimide. In particular, we expand the capacity of these molecules
to undergo self-assembly forming three-dimensional microscopic aggregates.
Alongside the pyromellitic diimide functionalized with tetracarboxylic
acid (1), we have focused our attention to two ester
derivatives having OCH3 (2) and OC6H13 (3) alkoxy groups and an NHC6H13 amide (4) moiety (Figure 1) (see Supporting Information (SI) for description of the synthesis).

Figure 1 Molecular structure of
the four pyromellitic diimides.

We have studied their molecular aggregation behavior by employing
the solvent-induced precipitation (SIP) approach,41,42 followed by a slow post-treatment process, that is, solvent vapor
annealing (SVA),43,44 which was expected to promote
rearrangement of the obtained architectures on the solid substrate.
The self-assembly behavior was also explored by means of atomic force
microscopy (AFM) corroborated by 1H NMR and temperature-resolved
IR studies.

Results and Discussion
A drop of 0.1 mM solution of
compounds 1–4 was applied to the
basal plane of SiO2 substrates.
Because of their low solubility, compounds 1 and 2 were dissolved in warm dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), whereas 3 and 4 were solubilized in chloroform. To promote
molecular aggregation, SIP was exploited by adding aliquots of 1:50
v/v ratio of solutions in a nonsolvent. The chosen nonsolvent was
chloroform for compounds 1 and 2 and methanol
for compounds 3 and 4. The obtained dispersions
(50 μL) were drop-casted onto SiO2 substrates and
dried in air.

The morphology of the films obtained by fast aggregation
process
induced by the addition of a nonsolvent during SIP was imaged by AFM
operating in intermittent contact-mode (Figure 2a–d). In such an SIP process, the
molecule–molecule interactions are maximized and the substrate
has mainly the role of guiding the positioning of structures already
preformed.

Figure 2 Topographical AFM images of the self-assembled architectures produced
by SIP (top) and their successive modification resulted from the SVA
post-treatment (bottom) of compounds 1 (a, e), 2 (b, f), 3 (c, g), and 4 (d, h). Z-scales: (a) 3 μm (inset: 4 nm), (b) 600 nm, (c)
3 μm, (d) 1000 nm, (e) 80 nm (inset: 7 nm) (f) 900 nm, (g) 80
nm, and (h) 3 nm.

Figure 2a reveals
that compound 1 forms μm-thick aggregates on SiO2 as a result of the poor wettability of the dropped dispersion,
which tends to cluster in very small regions on SiO2. Nevertheless,
by investigating the apparently uncovered areas, very small and flat
regions of a molecular adsorbate are observed. These domains are homogeneously
spread on the surface of SiO2: they consist of grains exhibiting
an average thickness of 1 nm and diameters of about 150 nm (see the
inset in Figure 2a
and the particle distribution in Figure S10), which is consistent with a self-assembly scenario in which molecules
are arranged in an edge-on fashion.

Interestingly, when the
pyromellitic diimides are decorated with
different side chains, they exhibit markedly different SIP-induced
assembly behaviors. Bundles of crystal-like needles were, in fact,
observed in the two ester derivatives, that is, 2 and 3, whereas compound 4 was found to form more
flexible fiberlike structures. The size of the fibers was also estimated
from the AFM images. Compound 2 formed fibers of 5–10
μm in length, with the thinnest fibers having a diameter of
1.2–1.5 nm. The structures formed from compound 3 were several tens of micrometers in length and hundreds-of-nanometer
wide. Finally, the fibers of compound 4 were a few micrometers
long and tens of nanometer wide (see more details in Figure S14).

In the employed SIP deposition process,
the aggregates previously
formed in solution are transferred onto the substrate surface. This
phenomenon was indeed confirmed by depositing the solution of 1 on mica, showing sheetlike structures (observed also in
SiO2) yet in this case oriented along preferential directions,
reflecting the 3-fold symmetry of the crystalline substrate (see Figure S10).

In the second stage, all of
the samples of Figure 2a–d were kept in a sealed environment
saturated with the vapors of CHCl3 to promote structural
rearrangement onto the surface; the results of this post-processing
are shown in Figure 2e–h. The acid derivative 1-based, micrometer-thick
aggregates re-arrange into layered architectures, even though the
thicker, small sheetlike structures are still present.

By carefully
measuring the thickness of the layers from profiles
in AFM topographical images, it was noticed that they are multiples
of 1.3 nm, which corresponds to a configuration where the molecules
are standing in an edge-on configuration on the substrate (see Figure S11).

Although the SIP-produced
aggregates of compound 2 seem not to be affected by the
SVA post-treatment (Figure 2b vs Figure 2f), the morphologies of the films of 3 and 4 appear to change dramatically after exposure
to the solvent vapors. In particular, the rigid crystal-like needles
of 3 observed in Figure 2c reorganize at surfaces forming an intricate layer
of flexible fibrillar structures (Figure 2g). Conversely, the already flexible hundreds-of-nanometer
tall structures of 4 shown in Figure 2d seem to establish a stronger interaction
with the substrate, by forming a layer around 1 nm thick, which is
noticeably composed by very long fibrillar structures assembled in
a uniform fashion (Figure 2h). By analyzing the thickness of these fibrils, it is possible
to deduce that the layer is a monomolecular one, where the fibrils
are composed of molecules stacked, with their long axis likely parallel
to the substrate. Such an assembly can be described by the formation
C=O···H–N bonds formed between the amide
moieties and π–π interactions between the aromatic
cores. The labile nature of the molecular assemblies of 3 and 4 can be attributed to the formation of thermodynamically
favored structures upon exposure to chloroform vapors, during which
the assemblies formed through the SIP process are rearranged to maximize
both molecule–molecule and molecule–substrate interactions.

The self-assembly behavior of these molecules in solution has been
studied by NMR (see Figures S2–S9). Although the NMR spectra of derivatives 2 and 3 showed no evidence of intermolecular interactions, derivatives 1 and 4 were found to create intermolecular H-bonds.
On one hand, NMR studies of 1 have been already reported.38 On the other hand, NMR spectra of 4 in DMSO-d6, being an exceptionally strong
H-bond acceptor, display signals expected for compound 4 (Figures S6 and S7). In such a solvent,
any intermolecular (and intramolecular) H-bonds are completely disrupted,
leading to solvated monomers, in which any conformational interconversion
is sufficiently fast to lead to the expected C2 symmetry on the NMR chemical shift timescale. Conversely,
the 1H NMR spectrum of compound 4 in CDCl3 (Figure S8), being a solvent that
does not disrupt intermolecular (or intramolecular) H-bonding, is
significantly different and entirely consistent with the formation
of a H-bonded structure. The latter is evidenced by the broadening
of the NMR resonance lines (see signals NH and CH at 6.38 and 8.48
ppm, respectively) in stark contrast to the spectrum obtained in DMSO-d6. Variable temperature 1H NMR spectra
of compound 4 in the 233–323 K temperature range
in CDCl3 were recorded to gain insight into the self-assembly
of 4 in solution (Figure S9). Upon heating the sample up to 323 K, a significant sharpening
and shifting of the two resonance lines engaged in the formation of
the supramolecular assembly is monitored. Such observations can be
ascribed to the progressive degradation of the H-bonding interactions.
By lowering the temperature of the sample, a significant broadening
of proton signals was monitored up to 273 K, which can be associated
with increased participation to hydrogen bonds between the molecules
and/or formation of stacking assemblies. Interestingly, below 253
K, the spectra become very complex, showing multiple splitting of
the resonance lines, which is probably a sign of the formation of
higher order aggregates. Structural behavior of different compounds
is well known to be dependent on solvation energies and intermolecular
interactions, thus giving rise to question whether the molecular assemblies
present in the solid state accurately reflect those existing in solution.
Herein, we propose that the fibrillar architectures observed in the
solid state by AFM might not necessarily be the dominant species in
solution, especially at lowered temperatures. Bearing in mind that
the strength of the intermolecular interactions, that is, (i) H-bonding,
(ii) π–π stacking, and (iii) alkyl-chain interdigitation
generally can be described as (i) ≫ (ii) ≅ (iii), we
speculate that a decrease in temperature facilitates face-to-face
aggregation of aromatic diimide cores, some of which might interact
with each other via intermolecular H-bonding in such a way that finally
even alkyl chains become ordered to a certain extent.

To probe
interactions in the solid state between individual pyromellitic
diimide derivatives 1–4, IR spectra
were recorded for their powder and thin film forms (see Experimental Procedures) at variable temperatures, thus focusing
our attention on the groups which can noncovalently interact, that
is, the C=O, C–H, and O–H moieties. The stretching
modes of these groups yield strong IR bands that are well separated
from other vibrational bands; therefore, they are especially suitable
for our considerations.

Compound 1 was not found
to melt. Above ca. 230 °C,
the samples gradually and irreversibly changed their color, providing
evidence for the occurrence of decomposition. In particular, we have
visualized a broad spectral feature in the wavenumber range 2100–3700
cm–1 which can be ascribed to stretching modes of
hydrogen bonded O–H groups and consists of at least three components
centered at about 3560, 2980, and 3480 cm–1 (Figure 3a). Because 1 has four carboxylic groups related to each other by C2 symmetry, it is possible that the molecules
in the crystal are interacting via O–H···O bridges
(Figure 3b) to form
2D arrays, similarly to those previously observed on the HOPG substrate.38 The absence of any vibrational feature at ca.
3650 cm–1 indicates that all carboxylic groups are
involved in H-bonds. Interactions between individual 2D layers are
also possible, thus leading to the generation of larger aggregates,
likely via π–π stacking. With the increasing temperature,
the intensity of the broad 2100–3700 cm–1 feature considerable decreases but without any significant change
of the band shape. The only visible modification is noticed for the
component at ca. 3480 cm–1. This relatively broad
component at 25 °C disappears upon heating at about 50 °C;
however, at higher temperatures a much narrower band at the same position
is observed. We propose that at room temperature two kinds of the
O–H···O bond (intramolecular and intermolecular)
exist that are responsible for formation of two kinds of intralayer
hydrogen bonding motifs shown schematically in Figure S15 as MODE A and MODE B. MODE A is ascribed to the
form of the previously observed H-bonding pattern,38 where each COOH group of 1 interacts with
four neighboring molecules through the formation of four complementary
di-hapto H-bonds. MODE B has been attributed to the pattern in which
each carboxylic group contributes to the formation of a single H-bond
with diimide carbonyl group, which are not involved in the pattern
in MODE A, and one intermolecular C=O···H interaction.
Upon heating to about 50 °C, molecule 1 was found
to undergo rearrangement from MODE B to MODE A, and the O–H
band at 3480 cm–1 related to the intramolecular
H-bond nearly disappeared. In the region of C=O stretching
vibrations, we find a band at about 1775 cm–1 that
can be assigned to the free C=O (not involved in H-bonds) belonging
to the imide groups of 1. On the other hand, a broad
band centered at about 1720 cm–1, which consists
of several components, is attributed to the C=O groups (both
imide and carboxylic) which form H-bonds. With the increasing temperature,
it is possible to observe a continuous decrease in intensity of the
C=O feature at 1720 cm–1, similar to the
observation for the O–H bands. At the same time, the intensity
of the band at 1775 cm–1 grows up to about 50 °C
and above this temperature it decreases (Figure 3c); the temperature behavior of this band
is different in comparison with other vibrational features of 1, for example, the band at 1104 cm–1 (Figure 3c). By and large,
within the proposed interpretation, the temperature behavior of both
O–H and C=O bands suggests that heating-induced transition
from MODE B to MODE A takes place and is followed by continuous decomposition
of the latter mode upon further heating.

(b) schematic representation of −COOH dimer; (c) integral intensity
of the bands at 1775 cm–1 (filled circles) and 1104
cm–1 (triangles).

Compound 2 melts above ca. 360 °C; the
relatively
high melting temperature can be determined by the occurrence of π–π
stacking between the aromatic rings of molecules and the absence of
both long alkyl chains and H-bonding. Temperature dependence of the
IR spectra of the sample heated up to melting is shown in Figure S16a. The band intensities gradually decrease
with the temperature but without any important modifications, which
could indicate a phase transition. After sample melting a thin film
was formed. The IR spectra of such a thin film upon cooling down to
25 °C and then heating up to 370 °C were practically the
same (Figure S16b). Before crystal heating
at 25 °C in the region of C–H stretching, we find three
bands at 2964, 3027, and 3090 cm–1, which are due
to the methyl groups and aromatic moieties. The bands at 3490 and
3587 cm–1 can be assigned to overtones of the C=O
stretching mode; it is also possible that they are due to water molecules
present in the crystal of 2. At 1730 cm–1, strong vibrational feature can be seen and can be attributed to
the C=O stretching vibrations from ester groups, and at 1775
cm–1, a weaker and narrower band attributed to C=O
stretching of free imide moieties groups can be seen. The band at
1775 cm–1 gets slightly stronger in film.

Melting of compound 3 was observed at about 160 °C.
In the spectra recorded at room temperature, the bands at 2861, 2926,
2950, and 3082 cm–1 can be attributed to the C–H
stretching modes of alkyl and aromatic rings, whereas the bands at
3254 and 3485 cm–1 are most probably overtones of
the C=O mode and/or water molecules (see Figure S17a). Within the region of C=O stretching,
we observe two bands at 1710 and 1732 cm–1, which
by analogy with 1 and 2 could be assigned
to associated C=O groups; it is remarkable that this spectrum
does not exhibit a well-defined spectral feature, which could be attributed
to the free C=O groups. We propose those to be a result of
the disordered nature of individual molecules with regard to self-assembly
in the solid state, allowing for CH···O=C contacts
responsible for the observed wavenumber values. After melting and
recrystallization, the IR spectra undergo considerable changes, which
give evidence of formation of a new phase. In this case, we observe
both the free C=O bonds of imide groups and the C=O
bonds of end groups, which can be at least partially associated, yielding
bands at 1720 and 1772 cm–1, respectively (Figure S17b). In the new phase also, the C–H
stretching bands are more narrow and easy to be recognized. By and
large, after recrystallization, the sample gets more ordered; nevertheless,
in this phase, the C=O bonds are not involved in H-bond contacts.
We tentatively propose that upon the occurrence of heating and cooling
cycles molecule 3 self-assembles into structures exhibiting
a higher degree of order, which involves both interdigitation of alkyl
chains and π–π stacking interactions, the latter
occurs in the steplike manner (Figure S18). Such phenomena would be in accordance with AFM studies and could
explain that molecule–substrate interactions are weaker than
mutual molecule–molecule interactions. Because the only difference
within the framework of compounds 2 and 3 involves the length of the alkyl chain (methyl for 2 and n-hexyl for 3), additional conclusions
can be drawn. Apart from a significant increase in the melting temperature
of 2, it seems that the main consequence of tuning the
length of the ester chain is an increase of the degree of conformational
freedom, as observed during heating/melting/cooling cycle of 3. Importantly, similar behavior was not observed for 2, because hardly any changes were noticed upon applying the
same experimental protocol.

Compound 4 melts at
ca. 250 °C. At 25 °C,
the IR spectrum of 4 reveals a group of strong bands
centered at 2920 cm–1 (superposition of three components
at 2866, 2920, 2959 cm–1), which can be attributed
to the C–H stretching modes of alkyl −(CH2)5CH3 groups (Figure 4a). The band at 3073 cm–1 is assigned to the C–H stretching of aromatic rings. The
considerable bandwidth of the C–H bands provides evidence of
a disorder of the alkyl groups. The band centered at 3231 cm–1 is due to N–H groups, which form H-bonds. Surprisingly, the
C=O modes of both the free and associated groups are not observed
(or nearly not observable). When the temperature increases up to sample
melting, the intensity of all vibrational bands decreases. After cooling
the film, IR spectra are considerably modified; the spectra and their
temperature dependence are very similar to those subsequently obtained
by heating of the thin film (Figure 4b). At 25 °C, one can observe quite narrow bands
at 2858, 2937, 2954, and 3078 cm–1 assigned to the
C–H stretching and the band at 3322 cm–1 assigned
to the stretching of N–H groups involved into the H-bonds.

dependence of IR spectra of 4 recorded
on (a) powder and (b) thin film. In both cases, the samples were heated
until melting. (c) Schematic representation of the proposed stable,
H-bonded, and self-assembled structure of compound 4 observed
upon cooling.

The absence of any bands
at higher frequencies, which could be
related to free N–H groups, proves that all the groups form
H-bonds. In the case of thin films, we clearly see bands due to C=O
stretching at 1774 cm–1 related to free groups and
at 1722 cm–1 related to groups forming H-bonds of
the type N–H···O (proposed form of compound 4 is shown in Figure 4c). We suggest that in the original sample before melting
the C=O vibrational features are covered with the strong and
broad N–H bending feature at 1627 cm–1, and
they are only evident as weak shoulders at 1670 and 1703 cm–1 (Figure 4a). In conclusion,
the disorder disappears due to compound recrystallization from melt
leading to a new phase of 4, which could be associated
with the aggregates observed with AFM after the SVA step.

The
charge transport properties of all of the synthesized compounds
were tested in field-effect transistors devices and described in the SI. All of the tested compounds, except 1, did not exhibit any semiconducting behavior. This result
can be possibly ascribed to an unfavorable molecular packing of compounds 2, 3, and 4, which could hinder
the charge transport. This interpretation was further supported by
density functional theory (DFT) calculations taking into account solvation
model (PCM) revealing that the HOMO/LUMO energy gaps in DMSO and DCM
for compounds 2–3 had similar values of ca. 4.3
eV, whereas for compounds 1 and 4 the HOMO/LUMO
energy gaps were slightly smaller (Table S2 and Figure S20), which translates in a lower charge transport ability
for such derivatives.

Conclusions
We have designed and
synthesized four pyromellitic diimide derivatives
exposing the different types of side chains to explore their ability
of undergoing self-assembly through diverse noncovalent interactions,
forming ordered architectures. A comparative AFM study revealed that
all derivatives undergo self-assembly on the solid substrates to form
different low-dimensional aggregates. Further information about their
self-assembly behavior was acquired from temperature-dependent IR
spectroscopy and NMR solution studies. In particular, we found that
tetracarboxylic acid derivative 1 forms small monomolecular-thick
2D crystals in a self-assembly process primarily governed by H-bonding
and π–π stacking. Interestingly, by introducing
different side chains to the pyromellitic diimide core, the SIP-induced
assembly changes dramatically. Bundles of crystal-like needles are
in fact observed for the two esters derivatives, that is, pyromellitic
diimide functionalized with OCH3 (2) and OC6H13 (3), whereas more flexible fiberlike
structures are observed for the amide derivative equipped with NHC6H13 side chains (4). The formation
of such fibrillar structures has been primarily determined by the
stacking between molecules (for 2 and/or 3), and intermolecular N–H···O=C–H-bonds
(for 4). This study demonstrates that functionalization
of pyromellitic diimide derivatives with specific side groups can
be used to modify and control the morphology of the supramolecular
aggregates on the solid surface, which could be potentially employed
for tuning the self-assembly of other molecules with high affinity
for π–π stacking, which is highly desirable for
low-cost large-area organic electronics. In addition, monitoring the
morphological changes on the large-scale supramolecular assemblies
can represent an interesting approach for the elucidation of biological
nanosystems or construction of sensory devices.

Experimental Procedures
Synthesis of the compounds 1–4 has been described in the SI.

AFM
morphological characterization was performed in intermittent
contact-mode in a Dimension 3100 microscope equipped with a Nanoscope
IV controller (Digital Instruments). Commercial silicon cantilevers
with a nominal spring constant of 40 N m–1 were
used for morphological characterization in tapping mode. Drops of
0.1 mM solutions of compounds 1–4 were applied to the SiO2 substrates. To induce a fast
aggregation, SIP was exploited by adding aliquots of 1:50 v/v ratio
of solutions in a nonsolvent. In particular, the nonsolvent for compounds 1 and 2 was chloroform, whereas for compounds 3 and 4, it was methanol. The obtained dispersions
(50 μL) were drop-casted onto the SiO2 substrates
and dried in air.

NMR spectra were recorded on the Bruker Fourier
300 MHz (5 mm Fourier 1H/13C probe) and Bruker
400 MHz Avance III HD (5
mm BBFO probe) spectrometers, with standard Bruker pulse sequences.
Spectra were referenced on the solvent residual peaks. NMR solvents
were purchased from Euriso-Top or Deutero GmbH and used as received.

Infrared (IR) absorption spectra were studied within the mid-IR
range (400–4000 cm–1) by using a Bruker Equinox
55 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a KBr beam splitter. For temperature
measurements, the samples were placed on a KBr plate in a THMS 600
Linkam heating stage equipped with a temperature controller. Initially,
the samples in the form of powders were studied at room temperature.
Subsequently, they were heated until melting to obtain thin films
(1, decomposition without melting >230 °C; 2, mp >360 °C; 3, mp >160 °C; 4, mp >250 °C), which were then cooled down and reheated
again. Each temperature cycle was performed in a temperature range
between room temperature and the temperature above melting point.
During such cycles, IR spectra were continuously collected. The sample
melting was visually observed using an optical microscope and in this
way the melting temperature was determined. The rate of sample cooling/heating
was about 2 °C/min.
