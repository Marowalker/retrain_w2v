this paper, we report a direct and quantitative analytical method
of small-biomolecule recognition with a molecularly imprinted polymer
(MIP) interface, taking advantage of the potentiometric principle
of a field-effect transistor (FET) sensor, which enables the direct
detection of ionic charges without using labeling materials such as
fluorescent dyes. The interaction of low-molecular-weight oligosaccharides
such as paromomycin and kanamycin with the MIP interface including
phenylboronic acid (PBA) was directly and quantitatively analyzed
from the electrical signals of an MIP-coated FET sensor. In particular,
the change in the potential response of the FET sensor was derived
on the basis of the multi-Langmuir adsorption isotherm equations,
considering the change in the molecular charges of PBA caused by the
adsorption equilibrium of the analytes with the vinyl PBA-copolymerized
MIP membrane. Thus, the potentiometric adsorption isotherm analysis
can elucidate the formation of selective binding sites at the MIP
interface. The electrochemical analysis of the functional biointerface
used in this study supports the design and construction of sensors
for small biomarkers.

1 Introduction
A molecularly
imprinted polymer (MIP) is an artificially designed
polymer for recognition of a specific molecule, where target-selective
cavities in a polymeric matrix selectively capture the target molecules.1 In particular, an MIP-based device is important
as a bioanalytical material and a tool to capture target biomolecules
without requiring specific reactions such as enzymatic reactions and
antigen–antibody reactions for its molecular recognition. MIPs
can generally be prepared by the following simple steps. First, a
target molecule is mixed with functional monomers to form a target–monomer
complex via either covalent bonds or noncovalent interactions. Then,
the mixture undergoes polymerization in the presence of a high concentration
of cross-linkers. After polymerization, the target molecule is extracted
from the polymer matrix so that a target-selective binding cavity
is formed. This allows the selective rebinding of the target molecules
when the target is reintroduced into the polymer (Scheme 1A). MIPs were first developed
for applications in molecular separation such as chromatography,2,3 but recent advances in surface modification technologies have made
it possible to precisely modify surfaces using polymers, thus opening
up the field of MIP-based biosensors. That is, a target biomolecule
will selectively adhere to the sensor surface modified with a target-selective
MIP, and then the selective adhesion is transduced to a signal in
the sensor, hence enhancing selectivity. Owing to the versatility
of MIPs, more MIP-based biosensors have recently been developed for
the detection of various biocompounds.4−6

MIPs are most commonly characterized using adsorption
isotherm
equations because a target–MIP interaction depends on the binding
equilibrium between target molecules and target-selective cavities
distributed in the polymer matrix.7 In
particular, a batch rebinding assay is most commonly employed, by
which target compounds are determined by immersing the polymer into
a solution with a specific concentration of a target molecule for
a certain duration. Then, the results are calibrated using the adsorption
isotherm equations. The binding property of MIPs is unique in a way
that the binding cavities with different affinities are in most cases
heterogeneously distributed throughout the polymer because of the
randomness of template–monomer interactions and the process
of copolymerization. Therefore, the adsorption isotherm equations
for a heterogeneous distribution such as multi-Langmuir adsorption
isotherm and Freundlich adsorption isotherm equations are often utilized.8 By using these equations, the binding affinity
as well as the homogeneity of the binding-site distribution can be
quantified. In general, MIPs, where cavities with high binding affinity
are homogeneously distributed, are ideal owing to their highest selectivity
for the target molecules.7 Thus, one can
design an improved MIP composition on the basis of the information
obtained by batch rebinding analysis.

Recently, biosensing devices
with an MIP interface have been proposed
for the selective detection of biomolecules; however, the novel functionalities
of the biointerface of such devices should also be evaluated. A surface
plasmon resonance sensor or a quartz crystal microbalance sensor has
an attractive detection principle for biomolecular recognition such
as antigen–antibody reactions but generally has limitations
for use in small-molecule analysis because the signals obtained depend
on the molecular weight of the targets to be determined.9−12 On the other hand, fluorescent or chemiluminescent dyes are used
as labels to detect biomolecules by fluorescence microscopy and enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay but are generally difficult to use as labels for
small molecules.13,14 Therefore, a new analytical method
is required to directly and quantitatively evaluate biointerfacial
characteristics such as the use of MIPs for small-biomolecule recognition.
However, MIP compositions often have to be optimized in a bulk state
before MIPs are applied to sensors. Such processes are not only time-consuming
but may also lead to differences in adhesion properties between the
bulk and the sensor; therefore, a direct analytical methodology for
MIPs is highly desirable.

Because biological activities involve
ions or molecular charges,
potentiometric sensors can be advantageous in the recognition of biological
events. In particular, a field-effect transistor (FET) biosensor can
directly detect the ionic charges at the gate insulator/electrolyte
solution interface on the basis of the field-effect principle (Figure 1).15,16 Therefore, FET biosensors enable the easy detection of not only
ions but also small biomolecules, as long as even small biomolecules
have charges. Moreover, FET biosensors have the potential to realize
low-cost operation/production, portability, and multichannel measurement,
which could lead to next-generation medical diagnostics. For these
reasons, the applications of FET biosensors in the medical fields
have recently been reported, including some biosensors with MIP interfaces
incorporated.17,18 In particular, MIP-based FET
biosensors showed relatively rapid, concentration-dependent responses
and have potential use for building a platform based on molecular
sensors for direct characterization.19

Figure 1 Conceptual
design of an FET biosensor. The Au gate electrode was
connected to the extended gate of a silicon-based n-channel FET, and
gate voltage (VG) was applied through
the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Probe molecules such as MIP, which
selectively bind to analytes but not impurities, are tethered on the
gate electrode of the FET device. Molecular charges of analytes at
the solution/gate electrode interface induce a change in VG at a constant source–drain current (ID) and drain voltage (VD).

Oligosaccharides refer to low-molecular-weight
sugar chains, which
are involved in a wide range of biological events. For instance, some
oligosaccharides are bound to the termini of glycoproteins on the
cellular membrane and play important roles in cellular activities
such as cellular communication and recognition.20 Because some specific oligosaccharides are associated with
various important diseases, they have been increasingly recognized
as important biomarkers.21−23 Other oligosaccharides are aminoglycoside
antibiotics such as paromomycin and kanamycin, which are widely used
as veterinary drugs.24 Because the overuse
of such drugs in the food chain has given rise to serious health risks
to humans, the development of sensors that target these biomolecules
is required.25 Although oligosaccharides
have been recognized as important clinical targets, it remains challenging
to build a clinical platform owing to the limited availability of
lectins and glycan-specific antibodies.26,27 Recently,
we have shown that an FET biosensor combined with an MIP interface
can be applied to the real-time, quantitative sensing of sialyllactose.19

In this paper, we propose a direct and
quantitative analytical
method of small-biomolecule recognition with an MIP interface, taking
advantage of the potentiometric principle of FET sensors, which enables
the direct detection of ionic charges without using labeling materials
such as fluorescent dyes. The interaction of low-molecular-weight
biomolecules with the MIP interface is directly and quantitatively
analyzed from the electrical signals of an MIP-coated FET sensor on
the basis of the multi-Langmuir adsorption isotherm equations (Table
of Content). In particular, oligosaccharides such as paromomycin and
kanamycin (Scheme 2) are utilized as small-biomolecule models to realize a versatile
analytical methodology. The electrochemical and analytical method
including functional biointerfaces used in this study is expected
to support the design and construction of biosensors that directly
and quantitatively detect small-molecule biomarker.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Response of PMIP–FET
Biosensors to
Various Oligosaccharides
To design a sugar-chain-selective
MIP interface on the gate surface, phenylboronic acid (PBA) and methacrylic
acid (MAA) were utilized as target-interacting functional monomers.
PBA has attracted considerable attention in the field of molecular
recognition as it can form stable esters with various biomolecules
containing 1,2 or 1,3 cis-diol/polyol groups, such
as sugars, in aqueous systems (Scheme 1A).29 Moreover, the esterification
of PBA/diol is a reversible reaction, which can be controlled by adjusting
the pH of the solution. Thus, the template can be easily extracted
from the polymer in the preparation of MIPs by simply adjusting the
pH of the solution (Scheme 1B). Moreover, in the esterification, PBA switches from a nonionic
form to an anionic form (Scheme 1A). Hence, the change in molecular charge induced by
the saccharide/PBA binding can be detected by FET biosensors. Indeed,
there have been a few reports on the fabrication of saccharide sensors
using PBA-modified FET biosensors.30−32 MAA is the most commonly
used functional monomer in the preparation of MIPs because of its
versatility in the interaction. MAA was utilized to interact with
amino groups in the paromomycin template to further improve the selectivity
of the biosensor.

To investigate the detection sensitivity and
selectivity of the paromomycin-imprinted polymer (PMIP)–FET
for paromomycin and kanamycin, the changes in the surface potential
of the PMIP–FET sensor were monitored in real time at various
concentrations of each biomolecule, as shown in Figure 2. When paromomycin was introduced into the
measurement solution, the surface potential shifted in the negative
direction. This is because negatively charged tetrahedral PBA molecules
were induced by the paromomycin/PBA complexation on the gate surface/electrolyte
interface. However, even kanamycin, which has a chemical structure
similar to paromomycin, contributed to the change in the surface potential
of the PMIP–FET sensor. Thus, the detection selectivity of
the PMIP–FET sensor for paromomycin appeared to be poor. This
is because the structural similarity of kanamycin to paromomycin may
have enabled kanamycin to enter the cavities of the PMIP membrane,
which may have resulted in the strong response. However, because the
electrical responses shown in Figure 2 were analyzed at relatively high concentrations of
each sample, the detection selectivity of the PMIP–FET sensor
should also be evaluated at lower concentrations, as described in
the next sections (2.2 and 2.3).

Figure 2 Real-time measurement of change in surface potential using the
PMIP–FET biosensor. The responsivity of the PMIP–FET
biosensor to paromomycin and kanamycin was investigated in the range
of concentrations from 5 μM to 10 mM.

2.2 Derivation of Adsorption Isotherm Equations
for MIP–FET Systems
To understand the chemical basis
of interactions between the MIP and the target biomolecules underlying
the electrical responses of the PMIP–FET sensor for paromomycin
and kanamycin, further quantitative analysis was required. In general,
the characteristics of the binding of a target molecule to the MIP
are quantified using adsorption isotherm equations, as the binding
process involves the reversible adhesion of the target molecule to
the target-selective membrane.33 Moreover,
the homogeneity and heterogeneity of binding sites distributed in
MIPs are critical to the effective enhancement of selectivity. In
most cases, the binding sites in MIPs are heterogeneously distributed
because of the randomness of copolymerization and the template/functional
monomer interaction;34,35 therefore, MIPs include both
nonselective and highly selective binding sites at a certain ratio.
In this study, Langmuir and bi-Langmuir adsorption isotherm equations,
which are often used for MIP characterization,36,37 were utilized as the homogeneous and heterogeneous binding models,
respectively, and to derive the corresponding equations for the analysis
of the electrical properties of the MIP–FET system. In this
way, the potentiometric analyses based on the FET sensor can directly
characterize the PMIP interface without the batch rebinding process,
which is often required for MIP characterization. According to a previous
study,33 the Langmuir adsorption isotherm
and bi-Langmuir adsorption isotherm equations for a bulk rebinding
system are expressed by 1   2  where B refers to
a signal
observed at equilibrium for the MIP-bound template, [c] to the free concentration of the template at equilibrium, N to the number of available active centers in the MIP per
unit volume, and K to the binding constant. Equation 1 assumes homogeneously
distributed binding sites with a constant binding constant K. On the other hand, eq 2 assumes two main types of binding sites with different
affinities distributed at a ratio of N1/N2 in the polymer, that is, a heterogeneous
system.

The operation of a silicon-based FET (Figure 1) in the unsaturated region
can generally be described by 3  where ID is the
drain current, μ is the electron mobility in the channel, COX is the gate oxide capacitance, W/L is the channel width-to-length ratio, VD and VG are the
applied drain–source and gate–source voltages, respectively,
and VT is the threshold voltage, which
can be expressed by38 4  where Eref is
the reference electrode potential relative to vacuum; (−ψ0 + χsol) describes the interfacial potential
at the electrolyte/Au gate electrode interface (the factor χsol is the surface dipole moment of the solution, which can
be considered to be constant); ϕsi/q is the silicon electron work function; Qit, Qf, and QB are the charge of the interface traps, the fixed oxide charge, and
the bulk depletion charge per unit area, respectively; and ϕf is the Fermi potential difference between the doped bulk
silicon and the intrinsic silicon.

Considering the PMIP membrane
on the Au gate electrode of the extended-gate
FET (Figure 1), the
capacitance and charge in the PMIP membrane should be added to eq 4 and can be expressed by 5  with 6  where QMIP is
the charge in the PMIP membrane and CCom is the combined capacitance of the FET gate oxide (COX) and the PMIP membrane (CMIP) on the Au gate electrode. In this study, it is assumed that CMIP hardly changed even after the addition of
targeted molecules, considering our previous results for a similar
hydrogel;28 therefore, CCom was nearly constant regardless of the adsorption of
small molecules because COX was also constant.
Moreover, the change in interfacial potential (Δψ0) at the electrolyte/Au gate electrode interface should not
change because the ionic concentration (i.e., pH) was basically maintained
by using the buffer solution. Also, Eref, ϕsi/q, Qit, Qf, QB, and ϕf should be the same before and after
the molecular recognition events at the MIP interface. Thus, the signal
response obtained using the FET sensor is based on the change in VT (ΔVT); therefore,
ΔQMIP should be evaluated in this
study, in accordance with eq 5 and the above considerations.

The binding affinity
of PBA to a diol is pH-dependent, but it is
generally understood that the B(OH)3– complex is much more stable than the B(OH)2 complex,
as shown in a previous work.39 For the
reversible interaction between paromomycin (P) and PBA in the MIP
membrane (Scheme 1B) 7  the rate of formation of the P·PBA– complex at time t is written as 8  where ka is the
association rate constant and kd is the
dissociation rate constant. At time t, [PBA] = [PBA]0 – [P·PBA–], where [PBA]0 is the concentration of PBA at t = 0. This
is substituted into eq 8 to give 9  

In this study, the
charge QMIP is derived
from reaction 7; therefore, it is proportional
to the formation of the P·PBA– complex in the
PMIP membrane. Additionally, Qmax is proportional
to the concentration of PBA in the PMIP membrane ([PBA]0 at t = 0), which indicates the capacity of the
immobilized ligand. Therefore, eq 9 is modified to 10  where  is the rate
of formation of the associated
complex (P·PBA–) in the PMIP membrane (on the
Au gate) and [c] is the concentration of the analyte
(P) in the solutions. Moreover, integrating eq 10 gives 11  where Ka is the
stability constant of P and PBA (ka/kd) in the PMIP membrane. From eq 11, QMIPt=0 = 0. Considering eq 5, 12  which is estimated after
a certain reaction
time t. Here, ΔVoutmax is the maximum
change in surface potential induced by ΔQmax, which is proportional to the number of binding sites.
In this study, ΔVout at the gate
was measured at a constant ID using the
source follower circuit shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). Therefore, the detected ΔVout was regarded as the change in VGS, which was proportional to −ΔVT at a constant ID.

According to the above considerations, the electrical signal in
the entire FET circuit should obey the Langmuir adsorption model.
By modifying eqs 1 and 2 in accordance with eq 12, the adsorption isotherm equations for the
MIP–FET system are obtained as 13   14  where [c] is determined as
the concentration of the target biomolecule at equilibrium, which
is obtained from the saturated electrical signal in real-time measurement.

2.3 Quantification of the MIP Effect Using Adsorption
Isotherm Equations
The data shown in Figure 2 were analyzed using eqs 13 and 14. First, ΔVout was calculated for each concentration of
the target biomolecule by subtracting Vout at t = 0 from Vout at
each concentration. Then, the resultant data were plotted versus the
target concentration, as shown in Figure 3A. ΔVout was the average of 10 data plots taken 5 min after the addition
of the target. The best-fit adsorption isotherm equations were determined
by optimizing K and ΔVoutmax using the
application software to minimize R2 (in
Microsoft Excel). Then, ΔVoutmax and the average binding affinity Kavr were expressed by 15   16

potential as a function of target concentrations

(Filled circle, open circle, and filled square show the addition of

and kanamycin into PMIP–FET, respectively.) (B) Comparison
of the addition of paromomycin into PMIP–FET with that of kanamycin
at low concentrations of less than 100 μM.

Table 1 shows
the
optimized values for the paromomycin/PMIP, paromomycin/nonimprinted
polymer (NIP), and kanamycin/PMIP interactions in the MIP/NIP–FET
measurement systems. The fitting curves are also shown in Figure 3A. From Table 1, the value of R2 shows that the adsorption isotherm equations
were successfully applied to the PMIP/NIP–FET measurement systems;
thus, the assumptions made in the derivation were valid. K2 and ΔV2_outmax in the case of adding paromomycin
to NIP were zero, which indicated that the result fitted the Langmuir
adsorption isotherm, indicating in turn that the binding sites were
homogeneously distributed in NIP. However, there were no paromomycin-selective
binding sites in NIP. Thus, the signal probably originated from nonspecific
adsorption on the surface of NIP. Meanwhile, the paromomycin/PMIP
interaction fitted the bi-Langmuir adsorption isotherm equation, indicating
the heterogeneous distribution of binding sites. That is, from Table 1, two different types
of paromomycin-binding sites were found, one with high binding affinity
(K1 = 6970 M–1) and
the other with low binding affinity (K2 = 73 M–1). Moreover, the number of binding sites
(proportional to ΔV1_outmax) corresponding to K1 was much smaller even for the paromomycin/PMIP interaction,
as similarly observed previously in the MIP produced by noncovalent
interactions.33 In designing the PMIP for
its interaction with paromomycin, PBA was assumed to be a covalently
interacting functional monomer and MAA was assumed to be a noncovalently
interacting one. Considering the equilibrium reaction shown in Scheme 1B, moreover, some
PBAs might be used for the interaction with the template, paromomycin,
in the PMIP membrane but not rebind to the target, paromomycin, even
upon adding it, resulting in noncovalent interactions in the PMIP
membrane. These noncovalently interacting monomers should be heterogeneously
distributed and randomly functioned in the PMIP membrane, and then
noncovalent, hydrogen bonding may be screened by water molecules in
an aqueous solution; thus, the number of well-bound complexes was
assumed to be small. In the FET measurement, the largest difference
between the PMIP and NIP interfaces that interacted with paromomycin
was found in ΔVoutmax, which was proportional to the total
number of binding sites. As shown in Figure 3A, the concentration of paromomycin added
to the NIP–FET reached a maximum of approximately 5 mM (170
mV), but the PMIP–FET showed a much higher ΔVoutmax (415
mV (according to eq 15) at 850 mM in calculation) upon adding paromomycin. Thus, the difference
between MIP and NIP was clearly demonstrated using the potentiometric
adsorption isotherm equations derived from the MIP–FET measurement
system.

Table 1 Summary of the Optimized Values of K and ΔV Based on the Bi-Langmuir
Adsorption Isotherm Equation
 	K1 (M–1)	ΔV1_outmax (mV)	K2 (M–1)	ΔV2_outmax (mV)	Kavr (M–1)	ΔVoutmax (mV)	R2	
P/PMIP	6970	95	73	320	1070	415	0.998	
P/NIP	2060	170	0	0	2060	170	0.994	
K/PMIP	2800	240	0	0	2800	240	0.998	
A similar trend was observed by comparing
the addition of paromomycin
with that of kanamycin to the PMIP–FET devices. Although the
binding affinity of kanamycin was higher on average (Kavr = 2800 M–1 according to eq 16), the selectivity of
PMIP for paromomycin was better than expected at concentrations of
less than 100 μM, as shown in Figure 3B. Initially, the addition of kanamycin to
the PMIP–FET system fitted the Langmuir adsorption isotherm
equation, similar to the addition of paromomycin to the NIP–FET
system. This indicated that the detection of kanamycin using the PMIP–FET
system was also based on the nonspecific adsorption of kanamycin to
the binding sites with low affinity (K2 and ΔV2_outmax in the case of adding kanamycin to PMIP
were zero). On the other hand, the binding sites with higher affinity
were crucial at lower concentrations of target molecules. Figure 3B shows the change
in surface potential at the lower concentrations of less than 100
μM of paromomycin and kanamycin using the PMIP–FET sensors.
From this result, paromomycin was detected more sensitively than kanamycin
at the lower concentrations. That is, a target molecule at a lower
concentration will first bind to high-affinity binding sites. Thus,
the effect of K1 on the selectivity of
PMIP for paromomycin was very important at the low concentrations
of paromomycin until the signal reached ΔV1_outmax. Additionally,
the limit of detection for paromomycin using the PMIP–FET sensor
in this study was predicted to be 2.3 μM from the semilogarithmic
plots in the range of 100 μM to 5.8 mM shown in Figure 3A, obtained from the Kaiser
limit theory.40 This means that the higher
selectivity of PMIP for paromomycin than kanamycin at concentrations
of less than 100 μM should be ensured down to 2.3 μM.
Therefore, the potentiometric adsorption isotherm analysis using the
MIP–FET device can elucidate the formation of selective binding
sites at the MIP interface. The electrochemical analysis of the functional
biointerface used in this study is expected to support the design
and construction of sensors for small biomarkers.

Additionally,
the heterogeneous distribution of binding sites in
PMIP was also analyzed using the potentiometric Freundlich adsorption
isotherm in the same way as in the Langmuir analysis, which is expressed
by 17  where a includes the number
of available active centers N in the MIP per unit
volume and the adsorption constant KF and m indicates the heterogeneity of the MIP interface (0 < m < 1). A change in the amount of adsorbate (paromomycin)
induces a change in the molecular charge (ΔQ) on the basis of the equilibrium reaction 7, resulting in a change in the output voltage of ΔVout. In fact, the paromomycin/PMIP interaction, which
fitted the bi-Langmuir adsorption isotherm equation, also fitted the
Freundlich adsorption isotherm equation, giving a = 1.35 and m = 0.38. These calculated values are
similar to those obtained for the adsorption of hydrocarbons on a
hydrophobic adsorbent such as activated carbon.41 However, the Freundlich equation is based on an empirical
rule and may not be valid for evaluating the detection selectivity
of an MIP interface for target molecules at low concentrations by
comparison with the Langmuir and bi-Langmuir adsorption isotherms.
The Henry isotherm may be used to show the correlation between ΔVout and [c] in a dilute solution,
although the potentiometric bi-Langmuir adsorption isotherm analysis
clarified the detection selectivity at low concentrations of less
than 100 μM, as mentioned in this paper.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, we introduced a direct and quantitative
analytical
method of small-biomolecule recognition with an MIP interface, taking
advantage of the potentiometric principle of FET sensors. To realize
the direct and quantitative analysis of the interaction of target
molecules with the MIP or NIP interface, Langmuir and bi-Langmuir
isotherm equations were derived depending on the changes in surface
potential, which were caused by molecular charges of the P·PBA– complexes in the PMIP membrane, at the sensor surface.
Then, the derived equations were applied to the measured change in
the surface potential for the addition of paromomycin and kanamycin
to the PMIP– and PNIP–FET systems. Although a better
signal was observed upon the addition of kanamycin to PMIP–FET
than that of paromomycin on average, and hence the detection selectivity
of PMIP–FET to paromomycin seemed to be poor, the isotherm
analysis revealed the differences in adsorption characteristics between
paromomycin and kanamycin and the high selectivity of paromomycin
to the PMIP interface at lower concentrations. In conclusion, a platform
based on the potentiometric adsorption isotherm analysis is suitable
for the elucidation of the formation of selective binding sites at
the MIP interface. In particular, the advantage of FET sensors for
the evaluation of MIP interfaces is that they enable the recognition
of small biomolecules because ionic charges can be easily detected
using FET sensors, even for small biomolecules. Such an electrochemical
analysis contributes to the design and construction of sensors for
small biomarkers.

Finally, we comment on the magnitude of the
electrical responses.
The PMIP–FET sensor produced larger signals than the other
sensors even upon adding kanamycin. This may be because the PMIP–FET
sensor had template-specific cavities for paromomycin in PMIP; therefore,
paromomycin was captured by these cavities, making it more difficult
for it to pass through the MIP interface to the Au substrate, while
kanamycin more easily passed through the MIP interface to the Au substrate
because such template-specific cavities became vacancies for kanamycin.
Hence, the PMIP–FET sensor may have readily responded to kanamycin
at the Au electrode. This is also true for the NIP–FET sensor
because both cases fitted the Langmuir adsorption isotherm equation
rather than the bi-Langmuir adsorption isotherm equation. Therefore,
the effect of the material used as a substrate on nonspecific signals
should be investigated in the future.

4.2 Designing
a Sugar-Chain-Imprinted Polymer
Interface
In the design of the paromomycin-selective MIP,
VPBA and MAA were utilized as functional monomers. MAA was targeted
to interact with the amino groups of paromomycin. As shown in Scheme 1A, VPBA was used
to interact with diols on the sugar rings. Moreover, VPBA can induce
a change in surface charges through the ionization derived by the
complexation reaction. The sensing surface was functionalized by MIPs
through free-radical copolymerization. Because paromomycin can only
be dissolved in an aqueous solution, MBAAm was chosen as a hydrophobic
cross-linker. DMAPMAAm was used to control the pH, and HEMA was used
to improve the hydrophilicity of the polymer. TEMED was used as an
initiator. Controlling the pH was important because the PBA–sugar
binding is pH-dependent. The fundamental properties of the polymers,
such as thickness, morphology, and swelling properties, were characterized
in a previous work,28 where the chemical
structure of the characterized hydrogel was similar to that of the
polymers used in this study.

4.3 Fabrication of the MIP-Modified
Extended Au
Gate Electrode
An approximately 100 nm thick Au thin film
over an approximately 15 nm thick Cr layer was sputtered on a transparent
glass slide (Matsunami Glass). A polycarbonate ring (18 mm inner diameter/20
mm outer diameter) was encapsulated on the Au substrate using an epoxy
resin (Pelnox ZC-203T) excluding the sensing surface. The Au substrate
was immersed in a piranha solution (1/3 vol % mixture of H2O2 and H2SO4) for 10 min and then
thoroughly rinsed with distilled water. The Au sensing surface was
then kept in a UV ozone cleaner (Meiwafosis) to remove and prevent
the adhesion of organic compounds before the copolymerization of the
hydrogel.

PMIP was prepared on the Au electrode by free-radical
polymerization. A prepolymer solution (1 mL) was prepared by dissolving
the following chemicals in a mixture of 3/2 vol % H2O/DMSO
in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube: paromomycin (30 mM), VPBA (60 mM), MAA
(300 mM), MBAAm (200 mM), HEMA (400 mM), and DMAPMAAm (300 mM). TEMED
(2 μL) was added to the mixture, and the mixture was deoxygenated
with N2 gas for 20 min. Then, 100 μL of the solution
was transferred to a 500 μL tube, and 5 μL of a stock
solution of 50 mg/mL APS was added. The 5 μL mixture was placed
on the Au sensing surface, which was then covered with a thin fluorine-coated
poly(ethylene terephthalate) PET film, and the Au surface was allowed
to undergo polymerization for 24 h at room temperature (rt) in a N2 environment. After polymerization, the PET film was carefully
removed, and the resulting polymer-coated Au electrode was immersed
in 0.1 M HCl in 1/1 vol % methanol/water for 24 h to extract the template
molecule, paromomycin. For the comparative experiment, a NIP was prepared
using the same procedure but without the addition of paromomycin to
the prepolymer solution.

4.4 FET Real-Time Measurement
The MIP/NIP
Au electrode was connected to the extended gate of a silicon-based
n-channel junction-type FET (K246-Y9A, Toshiba), and gate voltage
was applied through the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Gate surface
potential was measured in real time using an FET real-time monitoring
system (Optogenesys). In this study, constant-charge mode operation
was used for all the measurements, where VG, VD, and IDS were set to constant values and ΔVout at the gate was measured using the source follower circuit shown
in Figure S1 (Supporting Information).
Thus, Vout is a measure of changes in
the surface potential or threshold voltage.

In the measurement,
the sensing surface was covered with 1.5 mL of PBS (pH 7.4), and the
source–drain current flow was controlled to 700 μA with
a gate voltage of 0 V. After the stabilization of the surface potential,
analytes of various concentrations were added to the solution. The
concentration was controlled by exchanging 15 μL of the buffer
and the analyte solution to give a 100-fold dilution. A stock solution
of analyte solution was prepared beforehand and stored at 4 °C.
The solution was allowed to warm to rt 1 h before the measurement
to avoid the effect of a temperature change.
