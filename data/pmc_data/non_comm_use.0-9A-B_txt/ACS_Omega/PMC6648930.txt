Herein,
we have described uniformly dispersed palladium–nickel
nanoparticles furnished on graphene oxide (GO-supported PdNi nanoparticles)
as a powerful heterogeneous nanocatalyst for the promotion of Knoevenagel
reaction between malononitrile and aromatic aldehydes under mild reaction
conditions. The successful characterization of PdNi nanoparticles
on the GO surface was shown by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM),
and TEM. GO-supported PdNi nanoparticles, which are used as highly
efficient, stable, and durable catalysts, were used for the first
time for the Knoevenagel condensation reaction. The data obtained
here showed that the GO-supported PdNi nanocatalyst had a unique catalytic
activity and demonstrated that it could be reused five times without
a significant decrease in the catalytic performance. The use of this
nanocatalyst results in a very short reaction time under mild reaction
conditions, high recyclability, excellent catalytic activity, and
a straightforward work-up procedure for Knoevenagel condensation of
malononitrile and aromatic aldehydes.

1 Introduction
Knoevenagel
condensation of benzylidenemalonitrile (BMN) derivatives
of aryl aldehydes is a diverse
group of valuable organic intermediates that are adaptable to many
synthetic reaction transformations, and biologically valuable molecules
such as carbohydrates, heterocycles, and different types of enzyme
inhibitions are used.1−5 The Knoevenagel condensation of aldehydes with activated carbon-containing
compounds is an essential and powerful tool in the synthesis of fine
chemicals as well as some heterocyclic compounds that have biological
significance.6−10 A perusal of the literature reveals many examples of heterogeneous
catalysts for the Knoevenagel condensation reaction, such as metal–organic
framework (MOF)–NH2,11,12 MOF–Pd,13 PMOV1,14 Zn@ZIF-67,15 ZIF-8,16 chitosan,17 Cd(II)-based coordination polymers,18 Ni(II)-based coordination polymers,19 PdAlO(OH),20 mesoporous
titanosilicate,21 basic MCM-41 silica,22 and acid–base bifunctional mesoporous
MCM-41 silica.23 However, many of these
catalysts generally suffer from disadvantages such as low reaction
yields, tedious work-up procedures, harsh reaction conditions, toxic
and expensive solvents or chemicals, prolonged reaction times, and
low reusability. Therefore, further efforts are needed toward the
development of more efficient and reusable heterogeneous nanocatalysts
to achieve mild and green reaction conditions.24−29 In recent studies, researchers have focused on these properties
to synthesize BMN derivatives to benefit from the important catalytic
properties of heterogeneous nanocatalysts such as reusability, easy
removal from the reaction medium, and recyclability.11−17,19−23 Following the development of a new heterogeneous
catalyst to increase the reaction rate,7,30−33 in the current work, we report a clean and environmentally friendly
synthetic method to obtain benzylidenemalonitrile derivatives of aryl
aldehydes by using the efficient nanocatalyst graphene oxide (GO)-supported
PdNi nanoparticles. For the catalyst in which palladium, nickel, and
graphene oxide with different coordination constraints are present,
changes in the reaction rate are expected due to the synergistic effect
of the two metals. For this reason, the current heterogeneous GO-supported
PdNi nanocomposites have been used for the first time, to the best
of our knowledge, as a nanocatalyst for the two-component Knoevenagel
condensation of malononitrile and aromatic aldehydes under mild conditions
to produce compounds in high yields. All reactions were carried out
by using the water/ethanol (v/v, 1:1) solvent system at room temperature.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Uniformly
Dispersed GO-Supported
PdNi Nanoparticles
Preliminary characterization of GO-supported
PdNi NPs was performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and
high-resolution (HR)-TEM methods. Monodisperse GO-supported PdNi NPs
were produced in the presence of K2PdCl4 and
NiCl2 using an ultrasonic double-reduction method. In the
next step, a solution was obtained, which was refluxed for 2 h, followed
by reduction of the resulting brownish black Ni2+ and Pd2+ ions, Ni(0) and Pd(0), from their bimetallic nanoparticles.
Composition analyses results, microstructural properties, and morphology
of PdNi@GO nanoparticles using TEM were obtained as observed in Figure 1. In this figure,
it was observed that the average maximum particle size was around
3.28 ± 0.35 nm. The HR-TEM image of the catalyst components was
obtained, in which they were found to be spherical as shown in Figure 1. Also, monodisperse
and stable Pd–Ni@GO nanoparticles were obtained from HR-TEM
for visualization of atomic lattice fringes. These fringes are found
to be 0.21 nm, which is a bit smaller than the nominal Pd (111) range
of 0.22 nm.34,35 This case indicates that the
prepared materials are alloys. Besides, the inductively coupled plasma
indicates that the Pd/Ni ratio is nearly 1:1 (Pd54Ni46).

PdNi nanoparticles.

In the XRD spectrum of Figure 2, the crystal structure
and the average crystallite
size of the palladium–nickel nanoparticles supported on the
graphene oxide is shown. A slight breakdown peak shift was observed
in the prepared nanomaterials, as compared with pure Pd, showing the
GO-supported PdNi NP alloy formation as seen in Figure 2. The peak for graphene oxide was observed
at around 11.34°. The strong signals of the prepared materials
are mostly from Pd metals as shown in Figure 2. The observed peaks at around 2θ =
42.1, 47.5, 68.7, and 83.3°, which relate to (111), (200), (220),
and (311) indicate the face-centered cubic structure of the prepared
materials. Besides, the calculation of the mean crystalline particle
size of monodisperse GO-supported PdNi nanoparticles was performed
using the Scherrer equation. As a result of this calculation, the
crystalline particle size was found to be around 3.42 ± 0.38
nm;34−39 further, using the following equation, lattice parameter values
of GO-supported PdNi nanoparticles were calculated as 3.88 Å,
which is close to the pure Pd value of 3.89 Å.40−42  The oxidation state of nickel and palladium
metals in monodisperse GO-supported PdNi nanoparticles was determined
using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Using the Gaussian–Lorentzian
method, the Ni 2p and Pd 3d regions of the spectrum were analyzed.
As a reference, the C 1s peak was used at 286.4 eV and the correct
binding energy was determined (± 0.3 eV) in all XPS spectra of
the prepared materials.39,40

Figure 2 XRD patterns of GO-supported
PdNi NPs and Pd@GO NPs.

For the prepared materials, experimental binding energies
of Pd
3d and Ni 2p were found (Figure 3), and it is shown that palladium and nickel are mostly
in the zero oxidation states. There are also some oxidized and unreduced
species like the 2+ oxidation states of Pd and Ni. The shift of the
binding energy of nickel to the 2p3/2 peak indicates the
alloying of nickel with palladium at a low energy.39,40

nanoparticles.

After full characterization
of GO-supported PdNi NPs, their catalytic
performance was evaluated for the synthesis by the Knoevenagel condensation
reaction of malononitrile and aromatic aldehydes. In this study, our
goal was to synthesize the compounds with a minimum amount of nanocatalyst
and solvent in a very short reaction time at room temperature. Hence,
to find the optimized reaction conditions, various reaction parameters
such as solvent systems, the amount of nanocatalyst, and the reaction
time were examined. Benzaldehyde and malononitrile were chosen as
model reactants. Various solvents and solvent systems were used, such
as acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol, water, dichloromethane, isoproponal,
and different ethanol and water combinations. From the model reaction,
ethanol and water in a 1:1 (v/v) combination gave the best results
with the shortest reaction time and the highest yield among them.
The reaction was also carried out with different amounts of monodisperse
GO-supported PdNi NPs as the nanocatalyst at room temperature and
it was found that 2 mg of GO-supported PdNi NPs was enough for the
maximum catalytic performance. It can be concluded that 2 mg of GO-supported
PdNi NPs is the amount of catalyst needed to conduct this Knoevenagel
condensation reaction with ethanol/water (1:1) as a solvent system
at room temperature (Table 1).

a Reaction conditions:

The optimized reaction conditions
were further extended to utilize
monodisperse GO-supported PdNi nanoparticles in the two-component
Knoevenagel condensation of various aromatic aldehydes with malononitrile
to produce benzylidenemalononitrile (BMN) derivatives. The results
of the obtained products are summarized in Table 2. All reactions were successfully carried
out using malononitrile (1.1 mmol), aromatic aldehyde (1 mmol), and
the nanocatalyst GO-supported PdNi (2 mg) in a water/EtOH (1:1) mixture
as the solvent at room temperature. The corresponding BMN derivatives
were obtained in high yields within 5–10 min.

GO-Supported PdNi Nanocatalyst with Aromatic Aldehydes and Malononitrile
The reusability and recoverability
of the monodisperse GO-supported
PdNi nanocatalysts were also examined to test their stability as shown
using the model reaction under standardized reaction conditions. This
recycling study shows that the prepared heterogeneous nanocatalyst
GO-supported PdNi can be reused over five successive runs without
any significant decrease of catalytic performance (Figure 4). There is only a slight decrease
in the catalytic performance of the catalysts due to the leaching
of the prepared catalyst. Lastly, as illustrated in Table 3, on a comparison, it was observed
that the prepared nanocatalyst system of GO-supported PdNi had one
of the best catalytic performances for the model reaction as compared
with that of other catalyst systems in the literature.

3 Conclusions
As a conclusion, an efficient, clean, environmentally friendly,
and simple synthetic method was reported for the two-component Knoevenagel
condensation reaction of aromatic aldehydes and malononitrile. For
the first time, the highly monodisperse GO-supported PdNi nanocatalyst
was successfully applied to these types of reactions. The prepared
nanomaterials were fully characterized using many techniques and it
was found that the prepared nanomaterials were homogeneously dispersed
on the surface of GO. The corresponding benzylidenemalononitriles
were obtained in excellent yields within 5–10 min by using
the monodisperse GO-supported PdNi nanocatalyst under mild reaction
conditions (water/ethanol, 1:1) at room temperature. Also, the model
reaction carried out with the help of the prepared GO-supported PdNi
nanoparticles has some superior advantageous such as a safe, simple
work-up procedure, very short reaction times, great yields, and ambient
reaction conditions. On the other hand, the prepared nanocatalyst
could be recovered and reused several times in the subsequent runs
without any significant loss of activity. After all, the prepared
monodisperse nanomaterials can also be used for many other types of
reactions as a catalyst.

4 Material and Methods
4.1 Preparation of GO-Supported PdNi Nanocomposites
Graphene
oxide was synthesized using the hummers method46 and its characterization was presented in our
previous works.47 GO-supported PdNi nanoparticles
were obtained by the ultrasonic double-reduction method36,37,48 stabilized by graphene oxide.
Initially, an ultrasonic agitation was performed, and then 2.5 mmol
GO, 0.25 mmol NiCl2, and 0.25 mmol K2PdCl4 were added. In the subsequent process, reflux was performed
for the mixture obtained at 90 °C for 2 h. After this process,
the mixture that has been taken to room temperature is allowed to
cool down here. Palladium–nickel nanomaterials stabilized by
graphene oxide are seen in a brownish black color. In the experiment,
the homogeneity of the catalyst and the stability at the same location
gave outstanding results.

4.2 Two-Component General Synthetic
Procedure
of Malononitrile and Aromatic Aldehydes Using Knoevenagel Condensation
First, 2 mg of nanocatalyst (GO-supported PdNi nanoparticles),
1 mmol aldehyde derivative, and 1.1 mmol malononitrile were added
to 10 mL of water/ethanol (v/v, 1:1) in a vessel, and the mixture
was sealed after mixing. The reaction mixture was continuously stirred
at room temperature. The reaction was continued for 5–10 min,
depending on the substitution of aldehydes. After the completion of
the reaction (thin layer chromatography monitoring), the catalyst
was centrifuged at 7500 rpm. Then, the nanocatalyst was recycled,
washed several times with ethanol and water, and reused after drying.
In the next process, the catalyst was rewashed in ethanol and water
to be used again and then dried. The resulting solution was evaporated
under vacuum and products were purified by column chromatography for
use (EtOAc/hexane 1:5). The obtained final pure products were characterized
by 1H NMR and 13C NMR analysis (see Supporting Information for the spectra).
