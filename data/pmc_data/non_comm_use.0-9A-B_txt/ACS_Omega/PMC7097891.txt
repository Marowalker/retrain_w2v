Global concerns regarding climate
change and the energy crisis
have stimulated, among other things, research on renewable and sustainable
materials. In relation to that, hydrothermal carbonization of wet
biomass has been shown to be a low-cost method for the production
of hydrochars. Such hydrochars can be refined into materials that
can be used in water purification, for CO2 capture, and
in the energy sector. Here, we review the use of metal ions and particles
to catalyze the formation of hydrochars and related hybrid materials.
First, the effects of using silver, cobalt, tellurium, copper ions,
and particles on the hydrothermal carbonization of simple sugars and
biomass are discussed. Second, we discuss the structural effects of
iron ions and particles on the hydrochars in conjunction with their
catalytic effects on the carbonization. Among the catalysts, iron
ions or oxides have low cost and allow magnetic features to be introduced
in carbon-containing hybrid materials, which seems to be promising
for commercial applications.

==== Body
Introduction
The
global warming, energy crisis, and various aspects of environmental
pollution are concurrent critical issues. Aside from various policies
and political measures, technological and scientific approaches are
important to mediate the associated impact. Related research is focused
on renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and the use of sustainable
and renewable resources. This review deals with recent developments
in the use of metal ions and metal oxide particles for the synthesis
of hydrochars, which can be derived from wet biomass in a cost- and
energy-effective way.

Hydrochars are solid products formed during
hydrothermal carbonization
(HTC) of biomass or carbohydrates in aqueous media at usually 180–250
°C.1 This process was developed by
Bergius2 as a way to imitate nature’s
way to make coal and has recently been revisited using precursors
such as xylose, glucose, fructose, ribose, furfural, and biomass such
as coconut shells.3,4

The formation of hydrochars
is complex because of the multitude
of simultaneous chemical reactions that occur during the hydrothermal
treatment (Figure 1). Generally, the process first starts with the hydrolysis of saccharides
into monomers, with glucose and fructose being the most abundant in
lignocellulosic biomass. These molecules can then, under the hydrothermal
conditions (set temperatures and self-generated pressures), decompose,
dehydrate, and fragment, leading to the formation of smaller, condensed,
and more reactive species. As glucose and fructose, as mentioned above,
are the main constituents of lignocellulosic biomass, the result of
these series of reactions are mainly hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF),
furfural, as well as some aldehydes.5 These
more reactive species undergo a series of cascade chemical reactions
that include decomposition (to aldehydes, phenols, and organic acids)
as well as polymerization, condensation (inter- and intramolecular),
and aromatization reactions. These additive reactions ultimately form
what is known as hydrochar.1

Figure 1 Generally accepted
scheme of the mechanistic model of hydrothermal
carbonization.

There is no significant difference
between the formation of hydrochar
during HTC and that of humins in nature. As previously stated, HTC
is a process designed from observing and mimicking nature. In studies
done regarding the mechanism of formation of humins, it is thought
that the tautomerization of glucose and fructose is of key importance
for control in the formation of humins/hydrochar.6 Glucose must first tautomerize to fructose, which can then
more readily dehydrate into HMF, a more reactive species as well as
an important platform chemical in biorefinery processes.

The
hydrochars obtained from HTC have been researched to be used
as such for soil improvement and water treatment.7 Compared to biochars derived by pyrolysis, it can be argued
that hydrochars possess some environmental advantages in relation
to the thermodynamics and limited amounts of formed volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) and CO2,8 and
they can be derived directly from wet biomass. Hydrochars can also
be refined into activated carbons with applications in water purification
and gas separation;9,10 superparamagentic iron oxide
particles can be included and give magnetic properties to the activated
carbons.10

The chemical composition
and molecular features of hydrochars have
been studied with many methods, and in particular, multidimensional
solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy has been successful at
revealing the detailed polymeric composition of hydrochars when prepared
from glucose.11 As expected, the carbon
content in hydrochars is positively affected by the temperature and
time used for the HTC. When being prepared below a critical aromatization
temperature, hydrochars derived from glucose consist of mainly polymerized
polyfuranic chains related to the HMF that forms on the hydrothermal
treatment. At long dwelling time and high temperature, the furanic
rings undergo intermolecular condensation and decarboxylation, and
the hydrochars obtain aromatic features.12 The hydrochars are also rich in carbonyl groups, and by increasing
the temperature for the HTC, such functional groups are reduced in
number. The morphological features of the hydrochar particles are
very similar for such prepared from pure sugars and certain polysaccharides.
For example, monodisperse hydrochar particles from HTC of sucrose
are typically spheres.3 One possibility
is that these spherical particles are being formed by phase-separated
HMF and oligomers thereof, which are subsequently condensed; however,
there are other possibilities of the formation of the spheres, and
from our perspective, further detailed studies are needed.

Use of Metal
Ions during Hydrochar Formation
Bergius2 showed that various metal ions
catalyzed the carbonization of sugars, and metal ions and particles
affect the involved chemical reactions, which, in turn, impacts the
structure, composition, and morphology of carbonaceous materials derived
from hydrochars.13 Yu et al. demonstrated
that the addition of dissolved AgNO3 led to the formation
of fiber-like hydrochar structures, accelerated the HTC of starch,
and increased the yield of the hydrochar.14 Yu et al. argued that Ag+ ions are reduced to Ag(0) nanoparticles
by the reducing d-glucose obtained from the hydrolysis of
starch. The Ag nanoparticles, in turn, catalyzed the carbonization
reaction, and the yield increased from 18 to 54%.14 We argue that the HMF, furan, and aldehydes from the dehydration
and decomposition of glucose were simultaneously polymerized around
the nanoparticles that formed aggregated chains of particles. A gel-like
layer of hydrochar was formed around the chains of Ag-based nanoparticles,
which densified into a fiber-like structure by increasing the dwelling
time of the reaction. As shown in Figure 2, some of the hydrochar fibers were partially
filled with Ag particles. The formation rate for the Ag(0) nanoparticles
and their associated concentration depended on the glucose concentration.15 As a result, the rate of reaction was controlled
by the glucose concentration, which was dehydrated into HMF and furfural
and consumed during the HTC reaction.

In a comparative manner, Yu et al. used Cu(CH3COO)2 for the hydrothermal treatment of starch and obtained similar
fibrous and hollow structures for the hydrochars.14 Cu2+ was reduced to Cu(0) nanoparticles by d-glucose, although Cu2+ has a lower reduction potential
(E0 = 0.34 V) compared to that of Ag+(E0 = 0.8 V). The reason for the
Cu2+ reduction can be attributed to increased redox potentials
at high temperatures.16 The formation mechanism
of the Cu-encapsulated hydrochars seemed to be similar to what was
observed for the carbon fibers with encapsulated and aggregated Ag(0)
nanoparticles. When Yu et al., in the same study,14 studied the HTC of starch with dissolved Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 and subsequently treated
the hydrochars at 800 °C, they observed that hollow spheres of
graphene had formed. It was highlighted that nanoparticles of Ag(0),
Cu(0), and Fe(0) were involved in the alignment of the fiber-like
hydrochars. In a related study, Chen et al. studied the effect of
cobalt compounds on the HTC of furfural, and when Co(acac)2 was used, hydrochar particles with a flower-like structure were
observed.17 They argued that the concurrent
formation of CoO crystals was important to the morphology of the particles
formed. Carbon-rich spheres were observed when Co(NO3)2 or CoCl2 were used. Co2+ has been shown
to form clusters with furfural.18 We speculate
that when the hydrothermal reaction proceeded, furfurals and HMF were
aggregated around the crystalline CoO particles, which acted as the
directing agents for the observed aggregated structure. Further carbonization
led to the formation of the flower-like structures of the hydrochars.
The formation of a co-precipitated CoO crystal phase was confirmed
when using Co(NO3)2 or CoCl2. When
using these different cobalt compounds in the HTC, the hydrochars
that coexisted with the CoO crystalline phase also had a flower-like
structure (Figure 3).17 It has been shown that during HTC
of carbohydrates in the presence of cobalt compounds, Co(0), Co2+, and Co3+ ions coexist.19 Regarding biological and environmental applications, such as water
purification and soil improvement, cobalt-treated hydrochars should
be additionally treated for the removal of the cobalt compounds, which
are toxic to biological systems.20

HTC has been investigated
as an approach for the synthesis of photoluminescent
particles, using catalysts as in the study of Qian et al.21 They used tellurium-based nanowires and catalyzed
the degradation of glucose and obtained fibers of hydrochars during
HTC. The thin fibers were photoluminescent in the blue-violet spectrum
and greater than 100 μm in length. By increasing the HTC temperature
from 160 to 200 °C, the diameter of the fibers increased from
60 to 140 nm. Our interpretation of the involved chemistry indicates
that tellurium forms an oxide layer in aqueous solutions, which then
acts as a catalyst. We hypothesize that TeO2 on the Te
nanowires catalyzed the polymerization of HMF, furfural, and aldehydes
into hydrochar fibers (Figure 4).

electron microscopy images of fiber-like hydrochar particles obtained

Tellurium-based compounds are toxic to the human
biological system.22 Thus, the tellurium-treated
hydrochars should
be further processed for the removal of toxic compounds.

Effect of Iron
Ions and Particles on Hydrothermal Carbonization
of Biomass
Structural and Compositional Effect of Iron Ions and Iron Oxide
Particles on the Formation of Hydrochar and Biooil
The effect
of iron particles and ions on HTC of biomass and carbohydrates has
attracted some attention. These particles and ions catalyze the formation
of hydrochar and biooil and affect the structural and morphological
features of the hydrochar. Moreover, iron is an inexpensive and abundant
element and thus a suitable additive for the mass production of hydrochars
and related materials. Hydrated Fe2+ and Fe3+ will acidify the aqueous solutions (pH 1–3). The acidity
of iron-containing solutions is due to the positive charge of iron
ions, which pulls electrons from the O–H bond of the H2O in the first coordination shell, which, in turn, increases
the tendency to release H+ to the solution. Polymerization
of hydrochars by iron catalysis may follow the Cossee–Arlman
mechanism by forming an iron complex with the organic matter.23 Acidic and hydroxyl groups from carboxylic acids
and phenols act as an electron shuttle or redox mediator and drive
the reduction pathway of (e– +
Fe3++ → Fe2+).24

Cui et al. reported in a seminal study on the effect of [Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2] and iron oxide
on HTC of starch and rice.13 The hydrochar
consisted of spherical particles with diameters of about 2 μm
(Figure 5), and as
it has already been mentioned, spherical particles of hydrochar are
commonly observed when glucose and related carbohydrates are used
in the HTC.14

microscopy images of spherical particles
of hydrochar. Images reproduced with permission from ref (13). Copyright 2006 Wiley-VCH

Acids such as FeCl3 have also been used for the synthesis
of hydrochars in HTC since the time of Bergius.2 For example, Wang et al. reported the formation of a “dual-core
Fe2O3@carbon structure” during HTC with
water, FeCl3, and chitosan. They observed a formation of
Fe2O3 and proposed that the amine groups of
chitosan chelated with Fe3+ on the Fe2O3, and that this chelation was involved in the formation of
the iron/hydrochar structures.25 It is
unclear to us if this mechanism holds at the end of the reaction as
the primary amines of chitosan are likely decomposed during HTC.26

Applications of Iron-Containing HTC Products
in Water Treatment
Hydrochars can be used in different applications
such as catalysis,
water treatment, gas separation, etc.13,27 Iron-containing
hydrochars are specifically attractive in the removal of heavy metals
and volatile organic compounds from water because of their surface
functional groups and magnetic features. Wang et al. used what they
describe as dual-core Fe2O3@hydrochar structures
for the adsorption of Cu2+ and Cr6+ from water.
At a pH range of 2–5, the iron-oxide-containing carbon structures
adsorbed Cr6+ (the highest adsorption at pH 2) and Cu2+ (the highest adsorption at pH 5).25

The release of pharmaceuticals into urban water systems and
lakes is an emerging issue in relation to human health and the ecosystems.
Yu et al. studied the removal of various types of estrogens at a pH
range of 4–9 from water using a pyrolyzed iron/hydrochar composite.27 They pyrolyzed the hydrochar samples at 600
°C. The XPS results showed the coexistence of Fe2O3 and ferrihydrite in the iron/hydrochar composite.

Transmission
Electron Microscopy and Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy
Studies of Iron-Containing Hybrid Materials
Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) is a powerful characterization tool for
metal and metal oxides in hydrochars and related carbon-based materials.
High-resolution TEM and electron diffraction (ED) information can
be used to identify mixed phases, solve crystal structures, and map
out the nature of a complex multiphase system used in catalysts, for
example. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and mapping techniques
allow one to analyze the elemental composition of samples containing
reasonably heavy elements. With electron energy loss spectroscopy
(EELS), the spectra of the inelastically scattered electrons are recorded
and images or diffraction patterns from electrons of a specific energy
can be formed, interpreted, and quantified. EELS is well-suited to
detect light elements, which are difficult to analyze with EDX. EELS
offers more information than mere elemental identification; for example,
it can be used as a very sensitive probe for the study of the oxide-
and carbon-containing species in metal-supported carbon catalysts.
High-angle annular dark-field or scanning transmission electron microscopy
that provide atomic structure images with excellent atomic-number
sensitivity can be used to determine the precise location and identity
of individual atoms or clusters with sub-angstrom resolution in three
dimensions.

Liu et al. reported the dispersion of Fe(0) on a
hydrochar support. They first treated pinewood sawdust-derived hydrochars
with Fe(NO3)3 at room temperature. Subsequently,
the iron-impregnated hydrochars were heated at above 400 °C to
obtain a pyrolyzed Fe(0)/carbon composite.28 Apart from showing the morphology of the sample, TEM images provided
evidence that the Fe(0) particles were uniformly dispersed within
the hydrochar matrix, in which the size of the Fe(0) particles could
be measured. High-resolution TEM was applied to identify the crystalline
graphitic carbon and the amorphous carbon as shown in Figure 6.

Janbroers et al. studied
carbonized iron catalysts for Fischer–Tropsch
synthesis by in situ TEM-EELS. The carbonized iron-based catalysts
were composed of iron carbide and magnetite. The lattice spacings
were observed at high magnification and were consistent with the d-spacings of hematite.29 Fourier
transforms of the crystalline areas were performed to determine the
lattice spacing of iron oxide and iron carbide so that these two species
could be distinguished. They used the peak areas of the EELS edges
to determine the valence states of the iron species and to calculate
the iron/oxygen ratio, which is a semiquantitative way to determine
the relative degree of oxidation. By calculating the L3/L2 area ratios from the EELS data, as shown in Figure 7, the oxidation state
of the iron was determined. As a result, the L3/L2 ratios were found to be similar (5.7, 5.8, and 5.4) for the samples
and the hematite reference, which proved that the iron in all samples
was Fe(+3), which was consistent with the hematite structure. Jin
et al. also applied the EELS technique on iron catalysts for Fischer–Tropsch
synthesis and studied the Fe L2,3 edge, carbon K edge,
and oxygen K edge structure of the samples.30 The EELS analyses could clearly differentiate between amorphous
surface carbon and surface oxide films. They were therefore able to
analyze the iron carbide particles covered with a surface layer of
amorphous carbon and those with a surface layer of amorphous oxide.
On the latter particles, they analyzed the carbon K edge related to
the iron carbide phase. Using EELS, three different carbonaceous species,
amorphous and graphitic carbon on the surface of carbide particles
and carbidic carbon, were clearly identified. In their previous study,31 the reactivity of these carbonaceous species
was studied and related to the ease of hydrogenation of these carbonaceous
species. The amorphous carbon which had been formed on the surface
of the carbide particles was very reactive and could be readily hydrogenated
in a flow of H2 at room temperature, whereas the graphitic
carbon could only be hydrogenated at increased temperatures. The EELS
results were of great interest and could be correlated with the observed
reactivity of these carbonaceous species.

Conclusion
HTC
of simple sugars and certain polysaccharides can be performed
without the addition of metal ions or metal particles. However, metal
ions, metal, or metal oxide particles influence the structure and
composition of the hydrochars or metal(oxide)–hydrochar hybrids
and catalytically accelerate the involved hydrothermal reactions.
In the review, we showed that the features and yields of the hydrochars
could be changed with the addition of metal ions or metal oxide particles.
In particular, we highlighted the effect of the use of iron, in various
forms, during the HTC. Iron is a low-cost element and has catalytic
and structural effects on the HTC products. In the review process,
we learned that the acidic Fe2+ and Fe3+ could
complex with HMF, furan, and aldehydes, which can further decompose
and polymerize into hydrochars. However, the mechanistic models which
have been proposed for the reaction pathway of iron-treated hydrochars
are not very well elaborated. Further studies in real time of the
chemical reactions during HTC could enhance the understandings of
the hydrothermal reaction pathways with Fe2+ and Fe3+ being present. With such pathways being resolved, it could
be more straightforward to derive iron oxide–hydrochar hybrid
materials for defined applications and further refinements.
