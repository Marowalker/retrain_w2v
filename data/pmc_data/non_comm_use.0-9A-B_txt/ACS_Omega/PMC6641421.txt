We present a deposition
technique termed evaporation-assisted deposition
(EAD). The technique is based on a coupled evaporation-to-condensation
transfer process at atmospheric conditions, where graphene oxide (GO)
is transferred to a Si wafer via the vapor flux between an evaporating
droplet and the Si surface. The EAD process is monitored with visible
and infrared cameras. GO deposits on Si are characterized by both
Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We find that
a scaled energy barrier for the condensate is required for EAD, which
corresponds to specific solution–substrate properties that
exhibit a minimized free energy barrier at the solid–liquid–vapor
interface.

1 Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) materials are of high interest for their promising
advances in photovoltaics,1 thermal and
mechanical improvements of ceramics,2 chemical
vapor sensors,3,4 and field-effect transistors.5,6 Although graphene remains as the spotlight 2D material, recent efforts
extend to exploring additional materials such as MoS2,
WS2, h-BN, and phosphorene.7−10 A key limitation for these 2D materials
is the lack of idealized large-area fabrication techniques. The simplest
technique, mechanical exfoliation, produces high-quality crystalline
films but provides extremely low yield with no scalability.11 Liquid exfoliation7,12,13 introduces selective chemical functionality14 for applications in biosensors15 or energy conversion/storage16 and introduces a wide range of deposition techniques such as spaying,12 dip-coating (including Langmuir–Blodgett),8,17,18 and spin-coating.4 Substrate dip-coating methods have a broad range of benefits;
however, the capillary flow of the liquid and solid–liquid–vapor
contact line dynamics typically produce nonuniform deposits (i.e.,
the coffee-ring effect19).

Chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) and physical vapor deposition (PVD)
currently show great promise for industrializing 2D materials and
can produce films on the order of square centimeters.20−22 Because of the need of a high-temperature environment for thermal
CVD,20,21 material deposition is limited to specific
material substrates. Therefore, additional stamping/lithography steps
are required for depositing on arbitrary substrates.21 Although PVD22 and wave plasma
CVD23 are low-temperature methods (low
relative to thermal CVD, yet still ∼400 °C), the material
deposited is still vaporized because of the high vacuum conditions
and any chemical functionality is lost. As a result, large-scale deposition of chemically derived graphene
using CVD/PVD remains constrained to post-grown functionalization
of graphene sheets.24

The current
work is a result of our efforts to find a method with
the combined versatility of chemical functionalization with liquid
exfoliated solutions14 and large-scale
uniformity via vapor deposition methods21−23—thus leading
to our discovery of material deposition at near atmospheric conditions,
which we term evaporation-assisted deposition (EAD). We achieve a
vapor-phase-assisted mass transportation of a chemically modified
graphene oxide (GO) at low temperatures (<100 °C) and atmospheric
pressure such that the GO nanoparticles remain in the solid phase
after crossing the liquid–vapor interface into the ambient
gaseous environment. With growingly popular matrix-assisted mass spectroscopy
for analyzing large nonvolatile proteins and other biomolecules,25,26 gas-/vapor-phase transportation becomes possible without fragmentation,
preserving chemical functionality.

2 Results
and Discussion
The setup used for performing an EAD is shown
in Figure 1a. A polymer
acrylic substrate
is fabricated to control the contact line dynamics of a droplet,27 and computer-controlled syringe pump maintains
the droplet of a lightly sulfonated graphene oxide dispersion (LSG)28 in steady-state evaporation.29 Briefly, the polymer substrate is heated, and the flow
rate into an evaporating droplet is controlled to maintain its volume
(and all other droplet parameters) constant over an extended period
of time. A target substrate for deposition (e.g., a Si wafer) is translated
above this evaporating droplet. The target substrate is mounted onto
a large thermal mass (heat sink) to maintain its temperature below
the effective dew point of the evaporated vapor solution, allowing
the formation of condensates. Exploiting the transparency of Si in
the infrared (IR) spectrum, an IR camera monitors the condensation
from above (Figure 1a).

Figure 1 Experimental setup and data for the proposed EAD technique. (a)
Schematic of the experimental setup for maintaining steady-state droplet
evaporation. A Si substrate is mounted on a motorized translation
stage, and an IR camera records images from above. Sample IR images
show the droplet evaporating on a heated substrate (TS = 60 °C) and condensation forming on the passing
Si substrate above. (b) Dependence of condensation rates on the translation
speed and height above the droplet. The data point at a Δz = 200 μm and a speed v⃗ =
50 μm/s is not included in the curve fitting trend (dashed lines).
(c) Scaled energy barrier (ΔPYL ×
ΔG) for various substrate–solution combinations.
EAD deposits were only detected for the solution of dispersed LSG
in water (red circles) on an ethanol-cleaned Si wafer (EtOH–Si),
which has the lowest energy barrier.

In an attempt to demonstrate the versatility in EAD, we deposited
various materials including (1) a lightly sulfonated graphene oxide
dispersion (LSG);28 (2) graphene oxide
with a NaCl additive (GO–NaCl); (3) GO30,31 at 0.5 and 0.1 wt %; and (4) lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) purchased from MTI Corporation—with a variety of target
deposition substrates including (1) Si wafers sonicated in ethanol
(EtOH–Si); (2) Si wafers with 500 nm of thermally grown SiO2; (3) acrylic polymer substrates (the same on which the droplet
is evaporating); (4) fused silica substrates coated with 80 nm of
Al; and (5) Si wafers chemically etched with hydrofluoric acid (HF-etched
Si).32 To test the applicability of the
EAD method with other materials, additional EAD experiments were also
conducted with organic droplet dispersions of MoS2. However,
no additional data for MoS2 are provided because we did
not successfully deposit MoS2 via the EAD method and these
MoS2 samples were not aqueous dispersions like the other
samples studied (see Figure 1c).

Figure 1c plots
a scaled energy barrier for each key substrate–solution combination
listed, where this energy barrier is calculated as the Laplace pressure
multiplied by the free energy of the solid surface. The Laplace pressure
scales with the sine of the equilibrium contact angle ,29 and the free
energy of a film covered by the solid substrate surface scales as
ΔG ∝ (cos θa –
cos θr),33 where θE, θa, and θr correspond
to the equilibrium, advancing, and receding contact angles, respectively.
The scaled energy barrier, ΔPYL ×
ΔG = sin θe × (cos θa – cos θr), is formulated by considering
both a driving mechanism to cross the liquid–vapor
interface (Laplace pressure component) and a substrate-capturing
mechanism (free energy of a solid surface, ΔG). Figure 1c reveals that the LSG/EtOH–Si (solution–substrate)
combination has the lowest energy barrier, which is sufficiently low
to allow a vapor-phase transfer of the GO and LSG particles from the
evaporating droplet dispersion to the deposition substrate. The ability
to deposit with other solution–substrate combinations is inhibited
by either an unfavorable driving mechanism or substrate-capturing
mechanism, as expressed by the larger scaled energy barrier. Additionally,
this scaled energy barrier estimation will pose issues when considering
superhydrophobic surfaces (sin θE → 0). Correspondingly,
the estimated energy barrier for the HF-etched Si (θE ≈ 110°) provided in Figure 1c provides a lower estimate compared to the
other substrates with θE ≲ 90°. Additional
information on the nanomaterial dispersions/suspensions, substrates,
and contact angle measurements is provided in the Supporting Information. It was initially presumed that application
of additional external forces (e.g., electric or magnetic fields)
can lower the energy barrier enough to achieve deposition with other
nanomaterials which would otherwise have an energy barrier insurmountable
with the setup used in Figure 1a (e.g., LiCoO2/EtOH combination with the second
lowest scaled energy barrier). However, our initial studies using
various magnetic field setups were unsuccessful unless there was a
coexistence of dropwise condensation on the deposition substrate,
indicating that EAD requires the coupled evaporation–condensation
transfer process.

For all experiments, the polymer acrylic substrate
is heated to TS = 60 ± 0.6 °C.
The substrate is
fabricated27 to maintain the droplet dispersion
of LSG at a constant contact radius of Rc ≅ 925 μm and a contact angle of θ ≅ 105
± 5°. An infuse rate of ṁ = 9.8
± 0.6 nL/s is also used to maintain steady-state evaporation
at a constant volume.29 For all experiments,
the droplet evaporation rate is held constant (i.e., keeping Rc, θ, and TS fixed29) and therefore condensation rates
on the Si substrate are mainly dictated by the translational speed
(v⃗) and separation distance (Δz) of the Si relative to the evaporating droplet dispersion
(Figure 1b). Figure 2a–c shows
the deposits of LSG by an EAD experiment conducted at slow translation
speeds (v⃗ ≈ 50 μm/s) and small
Si/droplet separations (Δz ≈ 150 μm).
The resulting high condensation rate (Figure 1c) led to significant droplet coalescence,
forming droplets of up to ∼15 nL. Rapid successive passes over
the evaporating LSG droplet increase the amount transferred to the
Si substrate (Figure 2b). Consequently, the formation of large condensates led to aggregation
and the expected nonuniform capillary-induced deposits.19 Also, EAD experiments at separations less than
∼100 μm frequently led to liquid bridging between the
condensate and the evaporating droplet. As a result, only EAD experiments
for Δz ≳ 150 μm are provided.

Figure 2 Optical
images corresponding to the deposition of (a–c)
LSG and (d) sulfanilic acid using the proposed EAD technique. The
yellow scale bars indicate lengths of (a,b) 100, (c) 5, and (d) 10
μm. (e) Corresponding Raman spectra measured for the deposits
in (a–d), indicating the peaks expected for each material from
the literature.34 Sulfanilic acid (d) and
deionized (DI) water (not shown) deposits prove that the graphene
peaks are not from contaminants. (f) C 1s X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) spectra of (i) GO prior to the chemical conjugation with the
sulfonate group, (ii) sulfonated graphene, (iii) sulfonated graphene
on the Si wafer deposited by EAD. All spectra are deconvoluted and
fitted with peak contributions from sp2 and sp3 carbon at 284.4 eV (C–C/C=C) and oxygen-containing
functional groups which are located at 285.7 eV (C–O), 287.8
eV (C=O), and 289.0 eV (O=C–O). It is evident
that the peak intensities of oxygen-containing functional groups have
reduced significantly in sulfonated graphene after the chemical conjugation
as compared to the GO. The spectra of sulfonated graphene (ii) and
EAD-deposited graphene (iii) show similar peak intensities, indicating
the deposition of the chemically modified GO (i.e., LSG particles).

In an effort to produce uniform
deposits, droplet coalescence can
be regulated by decreasing the overall condensation rate. Yet, decreasing
the overall condensation rate below ∼100 pL/mm2/s
(measured using the image analysis method described in the Supporting Information) with the presented setup
resulted in scarce deposits on the Si wafer. Additionally, no EAD
deposits are detected when the Si substrate is heated to avoid condensation,
irrespective of v⃗ and Δz; for example, no condensate is formed at Si wafer temperatures equal
to or greater than the evaporating droplet temperature. This, in hindsight,
is expected because just as there is an energy barrier for the GO
to leave the evaporating droplet (i.e., cross the liquid–vapor
interface), there is also an energy barrier for the GO to deposit
on the Si.

Raman spectroscopy has been reported as a quick technique
for detecting
graphene, with G-band and 2D-band peaks at ∼1580 and ∼2700
cm–1, respectively.35 The Raman spectra for EAD-deposited LSG are provided in Figure 2e. The third peak
at ∼1350 cm–1 (the D-band) arises for defected
graphene (expected because of the oxygen and sulfonic acid functionalization).
The relative intensity of the D-band varies slightly for each deposit,
which is related to the defect density.36

Null EAD experiments are performed (Figure 2d,e) to verify against false characterization
of graphene caused by detecting the deposition of possible ambient
hydrocarbons in the ambient air37 or aromatic
compounds from the GO–sulfanilic acid synthesis. EAD performed
with DI water shows no definitive Raman shift (Figure 2e), confirming that contaminants are not
introduced from the ambient air environment. EAD with a null LSG solution
(prepared by repeating the LSG synthesis28 without including GO) showed that residue deposits are visible via
these “null” EAD sulfanilic acid depositions (Figure 2d). However, the
Raman activity is weak (Figure 2e), and the peak positions (∼1450 and ∼2900–3000
cm–1) classify the deposits as an alkane.38 Thus, the main graphene peaks do not arise from
any null experiments—confirming that LSG is deposited by the
proposed EAD process.

Chemical functionalization of graphene
introduces advances to various
biological applications,15 though it tends
to have low thermal stabilities.39−41 CVD and PVD (requiring
high-temperature/high-vacuum environments) vaporize the material,
removing chemical functionality, and therefore are not viable techniques
for these technologies. The XPS spectrum (Figure 2f) confirms that the low-temperature ambient-pressure
environment with EAD preserves the chemically modified graphene functionality.
The carbon spectrum (Figure 2f(iii)) indicates asymmetry at higher binding energies due
to the oxygen functionalization. The relative intensity of the functional
groups is comparable to that of the LSG powder spectrum (Figure 2f(ii)). The lack
of a strong C–O peak for GO39 is
expected from the partial reduction of GO during the synthesis.28 Additionally, the sodium (Na) and sulfur (S)
introduced during the preparation are present in both EAD-transferred
LSG and powder (see the Supporting Information).

The vapor-phase transfer of solid LSG particles is a remarkable
result. Although our proposed EAD transfer mechanism is still debatable,
there is certainly an energy barrier that the particles must overcome
to transfer across the liquid–vapor interface of the droplet.
A theoretical investigation by Lima et al.42 shows that hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces develop double layers
of opposite sign, providing an attractive force. Coupled with the
mass transport due to evaporation, this ion-specific force between
the hydrophobic (acrylic) and hydrophilic (Si) surfaces in our setup
is hypothesized as possible contribution to the EAD transfer process.
Although, additional forces are required for different solutions or
target substrates, a relationship between the target substrate wettability
and the contact angle hysteresis33 is used
to determine the free energy for various solution–substrate
setups (see the Supporting Information).
As expected, the combination of LSG on Si has the lowest free energy
(Figure 1c). The inability
to deposit with the additional solutions–substrates is attributed
to the larger free energy barrier. Additionally, a hydrophobic target
substrate eliminates the additional attractive force42 which may be influential in the transfer mechanism. From
this, area-selective deposition is potentially viable with, for example,
textured (or micro-/nanopatterned) hydrophobic/hydrophilic targets
to facilitate favorable deposition in hydrophilic regions. Additionally,
graphene, reported to have ferromagnetic features,43 may also be transferable by EAD in the presence of a magnetic
field, although this was not systematically explored in this work.

To conclude, we present a material deposition technique utilizing
a vapor-phase transfer of solid particles. By minimizing the liquid–solid
free energy barrier with selection of a target substrate and fluid
dispersion, we show that the mass transfer due to evaporation (among
other possible forces such as an ion-specific attractive force) can
exceed this energy barrier to transfer solid materials into the vapor
phase. The additional energy barrier to deposit the material onto
the target substrate against gravitational forces and replace the
absorbed air molecules with GO is overcome by condensing the vapor.
By avoiding the vaporization of the material (remaining as a solid),
the material has also been shown to maintain its chemical functionality.
Although we were not able to show that our proposed EAD technique
is ubiquitous to all droplet dispersions of 2D materials, EAD still
exhibits the potential for low-temperature deposition of 2D materials
at atmospheric pressures.
