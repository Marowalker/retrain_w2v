Two novel 23-fluorinated 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 analogues were
synthesized using Inhoffen–Lythgoe diol as a precursor of the
CD-ring, efficiently. Introduction of the C23 fluoro group was achieved
by the deoxy-fluorination reaction using N,N-diethylaminosulfur trifluoride or 2-pyridinesulfonyl fluoride
(PyFluor). Kinetic studies on the CYP24A1-dependent metabolism of
these two analogues revealed that (23S)-23-fluoro-25-hydroxyvitamin
D3 was more resistant to CYP24A1-dependent metabolism than
its 23R isomer.

==== Body
Introduction
It is well known that
human CYP24A1 plays an important role in
the specific metabolism of 25-hydroxylated vitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] consisting of the 23-position and 24-position hydroxylation
pathways that degrade the side chain (Scheme 1).1 The 3-step
oxidation after the C23 hydroxylation of 25(OH)D3 leads
to the production of 25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone. On the other
hand, the 24-hydroxylation pathway of 25(OH)D3 produces
calcitroic acid.2

Scheme 1 Metabolic Pathways
of 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] by Human
CYP24A11
To increase the chemical or metabolic stability against
CYP24A1,
fluorine-substituted vitamin D3 analogues have been actively
synthesized.3−7 For example, falecalcitriol (1) has longer duration
of action in vivo, and it was approved for the treatment of secondary
hyperparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism in Japan. Therefore, we
focused on the importance of the fluorinated vitamin D3 analogues and demonstrated an efficient synthetic methodology to
introduce fluorine atoms to the side chain of vitamin D3.8 On the 25(OH)D3 side chain,
the C23 position is one of the important catabolic sites of CYP24A1.
However, to the best of our knowledge, only a few C23-fluorinated
vitamin D3 analogues have been synthesized thus far. The
first report on C23-fluorinated vitamin D3 analogues was
the synthesis of 23,23-difluoro-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [23,23-F2-25(OH)D3 (2)] published by Kobayashi’s
group in 1984.9 After that, Ikeda and colleagues
reported (23R)-23,26,26,26,27,27,27-heptafluoro-1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3 [(23R)-23,26,26,26,27,27,27-F7-1α,25(OH)2D3] (3) and its
23S isomer [(23S)-23,26,26,26,27,27,27-F7-1α,25(OH)2D3] (4) in 2000.10 We have developed a novel
practical approach to (23R)-23-fluoro-25-hydroxyvitamin
D3 [(23R)-23-F-25(OH)D3] (5) and its 23S isomer [(23S)-23-F-25(OH)D3] (6) (Figure 1), and clarified their biological activity,
especially CYP24A1 metabolic resistance.

Figure 1 Structures of vitamin
D3 analogues with the fluorinated
side chain 1–4 and the new analogues 5 and 6. Falecalcitriol (1), 23,23-F2-25(OH)D3 (2), (23R)-23,26,26,26,27,27,27-F7-1α,25(OH)2D3 (3), and (23S)-23,26,26,26,27,27,27-F7-1α,25(OH)2D3 (4),
(23R)-23-F-25(OH)D3 (5),
and (23S)-23-F-25(OH)D3 (6).

Results and Discussion
The synthetic
plan for analogues (5,6) is described in Scheme 2. Stereoselective
introduction of the fluorine atom would
be performed by deoxy-fluorination using N,N-diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST) or 2-pyridinesulfonyl
fluoride (PyFluor). Triene structures would be constructed by the
Wittig–Horner coupling reaction between the CD-ring precursors
(7,8) and the lithium salt of the A-ring
anion from phosphine oxide 9.11

Scheme 2 Retrosynthetic Analysis of 23-Fluoro-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (5 and 6)
The synthesis of CD-ring precursors 7 and 8 using PyFluor is shown in Scheme 3 (method A). The aldehyde 10 was synthesized
in 4 steps by the established method from Inhoffen–Lythgoe
diol.12 Introduction of the hydroxy group
to C23 was accomplished by the aldol reaction with ethyl acetate,
and the 25-hydroxy group was consequently constructed by Grignard
reaction to provide diols 11 and 12.1 These two alcohols were separated by silica-gel
column chromatography. Stereoselective deoxy-fluorination to the secondary
hydroxy group (23-OH) of 11 and 12 was successfully
performed by PyFluor to give 13 (from 12) and 14 (from 11) in moderate yields,
without interfering with the tertiary hydroxy group (25-OH).13 Deprotection of the TES group gave alcohols 15 and 16. Tetrapropylammonium perruthenate (TPAP)
oxidation followed by trimethylsilylation of the 25-OH group gave
ketones 7 and 8, respectively.

Scheme 3 Synthesis
of CD-ring Precursors (7 and 8) Using PyFluor
(Method A)
Next, we tried to
improve the yield of the deoxy-fluorination step
in Scheme 4 (method
B). As we mentioned above, the yield of stereoselective deoxy-fluorination
using PyFluor was relatively low, especially in the case of 23S,25-diol (12). As shown in Scheme 4, another synthetic route to
improve the yield of the CD-ring precursor (15) was developed.
The synthetic intermediate in Scheme 3, aldehyde 10, was reacted with 2-methylallylmagnesium
chloride to give a diastereomeric mixture of homoallylic alcohols 17 and 18.1 Diastereomers 17 and 18 were separated by silica gel column
chromatography, and 17 was treated with mCPBA to give
epoxide 19. Then, 19 was applied to stereoselective
deoxy-fluorination using DAST. The reaction time became shorter and
the yield of the desired fluorinated epoxied 20 was improved.
Reductive opening of the epoxide progressed using LiAlH4, and subsequent desilylaiton provided 15.

Scheme 4 Alternative
Synthetic Route for (23R)-23-Fluorinated
CD-ring Precursor 15 (Method B)
The coupling reactions of 7 and 8 with
carbanion of the A-ring precursor 9 and subsequent deprotection
of the silyl ether group resulted in (23R)-23-F-25(OH)D3 (5) and (23S)-23-F-25(OH)D3 (6) in 68 and 43% yields, respectively (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Wittig–Horner
Reaction, and Deprotection Steps for 5 and 6
Metabolic studies of 5 and 6 were performed
using a reconstituted system containing recombinant human CYP24A1.
The metabolites of each analogue were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC,
and their kinetic parameters were estimated (Table 1).

Table 1 Kinetic Parameters
of Human CYP24A1
for 25(OH)D3 and Its Two Analogues
substrate	kcat (min–1)	Km (μM)	kcat/Km	
25(OH)D3	15.3 ± 4.5	0.76 ± 0.21	20.1	
(23R)-23-F-25(OH)D3	7.8 ± 2.1	0.39 ± 0.13	20.0	
(23S)-23-F-25(OH)D3	2.1 ± 0.5	0.38 ± 0.13	5.5	
The kcat/Km value of CYP24A1 for (23R)-23-F-25(OH)D3 (5) was similar to that for
25(OH)D3, whereas
that for (23S)-23-F-25(OH)D3 (6) was approximately 4 times lower than that for 25(OH)D3. These results suggested that (23S)-23-F-25(OH)D3 (6) is more resistant to CYP24A1-dependent metabolism
than both 25(OH)D3 and (23R)-23-F-25(OH)D3 (5).

Conclusions
A new method to synthesize
23-fluorinated vitamin D3 analogues was developed. Introduction
of a fluorine atom to the
C23-position was accomplished by deoxy-fluorination using PyFluor
or DAST in a stereoselective manner. We presented two synthetic routes
to construct CD-ring precursors (7 and 8), and the subsequent Wittig–Horner reaction with A-ring (9) produced the target compounds (5 and 6). The CD-ring precursors (7 and 8) may aid in the preparation of new 23-fluorinated vitamin D3 analogues. Kinetic studies on the metabolism of 5 and 6 revealed that the stereochemistry at the C23-F
position significantly affects the resistance to human CYP24A1. These
results suggest that 5 may have more potent biological
effects than 25(OH)D3.

0.48 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (4 mL) at 0 °C, and
the mixture was stirred for 15 min. Additional TMSCl (31.3 mg, 36
μL, 0.29 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture, and it was
stirred for 10 min. To quench the reaction, water was added at 0 °C,
and the mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2 three
times. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. Purification of the residue
by flash column chromatography (hexane/ethyl acetate = 5:1) gave 8 (28.7 mg, 74%, 2 steps) as a colorless oil.

Metabolism of 25(OH)D3 and Its
Analogues by Human
CYP24A1
The metabolism of 25(OH)D3 and its analogues 5 and 6 by CYP24A1 were analyzed using the membrane
fraction prepared from recombinant Escherichia coli cells expressing human CYP24A1 as described in our previous study.14 Briefly, the reaction mixture containing 0.02
μM human CYP24A1, 2.0 μM adrenodoxin (ADX), 0.2 μM
NADPH–adrenodoxin reductase (ADR), 0.2–6.0 μM
each substrate, 1.0 mM NADPH, 100 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), and
1 mM EDTA was incubated at 37 °C for 1–10 min. The metabolites
were extracted with 4 volumes of CHCl3–CH3OH (3:1) and analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC under the following
conditions: column, CAPCELL PAK C18 UG120 (5 μm) (4.6 mm ×
250 mm) (SHISEIDO, Tokyo, Japan); UV detection, 265 nm; flow rate,
1.0 mL/min; column temperature, 40 °C; mobile phase, CH3CN: a linear gradient of 20–100% CH3CN aqueous
solution per 25 min and 100% CH3CN for 10 min. Kinetic
parameters, Km and kcat were calculated by the nonlinear regression analysis using
KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). The equation was applied
for Michaelis–Menten kinetics.
