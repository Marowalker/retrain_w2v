Nanomaterials with antimicrobial
properties triggered by external stimuli appear to be a promising
and innovative substitute for the destruction of antibiotic-resistant
superbugs as they can induce multiple disruptions in the cellular
mechanism. This study demonstrates the use of squaraine (SQ) dye as
the photosensitive material, activated in the near-infrared tissue-transparent
therapeutic window. The dye has been covalently attached to the ZnO
nanoparticle surface, forming ZnO-SQ nanohybrids. The formation of
the nanohybrids is confirmed using Fourier transform infrared and
other optical spectroscopic methods. The photoinduced interfacial
electron transfer process (as confirmed using the time-resolved fluorescence
technique) from the excited state of SQ to the conduction band of
ZnO is responsible for the greater reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation
ability of the nanohybrid. The production of photoactivated ROS (especially
singlet oxygen species) by ZnO-SQ provides remarkable antimicrobial
action against clinically significant Staphylococcus
aureus. Detailed investigations suggest synergistic
involvement of cell membrane disruption and nanoparticle internalization
followed by photoinduced intracellular ROS generation, which result
in an unprecedented 95% bacterial killing activity by the nanohybrid.
Moreover, the efficacy of the nanohybrid for disruption of bacterial
biofilms has been examined. The electron microscopic images suggest
significant bacterial cell death following structural alteration and
reduced adherence property of the biofilms. Nanodimension-driven greater
internalization of ZnO-SQ followed by an improved dissolution of ZnO
in an acidic environment of the biofilm as well as red-light-driven
interfacial charge separation and ROS generation improves the efficacy
of the material for biofilm destruction. An artificial medical implant
mimicking titanium sheets coated with ZnO-SQ depicts light-triggered
disruption in the adherence property of matured biofilms. The cytotoxicity
and hemolysis assays show inherent biocompatibility of the photoactive
nanohybrid. This study is notably promising for the treatment of life-threatening
drug-resistant infections and eradication of biofilms formed within
artificial implants.

1 Introduction
The
utilization of nanomaterials for various biomedical aspects
such as biosensors, drug delivery, theranostics, and diagnosis is
currently undergoing a dramatic expansion.1 Nanomaterials, due to their dimension-driven extraordinary physical
and chemical properties, have appeared as a potential platform either
being a delivery vehicle to transport drugs at the diseased site or
as an active therapeutic agent.2 However,
the potential toxicity of nanomaterials upon long-term exposure is
questionable and such treatments would be applied selectively for
inhibiting the affected tissues while leaving the surrounding host
cells healthy and intact.3 This requires
the nanoparticles (NPs) to be activated in the specific target organism.4 Target specificity often depends on specific
environmental signals such as temperature, pH, redox properties, enzymatic
metabolism, etc., which could be regulated through the application
of external stimuli such as chemical stimuli (pH) or physical stimuli
(light).5,6 Hence, development of stimuli-responsive
nanomaterials is high on demand because of their multipurpose and
highly efficacious implementations.7−9

Light-mediated
treatment, namely, photodynamic therapy (PDT),10 involves photosensitizers, which could be activated
by photon energy followed by production of light-activated redox species
and/or reactive oxygen species (ROS) for therapeutic use. The spatial
and temporal localization using light sources provides prevention
to potential side effects of the therapies. Moreover, the investigation
of the therapeutic efficacy of photoactive drugs using near-infrared
light can provide new ways for using the biological window of optical
transparency.11 This often suggests implication
of a NIR-absorbing dye molecule or nanomaterials as a photosensitizer
in PDT, which in turn improves the penetration potency of the light
used.12,13 There are plenty of reports on multifunctional
NIR agents for cancer targeting and imaging applications showing great
potential for clinical use.14

The
emergence of pathogenic bacteria with acquired multidrug resistance
indicates the dawn of a postantibiotic era, an alarming crisis worldwide.15,16 A recent report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
indicates that each year at least two million people suffer from bacterial
infections that are resistant to antibiotics in the United States
alone.17 Different nanomaterials, such
as silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs), depict unprecedented antimicrobial
activities and are often consider as nanoantibiotics (nAbts), a term
that has been coined for the nanomaterials that show direct antimicrobial
activity or improve the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic administration.18 nAbts are advantageous because of their sustained
release and uniform distribution in the target tissue following enhanced
cellular internalization, which minimize the possible side effects
and patient compliance.19 However, to minimize
the possible side effects and complications introduced by nAbts, stimuli
responsiveness is necessary.20 In this
regard, antimicrobial
PDT (APDT) using nanomaterials shows huge potential.

Moreover,
healthcare-associated infections comprising medical device-related
catheter-associated urinary tract infections, lower respiratory tract
infections, and surgical-site infections are often related to Gram-positive
bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and
their virulent biofilms.21 Biofilms are
dynamic communities of immobile bacteria encapsulated within a protective
matrix of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, developing
a compact structure commonly attached to a surface or to each other.22 The challenges in eradication of biofilms are
presumably due to the existence of the extracellular polymeric substances,
which prevent the penetration of small-molecule therapeutics into
biofilms.23,24 This often suggests the desperate need for
innovative nanotherapeutics.25 The eradication
of bacterial biofilms can be achieved through nanomaterial coating
on implant surfaces.26 The systematic interactions
of the biofilms with nanomaterials through efficient uptake and accumulation
of antimicrobial agents into the biofilm network provide an enhanced
therapeutic efficacy.23

The intrinsic
acidic microenvironments of biofilms, chronic infections,
or wounds (pH values 4–7) could be exploited to fabricate pH-sensitive
nanotherapeutics.27 The superior dissolution
of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) at lower pH inducted its use
as nanocarriers for drug delivery application.28 ZnO NPs also depict greater biocompatibility than that
of other metal oxide NPs with size-dependent antimicrobial property.29 Despite the promising prospect of ZnO NPs as
drug delivery vehicles due to their low cost and lesser cytotoxicity,
the wide-band-gap (∼3.3 eV) semiconducting nature suggests
its activation only by UV light (λ ∼ 375 nm), which eventually
restricts its clinical applications.30 Inorganic
metal oxide NPs conjugated with organic photosensitizers form a new
class of nanohybrids showing superior activity than that of the individual
counterparts.31 The reports indicating
the use of ZnO and visible-light-active photosensitizers (protoporphyrin,
blue-light-active and rose bengal, green-light-active) and indicating
enhanced ROS generation have previously been published by our group.30 However, to utilize the biologically transparent
NIR range absorption for efficient PDT, we employed here a red-light-active
dye squaraine (SQ2) as the active photosensitizer.

The present
study depicts the use of red-light-absorbing dye squaraine
(SQ) as the photosensitizer for APDT. The dye molecule has been conjugated
to the ZnO NP surface, which has been confirmed using optical and
vibrational (Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)) spectroscopy tools.
The nanohybrids employ both the stimuli-responsive nature and acidic
pH sensitivity due to ZnO and NIR light sensitivity due to the SQ
dye. The molecular-level interaction between two moieties initiates
the photoinduced excited-state electron transfer process from dye
to ZnO, which indeed improves the ROS generation capability. The improvement
of in vitro activity facilitates the dose-dependent killing of Gram-positive
bacteria (S. aureus) through cell membrane
rupture and cellular internalization. We have also employed the ZnO-SQ
nanohybrid for eradication of biofilms. The crystal violet (CV) assay
was performed to analyze the antibiofilm activity. We have further
used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to observe the structural
alteration of the biofilm upon photodynamic treatment. The material
is eventually coated over titanium sheets (used as mimic implants32), and their antibiofilm activity has been evaluated.
The nanohybrids also depict low toxicity to human cells and maintain
high hemocompatibility.

2 Results and Discussion
The structure of the asymmetric squaraine (SQ) dye is depicted
in Figure 1a. Figure 1b depicts the high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of ZnO NPs. The lattice
fringes of ZnO NPs show an interplanar distance of 0.27 nm, which
corresponds to the (002) crystal planes. The overall size distribution
of ZnO NPs is shown in the inset of Figure 1b. The average particle dimension is found
to be ∼24 nm. To confirm the conjugation of SQ to ZnO NP surfaces,
the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) technique has been used. The
free SQ possesses stretching frequencies at 1486 cm–1, which is attributed to the C=C stretching in the four-membered
ring,33 and at 1700 cm–1, the typical peak for the C=O stretching of an aromatic carboxylic
group (Figure 1c).
This latter signal clearly disappears in the ZnO-SQ conjugated system,
keeping other signals unaltered, suggesting that SQ is attached to
the semiconductor surface through the peripheral COOH binding of SQ
to ZnO. The conjugation between SQ and ZnO NPs can also be understood
by UV–vis spectroscopy (Figure 1d). The absorption spectra of SQ in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) show a noticeable peak at 665 nm, which corresponds to the
π–π* charge-transfer process with a minor peak
at 615 nm of dye aggregation.34 The characteristic
peaks of both SQ and ZnO are observed in the ZnO-SQ nanohybrids, which
indicate the successful complexation between the two moieties. The
steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of SQ and ZnO-SQ in DMSO
are shown in Figure 2a, and the corresponding excitation spectra are presented in the
inset of Figure 2a.
SQ exhibits emission maxima at 673 nm upon excitation at 633 nm. The
emission intensity is significantly reduced after attachment of SQ
to the ZnO NPs. These results imply the presence of nonradiative decay
processes from SQ to ZnO NPs. The excitation spectra depict two peaks
for SQ, which are similar to the corresponding absorption spectra.
The ZnO-SQ nanohybrid shows 5 nm bathochromic shift in the excitation
spectra, indicating molecular-level interaction during the attachment
process. To further study the electronic interactions, time-resolved
fluorescence transient studies have been carried out.35 The lower-density sp orbital of Zn2+ in ZnO
interacts with lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of dye (SQ), suggesting
an ultrafast sub-picosecond time scale due to the electron injection
process.36 The fluorescence decay transients
for free SQ and ZnO-SQ have been collected upon excitation at 633
nm and detected at 670 nm (Figure 2b) using DMSO as the solvent. The decay constants for
the excited-state decay profiles of SQ in DMSO show single exponential
decay, with a lifetime of 580 ps. A very fast time component of 30
ps generates after attachment of SQ on ZnO surfaces, suggesting a
photoinduced electron transfer process from the excited state of SQ
(dye) to the conduction band of ZnO NPs (semiconductor surface). The
details of the fitting parameter of the fluorescence decays are provided
in Table 1. As the
ZnO NPs used in the present study have not shown any intrinsic defect
state emission property, there is no chance of energy transfer process
associated with the faster time scale present in the nanohybrids. Scheme S1 depicts the band energy gap diagram
and charge distribution at the ZnO-SQ interface.

The efficient electron transfer process present in ZnO-SQ motivates
us to investigate the photoinduced ROS generation capability of the
nanohybrid. The ROS production ability of the sample has been evaluated
using the DCFH assay in which the oxidation of DCFH (nonfluorescent)
to dichlorofluorescein (DCF, fluorescent) through interaction with
ROS is monitored.37 The fluorescence emission
intensity of DCF is recorded with respect to (wrt) time (Figure 3a). The highest enhancement
of the fluorescence intensity of DCF is obtained for ZnO-SQ nanohybrids
under red light irradiation. ROS production increases three times
compared to that with free dye SQ. The control experiments with DCFH and ZnO under
red light irradiation show negligible increase in fluorescence intensity.
This confirms the involvement of photoinduced interfacial charge transfer
dynamics in ZnO-SQ for enhancement of ROS production. However, the
DCFH assay is incompetent for the determination of specific nature
of ROS. To confirm whether the generated ROS is singlet oxygen or
not, we have performed the singlet oxygen sensor green reagent (SOSGR)
assay.38 This also involves monitoring
of the emission intensity at 525 nm with progressing time. Figure 3b depicts a significant
increase in the fluorescence intensity of SOSGR when exposed to ZnO-SQ
under red light illumination. Furthermore, a quencher (NaN3) and an enhancer (D2O) of singlet oxygen species are
added with SOSGR and ZnO-SQ under red light illumination. In the case
of D2O, the fluorescence intensity increases many fold,
whereas for NaN3, it reduces significantly (Figure 3c). These results indeed confirm
the generation of red-light-induced singlet oxygen by ZnO-SQ and signify
its importance as a potential photodynamic agent for therapeutic action.

blue line shows the fluorescence response of SOSGR in the presence

The ZnO-SQ nanohybrid was evaluated
for its antimicrobial activity
as a potential photodynamic agent for the inhibition of growth of S. aureus. The effect various concentrations (0–350
nM) of the sample on S. aureus growth
has been examined using the colony-forming unit (CFU) assay under
dark conditions (Figure 4a). The inhibition in bacterial growth was significant at a concentration
of ∼200 nM, suggesting the use of lower concentration for determining
the photodynamic action. We have employed 140 nM sample and incubated
the bacterial culture for 3 h in the dark for cellular uptake of the
drug followed by 30 min red light illumination. The pictures of S. aureus cultures (inset in Figure 4b) treated with the sample in the absence
and presence of red light depict the visible change in bacterial growth
after photodynamic treatment, with significantly less number of colonies.
In control and ZnO-treated samples, no antibacterial activity under
dark and light-irradiated conditions is observed. For SQ-treated samples,
the bacterial growth is decreased up to 45% under light irradiation.
The highest inhibition of bacterial growth is obtained for ZnO-SQ-treated
samples with a 95% decrease in CFU after illumination (Figure 4b). To elucidate the mechanism
behind the enormous photodynamic killing efficiency of ZnO-SQ, we
first evaluate its photoinduced bacterial membrane distortion capacity.
The bacterial cultures without sample treatment (under dark and with
red light irradiation) and treated with ZnO-SQ (under dark and with
red light irradiation) were stained with propidium iodide (PI) to
check bacterial membrane integrity (Figure S1). PI penetrates only into cells with damaged membranes, which will
enhance the fluorescence.39 As shown in Figure 4c, red fluorescence
was observed only from bacterial cells treated with ZnO-SQ followed
by red light illumination, indicating membrane disruption due to photodynamic
action of ZnO-SQ. Furthermore, we have evaluated the capability of
ZnO-SQ to modulate the intracellular ROS generation, which promotes
several cell death mechanisms. As shown in Figure 5a, we noted that ZnO-SQ-treated S. aureus induced about 2-fold increase in the intracellular
ROS production under red light illumination conditions compared to
that from the control group. Further extending our investigation,
we have examined the bacterial morphology and NP internalization using
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Figure 5b, S. aureus exhibits typical membrane structures. The morphology and membrane
integrity of the bacteria dramatically altered after photodynamic
treatment with ZnO-SQ (Figure 5c). The NPs randomly adsorbed on bacteria, inducing noticeable
changes in membrane morphologies. Significantly, the multilayered
peptidoglycan coating of Gram-positive bacteria enhances the nanoparticle–biofilm
interactions, leading to NP penetration. ZnO NPs are already shown
to disturb lipids and proteins of the cell membrane, which results
in bacterial cell death (Scheme S2).40 The HRTEM image (shown in Figure 5d) at the cell membrane depicts internalization
of highly crystalline ∼10 nm ZnO NPs into the bacterial cell.
The overall distribution of the NPs consisting of ∼10 nm grain
boundary in the cytoplasmic area clearly confirms cellular trafficking
of the bigger NPs and embodiment of smaller NPs within the bacteria,
which are responsible for drug delivery and photoinduced intracellular
ROS generation following cell death. The diverse cell death mechanism
owing to photodynamic therapy by ZnO-SQ is pictorially depicted in Figure 5e.

The diverse cell death mechanism leading to an
exceptional stimuli-responsive
antimicrobial efficacy drives us to investigate the ability of ZnO-SQ
to disrupt biofilm formation in a red-light-activated process. The
adhered biomass of 48 h grown biofilms shows a decrease in biomass
(∼20%) for the ZnO-SQ-treated samples. The bacterial biomass
could be further reduced to ∼55% when ZnO-SQ-treated bacteria
were exposed to red light for 30 min (Figure 6a). The upper panel of Figure 6a shows photographs of crystal violet stain
in the Petri plates demonstrating visible reduction of biofilm adherence
upon photodynamic treatment. The structural and morphological changes
of the biofilms were observed by taking optical microscopy and scanning
electron microscopy images. Figure 6b,c depicts the structure of the S.
aureus biofilm without any treatment and with the
ZnO-SQ red-light treatment, respectively. The inherent colonization
property of bacterial biofilms is significantly perturbed upon the
treatment. Moreover, Figure 6d shows typical characteristics of S. aureus biofilms comprising extracellular polymeric matrix, and Figure 6e shows biofilms
treated with ZnO-SQ followed by red light irradiation, which contain
significantly fewer bacteria without the typical arrangement of a
biofilm. Upon treatment, both the adherence property and the characteristic
morphology of the biofilm were completely destroyed. The antibiofilm
activity of ZnO-SQ suggests that acidic-pH-responsive delivery vehicle
ZnO (Figure S2) acts as a permeation enhancer,
followed by a synergistic mechanism of internalization of NPs within
biofilms and generation of photoactive ROS disrupts the biofilm structures
completely. These findings suggest that ZnO-SQ should possess practical
applicability for biofilm disruption on medical implants. To unravel
the potential for clinical utilization, we have coated titanium sheets,
the model for medical implants, with ZnO-SQ samples followed by 48
h incubation with the S. aureus culture
(OD600 = 1). This generates bacterial biofilms over the
coated titanium sheets, as indicated in Figure 7a, upper panel. The remarkable crystal violet
staining over the coated titanium sheet demonstrates the presence
of proliferating biofilms. However, as the sheet was illuminated under
red light for 1 h, there is a significant reduction in crystal violet
staining, suggesting disruption of biofilms due to photoinduced ROS
generation by ZnO-SQ. This signifies the stimuli-responsive targeted
photodynamic killing and disruption efficacy of bacterial biofilms
by ZnO-SQ, suggesting future clinical prospect.

red light illumination. (c) Hemolysis assay of ZnO-SQ at different
concentrations under dark conditions.

Nevertheless, the toxicity of nanomaterials toward mammalian
cells
is one of the critical points for in vivo application. For this, we
first evaluated the toxicity of the nanohybrids against human osteoblast
cell line MG-63. We have specifically chosen the bone fibroblast cells
to evaluate the cytotoxicity as microbial biofilm pathogens are the
causative agents of chronic osteomyelitis. As depicted in Figure 7b, MG-63 cells treated
with various concentrations of nanohybrids had negligible cytotoxicity
as measured using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay under both dark and red light irradiation conditions.
The cell viability upon treatment with ZnO-SQ up to 200 nM concentration
under both dark and red light illumination conditions is comparable (>95%)
to
that of the control cells (Figure 7b). The significant toxicity arises at 300 nM concentration
(30 and 40% cell death in dark and light, respectively), which is
double the concentration used for the antimicrobial assays. This result
confirms appreciable biocompatibility of ZnO-SQ nanohybrids. Moreover,
the hemolytic activity of these NPs against human red blood cells
(RBCs) was measured. As shown in Figure 7c, at variable concentrations with highest
dosing of twice the dose used for antimicrobial therapy, the NPs show
no observable hemolytic activity, demonstrating the intrinsic biocompatibility
of ZnO-SQ with human blood cells. The NPs are also biocompatible when
exposed under red light (data not shown), suggesting the stimuli-responsive
system as safe toward real-life implementation. These overall effects
suggest ZnO-SQ as a stimuli-responsive biocompatible antimicrobial
and antibiofilm agent, which demonstrates achievable clinical applications
with respect to previously reported systems.

3 Conclusions
An antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (APDT) depends on target
specificity of the drug and the penetration capability of the light
used. In the present study, we have demonstrated the use of squaraine
(SQ) as the red-light-activated photosensitizer, which can enhance
the light penetration ability through tissue. SQ was successfully
conjugated with ZnO NPs (∼24 nm, confirmed by TEM) to impart
pH sensitivity followed by nanodimension-driven drug internalization.
The attachment was confirmed using FTIR, UV–vis, steady-state
fluorescence spectroscopy tools. The photoinduced excited-state electron
transfer process from the dye to semiconductor was validated by time-resolved
fluorescence transients, and this process leads to a greater extent
of ROS generation. The ROS generated by ZnO-SQ is essentially singlet
oxygen in nature as confirmed using the SOSGR assay. The photodynamic
antibacterial effect on S. aureus was
confirmed using the CFU assay, which suggests reduction of 95% CFU after light-activated
drug treatment. The immense bacterial killing activity generated due
to cell membrane disruption was confirmed by the PI staining fluorescence
microscopy-based assay, and cellular internalization of
NPs was demonstrated using TEM and intracellular ROS generation. The
tremendous stimuli-responsive effectiveness of ZnO-SQ for killing
bacteria drew our attention to check its efficacy to eradicate bacterial
biofilms. The quantitative crystal violet assay depicted photoactivated
antibiofilm effect of the nanohybrids. The loss of adherence property
in biofilms as well as the structural disruption was confirmed using
microscopic images. The ZnO-SQ nanohybrid was coated over titanium
metal sheets, used as artificial implant mimic, and was demonstrated
to eradicate mature biofilms by application of external red illumination.
The cytotoxicity assay using human bone cell line MG-63 and the hemolysis
assay on human RBCs show intrinsic biocompatibility of ZnO-SQ, suggesting
its overall clinical applicability. Hence, this enquiry could be translated
to develop penetrable light-activated nanoantibiotic agents to treat
antibiotic-resistant clinically isolated pathogens.

4 Experimental Details
Analytical-grade reagents were utilized
for the synthesis without
further purification. ZnO NPs were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. X-ray
fluorescence analysis suggests >97 wt % zinc, and the particle
size
is <50 nm, as confirmed by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller.41 The squaraine dye (sensidizer SQ2) was purchased
from Solaronix. The suitable solvent used for preparing the dye solution
was DMSO (Merck). Millipore water was used to prepare the aqueous
solution. Titanium foils (Sigma-Aldrich) of 1 cm × 1 cm dimensions
were used as mimic implants.

4.1 Preparation of SQ-Sensitized
ZnO Nanohybrids
The nanohybrids were prepared using overnight
incubation of 0.5
mM SQ with ZnO NPs under dark conditions. After the sensitization
process, the solution was centrifuged and washed with DMSO four times
to separate any unattached dye. The nanohybrid was then dried in an
oven and stored in the dark until further use.

4.2 Characterization
Techniques
Diluted
solutions of ZnO NPs were spread over carbon-coated copper grids for
TEM analysis. The particle sizes were determined from micrographs
using an FEI (Technai S-Twin, operating at 200 kV) instrument at a
magnification of 100 000×. The FTIR spectra were recorded
on a JASCO FTIR-6300 spectrometer. A Shimadzu spectrophotometer (UV-2600)
was used for measuring absorption, and a HORIBA Fluorolog was employed
to measure steady-state emission. Time-resolved photoluminescence
measurements were carried out through a time-correlated single-photon
counting setup from Edinburgh Instruments. The measured instrument
response function was 60 ps, and excitation at 633 nm was used while
emission was detected at 670 nm. The fitting of the fluorescence transients
was done using a nonlinear least-squares procedure, as reported in
our previous publications.42−44 For all light-activated experiments,
a red light-emitting diode (LED) source (λmax = 640
nm and power = 3 mW/cm2) was used.

4.3 In Vitro
Measurement of ROS
DCFH
was prepared from dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA; Calbiochem)
using the reported de-esterification reaction procedure.31 SQ (1 μM), ZnO (150 μM), and ZnO-SQ
(individual concentrations of SQ and ZnO in the nanohybrid are 1 and
150 μM, respectively) were used for the assay. To infer the
singlet oxygen generation, the singlet oxygen sensor green reagent
(SOSGR)38 from Molecular Probes was used.
Furthermore, singlet oxygen quencher NaN3 (Sigma) and enhancer
D2O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.) were employed
for confirming the formation of singlet oxygen species.45

4.4 Bacterial Strain and Culture
Conditions
The bacteriological assays were performed using
the strain S. aureus (ATCC 25923),
and details are provided
in Supporting Information (SI). The cells
were incubated with 140 nM nanohybrids (concentration is calculated
wrt SQ loading, details are provided in SI) followed by red light illumination (λmax = 640
nm) for 30 min. The photodynamic action was measured by using Luria–Bertani
(LB) agar-based colony formation assay.

4.5 Propidium
Iodide Staining Assay
S. aureus (1 × 108) cells were treated
with 140 nM nanohybrid in the dark at 37 °C and 300 rpm for 3
h. Then, bacterial solutions were divided into two parts and one part
was exposed to red light. After the treatment, samples were incubated
with 2 μM PI for 15 min in the dark. The samples (10 μL)
were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Leica digital inverted
microscopes DMI8).

4.6 Intracellular ROS Determination
To
confirm the unaltered efficacy of the nanohybrids in the presence
of common biomolecules and metal ions, i.e., more like cellular conditions,
we have assessed the intracellular ROS generation. In the assay, 10
μM DCFDA was added to the treated bacterial culture and incubated
for 30 min in the dark. The samples were then centrifuged and washed
with water. The emission intensity at 520 nm was analyzed upon 488
nm excitation.46

4.7 Internalization
of Nanohybrids into Bacterial
Cells: TEM Observations47
The
nanohybrid-treated bacterial solution was applied to a carbon-coated
Cu grid. After settlement of the solution in the grid, cells were
stained with 2 μL of 1% uranyl acetate for 1 min. It was observed
using an FEI Technai S-Twin microscope with an accelerating voltage
of 200 kV.

4.8 Development of Bacterial
Biofilms
S. aureus biofilms
were developed
in LB medium on 60 mm sterile polycarbonate Petri dishes. These cells
(1 × 109) were spread over the Petri dish and incubated
for 2 days at 37 °C.48 Crystal violet
(CV; 0.1% (w/v)) staining was used to quantify the biofilms. The CV
stain was solubilized
in 95% ethanol. The degree of biofilm formation was evaluated using
the absorbance at 595 nm (A595). The bacterial
biofilms have also been cultured over implant mimic titanium foils.
The morphological changes of the biofilms were determined using SEM
analysis (detail in SI).

4.9 Cytotoxicity Assay
The MTT assay
was used to check the biocompatibility of the ZnO-SQ nanohybrid. MG-63
cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM; HiMedia) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco)
and 1.0% penicillin/streptomycin (HiMedia) and cultured at 37 °C,
5.0% CO2, and 95% humidity.49 These cells (1.0 × 104) were seeded in each well
of a 96-well plate and cultured in 10% FBS-supplemented DMEM. The
cells were incubated with various concentrations of ZnO-SQ (0–300
nM wrt SQ) for 2 h. The media have been changed with fresh media to
remove excess particles, and cells were exposed to the red LED source for 30 min. After 24 h of incubation,
the MTT assay was performed using an MTT assay kit (CCK003, Himedia)
following the manufacture’s instruction.

4.10 Hemolysis Assay
The hemolysis assay
was performed on human RBCs. Ethylenediaminetetraacetate-stabilized
human whole blood was centrifuged five times and redispersed in 10
mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer. Then, 0.1 mL of RBC
solution was mixed with variable concentrations of nanohybrids. The
samples were incubated at 37 °C and 100 rpm for 30 min, and then
the mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min. The absorption
of the supernatant solution was measured at 570 nm. RBCs incubated
with PBS and 1% Triton X-100 were used as negative and positive controls,
respectively. All sets were prepared in triplicate. The hemolysis
percentage was calculated following the reported equation.47
