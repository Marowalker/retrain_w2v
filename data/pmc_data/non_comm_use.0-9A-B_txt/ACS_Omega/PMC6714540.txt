Signal
transducer activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is among
the most investigated oncogenic transcription factors, as it is highly
associated with cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, chemoresistance,
and immune evasion. Evidences from both preclinical and clinical studies
have demonstrated that STAT3 plays a critical role in several malignancies
associated with poor prognosis such as glioblastoma and triple-negative
breast cancer, and STAT3 inhibitors have shown efficacy in inhibiting
cancer growth and metastasis. Constitutive activation of STAT3 by
mutations occurs frequently in tumor cells and directly contributes
to many malignant phenotypes. Unfortunately, detailed structural biology
studies on STAT3 as well as target-based drug discovery efforts have
been hampered by difficulties in the expression and purification of
the full-length STAT3 and a lack of ligand-bound crystal structures.
Considering these, molecular modeling and simulations offer an attractive
strategy for the assessment of the “druggability” of
STAT3 dimers and allow investigations of reported activating and inhibiting
STAT3 mutants at the atomistic level of detail. In the present study,
we focused on the effects exerted by reported STAT3 mutations on the
protein structure, dynamics, DNA-binding, and dimerization, thus linking
structure, dynamics, energetics, and the biological function. By employing
atomistic molecular dynamics and umbrella-sampling simulations to
a series of human STAT3 dimers, which comprised wild-type protein
and four mutations, we explained the modulation of STAT3 activity
by these mutations. Counter-intuitively, our results show that the
D570K inhibitory mutation exerts its effect by enhancing rather than
weakening STAT3–DNA interactions, which interfere with the
DNA release by the protein dimer and thus inhibit STAT3 function as
a transcription factor. We mapped the binding site and characterized
the binding mode of a clinical candidate napabucasin/BBI-608 at STAT3,
which resembles the effect of a D570K mutation. Our results contribute
to understanding the activation/inhibition mechanism of STAT3, to
explain the molecular mechanism of STAT3 inhibition by BBI-608. Alongside
the characterization of the BBI-608 binding mode, we also discovered
a novel binding site amenable to bind small-molecule ligands, which
may pave the way to design novel STAT3 inhibitors and to suggest new
strategies for pharmacological interventions to combat cancers associated
with poor prognosis.

Introduction
Signal
transducer activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) protein
has emerged as a prominent target in tumor progression due to its
pivotal role in cell signaling.1 The activation
of the STAT3 protein has been also related to drug resistance,2 to the expression of other anti-apoptotic proteins,3 and to the inflammatory processes in tumor development,
among others.4−6 Despite its importance in cancer progression, the
pharmacological drugging of STAT3 is still a challenge that demands
clarification. Its tendency to aggregate is a major hurdle that prevents
the determination of the structure in both monomeric and dimeric forms
as well as bound to small-molecule inhibitors.7−9 Although many
strategies have been described in the literature to inhibit STAT3,
only a few inhibitors are still going through clinical trials (e.g.,
TTI-101 [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03195699] or napabucasin
(BBI-608)10−12 [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03647839]), and
STAT3 has become one of the most challenging cancer-related proteins
to target by small molecules.

Gaining insights into the atomistic-level
characteristics of STAT3
would permit the identification of novel strategies to interact with
this protein by small molecules and target oncogenic pathways indirectly.
The human STAT3 monomer is composed of six highly specialized domains
(i.e., N-terminal, coiled-coil domain, DNA-binding domain, linker
domain, SH2 domain, and C-terminal transactivation domain). Particularly,
the DNA-binding domain (residues: 320–494) is responsible for
the DNA-binding when STAT3 is in the dimeric form. An α-helix
linker domain joins the latter with the SH2 domain, which is essential
for the binding of STAT3 to phosphorylated receptors and for its dimerization
(residues: 493–583). This process is mainly facilitated by
the SH2 domain, as each monomer interacts after the phosphorylation
of a specific tyrosine residue (Y705) located in the transactivation
domain.13,14 Therefore, in an attempt to avoid the dimerization,
the SH2 domain has traditionally been the main target for drug design,
mostly accompanied by computational studies relying on molecular docking
calculations or similar structure-based approaches,15−23 despite no crystallographic data being available up to date to support
them. These ligands attempt to compete with phosphorylated p-Y705
at the site known to recognize phosphorylated residues24,25 with limited success. An alternative, represented by OPB-3112126 and OPB-51602,4 is
to target an allosteric site at the SH2 domain: these compounds bind
to a pocket different from the one binding p-Y705.4,26 Furthermore,
STAT3 can undergo other post-translational modifications besides Y705
phosphorylation, such as S727 phosphorylation,13,27 and it has been experimentally demonstrated that unphosphorylated
STAT3 can dimerize and bind to DNA. This provides an alternative strategy
to targeting the SH2 domain directly. Due to the challenges coupled
with the effective targeting of STAT3 SH2 domains, other STAT3 domains
have thus been explored in the development of potent and selective
STAT3 inhibitors. Recently, several inhibitors have been identified
to bind to the DNA-binding domain (DBD), which has been initially
overlooked due to its potential specificity problems. Experimental
evidence shows that its binding by small molecules permits the dimer
formation, whereas disrupts the DNA–protein binding.28−30 The exploration through alternatives to the SH2 domain might be
the key to unlock the STAT3 “druggability” problem.
The conservation of the three-dimensional structure of the whole protein
is crucial for the activity of STAT3. Experimental data have demonstrated
that point mutations in the linker domain suggest contacts with both
the DNA-binding and SH2 domains, which could cause structural changes
that severely affect STAT3 activity.31 Alanine
scanning demonstrated that the modification of interdomain hydrogen
bonds can produce a significant decrease (i.e., K551A, W546A) or increase
(D570K) in the STAT3–DNA-binding compared to that in the wild-type
protein.31 Understanding the effect of
point mutations on STAT3 activity at the atomistic level could provide
significant information about novel binding sites, unveiling new ways
to target STAT3 by small-molecule ligands.

The lack of a ligand-bound
crystallized structure hinders the path
for an effective structure-based ligand design for both computational
and medicinal chemists. Only a few moderate-resolution crystal structures
of mouse STAT3 (PDB id: 1BG1,93CWG,7 and 4E68(8)) are available, and none of them present
a bound ligand. A small number of STAT3 inhibitors are under clinical
trials, but in most cases their binding sites at STAT3 and hence their
binding modes remain unknown. Among them, napabucasin (BBI-608) is
a first-in-class cancer stemness inhibitor that targets STAT3,12 which is being tested (phase 3) as a treatment
in advanced colorectal cancer.11 Ji and
co-workers reported that napabucasin binds in a pocket between the
linker and the DNA-binding domain in a STAT3 crystal structure,32 but the crystal structure has not been disclosed.

In this study, we addressed the druggability of the STAT3 dimer
at the atomistic level of detail by performing equilibrium all-atom
molecular dynamics (MD) and umbrella-sampling (US) simulations to
determine the behavior of the wild-type and mutated STAT3. Monitoring
the time evolution of the different domains at a time scale of hundreds
of nanosceconds revealed their differential behaviors in terms of
molecular flexibility and their ability to bind DNA when point mutations
were introduced. The examination of mutation-induced structural changes
directed us to new sites amenable to inhibition by small-molecule
ligands. Furthermore, the construction of a homology model of ligand-bound
STAT3 along with MD and US simulations helped us understand the behavior
of a ligand that interacts with a newly identified “druggable”
region of STAT3. Since this study focuses on the DBD and its interaction
with DNA, we took special interest in Husby’s previous work,
which investigated the interaction between STAT3 and DNA.33

Results and Discussion
Mutations Directly Affect
the Sampled Configurations of the
STAT3 Dimer
In the study by Mertens and co-workers, several
mutations were indicated as crucial to control the DNA retention time
within its respective binding cleft at STAT3.31 These mutations occurred either in the DNA-binding domain or in
the interdomain region. Prior to the US simulations to evaluate the
DNA-binding in the mutated systems, a series of 50 ns MD simulations
are performed to equilibrate the system and identify different behaviors
of the studied systems with regard to the WT. Systems have been studied
for the amount of time that Husby’s work claims to be necessary
to achieve an energetically conserved and stable simulation.33 Our results agree with those of Husby, as we
could observe how one of the protein monomers is more flexible than
the other and that root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) variations are
mainly capitalized by the loops of SH2 and the coiled-coil domains.

Figure 1 View of the mutated residues that form interdomain interactions
and affect STAT3 (PDB code 1BG1) behavior, particularly DNA-binding. SH2 domain (cyan),
linker domain (orange), DNA-binding domain (red), and DNA (blue) are
highlighted. Side-chains of the target residues are displayed as gray
sticks.

One of the most significant configurational
changes occurred within
the D570K mutant, as the DNA double helix shifted downward (Figure 2). This was most
likely caused by the electrostatic effects at the residue located
in the interface between the linker and the DNA-binding domain. The
modification of the side-chain charge from negative (D) to positive
(K) increased favorable protein interaction with the negatively charged
nucleic backbone. This tightened the DNA-binding, resulting in a higher
average DNA RMSD when compared to that of the crystal structure. It
strongly indicates that the end-point configurations of the protein–DNA
complexes play a significant role in their binding free energy, since
the protein–nucleotide interactions change significantly between
different mutants.

Figure 2 MD simulations show conformational changes between WT
(blue) and
D570K (red) STAT3 dimer systems. In the D570K mutant, one of the monomers
is shifted (panel A to panel B), changing the conformational landscape
of the dimer. Panel C shows how the position of the DNA duplex is
shifted downward in the D570K mutant compared to the WT.

We assessed whether the conformational changes induced by
the D570K
mutation were observed in other mutations. Figure 3 shows root-mean-square deviation (RMSD)
plots of all STAT3 considered in this study as well as the WT protein.
Except D570K, there were no large differences in protein RMSDs between
the mutated STAT3 dimers and WT. This gap between D570K and other
mutants is likely to arise from the combination of electrostatic and
steric effects (all other mutations replaced large and polar residues
with the smaller and apolar alanine), which affect the intrinsic dynamics
of the coiled-coil (CC) domain. Hence, the dynamics of the CC domain
might “tune” DNA–STAT3 interactions by allowing
adjacent SH2 and DBD domains to improve their structural “fit”
to the DNA.

Figure 3 Protein (A) and DNA (B) RMSDs after 50 ns of MD simulation. The
D570K (blue) mutation shows a higher RMSD in both protein and DNA
counterparts compared to the other mutations and WT-STAT3.

To follow up on the effects of the mutations that control
DNA retention
at the STAT3 on the structure, dynamics, and energetics of STAT3–DNA
complexes, we carried out a set of umbrella-sampling (US) simulations,
where DNA has been pulled from the STAT3 dimer. This process was studied
using a series of US windows and simulated for 10 ns each.

The
potential of mean force (PMF) calculated via the weighted histogram
analysis method (WHAM) was consistent with the results reported by
Mertens and co-workers31 in most cases.
Experimental results showed a drop in the DNA-binding for the tested
interdomain mutations (EE434/435AA, W546A, and K551A) through time
and an extraordinarily high retention time for D570K, with 100% DNA-binding
even after 2 h.31 The WT STAT3 had a higher
energy barrier to reach its unbound state in comparison to the W546A
mutant (Table 1). The
mutant shows a lower retention time, which indicates that interdomain
interactions between mutated residues and E434 are crucial for STAT3–DNA-binding.
Therefore, disrupting these interactions could represent an attractive
strategy to target STAT3 by small molecules. K551A shows a profile
similar to that of D570K, but presents a PMF value lower than that
of the mutation and a few kcal/mol more than that of the WT (Figure 4 and Table 1).

Figure 4 Potential of mean force
(PMF) of dissociation of DNA from the STAT3
dimer. The W546A (purple) mutant shows a lower PMF than the WT (violet),
whereas the PMF of K551A (brown) mutant is in the same range as that
of the WT. Both EE434435AA (green) and D570K (marine green) would
have displayed similar results, but the interaction between the DNA
duplex and DBD of one STAT3 monomer resulted in higher PMF values
than expected in later sampling windows. This indicates that DNA–protein
interactions are more favorable in these mutants relative to the WT.
The BBI-608 binding (blue) showed a trend similar to that of EE434435AA
and D570K mutations, but much more pronounced.

The equilibrium MD simulations as well as
PMF showed that the binding
affinity of D570K to DNA is more favorable than that of any other
mutant and more than that of WT STAT3 (Figure 4). This indicates that this mutation promotes
a tight binding between STAT3 and DNA, with a higher energy gap for
DNA release upon pulling. The PMF curve showed that DNA-pulling from
D570K required a higher energy gap to release the DNA from the STAT3
dimer. The experimental retention time correlated with the simulations
when compared to WT STAT3. The data showed that DNA-binding to D570K
was persistent through time, did not drive transcription, and resisted
dephosphorylation, and thus prevented STAT3 from exerting its function.12

Collectively, these results indicate that
D570K promotes a tight
DNA-binding, so much that the bound duplex stays “locked”
between the dimers, which effectively inhibits STAT3 by preventing
it from releasing DNA and exerting its function as a transcription
factor.

The major discrepancy between our simulations and experimental
data was observed for the EE434/435AA double mutant. In the simulations,
the mutant showed a higher PMF value than the WT, which indicated
that its DNA-binding affinity should be higher, whereas experimental
data showed that its behavior resembled that of the W546A mutant,
which has shown a considerable drop of DNA-binding through time. Analysis
of the final US windows indicated that the middle of the DNA duplex
interacted favorably with the DNA-binding domain of one STAT3 monomer,
but not another. Therefore, the US curve of the EE434435AA mutant
displayed higher values arising from these interactions (DNA–STAT3
monomer) rather than from favorable interactions of the DNA–STAT3
dimer, as was the case with the D570K mutant.

Mertens’
results31 are based
on 60 to 100 min experiments that evaluate the percentage of DNA-binding
of STAT3. This process would include several STAT3 molecules that
would most likely go through several mechanistic cycles. Therefore,
it is plausible that we did not sample the conformations that are
contributing to these results.

Arginine R414 Acts as a
“Gatekeeper” for DNA-Binding
All simulations
indicated significant conformational changes of
the arginine R414, which were required to release DNA (or to allow
the DNA-binding to the STAT3 dimer). R414 has been shown previously
as one of the main residues for DNA identification and binding,33 but was not disclosed as a gatekeeper residue.
It is at a close distance from the DNA, and its initial position did
not allow the DNA to exit from the dimer. By acting as a gatekeeper
of DNA-binding, R414 exerted a key role in controlling the opening
and closing of the STAT3 dimer as well as tuned the dynamics of STAT3
monomers by modulating intradomain DBD–SH2, CC–SH2,
DBD–LD, and CC–LD interactions.(Figure 5)

Figure 5 Conformational changes of arginine R414 observed
during our simulations.
Evolution of the DNA duplex and R414 position over the simulation
time is depicted by colors, from red to white. Along the DNA-pulling
pathway from the STAT3 dimer, the R414 side-chain rotates, allowing
the dissociation to occur.

Inhibition of STAT3 by Napabucasin (BBI-608)
The results
of simulations of apoSTAT3 (WT and mutants) highlighted
a set of interdomain residues, explaining their effect on STAT3 behavior
and function at the atomistic level of detail. These observations
may pave the way to novel strategies for STAT3 inhibition using small-molecule
ligands. Traditionally, the structure-guided ligand design for STAT3
inhibition focused on targeting the SH2 domain, which intended to
prevent STAT3 dimerization. Although several inhibitors have been
described to bind to the SH2 domain,18,34−38 there is no crystal structure available to confirm it, and most
studies focusing on the SH2 domain binders relied mainly on semi-rigid
molecular-docking calculations, which may raise the question as to
whether the SH2 domain is the binding site for their studied molecules.
A few inhibitors such as OPB-31121 and OPB-51602 proved their binding
to an allosteric site in the SH2 domain via mutagenesis analysis,26 giving some insight into an alternative pocket
to study the SH2-mediated inhibition. Additionally, there are reports
of a few inhibitors that target DBD. Their binding modes have been
virtually assessed, but again, these studies rely heavily on molecular
docking.28−30

Recently, Ji and co-workers reported that napabucasin
(BBI-608), which is one of the few STAT3 inhibitors in advanced clinical
trials (phase 3), binds to a small pocket between the linker and the
DNA-binding domain in a STAT3 crystal structure.32 Since the crystal structure has not been released to the
public domain, we have assessed the druggability of this segment of
STAT3, identified the putative pocket, and subsequently built the
model of BBI-608 bound to STAT3 using the molecular-docking approach,
and then validated the obtained binding mode by the atomistic MD and
US simulations.

Molecular docking was performed by MOE for each
STAT3 monomer separately,
trying to generate the most plausible conformation relying on the
limited data available. Both blind (whole monomer) and targeted (residues
of the identified pocket) docking calculations resulted in a set of
conformations with favorable energy scores and a highly populated
cluster located within the DBD site pocket, in close contact with
residues H332, P333, R335, K573, and D570 (Figure 6). Two conformations, matching the published
data, were found; both were assessed and validated.

Figure 6 Binding pose of BBI-608,
deduced from the data reported by Ji and
co-workers.32 Since the crystal structure
has not been released, we have modeled the most plausible binding
mode by molecular docking. The side-chain of the mutated K570 residue
is displayed and colored green; it is overlapping with the plausible
location of BBI-608.

To validate the binding
mode of BBI-608, MD simulations of the
WT STAT3–DNA–BBI-608 complex were performed for 100
ns in triplicate. Subsequently, the ligand affinity has been calculated.
The ligand docked on either of the SAT3 monomers remained bound through
the whole simulation. Interaction energies calculated by MMPBSA analysis
(g_mmpbsa39 module) resulted in −18.1
± 2.6 kcal/mol, showing a favorable binding.

US simulations,
performed using the same protocol as for STAT3–DNA
complexes, started the pull from the most populated cluster. The calculated
binding affinity has been overestimated (−160 kcal/mol); nevertheless,
it showed a very tight binding. Compared with the results obtained
for protein–DNA complexes described in the previous section,
it implies that the presence of BBI-608 enhances DNA-binding with
an effect similar to that of the D570K mutation. As such, BBI-608
inhibits the function of STAT3 in a manner similar to the D570K mutation,
which does not drive transcription and resists phosphorylation.12 Since D570 has been annotated by Ji et al.32 as the BBI-608-binding-site residue, we concluded
that BBI-608 binding to WT STAT3 generated a DNA–protein interaction
pattern and retention time similar to that of the D570K mutation.

BBI-608 Binding Promotes STAT3 Dimerization
We performed
MD simulations of the BBI-608-bound WT STAT3 dimer without DNA to
study the influence of the ligand on the protein behavior in the absence
of DNA. BBI-608 was bound to each STAT3 monomer, and four 100 ns replicas
showed a variation of results. In only one out of the four replicas,
both BBI-608 molecules remained bound in their pockets through the
whole trajectory, whereas DBD domains of both STAT3 monomers moved
closer to each other, reaching the point of forming interdomain hydrogen
bonds. In one simulation, both ligand molecules dissociated from the
pockets, which caused an opening of the STAT3 dimer, and in the other
two, only one of the ligands left the binding cavity at the 35 and
70 ns marks.

To assess ligand-induced conformational changes
within the DNA entry through both DBD domains, distances between some
of the residues involved in H-bonding (e.g., Q344-G342 and T412-Q344)
were measured and analyzed in all four replicas and compared to the
simulation of the WT STAT3 dimer without DNA and/or BBI-608 bound
(Figure 7).

and G432 and residues T412 and Q344, calculated along a 50 ns MD simulation

dissociated system and both Replicas 2 and 3 (orange and green) keep
their ligand bound through the whole simulation. (B) Close-up and

molecules interacting with each monomer along a 50 ns MD simulation
(three replicas: blue, red, and green). The STAT3 dimer bound to DNA
(black) is shown as the reference.

The STAT3 dimer closed further down in the presence of BBI-608.
This was particularly pronounced in one of the replicas, in which
the distance between monomers reduced to <5 Å. These results
indicate that BBI-608 binding to apoSTAT3 is likely
to trigger conformation changes that would prevent DNA from binding.
In the replica simulation, where both ligands dissociated from STAT3,
the distance between monomers increased upon ligand dissociation,
as both ligands exit via the gap formed between DBD domains of STAT3
monomers.

The protein–ligand interaction energy was calculated,
and
a correlation between ligand dissociation, dimer separation, and poor
ligand affinity could be observed.

The simulations also indicate
that the ligand binding to one of
the STAT3 monomers is more favorable than it binding to another one.
Although interaction energies are favorable for both monomers, one
shows an interaction energy value twice as favorable as for another
monomer. Although the allosteric effects within STAT3 were beyond
the scope of this study, these results strongly suggest that such
effects may occur in STAT3 dimers and contribute to the modulation
of STAT3 by inhibitors. Another theory could be that the model is
not as optimal as expected. Although the used docking poses have an
extraordinary resemblance to Ji’s data,32 only one is shown in the patent. Since this dimer is asymmetrical,
DNA interactions with both cavities will be different and could imply
a different conformation and/or location for the ligand that does
not correspond to the model one. Furthermore, the MD results strongly
indicate that one monomer is much more mobile than the other, and
this is likely to affect protein–ligand affinity fluctuations.

Identification of a Novel Druggable Binding Site
Experimental
results12 combined with the simulations
strongly indicated that targeting the interface between STAT3 monomers
may trigger a response similar to the inhibition by ligands binding
to the DBD domain, and therefore must be explored in structure-based
ligand design efforts. With most STAT3 ligands being designed for
the SH2 domain and just a few for the DBD domain, the identification
of new druggable pockets for STAT3 inhibition is of great interest.

As such, we scanned STAT3 for the presence of potential binding
sites with two pocket detection tools: fpocket40 and MOE’s Site Finder. Upon selection of the dimer
model and different clusters from its MD simulation trajectories,
we confirmed the binding site identified for BBI-608,32 which has been identified by both tools as their top-ranked
site. Interestingly, this site was detected by both fpocket and SiteFinder
for all analyzed structures (Figure 8). In addition, a new pocket within the DNA-binding
domain (in close contact with E434 and E435) was identified. The main
difference between results obtained by both tools is that fpocket
was more prone to detect SH2 domain sites as pockets (Figure 8, B2-3), whereas SiteFinder
identified a novel druggable pocket close to R414 (Figure 8, A1). Ligand binding to the
R414 pocket could result in a possible DNA-release/binding impediment.

of the STAT3 dimer. Sitefinder (A) and fpocket (B)
were used to identify new potential pockets for structure-based drug
design. In both cases the BBI-608 DBD site was identified along with
novel DBD pockets.

Conclusions
The
use of computational approaches based on atomistic molecular
dynamics simulations enabled us to understand the effects of specific
STAT3 mutations, which were described in the literature, and to explain
their modulation of the STAT3 activity. Consistent with the findings
of Mertens and co-workers,32 D570K mutation
exerted its effect by enhancing interactions between STAT3 and DNA,
which interfered with DNA release by the STAT3 dimer and thus inhibited
the protein’s function by not driving transcription and resisting
dephosphorylation. Subsequently, recent identification of a plausible
binding site for the small-molecule STAT3 inhibitor nababucasin (BBI-608)
helped us to deconvolute its inhibition mechanism, which resembled
the effect exerted by the D570K mutation. The identification of the
putative binding site for BBI-608 at the DNA-binding domain may contribute
to the development of novel potent and selective STAT3 inhibitors.
The similarity between the model and the available patent data32 raise the question as to why this pocket has
been overlooked before. Mutated interdomain residues E435, W546, and
K551 unveil a poor binding to DNA, leading to yet another way of targeting
STAT3 by disrupting theses residues, pointing toward possible novel
allosteric binding sites. Structure-based ligand designs targeting
these novel pockets, coupled with novel methodologies, such as employing
the recently developed FragLites,41 are
likely to expand a set of chemotypes active toward STAT3 and contribute
to the development of novel inhibitors of this important yet very
challenging drug target.

Methods
Molecular Modeling of the
Human STAT3 Dimer
Initial
models of dimeric human STAT3 (wild type and mutants) in a complex
with DNA were created using the crystal structure of unphosphorylated
mouse STAT3B (PDB code: 4E68), which spans residues 136–716. The N-terminal
domain has been excluded from the structures subjected to the simulations.
Loops spanning the residues 184–194 and 688–702 were
modeled using the MODELLER interface42,43 available
in UCSF Chimera.44 The DNA double-strand
bound to the model was designed based on 4E68, with the 5′–3′
strand sequence of TGCATTTCCCGTAATC. The final model was subjected
to 20 000 cycles of the steepest descent energy minimization.

The STAT3 mutations (Figure 1), which were selected following the study by Mertens and
co-workers,31 were introduced in UCSF Chimera
by swapping side-chains to the target residues and adjusting new conformations
using Dunbrack’s rotamer library integrated within UCSF Chimera.

Modeling of Ligand-Bound STAT3
The crystal structure
of ligand-bound STAT3 is not yet available; therefore, we built the
most similar model possible with the accessible data. Starting from
the dimer model of wild-type STAT3 described in the previous section,
molecular-docking calculations were performed with MOE,45 using napabucasin (BBI-608) as the ligand. To
ensure the scoring function accuracy with the target and the best
possible fit, both blind (full dimer, residues 136–716) and
targeted docking (pocket described) were performed. Two hundred different
conformations of the ligand were scored for each run using Triangle
Matcher and London ΔG for the first scoring
function. Thereafter, the top 100 conformations were rescored using
Induced Fit and the generalized Born volume integral/weighted surface
area score.45 From the final poses obtained,
one for each monomer was selected based on the score, interactions,
and consistency with the experimental structure shown in Ji’s
work,32 which shows BB1-608 bound to a
pocket located within the DNA–STAT3 interface.

Molecular Dynamics
and Umbrella-Sampling Simulations
To study the effects of
the dynamics of mutations in the STAT3 dimer,
each of the listed mutations was created in UCSF Chimera.44 Structural hydrogens were added and the following
protein parametrization was performed using the Gromacs 2016.0346 suite with AMBERFF99SB-ILDN47 force field. Before pulling the DNA from the complex, the
systems were relaxed with a short equilibrium MD production run. Hence,
a 1 nm cubic box was centered on the structure and the system is solvated
with TIP3P waters. Sodium and chloride ions were added to a concentration
of 0.1 M, resulting in systems with more than seven hundred thousand
atoms. Bonds were constrained using the LINCS48 algorithm. The electrostatic interactions were calculated using
the particle-mesh Ewald method, with a nonbonded cut-off set at 0.1
nm. All structures were minimized via the steepest descent algorithm
for 20 000 steps of 0.02 nm, and minimizations were stopped
when the maximum force fell below 1000 kJ/(mol nm) using the Verlet
cut-off scheme.49 After minimization, temperature
equilibration was performed for 100 ps with a time step of 2 fs with
position restraints applied to the backbone using an NVT. The temperature
coupling was set between the protein and the nonprotein entities by
using a Berendsen thermostat,50 with a
time constant of 0.1 ps, and the temperature set to reach 300 K with
the pressure coupling off. Sequentially, a pressure NPT equilibration
was performed, followed by 100 ps of NVT equilibration, 100 ps of
NPT equilibration, and a production run of 100 ns. The temperature
was set constant at 300 K by using a modified Berendsen thermostat
(τ = 0.1 ps).50 The pressure was
kept constant at 1 bar by Parinello–Rahman isotropic coupling
(τ = 2.0 ps) to a pressure bath.51

For the umbrella-sampling simulation, a 50 ns pre-umbrella
equilibration was carried out, with the complex rotating its principal
axis to align with the z-axis of the simulation box.
A pull sampling was performed using a constant force approach (k = 1000 kJ/(mol nm), with a rate of 0.01 nm) between the
centers of masses of the SH2 domain and the DNA double helix, along
the described path shown in Figure 9. From each corresponding pull simulation, a series
of conformations have been selected to sample the process of entering–exiting
the DNA-binding site. Each of the 25 selected umbrella windows has
been through a 1 ns NPT equilibration run, followed by a 5 ns NPT
distance-restrained production run, totalizing per system 135 ns of
simulation time, using the previously described protocol and parameters.
Afterward, the potential of mean force (PMF) curve of the studied
scenario has been calculated with the weighted histogram analysis
method (WHAM) tool from Gromacs,52 and
associated errors were calculated using both the convergence criteria
and the implemented bootstrap method in Gromacs WHAM. All calculations
for the analysis were made using the Gromacs tools.

Figure 9 Description of the STAT3
umbrella-sampling (US) simulations performed
in this study. After 100 ns of equilibrium MD production run, DNA
is pulled out of the dimer and a series of windows are selected that
will be simulated for 10 ns to compute the potential of mean force
(PMF) of DNA.
