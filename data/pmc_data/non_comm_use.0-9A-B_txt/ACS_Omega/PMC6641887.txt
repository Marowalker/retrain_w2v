Layered
double hydroxide (LDH) platelets with nanosized and microsized
level were synthesized and used as fillers in an isotactic polypropylene
(PP) matrix. The nucleation and crystallization behavior of PP/LDH
composites (denoted as 1-PPLx and 2-PPLx for composites containing nanosized and microsized LDH, respectively; x represents the mass percentage of LDH) was investigated
by differential scanning calorimetry and polarized optical microscopy
techniques. It is found that the crystallization temperature of PP/LDH
composites is largely enhanced and the half crystallization time is
reduced remarkably relative to pure PP, especially for 2-PPLx composite. The 2-PPLx composite exhibits
stronger heterogeneous nucleating ability and faster crystallization
rate than 1-PPLx samples with the same LDH loading.
In addition, the crystallized PP/LDH composites possess significantly
enhanced thermal stability, gas barrier, and flame-retardant properties
relative to neat PP, which would show a broad application prospect
in engineering plastics and packing industry.

1 Introduction
Polymer-based
composites filled with inorganic compounds have been
regarded as one of the most promising materials because the properties
of polymers could be improved significantly with the incorporation
of inorganic fillers.1,2 Among the most versatile polymers,
polypropylene (PP) is extensively used in industries because of its
nontoxicity, corrosion resistance, and good mechanical properties.
However, the semicrystalline feature (crystallinity < 60%) of PP
normally induces low transparency, long process duration, and poor
impact performance, which restricts its application as engineering
plastics and transparent packing materials. A large number of inorganic
compounds, such as calcium carbonate nanoparticles,3 carbon nanotubes/fibers,4 and
metal oxides (e.g., TiO2,5 SiO2,6 and ZnO7), have been incorporated into the PP matrix as fillers for better
mechanical properties or new functionalities. Recently, lamellar fillers
have attracted great interest for preparing PP-based nanocomposites
with various unique properties, such as gas barriers and flame-retardant
properties.8−12

Layered double hydroxide (LDH) is a class of lamellar compounds
made up of positively charged brucite-like layers and interlayer charge-compensating
anions.13−16 The flexibility in tuning the composition of both host layers and
interlayer anions endows LDH materials with various application prospects
in catalysts,17 biomaterials,18 and functional additives.19−21 In particular,
LDH is considered as a new emerging class of nanofillers for the preparation
of multifunctional polymer/LDH nanocomposites.22−24 The addition
of LDH not only improves the mechanical properties but also endows
the polymer/LDH nanocomposites with better properties. For instance,
Wang and co-workers22,25−27 developed a
solution blending method to prepare highly dispersed polymer/LDH composites,
which exhibit enhanced flame-retardant property and good tunability
in rheological behavior. Yan et al.24 used
LDH as a UV-blocking material for improving the thermal stability
and photostability of the composites.

For PP/LDH composites,
it has been revealed that the incorporation
of LDH not only reinforces the physicochemical properties of the composite28 but also alters the crystallization behavior
of PP.29 It is well-known that the properties
of semicrystalline polymers are correlated with their crystalline
structure which in turn optimizes their physical properties and processing
conditions. The fillers can change the crystallization manner30 and can tune the structural/morphological characteristics31,32 of the semicrystalline polymers. Therefore, it is of great importance
to investigate the crystallization behavior of polymer/filler composites.33,34 Although great progress has been achieved on the development of
PP/LDH nanocomposites, the crystallization behavior and related crystallization
mechanism of the nanocomposites have been rarely reported.29,35,36 Lonkar and Singh35 revealed that the heterogeneous nucleation and crystallization
rate of PP were promoted by LDH. Nagendra et al.29 found that LDH treated by aqueous miscible organic solvent22 exerts remarkable influence on crystallization
kinetics of PP after sonication.

In this work, LDH platelets
with different particle sizes were
synthesized and applied as inorganic fillers to prepare PP/LDH composites.
The crystallization behavior of PP with the assistance of LDH platelets
was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized
optical microscopy (POM) techniques. A heterogeneous nucleation mechanism
is proposed for the PP/LDH composites followed by a three-dimensional
(3D) growth of spherocrystals. It is demonstrated that the LDH filler
not only accelerated the crystallization rate of PP (especially for
microsized LDH) but also enhanced the comprehensive properties of
PP/LDH composites.

2 Results and Discussion
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure 1a,b) display a well-defined and high-purity
LDH phase, with an interlayer spacing of 0.75 nm, corresponding to
carbonate LDH. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Figure 1c,d) show the individual
LDH platelets with particle sizes of 200–300 nm and 2–3
μm for the products prepared by the hydrothermal and homogeneous
co-precipitation method, respectively. The average diameter is 280
nm and 2.5 μm, revealed by laser grain-size analysis (insets
of Figure 1c,d).

and SEM images of LDH prepared by the (a,c) hydrothermal
and (b,d) homogeneous co-precipitation method, respectively. The insets
of (b) and (d) illustrate the particle size distribution of the two
samples.

The MgAl LDHs prepared below were
incorporated with PP using the
solution blending method to prepare PP/LDH composites. The composites
involving smaller and larger LDH are denoted as 1-PPLx and 2-PPLx, respectively, in which x represents the weight percent of LDH in the composites. The dispersion
of an LDH filler in PP/LDH composites (LDH loading = 5%) was observed
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure 2), which show that both nanosized
and microsized LDH platelets are homogeneously distributed in the
PP matrix.

DSC was carried out to explore
the crystallization behavior of
PP/LDH composites. PP and PP/LDH were first heated from room temperature
to 200 °C and held for 3 min to erase the thermal history, then
cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C/min to measure
the crystallization temperature of pure PP (Tc,p) and PP/LDH composites (Tc,c) (Figure 3), and
finally reheated to 200 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min to record
the melting temperature (Tm) (Figure S1, Supporting Information). It is observed that
the crystallization peak temperature of pure PP is located at 112.8
°C, whereas it is enhanced for PP/LDH composites (summarized
in Table 1), demonstrating
that both LDHs have the effect on inducing PP crystallization. Moreover,
the Tc,c rises with increasing LDH content,
which is indicative of a heterogeneous nucleation mechanism with the
presence of LDH. Interestingly, 2-PPLx presents a
higher crystallization temperature at equal loading of LDH compared
with 1-PPLx.

PP and PP/LDH composites
containing (a) nanosized LDH and (b) microsized LDH with a cooling
rate of 10 °C/min.

The
difference in crystallization peak temperature between pure
PP and PP/filler composites (ΔTc = Tc,c – Tc,p) is an important parameter to evaluate the nucleation activity
of the nanofiller. It should be noted that the ΔTc for 2-PPLx composite is among the highest
level (summarized in Table S1, Supporting Information), compared with previously reported inorganic nanofillers, illustrating
an excellent nucleation activity for microsized LDH. For all the PPLx composites, only one peak is observed at ∼164 °C
(melting temperature, Tm) during the melting
process, ascribed to the formation of monoclinic α-form PP.
Furthermore, the XRD patterns of PP/LDH composites (Figure 4) show a diffraction superposition
of LDH and α-PP, where the reflections at 11.8° and 23.7°
correspond to the (003) and (006) plane of LDH, respectively, and
the other diffraction peaks at 14.2°, 17.0°, 18.7°,
21.3°, and 22.1° are the reflections corresponding to the
(110), (040), (130), (111), and (041) crystalline planes of the monoclinic
α form of PP, respectively. No other form of PP was induced
during the isothermal crystallization process.

PP/LDH composites containing (a) nanosized
LDH and (b) microsized LDH. Green star represents the diffraction
peaks of LDH phase.

To further understand
the crystallization behavior of PPLx, the isothermal
crystallization of all samples at 135
°C was investigated. A broad crystallization peak of pure PP
is presented from ∼3 to ∼40 min (black line in Figure 5a,b). Upon incorporation
with LDH, the peak position undergoes a negative shift accompanied
with a narrower peak width as the LDH loading increases, which indicates
that the presence of LDH improves the crystallization rate of PP.
The relative crystallinity (Xt) was obtained by the integrals at different times (t) divided by the total integral of heat flow (Figure 5c,d). The half crystallization
time (t1/2), defined as the time when Xt reaches 50%, is a general
parameter to inspect the crystallization rate. The t1/2 of PP/LDH composites shows a decrease with the increment
of LDH loading for both 1-PPLx and 2-PPLx composites (Table 2). In addition, t1/2 of 2-PPLx is much smaller than that of 1-PPLx at
equal LDH loading, indicative of a higher crystallization rate for
2-PPLx composites.

The following
Avrami equation37 was
used to quantitatively elaborate the relationship between LDH content
and crystallization kinetics 1  where Xt is the relative crystallinity at time t; n is the Avrami exponent relating to
the nucleation mechanism
and the crystal growth geometry; and k is the crystallization
rate constant including both nucleation and growth. In general, the
Avrami equation is transformed into a double-logarithmic equation
form as follows 2  The Avrami exponent n was
obtained from the slope of the plot for ln[−ln(1 – Xt)] versus ln t (Figure 5e,f) and
listed in Table 2.
The n value of pure PP is 2.83 and varies from 2.88
to 3.05 for all of these PP/LDH composites. The value of n is close to 3, indicating a typical 3D crystal growth obeying the
heterogeneous nucleation mechanism.

The crystallization thermal
dynamics and kinetics of PP and its
composites containing 5% LDH were further analyzed based on the theory
of Hoffman–Lauritzen.36 The crystallization
rate (G), depending on the crystallization temperature
(Tc), is expressed as follows 3  where G0 is a
pre-exponential factor, which is independent of temperature; U* is the activation energy needed for the chain movement; T∞ stands for the temperature at which
polymer chains are motionless (T∞ = Tg – 30 K, Tg is the glass transition temperature); R is the universal gas constant; ΔT is the
undercooling temperature (ΔT = Tm0 – Tc; Tm0 is the equilibrium melting temperature);
and f is the correction factor, f = 2Tc/(Tm0 + Tc), in consideration of the fact that the equilibrium
melting enthalpy (ΔHm0) varies with temperature. For a heterogeneous
nucleation, the nucleation constant Kg can be expressed as follows 4  where b0 is the
distance between two adjacent fold planes; σ and σe are the lateral and fold surface free energies, respectively;
and kB is the Boltzmann constant (kB = 1.38 × 10–23 J K–1). The values of the above-mentioned parameters are
listed in Table 3 (obtained
from refs (6)(38),–41).

Table 3 Values for the Parameters
in Eqs 3 and 4
U* (J K–1)	Tg (K)	T∞ (K)	Tm0 (°C)	b0 (Å)	σ (J m–2)	ΔHm0 (J m–3)

The reciprocal of half crystallization time (1/t1/2) is approximately equal to the crystallization
rate
(G). As shown in Figure 6a, all of these samples give a faster crystallization
rate in low temperature range, and the microsized LDH promotes PP
crystallization at a higher rate under identical conditions. The nucleation
constant Kg can be calculated from eq 3, taking the double-logarithmic
transformation 5  The value of G was substituted
by 1/t1/2. Figure S2 (Supporting Information) demonstrates the straight lines based
on the plot of ln G + U*/R(Tc – T∞) versus 1/TcΔTf. The value of Kg can be obtained
from the slope of the straight lines (summarized in Table 4).

temperatures: (a) plots of 1/t1/2 vs temperature
and (b) plots of the free energy of nucleation (ΔG*) vs crystallization temperature.

σe (J m–2)	0.198	0.177	0.159	
The
fold surface free energy (σe) is an important
parameter to evaluate the nucleating effect of a nanofiller, that
is, a nanofiller with high nucleating ability can reduce σe.42 The σe of
PP, 1-PPL5, and 2-PPL5 was calculated (through eq 4) to be 0.198, 0.177, and 0.159 J m–2 (Table 4), respectively,
in accordance with the superior ability of microsized LDH toward PP
nucleation.

The free energy (ΔG*) necessary
for the
formation of a nucleus with critical size was calculated by the following
equation 6  

As shown in Figure 6b, for these samples, ΔG* increases
as the
temperature rises, and the incorporation of LDH decreases the energy
barrier for the nucleation of PP/LDH composites. Similar result was
also observed in other PP/inorganic filler systems (e.g., MoS2/PP composite).43 Significantly,
the ΔG* of 2-PPL5 is lower than that of 1-PPL5
at the same crystallization temperature. This result indicates that
LDH reduces the free energy of nucleation and the microsized LDH shows
a better performance. Therefore, the overall crystallization rate
is improved markedly by LDH, especially for microsized LDH.

It is well-known that the crystallization morphology of PP is greatly
affected by the fillers. The POM images (Figure 7) display common spherulitic structure with
well-defined boundaries (spherulite size: ∼70 μm) for
pristine PP after isothermal crystallization. However, the spherulitic
structure of PP/LDH composites is not as perfect as neat PP with much
smaller spherulite size, which is attributed to the enhanced crystallization
rate. For 1-PPLx composites, the samples with 1 and
5% LDH loading still present spherulitic structure with smaller size,
whereas no defined spherulites are discovered in the field of vision
with a further increase of LDH loading. The 2-PPLx composites show a similar variation in the crystal structure, but
only 2-PPL1 sample maintains perfect spherulites. No defined spherulite
is observed for 2-PPL5 and 2-PPL10 composites.

Figure 7 POM images of PP and
PP/LDH composites crystallized isothermally
at 135 °C: (a) PP, (b) 1-PPL1, (c) 1-PPL5, (d) 1-PPL10, (e) 2-PPL1,
(f) 2-PPL5, and (g) 2-PPL10.

The variety of crystallization morphology of 1-PPL5 and 2-PPL5
with different crystallization times was further recorded by in situ
POM. For 1-PPL5 composite, only a few small crystals appear randomly
at 5 min (Figure 8a).
The crystals grow gradually in size, form into spherulites with clear
boundaries (Figure 8b–d), and then terminate at 30 min as a result of the spherulite
collision. In the case of 2-PPL5 composite, the density of nuclei
is much higher than that of 1-PPL5; numerous tiny crystals emerge
at 2.5 min (Figure 8e). The crystals keep growing into a bigger imperfect spherulite,
which is accomplished within 15 min approximately (Figure 8e–h). It is thus concluded
that the presence of LDH particles provides heterogeneous nuclei for
PP crystallization, leading to the increase of spherulite density
and decrease of spherulite size. In comparison with nanosized LDH,
the microsized LDH induces more nuclei in the PP matrix and thus exhibits
a stronger heterogeneous nucleating ability. The precise epitaxial
mechanism of PP on LDH is still under working.

Figure 8 In situ POM images of
(a–d) 1-PPL5 and (e–h) 2-PPL5
composites at various crystallization times.

The size of LDH not only affects the heterogeneous nucleating
ability
but also impacts the thermal conductive property of the composites,
which consequently plays a key role on the crystallization behavior
of polymer/filler composites.44 The thermal
diffusivity and specific heat capacity of two kinds of LDH were measured
by a laser flash thermal conductivity analyzer and DSC. The thermal
conductivity (λ) is calculated by the equation λ = Cp × ρ × a, where Cp is the specific heat capacity; ρ is the density of circular
plate samples; and a is the thermal diffusivity.
As shown in Table 5, the thermal conductivity of microsized LDH is 1.39 W m–1 K–1, which is much larger than that of nanosized
LDH (0.85 W m–1 K–1). The higher
thermal conductivity of microsized LDH enables the temperature of
the PP/microsized LDH composite to drop faster, when cooling from
the melting temperature to the crystallization temperature. In case
the temperature at the LDH/PP interface is lower than the critical
condition, the nucleation will occur first on the LDH surface (as
shown in Scheme 1),
and then the crystals grow gradually and form into spherulites. Therefore,
the PP composites filled by microsized LDH show a faster crystallization
rate than the PP/nanosized LDH composites.

The influence of LDH on the thermal stability of PP/LDH
composites
was investigated using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) (Figure 9). All of these PP/LDH
composites display enhanced thermal stability than pristine PP judged
from the 50% weight loss temperature (T0.5) (summarized in Table 6). Interestingly, 1-PPLx represents better thermal
stability compared with 2-PPLx with equal loading
of LDH.

The flammability
study (see details in the Supporting Information, Figure S3 and Table S2) reveals that
nanosized LDH has a better effect on the flame retardancy of PP/LDH
composites. The superior thermal stability and flame-retardant property
of 1-PPLx are ascribed to the lower thermal conductivity
of nanosized LDH, which hinders the heat transport throughout the
composite. In addition, the gas permeability property of PP/LDH composites
was also studied (Figure S4, Supporting Information); an inhibited oxygen transmission rate of PP/LDH composites was
found compared with neat PP, and 2-PPLx exhibits
superior gas barrier behavior than 1-PPLx because
of the larger LDH platelet size and higher spherulite density.

3 Conclusions
In summary, nanosized LDH and microsized
LDH were incorporated
with isotactic PP by a solution blending method. The nucleation and
crystallization behavior of PP/LDH composites with various LDH loadings
was investigated by DSC and POM techniques. As the LDH loading increases,
the spherulite density of α-PP becomes larger and the spherulite
size is significantly reduced. A particle-size-dependent crystallization
property is observed for PP/LDH composites: the microsized LDH provides
more nuclei and shows stronger heterogeneous nucleation ability for
PP crystallization, resulting in a faster crystallization rate. Several
physical properties, including thermal stability, gas barrier property,
and flame retardancy, are improved greatly after incorporation of
the LDH filler. The crystallized PP/LDH composites have broad applications
in building materials, medical devices, and packaging products.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Reagents and Materials
The isotactic
PP with melt flow index of 2.2 was purchased from Shanghai Aladdin
Reagent Co. Ltd. Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, Al(NO3)3·9H2O, NaOH, Na2CO3, urea, ethanol, and acetone were analytical
grade chemicals and used without further purification.

4.2 Preparation of MgAl LDHs with Different Particle
Sizes
The hydrothermal method was used to prepare nanosized
MgAl LDH. A 50 mL of mixed metal salt solution containing 0.025 mol
Mg(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.0125 mol
Al(NO3)3·9H2O was added dropwise
into a Na2CO3 solution (0.5 mol/L, 50 mL) with
continuous stirring. The pH of the reaction solution was controlled
at ∼10 using a 2 mol/L NaOH solution. Finally, the suspension
was transferred into an autoclave and placed into an oven at 150 °C
for 24 h.

The microsized LDH was prepared by a homogeneous coprecipitation
method using urea as the alkali resource. Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, Al(NO3)3·9H2O, and urea were dissolved in deionized water with concentrations
of 0.08, 0.04, and 0.48 mol/L, respectively. The mixture was aged
in a three-neck round-bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser
at 100 °C under continuous stirring for 24 h.

Both of these
products were washed with deionized water until the
pH value reached to 7.0, followed by separation by a centrifuge (4000
rpm). Subsequently, the LDH product was washed three times using ethanol
and then washed with acetone for another three times. The resulting
LDH sample was directly used for the preparation of PP/LDH composites.

4.3 Preparation of PP/LDH Composites
The solution
blending method developed by Wang et al.22 was used to prepare a series of PP/LDH composites
(LDH content = 1, 5, and 10% by weight). PP (5 g) was dissolved into
xylene (25 mL) in a round-bottle flask with a reflux condenser in
a nitrogen atmosphere at 150 °C. After PP was completely dissolved,
another 25 mL of xylene containing different weight percent of MgAl
LDH was added. The mixed solution was continuously stirred for 24
h and poured into 50 mL of ethanol. The precipitation was filtered
and washed thoroughly with ethanol to remove the residual xylene.
Finally, the product was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for
24 h.
