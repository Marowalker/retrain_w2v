Systems combining
photopolymerization and thermal polymerization
have already been reported in the literature. Upon near-infrared (NIR)
light exposure, this principle of polymerization is called photoinduced
thermal polymerization or photothermal polymerization. Thanks to an
NIR dye used as the light-to-heat convertor (called hereafter a heater),
an alkoxyamine (e.g., BlocBuilder-MA) is dissociated upon NIR light
irradiation, initiating the free-radical polymerization of methacrylates.
In the present paper, a novel approach is presented for the first
time to decompose the alkoxyamine through a direct heat generation
upon mid-infrared irradiation by a CO2 laser at 10.6 μm.
Compared with previous approaches, there is no additional heater used
in this work, as the heat is directly generated by laser irradiation
on the alkoxyamine/monomer system. The polymerization can be initiated
for benchmark methacrylate monomers with spatial controllability,
that is, only in the laser-irradiated area, opening the way for laser
write or three-dimensional printing applications in the presence of
fillers.

==== Body
Introduction
Photopolymerization of (meth)acrylates
is reported widespread in
the literature. In general, the polymerization process is possible
with a photoinitiator, that is, a generator of active species (e.g.,
cations or free radicals) after light absorption. Traditionally, UV
light is used for such polymerizations, but now, the use of visible
light has been democratized.1,2 Thanks to the use of
these longer wavelength light, curing of filled samples and more particularly
composites is more and more promising. More particularly, the use
of near-infrared (NIR) light for photopolymerization of (meth)acrylates
is a good answer to such an issue.3−6 The higher the wavelength is, the deeper
the penetration of light inside the media, especially in the presence
of fillers, can be. In the present communication, we propose to use
long-wavelength (mid-IR CO2 laser), rather than visible
or even NIR, light for the polymerization process. Carbon dioxide
lasers can deliver light with the wavelength in the mid-infrared region,
as presented in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Classical Photopolymerization vs Polymerization Upon CO2 Laser Exposure
Actually, the use of carbon dioxide lasers for polymer applications
is not new. Indeed, carbon dioxide lasers are already extensively
used in selective laser sintering.7−9 In such processes, blends
of polymer powders are typically employed, and the carbon dioxide
laser is used to melt the powders to construct the shape of the desired
object in three dimensions (3D).

Herein, the principle is different:
the heat delivered by the laser
will be used for the first time to decompose a thermosensitive initiator,
namely an alkoxyamine, dispersed in a liquid resin. To the best of
our knowledge, very few studies have been devoted to this principle
of polymerization, and all of these works are based on thermal initiators
other than alkoxyamines.10−12 In particular, methyl methacrylate
was successfully polymerized with a continuous-wave CO2 laser.10 Examples of frontal polymerization
ignited by CO2 laser are given in refs (13) and (14). Therefore, we propose
to polymerize a benchmark methacrylate monomer blend (Mix-MA, depicted
in Scheme 2) containing
an alkoxyamine as the thermal initiator (BlocBuilder-MA).

Structures of the Monomers and the Alkoxyamine
Results and Discussion
As specificity, in classical
photopolymerization processes, the
transitions involved during the excitation of the photoinitiator are
between well-defined electronic levels (i.e., between its ground state
and its excited state). To get this result, the wavelength of the
light and thus the energy of the photons must be compatible with the
energy gap between the ground state and the excited state to allow
the occurrence of electronic transition. Therefore, a high energy
is usually necessary to induce such an electronic transition. As the
energy delivered by the light is inversely proportional to the wavelength,
the photon energy is extremely low while using infrared light and
not sufficient to enable the electrons to reach the higher electronic
excited state. With such low-energy wavelengths, transitions are only
observed between vibrational levels. Therefore, the loss of energy
from the vibrationally excited levels is in the form of heat. Therefore,
upon CO2 laser irradiation, the sample is locally heated,
leading to a potential homolysis of the alkoxyamine (BlocBuilder-MA),
enabling the initiation of free-radical polymerization. The mechanism
is presented in Scheme 3. Such a behavior can be demonstrated through electron spin resonance
(ESR) experiments. Indeed, using a solution of BlocBuilder-MA in tert-butylbenzene (10–4 M), almost no
radical species were observed (Figure 1, curve a) before irradiation. Conversely, upon exposure
to carbon dioxide laser, an important increase of the radical signal
was detected (Figure 1, curve b). The ESR spectrum obtained clearly corresponded to the
nitroxide radicals generated by the cleavage of BlocBuilder-MA, that
is, the acyclic β-phosphorylated nitroxide SG1 (N-tert-butyl-N-[1-(diethoxyphosphoryl)-2,2-dimethylpropyl-N-oxyl nitroxide) radical characterized by the hyperfine
coupling constants: aN = 13.7 G; aP = 45.7 G.2

into tert-butylbenzene (a) before and (b) after exposure
to CO2 laser.

Scheme 3 Mechanism of IR-Induced
Decomposition of Alkoxyamines
Considering that initiating carbon-centered radicals were also
generated upon irradiation with carbon dioxide laser, polymerization
experiments were carried out. A 2 wt % of BlocBuilder-MA was dissolved into the benchmark monomer
blend and irradiated by the carbon dioxide laser. Remarkably, the
polymerization of Mix-MA could be induced only in the simultaneous
presence of BlocBuilder-MA and IR light (Figure 2, curve 3), that is, no polymerization occurs
at the investigated timescale without IR irradiation (Figure 2, curve 1) or without BlocBuilder-MA
(Figure 2, curve 2).

Figure 2 Polymerization
profiles of mix-MA (methacrylate function conversion
vs irradiation time): (1) without irradiation; (2) upon CO2 laser irradiation but without BlocBuilder-MA; (3) upon CO2 laser irradiation with 2 wt % BlocBuilder-MA.

Using this approach in CO2 laser write experiments,
transparent polymers were produced, but the shape was not satisfying
as numerous defects could be detected on the different pieces (Figure 3), that is, with
polymerization beyond the light-irradiated areas. For pure organic
resins, the thermal effect is probably too high to really control
the spatial resolution, that is, the heat diffusion beyond the irradiated
areas also induced polymerization, leading to poorly resolved patterns.

Figure 3 Laser
write polymerization experiments upon CO2 laser
using different powers of irradiation (shape expected: a star).

To avoid this diffusion of heat into the sample,
fillers were introduced
in the monomer blend in order to dissipate the heat released during
polymerization. As a kind of fillers, high contents of silica were
selected for good heat dissipation. This type of filler is also widely
used in composite manufacturing. In particular, they are extensively
used for manufacturing tools or electronic materials.

Remarkably,
a mixture of 80/20 wt % fillers/Mix-MA resin containing
2% of BlocBuider-MA was prepared and has been successfully polymerized
in CO2 laser write experiments with excellent spatial controllability,
as shown in Figure 4. The shape is now very well resolved compared to that in Figure 3, and the polymerized
parts can be easily removed. Without BlocBuilder-MA, no polymerization
occurs, showing the crucial role of this compound to generate initiating
radicals upon CO2 laser exposure.

write experiment.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, alkoxyamines can be decomposed upon cheap and easily
accessible CO2 lasers. A benchmark methacrylate resin has
been successfully polymerized upon CO2 laser irradiation
in the presence of an alkoxyamine. The patterns obtained in the CO2 laser write experiments for clear resins are not yet well
defined. However, remarkably, the polymerization of filled samples
is highly satisfying: a well-resolved polymerization is observed.
Therefore, polymerization of composites and in particular highly filled
samples is possible using this approach. Further applications in 3D
printing experiments will be examined in the forthcoming works. The
wavelength of excitation must be selected to ensure the light penetration
in the filled samples.

Experimental Section or Computational Methods
Materials
The blend “Mix-MA”, used as
a benchmark monomer, has been prepared with 33.3 wt % of (hydroxypropyl)methacrylate,
33.3 wt % of 1,4-butanediol dimethacrylate, and 33.3 wt % of a urethane
dimethacrylate monomer, obtained from Sigma Aldrich and represented
in Scheme 2. Mix-MA
was already used in previous works.3,4 More particularly,
its viscosity is well adapted for the preparation of formulations.
In addition, interestingly, Mix-MA is not too viscous. Therefore,
oxygen inhibition occurs, and only good-performance systems can polymerize
it. BlocBuilder-MA was obtained from Arkema. tert-Butylbenzene was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.

CO2 Laser and Laser Write Experiments
A
10 W CO2 laser derived from an engraving machine was used
as the irradiation source. In laser write experiments, the engraving
machine has been modified to work with an organic liquid and filled
resins using a home-made resin tank.

ESR Experiments
A Magnettech MS400 ESR spectrometer
was used.

Polymerization Experiments
The photosensitive formulations
were deposited on a BaF2 pellet under air (thickness ≈
1.4 mm for thick samples) and irradiated with a light source. The
evolution of the C=C peak relative to the methacrylate function
was continuously followed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(JASCO FTIR 6600), as previously described, at about 6165 cm–1 for thick samples.
