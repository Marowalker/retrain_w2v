The
synthesis of analogues of hypothalamic neuropeptide growth
hormone–releasing hormone (GHRH) is an efficient strategy for
designing new therapeutic agents. Several promising synthetic agonist
and antagonist analogues of GHRH have been developed based on amino
acid mutations of the GHRH (1–29) sequence. Because structural
information on the activity of the GHRH agonists or antagonists is
limited, there is a need for more effective analytical workflows capable
of correlating the peptide sequence with biological activity. In the
present work, three GHRH agonists—MR-356, MR-406, and MR-409—and
three GHRH antagonists—MIA-602, MIA-606, and MIA-690—were
investigated to assess the role of substitutions in the amino acid
sequence on structural motifs and receptor binding affinities. The
use of high resolution trapped ion mobility spectrometry coupled to
mass spectrometry allowed the observation of a large number of peptide-specific
mobility bands (or structural motif descriptors) as a function of
the amino acid sequence and the starting solution environment. A direct
correlation was observed between the amino acid substitutions (i.e.,
basic residues and d/l-amino acids), the structural
motif descriptors, and the biological function (i.e., receptor binding
affinities of the GHRH agonists and antagonists). The simplicity,
ease, and high throughput of the proposed workflow based on the structural
motif descriptors can significantly reduce the cost and time during
screening of new synthetic peptide analogues.

1 Introduction
Growth
hormone–releasing hormone (GHRH) is a hypothalamic
peptide hormone containing 44 residues that stimulate the secretion
and release of growth hormone (GH) from the anterior pituitary gland
upon binding to its receptor (GHRH-R).1 Since the characterization of the sequence of GHRH (Figure S1a), this hypothalamic neuropeptide has
been the focus of intense studies.2,3 Biological
tests of GHRH revealed that the structural requirements for growth
hormone–stimulating activity resided in the N-terminal 1–29
residues of this peptide (Figure S1b).4 The GHRH peptide and GHRH-R are also expressed
in various normal human tissues, including breast, colon, esophagus,
kidney, liver, lung, ovary, pancreas, prostate, testis, and thymus,5−7 and in many human cancer cell lines and tumors.1,8−11 A major drawback in using native GHRH as a therapeutic agent is
its short in vivo half-life due to degradation by proteolytic enzymes.12 Understanding the action of GHRH on its target
cells is important for the development of various degradation-resistant
synthetic GHRH analogues, which may provide a promising approach for
drug design. Previous reports have shown the advantages of the synthesis
of GHRH antagonists to develop therapies for the management of diverse
cancers and other diseases.1,8,13 It has been demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of the GHRH
antagonists on the growth of various tumors are exerted in part by
an indirect endocrine mechanism through the suppression of GHRH-evoked
release of GH from the pituitary, resulting in the decrease in the
production of hepatic insulin-like growth factor I.1,8 Direct
mechanisms involved in the main antitumor effects of GHRH antagonists
appear to be based on blocking the action of autocrine GHRH on tumors.1,8 It has been also demonstrated that the GHRH antagonists inhibit
the growth of androgen-dependent and -independent human prostatic
cancers and diverse human tumors xenografted into nude mice, and reduce
the tumoral growth factors.1,14−17 In addition, the development of GHRH agonists with a prolonged half-life
has been achieved.18 Synthetic GHRH agonists
have been shown to exert direct effects on various extra-pituitary
cells/tissues.18 Recent studies have exhibited
that these analogues improve the survival and proliferation of pancreatic
β-islet cells, providing evidence of a promising pharmacological
therapy in diabetic patients.19,20 GHRH agonists also
showed a cardioprotective effect in activating myocardial repair after
a heart attack, and promote the survival of cardiac stem cells.21,22 Other findings exhibited that agonistic GHRH may have clinical use
in improving the healing of skin wounds resulting from trauma and/or
disease.23

The accumulating results
of these studies demonstrate the importance
of further synthesis of GHRH agonists and antagonists because of their
likely multiple therapeutic roles in a wide range of medical fields.
However, it is worth mentioning that to date, although the biological
activity of these analogues has been demonstrated, a direct correlation
between the amino acid sequence and their agonist/antagonist potency
has not been determined. The structural characterization of GHRH agonists
and antagonists, and the understanding of the structural motifs responsible
for a given agonist/antagonist function remain to be understood. Recent
efforts based on in silico directed evolution have attempted to link
the amino acid sequence with the biological activity as a way to develop
leading mutants.24,25 However, the main limitation
of the current in silico directed evolution algorithms is the lack
of experimental descriptors per amino acid sequence. Gas phase, post-ionization
tools based on soft ionization techniques (e.g., electrospray source
ionization (ESI)26) coupled to ion mobility
spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS-MS), which are different from
NMR- and X-ray crystallography-based structural biology studies, have
shown unique advantages in the description of peptide kinetic intermediates
under native and denaturing solution conditions.27−30

In the present study, we
took advantage of a recently developed,
but previously untested, high-resolution trapped IMS-MS technology
(TIMS-MS)31−34 to generate a high-throughput screening workflow capable of correlating
the primary and secondary structures of the GHRH analogues and their
receptor-binding affinity using descriptors of the GHRH conformational
space and response to the molecular environment. The advantage of
the ESI evaporative cooling of the solvent, leading to a freezing
of multiple stable conformations, known as the memory effect,35,36 was used to determine the correlation between the TIMS-MS structural
descriptors of the GHRH analogues and variations on the starting solution
environment. A statistical model is described to correlate the effects
of the substitutions in the amino acid sequence on the number of structural
motifs and receptor binding affinities. The performance of the workflow
was successfully evaluated using a set of three GHRH agonists—MR-356,
MR-406, and MR-409—and three GHRH antagonists—MIA-602,
MIA-606, and MIA-690 (Table 1 and Figure S1b).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural
Motif Sampling of GHRH Agonists
and Antagonists
The possibility to study kinetically trapped
intermediates of biomolecules using TIMS-MS enables the characterization
of multiple structural motifs in a single experiment and their dependence
on the molecular environment.37−39 For example, solvent conditions
can induce conformational changes, and these changes are reflected
in the number of mobility bands and the distribution of the charge
state.40,41 In the case of GHRH, the charge state distribution
and the structural motif analysis of the GHRH agonists—MR-356,
MR-406, and MR-409—and antagonists—MIA-602, MIA-606,
and MIA-690—showed a direct dependence on the molecular environment
(i.e., starting solvent condition) (Figure 1). Differences in the distribution of the
charge state with the molecular environment derive from differences
in the amino acid sequence (i.e., number of basic residues) of the
GHRH analogues due to different proton affinities. For example, the
GHRH agonists have 5 basic residues (positions 11, 12, 20, 21, and
29), whereas the GHRH antagonists have 8 or 9 basic residues (positions
2, 9, 11, 12, 20, 21, 28, 29, and 30). As a general trend, an increase
in the higher charge states is observed, when the solvent conditions
change from native to denaturing conditions, due to the exposure of
the basic residues. For example, under native conditions (pH 6.7,
10 mM NH4Ac), [M + 3H]3+ and [M + 4H]4+ species represent the most abundant charge states observed for the
GHRH agonists and antagonists, respectively (Figure 1, left panel). An increase in the concentration
of the organic content (e.g., 0–50% MeOH) showed a shift toward
higher charge states (Figure 1, left panel). The impact of the starting solvent conditions
on the relative abundance of the different structural motifs is better
addressed in the IMS distribution of the conformational space (Figure 1, right panel). For
example, major changes in the number and relative abundances of the
IMS bands are observed for the GHRH analogues during native (10 mM
NH4Ac) and denaturing (50% MeOH) conditions (Figure 1, right panel). A closer inspection
of the structural motifs dependence with the solvent conditions showed
that an increase in abundance of the larger collision cross section
(CCS, Å2) values (more extended conformations) is
observed in the denaturing conditions as compared to the native conditions
(Figure 1, right panel).

Figure 1 Left panel: typical mass spectra of the GHRH (1–29),
agonists (MR-356, MR-406, and MR-409) and antagonists (MIA-602, MIA-606,
and MIA-690) in native (10 mM NH4Ac) and denaturing (50%
MeOH) molecular environments. Right panel: total
ion mobility profiles, obtained by summation of the IMS intensity
of all the observed charge states, of GHRH (brown), MR-356 (blue),
MR-406 (magenta), MR-409 (gray), MIA-602 (green), MIA-606 (orange),
and MIA-690 (purple). The 3+, 4+, 5+, 6+, and 7+ charges states are
highlighted using a light red, light purple, light green, light blue,
and light gray background, respectively.

The structural motif space per amino acid sequence can be
further
sampled by collision-induced activation (CIA) before the TIMS-MS analysis
(Figure S2). Thus, the energy from the
collisions can allow to overcome the conformational barriers and sample
other local free energy minima not amenable by changes in the molecular
environment by varying the solvent conditions.42,43 Although ions were activated to the highest condition accessible
by the current setup, no major changes in the structural motif space
of the agonists and antagonists of GHRH (1–29) are observed
upon CIA (i.e., same number of IMS bands and relative abundance, Figure S2). We interpret these CIA-TIMS results
as that the activation energy is probably not sufficient to induce
new structural changes or interconversions in the gas phase.

2.2 TIMS-MS Tool To Elucidate the Agonistic/Antagonistic
Potency of Synthetic GHRH Analogues
The conformational space
analysis using nano-ESI-TIMS-MS resulted in multiple structural motifs
(i.e., IMS bands) for every charge state of the agonists (Figure S3) and antagonists (Figure S4) of GHRH (1–29) in the native conditions.
The CCS values for all the observed structural motifs of the GHRH
agonists and antagonists are summarized in Tables S1 and S2, respectively. A closer inspection of the structural
motif space observed for the GHRH agonists and antagonists shows a
direct correlation between the mutations and the IMS profiles (Figures S3 and S4). A simplified way to assess
the role of the substitutions in the amino acid sequence on the conformational
space can be done by building the correlation maps of the sequences
and structural motifs with a distance matrix of the receptor-binding
affinities of the agonists and antagonists of GHRH (1–29) (Figures 2 and S5).

Figure 2 Correlation maps of the (a) sequence mutation
and (b) structural
motif and distance matrix of the (c) binding affinity of the GHRH
(1–29), agonists and antagonists, in a native molecular environment.
The color scale represents the similarities between the GHRH analogues
going toward a strong correlation (red) to a poor correlation (blue).

Further inspection of the correlation
map based on the amino acid
sequence clearly identifies two major subgroups—GHRH agonists
and antagonists (Figure 2a). The clustering in two mayor groups corresponds to the relative
similarity in the sequence mutation within the agonist and antagonist
GHRH analogues studied. Molecular descriptors based on the IMS profiles
per charge state for each amino acid sequence can provide a more detailed
information on the conformational space and charge state distribution
as a function of molecular environment. For example, although similar
subgroups are observed when utilizing the structural motifs as descriptors
during the correlation analysis of the GHRH agonists and antagonists,
a more detailed information on the transcendence of a given mutation
on the structural motifs and their relative abundance is observed
(Figures 2b and S5). That is, significant differences in the
structural motifs as a function of the substitutions in the amino
acid sequence are observed, which translates into their agonist/antagonist
functions. In fact, these structural motif differences are reflected
in the distance matrix based on the binding affinity, clearly identifying
the GHRH agonists and antagonists clusters (Figure 2c). This means that different structural
motifs are probably involved in the receptor binding according to
their agonist or antagonist functions. To determine which conformation
is needed to bind to the receptor function as an agonist or antagonist,
the three GHRH agonists—MR-356, MR-406, and MR-409—and
GHRH antagonists—MIA-602, MIA-606, and MIA-690—are compared
according to their structural motifs and reported receptor-binding
affinities (Figure 2).

In the case of the GHRH agonists, the comparison between
MR-356
and MR-406 shows that the single amino acid substitution in position
29 results in large differences in structural motifs (Figures 2 and 3a,b). MR-356 has a basic C-terminal agmatine residue, implying that
the proton attachment sites are mainly localized on the three most
basic residues, Arg11, Arg20, and Agm29, mainly giving one unfolded conformation. In the case of MR-406,
the Agm29 is modified by a less basic residue, Arg29-NH-Me, implying a competition in the proton attachment site
between the basic Orn12 and Orn21 residues,
leading to an increase in the number of structural motifs. In addition,
the replacement of Agm29 with Arg29-NH-Me results
in increasing proteolytic stability, consistent with more compact
conformations. The differences in the structural motifs and their
previous reported binding affinities suggest that the receptor binding
is driven by the most intense compact structural motif of MR-406.
This conformational space is probably responsible for the improvement
in the binding affinity and therefore the agonist potency.18

Sequence differences are represented in brown and red for GHRH agonists
and antagonists, respectively. The brown and red windows highlight
the proposed structural motif region that drive the agonist and antagonist
receptor binding, respectively.

The comparison between MR-406 and MR-409 indicates that the
two
amino acid substitutions in position 2 and 8 also result in large
differences in structural motifs (Figures 2 and 3a,c). The replacement
of the l-Ala2 residue with a d-Ala2 residue allows to improve the resistance to enzymatic degradation,44,45 in agreement with the promotion of more compact structural motifs.46 In contrast to the previous case, the most intense
very compact conformation of MR-409 leads to a decrease in the receptor-binding
affinity. In addition, our group showed that the best combination
at positions 2 and 8 are d-Ala and Gln, respectively.18 As a consequence of these observations, the
structural motifs located between the most intense conformation of
MR-406 and MR-409 (highlighted in brown in Figure 3a–c) probably drive the receptor binding,
leading to an increase in the binding affinity, which defines the
potency of the agonist function.

In the case of the GHRH antagonists,
the comparison between MIA-602
and MIA-606 shows that the single amino acid substitution in position
30 results in large differences in structural motifs (Figures 2 and 3d,e). This observation suggests that the additional basic Agm30 residue of MIA-606 plays a major role in the structural
motifs by promoting more extended structures than those observed for
MIA-602. That is, the addition of a basic residue results in an increase
in the intramolecular Coulombic repulsion, which, combined with the
conformational flexibility of the peptide, favors more extended structural
motifs. In addition, MIA-602 and MIA-606, which are known to exert
a potent antagonist function,47,48 do not share common
bands in the most compact and extended structural motifs, suggesting
that these conformations are probably not involved in the binding
receptor (Figure 3d,e).
These differences in the structural motifs, combined with their previous
reported receptor-binding affinities, enable us to determine a CCS
region (highlighted in red in Figure 3d–f) that probably drives the receptor binding
and is therefore responsible for the increase in the antagonist potency.
In addition, MIA-602 has a stronger binding affinity to the GHRH receptor
than MIA-606 as previously described.48 As a consequence, this observation can be translated in the structural
motifs by the presence of a more intense extended conformation for
MIA-606 in the proposed CCS region, as compared to the most intense
IMS band of MIA-602 (Figure 3d,e). The insertion of the basic Agm30 residue
in MIA-606 results in an increase in the intramolecular Coulombic
repulsion in the gas phase when protonated, which typically results
in a more open conformation (higher CCS). In a solution, this basic
residue will have more sensitivity to the solution condition, making
it less likely to behave as the original GHRH and therefore significantly
changing (decreasing, in this case, the antagonist potency) the binding
affinity to the GHRH receptor.47,48

The comparison
between MIA-602 and MIA-690 displays a very strong
correlation in both sequences and structural motifs, indicating that
the two amino acid substitutions in positions 6 and 10 do not result
in major changes in structural motifs (Figures 2 and 3d,f). This can
be explained by the nature of the amino acid substitution that presents
similar chemical structures (Figure S6).
Despite the similarity of structural motifs, MIA-602 displays a significantly
better binding affinity to the GHRH receptor than MIA-690.47,48 As in the case of MIA-606, this could be explain by the presence
of a slightly more intense extended structure for MIA-690 in the proposed
CCS region, as compared to the most intense IMS band of MIA-602 (Figure 3d,f). In addition,
the increase in the number and intensity of the most compact structural
motifs probably plays a role in the receptor-binding affinity by competing
with the conformation involved in the receptor binding. As a consequence
of these observations, we propose that the structural motif region
(highlighted in red in Figure 3d–f) of the GHRH antagonists probably drives the receptor
binding, leading to an increase in the binding affinity, which defines
the potency of the antagonist function. These results suggest that
the GHRH agonists and antagonists adopt very different conformations,
where compact structures are needed to bind to the receptor as an
agonist function, whereas more extended conformations are required
for an antagonist function.

3 Conclusions
Herein, a high-throughput workflow was developed and evaluated
for the assessment of the influence of the substitutions in the amino
acid sequence on the potential biological activity on the agonist/antagonist
potency of GHRH analogues based on the peptides conformational space.
This study showcases the power of IMS bands as potential descriptors
of biological active states for the case of GHRH analogue receptor-binding
affinities: agonist and antagonist. The present results reveal that
the molecular environment (e.g., starting solvent conditions) and
the amino acid substitution plays a significant role in the conformational
space of the GHRH analogues, as reflected by the substantial changes
in the number of IMS bands and their distribution. The studied correlations
suggest that more compact structures are likely to present an agonist
function, whereas more extended conformations are likely to have an
antagonist function.

The high-throughput of the proposed screening
workflow based on
TIMS-MS permits the determination of characteristic structural motif
descriptors of agonistic or antagonistic GHRH potencies by only requiring
a minute amount of material and a short analysis time (millisecond
time scale) as compared to traditional screening strategies (e.g.,
NMR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blot) and biological
activity assays. However, the latest strategies are ultimately required
and complementary to the described approach because the structural
motif descriptors generated by TIMS-MS correspond to the average momentum
transfer CCS.

Although the basis of the correlation between
primary sequence,
conformational space, and biological activity was illustrated for
the case of three GHRH antagonist and three agonist, further developments
with larger training synthetic peptides sets can lead to better predictions
of point mutations utilizing the structural motif descriptors as a
fast screening step. This works provides a stepping stone toward the
elucidation of the effect of the amino acid sequence on the structural
motif space and receptor-binding affinity of synthetic peptides.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Reagents
The GHRH agonists—MR-356,
MR-406, and MR-409—and GHRH antagonists—MIA-602, MIA-606,
and MIA-690—were synthesized by R.C. and W.S. in the laboratory
of one of us (A.V.S.) using the solid-phase method and purified by
reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography as previously
reported.18,47,49 Solutions
were prepared at a final concentration of 5 μM in 10 mM ammonium
acetate (NH4Ac) for native conditions, and in 50:50 (v/v)
water/methanol (H2O/MeOH) for denaturing conditions. Low-concentration
Tuning Mix calibration standard (TuneMix, G24221A) was purchased from
Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA). Details on the Tuning Mix
structures is described elsewhere.33

4.2 TIMS-MS Experiments
Ion mobility
experiments were performed on a custom-built nano-ESI-TIMS coupled
to an Impact Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA).31,32 The TIMS unit is run by custom software in LabView (National Instruments)
synchronized with the MS platform controls.31 Sample aliquots (10 μL) were loaded in a pulled-tip capillary
and sprayed at 1200 V. Details regarding the TIMS operation and specifics
compared to traditional IMS can be found elsewhere.31,32 Briefly, the ion mobility separation in a TIMS device is based on
holding the ions stationary using an electric field (E) against a moving buffer gas.50 The TIMS
separation depends on the gas flow velocity (vg), elution voltage (Velution),
ramp time (tramp), and base voltage (Vout).32,50 The reduced mobility, K0, is defined by 1  The constant A can be determined
using calibration standards (Tuning Mix) of known reduced mobilities
(K0 of 1.013, 0.835, and 0.740 cm2/(V s) for respective m/z 622, 922, and 1222).33 In the TIMS operation,
multiple isomers/conformers are trapped simultaneously at different E values resulting from a voltage gradient applied across
the IMS tunnel region. After thermalization, isomers/conformers are
eluted by decreasing the electric field in stepwise decrements. Each
isomer/conformer eluting from the TIMS cell can be described by a
characteristic voltage (Velution). In
a TIMS device, the total analysis time (tT) can be described as 2  where ttrap is
the thermalization/trapping time, tof is
the time after the ion mobility separation, and Vramp and tramp are the voltage
range and time required to vary the electric field, respectively.
The elution voltage can be experimentally determined by varying the
ramp time for a constant ramp voltage. A linear dependence of tT with tramp for
all the investigated m/z was obtained
as describe elsewhere.33 From the slope
and the intercept of this graph, the mobility values can be determined
using the calibration constant A determined with
the Tuning Mix component. The measured mobilities were converted into
collision cross sections (CCS, Å2) using the Mason–Schamp
equation 3  where q is the ion charge, kB is the Boltzmann constant, N is the gas number density, m is the ion mass, and M is the gas molecule mass.50,3 The TIMS separation
was carried out using nitrogen (N2) at ambient temperature
(T) with vg set by the
pressure difference between the funnel entrance (P1 = 2.6 mbar) and exit (P2 = 1.1 mbar, Figure S7). An radio frequency
voltage of 200 Vpp at 880 kHz was applied to all the electrodes.
Collision-induced activation experiments were performed before the
TIMS-MS by increasing the voltage between the capillary outlet (Vcap: 40–180 V), deflector plate (Vdef: 60–200 V), and funnel entrance (Vfun: 0–140 V) in 10 V steps.
