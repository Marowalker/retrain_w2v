A nondestructive
one-step approach was applied for grafting biocide-free
monodispersed silica nanoparticles (SNPs) with a diameter of 30 ±
10 nm on polystyrene, polyethylene, and polyvinyl chloride surfaces.
The prepared surfaces were comprehensively characterized using spectroscopic
(Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflection, ultraviolet–visible,
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and microscopic (high-resolution
scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy) methods.
The modified polymers were found to maintain their original mechanical
and physical properties, while their nanoroughness on the other hand
had risen by 1.6–2.7 times because of SNP grafting. The SNP-grafted
surfaces displayed anti-biofouling properties, resulting in a significant
reduction in the attached Gram-positive Bacillus licheniformis or Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria compared to their nongrafted counterparts. Confocal laser
scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy studies have
confirmed that bacterial cells could not successfully adhere onto
the SNP-grafted polymer films regardless of the polymer type, and
their biofilm formation was therefore damaged. The presented facile
and straightforward protocol allows eliminating the need for biocidal
agents and resorts to grafted nanosilica instead. This strategy may
serve as a feasible and safe platform for the development of sustainable
anti-biofouling surfaces in biomedical devices; food, water, and air
treatment systems; and industrial equipment.

Introduction
The
development of safe and effective methods to prevent microbial
fouling and biofilm formation is of substantial environmental, economic,
and public health interest. Microorganisms attached to the surfaces
of the medical devices, filters, air conditioners, and food and water
treatment systems provide a persistent source of infection.1,2 Grafting biocidal agents on material surfaces is an effective method
that allows reducing bacterial contamination significantly.3−5 However, biocides are associated with many disadvantages at a local
and global scale.6 Their environmental
contamination,7 health risks,8 and plausible aid in the development of bacterial
resistance9 have all raised concerns. These
reasons emphasize the demand to find methods that prevent the formation
of bacterial fouling without the use of biocides. Antiadhesive materials
that prevent or limit bacterial contact with surfaces may offer a
sustainable solution for the prevention of biofouling without polluting
the environment with antimicrobial agents and the promotion of bacterial
resistance mechanisms.3,10,11 Numerous approaches that allow the reduction of microbial adhesion
have been reported. These include plasma deposition of polyoxazoline
thin films that can provide the coated surfaces with biopassivity12 and polymer brushes that act as antiadhesive
coatings in an array of applications.13 Other approaches include regulating the hydrophobicity of the surface
in order to prevent bacterial adhesion14 and even UV activating it to switch its physical properties and
control its topography and wettability, different variables in bacterial
adhesion and growth.15 Numerous studies
have taught us about the importance of surface roughness and topography,
and these paramount physical traits play a role in surface interactions
with various biomolecules. Surface roughness adjustments can affect
the hydrodynamic performance of antifouling coatings and must therefore
be accounted for in the design of novel approaches for biofouling
prevention.16 The nanotopographical landscape
of any given surface was also found to have crucial implications in
terms of possible settlements of bacterial colonies and their response
to it.17 This ongoing line of research
is currently directed toward lotus-like self-cleaning surfaces18 and flow-regulating biomimetic Janus membranes,19 all at the attempt of altering surface nanoproperties,
transitioning from detrimental biocide use.

Silica is a biocompatible
and biodegradable material that plays
an important role in the functions of many living organisms.20 Silica nanoparticles (SNPs) were reported to
provide numerous advanced properties21 and
are applicatively used in many exciting avenues such as magnetic hyperthermia,
photothermal therapy,22 resins,23 and exosome-like ultrasound contrast agents.24 The propensity of SNPs to be incorporated in
various formulations for the prevention of bacterial growth has been
studied to great lengths, including synergistic and multiple bioactive
effects,25 as well as their utilization
as a delivery platform for biocidal agents in antimicrobial and anti-biofilm
research.26−28 In addition, organofunctional silanes were found
to modify the surface energy and wettability that were expressed in
reduced bacterial adhesion.29 The ability
of bare SNPs to prevent biofouling by affecting the variable degrees
of hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity is practically unexplored. We
are aware of two studies who mentioned this issue in the context of
biomedical effects without studying the chemical aspects of this phenomenon.30,31

In the current study, we report a one-step grafting of the
in situ
prepared SNPs on the surfaces of commonly used polymers such as polyethylene
(PE), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The spectroscopic,
microscopic, physical, structural, and optical properties of the modified
polymer films were studied. The bare SNP-grafted surfaces have successfully
repelled Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria without biocidal
agents, offering a valuable green alternative that can help avoid
the bacterial resistance effect as well as cut down on human health
risks and environmental contamination.

Results and Discussion
Si NP
Grafting and Modified Polymer Characterizations
PE, PS, and
PVC are relatively inert polymers and usually require
substantial oxidizing agents or physical treatment for their activation.32 Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was previously
reported to serve as a SiO2 precursor for the formation
of Si NPs on parylene C polymers.33 In
this work, we have used TEOS as a precursor for a one-step process
to graft SNPs on PE, PS, and PVC surfaces using the sol–gel
technique. Surfaces were precleaned in absolute EtOH prior to SNP
grafting. The process, which had originated by Stöber et al.,34 was modified and performed according to Binyamini
et al.33 As the TEOS molecules are drawn
to the polymeric surfaces, their interactions with them are based
on a noncovalent hydrophobic affinity. Following a base-catalyzed
cleavage process, a two-dimensional poly (Si–OH) layer is ultimately
formed, making up the overall surface coating (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Preparation of SNP-Grafted Polymers
Utilizing TEOS as a Precursor
of SNPs
High-resolution scanning
electron microscopy (HR-SEM) micrographs
of the SNP-grafted PE, PS, and PVC polymer surfaces have confirmed
SNP deposition. The deposited SNP demonstrated highly homogeneous
distribution on PVC. PE and PS were found to be overlied with the
dense occasionally cracked SNP cover. The SNP-grafted films demonstrated
a remarkable stability when treated by multiple rigorous sonication
(overall 30 min). It can be seen on the HR-SEM micrographs that after
this sonication treatment, no significant changes in the morphology
of the grafted polymer surfaces were observed (Figure 1).

Figure 1 HR-SEM images of SNP-grafted PE (a,b), PS (c,d),
and PVC (e,f)
films before (a,c,e) and after (b,d,f) rigorous sonication.

The average diameter for all the
SNPs was found to be ∼30
nm with a narrow size distribution of ±10 nm. This similar NP
size on top of the different polymers has allowed us to assume that
they were created through a similar mechanism, involving hydrophobic
interactions with the tripodal ethoxy groups of TEOS.26 As the deposited SNPs were inspected using atomic force
microscopy (AFM), they were found to have increased the overall roughness
of the surfaces (Figure 2).

Figure 2 AFM imaging of the original and SNP-grafted PE (a,b), PS (c,d),
and PVC (e,f), respectively, performed using a tapping mode (at a
scan rate of 1.0 Hz with a fixed resolution of 512 × 512 data
points).

Rq values have shown to rise from 8.84
to 14.00 nm (for original and SNP-grafted PE surfaces, respectively)
and from 3.56 to 8.76 nm (for original and SNP-grafted PVC surfaces,
respectively). However, the most pronounced increase was measured
for the PS surfaces, where the Rq values
have risen from 3.96 to 11.00 nm (for original and SNP-grafted PS
surfaces, respectively). The high-resolution Si 2p spectra for the
modified polymers performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
demonstrated the presence of a Si–O peak at the 102.5–103
eV area. The relatively broad peak pattern in the PE–SNPs films
may be attributed to the charging phenomenon (Figure 3a).35

Figure 3 (a) High-resolution
Si 2p XPS peaks of SNP-grafted PE, PS, and
PVC. (b–d) Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared
(ATR–FTIR) spectra of original PS, PE, and PVC and subtracted
spectra of SNP-grafted PS, PE and PVC, respectively. (e–g)
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) graphs of original and SNP-grafted
PE, PS and PVC, respectively (sample weights were normalized to 10
mg).

The ATR–FTIR subtractive
spectra of the original and SNP-grafted
PE and PVC surfaces revealed the characteristic peak of SNPs (Si–O–Si
siloxane bond) at 1100 cm–1. Also, the peaks at
2920 and 2850 cm–1 assigned to alkane bands have
decreased as the surface-grafted SNPs concealed those groups. An interesting
phenomenon was observed while exploring the spectra for the SNP-grafted
PS surfaces. Their C–C bond peaks (1300 cm–1) were diminished, while the aromatic peaks for C=C–C
(1500 cm–1) did not decrease, allowing us to assume
that SNPs prefer to be deposited on aliphatic rather than on aromatic
areas because TEOS better forms hydrophobic interactions with aliphatic
groups.

TGA showed that SNP-grafted PE and PS films have similar
degradation
patterns compared to their original forms with smaller weight losses
across the temperature gradient (97.6 vs 97.07 and 99.52 vs 99.17%
for PE and PS, and their SNP-grafted analogues, correspondingly).
It was therefore found that PE films contain 0.615% SNPs on their
surface, while PS contained only 0.38% SNPs (the weight loss of the
bare SNPs at the same conditions was measured in a separate experiment
and taken into account, data not shown). The PVC decomposition involved
the dehydrochlorination and cyclization of conjugated polyene sequences.36 It can be seen that when grafting SNPs, the
dehydrochlorination initial temperature decreased from 260 to 240
°C, and the initial decomposition of the second step increased
from 465 to 480 °C. These results are in correlation with the
previously reported evidence that NPs catalyze PVC dehydrochlorination
and enhance chain stability in the second stage.37 However, the mechanism for this process is unclear. From
the weight loss (82.94 vs 80.22% for PVC- and SNP-grafted PVC, respectively),
it was calculated that the SNP-grafted PVC contained approximately
3.02% SNPs (Figure 3e–g). SNP-grafted films were also tested for their mechanical
properties by measuring Young’s modulus (YM) and elongation
at break (EB) (Table 1). It can be seen that grafting SNPs had no significant effects on
the mechanical properties of the modified films. These observations
are notable for the sustainability and applicability of the suggested
method because they show that the presented modification is undisruptive
for the bulk polymer features. Interestingly, water contact angles
(WCAs) for the original and SNP-grafted polymers were also found to
be similar, suggesting that the anti-biofouling activity described
later on is not a result of dramatic changes in the hydrophobicity.

Anti-Biofouling Activity
The SNP-grafted
polymers were
exposed to human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa(38) and food spoilage Bacillus
licheniformis(39) bacteria
for 30 min, and bacterial cell attachment was quantified using the
colony-forming unit (CFU) method (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Effect of SNP-grafted surfaces on P. aeruginosa and B. licheniformis accumulation.
The CFU counts of the bacteria accumulated on the SNP-grafted surface
were normalized following the bacterial counts on the uncoated surfaces.
The data present an average of two independent biological experiments,
each one performed in triplicates.

The tested bacteria possess a notable biofilm formation ability
and therefore are very problematic for biomedical and water- or food-contacting
surfaces. The presence of SNPs has notably reduced the surface accumulation
of B. licheniformis. The accumulation
of P. aeruginosa was also reduced,
however in a less notable manner.

The confocal laser scanning
microscopy (CLSM) images have confirmed
that bacterial cells could not successfully form a biofilm onto the
SNP-grafted polymer films. Figure 5a shows that the SNP-grafted polymer surfaces demonstrate
a notable anti-biofouling capability, following their exposure to
bacteria for 24 h. These images show live bacterial cells stained
green and dead cells with a red stain, hence visually describing that
the SNP-treated surfaces did not notably harm the bacterial viability.
These results also convey the fact that using SNPs as a grafting material
on the polymer surfaces can help endow these surfaces with anti-biofouling
properties without having to resort to biocidal agents.

original (left panel) and SNP-grafted (right panel) substrates.
(a) Incubation periods prior to imaging lasted 24 h at 37 °C.
(b) Incubation periods prior to imaging lasted 6 days at 37 °C.
Live cells are stained green, and dead cells are stained red. Scale
bars are 50 μm.

Next, we examined the inhibitory capacity of the developed
surfaces
during the long-term biofilm formation by B. licheniformis and by P. aeruginosa. All the SNP-grafted
surfaces demonstrated a strong inhibition of biofilm formation throughout
the 6 days of incubation as observed by the CLSM (Figure 5b). A fascinating finding was
that the inhibition of mature (6 day) biofilm formation was more marked
than that of young (24 h) biofilm. This phenomenon might be explained
by the possible damage caused by the SNP-grafted surfaces to the biofilm
maturation process (a critical step during biofilm formation), with
a consequent inability of the bacteria to aggregate and form a confluent
and mature biofilm, even if some initial adhesion (as seen following
24 h of incubation) occurred.

Interestingly, SEM investigations
have also shown that SNPs successfully
fortify the surface inaptitude for bacterial attachment, regardless
of the polymer type. It can be seen that SNP-grafted surfaces prevent
biofilm formation when compared to the original silica-free surfaces
(Figure 6).

Figure 6 SEM images
of the original (right) and SNP-grafted (left) films
incubated with B. licheniformis for
one day at 37 °C.

The attachment of bacteria onto biocidal-free surfaces can
be prevented
by various physicochemical influences that include surface energy,
charge, and topography.40,41 Numerous studies demonstrated
a correlation between surface topography and biofilm formation, and
it is known that surface topology plays an essential role in the bacterial
attachment process.42 However, the predictions
whether a surface would promote or suppress bacterial attachment are
difficult. Gaikwad et al., who have polished tooth surfaces with nanoparticulate
silica, witnessed that these surfaces were markedly easier to wash
for bacterial residues because of poorer adhesion.30 Cousins et al. have experimented with spherical Si NPs
as a way to control the growth of Candida albicans and concluded that the inhibited development was caused by surface
topography.31 Although it is possible that
differences in protein absorption could explain (at least partially)
the differences in bacterial adhesion, in our experiment, we did not
find the significant difference between the protein attachment onto
original and SNP-grafted surfaces following exposure to the bacterial
growth medium (data not shown).

In this study, the obtained
results allow to suggest that the examined
SNP-grafted polymers are nontoxic to the bacteria, and their anti-biofouling
action can thus be attributed to their influence on the surface topography.43 The presented findings point to the potential
feasibility of using SNP grafting as a facile biocide-free approach
for resisting microbial attachment on various material surfaces. Although
SNP grafting does not affect the polymer properties on a macroscopic
level (WCA and mechanical properties), it does introduce nanoscale
changes as was demonstrated by AFM analyses. These changes in the
surface landscape may contribute to avoiding cellular attachment to
the polymer surface.

Conclusions
A series of widely used
commercial polymers were in situ grafted
with SNPs from a TEOS precursor, and the new coating layer endowed
them with anti-biofouling properties. It was found that the SNPs were
more predominantly dispersed in aliphatic rather than aromatic regions
of the surfaces, which helped support the importance of hydrophobic
interactions between the coated polymers and the cell surfaces. The
grafted polymers notably decreased bacterial adhesion with no notable
killing activity, and this ability can allow the prevention of biofouling
without promoting bacterial resistance. This study has therefore shown
that material surfaces can be treated with a simple and available
protocol for disrupting biofilm formation without the use of biocidal
agents. These findings may serve as a feasible platform for the formation
of sustainable anti-biofouling materials and their applications in
various fields that face bacterial fouling associated problems and
do not wish to use biocidal agents.

Experimental Section
Materials
Low-weight additive-free PE was kindly donated
by Ginegar Plastic Products Ltd (Israel). The following analytical-grade
chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used as received:
PS powder, PVC powder, TEOS (99.999% purity), and 28 v/v % aqueous
NH4OH (99.99% purity). Ethanol abs. of AR grade was purchased
from Gadot (Israel) and used without further purification. LB broth
and LB agar were purchased from Difco (MD, USA) and used without further
treatment.

Methods
Grafting SNPs onto a Polymer
Film Surface
Polymer films
(4 × 2 cm) (PE, PVC, or PS), precleaned in an ultrasonic bath
(Elmasonic S 30 ultrasonic bath, 37 kHz at full-power irradiation,
15 min in EtOH), were placed in a reaction vessel containing 30 mL
of EtOH. TEOS [1.89 mL (8.4 mmol)] was inserted, and the reaction
vessel was shaken for 15 min in order to prevent the formation of
SNPs by the TEOS precursor. Aqueous NH4OH (1.6 mL, 28 w/w
% in H2O) was then added to induce SNP growth on the polymeric
surfaces. The reaction was performed at room temperature for 24 h
under constant agitation (orbital shaker). The resulting modified
film was sonicated with EtOH for 1 min to remove physically adsorbed
SNPs. Next, the obtained films were left to air-dry before characterization
and further processing.

Stability Test
The grafted SNP polymer
films (PE, PVC,
or PS) were sonicated three times with EtOH for 10 min using an Elmasonic
S 30 ultrasonic bath, 37 kHz at full power irradiation (overall 30
min of sonication), and then were left to air-dry. ATR–FTIR
spectra (data not shown) and HR-SEM images of these polymer films
were taken to examine the stability of the SNPs on the polymer surfaces.

Characterizations
HR-SEM analysis was performed using
a field emission scanning electron microscope model Mira-Tescan. Each
sample was fixed onto a stub with a carbon adhesive tape and Pd/Au-sputtered
(40 mA, 30 s) before its analysis.

WCAs of the modified and
original polymers were obtained using the goniometer Kruss, model
FM40 easy drop (Germany), with a drop size of 10 μL of deionized
water.

XPS measurements were carried out with a Kratos AXIS
ULTRA system,
using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV) at 75 W and detection pass energies ranging
between 40 and 80 eV. A low-energy electron flood gun was applied
for the charge neutralization. Curve-fitting analysis was based on
linear or Shirley background subtraction and application of Gaussian–Lorentzian
line shapes.

ATR–FTIR spectroscopy was performed using
a Thermo Scientific
Nicolet iS5 FTIR spectrometer. Films were subjected to 32 scans at
a 4 cm–1 resolution before and after SNP grafting.
The obtained bare polymer film spectra were subtracted from the SNP
spectra where they were grafted using the Thermo Scientific OMNIC
software.

TGA of the polymer films was measured with a PerkinElmer
Pyris
1 TGA instrument under N2 (50 mL/min) at a heating rate
of 10 °C/min before and after SNP grafting. Weight loss curves
were recorded from room temperature to 800 °C for a single specimen
from each polymer treatment.

AFM topographic imaging was performed
using an Innova Atomic Force
Microscope with a NanoDrive Controller (Bruker, California) operating
in a tapping mode, in air, at room temperature. Surface images with
a scan rate of 1.0 Hz were acquired at a fixed resolution of 512 ×
512 data points. Bruker 0.01–0.025 Ω cm antimony (n)-doped
silicon tips (model: RTESPA-CP) were used. The roughness parameter
such as the root mean square (Rq) was
calculated for scanned areas of 10 × 10 μm using the NanoScope
Analysis software. AFM images and roughness calculations were obtained
for different sample places, and the most typical areas are presented.

The mechanical properties of the polymer films [YM and percent
of EB (PE)] were determined using an Instron 3345 instrument with
an Instron force transducer load cell (Norwood, MA, USA). Tests were
performed at a speed of 3 mm/s. PE was calculated by dividing the
extension at the moment of rupture by the initial gauge length of
the samples and multiplying by 100 and is expressed in percentage.
YM was determined by the ratio of the stress along an axis over the
strain along that axis in the range of stress and is expressed in
megapascal. All measurements were performed in triplicate for each
film type.

Bacteriology
Anti-Biofouling Activity
Assay
The generated films
were sterilized with ethanol (70 v/v % in deionized water) and placed
into a sterile 12-well PS plate. Around 10 μL of Gram-positive B. licheniformis (B. licheniformis) s12744 wild-type strain suspension grown
in the lysogeny broth (LB; 10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 5 g NaCl
per liter) or 10 μL of Gram-negative P. aeruginosa PA14 (P. aeruginosa) wild-type strain
suspension grown in LB to a stationary phase was spotted onto the
coated substrates and incubated for ∼30 min at 37 °C to
allow initial bacterial adhesion onto the surfaces. Next, 3 mL of
fresh tryptic soy broth with a 0.5% yeast (TSB; 17 g of pancreatic
digest of casein, 3 g of papaic digest of soybean, 2.5 g of dextrose,
5 g of sodium chloride, and 2.5 g of dipotassium phosphate per liter)
medium was added to the plates with B. licheniformis or 3 mL of fresh LB to the plates with P. aeruginosa and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Following a washing procedure
for the substrates with distilled water, the adhered bacterial cells
were swabbed and plated on the LB agar plates for CFU quantitation.
The swab and the surface were inserted into 1 mL of sterile water
(into a 15 mL plastic tube) and vortexed for 30 s. After overnight
incubation at 37 °C, the CFUs of viable bacteria were quantified
similarly as described recently.45

CLSM
Bacteria Imaging
To visualize the surface-adhered P. aeruginosa and B. licheniformis, the bacterial cells were grown on the original (control) and SNP-grafted
polymer surfaces for either 24 h or 6 days at 37 °C in an appropriate
growth medium and then stained using a FilmTracerTM LIVE/DEAD Biofilm
Viability Kit (Molecular Probes) as described recently.46 Stained samples were visualized with an Olympus
IX81 confocal laser scanning microscope (Japan). Live cells were stained
green and dead cells were stained red. The fluorescence emission of
the stained samples was measured using an Olympus IX81 CLSM equipped
with 488 nm argon ion and 543 nm helium–neon lasers.47

SEM Bacteria Imaging
The polymer
films that had been
incubated with B. licheniformis for
1 day were also incubated with glutaraldehyde and paraformaldehyde
(Karnovsky fixative) for 2 h. Following these incubations, the samples
were washed twice with a phosphate buffer saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+. The samples were then sequentially washed with
the H2O/EtOH solution (with an elevation concentration
of EtOH from 20 to 100%) to dehydrate them. They were then dried by
a critical point drier, followed by a platinum/gold sputtering. The
films were examined using a benchtop SEM JEOL JCM-6000PLUS NeoScope
at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV.
