Ti-doped ZnO thin films were obtained
with the aim of tailoring
ZnO film bioadhesiveness and making the optoelectronic properties
of ZnO materials transferable to biological environments. The films
were prepared on silicon substrates by sol–gel spin-coating
and subsequent annealing. A Ti–O segregation limits the ZnO
crystallite growth and creates a buffer out-layer. Consequently, the
Ti-doped ZnO presents slightly increased resistivity, which remains
in the order of 10–3 Ω·cm. The strong
biochemical interference of Zn2+ ions released from pure
ZnO surfaces was evidenced by culturing Staphylococcus
epidermidis with and without the Zn2+ coupling
agent clioquinol. The Ti-doped ZnO surfaces showed a considerable
increase of bacterial viability with respect to pure ZnO. Cell adhesion
was assayed with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Although hMSCs
find difficulties to adhere to the pure ZnO surface, they progressively
expand on the surface of ZnO when the Ti doping is increased. A preliminary
microdevice has been built on the Si substrate with a ZnO film doped
with 5% Ti. A one-dimensional micropattern with a zigzag structure
shows the preference of hMSCs for adhesion on Ti-doped ZnO with respect
to Si. The induced contrast of surface tension further induces a cell
polarization effect on hMSCs. It is suggested that the presence of
Ti–O covalent bonding on the doped surfaces provides a much
more stable ground for bioadhesion. Such fouling behavior suggests
an influence of Ti doping on film bioadhesiveness and sets the starting
point for the selection of optimal materials for implantable optoelectronic
devices.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
long trajectory of ZnO within advanced sensing and actuating
structures and the oligomineral nature of the degradation product
Zn2+ invites to applications of this material in implantable
devices.1 In fact, this material is known
for its versatile properties (photostable, nontoxic, inexpensive,
and abundant).2 In appropriate conditions,
ZnO is a transparent semiconductor presenting high conductivity with
a wide spectrum of optoelectronic applications (light-emitting diodes,
photodetectors, or photovoltaic cells) in which ZnO is used mostly
as a transparent conductive oxide (TCO).3,4 ZnO doping
with Al, Ga, In, Ti, Zr, and B5−8 has been studied to improve the ZnO performance as
a TCO. Very often, the doping strategies seek high electron mobilities
to provide alternative materials to In:SnO2 (ITO).9 Alternatively to doping, the formation of nanocomposites
allows establishing a dual electronic and optical role to ZnO-based
films.10

The advances in nanotechnology
are expanding the applications of
ZnO to the biomedical field. Doping ZnO with different elements is
in fact useful for cellular imaging.11 ZnO
photoluminescent nanoparticles can be doped with Co, Cu, or Ni and
stabilized in aqueous colloidal solutions.12 Relevantly, selected ZnO nanoparticles are able to penetrate into
the cell nucleus, which opens imaging possibilities and potential
genotoxic activity against cancer cells.13 Additionally, ZnO nanomaterials are being employed in the development
of drug delivery systems exploiting engineered surface chemistry and
large surface areas.14 Especially, ZnO
has excellent properties for biosensing, such as strong adsorption
capability and high isoelectric point, which allow detection of the
adsorption of certain proteins, enzymes, and antibodies.15 The synthesis of ZnO nanostructures opens its
use to nonenzymatic biosensor systems16 and self-powered nanosensors.17 In other
applications, ZnO nanowires have been exploited as biomedical piezoelectric
devices. However, the biomedical applications of ZnO are drastically
limited by its intrinsic solubility, which shortens the stability
and lifetime of devices in cell culture conditions.18,19

Outstandingly, the previously mentioned use of ZnO structures
for
self-powering devices extends the use of ZnO out of the biomedical
context to the emerging field of bio-based power sources and artificial
leaves. In fact, the role of TCOs in biophotovoltaic systems has been
already put in relevance underlining the complexity for separation
of photogenerated centers after surface immobilization.20 Relevantly, a configuration of ZnO nanowires
has already been proposed in a “bio-hybrid solar cell”.21 All these reports point to an increasing demand
of ZnO-based TCOs in biological environments and to the need of a
prospective materials research in bioengineered TCOs.

In this
paper, we propose the synthesis of Ti-doped ZnO thin films
with different Ti contents in order to regulate the surface bioadhesiveness
in vitro. Ti oxides present a covalent character that can be used
to compensate the strong ionic character of ZnO and compensate its
exacerbated solubility in alkaline solutions at 37 °C. We propose
that this process can be used to tune its physical properties and
most relevantly its biofouling properties. The effects of Ti doping
on the microstructure, surface properties, and conductivity of the
films are studied in detail prior to the in vitro analysis of the
bioadhesiveness of the surfaces at the bacterial and human cell level.
To evaluate their potential for integration in biomedical devices,
a microdevice application is demonstrated by applying a photolithographic
sequence to selected Ti-doped ZnO films and observing the response
of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs).

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Microstructural Characterization
The ZnO thin films with different annealing treatments (400 and
600
°C) and Ti doping levels (from 0.1 to 5% Ti) were analyzed by
X-ray diffraction (XRD). The corresponding diffractograms are presented
in Figure 1a. The samples
were all polycrystalline independently of the annealing temperature
and doping level. All the samples fitted well the wurtzite structure,
labeled with appropriate Miller indices on the diffractogram. It could
be observed that the increase of the annealing temperature has a positive
effect on the growth of crystallite size, with higher intensity/width
ratios for the diffraction peaks in the 600 °C annealed sample,
at an equivalent doping level.

Figure 1 (a) X-ray diffractograms for ZnO:Ti films
with doping levels of
0.1, 0.5, 1, and 5% Ti with respect to Zn (from top to bottom) annealed
at 400 °C (top set) and 600 °C (bottom set). Miller indices
according to the ZnO wurtzite phase. FE-SEM perspective view micrographs
and AFM 500 × 500 nm2 topography images (insets) of
ZnO samples with 5% Ti after annealing at 400 (b) and 600 °C
(c) (the z-scale in the AFM images is 25 nm).

In fact, it is significant that
all the ZnO:Ti thin films which
have been annealed at 600 °C exhibit a dominant (002) peak, although
according to the reference diffraction patterns, the (101) plane should
be the most intense. Consequently, (002) appears as a preferential
direction of growth and orientation of ZnO thin films. High temperatures
of 600 °C further favor this preferential growth.

The best
defined diffraction peaks of hexagonal ZnO correspond
to the lowest Ti doping levels of 0.1%. In fact, as the Ti content
increases, the diffraction peaks loose resolution and suffer a peak
shift, as predicted by Vegard’s law. Excess Ti induces point
defects and consequently tensions within the ZnO structure in view
of the coordination and lattice mismatch between the two potential
final structures of a solid solution (considering wurtzite for ZnO
and anatase for TiO2). The increase of Ti % also affects
the preferential growth along (002). Although low Ti % leads to a
clear preferential growth [note relative intensities of (002) and
(100) peaks of 4:1 for 0.1% Ti sample], this effect is drastically
reduced after Ti enrichment [intensities of (002) and (100) peaks
of 7:3 for 5% Ti sample].

The effect of Ti doping level and
annealing temperature had a direct
effect in the average crystallite size considering the preferential
growth direction, as calculated by applying a Lorentzian fitting to
the (002) peak and using the best fit parameters into Scherrer’s
formula.22Figure S1 reveals that the mean crystallite size in the (002) preferential
direction remains within the 10–40 nm range and decreases when
the amount of Ti increases in the sample. Additionally, it increases
with the annealing temperature of the samples.

Relevantly, this
microstructural effect of doping and annealing
also influences the final surface topography of the film. Figure 1b,c corresponds to
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) cross-sectional
micrographs and atomic force microscopy (AFM) surface topography images
from the surfaces of ZnO doped with 5% Ti annealed at 400 and 600
°C, respectively. The films reach an overall thickness of 180
and 160 nm for 400 and 600 °C annealing, respectively, which
confirms the continuous condensation effect of annealing temperature
on sol–gel-deposited films. It can be noted that the mean grain
size is in the same order of magnitude as the crystallite size estimated
by XRD (ca. 15 and 50 nm for 400 and 600 °C annealing, respectively),
confirming the effect of the annealing temperature on the microstructure.
Additionally, the emphasized grain growth activated at 600 °C
and the crystallite growth constrictions due to high doping level
lead to an increasingly rough surface. Prominent grain heads emerge
from the surface, leading to a pseudopyramidal profile. In fact, the
root-mean-square roughness (Rrms) estimated
from the AFM images clearly indicates a temperature activation of
the roughness, with values of 1.2 ± 0.2 and 1.7 ± 0.1 nm
for the ZnO:Ti 5% samples annealed at 400 and 600 °C, respectively.
The complementary analysis of ZnO control samples further illustrated
the temperature activation of the roughness. Remarkably, no significant
differences were identified in the Rrms for films with common annealing temperature but differing in Ti
doping (see Figure S2). With respect to
the relevant microscopic information related to mechanics, the films
show no surface-cracking and good interface adhesion, denoting the
formation of a continuous relaxed film with no drastic tendency toward
delamination.

2.2 Surface Composition and
Wetting
Prior
to a surface inspection, the in-depth analysis of the films was accomplished
by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) measurements in C
resonant conditions. These analyses showed that the in-depth composition
was relatively homogeneous, with some slight surface enrichment in
Ti and with abundant C incorporation (ca. 10% for all the films),
irrespective of the doping level of the films. Figure S3 details the experimental and analyzed spectra of
ZnO:Ti 5% after annealing at 400 and 600 °C (left) and the derived
in-depth analyses (right). In order to obtain a more resolved estimation
of the surface composition on the top of the layers, XPS spectra were
obtained. The surfaces of ZnO:Ti thin films were composed of Zn, O,
Ti, and C (plus a nonaccountable amount of H) with relative composition
depending on the annealing temperature and doping level. Only the
sample with a highest Ti doping level (5%) and annealed at a lower
temperature (400 °C) presented a Cl residue below 1 at. %. In
particular, there were no traces of Si, which confirms the conformal
character of the coating on the substrate and the lack of substrate
out-diffusion.

Relevantly, the chemical state of Zn and Ti was
evaluated by obtaining the corresponding Zn 2p and Ti 2p core-level
spectra. Figure 2a,b
shows the Zn 2p and Ti 2p core-level spectra for the 5% Ti-doped ZnO
surfaces after 600 °C annealing. The characteristic binding energies
(BEs) of the peaks, with 3/2 splitting components at ca. 1021.5 and
458.5 eV, respectively, and their shape clearly illustrate that the
chemical state corresponds to the oxidized Zn (Zn2+ state)
and Ti (Ti4+ state), such as in well-formed ZnO and TiO2.23−25 The O 1s peak (not shown) can be consistently fitted
by two components at 532.0 eV, which is attributed to oxygen in TiO2, and the one at 531.0 eV corresponding to oxygen in the ZnO
structure.27 The described BEs and peak
ratios were common for all the analyzed ZnO:Ti samples at varying
annealing temperature (400 vs 600 °C) and Ti concentration (from
0.1 to 5%).

Figure 2 Characteristic Zn 2p (a) and Ti 2p (b) core-level XPS spectra of
5% Ti-doped ZnO sample annealed at 600 °C. (c) Normalized [Ti]/([Ti]
+ [Zn]) ratio calculated from the survey spectra of the ZnO samples
doped at 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 5% Ti after 400 and 600 °C annealing
compared with the nominal expected value (lines indicate exclusively
trends). (d) Variation of Ti at. % for increasing photoemission angle
for samples doped at 5% at 400 and 600 °C.

Quantitative data obtained from the survey spectra were used
to
monitor the level of surface integration of Ti and Zn with respect
to the nominal values used in the design of the synthesis. The results
of [Ti]/([Ti] + [Zn]) are plotted in Figure 2b for the two annealing temperatures and
a whole range of Ti doping to illustrate a clear enrichment of the
surface in Ti with respect to the expected nominal value. This enrichment
is generalized for all Ti doping levels and annealing temperatures
(only the sample annealed at 400 °C at the lowest doping levels
shows a value equal to the nominal one). The origin of this surface
enrichment can be due to both a preferential condensation of the Ti
precursor during spin-coating because of the fast xerogel formation
kinetics of the titanium precursor and a surface segregation of the
minority element upon thermal annealing.

To further investigate
this point, the surface composition was
evaluated at two additional photoelectron take-off angles for the
samples with the highest Ti doping level and both annealing temperatures.
The results indicate an increase of Ti concentration at the increasing
take-off angle, which is a clear indication of the surface segregation
of Ti. Additionally, this segregation is more pronounced for the sample
annealed at 600 °C, which confirms the critical role played by
the annealing process in this segregation.

To understand the
behavior of the surface of the ZnO films, the
water contact angle (WCA) was evaluated at different doping conditions
and annealing temperatures. All the surfaces exhibited a mild hydrophilic
character with WCA values ranging from 55 to 85°, as illustrated
in Figure 3. The effect
of both Ti doping and annealing temperature can be derived from the
image. An increasing amount of Ti in the ZnO films induced a decrease
of the WCA. However, by comparing the pure ZnO surface at 400 °C,
the effect of low additions of Ti induced an increase of WCA, while
this transition was to a smaller contact angle for the series annealed
at 600 °C. In fact, the contact angle of pure ZnO surfaces exhibited
no significant difference for the 400 and 600 °C annealed samples.

Figure 3 Variation
of WCA for the samples treated at 400 °C (squares)
and 600 °C (circles) and the different Ti doping from 0 (pure
ZnO) to 5% Ti.

For the rest of the samples,
at equivalent Ti doping, the surfaces
exhibited a higher WCA at lower annealing temperatures. The overall
behavior can be understood in terms of an interplay between surface
chemistry and topography. An increasing TiOx fraction induces a more hydrophilic behavior through reinforced
dipolar interactions. On the other hand, the topographic effects induced
by annealing at 600 °C make the surfaces more hydrophilic with
respect to the equivalent at 400 °C. Such reduction of WCA for
a rougher surface reinforces the idea of a strong water–surface
interaction regime in agreement with the Wenzel model.26

2.3 Functional Properties
For a complete
analysis of the effects of the segregation of Ti to the film surface,
the resistivity was measured using the van der Pauw method.27 The results denoted a narrow range of surface
resistivity for the series of samples annealed at 400 and 600 °C
([1–9] × 10–3 and [1–5] ×
10–3 Ω·cm, respectively). However, it
was not possible to establish a trend with respect to the effects
of Ti doping or annealing temperature. Alternatively, Au metallic
contacts were deposited through a micromask on the surfaces of pure
ZnO films and those with 5% Ti doping (at both annealing temperatures)
and the impedance response was analyzed.28 The results are plotted in the Nyquist diagrams of Figure 4a.

Figure 4 (a) Nyquist diagrams
and impedance analysis corresponding to pure
and 5% doped ZnO films after annealing at 400 and 600 °C. (b)
Tauc plots for ZnO, ZnO:Ti 1%, and ZnO:Ti 5% after annealing at 400
°C (left) and 600 °C (right).

Both the effects of doping and annealing show relevant influence
on the final electrical properties. A simple resistor in parallel
to a capacitor model (R1, C1 equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Figure 4a) was observed to fit the
response of all samples. The resistor can be interpreted as the direct
opposition to charge transfer trough the ZnO film, while the capacitor
appears as a contribution of the accumulation of charge, mainly in
grain boundaries and contact to sample interface.

Relevantly,
the presence of Ti doping induces a considerable increase
of the equivalent resistance and a decrease of the capacitor value,
irrespective of the annealing temperature considered. This can be
explained in terms of the microstructural/surface effects observed
upon doping and annealing of ZnO films. In fact, the described tendency
is compatible with the formation of a Ti–O-based grain boundary
on the ZnO nanocrystals, and with the consequent promotion of a surface
conduction deactivating charge accumulation in grain boundaries. These
effects were, however, milder for the samples annealed at 600 °C,
suggesting that grain growth has a dominant effect on favoring film
conduction over the potential negative effects of surface segregation
of a Ti–O-rich surface.

The effects of Ti doping on the
optical properties of the films
are illustrated in Figure 4b for a ZnO reference and ZnO films doped with 1 and 5% Ti.
The results are illustrated in the form of Tauc plots obtained from
UV–vis spectra, which reflected no characteristic absorption
bands (uncolored films). Relevantly, the Tauc plots visibly illustrate
the increasing spectral range induced by Ti doping. Although the optical
band gap for our sol–gel reference ZnO annealed at 400 °C
is 3.25 eV, this band gap is slightly widened to 3.27 eV with 1% Ti
doping and up to 3.36 eV for 5% Ti-doped samples, Figure 4b (left). The main effect of
the annealing at 600 °C is a slight reduction of the optical
band gap, which can be correlated with the microstructural information
that confirms the increase of crystallite size at this temperature.
The increase of the optical band gap upon Ti doping is also related
to the microstructure. In fact, the inhibition of grain growth with
doping allows maintaining a crystallite size within the nanoscale,
which conditions a band gap widening in ZnO materials.29

2.4 Cell Adhesion
The behavior of the
Ti-doped films was assayed at two different levels. We initially explored
the interaction of the surfaces with bacteria. In order to limit the
number of samples, the properties derived from the microstructural
and physical properties was used to screen most relevant samples.
To make the Ti surface segregation effects patent on the surfaces,
adhesion assays with Staphylococcus epidermidis were performed on ZnO films doped with 5% Ti and annealed at 600
°C in comparison with references for pure ZnO and TiO2 samples prepared from the same precursors. We evaluated the total
surface covered by adhered bacteria, the number of adhered bacterial
particles on the different films, as well as the bacterial viability.
The results are plotted in Figure 5.

epidermidis on the surfaces of ZnO doped with 5% Ti
(annealed at 600 °C)
compared with controls for pure ZnO and TiO2. (b) Particle
counting on the same surfaces. (c) Viability (% of dead adhered bacteria)
on the same surfaces. (d) Comparison of the previous parameters on

###: p-value < 0.0001 for Wilcoxon test compared

test compared to ZnO. **: p-value < 0.01 for Wilcoxon
test compared to ZnO. ***: p-value < 0.001 for
Wilcoxon test compared to ZnO.

The percentage of area covered by bacteria was the same for
the
three types of materials (p value = 0.1218 for Kruskal–Wallis
test, Figure 5a). We
found, however, at least 4.4 times more dead adhered bacteria over
ZnO films with respect to Ti-containing films (11.89%, p value < 0.05 for Wilcoxon test) (Figure 5c). It has been previously described that
adherence of S. epidermidis to abiotic
surfaces is a sequential process that involves the initial adhesion
mediated by autolysins and hydrophobic interactions that evolves into
irreversible adherence through the action of specialized adhesins.30,31 Once adhered, other molecules such as aggregation-associated protein
(aap) mediate bacterial accumulation, in order to start the development
of a biofilm.32 In this work, molecules
involved in adherence and accumulation are already expressed on the
surface of the bacteria and explains the similar surface coverage
observed on all the surfaces shown in Figure 5a. However, by the relatively short time
of 90 min, defined by the observation of a high percentage of dead
bacteria on ZnO surfaces, S. epidermidis has not been able to form a stable biofilm. The bactericidal behavior
on ZnO is consistent with previously published literature that shows
the intrinsic toxicity of ZnO due to the release of Zn2+ ions, which destabilize the ionic environment of the bacterial membranes.33,34 We did additional analyses to bacterial viability by reversing the
effect of Zn2+ ions by using the chelating agent clioquinol.
In this case, the viability increased considerably, overpassing that
of the surfaces containing Ti (Figure 5d).

Additionally, although the bacterial coverage
of the samples was
essentially the same, we found that particle counting was significantly
lower when bacteria were grown on ZnO films than on the other materials
(p value < 0.001), showing 31% less counts (Figure 5b). This effect on
pure ZnO is potentially a consequence of the release of Zn2+ ions to the solution from the material. In fact, Zn2+ favors the aap action, present on the surface of S. epidermidis,35 causing
the higher aggregation in small groups of adhered bacteria on ZnO
films, which include both live and dead ones (Figure 5e,f).

We also performed the analysis
of bacterial viability by using
clioquinol, obtaining a high viability (97–99%) (p value = 0.0811) on the pure ZnO samples with respect to the Ti-doped
and TiO2 controls (compare the second column in Figure 5c with the last column
corresponding to clioquinol experiments shown in Figure 5d). Figure 5e,d illustrates the response of S. epidermidis adherence on the pure ZnO surfaces,
denoting aggregation and cell death on pure ZnO films (Figure 5e), which can be chemically
reversed by dosing clioquinol (Figure 5d). These results suggest that the ZnO films release
zinc ions in solution, whereas the addition of 5% of Ti displays similar
features to the TiO2 surface when testing bacterial adhesion
and viability.

In order to evaluate the interaction of human
cells with the ZnO:Ti
films, hMSCs were cultured on surfaces with different doping levels
and annealing temperatures. The analysis was performed in this case
for samples with minimum and maximum Ti doping (0.1 and 5% Ti) and
both annealing temperatures (400 and 600 °C) taking pure ZnO
and TiO2 films as controls. The surface–material
interaction was evaluated from fluorescence microscopy images obtained
after 72 h of culture. Figure 6 shows the typical response of hMSCs to the different surfaces.
It can be observed that cells cultured on ZnO (irrespective of annealing
temperature) exhibit retracted actin cytoskeleton and intermediate
catenin fibers, denoting difficulties for the progression of focal
adhesions. In these conditions, cells aggregate and show a preference
for cell–cell interactions rather than for cell–surface
interactions. A drastic change in the interaction is observed upon
integration of the smaller amount of Ti. In fact, cells spread considerably,
develop polygonal shape, and exhibit elongated filopodia, suggesting
some ease for the formation of focal adhesions with respect to pure
ZnO surfaces. The cells tend to keep physically interconnected but
leave voids in between them in contrast with the previous behavior
on pure ZnO. This tendency is reinforced when the level of Ti doping
is increased to 5% and an annealing is performed at 600 °C. No
drastic change is observed between the two Ti doping levels for annealing
temperatures of 400 °C. Relevantly, the increase of cell spreading
and total surface coverage observed on samples with 5% Ti doping and
600 °C annealing is comparable with the one observed on the TiO2 controls. This result is in agreement with the protective
character of TiO2-coated materials and their ability to
induce cell adhesion.36

Figure 6 hMSCs cultured on the
surface of the ZnO:Ti films annealed at 400
(top) and 600 °C (bottom) and different doping levels (from left
to right: ZnO, ZnO:Ti 0.1%, ZnO:Ti 5%, and TiO2). Green,
actin cytoskeleton/red, α-catenin intermediate fibers/blue,
DAPI nuclear staining.

To establish a more quantitative evaluation of these data,
we performed
a morphometric analysis based on four frames of three different samples
for each type of surface. The cell spreading can be considered as
an indirect measurement of availability of cell binding sites on the
films. However, in local environments with high cell density, cell
spreading may be affected by competitive processes among the cells.
The results of cell expansion area are shown in the histogram of Figure 7. In spite of the
wide error bars, these data significantly illustrate the tendency
of cells to favorably spread on Ti-doped surfaces, irrespective of
the annealing temperature of the films.

Figure 7 Expansion area of hMSCs
cultured on the surface of pure ZnO, ZnO:Ti
0.1 at. %, ZnO:Ti 5 at. %, and TiO2 after annealing at
400 and 600 °C.

The combined information obtained from the culture of bacteria
and hMSCs points to an influence of ZnO solubility on the bioadhesion
through an interaction with Zn2+ ions. However, the presence
of TiO bonds, much more covalent than dominantly ionic bonds in ZnO,
can determine a much more stable ground for biomolecular adsorption,
a starting point in the process of cellular fouling to surfaces. Although
the control of surface charge is a main aspect influencing ionic interactions
with proteins and favoring protein adsorption, the phenomenon is jeopardized
if the environment induces a loss of cohesive forces in the substrate
material. Thus, the surface is no longer able to sustain electrostatic
interactions with foreign bodies, such as proteins, being involved
in a self-disruption.37

In order
to assess the bioadhesiveness of the ZnO:Ti films in a
microdevice application, hMSCs were cultured on the surfaces of one-dimensional
(1D) zigzag micropatterns on silicon substrates. For this experiment,
the surfaces of ZnO doped with 5% Ti and annealing at 600 °C
were chosen. The structure of the zigzag micropattern can be identified
in the SEM image of Figure 8a, showing the Si/ZnO:Ti parallel lines with variable coarsening.
The fluorescence microscopy results (see Figure 8b) show that, in spite of the zigzag effects,
hMSCs perceive the surface of the ZnO:Ti structures as attractive
for adhesion, instead of the previously illustrated and reported poor
adhesion on pure ZnO.

of ZnO:Ti/Si zigzag 1D micropattern (green, actin cytoskeleton/red,

EDS complementary maps of Zn and Si, respectively.

Relevantly, the cells stand preferentially on ZnO:Ti
areas rather
than on Si and exhibit polarization along the main axis of the 1D
ZnO:Ti structures, as illustrated by the energy-dispersive spectroscopy
(EDS) maps of Zn and Si (Figure 8c,d, respectively). We underline that this selective
adhesion must result from the perception of a surface-free energy
contrast by hMSCs. Our contrasts have clear topographic and chemical
contrasts (flat Si vs nanorough ZnO:Ti), which may cooperatively contribute
to the observed adhesion selectivity. These results point to the possibility
of performing new biomedical devices incorporating transition-metal
oxide conductive systems with appropriate surface designs making compatible
a good degree of bioadhesiveness in culture conditions and appropriate
physical properties such as electrical conductivity.

3 Conclusions
Sol–gel spin-coating allows to controllably
synthetize the
Ti-doped ZnO thin films on silicon substrates. The final microstructure
of the films depends on the level of Ti doping and on the annealing
temperature. Increase of grain size and preferential growth along
the z axis of the ZnO wurtzite structure are favored by a high annealing
temperature (600 °C) and low doping levels. Additionally, the
different coordination existing between ZnO and TiO2 leads
to films enriched on Ti at surface level, especially when the Ti point
defect density increases because of high doping levels. The effect
can be partially induced by the heterogeneous condensation during
xerogel formation but is also a result of Ti surface segregation for
samples with high Ti doping levels (5%) and after annealing at high
temperatures (600 °C).

The modification of the surface
composition and topography inherently
affects the wettability of the surfaces. Samples sintered at low temperature
and with low levels of Ti doping are less hydrophilic, although this
hydrophilicity is mild with WCAs over 55 °C on any sample. The
surface electrical properties were affected by Ti doping, with an
increase of surface resistivity to values in the 10–3 Ω·cm range related to Ti doping, 1 order of magnitude
higher than values obtained for reference ZnO-based TCO films.38 Through impedance measurements, we could confirm
that the annealing at 600 °C allows improving the surface electrical
resistance for films doped at 5% with respect to those annealed at
400 °C. Because of the inhibition of grain growth, the ZnO:Ti
films remain transparent in the whole visible spectrum and exhibit
an increase of the band gap with respect to pure ZnO films obtained
with equivalent deposition/annealing process.

The response of S. epidermidis to
culture on ZnO surfaces evidences that the intrinsic release of Zn2+ ions has an effect in the bacterial viability and expansion
on pure ZnO. This effect can be reverted by adding the Zn2+ chelating agent clioquinol, which underlines the role of the ionic
species in the determination of the fate of the bacterial cells. Relevantly,
the ZnO:Ti and TiO2 surfaces are also able to reverse the
ionic damage, which suggests that the Ti doping level of 5% is highly
efficient in providing a stable ground for cell bacterial adherence.

The adhesion of hMSCs on ZnO:Ti samples has been evaluated in comparison
with ZnO and TiO2 controls. The cells adhere and increasingly
expand over the surface of ZnO:Ti samples in agreement with a higher
Ti doping level. The most attractive response in terms of the number
of adhered cells and cell expansion is obtained for ZnO:Ti 5% after
annealing at 600 °C. These conditions were used to create a basic
microdevice consisting of 1D zigzag stripes. The created 1D micropattern
exhibits preferential adhesion of hMSCs with respect to the Si substrate
and is observed to induce cell polarization after 72 h of culture.

These results confirm that the formation of Ti-doped ZnO films
is a reliable route for the fabrication of TCO thin films retaining
a good degree of bioadhesiveness. This allows cell expansion and keeps
relevant physical properties such as conductivity, which are crucial
for the development of new optoelectronic biodevices, such as for
sensing or energy harvesting, which will require programmable lifetimes.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials Processing
A solution of
zinc acetate in ethanol was prepared in concentration 0.2 M. Ethanolamine
was added to the solution as a chelating agent, which allows the control
of the gelation and also avoids the premature linking between metallic
centers. The mixture was under reflux (30–40 °C) and magnetic
stirring.10,39 After 8 h, zinc acetate was completely dissolved
and stabilized in the ethanol solution. Titanium isopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4) was dissolved in ethanol in 0.2
M concentration. HCl (115 μL) was added to the solution to induce
an acid catalysis.40

Several sols
were prepared to obtain different Ti concentrations. The doping level
of Ti ranged from 0.1 to 5% of Zn concentration. For labeling purposes,
the samples identified with “ZnO:Ti n %”
refer to a ZnO thin film with n % Ti doping. Si substrates
with ⟨1 0 0⟩ orientation were used after cleaned with
ethanol and dried in N2 flow. The sol (50 μL) was
cast on the Si surface while spinning at 2500 rpm. After 40 s, the
first xerogel film was formed upon solvent evaporation. Annealing
treatment was applied at temperatures 400 and 600 °C to form
a dense polycrystalline film. The spin-coating–annealing sequence
was applied until six cumulative layers had been deposited.

For the fabrication of the micropatterned ZnO:Ti, ZnO:Ti 5% films
were used after annealing at 600 °C in a process illustrated
in Figure S3. A positive photoresist (Ariston-20
series) was deposited by spin-coating on the ZnO:Ti film (spin time
25 s, spin speed 4000 rpm) and then dried on a hot plate at 70 °C
for 15 min (Figure S3, 1–3). The
photoresist/film stack was then exposed through an acetate slide printed
mask to UV radiation for 3 min (Hamamatsu LC-L1 UV-LED spot light
source, 1 W·cm–2) (Figure S3, 4). The photoresist micropattern was then developed by
immersing the sample in 0.35 M NaOH solution for 2 min (Figure S3, 5). The ZnO:Ti film was then sacrificed
in a HF/HNO3 (2:2) solution for 1 min, adapting recipes
for wet etching of other Ti-containing sol–gel compounds (Figure S3, 6).41 The
photoresist was finally lift-off in acetone and the remaining micropattern
was cleaned in ethanol and distilled water (Figure S3, 7).

4.2 Materials Characterization
The crystallinity
and crystal orientation of the samples were identified by XRD with
Cu Kα (λ = 1.54056 Å) radiation using a Siemens D5000
HR diffractometer. The intensity was determined in the 20° <
θ < 70° range in glazing angle configuration (0.5°).
The morphology and thickness of the Ti:ZnO films were studied by FE-SEM
in a Philips XL-40FEG operated at 10 kV on cross-sectional samples
with no metallization coating. Additional SEM imaging and elementary
maps on micropatterned samples were obtained with a Hitachi S-3000N
equipped with an INCAx-sight EDX system from Oxford Instruments. AFM
was used to monitor the differences in surface roughness of the ZnO
substrates. The AFM used for these experiments was a Nanotec Electrónica
(Madrid, Spain). All images were collected with rectangular Pyrex-Nitride
AFM probes with Cr/Au coating and spring constant of 0.23 N/m and
resonance frequency of 12, 64 kHz (PNP-DB-50, NanoWorld, Innovative
Technologies, Neuchâtel, Switzerland). Images were processed
by the WSxM software 5.0 develop 9.0.42 AFM images were collected with 512 points in contact mode. Roughness
analysis was determined by the Rrms.

The elemental composition and chemical bonding of the ZnO:Ti thin
films was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in a SPECS
PHOIBOS 150 9MCD. A monochromatic Al X-ray source non-Focus-200W-12kV
was employed. The survey and core-level spectra were obtained for
each sample with a pass energy of 75 and 25 eV, respectively. The
spectra were analyzed using CASA XPS software. RBS was used to determine
the in-depth elemental composition of ZnO:Ti films including Zn, O,
Ti, and C. The incident ions were 4He with an energy of 4.26 MeV to
induce C resonant conditions, which drastically increase the detection
sensitiveness to this impurity. For spectra simulation, we used SIMNRA
software43 and experimental cross sections
for non-Rutherford scattering from C.44

Resistivity was measured using a four-point station applying
van
der Pauw’s method.27 Additionally,
the electrical properties of the Ti-doped ZnO films were studied by
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy using a Bio-Logic SP-150 system
after deposition of Au surface contacts. Data acquisition was performed
in a Faraday cage between two surface electrodes up to 1 kHz frequency
applying a 0.5 V amplitude signal. Fitting of data to equivalent circuits
was performed using the EC-Lab software (Bio-Logic Instruments). Static
WCA measurements were carried out in a KSW 100 with droplet volumes
of 3 μL. Results are shown as the mean value of five droplets
deposited on the different ZnO:Ti films.

4.3 In Vitro
Evaluation
A S. epidermidis ATCC 35984 strain adherence study
was performed using a modified protocol described by Kinnari et al.45 Briefly, bacteria were suspended and diluted
in 0.9% NaCl saline solution (SS) (B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany),
reaching 108 colony-forming units (cfu)/mL bacterial solution,
and 5 mL of this solution was incubated onto the samples in a sterile
nontreated six-well plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts,
USA) at 37 °C for 90 min in order to allow adhesion in a static
model. These experimental conditions favor the bacteria/metal oxide
interaction.46 After incubation, the samples
were washed three times with SS to remove the unattached bacteria.
The samples were then stained with the Live/Dead BacLight bacterial
viability kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) and rinsed
with sterile water.47 Ten photographs (40×
magnification) were taken in a DM 2000 fluorescence microscope (Leica
Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) for each sample. The percentage of
the total surface with adhered bacteria and the percentages of dead
and live bacteria were calculated and analyzed by using ImageJ software.
The effect of the Zn2+ cation was chelated by clioquinol
at 1% (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA). Each experiment was performed
in triplicate. Statistical analysis was performed by pairwise comparisons
using the nonparametric Wilcoxon test and by nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis
test for more than two groups, with a level of statistical significance
of p < 0.05 using StataCorp software. Values are
cited and represented as medians.

hMSCs were used as they are
progenitors of osteochondral and adipose tissues, which allow providing
a more generalized bioadhesiveness evaluation than other specialized
lineages. hMSCs from healthy donors were provided by Hospital Universitario
La Princesa (Madrid, Spain). Their use for research was approved by
the ethical committee of the hospital upon informed consent from the
donors. ZnO:Ti surfaces were sterilized in UV, washed with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), and seeded with 15 × 103 cells. hMSCs
were incubated for 72 h (DMEM-LG adjusted to 10% fetal bovine serum)
at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After culture, hMSCs were washed
with PBS and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS. For immune staining,
cells were permeated in 0.5% Triton X-100 (CSK buffer; 100 mM NaCl,
10 mM pipes pH 6.8, 3 mM MgCl2, 3 mM EGTA, and 0.3 M sucrose).
The samples were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Primary
reactions took place with sera from autoimmune mice. After washing,
the surfaces were incubated in dark conditions with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) (1:5000, Calbiochem), actin (green), and α-catenin (red)
secondary antibodies. The surfaces were washed, dehydrated with absolute
ethanol (Merck), and mounted with Mowiol/Dabco (Calbiochem). hMSCs
were visualized in a fluorescence inverted microscope (Olympus IX81)
coupled with a charge-coupled device color camera and analyzed using
ImageJ.
