We
advance the concept that a single efficient antenna ligand substituted in or
added to an otherwise weakly luminescent europium complex is enough
to significantly boost its luminescence. Our results, on the basis
of photophysical measurements on 5 novel europium complexes and 15
known ones, point in the direction that ligand dissimilarity and ligand
diversity are all concepts that clearly play a fundamental role in
the luminescence of europium complexes. We show that it is important
that a symmetry breaker ligand exists in the complex to enhance ligand
dissimilarity and ligand diversity, all mainly affecting the nonradiative
decay rate by reducing it. Because the presence of at least one antenna
ligand is also obviously necessary, the optimal and the most cost-effective
situation can be achieved by adding a single coordination symmetry
breaker that is also an efficient antenna, such as 1-(2-thenoyl)-3,3,3-trifluoroacetone
or 4,4,4-trifluoro-1-phenyl-1,3-butanedione. In such cases the quantum
efficiency, η, is decidedly boosted, as can be verified by going
from complex [EuCl2(TPPO)4]Cl·3H2O with η = 0% to the novel complex [EuCl2(BTFA)(TPPO)3], where TPPO stands for triphenylphosphine oxide, with η
= 62%.

1 Introduction
Luminescence
in europium complexes occurs through the so-called
antenna effect:1 when the complexes are
illuminated with ultraviolet (UV) light, the UV photons are absorbed
by the ligands and the energy is then transferred to the europium
ion, which subsequently decays by emitting visible light in the red-orange
region.

Luminescent europium complexes can be utilized in several
technologies
and biological applications, such as light-emitting diode,2−4 organic light-emitting diode,5,6 bioimaging,7,8 sensing and targeting specific DNA structures,9 melamine detection in milk products,10 and cellular imaging.11

Hence, due to the innumerous applications, intensification of the
brightness of luminescence by chemically modifying the europium complexes
is an active area of research.

The quest to increase brightness
requires designing a complex capable
of (i) being a strong absorbent of incident UV light, (ii) transferring
the absorbed energy to the europium ion, and (iii) decaying mostly
via radiative channels. Of course, the decay via radiative channels
will be preferred if the nonradiative decay rate is minimized. Controlling
all these phenomena synchronously is, of course, a challenging scientific
pursuit.

The quantum yield of luminescence of a europium complex
ϕ,
also called the overall quantum yield, is equal to the number of emitted
photons divided by the number of absorbed photons.12 The quantum efficiency η, also called intrinsic quantum
yield, QEuEu, is the probability of europium emission
once the europium is excited, and is equal to Arad/(Arad + Anrad), where Arad and Anrad are, respectively, the radiative and the nonradiative
decay rates of the excited states of the europium ion, most notably
the 5D0 one.12 The
inverse of the emission lifetime τ is equal to Arad + Anrad.12

Recently, our research group reported a comprehensive
strategy
to boost luminescence in europium complexes by mixing ligands and
exemplified this strategy by mixing nonionic ligands of the type phosphine
oxide and sulfoxide compounds on ternary europium complexes.13 Results showed that increasing the coordination
diversity by the presence of mixed nonionic ligands caused a boost,
both in the emission quantum yield, ϕ, as well as on the emission
quantum efficiency, η.13 Later, it
was also found out that mixing ligands also caused a boost in the
radiative decay rates, Arad.14

Europium β-diketonate complexes
with repeating ligands are
a well-known and highly researched class of luminescent complexes.15−18 However, europium β-diketonate complexes with mixed ligands
are not routine compounds. Actually they are mostly novel complexes
that are only now being researched for their luminescent potential13,12,19 in light of our boost strategy
mentioned above.13

In this article,
we seek to clarify the finer details and aspects
influencing the luminescence of europium complexes. Accordingly, we
studied a set of 20 different europium complexes to unveil and make
explicit the structural aspects most determining of their photophysical
properties, such as ligand diversity, ligand dissimilarity, and centrosymmetry
breaking. The compounds were selected in a combinatorial manner so
that the various structural effects on luminescence could be isolated.
For this purpose, we synthesized five novel chloride complexes: [EuCl2(BTFA)(TPPO)3]; [EuCl(TTA)2(TPPO)2]; [EuCl(BTFA)2(TPPO)2]; [EuCl(DBM)2(TPPO)2]; and [EuCl(DBM)(TTA)(TPPO)2]. We also measured in this
article the luminescence properties
of five other chloride complexes that had syntheses and characterizations
recently reported by our research group: [EuCl2(TPPO)4]Cl·3H2O,20 [EuCl2(TTA)(TPPO)3],21 [EuCl2(DBM)(TPPO)3],21 [EuCl2(TTA)(BTFA)(TPPO)3],21 and [EuCl2(DBM)(BTFA)(TPPO)3].21 Finally, to complete the luminescence databank
for the combinatorial set of compounds, we included the previously
determined luminescence properties of ternary europium(III) complexes
of the types [Eu(β)3(TPPO)2],14,22,23 [Eu(β)2(β′)(TPPO)2],19 and [Eu(β)(β′)(β″)(TPPO)2],19 where β ≠ β′
≠ β″ can be either 1-(2-thenoyl)-3,3,3-trifluoroacetone
(TTA), 4,4,4-trifluoro-1-phenyl-1,3-butanedione (BTFA), or 1,3-diphenylpropane-1,3-dione
(DBM). We then examined the effect of each type of ligand coordinated
to the europium ion on the radiative decay rates using the chemical
partition of Arad.24 We further evaluated the effect of ligand dissimilarity
on the nonradiative decay rates. We conclude by advancing the concept
that a single ligand dissimilarity and ligand diversity enhancer antenna
of high efficiency substituted in or added to an otherwise weakly
luminescent europium complex is enough to significantly boost its
luminescence.

2 Results and Discussion
Table 1 presents
luminescence data for the 5 novel europium complexes and the 15 known
ones, belonging to the seven classes: (i) [EuCl2(TPPO)4]Cl·3H2O; (ii) [EuCl2(β)(TPPO)3]; (iii) [EuCl(β)2(TPPO)2]; (iv) [EuCl(β)(β′)(TPPO)2]; (v) [Eu(β)3(TPPO)2]; (vi) [Eu(β)2(β′)(TPPO)2]; and (vii) [Eu(β)(β′)(β″)(TPPO)2], where β ≠ β′ ≠ β″
in all types stands for ionic β-diketonate ligands, which function
as antennae and can be either TTA, BTFA, or DBM.

b A sequence of dashes,
-----, indicates
that data could not be measured due to very poor luminescence.

As such, we vary the ionic ligands
in a combinatorial manner and
maintain the same nonionic ligands throughout. We chose TPPO as the
nonionic ligand because it is bulky, relatively rigid and therefore,
in principle, should not contribute significantly to the nonradiative
processes. The novel chloride europium complexes, [EuCl2(BTFA)(TPPO)3], [EuCl(TTA)2(TPPO)2], [EuCl(BTFA)2(TPPO)2], [EuCl(DBM)2(TPPO)2], and [EuCl(DBM)(TTA)(TPPO)2], were
all synthesized and had their photophysical properties measured, as
mentioned in this article. The other chloride complexes, [EuCl2(TPPO)4]Cl·3H2O, [EuCl2(TTA)(TPPO)3], [EuCl2(DBM)(TPPO)3], [EuCl2(TTA)(BTFA)(TPPO)3], and [EuCl2(DBM)(BTFA)(TPPO)3], had
been previously synthesized20,21 and had their photophysical
properties measured in this work (as can be seen in the Supporting Information). The luminescence data
for complexes of classes (v)–(vii) were obtained from previous
works by our research group.13,14,19

Complex [EuCl2(TPPO)4]Cl·3H2O presents a luminescence which is so low that its quantum
efficiency
η can be taken as being essentially 0%. This can be explained
by the absence of efficient antennae in the complex structure, which
contains only chlorides and TPPOs as ligands.

Of the β-diketonate
ligands, only TTA and BTFA display high
efficiencies as antennae. Indeed, the efficiency of DBM, as an antenna,
is very poor, as we verified in the case of the complex [EuCl2(DBM)(TPPO)3], which we prepared by adding a DBM
ligand to [EuCl2(TPPO)4]Cl·3H2O and by eliminating its chloride counter ion. This complex displays
such a low luminescence that is essentially immeasurable.

Clearly,
for luminescence to emerge, it is important that at least
one good antenna ligand be present in the structure. However, our
results indicate that adding more than one antenna does not necessarily
improve the quantum efficiency further, as can be seen in Table 1, when complexes with
only one antenna ligand display the largest quantum efficiencies η.

Indeed, the fact that adding more of the same antenna ligand to
a complex does not necessarily improve the quantum efficiency indicates
that there are more factors at play, factors that deserve a closer
and more detailed examination.

2.1 Coordination Centrosymmetry
Breaking Ligands
The Laporte rule25 states that atomic
f–f transitions are forbidden in centrosymmetric chemical environments.
Therefore, to make radiative decay less forbidden and thus more likely
to occur, relaxation of centrosymmetry must take place. This, in itself,
is well-known.26 Only recently, it was
advanced and experimentally proven that a significant manner in which
this can be obtained is to move from same ligand complexes to mixed-ligand
ones.13 Indeed, by strategically mixing
ligands, one can break centrosymmetry in a much more decisive manner
than, for example, by thermal vibrations.

The reduction in quantum
efficiency displayed in Table 1, when more antennae are added to the complex, can be understood
in terms of which ligands make centrosymmetry happen and which ligands
break the centrosymmetry.

Triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO), with
its three phenyl groups attached
to a phosphine oxide, is a very bulky ligand, so when there are only
two of them attached to the europium ion, they prefer to place themselves
opposite to each other, thereby enhancing the centrosymmetry of the
complex, as in Figure 1. This preference for opposite placements with respect to the europium
ion, predicted by Sparkle/RM1,27 had already
been established by crystallography for two of the complexes [Eu(TTA)3(TPPO)2]22 and [Eu(BTFA)3(TPPO)2].23

Figure 1 Fully optimized
Sparkle/RM1 geometry and the chemical structure
of the complex [Eu(BTFA)3(TPPO)2].

Moreover, in complexes of the type [Eu(β)3(TPPO)2], the three β-diketonates tend to
place themselves
in a triangular positioning around the europium ion in the equatorial
plane, as can also be seen in Figure 1.

On the other hand, when there are three TPPOs,
Sparkle/RM1 predicts
quite logically that two of these remain relatively opposite to each
other, but the third is necessarily placed in another position without
a counterpart. This removes some symmetry, which occurs when several
identical β-diketonates are all coordinated to a single center.
Therefore, centrosymmetry is necessarily reduced because TPPO is very
different from the other ionic ligands, as can be seen in Figure 2. This explains why
complexes with three TPPOs have larger quantum efficiencies when compared
with complexes with two TPPOs, as shown in Table 1. Clearly, complexes with three TPPOs cannot
be centrosymmetric and, provided the requirement that at least one
antenna should be present in the complex is satisfied, luminescence
ensues.

of the complex [EuCl2(BTFA)(TPPO)3].

2.2 Chloride as a Ligand Dissimilarity
Enhancer
In complexes of the kind [EuCl(β)2(TPPO)2], chloride now replaces one of the β-diketonates
in the equatorial
plane, as in Figure 3. Given the fact that it consists of a single atom, the chloride
dramatically increases ligand dissimilarity and makes the situation
in the equatorial plane significantly less centrosymmetric, as can
be seen in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Fully optimized Sparkle/RM1 geometry and the chemical structure
of the complex [EuCl(BTFA)2(TPPO)2].

Chloride, by being a single atom, turns out to
be a very efficient
ligand dissimilarity enhancer and coordination symmetry breaker, which
can boost luminescence in a significant manner. Indeed, from Table 1, the average quantum
efficiency of the complexes [Eu(β)3(TPPO)2], of η = 31%13 (with β ligand
being either TTA or BTFA) is boosted by 48% in complexes with a single
chloride ligand [EuCl(β)2(TPPO)2] to η
= 46%.

As mentioned above, DBM, being a β-diketonate,
is an antenna,
albeit with a very low efficiency. We then decided to examine whether
the replacement of a DBM by a chloride would also significantly boost
the quantum efficiency of the luminescence of [Eu(DBM)3(TPPO)2],14 which is immeasurably
low. Indeed, that was the case, as can be verified by examining Table 1. The quantum efficiency
jumped from essentially 0% for [Eu(DBM)3(TPPO)2]14 to 17% for [EuCl(DBM)2(TPPO)2].

2.3 β-Diketonate
as a Coordination Symmetry
Breaker
If a simple single-atom ligand, as chloride, is capable
of breaking the coordination symmetry of europium complexes and boosting
luminescence, then a different β-diketonate should play a similar
role as a ligand dissimilarity enhancer and coordination symmetry
breaker.

As such, let us consider the difference in luminescence
in going from complexes [Eu(β)3(TPPO)2] to complexes [Eu(β)2(β′)(TPPO)2], where β′ behaves as a ligand
dissimilarity enhancer and coordination symmetry breaker. Results
are summarized in Table 1 for β = TTA and BTFA.

Again, the average quantum efficiency
of complexes of the type
[Eu(β)3(TPPO)2] is η = 31%, whereas
by adding a different β-diketonate as a ligand dissimilarity
enhancer and coordination symmetry breaker, [Eu(β)2(β′)(TPPO)2], the quantum efficiency is boosted
by 52% to an average of η = 47%, quite similar to the boost
of 48% obtained by employing chloride as a coordination symmetry breaker.
The chemical nature of the coordination symmetry breaking ligand per
se is thus seemingly not relevant. It is important, though, that a
symmetry breaker ligand exists so that ligand dissimilarity and ligand
diversity are enhanced.

2.4 Antennae as Ligand Dissimilarity
Enhancers
Because we established the need for at least one
efficient antenna
ligand and also one ligand dissimilarity enhancer and coordination
symmetry breaker ligand, let us now examine the cases when the antenna
and the ligand dissimilarity and coordination symmetry breaker roles
are played out, simultaneously, by a single ligand. That could turn
out to be perhaps an optimal condition.

Now, let us first consider
complex [Eu(DBM)3(TPPO)2], which does not contain
any highly efficient antennae. By replacing a DBM with either a BTFA
or a TTA, which behave as good antennae, as ligand dissimilarity enhancers
and as coordination symmetry breakers, the boost in luminescence is
dramatic, from essentially zero to an average of η = 44%.

Likewise, consider now the complex [EuCl2(TPPO)4]Cl·3H2O, which also does not have any antennae
in its formula and therefore displays a quantum efficiency of essentially
zero. The addition of a DBM as a symmetry breaker, leading to [EuCl2(DBM)(TPPO)3], does not help because DBM is not
an efficient antenna. Indeed, the quantum efficiency remains immeasurably
low. However, by adding a symmetry breaker, which is also a very effective
antenna, such as TTA or BTFA, the quantum efficiency is boosted tremendously,
to a maximum of η = 62% for [EuCl2(BTFA)(TPPO)3]. The fact that this recordist complex has two chloride ions
as ligands adds to the reality that the chemical nature of the other
ligands that are neither antennae nor ligand dissimilarity enhancers
or coordination symmetry breakers plays only a supportive role in
the luminescence phenomenon, not a protagonist one.

2.5 Several Ligand Dissimilarity Enhancers
If a single
coordination symmetry breaker is capable of significantly
boosting the quantum efficiency of luminescence of europium complexes,
one could guess that perhaps several coordination symmetry breakers
would lead to an even more luminescent complex. However, we verified
that the presence of several symmetry breakers not only quickly exhausts
their effect on the luminescence, but also starts to slowly interfere
negatively, one with the other. From Table 1, the quantum efficiencies of the fully mixed
ionic ligand complexes of the formulae [EuCl(β)(β′)(TPPO)2] have an average η = 34%, a value which is equivalent
to the average η = 36% of complexes [EuCl(β)2(TPPO)2]. Likewise, the quantum efficiency of the fully
mixed ionic ligand complex [Eu(DBM)(BTFA)(TTA)(TPPO)2]
is η = 45%,19 a value which is equivalent
to the average η = 47%19 of all six
complexes of the type [Eu(β)2(β′)(TPPO)2]. Thus, the chemical difficulty involved in the synthesis
of a fully mixed-ligand complex does not translate into further luminescence
boost and is therefore not justified.

2.6 Chemical
Partition of Arad′
The
radiative decay rate Arad of a given complex
is a more direct measure of how less forbidden the f–f transitions
become in the presence of the ligands. Recently, our research group
introduced the chemical partition of Arad′,24 where Arad′ is the sum of the contributions of the 5D0 →7FJ (J = 2, 4, and 6) transitions, which represent more than 90% of Arad. Such a partition provides a very useful
assessment, in chemical terms, of the role of each ligand as a facilitator
of the radiative decay in the complex. The larger the value of Arad and Arad′, the more is the complex luminescence
via radiative channels.

Accordingly, to calculate the chemical
partition, we first fully optimized the geometries of the complexes
with the Sparkle/RM1 model.27 The quality
of the obtained geometries was then assessed from the values of the Q, D, and C parameters,28 as arrived at by the LUMPAC software29 from the emission spectra of the europium complexes.
LUMPAC adjusts these Q, D, and C parameters for each europium complex to reproduce the
various experimentally obtained intensity parameters Ωλ,exp,30,31 with λ = 2 and 4. Table S1 of the Supporting Information shows all Q, D, and C parameters from LUMPAC,
as well as the values of Ωλ,exp, with λ
= 2 and 4 and the values of Ωλ,theo with λ
= 2, 4, and 6.

The fitted parameters Q, D, and C must obey the acceptance criterion D/C > 1 for a unique adjustment.28 If the ratio D/C ≤ 1, the
optimized geometry of the europium complex is deemed not to be consistent
with the experimental intensity parameters Ωλ,exp. From Table S1, all D/C values for all studied complexes are greater
than 1. So, all Ωλ,theo values are compatible
with the corresponding experimental values Ωλ,exp. For example, the D/C ratio calculated
for the [EuCl2(TTA)(TPPO)3] complex was 1.51.

The Ωλ,exp with λ = 2 and 4 obtained
from the emission spectrum of the complex were 32.64 × 10–20 and 6.75 × 10–20 cm2, respectively, and compare with the corresponding fitted values
obtained from LUMPAC,29 that were 32.62
× 10–20 and 6.76 × 10–20 cm2, respectively. Therefore, the theoretical model can
be considered adjusted to the experimental data. It was further possible
to calculate the Ω6 value, which could not be measured
from the experimental emission spectrum.

Finally, using LUMPAC
software, we performed the actual calculations
of the chemical partition of radiative decay rates, Arad′.24 For example, Figure 4 shows the effects of each of the ligands
on Arad′ according to the chemical partition for the complexes [EuCl2(BTFA)(TPPO)2], [EuCl(BTFA)2(TPPO)3], and [EuCl(TTA)(BTFA)(TPPO)2].

for complexes [EuCl2(BTFA)(TPPO)3], [EuCl(BTFA)2(TPPO)2], and [EuCl(TTA)(BTFA)(TPPO)2].

Now, we are in position to evaluate
the effects of types of ligands,
such as chlorides, β-diketonates, and nonionic ones (TPPO),
on the radiative decay rates of luminescence of the novel europium
complexes studied in this article. Table 2 shows the average effects per ligand according
to the chemical partition, categorized by types of ligands on the
radiative decay rates corresponding to 5D0 → 7FJ, where J =
2, 4, and 6 electronic transitions.

a Ionic (either chloride or β-diketonate) Arad′ionic, or nonionic Arad′nonionic coordinated to europium(III)
for each of the eight chloride containing europium(III) complexes.

From Table 2 it
is possible to immediately verify that the chloride ligand effects
on the radiative decay rates are very small, around 60 s–1, reinforcing their role as essentially symmetry breaking species,
not as forthright facilitators of radiative decay.

As mentioned
in the previous sections, the presence of three TPPOs,
two of them opposite to each other, and the third adjacent to one
of them, breaks the centrosymmetry of the complex in a significant
manner. That is why the average effect of the TPPOs in the complexes
of type [EuCl2(β)(TPPO)3] is 235 s–1, which is much larger than that in complexes of the
types [EuCl(β)2(TPPO)2] and [EuCl(β)(β′)(TPPO)2], where this value is 55 s–1.

In
complexes of the type [EuCl2(β)(TPPO)3], Arad′ is dominated by the contributions of the three TPPOs, each
supplying 235 s–1, for an average total of 705 s–1. On the other hand, for complexes of the types [EuCl(β)2(TPPO)2] and [EuCl(β)(β′)(TPPO)2], Arad′ is now governed by the β-diketonate ligands, whose total
contributions average 707 s–1. Once again, this
inversion of preponderance can be understood in geometric terms. Because
the bulky TPPOs are opposite to each other, the β-diketonate
ligands then end up being adjacent to each other due to the presence
of the chloride ligand. Hence, the β-diketonate ligands are
forced into a non-centrosymmetric arrangement, thus dominating the
effect of making the radiative transition less forbidden. The chemical
partition thus clarifies the otherwise unexpected role of the ligand
dissimilarity enhancer chloride.

2.7 Effect
of Ligand Dissimilarity on Anrad
Nonradiative decay processes tend
to depopulate the excited levels of the Eu(III) complexes, most notably
the 5D0 state, thus reducing luminescence. Lessening
the nonradiative decay rate is therefore highly desirable and a very
important research goal.

Unfortunately, despite the insights
provided by earlier research,32−34 many factors involved in determining
the nonradiative decay rate still elude us.

As a matter of fact, Anrad values display
much wider variations among complexes than Arad values. In Table 1, the standard deviation of all Arad values present is 209 s–1, whereas the same quantity
for Anrad is 1266 s–1, which is 6 times larger. In addition, although the difference between
the largest Arad value in Table 1 from its lowest is 948 s–1, the same for Anrad is
a whopping 5699 s–1, again 6 times larger.

Therefore, detecting what affects Anrad, is truly more important for luminescence than controlling what
affects Arad.

Our present results
point in the direction that ligand dissimilarity
is seemingly even more important for nonradiative decays than for
radiative ones.

Take, for example, the data in Table 3, which evidence what happens
to Arad and Anrad when
going from complexes with three identical ionic ligands to complexes
with two identical and a third different ionic ligand. For BTFA complexes
with one coordination symmetry breaker, the average value of Arad is 1084 s–1, whereas the
corresponding value for the complex without a coordination symmetry
breaker, [Eu(BTFA)3(TPPO)2], Arad is 919 s–1, which
is a difference of only +165 s–1. That the coordination
symmetry breaker species does seem to affect more intensively the
nonradiative decay rates, Anrad, can be
verified by the fact that the average value of Anrad is 1027 s–1 for these BTFA complexes
with one coordination symmetry breaker, whereas the corresponding
value of Anrad without a coordination
symmetry breaker, [Eu(BTFA)3(TPPO)2], is 1806
s–1, for a difference of −779 s–1. Note that the absolute value of −779 s–1 is almost 5 times that of +165 s–1.

TTA	[Eu(TTA)(DBM)2(TPPO)2]19	1082	1328	
 	average	1027	1266	
Similar figures for TTA complexes are 1027 and 796
s–1 for Arad, for a
difference of +231 s–1. Likewise, for Anrad,
the figures are 1266 and 2061 s–1, for a difference
of −795 s–1. Again, please note that the
absolute value of −795 s–1 is more than 3
times that of +231 s–1.

Clearly, ligand dissimilarity
has a double desirable effect by
both increasing Arad and at the same time,
by reducing Anrad.

However, the
effect of ligand dissimilarity on reducing Anrad is much stronger.

Following this reasoning, we could
presume that a fully mixed ionic
ligand complex would then display even lower values of Anrad. From the data in Table 4, for both the BTFA and TTA cases, Anrad is indeed lowered by going from the nonmixed
ionic ligand complexes to the fully mixed ones. However, the lowest Anrad values occur for intermediary complexes
of the type [Eu(L)2(L′)(TPPO)2], as is
clear from Table 3,
and not for the fully mixed ones of the type [Eu(L)(L′)(L″)(TPPO)2] in Table 4. Too much diversity does not seem to be advantageous for Anrad.

Now, we are faced with a choice, we can either increase
ligand
dissimilarity by going from the three β-diketonates to either
(i) one β-diketonate and two chlorides, to (ii) two β-diketonates
and one chloride, or (iii) two identical β-diketonates and a
third different one. Our present results indicate that it is much
better to choose (i), that is, the situation of one single antenna
with high efficiency, which we suspect might probably have more to
do with the radiative processes, and two chlorides, which we suspect
have more to do with the nonradiative processes, and the reason might
possibly be because a chloride is much more dissimilar to a β-diketonate
than another β-diketonate.

3 Conclusions
Our intention in this article was not to arrive at complexes with
excellent efficiencies but rather to unveil factors and aspects affecting
luminescence to further strengthen knowledge of this phenomenon on
a more fundamental level.

Results point in the direction that
ligand dissimilarity, ligand
diversity, and centrosymmetry are all concepts that seemingly play
a fundamental role in the luminescence of europium complexes. Indeed,
in a previous article, we had already shown that luminescence could
be boosted13 by moving from a homoleptic
to a heteroleptic coordination.

Our results further revealed
that the effects of chloride ligands
on the radiative decay rates are indeed very small, around 60 s–1 (according to the chemical partition of Arad′), reinforcing
their role as essentially ligand dissimilarity enhancers and not as
forthright facilitators of radiative decay.

Truly, more than
centrosymmetry breaking, it is ligand diversity
and ligand dissimilarity that enhance luminescence, mainly by reducing
the nonradiative decay rate, and the classical parity rule and its
relaxation have very little to do with nonradiative decays, but the
fact is that nonradiative decay rates are much more affected by ligand
dissimilarity than by radiative decay rates, by an order of magnitude.

On the other hand, chloride, by being a single atom, turned out
to be a very efficient coordination symmetry breaker and ligand dissimilarity
enhancer, capable of boosting luminescence in a significant manner
due to its unexpected strong effect on the nonradiative decay rate Anrad.

Indeed, we found out that the chemical
nature of the coordination
symmetry breaking ligand per se is seemingly not relevant. It is important,
however, that a symmetry breaker ligand exists and that ligand dissimilarity,
or ligand diversity, is enhanced, all affecting mainly Anrad by reducing it.

The presence of at least one
antenna ligand is nevertheless obviously
necessary. Therefore, the optimal and the most cost-effective situation
can be achieved by adding a single symmetry breaker that is also an
efficient antenna, such as TTA or BTFA. In such cases, the quantum
efficiency is boosted tremendously to a maximum of η = 62% for
the novel complex [EuCl2(BTFA)(TPPO)3]. The
cost effectiveness of this unprecedented strategy is due to the fact
that chloride ions are much less expensive than any efficient antenna
ligand.

These are easy to use chemical ideas, independent of
the chemical
nature of the ligands, that we devised and proved experimentally.

In summary, our results indicate that a single ligand dissimilarity
enhancer antenna of high efficiency substituted in, or added to, an
otherwise weakly luminescent europium complex is enough to significantly
boost its luminescence.

4.2 Syntheses
of the Novel Chloride Europium Complexes
Previously, our
research group reported a strategy for the synthesis
of mixed-ligand europium complexes with chloride and β-diketonate
ligands, exemplified by the synthesis of [EuCl2(TTA)(TPPO)3] from [EuCl2(TPPO)4]Cl·3H2O.21 This same strategy was followed
for the syntheses of all five novel complexes [EuCl2(BTFA)(TPPO)3], [EuCl(TTA)2(TPPO)2], [EuCl(BTFA)2(TPPO)2], [EuCl(DBM)2(TPPO)2], and [EuCl(DBM)(TTA)(TPPO)2], all starting from 1 mmol
of [EuCl2(TPPO)4]Cl·3H2O as
well. In all cases, after the first addition of 1 equiv of a ligand,
we let the mixture sit under reflux for 16 h and after the addition
of another equivalent of either the same ligand or of another ligand,
we let the mixture sit under stirring and reflux for 24 more hours.
The differences were as follows: (i) for the synthesis of [EuCl2(BTFA)(TPPO)3], 1 equiv of BTFA was used; (ii)
for [EuCl(TTA)2(TPPO)2], [EuCl(BTFA)2(TPPO)2], and [EuCl(DBM)2(TPPO)2], 2 equiv of the ligands, either TTA, BTFA, or DBM, were used; and
(iii) for [EuCl(DBM)(TTA)(TPPO)2], we first used 1 equiv
of DBM and then 1 equiv of TTA.

All samples for infrared spectroscopy experiments

in the Supporting Information.

During
our theoretical modeling of the structures, we could construct
several possible coordination isomers for the synthesized complexes.
By analyzing the lifetime curves for the complexes, we could not detect
any summation of two or more different exponential decays. Therefore,
from the perspective of luminescence, all solutions behave as if there
is only one compound present in each one. Indeed, if there are two,
or even more coordination isomers present, they all have identical
luminescent properties within the resolution of our equipment. Hence,
possible mixes of very similar isomers, evidenced mainly in some of
the 19F and 31P NMR spectra present in the Supporting Information, do not invalidate our
results and conclusions that focus on photophysical properties and
luminescence. So far, no techniques have been developed by our group
to isolate several very similar coordination isomers of a given europium
complex from each order. Future research must address this issue.

4.4 Luminescence
The
photophysical properties
emission quantum efficiency, η, radiative decay rates, Arad, and nonradiative decay rates, Anrad were determined from excitation spectra, emission
spectra, and lifetime curves. These measurements were carried out
by using 10–4 M chloroform solutions of the europium
complexes with chloride ligands considered in this work. The maxima
in the excitation spectra for all samples were found in the region
from 362 to 400 nm for emissions at a wavelength of 612 nm, corresponding
to the hypersensitive transition from 5D0 to 7F2 for the trivalent europium ion.

The slit
used in the experiments was 1.0 nm for both emission and excitation
spectroscopic measurements. All photophysical experiments were performed
at room temperature, close to 25 °C, using a Fluorolog-3 Horiba
Jobin Yvon with a Hamamatsu R928P photomultiplier, a SPEX 1934 D phosphorimeter,
and a 150 W pulsed xenon lamp.

All excitation spectra, emission
spectra, and lifetime curves are
presented in the Supporting Information.

4.5 Computational Details
The computational
strategy was the one described in our previous article,19 in which we employed the semiempirical Sparkle/RM127 model, and the quantum chemical software MOPAC
2016.35 Accordingly, the first step of
the computational strategy was to calculate the fully optimized geometries
of the chloride ligand europium complexes considered in this article.
We further calculated all vibration modes for these complexes to make
sure there were no imaginary frequencies and that the optimized structures
were true minima. Finally, by using LUMPAC software,28 we determined the luminescence intensity parameters Ω2, Ω4, and Ω6, as well as
the emission quantum efficiency, η, the radiative decay rate, Arad, and the nonradiative decay rate, Anrad, all assuming the refractive index of the
medium to be 1.45, because the measurements of excitation spectra,
emission spectra, and lifetime curves were performed for the chloride
europium complexes in chloroform solutions.
