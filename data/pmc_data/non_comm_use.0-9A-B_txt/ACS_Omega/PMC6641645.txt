A number of graphene
allotropes constructed by sp3,
sp2, and sp hybrid orbitals have recently been proposed
to provide the broad potential for practical applications. Here, using
molecular dynamics simulation, the structural and tensile characteristics
of nine distinct graphene allotropes have been investigated to understand
their morphology-controlled mechanical properties. Results show that
the averaged out-of-plane displacement is independent of nonhexagons
while being dominated by the arrangement of carbon polygons on the
sheets. Each sheet possesses unique surface morphology and in-plane
tensile properties that significantly vary with morphology and anisotropic
crystalline orientation. Brittle, semibrittle, or ductile failure
is observed, depending on the evolution of their packed polygons in
facilitating tension deformation and in dissipating energy. Particularly,
pentagraphene exhibits superductility as a consequence of large-scale
structural transformations, accommodating stress relaxation beyond
initial failure. Two distinct plastic deformation patterns in overstretched
pentagraphene are uncovered, depending on the tension directions:
one is dominated by structural transition from sp3-carbon-contained
penta-(C5) to mixed sp2-carbon polygons and
the other is mainly controlled by a stepwise pentagon-to-hexagon transition.
These findings provide physical insights into the structural evolvement
of two-dimensional graphene allotropes and their effects on the mechanical
properties.

Introduction
Carbon is one of the
unique elements in nature, and it has four
electrons in its outermost valence shell for forming spn (n = 1, 2, 3)-hybridized bonds,
yielding a large number of carbon allotropes from zero to three dimensions,
such as carbon buckyballs,1 carbyne,2 carbon nanotubes (CNTs),3 graphene,4 and carbon nanocoils.5 So far, physical and chemical properties of various
carbon allotropes have been experimentally or theoretically identified.
For instance, depending on the symmetry of the molecular structure,
one-dimensional (1D) carbyne exhibits either metallic or insulating
electrical behaviors, and the Peierls transition of carbyne from symmetric
sp2 cumulene to asymmetric sp1 polyyne structure
leads to two distinct electronic properties.6 The graphene prepared from three-dimensional graphite by using micromechanical
cleavage technology,4 a truly two-dimensional
(2D) structure of a carbon allotrope, has been demonstrated to have
a number of unique properties, such as the anomalous half-integer
quantum Hall effect, the never-falling conductivity, and massless
carriers.7,8 It is believed that carbon sp2 atoms arranged in a honeycomb structure of hexagonal polygons are
responsible for those extraordinary properties in graphene.

Intrigued by the fantastic properties of 2D graphene mentioned
above, the 2D graphene allotropes composed of different topological
arrangements of sp2-carbon atoms have triggered much interest
in their unique structures and mechanical properties. Inspired by
necessary presence of odd-membered rings (pentagons and heptagons)
in helicoidal CNTs9,10 and spherical fullerenes,11 Terrones et al.12 designed three graphene allotropes with different symmetries, named
rectangular haeckelite (R-haeckelite), hexagonal haeckelite (H-haeckelite),
and oblique haeckelite (O-haeckelite), consisting of ordered arrangements
of pentagons, hexagons, and heptagons with sp2-carbon atoms.
All haeckelite structures exhibit an intrinsic metallic behavior independent
of orientation. Wang et al.13 predicted
another graphene allotrope with a unit cell of 20 sp2-carbon
atoms, termed phagraphene, which is also composed of pentagons, hexagons,
and heptagons. It was found that phagraphene possesses distorted Dirac
cones and the direction-dependent cones are robust against an external
strain with tunable Fermi velocities. On the other hand, several 2D
carbon sheets made of pentagons, hexagons, and octagons, such as pentahexoctite
and HOP graphene, were found.14,15 Similarly, the pentahexoctite
and HOP graphene both present metallic behaviors. In addition to those
graphene allotropes containing odd-membered rings, other two carbon
allotropes called T-graphene and S-graphene containing only tetrarings
and octarings were proposed.16,17 T-graphene can be planar
or buckled, depending on the number of square sublattices in a unit
cell and planarity of two adjacent square sublattices. In contrast
to planar T-graphene, buckled T-graphene has Dirac-like fermions with
a high Fermi velocity. Recently, a novel 2D structure of graphene
allotrope exfoliated from T12-carbon was proposed and named pentagraphene
by Zhang et al.18 Unlike the above graphene
allotropes, pentagraphene consisting of only pentagons is a mixed
sp2–sp3-hybridized system of carbon with
one-third of sp3-carbon atoms and two-third of sp2-carbon atoms. It is corrugated in out-of-plane direction in a periodic
manner because of the tetrahedral character of the sp3-hybridized
bonds.

Because of their ultrathin 2D nature, these graphene
allotropes
possess unique mechanical properties and hence possess unique electrical
properties.16,18 Therefore, fundamental studies
on the relationships between their structures and mechanical properties
are necessary to guide their applications. Although some efforts have
been made to understand their mechanical properties,18−26 they are still limited, particularly in anisotropic deformation
responses, strain-induced structural transition, and fracture mechanisms.
Therefore, this study aims to explore the mechanical characteristics
of nine distinct graphene allotropes containing nonhexagonal carbon
rings under uniaxial tension by large-scale molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations, thus providing physical insights into the tensile properties
of graphene allotropes with different topological arrangements of
carbon polygons.

Results and Discussion
Surface Morphology
Nine distinct graphene allotropes
including pentagraphene, T-graphene, S-graphene, pentahexoctite, HOP
graphene, phagraphene, R-haeckelite, H-haeckelite, and O-haeckelite,
with topological carbon polygons from tetragon to octagon, are taken
into investigation. Top views of atomistic lattices of these carbon
nanostructures along with unit cells are presented in Figure 1. More detailed structural
information about the nanostructures is listed in Table 1. All studied monolayer sheets
are generated to be approximately 300 × 300 Å2 in dimensions during the MD simulations. The number of carbon atoms
varies from 30 720 to 46 464, depending on the type
of graphene allotropes.

Figure 1 Geometric structures of nine distinct graphene
allotropes containing
various nonhexagonal carbon rings. Gray balls represent the carbon
atoms. Quadrilaterals marked by black solid lines denote a unit cell
structure. Color coding for topological polygons, ranging from trigons
to decagons, is indicated.

To evaluate the comparative
stability of these graphene allotropes, the total potential energies
are calculated from the relaxed structures at 10 K. The MD simulation
differs from the predictions at the ground energy state by first-principles
calculation, in which a small number of atoms are employed and out-of-plane
atomic displacements usually do not occur after relaxation. The differences
in the energies per atom (Δe) between the examined
allotropes and pristine graphene are calculated as follows 1  where Etot(sheet) is the total potential energy of relaxed graphene allotrope sheets
of N atoms and e0 is
the energy per atom in a perfect graphene sheet. It can be seen from Figure 2a that potential
energies of all examined graphene allotropes relative to those of
pristine graphene are positive, implying that they are metastable.
It suggests that the formation of graphene allotropes composed of
tetrarings will be most energy-unfavorable. The most stable structures
are allotropes constructed by periodically distributed Cn carbon rings, where n = 5, 6, 7,
and 8. Particularly, the pentagraphene made of purely pentagonal rings
is excluded because of its violation of isolated pentagon rules and
mixed sp2–sp3-hybridized bonds. It is
noted that some carbon allotropes with high energies, such as C20 fullerene,27 carbyne,6,28 and graphene containing high concentrations of C4–C8 rings,29 have been successfully
synthesized in laboratory settings, which implies that they could
be thermodynamically metastable.

between nine graphene
allotropes and graphene from our MD calculations and available data
of first-principles calculations in the literature. (b) Averaged out-of-plane
displacement amplitude of nine graphene allotropes. (c) Diverging
out-of-plane displacement field of nine graphene allotropes. The red
and blue colors of atom represent positive and negative atomic displacements
along the out-of-plane z direction, respectively.

At nonzero temperature, thermal-induced
out-of-plane fluctuations
with ripples spontaneously appear in a 2D lattice and distort the
lattice. The characteristic length of the ripples falls in the range
of the averaged out-of-plane displacement, which is defined as 2  where hcom is
the position in the normal (z) direction of the examined
whole graphene allotrope sheet and mi and hi are the mass and the position in the normal (z)
direction of the i atom, respectively. The calculated
value of averaged out-of-plane displacement for relaxed graphene allotropes
at 10 K is presented in Figure 2b. Distinct averaged out-of-plane displacements varying from
around 0.048 to 6.549 Å are observed, suggesting a strong structure-dependent
thermal-induced out-of-plane displacement. These averaged out-of-plane
displacements are substantially larger than the magnitude of intrinsic
ripples in the pristine graphene sheet under the same conditions.
It can be found that the relationship of averaged out-of-plane displacements
for graphene allotropes is on the order of ⟨h⟩T-graphene < ⟨h⟩pentagraphene < ⟨h⟩HOP graphene < ⟨h⟩pentahexoctite < ⟨h⟩H-haeckelite < ⟨h⟩S-graphene < ⟨h⟩R-haeckelite < ⟨h⟩R-haeckelite < ⟨h⟩phagraphene < ⟨h⟩O-haeckelite. T-graphene, pentagraphene, and HOP graphene yield ⟨h⟩ of 1.0 Å, comparable to the interatomic C–C
distance. For T-graphene, the averaged out-of-plane displacement of
0.048 Å confirms that its geometry is planar, which is in agreement
with the judgment from quantum MD simulations.30 It is noted that pentagraphene has an intrinsic out-of-plane
buckling distance of 0.48 Å in our simulation. By excluding the
effect of intrinsic buckling, pentagraphene has the smallest thermal
rippling amplitude (around 0.001 Å). This small height fluctuation
is induced by the fact that in pentagraphene, the in-plane bending
modes, that is, modes involving C–C–C bond angles in
the buckled structure, can accommodate the thermal energy, which is
the same as that in suspended graphene.31 Distinct out-of-plane displacements in T-graphene and S-graphene
with identical tetragons and octagons are present in their unit cells,
which indicates that there is no clear correlation between the averaged
out-of-plane displacement and nonhexagons on the carbon sheets. Furthermore,
other structures containing heptagons and heptagons and octagons also
demonstrate that the percentage of nonhexagons in graphene allotropes
is not closely relative to the averaged out-of-plane displacement.
Instead, the averaged out-of-plane displacement is mainly determined
by the arrangement of carbon polygons on the sheets. In graphene,
few nonhexagons lead to remarkable out-of-plane deformations, while
the out-of-plane wrinkle pattern can be completely suppressed once
the number of nonhexagons reaches to a critical value.32

To illustrate the difference in averaged
out-of-plane displacement
of these sheets in depth, their relaxed morphologies, where the carbon
atoms are colored according to their positions in the normal (z) direction, are captured and are shown in Figure 2c. Distinct structural morphologies
of these relaxed sheets are observed. Both pentagraphene and T-graphene
show a larger wavelength pattern but smaller local curvatures. These
small local curvatures are profited from nondistorted lattices, which
can explain their small averaged out-of-plane displacements. However,
all other structures present not only significant out-of-plane fluctuation
but also large local curvatures, confirming their relatively larger
averaged out-of-plane displacement. The configurations of T-graphene
and S-graphene imply that the arrangement of nonhexagons dominates
the global and local structural morphologies. Interestingly, the out-of-plane
fluctuation of phagraphene and R-haeckelite sheets features 1D wavy
patterns instead of 2D checkerboards observed in other sheets. The
short-wavelength pattern along the y direction in
phagraphene mainly results from the row of dense topological structure
of pentagon–heptagon pairs. However, in the case of R-haeckelite,
a significant long-wavelength pattern is found. Moreover, regularly
small wavelike ripples, that is, well-arranged local wrinkles caused
by the specific arrangement of nonhexagons, are also observed on the
thermal-induced curved surface of H-haeckelite, R-haeckelite, and
HOP graphene sheets, in contrast to those in S-graphene and O-haeckelite.
Overall, the physical origin of the observed fluctuations in these
graphene allotropes containing dense nonhexagons originates from the
coupling of the out-of-plane displacement with the in-plane strain.

Bond Characteristics
Figure 3 shows the distribution profiles of bond
lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles of relaxed graphene allotropes
at a low temperature of 10 K. Unlike graphene, a wide distribution
of bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles and a number of
peaks in the curves are observed. For pentagraphene, the distribution
of bond lengths shows two peaks at around 1.338 and 1.555 Å,
corresponding to the sp2 and sp3 bonds, respectively.
This is in good agreement with that of previous ab initio calculations
by Zhang et al.18 Three peaks at around
97°, 115°, and 139° correspond to bond angles of θC(sp2)–C(sp3)–C(sp2) connecting four pentagons, θC(sp3)–C(sp2)–C(sp2/sp3) in pentagons,
and θC(sp2)–C(sp3)–C(sp2) in pentagons in relaxed pentagraphene, respectively.
Strikingly, different bond angles deviating from 109.471° of
diamond in tetrahedral structures show the distorted C(sp3) character, which is consistent with the previous report
by Zhang et al.18 As indicated by the peaks
in the distribution of dihedral angles in Figure 3c, there also exist different types of dihedral
angles, which are approximately 0°, 9°, and 16° in
pentagons and 99°, 125°, 134°, and 151° connecting
pentagons. These dihedral angles correspond to θC(sp3)–C(sp2)–C(sp2)–C(sp3), θC(sp2)–C(sp2)–C(sp3)–C(sp2) #1, and
θC(sp2)–C(sp2)–C(sp3)–C(sp2) #2 in pentagons and θC(sp2)–C(sp2)–C(sp3)–C(sp2) #1, θC(sp3)–C(sp2)–C(sp3)–C(sp2), θC(sp3)–C(sp2)–C(sp2)–C(sp3), and θC(sp2)–C(sp2)–C(sp3)–C(sp2) #2 connecting pentagons. Different
dihedral angles in pentagons suggest that pentagons in pentagraphene
are nonplanar. By inspecting the cases of T-graphene and S-graphene
made of tetragons and octagons, distinct distributions of bond length,
bond angle, and dihedral angle are observed, indicating multiplicity
of carbon. Three types of bonds, which are about 1.41 Å for octagons
and 1.49 and 1.50 Å shared by tetragons and octagons, respectively,
exist in T-graphene, whereas some types of bonds are in S-graphene
because of broad distribution of bond lengths. Similarly, three types
of bond angles, which are around 90° in tetragons and 134°
and 136° in octagons, are observed in T-graphene. Two sharp peaks
at 0° and 180° found in the distribution of dihedral angles
of T-graphene indicate its locally planar surface structure. Whereas
broad distribution of dihedral angles of S-graphene implies its locally
wrinkled morphology, confirming the results presented in Figure 2c. However, for other
sheets including pentagons and heptagons, complicated distributions
of bond length, bond angle, and dihedral angle were observed in Figure 3. In short, bond
lengths and bond angles of all graphene allotropes deviating from
1.42 Å and 120° of graphene suggest that an intrinsic strain
is introduced in their internal structures, resulting in a decrease
in the stability relative to graphene. Additionally, dihedral angles
deviating from 0° or 180° explain the out-of-plane atomic
displacements.

angle, and (c) dihedral angle for the nine relaxed graphene allotropes.

Tensile Mechanical Properties
In this subsection, the
tensile mechanical characteristics of these 2D sheets are investigated. Figure 4 shows their stress–strain
relationships under uniaxial tensile loading along the x and y directions at a low temperature of 10 K.
Apparently, all graphene allotropes exhibit strongly distinct nonlinear
behaviors, and three or four different deformation regimes can be
identified, depending on the structures of graphene allotropes and
tensile directions.

Figure 4 Tensile mechanical stress–strain diagrams of (a)
pentagraphene
and (b) T-graphene subjected to uniaxial deformation along the x and xy directions, respectively, as well
as (c) S-graphene, (d) pentahexoctite, (e) HOP graphene, (f) phagraphene,
(g) R-haeckelite, (h) H-haeckelite, and (i) O-haeckelite subjected
to uniaxial tensile loads along the x and y directions at a low temperature of 10 K.

In the first regime, tensile stiffness in S-graphene,
phagraphene,
R-haeckelite, H-haeckelite, and O-haeckelite structures increases
with an increasing strain, similar to the characteristics of entropic
elastic responses of thin membranes. The wrinkles with large out-of-plane
displacements as a result of the presence of nonhexagonal rings and
thermal fluctuations are responsible for the entropic elasticity.
This behavior is also found in polycrystalline graphene.33 Furthermore, as shown in Figure 4c,f,i, the stress–strain relationships
of S-graphene, phagraphene, and O-haeckelite demonstrate strong chirality-dependent
tensile stiffness. Feature of 1D wave-formed ripples in these relaxed
structures is mainly attributed to initially different mechanical
responses; stretching of the structures along the ripple direction
leads to high tensile stiffness, whereas low tensile stiffness is
observed when they are strained perpendicular to the ripple direction.
Graphene allotropes with small out-of-plane fluctuations, including
pentagraphene, T-graphene, pentahexoctite, and HOP graphene, are observed
to follow almost initially linear stress–strain responses.
Therefore, nanoscale dewrinkling is the main deformation mechanism
in the first regime. In the second regime, as the strain increases,
the tensile stress nonlinearly increases up to a maximum value, referred
to as maximum tensile strength. The wrinkles in the sheets are largely
flattened by the applied deformation in this phase. The C–C
bonds nonparallel to the stretching direction are directly stretched,
whereas those perpendicular to the tensile direction are contracted.
Particularly, abrupt drops or plateau of tensile stress occurring
in the loading curves implies the occurrence of structural transformations
in the sheets caused by excessive deformation. No plastic deformation
occurs during this straining process. In the third regime, a deepest
drop of tensile stress in the stress–strain curves occurs,
except in the case of pentagraphene. Such a reduction in tensile stress
indicates the failure of the sheets due to fracture. The fourth deformation
regime exclusively points at pentagraphene and T-graphene. It is observed
from Figure 4 that,
among others, pentagraphene and T-graphene exhibit apparent features
of ductile characteristics in the loading curves for both tension
directions. Interestingly, differing from other sheets, pentagraphene
can still endure large strain after fracture at a strain of around
0.12, and the load stress does not decline but oscillates between
values of 5–8 and 8–11 N/m under the x and y tensile directions, respectively. This suggests
that the structure undergoes a series of repeating process of local
strain and local stress relaxation, exhibiting superplastic deformation
behavior. Moreover, prior to the deepest drop of tensile stress at
a large strain of around 0.5, a steep increase in tensile stress appears
in the loading curves of pentagraphene as the applied strain is augmented,
which is indicative of stretching a stable as-formed structure.

Mechanical parameters such as Young’s modulus, ultimate
tensile strengths, and fracture strains as well as available data
from the literature18,20−24 are shown in Table 1 for comparison. Effective Young’s modulus is
determined by fitting the linear regime of the stress–strain
curves, instead of the initial elasticity caused by the entropic effect.
Although there is some scatter in the previously reported results
by density functional theory (DFT), the results by Reax forcefield
(ReaxFF) MD calculations in this study are almost consistent with
them, except for T-graphene under xy-uniaxial tension.
As can be seen in Table 1, all investigated sheets show desirable tensile properties in terms
of in-plane stiffness and tensile strength. Moreover, anisotropic
tensile properties in these 2D sheets can be identified, mainly attributed
to their topological structures. These sheets can be sorted in terms
of x-directional tension in-plane stiffness from
the highest to the lowest values of Young’s modulus as phagraphene
> R-haeckelite > H-haeckelite > HOP graphene > pentahexoctite
> O-haeckelite
> pentagraphene > T-graphene > S-graphene, whereas for y/xy-directional tension, they can be sorted
as T-graphene
> H-haeckelite > S-graphene > R-haeckelite > O-haeckelite
> phagraphene
> HOP graphene > pentagraphene > pentahexoctite. In terms
of x-directional tensile strength from the highest
to the lowest
values, they are sorted as phagraphene > HOP graphene > pentahexoctite
> R-haeckelite > H-haeckelite > O-haeckelite > T-graphene
> pentagraphene
> S-graphene, whereas in the case of y/xy direction, they can be sorted as phagraphene > T-graphene
> O-haeckelite
> pentahexoctite > R-haeckelite > H-haeckelite > S-graphene
> HOP
graphene > pentagraphene. The large fracture strain observed in
phagraphene
and O-haeckelite is due to their highly wrinkled morphology.

These findings indicate that an atomically
structural morphology
dominates the mechanical properties of graphene allotropes, although
previous studies suggested that mechanical and physical properties
of 2D nanomaterials can be finely tuned by surface chemical functionalization.34,35

Effect of Structures on Tensile Mechanical Behaviors
Structural
parameters such as bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral
angles are the three important factors that control the deformation
of these 2D materials. Figures 3, 5, and S1–S8 (see Supporting Information) show the
distribution profiles of bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles
at different tensile strains for the graphene allotropes subjected
to two different uniaxial directions. For all structures, as the applied
strain is augmented in the elastic regime, specific peak in the curves
of distribution of bond lengths and bond angles splits up into two
or more sharp peaks, and changes in the position of the peaks simultaneously
happen. When the tensile strain exceeds a critical value, a change
in both the number and the position of the peaks occurs, and sharpness
of the peaks decreases. To give a more clear picture of the bond and
bond angle deformation, typically local snapshots of pentagraphene
at several critical strains under both x- and xy-uniaxial elongations are, respectively, captured, as
shown in Figures 5d
and 6d. As presented in Figure 5d, elastic elongation of pentagraphene along
the x direction leads to distinct variations in the
length of 4 equiv C–C bonds in a pentagon; two bonds that are
placed to be small angles to the tension direction are stretched;
however, the other two ones that make large angles along the straining
direction are contracted. This explains the decomposition of one peak
at 1.555 Å presented in Figure 5a. Contrarily, length in unique bond constructed by
sp2 carbons in pentagons monotonically increases with an
increase in the strain. Similarly, in the case of xy-uniaxial direction, atomic bonds in pentagons, which make small
angles or are parallel to the stretching direction, have a significant
contribution to the applied strain. Intriguingly, as the sheet is
deformed beyond a strain of 0.09, the bonds originally perpendicular
to the tension direction realign. This deformation mechanism results
in a sudden bond transformation of the adjacent bonds. Such a bond
realignment confirmed by horizontal solid lines across the snapshots
in Figure 6d explains
the first drop in load stress, as observed in Figure 4a, as well as the distinct changes in the
distribution profiles of bond lengths presented in Figure 6a.

the structural transition from pentagons to octagons as a result of
dissociation of two C–C bonds (marked by two arrows). C–C

One C–C bond in the zoomed-in structure with a strain of 0.09
can be identified to be nonparallel to the horizontal solid line,
implying the appearance of nonuniformly local strain for 2 equiv bonds
of pentagons. One arrow in the left-bottom snapshot points out the
dissociation of one C–C bond due to excessive local strain.
Specifically, neighboring polygons dyed by colors in bottom snapshots
clearly illustrate the transition of pentagon to hexagon in overstretched
pentagraphene. C–C bonds are colored according to their bond
length.

In addition to bond stretching
and contraction, great angular and
torsional deformations indicated by Figures 5b,c and 6b,c, where
significant deviations of the characteristic bond angles and dihedral
angles relative to the initial states are observed, also help accommodating
the applied tensile strain. These microstructural changes can also
be confirmed by the analysis of local atomic shear strains (Figure
S9 in Supporting Information). The maximum
ratio of bond stretch to bond angle bending for all sheets under elastic
deformation is plotted in Figure S10 in the Supporting Information. From Figure S10, it
is revealed that the interplay among bond stretch, bond angle bending,
and lattice orientation determines the tensile properties such as
in-plane stiffness, tensile strength, and fracture strain. For example,
although pentagraphene has identical values of maximum ratio of bond
stretch (from 1.555 to 1.711 Å) under exposure to the two directional
elongations, larger maximum ratio of bond angle bending under x-directional tension produces higher tensile strength and
fracture strain. Furthermore, significant difference in the structural
load distributions for the two uniaxial tensions demonstrates disparate
failure modes. For the x-directional tension, excessive
external load causes dissociation of one of the highly stretched bonds
in pentagons, yielding sp2-carbon octagons in which one
atom is connected by only two atoms, as illustrated by color-filled
polygons in Figure 5d. Such a production of octagons is also accompanied by a rapid structural
transition of sp2/sp3-carbon pentagons to other
sp2-carbon polygons. These structural transformations are
also greatly hinted by huge changes in the distribution profiles of
bond, bond angle, and dihedral angles. For the xy-directional tension, the highly stretched bond in pentagons is broken
in the same manner as the applied load stress exceeds the strength
of C(sp2)–C(sp3) bond. Such a bond dissociation, however, does not lead to the formation
of an octagon. Instead, two new bonds form between two pentagons shared
by the dissociated bond, resulting in a structural transition from
two adjacent pentagons to a hexagon plus two trigons, as shown in
the bottom snapshots of Figure 6d. Likewise, distribution profiles of bond, bond angles, and
dihedral angles dramatically change, as shown in Figure 6a–c. More interestingly,
when elongation is further applied, two intact bonds on the two metastable
trigons immediately dissociate, yielding two newly adjacent hexagons.
Ideally, perfect graphene can be acquired from pentagraphene by the
stepwise xy-directional strain-triggered structural
transformations, which are consistent with the energy-favorable route
proposed by Ewels et al.36 Notably, classic
MD simulation in this study demonstrates a clear dynamic process of
the structural transformations, contrasting with the prediction by
static DFT calculations at the ground state.36

To provide more insights into the changes in polygonal topologies
during structural transformations in the pentagraphene, ring statistics
of the polygons with a size ranging from trigons to decagons in sheets
with the applied strain is analyzed. Figure 7 compares relationships between percentages
of C3–C10 polygons to overall carbon
polygons in the pentagraphene and tensile strain along the x and xy directions, respectively, as well
as their typical snapshots at critical strains. Clearly, within the
elastic limit, pentagons dominate the ring statistics along both tension
directions, as shown in Figure 7a,b. Beyond the elastic limits, the ratio of hexagon to all
polygons reduces in a stepwise manner as strain increases up to around
0.4. Inversely, the stepwise increase in the ratio of other types
of polygons to all polygons occurs in the deformation phase, quantitatively
describing the dissociation of sp3-carbon-contained pentagons
accompanied by the formation of various sp2-carbon polygons.
Such stepwise changes in percentages of various polygons correspond
to the oscillations of load stress in the curves shown in Figure 4a. As the applied
strain exceeds 0.4, the ratios of each type of polygon to all polygons
remain nearly constant, indicating the accomplishment of structural
transformations. However, significantly quantitative discrepancies
in the ratios of each polygon to all polygons in completely frustrated
pentagraphene along the x and xy directions reveal strikingly distinct scenarios of structural transformations,
as hinted by bottom snapshots in Figures 5d and 6d. For the x-directional tension, the completely frustrated pentagraphene
is composed of sp2-carbon pentagons (25.5%), hexagons (28.2%),
heptagons (22.5%), and octagons (14.2%), whereas for the xy-directional stretch, only the hexagon (approximately 76%) mainly
dominates the polygon statistics, as visually demonstrated in Figure 7c,d. Such a distinct
disparity is attributed to markedly different scenarios in the distribution
of atomic stress on frustrated and intact zones of pentagraphene.
The atoms located at just frustrated zone have higher von Mises stress
than those at intact one along the x direction; however,
high atomic von Mises stress is concentrated on intact pentagraphene
along the xy direction, as shown in Figure S11 in
the Supporting Information. As a result,
steep stress gradient occurs at the mismatched heterointerfaces, as
clearly illustrated by the zoomed-in snapshots in Figure S11, which enhances the strain-induced structural transitions
in pentagraphene. This is also indicated by the magnitude of the averaged
load stress in the curves shown in Figure 4a, where larger oscillations of load stress
are observed for the x-directional tension than those
observed for the xy-directional tension. Additionally,
the hexagon-dominated structure explains an observation of large load
stress at the end of elongation for the xy-directional
tension. Heterointerfaces between intact and frustrated pentagraphene
are locally wrinkled because of the difference in their planarity.
Interestingly, different width in the in-plane transverse direction
perpendicular to tension direction between intact and frustrated pentagraphene
causes the in-plane transverse tensile/compressive stress as a result
of the intrinsic difference in their planar atomic densities. As shown
in Figure S12, for the x-directional tension, small height of ripples in frustrated pentagraphene
suggests that it is biaxially stretched, in contrast with that for
the xy-directional strain. This again indicates the
tension direction dependence of large-scale structural transformations
in pentagraphene.

Figure 7 Strain-induced large-scale structural transformations
in pentagraphene.
Variation in the percentages of C3–C10 polygons to overall carbon polygons in pentagraphene with the applied
uniaxial strain along (a) x and (b) xy directions. Tension-dependent large-scale structural transformations
in pentagraphene are attributed to a significant difference in the
ratios of each polygon to all polygons. Intermediate heterostructures
composed of frustrated and intact pentagraphene form during the structural
transformation. Formation of hexagons during the deformation is limited
by the angular constraint of simulation box to some extent. Typical
snapshots of pentagraphene at critical strains when uniaxial tension
is applied along (c) x and (d) xy directions. Two typical microstructures in the fully fractured pentagraphene
are intentionally captured to distinguish structural transitions caused
by straining along the x and xy directions.
Carbon atoms are dyed according to one type of topologically polygonal
ring constructed by them, in line with those of the corresponding
curves.

For comparison, analysis of polygon
statistics in other carbon
sheets as a function of the applied strain is also performed, as presented
in Figures 8a,b, 9a,b, and S13–S18 in the Supporting Information. All curves show a sharp change in
the percentages of C3–C10 polygon to
overall polygons, implying their initial failures caused by stretch.
Posterior to the sudden change in ring statistics, the number of polygons,
including the newly formed ones, levels off soon. It is also evident
that the change in the ratios of the dominated polygons to overall
polygons on these carbon sheets is significantly smaller than that
on pentagraphene. These suggest a lower tensile ductility than that
of pentagraphene. Intriguingly, pentahexoctite, HOP graphene, phagraphene,
and O-haeckelite show an apparent increase in the ratio of one originally
dominated polygon to all polygons beyond the initial fracture strain
for one specific tension direction, indicating direction-dependent
failure mechanisms. To reveal the failure mechanisms of these carbon
sheets, several snapshots of graphene allotropes excluding pentagraphene
subjected to two different directional strains are captured and are
shown in Figures 8c,d, 9c,d, and S19–S26. On the basis of the patterns of fracture edges, it is found that
S-graphene shows brittle failures (straight crack) for both tension
directions, whereas phagraphene can show either brittle or semibrittle
fracture, depending on the tension direction, and pentahexoctite,
HOP graphene, phagraphene, R-haeckelite, and H-haeckelite demonstrate
direction-independent semibrittle failures. Notably, T-graphene shows
ductile failure for both tension directions, as illustrated by Figure 9c,d, where large
numbers of decagons (around 10%) via breakage of bonds shared by tetra-
and octagons form in T-graphene for both tension directions prior
to deadly fracture. In particular, O-haeckelite, with an exception,
shows either brittle or ductile plastic deformations, depending on
the tension directions. For the x-directional tension,
structural transition from quite limited Stone–Thrower–Wales
(or 5775) defects to crystalline structures with hexagonal (6666)
topology (<2%) via bond rotation opens cracks to complete fracture
(Figure 9c), whereas
for the y-directional stretch, a decagonal structure
forms over a large area in T-graphene because of dissociation of bonds
shared by adjacent pentagons in facilitating excessive deformation
(Figure 9d). It can
be concluded that failure patterns in graphene allotropes are strongly
sensitive to their structural morphologies and tension directions.

are captured at several critical strains when uniaxial tension is
applied along (c) x and (d) xy directions.
One typical microstructure in the bulk pentagraphene is zoomed-in
to clearly show the structural transformation due to bond dissociation.
No difference in the structural transformations between both stretching
directions is detected. Carbon atoms are painted according to one
type of topologically polygonal ring constructed by them, in line
with those of the corresponding curves.

Relationships between percentages of C3–C10 polygons to overall carbon polygons in O-haeckelite and strain when
it is subjected to uniaxial deformation along (a) x and (b) y directions, respectively. Typical snapshots
of O-haeckelite when uniaxial tensile strain is forced along (c) x and (d) y directions, respectively. Two
local microstructures of pentagraphene are captured to reveal the
structural transitions. Limited hexagons close to the cracking edges
form due to bond rotations for x-directional tension,
whereas for the y-directional tension, numbers of
decagons appear as a result of bond dissociations that are shared
by pentagons. Carbon atoms are colored according to one type of topologically
polygonal ring constructed by them, in line with those of the corresponding
curves.

Conclusions
In
this work, we have quantified the structural and in-plane mechanical
properties of nine different graphene allotropes by using large-scale
MD simulations. The calculation results show that the investigated
structures possess higher energies than the indefective graphene.
The sp2-carbon penta-, hexa-, hepta-, and octagon-contained
sheets are energetically comparable. However, great differences are
identified in the surface morphology of all relaxed structures and
in the tension direction-dependent stress–strain responses
that resulted from the arrangement of carbon polygons. Significant
differences are also observed in maximum bond length prior to initial
failures and in the characteristic bond angles and dihedral angles
relative to the initial states, indicating that angular and torsional
deformations also help accommodating the applied tensile strain. Brittle,
semibrittle, and ductile failure patterns are detected in these 2D
structures, and two different failure patterns are observed in S-graphene
and O-haeckelite. Failures occurring in overstretched sheets are associated
with the evolution of packed nonhexagons. Specifically, pentagraphene
exhibits extraordinary stretchability under two different tension
directions, and the high ductility is attributed to two distinct large-scale
structural transitions. This work provides a fundamental understanding
on tensile mechanical characteristics and their relationship with
the structural evolvement of planar carbon nanostructures.

Models and
Methodology
All classic MD simulations are carried out by
using the large-scale
atomic-molecular massively parallel simulator code package.37 The carbon–carbon atomic interactions
in the graphene allotrope systems are described by the first-principles-based
ReaxFF potential in the MD simulations. The ReaxFF is capable of capturing
all possible interactions including covalent terms, Coulomb interactions,
dispersion, and other nonbonding forces. It is also able to handle
chemical reactions, including chemical bond formation and breaking
according to bond order values. Previous studies showed that ReaxFF
accurately predicts the mechanical behaviors of hydrocarbons, CNTs,
graphite, diamond, and other carbon-based nanostructures.38 The version of the ReaxFF developed by Chenoweth
et al.39 is employed in this study. It
is noted that this potential can well-reproduce intrinsic buckling
characteristics of pentagraphene, contradicting that a flat pentagraphene
was described by the reactive empirical bond order potential.40 The buckling distance in the out-of-plane direction
of pentagraphene is determined to be about 0.48 Å, which agrees
with that calculated by ab initio calculations.18

Prior to the uniaxial loading, all isolated graphene-allotropes
are first quasistatically relaxed to a local minimum energy configuration
via the conjugate gradient method with an energy tolerance of 1.0
× 10–4 eV and a force tolerance of 1.0 ×
10–4 eV/Å. A small timestep of 0.1 fs with
the velocity-Verlet integration algorithm is utilized, making sure
that the MD simulation process is stable. Periodic boundary conditions
are applied in planar directions to simulate an infinite sheet, which
eliminates any spurious effects of boundaries during tension. MD relaxations
of 50 ps (500 000 timesteps) are carried out at zero pressure
in planar directions under an NPT ensemble (constant number of particles,
constant pressure, and constant temperature). A temperature of 10
K is considered to limit the influence from temperature fluctuations.
The temperature and pressure are maintained by the Nosé–Hoover
thermostat and barostat method with a damping time of 0.1 and 1 ps,
respectively. Initial velocities of carbon atoms in the systems are
assigned following the Gaussian distribution at the given temperature.

To study the tensile mechanical properties of graphene allotrope
sheets, the tensile loading along the two directions is simulated
by a technology of deformation control under NPT ensembles. It is
noted that, as shown in Figure 1, for the pentagraphene and T-graphene, mechanical loads are
along the x and xy directions. For
other graphene allotropes, mechanical loads are along the x and y directions. A suitable strain rate
of 1.0 × 108/s is chosen in the loading simulations.
The increment in strain is applied to the structures every 1000 timesteps.
The monolayered structures allow the expansion/contraction in a planar
direction that is perpendicular to the loading direction during the
uniaxial deformation under the NPT ensemble. The atomic stress per
atom is calculated based on the virial definition of stress, using
the forces on the atoms collected during the MD simulations.9,10,41 Atomic potential energy and atomic
stress are averaged over 1000 timesteps to limit the oscillations.

For the structural characterization of these stretched sheets,
detailed microstructure features are examined to identify the structural
transformation by exact geometric methods. Using the “shortest
path ring” algorithm developed by Franzblau,42 all of the carbon rings in the modeled structures assuming
minimum and maximum carbon-bonding distances of 1.2 and 1.9 Å,
respectively, are identified. In our calculations, various carbon
rings ranging from trigonal to decagonal motifs are specifically recognized
and counted during the tensile process.
