Foams made with polymer hydrogels
can be used in a variety of applications,
such as scaffolds for biomedical applications or decontamination processes.
However, from a practical point of view, it is difficult to introduce
bubbles into viscous or viscoelastic fluids and to produce large volumes
of hydrogel foams. In the present article, we investigate the foaming
process of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/borax transient hydrogels, where
PVA chains reversibly bind to borax molecules. In a previous article,
we showed that foams obtained with PVA/borax mixtures are highly stable
because of both high interfacial and bulk viscosities and can be used
to quickly absorb liquids, which make them suitable for detergency
or decontamination processes. To produce these foams, we use a two-step
foaming process which consists in first shearing a PVA solution to
obtain a PVA foam and second adding borax to the PVA foam under continuous
shearing. The obtained PVA/borax foams are stable for weeks. In this
study, we observe a shear-induced collapse of the foams for formulations
containing a low borax/PVA ratio, whereas they remain stable under
shear for high PVA/borax ratios. Using scaling arguments, we find
that the shear-induced collapse of the foams and bubbles is obtained
below a critical ratio, NE/NB = 15, of the number of entanglements per chain, NE, and the number of borax per chain, NB. Rheology measurements show that the samples
present a shear-thickening behavior that increases with the borax
concentration. We suggest that during the foaming process when the
shearing rate is of the order of 100 s–1, the viscosity
of these samples diverges, leading to a viscous to fragile transition.
To mimic the fast stretching of the PVA/borax thin films during the
foaming process, we study the stretching of individual PVA/borax catenoid-shaped
thin films at high stretching rates. We observe that the films containing
low PVA/borax ratios do not minimize their surface area unlike what
is theoretically expected for standard surfactant films. Moreover,
the films tend to be unstable and fracture because the PVA/borax network
does not have time to rearrange and relax stresses for high stretching
rates.

1 Introduction
Foams, which are composed of air bubbles in a continuous matrix,
are commonly used in multiple applications such as cosmetics and detergency
and also as precursors for the production of lightweight materials.
However, foams made with standard surfactants have a limited lifetime
because of three destabilization mechanisms, that is, the gravity-induced
drainage flow of the continuous phase, Ostwald ripening, and bubble
coalescence. Complex fluids such as polymer or peptide hydrogels1−8 or colloidal suspensions9−14 can be used to produce highly stable foams as their high viscosity
enables to slow down the drainage flow. Hydrogel foams were recently
used for biological applications such as wound healing and tissue
culture.5,6 In a recent article, we showed that foams
made of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/borax physical hydrogels can be
used to quickly absorb liquids, which make them good candidates for
a wide range of detergency applications, including decontamination
during the dismantling of nuclear facilities. In the latter application,
the high viscosity of the PVA/borax mixtures enables to obtain foams
that can remain highly stable during long decontamination processes.
However, foams made with hydrogels are delicate to produce and handle.
Indeed, their high viscosity and elasticity prevent the incorporation
of air bubbles during the foaming process. Moreover, the handling
and processing of foams made with covalent hydrogels are delicate
because hydrogels are fragile and tend to fracture very easily.

The most current knowledge on foaming science is for Newtonian
fluids,15 and there is very little knowledge
concerning foams made with complex fluids, although they would help
producing new types of aerated materials with a controlled structure.
During the mechanical foaming of standard surfactant solutions, the
foam volume and air fraction are controlled by the amount of air which
is trapped into the fluid, whereas the bubble size distribution is
controlled by the balance between bubble breakup and bubble coalescence
which occurs as the bubbles and the fluid are sheared. The deformation
and breakup of a single bubble in a shear flow are controlled by the
capillary number, Ca, which is a balance of capillary
and viscous forces acting on the bubble. Grace16 showed that the breakup of a single bubble in a Newtonian
fluid in a shear flow occurs above a critical capillary number, Cac, whose value depends on the viscosity of
the bulk phase. However, it was recently shown that in foams, that
is, concentrated assemblies of bubbles, bubble breakup occurs for
much lower capillary numbers.17 It is likely
that the thin films between the bubbles play a role in this behavior.15 Indeed, in a sheared foam, the thin liquid films
between the bubbles are strongly deformed and topological rearrangements
of bubbles occur,18,19 which lead to bubble coalescence
in very thin films.20,21

In this article, we study
the foaming of transient polymer networks
made with PVA/borax mixtures as well as the stability of the obtained
foams under shear. PVA/borax mixtures are non-Newtonian shear-thickening
fluids, whose viscosity increases with the shear rate and whose rheological
properties can be tuned with the PVA/borax composition. We showed
in a recent article that PVA/borax transient networks can be used
to produce foams with an ultraslow rate of drainage because of high
bulk and interfacial viscosities.1 To produce
these foams, we used a two-step foaming process, where a PVA solution
is first foamed and then a borax solution is added to the PVA foam
under shear to obtain the PVA/borax foams. In the present article,
we show that the PVA/borax foams with low PVA/borax ratios become
highly unstable and collapse while they are sheared. Using scaling
arguments, we find that the shear-induced collapse of the foams and
bubbles is obtained below a critical ratio, NE/NB = 15, of the number of entanglements
per chain, NE, and the number of borax
per chain, NB. Rheology measurements show
that below this critical NE/NB ratio, the viscosity of the samples diverges. We suggest
that the shear-induced collapse of the foams is due to the fact that
the PVA/borax solutions are shear thickening and that the thin films
undergo a viscous to fragile transition break as they are stretched
during the foaming process, leading to a coalescence of the bubbles.
A series of catenoid-shaped thin-film stretching experiments show
that the thin films break as they are stretched at high velocity below
a critical PVA/borax ratio, which is much higher than the critical
ratio for foam collapse.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials
Sodium
tetraborate decahydrate,
Na2B4O7·10H2O, or
borax is purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification.
In water, it dissociates into Na+ and B(OH)4–. PVA of various molar masses and degrees of hydrolysis was purchased
from either Sigma-Aldrich or Polyscience (Table 1). The entanglement concentration C* was obtained using rheology measurements as explained
below. The PVA solutions with concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 15
wt % are heated to 85 °C under vigorous stirring for 3 hours
to reach total polymer dissolution and then cooled to room temperature
before use. For all PVA/borax mixtures, borax solutions are added
to a 10-fold greater volume of PVA solution such that final borax
concentrations are found to approximately range from 0.1 to 0.5 wt
%.

2.2 Foam Preparation
PVA solution (200
g) is placed into the bowl of a kitchen mixer (Kenwood KWY90) and
sheared (Figure 1a)
at a maximal speed (100 s–1) for 3 min. PVA, which
is a surface-active polymer—having a surface tension of around
45 mN/m—is indeed a very good foaming agent and we obtain 3–4
L of low-density fine foam (bubble size 400 μm, volume fraction
of air from 93 to 95%). After the PVA foam is obtained, an appropriate
volume of borax solution at a concentration 10 times the final one
is added to the PVA foam under continuous mixing for time varying
between 10 and 180 s. To ensure good homogeneity of the PVA/borax
gel, we add rhodamine to the borax solution and find that 10 s is
enough to homogenize the foam. The air fraction is measured by measuring
the weight of a given volume of the foam.

Figure 1 (a) Two-step foaming
process: a PVA solution is foamed using a
mixer and borax is then added to the foam and (b) borate anion can
form a complex with two PVA chains and create a transient cross-link.
During the foaming process, the shear rate is of the order of 100
s–1. This is reproduced from Deleurence et al.,1 with the permission of the Royal Society of Chemistry.

2.3 Rheological Measurements
Rheological
measurements of PVA/borax solutions are carried out with a AR-G2 rheometer
(TA Instruments) using a cone-plate geometry (cone angle 2°,
diameter 40 mm, and truncation 52 μm). All measurements are
made at 25 °C and with a solvent trap to avoid evaporation. The
value of C*, the entanglement concentration, was
obtained by measuring the steady shear viscosity as a function of
the bulk concentration. The change of the exponent of the viscosity
variation with respect to the concentration indicates C*. The PVA/borax gel is prepared by mixing PVA and borax and gently
stirring the sample.

2.4 Catenoid Stretching Experiments
To
mimic the stretching of foam bubbles during the foaming process where
the foams are sheared, we performed an experiment where a catenoid-shaped
thin film is stretched. In this setup (Figure 2), two rings made of stainless steel (internal
diameter, 2R = 15 mm, thickness 5 mm) are dipped
into the PVA solution and some of the solution is collected between
the two rings. The rings are then withdrawn from the solution and
pulled apart by 1 cm to form a catenoid thin film. The PVA amount
is measured by weighing the rings after dipping them in the PVA solution.
Borax is then added dropwise onto the film (the homogeneity of the
film is checked by adding a dye, rhodamine, to the borax solution).
Then, the catenoid is stretched by letting the bottom ring fall. The
resultant stretching velocity increases to approximately 450 mm/s,
corresponding to a stretching rate of the order of 40 s–1. Using a high-speed camera, we then extract the neck radius, a, and the distance, h, between the rings.

PVA/borax mixtures.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Rheological Properties
of the PVA/Borax Samples
In Figure 3a,b,
we present the rheological measurements obtained for solutions of
PVA 5% with increasing borax concentrations. The PVA 5% solution with
no borax behaves like a purely Newtonian viscous fluid. The solution,
which contains 0.1% borax, has a weak shear elastic modulus, but its
flow curve shows a constant viscosity with the shear rate. For 0.2
and 0.4% borax, the samples are viscoelastic, with G′ and G″ crossing at a frequency ωc of the order of 5–10 rad s–1. The
corresponding samples present a sharp increase of the viscosity at
a high shear rate. The shear-thickening behavior appears at a strain
rate of about ωc, evidencing that if the system does
not have the time to relax its links, it undergoes a strong shear
thickening. The shear-thickening behavior of PVA/borax solutions was
reported previously.22 Above 20 s–1, it becomes impossible to measure the viscosity as the samples get
ejected from the rheometer gap.

(b) Flow curves of PVA 5% with increasing borax concentrations. (c)
Flow curves of PVA 5 and 10% with 0.2 and 0.4% borax. At high shear
rates, the samples get sometimes ejected from the rheometer, preventing
any measurement. The dotted lines represent the evolution of the viscosity
that we expect with respect to the collapse of the foams.

In Figure 3c, we
present flow curves obtained for two PVA concentrations, 5 and 10%,
and two borax concentrations of 0.2 and 0.4%. For a given borax concentration,
the shear thickening is less pronounced for the highest PVA concentration.
Similar to us, Liu et al.23 observed that
the shear-thickening behavior of another type of polymer transient
networks can be reduced by increasing the polymer concentration with
a fixed cross-linker concentration.

3.2 Shear
Instability of PVA/Borax Foams
The PVA/borax foams are produced
in a two-step process consisting
in shearing a PVA solution using a kitchen mixer and then adding the
borax under continuous shearing. For a given range of PVA/borax compositions,
the sheared PVA/borax foams become highly unstable during the shearing
process. Figure 4 provides
an example of such a shear-induced collapse of the foams. For a foam
containing 7.5% wt PVA (Mowiol 8-88) and 0.4% of borax, the air fraction
drops from 92 to 25% after 60 s of shear and the foam volume falls
quickly. However, for a foam containing the same PVA concentration
with only 0.1% wt of borax, the air fraction and foam volume remain
stable while the foam is sheared over 3 min.

Figure 4 Evolution of the air
fraction of the PVA/borax foams as a function
of the mixing time for a shear rate of 100 s–1.
The two photos show the quantity of the foam obtained in the mixing
bowl in two mixtures containing 0.1 and 0.4% wt borax. For 0.4% borax,
the volume of the foam collapses after 3 min of shear. These results
are obtained for Mowiol 8-88 at 7.5% wt.

Figure 5a–c
shows a phase diagram of the stability of these PVA/borax foams—under
shear and at rest—as a function of the borax concentration
obtained for different PVA molar masses and degrees of hydrolysis.
Three types of behaviors are observed on the phase diagram. At low
PVA and borax concentrations (zone I), the PVA/borax foams are stable
under shear; however, the obtained foams have a limited stability
in time, below 1 day. In zone II, the PVA/borax foams are highly unstable
and collapse when they are sheared as illustrated in Figure 4. In zone III, corresponding
to the highest PVA concentrations, the foams remain stable when they
are sheared and the corresponding foams are stable, up to 4 weeks
for the highest PVA/borax concentrations in zone III, as reported
in our previous article.1

Figure 5 (a–c) Phase diagrams
summarizing the stability of the PVA/borax
foams at rest and under shear. (a) and (b) are obtained for Mowiol
8-88 and 4-88, respectively. (c) is obtained for PVA of various degrees
of hydrolysis and molar masses. [B–] is the borax
concentration, DP is the degree of polymerization, C is the PVA concentration, and C* is the entanglement
concentration. The axis has been renormalized following refs (25)–28 to account for variations
of the molar mass and C* among the samples.

We note that when the mixer speed
is reduced to its minimum, corresponding
to a shear rate of approximately 20 s–1, the frontier
moves toward higher borax concentrations. These results show that
the collapse of the foams during mixing depends on the composition
and on the mixing velocity.

Combining the rheology measurements
and the foam collapse observations,
we suggest that the foam collapse during the mixing process is caused
by a strong increase of the viscosity during the mixing which leads
to a ductile to fragile transition, similarly to what was observed
in other polymer transient networks.24 Below,
we discuss in more detail the influence of the composition on the
shear-thickening behavior and foam collapse.

3.3 Frontiers
between Zones I, II, and III
The gelation of PVA/borax mixtures
was studied in refs (25)–28. Keita
and Ricard28 investigated experimentally
and theoretically
the sol/gel transition of PVA/borax mixtures. Above the gel point,
the PVA chains form a percolated network. Their experimental gel point
curve, which represents the critical borax concentration for gelation
as a function of C/C*, is very close
to the frontier that we measure between zone I and zones II/III in Figure 5c, suggesting that
in zone I the PVA/borax mixtures are below the percolation point.

Keita and Ricard predicted that the shape of the gel point curve
is obtained as follows: the gel point is reached if all PVA chains
contain at least one cross-link, either a PVA/borax/PVA dicomplex
or an entanglement between two PVA chains. The latter condition is
written theoretically as 1  with [B–] the concentration
in borate anions, DP the degree of polymerization of the PVA chains, C the PVA concentration, and C* the overlap
concentration above which PVA chains start overlapping. In our case,
we find the frontier of zone I is well-described by the following
equation: 2  with A = 5. Equation 2 enables us to obtain a divergence
of the borax needed to obtain gelation for C = C*, a condition which is observed experimentally both in
our case and in Keita’s case.

For PVA and borax concentrations
above the gel point such that , the foams are either stable (zone
III)
or unstable (zone II) during the mixing process depending on the PVA/borax
composition.

Interestingly, the frontier between zones II and
III corresponds
to a critical ratio of the number of entanglements and borax links
per chain. The number of borax per polymer chain, NB, and the number of entanglements, NE, per polymer chains are written, respectively, as25−27 3  and 4  

The dashed
frontier between zones II and III shown in Figure 5c is obtained using
a critical ratio NE/NB = 15. Hence, the shear-induced coalescence of the foams
is obtained when NE/NB < 15.

We note that when the mixer speed is
reduced to its minimum, corresponding
to a shear rate of approximately 20 s–1, the critical
ratio decreases down to NE/NB = 7. This means that when the mixing velocity is lower,
the frontier moves toward higher borax concentrations (Table 2).

In Table 2, we indicate
the foam collapse observations made for two mixing velocities equal
to 20 and 100 s–1 for the four PVA/borax solutions
whose flow curves are given in Figure 3c (PVA 5 and 10% with borax 0.2 or 0.4%). The solutions
containing 5% of PVA with 0.2 or 0.4% borax collapse at mixing velocities
of both 20 and 100 s–1, which can be correlated
to the strong increase of the viscosity starting before 20 s–1. The ejection of the sample at a high shear rate makes the viscosity
measurement impossible, but the dotted lines in Figure 3c are a suggestion for the viscosity evolution
that we expect for these two samples at a high shear rate. The foam
containing PVA 10% and borax 0.2% is stable at 20 and 100 s–1, which can be attributed to the slow increase of the viscosity with
the shear rate. Finally, the foam containing 10% of PVA and 0.4% of
borax is stable for a mixing velocity of 20 s–1 but
collapses if the mixing velocity is increased to 100 s–1. As suggested by the dotted lines in Figure 3c, a weak increase of the viscosity up to
20 s–1 followed by a sharp increase of the viscosity
above 20 s–1 could explain such a behavior.

Table 2 Foam Collapse Observations for the
Same Concentrations as in Figure 3c
 	 	20 s–1	100 s–1	
borax 0.4%	PVA 10%	stable	collapse	
 	PVA 5%	collapse	collapse	
borax 0.2%	PVA 10%	stable	stable	
 	PVA 5%	collapse	collapse	
We note that the foams containing 5% PVA and
0.1% borax which are
not shear thickening (Figure 3b) are noted as unstable in Figure 5c. In fact, the foam observations were not
reproducible for this specific sample, which lies close to the frontiers
between zones I, II, and III, where the homogenization of the samples
is probably critical.

3.4 Stretching Catenoids of
PVA/Borax Mixtures
When a foam is sheared, the thin liquid
films between the bubbles
are either stretched or compressed. To mimic the stretching of thin
liquid films inside the foams during the shearing process, we performed
a series of experiments which consist in a fast stretching of catenoid-shaped
films made with PVA/borax mixtures.

In Figure 6, we present the shape variation of catenoids
made from PVA 8-88 10% with borax concentrations between 0 and 0.4%.
Along with images of the catenoids, we present the variation of a/R as a function of h/R, where a is the neck radius, R is the radius of the catenoid at the rings, and h is the height of the catenoid. The dashed line corresponds to the
theoretical shape of a surfactant catenoid under quasi-static conditions,
which corresponds to a minimal surface area.29 Theoretically, a surfactant catenoid becomes unstable for h/R above 1.33. The behavior of the catenoids
containing only PVA is very close to the theoretical dashed line for h/R up to 1.3. However, we note that the
rupture of the catenoids is delayed and occurs for h/R = 1.8 probably because of the fast stretching
rate and of the relatively high viscosity of the PVA solution in comparison
to that of standard surfactant films. The destabilization of the films
is delayed. For increasing borax concentrations to 0.4%, the shape
of the catenoids deviates from the theoretical prediction more and
more significantly. Indeed, a/R is
higher than expected for a given h/R, meaning that the surface area is not minimal. Moreover, the catenoids
break for lower values of h/R as
the borax concentration is increased. These simple experiments show
that the thin liquid films containing PVA/borax mixtures undergo a
viscous to brittle transition as the borax concentration increases.

Figure 6 Stretching
of the catenoids and values of a/R as a function of h/R for catenoid
films containing 10% of PVA 8-88 solutions and increasing
amounts of borax, from 0% to 0.4%. The crosses represent the deformation
at which the films break.

The deviation from minimal surface conditions and fragility
of
the thin films upon stretching are related to the ability of the PVA/borax
transient network to rearrange in the catenoid films. We suggest that
for PVA/borax mixtures for which the viscosity diverges strongly at
high deformation rates, the PVA/borax network cannot flow to minimize
their surface energy and become brittle. We therefore suggest that
the shear-induced collapse of the foams that we observe during the
foaming process is due to the rupture of thin liquid films as they
are strongly stretched. We note that the critical borax concentration
for which the fracture of the catenoids occurs for a critical ratio NE/NB = 150, well
above the ratio of 15 or 7, is found in the shearing foam experiments
for 100 or 20 s–1, showing that the thin films undergo
a viscous to fragile transition for much lower borax concentrations
than in the foams. Moreover, for 0.1% borax, the catenoid films undergo
a fragile breakup, although the foams are stable during the mixing
process, and the solutions do not present any shear-thickening behavior
(see Supporting Information S1). The catenoid
experiment is a purely extensional flow, in contrary to the shear
rheology experiments, and the elongational viscosity of these PVA/borax
systems may be much larger than their shear viscosity.

4 Conclusions
In this article, we investigate the foaming process of foams made
with PVA/borax transient networks. To produce these foams, we used
a two-step foaming process, where a PVA solution is first foamed,
and then a borax solution is added to the PVA foam under shear to
obtain the PVA/borax foams. For formulations with a low PVA/borax
ratio, we observe a shear-induced collapse of the foams. For high
PVA/borax ratios, the foams remain stable under shear (mixing velocity
of 100 s–1), and the produced foams are subsequently
highly stable at rest. Using scaling arguments, we find that the shear-induced
collapse of the foams is obtained below a critical ratio, NE/NB < 15, of
the number of entanglements per chain, NE, and the number of borax per chain, NB. For a mixing velocity of 20 s–1, the critical
ratio falls down to 7. Rheological measurements of the PVA/borax solutions
show that the solutions are shear thickening. The rate at which the
viscosity diverges with the shear rate increases when the PVA/borax
ratio decreases.

Combining the foam observations and the rheological
measurements,
we suggest that the foam collapse is due to the strong increase of
the viscosity during the mixing process, which induces a viscous to
fragile transition of the samples. Experiments consisting in a fast
stretching of PVA/borax catenoids show that the thin films undergo
a viscous to brittle transition below a critical PVA/borax ratio:
the films do not minimize their surface energy and become brittle
upon stretching. However, we note that the critical ratio for film
fracture is much higher than the one measured for the foam collapse,
of the order of 150: the thin films break at very low borax concentrations.
We suggest that this discrepancy between film and foam measurements
is due to the fact that in the film experiment, the thin film is larger
than the ones in the foam, increasing the probability of rupture.
Moreover, in the thin-film stretching experiment, the flow is purely
elongational, possibly leading to higher viscosities than in a shear
experiment. To summarize, we suggest that the shear-induced collapse
of the PVA/borax foams observed during the foaming process is due
to the rupture of the thin liquid films and subsequent coalescence
of the bubbles and is related to a transition from a viscous to a
fragile behavior, which depends on the PVA/borax ratio and shear rate.
