Nucleic acid analysis has become
highly relevant for point-of-care
(POC) diagnostics since the advent of isothermal amplification methods
that do not require thermal cycling. In particular, recombinase polymerase
amplification (RPA) combined with lateral flow detection offers a
rapid and simple solution for field-amenable low-resource nucleic
acid testing. Expanding POC nucleic acid tests for the detection of
multiple analytes is vital to improve diagnostic efficiency because
increased multiplexing capacity enables higher information density
combined with reduced assay time and costs. Here, we investigate expanding
RPA POC detection by identifying a generic multiplex RPA format that
can be combined with a generic multiplex lateral flow device (LFD)
to enable binary and molecular encoding for the compaction of diagnostic
data. This new technology relies on the incorporation of molecular
labels to differentiate nucleic acid species spatially on a lateral
flow membrane. In particular, we identified additional five molecular
labels that can be incorporated during the RPA reaction for subsequent
coupling with LFD detection. Combined with two previously demonstrated
successful labels, we demonstrate potential to enable hepta-plex detection
of RPA reactions coupled to multiplex LFD detection. When this hepta-plex
detection is combined with binary and molecular encoding, an intuitive
7-segment output display can be produced. We note that in all experiments,
we used an identical DNA template, except for the 5′ label
on the forward primer, to eliminate any effects of nucleic acid sequence
amplification bias. Our proof-of-concept technology demonstration
is highly relevant for developing information-compact POC diagnostics
where space and time are premium commodities.

1 Introduction
Nucleic
acid testing is a critical tool in diagnostics, particularly
for enhancing microbial detection using sensitive, specific, and rapid
methodologies.1 The advent of isothermal
nucleic acid amplification methods has enabled testing highly amenable
for point-of-care (POC) applications. In particular, recombinase polymerase
amplification (RPA) is considered as one of the most promising candidates
for POC applications, as it uses low incubation temperatures (37–42
°C), to detect as little as a single copy of nucleic acid, in
less than 10 min of reaction time.2 The
combination of RPA with lateral flow device (LFD) detection2a,2c,3 is highly amenable for POC diagnostics,
as LFDs are portable and provide easy-to-interpret analytical data.

One limitation of traditional LFDs for POC use is the restriction
to single-plex detection. Expanding to multiplex POC detection is
vital for (i) efficient infectious disease diagnosis, given the increasing
number of biomarkers discovered; (ii) reducing false positive or negative
reporting in cases where a single biomarker may be indicative of more
than one disease;4 and (iii) reducing diagnostic
time and costs compared to performing multiple single tests. Previously
reported multiplex LFDs operate by increasing the number of lines
or dots incorporated within one device, with each one representing
the detection of a specific analyte.5 Indeed,
this strategy was recently combined with RPA for the detection of
up to three bacterial parasites.6 However,
with any multiplex LFD, there is a physical limit to detection capacity
expansion because the flow rate decreases with distance from the conjugate
pad and interpretation becomes difficult as the number of lines or
dots accumulates.

To circumvent multiplex LFD expansion limitations,
we recently
reported a novel LFD technology that combines binary and molecular
encoding to increase multiplex detection capacity without expanding
device dimensions.7 The binary encoding
refers to the presence or absence of a sensor output (i.e., on/off
or 1/0),8 and the molecular encoding refers
to the use of multiple molecular labels, which when combined can provide
barcode-like identification.7 Additionally,
we combined this detection system into a compact 7-segment display
output that is highly amenable for intuitive interpretation by the
user without requiring external readers.7 Because our system uses standard molecular labels for generic sandwich
assay detection of biomarkers, it can be applied to nucleic acid testing
through the incorporation of molecular labels into primers and probes
during the amplification reaction. With RPA, the DNA labeling process
can be done without a predenaturation step and with a high efficiency
(104-fold) within 10 min.2a This
is because RPA employs an enzyme-derived primer binding process by
the recombinase and other auxiliary proteins rather than a physicochemical
hybridization of primers. For combining RPA with LFD detection, the
probe and one of the primers contain 5′ molecular labels to
produce dual-labeled amplicons that can be subsequently detected via
a sandwich assay (Figure 1a). Such a dual-labeling process using RPA is highly specific,
as the enzyme (Nfo) can only cleave the probe once it binds to the
complementary target sequence in the DNA template, and only dual-labeled
amplicons will produce a positive test signal (Figure 1b).

LFD detection, a dual-labeled RPA amplicon is sandwiched between capture
and detection antibodies via antigen–antibody binding. Capture
antibodies (mouse anti-fluorescein antibody) are conjugated to AuNPs,
which enables visualization of RPA amplicon binding through the appearance
of a red colored test dot. Rabbit anti-mouse antibody, which can directly
bind the capture antibody (mouse anti-fluorescein), is deposited in
parallel as a control. (c) Results of single-plex RPA coupled with

by *), negatives, and the cutoff (indicated by black dashed line).
Positive results compared to the number of individual runs and analytical

Previously, Crannell and colleagues
reported a failure of RPA amplification
with the use of primers with five different 5′ labels (Cy3,
Cy5, bromodeoxyuridine, tetrachlorofluorescein, and hexachlorofluorescein)
compared to successful use with three 5′ labels (Alexa Fluor488,
digoxigenin, and fluorescein).6 In this
study, we combine RPA with our compact multiplex LFD strategy and
demonstrate that primers containing up to seven different 5′
molecular labels can be successfully incorporated during a single-tube
RPA reaction (with a 5′-labeled probe). We verify single-plex
RPA reactions using these seven different molecular tags, followed
by both single-plex and multiplex LFD detection. We then demonstrate
that all seven molecular labels can be combined in a multiplex RPA
reaction coupled with multiplex LFD detection. Finally, we describe
the coupling of this multiplex RPA reaction with our compact multiplex
7-segment display LFD, indicating that the combination of RPA with
binary and molecular encoding can enable an intuitive LFD result display
highly amenable for POC operation.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Single-Plex RPA Combined
with Single-Plex
Lateral Flow Detection
In this study, we aimed to demonstrate
that RPA could be combined with multiplexed LFD detection via incorporation
of multiple 5′-labeled primers during the RPA reaction, followed
by sandwich assay LFD detection. We used RPA to combine a varying
5′ molecular label on the forward primer, with a 5′
FAM-labeled probe, to obtain dual-labeled double-stranded amplicons
(Figure 1a). The 5′-labeled
primer, reverse primer, and the 5′ FAM-labeled probe (TwistAmp
LF probe; the 3′ blocker prevents DNA extension) bind specifically
to complementary sequences in a DNA template. Once the probe binds,
the enzyme (Nfo) detects the abasic residue (dSpacer) in the probe.
Subsequently, Nfo chops off the remaining segment behind it, thereby
removing the 3′ blocker and simultaneously producing a 3′
hydroxide group (OH) that can be elongated. The DNA polymerase elongates
from 3′ ends of the primers and probe and replaces the downstream
sequences. After several rounds of reactions, dual-labeled double-stranded
amplicons are generated for subsequent LFD detection.2f LFD sandwich detection was achieved by depositing anti-label
detection antibodies in the test zone of the nitrocellulose membrane
and by using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) conjugated to an anti-FAM
capture antibody to transform the sandwich complex (capture antibody/AuNPs/nucleic
acid/detection antibody) into a colorimetric signal (Figure 1b). We chose to incorporate
the 5′ labels into the forward primer based on our previous
successful demonstration of multiplex LFD detection using synthetic
dual-labeled single-stranded DNA.7 The
analytical sensitivity and specificity of the multiplex LFD had previously
been reported in the absence of nucleic acid amplification;7 this study thus assessed the ability of the system
to be combined with a prior nucleic acid amplification step. We targeted
the Rift Valley fever virus S (RVFV S) gene as a proof-of-concept
DNA template for RPA amplification and LFD detection because it had
previously been demonstrated effective for real-time RPA detection.9 Importantly, we kept the RVFV S DNA analyte sequence
identical in all tests (apart from the incorporated 5′ forward
primer molecular labels) to eliminate any differences in behavior
because of subtle changes in nucleotide sequences.

We first
tested RPA incorporation of each 5′ molecular label in separate
RPA reactions, followed by single-plex LFD detection. Each RPA reaction
contained a different 5′-labeled forward primer [either biotin,
digoxigenin (NHS ester), TAMRA (NHS ester), Texas Red-X (NHS ester),
Cascade Blue C6-NH, DNP-X C6-NH, or Dansyl-X C6-NH]. Incorporation
of the labeled primer was demonstrated, as observed by the appearance
of a colored test dot when the DNA template was supplied into the
RPA reaction (Figure 1c). No background amplification was observed in the absence of a
DNA template, indicating that the reactions were DNA template-specific
(Figure 1c).

Next, we hypothesized that the varying 5′ molecular labels
may affect the analytical sensitivity [also known as limit of detection
(LOD)] of the RPA-LFD assay. To address this hypothesis, we measured
the LOD for all seven 5′ molecular labels using 10-fold serial
dilutions of the RFVF S gene target DNA and performed digital analysis
(Figure 1d, digoxigenin; Figure S1, Dansyl, DNP, TAMRA, Cascade Blue,
Texas Red, biotin). Incorporating digoxigenin, Dansyl, and TAMRA as
5′ molecular labels resulted in a LOD of 51 synthetic gene
copies per reaction, whereas biotin showed a LOD of 511 synthetic
gene copies per reaction. LOD for these four labels is similar to
previously reported LOD using digoxigenin, Alexa-Fluor 488, fluorescein,6 and biotin.10 Notably,
LODs from primers labeled with Cascade Blue (5.11 × 102 copies/μL), DNP (5.11 × 103 copies/μL),
and Texas Red (5.11 × 104 copies/μL) were 10–1000×
higher, suggesting that LODs for different 5′ molecular labels
significantly vary. It is likely that the detection antibodies have
a significant impact on the LOD, suggesting that further optimization
is required to diminish the impact of different antigen (5′
molecular labels) and detection antibody combinations within an assay.

This is the first report of successful RPA incorporation of primers
containing TAMRA, Texas Red, Cascade Blue, DNP, and Dansyl (biotin
and digoxigenin have previously been described6), with TAMRA and Dansyl demonstrating particularly high LODs when
coupled with LFD. The successful incorporation of seven labels during
RPA-LFD detection suggests that RPA generally tolerates 5′
label incorporation, despite a previous report that five different
5′ labels (Cy5, Cy3, bromodeoxyuridine, tetrachlorofluorescein,
and hexachlorofluorescein)6 were not successfully
detected using a RPA-LFD detection. We previously demonstrated, using
dual-labeled single-stranded DNA, that Cy5 is not well tolerated for
LFD detection because of low sensitivity7 and thus similarly excluded it from our present study. Additionally,
while a different 5′ molecular label, Alexa-Fluor 488, has
been shown to be successfully incorporated during RPA-LFD,6 we previously demonstrated that the Alexa-488
molecular label cross-reacts with an anti-Texas Red antibody,7 so we also excluded this 5′ molecular
label from the present study.

2.2 Specificity
Test of the Seven Dual-Labeled
RPA Amplicons on a Multiplexed Lateral Flow Detection
In
order to achieve multiplexed lateral flow detection using these RPA
dual-labeled DNAs, we performed a specificity test by running each
dual-labeled RPA amplicon on a LFD that was predeposited with all
seven corresponding antibodies. The results showed that all the seven
RPA dual-labeled amplicons only produced a colored test dot at the
position corresponding to the antibody specific to their 5′
forward primer molecular label (Figure 2a,b), indicating specific detection in each case. This
is consistent with our previous report that single-stranded dual-labeled
DNA containing these same labels was specific only to their corresponding
antibodies.7

on multiplexed LFDs. (a) Positioning of detection antibodies deposited

with 5′ FAM and 3′ X, X = biotin, digoxigenin (NHS ester),
TAMRA (NHS ester), Texas Red-X (NHS ester), Cascade Blue C6-NH, DNP-X
C6-NH, or Dansyl-X C6-NH) were detected individually on multiplexed
LFDs. The assay was repeated twice, and a representative photograph
is shown.

2.3 Seven
Single-Plex RPA Reactions Combined with
Multiplexed Lateral Flow Detection
Because all the seven
RPA dual-labeled amplicons were specific only to their corresponding
anti-label antibodies, we combined these amplicons as a mixture (with
running buffer) and confirmed the capacity of the multiplex LFD to
display all seven test dots in a single assay. Results indicated that
all the seven RPA dual-labeled amplicons can be detected simultaneously
on a single LFD (Figure 3a, right). However, we found that extra volumes of 5′ FAM/5′
biotin and 5′ FAM/5′ Dansyl-X C6–NH (3.0 μL
instead of 2.0 μL for the other RPA dual-labeled amplicons)
in the sample mixture were required to achieve approximately equal
test dot intensities for all seven antigen–antibody detections
with multiplexed LFD detection (Figure S2b,c). It is likely that the binding affinities of biotin to anti-biotin
and Dansyl-X C6-NH to anti-dansyl were weaker in comparison to the
other antigen–antibody combinations, as suggested by the intensity
of the test dot during the single-plex LFD detection results (Figure 1c).

2.0 μL of 5′ FAM/3′ X, X = digoxigenin (NHS ester),
TAMRA (NHS ester), Texas Red-X (NHS ester), Cascade Blue C6-NH, or
DNP-X C6-NH) mixture was detected on the multiplexed LFD (right).

TAMRA (NHS ester), Texas Red-X (NHS ester), Cascade Blue C6-NH, or
DNP-X C6-NH) for defined number displays. (e) Resulting successful
appearance of numbers (0–9). The assay was performed three
times with similar results; a photograph of one test is shown.

Next, we combined the RPA dual-labeled
amplicons as mixtures to
display numbers on our previously described 7-segment display LFDs.7 Numbers 0–9 were clearly visible when
the defined RPA dual-labeled amplicon mixture was applied (Figure 3e). Alphanumeric
solution-phase displays detecting synthetic oligonucleotides have
previously been reported as proof-of-concept demonstrations for identifying
filoviruses8 and lyssaviruses11 and also Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug susceptibility.12 Here, we demonstrate
that a solid-phase alphanumerical display can be linked to a simple
isothermal amplification method, indicating potential for the amplification
of pathogen nucleic acid signatures to improve detection on such displays,
in a more portable format suitable for use in low-resource situations.
Interestingly, the number display represents an unbiased test of different
label combinations toward a specific end goal (the display of a numeral).
Our seven different labels have the potential to be uniquely combined
to produce 127 (27 – 1) different display patterns
using defined combination of RPA dual-labeled amplicons. However,
testing each combination would be an exhaustive and costly exercise.
By applying these combinations to produce a 7-segment display, we
sample and demonstrate success for a smaller test set of ten different
combinations. Such sampling testing strategies are common in systems
with complex decision trees such as integrated circuits,13 and formal sampling strategies will need to
be adopted for LFD detection as system complexity increases.

Multiple parallel RPA reactions coupled with multiplexed detection
have been demonstrated previously on a solid phase in a microarray
format.14 The highest previous multiplexing
was sixteen parallel RPA reactions (as four analytes in quadruplex
replicates) on a single solid phase, followed by detection using specific
equipment (e.g., microarray scanner). In comparison to these, our
research demonstrates the potential for hepta-plex detection using
an amplicon mixture that contained up to seven different parallel
RPA reactions on a self-operated device with direct result interpretation
by the end user. Notably, although we used the same DNA template for
all the parallel RPA reactions, our detection technology is generic
or DNA template independent, which means that it can be applied for
amplifying seven different DNA templates. Importantly, using the same
DNA template for all RPA reactions, followed by multiplex LFD, combined
with our previous study on antigen−antibody affinities for
the same template,7 allowed us to investigate
the impact of hybridization rates of chosen antigen–antibody
pairs, which critically influence the multiplex LOD. Our results indicate
that future multiplex assay design for seven different DNA templates
must take not only variances in primer RPA incorporation into account
but also hybridization rates during incorporation into multiplex LFD.

2.4 Multiplex RPA Reactions Combined with Multiplexed
Lateral Flow Detection
Successful operation of the single-plex
RPA combined with multiplex LFD encouraged us to trial multiplex RPA
detection by combining forward primers labeled with different tags
in a single tube (with reverse primer, probe, and other RPA reagents)
(Figure 4a–c).
This multiplexing RPA is notably different from that of Crannell and
colleagues,6 who performed triplex detection
of bacterial parasites using three different DNA templates. In our
proof-of-concept multiplex RPA demonstration, we continued to use
an identical DNA template while adding different combinations of labeled
primers. This allowed us to eliminate any binding bias toward the
DNA template among the labeled primers during the RPA reaction to
fully determine the specific competitive effect of the labels themselves
and assess the impact of hybridization rates of chosen antigen–antibody
pairs. Results (Figure 4D) indicated that we could successfully perform multiplex RPA, followed
by multiplex LFD detection, demonstrating a complete 7-segment display.

RPA forward primer signature mixtures (5′ labeled with biotin,

Cascade Blue C6-NH, DNP-X C6-NH, or Dansyl-X C6-NH) with reverse primer,
probe, and other RPA reagents in one reaction tube for defined number
displays. (d) Resulting successful appearance of numbers (0−9)
on the LFDs. The assay was performed three times with similar results;
a photograph of one test is shown.

Multiplexing RPA has been demonstrated previously,2a,6,15 with only a few examples further
combining it with POC-suitable LFD detection.2a,6,10,15g−15i Piepenburg and colleagues were leading the field with the detection
of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus genotype I to III on single-plex strips.2a Several years later, the first successful triplex RPA reaction in
combination with LFD detection has been demonstrated by Crannell and
colleagues distinguishing three different bacterial parasite DNA templates.
Since then, three more duplex RPA reactions with LFD detection were
established to simultaneously detect Salmonella enteritidis and Listeria monocytogenes,15g carp edema virus and koi herpes virus,15i and Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila.10 Our multiplexing RPA system incorporated seven
labeled forward primers to amplify a RVFV S gene DNA template in a
single tube and thus has the potential to produce the highest multiplexing
of RPA to date. In addition, our multiplex LFD effectively detects
multiplex RPA reactions in 10 synchronous LFD reactions (as there
are 10 dots that make the 7-segment display), providing exceptional
confidence and robustness in result interpretation. In addition, by
applying molecular and binary encoding to manipulate the inputs of
different primer combinations in the RPA reaction (a form of barcoding),
our multiplexed LFD could theoretically detect 127 (27 –
1) discrete analytes. We do acknowledge, however, that RPA detection
of multiple DNA templates would require judicial bioinformatics selection
and experimental testing of primer and probe combinations because
interactions between primers, probe, and multiple DNA targets could
lead to nonspecific amplification products. Additionally, variation
in amplification efficiency must be considered when different DNA
templates are amplified with their corresponding primers and probe.
The optimization of primers and probe ratios will be crucial to design
a highly sensitive multiplex RPA-LFD. Further, special care must be
taken to identify a suitable high-affinity antibody to detect the
dual-labeled amplicons. We note that the antibody deposition (of the
test dots) in our research was performed by hand pipetting, and thus,
the quality of the test dots was not smooth and evenly distributed,
which led to the appearance of comet tails for some of the test dots.
To reduce these artifacts, we applied ethanol precipitation prior
to applying amplicons to the LFD (although RPA amplicons can be directly
applied to LFD), which removes proteins and crowding agents that affect
wicking performance and alleviate “ghost band” effects.2f Although these issues limit portability and
usability, they can be solved by the application of advanced deposition
techniques, such as inkjet printing.16 Inkjet
printing sprays anti-label antibodies in a series of microdots rather
than depositing a single large drop by hand (e.g., the Symbolics technology17a−17c), so that the anti-label antibodies distribute evenly in an optimized
manner on the matrix. In this case, the microdots prevent perturbation
of the flow of liquid and conjugate as it traverses the device, enabling
clarity of text and improving performance and portability (after judicious
optimization of parameters such as reagent concentration, reagent
on-rates, drop size, drop spacing, surface tension, and viscosity16).

The successful results also demonstrated
that the forward primers
labeled with different tags (except for the biotin tag) showed approximately
equal incorporation efficiencies into the DNA template (Figure 4d). However, we note that a
double concentration of the 5′ biotin-labeled forward primer
was required in comparison to the other labeled forward primers in
order to form dual-labeled amplicons that could be visualized on the
multiplexed lateral flow detection. Any further increases in the concentration
of the 5′ biotin-labeled primer interfered with the binding
efficiency of the 5′ Dansyl-X C6-NH-labeled primer to the DNA
template and reduced test dot intensity of Dansyl label pair on the
multiplex display of number 8 (Figure S3b). In addition, the position of the antibodies itself on the multiplex
strip impacts the test dot intensity when detecting differently labeled
RPA amplicons. Note that antigen (5′ molecular label) and detection
antibody combinations with higher LOD (Figures 2c and S1) were
placed closer to the conjugate/sample pads to enhance the AuNP conjugate/capture
antibody efficiency. We ensured that the multiplex RPA assay can detect
the RFVF S gene target DNA at predetermined concentrations by performing
digital analysis (Figure S4b).

General
multiplex nucleic acid amplification coupled with multiplexed
LFD detection has been demonstrated previously; however, the majority
employ the nonisothermal amplification method − polymerase
chain reaction (PCR);5a−5c,5i,18 only a few employ the isothermal amplification methods [e.g., RPA6,10,15g,15i and loop-medicated isothermal amplification (LAMP).19 The highest multiplexing in these systems was hepta-plex
detection of six human papillomavirus and a human β-globin gene
using PCR amplicons.5i However, a post-probe
hybridization was required for the subsequent LFD detection, and a
fluorescent reader is required for signal measurement.5i Our detection technology employs RPA and shows
feasibility of DNA labeling using 5′-labeled primers and probe,
which is much faster (35 min in comparison to 1 h PCR) and negates
the need for a 30 min probe hybridization before the LFD detection.
Also, our signals are colorimetric (not fluorescent) and can be inspected
by eye without external readers. Moreover, in comparison to PCR and
LAMP, using RPA to combine with LFD for POC diagnostics has several
advantages: (1) no requirement to predenature the DNA template (LAMP
can be performed with the nondenatured DNA template; however, the
reaction efficiency decreases and reaction time increases20); (2) low reaction temperature (PCR requires
rising temperature to 95 °C; LAMP performs between 60 and 65
°C); (3) highest amplification efficiency (104-fold
in 10 min;2a PCR amplifies to 109-fold in about 2 h; LAMP achieves 109-fold amplification
in approximately 1 h21); (4) commercially
available lyophilized reaction pellets22 with a shelf-life of several months stored at −20 °C
(can tolerate room temperature for days without loss of activity)
and (5) commercially available portable devices for field use.

3 Conclusions
We have developed a potentially field-deployable
nucleic acid assay
by combining an RPA reaction with multiplexed lateral flow detection.
Our research demonstrated potential for the highest multiplexing of
an RPA reaction (hepta-plexing) to date. In addition, we demonstrated
the first intuitive LFD result display to be coupled with any nucleic
acid amplification reactions. Our results showed successful incorporation
of seven 5′-labeled primers (containing either biotin, digoxigenin
(NHS ester), TAMRA (NHS ester), Texas Red-X (NHS ester), Cascade Blue
C6-NH, DNP-X C6-NH, or Dansyl-X C6-NH, together with a 5′ FAM-labeled
probe) to the DNA template during RPA, followed by LFD detection.
In particular, the tags TAMRA (NHS ester), Texas Red-X (NHS ester),
Cascade Blue C6-NH, DNP-X C6-NH, and Dansyl-X C6-NH have not been
used in RPA DNA labeling before. The combination of RPA with lateral
flow detection can be performed in less than an hour, which allowed
a low quantity of DNA to be amplified and labeled and produced a visual
signal on the LFD based on a sandwich assay. Our intuitive result
display is highly relevant for POC applications because it provides
easy result interpretation compared to detecting multiple lines or
dots and does not require special equipment for signal visualization.

4.2.1 Single-Plex RPA Amplification
The
RPA reaction was conducted at 39 °C for 35 min using the TwistAmp
nfo kit (TwistDx Ltd., UK). Primers (420 nM), probe (120 nM), rehydration
buffer (29.5 μL), magnesium acetate (14 mM), and DNA template
(2.5 μL, 0.5 nM) were combined in a 50 μL reaction volume.
All the reagents, except for the DNA template and magnesium acetate,
were prepared in a master mix, which was used to rehydrate the lyophilized
reaction pellets. The DNA template was added to the resulting mixture,
and magnesium acetate was pipetted into the cap of each tube and centrifuged
down to initiate amplification. Subsequent RPA amplicons were purified
by the addition of 100% ice-cold ethanol and incubation for 20 min
on ice before centrifugation of precipitated nucleic acids (13 500g, 8 min), followed by a 70% ice-cold ethanol wash and recentrifugation
(13 500g, 8 min). Pellets were resuspended
in TE buffer (Tris 10 mM, EDTA 0.1 mM, pH 8.0) to the original RPA
volume of 50 μL.

4.2.2 Multiplex RPA Amplification
The
RPA reaction was conducted at 39 °C for 35 min using the TwistAmp
nfo kit (TwistDx Ltd., UK). For numerical displays (Table 1), the 50 μL reaction
volume contained either (i) for numbers “0”, “2”,
“3”, “5”, “6”, “9”,
and “8”: each forward primer (140 nM; except for biotin
at 280 nM), reverse primer (840 nM), probe (240 nM), rehydration buffer
(29.5 μL), magnesium acetate (14 mM), and DNA template (2.5
μL, 0.5 nM) or (ii) for numbers “1”, “4”,
and “7”: each forward primer (140 nM; except for biotin
280 nM), reverse primer (420 nM), probe (120 nM), rehydration buffer
(29.5 μL), magnesium acetate (14 mM), and DNA template (2.5 μL,
0.5 nM). Amplicons were again purified by ethanol precipitation as
described for the single-plex reactions.

4.2.3 Analytical
Sensitivity of RPA Amplification
The above-described RVFV
S DNA template was quantitated using the
Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Mulgrave, VIC,
Australia). To evaluate the sensitivity of the RPA amplification assay,
10-fold serial dilutions of the RVFV S template DNA in nuclease free
water were tested. The RPA reaction was conducted as described above
at 39 °C for 35 min using the TwistAmp nfo kit (TwistDx Ltd.,
UK).

4.3 Preparation of AuNP Conjugates
Anti-fluorescein
antibody was coupled to AuNPs, which served as the signaling molecule
(red in color) to allow the visualization of the immuno-sandwich complex
by eye observation. Coupling to AuNPs (40 nm, 20 OD/vial, which is
equivalent to 9 × 1010 particles per vial in 50 μL)
was performed using the InnovaCoat GOLD 10× Multi Explorer labelling
kit (BioNovus Life Sciences, Cherrybrook, NSW, Australia). Briefly,
reagents were thawed to 25 °C, and 12 μL of antibody (diluted
to 0.1 mg/mL using the diluent provided) was mixed with 42 μL
of reaction buffer. The mixture (45 μL) was used to resuspend
a vial of InnovaCoat GOLD nanoparticles, which was incubated for 10
min before the addition of 5 μL quencher, resulting in a final
20 OD solution (50 μL) of anti-fluorescein/AuNP. The conjugates
were washed twice with the borate running buffer (100 mM H3BO3, 100 mM Na2B4O7,
1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.8) by centrifuging at
14 500g for 6 min before resuspension to the
original (50 μL) volume. Scaled-up preparations to obtain 500
μL AuNP conjugates were achieved using the InnovaCoat GOLD Midi
kit (BioNovus Life Sciences, Cherrybrook, NSW, Australia). Conjugates
were stored at 4 °C.

4.4 Preparation of Single-Plex
Lateral Flow and
Multiplex Lateral Flow Devices
Conjugate and sample pads
(Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) were blocked with blocking solution
(1% polyvinyl alcohol, 20 mM Tris base, pH 7.4) for 30 min and dried
at room temperature for 2 h. The two pads were soaked in borate running
buffer for 30 min before drying at 25 °C for 6 h.

Assembled
devices (6.1 cm × 0.3 cm) for single-plex LFDs comprised treated
sample pad (1.5 cm), treated conjugate pad (0.6 cm), a nitrocellulose
membrane (2.5 cm; Hi-Flow Plus HF135), and an absorbent pad (1.5 cm)
(Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) all combined on an adhesive backing
card (KENOSHA c.v., Schweitzerlaan, Amstelveen, Netherlands), with
a 0.1 cm overlap between components. The multiplex LFDs (7.1 cm ×
0.5 cm) were assembled using the same components and procedure using
the treated sample pad (0.5 cm), treated conjugate pad (0.6 cm), a
nitrocellulose membrane (3.5 cm), and an absorbent pad (2.5 cm).

For single-plex LFD detection, antibodies [either anti-biotin (1.0
mg/mL), anti-digoxigenin (0.75 U/μL), anti-TAMRA (1.0 mg/mL),
anti-Texas Red (1.0 mg/mL), anti-Alexa Fluor 405/Cascade Blue (3.0
mg/mL), anti-Dinitrophenyl-KLH (2.0 mg/mL), or anti-Dansyl (1.0 mg/mL)]
were pipetted (0.4 μL) onto the test zone of the nitrocellulose
membrane. Rabbit anti-mouse antibody (1 mg/mL in 50% glycerol) was
pipetted (0.4 μL) at the control zone. Test and control antibodies
were spotted 0.5 cm apart and dried at 25 °C for 45 min. For
multiplex LFD detection, each detection antibody (0.2 μL) was
deposited and, as a control, rabbit anti-mouse antibody was pipetted
(0.2 μL) in triplicate at the end of each array.

4.5 Single-Plex Lateral Flow and Multiplex Lateral
Flow Device Test Procedures
Single-plex LFD detection was
performed as described previously23 but
used purified RPA amplicons, except for analytical sensitivity assays
which used nonpurified RPA amplicons. Briefly, anti-fluorescein/AuNP
conjugate (1 μL) was pipetted onto the conjugate pad, and the
LFD was dipped into a mixture containing 100 μL of running buffer
and 5 μL of RPA amplicon. An additional 1 μL of anti-fluorescein/AuNP
conjugate was pipetted onto the conjugate pad once the borate running
buffer reached the bottom of the absorbent pad as this double-run
method has been demonstrated to be effective for developing high signal
intensity with reduced anti-fluorescein/AuNP consumption.23 The LFD was developed for 15 min. All experiments
were repeated at least three times to demonstrate the consistency
of results.

For the single-plex RPA combined with multiplex
LFD detection, purified RPA amplicons (2.0 μL, 5′ FAM/5′
X, X = digoxigenin (NHS Ester), TAMRA (NHS ester), Texas Red-X (NHS
ester), Cascade Blue C6-NH, or DNP-X C6-NH) and/or purified RPA amplicons
(3.0 μL, 5′ FAM/5′ X, X = biotin or Dansyl-X C6-NH)
were mixed with 220 μL of running buffer. Briefly, anti-fluorescein/AuNP
conjugate (2.5 μL) was pipetted onto the conjugate pad, and
the LFD was dipped into the RPA amplicon and running buffer mixture.
An additional 2.5 μL of anti-fluorescein/AuNP conjugate was
pipetted onto the conjugate pad once the running buffer reached the
bottom of the absorbent pad. The LFD was developed for 25 min. All
experiments were repeated at least twice to demonstrate the consistency
of results.

For the multiplex RPA in combination with multiplex
lateral flow
detection, anti-fluorescein/AuNP conjugate (2.5 μL) was pipetted
onto the conjugate pad, and the LFD was dipped into a mixture containing
220 μL of running buffer and 5 μL of purified RPA amplicon
(corresponding to display numbers 0–9). An additional 2.5 μL
of anti-fluorescein/AuNP conjugate was pipetted onto the conjugate
pad once the running buffer reached the bottom of the absorbent pad.
The LFD was developed for 25 min. All experiments were repeated at
least twice to demonstrate the consistency of results.

4.6 Image and Statistical Data Analysis
Reacted LFDs were
dried, imaged using the MultiDoc-ItTM Digital Imaging
System (Upland, CA, USA), and analyzed using ImageJ software (National
Institutes of Health, MD, USA). Image brightness/contrast and color
balance were autoadjusted. To determine the analytical sensitivity,
grayscale-converted images were used to determine dot intensity by
measuring the mean gray value (limit to threshold), using a fixed
area measurement, and subtracting from the maximum mean gray value
(255). For each test dot, the average of two neighboring relative
white spaces was subtracted from the band intensity to normalize the
results. A sample was defined as positive if the normalized band intensity
was 3 times higher than the standard deviation of the two neighboring
white space values.
