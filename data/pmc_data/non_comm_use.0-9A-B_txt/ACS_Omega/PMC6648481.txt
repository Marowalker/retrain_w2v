The initial reaction mechanism of
energetic materials under impact
loading and the role of crystal properties in impact initiation and
sensitivity are still unclear. In this paper, we report reactive molecular
dynamics simulations of shock initiation of 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine
(RDX) crystals containing a cube void. Shock-induced void collapse,
hot spots formation and growth, as well as spalling are revealed to
be dependent on the shock velocity. The void collapse times are 1.5
and 0.7 ps, for the shock velocity of 2 and 4 km·s–1, respectively. Results indicate that the initial hot spot formation
consists of two steps: one is the temperature rise caused by local
plastic deformation and the other is the temperature increase resulting
from the collision of upstream and downstream particles during the
void collapse. Whether hot spots will continue to grow or quench depends
on sensitive balance between energy release caused by local physical
and chemical reactions and various heat dissipation mechanisms. In
our simulations, hot spot would grow for Up = 4 km·s–1; hot spot is weak to some extent
for Up = 2 km·s–1. The tensile wave reflected by the shock wave after reaching the
free surface causes the spalling, which depends on the initial shock
velocity. Typical spalling occurs for the shock velocity 2 km·s–1, while the tensile wave induces the microsplit region
in RDX crystals in the case of Up = 4
km·s–1. Chemical reactions are studied for
Rankine–Hugoniot shock pressures Ps = 14.4, 57.8 GPa. For the weak shock, there is almost no decomposition
reaction of the RDX molecules near the spalling region. On the contrary,
there are large number of small molecule products, such as H2O, CO2, NO2, and so forth, around the microsplit
regions for the strong shock. The ruptures of N–NO2 bond are the main initial reaction mechanisms for the shocked RDX
crystal and are not affected by shock strength, while the microsplit
slows down the decomposition rate of RDX. The work in this paper can
shed light on a thorough understanding of thermal ignition, hot spot
growth, and other physical and chemical phenomena of energetic materials
containing voids under impact loading.

1 Introduction
Condensed
phase energetic materials usually contain defects (such
as crystal dislocations, shear bands, defects, voids, etc.), making
the energetic material heterogeneous, which is beneficial for hot
spots formation and detonation under impact loading.1−5 Hot spots are localized regions of high temperature and high pressure
in materials that serve as nucleation sites for initiating and possibly
sustaining rapid chemistry. Various mechanisms have been provided
to explain the formation mechanism of “hot spots”: void
collapse, adiabatic shear bands, fraction, and heating at dislocation
pileups.6−9 Because of the complex physical and chemical coupling effects and
the elastoplastic deformation of the energetic material, as well as
very short time scale and space scale, the current experimental techniques
are difficult to reveal the detailed process of the shock initiation
of energetic materials from an atomic and molecular level, while the
molecular dynamics (MD) simulation method can be used to reveal the
formation process of hot spots and the progress of chemical reactions
from the microscopic scale; the latter also provides a new way to
analyze the physical and chemical processes of energetic materials
under shock loading.

The work of Holian et al.10 showed that
the reason for the formation of hot spots is the evaporation of materials
into the pores and subsequent recompression in the process of pore
collapse in Lennard-Jones system. Hatano11 used 3-D Lennard-Jones system simulations containing cuboid voids
of varying size and found that increasing cross-sectional area perpendicular
to the shock direction increases the number of energetic intermolecular
collisions, whereas the increase of the gap length parallel to the
impact direction increases the peak temperature resulting from void
collapse. MD simulations have also been used to investigate cubane
nitrogen with square pore collapse that produces jetting.12 Herring et al.13 studied
the effect of the arrangement of circular pores with various sizes
on the formation process of impact-induced hot spots and found that
the wide pressure wave generated by the hot spots seems to be the
main mechanism of the detonation transition. Shan and Thompson.14,15 simulated the hot spots formation and growth in shocked pentaerythritol
tetranitrate (PETN) crystals. They found an asymmetrical evolution
of hot spots growth and secondary circular shockwave, formed upon
void collapse. Long and Chen.16 simulated
the void collapse and hot spots formation in shocked polymer-bonded
explosives (PBXs) as well. The results indicated out that the hot
spots formation should undergo three processes, namely void collapse,
heat transformation, and temperature relaxation. Zhou et al.17 focused on the hot spots formation of octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine
(HMX) crystals with various spherical voids size and impact strengths.
They found out that increasing void size leads to a slower shock wave
velocity and a more curved shock wave front. Jaramillo et al.18 characterized the atomic-level mechanisms of
plastic deformation in HMX crystal under dynamical loading. The results
showed that the deformation of the HMX crystal passes through the
elastic deformation, the plastic deformation, and the nanoscale shear
band formation, and these deformations are strongly dependent on the
impact strength. An et al.19,20 reported on the shock-induced
behavior of PBX based on the silapentaerythritol tetranitrate, 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine
(RDX). They found hot spots also occur when a plane shock wave propagates
to the heterogeneous cross section of a polymer explosive due to the
difference in density of the two materials in the polymer. Eason and
Sewell.21 considered that strong shock
produces a fluid-like jet structure during collapse in the RDX crystals.
Strachan et al.22 studied shock propagation
via nonequilibrium MD simulations at various collision velocities
and found that local overheating caused by impact promotes chemical
reaction. Nomura et al.23 reported million
atoms reactive force field MD simulation of shock initiation of RDX
crystal with a nanometer-scale void. They indicate that the nanojet
formed during void collapse is related to the free volume of the void
to enhance the intermolecular collision.

Although quite a few
researches have been done by using MDs simulation
methods for the initial reaction mechanism of energetic materials
under impact loading, the role of crystal properties in impact initiation
and sensitivity remains to be understood. In this paper, the void
collapse process of RDX with a cube void under various shock velocities
is simulated by MDs method with the reactive force field (ReaxFF)/lg24 force field. The formation of hot spots and
shock-induced spallation during the interaction between shock wave
and cube void are to be studied in order to explain the detonation
mechanism of energetic materials from an atomic level. The work should
give insight for thermal ignition and hot spots growth of energetic
materials.

2 Simulation Details
2.1 Details
of ReaxFF
The first principles
based ReaxFF reaction force field can be used to the formation and
breakage of chemical bonds in energetic materials under extreme conditions
by using the relationship among bond length, bond order and bond energy,
and the dynamic transfer of charges above atoms.25 The ReaxFF is a bond-order potential based from quantum
mechanical (QM) calculations, which provides accurate descriptions
of complex chemical reactive processes (see bond-order cutoff in Supporting Information Table S1). As an extension,
the ReaxFF/lg24 added a long-range correction
term using a low-gradient model Elg based on ReaxFF (see more details
about ReaxFF/ g in Supporting Information S2). The simulation results of the crystal structure and state equation
of energetic materials using ReaxFF/lg potential are in good agreement
with experimental results.17,26−28

2.2 Details of MD Simulation
The initial
RDX crystal unit cell contains 8 molecules.29 In order to obtain calculation accuracy and study the microscopic
response of local shock wave propagating in RDX materials,30 a supercell containing 400 unit cells was built
by extending the initial RDX unit cell in the x, y, and z directions (40 × 10 ×
1). The dimensions in the x, y,
and z directions are 530.235, 115.740, and 10.709
Å respectively, and the initial density is around 1.80 g·cm–3. The unit cell contains a cube void with a size of
60 × 60 × 10.709 Å3 to study the shock-induced
hot spots formation of RDX crystals as shown in Figure 1. A nonperiodic boundary condition is applied
in the x direction, while the periodic boundary conditions
are applied in the y and z directions.
The structure of the supercell is first optimized by energy minimization,
and then the relaxation process is carried out at 300 K using the NVT ensemble for 2 ps. The particles in the system are driving
against the reflection wall at the y–z plane at velocities of 2 and 4 km·s–1 in the negative x direction to generate a shock
wave propagating along the x-direction. Reflection
wall is applied to the left boundary of the system, which means that
if an atom moves outside the wall on a timestep by a distance delta,
then it is wrapped back inside the other face by the same delta, and
the sign of the corresponding component of its velocity is flipped.31 The shock simulations were performed using ReaxFF/lg
potential in large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator31,32 with a 0.1 fs time step under the NVE ensemble.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Void Collapse and Hot Spot
Formation
Figure 2 shows the
spatial–temporal temperature distribution in process of void
collapse for the case of Up = 2 km·s–1 (a,c,e) and Up = 4 km·s–1 (b,d,f). The temperature in each simulation is calculated
after subtracting the center-of-mass (COM) velocity of all the atoms
using the previous method.18,33 More details about
the method are shown in the Supporting Information S3. Once the shock wave propagates to the upstream surface
of the void, the molecules on the upstream surface begin to enter
the void, causing local plastic deformation. Figure 2a,b shows the temperature distributions when
the shock wave reaches the upstream surface of the void under the
impact velocity of 2 and 4 km·s–1. The temperature
rise at this time is mainly caused by shock compression and local
plastic deformation. Comparing Figure 2e,f, it can be seen that at low impact velocity (2
km·s–1), the upstream free surface starts to
collide with the downstream interface at around 3.5 ps, until the
void is closed at around 5.0 ps; at high impact velocity (4 km·s–1), the void is fully closed at around 3.2 ps, with
the corresponding void collapse time of 1.5 and 0.7 ps, respectively.
It also shows that the time intensity of void collapse depends on
the velocity of collision. The shock wave velocity Us averaged before the void collapse is calculated to be
4.0, 8.5 km·s–1 for the case of Up = 2 km·s–1, Up = 4 km·s–1, respectively.

Figure 2 Spatial–temporal
temperature distribution in the process
of the void collapse for the case of Up = 2 km·s–1 (a,c,e) and Up = 4 km·s–1 (b,d,f). White regions
stand for the void.

In the process of void
collapse, the upstream and downstream particles
collide continuously inside the void, chemical reactions occur, and
heat is released. The internal temperature of the void is higher than
2500 K, and the hot spot where the shape remains radially symmetrical
is formed at the end of void collapse. The initial hot spot formation
mainly consists of two stages: the temperature rise caused by local
plastic deformation and the temperature increase resulting from the
collision of upstream and downstream particles during the void collapse.
For Up = 2 km·s–1, the maximum temperature of the hot spot region during the void
collapse at t = 5.0 ps is 3300 K, while the peak
temperature of the hot spot region after the void closure is above
6000 K at the case of Up = 4 km·s–1. The upstream and downstream particles collide with
each other to induce chemical reactions, heat release, as well as
secondary compression waves generated by upstream particles colliding
with downstream surfaces, resulting in temperatures up to 8000 K at
individual locations in void, as shown in Figure 2f.

As the void collapse process ends,
the shock wave propagates forward
in the form of convex plane wave at both collision velocities, which
is different from the concave plane wave formed by spherical void
collapse.17Figure 3 shows the averaged atom velocities Vx, Vy during the void collapse for the case of the Up = 4 km·s–1. As shown
in the figure, the points A and B, C and D used to observe the convex
shock wave are located at the upper and lower ends on the left side
of the void, the right side of the void, respectively. As the shock
wave arrives at the left side of void, the velocities in the x and y directions of point A is 2.19 and
1.77 km·s–1, respectively, as shown in Figure 3a,d. According to
the theorem for composition of velocities, the direction of resultant
velocity of point A is with the angle of approximately 39° to
the x positive direction, while the resultant velocity
of point B is at about −55° to the x positive
direction. It can be seen that the shock wave propagates in a convex
plane. The hydrodynamic fluid jets21,23 were not observed
in the process of the void collapse for the two reasons: void size
was too small and the particle velocity along the x direction was always greater than the particle velocity along the y direction.

Figure 3 Averaged atom velocities Vx, Vy in the process
of the void collapse for the case of Up = 4 km·s–1. Panels (a–c) represent
the velocity along the x direction; (d–f)
represent the velocity along the y direction.

3.2 Hot Spot
Growth
Nucleation and growth
of hot spots formed after void collapse is an important process to
induce chemical reactions in the system.15,16 It can be seen from Figure 2e,f that the various shock velocities lead to the different
sizes and temperature of the hot spot when the voids are closed. Therefore,
it is necessary to study the growth process of hot spots after void
collapse. Figure 4 presents
color maps of temperature for both shock velocities at three times
of interest: initial void collapse (a,b), at the time of maximum compression
(c,d), and the time when spalling occurs (e,f). As can be seen from Figure 4a,b, the size of
the hot spot increases after the void collapse, while the temperature
in the hot spot region drops a little, which it is still higher than
2000 K. Once the system reaches the maximum compression, the temperature
in the central region of the hot spot decreases slightly because of
the heat released by the chemical reaction in the collision of molecules
in the void. At this time, the size of the hot spot still grows. The
shape of hot spot is close to hemispherical and remains radially symmetrical
for the case of Up = 4 km·s–1, as shown in Figure 4d. When the shock wave arrives the free surface of the right end,
it emits a reverse stretching wave and interacts with the shock wave
along the x direction in the crystal, which makes
the hot spot grow. When spalling occurs, the growth of hot spots slows
down and the temperature gradually decreases for Up = 2 km·s–1. The wavefront temperature
is about 1500 K, as shown in Figure 4e; however, the hot spots growth is not observed. The
strong interaction between the shock wave and the stretching wave
results in more kinetic transformation into heat in the shock region,
and the shape of the hot spot changes to asymmetry at t = 9.0 ps. The hot spot becomes larger and hotter as shown in Figure 4f.

Figure 4 Spatial distributions
of temperature at the time of hot spot growth
for crystals under the impact velocity of 2 km·s–1 (a,c,e) and 4 km·s–1 (b,d,f). Panels (c,d)
correspond to the max compression for Up = 2 km·s–1 at t = 7.8 ps, Up = 4 km·s–1 at t = 5.3 ps, respectively, while panels (e,f) represent the
time before spalling for Up = 2 km·s–1, Up = 4 km·s–1 at t = 12.5 ps, t = 9.0 ps, respectively.

Whether hot spots will continue to grow or quench depends
on the
balance between energy release caused by local physical and chemical
reactions and various heat dissipation mechanisms.8 Combining with the time evolution of the size and peak
temperature of hot spot, it can be seen that hot spot would grow for Up = 4 km·s–1, while quench
to some extent for Up = 2 km·s–1 in our simulation.

3.3 Spalling
The shock wave reflects
from the free surface at the right end of the RDX crystal to form
a tensile wave and thus results in local tensile stress on the free
surface at the right end. If the tensile stress satisfies the dynamic
fracture criterion, the material will fail and the fragments would
fly out with a certain momentum. Figure 5 illustrates the snapshots of the spalling
process of RDX crystals under impact velocity of 2 km·s–1. At 12.5 ps, a plastic deformation region is formed at the right
end of the crystal under the action of tension wave (marked in Figure 5a). At 13.5 and 14.2
ps, the typical spallation phenomena, that is the fracture of materials
initiated by the tensile stress of RDX crystals satisfying the dynamic
fracture criteria, can be observed. This is due to the fact that the
hot spot strengthens the leading shock wave and reflects it to form
a strong tensile zone. At 15.6 ps, the secondary shock wave generated
by the hot spot catches up with the initial shock wave, and then the
spallation phenomenon disappears. (Also see the Supporting Movie SM1).

Figure 5 Snapshots of spalling process of RDX crystals
under an impact velocity
of 2 km·s–1. Panel (a) represents elastic deformation
by initial reflection shockwave, (b,c) correspond to mircospalling
and spalling, respectively, and (d) represents crystals tension by
secondary shockwave.

As shown in Figure 5, the spalling occurs at 330–400 Å in the X direction for Up = 2 km·s–1. Figure 6 shows the
spatial and temporal distribution of density in the above regions.
There are no atoms in the spalling region, and the density is close
to zero, as indicated by the dark blue in Figure 6. Once the shock wave propagates to the free
surface right end (t = 8.0 ps), the reflected tensile
wave propagates along the X negative direction. Under
the action of tensile wave and shock wave, the spalling occurs at
a specific location. In this paper, the initial position of spallation
which can be calculated by the average sound velocity inside the RDX
crystal is at 330 Å at 12.3 ps (see in Figure 6a). The calculated sound velocity is 2.25
km·s–1, which is close to the 2.8 km·s–1 (for ρ = 1.80 g·cm–3) in the handbook34 The difference is
due to the inhomogeneity of density within the crystal. The spalling
region expands continually under the dual action of shock waves and
tensile waves and reaches a maximum at 14.0 ps (Figure 6d). After that, the secondary shock wave
drives the atoms in the crystal to propagate along the X positive direction, and the spalling gradually disappears (Figure 6f).

Figure 6 Spatial distributions
of density at the time of spalling evolution
under the impact velocity of 2 km·s–1. Panel
(a) represents the beginning of spalling; (b–d) represent the
growth of spalling; and (e,f) represent the disappearance of spalling.

To further characterize the expand
and disappearance of spallation
regions, the spalling region analysis was implemented using a series
of PYTHON scripts. Figure 7 shows the time-dependent evolution of the projected area
of region A (in Figure 6a) on the XY plane. It has been seen that the expand
and decay times of spalling are almost the same in Figure 7. The relationship between
the projection area in the XY plane and time is similar
parabolic by the polynomial fitting method (see more details about
the parabolic formula in Supporting Information S4). The rate of growth of the spalling region can be calculated
about 70 Å2/ps, and the decay rate is 82 Å2/ps.

Figure 7 Evolution of the projected area of region A (in Figure 6a) on the XY plane.

Figure 8 shows the
snapshots of microsplit and secondary reflection tension of RDX crystals
under the impact velocity of 4 km·s–1. For Up = 4 km·s–1, there are
many obvious microsplit regions in the inner cleavage zone of RDX
crystals, which shows a loose porous state (marked with circles in Figure 8b, see the density
distribution for Up = 4 km·s–1 in Supporting Information S5). Comparing with Figures 5 and 8, it can be seen that the structure
of spallation zone strongly depends on the velocity and formation
of shock wave: typical spallation occurs at low shock velocity (Figure 5b,c), while microsplit
occurs at high shock velocity (Figure 8b). The interaction between the shock wave and the
closure void would again reflect the formation of the unloading wave
propagating along the x negative direction. The shock
wave propagating along the x positive direction is
continuously strengthened under the action of the hot spot, and it
then reflects as a strong unloading wave after arriving at the right
end free surface. The compression wave interacts with the strong unloading
wave in the hot spot region, and it continuously stretches the sparse
high-density region. The shock wave drives the left side of the crack
to collide with the right side to catch up with the right spalling
zone and make the crack disappear (Figure 8c,d). (Also see the Supporting Movie SM2).

crystals under the impact velocity of 4 km·s–1. Panel (a) represents the initial expansion stage; (b) corresponds
to mircosplit; (c) represents the microsplit healing process; and
(d) represents the disappearance of microsplit.

Because of the instability of energetic materials, the spalling
phenomenon of energetic materials can hardly be observed. In recent
years, research studies on spallation are mostly focused on metals.35,36 For example, Luo et al.35 indicate that
spallation occurs without tensile melting due to the weak solid shocks
of Cu; in addition, spallation may be accompanied or preceded by partial
melting at the case of stronger shocks. Xiang et al.36 revealed that classical spallation occurs where materials
keep in solid state during shock compression and tensile stages, while
microspallation is a spallation where melting occurs during shock
compression and tensile stages, as in the case of Pb. Unlike metals,
there are many chemical reactions in energetic materials by shock
loading, which complicates the mechanism of spallation.

3.4 Chemical Reaction
The threshold of
impact initiation of RDX crystal is 34.7 GPa.34 The shock pressures Ps, calculated using
the Rankine–Hugoniot relation Ps = ρ0UsUp, where ρ0 is the initial density of
the crystal, were 14.4 and 57.8 GPa for the impact velocities of Up = 2 and 4 km·s–1, respectively.
Obviously, the shock pressure is less than the impact initiation threshold
for Up = 2 km·s–1. Only a little RDX molecules react and concentrate around the hot
spot region (quantity is too small to be listed). As seen in Figure 9, there is almost
no decomposition reaction of the RDX molecules near the spalling region.
On the contrary, there are large number of small molecule products
for Up = 4 km·s–1. These gaseous products, such as H2O, CO2,
NO2, NO3, O2, and so forth, which
were around the microsplit region (Figure 10a,b) may be responsible for the occurrence
of microsplit. The strong shock wave induces the decomposition of
RDX into gas products, which move in the crystal under the action
of shock wave, and makes the RDX crystal appear a loose porous state.

Figure 9 Snapshots
of spalling region of RDX crystals under the impact velocity
of 2 km·s–1 at t = 14 ps.
The X direction is 300–400 Å, and Y direction is 51–75 Å. C, H, O, and N are presented
by gray, white, red, and blue balls, respectively.

Figure 10 Snapshots of the microsplit regions of RDX crystals for Up = 4 km·s–1 at t = 10 ps (a), t = 11 ps (b). C, H, O,
N are presented by gray, white, red, and blue balls, respectively.

The ruptures of N–NO2 bond are the main initial
reaction mechanisms for the shocked RDX crystal and are not affected
by shock strength. NO2 and C3H6O4N5 appear earlier, and their amounts are much higher
than the other products. Note that there are more NO2 molecules
than C3H6O4N5, suggesting
that some RDX molecules lost two NO2 groups, which is confirmed
by the presence of C3H6O2N4 (Figure 11b). It
can be seen from Figure 11a that the decomposition rate of RDX molecules can be divided
into three stages. First, RDX molecules decompose rapidly under the
action of shock wave before the maximum compression time. Second,
the decomposition rate of RDX molecules is slow at the time of maximum
compression, while the formation rate of small molecular products
such as NO2, CO2, HO increases. This also confirms
that the increase and mobility of small gas products are the main
reasons for the formation of microcracks in the crystal. Third, after
the microsplit disappeared, RDX molecules decompose rapidly and the
amount of NO2 decreases rapidly. NO3, NO, HONO,
and other active intermediate products are involved in the chemical
reaction as shown in Figure 11b.

velocity

of the main product; (b) represents the evolution of the intermediate
product.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, the physical and chemical phenomena of RDX crystal
with a cube void are simulated under different shock velocities by
using ReaxFF/lg force field. The void collapse process, hot spot formation
and growth, and spallation phenomena are analyzed.

Once the
initial shock wave arrives upstream surface of the void,
the particles upstream of the void begin to enter the void, which
lead to void collapse. The time intensity of void collapse depends
on the velocity of collision. The corresponding void collapse times
are 1.5 and 0.7 ps, in the case of Up =
2 km·s–1 and Up = 4 km·s–1, respectively. The shock wave
velocity Us averaged before the void collapse
is calculated to be around 4.0 and 8.5 km·s–1. The internal temperature of the void is higher than 2500 K, and
the hot spot where the shape remains radially symmetrical is formed
after void collapse. The shock wave initiated by hot spot propagates
forward in a convex plane way. Nucleation and growth of hot spots
are also important processes that induce chemical reactions in the
system. In a limited simulation time in case of Up = 2 km·s–1, the hot spot features
certain amounts of attenuation with the shock wave propagation, and
thus the peak temperature of the hot spot gradually decreases from
the initial 3300–1900 K; while in the case of Up = 4 km·s–1, the hot spot area
is constantly expanding, and the temperature maintains at a higher
temperature. The tensile wave reflected by the shock wave after reaching
the free surface results in stretching of the material and spalling
that depends on the initial shock velocity. Typical spalling occurs
for the shock velocity 2 km·s–1, while the
tensile wave induces the microsplit region in RDX crystals in the
case of Up = 4 km·s–1. The secondary reflection of shock wave in the material further
expands the material and catches up with the spallation zone, which
makes the crack disappear. Shock pressures can be calculated using
the Rankine–Hugoniot relation ware 14.4, 57.8 GPa for Up = 2 and 4 km·s–1, respectively.
For the weak shock, there is almost no decomposition reaction of the
RDX molecules and around the spalling region are entire RDX molecules.
On the contrary, there are large number of small molecule products,
such as H2O, CO2, NO2, and so forth,
around the microsplit regions for the strong shock. The formation
and movement of gaseous small molecules may be the main reason for
the formation of microcracks. The initial reaction mechanism of the
RDX crystal which is rupture of N–NO2 bond is independent
of the impact strength, while the microsplit slows down the decomposition
rate of RDX.

The results in this paper can shed light on thermal
ignition, hot
spot growth, and other physical and chemical phenomena of energetic
materials under impact loading. Future researches will focus on the
effects of void shape, size, and void interactions on hot spots and
chemical reactions to better understand the relationship between crystal
properties and the impact response of energetic materials.
