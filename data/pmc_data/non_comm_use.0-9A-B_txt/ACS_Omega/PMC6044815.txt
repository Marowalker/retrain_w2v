Calcium
bisphosphonate/calcium polyacrylate spheres were synthesized
by a facile method and applied for the first time as gene vectors
for transfection. The colloidal spheres of the PAA–Ca2+–H2O complex, formed by sodium polyacrylate and
calcium ions in the solution, were used as template to synthesize
a spherical PAA–Ca2+–BPMP composite (CaBPMP/CaPAA)
in the presence of 1,4-bis(phosphomethyl)piperazine (BPMP). The CaBPMP/CaPAA
composite exhibits uniform and well-dispersed spheres with a particle
size of about 200 nm as expected. The cytotoxicity assays confirm
that CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres are quite safe for different cells even
at a high concentration of 500 μg/mL. In vitro transfection
results show that CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres serving as gene vectors are
capable of transferring exogenous genes into different cells with
about 25% of transfection efficiency and good reproducibility. The
transfection capacity of CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres may be attributed to
the controllable sphere morphology, low cytotoxicity, moderate DNA
loading capacity, and bioresorbable property. The application of calcium
phosphonates with adjustable surface properties derived from the different
organic groups of phosphonic acid in gene delivery provides a new
design idea for gene vectors.

1 Introduction
The
metal phosphonates as representative organic–inorganic
hybrid materials have exhibited excellent physicochemical properties
for various applications in the fields of adsorption, separation,
catalysis, etc., due to their unique tailorable frameworks allowing
selection of appropriate metals and phosphonic acids with special
organic groups to combine different functionalities into one.1,2 During the past 2 decades, many efforts have been made to control
the pore structure of metal phosphonates, and a lot of encouraging
results have been achieved.3−6 However, it is still challenging to precisely control
the spherical morphology of metal phosphonates due to their rapid
precipitation in solution. So far, most of the research relating to
the control of the spherical morphology focuses on aluminum phosphonates,7−11 tin phosphonates,12,13 and transition metal phosphonates;14−17 the reports of spherical calcium phosphonates are scarce.

It is well known that calcium phosphate (CaP) nanoparticles are
promising nonviral inorganic vectors for gene delivery due to their
capacity of transfection of various mammalian cells in vitro, as well
as low immune responses and cytotoxicity.18−20 The calcium
phosphonates can be regarded as organic-functionalized CaP, wherein
the special organic functional groups can endow the materials with
positive-charge surface properties, which is the desired property
for the application in gene delivery. As far as we know, the application
of calcium phosphonates in gene delivery has not been known until
now. Thus, for the first time, calcium phosphonate spheres with uniform
morphology have been designed and synthesized for gene delivery in
this article.

Here, the calcium bisphosphonate spheres were
synthesized using
1,4-bis(phosphomethyl) piperazine (BPMP) with a piperazine group through
the colloid template method. The PAA–Ca2+–H2O colloid spheres, formed by sodium polyacrylate (PAAS) and
calcium ions in the solution, were selected as the template because
their particle diameter can be precisely adjusted by the complexation
time within limits.21,22 In addition, the colloidal spheres
of PAA–Ca2+–H2O as the template
can control the final product with a regular sphere shape and submicrometer
size by providing calcium ions for bisphophonates to form calcium
bisphosphonates. Such a submicrosphere morphology effectively inhibits
the resulting particles from aggregating into a block during the transfection,
as opposed to their nanoscale analogue, due to the low surface energy.
In addition, PAA present in the colloidal spheres of the PAA–Ca2+–H2O template is nontoxic and biocompatible,
which has been proven by its wide application in bioadhesive and pH-controlled
drug-delivery systems.23−27 1,4-bis(phosphomethyl)piperazine (BPMP) has been selected to construct
calcium bisphosphonate to provide a positive-charge surface property,
which effectively improves the gene-loading capacity of the material.
In fact, BPMP can provide zirconium bisphosphonates with a cationic
surface property through the protonation of the piperazine groups,
which has been achieved in our previous study.28,31 Moreover, these pH-sensitive zirconium bisphosphonates have been
applied in colon-targeted drug delivery of negatively charged diclofenac
sodium, insulin, and nucleic acid because of their pH sensitivity
and biocompatibility.29−31 Therefore, the application of calcium bisphosphonate
spheres with uniform morphology as a new vector for gene delivery
is anticipated. To evaluate the performance of calcium bisphosphonate
spheres as gene vectors, DNA loading capacity, DNA retardation assay,
DNase I stability assay, and DNA release study, as well as the cytotoxicity
and transfection efficiency of the calcium bisphosphonate/calcium
polyacrylate composite for different cells in vitro, were investigated
in detail.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
and Characterization
It
is demonstrated that PAAS with a medium molecular weight in the aqueous
solution containing calcium ions can form colloidal spheres, wherein
calcium ions coordinate with the carboxyl groups in polyacrylate instead
of acting as counterions.32−34 More specifically, the carboxyl
groups in polyacrylate adopted different coordination modes to coordinate
with calcium ions, which caused polyacrylate chains to coil and shrink
forming colloidal spheres of the PAA–Ca2+–H2O complex through hydrophobic interaction.32,35−38 Moreover, the reported study discovered that colloidal spheres of
the PAA–Ca2+–H2O complex grew
from 160 ± 40 to 490 ± 100 nm with the complexation time
increasing from 3 min to 24 h.21 Here,
the colloidal PAA–Ca2+–H2O spheres
were used as a template for the synthesis of the calcium bisphosphonate/calcium
polyacrylate composite, wherein the PAA–Ca2+–H2O complex can provide unsaturated coordinated calcium ions
for BPMP to further form the PAA–Ca2+–BPMP
composite with controlled sphere morphology.

The morphology
of the as-synthesized CaBPMP/CaPAA composite was first characterized
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Figure 1a. As can be seen from Figure 1a, the sample comprised
relatively uniform and well-dispersed spheres with the diameter in
the range between 150 and 250 nm. The transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) image (Figure 1b) also reveals that the resultant CaBPMP/CaPAA composite comprised
regular spheres with good dispersity. No porosity can be observed
in the CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres in the TEM image with a higher magnification
(Figure 1c), which
is in agreement with the result of the N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherm (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information).
The CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres are amorphous due to the low reaction temperature,
which can be confirmed by the powder XRD pattern with a broad hump
at about 20°, characteristic of the amorphous phase (Figure S2). The dynamic light scattering result
shows that the average hydrodynamic diameter of the CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres
was about 209 ± 33 nm.

Figure 1 Morphology of CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres: (a) SEM
image; (b) TEM image;
(c) high-resolution (HR) TEM image.

The chemical compositions of the CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres were
characterized
by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and solid-state 31P and 13C MAS NMR spectra. From the FT-IR spectrum of
the CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres (Figure 2d), a broad absorption band centered at 1100 cm–1 can be assigned to Ca–O–P stretching
vibration in accordance with that in the FT-IR spectrum of CaBPMP
synthesized directly without colloidal spheres of the PAA–Ca2+–H2O complex as the template (Figure 2c), indicating that
phosphonyl groups in BPMP have coordinated to the calcium ions on/into
the PAA–Ca2+–H2O colloid spheres.
The presence of an absorption band at 983 cm–1 related
with free P–OH in Figure 2c,d suggests that the surface defect sites exist in
CaBPMP regardless of whether PAA–Ca2+–H2O colloid spheres are used as a template or not. In addition,
the strong absorption peaks located at 1560 and 1415 cm–1 are attributed to antisymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations
of the carboxyl groups in polyacrylate, respectively (Figure 2d). The difference (Δ
= 145 cm–1) between νasym(CO2) 1560 cm–1 and νsym(CO2) 1415 cm–1 in Figure 2d is similar to that of uncoordinated carboxylate
ions of PAAS, as shown in Figure 2b (Δ = 163 cm–1, νasym(CO2) 1570 cm–1, and νsym(CO2) 1407 cm–1), indicating
that there are carboxyl groups adopting a bridging coordination mode
in the CaBPMP/CaPAA composite. This provides an evidence for the existence
of the PAA–Ca2+–H2O complex in
CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres.

Figure 2 FT-IR spectra of (a) BPMP; (b) PAAS; (c) CaBPMP; (d) CaBPMP/CaPAA.

The 31P MAS NMR spectrum
of CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres is
shown in Figure 3;
two overlapped resonance peaks centered at 15.5 and 7.7 ppm can be
attributed to two kinds organic phosphorus species with different
oxygen coordination environments, further demonstrating the coordination
of phosphonyl groups in BPMP with calcium ions. Figure 4b presents the 13C CP/MAS NMR
spectrum of CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres, in which a strong resonance peak
centered at 187.3 ppm can be assigned to the carbon atom of carbonyl
in polyacrylate, and two overlapped broad resonance peaks located
at 47.6 and 44.4 ppm are attributed to the carbon atom linked with
phosphorus in the phosphonyl group and nitrogen in the piperazine
group of BPMP, respectively. In comparison with the 13C
CP/MAS NMR spectrum of BPMP (Figure 4a), the resonance peaks relating to CaBPMP obviously
broaden and shift to upfield about 5 ppm, which may be due to the
coordination of the phosphonyl groups in BPMP with calcium ions and
the formation of hydrogen bonding (O–H···O)
between the phosphonyl groups with P–OH in BPMP and oxygen
of the carboxyl groups in polyacrylate. The results of FT-IR, together
with solid-state NMR, show the incorporation of BPMP on/into PAA–Ca2+–H2O colloid spheres through the coordination
between phosphonyl groups and calcium ions and confirm that BPMP can
retain its structural integrity during the synthesis process.

spheres (* refers to spinning side bands).

2.2 Cytotoxicity of CaBPMP/CaPAA Spheres
The future application of CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres as vectors for gene
delivery requires them to exhibit no cytotoxicity or low cytotoxicity.
To evaluate the cytotoxicity of CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres, in vitro cytotoxicity
assays using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) method were conducted against NIH-3T3 cells and RBL-2H3
cells by measuring the viability of cells. The viability of NIH-3T3
cells and RBL-2H3 cells at different concentrations of CaBPMP/CaPAA
spheres is displayed in Figure 5. As can been seen in Figure 5a, the CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres at concentrations below
500 μg/mL exert no effect on NIH-3T3 cells, that is, CaBPMP/CaPAA
spheres in such a concentration range (0.5–500 μg/mL)
exhibit no cytotoxicity to NIH-3T3 cells. However, the viability of
NIH-3T3 cells obviously reduces with the increase in the concentration
of the CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres. The ∼14 and ∼25% decrease
of NIH-3T3 cells’ viability can be observed for CaBPMP/CaPAA
spheres at concentrations as high as 1000 and 2000 μg/mL, respectively,
showing that CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres at higher concentrations exhibit
cytotoxic effects on NIH-3T3 cells. However, for RBL-2H3 cells, the
change trend of cell viability with the increase in the concentration
of CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres is similar to that of NIH-3T3 cells, as shown
in Figure 5b, that
is, CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres also exhibit no cytotoxicity for RBL-2H3
cells until the concentration increases beyond 500 μg/mL. The
MTT assays demonstrate that CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres at concentrations
less than 500 μg/mL are safe for both NIH-3T3 cells and RBL-2H3
cells. It is believed that CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres with good biocompatibility
and low cytotoxicity would be suitable to act as gene vectors for
transfection.

concentrations
against (a) NIH-3T3 cells; (b) RBL-2H3 cells. Data are presented as
means ± SD from three biological replicates (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01).

2.3 GPF pDNA-Loaded CaBPMP/CaPAA Spheres
To obtain the positive-charge surface property, the CaBPMP/CaPAA
spheres were protonated in an acidic solution before loading the DNA.
Unfortunately, the positive-charged surface property of CaBPMP/CaPAA
spheres cannot be realized because acid-labile PAA–Ca2+–H2O colloid spheres as a template exhibited good
dissolubility at low pH values during the process of protonation.
The zeta potentials of PAA–Ca2+–H2O colloid spheres and CaBPMP/CaPPA spheres were measured, and negative
potentials of −31.7 and −25 mV, respectively, were obtained.
Although the surface property was not positive, CaBPMP/CaPPA can still
load DNA through calcium ions as counterions. The CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres
after loading with GFP pDNA were characterized by SEM, particle size
distribution, and zeta potential. The SEM image of GFP pDNA-loaded
CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres shows that CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres can still retain
their original sphere morphology after loading with GFP pDNA (Figure S3). The dynamic light scattering result
further confirms that the average hydrodynamic diameter of GFP pDNA-loaded
CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres was about 256 ± 49 nm, which is slightly
larger than that of unloaded CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres (209 ± 33 nm).
The ζ-potential of GFP pDNA-loaded CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres was
−35.6 mV, which is more negative than that of unloaded CaBPMP/CaPAA
spheres (−25 mV). The above results demonstrate that the GFP
pDNA molecules twine around the CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres through electrostatic
interactions via calcium ions surrounding the CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres
and acting as counterions.

The DNA retardation assay of the
GFP pDNA–CaBPMP/CaPAA complex was investigated by agarose gel
electrophoresis using GFP pDNA as a control. As shown in Figure 6a, the migration
of GFP pDNA was retarded by CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres when the CaBPMP/CaPAA
spheres/GFP pDNA weight ratio changed from 0.5 to 2.5 (lanes 2–6)
in comparison with that of GFP pDNA alone in the absence of CaBPMP/CaPAA
spheres (lane 1). The result suggests that CaBPMP/CaPAA microspheres
possess good DNA-binding ability due to the strong affinity between
CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres and GFP pDNA through calcium ions as counterions.
The DNase I stability assay of the pDNA–CaBPMP/CaPAA complex
was performed, and the images of agarose gel electrophoresis are displayed
in Figure 6b. It is
obvious that the naked GFP pDNA was almost completely degraded in
the presence of DNase I, which is proved by the fact that the band
of GFP pDNA cannot be clearly observed (lane 2). However, the migration
of GFP pDNA was observed after the GFP pDNA–CaBPMP/CaPAA complex
at CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres/GFP pDNA weight ratios of 0.5–2.5 was
digested by DNase I and treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
solution (lanes 3–7), demonstrating that CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres
exert protective effects on GFP pDNA against DNase I. The GFP pDNA
release by the GFP pDNA–CaBPMP/CaPAA complex is also presented
in the agarose gel electrophoresis images, as shown in Figure 6c. The migration of GFP pDNA
can be observed for the eluent of the GFP pDNA–CaBPMP/CaPAA
complex (lanes 2–6 corresponding to CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres/GFP
pDNA weight ratios of 0.5–2.5, respectively). Furthermore,
the band of GFP pDNA after release is identical to that of the native
GFP pDNA (lane 1), meaning that GFP pDNA can still retain its structure
intact after eluting from the GFP pDNA–CaBPMP/CaPAA complex,
that is, CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres as gene vectors have no effect on the
structure integrity of loaded DNA.

2.4 In Vitro Transfection Using
CaBPMP/CaPAA Spheres
as Gene Vectors
To value the transfection activity of CaBPMP/CaPAA
spheres, green fluorescent protein-coding plasmid DNA (GFP pDNA) as
the model gene and two kinds of cells (NIH-3T3 cells and RBL-2H3 cells)
as model cells were selected for the research.

In vitro transfection
experiments for NIH-3T3 cells were performed using different amounts
of CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres to explore the optimal ratio of vectors/DNA.
The transfection results are summarized in Figure 7, and the corresponding flow cytometry histogram
profiles are listed in Figure S4. It is
clear that the transfection efficiency was constant at about 25% when
the amount of GFP pDNA was 20 μg and the amount of CaBPMP/CaPAA
vectors varied from 5 to 50 μg, which means that the amount
of GFP pDNA is enough for CaBPMP/CaPAA vectors and that no no-load
CaBPMP/CaPAA vectors exist during the transfection. The negative control
experiment was also conducted by using CaBPMP/CaPAA vectors (50 μg)
and a plasmid (PcDNA 3.1(+), 20 μg), which does not encode for
any fluorescent proteins, to exclude the autofluorescence signals
of CaBPMP/CaPAA vectors during transfection.

Figure 7 Transfection efficiency
using different amounts of CaBPMP/CaPAA
vectors and 20 μg of GFP pDNA for NIH-3T3 cells: 0 (blank);
5; 10; 20; 30; 40; 50 μg; negative control (50 μg of CaBPMP/CaPAA
vectors and 20 μg of PcDNA 3.1(+)).

In view of the fact that calcium ions can enhance the transfection
efficiency of CaP/polymer as per the previous reference,43 in vitro transfection experiments for NIH-3T3
cells were also carried out in the presence of calcium ions. The transfection
activity of GFP pDNA in the presence of CaCl2 was investigated
to eliminate the effect of calcium ions on the cytomembrane. A transfection
efficiency of 3.5% was obtained using GFP pDNA in the presence of
CaCl2, which is almost equal to that of the blank experiment
(only using GFP pDNA, 3.3%), showing that calcium ions at this concentration
exert no effect on the cytomembrane. As observed in Figures 8 and S5a, the transfection efficiency of CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres for NIH-3T3
cells in the presence of CaCl2 shows almost no change in
comparison with that in the absence of CaCl2, suggesting
that calcium ions have little impact on the transfection activity
of CaBPMP/CaPPA vectors. This can be explained by the fact that CaBPMP/CaPAA
spheres have a negative ζ-potential of −26.3 mV in the
synthesis condition, which causes calcium ions to surround CaBPMP/CaPAA
spheres acting as counterions in the synthesis system. Thus, the addition
of calcium ions in the transfection experiments would not serve as
linkers to bind GFP pDNA with CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres, resulting in no
further increase of DNA loading of the CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres.

(from left to right as follows: GFP pDNA (blank); GFP pDNA in the
presence of CaCl2; CaBPMP/CaPPA; CaBPMP/CaPAA in the presence
of CaCl2; Lipofecter liposome (5 μg of CaBPMP/CaPPA,
20 μg of GFP pDNA, 3.75 mmol/L CaCl2) (p < 0.05)).

For NIH-3T3 cells, the
transfection efficiency using CaBPMP/CaPAA
spheres as gene vectors is 25.1%, which is 7–8 times higher
than that using the standard CaP method39 and is also higher than that of modified CaP39−41 (Figure 8). However, the transfection
activity of CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres cannot compare with the reported
CaP–polymer composites in the previous references,42,43 in which a luciferase-expressing plasmid was used for transfection
and the luciferase activity instead of explicit transfection efficiency
was used to express transfection activity in the transfection results.
Hence, a control transfection experiment was conducted using Lipofecter
liposome to estimate CaBPMP/CaPAA vector’s transfection activity.
The transfection efficiency of Lipofecter liposome (control group)
was 39.7% for NIH-3T3 cells, as displayed in Figures 8 and S5a. The
CaBPMP/CaPAA vector’s transfection efficiency for NIH-3T3 cells
can reach 63% of that of Lipofecter liposome, suggesting that CaBPMP/CaPAA
vectors are effective in gene delivery. The transfection capacity
of the CaBPMP/CaPAA vector can be further improved if cell-targeting
peptides are used during the transfection, as reported in previous
references.44,45

The transfection activity
of CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres was also investigated
using RBL-2H3 cells (Figures 8 and S5b). The transfection efficiency
of CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres in the absence of CaCl2 and in
the presence of CaCl2 is 23.6 and 25.9%, respectively.
It is obvious that the transfection results of CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres
for RBL-2H3 cells are consistent with those of NIH-3T3 cells. The
CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres exhibit similar transfection activity for NIH-3T3
cells and RBL-2H3 cells in transfection experiments, further demonstrating
that the new gene vector of CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres possesses consistent
transfection capacity for different cells and good reproducibility.
Even so, the transfection efficiency of CaBPMP/CaPPA is not as high
as that of bisphosphonate-stabilized CaP nanoparticles (PEG-NP) reported
in a previous reference,20 which is mainly
due to poor DNA-loading capacity for their more negative surface property,
lower surface energy, and less surface area derived from a larger
particle size.

To further visualize the transfection capacity
of CaBPMP/CaPAA
vectors, the intracellular GFP expression was observed using a confocal
laser scanning microscope (CLSM). As shown in Figure 9C(C2,C3), the green fluorescent signal was
obviously observed in NIH-3T3 cells with the GFP pDNA–CaBPMP/CaPAA
complex formed by GFP pDNA and CaBPMP/CaPAA vectors, indicating that
GFP has been expressed after CaBPMP/CaPAA vectors carried GFP pDNA
into the cells. In contrast, the green fluorescent signal cannot be
seen in Figure 9A(A2,A3),
that is, no expression of GFP was observed in the cells when NIH-3T3
cells were transfected using GFP pDNA alone, which suggests that GFP
pDNA cannot enter into the cells without vectors. The result of CLSM
visually confirms that CaBPMP/CaPAA vectors are capable of carrying
exogenous genes into the cells and that exogenous genes can be further
expressed intracellularly.

3 Conclusions
In summary, CaBPMP/CaPAA
hybrid spheres have been successfully
synthesized through a facile method using PAA–Ca2+–H2O colloid spheres as a template and characterized
by SEM, TEM, powder XRD, particle size distribution, zeta potential,
FT-IR, and 31P and 13C MAS NMR. The electrophoresis
result indicated that CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres can effectively load, protect,
and release genes. MTT assays confirmed that CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres
are quite safe for different cells at high concentrations of 500 μg/mL.
Although the desired positive-charge surface property of CaBPMP/CaPAA
spheres cannot be realized through the protonation of the piperazine
group in BPMP under acidic conditions because acid-labile PAA–Ca2+–H2O colloid spheres as a template exhibited
good dissolubility at low pH values during the process of protonation,
the CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres acting as gene vectors are able to transfer
GFP pDNA into different cells with 25% transfection efficiency and
good reproducibility. The transfection performance of CaBPMP/CaPAA
spheres in gene delivery can be attributed to their uniform spherical
morphology, appropriate particle size, and good dispersity, which
favor efficient entry into cells through endocytosis. From another
point of view, good dissolubility of PAA–Ca2+–H2O colloid spheres as a template at low pH values makes CaBPMP/CaPAA
spheres release the loaded gene in the endosome under a weak acidic
environment (pH value of about 5.4), which is conductive to gene transfection
because intracellular gene release determines subsequent gene expression.
The controllable morphology, low cytotoxicity, moderate gene-loading
capacity, and different dissolubilities at different pH values cause
CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres to become promising vectors for gene delivery.
The application of calcium phosphonates with adjustable surface properties
derived from the different organic groups of phosphonic acid in gene
delivery provides a new idea for the design of gene vectors. Furthermore,
it is worth mentioning that bisphosphonates are efficient anticancer
drugs and have wide clinical applications at present. Provided that
the used bisphosphonates possess excellent anticancer activity, the
calcium bisphosphonate/calcium polyacrylate spheres might provide
a new modality for delivery of bisphosphonate-based anticancer drugs
into cancer cells.

BRUKER DRX 400 spectrometer equipped with a magic-angle spin probe
in a 4 mm ZrO2 rotor. 13C signals were referenced
to tetramethylsilane, and 31P NMR signal was referenced
to NH4H2PO4. The experimental parameters
were 6 kHz spin rate, 2 s pulse delay, 6 min contact time for 13C CP-MAS NMR experiments; 8 kHz spin rate, 3 s pulse delay,
and 10 min contact time for the 31P MAS NMR experiment.
MTT assays were performed on a Tecan M200 ELISA reader at 492 nm.
The transfection efficiency was obtained at 480 nm using BD Accuri
C6 flow cytometry through channel FL1.

4.2 Synthesis
The calcium bisphosphonate/calcium
polyacrylate composite was prepared using colloidal spheres of the
PAA–Ca2+–H2O complex as the template.
In a typical synthesis, the solution of PAAS (8 mmol/L of the repeating
units) was first prepared at 30 °C under gentle magnetic stirring,
and the pH value of the PAAS solution was adjusted to 11 by aqueous
ammonia. Then, 30 mL of the calcium nitrate solution (0.1 mol/L) was
added to 355 mL of pre-prepared PAAS solution dropwise at 30 °C
under gentle magnetic stirring for 30 min. The obtained solution was
bluish, which can be recognized as characteristic for the formation
of PAA–Ca2+–H2O colloid spheres
with a submicrometer size (Figure S6).
Afterward, BPMP solution (0.1 mol/L, 15 mL) with pH 11 adjusted by
aqueous ammonia was added dropwise to the above bluish solution, and
the mixture was further stirred for 24 h at 30 °C. The resultant
was collected by high-speed centrifugation, washed with pure water
and anhydrous ethanol, and dried at room temperature in a vacuum oven.
Hereafter, the synthesized calcium bisphosphonate/calcium polyacrylate
composite was designated as CaBPMP/CaPAA.

4.3 Cytotoxicity
Assays of CaBPMP/CaPAA Spheres
Cytotoxicity was tested using
the MTT assay by measuring the cell
viability. NIH-3T3 cells or RBL-2H3 cells in the logarithmic growth
phase were digested by 0.25% of trypsin and then a DMEM culture medium
containing 10% FBS was added to terminate cell dissociation and obtain
a cell suspension. The cell suspension (100 μL) was seeded in
96-well plates with a cell density of 8 × 103 cells/well
and cultured at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere with 5% CO2 for 24 h. CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres were suspended in the DMEM culture
medium containing 10% FBS and 100 IU/mL penicillin–streptomycin.
The particle suspension was added into each well, and the final concentration
of the particles was adjusted to 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000,
and 2000 μg/mL. After culturing at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere
with 5% CO2 for 48 h, the culture medium was removed and
cells were rinsed with PBS solution. MTT solution (100 μL) with
a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL was added to each well and incubated
for another 4 h. The medium containing MTT was removed and 150 μL
of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each well under shaking for 10
min to dissolve Formazan. Afterward, the supernatant was measured
by ELISA at a wavelength of 492 nm. The cell viability was normalized
as a percentage of the cells treated with CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres compared
with that of untreated cells. Statistical analysis was carried out
with three biological replicates for this study. The results were
statistically analyzed by one-way ANOVA and the Duncan’s new
multiple range test to determine the significant difference between
group means. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant (SPSS for Windows, version 12.0).

4.4 DNA Retardation
Assay, DNase I Stability Assay,
and DNA Release Study
The GFP pDNA (1 μg) and GFP pDNA–CaBPMP/CaPAA
complexes (the weight ratios of CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres/GFP pDNA are
0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5, respectively) were loaded onto 0.8% agarose
gels with ethidium bromide (0.1 μg/mL) and were run with a tris-acetate
running buffer at 80 V for 50 min. Then, the DNA retardation was observed
by agarose gels electrophoresis.

DNase I (3 U, 1 μL) was
added to 1 μg of naked GFP pDNA and GFP pDNA–CaBPMP/CaPAA
complexes (the weight ratios of CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres/GFP pDNA were
0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5, respectively), which was incubated at 37°C
for 30 min with shaking at 100 rpm. The DNase I degradation was ended
by adding a solution of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (250 mM, 4
μL). Then, GFP pDNA was released by incubation with the PBS
buffer (5 μL, 0.1 mol/L) at 37°C for 3.5 h with shaking
at 100 rpm. The naked GFP pDNA, the degraded GFP pDNA, and the released
samples were loaded onto 0.8% agarose gels with ethidium bromide (0.1
μg/mL) and run with the running buffer at 80 V for 50 min.

The GFP pDNA was released from GFP pDNA–CaBPMP/CaPAA complexes
(the different weight ratios of CaBPMP/CaPAA spheres/GFP pDNA were
0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5, respectively) by incubating with the PBS
buffer (5 μL, 0.1 mol/L) at 37°C for 3.5 h with shaking
at 100 rpm. The samples including original GFP pDNA and the released
GFP pDNA were loaded onto 0.8% agarose gels with ethidium bromide
(0.1 μg/mL) and run with the tris-acetate running buffer at
80 V for 50 min.

4.5 In Vitro Transfection Using
CaBPMP/CaPAA Spheres
as Gene Vectors
Cells from NIH-3T3 and RBL-2H3 cell lines
were plated in 12-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS at 37 °C in a
5% CO2 humidified atmosphere overnight. Then, the medium
was discarded and replaced with fresh DMEM with FBS. The different
amounts of CaBPMP/CaPAA vectors (5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 μg)
were suspended in 1 mL of the medium containing the same amount GFP
pDNA (20 μg), respectively. Then, the suspension with different
mass ratios of vector/DNA was added to each well. The GFP pDNA (20
μg) without CaBPMP/CaPAA vectors was used as the blank experiment,
whereas CaBPMP/CaPAA vectors (50 μg) and PcDNA 3.1(+) (20 μg)
were used as the negative control to exclude the autofluorescence
signals of CaBPMP/CaPAA vectors during transfection. The cells were
incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Afterward, the medium was replaced
with fresh DMEM medium with 20% FBS and incubated for 24 h. The medium
was again replaced with fresh DMEM medium with 10% FBS and incubated
for another 24 h. The transfection efficiency of CaBPMP/CaPAA vectors
was obtained at 480 nm using flow cytometry. The effect of calcium
ions on the transfection efficiency was determined according to the
above procedure using CaBPMP/CaPAA vectors (5 μg) and GFP pDNA
(20 μg) in the presence of CaCl2 (3.75 mmol/L). The
control transfection experiment of Lipofecter liposome was carried
out using Lipofecter liposome (50 μL) and GFP pDNA (20 μg)
according to the usage instruction for Lipofecter.

4.6 Intracellular Expression of GFP Observed by
CLSM
The GFP pDNA (20 μg), CaBPMP/CaPAA (5 μg),
and GFP pDNA–CaBPMP/CaPAA complex (w/w = 20/5 μg) were
incubated with NIH-3T3 cells for 4 h under the conditions mentioned
above, respectively. The cells were further incubated another 48 h,
followed by washed with PBS (pH 7.4). To label the nucleus, the cells
were incubated with DAPI for 10 min. Then, the cells were washed with
PBS (pH 7.4), and the intracellular expression of GFP in the cells
was observed by CLSM of Olympus Fluo View FV1000.
