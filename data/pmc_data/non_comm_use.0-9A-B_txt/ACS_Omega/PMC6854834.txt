Paris polyphylla var. yunnanensis is a famous medicinal plant distributed in some Asian countries.
This species has attracted a great deal of attention and is often
used as raw materials in traditional medicine practices. With the
purpose of gaining insight into the geoherbalism of wild P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis,
a total of 183 dried rhizome samples from eight different regions
including 16 typical or nontypical natural habitats have been analyzed
by multispectral information fusion based on ultraviolet and Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopies combined with partial least squares
discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and hierarchical cluster analysis.
From the results, the use of multispectral information fusion strategy
could improve the correct classification of samples, and good classification
performances have been shown according to PLS-DA models. The discrimination
of samples was obtained successfully with respect to the typical and
nontypical natural habitats, different collection areas of typical
natural habitats, and various sampling sites in nontypical natural
habitats. Additionally, the similarities among samples were presented
as well. Overall, the rhizome of wild P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis exhibited various regional dependence
and individual differences according to the geographical origins,
and the relatively appropriate growth region with better quality consistency
of samples was preliminarily selected. This study also revealed that
the developed multispectral information fusion method has the potential
to be a reliable analytical methodology for capturing the geoherbalism
differentiation in wild P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis. Furthermore, it could provide
more chemical evidence for the critical supplement of quality evaluation
on P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis.

1 Introduction
Medicinal
plants are often known as natural resources with valuable
health benefits and used for therapeutic purposes owing to their exhibition
of some special properties.1 In recent
years, they have drawn great particular concern because of their huge
medicinal and economic values. Apart from the conventional usages,
many species have been served for various other purposes, which are
related to health and personal care, including food supplements, health
foods, and herbal teas.2,3

The special status of medicinal
plants is likely to be derived
from their global complex chemical constituents, and the reliable
therapeutic effects are mainly expressed on the basis of these components
with complicated interactions.4 In addition,
the efficacy and safety of finished products are also directly dependent
on the quality and chemical profiles of medicinal plant raw materials.5 However, it has been widely recognized that medicinal
plants respond sensitively and rapidly to the stresses of environmental
changes and adapt to these changes during the growth period, which
gradually lead to the geoherbalism.6−8 Briefly, not only the
type of chemical compound but also the content of effective constituents
could exhibit variations under different environmental conditions.
For example, Qing et al.9 investigated Macleaya cordata from four different major areas
and found that the protopine-type alkaloid only existed in this species
collected from one of the studied regions. Additionally, as reported
by Melito et al.,10 the volatile fractions
of chemical profiles in Helichrysum italicum were quantitatively differentially produced in the plants from two
contrasting habitats (seaside and mountains). Hence, the study on
geographical origins of medicinal plants is of great importance if
the materials have relatively good qualities and uniform chemical
properties.

To investigate the medicinal plants with different
geographical
regions, it is crucial for analytical strategies to reflect the comprehensive
chemical features of the plants. With the development of analytical
methods, data fusion is a novel and practical one as well as an expanding
trend. This technique is a process that integrates multiple-source
information from different systems to obtain information of greater
quality and is focused on the characterization of a complex system
of a tested sample, which can be carried out basically at three levels
including data-level, feature-level, and decision-level fusion.11 In data-level fusion, data from all sources
are simply concatenated into a single matrix that has as many rows
as samples analyzed and as many columns as signals (variables) measured
by different instruments without additional mathematical preprocessing.12 Feature-level fusion could concatenate some
relevant features from each separate data source into a single dataset
that is used for multivariate classification. Moreover, the scores
of principal component analysis (PCA) or partial least squares discriminant
analysis (PLS-DA) are often used.13−15 For decision-level fusion,
the results from each individual classification are fused, and a classification
method is implemented for each data source.16 Generally, the first two data fusion methods are often used in many
fields such as food, mushrooms, medicinal plants, and so on. For example,
Dankowska et al.17 demonstrated that the
feature-level fusion of fluorescence and ultraviolet and visible (UV–Vis)
spectroscopies could give a complementary effect for the quantification
of roasted Coffea canephora var. robusta and Coffea arabica concentration in blends. Qi et al.18 investigated
Rhizoma Coptidis based on Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Fourier
transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopies as well as the data-level
and feature-level fusion, respectively, with the goal of confirming
the best discrimination model. Similarly, a previous study also showed
that near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectral techniques
could be fused together for distinguishing rhubarb samples that originated
from different areas of China and the improved classification model
could also be presented.19 Therefore, the
data fusion method could enhance the entire investigation ability
of each individual result and may exhibit strong potential to exploit
the differences as well as quality of medicinal plant raw materials.

Paris polyphylla var. yunnanensis, named “Dianchonglou” in Chinese, is a well-known
medicinal plant widely used in Asian countries including China, Vietnam,
Myanmar, and Nepal. The dried rhizome of this species is the main
medicinal part and is often sold in Chinese herbal medicine market.
In addition, it is one of the sources for Rhizome Paridis documented
officially in Chinese Pharmacopoeia (version 2015), and Rhizome Paridis
saponins are the main and active components in the rhizome of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis,
which is also the crucial raw material for some Chinese patent medicines
such as “Yunnan Baiyao”, “Gongxuening capsule”,
“Jidesheng Sheyao tablet”, etc., on the account of the
antitumor, anti-inflammatory, hemostatic, and anthelmintic efficiencies.20−23 Apart from the rhizome, the above-ground parts (especially the leaves)
are proposed to be an alternative and more sustainable source of active
ingredients compared to the rhizomes.24 In China, as an important medicinal plant resource, P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis is
mainly distributed in the southwestern regions.25 It is worth mentioning that Yunnan Province of China is
recognized as the typical natural habitat with better quality of this
species. Due to the gradually increasing market demand and supply
shortage of the wild resource, many materials collected from different
regions, even nontypical natural habitats, have flooded into the market.
From a previous study, the effective components of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis are
different in central, southern, and western Yunnan or in other geographical
locations in Yunnan Province.26 In this
case, there is a great need for the investigation and comparison of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis raw
materials with diverse geographical origins, which is connected with
the geoherbalism of this species as well as the recognition of certain
quality characteristics of the final certified products.

Accordingly,
in this research, preliminary exploration of multispectral
information fusion based on UV and FTIR spectroscopies together with
PLS-DA and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was carried out to
attempt some of geographical classification and differentiation of
the crude rhizome of wild P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis that originated from eight regions
in typical and nontypical natural habitats. Meanwhile, the discrimination
and comparison on the samples of typical and nontypical natural habitats,
different collection regions of typical natural habitats, and various
sampling sites in nontypical natural habitats were discussed. The
results may provide new insights into the current knowledge and may
be beneficial to future exploitation and utilization of this species
of medicinal plant.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Examination and Characterization of Original
Spectral Information
The average raw UV absorption spectra
obtained for the methanol extracts of rhizome of P.
polyphylla var. yunnanensis samples
that originated from eight regions in the range of 200–400
nm are shown in Figure 1A. Not only the similar spectral characteristics could be presented,
but also the distinctness in several featured peaks is visible, which
is typically considered for the initial comparison of samples. Obviously,
the characteristic wavelengths of the spectra are found from 200 to
350 nm, where the useful electronic transitions are π →
π* for compounds with conjugated double bonds and some n → π* and n → σ*
transitions, with several common peaks in the wavelengths of 285 and
325 nm. However, the maximum absorption for each spectrum is slightly
different. Especially, samples obtained from XSBN and GX have the
strongest absorption at about 207 nm, probably indicating the presence
of steroid saponins in P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis, while others present the strong
absorption band at around 225 nm. Additionally, for the mean UV spectra,
it may be appreciated that they display some differences in the whole
absorption intensities that the peak heights of spectra change from
samples to samples according to the collection regions. The lowest
absorption of the spectrum is found in the samples collected from
GBH, whereas the relatively higher one belongs to the samples that
originated from Yunnan Province. In general, when the chemical component
was in high concentration, the corresponding absorption intensity
increased as well. It implied that the various geographical locations
may have an influence on the content of chemical components in methanol
extracts of the rhizome of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis.

WS, Wenshan; XSBN, Xishuangbanna; GBG, Guanteng; GBH, Hezhang; GA,
Anshun; GX, Xingyi.

On the other hand, by
careful examination of the mean original
FTIR spectra (Figure 1B), it is worth noting that the spectral profiles present a similar
shape with each other based on visual inspection, suggesting a homogeneous
chemical constitution among the rhizome samples, despite the fact
that their geographical origins were different. From the overall view
of spectra, it shows a typical major broad peak at around 3384 cm–1 for the stretching vibration of −OH.27 The backbone at about 2931 cm–1 corresponds to the C–H stretching vibration of −CH2, which is revealed in all of the spectra. Furthermore, although
it is difficult to identify the molecular source of unique chemical
information characteristics in mid-infrared spectra of medicinal plants
unambiguously, the following absorption peaks in the region of 1800–400
cm–1, which contains a large number of bands and
is rich in structural information, may display spectral informative
features in various compounds. The strong absorption peaks around
1639 cm–1 are mainly attributed to C=O stretching
vibration of steroid saponins.3,28 Absorbance at approximately
1409 cm–1 may be due to the presence of plane deviational
vibration of −CH2, while peaks that appear at 1243
cm–1 are likely to suggest the C–H deviational
vibrations and C–OH stretching vibration in the benzene ring.
In addition, the region from 1200 to 900 cm–1 is
probably to be identified as the content of the skeletal vibration
of saponins and other glycosides, which have many intensive peaks
at around 1155, 1074, 1045, and 1022 cm–1.29,30 Moreover, some small but obvious peaks in the range of 900–400
cm–1 may indicate the existence of starch, especially
the peaks at around 860, 765, and 582 cm–1. Totally,
it could be inferred that saponins, some starch, and carbohydrates
may be the main chemical composition in P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis, which was also proved by previous
publications.20,26 Although 18 common absorption
peaks of the average FTIR spectra of each group sample have been observed
and a few significant visible differences among the spectral shapes
and peak positions could be presented, there was still some variation
among the samples because several diversities of the absorption intensities
appeared at a number of characteristic peaks, indicating that the
chemical property in the rhizome of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis may be affected by the geographical
origins, which was similar to the initial analysis of UV spectra in
this study.

2.2 Confirmation of the Appropriate
PLS-DA Model
Since the changes along the full UV and FTIR
spectra were comparatively
small, it was not possible to investigate the P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis samples with different geographical
origins accurately through simple visual inspection, making it necessary
to utilize some chemometric methods. To make sure whether the collection
regions could influence the chemical property of the rhizome of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis,
PLS-DA was used to establish the classification models of samples.
Three types of models in terms of typical and nontypical natural habitats,
different collection regions of typical natural habitats, and various
sampling sites in nontypical natural habitats were constructed.

For the single UV and FTIR spectra, the selection of the number of
latent variables (LVs) for each model is shown in Figure 2, and the accuracy of training
and test sets for the classification models based on these LVs is
presented in Table 1. As can be seen in this table, the model performance of FTIR spectra
is better than that of UV spectral information because the former
has higher accuracy not only in the training set but also in the test
set. Besides, to obtain significant information of the spectra related
to the separation of samples, variable importance in projection (VIP)
scores were used. The spectral information with VIP scores greater
than 1 would be considered to be significantly contributive to the
developed PLS-DA model, whereas the variables with VIP scores smaller
than 1 are less important for this model. As shown in Figure 3 as well as Tables S1 and S2, the VIP scores of each model according to
UV and FTIR spectra could be presented. It shows that individual experimental
variables are identified as more significant for the discrimination
of typical and nontypical natural habitats of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis samples belonging to two main
wavebands of UV spectra, including 207–280 nm and 306–324
nm (Figure 3A and Table S1A). For the differentiation of collection
areas in typical natural habitats, UV spectral information of the
waveband in the range of 207–265 nm and 320–376 nm is
considered to be particularly crucial, while for the classification
of sampling sites of nontypical natural habitats, the variables from
207 to 272 nm and from 319 to 393 nm display distinguishable peaks
(Figure 3B,C and Table S1B,C). In a word, the most relevant UV
wavelengths for the distinction of rhizome samples that originated
from different localities are in the spectral region of 207–265
nm, which could be roughly in accordance with the presence of dioscin
(210 nm), paris saponins VII (239 nm), and paritrisides C and D (243,
250, and 260 nm) in P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis.3,29 In other words, it was possible
to estimate that the differences among rhizomes of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis samples
with different geographical regions may be in connection with some
chemical components such as steroid saponins and triterpenes. For
the three models on the basis of FTIR, the wavenumbers in the range
of 1750 to 1000 cm–1 are responsible for each discrimination,
which may suggest the existence of some steroid saponins.3,28,29 Similar to the results of UV
spectra analysis, it demonstrated that the diversity of rhizome of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis samples
obtained from different regions may be related to the distinction
of a number of steroid saponins. On the whole, combining the results
mentioned above, it seemed to imply that the variation of the rhizome
of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis samples with different geographical origins may be primarily due
to the diversity of steroid saponins, which agreed with the previous
study.26

methods.

Despite the fact that the classification models of
the two spectral
methods could show some differences among samples, the model performance
was still unsatisfactory because most of the accuracy was lower than
90%. In particular, the accuracy of the discrimination of collection
areas in typical natural habitats based on UV spectra was the lowest,
which was just 44.44%. It was difficult to distinguish all the samples
precisely just using the individual spectroscopy technique. Nevertheless,
when we combined the UV and FTIR spectral information, obvious improvement
of the model performance could be presented based on the feature-level
fusion with the selected LVs (Figure 2 and Table 1). The feature important variables from single data sources
including UV and FTIR spectra were extracted and coalesced, which
can obtain more deep and comprehensive description than the single
source achieved. All the accuracy is more than 93% except that of
the test set of the second model with the value of 83.72%, which is
also the lowest of all the accuracy. Even so, the lowest accuracy
is much higher than those of the same models in terms of the single
spectral techniques as well as the data-level fusion. Therefore, the
classification models based on feature-level fusion were used to investigate
the P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis samples.

2.3 Differentiation of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis Obtained
from Typical and Nontypical
Natural Habitats
When studying the classification of the
rhizome of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis samples collected from typical and nontypical
natural habitats, the first two LVs were chosen according to the lowest
root-mean-square error of cross-validation (RMSECV) to establish the
PLS-DA model (Figure 2A) based on feature-level fusion. In this case, 94.21% of samples
in the training set are correctly classified, and the accuracy of
test set is 93.55%, as shown in Table 1. It demonstrated that most of the rhizome samples
could be discriminated as the typical and nontypical natural habitats.
Additionally, as is evident in Table 2, all of the average values of sensitivity, specificity,
and efficiency are more than 92.44%, indicating relatively good classification
performance of the samples. The response permutation test revealed
no overfitting with the R2Y-intercept of 0.02 and Q2-intercept of
−0.21. Besides, more visual information could be presented
in the two-dimensional score plot of the first two LVs (Figure 4A), which shows a good separation
trend of the two group samples. To gain the similarities among samples
and verify the results of PLS-DA, HCA was constructed on the basis
of the optimal LVs obtained by PLS-DA. The dendrogram displayed in Figure 4B provides a very
simple two-dimensional plot of the data structure indicating the merging
objects and distances. It is obvious that all the samples are clustering
into two main classes related to typical and nontypical natural habitats.
One class consists of 90% of the samples collected from typical natural
habitats and one sample obtained from nontypical natural habitats,
whereas the other class contains almost all of the samples of the
nontypical natural habitats and the remaining samples of typical natural
habitats, suggesting some diversities between samples from these two
habitats, and the individual dissimilarities of the samples originated
from typical natural habitats were more than those of the samples
collected from the other habitats comparatively, which were roughly
in agreement with the results obtained by PLS-DA. In short, according
to the two chemometric methods, it could be concluded that the chemical
properties of the rhizome of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis were somewhat different in typical
and nontypical natural habitats.

2.4 Discrimination of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis with
Different Collection Regions
in Typical Natural Habitats
With respect to the differentiation
among rhizomes of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis samples collected from four geographical regions
of typical natural habitats, the PLS-DA model was carried out to investigate
significant differences among the tested groups of samples with three
LVs. The four classes, NJ, DZ, WS, and XSBN, present comparably satisfactory
discrimination results with 93.41% accuracy for the training set and
83.72% accuracy for the test set, as can be seen in Table 1. In addition, this classification
model exhibits good sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency for the
training set with the average value of 94.32, 93.95, and 94.10%, respectively
(Table 3). For the
test set, the average sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency are
more than 84.31%, which are also acceptable for the model. R2-intercept and Q2-intercept values presented goodness of fit of the established model.
These results indicated that the PLS-DA method was able to efficiently
model the rhizome of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis with different geographical locations of typical
natural habitats, which also implied that the collection areas could
influence the chemical properties of samples. Moreover, as shown in
the score plot of LV 1 and LV 2 (Figure 5A), it is initially found that the three
collection regions of typical natural habitats, named NJ, CY, and
XSBN, have displayed good separation with each other, suggesting obvious
distinction and regional dependence among the samples originated from
these three areas. Additionally, most of the samples obtained from
the WS region are mixed with those of the NJ areas, and both LV 1
and LV 2 are determined mainly by positive scores for these samples
as well as samples from the remaining two areas distributed in other
three quadrants, indicating that samples from the first two regions
may be similar with each other. Besides, samples collected from CY,
which mainly get together in the left side of the score plot, may
have distinct differences with other samples that almost group together
at the right side.

A similar discrimination pattern is observed in the
HCA dendrogram
of the rhizome samples (Figure 5B). Overall, apart from 10 samples, other samples are grouped
together as their geographical origins, and clustering of samples
in the same group means a large similarity on their chemical constituents.
In addition, samples of NJ and WS can be recognized to have relatively
closer relationships because they can cluster into the same branch
at first. For the samples originated from CY, they are classified
into one subfraction and reveal a difference compared with others,
which is consistent with the results acquired by PLS-DA. Meanwhile,
it also showed that the individual differences of samples were various
based on the collection regions. In Figure 5B, samples from NJ are likely to have the
most obvious individual discrepancies because 16.2% of these samples
cluster into another group. Subsequently, samples with the geographical
origin of CY also have some individual diversities due to the fact
that 5.6% of these samples get together with another class. The least
individual differences are exhibited in samples obtained in XSBN,
and all of them group into the same branch, which also indicated better
quality consistency. From the consequence mentioned in Section 2.3, great individual differences could be presented among samples from
the typical natural habitats. However, in this section, an interesting
finding implied that not all of the samples collected from typical
natural habitats had remarkable individual dissimilarities and it
may further depend on the small regions of the collection. Consequently,
according to the results in this section, collection regions in the
typical natural habitats could affect the chemical properties of the
rhizome of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis, and the individual discrepancies in the samples
may be decided by different areas.

2.5 Comparison
of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis Collected from Different Sampling
Sites of Nontypical Natural Habitats
Apart from the typical
natural habitats, the collection sites of the nontypical natural habitats
may also have impacts on the chemical components of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis samples.
Similarly, the fusion matrix was carried out by PLS-DA for establishing
the discrimination model of the rhizome samples. In fact, the first
four LVs were used, and the detailed parameters are shown in Table 4. With regard to the
training and test sets, all the values of sensitivity, specificity,
and efficiency are 100%, suggesting perfect performance of the classification
model without any false prediction. In other words, the rhizome of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis samples
could be exactly discriminated by the geographical origins of nontypical
natural habitats. In addition, the two-dimensional plot using LV 1
and LV 2 is shown in Figure 6A. In general, the distribution trends could interpret the
relationships among studied rhizome samples. First, individual samples
belonging to the same collection site are grouped together, and the
four classes are distinguished in accordance with their origins, indicating
the differences of the chemical constituents of these samples. Likewise,
the regional dependence may occur in these samples. However, samples
from GBG and GBH are distributed closely, and LV 2 is determined mainly
by the strong positive scores for these samples, while the negative
scores on LV 2 are found for samples belonging to the region of GA
and GX, which implied the similarity of the chemical properties of
the samples collected from the first two areas. For the dendrogram
of HCA displayed in Figure 6B, it reveals that all the samples could cluster as their
collection sites, and GBG as well as GBH classes could be readily
discriminated from the other samples, which also verify the results
of PLS-DA stating that different geographical origins could be one
of the factors that affect the chemical profiles of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis in
nontypical natural habitats. Furthermore, on the other hand, it also
demonstrated that a few individual differences of the tested samples
from all the four regions in nontypical natural habitats could be
presented, which may be inferred that the quality of individuals in
each location was relatively consistent.

Raw material examination is a critical process in
the industrial
production of pharmaceuticals. According to previous studies, there
were some analytical techniques used to investigate P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis including
UV, NIR, FTIR, HPLC, UPLC-MS, etc.26,31−34 In the present study, multispectral information fusion in conjunction
with chemometrics was proved to be a potential tool to rapidly and
comprehensively compare and evaluate different properties of wild P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis that
originated from eight collection regions. This method contained more
chemical information than that of a single technique and may offer
a new insight into the geoherbalism differentiation of this species
of medicinal plant. In total, the typical and nontypical natural habitats
as well as the different situated areas in the same habitats could
play important roles in the influence on the chemical properties of
samples. Additionally, both the regional dependency and individual
differences among samples relied on the geographical origins. Considering
the fact that the sampling locations are far related regions, such
different geographical conditions could be existent.

For the
typical natural habitat, Yunnan Province is the main part
of the low-latitude plateau in China, which is influenced by the complicated
three-dimensional climate with the long total sun exposure time, strong
UV light, relatively stable average year temperature, the considerable
intraday temperature variation, and obvious alternating dry and rainy
seasons.35P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis that is native to this province
has relatively better quality, and it is one of the geoherbs in Yunnan
Province. However, the nontypical natural habitat, which is Guizhou
Province, is characterized by subtropical plateau monsoon climate
based on lower average altitude and total sun exposure time as well
as unstable average year temperature than those of Yunnan Province.36 By the way, abundant annual precipitation is
also present in Guizhou Province. During the progress of growth, the
changes of higher plants are a result of the interaction between plants
and biotic and abiotic environments.37 As
reported by Ren et al.,38 the accumulation
of bioactive products in rhubarb was impacted by the geographic distribution
and soil components. In addition, Zheng et al.39 demonstrated that the accumulation of flavonol glycosides
in Hippophae rhamnoides ssp. rhamnoides berries was associated negatively with the sum
of the daily mean temperatures from the start of growth season until
the day of harvest. Sometimes, the chemical properties of medicinal
plants are almost connected with the synergy of a variety of environmental
factors, and their relationships were complex.40 So, for the results of our study, the differences among
samples from typical and nontypical natural habitats may be related
to environmental factors, such as light quality, sun exposure time,
temperature, and rainfall. Besides, the individual dissimilarities
of samples obtained from typical natural habitats were more than others,
which may be due to the relatively more complicated environment in
Yunnan Province.

On the
other hand, although there were some samples collected from
the typical natural habitats, obvious differences were also exhibited.
From the results, samples with the geographical origin of Xishuangbanna,
located in the south part of Yunnan Province, were somewhat special
because of their least individual differences and relative better
quality consistency. According to previous studies, Zhao et al.32 showed that the content of polyphyllin I and
total steroid saponins in P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis obtained from southwestern Yunnan
was the highest in all the samples. Moreover, the content of some
chemical compounds of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis from different regions in Yunnan
Province was diverse, and the quality of the tested samples from south
Yunnan was better than those from the central area, as reported by
Yang et al.26 These findings were similar
to our study and may sustain the special phenomenon in this work.
Comparing the environmental condition of this region to others in
Yunnan Province, the rainfall in Xishuangbanna is relatively much
more than that in Nujiang, Central Yunnan, and Wenshan regions. More
interestingly, samples from nontypical natural habitats with great
rainfall also had consistent qualities in each collection site. Hence,
it could be inferred that precipitation may be one of the dominant
factors for the quality consistency of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis. Meanwhile, from the perspective
of quality consistency, Xishuangbanna of Yunnan Province as one of
the typical natural habitats of wild P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis may be the relative suitable growth
area for this species. Nevertheless, it is difficult to speculate
which site in nontypical natural habitats is the best. Furthermore,
since time immemorial, people have gathered plant resources for their
demands, and medicinal plants play an important role in both traditional
medicines used and trade commodities in many countries.1 In recent years, the demand for a wide variety
of wild medicinal plants is increasing with growth in human needs,
numbers, and commercial trade, which give rise to some wild species
being overexploited, and some of them are recommended to be brought
into artificial cultivation systems to avoid further loss of endangered
species and to give a continuous and uniform supply of medicinal plants.41 The raw material selection and growth locations
are crucial for the final cultivated plants. In this study, with respect
to P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis, samples collected from Xishuangbanna could be considered to be
the better raw material with consistent quality for artificial cultivation
of this species. However, further studies are needed to investigate
the reliability and reason for this phenomenon.

3 Conclusions
In the present paper, the use of multispectral
information fusion
combined with chemometric methods was investigated to condense the
information brought by UV and FTIR spectroscopies for the geoherbalism
differentiation of wild P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis raw materials. In conclusion,
the variation of this species was correlated with their geographical
origins, not only the typical and nontypical natural habitats but
also the different situated locations in the same habitats. Meanwhile,
the degree of regional dependence and individual discrepancy also
relied on the collection regions. In addition, Xishuangbanna of Yunnan
Province as one of the typical natural habitats of wild P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis was
recommended as the relative suitable growth area for this species
with better quality consistency. Totally, it may contribute to a more
entire complement of current studies on the development and utilization
of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 P. polyphylla
var. yunnanensis Samples and
Reagents
A total of 183 wild fresh P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis samples were obtained from eight
distinct regions (16 collection sites) in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces
of China, including Nujiang (NJ), Central Yunnan (CY), Wenshan (WS),
Xishuangbanna (XSBN), Guanteng (GBG), Hezhang (GBH), Anshun (GA),
and Xingyi (GX). Among them, the first four regions belonging to Yunnan
Province are the typical habitats of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis, while the other four areas of
Guizhou Province are nontypical natural habitats of this species.
The botanical origins were identified by Jinyu Zhang from Yunnan Academy
of Agricultural Sciences, and voucher specimens of all samples collected
were stored at the Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of
Agricultural Sciences. Detailed sample information is specified in Table 5 and Figure 7. After collection, the fresh
materials were washed clean immediately, the rhizome of each sample
was cut into small pieces, and then they were dried in the shade.
Afterward, the dried rhizome samples were ground into fine powder,
passed through a 100-mesh stainless steel sieve, and kept in new labeled
Ziploc bags at room temperature prior to use. For the reagents, methanol
of analytical grade purchased from Xilong Chemical Company, Ltd. (China),
and potassium bromide (KBr) of spectroscopic grade were used in this
study.

4.2 UV Spectroscopic Analysis
Accurately
weighed rhizome powders (0.05 g) were extracted by an ultrasonic extraction
apparatus for 30 min at 55 kHz with 5.0 mL of methanol. Then, the
extracted solution was adjusted to the initial weight by adding methanol
as needed and filtered with analytical filter paper. After that, the
filtrates were used as sample solution for final UV qualitative analysis.
The spectra of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis samples were immediately acquired using a UV-2550
UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) equipped
with two quartz cells with an optical path of 1 cm. One cell was used
for the extracts of samples, and the other one was for methanol. In
addition, UV spectral analysis was carried out in the working range
from 200 to 400 nm with a sampling interval of 1.0 nm, and the blank
spectrum was scanned with methanol. Before each measurement, baseline
correction was also conducted. Each UV spectrum was recorded in triplicate,
and all further data analyses were performed based on the average
spectrum of each triplicate. Moreover, the original spectra were pretreated
by the third derivative so as to enlarge the difference among spectra.

4.3 FTIR Spectra Acquisition
The FTIR
spectra of samples were collected through KBr pellets, in which the
ratio of KBr to sample was 100:1.5 (w/w) by using a Frontier FTIR
spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, USA) equipped with a deuterated triglycine
sulfate (DTGS) detector at a resolution of 4 cm–1 with 16 scans in the region of 4000–400 cm–1. Each spectrum with high signal-to-noise signal was recorded by
an average of these 16 scans. All the analyses were carried out under
the condition of constant temperature (25 °C) and humidity (30%).
The sample spectra were obtained by subtracting the background measured
according to pure dried KBr in tablet form with the same parameters
for the sake of removing unwanted absorbance bands of water and carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere. Each sample was scanned with three replicates,
and the average of three spectra obtained from each same sample was
used for subsequent data analyses. In addition, all the raw FTIR spectra
were automatically baseline-corrected and automatically smoothed with
the aid of Spectrum for Windows software (Nicolet OMNIC 9.7.7, Thermo
Fisher Scientific) and also preprocessed by the second derivative
and standard normal variate, which were applied to correct light scatter
and reduce the changes in the light path length as well as remove
the overlapping peaks.

4.4 Statistical Analysis
The preprocessed
individual UV and FTIR spectral information was first subjected to
establish PLS-DA models respectively so as to carry out the investigation
among P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis samples on the basis of the typical and nontypical natural habitats,
various collection regions of typical natural habitats, and different
sampling location in nontypical natural habitats. In general, this
method is a variation of the partial least squares regression algorithm
for discriminant analysis and belongs to the group of the supervised
learning methods, which has initial knowledge of the classes.42,43 It could transform the observed data information into a set of several
intermediate linear LVs that are useful to predict the dependent variables
and demonstrate whether a given sample belongs to a given class.44 The final model is decided by the best number
of LVs selected in terms of the minimum value of RMSECV.45 Prior to the construction of PLS-DA models,
two-thirds of samples from each group were selected by Kennard–Stone
algorithm for the training set, and the remaining samples were used
as the test set. Simultaneously, single spectral information obtained
from UV and FTIR spectroscopies were directly grouped into a new dataset
to form the data-level fusion matrix. In addition, the scores from
individual UV and FTIR spectral information were joined together for the feature-level fusion data block. These two fusion data matrices
were also used to build PLS-DA models, which were compared with those
of single UV and FTIR spectra via the accuracy of training and tests
as well. After that, the appropriate models were confirmed to discuss
the differences among samples. The validation of the model was conducted
by using 7-fold cross-validation and permutation tests (n = 200). In addition, the performance of the selected models was
further evaluated with respect to some statistical parameters including
false positive rate, false negative rate, sensitivity, specificity,
efficiency, the root mean square error of estimation (RMSEE), RMSECV, R2-intercept, and Q2-intercept. The false positive rate and false negative rate, which
represent the incorrectly identified samples of positive and negative
class, respectively, could express the trueness in qualitative analysis
while sensitivity and specificity, which represent the model ability
to classify samples, are related to the selectivity of the method.46 The efficiency, which presents the geometric
mean of the specificity and sensitivity, could summarize these two
parameters of model performance, and the index values of efficiency
vary between 0 and 100%.47 For the lowest
RMSECV, it could guarantee the LVs collected as much as possible,
and they are not overfitted.48 Besides,
if the intercept of R2 was below 0.4 and
that of Q2 was below −0.05 in the
permutation test, then the built PLS-DA model was considered as an
appropriate model without overfitting.49 Moreover, HCA, which was intended to create groups that maximize
the cohesion internally and maximize separation externally, was eventually
employed to explain the degree of similarities among different classes
of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis samples by using Ward’s clustering algorithm. In this study,
PLS-DA and HCA were performed by SIMCA-P+ 13.0 (Umetrics,
Umeå, Sweden) and R statistical analysis program (version 3.4.1;
R Development Core Team), respectively.
