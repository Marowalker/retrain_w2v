The present study reports a facile
and low-cost route to produce
a superhydrophobic polymerized n-octadecylsilane
surface with micronano hierarchical structure on the surface of quartz
crystal microbalance (QCM). The surface is used as a novel functional
sensing material to detect benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene
(BTEX) vapor on the basis of QCM platform. The composites were characterized
by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
and contact angle measurements. The type of solvent used to dissolve N-octadecyltrichlorosilane has a big impact on the morphology,
wettability, and sensing performance of the polymer material. Further
systematic studies suggest that surface wettability (contact angle)
and molecular polarity of the detected analytes are effective factors
in selective detection toward BTEX using resonator-type gas sensors.
Gas sensing results toward toluene in different relative humidities
show that the new-style sensor has stable toluene/water selective
detection performance and that the disturbance of water is negligible.
Besides, the limit of detection toward toluene of the sensor is lower
than the odor threshold value.

==== Body
Introduction
Industrial and agricultural
developments cause not only production
of new products but also more usage and emission of harmful chemicals
as well as noxious gas.1−6 As it is well known, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have a bad
health effect on mankind.7,8 As typical VOCs, which
would harm human health, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene
(BTEX) are always distributed in the human living environment at low
concentrations.9−12 Thus, several gas sensors, such as semiconductor sensors and quartz
crystal microbalance (QCM) transducers, have been developed to detect
BTEX and avoid or reduce their harmful effects on human health.13−17 QCM is used as a transducer for detecting different gases via coating
various materials.18 Although these BTEX
sensors possess good sensing ability, most of them have not focused
on eliminating the interference of water, which can badly weaken the
selectivity of gas sensors. The BTEX detection performance under different
relative humidities (RHs) is also unstable.

Materials with a
water contact angle of above 150° are usually
called superhydrophobic materials.19 It
is well known that superhydrophobic materials can repel water very
well.20 In recent years, the study of superhydrophobic
materials has been emerging and many materials have been found to
possess superhydrophobic properties, such as poly(vinylidene difluoride)
membranes, cotton fabrics, nickel film, poly(dimethyl siloxane), etc.21−25 To date, these superhydrophobic materials have found many applications
like antifouling function, buoyancy improvement, pipeline modification,
fabric coating, and microfluidic flow control.26−30 Nonetheless, the study of superhydrophobic materials
as QCM-based sensing materials has not been conducted so far.

n-Octadecylsiloxanes (n-ODS)
is a common organic substance, which has been used as a visible photoluminescence
and hydrophobic material.31,32 Meanwhile, polymerized n-octadecylsiloxane (PODS) from hydrolysis and polymerization
of n-ODS has also been greatly explored.33 Currently, PODS is often employed as modified
film to make the surface of some objects superhydrophobic.34 Besides, its composites with other materials,
such as SiO2, possess different superhydrophobic properties
compared to PODS.35 It is notable that
sponges decorated with PODS show excellent oil/water separation performances
between toluene and water, which can only adsorb toluene after being
soaked in toluene/water mixed liquor because of their superhydrophobic
and superoleophilic properties.36 It is
well known that different hydrophobic chemicals can attract each other
and repel water;20 thus, PODS has potential
to detect toluene vapor as a modified sensing material for mass-type
sensors on the basis of its theoretical toluene/water separation performance.
However, there is still no relevant research about PODS as sensing
material so far.

In this work, PODS film has been prepared on
the surface of QCM
substrate for BTEX detection for the first time. For systematic study,
we concentrated our attention to the “sensing factor”
between PODS sensing surface and BTEX, so a series of sensing factors
have been explored comprehensively, including solvents used to dissolve N-octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS), contact angle between
PODS and the test gases, molecular polarity, etc. The distinguishing
individual sensing behavior of target BTEX is attributed to their
characteristic difference in molecule structure. It is discovered
that superhydrophobic PODS surface would support its ability of toluene/water
selective detection. The sensor we designed can detect lower concentrations
of toluene than the odor threshold value (34 ppm).

Results and Discussion
Surface
Morphology and Wettability
SEM images of PODS
treated with air (a), water (b), acetone (c), and ethanol (d) are
shown in Figure 1.
The four FTIR spectra all fit well, indicating that they are the same
chemicals (Figure S2 and Note S3). The
difference in morphology is significant, indicating that the solvent
has an effect on the morphology of PODS. When OTS was treated with
air (Figure 1a), amorphous
surface with islands can be observed. For water (Figure 1b), only block structure was
found. For acetone, crystalline nanosheets can be observed because
of the self-assembly process of hydrolyzed OTS and subsequent polycondensation
process (Figure 1c).
For ethanol (Figure 1d), the morphology of PODS is intestine-like and its crystallinity
is not obvious. Correspondingly, the wettability of PODS surface is
also different, caused by the solvents. As shown in the results of
contact angle test, the contact angles of 1PODS, 2PODS, 3PODS, and
4PODS are 99.7, 136.1, 151.2, and 121.9°, respectively. The contact
angle sequence of the four coating materials is as follows: 1PODS
< 4PODS < 2PODS < 3PODS. It is obvious that all surfaces
are hydrophobic. Notably, the contact angle of 3PODS is larger than
150°, indicating its superhydrophobicity. Therefore, the solvent
of OTS influences both morphology and hydrophobicity of its polymer.
As shown in Scheme 1, the polymerization process of PODS was supported by the previous
report.38 Considering the polymerization
process and crystallization degree, acetone makes the polymerization
process more complete and thus carbon long chains can be well arranged
and exposed to the outside. It is well known that carbon long chain
is hydrophobic, so the PODS has better hydrophobic property when the
solvent is acetone.

Figure 1 SEM images and contact angle test results of (a) 1PODS,
(b) 2PODS,
(c) 3PODS, and (d) 4PODS.

Scheme 1 Polymerization Process of PODS
Effect of Wettability on Sensing Properties
The contact
angles of the four materials (1PODS, 2PODS, 3PODS, and 4PODS) vary
widely. Here, all samples were tested in the same testing environment
(60% RH) to systematically compare the sensing properties toward BTEX
of PODS with different wettabilities. These sensors were allowed to
detect benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and p-xylene
(BTEX) with the same concentration of 400 ppm. Besides, other benzenes
also had been tested for more obvious contrast, including nitrobenzene
and aniline. The test results are listed in Table S2.

The results from Table S2 revealed that whole PODS coating material shows sensing ability
toward six common benzenes. The response of toluene, ethylbenzene,
and p-xylene are larger than that of others. With
the increase of contact angle, the sensor response toward tested vapor
increased. Besides, the response sequence of four coating materials
toward different benzenes is almost as follows: 1PODS < 4PODS <
2PODS < 3PODS. This sequence is consistent with their contact angle
sequence. The result indicates a correlation between the wettability
and BTEX sensing performance of PODS. The response of 3PODS toward
six benzenes is larger than 1PODS, 2PODS, and 4PODS, indicating its
best BTEX affinity. Thus, 3PODS is selected for the further sensor
performance evaluation because of its best sensing ability.

Effect
of Molecular Polarity on Sensing Properties
Molecular polarity
relation of two substances is an important factor
in evaluating their intermiscibility.39 In the case of superhydrophobic surface, weak polar substances may
be adsorbed easily. Xylene has three common isomers, including p-xylene, m-xylene, and o-xylene.40 Due to different position of
the methyl, polarities of the three xylene isomers are also different.
It is well known that the polarity sequence of xylene isomers is as
follows: o-xylene > m-xylene
> p-xylene. Here, we use 3PODS-modified QCM to
detect three
xylene isomers with various concentrations.

For all xylene isomers,
it was observed from Figure 2 that all of the responses increased when the concentration
of xylene increased as expected. Notably, the response toward p-xylene is the highest compared to the other two isomers
in any tested concentration. The response sequence of the three xylene
isomers is as follows: o-xylene < m-xylene < p-xylene. This sequence is the opposite
of the sequence of molecular polarity. The results imply that chemicals
with weak polarity can be easily adsorbed on a superhydrophobic surface
instead of chemicals with high polarity.

Figure 2 Response of 3PODS toward
three kinds of xylene isomers with different
concentrations.

Sensing Performance of
Toluene/Water Selectively Detecting
In the actual detecting
process, the interference caused by water
molecules in air is inevitable. Thus, toluene under 95% RH was designed
to evaluate the humidity resistance property of the sensor. Figure 3 shows the response
of PODS-modified QCM sensor toward 400 ppm toluene under 95% RH. For
comparison, toluene with 400 ppm concentration under default environment
(65% RH) was also studied. For all kinds of PODS, the improvement
of response toward 400 ppm toluene under 95% RH rarely increased compared
to 400 ppm toluene under default environment. Especially, the response
of 3PODS toward 400 ppm toluene keeps well in different RH environments.
Besides, the response of 3PODS is larger than others, and these two
merits of 3PODS should be attributed to better hydrophobicity than
1PODS, 2PODS, and 4PODS.

Figure 3 Response of four kinds of PODS toward toluene
under default and
high humidity.

Figure 4 shows the
dynamic response–recovery curves of the 3PODS-modified QCM
sensor to toluene with the concentration ranging from 100 to 400 ppm
at ambient temperature under default 60% RH. As toluenes with continuous
increase of concentrations were injected into the chamber, the response
increased. Besides, compared to the response of 400 ppm toluene, the
response toward 400 ppm toluene under different RHs of 20, 40, 80,
and 90% is almost unchanged. This experimental result further indicates
its superior toluene/water selective detection performance. The baseline
was well reestablished after the toluene was washed off by N2 stream, indicating its ideal reversibility. The response time and
recovery time of 3PODS-based QCM sensor to 20 ppm toluene are shown
in the inset of Figure 4. It can be observed that the response time and recovery time of
3PODS-modified QCM sensor were 10 and 9 s, respectively. It is obvious
that this sensor is sensitive to 20 ppm toluene, which is lower than
the odor threshold value (34 ppm), indicating its practical application
potential. To further explore the waterproof toluene detection of
3PODS, we evacuated the sensing test chamber to make it completely
dry. Then, pure toluene and mixtures of toluene and water with different
concentrations were introduced in the vacuum test chamber. As shown
in Figure 5, the response
of 3PODS-based sensor toward 20 ppm toluene mixed with water is very
close to that of the pure 20 ppm toluene. For 30 and 40 ppm concentrations
of toluene, the results are also consistent, indicating the waterproof
property of 3PODS.

RH environments.
The inset shows the response curve of 3PODS toward 20 ppm toluene.

Figure 5 Response of 3PODS toward mixtures of toluene
and water with different
concentrations.

The good reversible performance
of 3PODS-based sensor should be
attributed to its adsorption mode, which is closely relative to the
enthalpy change of the sensing material and target molecule. Herein,
QCM platform was used to perform temperature-varying experiments for
extracting isotherms and enthalpy change. The test method refers to
a previous report.37 Two isotherms of 3PODS
toward various toluene concentrations (100, 200, and 400 ppm) at different
temperatures (298 and 313 K) should be obtained for calculating enthalpy
change value (ΔH) using the Clausius–Clapeyron
equation. As shown in Figure 6a,b, two real-time toluene-sensing curves are recorded, which
can obtain the corresponding linear plots. As shown in Figure 6c, on the basis of the Clausius–Clapeyron
equation, the value of ΔH is calculated to
be −46.076 kJ mol–1, and the value is moderate
between physical adsorption and chemical adsorption. The ΔH value indicates a hydrophilic–hydrophobic interaction
between toluene molecule and 3PODS with exothermic property. Considering
the adsorption/desorption equilibrium from sensing test and the moderate
ΔH value comprehensively, it can be concluded
that the adsorption mode between PODS and toluene is reversible chemical
adsorption.41 This adsorption process should
be attributed to the “like-dissolves-like” mechanism.
Considering the influence of temperature on response ability, the
response of the gas sensor based on 3PODS toward 100 ppm toluene is
shown in Figure 7,
which was tested at different temperatures ranging from 283 to 313
K. The sensor can detect toluene at all tested temperatures. The response
of the sensor decreased with increasing temperature. The result should
be attributed to exothermic property during the adsorption process
between PODS surface and the toluene molecule.

Figure 6 Sensing curves of 3PODS
at 298 K (a) and 313 K (b) to toluene with
different concentrations (100, 200, and 400 ppm). On the basis of
the temperature-varied microgravimetric curves, plotted isotherms
are used to extract the value of ΔH. (c) On
the basis of the experimental results of 3PODS in (a) and (b), two
isotherms are plotted to calculate the value of ΔH.

Figure 7 Response (hertz) of 3PODS toward 100 ppm toluene
at different temperatures.

For all sensors, stability is very important.42 Superhydrophobic PODS surface avoids being dirty
from hydrophilic
pollutants, so 3PODS-modified QCM sensors exposed to the air possess
excellent stability theoretically. As shown in Figure 8a, the responses of 4 sensors to 400 ppm
toluene were repeated for a month with 16 tests. Before each test,
the sensors were cleaned with deionized water and dried at 60 °C
to remove adsorbed water molecules. All of the responses showed slight
decrease after continuous tests for 31 days, indicating that all of
these sensors had good stability. It should be attributed to the self-cleaning
ability of the hydrophobic material.43 As
shown in Figure 8b,
impurities adhered to the surface of hydrophobic PODS can be washed
with deionized water. Figure S3 shows the
SEM image of 3PODS (31st day), which is consistent with Figure 1c, indicating its structural
stability.

toluene. (b) The reason for long-term stability.

Selectivity, another important property of a gas sensor,
was also
investigated. In Figure 9, the contrastive responses of 3PODS are listed upon exposure to
four BTEX vapors (400 ppm) and other nine kinds of vapors (400 ppm),
including acetone, methane, chloroform, formaldehyde, carbon dioxide,
nitrogen dioxide, nitric oxide, ethanol, and water. It is obvious
that 3PODS-based QCM sensor possesses a suitable selective detection
capacity toward BTEX vapors, such as toluene, p-xylene,
ethylbenzene, and benzene. These nine kinds of contrastive gases are
common in air and living environment, so 3PODS-based QCM sensor has
practical application potential for living BTEX detection.

Figure 9 Responses of
3PODS-based sensor to various kinds of interfering
gases compared to BTEX. The concentration of all gases is 400 ppm.

Conclusions
Superhydrophobic
PODS surface has been facilely obtained via a
one-step preparation. The method is less expensive and applicable
to modify QCM electrode for the first time. Accordingly, various gas-sensing
tests toward BTEX show that PODS-modified QCM sensor has stable responses
to toluene in water-containing environment. Solvent of OTS, contact
angle of PODS, and molecular polarity of analytes all affect sensing
performance. Potential application of this sensor to toluene detection
is anticipated because of its exceptional waterproof property, long-term
stability, outstanding selectivity, and satisfying detection limit
lower than the odor threshold value.

Experimental Section
Materials
N-Octadecyltrichlorosilane
(OTS) (95%) was purchased from Acros. Acetone was purchased from Shanghai
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). QCM resonators with
silver electrode were purchased from Chengdu West Sensor Co., Ltd.,
China, and were used as substrates. The fundamental frequency of these
QCM resonators is 107 Hz (AT-cut). QCM resonators were
rinsed with ethanol for 10 min and dried with N2 before
being coated with PODS.

Preparation of Modified QCM Sensors
PODS was prepared
according to a modified method from a previous work.34 All QCMs were cleaned with absolute alcohol before use
and then taken out and coated with 1 μL OTS. Subsequently, the
OTS-coated QCMs were immersed in different solvents (air, water, acetone,
and ethanol) for several seconds, dried under room conditions (relative
humidity, 65%; temperature, 25 °C), and cured in an oven at 40
°C for 8 h. The PODS films deposited on the QCM substrate using
different solvents (air, water, acetone, and ethanol) were named 1PODS,
2PODS, 3PODS, and 4PODS, respectively. The sensors information is
presented in Table S1 (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information).
