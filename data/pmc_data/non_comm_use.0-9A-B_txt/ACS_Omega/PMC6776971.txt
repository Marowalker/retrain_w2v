With
the development of multifunctional imaging, gadolinium (Gd)-bearing
inorganic nanoparticles (NPs), which were doped with trivalent lanthanide
(Ln3+), have been applied in magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) and optical imaging owing to their high payload of Gd3+ ions and specific optical characteristics. In this study, we chose
GdVO4 codoped with Eu3+ and Bi3+ as
the host material to generate a highly efficient contrast agent (CA)
for MRI and long-term luminescence imaging. The new CA emits strong
and stable luminescence because of its strong characteristic emissions,
resulting from the energy-transfer process from the vanadate groups
(VO43–) to the Eu3+ and Bi3+ dopants. Additionally, these NPs provided conspicuous T1 and T2 relaxation
time-shortening characteristics, which result in MRI enhancement.
GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NPs were tested on
liver tumor-bearing nude mice, and showed improved liver tumor contrast
in T2-weighted MR images (T2WI). The dual-modal imaging probe exhibited no cytotoxicity
or organ toxicity, reflecting its excellent biocompatibility. Thus,
GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ has the potential
to be used for bioassays in vitro and liver tumor
targeting in vivo. The results reveal the great promise
of using the designed GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NPs as luminescent and MRI dual-mode bioprobes for clinical
bioimaging applications.

1 Introduction
Molecular imaging has
been applied in the development of precision
medicine, where it has improved the accuracy of clinical diagnoses
and treatments.1−4 Contrast agents (CAs) composed of nanomaterials and organic materials
are extensively applied to molecular imaging.5−8 Using magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) to diagnose liver tumors is a good clinical choice.9,10 Compared to routine MRI, current clinical MRI techniques for
detecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) achieve higher mean sensitivity
and specificity (89.7% and 92%, respectively, compared with 84.9%
and 89.7% for routine MRI) with standard small-molecule Gd chelates.11 The optical imaging technique has significant
advantages, such as excellent sensitivity, high resolution, contrast,
instrument portability, and low cytotoxicity.5 Moreover, multimodal imaging probes can provide more precise information
for disease diagnosis and can be used to shuttle drugs into tumor
tissue.12

Most of the available reports
on different rare earth (RE) orthovanadate
nanomaterials have focused on the YVO4 and LaVO4 platforms.13−16 Because of the lackness of significant magnetic characteristics,
the nanophosphors have been used only for biomedical applications,
but they have not been used as MRI CAs.16 Actually, gadolinium vanadate (GdVO4) is an essential
host matrix, which is widely used in near-infrared (NIR) light and
activated RE oxide phosphors.17,18 However, concerns have
recently been raised about brain deposition of the small-molecule
Gd chelates currently used in clinical practice.19,20 Compared with commercial small-molecule Gd chelate complexes, Gd-based
inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) incorporate Gd3+ ions into
a solid structure rather than into organic molecules, effectively
avoiding the possibility of dissociation and the consequent leakage
of Gd3+ while minimizing related toxicity and increasing
the proton relaxivity.21 A series of inorganic
Gd-based compounds have been used for MRI contrast enhancement, including
gadolinium oxides (Gd2O3),22,23 gadolinium fluorides (GdF3, NaGdF4),24−26 gadolinium hydroxides (Gd(OH)3),27 and gadolinium oxysalts (GdVO4, GdPO4).28−30 Furthermore, in multifunctional imaging fields, these NPs are promising
vehicles for carrying luminescence-imaging cations, especially trivalent
lanthanide ions (Ln3+). Notably, some of these new MRI
CAs demonstrate both T1 and T2 relaxation time-shortening effects, and Gd-based NPs
have a high r2/r1 ratio, with dominant T2 signal
enhancement.31 GdVO4 NPs have
strong potential for multimodal MRI and luminescence imaging.

RE-based luminescent NPs, consisting of a host material which is
doped with Ln ions, lack fluorescence scintillation, have excellent
photostability, long lives, low cytotoxicity, and extraordinary narrow
emission lines.32 Gadolinium orthovanadate
(GdVO4)-based NPs can be doped with RE ions for luminescent
displays because of their equal valences and similar ionic radii.
When GdVO4 is used as a host material, the [VO4]3– groups strongly absorb UV light. In addition,
trivalent europium (Eu3+) ion-doped materials, with excellent
red luminescence resulting from the 5D0 to 7F2 (620 nm) electric dipole emission transition
in the visible light range, are highly suitable photoluminescent probes
because of the long photoluminescence (PL) lifetime of Eu3+.33 However, the red emission of Eu3+ is primarily produced via downshifting luminescence (DSL)
processes, which depend on excitation by UV radiation with short wavelengths
(normally <300 nm), which limits the applications of such materials
for bioimaging.34,35 Bi3+ (bismuth) sensitizers
improve the luminescence properties by shifting the excitation peak
toward longer wavelengths.36 In addition,
Bi3+ functions as an activator when incorporated into the
[VO4]3– host material. With the 6s2 electronic configuration, Bi3+ ions doped into
REVO4 materials doped with Bi3+ ions host active
electrons that are first transferred from Bi3+ to the V5+ 3d0 configuration and then to Eu3+.37,38

Here, we present GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NPs in which europium (Eu3+)
and bismuth (Bi3+) are codoped into GdVO4 NPs
for detection with MRI and
DSL bioimaging. The purpose of this study was to determine both the in vitro and in vivo bimodal imaging characteristics
of this new CA.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Structural Data
Figure 1a–c represents
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs of the GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NPs. The low-magnification
TEM images (Figure 1a,b) displayed that the NPs exhibit an oval shape with a uniform
size and are uniformly dispersed. The length of each particle is approximately
20–30 nm, and the width is approximately 10 nm. The structure
of an individual NP that exhibits well-defined lattice fringes was
depicted via high-magnification TEM micrograph (Figure 1c).

TEM
micrograph of the NPs, scale bar = 5 nm. (d) EDS exhibiting the NPs
elementary composition of the NPs.

The purity of the NPs was investigated using energy-dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS). Figure 1d presents an EDS spectrum of the sample. This result shows
that the sample contains the elements of Gd, Bi, Eu, vanadium (V),
and oxygen (O) (in Figure 1d, the elemental mapping image is shown in the small red box
on the bottom-left of the inset), while the carbon (C) and copper
(Cu) peaks emanate from the TEM carbon-coated copper grid. These EDS
measurements demonstrate the successful incorporation of a high content
of Eu3+ and Bi3+ ions into the nanocrystals.

Figure 2a is a graphic
of the GdVO4 crystal structure and the coordination mode
for the tetragonal structure in which the Gd3+ and O2– ions tetrahedrally coordinate with the V5+ cations in the spaces among the isolated VO4 tetrahedral
units. Therefore, Gd3+ ions and the surrounding eight O2– ions create a distorted GdO8 dodecahedron.
VO4 tetrahedra and GdO8 dodecahedra alternate
and share edges, with Gd3+ and V5+ ions in a
direct line that is parallel to the c-axis.39,40

In Figure 2c, the
selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern displays a bright
diffraction rosette are due to the (200), (220), and (400) crystal
phases. Therefore, the NPs showed high crystallinity, forming a typical
and pure tetragonal phase. In addition, in Figure 2d, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of
the GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ consisting of
peaks that follow the normal pattern of GdVO4 (JCPDS, card
no. 72-0277), including the presence of peaks corresponding to the
GdVO4, which has a cubic zircon crystal structure (I41/amd space group).37 The NPs are pure-phase GdVO4 because
no other peaks are observed.

A Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopy absorption spectrum
is shown in Figure 2b. The characteristic peak arising from the vanadium-oxygen stretching
of tetrahedra appears at 800 nm; and this peak is known to appear
in the region from 800 to 1050 cm–1.41 Peaks of 3400 and 1600 cm–1 result from the widening absorptions of water.

2.2 Optical Properties and Spectroscopic Data
Unfortunately,
using UV excitation for in vivo imaging is limited
by its uncaging process, which is very harmful,
and it is difficult to apply this method to deep tissues because of
the poor tissue penetration depth.4,42 Downshifting
emission excited by UV radiation (360 nm) cannot be effectively used
for in vivo bioimaging limited by the greatly absorption
of biological tissue in the UV spectral region (the quite short penetration
length for the excitation radiation). In contrast, because of the
advantages of NIR light, such as its tissue penetrability and low
damage to cells and tissues, NIR light bands are ideal for biomedical
applications.43 The upconversion luminescence
of Nd3+ can be excited and emitted at 808 nm, which is
in the NIR range. It can achieve a higher signal-to-noise ratio and
deeper tissue penetration when applied to small animal imaging.44 Fortunately, phosphors could be excited by near-UV
radiation, as the excitation peak of GdVO4:Eu3+ can be shifted toward longer wavelengths if doped with Bi3+.34

For luminescence imaging, the
emission spectra and PL excitation of GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ were examined. GdVO4 is a superb host
material for downconversion because of its efficient energy transfer
to the excited states of RE3+ dopants and strong absorption
in the UV range.40 The 280 nm excitation
band is well known as the characteristic excitation spectral peak
of GdVO4:Eu3+, on account of charge-transfer
band from O2– to V5+ within [VO4]3– groups; subsequently energy is transferred
to the Eu3+ cations.34,43−46 The excitation spectra were because of the main emission line of
Eu3+ ions in REVO4 at 618 nm, and they were
broadly examined in the near-UV range. In Figure 3a, the Bi3+ cations were introduced
into the host lattice that leads to a new energy band, the maximum
location of the wide absorption band, which is centered at approximately
360 nm. This shift can be explained by the appearance of the Bi3+ to V5+ CT process, following by energy transfer
to Eu3+ cations.47

and emission spectrum (Ex = 360 nm, Em = 618
nm) of GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NPs. (b) Schematic
diagram of the proposed energetic processes occurring in the GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ samples. (c) Transmissivity
spectrum of the samples; the inset shows the sample under near-UV-light
and white-light excitation. (d) Luminescence time traces of the GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NPs under UV-light irradiation
for 1 h.

In Figure 3a, under
UV excitation at 360 nm, emission spectra of the suspensions of the
NPs displayed the characteristic transitions of Eu3+ cations
from 5D0 to 7FJ (J = 1–4), and the 5D0 to 7F2 transition induces the highest
intensity emission line at 618 nm.33 The
electric dipole transition 5D0 to 7F2 leads to the strong red light of GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NPs. In addition, the schematic diagram
of energy-transfer processes of different ions shown in the emission
spectrum are displayed in Figure 3b.

The transmissivity (T) of
the GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NP solution is
shown in Figure 3c,
indicating that
the light wavelength is broadened. Furthermore, under visible-light
irradiation, the transmissivity of the material solution increased,
and the T value approached 1. In accordance with
the T value, the material solutions absorb near-UV
light and emit red visible light (inset of Figure 3c).

To determine the photostability
of the NPs, luminescence time traces
of GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NPs were obtained
with 2 min bins under irradiation for 1 h. The result shows that no
photobleaching was observed after constant irradiation, demonstrating
the good photostability of the GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NPs for long-term bioimaging (Figure 3d).

2.3 Cell Imaging
In Figure 4c–e, the uptake
characteristics
of the prepared NPs by HepG2 cells (human liver HCC cells) were tested
by confocal laser-scanning microscopy, which was recorded by the tetramethylrhodamine
(TRITC) channel. In the interior of the cells, a bright red emission
was observed. This suggests that the HepG2 cells can be effectively
taken up by the NPs. The results indicate that the NPs are suitable
CAs for fluorescence imaging in vitro. However, the
low emission wavelength of the NPs is not suitable for in-depth in vivo fluorescence imaging.48

right photo shows the control sample under visible light). Fluorescence

and (e) merged channels.

2.4 Magnetic
Properties and MRI Applications
To make the GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NPs
sufficiently compatible for further MRI applications, their magnetic
properties were investigated with a vibrating sample magnetometer
(VSM). As shown in Figure 6a, the room-temperature (RT) magnetization curve was linearly
correlated with the magnetization intensity of 1.28 emu/g of NPs at
10 kOe, indicating that the NPs have potential applications in MRI.

Figure 5a,b shows in vitroT1 and T2 measurements for Gd3+-doped RE NPs in aqueous
suspensions with different Gd3+ concentrations. The literature
contains many reports showing that Gd3+-doped RE NPs have
extremely low relaxivity, which limits their applications. In fact,
most reports have focused on the T1 contrast
effect but not the T2 contrast effect.
Paramagnetic Gd-based MRI CAs exhibit increased signal intensity in
the T1-weighted images, so they are defined
as “positive CAs”.50 Actually,
Gd3+ ions have seven unpaired electrons, which can generate
large magnetic fluctuations, resulting in the shortening of the T1 and T2 values
of the surrounding protons. In general, a low concentration of Gd3+ shortens the T1 values, whereas
extreme T2 shortening occurs at high Gd3+ concentrations. The GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NPs exhibit a high signal intensity, with an r1 value of r1 = 7.87 mM–1 s–1 and an r2 value of 58.39 mM–1 s–1. The r2/r1 ratio of the NPs was calculated as 7.42, indicating that the GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NPs have potential applications
as dual-weighted MRI CAs (both T1 and T2) for in vivo MRI,49 although the high r1 (r1 = 7.87 mM–1 s–1) of the GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NPs was also observed. Obviously, the NPs’ r2/r1 ratio is higher than
the clinical value (r2/r1 ratio close to 1), primarily due to the T2-shortening effect. Additionally, GdVO4-related
NPs have been mostly used as T1-weighted
CAs in vitro and in vivo,28,51 and few studies on the applications of these NPs for T2-weighted MRI have been conducted.

mice in vivo before (left: t = 0
min) and after (right) the injection of GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NPs into the tail vein. The red circle shows the
tumor site.

Therefore, for in vivo MRI studies, we concentrated
on the function of the NPs as T2 MRI CAs.
As shown in Figure 5d, tumor-bearing BALB/c nude mice were intravenously injected at
a dose of 10 mg of Gd per kg of mice body weight before recording
by T2WI. After injecting the CA, a significant
decrease of approximately 44% at 10 min (instead of an increase) was
observed in the signal strength of the hepatic parenchyma regions
in T2WI by measuring the signal intensities
of the regions of tumor and liver regions, possibly due to the
effective uptake of NPs. Meanwhile, the tumor tissue showed an enhancement
of 27% in the tumor at 10 min (Figure 5c), suggesting an obvious T1 effect of the tumor tissue. This finding is consistent with previous
reports of a lack of Kupffer cells in HCCs.52,53

2.5 Biocompatibility and Toxicity
Before
GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NPs can be used for in vivo multimodal imaging, toxicity testing is crucial.
The NPs’ cytotoxicity was evaluated by a Cell Counting Kit-8
(CCK-8) assay on HepG2 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial
cells (HUVECs). HepG2 cells and HUVECs were incubated for 24 h in
NP suspensions with NP concentrations ranging between 0 and 10 μM. In Figure 6, the change in proliferation
was negligible for the treated cells.

(b) after incubation with
GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NPs at increasing
Gd concentrations. (a,b) Cell viability was measured by a CCK-8 array
using the means and SD of the number of experiments per experimental
group.

To further evaluate the long-term
safety of the GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NPs,
20 healthy BALB/c mice were
sacrificed and dissected at 0, 3, 7, and 14 days after intravenous
administration with GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NP suspension (n = 5, respectively). Histological
analysis (in Figure 7) revealed that the organs (heart, spleen, liver, lung, and kidney)
were normal. In addition, no deaths or behavioral changes were observed
among the animals after NP administration, indicating that the GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NPs are biocompatible.

of GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NPs into normal
mice at 0, 3, 7, and 14 days (scale bar = 100 μm).

3 Experimental
Section
3.1 Materials
Fetal bovine serum (FBS)
was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). CCK-8 was acquired from
Dojindo, Japan. Trypsin, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and RPMI
1640 medium were supplied by HyClone (Thermo, USA). Other reagents
were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Shanghai,
China). All chemicals were used as acquired without further purification.
Ultrapure water was obtained from a Milli-Q water system.

3.2 NPs Synthesis
The GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NPs were synthesized using our group’s
previously established method for preparing layered RE hydroxides.53,54 During GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NPs’
synthesis, suitable amounts of the RE precursor LnCl3 (Ln
= Gd, Eu, Bi) were dissolved in ultrapure water to a concentration
of 0.5 M. Under vigorous agitation, 1 mL of PEI solution (10% by weight)
was added. The resulting solution was purged with nitrogen for 1 min
to eliminate oxygen after stirring for another 5 min. The mixture
was sealed into a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, which was maintained
at 200 °C for 2.5 h. The reaction mixture was stirred magnetically
to remove the supernatant via centrifugation at 10 000 rpm
for 5 min, after naturally cooling to RT. The precipitate was washed
twice by ethanol and once with water and then redispersed with 5.0
mL Milli-Q water. Powder was obtained after the precipitate was dried
for 12 h at 40 °C.

3.3 Characterization of the
NPs
A transmission
electron microscope (Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN, FEI, USA) was used to obtain
the TEM micrographs of the GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NPs. EDS coupled with TEM was used to analyze the element
compositions of the NPs. An X’Pert Pro diffractometer (X’Pert
Pro MPD DY129, PANalytical, Netherlands) was used to conduct XRD.
The crystal structure was determined through SAED (XRD, AXIS Ultra
DLD, UK). FTIR (Nicolet 6700, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) was used
to characterize the samples. Fluorescence emission spectra of the
NPs were observed on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer
equipped with a Xe lamp excitation source. The NPs’ photostability
was assessed by using a Cary 5000 UV–vis–NIR spectrometer
to analyze the absorption spectra of immobilized NPs under continuous
UV irradiation.

3.4 Cell Culture and Cytotoxicity
Test
The HepG2 cell line and HUVEC line were supplied from
the Cell Bank
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). The cells were
incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere, with high-glucose
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (HyClone), within
1% streptomycin/penicillin (HyClone) and 10% FBS. A CCK-8 assay (Dojindo,
Japan) was used to determine the in vitro cytotoxicity
of the NPs. Briefly, 5 × 103 cells of the HepG2 cells
or HUVECs were planted into 96-well plates. After seeding for 24 h,
the cells were then exposed to NP solutions at different concentrations
and cultured overnight. The gadolinium concentrations were 0, 0.001,
0.01, 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 μM. The cells were
then washed by PBS twice and tested by CCK-8 assay at 37 °C.
The absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a Varioskan Flash microplate
reader. Every result is reported as the average of six samples; the
data are shown as the mean ± standard deviation (SD).

3.5 Cellular Uptake and Imaging
HepG2
cells were used to demonstrate the suitability of GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NPs for bioimaging. Typically, the
2 × 105 HepG2 was incubated in each well of a 6-well
plate with cover glasses for 24 h. Following, 1000 μg/mL NPs were added to each chamber after refreshing the growth medium.
Then, cocultured for 2 h at 37 °C under a moist atmosphere of
5% CO2. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution
for 15 min at RT after washing three times in PBS and then stained
with a DAPI solution. The stained cells were washed and detected via
confocal laser-scanning microscope (Ni-E, Nikon, Japan) with a 20×
lens to obtain the luminescence images.

3.6 Establishment
of a Liver Orthotopic Transplantation
Tumor-Bearing Mouse Model
The animal experiment was conducted
following the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Sichuan
University. Twenty male 7-week-old BALB/c nude mice, each weighed
approximately 20 g, were acquired from the Institute of Experimental
Animals, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences. HepG2 cells were harvested
and resuspended in sterile PBS. For the orthotopic xenograft tumor
model, mice were anesthetized via an intraperitoneal administration
of chloral hydrate (10 wt %), and 1 × 106 HepG2 cells
in 10 μL were injected slowly in the lower
left lobe of the hepar (the largest one) after laparotomy directly.55

3.7 MR Relaxometry and in Vivo Imaging
The magnetization values of the
NPs were measured
by a VSM (Lake Shore 7410) at RT under an applied field ranging between
0 and 2.0 T. A 3.0 T clinical MRI instrument (Siemens Trio Tim) was
performed to study in vitro MR relaxometry. To measure
the MR relaxivity r1 and r2 values, the GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NP solutions of different Gd3+ concentrations
(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 mM) in 4.0 mL test tubes in the PBS buffer
containing 1% agarose were prepared.

Five mice with liver tumor
xenografts underwent MRI with the rat coil on a 3.0 T MRI system (Siemens
Trio Tim). The relevant MR parameters are as follows: T2-weighted fast spin-echo, sequence: echo time (TE): 83
ms; repetition time (TR): 3000 ms; slice thickness: 1 mm; field of
view: 60 × 60 cm2; matrix: 320 × 320 pixels.
After the tumor models were established, the mice were anesthetized
with 10 wt % chloral hydrate, and 1 mmol Gd/mL of GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NPs was injected intravenously via
the tail at a concentration of 10 mg Gd/kg mouse. Each mouse was scanned
0, 10, 30, 48, and 60 min after injection.

To quantify the contrast
enhancement, ImageJ software was used
to measure the signal intensity of interest in tumors and normal hepatic
tissues. The signal intensities were compared after normalization.

3.8 In Vivo Toxicity Studies
and Histological Analysis
Healthy male BALB/c mice were divided
into four groups (n = 5 for each group) randomly,
and 10 mg of Gd per kg mouse weight GdVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ NP suspension was intravenously injected into the
BALB/c mice through the tail vein for the three test groups (n = 15), and the control group (n = 5)
was injected with 0.9 wt % NaCl.

To study the histologic changes,
mice were sacrificed at 0, 3, 7, and 14 days after administration.
The internal organs (liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys) were
collected, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin.
The 5 μm-thick sections were evaluated with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).

3.9 Statistical
Analysis
All data are
expressed as the mean ± SD. Every in vitro experiment
was conducted in triplicate. In vitro data of different
experimental groups were compared via a one-way analysis of variance
and Student’s t-test. In vivo data of different experimental groups were similarly compared. Statistical
analysis was performed using Prism 6.0 software with P < 0.05, which indicates significant differences between experimental
groups.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion,
GdVO4 NPs containing Eu3+ and
Bi3+ ions are multimodal imaging agents that enable efficient
MR T2-weighted imaging and DSL luminescence
imaging. The NPs can be excited in the near-UV and visible spectra
ranges, and they have an excitation peak at 360 nm caused by the introduction
of Bi3+ ions and an emission peak at 618 nm that is characteristic
of the spectral profile of Eu3+. Photostability experiments
indicated that the NPs can provide luminescence images or enable cell
monitoring in vivo in the long term. The relaxivity
of these NPs demonstrated a 7.42 mM–1 s–1 high r2/r1 ratio for 3.0 T MRI, indicating that the NPs are suitable as a negative
MRI CA. This observation conforms to the T2WI. The negative contrast enhances the tumor-to-liver contrast in
HCC-bearing mice. Furthermore, the good biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity
of the NPs indicate their potential for biomedical applications.
