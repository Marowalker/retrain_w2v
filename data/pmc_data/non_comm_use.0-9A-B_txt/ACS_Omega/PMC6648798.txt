With
a combination of outstanding properties and a wide spectrum
of applications, graphene has emerged as a significant nanomaterial.
However, to realize its full potential for practical applications,
a number of obstacles have to be overcome, such as low-temperature,
transfer-free growth on desired substrates. In most of the reports,
direct graphene growth is confined to either a small area or high
sheet resistance. Here, an attempt has been made to grow large-area
graphene directly on insulating substrates, such as quartz and glass,
using magnetron-generated microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition
at a substrate temperature of 300 °C with a sheet resistance
of 1.3k Ω/□ and transmittance of 80%. Graphene is characterized
using Raman microscopy, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron
microscopy, optical imaging, UV–vis spectroscopy, and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy. Four-probe resistivity and Hall effect
measurements were performed to investigate electronic properties.
Key to this report is the use of 0.3 sccm CO2 during growth
to put a control over vertical graphene growth, generally forming
carbon walls, and 15–20 min of O3 treatment on as-synthesized
graphene to improve sheet carrier mobility and transmittance. This
report can be helpful in growing large-area graphene directly on insulating
transparent substrates at low temperatures with advanced electronic
properties for applications in transparent conducting electrodes and
optoelectronics.

Introduction
A huge number of publications
have been reported on various synthesis
methods and possible future applications of graphene after successful
exfoliation of single-layer graphene by Geim et al. in 2004, revealing
significant electrical, optical, and chemical properties.1−10 Among various synthesis methods, thermal chemical vapor deposition
(TCVD) has proven to be the simplest and cost effective for industrial
grade graphene synthesis.11−15 However, the use of catalysts during graphene growth in TCVD has
created extra challenges for researchers, such as removal of the catalyst
and transfer of graphene from such catalyst materials on to desired
substrates.16−19 Much awaited future applications of graphene, such as transparent
conductive electrodes, have also been delayed due to use of a catalyst
and the inevitable transfer process during graphene synthesis using
TCVD. Furthermore, TCVD is generally a high-temperature process; the
substrate temperature used for graphene growth is usually more than
1000 °C. Researchers are still in the process of finding a better
alternative to synthesize graphene at lower temperatures directly
on desired substrates to end the search of an alternative to indium
tin oxide for 20 years.20

To overcome
these problems, many researchers have tried direct
graphene growth on insulating substrates using TCVD. Ismach et al.
in 2010 reported direct growth of graphene on various insulating substrates.
But, using 1000 °C as the working temperature would not be feasible for a variety of substrates
intolerant to such elevated temperatures.21 In a recent report, Song et al. also attempted transfer-free graphene
growth on an insulating substrate by using copper vapors similar to
the above report.22 To produce roll-to-roll
graphene, Sony Corporation selectively heated a copper sheet by applying
electric current to a copper catalyst sheet to synthesize 100 m long
graphene. However, some authors in a previous work accept that the
use of high temperature may cause defects in graphene as the temperature
of the copper sheet is raised to approximately 1000 °C during
the Joule heating process.23 It would be
always better if the synthesis temperature is reduced and the transfer
process is avoided to obtain more or less a similar quality of graphene.

Apart from TCVD, another method such as plasma CVD has been also
used by researchers for direct synthesis of graphene on an insulating
substrate without using any catalyst.24−26 The advantage of using
plasma CVD is that it does not require high-temperature heating of
the substrate, unlike TCVD.27 Sun et al.
have used plasma-enhanced CVD for direct synthesis of graphene on
various insulating substrates at a temperature range of 400–600
°C.28 However, this led to carbon
nanowall formation, with vertical growth dominating over lateral graphene
growth. Muñoz et al. recently reported 300 nm graphene crystals
formed using plasma CVD with a sheet resistance of 1.8 kΩ/□.29 In another report, Yamada et al. have used plasma
CVD for roll-to-roll synthesis of graphene with transmittance of about
89% on poly(ethylene terephthalate) film and sheet resistance in the
order of 106 kΩ/□.30 Kim et
al. in 2014 used inductively coupled plasma to grow patterned graphene
(500 μm in size) with sheet resistance of 1.4 kΩ/□
and 75% transmittance at 500 °C.31 Plasma CVD with so much potential in roll-to-roll direct graphene
growth at low temperatures encourages many researchers to choose it
over TCVD. So far, direct graphene growth is confined to either small
area or high sheet resistance of graphene.32,33 Here, we have attempted to grow large-area graphene directly on
insulating substrates, such as quartz, SiO2/Si, and glass,
using magnetron-generated microwave plasma CVD (PCVD) at a substrate
temperature of 300 °C and the effect of ozone (O3)
treatment on as-synthesized graphene has been studied to improve sheet
resistance and transmittance of graphene.

Results and Discussion
Experiments were performed at different CO2 concentrations
along with CH4, H2, and Ar with an initial microwave
power of 800 W. It was found that at CO2 concentrations
higher than 0.3 standard cubic centimeters (sccm), sheet resistance
of the deposited carbon film increased drastically. With respect to
sheet resistance and transmittance, 0.3 sccm of CO2 along
with CH4, H2, and Ar gave acceptable results. Figure 1b shows that sheet
resistance and transmittance of as-deposited substrates varied with
CO2 concentration. After spotting the best concentration
of CO2, experiments with other microwave powers were performed
and 1000 W was found to give acceptable deposition among 700–1200
W microwave powers (please refer to Table S1 in the Supporting Information for a detailed explanation). Synthesized
films on glass and quartz were first characterized by Raman spectroscopy. Figure 1c shows a typical
Raman spectrum of graphene on a glass surface. Peaks at 1350, 1580,
and 2682 cm–1 correspond to D peak, G peak, and
2D peak, respectively, confirming the formation of few-layer graphene
on a glass surface. Similarly, the Raman spectrum for quartz shown
in Figure 1d also confirms
the formation of graphene. The D peak seen in the Raman spectrum can
be attributed to defects, such as lattice disorders and unintentional
impurity substitutional doping in synthesized graphene lattice.35 It is also observed from previous reports that
plasma CVD forms vertically grown carbon walls or diamondlike carbon
much easily than lateral graphene growth.36,37 Along with lattice disorders, vertical carbon walls or diamondlike
carbon may give rise to defect peaks in the Raman spectrum. A strong
D peak is a typical feature of diamondlike carbon because of a nanocrystalline
structure and more defects, such as disorders, vacancies, and strains.38 Therefore, to evaluate the morphology of as-synthesized
graphene, we performed detailed surface morphology examination using
optical imaging, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) analyses.

direct graphene
synthesis, (b) dependence of sheet resistance and transmittance of

growth, Raman spectra of (c) glass and (d) quartz surfaces after carbon
film deposition using PCVD.

Figure 2a
shows
the optical image of a quartz surface after graphene growth. From
the optical image observed, there is no clear evidence of carbon wall
formation. Also the SEM image in Figure 2b captured with the sample inclined by 60°
with respect to the horizontal clearly shows an almost smooth surface
except for a small hump highlighted by an ellipse indicating that
graphene has grown laterally. The AFM analysis shown in Figure 2c,d also confirms that no carbon
wall formation occurred, and the line profile (Figure 2e) of the quartz surface indicates that graphene
is laterally grown on a quartz substrate with a surface roughness
of a few units of nanometers. From surface morphology examinations,
it is clear that lateral graphene has been formed; therefore, the
D peak in the Raman spectrum might have appeared either by lattice
disorders in graphene or the smaller grain size of graphene or defects
caused due to high-energy radicals forming plasma.39 Nevertheless, the use of the 0.3 sccm CO2 during
the synthesis process has improved sheet resistance and transmittance
by a considerable amount. A comparative study between graphene synthesis
without and with CO2 has been shown below for a better
understanding of CO2 impact on graphene growth. In Figure 3a, a typical cross-sectional
SEM image of a silicon sample with graphene deposition without CO2 clearly shows vertically grown structures, whereas in Figure 3b, a cross-sectional
SEM image of the sample with CO2 shows that there is no
such vertical growth. Figure 3c,d shows the top view optical image of the same graphene
samples, revealing differences in surface morphologies of sample surfaces
after deposition without and with CO2. The Raman spectrum
in Figure 3e shows
a higher D peak with G′ and diminished 2D peaks indicating
the formation of a graphitic structure with higher defects, disorders,
and unintentional structural impurities such as carbon walls, whereas
in the case of graphene synthesis with CO2, the Raman spectrum
in Figure 3f shows
an elevated 2D peak and comparatively diminished D peak.

A plasma environment has various factors affecting the growth
of
graphene, such as different mobilities of electrons or positive ions
at different gas compositions, pressure and temperature gradients,
microwave power, etc. Also, numerous carbon network formations can
be imagined due to infinite bonding possibilities offered by sp3 and sp2 sites. A possible growth mechanism can
be as explained on the basis of the hydrogen (H)-shifting reaction.
Hydrogen is well known for catalytic activity; H-shifting activates
a series forming C2Hx (eqs 1 and 2) in the hot region, which on further H-shifting may lead to the
formation of CnHy species.40 Possible reaction equations
can be written as follows 1   2     3   4  Ar is usually added to enhance the plasma
stability. It makes plasma capable of providing electrons of higher
energy and the required level of ionization. There are some reports
on Ar helping in C2 formation route (eq 3). This, in turn, enhances the degree of graphitization
on the substrate. Nevertheless, a higher concentration of C2 may also boost vertical growth or diamondlike structures with prominent
D peaks (see also Figure S2), as illustrated
in Figure 4a.41 On the other hand, the introduction of a small
amount of CO2 is found to yield improved graphene growth.
Son et al. in 2016 reported that CO2 helps in graphene
growth with lesser defects by etching poor cross-links between growing
flakes.42 The etching property of CO2 might help in removal of excess sp3 carbon (eq 4), helping in reduction
of vertical growth or diamondlike carbon and, in turn, reducing the
defects. With suppressed vertical growth, sp2 bonded C–C
chain might dominate to form lateral graphene, as illustrated in Figure 4b. Therefore, introduction
of CO2 during the growth process can be useful for lateral
graphene growth using plasma CVD with improved sheet resistance and
transmittance.

Figure 4 (a, b) Schematic representation of the graphene growth
mechanism
without and with CO2 use in plasma CVD, respectively.

To estimate the thickness of graphene,
a scratch was made on a
continuous graphene/SiO2/Si surface and AFM measurement
was performed. Graphene was deposited directly on SiO2/Si
especially for AFM analysis to get a clear contrast between the surface
and graphene. The contrast on SiO2/Si surface with graphene
layers makes it easier to locate the scratch in the optical observation
during AFM measurement. Figure 5a shows the AFM image of graphene/SiO2/Si surface
with a scratched surface on the left and graphene (yellowish part)
on the right side in the image. The figure also confirms lateral graphene
growth on SiO2/Si surface complimenting previous explanations.
The line profile in Figure 5b confirms the formation of few-layer graphene with a thickness
of 1.2 nm on SiO2/Si surface. Figure 5c,d shows a magnified AFM image of the graphene
sample, revealing graphene grain size of 50–70 nm. To further
investigate the grain size of as-grown graphene and surface morphology,
the deposition time was reduced to 2 min and then AFM measurements
were performed. The AFM image shown in Figure S5 indicates that the graphene grain size varies from 20–30
nm, suggesting that graphene grains grow in size and overlap each
other on increasing the deposition time. Sheet resistance measurements
performed using the four-probe technique reveal that graphene has
been formed with sheet resistance varying from 2.1 to 2.8 kΩ/□,
as shown in Figure 6a and transmittance in Figure 6b from 74 to 80% (both with blue lines). With the above-mentioned
growth conditions, few nanometer thick large-area graphene can be
synthesized on an insulating substrate at a temperature of 300 °C.

Figure 6 Effect of ozone treatment on (a) sheet resistance and (b) transmittance
of PCVD-synthesized graphene.

Directly synthesized graphene on insulating substrates with
a sheet
resistance of 2.1–2.8 kΩ/□ and transmittance of
74–80% was treated with ozone for various time periods to remove
surface contaminations. It is assumed that ozone treatment would cleanse
surface contaminations such as amorphous carbon or other surface impurities.
There are reports on the ozone treatment of TCVD graphene or exfoliated
graphene. However, this is the first report on the ozone treatment
of graphene synthesized using microwave plasma CVD without a transfer
process. According to a report by Li et al., 10 min of ultraviolet/ozone
treatment of transferred graphene synthesized using TCVD is found
to enhance metal–graphene contact by removal of surface contaminations.
Also, such a short duration exposure of UV/ozone did not introduce
disorders in as-synthesized graphene.43Figure 6 shows the
change in sheet resistance of graphene after the ozone treatment.
It is clear from the figure that graphene exposed in ozone for the
time range between 15 and 20 min has better qualities in terms of
sheet resistance and transmittance than as-synthesized graphene. The
sheet resistance and transmittance of the quartz substrate changed
from 2.2 kΩ/□ and 79% to 1.3 kΩ/□ and 80%,
respectively, after 15 min of ozone treatment, as shown in Figure 6. Raman mapping has
also been performed to understand the quality of graphene on a larger
scale. Figure 7a–c
shows the Raman spectroscope map of D peak, G peak, and 2D peak intensity,
respectively, with baseline correction. Mapping shows formation of
graphene in the 20 × 20 μm2 range with some
defects. These defects can be attributed to the smaller grain size
of graphene and/or defect sites, as mentioned earlier. Figure 8a shows the Raman spectroscope
map of normalized G/2D; it can be seen from the map that G peak intensity
is higher than 2D peak intensity in most of the areas, indicating
formation of few-layer graphene, and from the mapping image of D/G
intensities shown in Figure 8b, it is clear that the large-area graphene is formed with
varying D peak intensity.

peak intensity, and
(c) 2D peak intensity.

Figure 8 Raman mapping of (a) G/2D peak intensity and (b) D/G peak intensity.

Ozone exposure has improved graphene
sheet resistance by 30–35%
and transmittance by 1%. To investigate the effect of ozone treatment
on graphene, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed
on as-grown and ozone-treated graphene samples. Figure 9a shows XPS survey of graphene/quartz surface
before and after the ozone treatment, indicating the presence of silicon
(Si), carbon (C), and oxygen (O). Figure 9b showing the C 1s spectrum confirms the
formation of sp2 carbon with a peak at 284.25 eV assigned
to C–C bonding.44 The shift in C
1s peak can be clearly seen in the figure from 284.25 to 284.4 eV
after the ozone treatment. This shift of 0.15 eV toward higher binding
energy can be attributed to physisorption of ozone molecules on graphene.45 The physisorption binding energy of ozone on
the graphene surface is less than 0.3 eV.46 As reported by Jandhyala et al., this physisorbed ozone can be responsible
for the upshift of the Dirac point, leading to p-type doping of mechanically
exfoliated graphene. With the increase in p-type doping, an improved
electrical conductivity can be expected.47 The ozone treatment of graphene for more than 20 min would lead
to the formation of epoxide groups on the graphene basal plane due
to chemisorption of ozone. This would lead to an increase in surface
defects in graphene and thus increase in sheet resistance.48 There are reports on sheet resistance and mobility
enhancement using the ozone treatment of exfoliated graphene also,
apart from TCVD-grown graphene.49 However,
this is the first report of ozone treatment on directly grown graphene
using plasma CVD. Table 1 shows the effect of the ozone treatment on sheet carrier mobility
and sheet carrier concentration of graphene. Carrier mobility increases
up to 97.5 cm2/(V s) after the ozone treatment with a reduction
in sheet carrier concentration. The increase in mobility is 43.8%
more than the calculated value of mobility, and the decrease in carrier
concentration is 56.2% less than the calculated value of carrier concentration
in the case when no effect of ozone is assumed (Table S3). These mismatches in carrier mobility and concentration
confirm that the ozone treatment has a constructive effect on sheet
resistance of graphene. Oxygen, as detected in the O 1s spectrum shown
in Figure 9c, might
have appeared from either use of CO2 during the synthesis
process or quartz surface beneath the graphene film or C–O
bond formation. The O 1s spectrum also shows the formation of a hump
toward higher binding energy after the ozone treatment. This hump
at 533.8 eV can be attributed to Si–O bonding, indicating that
the quartz surface is exposed more to X-rays after the ozone treatment.
Hump formation in O 1s spectrum confirms that the ozone treatment
removes surface contaminations (such as sp3-bonded amorphous
carbon) (Figure S4) and forms physisorbed
ozone on the graphene surface, which might help in improving sheet
carrier mobility and sheet resistance of graphene. Figure 9d confirms that there is no
nitrogen in as-grown graphene or after the ozone treatment.

Conclusions
In conclusion, direct graphene growth on
a 2 × 2 cm2 insulating substrate has been achieved
at a temperature of 300 °C
using magnetron-generated plasma CVD. The growth of graphene is controlled
by using a small amount of CO2. After further treatment
with ozone, graphene with sheet resistance 1.3 kΩ/□ and
80% transmittance is obtained. The ozone treatment is found to clean
surface contamination, enhancing transmittance and sheet carrier mobility
of graphene. These results can be useful in direct growth of graphene
at low temperatures on any insulating substrates, escalating research
in the field of predicted industrial application possibilities of
graphene.

Experimental Section
Experiments were performed on
a 2 × 2 × 0.1 cm3 quartz piece and micro slide
glass (procured from Matsunami Glass
IND. LTD. Japan) using the plasma CVD (Shinko Seiki, Japan) with a
quartz plate followed by another quartz plate having apertures. It
has been reported that on using a quartz plate with holes, plasma
is generated without any density jump and has a higher density as
compared to that using a flat plate. High-density plasma can be generated
on a meter-scale, and large-area deposition can be easily achieved
using such plasma CVD.34 The schematic
representation of the system used for the growth of graphene film
is shown in Figure 1a. For deposition of graphene, a gas mixture of methane (CH4), hydrogen (H2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and
argon (Ar) with flow rates of 4, 15, 0.3, and 15 sccm (standard cubic
centimeters per min), respectively, were chosen for all experiments
after optimization. The microwave power of 1000 W having a negligible
amount of fluctuation was used. A gas composition pressure of 10 Pa
was used for a duration of 4 min for graphene deposition (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information) on a
micro slide glass and quartz-sonicated for 15 min in acetone. After
deposition, insulating substrates were treated with ozone to further
improve the sheet resistance and transmittance of deposited carbon
films on glass and quartz. Ozone was produced using a high-voltage
supply (9 kV) between stainless steel mesh separated by 8 mm. After
deposition, substrates were characterized with Raman spectroscopy
with a laser excitation energy of 532 nm using the Renishaw InVia
Laser Raman microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
using PHI 5000 VersaProbe. To analyze the surface morphology of the
deposited carbon film, optical imaging with a Keyence VHX-6000 optical
microscope, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with JSM-6510, and
the Innova atomic force microscope (AFM) Bruker were used. Optical
transmittance characterization of the carbon-deposited surfaces was
carried out with UV–vis–NIR on a JASCOV570 spectrophotometer.
The sheet resistance of carbon film was measured with a four-probe
technique (RT-70V-Napson Corporation, Japan). Hall effect measurements
were carried out using Lake Shore 8400 Series (Toyo Corporation, Japan)
with the van der Pauw technique.
