To improve the NO2-sensing
performance of single-walled
carbon nanotube (SWCNT)-based sensors, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoclusters
(NCs) were functionalized by a microwave (MW)-assisted synthesis technique.
Gas sensors based on pristine SWCNTs and ZnO NC–SWCNT composites
synthesized using different weight ratios (ZnO/SWCNTs = 0.5:1, 1:1,
2:1, and 3:1) were fabricated, and their ability to sense various
gases at room temperature (25 °C) was investigated. The results
showed that the sensing performance of the ZnO NC–SWCNT composite
synthesized with a weight ratio of 1:1 (denoted as Z-SWCNTs) was significantly
enhanced with respect to NO2 response and selectivity.
This enhanced sensing performance is thought to be a result of both
the modulation of the conduction channel at the ZnO NC–SWCNT
heterointerfaces and the generation of defects (or holes) by MW irradiation
that act as active sites for the target gases. The results obtained
in this work provide not only a facile method of cofunctionalizing
oxide NCs and defects but also a new methodology for improving the
sensing capabilities of SWCNT-based gas sensors.

1 Introduction
Nitrogen
dioxide (NO2) is emitted from the combustion
of fossil fuels and in the exhaust of motor vehicles and is a colorless,
flammable gas. NO2 is very harmful to the environment and
is a major cause of acid rain and smog.1−3 In addition, NO2 is detrimental to the respiratory system of human beings and animals,
even at very low concentrations.4,5 Therefore, the National
Institute of Occupational Safety and Health stipulates an “immediately
dangerous to life or health” value for NO2 of 20
ppm. According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
standard, the permissible exposure limit value for NO2 is
5 ppm. Hence, the development of NO2 gas sensors with both
high sensitivity and selectivity is important for public health and
environmental protection.

Among the various types of NO2 gas sensors, chemiresistive
gas sensors based on semiconductors, such as metal oxides, have been
extensively explored and developed because of their high sensitivity,
quick response, low cost, and simple fabrication technique.6,7 However, for practical applications in gas sensors, the poor selectivity
and high-temperature operation of semiconducting metal oxide (SMO)-based
sensing layers remain as obstacles. The highly selective, room-temperature
detection of NO2 gas molecules has been attempted using
diverse strategies, such as materials design, doping, functionalizing,
and surface engineering, and demonstrated by numerous researchers.8−14 Among the many attempts that have been reported in recent years,
composite nanostructures consisting of SMO and carbon-based materials
are promising sensing platforms that can operate at room temperature
with excellent sensing properties. For example, Ruan et al. prepared
nanocomposites consisting of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and α-Fe2O3. The rGO/α-Fe2O3 nanocomposites exhibited enhanced NO2-sensing capabilities
at room temperature as compared to pure rGO.15 In addition, Zeng et al. synthesized ternary NiO–SnO2–rGO nanocomposites utilizing the hydrothermal method.
The NO2-sensing performance of the ternary nanocomposites
was significantly improved in comparison to those of bare NiO and
binary NiO-rGO nanocomposites.16

Furthermore, to increase the sensitivity to target gases at room
temperature, Chen et al. intentionally synthesized holey rGO nanostructures
using a hydrothermal system. The holey rGO nanostructure was tested
for various gas species including NO2, NH3,
CO, H2S, and H2.17 The synthesized nanoporous rGO exhibited a highly enhanced response
and selectivity for NO2 at room temperature. Recently,
we have also reported that defect-induced single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWCNTs) prepared by a simple heat treatment technique showed superior
sensing performances for NO2 gas at room temperature in
comparison with pristine SWCNTs.18 Thus,
the defects (or holes) formed by the perforation process remarkably
improve the sensing capabilities of carbon-based materials by offering
many sites for gas adsorption, as well as channels for gas diffusion.

Hence, to form the defects (or holes) on the surface of carbon-based
materials, we have applied a heat treatment method utilizing microwave
(MW) irradiation. The heat treatment by MW irradiation is more effective
in comparison with conventional heating by conduction or convection.19 During the MW irradiation, Joule heating occurs
by the collision between the energetic charged particles, such as
electrons, and atoms in metals or semiconductors, opening the surface
of the SWCNTs.20 Therefore, based on the
aforementioned previous reports,17−20 it is speculated that carbon-based
nanocomposites synthesized via MW irradiation will possess larger
surface-to-volume ratios, more defect sites, more heterointerfaces,
and porous structures.

In this study, we present a simple route
to cofunctionalize SWCNTs
simultaneously with a metal oxide and defects, and we clarify the
synergistic effect of the SMO nanoclusters (NCs) and defects on the
SWCNT surfaces on NO2-sensing performance. The NO2 response of SWCNTs at room temperature was significantly improved
by cofunctionalization with n-type zinc oxide (n-ZnO) NCs and defects.
The selectivity for NO2 compared to other gas species such
as SO2, CO, C2H5OH, and NH3 was also enhanced by cofunctionalization. We systematically investigated
the synergistic effects of n-ZnO NCs and defects on improving the
NO2-sensing capabilities of the fabricated sensors. In
addition, we discuss and suggest an underlying sensing mechanism for
the n-ZnO NC-functionalized, defect-induced SWCNT nanocomposites.
Moreover, such a combination of SMOs and defects on the SWCNT surfaces
will result in low-cost, low-power flexible devices and gas sensors.

NC-functionalized defect-induced SWCNT sensors.

2 Results and Discussion
The n-ZnO NC-functionalized,
defect-induced SWCNTs were synthesized
by varying the fraction of starting materials by weight percent. Figure 2 shows the surface
morphologies of the pristine SWCNTs and synthesized samples. As shown
in Figure 2a,b, the
surface morphologies of the 0.5Z-SWCNT and Z-SWCNT samples are similar
to that of the pristine SWCNTs. However, it is evident that the surfaces
of the SWCNTs in 2Z-SWCNTs became unevenly covered with ZnO NCs (Figure 2c) and that the ZnO
NCs partially covered the surfaces of the SWCNTs in 3Z-SWCNTs, as
shown in Figure 2d.

(d) 2Z-SWCNTs, and (e) 3Z-SWNTs.

To investigate the surface morphology of the n-ZnO NC-functionalized,
defect-induced SWCNTs further, TEM analysis was performed with the
Z-SWCNT sample. Figure 3a shows a low-magnification TEM image of Z-SWCNTs. The figure clearly
shows that ZnO NCs with an average size of 20 nm are randomly anchored
on the surfaces of the SWCNTs. The high-magnification image in Figure 3b shows the lattice
fringes of the ZnO NCs and SWCNTs. The interface between the SWCNTs
and the ZnO nanoparticles clearly indicates that no significant reaction
took place between them during the microwave irradiation. As shown
in Figure 3c, the selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern contains several rings, indicating
that the Z-SWCNTs are polycrystalline. The ring patterns can be indexed
to the (111), (002), and (101) planes of hexagonal ZnO and the (100)
plane of carbon. The EDS elemental line profiles of Zn and O are shown
in Figure 3d. These
results clearly reveal that the ZnO NCs were successfully functionalized
on the surfaces of the SWCNTs via the MW-assisted synthesis method.
Furthermore, to confirm the defects (or holes) formed on the SWCNT
surfaces during the MW irradiation, we utilized the high-resolution
TEM with the pristine SWCNTs prior to and after MW irradiation for
further detailed analysis. As shown in Figure S1, in comparison with the pristine SWCNT, the sidewall of
MW-irradiated SWCNT partially collapsed by Joule heating generated
during the MW irradiation. Thus, it is reasonable to claim that the
defects (or holes) on the surface of SWCNTs can be created during
the MW irradiation.

TEM image,
(b) high-resolution TEM image, (c) SAED pattern taken from a region
of Z-SWCNTs, and (d) EDS elemental line profiles of Zn and O around
a ZnO NC.

XRD analysis was also carried
out to confirm the structural phase
of the n-ZnO NC-functionalized, defect-induced SWCNTs, and the results
are shown in Figure 4. From the XRD peaks of the ZnO (JCPDS No. 36-1451) and carbon (JCPDS
No. 75-0444) phases, successful functionalization of the ZnO NCs on
the surfaces of the SWCNTs was again demonstrated. The low intensity
of the carbon phase as compared to that of the ZnO phase was ascribed
to the low amount and low crystallinity of that phase (Figure 4a). For further investigation
of ZnO functionalization, we have performed XPS analysis with Z-SWCNTs.
As shown in Figure S2a, the XPS spectrum
taken from the Z-SWCNTs clearly shows the presence of ZnO NCs. Therefore,
it is reasonable to claim that the ZnO NCs were well functionalized
on the surfaces of SWCNTs during the MW irradiation.

for the C phase.

In addition, to support
the high-resolution TEM results regarding
the formation of defects (or holes) on the SWCNT sidewalls, we performed
Raman spectroscopy and BET analysis with the pristine and the MW-irradiated
SWCNT samples. The Raman data of the pristine and the MW-irradiated
SWCNTs are shown in Figure 5a and are normalized to the 2D peak intensity. As shown in Figure 5a, the peak intensity
ratio of the D to G peaks (ID/IG) of the MW-irradiated SWCNTs is approximately
2.85 times higher than that of the pristine SWCNTs. As is well known,23 the D and G peaks represent the defective nature
and the stacking nature of the nanographitic materials such as CNTs,
carbon fibers, graphene, graphene oxide (GO), and reduced graphene
oxide (rGO). Thus, the increase in the peak intensity ratio (ID/IG) is associated
with increased defect density on the SWCNT sidewalls. However, Lehman
et al. stated in a review paper that a relationship between the peak
intensity ratio (ID/IG) and defect density does not exist.24 On the other hand, another research group has argued that
the peak intensity ratio (ID/IG) is a reliable measure of defect density.25 Thus, it is likely that the relationship between
the peak intensity ratio (ID/IG) and defect density is still ambiguous. Therefore, to
understand the formation of defects on SWCNT sidewalls better, we
carried out BET analysis to measure the surface areas and pore diameter
distributions of the pristine and the MW-irradiated SWCNTs. As shown
in Figure 5b, the surface
areas and the pore diameter distributions for the pristine and the
MW-irradiated SWCNTs were measured by nitrogen adsorption using the
BET method. The average pore diameters of the pristine and the MW-irradiated
SWCNTs were 14.5 and 17.4 nm, respectively. In addition, the surface
area (580.0 m2/g) of the MW-irradiated SWCNTs is higher
than that of the pristine SWCNTs, which have a relatively low surface
area (375.4 m2/g). In light of these results, it can be
assumed that the increased ID/IG ratio in the Raman data originates from defects
formed on the SWCNT sidewalls. Notably, the MW irradiation process
generated a larger surface area and more mesopores by the formation
of defects (or holes) in the carbon-based materials. The role of the
defects in the SWCNT-based sensors will be discussed in detail, along
with that of n-ZnO NC functionalization, later.

(b) pore size distributions and BET specific
surface areas of the pristine SWCNTs and the MW-irradiated SWCNTs.

To evaluate the sensing performance
of the n-ZnO NC-functionalized,
defect-induced SWCNTs, sensing tests were performed for various gas
species such as NO2, SO2, CO, C2H5OH, and NH3 at room temperature. Note that NO2 and SO2 gas species were used as representative
oxidizing gases and CO, C2H5OH, and NH3 were chosen as reducing gases. In general, when carbon-based materials
showing p-type sensing behavior (such as graphene, GO, rGO, and SWCNT)
are exposed to oxidizing gases, a decrease in the sensor resistance
occurs because of the extraction of electrons from the valence band
of the carbon-based materials. In contrast, the exposure to reducing
gases increases the resistance in carbon-based materials. In the case
of n-type ZnO, the sensing behavior for oxidizing and reducing gases
is the reverse of that of the p-type carbon-based materials. To investigate
the relationship between the sensing performance of the defect-induced
SWCNTs and the amount of n-ZnO additive in particular, we systematically
tested the responses of the fabricated sensors to 5 ppm NO2 at room temperature. As shown in Figure 6a, the normalized NO2 response
of Z-SWCNTs is much higher than those of other sensors. Compared to
the pristine SWCNTs (Ra/Rg = 1.55), the responses to 5 ppm NO2 of 0.5Z-SWCNTs
and Z-SWCNTs increased to 2.22 and 7.14, respectively. Interestingly,
however, the responses of 2Z-SWCNTs (Ra/Rg = 1.5) and 3Z-SWCNTs (Ra/Rg = 1.45) deteriorated
in comparison to that of the pristine SWCNTs. These results show that
the NO2 response of SWCNT-based sensors used in this study
can be changed with the configuration of loaded ZnO NCs. As shown
in Figure 2, in the
case of the discrete ZnO NC-loaded SWCNTs (0.5Z-SWCNTs and Z-SWCNTs),
the NO2 response was significantly improved in comparison
with the pristine SWCNTs. By contrast, in the case of continuous ZnO
NC-loaded SWCNTs (2Z-SWCNTs and 3Z-SWCNTs), when the sensors were
exposed to NO2 gas molecules, the NO2 response
considerably deteriorated due to the variation of electrical charge
flow. In other words, the NO2 response of SWCNTs can be
improved via the optimized geometric configuration of ZnO NCs, resulting
in the maximized catalytic effect in the NO2 detection
of SWCNT-based sensors. The detailed sensing mechanism relevant to
the ZnO configuration will be discussed. Based on these results, all
sensing measurements were performed with the Z-SWCNT sensor. To estimate
the sensing behavior of the Z-SWCNTs in a practical NO2 gas sensor, the responses of the sensor were measured under various
NO2 concentrations at room temperature. The results are
summarized in Figure 6b–d. The resistance value of the fabricated sensor decreased
immediately when the sensor was exposed to NO2 gas. When
the supply of NO2 was stopped but the supply of air was
continued, the dropped resistance recovered to its initial value.
This behavior, as shown in Figure 6b, is commonly observed in p-type semiconducting gas
sensors. Therefore, the sensing behavior of the fabricated sensor
can be explained on the basis of a p-type semiconductor. This p-type
sensing behavior also suggests that the conduction path in ZnO–SWCNT
systems mostly occurs through the p-type SWCNTs, not the n-type ZnO.
As shown in Figure 6c, the NO2 responses of Z-SWCNTs are summarized as a function
of the NO2 concentration. The NO2 detection
ability obtained in this study was as low as 1 ppm, whereas the NO2 response was as high as 5.03 at 1 ppm. Thus, the Z-SWCNT
sample is a promising sensing material with potential applications
in gas sensors. Moreover, the linearity and theoretical detection
limit (DL) value of the Z-SWCNTs were calculated using a linear extrapolation
method. The calculated DL value for NO2 gas was approximately
88 ppb, which indicates that the Z-SWCNTs could be used to detect
NO2 gas concentrations at the sub-ppm level at room temperature.
For the calculation of the DL value, the noise level and slope values
were theoretically derived from its experimental data utilizing the
signal processing method suggested by Li et al.26 A detailed explanation regarding the theoretical DL value
is given in Figure S3 and Table S1. We
also measured the response and recovery times of the Z-SWCNT sensor,
and the results are shown in Figure 6d. The response times increased from 200 to 220 s with
increasing NO2 concentration in the range of 1–5
ppm, whereas the recovery times decreased from 390 to 385 s with increasing
NO2 concentration in the range of 1–5 ppm. Notably,
the Z-SWCNT sensor showed a relatively reversible sensing behavior
and stable NO2 response at room temperature.

as a function of NO2 concentration, and (d) response and
recovery times of Z-SWCNTs in the range of 1–5 ppm NO2.

The selectivity of a gas sensor
is one of the major factors that
can be used to evaluate its practical applicability. Therefore, to
assess the selectivity of the Z-SWCNT sensor, the gas responses of
the sensor were measured for 5 ppm SO2, CO, C2H5OH, and NH3 gases at room temperature. Figure 7a–d shows
the dynamic response curves of the Z-SWCNT sensor for 5 ppm SO2, CO, C2H5OH, and NH3, respectively,
over three successive cycles at room temperature. As shown in Figure 7a–d, the Z-SWCNT
sensor showed a stable response and reversible recovery for oxidizing
(5 ppm SO2) and reducing gases (5 ppm CO, C2H5OH, and NH3). Figure 7e summarizes the responses estimated from
the response curves, demonstrating that the NO2 selectivity
of the p-type SWCNTs (p-SWCNTs) can be enhanced by both functionalization
with n-ZnO NCs and defect formation. In addition, to confirm the superiority
of the Z-SWCNT sensor, the NO2-sensing performance of the
fabricated sensor was compared to those of previous reports (Table S2). Although the Z-SWCNT sensor did not
show the highest NO2 response when considering the NO2 concentration (1 ppm) and operating temperature (25 °C),
the present sensor showed the best NO2-sensing performance.

Furthermore, the long-term stability
of the Z-SWCNT sensor and
the effect of relative humidity on its performance were also investigated.
To demonstrate the stability and the repeatability of the sensor used
in this study, a sensor, stored under atmosphere conditions, was exposed
to 5 ppm NO2 for about 3 and 6 months after preparation.
As shown in Figure S4a, after 3 months,
the initial response value of the Z-SWCNT sensor was maintained, although
a slight difference of approximately 1% was noted. Furthermore, even
after 6 months, only a small deterioration (approximately 3%) in comparison
to that of the fresh sample was noted. Therefore, considering the
length of the storage period under atmosphere conditions and the small
difference in the response value after this time, the Z-SWCNT sensor
has good stability and repeatability. However, the effect of humidity
on the gas response is also a critical factor in the practical application
of semiconductor gas sensors. To investigate the NO2 response
of the Z-SWCNTs under humid conditions, we tested the NO2-sensing performance with humid air of 54 and 79% relative humidity
(RH), as shown in Figure S4b. The responses
of the Z-SWCNTs for 5 ppm NO2 were drastically degraded
at RH 54 and 79% in comparison to that in dry air. This result reveals
that the humidity has a negative effect on the NO2-sensing
performance of the Z-SWCNT sensors. In other words, when NO2 molecules and oxygen approach the surface of the sensing material,
water vapor in humid air prevents the adsorption of the target gas
molecules, leading to the degradation of the sensor performance in
humid conditions.

The significantly enhanced response for NO2 observed
in n-ZnO NC-functionalized, defect-induced SWCNT systems, especially
Z-SWCNTs, in this study can be interpreted on the basis of the following
features: the ZnO-SWCNT n–p junction framework,27,28 the distribution of the ZnO NCs on the SWCNTs,29,30 and the cofunctionalization of catalytic ZnO and defects on the
SWCNT sidewalls.

As shown in Figure S5, the n–p
heterointerface created between ZnO and SWCNTs can be understood by
comparing the initial resistance of each sensor prepared in this study.
Compared to the initial resistance of the pristine SWCNTs (approximately
4 × 103 Ω), those of the 0.5Z-SWCNTs and the
Z-SWCNTs increased to approximately 2 × 104 and 5
× 104 Ω at room temperature, respectively. Because
resistive n–p junctions are created at the interfaces between
the n-ZnO NCs and p-SWCNTs, charge carrier (electron) transfer occurs
from the n-ZnO to p-SWCNTs. Hence, the conducting channels in the
p-SWCNTs become narrow in the radial direction because the p-SWCNTs
are hole conducting sensing material.31 At this stage, the SWCNTs became highly sensitive to oxidizing gases
such as NO2 because of the suppressed conduction channel
under the SWCNT surface. On the other hand, the initial resistance
values of 2Z-SWCNTs and 3Z-SWCNTs were reduced to approximately 4.2
× 103 and 2 × 103 Ω, respectively.
The initial resistance values of the SWCNTs functionalized with varying
amounts of ZnO additives are shown in Figure S5f. The severe decrease in the initial resistance value of 2Z-SWCNTs
is attributed to the configuration of the ZnO NCs on the SWCNTs. As
shown in the insets of Figure S5a–e, the ZnO NCs were agglomerated in the 2Z-SWCNT sample (inset of Figure S5d) and partially covered the surfaces
of the SWCNTs in the 3Z-SWCNT sample (inset of Figure S5e). Hence, electrical transport will occur from the
SWCNTs to ZnO, resulting in the deterioration of the NO2 response. Therefore, to obtain the best sensing capabilities in
the n-ZnO NC-functionalized, defect-induced SWCNTs, optimization of
the amount of ZnO additives is one of the key control parameters.

The improved sensing of the Z-SWCNTs to NO2 gas molecules
was interpreted with respect to proposed sensing mechanisms related
to the cofunctionalization of the catalytic ZnO NCs and defects, as
follows. Figure 8 shows
a schematic diagram illustrating four sensing mechanisms for the exposure
of Z-SWCNTs to NO2 molecules. In the first mechanism, the
formation of defects on the surface of the SWCNTs makes the sensing
material more sensitive to the target gas, providing active sites
for gas adsorption and the passage of gas (diffusion). In other words,
the dangling bonds created by defect formation will be likely to react
with NO2, and gas molecules smaller than the size of defects
can approach the inner nanospace of the SWCNTs easily (denoted M1 in Figure 8). It should be of note that the amount of defects (or holes) in
SWCNTs has a great influence on the NO2 response. Detailed
experiment results with respect to this will be reported at a later
time.

Figure 8 Schematic diagram illustrating the four possible sensing mechanisms
in the n-ZnO NC-functionalized, defect-induced SWCNTs.

In the second mechanism, denoted M2 in Figure 8, the conducting
channel in
the Z-SWCNTs locally suppressed by the n–p heterointerface
is favorable for the detection of oxidizing gases, such as NO2, SO2, and O2. Because of the creation
of a heterointerface between n-ZnO and p-SWCNTs, electron flow occurs
from the n to p material until the Fermi level of ZnO equilibrates
with that of the SWCNT, eventually resulting in an increase in the
resistivity. This phenomenon will cause electron–hole compensation
underneath the n–p heterointerface by reducing the hole concentration
in the p-SWCNTs. Thus, the conducting channel in the Z-SWCNTs will
be narrower than that of pristine p-SWCNTs. In this state, when the
oxidizing gases are introduced, the conducting channel further expands
compared to the pristine p-SWCNTs because oxidizing gases extract
electrons from the valence band of the p-SWCNTs.

The third sensing
mechanism, denoted M3, is based on
the catalytic effect of the ZnO and the potential barrier mechanism.
Nanosized materials such as nanodots, nanoparticles, and NCs can act
as catalysts, dissociating target gas molecules, which are then transferred
to the surface of the sensing material. In particular, ZnO is well
known as a catalyst that can dissociate NO2 molecules by
means of chemical sensitization followed by the spillover of the dissociated
gas molecules onto the SWCNT surfaces.32 Furthermore, the potential barriers at the n-ZnO/p-SWCNT heterointerfaces
are modulated by the introduction of NO2 molecules. When
the Z-SWCNTs were exposed to the NO2 gas, the NO2 molecules adsorbed to the surface of not only the SWCNTs but also
the ZnO NCs. The NO2 molecules adsorbed on the surface
of the ZnO NCs will extract electrons from the conduction band of
ZnO, finally leading to an interface depletion layer. Accordingly,
holes, as the major carriers, can efficiently flow in the conducting
channel of the SWCNTs because electrons cannot easily move from the
ZnO NCs to the SWCNTs. Because the SWCNTs are a hole conducting sensing
material, this contributes to the improvement of the NO2 response in the Z-SWCNTs.

As mentioned previously, the optimized
configuration of the ZnO
NCs has a great influence on the sensing performance of the SWCNT
sensors. As shown in the schematic denoted M4, the exceptionally
enhanced NO2 response of the Z-SWCNTs is related to the
charge carrier (hole) flow, which is dependent on the configuration
of the loaded ZnO NCs. In the case of the functionalization of ZnO
NCs in a discrete manner, when the sample is exposed to oxidizing
gases such as NO2 molecules, charge carrier flow is expected
solely through the SWCNTs, exhibiting direct charge transfer between
NO2 molecules and the SWCNT sidewalls. In contrast, in
the case of the continuous configuration of ZnO NCs, the electrical
flow of charge carriers mainly occurs not along the SWCNTs but along
the ZnO NCs in a continuous manner. This is due to the SWCNT–ZnO–SWCNT
junctions formed in the interstitial space between SWCNTs. According
to a previous report,33 compared to individual
SWCNTs, charge carrier transfer can be promoted in a networked SWCNT
structure by a hopping mechanism. Therefore, the formation of continuous
ZnO NCs between SWCNTs can hinder the hopping conduction, resulting
in a marginal resistance variation. Note that the optimized geometric
configuration of ZnO NCs significantly affects the NO2 response
with respect to charge carrier flow.

In short, in the SWCNT-based
sensors, the maximized surface area,
electronic and catalytic sensitization, and optimized configuration
of the additive can lead to significantly enhanced gas-sensing performance.
In addition, further detailed investigation concerning the humidity
dependence is needed to implement reliable room-temperature NO2 gas sensors.

3 Conclusions
We realized
highly sensitive and selective NO2 sensors
based on networked SWCNT mats cofunctionalized with defects and ZnO
NCs, particularly via the modulation of the conduction channel in
the SWCNTs. The defects and ZnO NCs were synthesized simultaneously
by a microwave-assisted method and adjusted by varying the amount
of ZnO additives. The defect and ZnO NC cofunctionalization under
optimum conditions significantly improved the ability of the SWCNTs
to detect NO2 with respect to response and selectivity.
In addition, it seems that the enhanced NO2 sensing induced
by the microwave-assisted method is mainly attributed to the formation
of defects and the creation of n–p heterojunctions at the interfaces
between the n-ZnO NCs and the p-SWCNTs. This study demonstrates the
advantages of the microwave-assisted method as low cost, easy to use,
and efficient strategy for improving the gas-sensing performance of
SWCNT-based gas sensors.

4 Experimental Section
The commercial SWCNT film and ZnO nanopowder (particle diameter
< 100 nm) were purchased from NanoIntegris and Sigma Aldrich Corp.,
respectively. The SWCNT film (1 mg) was uniformly dispersed in 100
mL of ethanol by ultrasonication treatment for 4 h to obtain an SWCNT
colloid solution. We prepared a ZnO–SWCNT mixed solution by
adding the ZnO nanopowder to the SWCNT colloid solution in ZnO/SWCNT
weight ratios of 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1. Hereinafter, for simplicity,
the ZnO NC–SWCNT composites prepared by weight fractions of
ZnO and SWCNTs (ZnO/SWCNTs = 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1) will be denoted
0.5Z-SWCNTs, Z-SWCNTs, 2Z-SWCNTs, and 3Z-SWCNTs, respectively. The
mixed solutions were then filtered by an aspirator to collect uniform
ZnO–SWCNT mixed powders. Then, to synthesize n-ZnO NC-functionalized,
defect-induced SWCNTs, the collected mixed powders were loaded in
an alumina crucible and heated for 5 min in a 1 kW microwave oven
(LG Electronics, Model LGMM-M301) with a frequency of 2.45 GHz. The
microwave-treated ZnO–SWCNT mixed powders were then dispersed
in 50 mL of 1,2-dichlorobenzene (C6H4Cl2, Sigma Aldrich Corp.). Finally, to fabricate the sensor devices,
the mixed powders dispersed in 1,2-dichlorobenzene were sprayed onto
SiO2/Si substrates that were placed on a hot plate heated
to 180 °C. The detailed fabrication process of the n-ZnO NC-functionalized,
defect-induced SWCNT sensors is shown schematically in Figure 1.

The morphology of the
synthesized samples was characterized using
a field-emission scanning microscope (FE-SEM, FEI Nova-SEM) and a
transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL TEM 2100F) operating at
200 kV. In addition, the components, phases, and chemical states of
the samples were analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry
(EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max-2500 PC), and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo K-Alpha). We measured the defect densities
of the pristine and MW-irradiated SWCNTs using Raman spectra obtained
using a BRUKER RFS 100/S by 1064 nm excitation from a neodymium-doped
yttrium aluminum garnet laser. We also carried out the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET, Tristar, ASAP 2020) analysis to measure the surface areas of
the pristine and the MW-irradiated SWCNTs.

For gas-sensing measurements,
electrodes consisting of a Ti layer
(50 nm thick) and a Au layer (200 nm thick) were deposited as interdigitated
electrodes (IDEs) on the synthesized samples by a sputtering technique.
The detailed configuration of the IDEs and the purpose of their use
for the Ti layer are presented in our previous reports.21,22 The gas concentrations in this study were controlled by changing
the mixing ratio of the air-balanced target gases to dry air. For
precise control of the gas concentration, a mass flow controller was
used, and the total gas flow was fixed to 500 sccm to avoid any variation
during the sensing measurements. All measurements were carried out
in a specially designed quartz chamber at room temperature (25 °C).
The response value (R) of sensors was defined as R = Ra/Rg (oxidizing gas) and R = Rg/Ra (reducing gas), where Ra and Rg are the
resistance values in the absence and presence of the target gases,
respectively. The response and recovery times were calculated as the
time needed to reach 90% of the final resistance value after supplying
the target gas and the time needed to recover 90% of the initial resistance
after stopping the target gas, respectively.
