Here, we demonstrate the novel double-component
liquid crystalline
colloids composed of mesogenic inorganic nanosheets and the rods with
dynamically variable length controlled by temperature. As the length-controllable
rod, stiff biopolymer microtubule is used, which was successfully
polymerized/depolymerized from tubulin proteins through a biochemical
process even in the presence of the nanosheets. The mesoscopic structure
of the liquid crystal phase was reversibly modifiable as caused by
the change of the rod length.

Introduction
Anisotropic and hierarchical
structures composed of inorganic and
organic nanocomponents, such as abalone shell (protein + calcium carbonate)
and human body (muscle + bone), are key components for sophisticated
functions of living organisms.1 The complex
architectures of living organisms are assembled through consumption
of energy and exchange of molecules. Inspired by living systems, many
kinds of artificial materials with regulated superstructures and functions
have been fabricated by controlling electrostatic force, hydrogen
bond, van der Waals interactions, and coordination bond: DNA-origami,2 mesophases of liquid crystals (LCs), surfactant
micelles, and metal–organic-framework3 are old and new examples. In addition to those interactions, entropic
interactions are also important to regulate the assembly of the nanocomponents.
Prominent examples are the ordered structures found in colloidal systems4 such as colloid crystals and colloidal LCs.5 Further, combination of components with dissimilar
morphologies such as rod/plate,6 rod/sphere,7 plate/sphere,8 nanosheet/rod,9 nanosheet/nanosheet,10 and plate/polymer11 types of particles
also facilitates formation of variety of well-ordered structures.
Thus, complexity of the system is a key to develop highly organized
and hierarchical structures.

Herein, we demonstrate a new type
double-component colloidal system
composed of two types of colloidal LC mesogens (Scheme 1): one is a thin platy particle and the other
is a rigid hollow rod with the length reversibly controllable in situ
in response to temperature. As the platy particle, we use inorganic
nanosheets obtained by exfoliation of a layered clay mineral fluorohectorite
(FHT).12 Among several kinds of anisotropic
particles, nanosheets13,14 are distinguished by the ultralarge
anisotropy and 2D shape: uniform thickness of ca. 1 nm and the lateral
size of up to 100 μm. Because of the large anisotropy, the LC
phase is formed at very low concentration as low as <0.2 wt %.15,16 Many applications of liquid crystalline nanosheets for anisotropic
composite gel,17 fibers,18 optical devices,19 and anisotropic
medium for spectroscopy20 have been investigated.
High biocompatibility of clay nanosheets21 allows us to choose a living biopolymer, microtubule (MT), as the
counterpart. A MT is a hollow rod with a diameter of 25 nm, length
of up to several tens of μm, and high rigidity (the persistent
length on the order of millimeters).22,23 The MT is
actively formed by polymerization of tubulin dimers (TBs) through
a biochemical reaction that consume biochemical energy obtained from
hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) at ∼37 °C,
whereas it reversibly dissociates to TBs by cooling. Because of the
large excluded volume of the rigid hollow tube, the solution of MTs
forms a nematic LC phase. Organization of MTs into well-defined structure
is valuable for future applications as artificial muscles, sorting
devices, and biosensors. The present system will not only give new
insights into mixed colloidal systems controlled by entropic interactions
but also lead to various active molecular devices of which structures
are hierarchically regulated both by mesogenic nanosheets and MT rods.

Scheme 1 Overview of This Study
Results and Discussion
FHT and MT were uniformly mixed
and polymerization/depolymerization
of the MT proceeded without being disturbed by the presence of nanosheets.
The single-component colloids of FHT (2 wt %) (Figure 1a) and MT (120 μM) (Figure 1b) showed permanent birefringence
because of the LC phase in which nanosheets12 or MTs are oriented.25 Because of the
flow of the sample when it was introduced into the capillary, the
optical axis is preferentially oriented along the capillary wall.
No specific textures like Schlieren texture were observed. The double-component
system containing both FHT and MT (Figure 1c) showed a birefringent image similar to
the single-component FHT system. It is notable that we did not observe
phase separation or aggregation of the nanosheets, confirming that
the two components are mixed homogeneously. Generally, in double-component
colloidal liquid crystalline systems, macroscopic phase separations
are observed after storing the sample for sufficiently long time26 or by centrifugation,27 which is valuable to investigate the system more in detail. However,
this phenomenon was not observed in our system, although we stored
the sample up to 24 h; we cannot store the sample longer at the present
condition because the MT dissociate into TBs when GTP is exhausted.
Gravity-induced sedimentation also sometimes prevents us from clear
observation of the phase separation.

solution, (c) as prepared
FHT/MT mixture (37 °C), and (d) FHT/TB mixture after cooling
(4 °C). FHT concentration is 2 wt % and TB concentration is 120
μM.

The birefringence was weakened
when the double-component sample
was cooled at 4 °C for 30 min (Figure 1d). This indicates depolymerization of MTs
to TBs. The birefringence of the double-component system was weaker
than the single-component nanosheet colloid containing same concentration
of the nanosheet, suggesting that TBs interact with the nanosheets
and partly disturbed the formation of the LC phase of the nanosheets.

Effects of the concentrations of FHT and MT were then examined. Figure 2 shows the polarized
optical microscopy (POM) images of the solutions containing various
concentrations of FHT and MT. Single-component FHT systems showed
the LC phase at above 1 wt %, and the birefringence increased with
increasing FHT concentration. They did not show temperature dependence.
Meanwhile, the single-component MT system showed an LC phase at above
90 μM, and birefringence increased with increase in MT concentration.
In the double-component system, stronger birefringence was observed
at higher MT or FHT concentrations. The samples containing the MT
showed response to temperature with or without nanosheets.

observation was made (a) as-prepared (37 °C), (b) after cooling
(4 °C), and (c) after heating again (37 °C).

Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements
revealed the structural
change on the mesoscale induced by temperature change, corresponding
to the macroscopic change observed by POM. The profile of the MT solution
(Figure 3a) agrees
with the theoretical form factor28 shown
as eq 1 (Figure 3a′) of a hollow cylinder
with the outer and inner diameters of 29 and 21 nm, respectively. 1  where  Here, q is the scattering
vector, r is the core radius, r + t is the shell radius, L is the length
of the MT, Δρ is the scattering contrast between the core
and the shell, A is the factor related to the particle
volume and concentration, and J1 is the
first order Bessel function. This geometrical size corresponds to
MTs composed of 15 TBs in one lap, whereas it is known that the MTs
with various diameters are formed depending on the condition.29 The nanosheet colloid (Figure 3c) and mixture of the nanosheet and MT (Figure 3b) showed profiles
with the slope of q–2. This indicates
that most of the nanosheets are present as single layers because the
theoretical form factor (eq 2) (Figure 3c′) of the nanosheets is approximated as q–2 for nanosheets larger than 100 nm in the range
of q in the present measurement.30 2  

Figure 3 SAXS patterns
of (a) MT solution (from 75 μM of the TB),
(b) the mixture of FHT (4 wt %) and MT (from 75 μM of the TB),
and (c) FHT colloid (4 wt %). The theoretical form factors for (a′)
hollow cylinder and (c′) thin disk are also shown as dotted
lines.

Note that the profile in the double-component
system mainly reflects
the scattering from nanosheets because scattering capability of the
inorganic nanosheets is more than one order of magnitude higher than
MTs which is composed only of organic atoms.

From SAXS patterns,
the superstructures in double component colloids
were evaluated after eliminating the effect of the form factor. The
as-observed scattering profile I(q) is expressed as 3  where S(q) is the structure factor, P(q)
is the form factor, and A is the factor determined
by scattering power and number of the particles.

Because the
form factor P(q)
of the nanosheets is approximated as q–2, S(q) is calculated as S(q) = I(q)q2 with A = 1. As a
consequence, we show I(q)q–2 versus q plots in Figure 4 to discuss the structure
of the colloid. Single-component FHT colloids (Figure 4a) showed the peaks because of the structure
with the basal spacing d = 34.1 nm.12 Because the peaks are not so sharp, the LC phase is supposed
as the nematic phase with rather low positional order.31 In the double-component system of FHT and MT
(Figure 4b), the peak
is shifted to higher q (d = 13.1
nm).32 Although basal spacing significantly
changes by the salt effect (Figure S2),
we have adjusted the concentration of buffer constituents in all the
samples examined. Hence, the observed peak shift is explained that
the coexisting MTs deprive the free volume for nanosheets so that
the nanosheet LC phase was compressed. After cooling, the peak shifted
to lower q (d = 21.3 nm) again.
The temperature-triggered change is reversible, and the peak shifted
to higher q (d = 15.3 nm) after
heating again. The 2D-SAXS patterns (right side of Figure 4) are more or less anisotropic
for all cases, indicating the presence of anisotropic liquid crystalline
domains.

FHT/MT mixture (37 °C), (c) FHT/TB obtained by cooling FHT/MT
to 4 °C, and (d) FHT/MT mixture obtained by heating to 37 °C
again. Concentrations of FHT and MT/TB are 4 wt % and 75 μM
of TB, respectively.

Structural formation in response to temperature found in
the double-component
system is driven by entropic interactions explained based on Onsager
theory.33 Onsager theory considers hard
core repulsive force between the cylindrical particles
(D ≫ L is disk or D ≪ L is rod) of diameter D and length L. The particles occupy considerably
larger excluded volume b as compared with their own
actual volume vp (=πD2L/4) when the anisotropic particles
are freely rotating. The b/vp is calculated by the following equation 4  

When the sum of the excluded volume b becomes
larger than a certain value, the particles cannot keep free rotation
so that the LC phase is formed. It has been reported so far that the
formation of the LC phase of nanosheet colloids can roughly be explained
by this theory.34,35 Because both FHT nanosheets and
MTs are negatively charged, repulsive force is dominant in the system,
so that Onsager theory can be applied in this double-component system.
Usually, when treating with Onsager theory, electrostatic repulsion
between the charged particles is taken into account, for example,
by considering effective size of particles defined as the sum of the
size of the particle core and the additional size related to Debye
length and charge density. However, here, we ignore this effect because
ionic strength is adjusted at a high value (>0.2 M) and the high
ionic
strength screens the electrostatic interaction.

If the MT is
regarded as a cylinder with DMT = 29 nm
and LMT = 104 nm, the excluded
volume b per one MT unit is calculated
as 2.5 × 109 nm3 from eq 4. Meanwhile, b for one TB
dimer is 5.5 × 102 nm3 if we model the
dimer as a cylinder with DTB = 4 nm and LTB = 8 nm. The number of dimers consisting one
MT is calculated as LMT/8 × 15 =
1.9 × 104, considering that the dimer is 8 nm in height,
and there are 15 dimers per lap. Thus, when one MT is cooled and dissociates
into TBs, the total excluded volume reduces to (1.9 × 104) × (5.5 × 102) = 1.0 × 107 nm3, that is 250 times smaller than the value for the
MT. Therefore, when TBs polymerize to MTs, the free volume for nanosheets
is largely deprived. Considering the SAXS result that the spacing
between the nanosheets in the double-component system is smaller than
the diameter of the MT (29 nm), MTs cannot be present between the
nanosheets forming the LC phase. This indicates that nanosheets and
MTs are forming separated LC domains although they seem to be homogeneously
mixed on the macroscopic scale as observed by POM. The decrease in
the basal spacing in the double-component system compared to the single-component
FHT colloid is ascribable to the compression of the LC phase of the
nanosheet by coexisting MTs.

Conclusions
FHT and MT were mixed
uniformly, and biochemical polymerization/depolymerization
of the MT proceeded without being disturbed by the presence of nanosheets.
The present system is highlighted as the first system that nanosheets
are mixed with rods that reversibly change their length triggered
by external factors. Such a system will be a good model system for
fundamental studies of anisotropic colloidal systems composed of multiple
mesogenic components. Because MTs constitute the molecular motor system
with kinesin, the present system will be further developed as a new
molecular motor system or artificial muscle with a hierarchical ordered
structure formed by synergy of mesogenic nanosheets and biological
MTs.

Experimental Section
The liquid crystalline nanosheet colloid
of synthetic FHT was prepared,
according to the previously reported process from NHT-B2 sol supplied
from Topy Industries.12 This colloidal
solution was diluted with pure water to 2 wt %. The average particle
size of the nanosheets was 1.2 μm with a standard deviation
of 0.14 μm as confirmed by dynamic light scattering (Figure S1). The TB was extracted and purified
from porcine brain according to the previously reported process,24 using an aqueous buffer solution (pH 6.8) containing
1 M of 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid (PIPES), 20 mM of ethylene
glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), and 10 mM of MgCl2. To
polymerize the TB to MT, the TB solution was added with GTP and dimethylsulfoxide
(the final concentrations are 0.1 mM and 5 vol %, respectively) and
incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The nanosheet colloid and MT solution
were mixed at various ratios to obtain the samples for evaluation.
For all samples, including the single-component FHT colloid, the concentrations
of the buffer constituents were adjusted to 0.08 M of PIPES, 0.001
M of EGTA, and 0.001 M of MgCl2 for the POM observation
(Nikon ECLIPSE LV100POL), the samples were sealed in a glass capillary.
Structural analyses by SAXS were performed with the Bruker NANOSTAR
(Cu Kα radiation at 30 V and 40 mA) with a camera distance of
1070 mm or with the Rigaku NANOPIX (Cu Kα radiation at 30 V
and 40 mA) with a camera distance of 750 mm. For SAXS measurements,
the samples were introduced into a thin glass capillary or a cell
with a thickness of 1.5 mm. The SAXS and POM observations were conducted
under a controlled temperature of 4 or 37 °C.

Although the concentrations were adjusted
to exactly the same, the peak position in Figures 3b and 4b are different
because these samples were prepared from different batch of tubulin
purified on different date. Because the present system is a biochemical
system, the obtained data largely depend on the sample batch.
