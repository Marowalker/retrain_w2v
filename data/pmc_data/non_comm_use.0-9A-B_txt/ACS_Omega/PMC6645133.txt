An application of
a charge of the substituent active region concept
to 1-Y,4-X-disubstituted derivatives of bicyclo[2.2.2]octane (BCO)
[where Y = NO2, COOH, OH, and NH2 and X = NMe2, NH2, OH, OMe, Me, H, F, Cl, CF3, CN,
CHO, COMe, CONH2, COOH, NO2, and NO] provides
a quantitative information on the inductive component of the substituent
effect (SE). It is shown that the effect is highly additive but dependent
on the kind of substituents. An application of the SE stabilization
energy characteristics to 1,4-disubstituted derivatives of BCO and
benzene allows the definition of inductive and resonance contributions
to the overall SE. Good agreements with empirical approaches are found.
All calculations have been carried out by means of the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)
method.

Introduction
The substituent effect
(SE) is one of the most fruitful and effective
concepts in organic chemistry and related fields of research. According
to ISI Web of Science,1 everyday there
appears at least one paper with this term in the title, keywords,
or in the abstract. An introduction of substituent constants (SCs)
by Hammett2,3 begins the development of ideas of quantitative
description of the SE. From the beginning, it has been found that
SCs based on the acid–base equilibria constants of substituted
benzoic acids are not of universal use.4 For reactions with negatively and positively charged reaction sites,
they had to be modified.5 The explanation
of these deviations from the original Hammett SCs was formulated by
Taft and Lewis.6,7 They assumed that the SE is composed
of two kinds of interactions: inductive and resonance. A separation
of them was based on the empirical hypothesis that SCs in the para position, σp, contain resonance and
inductive contributions in comparable amounts,8 as presented in eq 1.

 1  An application of the acid–base equilibrium
constants of
4-substituted derivatives of bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylic acids
allowed the definition of inductive SCs, σI.9 Then, by the use of eq 1, one can easily estimate σR. Additionally, it was assumed that the distance between X in position
4 in bicyclo[2.2.2]octane (BCO) and in p-substituted
benzoic acid derivatives is very similar, and hence, the inductive
effect is similar in both reference reaction series. A similar procedure
was applied by Swain and Lupton10 who generated
a table of SCs for ∼200 substituents, named F (for inductive/field) and R (for resonance), but
not presented in the scale of the original SC σ. The F and R values are now accessible in the
review5 and normalized to this scale.

In view of the above information, the classical Hammett equation,
defined originally for kinetic and equilibria data, may be modified
to the form of 2.8 Actually, lg K(k) is often replaced
by various physicochemical properties. 2  

Assuming
approximate constant values for σI, eq 1 may be applied for the
estimation of resonance constants for other kinds of SCs such as σ+ and σ– working for reaction series
with positively and negatively charged reaction sites, respectively.5 In all these cases, the final results depend
on a particular reference reaction and for systems in which interactions
defining the SE differ from these reactions, the estimation of resonance
SCs is not well-defined. It should also be mentioned that apart from
inductive (field) and resonance contributions, properties such as
polarization and electronegativity have also been taken into account.11

Till now, SCs are of a fundamental importance,
and they are applied
in countless studies in organic chemistry and related fields.5,12−14 In last decades, for describing SEs, many approaches
have been proposed in which various kinds of quantum chemistry models
are applied (see below). However, almost always the obtained data
have been confronted with the Hammett SCs or some of their modifications.
For example, successful correlations have been found between molecular
electrostatic potential of substituted benzene (BEN) and SCs15−17 or between electrostatic potential at a particular nucleus and resonance
and inductive SCs σR and σI, respectively.18 The molecular electrostatic potential was successfully
applied for the assessment of the inductive effect19 as well as for the characterization of the resonance effect.20 Moreover, in many cases, the application of
electrostatic potentials at the ring carbon atoms or at atoms of a
reaction site revealed their good correlation with SCs.21−23 Recently, some quantification and classification of the SE from
the view point of molecular electrostatic potential were published.24 SEs were also characterized using the calculated
gas-phase acidities of benzoic acid, phenol, and bicyclo[2,2,2]octane
derivatives.25−27 The energy decomposition analysis28 (EDA) was also used successfully in the SE studies. It
was shown that in the meta- and para-substituted benzylic cations and anions, the strength of the π
conjugation (EDA component) correlates well with SCs.29 The other very important issue of SE is its energetic characteristics,
named SESE (substituent effect stabilization energy), obtained through
the use of the isodesmic or homodesmotic reactions approach.30−32 It was demonstrated in many cases that SESE values correlate well
with SCs.33−35 Recently, it was documented that the sum of charges
at the substituent and the ipso carbon atom, named cSAR (charge of
the substituent active region),33−38 also correlates well with the Hammett SCs. Moreover, it is very
important to note that the values of cSAR(X) calculated by means of
various assessments of atomic charge are mutually well-correlated.39

The motivation of this paper is to present
the inductive and resonance
SEs in terms of physically defined descriptors as above-mentioned
SESE and cSAR characteristics. They describe independently the energetic
effects of the interaction between X and Y in X-R-Y reaction series
as well as changes in the electronic structure. For this purpose,
1,4-disubsituted derivatives of BCO and BEN are chosen. As shown in Scheme 1, two types of fixed
groups are considered: (i) electron-accepting (EA) NO2 and
COOH and (ii) electron-donating (ED) OH and NH2, as well
as a wide range of substituents (X) with different electronic properties.

Results and Discussion
For clarity, this section is divided into three subsections. Results
and Discussion dealing with pure inductive effects are presented in
the first two parts. They are based on the analysis of the changes
in the electronic structure of 1,4-disubstituted X-BCO-Y derivatives.
Our previous research on 1-X-BCO systems40 has already confirmed the usefulness of the cSAR concept for this
purpose. The presence of a second substituent allows both a deeper
analysis of the inductive effect (first part) as well as its additivity
(second part). The last (third) subsection is devoted to the inductive
and resonance SEs working together. Hence, both BCO and BEN disubstituted
series (derivatives) have to be investigated (the partial results
of the latter systems have recently been published35,41−43). For this purpose, the energetic characteristic
of the SE (SESE) is best suited because in this way all changes in
molecules are taken into account.

Inductive Substituent Effects
As
shown very recently,
dependences of cSAR(CH) or cSAR(CH2) on cSAR(X) for monosubstituted
1-X-BCO systems are linear, and moreover, their slopes fulfill the
ideal 1:2:3 ratio for groups in the 4, 3, and 2 positions.40 This is a typical relation assumed for the inductive
effect.44 The following question may be
posed: how cSAR(CH2) is affected by substituents X in 1,4-disubstituted
BCO derivatives with a fixed functional group Y in position 1 (4-X-BCO-1-Y).
It has been found that linear equations can be used to describe the
dependences of cSAR(CH2) on cSAR(X) or cSAR(Y) in all studied
cases.

Let us begin with an effect of substituent X on the vicinal
CH2 fragment. As shown in Figure 1, the relations of cSAR(CH2)[3] versus cSAR(X) have negative slopes which are ∼−0.185
with R2 > 0.94 for all Y-series. This
means that the SE of X on vicinal CH2 is almost the same
regardless of the type of the second substituent—the fixed
group Y. For a more distant CH2 fragment but closer to
a fixed group Y, the slopes are less steep and are in the range between
−0.109 and −0.116 with R2 > 0.898 (see Figure S1). Thus, the
inductive
SE of X becomes significantly weaker. For monosubstituted BCO derivatives40 (calculations performed using the same method),
the values of the slopes were found to be equal to −0.190 for
vicinal and −0.124 for more distant CH2 groups with
respect to X. A comparison of the above given slope values reveals
a similar weakening of the inductive SE of the substituent X by the
second substituent—the fixed group Y (NO2, COOH,
OH, and NH2). With respect to Y = H series, this weakening
is greater for more distant CH2 fragments than those closer
to X; in the latter case, this is ca. 2.5%, whereas for the former
one: 11.7 and 6.9% for EA and ED Y, respectively.

Figure 1 Dependence of cSAR(CH2)[3] (near X) on cSAR(X)
for 4-X-BCO-1-Y derivatives.

Thus, let us look at similar relationships but from the perspective
of a fixed group. In this case, the cSAR(CH2) variation
is considered to be influenced by Y whose properties are in turn dependent
on the SE from X. The dependences of cSAR(CH2) on cSAR(Y)
are also characteristic and, as expected, with positive slope values.
For the CH2 group closer to Y[(CH2)[2]], their slopes are in the range of 0.924 and 1.311, with R2 > 0.945 (Figure 2). However, two groups of Y series can be
distinguished: for the EA Y (NO2 and COOH), the average
value of the slopes is 0.950, whereas the average value is 1.265 for
the ED one (Y = OH and NH2).

Figure 2 Dependence of cSAR(CH2)[2] (near Y) on cSAR(Y)
for 4-X-BCO-1-Y derivatives.

The dependences of cSAR(CH2) in positions closer
to
X[(CH2)[3]] on cSAR(Y) characterize slopes in
the range from 1.427 to 1.819 and R2 >
0.768 (Figure S2). Again, two groups of
Y series should be noted. Average values of the slopes are 1.440 and
1.765 for EA and ED Y, respectively. The greater slope values than
that found for cSAR(CH2)[2] versus cSAR(Y) relations
confirm stronger SE from X. For Y = H series (monosubstituted BCO
derivatives),40 the slopes of cSAR(CH2)[2] or cSAR(CH2)[3] versus
cSAR(H) relations are equal to 2.089 and 2.865, respectively. Therefore,
for EA/ED Y, the obtained slopes are significantly smaller than that
found for monosubstituted BCO.

The strength of intramolecular
interactions between fixed Y groups
and substituents X can be characterized by dependences of cSAR(Y)
on cSAR(X), as shown in Figure 3. Their slopes are in the range between −0.088 and
−0.118 (with R2 > 0.923 for
all
Y’s), which suggests weak interactions between X and Y. However,
stronger interactions are for Y = NO2 and COOH with the
mean slope value −0.115 than that for Y = OH and NH2 with the mean value −0.091, whereas for Y = H, the slope
amounts −0.059.40 Note that for
cSAR(Y) versus cSAR(X) in disubstituted BEN derivatives, the slope
is ∼−0.35,35,41−43 that is, approximately 3 times the stronger interactions. This point
will be discussed in more detail later.

Figure 3 Dependence of cSAR(Y)
vs cSAR(X) for 1,4-disubstituted BCO derivatives.

The analysis of the dependence of cSAR(FRAG) (see Scheme 1) on cSAR(X) reveals
rather
low dependences (slopes between −0.886 and −0.910) but
a very high correlation (R2 > 0.997,
see Table S3). This confirms weak changes
in charges
of the BCO fragment and again weaker ones for ED fixed groups.

Additivity
of the Inductive Effect
The question of
additivity of the inductive effect is of fundamental importance. This
was studied for disubstituted BCO derivatives by the use of the appropriate
cSAR(CH2) data in monosubstituted BCO and X-BCO-Y systems.
Consider an example: for NH2-BCO-NO2 (Y = NO2 and X = NH2), its cSAR(CH2)[3] (equal to 0.0109, Table S2) should be
compared with the sum of cSAR(CH2)[3] in BCO-NO2 (0.0167) and cSAR(CH2)[2] in BCO-NH2 (−0.0068) (see Table S4), as presented in Scheme 2. Therefore, the additivity parameter, δ, in our example
reads as  

Scheme 2 Comparison of cSAR(CH2)[2] and
cSAR(CH2)[3] in Monosubstituted BCO and X-BCO-Y
Systems
When we look at the
values of δ for all studied systems (Table
S6 in the Supporting Information), we can
observe that the additivity parameter (δ values) decreases in
line with a decrease of EA (and increase of ED) properties of substituents.
This means that the additivity of inductive effects operating in X-BCO-Y
systems is better realized for EA fixed groups (NO2 and
COOH) than for the ED ones (OH and NH2) (Table S6 in the Supporting Information). A direct inspection
of the data in Table S6 discloses that
numerical characteristics of additivity, δ, are very small numbers,
at the level of 10–3 electron. When such small numbers
are taken for calculating % value of additivity, then for many individual
cases, this percentage can become very large—even up to ∼1000%
(Tables S7 and S8). For this purpose, instead
of an application of individual values of cSAR(CH2)[2] and cSAR(CH2)[3] in monosubstituted
BCO and X-BCO-Y systems, for calculating additivity descriptor δ
in terms of percentage, only the averaged values for all substituents
were taken from Tables S2, S5, and S6. Table 1 presents the obtained
data and the final results—the percentage of the additivity.
A very interesting problem is worth a deeper discussion: there are
substantial differences between averaged percentages of the additivity,
δ/cSAR(CH2), in positions 2 and 3 as well as for
the EA and ED properties of the fixed groups, Y. Hence, the additivity
parameter δ for EA groups (NO2 and COOH) is smaller
than that for ED groups (OH and NH2). Moreover, the additivity
is better disclosed for CH2 closer to the substituents
X than that closer to the fixed group.

δ/cSAR(CH2)/%	5.3	8.1	30.3	100	1.8	11.8	13.9	24.1	
One more problem worth a discussion is the difference between the
averaged values of cSAR(CH2) in positions 2 and 3 for Y
EA and ED fixed groups. In the first case, the sum of cSAR(CH2)[3] for NO2 and COOH for all X is equal
to 0.0361, whereas that for NH2 and OH is 0.0194 (Table
S2 in the Supporting Information). As could
be expected, CH2 groups lose more negative charge because
of the interactions with EA groups than with the ED ones. A similar
effect is observed for the CH2 group near Y, with the appropriate
values 0.0384 and 0.0105 (Table S2 in the Supporting Information). A very similar effect was observed for substituted
methyl—the sEDA descriptor was decreasing with a decrease of
EA (and then increase of ED) properties of substituents.45

Inductive and Resonance Effects Working Together
As
presented in the previous subsection, the inductive SE is realized
in aliphatic, that is, sigma-electron systems. The situation is different
in pi-electron systems, where apart from the inductive effects, the
resonance effects are also present. For illustrating these differences,
SESE values for all substituents X estimated for X-BCO-Y and X-BEN-Y
systems are presented in Table 2. Approximately, the differences in SESE(X) for BEN and BCO
series, ΔSESE, for a given Y may be interpreted as a result
of the resonance effect for a particular X-BEN-Y system. It is worth
to emphasize that (i) for different Ys, both BEN and BCO derivatives
have different SESE(X) values, and (ii) SESEBEN values
are mostly greater (as absolute values) than SESEBCO and
the only exceptions are X = F and Cl. Furthermore, in BEN series,
the greatest SESE values (as absolute values) are for X and Y with
strong EA or ED properties, and stabilization is observed when Y and
X are of opposite EA/ED properties. Moreover, besides the case of para-NMe2-BCO-COOH, SESEs for BCO series have
negative values always. This indicates that inductive interactions
between X and Y in X-BCO-Y series decrease the stability of the systems
in comparison with separated monosubstituted BCO derivatives. The
strongest destabilization is observed for the cases when both X and
Y are EA substituents. This is not the case for para-substituted X-BEN-Y derivatives where SESE values are positive when
Y and X are of opposite electron properties. The variabilities of
SESE values of BCO and BEN series estimated by ratios of estimated
standard deviation (ESD) values are 0.345 (Y = NO2), 0.224
(COOH), 0.214 (OH), and 0.067 (NH2). It is important to
note that ESD for BEN series changes between 1.45 and 2.41, whereas
that for BCO series changes between 0.15 and 0.83. Interestingly,
the variability for BCO series decreases with an increase of the ED
properties of Y.

When COOH series
are chosen as a reference (SCs were obtained based
on the properties of the carboxylic group in benzoic acids and BCO-COOH
derivatives),2,9 then the resonance contribution
to SEs and ΔSESE for NO2, OH, and NH2 systems
plotted versus ΔSESECOOH results in well-correlated
lines with R2 > 0.900 (Figure 4). Important to note that for
the NO2 group, the slope is positive (and has high R2 = 0.995), which can be explained by similar
properties of the fixed groups (NO2 and COOH are both EA
groups). In the case of ED functional groups, OH and NH2, the slopes are negative and the precision of regression lines is
slightly lower with R2 equal to 0.93 and
0.90, respectively.

Figure 4 Dependence of ΔSESENO2;OH;NH2 vs ΔSESECOOH for disubstituted BEN
and BCO derivatives
(a). Plots for X EA and ED are separated (b); ΔSESE in kcal/mol.

However, the scatter plot (the
distribution of the points) for
the latter series suggests a splitting of the substituents into two
groups. If the regressions for Y = OH and NH2 series are
done separately for EA and ED substituents, it appears that the slopes
for EA substituents are −3.39 (Y = NH2) and −2.14
(Y = OH), that is, they are much greater (as absolute values) than
the slopes obtained for all substituents. For ED substituents, the
slopes are less steep and amount to −0.97 and −0.77,
for NH2 and OH, respectively. In all cases, R2 > 0.862. These effects reveal how strongly the resonance
effect is dependent on EA/ED properties of X and the nature of Y.

Figure 5 presents
linear dependences of SESEBCO (inductive effect), SESEBEN (inductive and resonance effects), and ΔSESE (resonance
effect) on F, σp, and R constants, respectively. Despite different sensitivities and a character
of the variability of SESEBCO, SESEBEN, and
ΔSESE values, their dependences on empirical constants F, σp, and R are either
very good (SESEBEN and ΔSESE) or at least acceptable
for SESEBCO versus F. This is not only
a mutual verification of empirical characteristics by theoretical
modeling but also a justification of using SESE as a valuable descriptor
of the above-mentioned SEs.

Figure 5 Dependences of SESEBCO, SESEBEN, and ΔSESE
for Y = NO2, COOH, OH, and NH2 on SCs (a) F, (b) σp, and (c) R,
respectively; SESE and ΔSESE in kcal/mol.

The regressions presented in Figure 5a reveal very important properties of the
inductive
effects:(i) as expected, the inductive effect
estimated by the use of the SESE approach for X-BCO-Y series depends
clearly on the nature of a substituent X and correlates well with
empirical constant F;

(ii) in all cases, except for X = NMe2, SESE
values are negative, it means that X···Y
interactions are destabilizing in comparison with separated monosubstituted
systems; and

(iii) the
more EA (and less ED) Y, the
stronger interactions between X and Y (the more negative slope) and
a greater range of the variation of SESE values (Table 2).



The dependences of SESE on σp values for X-BEN-Y
series, shown in Figure 5b, disclose a very clear difference for the series with EA and ED
functional groups, that is, COOH and NO2 on the one hand
and OH and NH2 on the another hand. In the first case,
the slopes are negative, indicating the destabilizing effect of EA
substituents, whereas in the second case, the EA substituents stabilize
X-BEN-Y systems.

Finally, the use of the ΔSESE concept
to characterize the
resonance effect of a substituent, R, in all systems
studied (Y = NO2, COOH, OH, and NH2) is shown
in Figure 5c. The obtained
relationships between ΔSESE and R reveal symptoms
similar to those for σ (σp are used), presented
in Figure 5b. In both
cases, the stronger interactions between X and Y are observed for
the series with the most EA (NO2) and ED (NH2) fixed groups, documented by the slope values as well as by the
ranges of variation of SESE and ΔSESE values (Table 2). The mean SESE values for
BEN series increase with a decrease of EA (an increase of ED) properties
of the fixed group: for NO2, COOH, OH, and NH2, the values are −0.72, −0.19, −0.03, and 0.55,
respectively (Table 2).

A more general view is found while looking at the data in Table 3. Two important differences
have to be indicated. The first one, the ranges for BCO series are
much smaller than those for BEN series: from 0.0 to 2.23 and from
0.0 to 7.63, respectively (Table 3). The mean values for these two kinds of ranges are
0.98 for BCO series and 4.04 for BEN series. This means that the variability
of substituent’s interactions in BCO series is approximately
4 times weaker than that in BEN series. The next difference, the averaged
values of SESE for BCO series are always negative and amount from
0.0 (H) to −1.37 (NO2), whereas the SESE for BEN
series may be either negative, the lowest value is for X = F (−0.83),
or positive for X = NMe2 (+0.65) (Table 3).

Conclusions
The
application of cSAR and SESE concepts to describe SEs in 4-X-BCO-Y
and 4-X-BEN-Y derivatives has enabled the investigation of the nature
of X···Y intramolecular interactions, that is, their
inductive and resonance contributions.

The analyses of the inductive
SEs by the use of the cSAR(CH2) approach applied to X-BCO-Y
systems revealed that the changes
in the SE are qualitatively similar to those found in monosubstituted
BCOs. However, the slopes for linear regressions of cSAR(CH2) versus cSAR(Y) or cSAR(X) are (as absolute values) greater for
NH2 and OH derivatives than for the NO2 and
COOH ones. This indicates a different mechanism of interactions between
CH2 groups and Y differing in ED and EA properties.

The inductive SE exhibits a high level of additivity, which depends
on the kind of substituents. This decreases with a decrease of EA
(an increase of ED) properties of the substituents.

The SESE
approach applied to X-BCO-Y series reveals a good correlation
with the empirical F constants; similarly for X-BEN-Y
series, the SESE values correlate well with the classical Hammett
constants.

The difference, ΔSESE, between SESE values
for X-BEN-Y and
X-BCO-Y characterizes the resonance effect, and in consequence, follows
a good correlation with resonance constants R.

Thus, the above-described results of the application of the SESE
approach (to disubstituted BEN and BCO derivatives) have confirmed
well the older concept of the SE based on the additivity of the inductive
and resonance effects.

To sum up, the obtained results of quantum
chemical modeling of
the SE by means of SESE and cSAR approaches exhibit a good agreement
with commonly accepted empirical concepts. The advantage of using
these modeling is that they can be applied to any kind of molecules.

Theoretical
Methods
Four series of X-BCO-Y derivatives
with fixed group Y = NO2, COOH, OH, NH2, and
the 16 substituents (Scheme 1) were used to investigate the inductive and resonance SEs.

The substituent properties were characterized by SESE and cSAR
parameters. SESE descriptors were obtained using the homodesmotic
reaction (Scheme 3, eq 3) 3  

Scheme 3 Homodesmotic Reaction Used To Obtain SESE Parameter
The cSAR parameter was calculated
as a sum of charges at all atoms
of the substituent X or Y and the charge at the ipso carbon atom;
cSAR(CH2) was obtained as a mean value for CH2 fragments in the same position of BCO. Additionally, cSAR values
for all CH2 groups inside the BCO ring, named cSAR(FRAG),
by summing up the atomic charges of carbon and hydrogen was obtained.
The Hirshfeld method46 was applied to calculate
all cSAR values.

For all analyzed structures, optimization was
performed with the
use of the Gaussian 09 program.47 The B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)
method was used for all calculations as the one which was proven to
give fine results.35 The vibrational frequencies
were calculated at the same level of theory to confirm that all calculated
structures correspond to the minima on potential energy surface.
