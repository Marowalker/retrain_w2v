A novel
conformation-driven self-assembly system from a one-dimensional
polymer to a metal–organic double nanotube has been developed.
DFT calculations indicate that the double nanotube with a syn-conformation of ligands is a thermodynamically favored
stable product than a one-dimensional polymer. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first example of the infinite metal–organic
double nanotube. In addition, a discrete M6L8-type cage has also been in situ self-assembled from rationally selected
building blocks.

Introduction
Construction
of supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) with
well-defined nanosized cavities has attracted much attention, not
only because of the fascinating structures but also the interesting
host–guest chemistry and potential applications in catalyses,1 supramolecular polymers,2 photophysical properties,3 separation,
and recognition.4 Coordination-driven self-assembly
as a bottom-up approach has been proven to be an efficient method
to assemble SCCs through carefully selecting building blocks. Flexible
tripodal ligands,5 as the most important
building blocks, with a C3 symmetry, are
a series of competitive candidates for assembly of metal–organic
supramolecular ensembles because of their flexible conformation, including syn- and anticonformation. Generally, syn-conformation may lead to discrete metallocages or metal–organic
nanotubes, while anticonformation always results
in one-dimension (1D) metal–organic polymers. Up till now,
various metallocages with different sizes and shapes have been successfully
assembled from suitable tripodal linkers with a syn-conformation and metal species.6 However,
just a few metal–organic nanotubes have been developed,7 and the rational assembly of metal–organic
nanotubes, especially for double nanotubes, is extremely difficult
and always in trouble, and the influences governing their self-assembly
are still obscure. Therefore, controllable design and assembly of
nanotubes through a coordination-driven self-assembly based on formation
of metal-ligand bonds have therefore remained a challenge for chemists.

In this work, a novel conformation driven self-assembly system
from a one-dimensional polymer to an infinite metal–organic
double-nanotube has been developed by the reaction of AgCF3SO3 and 2,4,6-tri[(4-pyridyl)sulfanylmethyl]-1,3,5-triazine
(tpst), in which the anticonformation of tpst changed
to the syn-conformation during the process. Interestingly,
the fascinating double-nanotube is successfully obtained for the first
time; in addition, a discrete M6L8-type cage,
[Pd6(tpst)8]12+, has been in situ
assembled based on four-coordinated Pd(CH3CN)2(CF3SO3)2 and tpst (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Syn-Conformation of tpst with Two-Coordinated and
Four-Coordinated Metal Ions Lead to Double-Nanotubes and M6L8-Type Metallocage; Anticonformation
of tpst with a Two-Coordinated Metal Ion Lead to a One-Dimensional
Metal–Organic Polymer
Results and Discussion
In order to develop such novel
supramolecular ensembles, a flexible
tripodal ligand, tpst, has been selected. The ligand contains a rigid
triazine ring, soft methylene group, and pyridyl group, which is so
flexible that it can adopt the syn-conformation to
satisfy construction of metal–organic nanotubes or metallocages
based on suitable metal acceptors. For example, Ag(I) is naturally
linear two-coordinated, and infinite metal–organic nanotubes
or a M3L2-type cage that may be obtained from
AgCF3SO3 and the syn-conformation
of tpst, while Pd(II) is usually square four-coordinated, so that
Pd(CH3CN)2(CF3SO3)2 will mostly react with tpst and form a M6L8-type cage. Herein, tpst has been selected to react with both
AgCF3SO3 and Pd(CH3CN)2(CF3SO3)2. High-resolution mass
spectrometry (HRMS) spectra demonstrate that Ag3L2-type and Pd6L8-type compounds can be easily
self-assembled in a dimethylformamide (DMF) solution at both room
temperature and 65°, in which the 1522 peak corresponds to [Ag3(tpst)2(CF3SO3)2]+ (Figure 1a), and the 2866 peak corresponds to [Pd6(tpst)8(CF3SO3)10]2+, the 1861
peak corresponds to [Pd6(tpst)8(CF3SO3)9]3+, respectively (Figure 1b).

spectra: (a) the 1522 peak corresponds to
[Ag3(tpst)2(CF3SO3)2]+; (b) the 2866 peak corresponds to [Pd6(tpst)8(CF3SO3)10]2+, the 1861 peak corresponds to [Pd6(tpst)8(CF3SO3)9]3+, respectively. (Red represents calculated results, black represents
experimental results.)

These two Ag3L2-type and Pd6L8-type compounds have the desired conformations as we
expected.
Slowly diffusing the methanol solution of AgCF3SO3 into the chloroform solution of tpst for two days leads to IMU-1, formulated as [Ag1.5(tpst)(CF3SO3)1.5]CHCl3 (IMU-1, see Figure 2). Single
crystal X-ray analysis reveals that IMU-1 crystallized
in the triclinic space group P1̅, its asymmetric
unit contains one and a half Ag(I) ions, one tpst ligand, one dissociative
CHCl3 molecule, one CF3SO3– anion, and half-undetermined CF3SO3– anion. In this structure, tpst adopts anticonformation
to bind with three Ag(I) through the N atoms of the three pyridyl
groups, and Ag(I) ions adopt a linear two-coordinated mode to link
two N atoms from two different ligands (Figure 2). The distances of Ag–N bonds are
from 2.147 to 2.176 Å.

chain polymer of IMU-1.

Structural analysis shows that IMU-1 is a one-dimension
metal–organic polymer. In the structure of IMU-1, the ligands adopt anticonformation rather than syn-conformation to coordinate with Ag(I). However, when
the prolonging reaction time from two days to five days, a mass of
rod-like crystals were obtained. Structural analysis indicates that
this new crystal is a metal–organic double-nanotube, formulated
as [Ag3(tpst)2(CF3SO3)3]CHCl3 (IMU-2, see Figure 3). Finally, these two kinds
of crystals coexist in solution, in which the amount of IMU-2 is more than that of IMU-1. To our knowledge, this
is the first example of infinite metal–organic double-nanotubes
assembled through a coordination-driven self-assembly.

Figure 3 (a) The asymmetric unit
of IMU-2; (b) Ag–Ag
bond in IMU-2; (c) double-nanotube of IMU-2.

Single crystal X-ray analysis
indicates that the IMU-2 crystallized in the triclinic
space group P1̅,
its asymmetric unit, contains three Ag(I) ions, two tpst ligands,
two CF3SO3– anions, and one
undetermined CF3SO3– anion
(Figure 3a). Every
equivalent tpst acts as a three-connected linker to bridge Ag(I) ions
to form the double-nanotube. Each ligand binds to three Ag(I) ions
through the N atoms of the three pyridyl groups, and each Ag(I) ion
is in turn coordinated by the pyridyl groups of another two ligands
to form two malposed Ag3(tpst)2-nanosized cages.
Such cages are linked by Ag–Ag bonds from neighboring silver
atoms to form an unprecedented metal–organic double-nanotube
with two pentagon pores ranging from 9.995 to 13.324 Å (Figures 3b,c and 4). The Ag–Ag distances are in the range of
3.197–3.265 Å and the distances of Ag–N bonds are
from 2.129 to 2.150 Å.

Figure 4 (a) A view of IMU-2 from the a axis;
(b) space-filling models of IMU-2; (c) a view of IMU-2 from the b axis.

Both these two structures contain the Ag3(tpst)2 unit, which are consistent with the HRMS result in DMF solution,
even though tpst adopts different conformations in IMU-1 and IMU-2. In order to deeply understand the self-assembly
process, the formation mechanism of double-nanotubes has been studied
in depth using the density functional theory (DFT). In the DFT calculations
(Table 1 and Figure S1), the structures of IMU-1 and IMU-2 are investigated. For comparison, the bond
lengths of Ag–N (IMU-1: 2.145–2.171 vs
2.147–2.176 Å, IMU-2: 2.016–2.238
vs 2.129–2.150 Å) and Ag–Ag (IMU-2: 3.008–3.261 vs 3.197–3.265 Å), as well as the
pore distances (IMU-2: 8.061–12.610 vs 9.995–13.324
Å) in the calculation structures are well in agreement with our
experiment results, indicating that the DFT calculations are reasonable.

IMU-3	–1.51	2.208	 	18.272	
According to the ref (8), it has been well known
that unstable products with higher energy
will always be preferentially formed, while thermodynamically favored
products with lower energy will be obtained in the end. In the DFT
calculation, the formation energy of IMU-2 is more negative
than that of IMU-1 (−1.63 vs −1.27 eV),
indicating that IMU-2 is a thermodynamically favored
product compared to IMU-1. So, it can be inferred that
the initially rapidly formed IMU-1 with anticonformation of tpst probably is an unstable product, and the later
formed IMU-2 with a syn-conformation
of tpst is a more stable product than IMU-1.

Crystals
suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction of IMU-3 (Figure 5), formulated
as [Pd3(tpst)4(CF3SO3–)6(CH3CN)2(H2O)19, have been successfully produced
through slowly diffusing the acetonitrile solution of tpst into the
water solution of Pd(CH3CN)2(CF3SO3)2. The crystallographic analysis of IMU-3 reveals that its structure is a supramolecular cube [Pd6(tpst)8]12+ with a nanometer-sized inner cage
and crystallized in the cubic space group Pn3̅n. Its asymmetric unit contains a quarter of Pd(II), one
third of tpst and half undetermined CF3SO3– anion (Figure 5a). Every tpst ligand bonds to three Pd(II) centers by the
N atoms of the three pyridyl groups as expected. Each Pd(II) center
is in turn coordinated by four N atoms from four different ligands
acquiring a PdN4 square-planar coordination environment
(Figure 5b). The Pd–N
distances are equal to 2.007 Å. From the three 4-fold axis directions,
the six faces are each effectively blocked off by one palladium atom
and four pyridyl groups from four separate ligands (Figure 6a). The distance from the six
Pd(II) atoms to the cavity center is 8.587 Å, which is well in
agreement with the DFT calculations (18.272/2 = 9.136 Å in Table 1). The centroids of
the eight C3N3 rings in the ligands are each
located at the 3-fold inversion axes and very close to the corners
of the cube, 9.896 Å from the cavity center to the C3N3 rings. Furthermore, this nanocage has twelve flexible
windows in each 2-fold axis direction, which may adjust the size of
the windows to allow anions or suitable guest molecules to enter or
leave the cage.6j The calculation results
show that the formation energy of IMU-3 is −1.51
eV, which is close to that of IMU-2 (−1.63 eV),
indicating it is also a stable product.

Conclusions
In summary, a novel conformation driven self-assembly
system from
a 1D metal–organic polymer to a double-nanotube has been developed.
To our knowledge, the double-nanotube has not been reported yet before
and this is the first example of nanosized metal–organic double-tube;
in addition, a discrete [Pd6(tpst)8]12+ cage has been in situ assembled based on PdN4 nodes as
we expect. This work may provide new ideas for in situ self-assembly
of supramolecular ensembles with unique structures.

Experimental
Section
Reagents
All commercial materials were purchased from
various commercial sources (Sigma-Aldrich and Alfa Aesar) and used
as received without further purification.

Characterization
Elemental analyses for C, H, and N
were carried out on a German Elementary Vario EL III instrument. 1H NMR and 13C spectra were recorded at a Bruker
AM-600 (600 MHz) spectrometer. Powder X-ray diffraction was obtained
using Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) by an Empyrean
PANalytical advanced diffractometer equipped with a diffracted-beamed
monochromator. Infrared spectra were recorded in the 4000–400
cm–1 region using a KBr pellet technique on a PerkinElmer
spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analyses were recorded on an NETZSCH
STA 449 C unit at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under a flowing
nitrogen atmosphere.

X-ray Crystallography
Single crystal
X-ray diffraction
experiments were carried on a SuperNova diffractometer equipped with
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) by using a ω
scan mode. The crystal structures were solved by a direct method and
refined by full-matrix least squares on F2 using SHELXTL-2018 package. All nonhydrogen atoms were refined with
anisotropic displacement parameters. All hydrogen atoms were located
at geometrically calculated positions and refined by riding. The free
solvent molecules and counter anions are highly disordered in IMU-3, and attempts to locate and refine the solvent and counter
anion peaks were unsuccessful. The diffused electron densities resulting
from these solvent molecules and counter anions were removed using
the SQUEEZE routine of PLATON; the structures were then refined again
using the data generated. The crystallographic data are summarized
in Tables S1–S3. CCDC 1892022, 1892023,
and 1892025 contain the supplementary crystallographic data for IMU-1, IMU-2, and IMU-3. These data

Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif.

DFT Calculation Methods
and Models
All calculations
were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package.9 The electron-ion interaction was described with
the projector augmented wave method.10 The
electron exchange and correlation energies were treated within the
generalized gradient approximation in the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof formalism.11 The energy cut-off of the plane wave basis was
set to 450 eV, an electron smearing width of σ = 0.2 eV was
employed according to the Methfessel-Paxton technique, and the MP k-point sampling was utilized.

The formation energy
was calculated according to Eform = (Ecell – nEtpst – NEmetal)/n, where Ecell is the unit cell energy
of IMU-1 ≈ IMU-3 crystals, Etpst is the energy of one molecular tpst, and Emetal is the energy of the atomic metal. Therefore,
the more negative the Eform, the more
stable the crystal. In Figure S1, the four
crystal models of IMU-1 ≈ IMU-3 were
shown, and the 5 × 3 × 3, 3 × 3 × 2, and 1 ×
1 × 1 k-point samplings were done for these
models, respectively.
