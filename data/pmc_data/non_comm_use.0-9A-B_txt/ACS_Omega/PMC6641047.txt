Introduction
1,4-Disubstituted bicyclo[2.2.2]octane
(BCO) derivatives are key
molecular systems for the estimation of so-called inductive/field
substituent constants.1 The concept of
inductive substituent constants (σind) was introduced
by Roberts and Moreland.2 For this purpose,
ionization constants measured in a 50% (by volume) ethanol–water
solution for 4-substituted BCO carboxylic acids (Scheme 1) were applied. Inductive substituent
constants obtained for these systems characterize mutual interactions
between two relatively distant functional groups acting without the
possibility of a resonance effect. Later, for this purpose, 4-substituted
quinuclidine3,4 and gas-phase acidities of 4-substituted
BCO carboxylic acids5 were used. Many other
attempts for the estimation of substituent constants (denoted as:
σind, σI, σF, or F) have appeared, and in most cases, they have led to similar
numerical results. This is well illustrated in Table 2 in the review
by Hansch et al.6 Along with the development
of research methods and accumulation of new results, a question concerning
the mechanisms of interactions between the functional groups in 1,4-disubstituted
BCO derivatives has arisen. Is the effect transmitted through space
or through bonds? The first would be a field substituent effect (SE),
whereas the other, an inductive SE.

Scheme 1 4-X-Bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylic
Acids (4-X-BCO-COOH); X = H,
OH, CO2C2H5, Br, CN
In the first case, the effect should be described
by electrostatic
rules.7,8 Some attempts were carried out by the use
of the isolated molecule approach.9,10 Exner and
Bohm1,11 performed a very detailed study using both
these strategies and arrived at the conclusion that transmission of
the SE through space, at least of noncharged functional groups, is
of “little validity”. The alternative mechanism of
interaction, that is, the transmission of the effect through bonds,
“cannot estimate the SE explicitly; it describes only attenuation
within the molecule”.1 This means
that each bond weakens the effect by a constant ratio. In summary, according to the results of even the most detailed analysis
of various theories of SEs, it is impossible to validate these approaches
on the basis of experimental facts.1

Recently, several quantum chemical models have been developed that
are of substantial importance for the discussion of SEs in terms of
physically defined concepts. It should also be noted that particular
physical characteristics are compared or correlated with substituent
constants. One of the frequently applied methodologies made use of
various defined electrostatic potentials, as follows: on particular
atoms, at atoms of reaction sites, or in other defined sites of molecules.12−16 Additionally and importantly, application of the molecular electrostatic
potential topography allowed us to appraise the through-bond and through-space
SEs.17 Implementation of the energy decomposition
analysis18 allowed us to document that
the pi-electron energy of SE can be correlated with the substituent
constants.19 Another very important issue
is the energetic characteristic termed SE stabilization energy (SESE),
obtained by the use of the isodesmic or homodesmotic reaction approach.20−22 In many cases, it was demonstrated that the SESE values correlated
well with the substituent constants.23−25 Quite recently, it has
been shown that the sum of charges at the substituent and ipso carbon
atom, termed cSAR (acronym derived from the charge of the substituent
active region),23−27 is also well correlated with the Hammett substituent constants.
Moreover, it should be noted that usually the values of cSAR(X), calculated
by means of various atomic charge assessments, are mutually well correlated.28

The motivation for our report is to provide
a new perspective on
the inductive/field effect in monosubstituted derivatives of bicycloctane
(1-X-BCO) derivatives. For this purpose, the cSAR approach will be
applied and the cSAR(X) values will be confronted with the substituent constants.

Results and Discussion
To study the nature of the SE in 1-X-BCO derivatives, the cSAR
parameter has been used to characterize all fragments of the studied
systems (Scheme 2).
Therefore, cSAR(X), cSAR(CH2) at the 2 and 3 positions,
and cSAR(CH) at the 4 position have been obtained; in the case of
cSAR(CH2), the mean values of all three CH2 groups
at the C2 and C3 positions have also been taken into account. Figure 1 presents the results
and regression lines, wherein cSAR(CH2) in positions 2
and 3 and cSAR(CH) in position 4 of 1-X-BCO are plotted against cSAR(X).
In all three cases, the regression lines have high determination coefficients,
(R2 > 0.906); hence, the slopes of
these
lines are reliable data. As observed, their ratio was 0.19:0.12:0.06, which is near the ideal
3:2:1 ratio, as could be expected from the theory of the inductive
effect.1 It appears that this result may
be accepted as a strong argument for the inductive mechanism of the
SE in BCO systems. Additionally, it should be mentioned that the through-space
interactions seem to be negligible in our case because the CH2 and CH groups have a very small dipole moment and hence very
low electrostatic energy.

2–4 on cSAR(X)
for 1-X-BCO derivatives.

Scheme 2 1-X-Bicyclo[2.2.2]octane Derivatives (1-X-BCO), X = NMe2, NH2, OH, OMe, CH3, H, F, Cl, CF3, CN, CHO, COMe, CONH2, COOH, NO2, NO
Actually, both kinds of interactions,
via bonds and through space,
are described by the substituent constants, F.6Figure 2 shows the relationship between cSAR(X) and F values for two groups of substituents: (i) with electron-donating
properties (σp < 0, X = Me, OMe, OH, NH2, NMe2) and (ii) with electron-accepting properties (positive
σp values, X = NO, NO2, CN, CF3, COMe, COOH, CHO, CONH2, Cl, F). In both cases, cSAR(X)
values decrease with an increase in F constants.
However, the electron-attracting ability of the substituents of the
first group is significantly weaker than that of the substituents
of the second group.

Figure 2 Dependence of cSAR(X) on F constants,
taken from
ref (6), for 1-X-BCO
derivatives (red, σp < 0; blue, σp > 0); for all data, y = −0.218x + 0.024 and R2 = 0.825.

The next, new result is associated
with the application of cSAR(X)
as a measure of the electron-donating/attracting properties of X.
It has already been shown that the values of cSAR(X) depend on the
kind of system to which X is attached,23,24 and this kind
of SE is termed reverse SE.28 The obtained
cSAR(X) values for 1-X-BCO and monosubstituted benzene (X-Ph) derivatives
are listed in Table 1, together with the differences (Δ) between the values estimated
for the X-Ph and 1-X-BCO systems, whereas Figure 3 illustrates these differences by means of
linear regression. Its slope indicates that the SE in phenyl derivatives
is ∼1.7 times stronger than that in the BCO derivatives. This
is due to the difference in the nature of interactions. In the BCO
series, only the inductive effect works, whereas in the phenyl series,
both inductive and resonance effects are in use.

in X-Ph on cSAR(X) in 1-X-BCO derivatives.

Additionally, according to the Taft approach,29 the separation of the resonance and inductive
effects of
a substituent, Δ, may be considered as a measure of the resonance
effect. Indeed, when Δ is plotted against the resonance substituent
constants, R, the image is as shown in Figure 4. The high determination coefficient
supports this assumption.

constant R.

Conclusions
The estimated values of cSAR(CH2)
and cSAR(CH) for groups
in the 2, 3, and 4 positions of 1-X-BCO, influenced by substituent
X, are attenuated in a regular ratio, which is 3:2:1. Hence, it seems
justified to accept that F constants mostly represent
the inductive effect.

Electron-donating substituents, by means
of Hammett σp < 0, are sometimes electron attracting,
when determined
in monosubstituted BCO derivatives.

The SE in monosubstituted
benzene derivatives is ∼1.7 times
stronger than that in the 1-X-substituted BCO systems, that is, the
aliphatic ones. Furthermore, the differences in cSAR(X) values for
substituents in phenyl and BCO derivatives may be used as measures
of the resonance effect of substituent X.

Computational Methods
An optimization, without any symmetry constraints, of all studied
systems was performed using the B3LYP hybrid functional30,31 with the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set.32 The
vibrational frequencies were calculated at the same level of theory
to confirm that all calculated structures correspond to the minima
on the potential energy surface.

The cSAR parameter26,33 was calculated by summing the
atomic charges of all atoms of group X and the charge at the ipso
carbon atom to which X is attached  For assessments of the atomic
charges, the
Hirshfeld34 method was applied.

All
calculations were performed using the Gaussian09 program.35
