Mesoporous
silica nanoparticles (MSNs) are considered as promising
next-generation nanocarriers for health-related applications. However,
their effectiveness mostly relies on their efficient and surface-specific
functionalization. In this contribution, we explored different strategies
for the rational multistep synthesis of functional MCM-48-type MSNs
with selectively created active inner and/or external surfaces. Functional
groups were first installed using a combination of (delayed) co-condensation
and post-grafting procedures. Both amine [(3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane
(APTS)] and thiol [(3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane (MPTS)] silanes
were used, in various addition sequences. Following this, the different
platforms were further functionalized with polyethylene glycol and/or
with a pro-chelate ligand used as a magnetic resonance imaging contrast
agent (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid chelates) and/or loaded
with quercetin and/or grafted with an organic dye (rhodamine). The
efficiency of the multiple grafting strategies and the effects on
the MSN carrier properties are presented. Finally, the colloidal stability
of the different systems was evaluated in physiological media, and
preliminary tests were performed to verify their drug release capability.
The use of MPTS appeared beneficial when compared to APTS in delayed
co-condensation procedures to preserve both selective distribution
of the functional groups, reactive functionality, and pore ordering.
Our results provide in-depth insights into the efficient design of
(multi)functional MSNs and especially on the crucial role played by
the sequence of step-by-step functionalization methods aiming to produce
multipurpose and stable bioplatforms.

Introduction
Mesoporous silica nanoparticles
(MSNs) are promising candidates
for biomedicine-related applications,1−10 and they are particularly used in the area of targeted and controlled
drug delivery,11−16 as well as in medical imaging/diagnosis17−20 or in a combination of both,
that is, theranostic systems.21−25 The growing interest for MSNs is directly related to their porosity
features. Indeed, these materials are highly porous, with a specific
surface area of about 1000–1500 m2 g–1, mesopores of size usually ranging from 2 to 20 nm and pore volume
ranging from 0.8 to 1.5 cm3 g–1.26−28 In addition, MSNs are seen as versatile materials because they can
be synthesized with well-defined particle size and shape as well as
tunable pore network characteristics.29,30 Currently,
data regarding the potential adverse effects of MSNs on overall human
health on the mid-term and long term are still missing, that is, no
clinical trials have been performed yet.31,32 However, amorphous silica is so far considered safe by the Food
and Drug Administration and has been extensively used in many of our
daily-based products or as excipient in pharmaceutical formulations
for many years.33 Owing to their porosity,
their relative stability in aqueous media, and degradation in biological
media, MSNs became of interest as drug reservoir and bioimaging platforms.
A large variety of therapeutic compounds can be accommodated inside
their pore network, and many examples using such particles as hosts
to improve the administration of simple or more complex therapeutic
compounds have been reported.4,34−37 However, in most cases, functionalization of the silica surfaces
is required to integrate the desired “biological functions”,
for example, enhanced colloidal stability in blood or physiological
fluids of interest, increased blood circulation time, hemocompatibility,
targeted and/or stimuli-responsive release, imaging capabilities,
and so forth.4,38,39 The most common design of “functional MSNs” usually
involves the functionalization of two types of “surfaces”,
(1) an external surface functionalized by stabilizing groups such
as polyethylene glycol (PEG) and/or biotargeting groups such as specific
ligands or antibodies40,41 and (2) an internal surface,
functionalized or not in order to favor the sequestration and/or release
of therapeutic species such as drugs, nutraceuticals, metal complexes,
therapeutic peptides, proteins, and so on. From the synthesis point
of view, the major issues in such a design are as follows: (1) the
difficult distinction between the outer/external and inner/internal
pore surfaces of the particles,42 (2) the
interference between the different functionalities, (3) the potential
pore-blocking and steric hindrance issues resulting from the different
grafting and loading protocols,43 and (4)
the control of the amount of each guest molecule being grafted/loaded.44 In addition, the multifunctionalization of MSNs
should be performed in a minimal number of synthesis steps in order
to obtain an easily scalable system and to minimize the costs, with
low amounts of harmful solvents and short preparation time. Therefore,
while the addition of functionalities is a necessity for the efficient
biomedical application of MSNs, preserving as much as possible the
porosity features during the early stages of the process appears to
be critical and cannot be disregarded.

These issues and the
selective surface functionalization of MSNs
are challenges that have been faced by researchers over the last recent
years, and many strategies have been proposed. The “classical”
post-grafting (PG) methods, while being convenient, can result in
a nonuniform and poorly controlled silane distribution and usually
includes several steps.45−47 Another way to discriminate the
different outer/inner surfaces is to use impregnation techniques such
as the incipient wetness.39 This method,
using an amount of solvent equal to the pore volume of the MSNs, is
known to selectively fill the pores by capillarity, resulting in a
mostly inner surface functionalization. However, this technique is
potentially time-consuming and is mainly used to load inorganics,19,39 even if few examples using organosilanes were reported.48 The last most common way of introducing functionalities
is to add the organosilanes during the synthesis of the MSNs.49 This method, known as the co-condensation (CC)
or one-pot synthesis, normally leads to a homogenous distribution
of the functionalities inside the mesoporous materials. However, control
of the spatial distribution is difficult, and some functional groups
end up inactive being embedded within the silica framework (the pore
walls) with no access to the surface.42,50−53 To overcome these limitations, Kecht et al. developed the delayed CC (DCC) method.54 This
strategy is based on the delayed addition of silanes as compared to
the main silicon source, to initially allow the formation of the MSNs
and then to functionalize the different surfaces. Indeed, if the silanes
are added quickly after the main silicon source [e.g., tetraethylorthosilicate
(TEOS)], one may obtain a material with functionalities mainly located
in the core. On the contrary, if the silanes are introduced after
a longer time, the resultant active groups should be mainly grafted
on the external surface. This method usually limits the entrapment
of functionalities within the pore walls, especially when applied
to MSN synthesis with rapid formation kinetics such as nanosized MCM-41
and MCM-48.55 The main advantage of this
technique is the possibility to incorporate the desired organosilanes
at different spatial locations by simply controlling the addition
sequences. For instance, this strategy was successfully applied to
functionalize MSNs with polymer moieties56−58 or to produce
MSNs exhibiting a pH-responsive gating effect for controlled drug
delivery.59 In the vast majority of cases,
(3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTS) is used to first functionalize
the MSNs. Indeed, this silane allows functionalizing the surfaces
with amine groups which are key active sites for bioconjugation reactions.60−63 Moreover, it is relatively easy to work with APTS, that is, although
it should be handled under inert atmosphere, it is not excessively
sensitive to humidity and easily accessible. However, the possibility
of further reactions of amine-functionalized MSNs was found to be
dependent on the functionalization procedure.20,23,24 Co-condensed materials were systematically
found to have less accessible amine sites as compared to materials
functionalized by other techniques. In the same way, post-functionalization
is commonly associated with pore blocking/diffusion issues in the
resulting hybrids.64 It is thus proposed
to work with other functional silanes such as (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane
(MPTS). MPTS has been used with ordered mesoporous silica65,66 and like the amine groups, thiols enable also further biofunctionalization
and conjugation reactions. Furthermore, among the polymers that were
utilized to improve both colloidal stability and the stealth properties
of MSNs, PEG is most widely used. It has a high affinity for water
and owing to its numerous ether groups, it binds to a large amount
of water molecules adopting a “cloud-like” conformation
that acts as a water barrier and protects the particle surface.67 Moreover, PEG was shown to improve the blood
circulation half-life time and the biocompatibility of the carriers
which are both critical parameters in the field of healthcare.68 Nevertheless, the challenges reside in achieving
optimal particle modification with given functional groups and placing
them in specific locations inside the structure, without altering/losing
the well-defined porosity features of the MSNs.

To this aim,
we initiated a comprehensive investigation of the
modification procedures of MSNs, comparing different strategies, in
order to ultimately establish robust and tailor-made functionalization
protocols. In this study, MCM-48-type MSNs were chosen as a typical
model of mesoporous silica particles. These particles were then modified
with APTS and/or MPTS accompanied by PEGylation and/or grafting of
the diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) pro-chelating ligand.
Addition sequences are varied and the advantages/limitations of (delayed)
CC and PG methods are critically discussed. The materials at different
steps of the synthesis were characterized by a variety of methods,
including N2 physisorption, transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (ssNMR),
low-angle powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA), and elemental analysis (EA). In addition, the colloidal behavior
of the functionalized MSNs was scrutinized in various pH buffers over
a long period of time using dynamic light scattering (DLS). Preliminary
drug release tests were also performed with the particles resulting
from different protocols. Our results provide in-depth insights into
the efficient design of (multi)functional MSNs and especially on the
crucial role played by the arrangement of the step-by-step multifunctionalization
strategy. Therefore, our findings offer flexible synthesis methods
and recipes for tailor-made nanocarriers in a reproducible way, which
is expected to be of prime importance regarding the ongoing development
of next-generation smart theranostic (nano)platforms.21−25

Results and Discussion
The different functionalization pathways
that were investigated
in this study are summarized in Scheme 1. Easily reproducible pathways are highlighted in green,
while the ones that led to difficulties in reproducibility or where
the functionalization yield was quite low are highlighted as black
routes. Finally, the ones that did not provide any satisfactory results
are highlighted in red. Each of them includes not only different options
of functionalization, such as PG, CC, and DCC, but also the grafting/loading
of specific species of interest for biorelated applications in order
to demonstrate the usefulness of the multifunctionalization method.
In all cases, PEGylation was also performed. To obtain meaningful
references regarding porosity and pore ordering features, both calcined
and chemically extracted mesoporous MCM-48 nanoparticles were first
synthesized.69 The characterization of
the two samples is presented in Figures S1 and S2. For both materials, TEM images (Figure S1a–d) showed spherical particles of about 130–170
nm. DLS measurements (Figure S1c,f) revealed
an average hydrodynamic particle diameter of 192 and 255 nm for calcined
and extracted MCM-48 samples, respectively, in agreement with the
TEM observations. No sign of major aggregation was found and one can
observe the ordering of the pore structure in the TEM images. The
cubic Ia3d symmetry of the mesopore
network was further evidenced by low-angle XRD measurements, as presented
in Figure S1b–e. N2 physisorption
analyses (Figure S2) show for the two materials
typical type IVb isotherms with a sharp pore condensation/evaporation
step, being characteristic of high-quality mesoporous silicas with
pores below 4 nm.70 The samples exhibit
comparable high specific surface areas of about 1230 m2 g–1 (Table S1). Slightly
larger nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) pore size and total
pore volume were obtained for the extracted material (3.5 nm and 1.0
cm3 g–1) as compared to the calcined
one (3.2 nm and 0.8 cm3 g–1) in accordance
with the shrinkage occurring during the calcination process.71 All the obtained data are in good agreement
with previous reports.15,16,19,69

Scheme 1 Multistep Functionalization Pathways of
MSNs
Amine/Thiol Functionalization
All
the amine- and thiol-functionalized
samples discussed here were synthesized at least in triplicates to
ensure reliable and reproducible results. The C, H, N, and S contents
from EA are compiled for all samples in Tables S2 and S3. Amine functionalities were added using a CC or a
DCC strategy or via PG. The quantity of amine introduced via PG was
varied between 4 and 12 mmol per gram of degassed MSN particles. The
TGA data revealed no significant difference in the mass loss of the
resulting NH2-MSNs, indicating that 4 mmol of APTS is already
in condition of excess of the aminosilane for the grafting procedure
(Figure S3). Using more APTS only resulted
in unbounded APTS which was washed out during the washing procedures.
The PG time dependence on the grafting efficiency was also evaluated
as shown in Figure 1. In many reports, classic grafting procedures are carried overnight.72,73 However, in our case, no significant changes in the organic amount
being grafted was observed after only half an hour of reaction. This
result, being consistent with the relatively fast hydrolysis and condensation
kinetics of the APTS in nonneutral medium,74 suggests that grafting procedures could be performed in a faster
way and do not require overnight reaction. To compare our data with
the literature,75 it was decided to use
a PG time of 4 h for the following samples. The nitrogen loading of
post-grafted APTS-MSNs after 4 h, obtained by EA, was 1.6 mmol g–1 (Table S3). Typical N2 physisorption isotherms at −196 °C with corresponding
NLDFT pore size distribution (PSD) and TGA curves obtained for the
calcined MSNs post-grafted with APTS are shown in Figure S4. A satisfactory agreement here between the quadruplicates
was obtained with TGA and gas adsorption techniques, so it was decided
to average the data for all tabular data presented in this study.
For all NH2-MSNs synthesized via CC or DCC, the success
of the functionalization was confirmed using solid-state 13C cross polarization (CP) NMR (Figure S5). TGA indicated a mass loss of 12 ± 2% for all samples pointing
to a similar amount of grafted amine groups (Table S4). Also, as demonstrated in Figure 2a, APTS functionalization following CC and
DCC pathways led to almost identical materials from a physisorption
point of view. For both samples, a drastic decrease in the specific
surface area (543 m2 g–1, 56% decrease)
and the total pore volume (0.3 cm3 g–1, 69% decrease) was observed as compared to the pristine extracted
MSNs (Table S1). The porosity features
were slightly less affected when both the calcined and extracted MSNs
were functionalized with APTS via PG. Indeed, a decrease of 34 and
32% and 54 and 54% for the specific surface area and total pore volume
values was noted, respectively. The NLDFT pore size was reduced for
all the samples. The variations in the NH2-MSNs obtained
using different functionalization techniques may be explained by the
effect of the aminosilane on the mesophase during the synthesis and
aging processes. Indeed, as shown in Figure 2c, materials derived from the CC pathways,
that is, CC and DCC, exhibit poorly resolved low-angle XRD patterns,
being typical of samples with no or low pore ordering, whereas the
patterns obtained for the post-grafted silicas are still commensurate
with the cubic Ia3d symmetry (Figure 2c). Thus, it appears
that the presence of the aminosilane destabilizes the synthesis, potentially
because of a pH increase and, thus led to the formation of less porous
materials without any particular pore organization. Even though it
is known that CC often leads to less organized pore networks in the
case of 2-D symmetries (e.g., MCM-41),76 this effect is even more pronounced for 3-D-based pore architectures.
If ordering of the final particles is a prerequisite, the choice of
aminosilanes for early functionalization through one-pot reaction
might therefore not be so suitable, especially in the case of MCM-48-type
MSNs. Also, even if the pore features and ordering are slightly better
preserved for the post-grafted samples, there is still a dramatic
decrease of the available pore volume and surface area of the MSNs,
most likely originating from pore-blocking/hindering issues related
with the grafting method.19 These results
are in line with previous work on the accessibility and chemical reactivity
of amine sites grafted on ordered mesoporous materials.26−28 In contrast, when MPTS was used during DCC, the resulting thiol-functionalized
MSNs retained high porosity. As it can be seen on Figure 2a, a typical type IVb isotherm
was obtained, being similar to the one of the pristine MCM-48 silica
nanoparticles (NPs). The specific surface area was 1090 m2 g–1, the total pore volume was 0.86 cm3 g–1, and the NLDFT mode pore size was 3.4 nm (Table S1). This represents a reduction of only
11 and 14% for the specific surface area and total pore volume, respectively,
as compared to the extracted MSNs. The mode pore size remains almost
unaffected and the PSD stayed sharp and narrow (Figure 2b), being a good indication of the absence
of any pore blocking. Grafting of MPTS was further confirmed using 13C solid-state NMR (Figure S5)
and TGA (Table S4), showing that 12% of
MPTS was grafted onto the MSNs. The SH-MSNs synthesized via DCC also
showed a perfectly well-ordered pore structure (Figure 2c) with an Ia3d symmetry. Therefore, using MPTS is beneficial in the early functionalization
step of the MSNs. Considering that a 10 min delay was applied before
adding the MPTS during the DCC process, most of the thiol functionalities
should be located mainly toward the external surface of the MSNs.
This point is critical because thiol groups will only be used to further
attach “external surface functions”, that is, PEG chains
for colloidal stability and biocompatibility improvement, using PEG-maleimide
for instance. However, “external” thiol groups may not
be sufficient to provide a suitable precursor material that can be
further poly-grafted with molecules of interest. Therefore, we investigated
synthesis options to include both amine and thiol groups using APTS
and MPTS, with the aim to preserve as much as possible the porosity
features unaltered. These different synthesis pathways are shown in Scheme 1 and can be divided
in four groups. In PI to PV (line 2 of Scheme 1), the synthesis design was to use MPTS and
APTS together in DCC or to post-graft APTS onto extracted SH-MSNs-DCC.
In PVI and PVII, co-condensed NH2-MSNs were further functionalized
with MPTS using either DCC or PG, respectively. In PVIII, the material
NH2-MSNs-DCC was post-grafted with MPTS. Finally, in PIX
to PXI, NH2-MSNs-PG was further post-grafted with MPTS,
before or after the rhodamine fluorophore loading (line 2 or 3 of Scheme 1).

(green), NH2-MSNs-DCC (red), and SH-MSNs-DCC (blue).

TEM images of the samples are
presented in Figure 3 (for magnified images, see Figure S6).
The resulting N2 physisorption isotherms
with corresponding NLDFT PSD and low-angle XRD patterns of all the
bifunctional MSNs are presented in Figure 4 (full-scale isotherms are found in Figure S7). All the synthesis strategies yielded
uniform nanospheres of about 130–190 nm, being similar to pristine
MCM-48 MSNs, indicating that the addition of the two organosilanes
via CC and/or DCC and/or PG strategies did not interfere much with
the final shape and size of the silica particles. In all cases, the
presence of both amine and thiol functionalities was also confirmed
by 13C CP NMR as shown in Figure S5 and TGA (Table S4). Indeed, in a typical
carbon NMR spectrum of MSNs functionalized with MPTS, one can note
two resonances at around 9–10 and 27 ppm attributed to the
carbons of the silane propyl chain. More specially, the signal at
27 ppm corresponds to the carbons in alpha and beta and at 9–10
ppm to the carbon in gamma of the mercapto group. The absence of resonance
lines at 36.5, 39.0, or 55.1 ppm attributed to disulfides, thiosulfonates,
or sulfonates77,78 excludes the formation of such
species. The presence of APTS triggers the apparition of new signals
at 43 and 21 ppm, and these were attributed to carbons in alpha and
beta positions of the amine, respectively. The third carbon (in gamma)
expected at about 9 ppm overlaps with the MPTS signal at 9–10
ppm. TGA indicated a mass loss of around 14 ± 4% for all bifunctional
samples synthesized in CC and/or DCC (PII, PIII, and PVI), pointing
to a similar loading of the functional groups. For these three cases,
it was not possible to determine which percentage of organics originated
from MPTS or APTS. For pathways PIV, PV PVII, PVIII, PIX, and PX,
12 ± 2% of the first function was introduced during the first
step (line 1, Scheme 1), whereas only 1–4% were additionally anchored using PG during
the second step. EA revealed that the amount of the first functional
group was reduced by 0.1 mmol g–1 at the maximum
after the second functionalization. For pathways IV and V, the amount
of sulfur is 0.4 mmol g–1, and after the PG of the
amine function the amount of nitrogen was calculated to be 2.1 mmol
g–1, whereas when the amine groups were introduced
first (PVII, PVIII, PIX, and PX), the quantity of nitrogen was much
lower (1.3 mmol g–1), while the amount of sulfur
stays the same (Table S3). Because in these
pathways the second active groups were post-grafted, the resulting
materials will exhibit a limited number of these latter surface groups.
This could potentially decrease the possibilities for subsequent bioconjugation
using the second active group (vide infra). This was corroborated
by EA which revealed that the nitrogen to sulfur ratio was 1 (PII,
PIII and PVI) when introducing both functions at the same time and
6 (PIX and PX) when PG was used. When the amine groups were introduced
as a second function via PG (PIV and V), the N/S ratio was 6 because
of the high amount of amine functions introduced in the system (Table S2). From the physisorption data, one can
easily discriminate two pathways leading to materials with the highest
porosity remaining as compared to the pristine MCM-48 MSNs. Amine-
and thiol-functionalized materials obtained via DCC using MPTS followed
by APTS PG (PIV-2–PV-2, Scheme 1) and via CC using APTS followed by a DCC with MPTS
(PVI-2, Scheme 1) still
showed specific surface areas of 771 and 811 m2 g–1, total pore volumes of 0.52 and 0.51 cm3 g–1, and NLDFT mode pore sizes of 2.9 and 2.7 nm, respectively (Table S1). Moreover, the PXRD patterns of these
two samples (Figure 4c, PVI-2 and PIV-2–PV-2) revealed reasonably well-ordered
pore structures, with an Ia3d pore
symmetry. A slightly less defined pattern was obtained for amine-
and thiol-MSNs resulting from the pathway PVI-2. In this synthesis
route, APTS is first added together with TEOS. As discussed above,
such a CC method usually led to poorly ordered materials.

NLDFT PSD, and (c) low-angle powder XRD analyses of MSNs functionalized
with both APTS and MPTS using the different synthesis approaches presented
in Scheme 1, lines
2 and 3.

However, the subsequent addition
of MPTS in the mother liquor to
perform an additional DCC step appears to limit or balance the effect
of APTS, most probably because of the presence of the acid thiol groups,
and it allows to synthesize a final bifunctional material showing
some clear signs of cubic Ia3d pore
ordering (Figure 4c).
Such a strategy is of particular significance as it allows to obtain
an ordered bifunctional material with an excellent mesostructure using
a one-pot synthesis design. Differently, when APTS is added together
with MPTS during DCC (Scheme 1, PII-2–PIII-2), the resulting MSNs showed a noticeably
lower mesostructure order with a broader PSD (Figure 4a,b, Table S1)
and a less defined diffraction pattern (Figure 4c). Therefore, the sequence of silane addition
is of great importance if one wants to design a functional material
with high porosity and a specific pore structure. As expected, the
use of PG techniques merely to functionalize MSNs with amine and thiol
groups did not alter the order of the pore structure (Figure 4c, PIX-2–PX-2). However,
the N2 physisorption analyses revealed an even lower specific
surface area, pore volume, and pore size as compared to PII-2–PIII-2
(Table S1), in line with the potential
pore blocking/hindrance issues related with such PG procedures. Finally,
PVII and PVIII synthesis routes, which are based on APTS-MSNs obtained
via CC and DCC, respectively, led to the formation of poorly or nonordered
bifunctionalized samples with heavily impaired porosity, as shown
in Figure 4 and Table S1. These results agree with the “negative”
effect of the APTS addition in the mother liquor, as discussed above.
In both cases, the amount of subsequent anchored MPTS was very low,
about 1% (Table S4) and the amount of sulfur
calculated from EA was only half of the amount of nitrogen (Table S3), indicating an ineffective PG procedure.

PEGylation
The PEGylation was performed following the
thiol-maleimide “click” chemistry41 using the thiol-functionalized particles and methoxypolyethylene
glycol maleimide (see Experimental part and Figure S8). The molecular weight of the polymer was 5 kDa with a hydrodynamic
diameter above the pore size of the MCM-48 particles [4.6 nm in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) 10 mM pH 7.4].79 As mentioned
earlier, because a thiol group is needed for this type of PEGylation,
all the samples discussed below were functionalized with MPTS (Scheme 1). To optimize the
PEGylation protocol, we first investigated the relationship between
the amount of PEG-maleimide introduced in the reaction and the resulting
amount of grafted PEG, as determined by TGA. The highest grafting
efficiency was observed with SH-MSNs-DCC (PI-1, Scheme 1). This is not surprising because these particles
exhibit thiol functions which should be mostly located on the outer
surface of the material.54 This sample
was therefore chosen as the reference material, and as seen in Figure 5, no significant
increase in the amount of grafted PEG was observed when more than
1 mass equivalent of PEG-maleimide was used. When 0.5 mass equivalent
of PEG was used, an estimated grafting density of 0.6 PEG nm−2 was calculated. This would correspond to a cross-sectional area
of 1.75 nm2 for PEG molecules, being in good agreement
with the expected size of the PEG-maleimide, that is, 5 kDa,80 and also in line with previous work.29 However, such grafting density implies that
only 5–6% of the grafted thiol sites were used for PEGylation,
if one considers that all MPTS are available and reactive.

Figure 5 Amount of grafted
PEG onto SH-MSNs-DCC as a function of the quantity
of introduced PEG during the PEGylation, according to TGA.

The relatively low grafting density difference
seen when either
0.5 or 1 mass equivalent of PEG was used (Figure 5) indicates that numerous thiol reactive
sites are still available for further functionalization, in both cases.
The observed plateau in Figure 5 is thus due to the surface being saturated by PEG or a steric
hindrance between the PEG molecules ultimately leading to some reactivity
issues. Preliminary visual stability tests showed that at least 1
mass equivalent of PEG was necessary to achieve a proper colloidal
stability with no sedimentation. As depicted in Figure 6, PEG-MSNs obtained following the pathway
PI are stable in water and Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s
Medium (DMEM) cell culture medium for an appreciable amount of time.
In DMEM, the hydrodynamic diameter varied by 5% only during the first
20 h. This result is significant because satisfactory stability of
particles in DMEM is usually the most difficult to obtain, while it
is mandatory for most cell incubation studies. In water, PEGylated
particles (PI-3) displayed an increase of their hydrodynamic diameter
up to 250 nm after 24 h, which then remains stable up to 600 h. This
“swelling” was attributed to the large hydration corona
provided by the PEG molecules. We thus decided to work with 1 mass
equivalent for all other PEGylation of the MSNs. Then, the success
of the PEGylation procedure with the different functionalized MSNs
was investigated in detail via 13C CP ssNMR. A typical
spectrum obtained for MSNs prepared following the pathway PVI is presented
in Figure 7. One can
immediately note the apparition of an intense peak at around 71 ppm
in the PEGylated sample, being related with the repeating unit of
the PEG polymer. Despite the use of CP mode, the strong intensity
of the peak still indicates the presence of a large amount of PEG
moieties, as also supported by TGA. A mass loss of about 10% was associated
with the PEG grafting (Table S4, PVI step
3). The signals corresponding to the thiol- and amine-active groups
were also detected confirming the stability of both functions during
the PEGylation (see Figure 7). 13C CP ssNMR, coupled with TGA, was also of
prime importance to study the extent and efficiency of the PEGylation
for all the synthesis pathways presented in Scheme 1. Indeed, while CP is not a quantitative
technique, there still exists a clear correlation between the amount
of grafted PEG and the resulting (relative) intensity of the 13C ssNMR signal at 71 ppm, as shown in Figure 8. One can immediately see the impact on the
PEG-related resonance intensity when the grafting strategy is successful
with about 20% of PEG moieties added (PI-3, black line), versus a
synthesis pathway where the grafting did not work well, that is, few
PEG molecules reacted (PV-3, red line). For pathway PI, the intensity
of the PEG signal is so dominant that the spectrum had to be magnified
in order to observe the other resonances related with the carbons
in alpha and beta positions of the thiol groups (inset, Figure 8). These differences in the
grafting efficiency can be correlated with the nature, number, and
dispersion of the functional groups on the surface of the MSNs. In
pathway PI, only thiol functions are present, mostly on the outer
part of the particles, thanks to the DCC process. It results in a
highly effective grafting. On the contrary, in pathway PV, in parallel
to the thiol groups anchored via DCC, amine functionalities were also
added via PG, leading to the presence of both types of function on
the surface. With this surface configuration, PEG-maleimide species
poorly reacted and almost no PEG could be grafted. Nevertheless, as
shown in Figure S9, it is still possible
to react the surface thiols of this sample with fluorescein maleimide
(vide infra). Similar results were obtained with functional MSNs synthesized
following pathways PIX and PX where both APTS and MPTS were post-grafted
and PVIII where APTS was attached via DCC and MPTS was then post-grafted.
In pathways PVII and PVIII, PEGylation seemed to be successful; however,
because very few MPTS groups are present on the surface, only 3% was
grafted. Thus, the problem seems to originate from the proximity of
amine and thiol sites on the surface, ultimately hindering the grafting
procedure of large molecules. This hypothesis is consistent with the
reproducibility issues faced when trying to graft PEG-maleimide to
amine- and thiol-functionalized MSNs synthesized following this pathway
(PV). Different attempts led to inconsistent variations, from 1 to
7%, of mass loss attributed to PEG. Successful grafting and better
reproducibility were found when PEG-maleimide was reacted with MSNs
functionalized with both amine and thiol groups introduced using DCC
(PII); however, here also, only 7% of PEG was grafted according to
TGA (Table S4). These data thus revealed
that the degree of PEG grafting strongly depends on the method used
to anchor the amine groups. When they were introduced either via DCC
or PG, that is, the reactive NH2 groups are mostly located
on the outer region of the particles, the amount of attached PEG was
systematically lower as compared to functionalized MSNs where NH2 groups were introduced via a CC method (PVI), as evidenced
by TGA and in a qualitative way, by the NMR data (Table S4). Moreover, the position of the PEGylation within
the overall functionalization process was found to be of critical
importance. Further functionalization of PEG-grafted MSNs with APTS
(PI-4, Scheme 1) was
ineffective, as TGA revealed no additional mass loss associated with APTS anchoring (Table S4). Furthermore, this sample (PI-4) showed
a poor colloidal stability as compared to PEG-MSNs obtained via PI-3.
This might be due to a cleavage of the PEG-MSNs bond, that is, reaction
of the maleimide cycle with a nucleophile leading to an open carboxylic
acid and amide. Therefore, to obtain an effective reaction, it is
recommended to PEGylate the mesoporous particles only once all of
the primary functional groups, such as −NH2 or −SH
or −COOH and so forth, were already added to the MSNs. Ideally,
the presence of outer surface active groups that are not necessary
for “external” functionalization should be avoided,
and more efficient materials, from a colloid point of view, are synthesized
when amine functionalities are introduced via a CC process (PVI).

The last functionalization concerns the addition
of one or more
bioactive groups (Scheme 1, steps 3 and 4). In the present report, in order to study
in detail the grafting/loading procedure of each active function and
its effects on the overall reactivity of the MSNs, we compare three
main functionalities separately: (i) drug loading/release, (ii) insertion
of a chelate, and (iii) fluorophore grafting, the latter two being
for potential use in medical imaging. The goal is to eventually combine
these capabilities within a single material to generate a theranostic
platform.21−25,29

Drug Adsorption/Release
Tests
To demonstrate that pores
can still be efficiently loaded even if various functionalities were
anchored (including bulky PEG), quercetin, a drug with promising antioxidant
and tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibiter properties,81−83 was loaded in the MSNs prepared following synthesis pathways PII
and PIII. In both cases, the 13C CP ssNMR spectra, presented
in Figure 9, and the
TGA confirmed the sequestration of quercetin without any degradation,
even after extensive washing. About 14 and 18% of quercetin was loaded
following PII and PIII, respectively. The main difference between
these two pathways is the moment when the PEGylation step was performed
in the overall functionalization procedure. In PII, MSNs are first
PEGylated and then loaded with quercetin. In PIII, these two steps
are inverted. Thus, the amount of loaded drug does not heavily depend
on the degree of functionalization because quercetin is a rather small
molecule which can reach the pores of the MSNs even if bulky moieties
are already grafted on the surface. However, from the 13C ssNMR spectra and the TGA results (Table S4), it is obvious that the pathway PIII is not desirable because PEG
moieties are not efficiently grafted. Only 2% of additional mass loss
was attributed to PEG. To exclude significant quercetin leaching during
the PEGylation, infrared spectroscopy measurements were performed
before and after the synthesis (see Figure S10). No change in the absorbance of the peaks related to quercetin
was observed. In case of PII, the drug is clearly seen in the spectrum
after the drug loading (∼1500 cm–1). Similar
to the behavior seen for PI, this result confirms the importance to
control wisely the PEGylation timing within the functionalization
process for the design of MSN nanocarriers. It appears that PII provides
a much more straightforward correlation between the mass loss, and
the different synthesis steps and led to a colloidal stable quercetin-loaded
PEG-MSNs. N2 physisorption analyses presented in Figure S11a enable to evaluate the effects of
each functionalization step on the porosity of the resulting materials
prepared according to PII. One can note the progressive decrease in
the specific surface area and total pore volume (Table S1), which is consistent with the sequential grafting
of PEG and drug loading. The NLDFT mode pore size does not change
after PEGylation, confirming the open access to the pores. As expected,
no porosity is detected after quercetin loading, in line with the
filling of the pores by the drug.

of pure quercetin and
quercetin-loaded MSNs synthesized via pathways PII and PIII.

A simple release test was then
performed in PBS buffer over a period
of 24 h, as presented in Figure 10. The initial concentration of the encapsulated and
free quercetin was set to 50 μg mL–1. The
release/solubility of quercetin was clearly promoted by the encapsulation
into functionalized MSNs, especially during the first 8 h. This result
is of particular significance considering the poor solubility of quercetin
in PBS buffer at pH = 7.484−86 and its poor stability, that
is, about 10 h, in PBS.87 However, no statistical
difference was observed between PII and PIII which leads us to the
assumption that the PEG does not perturb the release of this drug
at pH = 7.4 and merely provides a better colloidal stability to the
system.

Insertion of Gd-Chelates
Grafting of Gd3+ chelates
at the surface of the MSNs enables their tracking in the
blood system, the organs and/or cells using magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI). Paramagnetic Gd-based chelates appear bright in T1-weighted MRI images even at low doses of the chelated
substance. Over the last years, several studies reported MSNs labeled
with Gd chelates for MRI applications.29,64,88−92 Most of them are based on the grafting of DTPA or 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic
acid ligands at the surface of MSNs. Nevertheless, the chemical stability
of such metal chelates in vitro and in vivo is still a matter of discussion,
the detachment and release of free Gd-complex species being of concern.59 In the same way, proper colloidal stability
in the medium of interest is desirable to avoid sedimentation, ultimately
resulting in a non-homogeneous distribution of the particles and thus
in nonrelevant MRI. Herein, DTPA was first grafted via the amine groups
using a reaction scheme described in Figure S12. As shown in Scheme 1, three different pathways were attempted for DTPA anchoring. In
PIV and PV, amine functions were post-grafted onto SH-MSNs obtained
via DCC. Then, DTPA was reacted with the surface NH2 groups,
before (PIV) or after (PV) PEGylation. In both cases, a mass loss
of about 5–7% is detected in TGA (for PIV-3 and PV-4, respectively, Table S4) as well as an increase in nitrogen
and carbon amount by EA (Tables S2 and S3), confirming the successful grafting of DTPA. It roughly corresponds
to a 40% yield with respect to the amount of DTPA introduced. When
considering the amount of grafted APTS, it was estimated that about
50–60% of available amine groups reacted (from TGA), leaving
some opportunities for further reaction. However, as already discussed
above, the amount of PEG grafted in PV-3 is inconsistent from synthesis
to synthesis and usually quite low. It results in a material having
a variable behavior from a colloidal stability point of view which
may be problematic for systematic studies, especially in complex media
such as DMEM. Therefore, while the DTPA grafting procedure is effective,
this synthesis pathway needs more optimization to be considered as
a reliable synthesis route. Unfortunately, PEGylation performed on
DTPA-MSNs (PIV-4) was also found to be ineffective (Table S4) and resulted in neglectable amounts of PEG being
grafted. In this case, we attributed this behavior to a steric hindrance
problem combined with the proximity of available unreacted amine groups
with the thiol ones, as mentioned earlier. This pathway was thus not
further explored. With regards to the results obtained in PV, it was
decided to simplify and optimize the synthesis protocol. This gave
rise to the pathway PVI where APTS is no more post-grafted but rather
introduced in CC. This choice was made in order to avoid the surface
competition between APTS and MPTS which appeared to be an issue. Although
this change resulted in a less ordered pore structure, as seen in Figure 4c, because MPTS is
still added via DCC, the overall synthesis pathway has the great advantage
to provide a material with thiol functions on the external surface
and to keep the overall primary functionalization (−NH2 and −SH) in a one-pot synthesis. Furthermore, avoiding
the PG with APTS allows to get rid of any extra harmful solvent traces
such as toluene. Considering the subsequent PEGylation and DTPA grafting
steps, the only solvent being employed is dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
which is considered biocompatible and non-toxic for humans.93 Following pathway PVI, it was possible to introduce
about 12% w/w of PEG and about 3% of DTPA (Table S4). Success of the two grafting procedures was confirmed by 13C CP ssNMR as shown in Figures 7 and S13. Almost
twice the amount of PEG was grafted, as compared to pathway PV, which
might be attributed to a more selective functionalization of the thiol
active groups. EA showed that the amount of nitrogen for PV-2 was
more than three times higher than for PVI-2 (0.5 vs 1.8 mmol g–1), causing problems for the reaction with PEG, while
the amount of sulfur was nearly similar. In pathway PVI, there should
not be much APTS on the external surface of the MSNs. However, it
is estimated that DTPA molecules reacted with only 25–30% of
the amine reactive sites. This can be explained considering the fact
that not all NH2 groups introduced via CC are accessible.
Some of them might be trapped within the pore walls94 making them inactive for any subsequent chemistry. In addition,
much less amine sites are present on the outer surface of the MSNs,
decreasing the number of easily accessible active sites for large
molecules. The last part of the synthesis was to complex Gd3+ as described in the Experimental Section, but will not be discussed
in detail here. Zeta potential measurements in nanopure water were
in good agreement with the literature29 and showed to be −35 mV before and −24 mV after the
Gd chelation. Most importantly, the NLDFT mode pore size of the MSNs
does not diminish with the PEGylation and the grafting of the DTPA,
confirming that these bulky groups are mostly grafted on the external
surface of the mesoporous silica. Compared to previous work,29 the DTPA was here grafted using a significantly
less harmful solvent, that is, DMSO instead of toluene, and without
the use of a refluxing system, making the procedure noticeably simpler.
Even though the amount of PEG (PVI) was higher (12% vs 5%), the NLDFT
pore size appeared to be the same as previously reported (2.5 nm).
This is a quite remarkable result as it opens the way for further
loading of drugs or other substances of biological interest. As it
will be discussed in the last part below, the colloidal stability
of this sample in various media was also quite remarkable, making
this pathway PVI a very potent one for the production of high quality
multifunctional MSNs for health-related applications.

Fluorophore
Grafting
One way to take advantage of the
residual surface reactive groups is to use them to bring a second
imaging capability to the particles. In this way, organic fluorophores,
rhodamine and fluorescein typically, are particularly interesting
as they are already commonly used for cell and organ labeling.95−97 Rhodamine B isothiocyanate was thus first used. In addition to the
expected reaction with the free amine groups, rhodamine B isothiocyanate
could also react with the thiol functions. Therefore, different pathways
of the grafting procedure were performed as presented in Scheme 1 (PX and PXI). The
presence of the rhodamine was revealed by the pink coloration of the
MSNs, even after extensive washing cycles, and by the UV/vis spectrum
in ethanol which showed a peak at 550 nm for both free and grafted
rhodamine species (Figure 11). The amount of rhodamine grafted, calculated from TGA, was
found to be rather low for PX and PXI (Table S4). However, the particles were nicely colored in both cases, and
an identifiable signal from rhodamine was also detected in the 13C CP ssNMR pattern (Figure S14). A low grafting efficiency for fluorophores should not be a major
issue because a small amount is usually enough to trigger a good imaging
sensitivity.98 Importantly, PX and PXI
highlighted again the influence of the addition order of the different
functionalities. Indeed, PG of MPTS was heavily hampered by the presence
of rhodamine (PXI) and comparable to the effect seen with surface
APTS, and the presence of rhodamine and APTS impaired the PEGylation
reaction (PX). In contrast, it was possible to add one or two fluorophores
on already multifunctionalized materials synthesized according to
pathway VI (PVI-4), as shown in Figure S15. Similar to the observations made for PV (Figure S9), rhodamine and/or fluorescein molecules were successfully
grafted to the PEG- and Gd-DPTA-containing MSNs using some of the
remaining thiol and amine reaction sites. Placing two fluorophores
in one single nanocarrier is of interest, especially when the location
of the added functional groups is different like it is the case in
PVI (CC and DCC).99 Therefore, if one uses
proper functionalization procedures, the resulting materials can easily
combine dual imaging capabilities while still exhibiting interesting
porosity characteristics that can be used for drug loading or other
biological functionalities.

MSNs synthesized
according to PX-3 and PX-2 in EtOH. A photo of the grafted MSNs in
EtOH is provided in the inset.

Stability Tests
Finally, colloidal stability was investigated
using DLS in different media and at different pH values. For these
tests, the most promising synthesis pathway, that is, PVI was selected.
As shown in Figure 12, particles obtained after step PVI-4 were suspended in acidic water
at pH = 2 and pH = 5. Colloidal stability in biological media of interest,
PBS and DMEM in our case, was also studied. The sample was stable
in all media and pH values with an average hydrodynamic diameter of
about 250 nm, being consistent with the data observed for MSNs synthesized
according to PI-3 suspended in water and DMEM (see Figure 6). After 24 h (Figure 12), a maximum standard deviation
of 10% was observed for MSNs (PVI-4) suspended in DMEM. Moreover,
the particles were still stable in the different media after 5 days,
as shown in Figure S16, demonstrating the
adequate colloidal behavior of the platform. No visible aggregation/sedimentation
was found. The variation of the hydrodynamic diameter after 5 days
was rather small in each medium, which indicates that the particles
did not undergo a major change within this timeframe. Therefore, this
material (PVI-4, where amine and thiol groups were added via CC and
DCC, respectively, followed by the sequential PG of PEG, DTPA chelates,
and fluorophores) seems to be a great candidate for future in vitro
and potentially in vivo studies. It can also be concluded that the
PEGylation enhanced dramatically the colloidal behavior of the MSNs,
especially if the PEGylation was performed following the proposed
“optimized” conditions.

different media and pH values over time.

Conclusions
In this work, we demonstrated the importance
of the different MSN
synthesis and functionalization methods and steps in order to produce
the most efficient platform for biorelated applications while preserving
the integrity and the features of the mesopore structure. The following
conclusions can be formulated:It appears favorable to work with MPTS instead of APTS,
especially for “external surface” functionalization.

If two functionalities are to be included,
one should
rather choose CC and DCC routes instead of classical PG.

Subsequent functionalization, such as PEGylation, works
better if the amount of surface amine functions is limited.

In the same way, PEGylation should always
be performed
after initial functionalization with the other silanes.

Furthermore, our results showed that unreacted surface
groups are still available for further grafting of small molecules,
even after dual surface grafting of DTPA and PEG, allowing the synthesis
of a potential multi-imaging capability platform.



The next step will be to perform in-depth in vitro and in
vivo
biological studies with the obtained materials. Furthermore, multi-imaging
testing could be implemented, noticeably by combining MRI and fluorescence
imaging. Also, because one of the fluorophores could be more distributed
on the outer shell of the particles, whereas the other is distributed
homogeneously through the entire particle, it could be of great interest
to follow, for example, the details in the degradation of the material
in different media. Finally, one could also think about extending Scheme 1 by including more
functionalities, like halide groups, that may be used for further
chemical modifications. However, it has to be kept in mind that the
order and the method of functionalization appear to be crucial regarding
the final material properties and pore ordering. From a synthesis
point of view, the results described here may also be extended and
extrapolated to other siliceous particle systems where surface versus
core differentiation is mandatory, ultimately allowing an optimal
and logical (nano)carrier design.

Materials and Methods
TEOS (98%), n-cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB,
99%), Pluronic F127 (EO106PO70EO106, BioReagent), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic dianhydride (DTPA dianhydride,
98%), APTS (99%), MPTS (95%), Gd(CH3CO2)3·xH2O (99.9%), PEG maleimide
(MW 5000), absolute toluene, PBS, acetic acid, hydrochloric acid (37%),
rhodamine B isothiocyanate, fluorescein-5-maleimide, and DMEM (without
glucose, l-glutamine, phenol red, sodium pyruvate, and sodium
bicarbonate) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Austria) in high purity
grade. Absolute ethanol, EtOH (94–96%), DMSO, sodium acetate,
and ammonium hydroxide, NH4OH (28–30%), were purchased
from Alfa Aesar (Austria).

Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles
MCM-48 silica nanoparticles
were synthesized as reported in the literature.26 Briefly, 0.5 g CTAB (1.37 mmol), 2 g Pluronic F127, and
33.5 g absolute ethanol were stirred at 1000 rpm in a polypropylene
(PP) bottle at room temperature. After complete dissolution and at
least 30 min, 106.5 mL of a freshly prepared 2.9 wt % NH4OH solution was added at once. The obtained reaction mixture
was stirred overnight at 1000 rpm (pH = 11.9). Then, 1.8 g TEOS was
added in one shot using a PP beaker. The solution was stirred for
1 more minute at 1000 rpm. After that, it was aged at room temperature
in static conditions for 24 h. The resulting white powder was collected
by centrifugation, washed with water and ethanol, and left open on
a bench for drying overnight at room temperature. Finally, the material
was calcined at 550 °C for 5 h (1 °C min–1) or chemically extracted using the following procedure: the obtained
particles were filled in a 250 mL round-bottom flask equipped with
a Dimroth cooling system, followed by the addition of 150 mL of technical
EtOH and 1.5 mL of HCl (37%). The obtained mixture was stirred at
90 °C overnight. Then, the mixture was allowed to cool down to
room temperature and centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 20 min.
Then, the particles were washed with water (approx. 200 mL) to remove
remaining HCl and with the same amount of EtOH. This procedure was
repeated for three times followed by drying the final material overnight
in an oven at 45 °C.

MSN Functionalization
Functionalized
MSNs were obtained
via three different techniques: CC, DCC, and PG.19,26 For CC, the synthesis steps are the same as described above except
that the selected organo-silane was mixed with TEOS in a PP beaker
and added at once to the synthesis. For DCC, the reaction was carried
in a similar way as for the synthesis of MSNs except that after 10
min of aging at room temperature, the synthesis is stirred back at
1000 rpm. Immediately after, the silane was added at once to the solution.
The mixture is then stirred for another minute and aged at room temperature
for 24 h. For PG, the nanoparticles were first degassed under vacuum
overnight at 80 °C if grafting was performed on already functionalized
materials or at 150 °C for pristine MSNs. Nanoparticles were
then suspended in absolute toluene at 80 °C (for already functionalized
material) or 110 °C (for MSNs) under inert atmosphere. After
3 h, the silane was added and the mixture was stirred for 4 h. The
amount of added silane was 0.1 molar equivalent as compared to TEOS
for CC and DCC, and 4 or 12 mmol g–1 of degassed
particles for PG. Washing, template removal, drying, and collection
of the functionalized samples were performed exactly as described
for the chemically extracted MSNs.

PEGylation
mPEG-maleimide
was reacted with the thiol
groups of MPTS.100 Briefly, the nanoparticles
(0.15 g) were suspended in 10 mL of nanopure water. After stirring
at 1000 rpm overnight, 1 mL of PBS (pH 7.4) was added. Then, a mass
equivalent amount of mPEG-maleimide (0.15 g) was added to the solution
and stirred overnight at room temperature. The resulting product was
collected by centrifugation and washed three times with water, followed
by drying for at least 12 h at room temperature.

Drug Loading
Quercetin was loaded inside the (functionalized)
MSNs using the rotavapor technique.101 Briefly,
20 mg (=20 wt %) quercetin was dissolved in absolute ethanol followed
by the addition of 80 mg nanoparticles. The mixture was kept in an
ultrasonic bath for at least 1 h. Finally, the ethanol was slowly
evaporated using a Buchi rotary evaporator Interface I-100 (pressure
difference 50 mbar/step/5 min). The drug solubilization/release test
was performed in triplicates in PBS buffer over a period of 24 h.
Briefly, 10 mg of particles and 30 mL PBS buffer (=50 μg mL–1) were added in a centrifuge tube and put on a walker
at 80 rpm. After a specific period of time, the samples were centrifuged
for 5 min at 9000 rpm, and 2 mL of the supernatant was removed. For
control purposes, a solubilization test of free quercetin over time
was also performed. The drug (1.5 mg) was directly added to 30 mL
PBS buffer. The concentration of solubilized drug was then measured
by using a UV/vis spectrometer (Onda Spectrophotometer, 800–200
nm), and the measured solution was returned to the PBS buffer. The
calibration was performed before each set of measurements using 5
standard solutions (10–1 μg mL–1) and
treated in the same way as described above.

DTPA[Gd] Chelate
Approximately 0.15 g nanoparticles
was suspended in 4 mL of DMSO followed by the addition of half a mass
equivalent of DTPA (0.075 g). After stirring overnight at room temperature,
the material was washed with approximately 10 mL of DMSO (twice) and
with 10 mL of distilled water (three times). After washing, the material
was dried in an oven at 45–50 °C. The obtained material
was then added to 15 mL of a 100 mM gadolinium acetate solution in
water (1 mL/10 mg particle) and stirred for 1 h to allow the complexation
of Gd ions. Finally, the particles were washed two times with approx.
10 mL of an acetate buffer solution (NaOAc/AcOH, 0.1 M, pH = 5) and
twice with the same amount of water. The resulting DTPA[Gd] grafted
material was dried overnight in an oven at 45 °C.

DLS and Zeta
Potential
Stable aqueous suspensions of
the material (0.7 mg mL–1) were obtained by performing
three cycles of vortex shaking (10 min) and ultrasonic bath treatment
(20 min). The supernatant was then analyzed for hydrodynamic diameters
and zeta potential values using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS. Measurements
were accepted as valid only when satisfactory quality criteria such
a polydispersity index and steepness of the correlogram function were
fulfilled. For long-term colloidal stability, tests were performed
in different media (water, buffer solutions for pH 2, 5, and 8, and
PBS buffer). In between tests, the samples were kept in the cuvettes
in static conditions, and no further mixing or vortex was used.

Thermogravimetric Analysis
The measurements were performed
using a Netsch STA 449-F3 Jupiter analyzer, from room temperature
to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1. An air flow of 20 mL min–1 and an additional
protective N2 flow of 20 mL min–1 were
used. The percentage of grafted moieties was calculated based on the
detected mass loss between 150 and 800 °C.

Nitrogen Physisorption
Analyses at −196 °C
Nitrogen physisorption analyses
at −196 °C were performed
with a Quantachrome iQ3 instrument (Anton Parr, Boynton Beach, USA).
Prior to the measurements, the samples were outgassed under vacuum
overnight at 150 °C for pure silica material and at 80 °C
for functionalized particles. The specific surface area (SBET) was obtained using the BET equation in the range
of 0.05–0.15 P/P0. The total pore volume was determined at P/P0 = 0.95 according to the Gurvitch rule, and
the pore size analysis was calculated using the equilibrium NLDFT
model, assuming a cylindrical pore geometry and a silica surface.
Calculations were performed with the ASiQwin software v.5.0 provided
by Quantachrome.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
The nanoparticles
were dispersed in ethanol by using an ultrasonic bath and further
deposited on a carbon-coated copper grid. Images were taken with a
Philips CM200 transmission electron microscope at an accelerating
voltage of 200 keV in bright-field mode. Micrographs were acquired
using a Gatan Orius CCD camera with an exposure time of 1 s field.

Solid-State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
The
spectra were obtained on a Bruker AVANCE NEO 500 wide bore system
(Bruker BioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany) using a 4 mm triple resonance
magic angle spinning (MAS) probe. The resonance frequency for 13C NMR was 125.78 MHz, and the MAS rotor spinning was set
to 14 kHz. CP was achieved by a ramped contact pulse with a contact
time of 2 ms. During acquisition, 1H was high power decoupled
using SPINAL with 64 phase permutations. The chemical shifts for 13C are reported in ppm and are referenced external to adamantane
by setting the low field signal to 38.48 ppm.

Powder X-ray Diffraction
The low-angle diffractograms
of MSNs were recorded on a PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer (Malvern
PANanalytical, United Kingdom) in reflection geometry (Bragg–Brentano
HD) using Cu Kα1+2 radiation operated at a voltage
of 45 kV, a tube current of 40 mA, and with a fixed divergence slit
of 0.05 mm. Measurements were performed in continuous mode with a
step size 2 theta of 0.013° and a time per step of 300 s. The
low-angle XRD pattern of sample PXI-3 was recorded in transmission
geometry in continuous mode with a step size 2θ of 0.013°,
a time per step of 250 s, and with a fixed divergence slit of 0.76
mm.

Elemental Analysis
EA on C, H, N, and S was done using
a Eurovector EA3000 CHNS-O analyzer. The method has been proven to
be capable of detecting the organic modifications on various silica
materials with the usual accuracy and precision. The uncertainty is
below 0.2 wt % for carbon at 20 wt %. The sample amount weighed for
an analysis was between 3.5 and 5.0 mg when a sufficient sample amount
was available.

Attenuated Total Reflectance Infrared Spectroscopy
Attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectra were measured
with a Bruker Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer equipped with Specac Golden
Gate ATR accessory. Each spectrum was gathered from the acquisition
of 72 scans at 4 cm–1 resolution varied from 4000
to 500 cm–1. A new background spectrum gathered
from the acquisition of 72 scans at 4 cm–1 resolution
was collected before running each sample. All samples were dried at
40 °C before the measurements.
