An ordered array
of 1D ZnO nanorods obtained by colloidal templating
is shown to dramatically enhance the sensing response of NOx at room temperature by confining light and creating
periodic structures. The sensitivity is measured for a concentration
varying from 2 to 10 ppm (response 53% at 10 ppm) at room temperature
under white light illumination with ≈225 nm hole diameter.
In contrast, structures with ≈450 nm hole size show better
sensing under (response 98% at 10 ppm) elevated temperatures in dark
conditions, which is attributed to the increased surface chemical
interactions with NOx molecules due to
the porous nature and enhanced accessible surface area of ZnO nanorods.
Further, the decoration of ZnO Nanorods with gold nanoparticles shows
enhanced sensor performance (response 130% at 10 ppm) due to localized
surface plasmon resonance under white light illumination. The findings
may lead to new opportunities in the visible light-activated room-temperature
NOx sensors for healthcare applications.

1 Introduction
Detection
of nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2) is important,
as toxic gases released from automobiles and thermal power plants
have detrimental effects on human health, which include severe respiratory
diseases and irritation of the skin.1,2 Amongst all
metal oxides such as SnO2,3 ZrO2,4 V2O5,5 WO3,6 NiO,7 and ZnO,8 various
ZnO nanostructures have been widely utilized for sensing NOx gases, as environment friendly ZnO possesses high
electron mobility along with superior chemical and thermal stability.
However, most of the ZnO-based NOx sensors
fail to operate at room temperature owing to the transfer of electrons
from the conduction band to the surface-adsorbed oxygen, which in
turn leads to the reduction of the conductance of the semiconductor.
This bottleneck is circumvented by making the device operate at elevated
temperatures (typically between 50 and 450 °C), as the intrinsic
conductance increases linearly with temperature.9,10 However,
the high-temperature detection is incompatible with low power sensor
circuitry and also suffers from possible detection-induced flammability
and consequently, significant research efforts are being devoted toward
the development of NOx sensors operating
at room temperature.

Light-driven gas sensing is a promising
approach for room-temperature
sensing due to the absence of flammability and associated hazards,
as well as long-term stability because high-temperature devices are
prone to degradation caused by diffusion and sintering effects. Previously,
UV illumination (wavelength ≈ 200–400 nm)-driven room-temperature
NOx sensors have been fabricated with
ZnO11 and other metal oxides semiconductors.12−14 However, UV-assisted NOx sensing is
energy consuming (solar UV radiation contains only ∼5–7%
of the total energy), expensive, and also harmful for human skin and
eyes. For obvious reasons, nonhazardous visible light (wavelength
≈ 400–700 nm)-activated NOx sensors that can be operated using solar illumination (∼43%
visible), fluorescent lamp, indoor illumination, visible light-emitting
diodes (LEDs), and so forth are desirable. However, the development
of room-temperature white light (UV–visible)-activated sensors
is in the nascent stage. Recently, toxic heavy metal cadmium sulfide
(CdS)-based thin films, nanoflakes,15 and
heterojunction (ZnO/CdS)-based visible and UV–visible activated
NOx sensors have been reported.16−18 Environmentally benign metal oxide-based visible light-activated
NOx sensors can be fabricated by reducing
the band gap using self-doping with oxygen vacancies in metal oxides
such as ZnO,19 NiO,20 WO3,21 and fabricating
binary composites of oxygen self-doped metal oxides such as CuxO1–y@ZnO1−α22 and rGO–ZnO1–x.23 However, self-doping-based
oxygen vacancies in metal oxides extend the band gap limitedly toward
the visible wavelength and the fabrication process is complex and
expensive, involving techniques such as arc melting at high temperature
(∼3000 °C) and ultrafast cooling in the reducing atmosphere.19,24 Lu et al. have fabricated visible light-activated NO2 sensors operating at room temperature using the 3D inverse opal-based
(3D IO) In2O3–ZnO heterogeneous composite
microsphere (HCM).25 However, 3D IO-based
architecture using In2O3–ZnO 3D IO HCM
shows the poor extension of light response at the visible wavelength
region (∼400–700 nm), and the role of porosity for retarding
light response has not been studied.

In this work, we have selectively
fabricated organized ZnO 1D structures
to enhance gas sensing performance at room temperature by trapping
low-intensity (400 μW/cm2) white light. Hexagonal
close-packed monolayer array of polystyrene (PS) colloids with different
particle diameters (dp) has been used as a template to grow 1D
ZnO nanorods hydrothermally on radio frequency (RF)-sputtered ZnO
thin films. Our experiment shows that ZnO nanorods were grown
with dp = 600 nm colloids (structure identified as Z450) show superior response at an elevated temperature (200 °C).
In contrast, the best response at room temperature under low-intensity
white light is observed when the nanorods are grown using dp = 300
nm colloids (Z225). While the maximum accessible
area in the Z450 structure is responsible for sensing
at elevated temperatures in dark, enhanced light trapping in the Z225 structure is responsible for sensing at room temperature
under low-intensity white light. Further, we used solid-state dewetting-mediated
uniform deposition of Au nanoparticles for extending the absorption
wavelength further toward the visible region to achieve rapid and
higher response for Z225 samples that shows a response
time of 110 s and a decay time of 100 s. The study shows that the
resonant plasmonic effect of Au nanoparticles leading to strong absorption
at the visible band, along with the scattering and local field enhancement26−28 can be effectively utilized to overcome the limitation of ZnO-based
sensors operating at room temperature.

2 Results
and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of vertically
aligned ZnO nanorods grown without the template as the control sample
in Figure 1a and with
UVO-mediated colloidal transfer-printed PS templates in Figure 1b–d on ZnO/indium tin
oxide (ITO)/glass substrates. The average diameter and length of the
nanorods are found to be ∼80 nm and ∼1.0 μm,
respectively, after a growth time of 4.5 h. ZnO nanorods exhibit a
hexagonal regular structure all over the substrate, as shown in Figure 1a–d. In order
to obtain well-oriented ZnO nanorod samples, three types of PS colloids
with diameters dp = 300, 600, and 800 nm were used, The growth of
well-oriented porous ZnO nanorods solely depends on the hexagonal
close-packed arrangement of monolayer colloidal crystals, as well
as the infiltration of the nutrient solution in the interior interstices
of the colloid templates. Figure 1b–d shows the images of ZnO nanorods prepared
over the contour of ordered periodic spherical holes of an average
diameter of ∼225, ∼450, and ∼640 nm, respectively
and consequently, these samples are designated hereafter as Z225, Z450, and Z640, respectively.
ZnO nanorods grown with colloidal templates reveal aligned nanostructures
with the porous surface up to a height that matches the dp of the
colloids used that is 300 nm for Z225, 600 nm for Z450, and 800 nm for Z640 samples. Beyond this
height, it becomes smooth similar to generic hexagonal growth of ZnO
nanorods. In case of a colloidal template, the growth of ZnO nanorods
occurs along the contours of the spheres, which differs from the conventional
nanosphere lithography mask-based vapor phase deposition techniques
where the growth takes place over the interstices of the mask only.29,30 The average diameter of ZnO nanorods grown using the colloidal templates
is found to be ∼45 ± 5, ∼80 ± 4, and ∼80
± 5 nm for Z225, Z450, and Z640 samples, respectively. The diameter of ZnO nanorods (∼80
nm) in Z450 (Figure 1c) and Z640 (Figure 1d) samples are identical to the control sample
(∼80 nm, Figure 1a), which may be attributed to the unperturbed colloidal contour
oriented growth of ZnO nanorods in Z450 and Z640 samples as adequate space in adjacent colloids were available for
growth. Following the growth of nanorods, the average hole radius
in all samples is found to be approximately 25% lower than that of
the initial PS sphere diameter. Near identical percentage shrinkage
of the spheres irrespective of the dp of the colloids is attributed
to the same rate of decomposition and vaporization of PS colloids
during the hydrothermal process. In order to quantify the rate of
decomposition and vaporization of PS colloids as well as the subsequent
growth of ZnO nanorods, we have specifically prepared ZnO nanorods
using 600 nm (Z450) PS colloidal templates at different
growth times and is shown in Figure 2.

spheres and ZnO nanorods length as a function of time during hydrothermal
growth.

Figure 2 shows the
images of ZnO nanorods grown using the 600 nm PS colloid template
at different growth times. It is observed that the growth of ZnO is
initiated from the contour of PS colloids, and it follows voids of
the colloids with increasing growth time. The percentage shrinkage
of diameter and length of the nanorods has been estimated using ImageJ
(version 1.50 e) software, which is shown in Figure 2e. The colloid diameter is shrunk from 600
to 450 nm, which is nearly 25% after 4.5 h of ZnO nanorods growth
as shown in statistical estimation in Figure 2e. It is also confirmed from Figure 1b–e that the diameter
shrinkage rate after 4.5 h of hydrothermal growth using dp = 300 nm  and 800 nm  is nearly equal to dp = 600 nm sample.
This observation confirms that following the removal of the colloidal
template, hole diameters can be controlled using the initial colloids
diameter, nutrient concentration, and time of growth of ZnO nanorods
in a particular hydrothermal growth condition.

Figure 3a,b shows
the images of Au-decorated Z225 structures prepared using
the thermal solid-state dewetting method.31 The deposition of Au NPs on ZnO NRs by thermal evaporation has been
used to ensure the purity of the metals as well as the control of
the size distribution and the density of NPs by controlling initial
metal film thickness and annealing temperature. FESEM images reveal
the formation of Au NPs with a diameter range of ∼10–50
nm, which is anchored on the surface of ZnO NRs. The low magnification
image in Figure 3a
confirms the high density of Au NPs deposited on the surface of the
nanorods, while the high magnification image of Figure 3b reveals the deposition of Au NPs uniformly
on the side surface as well as the top of the nanorods.

low and (b) high magnification.

In order to investigate the optical properties of as-prepared
ordered
ZnO structures, structure-dependent transmission and photoluminescence
(PL) spectra were studied at room temperature. Figure 4a illustrates the spectra of ZnO nanorods
grown on colloidal templates and flat ZnO seed layer surfaces (control),
revealing a broad transmission dip in the UV range due to strong absorption.
The ordered samples show a significant decrement in transmission in
comparison to control ZnO nanorods grown on the flat surface. It is
observed from the spectra that the Z225 sample exhibits
negligible transmission at the absorption edge of ZnO in comparison
to other samples, which is likely due to the enhanced light trapping
within the structures. Upon decreasing the colloidal diameter down
to the subwavelength range, it becomes possible to confine the light
within the structures leading to increase in the absorption of ZnO.32,33

and control samples. (b) PL spectra of different diameter ZnO 1D nanostructures
using colloid templates along with the control sample. (c) Z225/Au
NP samples annealed at different temperatures.

PL spectra of the control and ordered ZnO nanorod
samples are shown
in Figure 4b. The spectra
display two prominent peaks: one in the UV region attributed to the
band edge (BE) emission of ZnO and other in the visible region owing
to the intrinsic defects of ZnO. BE emission is found to be enhanced
in ordered ZnO samples because the ratio of UV to defect emission
intensity gets enhanced for Z225 (∼0.87), Z450 (∼0.59), and for Z640 (∼0.69) samples, as compared to the controlled
one (∼0.36). A large enhancement in the Z225 structure is primarily attributed to the increased charge
generation and recombination within the nanorods due to light trapping.
It is also observed that the position of BE is red-shifted for ordered
ZnO samples as compared to the control structure because of the changed
dimension of nanorods. The visible emission can be attributed to the
multiple point defects presents in ZnO such as Zn and O vacancies
(VZn and VO), Zn and O interstitials (Zni and Oi), and antisites (OZn and ZnO), similar to earlier observation by Gogurla et al.27 Four emission peaks are associated with single-ionized
oxygen vacancies (VO+) at 523 nm, doubly ionized
oxygen vacancies (VO++) at 585 nm, oxygen interstitial
(Oi) at 657 nm, and an infrared tail at 759 nm due to transition
from complex defects.

This phenomenon along with PL enhancement
at BE suggests that optical
path length can significantly be enhanced by subwavelength dimensional
nanosphere-assisted growth of nanorods. Z450 samples
show relatively low emission compared to other ordered samples due
to the low density of nanorods and increased hole diameters, which
results in high transmission and low absorption. Based on this observation Z225, Z450, and control samples are chosen to
be explored for further measurement as light trapping-based sensors.

Figure 4c shows
the absorption spectra of different temperature-annealed (150, 250,
350, and 450 °C) Au thin films over Z225 structures.
The spectra display absorption in the UV and visible regions. The
visible band prominent in 350 and 450 °C is attributed to the
localized surface plasmon (LSPR) effect of Au nanoparticles after
solid-state dewetting of Au thin films.31 The LSPR band is more prominent in the Z225/Au NP samples
annealed at 350 and 450 °C and the same is less prominent and
red-shifted for samples with unannealed and annealed at 150 and 250
°C temperatures, respectively. The absorption characteristics
in the wavelength range of 350–450 nm remain unaltered for Z225/Au NP and Z225 samples, which suggest that
no further evolution of ZnO nanostructures following Au NP incorporation.

2.1 Gas Sensing Performance Evaluation
The testing of samples
for gas sensing has been carried out under
both dark and illumination at room and elevated temperatures. Temperature-dependent
and light-induced gas sensing at room temperature have been carried
upon exposure to several gases such as NOx and other volatile organic compounds by measuring sensor resistance.
In order to reduce the energy consumption, the effect of both temperature
and white light together has not been investigated for sensing. The
sensors were initially exposed to dry air for 20 min to stabilize
the baseline resistance. The sensor response (S) of NOx is calculated from the relation27 1   where RNOx is the resistance of the
film in the presence
of NOx gas and Rair is the film resistance in the presence of dry air.

Figure 5a,b shows
the semilogarithmic plots of the I–V characteristics of all ordered ZnO devices along with
the control one under dark and illuminated conditions. It is observed
that the Z225 and Z450 structures exhibit
significantly low dark currents in comparison to the control nanorod
device (Figure 5a,b).
The reduction in dark current for Z225 and Z450 devices is mainly due to the rough nature of nanorods, which increases
the adsorption of oxygen molecules on the surface. The current increases
for all devices under light illumination, indicating the photoconductive
response. Interestingly, it is found that the photocurrent enhances
for Z225 and Z450 devices over the control
one. The photo-to-dark current ratio (Iph/Id) is found to be 6 × 103, 0.75 × 103, and 0.36 × 103 at −5
V for Z225, Z450, and control devices, respectively.
An enhancement in the Z225 device is observed under both
the forward and reverse bias conditions in the presence of light as
compared to Z450 and control samples. Enhancement in
a photo-to-dark (Iph/Id) current ratio of 2 and 16 is observed for Z450 and Z225 samples over the control device, respectively.
This enhanced photoresponse for Z450 and Z225 devices is owing to the higher collection rate of captured and photogenerated
electrons in ZnO as compared to the control sample. The enhanced photoresponse
of the Z225 device in comparison to the Z450 one is attributed to the improved light confinement in the structures,
as observed in the transmittance spectra. It is known that the photogenerated
electrons and excess electrons from the adsorbed oxygen mainly contribute
to the photoconductivity of ZnO. The porous nature of ZnO nanorods
in ordered structures can lead to the higher adsorption of oxygen
molecules resulting in excess electrons in the devices. In addition,
an enhanced light trapping in the Z225 device further
boosts its photoresponse due to the subwavelength structures. Moreover,
the photo-to-dark ratio is nearly the same under 325 nm LASER and
white light illumination, which signifies that Z225, Z450, and control samples are well responsive under white
light. Therefore, photogenerated and excess electrons can be effectively
used to interact with NOx molecules for
operating the sensors at room temperature under white light illumination.
The dynamic response and recovery of the Z225 device
is further enhanced by the decoration of Au nanoparticles on its surface.
The incorporation of Au nanoparticles results in a combinatorial effect
of nanoparticle-induced scattering of incoming white light, catalytic
activation for the dissociation of oxygen molecules, and LSPR-induced
UV–visible absorption in Z225 structures. The
improved photoabsorption signifies an increase in the number of interacting
photogenerated electrons toward NOx molecules. Figure 5c shows the semilogarithmic
plot of the I–V characteristics
of Z225/Au NP and Z225 sensors under dark
and 100 mW/cm2 white light illumination. The photo-to-dark
current ratio of Z225/Au NP (Iph/Id ≈ 5.8 × 104) is observed to be enhanced 10 times in comparison to Z225 sensors (Iph/Id ≈ 6 × 103). A slight decrease in dark
current in Z225/Au NP sensors might be attributed to
the increment of low conductivity depletion region, as Au NPs with
a higher work function (∼5.1 eV) withdraw electrons from the Z225 surface having a relatively low work function of ∼4.1
eV. In the presence of white light, electrons are excited to the surface
plasmon band of Au NPs and under the decay process, high-energy LSPR
induced generated free electrons are transferred to the conduction
band of Z225. Additionally, photogenerated holes migrate
toward Au nanoparticles due to the interactive Coulombic attraction
leading to trapping at the Au NP and Z225 Schottky barrier
interface, which results in the interaction of a large number of electrons
with NOx molecules under white light illumination.

(a) 100 mW/cm2 white light and (b) 48 mW/cm2 325 nm laser illumination. (c) Current–voltage characteristics
of Z225/Au NP under 100 mW/cm2 white light

Figure 6a1–a3
shows the dynamic response–recovery curves of template-assisted
grown ZnO nanorods and control sensors for different concentrations
of NOx exposure in dry air, under white
light illumination with a power of 400 μw/cm2. The
response also shows a gradual increase with the concentration of NOx. As seen in figure, the sensors show a significant
change in the response even at a low part-per-million concentration
levels for all devices. Moreover, the Z225 sensor shows
4 times increment in sensing response in comparison to the control
device upon exposure to 10 ppm NOx. Figure 6b shows the response
as a function of NOx concentration for
all devices, indicating a gradual increase with the concentration
of NOx. This observation suggests that
the Z225 sensor has an improved sensing response due
to the enhanced light trapping effect. We know that the oxygen species
(O2–, O–, and O2–) adsorb on the ZnO surface by capturing
free electrons and create a low conductive depletion layer under dry
air conditions. In the presence of white light, the electron–hole
pairs are generated in ZnO nanorods (Figure 6c), and the photogenerated holes migrate to
the surface to decrease the width of the depletion layer by desorbing
the oxygen molecules. This results in a decrement of the resistance
for sensors under illumination. Here, the photogenerated and excess
electrons from adsorbed oxygen (Figure 6d) mainly contribute to the photocurrent. The electronegative
NOx molecules which have a tendency to
withdraw electrons from the n-type semiconductor surface easily interacts
with the photogenerated electrons at the ZnO semiconductor surface
leading to the decrease of conductance and increase of resistance
of the sensors (Figure 6e).

condition, (d) under dry air, and (e) NOx gas in dry air.

The sensing mechanism
can be stated using the following reactions  2   3  

Upon switching off the NOx gas, the
resistance of the sensor decreases due to the abundance of free electrons
generated under illumination. The enhanced sensing response for the Z225 sensor might be attributed to the increased photoelectron
generation due to improved light confinement in the structures. The
observed results suggest that the light confinement in subwavelength
ordered nature of the ZnO sensors can be effectively used to enhance
the gas sensing performance. The mechanism involved in this light-induced
sensing is quite different than that for high-temperature sensing.34 Apart from the light-induced room-temperature
sensing, the devices were also tested at high temperature in dark
conditions to investigate the effect of porosity of the sensing material
in the presence of gas. The optimum temperature has been found to
be 200 °C.

Figure 7a1–a3
shows the dynamic sensing response–recovery curves of template-assisted
grown ZnO nanorods and control devices under different concentrations
of NOx exposure in dry air at 200 °C.
The timing pulse of 10 min “ON” and 10 min “OFF”
is retained based on the steady-state response of the sensors at 2
ppm NOx exposure at dry air conditions
(Figure S2 of the online Supporting Information) during the dynamic response–recovery measurements. The response
of all devices shows a gradual increase upon exposure to NOx, as shown in Figure 7b. The response is found to be enhanced by a factor
of 1.21 for Z225 (∼77.7%) and 1.53 for Z450 (∼98%), as compared to the control one (∼64%) upon
exposure to 10 ppm NOx gas at 200 °C.
The enhancement for ordered ZnO sensors can be well understood from
the porous nature of the nanostructures in comparison to control samples.
Because of the porosity and enhanced surface area of nanorods, a large
number of NOx molecules are adsorbed on
the surface, which results in a higher sensing response for Z225 and Z450 sensors than the control sample.
Furthermore, the decoration of Au nanoparticles using solid-state
dewetting creates a higher density of electrons in the ordered semiconductor
surface under visible light illumination, which results in rapid and
improved gas sensing response at room temperature.

Figure 8a shows
the dynamic response–recovery curves of Au nanoparticle-decorated
nanorod sensors under different concentrations of NOx exposure in dry air, under white light illumination with a
power of 400 μW/cm2. The decoration of Au NPs on
light trapping Z225 samples (Z225/Au NP)
exhibits a rapid and higher response (130% at 10 ppm) under illumination
in comparison to the control Z225 structure.

illumination and (d) under NOx gas in

Figure 8b shows
the response of Z225/Au NP sensors to six different gases
under the same concentration of 10 ppm under white light illumination.
It is observed that sensors show a higher response to NOx and lower response to DCB, acetone, toluene, ethanol,
and CO. The response of NOx gas is almost
42.5 times higher in comparison to DCB vapor for Z225/Au NP sensors (Figure 8b) and 4.8 times to DCB for Z225 sensors (Figure S2
of the online Supporting Information) in
the presence of white light. This observation suggests that ordered
ZnO nanostructures decorated with solid-state dewetted Au nanoparticles
can be used for highly selective NOx sensors
under low-intensity white light conditions. The lowest detection limit
of NOx using Z225/Au NP sensors
can be estimated using criteria for minimum percentage response detectable
to be 1.35 The estimated limit of detection
has been found to be approximately 550 ppb. The calculated detection
limit suggests the potential of low concentration NOx gas detection using Z225/Au NP sensors at room
temperature under low-intensity white light illumination.

Au
nanoparticle decoration on the surface of Z225 forms
the localized metal–semiconductor Schottky junction followed
by surface band bending as shown in band diagram Figure 8c. Under white light illumination,
LSPR-induced hot electrons are spatially transferred toward the Z225 surface, resulting in a large number of oxygen species
(O2–, O–, and O2–) to be adsorbed on the ZnO surface by
capturing free electrons, which enhances low conductive depletion
layer width under dry air conditions. Here, the photogenerated hot
electrons from Au along with ZnO and excess electrons from adsorbed
oxygen mainly contribute to the photocurrent, so the electronegative
NOx molecules can interact with the photogenerated
electrons (Figure 8d). This increases the resistance in the sensor as shown in Figure 8a. The resistance
again decreases in the sensor when we switch off the NOx gas. The enhanced sensing response for the Z225/Au NP sensor under white light illumination might be
attributed to the increased photoelectron generation due to nanoparticle-induced
scattering of incoming white light, which catalytically activate the
dissociation of oxygen molecules and LSPR induced UV–visible
absorption in the light-trapping Z225 structures.

The performance of the ordered Au-decorated ZnO sensors is comparable
or superior to those previously reported visible light-sensitive room-temperature
NOx sensors, as shown in Table 1.

3 Conclusions
We have fabricated colloidal sphere-assisted
selectively arranged
1D ZnO nanorods of different diameters on ITO/glass substrates. The
performances of ordered 1D ZnO nanorod structures as NOx sensors under light illumination at room temperature
and higher temperature under dark conditions have been investigated.
The sensor fabricated using the template of PS colloids with a diameter
of 300 nm (Z225) has shown improved gas sensing response
(53% at 10 ppm) in comparison to other sensors operated at room temperature
under white light illumination. This observation suggests that the
light trapping mechanism and selectively ordered structure can be
effectively used to design low power sensors operating at room temperature.
On the other hand, ZnO nanorods grown on the template of PS colloids
with a diameter of 600 nm (Z450) have shown improved
gas sensing response (98% at 10 ppm) in comparison to other sensors
operated at an optimum temperature of 200 °C in dark conditions.
This observation signifies that the enhanced accessible area due to
the low density of nanorods as well as higher surface to volume ratio
of the 1D structure results in superior sensing response in Z450 samples. Further, the decoration of plasmonic Au NPs
on light-trapping Z225 samples (Z225/Au NP) lead to a rapid and enhanced response (130% at 10 ppm) under visible
light illumination.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of ZnO Seed Layer on ITO Substrate
In order
to prepare the ZnO seed layer, stripped ITO coated glass
(Sigma-Aldrich, 15–25 Ω/sq) of 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm pieces
was taken as the substrate. ITO substrates were cleaned using sequential
ultrasonication and boiling in solvents. Acetone and the mixed solvent
containing water, ammonium hydroxide solution, and hydrogen peroxide
in the 5:1:1 ratio was used as solvents for cleaning. Cleaned substrates
were dried in ambient conditions using N2 stream. A ∼30
nm thin film of the ZnO seed layer was deposited on the substrates
using RF magnetron sputtering from a 3 in. diameter ZnO target. The
deposition took place at a substrate temperature of 200 °C in
the Ar and O2 mixture ratio of 2:1. An RF power of 25 W
and working pressure of 0.02 mbar were maintained during 30 min of
deposition time.

4.2 Generating Hexagonal Close
Pack on ZnO Seed
Layer/ITO Substrate
Hexagonal close-packed (HCP) monolayer
colloids were generated from monodispersed colloidal water suspension
(concentration of about ∼10% wt) of PS spheres (Scheme 1, step 1). Spheres with a mean
diameter of dp = 300 nm (Z225), dp = 600 nm (Z450), and dp = 800 nm (Z640) were used for differently
ordered HCP samples of monolayer colloidal crystals. The array was
placed on the ZnO seed layer-coated ITO glass by UVO—mediated
colloidal transfer printing, reported elsewhere.40−42

Films
4.3 Creating
Ordered ZnO Nanorod Arrays
The growth mechanism of ZnO nanorods
on the RF-sputtered ZnO thin
film is shown schematically in step 2, Scheme 1. In brief, the ZnO nanorods were prepared
by placing monolayer colloidal crystals on ZnO/ITO/glass substrates
in a hydrothermal chamber containing 60 mL millipore aqueous solution
of 1:1 0.025 M of zinc nitrate hexahydrate and hexamethylenetetramine
kept at 90 °C for 4.5 h. Prior to this, seed layer-coated glass
substrates were preheated for 2 min in 120 °C, which is above
the glass transition temperature of PS colloids. Heating above the
glass transition temperature led to necking between the adjacent particles
and restricted the dislodging of colloids during solution growth of
ZnO nanorods. Following ZnO nanorod growth, the PS spheres were removed
by washing in the 1-chloropentane solvent followed by annealing at
200 °C (step 3, Scheme 1).

4.4 Decorating Au Nanoparticles
on Ordered ZnO
Nanorod Arrays
Au nanoparticles were decorated at room temperature
on the white light-activated best performing Z225 sensor
using thermal evaporation followed by solid-state dewetting of the
as-deposited film under high-temperature annealing (step 4, Scheme 1). In detail, 3 mg
Au was resistively evaporated from a tungsten boat at a base pressure
of 4 × 10–6 Torr for 3 min on unannealed ZnO
nanorods/ITO substrates. Au thin film-deposited samples were placed
in a quartz tube and annealed in a preheated oven at a predetermined
temperature of 400 °C till 30 min and cooled down to room temperature
for another 30 min of time.

4.5 Characterization
The morphology of
ordered ZnO nanorods and control (nanorods without template) samples
were investigated using FESEM (JSM7610F, JEOL, Japan). UV–visible
spectroscopy was carried out with deuterium- and halogen-combined
excitation source with the spectra being recorded using an AvaSpec-3648
spectrometer. PL measurements at room temperature were performed using
a He–Cd laser with a wavelength of 325 nm as the excitation
source having an output power of 45 mW and a TRIAX 320 monochromator
fitted with a cooled Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier detector. ImageJ
(version 1.50 e) was used to statistically analyze the data. The current–voltage
(I–V) and photoresponse characteristics
of the heterojunction devices were studied at room temperature using
a Keithley semiconductor parameter analyzer (4200 SCS), along with
a He–Cd laser (325 nm, 30 mW) and a broadband solar simulator
(AM 1.5, 100 mW/cm2) for UV and visible range illumination,
respectively.

4.6 Fabricating Gas Sensors
and Optoelectronic
Device
The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics and gas sensor
response were measured using a lateral photoconductor device configuration
for investigating the potentiality of these sensors under dark and
illumination conditions.

4.6.1 Gas Sensing Measurement
Setup
Gas
sensing properties of the samples were measured using a custom-made
gas sensor setup with a sealed and transparent quartz window stainless
steel closed container as a chamber (Figure S1 of the online Supporting Information). The device was kept
inside the chamber with the probes connected to the devices from ITO
as electrical contacts. The in situ heater inside the chamber was
used for high-temperature sensing measurements. The light-induced
sensing properties were measured using a white light of power 400
μW/cm2. Digital mass flow controllers from Alicat
were used to control the flow rates of test and carrier gases at an
appropriate proportion. The resistance of devices was measured using
an Agilent 349721 LXI data acquisition (DAQ) unit fitted with 34901A
20 channel multiplexer switches and a digital ohm meter. BenchLink
Data Logger Pro software was used for sensor response data acquisition.
