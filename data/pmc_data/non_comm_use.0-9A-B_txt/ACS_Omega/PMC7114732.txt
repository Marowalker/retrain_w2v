Pyrrole (Py) is easily agglomerated
during the polymerization process,
affecting its performance. In this paper, polypyrrole/monodispersed
latex sphere (PPy/MLS) composites were prepared using in-situ polymerization
for the adsorption of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)). The specific surface
area of PPy/MLS (39.30 m2/g) was increased relative to
that of PPy (24.82 m2/g), thus providing more effective
adsorption sites. In addition, the adsorption properties of Cr(VI)
under different conditions, including Py content, pH of the aqueous
solution, and PPy/MLS dosage, were investigated to reveal the adsorption
mechanism. The results showed that PPy/MLS possessed high Cr(VI) adsorption
capacities when the Py content was 50 wt %. The maximum adsorption
capacity was 343.64 mg/g at pH 2.0 and 25 °C. Remarkably, the
adsorbents exhibited an excellent removal rate of Cr(VI) after three
cycles of adsorption–desorption (over 99%), suggesting that
the adsorbents had exceptional recyclability. Furthermore, the adsorption
process followed quasi-second-order kinetics and Langmuir isothermal
adsorption model. The high adsorption performance, sustainability,
and cost-efficiency make this adsorbent a promising candidate for
large-scale Cr(VI) contaminant removal.

1 Introduction
Recently, the removal of pollutants from industrial wastewater
has attracted more and more attention with increasing awareness of
environmental protection.1−4 The methods of removing pollutants from wastewater
include ion exchange, electrochemical reduction, solvent extraction,
chemical precipitation, photodegradation adsorption, or membrane separation.5−8 In contrast, the adsorption method is favored by researchers and
has become one of the most promising technologies owing to its advantages
of being eco-friendly, recyclable, inexpensive, and operationally
simple as well as not generating waste water or secondary pollutants.9−12 Adsorbents play an important role in the process of adsorption.13−15 Among them, polypyrrole (PPy) is one of the most extensively studied
conducting polymers because of its nontoxicity, biocompatibility,
good electrical conductivity, moderate band gap, and reversible electrochemical
properties. Moreover, it has attracted a lot of interest because of
its potential applications in electrocatalysis, sensors, supercapacitors,
electronic devices, and adsorption fields.16,17 Recently, PPy adsorbents have attracted great attention in wastewater
treatment because of their easy synthesis, cost-efficiency, environmental
stability, excellent ion exchange, and redox properties.18,19 However, PPy is easy to agglomerate in water during synthesis because
of strong π–π interaction among the chains. In
addition, the doped anions (such as Cl– and NO3–) are difficult to diffuse out of the polymer.
Therefore, it is not easy to improve its adsorption efficiency.20,21 To overcome this shortcoming, preventing agglomeration and increasing
surface area of PPy are very important during synthesis and adsorption.
The PPy-based composites are considered to be one of the most effective
methods, which mainly include organic-PPy composites and inorganic-PPy
composites.22−27 In 2011, Chandra and co-workers28 reported
a PPy-reduced graphene oxide composite for the highly selective adsorption
of Hg2+. Moreover, Bhaumik et al.29 prepared the PPy/polyaniline nanofibers for the removal of Congo
red from aqueous solutions. Further, Aigbe et al.30 synthesized the PPy/Fe3O4 magnetic
nanocomposites for the removal of Cr(VI) in 2018. In these composites,
nanocomposites have larger surface area and more adsorption sites;
so they are more suitable for solving PPy aggregation.31−35 In addition, chromium (Cr) is widely used in metal smelting, leather
tanning, metal anticorrosion, textile dyestuffs, and other industrial
production processes.36 However, Cr pollution
has gained increasing attention due to air, water, soil pollution,
and concomitant negative health effects.37−40 Moreover, Cr(VI) is a highly
dangerous substance with strong mobility, high toxicity, and carcinogenic
and mutagenic properties.41−43 Therefore, the efficient removal
of Cr(VI) from water has become a global challenge and concern of
modern society.

This study aimed to prepare PPy-coated monodisperse
latex spheres
(MLS) with a large specific surface area, good dispersibility, and
controlled surface functional groups, using a simple preparation method
to provide effective adsorption sites for the adsorption of Cr(VI).
In addition, part of toxic Cr(VI) could be spontaneously reduced to
less toxic Cr(III) by PPy/MLS composites. The effects of the Py content
on the structure and morphology of the PPy/MLS composites were studied.
The removal rate and maximum adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) by PPy/MLS
were determined using adsorption kinetics, isotherms, thermodynamics,
and cyclic adsorption properties of Cr(VI). Furthermore, the preparation
process and adsorption mechanism of PPy/MLS for Cr(VI) were investigated.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of PPy/MLS
The Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of MLS, PPy, and PPy/MLS are presented
in Figure 1a. The main
characteristic peaks of MLS were at 2921 and 3025 cm–1 (C–H stretching vibrations of benzene), 2848 cm–1 (methylene adsorption bands), 1452 and 1493 cm–1 (benzene skeleton vibrations), and 1731 cm–1 (carbonyl
stretching). For PPy, the stretching peaks at 1544, 1296, and 1201
cm–1 were related to C=C, C–C, and
C–N, respectively. The peaks at 1460, 1400, 916, and 780 cm–1 were attributed to Py ring stretching.19,44,45 PPy/MLS had not only the main
characteristic peaks of MLS at 2921, 1452, and 2848 cm–1 but also the characteristic peaks of Py at 1296 and 780 cm–1.

Figure 1 FT-IR (a), TGA (b), DTG (c), and N2 adsorption–desorption
(d) spectra of MLS, PPy, and PPy/MLS.

Figure 1b,c shows
the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and DTG curves of MLS, PPy, and
PPy/MLS. The weight losses of MLS and PPy were 99.5 and 32 wt % at
800 °C, respectively. However, PPy/MLS had two stages of weight
loss. The mass loss of 66 wt % between 200 and 455 °C was caused
by the decomposition of MLS. At a temperature more than 455 °C,
the weight loss was mainly due to the decomposition of PPy. In addition,
the maximum decomposition temperature of PPy/MLS was 12.39 °C
higher than that of MLS because the molecular chains of PPy were entangled
on the surface of MLS, which improved the thermal stability of PPy/MLS.44,46 This result further confirmed that PPy and MLS were successfully
combined.

The specific surface area is a primary characteristic
of adsorbents. Figure 1d shows the N2 adsorption–desorption curves of
PPy, MLS, and PPy/MLS.
The specific surface area of PPy/MLS (39.30 m2/g) was increased
by 58.34% relative to that of PPy (24.82 m2/g). The large
specific surface area increased the number of adsorption sites for
Cr(VI) ions, improving the adsorption capacity of the composites.

In addition, the model diagram and scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs of MLS
and PPy/MLS composites are shown in Figure 2. The MLS possessed uniform particle size
(226 ± 9 nm), excellent monodispersity and an obvious core–shell
structure with a smooth surface, excellent homogeneity, and complete
sphericity. The PPy/MLS also possessed outstanding sphericity with
an average particle size of 255 ± 6 nm and poor monodispersity.47 TEM micrographs showed that the outer surface
of PPy/MLS became rough due to bonding and agglomeration.48 Elemental mapping graphs (Figure 2e–i) illustrated the presence of carbon,
oxygen, and nitrogen in PPy/MLS, indicating that PPy was wrapped on
the surface of the MLS, which was consistent with the results of FT-IR,
TGA, and N2 adsorption–desorption analyses.

2.2 Adsorption Behaviors
2.2.1 Effect of the Py Concentration
The content of the Py
monomer had a substantial influence on the
adsorption process (see the details in Text S1). Figure 3 shows
the SEM images and adsorption properties of PPy/MLS for Cr(VI) with
different concentrations in the Py monomer. The adsorption capacity
of Cr(VI) increased with the increase in Py concentration and reached
the maximum (364.19 mg/g) at 50 wt %. However, the adsorption capacity
decreased gradually when the Py concentration further increased. These
results indicated that the amount of PPy and active adsorption sites
on the surface of MLS increased with the increase in the Py monomer
content, thus enhancing the adsorption capacity of Cr(VI). In fact,
MLS were introduced to increase the dispersion of PPy. In Figure 3a, PPy began to agglomerate
when Py concentration was more than 50 wt %. Therefore, PPy/MLS prepared
with 50 wt % Py was used in the adsorption experiments.

(a) and adsorption properties (b) of PPy/MLS with
different Py concentrations for Cr(VI).

2.2.2 Effect of pH
As shown in Figure 4a, the zero-charge
point (pHzcp) of PPy/MLS was at pH 4.6. The nitrogen atoms
of PPy were protonated in the presence of H+ at lower pH
(lower than pHzcp), which made the surface of PPy/MLS positively
charged. This allowed the surface to interact with HCrO4– by electrostatic attraction, thereby improving
the ion exchange performance of the composites. The zeta potentials
of MLS were all less than −30 mV at the tested pH, proving
that MLS was highly stable in solution.49

performance of PPy, MLS, and PPy/MLS for Cr(VI) at different pH; (c)
adsorption properties for Cr(VI) with different Py concentrations;
and (d) effect of coexisting ions on Cr(VI) adsorption by PPy/MLS.

The ionic forms of Cr(VI) were different at different
pH. The predominant
species were H2CrO4 (pH was less than 1), HCrO4–, Cr2O72– (at pH 2–6), Cr2O72–, CrO42– (at pH 6–8), and CrO42– (more than pH 8).49,50Figure 4b shows the
effect of pH on the removal efficiency for Cr(VI) by PPy, MLS, and
PPy/MLS (details in Text S2). The removal
rate of three adsorbents decreased gradually with increasing pH. The
removal efficiency reached 98.13% with PPy/MLS at pH 2.0, whereas
those of PPy and MLS were only 24.85 and 17.30%, respectively. These
results were due to the larger specific surface area and greater number
of adsorption active sites on the composites after the polymerization
of Py on the surface of MLS. The decrease in the removal efficiency
was attributed to the competition between hydroxyl (OH–) and CrO42– with increasing pH (higher
than pHzcp), which competed for the same adsorption sites
on the adsorbent surface.51 Therefore,
pH 2.0 was ideal for the removal of Cr(VI) by PPy/MLS.

2.2.3 Effect of Adsorbent Dosage
The
effects of the adsorbent dosage on the removal rate (%) and adsorption
capacity of Cr(VI) from aqueous solutions are shown in Figure 4c (details in Text S3). The removal rate improved from 38.8 to 100% with
increasing adsorbent dosage. This could be attributed to the greater
number of adsorption active sites.52 When
the dosage was greater than 80 mg, the Cr(VI) was completely removed.
These results further confirmed that PPy/MLS exhibited excellent adsorption
efficiency for Cr(VI).

2.2.4 Effect Coexisting Ions
Industrial
wastewater contains not only Cr(VI) but also other ions. Therefore,
studying the adsorption properties of PPy/MLS for Cr(VI) in the presence
of other ions is important. Figure 4d shows the effects of the binary adsorption systems
on the adsorption of Cr(VI). The initial concentration of all ions
and the dose of adsorbent were 100 mg/L and 20.0 mg, respectively.
The removal rate of Cr(VI) by PPy/MLS did not change significantly
in the presence of Cl–, NO3–, SO42–, Zn2+, Fe3+, Sn4+, and Cu2+, indicating no competitive
relationship between the coexisting ions and HCrO4– on the surface of the adsorbent.50,53,54 The reason was that the PPy/MLS was positively
charged at pH 2.0. In the binary system of cations (Zn2+, Fe3+, Sn4+, and Cu2+), the adsorption
centers with positive charge were repulsive to cations, and the main
existence form of Cr(VI) was HCrO4– at
pH 2.0; so the cations were not competitive for the adsorption of
Cr(VI). For the binary system of anions (Cl–, NO3–, SO42–),
it is well known that the interaction of Cl– and
NO3– with adsorption sites of the adsorbent
was weak than HCrO4–. The hydration energy
of SO42– was higher than that of HCrO4–; so SO42– was not easy to bind to the adsorption sites. On the other hand,
PPy/MLS can reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III), so that Cr(VI) was adsorbed
until equilibrium.55,56

2.3 Adsorption
Kinetics, Isotherms, Thermodynamic
Investigations, and Regeneration Analyses
2.3.1 Adsorption
Kinetics
The adsorption
kinetics are mainly concerned with the time at which the adsorbents
reach adsorption equilibrium in the adsorption process. The effect
of the adsorption time on the adsorption of Cr(VI) at three different
initial concentrations of Cr(VI) is shown in Figure 5a. The adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) increased
with increasing adsorption time before reaching adsorption equilibrium.
The adsorption rate was fast at the beginning of the adsorption process.
However, it gradually slowed due to the decreased number of active
sites available on the adsorbent as the reaction approached equilibrium.
When the initial concentrations of Cr(VI) were 25, 50, and 75 mg/L,
the adsorption capacities of PPy/MLS for Cr(VI) were 172.41, 323.62,
and 371.75 mg/g, respectively, indicating that the concentration gradient
was a driving factor in the adsorption process.56,57

Figure 5 (a)
Effects of the adsorption time on the adsorption capacity for
Cr(VI) with different initial concentrations of solution; (b) quasi-first
order kinetic model; (c) quasi-second-order kinetic model, and (d)
intraparticle diffusion model.

The pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and intraparticle
diffusion models were applied to better understand the adsorption
process (details in Text S4). The fitting
results are shown in Figure 5 and Table 1; the correlation coefficient (R2) of
the pseudo-second-order kinetic model was larger than that of the
pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The experimental capacity was in
agreement with the calculated values of pseudo-second-order kinetic
model, indicating that the adsorption process of PPy/MLS for Cr(VI)
followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. Furthermore, in the intraparticle
diffusion model, the adsorption process of Cr(VI) by PPy/MLS was divided
into two parts. The initial rapid removal rate might be achieved by
the influence of boundary layer diffusion, and the slow removal rate
was due to intraparticle pore diffusion.21,29

2.3.2 Adsorption
Isotherms
The adsorption
isotherms at different temperatures are shown in Figure 6. The adsorption capacity increased
rapidly and then attained equilibrium with increasing concentration.
The adsorption capacities at 25, 35, and 45 °C were 348.67, 387.99,
and 428.56 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption data were fitted using
the Freundlich and Langmuir models (see the details in Text S5). The fitting results are shown in Figure 6b,c and Table 2. The results showed
that the R2 of the Langmuir isotherm model
was greater than 0.99 at different temperatures, indicating that the
Cr(VI) adsorption process was better fitted by the Langmuir adsorption
model. In addition, the maximum adsorption capacities (Qmax) were 343.64, 389.11, and 429.18 mg/g at 25, 35, and
45 °C, which were higher than those of most other reported adsorbents
at 25 °C (Table 3). The value of RL was between 0 and 1, confirming that
the adsorption process using PPy/MLS was advantageous. In addition,
the 1/n parameter of the Freundlich model was also
between 0.1 and 0.5, suggesting that the adsorption was easy.50,56

2.3.3 Thermodynamic Investigations
The
thermodynamic parameters, such as the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG0), enthalpy change (ΔH0), and entropy change (ΔS0), are shown in Figure 6d and Table 4 (see the details in Text S6). The values
of ΔH0 and ΔS0 were 17.50 kJ·mol–1 and 0.062
kJ·mol–1 K–1, respectively.
The positive value of ΔH0 indicated
that the adsorption process was endothermic, and the positive value
of ΔS0 suggested the randomness
in the solid/liquid interface system increased during the adsorption
process. However, the negative values of ΔG0 at all temperatures illustrated the feasibility and
spontaneity of the adsorption process.21,56

2.3.4 Regeneration Analyses
The cyclic
adsorption performance of adsorbents is key to their potential applicability
in wastewater treatment. Figure 7 shows the removal efficiency of Cr(VI) by PPy/MLS
over five adsorption–desorption cycles (details in Text S7). The removal rate remained the same
(100%) in the first three cycles and gradually decreased in the fourth
(86.47%) and fifth cycles (76.37%). The decrease in adsorption capacity
might be because of the breakage of the polymer chains due to the
repeated oxidation reactions with highly oxidized Cr(VI), which would
reduce the effective adsorption mass and number of active sites on
the adsorbents.20,29,53

Figure 7 Removal
efficiency of PPy/MLS nanohybrids over five cycles of adsorption.

2.4 Adsorption Mechanism
To verify the
ion exchange mechanism of PPy/MLS on Cr(VI) and PPy/MLS before and
after adsorption were characterized by energy dispersive spectrometry
(EDS). In Figure 8,
two new characteristic peaks appeared at 5.4 and 5.9 keV after adsorption.
In addition, the adsorption intensity of Cl decreased and that of
O increased. According to elemental mapping, the Cr was dispersed
on the surface of the composite. These results showed that Cr was
successfully adsorbed on the surface of PPy/MLS based on to the exchange
of the chloride ions (Cl–) of PPy/MLS for Cr.50,53,54

Figure 8 EDS spectra (A) of PPy/MLS before and
after adsorption and the
elemental mapping graphs (B) of the overall content (a,b), carbon
(c), oxygen (d), nitrogen (e), and chromium (f).

The adsorption mechanism of Cr(VI) on PPy/MLS was further verified,
using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to investigate the elemental
composition and content before and after adsorption. Figure 9a shows that the characteristic
peak of Cr appeared after adsorption, and the peak intensity of Cl
in PPy/MLS decreased significantly, while that of O increased. This
phenomenon was due to the ion exchange reaction between Cl– and HCrO4– in the adsorption process
of Cr(VI) by PPy/MLS, resulting in the obvious enhancement of the
characteristic peaks of Cr and O in PPy/MLS after adsorption. In the
Cr 2p spectra (Figure 9b), the adsorption peaks of Cr appeared with binding energies of
576.7, 578.1, 586.3, and 588.1 eV, which corresponded to the characteristic
peaks of Cr(III) and Cr(VI). The appearance of Cr(III) indicated that
PPy/MLS possessed strong reducing ability and converted Cr(VI) into
Cr(III).49,52,57

spectra (a) before and after adsorption of Cr(VI) and
binding energies of Cr 2p (b) after the adsorption of Cr(VI) by PPy/MLS.

Based on the aforementioned analysis, the preparation
of PPy/MLS
and adsorption mechanism for Cr(VI) are shown in Figure 10. First, the surface of MLS
contained a large number of carboxyl groups with negative charges
under acidic conditions, and the N+ sites were positively
charged in the Py monomers. Py monomers were enriched on the surface
of MLS via electrostatic interactions. After that, the Py monomers
were oxidized and polymerized on the surface of MLS through intermolecular
hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions to afford the PPy/MLS
composites after adding FeCl3, as the N+ and
Cl– ions were attracted by electrostatic interactions.
When K2Cr2O7 was added to the system
at low pH, the HCrO4– ions exchanged
with Cl– and associated with N+ through
electrostatic interactions, thereby achieving the adsorption of Cr(VI).
In the desorption process, OH– ions exchanged with
HCrO4– after adding NaOH solution and
were associated with N+ by electrostatic interactions,
achieving the desorption of Cr(VI).41,50,55

adsorption–desorption
mechanism for Cr(VI).

3 Conclusions
The MLS and PPy/MLS were prepared by emulsion polymerization and
in-situ polymerization, respectively. The FT-IR, TGA, SEM, and TEM
analyses confirmed that PPy was uniformly coated on the surface of
MLS, which solved the agglomeration of PPy and increased the adsorption
sites. The adsorption properties of PPy/MLS for Cr(VI) were studied
under different conditions. The adsorption capacity was best at pH
2.0 with a Py content of 50 wt %. The adsorption process followed
quasi-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isothermal adsorption models.
The maximum adsorption capacity was 343.64 mg/g at 298 K. The removal
rate of Cr(VI) remained constant over three adsorption–desorption
cycles. PPy/MLS showed selective adsorption. In addition, the removal
mechanism of Cr(VI) was confirmed by EDS and XPS. The dispersion of
PPy was successfully improved by MLS, and the adsorption performance
for Cr(VI) was increased. Therefore, the PPy/MLS composite is a promising
adsorbent for Cr(VI).

4 Experimental Procedure
4.1 Materials
Styrene (St), methyl methacrylate
(MMA), acrylic acid (AA), sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS),
ammonium persulfate (APS), ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3), pyrrole (Py), ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O), potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7), alkaline aluminum oxide, sodium chloride (NaCl),
sodium nitrate (NaNO3), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), zinc chloride (ZnCl2), stannic chloride (SnCl4), copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), phosphoric acid (H3PO4), diphenyl carbamide
(C13H14N4O), acetone (C3H6O), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH)
were purchased from Aladdin (China, Shanghai). All chemicals were
of analytical grade. Styrene (St) was purified by passing through
an alkaline aluminum oxide column, and all other chemicals were used
without further purification.

4.2 Preparation
of PPy/MLS Composites
PPy/MLS were prepared by an in situ
oxidative polymerization (Figure 11). First, the MLS
of poly(St-MMA–AA) were prepared by an emulsion polymerization
using a traditional approach.47 Briefly,
NH4HCO3 (0.498 g) and SDBS (0.003 g) in 100
mL of water were transferred to a 250 mL three-necked round-bottomed
flask equipped with a water segregator, dropping funnel, and a magnetic
stirrer. Then, St (19.018 g), AA (1.001 g), and MMA (1.001 g) were
added. The reaction was carried out at 70 °C for 0.5 h with continuous
agitation. Then, an aqueous solution of APS (0.484 g) was added dropwise,
and the polymerization was carried out at 80 °C for 10 h with
continuous stirring. The obtained latex spheres were used directly
without purification. The sample was denoted as MLS.

Figure 11 Schematic of the preparation
process and adsorption effect of PPy/MLS.

In a typical procedure, PPy/MLS were prepared by an in situ oxidative
polymerization. In detail, the MLS were dispersed in an aqueous solution
of Py with different concentrations (10 wt % ≈ 90 wt %) for
10 min by ultrasonic dispersion. The polymerization was carried out
at 25 °C for 12 h by slowly adding a solution of FeCl3·6H2O in HCl (0.5 mol/L) as the oxidant. During the
oxidative polymerization of Py, the MLS turned from white to gray
and finally turned black within a few minutes, which confirmed that
the MLS were filled with PPy. After polymerization, the PPy/MLS composite
was washed with distilled water several times to remove the byproducts
and residues of the reaction. Finally, the product was dried in a
vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h. The Py/FeCl3·6H2O molar ratio used in the chemical synthesis was 1:2.3. The
sample was denoted PPy/MLS.

The preparation method of pure PPy
is as follows: pyrrole monomer
(0.6 g) was dispersed in the aqueous solution for 10 min by ultrasonic
dispersion. Then, the mixture was carried out at 25 °C for 12
h by slowly adding a solution of FeCl3·6H2O (5.556 g) in HCl (100 mL, 0.5 mol/L). The solid was washed with
distilled water 3 times. Finally, the product was dried in a vacuum
oven at 80 °C for 12 h to obtain the pure PPy powder.

4.3 Adsorption Capacity
Cr(VI) solutions
were prepared by dissolving K2Cr2O7 in deionized water. A solution with a Cr(VI) concentration of 1000
mg/L was prepared by dissolving 2.8287 g of K2Cr2O7 in 1000 mL of water. Adsorption experiments were carried
out by diluting the original solution to different concentrations.
The pH of each solution (from 2 to 10) was adjusted using a SX-610
pH meter (Sanxin, China) by adding HCl or NaOH.

A series of
adsorption experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of
Py concentration, pH, and reaction time on the adsorption capacity.
The PPy/MLS composites were added into the Cr(VI) solutions. Then,
the above mixtures were placed in a thermostatic shaker (Tianjin Saidriss
Experimental Analytical Instrument Factory SHA-B, China) at ambient
temperature (25 °C) for 24 h at 200 rpm. Finally, the solution
was filtered through 0.22 mm filter paper (micropore, 47 mm in diameter).
The analyses of Cr(VI) in the aqueous solutions were performed using
a UV–vis spectrophotometer at 540 nm after complexation with
1,5-diphenylcarbazide.

4.4 Characterization
FT-IR spectra were
obtained using a Thermo Nexus 470 FT-IR instrument by grinding and
tableting the sample with KBr. The microphotographs of the materials
were observed through field emission SEM (S-4800) and TEM (JEM-2100F).
TGA was performed using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TA Q500) under
N2 with a temperature ramp rate of 10 °C/min from
20 to 800 °C. The zeta potential and particle size of the samples
were measured by a Zetasizer instrument (3000HS, Malvern Ltd., UK).
X-ray diffraction analysis was performed using small-angle X-ray scattering
(X’Pert Pro) with a scanning range of 5–80°, a
speed of 3°/min, and Kα(Cu) radiation. The specific surface
area, pore volume, and pore size of the samples were determined using
an automatic physical adsorption instrument (Tristar3000, Micromeritics
Ltd., UK). EDS, and the sample concentrations were assessed by electron
microscopy (SEM, S-4800) and dual-beam ultraviolet–visible
spectrophotometry (TU-1901), respectively. The elements in the materials
were analyzed by XPS (ESCALAB 250Xi).
