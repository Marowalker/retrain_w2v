Recent advances have
demonstrated the ability to 3D-print, via
extrusion, solvent-based liquid materials (previously named 3D-Paints)
which solidify nearly instantaneously upon deposition and contain
a majority by volume of solid particulate material. In prior work,
the dissolved polymer binder which enables this process is a high
molecular weight biocompatible elastomer, poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA). We demonstrate in this study an expansion
of this solvent-based 3D-Paint system to two additional, less-expensive,
and less-specialized polymers, polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene oxide
(PEO). The polymer binder used within the 3D-Paint was shown to significantly
affect the as-printed and thermal postprocessing behavior of printed
structures. This development enables users to select one of several
polymers to impart the most desirable properties for a given application.
Additionally, 3D-Paints based on these new binders are not adversely
affected by classes of particles that can chemically degrade PLGA,
notably particles containing large quantities of alkali ions. This
study demonstrates the ability to successfully use PS and PEO as binders
in the 3D-Paint system and compares the rheological, mechanical, microstructural,
and thermal properties of the modified 3D-Paints and resulting as-printed
and thermally post-processed objects. These objects include, for the
first time, structures resulting from 3D-Painting which mostly contain
soda-lime glass and 45S5 bioactive glass.

Introduction
The term additive manufacturing
is used to describe a broad class
of processes which involve the building of a part from a 3D model
in an additive manner, often in a layer-by-layer process. Among the
numerous advantages of additive manufacturing techniques is the ability
to fabricate user-defined parts, including those with complex internal
architecture or porosity, without the need for tooling, masks, or
dies and with little material waste. The subclass of additive manufacturing
processes which involve the deposition of feedstock materials through
a nozzle or printhead are collectively termed 3D-printing,1 which includes (but is not limited to) direct
ink writing, fused-deposition modelling, 3D-inkjet printing, and numerous
others. The details of printing methods, compatible materials, and
applications have been thoroughly reviewed elsewhere.2,3 Collectively, these techniques have been used to additively manufacture
many different materials, including metals and alloys,4−7 ceramics8−10 and glasses,11−16 thermoplastics,17−19 and hydrogels and biomaterials.20−22

However,
a single technique has been seldom used to additively
manufacture hundreds of separate materials across many material classes.
Recent progress by Shah, et al. has focused on developing a material-agnostic
approach to 3D-printing which extrudes filaments of material containing
a majority of embedded, functional particles within a polymeric matrix.
This technique, named 3D-Painting, which has so far been used to successfully
3D-print metals and metal oxides,23−27 bioceramics,28 biologically-derived
materials,29 2D nanomaterials,30,31 planetary regoliths,32,33 water-soluble salts,23,34 and mixed material systems,35 is capable
of processing such a broad range of particulate materials because
of the purely physical interaction between the particles, polymer,
and solvents. The interaction between the components is physical,
in that particles are simply embedded in a matrix of polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) which precipitates out of dichloromethane
(DCM) solution upon extrusion because of the volatility of the DCM
under atmospheric conditions. Although the ability to 3D-print a wide
range of particulate materials using only the PLGA binder has historically
been viewed as advantageous in its simplicity, there remain limitations
to the use of a PLGA binder. For instance, PLGA is not chemically
stable in the presence of all particles, especially those containing
significant amounts of alkali elements/ions such as Li and Na; previous
work has thoroughly established the fact that PLGA (as well as other
polymers in the α-hydroxyester family) is degraded by alkali
hydrolysis.36−43 This chemical instability precludes the use of the 3D-Painting technique
with high-alkali glasses, such as soda lime glass and bioactive glasses.
The usefulness of glasses in the fields of optics,44,45 fluidics,46 and medicine47 is well demonstrated. While additively manufactured inorganic
and bioactive glasses have been demonstrated previously,11−16 these efforts have primarily relied on stereolithographic techniques
which depend on the interaction of light with a photocurable polymer
to maintain shape.11−13 Other previously demonstrated processes require the
use of high-temperature 3D-printing equipment16 or rely on the extrusion of slurries which require extended (>24
h) post-print drying times.14,15 3D-Painting offers
a relatively facile, highly scalable, room-temperature methodology
to 3D-print materials requiring no drying time after printing and
containing a majority by volume of the functional material in the
resulting printed structure.

For these reasons, the 3D-Painting
system must be expanded to enable
the use of binding polymers other than PLGA and more generally to
those outside of the polyester family, which possess a high level
of stability in the presence of alkali cations, to enable the processing
of materials such as high-alkali glasses. Alternative binding polymers
also enhance the versatility of the 3D-Painting system, by potentially
imparting a different combination of properties than those imparted
by PLGA, even for systems containing particles that do not affect
the stability of PLGA. To this end, we present two alternatives to
PLGA in the form of polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene oxide (PEO).
While both PS and PEO have been used in 3D-printing applications in
the past,48,49 neither of the polymers has been previously
utilized as a binder for the 3D-Painting system. Newly developed 3D-Paints
(also more generally referred to as “3D-inks” or simply
“inks”) in this work are based on the well-established
PLGA formulation but incorporate not only a different polymer binder
(PS or PEO) but also different quantities of ethylene glycol butyl
ether (EGBE) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP), low-volatility solvents
which ensure both extrudability of these new inks and that the printed
filaments will be self-supporting. 3D-Paints based on these new polymers
are not only 3D-printable but are also capable of incorporating 45S5
bioactive glass and soda-lime glass. Because properties of composites
containing particles are significantly influenced by the interaction
between the particles and the matrix, as well as the properties of
the surrounding matrix,32,35 it is not surprising
that a substitution of PLGA for PS or PEO leads to a marked change
in properties of both the 3D-Paints and the 3D-printed materials.
This study characterizes and compares the rheological properties of
the liquid 3D-Paints, the microstructural, mechanical, and thermal
properties of 3D-printed materials, and briefly, the microstructure
of debound and sintered 3D-printed objects using a range of both previously
demonstrated particles and newly demonstrated alkali-containing glasses.

Results
and Discussion
Ink Synthesis, Rheological Property Characterization,
and 3D-Printing
A total of nine 3D-Paints were prepared for
this study, seven of
which were ultimately 3D-printed. 3D-Paints are prepared by dissolving
the polymer in DCM and then adding the mixture of particles, EGBE,
DBP, and excess DCM, to the dissolved polymer solution. These inks
are formulated so that each 3D-printed material is 70% particles by
volume (i.e., 30 vol % polymer) and included 45S5, SLG, and Fe metal
particles with a PS binder, referred henceforth as 45S5:PS, SLG:PS,
and Fe:PS, respectively, as well as (designated in the same way) 45S5:PEO,
SLG:PEO, and Fe:PEO, and 45S5:PLGA, SLG:PLGA, and Fe:PLGA for particle
inks made with PEO and PLGA binders, respectively. For reasons described
above, the 45S5:PLGA and SLG:PLGA inks were not 3D-printable. The
Fe-containing inks were synthesized in order to enable a direct comparison
between the properties of 3D-printed objects containing PLGA, PS,
or PEO (because Fe particles have no adverse effect on PLGA and have
been demonstrated previously23,24). A schematic of the
synthesis and processing steps involved in ink preparation, 3D-printing,
and postprocessing/application are shown in Figure 1. Like the previously demonstrated PLGA-based
materials, PEO and PS-based materials can either be used immediately
or stored in air-tight, glass containers at approximately 4 °C
until use. The combined pre-ink is allowed to thicken by DCM evaporation
at ambient conditions, or under gentle sonication and gentle heating
(which accelerates the process), until the inks reach the appropriate
viscosity for 3D-printing. The 3D-printable viscosity for PLGA-based
inks prepared in this manner has been previously reported to fall
within the range of 30–35 Pa·s23,32,34 (rheological measurements performed for
this study reveal the “appropriate viscosity” for the
PS-based inks to fall within a range of 1–5 Pa·s (see Figure 2) but do not directly
identify viscosity for PEO-based inks).

Figure 1 Polymers (PLGA, PS, or
PEO) are dissolved in excess DCM while particles
are separately mixed with EGBE, DBP, and excess DCM. Once polymer
dissolution is complete, the two components are combined and homogenized.
The 3D-Paints are thickened via evaporation of DCM to appropriate
printing viscosity and then extruded layer-by-layer. The resulting
3D-printed objects can be handled and used as printed, or undergo
additional processing, such as pyrolysis and sintering, depending
on the particle content and end application.

Figure 2 Viscosity curves obtained from rotational tests (A,B) and storage
and loss moduli curves obtained from oscillatory measurements (C–E).
Viscosity of (degraded) 45S5:PLGA and SLG:PLGA was such that stresses
higher than several Pa could not be generated by the instrument (A).
All materials tested as ready-to-print; in this state, PEO materials
could not be correctly tested in rotation without sample slipping.

All inks were thickened to their
appropriate 3D-printing viscosity
and the flow properties measured with a rheometer using both rotational
shear and frequency sweep measurements (Figure 2). Differences in the flow behavior are apparent
to the naked eye; PS-based inks possess a lower viscosity than (nondegraded)
PLGA-based inks, while PEO-based inks have a dramatically higher viscosity
(Video S1). In fact, the large viscosity
of printable PEO-based inks, which better resembles a modeling putty
or clay than the liquid-like PLGA- and PS-based inks, meant that they
could not be successfully tested in rotation on the rheometer without
sample slipping, thus violating the criterion for laminar flow in
the material. Therefore, a 3D-printing viscosity for the PEO-based
inks is not reported. In substitution of the rotational tests, frequency
sweeps were conducted on the as-printable PEO materials (and also
conducted on PLGA and PS-containing inks, for completeness). Additionally,
in order to elucidate the effect of the presence of particles on 3D-printable
materials, entirely polymeric inks were prepared (PLGA, PS, PEO dissolved
in DCM and with added EGBE, DBP, but without particles) and measured.
In order to mitigate the effects of drying (via DCM evaporation) during
the measurements, a solvent trap was used. PLGA and Fe:PLGA materials
exhibit shear-thinning behavior as expected, with Fe:PLGA possessing
low-shear viscosity similar to the previously reported ideal range
of 30–35 Pa·s (Figure 2A). SLG:PLGA and 45S5:PLGA, on the other hand, possess
substantially lower low-shear viscosities, presumably because of the
previously investigated degradation of the PLGA polymer in the presence
of alkali ions,36−43 such as those present in SLG and 45S5. In fact, the viscosities
are so low in these inks that the rheometer was unable to generate
shear stress in the material across the entire test range, hence the
apparently truncated curves in Figure 2A. Low shear viscosities of the as-printable PS-based
inks are lower that than for PLGA and fall within a range of 1–5
Pa·s. The frequency sweeps (Figure 2C–E) generally reveal that the storage
modulus (G′) of the inks is larger than loss
modulus (G″), indicating dominant solid-like
behavior, although it must be noted that conducting the measurement
at all requires exposing the materials to air, albeit briefly and
despite the use of the solvent trap, such that there may be some solidification
that occurs as a result. More interesting is that in the case of PEO-based
materials, G′ exceeds G″
at larger angular frequencies by nearly an order of magnitude, whereas
the difference is significantly smaller in the same range for the
PS- and PLGA-based inks. This result correlates with the qualitative,
visual observation that the PEO-based materials are more “putty-like”,
and the PLGA and PS-based materials possess a more-obvious liquid
character. Otherwise, the results of the frequency sweeps are consistent
with the data obtained from the rotational tests. The viscosity of
the inks containing 45S5 and SLG is always higher than for those containing
Fe (barring the case of PLGA, again because of polymer degradation).
This effect is likely a result of the different particle size regime
of the Fe (with a range of approximately 1–3 μm) versus
SLG and 45S5 which are approximately 44 μm (corresponding to
a 325 mesh)50 as seen in Figure 3.

Figure 3 SEM micrographs of 3D-printed
strut cross-sections of 3D-printed
materials, except 45S5:PLGA and SLG:PLGA (A,B) which could not be
printed. In these two cases, degraded ink was allowed to dry and subsequently
imaged. Micrographs capture different morphologies and sizes of 45S5,
SLG, and Fe particles (note different scale bar for Fe-containing
samples). Unlike for 45S5:PLGA and SLG:PLGA, in the Fe:PLGA ink, the
PLGA polymer is clearly visible coating the particles (C). PS and
PEO polymers are not noticeably different in morphology for inks containing
45S5 and SLG particles than for Fe (D–I).

For each ink, 3D-printing occurs via extrusion followed by
rapid
solidification of the material because of precipitation of the binding
polymer resulting from DCM vaporization. The results are 3D-printed
filaments which are self-supporting, maintain shape, and fuse to previously
printed layers because of residual solvent content (Videos S2–S4). Samples for
tensile and compression testing (“dogbones” and cylinders)
as well as fibers for thermal measurements and cylinders for thermal
processing and sintering were 3D-printed (Figure S1). All 3D-printing was performed on a single, commercial
3D-printing instrument, although print parameters (linear speed, extrusion
pressure, and so forth.) were tailored for each ink (Figure S2). See the Supporting Information for details on exact size and geometry of 3D-printed objects and
on 3D-printing process parameters.

Microstructure
The microstructure of the 3D-printed
objects was imaged using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Micrographs
showing cross-sections of 3D-printed struts are given in Figure 3. For the cases of
45S5:PLGA and SLG:PLGA inks, which could not be printed, degraded
ink was allowed to dry and was subsequently imaged (shown in Figure 3A,B). Images capture
different morphologies, sizes, and size distributions of 45S5, SLG,
and Fe particles, demonstrating that the method is sufficiently robust
to enable the 3D-printing of particles of various shapes and size
regimes. Notably, the binding polymer is not evident in the microstructure
of 45S5:PLGA and does not uniformly coat particles in SLG:PLGA, as
it does in the case of Fe:PLGA (Figure 3C), likely because of degradation via alkali hydrolysis
of PLGA by the alkali content in 45S5 and SLG. The PS- and PEO-based
materials, on the other hand, are not noticeably different in morphology
for inks containing 45S5 and SLG particles than for those containing
Fe (Figure 3D–I),
further supporting the hypothesis that these polymers are not chemically
affected by the alkali content of the glasses. Apparent texture in
the polymer in SLG:PEO (Figure 3H) and Fe:PEO (Figure 3I) is likely introduced by the sectioning processes prior
to imaging.

Tension and Compression Properties
The mechanical properties
of 3D-printed objects are influenced by the properties of the polymer
binder; therefore, the choice of the binder has a marked effect on
the properties of the 3D-printed objects. Samples printed from each
3D-printable ink were tested in both tension and compression. Representative
stress versus strain curves for tensile specimens 3D-printed from
each material are presented in Figure 4A. Compared to previously established PLGA-based materials,
PS-based materials are stronger and stiffer, whereas PEO-based materials
are generally more compliant and fail at much larger strains (Figure 4B,C). Thicker polymer
bridges between particles, like those observed under the SEM in the
case of PEO-based materials, enable much larger tensile strain-to-failure
observed in the PEO-based materials compared to PLGA and PS (although
the mechanical properties of the polymer itself are still a major
contributor). For both PS- and PEO-based materials, the Fe-containing
samples are stiffer and fail at lower strains than for the SLG- and
45S5-containing samples. This result is again likely attributable
to the smaller particle size distribution of the Fe particles, which
leads to smaller polymer bridges between particles (because volume
fraction is the same in all cases), which strain harden more quickly
and lead to failure at lower strains.

3D-printed tensile specimens (note the break in the abscissa). (B)

vs strain curves and averaged over each sample. (C) Average strain
to failure for each 3D-printed material.

The mechanical properties in compression are highly dependent
on
the 3D-printed geometry because the cylinders are not fully dense
but rather have regular, macroscopic 3D-printed architecture (Figure S1).24 Representative
compressive load versus strain curves are presented in Figure S3A. The PLGA- and PEO-based cylinders
appear to compress uniformly and densify with increasing strain, while
the PS-based cylinders tend to fail catastrophically and then pulverize
in sections (Figure S3B, Video S5). The PLGA-based cylinders are elastic until approximately
5% strain and reach a compressive load of nearly 200 N, at which point
the load (and therefore engineering stress) plateaus as the cylinder
densifies until reaching approximately 42% strain. Beyond this point,
the load required to continue compression increases at an accelerating
rate. PEO-based cylinders exhibit a qualitatively similar behavior
to PLGA-based cylinders, but instead strain under smaller loads plateauing
between 50 and 75 N before beginning a sharp increase. PS-based cylinders
are brittle and fail catastrophically in sections; after the failure
of a particular section of the cylinders, the load naturally drops
until the test apparatus encounters an intact section of the cylinder,
at which point the load rises again until catastrophic failure of
the underlying section. This process repeats until the entire cylinder
is pulverized, usually after the failure of 3–4 separate sections.
In both cases of PS and PEO, 45S5-containing cylinders begin to yield
at lower loading than Fe or SLG-containing counterparts. This observation
is a likely result of the different particle geometry; the 45S5 particles
are highly angular and introduce stress concentrations into the polymer
binders which lead to yield at lower loadings. For the spherical and
relatively monodisperse Fe and SLG particles, stress throughout the
loaded binder is more homogeneous, therefore yielding occurs at higher
loading. In general, given these observations, PS would prove itself
useful in an application where strength and rigidity, rather than
ductility, are valued properties, whereas PEO would better serve in
an application requiring large plasticity without failure.

Thermal
Property Characterization
The rheological measurements
and examination of the microstructure under SEM both support the idea
of PLGA degradation by 45S5 and SLG. In order to empirically confirm
the degradation of PLGA, as well as the stability of PS and PEO in
the presence of 45S5 and SLG, fibers of each 3D-printed material were
prepared for both thermogravimetry (TGA) and differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC). In the cases of 45S5:PLGA and SLG:PLGA, samples
of the ink were taken and allowed to dry overnight in ambient air
before testing. For points of comparison, the as-received polymers
and polymers dissolved in DCM and reprecipitated via solvent evaporation
were also tested. As-received PLGA experiences glass transition at
approximately 65 °C and melting at approximately 166 °C,
as similarly reported in previous studies on the properties of PLA
dissolved in DCM and reprecipitated51 (Figure 5A). Thermal decomposition
of PLGA begins at approximately 275 °C with an endothermic peak
at approximately 370 °C (Figure 5D), with complete decomposition by 400 °C (Figure 5A). A standard enthalpy
of fusion (ΔHm*) between 93.0 and 93.6 J/g has historically
been used for PLGA polymers possessing a majority of lactide monomers,51−53 based on the melting enthalpy of polylactic acid (PLA). Standard
enthalpies of 93.0 and 197 J/g54 are used
for estimations of PLGA and PEO crystallinity, respectively, according
to eq 1, after the endotherms
have been properly scaled to the mass of the polymer in the sample. 1  

Figure 5 Thermogravimetric (A–C) and calorimetric
(D–F) measurements
on as-received polymer (orange), polymer dissolved in DCM and re-precipitated
(green) and Fe- (gray), SLG- (red), and 45S5- (blue) containing 3D-printed
fibers (all normalized to the mass of the overall sample). Because
particle-containing inks were prepared as 70 vol % particles, weight
fraction of pyrolizable material varies with particle density. (A)
45S5:PLGA and SLG:PLGA exhibit significant mass loss associated with
PLGA-constituents prior to PLGA pyrolysis in Fe:PLGA or in as-received
and re-precipitated PLGA. This difference is not observed in PS- and
PEO-containing fibers (B,C).

Crystallinity of the polymer for various samples is displayed
in Figure S4. In general, dissolving the
polymer
in DCM and reprecipitating or 3D-printing leads to lower crystallinities
compared to the as-received polymer. Similar levels of crystallinity
would be expected for all 3D-printed PEO-based materials, given the
apparent process-dependence of crystallinity, but higher crystallinity
measured in SLG:PEO and 45S5:PEO may additionally be due to the presence
of Na ions in the ink, which has been observed to increase crystallinity
in PEO.55 Because the atactic PS is completely
amorphous, no melting endotherm is observed in the PS-based materials
(Figure 5E) and crystallinity
is not calculated. The only visible endotherm for PS-based materials
peaks at approximately 420 °C (Figure 5E), which is associated with substantial
mass loss from the TGA measurement, and therefore corresponds to thermal
degradation of PS (Figure 5B). The exception is for the PS decomposition endotherm of
Fe:PS which peaks at approximately 450 °C. The mass loss curve
from the independent TGA measurement is correspondingly offset. The
PEO-based materials exhibit melting endotherms peaking at approximately
72 °C and thermal degradation (Figure 5F) at 350 °C (with corresponding mass
loss, Figure 5C), consistent
with previous observations.56 Thermal degradation
of PEO also leaves behind a larger proportion of nonvolatile carbon
residue, as seen in the larger mass fraction remaining in PEO-based
materials after thermal degradation. Previous reports indicate that
approximately 10% of the weight of PEO fails to become volatile, which
is consistent with our results.56,57

Notably, we observe
that the samples 45S5:PLGA and SLG:PLGA lack
the characteristic mass loss associated with the thermal degradation
of PLGA observed in the as-received, reprecipitated, and Fe-containing
PLGA materials and also observe that this difference is not found
in either the PS- or PEO-based materials. The evaporation and degradation
temperatures for lactide and glycolide monomers have been previously
reported and are indeed lower than those of the PLGA copolymer.58 Because of the 45S5 powder’s demonstrated
tendency to adsorb water from the air, we expect that some mass loss
occurring in 45S5-containing materials can be attributable to the
evaporation of water at and above 100 °C.59 In addition, it has been observed that 45S5 begins shedding
surface hydroxide (−OH) groups at approximately 400 °C.59 Desorption of surface hydroxides likely accounts
for the slow mass loss in 45S5-containing materials at or above this
temperature. The mass loss is most obvious in the 45S5:PLGA (Figure 5A) curve because
PLGA decomposes at the lowest temperature of the three polymers employed
in this study, exacerbated by the fact that degradation of polymer
shifts mass loss associated with the vaporization of the polymer or
its constituents to lower temperatures. Nevertheless, the loss associated
with evaporation of surface hydroxides is presumably present in the
45S5:PS and 45S5:PEO materials as well. Limited mass loss associated
with the evaporation of residual DBP and EGBE is also expected (at
approximately 340 and 171 °C, respectively).

Sintering and
Porosity
To focus on the effect of polymer
binders on the thermal processing and sintered microstructure, we
limit measurements in this study to the already-established metallic
Fe system.24 3D-printed cylinders of Fe:PLGA,
Fe:PS, and Fe:PEO were thermally processed under flowing forming gas
(95% N2/5% H2) by ramping from room temperature
to 450 °C and holding for 1 h to allow for binder burnout, followed
by a ramp to 900 °C and holding for 2 h before ramping down to
room temperature all at a rate of 5 °C/min. Cylinders before
and after sintering are shown in Figure 6A. The nitrogen/hydrogen gas mixture was
selected as the processing atmosphere in order to prevent oxidation
and thermochemically reduce any surface oxides already present on
the Fe particles. 3D-printed cylinders undergoing thermal processing
experience homogeneous shrinkage associated with binder burnout and
particle sintering and also preserve 3D-printed architecture without
warping, cracking, or the delamination of 3D-printed layers. No significant
differences in the radial shrinkage of the cylinders were observed
(Figure 6B); as expected,
the mass losses measured in Fe cylinders from PLGA and PS are both
narrowly distributed and significantly different from one another,
resulting from the different densities of the polymers (Figure 6C). More surprising is that
the Fe cylinders from PEO exhibited a much wider distribution in mass
loss between samples, and in aggregate are not significantly different
from the cylinders resulting from PLGA or PS (based on the polymer
density, the average mass loss is expected to be the greatest of the
three). The reason for this wider distribution is unclear, and it
is possible that distribution would narrow upon repeated measurement
with a larger sample size. Notably, different binders employed led
to significantly different porosities in the sintered Fe otherwise
subjected to identical thermal treatments. The average porosity (density)
exhibited by Fe resulting from Fe:PLGA was 27.2 ± 0.7% (72.8
± 0.7%), whereas Fe:PEO and Fe:PS exhibited lower porosities
of 15.0 ± 4.5% (85.0 ± 4.5%) and 5.0 ± 1.4% (95.0 ±
1.4%), respectively, as seen in Figure 6D. Representative micrographs demonstrating the porosity
of these samples are shown in Figure 6E–G. Combustion fusion analysis performed on
sintered samples indicates similarly limited dissolved N content across
tested samples (Figure S5A). Similar levels
of dissolved N indicate that N is likely not responsible for differences
in sintering, and therefore porosity, between measured samples, and
the relatively low levels of measured nitrogen generally indicate
that Fe samples are not adversely affected by sintering in a N2/H2 mixed atmosphere. Combustion fusion analysis
also indicates that carbon content in Fe trends qualitatively with
the contribution, by weight, of carbon in the polymer, which is expected
assuming that the polymer binder is the primary source of residual
carbon remaining after firing (Figure S5B). Of note is that both residual carbon contents (presumably from
polymer and solvents) and nitrogen contents in sintered Fe samples
are at levels approximately consistent with those in medium carbon
steels (0.31–0.60% C, and <130 ppm N), indicating that compositions
relevant for engineering applications are achievable without necessarily
requiring carbon or nitrogen additions or removal. Although the reason
for the observed difference in porosity is unclear and the subject
of additional work, any impact of the binding polymer on the sintered
porosity of metallic Fe may provide future users with the ability
to select a binder for 3D-printing which results in the most desirable
microstructure; for instance, nearly dense for a structural part,
or possibly more porous for an energy or catalytic application. Whether
these observations are true for other sintered metals, or ceramics
and glasses is the subject of future work.

Summary
We have demonstrated that
3D-Paints can be successfully synthesized
based on the incorporation of polystyrenes and polyethers, evidenced
by the use of PS and PEO in this study, in addition to the polyesters
demonstrated previously. The ability to incorporate binding polymers
with chemical stability in the presence of alkali cations has enabled
the 3D-printing of majority-by-volume 45S5 bioactive glass and soda-lime
glass, which chemically degrade the more-established PLGA, rendering
the material unprintable. More generally, the availability of binders
coming from different classes of polymers (polyesters, polyethers,
and polystyrenes demonstrated thus far) enables the user to select
a polymer binder which imparts the most desirable properties for the
application, which might range from serving as a simple mechanical
support for metal or ceramic greenbodies prior to thermal processing
to a bioresorbable implant for regenerative medicine. Included in
the selection criteria are price considerations, which are strengths
of the demonstrated PS and PEO compared to the better-established
and pricier PLGA (Millipore Sigma lists PLGA at $126.00/g, PS at $0.26/g
and PEO at $54.10/g at the time of this writing). Although not demonstrated
in this study, blends of polymers or polymer classes in the binding
contents of the 3D-printable materials may also enable a range of
properties tunable at the discretion of the user. In addition, multimaterial
3D-printing (either with inks made from the same particles but different
binders or with different particles as well) is possible and would
enable the fabrication of more complex structures, for example, using
PEO as a water-soluble support material. The inherent material flexibility
of 3D-Paints paired with the now-broadening selection of polymers
available as binders further expands the horizon for the use of 3D-Painting
in manufacturing for medical, structural, and energy applications.

Experimental
Section
3D-Ink Synthesis
3D-inks were synthesized in ratios
of 7:3 particles:polymer (by volume after solidification) by combining
particles (Fe (spheres, APS 1–3 μm, 98+% carbonyl iron,
Alfa Aesar), SLG (spheres, APS <25 μm, Mo-Sci), and 45S5
Bioactive Powder (APS <25 μm, Mo-Sci)) and EGBE, DBP solvents
(Sigma-Aldrich) with polymers first dissolved in excess DCM: PLGA,
(Resomer LG 824 S, 82:18 lactide:glycolide; density = 1.15 g/cm3, Evonik Industries, GmbH), PS (Mw = 350 000, density = 1.04 g/cm3, Sigma-Aldrich), and
PEO (Mw = 1 000 000, density = 1.21 g/cm3 Sigma-Aldrich) in a BioPlotter cartridge (Nordson EFD). PLGA-based
inks contain 0.9 g of EGBE, 0.45 g of DBP per cm3 powder,
PS-based inks contain 0.6 g of EGBE, 0.1 g of DBP per cm3 powder, and PEO-based inks contain 0.6 g of EGBE, 0.03 g DBP per
cm3 powder. The particle slurry is then added to the fully-dissolved
polymer solution and the ink is homogenized by vortex mixing for 2–3
min. After combination, the inks were thickened (via DCM evaporation)
to appropriate viscosity in a sonic water bath at elevated temperature
(40–50 °C).

3D-Printing
All 3D-printing was
performed at room temperature
using a 3D-BioPlotter (EnvisionTEC, GmbH) with extrusion pressures
ranging between 0.5 and 5.0 bar and linear speeds of 3–6 mm/s
for PEO-containing inks, and 8–15 mm/s for PLGA and PS-based
inks (see Figure S2). Inks were extruded
from a 410 μm diameter nozzle (Nordson EFD).

Rheology
Rheometry was performed using an MCR Rheometer
(Anton Paar) with a couette fixture (double-gap cylinder attachment,
gap distance = 0 mm) on PLGA-, PS-based inks, and the 20 mm parallel
plate attachment for PEO-based inks (gap distance = 1 mm). Rotational
tests were stress-controlled with a stress range of 100–0.01
Pa. Frequency sweeps were performed at a strain amplitude of 1%. All
tests were performed at 25 °C with the aid of a solvent trap,
and all tests had a measuring point duration of 3 s.

Mechanical
Testing
In order to eliminate the effect
of residual solvents on polymer mechanical properties (especially
DBP, the plasticizer), PLGA and PS-containing samples were washed
and lyophilized according to the method established in prior work.28 PEO-containing samples were washed in 100% ethanol
for 1 h and lyophilized until dry. Tensile measurements were performed
using an LF Plus Mechanical Tester (Lloyd Instruments, USA) with a
rate of extension of 2.0 mm/s. Six samples of each material were tested.
Compression tests were performed on compression cylinders (1 cm diameter,
2 cm tall) using an MTS Sintech 20G at a compression rate of 2.0 mm/s.

Thermal Measurements
TGA measurements were performed
using a SDTA851e Thermogravimetric Analyzer (Mettler Toledo), and
DSC measurements were performed using a DSC822e Differential Scanning
Calorimeter (Mettler Toledo), both under flowing N2 atmosphere
between 30 and 500 °C at heating rates of 10 °C/min.

Imaging
SEM imaging was performed using a Hitachi S-4800
under an accelerating voltage of 2 kV. Optical microscopy/metallography
was performed using an Olympus PMG3 inverted metallurgical microscope.

Sintering and Shrinkage/Porosity Analysis
Sintering
of 3D-printed Fe samples occurred in an alumina furnace boat inside
a tube furnace (Carbolite, Type CTF 17/300) under a flowing forming
gas atmosphere (5% H2/95% N2, ∼5 scfm,
Airgas). The furnace protocol involved a ramp at 5 °C/min to
450 °C and a subsequent hold lasting 1 h for complete polymer
pyrolysis, followed by another ramp at the same rate to 900 °C
for 2 h for Fe particle sintering and finally ramping down at 5 °C/min
to room temperature. Linear reduction measurements were performed
using a caliper and reported reduction was taken as the average radius
(of three measurements) before and after thermal processing. Mass
reduction was measured by weighing shrinkage cylinders before and
after thermal processing. Porosity was measured by a stereological
method using image analysis software ImageJ on polished sample cross
sections. In ImageJ, the “binarize” function is used
after setting a threshold to turn pixels either white or black (black
for pores, in this case). After binarizing, the pixels are counted,
thereby providing the fraction associated with pores. Images are captured
of six different regions of a single sample, and the average porosity
and standard deviation between regions are reported.

Elemental Analysis
Analysis of trace elemental compositions
was performed using combustion fusion analysis, performed externally
by Genitest, Inc. (Montreal, Canada).

Statistical Methods
Error bars represent one standard
deviation from the mean, and significance tests were two-tailed Student’s t-tests with two sample unequal variance with a p-value
of 0.05.
