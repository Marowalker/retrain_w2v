Curcumin (CURC) is a hydrophobic molecule and its water
solubility can be greatly improved by liposome encapsulation. However,
investigations on the stability of pH-sensitive molecules incorporated
into liposomal membranes are limited. In this study, CURC-loaded liposomes
with varied internal pH values (pH 2.5, 5.0, or 7.4) were prepared
and designated as CURC-LP (pH 2.5), CURC-LP (pH 5.0), and CURC-LP
(pH 7.4). Physical properties including particle size, ζ-potential,
morphology, entrapment efficiency, and physical stabilities of these
CURC-LPs were assessed. In addition, the chemical stability of liposomal
CURC to different external physiological environments and internal
microenvironmental pH levels were investigated. We found that among
these CURC-LPs, CURU-LP (pH 2.5) has the highest entrapment efficiency
(73.7%), the best physical stabilities, and the slowest release rate
in vitro. Liposomal CURC remains more stable in an acid external environment.
In the physiological environment, the chemical stability of liposomal
CURC is microenvironmental pH-dependent. In conclusion, we prove that
the stability of liposomal CURC is external physiological environment-
and internal microenvironmental pH-dependent. These findings suggest
that creating an acidic microenvironment in the internal chamber of
liposomes is beneficial to the stability of liposomal CURC, as well
as for other pH-sensitive molecules.

Introduction
Curcumin (CURC) is a natural yellow pigment derived from the rhizome
of the herb Curcuma longa. It exhibits
strong anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumor, antiviral, antibacterial,
and antifungal activities.1−6 Because of these desirable medicinal benefits,
especially its antitumor activity, CURC has been a research topic
of interest for years.7,8 However, it has a very poor aqueous
solubility and low stability in alkaline pH conditions.9−11 These features render CURC poor
oral bioavailability and low stability against the physiological environment
(neutral pH values). The therapeutic efficacy of CURC is limited,
and extensive studies have been devoted to overcoming this limitation.12−15

Liposomes are commonly used as transport vehicles for drugs, proteins,
vaccines, and diagnostic agents.16−21 Because liposomes are composed
of a hydrophobic lipid bilayer and a hydrophilic inner aqueous chamber,
lipophilic drugs can distribute in lipid bilayers at high percentages.
Therefore, the solubility of drugs in aqueous media can increase by
encapsulating these in liposomes.22−24 For CURC, such incorporation in liposomal membranes
may also increase its solubility in water and improve its stability
because incorporation in liposomal membranes can protect it against
hydrolytic degradation. Several recent studies have confirmed this
opinion.25−28

Generally, liposomes are prepared in a neutral
buffer solution; therefore, the loaded drug molecules are also in
a neutral environment after incorporation into liposomes.29,30 For a pH-sensitive hydrophilic drug located in the inner aqueous
chamber of the liposomes, it is easy to understand that its stability
would be significantly affected by the microenvironmental pH in the
aqueous chamber. However, as a pH-sensitive hydrophobic molecule,
whether the stability of CURC incorporated into the liposomal membranes
will be affected by the internal microenvironment of the liposomes
is quite interesting but lacks adequate research. So far, most of
the studies on liposomal CURC have focused exclusively on its biological
effectiveness, especially in anticancer treatment, and not much attention
has been given to the assessment of its stability.31,32

In the present study, CURC-loaded liposomes with varied internal
pH values (pH 2.5, 5.0, or 7.4) were prepared. The chemical stability
of liposomal CURC to the different external physiological environments
and internal microenvironmental pH values was investigated. This study
aimed to establish a novel approach to improve the stability of liposomal
CURC.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of LPs
The size, polydispersity
index (PDI), and ζ-potential of the three different kinds of
LPs are shown in Table 1.

Table 1 Size and ζ-Potential
of the Three
Different Kinds of Liposomesa
samples	size (nm)	PDI	ζ-potential (mV)	
LP (pH 2.5)	307.1 ± 24.2	0.36 ± 0.06	–19.15 ± 7.70	
LP (pH 5.0)	339.5 ± 31.8	0.38 ± 0.06	–21.15 ± 2.62	
LP (pH 7.4)	278.2 ± 28.1	0.33 ± 0.08	–9.43 ± 0.66	
a Data are presented
as mean ± s.d. (n = 3).

The three different kinds of obtained LPs had similar sizes
(around 300 nm). Size distribution is usually also presented as PDI,
a numerical value with a range of 0–1, i.e., the lower the
better. The PDI of each LP was similar at about 0.3 and shown in Figure 1. In contrast, the
ζ-potentials of these LPs were slightly different; the ζ-potentials
of LP (pH 2.5) and LP (pH 5.0) were similar at −19.15 ±
7.70 and −21.15 ± 2.62 mV, respectively. However, for
LP (pH 7.4), the ζ-potentials were lower (−9.43 ±
0.66). It is assumed that for LP (pH 7.4), the internal environment
was more alkaline, leading to lower ζ-potentials. In general,
a higher ζ-potential leads to a more stable colloidal suspension.
Similar to size distribution, the ζ-potential distribution of
all of the three kinds of LPs was narrow, indicating good ζ-potential
distribution for every type of LP.

2.5), (C, D) LP (pH 5.0), (E, F) LP (pH 7.4).

The morphology of LPs was
observed by SEM. Figure 2 shows that the three kinds of LPs were all spherical, and the particle
size of every type of LP was evenly distributed, indicating good size
distribution, which coincides with the results derived from the DLS
measurement.

Characterization of CURC-LPs
The size, polydispersity index (PDI), ζ-potential, and encapsulation
efficiency of the three kinds of CURC-LPs are shown in Table 2.

CURC-LP (pH 5.0)	342.2 ± 37.1	0.27 ± 0.03	–18.37 ± 2.31	40 ± 2.2	
CURC-LP (pH
7.4)	309 ± 37.9	0.15 ± 0.03	–9.15 ± 1.24	64 ± 1	
a Data are presented as the mean ± s.d. (n =
3).

The size of every CURC-LP
was larger than LPs prepared from the same internal microenvironmental
pH values. Interestingly, the PDI of CURC-LPs was lower, which means
the particle size of CURC-LPs was more evenly distributed than LPs.
However, for ζ-potential, there were no obvious differences
between the CURC-LPs and LPs prepared using the same internal microenvironmental
pH values. Typical size and ζ-potential distribution graphs
of the three kinds of CURC-LPs are shown in Figure 3. The EE of the CURC was 73.7 ± 1.6,
40 ± 2.2, and 64 ± 1% with respect to CURC-LP (pH 2.5),
CURC-LP (pH 5.0), and CURC-LP (pH 7.4). The EE of CURC-LP (pH 2.5)
was the highest, indicating that internal microenvironmental pH 2.5
is optimal for liposomal CURC compared with pH 5.0 and 7.4 in terms
of EE. This may be related to the solubility and stabilities of CURC
in different environmental acid/alkali solvents.

Physical Stability of LPs
The physical
stability of LPs is very important for their storage, safety, and
application. LPs are colloidal systems and their physical stability
can be assessed in terms of colloidal stability. Particle aggregation
(thermodynamic instability) is an essential feature of colloidal instability.
Thus, in this study, we investigated the thermodynamic stabilities
of three kinds of LPs by monitoring changes in particle size. The
measured size at the fixed time intervals compared to the initial
size is the relative size, as shown in Figure 4A.

Figure 4 Stability of the three
kinds of liposomes over a 48 h period at 37 °C. (A) Thermodynamic
stability of liposomes by assessing changes in particle size and (B)
size changes after incubation with an equal volume of FBS and PBS
(pH 7.4, 0.001 M) within 48 h. Data are presented as mean ± SD
(n = 3).

We can see that the relative sizes
of the three kinds of LPs were relatively stable within 48 h. There
was no significant statistical difference within every time point
for any kind of LP. These results indicate that the size of every
type of LP did not significantly change for at least 48 h. Thus, all
three kinds of LPs had high thermodynamic stability for at least 48
h at 37 °C. This suggests that the internal microenvironmental
pH values do not influence the physical stability of LPs.

Chemical Stability of LPs in FBS
The chemical
stability of LPs in serum is also very important when LPs are used
in vivo. Once LPs enter the blood, these adsorb onto plasma proteins
or aggregate with each other, leading to a change in the LPs and initially
present as an increase in particle size. The measured size at the
fixed time intervals compared to the initial size is shown in Figure 4B. For all of the
three kinds of LPs, changes in the average size of the LPs were relatively
minimal within 48 h and differences were not statistically significant.
These findings suggest that all of the three kinds of LPs were highly
stable in FBS for at least 48 h at 37 °C, indicating that the
internal microenvironmental pH does not influence the chemical stability
of LPs in FBS.

Chemical Stability
of Liposomal CURC to Different External Environment pH Values
CURC has low stability under alkaline pH conditions, and its incorporation
into liposomal membranes may improve its stability. However, the stability
of liposomal CURC to different external environment pH values remains
unclear. To understand this problem, we investigated the stability
of CURC-LP (pH 7.4) to three different external environment pH values
(pH 2.5, pH 5.0, and pH 7.4). As shown in Figure 5A, in all of the three pH values, the remaining
percentage of CURC was lower over time. However, CURC-LP (pH 7.4)
in the pH 2.5 external environment was more stable compared with pH
5.0 or pH 7.4, suggesting that CURC incorporated into LPs is still
influenced by the acid and alkali of the external environment, and
thus is still more stable in an acid environment.

external pH conditions, and stability of three kinds of liposome-encapsulated
curcumin at pH 7.4. (A) In vitro stability of curcumin in CURC-LP
(pH 7.4) over a 24 h period in an equal volume of FBS and PBS (pH

100 rpm. (B) In vitro stability of curcumin in three kinds of CURC-LPs

as mean ± SD (n = 3). P values
<0.05 are considered statistically significant, as indicated by &, *, and #; & pH
2.5 vs. pH 5.0, * pH 2.5 vs. pH 7.4, # pH 5.0
vs. pH 7.4.

The observed
differences in stability may be explained by the fact that CURC has
three ionizable protons, one each from the two phenolic OH groups
and the third from the enolic proton.33 The pKa values for the dissociation
of the three ionizable protons in CURC have previously been determined
as 7.8, 8.5, and 9.0, respectively, by Tønnesen and Karlsen in
1985. In addition, in the neutral or alkaline environment, once dissociation
occurs, CURC undergoes rapid hydrolytic degradation and becomes unstable.
As a lipophilic drug, CURC can be incorporated into liposomal membranes,
which may protect it against hydrolytic degradation and increase its
stability and has been proven in many investigations. However, when
LPs are dispersed in the serum, lipophilic CURC incorporated within
the LP membranes will possibly leak out at a degree that depends on
the log P value of the particular compound,
its aqueous solubility at physiological pH, and its affinity to plasma
proteins.34 Thus, CURC that leaks out of
the liposomal CURC will be affected by the pH conditions. Thus, CURC
incorporated into LPs is also influenced by the acidic and alkaline
conditions of the external environment. This suggests that an acidic
external environment for liposomal CURC is more conducive for its
storage and further applications.

Chemical Stability of CURC-LPs in the Physiological Environment
Based on the results of the experiment described earlier, we have
proven that CURC incorporated into LPs is also influenced by the acidic
and alkaline conditions of the external environment. To determine
whether the stability of CURC-LPs is affected by the internal microenvironmental
pH in the aqueous chamber of the liposomes, we investigated the chemical
stability of CURC-LPs in 50% pH 7.4 FBS. As shown in Figure 5B, in pH 7.4 FBS, the remaining
percentage of CURC in the three kinds of CURC-LPs decreased over time.
However, after 24 h, the remaining percentage of CURC in CURC-LP (pH
2.5) was the highest compared with CURC-LP (pH 5.0) or CURC-LP (pH
7.4) at every time point, indicating that CURC in CURC-LP (pH 2.5)
is the most stable at pH 7.4, at least in the first 24 h. Using pH
2.5 as the internal microenvironment during the preparation of CURC-loaded
LPs is optimal. Phospholipids are amphiphilic molecules containing
a water-soluble hydrophilic head section and a lipid-soluble hydrophobic
tail section. Therefore, the space in the lipid bilayer would not
be absolutely anhydrous for the transport of water-soluble molecules.
A certain volume of the buffer solution with the same components as
the inner chamber would exist in the hydrophobic lipid bilayer after
the preparation of liposome. Thus, the hydrophobic molecule incorporation
into liposomal membranes still can be affected by the internal microenvironment
pH. In addition, the highest stability of CURC in CURC-LP (pH 2.5)
may due to the high efficiency of CURC encapsulation and better physical
construction of the vesicles when compared with CURC in CURC-LP (pH
5.0) or CURC-LP (pH 7.4). Hence, creating an acidic microenvironment
in the internal chamber of LPs is beneficial to the stability of liposomal
CURC.

In Vitro Release Study
The drug release profile of LPs is usually examined to evaluate formulation
quality and predict the effectiveness in vivo because the release
profile obtained in vitro can reflect the drug’s performance
in vivo. Traditionally, drug release from LPs may occur in three ways:
(a) the drug molecules that are adsorbed on the surface of liposome
are released via desorption once these come into contact with the
release medium, (b) the encapsulated drugs in the LPs are released
by diffusion through the LPs’ skeleton, or/and (c) following
the degradation or disintegration of LPs. Meanwhile, the drugs in
the release medium are influenced by the release medium. In this study,
the PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% (m/v) of the Tween-80 was used as
the release medium, and we detected the existence of CURC in the release
medium at specific time points for 48 h. The release profile is shown
in Figure 6.

Figure 6 In vitro release
profiles of the three kinds of CURC-LPs in PBS containing 0.1% (m/v)
of the Tween-80 (pH 7.4). Data are presented as the mean ± SD
(n = 3). P values <0.05 were
considered as statistically significant, as indicated by * for comparison
in CURC-LP (pH 2.5) vs CURC-LP (pH 7.4).

As shown in Figure 6, the release profiles of all of the three CURC-LPs were close to
a straight line, indicating that CURC-LPs exhibit a constant drug
release rate. The amount of CURC was highest in the CURC-LP (pH 2.5)
compared with CURC-LP (pH 5.0) or CURC-LP (pH 7.4) at every time point.
These findings suggest that CURC in the CURC-LP (pH 2.5) may be most
stable in the PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% (m/v) of the Tween-80 compared
with CURC-LP (pH 5.0) or CURC-LP (pH 7.4). This is consistent with
our results above.

The water solubility of CURC can be significantly
improved by loading into LPs, and its stability may also be improved
by the physiological environment. In our present study, we proved
that liposomal CURC is still more stable in an acidic external environment.
Even after incorporation in liposomal membranes, the stability of
liposomal CURC continues to be influenced by the internal microenvironmental
pH in the aqueous chamber of the liposomes. Therefore, creating an
acidic microenvironment in the internal chamber of LPs is beneficial
to the stability of liposomal CURC. It may also provide some guidance
for the optimal preparation of other liposomal pH-sensitive drug payloads.

Experimental Section
Materials
Curcumin (CURC) was purchased
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Phospholipids (soybean lecithin for injection
use, with phosphatidylcholine content >70%) were purchased from
Shanghai Tai-Wei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Cholesterol
was purchased from Amresco (Solon, OH). Poloxamer 188 (F68) was obtained
from BASF (China) Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Fetal bovine serum
(FBS) was obtained from HyClone (Logan, UT). All other chemical reagents
used in this study were of analytical grade or better.

Preparation of Liposomes and CURC-Loaded Liposomes
with Different Internal Microenvironmental pH Values
The
liposomes with different internal microenvironmental pH values were
prepared using the evaporation method with some modifications. First,
the weighed phospholipids and cholesterol (15:1, w/w) were dissolved
in absolute ethanol and served as the organic phase. Three different
kinds of pH values (pH 2.5, pH 5.0, and pH 7.4) of phosphate-buffered
solutions (PBS, 0.001 mol/L, the concentration of phosphate ions)
containing 1% (w/w) F68 were used as the aqueous phase. Here, F68
served as a surfactant to narrow the size distribution. Using magnetic
stirring, the resulting organic solution was slowly dripped into the
aqueous phase at a volume ratio of 1:10, followed by evaporation at
35 °C for 30 min to remove the ethanol. The suspension was centrifuged
at a high speed (16 000 rpm for 10 min), and the pellets were
resuspended in PBS (pH 7.4) to provide these liposomes (LPs) with
an identical external environment. Finally, liposome suspensions were
obtained and designated as LP (pH 2.5), LP (pH 5.0), and LP (pH 7.4).

CURC-loaded liposomes were prepared by co-dissolving CURC, phospholipids,
and cholesterol in ethanol following the same procedures as earlier
described. After evaporation, the suspension was centrifuged at a
low speed (3000 rpm for 5 min) to precipitate free CURC. Then, the
supernatant was centrifuged at high speed (16 000 rpm for 10
min), and the pellets were resuspended in PBS (pH 7.4). Finally, the
CURC-loaded liposomes with different internal microenvironmental pH
values were obtained and designated as CURU-LP (pH 2.5), CURU-LP (pH
5.0), and CURU-LP (pH 7.4). For liposomes and CURC-loaded liposomes,
the final concentration of the phospholipids was 15 mg/mL, cholesterol
was 1 mg/mL, and CURC 0.2 mg/mL.

Characterization
of LPs and CURC-LPs
The particle size, size distribution,
and ζ-potential of various LPs and CURC-LPs were detected by
dynamic light scattering (DLS) and electrophoretic light scattering
(ELS) technologies, respectively, using the instrument of Zetasizer
Nano ZS90 (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, U.K.). The particle
size was assessed in terms of intensity distribution, and the polydispersity
index (PDI) was used to evaluate size distribution.

The morphology
of LPs was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, INSPECT
F, FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Before conducting SEM, one drop
of the properly diluted LP suspension was placed on a clean glass
sheet, followed by air-drying. Then, the samples were coated with
gold.

Entrapment Efficiency of CURC
The entrapment efficiency of CURC in various CURC-LPs was determined
by the high-speed centrifugation method. Briefly, various CURC-LPs
were centrifuged at 16 000 rpm for 5 min. Then, the supernatant
was assayed by fluorescent spectrophotometry (excitation, 458 nm;
emission, 548 nm) and presented as F1,
i.e., the fluorescent intensity of nonencapsulated CURC. Meanwhile,
the same volume of the total CURC-LPs was measured by fluorescent
spectrophotometry and presented as F0,
i.e., the fluorescent intensity of total CURC. The experiments were
performed in triplicate. The encapsulation efficiency (EE) of the
curcumin was calculated using the following equation: EE% = (F0 – F1)/F0 × 100%.

Physical Stability of LPs
In this study, we detected the
physical stability of LPs by measuring their thermodynamic stability.
The freshly prepared LPs (0.15 mL) were incubated at 37 °C. At
fixed time intervals, the liposome suspension was vortexed and the
particle size was measured and compared to the initial size to determine
their thermodynamic stability.

Chemical
Stability of LPs in FBS
The freshly prepared LPs (1.4 mL)
were added to each centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 16 000
rpm for 5 min. Then, the supernatant was discarded, and 1.4 mL was
mixed with an equal volume of FBS and PBS (pH 7.4, 0.001 mol/L), followed
by vortex blending. The resuspended liposomes in equal volumes of
FBS and PBS were placed on a horizontal shaker (70 rpm, 37 ±
1 °C). At the fixed time intervals, 90 μL of the liposome
suspension was aliquoted and diluted 10 times with distilled water,
and the particle size was measured and compared.

Chemical Stability of Liposomal CURC to Different
External Environmental pH Values
To investigate whether the
chemical stability of liposomal curcumin is influenced by the external
environment pH values, we detected the stability of CURC in CURC-LP
(pH 7.4) under different external pH values (pH 2.5, pH 5.0, and pH
7.4). Briefly, the freshly prepared CURC-LP (pH 7.4) was diluted 10
times by PBS (pH 7.4, 0.001 mol/L), then 1 mL of the diluted solution
was added to the tube and centrifuged at 16 000 rpm for 5 min.
The supernatant was discarded, and 1 mL was mixed with an equal volume
of FBS and PBS (pH 2.5, pH 5.0, or pH 7.4, 0.001 mol/L), followed
by vortex blending. The resuspended solution was placed on a horizontal
shaker (70 rpm, 37 ± 1 °C). At fixed time intervals (0,
2, 4, 6, 24, and 48 h), 10 μL of the solution was aliquoted
and added to 300 μL of absolute ethanol to dissolve the liposome
and extract CURC. The samples were stored at −80 °C until
analysis. After all samples were collected, these were centrifuged
at 12 000 rpm for 3 min, and 200 μL of the supernatant
was measured by fluorescent spectrophotometry (excitation: 458 nm;
emission: 548 nm). The measured fluorescent intensity at the fixed
time intervals (2, 4, 6, 24, and 48 h) was compared to the fluorescent
intensity at 0 h.

Chemical Stability
of CURC-LPs in the Physiological Environment
The chemical
stability of CURC-LPs in the physiological environment was examined
in 50% FBS. Briefly, the prepared CURC-LP (pH 2.5), CURC-LP (pH 5.0),
and CURC-LP (pH 7.4) were diluted 10 times with PBS (pH 2.5, pH 5.0,
or pH 7.4, 0.001 mol/L), followed by the addition of 1 mL of the diluted
solution and centrifugation at 16 000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant
was discarded, and 1 mL of the suspension was mixed with an equal
volume of FBS and PBS (pH 7.4, 0.001 mol/L) and then vortexed. The
remaining procedures were the same as described earlier.

In Vitro Release Study
The in vitro release
property of CURC-LP (pH 2.5), CURC-LP (pH 5.0), and CURC-LP (pH 7.4)
was investigated using the dynamic dialysis method.35 Briefly, 1 mL of CURC-LP (pH 2.5), CURC-LP (pH 5.0), or
CURC-LP (pH 7.4) was added into a dialysis bag (molecular weight cutoff:
10 000D). Then, the sample-loaded dialysis bag was tightly
bundled at the two ends and soaked in 6 mL of release medium [PBS
containing 0.1% (m/v) of the Tween-80, pH 7.4] and placed on a horizontal
shaker (70 rpm, 37 ± 1 °C). At fixed time intervals (2,
4, 6, 8, 24, and 48 h), the release medium was collected and replaced
with 6 mL of fresh release medium. The collected samples were stored
at −80 °C for further analysis by fluorescent spectrophotometry.
After all samples were collected, these were centrifuged at 12 000
rpm for 3 min, and 200 μL of the supernatant was measured by
fluorescence spectrophotometry (excitation: 458 nm; emission: 548
nm).

Statistical Analysis
All assays in this study were repeated at least thrice. A one-way
ANOVA was used to analyze differences among groups. In all tables
and figures, representative data are presented as the mean ±
standard deviation. P values <0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
