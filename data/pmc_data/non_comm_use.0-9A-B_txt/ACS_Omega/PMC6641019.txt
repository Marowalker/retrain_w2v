Graphene oxide (GO) is an ultrathin
carbon nanosheet with various
oxygen-containing functional groups. The utilization of GO has attracted
tremendous attention in a number of areas, such as electronics, optics,
optoelectronics, catalysis, and bioengineering. Here, we report the
development of GO-based solid electrolyte gas sensors that can continuously
detect combustible gases at low concentrations. GO membranes were
fabricated by filtration using a colloidal solution containing GO
nanosheets synthesized by a modified Hummers’ method. The GO
membrane exposed to humid air showed good proton-conducting properties
at room temperature, as confirmed by hydrogen concentration cell measurements
and complex impedance analyses. Gas sensor devices were fabricated
using the GO membrane fitted with a Pt/C sensing electrode. The gas-sensing
properties were examined by potentiometric and amperometric techniques.
The GO sensor showed high, stable, and reproducible responses to hydrogen
at parts per million concentrations in humid air at room temperature.
The sensing mechanism is explained in terms of the mixed-potential
theory. Our results suggest the promising capability of GO for the
electrochemical detection of combustible gases.

Introduction
Solid electrolyte gas
sensors have been widely used for emission
control, process control, and environmental protection in various
fields.1,2 Carbon monoxide (CO) sensors composed of
proton conductors, such as perfluoro-3,6-dioxa-4-methyl-7-octenesulfonic
acid (Nafion; Du Pont), are an important example of such sensors.3−5 These devices are also called fuel-cell-type sensors and utilize
a change in the electrode potential or electrical current upon interaction
with gas to produce the sensor signal. In particular, fuel-cell-type
CO sensors have gained a large market share, particularly in the United
States and Europe, due to their good performance and low power consumption.

The prototype of this sensor was developed by Miura et al.,6 who reported that a proton-conducting Nafion
membrane fitted with noble metal electrodes showed good electromotive
force (EMF) responses to combustible gases, such as H2 and
CO, in air at room temperature. The EMF response did not follow Nernstian
behavior, indicating the simultaneous occurrence of anodic and cathodic
reactions that generate a mixed potential at the sensing electrode.
Zirconium phosphate and antimonic acid were also used as proton conductors
in this sensor.7,8 Furthermore, they applied this
sensor to the amperometric detection of H2 and CO. The
electrical currents generated from electrochemical reactions of the
target gases are linearly dependent on the gas concentration.9 The good sensing performance at room temperature
makes this device suitable for practical and commercial applications.
Several types of polymeric proton conductors have been developed.10,11 However, very few materials have been applied in this type of gas
sensor.12−14 A probable reason for this is that Nafion has several
advantages over other materials, including high proton conductivities
(approximately 10–2 S cm–1) at
room temperature, excellent thermal and mechanical stability, and
flexibility.

In this study, we applied graphene oxide (GO) as
a new material
in solid electrolyte gas sensors. GO is a two-dimensional carbon nanosheet
covered with oxygen-containing functional groups and can be synthesized
via the oxidation and exfoliation of graphite. GO serves as a precursor
of graphene. However, its versatile functionalities, which are different
from those of graphene, have recently attracted much attention for
use in various applications, including catalysis, batteries, capacitors,
solar cells, etc.15−17 In particular, due to the proton-conducting properties
of GO,18−20 GO membranes have successfully been applied to fuel
cells.21−23 Thus, it is readily expected that GO is a potential
material for fuel-cell-type gas sensors. GO has already been applied
to several gas sensors, such as resistive sensors,24 impedance sensors,25 transistor
sensors,26 and optical sensors.27,28 However, to the best of our knowledge, the application of GO to
solid electrolyte gas sensors has not yet been reported. The advantages
of GO are that it is composed of earth-abundant carbon and does not
contain rare or toxic elements, the fabrication of GO membranes is
not complex, and no expensive or large facilities are required for
its production. This is in distinct contrast to the high price of
Nafion resulting from its complicated and very toxic production routes.29,30 Furthermore, a GO membrane is an assembly of nanosheets and, as
such, the membrane can accommodate water in its interlayer. Thus,
GO sensors may function even at low relative humidity (RH). Here,
we demonstrate the potential capability of GO-based solid electrolyte
gas sensors. The proton-conducting properties of GO membranes were
studied by hydrogen concentration cell measurements and complex impedance
analyses. Using GO membranes, sensor devices were fabricated and their
gas-sensing properties to combustible gases was examined by potentiometric
and amperometric methods. The sensing mechanism was also discussed
in terms of the electrode reaction kinetics.

Experimental Section
Synthesis
of GO Colloids
GO nanosheets were synthesized
from graphite powder via a modified Hummers’ method.31 First, graphite powder (2.0 g) was added to
concentrated sulfuric acid (92 mL) under stirring, followed by the
addition of sodium nitrate (2.0 g). The mixture was cooled in an ice
bath for 30 min. Subsequently, potassium permanganate (10 g) was added
slowly into the mixture. Then, the reaction system was slowly transferred
to a water bath and heated at 35 °C for 40 min. Distilled water
(92 mL) was added slowly to the solution, which was stirred for another
5 h in an oil bath at 95 °C. Additionally, distilled water (200
mL) and hydrogen peroxide were added until the color of the solution
changed from brown to yellow. After cooling, the product was recovered
by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The recovered precipitate
was washed with an aqueous HCl solution (5%) three times to remove
metal ions. The removal of acid was achieved by repeated washing with
distilled water and subsequent centrifugation. The obtained solid
was dispersed in distilled water, followed by ultrasonication for
4–6 h. The resulting dispersion was subjected to centrifugation
at 10 000 rpm for 30 min to remove aggregates. Finally, the
supernatant was separated to obtain a colloidal suspension containing
GO nanosheets.

Fabrication of the GO Membrane
A
self-supporting membrane
was fabricated on two filter membranes stacked together using the
GO suspension (3.5 mg/mL) by vacuum filtration. One filter membrane
had 0.4 μm pores, whereas the other had 180 μm pores.
The 180 μm filter was used as the supporting filter for the
0.4 μm filter. The filtration process produced a GO membrane
with a thickness of 180 μm. This process was carried out under
atmospheric air conditions.

Materials Characterization
The synthesized
GO nanosheets
were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu Kα radiation
(MiniFlex600; Rigaku). The presence of oxygen-containing functional
groups on GO was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy
(FTIR4100; JASCO) and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 1600;
PerkinElmer). GO membranes synthesized by the above method were used
for the XRD, FT-IR, and XPS analyses. The morphology of the GO membrane
was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7600F; JEOL).
The proton conductivity of the GO membrane was examined by complex
impedance spectroscopy. Pt electrodes were sputtered onto both sides
of the membrane, and the electrical contacts were composed of Ni meshes
and Ni wires. The impedance was measured in air under humid conditions
(2–90% RH) at room temperature by an impedance analyzer (1260;
Solartron).

Sensor Fabrication and Sensing Tests
Two types of sensors
were fabricated. Figure 1a shows the structural schematic of the concentration cell-type GO
sensor. The device was fitted with commercial Pt (46.3%)/C (TEC10E50E;
Tanaka Holdings Co., Ltd.) as the sensing electrode. A Pt/C powder
was dispersed in isopropanol, and the suspension was dropped onto
the GO membrane to form the sensing layer. Pt-black was coated on
the other side of the membrane as the reference electrode. To fix
the potential of the reference electrode, atmospheric air was introduced
to the reference electrode side. The electrodes were covered with
Ni meshes (50 mesh). This device structure was also used for hydrogen
concentration cell measurements, in which hydrogen in Ar was introduced
to the sensing and reference electrodes. In this case, Pt/C was used
for both the sensing and reference electrodes.

Figure 1 Structures of the (a)
concentration cell-type and (b) planar-type
GO sensors. (c) Experimental setup of the flow apparatus for the concentration
cell-type sensor. For the planar-type sensor, no reference gas was
used.

The structure of a planar-type
sensor is shown in Figure 1b. Pt/C was used as the sensing
electrode, whereas a perovskite-type oxide was used as the counter
electrode. Perovskite-type oxide La0.6Sr0.4Co0.78Ni0.02Fe0.2O3 was prepared
by an evaporation method.32 The perovskite-type
oxide powder was mixed with distilled water to form a paste, which
was applied to one side of the GO membrane and dried at room temperature.
The sensing and counter electrodes were exposed to the sample gases.

The sample gases, including hydrogen, oxygen, and ethanol, were
prepared by mixing parent commercial gases with synthetic air and
were introduced to the sensing electrode side. Water vapor was prepared
by bubbling synthetic air through distilled water and mixed with the
dry sample gases to control the RH. The RH of the sample gas was determined
by a humidity sensor. The flow rate of the sample and reference gases
was 100 mL/min. The EMF generated between the sensing and counter
electrodes was measured with an electrometer. The sensor response
was defined as |ΔEMF| (EMF in gas – EMF in air). For
the amperometric detection of hydrogen, the planar-type gas sensor
was used. The electrical currents (I) generated with
the applied voltage (1.2 V) were measured with an electrometer. The
sensor response was defined as |ΔI| (I in gas – I in air). All measurements
were carried out at room temperature.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of GO
Figure 2a shows a representative FT-IR spectrum of
GO. The peaks corresponding to the vibrational modes of oxygen-containing
functional groups are clearly observed in the spectrum. Namely, the
presence of hydroxyl (O–H, C–OH), carboxyl and carbonyl
(C=O), and epoxy (C–O–C) groups can be confirmed.33,34Figure 2b shows the
C (1s) XPS spectrum of GO. The peak at 285 eV corresponds to C–C,
C=C, and C–H bonds, whereas the peak at 287 eV can be
attributed to the C–OH, C–O–C, and C=O
bonds. The small peak at 289 eV is attributed to the O–C–OH
bonds in the carboxyl groups. The peak assignments were made according
to the literature.34,35 The deconvoluted XPS spectrum
suggests a high content of epoxy groups in GO. The oxygen content
in GO was determined to be 57 wt %.

Particle size distribution
in the colloidal GO suspension and (d) XRD pattern of the GO membrane.

Figure 2c shows
the particle size distribution of a colloidal GO suspension. The particle
size ranged from 70 to 800 nm. The size distribution is rather wide,
suggesting the partial decomposition of GO nanosheets during the oxidation
process. The GO suspension showed excellent colloidal stability; no
particle sedimentation occurred when the suspension was stored for
over a year. The surface charge of the GO nanosheets was determined
to be −80 mV by zeta potential measurements. This highly charged
surface should originate from the presence of oxygen-containing functional
groups at the surface, which prevented the aggregation of GO nanosheets
in the suspension. Figure 2d shows the XRD pattern of a membrane composed of GO nanosheets.
The GO membrane exhibited a peak at a low angle of 10.78°, which
is typical for layered materials. The interlayer distance of the stacked
GO nanosheets was determined to be 8.20 Å, which is in good agreement
with the reported results.33−35 The stacking of GO nanosheets
can also be confirmed by the cross-sectional SEM image of the GO membrane,
as shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information).
The obtained membrane was pinhole-free and dense, as confirmed by
He permeation tests.

Potentiometric Response of the Concentration
Cell-Type GO Sensor
To examine proton conduction in the GO
membrane, the EMF response
of a hydrogen concentration cell containing the GO membrane was measured.
The concentration of hydrogen in Ar (90% RH) was changed from 1 to
5%, whereas the concentration was fixed to 5% at the reference side. Figure 3 shows the EMF response
of the concentration cell upon changing the hydrogen concentration
at room temperature. The EMF was linearly dependent on the logarithm
of the hydrogen concentration, obeying the Nernst equation as follows 1  where R is the gas constant, T is
the absolute temperature, F is the
Faraday constant, n is the reaction number, t is the transport number, and CH2 is the hydrogen concentration. The slope of the curve
was calculated to be 28.75 mV/decade, which is close to the theoretical
value of 29.53 mV/decade if it is assumed that t equals
unity. In this case, the following equilibrium reaction is assumed
to proceed at the electrodes 2  Thus, the results clearly indicate
that proton
conduction occurs in the GO membrane and protons are in electrochemical
equilibrium with hydrogen in the gas phase. The proton conduction
should result from the presence of oxygen-containing functional groups,
as confirmed by the FT-IR and XPS results (Figure 2). However, a deviation from the theoretical
value was observed in the slope, suggesting the occurrence of electron
conduction in GO. Taking this into consideration, t can be calculated to be 0.91. A t value lower than
unity has also been reported for a GO membrane by Gao et al.23 They reported that treatment with ozone increased
the proton conductivity of GO due to an increase in the content of
oxygen-containing functional groups. Thus, the low t value may result from the removal of oxygen-containing functional
groups from GO during measurements in which the GO membrane was exposed
to highly reducing conditions. On the other hand, we reported previously
that the controlled removal of oxygen-containing functional groups
makes GO a mixed (proton and electron) conducting material.36,37 Nevertheless, the results confirmed that the GO membrane fitted
with Pt/C electrodes strongly responded to changes in the hydrogen
concentration at room temperature, although electron conduction also
occurred in the GO membrane.

Figure 3 Dependence of EMF on the hydrogen concentration
in Ar (90% RH at
both electrode sides) at room temperature for a hydrogen concentration
cell composed of the GO membrane. The inset shows the change in response.

We next applied the GO membrane
for the detection of hydrogen in
parts per million (ppm) concentration in air. The in situ sensing
of hydrogen is very important for the detection of hydrogen leakage
during its production, storage, and utilization. Figure 4 shows the EMF response of
the GO sensor in air (35% RH) containing hydrogen (50–300 ppm)
at room temperature as a function of hydrogen concentration. Atmospheric
air was introduced to the reference electrode in this case. The GO
sensor quickly responded to hydrogen. Its EMF was very stable and
reproducible, as shown in Figure S2. The
EMF repeatedly stabilized upon repeated cycles of exposure to H2 and air atmospheres. The 90% response and recovery times
were below 10 and 15 min, respectively. The sensor response, defined
as ΔEMF, was dependent on the hydrogen concentration and was
linearly related to the logarithm of the hydrogen concentration, as
observed for the concentration cell. The observed good hydrogen-sensing
ability should result from proton conduction in the GO membrane, which
occurs along the oxygen-containing functional groups. It should be
noted that the slope of the curve (86 mV/decade) was 3 times larger
than that for the concentration cell (28.75 mV/decade). Such deviation
from the ideal behavior expected from the Nernst equation was first
observed in zirconia-based oxygen sensors.38,39 The generation of the large EMF response is explained by the mixed-potential
theory.40 According to this theory, the
simultaneous occurrence of the following anodic and cathodic reactions
can be suggested in the present case 3   4  Miura et al. proposed the following equation
to show the dependence of EMF on the gas concentration by considering
that the net current is zero when the two reactions occur simultaneously.40 5  where Em is the
mixed potential and mA and mB are constants. This equation is valid provided that
oxygen reduction and hydrogen oxidation both obey the Butler–Volmer
equation or oxygen reduction follows the Butler–Volmer equation
and hydrogen oxidation is limited by mass transport. The observed
EMF response was in good agreement with the EMF behavior expected
from the above equation; the EMF was dependent on the logarithm of
the hydrogen concentration, and the slope of the curve, corresponding
to mA, had a negative value (−86
mV/decade). Thus, the results indicate that the EMF response of the
GO sensor is explained by the mixed-potential theory. This means that
the response is kinetically controlled by the two electrochemical
reactions.

Figure 4 Dependence of EMF on the hydrogen concentration (50–300
ppm) in air (35% RH) at room temperature for the concentration cell-type
sensor with an air reference. The inset shows the change in response.

Principally, this type of sensor
responds to combustible gases
such as CO and alcohol. Here, we examined the sensitivity to ethanol
to examine the selectivity for hydrogen, as shown in Figure 5a. The sensor response to ethanol
was negligibly small. The small response to ethanol is probably due
to the efficient heterogeneous combustion of ethanol at the Pt/C electrode
because a relatively thick sensing electrode (ca. 100 mm) was used.
This limits the diffusion of ethanol to the three-phase interface
(TPI) between GO and Pt/C, significantly decreasing the sensor response
to ethanol. In contrast, the diffusion rate of hydrogen is probably
high even in such a thick film electrode.41 Control of the microstructure and thickness of the sensing electrode
would lead to sensor responses to various gases, such as ethanol and
toluene, as reported for high-temperature mixed-potential-type gas
sensors.42 The response to oxygen was also
examined in the absence of hydrogen. The GO sensor responded to oxygen,
as shown in Figure 5a. The response trend was similar to that of the hydrogen concentration
cell (Figure 3). The
dependence of EMF on the oxygen concentration was linearly related
to the logarithm of the oxygen concentration, and the slope was 13
mV/decade, which is in good agreement with the theoretical slope (14.8
mV/decade) for the oxygen equilibrium reaction with n = 4 shown below. 6  Thus, in the absence of combustible gases,
the response to oxygen obeys Nernstian behavior. It can be concluded
that the GO sensor is not sensitive to small changes in the oxygen
concentration because the observed and theoretical EMF dependence
on the oxygen concentration is small. Figure 5b shows the effects of RH on the EMF response
to hydrogen. The EMF values to hydrogen and their dependence on the
hydrogen concentration (slope of the curve) were influenced by a change
in humidity, but the influence was not significant at 20–50%
RH. On the other hand, no stable response was obtained under dry conditions,
as shown in Figure S3.

Figure 5 (a) EMF responses to
ethanol and oxygen in air (35% RH) at room
temperature for the concentration cell-type sensor with an air reference.
(b) Effect of humidity on the response to hydrogen (10–50%
RH).

To elucidate the cause of the
humidity effect on the EMF response,
the proton conductivity and charge-transfer resistance at different
relative humidities were analyzed by complex impedance spectroscopy. Figure 6a shows the complex
impedance plane plots (Cole–Cole plots) of the GO membrane
in air with different relative humidities at room temperature. The
plots are well-fit to the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Figure 6a. Fitting with the
equivalent circuit yields the bulk resistance (Rb) and charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at different relative humidities, as shown in Table 1. The proton conductivity (through-plane)
was calculated using Rb, the electrode
area, and the membrane thickness. Figure 6b shows the proton conductivity and Rct as a function of RH. The proton conductivity
gradually increased with increasing RH, reaching 16 × 10–3 S cm–1 at 80% RH. Notably, the
proton conductivity was not lost when the GO membrane was under dry
conditions and showed almost constant values at 2–60% RH. The
GO membrane is an assembly of thin graphene nanosheets, and the sheets
are hydrophilic due to the presence of oxygen-containing functional
groups. Thus, water can be stably accommodated in the interlayer,
avoiding a drastic decrease in the proton conductivity. The results
confirm the good proton conductivity of the GO membrane even at low
humidity. In contrast, Rct largely increased
at low humidity. Such drastic increase in Rc likely impedes the electrochemical reaction at the TPI. Indeed,
the response was unstable under dry conditions, as shown above (Figure S3). Thus, the results suggest that electrochemical
reactions at the TPI are suppressed in dry air, leading to unstable
EMF response. On the other hand, the influence of humidity on the
response was not significant at 20–50% RH, as shown in Figure 5b. The good proton
conductivity and low Rct at 20–60
RH% may reduce the interference of humidity.

However, unstable EMF
responses were observed at 700–800
ppm H2, as shown in Figure S4. The response gradually decreased at higher hydrogen concentrations.
It is suggested that water accumulates as condensation from the gas
phase and by hydrogen combustion, blocking the TPI and decreasing
the response to hydrogen. Indeed, at lower H2 concentrations,
stable responses were observed. Such an adverse effect can be overcome
by controlling the microstructure of the electrode. Decreasing the
thickness or increasing the porosity of the electrode would avoid
the accumulation of byproducts at the TPI and produce stable responses.

Potentiometric and Amperometric Responses of the Planar-Type
GO Sensor
As shown above, our concentration cell-type sensor
works well as a hydrogen sensor. However, this structure is not practical
and difficult to downsize. To demonstrate the practical feasibility
of the GO sensor, a planar-type sensor was fabricated and tested for
its sensor response to hydrogen. Figure 7 shows the EMF response to hydrogen of the
planar-type GO sensor fitted with a perovskite-type oxide (La0.6Sr0.4Co0.78Ni0.02Fe0.2O3) as the counter electrode at room temperature.
The cobalt-based perovskite-type oxide is known to show a high electrochemical
oxygen reduction activity.43 In addition,
with this material, the operating temperature of a solid electrolyte
oxygen sensor can successfully be lowered.44 The sensor quickly responded to a change in the hydrogen concentration,
and the dependence of the sensor response (ΔEMF) was linearly
related to the logarithm of the hydrogen concentration. We confirmed
that the perovskite-type oxide is not sensitive to hydrogen at room
temperature using a concentration cell-type sensor with the air reference
electrode, as shown in Figure S5. The use
of materials inert to hydrogen for the counter electrode allows us
to measure a change in the sensing electrode potential using a planar-type
device. The observed stable response indicates that the potential
at the counter electrodes is fixed even when the hydrogen concentration
was changed. Thus, no efficient anodic oxidation of hydrogen was thought
to have occurred at the perovskite-type oxide/GO interface due to
its low catalytic activity at room temperature, fixing the counter
electrode potential almost
constant. On the other hand, the perovskite-type oxide has good oxygen
reduction activity,43 and as such, the
oxygen reaction (eq 6) can reach equilibrium to achieve stable EMF responses.

Figure 7 Hydrogen-sensing
properties of the planar-type GO sensor with the
Pt/C sensing electrode and perovskite-type oxide counter electrode
in air (35% RH) at room temperature.

The above results indicate that the potentiometric detection
of
hydrogen is possible with the planar-type sensor. However, accurate
concentration determination is sometimes difficult due to the semilogarithmic
dependence of EMF on the gas concentration. In contrast, for amperometric
detection, a linear dependence of the sensor signal on the concentration
can be obtained. Thus, we attempted to detect hydrogen by measuring
the electrical currents generated upon electrochemical reactions driven
by applied voltage. Figure 8 shows the change in the response of the planar GO sensor
with a perovskite-type oxide counter electrode and the dependence
of the electrical currents on hydrogen concentration. The electrical
currents were generated as a result of the anodic and cathodic reactions
(eqs 3 and 4). The obtained sensor response (ΔI) was linearly related to the hydrogen concentration, as expected.
Currently, more detailed assessments of the amperometric sensing properties,
such as the cross-sensitivity and stability, are in progress.

Figure 8 Current response
(ΔI) to hydrogen of the
planar-type GO sensor with a Pt/C sensing electrode and perovskite-type
oxide counter electrode in air (35% RH) at room temperature. The applied
voltage was 1.2 V. The inset shows the change in response.

This study clearly shows that both potentiometric
and amperometric
detection of hydrogen is possible with the planar GO sensor. One important
property of the GO membrane is its water-storing capability, which
allows protons to diffuse in the interlayer. This property can be
controlled by tuning the size of the GO nanosheets, the amount of
oxygen-containing functional groups, and the thickness of the membrane.
For gas detection, the reactivity of combustible gases, such as hydrogen
and CO, on the GO membrane is important. Tuning the catalytic activity
of the electrode improves aspects of the sensor performance such as
the sensitivity, selectivity, and stability. Further development of
the GO-based sensor is also feasible based on its excellent prospective
characteristics as a sensor material. The structure and composition
of GO can be facilely controlled by several routes, including the
hybridization of GO with noble metals, metal oxides, and molecular
catalysts; surface functionalization with organic compounds; and the
doping of foreign elements into the GO framework.45−47 Modification
by such methods would drastically change the catalytic and electrochemical
properties of the GO membrane, thereby improving the sensitivity,
selectivity, and stability of the GO sensor. Because GO itself is
a single-layer nanosheet, ultraminiaturization of the electrochemical
GO sensor is also possible, as was reported for ultrasmall graphene-based
transistor-type gas sensors.48

Conclusions
A colloidal suspension of GO nanosheets was synthesized by a modified
Hummers’ method starting from graphite powder. Filtration using
the colloidal suspension produced a self-standing GO membrane (180
μm) free of pinholes. Proton conduction in the GO membrane was
confirmed by hydrogen concentration cell measurements. Sensor devices
were fabricated by attaching Pt/C and Pt-black to the GO membrane
as sensing and reference electrodes, respectively. The sensor using
atmospheric air as a reference gas showed good EMF responses to hydrogen
(50–300 ppm) in air (35% RH) at room temperature. The EMF was
linearly related to the logarithm of the hydrogen concentration. The
slope of the curve was 3 times higher than that expected from the
Nernst equation, indicating that the generation of EMF upon the introduction
of hydrogen is explained in terms of the mixed-potential theory. The
sensor response was influenced by humidity, and no stable response
was observed under dry conditions. Complex impedance analyses suggest
that electrochemical reactions at the TPI are impeded in the absence
of water, causing the EMF response to be unstable. A planar-type sensor
was also fabricated using solid reference electrodes composed of a
perovskite-type oxide that is not sensitive to hydrogen. The planar
GO sensor also showed good EMF responses to hydrogen in air at room
temperature. Amperometric detection of hydrogen was also possible
using the planar-type sensor.
