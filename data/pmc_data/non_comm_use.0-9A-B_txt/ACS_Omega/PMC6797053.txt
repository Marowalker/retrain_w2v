Efficient
synthesis of valuable platform chemicals from renewable
feedstock is a challenging, yet essential strategy for developing
technologies that are both economical and sustainable. In the present
study, we investigated the synthesis of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid
(FDCA) in a two-step catalytic process starting from sucrose as largely
available biomass feedstock. In the first step, 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural
(HMF) was synthesized by hydrolysis and dehydration of sucrose using
sulfuric acid in a continuous reactor in 34% yield. In a second step,
the resulting reaction solution was directly oxidized to FDCA without
further purification over a Au/ZrO2 catalyst with 84% yield
(87% selectivity, batch process), corresponding to 29% overall yield
with respect to sucrose. This two-step process could afford the production
of pure FDCA after the respective extraction/crystallization despite
the impure intermediate HMF solution. To demonstrate the direct application
of the biomass-derived FDCA as monomer, the isolated product was used
for Ugi-multicomponent polymerizations, establishing a new application
possibility for FDCA. In the future, this efficient two-step process
strategy toward FDCA should be extended to further renewable feedstock.

1 Introduction
Diminishing
fossil resources in combination with an increasing
demand for chemical products necessitate the exploitation of sustainable
feedstock.1−4 Hence, the use of biomass as a renewable carbon source for the production
of chemicals represents a very active field of research.3,5,6 The partial decomposition of biomass
leads to so-called platform molecules that are suitable for subsequent
conversion into valuable products. One of the often considered versatile
platform molecules is 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF).3,7 HMF can be produced from hexoses and their polymers8 via acid-catalyzed dehydration in numerous solvents ranging
from aqueous, organic to biphasic solvent systems using both homogeneous
and heterogeneous catalysts.6,9 Dehydration of hexoses
in water using mineral acid catalysts is a promising approach for
HMF production because water is potentially a green solvent and both
the solvent and the catalysts are relatively cheap.10 Several strategies already reported on the further conversion
of HMF to valuable products include hydrogenation,11 dehydrogenation,12 or hydrodeoxygenation.13,14 One of the most promising products obtained by the selective oxidation
of HMF is 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), which is an alternative
to fossil-based monomers in future plastics, such as poly(ethylene
furanoate).15−18 HMF can be oxidized using bio-19,20 or electrocatalysts21,22 as well as homogeneous23,24 and heterogeneous metal
catalysts.18,25,26 Especially the heterogeneously catalyzed oxidation of HMF with oxygen
or air in water has gained increasing interest in the last years due
to substantial advantages, e.g., catalyst recovery and recyclability,
as well as due to sustainability considerations. Among others, gold
catalysts have been proven to be highly active in FDCA synthesis.27−32 However, when biomass or carbohydrates are used as feedstock for
the synthesis of HMF, impurities like humins are generated, lowering
the catalytic activity of further conversions.33,34 Therefore, most studies on FDCA synthesis report on the use of pure
HMF. This is far from efficient or sustainable because purification
of HMF is cost- and resource-intensive. Thus, the synthesis of FDCA
starting from biomass remains challenging. Only a few studies were
published for the synthesis of FDCA starting from mixtures directly
produced from biomass or carbohydrate hydrolysis.25,26 A loss of catalytic activity of the oxidation catalyst resulting
from contact with impurities can be circumvented by spatial separation
of the dehydration from the oxidation reaction, either by using multiphase
reactions35,36 or by two-step processes.33,37−44

In addition to its use as a substitute for terephthalic acid,
FDCA
may also be used as a monomer for other novel polymers. In this respect,
we investigated isocyanide-based multicomponent reactions (MCRs),
among which the Passerini three-component reaction45 and Ugi four-component reaction (Ugi-4CR)46,47 are particularly interesting in polymer science due to their versatility.48−53 For instance, the direct synthesis of polyamides54 and polyesteramides55 was achieved
via the Ugi reaction. More recently, isocyanide-based MCRs were used
for a variety of applications in polymer science ranging from monomer
synthesis56−60 to postpolymerization modification.56,61−64

In an ideal case of FDCA synthesis, the HMF obtained by biomass
hydrolysis should be directly oxidized and only then FDCA is purified
in the last step before polymerization. In the present study, the
whole process chain starting from sucrose hydrolysis and subsequent
dehydration to HMF and the final oxidation and polymerization steps
have been examined and are depicted in Scheme 1. Notably, sucrose is a relatively cheap
and widely available feedstock, also allowing the simulation of a
reaction solution obtained from cellulosic biomass with subsequent
isomerization of glucose. Therefore, this model feedstock can be substituted
at a later stage by cellulose or hemicellulose. In the next step,
unpurified HMF was directly oxidized with air over a 1.6 wt % Au/ZrO2 catalyst without any purification, but adjustment of pH.
Finally, FDCA was extracted, crystallized with sufficient purity,
and used as monomer for a multicomponent Ugi-4CR polymerization, a
novel application for FDCA.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Catalytic Synthesis of FDCA
The choice
of the feedstock is an essential aspect considering the scale as well
as the efficiency of processes based on renewable resources. In the
present study, HMF was produced from sucrose in a continuous tubular
reactor with sulfuric acid as the catalyst for hydrolysis as well
as dehydration.10 Glucose, fructose, xylose,
furfural, levulinic acid, formic acid, and uncharacterized polymeric
products were the main residues in solution. The selective oxidation
of HMF within this mixture was performed directly, i.e., without purification,
although side products originating from HMF production have been reported
to lower catalytic activities in further conversions.33,34 Hence, we used a highly active Au/ZrO2 catalyst prepared
by deposition–precipitation as oxidation catalyst32 and investigated suitable reaction conditions
by adding some of the known side products (Table 1).

a Reaction conditions:
125 °C,
10 bar air pressure, HMF/NaOH/sugars 1:4:1, 5 h reaction time, 1 mmol
HMF in 10 mL of H2O, 98 mg of catalyst (HMF/Au = 126 mol/mol).

b Conversion and yield were calculated
based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) calibrated
with external standards.

Since sugars were the main side products in the sucrose hydrolysis
and dehydration reaction, the influence of glucose and fructose on
the oxidation of pure HMF was first investigated. The results shown
in Table 1 reveal that
the presence of these sugars drastically decreases the yield of FDCA
and that similar amounts of intermediate 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic
acid (HFCA) (yield ∼35%) are obtained instead. The little amount
of FDCA that is produced is in the range of blank experiments. In
the next step, we tried to optimize the reaction conditions for HMF
oxidation in the presence of fructose.

To further understand
the catalytic system, additional parameters
were investigated. The influence of air pressure on the yield of FDCA
in the presence of fructose is shown in Figure 1a. Although the lower oxygen concentration
makes air a more demanding oxidant compared to pure oxygen, it was
used in this study to avoid hazardous reaction conditions and because
it is more sustainable.

Figure 1 (a) Influence of air pressure on the oxidation
of HMF in the presence
of fructose. Reaction conditions: 125 °C, HMF/NaOH/fructose 1:4:1,
5 h reaction time, 1 mmol HMF in 10 mL of H2O, 98 mg of
catalyst (HMF/Au = 126 mol/mol). (b) Influence of NaOH addition on
the oxidation of HMF in a solution directly produced from sucrose
over 1.6 wt % Au/ZrO2. Reaction conditions: 125 °C,
40 bar air pressure, 5 h reaction time, 0.3 mmol HMF in 10 mL of reaction
solution, 98 mg of catalyst (HMF/Au = 38 mol/mol).

We observed that increasing air pressure shows a positive
effect
on product yield. At lower air pressures (<30 bar air), mostly
the intermediate product HFCA is formed. Interestingly, the yield
of HFCA remains constant up to 30 bar, while the yield of FDCA increases.
The increasing carbon balance together with an increase in FDCA yield
to 72% at 40 bar shows that increasing air pressure facilitates HMF
oxidation. The literature mostly reports the oxidation of bio-based
HMF using pure O2 at elevated pressure.33,40,42,65 Since HMF
is unstable in basic aqueous solution, uncharacterized humins are
generated under such conditions, which is probably the reason for
carbon balances below 100%. Compared to our previous studies without
additional fructose,32 the negative influence
of fructose on the oxidation of HMF is obvious. Without additional
fructose, 76% FDCA was formed at 35 bar using one-third of the HMF-to-Au
molar ratio over the same Au/ZrO2 catalyst. Hence, more
catalyst needs to be used (i.e., lower HMF-to-metal ratios) when impure
HMF solutions are applied for FDCA synthesis.39−42 With a further increase in pressure
to 50 bar, a decrease in the FDCA yield was observed.

In the
next step, a sucrose hydrolysis/dehydration solution was
studied as a feedstock without intermediate purification. Besides
fructose and HMF, this solution contained some glucose and traces
of xylose, levulinic acid, and formic acid.10 Since these compounds commonly occur in the synthesis of HMF, our
results should be transferable to other biomass feedstock. Because
sulfuric acid was used as the dehydration catalyst, it had to be neutralized
before the oxidation reaction. For this purpose, a pH value of 7 was
adjusted using NaOH. Additionally, 4 equiv NaOH with respect to HMF
was added before the reaction. The reaction was carried out considering
the previously optimized reaction conditions (Figure 1a) in the presence of fructose. The HMF solutions
obtained from sucrose feedstock were less concentrated with 0.03 mol
L–1 of HMF. Nevertheless, the catalyst mass was
kept constant, resulting in a Au-to-HMF molar ratio of 38. HMF was
not fully converted, and HFCA was produced with 76% yield (81% selectivity)
as the main product (Figure 1b and Table S1). FDCA is produced
with 17% yield (18% selectivity). Considering the carbon balance with
respect to HMF, the process was very selective with almost no byproduct,
i.e., humin, formation. However, the selectivity toward FDCA needed
to be improved and thus the reaction conditions were further optimized.
As the process was very selective, the reaction time was prolonged
to 20 h in a first attempt (Table S1).
Although FDCA yield increased to 46% (50% selectivity), the carbon
balance decreased overall. Hence, the extended reaction time favors
undesired side reactions.

Next, the influence of base on the
reaction was investigated as
hydroxide ions are required for the oxidation of HMF.66 In addition, the presence of other functional groups due
to the contaminants might lead to a lower hydroxide-ions concentration.
Varying the amount of base under the same reaction conditions (Figure 1b), the conversion
of HMF increased to almost 100% with increase of excess base. Above
8 equiv NaOH (relative to HMF), a change in selectivity from HFCA
to FDCA was observed. In this case, FDCA was produced with 53% yield,
whereas 11% of HFCA was observed. Furthermore, increasing the amount
of base to 12 equiv led to a complete oxidation of HFCA to FDCA, resulting
in a yield of 84%. An even higher amount of base did not have any
further influence on the yield of FDCA, and the maximum yield seems
limited under the chosen reaction conditions. In addition to the yield
of FDCA, the selectivity of the reaction also increased to a maximum
of 87%.

The production of HFCA using impure HMF solutions can
be attributed
to the potential deposition of the present impurities on the catalyst
surface.37 In addition, the presence of
further oxidizable groups besides the ones of HMF may also be a reason
for this observation. In both cases, the active gold centers are blocked
lowering the catalytic activity. Therefore, humins are generated before
HMF is able to react on an active site of the catalyst.

Nevertheless,
a selective synthesis of FDCA was possible. The yield
of FDCA of 84% obtained under optimized conditions is high in view
of the fact that, in addition to HMF, many other undesirable substances
were present. As HMF extraction is necessary in other reports,33,37 this is a decisive innovative step forward in HMF oxidation. In
addition, we were able to establish a process in which, apart from
the addition of the catalyst and base, no further operations are required.
Therefore, we can directly use the resulting HMF solution since both
HMF synthesis and oxidation are performed in water and no solvent
mixture38,39 or multiphase setup35,36 is required, representing another innovation in the field of HMF
oxidation.

Possibly, also oxygen availability might be a limiting
factor in
this reaction since air was used instead of pure oxygen, generally
limiting its availability in solution. In addition, its adsorption
on the catalyst surface might be hindered by competitive adsorption
with the other components in solution. In fact, FDCA yield and, at
the same time, the carbon balance increased at higher pressure (Figure 1a) with a higher
availability of oxygen in solution.

Increasing the amount of
base in the oxidation of HMF produced
from sucrose from 4 to 8 equiv led to a decrease in the carbon balance.
The carbon balance increased again upon further increase in the amount
of base to 12 and 16 equiv. Since hydroxide ions contribute in the
catalytic cycle,66 increasing their amount
facilitates and accelerates the reaction. However, HMF is unstable
under basic conditions and thus the drop in selectivity at 8 equiv
might be explained by a faster degradation compared to the acceleration
in HMF oxidation.

The high yield of FDCA allowed its separation
from the reaction
solution, although side products from both HMF and FDCA synthesis
were present in solution. Acidification of the reaction solution with
HCl (pH 2), extraction using ethyl acetate, and evaporation of the
solvent led to a pure solid product of FDCA avoiding any chromatographic
or other purification steps. NMR spectroscopy showed solely the expected 1H NMR signals of FDCA, and gas chromatography analysis confirmed
a purity of 94% (Figure S1). Recrystallization
could be used for further purification.

2.2 Multicomponent
Polymerization of FDCA
As a third and final step after the
production of HMF and FDCA, we
investigated Ugi-multicomponent polymerizations, thus introducing
new application possibilities for FDCA. First, we optimized the reaction
conditions by varying the solvent and concentration of the components
using commercial FDCA (purity >95%), as shown in Table 2.

reaction was scaled up to 7.68
g theoretical yield of the polymer; average molecular weight after

As reported
previously, a different solvent mixture is beneficial
for this multicomponent polymerization due to differences in solubility
of the monomers and polymers, specific for each monomer combination
of bifunctional and monofunctional acids, amines, aldehydes, and isocyanides.67 Since tetrahydrofuran (THF) provides good solubility
for most polymers and methanol is a suitable protic solvent for Ugi
reactions, this combination was first evaluated. However, THF was
not beneficial here (Table 2, entry 1), as the major part of FDCA did not dissolve. To
provide a good solubility for the aromatic and polar FDCA, the ionic
liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([EMIM]BF4) was evaluated without co-solvent (Table 2, entry 2) and with methanol as co-solvent
(Table 2, entries 3–5).
A molecular weight of Mn = 5,450 g mol–1 (Đ = 1.88, Table 2, entry 4) was achieved. However,
various impurities were identified by 1H NMR spectroscopy,
which could not be separated by precipitation, indicating side reactions
during polymerization. In contrast, pure methanol led to a higher
molecular weight at the concentration of 0.5 mol L–1 (Mn = 6,700 g mol–1; Đ = 1.83, Table 2, entry 15) without any side reactions. A
further improvement was achieved using mixtures of methanol and dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) with the highest molecular weight at a ratio of MeOH/DMSO
1:3 (Table 2, entry
18). Interestingly, a higher concentration, which is usually beneficial
for polymer formation, led to a lower molecular weight for all evaluated
ratios of MeOH/DMSO as well as pure MeOH (Table 2, entries 6–13). Compared to commercial
FDCA, the FDCA catalytically synthesized from HMF as discussed above
(94% purity) yielded a only slightly lower molecular weight (Mn = 8,800 g mol–1; Đ = 2.01, Table 2, entry 18). After the optimization, the reaction was
scaled up. The polymer was further purified by precipitation in water
to separate DMSO and afterward in petrol ether at ca. −30 °C
to separate low-molecular-weight oligomers and macrocycles formed
due to the relatively high dilution (0.5 mol L–1). After precipitation, a molecular weight of Mn = 11,100 g mol–1 (Đ = 2.73, Table 2,
entry 19) was obtained. As the mixture is comparably diluted, in addition
to the high-molecular-weight polymer, significant amounts of twofold
and threefold macrocycles were formed, which is well known from the
literature68 and can also be exploited
to synthesize, e.g., polymacrocycles, in two steps (Figure 2, bottom).69

603.4481; fourfold macrocycle [M + H]+ (calculated): 1205.8887,
[M + H]+ (obtained): 1205.8888) and can be assigned in
the SEC trace (Figure 2, bottom) at retention times of 19.5 min (twofold macrocycle) and
18.3 min (fourfold macrocycle). Additionally, the twofold macrocycle
was isolated by column chromatography and again measured in SEC confirming
the peak assignment. The chemical structure of the polymer was confirmed
by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Figure 2) as well as correlation spectroscopy
and 1H–13C heteronuclear single quantum
coherence (HSQC) spectroscopy. Thermal analysis [differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC)] reveals a glass transition at 82.2 °C and
no melting point within the measured temperature range of −85
to 250 °C. Summarizing the polymerization results, catalytically
obtained FDCA is a suitable monomer for direct multicomponent polymerization,
resulting in novel polymer structures as well as interesting macrocyclic
products.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
a process chain is established herein based on HMF
produced from sucrose as an example for a mixture obtained from sugar-based
feedstock. The resulting HMF was directly and selectively oxidized
to FDCA without purification and, thus, despite the presence of impurities,
which represents a novelty in this field. After acidification and
extraction with ethyl acetate, FDCA was available in a purity that
allows polymerization. The purity can be increased by recrystallization.
As a demonstration example and to evaluate a new application possibility
for FDCA, the Ugi-4CR as novel process has been conducted using commercially
available FDCA and FDCA that was produced in the catalytic process.
Although FDCA could be produced in these preliminary studies in high
yield and purity, the sustainability of the process remains challenging
considering the 12 principles of green chemistry.70 Obviously, we were able to use a renewable feedstock and
nontoxic chemicals in FDCA synthesis, the reaction was heterogeneously
catalyzed in aqueous medium, and we could circumvent purification
after step 1. In addition, air was used as green oxidant. However,
to further optimize the sustainability, the use of base in FDCA synthesis
should be minimized by using a solid base or by recycling it. Furthermore,
it would be desirable to extend the process to other sugar-based feedstocks
and the polymerization should be further optimized with regard to
sustainability, for example, by changing the solvent mixtures.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
All
chemicals for the catalytic
synthesis of FDCA were of analytical grade and have been used without
further purification: HMF, FDCA (Sigma-Aldrich), HFCA, NaOH, sucrose
(Merck), 5-formyl-2-furoic acid, 2,5-diformylfurane (TCI Chemicals), d(−)-fructose, d(+)-glucose (VWR Chemicals),
HAuCl4·3H2O, H2SO4, ZrO2 1/8 in. pellets (Alfa Aesar) and synthetic air
(Air Liquide). All solvents applied in the multicomponent polymerization
of FDCA were used in HPLC grade. The following chemicals were used
as received: 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA, OXCHEM, >95%), 1,10-diaminodecane
(TCI, >98.0%), isobutyraldehyde (≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich), tert-butyl isocyanide (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%), and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
tetrafluoroborate ([EMIM]BF4, Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.0%).

4.2 Methods
The oxidation of HMF was
carried out in self-built stainless steel autoclaves (52 mL with Teflon
inlet, max. pressure of 200 bar at 350 °C, magnetically stirred
at maximum speed) equipped with heating sleeves, and the solutions
were analyzed via HPLC (Hitachi Primaide, Aminex HPX-87H column, solvent
5 mM H2SO4, 50 °C at 0.5 mL min–1, refractive index and diode array detectors). The 1H
NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a BRUKER Prodigy
spectrometer (operating at 400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C). Molecular weight distributions were determined using
an SEC system LC-20A from Shimadzu equipped with an SIL-20A autosampler
and an RID-10A refractive index detector in THF (flow rate, 1.0 mL
min–1) at 50 °C. IR spectra were recorded on
a BRUKER α-p instrument in the frequency range of 3997.41–373.828
cm–1 applying attenuated total reflection (ATR)
technology. DSC experiments were carried out with a DSC STARe system
(Mettler Toledo) operating under nitrogen atmosphere and employing
a sample mass of approximately 5.0 mg. The glass transition (Tg) was recorded on the second heating scan by
using the following method: cooling from room temperature to −85
°C, heating from −85 to 250 °C at 10 °C min–1, cooling from 250 to −85 °C at 10 °C
min–1, and heating from −85 to 250 °C
at 10 °C min–1. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC)
aluminum foils with fluorescence indicator from MERCK (TLC silica
gel 60, F254, layer thickness: 0.25 mm) were employed.
Size exclusion chromatography–electrospray ionization mass
spectrometry (SEC-ESI MS) was recorded on an LTQ Orbitrap XL Q Exactive
mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) equipped
with a HESI II probe.

4.3 Synthesis of HMF
The synthesis of
HMF was performed as described elsewhere.10 In brief, an aqueous solution of 2 wt % sucrose and 0.005 M sulfuric
acid was fed into a tubular reactor operating at 200 °C and 25
bar. The hydrodynamic residence time was 10 min. The resulting solution
from the reactor was cooled in a heat exchanger and stored at 4 °C.
A carbon balance showed that the carbon from the sucrose feedstock
was converted to 26.6% HMF, 48.6% glucose, 17.2% fructose, 1.4% levulinic
acid, 1.2% furfural, and 4.9% undefined side products.

4.4 Oxidation of HMF
The batchwise oxidation
of HMF was performed using a Au/ZrO2 catalyst prepared
by deposition–precipitation method.32 For more details on the preparation procedure and thorough catalyst
characterization, see ref (32). For testing the influence of carbohydrates on the FDCA
yield, 1 mmol (126 mg) HMF and an equimolar amount of glucose or fructose
were dissolved in water before the desired amount of NaOH was added
as a 2.5 M solution to give a total volume of 10 mL. For the oxidation
of HMF produced from sucrose, the resulting solutions from the continuous
HMF synthesis were brought to a pH of 7 prior to oxidation using NaOH.
The desired excess amount of NaOH was then added to 10 mL of this
solution. In both cases, the solid catalyst was then added, the reactors
were closed, purged three times with synthetic air, and pressurized
to a desired value. The point of first reaching the desired reaction
temperature was set as the starting point of the reaction (t = 0, ca. 15 min). The reactors were cooled to room temperature
in an ice bath after the reaction, depressurized, and the solid catalyst
was separated from the solutions by decantation. Samples before and
after reaction were taken, filtered with a 0.45 μm Pall Teflon
filter, and diluted for HPLC analysis. The HPLC was calibrated using
solutions with different concentrations of HMF, HFCA, FDCA, 2,5-diformylfuran,
and 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid.

4.5 Optimization
of the Ugi-4C Polymerization
Decane-1,10-diamine (221 mg,
1.28 mmol, 1.00 equiv) was dissolved
in the respective solvent mixture (2.56 mL total volume for 0.5 M,
1.28 mL total volume for 1 M, 0.64 mL total volume for 2 M). Isobutyraldehyde
(351 μL, 277 mg, 3.84 mmol, 3.00 equiv) was added, and the mixture
was stirred for 30 min at room temperature to preform the imine. Furan-2,5-dicarboxylic
acid (200 mg, 1.28 mmol, 1.00 equiv) was suspended in the mixture
and tert-butyl isocyanide (435 μL, 320 mg,
3.84 mmol, 3.00 equiv) was added. After stirring at 500 rpm for 3
days, the mixture was precipitated in water to separate the high-boiling
solvents, yielding a sticky polymer, which was dried in vacuo before
GPC analysis.

4.6 Optimized Polymerization
and Scale-Up
Decane-1,10-diamine (2.21 g, 12.8 mmol, 1.00
equiv) was dissolved
in a mixture of 19.2 mL of DMSO and 6.4 mL of methanol. Isobutyraldehyde
(3.51 mL, 2.77 g, 38.4 mmol, 3.00 equiv) was added, and the mixture
was stirred for 30 min at room temperature to preform the imine. Furan-2,5-dicarboxylic
acid (2.00 g, 12.8 mmol, 1.00 equiv) was suspended in the mixture,
and tert-butyl isocyanide (4.35 mL, 3.20 g, 38.4
mmol, 3.00 equiv) was added. After stirring at 500 rpm for 3 days,
the mixture was precipitated in water, yielding a sticky polymer.
The crude polymer was dissolved in acetone and precipitated in petrol
ether to separate the macrocycle and low-molecular-weight oligomers,
yielding a slightly yellow voluminous polymer (5.77 g, 75%) after
drying.
