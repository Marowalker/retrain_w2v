Silkworm
silk has become increasingly relevant for material applications.
However, the industry as a whole is retracting because of problems
with mass production. One of the key problems is the inconsistent
properties of the silk. A means by which to improve the silk material
properties is through enhanced sericulture techniques. One possible
technique is altering the feed of the silkworms to include single-wall
carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) or graphene (GR). Recently published results
have demonstrated substantial improvement in fiber mechanical properties.
However, the effect of the surfactant used to incorporate those materials
into the feed on the fiber mechanical properties in comparison to
normal silkworm silk has not been studied or reported. Thus, the total
effect of feeding the SWNT and GR in the presence of surfactants on
silkworms is not understood. Our study focuses on the surfactant [calcium
lignosulfonate (LGS)] and demonstrates that it alone results in appreciable
improvement of mechanical properties in comparison to nontreated silkworm
silk. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that mixing the LGS, SWNT,
and GR directly into the artificial diet of silkworms yields improved
mechanical properties without decline below the control silk at high
doses of SWNT or GR. Combined, we present evidence that mixing surfactants,
in this case LGS, directly with the diet of silkworms creates a high-quality
fiber product that can exceed 1 GPa in tensile strength. With the
addition of nanocarbons, either SWNT or GR, the improvement is even
greater and consistently surpasses control fibers. However, feeding
LGS alone is a more economical and practical choice to consistently
improve the mechanical properties of silkworm fiber.

Introduction
Silkworm silk has been
a highly utilized material, but its prevalence
is declining for a variety of reasons. Primarily, the fragmented and
varied nature of producing silkworm silk results in a wide variation
of mechanical properties.1−4 The demand for high-performance silkworm fibers has
led to efforts to improve sericulture techniques which, in turn, can
improve fiber mechanical properties and consistency.2,5,6 Investigations have studied altered
diets to affect fiber color and other physical fiber properties, which
have clearly demonstrated that silkworms can incorporate compounds
introduced during feeding directly into their fibers.7−14 More recent modifications have utilized the incorporation of single-wall
carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) or graphene (GR) into the silk to improve
the mechanical properties of the silkworm silk.15,16 These reported results have been remarkable. However, the studies
do not completely elucidate the causative agents for the observed
improvement, and the role of the surfactant, calcium lignosulfonate
(LGS), used to disperse the SWNT and GR is not understood.15,17

Our research clarifies the effect of feeding LGS, SWNT with
LGS,
and GR with LGS to silkworms, and how these additives alter the protein
structures and resultant final mechanical properties of the fibers.
LGS is an abundant anionic detergent that is nontoxic. In previous
publications, an important control was omitted to determine whether
improved fiber mechanical properties is due, in part or completely,
to the surfactant as opposed to the SWNT and GR.15 The mechanical properties of the reported control silk
(normal silkworms fed only mulberry leaves sprayed with LGS) underperformed
to what is typically observed for normal silkworm silk.1,15,18−20 Thus, the effect
of the surfactant in the feed of the control silk (according to the
authors, a normal silk control was not run) could impact the effect
that feeding SWNT and GR plus surfactant on the materials properties
of the silk fibers. Specifically, this research aims to discover the
role of the surfactant alone as it relates to fiber mechanical properties.
Additionally, we seek to demonstrate an alternative, scalable approach
to feeding LGS, SWNT, and GR to silkworms and ultimately validate
the improvements seen in other studies through the addition of SWNT
and GR while starting with high-performance silkworm silk.

Properties
Compiled mechanical results are
presented in Table 1, and representative stress–strain curves are presented in Figure 1. A control silkworm
silk demonstrated average mechanical properties of 0.75 GPa tensile
strength, 0.31 mm/mm strain, 6.2 GPa elastic modulus, and 163 MJ/m3 toughness. Every treatment group saw an increase in average
maximum tensile strength with the GR–0.2LGS and SWNT–0.2LGS
treatment groups showing the greatest improvement of all (1.21 and
1.35 GPa, respectively). Average strain at fracture did not vary significantly
between the treatment groups and the control group (Table 1, Figures 1 and S1).

Every treatment group saw an
increased average elastic modulus
when compared to the control (6.2 GPa) group (Table 1D). The SWNT–0.2LGS treatment group
showed the most improvement with an average elastic modulus of 13.44
GPa, which was double the elastic modulus of the control group. The
average toughness values (Table 1C) demonstrated increases for all treatment groups
with the smallest increase in the GR–1LGS treatment group (180.58
MJ/m3). The highest performing group, for average energy-to-break,
was the SWNT–0.2LGS treatment group which was more than doubled
the energy-to-break of control silk from 163 to 333.76 MJ/m3. The LGS group saw an increase of 34.9% in tensile strength (Table 1A), only a small change
in strain of 3.2% (Table 1B), a 34.1% increase in toughness (Table 1C), and an 81.5% increase in elastic modulus
(Table 1D) compared
to the control of normal silkworm silk. Of particular note is that
the LGS group matched, or surpassed, the 1 GPa threshold for tensile
strength on average.

Overall, as shown in Table 1, increased values were produced for nearly
all mechanical
properties of the treatment groups when compared to the control silk,
except for the maximum strains of both GR groups. Comparing the control
and the best-performing treatment groups, the GR–0.2LGS had
increases of 63.5 and 61.1% in toughness and tensile strength, respectively.
The SWNT–0.2LGS had increases of 104.7 and 79.0% in toughness
and tensile strength, respectively. However, when making the same
comparison with GR, the GR–0.2LGS decreased by 1.2% in strain,
whereas the SWNT–0.2LGS had an increase of 13.6%.

When
the mechanical properties are compared between groups that
all contained LGS, using the LGS-only group as the new control, differences
were still observed. The GR–0.2LGS has increases of only 21.9
and 19.4% in toughness and tensile strength, respectively. The SWNT–0.2LGS
showed a 52.7% increase in toughness and an increase in tensile strength
of 32.7%. The GR–0.2LGS had a decrease in strain of 3.1%, compared
to the LGS-only group, whereas the SWNT–0.2LGS had an increase
of 12.5%.

Fourier Transform Infrared–Attenuated Total Reflectance
Characterization
Structural characterization of the fibers
from each treatment group revealed noticeable structural changes to
the proteins that could potentially lead to the improved mechanical
performance observed between the treatment groups and the control
(Figure S2). Deconvolution of Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra (Figures 2 and S2) revealed that the
control silk had a percentage of β-sheets at 44% and α-helices/random
coil at 56%, similar to that reported in the literature.21−23 The addition of LGS to the diet alone increased the β-sheet
content to 71%. The GR–0.2LGS diet resulted in silk with 50%
β-sheet content, the GR–1LGS diet in fibers with 29%
β-sheet content, the SWNT–0.2LGS diet in fibers with
67% β-sheet content, and the SWNT–1LGS in fibers with
44% β-sheet content. The structural differences between the
fibers of each group also suggest that the natural protein organization
and structures are altered with the incorporation of the LGS, GR,
or SWNT.

and α-helix/random coil content of each fiber group as determined

Microscopy Fiber Analysis
Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) revealed no notable morphological differences or features between
fibers of the various treatment groups, as demonstrated in Figure 3. Standard optical
bright-field observation also revealed no obvious morphological differences
between treatment groups (Figure S3).

Discussion
This study demonstrates
that the consumption of LGS (anionic surfactant)
by silkworms results in the appreciable improvement of the mechanical
properties of the silk fibers (34.9% increase in tensile strength,
3.2% increase in strain, 34.1% increase in toughness, and 81.5% increase
in elastic modulus). The increase is not as great as when SWNT or
GR, at the 0.2 g level, is included with the LGS. However, given the
very high cost of feeding either SWNT or GR in large-scale sericulture,
the addition of LGS, and possibly other surfactants, represents a
more practical means to improve fiber mechanical properties and presents
an approach that warrants further exploration. The resulting LGS-only-treated
silkworms produced silk fibers exceeding 1 GPa on average for ultimate
tensile strength when starting with the high-quality Haoyue strain
of silkworms. Additionally, our results indicated that the LGS, SWNT,
and GR can be mixed into the feed rather than the intensive spraying
method previously reported with similar levels of improvement.15

This study further confirms that the mechanical
properties of silkworm
silk can also be substantially improved through the feeding of SWNT
and GR. In a previous study, the best fibers produced from the incorporation
of nanocarbons had strain increases of 10.0% (0.10 mm/mm) for GR and
34.1% (0.13 mm/mm) for SWNT when compared to the controls of 0.94
mm/mm.15 The largest increases in the tensile
strengths of the treated fibers from the controls, with an average
value of 360 MPa, were 58.3% (570 MPa) for GR and 63% (590 MPa) for
SWNT. Finally, the energy-to-break values of the fibers were also
improved 67.6% (38.04 MJ/m3) for GR and 112.5% (MJ/m3) for SWNT in comparison to the control silk of 22.7 MJ/m3. These improvements brought the very best group to a tensile
strength of 590 MPa, a strain of 0.13 mm/mm, and a toughness of 48.2
MJ/m3. By starting with a higher quality of silk, our methods
produced silk fibers that, in our best groups, had an average tensile
strength of 1345.5 MPa, a strain of 0.36 mm/mm, an elastic modulus
of 13.44 GPa, and a toughness of 333.8 MJ/m3. These values
approach or surpass the average mechanical properties of native spider
silk fibers (Table S1). The groups with
lower nanocarbon concentrations, SWNT–0.2LGS and GR–0.2LGS,
exhibited the largest overall increases and highest final properties.
Although the groups with higher nanocarbon concentrations (SWNT–1LGS
and GR–1LGS) still surpassed the values of the control silk,
the final properties were similar to those of that treated solely
with LGS.

Although substantial increases in the final properties
of the fibers
occurred with the addition of SWNT and GR, this trend did not continue
with the higher 1.0 g levels of nanocarbons. Overall, these fibers
still had enhanced abilities when compared to the nontreated controls
and were equivalent to the LGS-treated fibers, but more importantly
the fibers with higher amounts (1 g) of SWNT and GR underperformed
compared to fibers produced from lower nanocarbon amounts (0.2 g)
(Figure 1 and Table 1). This same negative
effect, from increased nanocarbon additives, was also observed in
the previously reported work, but with more drastic effects; the fibers
produced from feeding higher amounts of SWNT and GR all suffered severely
reduced properties that fell well under the control group (LGS for
that study).15 Whereas the properties for
the SWNT–1LGS and GR–1LGS in this study were similar
to the LGS group and still above the control fibers. This feeding
method may partially mitigate the negative effects of the higher amounts
(1 g) of SWNT and GR in the feed. This potentially prevents the silkworms
from the overconsumption of SWNT or GR and thus, incorporating too
much into their silk that can result in the nanocarbons acting as
imperfections rather than improving fiber performance. As previously
mentioned though, the benefits of simply introducing a surfactant
into the feed seem a more practical approach for enhancing fiber properties,
especially when higher concentrations of SWNT or GR are used.

The β-sheet content of the LGS treatment group alone was
higher than the β-sheet content of the control group validating
the increase of mechanical properties obtained with just the surfactant
LGS. Interestingly, the greatest increase in β-sheet content
was in the LGS-only group in comparison to the control. However, the
mechanical properties of the LGS-only group were lower than both the
GR–0.2LGS and SWNT–0.2LGS groups, even though the β-sheet
content for these groups was lower than the LGS group. The β-sheet
composition of the SWNT–1LGS and GR–1LGS groups was
equivalent or lower than the control fibers and the 0.2 g nanocarbon
treatments. Clearly, the content of β-sheets present within
the fibers is not solely responsible for the mechanical properties
of the silk; the arrangement of these structures within the fiber
is also a factor. The lower β-sheet content of the 1 g treatments
compared to the 0.2 g treatments indicates that the GR or SWNT at
the higher doses is acting as imperfections disrupting the formation
of β-sheets and their organization within the fiber. Even though
the 0.2 g treatments have lower β-sheet content, the average
mechanical properties exceed that of the LGS-alone group. The comparison
of mechanical properties and structural characteristics indicates
that the additions of GR and SWNT do indeed reinforce the fibers produced
by the silkworms. However, the addition of SWNT and GR is not necessary
to improve the abilities of native silkworm silk. Thus, LGS represents
a scalable and economical alternative to enhance fiber mechanical
properties through protein structure manipulation.

Neither bright-field
microscopy nor SEM revealed changes to the
appearance of the fibers. Degummed fibers from all of the groups appeared
smooth without obvious imperfections or surface artifacts. This clearly
suggests that the incorporation of LGS, SWNT, and GR into the feed
does not have a detrimental effect on the traits or qualities of the
fibers. However, at the 1 g dose of both GR and SWNT (GR–1LGS
and SWNT–1LGS), the silkworms did not appear to be as healthy
as the lower dosages of 0.2 g (GR–0.2LGS and SWNT–0.2LGS).
Silkworms in the low dosage groups were slightly smaller in size and
lethargic, whereas the high dosage groups appeared weaker and also
had a higher mortality rate compared to the controls. Overall, there
were no noticeable morphological differences in the final cocoons
produced by the silkworms (Figure S4).

Clearly, the enrichment of silkworm feed with nanocarbons has a
beneficial outcome on the final fibers. However, there are large differences
between the final values reported in this study and those previously
reported. This could partly be due to the higher performing silkworms
and their fibers as the starting point for improvement. Additional
factors that cannot be ruled out given the direct impact they can
have on cocoons, and ultimately fiber properties are feeding methods,
differences in sericulture conditions, silk harvesting and processing
techniques, and testing parameters.2,12,15,24,25 All of these could potentially be future areas of investigation,
with surfactant and nanocarbon additives, to further improve the consistency
and properties of silkworm fibers. For example, testing speeds have
an obvious influence on the mechanical properties. Generally, increasing
the strain rate improves fiber and polymer mechanical characteristics.26−29 Furthermore, higher test speeds are more representative of practical
rates of strain that materials are subjected to. As a means of comparison,
the control silk in this study was tested at 1 mm/min as was previously
reported by Wang et al. The control silk tested at 1 mm/min had a tensile strength of 502.7
MPa but when tested at 500 mm/min had a strength of 751.7 MPa.

In previous publications, the presence of GR and SWNT was confirmed
in the silk of the silkworms and even the excrement of the silkworms.15,30 The surfactant is much more difficult to assess whether it is present
within the fiber. Further work will confirm the presence of the surfactant.
Our study does not elucidate the uptake mechanism, incorporation,
or presence of the LGS into the fiber. It is possible that the surfactant
could act to improve gut permeability and increase nutritional support
to the silkworm thus improving fiber mechanical properties.

Conclusions
Our study demonstrated that the addition of LGS (an anionic surfactant)
to the feed of silkworms improves the mechanical properties of the
resulting fibers to near native spider silk values. The designation
of the silkworm fibers as spider silk-like was supported and validated
through the testing of native spider silk fibers, as reported in Table S1. This study also confirms that feeding
low doses of nanocarbons with the surfactant (0.2 g of GR and SWNT),
when starting with a high-quality silkworm strain, can substantially
improve the mechanical performance of the fibers to native spider
silk mechanical levels.20,31,32 Additionally, it has been demonstrated through this study that the
GR and SWNT can be mixed into the feed with relative ease and precision
to achieve marked improvement in fiber mechanical properties. This
method appears to reduce the negative effect on the mechanical properties
when feeding higher amounts of SWNT and GR than previously reported.15

Materials and Methods
Feed Preparation and Feeding
Procedures
A purebred
strain of silkworms (Haoyue) with white cocoons was used for this
study. A commercial silkworm powdered chow diet was obtained from
Mulberry Farms (Fallbrook, CA, USA). The feedstock was prepared according
to the manufacturer’s directions. SWNTs, with an average diameter
of 1.1 nm and length of 5–30 μm (US4110, US Research
Nanomaterials, Houston, TX, USA), and Graphene, with average particle
size <50 nm and specific surface area of 30–50 m2/g (BST-Nano, San Diego, CA, USA), were added to the chow in the
amounts listed in Table 2 and in the same ratios reported in a previous study.15 In order to assure complete and homogeneous
mixing of the LGS, SWNT, and GR additives, they were added as dry
powders to the dry silkworm chow and thoroughly mixed by hand. Water
was then added, and the combinations were thoroughly mixed again.
The wet chow was placed in a microwave for heating to prepare the
final feedstock. Food was administered to the worms at a consistent
level by weighing prior to feeding, thus ensuring that one group was
not fed more than others. A conventional pasta maker was utilized
to shape the feed uniformly into pasta-like ribbons to ensure even
distribution of feed. Feed was not limited. Feeding SWNT and GR enriched
silkworm chow commenced at the beginning of the third instar with
each group of silkworms containing 10 individuals, similar to previously
reported methods.15

Table 2 Feed Specifications and Ratios for
the Quantities of LGS, GR, and SWNT Prepared for Each Specific Experimental
Group

 	 	 	1	GR–1LGS	
SWNT	 	 	0.2	SWNT–0.2LGS	
 	 	 	1	SWNT–1LGS	
The silkworm chow for each
group was replaced every one to two
days, as needed. Worms were allowed to develop to the end of the fifth
instar at which point they were transferred to rolled paper tubes
measuring 30 mm in diameter and 225 mm in length to spin their cocoons,
with three worms in each tube. Both ends of the tubes were secured
after placing the silkworms in it to prevent escape and to promote
successful cocoon formation. At completion of cocoon spinning, the
tubes were opened and cocoons retrieved.

Fiber Degumming
After cocoon production, the cocoons
were cut open with a small blade at one end and the pupae were removed.
Segments from each cocoon were gently removed by cutting. A degumming
(sericin removal) solution was prepared with 0.25% (w/v) Na2CO3 in water. Each cocoon thread segment was placed with
80 mL of the degumming solution in a 100 mL glass bottle. The bottles
were placed in a water bath at 85 °C and mixed constantly until
the sericin was dissolved, indicated by the silk becoming more transparent
and separating into a cloud-like shape. The silk was collected from
the bottles and rinsed in water before air drying at room temperature
on a flat surface to form a silk mat. Individual fiber segments were
taken from each mat without pulling or stretching the fibers to preserve
mechanical properties for mechanical testing.

Preparation and Mechanical
Testing of Fibers
At the
completion of silk degumming, rinsing, and drying, individual fibers
were mounted on plastic film “C” shaped cards across
a precut opening with a gauge length of 19.05 mm.33 Three cocoons from each group were used for mechanical
testing with three fibers from each cocoon. The fibers were then secured
with cyanoacrylate glue at both ends of the fiber to the “C”
card. Fiber diameters were measured using the Motic Image Plus 2.0
program and a Motic BA310 microscope at nine individual points along
the 19.05 mm length.

Reported diameters are considered an average
diameter. Silkworm fibers are composed of two fibers; thus, their
“diameter” varies depending on the angle that the fiber
is viewed with one angle showing essentially the width of a single
fiber and the other showing the width of two fibers. The fiber(s)
are twisted as a result of production by the silkworm. It is difficult,
if not impossible, to scan the fiber under high magnification and
determine where the twists start and stop, making diameter measurements
less precise.24 Therefore, the most efficient
method to measure diameters is to simply scan the fiber for the thinnest
sections ensuring a consistent measurement. There is no formalized
or consistent means by which to efficiently and accurately overcome
these basic obstacles in fiber cross-sectional measurements, and many
of the silk mechanical properties reported in the literature have
unclear, or completely omit, methods for determining the sample cross-sectional
areas.3,15,30,34−37 However, all fibers reported in this study were measured
and treated equally using the method described above.

Fibers
were tested with environmental conditions of 22 °C
and 40% humidity on a MTS Synergie 100 instrument, with a custom 10
g load cell, to measure the uniaxial tensile mechanical properties
at 500 mm/min. Additionally, our control silk was also tested at 1
mm/min for comparison to Wang et al. where test speeds were reported
at 1 mm/min (Table S2). The data gathered
were then exported as a .txt file and imported into Microsoft Excel
to further determine and calculate the mechanical properties of the
fibers and the effects of the individual treatment groups.

SEM Morphological
Analysis
Morphological analysis of
the fibers was performed with a Quanta FEG 650 field emission scanning
electron microscope. Three fiber samples from each treat group were
randomly collected from the degummed fiber mats. All of the fibers
were then stretched out and mounted on a carbon tape with all fibers
parallel to each other. The prepared sample holders and the samples
were then sputter coated with a 10 nm layer of Au/Pd. Imaging of the
sample was performed in high vacuum mode at 1.22 mPa and collected
with an Everhart-Thornley detector. Images were taken at 2500×
and 7500× magnifications with a beam energy of 20 kV, a spot
size of 2, and a dwell time of 15 μs.

Spectroscopic Structural
Characterization
The protein
structures of the silkworm fibers were probed with Raman and FTIR
spectroscopy. A Varian 660-IR instrument with a horizontal attenuated
total reflectance (ATR) attachment was used for the FTIR spectroscopy.
Background scans were obtained prior to the sample measurements. Fiber
mats from each treatment were placed directly on the ATR crystal and
clamped, and measurements were performed using the data acquisition
software Resolution Pro Version. Each mat was measured multiple times
with each measurement having the following parameters: an aperture
setting of 4 cm–1 at 4000 cm–1, a resolution of 1 cm–1, and 32 scans over the
range of 600–4000 cm–1. Deconvolution of
the obtained FTIR spectra was performed with Origin data analysis
software using a method previously reported by Hu et al.38 Minor differences in the method consisted of
the use of a Gaussian fit and Origin instead of Opus 5.0. In brief,
a nine-point Savitsky–Golay smoothing filter was applied with
a 0.3 ratio; the fraction of the interferogram to which the apodization
and deconvolution were applied. The assignments of vibrational bands
previously used by Guo et al. were utilized for this analysis.39 The Gaussian line profiles were fit through
a three-step process as follows: fixing the number and position of
bands, allowing the band positions to shift in accordance with the
Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm, and finally adjusting the overall
fitted curve with a nonlinear least-squared method to obtain a fit
as near to the original spectra as possible. The areas of the resultant
bands were analyzed to determine the secondary protein structure contents
within the fibers for the amide I region.

A Renishaw inVia Raman
microscope with a 633 nm HeNe laser was used for the Raman spectroscopy.
Bundles of fibers were stretched across an aluminum tape on a glass
slide and then secured at both ends. Spectral acquisitions were obtained
with RenishawWire 4.1 after the bundles were focused with the 20×
objective. Each bundle was measured multiple times with each acquisition
having the following parameters: an exposure time of 60 s at 100%
laser power, a range from 200 to 3200 cm–1, with
a total of 5 accumulations. Finally, after completing the spectral
acquisition, the background was subtracted for each measurement.
