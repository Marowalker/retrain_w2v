A glutathione
reductase (GSHR)-like enzyme in Pseudomonas
moraviensis stanleyae was previously implicated as
underlying the bacterium’s remarkable SeO32– tolerance. Herein, this enzyme is sequenced, recombinantly expressed,
and fully characterized. The enzyme is highly adapted for selenodiglutathione
substrates (Km = 336 μM) compared
to oxidized glutathione (Km = 8.22 mM).
The recombinant expression of this enzyme in the laboratory strains
of Escherichia coli conveys a 10-fold
increase in IC90 for SeO32–. Moreover, selenium nanoparticles are observed when the enzyme is
overexpressed in the cells exposed to SeO32–, but not in the corresponding no-enzyme controls. The analyses of
the structural homology models of the enzyme reveal changes in the
parts of the enzyme associated with product release, which may underlie
the Se substrate specialization. Combined, the observations of adaptation
to Se reduction over oxidized glutathione reduction as well as the
portability of this nanoparticle-mediated SeO32– tolerance into other cell lines suggest that the P. moraviensis GSHR may be better described as a
GSHR-like metalloid reductase.

Introduction
The enzymatic conversion
of soluble inorganic ions into insoluble
forms is accomplished by enzyme centers such as those found in ferritin,
magnetosomes, and silicateins. This enzymatic alteration in the solubility
state facilitates the synthesis of biogenic inorganic materials.1−3 These naturally occurring catalysts, in concert with accessory proteins,
can exhibit control over subsequent material composition, oxidation
state, morphology, and structure. These natural precedents suggest
that the intentional engineering of biological diversity could underlie
the engineered diversity in biogenically synthesized inorganic materials.
Such inorganic materials—synthesized by laboratory-evolved
or engineered biomolecules (peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids)
attract attention in catalysis, self-assembly, and in biocontrast
(labeling) applications.4−8

Many self-contained biological systems, for synthesizing an
inorganic
nanostructure, will generally require an oxidoreductase activity,
enabling the conversion of inorganic ions from soluble to insoluble
oxidation states. Ferritins and DNA-binding proteins accomplish this
with the ferroxidase enzymatic centers.9,10 Mercuric reductases
accomplish this with substrate reduction through an active dithiol,11 which exhibits striking similarities to other
enzymes such as lipoamide dehydrogenase.12

We recently reported on the ability of glutathione reductase
(GSHR)
to enzymatically reduce selenite (SeO32–) to zerovalent red selenium in a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADPH)-dependent reaction.13 Similar, although diminished, activity was observed for the same
enzyme in reducing tellurite (TeO32–)
to elemental Te. Our prior work identified the selenite reductase
activity in Pseudomonas moravenis stanleyae.
This microbe attracted our attention because it is found as an endophyte
in the selenium-tolerant plant, Stanleya pinnata. When cultured independently in liquid media, it tolerates SeO32– supplementation in liquid culture up
to 10 mM. This is 10-fold more than the SeO32– tolerance of most other microbes. We attributed the observed selenite
reduction activity of P. moravenis to
a GSHR-like enzyme on the basis of proteomic mass spectrometry of
an in-gel in situ selenium reductase activity.

GSHRs generally
belong to the family of pyridine nucleoside-dependent
oxidoreductases. This enzyme family also, notably, includes another
well-characterized metal-reducing enzyme—mercuric reductase.14 Within this enzyme family, the active sites
are highly conserved. The typical active site peptide sequences are
CXXXXC for type I and CXXC for type II enzymes.15 These classes of enzymes have demonstrated their ability
to reduce a variety of metal ions to zerovalent forms, including Se,
Hg, Te, Fe, Cr, and U.16−19 GSHR is reported to reduce Au(III) to the zerovalent form as well.20 Thus, the class of pyridine nucleoside-dependent
oxidoreductases may represent an evolutionarily adaptable platform
of inorganic ion reductases, with modifications to the enzyme, altering
the metal-ion selectivity. Such a catalytic center, with alterable
precursor selectivity, is of interest in biogenic inorganic nanoparticle
(NP) synthesis.

In a prior study, we characterized the commercially
sourced Saccharomyces cervisiae GSHR
for selenite reductase
activity, showing the ability of the enzyme to oxidize NADPH while
reducing SeO32– to Se(0) NPs.13 In the present study, we characterize a homologous
metalloid reductase from the seleno-specialist P. moraviensis. We find that the substrate selectivity of the metalloid reductase
(Km) shows a substantially larger preference
for GS-Se-SG relative to all other reported GSHR enzymes. These enzymatic
properties can be partially rationalized in terms of sequence and
the corresponding homology-modeled structure of the enzyme. We also
observe that expressing this enzyme in the laboratory strains of E. coli (BL21, SS320) results in an increased tolerance
to SeO32–, as well as the presence of
Se NPs in these cells. Overall, our data suggest that the enzyme may
be best described as a GSHR-like metalloid reductase (GRLMR).

Results
and Discussion
The altered substrate specificity of GRLMR
enzymes, favoring selenodiglutathione
(GS-Se-SG) over oxidized glutathione (GSSG) as a substrate, could
underlie the remarkable SeO32– tolerance
of P. moravenis stanleyae. We therefore
characterized the P. moravenis stanleyae
GRLMR enzyme identified previously. The DNA sequence of the enzyme
was acquired through a full-genome sequencing (ACGT Inc., Wheeling,
IL). The sequencing was conducted using de novo paired-end sequencing.21 This revealed a genome in which 70.3% of the
nucleobases have, at the most, a 1:1000 probability of misassignment. Figure S1 shows the “Quality Score”
(Q score) for each sequenced base with Q = −log 10(e). The Q scores are derived from
a phred-like error probability assessment of each individual nucleotide.22

A basic local alignment search tool search
of the genomic sequence,
using the Pseudomonas R-28S GSHR as
a reference, identified one GSHR-like sequence, with 93% sequence
homology. The sequence alignment of this GRLMR DNA using Serial Cloner
shows a high similarity (98.00%) to Pseudomonas fluorescines GSHR and modest similarity (67–71%) to Escherichia
coli, Stanleya cervisiae, and Homo sapiens GSHR DNA. The sequence
similarities are summarized in Table 1, and full alignments are shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S2. The DNA sequence,
combined with the homology modeling of the structure, suggests that
all of the structural domains of type I pyridine nucleotide-dependent
oxidoreductases, including catalysis, dimerization, nucleotide binding,
and substrate/product-binding domains,15,23,24 are present in this enzyme. Such a homology would
suggest that the GRLMR enzyme would conduct substrate reduction for
GSSG, and related molecules, in a fashion similar to previously reported
GSHR reduction pathways via an active-site dithiol.25,26 This GRLMR shows 19% DNA sequence homology to mercuric reductase
from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Homology modeling using
intensive parameters on the Phyre 2 server27 suggests that the structures of the Pseudomonas-derived GSHR and GRLMR enzymes are homologous
to the other GSHR enzymes, despite modest DNA sequence divergence. Table 1 shows the root-mean-square
deviation (RMSD) of the atomic position values for a set of GSHR homology
models and/or crystal structures. Overall, the RMSD values for these
structures are similar, suggesting an overall structural homology
between GRLMR, and GSHR from P. fluorescines, E. coli, H. sapiens, and S. cervisiae.

Under the
hypothesis that the GRLMR enzyme has altered selectivity
relative to other characterized GSHRs, we characterized the enzyme
kinetics of both GRLMR and S. cervisiae GSHR. We expressed GRLMR recombinantly in the E.
coli BL21 cells. Following a 6×-histidine tag
purification, we determined the Michaelis–Menton constants
(Km) for both GRLMR and the commercially
sourced S. cervisiae GSHR (Sigma, G3664).
The Km value of each enzyme was determined
for each of the three substrates: SeO32–, GSSG, and GS-Se-SG. It has been previously reported that the GSHR
enzymes have the ability to reduce these three substrates,13 with the proposed mechanisms for the GSH-based
substrates.25,26 While SeO32– (Alfa Aesar, 12585) and GSSG (Sigma, G4376) are commercially available,
we synthesized GS-Se-SG according to the previous published methods.26

The enzymatic rates for both enzymes with
both the GSSG and GS-Se-SG
substrates are plotted in Figure 1, panels (a,c). The data are plotted as NADPH cofactor
consumption, observed experimentally as the depletion of a spectroscopic
peak characteristic of NADPH (but not NADP+) at 340 nm.
The decay rate, as measured at 340 nm, was converted to a normalized
reaction rate. Lineweaver–Burke plots (shown as insets) were
generated for each enzyme to determine Vmax and Km for the corresponding substrates.
We chose to utilize the Lineweaver–Burke analysis over the
more current method of nonlinear regression because our data was not
accurately modeled using this technique. Points after 0.2 mM for GS-Se-SG
were not used for the determination of Km because of particle scattering altering the observed rate. Without
having the data points nearing the asymptote, the nonlinear regression
analysis suffered from large errors and major variations in the calculated
constants. When nonlinear regression was used for the analysis of
all GSSG data points, the reciprocal plots showed an uneven distribution,
indicating that the enzyme kinetics were not modeled correctly using
this method. Upon further investigation, we discovered that the reported Km values for SC GSHR were calculated using the
Lineweaver–Burke analysis.28 Using
the Lineweaver–Burke analysis granted us consistency across
our data analysis and allowed for comparison with the literature,
giving us the most accurate and comparable values relative to the
other common kinetic analyses. The determined Km values for each enzyme/substrate combination are shown in Table 2.

For the GRLMR
enzyme, we observe a remarkable specialization of
the enzyme for GS-Se-SG over GSSG. Specifically, the Km value of GRLMR is 25 times more favorable for GS-Se-SG
as compared to GSSG. This difference in Km for the two substrates strongly implies that the enzyme is specialized
for Se reduction over GSSG reduction. For S. cervisiae GSHR, we determined similar Km values
for GSSG and GS-Se-SG substrates, with the enzyme showing a slightly
greater affinity for GSSG. The values we find for both substrates
are consistent with the previous findings from other research groups.13,28,28 The Km value of GRLMR for SeO32– has not been
previously reported, to our knowledge. The physiological relevance
of the Km value for SeO32– is questionable, as Se salts such as SeO32– are converted to GS-Se-SG via GSH reduction
in vivo.29 We established here the Km value for SeO32– for both GRLMR and S. cervisiae GSHR
because we identified GRLMR on the basis of the SeO32– reductase activity, but note that the value is sufficiently
unfavorable compared to the GSH-based substrates that it is unlikely
to be physiologically relevant.

The value of Vmax for the GS-SG and
GS-Se-SG substrates track in tandem up to the initial concentrations
of 0.20 mM. Deviations begin near a concentration of 0.30 mM, where
the rate for GS-Se-SG has reached its maximum velocity, whereas the
rate for oxidized glutathione continues to increase until roughly
0.60 mM substrate concentration. The maximum velocity observed for
GSSG is approximately 14 times greater than the Vmax for GS-Se-SG, but this occurs at a larger substrate
concentration for GSSG, accounting for the lower affinity. It is possible
that the fall-off in rate that we observe at higher GS-Se-SG concentrations
is artifactual, arising from the interference in the optical assay
by the selenium NPs produced during the experiment.

Overall,
the Km values we find suggest
a strong substrate preference for GS-Se-SG for the GRLMR enzyme. This
is in contrast to the other characterized GSHR enzymes, where there
is essentially no differentiation between the substrates. The cellular
concentrations of GSSG would typically be much higher than GS-Se-SG
at sublethal amounts of selenium in vivo; thus, the SC GSHR enzyme
would turn over GSSG much more frequently and does not lead to selenium
resistance as in the P. Moraviensis system. To our knowledge, this is the first finding of an enzyme
specialized for reduction of GS-Se-SG over any other substrate. Such
a specialized enzyme could be used for nanomaterial development such
as biogenic quantum dots and, most notably, as a starting point for
the development of a functionalized clonable NP.

We hypothesized
that if GRLMR conveys SeO32– tolerance
to P. moraviensis, then
the recombinant expression of this enzyme may convey a similar tolerance
to the host organism for GRLMR expression. To evaluate this hypothesis,
we transformed the lab expression strains of E. coli, BL21 and SS320, with the isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG)-inducible expression vector described above. For the GRLMR
enzyme-expressing E. coli, we determined
selenite tolerance as the concentration of SeO32– that kills 90% of the cells (IC90). We also examined
the cells microscopically for the presence or absence of SeNPs.

For IC90 determination, identical volumes of cells were
plated on lysogeny broth (LB) agar and LB agar + SeO32–, each in triplicate, and grown overnight at 37 °C.
The following day, the colony-forming units (cfus) were counted. IC90 was calculated as the percentage of cfus present relative
to an identical control supplemented with 1.0 μM SeO32–. We determined 1.0 μM SeO32– as necessary for maximizing the number of observed
cfus. We hypothesize that such a supplementation is necessary because
the overexpression of a SeO32–- reducing
enzyme in these cells reduces and makes unavailable the essential
amount of Se needed as a micronutrient for optimum growth.30

Figure 2 shows relative
growth inhibition as a function of selenite concentration. The log10[SeO32–] gives a linear concentration
dependence for SeO32– growth inhibition.
This allows the determination of the inhibitory concentration of selenite
that eliminates 90% of cell growth (IC90). We found an
IC90 of 21.3 ± 9.80 mM under the conditions of GRLMR
overexpression, whereas an IC90 of 1.89 ± 0.46 mM
is observed in a corresponding control experiment. This result is
at least somewhat cell-line-independent. When GRLMR is recombinantly
overexpressed in E. coli SS320, we
observe an IC90 of 18.3 ± 19.50 mM. GRLMR scavenges
the cells of the micronutrient levels of selenium which can stunt
growth and cause cell death. This inherently causes large deviations
in cfu formation from run to run. Even with the large error bars,
a statistically significant increase in SeO32– tolerance is induced by the presence of the GRLMR plasmid, and we
believe that the SS320 data is justified because of the similarly
observed tolerance in the BL21 cell line.

concentration: (a) BL21 E. coli cell
lines with a GFP plasmid; (b) BL21 cells with the GRLMR plasmid; and
(c) SS320 cells with the GRLMR plasmid.

We note that the presence of the recombinantly expressed
enzyme
results in the liquid cultures taking on the red color characteristic
of the red allotrope of zerovalent selenium, whereas cultures grown
with SeO32– without the recombinantly
expressed enzyme do not take on this color. To illustrate this, Figure 3 shows the cell cultures
expressing GRLMR (left panel) or the green fluorescent protein (GFP)
(right panel) in the presence of SeO32– supplementation at 5.0 mM, after 3 h of exposure. This “bulk
color” change suggests that the cells expressing the recombinant
enzyme may also be forming Se(0) NPs, just as we previously observed
for the P. moravenis strain.

of selenium NP growth. BL21 cells with (right) and without
(left) the GRLMR plasmid after a 3 h exposure to 5.0 mM selenite-supplemented
LB.

The examination of cells by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM)
revealed the presence of selenium NPs in cells expressing the recombinant
enzyme and grown in Se-supplemented media. Figure 4 shows the scanning transmission electron
micrographs of glutaraldehyde-fixed dry-mounted BL21 E. coli cells expressing GFP or GRLMR after growth
in SeO32–-supplemented media. Both GFP
and GRLMR cells show dark inclusions, with more inclusions observed
in the GRLMR-expressing cell line. The dark inclusions seen in both
cell lines near the cell walls are most likely the cellular nuclei
because of their cellular placement and single appearance per cell.
Electron-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping confirms that the dark
inclusions are Se-rich for the GRLMR cells, whereas any inclusions
observed in the GFP-expressing cells show no evidence of Se presence.
The corresponding EDS spectra further confirm these conclusions by
the presence of signature selenium peaks being present for the GRLMR
cells and the absence of these peaks for the GFP cells. Complete EDS
mapping for the control and GRLMR cells can be seen in Figure S6. The intracellular Se-rich NPs have
an amorphous surface similar to our previously reported results,13 suggesting a partial cytosol-exposed surface.
This appears to be unique to our enzyme-synthesized particles because
inorganic/bioinorganic methods tend to make smooth-surfaced particles
and require capping agents for stabilization.31,32 The transportability of enzymatic function to foreign cell lines
further demonstrates the ability for this enzyme’s potential
application as a clonable NP contrast generator.

Cu mesh grids were used.

Previously, we observed that some fraction of NPs synthesized
by S. cervisiae GSHR were associated
with the particle
fraction.13 We examined GRLMR for a similar
behavior. Selenium particles were synthesized in vitro and were separated
from the solution using centrifugation. The analysis of the protein
content in the solution and the particles were determined by Bradford
assay (Bio-Rad). Overall, approximately 10% of the enzyme is associated
with the selenium NPs. This is a smaller fraction than we observed
for S. cervisiae GSHR (∼18%),
suggesting that the P. moravenis-derived
enzyme is more efficient at turning over or releasing the particles
that they create. Overall, this contributes to the picture of GRLMR
being specialized for conveying Se tolerance.

Differences in
the product-/substrate-binding pocket of this family
of enzymes may underlie any observed differences in substrate specificity
and enzyme activity. The key residues in the product-/substrate-binding
areas of GSHR are shown in Table 3, and the models of these are shown in Figure S3. The structural alignment between GRLMR and P. fluorescines reveals an RMSD of 1.71 Å for
the full enzyme and 1.56 Å for the product-/substrate-binding
pocket. These values show the largest deviation between any of the
enzymes considered here, but to the best of our knowledge, no crystal
structure of Pseudomonas GSHR has been
obtained which would affect the generated structure models.

The product-/substrate-binding
pocket for GSHR contains a set of
evolutionarily conserved residues, most notably including a cysteine
that is implicated in glutathionylation regulatory mechanisms. There
are three residues that dominate the binding interaction, one on an
α-helix, and two on parallel β-strands (βL, βR).
Comparing our Pseudomonas enzymes,
we see that they contain the same key residues; α-Ser, βL-Lys,
and βR-Glu (Figure 5).33

residues, and yellow––GSH. (a) Yeast GHSR substrate-binding
pocket with bound GSH. (b) E. coli GSHR

This absence of a sulfur-containing
residue (Figure 1)
in the P. moravenis GRLMR suggests
that the enzyme is not subject to the glutathionylation
regulatory mechanism well-established for canonical GSHR enzymes such
as S. cervisiae GSHR. Glutathionylation
of enzymes is a common post-translation modification for proteins
in signaling pathways and survival gene modification.34−37 This reversible post-translation modification is the binding of
glutathione to an unpaired cysteine residue.38 Such a modification alters the enzyme activity, presumably as a
regulation mechanism.39,40 In the case of S. cervisiae GSHR, glutathionylation at C239 (Figure 5) inhibits the enzyme.
Chemically blocking the glutathionylation pathway is shown to increase
the GSHR activity by a factor of 2.1.41 Overall, the absence of the possibility of a glutathionylation regulation
mechanism for the GRLMR enzyme suggests that it is distinct from the
other GSHR enzymes.

The selenium metabolism literature highlights
several examples
of species within the Pseudomonas genus
with remarkable tolerance to Se. In many cases, GSHR enzymes are implicated
in the tolerance. GSHR was responsible for reducing selenite and tellurite
to insoluble NPs using the O-2 strain of Pseudomonas
maltophilia;42 GSHR and
thioredoxin reductase are responsible for selenite and selenate reduction
in Pseudomonas seleniipraecipitansI.43−46 The highly conserved sequence across species within the Pseudomonas genus, including conservation in the
product/substrate binding pocket, is suggestive that the ability to
handle the normally toxic amounts of SeO32– may be a general feature of the Pseudomonas genus. This Se tolerance may arise from the nature of GSHRs in this
genus.

Conclusions
In summary, we have characterized GRLMR
from the bacterium Pseudomonas moraviensis stanleyae. The kinetic studies
showed an overall decrease in substrate affinity for GRLMR relative
to the S. cervisiae GSHR, but an overall
increased affinity for GS-Se-SG over GSSG. The transportability of
the gene was tested by transforming the lab strain E. coli with GRLMR. Selenite tolerance increased
10-fold compared to the cells without the gene, and elemental red
selenium was formed when GRLMR was present. SEM/EDS further confirmed
this by showing the selenium particles associated with the cells containing
the gene. Product association experiments showed a decrease in product
retention when compared to the S. cervisiae GSHR, which ultimately allows for increased product release and
contributes to the overall Se tolerance.

Materials and Methods
Identification/Isolation
An LB agar plate with colonies
of the original P. moravenis cell line
was submitted for full-genome sequencing. The DNA sequence from the
most closely related enzyme identified by MALDI-MS was used to identify
the sequence of our enzyme of interest. This sequence was cloned into
a pD441-CH E. coli vector, and a standard
heat-shock protocol was used to transform BL21 E. coli.

Standard protein purification was conducted by growing cells
in 1 L of LB to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of
0.6 and inducing protein expression with 1 mM IPTG for 2 h. The cells
were collected and resuspended in 25 mL of lysis buffer and lysed
by tip sonication. The soluble cell lysate was collected and nickel-agarose
beads were used to isolate and wash our expressed protein.

GS-Se-SG
Synthesis
The protocol from Ganther was followed
for the synthesis of selenodiglutathione.26 To 24 mL of 0.1 M HCl, 400 moles of HNaSeO3 was added
and cooled to 4 °C. Another solution of 0.1 M GSH was cooled
to 4 °C and added quickly to the selenite solution. The mixture
was allowed to react at 4 °C for 20 min. A 2.5 mL of 2 M NaOAc
was added to obtain a final pH of 4.5. A C18 column was used to separate
the products using pH 2.0 HCl. Thin-layer chromatography was used
to check the contents of the lyophilized fractions. The isolated GS-Se-SG
was identified and the amount quantified using UV–vis absorption
at 263 nm. (S.4)

Km
1 mL reactions
were conducted in 1× phosphate-buffered
saline with 0.1 mM NADPH and 15 μg of either purified enzyme
or S. cervisiae GSHR purchased from
Sigma. The substrates tested were GSSG, GS-Se-SG, and selenite. Their
concentrations were varied between reactions, and the depletion of
the NADPH peak at 340 nm was monitored every 2 s after the contents
were mixed.

Transportability
IC90’s were determined
by standard plating experiments. In short, cultures of BL21 cells
containing either a plasmid with GRLMR or a generic reporter gene
were grown overnight in LB at 37 °C. The following morning, 100
μL of this starter culture was added to 2.5 mL of fresh LB and
grown for roughly 2.5 h to reach an OD600 of 0.6. Various
amounts of selenite were added to each culture, and exposure was continued
for 24 h. After the exposure, the cells were diluted 106–fold, and 20 μL of each dilution was plated in triplicate
on 1× Kanamycin LB agar. The plates were put in an oven at 37
°C, and colonies were grown overnight and counted the following
day.

Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM)
A
volume of 3 mL of BL21 cells containing either a metalloid reductase
gene or GFP reporter gene was grown separately in 10 mL culture tubes
overnight containing LB medium (Teknova) supplemented with Kanamycin
at 25 μg/mL. The following morning, the culture was added to
a 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing LB medium supplemented with Kanamycin
(25 μg/mL). The cells were grown for 2.5 h, and 100 mM Na2SeO3 (Alfa Aesar, 98+%) was added to reach a final
concentration of 5 mM. The cells were collected by centrifuging for
20 min at 4000 rpm and 4 °C after 3 h of growth with selenite.
The cells were washed with 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4) (Fischer) three times
followed by resuspension in 1 mL of fixing solution (2% glutaraldehyde
(25% Sigma-Aldrich) and 2.5% formaldehyde); the fixing solution was
allowed to react for 12 h at 4 °C. The fixing solution was centrifuged
and the pellet was washed five times in 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4). The cells
were resuspended in 1 mL of 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4). The aliquots (4 μL)
were mounted on 400 mesh Cu grids with 50 nm C coating and washed
two times with H2O. The dry-mounted cells on transmission
electron microscopy grids were loaded onto a STEM holder. The STEM
images were taken with a JEOL JSM-6500-F scanning electron microscope
at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV.

EDS
EDS was performed
on the P. moreviensis stanleyae cells
with SEM, as described above. EDS was collected
on a NORAN System 7 X-ray microanalysis detector with a time interval
of 1 s.
