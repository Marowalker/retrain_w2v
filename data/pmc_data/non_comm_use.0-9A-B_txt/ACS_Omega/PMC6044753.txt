In this study, we
apply a battery of molecular similarity techniques
to known inhibitors of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO), querying
each against a repository of approved, experimental, nutraceutical,
and illicit drugs. Four compounds are assayed against KMO. Subsequently,
diclofenac (also known by the trade names Voltaren, Voltarol, Aclonac,
and Cataflam) has been confirmed as a human KMO protein binder and
inhibitor in cell lysate with low micromolar KD and IC50, respectively, and low millimolar cellular
IC50. Hit to drug hopping, as exemplified here for one
of the most successful anti-inflammatory medicines ever invented,
holds great promise for expansion into new disease areas and highlights
the not-yet-fully-exploited potential of drug repurposing.

Introduction
Increasing costs1 and attrition rates2 associated with bringing a new drug to market
have driven interest in repurposing existing drugs for new indications.3,4 Routine use of drugs “off-label” is well-documented
and most prevalent in pediatrics, with drugs typically approved for
use in adults being prescribed by physicians for use in children.5,6 With the ability to use existing, approved drugs “off-label”,
the application of molecular similarity techniques offers an extremely
attractive route toward treating disease states, identifying approved
drugs capable of making similar interactions to known ligands of target
proteins.

Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) is a nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADPH)-dependent flavoprotein hydroxylase that catalyzes
the hydroxylation of kynurenine (l-Kyn) to generate cytotoxic
3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK).7,8 KMO has been identified
as an important therapeutic target in systemic inflammation triggered
by acute pancreatitis9,10 and in Huntington’s disease.11 KMO is a key regulator of metabolic flux through
the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism, the main route of
tryptophan metabolism in mammals.12 Perturbations
in KMO activity, using genetically altered mice deficient in KMO12 and by specific inhibitors,12,13 generate biologically important alterations in plasma and tissue
concentrations of several neuroactive and immunoregulatory metabolites.
KMO is found in high concentrations in the liver and kidney and is
also expressed by macrophages and microglia cells.7 The protein is localized on the mitochondrial outer membrane
and contains a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids at its C terminus,
which is believed to be the mitochondrial membrane-anchoring domain.13 This transmembrane domain is thought to account
for the solubility difficulties encountered during the recombinant
protein production of the human enzyme.14 The crystal structure of human KMO remains as-yet unsolved in the
public domain. Crystallization of membrane proteins is particularly
challenging because of the need for high yields of correctly folded,
homogeneous, stable protein.15 Importantly,
detergent is commonly required for the solubility and stability of
membrane proteins but is often detrimental to the success of crystallization
attempts.16 Approaches to tackle human
KMO inhibition using a Pseudomonas fluorescens KMO crystal structure have been successful,17,18 resulting in the exploration of active compound series and progression
to a clinical candidate.19 In our study,
we took a ligand-based20 approach, applying
molecular similarity techniques to rank approved and experimental
drugs in similarity to known KMO inhibitors.

Results and Discussion
Ten small molecules known to be KMO inhibitors with nanomolar-
to low-micromolar-range half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) (Supporting Information Table
S1) were selected as input to molecular similarity techniques (see Experimental Section). Small-molecule similars were
extracted from the DrugBank21 database.
Nine of the actives were deemed too dissimilar to anything in DrugBank
to follow up experimentally. One active compound, termed “Pharmacia
WO199805660 core scaffold” displayed a high degree of similarity
to seven small molecules within DrugBank (Supporting Information Table S2). Patent literature documents derivatives
of the Pharmacia WO199805660 core scaffold as having IC50s of less than 100 μM against Rattus norvegicus KMO. Substructure searching of the ChEMBL database22 (version 23) revealed a series of 16 derivatives that have
activities on eight kinases based on an IC50 value cutoff
of 10 μM (see Supporting Information Table S3). However, no targets for the unmodified Pharmacia WO199805660
core scaffold are reported in ChEMBL. We were able to purchase only
four (Figure 1) of
the seven priority molecules: quinaldic acid, dipicolinic acid, sulfapyridine,
and diclofenac. Quinaldic acid is a product of l-Kyn catabolism
via the kynurenic acid side arm of the kynurenine pathway.23 Dipicolinic acid composes 5–15% of bacterial
spores by weight and has been proposed as a key component in their
heat stress pathways.24 Sulfapyridine,
an antibacterial classically used to treat pneumonia and widely used
during the Second World War, is now no longer widely prescribed because
of the problems with crystallization in the bladder. Finally, diclofenac,
a nanomolar inhibitor of cyclooxygenases, is a widely used nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory25 used to treat inflammation
and pain in both humans and animals.

Figure 1 Molecular similarity to the Pharmacia
WO199805660 core scaffold
led to four compounds being sourced for testing. Only diclofenac was
identified as an active inhibitor of KMO.

The four commercially available compounds were assayed in
our KMO
lysate enzymatic inhibition assay.26 Only
diclofenac was shown to have inhibitory properties against the KMO
enzyme, achieving a 38% inhibition at a diclofenac concentration of
10 μM. Enzymatic testing revealed an IC50 of 13.6
± 1.34 μM for diclofenac against KMO in the cell lysate
and 1.35 ± 0.10 mM against whole cells, as shown by the dose–response
curves in Figure 2.
Our microdialysis binding assay27 demonstrated
a KD of 64.84 ± 29.47 μM for
the interaction and direct binding of diclofenac to KMO (Table 1).

of KMO by diclofenac in whole cells

After the confirmation of
diclofenac as a binder and inhibitor
of KMO, five Saccharomyces cerevisiae KMO crystal structures were published by Amaral et al.28 Of key interest to the evaluation of diclofenac
as a KMO inhibitor are two of these structures: first, PDB ID 4J36 containing KMO,
a flavin–adenine dinucleotide (FAD) molecule, and a small-molecule
inhibitor and second UPF 648, a 2-(3,4-dichlorobenzoyl)cyclopropanecarboxylic
acid, displaying a Ki of 74 ± 14
nM against yeast KMO and 56.7 ± 6.8 nM against human KMO. Another
structure with PDB ID 4J33 contains S. cerevisiae KMO bound to only the FAD molecule, allowing a valuable comparison
of conformational changes upon inhibitor binding. Amaral et al. suggest,
through the use of model building, that UPF 648 acts as a mimic of l-Kyn, binding into the same pocket, blocking l-Kyn
turnover via NADPH into 3-HK. However, UPF 648 is larger than l-Kyn, with a molecular weight of 259 versus 208, and has a
significantly more hydrophobic bulk (clog P values
of 2.27 and −1.3, respectively). This is structurally accounted
for by loop movement (Pro321–Gln325) and reorientation of a
six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. Amaral asserts the validity
for the use of S. cerevisiae KMO as
a template for a structure-based drug design against human KMO. In
addition, the nonhuman structure of P. fluorescens KMO has been used to develop compounds with nanomolar IC50s18 as well as a clinical candidate.19 Visual overlays of UPF 648 and diclofenac show
a striking similarity, suggesting a common binding mode. Indeed, docking
of diclofenac into the S. cerevisiae KMO structure with PDB ID 4J36 using Autodock Vina 1.1.2 (see Figure 3 and Supporting Information for docking protocol) reveals a plausible binding mode.

(magenta) and UPF 648 (blue). Predicted binding mode of diclofenac
(cyan) is shown in the overlay.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have successfully applied molecular
similarity
methods to identify diclofenac, an approved and widely used drug,
as capable of binding to, and inhibiting, human KMO with a limited
low micromolar affinity and activity in vitro and in cell lysate.
Because of the difficulty in purifying full-length human KMO, the
binding affinity is possibly underestimated and might be closer to
the lysate-derived IC50 value, with both results representing
good estimates. The considerable potency reduction of ∼1 log
step of diclofenac in cells is likely due to the impaired cellular
permeability associated with the carboxylic acid moiety. Additionally,
diclofenac is known to bind to and inhibit many extra- and intracellular
targets. Interestingly, none of the eight kinases reported as targets
for the Pharmacia core scaffold are shared with diclofenac. The ChEMBL
database (version 23) reports single-digit nanomolar IC50s/KDs for three protein targets—cyclooxygenase
1 and 2 and the interleukin-8 receptor A. See Supporting Information Table S4 for ChEMBL-assigned targets
of diclofenac. Depending on the abundance and affinities of the high
number of known targets for diclofenac, the effective concentration
exposed to intracellular KMO may be greatly reduced. It is important
to emphasize that the presented results only highlight a starting
point for a possible drug repurposing process. However, the data serve
to highlight the power of molecular similarity techniques and their
value in the discovery of medicinal chemistry starting points and
the prediction of off-target effects. Intensive work combining structural
biology and several rounds of medicinal chemistry would be needed
to identify a diclofenac derivative with nanomolar activity to reach
a lead compound status for KMO.

Experimental Section
Molecular
Similarity
A survey of literature followed
by visual inspection and clustering identified 10 potent KMO inhibitors
(Supporting Information Table S1) that
had their predicted lowest energy three-dimensional (3D) conformation
generated using Omega229 (OpenEye Scientific,
version 2.3.2) and written out in the SD file format. A data set containing
approved, experimental, nutraceutical, illicit, and withdrawn drugs
was obtained from the DrugBank21 Web service
(data downloaded on 30/6/2010), and the same 3D conformer generation
procedure was applied with the addition of a salt-stripping step using
OpenBabel30 (version 2.2.2), generating
4648 low-energy conformers. Programs implementing MACCS, Path, and
LINGO fingerprints were implemented in the Java programming language
using the Chemistry Development Kit.31 C++
programs were written making use of the OpenBabel API30 to generate FP2, FP3, and FP4 fingerprints. Implementations
of USR32 and UFSRAT33 were also written in C++. Tanimoto distances34 were used to score molecules by fingerprint-based
methods (FP2, FP3, FP4, Path, LINGO, and MACCS). A simple Euclidean
distance was used for USR and UFSRAT similarity comparison scoring.
Each of the 10 known KMO inhibitors was then scored against each of
the 4648 drug data set using each of the 8 measures of molecular similarity,
resulting in a total of 371 840 similarity comparisons (see Supporting Information spreadsheet). Each similarity
method run on a known inhibitor was then sorted in the order of descending
level of calculated similarity. See Supporting Information for full results. Manual inspection of results
revealed that only the UFSRAT similarity method applied to the Pharmacia
WO199805660 core scaffold gave rise to convincing similars. Seven
of these similars were prioritized, but only four were available for
purchase and subsequent assay.

Cloning of full-length human
KMO (KMO (V5-6His) construct), expression of this construct in HEK293
cells, and analysis of KMO enzymatic activity using liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC–MS) were performed, as described by us previously.10

Compound IC50 Determination in
the KMO Lysate
To determine the IC50 of compounds
against human KMO enzyme
in the cell lysate,10 the compounds were
incubated in duplicate at the following concentrations: 200, 100,
50, 20, 10, 1, 0.5, 0.2, and 0.1 μM. The low control for this
assay consisted of 200 μg of cell lysate (total protein) in
the absence of an inhibitor, whereas high controls were enzyme-free.

IC50 data were plotted using the GraFit v5.0.1 software
(Erithacus Software Limited). The standard IC50 equation
in GraFit, , was used to
fit the data to obtain IC50 and the Hill slope value s. Input parameters
were percentage of inhibition (y) and logarithm of
compound concentration (x).

Cellular Compound IC50 Determination
The
IC50 values of compounds were tested in the cellular context
to determine the cell permeability of test compounds. HEK293-KMO(V5-6His)
cells were passaged in 96-well plates at 2 × 104 cells
per well in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with
10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin–streptomycin.
The cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2/95% O2. The assay medium utilized was opti-MEM containing
1% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin–streptomycin, and 200
μM l-Kyn. The compounds for testing were diluted in
this medium with a final dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) concentration of
1%. 3-HK was diluted in the assay medium in the absence of l-Kyn to produce a standard curve with the following concentrations:
200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 1, 0.5, 0.2, and 0.1 μM. Low controls
consisted of opti-MEM with 1% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin–streptomycin,
200 μM l-Kyn, and 1% DMSO, whereas high controls consisted
of the same buffer minus l-Kyn. The standards, compounds,
and control dilutions were added to the cells over 20 h at 37 °C
in 5% CO2/95% O2. Following incubation, the
assay samples (i.e., cellular supernatants) were transferred to a
96-well masterblock before the addition of 500 μL of acetonitrile
containing 25 μg/mL d5-tryptophan per well to terminate activity.
This solution was dried under nitrogen, and each sample was solubilized
by the addition of 100 μL of 30:70 methanol/water with 0.1%
formic acid. The samples were transferred to 96-well v-bottom plates
for MS analysis. (MS analysis was performed as described above.)

Microdialysis
Microdialysis was used to assess the
direct binding affinity, expressed as dissociation constant, KD, of diclofenac for KMO in a method similar
to that reported by Weidemann et al.27 KMO
(expressed as above) was enriched by NiNTA affinity chromatography.
RED (rapid equilibrium dialysis) device inserts (molecular weight
cutoff 8 kDa) were placed in the wells of a compatible base plate
(Piece, Thermo Scientific). The enriched KMO target protein was diluted
to a concentration of 10 μM in the assay buffer [20 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid pH 7.0] in a total volume of 100 μL and added to the sample
chamber of the RED device insert. Assay buffer (300 μL) was
added to the dialysis chamber of the RED device insert. The compound
was added to the starter volume of the sample chamber at a final concentration
of 20 μM. Controls consisted of compounds at the same concentration
in the assay buffer in the absence of the enzyme. The plate was covered
with a sealing tape and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C with rotation
at 100 rpm. Samples of 50 μL were obtained from both the sample
and dialysis compartments of the chamber and transferred to LC–MS
vials with 10 μL of acetonitrile per sample for MS analysis
(see Supporting Information). KD values were calculated using the data obtained from
MS analysis according to the formula determined by Weidemann et al.27 Diclofenac was diluted in the assay buffer at
the concentrations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 μM in LC–MS
vials to provide a standard curve, allowing quantification of concentrations
from the assay samples. The samples were analyzed using the MS method
previously described.35
