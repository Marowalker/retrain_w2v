Soft,
wearable or printable strain sensors derived from conductive polymer
nanocomposites (CPNs) are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in personal-care
applications. Common elastomers employed in the fabrication of such
piezoresistive CPNs frequently rely on chemically cross-linked polydiene
or polysiloxane chemistry, thereby generating relatively inexpensive
and reliable sensors that become solid waste upon application termination.
Moreover, the shape anisotropy of the incorporated conductive nanoparticles
can produce interesting electrical effects due to strain-induced spatial
rearrangement. In this study, we investigate the morphological, mechanical,
electrical, and electromechanical properties of CPNs generated from
thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) triblock copolymer systems containing
vapor-grown carbon nanofiber (CNF). Modulus-tunable TPE gels imbibed
with a midblock-selective aliphatic oil exhibit well-behaved properties
with increasing CNF content, but generally display nonlinear negative
piezoresistance at different strain amplitudes and stretch rates due
to nanofiber mobility upon CPN strain-cycling. In contrast, a neat
TPE possessing low hard-block content yields a distinctive strain-reversible
piezoresistive response, as well as low electrical hysteresis, upon
cyclic deformation. Unlike their chemically cross-linked analogs,
these physically cross-linked and thus environmentally benign CPNs
are fully reprocessable by thermal and/or solvent means.

Introduction
Concurrent development
of portable electronic devices and soft responsive materials is responsible
for generating a new class of functional devices for personal healthcare
and electronic textiles.1−5 Such devices augment flexible polymeric materials with electronic
capabilities for a wide range of sensory applications, such as motion
or pulse monitoring.6,7 They can be freestanding as, for
example, a wristband8,9 or printed as a thin conductive
coating on a substrate, including fabrics.10 While inherently conductive polymers such as polypyrrole are often
suitable for these purposes,11−13 they are generally expensive
to process and frequently unstable. Conductive polymer nanocomposites
(CPNs), consisting of electrically conductive nanoparticles homogeneously
dispersed in an elastomeric matrix, constitute viable alternatives
to conductive polymers for use in electronic devices.14−21 Important advantages of CPNs for these purposes include the use
of nanoscale fillers that can vary in size, shape, species, and therefore
conductivity; nanofillers generally possessing a large surface-to-volume
ratio that favors surface functionalization to promote dispersability
within an organic matrix;22−25 preparation and application methodologies that are
both straightforward and cost-effective; and fabrication that extends
from freestanding films exhibiting high extensibility to conformal
print layers deposited over large, nonuniform areas. Another attractive
aspect of CPNs is that the electrical and mechanical properties are
composition-tunable,26 which favors the
use of conductive nanofillers possessing a low percolation threshold
signaling the onset of a continuous conductive network in the polymer
matrix. Excellent examples of nanofillers fulfilling this requirement
are carbon black (CB),27 carbon nanotubes
(CNTs),28−30 graphene (G),31,32 and carbon nanofibers
(CNFs).10,33 Their high surface-to-volume ratio and correspondingly
high surface area permit surface functionalization to ensure good
dispersion and strong matrix–filler bonding.

In this
study, we focus on CPNs containing CNF, which possesses high conductivity
levels and relatively low percolation thresholds34 ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 vol %, depending on processing
methodology and CNF characteristics.35−37 These nanofillers are
particularly appealing because of their facile dispersability in a
wide variety of polymer matrices, as well as their lower cost compared
to that of CNTs. The elastomers utilized in the present work consist
of triblock copolymers that, with glassy endblocks and a rubbery midblock,
behave as thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs).38 Due to the thermodynamic incompatibility between the chemically
dissimilar sequences, these copolymers microphase-separate39−41 to form glassy micelles that serve as physical cross-links to stabilize
a molecular network composed of bridged midblocks.42−44 This elastomer
motif extends to TPEs preferentially swollen in a midblock-selective
oil, and the phase behavior of, along with the fraction of midblock
bridges in, the resulting TPE gels (TPEGs) has been found to depend
on copolymer composition, molecular weight, architecture, and concentration.45,46 Incorporation of CNFs into the TPEs considered here results in CPNs
that can be used as piezoresistive sensors capable of relating sensor
resistivity to strain state for real-time monitoring of bodily functions6,47−49 (e.g., respiration and cardiovascular activity) insofar
as high-sensitivity sensors possess low strain-cycling hysteresis50 to maintain superior signal integrity. In one
such design, CB-containing TPEs have been reported51−53 to exhibit
either linear or nonlinear positive piezoresistance wherein resistance
increases with increasing strain. While this phenomenon is typically
induced in CPNs by in-plane tensile strain, several efforts have likewise
demonstrated that strain-reversible piezoresistivity in which a negative
→ positive piezoresistivity transition that is repeatable upon
strain cycling occurs in CPNs containing anisotropic nanofillers,
including G,54 CNT,55 and CNF.10 In the present study,
we examine the morphological, mechanical, electrical, and electromechanical
properties of CNF/TPE(G) CPNs.

Results and Discussion
The present
study focuses on the preparation and characterization of soft, low-hysteresis
sensory materials that consist of either a neat TPE or an oil-containing
TPEG modified with CNF. A representative scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) image of the vapor-grown CNFs deposited from suspension is displayed
in Figure 1 and qualitatively
confirms the nanofiber dimensions listed by the supplier (see the Experimental Section). The enlarged area reveals
that some of the nanofibers are at least semiflexible. To ensure a
relatively uniform dispersion of CNF in each of the CPNs investigated
here, we have concurrently prepared TPE solutions permitted to reach
equilibrium and CNF suspensions exposed to high-shear mixing before
combining them and subjecting the resultant suspension to additional
high-shear mixing. Further heat treatment during melt-pressing assists
in both solvent removal and refinement of the TPE morphology. Although
we do not provide electron microscopy images or small-angle scattering
data of the TPE or TPEG employed in this work, previous morphological
investigations have conclusively established56−58 that, under
the present experimental conditions, both materials exhibit a spherical
morphology wherein glassy styrenic (S) micelles are arranged on an
unspecified lattice. Due to the size of the midblock relative to each
of the endblocks in conventional TPEs (typically with 30–33
wt % endblocks), the most commonly observed morphology consists of
“hairy” micelles arranged on a body-centered cubic lattice.
In the presence of a midblock-selective oil that can disrupt long-range
order, however, face-centered cubic and hexagonal close-packed morphologies
have also been reported. While the TPE(G) morphology governs property
development, the only morphological aspect of interest here is the
presence of spherical micelles, which ensure45 the highest fraction of midblock bridges needed for a highly elastomeric
material.

Figure 1 SEM image of the as-received vapor-grown carbon nanofiber (CNF)
employed in this study.

A series of cross-fracture SEM images acquired at two different
magnifications (arranged in rows) from TPEG-based CPNs varying in
CNF content from 4 to 6 wt % is provided in Figure 2. In these and subsequent images, the CNF
appears bright due to its ability to conduct electrons. At 4 wt %
CNF in Figure 2a,d,
the nanofibers possess random trajectories and indicate little evidence
of long-range correlation. Some large regions observed in Figure 2a appear dark (without
CNF), implying that the CNF distribution within these TPEGs is not
entirely uniform. As the CNF content is increased to 5 wt % in Figure 2b,e, more nanofibers
are visible. Interestingly, regions largely devoid of CNF remain evident
in Figure 2b. At the
highest CNF fraction examined here (6 wt %), the nanofibers seen in Figure 2c,f are more numerous
relative to the earlier images and are more highly correlated. Taken
together (Figure 2a–c,d–f),
the CNF population and spatial arrangement in these image series can
be interpreted to predict that the CPN stiffness (expressed in terms
of tensile modulus) and conductivity (expressed in terms of electrical
resistivity) both increase with increasing CNF content. These properties
are considered further below. Similar morphological trends are apparent
in Figure 3 for the
TPE-based CPNs at the same CNF loading levels as those in Figure 2. An important difference
between the images in Figures 2 and 3 is the absence of relatively
large regions that lack CNF in Figure 3. At the lowest CNF fraction (4 wt %) in Figure 3a,d, nanofibers are isolated
but uniformly dispersed. In marked contrast, semiflexible CNF seems
highly connected at 5 wt % in Figure 3b,e and then highly correlated at 6 wt % in Figure 3c,f. The extent to
which the CNF appears correlated in Figures 2c and 3c is qualitatively
comparable.

nanocomposites (CPNs) composed of CNF (bright conductive features)

matrix) at three different loading levels (labeled) and presented
at two different magnifications in (a)–(c) and (d)–(f).
Each scale bar corresponds to all images in its row.

CNF (bright conductive features) embedded in a neat styrenic thermoplastic
elastomer (TPE, dark nonconductive matrix) at three different loading

images in its row.

Quasistatic tensile tests
of CPNs composed of the CNF-containing TPEG and TPE are presented
in Figure 4a,b, respectively,
and immediately reveal that the addition of CNF shifts the response
curve of each material to progressively higher stresses. This shift
is more clearly delineated for the TPEG-based CPNs in Figure 4a due to the inherently lower
stresses generated with these soft materials. Since the sensors considered
here are not expected to function at very high strain levels, we have
not evaluated the ultimate properties of these CPNs at failure (which
can exceed 2000% strain for unmodified TPEGs derived from midblock-swollen
triblock copolymers56). Values of the tensile
modulus (E) extracted from response curves such as
those displayed in Figure 4a,b are included in Figure 4c and indicate that E increases with
increasing CNF content in both material systems. While the composition
dependence of E is routinely expressed in terms of
a mixing rule,23,59−61 the increases
in E evident in Figure 4c can alternatively be empirically modeled
as an exponential function of the form E = E0 exp(αϕ), where E0 ideally represents the modulus of the neat
TPE(G) without CNF, α is a fitted parameter, and ϕ denotes
the CNF content (in wt %).a,b Values of α obtained by regression of this
expression to the data (with an adjustable E0) are numerically comparable for TPEG- and TPE-based CPNs.
Although such similarity between independent α values is comforting,
this empirical correlation does not imply a fundamental physical relationship.
Rather, the primary purpose of these tensile measurements is to discern
the extent to which the mechanical properties of the CPNs change in
two related polymer matrices upon addition of CNF. Without mineral
oil, the TPE (with E = 1.28 MPa) possesses a higher
modulus than that of the TPEG (with E = 0.15 MPa)
by about an order of magnitude, confirming that the addition of a
midblock-selective diluent can lower the modulus below that of a neat
TPE with a higher rubber content. The ability to tune the properties
of TPEGs beyond what is achievable with neat TPEs constitutes an important
consideration in the development of soft materials.

Figure 4 Nominal stress presented
as a function of strain at different CNF loading levels (in wt %)
during quasistatic uniaxial tensile testing for CPNs composed of (a)
TPEG/CNF and (b) TPE/CNF. Results from different loading levels are
labeled and color-coded. Tensile moduli extracted from data such as
those included in (a) and (b) are displayed as a function of CNF content
in (c) for each series (labeled). The solid lines in (c) represent
exponential regressions to the data and serve as guides for the eye.

Since the current materials are
being proposed for sensory applications, their static (i.e., deformation-free)
electrical properties must be elucidated as a function of CNF content.
For this reason, volume resistivity measurements are provided for
both TPEG- and TPE-based CPNs in Figure 5. Without CNF, the two matrix elastomers
exhibit high resistivity levels ranging from about 1016 to 1018 Ω cm. As anticipated from prior studies,62,63 incorporation of CNF improves conductivity by reducing the resistivity
by several orders of magnitude. In the case of the TPE-based CPNs,
the resistivity undergoes a precipitous drop from ca. 3 × 1013 to 5 × 106 Ω cm, indicative of a percolation
threshold between 2 and 3 wt %. In addition to percolation theory64 (which presumes universal behavior on the basis
of network characteristics), a variety of theoretical models interpret
the percolation threshold by accounting for such factors as random
heterogeneities and quantum tunneling.65,66 In marked
contrast, the CNF-induced reduction in resistivity for the TPEG-based
CPNs does not display an abrupt change in resistivity. Instead, the
decrease in resistivity is gradual after remaining almost constant
up to 1 wt % CNF. This behavior likely reflects the presence of liquid
mineral oil, which wets CNF surfaces and thus hinders contact between
neighboring nanoparticles. In addition, volume resistivities measured
from both CPN series are observed to converge unexpectedly at 7 wt
% CNF. The results presented in Figures 4 and 5 confirm that
the addition of CNF to either the TPEG or TPE utilized in this study
simultaneously increases both the modulus and conductivity (by reducing
the resistivity), which is consistent with the SEM images included
in Figures 2 and 3. Morphological dissimilarities, coupled with the
nontrivial variation in electrical properties evident in Figure 5, further suggest
that the electromechanical properties of TPEG- and TPE-based CPNs
can be expected to differ. These properties, critically important
for sensor performance, are discussed below.

Figure 5 Dependence of volume
resistivity measurements on CNF content for two series of CPNs: TPEG/CNF
(○) and TPE/CNF (●). The solid lines serve to connect
the data, and the percolation threshold for the TPE/CNF materials
is displayed as the shaded region.

As described in the Experimental Section, the extent to which the CPNs are uniaxially strained is investigated
in conjunction with the elongation, or stretch, rate. Maximum strain
values examined here reflect material limitations regarding either
signal quality (TPEGs) or matrix integrity (TPEs) upon strain cycling.
Cyclic electrical resistance measurements are provided as a function
of time (or strain) for TPEG-based CPNs containing 6 wt % CNF and
subjected to 10 and 20% strain in Figures 6 and 7, respectively.
In each of these figures, panel (a) provides results that are strain-cycled
at a stretch rate of 20 mm/min and panel (b) displays analogous resistance
data collected at 100 mm/min. For comparison, resistance measurements
acquired during the first and last full strain cycles for each stretch
rate are plotted together as a function of dimensionless time (normalized
with respect to the cycle time) in panel (c). First, we consider the
TPEG strain-cycled to 10% in Figure 6a,b. At both 20 and 100 mm/min, the maximum resistances
averaged over 50 strain cycles are 1.60 ± 0.01 and 1.57 ±
0.01 MΩ, respectively, whereas the mean minimum resistances
exhibit slightly more variation: 1.20 ± 0.04 MΩ at 20 mm/min
and 1.27 ± 0.04 MΩ at 100 mm/min, respectively. The single-cycle
comparisons included in Figure 6c reveal several notable features. The most important aspect
of these data is that the electrical resistance generally decreases
nonlinearly with increasing strain up to the 10% strain limit, at
which time it undergoes strain reversal and proceeds to increase with
decreasing strain until the cycle is completed. Such behavior identifies
the existence of nonlinear negative piezoresistance during the first
and final cycles for both stretch rates. Less consistent results are
apparent for the same TPEG-based CPNs subjected to 20% strain in Figure 7. The maximum and
minimum resistance values measured at 20 mm/min in Figure 7a are 1.49 ± 0.03 and
0.70 ± 0.07 MΩ, respectively, whereas those corresponding
to 100 mm/min in Figure 7b are 1.21 ± 0.05 and 0.53 ± 0.15 MΩ, respectively.
In Figure 7c, the more
variable results imply inferior piezoresistive behavior, as well as
overall signal quality.

as a function of time (or, alternatively, cyclic strain) for CPNs
composed of TPEG/CNF and exposed to 10% strain at two different stretch
rates (in mm/min): (a) 20 and (b) 100. In (c), results are displayed
as a function of time normalized with respect to the time of a single
cycle and correspond to the first and final cycles (solid and dotted
lines, respectively) from tests performed at 20 (black) and 100 (red)
mm/min. The dashed line (labeled) identifies the normalized time (at
0.5) corresponding to strain reversal.

Figure 7 Cyclic electromechanical measurements presented as a function of
time (or, alternatively, cyclic strain) for CPNs composed of TPEG/CNF
and exposed to 20% strain at two different stretch rates (in mm/min):
(a) 20 and (b) 100. In (c), results are displayed as a function of
time normalized with respect to the time of a single cycle and correspond
to the first and final cycles (solid and dotted lines, respectively)
from tests performed at 20 (black) and 100 (red) mm/min. The dashed
line (labeled) identifies the normalized time (at 0.5) corresponding
to strain reversal.

The single-cycle data
collected at 10% strain and 100 mm/min appear relatively smooth in Figure 6c, but those corresponding
to 20 mm/min are significantly noisier. We attribute the resistance
fluctuations visible in these data to dynamically occurring changes
in CNF connectivity. The nanofibers, residing in an oil-swollen rubber
matrix, possess greater mobility than those in oil-free rubber and
can change their position/orientation and thus three-dimensional (3D)
connectivity and corresponding electrical conductivity during tensile
deformation. In this scenario, the nanofibers generally become more
connected as the CPN is uniaxially strained to yield a reduction in
electrical resistance (and a corresponding increase in conductance).
As time (or strain) increases prior to strain reversal at 10% during
each strain cycle in which the CPN is stretched at 20 mm/min, the
resistance suddenly, but not completely, reverses due to a loss of
CNF connectivity as the nanofibers change their position and/or orientation
upon further strain. The abruptness of this change in resistance resembles
a rheological slip encountered67 in filled
polymers during shear deformation. As the strain continues, alternating,
but often short-lived, fluctuations in resistance continue until the
maximum strain (at 10%) is reached. Beyond this point, the CPN is
allowed to relax as the load is gradually released and the fluctuations
in resistance (which generally increases) remain but are less pronounced
and regular. This behavior manifested during the first strain cycle
is retained during the last strain cycle, but an increase in crosshead
speed to 100 mm/min completely eliminates these fluctuations in Figure 6c. If the strain
amplitude is increased to 20% in Figure 7c, the fluctuations become more stochastic
and the net reduction in resistance prior to strain reversal appears
delayed at 20 mm/min. Even the results acquired at 100 mm/min signify
the presence of resistance fluctuations due to nanofiber rearrangement.
Thus, although TPEGs exhibit relatively negligible mechanical hysteresis
(low irrecoverable strain or set) upon strain cycling,56 incorporated conductive nanofillers retain unexpectedly
high mobility, which serves to deteriorate the quality of the electrical
signal.

In marked contrast, the piezoresistance results included
for the TPE-based CPNs in Figures 8 and 9 verify highly stable
signal quality, as well as the existence of strain-induced reversible
piezoresistivity. At 20% strain in Figure 8a (20 mm/min) and 8b (100 mm/min), the average values of the measured maximum and minimum
resistance are 30.4 ± 0.3 and 12.1 ± 0.3 kΩ, respectively,
at 20 mm/min and 39.9 ± 0.3 and 15.2 ± 0.3 kΩ, respectively,
at 100 mm/min. These results confirm much less signal variation than
that observed at the same strain amplitude for the TPEG in Figure 7a,b. If the strain
amplitude is increased to 50% in Figure 9a,b, the extent to which the maximum and
minimum resistance values vary clearly increases: 97.8 ± 6.6
and 28.4 ± 0.7 kΩ, respectively, at 20 mm/min and 216 ±
16 and 52.0 ± 4.7 kΩ, respectively, at 100 mm/min. The
single-cycle measurements presented in Figure 8c for 20% strain and 9c for 50% strain reveal two important characteristics. The first
is that, at 20 mm/min, results from the first and last cycle are nearly
indistinguishable, thereby indicating virtually no electrical hysteresis.
At 100 mm/min, the resistance at the point of strain reversal decreases
noticeably upon strain cycling. This observation provides indirect
evidence that either the CNF permanently changes its position upon
cycling or the cycling occurs too fast to permit the CNF to return
to its original position (and resistance level). The second noteworthy
feature is that, in all cases, the resistance initially decreases,
exhibits a minimum, and then increases prior to strain reversal. We
have previously described10 such strain-reversible
piezoresistivity in terms of three distinct stages of strain-induced
changes in CNF percolation due to CNF rotation/straightening and translation
along the strain axis.

Figure 8 Cyclic electromechanical measurements presented as a function
of time (or, alternatively, cyclic strain) for CPNs composed of TPE/CNF
and exposed to 20% strain at two different stretch rates (in mm/min):
(a) 20 and (b) 100. In (c), results are displayed as a function of
time normalized with respect to the time of a single cycle and correspond
to the first and final cycles (solid and dotted lines, respectively)
from tests performed at 20 (black) and 100 (red) mm/min. The dashed
line (labeled) identifies the normalized time (at 0.5) corresponding
to strain reversal.

Figure 9 Cyclic electromechanical
measurements presented as a function of time (or, alternatively, cyclic
strain) for CPNs composed of TPE/CNF and exposed to 50% strain at
two different stretch rates (in mm/min): (a) 20 and (b) 100. In (c),
results are displayed as a function of time normalized with respect
to the time of a single cycle and correspond to the first and final
cycles (solid and dotted lines, respectively) from tests performed
at 20 (black) and 100 (red) mm/min. The dashed line (labeled) identifies
the normalized time (at 0.5) corresponding to strain reversal.

In stage I, uniaxial strain induces
a corresponding reduction in the cross-sectional area of the CPN normal
to the strain axis (since the deformation is considered to be isochoric).
By doing so, the randomly oriented nanofibers embedded in the polymeric
matrix begin to straighten, rotate and align along the strain axis
as the glassy micelles formed by the copolymer continue to serve as
physical cross-links to stabilize the TPE matrix. During this typically
observed electromechanical process, the 3D connectivity of the nanofibers
and, consequently, the conductivity of the CPN concurrently increases
so that the measured resistance decreases, resulting in negative piezoresistivity.
When the strain level reaches a critical value at stage II, however,
the extent of CNF connectivity becomes briefly independent of strain.
Once the CPN enters stage III, the nanofibers in contact separate
due to increased distance along the strain axis, thereby lowering
the overall conductivity of the CPN and promoting positive piezoresistivity.
Such strain-reversible piezoresistivity is qualitatively consistent
with prior reports,68−70 revealing that the maximum conductivity in thermoplastic
CPNs containing CNTs occurs at intermediate alignment levels. The
unexpected and remarkable aspect of Figures 8c and 9c is that all
three stages associated with strain-reversible piezoresistivity are
clearly delineated at both of the strain and elongation rate levels
examined for the first and final strain cycles.

Conclusions
Soft
strain sensors are of growing technological interest in the fabrication
of portable healthcare products and wearable electronic devices. In
this study, we have examined the morphological, mechanical, electrical,
and electromechanical properties of conductive polymer nanocomposites
composed of carbon nanofibers embedded in either a neat TPE or an
oil-swollen TPEG. Comparison of SEM images acquired from representative
specimens confirms that the nanofibers expectedly increase in both
population density and local correlation as the nanofiber loading
level is increased. As expected, this increase in nanofiber content
is accompanied by increases in tensile modulus and electrical conductivity.
One distinguishing characteristic differentiates the two nanocomposite
series: the one with a TPE matrix exhibits a well-defined percolation
threshold, whereas the one with a TPEG matrix does not. This behavior
is reflected in profound differences between the electromechanical
properties of the two series. Although TPEGs are capable of withstanding
continuous strain cycling with relatively little mechanical hysteresis
or evidence of fatigue, their generally negative piezoresistive properties
display significant fluctuations, especially at high strain amplitudes
and low stretch rates, due to strain-induced repositioning and reorientation
of the conductive nanofibers, which are less spatially restricted
(i.e., mobile) due to the presence of liquid oil. At high stretch
rates, the degree of such fluctuations is substantially reduced. In
the presence of the neat TPE, however, clearly defined strain-reversible
piezoresistance is manifested at all strain amplitudes and stretch
rates. In this case, electrical resistance initially decreases and
then switches and increases prior to strain reversal during strain
cycling. At low elongation rates, resistance measurements collected
from the first and last strain cycles are nearly indistinguishable,
thereby indicating that such materials constitute excellent candidates
for strain sensors capable of high sensitivity and repeatability.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Two poly[styrene-b-(ethylene-co-butylene)-b-styrene] (SEBS) triblock
copolymers were employed in this work. The first (SEBS1, Taipol 6151)
obtained from TSRC/DEXCO was a conventional TPE with 32 wt % S and
a number-average molecular weight (Mn)
of 186 kDa (Đ = 1.05), according to inhouse
gel permeation chromatography performed on a Viscotek Max System.
The second (SEBS2, Tuftec H1221) with Mn = 55 kDa Đ = 1.08) was provided by Asahi
KASEI and possessed a much lower S content (12 wt %). An aliphatic
white mineral oil with a molecular weight of 567 Da and reagent-grade
toluene were purchased from Petroyag Lubricants A.S. and Merck, respectively,
and used as-received. Vapor-grown CNF measuring 130 nm on average
in diameter and 20–200 μm in length was obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich.

Methods
The CPN films examined here
were produced according to a three-step mixing procedure. In the first
step, either the SEBS1 copolymer containing 70 wt % mineral oil or
the SEBS2 copolymer without mineral oil was dissolved in toluene for
12 h under agitation at ambient temperature. In the second step, a
suspension of CNF in toluene was prepared by adding a predetermined
mass of CNF to 10 g of toluene and then subjecting the mixture to
high shear in a Kurabo-Mazerustar KK250 planetary mixer for 90 s.
In the final mixing step, the polymer solution was added to the suspension
and shear-mixed for an additional 90 s. The resultant suspensions
were cast into a Petri dish and dried under vacuum for 12 h at 50 °C.
Dried films were melt-pressed at 190 °C for 15 min (TPEG) or
180 °C for 3 min (TPE) to a thickness of 0.8–0.9 mm. Specimens
from both CPN series selected for examination by SEM were cryofractured
in liquid nitrogen prior to mounting. Images of uncoated CNFs and
CPNs were obtained on a field-emission JEOL JSM-6400 electron microscope
(Middle East Technical University) and an ultrahigh-resolution FEI
Verios 460L Schottkey emitter electron microscope (North Carolina
State University), respectively, both operated at an accelerating
voltage of 20 kV. Quasistatic uniaxial tensile strain analysis of
the CPNs was performed on a Devotrans DVT universal load frame. For
each CPN, three rectangular specimens measuring 25 mm × 5 mm
were cut from larger films and tested to determine the nominal (engineering)
stress as a function of true tensile strain.

The volume resistivity
of each CPN was determined with a Keithley model 6517B electrometer
and model 8009 resistivity chamber in accordance with the ASTM D257
standard. Before conducting the electrical measurements, specimen
thicknesses were discerned using an Asimeto digital thickness meter.
At least five measurements were collected so that average and standard
error values could be calculated. To determine the piezoresistive
behavior of the CPNs in the longitudinal direction (parallel to the
applied strain), specimens measuring 80 mm × 25 mm were attached
to four electrical leads spaced 10 mm apart along the centerline of
the specimen parallel to the longitudinal direction. The leads were
adhered to each CPN surface with a conductive adhesive containing
40 wt % CB prepared for this purpose. Test specimens were clamped
on a customized load frame having the gauge length set at 50 mm and
subsequently cycled to 10–50% strain amplitudes at elongation
rates of 20 and 100 mm/min to ascertain the effects of strain and
stretch rate. Dynamic resistance measurements were simultaneously
conducted using a computer-controlled setup consisting of a current
source (Keithley 6221) and a nanovoltmeter (Keithley 2182A) under
an input current of 1 μA. Resistance was recorded as a function
of time, and all CPNs in each series were evaluated for at least 10
continuous loading/unloading cycles at a constant crosshead speed.

a While mixing rules can be written in many different functional
forms, the most successful one employed here is a linear rule given
by ln Ec = (ϕ/100) ln Ef + (1 – ϕ/100) ln Ep, where the subscripts c, f, and p refer to
the nanocomposite, CNF, and polymer, respectively. We elect not to
use this expression, however, since the extracted values of Ef are inconsistent, varying by orders of magnitude,
between the TPE and TPEG datasets. We note that the value of Ef discerned from the TPE tensile data (∼93
GPa) is most similar to that reported for CNF in the literature (ranging
from about 25 GPa in ref (59) to about 50 GPa in ref (60)).

b Application
of the Cox model described in ref (61) to the two tensile datasets in Figure 4c suggests
that the aspect ratio of the CNF in the TPE is significantly smaller
(<40) than that in the TPEG (>100). If real, the most likely
cause for such a difference is the mechanical mixing employed to disperse
the CNF since the TPE possesses a higher melt viscosity.
