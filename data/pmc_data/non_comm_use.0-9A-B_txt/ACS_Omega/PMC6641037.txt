1 Introduction
The
chromone core is a ubiquitous heterocycle present in many natural
bioactive products, and it represents an important “privileged
scaffold”.1 Numerous types of biological
activities are associated with simple chromones and analogues, including
anti-inflammatory, antiplatelet, anticancer, anti-HIV, immune-stimulatory,
anti-Alzheimer, and antimicrobial.1,2 Several commercially
available drugs have the chromone moiety in their core structure,
for example, khelline (used in folk medicines), Rapitil (for asthma
and allergic eye reactions), and Intal (for asthma) (Figure 1).3 Several promising radioiodinated styrylchromone
derivatives have been used as probes for imaging because of the fluorescence
of the core structure.4Hence, considering
their structural diversity, biological properties, and synthetic utility,
these structures have received considerable attention.1,5

Figure 1 Chromone-based
drugs.

Analogously, the construction
of the C–S/Se bond is a very
important transformation in organic synthesis, as these compounds
exhibit fascinating biological characteristics.6 In the past few decades, these compounds have gained increasing
interest, mainly because of their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,
antitumor, and antiviral activities.6,7 They also play
a fundamental role in modern organic synthesis and are employed as
catalysts, ligands, and ionic liquids in certain reactions and as
synthetic intermediates in total synthesis.8,9 In
addition, they are applied in asymmetric catalysis and in materials
science.10

Despite the biological
importance of organochalcogen compounds
and the wide spectrum of therapeutic properties of chromones, only
a few synthetic methods for the construction of these hybrid structures
in a single molecule, 3-chalcogenayl-4H-chromen-4-ones,
have been reported.11

Zeni and co-workers
have reported the synthesis of selenylated
chromones from the reaction of alkynyl aryl ketones and diselenides
in the presence of 1.5 equiv of FeCl3 (Scheme 1a).11a Recently, Blond and co-workers have demonstrated the AgOTf-mediated
synthesis of chromone containing the phenylselenyl moiety through
the reaction of 2-hydroxy-phenyl enaminones and phenylselenyl chloride
(Scheme 1b).11e The common approach to access sulfenylated
chromones is through the direct sulfenylation of the C–H bond
of chromones using different sources of organosulfur and 2–4
molar equiv of NH4I (Scheme 1c).11b−11d During the preparation of this manuscript,
a related study using aryl thiols as a sulfenylating agent and 0.3
molar equiv of KIO3 to produce sulfenylated chromones in
ethyl lactate as the solvent appeared in the literature (Scheme 1d).11f

Scheme 1 Synthetic Routes for Chalcogenated Chromones
Some of the methods described
in the literature are associated
with limitations that reduce their synthetic utility. These downsides
include the use of nongreen solvents, prefunctionalized coupling partners,
low atom economy, narrow substrate scope, the use of transition metal
salts, malodorous reagents, and elaborate, multistep processes.

In recent years, various types of organic transformations have
been carried out with the application of metal- and solvent-free systems.12

An alternative greener method with a broad
scope for the synthesis
of these compounds, involving a solvent- and metal-free system that
could provide high efficiency, would be advantageous and highly desirable
in view of the significance of chalcogenated chromones. As part of
our wider research program aimed at designing and developing sustainable
processes and solvent-free systems for the chalcogenation of heteroarenes
and organochalcogen chemistry,13 herein,
we report, for the first time, the KIO3/glycerol catalytic
system for the synthesis of C-3 chalcogenated chromones (Scheme 1e). Our new regioselective,
broader, metal-, and solvent-free approach worked effectively using
enaminones with a half-molar equivalent of diorganyl diselenides or
disulfides as a nonmalodorous source of chalcogens, in the presence
of catalytic loading of KIO3 (15 mol %).

2 Results and Discussion
To identify the best reaction conditions,
enaminone 1a and diphenyl diselenide 2a were
selected as model substrates.
These were then evaluated under various conditions (Table 1).

yields.

c Reaction under argon
atmosphere.

d 2 mL glycerol.

On the basis of our previous
experience of solvent-free systems,13a−13d preliminary experiments were
carried out in the presence of a stoichiometric
amount of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-400) as an additive at 110 °C
with a reaction time of 10 h and without a catalyst. The reaction
under open air (entry 1) and under inert atmosphere (entry 2) conditions
was unsuccessful. When the reaction was performed in the presence
of 20 mol % of CuI as the transition metal catalyst, 3a was formed in trace amounts (entry 3), whereas the use of ZnI2 was completely ineffective (entry 4). When the reaction was
carried out in the presence of KI as the catalyst, the desired product
was obtained in 10% yield (entry 5). On switching from KI to KIO3, 3a was isolated with a 61% yield (entry 6)
but its sodium analogue gave the selenylated product with a 35% yield
(entry 7). Molecular iodine was also not effective and afforded 3a with a 38% yield (entry 8).

After determining the
appropriate catalyst, in the next step, the
type of additive was screened for this transformation (entries 9–12).
Ethyl lactate promoted some improvement in the reaction (entry 9),
and this motivated us to test other greener additives. With the use
of glycerol, 3a was isolated with an 86% yield (entry
10). An adverse effect on the yield was noted when dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO) was used (entry 11), whereas toluene afforded 3a in traces (entry 12).

Subsequently, the catalyst loading,
reaction time, and temperature
were screened for this transformation (entries 13–18). Lowering
the catalyst loading to 15 mol % did not affect the yield of 3a (entry 13 vs 10). Further decreasing the catalyst quantity
to 10 mol % resulted in a lower yield of 3a (entry 14).
The reaction temperature and time were screened for this transformation
(entries 15–17), and ideal values of 100 °C and 8 h were
obtained.

The use of glycerol (2 mL) as the solvent did not
provide any further
positive influence on the yield of 3a (entry 20 vs 17).
Decreasing the quantity of glycerol to 3 molar equiv afforded 3a with a lower yield (entry 19).

With the optimized
conditions in hand (Table 1, entry 17), the applicability of other enaminones 1 and various diorganyl dichalcogenides was investigated (Schemes 2–4). We first evaluated the efficiency
and generality of this method with respect to different diorganyl
diselenides 2 while keeping enaminone 1a constant (Scheme 2).

Scheme 4 Thiolation Using Arylsulfonyl Hydrazides 6
The reaction worked effectively
for structurally diverse diselenides 2. Substituents
on the aryl moiety, that is, electron-donating
(R = F, Cl, and CF3) and electron-withdrawing (R = Me and
OMe) groups and a bulky group (naphthyl) successfully afforded the
corresponding products 3a–i in good
to excellent yields (70–90%; 3a–i). The course of the reaction appears to be influenced by electronic
effects. It can be noted that diaryl diselenides with electron-donating
groups usually gave the selenylated products (3b–c) in better yields than those achieved with electron-withdrawing
groups (3d–f). Furthermore, steric hindrance of
the ortho-substituted aryl substrates showed a weaker influence on
the yields in relation to the corresponding para-derivatives (3b–c vs 3g–h). However, product 3i was obtained in 70% yield when a fused aromatic substrate
(R = naphthyl) was used.

C-2 heteroaryl diselenide 2j afforded the desired
product 3j with a 73% yield. Aliphatic diorganyl diselenides 2k and 2l furnished the respective selenylated
chromones 3k and 3l in 52 and 39% yields,
respectively. 3l was observed when benzylic diselenide
was used as the substrate.

The success observed for the KIO3-catalyzed synthesis
of selenylated chromones 3 prompted us to expand the
scope of this method to access sulfenylated chromones 5 using diorganyl disulfides 4 as the coupling partner
(Scheme 3). The desired
products 5a–g were obtained in 44–85% yields.
Using diphenyl disulfide 4a as the substrate, the sulfenylated
product 5a was obtained in 82% yield. It was noted that
the method used to prepare the sulfenylated product 5 from disulfides 4 presented electronic and steric effects
similar to that used for diorganyl diselenides 2. There
was a small decrease in the product yields of sulfenylated compound 5 compared with selenylated analogue 3, which
can probably be attributed to the stronger S–S bond of the
diaryl disulfides in relation to the respective diselendies 2.

We then extended our study to sulfonyl hydrazides 6 (Scheme 4), applying
the optimal reaction conditions (Table 1, entry 17), to explore the scope of this new methodology.
The protocol described herein is versatile, being applicable to different
types of organochalcogen sources. For instance, the reaction of different
arylsulfonyl hydrazides 6 with enaminone 1a afforded the corresponding coupled products 5a and 5b in isolated yields of 71 and 73%, respectively (Scheme 4).

To broaden
the scope of the optimized reaction in relation to the
substrate, the influence of the enaminone 1 moiety was
evaluated with 2a and 4a (Scheme 5). Enaminone 1 with different functional groups attached at the aryl moiety, for
example, alkyl, alkoxy, halogen, and naphthyl groups, were tested.
The system tolerated the electronic effects of the substituents on
the phenyl group, and both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating
groups are suitable substrates, affording the corresponding products 7a–l and 7aa–al in 70–88%
yields. In this case, the electron-donating groups (−Me, −MeO,
and −EtO) showed superiority over electron-withdrawing groups
(−F, Cl, and Br). Furthermore, the reaction tolerated disubstituted
substrates, furnishing the respective product in good to excellent
yields. Similarly, a fused aromatic substrate (naphthyl) resulted
in the desired products 7m and 7am in 80
and 76% yields, respectively.

Scheme 5 Scope of Enaminones 1
Isolated yield.

In general, we observed that diselenides 2a furnished
the targeted selenylated products 7a–m in slightly
better yields compared with disulfides 4a.

On the
basis of reports in the literature11 and
the chemical shifts observed from the nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) (1H and 13C) spectra of each of the chalcogenated
chromone derivatives (3, 8), all products
have an organochalcogen moiety bonded at the α-positions of
the ketone functions of the chromones.

In view of the unique
features of the KIO3-catalyzed
one-pot cyclization of enaminones and chalcogenation in the presence
of dichalcogenide, we decided to investigate the mode of action. Some
control experiments were therefore conducted (Scheme 6). The addition of a stoichiometric amount
of TEMPO, as a radical inhibitor, did not hamper the reaction, and
the selenylated product 3a was obtained in 81% yield
(Scheme 6a), which
excluded the possibility of a radical pathway. While under an inert
atmosphere, the standard reaction shows a decrease in the efficacy
(Scheme 6b), indicating
that the presence of oxygen is important for this transformation.
In agreement with that, the reaction under oxygen atmosphere exhibited
some improvement in the isolated yield of 3a (Scheme 6c), indicating the
importance of oxygen in the reaction medium. When (E)-3-(dimethylamino)-1-phenylprop-2-en-1-one 8 was used
instead of enaminone 1a under standard conditions for 2a and 4a, the expected chalcogenated enaminone 9 was not observed (Scheme 6d). Thus, apparently, the hydroxy group of enaminones
plays a key role in the reaction. Subsequently, the reaction in the
absence of dichalcogenides furnished the chromone in a low yield (Scheme 6e), signifying that
most likely it is not the intermediate in our reaction. Additionally,
chromone 10 itself, under optimized conditions, provided
the desired products in low yields (Scheme 6f). The presence of DABCO (as base) did not
hamper the reaction, and product 3a was obtained in 82%
yield (Scheme 6g).
This result indicates that most likely the reaction did not involve
any active iodine acid species (such as HI) during the catalytic pathway,
as previously observed.13a−13c

Scheme 6 Control Experiments
On the basis of these results
and of previous reports,13,14a a mechanism for this
transformation can be proposed (Scheme 7). Initially, the reaction
between diorganyl dichalcogenide and enaminone 1 would
form species (A) and organochalcogenyl anion, which would suffer oxidation
by air and regenerate the dichalcogenide. The species (A) would afford
the cyclic intermediate (C) through the intramolecular cyclization
from the tautomeric intermediate (B). Subsequently, the elimination
of dimethylamine from the intermediate (C) would furnish the desired
chalcogenated chromone.

Scheme 7 Proposed Mechanism for the Reaction
3 Conclusions
We developed a KIO3-catalyzed, simple, greener, metal-,
and solvent-free approach for the preparation of 3-selenyl- and 3-sulfenyl-chromones,
a class of compounds of interest for therapeutic applications. Under
optimized reaction conditions, the reaction worked well in the presence
of KIO3/glycerol, as a nontoxic catalytic system, with
2-hydroxy-phenylenaminones and a half molar equivalent of diorganyl
dichalcogenides as an odorless source of chalcogens. This afforded
a wide range of chalcogenated (S, Se) chromones at the C3 position
in good to excellent yields. The optimized reaction conditions were
appropriate for various substituents with different electronic and
steric effects. Furthermore, sulfonyl hydrazides were also successfully
applied as alternative sulfenylating agents.

The important features
of this robust and benign protocol are as
follows: (1) it is metal-free and solvent-free; (2) it is performed
open air; (3) it is atom-economic, (4) regioselective, and (5) inexpensive;
(6) it is a nontoxic catalytic system with (7) a low catalytic loading;
and (8) it is applicable to different sources of organochalcogenides
and a wide range of enaminones.
