An efficient, convenient, and selective
Lewis acid-based strategy
for on-resin deprotection of the side chain tert-butyl-protected
aspartic acid and glutamic acid of a peptide is achieved. The method
is mild, cost-effective, and Fmoc chemistry compatible and allows
on-resin incorporation of amides, esters, and thioesters in good yield.
This method will find wide applicability in peptide and protein modification

Introduction
Post-translational
modification of protein, including phosphorylation,
glycosylation, methylation, and lipidation, is a common phenomenon
in a biosystem.1 Chemical modification
of amino acids in peptides and proteins is essential and attractive
for tuning selectivity and efficiency of drugs and understanding the
molecular mechanism of their actions.2 Furthermore,
site-specific introduction of biochemically active probes, such as
a fluorescence probe or a high UV/visible absorbent, on peptides is
often needed for monitoring protein conformation,3 structural analyses,4 and reducing
immunogenicity. Such chemical modifications are possible by labeling
or tagging a suitable moiety at the side chain functionality of amino
acids (aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), lysine (Lys), serine
(Ser), etc.) in solution or via solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS)
technology.5 For example, cysteine and
lysine side chain modifications by installation of various electrophiles
are well-known.6

SPPS technology
is preferred over the synthesis in solution mainly
to avoid chromatographic purification at each step among other operational
advantages. Usually, Fmoc/tert-butyl (tBu) orthogonal protection technique-based SPPS is preferred over
the tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc)/benzyl (Bzl) strategy
to avoid highly corrosive trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) at each step
of Boc deprotection and the extremely dangerous hydrofluoric acid
for the final cleavage of the peptide from the solid support.7,8 On-resin site-specific peptide modification demands a third degree
of orthogonality (terminal amine/side chain/resin). For example, benzyloxycarbonyl
(Cbz)-protected Lys and Bzl-protected Asp or Glu, both at side chain,
can be safely modified during Fmoc/tBu-based SPPS,
as Cbz/Bzl can be removed using Pd-catalyzed hydrogenation9 keeping both base-labile Fmoc and acid-labile tBu/resin unaffected. However, side chain Bzl-protected
Asp/Glu is at a risk of formation of not only aspartimide/glutamide
peptides and piperidine derivatives but also 1,4-diazepine-2,5-dione-peptides,
making the purification difficult and resulting in yield reduction.10 Similarly, Alloc/Allyl groups can be cleaved
easily using excess phenylsilane and catalytic amount of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0)
[Pd(PPh3)4] under an inert atmosphere11 and subsequently modified suitably.

Although
efficient, this method is highly reagent-intensive and
failure of complete oxygen removal may poison the palladium catalyst,
leading to undesirable side reactions.12 The 4-{N-[1-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohexylidene)-3-methylbutyl]amino}benzyl
ester (Dmab)13 group was introduced in
1995 as an orthogonal protecting group in Fmoc/tBu
chemistry to overcome the mentioned problems. Dmab contains the 1-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohexylidene)-3-methylbutyl
group, which can be removed using 2% hydrazine within a second, but
removal of the remaining aminobenzyl ester part is very slow. Payne
et al. noticed that removal of the Dmab group from a resin-bound peptide
needed 12 h in the presence of hydrazine and 20% N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) in 9:1 (v/v) dimethylformamide
(DMF)/H2O; however, in the presence of 5 mM NaOH, 3 h reaction
time was enough.14 Ruczyński et
al. observed that whereas side chain Dmab-protected Asp resulted in
72% aspartimide, 27% aspartyl methyl ester, and 12% aspartyl peptide, tBu-protected Asp yielded 100% aspartimide-free peptide.15 Similarly, Johnson et al. reported that pyroglutamide
formation is more during the elongation of the peptide sequence in
the presence of Dmab-protected Glu, whereas tBu-protected
Glu did not produce the same.16 They also
observed a side reaction due to slow 1,6 elimination of the 4-aminobenzyl
ester group during hydrazine treatment. McMurray et al. introduced
2,4-dimethoxybenzyl (Dmb) group for on-resin head-to-tail cyclization.17 Dmb can be removed in the presence of 1% TFA
for 30 min, but a less-acid-sensitive TFA/phenol (95:5, overnight)-cleavable
aminomethylated polystyrene or a similar resin is required. Even the
Fmoc/Fm group can be used for selective side chain modification, but
this can be used only in Boc/Bzl-based SPPS.8 All of the three-dimensional orthogonal protection strategies have
their own advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, development of
a milder, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly method for
the purpose is the need of the hour.

Most of the mentioned suitably
protected Asp or Glu derivatives
are either unavailable or costly. Therefore, we wanted to use relatively
cheap and readily available Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH or
Fmoc-Glu(OtBu)-OH for on-resin peptide modification
compatible to environmentally friendly Fmoc/tBu chemistry.
The tBu group is a widely used acid-labile protecting
group, which is usually cleaved during the final cleavage of the peptide
from the resin by TFA.18 It can also be
deprotected in the presence of protic acids, including HCl,19 H2SO4,20 HNO3,21 TFA,22 Lewis acids, for example; TiCl4;23 silyl triflates;24 ZnBr2 in CH2Cl2;25 and CeCl3·7H2O–NaI in
acetonitrile.26 Most of these methods suffer
from many disadvantages, including long reaction time, unsatisfactory
yields, etc., and thus are not compatible to SPPS. More recently,
Martín and Padrón et al.27 reported removal of the Boc group from N,N′-protected amino
acids and amines using ferric chloride (FeCl3), which provided
good yield (Scheme 1). However, these methods are restricted to solution-phase chemistry
only. Also, the resins used for Fmoc chemistry are acid-labile. Therefore,
selective removal of the tert-butyl group keeping
the peptide intact on the resin is a challenge. We disclose herein
an efficient environmentally friendly FeCl3-based method
that can be applied on both the solution phase and Fmoc/tBu-based SPPS for side chain carboxylic acid group deprotection of
Asp or Glu and subsequent modification, keeping the peptide intact
on resin, including a commonly used methylbenzhydrylamine linker.
The advantage of using FeCl3 in solid-phase tert-butyl ester hydrolysis is that it gives the desired product within
1.5 h and it can be easily removed from the resin by washing with
DMF among others.

Scheme 1 Overview of the Work
Results and Discussion
Optimization of the Cleavage Condition
To optimize
the reaction conditions, we took Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OMe
(A) as a model substrate along with various Lewis acids
and solvents (Table 1). The isolated yield of the deprotected product increased, and the
reaction time decreased gradually with an increment of the amount
of FeCl3 used (entries 1–6, Table 1). FeCl3 (1.5 equiv) produced
80% (isolated by column chromatography) of the deprotected product
at room temperature (rt) in dichloromethane (DCM), and this condition
was accepted as optimum for reactions in solution.

The reaction worked well in acetonitrile also, but
5 equiv of FeCl3 and 6 h time were required. No deprotection
was observed
till 72 h in DMF, THF, and methanol; the starting material was recovered
back instead. Whereas ZnBr2 and ZnCl2 provided
comparative yields at a longer reaction time (24 and 72 h, respectively,
entries 11 and 12, Table 1), CuCl2 did not react till 72 h (entry 13, Table 1).

Compatibility
with Other Protecting Groups
We found
that 1.5 equiv of FeCl3 selectively removed tBu from A in the optimized condition without affecting
the methyl group (Table 2, a preliminary time-dependent high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) analysis revealed the time of conversion of half of the substrate
to be approximately 6–7 min; Figures S1–S7, Supporting Information). In similar experiments, the benzyl
derivative of A (Fmoc-Asp(OBzl)-OMe (C), Figures S8–S12, Supporting Information), allyl ester of benzoic acid (allyl benzoate (D), Figures S13–S17, Supporting Information), and ethyl ester of benzoic acid (ethyl benzoate (E), Figures S18–S23, Supporting Information) were unaltered till 12 h. We also monitored the stability of other
acid-sensitive protecting groups, for example, Trt and Pbf, by HPLC
and observed that the Trt group got cleaved, whereas Pbf was intact
(Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH (F), Figures S24–S28 and Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH (G), Figures S29–S34, Supporting Information). Such HPLC analyses
revealed that some protecting groups, such as Bzl, Cbz, All, Alloc,
Pbf, ortho-nitrobenzenesulfonyl (o-NBS), Fmoc, Me, and Et are orthogonal to the tBu
group with respect to the FeCl3-based cleavage condition.
These groups can be used as side chain-protecting groups for suitable
amino acids while applying the FeCl3-based cleavage condition
during SPPS. Thus, this method indeed opens up a new avenue for orthogonal
peptide modification, as desired. However, acid-sensitive groups,
such as Boc (for, e.g., lysine), Trt (for O/N/S protection), and tert-butyl ethers (for serine, threonine, and tyrosine),
do not resist the reaction conditions under which a tert-butyl ester is cleaved. On the other hand, the FeCl3-based
condition can be applied for on-resin cleavage of the mentioned acid-labile
groups in the case of Rink amide resin.

Racemization Study
Next, we synthesized dl-Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OMe and l-Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OMe. Then, we applied our hydrolysis protocol on them
and checked HPLC profiles of the products. dl-Fmoc-Asp(OH)-OMe
exhibited two distinct peaks with retention times 17.45 and 20.57
min in HPLC (chiral column, isocratic gradient of 15% 2-propanol in
hexane till 40 min), indicating the presence of two enantiomers. However, l-Fmoc-Asp(OH)-OMe exhibited a single peak at 20.83 min, indicating
the presence of a single enantiomer (Figure 1). Comparison of these HPLC profiles indicated
no detectable racemization caused by this method for enantiomerically
pure substrates.

(left) and l-Fmoc-Asp-OMe (right).

Introduction of Other Groups after Removal of tBu
in SPPS
Next, we synthesized a broad range of model peptides
containing various amino acid residues, including side chain tert-butyl ester-protected aspartic acid (Table 3). These peptides are regarded
as synthetically difficult peptides as hydrophobic stretches in them
are at a risk of on-resin aggregation32 but were important for our anti-Alzheimer’s drug design endeavor.33

After stepwise
synthesis of the whole peptide by the conventional
method using (benzotriazole-1-yloxy) tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium
hexafluorophosphate (BOP) as the coupling reagent following the Fmoc/tBu orthogonal protection7 technique
on the Rink amide AM resin (loading 0.7 mmol/g), the N-terminus of
the peptides was acetylated using acetic anhydride and N-methyl morpholine. Then, tBu was removed using
FeCl3 (5 equiv; excess reagent was used to facilitate SPPS)
in dichloromethane on-resin for 1.5 h from the side chain of the aspartic
acid. After that, esterification, thioesterification, or amidation
was performed in the presence of BOP (2.5 equiv), DIPEA (5 equiv),
and the corresponding alcohol, thiol, or amine (3 equiv) (Scheme 2), respectively,
on-resin.

Scheme 2 tert-Butyl Ester Hydrolysis and Side
Chain Modification
on a Solid Phase
After completion of the synthesis, the peptides (Table 3) were cleaved from
the resin,
precipitated from cold ether, and dried. The obtained crude powder
was subjected to HPLC analysis. Integration of the peak corresponding
to the desired peptide represents its relative abundance with respect
to the associated impurities (reported in Table 3 as spectroscopic yield). This is very important
in peptide chemistry as it is related to the ease of chromatographic
purification and efficiency of synthesis. Crude peptide mixtures were
purified by preparative HPLC. White fluffy powders were obtained after
lyophilization, and the isolated yields of purified products were
calculated from them (reported in Table 3 as isolated yield).

The isolated peptides
were characterized by mass spectrometry and
one-dimensional (1D) [1H] and two-dimensional (2D) [1H, 1H] NMR spectroscopy. The variable-temperature-dependent 1H NMR experiments revealed that the chemical shift values
of the amide-NHs were shifted during increment of temperature from
25 to 60 °C, which confirmed the position of the amide-NHs and
the aromatic protons. The coexistence of the phenylalanine residue
together with the benzylated thioester of the aspartic acid residue
was clearly observed in the NMR spectra of 4 (Figure 2, a representative
example). Aromatic protons of the side chain-protected thioester of
aspartic acid resonated at 7.28 ppm, and benzylic SCH2 protons
resonated at 4.13 ppm, whereas phenylalanine aromatic protons resonated
at 7.19–7.15 ppm. Different amino acid residues and their 2D
interactions could be identified easily from the 2D total correlation
spectroscopy (TOCSY) and nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy
(NOESY) spectra, respectively.

sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6. (b) Variable-temperature 1H NMR spectra, showing temperature-dependent amide-NH chemical
shifts. (c) Two-dimensional TOCSY spectra, indicating the location
of different amino acids. (d) Two-dimensional NOESY spectra, correlations
between NH and aliphatic protons of amino acid residues.

Next, we wanted to verify whether the acid-cleavable
resin (Rink
amide) would be cleaved by FeCl3, which is also acidic
in nature. For this, we synthesized a peptide (7, Supporting Information, p 10) that contains the
same amino acid sequence as that of 3, except Fmoc-Asp(OBzl)-OH
was used instead of Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH. Peptide 7 serves as a reference because Asp(OBzl)-OH was incorporated
directly, not from Asp(OtBu)-OH, whereas in the case
of peptide 3, the cyclohexyl amine group was inserted
after tBu cleavage from preinserted Asp(OtBu)-OH. After the final cleavage, yields (both spectroscopic
and isolated) of 3 and 7 were comparable.
This indicates that no considerable loss of peptide occurred due to
FeCl3 treatment and subsequent modification. Furthermore,
we analyzed the washing mixture after FeCl3 treatment but
could not find any trace of the cleaved peptide in it. Therefore,
we concluded that the Rink amide resin was not cleaved by FeCl3 treatment.

Compatibility with Other Protecting Groups
in SPPS
An attractive feature of this protocol is its compatibility
to various
side chain-protecting groups (Table 2) that are frequently used in Fmoc-based SPPS. To verify
this, a model peptide (8, Scheme 3) containing some of those protecting groups
was synthesized and then we applied our method for removal of tert-butyl from Asp, followed by incorporation of an important
cyclopropylamine34 moiety onto it on a
solid support. Analysis after cleavage of the peptide from the solid
support revealed that the All, Alloc, o-NBs, and
Fmoc groups remained unchanged. In peptide 8, we attached
the side chain carboxylic acid group of the first Asp to the Rink
amide resin to selectively address each of the Asp residue present
in it after cleavage from the resin.

Scheme 3 Model Peptide Containing
Various Protecting Groups during SPPS
One of the advantages of this new strategy is that it
enables introduction
of multiple groups at the side chains of the tert-butyl ester-protected aspartic acids or glutamic acids directly
on a peptidic resin. After introducing one substituent onto the first
aspartic acid or glutamic acid, the peptide chain can be elongated
and a second substituent can be introduced onto another aspartic or
glutamic acid residue. We chose a partial sequence of the α-synuclein
peptide, that is, α-synuclein (110–115), to demonstrate
this. The α-synuclein peptide is known as the main culprit for
Parkinson’s disease and also belongs to the class of difficult
sequences. We synthesized a model peptide containing a thioester,
an amide, and an ester group on two glutamic acids and an aspartic
acid, respectively, all on-resin (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Esterification/Thioesterification
and Amidation Reaction Performed
on α-Synuclein (110–115)
Aspartimide or glutamide formation under basic conditions
is a
common problem in usual peptide synthesis. Therefore, proline was
used as the preceding residue of the Asp or Glu residues in peptides
(1–4, 7, and 8), eliminating the possibility of aspartimide or glutamide side product
formation. However, for the synthesis of 9 (Scheme 4), proline or N-alkylated
amino acid was not used as other amino acids often follow Asp or Glu
in biological system. However, we used 20% piperidine/DMF with 5%
formic acid35 for Fmoc cleavage because
aspartimide or glutamide formation is usually higher in this step.
Moreover, there is a chance of aspartimide formation at the time of
conversion of the deprotected carboxylic acid to esters or thioesters,
as coupling reagents activate the carboxylic acid group. Furthermore,
benzylic ester and thiobenzyl ester (end products) also are prone
to aspartimide formation under basic conditions. The amount of added
base was carefully maintained not to exceed the required amount to
suppress aspartimide formation. With all of these precautions, we
were delighted to obtain 32% as the spectroscopic yield and 7% as
the isolated yield for 9, which is good for such an aspartimide-formation-prone
difficult sequence.

Fluorophores, such as dansyl chloride, are
widely used in protein
conformational studies.36 To demonstrate
that such an important moiety can be introduced on resin by our protocol
easily, we have synthesized 10, as depicted in Scheme 5. We have obtained
72% spectroscopic yield and 21% isolated yield of 10.

Scheme 5 Fluorophore Attachment on Peptide 10
Plausible Mechanistic Pathway
A plausible mechanism
of deprotection of tert-butyl ester outlined on the
basis of the existing literature27,37 is shown in Scheme 6. The Lewis acid
Fe(III) first coordinates to the oxygen atoms of the tert-butyl ester group and forms a complex. When iron(III) is coordinated
with the oxygen atoms of the tert-butyl ester, the
electron density on the oxygen atom gets shifted toward Fe. Then,
the carbon–oxygen bond (C–O) becomes week and easily
breaks down to form isobutene and the desired deprotected carboxylic
acid.

Scheme 6 Plausible Mechanistic Pathway of the Reaction
Conclusions
In summary, we have
developed an efficient, convenient, Lewis acid-based
deprotection strategy for modification of tert-butyl
ester containing a side chain of aspartic acid and glutamic acid during
solid-phase peptide synthesis. The reaction condition is mild and
tolerated by many common side chain-protecting groups. The applicability
of this approach is in introducing various nucleophiles (both electron-withdrawing
and electron-donating groups) and flurophores on the side chain of
aspartic acid and glutamic acid using standard coupling methods on-resin
without cleaving the peptide from resin. Most importantly, this new
method eliminates the effort, cost, time, and waste generation for
modification of the amino acids separately, when such amino acid derivatives
are not commercially available. One of the most abundant and nontoxic
metals, Iron, is used as a strong Lewis acid to deprotect carboxylic
acid in a greener manner.

Experimental Section
General Information
All chemicals were purchased from
commercial sources. Crude peptides were dissolved in CH3CN/H2O and purified by a Thermo Scientific Dionex UltiMate
3000 Rapid Separation LC system using a C18 Thermo Scientific column
or by RP-HPLC (Waters 600E) using a C18-μ Bondapak column at
a flow rate of 5 mL/min. A binary solvent system was used: solvent
A (0.1% TFA in H2O) and solvent B (0.1% TFA in CH3CN). A UV detector was used with an option of dual detection at 214
and 254 nm. A total run time of 20 min was used, and gradient used
for purification was 5–100% CH3CN for 18 min followed
by 100% CH3CN till 20 min. The purity of the peptides was
confirmed using an analytical HPLC system with an analytical column
at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, linear gradient of 5–100% CH3CN over 18 min in a total run time of 20 min. Otherwise, specific
conditions are mentioned for special cases. Dual wavelength was selected
at 214 and 254 nm. The mass of the peptide samples was analyzed on
a quadrupole time-of-flight system, in electrospray ionization (ESI)-positive
mode, equipped with MassHunter work station software. All 2D NMR spectra
were recorded on 600 MHz at 298 K using DMSO-d6 solvent. One-dimensional [1H] spectra were recorded
with 16 scans, and 2D [1H, 1H] total correlation
spectroscopy (TOCSY), 2D [1H, 1H] nuclear Overhauser
enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY), and correlated spectroscopy spectra
were recorded with NS = 32 scans, relaxation delay = 2 s, acquisition
time = 0.1556 s, spectral width = 6578.9 Hz, and acquired size = 1024
× 217 in both dimensions (F1 and F2). The mixing times are 0.08
s (for TOCSY) and 0.6 s (for NOESY). Chemical shifts were referenced
to residual DMSO-d6 at δ = 2.5 ppm
in 1H NMR and δ = 39.5 ppm in 13C NMR.

General Procedure for the Removal of tert-Butyl
Ester
A stirred solution of tert-butyl ester
(1 mmol) in 2 mL of dichloromethane was treated with 1.5 equiv of
FeCl3 at room temperature and stirred for 1 h. After completion
of the reaction (as indicated by TLC), the solution was diluted with
water and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic layer was concentrated
under reduced pressure and purified by column chromatography using
silica gel and the ethyl acetate–hexane mixture as the eluent.

General Procedure for Peptide Syntheses
Syntheses of
the peptides were carried out by the solid-phase peptide synthesis
method on the Rink amide AM resin (loading 0.7 mmol/g) following the
standard Fmoc/tBu orthogonal protection strategy.
The syntheses were performed manually on a Stuart blood tube rotator.
The resin was taken into a 2 mL frit-fitted plastic syringe and swollen
in dichloromethane (DCM) for 2 h followed by DMF for 1 h. Fmoc amino
acids (2 equiv), coupling reagent (2.5 equiv; BOP), and base (5 equiv;
DIPEA) were used. Each coupling step was monitored by Kaiser’s
test, and in cases of incomplete acylation, coupling cycles were repeated,
followed by capping with acetic anhydride (2 equiv) and N-methyl imidazole (3 equiv). Fmoc deprotection was performed with
20% piperidine in DMF mixture for 21 min (7 min × 3). The final
peptide was cleaved from the solid support using a cleavage cocktail
(90% TFA, 5% DCM, and 5% H2O) for 3 h. After cleavage from
the resin, the crude peptide was precipitated by cold diethyl ether
followed by centrifugation to achieve crude solid peptide.

Kinetics
of Removal of tert-Butyl Ester (A)
To understand the reaction kinetics, we performed
HPLC studies at a fixed time interval. We took 1 mmol Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OMe (A) and 1.5 equiv of FeCl3 in DCM medium. We took 10 μL of the reaction mixture in an
Eppendorf vial at 2 min interval. Then, 5 μL of DIPEA was added
to it for quenching the reaction. After that, the solvent was evaporated
by passing N2 gas into it and the reaction mixture was
diluted by adding HPLC-grade acetonitrile (500 μL) and filtered
via 0.22 μm filter paper. The sample (20 μL) from that
Eppendorf vial was injected in the HPLC system and the HPLC profile
was checked. An overlay of the HPLC profiles revealed a gradual conversion
of the tert-butyl ester (A) (tR = 8.6 min) to its free carboxylic acid analogue
(B) (tR = 6.8 min). At 6
min, both (A) and (B) existed in 50:50 ratio,
and at 20 min, in 95:5 ratio. Then, we checked the HPLC profile up
to 1 h, but from 20 min to 1 h, conversion was very slow. After 1
h, we observed 98% conversion from (A) to (B) (see Figures S1–S7, Supporting Information).

Kinetics of Removal of Benzyl Ester (C)
Like tert-butyl ester, we took Fmoc-Asp(OBzl)-OMe
(C) for checking whether benzyl ester will be cleaved
in the presence of FeCl3. For this purpose, we took 1 mmol
(C) and 1.5 equiv of FeCl3 in DCM medium.
We took 10 μL of the reaction mixture in an Eppendorf vial from
the main bulk after 10 min. Then, 5 μL of DIPEA was added to
this for quenching the reaction. After that, the solvent was evaporated
from that Eppendorf vial by passing N2 gas and then the
reaction mixture was diluted by adding HPLC-grade acetonitrile (500
μL). The sample (20 μL) from this was injected in the
HPLC system, and the HPLC profile was checked. From HPLC diagrams,
we could not detect any deprotected product till 12 h (see Figures S8–S12, Supporting Information).

Kinetics of Removal of the Allyl Group from Allyl Benzoate (D)
Allyl benzoate (1 mmol; D) was dissolved
in DCM, 1.5 equiv of FeCl3 was added to it, and the reaction
was kept for 12 h. After 1 h, we took 10 μL of the reaction
mixture in an Eppendorf vial and added 5 μL of DIPEA to it for
quenching the reaction. Then, the solvent was evaporated by passing
N2 gas and the reaction mixture was diluted by adding HPLC-grade
acetonitrile (500 μL). The sample (20 μL) from that Eppendorf
vial was injected in the HPLC system. After 3, 6, 8, and 12 h, we
had done the same treatment. No deprotected free carboxylic acid peak
was obtained till 12 h reaction in HPLC (see Figures S13–S17, Supporting Information).

Like for allyl benzoate, a similar experiment
had been done on ethyl benzoate, but we could not obtain any free
carboxylic acid peak on the HPLC profile (see Figures S18–S23, Supporting Information).

Kinetics of
Removal of the Trt Group from Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH (F)
Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH (1 mmol) was taken in a round-bottom
flask and dissolved in DCM, then FeCl3 (1.5 equiv) was
added, and the reaction was kept for 4 h. The reaction mixture (10
μL) was taken in an Eppendorf vial after 45 min and then 5 μL
of DIPEA was added to it for quenching the reaction. After that, the
solvent was evaporated and the reaction mixture was diluted by adding
HPLC-grade acetonitrile (500 μL). The solvent (20 μL)
was injected in the HPLC system. After 4 h, we obtained fully deprotected
amide product, indicated in the HPLC profile (see Figures S24–S28, Supporting Information).

Kinetics of
Removal of the Pbf Group from Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH (G)
Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH (1 mmol; G) was
dissolved in DCM, then 1.5 equiv of FeCl3 was added to
it, and the reaction was kept for 12 h. After 1 h, 10 μL of
the reaction mixture was taken in an Eppendorf vial and 5 μL
of DIPEA was added to it for quenching the reaction, followed by evaporation
of the solvent. Then, it was diluted by adding 500 μL of HPLC-grade
acetonitrile, and 20 μL of the sample from that Eppendorf was
injected in the HPLC system. HPLC profiles indicated that there was
no deprotected product peak till 12 h reaction (see Figures S29–S34, Supporting Information).

Peptide 1
The synthesis of peptide 1 was carried out as previously
described using Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH, Fmoc-Pro-OH, Fmoc-Phe-OH,
and Fmoc-Ala-OH on the
Rink Amide AM resin (loading 0.7 mmol/g). After acetylation of the
N-terminus of the peptide, the resin was washed three times with DCM.
Then, the tert-butyl ester group present on the side
chain of the aspartic acid was cleaved using ferric chloride (5 equiv)
in dichloromethane for 1.5 h. After completion of the reaction, the
resin was washed with dimethylformamide (DMF) 10 times (1 mL ×
10 min) to remove the excess FeCl3. Then, the free carboxylic
acid was coupled using 4-methoxy benzyl alcohol (3 equiv), BOP (2.5
equiv), and DIPEA (5 equiv) for 3 h. After completion of the reaction,
the peptide-anchored resin was washed several times with DMF followed
by DCM. Then, the peptide was cleaved from the resin by the cleavage
cocktail. TFA was evaporated. The crude product was precipitated by
cold diethyl ether, purified by preparative HPLC, and analyzed and
characterized by HPLC, mass spectrometry, and 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy.

Peptide 9
The synthesis of peptide 9 was carried out as previously described using Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH, Fmoc-Gly-OH, Fmoc-Ile-OH, Fmoc-Leu-OH, and Fmoc-Glu(OtBu)-OH, on the Rink Amide AM resin (loading 0.7 mmol/g).
After coupling of Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH with the resin,
we had started the tert-butyl ester cleavage and
coupled the free carboxylic acid on the side chain of aspartic acid
with benzyl alcohol (5 equiv), BOP (2.5 equiv), and DIPEA (3 equiv)
for 3 h. Then, Fmoc-Glu(OtBu)-OH was coupled with
the main backbone of the peptide sequence and treated similarly as
describe above. Then, we obtained the side chain-coupled amide (using
benzyl amine (5 equiv)) product. Then, the peptide sequence was continued,
and after the N-terminus of the peptide was acetylated, we did deprotection
of tert-butyl ester on the side chain of the second
glutamic acid present in the peptide sequence. To obtain thioester-containing
side chain-protected second glutamic acid, we have taken benzyl mercaptan
(5 equiv), BOP (2.5 equiv), and DIPEA (3 equiv) for 3 h. After completion
of the reaction, the peptide-anchored resin was washed several times
with DMF followed by DCM. Then, the peptide was cleaved from the resin

Peptide 10
The synthesis
of peptide 10 was carried out as previously described
using Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH, Fmoc-Pro-OH, Fmoc-Phe-OH,
Fmoc-Leu-OH, and Fmoc-Gly-OH
on the Rink Amide AM resin (loading 0.7 mmol/g). After acetylation
of the N-terminus of the peptide, the resin was washed three times
(1 mL × 3 min) with DCM. Then, the tert-butyl
ester group present on the side chain of the aspartic acid was cleaved
using ferric chloride (5 equiv) in dichloromethane for 1.5 h. After
completion of the reaction, the resin was washed with dimethylformamide
(DMF) 10 times (1 mL × 10 min) to remove the excess FeCl3. Then, the free carboxylic acid was coupled by one side of
ethylene diamine (3 equiv), BOP (2.5 equiv), and DIPEA (5 equiv) for
3 h. After washing with DMF (1 mL × 5 min), the other side of
diethylene amine was coupled with dansyl chloride (3 equiv) using
base DIPEA (5 equiv) for 3 h. After completion of the reaction, the
peptide-anchored resin was washed several times with DMF followed
by DCM. Then, the peptide was cleaved from the resin by the cleavage
cocktail. TFA was evaporated. The crude product was precipitated by
cold diethyl ether, purified by preparative HPLC, and analyzed and
characterized by HPLC, mass spectrometry, and 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy.
