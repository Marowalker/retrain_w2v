Finding
a simple and effective strategy to eliminate tumor metastatic
lymph nodes is highly desired in clinical tumor treatment. Herein,
we reported a Chinese traditional ink (Hu-ink)-based treatment for
photothermal therapy (PTT) of tumor metastatic lymph nodes. By simple
dilution, stable Chinese traditional ink dispersion was obtained,
which presents excellent photothermal effect because of its high absorption
in near-infrared (NIR) region. Meanwhile, as revealed by staining
and photoacoustic imaging, Hu-ink could transfer to nearby lymph nodes
after directly injected into the primary tumors. Under the guidance
of dual-modality mapping, the metastatic sentinel lymph nodes could
be subsequently eliminated by NIR irradiation. The good biocompatibility
of Hu-ink has also been verified by a series of experiments. Therefore,
the Hu-ink-based treatment exhibits great potential for PTT of tumor
metastatic lymph nodes in future clinical practice.

1 Introduction
Today,
metastasis has become one of the greatest challenges in
cancer diagnosis and therapy and is directly or indirectly responsible
for ∼90% of cancer patient deaths.1,2 In
the early stages of cancer metastasis, tumor cells first transfer
to sentinel lymph nodes, which are adjacent to the primary cancer,
and subsequently flow into deeper lymph nodes via lymphatic vessels.3,4 In clinical practice, physicians generally remove those lymph nodes
with potential metastases completely by surgical dissection to prolong
the lifetime of cancer patients. However, it inevitably brings about
low treatment rate, considerable surgical trauma, and sometimes multiple
complications.5,6 Therefore, exploring simple and
effective treatments to remove tumor metastatic lymph nodes and improve
patients’ quality of life has become very necessary and urgent
in clinical tumor therapy.

Photothermal therapy (PTT) is an
emerging tumor treatment strategy,
which utilizes hyperthermia generated from absorbed near-infrared
(NIR) light energy by photoabsorbing agents to kill tumor cells.7−13 Different from chemotherapy, surgical treatment, and radiotherapy,
PTT is noninvasive and more efficient.7,14,15 In the past decade, PTT with diverse nanomaterials
to eliminate cancer metastases lymph nodes has attracted extensive
attention by several groups, including our group.3,16−20 For instance, Liu and
his co-workers developed a treatment method based on PEGylated single-walled
carbon nanotubes for PTT of tumor sentinel lymph nodes and achieved
remarkably improved treatment effect in an animal tumor model.21 To meet the clinical practice, the potential
metastasis of deeper lymph nodes was further ablated in our previous
work, using magnetic graphene oxide as a theranostic agent.22 However, preparation of these artificial nanomaterials
usually requires high cost, complicated synthetic process, and unavoidably
toxic catalyst or chemicals,23,24 which impede their
future clinical application. For the clinical application, exploring
an environment-friendly material with simple preparation procedure,
good biocompatibility, and excellent therapeutic efficiency is still
highly desired.

Figure 1 Schematic of Hu-ink-based treatment for photothermal therapy
of
tumor metastatic lymph nodes. Hu-ink dispersion was directly injected
into the primary tumors on the right hind foot pad of the mouse manifesting
lymph node metastases. After 24 h injection, the Hu-ink could migrate
from primary tumors into the metastatic lymph nodes via lymphatic
vessels as revealed by dual-modality staining and photoacoustic imaging.
Photothermal therapy was then conducted by exposing metastatic lymph
nodes to an 808 nm laser.

Chinese traditional ink, as a conventional writing material
with
intrinsic color of black, good water stability, and desired fluidity,
has been used for a long time in China and still fascinates contemporary
artists around the world. It was derived from natural plant, and its
main component is carbon.25 Considering
the similarities in color and component between Chinese traditional
ink and other artificially synthesized carbonaceous materials, such
as carbon nanotubes26 and graphene,27 which have been extensively investigated for
PTT of cancer lymph node metastases,21,22,28 we are thus encouraged to explore whether Chinese
traditional ink can also be used for inhibiting cancer metastases
by PTT. Herein, a simple and effective treatment method was successfully
developed by utilizing one of the most famous Chinese traditional
inks, Hu-Kaiwen ink (Hu-ink). The Hu-ink-based treatment can not only
provide dual-modality staining and photoacoustic imaging (PAI) of
lymph nodes, but also be used for PTT of tumor metastatic lymph nodes
in rectal cancer (Figure 1).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Preparation
and Characterization of Hu-Ink
To obtain an applicable sample,
the condensed Hu-ink was first
diluted into aqueous dispersion with a lower concentration. The obtained
Hu-ink dispersion without any further treatment was black in color
and stable in physiological environment, including water, phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), and Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640; furthermore,
no aggregation was observed even after keeping undisturbed for 3 days
(Figure 2a). The nanoscaled
morphology of Hu-ink was examined by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) (Figure 2b),
which demonstrates that Hu-ink mainly exist in the form of small aggregates.
These small aggregates consist of a few nanoparticles with diameter
of about 20–50 nm. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement
(Figure 2c) further
shows that Hu-ink aqueous dispersion possesses a hydrodynamic diameter
of about 186 nm (polydispersity index: 0.18), which was a crucial
prerequisite for biomedical applications.29 In the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, no other characteristic
peaks are found except carbon peak (Figure S1, Supporting Information), which confirms that the main component
of Hu-ink is carbon.25 Raman spectroscopy
was a common tool to characterize graphene-related materials.30 D band (∼1300 cm–1,
corresponding to the defects) and G band (∼1600 cm–1, related to the sp2 carbon sites) peaks could be observed
in Figure 2d with the
ratio ID/IG = 0.96, which confirms the existence of graphene sheetlike structure
in Hu-ink.31 The UV–vis–NIR
spectra (Figure 2e)
also revealed that Hu-ink has high absorption in the NIR region around
650–900 nm, in which hemoglobin and water, the major absorbers
of biological tissue, have their lowest absorption coefficient.32 The high NIR absorption capability of Hu-ink
encouraged us to investigate its photothermal properties.33−35 Hu-ink dispersions with different concentrations were irradiated
under an 808 nm laser (the commercial and widely used wavelength in
photothermal therapy).8−13 The temperature of Hu-ink dispersions elevated distinctly after
increasing the concentration of Hu-ink (Figure 2f). For instance, the temperature change
could rise as high as 55 °C after 5 min of continuous irradiation
when the concentration of the Hu-ink reached 100 μg/mL, which
is quite higher than that of water (below 5 °C). The photothermal
conversion efficiency of Hu-ink was found to be about 39% (Figure 3a) using the reported
method.11 Except nanographene (51.6%),10,36 Hu-ink possesses higher photothermal conversion efficiency than
commercial gold nanorods (21%) and nanoshells (13%),34 Cu9S5 nanocrystals (25.7%),37 MoS2 nanosheets (24.37%),38 and ICG (15.1%)39 (Table S1, Supporting Information). Furthermore,
we found that the photothermal effect of Hu-ink showed almost no change
with increasing storage time for 90 days (Figure 3b), revealing that Hu-ink presented stable
photothermal effect. The hydrodynamic diameter and ζ potential
were also stable during the experiment (Figure 3c,d). The stable physicochemical properties
of Hu-ink are very important for clinical storage. Considering the
simple preparation, excellent photothermal effect, and high stability
during clinical storage, Hu-ink possesses remarkable potential to
be applied for clinical PTT of cancer.

2.2 In Vitro Photothermal Therapy
A promising
nanomaterial must have a low cellular toxicity, so the Cell Counting
Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to test the cytotoxicity of Hu-ink in
vitro. As shown in Figure 4a, the cell viability of human colon cancer cells (SW-620)
and human colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT-116) incubated with different
concentrations of Hu-ink for 24 h presented insignificant decrease
even at high concentration (200 μg/mL), which indicated that
our obtained Hu-ink dispersion had no inherent toxicity. The PTT efficiency
of cancer cells was also estimated by CCK-8 assay. From Figure 4b, the relative cell viabilities
were 50.2% at the Hu-ink concentration of 25 μg/mL after 5 min
of continuous irradiation (2 W/cm2), and when increasing
the Hu-ink concentration to 50 μg/mL, the relative cell viabilities
decreased to 23.1%. In contrast, negligible effect on cell viability
was noticed in normal saline (NS) group due to the lack of photothermal
agent. For more intuitive response of PTT efficiency, the live cells
and dead cells were discriminated by calcein acetoxymethyl ester (calcein
AM) and propidium iodide (PI) staining, respectively. As shown in Figure 4c, HCT-116 cells
only emitted green fluorescence in NS group for the lack of dead cells.
However, in the group of Hu-ink at 25 μg/mL, nearly 50% of cells
were dead by thermal treatment and thus emitted red fluorescence.
In the group of Hu-ink at 50 μg/mL, almost all HCT-116 cells
were dead and emitted red fluorescence with the same NIR laser illumination.
Thus, the effect of PTT can be improved by increasing the Hu-ink concentration
of the tumor site without enhancing the power of NIR laser.

cancer cells stained with calcein AM (live cells, green fluorescence)
and PI (dead cells, red fluorescence) after treated with normal saline,

2.3 Dual-Modality
Staining/Photoacoustic Imaging
of Lymph Nodes
Lateral lymph node metastasis is the main
metastatic way of rectal cancer, especially in low rectal cancer,
which is an important factor affecting healing.40 However, locating those lymph nodes accurately and rapidly
is difficult in clinical treatment. In clinical practice, magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) combined with T1 or T2 contrast agents or computed tomography (CT) is a favorite imaging
technique to diagnose tumor and lymph nodes.41,42 However, its complex and bulky instrument cannot provide real-time
visualization during the treatment procedure.43 Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a powerful imaging technology based
on the illumination of light-absorbing nanoprobes and ultrasound detection.44 Compared with the traditional MRI and CT, PAI
combines simple operation, enhanced penetration depth, and high sensitivity,
which can provide us real-time information during therapeutic process.43,44 Due to the strong NIR absorption property, the Hu-ink can not only
be used for PTT, but also has great potentiality for PAI contrast
agent.12,45,46 Besides, it
is reported that nanoparticles after being injected into the primary
tumors could effectively transfer to the sentinel lymph nodes and
subsequently flow into deeper lymph nodes along the lymphatic vessels.17,47 Therefore, we wondered if we could use Hu-ink as a nanoprobe to
locate lymph nodes by PAI. In our experiments, Balb/c mice with HCT-116
tumor inoculation on their right hind pad were allowed to grow 30
days for the growth of primary tumors and the development of metastatic
tumors in lymph nodes. Next, NS and Hu-ink were separately injected
into the primary tumors on the right hind pad of those mice, and popliteal
lymph nodes (the first station lymph nodes or sentinel lymph nodes)
and sciatic lymph nodes (the second station lymph nodes) were then
imaged under a PAI scanner after 24 h. In the NS group (Figure 5c,d), the popliteal and sciatic
lymph nodes were hardly distinguished from the surrounding tissues
due to the same signal. On the contrary, in Hu-ink group (Figure 5g,h), remarkably
enhanced PAI signals were detected in both popliteal and sciatic lymph
nodes after injecting Hu-ink into the primary tumors 24 h later. The
relative signal intensities were 4.75 ± 0.23 and 2.33 ±
0.03 (n = 3). Compared with the NS group, the photoacoustic
signals in popliteal and sciatic lymph nodes were improved by 15 and
5 times, respectively. At the same time, after exposed by anatomy,
popliteal and sciatic lymph nodes were also easy to be discriminated
from the surrounding normal tissues owing to the accumulation of black
Hu-ink (Figure 5e,f).
In a word, the dual-modality staining/PAI of Hu-ink was proved to
be an effective method for guiding the treatment of tumor lymph nodes.

2.4 Dual-Modality Lymph-Mapping-Guided
PTT
Next, dual-modality mapping was employed to guide the
photothermal
ablation of metastatic sentinel lymph nodes in rectal cancer. In this
study, popliteal lymph nodes (sentinel lymph nodes) were appointed
as therapeutic target to elaborate the feasibility of PTT. Hu-ink
(50 μL, 5 mg/mL) was injected into the primary tumors on the
right hind pad of those mice manifesting lymph node metastases. After
24 h injection, the popliteal lymph nodes were irradiated by an 808
nm laser (1 W/cm2) and the temperature change was recorded
by an infrared thermal camera (Figure 6). In the Hu-ink + laser group, the local temperature
of the popliteal lymph nodes quickly increased from 26.4 to 58.8 °C
in 5 min, which is sufficient to eliminate the tumor tissues.48 However, the temperature of the NS group under
the same laser power exhibited slight change and reach 31.1 °C,
which would not induce any damage to the normal tissues.21

Figure 6 Photothermal therapy of popliteal lymph nodes for different
treatment
groups under 1 W/cm2 laser irradiation for 5 min (NS group:
injected with 50 μL of normal saline on the right hind foot
pad of the mice manifesting lymph node metastases; PTT group: injected
with 50 μL of Hu-ink on the right hind foot pad of the mice
manifesting lymph node metastases, 5 mg/mL).

Subsequently, we evaluate the efficacy of PTT in vivo. Mice
manifesting
sentinel lymph node metastases were randomly divided into four treatment
groups after tumor inoculation for 30 days (n = 5
per group): (1) 50 μL of NS injected into the primary tumors
on the right hind without laser irradiation; (2) 50 μL of NS
injected into the primary tumors on the right hind foot pad with laser
irradiation (1 W/cm2, 5 min); (3) 50 μL of Hu-ink
(5 mg/mL) injected into the primary tumors on the right hind foot
pad without laser irradiation; and (4) 50 μL of Hu-ink (5 mg/mL)
injected into the primary tumors on the right hind foot pad with laser
irradiation (1 W/cm2, 5 min). PTT was carried out after
24 h injection. On the 7th day, the mice were sacrificed through anesthetization
and the popliteal lymph nodes were removed. The weight of the popliteal
lymph nodes for groups I, II, III, and IV were 8.92 ± 5.2, 9.72
± 4.93, 9.28 ± 4.73, and 1.02 ± 0.34 mg, respectively
(Figure 7b). The remarkable
antitumor efficiency was obtained in group IV, which was better than
all of the other groups (P < 0.05). To further
evaluate the PTT effect, histopathological examination with hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) staining was conducted. Necrosis and pykonosis
(typical thermal damage characteristics of the tumors) were presented
in group IV (Figure 7f). By contrast, intact morphology of cells existed in the other
three groups (Figure 7c–e). Finally, the biological safety of Hu-ink was further
evaluated. No pathological damage was detected in the pathological
sections of major organs, including brain, heart, lung, spleen, liver,
and kidney (Figure S2a–f, Supporting
information). In the course of the whole treatment, the weight of
mice did not change. Therefore, our obtained Hu-ink had no significant
side effect and exhibited good biocompatibility.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have utilized
one of the famous Chinese traditional
inks, Hu-ink, and successfully developed a simple and effective Hu-ink-based
treatment for PTT of metastatic lymph nodes in rectal cancer. Both
in vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that Hu-ink exhibit good
biocompatibility. Benefiting from the intrinsic black and the strong
absorbance in the NIR region, Hu-ink could not only serve as dual-modality
mapping agents for staining/PAI of tumor lymph nodes, but also act
as a photothermal agent to ablate the metastatic sentinel lymph nodes.
The dual-modality lymphatic tracing method and the noninvasive PTT
of metastatic sentinel lymph nodes have good clinical operability,
especially in lateral lymph node metastasis of rectal tumor. Therefore,
our work possesses remarkable potential in future clinical practices.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Hu-ink
was obtained from
Anhui Jixi Hu-Kaiwen Ink Factory, China. Propidium iodide (PI), calcein
acetoxymethyl ester (calcein AM), and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8)
were obtained from KeyGen BioTech. Penicillin–streptomycin
solution, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM),
RPMI 1640 cell culture medium, trypsin–ethylene diamine tetraacetic
acid solution, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were obtained from Gibco.
Human colon cancer cells (SW-620) and human colorectal cancer cell
lines (HCT-116) were acquired from Life Science (Shanghai, China).
Male Balb/c nude mice (6- to 8-week old) were purchased from Shanghai
Slac Lab Animal Co. Ltd. All procedures for animal experiments were
conducted strictly under the operation manual ratified by the Ethics
Committee of Fudan University. All of these reagents were used as
received without further purification, and deionized water was obtained
from a Millipore water depuration system.

4.2 Preparation
and Characterization of Hu-Ink
Condensed Hu-ink was first
diluted into aqueous dispersion with
a lower concentration, and the obtained Hu-ink was then stored for
further use. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded
on a Tecnai G2-20 TWIN transmission electron microscope. Dynamic light
scattering (DLS) particle size analyzer (Malvern Nano-ZS90) was used
to measure ζ potential and hydrodynamic diameters. X-ray diffraction
(XRD) characterization was performed on an X’pert PRO diffractometer.
Raman spectrum was recorded with the 532 nm laser source by Raman
spectroscopy (XploRA, HORIBA Jobin Yvon). UV–vis–NIR
spectra were obtained using a spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda
750). Temperature elevation assay was conducted by laser irradiation:
Hu-ink dispersions with different concentrations of 25, 50, and 100
μg/mL were exposed continuously to an 808 nm laser (power density:
2 W/cm2, spot size: 6 mm × 8 mm) for 5 min. The temperature
of the dispersions was synchronously noted using an infrared thermal
camera (VarioCAM HR, InfraTec, Germany).

4.3 Cell
Experiment
The cytotoxicity
of Hu-ink was assessed by CCK-8 assay. Approximately 1 × 104 HCT-116 and SW-620 cells were plated in 96-well plates and
cultured for 24 h at the standard cell culture environment. The cells
were cultured with samples (0–200 μg/mL) for 24 h and
then washed twice with PBS; 100 μL of RPMI 1640 cell medium
and 10 μL of CCK-8 solution were mixed, and the mixture was
then added into each plate and continued culture for another 2 h.
Next, the OD value at 450 nm was read using a microplate reader (Synergy
TM2, BIO-TEK Instruments Inc.). For in vitro PTT, HCT-116 cells were
incubated in 96-well plates and cultured for 12 h. Then, the dispersion
containing Hu-ink (25 or 50 μg/mL) was added into each plate
and incubated for another 2 h, followed by an 808 nm laser irradiation
(2 W/cm2, 5 min). Next, the CCK-8 assay was used to test
relative cell viabilities. For further qualitative assessment of PTT,
HCT-116 cells (2.0 × 105 cells per well) were seeded
in a 20 mm glass-bottom culture dish (NEST, China), cultured for 2
h with 25 or 50 μg/mL Hu-ink at 37 °C, and subsequently
followed by an 808 nm laser irradiation (2 W/cm2, 5 min).
Finally, the cells were stained for 20 min with PI and calcein AM
and observed by a ZEISS LSM710 live cell confocal laser imaging system
(Carl Zeiss, Germany).

4.4 In Vivo Dual-Modality Mapping
HCT-116
lymph node metastases animal models were obtained by subcutaneous
injection of 3 × 106 HCT-116 cells suspended in 50
μL of PBS via the right hind foot pad of nude mice; 30 days
after inoculation, the mice with spherical hard lumps in their popliteal
fossa were designated for our study.22 Mice
manifesting lymph node metastases were randomly divided into two groups
(three mouse for each group). Then, 50 μL of Hu-ink dispersion
(5 mg/mL) or normal saline (NS) was injected into the primary tumors
on the right hind foot pad of each mouse. Subsequently, PAI was conducted
by VisualSonic Vevo 2100 LAZR system after 24 h. At the same time,
sciatic lymph nodes and popliteal lymph nodes were slightly dissected
and then photographed.

4.5 Photothermal Ablation of
Popliteal Lymph Nodes
In this experiment, popliteal lymph
nodes (the sentinel lymph nodes)
were appointed as therapeutic target to elaborate the feasibility
of PTT. A total of 20 mice exhibiting lymph node metastases were randomly
divided into four groups (n = 5 per group). One group
was injected with 50 μL of NS into the primary tumors on the
right hind foot pad without laser irradiation. The second group was
injected with 50 μL of NS into the primary tumors on the right
hind foot pad and then irradiated with an 808 nm laser (1 W/cm2, 5 min). The third group was injected with 50 μL of
Hu-ink (5 mg/mL) into the primary tumors on the right hind foot pad
without laser irradiation. The fourth group was injected with 50 μL
of Hu-ink (5 mg/mL) into the primary tumors on the right hind foot
pad and then irradiated with an 808 nm laser (1 W/cm2,
5 min). Temperature changes were subsequently recorded using an infrared
thermal camera. After 7 days, the mice were sacrificed through anesthesia
and then the popliteal lymph nodes, heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney,
and brain tissue were removed for histopathological evaluation. At
the same time, popliteal lymph nodes were weighed to further assess
therapeutic efficacy.

4.6 Statistical Analysis
Unpaired Student’s t test was used for
comparison between two groups, and one-way
ANOVA with Fisher’s LSD was used for multigroup analysis. A
probability (P) less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation
(SD) unless otherwise indicated.
