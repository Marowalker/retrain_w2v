An
inexpensive, simple, and high-activity catalyst preparation
method has been introduced in this work. Pt and RuOx catalysts were fabricated by soaking inexpensive graphite
electrodes (pencil-lead graphite rod: PGR) in catalyst precursor solutions
and using a simple flame-annealing method, which results in lower
amount of Pt and RuOx catalyst layers.
From X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and near-edge X-ray absorption
fine structure analysis, it has been found that platinum and ruthenium
were deposited as zero-valence metal (Pt) and oxide (RuOx), respectively. Catalytic activities of Pt/PGR and
RuOx/PGR for hydrogen evolution reaction
(HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were evaluated using neutral
1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte, respectively.
Although HER and OER currents using PGR without catalysts were −16
mA cm–2 (at −1.5 V vs Ag/AgCl) and +20 mA
cm–2 (at +2.0 V vs Ag/AgCl), they were improved
to −110 and +80 mA cm–2 with catalysts (Pt
and RuOx), respectively. Such an inexpensive
and rapid catalyst electrode preparation method on PGR using flame-annealing
is a very significant method in the initial catalyst activity evaluation
requiring a large amount of trial and error.

1 Introduction
Natural energies such
as sunlight and wind power are indispensable
in order to manage global energy and environmental issues and are
the most important energy sources for mankind in the future. However,
it is necessary to overcome the unstable generation due to weather
variation, which is one of the weak points of natural energy. Therefore,
a cost-effective huge energy storage system should be established
as soon as possible. One of the candidates is a hydrogen energy system.1−3 The technology of producing high-purity hydrogen by water electrolysis
using electric power obtained from natural energy is the most attractive
method of converting natural energy into chemical energy because it
does not emit any CO2.4−6 In order to reach a practical
energy conversion efficiency, it is necessary to lower the overpotential
of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathodic side and
the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anodic side. Although noble
metals such as platinum, iridium, and ruthenium can exhibit high catalytic
activity,7−9 these elements are of low natural abundance and quite
expensive. Hence, it is important to reduce the amount of noble-metal
catalysts on electrodes.

In this work, we have prepared Pt and
RuOx catalysts deposited on a pencil-lead
graphite rod (PGR) by
coating the precursor solution and using flame-annealing, which is
a very easy method to fabricate electrocatalysts in a short time.
In addition, because the required amount of catalyst is quite low
in this method, it is possible to produce high-active electrocatalysts
at a very low cost. This method is very convenient in the field of
catalyst development which requires a large amount of trial and error.
In this work, specially, the performance of water-electrolysis catalysts
(Pt and RuOx) deposited on a PGR by flame-annealing
was analyzed and evaluated by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), near-edge X-ray absorption fine
structure (NEXAFS), electrochemical measurement with cyclic voltammetry
(CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and stability
test in water electrolysis using Hoffman electrolysis apparatus.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Fabrication Method of Catalyst-Deposited
PGR
by Flame-Annealing
In this study, a PGR (the hardness: 4B,
uni exchangeable pencil graphite rod, φ2.0 mm × 130 mm,
Mitsubishi Pencil Co., Ltd., Japan), which is low cost and useful
as a base material for the catalyst-deposited electrode, was used
as a base material for the catalyst-deposited electrode in water electrolysis.10Figure 1a shows the schematic illustration of the fabrication procedure
of Pt and RuOx catalysts deposited on
a PGR by flame-annealing. The PGR electrodes with Pt and RuOx catalysts were named Pt/PGR and RuOx/PGR, respectively.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic illustration of the preparation
process of catalyst-deposited
PGR electrodes by flame-annealing: (b) photographs of the PGR surface
with/without catalysts (Pt and RuOx).

First, the corn-shaped tip at the top edge of the
PGR was cut,
and then, the cross-section was scraped by a file to be a flat-shaped
edge. In order to remove the coating polymer on the surface and to
activate the graphite, the whole of the PGR was annealed for 1 min
in a flame using liquefied petroleum gas until the PGR emitted red
light by heat.10 The PGR was air-cooled
to room temperature.

Next, a catalyst precursor solution of
Pt and RuOx, which were selected as the
high activity catalysts for HER
and OER, respectively, was prepared.11−15 For the Pt precursor solution, 20 mg of hexachloroplatinic(IV)
acid (PtCl6·6H2O, Kishida Chemical Co.,
Ltd.) was dissolved in 1 mL of ethanol (EtOH). For the RuOx precursor solution, ruthenium(III) nitrosyl nitrate
solution (Ru 1.5%, solvent content: water 95.0%) (Ru(NO)(NO3)3, Strem Chemicals, Inc.) was used as purchased. Each
precursor solution was transferred into an elongated test tube to
a depth of 4 cm or more, which is to deposit the catalyst on the PGR
over the range of 4 cm. The PGR were immersed in each metal catalyst
precursor solution for 10 s.

For Pt/PGR, immediately after taking
out from the Pt-precursor
solution, flame-annealing was applied for 20 s. At this time, the
PGR was slid to rod axis direction and rotated 180° to the left
and right directions by hand so that the catalysts could be evenly
annealed. The Pt catalyst was deposited on the PGR surface by immersing
and annealing, repeatedly. For the optimization of Pt catalyst deposition
times on the PGR by flame-annealing, the number of dip times was varied
by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 times, and the annealing duration was varied
for 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 80 s.

For RuOx/PGR, when the PGR with RuOx precursor
solution was subjected to the
same annealing for 20 s as Pt, RuOx could
not be uniformly coated on the PGR surface, and a stable electrocatalyst
could not be produced, due to the water solvent for the RuOx precursor solution. Therefore, the method of preparing
the RuOx catalyst is different from a
Pt catalyst. First, after immersing in the precursor solution, preannealing
was performed for 2 s. This operation was repeated to cover the whole
PGR with the RuOx catalyst. For preannealing,
the PGR with RuOx precursor solution was
slid quickly in the horizontal direction in order to prevent the strong
annealing on the PGR. After that, RuOx on the entire PGR was immediately projected in the flame by postannealing
for 10 s (Figure 1a).
Further optimization, the number of dip times was varied at 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 times, and the post-annealing time was varied at
5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 80 s. The optimization results for the number
of immersions and annealing times in the catalyst deposition will
be shown in the Result and Discussion section.

2.2 Material Analysis Methods
The structure
of the PGR electrode surface was observed by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM, JSM-6510, JEOL). The chemical-bonding state of Pt/PGR and RuOx/PGR and the relationship between catalyst
and PGR were characterized by EDX (TM3030, HITACHI) spectroscopy,
XPS, and total-electron-yield (TEY) and total-fluorescence-yield (TFY)
NEXAFS spectroscopy with soft X-ray (BL-09A, in NewSUBARU SR facility,16 University of Hyogo, Japan). For XPS, Pt and
RuOx deposited on a quartz glass substrate
by flame-annealing were measured as a reference. This is to confirm
whether catalyst formation by flame-annealing affects the substrate.
In addition, XPS and XAFS also measured RuO2 powder (Kishida
Chemical Co., Ltd.) as a reference.

2.3 Electrochemical
Measurements
The
electrochemical performance of Pt/PGR and RuOx/PGR was characterized by CV, EIS, and Faraday efficiency measurement
or stability test using Hoffman electrolysis apparatus (H-shaped test
tubes). In this study, 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte
was used for all measurements.

CV and EIS were performed using
a three-electrode system with a platinum foil (20 × 60 mm, 24
cm2) for the counter electrode and a silver/silver chloride
(Ag/AgCl) electrode for the reference electrode. The reaction area
of the working electrode was 2.54 cm2. For CV, the applied
potential was set at −1.5 to 0 V (vs Ag/AgCl) for the HER electrode
(cathodic side) and 0 to 1.5 V (vs Ag/AgCl) of the OER electrode (anodic
side), and the scan speed was 25 mV s–1, and the
results at the third cycle were shown. Further, platinum rods [φ2.0
mm × 100 mm Nilaco Co., Ltd., Japan] of the same diameter as
the PGR were measured as a reference.

EIS measurements were
performed by applying various frequency voltage
waves from 10 mHz to 1 kHz with an amplitude of 10 mV at the bias
voltage of −1.5 V (in HER) and +1.5 V (in OER) against the
Ag/AgCl reference electrode. In order to stabilize the electrode,
a resting time of 3 min was set before measurements.

The Faraday
efficiency measurement and stability test were performed
on a two-electrode system using PGR electrodes for both HER and OER
electrodes. For the Faraday efficiency measurement and stability test,
Pt/PGR and RuOx/PGR were used for HER
and OER electrodes, respectively. Without the catalyst, the PGR electrode
couple was used for the comparison. For CV, the distance between the
electrodes was 5 mm. For Faraday efficiency measurement and stability
test in the Hoffman electrolysis apparatus, the distance between electrodes
were 60 mm.10 For the Faraday efficiency
measurement, the applied potential was set at 10 V, which is due to
the significant solution resistance by the electrode distance (60
mm) in the Hoffman electrolysis apparatus, and the Faraday efficiency
and hydrogen and oxygen evolution rates were measured until the hydrogen
amount reached up to an apparatus limit of 50 mL. The stability test
was performed with a constant voltage at 10 V, and the current variation
was measured.

3 Result and Discussion
The photographs of PGR, Pt/PGR, and RuOx/PGR are shown in Figure 1b. The surface of Pt/PGR and RuOx/PGR are more metallic glossy than that of PGR without the catalyst
by flame-annealing. The surface structures of PGR, Pt/PGR, and RuOx/PGR were confirmed by SEM images (Figure 2). From the SEM image,
it was confirmed that the Pt or Ru catalyst was deposited so as to
cover the entire surface of the PGR. Also, the structure of the deposited
catalyst was not porous, and it appeared that the catalyst had been
deposited along the shape of the PGR. Table 1 shows the results of elemental analysis
by EDX. For PGR, C was 81.2%, and O was 14.3%, the surface consisted
mainly of carbon and oxygen. Pt/PGR and RuOx/PGR were detected with Pt of 15.5% and Ru of 9.6%, respectively.
The carbon content decreased by depositing catalysts on the PGR surface.
Pt/PGR showed no change in oxygen content. However, in RuOx/PGR, the oxygen amount was increased to +7.3% from
that of PGR before deposition. Therefore, it is considered that Ru
is combined with oxygen in the air during flame-annealing and is deposited
on the PGR surface as an oxide. Pt was deposited on the surface as
a zero-valent metal.

The chemical-bonding condition results by
XPS of PGR, Pt/PGR, and
RuOx/PGR are shown in Figures 3 and 4. In order to investigate the state of chemical bonding of Pt and
RuOx with the PGR, catalysts were deposited
on a quartz substrate and compared with the XPS results on the PGR. Figure 3a shows the survey
of PGR, Pt/quartz, and reference Pt/PGR from 0 to 1000 eV. Similarly,
the XPS survey of PGR, RuO2 (reference), RuOx/quartz, and RuOx/PGR
is shown in Figure 3a. The without-catalyst PGR shows conspicuous peaks of C 1s and O
1s (Figure 3a). Hence,
carbon and oxygen are the main components of the PGR as observed by
EDX and XPS. In Pt/PGR, peaks of Pt 5p; 52 eV, 4f7/2; 71
eV, 4f5/2; 74 eV, 4d5/2; 315, 4d3/2; 332 eV, and 4p3/2; 520 eV are shown in Figure 3a–c. These Pt peaks
were considered to be zero-valent metal that is not bonded to other
elements.17,18 In addition, the C 1s peak decreased (Figure 3d), which is due
to the Pt covering on the PGR surface.19−21 Similarly, the O 1s
peak of Pt/PGR also decreased (Figure 3e). Because no conspicuous shift of the oxygen peak
was observed, it was considered that Pt was not bonded with oxygen
(Figure 3e). In addition,
Pt peaks of Pt/PGR and Pt/quartz were quite similar (Figure 3a–c). For C 1s and O
1s, Pt chemical bonding was not conspicuously changed between the
PGR or quartz glass substrate (Figure 3d,e). This suggested that the state of the Pt catalyst
was not particularly affected by the substrate.

Figure 4 XPS spectra of RuOx/PGR: (a) survey;
(b) Ru 3d/C 1s; (c) Ru 3p; and (d) O 1s.

In RuOx/PGR, peaks of Ru 4p; 45 eV,
3d5/2; 280–283 eV 3d3/2; 284–286
eV, 3p3/2; 462 eV, 3p1/2; 484–497 eV
3s; 588 eV, and MVV; 980 eV are shown in Figure 4a–c. On comparison with RuO2 reference, it was considered that RuO2 was formed on
the PGR and quartz by flame-annealing (Figure 4b).17,22 Ru 3p3/2 and 3p1/2 were observed between 460 and 500 eV (Figure 4c). The peak near
497 eV in RuOx/PGR and RuOx/quartz was considered to be shifted to Ru 3p1/2 due to RuO4 from several refs (23−25). From Figure 4d, the O 1s peak shifted when comparing PGR with others. From
the above observations, RuO2 was formed mainly by flame-annealing,
and the presence of RuO4 was also suggested.

The
atomic-bonding conditions between Pt, Ru, carbon, and oxygen
on the PGR were analyzed using TEY and TFY-NEXAFS by soft X-ray irradiation.
The results of Pt/PGR and RuOx/PGR are
shown in Figures 5 and 6. Figures 5a,c and 6a,c show the results of the
TEY method, and Figures 5b and 6b show the results by the TFY method.
The TEY method is sensitive to the outermost surface; on the other
hand, the TFY method is a bulk-sensitive measurement. In the PGR,
π* (=C) and σ* (−C) peaks were observed
at about 285.5 and 293 eV, respectively, indicating sp2 of graphite.26−30 In TEY C K-edge of Pt/PGR and RuOx/PGR,
π* and σ* peaks of graphite were hardly confirmed (Figures 5a and 6a). However, at TFY C K-edge, peaks of π* and σ*
were noticeable, confirming that Pt and RuOx covered the PGR surface (Figures 5b and 6b), uniformly.
The O K-edge of Pt/PGR and RuOx/PGR is
shown in Figures 5c
and 6c. In the PGR, peaks were observed at
532 and 538 eV, which are attributed to π* (=O) and σ*
(−O), respectively.31−33 In addition, because oxygen peaks
were not observed in the TEY spectrum of Pt/PGR, it was considered
that Pt does not combine with oxygen and exists as Pt of 0 valence.
In RuOx/PGR and RuO2, two peaks
in π* were observed, both of which had the same peak shape.
This XAFS result supports the XPS result, indicating the presence
of RuO2. From the results of EDX, XPS, and NEXAFS, it was
considered that Pt covered uniformly the PGR as the metallic condition,
and it had not bonded with carbon or oxygen. In RuOx/PGR, on the other hand, ruthenium and oxygen were combined
during flame-annealing, and it was thought that they were deposited
on the PGR surface as RuO2, mainly. Also, the relationship
between the deposited catalysts and the carbon of the PGR was not
suggested. From these considerations, it was found that flame-annealing
can coat Pt and RuOx on the PGR surface.
In addition, it was found that Pt was deposited as 0 valence metal
and that Ru became RuO2 on the PGR surface.

In order to investigate the catalytic activity
of each electrocatalyst
on the PGR, first, the results of activity evaluation by CV are shown
in Figure 7. In each
electrochemical measurement, Pt/PGR (20 s annealing duration, 5 times
dipping–annealing cycles) was used for HER electrodes, and
RuOx/PGR (10 s annealing duration, 5 times
dipping–annealing cycles) was used for OER electrodes. Pt/PGR
showed current improvement at lower voltage than the PGR (Figure 7a). Also, Pt/PGR
shows a CV curve similar to the Pt rod measured as a reference. From
the above, it can be said that the Pt-deposited PGR with high HER
activity using low amount of Pt catalyst can be easily produced by
flame-annealing.

and OER
polarization curves of RuOx/PGR, Pt rod,
and PGR (b) at a scan rate of 25 mV s–1 (vs Ag/AgCl)
in Na2SO4 (1 M) aqueous electrolyte.

Figure 7b
shows
the OER catalytic activities of RuOx/PGR.
The current rising voltage using RuOx/PGR
electrode was lower than that of the PGR and Pt rod. Hysteresis was
observed between forward and reverse potential sweeping directions,
which was considered to be the effect of the capacitance of the electrocatalyst
on the PGR with a large specific surface area.10 In addition, this capacitance effect did not change significantly
before and after catalyst deposition. This suggested that the catalyst
on the PGR surface did not have a porous structure, as observed by
SEM (Figure 2). From
the above results, it was revealed that OER activity was improved
by coating with RuOx on the PGR surface.
From the results of CV tests, it was found that electrocatalysts by
flame-annealing depositions can perform with high electrochemical
catalytic activity and be fabricated very easily in a short time with
less catalyst usage.

Optimization of flame-annealing time and
number of dipping times
into catalyst precursor solutions were performed for water electrolyzing.
The results are shown in Figures 7 and 8 for Pt/PGR and RuOx/PGR, respectively. For Pt/PGR, considering
the average value and variation of current density results, it was
decided that the optimal annealing duration and the annealing cycles
should be 20 s and 5 times, respectively. For RuOx/PGR, the optimal annealing duration and the annealing cycles
should be 10 s and 5 times, respectively. Excessive flame-annealing
reduced the catalytic activity of Pt/PGR and RuOx/PGR. Furthermore, because the increase of the current density
was not observed when the number of dips exceeded 5 times in both
cases, the optimal number of dipping times should be 5 times (Figure 9).

The catalyst weight and film thickness of Pt and
RuOx deposited on the PGR were estimated
from the following
calculations. The amount of catalyst precursor solution used was calculated
from the reduced weight of the precursor solution used for catalyst
deposition on the PGR. The consumed amount of precursor solution by
5 times dipping–annealing cycles was 0.067 mg for Pt and 0.043
g for RuOx, respectively. The concentrations
of PtCl6·6H2O and Ru(NO)(NO3)3 used were 0.039 mol L–1 and 0.05
mol L–1, respectively (solvent: PtCl6·6H2O is ethanol; Ru(NO)(NO3)3 is deionized water). Because PtCl6·6H2O was changed to Pt and Ru(NO)(NO3)3 to RuO2, the deposition amounts of Pt and RuO2 were calculated
from the molecular weights before and after the change. The molecular
weight of each is PtCl6·6H2O; 517.9, Pt;
195.1, Ru(NO)(NO3)3; 317.1, and RuO2; 133.1. Next, the amount of Pt and RuO2 deposited per
unit area (cm2) was calculated. The amount of catalyst
deposited per unit surface area was calculated in two patterns, in
consideration of the apparent surface area and the mesoscopic surface
area. Apparent surface area: 2.54 cm2 {the apparent surface
area of the PGR (cylinder) was calculated as follows; S = πr2 + 2πrh (S; apparent surface area, π; ratio of the
circumference of a circle to its diameter, r = radius, h = height)} and mesoscopic surface area: from Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
studies in our previous paper; the PGR has a specific surface area
of 3.3 m2 g–1.10 Because the PGR is 0.25 g at a length of 4 cm, the specific surface
area possessed by 4 cm PGR is 0.825 m2 (8250 cm2). The catalyst deposition amount is divided by these surface areas
to obtain Pt, RuO2 deposition amount per unit area. An
approximate film thickness was calculated from the density of Pt and
RuO2. Density of the formed substance: Pt 21.45 g cm–3 and RuO2 6.97 g cm–3. The above calculations are summarized below  Surface area [cm2]*; apparent surface
area: 2.54 cm2, and mesoscopic surface area: 8250 cm2.  

Table 2 shows the
catalyst deposition amount and film thickness calculated by the above
calculations. The data in Table 2 show the case of 5 times dipping–annealing
cycles. The weight of the Pt and RuO2 deposited on the
PGR is calculated as about 0.25 and 0.36 mg cm–2 from the decrement of the catalyst precursor solution. The approximate
catalyst deposition film thickness was calculated by two patterns
in consideration of the apparent area and the mesoscopic structure.
The actual film thickness was expected to be between these values.
Hence, it can be considered that very thin nanoscale catalyst films
were deposited on the porous PGR as the mesoscopic point of view.

three samples and the average was calculated.).

Hydrogen and oxygen evolution rates
were observed using a two-electrode
cell with Pt/PGR and RuOx/PGR as HER and
as OER electrodes, respectively, and the Faraday efficiency was calculated.
The PGR electrode couple were also used for reference. It was confirmed
that the hydrogen and oxygen generation rates were both improved by
the presence of the catalyst (Figure 10a). Figure 10b shows the Faraday efficiency using PGR electrodes, and Figure 10c shows Faraday
efficiency using Pt/PGR and RuOx/PGR electrode
couple. In both cases, the Faraday efficiency of H2 generation
was high as around 95%. In O2 generation, however, the
Faraday efficiency using the PGR electrode was 45.4% and using Pt/PGR–RuOx/PGR electrode couple was near twice of the
Faraday efficiency as 89.2%.

water electrolysis using PGR electrodes; and (c) Faraday efficiency
during water electrolysis using Pt/PGR and RuOx/PGR electrodes. The electrolyte was Na2SO4 (1 M) aqueous solution.

The current variation with time during hydrogen and oxygen evolution
is shown in Figure 11a. Using the PGR electrode couple, the current value decreased rapidly
in 50 min. This current decrease indicates that the oxygen evolution
electrode has been destroyed by corrosion with the deterioration of
the electrode function. The photographs of the PGR anode during water
electrolysis are shown in Figure 11b. It was confirmed that the PGR electrode was broken
from the top with the time duration and was collapsed in 50 min, completely.
In the Pt/PGR–RuOx/PGR electrode
couple, on the other hand, a rapid decrease in the current value was
confirmed at 330 min. Similar to the PGR without catalysts, the anode
was destroyed with time duration and completely disappeared at 330
min (Figure 11c).
The increase in the current value of Pt/PGR–RuOx/PGR over 1–2 h was thought to be due to the
temporary increase in the electrode surface area due to electrode
breakage. Experiments with the two-electrode cell revealed that the
water electrolysis durability was improved using catalysts (Pt and
RuOx) on the graphite electrode. In particular,
the effect of the catalyst is remarkable on the OER, and it was found
that the durability of the anode is improved by coating RuOx. The corrosion destruction of this PGR anode will
be investigated in detail in the next paper.

In order to understand the electrochemical phenomena, EIS was performed
on PGR, Pt/PGR, and RuOx/PGR. The Cole–Cole
plots from EIS are shown in Figure 12. The equivalent circuit used for fitting is illustrated
in Figure 12a. Rs, CPE-T, and Rp represent the series resistance of the cell, the electrochemical
interface capacitance of the electrode surface, and the electrochemical
interface resistance of the electrode surface, respectively. Hence,
a lower Rp suggests higher electrochemical
catalytic activity. A lower CPE-P suggests the significant depression
of semicircle and the larger porosity of the electrode. The fitted
results are shown in Table 3. In this work, we have focused on the Rp value. In the HER, Pt/PGR shows 2.3-times lower resistance
value of Rp than PGR, which can be seen
that the water-electrolysis catalytic activity of Pt/PGR is higher
than that of PGR itself (Figure 12b). In the OER, on the contrary, RuOx/PGR showed 17-times lower resistance (Rp) than PGR, and it was confirmed that the performance of the
OER can be affected by the catalyst deposition on carbon electrodes
much significantly than that of the HER (Figure 12c,d).

Pt/PGR and RuOx/PGR were compared to
previously reported benchmarks and highly active base metal catalysts
(Table 4). For the
HER, the overpotential of Pt/PGR was −15.5 mV, close to the
benchmark Pt/C of −10.9 mV.34 In
the OER, the overpotential of RuOx/PGR
was 311.6 mV, which was close to 290 mV of the reference Ru catalyst.35 In addition, Pt/PGR and RuOx/PGR showed lower overpotentials as compared with the base
metal-based catalyst.35 When investigating
the overpotential due to the activity of the catalyst using the PGR,
it is necessary to pay attention to the capacitance effect of the
PGR, as shown in Figure 7. Also, in this study, the electrode reaction area was large (2.54
cm2); so, the overpotential was inevitably higher than
the reference. However, from these results, it is considered that
catalyst-deposited PGR can be used sufficiently for evaluating catalytic
ability.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, the flame-annealing
deposition methods for very
thin Pt and RuOx catalyst layers on very
cheap PGR electrodes and the water-electrolysis performance were described.
Using the very simple and short-time flame-annealing method, electrocatalysts
with high HER and OER activities were fabricated using quite low amount
of catalysts. By flame-annealing deposition, it was found that H2PtCl6 became a zero-valent metal Pt and that Ru(NO)(NO3)3 reacts with oxygen in the air and was deposited
on the PGR surface as RuOx. Pt/PGR and
RuOx/PGR electrodes showed high catalytic
activity for the HER and OER, respectively. Although the PGR anode
itself is not stable for the long-term stability test for the OER
in water electrolysis, the RuOx/PGR electrode
showed longer stability during the water electrolysis as the OER electrode.
In conclusion, the method of producing the electrocatalyst by PGR
and flame-annealing is extremely inexpensive and simple and can be
produced in a short time. Therefore, it is very effective for the
initial catalyst search and a very important technology in the development
of a catalyst requiring a large amount of trial and error.
