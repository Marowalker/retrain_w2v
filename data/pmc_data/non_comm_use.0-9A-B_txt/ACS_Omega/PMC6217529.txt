The current study
evaluates antidiabetic, anticoagulant, and antiplatelet
activity of novel benzimidazole-containing quinolinyl oxadiazoles.
These derivatives are synthesized and characterized using spectroscopy
(FT-IR, 1H NMR, and mass spectroscopy) and single-crystal
X-ray diffraction methods. The inhibitory effects of these compounds
were evaluated by the α-glucosidase inhibitory assay and shows
the activity in the range of IC50 = 0.66 ± 0.05 to
3.79 ± 0.46 μg/mL. In addition, molecular docking studies
revealed that benzimidazole-containing quinolinyl oxadiazoles can
correctly dock into the target receptor protein of the human intestinal α-glucosidase, while their bioavailability/drug-likeness
was predicted to be acceptable but requires further optimization.
On the other hand, compound 8a and 8d showed
anticoagulant activity as they enhanced the clotting time from control
180–410 and 180–390 s, respectively, in platelet rich
plasma and 230–460 and 230–545 s in platelet poor plasma.
Furthermore, only 8a showed antiplatelet activity by
inhibiting epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation, and the observed
aggregation inhibition was found to be 93.4%. Compounds 8a–f show nontoxic properties because of the non-hydrolyzing properties
in the RBC cells. In addition, 8a and 8d show anti-edema and anti-hemorrhagic properties in the experimental
mice. These findings reveal that benzimidazole-containing quinolinyl
oxadiazoles act as α-glucosidase inhibitors to develop novel
therapeutics for treating type-II diabetes mellitus and can act as
lead molecules in drug discovery as potential antidiabetic and antithrombotic
agents.

==== Body
Introduction
As one of the chronic
diseases, diabetes mellitus is expanding
worldwide rapidly. It is characterized by high blood sugar levels
for a longer period.1 This uncontrolled
hyperglycemia can cause serious damage to many vital organs in the
body, including the kidneys, heart, and nervous tissues.2,3 Postprandial hyperglycemia has emerged as a prominent and early
defect in type-2 diabetes and as a predictor of cardiovascular or
even all-cause mortality, as well as an independent risk factor for
atherosclerosis.4

The membrane-bound
enzyme, α glucosidase, is found in the
epithelium of the small intestine. It cleaves α-1,4 glycosidic
linkage at the nonreducing end of starch and disaccharides to release
glucose units. Diabetes is caused with increasing glucose levels in
the blood stream and relatively increases postprandial blood glucose
levels.5−7 Inhibition of α-glucosidase is involved in
the reduction of glucose absorption (rate) in the intestine and further
decreasing plasma glucose levels. With these properties, α-glucosidase
(therapeutic target) is used for the modulation of postprandial hyperglycemia
in type-2 diabetes.8 The inhibitors, acarbose,
miglitol, and voglibose, used to inhibit α-glucosidase are used
to control postprandial blood glucose levels in type-2 diabetic patients.9,10

Over the past decade, α-glucosidase inhibitors, such
as acarbose,
miglitol, and voglibose, have been used to decrease the postprandial
blood glucose levels in type-2 diabetic patients.9,10 Furthermore,
various studies show that the molecules which exhibit the α-glucosidase
inhibitor property are also used in treating cancer, HIV, virus, and
tumors.11−13 Therefore, the present scenario needs a proper designing
and synthesizing of better α-glucosidase inhibitors to enrich
the discipline of medicinal chemistry.

Blood plays a pivotal
role in supplying micronutrients and macronutrients
to different parts of the body.14 Meanwhile,
blood oozing out during a vascular injury leads to many consequences.
Thus, prevention of blood loss plays a major role in physiological
condition and the phenomenon is termed as hemostasis, which is a highly
regulated pathway.15 Some environmental
and genetic factors may alter the hemostatic pathway, which leads
to thrombosis.16 Thrombosis is nothing
but the generation of unusual clots in arteries and veins, which is
a major cause for death around the world.17 Whereas, antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents play a major role
in treating thrombotic disorders.18 The
present study finds the beneficial role of benzimidazole-containing
quinolinyl oxadiazoles on thrombotic disorders.

Several quinoline
derivatives show various pharmacological activities
such as antifungal,19,20 antimalarial,21 antibacterial,22 anthelmintic,23,24 anticancer,25,26 anticonvulsant,27 anti-inflammatory,28 analgesic,29 and antihyperglycemic activities.30−32 The quinoline derivatives isolated from natural systems have been
reported for potent α-glucosidase inhibition.33−36

On the other hand, benzimidazoles
have potency for the anti-inflammatory,
antisplasmodic, analgesic, antihistaminic, antidiabetic, antimicrobial,
antitubercular, antiproliferative, antitumor, anti-HIV-RT, anticancer,
antiulcer, and cyclooxygenase inhibitor activities.37−46 The benzimidazole derivatives also exhibited α-glucosidase47−49 as well as antidiabetic50 activity; hence,
it is important to obtain novel benzimidazole derivatives as antidiabetic
compounds. There are only limited studies of benzimidazole derivatives
used on α-glucosidase inhibitory (AGI) activity and cytotoxicity.51

It was reported that oxadiazoles act as
a potential class of α-glucosidase
inhibitors34,52,53 and are found to have pharmacological activities such as anticancer,54,55 antimicrobial,56−58 anti-inflammatory,59 anticonvulsant,60 antioxidant,61 and
antidiabetic.34,62 The recent report on 1,3,4-oxadiazole
scaffolds discusses potential antiproliferative agents.63−65

In view of the above observations
in the quest to design better
drugs for diabetes and thrombotic disorders in our current work, we
have synthesized benzimidazole-containing quinolinyl oxadiazoles and
subjected to anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and α-glucosidase
inhibition activities.

Results and Discussion
Chemistry
The
synthetic methods for benzimidazole-containing
quinolinyl oxadiazoles 8a–f are illustrated in Scheme 1. The synthesis of
precursors substituted quinoline-4-carboxylic acids 3a–b with various acetophenones, as shown in Scheme 2. Furthermore, key intermediates 7a–c were obtained initially from the core nucleus benzimidazole-5-carboxylates 6a–c that were efficiently synthesized by the “one
pot” nitro reductive cyclization reaction between ethyl 3-nitro-4-(substituted
amino) benzoates 5a–c and 5-bromothiophene-2-carbaldehyde
using sodium dithionite in dimethylsulfoxide. Interestingly, the “one-pot”
reaction was proceeded very smoothly, in short reaction time with
an excellent yield. The benzimidazole esters 6a–c were converted into the corresponding hydrazides 7a–c and then to highly functionalized quinolinyloxadiazoles 8a–f. All the studied compounds were synthesized by using the same procedure
and characterized by spectroscopic analysis.66,67 The solid-state properties of the target compounds are listed in Supporting Information Table S1.

Computational Screening (Structure–Activity
Relationship)
The docking study was implemented using AutoDock
4.2.6 software
for benzimidazole-containing quinolinyl oxadiazole derivatives and
acarbose against N-terminal domain of the human intestinal α-glucosidase.
The parameters of binding energy and binding mode of each compound
were carefully analyzed. Using these parameters, hydrogen bond interactions
and intermolecular interactions (π–π) with the
enzymes were identified. Docking studies corroborate the significant
interactions of all the in vitro active benzimidazole-containing quinolinyloxadiazole
derivatives with the active site (acarbose inhibition site) of α-glucosidase
enzyme. The docking scores also show positive correlation with the
experimental results, in general. The docking pose of compounds 8a–f was shown in (Figure 6 and Table 3). The docking study predicted that the quinoline ring
of compound 8d binds to enzyme forming π–π
stacking with the amino group of Lys776 and benzimidazole ring forms
π–π interaction with the amino group of Lys513
amino acid residue with the least binding energy of −8.45 kcal/mol.
The second most active in this series is compound 8a with
the least binding energy of −8.08 kcal/mol, in which quinoline
ring forms π–π interaction with the amino group
of Lys776 while benzimidazole ring forms π–π interaction
with the amino group of Lys513. Furthermore, the benzimidazole ring
of compound 8b forms π–π stacking
with the amino group of Lys513 with the least binding energy of −7.77
kcal/mol, and in compound 8f with the least binding energy
of −7.5 kcal/mol, the benzimidazole ring forms π–π
interaction with amino group of Lys513. At the binding site of a-glucosidase,
the amino groups of Lys776 and Lys513 residues construct the π–π
stacking interaction with quinoline ring and benzimidazole ring of
the ligand 8c, respectively. However, in the ligand 8e with binding energy −7.95 kcal/mol, no interaction
has been seen with amino acid residues.

In general, all the ligand molecules
except 8e showed
more promising results against α-glucosidase compared to standard
compounds. Hence, they may act as potential specific inhibitors for
this target enzyme.

Biological Evaluation
Antidiabetic Activity:
AGI Effect
α-Glucosidase
inhibition assay was carried out for the newly synthesized compounds 8a–f in vitro. All the compounds exhibited significant
α-glucosidase-inhibiting potential compared to standard acarbose
(IC50 = 1460. 28 ± 244.365 μg/mL). It was demonstrated
that compounds 8a and 8d had the best AGI
activity with IC50 values 0.66 ± 0.05 and 0.68 ±
0.02 μg/mL as represented in Table 4.

Plasma Recalcification Time
To pinpoint
the possible
role of 8a and 8d in the blood coagulation
cascade, plasma recalcification time was accomplished using both human
platelet rich plasma (PRP) and platelet poor plasma (PPP). Astonishingly, 8a and 8d displayed anticoagulant effect by enhancing
the clotting time of both PRP and PPP from control 180–410,
180–390 and 230–460, 230–545 s, respectively.
The supreme concentration consumed in both the cases was found to
be 35 μg and remain unchanged upon increased dose to 40 μg, Figures 7 and 8. Coagulation factors are responsible for blood clot which
is a physiological phenomenon, and the blood coagulation cascade could
be activated just to arrest the bleeding in the case of injury. It
involves several factors such as factor VIIa to factor XIIIa, which
mainly encompasses three pathways which are intrinsic, extrinsic,
and common pathways. Some genetic imbalance and some environmental
factors alter the normal coagulation system, which further leads to
thrombosis, a pathological phenomenon. Plentiful of anticoagulants
were reported from the biological sources and nanoparticles,14,68−71 but reports available on the anticoagulants from benzimidazole-containing
quinolinyl oxadiazoles are very rare.

Figure 7 Plasma recalcification time. 8a (0–40 μg)
was pre-incubated with 0.2 mL of citrated human plasma PRP/PPP in
the presence of 20 μL of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) for
1 min at 37 °C. CaCl2 (20 μL; 0.25 M) was added
to the pre-incubated mixture and clotting time was recorded.

Figure 8 Plasma recalcification time. 8d (0–40 μg)
was pre-incubated with 0.2 mL of citrated human plasma PRP/PPP in
the presence of 20 μL of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) for
1 min at 37 °C. CaCl2 (20 μL; 0.25 M) was added
to the pre-incubated mixture and clotting time was recorded.

Antiplatelet and Nontoxic
Properties of 8a–f
Furthermore, to ascertain
the role of 8a and 8d on platelets, these
were analyzed for platelet aggregation
assay using PRP with agonist epinephrine. Curiously, only 8a is able to inhibit the epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation
but not the 8d sample. The 8a sample inhibits
epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation of about 93% at the concentration
of 30 μg as shown in Figure 9. However, platelets are very much essential to stop
bleeding along with coagulation factors. Aggregation of platelets
leads to the formation of platelet plugs when blood vessels are injured.
Many physiological agents act as agonists such as ADP, epinephrine,
collagen, thrombin, arachidonic acid, and thromboxane to activate
platelets in order to arrest the blood by forming platelet plugs at
the site injury. No control over the activation of platelets leads
to pathophysiology of thrombotic disorders. Several antiplatelet agents
have been identified from the biological sources,72,73 but very few are studied from synthesized compound sources.

Figure 9 Platelet aggregation
was initiated by adding epinephrine as an
agonist of 8a. (a) Traces of platelet aggregation: trace
1 (epinephrine 5 μM); trace 2 (epinephrine 5 μM + 10 μg

of 8a). The values represent of three independent experiments.

Moreover, all the synthesized compounds of benzimidazole-containing
quinolinyl oxadiazoles 8a–f went unhydrolyzed
with RBC cells. Molecules 8a and 8d were
active in preventing hemorrhage and edema in experimental mice up
to the concentration level of 100 μg. The positive control, Daboia russelli venom, encouraged hemorrhage and
edema in experimental mice, suggesting its nontoxic property as shown
in Figure 10.

intradermal.

Conclusions
Benzimidazole-containing quinolinyloxadiazoles 8a–f were synthesized. The novel synthesized compounds were characterized
by spectral and analytical data and were screened for antidiabetic
and antithrombotic activity. The results are correlated with docking
studies. The molecular docking data provided positive correlation
with in vitro antidiabetic activity in comparison with the standards
revealed that these compounds can act as potential inhibitors. The
core nucleus benzimidazole-5-carboxylates 6a–c were efficiently synthesized by a “one pot” nitro
reductive cyclization reaction between ethyl 3-nitro-4-(substituted
amino) benzoates 5a–c and 5-bromothiophene-2-carbaldehyde
using sodium dithionite in dimethylsulfoxide. This “one-pot”
reaction was proceeded very smoothly, in short reaction time with
an excellent yield. Compounds benzimidazole-containing quinolinyloxadiazoles 8a–f showed good binding interactions with the target
enzyme with least binding energies. Therefore, these compounds may
be further evaluated and useful for diabetic treatment; on the other
hand, this study for the first time demonstrates that benzimidazole-containing
quinolinyl oxadiazoles (8a–f) are responsible
for anticoagulant (8a and 8d) and antiplatelet
(8a) properties. Furthermore, they exhibit nontoxic property
on RBC cells. Thus, they could play a major role in the treatment
of thrombotic disorders, thus providing a new scope in drug discovery.

General Procedure for the
Preparation of 2-(5-Bromothiophen-2-yl)-1-alkyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazole-5-carbohydrazide (7a–c)
A mixture of ethyl 2-(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-1-alkyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazole-5-carboxylate (0.1
mol), hydrazine hydrate (0.15 mol), and 20 mL of ethanol was refluxed
on an oil bath for 10 h. The excess solvent was then distilled off
under reduced pressure, and the concentrated solution was quenched
with ice cold water. The solid separated was filtered, washed, and
dried. The crude product was purified by recrystallization from ethanol.

Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction
Studies
The single-crystal
X-ray diffraction intensities collection and data process were carried
out using the Rigaku Saturn 724 diffractometer (Mo Kα radiation;
296 K) and CrystalClear software, respectively.79 Direct methods were used for solving the structure
(SHELXS), and refinement was made by the full-matrix least squares
method on F2 using SHELX.80 All the non-hydrogen atoms were exhibited
in the first difference Fourier map itself, in which all the hydrogen
bonds were geometrically positioned (C–H = 0.93 Å, O–H
= 0.82 Å) and a riding model with Uiso(H) = 1.2Ueq and 1.5Ueq(O) was used for the refinement. The geometry of the 6c is calculated using PLATON program.81 The ORTEP and packing diagrams were generated
using MERCURY.82Table 2 represents the details
of crystal structure and data refinement. Figure 2 represents the ORTEP82 of the molecule with thermal ellipsoids drawn at 50% probability.

Hirshfeld Surfaces Analysis
The Hirshfeld surfaces
computational analysis was accomplished to determine the intercontacts
in the crystal structure of compound 6c as shown in Figure 4, in which the intercontacts
of the intermolecular interaction were indicated by the red colored
spots over the Hirshfeld surface. The short interatomic contacts emerged
by the strong hydrogen bonds were indicated by the dark red spots
on the dnorm surface, while the light
red spots indicate the other intermolecular interactions. The intercontacts
with respect to di and de were plotted using 2D-fingerprint plot as shown in the Figure 5.74,83−86

Computational Screening
by Molecular Docking Studies
Protein and Ligand Preparation
The
N-terminal domain
of α-glucosidase protein in the human intestine (3CTT) was obtained
from PDB (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb). The bound ligands, heteroatoms, and water molecules were removed
from each of the protein molecules. Polar hydrogens and Gasteiger
charges were assigned after merging of nonpolar hydrogen atoms. After
preprocessing of the crystal structure, it was saved in the PDBQT
file format using ADT. Ligands were optimized and saved in SDF format
using Maestro 2D Draw (version 9.7). Using Marvin Sketch (ver 17.1.9.0; http://www.chemaxon.com), all
the SDF formatted ligands were converted to the PDB format and subsequently
to the PDBQT format in AutoDockTools (ADT)-1.5.6.

Molecular
Docking Simulations
AutoDock 4.2.6 was used
to carry out the docking simulations. A standard protocol for molecular
docking was performed. To validate drug–target association,
automated docking was performed with AutoDock 4.2.6.87 The grid map was set on the whole protein by AutoGrid 4
with grid dimensions to their maximum values. Ten independent genetic
algorithm runs were performed for each ligand. The resulted values
differing by <2.0 Å in positional root-mean-square deviation
show the most favorable free energy of binding. All torsions were
allowed to rotate during docking. Docked poses were visualized considering
a maximum cutoff distance of 3.0 Å for hydrogen bonds. Analysis
and visualizations were carried out using MacPymol,88 ADT, and PoseView.89

Antidiabetic
activity: AGI Effect
AGI assay was performed
by the hydrolysis of chromogenic substrate p-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopyranoside (PNPG) using a previously explained method
elsewhere.90 Newly synthesized compounds 8a–f each were dissolved in DMSO to obtain 1 mg/mL
stock solution. From 1 mg/mL stock solution, further dilution was
made into 0.1, 0.005, and 0.001 mg/mL using 0.1 M phosphate buffer
(pH 7) to find their IC50 values. Briefly, 100 μL
of reaction mixture in a 96-well microplate containing 40 μL
(0.0015 units) of α glucosidase enzyme, 50 μL of compounds,
and 10 μL of phosphate buffer (0.1 M) pH 7 was incubated at
37 °C for 20 min. After that, 50 μL of substrate (20 mM,
PNPG) was added. The reaction mixture was further incubated at 37
°C for 30 min, and immediately, 100 μL of sodium carbonate
(200 mM) solution was added for terminating the reaction. The reaction
blank was prepared by replacing compounds and enzyme with buffer.
Similarly, the control was prepared using buffer in the place of compound.
Also, sample blanks were prepared for each sample replacing enzyme
with buffer. The acarbose (50 mg) tablets were dissolved in buffer
at 10 mg/mL concentration and used as a standard. The absorbance of p-nitrophenol released was quantified by reading at 405
nm using a Thermoscientific Multiscan plate reader. The percent inhibition
of α glucosidase enzyme was calculated using the following formula.  The amount of sample required for the 50%
inhibition of glucosidase enzyme was represented by IC50 values.

Plasma Recalcification Time
Plasma
recalcification
time was measured as described by Quick et al.91 Different concentrations of compounds 8a and 8d (0–40 μg) were pre-incubated with 0.2 mL citrated
human plasma at 37 °C for 1 min. Clotting was measured after
the addition of 20 μL CaCl2 (0.25 M).

Preparation
of PRP and PPP
PRP and PPP were prepared
using the method described by Ardlie and Han.92 The concentration of platelets in PRP was conserved as 3.1 ×
108 platelets/mL with PPP at 37 °C.

Platelet
Aggregation93
Platelet
aggregation was performed in a Chronology dual channel whole blood/optical
lumi aggregation system (model-700) as described by Born et al.93 PRP was pre-incubated with various concentrations
of 6c (0–15 μg) in 0.25 mL reaction volume
mixture. The platelet aggregation process was initiated by addition
of agonists independently such as ADP and epinephrine.

Direct Hemolytic
Activity
Direct hemolytic activity
was performed as described previously.18 Concisely, packed human erythrocytes and phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) were mixed in the ratio 1:9. Different concentrations of compounds 8a–f (100 μg) were pre-incubated with 1 mL of
this above solution for 1 h at 37 °C. Then, the reaction was
arrested by adding 9 mL of ice cold PBS and centrifuged at 1000g for 10 min at 37 °C. Finally, the amount of hemoglobin
released was measured at 540 nm.

Edema Inducing Activity94
Edema inducing activity was performed
as described by Sannanaik Vishwanath
et al.94 Briefly, compounds 8a and 8b were injected at different doses (10–100
μg) for the selected group of five mice at the right foot pads.
After 1 h, mice were anaesthetized using diethyl ether, and then,
the hind-limbs were removed carefully at the ankle joint and weighed.
Saline (20 μL) was injected alone into the left foot serves
as control. Minimum edema dose was defined as the amount of protein
required to cause an edema ratio of 120%.

Hemorrhagic Activity95
Hemorrhagic
activity was performed as described by Kondo et al.95 Briefly, higher concentrations of compounds 8a and 8d were injected with saline into the selected
group of mice. Mice that received only saline act as the negative
control whereas a group of mice that received snake venom serves as
the positive control. After 3 h, all groups of mice were anesthetized,
and then, hemorrhage was noticed by removing the dorsal patch of skin
surface carefully. The minimum hemorrhagic dose was defined as the
amount of the compound producing 10 mm of hemorrhage in diameter.

Statistical Analysis
The data are presented as mean
± SD. Statistical analyses were performed by Student’s t-test. A significant difference between the groups was
considered if P < 0.01.
