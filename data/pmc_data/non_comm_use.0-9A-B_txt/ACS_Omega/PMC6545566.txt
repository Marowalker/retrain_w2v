Casein phosphopeptides are multiphosphorylated
milk peptides, which
can have anticariogenic activity and improve mineral absorption by
binding bivalent metal ions. The present study investigated phosphopeptides
in kefir because fermentation may lead to their enhanced release from
milk proteins. After selective enrichment by hydroxyapatite extraction,
phosphopeptides and their phosphorylation degree were identified by
matrix-assisted desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry
(MALDI-TOF-MS) before and after enzymatic dephosphorylation. Peptide
structures were determined by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography
coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–ESI–MS/MS)
revealing 27 phosphopeptides in kefir, including nine peptides containing
the motif pSpSpSEE, which binds minerals most efficiently. The majority
(18) of phosphopeptides were derived from β-casein, but only
three were derived from the most abundant milk protein αs1-casein. After simulated gastrointestinal digestion, MALDI-TOF-MS
analysis detected eight putative phosphopeptides in kefir, four of
which were assigned by UHPLC–ESI–MS/MS to αs2-casein124–133, αs2-casein137–146, β-casein30–40, and
κ-casein147–161. These results indicate that
kefir is a good dietary source of multiphosphorylated peptides.

==== Body
Introduction
Kefir is produced by milk fermentation
using either traditional
kefir grains, which are a complex mixture of microorganisms, mainly
yeasts, lactic acid and acetic bacteria, casein and polysaccharides,
or industrial mother cultures prepared from grains, or commercial
freeze-dried kefir starter cultures.1 Traditionally,
kefir consumption has been linked with health-promoting effects such
as anticarcinogenic, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory activities,
mainly attributed to the probiotic microflora and to its metabolites.2,3 Recently, peptide profiling in kefir revealed sixteen peptides originating
from milk proteins with established bioactivity.4

Casein phosphopeptides (CPPs) are a subgroup of bioactive
milk
peptides consisting of multiphosphorylated peptides, which can be
endogenously present in milk,5 or released
from precursor proteins by digestive enzymes,6 or by microbial enzymes during fermentation.7 CPPs can efficiently bind and solubilize bivalent metal ions such
as Ca2+, thus enhancing the absorption of minerals in the
gastrointestinal tract,8 improving tooth
enamel remineralization in the oral cavity, and buffering the plaque
pH.9 Indeed, it was reported that β-casein1–254P (P = phosphate group) and α-casein59–795P can bind 24 and 17 mol of Ca2+ and
phosphate, respectively. Besides, CPPs have even higher affinity to
zinc, iron, and copper.8 Calcium binding
strongly correlates with the presence of phosphorylated serine residues,
which are necessary to enhance the calcium absorption from the small
intestine.10 Dephosphorylated peptides,
in contrast, do not bind calcium.11 Calcium
dissolution by phosphopeptides is due to the calcium-binding capacity
of the phosphoserine (pS) residues, which form amorphous calcium-phosphate
nanoclusters.12 Furthermore, the phosphorylated
sequences make CPPs more resistant to gastrointestinal enzymatic digestion
so that they are suitable carriers for metal ions.13

Fermentation is expected to promote the formation
of CPPs during
kefir production compared to unfermented milk. It is therefore important
to include CPPs with their potential effects on remineralization and
calcium bioavailability in the evaluation of health-promoting effects
of kefir. Based on these considerations, our goal was to identify
multiphosphorylated peptides in kefir. Although liquid chromatography
coupled to tandem mass spectrometry analysis (LC–MS/MS) or
matrix-assisted desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry
(MALDI-TOF-MS) can efficiently achieve peptide profiling in milk and
milk products,5,14−16 multiphosphorylated
peptides are negatively discriminated in a complex peptide matrix.
During LC–MS/MS analysis, the negative charge of the phosphate
group leads to low ionization efficiency17,18 and ion suppression by nonphosphorylated peptides.19 For example, the list of 257 peptides previously identified
in kefir included only mono- or diphosphorylated peptides besides
nonphosphorylated sequences,4 although
multiphosphorylated peptides were also expected to occur. Among the
latter species, those containing the motif pSpSpSEE (pS = phosphoserine)
are the most capable of calcium binding and have, therefore, particular
biofunctional relevance.9 Enrichment of
phosphopeptides has been achieved, for example, by immobilized metal-affinity
chromatography, metal oxide-affinity chromatography with TiO2, ZrO2, Fe2O3, or Al2O3,20 or by hydroxyapatite.21 The present study used hydroxyapatite enrichment
prior to MS-based phosphopeptide profiling to improve the coverage
of multiphosphorylated peptides.

Although CPPs mainly act as
anticariogenic agents in the oral cavity,
they could also improve mineral resorption, if CPP structures are
actually present in the gastrointestinal tract. The extensive degradation
of bioactive milk peptides during digestion is well known, but gastrointestinal
enzymes can also form novel bioactive sequences.22−25 Even though CPPs are more resistant
to enzymatic hydrolysis than unphosphorylated peptides, subsequent
formation and degradation of CPPs during pancreatin treatment has
been observed.9 Therefore, our second purpose
was to monitor the formation and degradation of kefir phosphorylated
peptides during simulated gastrointestinal digestion.

Results and Discussion
Profiling
of Phosphopeptides in Kefir by MALDI-TOF-MS
To screen for
phosphopeptides in kefir, peptides were isolated and
phosphopeptides were enriched using hydroxyapatite extraction,26 which is based on the interaction of the phosphate
groups with Ca2+ ions of the hydroxyapatite.27 This method is particularly suitable to cover
multiphosphorylated peptides because the binding affinity increases
with the number of phosphorylation sites.21 The phosphopeptide fraction was then analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS, which
has been successfully applied before to identify (multi-)phosphorylated
peptides in milk.5

To confirm that
the detected peptides actually were phosphopeptides, MALDI-TOF-MS
analysis of the samples was repeated after enzymatic dephosphorylation.17Figure 1 shows a representative MALDI-TOF-MS spectrum after hydroxyapatite
enrichment before (a) and after (b) dephosphorylation. Signals that
were no longer detectable after the hydrolysis step were assigned
to a phosphopeptide structure and subjected to further analysis. The
disappearance of the phosphopeptide signal was accompanied by a new
signal with a mass shift of −80 Da or a multiple thereof corresponding
to an unphosphorylated peptide formed by the loss of one or more HPO3– groups. The resulting signal pairs are
marked by boxes of identical color in Figure 1. In total, 27 signal pairs were detected
(please note that Figure 1 highlights predominant signals only).

and (b) after (reflected spectrum) dephosphorylation. Boxes of identical
color mark the peptide pairs exhibiting a mass shift of −80
Da or a multiple thereof indicating the presence of a phosphopeptide.

Identification of Phosphopeptides
by UHPLC–ESI–MS/MS
In the next step, the amino
acid sequences of the detected phosphopeptides
were identified by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled
to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–ESI–MS/MS).
For this purpose, enhanced product ion mass spectra were recorded
using the m/z values of the dephosphorylated peptides
detected by MALDI-TOF-MS as the parent ion (Table 1). LC–ESI–QTrap-MS/MS analysis
determined 18 dephosphopeptide structures. Because the quality of
the LC–ESI–QTrap-MS/MS product-ion spectra of nine dephosphopeptides
was not sufficient, corresponding structures were definitely identified
by LC–ESI–QTOF-MS/MS analysis (Table 1, peptides no. 7, 12, 15, 19, 23, 24, 25,
26, and 27). Figure 2 displays the resulting MS/MS spectrum of the multiphosphorylated
peptide β-casein7–37 (Table 1, no. 26), with the relevant sequence scheme
showing the amino acid bond cleavage leading to the experimentally
detected fragments. As expected, y-ion residues predominated in the
LC–ESI–QTOF-MS/MS spectrum compared to b-ions.28 The multiphosphopeptide β-casein7–37 is a breakdown product of β-casein, which contains five phosphorylated
serine units and the sequence motif pSpSpSEE, which is most active
in binding minerals.8

triple-charged. Potential phosphoserine residues reported in the literature
are underlined.

a Phosphopeptide
profiling was achieved
by MALDI-TOF-MS using two complementary methods (A and B) after hydroxyapatite
enrichment, which were performed before and after dephosphorylation
to assess the phosphorylation degree. The sequences identified by
subsequent UHPLC–ESI–MS/MS analysis after enrichment
with hydroxyapatite and enzymatic dephosphorylation are shown in the
single-letter code and peptide masses are given in Da. Phosphorylated
serine residues reported in the literature are underlined (S) and cleavage sites are indicated by dots.

b Detected using method A.

c Detected using method B.

Sequence structures could thus be
attributed to 26 phosphopeptides
detected by MALDI-TOF-MS (Table 1). Additionally, chromatographic separation of the
dephosphorylated peptides revealed two different dephosphopeptides
with m/z 1461 eluting at different retention times,
which had not been distinguished by MALDI-TOF-MS. Subsequently, enhanced
product-ion mass spectra identified β-casein8–21 (Table 1, peptide
no. 13) and glycosylation-dependent adhesion molecule (GlyCAM)-122–33 (Table 1, no. 14). In total, 27 phosphorylated peptides could be identified
(Table 1). Finally,
MALDI-TOF-MS detected one peptide with m/z 3161.6
and the putative phosphorylation degree of 4, but the quality of UHPLC–ESI–MS
and MS/MS spectra was not sufficient for structural elucidation.

The mass of the detected phosphopeptides ranged between 1040 and
4636 Da; 14 out of 27 identified peptides were multiphosphorylated,
with two to five pS residues. The present results confirmed that hydroxyapatite
enrichment combined with the use of a suitable buffer is highly efficient
for the analysis of multiphosphorylated peptides.21 As shown in Table 1, also partially phosphorylated peptides were identified in
kefir, such as peptide GlyCAM-132–421P (no. 8) and
αs1-casein41–552P (no. 17), both
containing three possible phosphorylation sites. Additionally, β-casein10–211P and 3P, β-casein10–202P, β-casein8–213P, and αs1-casein64–781P were present, all with four possible
phosphorylation sites, and the β-casein15–374P with five possible phosphorylation sites. Nonphosphorylated or
partially phosphorylated caseins have been detected in the mammary
gland.29 In the presence of cations, such
as Mg2+, Ca2+, or Mn2+, casein kinase
catalyzes the phosphorylation of partially phosphorylated caseins
in the lactating mammary gland using adenosine triphosphate as a phosphate
donor.30 Furthermore, caseins could be
partially dephosphorylated due to the activity of alkaline phosphatase,
which is associated with a high somatic cell count.31

The identified phosphopeptides are breakdown products
of the main
milk proteins, such as αs1-casein (34% of the peptide
fraction in milk), β-casein (25%), κ-casein (9%), αs2-casein (8%), and GlyCAM-1 (Figure 3). The latter protein is a small phosphoglycoprotein,
also known as proteose peptone component 3 (PP3) or lactophorin, which
is the main component of the proteose peptone fraction of bovine milk
(approximately 25%).32 GlyCAM-1 contains
135 amino acids and five pSs (S29, S34, S38, S40, and S46), as shown in Figure 3. Phosphopeptides
found in kefir derived mainly from β-casein (64% of the identified
phosphopeptides), followed by αs1-casein (11%) and
GlyCAM-1 (11%), κ-casein (7%), and lastly, αs2-casein with one fragment (Table 1). These results confirmed β-casein as the preferential
substrate for microbial protein degradation during the transformation
of milk to kefir,4,7 even though αs1-casein is the most abundant milk protein.

Figure 3 Amino acid sequences
of milk proteins identified as parent proteins
of phosphopeptides in kefir in the single letter code. Arrows indicate
the released phosphopeptides (see Table 1). Phosphoserine residues are marked in red.

Potential Bioactivity of
the Identified Kefir Phosphopeptides
Caseins feature several
possible phosphorylation sites, namely
13 in αs2-casein, 9 in αs1-casein,
5 in β-casein, and 2 in κ-casein, which often occur in
clusters (Figure 3).
In particular, the high-polar acidic motif pSpSpSEE of CPPs shows
predominant bioactivity such as mineral binding, which is responsible
for the remineralization of tooth enamel, calcium absorption, and
calcium bioavailability.8,33 In our experiments,
12 peptide sequences deriving from the breakdown of β-casein
(8) and αs2-casein (1) contained the mineral-binding
motif (Figure 3).

Besides the typical cluster sequence, other peptide factors are also
important for the intestinal uptake of minerals, such as the total
negative charge, the total number of amino acids, the phosphorylation
degree, and the amino acid composition next to the phosphorylated
region.34,35 In fact, β-casein1–25 phosphopeptide was more active in promoting mineral uptake by human
tumor cells HT29 than αs1-casein59–79 phosphopeptide,36 even though αs1-casein, which is rich in serine/threonine, usually generates
peptides with stronger mineral-binding capacity than β- and
κ-casein.37 Specific secondary structure
motifs and the aggregation degree of CPPs in the presence of bivalent
cations are required to enhance mineral absorption.36 Previous studies have demonstrated conformational changes
of the peptide backbone during calcium binding for β-casein1–25 (loop-type structure of the residue R1 to E4, followed by three β-turns of residues V8 to E11, pS17 to E20, and
E21 to T24)38 and
for αs1-casein59–79 phosphopeptides
(loop-type structure of the residue E61 to pS67 and β-turn of residue P73 to V76).39 Despite the presence of the acidic motif, calcium
uptake was not evoked when the typical loop-like structure (N-terminal
region) in β-casein1–25 was absent, whereas
the lack of the C-terminal residues did not affect the activity.36 Thus, only the phosphopeptide β-casein1–21 found in kefir would effectively enhance the absorption
of calcium in the intestine. Nevertheless, studies on the enhancement
of mineral absorption by CPPs are controversial.40 In fact, a positive effect on bone mineralization has been
shown for β-casein29–41 in vitro, although
the peptide carries only one phosphorylated serine.41 Three phosphopeptides (Table 1, no. 2, 4, and 5) of the present study contain
a similar amino acid sequence.

Identification of Phosphopeptides
after Gastrointestinal Digestion
During gastrointestinal
digestion, CPPs could not only be degraded
but also newly released from their parent proteins. Thus, the present
study subjected kefir to simulated gastrointestinal digestion and
tested for phosphopeptides as described above.

After the simulated
gastrointestinal digestion of kefir, MALDI-TOF-MS analysis identified
eight peptide pairs before and after enzymatic dephosphorylation that
indicated the presence of phosphopeptides, including seven single-phosphorylated
and one double-phosphorylated peptides. Because of the poor quality
of the enhanced product-ion spectra of putative phosphopeptides generated
by UHPLC–ESI–MS/MS and LC–ESI–QTOF-MS/MS,
only four phosphopeptides were identified (Table 2), including two αs2-casein
breakdown products (αs2-casein124–133 and αs2-casein137–146), as well
as one β-casein- and one κ-casein fragment (β-casein30–40 and κ-casein147–161).
The low number of identified peptides may reflect either the low concentration
of CPPs in the digest and/or their low ionization efficiency. κ-Casein147–161 had been detected before in a casein-derived
byproduct after tryptic hydrolysis before and after simulated gastrointestinal
digestion.42 Additionally, Picariello et
al. found β-casein30–40 in a peptide mixture,
which survived the gastrointestinal digestion of casein in vitro.43 Although the list of phosphopeptides after simulated
gastrointestinal digest is not comprehensive, these results indicate
that phosphopeptides can be released from precursor proteins and peptides
in the gastrointestinal tract after the ingestion of kefir. It has
to be considered, however, that brush border enzymes at the intestinal
microvilli including proteases and phosphatases are not covered by
the applied model of gastrointestinal digestion and may further modify
the phosphopeptide profile after digestion in vivo. Still, a certain
stability of CPPs during digestion has been recently demonstrated
when phosphorylated casein fragments were detected in the human plasma
after the consumption of cheese.44 Furthermore,
increased calcium-binding capacity compared to goat milk was observed
for goat kefir after in vitro digestion but not directly after production,
indicating that CPPs were released during the simulated digest.45

Conclusions
The
present study demonstrated that multiphosphorylated casein
peptides are present in kefir. Because CPPs are strong chelators for
bivalent metal ions, the detected phosphopeptides may thus exert anticariogenic
activity. Moreover, kefir-derived phosphorylated peptides were detected
after digestion in vitro, indicating that they may also influence
mineral absorption. Thus, the discussion of various health-promoting
effects of kefir should also consider CPPs. Further studies are required,
however, to determine the role of kefir-derived phosphopeptides in
the oral cavity or in the gastrointestinal tract for mineral absorption
in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Materials and Reagents
Hydroxyapatite
(CHT Ceramic
Type I, 40 μm) was purchased from Bio-Rad (Munich, Germany).
Formic acid (LC–MS grade), potassium chloride, 85% o-phosphoric
acid, ammonium hydrogen carbonate, 4-chloro-α-cyanocinnamic
acid, and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(Taufkirchen, Germany). Acetonitrile (LC–MS grade) was purchased
from Honeywell Fluka (Seelze, Germany) and 1,4-dithiothreitol was
purchased from Carl Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane
hydrochloride and ammonia (25%) were purchased from Acros Organics
(Geel, Belgium) and urea was purchased from Merck Millipore (Darmstadt,
Germany). Alkaline phosphatase (1500 U, grade I) from calf intestine
was purchased from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). Purified
water was taken from a Milli-Q system (Merck Chemicals, Darmstadt,
Germany).

Three different kefir batches of the same brand were
purchased from a local supermarket. The kefir was industrially produced
from pasteurized and homogenized low-fat organic cow milk (1.5%) using
a complex culture of yeast and lactic acid bacteria.

Sample Preparation
After centrifuging the kefir sample
at 3850 rpm and 4 °C, for 30 min, to separate caseins and other
insoluble components, the supernatant was passed through a sterile
membrane filter (0.22 μm; Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). The water-soluble
fraction was divided into aliquots of 5 mL and frozen at −80
°C until use. For UHPLC–ESI–MS/MS, the aliquots
were filtered once more using centrifugal filter units with 10 kDa
molecular weight cutoff (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) at 12 000
rpm and 4 °C, for 90 min, and stored at −80 °C until
use.

Phosphopeptide Enrichment by Hydroxyapatite Extraction
Phosphopeptide enrichment was carried out according to an established
protocol26 with some modifications. Briefly,
the sample was incubated with hydroxyapatite for 15 min at room temperature
in a thermomixer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at 1000 rpm. Then,
it was centrifuged at 7500 rpm for 3 min. Identical centrifugation
conditions were applied for the washing steps. Then, 4 mg of the hydroxyapatite–phosphopeptide
mixture was dissolved in 240 μL of 5% phosphoric acid solution
to solubilize the phosphopeptides. Stage Tip extraction using C18
Empore Disk with 2–200 μL pipet tips (Eppendorf, Hamburg,
Germany) was performed as described before.23 The peptide fraction was eluted with 10 μL of acetonitrile/0.1%
formic acid in aqueous solution (60:40). The samples were extracted
in quadruplicate, and the eluates were combined to a final volume
of 40 μL and analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS either directly or after
dephosphorylation.

Dephosphorylation of the Phosphopeptide Fraction
Prior
to dephosphorylation, samples were vacuum-dried (SpeedVac, Thermo
Electron, Dreieich, Germany) and reconstituted with 50 μL of
0.4% ammonium bicarbonate solution (pH 9.0, adjusted with 25% ammonia).26 After adding 1 μL of alkaline phosphatase,
the sample was incubated at 37 °C, for 1 h, in a thermomixer
at 550 rpm. Following enzymatic hydrolysis, the sample was cooled
on ice, purified once again by Stage Tip as described above, and analyzed
by MALDI-TOF-MS and UHPLC–ESI–MS/MS.

In Vitro Digestion
of Kefir
Kefir was digested in vitro
as described previously.23 Briefly, the
samples were treated with α-amylase and mucin for 5 min, at
37 °C (oral phase). After adjusting the pH to 2–3, pepsin
was added and incubated for 2 h, at 37 °C (gastric phase). Finally,
pancreatin and bile extract were added, the pH was adjusted to 7 and
digestion was continued for 2 h, at 37 °C (duodenal phase). As
discussed before,23 this protocol differs
only minimally from the standardized protocol,46 mainly by the concentration of the inorganic salts and
the absence of organic additives. The standardized protocol had been
applied before to analyze the peptide release from low-fat caprine
kefir.47 After enrichment by hydroxyapatite
extraction as described above, phosphopeptides were identified by
MALDI-TOF-MS before and after dephosphorylation.

MALDI-TOF-MS
Analysis
For MALDI-TOF-MS analysis, samples
were mixed 1:1 with a matrix. The matrix consisted either of (A) 10
mg of 2.5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 1 mL of acetonitrile/2.4% o-phosphoric
acid aqueous solution (50:50) or (B) 5 mg 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid
in 1 mL of acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (60:40). Method
B detected some additional peptides, mainly in the lower molecular
range. Samples (0.7 μL) were spotted onto a MALDI target (Bruker
Daltonik, Bremen, Germany) and air-dried. Mass calibration was achieved
by a mixture (1:5) of Bruker peptide standard solution II and the
matrix. Analysis was performed on a Bruker Autoflex III MALDI-TOF
mass spectrometer equipped with nitrogen laser in the positive reflector
mode measuring a mass range of 600–5000 Da. The ions were time-delayed
(140 ns) and accelerated at a voltage of 20 kV. Each measurement summed
up 200–250 individual spectra generated manually from five
different spots.

UHPLC–ESI–QTrap-MS/MS Analysis
UHPLC–ESI–QTrap-MS/MS
analyses were performed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RS system (ThermoFisher
Scientific, Idstein, Germany) coupled to a 4000 QTrap mass spectrometer
(AB Sciex, Darmstadt, Germany) with an ESI source. Chromatographic
separation was achieved with an Acquity BEH 300 C18 column (100 mm
× 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm; Waters, Eschborn, Germany) at 30 °C.
The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution (eluent
A) and acetonitrile (eluent B) and the separation was conducted applying
the gradient −6.0–5.0 min 5% B, 5.0–25.0 min
5–42.5% B, 25.0–25.5 min 42.5–95% B, and 25.5–30.0
min 95% B with a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The sample volume was 20
μL. To determine the retention time and charge state of the
phosphopeptides previously detected by MALDI-TOF-MS, measurements
were carried out in the positive enhanced mass spectra mode with the m/z 400–1200 and 1100–2000 ranges. The ion
source voltage was set to 5000 V and declustering potential to 50
V. To obtain fragmentation spectra of the phosphopeptides, tandem
mass spectra were acquired in the enhanced product-ion mode, with
collision energies in the range of 20–30 V and collision energy
spread of 10 V. Nitrogen was used for collision-induced dissociation.
Acquisition of spectra with insufficient fragmentation was repeated
with 40 V collision energy and 10 V collision energy spread. Analyst
software version 1.6.3 was used for data acquisition and processing.

UHPLC–ESI–QTOF-MS Analysis
Phosphopeptides
were analyzed by microUHPLC (Ultimate 3200 RS, ThermoFisher Scientific,
Idstein, Germany) interfaced with an ESI–QTOF mass spectrometer
(6600 TripleTOF, AB Sciex, Darmstadt, Germany). A Triart C18 column
(100 × 0.5 mm, 3 μm; YMC Europe, Dinslaken, Germany) equipped
with a precolumn containing the same material, operating with a flow
rate of 30 μL/min and 35 °C column temperature was chosen
for chromatographic separation. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1%
formic solution (eluent A) and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic
acid (eluent B) and the separation was conducted applying the gradient
15.0 min 2% B, 5.0 min 2% B, 55.0 min 42.5% B, 55.5 min 95% B, and
65.0 min 95% B. The sample volume was 4 μL. Ion spray voltage
was set to 5200 V and declustering potential to 80 V. Nitrogen was
used as the collision gas in the MS/MS experiments for peptide sequencing.
Raw data were processed using PeakView (version 2.2, AB Sciex, Darmstadt,
Germany) and Protein Pilot (version 5.0, AB Sciex, Darmstadt, Germany).

Database Search
For structure identification, MS/MS
spectra were searched against the UniProt database48 by mMass (Open Source Mass Spectrometry Tool, version 5.5)49 and Protein Pilot software. Because peptide
sequences randomly generated by kefir microflora were scarce in the
online databases, we manually searched the phosphopeptide sequences
of known bovine phosphorylated proteins to achieve an unambiguous
identification. The amino acid sequences of phosphopeptides were obtained
by de novo peptide sequencing. First, a bovine milk peptide database
was generated by an ion fragment calculator in mMass software including
precursor, position, and mass of all possible peptides derived from αs1- (P02662), αs2- (P02663), β- (P02666),
and κ-casein (P02668), serum albumin (P02769), GlyCAM-1 (P80195),
and osteopontin (P31096) without enzyme restriction. Peak picking
was applied for signals with signal-to-noise ratios of four or higher.
The peptides were manually identified by comparing the m/z values of product ions determined in the experimental spectra with
the theoretical m/z values of product ions of all
possible sequences in the database with the same m/z value of the precursor ion. Mass tolerance was set to 0.2 Da for
precursor-ion spectra and 0.2 and 0.02 Da for product-ion spectra.
Only peptides identified in all three kefir batches were included.
