The partitioning of compounds between
aqueous and other phases is important for predicting toxicity. Although
thousands of octanol–water partition coefficients have been
measured, these represent only a small fraction of the anthropogenic
compounds present in the environment. The octanol phase is often taken
to be a mimic of the inner parts of phospholipid membranes. However,
the core of such membranes is typically more hydrophobic than octanol,
and other partition coefficients with other compounds may give complementary
information. Although a number of (cheap) empirical methods exist
to compute octanol–water (log kOW) and hexadecane–water (log kHW) partition coefficients, it would be interesting to know whether
physics-based models can predict these crucial values more accurately.
Here, we have computed log kOW and log kHW for 133 compounds from seven different pollutant
categories as well as a control group using the solvation model based
on electronic density (SMD) protocol based on Hartree–Fock
(HF) or density functional theory (DFT) and the COSMO-RS method. For
comparison, XlogP3 (log kOW) values were
retrieved from the PubChem database, and KowWin log kOW values were determined as well. For 24 of these compounds,
log kOW was computed using potential of
mean force (PMF) calculations based on classical molecular dynamics
simulations. A comparison of the accuracy of the methods shows that
COSMO-RS, KowWin, and XlogP3 all have a root-mean-square deviation
(rmsd) from the experimental data of ≈0.4 log units, whereas
the SMD protocol has an rmsd of 1.0 log units using HF and 0.9 using
DFT. PMF calculations yield the poorest accuracy (rmsd = 1.1 log units).
Thirty-six out of 133 calculations are for compounds without known
log kOW, and for these, we provide what
we consider a robust prediction, in the sense that there are few outliers,
by averaging over the methods. The results supplied may be instrumental
when developing new methods in computational ecotoxicity. The log kHW values are found to be strongly correlated
to log kOW for most compounds.

1 Introduction
The chemical properties, biochemical interference, and biopersistence
of environmental pollutants are critical factors for toxicology programs
and strategies such as the REACH program and Tox21c.1−3 It is necessary to label, classify, and predict toxicological properties
of chemicals so as to develop evidence-based environmental health
and safety (EHS) standards for new and emerging compounds.4−6 As many new and emerging compounds and pollutants are known to pose
serious environmental and health risks,7 effective and inexpensive modes of the assessment of chemical and
toxicological properties are required. In this study, we use a number
of computational chemistry methods to estimate the octanol–water
(log kOW) and hexadecane–water
(log kHW) partition coefficients in order
to get insight into membrane permeability. The modeling methods are
applied to 133 compounds from the following categories: haloalkanes,
haloaromatics, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polycyclic
biphenyls (PCBs), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), parabens (PRBs),
and phthalates (PHTs). All of these compounds belong to ubiquitous
pollutant categories.7

The log kOW value approximates a compound’s potential
to partition into membranes, which is indirectly related to toxicity,
because for most modes of action compounds have to cross a cell membrane.
log kOW values therefore represent a cornerstone
in pharmaceutical as well as environmental chemistry and toxicology,
and it is important to determine log kOW for pollutants. Indeed, a toxicity profile including log kOW has to be determined before a chemical is
allowed to enter the market in Europe, the United States of America,
and Japan.8 However, for many emerging
pollutants, the log kOW have not been
resolved,9 and questions on their toxicity
as well as regulatory decisions are still pending.10−13 In addition, there have been
reports of disagreements in log kOW measurements.8 Indeed, experimental numbers for physicochemical
observables may need more scrutiny in general.14 A number of recent experimental studies have focused on
the compound classes studied here, for example, Quinn et al. studied
partitioning of PCBs into different phases,15 while Xiang and co-workers focused on log kOW of perfluorated carboxylic acids,16 but for numerous compounds no reliable measurements are available.
In general, the error in experimental measurements of log kOW varies from 0.1 to 1 log units.17

There is a large body of work related
to measurement or prediction of log kOW based on, for instance, quantitative structure–property relationships
(QSPRs).18,19 Although efforts into developing better
experimental methods are ongoing,20 more
research is focused on computational predictions ranging from coarse-grained
simulations21 to analytical reference interaction
site model theory,22 to quantum chemistry,23 to machine learning24,25 and other empirical methods.26,27 Interestingly, log kOW have been used to parameterize models for
dissipative particle dynamics simulations as well.28 Simultaneously, there are still new efforts to measure
new physicochemical data including log kOW with improvement of QSPR methods being one of the reasons.29 This is important as experimental databases
are known to have errors in everything from names and structures to
physicochemical properties.14,30,31

Environmental and toxicological sciences can, in principle,
benefit from using the tools of computational chemistry to determine
log kOW values and other properties of
new chemicals to facilitate the differentiation of pollutants from
innocuous chemicals.23,24,32−39 In this study, we compare three computational approaches to calculate
log kOW of 133 pollutant compounds, and,
in addition, the log kHW are computed
using two of the methods. The results are compared to experimental
data as well as the XlogP prediction method40,41 and the widely used KowWin (kOW-Windows),42,43 which is part of the EPI Suite.44

2 Methods
One hundred and thirty-three compounds were
selected from seven pollutant categories, haloalkanes, haloaromatics,
PAHs, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), PFCs, PRBs, PHTs, and a control
category. All compounds and computed values are listed in Table S1. Initial 3D coordinates of the pollutants
were taken, if available, from the PubChem database directly,45 and if not available, the structures were built
manually using Discovery Studio 4.5 Visualizer, followed by AM146 and PM647 optimizations
in the gas phase using the Gaussian 0948 software. It should be noted that a varying number of the compounds
studied in this paper have been used for parameterizing the methods
used here. Experimental log kOW and log kHW values were taken from a number of sources
(Table S1). In some cases, the partition
coefficients were determined from the difference between solvation
free energies in water and octanol, alternatively water and hexadecane.49 Some of the log kHW were taken from Hafkenscheid and Tomlinson who specify that the
solvent is “aliphatic alkane”.50 All results can be visualized on the (http://virtualchemistry.org) website.51 It should be noted that many
papers in the literature refer to computed data as experimental or
even present log kOW without any reference
whatsoever.

2.1 SMD Calculations
Solvation model
based on electronic density (SMD) calculations were performed with
the Gaussian 0948 or the Gaussian 1652 software. Optimizations and frequency calculations
were carried out for all the pollutants in the liquid phase with SMD
solvent models (i.e., water, n-octanol, and n-hexadecane)49 and in the gas
phase separately at the HF/6-31+G(d,p)53 level of theory. The LANL2DZdp-ECP basis set54 was used for iodine atoms, as this has shown to yield reasonable
results in other studies.55 The abbreviation
Hartree–Fock (HF) will be used for these calculations in the
remainder of this work. In earlier work,56 a number of levels of theory were used, and it was found that both
HF and density functional theory (DFT) are predicting numbers that
are too low, which could be due to not only the basis set size applied
but also the method. In order to distinguish these two possibilities,
a further set of calculations was done using the BP86 functional57,58 (denoted as BP86 in what follows). The solvation free energy of
pollutant molecules was defined to be the difference in the free energy
of solute calculated in the liquid phase and in the gas phase.56,59,60 The partition coefficients were
computed from the differences in solvation free energy of each compound
in water, 1-octanol, and n-hexadecane. This approximation
ignores the fact that octanol is significantly hydrated, the solubility
of water in octanol being 48.8 g/kg at room temperature.61 The Minnesota solvation database62 has been used to develop and tune the SMD method,
and some compounds from the database are used here.

2.2 COSMO-RS Calculations
COSMO-RS, that is, the conductor-like
screening model for realistic solvation,63−65 is a quantum
chemically based approach to predict thermodynamic equilibrium properties
of molecules in liquids. It starts from polarization charge densities
of solute and solvent molecules, which arise if the molecules are
embedded in a virtual conductor. These can be efficiently calculated
using DFT combined with the conductor-like screening model (COSMO)66 which is available in most quantum chemical
programs. The TURBOMOLE program67 with
a Becke–Perdew functional57,58 and a TZVPD
basis set68 was used for these calculations,
together with the default COSMO parameters in TURBOMOLE. On the basis
of the individual COSMO results of solutes and solvent molecules,
the COSMO-RS method expresses the specific interactions of molecules
in a liquid system, that is, electrostatic interactions and hydrogen
bonding, pairwise, local interactions of surface segments quantified
by the COSMO polarization charge densities σ of the interacting
segments. By an efficient and accurate statistical thermodynamics
calculation for the interacting surfaces, the chemical potentials
and free energies of the molecules in pure and mixed solvents are
calculated. For the current project, standard COSMO-RS calculations
have been performed with the COSMOtherm program with the BP_TZVPD_FINE_18
parameterization.69 This means that the
conformations and geometries used in the COSMO-RS calculations for
the solutes and solvents were generated and handled as described in
Klamt et al.70 For compounds, for which
multiple conformations are relevant, in each solvent the free energy
is calculated from the logarithm of the conformational partition function,
leading to a multiconformational treatment which would be cumbersome
in methods like SMD. log kOW values of
16 of the compounds studied here were used in tuning the COSMO-RS
code.

2.3 XlogP3 and KowWin
The XlogP3 algorithm
first searches for the most similar compound in the database, and
if there is no full hit, the differences in the structures are accounted
for by an incremental method.41 The values
for the compounds studied here were downloaded from PubChem71 (Table S1). The algorithm
yielded a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 0.41 log units for
8199 compounds in the original paper.41 A significant fraction of the compounds studied here is in the training
set for XlogP3.

KowWin log kOW were
computed based on an empirical atom and fragment contribution method42 by the widely used EPI Suite.43,44

2.4 Potential of Mean Force Calculations
Rectangular
boxes containing 313 molecules of 1-octanol and 2627 water molecules
were built where the 1-octanol fraction was slightly solvated (see
analysis in Results and Discussion). This
box was equilibrated for 2 ns in order to obtain a stable biphasic
system. Pollutant input files were generated as described above. The
generalized Amber force field (GAFF72)
was used for 1-octanol and all pollutant compounds. Charges for the
pollutants were computed from the electrostatic potential using the
Merz–Kollman procedure73,74 in Gaussian 16,52 computed using DFT (B3LYP57,75−77) combined with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set.78−80 The compounds are part of the Alexandria database,31 and Gaussian log files are available for download at Zenodo.81 The TIP3P water model82 was used. The GROMACS 2016 software package83,84 was used for all simulations. Long-range Coulomb interactions and
Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions were treated using the particle-mesh
Ewald method (PME).85,86 LJ-PME was used because it has
been shown that the omission of long-range LJ interactions leads to incorrect
surface tensions of liquids87−89 and biological membranes86 and, in addition, has an effect on protein aggregation
at high protein concentrations in simulations.90 Constraints were used on all chemical bonds to hydrogen
atoms, applying the LINCS algorithm,91 allowing
a 1 fs integration time step. Temperature coupling in production simulations
was applied using the v-rescale algorithm92 with a time constant of 0.5 ps. The pressure was controlled using
the Parrinello–Rahman algorithm93 with a time constant of 10 ps, using the semi-isotropic scheme where
the direction orthogonal to the interface is coupled separately from
the other two directions. 2 ns simulations were performed “pulling”
the pollutant through in the 1-octanol water box (see Movie M1) perpendicular to the water/1-octanol
interface. We note that in the PMF method explicit water molecules
do enter the octanol phase and contribute to the energy profile as
discussed below. As the resulting numbers are in principle a property
of the force field only, they will be denoted GAFF-ESP because electrostatic
potential-derived charges were used.

3 Results
and Discussion
The prediction of log kOW values is summarized quantitatively in Table 1 for each of the classes of
compounds. The lowest rmsd from experimental data for all compounds
is obtained for XlogP3, COSMO-RS, and KowWin (all about 0.4 log unit),
followed by the SMD method (HF: 1.0 and BP86: 0.9 log units) and the
potential of mean force (PMF) calculations (1.1 log unit). Both SMD
methods systematically underestimate log kOW with a mean signed error (MSE) of ≈−0.6. The HF method
is known to overpolarize compounds;31,94 however, this
should not be the case for BP86, and therefore, there may be other
contributing factors. The GAFF-ESP calculations on the other hand
overestimate log kOW possibly due to lack
of explicit polarizability. The results are skewed slightly by outliers
in some of the compound classes, which will be discussed in some detail
below. The XlogP3 rmsd is low due to the fact that some of compounds
may be part of the database used for optimizing the algorithm. It
should also be noted that the experimental error varies between 0.1
and 1.0 log unit, with larger compound having larger uncertainty.17

The calculation times vary between less than a second for the QSPR
methods to minutes for COSMO-RS to days for the DFT and HF methods
to half a year for each of the PMFs. Although long calculation times
may preclude high-throughput usage of the methods, it is important
to establish the relative accuracies of the methods.

3.1 Control
Compounds
The control class consists of a number of small
polar and apolar compounds including aromatic compounds. They were
chosen to have a range of log kOW values,
including negative ones and known experimental values. All methods
except GAFF-ESP perform relatively well for this category with small
MSE (Table 1).

3.2 Haloalkanes
The haloalkane group comprised a set of
eight compounds (Table S1), for which log kOW predictions all yield high correlation coefficients
and low rmsd (Table 1). Interestingly, SMD yields an almost perfect correlation coefficient r2 of 0.98; however, all log kOW are overestimated by 0.42 log units, while, in contrast,
all other groups are underestimated systematically (Table 1). This result suggests that
there is room for improvement with the parameterization of the 1-octanol
solvent in the SMD model. The compounds chloromethane, chloroethane,
and pentachloroethane were also evaluated using GAFF-ESP, and these
are overestimated in all cases, in particular for 1,1,1,2,2-pentachloroethane.
The reason for this discrepancy is likely associated with the force-field
parameters, which are not specifically optimized for compounds such
as haloalkanes. Addition of a virtual site to model halogen bonding,
as present in other general force fields,95 might help resolve these issues to some extent.

3.3 Haloaromatic Compounds
log kOW for 12 haloaromatic compounds were predicted using the SMD and COSMO-RS
methods, and for three of these, 1-chloro-3-phenylbenzene and hexachlorobenzene
predictions were done using GAFF-ESP as well. The results (Tables 1 and S1) show an rmsd between 0.4 and 0.5 for all
methods. The rmsd for SMD-BP86 is slightly higher than the other methods
because of one compound, namely, 1-chloro-3-phenylbenzene (Table S1).

3.4 Polycyclic
Aromatic Hydrocarbons
It should be relatively easy to predict
log kOW for PAHs given their planar structures,
lack of substituents, and their limited number of geometrical conformations.
Indeed, our calculations display a reasonable agreement with empirical
data (Table 1) with r2 > 0.85 in all cases except SMD-BP86. However,
both SMD methods have a few severe outliers (−2 log units, Table S1). It may be that larger PAHs (>C16) which pertain higher log kOW values are more difficult to be predicted correctly using SMD as
a result of their aromatic moment across the large planar structures.32 1,2-Dihydroacenaphthylene and chrysene were
predicted using GAFF-ESP, yielding moderate overestimations in both
cases (Table S1), in line with the overall
trend (Table 1).

3.5 Polychlorinated Biphenyls
PCBs are predicted
quite accurately by all methods, in particular COSMO-RS. In the case
of SMD-HF, there is a MSE of −0.64 log units, −0.44
for SMD-BP86. Given that PCBs have been present in the environment
for a long time,7 there is a large amount
of data available and only two predictions are made here (Table 2).

3.6 Perfluorinated Compounds
PFCs have an antipromiscuous chemistry, which makes these compounds
associate with neither water nor octanol. This might lead to problems
in experimental assessments too. Our predictions for the few compounds
are quite close to the experimental values; however, the values in Table 2 vary a lot between
the methods used here, with large standard deviation for a number
of compounds. Hidalgo and colleagues96 recently
reported log kOW values computed using
SMD for medium-weight (up to 11 carbon atoms) linear PFCs and compare
the results to empirical log kOW from
the KowWin program.42−44 They question some of the experimental data and also
find systematic differences between the results obtained using purely
empirical methods and the quantum chemistry-based SMD results. GAFF-ESP
simulations were done for four PFCs from this set, namely, 1,1,1,2,2,2-hexafluoroethane,
1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3-octafluoropropane, 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoropropan-2-ol,
and 2,2,2-trifluoroacetic acid yielding overestimations of 1.2, 1.0,
1.4, and 1.1 log units from the experiment, respectively. The PMF
method with the used GAFF-ESP force field therefore does not improve
on the accuracy of the SMD methods or COSMO-RS.

3.7 Parabens
The log kOW for
PRBs are predicted accurately using COSMO-RS and for XlogP3 and KowWin
as well. For SMD, a large systematic deviation (MSE of −1.8
log units) was found using both HF and BP86 methods. To our knowledge
however, only one study has reported multiple theoretically predicted
log kOW values for PRBs.97 In that work by Casoni and Sârbu, the most accurate
method for calculation was found to be ACLogP, where methylparaben,
ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben were predicted with
a deviation of 0–0.22 log units compared with experimental
results from a study by Kitagawa and Li.98 From the study by Casoni and Sârbu, it can be concluded that
the larger the PRB molecule becomes, the higher the deviation from
the empirical results. The results for SMD based on either HF or BP86
point more to a constant offset, however. Five of the PRBs were also
studied using PMFs, namely, methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate, ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate,
propyl 4-hydroxybenzoate, butyl 4-hydroxybenzoate, and heptyl-4-hydroxybenzoate,
which gave a lower rmsd than SMD (1.2 log units) but opposite sign
of the MSE.

3.8 Phthalates
PHTs
turned out to be difficult to predict with an rmsd > 0.9 for both
SMD methods (Table 1). For COSMO-RS, this category displays the largest (positive) MSE
of all. The PHTs bear a ring moiety with two carbon chains attached
and have therefore a large number of degrees of freedom, which may
contribute entropically to the free energies of solvation and hence
to the high rmsd. Although the PHT category contains many relatively
large compounds, there is no clear correlation between molecular weight
and error in the prediction.

3.9 log kOW Predictions
Table 2 displays computed log kOW for 36 compounds. The averages over the five numbers are proposed
to be the predicted values because the rmsd for the average for the
compounds where there are experimental data is slightly lower than
any of the methods by itself. Inoue and co-workers reported predictions
of log kOW for some large PFCs100 using the KowWin program.42−44 Their numbers
are quite a bit higher than what is found here using SMD, but it seems
that the log kOW of this category of compounds
as well as PRBs and PHTs are underestimated systematically in SMD
(Figure 1). For PAHs,
the size-dependent underestimation is present for the SMD methods.
Nevertheless, there is a good correspondence between the methods,
and because of the physical approach used in SMD and COSMO-RS, it
seems reasonable to assume that the average numbers provided in Table 2 are good approximations.

Figure 1 Correlation
between experimental and calculated log P (residual)
for six methods separately for all the classes considered.

The PMF calculations described here allow water
to enter the octanol phase and in this manner influence the log kOW through preferential solvation or, in principle,
by binding alcohol groups in the octanol phase. An analysis of the
amount of water in the octanol phase yields no difference depending
on the solute: in all systems, approximately 6 ± 1 water molecule
is found in the octanol phase.

3.10 log kHW
log kOW partition coefficients have been used in environmental analysis
and for toxicity prediction for several decades, and various methods
for calculating and determining log kOW empirically have been devised. However, some studies101,102 suggest that relying solely on the solubility of a compound in octanol
and water may not yield a complete picture of the potential toxicity
of the compound. For this reason, we have also performed predictions
of the hexadecane (C16H34) water partition coefficient
log kHW (Table S1). C16H34 has a higher capacity to solvate
heavy apolar compounds, such as large PAHs and hydrocarbons and potentially
also PFCs.50

All computed log kHW are given in Table S1 alongside a small number (12) of experimental data points obtained
from the Minnesota solvation database62 (based on experimental data from, e.g., Abraham103) and from partition coefficients for water/aliphatic alkanes.50 Compared to these 12 data points, the predictions
are within 1 log unit for all compounds except for urea. Figure 2 shows the correlation
between log kHW computed using COSMO-RS
and both SMD methods. When neglecting one outlier, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,7-tridecafluoroheptanoic
acid, the correlations r2 = 0.72 for HF
and 0.76 for BP86, respectively, with rmsd between the two methods
of 2.4 (HF) and 1.1 (BP86) log units. Because both COSMO-RS and SMD
contain empirical elements, it is difficult to pinpoint what could
be the underlying reason for the discrepancies, but BP86 is much closer
to COSMO-RS than HF. It may be, obviously, that less effort has gone
into fine-tuning the parameterization of implicit solvent models for
hexadecane than for water and octanol. Nevertheless, COSMO-RS is known
to perform well for a range of solvents,104,105 while SMD also has been shown to outperform implicit solvent models
based on empirical force fields.56 Another
issue could be that the basis set is not sufficiently large for PFCs,
but evaluation of basis sets is beyond the scope of this paper.

Figure 2 Comparison
between log kHW computed using the COSMO-RS
(X-axis) and the quantum chemical method SMD (Y-axis) for the HF and BP86 methods.

Figure 3 shows
that the correlation plots for the PFCs, PRBs, and PHTs all have a
slope close to one but an offset of −3 to 4 log units. For
haloalkanes, haloaromatics, and PCBs, the difference between log kOW and log kHW is
small as it is for the hydrophobic (log kOW > 0) control compounds. The truly hydrophilic control compounds
are much more soluble in octanol than in hexadecane. For most PAH
compounds log kHW is slightly larger than
log kOW. These findings are in line with
the well-known result that more aliphatic compounds solvate more readily
in lipid bilayers.106 This suggests that
there is not a lot of extra information to be had from log kHW calculations (or measurements) if the log kOW is known already.

Figure 3 Comparison between log kOW and log kHW computed
using the quantum chemical method SMD-HF and SMD-BP86 as well as COSMO-RS
for all compounds. The green lines correspond to log kOW = log kHW, and it is plotted
to guide the eye.

4 Conclusions
Comparisons of empirical methods for computing log kOW have been published previously, including molecular
modeling studies107,108 and more approximative models.109−113 Bannan et al. used separate free energy of solvation calculations
in different solvents to obtain the log kOW.108 These authors obtained an rmsd of
≈1.6 log units, slightly larger than the value found here (1.1, Table 1). Although the number
of compounds is too small to draw any conclusion and the compounds
studied are different, it might be worthwhile to study whether the
biphasic system used here improves the predictive power. Benfenati
and co-workers compared KowWin to a number of other software packages
and found this package to be one of the most accurate ones.109 More recently, dos Reis and co-workers compared
different prediction algorithms in a statistical analysis and found
KowWin to be one of the most accurate ones.111 In contrast, Geisler et al., in a comparison of log kOW prediction for small compounds, found KowWin to be
quite a bit less accurate than COSMOtherm,112 which is more in line with the results presented here. It is of
interest that development of QSPR methods is ongoing,114 in part fueled by the finding that databases
used to derive older QSPR methods from needed to be curated.30

In this study, we have derived log kOW values for a large set of compounds from
different chemical classes using four computational methods. The quantum
chemical SMD approach and the COSMO-RS methods were used to compute
log kOW and log kHW for 133 compounds, while XlogP3 (log kOW) values were downloaded for reference and KowWin values
computed using the EPI suite. By taking the average over four to five
values, we provide what we consider accurate log kOW predictions for 36 compounds for which no experimental
data are available (Table 2). Because the number of available experimental data points
remains limited despite decades of measurements, we hope these numbers
may be of use in environmental toxicity applications. Of the three
methods used for the predictions, the SMD method systematically underestimates
log kOW, while COSMO-RS and XlogP3 overestimate
log kOW slightly. COSMO-RS yields the
most accurate predictions in the tests provided here.

For a
number of difficult cases, molecular dynamics simulations were used
to compute the PMF for transport through the octanol–water
phase. The method has an rmsd from the experimental data of ≈1.1
log units. However, if the large MSE (≈1.0 log units) is subtracted
from the results, the rmsd reduces to 0.8 log units. The finding that
the PMF method systematically overestimates log kOW could be related to a deficiency in either of the solvent
models, although the TIP3P water model is known to reproduce solvation
relatively well.104,105,115,116 Considering the computational
cost, PMFs are not competitive because the quality of the predictions
is not better than the cheaper methods. Of the other methods, SMD
is relatively expensive with CPU requirements varying from minutes
to days because of nonlinear scaling of quantum chemical calculations
with system size. DFT is more CPU-time efficient than HF. COSMO-RS
is quite a bit more efficient than SMD, while KowWin is virtually
instantaneous. Nevertheless, with the present quality of predictions,
it may be wise to apply more than one method. It should also be added
that our results should not be extrapolated to compounds with chemical
moieties far outside the range of compounds here.
