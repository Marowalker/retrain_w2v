mesoionic carbenes (MICs) having a chiral
sulfur functional group at the C5 position are easily available through
a CuAAC between chiral alkynyl sulfoxides and different azides. The
MICs form complexes with several metals (Au, Ag, Ir, Rh, and Ru) that
are enantiomerically pure. Moreover, enantiomerically pure MIC sulfinilimines
are obtained from the corresponding sulfoxide retaining the chirality.
Through this article, the participation of sulfoxide moieties in different
catalytic and chirality transfer processes, as well as in discovering
mechanistically new processes will be shown. The role of the sulfur
chiral moiety in catalytic cycloisomerization and cycloisomerization–dimerization
processes using Au–MIC catalysts is dual. The sulfur functional
group either stabilizes intermediates in the catalytic cycle, allowing
for the reaction to occur or significantly increases the selectivity
of the cyclization processes. 1,2,3-Triazole MICs having chiral sulfoxides
at C5 are extremely efficient in preparing chiral at the metal complexes
by C–H insertion processes. The chiral at the metal half-sandwich
complexes, having the enantiopure sulfur chiral group unaltered, experiences
different reactions with complete retention of the configuration.
Finally, mechanistically new processes, like the desulfinilation of
1,2,3-triazolium salts in Ag–MIC complexes have been uncovered.
These still-nascent classes of compounds will offer opportunities
for the discovery of novel catalytic applications and to study new
mechanistically sound processes.

1 Introduction
The preparation of stable
carbenes I in 1988 by Bertrand1 and the
subsequent report by Arduengo describing
the synthesis of the first stable N-heterocyclic
carbenes (NHCs) II (Figure 1)2 in 1991 opened up an entirely
new research field. Stable carbenes3 have
found extensive application in fields as diverse as organocatalysis,4 medicinal,5 or materials
chemistry.6 However, it is in their use
as ligands for transition metals that these species are important.7 In fact, their availability and the possibilities
of modification of the structure including steric electronic properties
of the carbene ligands allow the modulation of the electronic properties
of the metal center. This fact is essential in the efficient use of
transition metal complexes having carbene ligands in catalysis.

Figure 1 Three examples
of stable carbenes.

In this regard, Albretch8 introduced
1,2,3-triazolilylidene carbenes III as a new type of mesoionic carbene
(MIC) in 2008. Since precursor heterocycles for these MICs are prepared
through the efficient and regioselective Cu(I)-catalyzed Huisgen cycloaddition
(CuAAC) between a terminal alkyne and an azide,9 these ligands can be prepared almost “a la carte”
to fulfill specific electronic and steric properties (Scheme 1). The CuAAC allows for the
placement in the 1,2,3-triazole ring of a large number of functional
groups that can be introduced in the core of the heterocycle through
the terminal alkyne, the azide, or both. The MIC ligand is coordinated
to different transition metals using several procedures. The most
frequent method uses the coordination to silver to form the corresponding
Ag–MIC followed by transmetalation. Therefore, the last 10
years have witnessed an explosive outgrowth in the preparation of
new structural types of MICs and their use as ligands in transition-metal-mediated
catalysis.10

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Metal-Stabilized
1,2,3-Triazolilyliden Carbenes
In spite of the fact that sulfoxides are the alternative choice
when considering the scarce chiral functional groups based on elements
different from the chiral-carbon groups,11 its incorporation in a 1,2,3-triazolylidene MIC following a CuAAC
reaction was unknown at the beginning of our work in this field. The
precursors of these heterocycles, namely the enantiopure ethynyl sulfoxides
are easy to make through the Andersen method, which involves the reaction
between acetylenic Grignard reagents and enantiopure menthyl sulfinate
(Scheme 2).12 Nevertheless, placing an enantiomerically pure
sulfoxide moiety in a 1,2,3-triazolylidene carbene requires several
problems to be addressed. The main concern was the configurational
stability of the sulfoxide center in the conditions required to synthetize
the heterocycle. Other problems may arise from the compatibility of
the sulfoxide moiety with the strong alkylating agents required to
obtain the 1,2,3-triazolylidene precursor,13 and finally the coordinating nature of the sulfoxide moiety may
compete with the emerging carbene during the coordination of such
ligands to the metal.

Scheme 2 Andersen’s Synthesis of Enantiopure
Ethynyl Sulfoxides
This perspective will
present the solution of these problems, the
extension of this approach to triazole containing sulfoximines, the
scarce examples of triazolilylidene carbenes containing sulfur-based
chiral (enantiopure or racemic) functional groups, and their emerging
applications in catalysis.

2 Synthesis
Hybrid
ligands composed of classic NHCs and sulphur-based functional
groups have been repeatedly investigated.14 Placing hemilabile functional groups based on sulphur into a 1,2,3-triazolilylidene
heterocyclic system is straight due to the versatility of the CuAAC
process, where the sulphur functional group may be introduced either
through the azide, the alkyne, or both. Following this approach, several
1,2,3-triazolilylidenes having aliphatic thioether moieties at the
C4 of the triazole core were prepared.15 Metalation (Pd, Rh, Au) of these compounds showed no coordination
of the pendant thioether to the metal center. The synthesis of thioether
functionalized ligands 1-[2-(methylthio)phenyl]-4-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazole and 3-methyl-1-[2-(methylthio)phenyl]-4-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-5-ylidene) has been also reported.16

Sarkar reported in 2014 the first heteroleptic
ligand formed by
an aromatic thioether and one 1,2,3-triazolilylidene MIC.17 Thus, Ir complex 1, and Ru and
Os-complexes 2 were prepared from the corresponding 1,2,3-triazolium
salts using the sequence Ag-complexation–transmetalation on
the C5-position of the heterocycle, with the concomitant coordination
of the arylthioether group. This route provided the desired complexes
in high yields (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Complexes Having 1,2,3-Triazolilydenes with Aromatic
Thioether MICs as Ligands
Contrary to sulphide-containing
NHCs,14 the NHCs having sulfoxide functional
groups have been much less
studied. The first example of a metal–NHC complex having a
sulfoxide was the CSC-pincer compound 3 reported by Huyhn.18 This NHC-pincer ligand has the sulfoxide group
as a bridge of two dibenzimidazolium salts. The synthetic approach
to ligand 4 involved the oxidation of the sulphide group
of compound 5 using H2O2. Subsequent
reaction with Pd(OAc)2 in dimethyl sulfoxide at 80 °C
afforded the pincer complex 3. It should be noted that
the sulphoxide group of 3 did not coordinate the Pd-center
(X-ray) (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Synthesis of Pseudo Pincer 3
Cardenas reported19 the synthesis of
Pd-imidazolilylidenes having a sulfoxide moiety in a chain attached
to N3. Thus, alkylation of imidazoles 6 with racemic
bromosulphoxide 7 under microwave irradiation conditions
(MW) formed imidazolium salts 8 that were coordinated
to Pd using Ag2O in MeCN to form complexes 9 (Scheme 5). The structure
of complexes [9aNCMe]+ and (9d)2 were unambiguously determined by X-ray diffraction.
The Pd complex [9aNCMe]+ has a nondistorted
square-planar geometry with a distance between Pd and S atoms of 3.34(2)
Å, which is lower than the sum of van der Waals radii, suggesting
a weak interaction between both centers, while the sulfoxide moiety
of the dimeric complex (9d)2 shows no interaction
between the sulfoxide group and the metal center.

Scheme 5 Synthesis of Palladium
Sulfinyl Imidazolilydenes
It should be noted that in the examples above, the sulfoxide moiety
is racemic. At the beginning of our work, procedures to prepare enantiomerically
pure 1,2,3-triazolilylidene ligands having chiral sulfoxide moieties
were unknown. We devised a methodology suitable to access different
enantiomerically pure 1,2,3-triazolilyliden-ligands having in mind
the possibility of introducing diversity20 in the prepared molecules. Within this scheme, considering that
the reagents have to be easily available and that the reaction to
be used to build the heterocyclic ring will be the CuAAC between one
alkynylsulfoxide and one azide, the following structural variants
in the reagents can be taken into account (Scheme 6):The nature of the ethynyl sulfoxide (a).

The nuclearity (c).

into the regiochemistry of the AAC) (e).



Scheme 6 Structural Diversity in the Synthesis of Enantiopure Sulfinyl 1,2,3-Triazolilydenes
Routes (a) and (b) shown in Scheme 6 were tested by synthetizing
enantiopure 1,2,3-triazole-containing
sulfoxide moieties by the reaction of alkynylsulfoxides 10 and azides 11. Examples shown in Scheme 7 demonstrate that the synthesis of triazoles 12 is compatible with alkyl and aryl azides as well as with
differently substituted sulfoxides. Especially relevant in these experiments
was the preparation of triazoles containing an additional chiral center.
One single enantiomer was obtained in both cases confirming that the
stereochemistry of both centers was maintained during the cycloaddition
process.21 Methylation of triazoles 12 occurred uneventfully in the presence of Me3OBF4, and the gold complexes 13 were prepared
through the corresponding silver carbene complexes as intermediates
(Ag2O, NMe4Cl) and subsequent transmetalation
with [AuCl(Me2S)]. Yields were high in most cases. Complexes 13 were characterized by X-ray diffraction. Interestingly,
complex 13 (R = Me, R1 = (−)-α-phenylethyl)
shows, in the solid state, a gold(I)–gold(I) distance of 3.223
Å that reflects unsupported strong aurophilic interactions. The
two C–Au–Cl units involved in the interaction show a
crossed arrangement with a C–Au–Au–C torsion
angle of 66.5°.

Scheme 7 Synthesis of Gold Sulfinyl 1,2,3-Triazolilydenes
The subsequent transformation of triazoles 12 into
sulfoximines 15 (route d in Scheme 5) was affected by the chemoselective oxidation
with m-CPBA to form the corresponding sulfonyl triazole 14 and subsequent imination22 with
PhI=NTs/Cu(OTf)2 to form the racemic sulfoximine 15 in an excellent yield (a in Scheme 8).23 Enantiopure
sulfoximines 15 were prepared avoiding the oxidation
step by the reaction of triazole sulfoxides 12 and PhI=NTs/Cu(OTf)2. Subsequent methylation yielded the enantiopure salts 16 (b in Scheme 8).24

Scheme 8 Synthesis of 1,2,3-Sulfonyl- and 1,2,3-Sulfoximidoyl-Substituted
Triazoles
An alternate route to 1,2,3-sulfoximidoyl-substituted
triazoles
was reported by Bolm using a Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between
organoazides and sulfoximidoyl alkynes 17 (Scheme 9).25 In these cases, the sulfoximidoyl alkynes were prepared by copper-catalyzed
imination of the corresponding sulfoxides with PhI=NTs. The
cycloaddition reaction was regioselective favoring the depicted product,
although variable amounts of the regioisomeric triazoles were formed.
Compounds 18 were not used in metal complexation. A related
procedure to prepare fully substituted 1,2,3-triazolyl-5-sulfoximines
by Cu(I)-catalyzed three component coupling of sulfoximines, alkynes,
and azides has been reported recently.26

Scheme 9 Bolm’s Synthesis of 1,2,3-Sulfoximidoyl-Substituted Triazoles
3 Catalysis
The metal
complexes derived from 1,2,3-MICs containing sulfoxide
or sufoximidoyl moieties have been used in different catalytic processes.
Thus complexes 3 (Scheme 4), 19, and 20 were good catalysts
for the Heck reaction (Scheme 10).18 Essentially, the reactions
of bromoaryl derivatives 21 and t-Bu-acrylate
gave the expected products with the above catalysts. Double adducts 22 were obtained when 2,6-dibromopiridine was used. What is
interesting is that both the coordinated cationic sulfide 20 and the uncoordinated sulfide 19 behave identically
to the uncoordinated sulfoxide catalyst 3, which indicates
that the sulfur-derived moiety is not participating in the catalytic
process (Scheme 10).

Scheme 10 Sulfur-Containing Palladium Benzimidazolilylidenes as Catalysts
in
the Heck Reaction
Complexes 9a–d were used as catalysts in the
acetoxylation reaction of toluene-promoted (diacetoxyiodo)benzene
as the oxidant in AcOH/H2O mixtures. The yields in acetoxylated
toluene derivatives ranged from acceptable to good (Scheme 11).19

Scheme 11 Sulfinyl Palladium-Imidazolilylidenes as Catalysts
Enantiomerically pure Au–MIC 13 were tested
in the cycloisomerization of 1,6-enynes 23. While these
complexes were very efficient in the formation of cyclic products 24 and 25, it soon became evident that sulfoxide
moieties were required for the cycloisomerization to occur. Thus,
Au–MICs 27 lacking the sulfur functional group
did not promote the cycloisomerization of enyne 23a,
while the analogous product 13a having the sulfoxide
moiety instead of the benzyl group formed exclusively the cyclized
product 24 in essentially quantitative yields. Moreover,
while the sulfoxide moiety is essential for the activity of the catalyst,
the bulkiness of the substituent at nitrogen determines the 5-exo
versus 6-endo ratio of cyclized products (Scheme 12). The bulkier the substituent at nitrogen,
the higher is the selectivity favoring the 5-exo cyclization product.
For example, catalyst 13b formed a 1:1.4 mixture of compounds 24 and 25 while the analogous reaction with catalyst 13a formed exclusively compound 24 in essentially
quantitative yields.

Scheme 12 Enantiopure Gold–MICs
as Catalysts in 1,6-Enyne Cycloisomerizations
The proposed catalytic cycle21 to explain
these observations involve an initial formation of gold carbene complexes A and B by reaction of the terminal alkyne and
the catalyst (internal alkynes do not react under these conditions).
This is the standard mechanism for Au-promoted carbocyclizations,27 and at this stage the sulfoxide moiety should
be a spectator. The 5-exo versus 6-endo cyclization selectivity should
be related to the bulkiness of the carbon linked to N1. Since intermediate C is much more crowded than D, the bulkier α-phenylethyl
moiety of complex 13a should favor the formation of A leading exclusively to the 5-exo product 24 (Scheme 12). On the other hand, the benzyl moiety
of complex 13b is less sterically demanding, leading
to mixtures of two regioisomers. This mechanistic hypothesis is congruent
with the results obtained and gives the apparent ancillary moiety
(the sulfoxide group) a key role unprecedented in the literature.
In fact, the lack of catalytic activity observed for 27 (Scheme 12) indicated
a clear involvement of the sulfoxide oxygen to stabilize Au–carbene
intermediates, very probably by the interaction of either the sulfur
lone pair or oxygen with carbene carbon or the gold center.28 This interaction stabilizes intermediates A and B and allows the reaction to proceed (Scheme 13).

Scheme 13 Mechanistic
Hypothesis for the Au-Catalyzed Carbocyclization of Enynes
Promoted by Catalysts 13
These results show that the sulfoxide group of the enantiopure
MICs 13 has a role in the catalytic cycles in contrast
with the results reported by other authors. In fact, no differences
in the catalytic activity were reported for isostructural catalysts
having a sulfide, a coordinated sulfide, or non-coordinated sulfoxide
functional groups.18

The catalytic
activity of Au–MICs 13 was also
tested in the cycloisomerization of enynes tethered to an aromatic
ring.29 The reaction of enynes 28 with catalyst 13a in the presence of NaBArF yielded
mixtures of compounds 29 and 30 differing
in the position of one double bond. These compounds are formed through
a cyclization dimerization cascade in excellent yields. The ratio 29:30 is temperature-dependent. Compounds 29 are the thermodynamic products and are formed at rt, while
compounds 30 are the kinetic products and are formed
at low temperatures. Compound 30 converts to the thermodynamic 29 on heating at rt in the presence of catalyst 13a. Again, the use of a simple Au-catalyst like Ph3PAuCl/AgSbF6 formed a different product, namely naphthalene 31 (Scheme 14). Clearly,
the role of the sulfoxide group in determining the nature of the reaction
products is decisive. In all cases the obtained products were racemic.
Therefore, albeit the sulfoxide group determines the effectiveness
of the reaction, it is not able to exercise any enantio-discrimination.
It should be noted that the use of stoichiometric amounts of NaBArF
in the cycloisomerization–dimerization cascade of enyne 28a formed quantitatively product 29. The mechanism
of these reactions should be markedly different from the Au-promoted
reactions.

Scheme 14 Catalyzed Cycloisomerization of Aromatic Enynes
The mechanism to explain these findings is depicted
in Scheme 15. The
initial reaction
of the diene system of 32 with Au(I)-catalysis should
form the cyclized intermediate 33 through transition
state 34. Deauration of 33 would yield 30 that may form the allylic isomerization product 29 depending on the reaction conditions. It should be noted (see below)
that the participation of the sulfoxide moiety in the stabilization
of intermediates 34 is decisive to determine the nature
and the yield of the final products (Scheme 15).

Scheme 15 Mechanistic Hypothesis for the Catalytic
Cyclization of Diene 32
The effect of the sulfoxide group on the MICs in determining the
efficiency and selectivity of the cyclization processes is also seen
in the reaction of enynes 28a,b, and benzaldehyde. In
fact, catalysts 13a in the presence of NaBArF formed
exclusively compounds 35 as single isomers in excellent
yields, while Ph3PAuCl yielded mixtures of diasteromers 35 and 36 in variable low yields (Scheme 16).

Scheme 16 Influence of the
Sulfoxide Group of the MICs in the Selectivity of
the Cycloisomerization of Aromatic Tethered Dienes
These differences in selectivity and reactivity were explained
by the formation of cationic species 37 through intermediate 38. This intermediate is trapped by the aldehyde to form Au-species 39 that yielded the final products 35a and 36a upon cationic cyclization and deauration. It is clear
that the role of the sulfinyl moiety in the stabilization of intermediate 37 is to produce the syn-isomer 35a. In the absence
of this stabilizing factor, both the yields and stereochemistry of
the reaction fall dramatically (Scheme 17). This hypothesis requires that the cyclization
of 28a and benzaldehyde through chair-like transition
state 39 has to be reversible.30 Thus, stabilization of the reactive intermediates by the sulfoxide
group accounts for the catalytic activity of MIC–Au catalysts 13 against dienes 28 and 32.

Scheme 17 Mechanistic Hypothesis for the Cyclization of Enyne 28a and Benzaldehyde
4 Chirality
Transfer in Organometallic Complexes
The possibility of affecting
the transfer of the chirality residing
in the sulfoxide chiral moiety of the MIC ligand to a metal center
is especially attractive. Methods to prepare chiral at metal half-sandwich
complexes have been extensively developed,31 including the sequence coordination of the metal to a chiral triazolinylidene
and imidazolinylidene carbenes and subsequent diastereoselective C–H
insertion,32 as well as the use of C2-chiral
NHCs33 and sugar-derived NHCs34 in analogous processes. By contrast, the use
of chiral sulfoxide ligands or reagents to achieve the synthesis of
chiral at the metal complexes has been scarcely studied.

Optically
active octahedral Ru-complexes were obtained by reaction
of cis- or trans-Ru(bpy)2Cl, with either (R)-(+)- or (S)-(−)-methyl p-tolyl sulfoxide.35 An analogous
procedure was used to prepare Ru–bis(diimine) sulfoxide complexes,36 and Ru–trispyridine
complexes.37 The preparation of achiral
half-sandwich complexes has been reported for Rh(III)-complexes having
an achiral sulfoxide bound to the metal within a naphthylindenyl moiety,
which confers planar chirality to the complex.38 Subsequently, these complexes were resolved and used to
prepare the corresponding chiral at the metal complexes by replacing
the chloride ligands by a phenylpyridine ligand (Scheme 18).39

Scheme 18 Sulfinyl Chiral at the Metal Half-Sandwich Rh(III) complex
MIC ligands containing chiral sulfoxide moieties
were used to develop
a general method to prepare chiral at the metal half-sandwich complexes
(M = Ir, Rh).24 Triazolium salts 41 were reacted with [MCl2Cp*]2 (M =
Ir, Rh) to form the corresponding dichloro derivatives 42 using Ag2O in the presence of NH4Cl and 4
Å molecular sieves. Treatment of complexes 42 with
NaOAc formed the corresponding cyclometalated chiral at metal complexes 43 in good yields and as single enantiomers (Scheme 19). It should be noted that
the sense of the asymmetric induction is independent on the bulkiness
of the sulfoxide substituent and on the nature of the metal. Moreover,
the use of sulfoximine salts 16 as the elements of asymmetry
in the starting MIC precursors also produces excellent levels of asymmetric
induction in the formation of complexes analogous to 43 while maintaining good chemical yields.

Scheme 19 Synthesis of Enantiopure
Chiral at the Metal Half-Sandwich Complexes
Enantiopure complexes 43 (M = Ir) can be transformed
into cationic complexes 44 by reaction with NaPF6 maintaining the configurational integrity of the metal center
(Scheme 20).

Scheme 20 Cationic
Enantiopure Chiral at the Metal Half-Sandwich Complexes
Additionally, the insertion of symmetrical alkynes
into the complexes 43 formed the corresponding alkyne-insertion
products 45 in excellent yields while maintaining the
integrity of
the configuration of the metal center. As expected, the insertion
of unsymmetrical alkynes (methyl propiolate) produced the mixture
of regioisomeric inserted alkynes 46a and 46b, with both regioisomers being enantiomerically pure compounds. The
configuration at the metal also remains unaltered in this case (Scheme 21).

Scheme 21 Insertion
of Alkynes Into Complexes 43
The formation of six-membered metallacycles by C–H activation
occurred with a considerable loss of stereoselectivity. Thus, complexes 47 proportionate the corresponding six-membered metallacycles 48 in an excellent chemical yield but with poor estereoselectivity
(3:2) (Scheme 22).
This is a consequence of the intermediacy of a seven-membered transition
state,40 which places the sulfoxide away
from the reactive center. The putative influence of the sulfoxide
in the stabilization of reaction intermediates looks clear.

Scheme 22 Synthesis
of Six-Membered Metallacycles
The stereochemistry of these reactions was determined by a combined
circular dichroism (CD)-X-ray study. Circular dichroism has been scarcely
used to establish the absolute configuration at the metal center of
half-sandwich metal carbene complexes.34,41 For example,
the CD spectra of complexes 43 show one main negative
absorption centered around 250 nm. X-ray analysis of complex 43 (R1 = H, R2 = Br) established an S absolute configuration at the Ir(III) chiral center. Therefore,
the negative Cotton effect around 250 nm was correlated to the S absolute configuration around the metal center. These
results were translated to cationic complexes 44 which
showed a negative Cotton effect also around 250 nm. This pointed to
a complete retention of the configuration at the metal center upon
the formation of the cationic complex by displacement of a chlorine
ligand by MeCN. This is due to the participation of the sulfoxide
moiety in the SN1-like mechanism leading to the cationic
complexes (Figure 2).42

Figure 2 CD-spectra of complexes 43–45.

The methodology CD-X-ray diffraction to determine the configurational
fate of the metal center during alkyne insertion was also effective.
Thus, metallacycle 45 has two weak negative absorptions
centered at 232.8 and 204.4 nm, and X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed
that the metal center retains its configuration. Again, the retention
of the configuration at the metal center can be traced to the participation
of the sulfoxide moiety during the dissociative process prior to the
coordination of the alkyne (Figure 2).43

Clearly, the
results above show the crucial participation of the
sulfoxide group in the chirality transfer processes, both during the
formation of the enantiopure metal center and during the transformation
of these enantiopure centers. The combination of CD-X-ray is a powerful
methodology to study these processes in the metal center.

5 Desulfinylation Reactions: Novel Reaction Pathways
1,2,3-Triazole
MICs having sulfoxide moieties are also interesting
substrates to study new processes. The lability of some groups attached
to the 1,2,3-triazole MICs has been observed by Albrecht.44 Thus, during the formation of Ru-complexes from
4-methoxycarbonyl-1,2,3-triazolium salts, partial decarboxylation
of the ester group in the precursor triazolium salt was detected,
which allowed for the preparation of C4-unsubstituted Ru-complexes.
Mechanistic studies were not pursued. Subsequent work by these authors45 resulted in a method to prepare C4-unsubstituted
Ru(II) and Au(I) complexes by decarboxylation of the corresponding
4-carboxy-MICs during the coordination process (Scheme 23).

Scheme 23 Decarboxylation
of a 1,2,3-Triazolium Salt during a Metalation Process
The preparation of silver complexes 49 having
two
C4-sulfoxide substituted 1,2,3-triazole MICs ligands occurred uneventfully
in excellent yields using the standard Ag2O/Me4NCl conditions for the metalation of the C5 position of the heterocyclic
ring. These complexes were isolated and characterized. However, when
complexes 49 were subjected to reaction with MeOH, removal
of the sulfinyl group was observed with the concomitant formation
of three new Ag(I) complexes 50, having the C4 position
unsubstituted.46 Regioisomeric Au(I) complexes 51/52 were obtained from the mixture of the Ag(I)
complexes (Scheme 24). X-ray diffraction of complexes 51d and 52d secured the regioisomeric nature of complexes 50. Additionally,
the reaction occurs with other primary and secondary but not tertiary
alcohols.

Scheme 24 Silver MIC Carbenes and Their Desulfinilation Reactions
To determine whether the desulfinilation occurred
in the silver
complexes 49 or in the free triazolium salts formed by
dissociation of these silver complexes, the free salt 53 was submitted to treatment with MeOH forming the unsubstituted triazolium
salt 54 together with methyl sulfinate (Scheme 25). The existence of equilibrium
between the Ag–MIC 49, the free carbene species,
and the corresponding Ag–monocarbenes was demonstrated by the
crystallization of silver monocarbene 56 from a solution
of 55. Moreover, the structure of this silver monocarbene
was resolved by X-ray diffraction.

Scheme 25 Desulfinylation
of Salt 53 and Formation of Ag(I)-Complex 56
The isolation of Ag–monocarbene 56 coupled
to the desulfinylation of 53 is coherent with the desulfinylation
reaction occurring through the free carbene A, analogous
to the one derived from 53 (Figure 3). Extensive deuteration experiments and
density functional theory (DFT) calculations allow the proposal of
a mechanism for this unprecedented desulfinylation reaction. MeOH
was modeled as one MeOH solvated by another two explicit MeOH molecules.47 The structure of TS-B is depicted
in Figure 3. In this
TS, the MeO– having two MeOH molecules experiences
the nucleophilic attack to the sulfur in a SN2 type reaction.
The participation of two molecules of MeOH proportionates the lower
energy TS computed for this rate determining step.

Figure 3 Computed reaction pathway
for the desulfinilation reaction in C4-sulfinyl-1,2,3-triazolium
salts. All values correspond to Gibbs energies in DCM (dichloromethane)
(kcal mol–1). DFT calculations were carried out
using the M06 density functional,48 with
an ultrafine grid as implemented in Gaussian 09.49 Gaussian 09 performs well for main-group chemistry and
noncovalent interactions.50 All intermediates
and transition states were fully optimized in DCM solution (ε
= 8.93) using the continuum method SMD.51 The 6-31G** basis set (BS1) was used. Final single-point
calculations were performed with the 6-311++G** basis set (BS2).52 Transition states were identified
by having one imaginary frequency in the Hessian matrix. It was confirmed
that transition states connect with the corresponding intermediates
by means of application of the eigenvector of the imaginary frequency
and subsequent optimization of the resulting structures.

The proposed reaction mechanism is shown in Figure 3 and entails three main steps:
(i) protonation
of the free carbene, (ii) desulfinylation via nucleophilic attack,
and (iii) carbene isomerization. First, the free carbene A (zero of energies) is protonated by methanol via TS-A (4.5 kcal mol–1) to form the triazolium cation B and [MeO–(MeOH)2]. The solvated
methoxide performs a nucleophilic attack on the sulfur center via TS-B (14.3 kcal mol–1), thus breaking the
S–C4 bond. Release of the sulfinate produces carbene C, which lacks substituents at the ring carbon atoms. Carbene C can then isomerize to E via the protonated
species D1 and D2 involving TS-C (4.1 kcal mol–1) and TS-D (1.9 kcal
mol–1). D1 and D2 are
computationally less favored than C and E due to entropic effects and poor stabilization of charged species
in the low polar DCM solvent. Overall, the largest activation energy
is 14.3 kcal mol–1 (from A to TS-B), which corresponds to the nucleophilic attack step.

This mechanism is consistent with the experimental data. The low
activation energy agrees with the mild experimental conditions, and
the rate-determining nucleophilic attack explains the slower reaction
rates observed with bulkier alcohols. In the presence of strong electrophiles
such as [Ag+] and [Au+], the carbenes C and E would readily react with Au(I) or Ag(I)
giving unsubstituted MIC-complexes. The exoergic desulfinylation from B to D2 (ΔΔG = −2.8
kcal mol–1) is also in line with the no participation
of Ag in the process. Moreover, the deuteration experiments carried
out for these processes show deuterium incorporation in the C3 and
C4 positions of the triazole ring, which is consistent with the facile
isomerization through proton transfer steps in the species D1 and D2.

6 Outlook
The results
presented above show the potential of MICs derived
from 1,2,3-triazoles having a chiral sulfur functional group at the
C5 position. While for some applications like anion recognition the
effect of the sulfur groups is to decrease the electronic density
of the triazole ring,23 the participation
of these groups in determining the nature and stereochemistry of the
final product is decisive. In catalytic cycloisomerization processes
and cycloisomerization–dimerization processes, the role of
the sulfoxide moiety is to stabilize intermediates in the catalytic
cycle, allowing for the reaction to occur or significantly increasing
the selectivity of the cyclization processes. Meanwhile, during chirality
transfer processes to the newly formed chiral metal center, the sulfur
functional group determines the chirality of this center which is
formed in a completely diastereoselective fashion. Moreover, the chiral
half-sandwich complexes containing the sulfur chiral group unaltered,
experience different reactions with complete retention of the configuration.
Finally, mechanistically new processes, like the desulfinilization
of 1,2,3-triazolium salts have been uncovered. Clearly, these classes
of compounds also offer new opportunities for the discovery and study
of new mechanistically relevant reactions. Overall, the sulfur chiral
moieties play a pivotal role in these processes. In addition, hypothetically
the reversible conversion of the S=O functional group into
its reduced and oxidized forms may be possible, which opens up substantial
opportunities both in catalysis and in the building of new structures.53

The reactions in Scheme 5 show that much remains to be done in this
field, including
the multinuclear systems, and the synthesis and application of the
regioisomeric 1,2,3-triazole MICs having the sulfur chiral group in
C4. The catalytic opportunities of these new chiral metal complexes
that include the chiral at the metal complexes have been just devised.
Again, these new catalysts offer opportunities for asymmetric synthesis
to be disclosed during the next few years. Finally, the disentangling
of the role of functional groups having more than one mode of coordination
to the metal opens up new opportunities for mechanistic studies (both
experimental and computational).
