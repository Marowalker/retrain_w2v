Dynamic mass redistribution (DMR)
and cellular dielectric spectroscopy
(CDS) are label-free biosensor technologies that capture real-time
integrated cellular responses upon exposure to extra- and intracellular
stimuli. They register signaling routes that are accompanied by cell
shape changes and/or molecular movement of cells proximal to the biosensor
to which they are attached. Here, we report the unexpected observation
that robust DMR and CDS signatures are also elicited upon direct stimulation
of G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels,
which are involved in the regulation of excitability in the heart
and brain. Using ML297, a small-molecule GIRK activator, along with
channel blockers and cytoskeletal network inhibitors, we found that
GIRK activation exerts its effects on cell shape by a mechanism which
depends on actin but not the microtubule network. Because label-free
real-time biosensing (i) quantitatively determines concentration dependency
of GIRK activators, (ii) accurately assesses the impact of GIRK channel
blockers, (iii) is high throughput-compatible, and (iv) visualizes
previously unknown cellular consequences downstream of direct GIRK
activation, we do not only provide a novel experimental strategy for
identification of GIRK ligands but also an entirely new angle to probe
GIRK (ligand) biology. We envision that DMR and CDS may add to the
repertoire of technologies for systematic exploitation of ion channel
function and, in turn, to the identification of novel GIRK ligands
in order to treat cardiovascular and neurological disorders.

Introduction
As G protein-gated
inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK, Kir3) channels
are implicated in an increasing number of pathologies, they are gaining
focus as targets for pharmacological intervention.1,2 They
exist as hetero- or homotetrameric structures comprised of one or
more of four subunits (GIRK1-4), depending on tissue distribution.3,4 GIRKs are activated by Gβγ subunits of stimulated Gi
protein-coupled receptors, thereby inducing neurons and cardiac pacemaker
cells to hyperpolarize and, as such, regulate cellular excitability
within heart and brain. GIRK channels have also been linked to pathologies
related to perturbations of rhythmic action potential firing, such
as epilepsy, cardiac arrhythmias, and Alzheimer’s disease among
others.1,3−6 In order to combat these diseases, unrelenting
search for new pharmacological treatment options has been underway.
The recent development of the small molecule GIRK activator ML297
is one such example that has shown positive effects in preclinical
models of epilepsy,7 anxiety,8 and Alzheimer’s disease.9 Yet, identification of new GIRK channel agonists with subtype
selectivity and tissue specificity is still an ongoing endeavor in
search for molecules with therapeutic potential.

Currently available
methods for the investigation of ion channels
and their ligands include automated electrophysiology and ion-specific
fluorescence dyes.10,11 The former requires electrical
access to the cell interior by either sealing a microelectrode onto
the cell surface with gigaohm resistance (classical patch clamp) or
dislodging the cells from their substrate in order to perform automated
measurements (automated patch clamp).10 The latter relies on dyes which are loaded onto and trapped within
cells, where they react sensitively to influx of specific ions or
changes in potential.11 Both techniques,
with patch clamping still considered as gold standard, are powerful,
yet technically challenging, time consuming, and only offer an insight
into a channel’s conducting function and upstream regulatory
elements.

Optical-based dynamic mass redistribution (DMR) and
cellular dielectric
spectroscopy (CDS) are label-free biosensor platforms. They are well
established for the detection of integrated responses in real-time
when living cells are exposed to pharmacologically active stimuli.12−28 Rather than relying on specific endpoints, such as changes in electrical
potentials or accumulation of ions, both biosensors deliver more complex
time-resolved activity profiles of entire cells, without the need
for physical access to cells or artificial labels (Figure 1a,b). In addition to their
original purpose of visualizing activity of signaling-competent proteins
within living cells, we here show that DMR and CDS also serve to monitor
the cellular consequences that occur upon direct GIRK channel activation.
We present the molecular underpinnings associated with GIRK-mediated
cell shape changes and raise the possibility that this mode of activation
may be mechanistically distinct from the endogenous Gαi-βγ
activation pathway. Thereby, our results do not only present a novel
method for detection of previously unrecognized GIRK-mediated downstream
effects but also have important implications for GIRK ligand drug
discovery.

Figure 1 Label-free readouts visualize ML297-induced responses in a GIRK1/2-specific
manner. (a) DMR assay: cells are located on top of a resonant waveguide
grating biosensor and exposed to polychromatic light at wavelengths
between 827 and 832.5 nm. The composition of the optical grating and
properties of the cells result in penetration of light ∼150
nm into the cells37−39 (area of detectable DMR). In this area, a specific
wavelength of light is reflected, whereas the rest is absorbed. If
addition of pharmacological stimuli leads to changes in cellular morphology,
the optical density within the “detection zone” is altered
leading to a change in the reflected wavelength [λ]. Compounds
that cause a decrease in mass proximal to the biosensor (yellow trace)
shift the reflected light to shorter wavelengths, whereas an increase
of mass (purple) results in a shift to longer wavelengths.13 (b) CDS assay: a monolayer of cells is cultivated
on top of an electrical biosensor. Alternating voltages at set frequencies
are applied through electrodes, which generate transcellular and extracellular
currents (dark blue arrows). Addition of biologically active compounds
influences the morphological structure of the monolayer. This change
might include spreading and migration of the cells to cover more of
the electrode’s surface area, or modifications in intercellular
connections, which in turn leads to an alteration of the well’s
impedance [Z].25−27,40,41 In the following, only the change in extracellular
impedance, measured at frequencies between 3320 and 24 700
Hz (factory default setting), is shown. (c,f) Exemplary DMR and impedance

Results and Discussion
GIRK Activation Elicits
Specific Label-Free Responses
Label-free methods are neither
widely used nor considered appropriate
to investigate ion channel behavior because the movement of ions per
se through the plasmalemma is not believed to register as mass movement.
On the other hand, evidence is available to suggest that selected
ion channels can directly influence cellular signaling mechanisms
through processes that are not directly linked to their ion flux function.29,30 We were intrigued to elicit robust label-free signatures upon stimulation
of GIRK1/2, the neuronal GIRK channel prototype, with ML297, a small
molecule GIRK activator selective for GIRK1-containing channels.8 Thus far, the GIRK subclass of inwardly rectifying
potassium channels has been linked to “conducting functions”
related to ion flow but not to “nonconducting functions”
related to cellular signaling mechanisms.1,4,7,8,31 Therefore, we set out to investigate the molecular
basis underlying GIRK channel activation-induced label-free whole
cell responses. In HEK cells recombinantly expressing the functional
GIRK1/2 subunit combination, we found that treatment with ML297 evoked
concentration-dependent DMR response profiles that were characterized
by an initial transient negative phase followed by a rapid ascending
phase (Figure 1c,d).
No changes in DMR were observed when native HEK cells were exposed
to ML297, confirming the GIRK-specific origin of mass movement. Control
stimulus carbachol (Cch) that acts via endogenous muscarinic M3 receptors
was equally effective in native and GIRK1/2 expressing cells, corroborating
that ML297 responses were no artifacts of altered cellular responsiveness
of GIRK-containing cells (Figure 1e). Similar results were obtained with CDS, another
label-free technique, which translates intracellular signaling events
into bioimpedance signals.15,16,18,25,26 Therein, activation of GIRK1/2 with ML297 led to characteristic
noninverting and concentration-dependent negative signals with similar
steady kinetics over 3600 s in a strictly GIRK-dependent manner (Figure 1f,g). Control stimulus
ATP was equally effective in both cell lines again confirming that
ML297 recordings were no consequence of generally enhanced responsiveness
in GIRK-expressing cells (Figure 1h). Notably, both methods revealed similar pEC50 values
(Table S1), 5.45 and 5.50 for DMR and CDS,
respectively, which is an order of magnitude lower than those observed
in patch clamp8 and thallium flux32 readouts. Together, these data show that direct
activation of GIRK channels is associated with a cellular event whose
persistent slow time scope differs considerably from what would be
expected from a channel that allows ions to flow rapidly through the
plasma membrane.

Label-Free GIRK1/2 Response Is Sensitive
to Inhibitors
To further corroborate that the label-free
records specifically originated
from GIRK1/2 channel activation, and to investigate whether mass movement
is functionally linked to ion flux, we pretreated GIRK1/2 expressing
cells with three distinct channel blockers: (i) the small molecule
SCH23390 (SCH), initially described as dopamine receptor agonist but
known to also block GIRK currents,33 (ii)
Tertiapin Q (TPNQ), the stable form of the bee toxin peptide, which
inhibits channel function via interaction with the base of the external
pore,34,35 and (iii) extracellular barium (Ba2+), which effectively blocks the channel pore.36 Incubation of cells with increasing concentrations of SCH
(Figure 2a,b) and TPNQ
(Figure 2c,d) dampened
the ML297 responses in a concentration-dependent manner without shifting
pEC50 values (Table S2), compatible with
noncompetitive antagonism. Ba2+ only partially blocked
the ML297-derived signal even at maximal concentration (Figure 2e,f), reminiscent of findings
previously reported in electrophysiological recordings.7 Inhibitor effects were specifically mediated
via GIRK1/2 channels because cell-intrinsic viability controls prostaglandin
E1 (PGE1) and ATP were unaltered in inhibitor pretreated cells (Figures 2g–i and S1). Equivalent findings were obtained when GIRK1/2
cells were pretreated with SCH and TPNQ using bioimpedance measurements
(Figure 3a–d).
These results show that both label-free platforms display specific
ML297-mediated cell responses that are impaired (Ba2+)
or absent (SCH and TPNQ) in the presence of GIRK blockers in striking
resemblance to results obtained with electrophysiological or ion-specific
fluorescence dye assays.8 We conclude that
label-free DMR and CDS portray the cellular consequences of GIRK channel
opening and thereby reveal an apparent molecular link between ion
flow and cell morphology changes, the molecular basis of DMR and CDS
detection.18,20,25,26 Indeed, images extracted from time-lapse
videos of living HEK GIRK1/2 cells revealed profound flattening of
cells in a strictly ML297-specific manner consistent with the movement
of mass towards the biosensor that was detected by DMR (Figure 4a,b). This motion was not observed
when cells were pretreated with SCH (Figure 4c) and was absent in cells lacking the GIRK1/2
channel (Figure S2, for full time-lapse videos see the Supporting Information).

Label-Free Readouts of
GIRK1/4 Heterotetramers Display Inhibitor-Sensitive
Responses to ML297
Patch clamp and thallium flux assays report
ML297 activity only if functional channel complexes bear the GIRK1
subunit.8,31 To interrogate whether the same molecular
requirements apply to label-free whole cell biosensing, we took advantage
of previously described functional and nonfunctional ML297-sensitive
and nonsensitive GIRK subunit combinations.8,31 We
obtained ML297-mediated and SCH-sensitive DMR recordings in HEK cells
stably expressing GIRK1/4, the prototypical isoform of the cardiovascular
system42 (Figure 5a). Cells expressing GIRK1 which contains
the ML297 binding site but does not form functional homomultimeric
channels (Figure 5b),
or GIRK2, which forms functional channels but lacks the relevant ML297
binding site3,4,8 (Figure 5c) failed to produce
any change in mass distribution readouts. Comparable results were
obtained in CDS recordings where ML297-dependent SCH-sensitive traces
were evoked only in GIRK1/4 but not in GIRK1 or GIRK2 expressing cells
(Figure 5d–f).
The observation that both readouts only detect ML297-mediated GIRK
activation upon its binding to functional GIRK1 bearing channels confirms
this molecular prerequisite to be shared for both label-free and electrophysiological
measurements.

Figure 5 Label-free readouts of GIRK1/4 heterotetramers display
inhibitor-sensitive
responses to ML297. Representative DMR (a–c) and impedance
(d–f) recordings of HEK cells stably transfected with the indicated
combination of GIRK1, GIRK2, and GIRK4 subunits incubated with buffer
or SCH as indicated prior to addition of ML297 and control compounds
(n = 3).

ML297-mediated and SCH-sensitive whole cell responses were
also
evoked in HL-1 cells, an immortalized murine cardiac cell line that
endogenously expresses GIRK1/4 channels.43,44 More specifically, we observed concentration-dependent DMR profiles
in response to ML297 reminiscent of those observed in the HEK background
(Figure 6a). ML297
(Figure 6b) but not
control stimuli (Figure 6c,d) were blunted by SCH pretreatment, suggesting GIRK-specific inhibition
of cellular responses. We also noted enhanced fluctuations within
DMR profiles in all SCH-pretreated samples (Figure 6b,d) which likely reflect the increase in
spontaneous beating because of endogenous GIRK1/4 inhibition by SCH.
From these experiments, we concluded that GIRK channel-mediated cell
morphology changes are not restricted to the HEK system but likely
are of more general relevance for cells that express GIRK under native
conditions.

or presence (b,d) of SCH.

Screening of Structural and Functional Analogs of ML297
If DMR and CDS biosensors faithfully recapitulate the cellular effects
triggered by direct GIRK activation, we reasoned that label-free activity
rankings of GIRK activators with different potencies should match
the profile obtained in thallium flux or patch clamp assays. To this
end, we characterized a small library of structural ML297 analogs,
all of which were previously characterized in thallium assays and/or
whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology in GIRK1/2-HEK cells7,32 (Table S3). Both DMR and CDS recordings
revealed specific responses to 551 which were sensitive
to inhibitor treatment and absent in native HEK cells (Figures 7 and S3). Although DMR also detected weak but significant activation by 553 (Figure 7a–c), this compound was inactive in CDS measurements across
all tested concentrations (Figure 7d–f). Efficacy of direct GIRK activators varied
somewhat between the two platforms (compare Figure 7c with 7f), yet pEC50
calculation portrayed 551 as more potent than ML297 and 553 for both methods, and, moreover, classified all remaining
analogs as inactive. Thus, overall potency rankings were retained
in label-free assays but concentration–effect curves for all
active GIRK ligands were again shifted to lower concentrations as
compared with thallium flux assays.

referred to by the last three digits of their Vanderbilt University
code. (b,e) AUCs from (a,d), respectively, and normalized to the indicated
concentration of ML297. (c,f) are concentration–response curves
derived for hit compounds using the DMR (c) or impedance (f) platform
(n = 3). pEC50 values for DMR and impedance were
determined as 5.07 ± 0.13; 5.22 ± 0.13 for ML297, 5.50 ±
0.16; 5.82 ± 0.16 for 551, and 5.06 ± 0.11;
(too low to determine) for 553.

From these results, we concluded (i) that DMR and CDS are
competent
to differentiate between true and false positives akin to methods
routinely applied for GIRK ligand characterization,8,11,31 and (ii) corroborate existence of a molecular
link between direct GIRK activation and cell morphology changes.

Gi-βγ Does Not Visibly Contribute to Direct ML297-Induced
GIRK Activation in DMR Detection
A mechanism alternative
to direct GIRK activation is used endogenously by excitable cells
and relies on Gβγ subunits that are released upon stimulation
of Gi-coupled G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Because it is known
from whole-cell and single-channel patch clamp experiments that GPCRs—via
Gβγ—and direct GIRK stimuli activate GIRK channels
in distinct manners,8 we wondered whether
DMR would recapitulate these mechanistic differences. One such difference
consists in the necessity of βγ itself, which is required
for GPCR—but not ML297-mediated GIRK activation.8 We used cell lines coexpressing the GIRK1/2 subunits
along with the Gi-sensitive OXE-receptor (OXE-R) and Gi/o inhibitor
pertussis toxin (PTX) to block liberation of Gβγ from
Gi-βγ heterotrimers. Indeed, ML297-mediated DMR responses
and thallium flux in PTX pretreated cells were likewise unaffected
or slightly diminished (Figure 8a,b). On the contrary, Gαi-βγ-dependent
thallium flux induced by 5-oxo-ETE stimulation of OXE-R was completely
blunted by PTX, and additionally by the specific OXE-R blocker Gore27,
confirming its receptor origin (Figure 8c). From these data, we concluded that ML297-mediated
DMR traces in GIRK expressing cells do not rely on Gαi-βγ
akin to ML297-mediated GIRK currents in thallium flux assays,8 again suggesting mechanistic commonalities between
direct ion flux assay techniques and the more distal DMR detection.
Because GIRK channels are pharmacological targets to reduce activity
of excitable cells in cardiological and neurological disorders, discovery
of ionotropic downstream consequences following their direct activation
should be of considerable relevance to GIRK channel drug development.

and (b,c) thallium flux showing HEK GIRK1/2 OXE-R cells stimulated

and absence of PTX (a), or PTX and Gore27 (b,c), presented as AUC
between 0–4800 (a) or 0–30 s (b,c), respectively (n = 3). Two-tailed student t-tests compared
the inhibitor-treated with the respective untreated values.

ML297-Induced DMR in GIRK1/2
Cells Requires an Intact Actin
Cytoskeleton
Changes registered with DMR or CDS biosensors
are a consequence of altered morphology and/or cell motion that occurs
when cells spread or “contract” on the surface of these
biosensors.20,25,45 To investigate the cellular origin that accounts for the observed
mass movements in response to ML297, we preincubated cells with actin
or tubulin polymerization inhibitors prior to DMR detection. Because
inhibition of actin- or tubulin-dependent cytoskeletal restructuring
may lead to cell detachment and register as loss of mass, this experiment
was recorded in suspension instead of the adherent mode and with sufficient
time to allow for baseline equilibration before ML297 addition (Figure S4a–c).

Actin inhibitors
cytochalasin B46 and latrunculin A,47,48 but not the microtubule inhibitor nocodazole49 attenuated ML297-mediated DMR responses in a concentration-dependent
manner (Figure 9a–c).
Importantly, inhibitor-treated cells remained viable during DMR detection
(Figure S4d) and responsive to external
stimuli that do not require an intact actin cytoskeleton such as Ca2+ release from intracellular stores50 (Figure S4e). From these results, we
concluded that the ML297 signal portrayed by DMR originated from changes
in actin network rearrangement downstream of ionotropic channel activity
rather than channel conductance in its own right. Thereby, holistic
DMR and CDS detection uncovered a previously unknown link between
direct GIRK activation and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.
We speculate that optical and impedance-based biosensing may become
more widely applied in the field of ion channel research for those
channels that elicit cellular effects beyond the simple conduction
of ions.

DMR changes. (a–c, left panels) Monitored wavelength shift

right panels) The summaries portray the AUC as mean + SEM normalized
to 100 μM Cch (n = 3). Two-tailed student t-tests compared the inhibitor treated with the respective
untreated values.

Conclusions
The
major finding of the present study is centered on the discovery
that optical and impedance-based biosensing of living cells sheds
light on molecular properties of GIRK channels and their ligands that
were previously not seen. Routinely, ion channel targeting drugs are
characterized using methods that record direct ion flow with patch
clamp being the gold standard because of its unrivalled precision
and accuracy.10 Our study advances the
field of ion channel drug discovery in an important way: we identified
label-free DMR and CDS as additional technology platforms competent
to portray GIRK channel activity beyond the mere conducting function.
Apparently, methods that record only ion flux per se provide an incomplete
picture of the spectrum of pharmacological activities of GIRK modulators.
Indeed, several channels are known to engage in channel–protein
interactions with cytoplasmic signaling molecules beyond the simple
transport of ions through the plasma membrane.19,30,51 These would be in need of additional methodologies
to portray their biological actions in a more comprehensive manner.
Slack (KNa1.1, KCNT1, SLO2.2), a sodium-activated K+ channel and member of the inward rectifying K+ channel family, is one such example.30 On the other hand, K+ channels such as BK (KCNMA1, SLO1)
and slick (KNa1.2, KCNT2, SLO2.1) do not produce DMR upon
direct stimulation, indicating that label-free whole cell responses
are no general consequence of increased K+ conductance.23 Because BK and slick—upon direct activation—do
not produce DMR, and slack triggers mass movement independent of ion
flux,30 GIRK channels stand out among voltage-sensitive
K+ channels in that they convert direct activation into
cell morphology changes, the basis of DMR and CDS detection.

One caveat deserves particular mention here: the majority of recordings
were obtained in HEK cells which express GIRK subunits recombinantly.
The striking correlation between DMR profiles (this study) and GIRK
electrophysiology8,31 in this very cellular background,
however, strongly suggests that a similar mechanism may operate in
primary cardiac or neuronal cells. Indeed, HEK cells haven proven
an ideal non-neuronal host for functional expression and electrophysiological
study of GIRK channels in the past.8,31 Therefore
our data do not only extend the repertoire of pharmacological assays
for characterization of GIRK channel-modifying drugs by label-free
noninvasive whole-cell biosensing but also identify GIRKs as a particular
subgroup within inwardly rectifying K+ channels that connect
ion flux to cytoskeleton-dependent cellular mechanisms. G protein-independent,
direct GIRK activation is still poorly understood. The effects observed
for ML297 in DMR and CDS may therefore be an important step to deepen
our understanding how other extrinsic and intrinsic factors like ethanol
or cholesterol, which also bypass G protein-gating,52−55 contribute to regulation of excitable
cells. The ability to capture previously unseen cellular mechanisms
surrounding GIRK activation in phenotypic live cell assays, therefore,
offers an unprecedented approach toward both identification of new
GIRK ligands and mechanistic understanding of their biological effects.
Given that DMR and CDS are high throughput-compatible, we anticipate
that both hold much promise in the preclinical discovery pipeline
for development of ion channel targeting drugs that regulate ion flux
and, additionally, are in need of technologies to portray their nonconducting
functions.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Reagents
Synthesis
of structural ML297
analogs was described previously.7,32 The analogs
are referred to by the last three digits of their Vanderbilt University
Code. For the full length code, see Figure 7a,d. The OXE-R antagonist Gore27 was prepared
following the synthetic route provided in ref (56) and detailed in the Supporting Information. The Thallos AM reagent
was purchased from TEFLabs (Austin, TX, USA), and PTX was from Life
Technologies (Darmstadt, GER). In all experiments, Hank’s balanced
salt solution from Thermo Fisher (Darmstadt, GER) supplemented with
20 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (pH 7.2) was used as assay buffer.

Stable Cell Lines
Generation of HEK293 (HEK) cell lines
stably expressing GIRK1/2 or GIRK2 were described previously.7 HEK cells stably expressing GIRK1/2 channels
and the Gi-sensitive 5-oxo-ETE receptor OXE-R were prepared from HEK
GIRK1/2 cells using selection with Geneticin/G418 followed by single
clone isolation. A stable monoclonal HEK GIRK1/4 expressing cell line
was generated from HEK GIRK1 cells upon transfection with a pcDNA3.1
plasmid coding for GIRK4 using selection with Geneticin/G418. The
cardiac muscle cell line HL-1 was purchased from Merck Millipore (Darmstadt,
GER).

Cell Culture
All cell lines were cultivated with 5%
CO2 at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere. All media
were supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS, penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin
(100 mg/mL). Native HEK cells were cultivated in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium, and HEK cells stably transfected with
GIRK subunits were cultivated in MEM Alpha Medium (1×) + GlutaMAX-I.
For cell lines expressing the GIRK1 subunit, Blasticidin (final concentration
of 5 μg/mL) was added to the media, Puromycin (3 μg/mL)
for GIRK2, and Geneticin/G418 (400 μg/mL) for GIRK4 and OXE-R,
respectively. HL-1 cells were cultivated in Claycomb medium supplemented
with FCS 10% (v/v), penicillin (100 U/mL), norepinephrin (0.1 mM),
and l-glutamine (2 mM).

Label-Free Real-Time Biosensor
Assays with Living Cells
DMR was recorded with the Corning
Epic biosensor as described previously.13 The Epic biosensor detects changes in the local
index of refraction upon stimulus-induced mass redistribution within
a cell monolayer that is grown in 384-well Epic microplates, which
contain a resonant wave guide grating biosensor at the bottom of each
well. Cells were seeded at a density of 15 000 cells/well 48
h before the experiment, with a media change every 24 h (HL-1) or
at 18 000 cells per well and cultivated overnight (HEK). DMR
assays in the presence of cytoskeletal inhibitor compounds (Figure 9) were recorded in
the suspension mode, using 20 000 cells per well that were
spun down gently at 800g to adhere to the sensor
surface.

Bioimpedance (CellKey) assays record the change in
extracellular impedance of a monolayer of cells located on top of
an electrical biosensor. The experiments were performed according
to the previously published protocol,57 with the following modifications: 15 000 cells per well were
seeded on PDL-coated 384-well biosensor plates for 18–24 h
to grow to confluence. For all assays, cells were preincubated with
assay buffer for 4 h prior to CDS measurements.

Time-Lapse
Microscopy
HEK cells lacking or stably expressing
GIRK1/2 were seeded in PDL-coated 12-well plates using 200 000
cells per well and cultivated in FCS-free medium overnight. Before
imaging, cells were equilibrated in assay buffer with or without SCH
for 1 h prior to ML297 or DMSO treatment. Time-lapse imaging was performed
using an inverted brightfield phase-contrast microscope (DM IRE 2,
Leica) [Leica DFC350 FX camera, N Plan L 20×/0.40 CORR LMC objective
(Leica)] equipped with a heated chamber (37 °C) and CO2 controller (5%) for 3 h after treatment. Pictures were taken every
3 min. Image processing was performed with ImageJ software.

Thallium
Flux Assay
Activation of GIRK channels was
measured using a Thallos AM dye-based thallium flux assay kit8 and recorded with the FlexStation 3 MultiMode
Bench Top reader. The results show channel opening as increase in
fluorescence over time. For the exact procedure, see the Supporting Information.

Calcium Flux Assay
Intracellular Ca2+ mobilization
was measured using the calcium 5 assay kit (molecular devices) as
previously described.58

Cell Viability
Assay
Viability of HEK cell lines was
assessed using the CellTiter-Blue assay from Promega following the
manufacturer’s instructions. See the Supporting Information for more details.

Data Analysis and Statistics
All real-time recordings
show one representative biological replicate as mean + SEM of three
technical replicates generated in parallel recordings. For quantification
of DMR and CDS traces, at least three independent biological replicates
were used, each consisting of three technical replicates. Concentration–effect
curves were fitted using GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software Inc.,
San Diego, CA, USA) showing means ± SEM and are based on the
number of biological replicates indicated in the figure legends. P
values were determined, and P < 0.05 was considered
significant (*), P < 0.01 very significant (**),
and P < 0.001 extremely significant (***).
