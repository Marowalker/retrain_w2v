Oleate ion was intercalated into a hydrotalcite obtained
using
a conventional precipitation method and an alternative, novel method
involving microwave-assisted ion exchange. The latter method gave
a more crystalline hydrotalcite with better textural properties than
the former. The spacing between layers in the hydrotalcites was used
to epoxidize the double bond in oleate ion. X-ray diffraction patterns
revealed that the layered structure of the hydrotalcites was not altered
by the reaction. The epoxidation of oleate ion with m-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA) was monitored using
Raman spectroscopy. The results of this work testify to the high potential
of hydrotalcites as molecular reactors for reactions in confined spaces.

==== Body
Introduction
Hydrotalcite-like compounds (HTlCs) are
a family of naturally occurring
substances also known as “anionic clays”, “layered
double hydroxides” (LDH), or, simply, “hydrotalcites”
(HTs), of general formula [M(II)1–xM(III)x(OH)2]x+[Ax/n]n−·mH2O, where A is an anion countering positive charge and x (usually 0.20–0.36) is the fraction of trivalent
metal replacing the divalent metal in the layers.1−3 All HTs are
assumed to be derived from the natural mineral called “hydrotalcite”,
Mg6Al2CO3(OH)16·4H2O, which is structurally similar to brucite [Mg(OH)2]. In fact, brucite has a layered structure consisting of an infinite
number of Mg(OH)6 octahedra, the layers being joined by
hydrogen bonds to form stacks. In hydrotalcites, a number of Mg2+ ions are replaced by a trivalent metal, which causes a charge
deficiency in the layers that is offset by anions occupying the interlayer
spacing together with water molecules. However, Mg2+ can
also be replaced with another divalent metal to form a variety of
compounds (the HT family). The sole condition to be met by the divalent
or trivalent metal is that its ionic radius should be similar to that
of magnesium.2 Electrostatic interactions
between interlayer anions and trivalent cations allow the three-dimensional
structure of hydrotalcite to be preserved.2

The anion in HTs can range wide in nature and even be an organic
one.4 Organic ions possessing a long enough
hydrocarbon chain can result in considerable hydrophobic interactions.5−7 Also, the intercalated anion causes the formation of various supramolecular
structures in hydrotalcites; in fact, intercalation of long-chain
molecules can cause the interlayer region in HTs to self-assemble
into mono- or bilayers.7 Hybrid (organic–inorganic)
nanocomposites can be obtained using the typical methods for the direct
synthesis of HTs, that is, coprecipitation of salts of divalent and
trivalent metals in the presence of the organic anion to be intercalated.8−11 The are other equally effective methods based on ion exchange or
rebuilding the hydrotalcite from mixed oxides prepared by calcining
an HT precursor.

These hybrid materials have found interesting
uses based on the
ability of hydrophobized HTs to readily adsorb organic compounds12−15 and metals14,16 (especially, environmentally
significant substances). Also, the special properties of these nanocomposites
allow their use as polymer additives, magnetic materials, and catalysts
(or catalyst precursors).17 The long-chain
organic anions used as intercalates for HTs include oleate, an alkenylcarboxylate
ion5,18,19 that has been
used to obtain organic polymer nanocomposites for use as flame retardants20,21 and also in typical applications of organo-HTs such as rheology
controlling reagents, environmental purification sorbents, pillared
clay precursors, and catalysts or catalyst supports.

Organo-HTs
are typically obtained by coprecipitation. This method
provides aggregates consisting of nanocrystals containing hundreds
or thousands of HT-like layers.22,23 The last two decades
have seen increasing efforts at preparing HTs consisting of particles
of a small, uniform size in addition to a high specific surface area.
One of the most successful methods for synthesizing HTs in the absence
of organic ions uses microwave irradiation.24−29 Although Komarneni et al.30 reported
the first synthesis of an organo-HT with this method more than two
decades ago, relatively few organo-hybrid materials have been produced
in this way since then.31−36

The ability of hydrotalcites to host molecular reactions in
the
spacing between their layers is also underexploited. The restricted
geometry of organic molecules can lead to specific stereochemical
outcomes or alter reaction rates and product distributions. Epoxidation
has been widely used to obtain products of industrial interest and
synthesize pharmaceutical and fine chemistry intermediates and end-products.
The epoxidation of fatty acids gives epoxides for use in the polymer
industry.37 The process, based on the Prilezhaev
reaction, uses a peroxide for oxygen transfer to a double bond in
the fatty acid. The reaction mechanism is well known and occurs in
a concerted manner, which allows the stereochemistry of the starting
reactant to be preserved.

This paper reports the first synthesis
of an oleate/Mg,Al-HT prepared
by microwave-assisted ion exchange in an LDH-containing nitrate as
an interlayer anion. The hydrotalcite acts as a host and oleate ion
as a guest (interlayer anion). An alternative method, the conventional
method, in fact, was used to prepare an oleate/Mg,Al-HT by ion exchange
with heating in a thermostatic poly(ethylene glycol) bath. The aim
was to obtain two organo-HTs differing in crystallinity to study the
epoxidation of the olefinic double bond in oleate ion with a view
to assessing the potential use of the resulting organo-HTs and their
efficiency as nanoreactors.

Results and Discussion
Metal Ratio
All HTs were subjected to elemental analysis.
As can be seen from Table 1, their Mg/Al metal ratio was close to that in the starting
solution. The only, slight differences were those between solids obtained
with or without microwave irradiation and those between HTs containing
a different intercalated anion.34

X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Patterns
Figure 1 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD)
for the nitrate- (HT-NO3-COP) and oleate-containing HTs
(HT-OLE-EXC and HT-OLE-MW-2). As can be seen from Figure 1a, the pattern for HT-NO3-COP was typical of a hydrotalcite, with narrow, sharp, strong
peaks at low 2θ values but weaker, less symmetric peaks at high
2θ values. These patterns are consistent with those previously
reported for HTs by other authors2 and
our own group.38

Figure 1 XRD patterns for the
LDHs: (a) HT-NO3COP, (b) HT-OLE-EXC,
and (c) HT-OLE-MW-2.

X-ray diffraction analysis allows one to distinguish
between baseline
reflections (00l), which are typically high, sharp
bands at low 2θ values, from other reflections. Baseline reflections
correspond to successive orders in the baseline spacing c′ (viz., the distance between two brucite-like layers as measured
from the center of the layer, or, in other words, the interlayer spacing
plus the thickness of one layer). The first of the two weak reflections
observed above 60° was indexed as (110). This reflection is independent
of the type of packing, so it can be used to calculate parameter a from a = 2d(110). a is a measure of the distance between two neighboring
cations in a brucite-like layer. Table 1 shows the calculated values of a and
also of the lattice parameter c [c = 3/2(d(003) + 2d(006))], which is three times c′. Obviously, c depends on the particular intercalated anion and its orientation,
and also on the strength of electrostatic interactions between the
anion and brucite-like layers. The c value for nitrate-containing
hydrotalcite is similar to those for solids with a similar metal ratio
and nitrate as an interlayer anion.2,39

Figure 1b,c shows
the XRD patterns of the oleate-intercalated solids obtained by ion
exchange in HT-NO3-COP. As can be seen, the patterns exhibited
the same reflections but differed in strength. Thus, the peaks for
the solid obtained with microwave irradiation for 2 h (HT-OLE-MW-2)
were much stronger than those for the thermally prepared solid (HT-OLE-EXC).
Also, the solids differed slightly in their 2θ values, and hence
in c and a. The presence of oleate
ion intercalated in the interlayer region of both HTs was confirmed
by an expanded baseline spacing (3.379 and 3.368 nm for the oleate-containing
solids vs only 0.877 nm for the nitrate-intercalated solid; Table 1). A spacing of ca.
3.4 nm is consistent with partial overlap of oleate chains (see Figure 2) as previously observed
by Xu et al.5 The oleate-containing solids
exhibited a broad halo at about 20° that was assigned to sodium
oleate molecules possibly forming micelles in the composite samples.
The halo was much more marked in the least-crystalline solid.

Figure 2 Packing of
oleate chains in the HT interlayer region.

Once microwave irradiation was found to provide
the most crystalline
solid, the influence of the treatment on the structure of the resulting
hydrotalcite was examined. Figure 3 shows the XRD patterns for the solids obtained by
irradiation for 1, 2, and 3 h. The resulting HTs were quite crystalline.
The strength of the (00l) reflections, and hence
crystallinity, increased upon increasing the length of the treatment
from 1 to 2 h; however, such a strength decreased upon further expanding
the treatment to 3 h. Parameter c was smallest for
the solid irradiated for 2 h, possibly as a result of the loss of
interlayer water.32 Increasing the treatment
time to 3 h increased the interlayer spacing, thereby decreasing the
strength and increasing the width of baseline reflections. As previously
suggested by Herrero et al.32 for other
organo-HTs, the increased spacing was possibly due to the HT structure
starting to collapse.

irradiation
for (a) 1 h (HT-OLE-MW-1), (b) 2 h (HT-OLE-MW-2), and (c) 3 h (HT-OLE-MW-3).

After epoxidation reaction, XRD patterns of hydrotalcites
did not
show any structural changes, just a slight decrease of crystallinity
(Figure S1).

Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy allows the interlayer
anion in a hydrotalcite to be identified40,41 and the nature of its hydroxyl groups to be elucidated.41,42 In this work, we used this technique not only to confirm that, as
previously revealed by the XRD patterns, the anion had been successfully
intercalated but also to check that nitrate had been thoroughly removed
from the interlayer region.

The bands for O–H bond stretching
in a Raman spectrum typically appear in the region from 2800 to 3700
cm–1. In this region, a hydrotalcite should exhibit
the bands for O–H bonds of water molecules in the interlayer
spacing and brucite-like structural units. However, water is a very
poor Raman scatterer, so Raman spectroscopy is of limited use here
except for studying O–H groups bound to metals in brucite-like
units.42,43Figure 4 shows the Raman spectra in the 2500–3800 cm–1 region for the target hydrotalcites. The bands for
HT-NO3-COP (Figure 4a) were exclusively due to hydroxyl groups, the two strong
bands at 3610 and 3502 cm–1 corresponding to O–H
bond stretching in hydroxyl groups of brucite-like layers in Mg3OH and Mg2OH structural units, respectively. Deconvoluting
the band at 3502 cm–1 (results not shown) revealed
that it comprised two additional components at 3326 and 3115 cm–1. Similarly, to the IR spectra for hydrotalcites [8],
the band at 3100 cm–1 can be assigned to the O–H
bond stretching in hydroxyl groups connected to the interlayer nitrate
anions through hydrogen bonds. This signal has also been assigned
to OH bonds in water molecules acting as both donors and acceptors
of hydrogen bonds between M3OH and carbonate ions,43 or nitrate ions in our case. The band at ca.
3300 cm–1 can be assigned to OH groups of water
molecules in the interlayer region.

Figure 4 Raman spectra in the 2500–3800
cm–1 region
for the hydrotalcites HT-NO3-COP (a), HT-OLE-EXC (b), and
HT-OLE-MW-2 (c).

As can be seen from Figure 4b,c, the Raman spectra for the hydrotalcites
containing intercalated
oleate were virtually identical; however, only that treated for 2
h among those obtained by microwave irradiation was studied. The first
salient feature of the spectra was the virtually complete absence
of bands for O–H bonds by effect of an increased hydrophobicity
in the interlayer region considerably reducing the presence of water
molecules. One other salient feature was the very strong bands for
C–H bond stretching, which reduced the relative strength of
those for O–H bond stretching. The presence of oleate in the
solids was confirmed by bands at 3011 and below 3000 cm–1, characteristics to =C–H and C–H stretching vibration
modes, respectively. It is further confirmed by the presence of typical
Raman bands associated with the oleate molecules in the range 200–2000
cm–1 (Figure 5). The spectrum for HT-NO3-COP exhibited a sharp,
strong band at 1056 cm–1, which was assigned to
stretching of N–O bonds in interlayer nitrate ions. This band
was accompanied by other, smaller ones, the most salient of which
fell at 555 and 717 cm–1. The former, together with
a very small one at ca. 470 cm–1, was assigned to
the symmetric stretching of Al–OH bonds (the A1g and Eg vibration mode, respectively44). On the other hand, the band at 717 cm–1 was assigned to vibrations of Mg–O bonds.45 In this spectral region, oleate-containing HTs show bands
for C–C, C=C, and C=O bond stretchings and also
for deformation of these and C–H bonds. For comparison, Figure 5 also shows the Raman
spectrum for pure sodium oleate, which exhibits all the bands seen
in the spectra for the oleate-containing HTs except those at 555 and
717 cm–1, due to M–O bonds in brucite-like
layers. Also worth noting is the absence of the stretching band at
1056 cm–1 present in the spectra for the two oleate-containing
HTs, which clearly shows that ion exchange occurred to an optimum
extent in both cases.

Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) Results
TGA analyses
were performed to determine the amount of oleate and epoxidized products
in the hydrotalcites. TGA curves were similar to those reported in
literature for other HTs with oleate anions in their interlaminar
region.20 They showed three main weight
losses (Figure 6).
The first, below 220 °C, was related to the loss of water adsorbed
into interparticle pores. The second in the range 220–550 °C
would correspond to the decomposition of HT into mixed-oxide MgAlOx along with the loss of all organic matter. Finally, a third
loss above 500 °C might be assigned to the transformation of
the previous oxides into a spinel (MgAl2O4). Table 2 collects the results
obtained from thermogravimetric analysis for HT-OLE-EXC and HT-OLE-MW-2
and the epoxidized product of this latter, HT-OLE-MW-2-EPO. HT-OLE-MW-2
showed a slight increase of oleate amount (around of 4–5%)
in comparison to that synthesized by the ion-exchange method.

Epoxidation of Intercalated Oleate
The epoxidation
of oleate intercalated in the hydrotalcites produced 9,10-epoxyhexadecanoate
ion. As noted in the Introduction section, the reaction with m-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA) occurs
in a concerted manner and the resulting epoxide retains the starting
stereochemistry. mCPBA enables rapid reaction under
mild temperature conditions and produces no olefin derivatives. Also,
it is a readily handled reagent whose only disadvantage is that it
leads to the formation of a byproduct (m-chlorobenzoic
acid), which must be removed after the reaction has completed.

The epoxidation reaction was monitored by recording periodic Raman
spectra. As can be seen in Figure 7, which shows the spectral region from 2800 to 3200
cm–1, intercalated oleate ion exhibited a band at
3011 cm–1 due to stretching of olefin =C–H
bonds that was absent from the spectrum for mCPBA,
whose aromatic =C–H stretching band appeared at 3079 cm–1. Since epoxidation caused the olefinic double bond
in oleate ion to break, the associated band was used to monitor the
reaction. By way of example, Figure 8a illustrates the results for the epoxidation of HT-OLE-MW-2,
and Figure 8b shows
the temporal variation of the conversion of interlayer oleate ion
into the corresponding epoxide. As can be seen, conversion was somewhat
faster in HT-OLE-EXC than that in HT-OLE-MW-2; in any case, both reactions
completed within 10 min. Based on these results, the marked differences
in crystallinity between the two hydrotalcites scarcely influenced
the epoxidation of the interlayer anion.

Hydrotalcites therefore provide an effective method
for epoxidizing
alkenes in confined spaces. This, together with the high reactivity
of the oxirane ring, opens up highly promising avenues for synthetizing
compounds of great interest through hydrotalcite intercalates that
would otherwise be very difficult to prepare.

Conclusions
In this work, oleate ion was intercalated
in the interlayer region
of hydrotalcite using two different synthetic methods. Microwave-assisted
ion exchange provided a more crystalline solid than conventional coprecipitation.
The former method shortened the synthesis time from 24 to only 2 h.
Once intercalated, oleate ion was epoxidized in the confined space
of the interlayer region of the hydrotalcites. Raman spectra provided
very useful information about the reaction development. Irrespective
of synthetic method, intercalated oleate was thoroughly epoxidized
within minutes. The results of this work confirm not only the ability
of hydrotalcites as nanoreactors but also that of using epoxidized
oleate as a reactant to obtain more complex compounds that are difficult
to prepare with the classical method (viz., direct intercalation of
anions into a hydrotalcite).

Experimental Section
Hydrotalcite containing nitrate
as an interlayer anion was prepared
by coprecipitation as described elsewhere.8 Two solutions containing 0.25 mol of MgNO3·6H2O and 0.1 mol of AlNO3·9H2O [Mg/Al
= 2.5] in 25 mL of deionized water were used for this purpose. The
mixture was slowly dropped over 75 mL of a carbonate solution at pH
10 at 60 °C under vigorous stirring, the pH being kept constant
by adding appropriate volumes of 1 M NaOH during precipitation. The
suspension thus obtained was allowed to stand at 80 °C for 24
h, after which the solid was filtered off and washed with 2 L of deionized
water. The product thus obtained was named HT-NO3-COP.

The ion-exchange method used to obtain hydrotalcite with oleate
as an intercalated anion was similar to that previously developed
by our group to obtain other organo-HTs.46 An amount of 1 g of solid HT-NO3-COP was suspended in
50 mL of a solution containing 0.45 g of sodium oleate in bidistilled,
decarbonated water in a nitrogen atmosphere at 100 °C under continuous
stirring for 24 h. Then, the solid was isolated by centrifugation
and called HT-OLE-EXC.

Finally, the oleate-containing HT was
prepared by microwave-assisted
ion exchange. For this purpose, appropriate amounts of sodium oleate
(0.20 g) and HT-NO3-COP (0.50 g) were added to 20 mL of
deionized water, the suspension being transferred to a 100 mL Teflon
autoclave vessel and heated at 90 °C in an MA186-001 flexiWAVE
microwave oven from Milestone Srl (Sorisole, Italy), using a power
of 300 W for 1, 2, or 3 h. The resulting solids were recovered by
decantation, washed with deionized water, and named HT-OLE-MW-X, where X is the irradiation time in hours
(1, 2, or 3).

All LDHs were analyzed by X-ray diffraction to
check that they
possessed an HT structure, and also by Raman spectroscopy. The Mg/Al
ratio of the solids was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometry (ICP-MS) on an ELAN DRC-E Perkin Elmer ICP-MS instrument
operated under standard conditions. X-ray diffraction patterns were
obtained on a Siemens D-5000 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation.
Patterns were recorded over the 2θ range from 1 to 70°.
The Raman spectra for the solids were acquired with a Renishaw Raman
instrument (InVia Raman Microscope) equipped with a Leica microscope
furnished with various lenses, monochromators, and filters, in addition
to a CCD. Spectra were obtained by excitation with a red laser light
(750 nm) over the wavenumber range 2500–4000 cm–1 and green laser light (532 nm) from 100 to 2000 cm–1. These two lasers provided spectra of increased quality in all windows
examined. A total of 32 scans per spectrum were done to improve the
signal-to-noise ratio. All spectral treatments (baseline correction,
smoothing, normalization, and deconvolution) were done with software
Peakfit v. 4.11.

The epoxidation reaction was conducted by suspending
0.25 g of
HT in 5 mL of chloroform. The suspension, under continuous stirring,
was supplied with a solution of 82,86 mmol/L of m-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA) in chloroform dropwise
for 30 min with periodic sampling of the medium. The HT suspension
was then isolated by filtration and washed several times with methanol
to remove any residual mCPBA. The rate of the epoxidation
reaction was examined by monitoring the Raman signals for C=C–H
bonds in oleate ion. To this end, samples taken at regular intervals
from the reaction medium were evaporated to a solid residue containing
a hydrotalcite and residual mCPBA.
