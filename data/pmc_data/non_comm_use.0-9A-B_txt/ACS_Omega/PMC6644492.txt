An
assessment is undertaken for the formation of anorthite crystalline
phase in a melilite-based glass composition (CMAS: 38.7CaO–9.7MgO–12.9Al2O3–38.7SiO2 mol %), used as a
sealing material in solid oxide fuel cells, in view of the detrimental
effect of anorthite on the sealing properties. Several advanced characterization
techniques are employed to assess the material after prolonged heat
treatment, including neutron powder diffraction (ND), X-ray powder
diffraction (XRD), 29Si and 27Al magic-angle
spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR), and in situ Raman spectroscopy.
ND, 29Si MAS-NMR, and 27Al MAS-NMR results revealed
that both Si and Al adopt tetrahedral coordination and participate
in the formation of the network structure. In situ XRD measurements
for the CMAS glass demonstrate the thermal stability of the glass
structure up to 850 °C. Further heat treatment up to 900 °C
initiates the precipitation of melilite, a solid solution of akermanite/gehlenite
crystalline phase. Qualitative XRD data for glass-ceramics (GCs) produced
after heat treatment at 850 °C for 500 h revealed the presence
of anorthite along with the melilite crystalline phase. Rietveld refinement
of XRD data indicated a high fraction of glassy phase (∼67%)
after the formation of crystalline phases. The 29Si MAS-NMR
spectra for the CMAS-GC suggest the presence of structural units in
the remaining glassy phase with a polymerization degree higher than
dimer units, whereas the 27Al MAS-NMR spectra revealed
that most Al3+ cations exhibit a 4-fold coordination. In
situ Raman spectroscopy data indicate that the formation of anorthite
crystalline phase initiated after 240 h of heat treatment at 850 °C
owing to the interaction between the gehlenite crystals and the remaining
glassy phase.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In
recent years, planar-solid oxide fuel cells (p-SOFC) have been
considered as one of the most efficient and versatile power generation
systems. However, a major hurdle that needs to be overcome for their
commercialization is the development of a hermetic high-temperature
sealing material.1−4 Durable sealants are required to prevent gas mixing between the
anode and cathode compartments, to bond the cell stacks, and to provide
electrical insulation. Among the various types of sealing materials,
glasses and glass-ceramics (GCs) are considered to be the most efficient
and attractive sealants for SOFCs because of their ability to form
hermetic and durable seals at high temperatures and at relatively
low cost.3−6

Glass-based materials are promising for many technological
applications
because of their flexible chemical compositions combined with ease
of handling and manufacturing and relative cheapness.4,7 Glasses are known to be more stable at room temperature (RT) because
of the short-range order of the bonding ions.8 Although the stability of vitreous phase usually decreases with
increasing temperature or during isothermal heat treatments,3 the thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties
of the heat-treated materials may be improved through the formation
of crystalline phases, forming GCs. The chemical formulae of the formed
crystalline phases are closely related to that of the parent glass
composition. In general, GCs are polycrystalline materials, normally
obtained from parent glasses by partial devitrification.9 However, the polymorphism of the crystalline
phase is another important feature that can affect the properties
of GCs. For example, barium-rich, aluminosilicate-based glasses are
known to exhibit appropriate coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs)
for their operation as sealing materials in SOFCs.10 However, these glasses have a tendency to devitrify at
around 800–850 °C, resulting in the appearance of hexacelsian
(BaAl2Si2O8). During SOFC operation,
the crystalline phase gradually transforms into its monoclinic polymorph,
which has a low CTE11 associated with the
deterioration of the mechanical properties. Hence, understanding the
formation and development of crystalline phases in GC-based materials
during devitrification is of crucial importance for industrial applications.

In search of a suitable glass sealant material for p-SOFCs, with
high chemical resistance and appropriate CTE, we have investigated
a glass composition in the CaO–MgO–Al2O3–SiO2 (CMAS) system and within the primary
crystallization field of akermanite (Ca2MgSi2O7)/gehlenite (Ca2Al2SiO7).12 Nevertheless, the formation of triclinic
anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8), an important
member of the feldspar family, as the second dominant crystalline
phase after 300 h of heat treatment at 850 °C, puts into question
the reliability of CMAS as a glass seal. The most important aspects
of anorthite in relation to sealant applications are the temperature-induced
reversible phase transformation and its CTE value. Anorthite adopts
triclinic symmetry (space group P1̅) at RT
but transforms to the body-centered I1̅ space
group at a transition temperature (Tc)
of approximately 240 °C.13−15 The framework structure is more
crumpled in the P1̅ symmetry and more expanded
in the I1̅ phase.16 Moreover, the apparent CTE value of anorthite was reported to be
11 × 10–6 K–1 within the
temperature range 20–1000 °C.17 This contrasts with the value of ∼5.3 × 10–6 K–1 determined within the temperature range of
250–800 °C from high-resolution data of the I1̅ phase.18−20 Hence, the CMAS glass may not be completely satisfactory
in real SOFC operating conditions under repeated thermal cycling,
under which even a minor mismatch in the CTE gives rise to thermal
stresses in the GC sealant during startup and shutdown.5,6 Although the induced stresses may not cause an immediate seal failure,
they may generate cracks during long-term operation. The formation
of undesired crystalline phases in the technologically applicable
GC materials therefore should be avoided.

In view of the above,
we endeavor to better understand the formation
of undesired secondary crystalline phase in CMAS-GC-based sealant
materials. In the present study, a range of structurally sensitive
investigation tools are employed to this end, including neutron powder
diffraction (ND), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), 29Si
and 27Al magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance
(MAS-NMR), and in situ Raman spectroscopy.

2 Results
2.1 Glass Structure
Figure 1 shows the total experimental
structure factor S(Q) (dotted line)
and simulated S(Q) from the reverse
Monte Carlo (RMC) model (continuous line) for the CMAS glass composition
derived from neutron diffraction for Q values in
the range 0.95–9.5 Å–1. It is known
that the ND technique is highly sensitive to hydrogen, the presence
of which in glass samples due to hydrolysis results in well-identified
peaks in the final ND spectrum. Here, the ND pattern reveals that
the specimens are fully amorphous, and no hydrogen was detected. The
most striking feature of the S(Q) data is the relatively high intensity and sharp distribution of
the first and second peaks of the CMAS glass, which is a fingerprint
of a network structure formed by well-defined units. The intensity
of the third and fourth peaks of the glass becomes broader, indicating
a complex network structure.

Figure 1 Neutron diffraction structure factors of CMAS
glass: experimental
data (dots) and RMC simulation (solid black line).

Several partial atomic pair correlation functions
and coordination
number distributions have been revealed with moderately good stability.
Herein, we focus on the characteristic features of oxygen coordination
of the Si and Al network formers by analyzing the polyhedral units
and their linkages. The derived atomic pair correlation functions gij(r) and
the coordination number distributions from the RMC simulations for
the CMAS glass composition are shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.
In general, the position and width of the peak in the pair correlation
function gij(r) reflect the value and the distribution of the distances
for different atomic correlations, respectively. The oxygen-linked gi–O(r) (where i = Ca,
Mg, Al, Si, and O) are shown in the plots of Figure 2. The peaks for Si–O, Al–O,
Mg–O, and Ca–O pairs are located at 1.6, 1.75, 1.7,
and 2.35 Å, respectively. These values concur with the characteristic
lengths of 1.6 Å for Si–O and 1.75 Å for Al–O
for multicomponent aluminosilicate glasses.21

from the RMC modeling for the CMAS glass: (a) Ca–O, (b) Mg–O,
(c) Al–O, (d) Si–O, and (e) O–O.

Figure 3 Coordination number distributions, CNij, as obtained from the RMC modeling for the CMAS glass.

The peak corresponding to Si–O
correlations is narrow, whereas
those corresponding to Al–O, Mg–O, and Ca–O are
broader and more asymmetric, resulting from a larger distribution
of distances between oxygen and aluminum, magnesium, and calcium.
From the coordination number distribution of Si and Al, shown in Figure 3, it is clear that
the CMAS glass contains a high fraction of 4-fold-coordinated Si and
Al atoms, which is consistent with a silicate network formed from
corner-sharing SiO4 tetrahedra. For the CMAS sample, an
average coordination number CNSi–O = 3.83 ±
0.2 (Figure 3) is obtained.
Considering the gSi–O(r) distribution (Figure 2d), it is reasonable to consider that the shorter distance of 1.6
Å can be attributed to the SiO4 units which form the
network or partake in the network formation. The initial RMC constraint
of Si connectivity is, therefore, justified because the Si atoms are
coordinated on average to four oxygen neighbors.

2.2 In Situ XRD Studies
Figure 4 shows the high-temperature
(HT)-XRD patterns of the CMAS glass recorded from RT to 900 °C.
The CMAS glass is highly stable and amorphous up to 850 °C. However,
from 850 to 900 °C, low-intensity XRD reflections are observed,
indicating that the crystals have started to precipitate. The observed
XRD reflections correspond to the melilite-based akermanite/gehlenite
crystals (ICDD: 76-7527). Notably, a slow cooling rate (≈2
K min–1) from 900 °C to RT led to an increase
in the intensity of the XRD reflections. However, no additional XRD
reflections corresponding to new crystalline phases were observed
during the cooling process. The position of the HT-XRD reflections
is similar to that of the XRD reflections obtained for the glass-powder
compacts sintered at 900 °C for 1 h, although differences in
intensities are observed. The time for the growth of anorthite nuclei
from their own melts at 900 and 1050 °C has been reported as
92 and 48 h, respectively.22 On the basis
of previous studies12,23,24 and from the in situ XRD results, it is confirmed that a thermal
treatment of 900 °C for 1 h is sufficient to grow the melilite-based
nucleus from the CMAS glass composition.

the CMAS glass-powder compacts obtained during
the heat treatment from RT to 900 °C.

2.3 Quantitative Rietveld Refinement
Quantitative phase analysis proceeded with the Rietveld refinement
of melilite-based phase, employing a composition of Ca2Mg0.35Al1.3Si1.35O7 and,
anorthite, CaAl2Si2O8, in the space
groups P4̅21m and P1̅, respectively. The structural models were based
on published structural data.25 Because
of the large number of refinable parameters in the two structures,
thermal vibration factors, occupancies, and certain atomic positions
were fixed throughout the refinement. The observed diffraction pattern
and difference between the observed and calculated data on the termination
of refinement are shown in Figure 5. Selected structural parameters and agreement factors
are given in Table 1. The calculated amounts of melilite and anorthite were 25.6 and
8.1 wt %, respectively, with the remaining 66.3 wt % amorphous phase.

(red), and melilite (green).

2.4 29Si and 27Al MAS-NMR
Spectroscopic Studies
29Si and 27Al
MAS-NMR spectra of glass and GC samples are displayed in Figure 6. The 29Si MAS-NMR spectrum of the CMAS glass shows a single broad resonance
Q-site distribution with the center of gravity (CG) at −78
ppm. Numerous studies indicate that SiO4 tetrahedra in
glasses normally occur in more than one polymerization state, the
distribution of which is a function of composition.26−28 The appearance
of CG at −78 ppm indicates that this glass is mostly enriched
in Q1 + Q2 units, whereas other Q units including Qn(mAl) units,
where n (ranging from 0 to 4) is the number of bridging
oxygens (BOs) associated with Si and m (ranging from
0 to 4) is the number of Al in the next-nearest neighbor (NNN), are
below the detectable levels.29 However, 27Al MAS-NMR can provide valuable information on the glass
composition as the 27Al chemical shift is strongly dependent
on the aluminum coordination.30 The 27Al MAS-NMR spectrum of the CMAS glass exhibits a broad asymmetric
peak with a tail toward negative parts per million, which is a typical
profile in disordered materials such as glass. The appearance of the
peak at an isotropic shift of about 70 ppm (the isotropic shift is
usually set on the left end of the spectra because of the second-order
quadrupolar shift) but with a maximum at 59 ppm indicates that most
of the Al resides in tetrahedral environments, consistent with the
results obtained from the RMC simulation.31 This is also confirmed by the satellite-transition magic-angle spinning
(STMAS) spectra (Figure S1), in which only
AlO4 sites are observed and no penta- or octahedrally coordinated
Al environments are distinguishable.

Figure 6 29Si and 27Al MAS-NMR
spectra of glass and
GCs. Gh = gehlenite, Ak = akermanite, and An = anorthite.

Solid-state 29Si NMR spectra are highly
sensitive to
the number and type of silicon environments present within the crystal
material, providing a direct correlation between the number of resonances
and the number of crystallographically distinct silicon sites. For
crystalline silicates, the 29Si chemical shift becomes
more negative as the degree of polymerization increases.32,33 However, the substitution of Al for Si on the tetrahedral sites
of framework and sheet silicates caused the 29Si chemical
shift to become less negative by 3–5 ppm per NNN Al.32−34 Moreover, a careful comparison of NMR and diffraction results revealed
that a change in the Si–O bond length of 0.001 Å produced
a difference in the shift of ca. 1 ppm and a change of 1° in
the Si–O–T bond angle led to changes in the 29Si solid-state chemical shift between ca. 0.3 and 0.9 ppm.35,36

Considerable differences are observed in the 29Si MAS-NMR
spectra of the GC samples compared to those of the CMAS glass, most
notably the presence in the former of two main components (Figure 6). The largest contribution
found at ∼−71.9 ppm corresponds to that of aluminum-rich
melilite minerals, also observed in the XRD patterns,29,37 whereas the smaller component located at −84 ppm is typical
of anorthite.38,39 The presence of several overlapping
peaks in the −71 to −85 ppm region can be easily explained
by the presence of various types of silicate tetrahedral units surrounded
by different cations in the melilite-type crystalline phase. However,
deconvolution analysis reveals the appearance of four overlapping
Gaussian peaks, which appear at −71.6, −72, −73.2,
and −76 ppm, in the −71 to −85 ppm range. In
addition to the peak at −84 ppm, the smaller component of the
CMAS-GC sample exhibits two shoulders at −89 and −93
ppm. It is worth mentioning that the smaller component of the GC sample
is similar to but comparatively less well-resolved than that of the
synthetic anorthite synthesized from the parent glass after a heat
treatment at 1400 °C for 179 h.39

Heat treatment at 850 °C for 500 h significantly reduced the
width of the 27Al MAS-NMR spectrum of the glass (Figure 6), but the peak maximum
remains at 56 ppm, indicating that Al is essentially unchanged with
increasing time of thermal treatment. The similarity between the glass
and the GC samples is not surprising because anorthite and melilite
are the dominant crystalline phases in the GC, with most Al residing
in tetrahedral sites with four BOs and four Si neighbors. By contrast,
a small shoulder at 80 ppm appears in the GC sample, which is not
evident in the glass. The 27Al peak maxima for IVAl are known to fall in the range 75–80 ppm for aluminates.40 The formation of linkages between two different
tetrahedral aluminum sites existing in anorthite and in magnesium-rich
melilite is another possible reason for the appearance of the shoulder
at 80 ppm. This feature may correspond to the structural characteristic
frequency of layer-lattice aluminosilicates, the structures of which
consist of two-dimensional octahedral A1O6 sheets alternating
with tetrahedral SiO4 sheets, in which some replacement
of Si by A1 can also occur; the charge imbalance is compensated by
the presence of interlayer cations.41

2.5 Raman Studies
Raman spectroscopy
is widely used to investigate the structural changes in aluminosilicate
glasses because of its capacity to distinguish crystalline phases
and provide indirect information about the structural role of Al3+ ions.42 Raman intensities from
the vibrations of electrostatic bonds, generally appearing between
modifier (M) cations and nonbridging oxygens (NBOs), are approximately
2 orders of magnitude less than those generated from the vibrations
of covalent bonds between the network-former cations and BOs.42 Because of this, the intermolecular vibration
modes of silicate cations dominate the Raman spectra of silicate crystals
and glasses. However, as explained in a previous report,26 the bonding forces between the modifier cation
and NBOs strongly influence the intensity of covalent bonds because
greater covalent character between NBOs and the metal ion tends to
reduce the degree of electron sharing in the Si–O– bonds. Such a behavior explains the variation in the intensity and
the interaction between modifier cations and network formers with
increasing heat treatment time.

The Raman spectrum of CMAS-GC
heat-treated at 850 °C for 500 h, together with the spectra of
akermanite and anorthite, is shown in Figure 7. Within the limits of experimental error,
±2 cm–1, the Raman frequencies observed from
the CMAS-GC spectrum correspond well to the characteristic frequencies
of both melilite-based akermanite/gehlenite43 and anorthite crystalline phases.42 The
phase analysis is also consistent with the corresponding XRD results.
The following features are identified as the corresponding frequencies
of akermanite- and gehlenite-based crystalline phases: (i) the broad
band with a peak position at 912 cm–1 is attributed
to a symmetric stretching motion of terminal NBOs of SiO4, which can be represented as νs(SiO3–); (ii) the band at 988 cm–1 is attributed to an asymmetric stretching vibration of BOs situated
between two tetrahedra (T), which can be represented as νas(SiOSi); (iii) the bands at 661 and 619 cm–1 are ascribed to the symmetric stretching vibrations of BOs νs(TOT), where T = Si or Al, present in akermanite and gehlenite
crystalline phases, respectively;43 and
(iv) the vibration band in the lower frequency region at 311 cm–1 is attributed to a lattice vibrational mode. The
broad band with peak positions at 484 and 504 cm–1 corresponds to the symmetric stretching vibrations of BOs νs(TOT), where T = Si or Al, in the anorthite crystalline phase.42 The peak appearing at 790 cm–1 is attributed to a vibration of Al in the tetrahedral form.42,43

Figure 7 Comparison
of Raman spectra of CMAS-GC heat-treated at 850 °C
for 500 h with those of anorthite and melilite.

Figure 8 shows
the
Raman spectra of CMAS glass powders in the region 300–1100
cm–1 recorded on varying the heat treatment time
from 0 to 400 h at 850 °C. The spectrum at 0 h shows a broad
resonance band, consistent with the amorphous nature of the glass.
Thereafter, well-resolved peaks associated with the crystalline phase
are observed with increasing heat treatment time. However, the peaks
are not as well-resolved (the spectrum shown in red) as those observed
for the CMAS-GC powder compact sample heat-treated at 850 °C
for 500 h (Figure 7). This suggests that powder compaction (decreasing porosity) favors
crystallization as the number of crystals is expected to increase.
It is worth mentioning that the peak positions are identical throughout
the measured spectrum range in both the GCs.

Figure 8 In situ Raman spectra
for GC heat-treated at 850 °C for 400
h.

The spectrum of the glass powder
before heat treatment (0 h) exhibits
an intense, asymmetric, broad peak at 930 cm–1 (Figure 8), which is attributed
to the symmetric stretching of terminal NBOs νs(SiO3). Whereas the intensity of this band decreases with increasing
heat treatment time from 0 to 400 h, the broad area decreases from
0 to 240 h and then increases with further increasing heat treatment
time up to 400 h. Correspondingly, the peak position shifts toward
a lower wave number with increasing time of treatment from 0 to 240
h then shifts toward a higher wave number with increasing heat treatment
time from 240 to 264 h, before stabilizing with further increasing
time of treatment. A shoulder appearing at the low-frequency side
of the νs(SiO3–) band
at ∼790 cm–1 is attributed to the AlO4 units present at a site with point group symmetry 4̅
in melilite. The intensity of this shoulder decreases with increasing
time of heat treatment up to its disappearance after 240 h. Nevertheless,
an additional new peak with very low intensity appears again at ∼790
cm–1 after 260 h, the intensity of which increases
with increasing time of heat treatment. The second, high-intensity,
broad band appearing at 577 cm–1 after 240 h of
heat treatment is attributed to the symmetric stretching vibrations
of BO situated between two Si tetrahedra, represented as νs(SiOSi). A shoulder at 647 cm–1 accompanied
by a band peaking at 620 cm–1 due to the symmetric
stretching mode of νs(TOT) (where T = Si or Al) is
also observed up to 288 h; these bands then tend to overlap with the
νs(SiOSi) broad band with further increasing heat
treatment time. The third intense band observed at 311 cm–1 corresponds to the lattice vibrational mode, which is not much influenced
by increasing heat treatment time. All three strong bands, appearing
at 912, 661, and 311 cm–1, are characteristic frequencies
of melilite, as reported previously.43 In
addition, bands of low intensity with the characteristic frequencies
of anorthite42 appear at 504 cm–1, accompanied with a shoulder at 484 cm–-1, and 998 cm–1, corresponding to the symmetric
and antisymmetric stretching vibrations of BO, νs(SiOSi) and νas(SiOSi), respectively. The intensity
of these bands increases with increasing heat treatment time from
240 h. The band appearing at 504 cm–1, characteristic
of the feldspar structure, is attributed to the four-membered-ring
structure in anorthite, whereas the shoulder at 484 cm–1, although not well-studied, arises from the combinations of six-
and three-membered-ring structures.43

3 Discussion
The average oxygen coordination
number around Si should be very
close to four atoms, which is required for the formation of tetrahedral
units in the network. Nevertheless, the obtained average value for
CNSi–O of 3.833 from the RMC simulations indicates
the presence of slightly distorted tetrahedral units in the glass
structure. We have also found that Al atoms are 4-fold oxygen-coordinated
and have formed AlO4 tetrahedral units, as also confirmed
by the 27Al MAS-NMR glass spectrum, similar to the basic
SiO4 network units. Therefore, the formation of slightly
distorted SiO4 tetrahedral units in the CMAS glass structure
is likely attributable to the formation of mixed Si–O–Al
chains, where Al atoms are coordinated by four oxygen atoms.

The appearance of sharp peaks at −71.6 and −73.2
ppm in the NMR spectra for the CMAS-GC represents two different types
of dimer units, gehlenite AlSiO7 and akermanite Si2O7 units, respectively.37,44 Because the 29Si MAS-NMR chemical shifts of crystalline
silicates are highly sensitive to short-range order effects,35,36 the presence of additional broad peaks at −72 and −76
ppm represents a glassy phase with structural units longer than dimers
precipitated after the formation of melilite crystalline phase. This
polymerization may occur because of the role of alumina, which converts
NBOs to BOs through the formation of Si–O–Al linkages
as postulated by Stebbins et al.45−47

In situ XRD results
revealed that no additional phases were crystallized
either upon heating from RT to 900 °C or upon cooling from 900
°C to RT. This suggests that the delayed appearance of anorthite
in the CMAS-GC is mainly due to a sluggish growth mechanism.48 It can be concluded, therefore, that anorthite
has formed from the heterogeneous glass composition that remains after
the growth of melilite-based crystalline phase. However, the 29Si MAS-NMR spectrum of well-ordered anorthite should contain
eight equally intense peaks because the structural units are composed
of eight nonequivalent Si sites. As shown previously, the 29Si peaks can shift with higher temperature, resulting in only three
overlapping peaks with a relative ratio of 3:3:2.49 Therefore, the peaks in the range of −93 to −81
ppm (Figure 6) are
assigned to the Q4(4Al) units, which are characteristics
of anorthite.49 On the other hand, the
broad peak appearing at a more negative chemical shift can be assigned
to a disordered aluminosilicate framework, which commonly contains
0–4IVAl units as NNNs for Si.

The peak at
577 cm–1 in the Raman spectrum for
0 h of heat treatment is more typical of the glass structure of gehlenite,
in which Al3+ ions act to a large extent as a network former,
existing as (AlSiO7) dimers. The broad and highly intense
νs(SiO–) vibration band, in comparison
to the νs(TOT) vibration band, in the present spectrum
recorded at 850 °C after 0 h indicates a large distribution of Qn units. The peak at 926 cm–1 appears at a shift similar to that of the peak observed
in the Raman spectrum of the akermanite glass.43 This is expected because, as confirmed by XRD, the CMAS
glass is based on the melilite solid solution. The shift in the νs(SiO–) mode toward a lower wave number,
along with the decrease in the peak width with increasing heat treatment
time up to 240 h, is credited to the formation of the melilite crystalline
phase. It has been reported that for clinopyroxene crystalline materials
containing Al, that is, CaAl2SiO6 (CaTs), the
νs(SiO–) band appears at lower
frequencies (953 cm–1) than aluminum-free pyroxene,
CaMgSi2O6 (∼1000 cm–1).42 This shift in frequency is attributed
to the isomorphous substitution of Al3+ for Si4+ in the chains, resulting in longer T–O bonds (l.636 Å)
in CaTs than the average Si–O bond length (1.634 Å) in
diopside. In the present glass system, the small shift in frequency
(30 cm–1) indicates that during the formation of
crystalline phases, T–O bond lengths may increase and therefore
exhibit correspondingly lower force constants.

Sharma et al.50 reported that the νs(SiOSi)
mode in Raman spectra is highly sensitive to the bond
angle, bond length, and short-range connectivity.50 The frequencies of the νs(TOT) bands in
the spectra of the crystalline melilites exhibit a distinct linear
relationship with the T–O–T bridging angle of the pyrosilicate
unit, whereby increasing bond angle increases the resonance frequency.43 In the present case, the shift in band frequency
toward higher values with the increase in heat treatment time from
0 to 240 h suggests structural rearrangement around the BO through
increasing the T–O–T bond angle. This increase may be
due to the formation and the participation of AlO4 and
MgO4 tetrahedral units in melilite crystal formation because
the structure is composed of layers of (Si,Al) and (Mg,Al) tetrahedra
connected by Ca in 8-fold coordination between the layers.51,52 A small cation size, high field strength, and the possible existence
of MgO4 tetrahedra suggest that Mg can compete with aluminum
in network-forming positions. The main peak corresponding to MgO4 tetrahedral vibrations should appear at 587 cm–1.43,53 However, because of the broadness of the
spectra, features attributable to the Mg–O stretching vibrations
were not identified accurately. In any case, the increase in frequency
and the appearance of peaks at 620 and 646 cm–1,
which are characteristic frequencies of gehlenite and akermanite crystalline
phases, in the spectrum for 240 h of heat treatment confirm that AlO4 and MgO4 units participate in the formation of
melilite-type gehlenite/akermanite crystalline phase with increasing
duration of heat treatment.

With a further increase in the heat
treatment time from 240 to
290 h, the peak appearing at 794 cm–1 diminishes
in intensity, placing in doubt the presence of AlO4 units
in the melilite solid solution.52 However,
the peak at 507 cm–1, attributable to the characteristic
νs(SiOSi) vibration mode of anorthite crystalline
phase, increases in intensity. This result suggests that a fraction
of AlO4-containing dimer units may have reacted with the
glassy phase that remains after the formation of melilite crystalline
phase and then converted into four-membered rings. The increase in
the bandwidth of the νs(SiO–) mode
further confirms the disproportion reaction 2Qn ⇔ Qn–1 + Qn+1. Gehlenite, usually considered as an intermediate compound
that becomes unstable in the presence of SiO2 and Al2O3, has likely reacted to give anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8) through the following reaction54,55 1  

Moreover, on the basis of the in situ XRD results
at various temperatures,
it is reported that akermanite does not decompose into other compounds;
otherwise, wollastonite and monticellite should appear.56,57 No such crystalline phases have been encountered in the present
glass system.

As already mentioned, the 27Al MAS-NMR
spectra clearly
reveal that most Al exists in the form of AlO4 units. Therefore,
assuming that Mg2+ ions participate in the formation of
melilite-like crystalline phase, the presence of four-membered rings
along with eight-coordinated Ca2+ cations leads to the
formation of crystalline anorthite from the residual glassy phase,
confirmed from the presence of a band at 327 cm–1. The increases in the bandwidth and frequency and the decrease in
the intensity of the νs(SiO–) band
further confirm the structural rearrangement and disproportion reaction
which occur with further increase in the heat treatment time. The
decrease in the intensity can be attributed to the degree of covalence
of the Al–O bonds. However, no additional crystalline phases
have been observed even after 500 h of heat treatment. The presence
of a broad band may, therefore, be assigned to the resonance vibrations
of melilite and anorthite crystalline structural units. This clearly
confirms that anorthite crystalline phase forms during the period
of 240–290 h of heat treatment time from the residual phase,
which is rich in Al2O3, SiO2, and
CaO.

The present study clearly illustrates that the CMAS chemical
composition
is highly stable up to 850 °C, forming crystals with a composition
close to that of the parent glass. Nevertheless, during prolonged
heat treatment at 850 °C, anorthite crystallizes owing to the
interaction with the glassy phase, which is rich in Al2O3, SiO2, and gehlenite crystalline units.
This suggests that decreasing the concentration of Al2O3 in the precipitated glassy phase would inhibit the formation
of undesired anorthite phase. This could be realized with the partial
replacement of MgO for Al2O3 in the initial
CMAS glass position. The rationale behind the selection of MgO is
that it may increase the fraction of akermanite and does not much
alter the properties of the CMAS glass sealing material.12 Studies of such glass compositions are under
progress, and the results will be reported in our forthcoming articles.

4 Conclusions
The mechanism for the deleterious formation
of anorthite in a melilite-based
CMAS-GC composition with the potential as a sealing material for SOFCs
has been revealed from the experimental data gathered through a number
of complementary advanced characterization techniques (ND, XRD, MAS-NMR,
and in situ Raman). The glass network, as revealed by ND data and
MAS-NMR spectra, is mainly composed of SiO4 and AlO4 structural units. The high stability of CMAS glass up to
850 °C was confirmed by in situ XRD. In addition to SiO4 and AlO4 units, quantitative XRD and MAS-NMR analyses
also suggest that the melilite phase homogeneously forms along with
the inclusion of MgO4 tetrahedral units above the glass-transition
temperature at 900 °C during the initial heat treatment period.
Peaks at −72 and −76 ppm in the 29Si MAS-NMR
spectrum of the GC confirm that the glassy phase remaining after the
melilite formation has a more polymerized structure than simple dimer
units, attributable to the glass-forming role of alumina present in
the remaining glass composition. The gehlenite crystalline phase in
the melilite solid solution is not stable beyond 240 h of heat treatment
as concluded from the decreasing intensity of the Raman peak at 794
cm–1 attributed to AlO4 units. A late
and gradual reaction between gehlenite and the highly polymerized
remaining glassy phase leads to the formation of crystalline anorthite.

5 Experimental Details
5.1 Material Preparation
CMAS glass of
composition 38.7CaO–9.7MgO–12.9Al2O3–38.7SiO2 (mol %)12 was
prepared by melting the batch in a Pt-crucible at 1590 °C for
1 h and then quenching the glass melts in cold water. The experimental
procedure for the preparation of glasses and glass powders has been
detailed in our previous report.12 The
glass-transition temperature was observed around 730 °C. GC sample
was obtained using a powder-processing technique, in which the glass
powders with a mean particle size in the range 10–15 μm
were pressed uniaxially (80 MPa) to form rectangular bars with dimensions
of 4 mm × 5 mm × 50 mm. The as-formed rectangular glass-powder
compacts were first sintered at 900 °C for 1 h and then further
heat-treated at 850 °C for 500 h in air at a heating rate of
5 K min–1.

5.2 Neutron Diffraction
Neutron diffraction
measurements were performed at the 10 MW Budapest research reactors
using the two-axis position sensitive detector diffractometer (monochromatic
wavelength λ0 = 1.068 Å).58 A powder specimen of ∼3 g was placed in a cylindrical
vanadium sample holder (8 mm diameter, 50 mm height, and 0.07 mm wall
thickness). The diffraction pattern was measured in the momentum transfer
range of 0.95 ≤ Q ≤ 9.5 Å–1. Correction and normalization procedures were utilized
to obtain the structure factor, S(Q), from the raw experimental data using program packages available
at the facility.

The experimental S(Q) data were simulated by the RMC method59 using the software package RMC++.60 The RMC method minimizes the squared difference
between the experimental S(Q) and
the calculated value from a three-dimensional atomic configuration.
The RMC algorithm calculates the one-dimensional partial atomic pair
correlation functions gij(r), which are then inverse-Fourier-transformed
to calculate the partial structure factors, Sij(Q) 2  where rmax is
the half edge length of the simulation box of the RMC calculation.
The actual computer configuration is modified by moving the atoms
randomly until the calculated S(Q) agrees with the experimental data to within the limits of experimental
error. For the RMC starting model, a disordered atomic configuration
was built up with a simulation box containing 10 000 atoms.
The density value was 0.070 atoms·Å–3,
and the corresponding RMC half-box length was 26.13 Å. Moves
are accepted only if they are in accordance with certain constraints.

Here, two types of constraints were applied to obtain a reliable
three-dimensional atomic configuration, described by the partial atomic
pair correlation functions, gij(r). These included the minimum interatomic
distances between atom pairs (cutoff distances) and connectivity of
the network-former Si–O atom pairs, assuming that the silicon
atoms are surrounded by four-coordinated oxygen atoms, forming tetrahedral
SiO4 units; the silicon atoms were thus required to have
four oxygen neighbors at a distance of between 1.5 and 2.1 Å.

Several RMC runs were completed by modifying the cutoff distances,
and the results of each run were carefully checked to obtain reliable
data for each gij(r) and coordination number distributions, CNij(n). The partial atomic pair correlations, gij(r), were
revealed from the RMC simulation with good reproducibility and acceptable
statistics.

5.3 X-ray Diffraction
The initiation
of crystalline phase formation with temperature in the glass powders
was monitored from RT to 900 °C by in situ HT-XRD, employing
a Philips X’Pert diffractometer. The implemented heat treatment
schedule for the hot stage was as follows: RT to 550 °C at a
heating rate of 30 K min–1 and from 550 to 900 °C
at 5 K min–1 followed by a dwell at 900 °C
for 1 h. The XRD data were collected at RT, at 550 °C, and every
50 °C in the interval from 550 to 900 °C without any significant
dwell. The XRD data were also collected at RT after the completion
of the hot stage-heating schedule to identify the formation of any
additional crystalline phases during the cooling process.

The
powder XRD patterns at RT were collected using monochromatic Cu Kα1 radiation over the range 15° ≤ 2θ ≤
100° (step width of 0.02°) with a conventional Bragg–Brentano
diffractometer (Philips PW3710, Ni-filter). The fraction of crystallized
components in the GC after thermal treatment for 500 h was estimated
by Rietveld quantitative analysis in a manner similar to that described
previously.61 The GCs were powdered in
an agate mortar with the addition of Al2O3,
which served as an internal weight standard, prior to sieving through
a 60 μm mesh. Rietveld refinement was carried out with the FullProf
software62 using interpolation of points
to model the background.

5.4 Solid-State MAS-NMR
27Al solid-state NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker
Avance-III
HD operated at a B0 field of 14.1 T. The 27Al (156.4 MHz) 1D experiments were carried out after a small
5° flip angle of 0.5 μs at a spinning speed of 20 kHz using
a 3.2 mm MAS HFXY quadruple resonance probe (Bruker). The reference
was set using a solution of AlCl3 adjusted to a pH of 1
with hydrochloric acid.

29Si MAS-NMR spectra were
recorded on a Bruker Avance-II spectrometer operated at 59.62 MHz
(7.1 T) using a 7 mm probe at a spinning rate of 5 kHz. The one-pulse
experiments were carried out with a 90° pulse length of 4.4 μs
and recycle times of 60 s for CMAS glass and 1800 s for CMAS-GC. The
chemical shift was referenced to TMS using N(SiMe3)3 as a secondary reference.

5.5 Raman
Spectroscopy
RT Raman spectra
were obtained using a Horiba LabRAM HR 800 Evolution confocal Raman
microscope, with a 532 nm excitation laser and a 100× objective
lens (NA = 0.9). The incident laser power projected on the samples
was ∼10 mW, and the spot size was ∼3.14 μm2. The collected Raman radiation was dispersed with a 600 lines·mm–1 grating and focused on a Peltier-cooled charge-coupled
device (CCD) detector, allowing a spectral resolution of ca. 5 cm–1. All spectra were recorded in the range 200–1200
cm–1 with an integration time of 1 s and three accumulations
per spectrum.

Raman spectra were collected on samples placed
in a controlled-atmosphere chamber at elevated temperatures, which
was recently developed for in situ studies of p-SOFC interfaces.63,64 The optical system of the setup comprises a 30 mW green (532 nm)
laser with 20–25 μm spot size, a polarizer which decreases
the power of the laser radiation when necessary, a mechanical shutter
stopping the excitation beam for system tuning, and a set of collecting
lenses and mirrors. The scattered light is distributed into different
directions by a 600 lines·mm–1 diffraction
grating monochromator MDR-12 (LOMO, Russia) and registered with a
Peltier-cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, 1024 × 1024
pixel resolution). The spectra were recorded in the range 70–2050
cm–1 with an integration time of 1 s and 5–300
accumulations per spectrum. The measurements reported in this work
were performed at 25–900 °C in atmospheric air, with glass
or GC samples placed onto a single-crystal sapphire support; the accuracy
of temperature control was ±1 °C.
