We have synthesized a new class of
organolead halide perovskite
nanocrystals by a solvent-free mechanochemical green approach. We
have developed a new combination of precursor by incorporating nitrate
ions into the MAPbBr3 perovskite core. While the presence
of nitrate ion is evidenced by Fourier-transform infrared spectra,
X-ray diffraction data shows the formation of perovskite nanocrystals.
By altering the precursor composition, the morphology of the nanocrystals
changes. Photoluminescence properties of these nanocrystals are preserved.
Moreover, the stability of these nanocrystals is monitored for a long
time, which shows that the incorporation of nitrate ions into the
perovskite nanocrystal core does not have any decremental effect on
its stability. Nonetheless, this strategy to synthesize perovskite
nanocrystals reduces the solvent toxicity.

Introduction
The organometal halide
perovskite materials have attracted considerable
attention in recent years due to their high absorption ability and
long-range electron–hole diffusion length.1−3 They show potential
candidacy for photovoltaic applications and rapidly accomplished stupendous
performance.4 This perovskite family obeys
ABX3 stoichiometry, where A is the monovalent cation, B
is the bivalent metal cation, and X is the halide anion (e.g., Cl–, Br–, I–). These
perovskites are highly unstable against moisture;5,6 therefore,
protection against moisture is of prime interest. The stability of
the perovskite layer can be improved by increasing the intrinsic stability
of the perovskites.7,8 While numerous studies on bulk
lead halide perovskites exist in the literature, less attention has
been directed toward the synthesis and stability of CH3NH3PbX3 quantum dots.9,10 Perovskite
nanocrystals display interesting properties such as band-gap expansion,
energy level quantization and slower electron–phonon relaxation.11−15 The potential to tune the optical response of perovskites by altering
their size and shape is useful for a range of light-emitting applications.16−18

Numerous methods have been employed to achieve considerable
stability
of the perovskite materials. Park and co-workers19 investigated the stability of organometallic perovskites
using lead nitrate solution as a Pb2+ source in place of
conventional PbI2-dimethylformamide solution. The lead
nitrate residue in MAPbI3 slowed the accelerated decomposition
as the lead nitrate residue acted as a water scavenger. Miyasaka and
co-workers20 have used aqueous lead nitrate
solution to synthesize organolead halide perovskites with 12.58% power
conversion efficiency and to avoid toxic solvents like dimethylformamide.
It was investigated that the formation of MAPbI3 from Pb(NO3)2 is a two-step reaction involving the rapid formation
of PbI2 intermediates and the slow reaction of PbI2 and MAI to form MAPbI3. On the other hand, less
effort has been devoted on the substitution of a halide counter ion
for stability enhancement. Alivisatos and co-workers21 put an effort to stabilize perovskite nanocrystals by encapsulating
them into polymer matrices. Similarly, Zhang and co-workers22 have used a technique in which monomer units
are polymerized during the synthesis of MAPbBr3 nanocrystals.
This perovskite–polymer nanocomposite shows a remarkable stability
enhancement in air and resistance to water.

Herein, we have
demonstrated highly luminescent nitrate-incorporated
new mixed halide perovskite nanocrystals with remarkable stability.
We have explored the compositional engineering of a mixed halide for
high photoluminescence (PL) properties.

There are only a few
reports on substitution of halide ions in
perovskite for optoelectronic devices.23−27 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report
that demonstrates the incorporation of a nitrate ion substituting
the halide counterpart. We employed a relatively green approach, namely,
solvent-free mechanochemical synthetic28 methodology for mixed halide-nitrate-based perovskite nanocrystals.

In this study, nitrate was introduced using the molar ratio of
MABr and Pb(NO3)2 to prepare MAPbBr(NO3)2 (PNC-1), while MA(NO3) and PbBr2 were used in a molar ratio to synthesize MAPbBr2(NO3) (PNC-2). The tolerance factor calculated for these compounds
(in Supporting Information) does not deviate
from that for the perovskite structure. However, we used a different
synthetic approach for the solid solution synthesis. Octylamine was
used as only capping ligand, while no other stabilizing ligand was
used. The absence of oleic acid can keep the solid solution more stable
even for several months.29−31 The synthesis strategy is depicted
in Scheme 1. The detailed
synthetic procedure is described in the Supporting Information. The motivation is that the heat generated by mechanical
mixing supplies sufficient energy for the crystallization of PNCs.
When the precursor solids were ground for 4 min with a rotation speed
of 130–140 rpm in a 3 in. diameter mortar, the perovskite crystallization
process started; however, the process would be blocked by octylamine.
It is worth mentioning that the shape of the nanocrystals is highly
controlled by the stoichiometric ratio of nitrate ions. In this report,
we have explored (i) the introduction of nitrate ion into the perovskite
core, (ii) use of a green synthetic approach, and (iii) octylamine
capping ligand as a modified ligand environment. Purification of synthesized
perovskite nanocrystals is done using acetone for PNC-2 and ethyl
acetate for PNC-1.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Strategy of PNC-1 and PNC-2
Result and Discussion
We have studied the optical properties
of these nanocrystals. The
green luminescent solid solution of MAPbBr3–x(NO3)x nanoparticles
shows absorption and emission peaks at 523 and 555 nm, respectively,
as shown in Figure 1a, and at 544 and 553 nm, as shown in Figure 1b for PNC-1 and PNC-2. The absorption edge
presents a negligible shift with the change of stoichiometric ratio
of the NO3– ion, indicating almost similar
band gaps of 2.2 and 2.1 eV for PNC-1 and PNC-2, respectively. The
small Stokes shifts of 32 nm for PNC-1 and 9 nm for PNC-2 can be attributed
to the direct exciton recombination process. Figure S1 (in the Supporting Information) shows the digital image
of the mechnochemical synthesis of the perovskite solid solution under
daylight and UV light (λ = 365 nm). The most striking property
of perovskite nanocrystals is their strong photoluminescence. In the
PL spectrum, a sharp emission peak for PNC-1 at 555 nm with a full
width at half maximum (FWHM) value of 20 and at 553 nm with a FWHM
value of 20 nm for PNC-2 can be observed, indicating a color saturation.
We have performed experiments for absolute quantum yield with integrated
sphere. PLQY for PNC-1 is evaluated as 23% and for PNC-2 as 10%.The
existence of nitrate in the perovskite nanocrystals is investigated
by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and the characteristic
peak at 1386 cm–1 is observed for nitrate in PNC-1
and PNC-2. Looking into the comparative data of FT-IR spectra, it
is observed that the doublet in PNC-1 and PNC-2 in the region 3300–3500
cm–1 corresponds to the primary amine group of ligand
octylamine. Also, peaks at 2852, 2922, and 2962 cm–1 correspond to the −CH stretching of the ligand and peaks
at 1600 cm–1 correspond to the C=C mode of
the ligand. Finally, 1450 and 1300 cm–1 peaks are
corresponding to CH bending vibrations. These peaks have shown the
presence of ligand on purified perovskite nanocrystals (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information).

X-ray diffraction patterns of PNC-1 and PNC-2 along with pure MAPbBr3.

To investigate the structural
characteristics of the mixed perovskites,
we performed X-ray diffraction as shown in Figure 1c. The results show that the X-ray diffraction
(XRD) spectra of the two mixed perovskite samples exhibit identical
characteristic diffraction. The XRD spectra of mixed perovskite show
diffraction peaks at 2θ = 14.84 and 30.08° corresponding
to (001) and (002), for PNC-2. In the case of PNC-1, XRD peaks corresponding
to the perovskite structure are at 14.94 and 30.12° for (001)
and (002) facets, respectively. XRD details are provided in Tables S1 and S2, in the Supporting Information.
In both the perovskites, the peak intensities of (001) and (002) are
very high, indicating the stronger preferred orientation of these
facets.

A small shift of the diffraction peak of 15.02°
is attributed
to the nitrate doping (detailed in the Supporting Information Figure S3). It is evident that the high crystallinity
and preferred orientation will influence charge dissociation and transport.
Notably, XRD is most consistent with the cubic perovskite phase, suggesting
that the cubic phase of pure MAPbBr3 is preserved. The
XRD data of the precursor is shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S4).

To investigate the surface
composition and chemical state of the
elements in the sample, XPS spectra of PNC-1 and PNC-2 were recorded. Figure 2a,b shows the survey
spectra of PNC-1 and PNC-2, respectively. The survey scan consists
of peaks of carbon, nitrogen, bromine, lead, and oxygen ions. The
high-resolution spectrum of Pb4f, represented in Figure 2c for PNC-1, shows two lead
peaks (doublet) at 139.07 and 143.96 eV. Similarly, Figure 2d shows two lead peaks (doublet)
at 138.32 and 143.2 eV for PNC-2. Figure 2e,f shows peaks of the bromine ion, which
have some influence of nitrate ions at 68.80, 69.89 and 67.99, 69.01
for PNC-1 and PNC-2, respectively. The N 1s spectrum shown in Figure S5 (in the Supporting Information) indicates
the existing chemical states of the N element. The peaks at 399.9
eV for PNC-1 and 400.01 eV for PNC-2 originate from methylamine salt.
The peaks at 413.7 and 413.2 for PNC-1 and PNC-2, respectively, originate
from the incorporated nitrate ion. The O 1s XPS narrow scan as shown
in the Supporting Information (Figure S5) for PNC-1 and PNC-2 contains a single peak at 532.41 eV and 532.2,
respectively, resulting from oxygen atoms of nitrate (Table S3). XPS narrow scans for C 1s in PNC-1
and PNC-2 are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S5). The XPS data of all precursors is shown in the
Supporting Information (Figure S6).

XPS spectra corresponding to Pb of PNC-1. (d) High-resolution XPS
spectra corresponding to Pb of PNC-2. (e) Narrow scan of Br of PNC-1.
(f) Narrow scan of Br of PNC-2.

These newly derived nanocrystals were characterized by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). The TEM image of PNC-1 in Figure 3a,b shows well-defined short
rod-shaped nanocrystals. However, the PNC-2 nanocrystals exhibit a
long rodlike uniform structure, as represented in Figure 3d,e. The crystalline structure
of PNC-1 and PNC-2 can be confirmed by the selected area electron
diffraction (SAED) pattern, which gives bright and sharp diffraction
spots as shown in Figure 3c,f, respectively. Most of the hybrid perovskites are unstable
under electron beam irradiation during high-resolution TEM characterization.
The aggregated form of the nanocrystals exhibits cubic nature on a
micrometer scale reflected by the SEM image as shown in Figures S7 and S8 (Supporting Information). The
presence of all elements in PNC-1 and PNC-2 is further confirmed by
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis shown in the Supporting
Information (Figures S7 and S8).

PNC-1 with (a) 500 nm scale bar and (b) 200 nm scale
bar. (c) SAED pattern of PNC-1. TEM image of PNC-2 with (d) 500 nm
scale bar and (e) 200 nm scale bar. (f) SAED pattern of PNC-2.

Another appealing characteristics of these newly
synthesized nanocrystals
are their higher sensitivity toward moisture, light irradiation, and
heat. In this work, we have tested the stability of PNC-1 and PNC-2
with storage in an ambient environment. PNC-2 shows high stability
up to 1410 h (58 days) without degradation (Figure 4a,b). It is worth mentioning that the emission
intensity drastically decreased within 24 h and then increased continuously
for about 2 months in open air. However, Figure 4c represents the stability of PNC-2 upon
addition of water. The stability of PNC-1 is shown in the Supporting
Information (Figure S9). Notably, the stability
of both the samples increases remarkably with time. PL enhancement
might happen because water molecules from moisture split into H3O+ and OH–, which act as active
ligands for perovskite nanocrystals.

emission spectra for
PNC-2. (b) Plot of PL intensity vs time for PNC-2. (c) Quenching of
emission peak upon addition of water for PNC-2 with respect to time.
(d) CIE coordinate plot for PNC-1 and PNC-2.

This active ligand enhances fluorescence, and after some span of
time, these water molecules penetrate deep into the structure and
degrade it.32 On the other hand, water
molecule interact with the nitrate ions. Thus, an increase in nitrate
ions decreases the stability of the samples as it is reflected by
PNC-1 and PNC-2. However, colloidal solutions of PNC-1 and PNC-2 show
reasonable stability in solution, as shown in the Supporting Information
(Figure S10). CIE coordinates were calculated
as x = 0.36 and y = 0.59 (for PNC-1)
and x = 0.34 and y = 0.62 (for PNC-2)
using CIE 1931 as shown in Figure 4d. The high-quality stable green luminescent PNC-1
and PNC-2 provide opportunities to explore them toward display technology.

Also, time-dependent studies of PNC-2 have been probed through
TEM, XRD, XPS, and SEM analyses to know more about its stability (SEM
in the Supporting Information, Figure S11). There are no changes in morphology up to 30 days, indicating it
to be very stable (Figure 5a). Also, there is no change in XRD of PNC-2 up to 30 days,
which is again a strong indication of its stability (Figure 5b). XPS studies reveal about
the binding energy of various ions including carbon, nitrogen, oxygen,
lead, and bromide ions (Figure 6). Similarly, time-dependent TEM, XRD, SEM, and XPS analyses
have been carried out for PNC-1 as shown in Figures S12–S15 in the Supporting Information.

with respect to days. (b) Time-dependent

Conclusions
In summary, we have
successfully introduced NO3– into the
perovskite nanocrystal core using a solvent-free
mechanochemical process. This green approach reduces the toxicity
caused by the solvent used for the synthesis of these perovskite nanocrystals.
Moreover, these newly synthesized nanocrystals exhibit strong luminescent
properties. The morphology of the nanocrystals is controlled by changing
the ratio of the dopant anion. These nitrate-doped perovskite nanocrystals
exhibit better stability in ambient conditions, enabling storage for
several months. The detailed study on the stability enhancement of
these nitrate-incorporated perovskite nanocrystals in ambient environment
is under progress. This work may open up a new avenue for the replication
of conventional perovskite nanocrystals with a better stability.

Experimental
Section
All of the chemicals were purchased from commercial
sources and
were used as received. Lead(II) bromide (99%), methylamine solution
(33 wt % in absolute ethanol), and octylamine are purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Other reagents like lead nitrate, nitric acid (70% in water, SRL),
and hydrobromic acid (48 wt % in water, SRL) were ordered from local
suppliers.

Methylammonium Nitrate (MA(NO3)) Synthesis
Briefly, in a 50 mL flask, 5.14 mL of CH3NH2, 40% in methanol, was mixed with 10 mL of ethanol. Then, at room
temperature, 6 mL of HNO3 was added dropwise with continuous
stirring. The obtained solution was placed in a rotary evaporator
at 60°C for removing all solvents. Then, after washing with diethyl
ether several times, the solid product of MANO3 was obtained.

Methylammonium Bromide (MABr) Synthesis
Briefly, in
a 50 mL flask, 5.14 mL of CH3NH2, 40% in methanol,
was mixed with 10 mL of ethanol. Then, at room temperature, 6 mL of
HBr was added dropwise with continuous stirring. The obtained solution
was placed in a rotary evaporator at 60°C for removing all solvents.
Then, after washing with diethyl ether several times, the solid product
of MABr was obtained.

MAPbBr(NO3)2/MAPbBr2(NO3) Mechanochemical Synthesis
1. For synthesis of
MAPbBr(NO3)2, 0.2 mmol of MABr is ground with
0.2 mmol of Pb(NO3)2 in a mortar pestle. Further,
20 μL of
octylamine is added and ground continuously for 3–5 min; it
gives bright green fluorescence.

2. For synthesis of MAPbBr2(NO3),
a similar method is followed. First, 0.2 mmol of
MA(NO3) and 0.2 mmol of PbBr2 are ground in
a mortar pestle, and then addition of 20 μL of octylamine with
continuous grinding leads to bright green fluorescence.



We have purified the samples with a variety of solvents.
Acetone is used for PNC-2, and ethyl acetate is used for PNC-1. After
isolating the nanocrystals, we have calculated the product yield for
respective perovskite nanocrystals as 70% (PNC-1) and 97% (PNC-2).

For further characterizations including UV and PL measurements,
sample preparation had been done be making a thin film on a glass
slide with the help of a doctor blade.
