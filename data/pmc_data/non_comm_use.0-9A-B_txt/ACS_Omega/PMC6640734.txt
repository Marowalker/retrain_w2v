Organic dyes can be excellent catalysts
for photoredox chemistry,
offering low price, low toxicity, and an exceptional range of available
materials. Their use has been limited because in comparison to their
transition-metal catalysts the spectroscopic, kinetic, and electrochemical
information available is far more limited. To remediate this situation,
we have determined the necessary data for 14 readily available dyes
with excellent potential as photoredox catalysts. We have also demonstrated
the utility of these dyes through visible-light-mediated reductive
dehalogenation and Aza-Henry reactions. We envision that this collection
of data will lead to an increase in the use of cationic dyes in photoredox
processes because users will find the necessary information readily
available.

Introduction
In
recent years, the field of light-mediated redox catalysis has
experienced remarkable growth because light can provide spatial and
temporal control in organic synthesis1−3 under generally mild
conditions. Transition-metal complexes, such as Ru(II) and Ir(III)
bypiridyl complexes, have been extensively employed in these transformations.
The use of organic dyes as photocatalysts for these reactions has
also been examined in a few cases,4,5 including examples
from the König group with Eosin Y,6 the Nicewicz group with acridinium salts,7−9 and our own
group with methylene blue.10,11

Given the low
price, low toxicity, and demonstrated ability to
perform as redox photoctalysts, the limited use of organic dyes is
rather surprising. We hypothesize that one of the primary reasons
underlying the popularity of Ru(II) and Ir(III) complexes is that
both their photophysical and electrochemical properties have been
readily available for over 30 years.12−14 A few organic dyes are
just as well understood, for example, methylene blue, but this is
not the case for many of the dye options available. In fact, whereas
in some cases organic dyes can be even more reactive than their transition-metal
counterparts,10,15,16 the same exhaustive collection of photophysical data does not exist
in the literature for these photosensitizers. In screening organic
dyes for our own work, we realized that this information may be extremely
valuable for those in the field and that some of the measurements
that we performed with ease in our laboratory are not widely available.

In this article, we provide essential photochemical and electrochemical
data for a collection four distinct classes of cationic dyes (Figure 1) that may aid in
increasing their use in photoredox catalysis.17−19 We provide
a detailed information chart for each of the 14 organic dyes along
with the 2 most common Ru and Ir photosensitizers. In addition to
these 16 charts, the Supporting Information includes all of the original data for those requiring details in
addition to those summarized in the Appendix.

in this work and a typical photoredox cycle.

Cationic dyes are excellent candidates for photocatalysis
because
they provide the advantage of being economically viable while also
displaying improved photophysical properties such as increased light
absorption across the visible spectrum and longer triplet excited-state
lifetimes in comparison to their transition-metal counterparts. In
this work, we compare the efficiencies of our cationic dyes with two
ubiquitous photoredox catalysts, Ru(bpy)3Cl2 and fac-Ir(ppy)3, along with the 9-mesityl-10-methylacridinium
cation originally synthesized by Fukuzumi and co-workers.20 The photosensitizers were compared in both the
reduction of meso-1,2-dibromo-1,2-diphenylethane
originally studied by Willner in 199021 and the light-mediated Aza-Henry reaction originally studied by
Stephenson in 2010.22 Importantly, we also
demonstrate that favorable kinetics of electron transfer for mechanistically
key steps can correlate to increased reaction efficiency, highlighting
the importance of investigating not only the thermodynamic feasibility
but also the kinetic feasibility of the catalytic system. Finally,
we provide a comprehensive summary of both the photochemical and electrochemical
properties of all of the cationic dyes studied in this work, which
are summarized in the Appendix.

Experimental
Section
General Information
All dyes were purchased from chemical
suppliers (Sigma-Aldrich, Alfa Aesar, TCI America, Fisher Scientific)
and used without further purification. meso-1,2-Dibromo-1,2-diphenylethane
and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl ethylenediamine (TMEDA) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and Acros Organics, respectively, and used as received.
All reactions were irradiated with two 90 W warm-white LEDs purchased
from LedEngin unless otherwise noted. (See the SI for the power spectrum.) Flash column chromatography was
performed using 230–400 mesh silica gel. All 1H
and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 400
spectrometer. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in ppm from the
solvent resonance as the internal standard (CDCl3: δ
7.26 ppm).

General Procedure for the Dehalogenation
of meso-1,2-Dibromo-1,2-diphenylethane
An
oven-dried 10 mL Schlenk
tube was charged with meso-1,2-dibromo-1,2-diphenylethane
(0.3 mmol, 102 mg) and a photosensitizer (0.003 mmol). The contents
were dissolved in 5 mL of dry DMF, followed by the addition of TMEDA
(0.6 mmol, 90 μL). (meso-1,2-Dibromo-1,2-diphenylethane
is sparingly soluble in DMF; however, as the reaction proceeds, it
becomes fully homogeneous.) The reaction was purged with argon for
15 min, followed by 5 min of irradiation with two warm-white LEDs.
The reaction mixture was extracted with ether (three times) and washed
with brine (five times). The organic phase was dried with MgSO4 and concentrated via rotary evaporation. Percent conversions
were determined by 1H NMR analysis.

General Procedure for Aza-Henry
Reactions
An oven-dried
10 mL Schlenk flask was charged with 2-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrosisoquinoline
(0.3 mmol, 63 mg) and a photosensitizer (0.003 mmol). The contents
were dissolved in 5 mL of a 4:1 mixture of MeCN/MeNO2.
The reaction was then irradiated for 1 h with two warm-white LEDs
and diluted with ether (20 mL) and H2O (20 mL). The aqueous
phase was extracted with ether (two times), and the combined organic
phases were washed with brine, dried with MgSO4, and concentrated
by rotary evaporation. All yields are reported as isolated yields.

General Procedure for Laser Flash Photolysis Experiments
The triplet quenching experiments were performed using either a Nd:YAG
laser (532) or a Surelite plus OPO (450–700 nm) in a LFP-111
laser flash photolysis sytem (Luzchem Research Inc., Ottawa, Canada)
and 1 × 1 cm2 quartz cuvettes. Samples were prepared
with a total volume of 3 mL and an absorbance of 0.1 at the excitation
wavelength.

General Procedure for Steady-State Quenching
Experiments
The fluorescence emission measurements required
for the singlet quenching
experiments were carried out in a Photon Technology International
(PTI) spectrofluorimeter at room temperature using 1 × 1 cm2 quartz cuvettes. The fluorescence lifetime was measured in
an Easy-Life (PTI) system and calculated using integrated Easy-Life
software. Samples were prepared with a final absorbance of 0.1 at
the excitation wavelength. The substrates used in the quenching studies
were also prepared in this solution to ensure that the observed quenching
is not due to dilution of the fluorophore.

Results and Discussion
Dehalogenation
of meso-1,2-Dibromo-1,2-diphenylethane
The
dehalogenation of vicinal dibromo compounds employing photoredox
techniques has been extensively studied in the literature, including
examples from the Willner and Rieser groups employing Ru(bpy)3Cl2 as the photosensitizer21,23 and more recently our own group employing α-sexithiophene.24 Because of the analytical simplicity of this
reaction, we decided that it would be an ideal system to test the
efficiency of our cationic organic dyes, and it also allowed for kinetic
measurements to be performed with ease.

We began by examining
the dehalogenation of meso-1,2-dibromo-1,2-diphenylethane
under visible-light irradiation by employing methylene blue as the
photosensitizer. After only 1 h of irradiation, we could observe nearly
quantitative conversion to the dehalogenated product, trans-stilbene (SI). To compare the photocatalytic
efficiency of methylene blue with other cationic dyes, a time point
was required in order to compare the initial reaction efficiencies
of the dyes. We found that decreasing the irradiation time to only
5 min was enough to decrease the conversion of the dibromo compound
to 66%. It is important to note here that in these cases only the
trans isomer of stilbene was observed under short periods of irradiation
time.

The reaction mechanism for this transformation is shown
in Scheme 1. Upon excitation
with visible light, the photosensitizer’s excited state is
generated (either singlet or triplet depending on the photosensitizer
studied), which can be quenched by an amine, in our case TMEDA, generating
the reduced form of the dye and an amine radical cation. The amine
radical cation will be in equilibrium with its deprotonated form,
the α-amino radical, which along with the reduced form of the
dye can reduce the dibromo compound.24,25 Consistent
with this mechanism, control experiments in which the photosensitizer
or visible light is omitted do not produce any conversion. Importantly,
experiments performed under UV irradiation in the prescence of TMEDA
but in the absence of a photosensitizer efficiently dehalogenate the
dibromo compound. This is consistent with the proposed chain mechanism
in Scheme 1 in which
a liberated Br· produced in the reduction of meso-1,2-dibromo-1,2-diphenylethane can abstract a hydrogen from the
amine to yield an α-amino radical, which can in turn propagate
the chain (SI).24,26,27

Scheme 1 Proposed Catalytic Cycle and Chain Reaction
for the Reductive Dehalogenation
of meso-1,2-Dibromo-1,2-diphenylethane Using Cationic
Organic Photosensitizers
We then proceeded to test a variety of cationic organic
photosensitizers
(Table 1) whose detailed
photophysical and electrochemical properties can be found in the Appendix. Importantly, we also obtained the bimolecular
quenching constant (kq) for each cationic
organic dye with TMEDA, the sacrificial electron donor. As demonstrated
in Table 1, the overall
efficiency of the reaction correlates well with the magnitude of the
bimolecular quenching constant, indicating the importance that the
kinetics of this electron-transfer step plays in the overall mechanism.
One exception is the reactivity of 9-mesityl-10-methyl acridinium
perchlorate, which should be among the most reactive photosensitizers
based on the kinetic data listed in Table 1. It is possible, however,
that this is a thermodynamic issue because the reduction potential
of 9-mesityl-10-methyl acridinium perchlorate (−0.49 V vs SCE)
is not sufficiently negative to reduce meso-1,2-dibromo-1,2-diphenylethane
(−1.10 V vs SCE).20,28 The xanthene and oxazine
dyes are also less active than their initial bimolecular quenching
constants would suggest because of their short singlet-state lifetimes
(ns time scales), which greatly decreases the probability of electron
-transfer events compared to those for thiazine and azine dyes with
longer triplet-state lifetimes (μs time scales). This demonstrates
the importance of using triplet photosensitizers to increase the probability
of the excited state interacting with a quencher before relaxing back
to the ground state, and this will be expanded on further vide infra.
It is also important to note here that the kq value observed for rhodamine B is greater than the diffusion
control limit of DMF, which can be attributed to static quenching
due to ground-state complexation with TMEDA. Once again, it is important
to note that the trans isomer was the only isomer observed for all
examples.

Table 1 Reductive Dehalogenation of meso-1,2-Dibromo-1,2-diphenylethane Using Cationic Organic
Dyes
We also examined the reductive
dehalogenation of our model vicinal
dibromo compound employing Ru(bpy)3Cl2 and fac-Ir(ppy)3, two ubiquitous complexes employed
in the field of photoredox catalysis. Although both complexes performed
well under the standard employed conditions, we were surprised to
observe both the cis and trans isomers of stilbene (Scheme 2A). However, by examining the
kinetics of the system for the Ru(bpy)3Cl2 example,
we have determined that the loss in selectivity stems from the unfavorable
kinetics of the initial electron-transfer step. As shown in Scheme 2B, the bimolecular
quenching constant for trans-stilbene and Ru(bpy)3Cl2 is 2 orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding
bimolecular quenching constant with TMEDA, the sacrificial electron
donor. Therefore, any trans-stilbene formed is able
to outcompete TMEDA in the quenching of 3Ru(bpy)3Cl2, resulting in energy transfer and isomerization around
the double bond. In good agreement with this, irradiating trans-stilbene in the presence of either Ru(bpy)3Cl2 or fac-Ir(ppy)3 results
in the same E/Z ratio observed in the reductive dehalogenation experiments
(SI).

Employing Ru(bpy)3Cl2 and fac-Ir(ppy)3 as the
Photosensitizer and (B) Bimolecular Quenching Constants for the Ru(bpy)3Cl2-Catalyzed Reaction
Aza-Henry Reaction
The visible-light-mediated Aza-Henry
reaction of 2-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (PhTHIQ) with
nitromethane (MeNO2) as the nucleophile was first studied
by Stephenson and co-workers in 2010 and since has become one of the
most studied reactions in the field of photoredox catalysis (Scheme 3).22,29 In fact, this reaction has become one of the gold standards when
testing the activity of newly developed photocatalysts.30−36 Because of the popularity of the reaction and the availability of
in-depth mechanistic studies,37 we decided
it would be another excellent test reaction for the cationic dyes
employed in this study. Moreover, the simplicity of the reaction greatly
facilitates the kinetic analysis of our catalytic systems, allowing
us to examine any possible correlations between the xcited-state quenching
efficiency and the overall efficiency of the reaction. Because the
only quenchers in our system are PhTHIQ and molecular oxygen, by measuring
the bimolecular quenching constants of both, we can calculate the
probability at which the excited state of the photocatalyst will be
quenched by PhTHIQ. The corresponding bimolecular quenching constants
can be found in the Appendix.

Scheme 3 Proposed
Mechanism for the Visible-Light-Mediated Aza-Henry Reaction
Note that reactions of 1O2 are viable only for examples in which triplet-state
dyes are employed.

The results for the Aza-Henry
photocatalyzed reaction are summarized
in Table 2. Here, the
difference is more pronounced between the triplet- and singlet-state
dyes, highlighting the importance of selecting a photocatalyst with
a long excited-state lifetime. Once again, 9-mesityl-10-acridinium
perchlorate was shown to be much less efficient than the high bimolecular
quenching constant would suggest, which we attribute to the lack of
reactivity of the intermediate acridinium radical toward molecular
oxygen (E1/2 = −0.8 V vs SCE),38 the required step for catalytic turnover. Control
experiments were also performed with methylene blue as the photocatalyst,
and it was demonstrated that the reaction did not proceed in the absence
of O2, consistent with the previously reported mechanisms
(SI). More specifically, it has been proposed
that either singlet oxygen (1O2) or superoxide
(O2•–) plays a prominent role
in the overall mechanism (Scheme 3),22,37 and upon addition of 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran
(DPBF), an efficient 1O2 and O2•– quencher,39,40 the reactivity
is substantially diminished, consistent with the proposed mechanism
of previous reports (SI). Laser flash photolysis
studies confirmed that the diminished reactivity does indeed arise
from the quenching of the reactive oxygen species by DPBF and not
from the quenching of 3MB by DPBF.

Table 2 Light-Mediated
Aza-Henry Reaction
of 2-Phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline with MeNO2 Using
a Cationic Organic Dye
With all of the kinetic data in hand, we can employ eq 1 to determine the probability
that
the excited state of the dye (*PC) reacts with PhTHIQ under our initial
reaction conditions. 1  

This calculation
was performed with all 13 cationic dyes that were
examined in this study, and the results were plotted against the yield
of the corresponding Aza-Henry reaction (Figure 2). Although the correlation is not strong,
this plot still demonstrates that a majority of the more efficient
reactions are for the larger probabilities of excited-state quenching.
It is also important to note that the highest probabilities for *PC
quenching by PhTHIQ occur when triplet-state dyes (blue • and
green ■) are employed, which one would predict considering
the effect that the excited-state lifetime plays in eq 1. Furthermore, the rate-limiting
step of this reaction is the addition of MeNO2 and not
the initial excited-state electron transfer to the amine, which could
affect the correlation observed in Figure 2.22,37 However, it is still
clear that by optimizing the mechanistically key steps of the system,
even if it is not the rate-limiting step, one can increase the overall
efficiency of the reaction.

Figure 2 Plot of percent yield of the Aza-Henry product
versus the percent
of *dye quenched by PhTHIQ for all cationic dyes examined in this
study. Dye legend: thiazine (blue •), oxazine (red ◊),
xanthene (Δ), and azine (green ■).

We can also perform a similar analysis on the thermodynamic
feasibility
of these reactions. Because the oxidation potential of PhTHIQ is known
(0.90 V vs SCE),41 we can use this value
along with the ground-state reduction potentials and the excited-state
energies of each dye to calculate the Gibbs free energy of photoinduced
electron transfer (ΔGeT) for each
reaction using the following equation: 2  

This calculation
was performed for all 13 cationic dyes examined
in this study, and the results were plotted against the yield of the
Aza-Henry product (Figure 3). We would typically expect that a more negative ΔGeT would lead to a more favorable and therefore
more efficient reaction. However, we essentially see the opposite
trend in Figure 3,
as the more favorable reactions (more negative ΔGeT) give the lowest yields after 2 h of irradiation. Upon
further examination, we can see that the more negative ΔGeT corresponds to the singlet excited-state
dyes (red ◊ and Δ), which can be correlated to their
higher excited-state energies compared to those of the triplet-state
dyes. However, because of their short singlet-state lifetimes, the
probability of electron transfer is greatly decreased, as seen in Figure 2, even though the
electron-transfer event is more favorable. This highlights the importance
of performing kinetics studies because even though a reaction can
have favorable thermodynamics it is ultimately kinetics that determines
to what extent the reaction proceeds.

product versus the Gibbs’
free energy for photoinduced electron transfer (ΔGeT) for all cationic dyes examined in this study. Dye
legend: thiazine (blue •), oxazine (red ◊), xanthene
(Δ), and azine (green ■).

Similar to the reductive dehalogenation reactions, we also
performed
the light-mediated Aza-Henry reaction employing both Ru(bpy)3Cl2 and fac-Ir(ppy)3, which
gave 27 and 26% yields of the final Aza-Henry product, respectively.
One would expect similar results for both photocatalysts because their
rate constants for bimolecular quenching with PhTHIQ are of the same
order of magnitude (2.9 × 107 and 3.1 × 107 M–1s–1 for Ru(bpy)3Cl2 and fac-Ir(ppy)3, respectively).

Conclusions
In this work, we have
demonstrated that cationic dyes can act as
viable metal-free alternatives to transition-metal complexes for visible-light-mediated
photoredox transformations. We have demonstrated the utility of these
dyes in both the reductive dehalogenation of a vicinal dibromo compound
and the visible-light-mediated Aza-Henry reaction of PhTHIQ. In the
majority of these examples, improved kinetics of electron transfer
between the excited state of the photocatalyst and the amine resulted
in an overall increase in the reaction efficiency. This highlights
the importance of optimizing the kinetics of each mechanistically
key step, even if it is not the rate-limiting step of the reaction.

Importantly, we have also provided a summary of all of the photophysical
and electrochemical properties of these cationic dyes, which are readily
available in the Appendix. With this information
in hand, we envision that this will result in an increase in popularity
of these cationic dyes being employed in photoredox processes because
this information will now be readily available to laboratories who
may lack the necessary equipment and/or expertise to perform these
studies.
