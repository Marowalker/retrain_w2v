We describe herein
the design and synthesis of N-phenyl phthalimide
derivatives with inhibitory activities against Plasmodium
falciparum (sensitive and resistant strains)
in the low micromolar range and noticeable selectivity indices against
human cells. The best inhibitor, 4-amino-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)isoindoline-1,3-dione
(10), showed a slow-acting mechanism similar to that
of atovaquone. Enzymatic assay indicated that 10 inhibited P. falciparum cytochrome bc1 complex. Molecular docking studies suggested the binding
mode of the best hit to Qo site of the cytochrome bc1 complex. Our findings suggest that 10 is
a promising candidate for hit-to-lead development.

Introduction
Malaria is a severe
parasitic disease endemic in 91 countries.
According to the WHO, 216 million cases and approximately 445.000
deaths globally were reported in 2016.1 The disease can be caused by five species of Plasmodium spp (Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium
vivax, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium knowlesi). P. falciparum is the major pathogen responsible for deaths, and it is associated
with severe malaria.2 The malaria parasite
has developed a resistance to many of the current drugs, including
emerging P. falciparum resistance to
artemisinin derivatives (1), which is a component of
artemisinin-based combination therapies that comprise the current
first-line therapies.3 In this context,
new safe and affordable antimalarial drugs are desperately needed.
Structure-based approaches have been used to develop new antimalarial
candidates with well-defined mechanisms of action.4−6 The cytochrome bc1 complex contains a coenzyme Q, a cytochrome c reductase, and the ligand ubiquinone. The enzymatic complex
catalyzes electron transfer in the mitochondria of the parasite, which
maintains a stable membrane potential for this organelle.7,8 Atovaquone (2) (Chart 1), a ubiquinone analogue, was approved as a first line
drug for the treatment of malaria in 1992.9 Atovaquone has a well-defined mechanism of action; it binds to the
oxidation site of the cytochrome bc1 enzyme
complex.2,8,10 As a competitive
inhibitor of ubiquinone, the inhibitor blocks cellular respiration
because of the reduction of electron transfer in the mitochondria
of Plasmodium spp, which consequently promotes a collapse in the maintenance
of the mitochondrial membrane potential.10 The ubiquinone binding mode indicates that the molecule interacts
with a P center of the bc1 enzymatic complex,
inducing a conformational change in the Rieske protein at Fe–S
bond, which allows the electron transfer. The atovaquone mode of action
consists of the inhibition of the bc1 complex,
resulting in conformational changes that can affect the electronic
transfer to the cytochrome c.9,11

against Whole Parasite (1) or the bc1 Complex (2–4), and
Their Similarities to 2 Are Highlighted in Red
Recent studies have shown that
the inhibition of the bc1 complex also
affects the electron acceptor enzyme known
as dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). This enzyme plays an important
role in the biosynthesis of pyridines; therefore, inhibiting this
enzymatic complex indirectly impacts the biosynthesis of pyridines
in the parasite as well as the transport of electrons in the mitochondria.9,12

Genetic mutations causing atovaquone resistance have been
described
since the early 1990s.13,14 The replacement of Tyr268 with
serine (Y268S) or asparagine (Y268N) disrupts the chemical interactions
between atovaquone and the active site residues of the bc1 complex. Therefore, the investigation of new inhibitors
is necessary to reduce the potential for drug resistance. Compounds 3 (SL-2-25) and 4 (WR249685) are examples of
atovaquone analogues that are potent bc1 complex inhibitors (Chart 1).15,16

Here, we designed N-phenyl-substituted phthalimides
(5–16) (Scheme 1) as surrogates for the atovaquone core. The approach
consisted of the maintenance of the two aromatic subunits in addition
to the 1,4-naphthoquinone moiety (A) including a para-substituted
phenyl ring (B) with different electronic and steric properties. The
3-hydroxy group on the 1,4-naphthoquinone moiety was replaced with
a monosubstituted amine (C) to maintain the hydrogen-bonding abilities.
Atovaquone has shown better oral bioavailability when the 3-hydroxyl
substituent was replaced with a hydrophobic group (OCH3),11 and a benzyl group (C) was introduced
to investigate its impact on the biological properties. It is worth
mentioning that the designed compounds (5–16)
follow the rule of three for fragment-based drug discovery, that is,
a molecular weight lower than 300 Da, up to three hydrogen bond acceptors
and a calculated log P < 3.17

Phthalimide Fragments

Results and Discussion
In the synthesis of the N-phenyl-substituted phthalimide
derivatives (5–16) (Scheme 2), 3-nitrophalic acid (17) was
refluxed in acetic anhydride for 16 h.18 Then, the nitro group of anhydride 18 underwent catalytic
hydrogenation with Pd/C (3%) resulting in 19.19 In a divergent synthetic step, 3-aminophalic
anhydride (19) was refluxed for 7.5 h in glacial acetic
acid with the appropriate para-substituted aniline (20–25) to afford fragments 5–10.20 Finally, these aminophthalimides (5–10) were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide
with benzyl bromide (26) to form the N-benzylphthalimides (11–16).21 See the Supporting Information for more details regarding the experimental procedures and the characterization
data of the products and intermediates.

Scheme 2 Synthetic Route Used
to Obtain the N-Phenylphthalimides
(5–16)
Compounds 5–16 were evaluated in vitro
against P. falciparum (3D7 strain—chloroquine
sensitive)
by the SYBR green assay.22 The compounds
were tested at single concentration (10 μM), and IC50 values were determined for compounds that showed inhibitions >60%.
Compounds 5–9 and 11–15 were
inactive as they presented IC50Pf values higher than 10 μM (Table 1).

a The presented IC50 values
are the average of two independent experiments. *SI = IC50HepG2/IC50Pf; CI95% = 95%
confidence interval; nd = not determined.

Conversely, compounds 10 and 16 inhibited
in vitro P. falciparum growth at low
micromolar concentrations (IC50Pf values of 4.2 and 6.8 μM, respectively).
These data suggest that a para-methoxy substituent is beneficial for
the inhibitory activity in this series. Moreover, the bulky benzyl
substituent at site C was tolerated, suggesting that structural variation
at this position can be further explored. Next, the cytotoxic effects
of the active compounds were evaluated against a human hepatoma cell
line (HepG2) by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide viability assay.23 Compounds 10 and 16 showed low cytotoxicities (IC50HepG2 > 250
μM)
and considerable selectivity indices (SI values of >36 and >59,
respectively)
(Table 1). It is worth
mentioning that both compounds were soluble at the highest concentration
tested (250 μM).

To better characterize the antiplasmodial
activities and confirm
the low cytotoxicities of the series, the most potent phthalimide
derivative (10) was selected. The morphology of HepG2
cells was evaluated after 24 h of treatment with 250 μM of 10. At this concentration, we verified that compound 10 was not toxic to the cells as they showed a microscopic
morphology similar to that of untreated cells (Figure 1A).

incubation with
10 at 250 μM. Insets: Expansion showing representative cell
morphology; (B) microscopy of synchronized parasites continuously
treated with 10 at 40 μM and the controls [dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), 10, atovaquone, and artesunate]. Representative
images of two independent experiments.

Next, the inhibitory activity of 10 was evaluated
against the P. falciparum K1 strain,
a strain that is multidrug-resistant to the antimalarial drugs chloroquine,
pyrimethamine, and sulfadoxine. Compound 10 was active
in the low micromolar range against the resistant parasite with an
IC50 value of 4.3 μM, which is approximately the
same inhibitory activity observed against the sensitive 3D7 strain
(Figure 2). To elucidate
the stage-specific inhibitory activity of 10, we incubated
the compound with highly synchronized parasites at a concentration
10-fold greater than its IC50 value and observed the morphological
changes over time. As seen in Figure 1B, compound 10 showed activity in the
later ring stages (late rings or early trophozoites) and it induced
alterations in P. falciparum morphology
between 16 and 32 h after incubation. These data suggest a stage-specific
effect that may be related to a slow-acting mechanism in which the
latter forms of P. falciparum in the
intraerythrocytic cycle are susceptible to the effects of the compound.
These results are in good agreement with the stage-specific inhibitory
activity of atovaquone, which is a slow-acting inhibitor of P. falciparum.24

concentration–response curves of 10 against sensitive
(3D7 strain) and resistant parasites (K1 strain).
The reported IC50 values are the mean values of two independent
experiments.

Aiming to elucidate the
effects of compound 10 on P. falciparum mitochondrial respiration, an enzymatic
assay was conducted to measure bc1 complex decylubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity.25 Mitochondrial
fractions were extracted from P. falciparum 3D7 parasites, and the assay was performed using a compound 10 concentration of 70 μM, in parallel with negative
(DMSO) and positive (atovaquone at 6 μM) controls. Our results
showed that 10 inhibited cytochrome bc1 enzymatic activity (74% at 70 μM) and demonstrated that cytochrome bc1 complex is a molecular target of 10 antiplasmodial
activity (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Inhibition

(ATV) at 6 μM (84 ± 1% of inhibition) or compound 10 at 70 μM (74 ± 2% of inhibition). DMSO was used
as a negative control (1 ± 3% of inhibition). **p < 0.005 by Mann–Whitney test.

The mode of atovaquone binding to the cytochrome bc1 complex indicated that the carbonyl group
alpha to the
hydroxyl group is important for ligand binding and recognition. In
addition, the hydroxyl group is involved in a salt bridge with the
nitrogen atom of the imidazole moiety of histidine in the Rieske protein.10,11 Finally, hydrophobic interactions and van der Waals forces are important
for stabilizing atovaquone binding. For example, the cyclohexyl subunit
and the 4-chlorophenyl substituent interact with the side chains of
the V146, I269, P271, M139, L275, M295, and F296 residues from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytochrome bc1 complex.26 Accordingly, on
the basis of the structural similarities and in vitro cellular findings,
which indicated that phthalimide derivative 10 shares
a slow-acting inhibitory mechanism with atovaquone, we modeled the
binding mode of 10 to the cytochrome bc1 complex.

The crystal structure of the S. cerevisiae cytochrome bc1 complex co-crystallized
with stigmatellin was solved at 1.9 Å resolution (PDB ID: 3CX5)27 and has been used as a molecular target for modeling studies.
The observed binding mode of atovaquone co-crystalized with a cytochrome bc1 complex (PDB ID: 4PD4, resolution: 3.04 Å)26 was used as a reference. Superposition of the
two crystal structures showed no significant differences in the orientation
of the amino acid residues within the protein binding sites, suggesting
that the higher resolution structure is adequate for docking studies.
The cytochrome bc1 complex from S. cerevisiae was prepared for rigid docking using
GOLD software (v5.4).28 The hydrogen atoms
were added to the structure, and the water molecules and ligands were
removed. The 3D structure of the hydroxyl group of atovaquone was
built in the ionized state because previous studies showed that this
microspecies is responsible for the activity.26

To evaluate the accuracy of the method, including the ChemPLP
scoring
function,29 we redocked atovaquone into
the cytochrome bc1 complex binding site.
The best-ranked binding mode was compared to the binding mode of atovaquone
in the crystal structure, and both the orientation and interactions
with key residues were reproduced (RMSD = 0.4 Å; PLPscore = 63.3),
which confirms the accuracy of this strategy for the system under
investigation (see the Supporting Information for details). On the basis of that, we used the validated protocol
to predict the binding mode of 10 within the cytochrome bc1 complex binding site. According to the model,
the phthalimidic moiety of 10 establishes hydrogen-bonding
interactions with the side chains of E272 and H181. Additionally,
this moiety is in close contact with the side chains of I147, V146,
and P271 and with the backbone atoms of W142. The methoxyphenyl substituent
forms hydrophobic interactions with the side-chain atoms of M295 and
L275. The ChemPLP score for this pose is 63.6, which is close to the
calculated score for the atovaquone binding mode (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Docking pose of 10 (orange stick) in the binding site
of the S. cerevisiae cytochrome bc1 complex (PDB ID 3CX5). Main interacting residues are indicated
as green sticks. Hydrogen bonds are represented as yellow dotted lines.
Residues I269, V270, P271, E272, L275, Y279, and M295 (black label)
are located at the cytochrome b subunit, whereas
H181 (red label) is located at the Rieske protein subunit. Residues
W142, V146, I147, and all hydrogens atoms were omitted for clarity.
Figure generated using PyMol (v 0.99).30

As highlighted in the sequence
alignment (Figure S52),31,32 all of the mentioned residues
interacting with the phthalimidic moiety are conserved in the P. falciparum cytochrome bc1 complex (Uniprot Q02768/Q8IL75), apart from M295 and L275. Residues
M295 and L275 from bc1 of S. cerevisiae are replaced with V284 and F264, respectively.
In P. falciparum, both substitutions
can establish hydrophobic interactions with the methoxyphenyl substituent
of 10. Moreover, the alignment of S. cerevisiae, P. falciparum, and Mycobacterium tuberculosisbc1 sequences shows that the binding site of 10 is
conserved within these species. The residues H181, I269, and P271
from bc1 complex of S.
cerevisiae are conserved in P. falciparum and M. tuberculosis, whereas V146
and I147, conserved in P. falciparum, are conservative replaced by alanine and leucine, respectively,
in M. tuberculosis. Most of nonconserved
residues within the three species stabilizes compound 10 by hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions. Because a potent
antimycobacterial activity is observed for phthalimide-containing
compounds whose target is the bc1 complex
of M. tuberculosis,33 the binding site identity is an indicative that the bc1 complex might be the molecular target of
compound 10.

Conclusions
Phthalimide-based derivatives
are attractive molecules for drug
discovery and development. Because of the potential biological activity
and pharmaceutical use, the privileged phthalimide scaffold was designed
to be used in many therapeutic treatments, including antituberculosis
as cytochrome bc1 inhibitor,33 anti-inflammatory compound developed as a phosphodiesterase-4
inhibitor34 and for antimalarial as plasmepsin
II & IV inhibitor.35 In this work,
the best phthalimide derivative, compound 10, exhibited
antimalarial activity against sensitive and resistant P. falciparum strains in the low micromolar range
(IC50 < 10 μM), no cytotoxicity against HepG2
cells, a considerable selectivity index (SI > 30), and a slow-acting
mechanism, which is consistent with the inhibitory stage of action
of atovaquone. The modeled binding mode of 10 suggested
the molecular determinants that might be related to the inhibitory
activity of this series. Therefore, our findings indicate that 4-amino-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)isoindoline-1,3-dione
(10) is a new hit for the development of lead compounds
with superior properties.

Computational Methods
Initially,
all molecular structures of the p-phenyl-functionalized
phthalimidic compounds were generated with Discovery Studio Visualizer
free software (DSV/version: 17.2.0)36 and
were optimized using the semiempirical method PM6 in MOPAC free software
(version 2016)37 through the Mercury CSD
software interface (v3.9), which is included in the CCDC GOLD Suite
computational package. The commands used during optimization were:
MMOK, XYZ, CHARGE = −1 [for docking of atovaquone (2)] and GNORM = 1. The format of the optimized compound file was *.mol2.
Atovaquone, the reference ligand for this work, was modeled in the
ionized state.26 In parallel, the 3D file
(*.pdb) of the S. cerevisiae cytochrome bc1 crystal structure in complex with stigmatellin
was obtained from Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 3CX5) at 1.9 Å resolution.27 The structure was chosen because atovaquone
is a high affinity inhibitor of S. cerevisiae complex III (Ki = 5 nM), a nonpathogenic
surrogate model for studying biological activities of compounds that
target the parasite through this mechanism. Although the crystal structure
contains a ligand other than atovaquone, we chose it because the cytochrome bc1 crystal structure in complex with atovaquone
(PDB ID: 4PD4)26 lacks the Rieske protein and has lower
resolution in comparison with the 3CX5 structure. Superposition of 3CX5 and 4PD4 indicates no significant
differences in the position of the atoms in amino acid residues of
the binding site, thereby suggesting that the structure is suitable
for the docking calculations using atovaquone’s binding mode
in 4PD4 as a
reference for evaluation of the model. The 3CX5.pdb file was then prepared for docking
using GOLD software (v5.4),28 where the
hydrogen atoms were added to the structure. All water molecules and
ligands were removed. The rigid docking was performed in GOLD using
coordinates x = 13.0858, y = 5.3280,
and z = 17.4635 as the center of a 10 Å search
radius. GOLD was set to consider possible ligand internal hydrogen
bonds in the calculations and score 50 binding modes using the ChemPLP
scoring function. The selection of this scoring function was based
on a previous article by Li et al. that indicates best accuracy for
ChemPLP in comparison with several other score functions.29 The best GOLD docking results for each ligand
were analyzed using Discovery Studio Visualizer free software to check
the ligand–cytochrome bc1 complex
interaction types. The figures were generated in Pymol (v0.99).30
