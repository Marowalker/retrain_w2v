Atomic
layer deposition (ALD) of Ni was demonstrated by introducing
a novel oxygen-free heteroleptic Ni precursor, (η3-cyclohexenyl)(η5-cyclopentadienyl)nickel(II) [Ni(Chex)(Cp)].
For this process, non-oxygen-containing reactants (NH3 and
H2 molecules) were used within a deposition temperature
range of 320–340 °C. Typical ALD growth behavior was confirmed
at 340 °C with a self-limiting growth rate of 1.1 Å/cycle.
Furthermore, a postannealing process was carried out in a H2 ambient environment to improve the quality of the as-deposited Ni
film. As a result, a high-quality Ni film with a substantially low
resistivity (44.9 μΩcm) was obtained, owing to the high
purity and excellent crystallinity. Finally, this Ni ALD process was
also performed on a graphene surface. Selective deposition of Ni on
defects of graphene was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy
and atomic force microscopy analyses with a low growth rate (∼0.27
Å/cycle). This unique method can be further used to fabricate
two-dimensional functional materials for several potential applications.

1 Introduction
Ni
and Ni-based compounds have attracted considerable attention
toward several potential applications owing to their favorable electrical
and catalytic properties. For example, they have been widely used
as electrocatalysts in energy applications,1 and NiSi has many advantages for reducing the dimensions of complementary
metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) devices.2,3 Among the various preparation techniques for Ni, atomic layer deposition
(ALD) is a promising process in nanotechnology, owing to its outstanding
conformality, uniformity, and pinhole-free thin-film deposition.4,5 The self-limited surface reaction, which is the basic principle
of ALD, allows precise control of the film thickness and stoichiometry
at the atomic level. Accordingly, ALD has been considered as a key
process for fabricating nanoscale devices.4−6 However, Ni
ALD technology has not yet matured despite the increasing demand for
its potential applications. More specifically, as shown by the standard
reduction potentials in Table S1 in the
Supporting Information, the reduction of Ni is more difficult than
that of noble metals such as Ru and Pt. This fact indicates that Ni
bonds more strongly to electronegative elements such as oxygen. This
high oxygen affinity is a limiting factor that has restricted the
development of Ni ALD as NiOx is easily
formed during or after the ALD process. Moreover, this behavior restricts
the reactants of Ni ALD to oxygen-free molecules,7−18 whereas oxygen-containing reactants (e.g., O2 and O3) are widely used in ALD of noble metals.19 The development of Ni precursors is also challenging, and
only a limited number of them have been developed so far.20,21 Processes using bis(dimethylamino-2-methyl-2-butoxo)nickel [Ni(dmamb)2]7−9 showed the typical deposition behavior of the self-limited
reaction and produced Ni films with low resistivities. However, a
considerable amount of impurities such as C,7,8 N,8 and O9 remained in
the films after the ALD process. The C impurities issue was also reported
in the process using N2-hydroxyhexafluoroisopropyl-N1 Ni precursor [Ni(hfip)2].10 Further processes using bis(1-(tert-butylimino)-2,3-dimethylbutan-2-olate)nickel [Ni(iPrMeCOCNtBu)2]11 or bis(2,4-pentanedionato)nickel
[Ni(acac)2]22 have also been
reported, but the growth rates obtained for these cases (0.09 Å/cycle11 and 0.07 Å/cycle22) were significantly low. In addition, a large quantity of C impurities
was evident in the films when Ni(acac)2 was used as the
Ni precursor.22 Recently, Ni(acac)2 was modified to Ni(acac)2(tmeda) (tmeda: tetramethyl
ethylenediamine), and a Ni ALD process using Ni(acac)2(tmeda)
showed enhanced reactivity of the precursor.18

All of the Ni precursors mentioned above contain O, which
has a
certain possibility of forming an oxide phase with Ni or remaining
as an impurity in the as-deposited films. In this regard, bis(N,N′-diisopropylacetamidinato)nickel
[Ni(AMD(iPr)2)2]12 and bis(cyclopentadienyl)nickel [Ni(Cp)2],13−16 as O-free Ni precursors, have been studied for Ni deposition. The
process using Ni(AMD(iPr)2)2 showed a low growth
rate (0.04 Å/cycle), and any other information was not mentioned
in the study.12 It has also been confirmed
that the reactivity of Ni(Cp)2 is too low to act as a precursor
for thermal ALD. As a result, the Ni ALD process using Ni(Cp)2 requires a highly chemically reactive reactant such as NHx radicals, which are produced by plasma14,15 or hot wire.16 Further, additional processes
such as reduction of NiO13 and postannealing15 were also required to obtain a pure Ni film.
A recent study reported a process involving bis(1,4-di-tert-butyl-1,3-diazadienyl)nickel [Ni(tBu2DAD)2] that produced high-quality Ni films at low process temperatures
(180 °C), but the deposition of the film was only possible on
noble metal substrates (Pt and Ru).17 In
summary, the low reactivity of the precursor and impurities in the
deposited films are the main issues to be solved in the Ni ALD processes. Table 1 provides some key
information of the previous Ni ALD processes. Thus, new Ni precursors
should be designed to have suitable reactivities without impurities
in the deposited films. The precursor should also be compatible with
thermal ALD to prevent sample damage, which might be caused by the
use of plasma or additional processes during postdeposition of the
films.

Herein, we report a new thermal ALD process for depositing Ni thin
films using a novel heteroleptic Ni precursor, namely, (η3-cyclohexenyl)(η5-cyclopentadienyl)nickel(II)
[Ni(Chex)(Cp), C11H14Ni] (Figure 1). We expect the precursor reactivity to
be enhanced by replacing one Cp ring in Ni(Cp)2 with a
cyclohexenyl ring. In general, the Cp ligand ensures thermal stability
of a metal–organic precursor21,23 due to its
coordination (i.e., η5-cyclopentadienyl
metal–organic compound). The strong C–metal bonds improve
the thermal stability of the precursor but also cause a too low reactivity
issue that leads to low growth rate and retained impurities. Therefore,
the substitution of Cp ligands or combination with other chemical
compounds can be a viable alternative for improving the reactivity
of the precursor. In fact, this approach is already found in other
metal ALDs. For example, improvement of the reactivity has been already
confirmed in Ru ALD processes using precursors having other ligands
such as six-membered rings (benzyl- or cyclohexadienyl-type ligands)
or carbonyl ligands.24−26 Comparing Ru(Cp)2,27,28 published research clearly shows a fast growth rate,26 low growth temperature,24,25 and enhanced volatility of the precursor.24−26 Accordingly,
the Ni precursor is also expected to improve the reactivity by the
substitution and combination of the Cp ligand from Ni(Cp)2. Finally, we performed the Ni ALD process on graphene as an application
of Ni ALD, which shows unique deposition behavior. The ideal basal
plane of graphene is chemically stable because it contains no dangling
bonds or functional groups. As a result, materials are deposited selectively
on chemically active regions such as line defects.29 In recent years, graphene composites have been actively
investigated for many applications.30,31 Graphene–metal
composites with metals such as Ru32 and
Pt,33 acquired by selective deposition,
have demonstrated that the electrical properties of graphene are improved.
Hydrogen detector33 applications are also
feasible. The Ni ALD process has not yet been applied to graphene,
although it has been applied to other carbon materials.34,35 Thus, research on Ni ALD on graphene is needed. We applied our Ni
ALD process to single-layer graphene grown by a chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) process. The selective deposition was then systematically investigated
and compared with typical growth processes.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Ni Film
Deposition Using Oxygen, Hydrogen,
and Ammonia Molecules as Reactants
Prior to deposition of
the Ni films by ALD, the thermal stability of the new metal–organic
Ni precursor was verified. For this test, only the Ni precursor was
provided with a N2 carrier gas into the chamber up to a
temperature of 340 °C for 10 min, without introducing any counter-reactants
such as O2, H2, and NH3 like the
pyrolysis process of CVD. Here, the Ni precursor is not trapped in
the chamber but continuously flows from the canister line to the chamber
and exhaust line to the pump, which is the same situation with the
ALD process, except that purging (N2 gas only) and reactant
pulsing are not done. In the current study, the continuous provision
of the precursor was done for 10 min, or 600 s, which corresponds
to 60 ALD cycles considering the precursor pulsing time in one ALD
cycle of the present study. In this case, no film growth was observed,
which indicates that the new Ni precursor is thermally stable up to
340 °C, excluding the possibility of growth by thermal decomposition. Figure 2a shows the X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns of ALD Ni films obtained using H2, NH3, and O2 as reactants at a deposition
temperature of 320 °C. The XRD data indicate that face-centered
cubic (fcc) NiO is formed when O2 is introduced into the
reaction chamber. There are only fcc NiO peaks (indexed by PDF no.
00-047-1049) in the XRD data of the O2 reactants. It can
now be easily realized that an oxygen-free reactant is essential to
deposit pure Ni films by our ALD process. The XRD result also revealed
the high reactivity of the Ni precursor under thermal ALD conditions.
Therefore, two different reducing agents were further tested. By contrast,
an fcc Ni peak (indexed by PDF no.00-004-0850) is observed when NH3 or H2 is used as the reactant. Although the peaks
(44.49° in H2-320 °C and 44.51° in NH3-320 °C) correspond exactly to the Ni(111) peak in the
reference (44.51°, PDF no.00-004-0850), there is no experimental
evidence from our data to completely rule out the interpretation of
the broad peak reported by recent research,36−38 which implies
the coexistence of Ni3C peaks in the Ni(111) peak. This
result further confirms that an oxygen-free reactant is indispensable
for obtaining Ni metal films by ALD. As a consequence, the remainder
of the work related to this study was carried out only with O-free
reactants, unless stated otherwise. Resistivity is another critical
parameter of this Ni ALD process, so we have compared the resistivities
of films deposited under the same condition using NH3 and
H2 as reactants, as shown in Figure 2b. The resistivities of films deposited by
the 320 °C processes were very high (H2-320 °C:
6.83 × 104 μΩcm, NH3-320 °C:
5.23 × 104 μΩcm) and showed different
values depending on the reactants. It was observed that the resistivity
of the Ni film was considerably lower when NH3 was used
rather than H2, so the former has been chosen as a reactant
for various studies on the Ni ALD process.8,9,14−16 In particular, it was
confirmed that NHx species play a key
role in removing Cp from metal ions.14,16,39 Previous research on this phenomenon and the data
at 320 °C compel us to consider NH3 as an optimum
reactant. Therefore, the films were further deposited at another elevated
temperature using the NH3 reactant. As expected, the resistivity
of the sample decreased drastically when increasing the deposition
temperature from 320 to 340 °C. However, the resistivity of this
sample (1.67 × 103 μΩcm) was still significantly
higher than that of bulk Ni (6.93 μΩcm),40 which implies that the film contains a good amount of impurities
probably originating from the precursor and reactant molecules. The
presence of the impurities was therefore confirmed by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Figure 2c–f shows the XPS spectra for the C, N, O, and
Ni orbital electrons as obtained from the films deposited using NH3 at 340 °C. Ion etching (300 s) was performed to avoid
incorporating impurities unintentionally from the surroundings onto
the surfaces of the films. As can be seen in Figure 2c, the signature peak for C 1s with considerable
intensity was evident even after Ar-ion etching (or in the bulk of
the film). The composition of the film was C (17.88 atom %), O (0.42
atom %), and Ni (81.70 atom %). Further deconvolution of these individual
XPS peaks was performed to identify the different chemical bonds of
these impurities with Ni. In the C 1s spectrum,15,32 a peak corresponding to C–Ni (283.6 eV) is observed, but
peaks corresponding to sp2 C–C bonds (284.5 eV)
and sp3 C–C (or C–H) bonds (285.0 eV) from
the ligand of the Ni precursor are also clearly visible. This finding
is interpreted as residual organic ligands remaining in the Ni film
after the ALD process. Similarly, the Ni 2p3/2 (Ni–C
853.6 eV) spectra also show the presence of impurities.15 O and N peaks were not observed in the N 1s
and O 1s spectra. The peak corresponding to metallic Ni bonds in the
Ni 2p3/2 spectrum (852.8 eV) accompanying the satellite
peak (858.8 eV) was also clearly observed.15,16 Thus, the Ni metal film was achieved via a thermal ALD process using
an oxygen-free precursor and reactant, which means that the high oxygen
affinity issue was solved. However, compared to bulk Ni, the resistivities
of the films obtained by Ni ALD are much higher, owing to the presence
of C impurities.

2.2 Growth Behavior during the Ni ALD Process
To determine the self-limiting growth behavior during the Ni ALD
process, we measured the growth rates of the films separately as a
function of the precursor and reactant exposure with increasing pulsing
time at a deposition temperature of 340 °C. It should also be
noted here that, for all of the depositions carried out in the current
work, a purging (of an ultrapure N2 gas) time of 10 s was
fixed, which should provide enough room to remove the by-products
as well as the residual chemicals (precursor and reactant), if any. Figure 3a shows the growth
rate as a function of the precursor pulse time (tNi), while the reactant (NH3) pulsing time
(tNH3) was maintained constant at 5 s.
It can be easily realized that the growth rate was increasing when tNi was continuously increased from 3 to 10 s.
However, there was no further increment in the growth rate beyond
10 s (from 10 to 20 s) of pulsing for the Ni precursor, which clearly
reveals a self-saturation of the film’s growth with increasing
precursor exposure. By contrast, the growth rate remains constant
with increasing tNH3, as shown in Figure 3b, which means that
the growth rate was already saturated after tNH3 of 3 s. These results indicate that the self-limiting reaction
is well validated with a growth rate of 1.1 Å/cycle during the
Ni ALD process. Figure 3c shows the Ni film thickness as a function of the number of ALD
cycles under a self-limiting growth condition. The linear dependence
of the film thickness with ALD cycles further reflects a typical thin-film
growth behavior of this Ni ALD process. The incubation step (i.e.,
the x-intercept of the fitted line) is only six cycles,
which indicates that the growth of the Ni film is initiated without
delay. The obtained growth rate (1.1 Å/cycle) from this thickness
linearity study is also in good agreement with the saturated growth
rates observed during the pulse tests.

2.3 Postannealing of Ni ALD Films
An
annealing process was introduced to improve the quality of the as-deposited
Ni films. This postannealing process was performed under a hydrogen
flux (50 sccm) at ∼0.3 Torr for 30 min. Figure 4a shows the resistivity as a function of
the annealing temperature. The resistivity decreased rapidly with
increasing annealing temperatures at 360–380 °C and reached
less than 100 μΩcm at 380 °C. Finally, the lowest
value (44.9 μΩcm) was obtained by annealing the film at
400 °C; this is comparable with that of previous Ni ALD processes.
This drastic reduction in resistivity can be explained by two factors.
First, the C impurity in the as-deposited film is completely removed
by the annealing process. Figure 4b shows the XPS spectrum of C 1s in the Ni film after
annealing at 380 °C. The C peak observed with significant intensities
in the as-deposited films (Figure 2c) disappears, indicating that a pure Ni film is formed
by the annealing process. Second, the annealing process enhances the
crystallinity of the Ni film. Figure 4c shows the XRD data of the Ni films before and after
the annealing process. In the XRD patterns, only Ni peaks (as discussed
earlier in detail, Figure 2a) are observed, and the shapes of the peaks are sharper as
the annealing temperatures increase. Therefore, the XRD analyses of
the annealed films reveal that the crystallinity improves continuously
with increasing annealing temperatures. The results of the quantitative
analysis of the Ni peaks are further shown in Figure 4d. The grain size (D) as
a function of the annealing temperature was calculated using Scherrer’s
equation, as given by  where k, taken as 0.9 in
this work, is a shape constant, λ (0.154187 nm) is the wavelength
of the incident beam, B is the full width at half-maximum
(FWHM) of the peak, and θ is the Bragg angle. Although uncertainty
in the shape constant and many assumptions of this equation make it
difficult to define a value of grain size correctly,41 the trend obtained for the grain size is well matched with
that of the resistivity. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
shown in Figure 4e
further confirm that the grain size of Ni increases after annealing.
This significant increase in the grain size and removal of the impurities
now clearly explain the drastic decrease in the resistivity of the
Ni ALD films after postannealing. Once the Ni ALD process is established
with detailed investigations of the growth and properties of as-deposited
and annealed films, we move to grow these Ni ALD films on single-layer
graphene while keeping in mind several potential applications of such
composites.

is 300, and τNi is the thickness of the film.

2.4 Selective
Deposition of Ni on Defects of Graphene
The selective deposition
was confirmed by electron microscopy. Figure 5a shows SEM images
of the graphene substrate before and after the Ni ALD process. The
lines on the surface of as-prepared graphene are wrinkles, which are
mainly formed during the transfer process.42 The SEM image of graphene after 200 cycles of Ni ALD clearly shows
that Ni is mostly deposited on the lines, which act as nucleation
sites. Unlike an ideal graphene surface, defects such as holes and
residues are present in the basal plane. These defects also act as
deposition sites. Therefore, Ni islands are observed on the basal
plane of graphene as the number of Ni ALD cycles increases to 500
and 800. Figure 5b
shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of graphene
after 500 cycles of Ni ALD. There are three lines visible on the graphene
surface in Figure 5b, and Ni is selectively deposited on these lines. Figure 5c shows diffraction patterns
(DPs) in various regions seen in Figure 5b. DPs corresponding to three graphene grains
are observed over the entire region (two grains in the green circle
and one grain in the yellow circle). The DPs in each region (named
A, B, and C in Figure 5b) clearly show that the graphene grains in the three regions have
different orientations. Accordingly, the lines in Figure 5b are defined as grain boundaries,
and the selective deposition of Ni is confirmed to occur on both wrinkles
and grain boundaries. Thus, the grain boundaries and several kinds
of defects inside the basal planes promote further growth of Ni on
graphene substrates.

of
graphene before and after Ni ALD. (b) TEM image of graphene after
500 cycles of Ni ALD. (c) Electron diffraction patterns of graphene
for the regions shown in (b); z is the zone axis.
(d) Electron diffraction pattern of fcc Ni and fcc NiO on graphene.
(e) High-resolution TEM images and FFT of islands (selected regions
D and E) on the graphene.

Further, indexing of the diffraction data enabled us to define
the components of the deposited material. Figure 5d shows the DP of the graphene surface, which
reveals the presence of polycrystalline fcc Ni and fcc NiO on the
surface. Figure 5e
shows a high-resolution TEM image and fast Fourier transform (FFT)
of selected areas (D and E). The islands in D and E are defined as
pure fcc Ni and an fcc NiO–Ni mixture, respectively. The presence
of NiO can be interpreted only as the result of exposure to a small
number of oxygen molecules in the chamber or air after the ALD process
because no oxygen components (in the Ni precursor, reactant, and purging
gas) are involved in the current ALD process.

Atomic force microscopy
(AFM) analyses more clearly show the tendency
of selective deposition according to the number of Ni ALD cycles and
provide quantitative information. Figure 6a shows the AFM images of graphene before
and after the Ni ALD process, and these are in good agreement with
our earlier SEM analyses of these films. The contrast of lines on
the graphene surface becomes more apparent as the number of Ni ALD
cycles increases, indicating that the heights of the lines increase.
This result confirms that the line defects act as deposition sites,
and the growth of Ni preferentially proceeds along these lines. The
surface morphology is a key factor in determining the quality of the
interface between graphene and other materials in device applications.43,44 The surface root mean square (RMS) roughness of the graphene substrate
presented in Figure 6b shows that the flatness of graphene is maintained even after the
formation of numerous Ni lines and islands. Although the RMS roughness
increases with increasing Ni ALD cycles, the graphene maintains almost
a flat structure as the roughness is restricted within 5 nm.

AFM images of graphene before and after Ni ALD. (b) Surface RMS roughness
of graphene and (c) average height of the lines as a function of the
number of ALD cycles.

Typically, it is difficult to evaluate the conventional growth
rate of ALD processes on pristine graphene because selective deposition
inhibits the formation of a film. Inevitably, a general qualitative
description of the deposition behavior is provided, with the conclusion
that the deposition is suppressed by the selective deposition.32,33 However, the growth rate can be estimated by only observing morphological
changes in the region where the material is deposited. Thus, a line
profile analysis was performed on the Ni deposited lines. Figure 6c shows the average
heights of the lines as a function of the number of Ni ALD cycles
in the region shown in Figure 6a. The height is defined as the average of the height of each
line, as measured in the line profile at several arbitrary points
on the graphene surface. The details are shown in Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information. The changes
in the line height clearly show the two steps of Ni growth. There
is no remarkable change in the height over the first 200 cycles, whereas
a Ni film was already formed on the SiO2 substrate after
200 cycles of Ni ALD, as shown in Figure 3c. Therefore, the process up to 200 cycles
is considered an incubation step in which Ni nuclei form on the line
defects. This long incubation step indicates that nucleation by adsorption
of the Ni precursor and the subsequent chemical reaction progress
very slowly on the graphene defects. However, substantive Ni growth
was achieved after 200 cycles of Ni ALD. In the growth step, the height
increases almost linearly to 9.6 nm after 500 cycles and 18 nm after
800 cycles. The slope of the fitted line is 0.27 Å/cycle, which
corresponds to the growth rate of Ni on graphene defects. The growth
rate on graphene, which was estimated by excluding the incubation
step, is smaller than that (1.1 Å/cycle) on SiO2.
Nevertheless, a few nanometers of Ni ALD on a graphene sheet could
be well expected to alter (or enhance) the optoelectronic and catalytic
properties when compared to pristine graphene. For example, our Ni
ALD process enables the high optical transmittance (T) of graphene to be maintained when Ni is deposited on defects of
graphene. Figure S3 in the Supporting Information
shows the T of graphene after Ni ALD. The T of graphene is higher than that of the glass substrate
and is maintained at above 90% up to 500 cycles.

3 Conclusions
A new thermal ALD process for depositing Ni
thin films was developed
using a novel heteroleptic Ni precursor, Ni(Chex)(Cp), and NH3 as a reactant. Oxygen was excluded as a reactant, owing to
the formation of NiO, whereas an oxygen-free Ni film was obtained
when non-oxygen-based reactants (H2 and NH3)
were used during the ALD process. However, the lowest resistivity
achieved for the as-deposited film was obtained for the NH3 reactant at a growth temperature of 340 °C. The self-limiting
surface reaction was also confirmed by varying the exposure of both
the precursor and reactant. As a result, the self-limited growth rate
of 1.1 Å/cycle was obtained for Ni ALD on the SiO2 substrate. An annealing process improved the quality of the as-deposited
film by removing impurities and increasing the crystallinity of the
film. Thus, low resistivity (44.9 μΩcm) was demonstrated
by thermal ALD with a postannealing process. Graphene substrates exhibit
distinctive deposition behavior, and Ni was selectively deposited
on the chemically active sites of graphene such as wrinkles and grain
boundaries. A relatively lower growth rate (0.27 Å/cycle) on
defects of graphene indicates that the overall growth of Ni was slowed
down. Consequently, the graphene maintained a flat structure after
the ALD process, which may provide applicability as a two-dimensional
functional material.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Ni ALD and Annealing
The Ni precursor
[Ni(Chex)(Cp)] was developed as a prototype product of Tanaka Kikinzoku
Kogyo K.K. (Japan). Ni thin films were deposited in a traveling wave-type
ALD reactor (Lucida-D100, NCD Technology) using the precursor as a
Ni source and various reactants (O2, H2, and
NH3) within deposition temperatures of 320–340 °C.
Ni(Chex)(Cp) is a liquid precursor (melting temperature: ∼24
°C) and has a vapor pressure of ∼1 Torr at 85 °C.
The precursor was vaporized in a bubbler maintained at 50 °C
and carried by a N2 gas with a flow rate of 50 sccm (standard
cubic centimeters per minute). N2 gas (100 sccm) was also
flowed during the purge steps between the precursor (reactant) pulse
and reactant (precursor) pulse to remove the reaction by-products
and residual precursor/reactant, if any. The purge time was fixed
at 10 s, and the working pressure of the reactor chamber was maintained
at ∼1 Torr during all of the reactions. A SiO2 (100
nm)/Si substrate was used for Ni deposition. The postannealing process
was performed in a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) chamber under a hydrogen
atmosphere (with a flow rate of 50 sccm) and at ∼0.3 Torr for
30 min.

4.2 Graphene Synthesis and Transfer Process
Single-layer graphene was synthesized on Cu through a CVD process.
The first growth step was performed under a source gas flux (0.5 sccm
CH4, 12 sccm H2, and 50 sccm Ar). In the second
growth step, to synthesize fully covered graphene, the flow of CH4 was increased to 1 sccm. The process time for each step was
30 min, and the growth temperature was 1030 °C. Graphene transfer
was achieved using a typical wet chemical transfer process45 whereby polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) was first
spin-coated onto the as-grown graphene. PMMA/graphene/Cu was then
floated on a solution of 0.1 M ammonium persulfate overnight to etch
the Cu. The remaining PMMA/graphene layers were then scooped onto
a Si/SiO2 (285 nm) substrate. The residual PMMA was then
removed by an annealing process (380 °C, in ambient air, 1 atm).
Other details of the synthesis and transfer are the same as previously
reported.32

4.3 Characterizations
XRD patterns were
collected using an X’Pert MRD diffractometer (PANalytical)
used for identification of materials and crystallinity. SEM analyses
using an S-4800 system (Hitachi High Technologies) were performed
to observe surface morphologies and measure the thicknesses of Ni
films. The resistivities of the Ni films were measured using a four-point
probe. Graphene was transferred onto a 20 nm-thick Si3N4 membrane using the transfer process described above, and
then TEM analyses were conducted using a JEM-2100F system (JEOL).
SEM images of graphene were acquired with a SUPRA 55VP field-emission
scanning electron microscope (Carl Zeiss). AFM images were obtained
using an NX-10 system (Park Systems). The XPS data were collected
using an AXIS-HIS spectrometer (Kratos Inc.) with an X-ray source
(Mg Kα, source energy: 1.254 keV, pass energy: 20 eV, step size:
0.1 eV) at a chamber base pressure of 5 × 10–10 bar. Spectra were recorded using a five-channel detector with a
hemispherical analyzer (radius: 127 mm). An XPS software package (casa
XPS, fitting method: a combination of Gaussian and Lorentzian GL(30))
was used to collect and quantify the data. Sputtering was performed
using an argon sputter gun positioned at a 45° angle from the
substrate normal. The Ni film was sputtered with Ar ions of 2 keV.
During the XPS analysis of the Ni films, Ar-ion etching (300 s) was
first performed to exclude surface contamination and to remove native
metal oxides, which could be formed by exposure to air.
