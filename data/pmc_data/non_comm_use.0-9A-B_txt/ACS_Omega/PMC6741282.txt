We
investigated the usefulness of the dried Dowex H+/NaI approach
for the selective di-iodination of alkynes. The Dowex
H+/NaI approach selectively produces only (E)-di-iodinated products; it is very straightforward and nontoxic.
The utilization of 2-propanol as a solvent in the reactions can be
considered as a “green” approach and the method maybe
extended to radio-iodination. The method allows access to highly important
building blocks. An initial example of the di-iodination and esterification
in the same one-pot reaction is also presented.

Introduction
In recent decades,
environmental issues have become one of the
major questions to be tackled by industrial synthetic chemistry. The
need to reduce the production of waste and the use of hazardous and
toxic substances have stimulated a new way of thinking, so-called
green chemistry. Green chemistry focuses on the design of processes
that minimize and/or eliminate the use and the generation of hazardous
substances while producing more environmentally friendly products.1,2

As is generally known, perhaps the most traditional method
for
di-iodination is to use elemental I2 as the source of iodine.
However, if elevated temperatures are need, I2 may not
be practical because it sublimes so readily. Common methods for di-iodination
reported in the literature consist of the use of hazardous and/or
toxic compounds, such as oxidants, e.g., H2O2,3 iodine sources, e.g., trimethylsulfonium
iodate4 and iodine monochloride,5 reagents like tetrafluoroboric acid6 and solvents, e.g., dichloromethane,5 dioxane,6 or tetrahydrofuran.3 Some procedures also use heavy-metal catalysts,
like copper7 or cobalt.8

Iodinated compounds are indispensable building blocks
in organic
chemistry; they are extensively used in the creation of new covalent
bonds, e.g., C–C,9,10 C–N,11−13 C–O,14,15 C–B,16,17 C–S,18,19 and C–metal20,21 bonds. Iodinated compounds can also be used as intermediates in
the production of deuterium-labeled compounds.22 For example, α,β-diiodo alkenes have been used
as building blocks while synthesizing a diverse group of compounds,
e.g., substituted alkynes,23,24 oxygen heterocycles,25 carboxylic esters,26 β-iodo alkenyl sulfides,27 thiazoles,28 oxazoles,29 furans,30 and tetracenes.31 Additionally, iodination is crucial in isotope labeling, as it serves
as a way to achieve radio-iodination, which is necessary for positron
emission tomography and single-photon-emission computed tomography
imaging, cancer therapies, and diagnostics; most common radio-iodine
source, e.g., for 125I labeling, is [125I ]NaI
(sodium iodide).32

In our laboratory,
we have demonstrated that an oven-dried Dowex
H+ ion-exchange resin can be a versatile and highly efficient
tool in organic syntheses. In general, it is a regenerable, reusable,
and easy-to-handle solid material that can be used for the synthesis
of tertiary iodides, ethers, and esters; it can also be utilized in
the transesterification of triglycerides to produce biodiesel, all
of which we have reported earlier in our “proof-of-concept”
paper.33 Furthermore, we have evaluated
the dried Dowex H+/NaX (X = Br, I) approach more systematically
for its ability to achieve ring openings of cyclic ethers to produce
useful building blocks;34 more recently,
we have reported a green and efficient esterification method based
on the catalysis with the dried Dowex H+/NaI method35 (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Green and Efficient Esterification and Oxygen-Containing
Ring-Opening
Reactions Reported Elsewhere Using the Dried Dowex H+/NaX
(X = I, Br) Approach
In the paper, we report
a novel and simple one-pot reaction for
the stereoselective di-iodination of alkynes using stable, nontoxic,
and cheap sodium iodide (NaI) as an iodine source and “green”
2-propanol as the solvent by adopting the Dowex H+/NaI
approach.

Results and Discussion
The general method and the reaction
conditions for the selective
(E)-di-iodination of alkynes by the dried Dowex H+/NaI method can be seen in Scheme 2. In Table 1, we have collected 12 examples of the prepared products
(13–24) from different kinds of alkynes
(1–12) using dried Dowex H+ cation-exchange resin with dried NaI. All of the reactions were
performed in 2-propanol with the reagents left overnight (approx.
18 h) at 65 °C with 2.05 or 3 equiv of dried NaI as described
in Scheme 2 and Table 1; more detailed reaction
conditions and isolation procedures can be found in the Experimental Section.

c 3 Equiv NaI was used in the reaction.

The alkynes (1–12) for the iodination
experiments were selected on the basis that the compounds were readily
available, known to be cost-effective and eco-friendly and that those
compounds have different kinds of functionalities and alkyl chains.
All compounds (1–12) are commercially
available; however, the ester 7 was prepared using the
dried Dowex H+/NaI approach with the catalytic system that
we recently reported.35 We have previously
reported the preparation of compound 17 from propargyl
alcohol (5); however, in that case, we used only 1 equiv
of NaI in the reaction and obtained a 60% yield.33 In this paper, 2.05 equiv of NaI was used and the yield
improved to 71% since now the propargyl alcohol (5) conversion
to 17 was far more effective (actually the yield was
only 30% when 1 equiv NaI was used if the yield was calculated from
propargyl alcohol 5 because the di-iodinated product 17 was formed).

In general, according to the SciFinder
search, very little attention
has been paid to the (E)-di-iodinated compounds 13–24, which we have prepared and can
be seen in Table 1.
Surprisingly, compounds 19 and 21 were totally
unknown and we could find only one reference for each of the compounds 14,3615,520,3 and 22(37) in the literature. In addition,
in the preparation of compounds 18 and 23, only two38,39 or three31,40,41 methods have been described, respectively.
This was rather unexpected because of the importance of (E)-di-iodinated compounds as discussed in the introduction.

In general, the synthesis of the target products (13–24) was very straightforward; it used 2-propanol
as a solvent, which can be considered as a green alternative, and
most of the products were sufficiently pure (≥95%) after isolation
by extraction or crystallization (compound 23); only
three of the products needed to be purified by column chromatography
or thin-layer chromatography (TLC) (compounds 19, 21, and 24, Experimental Section). The yields were very reasonable (43–78%), except for compound 24 (23%); the main reason for this might be some kind of degradation
of the starting material or intermediate products because only 126
mg of crude product was obtained after the isolation of 24 (Experimental Section), which is only about
a 41% yield of the theoretical amount of 308 mg (100%).

The
adoption of the dried Dowex H+/NaI approach with
2-propanol as the solvent with the reaction conditions presented in
this paper was very selective for (E)-di-iodination
because only in one case (synthesis of novel compound 21) were we able to detect a mono-iodinated compound in the crude product
and then according to the 1H NMR spectrum, only in very
small amounts (<5%). In the crude product of novel compound 19, we observed only the desired product (19)
and approximately 10% of the starting material 7; e.g.,
no monoiodinated compounds were present according to the 1H NMR spectrum. The above-mentioned observations were the main reasons
for the need of purification by column chromatography of compounds 19 and 21. Additionally, we also tested acetonitrile
as a solvent with the dried Dowex H+/NaI approach for the
di-iodination of alkynes with poor selectivity: mixtures of compounds
were observed according to the 1H NMR spectra; however,
in some cases, the results were sufficiently interesting for the research
to be continued utilizing acetonitrile as the solvent.

In the
(E)-di-iodination reactions, 2.05 or 3
equiv of NaI was used; the reason for the use of 3 equiv NaI instead
of 2.05 equiv in the case of 15, 19, and 21 were in better yields, e.g., in the synthesis of 15, the yields were 68 and 51%, respectively, whereas in the
synthesis of 22, there was no difference if 3 equiv or
2.05 equiv of NaI was used (71 or 72% yields, respectively). The mass/mass
ratios of the dried Dowex H+ and NaI utilized in the above-mentioned
experiments were approximately the same [e.g., in the case of 22, Dowex H+/NaI (1000 mg/300 mg, 3 equiv) or (700
mg/205 mg, 2.05 equiv)]. In general, the mass ratios varied from 2.6
to 4.4/1.0 (Dowex H+/NaI), meaning that the amount of Dowex
H+ was not optimized; actually, investigations to define
the “optimal” amount of dried Dowex H+ in
the reactions are underway, and these will be published in the future.

Last but not least, we also tested the di-iodination reaction for
the alkyne containing a carboxylic acid group (25, Scheme 3) and observed that
there was a selective (E)-di-iodination and esterification
at the same time in the one-pot reaction to produce compound 19 with a 32% yield. The result was not surprising because
of our earlier experiences of the benefits of utilizing dried Dowex
H+/NaI as a catalyst for esterification reactions.35 However, according to a SciFinder search, as
far as we are aware, this is the first example of the addition of
any kind of halogen to a triple bond with the esterification of carboxylic
acid (substitution and condensation reactions) at the same time in
a one-pot reaction.

Conclusions
A
selective method for (E)-di-iodination of alkynes
by using the dried Dowex H+/NaI approach has been presented.
Di-iodinations were achieved using only an I– (NaI)
source instead of the more common I2 or both I– and I+ (e.g., ICl). In the method, a green solvent, 2-propanol,
was used along with reasonable reaction conditions, and in addition,
most of the products did not need any chromatography purifications
after their isolation by extraction or crystallization (compound 23). The initial example of the addition of iodine to the
triple bond and esterification at the same time in one-pot reaction
has been demonstrated. The exact reaction mechanism for di-iodination
is unclear, although it is a topic of interest and, if solved, will
be published as soon as possible with our further studies related
to other reactions, which can be conducted with the present method.
Furthermore, the method presented here may open a new way to produce
very important radio-iodinated compounds. Ultimately, we believe that
our method will become widely used in various kinds of organic syntheses
as described in our earlier publications33−35 and the results
presented here.

Experimental Section
General
1H and 13C NMR spectra
were recorded on a 600 MHz spectrometer operating at 600.2 and 150.9
MHz, respectively. The solvent residual peak was used as a standard
in the 1H and 13C{1H} measurements
in deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) and deuterated methanol
(CD3OD) (7.26 or 77.16 ppm for CDCl3 and 3.31
or 49.00 ppm for CD3OD),42 in
D2O 4.79 ppm in 1H measurements, and added CD3OD in the 13C{1H} measurements (49.00
ppm). The nJHH couplings were
calculated from the proton spectra, and all J values
are given in Hz. The appropriate two-dimensional NMR measurements
were performed to confirm structures when needed. Mass spectra were
recorded on a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer using electrospray
ionization (ESI) with a positive ionization mode for compound 19 and a negative ionization mode for compound 21. The purity of the products was determined from 1H spectrum
and was ≥95% unless stated otherwise. All starting materials
(1–12) and the Dowex H+ ion-exchange resin used in the study were commercially available;
however, isopropyl hex-5-ynoate (7) was prepared using
the method we reported recently.35
