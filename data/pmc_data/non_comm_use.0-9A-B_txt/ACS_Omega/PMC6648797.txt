Microwave (MW)-assisted
catalytic degradation, being an emerging
technique, can potentially fill in the technological gap which promises on-demand, prompt, and efficient catalysis, and therefore,
suitable MW catalysts are curiously being hunted. Candidature of spinel
zinc ferrite (SZFO) atomic sheets as a MW catalyst has thoroughly
been investigated in this article. Analytical techniques prove SZFO
atomic sheets to be highly crystalline, thermally stable, good dielectric,
and superparamagnetic, which render it a potentially strong MW catalyst.
Brilliant green (BG) has been demonstrated to be chemisorbed on the
SZFO atomic sheets, which upon MW irradiation gets mineralized within
5 min, and the overall efficiency has been observed to be >99%.
Total
organic carbon removal of ∼80% has been obtained. Ionic chromatography
proves the formation of SO42– and NO3– anions which increase with MW exposure
time. Liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy studies have established
intermediate formations during catalysis. SZFO, established as a uniquely
suited and highly efficient MW catalyst for BG, is expected to broaden
the horizons of MW-assisted catalytic degradation and lead it toward
its broader applications.

Introduction
Organic pollutants
(BG, i.e., brilliant green, a triarylmethane
group of dye; being one of them) in water due to industrial waste
are carcinogenic and mutagenic in nature and cause skin diseases,
eye irritation and breathing problems.1,2 BG exhibits
exceptionally high visibility even in minute concentration. It can
cause diarrhea and abdominal pain when being ingested and is said
to be toxic to plants and aquatic lives as well. To treat organically
polluted water, electro-chemical treatment, ultrasound treatment,
photocatalysis, ion exchange, photo-fenton process, and so forth have
already been employed.3−6 Most of these existing techniques are slow and inefficient. Attaining
high degradation efficiency is very crucial and therefore, is presently
being sought in desirable future technologies for wastewater treatment,
as otherwise it will cost severe health hazards. Microwave (MW)-assisted
catalytic degradation seems to be extremely promising, as it would
cut short the time needed for the treatment and is supposed to be
extremely efficient as well.7−9 However, research on MW-assisted
catalytic degradation is still in its infancy. MW is capable of an
extreme level of achievable power density and fast delivery.10−12 Achieving high absorption of MW by the catalyst is however very
crucial.13 Along this line of research,
activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, polymers, and transition-metal
oxides such as MnO2 have earlier been reported as MW catalysts.14−18 However, structural stability against MW irradiation is a cause
of concern to practically realize MW degradation, and that is why
the selection of MW catalyst is pivotal. Spinel ferrites have earlier
been suggested to have potential as a MW catalyst because of their
structural stability.19 Nanoscale spinel
zinc ferrite (SZFO) appears to have good candidature for MW catalyst
because of the (a) economic cost of precursors, (b) easy synthesis
protocol, (c) room-temperature magnetic behavior, (d) semiconducting
nature (metals are avoided in MW),10,20,21 (e) magnetic retrievability of the catalyst,22 and (f) robustness under thermal spike generated
in an MW oven. Even though SZFO seems to have great candidature as
the MW catalyst, yet it has never been employed for this purpose,
which makes it urgent to explore.

Gauging the need of the hour,
we have therefore explored the potential
of SZFO atomic sheets as a MW catalyst. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) have been employed to investigate morphology and surface features
of the synthesized sheets of SZFO. X-ray and electron diffraction
have been used to establish structure identity. Raman, X-ray photoelectron
(XPS), photoluminescence (PL), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopy techniques have been employed to investigate the synthesized
sheet regarding its physical and chemical behavior. A vibrating sample
magnetometer (VSM) and vector network analyzer (VNA) were used to
explore magnetic and dielectric behavior of SZFO atomic sheets. To
establish MW-assisted catalytic degradation by SZFO for degrading
BG and to analyze products, the host of analytical techniques, for
example, UV–vis spectroscopy, ion chromatography (IC), total
organic carbon (TOC), liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LCMS),
and FTIR spectroscopies were employed.

Results and Discussion
MW-assisted catalytic degradation of BG (C27H33N2·HSO4–) by SZFO atomic
sheets has been demonstrated for the first time. A normal SZFO structure
has molecular sheets weakly interacting with each other (see Figure1a).23 Molecular sheets of SZFO can be exfoliated; however, there
is no report explicitly describing the exfoliation.24 Coprecipitation (at low temperature ∼60 °C)
using zinc and iron chloride precursors and distilled water (DW) solvent
has been employed to synthesize SZFO nanopowder, which upon calcination
looks dark brown (see Figure1b). Aqueous solution of BG which has bluish green appearance
upon adsorption turns light green (cyan shade), and the supernatant
achieved by MW treatment of the cyan solution for up to 5 min followed
by centrifugation is visibly transparent (see Figure1c). The first proof that SZFO has sheet-like
features was evidenced in the SEM image (Figure1d). AFM imaging reveals molecular sheets
having lateral dimensions ∼20–60 nm and measured thickness
∼2.4 nm which would be 3–4 layers (Figure1e). TEM imaging reveals tinnier
sheets (see Figure1f). Sheets in Figure 1f are electron transparent and as is apparent, they are very thin;
which seems to be just few molecular layers. Atoms are above 5 Å
apart, and the material is crystalline.

Selected area fast Fourier transform (FFT) shows intersecting
hexagonal
pattern (see the inset in Figure 1g) and such a pattern is usual in spinel ferrites.25 Interplanar distances were observed to be 0.30
and 0.47 nm at two different locations in TEM image of the SZFO sheets
(see Figure 1h) which
is matching with the existing literature.26 Hydrodynamic particle size distribution seems to be uniform, as
this is apparent from nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) (see Figure 1i), and the approximate
particle size is ∼100 nm. As the NTA experiment was carried
out in the aqueous form, uniformity suggests stability of the dispersion,
and it is also supported by Tyndall effect experiments (see Figure 1j).

Obtained
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns shown in Figure 2a establish a spinel cubic
structure (JCPDS no. 22-1012) of the synthesized SZFO sheets. Higher
calcination temperature (700 °C) gives rise to heat diffusion
which in turn helps uniform crystallization. SZFO sheets exhibited
characteristic Raman vibrational modes.27 Raman peaks positioned at ∼332.2 and 652.7 cm–1 shown in Figure 2b attest to the phase purity. The XPS survey reveals that the synthesized
sheet exhibited Zn 2p, Fe 2p, and O 1s peaks (see Figure 2c). When individual peaks were
resolved and deconvoluted (see Figure 2d–f), we could get further information. The
Zn 2p spectrum shows two peaks at binding energy (BE) of 1020.6 and
1044 eV, which refers to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively.

Oxidation state of zinc, that
is, +2 is thus revealed. A fine scan
of Fe 2p peak exhibits two subpeaks. Upon deconvolution, the first
peak (Fe 2p3/2) is resolved into 713.7 and 710.7 eV, and
another peak (Fe 2p1/2) gets resolved into 725.3 and 719.2
eV. The oxidation state of Fe, that is, +3 is thus revealed. Furthermore,
the O 1s peak (Figure2f) can be resolved into two subpeaks (upon deconvolution) viz. 529.2
eV (for lattice oxygen) and 530.7 eV for (surface adsorbed oxygen
species). A Tauc plot is obtained from optical reflectance data employing
the Kubelka–Munk function (i.e., α = (1 – R)2/2R), where α is the
absorption coefficient and R is the diffuse reflectance
that reveals band gap energy of ZnFe2O4 to be
2.47 eV, which characterizes the semiconducting nature of the synthesized
sheets (see Figure2g).

Applications already explored for SZFO include high-density
data
storage, radio sensitization, gas sensing, photocatalysis, drug delivery,
and heterogeneous catalysis.28−32 UV photocatalysis is usually employed for photocatalysis, as it
has higher photon energy in contrast to visible light. However, colored
wastewater is opaque for UV light, and therefore, the degradation
is inefficient and takes prolonged time to achieve the decoloring.
MW degradation fits in this context, as catalyst, solvent, and dyes
all are dielectric in nature, and therefore, one expects dielectric
absorption of MW which in effect is expected to break functionalities
in dye molecules.

Absorption spectra of BG adsorbed on the SZFO
catalyst surface
at various MW exposure times (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 min) are shown
in Figure 3a. The inset
in Figure 3a indicates
pseudo first-order kinetics. In fact, purely, adsorption itself would
reduce absorption of dye (by ∼26%) (see Figure S3a). Adsorption of dye molecules plays the active
role in final degradation efficiency, as it helps in interaction between
the dye and catalyst. To explore the role of a catalyst, MW exposure
was carried out in the absence of any catalyst, and we found that
it causes ∼19% reduction in absorption peak intensity (see Figure S3a). To obtain the degradation rate, C/C0 was plotted against time
(see Figure 3b). Before
any MW treatment would commence, adsorption was attained, which helps
MW degradation, as it brings molecules closer to the dye. SZFO sheets
possess a negative zeta potential (ζ) of −26.8 mV, which
may cause these sheets to adsorb cationic BG molecules. To explore
the interaction between the dye molecule and the catalyst, we carried
out Raman spectroscopy of dyes adsorbed on the catalyst. Interestingly
enough, catalyst Raman modes (340, 480, and 645 cm–1) have been shifted and new peaks arise upon adsorption (see Figure S3b). Thus, Raman peak shifts ∼7
cm–1 have been registered which in vivid terms indicate
chemisorption.33 Langmuir and Freundlich
isotherms corresponding to adsorption are shown in Figure S3c,d, respectively, and parameters can be found in Table S1. It is interesting to note that Langmuir
model fits better with the data.

Figure 3 (a) UV–vis absorption spectra of
aqueous BG solution when
treated with MW irradiation in the presence of the SZFO sheets as
a catalyst (inset shows the kinetics). (b) Rate of degradation as
a function of time of BG (adsorption regime is shown); (c) effect
of MW power; (d) initial concentration; and (e) pH on the degradation
of BG. (f) Cyclic tests of the ZnFe2O4 magnetic
catalyst.

The absorption peak of BG at λ
= 624 nm was decreased upon
increasing MW exposure time, and it was totally decolorized (approx.
99% degradation) after 5 min (see Figure 3a). As it turns out that with respect to
the other parameters, MW power is the most crucial determining factor
in this experiment. MW power was varied in 200–800 W range,
and other parameters such as concentration of BG solution (20 mg/L),
weight of SZFO catalyst (0.05 g), and MW exposure time (5 min) were
kept constant.

The degradation extent was gradually increased
with the MW power
from 200 to 800 W; however, it technically saturates ∼360 W
(see Figure 3c). Therefore,
the output power of 360 W was considered for further studies. For
practical applications, however, initial concentration of dyes is
the most influential factor, and therefore, the effect of initial
concentration of BG (in 10–100 mg/L range) on the extent of
degradation was investigated. As can be observed in Figure 3d, for concentration below
80 mg/L, more than 99% degradation has been realized within 5 min
of MW irradiation, and about 73.2% degradation was observed in 5 min
for an initial concentration of 100 mg/L. There will thus be a maximum
concentration of BG which will suffice to make an adsorbed layer,
above which it would cause the formation of a second or third layer
(clustering of dye molecules could also not be ruled out) which will
make dye layers opaque medium for MW and the catalyst would not be
exposed and therefore would not be activated, resulting in the decrease
of degradation efficiency. To explore how pH of an aqueous solution
of dye influences degradation, we carried out an experiment with various
pH of solutions (pH = 3–11), and we found that below pH = 5,
degradation is poor (see Figure3e). To test whether the SZFO catalyst can be used in cycles,
we carried out experiments over four cycles, and the result was wonderful.
Up to four cycles of usage, the catalyst delivers over 97.1% degradation
efficiency (see Figure 3f) and interestingly, the structural quality of the catalyst is intact
even after four cycles, as has been verified by XRD pattern (see Figure S1b).

As a technology, MW-assisted
catalytic degradation is still a new
and, several ferrites have been demonstrated as MW catalysts.13,33 Crucial determining parameters for catalysis include dielectric
and magnetic behavior of catalysts, as they are responsible for the
absorption of MW radiation, which in turn will degrade dye molecules.
To gauge magnetic behavior of the catalyst, vibrating sample magnetometry
was carried out, and in fact, we obtained the signature of the superparamagnetic
nature of SZFO (see Figure 2h) which is characterized by minimal coercive field (∼4
Oe). Magnetization per unit mass was found to be ∼4 emu/g which
indicates sufficient response to the applied external magnetic field.
The magnetoresistance value measured for SZFO is exceedingly high
(∼360%) (see Figure S2), which is
a significant result, especially because of the 2D nature of SZFO
sheets (and it indicates prospective magnetic memory applications
as well). The magnetic nature of the catalyst would help focusing
of the EM wave inside the oven and in retrieving the catalyst after
the degradation as well. To explore dielectric behavior of the catalyst,
VNA was employed. Frequency-dependent real and imaginary parts of
dielectric constant and loss tangent for SZFO are plotted in Figure 2i. One can readily
observe that the real part is ∼4.4 and imaginary part is 0.2
at 2.45 GHz (frequency used in the MW catalytic experiment). Water
being polar has a high dielectric constant (∼80) and BG has
dielectric constant ∼8.5 at 2.45 GHz. MW absorption being dependent
on the effective dielectric function of the catalyst + solvent + dye
molecule, we expect effective focusing of the EM wave in our case,
as all of the three components have high values of ε.

Time-averaged dissipated power density is given by 1  

However, magnetic
field dependence is not as strong as that of
the electric field, and therefore, one can ignore the magnetic field
term. In such a case, therefore, dissipative power will turn to 2  where ω is the angular frequency, ε0 is dielectric permittivity of vacuum, εr″ is dielectric
loss, E⃗(r) is the electric
field amplitude, μ0 is the magnetic permeability
of vacuum, μ″ is the magnetic loss, and H⃗(r) is the magnetic field amplitude.34,35

Upon efficient absorption of MW, local electric field and
hence
temperature at the central region of the oven and at the catalyst
surface will be high (estimated temperature > 1000 °C),13−15,36 which has an equivalent energy
of 0.1 eV = 1.6 × 10–20 J. Bond dissociation
energy for C=N, C=C, and C–H (primary bonds in
BG) are 615, 614, and 413 kJ/mol, respectively. Energy needed to break
C=N and C=C bonds in one molecule is about 1.02 ×
10–18 J. Thus, the absorbed energy would be sufficient
to break these bonds and hence decolorization of BG. Thermal stability
of the catalyst is crucial in MW degradation as the peak temperature
goes high. Delightfully though, SZFO sheets have been found to have
appreciably high thermal stability even in high-temperature range,
and weight loss (marginal though) can be attributed to moisture desorption
(see Figure S1a). While MW is ON, because
of the interaction with the catalyst, dye molecules will experience
generated local electric field and thermal spike. Such a directional
field would increase vibration of bonds, and local temperature adds
to that effect. Bonds in BG which are weaker (e.g., C–H) will
break first, and then, relatively stronger bonds (e.g. C=C
or C=N) will break later. In such a scenario, bond angle changes
are also envisaged. Moreover, the formation of intermediates is expected
as well, and in fact, we have obtained a proof of intermediate products
in LCMS measurements. As shown in Figure 5, four different m/z peaks, namely 385.2, 340.2, 227.1, and 226.9
were detected. The corresponding intermediate and possible degradation
mechanism of BG found due to MW irradiation are similar to that of
UV photocatalysis by anions or by Fenton processes.37,38 The formation of the first intermediate with m/z value of 340.2 results due to the elimination of −C2H5N and −H2 from the BG structure
which originally exhibited an m/z value of 385.2. It attests to the degradation of BG. The intermediate
has gone through further transformation because of direct substitution
of OH• radical with the liberation of ethylbenzene
(C6H6–C2H5) and
ethylene (C2H4), and this resulted in further
reduction of the m/z value down
to 227.1. After that, the abstraction of H atom from the resulting
intermediate causes m/z to dip further
into the lowest value of 226.9.

(signatures
of intermediates are evidenced).

FTIR spectroscopy carried out on dye chemisorbed on the SZFO
catalyst
surface before and after MW treatment reveals that MW exposure reduces
some peaks substantially (blue shaded), and even new peaks have evolved
(red and green shaded) as one can observe in Figure 4a. To gauge carbon contents in the intermediate
and final products, TOC measurement was carried out, and the results
revealed 80.1% disappearance of organic carbon of BG chemisorbed on
the SZFO catalyst when MW treatment was carried out in contrast to
60.8% TOC level upon adsorption without MW treatment (see Figure 4b). To confirm the
final degradation products of BG in aqueous solution, IC was also
employed. It could be observed that the IC peaks (see Figure 4c) corresponding to NO3–, SO4–2 gradually
increases along with the increasing MW irradiation time. It seems
that C=N and weak electrostatic sulfur bonding of BG were broken
gradually, and then, nitrogen and sulfur were oxidized into NO3– and SO4–2 anions, respectively. It means that BG in aqueous solution could
be mineralized into simple and innoxious inorganic ions under MW irradiation
in the presence of an SZFO catalyst.

To explore the species,
that is, ions and radicals forming while
decomposition of BG takes place, scavenging experiments were carried
out with trapping reagents, for example, ammonium oxalate (AO) (1
mM), isopropyl alcohol (IPA) (1 mM), p-benzoquinone
(BQ) (1 mM) for holes, hydroxyl, and superoxide radicals30,39,40 (see Figure S4a). Without scavenging, degradation efficiency was found
to be about 99.6%. While IPA (•OH scavenger) or
BQ (•O2– scavenger)
were introduced to the BG solution, the degradation rate was decreased
(degradation efficiency was found to be 83.2 and 92.7% respectively).
Thus, it is established that decolorization is significantly influenced
by active species such as •OH and •O2–. Degradation efficiency dropped
down from 99.6 to 8%, hinting at the active role of holes in the catalytic
process.

To establish the participation of •OH in the
MW degradation process of BG, terephthalic acid (TPA) was employed
as a probe molecule in the fluorescence spectrophotometer. TPA instantly
reacts with •OH radical to result in fluorescent
2-hydroxy TPA which has excitation and emission wavelength at ∼315
and ∼425 nm, respectively. Fluorescence spectra from 0.3 mM
TPA solution at various irradiation times are shown in Figure S4b. As MW exposure increases, there is
a gradual enhancement in fluorescence peak intensity at ∼425
nm, which reaffirms the generation of •OH radicals
(see Figure S5). When BG chemisorbed on
the SZFO sheet catalyst was exposed to MW irradiation >360 W in
aqueous
solution, extreme local electric field and hence spike in temperature
is attained (see Figure 6). Under these extreme conditions, SZFO (Eg = 2.47 eV) being a semiconductor gets excited, and electrons and
holes are generated. Electrons give •O2– upon reaction with O2, and holes give •OH upon reaction with H2O. These radicals
then oxidize BG into harmless intermediates along with the formation
CO2 and H2O.

Figure 6 Schematic diagram illustrating the mechanism
of MW degradation
of BG by an SZFO catalyst.

Catalysis employing electromagnetic waves are most sought
after,
as it provides green technology for wastewater treatment (see the
detailed overview in Figure 7). Among electromagnetic waves, sunlight is available free
of cost. However, there is no selectivity of wavelength, and energy
delivered per unit volume of the catalyst is very less which are the
reasons for a long time and less efficiency of catalysis. Other artificial
sources of visible light can also be employed and in fact, several
such attempts have been made to use highly focused light utilizing
several lenses. However, because photon energy (hc/λ) is less and that is why even after focusing, it is difficult
to attain high beam energy. Ultraviolet light sources are better in
that sense, and photon energy is relatively higher, and therefore,
even without much effort, one can in principle get better beam energy
and hence improved catalytic efficiency.41−45 MW energy is highly tunable in a controlled manner
with extremely high precision by externally controlled MW power. That
is the reason that in recent years, it has been employed in catalysis
and still is an emerging technology as far as catalysis is concerned.46−49 However, the choice of catalysts (which efficiently responds to
MW) and catalyst–organic dye interaction is of essence (chemisorption
is desirable though) and these have to be suitably and adequately
be satisfied so as to attain higher efficiency. Our present effort
has been to improve on these vital aspects of MW-assisted catalytic
degradation which has indeed worked well, and the results obtained
in the present report is better than the existing literature in MW-based
catalytic degradation.

Conclusions
In tune with the emergence
of MW-assisted catalytic degradation
technology, we have demonstrated for the first time the use of SZFO
atomic sheets as a MW catalyst. We have employed the SZFO catalyst
because of its unique set of magnetic as well as dielectric attributes
and in addition because of its appreciable thermal stability. Atomically
thin SZFO sheets acted as an excellent anchor for BG molecules which
got chemisorbed on the catalyst surface due possibly to π–π
interactions. SZFO being semiconducting in nature, upon MW exposure,
results in the formation of electron and holes which react with water
and oxygen to finally mineralize dye molecules. This is the first
report of its kind employing SZFO sheets as the MW catalyst. In contrast
to UV photocatalysis which suffers from poor efficiency and needs
prolonged duration for finishing reaction, MW-assisted catalytic degradation
is yet an emerging technology for wastewater treatment, which seems
to have enormous potential, as it is highly efficient, and the whole
reaction finishes within few minutes. We have demonstrated that SZFO
sheets (which are easily synthesizable) are environmentally benign.
It is delightful to note that MW-assisted catalytic degradation by
SZFO sheets is exemplary by any means, as evident from excellent efficiency
(>99%) and prompt degradation (within ∼5 min) for completion
of the degradation reaction vis-à-vis existing catalysis technologies.
It is noteworthy that SZFO catalysts exhibit recyclability upon magnetic
retrieval (due to magnetic nature of SZFO). In light of all these
qualities, therefore, we propose SZFO sheets as an extraordinary MW
catalyst. Extensive experiments have been carried out to figure out
a mechanism/pathway of MW degradation of BG molecules. Our research
findings are poised to give new directions to MW-assisted catalytic
degradation and relevant future research, we believe.

Materials and
Methods
Materials
All chemical reagents viz. ferric chloride
hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O), zinc chloride
(ZnCl2), BG that is BG (C27H34N2O4S), AO ((NH4+)2·–O=C(O)–C(O)=O–), BQ (C6H4O2), IPA (C3H8O) were >99% purity (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich),
and NaOH pellet were purchased from Merck. Double distilled water
(DW) water was employed throughout the experiments.

Synthesis of
ZnFe2O4
SZFO sheets
were synthesized by the coprecipitation method.50 ZnCl2 (1.36 g) and FeCl3·6H2O (5.40 g) were dissolved in 100 mL of DW water under vigorous
magnetic stirring at 60 °C for 1 h. Then, NaOH was added dropwise
into the above solution until pH increased to ∼11. Finally,
the obtained brown precipitates were collected by centrifugation and
washed with DW water and ethanol six times, and the precipitate was
then dried in an oven at 100 °C for 5 h. After that SZFO nanopowder
was obtained upon calcination at 700 °C for 3 h in a muffle furnace.

Characterizations
Powder XRD patterns of the catalyst
sample was obtained in reflection mode using a Rigaku TTRX-III instrument
equipped with Cu Kα (λ = 1.54 Å) line operating at
a scan rate of 2°/min. SEM images were obtained by using the
Carl Zeiss AG SUPRA 55VP instrument operating at 5 kV. High-resolution
TEM images were acquired using a Technai 210 TEM instrument working
at 200 kV. Diffuse reflectance UV–visible spectroscopy of SZFO
catalyst was obtained in a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrometer instrument
with IRS-2600 Plus attachment using BaSO4 powder as a standard
reference. XPS was attained using ESCA + omicron nanotechnology, Oxford
Instruments, Germany equipped with a monochromator Al as the excitation
source (Al Kα radiation with hν = 1486.7
eV). The instrument was operated at 15 kV and 20 mA. All of the BE
values were taken as referenced to the C 1s peak of carbon at 284.6
eV. FTIR spectra of solid samples were measured in a Shimadzu, IRAffinity-1S,
Japan, instrument. Thermal gravimetric analysis was performed in the
PerkinElmer STA 6000 apparatus with a heating rate of 20 °C min–1 from 40 to 850 °C under a N2 gas
atmosphere (20 mL/min). Raman spectroscopy was carried out employing
an STR 500 Confocal Micro Raman spectrometer, Japan using Nd:YAG laser
(λ = 514.5 nm). Magnetic measurements (M–H hysteresis loop) for SZFO were carried out using a MicroSense
EZ-9 VSM and the measurement was done at room temperature. The mean
hydrodynamic diameter spectra and ζ potential were obtained
using NTA in NanoSight NS300, Malvern Panalytical and Malvern Zetasizer
Nano ZS instrument. Dielectric properties (ε′, ε″)
were obtained employing the VNA (Keysight Technologies E5071C, USA)
instrument. AFM measurements were carried out on SZFO sheets employing
the Agilent 5500 model instrument in dynamic force mode at room temperature
and ambient environment. To find magnetoresistance, magnetic field
was produced by constant current power supply (DPS-50), magnetic field
was measured by a digital gauss meter (DGM-102), and 2-probe resistance
measurement was done at room temperature.

MW Catalytic Degradation
The decolorization performance
of the SZFO catalyst was determined under a dark environment as well
as under MW exposure. The adsorption behavior of BG on the SZFO surface
was evaluated by a batch adsorption process in the dark. The targeted
aqueous solution (50 mL) of organic pollutant BG was placed in a beaker,
and an SZFO catalyst (50 mg) was added to it by using a magnetic stirrer
at a speed of 600 rpm at room temperature (RT). The beaker was completely
covered and sealed with aluminum foil to remove the effect of photocatalytic
degradation. After adsorption–desorption equilibrium was attained,
aqueous solution was added into a 250 mL flat bottom flask, and the
solution was then exposed to MW irradiation (in a temperature controlled
domestic MW oven (Panasonic, 2.45 GHz) attached with a reflux condenser)
at various power levels (see experimental setup, Figure S6). After MW irradiation was carried out, the solution
was then centrifuged, and the concentration of centrifuged solution
was determined employing UV–vis spectroscopy.

Analytical
Methods
The BG concentrations were recorded
according to the absorbance at 624 nm wavelength using UV–vis
spectroscopy. TOC measurements were carried out for original solution,
after adsorption and 5 min of treatment in the MW using an OI-Analytical
(Aurora 1030) analyzer. PL spectra obtained from the fluorospectrometer
(PerkinElmer, LS-55) instrument were recorded between 350 and 550
nm at 315 nm excitation. To further identify reaction products, IC
(Metrohm IC 82) has been used for sample examination. The sample flow
rate was 0.7 mL/min. Note that Na2CO3 and NaHCO3 were used as eluents. The reaction intermediates were detected
by LCMS (Agilent G6545B, USA). The samples were chromatographically
separated using an Agilent 1290 Infinity 11 UHPLC system on a ZORBAX
RRHD eclipse plus C 18 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.8 μm) with
a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min and injection volume of 0.4 μL. The
solutions A and B were 0.1% formic acid and 100% acetonitrile, respectively.
The ion mode was set on positive mode, and mass fragments were observed
from m/z 100 to 1000.

Analysis of
Active Species
To confirm the effective
role of some active species on the catalytic performance of the catalyst,
trapping experiments were followed up. The main trapping agents, that
is, scavengers such as AO, IPA, and BQ for h+, •OH, and •O2– radicals, respectively,
were used.
