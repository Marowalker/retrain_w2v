Polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are interesting building
blocks for the preparation of conjugated polymers due to their extended
π surface and planar conformation. However, their use as comonomer
in conjugated polymers often leads to nonplanar main chains as a consequence
of high steric hindrance at the linking point. Herein, we report the
synthesis of a ladderized anthanthrene unit using an sp3 carbon bridge. Three conjugated copolymers with fluorene, isoindigo,
and bithiophene derivatives have been synthesized and characterized
to study the effect of such ladderization on the electronic properties.
The dihedral angle between the ladderized anthanthrene and adjacent
units has been significantly reduced by the formation of the sp3 carbon bridge, thus eliminating the steric hindrance with
the proton at the peri position of the anthanthrene
unit and red-shifting the absorption spectrum by 25 nm.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are very useful, yet underestimated
building blocks for the preparation of organic semiconductors.1,2 Their extended π surface, ease of functionalization, and large
variety of edge topologies have allowed the preparation of small molecules
and polymers with a wide range of band gaps.3−5 Moreover, their
flat surface allows for strong π–π interactions
in the solid state, leading to excellent morphological features for
improved charge transport properties.6−8 Hence, PAH-based semiconductors
have shown promise as the active component for different applications,
including organic solar cells (OSCs),9−11 field-effect transistors
(OFETs),12 and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).13

Despite their obvious advantages, a rather
low number of large
PAHs have been introduced into conjugated polymers for organic electronics,
the main limitations being the scarce availability of functionalized
PAHs and their low solubility. Recently, we and others showed that
PAH 4,10-dibromoanthanthrone, a low-cost dye known as vat orange 3,
is well suited for the preparation of a wide diversity of organic
semiconductors.14−19 This compound allows for functionalization at the ketone (6,12)
and bromine (4,10) positions using well-known coupling methods such
as Suzuki–Miyaura, Castro–Stephens–Sonogashira,
Wittig-type reactions, and so on.20,21 Using these
reactions, moderate band gap conjugated polymers and small molecules
for OSCs and OFETs have been prepared.15,16 However, the
synthesis of low band gap materials from 4,10-dibromoanthanthrone
is very challenging because the protons at the peri positions (3,9) induce steric hindrance with the adjacent aryl or
heteroaryl units attached at the 4 and 10 positions. Strategies including
the formation of intramolecular H-bonding22 or the addition of alkyne spacers16 can
help to reduce the steric hindrance and lower the band gap, but these
are not sufficient to obtain low-band gap polymers.

Herein,
we report a new approach to reduce the dihedral angle between
anthanthrene and π-conjugated moieties attached at the 4 and
10 positions that consist of creating an sp3 carbon bridge
at the 3 and 9 positions of the anthanthrene.23−26 The resulting π-extended,
ladderized anthanthrene moiety was polymerized with three monomers,
namely, fluorene, bithiophene, and isoindigo, and their properties
were characterized using thermal analysis, optical spectroscopy, and
electrochemistry. Interestingly, the elimination of steric hindrance
at the peri position leads to a red shift (25 nm)
of the absorption band.

2 Results and Discussion
The synthetic strategy for the monomers and polymers is shown in Scheme 1. 6,12-Dioctyloxy-4,10-dibromoanthanthrone
(compound 1), obtained in one step from 4,10-dibromoanthanthrone,20 was borylated at the 4 and 10 positions using
a standard Miyaura reaction to give compound 3. Then,
a two-fold Suzuki–Miyaura coupling with methyl 2-iodobenzoate
or methyl 5-bromo-2-iodobenzoate provides compounds 4a and 4b, respectively. Treatment of these compounds
with an excess of 4-octylphenyl lithium in THF at −78 °C
followed by a BF3·OEt2-catalyzed intramolecular
Friedel–Crafts reaction26 lead to
compounds 5a and 5b in 73 and 67% yields
over two steps, respectively. Compound 5b was polymerized
with bisborylated isoindigo27 and fluorene28 derivatives using a Suzuki–Miyaura coupling
to give PsAI and PsAF, respectively. After 72 h of reaction, the polymers were
precipitated in methanol, washed in a Soxhlet apparatus using methanol,
hexanes, and acetone successively to remove catalyst residues and
oligomers, and extracted using chloroform. For the synthesis of PsABT, a Stille coupling between 5,5′-trimethylstannyl-2,2′-bithiophene
and compound 5b was used to provide the polymer that
was purified using the purification method used for PsAI and PsAF. All three
polymers are highly soluble in chloroform, THF, and aromatic solvents.
The excellent solubility of these polymers can be ascribed to the
presence of two substituted carbons, which prevent aggregation through
π–π interactions and to the presence of six octyl
chains per ladderized anthanthrene unit.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Model
Compound 2 and Ladderized Anthanthrene-Based
Polymers
The molecular weight
values were determined using size exclusion
chromatography (SEC) with polystyrene standard in trichlorobenzene
at 110 °C as the eluent. The results are summarized in Table 1. All three polymers
exhibit high molecular weight with Mn values
ranging from 33.6 (PsAF) to 103.6 kDa
(PsABT), corresponding to a degree of
polymerization (Xn) between 17 and 63.

a Determined from
SEC analysis.

b Determined
using thermogravimetric
analysis under nitrogen at 5% weight loss.

The Td values were determined
using
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). In all cases, the polymers started
decomposing at ca. 300 °C (5% weight loss), meaning that the
ladderized anthanthrene is likely the most thermal-sensitive part
of the polymers. The Td values are very
similar to those measured for anthanthrone-based polymers16,29 and are thermally stable enough for the large majority of organic
electronics applications.

The optical properties of the polymers
were determined using UV–vis
and fluorescence spectroscopy, and the results are summarized in Figures 1 and 2 and Table 2. To study the influence of the planarization through ladderization,
a model compound (2, Scheme 1) was synthesized, characterized by UV–vis
spectroscopy, and compared to compound 5a, which differs
from the monomer 5b only by the absence of bromine atoms
at both ends. As expected, the planarization through ladderization
shifted the absorption toward longer wavelength by 25 nm in solution
(461 nm for 2 vs 486 nm for 5a), while the
fluorescence band red-shifted by 31 nm. Also, the planarization yields
to a decrease of the fluorescence quantum yield in solution from 71%
for compound 2 to 48% for compound 5a. Density
functional theory (DFT) calculations (specifically ω-B97X-D/6-31
+ G(d,p))30 have been performed on compound 2 to assess the dihedral angle (θ) between the anthanthrene
core and the aryl units (Figure S2). As
hypothesized, the phenyl moieties adopt a nonplanar position relative
to the anthanthrene unit with a dihedral angle ranging from 61–63°,
with a high barrier of energy to planarity (∼12 kcal/mol) due
to the steric hindrance. This high barrier to planarity might explain
the poor electronic communication usually observed for anthanthrene
derivatives.21 As a consequence of their
rigidity, both compounds 2 and 5a exhibit
a small Stokes shift and a well-defined vibronic structure. Likewise,
the polymers PsAF and PsABT also exhibit small Stokes shift, indicative
of a quite rigid polymer backbone whose conformation in both ground
and excited states are very similar.31 Additionally,
DFT calculations were performed to study the dihedral angle for simplified
structures of PsAI (37°), PsAF (38°), and PsABT (30°). PsAF exhibits
a shallow barrier to rotation of about 2.75 kcal/mol between two structures,
while PsABT is able to rotate freely
with a barrier around 2.86 kcal/mol. PsAI presented convergence issues, and hence, only the minimum value
is reported.

All
three polymers exhibit strong absorption in the UV and visible
regions that extend up to 700 nm in the case of PsAI. Surprisingly, the extension of conjugation through the
formation of a conjugated polymer did not have a significant effect
on the λmax value for PsAF and PsAI whose absorption spectrum
in solution is red-shifted by only 8 and 2 nm compared to monomer 5a, respectively. This result suggests that the electronic
interaction between the anthanthrene and the isoindigo or fluorene
unit is still rather weak. The very broad absorption band centered
at λ = 563 nm can be attributed to the π–π*
transition of the isoindigo unit, confirming the inefficient conjugation
with the anthanthrene unit.32PsABT exhibits a slightly higher λmax value (502 nm) due to the presence of the smaller thiophene unit.
Going from solution to solid state does not produce a significant
change in the absorption spectra as the λmax values
shifted only slightly (9 nm at most) for all three polymers. Although
more studies need to be performed to understand the poor electronic
interaction between the bridge anthanthrene and various comonomers,
one can argue that the presence of two bulky 4-octyloxyphenyl groups
at the methylene bridge induces significant steric hindrance and linking
position, preventing the moieties to adopt a coplanar conformation.
Müllen and co-workers observed a similar behavior for ladderized
poly(p-phenylene-alt-9,10-anthrylene)s
and reported that the use of smaller methyl groups at the sp3 carbon bridge instead of bulky phenyl rings is an efficient way
to promote planarization within the polymer backbone.26

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed
on the three
polymers, and the results are summarized in Table 3 and Figures S5–S7. The polymers were deposited on a platinum electrode, and the measurements
were taken relative to a Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode in
acetonitrile with tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (NBu4BF4, 0.1 M) as the electrolyte. The energy values of both
the HOMO and LUMO levels were determined as previously described.33

Table 3 Electrochemical Properties
of the
Polymers
compound	Vred (V)	Vox (V)	Eg (eV)	EHOMO (eV)	ELUMO (eV)	
PsAI	–1.10	0.64	1.7	–5.3	–3.6	
PsAF	–1.23	1.24	2.5	–6.0	–3.5	
PsABT	–1.90	0.58	2.5	–5.3	–2.8	
All the peaks in the anodic and cathodic
regime are only partially
reversible in the conditions used (see Supporting Information). Despite the apparent weak electronic communication
between anthanthrene and the units attached to it as observed by electronic
spectroscopy, the oxidation and reduction potential values of all
three polymers are quite different, meaning that the comonomers contribute,
to some extent, in both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. In fact, PsABT, which as an electron-rich bithiophene
unit, possesses a slightly lower Eox value
than PsAI (0.58 vs 0.64 V). Likewise,
the lower Ered value is measured for the
polymer with the more electron-deficient unit (−1.10 V). The
band gap values of all three polymers, although a little underestimated
by electrochemistry, follow the same trend as observed in electronic
spectroscopy (PsAI < PsAF ≈ PsABT).

Potential values have been measured at the onsets of the oxidation
and reductions peaks. The values are reported against Ag/AgNO3 at a scan rate of 50 mV·s–1. With
this reference electrode, the E1/2 value
for Fc/Fc+ was measured at 0.091 V. Vacuum levels were
determined electrochemically with the Fc/Fc+ level at 4.8
eV.

3 Conclusions
We showed that the band gap of
anthanthrene derivatives can be
lowered by introducing an sp3 carbon bridge between anthanthrene
and the phenyl group attached to it at the 4 and 10 positions. Although
the bathochromic shift induce by this bridge is quite limited (25
nm), three copolymers whose properties can be modulated by the nature
of the comonomers have been prepared. Interestingly, a polymer (PsAI) with a band gap value of 2.0 eV has
been prepared, which is one of the lowest values reported to date
for an anthanthrene-based conjugated polymers.16,34 The replacement of the 4-octyloxyphenyl group at the sp3 carbon bridge by smaller groups or the replacement of the phenyl
rings at the 4 and 10 positions by aryls such as thiophene are strategies
that could be envisioned to further reduced the band gap and anthanthrene
derivatives.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 General
NMR analyses were performed
on a Varian Inova AS400 spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, USA) at 400
MHz or on an Agilent DD2 500 MHz. Peaks are identified as m (multiplet),
s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), dd (doublet of doublets), and
dt (doublet of triplets), and J values are reported
in hertz (Hz). The chemical shifts are reported on a ppm scale (δ)
relative to the residual solvent peak. High-resolution mass spectra
(HRMS) analyses were performed on an Agilent 6210 TOF-LCMS instrument
(APPI ion source, Agilent Technologies, Toronto, Canada). Mn and Mw values
of polymers were measured at 110 °C by size exclusion chromatography
(polystyrene as the standards) using a high-temperature Varian Polymer
Laboratories GPC220 (RI detector) in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB)
(with 0.0125% BHT w/v) as the eluent at a flow rate of 1 mL min–1 and a sample concentration of 1.0 mg mL–1 in TCB.35 Absorption and photoluminescence
properties of the compounds were measured using a Varian diode-array
spectrophotometer (model Cary 500) and Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence
spectrofluorometer, respectively, with a 1 cm path length quartz cells.
Cyclic voltammograms were recorded on a potentiostat (Solartron 1287)
with platinum electrodes (working and counter electrodes) at a scan
rate of 50 mV s–1 and a Ag/Ag+ (0.01
M AgNO3 in MeCN) as the reference electrode in an anhydrous
and argon-saturated solution of 0.1 M Bu4NBF4 in MeCN. Bu4NBF4 (98%, Aldrich) is purified
using recrystallization in a mixture of water and methanol and dried
at 70 °C under vacuum.36 In these
conditions, for a freshly prepared reference electrode, the half-wave
oxidation potential (E1/2) of ferrocene
should be around 0.091 V versus Ag/Ag+ as reported by Li
et al.37 The HOMO and LUMO energy levels
are determined from the oxidation and reduction onset.33,38 The onset potentials (E′) are
determined at the position where the current starts to differ from
the baseline.

    TGA spectra were
recorded using a Mettler TGA/SDTA 851e/SF/1100
°C instrument equipped with an MT1 model balance. The balance
is protected with a constant flow of PP nitrogen at a flow of 20 mL/min.
Two milligrams of samples was weighted and heated from 50 to 600 °C
at 20 °C/min.

Chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich
Co.,
Canada, Oakwood Products, Inc., or Strem Chemicals, Inc. and were
used as received. 4,10-Dibromoanthanthrone has been kindly provided
by Heubach GmbH as a Monolite Red 316801 product. 1,1′-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-6,6′-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)isoindigo
was purchased from Brilliant Matters, Canada. 5,5′-Bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene,
2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9,9-didodecylfluorene,
and 4,10-dibromo-6,12-bis(octyloxy)anthanthrene were synthesized according
to literature procedures.20,39,40

Density functional theory calculations were performed with
Gaussian
16 revision B0.141 using the ωB97X-D30 functional and 6-31 + G(d,p) basis set. To simplify
the calculations, the C8H17 alkyl chains were
replaced with methyl groups. The model compound 2 has
four very close geometries in terms of energy due to the angles formed
by the phenyl groups. The four geometries are shown in Figure S1, and thermochemistry computed at 298 K is summarized in Table 1. Further, simplified
structures of compounds PsAI, PsAF, and PsABT were modeled at the same level of theory to study the bridging dihedral
angle. The simplified structures considered are presented in Figures S2–S4.

The quantum yields
(Φ) of the molecules 2 and 5a were
determined by comparing the integrated photoluminescence
and absorbance intensities with a reference fluorophore (fluorescein
(Φ = 0.91)42). As a standard measurement,
the fluorescein was dissolved in 0.1 M NaOH (η = 1.33), and
molecules were dissolved in THF (η = 1.405) with a 10–6 M concentration. All samples were degassed and measured in 1 cm
fluorescence cell by a UV–vis spectrometer, while the absorbance
values are kept below 0.1 to minimize re-absorption effects. The samples
were then measured by a PL spectrometer with constant parameters to
get the PL emission intensity at the excitation wavelength. The quantum
yield was calculated by using the following equation  where Φ is the quantum yield, I is the integrated
PL intensity, η is the refractive
index, and A is the absorbance intensity. The subscript
r refers to the reference fluorophore.

4.1.4 Synthesis of Compound 5a
A flask under nitrogen was charged with THF (5 mL) and 1-bromo-4-octylbenzene
(269 mg, 0.999 mmol). The mixture was purged and degassed with a flow
of nitrogen for 30 min. The solution was cooled at −78 °C. n-BuLi 1.6 M (0.62 mL, 1.00 mmol) was added dropwise to
the solution. The mixture was stirred for 30 min. Compound 4a (100 mg, 0.125 mmol) solubilized in a minimal amount of THF was
added dropwise to the solution. The mixture was stirred for 18 h,
and the temperature slowly increased to room temperature. The solvent
was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the crude product was solubilized
in CH2Cl2. The organic phase was washed with
an NH4Cl saturated solution and dried with MgSO4, and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The product
was solubilized in anhydrous CH2Cl2 in a flask
under nitrogen. The solution was cooled at 0 °C. BF3·OEt2 (few drops) was added dropwise, and the solution
was stirred for 2 h. The organic phase was washed with an NH4Cl saturated solution and dried with MgSO4. Purification

and degassed with a flow of nitrogen for 30 min. The solution was
cooled at −78 °C. n-BuLi 1.6 M (0.57
mL, 0.92 mmol) was added dropwise to the solution. The mixture was
stirred for 30 min. Compound 4b (100 mg, 0.104 mmol)
solubilized in a minimal amount of THF was added dropwise to the solution.
The mixture was stirred for 18 h, and the temperature slowly increases
to room temperature. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure,
and the crude product was solubilized in CH2Cl2. The organic phase was washed with an NH4Cl saturated
solution and dried with MgSO4, and the solvent was evaporated
under reduced pressure. The product was solubilized in anhydrous CH2Cl2 in a flask under nitrogen. The solution was
cooled at 0 °C, BF3·OEt2 (few drops)
was added dropwise, and the solution was stirred for 2 h. The organic
phase was washed with an NH4Cl saturated solution and dried
with MgSO4. Purification by silica gel column chromatography
