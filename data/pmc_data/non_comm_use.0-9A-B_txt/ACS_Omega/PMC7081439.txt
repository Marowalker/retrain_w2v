In this study, we report a metal-ion-assisted
precipitation etching
strategy that can be used to manipulate the optical properties associated
with the assembling of sulfur quantum dots (S dots) using copper ions.
Transmission electron microscopy confirmed that the S dots were mainly
distributed within 50–80 nm and that they exhibited an ambiguous
boundary. After the post-synthetic Cu2+-assisted modification
was completed, the assisted precipitation-etching S dots (APE-S dots)
were observed to exhibit a relatively clear boundary with a high fluorescence
(FL) quantum yield (QY) of 32.8%. Simultaneously, the Fourier transform
infrared radiation, X-ray photoelectron spectra, and time-resolved
FL decay spectra were used to illustrate the improvement in the FL
QY of the APE-S dots.

Introduction
Quantum dots (QDs)
are promising materials exhibiting unique photophysical
and photochemical properties owing to their unique three-dimensional
quantum confinement. Therefore, they can be applied in various fields,
including biological imaging, lasers, solar cells, and light-emitting
diodes.1 However, majority of the high-performance
QDs, including CdS, CdSe, CdTe, HgTe, PbS, and PbSe, and their hybrid
structures are limited by the toxicity of the metal elements, including
Cd, Hg, and Pb.2−4 The intrinsic toxicity of the conventional heavy-metal-based
QDs has hindered their application prospects. To solve the problem
of toxicity, many metal-free elemental QDs have been developed to
satisfy the novel requirements required to obtain the next-generation
green nanomaterials. High-quality pure element QDs that exhibit low
toxicity, excellent solubility, and stable photoluminescence are of
particular interest. Typical examples of metal-free elemental QDs
include carbon QDs,5 graphene QDs,6 black phosphorus QDs,7 and silicon QDs,8 which have been extensively
pursued and studied. In majority of the semiconductor QDs, the fluorescence
(FL) is commonly quenched by aggregation.9 On the contrary, the aggregation of carbon QDs does not result in
any FL quenching. Several studies have proved that cross-linked carbon
dots or polymer carbon nanomaterials, including carbon nanoribbons,
carbon nanosphere, and nanobranch, are attractive materials owing
to their photoluminescence.10,11 Until now, other aggregated
pure elements of QDs exhibiting this phenomenon have not yet been
reported.

Sulfur materials are synthesized in different sizes
and forms and
are applied in various fields.12−14 In particular, sulfur nanomaterials
have attracted considerable attention owing to their inherent optoelectronic
properties. During the previous decade, many researchers have enabled
the facile synthesis of sulfur nanomaterials in various fields, including
sodium–sulfur batteries,15 lithium–sulfur
batteries,16 potassium–sulfur batteries,17 and supercapacitors,18 as well as in some optical applications.19 However, sulfur has been rarely investigated as a luminescent material.
As novel heavy-metal-free QDs, sulfur QDs present a potential alternative
to fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals for several promising applications
in bioimaging, biosensing, and light emission owing to their excellent
aqueous dispersibility, high biocompatibility, photobleaching resistance,
and low toxicity. However, until now, only few groups have reported
the synthesis and the luminescent property of the sulfur QDs (S QDs).20,21 Initially, Li et al. converted the CdS QDs into a low-FL quantum
yield (QY) of S QDs.22 Recently, a satisfactory
QY of up to 3.8% has been obtained for the S QDs synthesized using
polyethylene glycol-400 (PEG-400).23 The
further increase in the high FL QY of S QDs was reported by Wang et
al. They proposed using hydrogen peroxide to assist the synthesis
of S QDs by etching the surface polysulfide species, resulting in
a high FL QY of 23%.24 Another method was
reported to improve the QY of S QDs by the oxidation of the divalent
polysulfide (Sx2–) ions
to zero-valent sulfur (S[0]) under a pure O2 atmosphere
with a FL QY of 21.5%.25 It is reasonable
to believe that other methods can obtain high-FL efficient S QDs.

Only some general effective methods have been used for surface
etching although surface modification based on a ligand exchange reaction
has been actively explored to enhance the FL QY in various nanocrystalline
systems. Herein, a new and facile method has been used for the post-synthesis
of S dots (the assembled S QDs were defined as “S dots”),
where Cu2+ was used to modify the highly luminescent S
dots via a simple surface modification approach in which Cu2+ was the precipitator. When compared with the H2O2-assisted top-down approach (23%), the Cu2+-assisted
precipitation etching S dots (APE-S dots) exhibit a higher FL QY of
32.8% (Figure S1). In this method, no additional
treatment is required and results in the production of a unique fluorescent
nanomaterial for further applications.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 schematically
presents the synthesis of the APE-S dots through a Cu2+-assisted precipitation etching approach. First, the uniform and
well-dispersed assembling of S dots was conducted using the “assemble-fission”
approach of the sublimated sulfur powders with alkali using PEG-400
as the passivation agent. Briefly, the sublimated S powder, PEG-400,
NaOH (4.0 g), and 50 mL of ultrapure water were heated to 70 °C
under continuous stirring, similar to the synthesis method reported
by Shen et al.23 After 72 h, S dots were
observed to be the as-obtained product assembling particles. The as-synthesized
S dots are deep yellow in natural light; however, they emit poor FL
under the radiation of a UV lamp at 365 nm (inset of Figure 1). However, the black precipitation
produced by the addition of Cu2+ did not exhibit any FL.
Interestingly, FL disappeared from the raw liquid; however, after
filtration heating at 70 °C, stronger FL could be observed under continuous
stirring for 30–120 min. The obtained APE-S dots were light
yellow in natural light but emitted a remarkable blue FL under the
radiation of the UV lamp at 365 nm. This may be attributed to surface
etching on the pristine S dots. Thus, the usage of Cu2+ after synthesis is essential to improve the FL activity of the S
dots, which is when compared with the value of 23% reported by Wang
et al.24

Figure 1 Schematic of the synthesis and etching
of S dots through the Cu2+-assisted precipitation approach
and photographic changes
of the S dot FL spectra before and after etching (inset is the photograph
and fluorescent photograph obtained under 365 nm UV light).

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used
to characterize
the morphology of the as-synthesized assembling S dots (A) and APE-S
dots (B). The S dots aggregate to form large assembled particles.
The assembled S dots were mainly distributed in 50–80 nm with
an average diameter of 65 nm (Figure 2A) and an ambiguous boundary. Unlike the H2O2-assisted top-down method, size-controlled optical properties
can be obtained within the S QDs by etching the large S dots to smaller
sizes, obtaining a size-dependent emission color.22 The difference is that the etched APE-S dots show a relatively
clear boundary when compared with the ambiguous boundary of the S
dots (Figure 2B). Based
on the results of the experimental data, we can conclude that during
etching with Cu2+, the edge of the active sulfur atoms
of the APE-S dots react with the Cu2+ ion to etch the surface-active
components of the APE-S, enhancing the FL of APE-S owing to the passivation
of the surface-active components of the S dots. The enlarged high-resolution
TEM images (Figure S2) indicate the high
crystallinity of the S and APE-S dots and a lattice spacing of 0.34
nm. Mutual intersection lattice fringes of 0.344/0.321 nm were observed
in the sulfur nanocrystals. The intersecting angle of the lattice
fringes was approximately 120°, corresponding to a (026)/(040)
plane and reflecting the well-defined crystalline structure of sulfur.

the S dots (A) and APE-S dots (B).

UV–vis spectroscopy was used to characterize the optical
properties of the obtained S dots and APE-S dots (Figure 3A). The UV–visible spectra
of the S dots and the APE-S dots in 200–400 nm showed a clear
peak at approximately 220 nm, which may be attributed to the n →
σ* transitions, indicating the formation of nanodots.21Figure 3B is the FL spectra of pristine-assembled particles S dots
(black) and the APE-S dots (red). The inset of Figure 3B is the enlarged FL spectrum of the S dots.
Our results indicate that the FL intensity of the APE-S dots was considerably
dependent on the usage of the injected Cu2+. Figure 3C shows the FL spectra (excited
at 365 nm) of the APE-S dots in an aqueous solution synthesized by
subsequent heating for 2 h after precipitation with various amounts
of Cu2+ (0.1–1.0 mM). With the increasing amount
of Cu2+, the FL intensity of the APE-S dots increased from
0.1 to 0.6 mM and then decreased gradually. This could be attributed
to the more effective etching of the surface polysulfide species,
which reduced the nonradiative recombination rate through the surface
state and facilitated the radiation recombination channel. The decrease
in FL intensity from 0.6 to 1.0 mM may be attributed to the over-etching
of the S dots.

(0.1–1.0 mM); inset denotes the histogram of FL intensity vs
different Cu2+ concentrations. (D) FL spectra of the APE-S
dots under different excitation wavelengths from 320 to 450 nm.

The full width at half-maximum of the emission
spectrum with respect
to the APE-S dots etched with various amounts of Cu2+ (0.1–1.0
mM) remained almost unchanged at approximately 85 nm, indicating that
the APE-S dots have a uniform and stable size distribution. Furthermore,
the APE-S dots showed an excitation-dependent emission, with the peak
shifting toward longer wavelength (from 425 to 525 nm) when the excitation
wavelength was varied from 320 to 450 nm in Figure 3D, consistent with a previously conducted
study.21,22 Along with the change in FL intensity of
the APE-S dots with various amounts of Cu2+, a surface
etching mechanism is proposed to explain the formation of the APE-S
dots.

The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) radiation measurements
were
conducted on pure PEG 400, the S dots, and the APE-S dots to study
any possible surface interactions between the S dots and the APE-S
dots. The bands at 2880 and 1452 cm–1 correspond
to the stretching vibrations of C–H and C–H bending,
respectively. The band at 938 cm–1 can be related
with the stretching vibration of O–H. A decrease in intensity
can be observed at 1290 and 1243 cm–1 in the S dots
and the APE-S dots, which are the characteristic peaks of PEG 400.
The peaks at 1138 and 1452 cm–1 in PEG 400 overlap
to obtain a broader band at 1395 cm–1 in the S dots
and the APE-S dots, which is in accordance with a previously conducted
research. No other additional new peaks could be observed in either
the S dots or the APE-S dots, suggesting that there were no significant
changes.

The time-resolved FL decays were measured and presented
in Figure 4B to obtain
insights
with respect to the reasons behind the improved FL QY. Although the
FL decay of the S dots and the APE-S dots could be fitted by two exponential
functions, the lifetime of the APE-S dots (2.58 ns) is observed to
be shorter than that of the S dots (6.35 ns) (Table 1). The average FL lifetime of the S dots
is longer than that of the APE-S dots, indicating a high amount of
surface states in the pristine S dots. After etching with Cu2+, the long-lived FL lifetime τ1 considerably decreased
from 62.4 to 2.55 ns, whereas τ2 decreased slightly
from 4.06 to 2.53 ns (Table 1). On the contrary, no significant change could be observed
with respect to the percentage of long- and short-lived FL lifetimes
according to the nonradiative ratio between the S dots and the APE-S
dots. Furthermore, a reduction in nonradiative pathways could be observed
after etching with Cu2+. The results were highly consistent
with those presented via TEM, which further indicated that the FL
enhancement can be attributed to the surface etching of the pristine
S dots.

the S dots and APE-S dots, and the XPS spectra of the S dots (C) and

APE-S dots	2.58	2.55 (36.34%)	2.53 (63.66%)	
X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) measurements were performed for
conducting the surface elemental analysis of the S dots and the APE-S
dots. The S 2p spectrum could be deconvoluted into two peaks at 161.68
and 162.87 eV in case of the S dots (Figure 4C), whereas the four sub-peaks at 161.87,
162.48, 163.10, and 163.90 eV in case of the APE-S dots could be attributed
to atomic sulfur (Figure 4C). Meanwhile, the binding energies at 166.11, 167.79, 168.70,
and 169.16 eV were attributed to SO2–(2p3/2), SO2–(2p1/2), SO3–(2p3/2), and SO3–(2p1/2), respectively. This
phenomenon was also observed for the APE-S dots at 166.52, 167.93,
168.24, and 169.10 eV, verifying the presence of similar S bonding
characteristics for these two nanodots. The amount of SO2–(2p1/2) and SO3–(2p1/2) with respect to the S dots are 36.99 and 13.78%,
respectively. The corresponding amounts in case of the APE-S dots
are 24.25 and 23.80%, respectively. When compared with the S dots,
the amount of SO2–(2p1/2)
and SO3–(2p1/2) in the APE-S
dots decreased and increased, respectively. The XPS results clearly
indicate a significant change in the chemical nature of the S dots
after etching and oxidation using Cu2+.

Conclusions
In this study, we have explored a facile post-synthetic Cu2+-assisted precipitation etching approach to prepare high-FL-QY
APE-S dots. This is presumably caused by the effective etching of
the APE-S dot surface states using Cu2+ and the consequent
suppression of the nonradiative recombination transitions. The APE-S
dots exhibit excellent FL activity, low toxicity, and excellent solubility
and can be extensively applied to bioimaging. Furthermore, they are
developed to satisfy the novel requirements associated with the next-generation
green nanomaterials. Even though the exact mechanism remains unclear,
it is reasonable to believe that the precipitation etching approach
introduces a new kind of surface state in the metal-free element,
offering considerable scientific insights with respect to the FL enhancement
mechanism of the metal-free elemental nanomaterials.

Experimental
Section
Reagents and Materials
The sublimated sulfur powder
was purchased from the Wenzhou chemical plant. Polyethylene glycol
400 (PEG-400) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Shanghai, China).
Copper nitrate was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.
Ultrapure water was obtained from the aquaplore ultrapure water system.
Sodium hydroxide was obtained from Jiangyin Jianghua microelectronic-material-incorporated
company. All of the chemicals were of analytical grade and were used
without further purification.

Instrument
The
UV-lamp photographs were obtained using
Ultraviolet Analyzer (ZF-1, Qiwei, Hangzhou, China). The product morphologies
were characterized by TEM (JEM-2100F) at 200 KV. The time-resolved
FL decay curves were recorded on HORIBA-FM-2015. The absolute FL QY
was determined on a FL3 (Edinburgh Instruments) spectrometer equipped
with an integrating sphere, and the FT-IR spectra were collected using
the Thermo Scientific Nicolet 6700 spectrometer.

Synthesis of
the APE-S Dots Etched Using Cu2+
The sublimated
sulfur powder (1.4 g), PEG-400 (3 mL), sodium hydroxide
(4.0 g), and 50 mL of ultrapure water were mixed and were subjected
to a reaction at 70 °C under continuous stirring, which is similar
to the synthesis method reported by Shen et al.23 After 72 h, the as-obtained products were referred to as
“S dots.” When Cu2+ was not used after the
synthesis, the resulting nonetching S dots expressed poor luminescence
with irregular spectra and weak intensity under 365 nm UV light radiation.
However, intense blue emission could be observed under the UV light
when Cu2+ was added into the S dot solution. S dots (1.5
mL) were mixed with 0.6 mmol of Cu2+ containing different
amounts of substances (0.1–1.0 mmol) in a round bottom flask
at 70 °C for 2 h under vigorous stirring. After filtration, the
mixture became light yellow, which differed from the normally observed
deep yellow color, and the products were referred to as the APE-S
dots.
