SHP2
(Src homology
2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2; PTPN11) is a ubiquitous
multidomain, nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) that plays
an important role in diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and Noonan
syndrome (NS). NS is one of the most common genetic disorders associated
with congenital heart disease, and approximately half of the patients
with Noonan syndrome have gain-of-function mutations in SHP2. One
of the most common NS mutations is N308D. The activity of SHP2, like
that of most PTPs, is reversibly inactivated by reactive oxygen species
(ROS). However, the molecular basis of this inactivation and the consequences
of NS-related mutations in PTPN11 on ROS-mediated inhibition are poorly
understood. Here, we investigated the mechanistic and structural details
of the reversible oxidation of the NS variant SHP2N308D. We show that SHP2N308D is more sensitive to oxidation
when compared with wild-type SHP2. We also show that although the
SHP2N308D catalytic domain can be reactivated by dithiothreitol
as effectively as the wild-type, full-length SHP2N308D is
only poorly reactivated by comparison. To understand the mechanism
of oxidation at a molecular level, we determined the crystal structure
of oxidized SHP2N308D. The structure shows that the catalytic
Cys459 residue forms a disulfide bond with Cys367, which confirms
that Cys367 functions as the “backdoor” cysteine in
SHP2. Together, our data suggest that the reversible oxidation of
SHP2 contributes negligibly, if at all, to the symptoms associated
with NS.

Introduction
SHP2 (Src homology 2 domain-containing
protein tyrosine phosphatase
2; PTPN11) is a ubiquitous multidomain, nonreceptor protein tyrosine
phosphatase (PTP)1 that contains two regulatory
SH2 domains [N-SH2 (residues 1–103) and C-SH2 (residues 112–216)]
and a PTP domain (residues 221–524). The SHP2 PTP domain includes
the structural features required for catalysis, including the PTP
loop with the requisite catalytic cysteine residue, the WPD loop that
is required for substrate hydrolysis, the Q-loop, the substrate-binding
loop, and the E-loop. The activity of SHP2 is regulated by an intramolecular
allosteric interaction between the SH2 and PTP domains.2,3 In the absence of phosphotyrosine (pTyr) docking sites created by
receptor activation, SHP2 is not active. This is because the SH2 domains
associate directly with the PTP domain and occlude the active site.4 However, receptor activation results in the generation
of biphosphorylated tyrosine sequences that bind the SHP2 SH2 domains,
which results in the dissociation of the SH2 domains from the PTP
domain. This renders the SHP2 catalytic site accessible, resulting
in substrate binding and dephosphorylation.

SHP2 has multiple
biological functions, including the regulation
of signaling pathways, especially the RAS/ERK signaling pathway that
is downstream of most growth factors, cytokines, and integrins.5−7 Mutations in PTPN11 are correlated with approximately 50% of Noonan
syndrome (NS) cases.8 NS is a congenital
autosomal dominant disorder, affecting 1:1000 to 1:2500 live births,
characterized by short stature, short neck, facial dysmorphia, pulmonary
valve stenosis, congenital heart defects, variable coagulation defects,
and lymphatic dysplasias.9 The most common
NS variant is N308D, which leads to an increase in SHP2 activity (hyperactive
SHP2),10 and is hypothesized to be mediated
by a destabilization of the autoinhibited “closed” state.
It has also been shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are
important mediators of cell growth, differentiation, and signaling,
regulate SHP2 activity by reversible inactivation11−13 and that this
is achieved through the formation of a disulfide bond between the
catalytic cysteine (Cys459) and one of two potential “backdoor”
cysteines (Cys333 or Cys367). Further, the same group identified the
formation of a backdoor–backdoor disulfide following H2O2-mediated oxidation in the presence of Cys459,
leading to a model in which the stably oxidized form of SHP2 consists
of a reduced catalytic cysteine and a stable backdoor–backdoor
disulfide. It is not known if or how this redox regulation is altered
in PTPN11 variants correlated with NS.

Results and Discussion
We used biochemistry and structural biology to determine how the
NS variant SHP2N308D is differentially regulated by ROS.
To understand how the presence of the SH2 domains affects oxidation
and reactivation susceptibility, we examined both the catalytic domain
in isolation (SHP2cat; aa 237–529; Figure 1A) and within the context of
both SH2 domains (SHP21–526; Figure 1B). To determine the relative activities
of the wild-type (WT) SHP2 and the SHP2N308D variants,
we first measured their catalytic activities using para-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) as a substrate. Consistent
with previous data, the presence of the SH2 domains, which block the
SHP2 active site in the absence of phosphorylated peptides, dramatically
reduces the activity of SHP2, as SHP21–526 is ∼70-fold
less active than the catalytic domain alone (Table 1). However, although the catalytic efficiency
of the NS variant, SHP2cat,N308D, is about 40% lower than
that of WT SHP2cat, this difference is reversed for the
SH2-containing constructs, i.e., the SHP21–526,N308D variant is about 4-fold more active than WT (SHP21–526). This increase in catalytic activity of the N308D mutant is consistent
with what has been observed in vivo;14,15 namely, that
the SHP2 NS variant N308D results in enhanced enzymatic activity,
leading to the increased activation in the RAS/ERK pathway that is
associated with the pathogenesis of NS.14

incubated without H2O2. (E, F) The ability of
oxidized SHP2 variants (E, SHP2237-529; F, SHP21–526) to be subsequently reactivated was determined
by measuring the activities of reduced (no H2O2) and oxidized (15 min incubation with 500 μM H2O2 prior to activity measurements) SHP2 samples in the
presence of the indicated concentrations of DTT. The % reactivation
was calculated by normalizing the activities of the oxidized samples
to the corresponding reduced samples. ±SE, n = 3–4. Two-way ANOVA test, with ****p <

The prevailing hypothesis is that
the N308D mutation destabilizes
the interaction between the SH2 and catalytic domains (N308 is located
at the interface of these two domains), leading to enhanced activity
due to increased access to the SHP2 active site. We therefore asked
if this putative increased access to the active site also confers
differential susceptibility of SHP2N308D to reversible
oxidation. To test this, we determined the oxidation profile of both
WT SHP2 and the NS variant SHP2 N308D upon exposure to H2O2. As can be seen in Figure 1C,D, both the N308D variants (SHP2cat,N308D and SHP21–526,N308D) are more sensitive to oxidation
than their WT counterparts. Namely, H2O2 inhibits
SHP2cat,N308D with an IC50 of 38 μM, whereas the
same H2O2 concentration has essentially no effect
on its WT counterpart (Figure 1C, Table 1).
A similar difference in H2O2 sensitivity is
observed for the SH2-containing constructs, with H2O2 inhibiting the activity of SHP21–526,N308D with an IC50 of 108 μM, whereas the same H2O2 concentration has no effect on its WT counterpart (Figure 1D, Table 1). Thus, both SHP21–526,N308D and SHP2cat,N308D are more sensitive to oxidation than
their WT SHP2 counterparts, with the catalytic domain construct (SHP2cat,N308D) being the most sensitive.

We then tested the
ability of the N308D variants to be reactivated
with DTT after a 15 min oxidation with 500 μM H2O2. We observed a striking difference in the ability of the
NS variants to be reactivated upon the addition of reductant; namely,
although the activity of SHP2cat,N308D recovers its activity
as effectively as its WT counterpart (SHP2cat; Figure 1E), the SH2-containing
variant does not and instead achieves only a 66% recovery in activity
(Figure 1F). Thus,
although both SHP21–526,N308D and SHP2cat,N308D are more sensitive to oxidation by H2O2 compared
to their WT counterparts, only the catalytic domain is able to achieve
WT-levels of reactivation; SHP21–526,N308D is not.
This suggests that the N308D variant of SHP2 is not only more sensitive
to oxidation by ROS, but it is also less effectively reactivated,
at least by DTT. Thus, under conditions which lead to high concentrations
of ROS, SHP2N308D would be expected to be less active and
its activity recovered less effectively than its WT counterpart.

To gain further insights into the molecular basis of the reversible
oxidation, we determined the crystal structure of oxidized SHP21–526,N308D to 2.5 Å. As SHP21–526,N308D is highly susceptible to oxidation, oxidized SHP21–526,N308D was formed by omitting reducing agents in the protein buffer prior
to crystal formation. The electron density maps were well defined
for the entirety of the protein molecule with the exception of five
short loops. Like all previous structures of SHP2, oxidized SHP21–526,N308D is in the closed state, with the SH2 domains
directly occluding the catalytic site (Figure 2A,B). The oxidized SHP21–526,N308D structure also contains three ordered phosphate molecules, two of
which bind the phosphotyrosine recognition pockets in the SH2 domains.
Unexpectedly, the third phosphate binds a pocket near the PTP active
site, at a position that is very nearly continuous with the hydroxyl
of Tyr279 (this residue defines the depth of the PTP active site; Figure 2C). Previous studies
have shown that Tyr279 is phosphorylated in an Abl-kinase-dependent
manner and functions to downregulate SHP2-dependent ERK signaling.16 Our structure shows that Tyr279 phosphorylation
may function to stabilize the closed state, which would lead to a
decrease in SHP2 activity and SHP2-dependent ERK signaling, as the
bound phosphate ion is coordinated by residues from both the N-terminal
SH2 domain (Asp61, Tyr62) and the catalytic PTP domain (Tyr279, Arg278,
and Ser460) (Figure 2C).

Figure 2 Oxidized SHP21–526,N308D results in the formation
of a disulfide bond between the catalytic cysteine, Cys459, and the
backdoor cysteine, Cys367. (A) Structure of oxidized SHP21–526 (SH2N, cyan; SH2C, blue; CAT, orange). The

sticks and boxed. (B) Expanded view of the area boxed in (A). PTP
loop (purple), N308D (magenta), Tyr279 (orange), Cys367 (pink), and
catalytic cysteine Cys459 (purple) are shown as sticks. (C) View similar
to (B), but highlighting the residues that coordinate the bound phosphate
ion (shown as sticks and labeled; residues in cyan belong to the SH2N domain, whereas the rest are from the catalytic domain).

The structure of oxidized SHP21–526,N308D closely
resembles that obtained under reducing conditions (PDB ID 4NWF; root-mean-square
deviation of 0.58 Å over 471 residues; Figure 3A).17 However,
the structures are not identical. In oxidized SHP2N308D, the catalytic Cys459 side chain rotates out of the PTP pocket by
nearly 90° to form an intramolecular disulfide bond with Cys367
(Figure 3B). Thus,
this structure confirms that the mechanism by which SHP2 achieves
reversible oxidation is via the formation of a disulfide bond between
its catalytic cysteine and a backdoor cysteine (and not by forming
a cyclic sulphenamide with the immediate C-terminal Ser residue, Ser460,
which has been observed in other PTPs, such as PTP1B18,19). Further, the structure reveals that the identity of the backdoor
cysteine in SHP2 is Cys367. Although Chen et al. observed the existence
of a reduced catalytic cysteine (Cys459) and the formation of a backdoor–backdoor
disulfide bond following treatment with H2O2, we see no evidence of such a backdoor–backdoor (Cys333–Cys367)
disulfide. Rather, oxidized SHP21–526,N308D is defined
by a disulfide bond formed between the catalytic Cys459 and the backdoor
Cys367 cysteines.

changes

of residues Cys459 and Cys367 refined at an occupancy of 1.0, with
γS atoms omitted. (C) Close-up of the residues that mediate
SHP2 reversible oxidation: Cys459 and Cys367. Arrows highlight the
small conformational changes observed in the PTP loop, the E-loop,
and the WPD loop (labeled).

Disulfide bond formation results in distinct structural changes
between the oxidized and reduced states (Figure 3C). First, in spite of disulfide bond formation,
the structure of the PTP loop (458HCSAGIR465) is essentially unchanged in the oxidized versus reduced structure.
The only significant conformational difference in this loop is the
position of the Cα atom of Cys459 in the oxidized structure.
Specifically, the Cα atom shifts ∼1.9 Å away from
its corresponding position in the reduced structure to accommodate
disulfide bond formation. Second, and in contrast to the PTP loop,
whose changes are highly localized, both the E-loop (357TKEVERGKSKCVKY370, which includes
the backdoor cysteine, Cys367) and to some extent the WPD loop (422TWPDHGVP429) shift away from the catalytic site
as rigid bodies to accommodate disulfide bond formation. The maximum
shift of both loops is ∼1.2 Å. Thus, disulfide bond formation
is readily achieved in SHP2 with only minor changes in the overall
conformation of the structure. Consistent with this, the position
of the N308D mutation is identical between the oxidized and reduced
structures.

Taken together, our data shows that both SHP2cat,N308D and SHP21–526,N308D are more susceptible
to oxidation
than WT SHP2 and furthermore that oxidized SHP21–526,N308D is comparatively resistant to reactivation by DTT. This suggests
that under oxidizing conditions, the NS mutant is less active than
WT and that its reactivation is less effective. This would result
in an overall reduction in SHP2 activity for the N308D mutant compared
to that in WT. Notably, this is the opposite of what is observed for
NS mutants. Namely, NS variants exhibit increased SHP2 activities.17,20 Together, these data suggest that the reversible oxidation of SHP2
contributes negligibly, if at all, to the symptoms associated with
NS. Our data also provide the first structural evidence for disulfide-mediated
protection of SHP2 against irreversible oxidation. In our structure,
Cys459 forms a disulfide bond with Cys367; no evidence is observed
for a Cys333–Cys367 bond. Coupled with the observation that
the γS atoms of C459 and C333 are separated by >8 Å,
our
data shows that Cys367 plays a dominant role over Cys333 in protecting
Cys459 from irreversible oxidation.

Experimental Section
Expression
and Purification
DNA coding the full length and the catalytic domain of SHP2 residues [1–526
and 237–526 (SHP2cat), respectively] were subcloned
into RP1B and pNIC28, respectively, as previously described.21 Site-directed mutagenesis was used to create
the N308D variant (Agilent Genomics). For protein expression, plasmid
DNAs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) RIL cells (Agilent). Cells were grown in Luria broth
in the presence of selective antibiotics at 37 °C to an OD600 of ∼0.8, and the expression was induced by the addition
of 1 mM isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside. Induction proceeded
for ∼20 h at 18 °C prior to harvesting by centrifugation
at 7647g (15 min, 4 °C). Cell pellets were stored
at −80 °C until purification.

Cell pellets were
resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM
NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100) and lysed using high-pressure
homogenization (Avestin C3 EmulsiFlex). The lysate was cleared by
centrifugation (40905g, 45 min,
4 °C). The supernatant was filtered and loaded onto
a Ni-NTA column equilibrated in buffer A (50 mM Tris–HCl pH
8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole). Protein was eluted using buffer
B (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole). The
elution was incubated with tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease overnight
at 4 °C in dialysis buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 100
mM NaCl). The TEV protease, cleaved His6-tag, and uncleaved
protein were removed using a second IMAC step. Final purification
was achieved using size exclusion chromatography [SEC; Superdex 75
26/60 (GE Healthcare)] equilibrated in analysis buffer (50 mM Hepes
pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl). All experiments were performed in analysis buffer.

Determination of PTPase Catalytic Rates Using pNPP as a Substrate
The PTPase activity of SHP2cat, SHP2cat,N308D (0.25 μM), and SHP21–526,N308D (5 μM)
was determined by first incubating protein with pNPP at different
concentrations (0, 50, 100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000
μM) for 30 min at 30 °C. Next, the reactions were stopped
with 100 μL of 1 M NaOH and the absorbance of pNPP 405 nm then measured using a microplate spectrophotometer (BioTek).
The PTPase rates were calculated using the molar extinction coefficient
of pNPP of 18 000 M–1 cm–1.

Inactivation of SHP2 Variants by H2O2
To measure the susceptibility of the SHP2
variants to oxidation,
SHP21–526, SHP21–526,N308D, SHP2cat, and SHP2cat,N308D (20 μM) were incubated
with different concentrations of H2O2 (0, 3.2,
8, 16, 32, 60, 80, 160, 320, 400, 1000, and 2000 μM) for 15
min at room temperature. Each reaction was incubated with analysis
buffer for 10 min at room temperature. pNPP (2000
μM; 15 μL) was then added and the reactions incubated
at 30 °C for an additional 15 min. The reactions were then stopped
with 1 M NaOH and the absorbance of pNPP 405 nm measured
using a microplate spectrophotometer (BioTek). The PTPase rates were
calculated using the molar extinction coefficient of pNPP of 18 000 M–1 cm–1. The extent of remaining activity was normalized to the sample incubated
without H2O2.

Reactivation Experiments
To analyze the ability of
DTT to reverse the H2O2-mediated oxidation of
SHP2 variants, 1.6 μM SHP21–526/SHP21–526,N308D and 0.6 μM SHP2cat/SHP2cat,N308D were
incubated with or without 500 μM H2O2 for
15 min at room temperature. Five microliters (80 nM SHP2FL and 30 nM SHP2cat) of these reactions were then incubated
in 95 μL of buffer containing 100 μM DiFMUP in the absence
or presence of 0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, and 6 mM DTT for 30 min
at room temperature. The fluorescence intensity was then measured
in the Synergy Epoch using an excitation filter of 340/40 and emission
filter of 460/40. The recovered activities were determined by normalizing
to the samples with 10 mM DTT and without H2O2.

Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using SigmaPlot
12.5 or Graph Pad Prism 6. The statistics for steady-state data was
performed using unpaired t-test (SigmaPlot 13.0),
with significance of p < 0.05 or by a two-way
ANOVA analysis using Prism Graph Pad 6, with significance of p < 0.05.

Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure
Determination
SHP21–526,N308D was crystallized
in 0.2 M sodium
phosphate pH 9.1, 20% (w/v) poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) 3350 using
the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 4 °C. Crystals were
cryoprotected in 0.18 M sodium phosphate pH 9.1, 18% (w/v) PEG 3350,
20% (v/v) glycerol (direct soak, 1 min) prior to diffraction screening
and data collection. Crystallographic data was collected at Brookhaven
National Laboratory National Synchroton Light Source (BNL-NSLS) Beamline
X25 at 100 K using an ADSC QUANTUM 315 CCD detector (Table 2). Crystallographic data were
indexed, scaled, and merged using HKL2000 0.98.692i.22 The structure of SHP21–526,N308D was
solved by molecular replacement using the program Phaser 1.3.223 and the structure of SHP21–527 T2K/F41L/F513S (PDB ID: 2SHP) as a search model, after omitting solvent molecules.
The resulting rotation- and translation-function Z-scores were 24.3 and 19.7 (molecule A) and 31.2 and 61.2 (molecule
B), respectively. The model was completed by cycles of manual building
using the program Coot 6.0.224 coupled
with structure refinement using RefMac 5.2.0019,25 with a final round of refinement using PHENIX.26 The structure of SHP21–526,N308D was determined to 2.50 Å resolution and refined to Rcryst = 19.5% and Rfree = 23.7% and contains 2 molecules of Shp2, 197 water molecules, and
4 phosphate molecules per asymmetric unit (SHP2 molecule A residues
1, 91–92, 157–162, 236–244, 298–299, 314–322,
and 526, and SHP2 molecule B residues 1, 91–92, 156–162,
236–244, 298–299, 314–323, and 526, were not
observed in the electron density map and so were not modeled). The
stereochemical quality of the model was analyzed using MolProbity,27 which performs Ramachandran plot, Cβ deviation,
and rotamer analyses. The agreement of the model to the diffraction
data was analyzed using SFCheck 7.2.02.28 Atomic coordinates and structure factors for SHP21–526,N308D have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank as entry 6ATD.
