In recent years, functional polymeric compounds have
been widely
used to modify the silica surface, which allows one to obtain the
corresponding organomineral composites for broad application prospects.
In this case, lignin—a cross-linked polyphenolic macromolecule—is
of great interest according to its valuable properties and possible
surplus as a by-product of pulp and paper industry and various biorefinery
processes. Hybrid materials based on kraft softwood lignin and silica
were obtained via the electrostatic attraction of oxidized lignin
to the aminosilica surface with different porosities, which were prepared
by the amination of the commercial silica gel with an average pore
diameter of 6 nm, and the silica prepared in the lab with the oxidized
kraft lignin and lignin–silica samples with an average pore
diameter of 38 nm was investigated by physicochemical methods: two-dimensional
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 31P NMR, Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis in nitrogen and
air atmosphere, scanning electron microscopy, and adsorption methods.
After oxidation, the content of carboxylic groups almost doubled in
the oxidized lignin, compared to that in the native one (0.74 mmol/g
against 0.44 mmol/g, respectively). The lignin content was deposited
onto the surface of aminosilica, depending on the porosity of the
silica material and on the content of amino groups on its surface,
giving lignin–aminosilica with 20% higher lignin content than
the lignin–aminosilica gel. Both types of lignin–silica
composites demonstrate a high sorptive capacity toward crystal violet
dye. The suggested approach is an easy and low-cost way of synthesis
of lignin–silica composites with unique properties. Such composites
have a great potential for use as adsorbents in wastewater treatment
processes.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Kraft lignin, one of the
major types of technical lignins, is a
biomacromolecule characterized by relatively low molecular weight,
variable functional group contents, high polydispersity, and by the
presence of some amount of thiol groups in the aliphatic chains.1−3 This type of technical lignin is obtained as a result of chemical
fragmentation and condensation reaction occurring during kraft pulping
processes.4 Kraft lignin is a prosperous
material for the development of well-designed biomaterials, biodegradable
films, and composites for potential industrial applications.4−10 The LignoBoost lignin process for partial removal of kraft lignin
from black liquor was developed by Innventia (Sweden) together with
Chalmers and has offered a pure from ash lignin material with reproducible
molecular weight characteristics for various commercial applications,
for example, in the building, construction, and automotive sectors,
where lignin offers sustainable alternatives for phenols in plywood
glues and other wood-based panels, and polyols used in foams.11,12

Despite the high content of functional groups in the lignin
structure,
lignin activation is needed to increase its solubility or reactivity
for the development of new functional materials.13 Oxidation of kraft lignin could be used to address both
the issues. Among different oxidizing agents, for example, nitric
acid,14 sodium periodate,15−19 metal oxides,20 nitrobenzene,20 and oxygen with catalysts,21 hydrogen peroxide is of greatest interest as it is common
and broadly available as an oxidizing agent in pulp industry.22 Recently, several works described lignin oxidation
by hydrogen peroxide under different conditions.22−24 It was reported
that temperature and pH play a crucial role in the oxidation process.
Adjustment of these parameters led to obtaining the controlled cracking
of lignin macromolecules and the needed degree of dearomatization
in the modified lignin. For instance, at moderate temperatures (80–160
°C), mono- and dicarboxylic acids are the main products of the
cracking reaction, with the yields of these products in the range
of 30–50% of initial lignin. A change in the acidity of the
reaction results in a change in the reaction mechanism and the product
distribution.23

It was proved that
the modified kraft lignin could be utilized
effectively as a component of organic–inorganic composites,
where the inorganic carrier would get the needed functionality and
the lignin macromolecule could improve its physicochemical characteristics
such as textural, morphological, thermal, and adsorptional abilities.15−19,25−31 Silica–lignin composites were obtained in the process of
aminated silica surface modification with an oxidized lignin solution.15,16,18,28 The synthesized materials were tested as sorbents for pollutant
removal from aqueous solutions.

In our previous paper, we discussed
the method of kraft lignin-based
hybrid material synthesis by the sol–gel method, where lignin
was activated by aminosilane for increasing its reactivity and possibility
to be involved into the created silica network.32 In the current paper, we present a simpler method for lignin
deposition on the silica surface, namely by coating aminated silica
with oxidized kraft lignin, where hydrogen peroxide was applied as
the oxidizing agent. To estimate the influence of the initial silica
structure on the thermal and structural characteristics of lignin–silica
hybrids, two types of silica, commercial silica gel and silica synthesized
from fumed silica, with different specific surface areas and pore
sizes were used.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials
LignoBoost (LB) softwood
kraft lignin, kindly supplied by a plant in Northern Europe, was used
in this study. The molecular weight of LB was approximately 5600 Da.32 Hydrogen peroxide (35%), glacial acetic acid,
ethanol, and 1,4-dioxane were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Silica
gel was purchased from Merck. The particle size for silica gel was
0.2–0.5 mm, whereas the pore average diameter was 6 nm. Silica
was obtained from fumed silica according to the procedure described
in ref (33). All the
chemicals were of reagent grade. Distilled water was used for aqueous
solution preparations.

2.2 Methods
2.2.1 Oxidation of Lignin
A 0.5 mL of
35% hydrogen peroxide water solution and 0.25 mL of glacial acetic
acid were added to lignin solution in the dioxane/water (4:1) mixture.
The mixture was heated at 50 °C for 35 min. After this time,
the mixture was cooled at room temperature. The solvents were evaporated
under reduced pressure. In order to evaporate water, EtOH was added
and then evaporated again. Brown oil was formed, which was washed
with distilled water two times (to remove acetic acid and hydrogen
peroxide). The sample was dried overnight at 55 °C. The Mass
yield of oxidized lignin (LB–COOH) was 350 mg.

2.2.2 Synthesis of Aminosilica
The synthesis
of aminosilica was conducted as described by Tertykh and Belyakova
(1991).34 Briefly, aminated silica/silica
gel (aminosilica/aminosilica gel) was obtained by the silica modification
with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane in the toluene medium. The content
of amino groups was 0.0020 and 0.0047 m2/g for the aminated
silica gel and silica, respectively.

2.2.3 Synthesis of Lignin–Silica Hybrid
Composites
LB–COOH (1 g) after washing was dissolved
in 50 mL of dioxane/water (4:1) mixture and then added to aminosilica
gel or aminosilica in the lignin/aminosilica gel mass ratios of 1:1
(LSG1) and 1:2 (LGS2) and the lignin/aminosilica mass ratios of 1:1
(LS1) and 1:2 (LS2) for 2 h (Table 1). The samples were filtered and washed two times by
dioxane and three times by water to remove the dioxane residues. The
samples were dried at 50 °C overnight in a vacuum oven.

2.3 Analysis
2.3.1 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
31P NMR; the content of functional groups in the lignin
samples was measured by 31P NMR.35 Approximately 20–30 mg of the lignin sample was weighed and
phosphitylated using 2-chloro-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane.
Endo-N-hydroxy-5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboximide (Sigma-Aldrich,
40 mg/mL) and chromium (III) acetylacetonate (Aldrich, 5 mg/mL) were
used as an internal standard and a relaxation reagent, respectively.
The derivatized sample was dissolved in CDCl3 prior to
analysis. The 31P NMR experiment was performed with a 90°
pulse angle, inverse-gated proton decoupling, and a delay time of
10 s. For analysis, 256 scans with a time delay of 6 s and a total
runtime of 34 min were collected. Measurements were performed in duplicate.

2.3.2 2D Heteronuclear Single-Quantum Coherence
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
Approximately 100 mg of the sample
was acetylated for better solubility36 The
residue was dissolved in 700 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6. The two-dimensional heteronuclear single-quantum
coherence (2D HSQC) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum was
acquired using the Bruker pulse program “hsqcetgpsi”,
with a relaxation delay of 1.7 s, a coupling constant of 145 Hz, an
INEPT transfer delay time of 1.72 ms (d4 = 1/4J), a spectral window of 10.5 ppm in F2 and
166 ppm in F1 with 1024 × 512 increments, 240
scans per increment, and a spectral center set at 90.0 ppm in F1 and 5.3 ppm in F2. The 2D NMR data set
was processed with 2k × 1k data points using a π/2-shifted
sine-bell window function in both dimensions. Central DMSO (δC/δH = 39.5/2.5 ppm) was used as an internal
reference according to the solvent adopted.

2.3.3 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
IR spectra were collected using a PerkinElmer spectrophotometer
[Spotlight 400 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) imaging system, Waltham,
MA, USA] equipped with a Spectac MKII Golden Gate system (Creekstone
Ridge, GA, USA). The samples were analyzed in the range of 600–4000
cm–1 with 16 scans at a 4 cm–1 resolution and a 1 cm–1 interval at room temperature.

2.3.4 Thermogravimetric Analysis
Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was carried out on a TGA/DSC 1 (Mettler Toledo) instrument
under the following operational conditions: heating rate of 10 °C
min–1, dynamic atmosphere of synthetic air or nitrogen
(50 mL min–1), temperature range of 30–900
°C, and sample mass of ∼2.5 mg.

2.3.5 Surface Area and Average Pore Size Measurements
The specific surface areas and pore volumes were determined from
the low-temperature nitrogen adsorption data (automatic sorption analyzer,
ASAP 2420, Micromeritics, USA). The samples were degassed at 77 K
before measurement.

2.3.6 Scanning Electron Microscopy
The
structural characteristics of the fabricated samples were studied
with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (S-4800, Hitachi,
Japan). The samples were coated with a 1 nm thick Pt–Pd layer
sputtered with a Cressington 208HR high-resolution coater.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Lignin Oxidation
Oxidation of lignin
consists of the oxidative cracking reaction involving the cleavage
of the lignin ring, aryl-ether bond, or other linkages within lignin.23 The distribution of the reaction product content
could vary according to the applied conditions to the oxidizing process.
It was shown by Xiang and Lee23 that 30–50%
yields of mono- and dicarboxylic acids as the main products of initial
lignin could be reached under strong alkaline conditions, which proceeds
even at low reaction temperatures (80–90 °C). Under acidic
conditions, 130–160 °C is required to attain the same
degree of cracking.

In our study LB kraft lignin was successfully
oxidized by hydrogen peroxide in acidic media under mild thermal conditions
(50 °C). As a result, the benzene rings in lignin macromolecules
were opened and transformed into carboxylate groups, resulting in
the formation of muconic acid-type structure (Figure 1).22,37−40

Figure 1 Scheme
of lignin oxidation in acidic conditions.

The number of phenolic, aliphatic hydroxyl groups,
and carboxyl
groups in the initial and oxidized LB was determined from the 31P NMR spectra (Figure 2) according to the method presented by Argyropoulos in ref (35). Table 2 shows the total content of functional groups
in the lignin samples before and after H2O2 oxidation.
The obtained results confirmed the oxidation of lignin, resulting
in the transformation of phenolic groups to carboxylic groups. The
number of carboxyl groups increased from 0.44 to 0.74 mmol/g after
oxidation. From the other side, the number of phenolic OH decreased
from 4.29 to 4.00 mmol/g.

kraft lignin and (b)
oxidized LB lignin.

The 2D HSQC NMR method also confirmed the changes
in the aromatic
structure and carboxyl content in lignin before and after oxidizing.
The appearance of intense signals at 1.9 (1H) and 20 ppm
(13C) in the 2D NMR spectra of oxidized lignin (Figure 3b), compared to the
initial one (Figure 3a), confirms the higher number of carboxylic groups in the modified
macromolecule. The signal in the range of 8.5–5.5 ppm (1H) and 135–100 ppm (13C) can be assigned
to the higher amount of aromatic units in the initial lignin than
that in the one after oxidizing (Figure 3), confirming the successful partial dearomatization
of lignin.41−43

Figure 3 2D NMR spectra of: (a) LB initial and (b) LB oxidized.

A significant increase in the content of carbonyl
group arising
from esters, acids, aldehydes, and so forth, as well as the decrease
in the intensity of the aromatic stretching bands in the region of
1400–1600 cm–1, was observed in the FTIR
spectrum of oxidized lignin presented in Figure 4. These observations are in line with the
others presented in the literature studies of lignin oxidation by
peroxides.41,44,45 The ionization state of carboxylic groups can be distinguished by
measuring the wavenumber separation (Δ) between the symmetric
and asymmetric vibrations. Thus, the low wavenumber separation (60
cm–1) in the absorption band between 1710 and 1650
cm–1 in the oxidized lignin sample LB-COOH corresponded
to the formation of nonionized carboxyl groups in lignin after the
oxidation of aromatic rings. After the oxidized lignin deposition
on the silica and silica gel surface, the Δ value was 140 cm–1. Such an increase in wavenumber separation confirmed
the intermolecular electrostatic interaction between the dissociated
carboxylic groups of oxidized lignin and protonated amino groups of
aminated silica or silica gel (Figure S1). The scheme of oxidized lignin on the silica/silica gel surface
is presented in Figure 5.

3.2 Synthesis of Lignin–Silica Composites
The synthesized silica and commercial silica gel were previously
modified with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane to obtain a positively
charged surface which will be able to interact with the dissociated
carboxyl groups of the oxidized kraft lignin. The concentration of
amino groups on the surfaces measured by acid/base titration was 0.67
and 0.56 mmol/g for silica gel and silica, respectively.

3.3 Characterization of Lignin–Silica Composites
TGA in nitrogen atmosphere was conducted in order to investigate
the thermal characteristics of the synthesized composites and compare
with the initial silicas and LB kraft lignin (Figure 6). The maximum moisture evaporation of LB
kraft lignin was found at 51 °C, whereas the maximum water evaporation
because of self-condensation reactions occurs at 184 °C (can
occur up to 400 °C). The β–β and C–C
linkages between the lignin monomeric units cleave at 275–350
°C, whereas the recombination of the formed radicals leads to
the formation of guaiacyl and syringyl compounds and the cleavage
of aryl ether bonds at 293 °C. At 390 °C conversion of phenols
into pyrocatechols and conversion of short substituents of the benzene
rings take place with further rearrangement of the backbone and carbonization
at a temperature higher than 400 °C. A comprehensive analysis
of the LB kraft lignin thermal decomposition is presented in our previous
work.32 It was found that the degradation
in the inert atmosphere of immobilized lignin occurred in the same
temperature range for all synthesized composites: from 200 to 580
°C, with the maximum at 416 and 404 °C for lignin–silica
gel composites and lignin–silica composites, respectively.
Difference was found in the moisture content of composites based on
the silica gel and silica, which, as could be seen from the TG plots,
refers to the type of silica as part of the composite.

Figure 6 TG (a,b) and differential
TG (DTG) (c,d) curves of thermal decomposition
in N2 atmosphere for original LB kraft lignin, silicas,
aminosilicas, and lignin–silica composites.

TGA in oxygen atmosphere led to estimate the concentration
of macromolecules
in the final composites. For this, the TG curves of the synthesized
composites, initial lignin, aminosilica (gel), and silica (gel) were
compared (Figure 7).
It was found that the content of lignin in the composites was 166
mg/g for LSG1, 161 mg/g for LSG2, 254 mg/g for LS1, and 124 mg/g for
LS2.

for original kraft lignin, silicas, aminosilicas, and lignin–silica
composites.

3.4 Textural Characteristics
Two different
silicas were applied to estimate and emphasize the influence of carriers
to the properties of the final composites. The main difference of
the used carriers is in the textural characteristics and particle
size. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms and pore size distribution
(PSD) curves obtained for all the studied materials are presented
in Figures 8 and 9. It is obvious that the isotherms and PSD by the
area and volume of silica gel (Figure 8a) and silica (Figure 8b) have quite divergent shapes. This indicates the
difference in the silica structure, which is preserved after each
step of modification.

Figure 8 Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms for (a) lignin–silica
gel composites, (b) lignin–silica composites and initial materials.

Figure 9 Pore size distribution by area and volume for (a) lignin–silica
gel composites, (b) lignin–silica composites and initial materials.

The isotherms of both types of materials are characterized
by the
visible hysteresis loops formed at intermediate (silica gel-based
materials) and high (silica-based materials) pressures, which confirm
the significant contributions of mesopores to their porosity. The
differences in the isotherm shape and the amount of nitrogen adsorbed
suggest the essential differences in the pore surface area, pore volume,
and pore diameter.46 According to PSD (Figures 9, S2), the porous structure of materials is also quite different.
For instance, PDSs for silicas and the corresponding aminosilicas
are almost the same. However, after the deposition of oxidized lignin
onto the carrier in a mass ratio of 1:1, the lowest size pores of
the carrier were probably blocked by lignin, according to the decrease
and slight shift of peaks with the maxima at 3.3 and 4.3 to 3.5 and
4.5 nm (Figure 9a),
respectively, and peaks with maxima at 3.3, 5.0, 6.3 to 2.0 and 6.5
nm (Figure 9b). In
case of the 1:2 lignin–silica gel composite, the range of PDS
was shifted to 8.7–25.6 nm with the maxima at 13.0 and 21.2
nm (pore area) and to 8.0–25.0 nm with the maxima at 12.7 and
21 nm (pore volume).

In Table 3, the
textural characteristics of the synthesized composites and initial
lignin, oxidized lignin, and silica are summarized. It was found that
the surface area decreased after each step of silica or silica gel
modification (Figure 8). Thus, the initial specific surface area [Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET)] of silica gel was 428 m2/g, which decreased up to
323 m2/g after amination and to 202.6–201.3 m2/g after oxidized lignin deposition. The same tendency was
observed for silica, where the initial specific surface area was 141.5;
it was 119.5 m2/g for aminosilica gel and 80.1–84.8
m2/g for the hybrids based on the silica and oxidized lignin.

LS1	80.1	89.0	0.825	37.1	
LS2	84.8	95.4	0.874	36.6	
Based on the data obtained from the TGA curves and
nitrogen adsorption/desorption
isotherms, the concentration of lignin per gram and square meter of
samples was calculated (Table 4). As it could be seen from the obtained data, the lignin
concentration in LSG1 and LSG2 is almost the same, which could confirm
reaching of the maximal lignin saturation on the silica gel surface.
In case of silica, where the pores are much larger (more than 6 times),
the surface capacity toward lignin macromolecules is higher. The higher
value of oxidized lignin adsorption on the aminosilica surface could
also be explained by the higher number of amino groups on the surface
compared to aminosilica gel.

Table 4 Lignin Concentration in Synthesized
Composites
sample	lignin concentration, mg/g	lignin concentration, mg/m2	
LSG1	166	0.82	
LSG2	161	0.80	
LS1	254	3.17	
LS2	124	1.46	
The size of the synthesized composite particles was
determined
from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Figure S3). It was found that the size of the particles of
hybrid composites based on commercial silica gel as the inorganic
carrier was 0.2–0.5 mm, as for the initial silica gel. The
samples based on prepared silica had a bigger average size of 0.4–1.0
mm and also refer to size of initial silica material.

3.5 Morphology
The morphologies of the
synthesized composites were characterized via SEM analysis. Figure 10 presents the surface
structures of the silica gel (Figure 10a–f) and silica (Figure 10g–l) coated by oxidized kraft lignin.
It could be observed from the SEM micrographs that the surface morphology
of composites based on one type of silica is quite similar; however,
the composites with lower lignin content have more regular surface,
which could be an evidence of more uniform kraft lignin deposition
and creation of monolayer on the support surface. Nevertheless, all
synthesized materials were characterized by the rough surface with
holes, which was also confirmed by the studied textural characteristics.

Figure 10 SEM
micrographs of LB–silica gel 1 (a–c), LB–silica
gel 2 (d–f), LB–silica 1 (g–i), and LB–silica
2 (j–l).

The synthesized composites were tested as sorbents
for the common
synthetic dye in textile production—crystal violet. As it could
be seen from the diagram (Figure 11), the capacity of LB–silica samples was higher
(108–110 mg/g) than that of LB–silica gel samples (90–95
mg/g) for the selected dye. The initial silica gel and silica have
showed activity for the crystal violet dye adsorption, but the capacity
was lower: 75 mg/g for silica gel and 100 mg/g for silica. Thus, the
obtained materials have high capacity toward the selected dye, which
confirmed the high potential of these composites as sorbents for the
treatment of the textile industry effluents as well as dye recovery
for further reuse.

the crystal
violet dye.

4 Conclusions
The synthesized lignin–aminosilica
composites contain up
to 20 wt % of lignin, proving that the developed approach is efficient
for lignin deposition on charged silica surfaces. The concentrations
of the amino groups on the silica surface, as well as the pore sizes
and volume, play an important role for lignin deposition. In case
of larger pores (silica-based samples), lignin seems to be adsorbed
as spherical particles, whereas on silica gel materials, with more
narrow pores and higher surface areas, lignin seems to form a uniformly
distributed thin and flat layer. The adsorption capacity of immobilized
lignin toward crystal violet dye was found to be relatively high and
the capacity of initial silicas and lignin expanded greatly. This
can be explained by the more “extended” conformation
of lignin with a better accessibility of various functional groups,
when it is adsorbed on the surface of charged silica materials. The
developed lignin–aminosilica composite materials may have great
potential for the removal of dyes from wastewater in a textile industry.
