The
use of metal-oxide sensors for effectively detecting hydrogen sulfide
(H2S) gas at room temperature is currently hindered by
their inadequate sensitivity and selectivity. Using a lucid fabrication
strategy, we report a room-temperature, highly sensitive, and selective
H2S gas sensor using NiO-modified WO3 nanorod
(one-dimensional–one-dimensional) random networks. The observed
improvements in gas-sensing sensitivity stem from the synergistic
effects of various contributions inside the sensing heterostructure,
such as bulk nanorod, p–n heterojunction at the interface of
these two dissimilar oxides, and gas-induced conducting species due
to sulfurization (WS2–x and NiS1–x). An in situ impedance measurement
during gas exposure was used to investigate the influence of these
effects. The analysis revealed that these contributing factors can
be either cooperating or competing and lead to either increased or
decreased sensitivity, respectively. The presence of semimetallic
species (NiS, WS2) was further confirmed by in situ X-ray
diffraction analysis of the heterostructure nanorod sample with H2S gas exposure. The related sensing mechanism in the heterostructures
is presented with a conduction pathway model. The room-temperature-operated
nanorod heterostructure sensors showed a lower detection limit of
H2S at ∼0.5 ppm, which is significantly lower than
its toxicity limiting value ∼10 ppm, per the Environmental
Protection Agency. The nanorod heterostructure sensors can be used
for real-time, low-cost, room-temperature alarms in an H2S monitoring system.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a highly toxic and flammable gas that is widely produced
in coal mines and oil industries and used in sewerage pipe detection.
Upon exposure, this gas affects the human nervous system and can become
life threatening at high concentrations. The effects of H2S exposure at 2 ppm include nausea, headaches, or loss of sleep;
at 20 ppm, fatigue and headache; and between 50 and 100 ppm, respiratory
tract irritation, digestive upset, and loss of appetite.1 Therefore, accurately detecting H2S in both laboratories and human living places is essential.

H2S typically has a rotten-egg odor, which can be detected
by humans at concentrations as low as 0.5 ppb. This odor threshold
concentration is much lower than the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration ceiling point (20 ppm),1,2 but olfactory
fatigue occurs at continuous low-concentration inhalation as well
as at high concentrations. Because human odor-level detection is not
a reliable method for effectively detecting H2S in atmosphere,
there is a demand for a highly efficient, low-cost H2S
gas sensor operable at room temperature for continuous monitoring
in various workplaces to ensure employee safety.

Recently, various
quasi one-dimensional (1D) metal-oxide semiconductor nanostructures
(e.g., nanorods, nanowires, nanotubes, nanobelts) of various binary
oxides have been found to be promising materials for gas sensing.
Compared with traditional thin-film technology, the advantages of
1D nanostructures include higher surface-to-volume ratio, good stability,
excellent crystallinity, and excellent signal transduction in the
presence of gaseous species for their less defective structures.3 It is argued that better sensitivity can be achieved
with n-type 1D metal oxides through the modulation of initial resistance
in background air. This can be realized when various surface oxygen
species (O2–, O–, O2–) have been adsorbed on a simple oxide surface and
depleted the electrons by creating a surface depletion potential width
(λD). These adsorbed oxygen species further shrink
the actual electron conduction diameter (the nondepleted core inside
the nanorod, Dcond ∼ D – 2λD, where D is the actual
diameter) due to the surface depletion region. In addition, the heterojunction
of two dissimilar oxides with different work functions could create
a larger depletion area at the interface of two dissimilar oxides,
which eventually enhances the initial resistance. The conduction pathway
is modulated by the coverage of second oxides on the surface of the
host oxides, catalytic nature, work function difference, and the thickness
of the second oxide. In addition, heterostructures can remarkably
improve the selectivity by optimizing the mixing ratio between dissimilar
oxides.

WO3 has been investigated as a sensing material
for H2S in recent years. Pure WO3 films and
noble metal-decorated WO3 nanomaterials have been reported
for H2S sensing. Granqvist and his group produced nanocrystalline
WO3 films using the advanced gas deposition method. After
sintering at 750 K, the WO3 film sensor exhibited extremely
high sensitivity toward H2S at room temperature. This good
response is due to the formation of tetragonal phase through sintering,
but the detailed sensing mechanism remains unclear.4−6 Kim and his
co-worker investigated the CH4 and H2S gas-sensing
properties of pristine or Au nanoparticles-doped WO3 nanowires
at a high operating temperature. The increased sensitivity was attributed
to the catalytic effect of the Au nanoparticles. The slower response
time was caused by some delayed reactions in relation to the Au nanoparticles.7

One drawback of the traditional metal-oxide
semiconductor gas sensor is its high operating temperature, which
leads to high power consumption and limits the lifetime of the sensor.
Hence, there is a need to investigate sensing performance at room
temperature. Sensing performance can be improved when semiconductor
metal oxides form heterojunctions with other oxides, especially different
types of metal oxides.8 These modifications
can substantially change the surface properties as well as the electronic
properties because they enhance the depletion layer at the heterointerfaces.
A heterojunction will form at the boundaries between two dissimilar
materials; once the electrical contact at the interface is formed,
the electrons at the higher energy level will flow across the interface
to the lower-level states to equilibrate the Fermi energy levels.

The H2S gas-sensing properties of metal-oxide heterostructures
have been reported by many researchers over the past few years. Wang
et al. synthesized 1D nanosized core–shell CuO–SnO2 nanomaterials using the hydrothermal method. The p–n
junctions are formed from p-type CuO nanoparticles uniformly coated
on the n-type SnO2 nanorods. The gas sensor based on these
p–n junction nanomaterials indicated good sensitivity and selectivity
against H2S gas at 60 °C.9 Gupta et al. demonstrated an H2S gas sensor based on
randomly distributed nano p–n junction between CuO and WO3.10 Modification of a WO3 thin film with CuO resulted in enhanced sensitivity toward H2S (sensitivity of 53 400% toward 10 ppm H2S at 300 °C).

Lee et al. investigated the H2S sensing properties of CuO-functionalized WO3 nanowires
at 300 °C.11 The enhanced gas-sensing
property of these p–n junction nanomaterials is likely the
result of two factors: (1) The p–n junctions formed at the
grain boundaries of p-type CuO, and n-type SnO2/WO3 resulted in a potential barrier. The barrier blocked the
electrons transporting through the nanomaterials, which increased
the initial resistance of the sensors in air. (2) The formation of
metallic CuS due to the interaction of CuO with H2S resulted
in a drastic decrease in the resistance of these sensors.

In
addition, Zhou et al. prepared CuO–NiO core–shell microspheres
using the simple two-step hydrothermal method.12 At the optimal operating temperature of 260 °C, the
gas sensors displayed the highest sensitivity of 460% toward 100 ppm
H2S gas. The improved response is due to the catalytic
effect of NiO shell and the formation of heterojunctions at the boundaries
between NiO and CuO, which resulted in a higher number of adsorbed
oxygen molecules on the surface.

Few studies have explored the
sulfurization reaction on the NiO or WO3 surface during
H2S gas sensing, especially at room temperature. Considering
that the work function of NiO is 9.4 eV, which is higher than that
of CuO (8.5 eV), the large work function difference between NiO and
WO3 may provide a broader depletion area formed at the
heterojunction interface and lead to a larger resistance change during
gas sensing. It could be deduced that the combination of 1D NiO and
WO3 nanostructures could potentially boost H2S gas-sensing performance at room temperature.

In the recent
literature, various 1D–1D heterostructures have been reported
for efficient gas sensing, including zero-dimensional oxide-coated
1D structures, brush-like 1D–1D composite, and coaxial 1D–1D
core–shell oxide composites with various fabrication processes
using electrospinning, thermal evaporation, hydrothermal, and atomic
layer deposition.13−18 These processes are time consuming, expensive, and power hungry,
and thus there is a demand to process heterostructures more quickly
and less expensively while at the same time maintaining their crystal
purity and improved sensing performance. Here, we report a sensor
based on NiO–WO3 nanorod heterostructures synthesized
through the facile-solution-based mixing method followed by gentle
heat treatment. This process maintains high-quality crystallinity
in constituent oxides without the formation of any secondary phase
in the composite form. With the use of this heterojunction nanorod
composite, enhanced H2S gas-sensing properties have been
realized compared with pure nanorods. The typical sensitivity was
230% toward 10 ppm H2S, and the lower detection limit could
reach the ppb level. This type of gas sensor showed better sensing
performance (room-temperature sensitivity, selectivity, and limit
of detection (LOD)) when compared with most of the literature reports.

The detailed conduction mechanisms of pure and heterostructure
oxides have been investigated through in operando impedance spectroscopy
analysis and equivalent circuit modeling. In addition to the adsorption–desorption
mechanism, a unique surface sulfurization process during H2S gas exposure is responsible for destroying the p–n junction
effect by creating various quasi-metallic byproducts (NiS, WS2–x). This leads to a larger decrease
in resistance from initial high base resistance, signifying the formation
of the p–n heterojunction of certain composites. The sulfurization
phenomena are only unique toward H2S, thereby improving
the selectivity against other reducing or oxidizing gases. The crystal
phase formation of these quasi-metallic species at the surface has
been further confirmed by in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis.
Impedance analysis revealed that the contributing resistive components
inside the heterostructures from grain, grain boundary, p–n
junction, and metallic species could be either cooperating or compensating,
depending on the specific molar ratio of individual oxides and the
overall conduction nature (p–n-type) of the oxides. It is argued
that by selecting a specific optimized molar ratio between constituent
WO3 and NiO nanorods, it is possible to minimize the compensating
conduction components (decreasing response) and maximize the cooperating
conduction (enhancing response) to develop a room-temperature, high-performance,
alarm-based H2S gas detector.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Morphology and Crystal
Structure
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the
WO3, W3N1, W1N1, W1N3, and NiO are shown in Figure 1a(i)–(v), respectively.
It can be observed that the diameters of the pure WO3 and
NiO are around 300 and 60 nm, respectively. The length of the WO3 is around 1–3 μm. Figure 1a(i) shows an SEM image of a typical WO3 nanowire bridging a pair of Au electrode fingers in a sensor
device. From Figure 1a(i)–(v), the ratio of WO3 and NiO in the images
matches the molar ratio calculated before, suggesting the formation
of uniform dispersion. The XRD patterns for WO3, NiO, and
NiO–WO3 nanoheterostructures are shown in Figure 1b. The peaks from
pure NiO are weak and broad, suggesting that the crystallinity of
the NiO nanowires is not very good. The XRD patterns of pure WO3 can be indexed to cubic phase (JCPDS card 75-2187). There
are no obvious peak shifts or any trace of other phases, besides pure
NiO and WO3, from other nanostructures. Therefore, the
crystal structure of the three nanoheterostructures is considered
to have originated primarily from the mixture of cubic NiO and WO3 with separate phases. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) spectra of different samples were studied to further investigate
valence chemistry and binding energy of constituent elements of the
as-prepared metal-oxide heterostructure samples. The carbon peak is
reset as 285.0 eV. The O 1s XPS spectra of various samples are enlarged
in Figure 1c. The XPS
spectra of O 1s core-level electrons measured from pure NiO and WO3 both display three peaks. The binding energies of 529.1 eV
in NiO and 530.6 eV in WO3 correspond with the lattice
oxygen in crystalline NiO and WO3.19 Here, O 1s signals present shoulders located at the high binding
energy (532.0–534.7 eV) side of each main peak for every sample,
which can be attributed to the OH species on the surface. The O 1s
peaks at 530.9 eV in NiO and 531.9 eV in WO3 belong to
the deficient or chemisorbed oxygen.20 Note
that because of the different chemical environments of O in heterostructure
oxides, each characteristic peak has some shifts in the three mixed
heterostructure samples. Table 1 lists the corresponding binding energies and atomic ratios
for different characteristic peaks of O 1s in these five oxide samples.
The ratio of lattice oxygen increases gradually with the increase
of WO3 content in three heterostructure samples, suggesting
that more surface oxygen vacancies had formed.

Figure 1d shows the Ni 2p electron core-level XPS spectra of hierarchical
W3N1, W1N1, W1N3, and pure NiO samples. For the pure NiO, the Ni 2p
signal could be dissolved into four peaks. The peaks at 855.4 eV and
861.3 eV are attributed to Ni 2p3/2, and the peaks at 873.1
and 879.1 eV are attributed to Ni 2p1/2. The Ni 2p peaks
of samples W1N3, W1N1, and W3N1 can also be separated into four peaks.
Compared with pure NiO, the spectrum of sample W3N1 exhibits an overall
shift to higher binding energy. The shift of Ni 2p peaks to higher
binding energy is about 1.5 eV. This phenomenon can be explained by
the strong interaction between WO3 and NiO nanowires in
sample W3N1, which implies the formation of p–n junctions and
leads to the increased surface activity of WO3 nanorods.

2.2 Gas-Sensing Performance
Hydrogen sulfide
is a colorless, toxic, and flammable reducing gas. Figure 2a shows the dynamic responses
of pure WO3, pure NiO, and NiO–WO3 nanoheterostructures
toward 10 ppm H2S measured at room temperature. The bare
NiO nanowires do not indicate any response against 10 ppm H2S, just as reported in our previous study.21 The sensitivity was enhanced significantly for W3N1, as discussed
later in greater detail.

to 0.2, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 ppm H2S gas at room temperature.
(c) Sensitivity variation of the W3N1 sensor as a function of H2S concentration. (d) Dynamic response of W3N1 against 10 ppm
H2S, CO, NH3, and C6H6. (e) Comparative performance for W3N1 toward 10 ppm H2S, CO, C6H6, and NH3.

The NiO–WO3 nanoheterostructures
show n-type gas-sensing behavior toward reducing H2S gas
due to the conductance difference in WO3 and NiO. The band
gap of WO3 (2.8 eV) is smaller than that of NiO (3.8 eV),
which means that the conductance of WO3 is better; this
made the WO3 more dominant in sensing signal variation.
The sensitivity decreases as the molar ratio of NiO increases further.
This can be explained as the spillover effect caused by the nonresponsive
insulating layer of NiO on the surface of WO3. Figure 2b indicates the dynamic
response of the W3N1 gas sensor exposed to different concentrations
of H2S at room temperature. The selectivity and sensitivity
toward hydrogen sulfide were significantly higher than toward other
gases, as shown in Figure 2d,e, possibly due to the lower dissociation energy of H2S. The dissociation energy of the hydrogen sulfide (91.2 kcal/mol)
is less than those of carbon monoxide (256.3 kcal/mol), benzene (112
kcal/mol), and ammonia (107.6 kcal/mol); as a result, the sensing
response perfectly matches the dissociation energy ranking of these
four gases.

Table 2 briefly summarizes the gas-sensing performance of various metal-oxide-based
sensors toward H2S at room temperature. The sensitivity
of our NiO–WO3 nanoheterostructures is comparable
with that reported in the literature. It is worth noting that the
synthesis method of our work is less expensive compared with others
reported in the literature (listed in Table 2).

2.3 Sensing Mechanism
When the Fermi level (EF) of one semiconductor material is different from that
of another (i.e., due to the work function difference), the electrons
flow across the grain boundary after the contact between these two
semiconductors until the Fermi energies have equilibrated at the interface.
For the contact between p- and n-type semiconductors, as illustrated
in Figure 3, the major
carrier (holes and electrons for p- and n-type semiconductors, respectively)
diffuses across the interface, leading to its depletion and the band
bending across the interface. For the metal-oxide-based field-effect
transistor sensors, O2 molecules can adsorb on their surface
upon exposure to air and thus extract electrons from the conduction
band (ECB) in the metal oxides, turning
into oxygen ions residing on the surface.

Figure 3 Schematic illustration
of the formation of p–n junction between n-type WO3 and p-type NiO.

Physically, both the
molecular (O2–) and atomic (O–, O2–) oxygen ions can be formed, whereas the coverage
of the latter will increase at elevated temperatures.31 The p–n junction formation on the nanoheterostructure
surface will decrease the barrier for electrons transfer from metal
oxide to the adsorbed O2, which will lead to the formation
of molecular oxygen ions (O2–) at room
temperature. For the nanowire materials, this p–n junction
formation will make the major carrier transfer channel narrower.

From the gas-sensing performance, it was found that the W and W3N1
samples show n-type behavior, whereas W1N1, W1N3, and NiO samples
indicate p-type behavior. This suggests that the gas-sensing performances
for these two types are predominantly controlled by the relative amounts
of the W and N sites. It is also evident from the microstructure that
the NiO nanowires are sequentially percolating the WO3 nanorods
with the increased NiO content; a generalized grain distribution model
of these two typical heterostructures (W3N1 and W1N3) is shown in Figure 4a,b, respectively.
For the W3N1 samples (Figure 4a), the current is predominantly controlled by the W sites,
whereas the N sites control the rest of the heterostructure sensors
(W1N1 and W1N3). For all of the sensing materials, W3N1 exhibits maximum
sensing performance.

Figure 4 Schematic conduction pathway model during H2S gas exposure for (a) W3N1 and (b) W1N3.

In general, three major factors play a role in enhancing
sensing performance. The H2S sensing mechanism for metal-oxide
sensors can be ascribed by two different mechanisms, adsorption–desorption
and sulfurization–desulfurization. Due to the room-temperature
operation, the adsorbed oxygen gas species on the oxide surface is
molecular oxygen ions (O2–). Thus, the
adsorption–desorption mechanism becomes 1  whereas for the sulfurization mechanism, the
NiO and WO3 grain surfaces can show the following set of
reactions 2   3  where x stands for the stoichiometric
ratio.

Due to first the reaction by reaction 1 (adsorption), the resistance of the pure
WO3 decreases as the number of majority carriers (electrons)
increases, whereas for p-type NiO, the resistance increases due to
the electron–hole recombination-induced reduction of the majority
carrier (hole). For sulfurization reactions (reactions 2 and 3), due to the
formation of semimetallic (narrower band gap materials) NiS(1–x) and WS(2–x),19 a much more conducting path can be created on
the surface of the sensors upon H2S gas exposure. Physically,
both mechanisms can simultaneously occur in pure metal-oxide samples.

However, the formation of the heterojunction between the NiO and
WO3, induced by the electrons from the WO3 side
diffusing to the NiO side and the holes from the NiO side toward the
WO3 site, leads to a large potential barrier and especially
a very high initial resistance of W3N1 samples in the air compared
with other samples. This is consistent with similar work reported
in the literature about the formation of p–n junctions.32,33 In the presence of H2S gas, this large potential barrier
decreases due to the adsorption–desorption mechanism but drastically
collapses due to the surface sulfurization (formation of WS(2–x)) process; both effects, in turn, cause a large
decrease in resistance. Therefore, for the W3N1 samples, the sensing
mechanism is enhanced by the collapse of heterojunction, which decreases
the resistance considerably.

For the p-type W1N1 and W1N3 heterostructures
(Figure 4b), the sensing
performance is dominantly controlled by the smaller NiO grains, since
the WO3 grains are segregated from the electrode. Similarly,
due to the adsorption–desorption mechanism, the resistance
of the NiO grain–grain boundary should be increased, whereas
the resistance decrease in the grain surface is also possible from
the sulfurization process. As a result, the total change in resistance
in H2S gas exposure depends on which of these two competing
processes (opposite change in resistance) is dominant. For the W3N1
heterostructure, the NiO-coated WO3 nanorods can easily
interconnect with finger electrodes and thus enhance the sensitivity
by the same direction change in resistance from the adsorption–desorption
mechanism, heterojunction effect, and sulfurization process, whereas
the sensitivity decreases for W1N1, W1N3, and NiO samples due to the
opposite compensation effect.

To further confirm the sulfurization
process, in situ XRD analyses were performed with the samples after
exposure to H2S. Figure 5a–c shows the XRD plot of all of the tested
sensors before and after injection of the H2S gas. Significantly,
the new intense peaks for WS(2–x) were confirmed for the W and W3N1 samples, but the NiS peaks were
weaker for rest of the samples. From the literature, Gibbs free energies
of NiS and WS2 formation are found as −61.6 and
−232.1 kJ/mol, respectively.19,34 Therefore,
the propensity of the sulfurization reaction of NiO is weaker than
WO3. Thus, a good combination and the same directional
changes due to the adsorption–desorption mechanism, heterojunction
effect, and sulfurization process enabled the W3N1 sample to achieve
higher sensitivity than any other samples.

for samples before and after H2S exposure (a) WO3, (b) W3N1, (c) NiO.

2.4 Impedance Spectroscopy Analysis
To
further confirm these cooperating and competing effects and to visualize
the individual effects, in situ alternating current impedance analysis
(amplitude 10 mV) was performed before and after gas exposure for
all pure and heterostructure sensors.

Figure 6a–e shows the measured the Nyquist
plot for the sensor in air and in 10 ppm H2S gas. The electrical
equivalent circuit model is adopted from the contribution of nanorod
grain, interboundary, or junction among nanorods. These can be expressed
as a set of resistor–capacitor (RC) parallel circuit components.
For n-type materials, major contributions for sensing come from nanorod
grain and grain boundary, and they can be expressed as a set of RC
(RCgrain and RCgrain boundary) circuits
(shown in Figure 7a).
For p-type material, the situation is different: when the electrons
are adhered by adsorbed molecular oxygen (O2–) from a p-type oxide surface, a vast amount of hole is accumulated
on the surface which leads to a thin conducting “shell”-like
accumulation layer and creates a lower conducting “core”
inside the oxide. This core–shell parallel electrical circuit
can be represented by two RC parallel circuits connecting in parallel
(Figure 7b).

Figure 6 Impedance spectroscopy
sensing plots of all samples against H2S (a) WO3, (b) W3N1, (c) W1N1, (d) W1N3, (e) NiO.

Figure 7 Schematic illustration of the overall equivalent circuit (a) n-type,
(b) p-type.

In addition to these
contributions, the “neck” contributions among nanorods
need to be considered. As our nanorods are loosely sintered at low
temperature (∼200 °C), the neck regions are widely opened
and thus should have another contribution (represented by an additional
RC circuit (RCneck)). The equivalent circuit can then be
simplified from equivalent contributions from the “core–shell”
(RCcore–shell) and RCneck (Figure 7b) connected in series. For
the mixed p–n heterostructure of NiO–WO3,
the actual model will be a superposition of all these components and
p–n nanojunctions across nanorods, which are responsible for
major resistive components on the sensor surface (represented by RCjunction). For simplicity, we followed the circuits for mixed
heterostructures per their gas-sensing performance (n- or p-type).
Thus, Figure 7a,b represents
the circuit schematic of heterostructure oxides that show n- and p-type
sensing behaviors, respectively.

Using the equivalent circuit
model, as previously discussed, the impedance data are fitted to extract
these parameters in the air and upon H2S gas exposure. Table 3 shows the calculated
resistances from each component for pure and heterostructure sensors
and the calculated sensitivities from individual resistance components
and total resistance change. Here, the negative and positive signs
signify the resistance decreases and increases in the presence of
gas exposure. As found from the analysis, both grain and grain boundary/junction
resistance decreased for W and W3N1, whereas other heterostructures
(W1N1 and W1N3) and N sample showed a competing behavior of corresponding
resistive components, leading to lower sensitivity.

3 Conclusions
An NiO–WO3 nanorod p–n heterojunction
random network structure was fabricated using the facile, sonication-based
solution mixing method for different volume ratios, followed by a
gentle low-temperature annealing (200 °C). The XRD data shows
the phase purity of constituent oxides in discreet and composite form
is maintained well. SEM images showed that shorter NiO nanorod distributed
around relatively longer WO3 nanorod (1D–1D structure)
and formed nanojunction coating. The exhibited heterojunction effect
is maximally observed for W3N1 (75 mol % WO3–25
mol % NiO) and confirmed by observation of the increase in resistance
due to the formation of diode-like p–n nanojunction at the
WO3–NiO interface.

The optimal room-temperature
H2S gas sensing with excellent selectivity was observed
for the W3N1 sensor, which exhibited a sensitivity of ∼230%
for 10 ppm H2S, this is 1–2 orders of magnitude
higher than individual oxides and other composite samples. The excellent
sensing performance for W3N1 is attributed to the p–n junction
effect, sulfurization by H2S (formation of WS2–x and NiS1–x),
and the ideal ratio of the NiO component in the composite. The formation
of reactive semimetallic products due to sulfurization was confirmed
by XRD analyses for H2S exhibited on the sensor’s
surface.

Further investigations from in situ impedance measurement
and RC equivalent circuit analyses during gas sensing were performed
to evaluate the grain–grain boundary or the contributing effect
of the p–n junction in sensing performance. It was found that
for the pure WO3 and W3N1 samples, these contributing effects
are in the same direction, resulting in a cooperating and highly sensitive
performance, whereas for other samples (W1N1, W1N3, and N), the samples
exhibited competitive influences, resulting in low sensitivity. The
W3N1 sensor also exhibited good selectivity to H2S compared
with other interfering gases, such as CO, C6H6, and NH3. This could be explained by additional semimetallic
conducting effects from H2S-mediated sulfurization and
lower dissociation energy of H2S.

This simple, economic,
and energy-saving method could be potentially attractive for the development
of various 1D–1D p–n junction composite sensors for
room-temperature, low-cost, alarm-based gas sensors to detect various
toxic gases, inflammable compounds, and explosives.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials Synthesis and
Sensor Fabrication
The WO3 and NiO nanowires (denoted
as W and N, respectively) were provided by Sigma Aldrich (product
number 774545, 774537). To prepare the xWO3–(1 – x)NiO (where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1) heterojunction, the individual nanowire samples
were prepared at the same concentration (0.01 M), with deionized water
as the solvent. Then, the samples were mixed separately in three different
volume ratios, such as 3:1 (WO3/NiO), 1:1, and 1:3, denoted
as W3N1, W1N1, and W1N3, respectively. Finally, the nanoheterostructure
dispersions were obtained after 30 min ultrasonication. Interdigitated
Au electrodes were fabricated using e-beam lithography on a silicon
substrate with an SiO2 thin top layer. A tiny drop of the
nanowire heterostructure dispersion was drop-casted on the Au electrode,
and the metal-oxide nanowires bridged the Au fingers after solvent
evaporation. After deposition, the pure metal-oxide nanowire sensors
were annealed at 200 °C for 1 h in Ar flow (1 lpm) to improve
the contacts among the sensing materials and between the sensing materials
and the Au electrodes.

4.2 Characterization and Gas-Sensing
Measurement
The morphologies and crystal structures of the
WO3 and NiO and all of the nanoheterostructures were studied
using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi S4800) and X-ray
diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy. The surface chemical composition was
characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (HP 5950A).

For in situ XRD detection, those five powder samples were deposited
onto the sample holder for X-ray scanning. For confirmation of sulfurization,
the sensor chips containing sensing materials were directly placed
on the sample holder for XRD analysis immediately after exposure to
H2S. The background signals of gold electrodes and silicon
substrate of sensor chips have been removed during the data analysis.

The sensing test was performed in an air-tight chamber. A constant
dc voltage was applied to the electrode gap bridged by nanowires or
nanowire heterostructures. The electrical resistance was measured
by a Keithley 2602 source meter. A typical gas-sensing test cycle
consisted of three continuous steps: (1) compressed dry air flow was
introduced into the sensing chamber as the baseline. (2) A target
gas diluted in the air was injected to generate the sensing signal;
the exposure time for the target gas was 5 min. (3) Clean air was
introduced again for sensor recovery. The sensor sensitivity (S) was defined as 4  where Ig and Ia are the currents measured in specific gas and in the
air, respectively.
