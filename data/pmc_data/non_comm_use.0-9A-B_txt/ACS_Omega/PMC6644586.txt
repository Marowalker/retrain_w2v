Oxygen atom transfer
reactions are receiving increasing attention
because they bring about paramount transformations in the current
biomass processing industry. Significant efforts have therefore been
made lately in the development of efficient and scalable methods to
deoxygenate organic compounds. One recent alternative involves the
modification of the Cadogan reaction in which a Mo(VI) core catalyzes
the reduction of o-nitrostyrene derivatives to indoles
in the presence of PPh3. We have used density functional
theory calculations to perform a comprehensive mechanistic study on
this transformation, in which we find two clearly defined stages:
an associative path from the nitro to the nitroso compound, characterized
by the reduction of the catalyst in the first step, and a peculiar
mechanism involving oxazaphosphiridine and nitrene intermediates leading
to an indole product, where the metal catalyst does not participate.

Introduction
Heteroatom transfer
reactions (particularly those involving oxygen)
have captivated the scientific community for a long time.1−5 Traditionally, most of the interest surrounding this kind of oxygen
transfer has pivoted around the development of reactions oxygenating
hydrocarbons (epoxydations, dihydroxylations, etc.), with the main
goal of increasing the functionalization of simple petrol-derived
building blocks.6−10 The interest in the generation of renewable feedstocks for the chemical
industry has prompted attention to the reverse procedure, deoxygenation
of oxygen-rich biomass sub(products), to produce highly reduced building
blocks, analogous to those obtained from petrol sources.11−17

In the development of oxygen transfer reactions, nature has
provided
us with a model: metalloenzymes.18−26 Notable key examples of these enzymes are the high-valent manganese
species implicated in the photosynthetic water splitting,27,28 or cytochrome P-450 as the responsible agent for the metabolism
of steroids.29 Among these metalloenzymes,
molybdenum is found in different types of oxotransferases sharing
a common active center that consists of one Mo(VI) atom with at least
one oxo ligand.30,31 Synthetic molybdenum systems
mimicking the chemical behavior of these oxotransferases have been
reported, the vast majority involving penta- and hexa-coordinated
molybdenum complexes featuring sulphurated bidentate ligands.25,32,33 There is limited information
on systems in which the coordination sphere is reduced to four ligands.
In all these systems, the [MoO2]2+ active core
has been only taken into account considering its oxidizing power and
more scarcely as a Lewis acid.34,35 On the basis of this,
we have recently published a theoretical study on the deoxygenation
of dimethylsulfoxide catalyzed by MoO2Cl2 that
showcases the unusual behavior of the molybdenum core as a Lewis acid
in the initial step of the mechanism36 diverging
from previous studies on similar reactions.14,23

In 2007, Sanz et. al. reported a promising new synthetic method
for the preparation of complex organic molecules bearing an indole,37 a scaffold with a strong relevance to medicinal
and pharmaceutical chemistry.38−40 This procedure is becoming very
popular to prepare indole derivatives41−43 and it involves the
modification of the classical Cadogan reaction in which a MoO2Cl2(dmf)2 complex catalyzes the reduction
of o-nitrostyrene derivatives in the presence of
PPh3 under thermal conditions (see Figure 1).44,45 Sanz et. al. proposed
that molybdenum only partially catalyzes the overall process exerting
its catalytic activity during the reduction of the nitro to nitroso
group. The subsequent reductive cyclization process furnishing the
indole is considered to evolve without the participation of the catalyst.

into its indole derivative via a molybdenum-catalyzed reduction.

In light of the potential of this
reaction in the synthesis of
bio-active compounds41,43 and its mechanistic uncertainties,46−50 we decided to study the mechanism of the Mo-mediated deoxygenation
of ortho-nitrostyrene in the presence of a phosphine
as a reducing agent.37,51 The possible initial roles of
[MoO2]2+ as a Lewis acid and as an oxidizing
agent have been explored, resulting in five alternative reaction paths.
The subsequent transformation of the transient nitroso derivative
into the final indole has also been analyzed and several mechanistic
questions on this second part of the mechanism have been addressed.
In our recent work, we have found that similar chemistry operates
through multisurface pathways, involving spin-crossing events along
the reaction mechanisms.14,36 We have, therefore,
taken particular account of the spin multiplicity of the stationary
points along the studied reaction mechanisms and when changes in spin
were present, the minimum energy crossing points (MECP) on the seam
formed between the crossing potential energy surfaces were computed
to obtain a qualitative picture of the probability of such forbidden
process to take place (for a quantitative picture spin–orbit
coupled density functional theory should be considered).52

Results and Discussion
Different
mechanisms can be envisaged for the molybdenum-catalyzed
monodeoxygenation of the nitro group in the presence of PMe3. We first followed the classical approach for the oxygen atom transfer
(OAT) reaction followed in nature,23,53 that is: the
reduction of the catalyst as the first step, followed by the generation
of a coordination vacancy on the metal center and a subsequent coordination
of the substrate.

The reduction of the molybdenum catalyst is
usually proposed to
take place through the nucleophilic attack of PMe3 on the
πMo–O* orbital in the Mo(VI) catalyst 1, leading to
the formation of Mo(IV) complex 2 (see Figure 2).36,54−57 The P–O distance found in 2 (dP–O = 1.56 Å) is very similar to that found
in isolated phosphine oxide compounds (dP–O = 1.52 Å),58−60 indicating a weak interaction between the metal and
OPMe3. Our calculations show that the triplet state in
this complex (2) is 7.3 kcal/mol more stable than the
singlet, suggesting that a switch between the singlet and triplet
potential energy surfaces may occur along the reaction path during
the evolution from 1 to 2. In this sense,
we have located a MECP near 2 (see Figure 2) analogous to that described for the Mo(VI)-mediated
reduction of sulfoxides with phosphine.36

Figure 2 Enzymatic-type
path: proposed mechanism for the molybdenum-catalyzed
OAT reaction between Ar-NO2 and PMe3, considering
the reduction of the catalyst as the first step. Red color indicates
structures with triplet ground states, whereas black color is used
for structures in the singlet state. Computations were performed at
the UB3PW91/Def2-SVPD (polarizable continuum model (PCM), toluene)
theoretical level. Gibbs free energies are reported in kcal/mol (1
atm and 298 K), relative to 1 + PMe3 + Ar-NO2.

The initial reduction of the catalyst
therefore involves a barrier
of 23.6 kcal/mol and a late post-transitional spin flip process. The
ulterior release of the OPMe3 ligand trough TS2–3 (ΔG‡ = 7.7 kcal/mol) results
in the formation of a trigonal complex, 3 (5.7 kcal/mol),
which features an extra coordination vacancy prompted to be filled
by nitrostyrene with the formation of complex 4 (through
a barrier of 10.8 kcal/mol). This energetically uphill path leading
to 4, further evolves toward the more stable chelate 5 via a facile coordination of the dangling oxygen atom of
the nitro group to the metal center (see Figure 2). The difference in energy between the triplet
and singlet in 5 is here reduced to just 0.13 kcal/mol
from 2.27 in 4, indicating that a crossing between the
singlet and triplet surfaces may lie nearby. Then, an oxygen atom
transfer reaction from the nitro group to the molybdenum center takes
place through an N–O bond cleavage (TS5–6) involving an activation barrier of 19.3 kcal/mol. The ground state
of this transition state is singlet, confirming that the spin switch
has occurred before the transition state. A low-energy crossing point
could actually be located between 5 and TS5–6 (see Figure 2). In
the last step of this catalytic cycle, the departure of the reduced
nitroso ligand allows the recovery of the catalyst through TS6–1 in an exergonic process (−24.7 kcal/mol).

Using the energetic span model,61 we
found that the rate determining stationary points of this catalytic
cycle are 2 (as the turnover determining intermediate)
and TS3–4 (as the turnover determining transition
state) with an energy span of 28.0 kcal/mol. This value is in fair
agreement with the thermal conditions required in this reaction (see Figure 1).

The uphill
energy values found for the tricoordinated Mo(IV) species 3 and the region around it, led us to reconsider the reactivity
of complex 2. This complex, which still displays a coordination
vacancy, could behave as a Lewis acid, thus, opening the door to alternative
mechanisms, as depicted in Figure 3. The Lewis acid reactivity of polyoxomolybdenum(VI)
compounds in redox processes is not usually taken into account, although
there is some literature on this topic.34−36,62,63 In this context, we found it
relevant to also explore the possibility of the catalyst behaving
as a Lewis acid before (complex 1 in Figure 2) and after its reduction to
Mo(IV) has taken place (complex 2 in Figure 2). Figure 3, therefore, contains the complex network
of reaction pathways available for both complexes when they react
as Lewis acids. The top section (blue) highlights the chemistry in
the Mo(VI) state, whereas the bottom section (yellow) contains the
chemistry in the Mo(IV) state. A manifold of steps connecting both
regions via PMe3 addition or OPMe3 release has
also been considered. The alternative pathways starting from Mo(VI)
complex 1 (see Figure 3, blue region) can be classified in terms of how late
the reduction of molybdenum occurs along the path. Hence, how late
they merge with the Mo(IV) path (yellow section in Figure 3).

Figure 3 Lewis acid-type path:
available reaction pathways for the molybdenum-catalyzed
OAT reaction between Ar-NO2 and PMe3 considering
the Lewis acid character of the catalyst. Mo(VI) pathways in blue
(top) and Mo(IV) paths in yellow (bottom) with the connecting manifold
between the two alternatives as vertical arrows on a blank background.
Entry/exit points to the traditional mechanism illustrated in Figure 2 and are indicated
as boldface structures (red color for triplets and black color for
singlets as in Figure 2). Computations were performed at the UB3PW91/Def2-SVPD (PCM, toluene)
theoretical level. Gibbs free energies in kcal/mol (1 atm and 298
K) relative to 1 + PMe3 + Ar-NO2 are shown.

The first step, common
to all these paths, involves the direct
coordination of nitrostyrene to the metal center, yielding 11 (11.0 kcal/mol). The long Mo–ONO bond distance, 2.54 Å,
and the invariance of the bond length between the oxygen and nitrogen
atoms dO–NO = 1.23 Å with respect to that of
the free nitro-system suggest a weak coordination between this ligand
and the [MoO2]2+ core. This may be the result
of the strong trans effect caused by the oxo ligand.64a Starting from intermediate 11, we found three different reduction paths:1. Path A: this path
avoids altogether
merging with the Mo(IV) mechanism. The reduction step occurs via a
direct attack of PMe3 on an oxygen of the nitro group (instead
of attacking an oxo ligand on the metal center), which leads to intermediate 13 (Figure 3). This intermediate can then evolve toward 6 through
the release of OPMe3 with an almost barrierless transition
state (0.6 kcal/mol). It could also be proposed that complex 13 releases the organic ligand, thus, connecting with the
energetically more demanding noncatalyzed process (see the Supporting
Information (SI) for more details). Once 6 has been formed, it evolves through a low-lying transition
state (ΔG‡ = 4.4 kcal/mol)
to the aryl nitroso compound recovering the active catalyst, 1.

2. Path B: the
nitro ligand chelates the
metal core through TS11–12 with a very low barrier
(0.6 kcal/mol) yielding 12. This complex is subsequently
reduced to 8 in the presence of PMe3, thus,
entering the Mo(IV) pathway. This reduction step is however energetically
very demanding (32.0 kcal/mol).

3. Path C: PMe3 attacks the
π* Mo=O bond trans to the nitro ligand in 11 through TS11–7 (ΔG‡ = 21.2 kcal/mol) and enters the Mo(IV) pathway (Figure 3, in yellow) with
the formation of complex 7. The significant decrease
of the Mo–ONO distance (from 2.54 Å in 11 to 2.00 Å in 7) and the increase of the O–NO
distance (1.27 Å) with respect to the free ligand are associated
with the impact of the softer trans effect created by the phosphine
oxide. The selectivity found in TS11–7 can be rationalized
on the grounds of the steric hindrance imparted by the nitro ligand
and the presumed lower apicophilicity of the oxo ligand.65,66 (See the SI for further discussion on
the stereoselectivity of the described processes.)



The energy spans in these three mechanisms are 32.2,
32.0, and
30.9 kcal/mol for paths A, B, and C, respectively. These values are
too high for these mechanisms to be competitive with the enzymatic-type
mechanism provided in Figure 2 (28.0 kcal/mol).

If we consider that the action of
molybdenum as a Lewis acid takes
place after reduction of complex 1 to 2,
the first step would be the complexation of a nitrostyrene molecule
to 2, leading to the formation of complex 7 (−8.1 kcal/mol, see Figure 3). The ground state for complex 2 is a
triplet, whereas 7 shows near degeneracy between the
singlet and triplet states (the latter lying only 0.6 kcal/mol above
the former). A spin flip area should therefore be located near 7. Indeed, a minimum energy crossing point between the two
surfaces, which qualitatively determines the activation barrier, can
be located so close to 7 that it is isoenergetic with
this minimum at the 0.1 kcal/mol precision level commonly employed
in density functional theory calculations (and also in most experimental
kinetic measurements). Once complex 7 is obtained, the
nitro ligand chelates easily, through a barrier of 3.5 kcal/mol, leading
to octahedral complex 8 (−15.4 kcal/mol). At this
point, intermediate 8 can release a molecule of OPMe3 to furnish complex 5 (thus, connecting this
path to that shown in Figure 2), but it can also suffer from (2 + 2) cycloreversion through
TS8–9 by which the initial nitro group loses an
oxygen atom (ΔG‡ = 23.8 kcal/mol)
leading to 9. This last alternative is not only kinetically
but also thermodynamically preferred, because 9 is a
rather stable intermediate compared with 5 (−27.8
vs −5.1 kcal/mol, for 9 and 5, respectively,
see Figure 3). Complex 9 can then evolve either through cleaving OPMe3, which yields 6 (−21.9 kcal/mol) or through
cleavage of the nitrosoaromatic ligand, yielding 10 (−31.3
kcal/mol), the latter being clearly favored. Finally, the departure
of the OPMe3 ligand in 10 through TS10–1 recovers the initial catalyst which can start a new cycle.

This last reaction pathway involving the initial reduction of the
complex and proceeding via 9 has an energy span of 23.8
kcal/mol, and hence, is more favorable than either of the alternatives
considered above, including the classical mechanism illustrated in Figure 2. These results
suggest that the classical pathway, involving a dissociative mechanism
and occurring via severely deficient species in terms of coordination
number, should be replaced by an associative mechanism, first
involving a reduction step and then the addition of nitrostyrene in
a Lewis acid/base step.

Once the deoxygenation of ortho-nitrostyrene is
completed, the reduction and concomitant cyclization of the nitrosostyrene
derivative to furnish the final indole is expected, nevertheless,
the mechanism is far from being well-known. For this second step,
we have discarded the participation of the metal as a catalyst taking
into account previous experimental results.67 Cadogan described how 2-nitrosobiphenyl and other derivatives can
be reduced to the corresponding carbazoles in the presence of phosphines
or phosphites very rapidly even under mild conditions (a few minutes
at 0–5 °C). This is indicative of low activation barriers
in the absence of the catalyst. Our own exploratory calculations agreed
with these results.b Some studies in the literature
suggest a tandem cyclization/reduction process in which the indole
is transformed first into an N-oxo-indole derivative
and ultimately into a hydroxyindole.41,68,69 However, the high reaction barriers computed for
the reduction of the former and the absence of a complete description
for the reduction of the latter led us to discard these alternatives
(see the SI for further discussion of these
pathways) and to consider the approach described for the Cadogan–Sundberg
reaction.70

In this approach the
proposed order of the steps is inverted with
respect to the tandem cyclization/reduction and a deoxygenation reaction
is followed by a cyclization step (Figure 4). We propose that the reducing agent, PMe3, initially attacks the nitrogen atom of 14,
through a barrier of just 13.1 kcal/mol, leading to 19, which can further evolve toward oxazaphosphiridine 20. The N–P bond in 20 is subsequently cleaved,
allowing the formation of a nitrene intermediate, 22,
via the loss of OPMe3.

Figure 4 Proposed mechanisms for the transformation
of nitroso compound 14 into indole 24. Computations
were performed
at the UB3PW91/Def2-SVPD theoretical level. Gibbs free energies in
kcal/mol (1 atm and 298 K) relative to 14 + PMe3 are shown.

All our efforts to locate
TS20–21 were unfruitful,
although the chemistry associated seems relatively simple (cleaving
a single N–P bond). To explore the potential energy surface
in greater detail in this region, we decided to apply the nudged elastic
band (NEB) method. This method provides the lowest energy pathway
connecting two minima and it thus offers an approximated value for
the activation energy associated with this bond cleavage.71 With this method (see the SI), we estimated the reaction barrier to be about 11 kcal/mol
and found why a transition state could not be located with standard
algorithms.c In this step the P–N bond
cleavage is strongly coupled with a twist of the aromatic ring, as
in an fouetté en tournant pirouette, whose ends rotated 180°
with respect to its initial position (Figure 5). Then 21 releases a molecule
of OPMe3 providing a nitrene intermediate which can undergo
cyclization. For the transformation of 14 into 22, we also explored the direct attack of the reducing agent
on the oxygen atom on the nitroso group but this resulted in a noncompetitive
path (see the SI, Figure S2).

Cadogan proposed that the cyclization step from nitrene 22 could occur on the most stable triplet surface.67,70,72,73 We confirmed
that the triplet state is indeed the ground state of the nitrene,
lying 9.3 kcal/mol lower than the singlet state, but found that the
barrier for cyclization in this spin state is incompatible with the
low thermal requirements of this reduction/cyclization tandem (0–5
°C).67 If, on the contrary, the reaction
is considered to proceed adiabatically, nitrene 22 would
evolve through cyclization via transition state TS22–23 in the singlet state, with an associated activation barrier of only
5.8 kcal/mol. This small activation energy is not only compatible
with the experimental conditions, but also with the nitrene being
such a fleeting intermediate so as to prevent it from relaxing electronically
to the triplet state due to the spin forbidden nature of this process.

Conclusions
In summary, we have disclosed here a detailed theoretical study
on the reductive cyclization of ortho-nitrostyrene
to furnish indole catalyzed by MoO2Cl2 and with
the participation of a trialkyl-phosphine molecule as a reductant.
Two series of mechanistic alternatives have been considered for the
monodeoxygenation of the nitro to nitroso group mainly diverging on
the role of the metal complex in the initial steps of the mechanism:
as a redox agent or as Lewis acid. Our computations predicted that
the most favorable mechanistic alternative is that in which the molybdenum(VI)
catalyst acts as a redox agent rather than a Lewis acid in the first
step and it immediately switches to a Lewis acid role for the second
step. The catalyst is thus acting in a manner similar to that proposed
for molybdoenzymes, but we have found that an associative mechanism
is more favorable than the commonly proposed dissociative path. The
subsequent conversion of the nitroso substrate to the final indole
system occurs preferentially following a reduction/cyclization tandem
process. In this second step the reductant is involved in a nucleophilic
attack on the N=O bond leading to an unusual oxazaphosphiridine
intermediate. These results, in agreement with the previous hypothesis
based on the experimental observations, reveal that the participation
of a PMe3 molecule is a requirement in both sections of
the mechanism (the nitro reduction and the reduction/cyclization tandem
process) but molybdenum seems to be only necessary for the reduction
of the initial nitro compound.

Computational Methods
Geometries
of all the stationary points were fully optimized by
using the UB3PW91 functional74,75 with the Def2-SVPD
basis set.76,77 The SDD(28, MWB) effective core
potential associated with this basis set was used to describe the
inner electrons of the Mo atom.78 The effect
of the solvent (toluene) was modeled using the polarizable continuum
model (PCM)79 with the default parameters
implemented in the Gaussian 09 package.80 The Orca program81 was used, at the same
computational level, to obtain the minimum energy crossing points
between triplet and singlet surfaces when a change in multiplicity
is needed along the reaction path. In these cases, the conductor-like
screening model82 was applied to take into
account the solvation effect. To check the accuracy of this approximation,
we optimized some of the minima and checked their relative energies
with both programs resulting in similar values, as expected. Harmonic
analysis was used to establish the nature of all optimized structures
as either minima or transition structures. For all stationary points,
the stability of the wave function was also confirmed.

To reduce
the computational cost associated with both the extra
electrons and a larger conformational space, we are using the smaller
trimethylphosphine as the reducing agent, instead of the actual triphenylphosphine
used in the experiments. We have checked that the reaction barrier
for the rate determining step is not severely affected by this simplification:
the reaction barrier obtained for TS1–2 with PPh3 is 34.11 kcal/mol and the reaction energy −7.83 kcal/mol
at the UB3PW91/Def2-SVPP level in toluene.

Although the catalyst
used in the experimental conditions is a
hexacoordinated species (MoO2Cl2(dmf)2, dmf = dimethylformamide), we have used the tetracoordinated MoO2Cl2 complex as the starting point of all our catalytic
cycles. In previous work, with similar Mo(VI)-catalyzed oxygen transfer
reactions, we analyzed the reactivity of MoO2Cl2(dmf)2, MoO2Cl2(dmf), and MoO2Cl2 and found that the latter is the most active
catalyst.36

To simplify the reaction
schemes, we have chosen a color code:
the structures and data colored in red are those for which the most
stable spin state is the triplet state and the data corresponds to
this same state. On the other hand, those structures and data colored
in black are those for which the singlet state is the most stable
state and the data corresponds to this same state.

a Despite being aware of the basic character
of PMe3, we have omitted the study of those paths in which
it is directly coordinated to the metal center due to the high barriers
reported elsewhere.36 As a consequence,
only those routes in which the nitro compound is in the inner coordination
sphere of the metal, in the first step, have been explored.

b We performed preliminary calculations
considering the metal-catalyzed reduction of nitrosostyrene to indole
and found that the catalyst had deleterious effects on the kinetics
of this process (produced higher activation barriers).
