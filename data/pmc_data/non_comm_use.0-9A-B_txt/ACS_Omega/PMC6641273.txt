Aqueous
suspensions of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), prepared
from natural cellulose by sulfuric acid hydrolysis, form stable chiral
nematic suspensions above a critical CNC concentration. The chiral
nematic organization may be preserved in films prepared from the suspensions
by evaporation. However, shrinkage, gelation, and shear during film
formation impair the optical properties of the dry film. In this article,
we report an unusual behavior for a sample in which gelation occurred
before the sample reached iridescent pitch values. In attempting to
decouple changes in texture due to evaporation from those due to shear
relaxation effects for this sample, we observed a transitory nematic-like
texture that was induced by shear during the preparation of the sample
for polarized light microscopy. We propose that the transition between
chiral nematic and nematic structures involves a twist–bend-like
intermediate and not an untwisting of the chiral nematic phase.

Introduction
Cellulose, the most
abundant organic material in the biosphere,
occurs in nature as long, thin microfibrils, which after suitable
mechanical and chemical processes form a family of nanocelluloses,
with widths of the order of a few nanometers and lengths ranging from
tens of nanometers to hundreds of micrometers. As the major biobased
sustainable nanomaterial, nanocellulose has attracted attention for
a number of applications.1−3

The relatively short cellulose
nanocrystals (CNCs), prepared by
sulfuric acid hydrolysis and stabilized by surface sulfate half-ester
groups, were found to have an unexpected property. Aqueous suspensions
of CNCs form a chiral nematic phase above a critical concentration.4 Evaporation of water gives a solid film of cellulose
that may preserve the chiral nematic structure.4,5 Addition
of small amounts of electrolyte to the suspension has been shown to
move the pitch of the chiral nematic into the range of visible light
wavelengths, resulting in iridescent films.6,7 Despite
the development of various methods to control the pitch and hence
the peak reflection wavelength of CNC8,9 and CNC-templated10 films, the reported optical properties are usually
poor, with broad reflection bands of intensities much lower than those
predicted for uniform chiral nematics with planar texture;11 thus, optimistic forecasts for optical applications
have as yet failed to materialize. This note is part of ongoing attempts
to understand the processes that influence the ordering of CNC suspensions
at high CNC concentrations.

The most intense and pure reflection
of circularly polarized light
from thin chiral nematic films is expected for planar textures, where
the chiral nematic axis is orthogonal to the surface of the film and
the CNCs are arranged in a helicoidal arrangement, with their long
axes parallel to the surface. Achieving a planar texture after the
evaporation of water from the chiral nematic suspension has been elusive.
A change in CNC concentration results in a change in pitch, and the
shrinkage also causes the texture to break up into smaller elements,
resulting in a grainy appearance. Under some circumstances, this texture
may anneal to give a regular parabolic focal conic texture,12 but the tendency of the suspensions to gel at
some CNC concentration often prevents further reorganization in the
liquid-crystalline state.13 This phenomenon
has been dubbed “kinetic arrest” by Honoratus-Rio et
al.14 Applying a radial shearing motion
to concentrated suspensions between glass surfaces has been suggested
to enhance optical properties,15 but no
reflection band wavelengths or intensities were measured. Controlling
the rate of evaporation has also been investigated.16,17

Changes in the ordered structure caused by an increase in
CNC concentration
during evaporation are reflected in the rheological properties of
the suspension. For example, Ureña-Benavides et al.18 followed the changes in the rheological behavior
of a cotton-based CNC sample from a dilute isotropic suspension through
a wide biphasic region to the chiral nematic phase and finally to
a gel phase. Conversely, the application of shear will generate deformation
of the ordered structures in the biphasic, chiral nematic, and gel
phases. The drying suspension is subject to shear, either intentionally
or otherwise. In this article, we attempt to decouple changes in the
texture of CNC aqueous suspension due to evaporation from those due
to relaxation effects. The changes in the optical texture of thin
layers of a concentrated chiral nematic CNC suspension are re-examined
as a function of time, leading to a novel proposal as to how the relaxation
of shear-deformed chiral nematic structures may occur.

Polarized
light microscopy is used to address the question of how
the texture of samples placed between a microscope slide and cover
glass changes with time when evaporation is inhibited. The usual progression
of chiral nematic textures in CNC suspensions is driven by increasing
CNC concentration, from isotropic suspension to biphasic fluids, in
which initial droplets of the chiral nematic suspension show fingerprint
layers characteristic of the chiral nematic phase. As the concentration
of CNCs increases, the droplets coalesce, resulting in typical planar
or focal conic textures, in which the fingerprint texture remains
visible for samples with pitch lengths of sufficient magnitude and
helical axes in the plane of the sample. Rather than starting from
dilute isotropic suspensions, preparation of samples for optical assessment
usually starts with concentrations in the biphasic or liquid-crystalline
regions. The shear applied during sample preparation generates a local
nematic (equivalent to an infinite pitch chiral nematic), which then
re-twists into a helicoidal structure, with pitch decreasing to its
equilibrium value. Decreasing pitch is observed during evaporation
of chiral nematic suspensions, but here we attempt to keep the CNC
concentration constant and observe the change in optical textures
with time.

The textures observed by polarized light microscopy
have long been
used to deduce the organization of liquid-crystalline phases.11 The technique can in principal be supplemented
by electron microscopy and a range of scattering techniques that give
structural information regarding the orientation and spacing of CNCs
in impressive detail,19 but the lack of
a uniform optical axis, the relatively rapid changes in texture with
time, and the need for freeze-fracturing and sectioning hinders its
application to our CNC suspensions.

Shear orientation and relaxation
of chiral nematic structures is
usually considered to involve an untwisting and a twisting process
around the helicoidal axis,15 but there
are constraints on a simple twisting process around the helicoidal
axis, as the nematic pseudolayers would have to twist relative to
each other, requiring macroscopic displacements and generating intermediate
pitch values. We suggest that there is an alternative mechanism for
shear relaxation of CNC suspensions, involving an intermediate stage
between nematic and chiral nematic ordered suspensions that is analogous
in some ways to the twist–bend phase, Ntb, observed
for molecular liquid-crystalline phases of bent molecular species.20

Twist–Bend Structure
For
a conical helicoidal structure with axis along the z direction of a right-handed Cartesian coordinate frame,
the director of a twist–bend structure, n̅, is defined by 1  where θ0 is the constant
oblique angle (the tilt angle) of the director with the helix axis, z, and φ is the azimuthal angle of the oblique helicoid.
φ = 2π(z/P) = tz, where t = 2π/P and P is
the pitch of the conical helicoids.20

Note that eq 1 also
describes the nematic phase, N, when θ0 = 0 and the
chiral nematic phase, N*, when θ0 = π/2.

In essence, the twist–bend structure resembles the chiral
nematic structure, except that the CNCs at a given position, z, along the helix axis take up a fixed tilt angle, θ0, relative to the helix axis, rather than being at 90°
to the helical axis, as is the case for a normal chiral nematic structure.
The twist–bend structure differs from that of a smectic C*
phase11 in that the director twist is continuous
and lacks the layered structure of smectic phases.

To examine
how this might affect the texture observed by polarized
light microscopy, eq 1 may be used to calculate the director orientation for some arbitrary
values of θ0, the tilt angle. [See Figure S1 in the Supporting Information.]

Experimental
Section
The CNC suspension was prepared as described previously21,22 from Whatman cotton powder by acid hydrolysis with 64 wt % sulfuric
acid at 45 °C for 45 min. After quenching, washing by repeated
centrifugation and re-dilution with water, and dialysis against deionized
water, the CNCs were dispersed by sonication. To ensure that the stabilizing
sulfate half-ester groups on the surface of the nanocrystals were
in the acid form, the suspension was stirred first over a mixed-bed
ion-exchange resin and then over a strong acid resin. (It thus corresponds
to the CNCs used to prepare suspensions SB-6 and SB-8 in ref (22).) The suspension was filtered
and concentrated to 9.6% by weight, as determined gravimetrically.
To measure the relative amounts of isotropic and anisotropic phases
as a function of CNC concentration, the samples in sealed glass rectangular
microslides were allowed to stand in a vertical position until no
further change in the phase boundary was detected (at least 48 h).
The results (Figure 1) indicated that a concentration of 9.6% should be essentially anisotropic.
The surface charge of this CNC was 150 mmol/kg, measured by conductometric
titration.

Figure 1 Phase composition as a function of concentration of CNCs in the
suspension.

For polarized light microscopy,
samples of the suspension were
placed on microscope slides to which spacers made from the plastic
adhesive rings used to reinforce sheets in stationery binders were
attached. Two of the rings provided suitable sample thicknesses. The
microscope slides and cover glasses were used as received. A 20 μL
sample of CNC suspension was pipetted into the center of the spacer
ring, and a cover glass was placed on top to minimize evaporation.
The sample thickness was 0.185 ± 0.005 mm, measured with a digital
micrometer. To try and enhance uniformity, a gentle shearing action
was applied to the samples by displacing the cover glass back and
forth a small distance.

Photographs of the CNC textures were
taken by a Nikon Eclipse LV100POL
optical microscope equipped with a camera and a 530 nm wave plate.
Unless otherwise indicated on the images, the samples were placed
on the microscope stage such that the initial shearing action was
in a horizontal direction on the image, the crossed polars were oriented
horizontally and vertically, and the 530 nm wave plate, if used, was
aligned in a direction from bottom right to top left on the images.

Results
For these observations, we started with a partially gelled suspension
at a sufficiently high CNC concentration (9.6 wt %) such that it is
in the chiral nematic phase (no isotropic phase) and with a pitch
large enough to be visible in the optical microscope. The CNC sample
used in this work differed from standard CNC samples in that gelation
occurred at a relatively low concentration, trapping the pitch at
sufficiently long values so that the final dry films showed no iridescence.13

The progression in textures of the same
area of a thin sample of
suspension is presented in Figures 2–5. The results are summarized
in Figure 2. Initially,
squeezing the suspension between the glass slide and cover plate produced
a complex pattern of birefringence when viewed between crossed polars.
The interference colors in the photomicrographs indicate local differences
in birefringence, whereas dark lines indicate (1) liquid-crystal disclinations,11 (2) regions where the CNCs are oriented parallel
to the directions of the polars, or (3) regions where the CNCs are
perpendicular to the plane of the sample. The initial pattern shows
some orientation along the long direction of the image, reflecting
a local shear orientation of the sample. After 30 min, the orientation
has decreased and more symmetrical patches of birefringence develop,
which, after a few hours, form the networklike pattern characteristic
of a long-pitch chiral nematic phase (Figure 2g).

Figure 2 Overview of texture change with time for 9.6
wt % CNC suspension
between a microscope slide and cover glass, viewed between crossed
polars: (a) 5 min, (b) 30 min, (c) 60 min, (d) 110 min, (e) 170 min,
(f) 330 min, and (g) 18 h. The spacer thickness is 185 μm. The
same area of the sample is shown in each segment.

Examining each stage in more detail, the initial relaxation
from
the shear applied when sandwiching the CNC suspension between a microscope
slide and cover glass is shown in Figure 3. The initial shear orientation (Figure 3a) becomes more uniform,
until after 25 min the texture in Figure 3c is observed.
This texture is characteristic of the marble texture commonly observed
for nematic liquid-crystalline materials, in which
areas of differing uniform director orientation occur.23 Whereas the untwisting of a chiral nematic under
applied shear or other fields gives a nematic-like orientation, normally
high shear forces are required for untwisting CNC suspensions,24 and the orientation of the director is uniform
along the direction of shear. Neither case applies to the sample shown
in Figure 3c.

Figure 3 Texture change
with time for 9.6 wt % CNC suspension between a
microscope slide and cover glass, viewed between crossed polars: (a)
immediately after preparation, (b) after 5 min, and (c) after 25 min.

After 45 min, the marble texture,
indicating a randomly oriented
nematic phase, starts to transform into the more ordered texture shown
in Figure 4a. The patches
of uniform birefringence are partially replaced by a threadlike texture,
typical of a nematic with predominant director orientation in the
plane of the sample. Evidence for a schlieren texture, characteristic
of a nematic with the director normal to the viewing direction, is
not readily evident, presumably because shear and surface orientation
favor an orientation parallel to the constraining surfaces.

Figure 4 Texture change
with time for 9.6 wt % CNC suspension between a
microscope slide and cover glass, viewed between crossed polars: (a)
after 45 min, (b) after 75 min, and (c) after 105 min.

With time, the threads become more distinct and
narrower (Figure 4b,c).
After several
hours, the pattern becomes typical of a long-pitch chiral nematic,
with areas of planar orientation (director normal to the plane of
the sample) separated by walls where the chiral nematic director is
in the plane of the sample (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Texture change with time
for 9.6 wt % CNC suspension between a
microscope slide and cover glass, viewed between crossed polars with
a 530 nm red plate after (a) 330 min and (b) 18 h.

In Figure 5, the
sample is viewed between crossed polars, and in this case, a 530 nm
red plate has been added to indicate the orientation of the birefringent
layers. The spacing of the fingerprint lines in the walls is relatively
uniform, giving a line spacing of around 35 μm, corresponding
to a chiral nematic pitch of ∼70 μm. The observations
on this texture progression for a thin layer of a relatively concentrated
viscous CNC sample show a clear progression from an initially nematic texture when freshly placed between a microscope
slide and cover glass to the expected chiral nematic texture after standing undisturbed for a few hours.

Discussion
The clear evidence for an initial nematic-like rather than chiral
nematic organization of the thin samples between glass surfaces was
unexpected in view of the very moderate and transient shear applied
during sample formation. Also unexpected was the observation that
the sample showed no signs of uniform orientation under the polarized
light microscope, despite the attempt to apply unidirectional shear
by displacing the cover glass in a given direction (along the long
direction of the microscope slide). Evidently, the radial spreading
as the cover glass was pressed down onto the droplet of suspension
on the microscope slide also generated shear, so no clear orientation
direction was observed. Evidence for the spontaneous nematic organization
of biphasic suspensions of CNCs derived from bacterial cellulose has
previously been presented by Araki and Kuga.25 On standing, a 1.58% suspension in water displayed a schlieren texture,
characteristic of the nematic phase. Their CNC sample had a higher
aspect ratio than those from cotton and wood, and their suspension
exhibited chiral nematic properties as the ionic strength of the suspension
was increased. A characteristic nematic wormlike texture has also
been reported for cationic CNC thixotropic gels,26 indicating that, in this case, the nematic director was
predominantly normal to the plane of the sample. Nematic-like order
in cellulose has also been observed under nonequilibrium conditions.
For example, Kondo and co-workers have introduced “nematic
ordered cellulose”, a noncrystalline form of cellulose prepared
by stretching molecularly dispersed cellulose gels.27 Rheological and rheo-optical measurements of CNC suspensions
often show evidence for a nematic-like ordering in the shear direction.18 Factors such as suspension pH may also alter
the orientational response to shear.28 The
best-controlled way to generate a nematic organization from a chiral
nematic CNC suspension exploits the negative diamagnetic susceptibility
of cellulose by applying a rotating magnetic field to the sample.29,30 It seems that a range of factors may generate a transitory nematic
organization, but the normal state for concentrated CNC suspensions
is chiral nematic.

Experimentally, the apparent nematic texture
is unstable. For the
relatively concentrated suspensions examined here, the relaxation
to a (presumably equilibrium) chiral nematic texture requires several
hours, passing through intermediate textures such as that shown in Figure 6. Similar textures
were observed for all samples after 1–3 h from sample preparation,
independent of the direction and duration of the initial applied shear.
In subsequent images (Figure 5), the colored lines became closer together and uniformly
spaced, as expected for chiral nematic samples with the helix director
in the plane of the sample. The rich variations in the width and color
of the multiple lines with their orientation relative to the crossed
polars (Figure 6) are
in line with the patterns predicted for twist–bend textures
illustrated in the Figure S3.

The response of anisotropic fluids to shear is complex and
challenging,
especially for polymeric and colloidal fluids, where viscoelastic
phenomena may be important.31 In practice,
the transition between nematic (shear-induced) and chiral nematic
states (and vice versa) is often viewed as a simple twisting or untwisting
around the chiral nematic axis. This is illustrated in Figure 7e, where a nematic arrangement
with the director along the x direction twists through
(d) to give a chiral nematic arrangement with the helicoidal axis
in the z direction. Conversely, application of shear
along the x direction causes the chiral nematic structure
(c) to unwind to give an intermediate structure (d) before aligning
with the shear direction. This process requires elastic distortion
over a length scale of the order of the pitch, and singularities arise
each half-pitch, where the orientation of the nanocrystals is orthogonal
to the x–z plane. We propose
an alternative route between nematic and chiral nematic that starts
with the nematic director along the z axis (Figure 7a). This corresponds
to a tilt angle θ0 = 0 relative to the helix axis
along the z direction (eq 1). Increasing the tilt angle gives a twist–bend
type of CNC orientation (Figure 7b), until, at tilt angle θ0 = 90°,
the equilibrium chiral nematic structure is restored. This process
involves an affine deformation, with a cooperative reorientation over
a length scale of the order of the CNC long dimension. Application
of shear to the chiral nematic would reverse the process via (b) to
(a). This mechanism might explain the relative ease with which small
amounts of shear appear to generate a transitory nematic organization.

Figure 7 Sketch
of possible relaxation routes from shear-induced nematic
(a) and (e) to chiral nematic (c) structures. On the right, the transformation
(e)–(d)–(c) occurs by twisting around the z axis. On the left, the transformation occurs via a twist–bend
structure (b).

A clear distinction must
be made between the twist–bend
structure resulting from a nonequilibrium shear relaxation process
envisaged here and the observation of equilibrium twist–bend
phases observed for small molecule bent achiral mesogens. In the small
molecule case, the mesogen is typically an achiral bent molecule,
roughly 0.3 nm by 3 nm, that forms both left- and right-handed twist–bend
nematic phases with pitch values less than 10 nm.20 This small pitch value is of the order of the thickness
of individual CNC rods and is 2 orders of magnitude smaller than typical
pitch values for the left-handed chiral nematic CNC suspensions at
the concentrations observed above. Perhaps, most importantly, the
twist–bend structure envisaged for CNC suspensions is a transient,
kinetically controlled state that occurs when a shear-induced nematic
organization relaxes to the equilibrium chiral nematic ordered state.
Evidence for a twist–bend
phase includes the observation of asymmetric or incomplete “Bouligand
arcs” in freeze-fracture transmission electron microscopy images
of dimeric cyanobiphenyl and fluorinated terphenyl liquid crystals.20 For the much longer pitch CNC suspensions, we
propose that the variable band structure observed by polarized light
microscopy during the transition from nematic to chiral nematic textures
provides some evidence for a similar twist–bend structure at
a larger length scale (see the Supporting Information).

Two further points on texture evolution may be noted. At
very short
times after relaxation of shear, viscoeleastic liquid-crystalline
polymers may form regions of alternating birefringence, often termed
“bands” if perpendicular to the initial shear direction
and “stripes” if parallel to the initial shear direction.31 Evidence for an initial band texture for the
9.6 wt % CNC suspension is shown in the Supporting Information. However, this phenomenon is short-lived for CNC
suspensions and has little effect on the subsequent texture evolution.
At the other end of the time scale, it takes hours for the reorientation
of chiral nematic directors, from an initially random orientation
with many disclinations to planar regions (director perpendicular
to microscope slide) separated by walls where the director is parallel
to the slide surface (Figure 5). Further reorganization to give a completely uniform planar
texture was not achieved for the samples examined here. The time required
for director reorientation is thus much longer than the time normally
taken to prepare films by evaporation. This may explain the complex
texture and relatively poor optical performance of most chiral nematic
CNC films.

Conclusions
1. Concentrated CNC suspensions close
to gelation display a novel series of changes in liquid-crystalline
texture when allowed to relax between microscope slide and cover glass.

2. The initial polarized light
microscopy
images, characteristic of shear-oriented samples, developed textures
characteristic of nematic order before relaxing into the characteristic
chiral nematic textures.

3. The relaxation from nematic to chiral
nematic order passed through novel textures, which we ascribe to an
organization analogous to a liquid-crystalline twist–bend structure.
