Size confinement for tailoring of
electronic structures can in
principle be explored for enhancement of photocatalytic properties.
In the present work, vanadium-doped bismuth oxide nanoparticles, with
an average particle size of 36 nm, are synthesized for the first time,
using the thermal plasma method, in large scale with high yield to
explore for photocatalytic applications. The electronic and crystallographic
structures of the sample are studied experimentally and theoretically.
Systematic investigations of the electronic structure of the fluorite
type cubic phase of Bi11VO19 nanoparticles are
reported for the first time. Enhancement is observed in the photocatalytic
activity as compared to other delta phases of bismuth vanadate. The
valence band is found to comprise mainly of O 2p states, whereas the
conduction band arises from V 3d states giving rise to a band gap
value of 2.26 eV. Absence of excess O in δ-Bi2O3 results in shrinking of the band gap because of O 2p, Bi
6s and 6p states from the surrounding atoms at doping sites. Bi11VO19 nanoparticles show an efficient visible light
absorption and exhibit excellent photodegradation properties of methylene
blue solution under visible light irradiation.

1 Introduction
Photocatalytic
splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen, and
the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants are promising
applications as far as energy and environmental issues are concerned.
After the report of Honda–Fujishima on photoelectrochemical
water splitting, considerable progress has been made on the research
front in the applications of photocatalysts both in energy and environmental
issues.1 Tremendous interest has been generated
for the discovery of new efficient photocatalysts and different approaches
to improve the performance of semiconductor-based artificial photocatalytic
processes. TiO2 is an extensively studied semiconductor
photocatalyst because of its nontoxic nature and chemical stability.
However, because of the wide band gap of TiO2, ultraviolet
(UV) light is essential for excitation which restricts its practical
applications. The main objective in photocatalytic water splitting
is to efficiently utilize visible light to conduct the photoelectrochemical
reaction. Among large number of catalysts used for H2 and
O2 evolution under visible light, semiconductors with appropriate
valence band (VB) edge have attracted more attention.2 In that direction, significant research efforts have been
devoted to metal oxide semiconductors, such as BiVO4, Bi2O3, Bi2WO6, WO3, and Fe2O3 because of their visible light
photocatalytic activities.3−8

Among the various narrow-band-gap (1.8–2.8 eV) semiconductors,
bismuth oxide is known to be a suitable candidate because of its unique
properties including adequately high oxidation power of valence hole
(∼+3.13 V vs NHE), nontoxic nature, and superior band edge
potential suitable for H2 and O2 evolution on
water splitting.9 Bismuth oxide occurs
in six crystal phases; α, β, γ, δ, ε,
and ω phases. Monoclinic α-Bi2O3 is the most stable phase at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.
A phase transition occurs from α-Bi2O3 to δ-Bi2O3 on heating above 1000 K,
which restricts its application at room temperature, and this phase
is stable up to the melting point.

The metastable β and
γ phases are observed during the
cooling of δ-Bi2O3. ε-Bi2O3 can be obtained by the hydrothermal route, whereas
the ω-Bi2O3 phase is reported to be formed
on the BeO substrate.10 The chemical instability
is known to be the main obstacle for the application of Bi2O3 as a photocatalyst. These barriers are reported to
be overcome by metal doping or by making composites. An enhancement
in the visible light sensitivity is achieved by engineering the narrow
band gap. δ-Bi2O3 is a technologically
important oxide ion conductor because of its high oxide ion conductivity
governed by the high concentration of oxygen vacancies and high anionic
mobility.11 In the defected fluorite structure,
the high polarizability of the Bi3+ cation with its lone
pair of electrons can act as an enhancing factor for observed ionic
conductivity along with the possible weak Bi–O bond, promoting
a greater mobility of the oxygen vacancies in the lattice.12

Bi2O3 is known to
be a superior candidate
for the degradation of organic pollutants.13 For efficient utilization of solar light, effective oxidation of
environmental organic pollutants and environmental friendly features,
development of bismuth oxide (Bi2O3)-based compounds
for an efficient visible light photocatalyst is needed. However, pure
Bi2O3 has been known not to be good as a photocatalyst
because of the inability of its conduction band (CB) electrons (∼+0.33
V vs NHE) to scavenge surface oxygen molecules (E°(O2/O2•–) =
−0.33 V vs NHE) resulting in fast recombination of the photoexcited
electrons and holes. Extensive work has been carried out, including
the microstructure control and the surface deposition of noble metal,
to tackle these problems.

In Scheelite BiVO4, 6s2 lone pair of Bi3+ induces repulsive force which
causes a heavy distortion.
This distortion induces charge separation resulting into internal
polarization. In the VB, O 2p states hybridize with Bi 6s states,
leading to effective lowering of the band gap. In the bismuth-based
oxide systems, the alternate (Bi2O2)2+ layers play a significant role for photocatalysis. Bi2O3 is an appropriate candidate as a photocatalyst because
of its nontoxic nature and suitable band gap. Also, the band gap can
be easily modified by introducing a small amount of other elements
because of easy incorporation of ions in this structure and its solid
solubility. The δ-Bi2O3 structure is obtained
using the solid solution method by adding adequate tetravalent or
higher valence cations.14

Recently,
bismuth vanadate nanoparticles,15 nanotubes,16 nanorods,17 nanowires,18 nanofibers,19 nanosheets,20 and
microflowers21 have been reported to show
efficient photocatalytic activity. These nanoparticles can be synthesized
by sol–gel,22 coprecipitation,23 or hydrothermal24 and solvothermal methods.25 There are
very few reports on synthesis of the δ-phase Bi11VO19. Lu et al. have synthesized Bi11VO19 using the Pechini method and have shown that its photocatalytic
activities could be attributed to its low band gaps and presence of
ion vacancies and polarizing fields.14

The thermal plasma method is of increasing interest because of
its ability to synthesize nanoparticles of variety of metals and metal
oxides in large scales. The thermal plasma process used here to synthesize
the nanoparticles is convenient and economical and provides high yield.
This process gives a clean reaction atmosphere, which is essential
for the synthesis of high purity compounds. It also provides high
enthalpy which increases the reaction kinetics by several orders of
magnitude and abrupt temperature gradient that make rapid quenching
and generation of fine nanoparticles easily possible.26 In the present study, we have adopted the approach of synthesizing
high-temperature δ phase of Bi11VO19 nanoparticles
using the thermal plasma method.

Photocatalytic activity depends
on the physical properties such
as crystal structure, surface area, particle size, and surface hydroxyls
of Bi11VO19. Along with the physical properties,
it also depends on the operating conditions (e.g., initial concentration
of chemicals and their pH values, amount of catalyst, and light intensity).
In the bismuth based oxides, slightly distorted crystal structures
can also enhance the lone pair impact of Bi 6s states. This provides
a handle to tune optical properties to achieve excellent photocatalytic
activity.

To the best of our knowledge, Bi11VO19 is
successfully synthesized for the first time using the thermal plasma
method and the present work reports a detailed study. The nanoparticles
in the size range of 30–35 nm are investigated for structural
studies, surface morphology, and optical properties by X-ray diffraction
(XRD), Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
and UV–vis absorption spectroscopy. The X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), VB spectroscopy (VBS), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy
(XAS) measurements are performed to study electronic properties such
as the chemical state, density of states, and lone pair-induced lattice
distortions. The methylene blue (MB) dye degradation experiment is
carried out under visible light irradiation to study the efficient
photocatalytic activity of Bi11VO19 nanoparticles.
Electronic structure calculations are performed, and theoretical results
are compared with experiments to shed light on crystallographic and
electronic structural information.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Theoretical Calculations
The δ-Bi2O3 is known to be stable above
1000 K adopting
the fluorite structure. Each unit cell of δ-Bi2O3 has two vacant oxygen sites which provide probable transport
sites for oxygen atoms causing its known high conductivity. There
has been huge debate over type and combination of O vacancies; however,
till date no clear theory is widely accepted. Three types of simple
vacancies are popularly proposed to be stable, namely two O vacancies
in ⟨100⟩, ⟨110⟩, and ⟨111⟩
directions.13,27−32 Other complex combinations of divacancy are also reported.27 However, all the simple vacancy structures are
known to be dynamically unstable, and the breaking of symmetry by
local distortion around Bi is reported to be essential for describing
the electronic and crystallographic structure of δ-Bi2O3.32

In the present
work, a configuration of O vacancies in the ⟨111⟩ direction
is adopted because it is reported to be isostructural with As2O3 and Sb2O3.42 The cohesive energy and structural parameters
of such δ-Bi4O6 and α-Bi8O12 are shown in Table 1, which are found to be in agreement with the previously
reported results.32 On account of higher
electronegativity of Bi than V, substitutional doping is expected
for V at Bi site. The vanadium doping at 8.3, 12.5, and 25% of Bi
is carried out by forming requisite supercells namely δ-Bi12O18, δ-Bi8O12, and
δ-Bi4O6 and replacing one Bi by V, respectively.
Respective local minimum energy state geometries can be found in Supporting Information (S2). It is to be noted
that on potential landscape these are expected to be the shallow local
minima states because of the large number of available O vacant sites
and known ionic mobility of O ions in pristine and transition metal-doped
δ-Bi2O3. Figure 1a shows the local minimum energy state geometry
of the δ-Bi11VO18 structure. In this unit
cell, the vanadium site is surrounded by four oxygen atoms which form
a VO4 tetrahedron and the bismuth sites are surrounded
by 3 and 4 oxygen atoms, forming BiO3/4 complexes per unit
cell. The respective cohesive energies and structural information
are incorporated in Table 1. The stability (compared by EC/atom and Esub) and the respective bond
lengths are found to decrease with increase in V concentration. This
is expected as bonding of V with O is stronger than bonding of Bi
with O, and it causes significant distortion at substitutionally doped
V site resulting in the decrease of the average bond length.

To the best of our knowledge, despite extensive work
carried out
for various phases of transition metal-doped bismuth oxide, only a
single report has suggested the existence of the δ-Bi11O19V phase.14 However, geometrical
and electronic structures and their effect on photocatalytic and optical
properties are not clear. Hence, in the present work, we exclusively
focus on the structural and electronic properties of δ-Bi11VO19 and their effect on photocatalytic and optical
properties of the material.

In the present experimental work,
excess O is found in V-doped
systems, hence knowing lower electronegativity of V than Bi, δ-Bi11VO19 is expected to form by the addition of one
O atom near the V site in the δ-Bi11VO18 system. The initial structure of the δ-Bi11VO19 unit cell has been chosen to be consisting of three Bi4O6 units along c-axis with single
Bi replaced by V. It has two oxygen vacancies along the ⟨111⟩
direction per Bi2O3 unit in the supercell (except
BiVO3 unit). Ab-initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
run is performed as described in Section 4.1, and several local lowest energy structures
are picked and ionically relaxed to obtain local minimum energy state
δ-Bi11VO19 geometry as shown in Figure 1b. The geometry of
the relaxed structure is found to be considerably distorted for O
sites. Five O atoms are found to have an average bond length of 1.81
Å with V, whereas one O atom has a bond length of 2.25 Å.
The skeleton of Bi atoms with respect to the initial structure (cubic)
is found to be slightly distorted after MD simulation, with distortion
in unit cell angles up to 0.02%, which however breaks the symmetry.
No negative vibrational frequencies (refer Supporting Information S3) are observed for the proposed δ-Bi11VO19 structure, suggesting that it is energetically
stable. EC/atom and Esub of the system are found to be larger than δ-Bi11VO18, suggesting its higher stability. Infact, Esub is found to be highest for δ-Bi11VO19 among all the structures studied in the present
work. This suggests higher affinity of the V-doped system for excess
O atoms at the V site. Inclusion of more than one O atom per unit
cell is structurally not feasible without distorting structure from
δ-phase bismuth oxide; hence, higher numbers of oxygen atoms
are not included. To understand the effect of V–V interaction
and its distance dependence, 2 × 2 supercells of δ-Bi11VO18 and δ-Bi11VO19 are formed by selecting appropriate V-doping sites having a distance
more than 7 Å as shown in Figure 1b for δ-Bi44V4O72 and 1d for δ-Bi44V4O76. As expected, the EC/atom
and Esub for such supercells are found
to be higher compared to respective unit cells. This can be understood
from the fact that V doping induces local structural deformation as
compared to the pristine system. However, the trend of higher band
gap than in the excess O system is found to remain intact with increase
in the nearest neighbor V–V distance. MD simulation on the
δ-Bi44V4O76 system is performed
and local ground state geometry is obtained by ionic relaxation. The
major structural change in the local optimized structure in comparison
to the initial structure is that the original structure has four tetrahedrally
bonded VO4 complexes, whereas the local ground state structure
has two VO4 complexes and two deformed trigonal bipyramid
VO5 complexes, with the resultant structure 3 eV lower
in energy. After the MD simulation, the average bond length of VO4 complex is 1.73 Å, whereas the average bond length increases
in the VO5 complex to 1.85 Å.

The effect on
the electronic structure after vanadium doping in
δ-Bi2O3 is studied to understand the mechanism
of the observed enhanced photocatalytic performance of Bi11VO19. The site-projected partial density of states (l-DOS)
[with the Fermi energy (Ef) adjusted to
zero] is plotted in Figure 2 for (a) δ-Bi11VO19 and (b) δ-Bi11VO18 and for respective supercells in (c,d). The
l-DOS plot for other systems can be found in Supporting Information (S4). The band gap is found to vary from 1.8 to
2 eV with vanadium doping. As shown in Figure 2, dominant contributions from O 2p, Bi 6s,
and V 3d states are mostly located between −6 and 0, −12
and −8, and 1 and 2 eV, respectively with significant hybridization
of these states. In case of δ-Bi11VO19, the VB is found to be mostly contributed by p states of O with
significant but comparatively small contribution from Bi 6s and 6p
states. Larger contribution of Bi 6s states is found to be between
−10 and −8 eV below Ef,
which are composed of highly polarized lone pair electrons, consistent
with earlier reports for bismuth oxide systems.33 In the energy range −6 eV to Ef, major contributions from Bi 6p and O 2p states, along with
small contribution of V 3d states, are observed. The CB minimum is
mostly contributed by degenerate d states of V at around 2 eV. The
contribution of Bi 6p and O 2p states are found to be small at the
CB edge and it is found to increase rapidly at higher energies. The
l-DOS landscape of the δ-Bi44V4O76 structure is found to be similar to the Bi11VO19 structure except that degeneracy of V 3d states is lifted which
reduces the effective band gap to 1.65 eV. For δ-Bi11VO18, the entire l-DOS landscape is found to shift to
lower energy as shown in Figure 2c,d. Significant but small numbers of oxygen states
are found in the forbidden region; Ef shifts
toward the CB, resulting in reduction in the band gap significantly.
Similar results are found for higher concentrations of V doping (refer Supporting Information S4). To investigate these
states in the forbidden region, l-DOS of first neighboring Bi and
O atoms to V is plotted as shown in Figure 3a, whereas the l-DOS for the rest of the
Bi atoms of the unit cell is plotted in Figure 3b. It is clear from these plots that the
decrease in the band gap is due to distorted first and second nearest
neighbors at the doped site. Hence, it is concluded that on V doping
in bismuth oxide, the decrease in the band gap is due to local distortion
at the V-doped site, while the band gap is found to increase with
additional O atom around the V site because of interaction with these
local first nearest neighbor Bi atoms. The calculated band gap of
Bi11VO19 of value ∼1.65 eV is in agreement
with the experimental results.

δ-Bi44V4O72 systems. Respective
Fermi energies are

The distortion of VO4 tetrahedron is known to cause
centers of positive and negative charges to separate, resulting in
an internal electric field. This effect is essential for the separation of electron–hole pairs,
which enhances the photocatalytic property.34,35 The electron transitions are either from the top of VB to CB or
from the top of VB to the impurity states (V 3d) and from the impurity
state to CB, which reduces the effective band gap. The narrowed band
gaps help the transmission of photogenerated electrons from V 3d states
to Bi 6p states, which shows a red shift of the light absorption region,
enhancement of photocatalytic activity, and improvement of the quantum
yield of the Bi11VO19.

2.2 Experimental
Results
In the photocatalysis
study, the crystal structure is one of the most important factor to
enhance the photocatalytic activity. According to our theoretical
results, we doped vanadium at the bismuth site. To confirm the theoretical
predictions, we characterize the sample mainly by XRD, VBS, and XAS.
Our calculated crystallographic parameters are in good agreement with
the theoretical results. A slight difference occurs because the experiments
are carried out at room temperature while the theoretical calculations
are at 0 K.

Figure 4 shows the XRD pattern of the Bi11VO19 nanoparticles obtained at room temperature along with the Rietveld
refinement method using FULLPROF software (pseudo-Voigt function)
of diffracted peaks of Bi11VO19. It indicates
the crystalline phase with fluorite type cubic symmetry having space
group Fm3̅m. There are no
indications of secondary or impurity peaks observed in the XRD pattern.
The lattice parameters of Bi11VO19 determined
at room temperature are a = b = c = 5.56 Å with unit cell volume = 171.88 Å (PDF2
no. 45-0363), which is consistent with our theoretical (a = b = 5.55, c = 5.39 Å with
total volume = 166.03 Å) results and an earlier report.14 The estimated average particle size is in the
range of 30–35 nm, determined using Scherrer’s formula.

Figure 4 XRD pattern
of Bi11VO19 nanoparticles.

The microstructures were characterized by TEM images as shown
in Figure 5. The TEM
micrographs
demonstrate that the morphology of Bi11VO19 is
spherical in nature. The spherical nanoparticle size having a diameter
of ∼36 nm is analogous with the average particle size calculated
using XRD. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern with
rings confirms the polycrystalline nature of Bi11VO19 nanoparticles. The observed d spacing value
of 0.326 nm is in good agreement with the lattice spacing 0.320 nm
for the family of planes (5 1 1) of fluorite type cubic Bi11VO19.14 The inset of Figure 5c shows inverse FFT
of the selected area of the Bi11VO19 nanoparticle
which reveals sharp and clear lattice fringes, confirming the crystalline
nature of the synthesized particles. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX) spectra confirm the elemental composition with the average Bi/V
ratio to be 10.92, which is close to the stoichiometric value of the
chemical formula of Bi11VO19. The scanning electron
microscopy and EDX data are incorporated in Supporting Information (S5). The elemental mapping shows the homogeneous
distribution of Bi, V, and O in the Bi11VO19 compound (S5).

particle size distribution, (c) high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) images, and (d) SAED pattern of Bi11VO19 nanoparticles.

The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurement
performed
to determine the specific surface area. The measured BET has the average
pore size, specific surface area, and pore volume of Bi11VO19 is about 6.44 Å, 10.05 m2 g–1, and 0.039 Å, respectively. The N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherm of Bi11VO19 nanoparticles perform at
77 K reveals hysteresis loop with adsorption desorption branches at
high relative pressure. The IUPAC classification of adsorption isotherm
shows the physisorption isotherm categorized as type IV, which represents
mesoporous nature and the clear advantage of degrading organic pollutants
in water (S7).

Diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy (DRS) shows a sharp absorption
edge in the visible region. The band gap of Bi11VO19 nanoparticles is estimated from the absorption edge by the
Wood Tauc plot36 and is found to be 2.26
eV, which is significantly narrower than the reported Bi3+ compounds such as α-Bi2O3 (2.8 eV),37 β-Bi2O3 (3.4 eV),38 t-BiVO4 (2.9 eV),2 and β-Bi2Mo2O9 (3.06
eV).39

The photochemical property
of semiconductor materials was studied
using photoluminescence (PL) spectra. The PL emission originated from
the recombination of the excited electron and holes of the semiconductor.
A sharp blue green emission band centered at 484 and 583 nm can be
observed which is directly related to the charge transfer with the
VO42 and VO52 group, respectively
(DRS and photoluminescence spectra included in Supporting Information S8 and S9, respectively).

The
bonding states in the coordination polyhedral of nanoparticles
are probed by Raman spectroscopy to analyze local crystal structures. Figure 6 represents a deconvoluted
Raman spectrum of Bi11VO19 nanoparticles excited
by a green (532 nm) laser source. The major deconvoluted Raman vibrational
spectrum has five bands at 307, 368, 703, 824, and 890 cm–1. The distinct V–O stretching frequencies are known to be
in the range of 650–950 cm–1. The stretching
mode at 824 cm–1 and the weak band at 703 cm–1 are assigned to the symmetric Ag νs (V–O) and asymmetric Ag νas (V–O)
stretching modes, respectively. According to the literature, the deconvoluted
peak observed at tail of high frequency, 890 cm–1, can be assigned to vibration mode of V–O bonds of distorted
VO5 trigonal bipyramids.40 The
bands at 307 and 368 cm–1 are assigned to asymmetric
and symmetric bending vibrations of the VO4 tetrahedron,
respectively. The V–O bond length by the Raman stretching frequencies
is determined by Brown and Wu, Franklin and Wachs empirical equations
(ν = 21 349 × exp(−1.917R), where ν is the Raman shift in cm–1 and R is the V–O bond length in Å).41,42 The calculated V–O bond length of symmetric V–O stretching
mode at 824 cm–1 is 1.70 Å and for 890 cm–1 the bond length is 1.66 Å. The calculated average
bond length for VO5 is larger than VO4 complex;
hence, the strong peak is assigned to VO5 stretching whereas
the weak peak is assigned to VO4 in close agreement with
reported VO424 stretching but
is in contradiction with the results of Attos et al.40 According to our theoretical calculation, the bond length
from the strong peak corresponds to the VO5 stretching
mode, whereas the weak peak at higher wave number gives the VO4 contribution, which is in close agreement with reported VO43– stretching mode.24 It is to be noted that the area under the peak at 890 cm–1 (assigned to V–O bonds VO4) is very small in comparison
to the area under the peak at 824 cm–1 (assigned
to V–O bonds of distorted VO5). This fact may be
a result of VO4 residing near the surface of nanoparticles
and O-excess trigonal bipyramids VO5 in the core of nanoparticles.43

Figure 6 Deconvoluted Raman spectra of Bi11VO19 nanoparticles.

The XPS spectrum of Bi11VO19 reveals better
understanding of the chemical states of the present compound on the
photocatalyst surface as shown in Figure 7. The full survey confirms the presence of
Bi, V, and O elements in the sample. The XPS spectra exhibit the characteristic
spin–orbit splitting of Bi states into 4f7/2 and
4f5/2 and V into 2p3/2 and 2p1/2.
The peak signals of Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 states
are observed at the values of binding energies 158.6 and 163.9 eV,
ascribed to the Bi3+ state, which is consistent with the
reported data.44 The binding energy separation
of states corresponding to Bi 4f peaks is at 5.32 eV, which is also
consistent with reported spin–orbit splitting measured in Bi2O3 and Bi11VO19 nanoparticles
by the Pechini method.14,45Figure 7c shows the states of V 2p included regions
2p3/2 and 2p1/2 at binding energies 515.7 and
523.1 eV, respectively, with spin–orbit splitting of 7.4 eV
signifying the 5+ state of V. The binding energy values are well-matched
with the reported values for vanadates (V5+) in LiNiVO346 and BiVO447 compounds, signifying that the V5+ ions are dominant in the present Bi11VO19 compound.
The peak for oxygen 1s state occurs at the binding energy of 529.3
eV, confirming the oxygen to be in the O2– state
which is related to Bi–O or V–O chemical bonding in
Bi11VO19.

Figure 8 demonstrates
the normalized VB photoemission spectra of Bi11VO19 nanoparticles recorded for the incident photon energy of 40 eV.
It clearly shows contribution due to V 2p derived states in the VB
photoemission spectra,48 which is consistent
with our theoretical calculations. As shown in Figure 8, the VB spectrum is deconvoluted with six
peaks by using the XPSPEAK 41 software. The spectrum of Bi11VO19 nanoparticles contains six features, marked as A,
B, C, D, E, and F at 1.16, 3.22, 4.77, 6.31, 8.29, and 10.27 eV, respectively.
The O 2p dominated VB is observed between 0 and 5 eV with respect
to the highest occupied state, with additional peaks above 8 eV due
to Bi 6s states. Features A and B are related to the unhybridized
O 2p mixed with Bi 6s states and the O 2p derived states. Features
C and D show the hybridized O sp2 to V 3d states near the
binding energy at 4.77 and 6.31 eV, respectively. The Bi 6s contribution
is largely confined to the bands appearing between 8 and 10 eV (features
E and F). The binding energies
of all features are well-consistent with calculated DOS and previously
reported data.33,49−52 It is to be noted here that although
the composition remains almost the same, the present study indicates
that the phase is extremely temperature-sensitive due to inherent
mobility of oxygen ions and available O vacancy sites. This also presents
the possibilities of use of the present compound in high-temperature
ionic conductivity devices. The inset of Figure 8 shows the threshold energy of the Bi11VO19 sample to be of value 1.26 eV, implicating
more positive VB top. In the photocatalytic activity, the O2 evolution mainly refers to the behavior of hole on the VB. Positive
threshold, deeper potential of VB top in Bi11VO19, is helpful for O2 evolution.52

view near 0 eV.

Soft X-ray absorption
study gives the fundamental electronic structure
of the unoccupied states within the CB at the V L-edge and O K-edges
of Bi11VO19. In the XAS study, by considering
the orbital selection rules (Δ ± l), the
V L-edges offer probes of 2p to 3d and the O K-edge 1s to 2p excitations.
In this bismuth vanadate system, the CB mainly consist of hybridized
antibonding V 3d states with antibonding O sp2 states.
The strong characteristic of the Bi 6p state is detected in the upper
region of CB. In case of bismuth vanadate, the V L and O K-edges are
observed to be partially overlapping. The combined experimental V
LIII absorption edge and O K-edge spectrum of Bi11VO19 fitted with Voigt functions is shown in Figure 9a,b. The deconvoluted
Voigt functions of core-hole deconvoluted with instrument broadening
for the V L-edge reveals four peaks A, B, C, and D at 515.9, 517.1,
518.0, and 518.9 eV, respectively, which have originated from the
ligand field splitting of V 3d states. The first two peaks A and B
show the triplet states originating from atomic multiplet effects,
which shows transition from occupied 2p3/2 states to unoccupied
3d states of V5+.51,52 The XAS spectra give
evidence of a distorted tetrahedral environment of V5+ in
the fluorite type cubic Bi11VO19.53

Figure 9 X-ray absorption spectrum measured in total electron yield
(TEY)
mode at (a) V LIII and (b) O K edges.

The O K-edge absorption spectrum of Bi11VO19 nanoparticles involve transition from occupied 1s core levels
to
empty O 2p states as shown in Figure 9b. The results of O K-edge of XAS show perfectly deconvoluted
five peaks located at binding energies of 529.8 (peak A), 531.1 (peak
B), 532.6 (peak C), 533.6 (peak D), and 534.8 eV (peak E) values,
which are mainly contributed by unoccupied metal states hybridized
with oxygen valence states. The characteristic peaks at 529.8, 531.1,
and 532.6 eV reveal the O 2p–V 3d hybridization, and it is
in agreement with the tetrahedral crystal field splitting of V eg and t2g states. The O K-edge data are consistent
with density functional theory (DFT) predictions of Bi 6p orbital
contributions to upper CB. Peaks D and E (533.6 and 534.8 eV, respectively)
are assigned to the contribution from Bi 6p states.

The relative
positions and qualitative variation of all experimentally
observed states are in excellent agreement with the present theoretical
results, confirming the presence of V-doped Bi2O3 in Bi11VO19 in the δ-phase. The vanadium
doping on the Bi site in δ-Bi2O3 affects
the energy states and distribution of electrons in orbitals of VB
and CB. This leads to the decrease in the electron and hole effective
masses.38 The doping of V creates some
impurity states both as acceptor and donor electrons, which decrease
the band gap. This results in red shift in photon absorption which
can enhance the utilization rate of photon energy. The impurity levels
act as not only acceptor but also the donor of electrons. In the band
energy, the impurity level formed by V can help electrons in VB to
absorb photons with small energy and to jump into the impurity levels
near CB. The narrow band gap increases the utilization rate of photon
energy in the visible region, which enhances the degradation rate
of MB of vanadium doped δ-Bi2O3.

The photocatalysis of Bi11VO19 nanoparticles
is observed by degradation of MB under visible light irradiation.
The change in the MB absorption (λ = 672 nm) under visible light
irradiation is shown in Figure 10. The absorption peak of MB solution exhibits a rapid
decrease in the absorption in the visible region and a blue shift
of absorption maximum. The UV–vis spectra show a decrease in
intensity with increasing irradiation time, (higher than δ-Bi2O3) which indicates decolorization of MB. No additional
peaks are found in the UV–vis spectra during the degradation
process, which signifies that no reaction intermediates are formed.
Under the visible light irradiation, the absorption maximum of MB
solution shifts gradually from 672 to 625 nm with color of dispersion
changing from blue to colorless. The spectral change associated with
hypsochromic effects of MB caused by N-demethylation under the visible
light and oxidative degradation occurs concomitantly.54

Figure 10 Absorption spectra of Bi11VO19 nanoparticles
in MB solution under visible light irradiation.

Under the visible light irradiation, the Bi11VO19 nanoparticle shows the excellent photodegradation rate for
MB within 105 min. In the photocatalytic mechanism, when visible light
is incident on the nanoparticles, photoinduced electrons (e–) are ejected from VB to CB, and it generates the holes (h+) in the VB (Figure 11). Here, these
holes react with adsorbed water on the surface of Bi11VO19 nanoparticles to form highly reactive hydroxyl radial (OH•), whereas O2 forms superoxide anion radicals
(O2•–) which act as an oxidizing
agent or an additional source of OH. These radical can degrade MB
dye effectively into nontoxic organic compounds. The photocatalytic
reaction mechanism of Bi11VO19 is given below              

Figure 11 Schematic of the photocatalytic mechanism
of Bi11VO19.

The MB degradation rate (Ct/C0) as a function of irradiation
time for Bi11VO19 and δ-Bi2O3 calculated from Figure 10 is shown in Figure 12a,b, where C0 and Ct are the initial
MB concentration and visible light irradiation concentration at time
(t), respectively. In the dark condition, MB is found
to be stable and the degradation rate was very less. For comparison,
the photocatalytic performance of δ-Bi2O3 was also investigated under the same experimental conditions. The
detail experimental results of δ-Bi2O3 can be found in Supporting Information (S10–S12). In comparison with the pristine sample, the δ-Bi11VO19 nanoparticles have a higher degradation rate
on account of smaller particle sizes as well as reduced band gap.
The degradation efficiency reaches of up to 80% in 105 min, whereas
the degradation efficiency of δ-Bi2O3 is
up to 35%. Photocatalytic activity is known to increase with decrease
in the particle size and increase in the surface area. The high surface
area is a key factor for the photocatalytic degradation of organic
compounds for adsorption of the compound. The kinetic constant (k) is calculated by using the pseudo-first order reaction
rate equation of ln(C0/Ct) = kt, where k is the kinetic constant of pseudo-first order reaction
rate equation. When the initial concentration of MB dye is low, the
pseudo-first order reaction rate equation can be used for quantitative
understanding of the reaction rates of the MB degradation. ln(C0/Ct) versus t plot shown in Figure 12b depicts a linear fit. The kinetic constant k, determined from this pseudo first order equation, has
a value of 0.07628 min–1, which is 23% higher than
the δ-Bi2O3 (0.00319 min–1). Some bismuth-based photocatalyst are reported to have the pseudo-first
order kinetic constant to be lower, such as BiVO4 film
(0.0138 min–1),55 nano-BiVO4 (0.629 × 10–3 min–1),56 Bi7VO13 (0.0263
min–1),57 and Bi11VO19 by the Pechini method (0.00242 min–1).14 In comparison, our results show a
more efficient photocatalytic activity. The Bi11VO19 nanoparticles synthesized using the thermal plasma technique
having a large effective surface area and tuned electronic structure
along with positive threshold energy of VB top are responsible for
enhanced photocatalytic activity.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we report
for the first time the successful synthesis
of Bi11VO19 nanoparticles using the high-temperature
thermal plasma method having particle sizes ∼35 nm with high
effective surface areas. The theoretical local ground state geometries
proposed from our calculations for V-doped δ-Bi2O3 and experimentally Rietveld fitted graph confirm the structure
of nanoparticles to be cubic fluorite type of δ-Bi11VO19 phase. The electronic structure of Bi11VO19 has been examined first time using both theoretical
calculations and experimental results. The VB is found mainly to be
composed of hybridized O 2p states with Bi 6s states, with small contribution
of Bi 6p states. The states in the energy range −10 to −8
are mainly contributed by Bi 6s states. The CB minimum mainly consists
of V 3d and small contribution of O 2p and Bi 6p states. Engineering
V 3d states of CB by substitutionally doping V at Bi sites leads to
band gap values in the visible region. The presence of extra O near
the V site is found to be essential for the observed band gap. The
band gap of Bi11VO18 is found to shrink because
of O 2p, Bi 6p, and Bi 6s states at V-doped site. In the Bi11VO19, the coordination environment of Bi ions is heavily
distorted because of the presence of stereochemically active Bi3+ 6s2 lone electron pair, rich oxygen ion vacancies,
presence of V–O complexes, and strong polarization fields.
The experimental results are supported by theoretical calculations
and enhance the understanding of the electronic as well as crystallographic
structure. Owing to engineered band gap and high effective surface
area on account of the present synthesis method, the Bi11VO19 nanoparticles show very high photocatalytic activity
for photodecomposition of MB dye under UV–vis light irradiation.
The calculated kinetic constant of the pseudo-first order reaction
rate has a value of 0.0763 min–1, which is highest
among reported δ-Bi2O3. This work provides
a large-scale high-yield simple way to prepare highly active visible
light-driven photocatalysts for the treatment of organic pollutants
of wastewater.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Computational Methodology
DFT58−60-based spin-polarized
electronic structure calculations are performed
at 0 K using the accurate plane augmented wave method61 as implemented in Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package.62−65 The exchange–correlation energy functional within generalized
gradient approximation is employed as given by Perdew et al.66,67 A cut off of 400 eV is used for the plane wave basis set. The ionic
positions are relaxed to minimize the total energy of system using
the conjugate gradient algorithm till the electronic energy and ionic
forces converge to within 10–4 eV and 0.02 (eV/Å),
respectively. Gauss broadening up to 0.001 eV is used to treat partial
occupancies by the Gaussian smearing scheme.

Ab-initio MD calculation
at single k point is performed within the canonical
ensemble approach at a constant temperature using the Nosè–Hoover
thermostat method. The system is kept at 773 K temperature for 4 ps
in steps of 1 fs to find the various local ground state geometries.

The stability of the system is characterized by comparing respective
cohesive energy (Ecoh) and substitutional
energy (Esub) calculated through eqs 1 and 2, where ϵi is the total energy
per atom of species i and ni is the number of atoms of species i in the bismuth vanadate system. ET and ETV are the total energies of the pristine and
V-doped bismuth vanadate systems, respectively. Higher positive values
for Ecoh and Esub indicate more stable structures. 1   2  

4.2 Synthesis
The nanoparticles of Bi11VO19 are synthesized by using a direct current
transferred arc thermal plasma reactor (DCTATPR) via the homogeneous
gas phase condensation process. The plasma reactor consists of a plasma
torch comprising of a water-cooled thoriated tungsten tip and a primary
anode made up of copper to initiate the plasma in the torch. After
ignition of plasma plume, it is transferred to a secondary anode using
dc voltage. The pellet is made by mixing Bi2O3 and V2O5 oxide powders (99.9% purity of Sigma-Aldrich
powders) with the atomic weight ratio of 1:1 (2 at. wt % vanadium
doped in Bi2O3) along with graphite powder so
as to make it conducting, and it is then put over the water-cooled
graphite secondary anode. These powders pelletized with 100 kg/cm2 of pressure using hydraulic press.

The system is evacuated
to base pressure of 10–2 Torr and purge with oxygen
to attain operating pressure. The plasma plume is then made to strike
onto the pellet. The reactor was then purged with argon gas for removing
or minimizing the impurities which are present in the reactor. The
reactor is filled with argon up to a desired operating pressure. In
the present synthesis, argon with nitrogen is used as plasma-forming
gas, whereas ambient gases are argon and oxygen. The pellet is placed
onto a graphite holder, which is placed over the water cooled graphite
electrode. The experimental operating parameters, schematic, and other
details can be found in Supporting Information (S1).

4.3 Characterization
The structure and
phase purity of Bi11VO19 nanoparticles are studied
using a X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS D8 ADVANCE diffractometer)
equipped with Cu Kα radiations (λ = 1.54 Å).
The UV–vis spectrum recorded in DRS spectrum mode is obtained
using a JASCO V-670 spectrophotometer. The HRTEM images and SAED patterns
are recorded using a HRTEM system (Tecnai G2 20 S-TWIN). The BET surface
area of Bi11VO19 was investigated by using nitrogen
adsorption–desorption measurements at 77 K. These nanoparticles
are further characterized with a Raman spectrometer (Renishaw InVia
micro-Raman spectrometer) using a 532 nm He–Ne laser. The chemical,
elemental, and local structural information is obtained using a XPS
technique with a monochromatized aluminum source (Kα line, 1486.6 eV, 14 mA, 9.5 kV) (PHI ESCA-5600). The chamber is
maintained at a pressure of 10–9 Torr during the
measurements. The VBS measurements are performed using angle integrated
photoelectron spectroscopy (AIPES) beamline on an INDUS-1 synchrotron
radiation source at the Raja Ramana Centre for Advanced Technology
(RRCAT), Indore, India. VBS data are collected using incident photon
energy at 40 eV and are calibrated with metallic gold foil. The XAS
measurements of V L-edge and O K-edge of Bi11VO19 nanoparticles are carried out in the TEY mode at the soft XAS beamline
of the INDUS-2 synchrotron radiation source at RRCAT, Indore and are
normalized by the incident photon flux taken from the photocurrent
from Au.

4.4 Photocatalytic Degradation
The photocatalytic
activity of Bi11VO19 nanoparticles is determined
by the decolorization of MB dye under the visible light irradiation.
The characteristic absorption peak of MB solution at 665 nm is used
to monitor the dye degradation reaction. The photocatalytic experiment
is performed under visible light (900 mW/cm2). The photocatalyst
(0.2 gm) is added into 100 mL of MB (10–5 M) solution,
and the experiment performed at ambient temperature. Before exposing
the sample to visible light irradiation, the mixture solution is stirred
for 30 min in the dark to reach the adsorption–desorption equilibrium
for MB. The suspension (2 mL) is collected after each 15 min time
interval to study the effect of irradiation. The concentrations of
MB are examined by taking the absorption spectrum of the collected
sample using the UV–vis spectrophotometer.
