A novel
ladderlike fused-ring donor, dithienocyclopentacarbazole
(DTCC) derivative, is used to design and synthesize three novel donor–acceptor−π–acceptor-type
organic dyes (C1–C3) via facile direct arylation reactions,
in which the DTCC derivative substituted by four p-octyloxyphenyl groups is served as the electron donor and the carboxylic
acid group is used as the electron acceptor or anchoring group. To
fine-tune the optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties
of the three dyes, various auxiliary acceptors, including benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole
(BT), 5,6-difluorobenzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole (DFBT), and pyridal[2,1,3]thiadiazole
(PT), are incorporated into the dye backbones. The results indicate
that all of the three dyes exhibit strong light-capturing ability
in the visible region and obtain relatively high molar extinction
coefficients (>31 000 M–1 cm–1) due to their strong charge transfer (CT) from donor to acceptor.
Moreover, theoretical model calculations demonstrate fully separated
highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital energy levels for the three dyes, which is helpful for efficient
charge separation and electron injection. Using the three dyes as
sensitizers, conventional dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based
on liquid iodide/triiodide redox electrolytes are fabricated. Our
results indicate that the BT-containing dye C1 affords the highest
power conversion efficiency of up to 6.75%, much higher than that
of the DFBT-containing dye C2 (5.40%) and the PT-containing dye C3
(1.85%). To our knowledge, this is the first example reported in the
literature where the DTCC unit has been used to develop novel organic
dyes for DSSC applications. Our work unambiguously demonstrates that
the ladderlike DTCC derivatives are the superb electron-donating blocks
for the development of high-performance organic dyes

1 Introduction
Dye-sensitized
solar cells (DSSCs) as a kind of clear-energy device
have attracted worldwide attention due to their great potential in
low-cost fabrication of highly flexible, large-scale energy conversion
devices.1−7 Thanks to great efforts in innovative materials design and device
engineering, DSSCs have exhibited much enhanced power conversion efficiency
(PCE) recently.1−7 As the key part of DSSCs, sensitizers play a crucial role in light
capture, charge separation/recombination, and photovoltaic properties
of the devices.8−12 Generally, the sensitizers can be divided into two main categories:
metal organic complexes and metal-free organic dyes. Although metal
organic complexes, especially for zinc porphyrin13−18 and ruthenium polypyridine,19−21 have achieved superior photovoltaic
performance relative to metal-free dyes, their intrinsic drawbacks,
such as heavy metal toxicity, high cost, and difficulty in synthesis
and purification,2 would limit the further
development. Recently, great interest has arisen to develop metal-free
organic dyes owing to their tremendous advantages, including low production
cost, tunable structure, and facile synthetic procedure.22−24 So far, some metal-free sensitizers have obtained encouraging PCEs
of above 12%,25−27 which can be comparable to metal complex dyes. Undoubtedly,
the development of novel sensitizers is one of the most promising
approaches for further advances in photovoltaic performance as well
as understanding the relationship between materials structure and
performance.

As far as molecular design is concerned, current
mainstream strategy
for metal-free organic dyes is to construct donor−π–acceptor
(D−π–A) or donor–acceptor−π–acceptor
(D–A−π–A) configuration to ensure efficient
light capture and strong intramolecular charge transfer.28−32 Compared to D−π–A dyes, the properties of D–A−π–A-type
organic dyes can be readily adjusted by inserting an auxiliary acceptor
between the D and π units, which thereby endows them with more
flexible photoelectric properties. Moreover, this delicate molecular
modification can not only fine-tune energy-level structure and light
response region but also facilitate electron transportation from D
unit to anchor group.24 On the basis of
this strategy, current research interest for ideal D–A−π–A-type
organic dyes mainly focuses on the modulation of π-conjugated
aromatic donors,33−37 π-bridges,38−40 anchoring groups,41 auxiliary
acceptors,42,43 as well as solubilizing side
chains.44−46 Among them, the exploitation of novel π-conjugated
aromatic donors is considered to be the most versatile approach to
develop large numbers of high-performance organic dyes. Hence, further
development of novel aromatic donors for high-performance D–A−π–A-type
organic dyes is worthy of being studied.

Due to their highly
electron-donating nature and tunable modular
structure, dithienocyclopentacarbazole (DTCC) derivatives have been
widely utilized as the donor unit to develop a set of organic/polymeric
semiconductors for organic solar cells (OSCs) and organic field-effect
transistors (OFETs).47−50 Since the first report on DTCC-based polymeric semiconductor by
Hsu et al.,47 a series of DTCC-like aromatic
fused rings and their organic/polymeric semiconductors have sprung
up subsequently.50 Traditionally, they
have been used as p-type semiconductors in OFETs and fullerene-based
OSCs, which afford 0.001–0.14 cm2 V–1 s–1 hole mobilities and 3.7–4.6% PCE values.47,48 Our recent work reveals that, by embedding two strongly electron-deficient
3-(dicyanomethylene)indian-1-one terminal groups, the first n-type
DTCC-based organic semiconductor (DTCC-IC) has been successfully developed
for nonfullerene OSCs,51 which achieves
an encouraging PCE of 6.0% and a high electron mobility of 2.17 ×
10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1. Although great advances in OSCs and OFETs have been
made for DTCC-based semiconductors recently, there is no DTCC-based
organic dye reported to date that can be applied in DSSCs.

Compared
to the parent carbazole unit, our developed DTCC derivative
(see Figure 1) exhibits
much stronger electron-donating ability due to the incorporation of
two indenothiophenene units into the molecular backbone; moreover,
its unique 3D spatial structure (see Figure 1) caused by four aryl side groups would be
expected to reduce dye aggregation on TiO2 films and retard
interfacial charge recombination. On the basis of the discussion mentioned
above, we report the design, synthesis, and structural characterization
of three D–A−π–A-type DTCC-based organic
dyes (C1–C3, Figure 1), in which the ladder-type DTCC derivative substituted by
four p-octyloxyphenyl groups is used as the donor
unit and the carboxylic acid group is used as the electron acceptor.
To manipulate the optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties
of the three dyes, we use different electron-withdrawing units as
the auxiliary acceptors in the three dyes, including benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole
(BT), 5,6-difluorobenzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole (DFBT), and pyridal[2,1,3]thiadiazole
(PT). Investigation of the performance of DSSCs has demonstrated that
the DSSC devices fabricated from the BT-containing dye C1 achieves
the highest PCE value of up to 6.75%, which is much higher than that
of the DFBT-containing dye C2 (5.40%) and the PT-containing dye C3
(1.85%).

dyes.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
Synthetic
routes to the three DTCC-based organic dyes are illustrated in Scheme 1. Detailed synthetic
procedures and characterization data are provided in Supporting Information. Compound 3 was prepared via a Suzuki
coupling reaction of 9-octyl-2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9H-carbazole (1) and ethyl 2-bromothiophene-3-carboxylate
(2) in high yields (75%). Subsequently, a double nucleophilic addition
reaction of freshly prepared 4-(octyloxy)phenyllithium and compound
3 was performed to obtain an aromatic alcohol, which was then directly
converted to the ladderlike dithienocyclopentacarbazole (DTCC) derivative
via a Friedel–Crafts reaction. Additionally, a series of key
intermediates (aryl halides, 9–11) were prepared via Suzuki
coupling reactions of ethyl 4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzoate
(5) and compounds 6–8. After that, the DTCC donor was translated
to the D–A−π–A-type intermediates (12–14)
via direct arylation reactions (DARs) in moderate yields of ca. 40%.
It should be mentioned that this versatile DAR approach makes our
synthetic procedures more environmentally friendly and facile,52−54 which enables direct coupling reaction between the DTCC donors and
the aryl halides (9–11). Finally, the target organic dyes C1–C3
were obtained in high yields (>73%) by the hydrolysis of compounds
12–14. All of the dyes were purified by column chromatography
on silica gel and then recrystallized from acetone. The chemical structures
of all of the novel compounds were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight
(Figures S4–S34). Furthermore, the
structural regioregularity of compound 11 was confirmed by 1H–1H nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (Figure S22). The results reveal that no cross-correlation
peaks can be observed between the PT (H1) and phenyl group
(H2 and H3) protons (Figure S22), which thereby provides an evidence for the regioselective
cross-coupling between compounds 8 and 5. We thus assume that the
PT-containing dye C3 has a well-defined structural regioregularity.

2.2 Optical
Properties
The UV–vis
absorption spectra of the three dyes C1–C3 in diluted CHCl3 solutions (10–5 M) are presented in Figure 2a, and the relevant
data are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Figure 2a, three dyes exhibit a similar absorption feature with two
typical absorption bands in the ranges of 350–420 and 450–680
nm, respectively. The former bands can be attributed to a localized
aromatic π–π* transitions, whereas the latter ones
can be assigned to a charge transfer (CT) between DTCC donor and electron
acceptor.55−57 The CT peaks and the corresponding molar extinction
coefficients (ε) are observed at 516 nm (ε = 3.46 ×
104 M–1 cm–1) for C1,
509 nm (ε = 3.89 × 104 M–1 cm–1) for C2, and 568 nm (ε = 3.14 ×
104 M–1 cm–1) for C3
(Figure S1). The results indicate that
the incorporation of DTCC donor into the dye backbone can achieve
high ε values (>3.14 × 104 M–1 cm–1). Therefore, these dyes are expected to efficiently
capture light and enable high photocurrents in their DSSCs. Although
DFBT unit has much stronger electron affinity as compared to BT unit,
the CT peak of the DFBT-containing dye C2 still displays a slight
blue shift by ca. 7 nm. This blue-shifted feature can be ascribed
to the disruption of molecular planarity due to the introduction of
two large fluoro substitutes into C2, thereby resulting in larger
dihedral angle (−38.2°) relative to C1 (−35.1°),
which is demonstrated in theoretical model calculations in Figure 3. Moreover, a significant
red shift of about 52 nm is observed for the PT-containing dye C3,
as a result of the strong CT transfer and the enhanced molecular planarity
among the three dyes (Figure 3). The normalized absorption spectra on TiO2 films
are depicted in Figure 2b. Once anchored on TiO2 films, the CT peaks of C1, C2,
and C3 are determined to be 512, 498, and 551 nm, respectively. In
comparison to their solution spectra, all of the dyes show ca. 4–17
nm blue shift because of the deprotonation effect of the acid groups
binding with TiO2.11

2.3 Theoretical
Model Calculations
To
investigate the influence of various auxiliary acceptors on geometric
configuration and electron distribution, we performed density functional
theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. Herein, four
octyloxy groups in the dyes C1–C3 were replaced by four methoxy
groups to shorten calculation time. The optimized molecular structures,
as depicted in Figure 3, reveal that the four aryl side groups locate outside of the main
backbone, thereby forming a unique 3D backbone configuration. This
3D backbone feature is believed to suppress dye aggregation on TiO2 films and thus give high photovoltaic efficiency.11 For the three dyes, relatively small twisted
dihedral angles (<3.4°) can be observed between the DTCC unit
and the adjacent auxiliary acceptors. Compared to C1 (35.1°)
and C3 (4.7°), the DFBT-containing C2 exhibits larger dihedral
angles (38.2°) between the DFBT unit and phenyl group because
the backbone coplanarity of C2 is sharply disrupted by introducing
two large fluoro substitutes. However, due to the weak steric effect
between adjacent groups, the PT-containing dye C3 exhibits excellent
backbone coplanarity with the smallest twisted dihedral angles of
4.7°, which is much smaller than those of the BT-containing dye
C1 (35.1°) and the DFBT-containing dye C2 (38.2°). Although
a good backbone coplanarity will facilitate charge transfer, aggregation
of dyes on TiO2 films caused by coplanar backbone is also
enhanced. Thus, this feature generally leads to strong electron recombination
on the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, which thereby gives
partial explanation for the lowest PCE values of the C3-based DSSCs.
Moreover, as shown in Figure 3, for the HOMO orbitals of the three dyes C1–C3, the
electrons mainly distribute on the DTCC donors and also partly extend
to the auxiliary acceptors, whereas the LUMO orbitals dominantly delocalize
over the acceptor and the π-linker groups. This fully separated
HOMO and LUMO orbitals distribution can guarantee the efficient charge
separation and electron injection.11

2.4 Electrochemical Properties
Cyclic
voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed to study the electrochemical
properties and energy-level structures of the dyes C1–C3. Typical
CV curves and the corresponding energy-level diagram are provided
in Figure 4. The relevant
data are collected in Table 1. As shown in Figure 4a, three DTCC-based dyes exhibit one strong clear oxidation
couple. We note that the first oxidation potentials (Eox) of the dyes C1–C3, which correspond to the
HOMO energy levels, are determined to be 1.10, 1.17, and 1.14 V (vs
normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)), respectively; it should be mentioned
that all of these Eox values are externally
calibrated by the ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc, see Figure S3) couple and addition of 0.63 V to the
potential (vs Ag/AgCl).11 The observed
results reveal that the Eox values are
much more positive than those of iodide/triiodide (I–/I3–) redox couple (0.4 V vs NHE, Figure 4b), which provides
enough driving forces for dye regeneration from excited-state dye
to ground-state dye via capturing electron from I–/I3– redox couple. On the other hand,
the E0–0 energies of the dyes C1–C3,
which were determined from the intersections of the normalized absorption
and emission spectra, are calculated to be 2.14, 2.17, and 1.94 eV,
respectively. According to the empirical equation of Eox – E0–0, the
reduction potentials (Ered vs NHE) are
determined to be −1.04, −1.00, and −0.80 V, respectively.
Thus, for the three dyes, more negative Ered values are observed as compared to the conductive band (CB) of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs NHE, Figure 4a); moreover, the calculated energy-level differences
(Egap) between Ered and CB of TiO2 are ca. 0.54, 0.50, and 0.30
eV, which are much larger than that of the theoretical requirement
(Egap > 0.2 eV).58 Therefore, we assume that three dye-based DSSCs would conduct
an
efficient electron injection from excited dye into TiO2 conductive band. However, the low-lying Ered value of C3 relative to C1 and C2 reveals that its driving force
for electron injection may be less sufficient.

in CHCl3 solution. (b) Energy-level
diagram of the dyes C1–C3.

2.5 Photovoltaic Performance
To investigate
the photovoltaic properties of the dyes C1–C3, conventional
liquid DSSCs were fabricated and tested using I–/I3– redox couple as the electrolyte.
The detailed fabrication procedures are provided in Supporting Information. Figure 5a shows the typical photocurrent density–voltage
(J–V) curves of the dyes
C1–C3 measured under global AM 1.5G sunlight with irradiance
of 100 mW cm–2 at 298 K. All of the device parameters
are summarized in Table 2. For the BT-containing dye C1, the optimized DSSCs achieved an excellent
PCE of 6.2%, along with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 12.98 mA cm–2, an open-circuit
voltage (Voc) of 671 mV, and a fill factor
(ff) of 0.71. Compared to C1, the DFBT-containing dye C2 afforded
relatively lower PCE of 4.74% and recorded a disappointing Jsc of 10.44 mA cm–2, a slightly
dropped Voc of 653 mV, and a comparable
ff of 0.70. We assume that the reduced PCE value for C2 mainly results
from a 12.2% decrease in Jsc value as
compared to C1-based DSSCs. Although the PT-containing C3 obtained
a broad absorption band relative to C1 and C2, the optimized C3-based
DSSCs still gave quite low Jsc and Voc values (3.27 mA cm–2 and
562 mV, respectively), thereby leading to the lowest PCE of up to
1.42% among the three dyes. The reduced photovoltaic efficiency for
C3 may partly result from its unexpected dye aggregation and electron
recombination caused by its enhanced backbone coplanarity as demonstrated
in the DFT calculation above. Another explanation presumably can be
ascribed to its low-lying Ered (−0.80
V) and too small Egap (0.30 eV) between Ered and CB of TiO2, which make the
electron injection from excited dye to CB of TiO2 much
less efficient than those of C1 and C2. Upon coadsorbing with 5 mM
chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), both Jsc and Voc values of the C1–C3-based
DSSCs were further improved due to the suppression of dye aggregation
and charge recombination. Among the three dyes, C1-based DSSCs exhibited
the highest PCE of up to 6.75%.

incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of
the dyes C1–C3.

Table 2 Photovoltaic Performance of the Three
Dyes with/without CDCA
dyes	Jsc (mA cm–2)	Voc (mV)	ff	PCE (%)	
C1	12.98	671	0.71	6.20	
C2	10.44	653	0.70	4.74	
C3	3.27	562	0.77	1.42	
C1 + CDCA	14.00	685	0.70	6.75	
C2 + CDCA	10.91	685	0.72	5.40	
C3 + CDCA	4.19	580	0.76	1.85	
To further analyze Jsc value, we measured
the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra
of the C1–C3-based DSSCs. As shown in Figure 5b, both dyes C1 and C2 exhibited strong and
broad absorption response in the visible region with the absorption
onsets extended to ca. 700 nm, which enables both DSSC devices to
obtain strong light-capturing ability and high Jsc value. On the contrary, in the whole visible region, the
C3-based DSSCs showed a quite weak absorption response with a maximum
IPCE value of ca. 17%, thereby resulting in low Jsc values. On the other hand, in comparison to C2, the
C1-based cells displayed higher and broader IPCE values and achieved
IPCE values over 60% at 400–630 nm. In general, the IPCE spectra
have a positive effect on Jsc and PCE
of DSSCs; the highest IPCE values for C1 guarantee its highest Jsc and PCE values among the three dyes. After
the addition of 5 mM CDCA, the IPCE values of the three dyes were
slightly improved and hence leading to enhanced Jsc and PCE values compared to those of the DSSCs without
CDCA.

2.6 Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful technique
to study interfacial charge transfer in devices.11 Herein, to elucidate correlation of Voc, we performed the Nyquist plots and Bode plots of the dye
cells in complete darkness with a forward bias of −0.70 V and
a frequency region at 0.01–100 kHz, respectively. As shown
in Figure 6a,c, two
semicircles from left to right in the Nyquist plot are visible; the
small semicircles represent the impedances of the charge transfer
on the Pt electrode/electrolyte interface (RPt), whereas the larger semicircles are correlated to the interfacial
charge transfer resistances (RCT) on the
TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The larger semicircle in
theory means the larger RCT, generally
providing the slower electron recombination rate.11 For the DSSCs without CDCA, the radius of the large semicircle
increases in the order of C3 (20 Ω) < C2 (70 Ω) <
C1 (92 Ω) (Figure 6a,c), suggesting that the electron recombination rate increases in
the order of C1 < C2 < C3, which is consistent well with the Voc tendencies of C3 (562 mV) < C2 (653 mV)
< C1 (671 mV). In comparison to the DSSCs without CDCA, the addition
of CDCA has caused an increase of RCT at
the same forward bias for the C1–C3-based DSSCs, thereby leading
to enhanced Voc and PCE values.

Figure 6 Nyquist plots
(a, c) and Bode plots (b, d) of C1–C3-based
DSSCs with/without CDCA under a bias of −0.70 V in complete
darkness.

The electron lifetime (τ)
of the exited dyes can be associated
with the peak frequency (f) at intermediate-frequency
regions in Bode plots, which can be calculated from the equation of
τ = 1/(2πf).11 The smaller the charge recombination rate, the longer the electron
lifetime is, generally leading to improved Voc and Jsc values. As shown in
Bode plots (Figure 6b,d), the f values increase in the order of C1 (5.0
Hz) < C2 (5.8 Hz) < C3 (32 Hz). As a result, the τ values
increase in the order of C3 (5.0 ms) < C2 (27.5 ms) < C1 (31.8
ms). On the basis of the results observed above, the best performance
of the C1-based DSSCs mainly results from its strongest light-capturing
ability and smallest charge recombination rate compared to the other
two dyes. To further elucidate the effect of CDCA on photovoltaic
performance, we also studied the Bode plots of the DSSCs with 5 mM
CDCA. By comparison of the f values, we found that
coabsorbing CDCA led to the reduced charge recombination rate due
to the effective retard of dye aggregation, thereby providing higher
photovoltaic performance than that of the DSSCs without CDCA.

3 Conclusions
In summary, for the first time, a ladderlike
fused-ring donor (dithienocyclopentacarbazole
(DTCC) derivative) has been used to design and synthesize three novel
D–A−π–A-type organic dyes (C1, C2, and
C3) via facile direct arylation reactions. We have demonstrated that
the use of auxiliary acceptors (BT, DFBT, and PT) can effectively
manipulate the optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic performances
of the three dyes. Moreover, strong D–A interaction endows
the three dyes with strong intramolecular charge transfer and high
molar extinction coefficients of above 3.14 × 104 M–1 cm–1, thereby ensuring their strong
light-capturing ability. Investigation of DFT calculations reveals
that the well-separated HOMO and LUMO orbitals of the three dyes are
observed, which is helpful for efficient charge separation and electron
injection. Although the PT-containing C3 obtains a broad absorption
band relative to C1 and C2, larger charge recombination rate caused
by dye aggregation in TiO2 led to quite low Jsc, Voc, and PCE values. Under
AM 1.5G illumination, the BT-containing C1-based DSSCs afford the
best photovoltaic performance with a Voc of 671 mV, a Jsc of 12.98 mA cm–2, an ff of 0.71, and a PCE value of 6.20%. Upon the
addition of 5 mM CDCA, both the Jsc and Voc values are further improved due to the enhanced
electron life of the devices, which thereby provides an enhanced PCE
of 6.75%. Our findings indicate that the ladderlike DTCC derivative
donors have great potential to design broad novel organic dyes for
high-performance DSSCs.
