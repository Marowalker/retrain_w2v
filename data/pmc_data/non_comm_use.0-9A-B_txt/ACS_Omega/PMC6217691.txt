The
sorption of aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) and ammonia solutions
in keratin fibers and its subsequent effect on their mechanical performance
has been investigated. The diffusion kinetics of MEA into keratin
fibers for 0.1, 1.0, and 5 v/v % MEA in water at 30 and 50 °C
were found to exhibit two clear regimes of absorption behavior: a
linear Fickian diffusion regime for initial times up to 100 min, after
which a second slower uptake process was observed. Single fiber tensile
tests showed that the Young's modulus and the tensile failure
stress
for 5% MEA-treated fibers, compared to untreated fibers, were 25%
lower after 1 h of treatment and 50% lower after 9 h of treatment.
Aqueous treatments of 0.1 and 1% MEA, as well as 0.6 and 3% aqueous
ammonia, had no measurable effect on either Young’s modulus
or tensile failure stress for the fibers. Scanning electron microscopy
images and protein content analysis confirmed that keratin fibers
exposed to 5% MEA solution exhibited significant surface damage as
well as high levels of protein loss. This study confirms for the first
time the important damage hair treatments containing 5% aqueous MEA
can cause on keratin fibers.

Introduction
Because of an increase in the aging population,
and changes in
the perception of hairstyles, permanent artificial hair coloring has
become increasingly common for all ages and genders. It is therefore
not surprising that manufacturers of hair care products are evaluating
new dyes and alternative chemical technologies for permanent hair
dyeing, often with stronger and more chemically active treatments.
However, these active treatments are known to cause “damage”
to human hair fibers.1 These treatments
can also lead to irreversible hair loss and dermatitis in mice hair.2

In the last three decades, there has been
a significant growth
in our understanding of the chemical and physical properties of hair.
Hair is mainly composed of keratinous protein which is “65–95%
of the hair weight”, followed by water, lipids, pigments, and
trace elements.3 A fully grown hair consists
of the cuticle (10% of the fiber), cortex (88%), and medulla (2%).
However, the latter zone is sometimes absent in fibers with smaller
diameters.4 The complex morphology and
structure of hair are thought to be similar to other animal fibers
such as wool and is represented in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Substructures in a merino wool fiber.5

The three-dimensional long chains of keratin fibers are held
together
by covalent bonding, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic
interactions6 as well as significant levels
of cross-linking based on cystine groups. When these bonds are chemically
altered, the structure of the fiber, and therefore its stability,
changes. Both monoethanolamine (MEA) and ammonia are used as alkalizers
in hair coloring treatments. Alkalizers serve three important functions:
swell the hair fiber to allow better penetration of dye precursors,
generate the active peroxide species necessary for melanin bleaching
and dye formation, while also participating in the bleaching of melanin.7

A majority of the keratin proteins are
found in the cortex region
of hair, specifically the cortical cells. Attempts to disrupt hair
proteins, which are insoluble because of their cross-linked nature,
will necessitate the breaking of these cross-linked disulfide bonds
by either reduction or oxidation to form keratins or keratosis accordingly.8

A typical hair dye contains tint and developer
components.9 The dye reaction process involves
the slow oxidation
of primary coloring intermediates and the subsequent reaction with
the coloring couplers, such as m-aminophenol or resorcinol.
The tinting component is composed of alkalizing agents, coloring intermediates,
and couplers. Alkalizing agents such as ammonia or MEA neutralize
coloring primaries and swell the hair cuticle to facilitate the penetration
of the color pigments deeper into hair oxidizing composition. Both
aqueous ammonia and MEA are preferred hair-swelling agents for adjusting
the pH of peroxide hair oxidizing compositions.10 Reducing agents prevent the premature oxidation of coloring
intermediates and thereby stabilize the hair dye product until use.
The developer component is made up of an oxidant, usually hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2).11 It is therefore critical to understand the uptake of MEA into hair
fibers, the kinetics of diffusion, and its impact on fibers for product
design, safety, and performance of key hair care products.

There
is a solid understanding of the macroscopic structure of
keratin fibers and there has also been some progress in our understanding
of the mechanisms involved in the hair dyeing process. A recent review
highlights12 the current understanding
of permanent hair dyeing and natural hair color pigmentation processes.
Yet despite the general understanding of active hair dye chemistry,
the detailed impact of many of the commonly used chemicals on the
physical properties of hair is poorly understood.

The main interest
of this study is to develop an analytical method
to measure the uptake of MEA and aqueous ammonia by keratin fibers,
common active ingredients in many industrial applications, and to
understand their subsequent impact on the physical and mechanical
properties of hair. MEA is increasingly being used for setting and
coloring hair, and it is currently being used as a replacement for
ammonia because of ammonia’s unpleasant odor.2 One of the key challenges in replacing ammonia with MEA
is the higher percentage of MEA (in comparison to ammonia) required
to deliver the same bleaching effect, commonly referred to as the
lightening intensity.7 However, high levels
of MEA have been observed to cause a significant surface damage to
fibers.1 Comparing equimolar amounts of
MEA and ammonia (aq), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed
cuticle loss and further investigations on protein loss indicated
a higher level of damage caused by MEA than ammonia.2 This study did not investigate diffusion behavior and kinetics
of uptake for the active species, which is critical for a detailed
mechanistic understanding.2 It is therefore
crucial to understand the impact of damage caused by MEA and ammonia,
including the effects of concentration and temperature for specific
alkalizer treatment times.

The general chemical and physical
damages to the cuticles caused
by chemical treatments have been established by several researchers.13−15 Although there is an emerging understanding of dye diffusion pathways
and the factors influencing the process kinetics, published research
into the kinetics of diffusion of molecules from aqueous solutions
into hair for experimental times greater than 3 h is very limited.
A few studies have investigated diffusion behavior for experimental
times less than 100 min.16−22

Diffusion studies of different solutes in both wool and hair
fibers
have reported the following diffusion coefficients as summarized in Table 1.

One of the main reasons for lack of data on the uptake of MEA and
ammonia with hair is a lack of standard experimental methods. This
paper reports on a method developed for MEA uptake based on gas chromatography
mass spectrometry (GC–MS). However, ammonia (aq) is volatile
solute, and its sorption into hair was not detectable using the same
GC–MS methodology. For this solute, a GC thermal conductivity
detector (GC-TCD) was a chosen technique in order to detect the presence
of ammonia (aq) in solutions. The GC–MS method allowed the
determination of the diffusion kinetics for MEA at different experiment
solution conditions, 0.1, 1, and 5 v/v % at 30 and 50 °C, which
was compared with the performance with aqueous ammonia using the same
solution conditions. This investigation extends to understanding the
impact of these active chemicals on the mechanical properties of the
keratin fibers and provides supporting evidence on fiber damage as
visualized using SEM and as detected via protein levels.

Materials and
Methods
Materials
MEA (Sigma >98%), aqueous ammonia (5.0
N,
Fluka Analytical), European human head hair (International Hair Imports),
and deionized water were used in this study. The hair has not been
chemically altered prior to this experiment and is commonly referred
to as “virgin hair”.

Instrumentation: GC–MS
GC–MS analyses
were performed with Shimadzu GC–MS QP2010. The carrier gas
was He with a total flow rate of 43.4 mL/min, a column flow rate of
1.91 mL/min, a linear velocity of 50.0 cm/s, a purge flow rate of
3.0 mL/min at a pressure of 110.4 kPa, and a nominal split ratio of
20:1. Separation of the solute was achieved using a Restek RTx5 amine
capillary column (30 m long, 0.25 mm diameter, and 1 μm thickness)
(Restek Corporation, Bellefonte, PA) at temperatures of 250 °C,
for both injector and interface, and 200 °C, for the ion source
at a solvent cut time of 0.2 min. The initial oven temperature was
40 °C and set to increase at a rate of 6.5 °C/min until
75 °C. The final temperature of the oven was held at this temperature
for a further 1 min. Before starting the main uptake experiment, background
experiments were performed to establish the optimum GC–MS operational
configuration as described below.

Method: GC–MS
The GC–MS detector sensitivity
test was carried out to check if the detector is sensitive enough
to detect low concentrations of MEA. The MEA concentration calibration
curve was then obtained between 0.1 and 2.5 v/v % of MEA. Once this
calibration has been established, the aliquots were diluted to ensure
that the samples remained within the linear calibration range.

Once confidence was established on the GC–MS, the samples
were prepared for the analysis. Careful and systematic sample preparation
and preconditioning were required prior to the experiment for accurate
sample analysis. Hair fibers were rinsed with deionized water, and
any excess water from the hair was removed by gentle squeezing. Deionized
water (200 ± 0.16 mL) and the hair samples were prepared 12 h
before usage (n = 3). Hair, 2.5 g, was added to three
different Erlenmeyer glass flasks and left to soak in the deionized
water; the fourth flask was left as a control, that is, no hair. The
solution temperature was maintained at the required temperature for
each experiment. After 12 h when the hair was fully hydrated, a stock
solution of MEA was added to each vessel to make up the required concentration
(0.1, 1, and 5 v/v %). These flasks were maintained at either 30 or
50 °C. From the time at which MEA is initially added to each
vessel, 0.5 mL of aliquots was taken from the solution every 10 min
for the first hour and then at each hour for further 8 h and analyzed
for the MEA content by using GC–MS. Before taking liquid samples
(n = 3) to determine the MEA concentrations, the
vessels were gently shaken.

Instrumentation: GC-TCD
A GC-TCD
(6890N Agilent, UK)
with a maximum oven temperature of 450 °C, a capillary column,
and an automated injector (7683 series) were used. Although the purpose
of this study is to make a direct comparison on the diffusion behavior
of MEA and aqueous ammonia, because of the volatile nature of ammonia,
extra precautions had to be implemented during sample preparation.
Virgin hair (three samples, ∼1.5 g dry) was left to soak in
deionized water (10 min) and then added to Erlenmeyer flasks (100
mL) which were capped with Suba-Seals (37 mm). The three flasks were
filled with deionized water (109.5 g). A fourth reference flask was
capped with a Suba-Seal and filled with deionized water (114.5 g).
All flasks were left in an oven overnight at the required temperature.
Ammonium hydroxide solution was added to the vials, and aliquots were
taken in the same manner as the GC–MS method. However, because
of the volatility of ammonia, a few modifications had to be made to
the sample collection method. Aliquots were taken using a syringe.
Once the liquid sample was taken, it was replaced with equal volume
of deionized water. The collected samples with ammonia were kept in
the fridge (5 °C), to prevent further evaporation, prior to the
analysis on the GC-TCD equipment. Data were collected from Agilent
6890N with a TCD. To ensure the reliability of the data collected,
the water peak was used as a reference and the concentration for ammonia
in each sample was calculated by comparing the ratio of the NH3 peak to H2O peak areas.

Instrumentation: Dia-Stron
In order to determine whether
the chemical treatment methods used affected the tensile properties
of the hair, the wet tensile stress–strain curves were determined
for treated hair samples and compared to virgin hair samples (Figure 1). To measure the
diameters of dry hair fibers, a Dia-Stron automated diameter/tensile
tester MTT600 (Dia-Stron Limited, UK) was used. The diameter measurements
were carried out at 20 °C and 65% relative humidity. Hair fibers
(25 per sample and 30 mm long) were attached with two crimping ferrules
at both ends. The diameter measurement was carried out at several
planes along the fiber axis as the fiber is rotated. The elliptic
cross section of the fiber is calculated from short and long diameter
at each plane (averaged). To carry out these wet tensile measurements,
the fiber is soaked in water during the fiber testing at 25 °C.
Each fiber is slowly stained until it breaks at a constant crosshead
speed of 10 mm/min.

Instrumentation: SEM
A Hitachi S-3000N
scanning electron
microscope was used at 5 kV voltage. Hair samples were sputter-coated
prior to the measurement with 15 nm of gold.

Method: Protein
Loss
Approximately 0.5–0.56 g of hair tresses was
prepared and
distilled water was added (10× the mass of hair samples). The
samples were then shaken at 2500 rpm for 60 min. At the end of 60
min, the aqueous hair tress extract was then separated leaving the
hair samples behind. A working reagent was prepared by weighing 25
mL of bicinchoninic acid (BCA) reagent A with 0.5 mL of BCA reagent
B. The working reagent solution prepared was bright green. Then nine
standard solutions were prepared. The first standard solution was
prepared by adding 1800 μL of distilled water and 1200 μL
of albumin standard solution. Seven other standard solutions were
prepared by adding 1000 μL of distilled water and 1000 μL
of the albumin standard. The last solution was blank containing only
1000 μL of distilled water. A total of 25 μL of the standard,
25 μL of the hair tress extract, and 200 μL of the green
working reagent solution were then mixed for 15 s and kept at 37 °C
for 60 min. The solutions were analyzed for their protein content
by using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrometer.

Results and Discussion
For glassy biopolymers such as hair, both the solute concentration
gradient and swelling/relaxation of the biopolymers contribute to
the solute diffusion process. In this experiment, preswollen fibers
are used to negate the effect of swelling/relaxation of the fibers
on the diffusion rate of the penetrant molecules.

The concentration
of MEA was recorded using GC–MS from aliquots
taken in vials containing hair, and the resultant fiber uptakes have
been calculated. A decrease in the concentration of MEA in solution
is observed for all samples because of MEA uptake by the fibers. The
dimensionless uptake of solutes has been presented as a function of
the square root of time in Figure 2 for 30 °C. These dimensionless data are not dependent
on the actual MEA concentration.

Figure 2 Aqueous MEA uptake kinetics for 0.1, 1,
and 5 v/v % at 30 °C
over 9 h.

Fickian diffusion is observed
in Figure 2, with a
constant initial slope in the initial
uptake. All three concentrations exhibit a linear increase in the
first hour with the fibers taking up 70% of the solutes within the
first hour, followed by a gradual uptake in the remaining time for
30 °C at a second much lower slope, indicating a slower secondary
diffusion.

The dimensionless uptake data for the solutes shown
in Figure 3 for 50
°C show
a much more complex behavior. However, all four data sets exhibit
a common series of behavioral traits:For times <1 h, linear or initially linear Fickian
diffusion data are observed

For times
of 1–5 h, uptake is constant or quasi-constant

For times >5 h, some samples exhibited a second slower
uptake kinetic



Figure 3 Aqueous uptake kinetics for 0.1, 1, and
5 v/v % MEA and 3 v/v %
ammonia at 50 °C over 9 h.

For 1 and 5 v/v % MEA solutions at 30 and 50 °C, a quasi-equilibrium
was reached after an hour where almost no uptake was observed for
further 2–4 h. In the 5% MEA experiment, the second step of
the diffusion process is more pronounced for 50 °C, as shown
in Figure 4. Although
solution samples of the GC–MS analysis were collected over
9 h, a change in the concentration of MEA beyond the first hour was
not detected in the GC–MS for 0.1% MEA solutions. For the rest
of the concentration samples, the uptake at this second phase of diffusion
is linear where 20% of the solutes are taken up in a quarter of an
hour at 50 °C. The maximum absorption of MEA at this temperature
was found to be 0.78% mass MEA per gram of virgin hair.

Figure 4 Primary and
secondary diffusion steps observed for the MEA uptake
for 5 v/v % at 50 °C over 9 h fitted to a Fickian diffusion model
in an infinite cylinder (solid line).

Further uptake of solute molecules by amorphous keratin domains
after the initial quasi-equilibrium has been reached is shown to be
an indicator of a possible relaxation-controlled diffusion.23 Given sufficient time and a range of temperatures,
a behavior deviating from ideal Fickian diffusion to a relaxation-/swelling-controlled
sorption process is expected for a given penetrant.23 However, in this work, preswollen hair fibers (hair hydrated
overnight before adding MEA) have been used to minimize the impact
of swelling on the diffusion behavior. Further uptake of solutes by
the fibers over a long period of time shows that the experimental
time scales given, 9 h, were not long enough to reach the absolute
equilibrium.

For direct comparison with the data set for 5 v/v
% MEA, the equimolar
amount of aqueous ammonia was tested (3 v/v %). For aqueous ammonia,
the maximum solute absorption occurs at 240 min and following this,
the system begins to equilibrate (Figure 3). This is a similar time frame for the second-stage
uptake of MEA. Comparison of the diffusion behavior of aqueous ammonia
with that of MEA shows that under similar conditions, aqueous ammonia
solutions exhibit only one distinctive mode of absorption into the
studied hair samples. It can therefore be concluded that a one-stage
absorption mechanism is the most likely contender for aqueous ammonia
uptake for this experimental setup. Ammonia also shows a faster diffusion
rate than MEA at the same temperature compared with 5% MEA. This however
could also be due to the high volatility of ammonia from the solution.
Because of the difficulty of the experimental setup for ammonia, we
only present results for 3 v/v % at 50 °C.

Assuming the
fiber to be an infinitely long cylinder in an infinitely
large solute bath, the solute uptake process is controlled by the
rate of diffusion into the fiber and can be described by Wilson’s
equation24 1  Ct/C∞: ratios of the amount of diffusant
at time t and at equilibrium, r:
the radius of the fiber (35 μm), D: the diffusion
coefficient, α: the ratio of the diffusant in the solution and
in the fiber at equilibrium, qn: values for the roots .

Using eq 1, and the
experimental values for Ct/Cinf, the corresponding values for the
diffusion coefficients can be determined.

The diffusion coefficients
calculated in Table 2 are all of a magnitude similar to those
found for cation diffusion in wool at 50 °C and for acid diffusion
in hair at 32 °C, as listed in Table 1. At an elevated temperature, 50 °C,
a larger diffusion coefficient was observed for the initial step than
for the secondary uptake step at high MEA concentrations.

The amorphous keratin found
in the cuticle allows water and other
dyes to diffuse through, but it is more resistant to diffusion than
the cortex.25 However, in a short time
period, it is possible to observe the diffusion behavior of small
molecules penetrating through the fibers into the cortex. During the
diffusion process, the active molecules first penetrate the cuticle
and subsequently the cortex, which are chemically and morphologically
different. Table 3 shows
the distance of penetration for MEA molecules calculated using the
Einstein–Smoluchowski equation, D = L2/2t, where L represents the average distance travelled by the MEA molecules at
a given time t.

Examining the results reported in Table 3 with an average fiber diameter
of 70 μm
illustrates that the molecules have started to penetrate into the
cortex of the material within the first few minutes, and even faster
at higher temperatures.

Overall, increasing the initial concentration
of solutes in the
solution results in an increase in the final concentration of MEA
in the fibers as expected.

From Figure 4, it
can be seen that when the experimental temperature is raised to 50
°C, the apparent equilibrium uptake increases again introducing
a second stage of solute sorption into the fibers. Although there
is no reported explanation for the two-stage behavior observed here,
three possible explanations for the two-step diffusion/sorption of
MEA are suggested below. However, a detailed examination of these
factors is not considered in this current work.i. Diffusion of MEA
into elements of the
substructure, for example, crystalline fibrils

ii. Hydrolysis of the proteins. The thioester
linkage between the F-layer (18-methyleicosanoic acid) and the A-layer
protein is hydrolyzed

iii. Additional protein degradation at
the second stage



For scenario (i), the
initial uptake is due to penetrants diffusing
through the cuticle layer, followed by a second step where molecules
diffuse into the crystalline domains. However, as hair fibers have
a low surface area (less than 0.2 m2/g), adsorption on
the fiber surface will not be a dominant process for the observed
100 min.

For scenario (ii), at high MEA concentrations and temperatures,
as well as for long experimental times, a phenomenon is observed similar
to what was observed in relaxation chemistry: hydrolysis of peptide
bonds, lanthionine formation, and breakdown of S–S bonds, resulting
in a loss in tensile strength. This scenario anticipates that the
thioester linkage between the F-layer (18-methyleicosanoic acid) and
the A-layer protein has been hydrolyzed, removing the hydrophobic
surface barrier and creating sulfonate groups.26 Such reactions are likely to take place in the experiments
carried out in this study using solutions with a very high pH, a chemistry
well understood in the detergent industry where high pHs are used
to remove fats and greases. Possible reaction mechanisms that could
take place in keratin fibers due to the action of alkalinity have
been discussed in more detail.26

Scenario (iii) anticipates that more protein degradation occurs
at high MEA concentration and for longer time. For this scenario to
be accepted as a potential hypothesis for a two-step diffusion, a
difference in protein loss for different experimental times is expected.

Tensile
Properties
Hair damage is one of the major
consumer worries, and its property is often related to breakage, which
hinders hair growth. In order to determine whether the treatment methods
used in previous experiments affect the tensile properties of the
hair, the load–elongation curves of the chemically treated
fibers have been measured and compared to virgin hair samples.

Figures 5 and 6 show a clear difference in tensile properties between
“as received” virgin hair and “treated”
hair samples. The largest change in mechanical property is observed
for hair treated with 5 v/v % MEA, indicating the significance of
damage to the keratin fibers at high MEA concentrations. The data
of tensile properties correlate with the two-phase behavior observed.
There is no significant change with time for the hair treated with
ammonia, but for MEA-treated hair, the change is visible.

Figure 5 Single keratin
fiber wet mechanics: (a) break stress and (b) elastic
modulus for all samples treated at 50 °C.

Figure 6 Single keratin fiber wet stress–strain curves (prefailure)
for different treatments at 50 °C and 9 h (n = 20).

Figure 6 shows that
a steep increase in stress is observed up to 2.5% fiber extension
where yields commence, and then the fiber continues to yield until
it reaches ∼25% strain with minimal change in the yield stress
of 40–50 MPa. Both virgin hair and ammonia (aq)-treated hair
exhibit a similar stress–strain behavior. For MEA-treated fibers,
the yield region is observed at a lower stress, 20–30 MPa.
After 25% extension, the fiber stresses continue to increase until
a failure condition is reached. Both the yield and post-yield regions
indicate a typical viscoelastic behavior.27

It has been previously reported that the tensile properties
of
hair are mostly related to the cortex, not the cuticle.26 For a wet virgin hair, the Young modulus has
been reported to be in the regions of 1.5–2.0 GPa with a break/failure
stress of 192 MPa for a Caucasian hair.26,28 The wet tensile
properties of keratin fibers are related to the disulfide bonds and
higher concentrations of alkalizers that are known to cause tensile
damage. A study by Arai and co-workers reported on the mechanical
stability with a high number of cross-links.29 This presents a potential explanation for a reduction in tensile
strength when fibers are treated at high MEA concentration. The mechanical
properties reported here indicate that even when used alone, MEA has
a significant impact on the tensile property of hair. This observation
is no surprise as chemical treatments are known to cause damage on
hair, which can be reflected in keratin fiber tensile properties30

Further analysis to investigate the impact
of both MEA and ammonia
(aq) was carried out by comparing the protein loss of the samples.
The samples were taken both after 1 and 9 h immersion in the solutions.
The measurement was only carried out for the samples treated at 50
°C.

Figure 7 shows the
highest protein loss for the hair treated with MEA, which is fully
consistent with the chemical damage to the keratin structures which
might include hydrolysis. More interestingly, the hair treated with
MEA even for 1 h shows more protein loss than aqueous ammonia for
9 h. For long treatment times, the data show a linear increase in
protein loss for both types of treatments. Overall, these data show
more protein damage for MEA versus ammonia, which increases with time.
However, this increase in time is the same with both alkalizers.

Figure 7 Protein
loss comparison for ammonia and MEA-treated hair samples
at 50 °C.

There is visibly more
damage (Figure 8) caused
to the cuticle, where the highest
cystine content is found, because of MEA than ammonia, and higher
concentrations of alkalizers exacerbate this damage.

Figure 8 SEM images of (A) virgin
hair, (B) 0.6% aqueous ammonia, (C) 3%
aqueous ammonia, (D) 1% MEA, and (E) 5% MEA. All samples were treated
for 9 h in aqueous solutions at 50 °C.

The SEM figures (Figure 8) correlate with the protein loss, showing a more visible
cuticle loss for MEA versus ammonia. When the hair is subjected to
oxidative conditions and inevitably prone to damage, cysteic acid
levels are often measured to quantify the amount of damage to the
fibers. However, this method alone is not sufficient enough to quantify
the amount of damage caused to the fibers as it might not take account
of the different pathways hair damage can be measured. In this report,
further work has been done to quantify protein loss because of the
different hair treatments. Protein loss enables us to quantify the
oxidative damage.2

The SEM images
presented in Figure 8 and the protein loss data in Figure 7, in addition to the tensile test measurements
provided, confirm the significance of oxidative damage by both MEA
and aqueous ammonia at different concentrations and experiment time
frames.

Conclusions
Experimental studies
on hair have indicated a significant change
in mechanical properties when exposed to a high aqueous concentration
of MEA. A GC–MS technique has revealed a new key insight into
the diffusion behavior of MEA, with a two-step diffusion/sorption
process being observed that has not been reported before. Diffusion
coefficients have been calculated to be a magnitude of 10–10 cm2/s. A comparison with aqueous ammonia uptake showed
a smaller uptake than MEA. MEA-treated hair (5%) has shown the largest
decreases in tensile properties compared to other treatments as well
as untreated hair samples. It is however possible to use MEA at low
concentrations without causing measurable damage. However, high concentrations
such as 5% MEA will result in keratin fibers that exhibit significant
damage, lower tensile mechanical properties, and visual surface damage.
