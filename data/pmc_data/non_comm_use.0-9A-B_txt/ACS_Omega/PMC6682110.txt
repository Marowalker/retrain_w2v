Repetitive DNA sequences are abundant
in the genome of most biological
species. These sequences are naturally “preamplified”,
which makes them a preferential target for a variety of biological
assays. Current methods to detect specific DNA sequences are based
on the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which relies
on target amplification by Taq polymerase and uses
a fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based probe. Here,
to rapidly detect a repetitive DNA sequence, we combine a highly sensitive
magnetic modulation biosensing (MMB) system and a modified double-quenched
FRET-based probe. The high numbers of copies of the female-specific XhoI sequence of the domestic chicken (Gallus
gallus), combined with the low background fluorescence
levels of the modified double-quenched probe and the high sensitivity
of the MMB system, allow us to determine the chick sex in ovo within
13 min, with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Compared to quantitative
PCR, the presented assay is 4–9 times faster. More broadly,
by specifically tailoring the primers and probe, the proposed assay
can detect any target DNA sequence, either repetitive or nonrepetitive.

Introduction
Shaped through billions of years of evolution,
the genomes of almost
all living creatures—from bacteria to plants and animals—have
accumulated substantial quantities of repetitive nucleic acid sequences.1−3 These sequences can appear throughout the genome in exceptionally
high numbers of copies, ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands
of repetitions. They are divided into groups, primarily based on their
size, location, number of copies, and mobility.3 Some of them (e.g., ribosomal genes) are fully functional
genes, highly conserved, and serve a specific purpose.4 Others have no specific function and may be either mobile
or dispersed through the entire genome (e.g., transposable elements)
or distributed in blocks in one or more defined locations on the chromosomes
(e.g., tandem repeats). Some structural elements of the chromosomes,
such as centromeres and telomeres, are also composed of short repetitive
elements.3

To date, significant parts
of the genomes that contain long stretches
of repetitive motifs remain poorly mapped.5 These areas are frequently regarded as “junk” DNA
and are either marked as “undefined” or completely omitted
from the genome map. Nevertheless, apparent lack of function does
not necessarily mean that such junk DNA is entirely useless. For instance,
modern forensic science extensively relies on the detection of short
tandem repeats polymorphism for DNA “fingerprinting”6 and paternity tests.7 Moreover, specific repetitive DNA sequences can be used to discriminate
closely related species8 and to perform
sex-typing of birds.9

Specific DNA
sequences are commonly detected using conventional
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is highly sensitive, but presents
several challenges. First, conventional PCR is very slow (e.g., target
amplification and analysis of the results by gel electrophoresis takes
up to 2.5 h).10 Second, possible polymorphisms
of the target sequence or amplification of unrelated sequences similar
in length to the target can result in false identification.11 Third, when repetitive sequences are used as
targets for PCR amplification, amplicons of multiple lengths are expected,
thereby making it difficult to conclusively interpret the results.12,13

A TaqMan quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay overcomes some of these
challenges.14 Unlike conventional PCR,
a TaqMan assay requires three independent binding events (two primers
and a probe), which significantly improves the specificity of the
assay and reduces the probability of false identification. In a TaqMan
assay, a fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based probe
(i.e., a short oligonucleotide labeled with a fluorescent molecule
at the 5′ end and a quencher molecule at the 3′ end)
is degraded by advancing Taq polymerase, which physically
separates the fluorescent molecule from the quencher. Subsequently,
the fluorescent signal increases with each PCR cycle. Direct optical
detection of the fluorescent signal eliminates the need for additional
analytical steps, such as gel electrophoresis, and thereby shortens
the duration of the test.

In general, in a standard FRET-based
probe, the fluorescent and
the quencher molecules are located 20–23 bases apart. Hence,
the quenching efficiency, which is inversely proportional to the sixth
power of the distance between the fluorescent and quencher molecules,
is low.15 Even in its quenched state, a
standard FRET-based probe has a relatively high fluorescent background.
Shortening the probes (e.g., to 15–18 bases) may improve the
quenching efficiency, but will compromise the probe specificity. Recently,
Wilson et al. have employed a novel FRET-based probe, termed a double-quenched
ZEN probe,16,17 which uses two quenchers instead
of a single quencher, thus reducing the distance between the fluorophore
and the quencher to only nine bases. Compared to the standard single-quenched
FRET probes, the double-quenched ZEN probe has ∼90% lower background
fluorescence, which facilitates the detection of target DNA sequences
and requires one to two fewer amplification cycles.17

Here, we propose a modified double-quenched ZEN probe
that further
reduces the number of PCR cycles required to detect repetitive nucleic
acid sequences. The modified double-quenched probe has a biotin on
the same 5′ nucleotide as the fluorescent molecule. Hence,
following separation of the fluorescent molecule from the quenchers
by Taq polymerase activity, the fluorescent molecule
remains attached to the biotin molecule. At this point, streptavidin-coupled
magnetic beads are added to the sample and capture the biotinylated
fluorescent molecules. To increase the sensitivity of fluorescence
detection, an oscillating external magnetic field gradient is applied
to the sample, attracting the beads from the entire solution volume
and concentrating them into a small detection area. To separate the
fluorescent signal from the background noise of unbound fluorescent
molecules, the oscillating magnetic field gradient moves the bead
aggregate from one side to other, in and out of a laser beam. The
resulting flashing signal is clearly distinguishable from the constant
background noise, and the amplitude of the oscillating signal is proportional
to the concentration of target molecules. Aggregating the magnetic
beads attached to target molecules and modulating them to increase
sensitivity are the basic principles of a novel optical detection
technology, termed magnetic modulation biosensing (MMB). While the
principles and characteristics of the MMB system have been demonstrated
before,18,19 it has never been used to detect repetitive
DNA sequences or to work with a modified double-quenched probe.

To demonstrate the advantages of the modified double-quenched probe
in rapid and sensitive detection of repetitive DNA sequences, in this
work, we target the female-specific repetitive sequences of the chick
embryo and address the challenges of chick sexing in ovo. In most
bird species, visually determining the sex of newly hatched chicks
is challenging.20 This problem is particularly
acute in the laying hens industry, where male chicks are sorted out
and disposed of on the day of hatching.21 The cruelty of the methods utilized for the disposal of male chicks
has created a widely discussed ethical problem.22 This issue can be resolved by determining the chick’s
sex in ovo in the early stages of embryonic development and then disposing
of unhatched eggs containing male embryos.

In birds, males are
the homogametic sex, having two Z chromosomes,
whereas females are the heterogametic sex, having one Z chromosome
and one W chromosome.23 The majority of
the W chromosome (up to 90%) is occupied by an extremely high number
of repetitive sequences.24,25 Because repetitive
sequences of the W chromosome (e.g., XhoI, EcoRI) are found in more than 5000 copies per female genome,
they can be used as potential targets26 for a chick sexing assay. Compared to the standard ZEN probe, the
modified double-quenched probe combined with the MMB detection technology
allows using four to five fewer PCR cycles and can reliably detect
the chick sex in less than 15 min.

Results and Discussion
The results of adult bird sexing by detecting a fragment of the XhoI repetitive sequence using an MMB system and a qPCR
system are presented in Figure 1. Using the MMB system, the fluorescent signal after five
amplification cycles was similar for both male and female samples.
However, after 10 amplification cycles, the fluorescent signal was
100% higher for females than for males. The extrapolated threshold
that allows discrimination between male and female birds is ca. 6–8
PCR cycles (Figure 1a). Using the qPCR system, a significant difference in signal between
males and females is detected after at least ca. 12–13 cycles
(Figure 1b). No significant
signal amplification is observed for any of the male or negative control
samples.

Figure 1 Adult bird sexing by detecting a fragment of the XhoI repetitive sequence using modified double-quenched probes. Fluorescent
signal as a function of the number of PCR cycles, measured using (a)
the MMB system and (b) qPCR system. The total number of samples tested
was 12. Shown are five adult females (solid red), five adult males
(dashed green), a negative control without target DNA (dashed violet),
and a negative control without Taq polymerase enzyme
(dotted orange). The error bars for the male and female samples represent
the standard deviation of five independent samples (n = 5). The error bars for the negative controls represent the standard
deviation of three measurements (n = 3).

Sex determination of 16 chick embryos samples by
conventional PCR,
which is the gold standard of molecular-based chick sexing, is presented
in Figure 2. All of
the amplified sequences were at the expected size of the female-specific
nonrepetitive HUR0417 sequence (642 bp).27 Samples with a band of the expected size were considered as female.
No nonspecific amplification was observed in any of the male or negative
control samples. Overall, out of 25 samples tested, 13 were identified
as females and 12 were identified as males.

Figure 2 Sex determination of
chick embryos using conventional PCR. A PCR
test, targeting a female-specific nonrepetitive HUR0417 sequence,
is used as a gold standard to determine the chick embryos’
sex. All of the amplified sequences were at the expected size (642
bp). Samples with a band at the expected size were considered as female.
No nonspecific amplification was observed in any of the control samples.
A total of 16 samples are presented (out of 25 samples that were tested).

Figure 3 presents
comparative results for sex determination of chick embryos using qPCR
and the MMB system. Using qPCR, to positively identify all female
samples, at least 13 cycles are required (Figure 3a). Using the MMB system, sex determination
with 100% specificity (all of the female samples are identified as
females) and 100% selectivity (no male samples are identified as females)
is achieved after only eight cycles (Figure 3b). These results are identical to the results
obtained using the adult birds’ DNA (Figure 1b), in which a minimum of 13 cycles were
required for qPCR to achieve 100% specific sex determination.

Figure 3 Sex determination
of chick embryos using qPCR and the MMB system.
A total of 12 male and 13 female samples were tested using (a) qPCR
and (b) the MMB system. Using qPCR, to positively identify all female
samples, at least 13 cycles are required. Using the MMB system, after
eight cycles, the receiver operating characteristic cutoff value allows
sex determination with 100% sensitivity (all of the female samples
are identified as females) and 100% specificity (all of the male samples
are identified as males).

Detection of repetitive DNA sequences is required in various
fields
of biological research, such as clinical diagnosis and agriculture.28,29 The natural “preamplification” of the target DNA sequence
facilitates detection of the target sequence at low concentrations,
either without or with a minimal number of PCR amplification cycles,
and it subsequently shortens the total duration of the assay. Quantitative
PCR combined with a TaqMan-based assay is relatively simple and does
not require additional analytical steps (e.g., gel electrophoresis).
To further improve the sensitivity of qPCR, double-quenched ZEN probes
were developed. These probes reduce the background noise caused by
the suboptimal quenching of the single quencher in a standard TaqMan
assay.

Here, to further reduce the detection time of repetitive
DNA sequences,
we introduced a modified double-quenched FRET-based assay that incorporates
two major modifications to the established TaqMan methodology. First,
similar to the double-quenched ZEN probe, the modified double-quenched
probe has two quenching molecules that reduce the background noise.
Second, the modified double-quenched probe has a biotin molecule on
the 5′ end, which allows it to be conjugated to streptavidin-coupled
magnetic beads and be detected by the MMB system. The MMB system significantly
improves the detection sensitivity and further reduces the number
of PCR amplification cycles required for reliable detection of the
repetitive DNA sequences. The lower number of amplification cycles
also reduces the possibility of nonspecific amplification and subsequently
the probability of false-positive results.

The MMB system, combined
with the modified double-quenched probe,
identified the chick sex in ovo with 100% sensitivity and specificity
after eight PCR amplification cycles. In comparison, the gold standard
qPCR discriminated female from male chicks after 13 PCR amplification
cycles. In practice, for qPCR, due to the requirement to complete
the entire testing program (∼30 cycles) prior to performing
the final analysis of the results, the testing time is 1–2
h. For example, in a recent study that used qPCR for chick sexing
and targeted the XhoI repetitive sequence, the total
assay time was ∼2 h.30

Amplification
of a long-target DNA sequence, such as the 717 bp XhoI sequence, is time-consuming. Amplification of a short
portion of the target is faster, but may compromise the specificity
of the assay. The intrinsic high specificity of FRET-based assays,
which include two primers and one probe (e.g., TaqMan or ZEN probes),
enable amplification and detection of shorter-target DNA sequences
(in the 120–140 bp range) without compromising specificity.
High processivity of the modern Taq polymerases (∼20
bases/s) facilitates the amplification of such short stretches of
DNA in a matter of seconds. Therefore, in the modified double-quenched
FRET-based assay, the length of a single PCR cycle was reduced to
25 s and the total PCR process was completed in less than 6 min. Consequently,
the total time of the assay was ∼13 min, which is 4–9
times shorter than other conventional PCR- or qPCR-based chick sexing
assays reported to date.

Similar to other PCR-based methods,
the proposed assay is sensitive
to the presence of PCR inhibitors in blood or tissue samples. Therefore,
the DNA samples were extracted and purified using the designated kits.
However, commonly used commercial DNA kits employ extraction protocols
that are lengthy, laborious, and require approximately 45 min. To
make the proposed assay applicable for commercial use, the DNA extraction
procedure must be simplified. Rapid DNA extraction methods31,32 can be adapted for use with avian blood samples and will reduce
the extraction time to 2 min, bringing the overall testing time from
blood collection to final sex determination to approximately 15 min.
The automation of the process can reduce the overall assay duration
even further.

The proposed assay can also be used to detect
nonrepetitive sequences.
However, without the natural preamplification of the repetitive sequences,
the number of cycles needed for detection of nonrepetitive sequences
may be higher. Nevertheless, the advantages of the MMB-based assay
relative to qPCR are expected to be maintained.

Conclusions
The
modified double-quenched FRET-based assay detects repetitive
target DNA sequences in less than 15 min, which is 4–9 times
faster than qPCR-based assays. The widespread presence of repetitive
DNA motifs in the genomes of almost all branches of life, sometimes
in exceptionally high numbers of copies, makes this method a valuable
tool for a variety of scientific and diagnostic tasks that require
rapid detection and high sensitivity. By specifically tailoring the
primers and probe, the proposed assay can be used to detect any target
DNA sequence, either repetitive or nonrepetitive.

Experimental
Section
Ethical Statement
All experiments involving collection
of biological material (blood samples) from adult birds and in ovo
embryos of domestic chicken (Gallus gallus) were performed according to the guidelines and protocols approved
by the Bar-Ilan University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Internal research number: 53-08-2015

Blood Sample Collection
from Adult Birds and in Ovo Embryos
Whole blood samples (1.5
mL) from 20 adult Gallus
gallus chickens (10 males and 10 females) were obtained
at a local breeding farm (Yoram Weissman, Sitria, Israel) using heparin-flushed
disposable syringes (Heparin Lock Flush Solution, Kamada, Beit Kama,
Israel). Immediately after collection, the whole blood samples were
aliquoted (0.5 mL/Eppendorf tube) and transferred on dry ice to Bar-Ilan
University. Upon arrival at the laboratory, one aliquot of each sample
was used for DNA extraction and the rest of the aliquoted samples
were frozen at −80 °C until further use.

A total
of 25 fertilized eggs, also obtained from the Weissman farm, were
incubated at 37 °C and 60% relative humidity for 16 days. On
day 17, the pointed pole of the egg’s shell was carefully removed
and 50 μL of blood was extracted from the embryo’s peripheral
blood vessels using a heparin-flushed insulin disposable syringe (Insumed
31G, Artsana S.p.a, Grandate, Italy).

DNA Extraction
For the initial testing of the assay,
genomic DNA was extracted from 0.5 mL of the adult chickens’
whole blood, using a QIAGEN QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit (QIAGEN, GmbH,
Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
For the in ovo assay validation, genomic DNA was extracted from 5
μL of whole blood that was collected from each fertilized egg.
The DNA extraction was performed using a QIAGEN QIAamp DNA Blood Mini
Kit (QIAGEN, GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Extracted DNA samples were aliquoted and stored at −80
°C until further use.

Bioinformatics Analysis
Bioinformatics
analysis was
performed using the NCBI BLAST+ web service and the most recent available
version of the domestic chicken genome (Gallus_gallus-5.0; GCA_000002315.3).33 To determine their relative abundance and chromosomal
affiliation, known female-specific repetitive sequences26 were verified against the genomic data. Highly
repetitive sequences located within the female-specific W chromosome
(XhoI and RhoI) were chosen as potential
targets. Specifically, the repetitive sequence XhoI (717 bp) was further analyzed and the inner portion (120 bp) of
the sequence was selected as a final target for the development of
the modified double-quenched FRET-based assay.

Oligonucleotides
All of the oligonucleotides (i.e.,
FRET-based probes and primers) in the current research were designed
using the PrimerQuest Tool web service from Integrated DNA Technologies,
Inc. (IDT, Skokie, IL) and purchased from the same vendor. Lyophilized
oligonucleotides of the standard and modified ZEN assay were reconstituted
in DNase-free ultrapure water (Biological Industries, Beit HaEmek,
Israel) to a final concentration of 100 μM. The resulting solutions
were aliquoted and frozen at −20 °C until further use.
The modified ZEN probe (23b long), targeting the selected portion
of the XhoI repetitive sequence, included a biotin
and a fluorophore (Alexa532, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA)
on the first nucleotide at the 5′ end, a dark quencher (ZEN
quencher) at the ninth nucleotide, and another dark quencher (Iowa
Black FQ) at the 3′ end. The synthetic oligonucleotides used
in this research are described in Table 1.

Adult Bird Sexing Using a Magnetically Modulated
FRET-Based
Assay
To estimate the number of PCR cycles required to positively
differentiate between male and female chicks using the MMB system,
we took genomic DNA samples from five adult male and five adult female
birds. For each DNA sample, four PCRs with a final volume of 25 μL/reaction
were prepared. Each reaction contained 1 μL of genomic DNA (50
ng/μL), 12.5 μL of JumpStart Taq ReadyMix
(Sigma-Aldrich, MO), 0.5 μL (500 pmol) of forward and 0.5 μL
(500 pmol) of reverse primers, 10 μL (10 pmol) of a modified
double-quenched probe, and 0.5 μL of DNase/RNase-free ultrapure
water.

Using the Mastercycler Nexus Thermal Cycler (Eppendorf,
Hamburg, Germany), the four PCR mixtures were subjected to 2 min at
94 °C, followed by 5, 10, 20, or 30 PCR cycles of 30 s at 94
°C, 30 s at 54 °C, and 30 s at 68 °C. The total duration
of each cycle was 90 s. Subsequently, the reaction tubes were removed
from the thermocycler and their content was supplemented with 75 μL
of ultrapure water for a final volume of 100 μL and then analyzed
using the MMB system.

We prepared two groups of negative controls,
in which either the
genomic DNA (1 μL) or the JumpStart Taq ReadyMix
(12.5 μL) was replaced with ultrapure water (upH2O). Each group of negative controls consisted of four PCRs that were
subjected to the same number of incubation cycles as the experimental
reactions. Following incubation, the negative controls were analyzed
using the MMB system.

Adult Bird Sexing Using qPCR
To
estimate the number
of PCR cycles required to positively differentiate between male and
female chicks using qPCR, we used the same genomic DNA samples from
five adult male and five adult female birds. For each DNA sample,
a PCR with a final volume of 25 μL/reaction was prepared. Each
reaction contained 1 μL of genomic DNA (50 ng/μL), 12.5
μL of JumpStart Taq ReadyMix (Sigma-Aldrich,
MO), 0.5 μL (500 pmol) of forward and 0.5 μL (500 pmol)
of reverse primers, 10 μL (10 pmol) of a modified double-quenched
probe, and 0.5 μL of DNase/RNase-free ultrapure water. Using
the CFX96Touch Real-Time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA), the PCR mixtures were subjected to 2 min at 94 °C, followed
by 30 PCR cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 54 °C, and 30
s at 68 °C. The total duration of each cycle was 95 s, including
the 5 s imaging step. As a negative control, we prepared a PCR mixture
in which the genomic DNA (1 μL) was replaced with ultrapure
water (upH2O).

Chick Sexing of Embryos Using Conventional
PCR
To determine
the chick sex in ovo, we used conventional PCR, targeting the 642
bp female-specific nonrepetitive sequence (HUR0417).27 Genomic DNA samples extracted from 25 fertilized eggs were
used. For each DNA sample, we prepared a reaction mixture containing
1 μL of DNA (50 ng/μL), 12.5 μL of JumpStart Taq ReadyMix (Sigma-Aldrich, MO), 0.5 μL (500 pmol)
of forward and 0.5 μL (500 pmol) of reverse primers (see Table 1), and 10.5 μL
of DNase/RNase-free ultrapure water.

The 25 PCR mixtures were
subjected to 60 s at 94 °C, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at
94 °C, 30 s at 52 °C, and 30 s at 68 °C. The total
duration of each cycle was 90 s, and the total duration of the PCR
phase (including heating and cooling) was ∼50 min. Subsequently,
the reaction tubes were removed from the thermocycler and their content
was analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis. Agarose gel was prepared
by dissolving 1% (w/v) agarose (Benchmark Scientific, Sayreville,
NJ) in Tris–borate–ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid buffer
1× (Amresco, Solon, OH). Boiled agarose solution was cooled to
50 °C and then supplemented with SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
After solidification of the cast gel, 5 μL from each reaction
was mixed with 1 μL of gel loading dye (New England BioLabs,
Ipswich, MA) and loaded into the wells. Electrophoresis was performed
for 5 min at 60 V, followed by 40 min at 160 V, using a Wide Mini-Sub
Horizontal Electrophoresis System and PowerPac HC High-Current Power
Supply (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Following the electrophoresis step,
the gel was transferred to the ChemiDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA) and analyzed.

Comparing Chick Sexing in Ovo Using qPCR
and the Magnetically
Modulated FRET-Based Assay
Following successful determination
of chick sex in ovo using PCR, we evaluated the capabilities of our
modified FRET-based assay to determine the chick sex using qPCR and
the MMB system. Genomic DNA samples extracted from 25 fertilized eggs
were used. For each DNA sample, we prepared a reaction mixture containing
1 μL of DNA (50 ng/μL), 12.5 μL of JumpStart Taq ReadyMix (Sigma-Aldrich, MO), 0.5 μL (500 pmol)
of forward and 0.5 μL (500 pmol) of reverse primers, 10 μL
(10 pmol) of a modified double-quenched probe, and 0.5 μL of
DNase/RNase-free ultrapure water.

For the qPCR analysis, the
25 PCR mixtures were subjected to 1 min at 94 °C, followed by
30 cycles of 10 s at 94 °C, 10 s at 54 °C, and 5 s at 68
°C. The total duration of each cycle was 25 s, and the total
duration of the PCR phase (including heating, cooling, imaging, and
analysis) was approximately 25 min.

For the MMB analysis, the
25 PCR mixtures were subjected to 1 min
at 94 °C, followed by eight cycles of 10 s at 94 °C, 10
s at 54 °C, and 5 s at 68 °C. The total duration of each
cycle was 25 s, and the total duration of the PCR phase (including
heating and cooling) was approximately 6 min. Subsequently, the reaction
tubes were removed from the thermocycler; then, their contents were
supplemented with 75 μL of ultrapure water for a final volume
of 100 μL and analyzed using the MMB system.

MMB System
Testing
Prior to testing in the MMB system,
each PCR was incubated under constant rotation (TR-1550, MRC, Israel,
40 rpm) for 5 min at room temperature with ∼100 000
streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads (M-280 Streptavidin, Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA). Subsequently, the beads were collected and
resuspended in 400 μL of phosphate-buffered saline 1× buffer
(Biological Industries, Beit HaEmek, Israel) supplemented with 0.01%
(v/v) Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, MO). Then, a total of three borosilicate
cuvettes (W2540, VitroCom, Mountain Lakes, NJ), each loaded with 100 μL
of the final solution, were measured using the MMB system. To reduce
their autofluorescence, prior to their use in the assay, the magnetic
beads were photobleached for 18 h.34

MMB System Setup
The MMB system, shown in Figure 4, uses a 532 nm laser
diode module (ThorLabs, CPS532), working at 0.25 mW. The laser beam
is diverted by a dichroic mirror (Semrock, BrightLine Di02-R532) and
focused by an objective lens (Newport, M-10X, 0.25 NA) to a 150 μm
spot size on the borosilicate sample cell, which contains the magnetic
beads. The emitted fluorescence is collected using the same objective
lens, passed through the dichroic mirror and two emission filters
(Semrock, FF03-575/25), and detected by a digital camera (FLIR, GS3-U3-23S6M-C).
Two electromagnets, one on each side of the glass sample cell, apply
an alternating magnetic field gradient at 1 Hz, causing the magnetic
beads to aggregate and move in a periodic lateral motion inside the
sample cell. As the bead aggregate passes in front of the optical
laser beam, the fluorescence emitted from the assay complex creates
a flashing signal that is distinguishable from the constant background
of the sample matrix or from unbound fluorescent molecules. A sequence
of 600 images are acquired over a period of 12 s. The gray value from
the laser beam area of each image is integrated, and the peak-to-peak
voltage differences over time are calculated and averaged. The MMB
system is enclosed in a lightproof box, which allows for the detection
of low analyte concentrations and greatly reduces the measurement
fluctuations that would otherwise be introduced by intrusive exterior
light.

Figure 4 Magnetic modulation biosensing system setup. The 532 nm laser beam
is reflected by a dichroic mirror and focused by an objective lens
onto a borosilicate cuvette, which contains the sample of magnetic
beads. The cuvette is positioned between two electromagnets that cause
the beads to aggregate and move in a periodic motion, in and out of
the laser beam. The laser excites the fluorophores in the sample,
and the modulated emitted fluorescence is collected by the same objective
lens, filtered by two emission filters, and detected by a camera.
