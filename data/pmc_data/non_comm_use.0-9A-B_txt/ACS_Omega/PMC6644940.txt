We
show that bilayer α-phase In2Se3 and monolayer
MoSe2 form a type-I band alignment, with
both the conduction band minimum and the valence band maximum located
in MoSe2. Samples were fabricated by a two-step chemical
vapor deposition method. The photoluminescence yield of the heterostructure
sample was found to be similar to monolayer MoSe2, indicating
the lack of an efficient charge transfer from MoSe2 to
In2Se3. This is further confirmed by the observation
that the photocarrier lifetime in the heterostructure is similar to
monolayer MoSe2, showing the lack of layer separation of
the electrons and holes. Efficient energy transfer from In2Se3 to MoSe2 was observed by the sevenfold
enhancement of the differential reflection signal in the heterostructure
and its ultrashort rising time. Furthermore, we observed significant
photoluminescence quenching in heterostructures formed by bulk In2Se3 and monolayer MoSe2, which suggests
efficient charge transfer and therefore type-II band alignment. These
findings suggest that α-In2Se3 ultrathin
layers can be effectively integrated as light-absorbing layers with
other transition metal dichalcogenides for novel optoelectronic applications.

1 Introduction
Since 2010, significant efforts have been devoted to the studies
of two-dimensional (2D) materials beyond graphene,1−3 such as transition
metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and phosphorene. These new materials
possess several attractive features, including their layer-dependent
electronic structures4,5 and crystal symmetry,6,7 the enhanced Coulomb interaction because of reduced dielectric screening,8,9 large optical absorption coefficients because of the van Hove singularity,10,11 and being flexible.12 On the basis of
these novel properties, 2D materials have been considered good candidates
for applications such as field-effect transistors,13,14 integrated circuits,15 solar cells,16 photodetectors,16 and light-emitting diodes.17−19

Recently, a relatively
less explored 2D material, α-phase
In2Se3, has emerged as a promising material
for novel optoelectronic applications. Unlike most TMDs that undergo
an indirect-to-direct band gap transition from bulk to monolayer (1L),
reports have shown that α-In2–Se3 may possess direct band gaps in all thicknesses.20 This could facilitate efficient light absorption and emission,
which are beneficial for many optoelectronic applications. Furthermore,
its band gap changes from about 1.45 eV in bulk form to about 2.8
eV in few layers.20 Such a range is among
the largest in 2D materials and allows tuning of the operation wavelength
of optoelectronic devices by thickness. Recently, several groups have
reported high-gain and high-detectivity photodetectors of multilayer
α-In2–Se3 that perform better than
most-known 2D materials.21−23 Demonstration of growth of high-quality
monolayers by physical vapor deposition23 also indicates potentials of large-scale production.

One advantage
of the 2D materials for optoelectronic applications
is that they allow fabrication of multilayer heterostructures with
tailored properties.24 These multilayers
are bound by van der Waals interlayer coupling, which does not have
individual atomic correspondence. Hence, the lattice-matching requirement,
which has been a major constraint when fabricating heterostructures
with ionic or covalence materials, is largely relaxed. This new approach
can thus produce a vast number of new materials and can potentially
transform material discovery.25,26 For example, heterostructures
combining graphene and TMDs can improve the performance of photodetectors27−29 and photovoltaic devices.10,27 Combing different TMD
monolayers can provide tuning of the optical and transport properties
of these materials30−33 and control of photocarrier dynamics.34−39

In this context, it is interesting to explore integration
of In2Se3 with other 2D materials, such as TMDs.
The
effort will also expand the horizon of van der Waals heterostructures
by introducing new materials with different lattice structures. Here,
we report a study on two key issues for developing such heterostructures,
the nature of the band alignment, and the interlayer energy and charge
transfer. Understanding the band alignment is the first step to developing
strategies to tailor the electronic and optical properties of these
materials, whereas efficient energy or charge transfer is highly desired
for harnessing emergent properties of 2D heterostructures.

2 Results and Discussion
Presently, the nature of the
band alignment between 2L In2Se3 and 1L MoSe2 is still unclear. Kelvin probe
force microscope measurements have shown that the difference of the
Fermi levels between 2L In2Se3 and 1L MoSe2 is only about 200 meV.40 Because
each Fermi level is near the bottom of the conduction band41 and the band gap of 2L In2Se3 is about 2.8 eV,20 much larger
than the optical band gap of 1L MoSe2 of 1.55 eV, it is
safe to assume that the valence band maximum (VBM) of MoSe2 is higher than In2Se3 by a large amount. However,
the sign of the conduction band offset is unknown. If the conduction
band minimum (CBM) of 1L MoSe2 is lower than 2L In2Se3, as shown in Figure 1a, the heterostructure would be of type-I
nature. In this case, one would expect energy transfer from In2Se3 to MoSe2, (indicated by the arrow)
via either Dexter or Förster mechanisms. Neither charge transfer
nor energy transfer would occur from MoSe2 to In2Se3. On the other hand, a type-II heterostructure could
form if the CBM of MoSe2 is higher than In2Se3, as shown in Figure 1b. Such a band alignment would facilitate charge transfer,
i.e., electron transfer from MoSe2 to In2Se3, as indicated by the dashed arrow, and hole transfer from
In2Se3 to MoSe2 (not shown).

Figure 1 Possible band
alignment of the 2L-In2Se3/1L-MoSe2 heterostructure showing type-I (a) and type-II (b) alignments
with energy and charge transfers in each case.

In the following discussions, we will show that the band
alignment
is type-I, and that the energy transfer from In2Se3 to MoSe2 is ultrafast and highly efficient.

Figure 2a shows
the atomic model of the In2Se3–MoSe2 heterostructures studied here, which were fabricated by chemical
vapor deposition (CVD)40 (see Experimental Section). Figure 2b shows the optical microscope image of the
1L MoSe2 and the heterostructure samples. Because the flakes
are on Si–SiO2 substrates, the interference of multiple
reflections results in different colors and contrasts of the two samples,
which allow us to safely identify the samples. The identification
procedure has also been confirmed by atomic force microscopy measurements.40

The samples were characterized by Raman spectroscopy with
a 532
nm laser. The black curve in Figure 2c shows the Raman spectrum obtained from a 1L-MoSe2 flake. Four peaks are clearly observed, which are assigned
to the E1g (about 145 cm–1), A1g (about 239 cm–1), E2g (about 286 cm–1), and defect modes (about 252 cm–1), respectively, according to previous reports.42,43 The Raman spectrum measured from a heterostructure formed by bulk
In2Se3 and 1L MoSe2 is shown as the
blue curve in Figure 2c. We observed three peaks at about 110, 174, and 207 cm–1. These peaks are reasonably consistent with the previous reports
of Raman spectra of α-In2Se323,44 and can be assigned to A1(LO + TO), A1(TO),
and A1(LO) modes, respectively. Raman peaks from the underneath
1L MoSe2 are reduced but still visible, with no apparent
shifts. The red curve in Figure 2c shows the Raman spectrum from the heterostructure
formed by 2L In2Se3 and 1L MoSe2.
The In2Se3 peaks are greatly reduced because
of the smaller thickness, whereas the peaks from MoSe2 are
similar to the 1L-MoSe2 sample. It has been well-established
that the width of these phonon modes in TMDs is sensitive to charge
density and broadens noticeably when the charge density is changed
because of doping or interlayer charge transfer.45,46 The lack of broadening of these modes appears to suggest that the
charge transfer in these heterostructures is insignificant. Furthermore,
because the lattice strain often results in a redshift of these phonon
modes,46−48 the absence of such shifts further confirms the strain-free
growth of the heterostructures.

We next probe the potential
charge- and energy-transfer processes
in the heterostructures by comparing their photoluminescence (PL)
with 1L MoSe2. The black curve in Figure 2d shows the PL spectrum of 1L MoSe2 under the excitation of a 532 nm continuous-wave laser. The spectrum
and the PL yield are consistent with previous results.42,43 With the same experimental conditions, the PL peak from the 2L-In2Se3/1L-MoSe2 heterostructure (red curve)
is similar to 1L MoSe2. The small decrease of the intensity
can be attributed to the additional loss when the excitation laser
beam and the PL goes through the In2Se3 layer.
The slight shift (from 819 to 821 nm) could be attributed to the effect
of different dielectric environments on the optical band gap of 1L
MoSe2. On the contrary, the heterostructure formed by bulk
In2Se2 and 1L MoSe2 shows no detectable
PL under the same experimental conditions, as shown by the blue curve
in Figure 2d.

The lack of PL quenching in the 2L-In2Se3/1L-MoSe2 heterostructure suggests that the interlayer
charge transfer is insignificant, which suggests that 2L In2Se3 and 1L MoSe2 do not form a type-II band
alignment. In type-II heterostructures formed by 2D materials, PL
quenching induced by an efficient charge transfer has been generally
observed.31,36,38,49−53 The separation of the electrons and holes to the two layers suppresses
their radiative recombination in either layers. In the PL measurement
of 2L-In2Se3/1L-MoSe2 heterostructure,
the 532 nm laser only injects electrons and holes in MoSe2 because its photon energy is smaller than the optical band gap of
2L In2Se3. If the band alignment was type-II,
electrons would transfer to In2Se3, as illustrated
in Figure 1b, instead
of radiatively recombining with the holes in MoSe2. This
process would induce significant quenching of MoSe2 PL
in comparison with 1L MoSe2 samples.

One alternative
explanation of the lack of charge transfer is the
poor interface quality of the heterostructure samples. In manually
stacked heterostructures, interface contamination could be introduced
during the fabrication process, which can prevent the interlayer charge
transfer. However, the In2Se3 layer was directly
grown on MoSe2 by CVD. Hence, the interface is expected
to be free of contamination. Indeed, the significant PL quenching
in nL-In2Se3/1L-MoSe2 heterostructure confirms the high quality of the interface between
MoSe2 and In2Se3. Because nL In2Se3 has a much smaller band
gap than 2L In2Se3, it is very likely that it
forms type-II alignment with 1L MoSe2. Because the interface
quality between nL In2Se3 and
1L MoSe2 is high enough to allow such efficient charge
transfer, the interface of the 2L-In2Se3/1L-MoSe2 samples obtained during the same fabrication procedure should
have comparable quality. Hence, the lack of charge transfer is most
likely because of a type-I band alignment, as illustrated in Figure 1a.

Study of
photocarrier dynamics in 2L-In2Se3/1L-MoSe2 heterostructures can provide further evidence
on its type-I band alignment and information on the interlayer energy
transfer from In2Se3 to MoSe2, as
illustrated in Figure 1a. We performed transient absorption measurements in reflection geometry
with the setup shown in Figure 4. We started with the 1L MoSe2 sample. A tightly
focused pump pulse of 410 nm injects photocarriers. The differential
reflection (dR/R0) of
an 820 nm probe pulse was detected as a function of the probe delay
(defined as the arrival time of the probe pulse at the sample with
respect to the pump pulse). The probe wavelength is near the PL peak
of the sample for efficient detection of the photocarriers.54 The results are shown in Figure 3a. The decay of the signal can be fit by
a biexponential function, as shown by the red curves in Figure 3a. The two time constants are
summarized in the inset of Figure 3b. The fast process of 0.9 ps has a weight of about
70%. This process has been previously observed in TMDs and has been
attributed to the exciton formation process.55−57 The slow process
of 24 ps can be attributed to the exciton recombination in 1L MoSe2. Figure 3b
shows the peak signal as a function of the pump fluence. The linear
dependence confirms that the signal is proportional to the photocarrier
density.

Figure 3 (a) Differential reflection signals measured with 410 nm pump and
820 probe pulses from a 1L MoSe2 flake. Black, blue, and
green curves are signals with pump fluences of 24.9, 33.2, and 41.5
μJ cm–2, respectively. Red curves are biexponential
decay fits. (b) Peak differential reflection signal from 1L MoSe2 as a function of the pump fluence. The inset shows the two
decay constants as a function of the pump fluence. The red line is
a linear fit. (c) Same as (a) but from the 2L-In2Se3/1L-MoSe2 heterostructure. The inset shows the
same signals but in a smaller range of the probe delay. (d) Peak differential
reflection signal from the 2L-In2Se3/1L-MoSe2 heterostructure. The red line is the fit (see text). The
two decay constants are summarized in the inset.

These measurements were repeated with the 2L-In2Se3/1L-MoSe2 heterostructure under the same
experimental
conditions. The results are shown in Figure 3c. Similarly, the decay is fit by biexponential
functions (red curves), with two time constants shown in the inset
of Figure 3d. The fast
and slow processes have weights of about 60 and 40%, respectively.
Compared with the 1L MoSe2, the magnitude of the signal
is about 7 times higher. Because the probe mainly monitors the photocarriers
in MoSe2, the enhancement of the signal can only come from
the photocarriers that were injected in In2Se3 and subsequently transferred to MoSe2. If the band alignment
was type-II, as shown in Figure 1b, only holes would transfer. These transferred holes
would have a very long lifetime in MoSe2 because their
recombination with electrons (that are in the In2Se3 layer) was greatly suppressed by their spatial separation.
However, we observed a similar (slightly shorter) decay time of the
signal in the heterostructure. This shows that the holes transferred
have a short lifetime that is comparable to the photocarriers injected
in 1L MoSe2. Hence, we can conclude that electrons injected
in In2Se3 also transfer to MoSe2,
and that the band alignment is type-I.

Because both electrons
and holes injected in In2Se3 transfer to MoSe2, there is no net charge transfer.
The overall process is an energy-transfer process. A closer look at
the rising part of the signal, as shown in the inset of Figure 3c, indicates that the signal
reaches a peak on a time scale that is close to the instrument response
time. Hence, the transfer of energy from 2L In2Se3 occurs on an ultrafast time scale of a fraction of 1 ps at most.
The energy transfer can be achieve by two mechanisms: Fröster-type
and Dexter-type energy transfers. The former occurs via nonradiative
dipole–dipole coupling of the two layers: an electron–hole
pair (or exciton) in the first layer recombines nonradiatively, transferring
the energy for the excitation of an electron–hole pair (or
exciton) in the second layer.58 The latter
involves sequential or simultaneous transfer of both electrons and
holes.59,60 From the experiments, we are unable to reveal
which mechanism is responsible for the observed transfer because both
mechanisms have the same final result.

Finally, the slightly
shorter lifetime of excitons in the heterostructure
can be attributed to additional contributions from exciton–exciton
annihilation. Under the same excitation pump fluence, the signal from
the heterostructures is about 7 times larger than that of 1L MoSe2. This suggests that the exciton density in the MoSe2 layer of the heterostructure sample is 7 times higher than that
of the 1L MoSe2 sample. It has been generally observed
in TMDs that at high densities, exciton–exciton can induce
shorter carrier lifetimes.61−64 Indeed, we observe a saturation effect in the heterostructures,
where the peak signal shows a sublinear dependence on the pump fluence,
as shown in Figure 3d. The data can be fit by a saturation model, ΔR/R0 ∝ F/(F + Fs), as shown by the red
curve, with the saturation fluence of Fs = 11.4 μJ cm2.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we found that CVD-grown heterostructures of 2L-α-In2Se3/1L-MoSe2 have a type-I band alignment,
with both the CBM and the VBM located in MoSe2. This conclusion
is supported by several experimental findings, such as the lack of
PL quenching and similar exciton lifetimes in the heterostructure.
The energy transfer from In2Se3 to MoSe2 was found to be highly efficient, from the enhanced differential
reflection signal from the heterostructure with an ultrashort rising
time. We also found that bulklike In2Se3 forms
type-II band alignment with 1L MoSe2, with an efficient
interlayer charge transfer. These findings suggest that α-In2Se3 ultrathin layers can be effectively integrated
with other TMD 1Ls for novel optoelectronic applications, with the
capability of band alignment control by thickness.

4 Experimental Section
The samples were fabricated by a two-step
CVD technique.40 First, 1L MoSe2 was synthesized on
a SiO2/Si substrate. As precursors, elemental Se and MoO3 powders were put in zone 1 and zone 2 of a two-zone furnace.
The substrate was located near MoO3. Zone 1 and zone 2
were heated to 100 and 780 °C, respectively, in 15 min. Then,
zone 1 was heated further to 270 °C in 5 min and kept for 30
min, with zone 2 kept at 780 °C. The reaction was under 40 sccm
Ar and 10 sccm H2 atmosphere. In the second step, In2Se3 was grown on the substrate with 1L MoSe2. Se and In2O3 powders were used as
precursors. Other conditions were kept the same as for MoSe2, except that the temperature of zone 2 was reduced to 660 °C
and was kept for 25 min. Figure 2e shows an atomic force microscopic image of the 1L
MoSe2 and 2L In2Se3 on 1L MoSe2 sample. The thickness of the monolayer MoSe2 is
about 1 nm, and the thickness of In2Se3 layers
on 1L MoSe2 sample is about 1.9 nm. Hence, the heterostructure
samples are fabricated with bilayer, that is, In2Se3 on the top of monolayer MoSe2.

Time-resolved
differential reflection measurements were performed
with a setup that is schematically shown in Figure 4. A Ti/sapphire laser generates 100 fs pulses with a repetition
rate of 80 MHz. The central wavelength of the pulse is 820 nm with
a full width at half maximum (fwhm) of about 10 nm. The 820 nm beam
is split to 2 parts with a beamsplitter. One part serves as the probe
pulse, whereas the other is focused to a beta barium borate crystal
to generate its second harmonic at 410 nm, serving as the pump. The
two beams are combined with a beamsplitter and focused on to the sample
through the objective lens of a microscope. The sizes of the pump
and probe spots are 1.5 and 2.5 μm in fwhm, respectively. The
reflected probe is collected by the same lens and is sent to a silicon
photodiode. A set of filters is put in front of the photodiode to
block the reflected pump beam. The output of a photodiode is measured
by a lock-in amplifier. A mechanical chopper is placed in the pump
beam to modulate its intensity at about 2 kHz. All of the measurements
were taken at room temperature with samples exposed in air. With this
configuration, the lock-in amplifier measures the differential reflection,
ΔR/R0 = (R – R0)/R0, where R and R0 are the reflection coefficient of the probe with and without
the presence of the pump beam, respectively.54
