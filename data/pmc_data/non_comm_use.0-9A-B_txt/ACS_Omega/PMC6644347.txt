Because of its electrically
conducting properties combined with
excellent thermal stability and transparency throughout the visible
spectrum, tin oxide (SnO2) is extremely attractive as a
transparent conducting material for applications in low-emission window
coatings and solar cells, as well as in lithium-ion batteries and
gas sensors. It is also an important catalyst and catalyst support
for oxidation reactions. Here, we describe a novel nonaqueous sol–gel
synthesis approach to produce tin oxide nanoparticles (NPs) with a
low NP size dispersion. The success of this method lies in the nonhydrolytic
pathway that involves the reaction between tin chloride and an oxygen
donor, 1-hexanol, without the need for a surfactant or subsequent
thermal treatment. This one-pot procedure is carried out at relatively
low temperatures in the 160–260 °C range, compatible with
coating processes on flexible plastic supports. The NP size distribution,
shape, and dislocation density were studied by powder X-ray powder
diffraction analyzed using the method of whole powder pattern modeling,
as well as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The SnO2 NPs were determined to have particle sizes between 3.4 and
7.7 nm. The reaction products were characterized using liquid-state 13C and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) that
confirmed the formation of dihexyl ether and 1-chlorohexane. The NPs
were studied by a combination of 13C, 1H, and 119Sn solid-state NMR as well as Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy. The 13C SSNMR, FTIR, and
Raman data showed the presence of organic species derived from the
1-hexanol reactant remaining within the samples. The optical absorption,
studied using UV–visible spectroscopy, indicated that the band
gap (Eg) shifted systematically to lower
energy with decreasing NP sizes. This unusual result could be due
to mechanical strains present within the smallest NPs perhaps associated
with the organic ligands decorating the NP surface. As the size increased,
we observed a correlation with an increased density of screw dislocations
present within the NPs that could indicate relaxation of the stress.
We suggest that this could provide a useful method for band gap control
within SnO2 NPs in the absence of chemical dopants.

1 Introduction
As
one of the most important members of the transparent conducting
oxide (TCO) class of materials, the electronic and optical properties
of pure and doped SnO2 have been investigated extensively.1,2 Tin oxide (SnO2) nanoparticles (NPs) are being developed
for applications ranging from their incorporation as an opacifier
in ceramic glazes to advanced technologies including gas sensors,
lithium-ion batteries, low emission window coatings, touch screens,
sensitized solar cells, field emission flat displays, and other optoelectronic
devices.3 For each of these applications,
it is important to have a simple, low cost and scalable synthesis
approach that will produce NPs within a narrow distribution of particle
sizes.2 Various synthesis strategies have
been developed to produce SnO2 NPs with different size
ranges and distributions.4−11 These processes usually require use of high temperatures, high boiling
point or mixed solvents, and expensive organic tin precursors that
are often toxic and require a complicated synthesis procedure. The
experimental parameters required for such reactions run counter to
the ability to produce highly crystalline nanosized structures with
controllable properties. To avoid the problems associated with several
of the proposed routes, synthetic routes that avoid the use of water
and toxic solvents or surfactants and/or toxic solvents have been
investigated.12,13 It is now important to develop
one-pot synthesis methods that can produce crystalline SnO2 NPs with tuneable particle sizes and band gap properties. Nonaqueous
sol–gel processing is a flexible and powerful approach to obtain
functionally active NPs.14−18 Here, we present a facile, one-pot, nonhydrolytic synthesis of SnO2 NPs with controllable average size and with a narrow size
distribution at low temperature.

Bulk crystalline SnO2 with a tetragonal rutile structure
(cassiterite phase) is an n-type direct gap semiconductor with the
band gap (Eg) equal to 3.6 eV (344 nm).
It provides an archetypal TCO, having up to 97% transparency across
the visible spectrum.19 This large value
is comparable with that required for complete transparency throughout
the visible range (i.e., Eg > 3.1 eV).
A large amount of research has been devoted to modifying the SnO2 conduction band minimum and consequently modifying its optical
absorption properties. These can be tuned by substituting elements
such as such as F, Sb, or Pb on the anion or cation sites, by controlling
NP size and morphology,1,2 or by causing internal strain
within materials prepared as thin-film samples.20 Nearly all of the studies to date have reported that Eg typically increases for smaller NP sizes.21−26

The nonaqueous sol–gel process is based on the reaction
between tin(IV) tetrachloride Sn(Cl)4 and 1-hexanol, leading
to the formation of SnO2 NPs with a narrow dispersion and
average sizes between 3.4 and 7.7 nm by varying the synthesis temperature
between 160 and 260 °C. Both reagents are readily available,
and the potentially scalable process yields NP materials that can
be used without further processing. Unusually, we observed that Eg for our materials increased as the NPs became
larger, with values determined to lie between 2.22 (indirect) and
3.12 (direct) eV for 3.4 nm NP sizes, to 3.53–3.99 eV for 7.7
nm particles. In order to investigate the origin of these unusual
electronic structure changes, we carried out detailed structural and
spectroscopic investigations of our SnO2 NPs using a combination
of X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM), UV–visible, IR and Raman, and 119Sn, 13C, and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy techniques. Analysis of the XRPD data using the
whole powder pattern modeling (WPPM) technique27−33 revealed the presence of axial strains and screw dislocations within
the NPs. These strains are correlated with the presence of organic
ligands detected by NMR, IR, and Raman spectroscopy and likely determine
the unexpected band gap behavior, as well as providing possibilities
for further modification and functionalization of the NP surfaces.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 X-ray Diffraction and HRTEM
The SnO2 NPs crystallized with the rutile structure
(space group P42/mnm),
with no additional
impurity phases detected by X-ray examination (Figure 1). Initial examination of the XRPD patterns
indicates that the peaks became sharper and better resolved with increasing
NP size at higher synthesis temperature. We then applied WPPM analysis
to the observed XRPD profiles.27,34 This approach provides
information on the average crystalline domain size of the SnO2 NPs and edge and screw dislocation densities (Table 1 and Figure 2); it has also been applied recently to solve
both size and defect concentration in the SnO2 system.33,35,36 The almost flat nature of the
residual line, displayed in Figure 2, indicates an excellent agreement between the experimental
data and the model; this also suggests that the assumption of spherical
shape for the investigated SnO2 nanodomains is likely appropriate.
The log-normal size distributions of the SnO2 NPs synthesized
at different temperatures shown in Figure 3 agree generally with the particle size distributions
obtained from the HRTEM images described below. However, we note that
the X-ray diffraction data and modeling provide more statistically
representative sampling for the overall specimens than analysis of
the TEM images. The unit cell volumes did not vary significantly as
a function of synthesis temperature, but small changes in the tetragonal
distortion of the SnO2 unit cell were observed, primarily
that the c/a ratio increased slightly
with the increasing synthesis temperature (Table 1). The average crystalline domain diameter
of SnO2 at 160 °C found by WPPM analysis was 3.4 nm
with a tail in the log-normal size distribution function extending
to ∼10 nm (Table 1, Figure 3). Increasing
the synthesis temperature led to a gradual increase in the average
crystalline domain diameter—this became 6.9 nm at 220 °C
and 7.7 nm by 260 °C. As shown in Table 1 and Figure 3, all the probability distributions have a positive
skewness, with some dispersion around the tails to larger NP sizes.
The number of screw dislocations “ρe”
was determined to be greater than that of edge dislocations in all
of the samples investigated (Table 1). The number of the edge dislocations did not change,
whereas the density of screw dislocations “ρs” increased slightly as a function of the synthesis temperature.33 The population of screw dislocations also exhibited
a wider distribution about the mean for syntheses carried out at 180
°C (Figure 4).

The effects of synthesis temperature on the size,
morphology, and
development of defects within the SnO2 NPs were further
investigated using HRTEM (Figure 5 and Table 2). All of the NPs exhibited a high degree of crystallinity,
with lattice fringes matching the cell parameters of rutile-structured
SnO2 (Figure 6). Our HRTEM images provided direct evidence for the existence of
screw as well as edge dislocations within the SnO2 NP samples
deduced from the WPPM XRPD analysis (Figure 6). The SnO2 crystallite sizes
estimated from the recorded images ranged between 2 and 11 nm, generally
consistent with our WPPM analysis of the XRPD data, although that
analysis provides a more complete average over the entire sample.

2.2 Liquid Phase NMR Spectroscopy
In
order to study the reaction of 1-hexanol with SnCl4 during
the synthesis, the supernatant liquid was filtered to remove the SnO2 solid precipitate, and analyzed using liquid 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The 13C NMR spectrum
is shown in Figure 7 (the 1H NMR spectrum is included in the Supporting Information file, Figure S1). From the analysis
of this spectrum, the presence of 1-hexanol (with the C1 carbon at
62.8 ppm), dihexyl ether (with the C1 carbon at 71.1 ppm), and 1-chlorohexane
(with the C1 carbon at 45.1 ppm) was determined (Table S1). All other peaks from these three hydrocarbons corresponding
to hexane carbons C2–C6 appear in the same region at 14–33
ppm. The formation of the dihexyl ether component was deduced from
the analysis of the solid-state 13C MAS NMR spectra, described
in the following section.

Figure 7 13C NMR spectrum of the reaction
solution after removal
of the NPs.

2.3 Solid-State
NMR of SnO2 NPs
The 13C MAS NMR spectra
of our samples are consistent
with the production of 1-hexanol (C6H13OH),
and also dihexyl ether (C6H13–O–C6H13) species during the SnO2 NP synthesis
reaction, that remain associated with the solid SnO2 NP
samples to the highest temperatures studied here. The spectrum of
the sample prepared at 160 °C (Figure 8a) shows a broad signal at 64.9 ppm that
can be assigned to the C1 atom of 1-hexanol. This is typically expected
to occur at ∼62 ppm, and the ∼3 ppm increase in chemical
shift can be attributed to strong H-bonding interactions with the
SnO2 NP surface. The 6 narrow signals observed at 72.5,
32.3, 30.1, 26.2, 23.1, and 13.3 ppm, along with analogous signals
at 71.4, 32.5, 30.4, 26.6, 23.3, and 14.3 ppm for the 200 °C
sample, can be attributed to the 6 inequivalent carbon environments
(C1–C6) of the hexyl (C6H13−)
fragments (Figure 8b). The observed shift at ∼72 ppm can suggest dihexyl ether
formation due to the change from −CH2–O–H
to −CH2–O–CH2C5H11 environments. An additional β-effect of about
+10 ppm of the CH2C5H11 substituent
(by analogy with the β-effect of the methyl group)37−40 acting on the chemical shift of the C1 carbon would be consistent
with this assignment. The reported 13C shifts for dihexyl
ether in CDCl3 solution at 71.05, 31.85, 29.90, 26.01,
22.71, and 14.02 ppm37,38 agree with those observed here
for samples prepared at 160 and 200 °C. Such high frequency shifts
are well known from previous 13C NMR studies. The signals
from C2–C6 atoms of dihexyl ether and 1-hexanol are expected
to overlap.37−40 From Figure 8, increasing
the synthesis temperature (Tsyn) from
160 to 200 °C leads to significant decrease of the signal intensity
at ∼65 ppm, reflecting a decrease in the amount of adsorbed
1-hexanol at higher temperature. From the integral intensities of
signals at 72 and 65 ppm, the mole-to-mole ratio of dihexyl ether
to 1-hexanol changes from 0.6 at 160 °C to 2.7 at 200 °C.
Note that unlike the liquid-state 13C NMR spectrum (Figure 7), no signal was
observed at ∼45 ppm, indicating the absence of 1-chlorohexane
in the 13C MAS SSNMR spectra of the SnO2 NP
samples analyzed (Figure 8).

Figure 8 Proton-decoupled 13C MAS (8 kHz) SSNMR spectra of samples
prepared at (a) 160 and (b) 200 °C; (c) 1H MAS (12
kHz) NMR spectrum of the sample prepared at 200 °C.

The 1H MAS spectrum of the sample prepared
at 200 °C
shows three well-resolved peaks at 3.4, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm (Figure 8c). The signals at
3.4 and 0.9 ppm are assigned to methylene and methyl protons of dihexyl
ether. Signals from the remaining methylene protons of dihexyl ether
(in positions 2, 3, 4, and 5) overlap, giving rise to the signal with
highest intensity at 1.4 ppm. A very broad peak at ∼6 ppm can
also be observed, that we assign to hydroxyl protons of water and
1-hexanol. The 1H MAS spectrum of the sample prepared at
160 °C was similar to that shown in Figure 8c, with slightly broader lines. The results
definitely indicated the presence of dihexyl ether in the sample prepared
at 260 °C. However, no 3.4 ppm signal was observed in the 1H MAS spectrum of one sample prepared at 180 °C, that
was subsequently annealed at 240 °C.

In order to gain insight
into the structural differences between
SnO2 NPs synthesized at different temperatures, 119Sn SSNMR measurements were undertaken using 300 MHz (Figure 9) and 600 MHz NMR instruments.
The half-height linewidths of the isotropic peaks in 119Sn MAS NMR spectra measured on a 600 MHz NMR instrument were as follows:
1.2 ± 0.1 kHz (Tsyn = 180 °C,
annealed at 240 °C for 72 h) and 8 ± 0.5 kHz (Tsyn = 200 °C). Previously, Tunstall et al. measured 119Sn NMR parameters of a series of SnO2 samples
with powder sizes varying between 4 and 32 nm in comparison with data
for standard bulk cassiterite SnO2 powder (∼10 μm)
using a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer.41 In
their case, the observed linewidths were between 0.6 and 1.7 kHz,
which is significantly less than that measured in this work for our
sample prepared at 200 °C.

Figure 9 119Sn MAS SSNMR spectra of
SnO2 samples prepared
at (a) 160 °C (MAS 5 kHz); (b) 180 °C (MAS 5 kHz); (c) 160
°C (MAS 12 kHz); (d) 180 °C (MAS 12 kHz); (e) 200 °C
(MAS 12 kHz); and (f) 260 °C (MAS 12 kHz). Unlike other samples,
the sample prepared at 180 °C was subsequently annealed at 240
°C for 72 h.

We attribute such unusually
large signal widths to the small average
particle sizes achieved in our studies (<8 nm, where the sample
properties are dominated by surface rather than bulk effects),41 combined with an increase in defect densities
noted for the NPs from WPPM and HRTEM analysis. The linewidths of
the isotropic peaks in 119Sn MAS NMR spectra measured on
a 300 MHz NMR instrument were as follows: 3.5 ± 0.2 kHz (Tsyn = 160 °C), 0.68 ± 0.05 kHz (Tsyn = 180 °C, then annealed at 240 °C
for 72 h), 4.4 ± 0.2 kHz (Tsyn =
200 °C), and 5.2 ± 0.5 kHz (Tsyn = 260 °C). In previous work, the 119Sn NMR linewidths
were found to increase with decreasing particle size. However, our
results suggest the opposite behavior. This could be partly due to
the increase in dislocation densities determined by WPPM analysis
of our XRPD data. The observation of broad lines and their field dependence
are also similar to those described by Alla and Lippmaa,42 which they attribute to the anisotropy of the
magnetic susceptibility, Δχυ. They showed
that adamantane mixed at a 1:10 ratio with p-dibromobenzene
shows severely broadened 13C lines due to the magnetic
field produced by crystallites of p-dibromobenzene
surrounding the adamantane particles. Similar arguments could apply
in the case of SnO2 NPs, where each 119Sn environment
experiences the magnetic field produced by large numbers of smaller
SnO2 NPs, leading to broadened lines. Only the sample prepared
at 180 °C and annealed at 240 °C shows narrow lines in the 119Sn NMR spectrum, and this is likely due to sintering of
the NPs causing agglomeration into larger crystallites.41 There is a noticeable line narrowing on proton
decoupling, giving rise to the following isotropic linewidths measured
on a 300 MHz NMR instrument: 3.2 ± 0.2 kHz (160 °C), 0.67
± 0.05 kHz (180 °C, annealed at 240 °C for 72 h), 4.1
± 0.2 kHz (200 °C), and 4.9 ± 0.5 kHz (260 °C).
This agrees with the 1H and 13C NMR results
that indicate that organic species and water are adsorbed on the surface
of the SnO2 NPs. The close proximity of protons to the
tin atoms of SnO2 leads to additional broadening due to 1H–119Sn dipolar interactions in 119Sn MAS spectra without proton decoupling.

We estimated the 119Sn chemical shift anisotropy (CSA,
Δδ) and the asymmetry parameter (η) for our samples.43 As a reference, we used values for crystalline
SnO2, although we note that there is some disagreement
in previously reported 119Sn CSA parameters for the cassiterite
phase. Clayden et al.44 reported Δδ/η
values of −125 ppm/0, while Cossement et al.43 found −125 ppm/0.27. From iterative Herzfeld–Berger
analysis of the spinning sideband intensities using the HBA program43,44 in the 119Sn NMR spectrum recorded at a magic-angle spinning
(MAS) frequency of 5 kHz at 7.05 T for the sample prepared at 180
°C, our best-fit Δδ/η values are −134
ppm/0.55, with δ11 = −535 ppm, δ22 = −584 ppm, δ33 = −693 ppm,
and δiso = −604 ppm. These are in agreement
with the best-fit Δδ/η values of −136 ppm/0.50
(δ11 = −536 ppm, δ22 = −581
ppm, δ33 = −695 ppm, and δiso = −604 ppm) determined from analysis of the 119Sn NMR spectrum recorded at a MAS frequency of 10 kHz at 14.1 T for
the same sample. Our best-fit CSA parameters determined from the analysis
of spinning sideband intensities at a MAS frequency of 5 kHz were
Δδ = −131 ppm and η = 0.37 (δ11 = −542 ppm, δ22 = −575 ppm, δ33 = −690 ppm, and δiso = −603
ppm) for the 160 °C sample and Δδ = −134 ppm
and η = 0.50 (δ11 = −535 ppm, δ22 = −580 ppm, δ33 = −691 ppm,
and δiso = −602 ppm) for that prepared at
200 °C. Because of the very large linewidths, these can be only
considered as approximate estimates, although they demonstrate an
increase in values compared to those for bulk cassiterite43,44 with an average particle size ≈ 10 μm.41 Such changes in the 119Sn CSA parameters are
commensurate with the increased number of Sn sites near the SnO2 NP surface compared to bulk atoms in nanometer-sized NPs.

2.4 IR and Raman Spectroscopy
Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the samples showed strong absorption
occurring between 400 and 750 cm–1 with two main
maxima observed near 650 and 545 cm–1 (Figure 10). These features
are typical of SnO2 NPs and are related to asymmetric and
symmetric Sn–O stretching vibrations of the bulk phase.45 The lower wavenumber component is slightly enhanced
for samples prepared at lower temperature that have a smaller NP size,
whereas an additional structure begins to be observed on the higher
frequency band of the 260 °C sample, approaching the IR spectra
of bulk SnO2 powders.46 The
strong asymmetric band with its maximum near 3450 cm–1 indicates the presence of adsorbed molecular H2O on the
surface of the NP samples. This also gives rise to the feature near
1630 cm–1 due to H–O–H bending. The
SnO2 NPs readily adsorb molecular H2O from the
atmosphere, as demonstrated by our thermogravimetric (TGA) analyses
of samples that had been exposed to air (Figure S2).

Figure 10 FTIR spectra of the samples containing SnO2 NPs produced
by the reaction between SnCl4 and 1-hexanol at different
temperatures.

The aliphatic C–H
stretching peaks between 2850 and 2950
cm–1 confirm our NMR results that organic species
derived from the 1-hexanol reactant remain present within the solid
samples. These features are particularly strong for the sample synthesized
at 160 °C, but they remain present to the highest synthesis temperatures
studied here, suggesting that the organic species remain strongly
bound to the external surfaces of the NPs. We do not yet have a good
interpretation for the broad absorption feature observed between approximately
1000 and 3000 cm–1, that has a maximum that moves
to different wavelengths as a function of synthesis temperature, although
it could be related to a light scattering effect associated with the
dielectric SnO2 NPs. Raman spectra were obtained for several
series of SnO2 NPs prepared in this study, using different
instruments and excitation wavelengths. Representative data obtained
with 514.5 nm laser excitation are shown in Figure 11. The spectra in the 400–700 cm–1 range are similar to observations by Diéguez
et al.,47 with broad bands dominated by
surface rather than bulk modes (Figure 11b). Bulk crystalline SnO2 with
a tetragonal rutile structure (P42/mnm space group) exhibits four Raman active peaks due to
zone center vibrations: A1g (634 cm–1), B2g (773 cm–1), Eg (473
cm–1), and a low frequency (123 cm–1) B1g mode that is not reported in all studies. For highly
crystalline materials including NPs with sizes above 75–100
nm, the spectra are dominated by the strong A1g mode that
becomes broadened and shift to a lower wavenumber as the particle
size decreases.48 The B2g and
Eg peaks become less visible, and broad features appear
between 450–600 and 750–800 cm–1,
corresponding to vibrational excitations in the density of states
function (g(ω)) that become activated as the particle size is
reduced. In addition, a weak peak due to a normally IR-active A2u LO mode can be observed as a surface mode in larger NPs,
while a further surface mode is reported to occur at 543 cm–1.48 As the NPs develop sizes below ∼15
nm, a broad feature near 572 cm–1 begins to dominate
the spectrum.47,49 This mode along with other weak
features has also been associated with surface vibrations. Our spectra
provide new information on features in the low wavenumber (200–400
cm–1) region, which correspond roughly with the
(g(ω)) profile for the bulk crystalline phase.50 Additional Raman features can also become activated because
of the presence of defects, including screw dislocations, as shown
by our X-ray WPPM analysis and HRTEM observations.51 Consistent with Diéguez et al,47 the A1g mode broadens and shifts to a lower
wavenumber as the NP size decreases, while the frequencies of B2g and Eg modes approach that of the A1g vibration. Our samples show broad bands in the 1350–1600
cm–1 range and near 3000 cm–1 because
of the presence of 1-hexanol and dihexyl ether attached to the NP
surface as detected by NMR spectroscopy.47

2.5 UV–Visible Optical Spectroscopy and
Band Gap Determination
UV–visible spectra were obtained
for the SnO2 NP samples using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
(DRS) (Figure 12).
The UV–vis data were transformed into an absorbance scale by
Kubelka–Munk analysis and optical Eg values determined using the Tauc method (Figure 13). The direct Eg for bulk SnO2 occurs at 3.60 eV.51,52 For SnO2 NPs, there is on-going discussion about the
direct versus indirect nature of the interband transition.53−56 For this reason, we examined both (αhν)2 and (αhν)1/2 versus
photon energy plots to determine Eg (Figure 13a,b). We note that
the direct gap model yields Eg values
that are systematically larger than with the indirect gap analysis,
and it leads to values that exceed that of bulk SnO2 for
our NPs prepared at the highest temperatures. However, if the transition
is indirect, it is found to approach the bulk value for the largest
samples (Table 3).
In both models, the Eg values increase
with NP size and synthesis temperature. This observation contrasts
with previous studies that have typically found an increase in the
band gap of undoped SnO2 NPs for smaller particle sizes.23,24,26,57 Here, we suggest an interpretation of our result based on the observed
changes in structural parameters with NP size and preparation temperature,
along with the presence of organic ligands derived from the synthesis
decorating the NP surface.

(b) Directly allowed Eg model—[F(R∞)hν]2, γ = 1/2; the red dashed lines are drawn
as a guide for the eye, showing an approximately exponential trend
for the evolution of the optical Eg with
the increase in the synthesis temperature.

Our analyses of the XRPD data show that the NPs all have the same
unit cell volume (0.072 nm3). This is approximately 6–7%
smaller than the bulk value (0.7687 nm3), indicating that
our SnO2 NPs are in a state of lattice compression compared
with the bulk material. There is also a slight change in the ao and co lattice
parameters, with the smallest NPs prepared at lowest Tsyn having the smallest c/a ratio (0.6703) rising to 0.6714 for the larger NPs (Table 1). Both values are larger than
the value for bulk SnO2 (0.6680), indicating a systematic
increase in the degree of axial strain. Both tensile and compressive
strains are known to modify Eg in SnO2 and other semiconductors, as well as the direct versus indirect
nature of the interband transition.20,58 We suggest
that these lattice strains could be linked to the presence of organic
ligands derived from the synthesis procedure decorating the growing
NP surfaces. The smallest NPs prepared at lowest temperature show
the smallest axial strain values and both their direct and indirect Eg values are smaller than the bulk material.
We can relate this effect to the overall state of compression of the
NPs, along with the c/a ratio that
is 0.3% greater than the bulk material. As the NPs grow in size with
higher synthesis temperature, we observe an increase in the c/a ratio along with an increased screw
dislocation density (Figure 4, Table 1).
The band gap shows a regular increase with the axial distortion, while
the NPs remain in a similar compressed state, to either approach or
exceed the bulk value depending on whether the transition is direct
or indirect (Figure 14). The increased concentration of screw dislocations determined by
WPPM modeling of the XRPD data testifies to the presence of mechanical
strains within the SnO2 NPs synthesized by our low temperature
nonaqueous sol–gel method (cf. Figure 14, top panel).

gap Eg (bottom

panel: indirect Eg vs domain diameter)
and the screw dislocation density with the average domain diameter
(top panel).

We also note that our
UV–visible spectra show significant
tailing effects at longer wavelengths, especially for the samples
prepared at lowest T. This effect could be partly
due to organic ligands attached to the NP surface inducing ligand-to-metal
charge transfer transitions59 (Figure 12). Similar effects
were noted by Wang et al. for carbon-coated SnO2 NPs,60 where the authors suggested that the outer carbonaceous
layer could photosensitize SnO2, extending the light absorption
into the visible range. The absorption tails could also be associated
with interband defect states associated with mechanical strains or
O2– vacancies within or at the surface of the NPs.
We modeled the Urbach energies (Eu) associated
with such possible defect states as ∼278 meV.51

3 Conclusions
We have
demonstrated a novel low-temperature (160–260 °C)
solvothermal route to achieve crystalline SnO2 NPs using
a one-pot nonhydrolytic sol–gel synthesis method. The use of
a readily available short chain alcohol (1-hexanol) as the reaction
medium and as one of the reagents provides a potentially scalable
process, leading to SnO2 NPs with very small and controllable
NP sizes within a narrow dispersion range. The reaction between SnCl4 and 1-hexanol avoids the use of expensive and toxic precursors
and thus offers an environmentally benign, inexpensive, and size-selected
process for production of SnO2 NPs with tunable optoelectronic
properties. The nonaqueous sol–gel method, together with the
WPPM analysis of XRPD data—combined with HRTEM imaging—allowed
us to engineer functionally active NPs, determine the NP sizes, and
identify screw dislocations present within the SnO2 NPs
in detail. This was further confirmed by HRTEM imaging.

We studied
changes in the optical band gap Eg by
analysis of UV–visible spectroscopic data. Our
results indicated that Eg was smaller
than that for bulk SnO2 for the smallest particles but
increased with NP size, contrary to previous findings. If we assumed
a direct gap model for interband transitions, our value estimated
for >3.5 nm particles exceeded that of the bulk solid, whereas
indirect
gap analysis showed values approaching the bulk for larger NPs prepared
at higher temperature. We suggest that the unexpected variation in Eg with a NP size is due to internal strain parameters
developed within the NPs that also lead to an increase in screw dislocation
densities observed at higher temperatures, as the particles become
larger. The internal strains may be associated with the presence of
organic ligands attached to the growing NP surfaces derived from the
synthesis reaction. Our simple, low-cost synthetic method leads to
new possibilities for tailoring the Eg of SnO2 nanomaterials as a function of NP size, surface
decoration, and the presence or relaxation of internal mechanical
strains. Such an approach can allow further tuning of the electronic
properties and visible light transparency of SnO2 NPs for
optoelectronic devices.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of SnO2 NPs
Tin(IV) chloride (99.995%)
and anhydrous 1-hexanol (99%) were used
as obtained from Aldrich. The syntheses were carried out in a glovebox
under controlled environmental conditions (O2 and H2O < 1 ppm). In a typical procedure, 1 mmol (0.2603 g) of
tin(IV) chloride was added to 20 mL of 1-hexanol, and the mixture
was transferred into a stainless-steel autoclave and sealed. The autoclave
was taken out of the glovebox and heated in a furnace at between 160
and 260 °C for 3 days. The resulting milky suspensions were centrifuged,
and the precipitates were washed with ethanol and dichloromethane
and dried in air at 60 °C.

4.2 Sample
Characterization
The SnO2 NPs were studied by
XRPD using a θ/θ diffractometer
(PANanalytical X’Pert Pro, NL) equipped with a fast RTMS detector,
using Cu Kα radiation (45 kV, 40 mA), in the 20–125°
2θ range, with a virtual step scan of 0.1° 2θ, and
a virtual time per step of 500 s. The diffraction profiles were analyzed
via the WPPM approach,27−33 using the PM2K software suite.34 This
powerful new technique allows extraction of microstructural information
from a powder diffraction pattern, by refining model parameters via
a nonlinear least squares fitting routine, fit to the experimental
data profile. Within the WPPM method, there is no need for modeling
the data using arbitrary peak shape functions (e.g., Gaussian, Lorentzian,
and Voigt), as the experimental scattering profile is fit as a convolution
of instrumental and sample-related physical effects. In this way,
the structural analysis is developed by taking into account physical
models of not only the lattice parameters but details of the microstructure
and lattice defects including planar and screw dislocations.27−34 The WPPM method provides an assessment of all aspects of the microstructure
including the crystallite domain shape, size, and distribution, with
effects due to dislocations modeled through the description of a dislocation
contrast factor in terms of a crystallographic invariant.29,32 It provides considerably more detailed information compared with
other integral methods for line profile analysis of XRPD data, such
as the routinely used Scherrer formula,61 or the Williamson–Hall approach.62 In these methods, instrumental profile components, background and
peak profile overlap can play an unwanted role in correctly extracting
integral breadths.61,62 Furthermore, additional sources
of line broadening and peak asymmetry, including domain size, lattice
strain, and the presence of lattice defects, cannot be investigated
in detail.63 Here, the instrumental contribution
to the XRPD profile was calibrated by modeling 14 hkl reflections from the NIST SRM 660b standard (LaB6), according
to the Caglioti et al. relationship.64 Then,
SnO2 described within space group P42/mnm for the tetragonal rutile structure
was introduced in the WPPM modeling of the data, and the following
parameters were refined: background (modeled using a 4th-order shifted
Chebyshev polynomial function), peak intensities, specimen displacement,
mean and variance of the NP size distributions, and lattice parameters.
For simplicity, the crystalline diffracting domains were assumed to
be spherical and that their diameter was distributed according to
a log-normal size distribution. Both edge and screw dislocations having
densities of ρe and ρs, respectively,
were initially assumed to be present in the 101̅ {101} slip
system, as was shown by Koffyberg [Burgers vector equal to (a02 + c02)1/2, with a0 and c0 being the lattice parameters],65 and validated recently by Scardi’s group
by means of the WPPM method.33,35 Our HRTEM images (see
below) showed that screw dislocations constituted the main defect
observed in the NPs, and hence, these were considered to be the only
source of anisotropy in the XRPD line profile broadening.

Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a Jeol-2000 FXII microscope,
with point-to-point and line-to-line resolutions of 0.28 and 0.14
nm, respectively. Additional high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were
obtained using a JEOL 2200FS microscope with a field-emission gun,
operated at 200 kV. Samples for TEM/HRTEM observations were prepared
by dispersing the NPs in ethanol and methanol, respectively, and evaporating
the suspension drops on carbon-coated Cu grids.

FTIR spectra
were obtained using a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer.
The IR measurements were carried out over the wavenumber range 4000–350
cm–1. Sample powders (2 mg) were mixed with KBr
(200 mg, to give ∼1 wt % of powder in the KBr disks) and pressed
into thin pellets. Raman spectra were measured using a Renishaw micro-Raman
instrument with excitation wavelengths of 325 and 514.5 nm. DRS was
used to evaluate the optical properties of SnO2 in the
UV–visible range. Spectra were acquired using a Shimadzu UV
3100 (JP) spectrometer equipped with a BaSO4 integrating
sphere in the 825–250 nm range, with 0.2 nm in step size, and
using BaSO4 as white reference material. The diffuse reflectance
data (R∞) were converted into an
absorption coefficient α using the Kubelka–Munk transformation66  Here, k is the wavelength-dependent
absorption coefficient (k = 4πκ/λ)
and S is a scattering coefficient, assumed to be
constant over the wavelength range. The optical band gap Eg of the SnO2 NPs was assessed by the Tauc
procedure that assumes the absorption coefficient α of a semiconductor
can be expressed as  where A is a material-dependent
constant, h is Planck’s constant, and ν
is the light frequency. The power coefficient γ is characteristic
of the type of transition considered, with a value of 1/2 or 2 depending
on whether the transition is directly or indirectly allowed.67 There is still not agreement on whether the
band-to-band transition in SnO2 NPs is direct or indirect.7,53,54 We tested both solutions to estimate Eg values in our study. We fitted the plots given
by the transformed Kubelka–Munk equation [F(R∞)hν]γ versus hν using a sigmoidal
Boltzmann function (Origin ProLab, version 8.5.0). The x-axis intercept of the line tangent to the inflection point of the
appropriate curve provided direct versus indirect gap model estimates
for each of our SnO2 NP samples.

Liquid-state 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies
were used to investigate the organic species formed during the reaction
and remaining in the supernatant liquid after centrifugation. Spectra
were measured in CDCl3 solutions using a 300 MHz Bruker
AVANCE NMR spectrometer. Solid-state NMR experiments to study the
SnO2 NPs were carried out at ambient probe temperature
on a Bruker AVANCE 300 spectrometer with a 7.05 T wide-bore magnet.
High-resolution solid-state 1H, 13C, and 119Sn NMR spectra were recorded at 300.1, 75.5, and 111.9 MHz,
respectively, using a standard Bruker 4 mm double-resonance MAS probe.
Powdered solid materials were packed into zirconia rotors of 4 mm
external diameter and spun at MAS frequencies of 3–12 kHz with
stability better than ±3 Hz. High-resolution solid-state 13C NMR spectra were recorded using MAS, with high-power proton
decoupling and the pulse sequence of Cory and Ritchey68 with the suppression of extraneous signals originating
from materials outside the NMR coil. Typical acquisition conditions
for 13C NMR experiments were as follows: 13C
90° pulse duration = 3.0 μs; recycle delay = 10 s; number
of transients 6000–17 200. Solid-state 13C MAS spectra
with high-power proton decoupling and cross-polarization (CP) from
protons were also acquired for the sample prepared at 200 °C,
with the following acquisition conditions: 1H 90°
pulse duration = 4.0 μs; recycle delay = 5 s; and number of
transients 3400. However, the 13C CPMAS spectrum showed
a poorer signal-to-noise ratio compared to that acquired using the
sequence of Cory and Ritchey69 with the
direct detection of 13C nuclei. Solid-state 119Sn MAS spectra at 111.9 MHz with and without high-power proton decoupling
were recorded using the following acquisition conditions: 119Sn 60° pulse duration = 1.5 μs; recycle delay = 10–30
s; number of transients 2000–30 000, and MAS frequency = 3–12
kHz. Additionally, 119Sn SSNMR spectra were recorded on
a Bruker AVANCE 600 MHz spectrometer at the resonance frequency of
223.8 MHz using the following acquisition conditions: 119Sn 45° pulse duration = 2.0 μs; recycle delay = 5 s; number
of transients 1500–12 300, and MAS frequency = 10–12
kHz. The sequence used to collect 1H MAS NMR spectra at
300.1 MHz comprised a single-pulse excitation with a 2.4 μs
long pulse (recycle delay = 5 s; number of transients 8–32,
and MAS frequency = 8–12 kHz). The 13C and 1H chemical shifts are given relative to tetramethylsilane
(TMS), which were calibrated using glycine (176.46 ppm) and tetrakis(trimethylstannyl)methane
doped with TMS (0 ppm), respectively. The 119Sn chemical
shifts are given relative to tetramethyltin SnMe4, calibrated
using tetrakis(trimethylstannyl)methane C(SnMe3)4 (48.2 ppm).69 In the case of the 119Sn CSA (Δδ) for SnO2 with δ
< 0, parameters are defined as follows        Here, the principal components
of the chemical
shift tensor, δ11, δ22, and δ33, are defined such that the highest frequency (the least
shielded) component is labeled as δ11, while δ33 corresponds to the lowest frequency (the most shielded)
component.
