Freestanding TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTAs)
were prepared
by an electrochemical method, and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)
were fabricated with the open-ended freestanding TNTAs incorporated
with Au nanoparticles (NPs). Open-ended freestanding TNTAs were prepared
by etching the barrier layer of closed-ended freestanding TNTAs using
an ion milling method, and Au NPs were incorporated into the channel
of the open-ended freestanding TNTAs by an electrodeposition method.
The Au-NP-embedded open-ended freestanding TNTAs were applied to DSSCs
to improve the energy conversion efficiency (ECE) by better electron
generation and electron transport. The ECE of DSSCs based on the closed-ended
freestanding TNTAs with Au NPs increased to 6.116% from 5.502% for
DSSCs based on the closed-ended freestanding TNTAs without Au NPs,
an enhancement of 11.16% because of better electron generation by
the plasmonic and charging effects of the Au NPs. However, the ECE
of DSSCs based on the closed-ended freestanding TNTAs incorporated
with Au NPs for 40 s decreased from 6.116 to 5.336% because aggregation
of the Au NPs led to a decrease in the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor. For enhanced ECE of DSSCs,
the barrier layer of closed-ended freestanding TNTAs was etched by
an ion milling method for 0, 30, 60, or 90 min to provide “open-ended
freestanding TNTAs”. Then, Au NPs were incorporated into the
open-ended freestanding TNTAs. After the barrier layer was completely
removed by the ion milling method for 90 min, the ECE of the DSSCs
reached 7.120% because the electron transport and electrolyte diffusion
were improved by the elimination of the barrier layer of the freestanding
TNTAs.

1 Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells
(DSSCs) are an application of the photosynthesis
principle so the special dyes in the cell generate current like the
chloroplasts in the plant generate oxygen and it flows to external
electrodes. DSSCs have a lower efficiency than crystalline silicon
solar cells, but their manufacturing process is simple and raw materials
are cheap so their production costs is reduced. The first successful
development is known to be that by Michael Grätzel in 1991.1 Since then, scientists have worked on overcoming
the shortcomings of DSSCs to achieve better efficiency. DSSCs consist
of a conducting glass, dye-coated TiO2 electrode, electrolyte
that contains a redox couple reagent, and counter electrode coated
with Pt. The dye-coated TiO2 electrode is the most important
part in DSSCs because it determines the electron generation and transport,
which affect the energy conversion efficiency (ECE).

The TiO2 electrode section can be largely divided into
nanoparticles (NPs) and nanotubes. The TiO2 electrode with
nanoparticles has the advantage of being able to produce many electrons
because of the large surface area of the nanoparticles for the adsorption
of dyes; however, a limitation is the low electron transport because
of a mesoporous structure due to disorderly connections between the
nanoparticles.2−5 As an alternative, by synthesizing TiO2 nanotubes, the
electrons of the TiO2 electrode can be prevented from being
lost while moving toward the transparent electrode, thereby increasing
the ECE.6−11 The synthesis methods for nanotubes are hydrothermal synthesis and
electrochemical synthesis. In hydrothermal synthesis, large quantities
of nanotubes can be synthesized, but there is a downside in the vertical
arrangement. For electrons to travel well within a solar cell, vertically
arranged nanotubes are needed. Consequently, an electrochemical synthesis
method that can synthesize vertically arranged nanotubes must be used,
even though a large amount of nanotubes cannot be obtained. However,
a barrier layer exists in the bottom part of the vertical array nanotubes
made by electrochemical synthesis methods.12,13 This barrier layer interferes with the electron transport and the
electrolyte diffusion inside the DSSCs. Through an ion milling method,
the barrier layer can be removed completely.

DSSCs are devices
that use the principle of turning light into
electricity. While there are some ways to physically eliminate obstacles
to increase efficiency, there are other ways to maximize the benefits
of these devices. One method of improving the light-harvesting ability
of DSSCs is the introduction of metal nanoparticles.14−23 By using metal nanoparticles, the absorption of light is increased
by the surface plasmonic resonance phenomenon that occurs by the interaction
between a negative dielectric constant from a metal and a positive
dielectric constant from a medium. Generally, presynthesized metal
nanoparticles are mixed with TiO2 nanoparticles for plasmonic
DSSCs.19,20 However, it is difficult to introduce the
presynthesized metal nanoparticles into the vertically arranged TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTAs) because of aggregation and interaction.14,15,19,24 By using electrochemical methods, metal nanoparticles can be introduced
easily into TiO2 nanotube arrays because the solution that
contains the metal precursor easily penetrates into the channels of
TiO2 nanotube arrays.

In this study, the barrier
layer of TiO2 nanotube arrays
was etched by an ion milling method for better electron transport
and Au nanoparticles were introduced by an electrochemical method
for better electron generation to improve the ECE of DSSCs. To the
best of our knowledge, Au nanoparticles were first incorporated into
open-ended freestanding TiO2 nanotube arrays and fabricated
DSSCs with Au-nanoparticle-embedded open-ended freestanding TiO2 nanotube arrays. Moreover, we investigated the plasmonic
and charging effect by the amount of Au nanoparticles in DSSCs.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Overall Scheme of Preparation of DSSCs
The preparation of Au-NP-embedded open-ended freestanding TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTAs) and fabrication of DSSCs are represented
in Figure 1. The TNTAs
were prepared by two times anodization of Ti plate. After the 1st
anodization and an annealing step at 500 °C, the “1st
TNTAs” were produced, and these have crystallinity. The 1st
TNTAs are stable in acidic or basic conditions; therefore, a 2nd anodization
was carried out to form small and amorphous “2nd TNTAs”
between the Ti plate and the 1st TNTAs, as shown in Figure 1a. The 2nd TNTAs are amorphous
phase, which means that they are unstable in any acidic or basic conditions
so an oxidizing agent such as H2O2 solution
can remove the 2nd TNTA part.12,25,26 After the 2nd TNTAs were removed, the 1st TNTAs were separated from
the Ti plate and referred to as “freestanding TNTAs”
or “closed-ended freestanding TNTAs”, as shown in Figure 1b. The closed-ended
freestanding TNTAs have a barrier layer under the bottom part. This
barrier layer disturbs the electron transport or transfer between
the TNTAs and the electrode in DSSCs; however, the barrier layer can
be removed by a chemical method or a physical method. With a chemical
method, the barrier layer can be removed by chemical reagents, but
the chemical reagents will damage the TNTAs. However, by using a physical
method such as ion milling, the barrier layer can be removed without
any damage to the TNTAs.27 To increase
the ECE in the DSSCs, the barrier layer of the freestanding TNTAs
was removed by an ion milling method. The resulting TNTAs are called
“open-ended freestanding TNTAs” and are shown in Figure 1c. The open-ended
freestanding TNTAs were attached to fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)
glass with TiO2 paste and connected by an annealing step
at 500 °C under the ambient condition, as shown in Figure 1d. The FTO glass with open-ended
freestanding TNTAs was dipped in Au solution and a constant voltage
of 5 V DC was applied to incorporate the Au NPs from the Au precursor
into the open-ended freestanding TNTAs as shown in Figure 1e. Finally, the DSSCs were
fabricated using the FTO glass with the Au-NP-embedded open-ended
freestanding TNTAs. In the completed DSSCs, the Au-NP-embedded open-ended
freestanding TNTAs act as a “working electrode” and
Pt-coated FTO acts as a “counter electrode”. The electrolyte
was injected between the working electrode and the counter electrode,
and the fabricated DSSCs are shown in Figure 1f.

2.2 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy
(FE-SEM) and Element Mapping Images of TNTAs and Au NPs
FE-SEM
images of the top of the TNTAs are shown in Figure 2a, and the pore diameter of the TNTAs is
approximately 100 nm. FE-SEM images of the side view of the TNTAs
are shown in Figure 2b, and the length of the TNTAs is approximately 18 μm. The
Au NPs are well-incorporated into the TNTAs as shown by the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images in Figure 2c. The vertical lines are the wall of the
TNTAs and the black dots are Au NPs embedded in the TNTAs. The size
of the Au NPs is different in the single phase because the position
of the Au NPs is also different. However, the average size of the
Au NPs is approximately 60 nm. The images of element mappings are
shown in Figure 2d,e.
The green elements represent the position of TNTAs, and the shape
is a vertical line, while the red elements are the Au NPs. The positions
of TNTAs and Au NPs shown by the element mappings are the same as
their positions in the TEM images.

by FE-SEM images, (c) Au NPs into the channel of TNTAs by TEM, (d)
The wall of TNTAs, and (e) Au NPs by element mappings.

2.3 FE-SEM Images of Barrier Layer of TNTAs
When the DSSCs were fabricated by Au NPs embedded in the closed-ended
freestanding TNTAs, the ECE was improved because the Au NPs are able
to enhance the electrons generated by plasmonic and charging effects
in the DSSCs. However, the barrier layer portion of the closed-ended
TNTAs interrupts the electron transport and electrolyte diffusion
inside the completed DSSCs. To overcome this problem and improve the
ECE, the bottom surface of the TNTAs was removed by ion milling, a
physical method, as shown in Figure 3. The SEM image of the closed-ended freestanding TNTAs
before ion milling is shown in Figure 3a, and the SEM images of the ion-milled TNTAs are shown
in Figure 3b–d,
filmed at a time interval of 30, 60, and 90 min, respectively. The
etching process of the bottom surface is shown as time increases,
with the pores being gradually exposed after 30 and 60 min of the
ion milling process. After 90 min, the pores of the TNTAs were completely
etched as shown in Figure 3d to produce open-ended freestanding TNTAs, and these were
used to fabricate DSSCs.

0 min, (b) 30 min,

2.4 X-ray Diffraction (XRD) of TNTAs and Au NPs
The crystal phase structure of the TNTAs and Au NPs was confirmed
by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD patterns of each of FTO, TNTAs,
and TNTAs incorporated with Au NPs are shown in Figure 4. In the XRD patterns of the FTO, the blue
line (a) of Figure 4, the peaks such as the (110), (101), (111), (211), (002), and (112)
planes are represented. In the XRD patterns of the anatase TNTA phase,
the red line (b) of Figure 4, the peaks such as the (101), (200), (105), (211), (204),
(116), (220), and (215) planes are represented at 2θ = 25.35,
47.95, 54.05, 55.15, 62.80, 69.05, 70.40, and 75.10°, respectively.
In the XRD patterns of the anatase TNTAs incorporated with Au NPs,
the black line (c) of Figure 4, the peaks such as the (111), (200), and (220) planes are
represented at 2θ = 38.30, 44.25, and 64.45°, respectively.
The XRD measurements were used to verify the success of the steps
required for the introduction of the metal (Au) NPs to the TNTAs,
and it was confirmed that Au NPs were well-incorporated into the TNTAs
by the electrochemical method.

with Au NPs.

2.5 UV–vis Spectra Result of TNTAs and
Au NPs
The UV–vis spectra results of TNTAs with Au
NPs incorporated by the electrodeposition method for 0, 10, 20, 30,
and 40 s are shown in Figure 5. Without Au NPs embedded in the freestanding TNTAs, a smooth
graph is shown through 400–800 nm as shown in Figure 5a. The extinction peaks of
the Au NPs from 5 to 80 nm are 514–550 nm,28−30 which is well-matched
to the N719 dye in the DSSCs whose absorbance range is from 340 to
540 nm.18,31 When the Au NPs were incorporated into the
TNTAs by an electrodeposition method for 10 s, a special peak is represented
at 530 nm as shown in Figure 5b. By increasing the electrodeposition time from 10 to 30
s, the signal of the special peak becomes stronger as shown in Figure 5b–d. The amount
of Au NPs is controlled by the reduction time during the electrodeposition
and the strongest signal is confirmed at 530 nm for 30 s, as shown
in Figure 5d. A longer
electrodeposition time causes a greater amount of Au NPs to be incorporated
into the freestanding TNTAs; however, as with no Au NPs, there are
no peaks at 530 nm when the Au NPs were incorporated for 40 s, as
shown in Figure 5e.
This is because of the aggregation of the Au NPs whose extinction
is not matched to the absorbance of the N719 dye.32

electrodeposition method for (a) 0 s, (b) 10 s, (c) 20 s, (d) 30 s,
and (e) 40 s.

2.6 Photovoltaic Properties of DSSCs Based on
Closed-Ended TNTAs with Au NPs
The photovoltaic properties
of DSSCs based on the closed-ended TNTAs with Au NPs were measured
under the one sun condition. To determine the optimum amount of Au
NPs to produce the best efficiency, we measured DSSCs based on the
closed-ended TNTAs with Au NPs incorporated for 40 s at 10-second
intervals. The results are shown in Figure 6 and the values for each short-circuit density
(Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (ff), and energy conversion efficiency
(ECE, η) are summarized in Table 1. The ECE of DSSCs with Au NPs incorporated for 10
s increased slightly to 5.678% from 5.502% for the DSSCs without Au
NPs because of an increase in the Voc and
in spite of a similar Jsc. It means that
electrons are generated by the Au NPs, and this affects the electron
density of the TNTAs. The higher electron density affects the Fermi
level of the TNTAs, and then the Voc is
increased by the “charging effect”.17 The ECE of DSSCs with Au NPs incorporated for 30 s increased
to 6.116% from 5.502% for the DSSCs without Au NPs and showed the
highest efficiency. In this case, the Jsc, Voc, and ff are increased, and this
affects the ECE. Especially, there is a large increase in the Jsc from 10.626 to 11.828 mA cm–2, which means that many electrons are generated by the “plasmonic
effect”; however, some electrons are recombined with the Au
NPs because of the decreased electron density of the TNTAs. The decreasing
electron density means a decreasing Fermi level of the TNTAs, which
affects the ff and Voc and has a negative
effect on the photovoltaic properties of the DSSCs. When the DSSCs
were fabricated with Au NPs incorporated for 40 s, the ECE immediately
decreased. For the DSSCs with Au NPs incorporated for 40 s, the Jsc, Voc, and ff
also decreased because the generated electrons from the dye were recombined
by the Au NPs, and the electron density also decreased in the active
layer of the TNTAs because of the aggregation of the Au NPs as shown
in Figure 5e.

2.7 Photovoltaic Properties of DSSCs Based on
Open-Ended TNTAs with Au NPs
The photovoltaic properties
of DSSCs based on the open-ended TNTAs with Au NPs were measured under
the one sun condition (Figure 7), and the values of Jsc, Voc, ff, and η are summarized in Table 2. The bottom layer
of the freestanding TNTAs was etched by the ion milling method for
0, 30, 60, or 90 min, and Au NPs were incorporated by the electrodeposition
method for 30 s. The ECE value gradually increased to 6.116, 6.688,
7.031, and 7.120% with increased ion milling time. The ECE value of
7.120% is one of the highest for DSSCs based on the open-ended freestanding
TNTAs whose bottom part is completely removed as shown in Figure 3d. Among the photovoltaic
properties, Jsc and Voc are also gradually increased with the decrease in the
barrier layer until finally the ECE reached 7.120%. This means that
the electron generation of all the DSSCs is similar, but the electron
transport and electrolyte diffusion are improved by the removal of
the barrier layer of the TNTAs.

2.8 Electrochemical Impedance Spectra (EIS) of
DSSCs Based on Open-Ended TNTAs with Au NPs
To confirm the
effects on electron transport and electrolyte diffusion by the barrier
layer in DSSCs, the DSSCs were measured by electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy. The resulting electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS)
for the DSSCs based on the TNTAs whose barrier layer was etched by
the ion milling method for 0, 30, 60, or 90 min are shown in Figure 8, and the fit parameters
are summarized in Table 3. Each spectrum contains two different semicircles. The series resistance Rs is caused by the parallel resistance of the
FTO, and it corresponds to the value of the x-axis where the small
semicircle begins. The value of Rs is
similar with increasing ion milling time because the barrier layer
may have very little effect on Rs. The
small semicircle that has high frequency contains the parallel resistance
and capacitance at the Pt-FTO/electrolyte and the FTO/TNTAs. The sum
of the interfacial resistance of the FTO/TNTAs and Pt/electrolyte
represents the value of R1. The value
of R1 decreases with increasing ion milling
time because of the change in the interfacial property of the FTO/TNTAs
with reduction in the thickness of the barrier layer, which means
that electron transport and transfer will be improved by the elimination
of the barrier layer under the TNTAs. The larger semicircle that has
low frequency contains resistance and capacitance of the dye-absorbed
TNTAs/electrolyte interface and transport resistance in the TNTAs.
The sum of the transfer resistance at the dye–TNTAs/electrolyte
interface and the transport resistance in the TNTAs represent the
value of R2. The value of R2 decreases significantly with increasing ion milling
time, which means that the electrolyte may penetrate into the channel
of the TNTAs. From the EIS fit parameters, it is shown that the electron
transport and transfer and electrolyte diffusion are improved by the
elimination of the barrier layer under the TNTAs in the DSSCs.

3 Conclusions
In summary, the barrier
layer of closed-ended freestanding TNTAs
is well-removed by an ion milling method and Au NPs were successfully
incorporated into open-ended freestanding TNTAs by an electrodeposition
method. The barrier layer of the closed-ended freestanding TNTAs was
gradually etched by increasing the ion milling time until the barrier
layer was perfectly removed and opened. The amount of Au NPs was controlled
by the electrodeposition time, and the extinction of Au NPs was well-matched
to the absorbance of dye (N719). DSSCs based on the open-ended TNTAs
with Au NPs were fabricated, and an ECE of 7.120% was achieved because
of improved electron transport and electron generation due to the
elimination of the barrier layer and presence of Au NPs. Our research
has great potential for other solar cells by suggesting a way to improve
electron transport and electrolyte diffusion through the removal of
the barrier layer of TNTAs and increase in the light-harvesting availability
through introducing Au NPs and has many applications such as photocatalyst,
display, biology, Li-ion batteries, gas sensor, or supercapacitor.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of Freestanding TNTAs
TNTAs were fabricated by anodizing Ti plate purchased from Alfa Aesar
with a purity of 99.7% and thickness of 0.25 mm. The electrolyte was
composed of 0.8 wt % of NH4F and 2 vol % H2O
in ethylene glycol, and a 1st Ti anodization was carried out at 25
°C with a constant applied voltage of 60 V DC for 2 h. The 1st
TNTAs formed on the Ti plate were annealed at 500 °C for 1 h
under ambient air to improve their crystallinity. After the 1st anodization,
a 2nd Ti anodization was carried out at a constant applied voltage
of 30 V DC for 15 min, and then the plate was dipped in 10% H2O2 to separate the TNTAs from the Ti plate. The
barrier layer of the TNTAs was removed by ion milling with Ar+ bombardment for various time intervals. After the ion milling
step, the open-ended TNTAs were prepared.

4.2 Fabrication of DSSCs
A TiO2 blocking layer was formed on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass
by spin-coating with 5 wt % of titanium di-isopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate)
in butanol. This was then annealed at 500 °C for 1 h under the
ambient condition for crystallinity. The TiO2 paste was
coated on the TiO2 blocking layer by the doctor blade method,
and then open-ended freestanding TNTAs were transferred to the TiO2 paste layer. The size of TNTAs is 0.5 cm × 5 cm, and
the active area of DSSC is 0.25 cm2. To enhance the adhesion
between the FTO glass and open-ended freestanding TNTAs, the substrate
was annealed at 500 °C for 1 h under ambient condition. Au NPs
were incorporated into the open-ended freestanding TNTAs with 10 mM
HAuCl4 in an H2O and ethanol (50:50, v/v) solution
by an electrodeposition method at a constant applied voltage of 5
V DC. After the electrodeposition process, the Au-embedded open-ended
freestanding TNTAs were coated with TiCl4 at 50 °C
for 30 min and annealed at 500 °C for 1 h to prevent the redox
reaction between Au NPs and electrolyte. The prepared substrate was
immersed in a dye ((Bu4N)2Ru(dobpyH)2(NCS)2; N719, Solaronix) solution at 50 °C for 8
h, and then a counter electrode (Pt-sputtered FTO glass) covered the
working electrode. Also, the electrodes were separated by a 60 μm
thick hot-melt sheet. After that, the electrolyte, which consisted
of 0.7 M 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.1 M guanidium thiocyanate, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine
in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15, v/v), was injected between
the electrodes.

4.3 Characterization
The morphology,
thickness, and pore size of freestanding TNTAs were confirmed by using
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; JSM-6330F, JEOL
Inc). The incorporation of Au NPs into the freestanding TNTAs was
confirmed by using Cs-corrected field emission transmission electron
microscopy (Cs-FE-TEM; JEM-ARM-200F, JEOL Inc.) at the Center for
University-Wide Research Facilities (CURF) at Jeonbuk National University.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs were confirmed by an electrometer
(Keithley 2400) under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm–2) that was provided by a solar simulator (1 kW xenon). The electrochemical
impedance spectra were measured with a potentiostat (Solartron 1287)
equipped with a frequency response analyzer (Solartron 1260), with
the frequency ranging from 10–2 to 106 Hz. The applied bias voltage and ac amplitude were set at the open-circuit
voltage (Voc) of the DSSCs and 10 mV under
AM 1.5 one-sun light illumination. Also, the electrochemical impedance
spectra were analyzed by using Z-View software (Solartron Analytical)
with the aid of an appropriate equivalent circuit.
