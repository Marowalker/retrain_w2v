Overexpression of the eukaryotic
initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is
linked to a variety of cancers. Both mitogen-activated protein kinases-interacting
kinases 1 and 2 (Mnk1/2) activate the oncogene eIF4E through posttranslational
modification (phosphorylating it at the conserved Ser209). Inhibition
of Mnk prevents eIF4E phosphorylation, making the Mnk–eIF4E
axis a potential therapeutic target for oncology. Recently, the design
and synthesis of a series of novel potent compounds inhibiting the
Mnk1/2 kinases were carried out in-house. Here, we describe computational
models of the interactions between Mnk1/2 kinases and these inhibitors.
Molecular modeling combined with free energy calculations show that
these compounds bind to the inactive forms of the kinases. All compounds
adopt similar conformations in the catalytic sites of both kinases,
stabilized by hydrogen bonds with the hinge regions and with the catalytic
Lys78 (Mnk1) and Lys113 (Mnk2). These hydrogen bond interactions clearly
play a critical role in determining the conformational stability and
potency of the compounds. We also find that van der Waals interactions
with an allosteric pocket are key to their binding and potency. Two
distinct hydration sites that appear to further stabilize the ligand
binding/interactions were observed. Critically, the inclusion of explicit
water molecules in the calculations results in improving the agreement
between calculated and experimental binding free energies.

Introduction
Mitogen-activated protein
kinases-interacting kinases 1 and 2 (Mnk1/2)
are Ser/Thr kinases from the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
kinase family. They both activate the eukaryotic initiation factor
4E (eIF4E) by phosphorylating it at the conserved Ser209.1−3 eIF4E initiates the translation of messenger RNAs into proteins.
It has been found to be overexpressed in several cancers.4 This makes the Mnk-eIF4E axis a potential therapeutic
target for oncology.5−7 Indeed, it has been demonstrated that simultaneous
inhibition of an oncogenic kinase (mTOR, BCR-ABL, and MEK) together
with that of Mnk kinases results in downregulation of protein synthesis,
cell cycle progression, and proliferation of prostate cancer cells
and chronic myeloid leukemia cells in the blast crisis stage, and
in neurofibromin 1 mutant cancers.8−10 There is a growing interest
in developing Mnk inhibitors even as two compounds have recently entered
clinical trials.11,12

The catalytic domains of
Mnk1/2 share ∼80% sequence identity.
In contrast to other protein kinases, Mnk1/2 kinases contain special
inserts (I1, I2, and I3) and a distinct Asp–Phe–Asp
(DFD) motif (Figure S1). The experimental
structures of the active conformations of the kinase domains of Mnk1
and Mnk2 display a bilobal catalytic domain seen in protein kinases,
which sandwiches the adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) pocket
between the N- and C-terminal lobes (Figure S1). The N-terminal lobe is made up of a twisted sheet of five antiparallel
β-strands (β1−β5) and the regulatory helix
αC. It harbors the P-loop (residues 51–62 in Mnk1 and
86–97 in Mnk2) which is rich in glycines, a conserved lysine
(Lys78 in Mnk1 and Lys113 in Mnk2), and a conserved glutamic acid
(Glu94 in Mnk1 and Glu129 in Mnk2) (Figure 1). These two residues form a critical salt bridge which is conserved
across the active conformations of kinases. Together, these elements
orchestrate the binding of ATP. The C-terminal lobe is largely made
up on α-helices and binds the peptide substrate and enables
phosphate transfer. The Mnk kinases are characterized by a noncanonical
Asp191Phe192Asp193 motif in Mnk1
and Asp226Phe227Asp228 motif in Mnk2;
this contrasts with the more common Asp–Phe–Gly motif.

Figure 1 Models
of Mnk1 and Mnk2 kinases based on homology. Different structural
elements are highlighted: P-loop (green), hinge region (red), catalytic
loop (magenta), DFD motif (blue), and αC helix (orange).

Mnk1 has been crystallized in
an autoinhibited form (PDB id 2HW6, resolution 2.6
Å).13 Phe230 from the Mnk1-specific
insertion region lies in a hydrophobic allosteric pocket which lies
adjacent to the ATP binding pocket; the pocket is created by the residues
Glu94, Leu98, Cys101, Gln102, Ile107, Leu108, Leu161, Ile166, Ala167,
His168, Ile189, and Cys190 in Mnk1 (Figure S2). In other kinases, the active state is characterized by the Phe
from the DFG motif inserted into this hydrophobic allosteric pocket,
whereas in the inactive state, the Type II inhibitors occupy this
region. A crystal structure of the Mnk2 kinase in a DFD-out state
has also been resolved (PDB id 2AC3, resolution 2.1 Å).14 In contrast to Mnk1, Mnk2 is not autoinhibited, and the
activation loop adopts an extended conformation. Similar to other
kinases, in the inactive form of the Mnk2 kinase, the displacement
of Phe158 from the DFD motif (its DFG motif in other kinases) creates
an allosteric pocket adjacent to the ATP binding pocket constituted
by residues Glu129, Leu133, Cys136, Gln137, Val142, Leu143, Leu196,
Ile201, Ala202, His203, Ile223, and Cys224. Structural information
for a majority of the activation loop (A-loop) and Mnk-specific insertions
is missing.

The most investigated group of Mnk kinase inhibitors
are ATP-competitive
molecules that bind to the active conformation (DFD-in) of the kinases,
mimicking the interactions of the adenine ring of ATP; these are referred
to as the Type I inhibitors, as has been highlighted earlier too.15 Recently, a novel series of inhibitors that
target the inactive conformations of the Mnk kinases with nanomolar
to micromolar affinities have been developed in-house;16−18 these are referred to as the Type II inhibitors. We report here
a study that combines molecular modeling and molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations exploring the kinase–inhibitor interactions. We
had earlier used a similar protocol to successfully probe the binding
of novel Type I (imidazopyridine and imidazopyrazine derivatives)
Mnk1/2 inhibitors.15 In this study, we
further report that water molecules play a novel role by stabilizing
the interactions of the Type II inhibitors with the Mnk1/2 kinases.

Results
and Discussions
Homology Modeling and Refinement
There are no atomic
structures of wildtype Mnk1/2 in their inactive states; hence, we
used the available crystal structure of the calmodulin-domain protein
kinase 119 (∼35% amino acid identity)
in its inactive state as a template to build their models; these models
were additionally constrained by the available structures of Mnk1/2
as mentioned in the Materials and Methods section.
The generated models are structurally similar to the templates used,
with a root mean squared deviation (rmsd) ranging from ∼1.3
to 1.5 Å. Unlike the crystal structure of the Mnk1 kinase, the
modeled structure is in the inactive form of the kinase, with both
the ATP binding pocket and the adjacent allosteric pocket accessible
to inhibitors. These models were refined by atomistic MD simulations
in explicit water. During the MD simulations, both kinases remained
stable (within ∼3–4 Å of the non A-loop regions
of the starting states); only the A-loop exhibited large flexibility
and conformational changes (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Structural deviations of the modeled conformations of
Mnk1 (A)
and Mnk2 (B) sampled during the MD simulations. RMSD (root mean square
devialtion) is calculated after superposition of each conformation
from the MD trajectory on the respective homology models of all residues
(black), excluding the activation loop (red).

The ligand binding pocket in the Mnk1/2 kinases share ∼85%
sequence identity with very similar overall electrostatic potentials
and small differences in the hinge region, P-loop, and at the allosteric
pocket (Figure 3).

(right) are highlighted as sticks and labeled accordingly; structural
elements are highlighted: P-loop (green), hinge region (red), catalytic
loop (magenta), DFD motif (blue), and αC helix (orange).

Ligand Docking
A set of Type II small-molecule inhibitors
that were developed in-house17 and have
been shown to inhibit the activity of Mnk kinases with IC50 values ranging from nM to μM (Table 1) were docked into the catalytic sites of
Mnk1/2 kinases in their modeled active (DFD-in) and inactive (DFD-out)
conformations. For docking calculations, a protocol that was developed
and benchmarked earlier15 to successfully
probe the binding of novel (imidazopyridine and imidazopyrazine derivatives)
Mnk1/2 inhibitors was used. Reasonable docked poses were observed
only for the inactive forms of the kinases. As these compounds are
relatively large, binding of these compounds requires a large pocket
which exists only in the inactive form of the kinase (Figure S3; in the active form, the restricted
pocket size results in the docked conformations with the compound
largely exposed to the solvent). The compounds considered in this
study are also structurally similar to other kinase inhibitors that
are known to bind to the inactive forms of the kinases, such as imatinib
bound to BCR-ABL (PDB 2HYY) and ponatinib bound to BCR-ABL (PDB 3OXZ), for which several
crystal structures are available. On the basis of this, we chose the
compounds bound to the inactive forms of Mnk1/2 for subsequent analysis.
On the basis of the binding mode, parts of these compounds can be
referred to as the following: (1) hinge binders:
parts of compounds that interact with the hinge region of the kinase,
(2) allosteric pocket binders: parts of compounds
that occupy the allosteric pocket created by the flipping of Phe in
the DFD-out conformation, (3) linker region: parts
of compounds that connect the hinge binders with the allosteric pocket
binders, and (4) tail part: the extension of the
allosteric binders and are regions that interact with the A-loop (Figure 4).

Table 1 Structure and Activities of Type II
Mnk Inhibitorsa
a Activities are given as inhibition
constant (IC50); values are in nanomolar (nM).

Examining the models of the compounds
listed in Table 1 docked
to Mnk1/2, it can be
seen that the ATP pocket is occupied by pyridine (compounds 2 and 4), cyanopyridine (compound 6), acetopyridine (compound 1), acetamidopyridine (compound 18), indazole (compound 3), pyrrolo(3,4-b)pyridine (compounds 8, 10, and 21), pyrazolopyridine (compounds 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, and 20), dimethylfuran (compound 5), and methylimidazole (compound 9). The substituents on these 5- or 6-membered rings interact
with the hinge region through one or two hydrogen bonds with the backbone
atoms of Leu127 (Mnk1) or Met162 (Mnk2) and through van der Waals
(vdW) packing interactions with residues from the hinge region and
the P-loop. It is clear that the hydrogen bonds in the ATP binding
pocket are key determinants of affinity because their removal (compounds 3, 5, and 9) results in reduced
potency. In addition, the trifluoromethyl moiety, common to all molecules,
occupies the allosteric pocket formed by residues Cys101, Ile59, Leu113,
Ile141, and Cys142 in Mnk1 and Cys136, Val142, Leu196, Ile224, and
Cys225 in Mnk2. These interactions are all driven by vdW interactions.
The allosteric binder is another important contributor for the binding
and potency of Type II inhibitors, as most of this class of inhibitors
has either a phenyl or a halogenated phenyl as the allosteric binder.
The linker regions are made up of phenoxyacetamide (compounds 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 15, and 16), flurophenoxyacetamide (compounds 2, 10, 11, 13, and 17), flurobenzylacetamide
(compound 14), hydroxyphenylurea (compound 1), fluroanilinoacetamide (compound 7, 19, and 20), dihydrobenzoxazinacetamide (compound 21), and difluoro-phenoxyacetamide (compound 18). The linker amide (except compound 1) is involved
in hydrogen bond interactions with the backbone carbonyl of Asp191
(Mnk1)/Asp226 (Mnk2) and with the side chain of catalytic Lys78 (Mnk1)/Lys113
(Mnk2). Compound 1 has a urea as the linker but is involved
in hydrogen bond interactions which are similar to those made by amide
linkers. Although most linkers are well-tolerated, substitutions such
as difluoro as in the case of compound 18 are clearly
not tolerated; this results from the substitutions sterically clashing
with the kinases at this position. The phenoxy group from the linkers
is sandwiched between Phe124 (gate keeper residue) and Phe219 from
the DFD motif in Mnk1 and Phe158 (gate keeper residue) and Phe227
from the DFD motif in Mnk2. Both the unsubstituted (compounds 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 15, 16, and 18) and fluoro-substituted phenoxy-containing
compounds (compounds 2, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19, and 20) have comparable activity;
however, other substitutions (cyanophenoxy in compound 4 and dihydrobenzoxazin in compound 21) are not tolerated
as the large substitutions will have steric clashes at this position
and resulted in reduced potency with IC50 in the micromolar
range. The tail regions of all compounds contain either piperazine
(compounds 8, 10, 11, 12 14, 15, 16, 18,
and 19) or substituted piperazine, that is, methylpiperazine
(compounds 13 and 21), ethylpiperazine (compounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 17), or isopropylpiperzine
(compound 20). The nitrogen atom from the piperazine
engages in hydrogen bond interactions with the carbonyl backbone of
Ala167 (Mnk1)/Ala202 (Mnk2) and is the most diverse region among the
compounds. It is clear that the tail region interaction is also very
important for activity, as compound 7 which lacks the
tail region has reduced potency.

The resultant docking scores
showed a poor correlation with experimental
data (Figure 5A,B);
this is not unexpected from current docking approaches.20 To circumvent this, we subjected all docked
complexes to MD simulations.

score (glide energy)
and MMPBSA binding free energies (ΔGbind) without water (C,D) and with water (E,F) and the experimental pIC50 values for (left) Mnk1 and (right) Mnk2. The dashed lines
indicate the separation of binders and binders based on the predicted
binding energies.

MD Simulations of Protein–Inhibitor
Complexes
The stability of the complexes during the MD simulations
as judged
by their structural deviations was deemed satisfactory (rmsd of ∼4
Å in the receptor atoms excluding the activation loop; Figure 6). The bound Type
II inhibitors do not deviate by more than ∼2 Å from their
starting conformations. Although we did not witness the exit from
the binding pocket of any of the inactive compounds, they did show
increased flexibility when bound to Mnk1 (Figure 6). While it is known that unbinding events
probably require simulations of much longer timescales,21 in our study, extension of MD simulations to
a microsecond did not show any unbinding event.

complexes sampled during the MD simulations. RMSD of Mnk1 (A) and
Mnk2 (B); rms of compounds bound to Mnk1 (C) and Mnk2 (D).

The protein–inhibitor interactions were
generally conserved
during the MD simulations. Hydrogen bonds between the inhibitors and
receptors, especially the interactions with the hinge regions of kinases,
are known to play a key role in drug inhibition.22 Several hydrogen bonds between the inhibitors and the kinases
are seen in the simulations. The hydrogen bonds between the molecules
and the Leu127-NH/Met162-NH located in the hinge regions of Mnk1/2
were stable (except compounds 5 and 9) during
the simulations. The fact that the two weak inhibitors, compounds 5 and 9, do not form this hydrogen bond, suggests
that this interaction is important. It is likely that the absence
of this hydrogen bonding results in increased flexibility of compounds 5 and 9 during the simulations. Two different
kinds of interactions were observed for the amide linker: (1) hydrogen
bonding between the Asp191-NH/Asp226-NH in Mnk1/2 and linker oxygens,
and between the side chain oxygens of Glu94/Glu129 in Mnk1/2 and the
linker amide nitrogen and (2) hydrogen bonding between the backbone
carbonyl of Asp191 in Mnk1/Asp226 in Mnk2 with linker amide nitrogen,
and between the side chain nitrogen of Lys78 in Mnk1/Lys113 in Mnk2
with linker carbonyl oxygen. In addition to the hydrogen bond at the
hinge region, the hydrogen bond involving the amide linker is important
for stabilizing the bound conformations of these inhibitors. The stacking
between the phenyl ring of the phenoxy group in all compounds with
Phe124 and Phe219 in Mnk1 and Ph158 and Phe227 in Mnk2 is also well-preserved
in those cases where the compound is involved in stable interactions
with the hinge region. The trifluoromethyl (CF3) moiety
remains buried into the hydrophobic pocket and hydrogen bond interactions
between the positively charged piperazine, and Ala167 (Mnk1)/Ala202
(Mnk2) are well-preserved throughout the simulations.

In addition
to the contacts made directly between the inhibitors
with the kinase residues, water molecules are also known to play a
critical role in inhibitor recognition, stabilization, and potency.23−27 The structured water molecule is also thought to modulate selectivity
among kinase inhibitors.24−27 In our simulations, we find two distinct hydration
sites. The first site corresponds to the hinge region, where we found
water molecules (different numbers of water molecules for different
inhibitors) with high residence times. Some of these water molecules
are also involved in water-mediated hydrogen bonds between the kinases
and the inhibitors. For example, amine nitrogen from the hinge binder
of compound 16 is involved in water-mediated hydrogen
bond interactions with the side chains of Ser131 and Ser166 from Mnk1
and Mnk2, respectively, and this interaction is well-preserved throughout
the simulations (Figure 7). The second hydration site corresponds to the linker binding region,
where we found one, two, or three water molecules with high residence
times. The water molecules interact with the amide linkers from the
inhibitors and the sidechains of catalytic residues Lys78 (Mnk1)/Lys113
(Mnk2) and Glu94 (Mnk1)/Glu129 (Mnk2) from the αC helix. This
highly ordered water-mediated interaction was preserved in ∼95%
of the simulation time (Figure 7).

Figure 7 MD snapshots illustrating the interactions between compound 18 with Mnk1; active site residues of Mnk1/2 are shown as
lines; hydrogen bonding interactions are indicated by the dashed lines
(magenta). The kinase residues involved in hydrogen bond interactions
are labeled accordingly. Water molecules involved in the protein–inhibitor
interaction are shown as sphere (red), and the hydration sites are
shown as a mesh (magenta).

Interestingly, the water molecules that we observed in the
simulations
of Mnk1/2–inhibitor complexes are conserved in many structures
of active kinases bound to nucleotides and inhibitors and are involved
in interactions between the catalytic residues Lys and Glu of the
kinases with the nucleotide or inhibitors. We speculate that this
water-mediated hydrogen bond network may contribute to the structural
stability of the bound forms of the inhibitors.

Binding Free
Energies
Binding free energies (ΔH) calculated between the 42 complexes of Mnk1/2 and inhibitors
showed very poor correlation (r2 = 0.24
and 0.3 for Mnk1 and Mnk2, respectively) with IC50, although
there was distinct improvement over the correlations from the docking
scores. The inclusion of the entropy term (TΔS) improved the correlation (Figure 5c,d) (r2 = 0.47
and 0.46 for Mnk1 and Mnk2, respectively); however, no linear relationship
was observed (Table 2).

In the
42 complexes, it is clear that the nonbonded energies (van
der Waals, electrostatics) and nonpolar solvation drive inhibitor
binding to the Mnk1/2 kinases and are offset by unfavorable polar
solvation and entropy. The nonpolar energies (vdW + SA) contribute
the most to binding (∼−76 to −55 kcal/mol) and
appear to be correlated best with activity. This indicates that shape
complementarity between the inhibitors and the binding pocket is the
major determinant of binding. This term also separates the actives
(contribution ≈ −81.7 kcal/mol) from the inactives (contribution
≈ −65.3 kcal/mol). Unfavorable contributions from the
polar energies (ΔGelec) suggest
that desolvation opposes binding. An unfavorable entropy term (−TΔS) contributes significantly, and
the magnitude is similar to the electrostatic contributions. This
is expected because the ligands will have greater flexibility in the
solution (Table 3).

Most residues
from the binding pockets of the kinases make similar
energetic contributions to binding in all complexes studied (Figure 8), further supporting
the hypothesis used in our models, that all inhibitors adopt similar
binding modes. Unsurprisingly, most favorable interactions are formed
by residues in the active sites and in the allosteric sites of the
kinases. These are either hydrophobic interactions or residues interacting
with the inhibitor through hydrogen bonds. The above observations
were also mirrored in the interactions of the Type I inhibitors bound
to the active sites of the Mnk1/2 kinases, as reported earlier.15

Effect of Inclusion of
Explicit Water Molecules during MMPBSA
Water can act both
as a hydrogen bond donor and as an acceptor.
Although the effects of water at biomolecular interfaces have been
hard to quantify and have traditionally been ignored in MM(PB/GB)SA
calculations, recent studies treating water molecules as part of the
receptor during molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann surface
area (MMPBSA) calculations have shown improved correlations between
the predicted and experimental affinities.27−32 The problem gets more complex when there are multiple waters at
the interfaces. Recently, Maffucci et al.27 have systematically investigated this by computing the MMGBSA affinities
when different numbers of water molecules were explicitly included
(10–50 water molecules) and found that in their system, 30
interfacial water molecules resulted in improved correlation between
the predicted and experimental affinities by up to 30%, compared to
the calculations without waters.

The MM/PBSA calculations with
the inclusion of explicit water molecules showed improved correlation
with experimental IC50, with the correlation coefficient
(r2) reaching values of 0.6 and 0.8 for
Mnk1 and Mnk2, respectively (Figure 9). Although increased correlation was observed until
about 10 water molecules, it decreased upon the inclusion of 20 water
molecules; similar observations have also been reported in other studies.27 Earlier studies have shown that the inclusion
of 20–30 interfacial water molecules explicitly is optimal
to yield the highest correlation between the MMPBSA and experimental
binding affinities. The optimal number of explicit water molecules
found here is less than what has been reported for other ligand–receptor
complexes and is probably due to the smaller interface between the
Mnk1/2 kinases and the Type II inhibitors(Table 4).

The active sites of Mnk1 and Mnk2 differ in 8 amino acids (as shown
in Figure 3). In Mnk1,
residues Leu54, Thr97, and Leu127 have branched sidechains without
much conformational degrees of freedom and hence pack against the
inhibitors. By contrast, Mnk2 has Val, Met and Met at the corresponding
positions. These larger and linear sidechains in Mnk2 allow for flexibility
which in turn appears to enable, in general, better packing of the
inhibitors, by accommodating more water molecules; this number, of
course, varies between compounds (Figure 9).

Conclusions
In this study, the interactions between
the kinase domains of the
Mnk1/2 kinases and a set of Type II inhibitors which bind to the inactive
forms of the kinases are detailed using molecular modeling and MD
simulations. Structural models of the catalytic domains of inactive
(DFD-out) Mnk1/2 were built by homology and refined using MD simulations.
An ensemble of simulated conformations was used to dock the Type II
inhibitors into their binding sites. All compounds occupy the ATP
binding site and an allosteric pocket with very similar binding modes.
These complexes remained stable during MD simulations. Stability was
governed by hydrophobic interactions between the inhibitors and the
kinases and hydrogen bonds between the inhibitors and the catalytic
Lys78, Asp191 (Mnk1), and Lys113, Asp226 (Mnk2) and Leu127 (Mnk1),
Met162 (Mnk2) and Ala167 (Mnk1), Ala202 (Mnk2) modulating the stability.
The hydrogen bonds appear to enhance the electrostatic interactions
of the inhibitors, resulting in their improved binding affinities.
Two distinct hydration sites that appear to further stabilize the
ligand binding/interactions were observed. A decent correlation between
the computed interaction energies and experimental affinities was
found to be improved upon the inclusion of explicit water molecules.
Binding of the inhibitors is largely driven by van der Waals packing
against the hydrophobic residues in the binding sites and the associated
nonpolar solvation. In summary, this study provides structural and
energetic details of the interactions between a set of Type II inhibitors
and inactive Mnk1/2 kinases in their DFD-out states, offering a basis
for the design of new potent inhibitors with the novel finding that
structural water molecules play an important role and should be considered
when designing new inhibitors.

Materials and Methods
The methodology
adopted was as follows: (a) building the homology
models of the Mnk1/2 kinases in their inactive conformations (given
that there are no crystal structures); (b) MD simulations to refine
the homology models; (c) preparation of and docking the Type II inhibitors
into the active sites of an ensemble of the refined homology models
of the Mnk1/2 kinases; (d) MD simulations of the complexes; (e) binding
energy calculations; and (f) hydration analysis. The protocols used
for sections (a–e) were the same as outlined in our earlier
work on the binding of the Type I inhibitors to the catalytic domains
of the Mnk1/2 kinases15 except that the
template used for the homology models in the present study was the
crystal structure of the inactive form of the Calmodulin-domain protein
kinase 1 (PDB code 2WEI).19 We additionally used the structures
of Mnk1 in its autoinhibited states (PDB ID id 2HW6),13 excluding the activation loop (because it occludes the
binding pocket) and the structure of a mutant Mnk2 kinase which has
been crystallized in the inactive form (PDB id 2AC3)14 but is missing the activation loop; details of the methods
are in the Supporting Information. We now
outline the analysis of the roles of water molecules.

Selection of
Interface Water Molecules
We investigated
the effects of water molecules that stabilize the interactions between
the kinases and the inhibitors. Each conformation sampled during the
MD simulation was mined to identify water molecules (oxygens) that
were located within 3.5 Å of a kinase or inhibitor atom (nonhydrogen).
These water molecules were considered to be part of the kinase structure
during subsequent calculations of the binding free energies, using
the MMPBSA method.33−35 We also investigated the effects of varying the numbers
of water molecules included in each conformation sampled (1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 10, and 20 waters).
