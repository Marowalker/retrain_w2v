Vapor–liquid
equilibrium (VLE) data are measured and reported for the LiCl + CaCl2 + H2O system. The experimental procedures were
carried out with pressures between 6 and 101.3 kPa in a computer-controlled
glass apparatus. We obtained the relationship between solubility of
salt and vapor pressure by analyzing and summarizing the results.
Then, a modified NRTL model based on the hypothesis of hydration was
used in this paper. By correlation of literature and experimental
data for LiCl + H2O, CaCl2 + H2O,
and LiCl + CaCl2 + H2O (pressure spanning from
5 to 101.3 kPa), some parameters were modified for improving the accuracy
of the calculation. Meanwhile, the model was successfully applied
to predict the VLE data in LiCl + CaCl2 + H2O systems with the modified binary parameters.

1 Introduction
Crystallization,
separation, and purification of electrolyte solutions
are the key roles in technology and industrial fields. Vapor–liquid
equilibrium (VLE) is widely used in chemical engineering and industries,
which plays a fundamental role in chemical engineering.

Massive
amounts of data with respect to phase equilibrium are reported in
recent years, whereas corresponding thermodynamic models have been
developed to calculate thermodynamic properties for electrolyte and
nonelectrolyte systems. Because of the strong demand for separation
process design, more researchers studied VLE on electrolyte systems.
However, most of data were concentrated in normal pressure (101.3
kPa) and room temperature (298.15 K). Up to now, some solubility isotherms
of LiCl + CaCl2 + H2O system have been measured,1−4 whereas
VLE of LiCl + H2O and CaCl2 + H2O
binary systems has been obtained.5 Nevertheless,
VLE data for systems composed of LiCl + CaCl2 + H2O are still rare. For nonelectrolyte solutions, thermodynamic models
such Wilson’s model,6 NRTL model,7 and UNIQUAC model8 are well established. For thermodynamic property calculation of
electrolyte solutions, Pitzer’s model,9 ElecNRTL model,10,11 Lu–Maurer’s model,12,13 extended UNIQUAC model,14 and Xu’s
model15 have been widely utilized. In recent
years, some scholars18−20 have
done some research on the electrolyte solution systems. Despite the
aforementioned research works, the calculation of VLE for mixed electrolyte
systems is still confronted with great challenges.

In this paper,
VLE data of the system composed of LiCl + CaCl2 + H2O are elaborately determined with a pressure varying from
10 to 101.3 kPa. The obtained data in binary systems5,15 are used to parameterize the modified NRTL model. By this means,
a complete VLE diagram of the LiCl + CaCl2 + H2O system at various pressures and model parameters is obtained.

2 Model Description
2.1 Xu’s Model
In
Xu’s model,5,15 the excess Gibbs energy was expressed
by the NRTL term7 1   2   3   4  where n is the number
of species of solute in electrolyte solution, mx is the total molality of solute, mi is the molality of solute, mw is the
molar of free water, hi is the hydration
numbers of the solute, nt is the molar
of solute and solvent, and Ms is the molecular
weight of water.

τw,x and τx,w are the water-entity term and the entity-water term, respectively: 5   6  

The
relations between parameters τw,i, τi,w, and the temperature T are as follows: 7   8  Based on the above descriptions, the final equation can be written
as: 9  The reference state
of activity coefficients in the excess Gibbs energy model is γi → 1 as xi = (ni/nt) → 1. In the final
equations, five parameters (h, τw,i(0), τw,i(1), τi,w(0), and τi,w(1)) were fitted
to the experimental data.

Then, the thermodynamic model was studied, and Xu’s model
was employed to correlate and predict VLE for the system. Xu’s
model, ElecNRTL model,10,11 and Pitzer’s model9 were used to correlate VLE data in electrolyte
systems, and VLE behaviors of LiCl + CaCl2 + H2O were investigated.

3.1 Discussion of Experimental Results
LiCl + H2O,
CaCl2 + H2O, and LiCl + CaCl2 + H2O systems were chosen to study the VLE law, as shown in Tables 2–4 and Figures 4–6. From the tables and figures,
we can see that the VLE law of LiCl + H2O, CaCl2 + H2O, and LiCl + CaCl2 + H2O is
similar. For LiCl + H2O and CaCl2 + H2O systems, as the salt concentration increases, the saturated vapor
pressure of water decreases regularly. From the results, we can see
that as the temperature increases, the saturated vapor pressure also
rises regularly. From Tables 2–4 and Figure 4, we can see that as the VLE pressure of mLiCl = 2.43 mol/kg and mCaCl2 = 7.08 mol/kg in the LiCl + CaCl2 + H2O system is lowest, the activity at the same temperature is
lowest, and as the VLE pressure of mLiCl = 15.63 mol/kg and mCaCl2 = 1.30 mol/kg
in LiCl + CaCl2 + H2O system is highest, the
activity at the same temperature is highest. Simultaneously, the CaCl2 + H2O curve at saturated solubility and normal
temperature is lower than LiCl + H2O.

From the analysis
of results, we can see that the hygroscopicity at some mixed concentration
is also relatively strong, and we can calculate the strongest concentration
of moisture absorption by modeling.

3.2 Results of the Modeling
3.2.1 Correlation of the VLE
The model
described above was used to correlate VLE data for the LiCl + CaCl2 + H2O system. The results of correlation for LiCl
+ H2O, CaCl2 + H2O, and LiCl + CaCl2 + H2O systems are listed in Table 5 and Figure 5 in the form of mean deviation between literature and
calculated values. Parameters τ1,20, τ2,10, τ1,30, τ3,10, τ2,30, τ3,20, τ1,21, τ2,11, τ1,31, τ3,11, τ2,31, τ3,21, h1, and h2 were obtained from the correlation of the
experimental and literature data, as listed in Table 6. For LiCl + CaCl2 + H2O, it can be seen from Table 4 that dY = 0.27 kPa and dP = 1.03%. dY and dP were calculated
via the following equations 10   11  where N denotes the number of data
points and Pexp and Pcal denote the experimental vapor pressure and the calculated
vapor pressure, respectively.

3.2.2 Prediction of the VLE
Xu’s model was chosen
to predict the VLE results, as shown in Figure 6, as well as dY = 6.8 kPa
and dP = 11.31%. The parameters in Xu’s model
were obtained from literature,15 as listed
in Table 7. It is clear
that Xu’s model can be used to describe the VLE law of the
ternary electrolyte systems. However, the prediction result is worse
than the correlation result.

in Xu’s Model
system	model type	a	h	τi,w(0)	τw,i(0)	τi,w(1)	τw,i(1)	
CaCl2-H2O	original	0.3	1.1	–4.66	36.94	–114.25	–13200.53	
LiCl-H2O	original	2.15	–0.957	2.06	–822.12	–93.41

LiCl-H2O	modified	2.15	–4.99	13.17	–4.29	16.17	
For the LiCl + CaCl2 + H2O system, the prediction result is unsatisfactory.
We have recalculated the parameters for LiCl + H2O and
CaCl2 + H2O systems by using the experimental
data in this work and modified the parameters for the binary electrolyte
solutions, as listed in Table 7. Prediction results for the LiCl + CaCl2 + H2O system used the modified parameters are dY = 0.37 kPa and dP = 1.76%. The prediction with
modified parameters is considered more accurate. However, the prediction
results are not better than the correlation results (dY = 0.27 kPa and dP = 1.03%). If you want to calculate
the VLE data more accurately, you can use the correlated model. The
predicted model is relatively simple and convenient.

3.3 Comparison with Other Methods
The LiCl + CaCl2 + H2O system was selected
for comparing ElecNRTL model, Pitzer’s model, and Xu’s
model. Comparison results are shown in Table 8. Note that both ElecNRTL and Pitzer results
were calculated by the software Aspen Plus 8.1.

For the LiCl
+ CaCl2 + H2O system, the dY value (0.27 kPa) of this work (correlation) used Xu’s model
is smaller than that of ElecNRTL’s model (dY = 0.45 kPa) and Pitzer’s model (dY = 0.3
kPa). Besides, the dP value (1.03%) of this work
(correlation) used Xu’s model is smaller than that of ElecNRTL’s
model (dP = 2.3% ) and Pitzer’s model (dP = 1.72%).

A modified NRTL model based on the hypothesis
of hydration was proposed in Xu’s work. Xu’s model for
the excess Gibbs energy was derived from the NRTL equation, and the
hydration hypothesis and the salt–salt mixing rule were introduced
in the model. Because of the assumptions and theoretical derivations,
the results in this work are considered more comprehensive and accurate.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, VLE data for LiCl + CaCl2 + H2O systems was measured and reported. The reliability of measurements
was verified by comparing experimental data with literatures. Through
the analysis of experimental data, it is shown that the solubility
of salt is an important factor affecting saturated vapor pressure.
As the VLE pressure of mLiCl = 2.43 mol/kg
and mCaCl2 = 7.08 mol/kg is lowest, the
activity at the same temperature is lowest, and the hygroscopicity
at some mixed concentration is also relatively strong.

By the
correlation of experimental data, modified parameters (LiCl-H2O and CaCl2-H2O) of Xu’s model
were obtained. The calculations were compared to ElecNRTL model and
Pitzer’s model. From comparisons, the result in this work is
better than ElecNRTL model and Pitzer’s model. The model can
be used to successfully predict VLE data for the LiCl + CaCl2 + H2O system with modified binary parameters.

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Materials
Anhydrous LiCl
(purity ≥99.9%) and anhydrous CaCl2 (purity ≥99.99%)
were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. Distilled water
(18.2 Ω·cm) was used for the preparation of solutions.

5.2 Apparatus and Procedures
A dual circulation glass ebulliometer (40 mL) was used in the VLE
measurements, as shown in Figure 1. The main experimental instruments are listed in Table 1, including a vacuum
pump in the ebulliometer, a pressure controller, a heating mantle,
and a temperature controller.

During the experiments, the sample
was placed into the glass ebulliometer, then heated by the heating
mantle, and was controlled by the temperature controller. The operation
pressure was controlled by the vacuum pump, the pressure sensor, and
the control valve. The procedures were carried out with a pressure
between 6.3 and 101.3 kPa. The vapor sample was condensed in a spherical
condenser (length 40 cm) and then returned to the mixing chamber for
recirculation.

The experimental steps are as follows: (1) First,
we need to check the airtightness of the entire system by controlling
the pressure. (2) We need to calibrate the temperature and pressure
detectors. (3) The sample (40 mL) is placed into the glass ebulliometer.
(4) The temperature heater is turned on, and the temperature is set
by the temperature controller (110–180 V). (5) The vacuum pump
is turned on, and the pressure is controlled by an electronic pressure
relief valve. (6) The time was 0.5–1 h in the first equilibrium;
then, the following equilibrium time was 10–20 min. (7) When
the VLE state is reached, we recorded the temperature and pressure
values.

The reliability of measurement was verified by comparing
our experimental data (i.e., H2O + CaCl2, NaCl-KCl-H2O) with those in literatures (Figures 2 and 3). We have verified
the accuracy and stability of the equipment by using the VLE data
of the H2O + CaCl2 system in ref (5). The experimental data
for LiCl + CaCl2 + H2O systems at different
molality are listed in Tables 2–4.
