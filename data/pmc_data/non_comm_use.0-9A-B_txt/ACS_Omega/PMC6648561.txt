A series
of isomeric boronated acridinium dyes were obtained by
reactions of 10-(4′-octyloxyphenyl) functionalized 9(10H)-acridanone derivative with lithiated phenylboronic azaesters
followed by aromatization with perchloric acid. The effect of the
position of boronic group attached at ortho, meta, and para positions
of the 9-phenyl ring on the photophysical properties was investigated.
Conversion to related betaine trifluoroborato-substituted compounds
was successfully performed, and the effect of this structural change
on UV–vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy characteristics
was established. Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry studies revealed
that electrochemical behavior of cationic versus betaine structures
is different in terms of redox potential values as well as stability.
The theoretical calculations revealed a different scheme for molecular
excitation processes in B(OH)2 versus BF3–-substituted compounds as charge transfer to acridinium
core is observed from N-aryl or B-aryl moiety, respectively. Obtained compounds were active as photocatalysts
in selected visible-light-promoted addition reactions to unsaturated
substrates.

Introduction
Recently, a continuous
interest in various types of acridine dyes
is observed because of their interesting photophysical properties
and biological activity. Various synthetic approaches to these compounds
were developed, and many natural products possessing the acridine
scaffold were isolated.1,2 Basic research concerning acridinium
dyes was mostly aimed at characterization of charge-transfer processes
in those compounds during electron excitation.3−11 From the practical point of view, significant efforts have been
devoted to utilizing acridine dyes as sensor materials for detection
of anions12−15 as well as for biolabeling purposes.16−18 There is also an increased
interest in their use as components for the construction of organic
light-emitting diodes (LEDs)19−22 and solar cells.23 Furthermore,
selected derivatives exhibit potent chemiluminescence, making them
useful in clinical diagnostics.24−26 Among various compounds comprising
acridine scaffold, cationic acridinium dyes feature the reactive 9-position
which has been exploited in designing dynamic supramolecular systems27,28 as well as for pseudobase formation.29,30 Recently,
photocatalytic properties of selected acridinium dyes with a special
emphasis on 9-mesitylacridinium derivatives were discovered. Since
then, numerous reports on the use of these compounds in visible-light
induced organic transformations were published, especially by the
groups of Fukuzumi and Nicewicz.31−49 In this contribution, we describe two series of regioisomeric acridinium
dyes bearing the neutral or the anionic boron-based groups, B(OH)2 and BF3–, respectively. Our
study was aimed at evaluation of the effect of boron substituent variation
on the photophysical properties. Specifically, we have raised a specific
issue of charge distribution or, more precisely, separation of the
positive charge of the organic cation from the negative charge of
an anionic entity. In addition, photocatalytic activity of obtained
compounds in selected reactions was tested.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
Following the reported procedures,19,41 in the first
step, 9(10H)-acridanone was subjected
to Cu(I)-catalyzed N-arylation with 1-iodo-4-octyloxybenzene50 to give compound 4 in high yield
(Scheme 1). The n-octyloxy chain was introduced to improve the solubility
of the intermediate ketone 4 as well as final acridinium
products 5–10. Reactions of 2-(halophenyl)-6-butyl[1,3,6,2]dioxazaborocans 1–3(51) with n-BuLi were performed by addition of a tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution
of 1–3 to a precooled (−80 °C, internal
temperature) solution of n-BuLi in THF (ca. 0.6 M).
The mixture needed to be stirred for 30 min at ca. −75 °C
to complete the interconversion. The resultant lithiated arylboronate
intermediates are sufficiently stable under these conditions; however,
slow decomposition was observed to some extent above −70 °C,
resulting in lower product yields. Subsequent addition of a solution
of 4 in THF followed by hydrolysis gave respective carbinols
which were converted to targeted acridinium salts 5–7 by addition of 70 wt % HClO4 (Scheme 2). The products were isolated in good yields
as bright yellow (5 and 7) or pale-orange
(6) powders well soluble in polar organic solvents and
insoluble in water. The synthesis of zwitterionic trifluoroborato
derivatives was accomplished by mixing compounds 5–7 in acetone with excess of aqueous KHF2 followed by evaporation
of a resulting mixture and extraction of a product 8–10 with acetone (Scheme 3). Compounds 5–10 were fully characterized by
multinuclear (1H, 13C, 11B, 19F) NMR spectroscopy. The presence of B(OH)2 group
in 5–7 was directly confirmed by the 11B NMR spectra showing broad resonances at ca. 28 ppm. In the case
of 8–10, broad 11B NMR signals were
found in the range of 3–9 ppm, whereas 19F NMR spectra
showed resonances at ca. −140 ppm in agreement with values
reported for various organotrifluoroborates.52

Derivatives 8–10
In addition, the structure of 9 was confirmed
by X-ray
diffraction (Figure 1a). The molecular conformation resembles that found for related acridinium
derivatives showing that both benzene rings are oriented almost perpendicularly
with respect to the acridinium core. The dihedral angles between acridinium
moiety and phenyl rings bearing octyloxy and trifluoroborato functionalities
are equal to 87.80(1) and 78.00(1), respectively. The supramolecular
organization is mostly defined by the electrostatic interactions between
BF3– and central positively charged acridinium
ring. Each trifluoroborato moiety is sandwiched between two such rings
(Figure 1c). Because
of the perpendicular alignment of aromatic rings, the structure expands
into a three-dimensional network (Figure 1b).

level) and (b)
supramolecular structure of 9. (c) Intermolecular contacts
between BF3– group and acridinium core
are additionally depicted.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that compounds 5–10 are quite stable up to 250–300 °C
(for details, see the Supporting Information, Figures S37–S42). A small yet detectable mass loss of ca.
2–3% was observed for 5–8 at lower temperatures
(ca. 120–160 °C) corresponding to melting points of these
compounds [confirmed by endothermic peaks in the respective differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves]. This can be due to the escape
of residual solvents including water released during dehydration of
boronic groups in 5–7. At higher temperatures
(above 250 °C), exothermic degradation processes occur. They
are accompanied by the mass loss of ca. 25–30% for perchlorate
salts 5–7 and 35–70% for betaine-type dyes 8–10.

Electrochemical Properties
The electrochemical
properties
of 5–10 were studied using cyclic voltammetry
(CV) measurements in dichloromethane (DCM) with respect to the Fc/Fc+ redox couple (Figure 2) and reported with respect to saturated calomel electrode
(SCE) (Table 1) for
a direct comparison with data reported for analogous acridinium derivatives.43 For irreversible redox processes, the oxidation
and reduction half-potentials (Eox1/2, Ered1/2) were estimated
based on the onset values. In the remaining cases, they were calculated
as the mean value of anodic and cathodic peak potentials. Compound 5 displays reversible oxidation at 1.15 V. Unlike 5, its regioisomers 6 and 7 show quasireversible
oxidation processes which indicates that oxidation is followed by
chemical reactions. For betaine-type compounds 8–10, the oxidation is fully irreversible which is in line with the increased
reactivity of the C–BF3– bond
because of its relatively stronger nucleophilic character with respect
to compounds bearing B(OH)2 functionality. The reduction
potentials for 5–7 span in a rather narrow range
from −0.58 to −0.67 V and are slightly lower than those
found for commonly used 9-mesitylacridinium photocatalysts.43 Neutral (zwitterionic) compounds 8–10 have their ground-state reduction potentials negatively shifted
in comparison to 5–7. The most negative value
of Ered1/2 = −0.97 eV
was observed for the ortho-BF3– derivative 10 and it is even lower than that reported
recently for a compound bearing strongly electron-donating methoxy
groups attached to the acridinium core (Ered1/2 = −0.84 eV).43 On
the basis of the oxidation and reduction potentials, molecular orbital
levels were established and energy gap values were estimated (Table 1). For betaine-type
compounds 8–10, they are higher than those obtained
for their respective cationic precursors. It should be noted that
the biggest difference of 0.57 eV is between band gaps for ortho-substituted
derivatives 7 (2.18 eV) and 10 (2.75 eV),
which indicates that the electronic properties of the acridinium system
are influenced due to some specific interaction between acridinium
ring and boron-based functional groups.

Photophysical Properties of 5–10
The
optical properties of 5–10 were investigated
by UV–vis absorption in solution under ambient conditions.
To study solvatochromic phenomena, measurements were performed in
three solvents differing in polarity—DCM, acetonitrile, and
toluene (Figure 3, Table 2). Additional spectra
and overlays are presented in the Supporting Information (Figures S19–S30). UV–vis absorption spectra of all
compounds show three distinct bands at ca. 435, 360, and 345 nm in
DCM, in agreement with data for analogous compounds.53 In addition, the longest wavelength absorption band at
ca. 435 nm exhibits a characteristic fine structure featuring two
side bands of a lower intensity. The molar absorption coefficients
of 5–10 range from ε = 8780 to 12 700
M–1 cm–1, which is considerably
higher than the value reported for the related 9-mesityl-10-methylacridinium
perchlorate (ε = 5600 M–1 cm–1).53 Structural changes and the kind of
solvent do not strongly influence the positions of absorption bands
for compounds 5–7. For betaine structures 8–10, the slight blue shift (up to 11 nm) was observed
with increased solvent polarity (when DCM was replaced with acetonitrile).
One can also clearly see that the position of BF3– is also important as the blue shift of 16 nm (in DCM) is observed
when going from para to ortho isomer.

a Samples
in DCM were excited at the
absorption maximum at the longest wavelength and all samples in toluene
were excited at 433 nm; standard: coumarine 153 in EtOH, c = 4 × 10–6 M, RT, QY = 0.544).54 Δ denotes the Stokes shift.

b Spectra of 8 were not measured due
to lack of solubility in toluene.

Some distinct features can be noted when analyzing
emission spectra
of 5–10. In DCM a slight blue shift of 12 nm is
observed when changing the location of the B(OH)2 group
from para to ortho position. In turn, a stronger blue shift of 21
nm can be observed when moving of BF3– group from para to ortho position. This indicates that the emission
properties of betaine structures 8–10 are more
sensitive to the change of the position of the boron-based groups
than one observes in their cationic counterparts 5–7. A significant solvatochromism was observed for 5 where
the bathochromic shift of the emission band occurs in DCM solution
(λem = 544 nm vs 518 nm in toluene). The analogous
red shift was detected also for 6 and 7, but it was much weaker (14 and 8 nm, respectively). In contrast,
data obtained for 9–10 (compound 8 was completely insoluble in toluene) indicate lack of solvatochromism
for betaine-type structures. Overall, the emission spectra show one
broad band and only in case of 9 and 10 the
fine structure was observed. All analyzed compounds exhibited rather
weak emission as the highest quantum yield (QY) of 0.034 was determined
for 9. This is in agreement with literature data which
indicate that introduction of 9-aryl group to the acridinium system
results in strong quenching of fluorescence.

Theoretical Calculations
Theoretical calculations performed
at PBE0/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory revealed that the mechanism responsible
for the electron transition is different for cationic and zwitterionic
derivatives (Figure 4). To simplify the calculations, the long octyloxy chain was replaced
with the ethoxy group in all studied structures. According to expectations,
in all systems, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) orbital
is located on the central acridinium core. In the case of compounds 5 and 7 three highest occupied molecular orbitals
(HOMOs, almost degenerate) are confined on the ClO4– anion; however, the time-dependent density functional
theory (TD-DFT) calculations show that corresponding electron transitions
are not effective (Figure 5). Instead, values of ground-state oscillator strengths suggest
that the excitation occurs from the HOMO – 3 and HOMO –
4 orbitals located on the electron rich alkoxy-substituted N-aryl ring (NPh). For compound 6, the hydrogen-bond
interaction between B(OH)2 and ClO4– entities stabilizes orbital levels located on the ClO4– anion, thus changing the order of HOMO levels.
Besides, the excitation mechanism operating in this system remains
unchanged, that is, the charge transfer occurs from the N-aryl moiety to the acridinium core. This goes in line with the calculated
absorption maxima, which are in agreement with experimental values.
A different scheme for electron excitation is observed for 8–10 where the HOMO spans across the BF3–-aryl moiety or is additionally spread on acridinium core. The energies
of molecular orbitals located on the N-aryl moiety
are lower and, according to TD-DFT calculations, they do not contribute
to an excitation process. Consequently, in 8–10 the electric density flows from BF3–-substituted phenyl ring to the acridinium core, although the contribution
of π–π* excitation on the acridinium ring is also
important. The calculated values of absorption maxima are close to
experimental ones (they are usually lower by about 20 nm). It is also
noticeable that the LUMO level of 10 is elevated with
respect to regioisomers 8 and 9. This is
in agreement with the results obtained from CV measurements.

molecular orbitals mostly responsible for the electron
excitation in 5 and 8. Blue and red areas

4 to LUMO molecular
orbitals (eV) for 5–10 derived from DFT calculations.
The locations of molecular orbitals are represented by the colors
according to the given molecular schemes. The orbitals that do not
take part in the excitation process are marked in gray.

Regarding the emission characteristics, the calculations
underestimate
the experimental wavelengths, except for para-substituted derivatives 5 and 8. At this point, it should be noted that
calculations were performed for an isolated molecule but the interaction
with solvent molecules of such a species with strong charge separation
may significantly affect the energy levels and excitation processes.
Furthermore, the transition to triplet state can also be expected.55−57 The fluorescent QYs were also small, suggesting the nonradiative
decay of excited states.

Observed differences can be rationalized
in terms of different
molecular geometries and charge distribution. In contrast to 5–7, the acridinium and (trifluoroborato)phenyl moieties
in 8–10 are not aligned in a perpendicular fashion
as the angle between corresponding mean square planes are 52.7°
(8), 54.0° (9) and 75.4° (10). This should facilitate the charge transfer between BF3––aryl group and acridinium core.
Furthermore, the alternation between the neutral boronic group (being
a weak electron-acceptor) and the anionic trifluoroborato group (a
strong electron-donor) results in differentiation of the charge distribution
within the acridinium and the phenyl ring attached at C-9 (Figure 6, Table S3 in Supporting Information). In all studied systems,
the N-aryl group is negatively charged (−0.1
to −0.3 e) and remains almost unaffected by the type and position
of boron-based group. The positive charge of a central acridinium
ring in 5–7 (1.2–1.4 e) is larger than
that in 8–10 (+0.8 to 1.1 e), while BF3––aryl group bear significant negative charge
of about −0.7 e. Furthermore, the C9 carbon atom of acridinium
core becomes significantly less electrophilic in zwitterionic compounds 8–10 as indicated by its strongly reduced positive
charge (+0.36 vs +1.20 e for 8 and 5, respectively).
In turn, the neighbored carbon atom from BF3––aryl ring is more electropositive (+1.38 e vs +0.78 e for 8 and 5, respectively). It is also important
to note that magnitude and orientation of dipole moment are different
for both classes of boronated acridines. In 5, it is
equal to 11.8 D (μ = 12.1 D in 6, μ = 13.1
D in 7) and points perpendicularly to acridine moiety
from the ClO4– anion. Naturally, the
vector orientation would be strongly affected by the position of the
ClO4– counterion; however, we suppose
that in weakly coordinative solvents such as DCM or toluene, contact
ion pairs resembling the optimized geometries are highly expected.
This is in accordance with UV–vis spectroscopic studies showing
that the position of absorption and emission bands are only slightly
affected by solvent polarity. In turn, zwitterions 8–10 are highly polar (μ = 30.1 D for 8, μ =
25.7 D for 9, μ = 14.2 D for 10) with
dipole moment vectors roughly pointing from (trifluoroborato)phenyl
to N-aryl groups.

provided in Tables
S2 and S3 in the Supporting Information. The vector of dipole moment is additionally depicted (blue arrow).

Photocatalytic Activity
Preliminary results concerning
photocatalytic activity of 5–10 were obtained.
We have found that these compounds catalyze the visible light-mediated
atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) of 1-iodoperfluorobutane to
ethynyl MIDA-boronate (Scheme 4).58 The reaction afforded functionalized
vinyl MIDA-boronate 11 as the mixture of two different
isomers (E/Z = 0.35/1) in 45% yield
for 5–9 and 55% for 10. The catalytic
cycle involves oxidation of sodium ascorbate by the excited catalyst
followed by reduction of C4F9I. As the compounds 5–10 are rather moderate reductants, their ability
to reduce C4F9I (Ered1/2 < −1.0 V vs SCE)59 is surprising based on the electron transfer mechanism. However,
the incompatibility of the redox potentials has been observed earlier
in some reactions catalyzed by [Acr+-Mes]ClO4 (Ered1/2 = −0.5 V
vs SCE).44 For example, in the aerobic
oxidation of benzyl alcohols60 the key
step involves the reaction of benzylic radical with superoxide O2•– generated upon reduction of the
molecular oxygen (Ered1/2 =
−0.87 V vs SCE).61

Scheme 4 Iodoperfluorobutylation
of Ethynyl MIDA-Boronate Catalyzed by 5–10
Next, we tried to check the
oxidation potential of our acridinium
dyes. We decided to use the protocol developed by Koike and Akita,62 where the alkyl radicals generated via oxidation
of alkyltrifluoroborates by the excited [Acr+-Mes]ClO4 reacted with electron deficient alkenes. However, for 5–7 and 10, the reaction of potassium
cyclobutyltrifluoroborate with diethyl ethylidenemalonate did not
proceed at all which can be ascribed to lower excited-state reduction
potentials E1/2(M*/M–) for 5–10 (they range from 1.68 to 2.04 V, see Table 3) with respect to
[Acr+-Mes]ClO4 (2.08 V).43 However, the reaction afforded compound 12 because of the formal addition of methanol to the double bond (Scheme 5). The best conversion
(76%) was observed for compound 7 bearing the B(OH)2 group at the ortho position. The control experiment in the
absence of light did not afford 12, suggesting that a
photoactivated catalyst is involved in the reaction; however, mechanism
of the reaction is not clear and will be the subject of further studies
in our group.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a series of three isomeric boronated acridinium
perchlorate salts and their zwitterionic trifluoroborato counterparts
have been prepared and comprehensively characterized. UV–vis
absorption and fluorescence maxima of these compounds depend markedly
on both the position and the kind of boron substituent. In general,
the red shift is observed when moving the boron substituent from ortho
to para position of the boronated phenyl ring. Also, the electrochemical
behavior is attenuated by the total charge of the entire acridinium
system, as CV measurements revealed that the ground state potentials E1/2(M+/M) and E1/2(M/M–) are significantly lower for zwitterionic
derivatives 8–10. Furthermore, TD-DFT calculations
revealed a strong impact of the structure and position of the boron-based
group on the photophysical characteristics of studied systems which
is especially manifested by varying nature of electron excitation
processes. From the practical point of view, it is important that
obtained compounds proved to be effective organic photocatalysts in
selected addition reactions to substrates bearing double and triple
carbon–carbon bonds. Further work will be undertaken to disclose
new visible light photocatalytic protocols whose specificity will
rely on the use of obtained boronated acridinium dyes.

Experimental
Section
General Comments
All reactions involving air- and moisture-sensitive
reagents were carried out under an argon atmosphere. Solvents were
stored over sodium wire before use. Key reagents including arylboronic
acids, BDEA, and n-butyllithium (10 M solution in
hexanes) were purchased from Aldrich and used as received. The NMR
chemical shifts are given relative to tetramethylsilane using known
chemical shifts of residual proton (1H) or carbon (13C) solvent resonances. 11B and 19F
NMR chemical shifts are given relative to BF3·Et2O and CFCl3, respectively. In the 13C NMR spectra, the resonances of carbon atoms bound to boron were
not observed because of their broadening by quadrupolar boron nucleus.

Cyclic Voltammetry
CV measurements
were carried out
in a dry argon atmosphere using a VMP3 potentiostat (Bio-Logic) with
a scan rate 0.1 V·s–1. The solutions of studied
compounds (1 mM) in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6/CH2Cl2 were prepared inside the argon-filled glovebox and
then measured in a three-electrode electrochemical cell: a gold working
electrode (ALS Co. Ltd.; 2 mm2), a counter electrode (platinum
wire), and an Ag/Ag+ reference electrode (silver wire in
0.1 M AgNO3/AN). The potential of the reference electrode
versus the ferrocene redox couple was checked before and after experiments.

X-ray Structural Measurements and Refinement Details
The

of acetone solution. It was measured at 100 K on a SuperNova diffractometer
equipped with a Atlas detector (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.54184
Å). Data reduction and analysis were carried out with the CrysAlisPro
program.63 All structures were solved by
direct methods using SHELXS-9764 and refined
using SHELXL-2014.65 Crystallographic information

Optical Properties
The UV–vis absorption spectra
were recorded using a Hitachi UV-2300II spectrometer. The emission
spectra were recorded using a Hitachi F-7000 spectrofluorometer, equipped
with a photomultiplier detector, calibrated using Spectral Fluorescence
Standard Kit certified by BAM Federal Institute for Materials Research
and Testing.66 The measurements were performed
at room temperature, according to published procedures.67,68 Suprasil quartz cuvettes (10.00 mm) were used. 1.5 nm slits were
used for absorption and 2.5 nm slits were used for emission spectra.
To eliminate any background emission, the spectrum of a pure solvent
was subtracted from the samples’ spectra. QY were determined
in diluted solutions (A < 0.1 for longest wavelength
band) by comparison with known standard—coumarin 153 in ethanol
(c = 4 × 10–6 mol·dm–3, QY = 0.544).66 Concentration
of complexes solutions were in the range of 1–2 × 10–5 M (concentration was adjusted to reach similar absorbance
to absorbance of reference solution at the excitation wavelength).
To calculate the QY the following formula was used  where F is the relative integrated
photon flux of sample (x) and standard (st), A is
the absorbance at the excitation wavelength, and n is the refractive index of used solvents.  Photon fluxes (F) were calculated
by integration of corrected spectra (Ic), obtained by division of intensity of emission spectra (I) by the spectral responsivity (s) at
corresponding wavelengths (λem). All measurements
were carried out at room temperature.

Theoretical Calculations
The single-molecule optimizations
were performed for all conformers of 1 and 2 at the PBE0/6-311+G(d,p)69−71 level of theory. The minima were
confirmed by vibrational frequency calculations within harmonic approximation
(no imaginary frequencies). During the calculations, no symmetry constraints
were applied. The initial geometry of 9 was extracted
from the crystal structures, and then the OC8H18 group was replaced by OEt group. Such a transformation did not affect
the studied electronic processes but significantly simplified the
calculations. The remaining structures were generated by changing
the substitution pattern. In the case of 5–7,
the ClO4– anion first was placed apart
from the acridinium cation; during the optimization procedure, it
approached close to the cation. The cartesian coordinates for optimized
structures are given in Tables S4–S9 in the Supporting Information. Excited-state geometries, along with
absorption and emission spectra, were obtained using TD-DFT methods
with the same basis set, starting with geometries obtained from ground-state
optimizations.
