Pressure
significantly modifies the microscopic interactions in
the condense phase, leading to new patterns of bonding and unconventional
chemistry. Using unbiased structure searching techniques combined
with first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the reaction of
argon with xenon at a pressure as low as 1.1 GPa, producing a novel
van der Waals compound XeAr2. This compound is a wide-gap
insulator and crystallizes in a MgCu2-type Laves phase
structure. The calculations of phonon spectra and formation enthalpy
indicate that XeAr2 would be stable without any phase transition
or decomposition at least up to 500 GPa.

Introduction
Due to the stable closed-shell electronic
configuration, noble
gas (NG) elements (e.g., He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe) were historically
believed to be chemically unreactive. However, Pauling1 predicted that Xe and Kr may bond to electronegative atoms,
which was proved experimentally by Bartlett2 with the synthesis of the first NG compound XePtF6. This
seminal discovery leaded to a recognized renaissance in NG chemistry
in the past few decades.3−5

Under ambient conditions,
the heavier NG element Xe and, to some
extent, Kr and Ar have been known to be oxidized by halogen and oxygen,
forming halide and oxide compounds, respectively.6−8 Under high pressures,
the reactivity of NGs was drastically altered.

On one hand,
application of high pressure makes NGs easier to be
oxidized; for example, NGs can be oxidized not only by fluorine9−12 and oxygen13−16 but also by nitrogen17 and sulfur,18 and even metal elements such as iron and nickel.19 Theoretical predictions revealed that Xe reacts
with S and N at 14617 and 191 GPa,18 respectively. Direct reactions of Xe with Fe/Ni
were predicted to occur under the pressures of Earth’s inner
core.19 A subsequent experimental study
reported the synthesis of a Xe–Ni compound at a pressure around
150 GPa.20 Of special attention, the Fe/Ni
atoms in the Xe–Fe/Ni compounds play the role of anions instead
of cations that behave as usual metals. In addition, Xe has also been
observed to react with water ice at pressures above 50 GPa.21 In these NG compounds, Xe bonds to other elements
chemically by sharing its closed-shell electrons. On the contrary,
NG elements can also become oxidants and gain electrons from alkali
and alkaline earth metals such as Li,22 Cs,23 and Mg.24

On the other hand, NGs also form van der Waals (vdW) compounds
under lower pressures wherein the NG atoms do not lose or gain electrons.
For instance, the Laves phase compounds NeHe2,25 Ar(H2)2,26 ArHe2,27 Xe(O2)2,2828 and Xe(N2)229,30 can be synthesized at pressures of a few gigapascals. The stabilities
of such compounds can be explained in terms of packing rules analogous
to binary crystals of hard spherelike particles for intermetallic
compounds. Other classes of vdW compounds have also been discovered.
The structure of (N2)6Ne731 can be viewed as a clathrate with the centers
of the N2 molecules forming distorted dodecahedron cages,
each enclosing 14 Ne atoms. XeHe232 stabilizes at 12 GPa, adopting a hexagonal AlB2-type
structure. Some other stoichiometries such as the Xe–H2O,33 Xe–H2,34−36 and He–H2O37,38 systems have also been
observed. The origin of the stability for these compounds was not
well understood.

In a few cases, unexpected chemistry in Xe–F
compounds stabilized
by covalent Xe–Xe bonding9 and in
the Na2He compound stabilized by long-range Coulomb interactions39 has also been reported recently. It is obvious
that the bonding of NGs in compounds under high pressures exhibits
strong uncertainty, which provides a broad scenario waiting for further
investigation. In this paper, we theoretically explore the phase diagram
and bonding of the Xe–Ar binary system under high pressures.
Our results demonstrate the existence of a Xe–Ar compound with
the stoichiometry of XeAr2.

Results and Discussion
To obtain the most energetically favorable structures for the Xe–Ar
binary system, the stoichiometries of XeArn (n = 1–8) containing up to 4 formula units
(fu) per simulation cell are systematically searched under pressures
of 0, 100, 200, and 500 GPa. The calculated formation enthalpies (Hf) of each stoichiometry at different pressures
are shown in the form of convex hulls as depicted in Figure 1. From this figure, the thermodynamic
stability of XeArn can be determined.
The results indicate that each stoichiometry of XeArn has a small positive Hf at 0 GPa.
As the pressure increases to 100, 200, or 500 GPa, the convex hulls
are dominated by a well-developed minimum at XeAr2 stoichiometry,
indicating that only XeAr2 is stable against decomposition
into elemental Xe and Ar. The other stoichiometries are thermodynamically
unstable due to the fact that the increase of pressure would promote
their formation enthalpies to be larger positive values.

pressures. Solid lines denote the convex hull, where the data points
located on represent stable species against any type of decomposition.

with (Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) + D2) and without
(PBE) vdW corrections.

The stable XeAr2 compound is predicted to crystallize
in the MgCu2-type Laves phase structure (Figure 2a), wherein the Xe atoms occupy
the Mg (8a) sites, forming a diamond-type sublattice, and the Ar atoms
reside in the voids of the Xe framework, occupying the Cu (16d) sites.
At 100 GPa, the lattice parameter of XeAr2 is 7.08 Å
in the unit cell. By representing its constituents as hard spheres,
the stability of AB2-type Laves phase can be understand
by the packing rule, i.e., a hard-sphere radius ratio RA/RB close to 1.25 will achieve
the maximum packing efficiency (0.71%) when crystallized in Laves
phase.40 The ratio RA/RB of XeAr2 is 1.13,
which is close to the ideal value of a Laves phase. Our structural
search simulations reveal that the increase of pressure will further
stabilize the Laves phase XeAr2, instead of any phase transition
or decomposition, which is in sharp distinction with other NG compounds
such as XeHe2,32 NeHe2,27 and ArHe2.27

function (ELF) of XeAr2 at 500 GPa.

The inset of Figure 1 shows the pressure-dependent formation enthalpy of MgCu2-type XeAr2 wherein it is shown that XeAr2 becomes
stable at 1.1 GPa. The effect of vdW interactions on the stability
of XeAr2 is also calculated by using the PBE-D2 method.41 The results indicate that the stable pressure
shift to 2.6 GPa with the inclusion of vdW corrections. To determine
the dynamical stability of MgCu2-type XeAr2,
the phonon dispersion spectra are calculated based on the quasi-harmonic
model, and the selected results are shown in Figure 3. It is found that XeAr2 is dynamically
stable without showing any imaginary phonon frequency in the pressure
range from 10 to 500 GPa.

It is known that the Gibbs free energy (G = H – TS) reduces to enthalpy
(H = U + pV) when
temperature
is 0 K. The formation enthalpy of a compound is determined by the
relative internal energy ΔU and pΔV terms with respect to elemental solids. Figure 4 displays the calculated
pressure-dependent ΔU and pΔV of XeAr2. It is shown that the
large gain in negative pΔV term effectively tunes the formation enthalpies to be negative,
although the relative internal energies ΔU are
positive at 0–150 GPa, leading to the reaction of Xe with Ar
above 1.1 GPa. The negative pΔV of XeAr2 is attributed to the smaller volume compared
to the mixing volume of elemental Xe and Ar. For comparison, we also
calculated the pressure-dependent pΔV for MgCu2-type XeS218 and AlB2-type XeHe2.32 As shown in Figure 4, the pressure-dependent pΔV of XeS2 is similar to that of XeAr2, both being negative in the whole pressure region considered. However,
for XeHe2, the values of pΔV are negative under low pressures but positive under high
pressures. This discrepancy leads to different results of stability,
i.e., the MgCu2-type XeS2 and XeAr2 become energetically more favorable under high pressures, whereas
the AlB2-type XeHe2 will decompose when the
pressure increases to 307 GPa.32

of ΔH, ΔU, and pΔV of relevant
compounds.

To study the electronic properties,
we calculate the projected
density of states (PDOS) under high pressures. As shown in Figure 5, XeAr2 is a wide-gap insulator under low pressures. At 10 GPa (Figure 5a), the band gap
is about 8 eV. The states of Ar 3s and 3p and Xe 5s and 5p are highly
localized, suggesting a weak atomic interaction in XeAr2. The calculated pressure-dependent band gaps of XeAr2 in comparison to those of elemental Xe42 are presented in Figure 2b. It is shown that the gap of XeAr2 decreases
more slowly than that of Xe. XeAr2 metallizes at approximately
500 GPa, which is substantially higher than that of Xe (∼130
GPa). At 500 GPa, the PDOS plotted in Figure 5b shows that the electronic states are wildly
broadened, indicating that the relevant valence electrons become more
delocalized. The PDOS also reveal a significant overlap between the
5p states of Xe and 3p states of Ar. Additionally, Bader analysis43 reveals a charge transfer of 0.43 e/atom from
Xe to Ar at 500 GPa (Figure 2c). These features of electronic properties indicate that
strong chemical interactions may exist in XeAr2 under high
pressures.

10 and 500 GPa. (c) Crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) plots
for nearest-neighboring Xe–Ar, Xe–Xe, and Ar–Ar
pairs at 500 GPa.

The fact that both Xe
and Ar possess closed-shell electronic structures
makes them chemically inert at ambient conditions. In the XeAr2 compound, the atoms are bound by vdW forces under low pressures.
At 500 GPa, the nearest-neighbor Xe–Xe, Xe–Ar, and Ar–Ar
distances in XeAr2 are 2.56, 2.45, and 2.09 Å, respectively.
It appears that these atomic distances are close enough for them to
form covalent bonds compared with the proposed covalent radii of Xe
(1.40 Å) and Ar (1.06 Å) atoms.44 To detect the chemical bonding in XeAr2, we calculate
the crystalline orbital Hamiltonian population (COHP) for nearest-neighboring
Xe–Xe, Xe–Ar, and Ar–Ar pairs. As can be seen
from Figure 5c, the
contributions from bonding states are larger than those from antibonding
in the occupied states of the Xe–Xe pair. As a result, the
integrated COHP (ICOHP) up to the Fermi level is −1.20 eV/pair
for bonded Xe–Xe. In the view of crystal orbital Hamilton populations,45 this value suggests a conspicuous contribution
of the Xe–Xe contact to the band energy and always relevant
to covalent bonding. In addition, we also calculate the electron localization
function (ELF).46 As a rule, an ELF value
larger than 0.5 usually corresponds to covalent bonds. However, some
untypical covalent bonds have been found to have lower ELF values.47−49 As displayed in Figure 2d, the obtained ELF value between the nearest Xe atoms in
XeAr2 at 500 GPa is 0.5, which also suggests the possible
presence of covalent Xe–Xe bonds. With regard to the Xe–Ar
pair, the COHP plots show large occupation of the antibonding states
and the ICOHP up to the Fermi level is −0.36, suggesting a
weak atomic bonding. The obtained smaller ELF values (0.32) between
the neighboring Xe–Ar atoms also confirm this. For the neighboring
Ar–Ar pair, the obtained ICOHP is only −0.07, indicating
nonbonding interaction between the relevant atoms.

Conclusions
In summary, we have theoretically explored the stability of XeArn (n = 1–8) under
high pressures up to 500 GPa using the effective CALYPSO structure
searching method combined with first-principles calculations. The
results shown that Xe reacts with Ar at a pressure as low as 1.1 GPa,
producing a MgCu2-type Laves phase XeAr2 compound.
This compound is a wide-gap insulator that would metallize at about
500 GPa. Analysis of the electronic structures and COHP under 500
GPa suggests a possible presence of covalent Xe–Xe bonds in
XeAr2. Our results shed light on the chemical bonding between
NG elements and enrich the NG chemistry.

Computational Details
We perform a systematic structural search for the XeAr binary system
based on a particle swarm optimization methodology as implemented
in the CALYPSO code,50,51 which has been successfully employed
in predicting a large variety of crystal structures.9,17−19,52−58 The underlying total energy calculations and structural relaxations
are carried out within the framework of density functional theory
using the projector augmented wave method59 as implemented in the VASP code.60 We
adopt the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof of generalized gradient
approximation61 to describe the exchange–correlational
functional. The electron-ion interaction is described by pseudopotentials
with 5s25p6 and 3s23p6 as valence electrons for Xe and Ar, respectively. The use of a cutoff
energy of 650 eV and dense enough k-point sampling
grids gives excellent convergence of the calculated enthalpy (<1
meV/atom). The dynamical stability of predicted structures is determined
by phonon calculations using the finite displacement approach as implemented
in the Phonopy code.62 To quantify the
chemical bonding, the crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) is
calculated by using the program Local-Orbital Basis Suite Towards
Electronic-Structure Reconstruction.45,63
