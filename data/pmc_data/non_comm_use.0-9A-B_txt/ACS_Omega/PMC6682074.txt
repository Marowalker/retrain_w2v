The Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
therapeutic research is yielding a large number of potent molecules.
The nanoparticle-based therapeutics against the protein aggregation
in AD is also taking a lead especially with amyloid-β as a primary
target. In this work, we have screened for the first time protein-capped
(PC) metal nanoparticles for their potency in inhibiting Tau aggregation
in vitro. We present a novel function of PC-Fe3O4 and PC-CdS nanoparticles as potent Tau aggregation inhibitors by
fluorescence spectrometry, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis, and electron microscopy. We demonstrate that the
biologically synthesized PC-metal nanoparticles, especially iron oxide
do not affect the viability of neuroblastoma cells. Moreover, PC-CdS
nanoparticles show dual properties of inhibition and disaggregation
of Tau. Thus, the nanoparticles can take a lead as potent Tau aggregation
inhibitors and can be modified for specific drug delivery due to their
very small size. The current work presents unprecedented strategy
to design anti-Tau aggregation drugs, which provides interesting insights
to understand the role of biological nanostructures in Alzheimer’s
disease.

Introduction
Protein misfolding
and accumulation is a hallmark of various diseases, including neurodegenerative
diseases like Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s
disease, Huntington’s disease, etc.1,2 The
pathological cascades as well as the proteins involved in them vary
according to the diseases. For example, the pathological cascade of
Alzheimer’s disease involves the aggregation and accumulation
of two aggregation-prone proteins, amyloid-β and Tau.3,4 Amyloid-β (Aβ1-42) is an amyloidogenic
peptide secreted by the neurons in response to faulty processing of
the membrane-bound amyloid precursor protein by the enzymes β
and γ secretases. This sticky peptide then accumulates and forms
extracellular amyloid plaques in the brain.5 Tau, on the other hand, is an intracellular microtubule-associated
protein, which helps in stabilizing the microtubules.6 The domain organization of Tau is depicted in Figure 1A. Tau protein aggregates
in response to various factors-like genetic mutations, abnormal post-translational
modifications, etc.7−9 Tau aggregates accumulate in the neurons forming
paired helical filaments (PHFs) followed by neurofibrillary tangles
(NFTs). Although Tau lacks rigid secondary structure in native state,
it adopts a partial β-sheet structure in the pathological state.
Tau is conformationally dynamic and temperature can influence its
conformation in solution.10,11 The two hexapeptide
motifs present in the repeat region of Tau play a crucial role in
the random coil to β-sheet transition during aggregation.12,13 Since the past two decades, considerable research has been done
to search for potent therapeutics against protein aggregation in neurodegenerative
diseases.14 The target-based research has
yielded a number of candidates against amyloid-β15 and Tau pathology but with little success in
the higher clinical trials. The research has yielded therapeutics
from different classes like small molecules, natural compounds, peptide
inhibitors, etc.16,17 Along with these classes of therapeutics,
considerable research is being done in the field of nanoparticles
(NPs) with respect to protein aggregation. Several high-throughput
screening methods are also being developed to determine the interactions
between nanoparticles and proteins using fluorescent dyes like 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic
acid and Nile Red.18 The functionality
of nanoparticles is multidimensional depending on their surface charge,
size, solubility, thermostability, etc.19 The nanosize in conjunction with the large surface-to-volume ratio
makes the nanoparticles more efficient with respect to drug delivery
and crossing the blood–brain barrier.20 The size, surface area, and hydrophobicity play a crucial role in
determining the effect of nanoparticles on the protein aggregation.
These properties either enhance the fibrillization process or inhibit
it. For example, the copolymeric nanoparticles N-isopropylacrylamide/N-tert-butylacrylamide (NIPAM/BAM) decrease
the lag times for the fibrillization process of β2-microglobulin. The hydrophobic surface enhances the association
of protein monomers with nanoparticles, thus decreasing the critical
concentration required for nucleation.21 Apart from the nanoparticle properties, protein stability and amino
acid composition the in-built aggregation, propensity also plays a
role for the interaction with nanoparticles, and this interaction
determines the fate of protein fibrillation.22 This is reflected in a study with NIPAM/BAM copolymeric nanoparticles,
wherein these nanoparticles lengthen the nucleation phase and thus
delay the polymerization of amyloid-β protein. This effect of
the nanoparticles might be attributed to the firm binding of amyloid-β
monomers to the nanoparticles, thus blocking the sites for binding
of the free monomers to initiate the polymerization.23

Figure 1 (A) Tau protein and its domains. The full-length Tau protein comprises
two major domains, projection and microtubule-binding domain. The
projection domain includes two inserts and a polyproline stretch.
The microtubule-binding domain has four imperfect repeats of 29 amino
acids each of which is mainly involved in binding to microtubules.
These repeats also form the core of paired helical filaments (PHFs)
that enhances the aggregation of Tau protein. (B) Table of nanoparticles
with their chemical composition.

The concentration of nanoparticles or the ratio between the
amyloid-β protein and nanoparticles also modulates the fibrillation
process with higher particles concentration leading to abolishment
of fibril formation.24 Considering all
of these characteristics, we screened biologically synthesized protein-capped
(PC) nanoparticles to study their function with respect to Tau protein
aggregation. As already discussed above, Tau protein misfolding and
aggregation is one of the major causes of neuronal death in AD, and
the biologically synthesized metal nanoparticles were screened against
Tau aggregation.

The important characteristics of the nanoparticles
used are their complete biological synthesis using two fungal species; Fusarium oxysporum and Verticillium sp.25 The composition of capping proteins
varies according to the nanoparticles synthesized. For example, the
magnetite nanoparticles are capped with hydrolytic proteins from fungi,
whereas the CdS nanoparticles are capped with the mixture of four
different proteins probably belonging to the group of sulfate-reducing
enzymes. The crystalline iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized
extracellularly by the fungal species at ambient temperature with
transient ferromagnetic properties, which otherwise would require
the use of toxic chemical and investment of large amount of energy.26 The fungal synthesis of these nanoparticles,
which layers it with capping proteins, might play a role in their
morphology. The synthesis of CdS nanoparticles was also performed
by the fungal species by a complete enzymatic process. These nanoparticles
are synthesized from the extracellular sulfate-reducing enzymes secreted
by the fungus when provided with mixture of salts. The particles size
falls under the quantum dots type and are easy to isolate due to extracellular
synthesis.27 The gold nanoparticles were
synthesized by Verticillium species
via bioreduction of AuCl4– ions.28 These NPs were synthesized in the fungal cell walls. To
observe the effect of biologically synthesized metal nanoparticles
on Tau assembly, we selected a set of three nanoparticles (Figure 1B). The main aim
of this study was to determine whether the protein-capped metal nanoparticles
inhibit Tau fibrillization in vitro and to inhibit Tau fibrillization
in vitro and to observe the morphology of nanoparticles-treated Tau
aggregates.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization of PC-Metal
Nanoparticles
The synthesis of the PC-metal nanoparticles
was carried out by fungal species of F. oxysporum and Verticillium sp. In brief, the synthesis of
these particles was carried out by exposing the fungi to the aqueous
mixtures of ferricynanide or ferrocyanide for 24 h for magnetite nanoparticles29 and Cd2+ and SO42– ions for CdS nanoparticles.27 Further,
the nanoparticles were characterized by various techniques.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of magnetite nanoparticles
was found to be nonuniform with quasi-spherical morphology. The nanoparticle
size was found to be 50–60 nm (Figure S3A), which is in conjunction with the previous characterization, wherein
the size was found to be within 20–60 nm. The crystalline nature
of nanoparticles was deduced from selected area electron diffraction
analysis, and Bragg reflection characteristic of Fe3O4 was observed in the X-ray diffraction analysis in our previous
studies. Fourier transform infrared analysis demostrated prominent
resonances at 522, 568, and 627 nm, which can be attributed to Fe–O–Fe
stretching modes of vibrations. Two absorption bands were also observed
in amide I and amide II regions, which indicates the presence of proteins
in the preparation of nanoparticles. These capping proteins were further
characterized and found to be 55 kDa, cationic with hydrolytic activity
capable of hydrolysis of anionic iron complexes to form PC-metal nanoparticles.29

UV–vis spectra of CdS nanoparticles
showed an absorption peak at 450 nm, which highlights the characteristic
size of nanoparticles in the quantum regime. The presence of capping
proteins was elucidated by absorption peak at 280 nm. These capping
proteins probably prevent the aggregation of nanoparticles, as evidenced
by TEM analysis, wherein dispersed nanoparticles with average size
between 10 and 20 nm were observed (Figure S3B). Further analysis of capping proteins suggested possible presence
of sulfate-reducing enzymes, which could synthesize CdS nanoparticles
from Cd2+ and SO42– ions.27 Based on this previous characterization, the
nanoparticles were checked for their activity against Tau aggregation
and PHF dissolution.

PC-Metal Nanoparticles Inhibit Tau Fibrillization
Tau aggregation inhibition has been studied with respect to various
molecules, which might have potential therapeutic application. Most
of these molecules belong to different classes of synthetic or naturally
occurring small molecules.30,31 The effect of PC-metal
nanoparticles was studied for inhibition of Tau PHF assembly. The
aggregation kinetics of full-length Tau in the presence of three PC-metal
nanoparticles (Figure 1B) showed an inhibitory effect of varying degree (Figure 2A,B). The PC-CdS nanoparticles
showed 63% inhibition of Tau aggregation, followed by PC-iron oxide
NPs as 49% and gold nanoparticles as 18%. Recent reports suggest that
the nanocomposites loaded with methylene blue efficiently reduce AD
symptoms in animal models by reducing Tau hyperphosphorylation and
relieving the mitochondrial dysfunction.32 Our study shows direct effect of PC-NPs on Tau aggregation inhibition
and dissolution of mature fibrils.

Figure 2 Effect of nanoparticles on Tau PHF assembly.
The effect of three nanoparticles was tested for the inhibitory activity
on Tau aggregation. (A) Thioflavin S (ThS) fluorescence was found
to increase at the initial time points for treated as well as control
samples. Further, the time-dependent decrease in intensity was observed
in the treated samples. (B) Comparative analysis of the end time point
fluorescence showed maximum inhibition of PHF assembly by PC-CdS NPs.
(C) ThS fluorescence showed a concentration-dependent decrease with
increase in the concentration of PC-Fe3O4 NPs.
(D) The highest concentration of PC-Fe3O4 NPs
(1 mg/mL) showed 49% inhibition of aggregation propensity of hTau40WT. (E) Concentration-dependent inhibition of Tau aggregation
by PC-CdS NPs showed a rapid decrease in ThS fluorescence. (F) PC-CdS
NPs (1 mg/mL) treatment shows 63% inhibition of Tau PHF assembly.
(The values are mean ± standard deviation of three independent
experiments.)

Iron Oxide and Cadmium
Sulfide PC-Nanoparticles Inhibit Tau Polymerization Efficiently
The comparative analysis of these three PC-metal nanoparticles
revealed that the iron oxide and cadmium sulfide PC-NPs were more
potent in inhibiting Tau aggregation and thus were selected for further
studies. The inhibitory dose for Tau aggregation was determined by
treating the soluble Tau with a range of concentrations of NPs (0–1
mg/mL). The aggregation kinetics revealed a concentration-dependent
decrease in ThS fluorescence with increase in incubation time (Figure 2C,E). Both the nanoparticles
PC-Fe3O4 and PC-CdS showed 49 and 63% inhibition,
respectively, at the highest concentration of the treatment (1 mg/mL)
(Figure 2D,F). The
PC-CdS NPs treatment showed an efficient inhibition compared to PC-Fe3O4 NPs as the ThS fluorescence decreased to a greater
extent from day 4 onward compared to control.

The PC-Fe3O4 nanoparticles are crystalline and show a signature
ferromagnetic transition.29 The size of
the particles ranges from 40 to 50 nm. The PC-Fe3O4 nanoparticles show a lower rate of inhibition compared to
PC-CdS NPs. The PC-CdS nanoparticles have a size ranging from 5 to
20 nm, and the enhanced rate of aggregation inhibition might be due
to differential adsorption properties on these nanoparticles. The
iron oxide nanoparticles find the applications in biomedical fields
of imaging (magnetic resonance imaging) as they act as efficient contrasting
agents.

Apart from this, the iron oxide nanoparticles are also
used in the magnetic drug delivery in cancer treatment.33 The ferromagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles have
recently been found to adsorb amyloid-β with the specificity
for aggregates but not monomers.34 Here,
we report that the biologically synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles
can interfere with Tau aggregation and inhibit it. The inhibitory
effect of iron oxide nanoparticles might be attributed to the size
or the surface charge of nanoparticles or both. The careful analysis
of the polymerization kinetics of Tau in the presence of PC-Fe3O4 nanoparticles reveals an initial increase in
the ThS intensity for the higher concentration of NPs suggesting an
efficient adsorption of intermediate Tau aggregates on these NPs.
But the gradual drop in ThS fluorescence suggests the inhibition of
Tau fibrillation in the presence of PC-NPs. The sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis also showed an initial increase
in the intensity of intermediate aggregates with gradual decrease
at subsequent time intervals. All of these observations suggest that
the intermediate aggregates might be adsorbed on the surface of nanoparticles
in such a way that they are inefficient in undergoing further fibrillation.
Similar mechanism had been observed and postulated for aggregation
inhibition of amyloid-β.22,35,36 The adsorption phenomenon might be due to the coat protein composition
on the NPs, which could enhance the interaction of Tau and NPs, but
this needs to be further investigated.

Morphological Characteristics
of PC-Nanoparticles-Treated Tau
Tau protein forms the fibrillar
aggregates upon assembly. The nanoparticles treatment inhibited the
formation of the fibrillar aggregates (Figure 3). The control shows the presence of filamentous
Tau aggregates (Figure 3A), but the nanoparticles-treated samples showed the presence of
amorphous Tau aggregates (Figure 3C,D). Nanoparticles without Tau were also visualized
by TEM. Thus, nanoparticles prevent Tau aggregation by leading to
the formation of amorphous aggregates that cannot form potentially
toxic fibrils.

Figure 3 Effect of nanoparticles on morphology of Tau aggregates.
(A) The control sample demonstrates the presence of long fibrillar
aggregates (black arrow). (B) PC-Fe3O4 and PC-CdS
NPs-, (C) PC-Fe3O4 NPs-, and (D) PC-CdS NPs-treated
Tau show the presence of only amorphous aggregates (enclosed in dotted
lines). These amorphous aggregates are seen in the presence of agglomerates
of the nanoparticles (white arrow and black stars).

SDS-PAGE Analysis of PC-Nanoparticles-Mediated
Tau Aggregation Inhibition
Tau aggregation leads to the formation
of SDS-resistant higher-order Tau aggregates that are visualized by
SDS-PAGE. The SDS-PAGE analysis of Tau inhibition by nanoparticles
showed that, initially, PC-Fe3O4 NPs treatment
leads to the formation of higher-order aggregates that become prominent
at 24 h but reduce in intensity as the time of incubation increases
(Figures 4A and S1A). At 168 h of incubation, most of the higher-order
aggregates disappear compared to control. On the other hand, PC-CdS
NPs show the disappearance of the higher-order aggregates in an early
period of incubation (24 h). At 48 h, there is complete absence of
higher-order aggregates in the highest concentration of PC-CdS NPs
(Figures 4B and S1B).

Figure 4 (A) SDS-PAGE quantification showing the time-
and dose-dependent decrease in intensity, suggesting inhibition of
Tau aggregation by PC-Fe3O4 NPs. (B) SDS-PAGE
quantification of PC-CdS NPs-treated Tau showing a significant decrease
in intensity demonstrating Tau aggregation inhibition. (The values
are mean ± standard deviation of two independent experiments.)

These results confirm with the
kinetics data that both types of nanoparticles prevented the formation
Tau aggregates. The cadmium sulfide nanoparticles are being widely
used as semiconductors in electronic devices due to their small size.37 They have a large number of biomedical applications,
including probe development, cellular imaging, biomedical diagnostics,
etc. The multivariate applications is due to the differential fluorescence
properties of these nanoparticles owing to their size.38 In our study, to the best of our knowledge,
we are reporting for the first time that PC-CdS nanoparticles can
inhibit Tau aggregation in vitro in an efficient manner. The kinetics
and the SDS-PAGE analysis suggest the adsorption of soluble proteins
on the surface of the nanoparticles, which might prevent them from
aggregation.

PC-CdS Nanoparticles Disassemble Tau PHFs
The potency of PC-CdS NPs in inhibiting Tau fibrillization led
to further investigating their role in Tau disassembly. The PHF disassembly
was observed in the PC-CdS NPs-treated reactions in a concentration-dependent
manner. The ThS kinetics revealed the PHF disassembly even at low
concentrations of 0.1 mg/mL (Figure 5A) Moreover, the highest concentration of 0.5 mg/mL
showed the disassembly starting at 3 h. At the end of 36 h, the highest
concentration of PC-CdS nanoparticles (0.5 mg/mL) showed 88% PHF disassembly
(Figure 5B). The inhibition
shown in kinetics was also confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The SDS-PAGE analysis
demonstrated that nanoparticles efficiently cleared the Tau aggregates
at submicrogram concentrations. At the extended incubations, complete
clearance of PHFs was observed in all treated samples on the SDS-PAGE
(Figure 5C). The disassembly
analysis by electron microscopy showed fibrillar aggregates, which
are well-separated, single fibrils (Figure S2A). The PC-CdS-treated fibrils showed the presence of broken fragments
of Tau fibrils at 0 h (Figure S2B). The
pieces were observed to be clumped together. At 36 h, the clumps of
broken fibrils at heavily stained regions were observed (Figure S2C). This might be due to adsorption
of fibrils on the agglomerated nanoparticles, which may help in Tau
fibril disassembly.

analysis of PHF disassembly by PC-CdS NPs showing time- and concentration-dependent
clearance of PHFs.

Neuronal Cell Toxicity
of Nanoparticles
The toxicity of nanoparticles was assessed
on neuroblastoma cell line neuro2a. The cells were treated with 5–100
μg/mL of nanoparticles. The PC-Fe3O4 NPs
did not show toxicity and maintained the significant viability at
around 80% even at higher concentration of 100 μg/mL (Figure 6A). The cell morphology
was also maintained with intact neuritic extensions at all of the
concentrations (Figure S4). The uncapped
CdS nanoparticles are found to be toxic to bacterial as well as HeLa
cells due to increased reactive oxygen species production and the
resulting oxidative stress.39 But capping
confers an entirely different property upon these nanoparticles, which
make them more biocompatible. The PC-CdS nanoparticles showed more
than 50% viability up to 10 μg/mL (Figure 6B), suggesting the role of capping in masking
the toxicity of otherwise toxic CdS nanoparticles. Although the PC-CdS
NPs reduced the viability of neuro2a cells beyond 10 μg/mL,
the cell morphology was not significantly affected at the higher concentrations
(Figure S5). The dextrin-capped CdS NPs
do not show toxicity at lower concentrations on HepG2 and HeLa cell
line.37 This is in agreement with our observations
that the protein-capped CdS nanoparticles show no cytotoxicity in
methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay for the neuronal
cells at concentrations lower than 10 μg/mL when exposed for
24 h.

Figure 6 Neuronal cell toxicity of nanoparticles. (A) Neuro2a neuroblastoma
cell line treated with PC-Fe3O4 NPs does not
show any toxic effects up to 100 μg/mL of dose. The concentrations
up to 0.5 μg/mL rather showed enhanced viability compared to
control. (B) PC-CdS NPs are not found to be cytotoxic to the neuronal
cell line up to 10 μg/mL. The viability is found to decrease
beyond 50% at 25–100 μg/mL dosages. (The values are mean
± standard deviation of three independent experiments.)

Thus, apart from the application
of iron oxide and cadmium sulfide nanoparticles in the biomedical
diagnostic devices, we report a novel role of these nanoparticles
in inhibiting the aggregation of Tau protein, which can have potential
therapeutic benefits. Although the nanoparticles can act as excellent
delivery systems and inhibit the in vitro protein aggregation via
varied specific and nonspecific interactions, the in vivo translation
of this activity is challenging due to various interfering molecular
species. Thus, this needs to be addressed by use of relevant animal
models as well as applying the specific techniques to get the desired
output.40

Materials and Methods
Tau Protein
Purification
The Tau protein purification was carried out
as previously described.41 In brief, the
bacterial cell pellets expressing the recombinant Tau protein were
homogenized and the obtained lysate was boiled at 90 °C for 15
min after addition of 0.5 M NaCl and 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). The
lysate was centrifuged at 40 000 rpm for 50 min. The supernatant
was dialyzed in Sepharose A buffer overnight. The obtained dialyzed
sample was then subjected to ultracentrifugation, and the supernatant
was loaded onto the cation exchange column for further purification.
The bound protein was eluted using an ionic gradient. The eluted proteins
were pooled and concentrated for size exclusion chromatography (SEC).
Post SEC, the protein was concentrated and the concentration was determined
by bicinchoninic acid assay.

Tau Aggregation Inhibition Assay
Soluble Tau protein (20 μM) was incubated in 20 mM BES buffer
pH 7.4 (Sigma) with 5 μM Heparin 17 500 Da (MP Biomedicals)
in the presence of 25 mM NaCl (MP Biomedicals), 1 mM DTT (Calbiochem),
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 0.01% sodium azide (MP Biomedicals),
and different concentrations of nanoparticles ranging from 0 to 1
mg/mL. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C.

ThS Fluorescence
Assay
ThS fluorescence assay monitored Tau aggregates formation
as follows. The reaction mixtures (5 μL) were diluted in 50
mM ammonium acetate pH 7.0 containing 8 μM ThS to a final volume
of 50 μL. The ratio of protein to ThS was maintained as 1:4
for the fluorescence measurement. Fluorescence measurements were carried
out using Tecan Infinite 200 Pro series plate reader. The excitation
and emission wavelengths were set at 440 and 521 nm, respectively.
The readings were carried out in triplicate for each sample at 25 °C.
The fluorescence was normalized for background by subtracting the
buffer blank fluorescence.

Disaggregation of Tau PHFs
The PHFs
for Tau were prepared by incubating 100 μM protein with 25 μM
Heparin 17 500 Da in 20 mM BES buffer pH 7.4 with 25 mM NaCl.
Other additives like protease inhibitor cocktail, sodium azide, and
DTT were added as already mentioned in the respective ratios. The
reaction tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 8 days. The PHF formation
was confirmed by ThS fluorescence and SDS-PAGE analysis. These PHFs
were incubated with a range of concentrations of nanoparticles at
37 °C. The disaggregation of Tau was monitored by ThS fluorescence
as well as SDS-PAGE analysis.

Electron Microscopy Analysis
For electron microscopy, 2 μM reaction mixtures were applied
to 400 mesh carbon-coated copper grids for 45 s followed by two washes
with ultrapure water for 45 s each. The samples were negatively stained
for 1 min using 2% uranyl acetate. The dried grids were analyzed using
a Tecnai T20 transmission electron microscope.

SDS-PAGE Analysis
The inhibition of PHF assembly by nanoparticles was confirmed by
loading the reaction mixtures at different time intervals on 10% SDS-PAGE.
The SDS-PAGE gel quantification was carried out using Image Lab software
(Bio-Rad). The quantification was carried out for two sets of independent
assay gels, and the obtained intensities were plotted as bar graphs.

MTT Cell Toxicity Assay
The neuro2a cells were seeded in
96-well culture plates at the cell density of 10 000 cells/well.
The cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium F12 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotic
(Pen-Strep) for 24 h. The cells were treated with nanoparticles (0–100
μg/mL) in serum-starved media (0.5% FBS) for 24 h. Methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium
bromide (MTT, 0.5 mg/mL) was added to each well and incubated for
3 h at 37 °C. The formazan crystals formed after reduction of
MTT by viable cells enzymes were dissolved in 100 μL of 100%
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The purple color developed was measured
at 570 nm in TECAN plate reader.

Statistical Analysis
All of the graphical representation and standard deviation calculations
were carried out using SigmaPlot 10.2.
