We
have systematically studied the strain relaxation processes
in GaSb heteroepitaxy on GaAs(111)A using thin InAs interlayers. The
growth with 1 ML- and 2 ML-InAs leads to formation of an InAsSb-like
layer, which induces tensile strain in GaSb films, whereas the GaSb
films grown with thicker InAs layers (≥3 ML) are under compressive
strain. As the InAs thickness is increased above 5 ML, the insertion
of the InAs layer becomes less effective in the strain relaxation,
leaving residual strain in GaSb films. This leads to the elastic deformation
of the GaSb lattice, giving rise to the increase in the peak width
of X-ray rocking curves.

1 Introduction
GaSb-based
semiconductor material systems are of considerable interest
for the application to electronic and optoelectronic devices, such
as emitters and detectors operating at near-infrared and mid-wavelength
regions.1−4 Heteroepitaxy on lattice-mismatched substrates, such as GaAs and
Si, is favored for the fabrication of GaSb-based devices, because
low-cost wafers with larger diameter are available. However, the extremely
large lattice-mismatch (e.g., 7.8% for GaSb on GaAs) prevents the
growth of atomically flat GaSb films and gives rise to the high density
of defects.

Heteroepitaxy with a large lattice mismatch usually
follows a Stranski–Krastanov
(SK) growth mode: a strained two-dimensional layer is formed under
a certain critical thickness, beyond which three-dimensional islands
are formed to relieve the strain. Exceptionally, in marked contrast
to the conventional SK growth for the (001) orientation,5 InAs grows in a layer-by-layer mode on the GaAs(111)A6,7 and (110)8 substrates: periodic arrays
of misfit dislocations are formed at the InAs/GaAs interface to accommodate
the large lattice mismatch of 7.1%. It has been also reported that
(111)A-oriented InAs films are two-dimensionally grown on the In-terminated
Si(111) surface,9 despite a larger lattice
mismatch of 11.5%. On the other hand, GaSb, having a lattice constant
(0.6097 nm) close to that of InAs (0.6055 nm), forms islands on GaAs(111)A10 and Si(111)11 substrates.
In addition, the layer-by-layer growth does not occur in the In0.25Ga0.75As/GaAs(111)A system with a smaller lattice
mismatch of ∼1.8%.9

We have
recently reported that the insertion of a thin interface
layer of InAs between GaSb and Si successfully allows smooth layer-by-layer
growth of GaSb films.11 The growth with
InAs layers is also effective to improve the crystalline quality and
surface morphology of the In0.25Ga0.75As film
on the GaAs(111)A substrate.12 This paper
presents a systematic study on the GaSb heteropitaxy on GaAs(111)A
using the InAs interlayer. We found that the strain evolution and
growth mode drastically change with the InAs layer thickness. The
GaSb films grown with thick (>3 ML) InAs layers are under compressive
strain, as if the growth proceeds on the bulk InAs substrate. On the
other hand, Sb atoms are preferentially incorporated in the 1ML and
2 ML-InAs layers forming the InAsSb-like phase, so that tensile strain
is accumulated in GaSb films. The specific role of the InAs interlayer
in the strain relaxation in GaSb/GaAs(111)A heteroepitaxy, which strongly
affects the resultant structural properties of GaSb, will be discussed.

2 Experiments
The growth experiments were performed using
a multichamber molecular-beam
epitaxy system.13 The clean surface of
GaAs(111)A was obtained using the procedures described in our previous
paper.14 The clean and well-ordered Ga-rich
(2 × 2) reconstruction was confirmed by scanning tunneling microscopy,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and reflection high-energy electron
diffraction (RHEED). The InAs films with thickness in the range of
1 ML to 50 ML were grown at 430 °C with an As4/In
ratio of ∼50. After a good ultra-high vacuum condition of 5
× 10–10 Torr was recovered, the growth of GaSb
was initiated by simultaneously opening the Ga and Sb shutters at
430 °C with an Sb4/Ga flux ratio of ∼4. The
substrate temperatures were measured using an infrared pyrometer and
were calibrated by melting the InSb sample at 525 °C. The growth
rates of InAs and GaSb were approximately 0.0167 and 0.085 ML/s (0.3
nm/s), respectively. The growing GaSb surface shows a  RHEED
pattern, which is characteristic
of the Sb-stabilized reconstruction on the GaSb(111)A surface. The
growth processes of GaSb were monitored by RHEED in real time. Structural
properties of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction
(XRD), atomic-force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). All the AFM images were obtained in the tapping mode. High-resolution
XRD measurements were carried out using a monochromatic Cu Kα1
radiation. A channel-cut analyzer crystal was used for X-ray rocking
curve (XRC) measurements, because the full width at half-maximum (fwhm)
values obtained from the XRC measurements without a slit are overestimated
for thin (<100 nm) GaSb films. We note that no significant difference
was observed for the GaSb thickness above 100 nm between the XRC results
obtained using the crystal analyzer and the open detector.

3 Results and Discussion
Figure 1a,b shows
the lattice constants of 300 nm-thick GaSb films in the directions
parallel (d110) and normal (d111) to the surface, respectively, plotted as a function
of the thickness of the InAs interlayer. The d110 and d111 values were measured
from two-dimensional reciprocal-space maps (RSMs) for the asymmetric
115 reflection (Figure S1). The GaSb film
grown without the InAs layer is most compressed in the in-plane directions,
and has a d110 value of 0.4301 nm, which
is significantly smaller than that of bulk GaSb (0.431 nm). The in-plane
compressive strain induces an increase in d111: as shown in Figure 1b, the measured d111 value is in good
agreement with that calculated from the d110 value on the basis of classical elastic theory.15

Figure 1 Lattice constants of the GaSb film (300 nm-thick) in the directions
parallel (a) and normal (b) to the surface plotted as a function of
the InAs thickness. The values are estimated from the RSMs (Figure S1). Shown by crosses in (b) are the values
calculated from d110 on the basis of classical
elastic theory.

The insertion of 1 ML
and 2 ML thick InAs increases (decreases)
the d110 (d111) value: the GaSb film grown with 2 ML-InAs shows a maximum expansion
of d110 (0.4315 nm). The d110 (d111) value, then, decreases
(increases) with further increasing InAs thickness, and is almost
unchanged above 5 ML. These results are closely related with the initial
growth processes of GaSb, as we will show below.

Figure 2 shows the
variation of d110 during the GaSb growth.
The d110 values were measured from the
distance between the 11 and 1̅1̅ reflections in RHEED
patterns. The in-plane lattice constant of the InAs film on GaAs(111)A
increases with film thickness, as already reported,6,7 and
the 1 ML-, 2 ML-, 3 ML-, and 10 ML-InAs films have d110 values of 0.405, 0.410, 0.414 nm, and 0.422 nm, respectively,
before the GaSb growth. Thus, the lattice mismatch is decreased from
7.8 to 2.1%, as the InAs thickness is increased from 0 ML (a) to 10
ML (e). Regardless of the lattice mismatch, the initial increase in d110 is commonly observed in Figure 2a–e, indicating that
pseudomorphic GaSb layers are not formed. This is in marked contrast
to the case for the InAs heteroepitaxy on GaAs(111)A, where the 1–2
ML thick InAs film is fully strained.6,7

Figure 2 Variation of the in-plane
lattice constant (d110) of GaSb films
grown on InAs (0–10 ML)/GaAs(111)A
substrates. The values were measured from the distance between the
11 and 1̅1̅ reflections in the RHEED patterns. Arrowheads
indicate local maxima and minima.

When the GaSb was directly grown on the GaAs substrate, the d110 value monotonically increases with GaSb
thickness and is smaller than the bulk value throughout the growth
(Figure 2a). On the
other hand, for the GaSb growth with 1 ML- (2 ML-) InAs, the d110 value initially increases and has a maximum
at 0.6 nm (0.3 nm): the maximum d110 values
are larger than that of bulk GaSb, and d110 values are gradually decreased with further increasing GaSb thickness,
as shown in Figure 2b,c. Thus, it appears likely that Sb atoms are preferentially incorporated
in InAs layers at the initial stage of the GaSb growth to form an
InAsSb-like phase. To confirm this hypothesis, only the Sb4 molecular beam was supplied on the GaAs(111)A and InAs/GaAs(111)A
surfaces. When the GaAs(111)A surface was exposed to the Sb beam,
no change was observed in the streak position, indicating that the
incorporation of Sb in GaAs is negligible. On the other hand, for
2 ML-InAs, a new set of faint streaks with a smaller d-spacing appeared in addition to the streaks from the InAs layer.
The d110 value is estimated to be 0.452
nm, which corresponds to InAsxSb1–x with x = 0.2–0.3.

The data for the growth with 3 ML- and 10 ML-InAs (Figure 2d,e) also show the local maxima
at 0.5 nm, suggesting the formation of InAsSb-like phases. As the d110 values at their local maxima are smaller
than that of bulk GaSb, it is likely that the incorporation of Sb
in InAs layers is very limited. However, there still remains the question
as to why the Sb incorporation is most enhanced on the 2 ML thick
InAs film. The d110 value, then, decreases
and has a local minimum at 0.75 nm (1.2 nm) for the growth on 3 ML-InAs
(10 ML-InAs), followed by a monotonic increase. The strain relaxation
in GaSb proceeds more rapidly on 3 ML-InAs than on 10 ML-InAs: there
are 94 and 76% relaxations in 30 nm-films for 3 ML- and 10 ML-InAs,
respectively. We confirmed that the d110 data for 5–50 ML-InAs thickness behave similarly as a function
of GaSb thickness.

The insertion of InAs layers has a critical
effect also on the
surface morphology of the growing GaSb film. The GaSb film directly
grown on the GaAs substrate is roughened at the very early stage of
the growth (0.3–6 nm). On the other hand, for the GaSb films
grown with InAs interlayers thicker than 3 ML, planar growth is observed
in the whole range of the GaSb film thickness. However, the use of
1 ML and 2 ML-InAs layers has the opposite effect to promote the planar
growth: the growth front roughening persists until the GaSb film thickness
exceeds 15 nm. As tensile strained growth on (111)A-oriented substrates
leads to island formation,16,17 the tensile strain
in GaSb films grown with 1 ML- and 2 ML-InAs could be responsible
for the observed surface roughening.

Figure 3a shows
the fwhm values of XRCs of the asymmetric 111 reflection measured
from 300 nm thick GaSb films plotted as a function of the InAs thickness.
When the InAs thickness is in the range of 1–5 ML, the fwhm
value is less than 50 arcsec, whereas the value drastically increases
above 5 ML. Shown in Figure 3b are the root-mean-square (rms) roughness of the 300 nm-GaSb
films estimated from AFM images (Figure S2). The GaSb films grown with 3–10 ML-InAs layers show smooth
surface morphologies with an rms roughness of ∼1 nm. On the
other hand, for the InAs layer thickness below and above these values,
the GaSb surface shows a higher rms roughness. Similar results have
been reported for InGaAs/GaAs heteroepitaxy using thin amorphous InGaAs
interlayers: the improved crystalline quality of the In0.3Ga0.7As film is achieved using the amorphous In0.6Ga0.4As interlayers with optimized thickness of 2 nm.18,19

Figure 3 fwhm
values of the XRC (a) and rms roughness (b) of 300 nm thick
GaSb(111)A films plotted as a function of the film thickness of the
InAs interlayer.

It has been generally
believed that the broadening of XRC profiles
in heteroepitaxial layers is caused by the formation of high densities
of threading defects.20−22 Thus, one may suppose that high-quality GaSb films
with a flat surface are grown on GaAs(111)A with 3–5 ML thick
InAs interlayers. However, our plan-view and cross-sectional TEM observations
show that the density of the threading dislocation in the GaSb film
grown with 10 ML-InAs is 2 × 109 cm–2, which is significantly lower than the values in GaSb films grown
with 3 ML-InAs (4 × 109 cm–2) and
without InAs (8 × 109 cm–2). These
results indicate that narrower XRC widths are not necessarily an indication
of lower density of threading defects.

Figure 4a,b compares
the 111 XRCs measured from the 100 nm-GaSb films grown with 3 ML-
and 10 ML-InAs. The measured data are fitted with two Gaussian functions:
sharp and broad components are necessary to fit the results. Such
peak profiles consisting of two components have been reported for
various lattice-mismatched systems,23−25 and the broad component
could be ascribed to the diffuse scattering because of the existence
of misfit dislocations at the interfaces.26,27 For 300 nm-GaSb films (Figure 4c,d), whereas the peak profile (c) consists of the
two components, the result for 10 ML-InAs (d) is well fitted by a
single broad component: the diffuse component associated with misfit
dislocations, which is clearly seen in (b), is likely to be hidden
behind the main peak with large fwhm in Figure 4d. The fwhm value of peak (d) is 694.3 arcsec,
and is more than an order of magnitude larger than that for the sharp
main peak in (c) (33.4 arcsec).

Figure 4 111 XRCs of 100 nm-GaSb films grown on
InAs (3 ML)/GaAs(111)A (a)
and InAs (10 ML)/GaAs(111)A (b). (c,d) show the results for 300 nm-GaSb
films.

The changes in the width and shape
of XRCs are closely related
with the strain relaxation processes in GaSb, as we will show below.
Shown in Figure 5a,b
are the evolutions of d110 and d111 values, respectively. Also plotted in Figure 5b are the d111 values calculated from the measured d110 values (crosses in Figure 5b) on the basis of classical elastic theory.15 Whereas the d110 value of the initial 3 ML-InAs film (0.414 nm) is smaller than that
of 10 ML-InAs (0.422 nm), the GaSb lattice on 3 ML-InAs is more expanded
laterally than those on 10 ML-InAs. This means that the strain relaxation
in GaSb proceeds more rapidly on 3 ML-InAs than on 10 ML-InAs, as
mentioned earlier: there are ∼96 and ∼80% relaxations
for 100 nm-GaSb films for 3 ML- and 10 ML-InAs, respectively. As expected
from the results in Figure 5a, the d111 values of GaSb on
10 ML-InAs are larger than those for 3 ML-InAs (Figure 5b). In addition, the measured d111 values are larger than that of bulk GaSb (0.352 nm)
and are gradually decreased with increasing film thickness. Here we
note that, in Figure 5b, the d111 values measured from the
30 nm films (circles) are slightly smaller than the calculated values
(crosses). A similar result has been reported for InAs/GaAs(111)A
heteroepitaxy: the InAs lattice is under compressive strain in both
surface-normal and surface-parallel directions at the initial stage
of the growth.7

Figure 5 (a,b) show lattice constant
parallel (d110) and normal (d111) to the surface, respectively,
plotted as a function of the GaSb film thickness. The d110 and d111 values have been
estimated from the position of the 115 reflection of GaSb in RSMs
(Figure 6). (c) Evolution
of fwhm of the 111 XRC.

Figure 5c
shows
the evolution of the fwhm value of the 111 XRC. For the growth on
10 ML-InAs, the fwhm value (open circles) is less than 50 arcsec below
100 nm, but it is drastically increased above 200 nm. On the other
hand, as shown in Figure 5a, the d110 value shows nothing
particularly remarkable between 100 and 200 nm. As the strain in 100
nm-GaSb on 10 ML-InAs has relaxed by only ∼80%, it is plausible
that the residual strain accumulated in the GaSb film above 100 nm
is hardly relaxed by misfit dislocations alone and that the GaSb lattice
begins to be elastically deformed to accommodate the strain: elastic
deformation results in the distortion of the crystal unit cell, leading
to shift in the position of the diffraction spots, giving rise to
the broadening of the XRC width. In marked contrast with 10 ML-InAs,
as shown by open circles in Figure 5a, the fwhm value of GaSb grown on 3 ML-InAs remains
almost unchanged as the film thickness is increased, and is smaller
than 50 arcsec in the whole range of the GaSb thickness. This means
that the elastic deformation of the GaSb lattice on 3 ML-InAs hardly
occurs, being consistent with the result that the strain in 100 nm-GaSb
has plastically relaxed by a large amount of 96% (Figure 5b).

Figure 6 shows the two-dimensional RSMs for the asymmetric
115 reflection of GaSb measured using a one-dimensional detector.
The vertical and horizontal axes represent the indices along the [111]
and [112] directions, respectively. In good agreement with the XRC
results, the 115 reflections from GaSb above 200 nm on 10 ML-InAs
are broadened along the direction perpendicular to the [115] azimuth.
This means that the broadening of the 111 XRC (Figure 4d) arises from a slight misorientation of
the GaSb lattice because of the strain-induced elastic deformation.
On the other hand, such a peak broadening is hardly observed for the
growth on 3 ML-InAs, further confirming that the elastic deformation
is suppressed.

Figure 6 RSMs of the asymmetric 115 reflection measured from GaSb
on 3 ML-InAs
(a) and 10 ML-InAs (b). Blue and red lines show the position of the
strained GaSb film and bulk GaSb, respectively. The slightly inclined
vertical streak across the peak is an instrumental artifact.

To understand the difference in
the strain relaxation processes
on 3 ML- and 10 ML-InAs, we studied the structure of the 300 nm-GaSb/InAs/GaAs(111)A
interface using cross-sectional TEM. Figure 7 shows the variations of the in-plane lattice
constant across the interfaces. The data were obtained by carrying
out one-dimensional fast Fourier transformation for high-resolution
cross-sectional TEM images in the direction parallel to the interface,
and by measuring the positions of derived spots, which correspond
to the 111 diffraction spots. The d110 value for 3 ML-InAs (Figure 7a) appears to change from 0.40 nm (GaAs) to 0.43 nm (GaSb)
across the InAs layer. We have reported that, in InGaAs/InAs/GaAs(111)A
heteroepitaxy, the thin InAs interlayer is elastically deformed to
accommodate the strain in the InGaAs film.12 Thus, similar to the case in the InGaAs/InAs/GaAs(111)A system,
it appears likely that the 3 ML-InAs lattice is laterally expanded
to be coherent with the GaSb lattice, promoting the strain relaxation
in GaSb. Here, we note that, as mentioned earlier, Sb atoms are preferentially
incorporated into the InAs layer to form an InAsSb-like phase. Thus,
it could not be ruled out that the possible formation of the GaInAsSb
phase and its compositional grading also result in the variation of d110 near the interface.

Figure 7 In-plane lattice constant
near the 300 nm-GaSb/GaAs interface with
InAs interlayers of 3 ML (a) and 10 ML (b). The data were obtained
from cross-sectional TEM images.

As shown in Figure 7b, the d110 values for 10 ML-InAs
are
almost the same as that before the GaSb growth (0.423 nm), indicating
that the misfit dislocations are also formed at the GaSb/InAs interface.
This means that the 10 ML-InAs layer is too thick to be compliant
and is hardly deformed by growing the GaSb film. As both in-plane
and surface-normal lattice constants of 300 nm-GaSb hardly depend
on the InAs thickness above 5 ML, as shown in Figure 1a,b, it is likely that the thick InAs layer
(<5 ML) is less efficient in the strain relief of GaSb.

4 Conclusions
The effects of the InAs interlayer on the
growth mode and strain
evolution in GaSb heteroepitaxy on GaAs(111)A have been studied. The
GaSb growth with the InAs interlayer proceeds under either compressive
or tensile strain depending on the InAs thickness. The structural
properties of GaSb are closely related with the growth mode and strain
relaxation processes: the GaSb film grown with a thin (3 ML) InAs
layer has an XRC width less than 50 arcsec and a high threading dislocation
density of 4 × 1010 cm–2. On the
other hand, for thick (10 ML) InAs, the XRC width is increased by
more than an order of magnitude, but the defect density is decreased.
