We
present a facile approach to electrospin nanofibers of guar
galactomannan by blending high- and low-molecular weights (MWs) of
guar. We discover that while neither native high MW guar nor hydrolyzed
low MW guar is electrospinnable on its own, their combination leads
to synergism in producing defect-free nanofibers. Such an approach
of fabricating nanofibers from blending multiple MWs of the same polymer
may provide an easy route to produce nanofibers of biopolymers which
are typically hard to electrospin. Rheological studies reveal that
a limiting amount of native guar is needed for electrospinnability,
and for those systems that have the proportionate amount of native
guar, there is a critical total concentration above which fibers form.
Interestingly, a plot of blend viscosity versus guar concentration
reveals two power-law regimes with an inflection point, above which
fiber formation can be achieved akin to the behavior observed for
pure (i.e., nonblend) polymers.

1 Introduction
Biopolymer-based
electrospun nanofibers are extensively used in
applications that include filtration, drug delivery systems, tissue
engineering, and wound dressing.1−8 The natural abundance and biodegradability of these polymers make
them ideal candidates for environment-friendly applications where
they are replacing their synthetic counterparts. Guar galactomannan
(commonly referred as guar) is a natural polysaccharide which is inexpensive,
naturally abundant, and biodegradable, approved as a GRAS (generally
regarded as safe) substance by Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
and is used in many industrial applications because of its unique
inherent properties. It is composed of a linear backbone of β-1,4-linked
mannose (M) units with α-1,6-linked galactose (G) side units
randomly distributed along the backbone (Figure 1a). The ratio of mannose to galactose units
ranges from 1.6:1 to 1.8:1,9 and the molecular
weight (MW) of native guar (abbreviated as NG henceforth) is approximately
2 × 106 Da. Being a natural polymer, guar can be hydrolyzed
by enzymes such as β-mannanase and α-galactosidase, which
cleave the polymer backbone and side units, respectively, and also
alter its rheological properties and sites of intermolecular interaction
(Figure 1b).10−16 Enzymes that hydrolyze guar are secreted specifically by the native
microflora present in human colon, thereby rendering guar the exclusive
potential of delivering oral drugs targeting the colon and gastrointestinal
tract.17,18 This ideology has been explored by researchers
seeking to use guar to orally deliver drugs to the colon in the form
of hydrogel discs,6,19 microspheres,18 and compacted or coated matrix tablets.20 Its rheological properties are also utilized in paper,
cosmetics, and textile industry to provide stability and better adhesion
to various products.21 Guar seed endosperm
is a source of water soluble gum which is used as a stabilizer, thickener,
and emulsifier in various food products such as ice creams, cake mixes,
sauces, fruit drinks, and dressings,22 where
the rheological properties are important as they give information
about stability and flow properties under processing and usage conditions.
Moreover, the high affinity of guar gum for water is utilized in the
agriculture industry, where it is used to improve water retention
and antibacterial properties of the soil.6

Electrospinning offers a simple approach for fiber fabrication
from polymer solutions of appropriate viscosity under the influence
of an electric field.23 Its ability to
produce nonwoven fibrous media in the nanometer range with interconnected
pore volume and a high surface area to volume ratio is explored in
diverse fields such as filtration devices, smart textiles for protective
clothing, wound healing, tissue scaffolds, reinforced composites,
and biosensors.1,5,7,23−26 However, electrospinning of pure
biopolymers is still considered a challenge because biopolymers have
markedly high MW (often in the 106 Da range), are naturally
highly polydisperse, and in most cases, have very complex molecular
structures. In addition, many biopolymers are saturated with hydroxyl
(−OH) and amine (−NH2) groups that tend to
form strong hydrogen bonds leading to high solution viscosity or gel
formation, both of which are detrimental to electrospinning. Hans
Tromp et al.8 have tried to electrospin
locust bean, tara, guar, konjac, and xanthan gums along with other
polysaccharides and have observed the formation of droplets or unstable
drops that were unable to reach the collector plate. They attributed
the unsuccessful fiber formation of these gums to either a low zero-shear
viscosity or, in the case of high zero-shear viscosity, a strong shear
thinning behavior. Notably, biopolymers tend to be very rigid molecules
in their native states, and their stiffness proves to be problematic
when bending and stretching of the solution jet occur during electrospinning.27−30 To overcome some of these limitations, biopolymers are often blended
with a synthetic polymer which has more flexible chains and can induce
a degree of elasticity in the blended solution so that fibers can
stretch without breaking up into droplets.29−33 Some groups have also reported electrospinning of
blends of gums such as tragacanth and almond gum with various polymers
for the ease of electrospinnability.34−37 Nevertheless, the presence of
a synthetic polymer in the fiber mat limits its efficacy in the applications
that require the presence of pure biopolymers.

We have applied
the aforementioned hypothesis to initially electrospin
NG gum blended with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), as our experiments
indicate that NG solutions are too viscous even at 1% (w/w) and could
not form a stable jet. Blending such highly viscous polymers with
shorter chain polymers, whether synthetic or natural, can increase
their degree of flexibility which might lead to formation of bead-free
nanofibers. We observed that PVA (MW ≈ 200 000) blended
well with NG to produce homogeneous solutions which electrospun uniform,
bead-free fibers. Following the NG/PVA example of blended solutions
that overcome electrospinnability limitations, we have blended NG
aqueous solution with a solution of lower MW partially hydrolyzed
guar called Sunfiber (SF) to produce nanofibers that were comprised
solely of guar. Electrospinning a biopolymer without mixing with a
synthetic polymer can increase its usefulness and functionality severalfold,
but it is quite a challenging task which remains largely unexplained.
Woerdeman et al. have demonstrated the effects of low- and high-MW
glutenin components in wheat protein on its electrospinnability without
the use of a polymer template.38 Recently,
Ewaldz and Brettmann have published an interesting review on the development
of molecular interactions during electrospinning of polymer blends;39 however, their focus was mainly on polymer–polymer
and polymer–small molecules interactions and a brief description
of polymer-free electrospinning of cyclodextrins and tannic acid,
leaving many questions related to biomolecule electrospinning unanswered.
Although there are research studies published on guar-synthetic polymer
[mostly PVA or poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)] composite nanofibers, to
the best of our knowledge, there is just one reported attempt to electrospin
guar without blending with synthetic polymers.40 Their approach was to electrospin commercial guar gum through
a series of purification steps involving filtration membranes to ensure
complete removal of insoluble residues which is one of the major reasons
behind aggregation during electrospinning. However, we report a comparatively
straight forward approach to electrospin a blend of low-MW (∼1.6
× 104 Da) SF with high-MW (∼2 × 106 Da) NG to develop sufficient entanglements in the electrospinning
mixture to produce nonbeaded and uniform fibers consisting of guar
only. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is used to examine the role
of blending in nanofiber fabrication, while rheological properties
of the blend are studied to understand the relationship between its
rheology and electrospinnability.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Electrospinning of Guar
Blends
Solutions
of NG ranging in concentration from 0.5 to 2 wt % did not produce
a stable jet or bead-free nanofibers over a range of electrospinning
parameters (voltage, flow rate, and tip-to-collector distance) described
in Section 4.4. Figure
S1a in Supporting Information displays
a representative SEM image of a 1 wt % NG sample that has been electrospun.
At low flow rates, the solution formed a drop at the syringe tip which
gradually increased in size and dripped. At high flow rates, large
drops of the solution sprayed onto the collector. Similarly, at low
voltages, the solution dripped, and at high voltages, the solution
rapidly splayed into smaller jets and sprayed onto the collector.
Although blended with 8 wt % PVA solution in different compositions
(Table S1), the resultant solutions formed
a stable jet and produced thick mats of nanofibers as shown in Figure
S1c–g in the Supporting Information. It is worth mentioning that when mixed together, NG/PVA blends
are capable of producing bead-free nanofibers with as low a concentration
as 4.8 wt % of PVA (Figure S1f in the Supporting Information), while it has been already established that even
if other electrospinning conditions are considered, PVA-only solution
is not capable of producing bead-free fibers in the concentration
range of 4–5.6 wt %.41 Electrospinnability
of a lower concentration of PVA when mixed with guar is indicative
of strong interactions between both the polymers which are responsible
for a rise in entanglements between the polymer chains, leading to
its electrospinnability at lower than reported concentrations.

To produce nanofibers whose sole chemical composition was guar, a
47 wt % solution of SF was used to blend with 1 wt % NG solution in
deionized water. Please note that on electrospinning, neither of the
individual solutions produced bead-free nanofibers even at the saturation
concentration (Figure 2a,b). However, when 1 wt % NG was blended with 47 wt % SF at 3:2
(3 part 1 wt % NG and 2 part 47 wt % SF), 1:1 and 1:3 ratios by weight,
the resulting blended solutions produced bead-free nanofibers on electrospinning
(Figure 2c–e).
Although electrospinning of blends of different forms of the same
polymer such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA; isotactic PMMA and
syndiotactic PMMA)42 has been reported
before, to our knowledge, this phenomenon of promoting electrospinnability
in a high-MW biopolymer by blending it with a lower MW version of
the same biopolymer has not been previously reported in the literature.
NG solutions are viscous even at low concentrations (Figure 3a) because of their high hydrodynamic
volume43 and hydrogen bonding, and are
therefore hard to electrospin, whereas only beaded nanofibers are
obtained from SF due to the fact that the low MW, enzyme-hydrolyzed
polymer chains are too short and rigid to form sufficient entanglements
necessary for electrospinning. Even at a concentration of ∼47
wt %, SF exhibits a much lower viscosity than 1 wt % NG guar solution
(Figure 3a). However,
blending of NG with SF produces a synergistic effect leading to the
formation of a stable jet during electrospinning that produces bead-free
nanofibers. Before choosing the ratios for blends 1 (3:2), 2 (1:1),
and 3 (1:3), we systematically blended solutions of 1 wt % NG and
47 wt % SF in various ratios, 9:1, 1:9, 8:2, 2:8, 7:3, 3:7, and so
forth, all the way to a 1:1 ratio. The blends discussed here were
the only ones that produced nanofibers by electrospinning, and their
corresponding SEM micrographs are displayed in Figure 2. For the remaining blends that were attempted,
the results varied between no fiber formation (in the extreme ratios
such as 1:9, 9:1) to highly beaded fiber formation (for various other
ratios).

guar, referred to as SF. (a) 1 wt % NG, (b) 47 wt % SF, (c) 0.6 wt

0.25 wt % NG/35.25 wt % SF (1:3).

Figure 3 Shear viscosity of (a) 1 wt % NG, 47 wt % SF and NG/SF blends 1,
2, and 3; (b) corresponding blends B1, B2, and B3 (compositions as
demonstrated in Table 1), illustrating the dominant effect of % NG on viscosity rather than
total polymer concentration.

Table 1 compares the characteristics of the three
NG/SF blends
that exhibited nanofiber formation (i.e., Figure 2c–e). Blend 1 containing 0.6% NG/18.8%
SF (Figure 2c) produced
fibers with 479 ± 58 nm diameter, and blend 2 containing 0.5%
NG/23.5% SF (Figure 2d) shows similar fiber diameter within error bars. However, further
decrease in the NG content (0.25% NG/35.25% SF) for blend 3 (Figure 2e) produces substantially
larger diameter fibers (753 ± 68 nm). Several factors need to
be considered in analyzing this data including blend composition,
total polymer concentration, surface tension, conductivity, and viscosity. Table 1 indicates that an
increase in the SF content in the blends leads to an increase in conductivity
and slight decrease in the surface tension. As it is well established
that enhancement in conductivity and decrease in surface tension of
a solution facilitates electrospinnability and formation of bead-free
thinner fibers,8,23,27 we can rule out these properties as playing a role in our system.
For example, blend 3 has the highest conductivity and lowest surface
tension amongst its counterparts (blends 1 and 2) and yet produces
the largest fiber diameter. And blend B3 with the largest conductivity
and lowest surface tension within its group does not even produce
fibers. Table 1 also
reveals that the total polymer concentration increases as we go from
blend 1 to blend 3. For a pure polymer, an increase in total polymer
concentration results in an increase in viscosity and a concomitant
increase in fiber diameter. Such a simple notion of increased total
concentration leading to higher viscosity does not hold true with
our system (Figure 3a) which is not only a blend but comprised of two disparate MWs.
If one examines the viscosity of the three blends in Figure 3a, we find the viscosities
of blends 1 and 2 to be similar, suggesting that this could be the
reason for these blends to have similar fiber diameters. However,
this argument does not hold for blend 3 which exhibits a much lower
viscosity but a larger fiber diameter. These results suggest important
roles played by blend composition particularly the NG content, as
well as total polymer concentration.

In order to decouple the effects of the NG
content from total polymer
concentration on the fiber diameter, three different blends (B1, B2,
and B3) were prepared, all with similar SF/NG ratios as of the previous
sample sets (column 5, Table 1) but maintaining same total polymer concentration in all
the sets, that is, 19.4 wt % (column 4, Table 1). We find blends B1 and B2 to show nanofiber
formation; however, the fiber diameter decreases (Table 1, Figure 4a,b) from 479 ± 58 to 350 ± 77
nm as we go from B1 to B2. In stark contrast, blend B3 (Figure 4c) exhibits complete lack of
electrospinnability, as is evident from the absence of fibers altogether.
It is worthwhile to mention here that even though blend B3 contains
a higher content of SF (19.26%) as compared to the NG content (0.14%),
the SF content is still not high enough to produce highly beaded nanofibers
as produced by 47 wt % SF solution in Figure 2b.

wt % NG/18.8 wt % SF, (b) B2—0.4 wt % NG/19 wt % SF, and (c)
B3—0.14 wt % NG/19.26 wt % SF.

A somewhat consistent picture of the observed phenomenon
regarding
samples B1–B3 can be garnered by examining the viscosity profiles
of these samples, as shown in Figure 3b. We find the viscosity of blend B2 to be lower than
that of B1. Such a decrease in viscosity, which we can attribute to
a lower NG/SF ratio, could possibly explain the smaller fiber diameter
observed in B2 (Table 1, Figure 4). In general,
the steady shear viscosity of the samples decreases progressively
as we evaluate blends B1, B2, and B3. Even though the total polymer
concentration in all three blends is the same (Table 1), the decreasing NG/SF ratio in B1, B2,
and B3, respectively, can be attributed to the observed drop in steady-state
viscosity. As SF is essentially a low viscosity Newtonian (Figure 3a), NG is the only
component that contributes to viscoelasticity. With electrospinnability
depending on the viscoelasticity of the solution, the NG content of
blend B3 is too low to cause any nanofiber formation.

This point
is illustrated by comparing blend 3 which produces bead-free
fibers with a large diameter (Figure 2e) with blend B3 which exhibits no fiber formation.
Both blend 3 and B3 have the same SF/NG ratio, with only ∼0.7%
of the polymer composition being from NG. However, the total NG content
in the solution phase of B3 is substantially higher (0.25% in B3 vs
0.14% in blend 3), leading us to hypothesize that perhaps there is
a lower limit of NG (and concomitantly total polymer) needed for creating
nanofibers. Consistent with this notion, both blend 2 (Figure 2d, Table 1) and B2 (Figure 4b, Table 1) produce nanofibers as the NG content in the blends
is significantly high to do so. However, both blends have statistically
similar fiber diameters (as confirmed by a t-test
at a = 0.5) even though the polymer concentrations
are different. The viscosity argument does not hold true in this case
as well (as it did not for blends 2 and 3), as blend 2 with a higher
viscosity would then lead to a higher fiber diameter. We believe the
similarity of the fiber diameter could be fortuitous or because both
these blends have similar blend MWs (around 57 kDa), a topic discussed
in the last part of the study. Nevertheless, this result underscores
the complexity of the system and needs more in-depth study by varying
MWs of the blends. We intend to pursue this as a follow-up to this
initial work by creating hydrolyzed guar of different MWs using enzymes
and examining blends of these with NG.

2.2 Specific
Viscosity, Blend Composition, and
Electrospinnability
To further examine the role of composition/concentration
on electrospinnability, two of the NG/SF blends that produced nanofibers,
containing 0.5% NG/23.5% SF (blend 1) and 0.6% NG/18.8% SF (blend
2) (Figure 1c,d) were
serially diluted starting with the original blend treated as 100%
down to 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, and 10%. The zero-shear viscosity
of each dilution was measured and plotted as a function of NG concentration
in wt % (Figure 5)
to examine any correlation between concentration and solution electrospinnability.
We find the zero-shear viscosity to exhibit a power-law behavior with
two distinct slopes. The viscosity increases more slowly at lower
concentration with a much steeper slope following the inflection point.
Several features are apparent from the figure. The values for the
initial slope are ∼1.9 and ∼1.6 for the blends containing
0.6% NG/18.8% SF and 0.5% NG/23.5% SF, respectively, and the values
for the second slope (after the inflection point) are ∼5.1
and ∼4.4, with the inflection point at an NG concentration
of ∼0.17 wt %, which corresponds to a total polymer concentration
of ∼3.5–4.0%. The concentration dependence is higher
than the predicted relationship for semidilute unentangled solutions
(∼1.25) and for the semidilute entangled regime than the predicted
relationship (∼3.75).44 These higher
values of the exponents are indicative of a rise in polymer association
and interaction.45 When compared to a similar
plot made for the chitosan–PEO system,46 the slopes are closer—1.3 and 6.0 with the critical concentration
reported at 2.9 wt %. It should be noted that even though the slopes
of the graph are different for both samples, the zero-shear viscosities
are effectively the same at the highest concentration as we started
with undiluted samples having similar viscosities (Figure 3a).

Figure 5 Change in zero-shear
viscosity with NG concentration. The polymer
entanglement concentration is similar in both cases.

The inflection point in viscosity versus concentration
plots has
been deemed critical for pure polymers because it separates the region
of electrospinnability from the region of nonelectrospinnability.41,45,47,48 To examine if this premise holds true for our blends, the dilutions
immediately before and after the inflection point were electrospun
and compared to the original undiluted blend. SEM images of the dilutions
of 0.6% NG/18.8% SF and 0.5% NG/23.5% blends are shown in Figures 6 and 7, respectively. Figure 6 exhibits transition from “bead only” formation
to “beads + fibers” at the inflection point and finally
to bead-free fibers for the original undiluted blend.

Figure 6 SEM images corresponding
to various blend concentrations of 0.6%
NG/18.8% SF. From (a–g): 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 100% of
the original blend composition corresponding to Figure 4.

Figure 7 SEM images corresponding to various blend
concentrations of 0.5%
NG/23.5% SF. From (a–e): 20, 30, 40, 50 and 100% of the original
blend composition shown in Figure 4.

Similarly, SEM micrographs
in Figure 7 display
the transition from “bead-only”
formation in 20 and 30% dilutions to the formation of “beads
+ fibers” at 40 and 50% dilutions, which correlates with the
presence of the critical concentration between 30 and 40% as indicated
in Figure 5. The concentration
which can electrospin bead-free fibers has been reported in the literature
for pure polymers to be 2.5–3 times the critical concentration.41,45,47,48 Interestingly, the same relation also seems to hold for our blends,
as we find bead-free fibers formed from a solution at approximately
three times the critical concentration.

Our results taken together
reveal composition and concentration
of blends to be an important determinant in electrospinnability. We
attempt in Figure 8 and Table S2 to examine electrospinnability
in terms of blend MW, in which blend MW has been calculated by weighing
each component MW with its weight fraction. Figure 8 reveals that at low average blend MW, the
only structures formed are beads; as the average blend MW increases,
fiber formation becomes more and more pronounced, going from thicker
to thinner in diameter with increase in the MW (Figure 8, Table S2). Finally,
we observe that for higher MW samples in the order of 102 kDa, the predominant nanostructure obtained is a mixture of beads
and nanofibers. Note that Table S2 in the Supporting Information presents more details on the composition of the
different blends and their MWs.

Figure 8 Effect of the NG content on blend MW.

Figure 8 seems to
suggest that there may be a window for obtaining nanofibers in terms
of MW and NG composition, that is, the NG content between 0.4 and
0.7 wt % and blend MW between 50 and 100 kDa with the total polymer
content in the intermediate range. This NG content-blend MW window
may explain why blend B2 (Table 1) has similar fiber diameter to that of the sample
with 57.3 kDa MW (blend 2, Table 1; also Table S2). Blend
B2 has an NG composition of 0.4 wt % and a blend MW of ∼56
kDa, putting it in the same approximate location in Figure 8 with blend 2 that has a MW
of 57.3 kDa. An interesting feature to note from Figure 8 is that we are creating nanofibers
of nonelectrospinnable SF by adding small amounts of NG to it. This
is reminiscent of the idea of using associative polymers such as guar
and hydrophobically modified comb-like polymers to facilitate electrospinning
of non- or poorly electrospinnable systems.49 Further analysis of the blends will be part of our subsequent work
to understand the effect of solution composition on its electrospinnability.

3 Conclusions
In this study, we established
an approach to electrospin nanofibers
of guar galactomannan by blending high MW NG with its hydrolyzed low
MW analogue. The ability to obtain nanofibers of blends of the same
material without resorting to the use of a second electrospinnable
polymer is particularly beneficial in food and pharmaceutical applications,
where the presence of a second polymer may be an impediment. The approach
described here to fabricate nanofibers from the blends of otherwise
nonelectrospinnable biopolymers can be easily applied to other biopolymers
that are hard to electrospin, such as pectin and locust bean gum.
We found that neither the native high MW guar nor the hydrolyzed low
MW guar was electrospinnable at the conditions we used; however, their
combination provided a synergistic effect leading to formation of
nanofibers, while the composition and concentration of the blend dictated
its electrospinnability. Furthermore, the change in viscosity when
measured against increasing blend concentration for a specific blend
composition underwent a two-stage increase with two different slopes,
with the critical concentration at the intersection point separating
the region of electrospinnability from the region of nonelectrospinnability.
Such a critical concentration has been established before for pure
polymers but not for blends, suggesting the universality of the approach
in determining regimes for nanofiber formation.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Materials
NG gum used in this study
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. The polymer was supplied in
the form of a dry, yellow powder and was purified and lyophilized
prior to use. The MW of NG was determined to be ∼2 × 106 Da by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). PVA (MW ≈
200 000) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and was used as received.
Commercially available enzymatically degraded guar, called Sunfiber
R (abbreviated as SF henceforth), with a MW of ∼1.6 ×
104 Da (measured using GPC) was obtained from Taiyo International,
Inc. and was used as received. Sodium azide was added to all guar
solutions to serve as a bactericide and was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich,
USA.

4.2 Sample Preparation
NG gum was purified
in bulk to remove all the particles that are insoluble in water. According
to previously published protocols on guar purification,10,12 solutions of guar were prepared by sprinkling guar powder slowly
into a vortex of deionized water created with a Fisher Dynamix mixer
to the concentration of 10 g/L, mixed vigorously for 2 h followed
by magnetic stirring overnight. The resulting solution was centrifuged
at 10 000g for 30 min, and the supernatant
was collected and mixed with two volumes of ethanol. Guar precipitates
in the ethanol/water mixture, and the precipitate was collected and
lyophilized at 100 mTorr for 48 h. Afterward, dried guar was crushed
to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle and was stored in a desiccator
until used. A 1 wt % solution of the purified guar was prepared in
deionized water to which 0.2 mg/mL sodium azide was added as the bactericide.
PVA solutions were made by adding the desired amount of PVA pellets
to deionized water and left to stir overnight in a 60 °C oil
bath. Solution of the lower MW guar, SF, was prepared in the same
manner as mentioned above but without any purification. Prior to mixing
with NG, SF was dissolved in deionized water at increasing concentrations
until the solution was saturated at room temperature at ∼47
wt %. All guar solutions were prepared overnight to allow the guar
powder to swell and dissolve slowly and uniformly and were then stored
at 4 °C until use to prevent degradation. All rheology and electrospinning
experiments were carried out within three weeks of solution preparation
to avoid polymer degradation.

4.3 Solution
Characterization
Rheological
experiments were conducted with a Discovery Hybrid Rheometer (DHR3)
(TA Instruments, New Castle, DE) using a 4 cm, 1° cone-and-plate
geometry. All experiments, unless specified, were performed at room
temperature. Because the steady shear response of guar and guar blend
solutions is sensitive to shear history, a pre-shear was applied at
a strain rate of 5 s–1 for 180 s followed by a rest
period of 120 s, as already reported in the literature.49 Zero-shear viscosity measurements were conducted
over a range of shear stresses (between 0.1 and 100 Pa), with every
measurement taken in triplicates to ensure reproducibility within
±5%.

Surface tension of the solutions was measured using
the pendent drop method with the help of a First Ten Angstroms Goniometer.
An average volume of 5 μL was used to determine surface tension
of the respective solutions at 25 °C. Conductivity of the solutions
was measured with the help of a Thermo Scientific Orion Star Conductivity
Meter at an average temperature of 25 °C. All the measurements
were conducted in triplicates.

4.4 Electrospinning
The electrospinning
setup consisted of an aluminum collector plate, a precision syringe
pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), and a high-voltage power
supply (Gamma High Voltage Research, model D-ES30 PN/M692 with a positive
polarity). The syringe pump controlled the flow of polymer solution
loaded in a 10 mL syringe to a stainless-steel capillary metal hub
needle (22 gauge) which was connected to the positive electrode of
the power supply. The collector plate was grounded, and the fibers
were collected on aluminum foil wrapped on the collector plate. The
electrospinning parameters were adjusted to obtain a stable Taylor
cone during the electrospinning process. The flow rate was changed
from 0.1 to 1 mL/h, voltage was varied from 5 to 15 kV, and the tip-to-collector
distance was varied from 5 to 20 cm. All experiments were conducted
at 45 ± 3% relative humidity. While the role of humidity in electrospinning
can be interesting,50 we defer this topic
for a future study.

4.5 Nanofiber Characterization
Fiber
morphology was analyzed by SEM with a FEI XL30 microscope with a field
emission gun operated under high vacuum at 5 kV. Because our polymers
are nonconductive, the nanofiber mats were sputter-coated with a thin
film of gold with a Denton Vacuum Desk IV sputter coater prior to
imaging to prevent charging. The average fiber diameter was determined
by measuring diameters of 100 individual fibers from multiple SEM
images using ImageJ software.
