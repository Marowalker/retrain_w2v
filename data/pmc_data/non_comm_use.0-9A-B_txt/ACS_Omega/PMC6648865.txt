Herein, a magnetically
separable reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-supported
CoFe2O4–TiO2 photocatalyst
was developed by a simple ultrasound-assisted wet impregnation method
for efficient photocatalytic H2 production. Integration
of CoFe2O4 with TiO2 induced the
formation of Ti3+ sites that remarkably reduced the optical
band gap of TiO2 to 2.80 eV from 3.20 eV. Moreover, the
addition of rGO improved the charge carrier separation by forming
Ti–C bonds. Importantly, the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalyst demonstrated significantly enhanced photocatalytic
H2 production compared to that from its individual counterparts
such as TiO2 and CoFe2O4–TiO2, respectably. A maximum H2 production rate of
76 559 μmol g–1 h–1 was achieved with a 20 wt % CoFe2O4- and 1
wt % rGO-loaded TiO2 photocatalyst, which was approximately
14-fold enhancement when compared with the bare TiO2. An
apparent quantum yield of 12.97% at 400 nm was observed for the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalyst under
optimized reaction conditions. This remarkable enhancement can be
attributed to synergistically improved charge carrier separation through
Ti3+ sites and rGO support, viz., Ti–C bonds. The
recyclability of the photocatalyst was ascertained over four consecutive
cycles, indicating the stability of the photocatalyst. In addition,
it is worth mentioning that the photocatalyst could be easily separated
after the reaction using a simple magnet. Thus, we believe that this
study may open a new way to prepare low-cost, noble-metal-free magnetic
materials with TiO2 for sustainable photocatalytic H2 production.

1 Introduction
In
response to ever increasing global energy demand and the environmental
concerns due to the rapid development and population growth, it becomes
necessary and urgent to develop a renewable, clean, cost-effective,
and sustainable source of energy.1 The
fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) remain the main source of
energy because of their availability and low cost. However, they have
several environmental issues, such as the greenhouse effect, global
warming, etc. Moreover, fossil fuel resources are finite, depleted
rapidly, and cannot be recovered. Extensive research has been carried
out to find alternative sources of energy. One of the most promising
options is solar energy conversion into hydrogen energy via the water
splitting process.1 The solar hydrogen
production through photocatalytic water splitting is considered as
the most viable approach to address the global energy crisis.2 Especially, photocatalytic water splitting by
employing a photocatalyst has shown a great potential because of its
low cost and clean and highly sustainable future for solar hydrogen
evolution. Over the past few decades, designing highly efficient,
scalable, and stable photocatalysts for solar water splitting has
been a great challenge.3,4 Many photocatalysts, such as ZnO,
CdS, SnO2, g-C3N4, and TiO2, are suffering from poor charge carrier separation and transfer,
photocorrosion, and photostability, having a band gap in the UV region;
therefore, they hinder photocatalysis for commercial viability.5−9 Enormous progress has been made to address these problems by doping
metal, loading carbon material (reduced graphene oxide (rGO), carbon
nanotube (CNT)), and designing heterojunction nanocomposite photocatalysts.10,11 Among these, constructing a heterojunction nanocomposite is a promising
approach to obtain high-performance photocatalysts.

TiO2 is one of the most efficient and promising photocatalysts
for the water-splitting application owing to its nontoxicity, low
cost, photoactivity, and high chemical stability.12,13 Nevertheless, despite being a good photocatalyst, the low efficiency
and the wide band gap (∼3.20 eV) of TiO2 hinder
its visible light absorption along with its photocatalytic performance.14 Furthermore, a high charge carrier recombination
also reduces the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2. To
date, several efforts have been made to overcome such problems; among
them, the construction of heterojunction with other photocatalysts
and also carbon materials, such as TiO2–Cu2O/rGO,15 g-C3N4–TiO2/rGO,16 AgI–meso TiO2/rGO,17 MWCT–TiO2/rGO,18 CuFe2O4–TiO2/rGO,19 and Ag2O–TiO2,20 has shown efficient charge
carrier separation and transfer, resulting in improved photocatalytic
performance.

In general, it is a very difficult task to remove
or settle the
catalyst after the reaction in heterogeneous catalysis. A useful strategy
was proposed by integration of a TiO2-based photocatalyst
with magnetic materials such as, CuFe2O4, CoFe2O4, and so on.19,21 In particular,
cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) with a spinel structure
has attracted significant attention for a variety of applications
including photodegradation of organic pollutants and water splitting
because of its visible-light-responsive photocatalytic activity, low
band gap, nontoxicity, corrosion resistance, and chemical stability
in aqueous solution, apart from its magnetic property.22,23 Chang et al. reported that the CoFe2O4@ZnS
photocatalyst fabricated for 0.5 h (ZnS growth time) achieved a H2 production rate of 1650 μmol g–1 h–1.24 Chen et al. also reported
that g-C3N4 modified with CoFe2O4 exhibited almost 3 times increment in H2 production
activity in comparison with pure g-C3N4, with
an apparent quantum yield of 3.5%.25 However,
the low conduction band potential compared with the redox hydrogen
potential makes CoFe2O4 an inferior photocatalyst
toward photocatalytic water splitting, but it can be used as a photosensitizer.26,27

Several attempts have been carried out to improve the photocatalytic
performance of metal oxides and ferrites, such as incorporation of
graphene, carbon nanotube (CNT), and fullerene.15,18,26,27 Graphene is
a two-dimensional layer of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms
and has become highly attractive in different applications like sensors,
supercapacitors, and catalysis because of its unique properties of
a high specific surface area and faster carrier mobility.28,29 Graphene oxide (GO) is produced through the oxidation of graphite
powder and can be reduced to reduced graphene oxide (rGO) by considerably
removing the oxygen functional groups (epoxy) using chemical methods.30−32 Various reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-based photocatalysts, such
as MWCT–TiO2/rGO,18 MoS2–TiO2/rGO,33 TiO2-Cu2O/rGO,15 and NS-rGO/TiO2,34 have been shown to improve
the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency. This improvement
in the photocatalytic activity has been ascribed to the suppression
of electron–hole pair recombination and high electron mobility
of the rGO.

Recently, Gupta et al. have reported that loading
rGO onto the
CoFe2O4–TiO2 nanocomposite
has shown improvement in the chlorpyrifos degradation activity under
visible light.35 However, to the best of
our knowledge, there was no report documented in the literature for
the hydrogen production application. Herein, we reported, for the
first time, the synthesis of a rGO-supported CoFe2O4–TiO2 photocatalyst by the combination of
the wet impregnation and ultrasound methods for the photocatalytic
water splitting. The CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalysts exhibited exceptional photocatalytic activity
in water splitting to generate hydrogen compared with the pure TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs). It is worth mentioning here that loading
CoFe2O4 and rGO onto TiO2 drastically
enhanced the H2 production rate to 76559 μmol g–1 h–1, which is the second among
all of the rGO- and TiO2-based photocatalysts.

2 Results and Discussion
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of the prepared pristine TiO2, CoFe2O4, CoFe2O4–TiO2, and CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalysts are
shown in Figure 1.
From the XRD results, it is found that
GO exhibits two peaks at 2θ = 9.8 and 42.5°, corresponding
to the (001) and (002) planes, respectively. The diffraction peaks
observed at 2θ = 18.2, 30.1, 35.5, 37.1, 43.1, 53.4, 56.9, and
62.6° correspond to the (111), (220), (311), (222), (400), (422),
(511), and (440) crystallographic planes of CoFe2O4 (JCPDS Card no. 22-1086), respectively.36 Pristine TiO2 shows two different phases, i.e.,
at 25.3, 37.8, 48.0, 53.9, 55.1, 62.7, 69.7, 75.6, and 83.0°,
which are assigned to the (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204),
(220), (215) and (312) crystal planes of the anatase phase (JCPDS
21-1272), respectively,37 and at 30.8 and
42.3°, which are assigned to the (121) and (221) crystallographic
planes of the brookite phase of TiO2 (JCPDS 29-1360).38 The weight fraction ratio of the anatase to
the brookite phase, according to integrated intensities of the anatase
(101) plane at 2θ = 25.3° and the brookite (121) plane
at 2θ = 30.8°, was found to be ∼63:37, which is
the benefit of the photocatalyst in improving photocatalytic activity.38 The XRD pattern confirms the presence of multiphases
(CoFe2O4 and anatase/brookite TiO2) in the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO
photocatalyst. However, the peak attributed to the rGO is not visible,
possibly due to overlapping with the (101) diffraction peak of anatase
TiO2 or low loading of rGO (1 wt %).39

Figure 1 XRD patterns of GO, TiO2, CoFe2O4, and CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalysts.

Figure 2 displays
the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of GO, CoFe2O4, TiO2, CoFe2O4–TiO2, and CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalysts. GO exhibits the characteristic peak at 3432
cm–1, corresponding to the O–H stretching,
whereas the peaks appearing at 1715, 1622, 1397, 1233, and 1057 cm–1 are related to the stretching vibration (C=O),
aromatic carbon vibration (C=C), bending in carboxylic and
carbonyl (O–H) groups, vibration of epoxy groups (C–O),
and stretching vibration of alkoxy groups (C–O), respectively.40 For pristine TiO2, the IR peaks observed
at 3432, 1626, and 1368 cm–1 can be ascribed to
the stretching vibration mode of O–H and bonding modes of Ti–OH
and Ti–O, respectively,41,42 whereas the broad band
at 900–400 cm–1 is related to bulk titanate.43 CoFe2O4 NPs show two broad
bands at 410 and 586 cm–1, which are assigned to
the intrinsic stretching vibrations of the metal at the tetrahedral
site and octahedral metal stretching, respectively.44,45 The broad band at 400–800 cm–1 observed
for CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO can be
ascribed to the Ti–O–Ti, Ti–O-C, or Fe–O
stretching vibrations. The peak intensities of GO functional groups
are significantly less in CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalysts, indicating the reduction of GO during
calcination. In the FTIR spectra of the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalyst, all of the IR peaks of
both CoFe2O4 and TiO2 are present,
which are in accordance with the XRD and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) results.

Figure 2 FTIR spectra of GO, TiO2, CoFe2O4, CoFe2O4–TiO2, and
CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalysts.

The Raman spectra of pristine
TiO2, CoFe2O4–TiO2, and CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalysts
are displayed in Figure 3. Pure TiO2 shows Raman peaks at about 146, 403, 521,
and 640 cm–1corresponding to the Eg(1), B1g, A1g + B1g(2), and Eg(2) modes of anatase, respectively,
whereas the peaks at 247 and 321 cm–1 are related
to the A1g and B1g modes of the brookite phase
of TiO2.16 Additional Raman
peaks appearing at 470 cm–1 (T1g(2))
and 624 cm–1 (A1g(2)) in the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalyst can
be assigned to the symmetric stretching of the Fe–Co–O
bond and the symmetric vibration mode of the metal in the octahedral
and tetrahedral sides of CoFe2O4, respectively.46,47 The Raman peak intensities of TiO2 decreased in the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalyst, which
can be due to the incorporation of CoFe2O4 and
rGO into TiO2. As seen in Figure 3 (inset), the Eg(1) mode for CoFe2O4–TiO2 and CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalysts is slightly shifted
in comparison with the pristine TiO2, indicating the coupling
of rGO and CoFe2O4 with TiO2. In
the Raman spectra of the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalyst, two characteristic peaks of graphitic
carbon (G-band) and disordered carbon (D-band) were observed at 1590
and 1298 cm–1, respectively. The ID/IG ratio of the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalyst is
found to be 1.03, which is higher than that of GO (0.93), indicating
effective reduction of GO during the thermal process.17

Figure 3 Raman spectra of TiO2, CoFe2O4–TiO2, and CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalysts.

Figure S1a,b displays the scanning
electron
microscopy (SEM) images of the pure TiO2 and CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalysts. As seen
in Figure S1a,b, TiO2 exhibits
irregular-shaped and agglomerated morphology and CoFe2O4 NPs are well dispersed on the surface of TiO2 NPs,
respectively. The purity of the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalyst was verified by the energy-dispersive spectrometry
(EDS) spectrum (Figure S1c), and the corresponding
wt % results are shown in the table in the inset of Figure S1c. Figure 4 shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of
the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalyst.
As seen from the TEM image in Figure 4a, CoFe2O4–TiO2 photocatalysts are well dispersed and anchored on the rGO sheets
with an average particle size of 35.2 nm as seen in the inset of Figure 4a. The high-resolution
(HR)-TEM image of the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalysts is displayed in Figure 4b, which clearly discloses the interface
formation between CoFe2O4 and TiO2. The lattice fringes with d-spacings
of 0.35 and 0.26 nm correspond to the TiO2(101) and CoFe2O4(311) planes, respectively.34 The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED)
patterns of the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalyst are shown in Figure 4c. The diffraction rings could be ascribed
to the (121) crystalline plane of brookite, the (101) and (220) planes
of the anatase phase TiO2, and the (311) plane of cobalt
ferrite. The SAED patterns further confirm the crystallinity of CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalysts, which
are in good accordance with the XRD patterns.

CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalyst,

pattern of the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalyst.

Figure 5 displays
the absorption and the Tauc plots of the TiO2, CoFe2O4, CoFe2O4–TiO2, and CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalysts.48 According to Figure 5a, the absorption
band of the pristine TiO2 is at 388 nm, which corresponds
to a band gap energy of 3.20 eV (Figure 5b), whereas CoFe2O4 with a black surface shows a broad absorption range from 200 to
1000 nm. After loading of 20 wt % CoFe2O4, the
absorption edge of TiO2 is red-shifted from 388 to 419
nm with a band gap of 2.96 eV. Similarly, after incorporation 1 wt
% rGO, the absorption edge further shifted to 443 nm, corresponding
to a band gap of 2.80 eV. It is clear evidence that rGO not only is
a solid support but also interacts chemically with the metal (Ti),
thereby reducing the band gap energy of TiO2, which further
enhances the charge carrier separation and transfer.49,50 The diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) results clearly show
the incorporation of CoFe2O4 and rGO into TiO2 shifts the absorption intensity of TiO2 in
the visible region by narrowing the band gap, which results from the
formation of defect sites, such as Ti3+ and oxygen vacancies
(Ov), addition of CoFe2O4 and Ti–C
bond formation, thereby light absorbance increase, and more efficient
utilization of light could be obtained, resulting in an increased
photocatalytic performance of TiO2.49−51

reflectance spectra and (b) Tauc plots
of TiO2, CoFe2O4, CoFe2O4–TiO2, and CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalysts.

The chemical and electronic structures of the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalysts are examined
by
XPS. The peak signals for Fe, Co, O, C, and Ti are observed in the
survey scan of the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalysts, as seen in Figure 6a. As shown in Figure 6b, C 1s displays four asymmetric peaks at
284.6, 285.8, 287.3, and 289.2 eV related to the aromatic ring (C=C/C–C),
hydroxyl and epoxy groups (C–O), carbonyl groups (C=O),
and carboxyl groups (C(O)O), respectively.52 The O 1s spectrum (Figure 6c) exhibits peaks at 530.4 and 532.7 eV related to the lattice
oxygen in Ti–O–Ti and/or crystal lattice oxygen (oxygen
bonded to the metal) in CoFe2O4 and oxygen in
the Ti–OH bonds, respectively.53,54 Additionally,
the Fe 2p spectrum (Figure 6d) shows two peaks, Fe 2p3/2 (710.2 eV) and Fe
2p1/2 (725.0 eV).55 The deconvolution
of Co 2p is depicted in Figure 6e. The peaks at 797.0 and 780.1 eV are related to Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2, respectively. The main Co 2p3/2 peak has two satellite peaks at 786.7 and 790.1 eV, which
are ascribed to Co2+ in octahedral and tetrahedral sites,
respectively. The intense Co 2p1/2 satellite peak at 803.0
eV confirms the presence of Co2+ species in the photocatalyst.56 The XPS spectrum of Ti 2p (Figure 6f) displays two peaks: Ti 2p3/2 (458.7 eV) and Ti 2p1/2 (464.6 eV).57 The peaks appearing at 457.3 and 463.0 eV correspond
to the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks of Ti3+, indicating that Ti3+ species were formed as
a result of the reaction of free carbon with oxygen in air on the
surface of TiO2, which favors oxygen in the lattice of
TiO2, resulting in the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) and the low valence state of Ti3+.49 Importantly, Ti3+ and Ov could act as an electron trapping center, which largely inhibit
electron–hole pair recombination, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic
activity. Notably, additional peaks appearing at 455.0 and 461.1 eV
related to the Ti–C bond were observed, indicating the existence
of chemical bonding between TiO2 and rGO sheets.58 The formation of Ti–C bond could also
extend light absorption of TiO2 to the visible region.59 The XPS results further revealed the phase purity
of the photocatalysts and bonding of rGO and TiO2 in the
photocatalysts.

spectra of (b) C 1s (c) O 1s (d) Fe 2p (e) Co 2p, and (f) Ti 2p.

The photoluminescence (PL) spectra
of pure TiO2, CoFe2O4–TiO2, CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO
photocatalysts are displayed in Figure 7. The PL emission
spectra of bare TiO2 show several peaks at 417, 440, 447,
and 465  nm. The observed peak at 417 nm is related to the band
gap transition, whereas those at 440 and 447 nm are assigned to the
defect sites including surface oxygen vacancies (Ov) and
Ti3+ presence in TiO2 NPs.60−62 The peak at
465  nm is assigned to the free excitation emission of the band
gap.60 After incorporating CoFe2O4 on the TiO2 surface, the PL emission intensity
is significantly reduced, indicating lower charge carrier recombination.
Furthermore, a significant PL quenching was observed when rGO was
added to CoFe2O4–TiO2 photocatalysts.
Indeed, the effect of rGO on the charge carrier separation was phenomenal
and also revealed that rGO hindered or suppressed electron–hole
pair recombination, which improved photocatalytic activity.49

Figure 7 PL spectra of TiO2, CoFe2O4–TiO2, and CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalysts.

The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a promising
method that is used to study the charge separation and transfer behavior
of a photocatalyst.63 In general, a bigger
arc radius of the Nyquist circle indicates a higher charge-transfer
resistance. Figure S2 displays the Nyquist
circle of TiO2, CoFe2O4–TiO2, and CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalysts measured under simulated solar light irradiation.
The larger arc radius for TiO2 suggests a higher charge-transfer
resistance compared to that of CoFe2O4–TiO2 and CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO
photocatalysts. As shown in Figure S2,
the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO ternary
photocatalyst exhibited a smaller arc radius than that of CoFe2O4–TiO2.64,65 The results indicated that loading rGO significantly improved the
electron mobility, thereby suppressing the charge-transfer resistance.
This result is in accordance with the above PL results. Figure S3 shows the photocurrent study of TiO2, CoFe2O4–TiO2, and
CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalysts.
The CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO ternary
photocatalyst gave higher photocurrent response compared to that of
bare TiO2 and CoFe2O4–TiO2. This higher photocurrent response produced by the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalyst can
be related to the high electron mobility of rGO at the interfaces
of the CoFe2O4 and TiO2 heterojunction
that greatly enhances migration and efficient charge carrier separation,
which is in accordance with PL and EIS studies. These results are
also consistent with the previous studies reported by Babu and Jiang et
al.15,66

The magnetic separation performance
of the prepared photocatalysts
was further studied. Figure 8 displays the magnetic hysteresis loop of CoFe2O4 and CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalysts, in which CoFe2O4 shows
a symmetric hysteresis loop with a higher magnetization saturation
value of ∼36.5 emu g–1 compared to that of
the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalyst
(∼5.9 emu g–1). This low magnetization saturation
value is related to the presence of the nonmagnetic TiO2 and rGO. It still can be separated from the reaction solution using
a simple magnet as seen in the inset of Figure 8. Furthermore, Figure 8 (inset) clearly reveals that the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalyst retains
its magnetic separation performance after four consecutive cycles
and can be a promising magnetic photocatalyst material. The above
results demonstrated that the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalyst has good stability and recyclability during
the photocatalytic reaction.

The photocatalytic H2 production activities of
prepared
photocatalysts were determined for water splitting under UV–vis
light irradiation with glycerol as a hole scavenger. As depicted in Figure 9, the relative order
of H2 production for the photocatalysts is P-25 TiO2 (methanol, 2772 μmol g–1 h–1) < P-25 TiO2 (glycerol, 4739 μmol g–1 h–1) < TiO2 (5336 μmol g–1 h–1) < rGO/TiO2 (9421
μmol g–1 h–1) < CoFe2O4–TiO2 (16 673 μmol
g–1 h–1) < CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO (76 559 μmol
g–1 h–1). The photocatalytic H2 production rate achieved using present TiO2 NPs
was 1.13 and 1.92 times higher than that of the commercially available
TiO2 Degussa P-25 using glycerol and methanol, respectively.
Moreover, the ternary CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalyst exhibits almost 8-fold increment of H2 production activity compared to that of the binary TiO2/rGO photocatalyst (Figure 9). To understand the effects of CoFe2O4 loading on hydrogen production, different wt % of CoFe2O4 (10, 20, 30, and 40 wt %) were loaded onto TiO2, resulting in an increased H2 production activity
till 20 wt %, which then decreases. The optimized sample (20 wt %)
produced 16 673 μmol g–1 h–1 hydrogen (Figure 10), which is almost 3-fold higher than that from the bare TiO2. As shown in Figure 11, rGO plays a prominent role in boosting the H2 production activity of the as-prepared photocatalysts. After incorporation
of different wt % of rGO (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 wt %) in the CoFe2O4–TiO2 photocatalyst, a further
enhancement in the H2 evolution rate is observed (Figure 11). Surprisingly,
a remarkable photocatalytic H2 production rate of 76 559
μmol g–1 h–1 is achieved
with the optimized 1.0 wt % rGO in CoFe2O4–TiO2 that exceeds 14.4-folds higher than that of the bare TiO2. An apparent quantum yield of 12.97% at 400 nm was observed
for the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalyst
under optimized reaction conditions. This superior photocatalytic
performance of the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalyst is associated with the existence of defect sites
(Ti3+ and Ov), Ti–C bond formation, and
effective formation of heterojunction between CoFe2O4 and TiO2, which efficiently facilitate the rapid
interfacial charge transfer in the presence of rGO matrix.49,58 Furthermore, the photocatalytic H2 evolution achieved
in the present study is significantly higher than already reported
results, as depicted in Table S1. To determine
the recyclability and durability of the optimized CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalyst, four consecutive
cycles of photocatalytic reaction were carried out. Each cycle was
performed for 4 h under UV–visible irradiation. At the end
of every cycle, the reactor solution was entirely wrapped with an
aluminum foil and kept overnight in the dark. The reactor solution
was evacuated, purged with N2 gas, and then placed on a
magnetic stirrer under UV–visible irradiation for another reaction.
A similar trend was followed up to four cycles. No significant loss
of photocatalytic activity was observed for the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalyst up to four cycles,
as shown in Figure 12. A minor decrease in the photocatalytic activity in the fourth cycle
is observed, which can be attributed to a decrease of glycerol concentration
in the solution because of the decomposition of glycerol.

The improved photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared
CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalyst
can
be attributed to the combination of visible light sensitization, formation
of a p–n heterojunction, presence of defect sites (Ti3+ and Ov), and synergistic effect of the rGO support layer.
Based on the above results, it is undoubtedly proved that the formation
of a p–n heterojunction, defect sites, and rGO support is the
important factor to enhance the photocatalytic performance of the
photocatalyst. The conduction band (ECB) and valence band (EVB) positions of
the photocatalysts were computed theoretically by the following empirical
formulas (eqs 1 and 2)67,68 1   2  

where ECB and EVB represent the conduction
and valence band potentials of
a photocatalyst, respectively. χ is the electronegativity of
the photocatalyst (the χ values for CoFe2O4 and TiO2 are 5.81 and 5.81 eV, respectively69,70), Ec represents the energy of free electrons
on the hydrogen scale (∼4.5 eV), and Eg stands for the band-gap energy of the photocatalyst. Thus,
the band-gap energies of TiO2 and CoFe2O4 were found to be 3.20 and 1.38 eV, respectively (Figure 5b). Table 1 shows the calculated values
of EVB and ECB for CoFe2O4 and TiO2 using eqs 1 and 2, respectively.

Table 1 Electronegativity, Band Gap, and Conduction
Band and
Valance Band Positions of the Photocatalysts on NHE
photocatalyst	χ (eV)	Eg (eV)	ECB (eV)	EVB (eV)	
CoFe2O4	5.81	1.38	+0.62	+2.00	
TiO2	5.81	3.20	–0.29	+2.91	
To understand the charge-transfer
mechanism of TiO2 and
CoFe2O4 over the rGO-supported photocatalyst,
a plausible energy-level diagram for the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalyst system is constructed,
as depicted in Figure 13. On the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), the ECB edges of TiO2 and CoFe2O4 were calculated to be −0.29 and +0.62, respectively, and
the corresponding EVB edges are at +2.91
and +2.00 eV, respectively (Table 1). The Fermi level (EF)
of n-type TiO2 is below ECB, whereas that of p-type CoFe2O4 is above EVB.71 Before contact,
the ECB position of TiO2 is
higher than that of CoFe2O4 and the EF of TiO2 is above that of CoFe2O4, as depicted in Figure 13a. When these two photocatalysts are in
contact, the EF of CoFe2O4 moves up, whereas the EF of TiO2 moves down, until the EF’s
of TiO2 and CoFe2O4 get the same
value. A p–n heterojunction is formed at the interface, and
the electron transfer occurs from CoFe2O4 to
TiO2 until it reached thermal equilibrium, resulting in
the formation of the space charge region. The TiO2 and
CoFe2O4 bands do bend, and the whole energy
level of CoFe2O4 rises, whereas that of TiO2 descends.72,73 As a result, the ECB position of CoFe2O4 is higher
than that of TiO2. Hence, the electrons can easily transfer
from ECB of CoFe2O4 to ECB of TiO2 because of
band bending. It was reported previously that the existence of Ti3+ and Ov induced new localized states below the
CB of TiO2, which is responsible for the decrease of band
gap of TiO2.74,75 The excess electrons
accumulated in the ECB of TiO2 and the electrons present in the defect sites (Ti3+ and
Ov) are mediated via the rGO surface and reduce protons
(H+) to produce H2, as shown in Figure 13b.49,74 Therefore, the formed defect sites (Ti3+ and Ov) substantially suppress the charge carrier recombination rate and
extend the visible light absorption, thereby enhancing the H2 production efficiency.76 The photogenerated
holes can easily transfer from the higher EVB of TiO2 (+2.91 eV) to the lower EVB of CoFe2O4 (+2.00 eV), where they
do react with glycerol to generate an intermediate product and CO2. Thus, this providential increase in hydrogen production
performance can be related to the presence of defect sites (Ti3+ and Ov) and Ti–C bond formation, which
efficiently extend the photoresponse of TiO2 to the visible
region.

light irradiation of the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalyst.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a magnetic material
CoFe2O4 and
TiO2 photocatalysts along with reduced graphene oxide (rGO)
as a support were prepared by a simple ultrasound-assisted wet impregnation
method. A superior hydrogen production activity was achieved for the
optimized magnetic material CoFe2O4 (20 wt %)
and rGO (1 wt %) loaded on the TiO2 surface. The effect
of rGO loading was phenomenal in the present study and exhibited maximum
H2 production rate of 76 559 μmol g– h–1, which is ∼5- and ∼14-fold enhancement
compared to that of CoFe2O4–TiO2 and the bare TiO2, respectively. This remarkable enhancement
was related to the addition of CoFe2O4, presence
of defect sites (Ti3+ and Ov), and strong interaction
between rGO sheets and TiO2 through Ti–C bond formation,
which were responsible for the synergistic effect. The XPS and PL
studies undoubtedly proved the existence of defect sites (Ti3+ and Ov) and Ti–C bond in the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalysts. Furthermore, a
substantial reduction in PL emission intensity and the high transient
photocurrent response further supported high transfer efficiency and
the charge carrier separation in the presence of rGO sheet, resulting
in the superior photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the photocatalyst
showed good stability and can easily be separated after the reaction
using a simple magnet.

4 Experimental Details
4.1 Materials
Graphite powder (99.9995%) and cobalt nitrate
hexahydrate and iron nitrate nonahydrate, citric acid, and graphite
powder were procured from Alfa Aesar and Merck, India, respectively.
Titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) and commercially available solvents
such as ethanol, methanol, and isopropanol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
SRL and Rankem, India, respectively.

4.2 Characterization
Studies
The crystal phase of the as-synthesized
photocatalysts was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (PANalytical X’pert
powder diffractometer) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406
Å). The morphologies of the photocatalysts were recorded on a
transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM 2100F, accelerating
voltage of 200 kV). HR-TEM was used to record the size and shape of
the as-synthesized photocatalysts. Field emission-scanning electron
microscopy images were obtained using a FEI Quanta FEG 200 HR-SEM.
UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) measurements
were performed with a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV–vis spectrophotometer
in DRS mode. The chemical and elemental compositions of the photocatalyst
were identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using Al
Kα instruments, as a source at 1350 eV. Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy was performed using a Perkin Elmer spectrometer.
Raman spectra were examined by Bruker IFS 66V/FRA 106. Photoluminescence
(PL) spectra of photocatalysts were analyzed by a JASCO FP-6300 fluorescence
spectrometer.

4.3 Fabrication of the CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO Photocatalyst
4.3.1 Synthesis of TiO2 NPs
In typical synthesis,
TiO2 NPs were prepared as reported previously.16 Isopropanol (15 mL) and titanium tetraisopropoxide
(5 mL) were slowly added into 250 mL of deionized (DI) water at pH
∼ 3, under vigorous stirring, respectively. A white precipitate
was formed, which was stirred for another 2 h and then kept in the
oven for 22 h at 60 °C. The precipitate was collected and centrifuged
seven times with DI water. The resultant sample was dried overnight
at 80 °C followed by calcination for 2 h at 400 °C. The
photocatalyst was labeled as Ti.

4.3.2 Synthesis
of CoFe2O4 NPs
CoFe2O4 NPs were prepared via the precipitation method.77 In a typical synthesis, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (2.0 g) and Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.73 g) were put into a glass beaker with
50 mL of deionized (DI) water. The mixture was dissolved after stirring
for 10 min and, separately, citric acid (1.44 g) was dissolved in
50 mL of DI water. Then, the above solution was mixed and sonicated
for 20 min followed by vigorous stirring for 3 h. The pH was maintained
at 9 by adding dilute NaOH. A brown precipitate was formed, which
was further stirred for 3 h at 80 °C. A dark brown gel was collected,
which was centrifuged five times with DI water, dried overnight at
70 °C, and then calcined at 550 °C for 2 h. The photocatalyst
was labeled as CF.

4.3.3 Synthesis of CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO Photocatalysts
GO was prepared through a modified Hummer’s
method as reported in a previous report.15 The CoFe2O4–TiO2/rGO photocatalyst
was fabricated by the ultrasound-assisted wet impregnation method,
as shown in Scheme 1. Different amounts of GO (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 wt %) were added
to a beaker containing the ethanol–water mixture. Then, the
solution was sonicated for 1 h followed by addition of TiO2 under stirring for 3 h. A different weight percentage of CoFe2O4 (10, 20, 30, and 40 wt %) was loaded onto the
above solution under vigorous stirring for 4 h. Finally, the samples
were washed five times with DI water and dried at 70 °C for 12
h, followed by calcination for 2 h at 400 °C. The samples were
labeled as CTR-0.5, CTR-1, CTR-2, and CTR-3. The same trend was adopted
to synthesize the CoFe2O4–TiO2 photocatalyst without GO, and the photocatalysts were labeled as
CT-10, CT-20, CT-30, and CT-40.

Scheme 1 4.4 Hydrogen
Production Test
The photocatalytic H2 production
experiment was carried out in a glass reactor (135 mL)
closed with a rubber septum. A xenon lamp (250 W) was used as a light
source. Then, 5.0 mg of photocatalyst was added into 50 mL of glycerol–water
(5/45 v/v) solution. The mixture was magnetically stirred in the dark
under N2 purging for 30 min to ensure adsorption–desorption
equilibrium. Then, the sample solution was irradiated under the light
source. The H2 gas produced was evaluated using a gas chromatograph
(Shimadzu GC-2014; nitrogen as a carrier gas). The apparent quantum
efficiency (AQY) of the prepared photocatalyst was calculated as shown
in Section S1.

4.5 Photoelectrochemical
Studies
All of the electrochemical
measurements were performed in an electrochemical workstation (CHI608E)
using the traditional three-electrode experimental system: glassy
carbon electrode (area 0.385 mm2), Pt, and Ag/AgCl were
utilized as the working, counter, and the reference electrodes, respectively.
A 300 W xenon lamp (OSRAM, Germany) was employed as the source of
light, and 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution as
an electrolyte. Then, 2.5 mg of the photocatalyst was dispersed in
250 μL of ethanol and 5 μL of Nafion and then ultrasonicated
for 1 h to form a slurry solution. The slurry was dip-coated onto
a precleaned working electrode. After air-drying, the prepared photoelectrode
was immersed in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution.
