Intracellular fluorescence
lifetime and intensity images of the
endogenous fluorophore of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)
have been observed before and after application of nanosecond pulsed
electric field (nsPEF) in normal and cancer cells, that is, in Wistar-King-Aptekman
rat fetus fibroblast (WFB) cells and W31 cells, which are the malignant
transformed cells from WFB. The application of nsPEF induces a change
both in intensity and lifetime of NADH, indicating that the intracellular
function is affected by application of nsPEF in both normal and cancer
cells. The application of nsPEF induces an increase in the fluorescence
lifetime of NADH and a morphological change, which is attributed to
the induction of apoptosis by nsPEF. The field effect on the intensity
and lifetime clearly depends on the pulse width, and magnitude of
the field-induced increase in the fluorescence lifetime of NADH has
a tendency to increase with a decreasing pulse width. It is also found
that apoptosis can be induced only in cancer cells using a suitable
nsPEF, showing a possibility that ultrashort pulsed electric field
is applicable for drug-free cancer therapy.

Introduction
Cancer research is
of great interest in many scientific disciplines,
not only in biological and medical sciences but also in chemical and
spectroscopic sciences. Research in the latter has rapidly advanced
the understanding of biological insights and its translation into
better cancer detection and therapy.1−5 The metabolic differences between normal and cancer cells result
in different circumstances of coenzymes, which are strongly involved
in cell metabolism. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) is one
of the important coenzymes in cellular respiration, and both the intensity
and lifetime of autofluorescence of NADH in cells is markedly dependent
on cellular environments.6−13 NADH emits fluorescence at around 450 nm, and the autofluorescence
of NADH is widely used to examine intracellular environments.12 Intracellular differences between the cancer
and normal cells may also be proposed to be distinguished by NADH
autofluorescence.13 In the present study,
differences in the intracellular environment between normal (healthy)
and cancer cells were examined using fluorescence lifetime microscopy
(FLIM) of NADH before and after application of a nanosecond pulsed
electric field (nsPEF). FLIM is one of the more powerful methods to
perform quantitative measurements of the intracellular environment
because the fluorescence lifetime is an intrinsic parameter that is
independent of absorption intensity, excitation light intensity, or
photobleaching.14−20 The FLIM of autofluorescence is therefore a highly reliable and
less invasive method without dye staining.9−13,16

The electric-field
effect on the dynamics and function of biological
systems may depend on the cell membrane capacitance and on the pulse
duration of the applied field, which enables selective applications
of pulsed electric field in specific organelles and specific living
cells.21−23 If a pulse shorter than the charging time of the
outer membrane is applied to living systems, the pulsed electric field
may induce changes in subcellular organelles, signal proteins, and
biochemical processes, without affecting the outer plasma membrane
and organelles. For example, apoptosis is induced by the application
of nsPEF, with a pulse width of 10–50 ns and a field strength
of 40 or 45 kV cm–1 in HeLa cells.24,25 In the present study, on the basis of the pulse-height dependence
and pulse-width dependence of the field-induced change in the fluorescence
lifetime, it is shown that apoptosis of cancer cells induced by application
of pulsed electric fields is considerably more effective than that
of normal cells, suggesting that ultrashort pulsed electric field
is applicable for cancer therapy.

Results and Discussion
When a pulsed electric field (F) is applied to
a spherical cell, the voltage increase, that is, ΔVc, across the cell membrane as a function of time, t, is given as follows26 1  Here, f is the internal field
factor, r is the radius of the spherical cell, τc is the charging time constant of the outer cell membrane,
θ is the angle between the cell radius vector and electric field.
Here, the effect of the substructure of the potential distribution
is assumed to be negligible. When the pulse width of the applied electric
field is large enough in comparison with τc, the
voltage across the membrane becomes very large, resulting in a breakdown
of the cell membrane and production of the pore on the cell surface.
When the pulse width of the applied electric field is small enough,
on the other hand, the voltage across the membrane is negligible,
resulting in a deep penetration of the applied electric field into
the intracellular organs. In a single-shell model, τc is roughly estimated to be 150 ns, assuming a spherical cell having
a radius of 10 μm, internal and external resistivity of 100
Ω cm, membrane capacitance of 1 μF cm–2, and the volume fraction of the cell in suspension as much smaller
than 1.25 If the nsPEF, whose pulse width
is less than 50 ns, is applied to cells, therefore, the applied field
is expected to be penetrated into the cell before the charging of
the cell membrane and intracellular function may be affected.

The effects of nsPEF on lifetime and intensity of the autofluorescence
of NADH were examined in cancer and normal cells, that is, Wistar-King-Aptekman
rat fetus fibroblast (WFB) cells and W31 cells, which are the malignant
transformed cells from WFB. The cells were incubated between the microelectrodes
used for application of nsPEF (Figure S1 in Supporting Information (SI)), which were introduced in the inverted
confocal microscope. The results obtained, with a field strength of
45 kV cm–1, a pulse width of 10 ns, a frequency
of 1 kHz, and 180 s application time, are shown in Figure 1. As shown in Figure S2, the fluorescence decay profiles of NADH were fitted
by assuming a multiexponential decay. The fluorescence of NADH was
selectively observed at a detection wavelength of 447–470 nm,
with 380 nm excitation, because we have confirmed that fluorescence
spectra observed with excitation at 380 nm are assigned to the spectra
of NADH both in WFB and W31 cells.13 The
pulsed electric field altered the distribution of the fluorescence
intensity of NADH in each cell; the nucleus could be distinguished
from other fluorescent organelles before application of the electric
field because of its weak fluorescence intensity, whereas the fluorescence
intensity was diffusingly distributed throughout the cell after application
of the electric field. As the pulse width of the applied electric
field became larger, the diffused spread of the fluorescent intensity
became clearer (Figures 2 and 3). The morphology of each cell was also
affected by the pulsed electric field, especially in the cancer cells;
the applied electric field induced fragmentation of cancer cells,
whereas a leaky blebbing was observed in normal cells. The autofluorescence
lifetime of NADH was also affected by the electric fields. In both
normal and cancer cells, the fluorescence lifetime of NADH was increased
by application of nsPEFs (see Figures 1–3).

images (left) and lifetime images (right)
of NADH before and after the application of an electric field for
3 min, with a 10 ns pulse width, a field strength of 45 kV cm–1, and 1 kHz frequency, shown by F(OFF) and F(ON), respectively, in normal cells (WFB)
(a) and in cancer cells (W31) (b). The corresponding histograms of
the fluorescence lifetimes are shown in (c) and (d).

with a 30 ns pulse width, a field strength of 45 kV cm–1, and 1 kHz frequency, shown by F(OFF) and F(ON), respectively, in WFB (a) and in W31 cells (b). The
corresponding histograms of the fluorescence lifetimes obtained from
the lifetime images are shown in (c) and (d).

Figure 3 Autofluorescence intensity images (left) and lifetime images (right)
of NADH before and after application of an electric field for 3 min,
with a 50 ns pulse width, a field strength of 45 kV cm–1, and 1 kHz frequency, shown by F(OFF) and F(ON), respectively, in WFB (a) and in W31 cells (b). The
corresponding histograms of the fluorescence lifetimes obtained from
the lifetime images are shown in (c) and (d).

The total intensity of the NADH fluorescence of each cell
is also
affected by application of the electric fields. When the pulse width
of the applied electric field was as large as 50 ns, for example,
the total fluorescence intensity of each cell was largely enhanced
in both normal and cancer cells (Figures 3 and 4a). As the pulse
width became smaller, the magnitude of the field-induced increase
in intensity became smaller in both normal and cancer cells. When
the pulse width was as short as 10 ns, further, the fluorescence intensity
in the cancer cells became weaker after application of nsPEF (Figure 1). Thus, normal and
cancer cells showed different electric field effects from each other
in the autofluorescence intensity of NADH. For 10, 30, and 50 ns pulse
applications, the autofluorescence lifetime of NADH became longer,
irrespective of the pulse width, when the applied field was as strong
as 45 kV cm–1 (Figures 1–3). Furthermore,
the electric fields that had a shorter pulse width induced larger
changes in the fluorescence lifetimes in both normal and cancer cells,
and the ratio of the fluorescence lifetime after application of the
electric field relative to that before the field application was greater
in cancer cells than in normal cells at all of the pulse widths (Figure 4b). Here, it is noted
that the intensity shown in Figure 4a was obtained by integrating intensities of all of
the cells in each image observed before and after application of nsPEF,
not for each cell. The integrated intensity of NADH fluorescence thus
obtained corresponds to the intensity of one cell in Figure 3a and that of more than 10
cells in Figure 2b.
To check the reproducibility, more than three experiments were done
with different samples under the same experimental conditions. In
relation with Figure 3a, for example, the other two experimental results of WFB before
and after application of nsPEF having 50 ns pulse width and 45 kV
cm–1 are shown in Figure S3. The fluorescence lifetime shown in Figure 4b was obtained from the peak in the histogram
of the fluorescence lifetime. The error bars given in Figure 4, both in intensity and lifetime,
were determined from the difference in the ratios between the results
of the experiments carried out with different samples under the same
experimental conditions.

obtained after
application of electric field (IF≠0) relative to the intensity before the application
(IF=0) in normal (WFB,
solid lines) and cancer cells (W31, broken lines) as a function of
application time, with different pulse widths of 10, 30, and 50 ns,
respectively, and 45 kV cm–1 field strength and
1 kHz frequency. (b) The ratio of the fluorescence lifetime of NADH
after application of the electric field (τF≠0) relative to the lifetime before application (τF=0), as a function of the pulse width of
the applied electric field.

In the origin of the field-induced change in fluorescence
intensity,
two possibilities can be considered: one is the field-induced change
in the concentration of fluorescent NADH and another is the field-induced
change in the fluorescence quantum yield of NADH, resulting from change
in the nonradiative decay rate of the fluorescent NADH. In every case
having a pulse width of 10–50 ns, τ(F≠0)/τ(F=0) > 1.0 (see Figures 1–3 and 4b), that is, the fluorescence lifetime becomes longer
in the presence of the electric field, indicating that nonradiative
decay at the emitting state of NADH autofluorescence becomes slower
with the application of nsPEF. In other words, the fluorescence quantum
yield is considered to increase in the presence of nsPEF. If the concentration
of NADH is independent of the application of nsPEF, the fluorescence
intensity of NADH should be increased by application of nsPEF. The
decrease in the nonradiative decay rate may indicate that the protein
binding of NADH becomes stronger. As shown in Figure 4, fluorescence intensity becomes higher by
a factor of more than 4 both in WFB and in W31, with a pulse width
of 50 ns, whereas the increase in the lifetime is less than twice
in both cases. These results show that the field-induced increase
in the intensity cannot be explained only by increase in the fluorescence
quantum yield. Then, there is no doubt that the field-induced increase
in the fluorescence intensity, with a pulse width of 50 ns, mainly
results from the field-induced increase in the number of fluorophores,
that is, the concentration of the emitting species of NADH is increased
by the application of nsPEF. When the pulse width is as short as 10
ns, field-induced decrease in fluorescence intensity is observed in
W31 (see Figures 1b
and 4a, indicating that the concentration of
NADH in W31 is decreased by application of nsPEF). Thus, the field-induced
change in concentration of NADH depends on the pulse width of the
applied nsPEF although the fluorescence lifetime of NADH becomes longer
by application of the electric field irrespective of the pulse width
of the applied nsPEF.

Figure 5 Autofluorescence intensity images (left) and lifetime
images (right)
of NADH before and after application of an electric field for 3 min,
with a 10 ns pulse width, a field strength of 500 V cm–1, and 1 kHz frequency, shown by F(OFF) and F(ON), respectively, in normal cells (WFB) (a) and in cancer
cells (W31) (b). The corresponding histograms of the fluorescence
lifetimes are shown in (c) and (d).

The observed pulse-width dependence of the electric field
effect
on the intensity and lifetime of NADH fluorescence in these normal
and cancer cells is the same as the one observed in HeLa cells,25 implying that these field effects are common
in live cells. In HeLa cells, it was suggested that the so called
mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex, which may induce
apoptosis, is generated by the application of nsPEF, which has a pulse
width as large as 50 ns. When the pulse width is as short as 10 ns,
on the other hand, mitochondria outer-membrane permeabilization may
be induced by nsPEF, and apoptotic factors such as cytochrome c and an apoptosis-inducing factor may be released into
the cytosol. Thus, two mechanisms may be considered for the field-induced
apoptosis, depending on the pulse width of the applied nsPEF, as suggested
in the case of HeLa cells.

The electric field effect on the
fluorescence lifetime of NADH
may be evidence of the occurrence of apoptosis and/or necrosis. In
a previous study, no major changes were observed in the autofluorescence
of NADH under H2O2-induced necrosis in both
the HeLa and 143B cells.27 On the other
hand, an increase in the NADH autofluorescence lifetime was observed
during staurosporine (STS)-induced and N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine-induced apoptosis
in the HeLa cells.27,28 Then, we examined the relationship
between the autofluorescence lifetime of NADH and apoptosis in both
WFB and W31 cells using a 1 μM concentration of STS. The induction
of STS is known to release cytochrome c from mitochondria
and activate caspase-3,29 which is one
of the caspase groups that are executioners of apoptosis. It was found
that the autofluorescence lifetime of NADH increased after the addition
of 1 μM STS in both normal and cancer cells (Figure S4). Therefore, it is concluded that application of
nsPEF induces apoptosis both in normal (WFB) and cancer (W31) cells,
as in the case of the HeLa cells.24,25 Apoptosis
is traditionally defined by morphological criteria, such as cell shrinkage
and cell surface blebbing. In fact, some morphological changes were
detected after application of nsPEF in our study in both the cell
types, depending on the amplitude and pulse width of the applied electric
field, as shown in Figures S5 and S6. The
detection of apoptosis using the fluorescence lifetime of NADH has
a great advantage of confirming apoptosis with label-free detection,
and this method has been applied in our previous study regarding the
nanosecond pulsed field-induced apoptosis of HeLa cells25 and also in a recent study by another group.30

Electric field-induced apoptosis, which
is revealed by change in
the fluorescence properties of NADH, may occur via the mitochondria-mediated
pathway; the pulsed electric field acts on mitochondria to cause cytochrome c release from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, along
with the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential.31,32 The released cytochrome c, forms an apoptosome,
which activates caspase, resulting in cellular destruction events.33,34 The increase in the fluorescence intensity during cell death, for
example, with a 50 ns pulse width, has been ascribed to the field-induced
increase in the number of fluorescent NADH due to the change in the
redox ratio of NADH/NAD+ and/or the depletion of energy
metabolism in mitochondria. A monotonic decrease in NADH fluorescence
intensity has previously been reported in correlation with mitochondrial
membrane potential dissipation.35 Thus,
the present results of the pulse-width dependence of NADH intensity
may indicate that the increase in the NADH concentration and changes
in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential are involved in the apoptosis
induced by application of nsPEF. Additionally, there may be a possibility
that an electric field with a narrow pulse width penetrates efficiently
through the outer membrane of mitochondria and directly modifies the
electron transfer process of mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate
production because intramolecular and intermolecular electron transfer
can be affected by external electric field.36 The pulse-width dependence of the change in NADH fluorescence intensity
and lifetime and in cellular morphology is an indication of the divergent
subcellular effect of pulsed electric fields on normal and cancer
cells.

The intensity and lifetime images of the autofluorescence
of NADH
in the WFB and W31 cells were also observed before and after application
of a pulsed electric field, which was as low as 500 V cm–1 (applied voltage of 5 V and 100 μm as a distance of electrodes),
with 10 ns pulse width, 1 kHz frequency, and 180 s application time
(Figure 5). The lifetime
of the WFB cells remained unchanged even after application of the
pulsed fields. However, when an electric field with the same amplitude
and pulse width was applied to cancer cells, the cells showed remarkable
changes in morphology and in fluorescence intensity and lifetime.
The change in the intensity and lifetime occurs irrespective of the
location of a cell (Figure 5b), indicating that the cell death mechanism is not related
to the proximity of a cell to the electrodes. Thus, the experimental
results with a narrow pulse width of 10 ns showed that a magnitude
as small as 500 V cm–1 was large enough for the
applied electric field to induce apoptosis in cancer cells, whereas
the healthy cells remained unaffected. To show the reproducibility
of the difference of the field effect between normal and cancer cells,
with a field strength of 500 V cm–1, another result
is shown in Figure S7. These results show
that a pulsed electric field with a short pulse width has a stronger
effect in cancer cells than that in healthy cells. This field-strength
dependence of the applied electric field effect may work as an option
to selectively kill the cancer cells, that is, an electric field with
a low amplitude and short pulse width can be used to kill the cancer
cells, without any serious damage to normal cells. Therefore, the
application of ultrashort pulsed electric fields may become a potential
technique for cancer therapy without injuring the normal cells by
adjusting the applied field conditions.

The field strengths,
45 kV cm–1 and 500 V cm–1, used
in the present study were the maximum and minimum
field strengths, respectively, which we could apply in the present
experimental system, with stability. Further experiments are necessary
to examine the detailed field-strength dependence, which will be the
future problem.

Conclusions
Autofluorescence lifetime
images as well as intensity images of
NADH have been measured in normal and cancer cells, that is, in the
WFB cells and W31 cells, which are the malignant transformed cells
from WFB, before and after the application of nsPEF, having a strength
of 45 kV cm–1, a frequency of 1 kHz, and a pulse
width of 10, 30, or 50 ns. In every case, the fluorescence lifetime
of NADH becomes longer by application of nsPEF. This behavior is very
similar to the change in the fluorescence lifetime of NADH in these
cells observed after the addition of STS, which is a well-known apoptosis
inducer. Morphological change in the cell structure is also induced
by the application of pulsed electric field. These results show that
apoptosis is induced in both normal and cancer cells by application
of nsPEFs having a pulse width in the region of 10–50 ns. The
field effect on the intensity and lifetime of NADH depends on the
pulse width of the applied electric field. The magnitude of the field-induced
increase in the fluorescence lifetime of NADH has a tendency to increase
with decreasing pulse width, probably because the electric fields
with a short pulse width can penetrate deeply into the mitochondria
and initiate apoptosis more efficiently. It is also found that apoptosis
can be induced only in cancer cells using a suitable nsPEF, for example,
with a narrow pulse width of 10 ns and a magnitude as small as 500
V cm–1, showing a possibility that an ultrashort
pulsed electric field is applicable for a drug-free cancer therapy.
The present experimental results of the autofluorescence intensity
and lifetime in healthy and cancer cells may open a new gateway for
a drug-free cancer therapy using ultrashort pulsed electric fields.

Methods
Cell Culture
The WFB cells and W31 cells that were
H-ras oncogene-transfected cells from WFB were incubated in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (D5796; Sigma), supplemented with 2
× 105 U dm–3 penicillin G, 200 mg
of streptomycin sulfate, and 10% fetal bovine serum.13,37 The cells that were originally donated to one of the authors (L.L.)
from Prof. N. Sato at Sapporo Medical University38 were used. The cell culture medium was replaced by calcium-
and magnesium-free phosphate buffered saline (PBS (−)) medium
just before the measurements of the autofluorescence lifetime of NADH.

Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging
FLIM images of the endogenous
fluorophores of NADH in normal cells (WFB) and cancer cells (W31)
were measured using an inverted confocal microscope (C1; Nikon) equipped
with an objective lens (40×, NA 0.95) and a time-correlated single
photon counting system (SPC-830; Becker & Hickl GmbH).25,39 The second harmonic output of 380 nm from a mode-locked Ti:sapphire
laser (Tsunami; Spectra Physics, pulse duration of approximately 100
fs, repetition rate of 81 MHz) was used as an excitation light. Because
of the low power of the excitation laser light, which was roughly
estimated to be 0.03 nJ per pulse, two-photon excitation was negligible
in the present experiments. The autofluorescence signal of NADH in
cells was detected in the region of 447–460 nm by a microchannel-plate
photomultiplier tube (R3809U; Hamamatsu). The observed decay profiles
were fitted by assuming a tri-exponential decay, with a convolution
of the instrumental response function, that is, the decay was assumed
to be given by ∑iAi exp(−t/τi), wherein Ai and τi are the preexponential factor and lifetime of the ith component, respectively, where i = 1, 2, and
3, and ∑iAiτi/Ai was obtained as the average
lifetime in each pixel, the details of which were shown in refs (13) and (25). The acquisition time
of the FLIM image was typically 20 min. The analysis of the FLIM data
was conducted with SPC image software (Becker & Hickl GmbH).

Electrode Microchamber
A gold-coated microchannel electrode
chip for in vivo observation of effects of the pulsed electric field
on a single cell was constructed on a microscopic cover glass by the
UV photolithography method (Figure S1 of
SI). The details of the construction procedure were given in our previous
papers.24,25 Briefly, the microchamber shape was first
constructed by the exposure of an SU-8 2015 negative photoresist (Micro
Chem) to UV light through the mask pattern of the electrode. Then,
the positive photoresist ZEP520 (ZEONREX Electronic Chemicals) was
spun on the prepared microchamber and was exposed to UV light through
the same mask as that used for the negative photoresist. After the
chemical treatment, a layer of gold was deposited on the microchamber
by helicon sputtering (MPS-4000C1/HC1; ULVAC). The substrate was baked
from room temperature to 120 °C to melt ZEP520, resulting in
the release of metal film from undesired areas of the substrate. The
resulting electrode microchamber was immersed in acetone and cleaned
by ultrasonic treatment. The distance between the electrodes was approximately
100 μm, and the final depth of the microchamber was approximately
20 μm. The WFB or W31 cells were cultured at the bottom of the
electrode microchamber. A pulse generator (Avtech Electrosystems)
was used to generate nsPEFs. The pulsed voltages with a width of 10,
30, or 50 ns and a strength of 450 or 5.0 V were applied, with a load
resistance of 50 Ω. The applied field strength was evaluated
from the applied voltage divided by the distance between the electrodes.
Therefore, the application of 450 and 5 V corresponds to a field strength
of 45 kV cm–1 and 500 V cm–1,
respectively.
