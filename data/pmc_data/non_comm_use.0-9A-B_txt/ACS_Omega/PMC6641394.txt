This paper presents
an investigation into the behavior and performance
of blends of Nylon 6 (PA6), polypropylene (PP), and poly(lactic acid)
(PLA), compatibilized with maleic anhydride-grafted PP (PP-g-MA). The mechanical performance of ternary PA6/PP/PLA
blends was superior to that of binary PA6/PP blends because of the
addition of PLA. Through blending with PLA, the tensile and flexural
strength and modulus were enhanced, maintaining performance similar
to that of neat PA6. Tensile performance was further enhanced through
reactive compatibilization of the blends with PP-g-MA due to the improved homogeneity of the materials. Impact behavior
of the blends was found to be highly dependent on morphology, and
the toughening behavior was observed at certain blending ratios. In
PA6/PP blends, fractionated crystallization behavior was investigated
through differential scanning calorimetry, in which both PA6 and PP
droplets were crystallized at supercooled states. This effect was
highly influenced by the presence of the compatibilizing agent and
its effect on the morphology of the dispersed phase. As the droplet
size of the dispersed phase was decreased to submicron levels, the
efficiency of heterogeneous nucleation was limited. Crystallization
of PLA in the blend was poor, but PP-g-MA was found
to have an impact on its rate of crystallization.

1 Introduction
The
durability and mechanical and tribological properties of polyamides,
especially Nylon 6 (PA6) and Nylon 6,6 (PA6,6), are the driving reasons
behind their frequent adoption in applications requiring high strength
and longevity, especially within the automotive industry. Polyamides
are frequently blended with polyolefins or elastomers to improve the
additional aspects, especially their resistance to moisture and their
toughness. Blending of PA6 with polypropylene (PP) is a well-researched
topic because of their complementary properties. Because of the immiscibility
of these polymers, a compatibilization route is necessary to produce
blends with desirable qualities. Compatibilization is frequently accomplished
through reactive extrusion with maleic anhydride-grafted PP (PP-g-MA), which eases the interfacial tension between PP and
PA6 through the formation of a graft copolymer.1−8 Maleated compatibilizing agents are very commonly used in polyolefin
systems for improving miscibility in multipolymer blends, as well
as for promoting adhesion to dispersed filler materials.9 In PA6/PP blends, this reactive compatibilization
scheme yields a PP-g-PA6 graft copolymer via a reaction
in the melt state between terminal diamine groups of the PA6 with
anhydride groups in PP-g-MA.10 Although the incorporation of PP into PA6 can improve its moisture
resistance and reduce the overall cost, this comes at the expense
of reduced strength and stiffness. This study aims to offset the loss
of tensile properties through the incorporation of a biopolymer, poly(lactic
acid) (PLA), to produce ternary polymer blends. PLA is a renewable,
biobased polymer with excellent tensile and flexural strength and
modulus; through ternary blending with PLA, it is hypothesized that
mechanical properties close to those of neat PA6 can be achieved.
The morphology and rheological behavior of these blends will be presented
in a concurrent manuscript.

Crystallization in blends of semicrystalline
polymers is influenced
by the presence of nucleating sites, interaction between the polymer
phases, and blend morphology. In binary and ternary blends such as
the ones investigated in this study, the size of the dispersed droplets
and the interaction between the polymer phases are heavily dependent
on the presence of a compatibilizer. A concurrent study demonstrated,
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy,
that the incorporation of PP-g-MA in PA6/PP and PA6/PP/PLA
blends reduced the droplet size of PP to below one micron in diameter
and promoted the interaction and adhesion at the PA6/PP interface.
Rheological investigation further confirmed that PP-g-MA enhanced the interaction between PA6 and the dispersed phases.
Interesting crystallization behavior has been observed in several
studies of PA6-based blends. When analyzing the crystallization of
PA6/PP blends compatibilized with PP-g-MA, Lee and
Yang observed that the crystallizing temperature (Tc) of the dispersed PP decreased in the presence of the
compatibilizer.7 Holsti-Miettinen et al.
observed a similar depression of the Tc of PP through compatibilization of PA6/PP blends with maleated elastomers
but found no such effect in the presence of PP-g-MA.11 The present work studies how the addition of
PP-g-MA affects the crystallization processes in
both binary and ternary blends, as well as the influence of the droplet
size and polymer–polymer interactions in between PA6, PP, and
PLA. A wide range of blending ratios was employed to provide an in-depth
understanding of how the mechanical properties and crystallization
mechanics evolve as a function of blend morphology and blending ratios.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Crystallization Behavior
2.1.1 Fractionated Crystallization of Dispersed
Phases in Binary Blends
Differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) was used to analyze the melting and crystallization behavior
of the binary blends of PA6 and PP. The full description of the blending
ratios and nomenclature is given in the experimental section. For
reference, Figure S1 (Supporting Information) shows both the cooling (a) and the second heating curves of each
of the neat polymers (b).

For both PA6 and PP, only the melting
transition appears on heating in the range investigated. The beginning
of melting of PA6 is around 190 °C, and the melt phase consists
of two peaks, corresponding to the melting of the γ-crystalline
phase at 215 °C and the α-crystalline phase at 222 °C.12,13 The beginning of PP melting is around 130 °C with a peak maximum
at 164 °C.

The cooling curves at all blending ratios of
PA6/PP are observed
in Figure 1a. The observed
behavior is expected for crystallization of two immiscible polymers,
as the crystallization events are independent and proportional only
to the fraction of each respective polymer. This was further confirmed
by the nearly constant crystallinity at all blending ratios of the
respective PA6 and PP phases as shown in Table 1. The crystallinity (Xc) of the PA6 fraction is around 24–25% in all blending
ratios, whereas the PP fraction is consistently twice the value, around
48–50% crystalline. The lone exception is observed in B-90,
in which the crystallinity of the PP fraction was slightly reduced.
As explained by Arnal et al., as well as Santana and Müller,
PP crystallization is highly dependent on morphology when it is in
the dispersed phase.14,15 PP crystallinity is reduced when
it is finely dispersed because of the limitation of heterogeneous
nucleation as the PP domain size is reduced. This is corroborated
by the fine dispersion of PP droplets observed via SEM in B-90. In
this blend, PP droplets were on average around 5 μm in diameters,
with some droplets observed as small as 1 μm (Figure 2a). It is also reported by
the manufacturer that the grade of PP used in this study contains
a nucleating additive.

This concept applies further to the
crystallization of the PP fraction
in compatibilized binary blends. As observed in Table 1, the crystallinity of the PP fraction is
nearly constant when PP is the dominant phase in the blend. However,
as the PP fraction in these blends decreases below 50% and becomes
the dispersed phase as phase inversion occurs, its crystallinity is
steadily reduced, with a minimum of 20% crystallinity in BC-90. Furthermore,
a fractionated crystallization of PP was observed in the cooling curves
of these materials (Figure 3). The exothermic crystallization is shifted progressively
lower as the PP fraction decreases and is separated into two distinct
exothermic events.

Figure 3 DSC cooling curves showing fractionated crystallization
of the
PP phase. Curves are vertically scaled proportionally to the blend
PP fraction.

A similar fractionated
crystallization in PA6/PP blends compatibilized
by PP-g-MA has been observed in several studies.7,16,17 A double crystallization of the
peak of PP in PA6-compatibilized blend was also observed by Lee and
Yang.7 Ikkala et al. and Tang et al. both
support the explanation that the fractionated crystallization of PP
is caused by the limitation of nucleating heterogeneities in the dispersed
PP droplets as the particle is reduced below a critical volume.16,17 In the context of an immiscible system containing numerous small
dispersed domains, Frensch and Jungnickel adapted eqs 1–3 on the premise that the proportion of those domains which contain
exactly n nucleating heterogeneities follows a Poisson
distribution18 1  in which M is the concentration
of nucleating heterogeneities in the dispersed phase and VD is the average domain volume of the dispersed phase.
It follows that the proportion of these domains which contains at
least one nucleating heterogeneity can be expressed as 2   3  

Thus, we
can expect that as the size of the dispersed PP domains
decreases, the fraction of these domains that can crystallize through
heterogeneous nucleation is reduced. These domains may undergo crystallization
at supercooled temperatures because of nucleation from less efficient
heterogeneities or even homogeneous nucleation of the polymer.14−17 Supercooling is a phenomenon in which a polymer may remain in a
liquid state below its typical crystallization temperature. The crystallization
observed in this study correlates strongly with the greatly reduced
domain size of dispersed PP with the addition of PP-g-MA as observed by SEM in Figure 2b. Upon addition of PP-g-MA, the PP
was very finely dispersed in droplets less than 1 μm in diameter.

Supercooling of the dispersed phase is also observed when PA6 is
dispersed in the PP matrix. From Figure 1, we can clearly observe that in compatibilized
binary blends in which PA6 is the dominant phase, the PA6 crystallizes
at ∼190 °C, just as observed in the uncompatibilized blends.
However, upon phase inversion beginning in BC-50, the PA6 crystallization
exotherm at this temperature completely disappears (Figure 1b). At the first glance, it
would appear that PA6 is remaining in an amorphous state; however,
the subsequent second heating curves revealed PA6 melting enthalpies
between 60 and 90 J/g, depending on the polymer content. While no
cold crystallization was observed on heating, the high melting enthalpies
measured should present a significant crystallization peak. The cooling
curves in Figure 1 show
a single exotherm at ∼123 °C, and no cold crystallization
is observed in the heating curve upstream from the individual melting,
implying that PA6 is crystallizing simultaneously with PP crystallization.
A typical heating and cooling curve of BC-30 demonstrating this effect
is included in the Supporting Information (Figure S2). PA6 crystallization not only occurs but also increases
as the PA6 fraction decreases (Table 1). This is explained by the supercooled crystallization
of small dispersed domains of PA6. As is demonstrated via SEM in the
concurrent study, the size of the PA6 domains in these blends is reduced
below 1 μm because of the improved miscibility facilitated by
PP-g-MA grafting.

a These values have greater uncertainty
because of the relatively small fraction of PLA in these blends.

Further investigation of the
derivative heat flow in this region
confirms that this exotherm is a single-step process (Figure 4) and that the enthalpy of
these events is equal to the sum of the PP and PA6 melting enthalpy
in the subsequent heating curve. Thus, the dispersed PA6 fraction
remains in a supercooled state until fast crystallization is induced
at the droplet interface as the surrounding PP phase crystallizes.
A series of papers by Tol et al. comprehensively investigated the
phenomena of supercooled crystallization of PA6 dispersed in blends
with polystyrene (PS).19−22 They observed similar depression of the crystallization of PA6 when
it was finely dispersed in PS, with maximum supercooling achieved
in compatibilized blends with submicron dispersed domains of PA6.
In this study, they concluded that PA6 crystallization can be induced
at supercooled temperatures either through homonucleation or by the
vitrification of the surrounding PS phase. In this case, the vitrification
of the polymers studied occurs below 60 °C, and hence this factor
was not considered.

BC-40, and (e) BC-50.

Observing the second melting endotherm, there is a clear
difference
in the polymorphism of PA6 crystallized at supercooled temperatures
(PA6 dispersed phase) and the PA6 main phase. Figure 5 reveals that the more stable α-form
dominates the PA6 crystallized at supercooled temperatures (in this
case, BC-30), whereas in BC-70 both the α-form and γ-form
are observed.13 It is also clear that the
onset melting temperature of PA6 was lower when PA6 was finely dispersed.
This trend was consistent through all tested blends, with PA6 exhibiting
both crystalline forms when the phase was continuous but mainly the
γ-form when it was dispersed; similar melting exotherms of finely
dispersed PA6 can also be observed in the work of Ikkala et al.11 This is in contrast to the findings of Tol et
al., who observed that supercooled PA6 droplets in PS crystallized
mainly in the γ-form as the droplet size was decreased.22 This may be explained by the different methods
of PA6 nucleation; Tol et al. observed in this paper that PA6 crystallized
mainly through homogenous nucleation, whereas in the present study,
the crystallization of PP induced PA6 crystallization.

2.1.2 Crystallization in Ternary Blends
For several reasons, analysis of PLA melting and crystallization
within the ternary blends proved to be more difficult than that in
the binary blends. The melting peak of PLA was observed at 168 °C,
which coincided very closely with that of PP (164 °C), making
it challenging to differentiate the two events. In the cooling curves,
differentiation of PLA crystallization events was made additionally
difficult by the relatively low enthalpy of crystallization of PLA
(14 J/g) compared to that of PP (107 J/g) and PA6 (65 J/g). In blends
containing such small fractions of PLA (as low as 5 wt %), accurate
measurements of the enthalpy of PLA transitions were challenging.
Although PA6 and PP showed a fast crystallization, PLA crystallized
slowly, with a broad, shallow crystallization peak at 96 °C during
the cooling run. In fact, the majority of the melting enthalpy observed
in neat PLA was due to cold crystallization during the heating run.
At a cooling rate of 10 °C/min, the PLA crystallized incompletely
because of its relatively slow rate of crystallization, leading to
cold crystallization around 98 °C during the second heating as
seen in Figure S1b.23

The crystallization of PA6 was incredibly consistent
in all ternary blends, as seen in Table 2. Regardless of the proportion of PLA and
PP, the crystallinity of the PA6 phase was around 24–25% in
all ternary blends, just as in neat PA6. Because PA6 is the major,
continuous phase in these systems and it crystallizes at a much higher
temperature than PP and PLA, its crystallization is completely independent
of the dispersed phases in the system. Just as in the binary blends,
although PA6 is the major phase in the ternary blends, its crystallization
was also unaffected by the addition of PP-g-MA as
a compatibilizer. However, this was not the case for the dispersed
phases.

As was observed in the preceding section, the addition
of PP-g-MA depressed the crystallization temperature
of the PP
phase because of the greatly decreased droplet size (Figure 6). In all ternary blends, the
addition of PP-g-MA depressed the PP crystallization
by 15–20 °C and resulted in a double peak. Although it
would seem intuitive to attribute the two peaks to each of PP and
PLA, this behavior was also observed in the binary blends. The crystallization
peaks observed in Figure 6 are caused almost entirely by the crystallization of PP because
of the substantially higher enthalpy of crystallization observed in
neat PP compared to neat PLA. Rather than a second peak due to the
crystallization of PLA, the second peak is attributed to the crystallization
of small PP droplets by less efficient nucleating heterogeneities. Table 2 shows the combined
melting enthalpy of PP and PLA in the ternary blends; whereas the
two melting events could not be differentiated because of their close
overlap, and some conclusions may still be drawn from the combined
value. It has already been shown that the majority of this melting
enthalpy comes from the PP phase. In the uncompatibilized blends,
the melting enthalpy is fairly consistent, decreasing slightly as
the fraction of PP and PLA is reduced. As observed in the binary blends,
fractionated crystallization due to the addition of PP-g-MA decreases the crystallinity of the PP phase, and this effect
increases as the PP volume fraction decreases (see Figure 3). These results correlate
strongly with the vast reduction in the PP droplet size observed by
microscopic methods in the compatibilized ternary blends.

Figure 6 Depression
and fractionation of PP crystallization in compatibilized
ternary blends.

Though the melting and
crystallization of PLA is clouded by the
PP phase in this system, the faster PP crystallization during cooling
allowed the observation of the cold crystallization of PLA separately;
this can be observed clearly in the second heating curve of T-80 in Figure 1a. In the uncompatibilized
ternary blends and neat PLA, cold crystallization of PLA was observed
during both the first and second heating runs. The crystallization
of PLA in these blends was not completed during injection molding
nor was it completed on cooling at 10 K/min, resulting in a cold crystallization
peak during the subsequent heating cycles, which was probably inherent
to the nuclei formed at a lower temperature favoring the crystallization.
As explained previously, most of the PLA crystals, determined by their
melting enthalpy, were formed during their cold crystallization. Thus,
we can expect that the PLA phase in the molded testing samples is
poorly crystalline because of the rapid cooling experienced during
molding. An interesting effect on PLA crystallization transition was
observed after the addition of PP-g-MA to the ternary
blends. Like the uncompatibilized blends, the compatibilized blends
demonstrated cold crystallization of PLA during the first heating
cycle, showing the presence of an incompletely crystallized PLA phase
after molding. However, cold crystallization during the second heating
was reduced by up to 85% compared to the first heating, as shown in Table 2. It is probable that
the presence of the PP-g-MA compatibilizer increased
the crystallization rate of PLA, causing the majority of PLA crystallization
to complete during the cooling run. This effect was also observed
by Akrami et al., using the same grade of PLA in blends with thermoplastic
starch, compatibilized with a maleic anhydride-based additive.24 They found that the addition of the compatibilizer
reduced both the temperature and enthalpy of cold crystallization
of PLA in the blends; an increased rate of PLA crystallization facilitated
more crystal growth during the cooling run.

To further investigate
this behavior, blends of TC-80 were prepared
by varying the levels of PP-g-MA, that is, 0, 2.5,
5, and 7.5 wt %. Although the same effect was observed on cold crystallization
in each blend regardless of the PP-g-MA concentration
(see Figure 7a), the
effect of compatibilizer concentration on the crystallization of PP
from the melt was observed, as shown in Figure 7b. With increasing concentration of PP-g-MA, the crystallization temperature of PP is reduced further.
Although the depression of PP crystallization has been explained previously
as an effect of the droplet size, the significant amount of grafting
used here likely decreased the mobility of PP, which hindered the
molecular chain movement required to allow its crystallization. Such
a behavior would also induce a shift of the crystallization to a lower
temperature.

2.2 Mechanical
Properties
2.2.1 Tensile and Flexural Behavior
The
full mechanical properties of the blends investigated in this study
are provided in a table in the supporting figures (Table S1). Starting with the uncompatibilized binary blends,
it is evident that with increasing addition of PP to PA6, there is
a consistent decrease in the tensile and flexural strength and modulus
of the material. These decreased properties follow the same trend
as the reductions observed in multiple studies of PA6/PP binary blends
by Agrawal et al.,3 Huber et al.,1 and Pal and Kale.25 In general, this behavior is typical and expected for an immiscible
polymer blend such as the one studied. The PA6 used in this work has
a relatively high tensile strength and modulus of 75.2 MPa and 2.67
GPa, respectively, compared to the tensile strength and modulus of
the PP (38.9 MPa and 1.89 GPa). As the PP fraction of the blend is
increased, we naturally expect the strength and stiffness of the blend
to be reduced in comparison to neat PA6. As proven by the SEM analysis
in the concurrent study, the binary blend transitions to a cocontinuous
morphology at a blending ratio of 60 PA6/40 PP. This morphology change
can be correlated with the yield elongation behavior observed for
these blends. The yield elongation of the blends decreases from neat
PA6 to B-90 and so on until cocontinuous morphology is reached in
B-60, at which point the minimum yield elongation of the binary blends
is observed. A yield elongation value similar to that of B-60 is observed
in B-70 and B-50, before a steady increase from B-40 to B-10 as the
PP loading increases toward 100%. This change in the yielding behavior
is explained by the shift from a continuous PA6 phase with dispersed
PP domains, to a cocontinuous system, and finally to a continuous
PP phase with dispersed PA6 domains. This morphology evolution is
in very close agreement with that observed by Willis et al. in binary
PA6/PP blends prepared at the same blending ratios.26 Their study similarly demonstrated that phase inversion
occurred at a 60 PA6/40 PP blending ratio.

A major change in
the yielding behavior as well as the tensile and flexural strength
of the blends was observed when 5% PP-g-MA compatibilizer
was added to the binary systems. In the compatibilized blends, the
yield elongation remains nearly the same as that of neat PA6 from
BC-90 to BC-50, after which the yield elongation increases toward
that of neat PP as the PP fraction approaches 100%. The break elongation
is also improved dramatically in all compatibilized binary blends
compared to their uncompatibilized counterparts, with especially high
ductility observed in the PP-dominated blends (BC-30, BC-20, and BC-10).
The increased ductility of the compatibilized binary blend is a result
of the improved adhesion and continuity between the PA6 and PP phases.4,11,25 The tensile and flexural behavior
was also increased with the addition of PP-g-MA to
the binary blends. In BC-90 through BC-50, the tensile and flexural
strength were dramatically improved compared to those of B-90 through
B-50. Figure 8 shows
the flexural strength of both the compatibilized and uncompatibilized
binary blends compared to the upper bound of the ideal strength of
the blends, as determined by the rule of the mixture. We can see that
the uncompatibilized blends substantially underperform compared to
the ideal values; however, the flexural strength of compatibilized
blends is very close to the the ideal values, whereas PA6 is the continuous
phase. The improved strength in the compatibilized blends is a result
of the reduced size of the dispersed phase and superior interaction
at the interface due to the graft copolymer. Improved stress transfer
from the continuous PA6 phase to the dispersed PP allows the blend
to behave more like a homogenous material, resulting in strength closer
to that of an ideal blend. There is a drop-off in strength in the
compatibilized blends when the volume fraction of PA6 drops below
50% and PP becomes the continuous phase. Even when compatibilized,
PA6 did not reinforce PP efficiently as the dispersed phase.

Figure 8 Flexural strengths
of binary blends based on experimental data
and ideal values determined by the rule of mixture.

The addition of PLA in the ternary blends resulted
in an increase
in the tensile strength and modulus of the blends. Starting with the
blends T-90 through T-60, there is a vast increase in the tensile
strength and stiffness compared to that of the equivalent binary blends
(B-90 through B-60). The neat PLA has a tensile strength similar to
that of neat PA6, and a superior Young’s modulus, flexural
strength, and flexural modulus. The high strength and stiffness of
the added PLA counteracts the low strength and stiffness of the PP,
such that the uncompatibilized ternary blends outperform their equivalent
compatibilized binary blends in these aspects. Relative to the equivalent
binary blends, the ductility of the uncompatibilized ternary blends
is improved. As discussed in the morphology section, the PA6, PP,
and PLA phases are mutually immiscible. This leads the dispersed domains
of PLA and PP to remain smaller than those in the binary blends, rather
than coalescing into larger droplets. The smaller size of the dispersed
domains in the uncompatibilized ternary blends results in a higher
elongation at yield and break than in the equivalent binary blends,
and closer to that of neat PA6.

As in the binary blends, the
addition of PP-g-MA
compatibilized the ternary blends and resulted in improved tensile
and flexural strength compared to the uncompatibilized blends, as
well as improved elongation at break. Because of the addition of the
PLA phase, the stiffness of the compatibilized ternary blends meets
or exceeds that of neat PA6, even in BC-60. The flexural strengths
of the compatibilized ternary blends are compared to those of the
compatibilized binary blends in Figure 9. The addition of PLA improves the flexural and tensile
strength and modulus of the polymer blend, resulting in ternary blends
with superior properties to the homologous binary blends. The strength
of the uncompatibilized ternary is improved compared to the binary
blends but drops rapidly once the PA6 fraction drops below 80% because
of the increased size of the dispersed phase, which easily debond
from the PA6 when the material is deformed. As is observed in the
morphology investigation of the concurrent study, the PLA and PP domains
in the compatibilized ternary blends are better distributed and have
improved interaction with the continuous PA6 phase. This leads to
improved stress transfer and limits debonding between the PA6 and
the dispersed phases, thus improving the strength and ductility of
the material. Furthermore, the strength and stiffness of each of the
compatibilized ternary blends far exceeds that of the equivalent binary
blends.

to those of homologous binary blends.

2.2.2 Impact Behavior
Blending with PP
and PLA affected the fracture morphology of PA6, as demonstrated in Figure 10. SEM analysis
at a larger scale (500×) magnification revealed the fracture
morphology of neat PA6 (Figure 10e). Because of the pullout and facile debonding of
the dispersed phases in the uncompatibilized ternary blends (Figure 10a,c), the fracture
morphology is very different from that of neat PA6. However, compatibilization
of the binary and ternary blends leads to a fracture surface that
was nearly indistinguishable from that of neat PA6 (Figure 10b,d). The impact behavior
of the binary blends is complex, whereas at high PP fractions the
impact strength trends toward that of neat PP and in blends with low
PP fractions (B-90 through B-70), the impact strength exceeds that
of neat PA6. A similar trend in the Izod impact strength of binary
PA6/PP blends was observed by González-Montiel et al.5 This increase in impact strength occurs only
in the blends that exhibited the sea-island morphology with a continuous
phase of PA6 and well-dispersed PP domains, which suggests that PP
dispersion is the driving factor behind the toughening effect.11 PA6 is well-known as a notch-sensitive polymer,
having very low crack propagation energy.27 It is possible that the softer dispersed PP domains within the PA6
hindered crack propagation through the blend via deflection of the
crack tip.

surfaces:

The toughening effect observed
in these binary blends was increased
further with the addition of the PP-g-MA compatibilizer.
The impact strength was maximized in BC-80, which demonstrated a 62%
increase in strength compared to neat PA6. Improved adhesion between
the PP and PA6 phases further enhanced the toughening effect that
was already present in B-90, B-80, and B-70. The addition of PLA decreased
the impact strength of the ternary blends because of the relatively
brittle nature of PLA, though at high PA6 weight fractions the impact
strength remained close to that of neat PA6. With the addition of
the compatibilizer, the impact strength was increased very slightly,
except in BC-90, which became more brittle. In this blend, the PP
content was replaced entirely by PP-g-MA, negating
the toughening effect observed as a result of the dispersed droplets
of pure PP within the PA6. Up to 30% of the PA6 fraction can be replaced
with PLA and PP before the impact strength deviates significantly
from that of neat Nylon.

3 Conclusions
This study investigates the crystallization and mechanical performance
of PA6/PP/PLA blends, with further investigation of morphology and
rheological behavior established in a concurrent manuscript. In this
section, blend morphology and compatibilization were demonstrated
to have a significant impact on blend crystallization. In particular,
the fine dispersion achieved through compatibilization caused fractionated
crystallization of dispersed PP droplets and confined the crystallization
of PA6 at supercooled temperatures, which was nucleated at the droplet
interface by PP crystallization. The incorporation of PLA as a ternary
blend component had the intended effect of enhancing the tensile strength,
flexural strength, and stiffness of the blends. Through compatibilization
of the blends with PP-g-MA, the mechanical properties
were improved further because of the improved dispersion of the minor
phases, adhesion at the polymer interfaces, and better stress transfer
from the dispersed droplets to the continuous PA6 phase. Overall,
mechanical properties very close to that of neat PA6 were achieved
in compatibilized blends in which up to 30% of PA6 by weight was replaced
by PP and PLA. This study presents an innovative method for improving
classical polyamide–polyolefin blends through blending with
a biopolymer. The work presented here opens further opportunities
for research into reinforced ternary blend systems, increased bio-based
content in polyamide blends, process optimization of reactive extrusion
for ternary blends, and finally investigations into alternate compatibilization
schemes for this polymer system.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
The Nylon 6 used in this
work was Ultramid B27E, a low-viscosity extrusion grade polymer supplied
by BASF (Germany), referred to as PA6. Ingeo Biopolymer 3251D, an
injection-grade PLA from NatureWorks (USA), was used as the PLA phase.
PP 1120H supplied by Pinnacle Polymers (USA) was used as the PP phase.
Fusabond P353 from DuPont (USA) was selected as the maleated PP compatibilizing
agent. The maleation grade of this compatibilizer has been determined
to be in the range of 1.4–1.9%.1,28 The materials
are further detailed in the Supporting Information (Table S2).

4.2 Blend Preparation
All materials were
dried overnight at 80 °C to eliminate the moisture content prior
to processing. Blends were prepared via melt blending in a Leistritz
Micro-27 (Germany) twin-screw extruder in corotation configuration.
The extruder was operated at 100 rpm, with all blend components premixed
and fed from a single feeder at a feed rate of 7 kg/h. The configuration
of the 12 heating zones set at ∼250 °C is shown in Table S3 in the Supporting Information. This heating profile was selected to promote reactive
extrusion at high temperature in the screw-mixing zones, whereas limiting
the time spent at high temperature to reduce the degradation of the
PLA phase. The reduced temperature at the die also limited the expansion
of the extrudate and improved the processability of the material.
Residence time was approximated at 90 s from timing the throughput
of the machine with a stopwatch.

All blends designed in this
study are detailed in Table 3 with the following naming convention: a prefix of B for “binary”,
T for “ternary”, with C for “compatibilized”,
with the number after the dash corresponding to the weight fraction
of PA6 in the blend. For example, BC-80 is a compatibilized blend
of PA6 and PP, with a PA6/PP ratio of 80/20. Blends were selected
to investigate the properties of compatibilized and uncompatibilized
PA6/PLA/PP ternary blends in parallel with equivalent PA6-PP blends.
In the first section, a full blending profile of binary blends of
PA6/PP was developed to analyze the morphology development and mechanical
properties, as well as the role of the compatibilizer in the binary
blend. In the second section, ternary blends of PA6/PLA/PP were produced
following parallel blending ratios to the binary blends. In all compatibilized
blends, 5% PP-g-MA by weight was added, sacrificing
an equivalent amount of the PP fraction. Because of the reduced melt
strength of the uncompatibilized ternary blends, the ternary blends
were only investigated to a blending ratio of 60:20:20 PA6/PLA/PP.
Homologous blends were formulated to contain equivalent weight fractions
of PA6. Each of the neat polymers was also extruded and injection-molded
in the same fashion to give baseline data for comparison.

4.3 Differential Scanning Calorimetry
Melting and crystallization behavior of the blends was studied
using
a TA Instruments (USA) DSC Q200 differential scanning calorimeter.
Temperature and enthalpy calibration were done using an an indium
standard. All tests were run on samples from injection-molded bars
to see the crystalline state of the material in the as-molded condition.
The samples were prepared in 40 μL aluminum pans of about 6–8
mg. The experiments were run under a N2 atmosphere (60
mL min–1). A heat/cool/heat method was used with
the following profile: heating ramp of +10 °C/min from room temperature
to 250 °C (+20 °C above the melting temperature of the most
thermally resistant polymer-PA6) to remove thermal history; cooling
ramp of −10 °C/min to −70 °C; and heating
ramp of 10 °C/min to 250 °C. For crystallinity calculations,
the melting enthalpy for 100% crystalline samples (Hf) was 190 J/g for PP29 and
for 230 J/g for PA6.30 Crystallinity (Xc) calculations were normalized to the weight
fractions (wi) of the individual polymers
as seen in eq 4 4  

4.4 Mechanical Properties
Tensile and
flexural properties were measured using an Instron (USA) 3382 Universal
Testing Machine. Tensile tests were conducted with a 50 mm/min crosshead
speed following the ASTM D638-14 method for type IV specimens. Flexural
tests were conducted with a 14 mm/min crosshead speed following the
ASTM D790-15 method. For each blend, five specimens were tested to
determine the tensile and flexural properties. Ideal blend properties
were determined volumetrically based on the upper bound according
to the rule of mixture.

Izod impact testing was conducted using
a TMI (USA) Monitor impact tester. Samples were notched and prepared
following the ASTM D256-10 method for Izod impact resistance. At least
five samples were prepared and tested for each blend.

4.5 Microscopic Analysis of Fracture Surfaces
The morphology
of impact fracture surfaces was investigated by
SEM. The SEM used for this application was Phenom ProX (Netherlands)
set to an accelerating voltage of 10 kV.
