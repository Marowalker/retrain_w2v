Poly(ethylene
imine) (PEI) has abundant amino groups in a macromolecular
chain and can be used as a graft source for metal nanocomposites,
which shows excellent ability to form stable complexes with heavy
metal ions. In this work, a simple and convenient method was used
to make PEI into a stable hydrogel with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide-N-hydroxysuccinimide and subsequently coprecipitate with
silver nitrate solution or palladium chloride solution to form metal-loaded
composite hydrogels. In addition, the characterizations of composite
hydrogels were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, specific
surface area tests (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller), X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, and ultraviolet spectroscopy. The properties of composite
hydrogels on the catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol were studied.
The results showed that the composite hydrogels could be easily separated
from the water environment, which indicated the large-scale potential
application in organic catalytic degradation and wastewater treatment.

1 Introduction
As an important source
of human survival, water is not only vital
to life but also plays a pivotal role in industrial and agricultural
production.1,2 However, rapid population growth and industrial
activity have led to a crisis of water availability. In addition,
wastewater from untreated industrial and agricultural activities is
uncontrolled, leading to serious environmental problems. Dyes and
heavy metals are harmful substances, and 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) causes
cancer in animals and leads to redox-related toxicity in various tissues.3,4 4-NP is a vital material for chemical processes to produce dyes,
drugs, explosives, and pesticides. Wastewater discharged by chemical
companies usually contains 4-NP. Therefore, the removal of 4-NP from
aqueous solutions has become more and more important. Due to the slower
effects of traditional methods, it is urgent to develop new catalysts.
Many studies have shown the catalytic degradation of 4-NP. For example,
Garole et al. did a lot of research on biosynthesized palladium nanocatalyst
(Pd-NanoCata) using a plant extract from a medicinally important plant,
and the separated palladium nanocatalyst is used for catalytic research
and has good application for the reduction of 4-NP.5 Rasaki et al. successfully prepared Ag/ZnO nanorods by
a facile and cost-saving liquid precipitation-citrate reduction process,
which shows a synergetic catalytic performance for the 4-NP reduction
reaction.6 Compared with Ag nanoparticles,
the catalytic performance and stability are improved.

Hydrogels
are a three-dimensional polymer network with high water
content, chemically or physically cross-linked.7−11 Because of their good biocompatibility and stimulus
response, hydrogels have many applications of wound healing, artificial
organization, drug delivery, and antifouling.12−14 However, the
disadvantages of traditional chemically cross-linked hydrogels are
poor toughness, limited expandability, low mechanical strength, and
limited recyclability, which limit the application of hydrogels.7 In this context, poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) molecules
with three different types of amines are very attractive and have
perfect water solubility.15−22 In addition, there are more important reports on PEI ionic liquid
colloidal microgels. For example, Demirci et al. prepared PEI ionic
liquid colloidal microgels and then used anion-exchanged PEI-based
ionic liquid colloids (ILCs) for in situ preparation of metal nanoparticles
templates of particles (such as Co, Ni, and Cu) to generate ILC composites
(PEI-M) (M: Co, Ni, and Cu). Finally, PEI-M composites were used for
the hydrolysis of NaBH4 to generate H2.23 Simple polymer networks such as PEI, polyamide,
and their derivatives as catalysts could remove inorganic/organic
components in water or wastewater. Thus, some researchers continue
to explore the PEI hydrogel compound with carbon materials and metal
nanoparticles for catalytic and adsorption experiments. Tang et al.
found products extracted from plant cellulose, such as CNF, can be
easily converted into aerogels with controlled density. A cross-linked
three-dimensional network with high porosity is very effective for
the adsorption of methyl orange and copper ions.24 In addition, Guo et al. successfully prepared GO/PEI hydrogels
and used for dye adsorption.1 On this basis,
the prepared RGO/PEI/Ag hydrogels showed good photocatalytic performance
for both RhB and MB.25 Sahiner et al. prepared
PEI-based hydrogels with different morphologies as bulk gel, microgel,
and cryogel forms and used as templates for in situ Co, Ni, and Cu
metal nanoparticle preparation. These composites were used as catalysts
for hydrolysis of NaBH4 for production in the reduction
reaction of 4- and 2- nitrophenols (4-NP and 2-NP, respectively) as
well as the decolorization reaction of methylene blue (MB) and Eosin
Y (EY) dyes.26

In this work, we used
a simple and convenient method to synthesize
the PEI hydrogels, while the initiator agent EDC-HCl can make the
hydrogels more stable. Coprecipitation of palladium chloride solution
and silver nitrate solution formed PEI-Pd or PEI-Ag composite hydrogels.
We explored the effects of different times on the final products and
of the finally formed complexes on the catalytic reduction of 4-NP.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of PEI
Hydrogel and Nanocomposites
Figure 1 shows the
mechanism of hydrogel formation. Abundant amine groups easily form
hydrogel bonding with hydroxyl and carbonyl of N-hydroxysuccinimide
(NHS). Due to a lot of acyl groups, in the presence of an initiator,
they are easy to dehydrate and condense with an amine group to form
a stable valence bond, thereby promoting the formation of a PEI hydrogel.
After the hydrogels are formed, the excess initiator is filtered off
by a hydrogel dialysis process for 7 days. 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
hydrochloride (EDC-HCl) acts as an initiator and promotes changes
in the molecular interactions. As the main substance in the hydrogels,
PEI provides high adhesion and adsorption between Ag/Pd nanocomposites
and substrate hydrogel. In addition, PEI acts as a polymeric cation
in water to neutralize and adsorb all anionic species and chelate
heavy metal ions.

The photos of PEI-Ag or PEI-Pd
composite hydrogels are shown in Figure 2. Different reaction
times of the PEI hydrogel, AgNO3, or PdCl2 produced
different Ag or Pd nanoparticles, which were complexed with the PEI
hydrogel. It is not difficult to find that there are more and more
nanocomposites of Ag and Pd that are attached to the surface of the
hydrogel as the time increases. Especially, the product with 0.5 h
(PEI-Ag0.5) reaction time has a small amount of Ag nanoparticles,
but after 2 h (PEI-Ag2), significant changes have taken place. After
24 h (PEI-Ag24), large areas of Ag nanoparticles were discovered and
tested, and the final catalytic effect was obvious. Similarly, Pd
nanoparticles are reduced and attached to the surface of the PEI hydrogel.
From Figure 2e–h,
a large number of metallic nanocomposites were attached to the surface
of PEI-Pd6 (reaction product for 6 h) and PEI-Pd24 (reaction product
for 24 h). Different levels of metal substances directly affect the
final catalytic effect. In addition, in the absence of composite metal
silver and palladium nanoparticles, the morphologies of the blank
PEI hydrogel are shown in Figure 3a,b. It was clear from the morphologies that the formed
PEI hydrogel had a lot of wrinkles on the surface before dialysis.
After the dialysis process, there were some mesoporous structures.
Because dialysis removed some PEI molecules and excess EDC-HCL, some
mesoporous structures appeared on the surface of the hydrogel. The
results are consistent with the BET test results (Table 1). Due to the load of the metal
nanoparticles, the pore volume and pore diameter become smaller.

Figure 4 shows that
the TEM of different morphologies of different products corresponds
to Figure 2. Figure 4a–d respectively
represents PEI-Ag0.5, PEI-Ag2, PEI-Ag6 (reaction product for 6 h),
and PEI-Ag24. It can be clearly observed that as the reaction time
increases, more and more metal particles are loaded. Figure 4e–h represents PEI-Pd0.5
(reaction product for 0.5 h), PEI-Pd2 (reaction product for 2 h),
PEI-Pd6, and PEI-Pd24, respectively. Therefore, as the reaction time
becomes longer, the particles and agglomerates become larger.

The elemental analysis of C, O, and Ag is shown in Figure 5a–d. Figure 5a shows a SEM image of PEI-Ag24.
Ag nanoparticles can be observed and detected in large numbers (Figure 5d), which indicate
that AgNO3 was reduced and successfully loaded onto the
surface of the PEI hydrogel. Figure 5e shows the SEM image of PEI-Pd24, and elemental mappings
of C, O, and Pd are tested. These results demonstrated that the metal
nanoparticles and hydrogels are well compounded.

and (e) PEI-Pd24 composites, and elemental

The thermogravimetric (TG) curves are demonstrated in Figure 6. The black line
represents PEI hydrogel mass loss with a change of temperature from
40 to 600 °C. Due to the pyrolysis of functional groups in organic
components, the mass changed significantly at 138, 289, and 551 °C.
In Figure 6a, PEI-Ag0.5
composites show a higher thermal stability from 40 to 356 °C,
and PEI-Ag24 is higher than PEI-Ag0.5, which could be attributed to
the structural changes of intermolecular forces, but mass no longer
changes when the temperature reaches 437 °C. From the final remaining
mass, PEI-Ag24 is higher than PEI-Ag0.5, which is due to the long
reaction time caused by sediment. In Figure 6b, the loss of PEI-Pd is faster than that
of PEI-Ag, and the relative stability of PEI-Ag24 is better. The addition
of the composite metal weakens the intermolecular forces between the
original PEI hydrogels. When the temperature reaches 319 °C,
the functional groups and components accelerate thermal decomposition.27,28 The metal contents of prepared PEI-Ag24 and PEI-Pd24 hydrogel composites
were estimated as 132 and 94 mg/g, respectively. In addition, PEI-Ag0.5
and PEI-Pd0.5 were estimated as 23 and 30 mg/g, respectively. In this
work, the nanoparticles formed in the composite hydrogel improved
the thermal stability of the material to a certain extent.

(a) PEI-Ag0.5/24 and (b) PEI-Pd0.5/24 composites.

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a commonly method
used for analyzing the composition and valence of compounds. To further
explore the composite of the PEI hydrogel and nanocomposites of Ag
or Pd, PEI-Ag24 and PEI-Pd24 are selected for research. Figure 7a,c shows the complete measured
spectra of PEI-Ag24 and PEI-Pd24 composites, respectively. The elements
of C, N, O, Ag, and Pd are shown in the entire spectral range of the
observable composite, which further demonstrates that the Ag or Pd
coexist in the composite. In Figure 7b, there are two peaks at 367.8 eV (Ag 3d5/2) and 373.9 eV (3d3/2) corresponding to Ag0,25−27 and Figure 7c shows
the characteristic peaks of Pd 3d, C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s in the curve
of the PEI-Pd24 composite. The binding energies of Pd 3d with the
detailed spectrum in Figure 7d, as shown in the peaks at 336.0 and 341.2 eV, correspond
to metallic palladium Pd (0) (339.8 eV) and Pd (0) (341.6 eV), respectively.28,29 Therefore, the XPS results indicate the presence of metallic Pd
nanoparticles in the product.

composites;
(b, d) high-resolution scan of PEI-Ag24 and PEI-Pd24 composites.

The pore size distribution and specific surface
area of PEI-Ag0.5/24
and PEI-Pd0.5/24 were analyzed using BET. As shown in Figure 8a,c are the nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms of PEI-Ag0.5/24 and PEI-Pd0.5/24, and it can be ascribed
as type II hysteresis loops at the P/P0 = 0.4–0.9, proving that there exist mesoporous
structures in the PEI hydrogels.30,31 Due to the
long-term reaction of PEI-Ag24 and PEI-Pd24, there is more sediment
in these composites, so the adsorption capacity is greatly reduced
compared with PEI-Ag0.5 and PEI-Pd0.5. Figure 8b,d shows the change of pore size distribution
of PEI-Ag or PEI-Pd hydrogels. The PEI-Ag0.5 and PEI-Ag24 are located
in the mesoporous region with average pore diameters of 6.08 and 7.73
nm (Table 1) and pore
volumes of 0.059 and 0.026 cm3/g, respectively. This is
because of the effect of the sediments on the pore volume. The same
as PEI-Pd0.5 and PEI-Pd24, the average pore diameters are 7.09 and
7.26 nm and the pore volume are 0.040 and 0.02 cm3/g, respectively.
These results proved that the larger the pore volume, the greater
the impact on metal composites.

2.2 Catalytic Performances
of PEI-Ag24 and PEI-Pd24
Nanocomposites
Catalytic tests were performed on pure PEI
hydrogels and different products of PEI that react with AgNO3 or PdCl2 at different times. Pure PEI hydrogels have
no catalytic reduction, and the color of 4-NP does not change. This
conformed that 4-NP and 4-AP could seldom be adsorbed into the hydrogel. Figure 9 shows the catalytic
reduction of 4-NP solution by PEI-Ag0.2, PEI-Ag24, PEI-Pd0.5, and
PEI-Pd24. 4-NP (0.005 mol/L) and NaBH4 (0.01 mol/L) solutions
were prepared for catalytic experiments. The peak of 4-NP is at 315.8
nm, NaBH4 is added into the 4-NP solution, and the peak
is translation to 401 nm. Different hydrogels (0.02 g) of PEI-Ag0.5
and PEI-Ag24 were added into the reaction solution, as shown in Figure 9a,b; after 36 min,
10 mL of 4-NP and NaBH4 solution was degraded completely
by PEI-Ag0.5, and a new peak appeared at 303 nm (Figure 9a), which represents the formation
of 4-AP. The PEI-Ag24 needs 10 min to achieve complete catalysis (Figure 9b). According to
the processing of the data at the maximum absorption wavelength, a
linear fit was performed to obtain the relationship between the catalytic
time t and ln(Ct/C0) in Figure 9c. Following the rate equation as ln(Ct/C0) = ln(At/A0) = −Kt, the experimental data of 4-NP reduction were evaluated.5,32−35 Also from the linear fitting (Figure 9c), it was calculated that the linear fitting constants
of PEI-Ag0.5 and PEI-Ag24 are 0.11 and 0.39 min–1. Figure 9d,e shows
the results of catalytic tests by PEI-Pd0.5 and PEI-Pd24, respectively.
PEI-Pd0.5 takes 38 min, but PEI-Pd24 needs 16 min, so the catalytic
effect of PEI-Pd24 is more obvious. The linear fitting constants of
PEI-Pd0.5 and PEI-Pd24 are 0.08 and 0.24 min–1.
According the Arrhenius equation (ln(K) = ln(A) – (Ea/RT)), activation energy
(Ea) values could be used to evaluate the catalytic properties.23,26,36,37 The calculated activation energy (Ea) values of the obtained composite
hydrogels are 25.29, 23.12, 36.10, and 35.31 kJ/mol for PEI-Ag0.5,
PEI-Ag24, PEI-Pd0.5, and PEI-Pd24, respectively. The larger the linear
fit constant, the better the catalytic effect. The fitting curves
also proved that the fitting constant of PEI-Pd24 was larger than
that of PEI-Pd0.5, as shown in Figure 9c,f.

(b) PEI-Ag24, (d) PEI-Pd0.5, and (e) PEI-Pd24 composites. (c, f) Plot
of ln(Ct/C0) versus time for 4-NP.

The stability of the
catalyst is also one of the factors for measuring
quality of the catalyst. Figure 10 shows the results of PEI-Ag24 and PEI-Pd24 for repeated
experiments. Hydrogel pieces (0.02 g) were put into the 4-NP solution.
The catalytic efficiency of PEI-Ag24 reduced to 92% and that of PEI-Pd24
reduced to 94% after eight repeated catalytic processes. After the
catalytic experiment, the hydrogel sheet could be completely removed
and easily cleaned, which proved the good mechanical properties and
stable mechanical properties of the hydrogel. Compared to other nanoparticle
catalysts reported, the results show that the PEI-Ag or PEI-Pd hydrogels
can be well recovered from the solution. The Ag or Pd nanoparticle
composite with the hydrogel is easy to recycle and separate. This
has made a huge contribution to improving cycle utilization.38−45

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully
synthesized PEI-Ag and PEI-Pd
composite hydrogels by a simple and convenient method for catalyzing
4-NP to form 4-AP in sewage. In addition, TEM, TG, BET, XPS, and other
characterization methods were used to verify the deposition of metallic
Ag and Pd nanoparticles in obtained hydrogels. The gelation process
and optimal prepared conditions of the obtained polymer hydrogels
were characterized, and different reaction times on the formation
of complexes at 0.5, 2, 6, and 24 h were studied on the effects of
corresponding reactants for catalytic reaction of 4-NP. The results
show that the PEI-Ag24 and PEI-Pd24 composites have a large amount
of metal Ag or Pd deposition with the best catalytic effect. Therefore,
the large surface area and pore structure in the hydrogel not only
provide the function of the template substrate but also improve the
reuse stability of the composite hydrogel. The results show that the
obtained product hydrogels used after eight repeated cycles have still
showed high performance for catalytic reduction of 4-NP, demonstrating
potential applications in wastewater treatment and composite materials.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
The
starting materials,
poly(ethylene imine) (PEI, Mw = 600 g·mol–1), palladium chloride (PbCl2, 59–60%), and silver
nitrate (AgNO3, 99.8%) were purchased from Aladdin Reagent,
Shanghai, China.1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride
(EDC-HCl) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and p-nitrophenol (4-NP) were purchased from Shanghai Hushi
Reagent. The deionized water (DI water) was made by a two-stage Millipore
Milli-Q water purification system. All reagents were not further purified.

4.2 Preparation Procedure of PEI Hydrogels
PEI was dissolved into DI water at room temperature and ultrasonic
treatment in a water bath. Then, 0.15 g of NHS and 0.5 g of EDC-HCl
were added into the prepared PEI solution, and a moderate amount of
DI water was mixed into the precursor fluid. After 15 min ultrasonic
treatment, samples were treated by standing. Different concentrations
of PEI hydrogels were formed for different times, the higher the concentration,
the faster the molding.

There were four concentrations applied
into PEI hydrogels, they are shown in Table 2. The prepared samples were designated as
PEI#1, PEI#2, PEI#3, and PEI #4. The high concentrations are more
suitable for further study, so the PEI#4 hydrogel was selected to
reduce the metal ion.

PEI#2	200	gel	
PEI#3	250	gel	
PEI#4	300	gel	
4.3 Reduce
Metal Ion
PEI has moderate
and weak reducibility, so PEI#4 was used in the experiment of the
reducing metal ion. In this part, 0.355 g of PdCl2 and
0.339 g of AgNO3 were dissolved in 40 mL of DI water to
prepare 0.05 mol/L solution. There were four contrast samples treated
with PdCl2 and AgNO3 solutions for 0.5 h (PEI-Pd/Ag
0.5), 2 h (PEI-Pd/Ag2), 6 h (PEI-Pd/Ag6), and 24 h (PEI-Pd/Ag24).
As shown in Figures 1 and 2, they demonstrate the different surface
topographies of different reaction times. Then, these different productions
were treated by dialysis and lyophilization for 7 days, and after
that, the dry hydrogels were further tested and analyzed.

4.4 Characterization
The hydrogels were
obtained at −50 °C, using a Beijing Boyikang Experimental
Instrument Co., Ltd. FD-1C-50 lyophilizer, completely removing water
after 5–7 days.46−54 A field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) (S-4800II, Hitachi,
Japan) with 15 kV accelerating voltage and transmission electron microscope
(TEM, HT7700, Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation) were used to
analyze the nanomicroscopic surface of composite hydrogels. Elemental
composition and lattice structure of complexes were determined by
X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a copper Kα X-ray radiation source
and Bragg diffraction X-ray radiation source settings (Smart Lab,
Rigaku, Japan). The valence status and surface elements were analyzed
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos AXIS 165, Kratos
Analytical, Kyoto, Japan). Thermogravimetry (TG) was tested by using
a NETZSCH STA 409 PC Luxxsi multaneous thermal analyzer (Netzsch Instruments
Manufacturing Co, Ltd., Germany) in argon gas. To research the pore
size distribution and specific surface area of hydrogels, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
measurement (BET) (ASAP 2460) was adopted for analysis.

4.5 Catalytic Test of 4-NP
4-NP (0.005
mol/L) and NaBH4 (0.01 mol/L) solutions were prepared for
catalytic experiments. First, 24 mL stock solution of 4-NP was put
into a beaker and transferred a little to a quartz cuvette for testing
the absorbance of ultraviolet wavelength from 200 to 550 nm at room
temperature, Then, 5 mL of fresh NaBH4 was added to the
4-NP solution, and a small amount of mixed solution was put into a
quartz cuvette for testing the absorbance of ultraviolet wavelength
as in the above method. Finally, 0.02 g of different hydrogels with
PdCl2 or AgNO3 was added to the prepared solution
of NaBH4 and 4-NP. The color of the mixed solution changed
from bright yellow to colorless, indicating that the catalysis was
completed.
