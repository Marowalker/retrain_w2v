A hydrothermal (HT) coating was applied
to the biomedical Mg–Zn–Ca
alloy surface by microarc oxidation (MAO) and heat treatment. Then,
the corrosion resistance and biocompatibility of the coated alloy
was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The corrosion rate (CR) of HT-coated
implants was significantly lower in experiment. In addition, this
CR increased over time in vivo but was stable, albeit higher, in vitro.
The proliferation, adhesion, and live activity of bone marrow stem
cells (BMSCs) were significantly greater on the surface of the HT-coated
Mg alloy in vitro. Serum Mg2+ was always within the normal
range in rabbits with implants, although Ca2+ was higher
than normal for both uncoated and coated scaffolds. There were no
significant pathological effects on the main organs of alloy-implanted
rabbits compared with healthy animals. Thus, the HT coating significantly
improved the corrosion resistance and biocompatibility of the Mg–Zn–Ca
alloy.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Magnesium (Mg) and its alloys have attracted much attention in
the production of metallic, biodegradable implants because of their
excellent biocompatibility and mechanical properties.1−3 As well known, the magnesium ion is the fourth most abundant cation
in the body. A healthy adult of 70 kg generally contains about 21–35
g physiological Mg,4 and over half of these
are stored in bone tissue.5,6 Mg is also the second
most abundant cation in cells and is known to be involved in about
300 enzymatic reactions.7,8 Moreover, as an orthopedic
biomaterial, the Young’s coefficient of the Mg alloy is close
to that of human bone, which could effectively reduce or avoid postoperative
complications of stress concentrations and shielding.9 Mg ions could join in many physiological processes when
Mg alloys were degraded to release it in the body.10,11 For example, these Mg ions may enhance bone regeneration by affecting
extracellular matrix proteins and transcription factors, such as BMP-2.12,13 Meanwhile, excessive Mg2+ is excreted through urine or
feces without toxic effects on the body.14 The most important is that the Mg alloy can be adjusted to resorb
after the bone-healing process. This could further reduce the demand
to perform a second surgery to remove it, as well as eradicate the
related complication, including unpleasant infection and expense.15,16

A disadvantage of the Mg alloy is that it has poor corrosion
resistance
in the body because it will degrade to produce Mg(OH)2 and
H2 in aqueous environments.17−19 Mg(OH)2 could
be further converted into highly soluble magnesium chloride (MgCl2) when the Cl– concentration exceeds 30
mM in the surrounding environment.20 This
characteristic can greatly reduce the ultimate strength and fatigue
life of Mg-based implants in the body, which is a major obstacle to
their clinical applications. In addition, rapid degradation of the
Mg alloy can release hydrogen, which can accumulate around the implant
and even lead to subcutaneous emphysema. The hydrogen can also lead
to local alkalization around the implant, which can result in side
effects.18,19 Thus, improvement of the corrosion resistance
of the Mg alloy is necessary to adapt to the needs of clinical applications.

Some methods have been developed to improve the corrosion resistance
of magnesium. For instance, surface coating efficiently increases
the degradation resistance of the Mg alloy,21,22 which is carried out using methods such as microarc oxidation (MAO)23,24 and electrophoresis deposition (EPD).25 Dou et al.26 reported that MAO coatings
adhere tightly to the substrate and result in higher corrosion and
wear resistance, and, therefore, this approach has been widely used
to improve the corrosion resistance of Mg alloys.27−30 Meanwhile, EPD is also an effective
method for improving the degradation resistance of Mg alloys,31,32 as no evaporated gas is involved, and thus pores can be avoided
during the coating process.33 The application
of these technologies can ensure the mechanical integrity of Mg alloys
at the initial stage of implantation. Thus, Mg-based orthopedic equipment
is possible, given that the corrosion of the material can be controlled
in vivo.34 However, both MAO and EPD methods
have some limitations. For example, the major barrier to EPD coatings
was poor adhesion, which to some extent, reduced the corrosion resistance
of the coatings. In addition, our previous research found that micropores
and microcracks exist on the surface of MAO coatings, and thus, over
time, electrolytes can penetrate into the surface of the substrate,
leading to the formation of corrosion cracks.29

To improve the resistance of Mg alloy to corrosion, we have
developed
a hydrothermal (HT) coating that is applied by heat treatment and
MAO methods, and its chemical composition and mechanical properties
were evaluated in our previous study.35 Here, we apply the HT coating to the surface of a Mg–Zn–Ca
alloy and evaluate the biocompatibility and corrosion resistance of
this coated alloy in vitro and in vivo (Figure 1).

2 Results
2.1 Immersion
Testing of the HT-Coated and Uncoated
Mg–Zn–Ca Alloy
The corrosive production was
rinsed to remove by chromic acid solution on the surface of uncoated
and HT-coated Mg–Zn–Ca sample when it was soaked in
the simulated body fluid (SBF) solution after 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21
days, respectively. The gross appearance of samples is shown in Figure 2. The uncoated samples
were completely degraded upon immersion by day 14. Meanwhile, HT-coated
samples remained almost intact on day 14 and had lost about half of
their volume by day 21. The corrosion rate (CR) of samples was calculated
based on their lost weight, as shown in Table 1. At 7 days, the CR of uncoated samples was
higher than that of HT-coated samples. Between 14 and 21 days, the
CR of the coated samples remained stable.

2.2 Indirect Cytotoxicity Analysis of Mg Alloy
Samples in Vitro
For the assessment of indirect cytotoxicity
in vitro, the medium that had been incubated with Mg–Zn–Ca
alloy samples for 3 and 7 days was collected and then used as the
culture medium for bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) for an additional
1, 3, 5, and 7 days. Cell proliferation in the culture medium that
had been preincubated with the coated or uncoated Mg alloy was similar
to that in the control medium (Figure 3). Only after 7 days in culture was there a significant
difference between the control medium and the two preincubated media,
although there was no significant difference in proliferation between
the uncoated and coated groups.

cell proliferation. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01.

Adhesion to HT-Coated and Uncoated Mg
Alloy Samples
Table 2 shows the BMSC cell adhesion percentage for uncoated and
HT-coated Mg–Zn–Ca alloy samples. Briefly, after overnight
incubation, the cell adhesion percentage was calculated by counting
the remaining cells in the solution after removing the samples. The
average cell adhesion percentage for the HT-coated Mg alloy was significantly
higher than that of the uncoated Mg alloy (p <
0.01).

2.4 Direct
Cytoactivity Analysis of Mg Alloy Samples
in Vitro
The viability of cells on scaffolds was analyzed
via live/dead staining (Figure 4) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure 5). When BMSCs were cultured
for 3 or 7 days, almost all cells on the uncoated samples were dead
(Figure 4a,b). Conversely,
there was an abundance of live cells on the coated Mg alloy surface
(Figure 4c,d). In SEM
analysis conducted after 3 and 7 days in culture, the cells on the
uncoated Mg alloy were fusiform at 3 days (Figure 5a) and ellipsosome at 7 days (Figure 5b). In contrast, the cells
on the HT-coated Mg alloy had a spread morphology and appeared to
be more well adhered by 3 days (Figure 5c), and especially at 7 days (Figure 5d).

and HT-coated

and HT-coated Mg alloy (c, d) were seeded with BMSCs and cultured

2.5 X-ray Images in a Rabbit
Model of Bone Defect
X-ray images were then taken at 4, 8,
and 12 weeks after surgery
(Figure 6). Substantial
amounts of radiodense material had accumulated around the Mg alloy
by 4, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery. By week 4, both the coated and
uncoated Mg–Zn–Ca alloy scaffolds were still mostly
intact in the forearms. With the extension to week 8, the uncoated
scaffolds were no longer intact, whereas the HT-coated scaffolds were
intact. At week 12, the uncoated scaffolds could not be identified
within the bone defect, but the HT-coated scaffolds had partially
retained their structure. We also noted that less gas had accumulated
around the HT-coated scaffolds relative to the uncoated scaffolds
at week 8; however, the amount of accumulated hydrogen around the
implants was similar in both groups at 12 weeks. Although the bone
response was not the main purpose of this study, it is particularly
important to note that more mature new bone and calcium deposition
had formed in the regions of the defects around the HT-coated implants
relative to the uncoated implants by fluorescence and histological
sections (Supporting Information Figures S1 and S2).

hydrogen produced by degradation, and the yellow arrow indicates bone
regeneration.

2.6 Microcomputed
Tomography (CT) Analysis of
Mg Alloy Scaffolds in a Rabbit Model
Three-dimensional micro-CT
images (Figure 7) were
then used to calculate the remaining scaffold volume in the operated
rabbits. These findings were consistent with the X-ray image results
and showed that the uncoated alloy degraded more rapidly. In contrast
to the X-ray observations, the accumulation of gas around the HT-coated
scaffolds was substantially higher than that around uncoated scaffolds
at 12 weeks. We calculated the CR for each implant type based on the
CT-measured loss of volume. The CR of the uncoated scaffold was significantly
higher than that of the coated scaffold at 4 and 8 weeks after surgery
(Table 3). In addition,
an intra-group comparison indicated that the CR of the HT-coated scaffold
had significantly increased at 8 weeks relative to 4 weeks and was
significantly higher at 12 weeks than at 8 weeks (Table 3). These results thus differed
from the in vitro findings.

2.7 Hydrogen Formation in Response
to Mg Alloy
Scaffolds in a Rabbit Model
At weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 after
surgery in the rabbit model of large bone defect, hydrogen gas that
had accumulated at the implant site was collected by a subcutaneous
puncture (Figure 8).
The hypodermic bubbles were extracted with a sterile syringe, and
no significant body fluid or serum was extracted at the same time.
The amount of gas associated with the HT-coated Mg alloy scaffolds
was significantly less than that associated with the uncoated scaffolds
at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after surgery. Interestingly, this difference
between the two groups was absent at 12 weeks after surgery (Figure 8).

2.8 Serum
Mg2+ and Ca2+ Concentrations
Figure 9 shows the
serum Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations in the two
treatment groups at three time points after surgery. The serum Mg2+ concentrations of the two groups were within the normal
range (0.82–2.22 mmol/L) over the course of the experiment,
and significant differences were not found between the groups. The
serum Ca2+ concentrations in the two groups tended to be
greater than normal (normal concentrations, 2.1–2.6 mmol/L),
but significant differences between groups were also not found.

Serum Mg2+ (a) and Ca2+ (b) levels were determined
in rabbits that received Mg alloy scaffold implants that were either
uncoated or HT coated. Serum samples were analyzed at weeks 4, 8,
and 12 after surgery.

2.9 Organ
Pathology
Tissue sections from
the liver, brain, kidney, and spleen from the three groups that were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin showed that the structures and
morphologies of the cells were normal (Figure 10). As compared with the control group (untreated
rabbits), the nuclei appeared to be intact and clear, the cytoplasm
appeared to be normal, and no abnormal structural features such as
those associated with necrosis were observed in the HT-coated and
uncoated groups.

3 Discussion
3.1 Corrosion
Resistance of HT-Coated Mg Alloy
in Vitro and in Vivo
In the present study, we adopted heat
treatment techniques to prepare a HT composite layer to improve the
properties of a medical biodegradable Mg alloy. Although we previously
confirmed that the HT coating improves the properties of this Mg alloy,35 its effects on corrosion resistance and biocompatibility
had not been analyzed in vivo or in vitro.

In vitro, the CR
of uncoated Mg–Zn–Ca samples was higher than that of
HT-coated Mg–Zn–Ca samples during the initial 1–7
days of immersion, with the complete corrosion of the sample (and
thus its disappearance) by day 14. The CR of the HT-coated Mg–Zn–Ca
samples was stable during the 21 days of the experiment. This result
is consistent with our previous research.35 The CRs of uncoated and HT-coated Mg samples after implantation
in rabbits showed similar trends relative to those obtained in vitro.
X-ray and micro-CT analyses also showed that the uncoated implants
had disappeared by 12 weeks after surgery, whereas the HT-coated implants
were partially intact. Thus, the HT coating effectively improves the
corrosion resistance of the Mg–Zn–Ca alloy. We think
that this phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that the HT coating
may effectively protect the matrix from the active ions in the body
fluid.36,37

In these experiments, we found an
interesting phenomenon. In vitro,
the CRs of both the uncoated and coated Mg alloys were stable during
the experiment time course, respectively. However, comparing the CR
in HT-coated sample at weeks 4, 8, and 12, we found that it increased
over time in vivo. Meanwhile, the CR of the uncoated Mg alloy remained
stable through week 8. We believe that initially, the HT coating provides
effective protection against corrosion for the Mg alloy matrix. Over
time, however, as the coating is degraded, it loses its protective
function, which leads to acceleration of the degradation of the Mg
matrix. This is supported by the analysis of local hydrogen evolution,
as the volume of local hydrogen gas was significantly lower in the
HT-coated group than in the uncoated group at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after
surgery. Only at 12 weeks was there any difference between the implants
with respect to hydrogen gas production. This could also explain why
there was more residual gas around the implants in the micro-CT images
from HT-coated implants relative to uncoated implants at 12 weeks
after surgery. The uncoated implants had likely corroded to the point
of no longer being present, whereas the HT coating had lost its protective
ability, resulting in acceleration of the degradation of the Mg alloy
matrix.

Finally, we observed that the CRs of all samples were
substantially
lower in vivo than they were in vitro. This is most likely because
there are lower concentrations of chloride ions present in blood plasma
(103 mM)38 and bone (48.6–56.7 mM)39 than in SBF (147.8 mM). In general, because
of electrochemical reactions in metal–fluid systems, the corrosion
processes on Mg alloy can generate corrosion products,40 and the corrosion product Mg(OH)2, as the main component of the corrosion layer, is not stable in
aqueous solutions, which is especially true in chloride-containing
environments.41 The difference noted in
the present study was likely increased by our frequent replacement
of SBF solution based on changes in its pH. Our results were similar
to those from a previous study by Witte et al.,41 who investigated the effects of different environments
on the CRs of AZ91D and LAE442. They found that the CRs from in vivo
tests were about four orders of magnitude smaller than those from
in vitro tests.

3.2 Biocompatibility of HT-Coated
Mg Alloy in
Vitro and in Vivo
The corrosion of Mg alloy results in the
release of hydrogen, which causes local pH changes that have a negative
effect on the surrounding cells and can damage the body’s tissues
and organs.41 Thus, we further evaluated
the effect of the HT coating on the biocompatibility of this Mg–Zn–Ca
alloy.

First, the medium that had been preincubated with the
uncoated or HT-coated Mg alloy samples did not hinder BMSC proliferation
and in fact resulted in higher cell numbers when either the Mg alloy
was preincubated in the medium for 7 days, relative to the untreated
control medium. However, no significant differences were found between
the uncoated and HT-coated groups. Next, through direct contact testing,
we found that the cell adhesion frequency associated with the HT-coated
Mg alloy was higher than that associated with the uncoated Mg alloy.
Meanwhile, the live/dead staining and SEM analysis results showed
that more live cells were observed on the HT-coated Mg alloy surface
than on the uncoated Mg alloy and that the living cells had better
morphology and had attributes consistent with better adhesion on the
coated samples.

We also observed changes in Mg2+ levels,
because the
volume of this novel Mg alloy scaffold is larger and it corrodes more
quickly than devices examined in previous studies.2,3,9−12 The Mg2+ concentration
maintained within the expected physiological range throughout the
experiment. This suggests that the released Mg2+ can be
absorbed in experimental animals. In contrast, we observed that the
serum Ca2+ concentration was higher than the physiological
range. In this rabbit model system, the bone-healing mechanism was
presumably activated. In addition, local accumulation of Mg2+ ions promotes bone calcium deposition, and new bone formation may
have induced an increase in serum Ca2+.42 Mg ions released from implants contribute to bone formation
around the peripheral cortex of cortical bone,43 which may be caused by magnesium ions promoting the expression
of calcitonin gene-related peptides in the periosteum.44 In addition, pathological changes were not observed
in the liver, brain, kidney, and spleen tissues in animals from any
of these treatment groups. These results further demonstrate that
this Mg–Zn–Ca alloy matrix is safe for the body regardless
of its coating. Zn2+ and Ca2+ are microelements
that are present in the human body and are themselves nontoxic. This
is also consistent with earlier reports.45,46

In addition, there are some limitations to this study, such
as
the short time course for the analysis and the quantitative analysis
of local gas production is not accurate. In addition, the limited
time period during which the anticorrosion property of the HT coating
is effective, but the long-term protective effects were required further
improved.

4 Conclusions
In the
present study, we characterized a Mg–Zn–Ca
alloy with a HT coating both in vivo and in vitro. Our results demonstrated
that the HT coating can improve the biocompatibility and corrosion
resistance of this Mg alloy and thus provides useful data for future
studies on Mg alloy biomaterial applications.

5 Materials
and Methods
5.1 Hydrothermal Coat Preparation
As
in our previous studies,29,47 a Mg–Zn–Ca
alloy was used as the initial substrate material, with the major alloying
elements (wt %) consisting of approximately 2.5–3.0% Zn, 0.5–1.5%
Ca, and 0.5% rare element and pure Mg. After cleaning the surface
impurities with an ultrasonic bath, all samples were washed with distilled
water after polishing with sandpaper (400-, 800-, and 1200-grit) and
dried at room temperature for further use.

The 10-μm-thick
MAO bottom bioceramic layers were produced according to the method
we previously described.35 In brief, the
Mg–Zn–Ca samples and the stainless steel were used as
the anode and cathode, which were placed in mixing solution of 10
g/L NaOH, 15 g/L Na2SiO3, and 10 g/L Ca(H2PO4)2, Pulse frequency and duty cycle
were fixed at 600 Hz and 8%. The temperature of the electrolyte was
kept nearly at 30 °C using a stirring and cooling system. The
MAO bottom ceramic layers were produced at a constant voltage of 450
V for 10 min.

To seal any micropores or microcracks on the MAO
surface and improve
the resistance of the sample to corrosion, a bioactive hydrothermal
duplex layer was placed over the MAO layer by the heat treatment method,
which was measured to be 60 μm thick in our previous research.47 In brief, the MAO-coated samples were placed
in the autoclave (volume 40 mL), which included 20 mL distilled water
of Ca(NO3)2·4H2O and KH2PO4·3H2O and the pH was controlled to 3 by dilute
nitric acid and heated to 150 °C for 10 h. This composite coating
is referred to as the hydrothermal (HT) coating.

5.2 HT-Coated Samples for in Vitro Testing
Samples of the
HT-coated or uncoated Mg–Zn–Ca alloy
were machined into square plates with a length of 10 mm and thickness
of 1 mm and subjected to ethylene-oxide gas sterilization for further
research. The control group consisted of samples of the uncoated Mg–Zn–Ca
alloy.

5.2.1 Immersion Test
Each sample was
weighed before the immersion test. Then, samples were immersed in
50 mL simulated body fluid (SBF) solution (pH = 7.4) in a culture
bottle (37 °C) for 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days. Every 24 h, the
pH of the SBF solution was determined, and the solution was replaced
when the pH value was >8.5. The weight of the sample was determined
at different times during the immersion. The corrosion rate (CR) of
the HT-coated and uncoated Mg–Zn–Ca alloy samples was
calculated as follows 1  where CR is the corrosion rate in units of
millimeters per year, m0 is the initial
mass and m is the residual mass of a sample at different
times, D is the density of Mg alloy, A is the surface area of the sample, and t is the
immersion time (in years).

5.2.2 Isolation and Culture
of BMSCs
Bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) are considered to
be multipotent,
which allows them to differentiate into several cell lineages, including
type II chondrocytes, adipocytes, and osteoblasts/osteocytes.48 BMSCs were isolated and cultured, as described
in our previous research.49 Briefly, New
Zealand white rabbits (25 d after birth) were euthanized via an overdose
injection of pentobarbital, and their bilateral femurs were then removed.
The bone marrow was flushed from the femurs with Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (HyClone). After centrifugation,
the sediment was resuspended in the culture medium, consisting of
DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
(Beyotime, Shanghai, China), and then cultured in culture bottles
(37 °C, 5% CO2 atmosphere, 95% humidity). Two days
later, the nonadherent cells were removed, and the adherent cells
were further cultured until 80–90% confluent and then were
passaged. After the third passage, the cells were collected for further
testing.

5.2.3 Indirect Cytotoxicity
Samples of
the Mg–Zn–Ca alloy were machined into round plates with
a diameter of 10 mm and thickness of 2 mm. The Mg alloy disc was immersed
in 5 mL of culture medium in a culture bottle at 4 °C for 3 and
7 days. We removed the sample and collected the medium to dilute to
50% for subsequent cell culture. BMSCs were cultured at a density
of 2 × 103 cells/well in a 96-well plate with a medium
that had been preincubated with the uncoated Mg alloy or with the
HT-coated Mg alloy or with control medium that had not been incubated
with an alloy sample. The cells were analyzed after 1, 3, 5, and 7
days in culture using a CCK-8 assay kit (Biosharp, China). Optical
density (OD) values measured the absorbency of cells at 450 nm, with
higher absorbency values indicating the presence of more cells. This
procedure was repeated three times for each well.

5.2.4 Cell Adhesion
Each Mg alloy disc
was immersed in the medium for 2 h for pretreatment. The sample was
then mixed with 3 mL of medium with 1 × 105 BMSCs
and incubated overnight on a shaking table to assess the dynamic attachment
of cells to uncoated and coated Mg alloy disks. The cell-seeded disks
were transferred to a 6-well plate and further cultured 3 and 7 days
to use for further live/dead test. Then, the nonadherent cells remaining
in the medium and the number of adherent cells were counted (n = adherent cells) with the Cell counter (AP-0810401, MARIENFELD,
Germany). The cell adhesion percentage for each scaffold was determined
as (1 × 105 – n)/(1 ×
105) × 100.

5.2.5 Direct
Cytoactivity
The viability
of cells on disks was analyzed using a live/dead staining kit (Wei
Kai, Tianjin, China). Cell-seeded scaffolds were further cultured
in the medium, and the medium was refreshed every 2 days. After 3
and 7 days, live/dead staining was performed. Briefly, the kit contains
two reagents, calcein AM and EthD-1. When cells are cultured in the
medium containing FBS, calcein AM, and EthD-1, calcein AM enters into
live cells and serves as the substrate for a specific enzyme. The
resulting calcein fluorescent molecules remain within live cells,
so live cells appear green. EthD-1 cannot pass the cytomembrane, but
it can enter into dead cells, where it binds DNA and becomes highly
fluorescent, such that dead cells appear red. Simultaneously, scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) (S-4300, Hitachi, Japan) was carried out
on parallel samples to observe cells attached to the disks.

5.3 Design of the Mg Alloy Scaffold for in Vivo
Testing
The Mg alloy scaffold was manufactured using a die-cast
technique as a cylinder with the following dimensions: length, 15
mm; outer diameter, 5 mm; inner diameter, 3 mm; and with 12 holes
of 1 mm in diameter drilled into the outside wall (Figure 1a,b). Each scaffold was sterilized
under ethylene-oxide gas47 before implantation.

5.3.1 Surgical Procedure
This study was
approved by the Harbin Medical University Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee. Thirty-six pathogen-free adult New Zealand white
rabbits (2.5–3.0 kg) were randomly placed into one of two groups
(n = 18/group), that were provided by Animal Experiment
Center of Harbin Medical University. The surgical procedure used was
as described in our previous study.47 Briefly,
the rabbits were intravenously anesthetized with 3% (w/v) pentobarbital
sodium (30 mg/kg). Then, the rabbit’s forearms were shaved
and disinfected before an incision was made to expose the ulna. A
15 mm ulna osteotomy was performed to create a critical bone defect.
HT-coated or uncoated Mg–Zn–Ca alloy scaffolds (Figure 1a,b) were filled
with granular bone and then carefully implanted into the ulna defect
(Figure 1c). At 4,
8, and 12 weeks after surgery, the animals (n = 6/group)
were sacrificed after being anesthetized. collected forearms (n = 12/group) were stored at −20 °C for further
testing.

5.3.2 X-ray Imaging
The X-ray images
of the bone defect at 4, 8, and 12 weeks were obtained by an X-ray
scanner (Faxitron; 110 kV; anode current, 500 μA). Then. degradation
of the scaffold and bone regeneration was evaluated in each rabbit
by these images.

5.3.3 Microcomputed Tomography
(CT)
The
two-dimensional (2-D) image of forearms was scanned using micro-CT
(Siemens Medical Solutions, Germany, with 80 kV source voltage and
500 μA source current). Then, reconstructions were performed
using Inveon software (Siemens Medical Solutions) and resulted in
grayscale images. CT thresholding was performed to enhance the contrast
of ossified tissues. The acquired two-dimensional lateral projections
were analyzed using Inveon software. The residual scaffold was decisived
by three-dimensional morphometric analysis, and the correlated CR
was calculated using the Mg volume loss as follows 2  where
CR is the corrosion rate in millimeters
per year, V0 is the initial volume of
the scaffold and V is the current volume of the scaffold
(both in millimeters cubed), A is the surface area
of the scaffold (in millimeters squared), and t is
time (in years).

5.3.4 Subcutaneous Gas
In an in vivo
situation, production of hydrogen gas is accompanied by Mg alloy corrosion
with the following formula 3  Basically, 1 mol of hydrogen gas will be produced
with the dissolution of 1 mol of Mg.50 Hydrogen
bubbles accumulate in the local host tissue if corrosion rates of
Mg or Mg alloy implants are too high. Thus, the animal was anesthetized
as described above, and the subcutaneous gas present was punctured
to collect in a syringe using a LOGIQ 7 color-Doppler ultrasound diagnostic
system (GE), which was used to indirectly evaluate degradation of
the scaffold.

5.3.5 Serum Mg2+ and Ca2+ Concentrations
Peripheral blood from
each rabbit was collected
in a heparinized tube to determine the Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations before being sacrificed. Each sample (5–9
mL/animal) was centrifuged (3500 rpm, 10 min) at room temperature,
after which the serum was retained. The serum Mg and Ca concentrations
(reference ranges: 0.82–2.22 and 2.1–2.6 mM, respectively)
were measured using a Hitachi 7600 automatic clinical chemistry analyzer
(Hitachi Limited, Japan).

5.3.6 Pathology
Healthy
rabbits were
used as the control group. The livers, heads, and kidneys of all animals
were pathologically examined shortly after they were sacrificed. The
samples were fixed in 10% (w/v) formalin (Beijing Yili, China) and
embedded in paraffin. Each specimen was sectioned (5 μm thick),
and deparaffinized sections were stained with the hematoxylin–eosin
(HE) method. Then, the samples were visualized and photographs were
taken through an Olympus CKX41 optical microscope (Japan) to evaluate
systemic toxicity.

5.4 Statistical Analysis
GraphPad Prism
6.0 software (GraphPad Prism) was used to analyze data. All data are
expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Analysis
of variance (ANOVA) and factorial design ANOVA were used, and p < 0.05 was considered significant.
