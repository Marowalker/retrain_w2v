G-protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs) are seven transmembrane spanning
receptors that regulate a wide array of intracellular signaling cascades
in response to various stimuli. To do so, they couple to different
heterotrimeric G proteins and adaptor proteins, including arrestins.
Importantly, arrestins were shown to regulate GPCR signaling through
G proteins, as well as promote G protein-independent signaling events.
Several research groups have reported successful isolation of exclusively
G protein-dependent and arrestin-dependent signaling downstream of
GPCR activation using biased agonists or receptor mutants incapable
of coupling to either arrestins or G proteins. In the latter category,
the DRY mutant of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor was extensively
used to characterize the functional selectivity downstream of AT1AR. In an attempt to understand histamine 1 receptor signaling,
we characterized the signaling capacity of the H1R DRY mutant in a
panel of dynamic, live cell biosensor assays, including arrestin recruitment,
heterotrimeric G protein activation, Ca2+ signaling, protein
kinase C activity, GTP binding of RhoA, and activation of ERK1/2.
Here, we show that both H1R DRY mutant and the AT1AR DRY
mutant are capable of efficient
activation of G protein-mediated signaling. Therefore, contrary to
the common belief, they do not constitute suitable tools for the dissection
of the arrestin-mediated, G protein-independent signaling downstream
of these receptors.

Introduction
G protein-coupled receptors
(GPCRs) constitute the largest family
of cell surface proteins involved in signaling in response to various
stimuli that underlie many cellular and physiological processes. Agonist
binding to GPCRs evokes rearrangements in the intramolecular interactions
within the seven transmembrane domain structure of the receptor that
result in receptor activation and its coupling to heterotrimeric (Gαßγ)
G proteins.1 This leads to G protein activation
and switching of the canonical GPCR signaling via second messengers.
Subsequent cessation of this G protein-dependent signaling occurs
via the recruitment of arrestins to the cytoplasmic surface of the
receptor, a process that is enhanced by receptor phosphorylation by
G protein-coupled receptor kinases, GRKs.2,3 Of
four arrestin isoforms, arrestin1 and 4 bind photoreceptors in the
retina, whereas two nonvisual arrestins (arrestin2 and 3 or ß-arrestin1
and 2, respectively) bind virtually all other GPCRs. Arrestin binding
physically prevents the receptor–G protein interaction, leading
to desensitization of the receptor-mediated activation of G proteins,
and promotes the subsequent receptor endocytosis via clathrin-coated
vesicles4−6

In addition to desensitization, arrestin binding
to the receptor
was proposed to “switch” the receptor from the G protein
signaling mode that transmits transient signals from the plasma membrane
to an arrestin signaling mode that transmits a distinct set of signals
as the receptor internalizes.7,8 Arrestin-mediated signaling
downstream of GPCR activation is arguably the most thoroughly studied
in the case of mitogen-activated, extracellular signal-regulated kinase
1 and 2 (ERK1/2) cascades. In fact, several research groups have reported
the successful “isolation” of G protein-independent
ß-arrestin-mediated signaling downstream of GPCR activation using
the so-called ß-arrestin-biased agonists, i.e., compounds that
do not support receptor coupling to G proteins.9−13 Similarly, receptor mutants incapable of G protein
coupling have been used to isolate G protein-independent ß-arrestin
effects.14−16

Uncoupling from G protein activation was achieved
for several receptors
by mutating the highly conserved DRY motif found in all rhodopsin/family
A GPCRs.17−19 The DRY motif, located at the cytoplasmic end of
the third transmembrane helix (TM3), participates in an ionic lock
with Glu in TM6 to stabilize the inactive conformation, as separation
of the cytoplasmic parts of TM3 and TM6 is required for GPCR activation.1,20,21 Interestingly, the prevention
of this movement selectively abrogated G protein activation by the
parathyroid hormone receptor22,23 but not GRK2-mediated
receptor phosphorylation or ß-arrestin recruitment. Functional
selectivity proposes that the receptor can adopt multiple conformations
upon ligand binding, which in turn facilitate a selective activation
of either G protein or ß-arrestin-dependent signaling pathways.12,13,24,25 In this view, charge neutralizing mutations within the DRY motif
would apparently result in the G protein-uncoupled receptor, which
is, however, still capable of ß-arrestin binding and supporting
ß-arrestin-mediated signaling.

In our attempt to elucidate
the possibility of functional selectivity
downstream of the histamine 1 receptor (H1R), we engineered and characterized
a H1R DRY mutant with the conserved Asp and Arg residues of the DRY
motif simultaneously replaced with Ala residues. As the DRY to AAY
mutation that supposedly uncouples GPCR from G protein-mediated signaling
was first described for the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1AR), we included the AT1AR DRY mutant in our analyses.
We evaluated the subcellular localization and signaling capacity of
both DRY mutants using different fluorescence resonance energy-transfer
(FRET)-based live cell assays. A detailed comparison of the signaling
dynamics downstream of the receptor was carried out. Our study sheds
new light on the use of DRY mutants for studying G protein-independent
signaling.

Results
Subcellular Localization of WT and DRY Mutants
of H1R and AT1AR
First, we evaluated the subcellular
localization
of H1R DRY and AT1AR DRY mutants in living cells using
confocal microscopy. To this end, H1R and AT1AR sequences
were fused at their C-terminus with a red fluorescent protein (RFP),
mCherry (mCh), whereas H1R DRY and AT1AR DRY sequences
were fused similarly to a cyan fluorescent protein, mTurquoise2 (mTQ2).
H1R DRY-mTQ2 and AT1AR DRY-mTQ2 were coexpressed with the plasma membrane
marker (Lck-mVenus) and, respectively, H1R-mCh or AT1AR-mCh
in the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293TN cells. Both H1R DRY and
AT1AR DRY mutants showed largely overlapping subcellular
localization with the respective WT receptors (Pearson’s coefficients
were 0.62 and 0.80 for H1 receptors and AT1A receptors,
respectively): they were located at the plasma membrane as well as
in the intracellular (presumably endocytic) compartments. Plasma membrane
localization of WT and (to a lesser extent) DRY mutants of H1R (Figure 1A shows a representative
cell), as well as AT1AR and AT1AR DRY (Figure 1B shows a representative
cell), was confirmed in the colocalization analysis with the plasma
membrane marker. The localization of WT and DRY mutants of H1R in
the endosomal compartment was examined by the colocalization analysis
with the endosomal marker, Rab7.26,27 To this end,
H1R-mCh or H1R DRY-mCh were coexpressed with Lck-mVenus and mTQ2-Rab7
in HeLa cells. Colocalization with Rab7, indicating endosomal localization,
was more pronounced in the case of H1R DRY receptor (Pearson’s
coefficient of 0.67) than that of the WT H1R (Pearson’s coefficient
of 0.45; Figure 1C,D
shows the representative cells).

β-Arrestin Recruitment to WT and DRY Mutants of H1R and
AT1AR
To examine whether the DRY mutants are capable
of recruiting ß-arrestins, we coexpressed WT or mutant receptors
together with Lck-mVenus and ß-arr1 or ß-arr2 fused at their
C-terminus with mTQ2 in HEK293TN cells. In agreement with the previous
reports,28 we observed a uniform cytosolic
localization of both ß-arrestin fusions, with ßarr1-mTQ2
but not ßarr2-mTQ2, showing additional nuclear localization (Figure 2). We observed rapid
relocation of both isoforms to the cell periphery upon stimulation
of H1R-expressing cells with 100 μM histamine and weak ß-arrestin
relocation in H1R DRY-expressing cells (Figure 2A–D). For quantification of the recruitment,
see Figure 2E. Recruitment
was visible as the histamine-induced localization of ß-arrestin
in discrete puncta at and near the plasma membrane (as indicated by
their colocalization with Lck-mVenus; Figure 2F,G) and was fully reversed upon addition
of a H1R-specific antagonist, pyrilamine (PY) (see Supporting Information Movies S1–S4). In the case of both WT
and DRY mutants of AT1AR, stimulation with 1 μM angiotensin
II (AngII) resulted in very robust and rapid ß-arr1 and ß-arr2
relocations to the plasma membrane (as indicated by their colocalization
with Lck-mVenus; see Pearson’s coefficients in Figure 3) and subsequently to an endosomal
compartment (Figure 3A–G; see Supporting Information Movies S5–S8), in agreement with the previous reports.17,18,28,29

Gq Activation by WT and DRY Mutants of H1R and AT1AR
Having established correct localization and the
capacity to recruit β-arrestins for both the WT and the DRY
mutants, we characterized the functional activity of H1R DRY and AT1AR DRY mutants in a subset of signaling pathways. Both H1R
and AT1AR can couple to Gq/11 and Gi proteins.30−34 The coupling of WT and DRY mutants to Gq proteins was
evaluated using a FRET reporter for Gq activation.35,36 Stimulation of HEK293TN cells expressing only the reporter with
100 μM histamine or 1 μM AngII did not result in any detectable
FRET ratio change (Figure 4A; see Supporting Information Figure S1A for individual measurements of all cells). On the contrary, the
robust agonist-induced FRET signal was measured in cells coexpressing
H1R-p2A-mCh (see Materials and Methods) or
AT1AR-p2A-mCh together with the Gq reporter.
Surprisingly, also the stimulation of cells expressing H1R DRY-p2A-mCh
and AT1AR DRY-p2A-mCh resulted in reproducible FRET signals, although
they were much reduced in comparison to the responses mediated by
the respective WT receptors: H1R DRY- and AT1AR DRY-mediated
FRET signals reached, respectively, 12 and 17% of the WT response.
A limitation of this assay is that it requires overexpression of the
Gq heterotrimer, i.e., Gαq-mTQ, Gß1, and YFP-Gγ2. Still, our results demonstrate
that the DRY mutants have a guanine exchange factor activity toward
a heterotrimeric G protein.

(100 μM) (upper panel) or 1 μM AngII (lower panel) was
added at 38 s, and 100 nM phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (a potent
PKC activator) was added at 338 s. Gray boxes mark the duration of,
respectively, histamine or AngII stimulation. The observed PKC activation
was abolished with a specific PKC inhibitor (10 μM Ro31-8425; N = 15 for histamine, N = 20 for AngII).

Calcium and PKC Signaling
Downstream of WT and DRY Mutants of
H1R and AT1AR
Gq/11 protein-mediated
activation of phospholipase Cß results in the triggering of inositol
triphosphate signaling and Ca2+-dependent protein kinase
C (PKC) pathway. To evaluate the Gq coupling of the DRY
mutants in the absence of the Gq protein overexpression,
we subsequently employed FRET reporters for Ca2+- and PKC-dependent
phosphorylation. Calcium signaling was monitored with the Yellow Chameleon
3.60 (YC3.6) FRET reporter (Figure 4B; Supporting Information Figure S1B). The stimulation of HEK293TN cells coexpressing the reporter
and WT H1R or AT1AR with appropriate agonists resulted
in an immediate sharp increase of intracellular Ca2+ levels
that subsequently decreased in a biphasic mode: the initial fast drop
(to approximately 50–60% of the maximum) within 60 s of stimulation
followed by a much slower decrease. Stimulation of cells coexpressing
the reporter and AT1AR DRY mutant receptors with 1 μM
AngII resulted in a similarly sharp increase of intracellular Ca2+ levels, although the response had lower amplitude and was
more transient (returned to baseline within 60 s of the stimulation).

The histamine-induced YC3.6 signal in cells coexpressing the reporter
and H1R DRY receptors was also much reduced in comparison to the H1R-mediated
response and showed more oscillatory character (see Supporting Information Figure S1B). To quantify the YC3.6 signals, we
integrated all values after the addition of the agonist and divided
them by the number of cells measured: H1R DRY- and AT1AR DRY-mediated YC3.6 signals were, respectively, 21 and 17% of the
WT response. We occasionally measured Ca2+ increases in
the absence of overexpressed receptors in cells. Of 57 cells, only
9 responded to 100 μM histamine, and of 24 cells, 7 cells responded
to 1 μM AngII (Supporting Information Figure S1B). These sporadic YC3.6 signals could result from the activation
of endogenous H1R, H2R, or AT1AR (presumably) expressed
in HEK293TN cells.32 However, the YC3.6
signals measured in cells coexpressing the YC3.6 sensor and H1R DRY
or AT1AR DRY mutant receptors were clearly different from
these endogenous responses, both in kinetics and the percentage of
responsive cells (>95%).

Next, the PKC activation was studied
with the CKAR FRET reporter.
We observed robust agonist-induced FRET ratio changes in cells coexpressing
H1R or AT1AR together with CKAR but not in cells expressing
only the reporter (Figure 4C; Supporting Information Figure S1C). We have confirmed that the observed PKC activity was Gq-protein-mediated, as the CKAR signal could be abolished with a Gαq-specific inhibitor, FR900359.37 The CKAR signal was similarly abolished using a PKC-specific inhibitor,
Ro31-8425. Using this reporter, we confirmed the ability of H1R DRY
and AT1AR DRY to couple to Gq proteins: the
peak of activity reached approximately 50% (for H1R DRY) or 60% (for
AT1AR DRY) of the WT-receptor-mediated response and returned
faster to the baseline values (Figure 4C).

Together, these results point to the activation
of Gq signaling by DRY mutants of the H1R and AT1AR, albeit
at reduced levels compared to their WT counterparts.

RhoA Signaling
Downstream of WT and DRY Mutants of H1R and AT1AR
As both H1 and AT1A receptors can activate
Rho GTPase, RhoA, via the G-protein (Gq/11 for H1R, G12/13 for AT1AR)-dependent pathway,33,38 we characterized the capacity of WT and DRY mutants for RhoA activation
using a DORA-RhoA FRET sensor.38 A limitation
of this assay is that it requires the overexpression of the RhoA biosensor,
resulting in elevated levels of RhoA. The stimulation of cells expressing
only the reporter with 100 μM histamine or 1 μM AngII
did not result in any detectable FRET ratio change (Figure 4D; Supporting Information Figure S1D). On the contrary, the robust agonist-induced
FRET signal was measured in cells coexpressing H1R or AT1AR together with the reporter. The stimulation of cells coexpressing
the reporter and H1R DRY or AT1AR DRY receptors also resulted
in FRET ratio changes, although these FRET signals were much weaker
than those mediated by the respective WT receptors (decreased to 8
and 5% for the H1R DRY and AT1AR DRY receptors, respectively).
These results are in line with the aforementioned activation of the
classical Gq effectors, calcium and PKC, downstream of
H1R DRY or AT1AR DRY.

Gi Activation
by WT and DRY Mutants of AT1AR and H1R
Additionally,
we evaluated the ability of H1R
DRY and AT1AR DRY receptors to activate Gi protein
using a FRET sensor for Gi1 activation.31 The stimulation of cells expressing only the Gi reporter with 100 μM histamine or 1 μM AngII did not
result in any detectable FRET ratio change, whereas the robust agonist-induced
FRET ratio change was measured in cells coexpressing the receptor
(H1R or AT1AR) together with the reporter (Figure 4E; Supporting Information Figure S1E). On the contrary, the stimulation
of cells expressing H1R DRY and AT1AR DRY mutant receptors
did not result in detectable FRET ratio changes. Similar to the analysis
using the Gq sensor, the activity of the DRY mutants on
the Gi1 protein required overexpression of the Gi heterotrimer.

ERK Activation by WT and DRY Mutants of H1R
and AT1AR
Finally, we characterized the ability
of H1R DRY and AT1AR DRY receptors to activate the cytosolic
and nuclear pool
of ERK1/2 using FRET reporters, respectively, EKARcyt and EKARnuc.39 The localization of the reporters is shown in Figure 5A. To measure both
fast and late phases of ERK-mediated phosphorylation, we monitored
EKAR signals for more than 20 min. The stimulation of cells expressing
only the EKARcyt reporter with 100 μM histamine or 1 μM
AngII did not result in any FRET signal above the baseline (Figure 5B,D; Supporting Information Figure S2). In fact, we observed a transient
drop (25% of maximal value) of the FRET ratio change in cells expressing
only this sensor immediately after histamine stimulation. In cells
expressing only the EKARnuc reporter and stimulated with 100 μM
histamine or 1 μM AngII, the FRET ratio change stayed constant
or showed a slight increase (Figure 5C,E; Supporting Information Figure S2), rather than showing a gradual drop due to mild photobleaching
(observed in vehicle-stimulated cells). This could indicate some weak
agonist-induced phosphorylation of the EKARnuc reporter.

was added at 90 s; gray boxes mark the duration of AngII stimulation.

On the contrary, we measured robust FRET signals
with both EKARcyt
and EKARnuc reporters in cells coexpressing the sensor together with
H1R or AT1AR and stimulated with the respective agonist.
In the case of H1R-mediated ERK1/2 activation, EKARcyt and EKARnuc
signals showed similar kinetics but differed in amplitude (Figure 5B,C; Supporting Information Figure S2A), with the EKARnuc signal being approximately
50% higher than the EKARcyt signal. Both signals showed a transient
drop immediately after histamine addition. Subsequently, both signals
rose sharply, reaching maximal levels approx. 5 min after histamine
addition and then started to slowly decay. H1R DRY-mediated ERK activation,
although reduced, resembled the response downstream of WT H1R (Figure 5B,C; Supporting Information Figure S2A): both EKARcyt and EKARnuc signals
showed an initial drop, after which they started increasing, reaching
more than 50% of the respective H1R-mediated responses within 5 min
of histamine addition. H1R DRY-mediated EKAR signals showed, however,
a much faster decline than the H1R-mediated signals. Treatment with
a specific Gq protein inhibitor, YM254890,40 reduced H1R-mediated EKARcyt signals (Figure 5B), in agreement with the Gq-dependent
activation of the ERK pathway downstream of H1R.41 Interestingly, inhibition with YM254890 completely abolished
the EKARcyt signal in cells expressing H1R DRY receptors (Figure 5B), suggesting that
the ERK signal induced by the DRY mutant requires the activation of
Gq.

The stimulation of cells expressing EKARcyt or EKARnuc reporter
and AT1AR with 1 μM AngII (Figure 5D,E; Supporting Information Figure 2B) resulted in EKAR signals resembling histamine-induced
responses of H1R-expressing cells. However, AngII-induced responses
differed in amplitude from the respective histamine-induced responses
(the AngII-induced EKARcyt signal being higher and the EKARnuc signal
being lower) and showed slower decay. Both EKARcyt and EKARnuc signals
showed similar kinetics and amplitude, although a transient drop (13%
of maximal value) immediately upon AngII addition was observed only
with the former reporter. Cells expressing AT1AR DRY and
stimulated with AngII were able to activate the cytosolic ERK pool
to approximately 80% of the respective AT1AR response (Figure 5D; Supporting Information Figure 2B). We did not measure any AT1AR DRY-mediated EKARnuc signal above the response of cells expressing
only the EKARnuc reporter and stimulated with AngII. Both AT1AR- and AT1AR DRY-mediated EKARcyt signals were
reduced in YM254890-treated cells (Figure 5D).

Discussion
Engineered
GPCRs that have a mutation in the DRY motif have been
proposed as tools to study G protein-independent signaling. It is
important to verify to what extent mutations in the DRY motif inhibit
G protein signaling. Here, we report the signaling dynamics of two
class A receptors, H1R and AT1AR, in which the DRY motif
is changed to AAY. Our results demonstrate that DRY mutants of H1R
and AT1AR are capable of activating heterotrimeric G proteins,
resulting in downstream signaling, including ERK activation.

The DRY motif in AT1AR is required for receptor activation,
although there are contradictory results regarding the level of impairment
achieved with identical or similar mutations. Ohyama and colleagues42 using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells reported
a severe reduction in the G protein coupling (as indicated by the
insensitivity of AngII binding to GTPγS) and inositol phosphate
(IP) production for AT1AR mutants with either Asp125 or
Arg126 residue replaced by either Ala or Gly. On the contrary, Gaborik
and colleagues29 using COS-7 cells observed
severe impairment of IP production and ERK1/2-dependent Elk1 promoter
activation only with a double DRY/AAY mutant. Importantly, AT1AR DRY/AAY or DRY/GGY double mutants expressed in HEK293 or
COS-7 cells were reported to be unable to activate G protein (measured
at the level of 35SGTPγS binding, IP production,
or Ca2+ accumulation) but capable of ß-arrestin recruitment
and ERK1/2 activation.17−19 However, the residual activity (approx. 25% of the
WT response measured at the maximal value) of the DRY/AAY mutant in
the FLIPR assay that measures increases of intracellular Ca2+ levels was observed.18 Additionally,
Bonde and colleagues19 reported increased
Sar1–Ile4–Ile8 (SII)
AngII-induced IP production downstream of DRY/AAY mutant activation
compared to WT AT1AR in COS-7 cells, indicating the ability
of this receptor mutant to couple to the Gq/11 protein.

Here, we observed substantial, albeit reduced compared to WT receptor
responses, Gq protein coupling of H1R DRY and AT1AR DRY mutants in HEK293TN cells using the Gq FRET reporter.
The fact that we did not observe similar coupling of these mutants
to Gi1 could suggest signaling bias (preference for Gq coupling over Gi1). However, it could also result
from a lower dynamic range of the Gi1 FRET reporter. The
observed H1R DRY and AT1AR DRY couplings to the Gq protein were achieved in cells transiently expressing all three
subunits of the Gq heterotrimer. Previously, the overexpression
of the Gαq protein was shown to increase AngII-induced
signaling for all tested AT1AR mutants except the DRY/AAY
mutant.19 To confirm the coupling of these
receptor mutants to the Gq protein in the absence of its
overexpression, we characterized the signaling ability of H1R DRY
and AT1AR DRY receptors using FRET reporters for Gq effectors, i.e., PKC and Ca2+. Both CKAR and YC3.6
sensors reported efficient coupling of H1R DRY and AT1AR DRY mutants to the Gq protein. Signaling efficiencies
of these mutant receptors measured with CKAR and YC3.6 sensors were
increased in comparison to the Gq FRET signal, likely as
a result of the amplification of the signaling outcome downstream
of the initial (reduced) coupling of these receptor mutants to the
Gq proteins.

H1R DRY and AT1AR DRY receptors
were also able to weakly
activate RhoA. Endogenous H1 receptors in HeLa cells were shown to
activate RhoA through the p63RhoGEF- or Trio-mediated, Gq protein-dependent mechanism.38 Similarly,
AT1AR was shown to increase the RhoA activity via the G12/13-dependent, RhoGEF-mediated pathway in vascular smooth
muscle cells and in cardiac myocytes in culture and in vivo.43 However, Bregeon and colleagues44 have recently demonstrated the G protein-independent activation
of RhoA downstream of AT1AR in cultured vascular smooth
muscle cells. As we have not investigated the ability of H1R DRY and
AT1AR DRY mutants to activate RhoA in the presence of Gq or G12/13 protein inhibitors (FR900359 and RGS
domains of p115RhoGEF, respectively), we cannot currently conclude
on the mechanism of this activation.

Taken together, our results
demonstrate the ability of H1R DRY
and AT1AR DRY mutant receptors to signal via Gq proteins, with the strength of the signal strongly depending on
the signaling event tested (with more downstream effectors showing
higher signals due to the signal amplification). At the same time,
we have noted a very transient character of this Gq coupling
of the DRY mutants: histamine-induced Gq and CKAR signals,
as well as AngII-induced CKAR and YC3.6 signals, decayed within a
minute of agonist stimulation. Such transient signals would likely
be missed or blunted in the conventional biochemical assays that generally
have a poor temporal resolution. Therefore, our results once again
demonstrate the strength of single-cell imaging using biosensors.45

With respect to the ß-arrestin recruitment,
we observed agonist-induced
relocation of both ß-arrestin isoforms to the cell periphery
of H1R DRY- and AT1AR DRY-expressing HEK293TN cells. H1R
DRY- and AT1AR DRY-mediated relocations were, however,
less robust than the ß-arrestin recruitment upon WT receptor
activation. Previously, the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer
between the ßarr2-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein
and AT1AR DRY fusion to Renilla luciferase, indicating
receptor–ßarr2 interaction (or at least close proximity),
was reported by Bonde and colleagues.19 The agonist-induced relocation of ßarr1- and/or ßarr2-GFP
fusion proteins in AT1AR- and AT1AR DRY-expressing
cells was also demonstrated using confocal microscopy.17,18 Both research groups showed the change in ß-arrestin cellular
distribution, from uniformly cytosolic to presumably sequestered in
the endocytotic compartment, upon agonist stimulation. However, this
redistribution was only demonstrated after 30 min of stimulation and
in fixed cells. On the contrary, our results showed the agonist-induced
relocation of both ß-arrestin isoforms to the cell periphery
as early as 2 min of stimulation. Additionally, we reported an overlap
of ß-arrestin puncta with the receptor location at the cell periphery
and, in the case of AT1AR- and AT1AR DRY-expressing
cells, also in the intracellular (presumably endosomal) compartment,
indicating colocalization of ß-arrestin and receptor fluorescent
fusions.

Finally, we confirmed the ability of WT and DRY mutant
receptors
to activate ERK. Importantly, AngII-induced EKAR signals (both EKARcyt
and EKARnuc), reporting on ERK-mediated phosphorylation, significantly
resembled AngII-induced ERK phosphorylation demonstrated in HEK293
cells stably expressing AT1AR using conventional immunoblotting.46 We similarly observed an immediate increase
of phosphorylation upon 1 μM AngII addition, reaching a maximum
value at 5 min of stimulation, and followed by slow decay. Therefore,
our results support the notion that EKAR sensors can faithfully report
ERK activation in living cells. An intriguing observation was the
transient drop in histamine-induced EKARcyt and EKARnuc signals, as
well as the AngII-induced EKARcyt signal, indicating agonist-induced
transient inhibition of ERK activity or dephosphorylation of the existing
phosphoERK pool.

The G protein-dependent and ßarrestin-dependent
ERK activations
were postulated to differ with respect to both its kinetics and spatial
distribution.15,46−49 In HEK293 cells expressing the
AT1AR, beta2 adrenergic receptor, or vasopressin V2 receptor,
G protein-dependent activation was reported to be rapid in onset but
transient (with most of the signal waning within 10 min of stimulation)
and to generate phosphorylated ERK distributed throughout the cytosol
and nucleus. On the contrary, the ßarrestin-dependent component
was reported to reach a maximum at 10 min, persist for at least 30
min without attenuation, and activate only the cytosolic ERK1/2 pool.

We measured reproducible agonist-induced EKARcyt signals downstream
of both H1R DRY and AT1AR DRY. Importantly, the H1R DRY-mediated
EKARcyt signal was fully abolished in the absence of Gq protein activation. Treatment with the Gq protein inhibitor, YM254890,
reduced the AT1AR DRY-mediated EKARcyt signal, also indicating
its partial dependence on G protein activation. It would be interesting
to find out the effect of inhibiting both Gq and Gi on the ability
of AT1AR DRY receptors to trigger the ERK pathway. With
respect to ERK activation in the nucleus, the histamine-induced EKARnuc
signal in cells expressing the H1R DRY mutant receptor achieved 60%
of the WT response. Since the spatial and temporal aspects of ERK
signaling are related to cell fate (differentiation versus proliferation),50−52 it would be interesting to find out whether the differences between
native and DRY receptor variants on the ERK response have consequences
for cell behavior. Another interesting future direction would be to
examine the signaling activity downstream of the wild-type and DRY
receptors stimulated with arrestin-biased agonists.

Several
research groups postulated the existence of a G protein-independent,
ß-arrestin-dependent ERK activation downstream of several GPCRs,
including AT1AR.9,11,14,15,17 Some of these studies employed the DRY receptor mutants to claim
G protein independence of this ERK activation. However, the residual
ability of AT1AR DRY and H1R DRY mutant receptors demonstrated
in this study challenges the notion that the DRY/AAY mutation leads
to the complete uncoupling of the receptor from G proteins. Importantly,
the stimulation of different GPCRs in the absence of G protein activation
(including “zero functional G” background) was recently
reported not to result in any ERK activation,53,54 challenging the concept of G protein-independent ERK activation.
It would be interesting to investigate whether the distinct ERK activation
observed downstream of DRY mutant activation could be reproduced by
mimicking the suboptimal and transient activation of the Gq protein, such as demonstrated in this study.

Materials and Methods
Constructs
Plasmids encoding HsH1R-mCherry and H1R-p2A-mCherry
are reported before32 and are available
from addgene (https://www.addgene.org/browse/article/22426/). The AT1AR-p2A-mCherry was reported before55 and is available from addgene (plasmid #112934). The p2A viral sequence
ensures that the mCherry is separated from the receptor protein during
translation, generating an untagged receptor and free RFP that reports
on receptor translation levels. The direct fusion, AT1AR-mCherry, was made by the restriction-enzyme-based cloning and is
available from addgene (plasmid #137782). The DRY/AAY mutation was
introduced into H1R and AT1AR sequences using site-directed
mutagenesis; after the mutations were confirmed by sequencing, H1R
DRY and AT1AR DRY sequences were cloned into pN1-mCherry
and pN1-p2A-mCherry vectors. Plasmids encoding AT1aR-AAY-mCherry,
AT1aR-AAY-p2A-mCherry, H1R-AAY-mCherry, and H1R-AAY-p2A-mCherry are
deposited at addgene (plasmids #137783, #137784, #137788, and #137787).
Plasmids encoding Rnßarr1-mYFP (plasmid #36916) and Rnßarr2-mYFP
(plasmid #36917) were obtained from addgene.org, and plasmids encoding
ßarr1-mTQ2 and ßarr2-mTQ2 were generated by cloning ß-arr1
and ß-arr2 sequences into the pN1-mTurquoise2 Clontech vector
using PCR amplification and KpnI and AgeI sites. Plasmids encoding ßarr1-mTQ2 and ßarr2-mTQ2 are
available from addgene (plasmids #137789 and #137792). Plasmids encoding
the Gq sensor (Goedhart et al. 2011) and the DORA-RhoA sensor (Unen
et al., 2015) were reported before. Plasmids encoding the endosomal

#84337) was reported as a plasma membrane marker.56 The CKAR biosensor57 was a kind
gift from Alexandra Newton (University of California, San Diego).
Cerulean-Venus versions of the EKARcyt (#18679) and EKARnuc (#18681)
biosensors39 were obtained from addgene.org.

Reagents
Histamine, angiotensin II (AngII), pyrilamine
(PY), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), pertussis toxin (PTX), and
Ro31-8425 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich/Merck. The specific Gαq
inhibitor, FR900359 (UBO-QIC), was purchased from the University of
Bonn (http://www.pharmbio.uni-bonn.de/signaltransduktion). FR900359
was added to cells (in microscopy medium) at least 10 min before the
measurements at a concentration of 1 μM. Ro31-8425 was added
to cells (in the microscopy medium) at least 25 min before the measurements
at a concentration of 10 μM. Experiments with the PTX inhibitor
were carried out using cells cultured in a serum-free Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) and incubated o/n with 100 ng/μL
PTX.

Cell Culture and Sample Preparation
HEK293TN cells
(System Biosciences, LV900A-1) and HeLA cells (American Tissue Culture
Collection: Manassas, VA) were cultured using Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplied with glutamax, 10% fetal bovine
serum, penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL) and
incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. All cell culture reagents
were obtained from Invitrogen (Bleiswijk, NL). Cells were transfected
in a 35 mm dish holding a glass coverslip (24 mm ⌀, Menzel-Gläser,
Braunschweig, Germany), using polyethylenimine (3 μL of PEI:1
μL of DNA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
For each transfection, we used 500 ng of the receptor (H1R, H1R DRY,
AT1AR, or AT1AR DRY)-carrying plasmid. Other
plasmids were transfected at 100 ng (ßarr1 fusion constructs),
150 ng (ßarr2 fusion constructs), 200 ng (Lck-mVenus, CKAR, YC3.6),
250 ng (EKARcyt, EKARnuc), 300 ng (DORA-RhoA), and 750 ng (Gq reporter, Gi1 reporter). The samples were imaged 1 day
after transfection: coverslips were mounted in an Attofluor cell chamber
(Invitrogen, Breda, NL) and submerged in 1 mL microscopy medium (20
mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid, pH = 7.4, 137
mM NaCl, 5.4 mL KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 0.8 mM MgCl2, and 20 mM glucose; Sigma-Aldrich/Merck).

Confocal and Wide-Field
Microscopy
Relocation experiments
were performed as described.58 Ratiometric
FRET measurements were performed on a previously described wide-field
microscope.38 The typical exposure time
was 100 ms, and the camera binning was set to 4 × 4. Fluorophores
were excited with a 420/30 nm light and reflected onto the sample
by a 455DCLP dichroic mirror. CFP emission was detected with a BP470/30
filter, and YFP emission was detected with a BP535/30 filter by rotating
the filter wheel. RFP was excited with a 570/10 nm light reflected
onto the sample by a 585 dichroic mirror, and RFP emission was detected
with a BP620/60 nm emission filter. All acquisitions were corrected
for the background signal and bleedthrough of CFP emission in the
YFP channel. All experiments were performed at 37 °C and in (at
least) triplicate.

Image Analysis and Data Visualization
ImageJ (National
Institute of Health) was used to analyze the raw microscopy images
and to calculate Pearson’s coefficient as a measure of colocalization.
Background subtractions, bleedthrough correction, and calculation
of the normalized ratio per time point per cell were done in Excel
(Microsoft Office). Plots were prepared with the PlotTwist59 and PlotsOfData60 web apps. Time series show the average response as a thicker line
and a ribbon for the 95% confidence interval around the mean.
