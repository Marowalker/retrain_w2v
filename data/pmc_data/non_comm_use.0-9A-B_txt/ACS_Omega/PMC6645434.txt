We
demonstrate that synthetically controlled concurrent stabilization
of Fe and O vacancy defects on the surface of interbraided nanoscale
hematite (Fe2−δO3–v) renders an interesting surface chemistry which can reduce
CO2 to CO at room temperature (RT). Importantly, we realized
a highly enhanced output of 410 μmol h–1 g–1 at RT, as compared to that of 10 μmol h–1 g–1 for bulk hematite. It is argued
based on the activity degradation under cycling and first principles
density functional theory calculations that the excess chemical energy
embedded in the defect-stabilized surface is expended in this high-energy
conversion process, which leads to progressive filling up of oxygen
vacancies.

Introduction
One of the possible
grand designs for alleviating the concentration
of atmospheric CO2 is to adsorb and chemically convert
it into useful products.1−3 The critical bottleneck still
lies in the thermodynamic stability of CO24−6 which necessitates an input of impractically high amount of energy
(CO2 → CO + 1/2O2, ΔG1000K = 190.5 kJ mol–1) or reducing
agent such as H2 for its activation.7−9 Activation essentially
involves transfer of electrons to the antibonding orbitals of CO2 and converting its linear structure to a bent anion radical
CO2δ−.10 It has been shown that alkaline earth metals and metal oxides can
effectively chemisorb CO2 by forming an anion radical on
the surface.11−13 Further, decomposition of surface CO2δ− to CO has been reported on transition metals
with low work function.14−17 Recently, Toda et al. have discussed the interesting
possibility of room-temperature (RT) dissociation of CO2 to CO.18 Also, there are a few works
on gas-phase activation and reduction of CO2 to CO on defect
oxide surfaces in dark at RT and further the enhanced increase in
CO production upon light irradiation.19,20

As the
challenge of tackling large volumes of CO2 is
intensifying, there is a growing interest to develop new materials
that can activate CO2 at lower temperatures and study the
nature of the attendant interaction. It is envisaged that such studies
may provide crucial insights into the nature of the active sites that
may be rationally developed to produce robust systems for high volume
applications. From this perspective, we demonstrate herein an interesting
case of RT activation of CO2 on the surface of dual defect-stabilized
nanoscale hematite (DSNH), which provides the sufficiently required
electron-rich sites. Importantly, we did not use any reductants such
as H2 in the studies yet realized a very impressive conversion
output of 410 μmol h–1 g–1 at RT as compared to the output of a mere 10 μmol h–1 g–1 for the bulk hematite (BH) powder in a flow
reactor. On the basis of the observation of activity decay with cycling
and first principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations,
it is argued that the excess chemical energy embedded in the dual
defect-stabilized surface is expended in this high-energy conversion
process, which leads to progressive filling up of oxygen vacancies.

Results
and Discussion
The material was synthesized by the metalloaerogel
pyrolysis method
(Scheme S1 in the Supporting Information). The porous MOF-100 aerogel after freeze-drying is seen to be transformed
into a highly mesoporous, layered, and three-dimensional (3D) interbraided-type
architecture (Figure 1a,b) upon the controlled two-step pyrolysis employed in the synthesis.
From the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Figure 1b) of our DSNH, it is evident
that the material has a uniform particle size distribution with sizes
between 18 and 25 nm.

aerogel

(b) Highly interconnected network in DSNH as seen via HRTEM and (c)
PXRD pattern comparing DSNH with BH. Inset shows the fwhm broadening
and shift in the pattern toward higher 2θ in DSNH because of
the strain induced by the defect, and (d) strain induced in DSNH and
BH was calculated using Williamson–Hall measurement.

The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
patterns (Figure 1c)
of BH and DSNH match well
with the standard pattern of hematite (JCPDS card no. 33 0664), belonging
to the R3̅c space group of
the corundum structure. As shown in the inset, the full width at half-maximum
(fwhm) of the main peak for DSNH is broader than that for BH, which
implies much smaller grain size with the possible presence of defects.
The PXRD patterns were refined using multiprofile Rietveld refinements
(Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), which showed anisotropic dilation in the cell volume of DSNH (298.24
Å3) with reference to that of BH (297.08 Å3) because of the iron vacancy (VFE), as revealed by the formula sum of Fe11.472O18.002 with an iron occupancy of 0.956 and oxygen being 1. Hence, a discrepancy
is noted in the Fe–O (1.930 Å) and O–O (2.110 Å)
bond lengths agreeing with previous studies21 (Table S1 in the Supporting Information), which implies the existence of the nonstoichiometric metastable
phase of hematite in the DSNH case. This is similar to the protohematite
phase, as reported by Gualtieri et al.22 The presence of such a defect phase also induces strain, which can
be inferred from the Williamson–Hall analysis (Figure 1d) which clearly shows the
significant difference between the strain states of DSNH and BH samples.
Because the defect-induced changes in XRD parameters are always very
small, we employed a few other key techniques to elucidate the differences
between the DSNH and BH materials further.

First, the technique
of infrared (IR) spectroscopy is employed,
and the corresponding data are shown in Figure 2a. The very strong IR bands at 460 and 544
cm–1 belong to the Fe–O stretching and bending
modes of pure hematite, respectively, and the intense 645 cm–1 feature can be ascribed to the Fe–O stretching vibration.
The key features observed at 795 and 900 cm–1 are
assigned to the out-of-plane deformational (g) modes of hydroxyls,
which can be ascribed to the Fe–O–H bending vibration.
The presence of these distinctive peaks implies that DSNH has a defect-stabilized
Fe–O– matrix, which upon atmospheric adsorption
of moisture can show the fingerprint Fe–O–H signatures.
It may be noted that these are mostly absent in the case of BH. The
next prominent mode, a broad multiline spectrum at around 1086 cm–1, can be assigned to the fingerprint region as in
α-FeOOH.23,24 Moreover, the absorption at 1385
cm–1 originates from the monodentate CO3– formation due to the adsorption of atmospheric
CO2.

Figure 2 (a) IR–vis spectra of DSNH and BH. The inset shows
the vibration
modes of 795 cm–1 of Fe–O–H out-of-plane
deformation, 900 cm–1—Fe–O–H
bending vibrations, 1086 cm–1—α-FeOOH,
and 1385 cm–1—metal coordinated CO3– modes present in DSNH, whereas these modes are
absent in BH. (b) Raman spectra reveals the defect mode present at
660 cm–1 in DSNH and not in BH. (c) Fe 2p core level
XPS spectra of DSNH and BH. The inset shows the O 2p core level spectra.
(d) UV–vis spectra of DSNH showing red shift at 560 cm–1 as compared to that of BH at 530 cm–1 and increased intensity in region III.

Raman spectra recorded to elucidate the finer features of
the microstate
of the sample and reveal the enhanced contribution at 660 cm–1 in DSNH with reference to the BH sample (Figures 2b and S2 in the Supporting Information). The second overtone of the 660 cm–1 mode, located at 1320 cm–1, is also clearly and
substantially enhanced in the DSNH case. The increased intensity in
two-phonon scattering at 1300 cm–1 can be assigned
to the second-order scattering process. A reasonable interpretation
for the enhancement of the 660 cm–1 mode, which
is a Raman forbidden LO Eu mode, is the disorder-induced symmetry
breaking caused by the metastable defect states in DSNH; notably,
this 660 cm–1 mode is inactive in BH as expected.

We also applied X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to elucidate
the differences in the nature of surface layers of DSNH and BH (Figures 2c and S3 in the Supporting Information). It is observed that
in DSNH, the Fe 2p core level line position has shifted considerably
(almost 1.1 eV) toward higher binding energy as compared with BH.
The shift toward the higher energy results from the withdrawal of
the electron density. An iron vacancy VFe, if present, would impart the neighboring oxygen with a high electron
density which in turn would further get surface hydroxylated. Thus,
the electron density on the Fe neighbors will be withdrawn, which
is reflected in the shift of the Fe 2p core level toward higher energy.

The diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) data shown in Figures 2d and S4 in the Supporting Information reveal that the absorption
maximum of the BH material is at 530 nm and that of DSNH is at 560
nm, reflecting a red shift. A typical absorption spectrum of hematite
has four absorption regions. In particular, the absorbance in region
III (600–780 nm) corresponds to the 6A1(6S) to 4T2(4G) ligand
field transition at about 640 nm. In the DSNH case, region 3 is very
prominent with increased intensity unveiling the increased ligand
field transitions; the absorption intensities of which are partially
derived from the orbital mixing between Fe3+ and O2– ions. Iron vacancies in DSNH increase the surface
charge density of oxygen ions, thereby affecting the electronic and
spin properties of Fe3+ under the influence of ligand field
provided by the oxygen ions.25 The displacement
of the equilibrium lattice geometry upon 6A1(6S) to 4T2(4G) excitation
creates coherent phonons, and the effect is pronounced in nanocrystals
as seen for the DSNH sample.

The pore size distribution and
surface area of both the DSNH and
BH samples were examined by using N2 adsorption isotherms
at 77 K (Figure 3a).
A typical type-VI reversible isotherm behavior is exhibited by DSNH,
which is the characteristic feature of mesoporous materials, whereas
the BH sample follows a typical type-II reversible isotherm behavior.
The Brunauer–Emmet–Teller surface area was found to
be 53 m2 g–1 and 12 m2 g–1 for the DSNH and BH samples, respectively. The significant
increase in the surface area clearly indicates the particle size reduction
and possibility of the presence of more active adsorptive sites on
the DSNH surface. The half pore size distribution of BH (inset of Figure 3a) was found to be
1.0–2.0 nm and that of DSNH covered a wide range between 1.0
and 9.0 nm. This very well encompasses the mesoporous region. Arguably,
DSNH should ideally show high CO2 uptake because of the
presence of reactive DSNH, and this motivated us to explore its efficacy
for CO2 adsorption. The CO2 uptake values for
BH and DSNH were found to be 3.6 cm3 g–1 and 13.6 cm3 g–1, respectively, at
273 K and 1 atm (Figure 3b). The increased CO2 uptake by DSNH can be attributed
to the presence of defect-stabilized sites in hematite that interact
effectively with CO2.

Figure 3 (a) N2 adsorption/desorption
isotherms of DSNH and BH
recorded at 77 K, and the inset shows their pore size distribution
calculated from the isotherms. (b) CO2 adsorption isotherms
at 273 K for DSNH and BH.

Further, the presence of defects was corroborated by magnetization
studies, as shown in Figure S5 in the Supporting Information. The presence of specific defects, disorder, microstructure,
and shape can influence the remanence and coercive field of this component
significantly. In our case, it can be seen that the values of remanence
(coercive field) for the BH and DSNH samples are 0.74 emu/g (924.7
Oe) and 0.83 emu/g (2821.9 Oe), respectively. The higher value of
remanence and a significantly high value of coercive field in the
case of DSNH as compared to that of BH can be attributed to the magnetocrystalline
anisotropy effect due to the peculiar interbraided shape character
of DSNH as shown by the TEM images (Figure 1b), as well as the presence of defects as
brought out by other techniques.

The transmission Mössbauer
spectra for DSNH and BH samples
are shown in Figure S6a,b in the Supprting Information, along with the fitted component(s). The corresponding
hyperfine interaction parameters (Table S2 in the Supporting Information) show a major contribution of the magnetic
sextet characteristic of hematite, as expected. However, in the DSNH
case, a tiny (1.7%) yet unmistakable contribution of a quadrupole-split
doublet (nonmagnetic contribution) is also noted. The isomer shift
(IS) of the doublet is 0.205 mm/s, which represents Fe in the Fe3+ state, but the corresponding value is lower than the characteristic
IS for the α-Fe2O3 phase (∼0.37
mm/s). Additionally, the sign of the quadrupole splitting for the
doublet is opposite to that of the base hematite phase. Such a doublet
can arise due to the presence of adsorbed moisture on the reactive
Fe–O– within the DSNH matrix and thus represents
the fingerprint region similar to ferrihydrite as discussed in the
IR section (Figure 2a). This points to the signature of a defect state in the basic matrix.
It may also be noted that the line widths of the fitted components
in the DSNH case (∼0.16 mm/s) are slightly larger than that
for the BH case. This can be due to defects and related matrix strain.

The formation of CO from CO2 on DSNH was investigated
in a stainless steel flow reactor at RT, and the results are shown
in Figure 4. Initially,
Ar was passed through the material to ensure that there are no carbon
remnants present in the same which could contribute to the CO2 reduction to CO, and no CO was recorded in the gas chromatography
(GC). Later, a fresh sample was used for further studies. At 15 min,
a maximum CO formation rate of 410 μmol h–1 g–1 was observed for DSNH, whereas BH showed a
negligible rate of 10 μmol h–1 g–1. On DSNH, the CO2 conversion at 15 min was found to be
8.1%. This remarkable increase in the formation of CO can be attributed
to the active defect sites present only in the case of our DSNH sample
surface. At 30 min, the CO conversion rate decreased to 2.8%. The
activity was found to be negligible beyond 240 min. We also studied
DSNH at 300 °C in the stream of CO2, and the initial
conversion of CO2 to CO was seen to increase significantly
by three times as compared to that at RT. Although the trend of deactivation
was similar to that at RT, it occurred at a slower rate at 300 °C.

Figure 4 Conversion
of CO2 over DSNH: (a) CO2 conversion
over DSNH and BH at RT over a period of time and (b) CO2 conversion over DSNH at 300 °C over a period of time.

We examined DSNH before and after
CO2 addition by employing
IR-vibrational spectroscopy (Figure 5) and XPS (Figure S8 in the Supporting Information). As discussed earlier (Figure 2a), the bands at 795 and 900 cm–1 in DSNH before CO2 addition are due to Fe–OH deformational
modes. A broad multiline band noted in the range of 1000–1350
cm–1 represents α-FeOOH-like atomic coordination
attributable to the defect modes. Interestingly, upon the addition
of CO2, these contributions are concomitantly and significantly
enhanced in the range of 1000–1350 cm–1 identified
with the surface oxidation of DSNH, leading to the increased concentration
of α-FeOOH. This suggests that the incoming CO2 interacts
with the active surface defects Fe–O– in
DSNH forming variety of intermediate CO2 species such as
gas-phase CO2–, chemisorbed CO3–, and Fe–CO3–. The presence of both the activated CO2– in the gas phase and the chemisorbed CO3– species was further corroborated by C 1s core level XPS spectra
(Figure S8 in the Supporting Information).

Figure 5 The IR–vis spectra were obtained for DSNH (a) before addition
of CO2 and (b) after addition of CO2.

RT activation of CO2 to CO on DSNH, which intrinsically
requires a higher energy (ΔG1000K = 190.5 kJ mol–1), is a significant discovery
reported in this work. The presence of oxide vacancies has been known
to activate CO2 at RT under dark conditions.26 In the case of DSNH, there are two important
observations that support the participation of Fe vacant sites (VFe). First, a rapid deactivation of the material
observed with the conversion almost dropping to zero within a period
of 4 h. Second, the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of
the used DSNH samples show a significant increase in the bands corresponding
to the −OH groups of oxohydroxide phases (Figure S9 in
the Supprting Information). It is plausible
that VFe defects in DSNH are capable of
chemisorbing CO2 as surface carbonate because of the increased
basicity of oxide ions (surrounding the VFe site) which spontaneously decompose to CO accompanied by the Fe–O
bond formation. Hydroxylation of Fe–O by atmospheric moisture
is traced using FT-IR (Figure S9 in the Supporting Information) for the used DSNH. More importantly, the reason
for rapid deactivation seems to be due to the progressive hydroxylation
of Fe atoms probably adjacent to VFe sites,
leaving behind the undecomposed surface CO32– blocking the active site VFe. Importantly,
heating the used deactivated DSNH to 500 °C for 3 h regained
its activity up to 60–80%.

The absence of a carbon source
before exposing the material to
CO2 environment was confirmed by the thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) profile, revealing that the product formed is solely
by CO2 passed through the material externally (Figure S11in
the Supporting Information). In the case
of DSNH, after CO2 reduction, a slow degradation pattern
is observed up to 300 °C with 5% weight loss that can be attributed
to the presence of OH groups on the material surface. Further steep
degradation at 370 °C with 8.8% weight loss of carbon present
in the system confirms that there are some stable intermediate adducts
such as CO3– on the sample surface, supporting
the FT-IR studies. The recyclability tests on DSNH at RT were conducted
for five successive cycles which reveals that the conversion ability
is retained but decreased significantly down to 3% (Figure S12 in
the Supporting Information).

We attempted
to elucidate the surface mechanisms discussed above
with the help of computer modeling studies. All DFT calculations were
carried out with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package27,28 at the generalized gradient approximation level. Ion–electron
interaction was described by the projector augmented wave29 pseudopotential with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof30 functional as the exchange–correlation
functional of the electrons. Spin polarization was applied for all
calculations. An energy cutoff of 520 eV was used for the plane-wave
basis set. The Fe2O3 (0001) surface was presented
by a layered slab. A 2 × 2 supercell along z-direction with a vacuum layer of 20 Å was used. The system
contained 120 atoms, and only the gamma-point was used for the sampling
of Brillouin zone. The structures were optimized until the maximum
force on the atoms was less than 0.005 eV/Å.

The adsorption
energy of CO2 on the pristine and defective
surfaces was calculated by the following equation  

The DFT results showed that
the Fe vacancy indeed plays an important
role in the CO2 adsorption. The adsorption of CO2 on the pristine and defective Fe2O3 surface
is in the form of the CO3– carbonate-like
structure31 (Figure 6). This CO3– carbonate configuration is in conformity with the IR spectra (the
observed frequency at 1385 cm–1). The C–O
bond length is 1.18 Å in the gas-phase CO2 molecule.
In pristine Fe2O3 surface, the C=O bond
length increases from 1.18 to 1.24 Å. However, in the case of
defect VFe Fe2O3 surface (DSNH case), the asymmetrical stretch in the C=O
bond length is 1.30 Å. Thus, because of the Fe vacancy, the C–O
bond elongation increases from 1.24 to 1.30 Å. The adsorption
energy of CO2 on the defective Fe2O3 surface is 1.62 eV. In the case on dissociation of CO2, oxygen vacancy plays a vital role,31,32 which is also
borne out in our case. The conversion of CO2 to CO is possible
if the reduced Fe2O3 surface is oxidized and
desorption of CO occurs. This process is also energetically favorable,
as shown in Figure 7.

Figure 6 CO3– carbonate-like structures formed
at (a) pristine and (b) defect VFe Fe2O3 surface. The bond lengths are given in Å
(Fe = blue, O = white, and C = yellow).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
synthesized a dual DSNH material by utilizing
the MOF-100 gel which can enable the RT activation and conversion
of CO2 to CO. Indeed, we realized a highly enhanced output
of 410 μmol h–1 g–1 at RT,
as compared to that of 10 μmol h–1 g–1 for BH. The progressive deactivation of this DSNH material is correlated
with the hydroxylation of the surface. It is argued based on the activity
degradation under cycling and first principles DFT calculations that
concurrent presence of nearby vacancies of Fe and O on the surface
is essential for this energetically unfavorable process to occur at
RT, and the excess chemical energy embedded in the defect-stabilized
surface is expended in this high-energy conversion process, which
leads to progressive filling up of oxygen vacancies.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Synthesis
All reagents and solvents used
for the synthesis and analysis were commercially available and used
as received. Bulk α-Fe2O3 was purchased
from Alfa Aesar. Iron nitrate was purchased from Merck, ethanol was
purchased from Analytical Reagents, and trimesic acid was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and was used without further purification unless
otherwise noted.

Synthesis of MOF-100
The detailed
synthetic procedure
for the synthesis of metallogel MOF-100 was followed as reported previously.33 In a typical reaction, 0.8 g (0.2 M) of trimesic
acid was dissolved in 20 mL of ethanol and 2.4 g (0.3 M) of ferric
nitrate was dissolved again in 20 mL of ethanol. The above two solutions
were mixed together under vigorous stirring at RT to form MOF-100
gel instantaneously.

Synthesis of DSNH
The above-synthesized
gel was allowed
to set overnight at RT. The so-obtained gel was freeze-dried to remove
the solvent for 2 days. The free flowing gel powder was heated under
atmospheric conditions initially at the rate of 2° min–1 up to 250 °C for 2 h, cooled down to RT, and again re-heated
in air at the rate of 2° min–1 up to 500 °C
for 3 h to obtain DSNH.

Characterization Techniques
The
PXRD analysis of the
DSNH and BH was carried out on a Philips PANalytical diffractometer
in the reflection mode using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.540
Å). The 2θ range was scanned from 10° to 80°
with a scan rate of 2.5° min–1. Surface morphological
features were examined using high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM, FEI Techai F30 with 300 kV FEG). The TEM samples
were prepared by drop-casting the sample dispersed in isopropanol
on copper grids (TED PELLA Inc, 200 mesh). The scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images were obtained with Zeiss DSM-950 SEM and FEI Quanta 200
3D SEM with a tungsten filament as an electron source operated at
10 kV. The surface oxidation states were analyzed by XPS (VG scientific
ESCA-3000 spectrometer) using non-monocromatized Mg Kα radiation
(1253 eV) at a pressure of ∼1 × 10–9 Torr. All gas adsorption experiments (up to 1 bar) were performed
on a Quantachrome QUADRASORB automatic volumetric instrument. The
molecular vibrations were confirmed by Raman spectroscopy using a
LabRAM HR800 instrument from JY Horiba. The ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) DRS were recorded using a LAMBDA-950 PerkinElmer spectrophotometer
in the wavelength range from 200 to 800 nm. FT-IR spectra were recorded
at ambient temperature on a PerkinElmer spectrum GX spectrophotometer.
The magnetism measurements were performed on a SQUID VSM magnetometer
(Quantum Design). Möossbauer analysis was performed using a
57 Co (Rh) γ-ray source and α-Fe foil as the standard
for calibration. TGA experiments were carried out in the temperature
range of 20–900 °C on a SDT Q600 TG-DTA analyzer under
air atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1.

Techniques Used for the Study of Dissociation of CO2 to
CO and Product Identification
Dissociation of CO2 was carried out in a long quartz tube reactor. Hundred milligrams
of the sample was loaded in the reactor tube. The CO2 gas
with a flow rate of 2 mL min–1 (CO2 >
99.995%) pass through the reactor. The flow rate of CO2 was controlled using an Alicat MFC instrument (MC-100SCCM-D). The
gaseous products passed through an ice-cooled trap to condense the
moisture formed in the reaction before injecting to an online gas
chromatograph (Nucon 5765 GC). The gases were analyzed with a Porapak-Q
packed column attached to the flame ionization detector (FID) methanizer
for the detection of CO, CO2, and CH4 and a
HP-PLOT Q capillary column attached to FID for the detection of hydrocarbon.
The conversion is reported as mol % determined by dividing the total
carbon mole converted as the product to the carbon mole injected as
CO2 and the selectivity as the mole fraction to the total
number of carbon moles produced as products.
