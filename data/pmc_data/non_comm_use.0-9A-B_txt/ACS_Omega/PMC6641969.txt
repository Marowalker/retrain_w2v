==== Body
In the above-mentioned article (DOI:
10.1021/acsomega.7b01323), Figures 5(A) and (B) on
page 834 have been corrected for wrong images and have been replaced
by the figure below. Accordingly the text in the Results and Discussion should be
read as follows: The average diameter of CD should be read as 2.8
nm instead of 3.28 nm (page number 835, under the section “2.3.
TEM and SAED Analysis”) given in the original text. Similarly,
HRTEM on page number 835, under the section “2.3. TEM and SAED
Analysis” and high-resolution transmission electron microscopic
(HRTEM) on page number 834 (Figure 5, legend) should be read as TEM. Figure 5(C) remains the same.
The changes do not affect the results otherwise, and the authors deeply
regret the error.
