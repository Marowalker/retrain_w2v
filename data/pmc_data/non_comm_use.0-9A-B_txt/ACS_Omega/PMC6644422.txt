Ethylene
diamine-based porous organic polymer (EPOP) was synthesized,
carbonized at different temperatures, and characterized. The successful
formation of the triazine polymer was confirmed by Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy, 13C, and 15N cross-polarization
magic angle spinning solid-state NMR. The two-dimensional layered
architecture and graphitic nature of the samples resembled that of
nitrogen-doped amorphous carbon, as confirmed by Raman, powder X-ray
diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy measurements. The
catalytic activity of these materials toward nitrophenol reduction
and electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER)
were systematically evaluated in detail. Electrocatalytic activity
toward oxygen evolution reaction was systematically evaluated by chronoamperometry
and linear sweep voltammetry. Results clearly demonstrate that all
of these catalysts exhibit good OER activity and excellent stability.
Among all catalysts, EPOP-700 showed better OER activity, as reflected
by its onset potential and current density, comparable with that of
the metal-based OER catalysts and better than that of metal-free catalysts.
Further, their catalytic activity toward the reduction of 4-nitrophenol
to 4-aminophenol was tested with NaBH4; although all of
these catalysts showed good catalytic activity; EPOP-800 displayed
better catalytic activity.

Introduction
Porous
organic polymers (POPs), a subclass of organic polymers/organic
materials, show great advantage over conventional polymers in the
area of catalysis due to their high surface area.1,2 They
are highly cross-linked and are amorphous in nature.1,3 Proper tuning of the porosity in these materials can be achieved
with desired functional groups or linking units. It is anticipated
that porous organic polymers with high nitrogen content are desirable
for catalytic applications.4 It is also
advantageous that the “N” atom can coordinate to metal
atoms;5 hence, their surface can be modified
with desired metals to further improve their catalytic properties.6 Among the porous organic polymers, covalent triazine
frameworks constitute an important class because of their high nitrogen
content, high surface area, high thermal and chemical stability, easy
preparation on a large scale, and use in catalytic applications.6−9 Thomas and co-workers developed a novel ionothermal process for
the synthesis of covalent triazine frameworks from aromatic nitriles
using ZnCl2 at elevated temperatures (≥400 °C)
in molten state.10 Such a high-temperature
procedure usually yields highly porous framework due to the partial
decomposition of organic moiety, although it was reported that nitrile
trimers are stable up to 400 °C.6,10,11 POPs can also be synthesized from melamine3 and cyanuric chloride (C-Cl) under mild conditions;8,12,13 however, POPs prepared under
mild conditions exhibit very low surface area.14,15 It is further shown that these syntheses are solvent dependent.
The condensation reaction in dimethylacetamide and N-methyl pyrrolidine yielded 4 times high surface area material than
the one obtained using dioxane as a solvent, indicating the impact
of solvent on porosity in such reactions. Fifteen POPs are electron
rich and they exhibit good π-electron mobility along the triazine
ring and if conjugated with an aromatic linker, they exhibit good
electronic conductivity, which enhances their chemical, electrochemical,
and photocatalytic activity.16 Altogether,
POPs find application in energy storage devices, gas storage/separation,
photocatalysis, etc. wherein the triazine nitrogen is shown to play
a dominant role.16−21 Recent applications of POPs focus on the heteroatom doping, multilayer
assembling, and metal cocatalysts aimed toward further enhancement
of their catalytic properties.22−25

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the
most promising sustainable
systems to generate clean and effective energy. OER is a complex multistep
reaction as it involves several surface-adsorbed intermediates, and
this reaction usually requires large overpotential for the actual
process, which distinctly reduces the process efficiency even if the
benchmark catalysts are applied.26 Numerous
electrocatalysts have been developed till date to improve the efficiency
of oxygen evolution.27 Ru- and Ir-based
noble metal catalysts were frequently employed as benchmark catalysts
due to their efficiency in oxygen evolution reaction. Further, nanoscale
catalysts with reduced noble metal content and high surface area were
developed to reduce the cost. Later, metal nanocatalysts on carbon
matrices were developed. In this scenario, metal-free catalysts have
attracted wide attention owing to their analogous performance with
noble metal catalysts. Frequently studied metal-free catalysts include
graphene-based materials, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and so on, which
are usually expensive. Metal-free catalysts were also developed from
inexpensive carbon-based materials by high-temperature treatment under
inert conditions.

On the other hand, 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) is
an important organic
pollutant obtained from agricultural and industrial sources.28 Metal-catalyzed reduction of 4-NP with excess
NaBH4 yields 4-aminophenol (4-AP), a key intermediate in
the production of paracetamol and dyeing industry. Hence, development
of an efficient catalyst for the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP will be
of broad interest owing to its industrial value. In general, metal
or metal-based nanocatalysts were employed for the catalytic reduction
of 4-NP to 4-AP with excess NaBH4. Till date, very few
metal-free catalysts based on graphene materials are known for the
reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP, which are usually expensive.28,29 In this context, development of a catalyst with dual performance
in OER and nitrophenol reduction would be interesting, provided they
display excellent catalytic activities in both the reactions, as they
follow a different pathway.

Recently, we reported on the synthesis
of phenylenediamine-based
POP network and its electrocatalytic activity toward the nitrobenzene
reduction and oxygen evolution reaction (OER).14 Further, the carbonized sample was tested for its energy
storage performance.30 There are very few
reports available on OER and nitrophenol reduction using metal-free
catalysts derived from POPs.

Herein, we report the synthesis,
carbonization, and characterization
of ethylene diamine-based porous organic polymer (EPOP) and their
catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction and nitrophenol
reduction.

Results and Discussion
The reported procedure was followed
to obtain EPOP (Scheme 1).14 EPOP-600, EPOP-700, and EPOP-800
were obtained by the carbonization
of EPOP sample at 600, 700, and 800 °C under inert atmosphere
(3 h) in a tubular furnace, respectively.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of EPOP
and Its Carbon Composites
The successful formation of the porous organic polymer
is confirmed
by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis. The absence
of cyanuric chloride (C-Cl) stretching vibration at 850 cm–1 and a broad peak at 3400 cm–1 corresponding to
“NH2” of ethylene diamine confirms the absence
of both the starting materials (Figure S1). Apart from this, key peaks such as the stretching frequencies
of triazine rings were observed at 1347 and 1571 cm–1, bending and stretching vibration of sp3 “CH2” moiety were observed at 1447 and 2940 cm–1 respectively. The peak at 804 cm–1 corresponds
to the breathing mode of vibration of triazine unit (Figure S2). All of these characteristic peaks indicate the
successful formation of triazine polymer, which is further confirmed
by solid-state 13C and 15N cross-polarization
magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) spectroscopy. The FT-IR of the carbonized
sample (EPOP-800) showed key features of the triazine ring to some
extent; however, the characteristic peaks corresponding to CH2 group were absent and the pattern looked very similar to
that of the nitrogen-doped graphene.31

The successful formation and the nature of the formed porous organic
polymers can be confirmed by cross-polarization magic angle spinning
(CP-MAS) solid-state 13C and 15N NMR spectroscopy. 13C CP-MAS measurement of EPOP sample (Figure S3a) confirmed the coexistence of triazine and ethylene
diamine moieties in the polymer; the aromatic sp2 carbon
of triazine was observed at δ 166 ppm, and the aliphatic sp3 carbon of ethylene diamine was observed at δ 41 ppm,
indicating that these two individual moieties are covalently linked
during the synthesis [starting materials are soluble in organic solvents;
upon completion of the reaction, the product EPOP was washed several
times with organic solvents to remove unreacted starting materials].
Similarly, 15N CP-MAS measurement of EPOP sample (Figure S3b) showed two broad peaks at δ
−172 and −90 ppm, corresponding to the triazine N and
linker ethylene diamine N, respectively. This confirms the presence
of two different N (triazine N and ethylene diamine N) atoms in the
sample.

Raman spectroscopy is an important tool that specifies
the defects
and disorderly nature of carbon materials. Figure 1 shows the Raman spectra of carbon composites
of EPOP, and the Raman spectra of EPOP is given in Figure S4a. It is clear that after carbonization at different
temperatures, we observe only two peaks at 1330 (D-band) and 1600
cm–1 (G-band). This clearly proves that EPOP has
undergone chemical and structural changes. The observed peaks lie
in the D- and G-band region; usually, D-band arises due to the disorders
and imperfection present in the carbon lattice. G-band is assigned
to one of the two E2g modes corresponding to stretching
vibrations in the basal-plane (sp2 domains) of carbon lattice.
The D- and G-band peaks were observed at 1346, 1358, and 1342 cm–1 and 1542, 1550, and 1567 cm–1,
EPOP-600, 700, 800 respectively. The G peaks of all samples shift
to higher frequencies as the pyrolyzing temperature increased. The
quantitative amount of blueshift for EPOP-700 and EPOP-800 is 8 and
25 cm–1, respectively, when compared to that of
EPOP-600. It is obvious that the shift in Raman peaks may be attributed
to the effect of doping and strain. Usually, the doping of nitrogen
in carbon-based materials, such as graphene and CNTs, the blueshift
of G peak is apparent, which we observed in our case. Typically, it
is known that the compressive/tensile strain in carbon materials (graphene
and CNTs) may induce a blue/redshift of Raman peaks. Doping of nitrogen
atoms in carbon lattice may lead to the defect pinning and distortion
of lattice. The doping may be associated with bond formation and this
produces deformation and stress fields. The formation of pyrrolic
nitrogen by doping of nitrogen will have a C–N bond length
of 1.37 Å, which shortens compared to that of C–C bond
(1.42 Å). The extent of structural disorder present in the carbonized
POP can be considered from the ID/IG ratio.32 The ID/IG ratios of all
three carbonized samples were found to be 1.47 (EPOP-600), 1.41 (EPOP-700),
and 0.87 (EPOP-800). The increase in ID/IG ratio indicates more structural disorder;
if the value is high, it indicates a low degree of graphitization.
The order of graphitization for all three carbonized samples can be
given as EPOP-800 > EPOP-700 > EPOP-600.

Figure 1 Raman spectrum of carbon
composites of EPOP.

Figure 2a–d
shows the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of EPOP and its
carbon composites. All samples displayed a broad peak, and hence deduction
of any structural information of the POP becomes feeble. EPOP showed
a broad peak around the 2θ value of 23.7°, ascribed to
the graphitic carbon like structure, with a d-spacing
of 3.72 Å,32 whereas EPOP-600 and
EPOP-800 showed a broad peak with a spacing of 3.68 and 3.59 Å,
respectively, suggesting the presence of graphitic structure.32,33 EPOP-700 showed a broad peak around the 2θ value of 26.1°
close to that of graphitic carbon with d-spacing
of 3.47 Å.33 From the PXRD, we infer
that all samples were found to resemble graphitic carbon. The reason
for the resemblance to graphitic carbon could be attributed to the
carbonization process; a similar kind of observation was made for
room-temperature analogues.6 Further, these
results were supported by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis.

TEM image of the EPOP showed stacked sheetlike
network, whereas
the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images
of the carbonized samples EPOP-600 and EPOP-700 showed exfoliated
sheetlike structure. EPOP-800 displayed carbon sheetlike morphology,
which was crumpled to spherelike morphology on the topographical view34 (Figure 3). Selected area electron diffraction patterns of all of
these samples showed amorphous nature of the material (Figures S5–S8). These results are highly
consistent with XRD analyses.

EPOP-600, (c) EPOP-700,
and (d) EPOP-800.

Field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of
EPOP and the carbonized samples were shown in Figures S9–S12. EPOP sample exhibited irregularly agglomerated
particle-like morphology. In the case of carbonized samples, change
in morphology was observed. As the carbonization temperature increased
from 600 to 800 °C, the morphology changed from irregularly agglomerated
network to highly agglomerated network, which could be attributed
to the high pyrolysis temperature.4

The oxygen evolution activities of the prepared carbon sample (EPOP,
EPOP-600, EPOP-700, and EPOP-800) were studied in 1 M KOH using linear
sweep voltammetry (LSV). The prepared samples were coated on carbon
paper and used as working electrode. Figure 4 shows the polarization curves of the prepared
carbon sample. Among these samples, EPOP-700 showed an onset potential
of 1.527 V, which is lower than that of the other carbon samples (EPOP:
1.673 V, EPOP-600: 1.70 V, EPOP-800: 1.65 V). EPOP-700 sample exhibited
overpotential of 297 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA/cm2; however, other carbon samples showed relatively high overpotential,
as shown in Table 1. Also, at high current density of 300 mA/cm2, the EPOP-700
sample showed a low overpotential of 580 mV, whereas other samples
exhibited high overpotential. The obtained results with high current
density are found to be better than the metal-based OER catalysts.35 The influence of pH on the OER activity has
been studied for EPOP-700 sample (Figure S21). Among the four catalysts used in this study, EPOP-700 showed high
electrocatalytic activity, which could be ascribed to the presence
of nitrogen atoms present on the surface/edges of the sample. It is
evident from the elemental
analysis that the N content in the sample EPOP-700 has relatively
high nitrogen content than other samples as a result of high nitrogen
atom doping during carbonization process (Supporting Information (SI), Table 1). From N %, it may
possibly be concluded that 700 °C is the ideal temperature to
attain high nitrogen doping with respect to EPOP samples. The presence
of nitrogen atoms on the surface impacts the polarity and hydrophilicity
of the sample, which is known to improve mass transfer properties
at the electrode–electrolyte interface. The OER kinetics of
the samples EPOP, EPOP-600, EPOP-700, and EPOP-800 were examined using
a Tafel plot. From figure 4b, it is apparent that favorable reaction kinetics and a small
Tafel slope of 76 mV/dec was found for EPOP-700 among all studied
catalysts (SI, Table 2). The Tafel slope
value implies that a lower electrochemical polarization occurred at
the interface. The enhanced OER activity of EPOP-700 sample can be
explained on the basis of N % (SI, Table 1). A high N % of 16.87 was obtained for EPOP-700 in comparison to
other samples. The morphology analysis of EPOP-700 reveals the high
stability of the carbon after prolonged OER for 10 h (Figure S19). EPOP-700 sample displayed better
electrocatalytic performance among the studied catalysts (EPOP, EPOP-600,
and EPOP-800), and this improved performance might be related to the
increased electron transfer at the electrode interface accompanied
by high ionic conductivity. To elucidate this, electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) measurements for all four catalysts were carried
out (Figure S17). Nyquist plots obtained
from the EIS measurement showed a lower resistance of 90 Ω for
EPOP-700 compared to that of other catalysts (EPOP = 293 Ω,
EPOP-600 = 238 Ω, EPOP-800 = 102 Ω). This lower charge-transfer
resistance arises from the efficient interfacial contact of porous
carbon network with electrolyte. EPOP-700 catalyst holds a smaller Rct, which facilitates the faster charge-transfer
rate and hence better OER performance. Also, we anticipate that such
OER performance might be concomitantly related to the intrinsic activity
of the catalyst, high electrochemical surface area (ECSA), and efficient
charge-transfer kinetics prevailing at the electrode surface. The
mechanistic aspect of the EPOP-700 can be explained as follows: the
nitrogen atom present in the network of EPOP-700 might be negatively
charged because of the electron withdrawing nature, and hence the
adjacent carbon atoms might become positively charged (Figure S20). The positively charged carbon adsorbs
OH– from the electrolyte, which leads to the accumulation
of OH– on the surface of the catalyst, and this
may have positive influence on the catalytic reaction. For the rate-determining
step of OER, the adjacent positively charged carbon atoms should undergo
facile recombination of the two adsorbed species. The electron density
localized on the nitrogen atoms in the carbon network may reside near
the Fermi level, and so they can participate in the electrocatalytic
reaction.36

To evaluate the catalytic performance of EPOP and
its carbon composites
toward the reduction of nitro group to amino group, the catalytic
reduction of 4-NP was carried out in excess NaBH4 in aqueous
medium. The decrease and increase in absorption intensity of 4-NP
or 4-AP is measured in the presence of different catalysts as a function
of time, as shown in Figure 5a–d. As the time increases, absorbance at 400 nm corresponding
to 4-nitrophenolate anion decreases and the absorbance at 298 nm corresponding
to 4-aminophenolate anion increases, indicating the catalytic activity
of all four catalysts. An identical experiment was carried out with
excess NaBH4 without catalyst. It is remarkable that even
after a day, no change in intensity of 4-nitrophenolate peak was observed,
indicating that the catalyst is necessary for this conversion. The
difference in the degree of catalytic activity can be correlated with
the complete disappearance of the peak at 400 nm vs function of time.
Although all catalysts displayed good catalytic activity toward the
reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP, the time taken for the complete reduction
of 4-NP to 4-AP varied. It is evident that EPOP-800 sample took 35
min for the complete conversion of 4-NP to 4-AP, displaying the best
catalytic activity among all. The order of catalytic activity can
be derived as EPOP-800 > EPOP-700 > EPOP-600 > EPOP. From
these observations,
it can be concluded that the catalyst with a high degree of graphitization
showed better catalytic activity in 4-NP reduction, whereas the same
is not in the case of OER catalysis that follows a different mechanism.
The reaction followed pseudo first-order kinetics. The improved catalytic
performance of EPOP-800 can be ascribed to the facile adsorption of
4-NP on the catalyst’s surface. The concept of facile adsorption
of 4-NP on the carbon surface has been reported using density functional
theory calculation in the literature.37 The rate constant for 4-NP reduction of all catalysts was tabulated
(SI, Table 3), and the activity factors
for all catalysts were found to be 63.3, 90, 113, 150 min–1/g, respectively. The observed rate constant and activity factor
values are better than those of the reported nonmetallic catalysts.29,37

Conclusions
In conclusion, porous organic polymers based
on ethylene diamine
and triazine were successfully synthesized, carbonized at different
temperatures, and characterized. The as-synthesized materials were
studied for the catalytic activity toward OER and nitrophenol reduction.
Among the catalysts employed in this study, EPOP-700 sample displayed
excellent OER activity with an overpotential of 580 mV at a current
density of 300 mA/cm2, with a prolonged stability over
10 h. These results were further complimented by Tafel slope and EIS
measurements. A small Tafel slope of 76 mV/dec and lower resistance
of 90 Ω were obtained for EPOP-700 compared to that of other
catalysts employed in this study. The excellent activity of EPOP-700
could be attributed to high N doping, as apparent from elemental analysis.
The obtained results were found to be better than those of the metal-free
catalysts and are comparable with those of metal-based OER catalysts.
In addition, these catalysts showed excellent catalytic activity toward
the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP. EPOP-800 sample displayed excellent
catalytic activity by reducing 4-NP to 4-AP in 35 min, whereas other
catalysts took relatively longer times. The observed rate constant
and activity factor values are better than those of the reported nonmetallic
catalysts.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
All reagents
and solvents were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich/Alfa Aesar and used without further purification.

13C and 15N CP-MAS measurements were carried
out on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer, operating at 100.6 MHz for 13C and 40.53 MHz for 15N using a Bruker 4 mm double
resonance probe-head at a spinning rate of 10 kHz. The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns were measured at room temperature (RT) using a Bruker
D8 ADVANCE instrument using Cu Kα radiation with a wavelength
of 1.5418 Å. The powder diffraction covered the angle ranges
from 5–65°, with a step angle of 0.02°/min. The morphological
structures of the prepared samples were captured using a scanning
electron microscope (SEM) of TESCAN, VEGA 3 with Bruker detector.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to study the thermal degradation
of synthesized materials using a TGA/SDT Q600, TA instruments at a
scanning rate of 5 °C/min, from room temperature to 1000 °C
under nitrogen atmosphere. FT-IR analysis was carried out on a Bruker
Tensor 27 (Optik GmbH) using RT DLaTGS (Varian) detector. Transmission
electron microscope (Tecnai 20 G2 (FEI make), Netherlands) was used
to analyze the surface morphology. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface area and porosity analysis was carried out on an Accelerated
Surface Area and Porosimetry system (ASAP-2020 V4.03 (V4.03 H)) at
77 K. Raman spectra were recorded using a high-resolution Renishaw
Raman microscope employing a He–Ne laser of 18 mW at 633 nm.

Cyclic voltammetry was carried on an autolab PGSTAT 302N workstation
at room temperature in a standard three-electrode cell. The working
electrode was a carbon paper (area = 1 cm2, mass loading
of 2 mg/cm2) and modified glassy carbon, and the counter
electrode was a Pt wire. The reference electrode was Ag/AgCl/KCl (3
M) electrode. The oxygen evolution reaction was studied by using linear
sweep voltammetry carried out at room temperature using 1 M KOH as
the electrolyte at a scan rate of 1 mV/s. For the ease of comparison
of results, the potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen
electrode scale.

Ink Preparation
The ink was prepared
by equimolar preparation
1:1:1 (water/isopropyl alcohol/Nafion), and the solution was sonicated
for 3 h. A small volume (100 μL) of this solution was added
to 5 mg of the catalyst to prepare the slurry and was sonicated for
30 min. The catalyst ink was coated on the surface of tory carbon
by manual brush coating. The modified tory carbon was allowed to dry
at room temperature.

Nitrophenol Reduction
Reduction
of 4-NP to 4-AP was
carried out in the presence of excess NaBH4, which is an
important organic catalytic reaction. This reaction was carried out
to evaluate the catalytic performance of EPOP catalyst. Two milligrams
of 4-NP was dissolved in 40 mL of deionized water and sonicated for
half an hour; the solution was light yellow. Then, NaBH4 (120 mg) was added to the 4-NP solution. In the absence of EPOP
catalysts, a small amount of bubbles was observed because of the hydrogen
generation by the reduction reaction between NaBH4 and
water. However, in the presence of EPOP (3 mg) catalysts, a large
amount of bubbles was observed and the gas release rate became much
faster.

Synthesis of EPOP
Under inert conditions, ethylene
diamine (1.4 g, 24.4 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous 1,4-dioxane
(100 mL) under constant stirring at RT. To this solution, K2CO3 (4.5 g, 32.5 mmol) was added and stirred for 30 min.
Then, the solution was cooled to 10 °C and cyanuric chloride
(3 g, 16.27 mmol) dissolved in 100 mL anhydrous 1,4-dioxane was added
dropwise over 8 h. The mixture was allowed to warm to RT and refluxed
for 3 days (during the course of the reaction, color changed from
dark brown to pale brown). The solution was cooled to RT; the mixture
was filtered, washed with 1,4-dioxane and methanol to remove unreacted
SM, and dried under vacuum to yield EPOP (yield = 90%).
