Conducting
polymer scaffolds can promote cell growth by electrical
stimulation, which is advantageous for some specific type of cells
such as neurons, muscle, or cardiac cells. As an additional feature,
the measure of their impedance has been demonstrated as a tool to
monitor cell growth within the scaffold. In this work, we present
innovative conducting polymer porous scaffolds based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
(PEDOT):xanthan gum instead of the well-known PEDOT:polystyrene sulfonate
scaffolds. These novel scaffolds combine the conductivity of PEDOT
and the mechanical support and biocompatibility provided by a polysaccharide,
xanthan gum. For this purpose, first, the oxidative chemical polymerization
of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene was carried out in the presence of polysaccharides
leading to stable PEDOT:xanthan gum aqueous dispersions. Then, by
a simple freeze-drying process, porous scaffolds were prepared from
these dispersions. Our results indicated that the porosity of the
scaffolds and mechanical properties are tuned by the solid content
and formulation of the initial PEDOT:polysaccharide dispersion. Scaffolds
showed interconnected pore structure with tunable sizes ranging between
10 and 150 μm and Young’s moduli between 10 and 45 kPa.
These scaffolds successfully support three-dimensional cell cultures
of MDCK II eGFP and MDCK II LifeAct epithelial cells, achieving good
cell attachment with very high degree of pore coverage. Interestingly,
by measuring the impedance of the synthesized PEDOT scaffolds, the
growth of the cells could be monitored.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Three-dimensional
(3D) cell culture in artificial environments
finds numerous applications. It is currently used for cancer research,
drug discovery, and regenerative medicine among many other research
areas. To culture cells in vitro, 3D structures that support cell
attachment and guide cells for tissue development are needed.1 These structures are normally made of polymeric
materials, that is, polymers which allow designing scaffolds with
certain structural and mechanical properties.2 Among these scaffold properties, their porosity and stiffness are
of crucial importance. Their void structure is a key factor as interconnected
pores create pore networks, which aid diffusion of nutrients and oxygen
and removal of waste,3 and facilitate scaffold
colonization.4 The mechanical behavior
of the scaffold should mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM),2 providing an environment as similar as possible
to the cell natural environment.

As a particular type of scaffold,
conducting polymer scaffolds
are currently interesting for their additional advantage of promoting
cell growth by electrical stimulation. Conducting polymers used in
tissue engineering are polypyrrole,5,6 polyaniline,7,8 polythiophenes,9,10 and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
(PEDOT).11−13 They have been used to enhance bone, muscle, and
nerve tissue regeneration.6 Moreover, they
are also used in drug delivery, with drugs bound in the scaffolds
and released through an electrical signal.14 Conducting scaffolds can be synthesized by many techniques and,
in particular, PEDOT scaffolds have been prepared15 by chemical, vapor-phase polymerization16 of and by electrochemical polymerization17,18 of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) monomer around a previously
synthesized scaffold. Another alternative is to use the freeze-drying
method to fabricate porous PEDOT:polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) 3D scaffolds.19,20 This method allows adding different additives to improve mechanical
robustness and stability of the scaffold or even proteins such as
collagen to improve cell growth prior to the freeze-drying step. As
a new application recently, a live-cell monitoring platform was demonstrated
by using a conducting polymer scaffold based on PEDOT.20 The inclusion of cells within the porous scaffold
affects the impedance of the electrically conducting polymer network,
and thus, it can be used as an in situ tool to monitor the cell growth.

For their successful interaction with cells, the polymeric scaffolds
should act as an artificial ECM. ECM in the human body is composed
of proteins and polysaccharides.21 For
this reason, it is ideal that these biopolymers are used in the scaffold
design.22,23 In fact, polysaccharides form hydrogels
in water, reducing the stiffness of the scaffolds to values similar
to that in biological tissues. Among the employed polysaccharides,
xanthan gum presents special interest because of its processability
and biocompatibility.24,25 For instance, xanthan gum scaffolds
have been used to improve osteoblast growth26 and fibroblast proliferation.5 We present
in this work a new synthetic route to elaborate conducting PEDOT:xanthan
gum scaffolds that can be used for cell growth monitoring. As a result
of the polysaccharide content, these scaffolds better mimic the ECM
than PEDOT:PSS scaffolds. The scaffold preparation consists of two
steps. First, an aqueous dispersion of PEDOT:polysaccharide is synthesized
by oxidative polymerization of EDOT in the presence of xanthan gum
as the stabilizer. Second, a conductive porous scaffold is obtained
by freeze-drying the PEDOT:xanthan gum dispersions. As an application,
the conducting 3D scaffolds were used for hosting and monitoring the
growth of MDCK cells.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization of PEDOT:Xanthan
Gum Aqueous Dispersions
Recently, the synthetic route toward
PEDOT:polysaccharide dispersions has been reported and these materials
combine the conductivity of PEDOT and the biocompatibility of polysaccharides
such as dextran sulfate,27 sialic acid,28 pectin,29 hyaluronic
acid,30 chondroitin sulfate,31 or guar gum.32 In
this work, a similar method was applied to synthesize PEDOT:xanthan
gum aqueous dispersions. The polymerization reaction can be found
in Figure 1. EDOT monomer
was polymerized in the presence of the polysaccharide xanthan gum
by oxidative polymerization in water at room temperature using ammonium
persulfate ((NH4)2S2O8) as an oxidant in the presence of iron(III) sulfate (Fe2(SO4)3) as the catalyst. As the polymerization
of EDOT is taking place, the dispersion first turns more yellowish
(from 2 to 8 h, 0.2 monomer conversion) to more grayish at 12–24
h (0.4 monomer conversion) to then acquire the bright blue color characteristic
of PEDOT chains, which starts to be visible after 48 h of reaction
time. The reaction takes place slowly and the initial very viscous
solution becomes less viscous, which was also observed in previous
PEDOT:polysaccharide systems, and it is associated with the breaking
of the strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding of the polysaccharides
by the PEDOT chains. The monomer consumption was followed by high-pressure
liquid chromatography (HPLC), confirming that the full conversion
was reached after 7 days.

Figure 1 PEDOT:xanthan gum synthetic scheme and pictures
of the reaction
flask at different times.

The chemical oxidation polymerization method to obtain PEDOT:polysaccharide
aqueous dispersions is very versatile, allowing the preparation of
PEDOT:xanthan gum in different ratios. Thus, we synthesized four different
dispersions with the PEDOT:xanthan gum wt ratios 0.25:0.75, 0.33:0.67,
0.5:0.5, and 0.67:0.33. These dispersions were characterized by UV–vis–NIR
spectroscopy as shown in Figure 2a. In the four dispersions studied, two characteristic
PEDOT absorption bands are observed. The broad absorption band of
PEDOT π–π* centered at ∼800 nm33 and a bipolaron band at higher wavelengths centered
at 1200 nm. These two absorption bands indicate the presence of doped
PEDOT chains as cation and dication forms34 and they are related to the conductivity of the material, confirming
the conducting nature of the PEDOT chains in these PEDOT:xanthan gum
dispersions. Although the absorbance of both bands is visible in the
four dispersions studied, it is higher in the case of PEDOT:xanthan
gum (0.5:0.5). This indicates the higher presence of doped chains
in this PEDOT dispersion, which is a sign of high conductivity.

gum dispersion characterization. (a) UV spectra of
PEDOT:xanthan gum dispersions at different ratios and (b) representative
SEM picture of a drop-casted PEDOT:xanthan gum dispersion (0.5:0.5).

PEDOT:xanthan gum films can be
easily prepared by casting these
dispersions. One typical picture of these drop-casted films is shown
in Figure 2b. As observed
in other PEDOT:polysaccharide systems,31,32 the dispersions
are formed by spherical PEDOT particles covered by xanthan gum of
sizes ranging between 100 and 200 nm. PEDOT spherical particles are
formed as a result of PEDOT chains being surrounded by the stabilizer.
When the dispersions are drop-casted, the spherical particles agglomerate
together in the form of a film as shown in the scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) image. This allows the intimate mixing of both PEDOT and xanthan
gum. The electrical conductivity of the films of PEDOT:xanthan gum
(0.5:0.5, 0.67:0.33) was also characterized by a four-point probe
showing values of 10–2 S cm–1.

2.2 Preparation and Characterization of PEDOT:Xanthan
Gum Scaffolds by the Freeze-Drying Method
In the second step,
porous PEDOT:xanthan gum scaffolds were prepared by freeze-drying
technique as illustrated in Figure 3. In our case, we used divinyl sulfone (DVS) as an
additive to keep the integrity of the scaffolds. The choice of DVS
is due to recent studies,35,36 where DVS has proven
to be an effective cross-linker for PEDOT films, showing excellent
biocompatibility and neuroregeneration as compared to the conventional
cross-linkers. It is well known that different parameters such as
the polymer concentration of the initial dispersion, the freeze-drying
conditions, or the PEDOT:xanthan gum ratio may affect the morphology
of the scaffold.

Figure 3 Illustration of the preparation of PEDOT:xanthan gum scaffolds.

To study the effect of the polymer
concentration, PEDOT:xanthan
gum (0.5:0.5) dispersions were prepared at three different solid contents
(1, 2, and 3 wt % in water). After the freeze-drying step, SEM images
of these different scaffolds were taken (Figure 4). In Figure 4a, the 1 wt % scaffold shows a porous structure based
on a network of fibers. In Figure 4b, the 2% solid content scaffold shows pores with high
polydispersity and pore size around ø 50–150
μm. In Figure 4c, the 3% solid content scaffold shows smaller pores with less polydispersity
and pore size around ø 10–30 μm.
This experiment illustrates how the porosity of these scaffolds can
be varied, which is an advantage of the freeze-drying method. According
to the type of cell that will be studied, the porosity can be selected
by varying the initial solid content of the synthesized PEDOT:xanthan
gum dispersion.37 The highly interconnected
porous structure of the scaffolds is also clearly visible in these
SEM images. This represents a second advantage of this method, as
the interconnection of pores facilitates mass transport and cell migration
within the scaffold.

PEDOT:xanthan gum (0.5:0.5) 1% solid content, (b) PEDOT:xanthan gum
(0.5:0.5) 2% solid content, and (c) PEDOT:xanthan gum (0.5:0.5) 3%
solid content.

Second, the effect of
the PEDOT:xanthan gum ratio on the structure
and mechanical properties of the scaffold was investigated. In this
case, the PEDOT scaffolds from aqueous dispersion having 2 wt % solid
content were chosen because of the intermediate pore size (50–150
μm ø) of the generated scaffolds, a pore
size that facilitates cell nutrient percolation, cell attachment,
and colonization.38,39Figure 5 shows the SEM images of PEDOT:xanthan gum
scaffolds obtained at different ratios (0.25:0.75, 0.33:0.67, 0.5:0.5,
and 0.67:0.33). By comparing the SEM pictures, it is observed that
at high content of PEDOT (Figure 5a), scaffolds with small pores and thick walls connecting
these pores are obtained. On the other hand, at high xanthan gum content
(Figure 5d), the scaffold
shows the biggest pores and the highest porosity.

gum scaffolds at different PEDOT:xanthan
gum weight ratios. (a) PEDOT:xanthan gum (0.67:0.33), (b) PEDOT:xanthan
gum (0.5:0.5), (c) PEDOT:xanthan gum (0.33:0.67), and (d) PEDOT:xanthan
gum (0.25:0.75).

Significant differences
among scaffolds were observed by studying
the mechanical properties of the scaffolds by compression test. The
compression test was performed both on dry and wet scaffolds after
8 h in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer showing values between
1 and 100 kPa (Figure 6). As a general trend, the higher the PEDOT content, the higher the
Young’s modulus of the scaffolds. This is somehow expected
because xanthan gum is a soft polymer making the scaffold more flexible
overall. On the contrary, PEDOT chains are stiff, and the higher the
content of PEDOT in the scaffold, the higher the Young’s modulus
of the scaffold. Once the scaffolds are in PBS solution, the scaffolds
hydrate and swell, becoming soft but keeping their overall structure.
We observed a reduction in the Young’s moduli in all cases
to approximately half the value than those in dry conditions. It is
worth to note that similar values were reported for PEDOT:PSS scaffolds
(73 kPa dry and 42 kPa in PBS).40 The Young’s
modulus values of these scaffolds are all <100 kPa, which corresponds
with the values of our body tissues, where Young’s modulus
is in the range 1–100 kPa depending on the tissue.41 The polysaccharide content of these scaffolds
helps to reduce the mismatch of rigidity between a synthetic scaffold
and the ECM. In conclusion, this is another way in which we can show
that this synthetic way to obtain PEDOT scaffolds is very versatile
as not only porosity but also the stiffness of the scaffolds can be
varied by varying the initial content of PEDOT and polysaccharide.

modulus of PEDOT:xanthan gum scaffolds measured
in dry and in PBS solution at different ratios (0.25:0.75) black,
(0.33:0.67) red, (0.5:0.5) blue, and (0.67:0.33) gray.

2.3 PEDOT:Xanthan Gum Scaffolds
for Hosting and
Monitoring 3D Cell Cultures
As recently demonstrated, conducting
scaffolds can be used as platforms for cell sensing. The cell growth
and colonization of the scaffold brings changes in its electrochemical
impedance.42 This change can be used to
track cell growth. Prior to these experiments, the cell growth and
stability of these scaffolds in cell media was assessed. Only one
type of scaffold was selected to undergo the cell study. The scaffold
PEDOT:xanthan gum (0.5:0.5) 2 wt % was selected because it showed
a good compromise between mechanical stability and porosity. For that
MDCK II eGFP cells were seeded on a sterilized scaffold (Figure 7) with a density
of 0.22 ± 0.05 g·cm–3 and swelling behavior
included in Figure S1 (Supporting Information), reaching equilibrium within 24 h. MDCK II eGFP cells present a
constitutive expression of GFP protein without any requirement of
media additives for the expression of green fluorescent protein over
time. Therefore, we were able to dynamically evaluate cell growth
into the scaffold by fluorescent analysis using conventional media.
After 7 days of culture at 37 °C, 5% CO2, scaffolds
maintained their structural integrity and we observed satisfactory
coverage. We were able to observe good cell attachment and high degree
of pore coverage presumed to be due to the roughness of the structure.
Through the interconnection of pores within the structure, cells were
able to migrate throughout almost the whole scaffold.

content scaffold 14 days after culture, 37 °C, 5% CO2. (a) Confocal microscopy image of the entire scaffold 14 days after
cell seeding and (b) zoomed image of the scaffold 14 days after cell
seeding.

Knowing that the PEDOT:xanthan
gum scaffolds can efficiently facilitate
cell culture, we investigated the electrical properties by means of
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and studied their evolution
during cell growth as an in situ tool to monitor cell growth. For
this experiment, we used MDCK II LifeAct, which has been previously
used as an MDCK II cell line growing in a PEDOT:PSS scaffold,20 demonstrating their ability to form an electrical
barrier and the same initial adhesion and proliferation rate as the
MDCK II eGFP cells. Cells were seeded on a sterilized scaffold PEDOT:xanthan
gum (0.5:0.5) 2 wt % and an electrode-based device was fabricated
as shown in Figure 8a. Specifically, gold electrodes were patterned on top of glass substrates,
while a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) “well” was used
to confine the scaffolds inside the electrode area. The Ag/AgCl/KCl
(3 M) reference electrode and platinum (Pt) mesh counter electrode
were immobilized inside the wells. Figure 8b–d shows the cell growth on the PEDOT:xanthan
gum scaffold after 7 days of cell culture. The impedance data (presented
as Bode plot) of Figure 8e revealed a significant increase in the impedance value of almost
an order of magnitude (from |Z| ≈ 4.5 kΩ
to |Zcell| ≈ 45 kΩ) in the
case of cells containing scaffolds, in the low frequency regime (0.1–100
Hz). Although both sets of phase data (Figure 8f) (with and without cells) appeared to generate
two time constants, an increase of ∼22° (from φ
≈ 52° to φcell ≈ 74°) along
with a shift toward lower frequencies is apparent. Such changes indicate
the introduction of additional capacitance elements in the circuit,
which corresponds to the growth of insulating cell layers in the pores
of the scaffold.43 A less pronounced change
can be observed for mid to high frequencies, with a slight increase
in the impedance values most likely associated with the presence of
cells contributing to the increase of the Ohmic resistance at the
working electrode–electrolyte interface. The Nyquist plot of Figure 8g further confirmed
the effects of cell growth inside the scaffold. Specifically, an increase
in the radius of the semicircle in the case of control experiments
was achieved by incubating (at 37 °C) an identical PEDOT:xanthan
gum scaffold in cell media for 7 days (dashed line in Figure 8e–g). A slight increase
in the magnitude of impedance can be observed, which is accompanied
by a small change in the phase angle. This can be likely attributed
to gradual changes in the chemical composition of PEDOT scaffolds
or to the presence of cell culture medium.11 Nevertheless, this cannot override the effects of cell growth in
the scaffold-based electrode. It should be noted that because of the
fluctuations in the pore homogeneity, the effect of cell growth on
the measured impedance values may vary. The abovementioned findings
are consistent with previous EIS studies of 3D cell cultures in PEDOT-based
conducting scaffolds.20

3 Conclusions
In this
article, a new synthetic strategy for preparing conducting
PEDOT:xanthan gum scaffolds with the ability to host and monitor cells
is presented. Soft and flexible conducting scaffolds were obtained
by first synthesizing and second freeze-drying PEDOT:xanthan gum dispersions.
The mechanical properties and porosity of the conducting scaffolds
can be tuned with the concentration of the dispersion and the ratio
in between the conducting polymer and polysaccharide. Scaffold pore
size ranges between 10 and 150 μm and Young’s moduli
range between 10 and 45 kPa, giving the possibility to optimize pore
size and stiffness according to the target cell culture. As a potential
application, these scaffolds show the ability to monitor cell growth
by measuring the impedance of the scaffolds at different times. In
future works in our laboratory, other polysaccharides (or mixtures
of polysaccharides) will be included in these scaffolds using this
synthetic methodology.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of PEDOT:Xanthan Gum Dispersions
PEDOT:xanthan
gum dispersions with 1, 2, and 3% solid content and
at different PEDOT:xanthan gum ratios were synthesized by oxidative
polymerization according to the following procedure. In a 25 mL round-bottom
flask containing 19.6 mL of Milli-Q water, 0.3, 0.27, 0.2, or 0.13
g of xanthan gum (Acros) was dissolved and purged with N2. Afterward, 0.1, 0.13, 0.2, or 0.27 g of EDOT monomer (Acros), together
with the 1.5 equiv of ammonium persulfate ((NH4)2S2O8, Sigma) and a catalytic amount (5 mg)
of iron(III) sulfate (Fe2(SO4)3 Sigma)
was added, respectively. The reaction solution was kept at 0 °C
until completion (144 h). The dispersions were purified by dialysis
with Milli-Q water and a regenerated cellulose dialysis membrane (12–14
kD) from SpectrumLabs. Finally, dispersions containing different PEDOT:xanthan
gum ratios were obtained by varying the initial amount of grams (0.25:0.75,
0.33:0.67, 0.5:0.5, and 0.67:0.33).

4.1.1 Dispersion
Characterization
UV–vis–NIR
measurements were taken with UV/vis/NIR spectrometer PerkinElmer Lambda
950. Employing quartz cuvettes, a 2 v/v % solution in Milli-Q water
of each PEDOT:xanthan gum dispersion was analyzed. Spectra were normalized.
The kinetics of the polymerization reaction of PEDOT:xanthan gum (0.5:0.5)
2 wt % were monitored during 7 days by HPLC using a Hewlett-Packard
HPLC series 1100 equipment with a Lichrosphere 100 CN (5 μm)
column supplied by Agilent Technologies. The eluent is water/acetonitrile
(ACN) 1:1 0.7 mL min–1 at room temperature (r.t.).
Reaction samples were taken every 30 min according to the following
procedure: 10 μL of the reaction sample mixture was added to
5 mL of ACN containing 1 μL of benzyl alcohol as the internal
standard and 20 μL of this solution is injected into the HPLC
equipment. EDOT concentration is calculated by plotting the area of
each EDOT peak (5.3 min retention time) in a calibration line. The
viscosity of the reaction solution was measured with an SV-10 Vibro-viscometer
from Malvern. For viscosity measurements, the dispersions were analyzed
without modification. The conductivity of the dispersions was calculated
on a four-point probe Veeco/Miller FPP5000 using layer resistivity
function.

4.2 Scaffold Preparation by
Freeze-Drying
PEDOT:PSS (Heraeous PH 1000) (0.5 g) per 10
mL of dispersion and
0.1 g of DVS (Acros) per 10 mL of dispersion were added to each PEDOT:xanthan
gum dispersion. Scaffolds were formed by freeze-drying this polymeric
mixture with a LyoQuest-85 apparatus from Telstar. After freeze-drying,
the scaffolds were heated up at 50 °C for 1 h at mild vacuum
(0.5 bar) for evaporation of DVS in excess. Scaffolds were freeze-dried
in cylindrical PDMS (from Dow Corning) molds of two dimensions: 8
mm diameter and 8 mm height for mechanical testing and 3 mm diameter
and 2 mm height for impedance measurements and cell culture.

4.2.1 Scaffold Characterization
Scaffolds
were characterized by SEM and mechanically using Instron. SEM images
were taken with a Zeiss Sigma FESEM equipment. With an Instron apparatus,
the compressive moduli of the dry and hydrated scaffolds (submerged
2 h in standard Dulbecco’s PBS solution) were calculated. The
Instron had a load cell of 1 kN and the compression speed was set
at 1 mm min–1. Young’s modulus values were
calculated from the slope of the linear part of the strain stress
curve. Scaffold density was calculated according to their volume and
weight. Swelling analysis of the scaffolds in cell media was calculated
by measuring the wet scaffold weight at certain time intervals after
removing excess surface media.

4.3 Scaffold
Cell Culture
MDCK II cells
were kindly provided by Frederic Luton (IPMC, Valbonne). MDCK II LifeAct
cells were prepared for this study in the same manner according to
the manufacturer guidelines (Ibidi, GmbH) and as described previously
using pCMVLifeAct-TagRFP.44 Cells were
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium low glucose supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 × 10–3 M glutamine,
50 U mL–1 penicillin, and 50 μg·mL–1 streptomycin. To keep pressure on the fluorescent
actin expression, 500 μg·mL–1 geneticin
was added to the media. MDCK II eGFP (gift from Frederic Luton) was
cultured in the same media as MDCK II cells.

Prior to any experiment,
scaffolds were dipped into ethanol 70% for 1 h for sterilization and
then washed three times 1 h each with sterile water to ensure that
all ethanol was removed. Scaffolds were kept in cell media for 1 h
before being dried using sterile absorbers. Scaffolds were dipped
into 2 mL of 6 × 106 MDCK II cells in suspension allowing
cell penetration by capillarity. After cell seeding, the scaffolds
were incubated for 1 night at 37 °C to allow the cells to adhere,
after which 5 mL of fresh media was added to the well and half-changed
every 2 days until scaffolds were ready.

4.3.1 Fluorescent
Images
MDCK II cells
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature.
The scaffolds were washed extensively with PBS and water before being
monitored under a epifluorescence/confocal microscope (AxioObserver
Z1 LSM 800 ZEISS).

4.3.2 Scaffold Electrical Characterization
Scaffolds were characterized by EIS using an Autolab potentiostat
in the frequency range 10–1 to 105 Hz.
A commercial Ag/AgCl/KCl (3 M) electrode from Metrohm and a platinum
mesh were employed as the reference and counter electrode, respectively.
The cell culture medium was the electrolyte solution.
