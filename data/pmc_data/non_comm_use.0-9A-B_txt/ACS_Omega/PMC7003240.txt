A microhydration study of sulfur
mustard (SM) was carried out using
M06-2X, B3LYP, B3LYP-D3, and MP2 levels of theory with the 6-311++G(2d,2p)
basis set. The changes in energetics, structural parameters and vibrational
wavenumbers following the addition of up to three discrete water molecules
to SM were analyzed. We observed slight changes in the geometry of
SM upon microhydration. The stability of hydrated clusters is due
to weak C–H···O–H hydrogen bonds. The
free energy change for the formation of the clusters is positive at
room temperature and becomes exergonic when the temperature decreases.
The infrared stretchings of C–Cl of SM and O–H of water
are redshifted upon the addition of water molecules. The findings
from this work add to the literature of hydrated SM and can be useful
in its detection and subsequent destruction.

1 Introduction
Chemical
warfare agents (CWAs) have plagued the world since their
initial use during World War I. These dangerous compounds have been
classified based on their mode of action on living organisms.1,2 One such category is known as blister agents or vesicants and regroups
chemicals which, upon contact with the skin, invariably causes the
formation of blisters.1,2 The first blister agent used is
bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide and is commonly known as sulfur mustard
(SM),1,2 the structure of which is shown in Figure 1. SM is known for
its delayed but long-lasting harmful effects.3 It can easily be synthesized and can penetrate various types of
fabrics.

Figure 1 Structure of SM.

The toxicity of SM results
from the alkylation reaction between
the sulfonium ion and essential biomolecules.1,2,4−6 The most damaging effect
of SM is its rapid and irreversible SN2 reaction with the
DNA nucleobases,1,2,4−6 a reaction for which no definite cure has been found
till now.1,2,7,8

Different methods have been used to neutralize
SM in the environment,
and one of them is hydrolysis.9 The hydrolysis
of SM in water is preceded by a relatively slow hydration step but
results in the formation of the nontoxic thiodiglycol (TDG) and hydrochloric
acid under pseudo-first-order conditions.10,11 Conversely, SM gives rise to relatively toxic polymeric sulfonium
products if a limited amount of water is used for the hydrolysis.11 As well as influencing the toxicity and reactivity12 of SM, water strongly affects the rate of the
SM hydrolysis reaction.11,13−18 For instance, on activated carbon, the rate of hydrolysis of SM
vapor is enhanced by the presence of increasing amounts of water in
the micropores of the textile material.13,14 Similar results
have been observed on nanosized metal oxides15−17 and peroxides18 used in the decontamination of SM and other
CWAs via hydrolysis. In some cases, the absence of water on the metal
oxide surfaces resulted in the formation of an alkoxide derivative
which remained strongly bound to the surface16,17 and thus reducing their ability to neutralize the CWA. On the other
hand, the volatility and evaporation rate of SM is barely affected
by humidity,19,20 and adsorptivity onto SiO2 nanoparticles.21

Interactions
between SM and water can occur in the atmosphere,22 water bodies,23 and
soil24,25 and on solid surfaces such as paint,26 concrete,24,27 or even in the human
body.4−6 SM forms a highly unstable sulfonium ion intermediate
via anchimeric assistance, which is a step accelerated in the presence
of water.4−6,12 In addition, during
the detection of SM in air samples using mass spectrometry, the presence
of water was found to influence detector responses,22 making the detection of its oxidized derivatives easier
than the detection of SM.

Hydrated microclusters formed by the
nerve agent sarin have been
probed to understand the impact of adding discrete water molecules
to its binding energies28 and the vibrational
wavenumber of the phosphate-water29 hydrogen
bond (H-bond). Different nerve agents and their simulants have been
microhydrated to determine the extent to which the simulants mimic
the properties of the original CWAs in solution.30 The elucidation of the reaction mechanism through which
discrete water molecules assist in reversing the lethal effects of
the blister agent lewisite by dithiols have also been studied.31,32

Over the past decades, theoretical studies on the DNA alkylation
reaction by SM and its nitrogen mustard analogue, mechlorethamine
(mec), have also been carried out to understand the mechanism involved
in the toxicity of SM.33−36 A comparison of the reaction in the gas and aqueous phases revealed
that the activation barrier for the SM-DNA adduct formed increases
when the reaction was carried out in an implicit water solvation model.
Ab initio molecular dynamics studies by Mann35 on mec showed that the specific binding and positioning of explicit
water molecules in the first hydration sphere of mec strongly influences
the formation of the cyclic aziridinium ion, analogous to the sulfonium
ion intermediate. A recent study on the alkylation of adenine and
guanine by mec by Larrañaga and co-workers36 showed that the use of the polarizable continuum model
(PCM)37 overestimates the barrier energy
and free energy for the formation of aziridinium. A comparison of
the reactivity of SM and mec toward DNA purine bases33 concluded that the sulfonium ion is more reactive than
the aziridinium ion, especially in the aqueous media.36

Although the addition of explicit water molecules
to other blister
agents such as lewisite,31,32 mec,35 and the aziridinium ion36 has
been studied, the microhydration of SM is not reported. This has driven
us toward the aim of this study, which was to investigate the interaction
of up to three discrete water molecules with SM. Within this aim,
we were interested in the binding energy, structural parameters, and
vibrational wavenumbers of the hydrated SM clusters using theoretical
methods.

2 Computational Details
All computations
were performed using Gaussian 09W38,39 at 298 K and
1 atm running on SEAGrid.40−43 GaussView 0544 and Chemcraft
1.745 software
were used to visualize the results, and all figures were generated
using the CYLview46 program.

Lach
and co-workers47 reported a conformational
analysis on SM using the BLYP with Grimme’s D2 dispersion correction
in static and molecular dynamics simulations using the Car–Parrinello
method with Troullier–Martins pseudopotentials for the core
electrons of the molecule. These reported conformers of SM were revisited
by using the B3LYP48,49 functional together with the
6-311++G(2d,2p) basis set for all atoms. This particular method was
chosen to compare our results to the microhydration of sarin.28 The most stable conformer of SM, shown in Figure 2, was identified
as A. The other minimum structures are labeled alphabetically
based on their relative stability and are listed in the Supporting
Information in Table S1.

Figure 2 Three lowest energy conformers
of SM and their ZPE-corrected relative
stability in kcal/mol computed at B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p) given in parentheses.

Hydrated SM clusters originating from A were optimized
using the B3LYP, M06-2X,50 B3LYP-D3,51 and MP252−57 levels of theory with the 6-311++G(2d,2p) basis set. For the monohydrated
complexes, a single water molecule was added to A at
different positions and orientations. For the di- and trihydrated
clusters, an ensemble of structures was considered whereby the water
dimer and trimer were added to A.

All complexes
incorporating n water molecules
(for n = 1–3) are regrouped under the label Gn (Generation n), a term introduced by Michaux
and co-workers.58 All complexes are labeled
as An-m, where A refers to the A conformer of SM, n represents the number of water molecules,
and m is an integer of increasing value representing
the relative stability of the complex within the generation considered.
The effect of water as bulk solvation on SM was also investigated
using the PCM37 solvation model.

Frequency computations were carried out to check the nature of
the stationary points. Selected IR wavenumbers influenced by the formation
of H-bonds in the most stable SM·nH2O clusters of each Gn were identified using
VEDA459,60 and GaussView 0544 programs. The computed harmonic wavenumbers are generally overestimated
compared to their experimental counterparts, and thus scale factors
of 0.94761 for M06-2X/6-311++G(2d,2p) and
0.96361 for B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p) methods
were used for better agreement between the computed harmonic wavenumbers
and their experimental counterparts. For the wavenumbers computed
using B3LYP-D3 and MP2 with the 6-311++G(2d,2p) basis set, the unscaled
values are reported. We report the results obtained from M06-2X/6-311++G(2d,2p)
computations as this method performs well for systems involving organic
molecules and noncovalent interactions.62 The results obtained from the other three methods are provided as
part of the Supporting Information.

The binding energies (BEs) were calculated using the equations 1   2  

ΔEBEZPE + BSSE is the binding electronic
energy of the complex corrected for zero-point energy (ZPE) and basis
set superposition error (BSSE). The BSSE correctional value was obtained
using the counterpoise method.63,64 The ΔGBE is the binding free energy of the hydrated
complexes, and E(SM·nH2O) and G(SM·nH2O) are the electronic and free energies of the hydrated SM,
respectively. The E(SM) and G(SM)
and the E(H2O)n and G(H2O)n are the electronic and free energies of isolated SM and isolated n water molecules, respectively.

The enthalpy and
entropy of the hydrated complexes are also calculated
using equations similar to eq 2. The ΔHBE and ΔSBE are used to represent the change in enthalpy
and entropy upon formation of the hydrated complexes, respectively.
The H(SM·nH2O), H(SM), and H(H2O)n are the enthalpy of the hydrated SM, the isolated
SM, and the isolated n water molecules, respectively.
The S(SM·nH2O), S(SM), and S(H2O)n are used to represent the entropy of the hydrated
SM, the isolated SM, and the isolated n water molecules,
respectively.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Conformational Search
Twenty-two
conformers of SM were located using the B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p) method
(Figure S1). Conformer A is
the most stable one, and this is in agreement with previous studies.47,65,66 However, the relative stability
of the other conformers differ from the results of Lach and co-workers.47A was used as the free SM molecule
to which discrete water molecules were subsequently added. The atom
labelings and torsional angles of SM are defined in Scheme S1. The structure of all the conformers of SM along
with their relative stability obtained using B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p)
are shown in Figure S1, and their torsional
angles are listed in Table S1.

3.2 Effect of Discrete Solvent Molecules and Bulk
Solvation on the Properties of SM
3.2.1 Microhydration:
Effect on Energetics
The addition of discrete water molecules
to A gave rise
to three monohydrated, seven dihydrated, and nine trihydrated complexes
when the M06-2X/6-311++G(2d,2p) method was used. The SM·nH2O (for n = 1–3) complexes
obtained are shown in Figure 3, and their binding energy, enthalpy, entropy, and free energy
values are summarized in Table 1. The hydrated complexes obtained using the other three levels
of theory are displayed in Figures S2–S4, and their energy and thermodynamic parameters are listed in Tables S3–S5.

using the M06-2X/6-311++G(2d,2p)
method, and these are arranged in order of decreasing relative stability
within each generation. Atom labelings are also included.

The
monohydrated structures obtained at the MP2 level of theory
are comparable to the M06-2X results, while those obtained at B3LYP
and B3LYP-D3 show slight variations in the number of H-bonds formed
(Figures S3–S5), which affects the
relative stability and binding electronic, enthalpy, entropy, and
free energies of the hydrated complexes. It is worth pointing out
that one of the starting structures of A with the dimer
of water leads to a C dihydrated complex (Figure S6). All the complexes obtained have positive
ΔGBE values, which is due to the
decrease in entropy accompanying the combination of n water molecules with A to form a single entity.

The A1-1 structure is the most stable of the three
monohydrated complexes at M06-2X, B3LYP, B3LYP-D3, and MP2 levels,
with a relatively large ΔEBEZPE + BSSEvalues of
−6.75, −2.34, −5.83, and −4.45 kcal/mol,
respectively. The greater stability of the A1-1 complex
compared to the other two monohydrated structures at all levels of
theory is due to the larger number of H-bonding formed and, in particular,
the involvement of four C–H···O–H interactions
at M06-2X, B3LYP-D3, and MP2 levels and three C–H···O–H
for the B3LYP level of theory.

Increasing the number of explicit
water molecules in the complexes
increases the magnitude of the ΔEBEZPE + BSSE, ΔEBEZPE, and ΔGBE values. The increase in binding energy may be explained on the basis
of the effect of cooperativity between the water dimer and A, which forms larger cyclic networks of H-bonds than the water monomer
does with A. As a result of the larger ring sizes resulting
from H-bonding, a reinforcement of the H-bonds occurs, leading to
the lower ΔEBEZPE + BSSEvalues of the dihydrated
complexes compared to the monohydrated ones. Similar observations
are made when the hydrated clusters are compared at B3LYP, B3LYP-D3,
and MP2 levels of theory.

For the trihydrated complexes, all
four ab initio methods give
similar structures with very few clusters showing slight variations
in the distances and orientation of the water molecules. The three
solvent molecules occupy the first hydration shell in all clusters
except for A3-4 and A3-8, where two and
one water molecules, respectively, lie in the first shell, while the
remaining water molecule(s) are in the second hydration shell. These
complexes are the third and fourth most unstable structures of the G3 group with relatively large and positive ΔGBE values. The relative stability among the
SM·3H2O aggregates differ for each level of theory.
The M06-2X, B3LYP-D3, and MP2 levels of theory predict the A3-1 complex as the most stable structure when three water molecules
are added to A, while B3LYP predicts the A3-4 structure of M06-2X as the most stable trihydrated complex.

The trends in ΔEBEZPE with and without BSSE and ΔGBE for the most stable SM·nH2O for each Gn are shown in Figure 4a,b. Increasing the
number of water molecules present around SM affects the ΔEBEZPE + BSSE, ΔEBEZPE, and the ΔGBE in a nonlinear way. Along with the increase in the number of molecules,
a rise in the BSSE correctional values can also be noted. Applying
the correction for BSSE decreases the magnitudes of the ΔEBEZPEof the clusters as shown in Table 1 and Figure 4a.

the free binding energy with the number of water molecules present

3.2.2 Microhydration: Effect on Structure
In all the cases considered, the addition of discrete water molecules
has a negligible effect on the isolated structure of A. Similar observations have been made for the aziridinium ion of
mec when it was microhydrated with one to four water molecules.36 For the most stable mono-, di-, and trihydrated
complexes of SM, the C–Cl bonds involved in the H-bonding are
extended by 0.01, 0.02, and 0.01 Å, respectively, at all four
levels of theory. This bond is also lengthened in all other complexes
where the C–Cl fragment is bound to water molecules by similar
values. Likewise, the bond and torsional angles of A are
barely affected when water molecules are added, changing by less than
9° for all the methods used. In the A3–7 trihydrated
complex, the two gauche torsional angles are both changed from 82°
to 51° and 61° when M06-2X was used. A similar large decrease
in torsional angle is observed at the MP2 level, but computations
using B3LYP and B3LYP-D3 for the same trihydrated complex results
in less drastic changes in the torsional angles of A.
The structural parameters of the most stable complexes are reported
in Table 2 for M06-2X
and Tables S6–S8 for the other three
methods used.

In all the complexes
formed, the H-bonding motifs are cyclic in
nature and consist of five- to eight-membered rings systems between
SM and water. Cyclic H-bonding networks are usually favored over other
possible arrangements due to the occurrence of cooperative effects
between the single donors and acceptors of the ring, which strengthen
the interaction and further stabilize the complex relative to the
isolated starting molecules. Moreover, anticooperativity, which occur
due to the formation of H-bonds between a single donor (or acceptor)
and multiple acceptors (or donors), is also known to contribute to
the stability of H-bonded complexes.67 The
H-bonding distances between the H atom of the donor (X–H) and
acceptor atoms (Y) and the H-bonding angle (X–H···Y)
are reported in Table 3 for the M06-2X level of
theory. The same parameters for B3LYP, B3LYP-D3, and MP2 are reported
in Tables S9–S11 and are comparable
to the values obtained at the M06-2X level for the same complexes.
Based on the distances and angles of the noncovalent interactions
observed, most of the H-bonds are weak. In particular, the C–H···O–H
interaction has H-bond lengths of greater than 2.50 Å and bond
angles of less than 130° in the majority of the clusters, emphasizing
its weak nature. Nevertheless, the involvement of multiple C–H···O–H
bonds at the same time directly accounts for the greater relative
stability of certain complexes within the same generation, as demonstrated
clearly by the A1-1, A2-1, A2-2, and A3-1 complexes.

a Values given in parentheses are
the changes in vibrational wavenumbers relative to the isolated A and n water cluster, respectively.

b Experimental vibrational wavenumbers
of isolated SM.68

In general, harmonic wavenumbers calculated theoretically
are overestimated
compared to experimental IR wavenumbers. The values obtained for gaseous A using M06-2X and MP2 are found to differ by at least 100
cm–1 from those obtained experimentally. The use
of a scale factor becomes necessary for better agreement with experimental
or highly accurate theoretically predicted spectroscopic data. Table 4 shows the scaled
wavenumbers obtained using M06-2X/6-311++G(2d,2p) for the water clusters,
the nonhydrated A, and the most stable hydrated complexes
of SM in each generation. The scaled IR vibrational wavenumbers obtained
using B3LYP and those unscaled obtained using B3LYP-D3 and MP2 for
the compounds are provided in Tables S11–S13.

The IR spectra of A and the most stable hydrated
SM·nH2O complexes along with the
spectra of isolated n water clusters are shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 IR spectra of the isolated A and water clusters and
the most stable SM·nH2O complexes.

Microhydrating SM with one to three water molecules
results in
the appearance of new peaks in the spectra of the CWA in the 0–500
cm–1 region, which corresponds to the intermolecular
H-bonds formed in all the hydrated complexes. The C–Cl stretching
modes of SM are split and redshifted by 19 and 27 cm–1 in A1-1, forming two very close peaks that remain at
almost the same wavenumbers even as the number of water molecules
in the complex increases. On the other hand, the C–H bonds
next to S (internal C–H) and Cl (external C–H) atoms
are blueshifted by relatively small values. The increase in wavenumber
for stretching C–H is a phenomenon often encountered when sp3-hybridized alkyl moieties act as a H-bond donor in complexes
due to small reductions in the C–H bond length.69

The most notable changes in IR wavenumbers
occur for the stretching
O–H modes of water in the hydrated clusters of SM when compared
to the isolated water clusters in the gas phase. For the n = 1 solvent molecule, the symmetric, asymmetric stretching and bending
modes of the bonded O–H of water in A1-1 are redshifted
by 36, 30, and 33 cm–1, respectively, compared to
a single isolated water molecule.

In the A2-1 complex,
the stretching and bending modes
of O–H of water are split and shifted to a different extent
depending on the binding positions of the water molecule and whether
the O–H is free or bonded to an acceptor or donor in SM. The
peak corresponding to the O–H H-bonded to the second water
molecule is redshifted by 86 cm–1 upon binding to A. The single free O–H bonding in A2-1 vibrates at a higher wavenumber than the remaining three bonded
O–H stretch peaks with a shift of −24 cm–1 compared to the isolated water dimer. The more pronounced change
in wavenumber is indicative of the stronger H-bonding between the
two polar water molecules than between the hydrophobic SM and water.

For the trihydrated A3-1 complex, the stretching O–H
modes are redshifted to a greater extent compared to the A2-1 complex. The free and bonded O–H stretch modes of three water
molecules in the isolated water trimer formed two separate peaks,
which are split in the spectrum of A3-1 due to their
participation or nonparticipation in H-bonding. The two O–H
bonds that remain free in A3-1 are redshifted by 21 and
29 cm–1 and form two extremely close peaks, while
the O–H bound to Cl is redshifted by 66 cm–1 and forms a separate peak of greater intensity.

The bonded
O–H modes, which were previously bound to other
water molecules in the isolated trimer, give rise to three distinct
peaks in the spectrum of A3-1. Of these, two stretching O–H modes are redshifted, while one is blueshifted.
The extent of the redshift is influenced by the number of H-donors
and acceptors of A bound to the water molecule. The water
molecule forming weak acceptor H-bonds with two C–H and strong
donor and acceptor bonds with the other two water molecules forms
the most intense peak in the trihydrated complex spectrum and shows
the largest redshift of 103 cm–1.

In contrast,
the water molecule forming a single strong donor H-bond
with another water molecule and weaker bonds with five different H-donors
forms the second most intense peak, which is shifted by −33
cm–1. The blueshifted O–H peak arises from
the water molecule acting as a double donor, forming weak H-bonds
with Cl and another water molecule and a strong bond with the third
water molecule in the complex. The increase in the IR wavenumber of
O–H is also observed in A3-2 and A3-7 both of which also have lower dipole moment than A.
This unusual increase in wavenumber is observed at all the levels
of theory considered.

3.2.4 Bulk Solvation of SM
Using PCM
The structural parameters of A in
water change negligibly
compared to the gas phase. The largest change in the geometry is an
increase of 0.01 Å in the two C–Cl bonds at all levels
of theory. The electronic solvation and Gibbs free solvation energies
of A with the M06-2X functional are both −4.66
kcal/mol. The corrected solvation free energy70 using the same functional is −8.44 kcal/mol. The solvation
free energy is comparable to those obtained using the three other
methods (Table S14). These values indicate
the stabilization of the A molecule in the presence of
a bulk solvent. When discrete water molecules were added, the free
binding energies are all positive values due to the lower entropy
of the microsolvated complex with respect to the separate SM and water
molecules.

3.3 Comparison with Other Chemical
Warfare Agents
Compared to the microhydrated sarin conformers
at B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p)
studied by Alam and co-workers,28 the addition
of discrete water molecules to SM give rise to more varied H-bonding
networks and binding positions for n = 1–3
water molecules. The structures of both CWAs are negligibly affected
by the presence of discrete water molecules in their hydration spheres.
The ΔEBEZPE + BSSE values of the most stable
SM·nH2O clusters have slightly lower
magnitudes than those of sarin·nH2O, while the ΔGBE values of the
blister agent are higher. The reason for the difference in energies
is directly related to the chemical structure of the CWAs and the
binding positions of water in the hydrated complexes. For sarin, water
binds to the polar P=O bond, while in SM, the water molecules
bind to less polar bonds and atoms. The energy difference is further
illustrated when the solvation of the two CWAs is considered: sarin
dissolves much more readily in aqueous solutions than SM at 25 °C.71

Nanoparticles can hydrolyze SM into TDG,
and the presence of water is known to accelerate the hydrolysis reaction.
The general model proposed17,18,20 is that SM is first adsorbed onto the surface of the nanoparticle
and reacts with free weakly bound water molecules present on the surface
of the nanoparticle. The water molecules assist in the breaking of
C–Cl bond and results in the formation of the sulfonium ion.
In the molecular dynamics simulations of Mann,35 the cleavage of C–Cl for the mec molecule was observed
to occur after the closest solvent molecules formed H-bonds with the
Cl atom after which it lengthened and broke. The reactive sulfonium
intermediate formed on the nanoparticle then reacted with hydroxyl
or water nucleophiles and was liberated as TDG.

The binding
energies of SM with DNA bases were calculated using
the B3LYP/6-31+G(d) method and found to be −36 and −22
kcal/mol in the gas and aqueous phases (PCM) at the N7 of the guanine
DNA base, respectively.33 The large difference
in energy between SM-DNA adducts and SM·nH2O complies with in vivo experimental observations: SM tends
to attack purine DNA bases in the aqueous cellular environment rather
than undergo hydrolysis despite its instability in aqueous media after
hydration.12 Larrañaga and co-workers36 modeled the alkylation of DNA by aziridinium
microhydrated with two water molecules and concluded that the presence
of water in the hydration shells lowers the activation barrier for
the aziridinium formation, which precedes the DNA alkylation reaction
step. Further, the water present in the first hydration sphere of
aziridinium then form H-bonds with the approaching DNA molecule, aiding
in the SN2 reaction.

4 Conclusions
The microhydration of the harmful blister agent sulfur mustard
with n = 1 to 3 explicit water molecules was studied
theoretically. From the symmetrical global minimum A,
three monohydrated, seven dihydrated, and nine trihydrated complexes
were obtained at all levels of theory used. The n water molecules added occupied the first hydration shell of the
CWA in all the clusters optimized except for two trihydrated structures
where the second and third water molecules entered the second solvation
shell.

The water molecules form weak hydrogen bonds with the
different
donors and acceptors of hydrogen in A, resulting in negligible
effects on its geometry. The only notable exception observed is the
lengthening of the C–Cl bond by 0.01–0.02 Å in
the different complexes where water binds to the Cl atom. This particular
bond is responsible for the reactivity of SM, and its cleavage is
known to be enhanced in aqueous media. A case of conformational change
was also observed in which A adopted the structure of
the third most stable conformer of SM. Nevertheless, this complex
has a relatively higher positive free binding energy compared to the
remaining dihydrated complexes. The binding energies of the clusters
become increasingly negative as the number of water molecules added
is raised. This highlights the role of water molecules in stabilizing
the hydrated complexes compared to the isolated SM molecule. On the
other hand, the free binding energy becomes more positive as the change
in entropy becomes more negative. The occurrence of the noncovalent
interactions is reflected in the appearance of new peaks in the 0–500
cm–1 region of the IR spectra of the hydrated SM
and the noticeable shifts in the O–H stretching wavenumbers
of water. Increasing the number of water molecules enhances theses
effects and can aid in the identification of SM by IR spectroscopy
in situations where the CWA is suspected to have been released in
the environment.

Overall, the fundamental research on the microhydration
of SM complexes
can be particularly useful in creating hydrolysis reaction models,
especially on nanoparticles and metal–organic frameworks, to
support experimental research aimed toward the development of detection
and elimination techniques for SM. It can also be used in computational
studies on the toxicology of SM to provide a more complete description
of the situation and aid in combatting the CWA.
