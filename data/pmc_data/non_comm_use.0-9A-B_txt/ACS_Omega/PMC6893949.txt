We describe a one-pot synthesis method for carbon filament-supported
mixed metal oxide nanoparticles. The thermal intracrystalline reaction
of adamantanecarboxylate ions confined inside interlayer galleries
of layered double hydroxide materials under a reducing atmosphere
(H2) leads to carbon filaments forming in situ within the
material. Raman spectroscopy and combined microscopy techniques show
the formation of hybrid organic–inorganic carbon filaments
with the mixed metal oxide particles interleaved.

1 Introduction
Intracrystalline reactions
are a well-known phenomenon in layered
materials.1 Due to host–guest interactions
and the confined structure, dynamics and reactivity of the interlayer
region, graphite,2,3 cationic aluminosilicate clay
minerals,4,5 metal phosphonates,6−8 and metal chalcogenides9,10 have all been used to enable and control different kinds of intracrystalline
reactions to develop novel functional materials, as well as to control
the stereochemistry of reacting interlayer guests.11,12 The confining interlayer galleries, often only one or two molecule
lengths in height, of host layered solids are an ideal place to prepare
guest nanomaterials, delivering multifunctionality to the host–guest
structure.13 These hybrid host–guest
materials have significant industrial and technological importance.14−19

Among layered solids, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are
an increasingly
studied class of materials.20 LDHs have
the general formula [M1–x2+Mx3+(OH)2]x+(A–x/n)·yH2O, where, by
way of example, M2+ = Mg, Co, Ni, Ca, and Zn; M3+ = Al, Fe, and Ga; A = anion (organic or inorganic ions); 0.15 ≥ x ≤ 0.33; and 0.5 ≥ y ≤
1.0.21,22 Due to their physicochemical properties,
LDHs have gained attention in recent times in the field of catalysis,
sorption, polymer nanocomposites, host–guest chemistry, medicine,
inter alia.23 At present, research on LDHs
is focused on developing hybrid materials with multifunctional properties,
for improved and wider applications.24−26 Mixed metal oxides (MMOs),
prepared by thermal treatment of LDHs, find applications in industrially
relevant chemical processes, forming a significant contribution of
all heterogeneous base-catalyzed industrial chemistry.27,28 The properties and the applications of MMOs can be tuned by changing
the layered metal hydroxide precursor composition, morphology, and
texture.29 MMOs with insulating, semiconducting,
magnetic, and superconducting properties can also be prepared.30

LDHs and related MMOs have become widely
used owing to their (a)
homogeneous distribution of metal ions,31 (b) diverse tunable composition, (c) easy synthesis protocol, and
(d) economic and environmentally benign life cycle. MMOs often encounter
sustainability issues due to poor thermal, mechanical, and recycling
stability, limiting the number of reuses possible. To exploit these
materials at the industrial scale, an immediate challenge is to address
these inherent limitations.

Attempts have been made to address
catalyst regeneration, including
through using catalyst support materials such as graphene oxide (GO),
carbon nanotubes (CNT), carbon nanofibers, mesoporous silica, ceramic
oxides, inter alia.32−35 These supported MMOs are found to be better than unsupported MMOs
for various applications such as gas adsorption, organic conversions,
and electrode materials for batteries and supercapacitors.36−42 Generally, all these methods are multistep and add significant cost
to the life cycle of the materials. Moreover, all these supports are
provided as additives during/after the synthesis and result in less
even distribution of the catalyst on the support. To overcome this,
it is of importance to design and develop a novel method of synthesis
where the catalyst is coformed with the support material. Additionally,
if the support comes within the LDH, the synthesis process will become
more sustainable.

Recently, diamondoids (molecules based on
the adamantane structure)
and their derivatives have been successfully incorporated inside carbon
nanotubes (CNTs) and converted in situ into carbon nanowires/nanochains.43,44 Here, we report the synthesis of adamantanecarboxylate intercalated
Mg-Al LDHs and successful conversion of the material into carbon filaments
with supported mixed metal oxide particles. Mg-Al LDHs intercalated
with adamantanecarboxylic acid were synthesized by employing an efficient
one-pot protocol as described in our previous paper showing excellent
thermal stability.45

2 Results and Discussion
The synthesized
adamantanecarboxylate was characterized by powder
X-ray diffraction (PXRD), with a typical diffraction pattern shown
in Figure S1 (Supporting Information).
The d spacing of 20.6 Å corresponds to a bilayer
arrangement of adamantanecarboxylate ions in the interlayer space.46 Higher order reflections of the 20.6 Å
basal spacing are at 10.2, 6.8, and 4.1 Å. The intercalated adamantanecarboxylate
anions were further characterized by infrared (IR) and solid-state 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (SS-NMR) spectroscopies.
The IR spectrum (see Figure S2, Supporting
Information) shows carboxylate (COO–) stretching
vibrations at 1517 and 1395 cm–1 and vibrations
due to CH2 and CH bond stretching at 2900 and 2847 cm–1, respectively. The broad absorption feature centered
around 3400 cm–1 is due to hydrogen-bonded metal
hydroxide group O–H stretching and hydrogen-bonded intercalated
water.47 The 1H SS-NMR spectrum
of the sample (shown in Figure S3, Supporting
Information) shows a sharp peak at 1.01 ppm corresponding to the CH2 protons of the adamantane ring and a broad peak at 1.74 ppm
from CH protons of the adamantane ring.46 The other two peaks at 3.80 and 4.69 ppm are due to the protons
of the intercalated water in the interlayer region and the hydroxyl
groups in the metal hydroxide layer, respectively. The 13C NMR spectra of Mg-Al-adamantanecarboxylate (Figure S4, Supporting Information) shows four sharp peaks
in the low field region at 29.5, 37.3, 40.6, and 42.8 ppm due to the
four different carbon environments present in the adamantane group.
The peak at 186.98 ppm is due to the carbon of the carboxylate group
in the adamantanecarboxylate.46The analyses
confirm the successful preparation of the adamantanecarboxylate Mg-Al
LDH material.

The resultant adamantanecarboxylate Mg-Al LDH
material was converted
into carbon filaments with supported Mg-Al MMO material by calcining
the LDH at 600 °C under a reducing atmosphere of H2 gas. The PXRD pattern of the resultant carbon-supported MMOs (Figure 1) shows the reflections
at 6.40 Å (13.81° 2θ), 2.54 Å (35.2° 2θ),
2.44 Å (36.9° 2θ), 2.10 Å (42.89° 2θ),
and 1.49 Å (62.30° 2θ). Generally, the thermal decomposition
of a typical Mg-Al LDH would be expected to show crystalline MgO peaks
in the PXRD pattern as the material phase separates to give MgO and
amorphous aluminum phases, followed by reflections indicating spinel
formation at higher temperature.

Figure 1 PXRD pattern of the hybrid material generated
from reductive decomposition
of adamantanecarboxylate intercalated Mg-Al LDH. The d spacing values are in Å.

Thermally decomposed intercalated anions generally
escape as gases,
depending on the nature of the anion (e.g., carbonate readily forms
CO2). In the present case, the reflection at 2.44 Å
(36.9° 2θ), 2.10 Å (42.89° 2θ), and 1.49
Å (62.30° 2θ) correspond to 111, 200, and 220 planes
of the MgO phase, respectively, although these are atypically broadened.48 The reflection at 6.40 Å (13.81° 2θ)
and 2.54 Å (35.2° 2θ) are unusual for MMOs formed
from LDHs, and the 6.4 Å reflection is closely matching with
that of a graphite oxide peak, vide infra. The origin of this peak
could also be from the formation of the hybrid compound involving
MMOs and carbonaceous material suggesting incomplete removal of the
anion.49

The IR spectrum of the reduced
MMO material is given in Figure S5 (Supporting
Information) and shows
vibrations at 3391, 2982, 2971, 2892, 2648, 1640, and 1394 cm–1. Inorganic LDH-based MMOs formed under similar conditions
show no stretching or bending modes in the range of 4000–1000
cm–1 in the IR region and show metal–oxygen
(M–O) vibrations and breathing modes below 1000 cm–1.50 The absorptions at 2982 and 2892 cm–1 can be assigned to the CH2 and CH stretching
of hydrocarbons, respectively. The broad feature centered around 3390
cm–1 is due to hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl group stretches.
The vibration at 1640 cm–1may be due to C=C
stretching. Figure S5 further shows three
distinct vibrational modes in the C–H region (2982, 2971, and
2892 cm–1) as opposed to the two in the parent LDH
(2900 and 2847 cm–1). There is shift in the IR frequency
of CH2 and CH vibration from 2900 to 2982 cm–1 and from 2847 to 2892 cm–1 upon conversion from LDH to MMOs, indicating the
change in the nature of the adamantanecarboxylate. The IR spectrum
further confirms the presence of hydrocarbon in the resultant MMO
material. These observations, taken together, indicate retention and
conversion of intercalated adamantanecarboxylate ions in the narrow
galleries of hydroxide sheets under reductive calcination.

Solid-state 13C and 1H NMR techniques were
employed to further elucidate the structure of the MMO material. The 13C NMR spectrum (Figure 2a) shows two peaks at 33.5 and 126 ppm, and the peak
at 33.5 ppm indicates the presence of sp3carbon atoms.
The peak at 126 ppm is due to sp2 carbon and is attributed
to aromatic or alkene bonding. The 1H NMR spectrum (Figure 2b) shows a very broad
peak centered at 1.17 ppm and tailing until 15 ppm. As such, it is
difficult to assign protons to any specific functional groups. The
center of the peak, 1.17 ppm, is in between the methyl R–CH3 and methylene R–CH2–R proton signals.
The 27Al NMR spectra of the sample show two peaks at 9.14
and 70.69 ppm in the ratio of 3:2 (Figure S6, Supporting Information). The peak at 9.14 ppm corresponds to Al
ions in an octahedral environment, and the peak at 70.69 ppm corresponds
to the tetrahedral environment. The transition of Al in the MMOs from
octahedral to tetrahedral sites is expected during calcinations and
has been reported previously for similar LDH materials.51

the hybrid
material generated from reductive decomposition of adamantanecarboxylate
intercalated Mg-Al LDH.

The MMO material formed during reductive calcination
was further
characterized with Raman spectroscopy (Figure 3), showing the characteristic G and D bands
for carbon materials at 1595 and 1361 cm–1, respectively.
The intensity of the G band is higher than that of the D band, indicating
graphitic oxide-type carbon, rather than the reduced graphite oxide.52 An interesting feature of the Raman spectrum
is the band at 1859 cm–1, which.is associated
with linear carbon chains/wires.13 The
Raman spectra suggest that some of the confined intercalated adamantanecarboxylate
ions have transformed into a material similar to carbon chains/wires
under the reducing atmosphere.

from reductive decomposition
of adamantanecarboxylate intercalated Mg-Al LDH.

Zhang et al. have tried to convert adamantane molecules
into diamond
nanowires under a reducing atmosphere (H2), and the reaction
was found to be unsuccessful due to unfavorable energetics of the
reaction.45 The authors predicted that
to convert adamantane into linear carbon chains, less stable derivative
of diamondoids, for example, carboxylic acids, could be used as starting
materials. Here, the adamantanecarboxylate intercalated LDH calcined
under the reducing atmosphere is, in part, behaving as predicted by
the work of Feng et al.44

Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of the resultant MMOs
are given in Figure 4. SEM images clearly show two different particle types, having distinct
morphologies. The MMOs, with nanometer dimensions, can be seen dispersed
on aggregate bundles of carbon wires/chains (as shown in the arrows).
This again shows the formation of the layered hydroxides as MMOs and
intercalated adamantanecarboxylate ion as the carbonaceous support.

Figure 4 SEM images
of the hybrid material generated from reductive decomposition
of adamantanecarboxylate intercalated Mg-Al layered double hydroxide
(resultant nanocarbon wires/chains and MMOs are shown by arrows).

Electron microscopy was used to further study the
hybrid organic–inorganic
nature of the MMOs and the transformed intercalated adamantanecarboxylate
ion. The carbon chains/wires suggested in the Raman spectra were elucidated
further by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
images, as shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 (a, b) Bright field TEM images and (c, d) HRTEM images of the hybrid
material generated from reductive decomposition of adamantanecarboxylate
intercalated Mg-Al layered double hydroxide (resultant nanocarbon
wires/chains and MMOs are highlighted in image d). Scale bars in the
images (a) 500 nm, (b) 100 nm, (c) 5 nm, and (d) 2 nm.

The MMO aggregates/nanoparticles have dimensions
of approximately
20–50 nm as shown in Figure 5b. The large fibrous natured materials observed along
with MMOs in Figure 5b are carbon filaments originated from transformation of intercalated
adamantanecarboxylate ions. The individual carbon filaments appear
to be stacked together to form a bundle, having a diameter of around
10 nm. The shape and nature of the resultant carbon upon transformation
of adamantanecarboxylate ion is similar to the one observed for diamondoids
in the literature.43,44 Careful observation of these
filaments reveals the thickness of subunits to be around 0.3 to 0.4
nm. The highlighted circular objects in Figure 5d correspond to MMO nanoparticles sitting
on either side of the resultant carbon chains/wires (highlighted with
straight lines). This observation is similar to the one observed in
the SEM images (Figure 4). This indicates that the narrow galleries of LDHs facilitated the
growth and transformation of intercalated adamantanecarboxylate into
low dimensionality carbon structures (sheets/chains). At the same
time, the layered hydroxides are converted to MMOs resulting in the
formation of hybrid composite. For comparison, TEM images of the parent
LDH are given in Figure S7 (Supporting
Information) and show the large anisotropic layers of the organo-LDH
material.

The elemental composition of the MMOs was determined
by energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX), with the results shown in Figure S8 (Supporting Information). The MMO Mg/Al ratio is almost
equal to 2, as observed in the parent LDH precursor material. The
resultant hybrid shows that Mg and C have near equal proportions.
The peaks due to Cu originate from the grid used to mount the sample
on for analysis. The distribution of various elements in the resultant
nanocomposite was mapped using a scanning transmission electron microscopy
(STEM) technique, as shown in Figure 6. The distribution of Mg and C appears almost homogeneous
across the material analyzed. However, the distribution of Al suggests
that it has segregated into pockets.

(c) aluminum, and (d) carbon of the hybrid material generated from

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully
transformed an adamantanecarboxylate
intercalated Mg-Al LDH into a hybrid MMO material through reductive
calcination. The intercalated adamantanecarboxylate ion appears to
have transformed under hydrogen reduction into carbon filaments, interwoven
inside the confining galleries of the layered double hydroxides. The
resultant carbon filaments are supporting the MMO materials and offer
a potential facile route to high-surface-area hierarchical carbon-supported
nanoparticles with basic surface sites.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis
All reagents, Mg(OH)2, Al(OH)3, and 1-adamantanecarboxylic acid were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Deionized water
(18 MΩ cm resistivity, Millipore water purification system)
was used throughout the experiment. Adamantanecarboxylate intercalated
Mg-Al (Mg/Al =2) was synthesized by employing the cohydration method.
In a typical experiment, a stoichiometric amount of Mg(OH)2, Al(OH)3, and 1-adamantanecarboxylic acid (Al/adamantanecarboxylate
=1) was taken in 100 mL of water. The reaction mixture was stirred
at room temperature for an hour to get a homogeneous mixture. The
resultant reaction mixture was transferred to a Parr high-pressure
vessel and hydrothermally treated at 150 °C for 24 h. The resultant
LDH was recovered by filtration followed by drying at 65 °C for
overnight. The hybrid organic–inorganic nanocomposite of MMOs
and linear carbon chains/wires was synthesized by reductive decomposition
of Mg-Al-adamantanecarboxylate LDH under H2. In a typical
experiment, 1 g of LDH was loaded into a quartz tube and subjected
to decomposition at 600 °C under a hydrogen atmosphere. The ramp
rate was kept at 5 °C min–1, and the flow of
H2 was fixed at 100 mL min–1. Once the
desired temperature was reached (600 °C), the sample was held
at that temperature for 4 h. The sample was cooled down without any
control on the cooling rate.

4.2 Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) data was collected using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer
(θ–2θ scan, Cu Kα radiation, λ =
1.541 Å). Data was collected at a continuous scan rate of 2°
2θ min–1 between 2 and 70° 2θ.
Samples were gently ground powders and pressed into sample holders.
Infrared (IR) spectroscopy analyses of the samples were recorded in
the reflectance mode using a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 FT-IR spectrometer
in the attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode. Ground powder samples
of the LDH materials were used. The C, H, and N analyses on the LDH
samples were carried out by the Microanalysis service within the Chemistry
Department, Durham University. Approximately 3 mg of sample was placed
in a tin capsule and combusted in a high oxygen environment at 950
°C using an Exeter Analytical CE-440 elemental analyzer calibrated
with acetanilide. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies
(1H and 13C) were carried out using a Varian
VNMRS spectrometer in the Solid State NMR facility at the Department
of Chemistry, Durham University. Raman spectra were recorded using
a Jobin Yvon Horiba LabRAM spectrometer using Nd:YAG (532 nm) laser
excitation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were carried out
at the G. J. Russell Electron Microscopy facility, Department of Physics,
Durham University. The surface morphology of all the samples was characterized
using SEM, with all images obtained with a Hitachi SU-70 FEG SEM.
The TEM and HRTEM imaging was undertaken using a JEOL 2100F FEG TEM.
The metal content was established using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy.
The samples were provided as homogenized powders and weighed on a
1 mg balance. The samples (93.8 and 26.7 mg) were placed directly
into a Pt 95%/Au 5% crucible. To this, a lithium borate flux was added
until the total weight of each sample and flux was 6.6 g. Claisse
brand high-purity flux was used containing 66.67% Li2B4O7, 32.83% LiBO2, and 5.0% LiI (releasing
agent). The sample and flux were then mixed together using a wooden
stirring implement and placed in a Claisse Le Neo Fluxer using the
“Refractory Materials” fixed conditions. The mixture
was brought to a temperature of 1065 °C and rocked during fluxing.
The total fluxing time was 15 min, and the cooling time was 6 min.
The fused beads were run on a Panalytical Zetium WDXRF with a 4 kW
rhodium anode tube. The samples were analyzed using the Panalytical
proprietary “Wroxi” calibration, and corrections were
made for the variable weight of each sample. The analysis time for
each sample was 340 s.
