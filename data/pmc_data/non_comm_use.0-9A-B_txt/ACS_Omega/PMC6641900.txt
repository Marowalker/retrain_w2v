Bulk
ZrO2 is both nonreducible and nonmagnetic. Recent
experimental results show that dopant-free, oxygen-deficient ZrO2–x nanostructures exhibit a ferromagnetic
behavior at room temperature (RT). Here, we provide a comprehensive
theoretical foundation for the observed RT ferromagnetism of zirconia
nanostructures. ZrO2 nanoparticles containing up to 700
atoms (3 nm) have been studied with the help of density functional
theory. Oxygen vacancies in ZrO2 nanoparticles form more
easily than in bulk zirconia and result
in electrons trapped in 4d levels of low-coordinated Zr ions. Provided
the number of these sites exceeds that of excess electrons, the resulting
ground state is high spin and the ordering is ferromagnetic. The work
provides a general basis to explain magnetism in intrinsically nonmagnetic
oxides without the help of dopants.

1 Introduction
Ferromagnetism
in semiconductor metal oxides finds important applications
in spintronics and optoelectronics.1,2 Many efforts
have been dedicated to the study of ferromagnetism (FM) induced by
transition metal (TM) doping of semiconductor oxides such as ZnO,3,4 TiO2,5−75−7 and ZrO2,8,98,9 also called diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMSs). However, it
remains unclear whether FM is an intrinsic property of the system
or is due to the aggregation of magnetic metal dopants or other magnetic
impurities.10,11 Oxides doped by light 2p elements
(e.g., C- and N-ZnO,12,13 C- and N-TiO2,14,15 N-ZrO2,16 and N-BaTiO317) have been also considered and
predicted as ferromagnets at room temperature (RT), but the origin
of the magnetic behavior is a matter of debate.18−20 In other cases,
staying with the material of interest for this study, tetragonal zirconia,
no ferromagnetism has been observed by doping the oxide with Mn.21

Encouraging results have been recently
obtained for undoped thin
films of TiO2, ZnO, In2O3, and HfO2,22−26 which are FM at RT without any type of dopant element. Also, thin
films of ZrO2 exhibit RT FM. It has been suggested that
this is related to the presence of intrinsic defects. The crystallographic
phase also appears to play a role, with tetragonal ZrO2 that seems to be essential.27−29 In thin films, however, the necessity
to precisely control the nature of the interface with the support
is a critical issue.

For this reason, metal oxide nanoparticles
(NPs) and nanostructures
represent ideal systems to obtain FM at high Curie temperatures (TC > RT).30 Recently,
a FM behavior at RT has been reported for undoped ZrO2 nanostructures.2 The phenomenon has been attributed to the presence
of surface oxygen vacancies (VO). However, there is a conceptual
problem with this hypothesis. A neutral oxygen vacancy in the bulk
and on the surface of zirconia consists of two electrons trapped in
a cavity, with a diamagnetic ground state.31,32 This means that removing oxygen from the bulk or the surface of
zirconia does not necessarily lead to the appearance of magnetic states.

Another problem is the low reducibility of the material. The formation
of VO centers in the bulk or on the surface of ZrO2 is thermodynamically very unfavorable, with vacancy formation
energies of about 6 eV (computed with respect to 1/2 O2).33 In fact, ZrO2 belongs
to the class of nonreducible oxides. However, density functional theory
(DFT) calculations have shown that the cost to remove oxygen in ZrO2 NPs is substantially lower and that the excess electrons
associated with a VO defect can lead in some cases to the
formation of Zr3+ at the position of low-coordinated (LC)
Zr ions.33 This suggests a special role
of nanostructuring in turning the nonreducible ZrO2 into
a reducible material.

But under which conditions the Zr3+ centers can lead
to a FM ordering? Is this ordering stable at RT? What size of NP is
required to reach these conditions? What is the level of reduction
requested? To answer these questions, we have performed an extensive
theoretical investigation of nonstoichiometric ZrO2–x NPs characterized by increasing the size and level
of oxygen deficiency. For the calculations, we have used both DFT
+ U and hybrid (PBE0) functionals. Hybrid functionals, in particular,
are needed to provide a correct description of the electronic structure34 and to accurately reproduce the strength of
the magnetic coupling and of the resulting Curie temperature (TC) of the finite systems.35−37

We show
that the high-spin (HS) FM solution is, beyond a given
size of the NP, the ground state of the system. This work provides
a solid theoretical basis for the observed magnetic behavior of nonstoichiometric
ZrO2 NPs and nanostructures.

2 Results
and Discussion
We model ZrO2–x NPs following
the relative stabilities of the orientation of the lattice planes
in bulk tetragonal zirconia (t-ZrO2). This is analogous
to a Wulff construction at the nanoscale.33,38 In particular, bulk t-ZrO2 was cleaved along the O-terminated
(101) surface, the most stable crystallographic face (see Supporting Information). This structure has also
been observed experimentally for CeO2 NPs, which have similar
characteristics.39 For a discussion on
the stability of oxide nanostructures, see also ref (40). We considered tetragonal
ZrO2 because FM has been observed for this specific polymorph.27−29

We built four nonstoichiometric (oxygen-deficient) octahedral
nanostructures:
Zr44O80, Zr85O160, Zr146O280, and Zr231O448 (see Figure 1). In the smallest
NP, Zr44O80, eight O atoms are missing with
respect to the stoichiometric composition. In the larger particles,
the numbers of missing O atoms are 10, 12, and 14, respectively.

structures of ZrO2 nanoparticles. Red spheres
represent the O atoms, and light blue spheres, Zr atoms.

The size of the NPs goes from 1.4 nm to almost
3.0 nm, which is
the same range as that of synthesized octahedral-based zirconia NPs.41 The NPs are characterized by the presence of
six 4-coordinated Zr corners (Zr4c) and by a size-dependent
number of 6-coordinated Zr edges (Zr6c): from two in Zr44O80 up to five in Zr231O448.

2.1 Nonmagnetic versus Magnetic Ground State
The systems considered in this study are finite in size, and as
such, their electronic structure should be discussed in terms of discrete
levels and molecular orbitals. However, at the sizes considered, bands
start to form; furthermore, the study aims at comparing NPs with the
extended solid (bulk). For these reasons, we will make use of the
language of the band structure to address the electronic structure
of the zirconia NPs. The relative stability of diamagnetic and high-spin
(HS) solutions of ZrO2 NPs has been evaluated by means
of PBE + U exploratory calculations. For the smallest NP considered,
Zr44O80, the ground state is a singlet closed
shell. The lowest HS solution, characterized by 16 unpaired electrons,
lies 1.69 eV higher in energy. In the ground state (singlet), the
excess electrons are localized on the dz2 orbital of the six Zr4c corner ions, which
are reduced from Zr4+(4d0) to Zr2+(4d2) (see Figure 2). This is because the 4d states of the low-coordinated Zr
ions (ZrLC) are lower in energy than those of the fully
coordinated Zr ones and appear as mid-gap states. In Zr44O80, they lie about 1 eV below the conduction band (CB)
(see Figure S2).38 The remaining excess of charge is distributed inside the NP. In
the HS model, the excess electrons are localized on the ZrLC ions at corners and edges, which are reduced from Zr4+(4d0) to Zr3+(4d1). The electron
localization on the Zr ions leads to a remarkable deformation of the
Zr first coordination sphere, corresponding to the formation of a
small polaron. The small number of Zr6c ions along each
edge (only two in Zr44O80) implies a dense distribution
of the unpaired electrons, with a higher cost for the polaronic distortion.
This is the origin of the low stability of the HS state.

Figure 2 (a) Spin densities
of three ZrO2–x NPs in the high-spin
solution; (b) charge density plots of
the excess electrons of the singlet NPs. ρ = 0.01 e–/Å3.

On increasing the NP size, the nature of the ground state
changes.
In the medium-size NP considered, Zr85O160,
there are 20 excess electrons (10 missing O atoms) and the ground
state is HS and FM, with the singlet closed-shell state lying 0.86
eV higher in energy (see Table 1). The order of diamagnetic and magnetic solutions is thus
reversed with respect to the smaller NP. The distribution of the 20
unpaired electrons is similar to that in Zr44O80, but now the ZrLC3+ ions are more uniformly
and homogeneously distributed over the entire surface due to the higher
number of Zr6c sites along the edges (see Table 1). No evidence of clustering
of Zr3+ sites is found. This is an important conclusion.
The switch from the diamagnetic to the magnetic ground state depends
on the ratio between the number of excess electrons and the number
of ZrLC sites available (see Table 1). If ZrLC ≫ n(e–), the magnetic ground state is preferred. In
the absence of a sufficient number of low-lying acceptor levels, in
fact, electrons are forced to doubly occupy these states, leading
to a nonmagnetic ground state.

a PBE + U results.

This interpretation is further corroborated by the results for
the larger Zr146O280 NPs. Here, only the FM
solution is obtained; various attempts to converge on a diamagnetic
state failed because of the intrinsic instability of the singlet closed-shell
state compared to that of the HS one (see Table 1).

To summarize, a larger size of the
ZrO2–x NPs implies that an increase
of the number of ZrLC ions is able to stably trap excess
electrons, favoring a single
occupancy of the Zr 4d levels (Zr3+). The results clearly
show that an O-deficient ZrO2–x NP has a magnetic ground state, at variance with the extended surface
or the bulk of reduced zirconia. The spontaneous magnetization is
thus an intrinsic property of nanostructured, O-deficient zirconia.

2.2 Magnetic Ordering and the Origin of Magnetic
Behavior in Zirconia NPs
To study the existence of RT FM
in ZrO2–x NPs, we have compared
the stabilities of FM and antiferromagnetic (AFM) solutions using
a broken-symmetry solution (the calculations described in what follows
are based on the PBE0 hybrid functional and CRYSTAL14 code; all structures
have been geometrically optimized).

The first-principles AFM
solution has been computed for Zr146O280 starting
from the optimal FM geometry and then fully relaxing the structures
(see Figure 3). However,
the two structures are virtually identical. In Zr146O280, the cost to flip 12 spins, going from 24 up ↑ electrons
(FM) to 12 up ↑ and 12 down ↓ electrons (AFM), is 13.3
meV, confirming that the FM ordering is the ground state (see Table 2).

(a, c) high-spin ferromagnetic (FM) and (b,
d) antiferromagnetic (AFM) solutions of Zr146O280 and Zr231O448 NPs, respectively. Yellow contours

↓ electrons. ρ = 0.01 e–/Å3.

a PBE0 results.

We considered an even larger zirconia NP, Zr231O448 (see Figure 3). Notice
that this particle has nearly 700 atoms and a total of
28 unpaired electrons. For this large NP, the FM state is more stable
than the AFM one by 30.4 meV (see Table 2). The trend is then confirmed: a higher
number of missing O atoms in the NPs leads to a more stable FM state.

The FM coupling can be explained by bound magnetic polaron (BMP)
theory.11,42 The model works for transition metal (TM)
dopants and implies an exchange interaction between shallow electrons
associated with defects and localized d electrons of the TM dopants.
This approach has been reconsidered by taking into account only the
oxygen vacancy (VO) as the defect responsible for the observed
FM in undoped-TiO2 nanoribbons,43 and the polaron considered is associated with oxygen vacancies.
Once the VO concentration reaches a certain limit, an overlap
among the BMPs is established, thus enhancing the FM behavior. However,
it should be mentioned that the model cannot explain the absence of
RT FM in some oxide films, such as monoclinic HfO2 and
ZrO2, characterized by a large number of oxygen vacancies.27

Recently, the charge transfer ferromagnetism
(CTF) model has been
proposed.44 According to this model, the
presence of defects introduces an impurity band below the CB. The
CTF model involves the presence of a charge reservoir that facilitates
the hopping of electrons between the impurity band and the CB, leading
to the splitting of spin states (see the inset of Figure 4).

Figure 4 Projected density of
states of Zr146O280 NP.
The contributions of O (red), Zr4+ 4d0 (blue),
Zr3+ 4d1 corner (black), and Zr3+ 4d1 edge (purple) atoms are reported. The Fermi energy
is set to the highest occupied level. The schematically proposed mechanism
of the FM interaction is due to the hybridization of the Zr3+ states with the CB (composed by Zr4+ 4d and 5s orbitals),
which leads to the splitting of up and down states, as shown in the
inset. A simplified Zr146O280 model with excess
electrons in the FM configuration is also shown.

Here, we propose a model that is a hybrid of these two theories
to explain the FM behavior of undoped ZrO2 and possibly
other oxides.2,43 The model implies the formation
of a BMP among electrons localized on two nearby Zr centers. As shown
in Figure 4, at high
vacancy concentrations, these defects lead to the formation of a band
in the gap just below the CB. The defect states, composed by the Zr
4d1 states, can merge with the CB, leading to a splitting
of up and down spin states that favors the FM ordering. The charge
reservoir is represented by the Zr3+ ions. The stability
of the FM state depends on the hybridization degree between the impurity
band and the CB. Because the nature of the CB in turn depends on the
polymorph and the crystallographic facets involved, this model can
explain the effect of the structure on the FM alignment.

As
reported in Table 2, the FM ordering in Zr146O280 is more stable
than the AFM one by about 13 meV. This means that the AFM state is
not expected to survive at RT because the value of 13.3 meV is well
below the thermal energy (26 meV). In contrast, the higher magnetic
coupling obtained for Zr231O448 (30 meV) suggests
that the ferromagnetism could exist at higher temperatures and could
be stable against thermal fluctuations.45 In fact, increasing the number of BMPs, the total magnetization
and then the TC are also expected to increase.

2.3 Magnetic Coupling in Zirconia NPs
Finally,
we have computed the exchange coupling (Jij) of a pair of isolated Zr ions. This
requires us to compare the stabilities of FM and antiferromagnetic
(AFM) solutions using a broken-symmetry solution (PBE0 results, CRYSTAL14
code). An approximated approach has been adopted. We considered the
stoichiometric Zr40O80 NP, where a LC oxygen
has been removed (Zr40O80-VO) from
one of the most favorable sites (low O vacancy formation energy) to
study with first principles the exchange interaction between just
two magnetic moments. This leaves two electrons that can give a FM
(triplet), an AFM (singlet open shell), or a diamagnetic (singlet
closed shell, S) solution. In the open-shell solutions, one of the
two excess electrons is localized on a Zr4c corner ion
and the other in the vacancy (Figure 5). The singlet closed-shell configuration with electron
localization in the vacancy is favored by the presence of the void
formed in the position of the missing oxygen atom (as for zirconia
surface and bulk). This further shows that the magnetic behavior appears
only in the presence of several vacancies and the related excess of
charge.

Figure 5 Spin density plot of high-spin (a) ferromagnetic and (b) antiferromagnetic
solutions for a Zr40O80 NP with VO at the surface. Yellow represents up ↑ and blue represents
down ↓ electrons. ρ = 0.008 e/Å3.

Then, the exchange coupling (Jij) of two electrons localized
on two low-coordinated Zr atoms
and considered as an isolated pair (ij), Jij = ΔE (AFM – FM), is computed. The FM solution is 1.0 meV more
stable than the AFM one (J = 1.0 meV). Of course,
this value may slightly change if the vacancy is formed in another
position or if it is created in a particle of different size. However,
the final goal of this model is to compute a realistic J value for two magnetic Zr sites with similar environment and separated
by more or less the same average distance observed among magnetic
Zr ions in Zr146O280 and Zr231O448 nanoparticles. From this point of view, we believe that
the J value computed is representative of the magnetic
interaction on larger zirconia reduced nanoparticles. Various FM and
AFM solutions with different geometries have been considered (see Figure S3 and Table S3). It turns out that the
FM state is always lower in energy. The preference for a FM coupling
seems to be an intrinsic property of the system.

To estimate
the Curie temperature, one can use the mean-field approximation
(MFA) and the Heisenberg model, according to the following equation46 1  The MFA method does not deal with the statistical
problem of the local magnetic moments and tends to overestimate TC.47−49 Nevertheless, it has given acceptable
results.49 The J value
is that obtained for a pair of Zr ions as discussed above, 1.0 meV,
and c is the Zr3+ concentration. Although
this is well defined in the bulk of a magnetic solid, it is much more
complex to define on a nanoparticle where the magnetic moments localize
on low-coordinated ions at the surface of the nanoparticle. The value
of TC depends critically on this quantity.
If we define c as the ratio between the number of
Zr3+ ions in the NP and the total number of Zr ions, for
Zr231O448 (c = 28/231 = 0.12),
we estimate a Curie temperature TC = 64
K. If we assume a hypothetical concentration of 2% of Zr3+ ions (c = 0.02), we obtain TC = 387 K. Clearly, it is impossible to provide a quantitative
estimate of TC without knowing the exact
concentration of Zr3+ ions.

3 Conclusions
Bulk ZrO2 is both nonreducible and nonmagnetic. Recent
experimental results show that dopant-free, oxygen-deficient ZrO2–x nanostructures exhibit FM behavior
at RT. We have recently shown that ZrO2 NPs are easy to
reduce via O2 or H2O desorption from low-coordinated
sites.50 In this work, we provide a theoretical
foundation for the observed magnetic character of zirconia nanostructures.

In ZrO2–x NPs, the presence
of low-coordinated Zr ions favors the localization of the excess electrons
originated from the oxygen deficiency in the low-lying Zr 4d levels
(Zr3+). The magnetic Zr3+(4d1) defects
can form only if a sufficient number of ZrLC ions exist.
When this is not the case, the excess of charge is accommodated in
doubly occupied 4d levels, Zr2+(4d2), leading
to an overall diamagnetic ground state. Thus, there is a clear relationship
among the maximum possible level of reduction (number of excess electrons),
the surface area of the NP, and the nature of the ground state (magnetic
or diamagnetic).

If ZrLC sites exceed the number
of excess electrons,
the ground state is high spin and the preferred ordering is ferromagnetic.
Increasing the number of magnetic defects also leads to a stronger
exchange coupling and higher Curie temperatures.

This work provides
a solid theoretical ground to explain the completely
different magnetic behavior of oxygen-deficient nanostructured zirconia
compared to that of the bulk material.

4 Computational
Details
For the study of ZrO2–x NPs,
we used two different approaches. Both are based on the use of codes
that use periodic boundary conditions. A NP is contained in a supercell
and separated by sufficiently large distances from their replicas
in adjacent supercells. The structures of ZrO2–x have been geometrically optimized by means of spin-polarized
DFT calculations with the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP
5.3)51−53 (plane wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff
of 400 eV; core electrons described by the projector-augmented wave
method).54,55 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
for the exchange functional was used within the Perdew, Burke, and
Ernzerhof (PBE) formulation.56 The self-interaction
error of GGA functionals was partly corrected using the PBE + U approach57,58 with the onsite Coulomb correction (Ueff = U – J) for the Zr(4d)
states set to 4 eV.31 Geometry optimizations
of the NP were carried out at the Γ-point, with all atoms free
to relax until the ionic forces become smaller than |0.01| eV/Å
(self-consistency of the electron density set to 10–5 eV).

The magnetic nature of the finite nanoparticles has been
evaluated
with the hybrid DFT functional PBE059,60 using the
CRYSTAL14 code.61 The structures have been
fully optimized at the PBE0 level. Crystalline orbitals are represented
as linear combinations of Bloch functions (BFs). Each BF is built
from linear combinations of Gaussian-type orbitals. An all-electron
basis set has been used for O, 8-411(d1), whereas for Zr, the Hay
and Wadt small-core effective core potential62 associated with a 311(d2) basis set was selected. For the numerical
integration of the exchange-correlation term, 75 radial points and
974 angular points (XLGRID) in a Lebedev scheme in the region of chemical
interest were adopted.

The accuracy of the integral calculations
was increased with respect
to the default value by setting the tolerances to 10, 10, 10, 10,
and 20. The self-consistent field iterative procedure converged to
a tolerance in total energy of ΔE = 1 ×
10–8 au. The threshold for the maximum and the root-mean-square
forces were set to 0.00045 and 0.0003 au, respectively.
