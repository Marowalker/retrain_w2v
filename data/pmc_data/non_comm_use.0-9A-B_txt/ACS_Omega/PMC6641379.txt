We
report capillary force lithography pattern-directed self-assembly
(CFL-PDSA), a facile technique for patterning immiscible polymer blend
films of polystyrene (PS)/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), resulting
in a highly ordered phase-separated morphology. The pattern replication
is achieved by capillary force lithography (CFL), by annealing the film beyond
the glass transition temperature of both the constituent polymers,
while confining it between a patterned cross-linked poly(dimethyl
siloxane) (PDMS) stamp and the silicon substrate. As the pattern replication
takes place because of rise of the polymer meniscus along the confining
stamp walls, higher affinity of PMMA toward the oxide-coated silicon
substrate and of PS toward cross-linked PDMS leads to well-controlled
vertically patterned phase separation of the two constituent polymers
during thermal annealing. Although a perfect negative replica of the
stamp pattern is obtained in all cases, the phase-separated morphology
of the films under pattern confinement is strongly influenced by the
blend composition and annealing time. The phase-separated domains
coarsen with time because of migration of the two components into
specific areas, PS into an elevated mesa region and PMMA toward the
substrate, because of preferential wetting. We show that a well-controlled,
phase-separated morphology is achieved when the blend ratio matches
the volume ratio of the elevated region to the base region in the
patterned films. The proposed top-down imprint patterning of blends
can be easily made roll-to-roll-compatible for industrial adoption.

Introduction
Ever since the development
of soft lithography and embossing-based
patterning techniques specific to soft films in mid-1990s, there has
been tremendous focus on nanopatterning of polymer thin films.1 Nanopatterned films find wide applications in
superhydrophobic surfaces,2 microfluidic
devices,3 structural color,4 flexible electronic devices,5 nanobiotechnology,6 templates for guiding
self-organization, etc.7 Among the various
available techniques,8−10 capillary force lithography (CFL) is a prominent
method, which is capable of creating sub-100 nm features, utilizing
capillary-driven rise of a soften polymer meniscus along the contours
of a soft stamp during pattern replication.10 Ease of implementation without any need of major hardware, possible
use of a flexible stamp that allows easy peeling after pattern formation,
and ability of patterning nonplanar surfaces, etc.12 make CFL superior over other techniques like nano imprint
lithography (NIL), which requires application of high pressure and
is often encompassed with difficulties during detachment of a rigid
mold. To date, films of various types of polymers,1,8−11 as well as inorganic sol gel films, have been very successfully
patterned by CFL and other embossing-based methods, resulting in purely
topographic structures.12

Although
nanopatterned surfaces find wide applications, polymeric
nanostructures with both chemical and topographic features are likely
to result in surfaces with multifunctional capabilities that might
be useful in many emerging technologies. Patterning of a polymer blend
thin film is a viable strategy toward this end, as it is well known
that two immiscible polymers cast from a common solvent phase separate
and form random domains of both the polymers.13−21 The exact morphology of the phase-separated domains depends on multiple
parameters such as the molecular weight of the two phases, their relative
solubility in the common solvent, relative affinity toward the substrate,
film thickness and other coating conditions, relative humidity of
the surrounding, etc.14,15 Polymer blend thin films are
also important from the fundamental standpoint as they act as model
systems for studying and understanding equilibrium and nonequilibrium
properties in statistical physics, such as phase transition, composition
fluctuation, effect of chain conformation, dynamics of the diffusion
process, etc.19 On the other hand, blending
chemically different polymers is a useful approach to optimizing the
properties of industrial products20 and
possible fabrication of functional coatings with exciting properties,
such as antireflection and self-cleaning capability.21 Although the phase-separated domains in a polymer blend
thin film are isotropic, they have been aligned by “bottom-up”
approaches by guiding the phase separation process on a chemically
or topographically patterned substrate where the two constituent phases
migrate to respective surface domains with preferential affinity toward
that particular phase.20−28 However, such ordering requires a prepatterned template.

Careful
review of the published literature reveals that very few
articles have reported direct “top-down” patterning
of a thin polymer blend film,29,30 arguably because of
scientifically intriguing nature of the problem arising out of the
spatial variation in the interaction between the phase-separated domains
of the film and the stamp used for patterning. The presence of multiple
confined interfaces between the two phases with random orientation
leads to complexities during pattern replication. Ding et al. successfully
patterned a polystyrene (PS)/poly(methyl methacrylate) PMMA blend
film by nano imprint lithography, with an applied pressure of 4 MPa
at different temperatures.29 Huck et al.
used NIL to pattern an active polymer blend layer and fabricated photovoltaic
devices with better power conversion efficiencies.30 In contrast, CFL has never been explored for patterning
a polymer blend thin film, despite its wide success in patterning
homopolymer thin films.10,11 As already mentioned,
CFL has several advantages as compared to those of NIL including reduced
accumulation of stresses within the imprinted features and easy implementation
without any dedicated instruments. In this article, we report a new
technique termed as capillary force lithography pattern-directed self-assembly
(CFL-PDSA), which utilizes CFL for patterning PS/PMMA blend thin films
of different compositions. Although an overall perfect negative replica
of the stamp is obtained for all of the blending ratios, the phase-separated
morphology is found to be strongly dependent on the composition of
the film as well as the time given for patterning. The organization
of the phase-separated domains further evolves with progressive thermal
annealing of the film while in conformal contact with the stamp because
of confined capillary dynamics of the molten polymer above the TG of both the phases. We show that under certain
conditions of controlled film thickness, blend composition, and annealing
temperature and time, the blend films exhibit vertical, anisotropic
patterned phase separation as PMMA has stronger affinity toward the
silicon substrate and PS, toward the cross-linked PDMS stamp, resulting
in a vertically phase separated, ordered morphology.

Results and Discussion
As-Cast
Morphology and Temporal Evolution of Unconfined Blend
Films
Films of four different blend compositions; (i) PS
33%/PMMA 67% (designated as S33/M67), (ii) PS 50%/PMMA 50% (S50/M50),
(iii) PS 67%/PMMA 33% (S67/M33), and (iv) PS 75%/PMMA 25% (identified
as S75/M25); were used in our experiments. To understand the dynamics
and alignment of the phase-separated domains in the patterned blend
films via CFL-PDSA, it is important to observe the as-cast morphology
for each blend composition on a flat substrate and also to understand
their evolution with time during thermal annealing. Although there
is wide literature available on the morphology of PS/PMMA blends on
silicon wafers, almost none of them report the morphology of PS/PMMA
blend films prepared by flow coating. The as-cast morphology of a
film with composition S50/M50 is shown as inset A2 of Figure 1A. The morphology comprises
a continuous PMMA matrix layer with isolated PS domains, which is
attributed to preferential wetting of the oxide-coated silicon substrate
by PMMA.33,34 The fractional coverage of PS (AF-PS) in percentage is found to be ≈37.8%.
The as-cast morphology of films with other compositions is shown in Figure S1 of Supporting Information, where it
can be seen that PMMA forms a continuous matrix even in films with
composition S67/M33 because of the enhanced affinity of PMMA toward
the silicon substrate, though the size of the PS domains continuously
grows with an increase in PS fraction. Only in films with composition
S75/M25, the matrix formation of PMMA is suppressed and a bicontinuous
morphology is observed.

all cases is 10 μm.

The morphological evolution of a S50/M50 film after 2 min,
30 min,
and 8 h of thermal annealing at 180 °C is shown in Figure 1A–C, along with respective
solvent-extracted morphologies (Figure 1D–F) after preferential removal of PS. A comparison
between Figure 1A and
inset A shows that the isolated PS domains start to reorganize almost
immediately as thermal annealing starts. With time, the PS domains
start to coalesce, forming larger hemispherical droplets. The size
of the rounded PS domains increases with annealing because of coarsening
until an equilibrium configuration is achieved, which is driven by
minimization of the interfacial area of PS with both PMMA and air.
It can be observed that AF-PS reduces
from 37.8% in Figure 1A to ≈27.8% after 30 min of annealing in Figure 1B, which clearly highlights
that PMMA present in the system preferentially wets the substrate.
Interestingly, AF-PS remains nearly
unaltered during annealing beyond 30 min. As a consequence, the morphologies
of the films shown in Figure 1B,C are nearly identical, including the cross-sectional profiles,
feature height, and spacing of the PS domain (11.76 ± 0.37 and
11.77 ± 0.29 μm in Figure 1B,C respectively). The near-identical morphology clearly
highlights that the domain reorganization as well as morphological
evolution in the films is complete after 30 min of annealing itself.
This pinned state is considered as a long-lived metastable state,
as found in recent simulations of phase separation in capillaries.16,17 The rapid reorganization dynamics of the domains can be attributed
to very low molecular weight of the constituent polymers. This can
be verified in Figure S2 of Supporting
Information, where it can be seen that in a thin film of a symmetric
blend (S50/M50) comprising high-molecular-weight PS (280 K) and PMMA
(350 K) there is virtually no evolution after 8 h of annealing. Only
partial morphological evolution is observed after 24 h of annealing.
Similar coalescence of PS domains is also observed in blend films
of compositions S67/M33 and S33/M67. For S75/M25 blend films with
bicontinuous morphology, the PS threads initially take well-rounded
configuration, before they disintegrate into isolated droplets. With
time, the PS droplets coalesce into larger droplets. The evolution
sequence for films with bicontinuous morphology is shown in Figure S3 of Supporting Information.

Patterning
of the PS/PMMA Blend Films
Whereas a flat
film is in contact only with the substrate, a film during patterning
is confined between the stamp and the substrate and therefore spatio-temporal
reorganization of the phase-separated polymer domains during thermal
annealing is strongly influenced by the wetting behavior of the constituent
polymers on both the stamp and the substrate. Using water, ethylene
glycol, and toluene as a probing liquid in a contact angle goniometer,
the surface energy of the cross-linked Sylgard 182 block is calculated
to be γPDMS = 24.5 mJ/m2.32 The surface energies of PS and PMMA used are γPS = 28.9 mJ/m2 and γPMMA = 29.2
mJ/m2, respectively, both of which are higher than γPDMS. The interfacial tensions of PS and PMMA with cross-linked
PDMS are found to be γPS–PDMS = 5.96 mJ/m2 and γPMMA–PDMS = 8.91 mJ/m2, respectively. The surface and interfacial tension values were calculated
by dispensing water, ethylene glycol, and diodomethane on spin-coated
thin films (roughly 300 nm thick) of PS and PMMA.35 The values of spreading coefficients of PS and PMMA on
PDMS substrates were found to be SPS–PDMS = −10.36 mJ/m2 and SPMMA–PDMS = −13.61 mJ/m2, respectively. Whereas negative
values of both the spreading coefficients indicate that neither PS
nor PMMA would prefer to wet PDMS, a lower value of SPMMA–PDMS as
compared to that of SPS–PDMS implies
that under confinement a PDMS surface would prefer to be in contact
with PS than with PMMA.

Next, we estimate the time needed by
the molten polymer blends to fill the PDMS mold (tfill) from the following equation 1  

where R is the hydraulic
radius, half the channel width (205
nm); η is the polymer zero-shear viscosity; z is the mold depth (140 nm); γ is the surface tension of the
polymer; and θ is the contact angle at the polymer–mold
interface.10 At 180 °C, ηPS = 11.8 Pa s, ηPMMA = 297.7 Pa s, θ
≈ 84°, and corresponding tfill is in the range of 5.2 × 10–4 s (pure PS)
to 0.02 s (pure PMMA), indicating that the mold fill process is extremely
fast.33 However, the calculated value of tfill is based on the assumption that the polymers
are in the molten state. In reality, once the samples are subject
to annealing, there is a finite time requirement for the polymer to
get heated beyond TG and transform to
a molten state. Furthermore, we estimated the maximum height of capillary
rise using the following equation10 2  where
ρ is the density of polymer (approximately
1.1 g/cm3), g is the gravitational constant
(9.81 m/s2), and L is the channel width
full width at half maximum (FWHM) = 410 nm. At 180 °C, hmax is found to be ≈1.55 m. This confirms
that the capillary force is strong enough to fill the polymer into
the mold, as hP is only 140 nm. Finally,
a simple calculation based on the remnant layer thickness ≈30
nm in all cases, it is found that the volume fraction of the elevated
region to the base region in a patterned film is 71:29 for the specific
stamp used for patterning, as can be seen in Figure S4 of Supporting Information.

Figure 2A shows
the AFM image of a patterned S50/M50 blend film after 30 min annealing
at 180 °C. Inset A1 of the figure shows the AFM image of the
stamp used for patterning. Figure 2B shows the superimposed cross-sectional profile of
the patterned film and the stamp used for patterning (inset A1). Inset
A2 of Figure 2A presents
a detailed scaled model of the pattern cross section based on the
actual pattern dimensions obtained from AFM analysis including the
measurement of the thickness of the remnant layer by scratching, which
is found to be ≈30 nm.

the image of the grating-patterned PDMS stamp. (B) Cross-sectional
profiles of the patterned film and PDMS mold exhibiting the perfect
negative replica formation. (C) Optical micrograph of the patterned
blend film. The scale bar corresponds to 20 μm.

It is important to highlight that for a specific
stamp the thickness
of the remnant layer depends on dinitial, which was kept constant at ≈100 nm for films with all different
compositions. Both the stamp and the patterned film have λP = 750 nm and FWHM of the height region peak is 410 nm, which
confirms that a perfect negative replica of the stamp pattern forms
on the blend film, with no loss of fidelity during pattern transfer
by CFL. The optical micrograph in Figure 2C shows that uniform pattern replication
has taken place over a large area of the patterned S50/M50 film, which
confirms the large area of the film surface.

Identical pattern
replication was also observed in blend films
with other compositions as well (refer to Figure S5 of Supporting Information) for annealing times of 30 min
and above. Interestingly, the large-area optical microscope images
of the patterned films, both after 30 min and 8 h of annealing, show
no signs of phase separation at all, which is always observed in flat
thin films of immiscible blends, such as PS/PMMA, and is shown in Figure 1. Even in the only
earlier article on nano imprinting of PS/PMMA blend thin films by
Ding et al., signatures of phase separation on the patterned films
over large areas was observed.29 The disappearance
of the phase-separated domain boundaries in Figures 2 and S5 is attributed
to flow-driven reorganization of low-molecular-weight PS and PMMA
under a confining stamp, clearly highlighting the effectiveness of
CFL in patterning a polymer blend film over NIL, particularly in terms
of pattern uniformity control. In certain cases, the patterns obtained
after 2 min annealing exhibit incomplete replication with signs of
phase-separated domains. This is due to the finite time required by
the polymers to transform into the molten state under actual experimental
conditions.

Evolution of Phase-Separated Morphology of
Patterned Films
In Figure 3, we
show the morphology of the PMMA domains after selective extraction
of the PS phase, in films annealed for 2 min (column 1), 30 min (column
2), and 8 h (column 3). The main frames of Figure 3 show the solvent-extracted morphology (after
preferential removal of PS) of the patterned films with different
compositions: S33/M67 (series A); S50/M50 (series B); S67/M33 (series
C), and S75/M25 (series D). The insets to the first and second images
in each series show the morphology of the patterned film before selective
removal of PS. The images illustrate how the PS and PMMA domains reorganize
with time under the confining stamp. Column 4 shows the cross-sectional
profiles of the samples shown in column 4, and column 5 schematically
represents the organization of the phase-separated domains in the
patterned films after 8 h of annealing (the images are not to scale).

Figure 3 AFM images
of patterned PS/PMMA blend films with varying compositions
and annealing times after the extraction of the PS phase. The compositions
are S33/M67 (series A), S50/M50 (series B), S67/M33 (series C), and
S75/M25 (series D). The patterning times used are 2 min (A1–D1),
30 min (A2–D2), and 8 h (A3–D3). The insets show the
images of patterned films before PS phase extraction. (A4–D4)

(A5–D5) Schematic showing the composite architecture of individual
stripes in each case.

The first image in each series shows that the patterns start
to
appear just after 2 min of annealing, though some signatures of the
initial phase-separated domains are still present. By 30 min of annealing,
a perfect negative replica of the stamp patterns was obtained on the
film surface for each blend composition (the inset to the second figure
in each series of Figure 3). This happens due to very short mold filling time (5.2 ×
10–4 s > tfill >
0.02
s) as well as very shallow depth of the stamp used for patterning
(140 nm). However, in many cases, the phase-separated domains are
seen to further reorganize beyond 30 min, without affecting the overall
replicated pattern morphology. This means that the morphological evolution
in a film confined between a stamp and the substrate during patterning
is slower than that in a flat film, as we have seen in Figure 1 that the morphological evolution
as well as domain reorganization in a flat film is complete within
30 min. We argue that the additional shear resistance to flow at the
film–stamp interface is responsible for sluggish domain reorganization
in a film sandwiched and confined between two rigid substrates as
compared to that in a flat unconfined film, which has a zero-shear
air–film interface.

Figure 3 highlights
that with progressive annealing the PMMA phase starts to migrate toward
the substrate because of its strong affinity to the SiOx surface, irrespective of the blend composition.
This in turn results in migration of PS present in the films toward
the stamp, as it maximizes the contact area of the PDMS stamp with
PS, which is obvious from the values of spreading coefficients reported
earlier. Furthermore, within the grooves, both the PMMA phase and
PS phase coalesce with their neighboring PMMA phase and PS phase,
respectively, and subsequently get packed along the replicated stripes.
In films with compositions S67/M33 and S75/M25, the PS domains coalesce
and accumulate under the entire stamp grooves to form PS threads spanning
the grooves over the PMMA layer, as has been schematically shown in Figure 3C5,D5, respectively.
Interestingly, in both the cases, the PS fraction is very close to
71%, which is the volume fraction of a patterned film that lies within
the grooves. As the PS fraction is just below 71% in the S67/M33 film,
the PMMA layer forms a very shallow arch below every PS thread (Figure 3C3 and cross section
in Figure 3C4). In
contrast, a higher PS fraction in a S75/M25 film leads to a concave
curvature of the PMMA meniscus at the PS–PMMA interface below
each stripe (Figure 3D3,D4). PMMA forms a tiny ridge along the edge of the stamp grooves
arguably due to pinning. At both the compositions, we can argue that
perfect vertical phase separation between PS and PMMA has been achieved,
resulting in the formation of aligned isolated PS threads over a continuous
PMMA underlayer.

In contrast, in films with low PS fraction
(S33/M67 and S50/M50),
PS fails to cover the entire span of the stamp groove because of the
inadequate amount of PS present in the films. Consequently, PMMA is
also present in the protruded areas of the patterned film, under the
stamp grooves. It can be seen from Figure 3A3,B3 that with a decrease in PS fraction,
the PMMA domains within the replicated stripes become progressively
larger. Figure 3B2
shows an interesting intermediate morphology, where PS and PMMA threads
laterally coexist along each replicated stripe after 30 min of annealing.
However, with time, the tiny PS threads break down in favor of alternating
PS and PMMA domains along the stripes. Vertical scale bars of ≈140
nm in both Figure 3A3,B3 imply that the PMMA domains span the depth of the stamp grooves.
This reorganization is probably attributed to minimization of the
PS–PMMA interfacial area within the grooves. The estimated
volume fraction of PMMA within the elevated regions of the patterned
films as a function of blend composition and annealing time is shown
in Figure 4. The figure
clearly highlights the gradual migration of PMMA from the stripes
to the base of the film with progressive annealing and also near-complete
stratification of PS within the grooves and PMMA over the entire base
in PS-rich films.

Figure 4 Estimated ratio of the volume of PMMA in the elevated region
(VPMMA) to the volume of the elevated
region (Ve) in films annealed for 2 min
(black square), 30 min (red circle), and 8 h (blue triangle) as a
function of the (A) volume fraction of PS (ϕPS) and
(B) annealing time.

Finally, we would like
to demonstrate one specific application
of the patterned blend thin films, particularly the ones with ordered
vertical phase separation (shown in Figure 3C3,D3) where strips of PS are formed over
a continuous matrix or remnant layer of PMMA. We demonstrate that
the ordered PS strips are elegantly used as a self-organized mask
to etch the exposed portion of the PMMA remnant layer below it. This
is achieved by simple UVO exposure of the patterned blend films. It
is well known that UVO exposure preferentially degrades PMMA as compared
with PS.36 Thus, when the patterned film
is exposed to UVO in a UV–ozone chamber (Novascan Technologies),
the thickness of the PMMA film between the PS strips gradually reduces
with time, resulting in a grating structure that has a higher feature
height than that of the original stamp. Figure 5 shows the morphology of such a grating where
the stripe height is 158 nm obtained after 25 min of UVO of a patterned
S75/M25 blend film. It may be recalled that the height of the stamp
features is 140 nm, which can be seen in the superimposed cross-sectional
profile. Thus, patterning of blend thin films with vertical phase separation, in conjugation with UVO
exposure, can be used as a simple method for creating nanopatterns,
which are taller than the original stamp patterns and cannot be created
by any direct embossing technique, and is considered to be a scientific
challenge which is only partially resolved.37

Conclusions
We have utilized capillary force lithography
pattern-directed self-assembly
to fabricate topographically uniform patterns on phase-separated polymer
blend thin films. We show that a perfect negative replica of the stamp
pattern can be obtained on blends of any composition after 30 min
of annealing. However, the phase-separated domains continue to evolve
and reorganize with progressive annealing without altering the overall
patterned morphology when the films are annealed beyond 30 min. During
this stage, preferential migration of PMMA toward the substrate coupled
with coalescence of individual PS and PMMA domains leads to a well-ordered
phase-separated morphology. Of particular interest is the vertical
phase separation in PS-rich films, where PS accumulates entirely along
the stamp grooves, forming PS threads over a continuous PMMA layer.
This is the first example of the formation of such well-controlled
phase-separated structures due to vertical phase separation in a polymer
blend thin film, confined between a stamp and the substrate. On the
other hand, alternating PMMA and PS domains are arranged along each
replicated stripe in films with a high PMMA fraction. This capillary
force lithography pattern-directed self-assembly (CFL-PDSA) has much
potential for a wide range of vertical patterning of a large range
of polymer blend films ubiquitously used in the thin film industry.
The patterns are extremely reproducible and span over large areas
(cm2). The proposed method is facile, easy to implement
without the need of any major lithography or fabrication facility,
and highlights the possibility of fabricating polymeric nanostructures
with both chemical and topographic features, which are likely to find
application as surfaces with multifunctional capabilities that might
be useful in many emerging nanotechnologies.

Materials and Methods
Material
Polystyrene (PS, weight-average molecular
weight, Mw = 16 400 g/mol; polydispersity
index, PDI = 1.16; Polymer Source Inc.) and poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA, Mw = 15 000 g/mol; PDI =
1.12; Polymer Source Inc.) were used as received. TG values for PS and PMMA are 95 and 101 °C, respectively.
Poly(dimethyl siloxane), PDMS, Sylgard 182, was purchased from Dow
Corning. p-Type silicon substrates were bought from Silicon Quest
International, Inc., and digital versatile disc (DVD) was purchased
from Sony Corporation, Japan. For some control experiments, PS with Mw 280 kg/mol and PMMA with Mw 350 kg/mol (Sigma) were also used.

Preparation
of Stamp for Patterning
The stamp for patterning
the blend films was created by replica molding the structures present
on the surface of a commercial DVD on a self-standing block of Sylgard
182 (cross-linked PDMS). For this purpose, the polycarbonate layer
of DVD was separated and the metallic reflecting layer on the surface
of DVD pattern was removed by scotch tape, followed by rinsing in
acetone, as has been described in detail elsewhere.31 The liquid PDMS and curing agent were thoroughly mixed
in the weight ratio of 10:1, and the mixture was degassed to remove
the entrapped air bubbles. The PDMS prepolymer mixture was then poured
onto the DVD master and was cured at 120 °C for 4 h for complete
cross-linking. The patterned cross-linked Sylgard stamps were subsequently
manually peeled from the DVD master. The stamps had grating geometry,
with pattern periodicity (λP) = 750 nm, stripe height
(hP) = 140 nm, duty ratio = 1, and FWHM
of the height region peak around 410 nm.

Blend Thin Film Preparation
The concentration of the
casting solution was maintained at 3% polymer in toluene (w/v) for
all different blend compositions. Before coating the films, silicon
substrates were rinsed with toluene, followed by 1 h ultraviolet–ozone
treatment. Then, PS/PMMA blend films were flow-coated from prepared
PS/PMMA blend solutions onto the UVO-treated silicon substrate. The
gap and speed of flow coater were adjusted to obtain the predetermined
initial film thickness (dinitial) of 100
nm. The film thickness after coating was measured by an interferometer.
Prior to the thermal annealing process, the residual solvent was extracted
by placing the films in an oven at 50 °C for 6 h under vacuum.

Patterning of the Blend Films
The blend films were
patterned by a low-pressure-assisted CFL.11 The patterned cross-linked PDMS stamp was first brought in contact
with the blend films and was subject to a uniform load of 4 kPa to
ensure complete conformal contact between the stamp and the film surface.
The films sandwiched between the substrate and the stamp were then
subjected to annealing in an oven at 180 °C under vacuum. We
report the morphology of the patterned films after 2 min, 30 min,
and 8 h of annealing.

Selective Solvent Extraction
To
study the morphology
of the phase-separated domains, PS was extracted by immersing the
films in cyclohexane for 30 min at 22 °C, followed by drying
in a stream of dry nitrogen. In certain cases, the PMMA layer was
also degraded by UVO exposure.

Characterization
The surface topography of the films
(as-cast, patterned, and solvent-extracted) were investigated using
an atomic force microscope (AFM, Dimension ICON, Veeco at Akron and
5100, Agilent Technologies at Kharagpur) in intermittent contact mode.
To measure the thickness of the residual layers and absolute height
of the pattern, the scratch test was performed using a sharp blade,
followed by measuring the height difference between the silicon substrate
and the film surface.
