A novel porous polymer–inorganic
hybrid biocomposite with
various functional groups (hide substance/chitosan/hydroxyapatite)
has been synthesized in simple, economic, and scalable process utilizing
leather industry solid waste and seafood industry waste composed with
hydroxyapatite. Physicochemical characterization of the material reveals
formation of composites with homogenous distribution of the constituents
in the material matrix. The composite is hard and porous (with 0.1632
cm3/g slit-shaped mesopores and micropores) having particle
sizes 40–80 μm and a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface area of 55.54 m2/g. The material is polycrystalline
in nature with a fair amount of amorphous substance and less hydrophilic
in character than constituent polymers. The dye removal efficiency
of the material has been tested with two model dyes, namely, methylene
blue (MB) (cationic/basic dye) and sunset yellow (SY) (anionic/acid
dye). Optimum adsorptions of 3.8 mg MB (pH 12, RT ≈ 27 °C)
and 168 mg of SY (pH 3, RT ≈ 27 °C) have been found per
gram of the composite material. Langmuir isotherm and pseudo second
order rate models have been found to be the best-fit models to explain
the equilibrium isotherm and kinetics of the adsorption process for
both the dyes. However, higher and faster adsorption of SY in comparison
with MB indicated higher binding efficiency of the material toward
the acidic dye. Desorption of dyes from the dye-adsorbed material
was studied using a suitable eluent of appropriate pH and recycling
for five times showed without loss of efficiency. The prepared composite
showed very high dye removal efficiency toward four different commercially
used dyes (496 mg/g of Orange-NR, 477 mg/g of Red-VLN, 488 mg/g of
Blue-113 dye, and 274 mg/g of Green-PbS dye) from their individual
and cocktail solutions. It was also efficient to decolorize dye-bearing
tannery exhaust bath. Hence, waste materials generated during industrial
processes could be efficiently used for the decontamination of colored
wastewater produced by various industries.

1 Introduction
Pollution
is a vital issue associated with rapid industrialization,
urbanization, and rise in the living standard of civilization. Generation
of waste and release of toxic materials are the consequences of ongoing
unmanaged developments. Therefore, intelligent efforts are mandatory
to prevent environmental deterioration through innovative sustainable
avenues.1,2 The leather processing industry has a worldwide
negative image because of its pollution potential.3 Processing of every 1000 kg of hide generates ∼750–800
kg of solid waste, most of which are collagenous materials.4 On the other hand, seafood industries generate
a substantial amount of crustacean waste, where chitinous material
is the prime constituent.5 To avoid serious
pollution hazards, both of these wastes are required to be utilized
properly. Collagen is composed of triple helical polypeptide chains;
each of the chains contains amino, carboxyl, and other hydrophilic
and hydrophobic functionalities. Chitosan (Cs) is the most (>75%)
deacetylated form of chitin. Presence of amine group and primary and
secondary hydroxyl groups makes this biopolymer highly reactive. Hence,
both of these highly functional materials are capable to form chemical
adducts with various chemicals and biochemicals in several ways, such
as forming co-ordinate and covalent bonds, ionic interactions, hydrogen
bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and so forth. Moreover, both of
these materials are biocompatible, as well as biodegradable and inexpensively
available in abundant quantities. Therefore, a suitable, inexpensive
biocomposite material having multiple functionalities could be developed
for sustainable multipurpose applications by manipulating their physical
forms and/or chemical functionalities.

Colored wastewater released
by various industries, namely, textile,
pharmaceutical, food processing, tannery and various chemical industries,
has also been considered to be a fatal hazard to the environment.
Most of these dyes used by industries are of synthetic origin and
are usually stable and difficult to remove by conventional water treatment
processes, for example, flocculation, coagulation, chemical precipitation,
membrane separation, chemical and biological oxidation, phyto-extraction,
ion-exchange, and so forth. Adsorption in this context has been established
as the most efficient, eco-friendly, simple, flexible, and cost-effective
technique for the treatment of dye-bearing wastewater.3−10 In this context, a sustainable adsorbent should be efficient, reusable,
inexpensive, abundantly available, biocompatible, and biodegradable.
However, though activated charcoal has been the most applied adsorbent,
high capital investment and processing cost have prompted an increased
research interest toward the development of relatively cheaper and
effective alternatives to activated charcoal.3 Recently, various approaches have been considered, which include
application of natural materials, biosorbents, and waste materials
resulting from industries and agriculture. Cs and collagenous material
both have significant potential to be an effective adsorbent.4−6,11−14 However, low mechanical strength
of these soft polymeric materials could be the prime disadvantage
for their large-scale water treatment applications. Hence, it is essential
to improve their mechanical properties without sacrificing their adsorption
efficiency and biocompatibility.5

Some of the recent studies indicated that hydroxyapatite (HAp)
could be effectively used as an adsorbent for the removal of various
toxicants from water.15,16 It is an inorganic biocompatible
material, extensively used for hard tissue (bone) regeneration, and
could be prepared by simple inexpensive techniques. However, low stability
and significant pressure drop during filtration because of its low
particle size limit its application in field studies. Hence, it is
expected that combination of HAp with hide substance (Hs) and Cs should
compensate for the drawback of individual materials and may develop
a sustainable adsorbent for large-scale application. In practical
sense, waste generated by some industries could be effectively employed
for the treatment of toxic effluents generated by other industries.1,5−7,11−14

In the present study, we have synthesized and characterized
a novel
biocompatible bio-inorganic composite material (Hs–Cs–HAp)
using Hs from tannery collagenous solid waste, Cs from seafood industry
waste, and HAp by a simple, green, and economical process and further
examined its efficiency, physicochemical adsorption characteristics,
and reusability toward the removal of two different model dyes, namely,
methylene blue (MB) (cationic/basic dye) and sunset yellow (SY) (anionic/acid
dye). Additionally, to evaluate its practical application potential,
we have tested its efficiency toward the removal of four different
commercial dyes (primarily used in leather and textile industries)
from their synthetic waste liquor and a dye-bearing tannery wastewater
collected from a local leather processing unit.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 General Characterization
The chemical
characteristics of the synthesized polymer–inorganic biocomposite
have been evaluated from the solid-state (SS) NMR and Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra. The 13C and 15N SSNMR
spectra of the composites along with native polymers are presented
in Figures S1 and S2. Signals of carbons related to all the constituted amino acids of
Hs17 and saccharide framework of Cs18 were distinctly visible in the spectra of the
composite materials. Similar observations were also noticed in the 15N-SSNMR spectra. However, the observed broadening of the
nitrogen signals in the Hs–Cs–HAp as compared to the
native polymers resulted from the alteration of the intra polymeric
H-bonds and the formation of new interpolymeric H-bonds during the
composite formation. In addition, the 31P signal of PO43– (δ = 2.53 ppm) of HAp only appeared
in the SS 31P NMR spectrum of the composite (Figure S3), which supported the existence of
both the native polymer in their molecular form in the composite along
with HAp. The FTIR spectra of the composite along with the native
polymeric components and HAp are presented in Figure S4. Hs is mainly composed of collagen along with some
minor proteins, and the Cs is 2-amino polysaccharide. Hence, both
of the polymers contain plenty of primary and secondary amine and
hydroxyl groups, which are reflected as strong and broad merging peaks
at the 3000–3700 cm–1 region of their FTIR
spectra. The C–H stretching signals of both the organic polymers
have appeared in the region 2850–3000 cm–1. Characteristics amide-I (C=O stretching) and amide-II (C–N
stretching and N–H bending) of proteinaceous Hs have appeared
at 1660 and 1550 cm–1, and the corresponding Amide-III
signal was observed at ±1235 cm–1. The C=O
stretching vibration of acetylated group of some (∼20%) of
amine units of Cs have appeared at 1637 cm–1, and
the characteristic saccharide signals of Cs have appeared in the 1050–1150
cm–1 region. In the spectra of composite material,
the highly intense and broad peaks at 1000–1050 cm–1 have appeared because of the stretching of the PO43– signals of HAp; alongside the corresponding bending
of the PO43– signals have appeared at
565 and 605 cm–1 as appeared in the individual FTIR
spectra of HAp. However, the peak of CO32– (mild amount of CaCO3 formed during the formation of
HAp) and bending vibration of adsorbed water at 1643 cm–1 of native HAp are not separately distinguishable in the spectra
of composite because of merging with other peaks of the polymers.19 The distinguished features of the spectral pattern
of the composite have appeared in the 1500–1700 cm–1 region. The amide-I signals of Hs shifted toward lower frequency
and the amide-II signal shifted toward higher frequency, consequently
both of them merged with the C=O signals of acetylated amine
signals of Cs to form a single broad merging peak at 1650 cm–1. Such shifting of peaks together with variation in relative signals
intensities took place due to complex intercomponent interaction between
the polar head groups such as −COOH, −OH, −NH2 of the constituent polymers through the hydrogen bond in
conjunction with the chelating interaction with Ca2+ and
PO43– of the inorganic HAp.

In
the X-ray powder diffraction patterns of composite (Figure 1), the presence of strong sharp
signal centered at 2θ: 32° (30°–35°),
medium intensity signal at 26° and other minor signals at 2θ:
40, 46.6, 49.5, and 53.1° are the characteristics of HAp corresponding
reflections at (211), (002), (310), (222), (213), and (004) planes.20−22 Related d-spacing of crystal lattices are specified
in Figure 1. However,
broad nature of the most of these reflections indicated that HAp in
the composite was poorly crystallized. Other crystalline phase appeared
at 2θ: 20° (100 plane of Cs), which was found to be significantly
weak in the synthesized material compared to the native Cs indicating
that the ordered chain alignment of the native Cs has been considerably
disrupted through the inter polymeric interaction, making the HAp
to form a new material matrix.

Figure 1 XRD of the composite (Hs–Cs–HAp).

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) spectra of the composite
(Hs–Cs–HAp) and the native HAp are presented in Figures S5 and S6,
respectively. The results of the XPS survey scan reveal the elemental
composition of each material; Ca, P, and O of native HAp, whereas
C, N, O, Ca, and P, are the constituents of the derived composite.
However, high resolution scan for each element reveals the insight
of the material properties as well as surface functionalities of each
solid. The Ca 2p peak of HAp was appeared at ∼342–352
eV as a doublet. The corresponding splitting of the Ca 2p peak (Ca
p3/2, 346.2 eV; Ca p1/2, 349.6 eV) with 3.5
eV energy separation resulted due to spin–orbit coupling, indicating
typical +2 oxidation state of Ca.19 This
peak appeared identically in case of Hs–Cs–HAp, indicating
similar chemical environment of Ca in both the solids. Similar observation
was also observed for both the samples in the case of P 2p signals
of phosphorous representing the P–O bond of PO43– of HAp. The P 2p signals
in both samples appeared as a doublet 133.3 eV (P 2p3/2) and 134.2 eV (P 2p1/2) due to the spin–orbit
interaction, and peaks were separated by usual 0.9 eV. The de-convoluted
O 1s spectrum of the HAp indicates that oxygen is present in the native
HAp in two different chemical environments. The main peak centered
at ∼530 eV has appeared due to the presence of −OH group of HAp, whereas a tiny peak centered at ∼532.3
eV is attributed to the O–P and O–Ca bond. The O–H bond of bound moisture
(if any) also appeared at the same place.19 However, the nature of O 1s XPS spectrum of the Hs–Cs–HAp
is markedly different than the same of the native HAp. The main broad
peak centered at ∼530 eV attributed to the combined peaks of
hydroxyl (−OH) group of Hs, Cs, HAp, and oxygen
of different carbonyl, carboxylic, and ether groups (C=O, O–C=O, O–C–O), O–P, and O–Ca bonds. Other tiny peaks at lower binding energies
[BE(s)] are resulted due to the presence of some differently positioned
biopolymeric oxygenated functionalities.19 C 1s spectrum of Hs–Cs–HAp represents the characteristics
features of the constituent polymers. Peak centered at 285.5 eV represents
the C–C/H bond of the polymeric backbones. Fitted
peak centered at 289 eV represents C–O/N bonds
of the polymeric functional groups. The signals of carbons of carboxylic
and amide functionalities of the constituent polymers are observed
at 290.8 eV.19,23 However, in spite of the absence
of carbon in the chemical compositions in native HAp, a very tiny
peak of carbon appeared in the XPS scan of native HAp, which was due
to the formation of minute amount of CaCO3 during formation
of HAp.19 N 1s XPS spectrum also represents
the characteristics signals of the polymer matrix. Small peak at BE
395.9 eV represents primary and secondary nonprotonated amine group
of the polymer constituents, whereas main peak centered at 399.7 eV
attributed to the nitrogen of amide group and cationic (protonated)
amines functionalities.

Surface morphology and microstructural
analysis of the composite
were analyzed by optical (low resolution) and scanning electron microscopy
techniques (Figure 2a,b). The results indicated that the material was typically hard
polymeric in nature, and the particle size varied within 40–80
μm; the surface of the particles was rough and possessed a fair
amount of porosity. No separate either polymeric or inorganic aggregates
were observed throughout the composite, indicating homogenous dispersion
of each component within the material matrix. The related energy-dispersive
X-ray spectrometry (EDXS) analysis (Figure S7) indicated the presence of C, N, O, P, Na, and Ca as expected from
the composition of each constituent. Related elemental mapping has
indicated homogenous distributions of all the elements confirming
uniform distribution of the material components throughout the composites.
To observe the material characteristics beyond the general morphology,
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis
of the material surface was performed. A typical rodlike crystalline
aggregate (Figure 2c) constituting mainly Ca, P, O, and Na (EDXS spectra presented in Figure S8) was widely distributed throughout
the composites (noticed at 100 nm magnification level). These were
actually distributed crystalline HAp structures in and around the
polymeric network.24,25 The selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) pattern (Figure 2d) of this crystalline structure revealed typical polycrystalline
nature of these aggregates.25,26 Different orientation
patterns of the HAp crystal network responsible for polycrystallinity
of the material, which were clearly visible at 10 nm magnification
level (Figure 2e).
Further magnification at 5 nm level, unit cells of HAps crystalline
structures became distinctly visible (Figure 2f).27,28 The synthesis of the
Hs–Cs–HAp and the intercomponent interaction within
the material matrix are presented schematically in Figure 3.

The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
N2 adsorption/desorption
isotherm provided information about the effective surface area of
the material along with prevailing porous networks of the material.
Nature of the N2 adsorption/desorption curves resulted
from the experimentation (Figure 4a) resembled with type-IV BET isotherm with H3 hysteresis
loop, indicating the presence of mesopores in the composites having
slitlike pore structures.27 However, the
presence of micropores (pore diameter <2 nm) in the material was
not detected. The BET surface area of the material was found to be
55.54 mm2/g, and av. total pore volume was found to be
0.1632 cm3/g and av. pore diameter of 11.75 nm [derived
from the desorption batch of Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) isotherm; presented in the inset of Figure 4a]. As this N2-based BET method
is not able to analyze the presence of macropores (pore diameter >50
nm) in the material, and the Hg infusion study was done to analyze
the macroporous structure of the materials. The results (Figure 4b) indicate that
apart from the mesopores material also possess a fair amount of pores
in 0–130 μm size range.

isotherm and BJH pore structure
analysis (inset), (b) mercury porosity meter analysis.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the composite
along with native
polymers is presented in Figure 5. Initial weight (wt) loss for all the samples from
RT to 150 °C was due to evaporation of bound water as both the
constituent polymers are hydrophilic in nature. Considerably low wt
loss (only 15%) of the composite with respect to native polymers (Hs:
33%; Cs: 24%) indicates that developed composites were far less hydrophilic
in nature due to incorporation of inorganic component. The second
and most rapid wt loss of the native polymers started at 260 °C
for Hs and 275 °C for Cs; these stages continued up to 320 °C
for Hs and 380 °C for Cs. Wt loss at that stage (Hs: 34%; Cs:
36%) was due to protein structure denaturation and gelatinization
followed by the first stage of degradation.22,29,30 Release of H2O, NH3, CO, CO2, and CH3COOH followed by decomposition
of pyranose structure took place in the case of Cs.31,32 The third and final wt loss of native polymers was observed at 315–450
°C for Hs and 380–600 °C for Cs; wt loss at that
stage (Hs: 33%; Cs: 40%) of the polymers was attributed to complete
destruction of the organic frame work. Release of different cyclo-peptides,
pyrroles, indoles, pyrimidines, nitriles and anhydrides, and so forth
from the collagenous materials of Hs was reported.22,29,30 Considerable amount of CH4 release
apart from different pyrazines, pyridines, pyrroles, and furan were
also detected at the final stage of Cs degradation.31,32 In case of composite (Hs–Cs–HAp), after the initial
loss of wt due to release of adsorbed water, major wt loss was noted
in the temperature range 260–315 °C (stage-II, 13%, sharp),
followed by 315–500 °C (stage-III, 23%). Wt losses at
these stages were due to denaturation followed by decomposition and
combustion of the organic portions. Interestingly, considerable slow
wt loss of the composite at stage-III clearly indicated the formation
of strong inorganic–polymeric network (matrix), which hindered
the thermal decomposition of the polymeric component. Above 500 °C,
only 9% (very slow) loss of wt was observed up to 700 °C, and
this might be attributed to the combustion of the remaining organic
materials along with decomposition of the carbonate generated during
HAp formation by the interaction with air. Above 700 °C, the
wt of the material remained constant. The residual wt (40%) belonged
to the inorganic part of the composite.

along with native polymers.

2.2 Adsorption with Model Dyes (MB and SY)
2.2.1 Effect of pH and Temperature
Effects
of the initial pH (2–13) and temperature on the adsorption
of the model dyes MB and SY from aqueous solution by the Hs–Cs–HAp
composites were investigated, and the results are presented in Figure S9. Maximum adsorption of MB at pH 12.0
and minimum in acidic pH was observed, whereas SY showed maximum adsorption
at pH 3.0, and its adsorption of SY decreased rapidly with increasing
pH: eventually, it showed almost zero adsorption at basic pH. As the
ionic interaction was one of the prime mechanisms (impact of hydrogen
bonding and electron dispersion in π-cloud might also influence
the adsorption process depending upon the chemical nature and structure
of the dye molecules) of dye adsorption by the native polymers comprising
the composite Hs–Cs–HAp (hydrogen bonding and electron
dispersion in π-cloud might also influence the process depending
upon the chemical nature and structure of the dye molecules), the
resulted pH effect on MB and SY adsorption was also expected. The
Hs−Cs−HAp primarily consists of collagenous Hs and Cs;
both are cationic polymers, and hence, they acquire highly positive
surface charge at the acidic pH (due to spontaneous protonation) and
marginally negative charge at the basic pH (due to binding of OH–). Therefore, the cationic dye MB became adsorbed by
the material at the basic pH, and the anionic SY dye adsorbed much
at the acidic pH. It was found that the composite was quite stable
in a wide pH range and hence favorably applicable to wastewater treatment.

Effect of temperature on the dye adsorption process has been reported
also in Figure S9. The results indicated
that maximum adsorption of both the dyes occurred at 27 ± 2 °C.
Thus, at pH 12, 27 °C, and pH 3, 27 °C, were found optimum
adsorption conditions for MB and SY, respectively, for Hs–Cs–HAp;
further adsorption experiments were done at the above optimum conditions.

2.2.2 Equilibrium Isotherm
The adsorption
isotherm provides information about the nature of adsorbate–adsorbent
interaction at equilibrium. This information is essential for the
large-scale application of the process. The experimental adsorption
data of the dyes, MB and SY, were fitted to the linear forms of Langmuir
and Freundlich isotherms6−8 (eqs 1 and 2) and are illustrated in Figure S10. Corresponding nonlinear curve fitting
of experimental data of each isotherm plots and related general experimental
equilibrium isotherm data are presented in Figure 6a,b along with isotherm constants and correlation
coefficient value (inset) for each dyes. 1   2  where Ce represents
the equilibrium dye concentration in the solution (mg/L), qe is the dye adsorbed (mg/g) by the adsorbent
at equilibrium, aL and KL are the Langmuir constants; KF is the Freundlich constant, and 1/n is the heterogenity
factor. Therefore, a plot of Ce/qe against Ce will
give a straight line with a slope aL/KL and intercept 1/KL, where 1/slope, that is, (KL/aL) represents the monolayer saturation capacity
(Qmax).

Figure 6 General and predicted Langmuir and Freundlich
isotherm plots of
(a) (a) Hs−Cs−HAp−MB and (b) Hs–Cs–HAp–SY
adsorption systems.

The Langmuir isotherm
model gave a better fit (correlation coefficient, R2 > 0.99) to the experimental data in comparison
with the Freundlich isotherm model for the adsorption of both the
dyes (MB and SY). Additionally, the dependence of dimension less separation
factor (RL) [RL = 1/(1 + aLC0)] with the range of concentration studied (MB: 5–30 mg/L,
SY: 50–500 mg/L) was calculated using the Langmuir constant
(aL) values, which was found to be 0 > RL ≫ 1 (Figure S11) for both the dyes, indicating the process to be favorable and irreversible
in nature.5,6 The Langmuir model of isotherm was almost
ideally followed by both the dyes, and hence, they formed monolayer
on the composite (Hs–Cs–HAp) surface occurred by forming
a monolayer by direct interaction with the uniformly distributed energetically
equivalent specific adsorption sites (chemisorption) on the adsorbent
surface. The theoretical monolayer saturation capacities (Qmax) derived from the Langmuir plot were found
to be 4.7 and 187.3 mg/g, respectively, for MB and SY, which were
closely similar to the corresponding experimental values, 3.9 and
168.7 mg/g. However, compared to Hs–Cs–HAp, native HAp
shows ∼60% less adsorption of MB and ∼95% less adsorption
of SY in similar experimental conditions in three different concentration
ranges (Figure S12).

2.2.3 Effect of Contact Time and Kinetics
The time of contact
between the adsorbate and the adsorbent is a
vital information to evaluate their related properties. The effects
of contact time on the MB and SY adsorption process by the Hs–Cs–HAp
are presented in Figure S13. Results revealed
that for both the dyes, the adsorption process was initially fast
for abundant availability of the adsorbate and the binding sites;
then, it slowed down to reach the equilibrium. Rate of adsorption
of SY was faster than that of MB. In the case of MB, 3.5 h was required
to attain ∼97% adsorption, which was only 75 min for SY. Final
equilibrium times for MB and SY were 6 and 3.5 h, respectively. Apart
from compositional features, functional groups distribution, and surface
characteristics of the material, intraparticle diffusion of adsorbate
through the porous network of the adsorbent also plays a significant
role in the adsorption process. To elucidate complex adsorbent–adsorbate
interaction, the experimental kinetics data of the present system
were analyzed with two different conventional kinetics rate models.
Pseudo-first order (eq 3), a simple kinetic analysis of adsorption, and in addition pseudo-second
order rate model (eq 4) were used for analyses. 3   4  where “qe” and “qt” denote the adsorption of the adsorbate (mg/g) by the
adsorbent
at equilibrium and at time “t”, respectively;
“k1” and “k2” are the pseudo-first order and pseudo-second
order rate constants, respectively. Related results are presented
in Figure S14, which revealed that the
pseudo-second order rate model is the better suited model (high correlation
coefficient) to explain the adsorption process of the dyes. This was
further authenticated with experimental kinetic data and corresponding
nonlinear curve fitting of the two different rate models for the dyes
(Figure 7). The derived
rate constants obtained from the two rate models are presented at Table 1. However, in case
of porous adsorbent, rate is not confined to the surface adsorption
only, diffusion of adsorbate through the porous polymeric network
to bind the internal binding sites of the adsorbent had also a significant
role in the binding mechanism. Hence, apart from conventional rate
models, the intra-particle diffusion model5,6,33 (eq 5) also tried to understand the rate-controlling mechanism
of the present adsorption system. 5  In this model, kd is the intrinsic rate constant, C0,
is the initial concentration, “D” is
the diffusion coefficient, and “t”
is the adsorbate–adsorbent contact time. It is clear from the
plot (Figure 8) that
the adsorption process was a two-step process and hence not restricted
to surface adsorption only. Intraparticle diffusion also acted after
the surface adsorption, before the system reached the equilibrium
in both cases. Parameters related to rate equation plot of the kinetic
date are presented in Table 1.

the two conventional rate models (a) Hs–Cs–HAp–MB
and (b) Hs–Cs–HAp–SY adsorption systems.

Because multiple rate controlling mechanisms were
involved in the
process, and hence, to determine the rate limiting steps of this adsorption
system, kinetic data were further fitted to the Boyd plot (eq 6). 6  where Bt is the mathematical function of “F” and “F” = (qt/qe) represents
the fraction of the adsorbate adsorbed at a particular time. The average
poor linear fits of the data for both the dyes did not pass through
the origin (Figure S15), indicating that
surface adsorption was the rate controlling step of the present adsorption

2.2.4 Mechanism of Adsorption
It is clear
from the FTIR (Figure S4) and XPS (Figures S5 and S6)
analysis that the composite surface is facilitated with multiple functional
groups. In fact, constituent of the composite is highly rich with
primary and secondary organic hydroxyl groups (Hs and Cs), inorganic
hydroxyl groups (HAp), Primary and secondary ammines (Hs and Cs),
carboxylic acid (Hs and Cs), amides (Hs and Cs), and PO43– groups (HAp). Because of high density of the
hydroxyl and amine groups, both of the constituting polymers are highly
polycationic in nature (iso-electric point above pH 8.0).38−40 Hence, both the polymers acquired sharp +ve surface charge in acidic
pH due to instant protonation of these groups. However, both the polymers
have tendency to acquire mild −ve charge at highly basic pH
due to adsorption of OH–. This highly polycationic
in nature aids it to attract (due to electrostatic interaction) acid
dyes (SY) more sharply at acidic pH than basic dyes (MB) at basic
pH. Hence, rate and extent of adsorption of acid dyes by this composite
are higher than those of basic dyes. After initial electrostatic force
of attraction, hydrogen bonding interaction between polar head groups
of dye molecules and composite plays a vital role to bind the dye
with the composite.6,13,16 However, minimal adsorption of MB and SY (Figure S12) by native HAp may be explained by the lack of availability
of the functional groups.

2.3 Desorption
and Regeneration Studies
Desorption of dye from the loaded
material was tried either by water
of different pH or by varied compositions of ethanol/water mixture.
Mixture of ethanol (95%) and water [75% (v/v)] was found to be the
most suitable eluent to desorb entire adsorbed MB from the loaded
material in 7 h. Water at pH 12.0 was found to regenerate the composite
from the SY-loaded material within 30 min of treatment. In both cases,
the regenerated Hs–Cs–HAp material did not show any
deterioration of adsorption efficacy up to five adsorption/desorption
cycles (Figure 9).
Moreover, there was no loss of adsorbent (during material recovery)
noticed after each adsorption/desorption cycle in case of both the
dyes, indicating that composite is very much stable under wide pH
operating conditions.

adsorption.

2.4 Removal
of Commercial Dyes and Treatment Tannery
Wastewater
Evaluation of efficiency of the studied composite
toward the removal of four different commercial dyes from aqueous
solution at their optimum application condition indicated very high
dye removal efficiency toward all the four dyes (Figure 10a–d). The material
was able to adsorb maximum 496 mg/g of Orange-NR, 488 mg/g of Blue-113,
477 mg/g Red-VLN, and 274 mg/g of Green-PBS dyes from their individual
solutions, and in most of the cases, maximum adsorption was accomplished
within first 5–6 h except for 500 ppm solution of Orange-NR
and Red-VLN dyes. The system took ∼20–22 h to reach
equilibrium in both cases. Photographs of all the dye-adsorbed Hs–Cs–HAp
are presented in Figure 11a–f.

by Hs–Cs–HAp.

(d) Red-VLN, (e) Blue-113, and (f) Green-PBS adsorbed Hs–Cs–HAp.

The wastewater often contains
mixture of multiple dyes; thus, it
was essential to evaluate the performance of the adsorbent material
to treat multiple-dye containing solutions. Our investigation with
the cocktail dye solution demonstrated (Figure 12a) that only 50 mg material was decolorized
up to 100 ppm (50 mL) of the cocktail dye solution effectively. Similar
results were also observed when the material was employed in a higher
quantity (Figure 12b). The only advantage was that the rate of decolorization was faster
with a higher adsorbent–adsorbate ratio. From 150 ppm onward,
the material was unable to decolorize the solution completely, where
the system attained equilibrium within 300 min. Maximum 97.5% removal
of dye from 150 ppm solution was achieved with 200 mg of the material.
However, the colored effluent released by the industry expected to
be contaminated with various other kinds of organic and inorganic
contaminants, which might interfered the dye adsorption process. Therefore,
it was necessary to evaluate the performance of the material toward
the real industrial effluent. During this study, 100 mL of dye-containing
tannery effluent was treated with different amounts (50–200
mg) of the composite material without altering the physicochemical
condition (pH = 3.6, temp = 27 °C) of the effluent. It was evident
from the outcome that the 100 mg of composite was enough to decolorize
the entire 100 mL of the colored tannery effluent completely within
180 min of the treatment (Figure 13). These studies clearly indicated that the present
composite was highly efficient for the treatment of multicomponent
complex, dye-bearing industrial effluent.

3 Conclusions
In the present article,
we report a simple economic and scalable
synthesis of a low-cost novel biopolymer–inorganic porous composite
(Hs–Cs–HAp) having multiple functional groups utilizing
material from waste origin via a simple method. The synthesized composite
is rough, hard, and less hydrophilic in nature compared to the native
polymers and is ideal for use as an adsorbent material. The composite
material is able to remove model dye MB (3.8 mg/g) and SY (168 mg/g)
successfully, and it has higher affinity toward acid dyes because
of its polycationic nature. Equilibrium isotherm and kinetic model
analyses proposed that the adsorption of dyes by this material is
a chemisorption process (ionic interaction followed by H-bonding)
via monolayer formation through the interaction of the dye molecules
with the active site of the material, and the rate of the process
is controlled by the pseudo-second order kinetic model. Adsorbed dye
can be desorbed easily with simple change in pH, and the composite
material can be recycled at least five more times without any loss
of its efficacy. The material is not only able to remove efficiently
four commercial dyes from their individual and cocktail solutions
but also able to decolorize dye-bearing leather processing wastewater
effectively. Hence, this material has enormous potential for the large-scale
dye-bearing wastewater treatment application. Therefore, in present
research, some industrial wastes can be successfully converted into
a biocomposite, which subsequently effectively employed to reduce
water pollution generated by other sources.

4 Materials
and Experimentals
4.1 Chemicals and Reagents
Hs used in
this study was prepared in our laboratory by a traditional procedure.
Medium-molecular weight Cs isolated from crab shell was procured from
Sigma-Aldrich, and all other used chemicals were of analytical grade,
purchased from E. Merck, India. Commercial dyes were procured from
our in-house tanning unit, and the dye-bearing tannery wastewater
was collected from a local leather processing unit (Weblec India).

4.2 Synthesis of Adsorbent
Degassed individual
solution (2% w/v ) of Cs and Hs in 7% (v/v) AcOH containing 4.8 g
Ca(NO3)2·4H2O and 1.9 g NaH2PO4·2H2O respectively were mixed
together so that the Ca/P ratio in the blend remained at ∼1.6:1.
Mixture was stirred for 10 h at room temperature (RT ≈ 27 °C)
and was slowly decanted to a similar volume of alkali-coagulating
mixture (NaOH/EtOH/H2O ≡ 1:4:5; w/w) under vigorous
stirring for 15 min. The pH of the mixture was then maintained at
13 by adding NaOH, and stirring was continued for 48 h. Generated
suspended solid was collected by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm and
washed with deionized water until neutral pH was obtained. The collected
material was then vacuum-dried at 105 °C till constant weight:
the dried material was pulverized using an agate mortar pestle followed
by sieving to collect fine particles. The resulted composite was then
kept in a desiccator for use. The native HAp was synthesized in a
similar fashion without the presence of Hs and Cs.

4.3 Characterization of the Hs–Cs–HAp
Composite
The material properties of the developed composite
have been evaluated by several techniques. The FTIR spectra of the
material along with native polymers have been recorded with a Shimadzu
FTIR 8300 spectrophotometer in KBr pellets at room temperature. SSNMR
data of each material were acquired using Bruker DSX 300, NMR Spectrometer
following the combined techniques of proton dipolar decoupling, magic
angle spinning, and cross polarization. XPS spectra of the samples
were recorded using an Omicron energy analyzer equipped with monochromatic
X-ray sources. TGA of the samples was measured under a nitrogen atmosphere
with a TFAQ50 V 6.1 Build 181 instrument. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
pattern of the composite was acquired using a Seifert C 3000 instrument
with the operating conditions, −40 kV and 30 mA with a Cu/Ni
radiation at λ = 1.5406. BET surface area and total pore volume
of the material were obtained by measuring their nitrogen adsorption
isotherm at 77 K in a surface area and porosity analyzer (Quantachrome
Autosorb automated gas sorption system). Morphology of the composite
was recorded using a Novax zoom stereo microscope by Euromex Microscopen
B.V. Holland, and the surface micro-/nanostructure of the material
was characterized using an FEI Quanta 200F scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) instrument and TEM analysis was carried out using a Jeol JEM
2100 microscope. Details of sample preparation and data acquisition
particularly related to each material characterization process discussed
here has been mentioned in Supporting Information.

4.4 Adsorption Experiment with Model Dyes
All the dye adsorption studies during this investigation were performed
using the batch technique in 100 mL Erlenmeyer flasks with 50 mL of
the dye solution using 50 mg of composite under constant shaking (150
rpm) in a temperature-controlled shaker. In the entire adsorption
experimentation, at the end of desired incubation period (24 h; which
was expected to be far beyond the time to reach equilibrium found
from separate experimentations), the adsorbent was then separated
by centrifugation at 5000 rpm, and the dye concentration in the supernatant
was measured by a Sican UV–vis spectrophotometer using standard
curves of the respective dyes at the particular experimental conditions.
Each data point during entire investigation was collected from individual
containers and average of three replicating experiments. Optimization
of pH was carried out at an ambient temperature of ∼27 °C
with 10 ppm MB and 100 ppm SY solution varying the pH of the experimental
solutions from 1.0 to 12.0 (adjusted with dilute H2SO4 and NaOH solutions). To determine the optimum temperature
of the process, experimentations were performed in the range 10–40
°C with the same initial concentration of each dye keeping fixed
pH and time (24 h). For determination of equilibrium adsorption isotherms,
varied concentrations of the dyes (5–40 ppm; MB and 50–400
ppm: SY) were added to a constant amount of the adsorbent, keeping
other conditions fixed (optimum pH and temp for 24 h). The kinetics
adsorption process was observed up to 24 h with 10 ppm MB and 500
ppm SY solution by analyzing the adsorption data at different predetermine
time intervals by fixing other parameters at optimum. During entire
adsorption studies, percentage of removal (R %) and
amount of dye adsorbed at equilibrium (qe, mg/g) and at specific time (qt, mg/g) were calculated from the following equations.  where C0 (mg/L)
is the initial concentration of dye; Ct and Ce are the concentrations
(mg/L) of the dye at any specific time (t) and at
equilibrium, respectively.

4.5 Regeneration and Recycling
Studies
After completion of the dye adsorption experiment,
the dye-loaded
composite material was collected by filtration and washed thoroughly
with distilled water, and the desorption of the dyes from the loaded
composites was carried out either by water or water–ethanol
mixture at specific pH. After desorption, the composites were separated
by filtration and washed with de-ionized water for three times. After
drying, the recovered composites were subjected again to adsorption/desorption
cycle, which was conducted for five times in each case.

4.6 Performance Evaluation with Commercial Dyes
and Tannery Wastewater
Performance of the material toward
the removal of the four different commercial dyes (Orange-NR, Red-VLN,
Blue-113, and Green-PBS) generally used for leather dyeing purposes
has been evaluated with 50 mg of the material and 50 mL of each dye
solution in three different concentrations (50, 250, and 500 ppm).
Experimental conditions were simulated similarly in which they were
used for leather dying purposes (∼27 °C and pH 3.0), and
the adsorption process was observed spectrophotometrically in specific
time intervals till the systems attained equilibrium for each case.

To assess the performance of the material in the presence of multiple
dye conditions, equal weight mixtures (thoroughly mixed) of all the
four commercial dyes used in the above-described experiments were
considered. The adsorption studies were done with 50, 100, and 200
mg of the adsorbent material and 50 mL of cocktail dye solutions of
various concentrations (50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 ppm) at ∼27
°C, pH 3.0 (optimum application condition of all the constituent
dyes) in 150 rpm mixing condition. The other experimental conditions
were the same, as described above for the single dye component.

To evaluate the efficiency of the material toward the treatment
of real colored wastewater, samples of dye exhaust bath were collected
from the local tannery after the leather dying process, and then,
it was centrifuged at 5000 rpm to remove any suspended particles,
and the supernatant was collected for further use. Three sets of centrifuged
colored wastewater samples (pH = 3.6) each of 100 mL wastewater samples
in each were shaken at 150 rpm at RT (∼27 °C) with 50,
100, and 200 mg of the Hs–Cs–HAp, respectively, without
modifying its physicochemical conditions. Efficiency of the treatments
was then evaluated by UV–visible spectrophotometry after 12
h.
