A series
of electron-accepting azaacene-type materials 1–4 with different kinds and degrees of intermolecular
interactions were synthesized. Simple modification of the terminal
substituents significantly modulated the photophysical and electrochemical
properties. The degree of weak intermolecular interaction determined
the emergence of a liquid crystalline (LC) phase for each compound.
Dipole–dipole interaction, π–π interaction,
and van der Waals interaction all contributed to stabilize the LC
phase of 1 and 2. The introduction of strong
hydrogen bonding interaction enabled the formation of a highly ordered
LC phase in 4. Charge-transport properties of 1, 2, and 4 were also investigated.

Introduction
Organic electron donors
and acceptors have been studied from a
variety of viewpoints, including with respect to organic conductors,1 photovoltaics,2 luminescent
devices,3 sensors,4 and supramolecular structures.5 Organic
semiconducting materials have attracted attention over the past few
decades.6 Although several materials with
excellent hole transport, including pentacene,7 benzothienobenzothiophene8 and rubrene,9 have been reported, there have been few reports
on materials with good electron-transport properties.6 The hole/electron mobility of organic materials is governed
by the electronic properties and packing arrangement of the molecules
and the homogeneity of the thin film. Thus, not only modulation of
the electronic properties of an organic electron donor/acceptor but
also control of the molecular arrangement and preparation of a clean
thin crystalline film with minimal defects should be necessary for
the development of a good organic field-effect transistor (FET). Electronically
active liquid crystalline (LC) materials have attracted attention
regarding their potential application in organic electronic devices
due to their high solubility in common organic solvents, controllable
molecular arrangement, and crystallinity. A variety of p-type LC materials
have been reported including calamitic terthiophene derivatives10 and discotic hexabenzocoronene derivatives.11 The relationship between the LC phase and mobility
has been studied, and high mobility was observed in a highly ordered
LC phase due to dense molecular packing and effective intermolecular
overlap of frontier orbitals.10 On the
other hand, electron-accepting LC materials have been limited: LC
fullerene12 and naphthalene/perylene bisimide13 derivatives have been reported by Nakanishi
and Funahashi, respectively.

Azaacene derivatives14,15 have attracted attention
for their potential application in n-type FETs due to their high electron-accepting
properties coupled with the excellent charge-transport properties
of acene. Azaacene derivatives with a pyrazine or pyrazinopyrazine
π electronic core are good electron acceptors due to the electron-deficient
nature of the corresponding π units. The preparation as well
as charge-transport properties of non-liquid crystalline azaacene
derivatives has been investigated.15 On
the other hand, studies on LC azaacene have seldom conducted. Recently,
Isoda et al. reported LC azaacene derivatives, quinoxalinoquinoxaline
(QQ), with branched alkoxy chains to form a one-dimensional hexagonal
columnar mesophase.16 We also independently
developed LC azaacene derivatives based on dialkoxydicyanopyrazinoquinoxalines
(DPQ: 1Figure 1).17 These compounds formed a thermotropic
SmA or SmC LC phase, which was stabilized by cooperative stabilization
by weak intermolecular interactions: π–π, dipole–dipole,
and van der Waals interactions. These compounds also showed high electron-accepting
properties thanks to the combination of the electron-deficient pyrazinoquinoxaline
(PQ) π core and electron-accepting cyano units. Because the
subtle change in terminal units drastically affected the LC state,
it is necessary to understand the molecular assemblies of LC azaacene
derivatives for design and development of flexible organic electronic
materials.

for derivatization. (b) Molecular structures of 2–4.

We thought that this DPQ 1 would be a suitable candidate
for structure–electronic/arrangement studies on substituted
pyrazinoquinoxaline derivatives for the following reasons: (1) A variety
of derivatives could be readily synthesized from the corresponding o-phenylenediamine and o-dichloroarenes.
(2) Because the LC state of DPQ is governed by weak noncovalent interactions,
modulation of these factors by chemical modification such as an increase/decrease
in the number of substituents as well as π conjugation should
both modulate the electronic properties and lead to different molecular
assemblies. (3) Electron-accepting cyano groups could serve as transformable
functional groups (Figure 1). Herein, we report the preparation of a series of compounds
derived from DPQ 2–4 and their electronic
properties and assemblies.

Results and Discussion
Preparation and Photo-
and Electrochemical Properties of 1–4
Compounds 1–4 were prepared
as summarized in Scheme 1. Based on our previous preparation of DPQ 1,17 we anticipated that we could
synthesize a series of DPQ derivatives with different numbers of alkoxy
and cyano groups from the corresponding o-phenylenediamine
and dichloropyrazine. Monododecyloxydicyano PQ 3 could
be synthesized by condensation of dodecyloxy-o-phenylenediamine
and dichlorodicyanopyrazine, followed by dehydrogenation with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-p-benzoquinone (DDQ). This approach could be used to prepare
π-extended QQ analogue 2. The dihydro derivatives
could not be isolated due to their low solubility. The low isolated
yield of 2 and 3 could be accounted for
by the polymerization of highly reactive o-phenylenediamine
derivatives and the difficulty of purification from structurally undetermined
monomeric byproduct(s). However, thanks to the short-step synthesis,
we could synthesize enough new compounds 2 and 3 to study their physical properties. On the other hand, there
were several limitations to the preparation of other derivatives (see
the Supporting Information).

Scheme 1 Preparation
of 1–4
Transformation of cyano functional groups of DPQ enabled
us to
obtain its derivatives with different electronic natures and intermolecular
interactions in the molecular assembly. Simple hydrolysis of DPQ 1b gave the corresponding 1,4-dihydropyrazinoquinoxalinedione 4 as a new π scaffold. Whereas 1–3 were highly soluble in common organic solvents such as CHCl3, CH2Cl2, dioxane, etc., dihydropyrazinoquinoxalinedione 4 was quite insoluble, probably due to strong intermolecular
hydrogen bonding between carbonyl groups and dihydropyrazine N–H
groups. Compound 4 is slightly soluble in pyridine, dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide (DMF), and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP).

The photophysical and electrochemical properties of newly
synthesized
materials 2–4 were examined by UV–vis
spectra and cyclic voltammetry measurements. Figure 2 shows the UV–vis spectra of 1–4 in CH2Cl2 (for 1–3) or NMP/pyridine (for 4). Several absorption bands were observed for 2–4 in the UV and visible regions, which were similar to those
for 1. Whereas a simple and sharp lowest-energy π–π*
absorption peak was observed at 392–447 nm for 1, 2, and 4, that for 3 was
broad and split into two bands (398 and 477 nm). As a result, the
absorption end of 3 is more bathochromic than the other
derivatives. Compound 4 showed a distinct blue-shift
compared with 1–3, which could be
accounted for by the loss of an electron-deficient pyrazinopyrazine
unit and electron-withdrawing cyano groups (vide infra). Whereas 1–3 with strong electron-withdrawing cyano
groups were not emissive, 4 exhibited a clear fluorescence
at λem,max = 423 nm, with a moderate quantum yield
of 23% in solution. The intramolecular dipole moment and charge transfer
interaction determine the fluorescence activity of 1–4.18

Figure 2 UV–vis spectra
of 1–4 and
fluorescence spectrum of 4 (λex = 380
nm).

Figure 3 shows the
cyclic voltammograms of 1–3 in CH2Cl2. Table 1 summarizes the redox potentials of 1–3 and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies of 1–4 determined by cyclic voltammograms and density functional
theory (DFT) calculations. Reversible two-step one-electron reduction
processes and an irreversible one-step one-electron oxidation wave
were observed in 2 and 3, which is similar
to the results with 1. The reduction and oxidation peaks
of 2 were distinctly lower than those of 1, which should be due to the loss of an electron-withdrawing cyano
group. MonoalkoxyPQ 3 showed a higher reduction potential
than 1, which is consistent with the loss of an electron-donating
alkoxy group. On the other hand, its oxidation potential was lower
than that of 1, which reflects a higher electron-donating
property. This could probably be accounted for by the resolution of
degeneracy of the molecular orbital of 3 due to desymmetrization.
In fact, the calculated frontier orbitals of 3 possessed
different distributions from those of 1 (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The DFT calculations
reproduced the trend of the experimentally determined reduction potentials.
The calculated oxidation potentials did not reproduce the experimental
trend, which might be due to the solvation effect. Although the redox
properties of 4 could not be determined due to its limited
solubility, its HOMO and LUMO energies could be estimated by DFT calculations.
The HOMO and LUMO energies of 4 were obviously higher
than those of 1–3, which indicated
the lower electron-accepting properties of 4. The loss
of an electron-deficient pyrazinopyrazine unit of 1 and
an electron-withdrawing cyano group affected the LUMO energy more
than it did the HOMO energy. As a result, the HOMO–LUMO gap
for 4 was greater than that for 1–3 and, thus, a distinctive blue-shift was observed in the
UV–vis spectrum of 4.

Molecular Assemblies and
LC States of 1–4
The LC
properties of 1–4 were examined by
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC),
polarized optical microscopy (POM), and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD)
measurements. We previously reported that DPQ 1a–c formed a thermotropic calamitic LC phase, which was cooperatively
stabilized by weak intermolecular interactions: π–π
interaction of DPQ π cores, dipole–dipole interaction
of polar cyano groups, and van der Waals interactions of aliphatic
chains. A systematic comparison of structurally similar 1–3 with different numbers of alkoxy chains, cyano
groups, and aromatic rings should reveal the requirements for the
formation of a liquid crystalline state with azaacene derivatives.
Thermogravimetric (TG) analyses of 1–3 revealed that they were thermally stable up to 573 K (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Figure 4a summarizes the
DSC results for 1b, 2, and 3. The thermochemical behavior of 2 was quite similar
to that of 1b(17) with the same
number of alkoxy chains. A reversible solid–solid (S–S)
phase transition (308 K with ΔH = 5.46 kJ mol–1 for 2 and 342 K with ΔH = 14.6 kJ mol–1 for 1b)
and solid–isotropic liquid (S–IL) phase transition (473
K with ΔH = 23.0 kJ mol–1 for 2 and 445 K with ΔH = 29.3
kJ mol–1 for 1b) were observed for
both compounds during heating process (Figure 4a). During cooling, an IL–LC phase
transition and similar batonnet-like textures, typical to a SmA phase,
were monotropically observed (Figure 4b, 472 K (ΔH = 2.98 kJ mol–1) to 459 K (ΔH = 17.9 kJ mol–1) for 2 and 443 K (ΔH = 4.84 kJ mol–1) to 423 K (ΔH = 21.5 kJ mol–1) for 1b). Before
the SmA–S phase transition during cooling, a shoulder-like
endothermic peak was observed in a very narrow temperature range.
This similar thermal process and POM images strongly indicate that 2 forms a monotropic SmA phase, similar to 1b. The XRD measurement of 2 supported this conclusion
(Figure 4c). In the
LC phase, diffraction peaks were observed at 2θ = ∼3,
5.74, and 8.14°, which corresponded to the (001), (002), and
(003) diffractions of d001 = 30.8 Å,
respectively. Because the calculated molecular length of 2 along the long axis (ca. 23 Å) was shorter than the observed d001 distance, the molecule forms a significant
π dimer structure (Figure 4d). The length of the dimer structure with the overlapping
π plane (ca. 31 Å) is consistent with the d001 distance. Whereas 2 exhibited LC properties
similar to those of 1b, didodecyloxyQQ without a cyano
group did not form an LC phase.16a These
results revealed that one cyano group is necessary and sufficient
to form a significant π dimer structure to induce an LC phase
with dialkoxyazaacene derivatives. In contrast to the number of cyano
groups, the difference in the number of alkoxy chains strongly affected
the emergence of the LC phase. No phase transition involving the LC
phase was observed for 3 with one alkoxy chain: only
a broad S–IL phase transition was observed. If we consider
that thermally activated molecular rotation occurs along the long
axis of the rodlike dimer in the LC state, the alkoxy chains contribute
to increase in the flexibility/rotatability of the corresponding π
dimer to induce the LC state. The decrease in alkoxy chains in 3 reduced the flexibility of the π dimer.

The SmA phase observed in 1b and 2 does
not exhibit ordering of the molecular arrangement in the layer parallel
to the short axis of the molecules in the assembly; the LC states
of 1b and 2 are thermodynamically unstable
and only observed in the super-cooling state. Because the LC states
of 1 and 2 were governed by weak intermolecular
interactions, the introduction of a strong intermolecular interaction
such as hydrogen bonding should induce a different assembly structure.
Because compound 4 could form intermolecular hydrogen
bonds along the short axis of the molecule between dihydropyrazine
and carbonyl units,20 we anticipated that
this compound could form a thermodynamically stable higher-ordered
LC phase. The TG analysis of 4 revealed that it possessed
high thermal stability up to 573 K (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Figure 5a shows the DSC results for 4. Three pairs
of reversible exothermic and endothermic peaks were observed, indicating
the existence of four thermodynamically stable phases. The lowest-temperature
phase transition (370 K, ΔH = 6.23 kJ mol–1) was the S–S phase transition due to the nonfluidity
of these phases. The S–LC phase transition was observed with
a relatively huge ΔH value (10.4 kJ mol–1), indicating a substantial change in the nature of
assembly between the S2 and LC1 phases. A LC–LC
phase transition was observed at 470 K with a small ΔH value (2.52 kJ mol–1). No LC–IL
phase transition was observed. Although the liquid crystallinity of
the both LC1 and LC2 phase was demonstrated
by their fluidity and birefringence under POM observation (Figure 5b), we could not
elucidate the LC phase or the molecular assembly from POM images.
Thus, we performed the XRD measurements for 4. Figure 5c summarizes the
XRD patterns of the S1, S2, LC1,
and LC2 phases. Three strong low-angle diffraction peaks
were observed at 2θ = 2.04, 4.14, and 6.30° for S1 and 2θ = 2.06, 4.26, and 6.44° for S2, which
corresponded to (001) spacing of 43.3 and 42.8 Å, respectively.
Considering the molecular length along the long axis of 4 (23 Å assuming an all-trans conformation for the C12H25O– chain), a fundamental head-to-head bilayer
structure was formed in both the S1 and S2 phases
(Figure 6b). In the
bilayer structure, N–H groups of hydropyrazine and C=O
groups were arranged in a closed fashion to form effective intermolecular
hydrogen bonding in the bilayer (Figure 6a). In fact, the N–H stretching vibration
of 4 was observed at 3100 cm–1 in IR
spectrum at room temperature (Figure S3, Supporting Information), indicating effective hydrogen bonding
in the solid state.

and in the LC states. Schematic molecular arrangements of 4 in (b) the solid states, (c) SmB state, and (d) SmC state.

Three strong low-angle diffraction
peaks at 2θ = 2.30, 4.70,
and 7.16° were observed for the LC1 phase, which corresponded
to the (001), (002), and (003) diffractions of d001 = 38.4 Å, respectively. In addition, a high-angle
diffraction peak was observed at 2θ = 18.2°, which was
assigned to the (100) reflection of d100 = 4.89 Å. These results indicated a SmB phase with a bilayer
structure with a short-range order for the LC1 phase of 4. The ΔH value (10.4 kJ mol–1) observed for S2–SmB phase transition is typical
to S–SmB phase transition enthalpy.21 Temperature-dependent IR measurement of 4 revealed
that intermolecular N–H···O=C hydrogen
bonding remained both in LC1 and LC2 phase (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). Thermal
activation of 4 induced a microscopic change in the molecular
arrangement while maintaining hydrogen-bonding interactions to induce
the phase transition from the S2 phase to SmB phase, as
illustrated in Figure 6b. This phase transition also induced the interdigitation of alkoxy
chains in the bilayer structure to shorten the d001 distance. Only (001), (002), and (003) diffraction peaks
(2θ = 2.56, 5.26, and 7.94°) were observed for the LC2 phase, which corresponded to the shorter d001 = 34.5 Å diffraction pattern. If we consider
the facts that the alkyl chains completely melt in the calamitic LC
phases,22 tilting of the molecular assembly
is reasonable to account for the shorter interlayer distance of LC2 phase, rather than further alkyl interdigitation. Because
the high-angle diffraction peak was not observed in the LC2 phase (Figure 5c),
this LC phase lost short-range order in the bilayer structure. Considering
the length of the molecule and its components (ca. 10 Å for π
unit and ca. 13 Å for aliphatic chain), the LC2 phase
could be characterized as the SmC phase with a tilt angle of ca. 30°.

Charge-Carrier Transport Properties
Redox-active π-planar
molecules with LC properties are often expected to show high compatibility
of electron transport properties along their one-dimensional or two-dimensional
ordered molecular alignments and flexibility of the materials. We
previously reported the hole-transport properties of 1b in the LC state. Time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements
were performed to assess the electronic conductivity in 1b, 2, and 4 upon photoexcitation at 355
nm (Figure 7). In their
polycrystalline states, only compound 1b showed remarkable
photoconductivity traces upon excitation at 355 nm, in contrast to
the negligible photoconductivity recorded in 2 and 4.

Figure 7 Photoconductivity kinetic traces observed for (a) 1b, (b) 2, and (c) 4 at room temperature
(rt) upon excitation with a 355 nm laser pulses at 5.2 × 1015 photons cm–2.

Even in 1b, the observed maximum photoconductivity
was <10–5 cm2 V–2 s–1, which suggested that there are no conductive
pathways in the crystallites of the compound. However, the electronic-conductive
nature of 1b changes dramatically upon heating to 440–450
K, and the observed kinetic traces are shown in Figure 8. This jump in photoconductivity at 430–440
K corresponds well to the mesophase transition observed in the DSC
traces, leading to the SmA liquid crystalline phase of 1b. The maximum photoconductivity is up to 5-fold in comparison with
that in polycrystalline phase, suggesting that planar alignment of
the molecules preserves the two-dimensional pathway for charge transport
in the system. This change could be accounted for by the change in
the molecular arrangement of DPQ in the solid state and LC state.
Overlap of the π core of DPQs was achieved in the SmA phase
to attain a conducting pathway, whereas the DPQ π core was arranged
in a zig-zag fashion in the solid state without overlapping. It should
be noted that this considerable enhancement of conductivity was observed
around 440 K, where disordering of the molecular structure often occurs
in most molecular electronic-conductive materials with a significant
decrease in the mobility of charge carriers.

Figure 8 Temperature dependence
of the photoconductivity kinetic traces
observed in 1b upon pulse excitation with a 355 nm laser
at 5.2–7.3 × 1015 photons cm–2. The kinetic traces at 445 and 440 K were observed successively
after annealing at 470 K, when the compound was in the isotropic phase.

Summary
A series
of electron-accepting acene-type materials 1–4 with different kinds and degrees of
intermolecular interactions were synthesized. They could be readily
obtained by condensation between the corresponding o-phenylenediamine and electron-deficient dichloropyrazine derivatives
(1–3) and a simple hydrolysis reaction
of 1 (4). Simple modification of the terminal
substituents significantly modulated the photophysical and electrochemical
properties of these DPQ derivatives. The degree of weak intermolecular
interaction determined the emergence of the LC phase for each compound.
Dipole–dipole interaction, π–π interaction,
and van der Waals interaction all contributed to stabilize LC phase
of 1–3. Especially, the degree of
van der Waals interaction between alkoxy chains significantly affected
the stability of the LC phase of DPQ derivatives. Introduction of
strong hydrogen-bonding interaction enabled the formation of a highly
ordered LC phase in 4. Although the conducting properties
of 1–4 were not especially excellent
due to a less-suitable molecular arrangement and/or limited electron-accepting
properties, the electron-deficient acene LC with a well-defined molecular
arrangement may lead to the development of n-type semiconducting materials
with high applicability, which is now under investigation in our laboratory.

Experimental Section
General Methods
Commercially available
reagents and
solvents were used as received. DPQ 1 was prepared as
described in the literature.17 4,5-Didodecyloxy-1,2-phenylenediamine 5,23 2,3-dichloro-6-cyanoquinoxaline 6,24 and 4-dodecyloxy-1,2-phenylenediamine 7(25) were prepared from catechol,
3,4-diaminobenzonitrile, and 4-amino-3-nitrophenol, respectively,
as reported in the literature. Silica gel BW-300 (Fuji Silisia) and
silica gel 60 (Merck) were used for column chromatography. Recycling
gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed using a Japan Analytical
Industry LC-9201 equipped with JAIGEL 1H and 2H columns. 1H (400 MHz) and 13C (100 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded
on a Bruker Avance III 400 NMR spectrometer. Chemical shifts (δ)
are expressed in ppm relative to tetramethylsilane (1H
0.00 ppm) or residual nondeuterated solvent (CDCl3; 13C 77.0 ppm) as an internal standard. Mass spectra were recorded
on a JMS-700 spectrometer at the NMR and MS Laboratory, Graduate School
of Agriculture, Tohoku University. Elemental analyses were performed
on a Microcoder JM10 at the Elementary Analysis Laboratory, Institute
of Multidisciplinary Research for Advanced Materials, Tohoku University.
IR, UV–vis–NIR and fluorescence spectra were measured
on a Thermo Scientific NICOLET 6700 FT-IR, a Perkin-Elmer LAMBDA 750,
and a Shimadzu RF-6000 spectrometer, respectively. Differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a Rigaku Thermo plus TG-8120 at
a scan rate of 10 K min–1. Variable-temperature
X-ray diffraction was conducted on a Rigaku Rint-Ultima III diffractometer
using Cu Kα (λ = 1.54187 Å).

Preparation of 2
A mixture of 4,5-didodecyloxy-1,2-phenylenediamine 5 (3.04 g, 6.37 mmol) and 2,3-dichloro-6-cyanoquinoxaline 6 (1.45 g, 6.47 mmol) in dry MeCN (110 mL) was refluxed for
23 h. After the mixture was allowed to cool to rt, the resulting precipitate
was collected by filtration to give the crude product containing 9 (3.57 g), which was used for the next reaction without further
purification. The suspension of the crude product and 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-p-benzoquinone (DDQ) (1.76 g, 7.75 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran
(THF) (150 mL) was stirred at rt for 122 h. After evaporation of the
solvent under reduced pressure, the crude product was dissolved in
CH2Cl2 and then passed through silica gel with
a mixed solvent of CH2Cl2/THF (5:1) as an eluent.
The eluted dark-brown solution was concentrated under reduced pressure
and suspended in CHCl3. The insoluble material was removed
by filtration and the filtrate was purified by recycling GPC, silica
gel column chromatography, and recrystallization from EtOH/CHCl3 to give 2 (208 mg, 5.2%) as an orange solid.

Preparation of 3
A mixture of 4-dodecyloxy-1,2-phenylenediamine 7 (2.20 g, 7.54 mmol) and 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanopyrazine 8 (1.50 g, 7.54 mmol) in dry MeCN (130 mL) was refluxed for
23 h. After the mixture was allowed to cool to rt, the resulting precipitate
was collected by filtration to give the crude product containing 10 (2.77 g), which was used for the next reaction without
further purification. The mixture of the crude product and DDQ (2.10
g, 9.27 mmol) in THF (150 mL) was stirred at rt for 170 h. After evaporation
of the solvent under reduced pressure, the crude product was dissolved
in CH2Cl2 and then passed through silica gel
with CH2Cl2 as an eluent. The eluted solution
was concentrated under reduced pressure and purified by recycling
GPC followed by recrystallization from EtOH/CHCl3 to give 3 (627 mg, 20%) as an orange solid.

Preparation of 4
The mixture of DPQ 1b (504 mg, 838 μmol) and KOH (937 mg, 17.4 mmol) in
a mix solvent of EtOH and H2O (1:1, 100 mL) was refluxed
for 24 h. After the mixture was allowed to cool to rt, concn HCl was
added until the pH of the mixture became 1. The resulting precipitate
was collected by filtration, washed with H2O, and dried
under vacuum. The obtained solid was repeatedly recrystallized from
EtOH/toluene followed by DMSO to give 4 (75.8 mg, 16%)
as a yellow solid. The solid could also be purified by repeated recrystallization
from DMF followed by NMP.

Fabrication
of Films for Flash-Photolysis (FP) TRMC Measurements
All
of the compounds were coated on quartz substrates (9 ×
40 mm2, 1 mm thick) by melting cast protocols upon heating
to the corresponding isotropic phase.

FP-TRMC Measurements26
Charge-carrier
mobility was evaluated by flash-photolysis time-resolved microwave
conductivity (FP-TRMC) under Ar-saturated conditions at elevated temperature
from 290 to 470 K. Charge carriers were injected into the materials
via photoionization with a third harmonic generation (λ = 355
nm) of a Spectra Physics model INDI-HG Nd:YAG laser, with pulses at
10 Hz with a pulse duration of ca. 5 ns. The photon density of a 355
nm pulse was modulated from (5.2 to 7.3) × 1015 photons
cm–2 pulse–1. The microwave frequency
and power were set at ∼9.1 GHz and 3 mW, respectively, and
guided into a microwave cavity. The Q factor of the microwave cavity
loaded with the sample was 1900 (470 K)–2200 (290 K) depending
on the temperature, and the substrate with the compound films was
placed at the point of the maximum electric field. The reflected power
of the probing microwave, picked up by a diode (rise time <1 ns),
was monitored by a digital oscilloscope (Tektronics TDS3032B) after
amplification by an FET amplifier system (Ciao Electronics CA812-304).
The observed change in the reflected microwave power (ΔPr) was normalized with respect to the steady
reflection of the microwave from the cavity (Pr) and converted directly into the product of a photocarrier
generation yield (ϕ) and the sum of photogenerated electron/hole
mobilities (∑μ)  where e, A, I0, and Flight are the elementary charge, sensitivity
factor (S–1 cm), incident photon density of the
excitation laser (photon cm–2), and filling factor
(cm–1), respectively.
The value of Flight was calculated based
on the overlap of the area of photocarrier injection (presumed to
be proportional to the absorbance of excitation light by the sample
film) with the electric field-strength distribution in the cavity
using CST Microwave Studio from AET Inc.
