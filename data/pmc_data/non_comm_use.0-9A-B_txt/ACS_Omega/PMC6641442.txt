The role of selenium
nanoparticles (Se-NPs) in the mitigation of
high-temperature (HT) stress in crops is not known. The uptake, toxicity
and physiological and biological effects of Se-NPs under HT were investigated
in grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.)
Moench]. Se-NPs of size 10–40 nm were synthesized and characterized
to indicate nanocrystalline structure. A toxicity assay showed that
Se-NPs concentration inducing 50% cell mortality (TC50) was 275 mg
L–1. Translocation study indicated that Se-NPs can
move from root to shoot of sorghum plants. Foliar spray of 10 mg L–1 Se-NPs during the booting stage of sorghum grown
under HT stress stimulated the antioxidant defense system by enhancing
antioxidant enzymes activity. Furthermore, it decreased the concentration
of signature oxidants. Se-NPs facilitated higher levels of unsaturated
phospholipids. Se-NPs under HT stress improved the pollen germination
percentage, leading to a significantly increased seed yield. The increased
antioxidant enzyme activity and decreased content of oxidants in the
presence of Se-NPs were greater under HT (38/28 °C) than under
optimum temperature conditions (32/22 °C). In conclusion, Se-NPs
can protect sorghum plants by enhanced antioxidative defense system
under HT stress.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient for humans, animals,
and other organisms.1 However, in higher
plants, the role of selenium nanoparticles (Se-NPs) has not been demonstrated
clearly. Earlier studies have indicated that soil and/or foliar application
of Se improved the antioxidant capacity [in sweet basil; Ocimum basilicum L.],2 growth [in tobacco; Nicotiana tabacum L.],3 and yield [in mustard; Brassica rapa L.;4 in
potato; Solanum tuberosum L.]5 of higher plants. Decreased lipid peroxidation
and cell membrane damage through increased superoxide dismutase (SOD)
and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) enzymes activity by Se application
explains its antioxidative activity.2,6 The increased
growth in higher plants by Se application is through higher leaf photochemical
efficiency,7 stomatal conductance, carboxylation
efficiency, and content of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase
(Rubisco) enzyme.3

Elemental Se is
not soluble in water and biologically inert because
of its redox state. However, nanosized elemental Se-NPs were found
to possess prominent bioactivity and biosafety properties.8,9 Studies have shown that the biological activity and antioxidant
property of Se-NPs increase with their surface-to-volume ratio and
decreasing particle size.10 Se-NPs have
lower cellular toxicity than selenite or selenomethionine, and possess
the ability to increase the GPX activity, leading to decreased oxidative
stress in mice.11 Similar increase in GPX
and thioredoxin reductase activities with much lower cellular toxicity
by elemental selenium and selenomethionine at nanoscale was reported.8 The underlying paradigm for this study is that
Se-NPs show high biological activity because of interactions between
nanoparticles’ extended surface areas and the functional groups
of peptides.8−12 In tobacco, Se-NPs at a concentration of 50–100 mg kg–1 improved organogenesis and root growth, whereas selenate
completely inhibited both processes, indicating Se-NPs are more effective
and less toxic than bulk selenate particles.13 Our earlier study on sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] demonstrated that foliar application of selenate improved
the leaf antioxidant defense system under high-temperature (HT) stress.14 However, to our knowledge, the role of Se-NPs
on cellular toxicity and antioxidative defense system in plants under
HT stress has not been studied yet. To validate whether Se-NPs possess
antioxidant properties under HT stress, a study was conducted on sorghum
plants challenged with HT stress.

Various abiotic stresses cause
accumulation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) in plants.15 In plants, ROS
include superoxide anion (O2•–), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical
(OH•), singlet oxygen (1O2), and lipid peroxidation free radicals (LOO•,
ROO•), which are highly active and greatly affect
cell membrane stability.15 HO2•/O2•– produced
in plants dismutates either naturally or by the enzyme superoxide
dismutase (SOD) to HO2– and O2. The formed HO2– or its conjugate base,
H2O2, reduces ferric to ferrous or cupric to
cuprous, which later reacts with H2O2/HO2– to generate the hydroxyl radical (OH•) or higher-valent iron and copper cations in Fenton-type
processes.16,17 As a result, plants activate
biosynthesis of antioxidants (glutathione, ascorbate, and tocopherol)
and antioxidant enzymes [SOD, peroxidase (POX), catalase (CAT), ascorbate
peroxidase (APX), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), guaiacol peroxidase,
and glutathione reductase].15 Studies have
highlighted that Se can offset the damaging effects of abiotic stress,
such as drought,18 HT,14 and heavy metals.19 However,
the effect of Se-NPs on HT stress alleviation is not fully understood
and needs attention.

Generally, grain sorghum is grown in the
semiarid regions of the
world for food and nutritional security. The temperature during the sorghum
growing season in the regions of its cultivation is often >35 °C
(daytime maximum temperatures), which is higher than the known optimum
for sorghum growth, development, and yield.20 Further, multiple climate models predict that both mean temperature
and occurrence of short episodes of extreme HT during the crop growing
season will increase in future.21 Climate
model predicts that with an increase of 1 °C in the mean temperature
of sorghum growing season will decline the mean grain yield of sorghum
by about 8–9%.22 Our earlier studies
in sorghum have shown that HT stress causes oxidative damage to pollen
grains, resulting in decreased seed set percentage.23 Furthermore, Se can alleviate HT-induced oxidative stress
by enhancing antioxidant enzyme activities, resulting in delayed leaf
senescence in sorghum.14 Our hypothesis
is that the oxidative stress caused by HT in leaf and pollen grains
of sorghum can be counteracted by Se-NPs through its antioxidant property.
The objectives were to examine the effects of (i) Se-NPs on antioxidant
defense system in leaf exposed to HT stress and (ii) Se-NPs on phospholipids
of leaves, pollen germination, and grain yield of sorghum under HT
stress.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Variation
in Temperatures and Relative Humidity
among the Growth Chambers
The mean temperatures of daytime
maximum and nighttime minimum were ±0.5 °C of the target
day and nighttime temperature in all growth chambers. The relative
humidity was within ±10% of the set value. The performance of
growth chamber was described previously.24 Our previous research showed no statistical difference among the
chambers for growth and yield of spring wheat cultivar Pavon.24 The average plant height was 64.0 ± 0.9
cm, the number of tillers per plant was 3.5 ± 0.1, the number
of spikes per plant was 2.6 ± 0.1, and shoot dry weight was 3.7
± 0.2 g per plant. This indicates that the growth chambers used
have uniform environmental conditions, which was also supported by
the temperature data collected using environmental sensor.

2.2 Morphology and Size of the Synthesized Selenium
Nanoparticles (Se-NPs)
Nanostructure analysis of Se-NPs through
atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) indicates the formation of Se-NPs in a
size range of 10–40 nm (Figure 1a–d). The crystal structures determined by X-ray
diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy are shown in Figure 2a,b, respectively. The diffraction
peaks at 2θ (degrees) of 23.48, 29.73, 41.2, 43.4, 45.18, and
51.49° are indexed as (100), (101), (110), (102), (111), and
(201) planes of Se, respectively. On the basis of the diffraction
peaks, it is clear that the formed Se-NPs are in hexagonal phase with
lattice constants of a = 4.36 Å and c = 4.95 Å, which are in accordance with the reported
JCPDS card No. 06-0362.25 As per the diffraction
peaks, no impurities were detected in the synthesized Se-NPs sample,
and the diffraction peak sharpness indicates that the product is well
crystallized (Figure 2a). The (101) plane showed a stronger peak than the other peaks,
indicating that Se-NPs had preferential growth along the (001) direction.26 The discrete selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) spot indicated a well-crystallized hexagonal selenium crystal.
Correspondingly, the fast Fourier transform of the Se-NPs image is
in virtual agreement with the hexagonal structure. The chemical composition
analysis through the energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) technique confirms pure selenium with no impurities (Figure 1d, inset). The peak
corresponding to Cu and C arises because carbon-coated copper grid
was used for TEM analysis (Figure 1d, inset).

Se. (c) Complete weight loss at around 450 °C indicates sublimation

Figure 2b
shows
a typical Raman scattering spectrum for the Se-NPs, with an intensive
peak at 235 cm–1 due to the Raman scattering of
the A1 mode of hexagonal selenium.27 The
amorphous and monoclinic selenium have Raman resonance absorption
band peak at 264 and 256 cm–1, respectively. Neither
of them are observed in the present study, indicating the absence
of these forms of selenium in the prepared nanoparticle. Two-dimensional
AFM images of the synthesized Se-NPs show individual particles of
size <10 nm, and 3D images show an individual particle with maximum
height of 12 nm in the z direction (Figure 1a,b). The TEM image shows an
individual particle with size between 30 and 60 nm (Figure 1d). The typical SEM image is
shown in Figure 1c,
which demonstrates that these Se-NPs have a width of ∼150 nm
and lengths in the micrometer scale. It is noteworthy that AFM and
TEM images were taken using more diluted samples, compared to the
SEM image. The synthesized Se-NPs have a tendency to aggregate to
rods and then wires of lengths greater than 200 nm.28 The thermal stability of the Se-NPs was studied by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA). During heating, the Se-NPs exhibit weight loss in
two steps when heated to 900 °C (Figure 2c). A weight loss of 5–6% was observed
up to 220 °C, which is most likely due to the evaporation of
volatile matter (mainly adsorbed moisture). Around 450 °C, the
samples showed almost complete weight loss. The explanation of this
finding is the sublimation of the elemental nanoscale Se at this temperature.29

2.3 Cytotoxicity of Se-NPs
on a Murine Cell Line
Cell viabilities after exposure to
Se-NPs are shown in Figure 3b–f. The viability
of the control (0 mg L–1) was set to 100%. Medium
supplemented with Se-NPs at concentrations of 100, 250, and 500 mg
L–1 showed 45, 47, and 58% reduction in cell viabilities,
respectively, compared to the control. The toxicity assay showed that
Se-NPs concentration inducing 50% cell mortality (TC50) was 275 mg
L–1 (based on regression analysis). These results
are in principle agreement with earlier findings using rat dermal
fibroblasts.30 The 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) assay distinguishes normal and apoptotic cells by staining
the nucleus and the condensed chromosome (Figure 3c–f). The nucleus was stained uniformly,
and the margins were clear in the normal cell (0 mg L–1; Figure 3c). However,
in damaged cells, the margin of the nucleus was abnormal and the condensed
chromosome was stained (Figure 3f). Se-NPs at concentrations of 100 and 250 mg L–1 did not damage the fibroblast L929 cell line by more than 50% as
evidenced by regular nucleus margins (Figure 3d,e). However, at 500 mg L–1, the nucleus and cell damage were clearly discernible, which corroborates
the findings with the (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide) (MTT) assay (Figure 3b).

2.4 Translocation of Se-NPs
Figure 3a shows
Se concentrations
in roots and shoots of sorghum plants grown in sand spiked with Se-NPs.
The Se content in roots was significantly higher at 50 and 100 mg
L–1 concentrations of Se-NPs compared to shoots.
The concentrations of Se in the leaves treated with 50 and 100 mg
L–1 of Se-NPs were 1.7 and 3.4 μg g–1, respectively. Similarly, the Se contents in the root of 50 and
100 mg L–1 added Se-NPs were 3.1 and 7.0 μg
g–1, respectively. The control leaf and root had
<0.05 μg g–1 of Se. This suggests that
the sorghum plant is able to translocate Se-NPs from the root to the
shoot. However, the mechanisms underlying these processes are still
not understood. Wang et al.31 observed
the transport of CuO NPs from roots to shoot systems, by the presence
of CuO NPs inside the cell wall epidermis, intercellular space, cortical
cells of the root, and xylem sap exudate. This indicates that CuO
NPS can move intracellularly and extracellularly. After reaching the
xylem, these nanoparticles will be translocated to the shoots along
with the flow of water by transpiration stream.31 A similar mechanism might have occurred for SeNPs. There
is no evidence about biotransformation of SeNPs in plant systems.
However, a study on the potential availability of various forms of
selenium under submerged soil indicates that the availability of elemental
selenium was low due to limited oxidation to selenite or selenate
forms.32 We expect that during normal cell
function the ROS formed through photosynthesis or respiration has
the ability to transform SeNPs to selenite or selanate forms. Similar
uptake and translocation studies on zinc oxide nanoparticles indicate
that ZnNPs transformed to zinc nitrite or zinc acetate in germinated
soybean roots.33

2.5 Effects
of Se-NPs on Physiological Traits
in Sorghum
The chlorophyll index, thylakoid membrane damage,
stomatal conductance, and photosynthetic rate varied significantly
(P ≤ 0.001) between the temperature regimes
(Figure 4a–d).
Irrespective of the Se-NPs spray, HT stress decreased chlorophyll
content (16%), stomatal conductance (22%), and photosynthetic rate
(17%) and increased thylakoid membrane damage (68%) compared to optimum
temperature (OT, Figure 5a–d). Chlorophyll biosynthesis enzymes are bound to the chloroplastic
membranes, and the damage of thylakoids under HT stress leads to chlorophyll
loss.34,35 Increase of the thylakoid membrane damage
under HT stress is consistent with membrane leakiness. For both temperature
ranges, Se-NPs spray marginally (<2%) increased the chlorophyll
content, stomatal conductance, and photosynthetic rate (Figure 4a,c,d). However, the thylakoid
membrane damage was decreased by 18% compared to the unsprayed control
(Figure 4b), which
indicates that Se-NPs protected the thylakoid membrane by restoration
of the chloroplast ultrastructure through distribution of thylakoid
membranes and granal stacking.36

the mean ± SE of eight independent measurements (four replications
and two experiments). Means with different letters are significantly
different at P ≤ 0.05.

9 days of HT stress, and its yield and components were recorded at
maturity. Each value is the mean ± SE of eight independent measurements
(four replications and two experiments). Means with different letters
are significantly different at P ≤ 0.05.

2.6 Effects
of Se-NPs on the Content of Oxidants,
MDA, and Membrane Damage
High-temperature stress caused significant
(P ≤ 0.001) increase in O2•– and H2O2 contents, MDA
formation, and membrane damage than OT (Figure 4e–h). HT stress increased O2•– and H2O2 contents
by 110 and 88%, respectively, compared to OT (Figure 4e,f). Similarly, HT stress increased the
MDA and cell membrane damage by 144 and 152%, respectively, over OT
(Figure 4g,h). A damaged
thylakoid membrane can decrease the electron transport rate, leading
to the formation of ROS.37 Application
of Se-NPs significantly (P ≤ 0.001) reduced
superoxide radical, hydrogen peroxide, MDA, and membrane damage by
25, 25, 30, and 18%, respectively, compared to the untreated control
(Figure 4e–h).
There was a significant interaction between temperature and Se-NPs
application for O2•–, H2O2, MDA, and membrane damage (Figure 4e–h). Application of Se-NPs decreased
O2•–, H2O2, MDA, and membrane damage by 29, 38, 39, and 25% under HT stress
(Figure 4e–h).
The decreased O2•– levels under
Se treatment could be due to the spontaneous dismutation of superoxide
radical to hydrogen peroxide,38 the direct
quenching of superoxide radical and hydroxyl radical by Se nanoparticles
and/or selenoenzymes,8,39 or the activation of the antioxidant
defense system.14 Selenium cannot directly
scavenge H2O2; however, it can activate H2O2 quenchers (GPX, CAT, POX, and APX), leading
to decreased H2O2 content.14 The level of MDA under HT stress is an indicator of cell
membrane damage. Se-NPs spray decreased MDA production in both OT
and HT; however, greater reduction was observed under HT (Figure 4g). This indicates
that Se-NPs can act as an antioxidant under HT stress.6,14

2.7 Effects of Se-NPs on the Activity of Antioxidant
Enzymes
Overall, HT stress significantly (P ≤ 0.001) decreased SOD (38%), CAT (37%), POX (38%), and GPX
(28%) enzyme activity compared to OT (Figure 5a–d). It has been suggested that under
HT stress the acquisition of tolerance is closely related to ROS removal.
This study demonstrated that HT stress doubled the production of ROS,
which may surpass the antioxidant defense capability, resulting in
enzyme inactivation or impairment. Foliar spray of Se-NPs significantly
(P ≤ 0.001) increased SOD, CAT, POX, and GPX
by 22, 24, 11, and 9%, respectively, compared to the unsprayed control
(Figure 5a–d).
Significant interaction (P ≤ 0.001) between
temperature and Se-NPs application was observed for SOD, CAT, POX,
and GPX activity. This was because Se-NPs application increased the
enzyme activity only under HT stress. Foliar spray of Se-NPs improved
the antioxidant defense system under HT, which was demonstrated by
diminished ROS levels and MDA production (Figure 4e–h). Earlier studies have demonstrated
the antioxidant role of Se against the ROS through enhanced antioxidant
enzyme (SOD, CAT, POX, and GPX) activity and decreased ROS content.6,14,19,39

2.8 Phospholipid Signatures
The total
amounts of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and phosphatidylinositol
(PI) were significantly (P ≤ 0.05) decreased
under HT stress (Table 1). Furthermore, the amounts of the polyunsaturated acyl species 36:6
of MGDG and PI were significantly (P ≤ 0.05)
decreased during HT stress (Figure 6a,b; Table 2). Similarly, the 34:5, 36:5, and 38:5 acyl species of MGDG
and 34:2, 36:4, 36:5, and 36:3 acyl species of PI were significantly
(P ≤ 0.05) decreased (Figure 6a; Table 2). The galactolipids (MGDG and digalactosyldiacylgylcerol
(DGDG)) represent 70–80% of the thylakoid lipid matrix, and
the decrease in the MGDG content under HT stress indicates that the
thylakoid membrane was damaged under HT stress. The decreased levels
of unsaturated acyl species indicate that HT stress decreases desaturase
enzyme activity.40

molecular species contents in grain sorghum leaves on 9 days of HT
stress. Each value is the mean ± SE of eight independent measurements
(four replications and two experiments). Means with different letters
are significantly different at P ≤ 0.05.

were represented as mean ± SEM.

Foliar spray of Se-NPs caused significant (P ≤
0.05) increase in total phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylglycerol
(PG) contents (Table 1). The 34:2, 36:3, and 36:4 species of PC were significantly (P ≤ 0.05) increased by Se-NPs spray compared to unsprayed
control (Figure 6c; Table 2). Similarly, the
34:2, 34:3, and 36:5 species of PG were significantly (P ≤ 0.05) increased (Figure 6d). PC forms a bilayer structure of the membrane, and
the high level of choline in the polar head makes the membrane more
fluid.41 It seems that Se-NPs under HT
stress maintains the lipid bilayer and fluidity. Phosphatidylglycerol
is a major phospholipid of thylakoid membranes and considered to be
important for the development of the chloroplast. The elevated PG
levels in plants sprayed with Se-NPs indicate that the functionality
of chloroplast was maintained under HT stress.

2.9 Pollen
Germination, Seed Set, Seed Size, and
Seed Yield
High-temperature stress significantly (P ≤ 0.001) decreased the pollen germination percentage,
seed set percentage, and seed yield (Figure 5e–h) by 23, 32, and 27%, respectively,
compared to OT. Previous studies have indicated that HT stress can
decrease pollen germination percentage in sorghum by affecting the
pollen or ovule viability and/or stigma receptivity.23,42,43 Reduced seed set percentage under
HT stress was a consequence of the reduced pollen germination percentage,
leading to decreased grain yield because there is no significant difference
in seed size. Application of Se-NPs significantly (P ≤ 0.001) increased the pollen germination percentage (6%),
seed set percentage (7%), and seed yield (11%) under HT stress compared
to unsprayed control (Figure 5e–h). There were significant (P ≤
0.001) interactions of temperature by Se-NPs application for pollen
germination percentage, seed set percentage, and seed yield (Figure 5e–h). Application
of Se-NPs increased pollen germination percentage, seed set percentage,
and seed yield by 14, 19, and 26%, respectively, under HT stress conditions
(Figure 5e–h).
A previous study on Brassica juncea indicated no reduction of pollen germination percentage after Se
(370 mg Se kg–1) application.44 Under HT stress, Se-NPs improved the pollen germination
percentage. The exact mechanism of the pollen germination improvement
is not known and needs to be studied. However, we hypothesize that
the elevated ROS production under HT stress in the pollen grains may
be quenched effectively by Se-NPs, leading to increased pollen viability.
The observed increase in the seed yield of plants sprayed with Se-NPs
was a consequence of increased photosynthetic rate and seed number
per panicle. This was accomplished by decreased ROS content in the
leaves along with higher antioxidant enzyme activities.

3 Conclusions
Se-NPs were synthesized using sodium selenate
as molecular precursor
and ascorbic acid as the reducing agent. The size of the synthesized
Se-NPs was <100 nm. A toxicity assay using a murine fibroblast
cell line showed that Se-NPs had a TC50 value of 275 mg L–1. Our experiments provided evidence that the physiological response
of sorghum to Se-NPs was generally greater under HT stress. On the
basis of this evidence, we have concluded that Se-NPs are an HT stress
protectant in sorghum. Furthermore, this study has affirmed, for the
first time, that Se-NPs foliar spray under HT stress improved the
antioxidant defense system in sorghum. The integrity and composition
of the thylakoid membrane were maintained by Se-NPs, as revealed by
the observed phospholipid signature. The response of pollen functions
to Se-NPs proved that it is not toxic. To expand our understanding
of the action of Se-NPs in plants, the complete Se-NPs metabolism
has to be studied. This endeavor will require detailed biochemical
and physiological investigations, as well as the study of the genes
involved in the uptake, transport, and assimilation of Se-NPs.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Synthesis of Se-NPs
The Se-NPs were
synthesized according to Bai et al.45 with
little modification. Solutions (100 mL) of ascorbic acid (5 mM) and
sodium selenate (5 mM) in bidest·H2O were prepared
separately in 250 mL conical flasks. Elemental nanoselenium was prepared
by adding ascorbic acid dropwise to the sodium selenate solution at
40 °C under magnetic stirring (90 rpm). The addition of ascorbic
acid was stopped when the solution turned from colorless to orange/red.
The formed Se-NPs were washed with water, followed by ethanol for
four times by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 20 min. After centrifugation,
the Se-NPs were dried at 50 °C for 24 h.

4.2 Material
Characterization
The morphologies
and microstructures of the prepared material were studied by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM, Quanta 250, 30 kV, FEI, Czech Republic)
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai Spirit G2, 120 kV,
The Netherlands), respectively. For SEM and TEM experiments, accelerating
voltages of 10 and 120 kV were used, respectively. Surface topography
height images were acquired by multimode scanning probe microscopy
(NTMDT-NTEGRA, Russia) under ambient conditions (25 ± 2 °C)
using a semi-contact-mode probe. High-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM) measurements were obtained with an acceleration
voltage of 200 kV (JOEL JEM 2100, Japan). Selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy of the Se-NPs were
also performed using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope.
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out using a diffractometer
(Rigaku Ultima IV XRD, Tokyo, Japan) in the 2θ range of 5–90°
utilizing Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 30 mA, and λ = 1.5405
Å), with a scan speed of 5° min–1. Crystallinity
of the sample was obtained through the crystalline–amorphous
peak deconvolution process using a Gaussian function. Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) of the samples were performed using a PerkinElmer STA
600 instrument.

4.3 Toxicity Assay
At present, nanomaterials
are used in various fields of science, and the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) recommends to analyze the safety
of nanomaterials before their application. Hence, the synthesized
SeNPs were tested against mouse (a vertebrate) cell line to show their
safety to humans. The mouse fibroblast L929 cell line was procured
from ATCC, India, and maintained in a culture medium containing 10%
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, fetal bovine serum
(10% v/v), penicillin (100 units mL–1), and streptomycin
(100 mg mL–1). The cells were kept in a humidified
atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The viability of
the cells was estimated by the standard 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay, (HiMedia Laboratories, Mumbai, India) with and
without supplementation of Se-NPs.46,47 The cell viability
was calculated as the ratio of optical density of the Se-NP-treated
cells to optical density of the control wells (above-mentioned culture
medium with cells) and expressed in percentage. For DAPI staining,
the L929 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5 × 103 cells per well) and cultured to adhere overnight, after which different
concentrations of Se-NPs (0, 100, 250, and 500 mg L–1) were added and left for 48 h. After completion of the reaction,
the cells were washed and fixed using phosphate-buffered saline and
70% ethanol, respectively. Then, the cells were stained with 2.0 mg
L–1 DAPI for 15 min and viewed under an inverted
fluorescence microscope (Nikon Ti-S Eclipse, Japan). The image shown
is representative of 10 randomly observed fields.

4.4 Uptake Pattern of Se-NPs in Plants
River sand was collected,
dried in air, and sieved using a 2 mm sieve
(sieve number 10). The >2 mm fraction that does not pass through
the
sieve was collected and set aside. The collected soil fraction (<2
mm) was sieved again using a 1 mm sieve (sieve number 20). The fraction
that did not pass through the sieve (very coarse sand) was collected
and soaked in aqua regia (3:1 HCl/HNO3 acid ratio, 10 mL
per gram of sand) for 1 day and then washed thoroughly four times
with double-distilled water. Afterward, this soil was dried in air
for 48 h and used for the uptake experiments described here. Seeds
of sorghum var. CO 30 were sown in aqua regia-washed sand and germinated
at 25 °C in a growth chamber. After emergence of the seedlings,
plastic pots (10 × 6 × 15 cm3) bearing 100 g
of soil were moved to open sunlight. The seedlings were irrigated
with the one-quarter-strength Hoagland solution for the first 2 weeks.
Thinning was done when the plants were about 8 cm high by leaving
one plant per pot. Thereafter, the pot was irrigated with either the
one-quarter-strength Hoagland solution or the one-quarter-strength
Hoagland solution containing 50 or 100 mg L–1 Se-NPs.
The seedlings irrigated with only Hoagland solution served as control.
Every day, the pot was irrigated with 5 mL of the above solution.
The seedlings were maintained for 10 days and then the plants were
uprooted with minimal damage to their roots. The uprooted seedlings
were dried in an oven at 40 °C for 72 h. Then, the roots and
shoots were removed and their Se content was determined using inductively
coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, PerkinElmer
optima, OPTIMA 2000 DV, Waltham, MA) following an established procedure.48

4.5 Effects of Foliar Spray
of Se-NPs on HT-Stressed
Sorghum Plants
4.5.1 Plant Husbandry and Growth
Conditions
Controlled environment experiments using the facilities
at the
Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University (Manhattan, KS), were
conducted to quantify the effect of foliar spray of Se-NPs on HT-stressed
sorghum plants. The sorghum genotype DK 28-E was used in this study.
The details of plant husbandry are available elsewhere.42 Plants were grown from sowing to booting stage
(10 days prior to start of panicle exertion) in the growth chamber
(Conviron Model CMP 3244, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada) maintained at
daytime maximum and nighttime minimum temperatures of 32 and 22 °C.
The photon flux density in the growth chamber at the top of the plant
canopy was maintained at 800–1000 μmol m–1 s–1 using supplemental fluorescent lights. At
booting stage, 10 pots were moved to each growth chamber maintained
at optimum temperature (OT, 32/22 °C) or HT (38/28 °C) for
treatment imposition. Before moving the sorghum plants in each growth
chamber (OT or HT), they were sprayed with either water or a solution
containing 10 mg of Se-NPs per liter of water using a hand sprayer
(1.5 L capacity, compressed air type, Hummert International, Earth
City, MO). The Se-NPs solutions were prepared by dispersing the required
amount of Se-NPs in water using a sonicator to completely disperse
the nanoparticles. To each pot, about 25 mL of Se-NPs suspension was
sprayed on the plants. Water-sprayed plants served as control. Thereafter,
plants were kept under the respective temperature conditions (OT or
HT) for 10 days. Daytime maximum and nighttime minimum temperatures
were maintained for 4 h each, with an 8 h transition period between
them, and vice versa. The photoperiod was 16 h, and the photon flux
density was 920 μmol m–2 s–1 at the top of the plant canopy, provided by cool fluorescent lamps.
The growth chamber relative humidity was set at 85%. In all of the
growth chambers, the air temperature and relative humidity were continuously
monitored at 20 min intervals throughout the experiment. After 10
days, all pots were returned to the growth chambers and maintained
at OT until maturity. The whole experiment was repeated (same growth
conditions, etc.) once.

4.5.2 Leaf Physiological Traits
The chlorophyll
index, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and gas exchange
were recorded on attached, fully expanded flag leaves of four different
tagged plants from each temperature treatment on day 9 of the HT stress
treatment at midday (between 1000 and 1400 h), as described in Prasad
et al.42

4.5.3 Oxidants
Content, MDA Content, and Membrane
Damage
Superoxide anion accumulation was estimated according
to Chaitanya and Naithani49 and expressed
as change in optical density in min–1 g–1 on fresh weight basis. The hydrogen peroxide content in the leaves
was quantified using a molecular probe (Amplex Red hydrogen peroxide/peroxidase
assay kit; Invitrogen Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR, product
number A22188), which is a one-step assay that uses the Amplex Red
reagent, in combination with horseradish peroxidase (HRP), to detect
H2O2, and expressed in nmol g–1 on fresh weight basis.50 The malondialdehyde
content in leaves was quantified using an OxiSelect thiobarbituric
acid-reactive substances assay kit (Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA; product
number STA 330) and expressed in μmol per gram of leaf tissue
on fresh weight basis.51 Cell membrane
damage was quantified as leakage of ions from the leaf, as explained
by Sairam et al.,52 and expressed in percentage.

4.5.4 Antioxidant Enzyme Activities
The
extraction of various antioxidant enzymes was done in Tris–HCl
buffer, as described by Djanaguiraman et al.14 Total superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was measured in the supernatant
with a superoxide dismutase assay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor,
Michigan; product number 706002) according to the manufacturer’s
instruction and expressed in enzyme units. One unit of SOD is defined
as the amount of enzyme needed to obtain 50% dismutation of superoxide
radicals on a fresh weight basis.53 Catalase
(CAT) enzyme activity was measured using the Amplex Red catalase assay
kit (Molecular probes, Invitrogen, Inc., Eugene, OR; product number
A22180) and expressed in enzyme units. One enzyme unit was defined
as the amount of catalase enzyme that decomposes 1.0 μmol of
H2O2 min–1 g–1 of tissue on fresh weight basis at 25 °C.54 The peroxidase (POX) enzyme activity was measured using
the Amplex Red hydrogen peroxide/peroxidase assay kit (Molecular Probes,
Invitrogen, Inc., Eugene, OR; product number A22188). The POX enzymatic
activity was determined following the same procedure as for the determination
of H2O2, except that the Amplex Red reagent
contained 2 mmol H2O2 instead of HRP. The result
was expressed in enzyme units as previously described.55 One enzyme unit is defined as the amount of
enzyme that will form 1.0 mg of purpurogallin from pyrogallol in 20
s at pH 6.0 and 20 °C on fresh weight basis. Glutathione peroxidase
enzyme (GPX) was assayed using the Cayman’s GPX assay kit (Cayman
Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, product number 703102) according to the manufacturer
instructions and expressed in enzyme units. One unit is defined as
the amount of enzyme that will cause the oxidation of 1 nmol of NADPH
to NADP+ min–1 on fresh weight basis.56

4.5.5 Electrospray Ionization
Tandem Mass Spectrometry
Lipid Profiling in Leaves
At each temperature regime on the
9th day of HT stress conditions, the flag leaf was collected between
10:00 and 11:00 h and processed for lipid profiling, as described
by Vu et al.57 and Xiao et al.58

4.5.6 Pollen Germination, Seed
Set Percentage,
Seed Size, and Seed Yield
Pollen grains were collected at
the time of anthesis and germinated in solid medium to estimate pollen
germination percentage according to Djanaguiraman et al.23 The tagged panicles were harvested at physiological
maturity, dried at 40 °C for 7 days, and hand-threshed. The seed
set percentage, seed size, and seed yield were quantified according
to the methods of Prasad et al.42 and Djanaguiraman
et al.23

4.6 Data
Analyses
Statistical analyses
were performed using SAS program. The uptake pattern of the Se-NPs
experiment was conducted in randomized complete block design. The
Se-NPs foliar spray experiment was conducted in split-plot design
with temperature and Se application as the main plot and subplot,
respectively. The plants were selected randomly for treatments and
arranged randomly within the growth chambers. Furthermore, the temperatures
were randomly assigned to growth chambers. Observations were analyzed
using the PROC GLM procedure of SAS. The results of both experiments
were analyzed separately and in combination. Similar responses and
significance were obtained for most traits. Therefore, mean responses
for two combined experiments are presented. The standard error was
shown as an estimate of variability, and means of various variables
were separated for significance by the LSD test at a probability level
of 0.05. For lipid analysis, statistical significance was set at P ≤ 0.05 after appropriate corrections for false
lipid assignments. Comparisons were always made between the HT stress
samples and their controls.
