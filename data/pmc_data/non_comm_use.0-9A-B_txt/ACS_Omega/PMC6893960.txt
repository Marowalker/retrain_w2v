1 Introduction
As
a substitute for conventional fossil fuels in electricity generation,
coalbed gas (CBG) seems a promising solution for the energy crisis.1 The estimated world CBG resources buried above
2000 m are around 240 Tm3 and China has 36.8 Tm3, ranking the third largest in the world after Russia and Canada.2,3 On the other hand, the accumulation of CBG in underground coal mines
continues to be a hidden danger, threatening miners’ safety.
Chinese State Administration of Coal Mine Safety stipulates the gas
content of 8 m3/t in coalbed as the critical value of coal
and gas outbursts.4 Thus, measuring the
content of gas in place (GIP) is a crucial step not only for CBG resource
estimation and exploitation, but also in evaluating the potential
severity of gas disasters in new mines or in unmined areas of existing
mines.

The underground direct measurement method of gas content,
mainly
developed by Bertard and Kissell et al.,5,6 is widely applied
both in the United States and China. In the method, the total gas
content of coal samples is subdivided into three parts: lost gas,
measured desorbed gas from drill cuttings or coal sample, and residual
gas desorbed from crushed coal in the lab.7,8 Among
them, the lost gas is defined as the portion seeping from samples
during their collection prior to being sealed into an airtight desorption
canister, and thus cannot be measured directly. Despite the square-root-time
method based on the work of Barrer always being recommended for the
lost gas estimation,9−11 its accuracy is greatly affected by the sampling
strategies.

Collection drill cuttings from test boreholes is
the simplest way
to obtain coal samples in GIP, but these cuttings are generally mixed
and too crushed, accelerating gas desorption before being sealed into
canisters.12 As a result, the gas contents
evaluated by adopting drill cuttings should be considered as the minimum
values. To solve the problem, a coring tube is recommended to collect
intact samples in the preset place.6,8 Unfortunately,
a fatal shortcoming is that the friction heat generated between the
tube and hole wall accelerates gas transport from the samples due
to increased gas kinetics,13 which results
in a serious underestimation of the true loss content with the  method,
especially within a long exposure
time. The results of heat distribution of twist drill pipes in rock
drilling show that the endothermal coefficient of a workpiece has
an effect on drilling temperature, and the most cutting energy will
be converted into cutting heat, causing the temperature of the drill
bit to rise rapidly.14−17 Friction heat can raise the bit temperature to about 500 °C,
and the instantaneous temperature reaches 1000 °C. Devries18 considered the blockage of cuttings discharge
as the main cause of temperature rise of drill tools, which is also
affected by the lithology of the drilling site. Besides that, for
a certain rotating speed of drill tools, the reduction of propelling
speed will prolong the sampling time, inducing an increase in heat
production.19,20 The similar situations happen
in lunar soil drilling. The conditions of vacuum and solar radiation
make the drill bit reach a high temperature, and that can ruin the
lunar samples.21 Wireline coring originated
from oil drilling can quickly take out coal samples from the borehole
bottom by winch hoisting, which greatly shortens the core-taking time.22 Nevertheless, if the depression angle of the
borehole is not large enough, the salvager is hardly delivered to
the bottom by its own weight. It also needs water to be pressed in
and the operation is complicated. Hence, wireline coring is preferable
in the reservoir geological exploration, but not for the underground
gas content determination in the in-seam or upward cross-strata boreholes.
Other coring methods (e.g., ejector sampling or reverse circulation
drilling) create excessive or negative pressure conditions, differing
from gas desorption in atmospheric pressure, and hence, also cause
errors in the lost gas estimation.23,24

The
reduction of gas desorption capacity and kinetics by cooling
coal samples is probably a feasible way to improve the accuracy of
lost gas estimation. Hence, the authors have proposed a freezing coring
technology25 for gas content determination.
Isothermal adsorption/desorption tests under low temperatures25−27 demonstrate that gas diffusion in the coal matrix is greatly inhibited,
whereas the adsorption capacity enhanced below 273.15 K, and the mean
isosteric adsorption heat can be used to evaluate the gas adsorption
affinity of coal with different metamorphic ranks. In addition, the
applications of artificial freezing technology in other related fields,
such as sampling the frozen sediment from ice-covered lake,28 subsurface spawning gravel under shallow water,29 and land hydrates30,31 in particular,
can also provide a reference for us. It is a priority to find a suitable
refrigeration mode served in the underground coalbed sampling with
the advantages of stable physical properties, no danger, rapid cooling
performance, and long-running preservation of low temperature. In
our study, based on the precalculation of the cryogen (dry ice) dose,
the freezing tests of coking coal were conducted at different equilibrium
pressures of gas adsorption to investigate the cooling performances
of four kinds of refrigeration modes. The temperature and pressure
evolvement in coal was monitored during the cooling and heating process,
and the reasons behind these phenomena are also discussed. It provides
a basis for the design and development of the freezing coring device
used in the GIP evaluation.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Temperature Evolvement of Coal by Different
Freezing Modes
2.1.1 Cooling Performance
In order to
achieve an optimal refrigeration effect in a short time, coal freezing
tests by injecting different doses of ethanol (0, 200, 400, and 600
mL) as catalyst were conducted. The dry ice amount of 2 kg was adopted
according to the calculation results and the molded coal samples without
gas sorption were first selected here. The temperature variation caused
by the Joule–Thomson effect27 can
be neglected during the freezing test due to the large volume of the
coal sample. The ambient temperature was kept 26 ± 2 °C.

Figure 1a–d
shows that the temperature evolvement of the coal sample under different
refrigeration modes presents a similar trend, which can be divided
into three stages: rapid cooling in the early stage, low-temperature
preservation in the mid-stage, and slow rising in the later stage.
In the early stage, temperatures both of the coal center and the sidewall
decrease fast, and the average cooling rates of the coal center gradually
accelerate with the increased dose of injected ethanol (see Table 1), which are 0.34,
0.42, 0.51, and 0.66 °C/min, respectively. For a regular amount
of refrigeration, the increase of ethanol would promote more sublimation
of dry ice, and thus accelerate the cooling rate in the early stage.
Meanwhile, more dry ice is consumed with the increased ethanol injection,
so that the low temperature preservation time (<0 °C) gets
shorter and shorter: 548, 538, 454, and 409 min, respectively. The
four refrigeration modes all can satisfy the time requirements of
freezing coring from the perspective of low temperature duration.
However, the mode by adding 600 mL ethanol as the catalyst can freeze
the coal sample to −40 °C in the shortest time, thereby
inhibiting gas desorption as little as possible from coal during the
freezing coring process.

refrigeration modes:

and (d) dry ice + 600 mL ethanol.

2.1.2 Heat Transfer Model
A heat transfer
model throughout the cooling and heating process was established with
COMSOL multiphysics to explore the temperature distribution at each
point in the coal sample. The refrigeration tank and coal canister
are from the outside to the inside of the model, and the top and bottom
surfaces are heat insulation. Coal is regarded as an isotropic material,
and its thermal properties are replaced by equivalent thermal parameters.
The heat of methane adsorption is neglected in the model. Thus, heat
transfer can be described by the following equation. 1  where ρ is coal density; Cp is the specific heat capacity; k is the thermal
conductivity coefficient; v is the flow velocity
of gas; ∇T is the temperature
gradient; and Q is the heat-transfer capacity per
volume. The thermal conductivity coefficient of coal can be expressed
as follow36 2  

The gas flow in the gap between the
sample canister and coal is regarded as the nonisothermal flow of
incompressible fluid, so the governing equations are shown as follows 3   4  where ρg is gas density, ; M is the molar mass of
gas; R is the gas constant, 8.314 J/(mol·K);
μ is the gas kinetic viscosity; and ∇P is the gas pressure gradient.

The refrigeration mode of 2
kg dry ice with 600 mL ethanol catalysis
is taken here to show the evolution rules of coal temperature (Figure 2). The relationship
between coal temperature and time can be fitted by the polynomial
function (eq 5) as the
heat boundary condition. 5  Initial condition: T|t=0 = T0 = 300.15
K.

Figure 2 Temperature distribution in the canister at different cooling stages:
(a) 6, (b) 28, (c) 80, and (d) 367 min.

Both the experimental and the modeling results indicate that the
coal sample is frozen from the outside to the inside, and the temperature
of the sidewall is lower than that of the coal center in the initial
cooling stage. When the temperature of the coal center drops to the
lowest, the heat exchange between the whole refrigeration system is
in a transient dynamic equilibrium state. Although with further consumption
of dry ice in the later stage, the sample temperature slowly rises
again, but the rising rate of the sidewall is slightly higher than
that of the coal core. It is mainly attributed to the difference of
thermal conductivity between the canister sidewall and coal center.
The thermal conductivity of the sidewall is approximate to that of
stainless steel, 40 W/m·K, but coal is a poor conductor with
the thermal conductivity of about 0.25 W/m·K. The difference
of thermal conductivity will affect the rate of heat transfer. The
higher the thermal conductivity, the faster the heat transfer. Additionally,
the canister sidewall is the earliest to exchange heat with the ambient,
and then the heat transfer is from the sidewall to the center mainly
by means of heat conduction. Therefore, both the cooling and heating
rate of the sidewall are higher than that of the coal center at the
same time.

2.2 Temperature Evolvement
of Coal Containing
Gas
Disturbed coal seams in China are generally developed
by multistage tectonic movements, and thus, the pore structure of
tectonic coal is very complex. A large amount of gas is adsorbed in
disturbed coal. To study the influence of gas adsorption on the freezing
performance of the coal sample, coal freezing tests, when charging
different amounts of methane (the initial adsorption equilibrium pressure:
0, 1.09, and 2.15 MPa) were conducted at 23 °C ambient temperature.
The refrigeration mode of 2 kg dry ice and injecting 600 mL ethanol
were taken. The results are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Temperature evolvement of coal center when charging
gas.

Figure 3 shows that
in the early freezing stage, the average cooling rates of the coal
sample accelerate with the increase of the equilibrium pressure of
gas adsorption under the same conditions. When the temperature drops
to 0 °C, the cooling time of the coal center under different
gas pressures is 29, 14, and 10 min, respectively, and the cooling
rates are 0.79, 1.64 and 2.3 °C/min, respectively. When the temperature
drops to −30 °C, the cooling time of the coal center is
65, 58, and 48 min, respectively, and the cooling rates are 0.81,
0.91, and 1.1 °C/min, respectively (Table 2). In addition, the low temperature preservation
time (below 0 °C) of the coal sample is prolonged by charging
gas with a higher pressure, and it lasts for 409, 495, and 558 min,
respectively, at 0, 1.09, and 2.15 MPa. It indicates that when coal
fully adsorbs gas, the absorbed gas contributes to improve the refrigeration
efficiency and the low temperature preservation time can also completely
satisfy the requirements of underground freezing coring.

Based on the theories of thermodynamics
and gas kinetics, gas pressure
is the interaction between gas molecules and the walls of the coal
container. Coal is a poor conductor of heat with low thermal conductivity.
However, after charging high-pressure gas, the adsorption system contains
more gas molecules at the same ambient temperature. The increasing
gas density makes the occurrence of gas molecules at the same place
nearly equal, which weakens the difference in the kinetic energy of
gas molecules caused by the temperature difference. Thus, the overall
heat conductivity of coal containing gas is greater than that of coal
without gas, resulting in the cooling rate increasing with gas pressure.
Although the heat conductivity of coal is not constant, and it decreases
with cooling.37−39 It reveals why the cooling rate is very fast in the
initial freezing stage and then gradually decreases to the thermodynamic
equilibrium state. Besides, the absorbed gas also provides a carrier
for the system to absorb more cold energy, which makes the temperature
of the coal center rise more slowly in the pick-up stage, and the
re-desorbed gas also absorbs some heat. Consequently, the low temperature
preservation time of coal containing high-pressure gas becomes longer
than that of coal with no gas absorbed.

2.3 Response
Characteristics of Gas Pressure to
Temperature
2.3.1 Gas Pressure Evolvement
The gas
pressures in the freezing tests of coal containing gas were monitored.
The initial adsorption equilibrium pressures in the coal canister
are 1.09 and 2.15 MPa, and the ambient temperature was 23 °C.
The results of pressure variation are shown in Figure 4a,b.

Figure 4 Variation of gas pressure during the cooling
and heating processes:
(a) initial equilibrium pressure of 1.09 MPa, (b) initial equilibrium
pressure of 2.15 MPa.

Figure 4a,b displays
that the pressure variation in the coal canister is closely consistent
with the temperature evolvement of the coal center. In the early stage,
the gas pressure rapidly decreases with the cooling and finally tends
to be stable for a while, which can be regarded as the end of cooling.
The initial gas pressures of 1.09 and 2.15 MPa would reach the new
adsorption equilibrium states of 0.52 and 1.25 MPa, respectively,
at the lowest temperature of −40 °C. Subsequently, the
coal temperature gradually rises again with the depletion of dry ice,
and finally keeps the same with the ambient temperature. The gas pressure
in the coal canister also picks up and eventually approaches the initial
equilibrium pressure. The above results show that the processes of
adsorption and desorption are basically reversible. Cooling can reduce
the kinetic energy of gas molecules. When the molecular kinetic energy
is lower than the adsorption barrier, the gas molecule is adsorbed
on the coal surface. Conversely, heating accelerates the thermal movement
of gas molecules, which frees the adsorbed gas molecules from the
bondage of van der Waals force to diffuse from the surface of the
coal matrix. This is the main reason why the pressure in the coal
canister varies with the ambient temperature.

2.3.2 Desorption Hysteresis
Figure 5 shows that there
is an obvious linear relationship between gas pressure and temperature
of the coal sample below −10 °C. Whereas the gas pressures
during cooling appear to cross the data during heating process in
the range of 1.25–1.325 MPa in Figure 5b. It may be because for the whole refrigeration
system, the ambient temperature changes all the time. When the coal
temperature drops to the lowest, the heat exchange between the whole
refrigeration system is in a transient dynamic equilibrium state.
However, the adsorption of gas molecules on the coal surface never
stops till equilibrium. Thus, the gas pressure drops sharply and does
not keep the linear relation in the range of 1.25–1.325 MPa.
Besides, the pressure at each temperature during cooling is higher
than that during heating. It is mainly because, at the same temperature,
the gas adsorption capacity of coal during cooling is less than that
during heating. Some methane molecules adsorbed on the surface of
the coal matrix during cooling cannot be desorbed from coal pores
when heating to the same temperature, which is the desorption hysteresis.39

Figure 5 Relation between gas pressure and temperature below −10
°C: (a) initial equilibrium pressure of 1.09 MPa, (b) initial
equilibrium pressure of 2.15 MPa.

The descent trend of the initial pressure of 1.09 MPa during cooling
can be fitted as follows: P = 0.0082T + 0.8558 (R2 = 0.999), whereas the ascent
curve during heating is P = 0.0078T + 0.8309 (R2 = 0.996). For the initial
pressure of 2.15 MPa, the pressure descent curve during cooling is
fitted as follows: P = 0.0126T +
1.7871 (R2 = 0.990), whereas the ascent
curve during heating is P = 0.0119T + 1.7179 (R2 = 0.999). Here, the hysteresis coefficient, Hc is defined as the difference between the intercepts
of descent and ascent lines. Thus, Hc at
different initial pressures is 0.0249 and 0.0692 MPa.

To investigate
the contributing factors of desorption hysteresis,
the pore structures of the coking coal samples were analyzed by the
ASAP-2020 specific surface area analyzer (see Table 3). Based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) theory, the total specific surface area of coal ranges from
0.5319 to 8.098 m2/g (avg. 2.773), and micropores take
up the largest proportion (70.36%), followed by mesopores (26.07%)
and macropores (3.57%). The pore volume varies from 0.0016 to 0.0247
cm3/g (avg. 0.012) and is mainly dominated by mesopores
and macropores, taking up 46.85 and 34.42%, respectively. Furthermore,
the liquid N2 adsorption/desorption results (Figure 6) indicate that when the partial
pressure is greater than 0.8, the adsorption quantity of N2 rises sharply, which means that the monolayer adsorption ends and
the multilayer adsorption occurs, associated with capillary condensation.40,41 At the partial pressure of 0.50, a sudden yield point appears in
the desorption isotherms, corresponding to a hysteresis loop. It is
mainly caused by various ink-bottle type and narrow-slit pores, which
are beneficial for gas adsorption, but bad for seepage.

Figure 6 Liquid N2 adsorption/desorption results for the coking
coal.

Table 3 Distribution of the
Specific Surface
Area and Pore Volume of Coal
pore size/nm	specific surface
area (BET)/m2·g–1	proportion/%	pore volume/cm3.g–1	proportion/%

mesopore (10–100)	0.723	26.07	0.006	46.85	
macropore (>100)	0.099	3.57	0.004	34.42	
total	2.773	100	0.012	100	
To
date, it is widely accepted that the pore structure of coal
is heterogeneous, and the desorption hysteresis has been attributed
to the ink-bottle type pore structure with narrow pore throats, which
are smaller than the kinetic diameters of methane.42,43 These constricted micropores in the coking coal provide the main
storage space for gas.44 When gas molecules
enter and are absorbed into the ink-bottle micropores with the increase
of gas pressure, the swelling of coal matrix would happen, which further
narrows the pore throats. In the depressurization process, the absorbed
gas molecules can still diffuse from the constricted pores through
these narrowed pore throats, but it consumes more energy than that
which enables them to enter the pores. Therefore, the number of gas
molecules escaping from the constricted pores during desorption is
less than that during adsorption at the same gas pressure, resulting
in the desorption hysteresis.

3 Conclusions
To find an efficient refrigeration mode for the freezing coring
technology used in GIP estimation, the freezing tests of coal containing
gas are separately conducted by adding 2 kg of dry ice and injecting
different amounts (0, 200, 400, and 600 mL) of ethanol as the catalyst.
The article probes both the temperature and gas pressure evolvement
in coal, and the following conclusions can be drawn from the test
results:(1) The temperature evolvement of coal
during freezing tests is divided into three stages: rapid cooling
in the early stage, low-temperature preservation in the mid-stage,
and slow rising in the later stage. Under the catalysis of ethanol,
the average cooling rate of coal gradually accelerates with the increased
dose of ethanol (from 0 to 600 mL) in the early stage.

(2) When charging gas into the coal canister,
the cooling rate of the coal center at each subzero temperature gradually
accelerates with the increased gas pressure (from 0 to 2.15 MPa),
and the low temperature preservation time of coal (<0 °C)
is also prolonged.

(3) During the cooling stage, some free
gas molecules are absorbed in coal, so the gas pressure continuously
decreases until thermal equilibrium; then, it gradually picks up and
eventually returns to the initial equilibrium pressure during the
heating. There is a good linear relationship between gas pressure
and coal temperature.

(4) CH4 adsorption and desorption
are basically reversible, but the desorption hysteresis is extensively
observed at different adsorption pressures, associated with the occurrence
of numerous ink-bottle type micropores.



4 Experimental Methodology
4.1 Sample Preparation
The fresh coking
coal samples used in this study were collected from no. 42207 longwall
panel of Xingwu coalmine, Liulin, located in the Shanxi province of
China, and then were sealed immediately to prevent oxidation. When
using the coring tube in coalbed drilling, the obtained sample is
more similar to molded coal than coal powder under compaction. Thus,
coking coal specimens were first ground and sieved using 0.17–0.25
mm metal sifters, and evenly mixed with an appropriate amount of distilled
water. Subsequently, they were placed into a mold and loaded with
60 kN pressure for 30 min. After molding and dehydration for 3 h at
105 °C, the prepared sample was stored in a dehydrator for later
use (see Figure 7).
The physical parameters of the coal specimen were evaluated using
Chinese national standards (GB/T 212-2008, 217-2008, 6949-1998) shown
in Table 4: ash content
(Aad), volatile matter (Vad), moisture (Mad), true
relative density (TRD2020), apparent relative density (ARD2020), firmness (f), and
porosity.

4.2 Freezing Test Procedure
of Coal Specimen
In order to investigate freezing performances
of different refrigeration
modes on the coal specimen, temperature evolvement both of the coal
center and sidewall are monitored by PT100 thermal resistance sensors
(range: −100 to 200 °C) during the freezing test. The
physical experimental equipment consists of an airtight sample canister,
the refrigeration system, vacuum degassing devices, a quantitative
gas charging system, data acquisition system, and pipelines (Figure 8). The coal canister
is made of stainless steel with the inner diameter of 6.00 cm, the
wall thickness of 1.00 cm, the height of 18.2 cm, and the pressure
resistance of 16 MPa. Two temperature sensors and a pressure sensor
are separately arranged at the top and bottom of the coal canister.
The ethanol inlet is attached to the outside of the freezing tank.

Figure 8 Schematic
setup for coal containing gas freezing test.

The freezing test procedures of coal containing gas at 1.09 MPa
pressure are shown as follows: (1) place the molded coal specimens
into the coal canister and double-check the tightness of the whole
test system with soap water. (2) Vacuum the coal canister below 10
Pa, and then charge a certain amount of methane into the canister
via the reference cell. (3) Monitor the pressure variation of the
coal sample to determine the adsorption equilibrium pressure of 1.09
MPa or not, and only when the pressure remains unchanged at the ambient
temperature of 23 °C for 12 h, can the phase end. (4) After adding
the calculated dry ice and ethanol, place the coal canister into the
freezing tank and simultaneously monitor the evolvements of temperature
and pressure in the coal sample. (5) Repeat steps 1–4 until
all scheduled tests under different adsorption pressures and refrigeration
modes are conducted.

4.3 Cryogen Dose Evaluation
There are
three common refrigerants: freon, dry ice, and liquid nitrogen (LN2). The freon method achieves the refrigeration effect mainly
via the operation of a compressor, which is limited by the underground
sampling conditions and only used in laboratory simulations. As an
efficient cryogen, LN2 is widely used in the biorefrigeration
industry and its boiling point is 76.6 K. However, LN2 can
only be preserved in vacuum, and the storage container must have enough
capacity of pressure resistance, presenting a big challenge for developing
a portable LN2 freezing coring tube. Thus, dry ice becomes
the preferred choice when taking safety and cost into account. As
shown in Figure 9,
the 3-phase point parameters of CO2 are about: temperature
of 216 K and pressure of 0.52 MPa. When heated at atmospheric pressure,
dry ice directly sublimates to the gaseous state. Moreover, the freezing
point of ethanol (155.85 K) is much lower than that of dry ice (194.65
K), so that liquid ethanol can continue to provide heat to sublimate
more dry ice.

Figure 9 3-Phases diagram of CO2.

4.3.1 Calculation of Dry Ice Volume under Ideal
Conditions
Taking the coal sample and the refrigeration system
as a whole, when the cooling temperature of the whole system reaches
equilibrium, the total amount of heat absorbed by dry ice sublimation
is equal to the sum of the freezing capacity needed by the coal specimen,
sample canister, refrigeration tank, and ethanol under ideal conditions.
Thus, the freezing capacity provided by dry ice is calculated based
on the energy conservation law 6  where Q1 is the
freezing capacity provided by dry ice under ideal conditions; and Qcoal, Qtankcoal, Qtankrefrigeration, and Qethanol are the freezing capacity
absorbed by the coal sample, sample canister, refrigeration tank,
and ethanol, respectively, when the system reaches temperature equilibrium.
By introducing the specific heat capacity equation into eq 6, the volume form can be written
as follows 7  where qv is the
volume sublimation heat of dry ice; V1 is the required dry ice volume under ideal conditions; ΔT is the temperature difference of the freezing system; Ccoal, Ctankcoal, Ctankrefrigeration, and Cethanol are the volumetric specific
heat capacity of the coal sample, sample canister, refrigeration tank,
and ethanol, respectively; and Vcoal, Vtankcoal, Vtankrefrigeration, and Vethanol are
the volume of the coal sample, coal canister, refrigeration tank,
and ethanol, respectively.

The above physical parameters are
shown in Table 5, qv is 9.91 × 108 J/m3 and ΔT is 65 K here. By substituting these
values into eq 7, the
dry ice weight required by injecting different amounts of ethanol
under ideal conditions (M1) can be evaluated
as listed in Table 6.

4.3.2 Dry Ice Loss during Freezing
Test
The outside surface of the freezing tank is wrapped
around with a
flexible nitrile rubber–polyvinyl chloride insulation layer
of 0.01 m, which can form multiple barriers to water vapor molecules
due to low heat conductivity. However, there will still be some inevitable
heat exchange with the ambient during the cooling process. According
to “Codes for Design of Insulation Engineering for Industrial
Equipment and Pipeline32”, the loss
of the cooling capacity of cylindrical single-layer insulator is calculated
by eq 8 8  where Q0 is heat
loss on per unit area of the insulation layer surface; D1 is the external diameter of the insulation layer, 0.182
m; D2 is the internal diameter of the
insulation layer, 0.180 m; λ is the heat conductivity of the
insulator, 0.034 W/(m·K); and α is the surface heat transfer
coefficient, 11.63 W/(m2·K). Thus, Q0 of 562.48 W/m2 is obtained here by inputting
the parameters.

Successively, the total freezing capacity loss
of dry ice during test (Q2) can be evaluated
by eq 9 9   10  where S is the surface
area
of the insulation layer; t is the holding time, 2.5
h; H is the height of the insulation layer, 0.21
m; and V2 is the loss volume of dry ice
in the test.

Consequently, the loss amount of dry ice in the
test (M2) is about 0.95 kg by fitting
the parameters.

4.3.3 Gas Absorption Heat in
Freezing Process
For a gas–solid sorption system,
the adsorption equilibrium
will be broken by the temperature change. Previous tests indicated
that cooling can largely reduce kinetic energy of gas molecules, and
more gas molecules will be adsorbed on the surface of the coal matrix
when the kinetic energy of gas molecules is lower than the adsorption
barrier. The readsorption heat of gas molecules in the freezing process
could be evaluated as follows.

Assume that the total adsorption
space contains N independent gas molecules, which
are in two states: free state and adsorbed state.45 The potential energy46 of gas
molecules in the free/adsorbed state is εf, εa and the molecular number is Nf, Na, respectively. Regardless of the
interaction between gas molecules, the adsorption heat of a single
gas molecule can be expressed as35 11  

When the system equilibrates again at the temperature of T, gas molecules obey the Boltzmann distribution48 12  where α = μ/kT, β = 1/kT, and k is the
Boltzmann constant. From Na + Nf = N, eq 12 can be rewritten in the following form by
logarithm of both members. 13   14  

Then, the total adsorption heat of free gas molecules can
be obtained
as follow 15  where N/n = Nf/nf = Na/na = R/k = NA, R is the molar
gas constant; n is the total gas amount; na is the amount of absorbed gas; nf is the amount of free gas, and NA is the Avogadro constant. As the absorbed gas is dominant
in coal, owing to the lower potential energy than free gas (Nf < Na), the
adsorption is an exothermic process.

Because of the total gas
mass conservation before and after freezing,
the absorbed gas amount, na can be calculated
based on the ideal gas state equation 16  where ΔP is pressure
difference of the reference cell when the sorption system first reaches
equilibrium at the setting pressure; Vcellreference is
the volume of reference cell (here the gas reduction in reference
cell is actually the total amount of charging gas into coal canister); P2 is the gas pressure when coal is frozen at
the temperature of T; Vf is the volume of free gas in coal canister; T1 is the ambient temperature; Z, Z1 are gas compressibility factors at the relevant temperature
and pressure, respectively, derived by the Redlich–Kwong equation;
and R is the gas constant.

Therefore, the volume
of dry ice consumed by the absorption heat
(V3) is evaluated as follows 17  

As the dry
ice weight consumed by the absorption heat is quite
small (<0.01 kg), it is neglected in the tests. It is identical
with previous conclusions33−35 that gas molecules are physically
absorbed in coal and the adsorption heat is often less than 30 kJ/mol.
Additionally, the consumption of dry ice is not much different when
injecting different amounts of ethanol, and thus the following tests
were conducted with the amount of dry ice of 2 kg (the sum of M1 and M2) for the
sake of uniform measurement.
