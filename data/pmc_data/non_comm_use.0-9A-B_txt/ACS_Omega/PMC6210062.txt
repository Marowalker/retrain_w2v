A facile generation
of organic solvents of anhydrous grade can
be performed by distillation from sodium–benzophenone ketyl,
which is prepared from commercial sodium dispersion and benzophenone.
The distilled tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, hexane, 1,2-dimethoxyethane,
and 1,4-dioxane with water contents less than 10 ppm were obtained
by a simple protocol. Safe treatment of the distillation residue also
was simply achieved by the addition of methanol. The protocol suits
for providing a small amount of an anhydrous solvent at the laboratory
scale.

==== Body
Introduction
Use of an anhydrous
organic solvent in a laboratory scale is an
essential issue in modern organic synthesis.1 A wide range of organic and organometallic reactions particularly
in transition-metal catalysis and carbanion chemistry are carried
out in an inert atmosphere, and therefore, the reaction should be
performed with anhydrous solvents.2 Dehydration
of solvents is carried out by treatment with sodium–benzophenone
ketyl prior to distillation, in which a sodium lump/wire has been
employed. However, the protocol requires significant care for the
safe operation because of the highly explosive characteristics of
the concentrated distillation residue to exposure to air as well as
disposal of unreacted sodium metal after quenching with protic solvents
such as alcohols and water.3 A new protocol
for the dehydration of solvents to pass through alumina and copper columns developed by Grubbs was
shown to produce extremely anhydrous solvents by a simple procedure,4 which completely replaced the conventional distillation
protocol employing sodium–benzophenone ketyl.3 However, the system still involves difficulties concerning
the cost of the dehydration apparatus as well as space limitation
by increasing the kind of anhydrous solvents in a laboratory. Accordingly,
on-demand construction of an additional distillation apparatus of
benzophenone ketyl is still a choice to afford a dehydrated solvent
if dehydration of the solvent can be performed in a safe manner. We
herein disclose that the use of a sodium dispersion in a mineral oil5a in place of a sodium lump
for the preparation of the benzophenone ketyl radical in a distillation
flask provides several anhydrous solvents and treatment of the distillation
residue by alcohol followed by water can be performed safely. Sodium
dispersed in a mineral oil is remarkably stabilized to exposure to
moisture in the air; however, the increased surface area improves
the reactivity toward heterogeneous conditions compared with the use
of a sodium lump. Indeed, a sodium dispersion has been developed for
the dechlorinative degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)5b,5c Several applications of a sodium dispersion to synthetic organic
reactions have also been recently reported.6

Results and Discussion
We first studied the dehydration
of tetrahydrofuran (THF), which
is widely employed in the reactions of anhydrous conditions in organic
synthesis. The distillation vessel for THF was prepared by dissolving
benzophenone (1 mg/mL) in a two-necked flask equipped with a distillation
head as shown in Figure 1a. A sodium dispersion (25% Na in mineral oil, w/w)a was then added to the solution until the color of the mixture
turned dark blue (Figure 1b). THF was then collected to the distillation head by heating
the mixture at 85 °C at an ambient pressure. Measurement of contents
of water was carried out by a Karl-Fischer titration apparatus to
reveal 7.23 ppm.7 Although attempted dehydration
employing 10 times larger amount of the sodium lump and benzophenone
was also carried out, the mixture in the distillation vessel did not
show any color change by the formation of ketyl at all.b The result shows that a considerably larger amount of sodium
and benzophenone is necessary for the dehydration in the use of the
sodium lump. Thus, the use of a much smaller amount of the sodium
dispersion effectively improved the dehydration efficiency because
of its larger surface area. Distillation from the benzophenone ketyl/sodium
dispersion of a higher content of sodium in mineral oil (40%, w/w)
under similar conditions (normalized by the Na amount) showed a slightly
inferior dehydration performance (50 w/w % in mineral oil: 17.34 ppm).
Although commercially available sodium sand (25–35 w/w % in
paraffin) was also examined for the dehydration of THF, little color
change by the formation of benzophenone ketyl was observed. Several
organic solvents such as hexane, diethyl ether, 1,2-dimethoxyethane
(DME), and 1,4-dioxane were dehydrated in a similar manner to afford
the corresponding anhydrous solvents with water contents of <10
ppm as summarized in Table 1. Contamination of the mineral oil of the sodium dispersion
in the distilled solvent was hardly observed by 1H NMR
and gas chromatography (GC) analysis.c

Because
of a large volume of manipulating infrastructure of the
Grubbs’ column,4 a wide range of
solvents for a permanent setup in a small-scale laboratory might be
limited, despite the requirement of solvent diversity to be screened
for the purpose of finding the most suitable conditions, which frequently
occurs in the research of organic chemistry. Various solvents of the
anhydrous grade are supplied commercially as 100 mL to 4 L in sealed
bottles. The use of such dehydrated solvents could be highly effective
when these solvents are consumed immediately once opened. However,
the quality of the solvent as an anhydrous grade gradually becomes
inferior after the bottle is frequently used by transferring to a
syringe or a reaction vessel with a needle through the sealed rubber
septum. Nevertheless, only a small quantity of an anhydrous solvent
of 1–10 mL scale occurs frequently in the laboratory. A small
size of the distillation apparatus for dehydration can be set in a
corner of the laboratory bench, which is readily straightened once
distillation is complete. The glassware apparatus can also be switched
easily on the use of a different solvent.

It should be pointed
out that, after collecting the solvent, visible
aggregation of sodium metal was hardly observed in the concentrated
residue composed of THF, sodium dispersion, and mineral oil. [Caution! The authors do not recommend further concentration
of the distillation flask into almost dryness because safety to the
explosive chain reaction of THF radical with oxygen has not been guaranteed
to date.] The system was cooled to room temperature and the addition
of methanol to the residue dropwise immediately showed the disappearance
of the blue color of the ketyl radical to light yellow (Figure 2).d Comparing
with the post-treatment of the still of benzophenone ketyl employing
a sodium lump, which generally requires the use of 2-propanol carefully
for safety, it is remarkable that sodium dispersion can be easily
quenched directly with methanol in a well-ventilated hood. Addition
of the mixture into a large quantity of water resulted in phase separation
and both phases thus separated were disposed safely.

quenching by methanol.

Conclusions
In short, distillation generating an anhydrous
solvent employing
a sodium dispersion is quite simple employing switchable glassware.
Several solvents of water contents of <10 ppm were obtained by
simple distillation from benzophenone ketyl that was formed by the
sodium dispersion. Quenching of the distillation residue can also
be performed safely by the addition of methanol to result in the immediate
disappearance of the blue color of benzophenone ketyl. Permanent setup
of the distillation apparatus is not necessary on the laboratory bench.
The protocol shows facile formation of a wide range of anhydrous solvents
and therefore suits to experiments in a small laboratory scale (up
to ca. 10 mL use) when a commercially available dehydrated solvent
cannot be consumed within a short term to result in frequent transfer
of the solvent with a needle through the sealed rubber septum.

Experimental
Section
General
Solvents were purchased as an anhydrous grade
from Kanto Chemical Co. Ltd., Nacalai Tesque, Inc., or Wako Pure Chemicals
Co. Ltd. The sodium dispersion was employed as 25% Na in mineral oil
(w/w)a or 50% (w/w) available from Strem Chemicals
Inc. The bottle was shaken vigorously prior to the use. Sodium sand
(25–35 w/w % in paraffin) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Co. Ltd. Benzophenone from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd. was used as purchased.
Titration of water contents was performed with a Karl-Fischer titration
apparatus (CA-21 Mitsubishi Chemicals Co. Ltd.). 1H NMR
(400 MHz) spectra were measured on a JEOL ECZ spectrometer in CDCl3. GC analysis was carried out with Agilent7890A at Nittetsu-Sumikin
Technologies Co. Ltd. (Himeji, Hyogo, Japan) with HP-5 ms (0.32 mm
× 30 m) using helium as a carrier gas at the flow rate of 2–4
mL/min at the column temperature of 35–320 °C using a
flame ionization detector detector.

General Procedure for the
Distillation of the Solvent from Sodium
Dispersion/Benzophenone Ketyl
To a 200 mL two-necked round-bottomed
flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, distillation head, and
nitrogen inlet was added 50 mL of THF, whose water content was 31.80
ppm. The flask was immersed in an oil bath. Benzophenone (50 mg) was
added to into THF to form a clear colorless solution to which the
sodium dispersion (70 mg) was added dropwise to observe the immediate
color change to dark blue. The solution was refluxed for 2 h and then
collected in the distillation head. The obtained dehydrated THF was
taken to a syringe and subjected to Karl-Fischer titration to observe
7.23 ppm of water contents. Dehydration of other solvents was carried
out in a similar manner to show water contents less than 20 ppm (see Table 1). Quenching of the
distillation residue by methanol was carried out as follows: after
cooling the distillation residue to room temperature, the flask was
transferred to a well-ventilated hood. Then, 5 mL of methanol was
added dropwise under a nitrogen atmosphere. The color of the mixture
immediately changed to light yellow. Water (50 mL) was added to the
mixture to observe separation into organic and aqueous phases.
