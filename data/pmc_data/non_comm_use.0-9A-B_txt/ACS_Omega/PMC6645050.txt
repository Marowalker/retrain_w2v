Among the several variants of the
highly useful and versatile Robinson
annulation, a particular variation that involves ketones reacting
with nonenolizable enones, while the α-carbons of the ketones
act as nucleophiles at both steps of this cascade process, remains
largely unexplored. Moreover, such a catalytic enantioselective reaction
is exceptionally rare. While pursuing catalysis of this transformation,
we developed two fluorogenic assays that, in combination with other
analytic techniques, enabled rapid screening of several sets of catalysts.
The first set of polymer-bound aminourea bifunctional organocatalysts
was screened using a two-step fluorogenic protocol, designed for slower
(e.g., heterogeneous) catalysts. Robinson annulation of acetone with
4′-nitrochalcone formed 3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyl-2-cyclohexenone,
which, after a “developing” reductive treatment, was
converted into the corresponding amino derivative, serving as a fluorescent
reporter. On the other hand, a range of potentially faster homogeneous
catalyst–cocatalyst systems were examined using a direct assay,
where 4′-dimethylaminochalcone is converted into the corresponding
cyclohexanone fluorescent reporter already upon annulation with acetone.
In both cases, the combination of the fluorogenic protocols with high-performance
liquid chromatography-based enantiomeric excess estimation enabled
identification of lead catalysts, which promoted the enantioselective
version of this variant of the annulation.

Introduction
Powerful screening
analytic techniques are key tools in a successful
catalyst design, development, and optimization study. Today, the majority
of screening techniques in the field of catalysis are based on NMR,
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), or gas chromatography
(GC) methodology.1 Occasionally, however,
discrepancies between the results obtained by these methods are observed.
Whether these are inflicted by byproducts, their signals overlapping
with those of the compounds being used for analysis (products, substrates,
or internal references) or by other inherent pitfalls, a complimentary
technique based on a different analytical principle can constitute
a true benefit in these cases. Moreover, screening techniques bearing
potential for parallel evaluation are beneficial in terms of time-economy,
when compared with those described above, which must be usually applied
in a sequential manner.2

Recently,
we became interested in developing an organocatalytic
system for an asymmetric Robinson annulation, particularly for this
reaction variant involving a simple ketone, serving as a nucleophile
at both steps of annulation. The Robinson annulation reaction is a
well-known cascade process, initiated by an intermolecular Michael
addition, which is then succeeded by an intramolecular aldol condensation.3 Cascade processes foster an increase in synthetic
efficiency by decreasing the number of laboratory operations and chemicals
at use, in addition to avoiding time-consuming protecting group manipulations
and isolation of reaction intermediates. Specifically, the popular
Robinson annulation domino sequence could be utilized as a convenient
method for obtaining asymmetric cyclohexenone derivatives, which are
of great value for the synthesis of many natural products, antibiotics,
and steroids,4 and otherwise require more
complex synthetic routes for their assembly.

Most frequently,
this transformation involves a 1,3-dicarbonyl
or a related compound and an alkenyl-alkyl ketone (methyl vinyl ketone
or its substituted analogues),5 which act
as a nucleophile and an electrophile, respectively, at the intermolecular
step of the reaction (Figure 1a). At the intramolecular step, the roles of the components
originating from the two substrates are reversed, that is, the alkyl
substituent of the former enone turns into a nucleophile, attacking
one of the carbonyls of the former dicarbonyl compound. Occasionally,
ketones or aldehydes are used instead of dicarbonyls, without a significant
change in the mechanism of the reaction (Figure 1b).6 In a less
common, but still relatively abundant, case, a dicarbonyl compound
reacts with an enone lacking an enolizable alkyl substituent (e.g.,
chalcone) and provides two nucleophilic centers, one for the Michael
addition step and one for the subsequent aldol condensation (Figure 1c).7,8 On the other hand, the variant of the Robinson annulation that involves
a simple dialkyl ketone and a chalcone or other enone without an α-to-carbonyl
enolizable group, and hence requires the two α carbons of the
ketone to act as nucleophiles at both steps of the cascade, is rare
(Figure 1d).9−11 Moreover, although it was already demonstrated over 40 years ago
that organocatalysts, l-proline in particular, are viable
for enantioselectively conducting the regular one-pot Robinson annulation
reactions,12,13 an enantioselective version of
the particular annulation variant, involving a ketone and a nonenolizable
enone, has been reported only this year.9c

variants of the Robinson annulation: abundant (a–c)
as well as a rare variant described in this work (d). Red dots mark
the carbons acting as nucleophiles, whereas blue dots mark those acting
as electrophiles.

Recently, we observed
that PS(l-Val-DPEN), a chiral bifunctional
polystyrene (PS)-bound organocatalyst, originally designed for an
asymmetric nitro-Michael addition reaction,14 promotes the asymmetric Robinson annulation reaction between chalcone
and acetone with promising enantioselectivity but poor yield. According
to 1H NMR analysis, as much as 30 molar % of the catalyst
gave a disappointing 13% yield (Scheme 1). Although HPLC analysis provided the enantiomeric
excess (ee), there was a certain discrepancy in the yield estimation
of the reaction by HPLC compared to that by NMR analysis. At this
point, we decided to develop a fluorogenic assay as an additional
method for analyzing the efficiency of the catalysts in this reaction.
Offering extremely high sensitivity, fluorescence measurements have
recently gained great momentum as one of the methods enabling the
detection and quantification of the product acquired in a catalytic
reaction.15 Consequently, generating a
fluorophore-incorporating product in methodology development is useful
for analytical purposes, with both standard fluorescence measurement
and fluorescence detection in liquid chromatography available as analytical
methods.16 We presumed that such a technique
would allow easy and expedient evaluation of the reaction yield, deliver
the desired information with a higher sensitivity, and would therefore
provide a convenient screening process for different catalysts, particularly
in a parallel fashion.

The absolute configuration of the stereogenic
center was never determined, thus, the enantiomer received in a larger
amount might be the opposite of the one depicted.

Results
and Discussion
The basis for the fluorogenic reactions themselves
lies in structural
modifications, such as the generation or extension of a conjugated
system within a molecule. As is apparent from the reaction scheme
(Scheme 2), the transformation
extends the conjugation involving the aromatic ring at the 1 position
of chalcone (henceforth Ar1), while producing 3,5-diarylcyclohex-2-enone
as the reaction product. Consequently, we planned to exploit this
expanded conjugation for transforming the reaction into a fluorogenic
one by proper substrate design. Accordingly, we decided to incorporate
an electron-donating group (EDG) into the para-position
of Ar1, thus producing an elongated electron donating–withdrawing
conjugated system in the cyclohexenone product, potentially reinforcing
its fluorescent output. Because an EDG at this position was expected
to impede both the Michael addition and the aldol condensation steps
of the annulation, we decided to counterbalance this influence by
substituting the para-position of the aromatic ring at the 3-position
of chalcone (henceforth Ar2) with an electron-withdrawing
group (EWG). We expected that this substitution would facilitate the
intermolecular addition step, which we assumed to be the rate-determining
step of the transformation.

Scheme 2 Incorporation of Electron-Donating
and -Withdrawing Groups in the
Substrate Aimed at Generating Extended Conjugation in the Product
The disubstituted chalcones,
namely, (R1,R2)-chalcones, with R1 = OH, NH2, or NMe2 and R2 = NO2 or CN, were synthesized
from the appropriate derivatives of benzaldehyde and acetophenone
by a base-catalyzed aldol condensation (Scheme 3).17 For obtaining
the corresponding (R1,R2)-cyclohexenones (the
potential products of our catalytic reaction), we applied a two-step
procedure in solution (rather than the PS(l-Val-DPEN) catalysis),18 consisting of a more common Robinson annulation
reaction with methyl acetoacetate, followed by hydrolysis and decarboxylation
(Scheme 3). Gratifyingly,
both syntheses did not require a protecting group when involving a
phenol substrate. On the other hand, the synthesis of (NMe2,NO2)-chalcone, unlike all of the other chalcones, entailed
a separate dehydration step under acidic conditions, since the reaction
between p-dimethylaminoacetophenone and p-nitrobenzaldehyde mainly afforded the addition product. Of note,
with the aim of isolating the substituents’ effect, we also
explored monosubstituted chalcones (R1 = H or R2 = H). Noteworthy is that all of the chalcone derivatives we obtained
(either disubstituted or monosubstituted) were the trans-isomers exclusively.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of (R1,R2)-Chalcones and (R1,R2)-Cyclohexenones
When light absorption and emission of representative (R1,R2)-cyclohexenones were measured (Table 1), we learnt that R1, which is
part of the cyclohexenone’s conjugated system, affects the
value of λmax of absorption/fluorescence. As the
substituent donates electrons more strongly, the compound absorbs
light at a longer wavelength, with λmax of absorption
red-shifted to 370 nm for the most donating NMe2 substituent
(entries 4 and 7). The data also discloses that a nitro substituent
as R2 (and as we later discovered in any position of the
chalcone) quenches fluorescence (entries 3 vs 6 and entries 4 vs 7).
More importantly, the data reveals that an amino substituent as R1 leads to a fluorescent cyclohexenone (entries 6 and 7), as
desired, with the greater fluorescence clearly being that of a tertiary
amine. In other words, (NR2,R2)-chalcones (R
= H or alkyl; R2 ≠ NO2) are suitable
substrates for a fluorogenic reaction, especially when the amino nitrogen
is alkylated. In this regard, we find it worth mentioning structurally
related 7-aminocoumarins, which exhibit excellent fluorescent properties
and are often used for biological and medicinal applications.19,20

Having been
left with a CN group as an EWG of choice in the R2 position,
we expanded the repertoire of potential precursors
to adequate fluorogenic reporters to (NBu2,CN)-chalcone
(in addition to (NH2,CN)- and (NMe2,CN)-chalcones),
which was expected to provide better solubility in most solvents.
These substrates were tested under the original catalysis conditions
with PS(l-Val-DPEN), to determine their reactivity as substrates
and compare it to that of related (R1,H)-chalcones (Table 2). Unfortunately,
the results of these experiments revealed that the influence of the
amino group in the R1 position causes a lowering of the
reaction yield, which is not counterbalanced by the influence of the
cyano group in the R2 position. Attempts to improve the
yield, by the replacement of toluene by a different solvent, failed.

acid (0.2 equiv), toluene, 75 °C,
4 days.

b Yields were determined
according
to 1H NMR analysis.

Because the chosen chalcones afforded very low yields (6–10%)
under the conditions that already employed a high catalyst loading
(30 molar %) and prolonged reaction times (4 days), it became apparent
that (NR2,R2)-chalcones, in general, and (NR2,CN)-chalcones, in particular, could serve as substrates for
screening only the most active catalysts (with PS(l-Val-DPEN)
not being one of them).

With an amino group as R1 being a critical element for
inducing fluorescence in the product cyclohexenone, all the while
decreasing the reaction rate, we sought an alternative substrate and/or
reaction pathway, which would enhance the reaction yield without relinquishing
fluorescence. One such proposal led to (NO2,H)-chalcone
as our new substrate, which can be seen as an oxidized form of (NH2,H)-chalcone and can be converted to it, subsequent to the
catalytic reaction. Satisfyingly, this substrate provided a yield
of 55% in the catalytic reaction of PS(l-Val-DPEN), as determined
by 1H NMR analysis. We should comment that the engagement
of (NO2,CN)-chalcone as our substrate was initially attempted
because EWG as R2 could further enhance the reaction rate,
yet the substance was found to have very low solubility in the relevant
solvents. Thus, (NO2,H)-chalcone remained a substrate of
choice. Furthermore, monitoring the reaction progress by GC analysis
demonstrated that the reaction period for (NO2,H)-chalcone
could be shortened from 4 days to merely 1 day, seeing as above 50%
yield is already achieved at that point in time.

As mentioned
above, choosing to employ (NO2,H)-chalcone
as our new substrate required the adoption of a two-step approach
for the coveted fluorogenic assay, adding a postcatalysis reduction
step (Scheme 4). Thus,
by selectively reducing the nitro group at the end of the reaction,
we attained (NH2,H)-cyclohexenone as a detectable reporter.
In spite of producing a weaker fluorophore in comparison to (NMe2,R2)-cyclohexenones, we were pleased to discover
that the fluorescence still sufficed for the catalyst activity evaluation.
After testing a number of reducing agents, we finally came upon tin
chloride as a suitable reagent for our purpose,21 since it was found to selectively reduce any nitro substrate
to the corresponding amino product in a quantitative yield. Noteworthy,
olefins and ketones were not affected by this reagent.

Scheme 4 Two-Step
Methodology for Acquiring a Detectable Fluorophore Reporter
Catalytic reaction conditions:
(NO2,H)-chalcone (1 equiv), acetone (30 equiv), polymer-supported
catalyst (0.3 equiv), benzoic acid (0.2 equiv), toluene, 75 °C,
24 h. Reduction conditions: catalytic mixture of (NO2,H)-cyclohexenone
and leftover (NO2,H)-chalcone (1 equiv total), tin chloride
dihydrate (10 equiv), ethanol, reflux, 40 min.

The finalized protocol for testing the polymer-supported catalysts
consisted of the catalytic reaction of (NO2,H)-chalcone
with acetone, followed by easily filtering out the catalyst at the
end of the reaction. A small sample of the reaction mixture can be
saved at this stage for the future determination of the enantiomeric
excess (e.g., by HPLC analysis with a chiral column) for the most
active catalysts. The rest of the reaction mixture undergoes a procedure,
which selectively reduces the nitro group to an amino group, and consequently
enables us to turn to a microplate reader for fluorescence measurements
(Figure 2). (NH2,H)-Chalcone, obtained by reducing (NO2,H)-chalcone
(taken in an amount equivalent to that remaining in a catalytic reaction
with a 0% yield), was found to have no substantial fluorescence. On
the other hand, the fluorescence of (NH2,H)-cyclohexenone,
gained by reducing (NO2,H)-cyclohexenone (taken in an amount
equivalent to that expected for a 100% yield in the catalytic reaction),
corresponds to the maximum fluorescence intensity, namely, Fmax. As a result, the relative intensity of
fluorescence, measured for each of the reduced catalytic reaction
mixtures, correlates to the relative yield of (NO2,H)-cyclohexenone
and it therefore represents the relative activity of the catalyst.

Figure 2 Fluorescence
measured (λex = 360 nm) by a microplate
reader for the catalytic reaction mixture (PS(l-Val-DPEN)
catalysis) after reduction, for (NH2,H)-chalcone, obtained
by reduction of (NO2,H)-chalcone and for (NH2,H)-cyclohexenone, gained by reduction of (NO2,H)-cyclohexenone.

Once having found the more active
catalysts, the ee measurements
of the samples from the relevant catalytic reactions will be conducted.
Noteworthy, despite the unfavored separation of ee and yield measurements
into two different points in the protocol, we chose to measure the
ee for (NO2,H)-cyclohexenone rather than for (NH2,H)-cyclohexenone because the ee measured for (NO2,H)-cyclohexenone
is certainly unaffected by any further treatment, whereas the same
could not be said a priori for (NH2,H)-cyclohexenone.a

Great efforts were dedicated to refining and
to simplifying the
new protocol as much as possible. Particularly, the reduced reaction
mixture is not treated to any workup procedure and is simply diluted
in ethanol to obtain a proper concentration for fluorescence measurements.
This is done only after we verified that the reducing agent has no
effect on the results, even though such an effect would be identical
for all measurements. Furthermore, although the yield might be affected
by the overall treatment, any change in yield can be expected to be
roughly consistent, thus guaranteeing a proper comparison between
different catalysts. Still, to ensure the credibility of the new protocol,
we conducted reproducibility tests for catalysis with PS(l-Val-DPEN) (Figure 3) and PS(l-Val-CHN) (Figure 4, a catalyst that will be described shortly), which
demonstrated very good reproducibility of the results.

Figure 3 Reproducibility test
for catalysis with PS(l-Val-DPEN).
Fluorescence was measured (λex = 360 nm) by a microplate
reader for the reduced catalytic reaction mixture in three different
catalytic runs. Maximum intensities (λem = 460 nm):
142.25, 124.97, and 149.52 (σ = 10.3).

Figure 4 Reproducibility test for catalysis with PS(l-Val-CHN).
Fluorescence was measured (λex = 360 nm) by a microplate
reader for the reduced catalytic reaction mixture in two different
catalytic runs. Maximum intensities (λem = 460 nm):
122.48 and 125.44 (σ = 1.5).

Following these results, we decided to test the protocol
on a small
library of PS(l-Val-DPEN)-like catalysts (Figure 5). The members were prepared
by a method analogous to that used for PS(l-Val-DPEN) (Scheme 5).14 With the urea unit and the terminal primary amine governing
the catalytic activity of PS(l-Val-DPEN), we focused on changing
the amino acid on the one end of the catalyst and the chiral diamine
backbone on the other end of the catalyst in the design of new resin-supported
organocatalysts.

Figure 5 Small library of polymer-supported organocatalysts.

Scheme 5 Synthesis of PS(l-Val-DPEN)
This small library of catalysts
chiefly came to serve a proof of
concept but also to look for additional lead compounds beyond PS(l-Val-DPEN). Hence, each of the polymer-supported catalysts
was subjected to the two-step protocol, and the results are summarized
in Table 3. The calculated
yields were attained by dividing the measured fluorescence intensity
(Figure 6, λex = 360 nm, λem = 460 nm) by Fmax. As this was the first time we employed the protocol
for catalyst screening, we assured the validity of the calculated
yields by HPLC measurements and by 1H NMR analysis. The 1H NMR samples were prepared by evaporating the samples used
for the HPLC injections, in light of the fact that the signals of
the nitro derivatives are better resolved than those of the amino
derivatives.

measurements, gained after reduction, utilizing a microplate reader.

c Yields derived from HPLC measurements,
obtained before reduction, based on a calibration curve for (NO2,H)-cyclohexenone.

column, 100% methanol, 1.5 mL/min, 294 nm. Retention times: (NO2,H)-chalcone, 4.1 min; (NO2,H)-cyclohexenone enantiomers,
6.6 min (minor) and 8.0 min (major).

Noticeably, with the exception of PS(l-Val-CHN)
(entry
7), the yields obtained by the fluorescence measurements are in accordance
with the yields derived from the HPLC measurements, using a calibration
curve (entries 1–6). On the other hand, 1H NMR analysis,
which was based on the ratio of the starting material and the product
alone, produced higher yields, except in the case of PS(l-Val-CHN). A plausible explanation for this finding resides in side
products, which are created in trace amounts yet accumulate to give
a consistent deviation in the results.

Initially, according
to the protocol, the enantiomeric excess was
determined for the experiments described in entries 1, 2, 6, and 7,
for which higher yields were determined using the fluorescence measurements.
Eventually, because a very small library was used for this proof-of-principle
experiment, the ee values for all catalytic runs were determined.
Remarkably, even this small library hinted to definite trends within
this group of catalysts (despite the modest differences exhibited
by them) and provided us with two lead catalysts and, possibly, important
insights for future studies.

Thus, within the (1R,2R)-(+)-1,2-diphenylethylenediamine
(DPEN)-based series of catalysts, higher yields are associated with
bulkier side chains of the amino acid residue (iPr, tBu), whereas higher ee
values are associated with less sterically demanding side chains (Me,
Bn, and Ph). Noticeably, in the nitro-Michael addition of acetone
to trans-β-nitrostyrene, increasing the bulkiness
of the amino acid enhanced the activity conclusively, much like in
our case, though the ee values remained similar regardless of the
group’s bulkiness.14b Moreover,
in the case of the nitro-Michael addition, altering the chirality
of the amino acid part of the catalyst from l to d led to a great decrease in yield and a small decrease in ee. We
were surprised to find that, in the current case, using the d-valine amino acid in the valine–DPEN catalyst afforded a
similar yield and an obvious improvement in selectivity (entries 1
vs 2). This implies that a d configuration might be superior
in our case selectivitywise and provides a better lead catalyst (probably
due to the match–mismatch combination of the catalyst components).

From a comparison of the analogous DPEN-based and (1R,2R)-(−)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine (CHN)-based
catalysts (entries 1 vs 7), we conclude that CHN is favored as a chiral
scaffold for achieving higher enantioselectivity, whereas DPEN is
preferred for enhancing the reactivity. Interestingly, the nitro-Michael
addition of acetone to trans-β-nitrostyrene
revealed the exact opposite effect.14a This
finding provided an additional lead compound for future catalyst development
for the enantioselective Robinson annulation.

While the screening
of the set of polymer-bound catalysts demonstrated
the suitability of the fluorogenic assay for lead discovery in heterogeneous
catalysis, we decided to demonstrate its applicability also for the
homogeneous catalysis platform. Moreover, because homogeneous catalytic
systems usually demonstrate a higher activity compared to that of
the heterogeneous ones, we hoped to implement a direct (one-step)
fluorogenic assay rather than the two-step protocol described above,
whose use was dictated by the low activity of the supported catalysts.
As mentioned above, for more active catalysts, the use of less reactive
(NR2,R2)-chalcones, particularly (NMe2,H)-chalcone, which generates a fluorescent (NMe2,H)-cyclohexanone
reporter directly upon annulation and does not require an additional
“developing” reduction step, is possible.

A set
of potentially catalytic primary and secondary amines was,
therefore, used as homogeneous catalysts in the fluorogenic model
reaction of (NMe2,H)-chalcone with acetone (Scheme 6 and Table 4), initially without any acidic cocatalyst.
The results demonstrated a complete lack of activity for all tested
amines but pyrrolidine (12% yield), unequivocally pointing to pyrrolidine
as the only possible catalytic candidate.22 Noticeably, in one of the rare publications reporting this variant
of the annulation for more reactive chalcones,9b pyrrolidine was the most reactive amine catalyst, among
those examined. Taking into account that in the above-described case
of polymer-supported catalysis the activity of the system was boosted
up by benzoic acid, in the subsequent series of experiments, various
acidic additives were used in the model reaction catalyzed by pyrrolidine
(Table 5). From these
screening tests, p-nitrophenol emerged as a cocatalyst
of choice, outperforming carboxylic acids, such as benzoic and acetic
acids (entry 4 vs entries 2 and 3). Moreover, its activity also surpassed
that of the less acidic unsubstituted phenol (entry 5) and of the
substantially more acidic o,p-dinitrophenol
(entry 6). Noteworthy, the attempt to use o,p-dinitrophenol or an even stronger sulfonic or phosphoric
acid inhibited, or practically shut down, the catalysis (entries 6–8).
Importantly, in a separate experiment, we demonstrated that nitrophenol
reinforces pyrrolidine-induced catalysis but does not constitute a
catalyst by itself (entry 9).

Once
the p-nitrophenol cocatalytic ability was
revealed, we screened again the amines we previously attempted to
use as catalysts, this time in the presence of 30 molar % of p-nitrophenol (Table 6). Although this time the formation of a trace amount of the
product was observed in the experiments with some of the previously
inactive amines (entries 2–4, and 6), pyrrolidine still appeared
as the much more active catalyst, leading to a respectable, 43%, yield.
It must be taken into account that the substrate is the least active
of all of the chalcones we examined and when unsubstituted chalcone
or (NO2,H)-chalcone was reacted under identical conditions,
83 and 98% yields, respectively, were obtained.

b Yields determined according to fluorescence
measurements using a microplate reader.

Encouraged by these results, we turned to the screening
of various
chiral derivatives of pyrrolidine with or without the nitrophenol
cocatalyst (Table 7). All runs were accompanied by fluorescence measurements providing
the yield data, whereas HPLC analysis of the enantiomeric excess was
carried out only for the yields exceeding 20%. Pyrrolidines substituted
in the 3-position provided the highest yields, comparable to that
of pyrrolidine itself, and their activities were affected by p-nitrophenol to the same extent as that of pyrrolidine
(entries 1–4). Unfortunately, both (R)-3-aminopyrrolidine
and (R)-3-pyrrolidinol induced very low enantiomeric
excess. 2-Substituted pyrrolidines, such as l-proline amide, l-prolinol, and l-proline, were either inactive, even
in the presence of p-nitrophenol (entries 5–6),
or produced a racemate (entry 7). (R)-2-Methylpyrrolidine
and (S)-2-(methoxymethyl)pyrrolidine, on the other
hand, provided trace amounts of the product when tested alone but
demonstrated significantly improved yields and noticeable enantioselectivities
when paired with p-nitrophenol (entries 8–11).
The major apparent difference between the two groups of 2-substituted
pyrrolidines seems to be the hydrogen-bond-donating properties of
the substituent. Although the connection between this property and
the lack of catalytic activity or selectivity is not clear, it seems
that both pyrrolidine derivatives of the second group provide excellent
lead compounds for the development of enantioselective homogeneous
catalysts for the particular variant of the Robinson annulation, which
is the subject of this study.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we developed two novel fluorogenic
assays for fast
evaluation of catalytic efficiencies of homogeneous and heterogeneous
catalysts for a variant of the Robinson annulation, which involves
a simple dialkyl ketone (with two enolizable positions) and a chalcone
or other enone without an α-to-carbonyl enolizable group. Furthermore,
while performing a feasibility study of the assays, we were able to
identify a number of catalytic systems capable of performing this
cascade process in an enantioselective fashion, an achievement having
only little precedent in the literature. Although the four established
systems (two heterogeneous and two homogeneous) promoted the reaction
with only moderate selectivity, they constitute excellent lead cases
for future improvement of this enantioselective catalytic process.

Experimental
Section
General Experimental Conditions
All reactions, requiring
anhydrous conditions, were conducted under an atmosphere of nitrogen
in oven-dried glassware in dry solvents. Thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) was performed on silica gel plates, Merck 60 F254, and the compounds were visualized by irradiation with UV light
or by staining with KMnO4. Flash column chromatography
was carried out using silica gel Merck 60 (particle size 0.040–0.063
mm); the eluent is given in parentheses. 1H NMR (400 MHz)
and 13C NMR (100 MHz) spectra were recorded on Bruker AVANCE-400
spectrometers, in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6 with residual DMSO-d5 (1H, 2.50 ppm) or DMSO-d6 (13C, 39.52 ppm), or in CDCl3 or CDCl3/trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) 1:1 with residual CHCl3 (1H, 7.26
ppm) or CDCl3 (13C, 77.16 ppm) as an internal
standard. Gel-phase 13C NMR (100 MHz) spectra were recorded
in benzene-d6 on Bruker AVANCE-400 spectrometers
using the solvent as an internal standard (126.0 ppm). HPLC experiments
were carried out using a Chiralpak-IB column on a Hitachi instrument,
equipped with a UV/Vis detector,
with methanol as the eluting solvent. For solid phase synthesis, yields
were determined using the 1H NMR spectra of CDCl3/TFA 1:1 cleavage solutions with 34 mM 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane
(5.95 ppm) as an internal standard.

Typical Procedure for the
Preparation of Aminourea Polystyrene-Supported
Catalysts
PS(l-Val-DPEN)
Fmoc-l-Val-Wang resin
(loading 0.80 mmol/g) was washed with piperidine/dimethylformamide
(DMF) (20:80) (×3) for removal of the fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl
(Fmoc) protecting group. The resin was washed with DMF, tetrahydrofuran
(THF), and dichloromethane (DCM) and then dried under vacuum. Phenyl
chloroformate (10 equiv per amine unit), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (20 equiv per amine unit), and a
catalytic amount of pyridine (0.1 equiv per amine unit) were added
to a suspension of the amine-terminated resin (1 equiv) in dry THF
(10 mL per 1 g resin) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The suspension
was stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The resin was washed with
water, THF/water, THF, and DCM and then dried under vacuum. (1R,2R)-1,2-Diphenylethane-1,2-diamine (7
equiv per amine unit) was added to a suspension of the resin (1 equiv)
in dry DMF (10 mL per 1 g resin) under an atmosphere of nitrogen.
The suspension was stirred at 50 °C overnight. The resin was
washed with DMF/water, DMF, THF/water, THF, and DCM and then dried
under vacuum.

[i.e., (OH,CN)-Chalcone]
The synthesis of the chalcone derivatives
was based on the literature procedure with some modifications.17p-Hydroxyacetophenone (1.04
g, 7.6 mmol, 1 equiv) was dissolved in a mixture of ethanol (4 mL)
and aqueous sodium hydroxide (0.40 g in 6 mL of water, 10.0 mmol,
1.3 equiv). p-Cyanobenzaldehyde (1.00 g, 7.6 mmol,
1 equiv) was then added, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature,
until TLC indicated completion of the reaction, to obtain a bright
orange solid. The mixture was kept in a refrigerator overnight; thereafter,
the solid was filtered and washed with a mixture of ice and water
under vacuum until the washings were neutral (pH = 7). The residue
was dissolved in DCM, the solution was dried over magnesium sulfate,
and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The crude product
was purified by silica gel flash column chromatography (hexanes/ethyl
acetate 70:30) to give a yellow solid (1.50 g, yield 79%).

In the
case of the reaction between p-dimethylaminoacetophenone
and p-nitrobenzaldehyde, the typical procedure above
yielded the aldol addition product instead of the required aldol condensation
product. Thus, to complete the synthesis, the addition product (1.60
g, 5.1 mmol, 1 equiv) was dissolved in ethanol (20 mL), thereafter p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (97.0 mg, 0.51 mmol,
0.1 equiv) was added, and the solution was refluxed with stirring
for 9 h. The solvent was removed under vacuum, and the residue was
dissolved in DCM. The solution was washed with a saturated sodium
bicarbonate solution until the aqueous layer remained basic (pH ∼
9), dried over sodium sulfate, and evaporated to dryness. The resulting
disubstituted chalcone derivative was purified by silica gel flash
column chromatography (hexanes/ethyl acetate 60:40) to yield a yellow
solid (1.05 g, yield 70%).

Typical Procedure for the
Preparation of 3,5-Diarylcyclohex-2-enones
3-(4′-Aminophenyl)-5-(4-cyanophenyl)cyclohex-2-enone
[i.e., (NH2,CN)-Cyclohexenone]
The synthesis was
based on the literature procedure with some modifications.18E-1-(4′-Aminophenyl)-3-(4-cyanophenyl)prop-2-enone
(1.60 g, 6.45 mmol, 1 equiv) was dissolved in ethanol (40 mL). Methyl
acetoacetate (0.76 mL, 7.14 mmol, 1.1 equiv) and anhydrous barium
hydroxide (0.11 g, 0.63 mmol, 0.1 equiv) were added, and the solution
was stirred under reflux till TLC indicated completion of the reaction
of the chalcone (hexanes/ethyl acetate 50:50). The solvents were removed
under vacuum, and the residue (2.30 g) was dissolved in a mixture
of glacial acetic acid (46 mL) and concentrated HCl (23 mL). The solution
was refluxed with stirring for 6 h. Following cooling, the reaction
was quenched by the addition of crushed ice and the obtained solution
was extracted with chloroform. The organic layer was repeatedly washed
with saturated sodium bicarbonate until the aqueous layer remained
basic (pH ∼ 9) and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent was
removed under reduced pressure, and the crude product was purified
by flash column chromatography on silica gel (hexanes/ethyl acetate
50:50) to give a yellow solid (240 mg, yield 13%).

Substances
produced according to the typical procedure above are the following:
(OH,H)-cyclohexenone, (OH,NO2)-cyclohexenone, (NH2,NO2)-cyclohexenone, (NMe2,NO2)-cyclohexenone,
(OH,CN)-cyclohexenone, (NH2,CN)-cyclohexenone, (NMe2,CN)-cyclohexenone, and (NO2,H)-cyclohexenone.
The last three of these 3,5-diarylcyclohex-2-enones were also received
by catalysis with PS(l-Val-DPEN), as will be described, whereas
other 3,5-diarylcyclohex-2-enones mentioned later on were received
by catalysis alone. Furthermore, the racemic (NO2,H)-cyclohexenone
was used for HPLC preliminary experiments.

General Procedure for the
Heterogeneously Catalyzed Asymmetric
Robinson Annulation Reaction between Chalcones and Acetone
To a mixture of catalyst PS(l-Val-DPEN) (0.075 mmol of the
catalytic unit, 0.3 equiv) and the chalcone (0.25 mmol, 1 equiv, 0.125
M) in dry toluene (1.45 mL) were added dry acetone (0.55 mL, 7.5 mmol,
30 equiv) and benzoic acid (6.0 mg, 0.050 mmol, 0.2 equiv). The suspension
was stirred at 75 °C for 4 days. After the reaction, the mixture
was filtered and the resin was washed with ethyl acetate (×3).
The combined organic layer was evaporated, and the yield of the product
was determined by 1H NMR. When desired, the residue was
purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel (hexanes/ethyl
acetate) to afford the annulation product, whose enantiomeric excess
was determined by chiral HPLC.

General
Two-Step Protocol for Heterogeneous Catalyst Screening
Dry
acetone (0.28 mL, 3.75 mmol, 30 equiv) was added to a mixture
of the resin-supported catalyst (0.0375 mmol of the catalytic unit,
0.3 equiv), trans-(NO2,H)-chalcone (31.7
mg, 0.125 mmol, 1 equiv, 0.125 M), and benzoic acid (3.0 mg, 0.025
mmol, 0.2 equiv) in dry toluene (0.72 mL). The suspension was stirred
at 75 °C for 24 h. After the reaction, the mixture was filtered
through cotton wool (stoppering a glass pipette) directly into a measuring
cylinder. The resin was washed with chloroform until reaching the
total volume of 10.0 mL for the combined organic phase, out of which
0.5 mL (constituting 5% of the mixture) was set aside and, if determination
of the enantiomeric excess was desired, was diluted 10-fold in methanol
(HPLC grade). The diluted sample was directly injected into the HPLC
system (Chiralpak-IB column, 100% methanol, flow rate = 1.5 mL/min,
λ = 294 nm) for determining the enantiomeric excess. The remaining
organic phase was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the residue
(0.119 mmol total, 92 mM) was taken up in ethanol (1.29 mL). Tin chloride
dihydrate (0.27 g, 1.2 mmol, 10 equiv) was then added to the mixture.
The resulting solution was refluxed for 40 min and thereafter allowed
to cool slightly. The somewhat warm solution was transferred to a
measuring cylinder, and ethanol was added till the total volume of
100 mL was reached. The solution was diluted once more 10-fold in
ethanol. The final solution was used directly for fluorescence measurements
by a microplate reader (λex = 360 nm and λem = 460 nm).

Besides catalytic attempts, utilizing the
two-step protocol fully, the reduction procedure and fluorescence
measurements were also performed separately as reference experiments
for pure trans-(NO2,H)-chalcone (30.0
mg, 0.119 mmol, 92 mM) (equivalent to 0% yield in the catalytic reaction)
and for pure racemic (NO2,H)-cyclohexenone (34.8 mg, 0.1186
mmol, 92 mM) (equivalent to 100% yield in the catalytic reaction).

General One-Step Protocol for the Screening of Homogeneous Catalytic
Systems
Dry acetone (0.28 mL, 3.75 mmol, 30 equiv) was added
to a mixture of trans-(NMe2,H)-chalcone
(31.4 mg, 0.125 mmol, 1 equiv, 0.125 M), the catalyst (0.0375 mmol,
0.3 equiv of the catalytic unit), and the cocatalyst (if any, 0.00625–0.25
mmol, 0.05–2.0 equiv) in dry toluene (0.72 mL). The reaction
mixture was stirred at 75 °C for 24 h. After the reaction, 20.0
mL of chloroform was added and 0.5 mL of the combined solution was
set aside, if determination of the enantiomeric excess was desired.
The remaining solution was diluted fivefold in chloroform. This fivefold
dilution was repeated three more times. The final solution was used
directly for fluorescence measurements by a microplate reader (λex = 370 nm and λem = 460 nm).

The solution
saved for the determination of the enantiomeric excess was diluted
10-fold in methanol (HPLC grade). The final diluted solution was directly
injected into the HPLC system (Chiralpak-IB column, 100% methanol,
flow rate = 1.5 mL/min, λ = 382 nm).
