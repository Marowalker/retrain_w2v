The
addition of highly polar and aprotic cosolvents to ionic liquids
has proven to considerably decrease the viscosity of the solution
and improve mass transfer in many chemical reactions. In this work,
the interactions between a representative pyridinium-based ionic liquid, N-butylpyridinium dicyanamide ([Bpy][DCA]), and a cosolvent,
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), were studied in detail by the combined use
of attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), and density
functional theory calculations. Several species in the [Bpy][DCA]–DMSO
mixtures have been identified, that is, ion clusters can translate
into ion pairs during the dilution process. DMSO formed hydrogen bonds
(H bonds) simultaneously with [Bpy]+ cations and [DCA]− anions but stronger hydrogen-bonding interactions
with the [Bpy]+ cations than the [DCA]− anions, and the intrinsic hydrogen-bond networks of IL were difficult
to interrupt at low DMSO concentrations. Interestingly, hydrogen-bonding
interactions reach the strongest when the molar fraction of DMSO is
0.4–0.5. Hydrogen-bonding interactions are prominent in the
chemical shifts of hydrogen atoms in [Bpy]+ cations, and
anisotropy is the main reason for the upfield shifts of DMSO in the
presence of [Bpy][DCA]. The theoretical calculations offer in-depth
studies of the structural evolution and NMR calculation.

1 Introduction
Ionic
liquids (ILs) are low melting salts, thus forming liquids
that are composed entirely of cations and anions.1−4 Because of the development of
green chemistry, as well as their unique properties, and safety, environmentally
benign ILs have become the new paradigm as solvents for eliminating
the use of toxic and hazardous chemicals and also offering applications
in catalysis,5 gas separation,6−8 and other promising fields.9−12 The properties of ILs have been investigated with
particular efforts to make a better use of ILs, including their viscosity,
density, solubility, and thermal and chemical properties.13−16 It has been well-established that hydrogen-bonding interaction17 between cations and anions of ILs is one of
the key features, which has a significant influence on their properties.14,16,18−23 What is more, the presence of water,24−26 alcohol,27−29 dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO),30,31 or other cosolvents32,33 is believed to make structural changes in the hydrogen-bonding networks
of ILs, as well as their physical and chemical properties, such as
viscosity.22,32 These properties are closely
related to the applications of ILs and their binary solutions.

Among these, DMSO is a widely used cosolvent in chemical engineering
processes, completely miscible with water and a very wide range of
organic and inorganic substances.34 For
instance, adding DMSO into ILs is beneficial to the utilization of
cellulose.35 Gomes et al. reported a much
faster dissolution of cellulose when adding DMSO as a cosolvent in
[Bmim][OAc].36 As expected, DMSO decreased
the viscosity and increased the conductivity of the mixtures, thus
facilitating mass transport. The one-pot conversion of cellulose into
5-hydroxymethylfural (5-HMF) achieved a high yield in DMSO–[Bmim][AlCl4],37 and the catalytic system also
showed a promising potential in the large-scale production of 5-HMF.
Besides, Hansmeier reported that imidazolium- and pyridinium-based
ILs outperform the ILs reported so far for the removal of sulfur-
and nitrogen-containing heteroaromatics from petrochemical streams.38 It is worth noticing that aromatic cations bearing
a low viscosity and an effective mass transfer contribute to short
extraction times.39 Zhang’s work
proved that pyridinium-based ILs with [DCA]− anions
have a better extractive selectivity of sulfur compounds than those
with [SCN]− and [Tf2N]−.40 Also, pyridinium- or dicyanamide-based
ILs are scrutinized and applied in CO2 capture,41−43 while the relatively high viscosities of task-specific ILs might
limit their eventual applications in large-scale gas scrubbing.44 In this case, this problem is likely to be solved
by adding a cosolvent. Because of their unique set of properties (e.g.,
high oxygen solubility, good conductivity, large potential windows,
and so forth), ILs are also considered as electrolytes for Li–O2 batteries.45−48 Bruce et al. have shown that Li–O2 batteries based
on DMSO have a high reversibility and cell capacity,49 with only a slight decrease in the cell performance observed
after 100 cycles. Zhao improved the solubility of O2 and
the reversibility of oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution
reaction cell performance using a mixed electrolyte based on DMSO/[BMP][Tf2N].30 Furthermore, many [DCA]− anion-based ILs are shown to be suitable for several
different electrochemical applications.50−53

The works cited above have
greatly enriched our knowledge of the
superiority of IL–DMSO binary systems, and most of these research
studies have focused on their practical performance. However, limited
work has been devoted to microstructural properties and hydrogen-bonding
interactions between ILs and DMSO. Recently, the combination use of
attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(ATR–FTIR) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations
has been an effective method for shedding light on microstructural
interactions. Zheng’s work demonstrated that alkyl Calkyl–H-involved H bonds were weakened, whereas the aromatic Cring–H-involved H bonds were strengthened during the
dilution process54 and that the different
behaviors of [Bmim][BF4]–DMSO complexes may guide
us to explore their applications in cellulose dissolution and other
practices.55 Wang reported the strong anion···HOH···anion
H bonds accompanied by the H bonds between water and aromatic C–H
of [Bpy][BF4],56 which is the
first detailed spectroscopic investigation of water and a pyridinium-based
IL. The aromatic C–H group was proven to be superior to the
alkyl chain C–H group in forming H bonds both experimentally
and theoretically. To the best of our knowledge, He et al. also did
much interesting work in the field of ILs and small molecular solvents
and found that H bonds are universally involved and play an important
role for the miscibility of DMSO and [C4Py][SCN].57 Their work has enhanced our perspective on the
interactions between ILs and cosolvents. However, few works explain
why binary solutions of ILs with DMSO have superiority in application
than pure ILs or pure solvents at the molecular level.

In this
work, the hydrogen-bonding interaction between N-butylpyridinium
dicyanamide [Bpy][DCA] and DMSO (Figure 1) was investigated.
The blends of [Bpy][DCA]/DMSO across the full concentration range
from pure ILs to pure DMSO were tested, and deuterated DMSO (DMSO-d6) was used to avoid the absorption overlap
of C–H stretching bands of DMSO with that of [Bpy][DCA]. Furthermore,
the molecular interactions in these mixtures were discussed from the
results of ATR–FTIR spectroscopy, two-dimensional (2D) correlation
spectra, 1H NMR, and DFT calculations.

IL and DMSO.

2 Experimental
and Computational Methods
2.1 Chemicals and Sample Preparation
The pyridinium-based
IL [Bpy][DCA] was purchased from Linzhou Keneng Material Technology
Co, Ltd with a purity of 99 wt %. [Bpy][DCA] is a dark yellow liquid
at room temperature, and it was further dried in the vacuum oven at
348.15 K for 96 hours. Water content was measured using the Karl Fischer
coulometric titration, and the final water content was below 0.1 wt
%. The purity of [Bpy][DCA] was confirmed by 1H NMR using
a JEOL JNMECA 600 NMR spectrometer: δH (600 MHz,
DMSO, TMS/CCl4), 8.7 (2H, d, C2,6–H),
8.09 (1H, t, C4–H), 7.63 (2H, t, C3,5–H), 4.2 (2H, t, C7–H), 1.38 (2H, m, C8–H), 0.69 (2H, m, C9–H), 0.21 (3H,
t, C10–H). Also, DMSO (>99%) and DMSO-d6 (D, 99.8%) were purchased from Cambridge Isotope
Laboratories without further purification.

The binary mixtures
of [Bpy][DCA]–DMSO and [Bpy][DCA]–DMSO-d6 were prepared according to a series of molar concentrations.
The mole fractions of DMSO-d6 in the mixtures
of [Bpy][DCA]–DMSO-d6 were 0.1001,
0.1960, 0.3000, 0.3982, 0.4977, 0.5979, 0.7008, 0.7988, and 0.9004.
The mole fractions of DMSO in the binary solutions were 0.0979, 0.2030,
0.3036, 0.4001, 0.5009, 0.5999, 0.7001, 0.7994, and 0.8998. Also,
one set of experiments included two samples of pure ILs and pure small
molecular solvents (DMSO or DMSO-d6).

2.2 ATR–FTIR Spectra
To obtain the excess
absorption
spectra of the binary mixtures, ATR–FTIR spectra were collected
within the range of 4000–650 cm–1 at 298.35
K using the Nicolet 5700 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a mercury–cadmium–telluride
detector. Two horizontal ATR cells were employed in the experiments
to hold the samples. A ZnSe crystal with incident angles of 45°
and 12 reflections was applied to examine the absorbance of C–H
stretching vibration, and a Ge crystal with an incident angle of 60°
and seven reflections was applied to examine the strong absorbance
of C≡N vibration. The spectra were recorded with a resolution
of 2 cm–1, a zero filling factor of 2, and 32 parallel
scans. For each sample, three parallel measurements were carried out.
The refractive indexes of the binary solutions and the pure compound
were measured with a refractometer at 298.35 K. The formula suggested
by Hansen was used to do the ATR corrections.58

2.3 Excess Infrared and 2D Correlation Spectroscopy
The
theory of excess infrared (IR) spectroscopy had been developed by
Yu’s group,59,60 and its applications were developed
to examine the microstructures of different binary systems.28,29,55,61 The definition of excess spectrum was proposed as the difference
between the spectrums of the real solutions and those of the ideal
solutions under identical conditions. The equation of excess molar
absorbance used for the calculations was derived from the Beer–Lambert
law (eq 1) 1  where A is the absorbance of the
binary mixtures from ATR–FTIR, d is the light
path length through the ATR crystal, x1 and x2 are the
molar fractions of the two components, C1 and C2 are the molar concentrations
of the two components, and ε1* and ε2* are the ideal molar absorbance coefficients
of the two components at their pure states, respectively. εE is used to resemble the integral value of excess spectrum
within a certain range of the absorbance band. The calculations of
excess IR spectra were performed with the original data using the
MATLAB R2015b software, that is, truncation, subtraction, and baseline
correction.

2D correlation spectroscopy was proposed to investigate
the sequence of two functional groups (groups 1 and 2) interacting
with group 3.62 2D correlation spectra
were performed with 2D shige.63 In the
2D correlation map, correlation peaks on the diagonal are called automatic
peaks, and the peaks outside the diagonal are called cross-peaks.
The red and blue colors represent the positive and negative signs
of these cross-peaks, respectively [φ (v1, v2) in synchronous spectra and
ψ (v1, v2) in asynchronous spectra]. If φ (v1, v2) > 0 and ψ (v1, v2) > 0, functional
group 1 prefers over group 2 to interact with group 3; if φ
(v1, v2) >
0 and ψ (v1, v2) < 0, group 2 prefers over group 1 to interact with group
3 and vice versa.64 The synchronous and
asynchronous spectroscopies are helpful to determine the sequence
of molecular interactions between the functional groups.

2.4 1H NMR Characterizations
The 1H NMR characterizations for pure DMSO, [Bpy][DCA], and the mixtures
of [Bpy][DCA]–DMSO were conducted on a JEOL JNMECA 600 NMR
spectrometer (600 MHz) at 298.15 K. To avoid the influence of possible
interactions between the standard chemical tetramethylsilane (TMS)
and the samples, the solution of TMS in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) was chosen as the external standard.

2.5 DFT Calculations
DFT was performed to investigate the
molecular structures of [Bpy][DCA] and DMSO and the interactions between
these two components using the Gaussian 09 package.65 All geometric optimizations were carried out at the B3LYP/6-31++g(d,p)
level without an imaginary vibrational frequency, and IR frequencies
were calculated at the B3LYP/6-311++g(d,p) level. The stable structures,
interaction energies, and frequency analyses had been successfully
obtained for the cation [Bpy]+, anion [DCA]−, and ion pairs [Bpy][DCA], as well as the complexes of [Bpy][DCA]–DMSO
and ion clusters–DMSO. The interaction energy was calculated
according to eq 2 2  

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 FTIR Spectroscopy of Pure [Bpy][DCA], DMSO, and DMSO-d6
The ATR–FTIR spectra of pure
[Bpy][DCA], DMSO, and DMSO-d6 are shown
in Figure 2. The absorbance
above 3000 cm–1 (3131 cm–1 and
3058 cm–1) is attributed to the stretching vibrations
of ν(Cring–H) of the aromatic pyridinium ring;
absorbances at 2962, 2936, and 2875 cm–1 are attributed
to the stretching vibrations of ν(Calkyl–H)
of the butyl substituent of the pyridinium ring, including (−CH2−) and (−CH3) vibrations. Apart from
the main C–H vibrations of cations, the signals at 2100–2300
cm–1 show the existence of the triple bond between
the terminal N atoms and the C atom of the [DCA]− anion. According to Jürgens,66 three remarkable vibration bands at 2228, 2190, and 2128 cm–1 may be attributed to the absorbance peaks of νs(C≡N), ν(C–N), and νas(C≡N), respectively. As demonstrated by the literature,21 H bonds and electrostatic interactions are prevalent
in ILs. It is suggested that cations and anions in [Bpy][DCA] would
have hydrogen-bonding networks appearing as Cring–H···C≡N
and Calkyl–H···C≡N in pure
[Bpy][DCA].

Figure 2 ATR–FTIR spectra of [Bpy][DCA], DMSO, and DMSO-d6 in the range of 3400–2000 cm–1.

The absorbance spectrum of pure
DMSO is relatively smoother than
that of [Bpy][DCA]. Two absorption peaks at 2995 and 2912 cm–1 are assigned to νas(C–H) and νs(C–H), respectively. However, the two absorption bands
overlap with the ν(C–H) group of [Bpy]+ cations
in the range of 3200–2800 cm–1; thus, the
binary system of [Bpy][DCA]–DMSO-d6 was chosen for the analysis of ν(Calkyl–H)
and ν(Cring–H). The absorbance spectrum of
pure DMSO-d6 shows that two significant
peaks appear at 2250 and 2124 cm–1. The two bands
may overlap with ν(C≡N) of [Bpy][DCA] in the binary solutions;
thus, [Bpy][DCA]–DMSO was chosen to distinguish ν(C≡N)
from ν(C–D).

3.2 ATR–FTIR and Excess
IR Spectra Analyses
The
results of ATR–FTIR and excess IR spectra are shown in Figure 3, and the mole fractions
of IL [Bpy][DCA] are marked from 1 to 0 (top to bottom) in A, B, and
C. To avoid the intersection of excess peaks around 2130 cm–1, mole fractions of IL are marked reversely from 0 to 1 (top to bottom).
The spectra of pure [Bpy][DCA] and DMSO/DMSO-d6 are indicated by dashed lines. The partial absorbance of
ν(C–H) of the [Bpy]+ cation in the binary
solutions of [Bpy][DCA]–DMSO-d6 is depicted in Figure 3A, whereas the absorbance of ν(C≡N) of the [DCA]− anion in the mixtures of [Bpy][DCA]–DMSO is
shown in Figure 3C.
Within the range of 3200–2800 cm–1, the absorption
bands at 3131 and 3058 cm–1 may be attributed to
the vibrations of pyridinium ring C–H stretches, whereas the
three peaks with wavenumbers lower than 3000 cm–1 are attributed to the alkyl chain C–H stretches.56,57 Because of the coupling vibrations, the two bands (3131 and 3058
cm–1) cannot correspond to the specific C–H
group of the pyridinium ring. (Notice that the intensity of the absorption
bands decreases monotonically with the increase in the molar fractions
of DMSO-d6 in the systems.) Meanwhile,
when it comes to the pure DMSO-d6, almost
no absorption peaks appear in this region. As we know, H bonds are
prevalent between cations and anions in ILs,21 and ILs can easily form H bonds with other organic compounds. With
increasing DMSO-d6 concentration, the
interionic H bonds become successively weaker because of the eventual
formation of C–H···O=S between the [Bpy]+ cation and DMSO or C–D···C≡N
between DMSO-d6 and the [DCA]− anion. Consequently, the intrinsic H bonds between the cations and
the anions are weakened, resulting in the reduced strength of ν(C–H).
In general, the reduced strength of ν(C–H) is accompanied
with an elongation of C–H bond and the vibration frequency
will experience a red shift.67,68 To make a clear understanding
of the wavenumber shifts of Cring–H and Calkyl–H in the presence of DMSO-d6,
the results in Figure 3E show the wavenumber shifts of ν(Cring–H)
and ν(Calkyl–H), respectively. Besides the
absorption band at 3058 cm–1 (4.5 cm–1 red shifts), other peaks do not exhibit apparent frequency changes
during the dilution process, with less than 1 cm–1 blue shifts, which is in agreement with the literature that H bonds
involving Cring–H are proper red-shift H bonds,
whereas those related to Calkyl–H are improper red-shift
H bonds.67,68 The red shift of the band at 3058 cm–1 may be attributed to the replacement of strong interionic
H bonds between [Bpy]+ and [DCA]− by
weak long-range interactions between DMSO-d6 and [Bpy][DCA], whereas the weaker H bonds Cring–H···O=S
appear at lower vibrational frequencies. The significant red shift
implies that ν(Cring–H) 3058 cm–1 prefers to interact with DMSO-d6. It
is worthy to notice that the slight blue shifts of Calkyl–H can be attributed to two aspects. One is the formation
of blue-shift H bond by the Calkyl–H moiety itself.
The other one is that the arrangement of DMSO-d6 molecules at the top or the bottom of the pyridinium ring
causes the probable C–H···π interactions,
through which the lone-pair electrons of DMSO-d6 oxygen will transfer to the pyridinium ring. The increased
electron density will rearrange in the pyridinium cation, leading
to charge-assisted H bonds involving Calkyl–H.69 The newly emerged H-bonding interactions between
[Bpy][DCA] and DMSO-d6 can be identified
by a clear deviation from the ideal state in the excess IR spectra.
The excess IR spectra of all C–H groups are shown in Figure 3B (the dashed lines
indicate the ideal state with εE = 0), where the most obvious feature is the positive bands from both
Cring–H and Calkyl–H. It can be
seen that there are seven peaks (which can also be found in ATR–FTIR, Figure 3A) at 3131, 3081,
3058, 3015, 2962, 2936, and 2875 cm–1, with 3058
cm–1 having the greatest deviation from the ideal
state. These five positive peaks are attributed to the stretching
vibrations of Cring–H and Calkyl–H,
which indicate that the IR activities of the Cring–H
and Calkyl–H vibrations are enhanced.70 It is clear to see that one positive peak at
around 3010 cm–1 gradually becomes stronger with
the decrease of mole fractions of IL from 1 to 0, which is attributed
to the newly arisen H-bond Cring–H···O=S.
The newly arisen H bond at a lower wavenumber is thought to lead to
the obvious red shift of 3058 cm–1, which also proves
that the peak at 3058 cm–1 plays a key role in hydrogen-bonding
interactions when adding DMSO to [Bpy][DCA]. Compared with Zheng’s
work,55 the positive excess peaks indicate
that both pyridinium Cring–H- and Calkyl–H-involved H bonds are enhanced when interacting with DMSO-d6, whereas the excess IR spectra show both positive
and negative peaks for Cring–H of imidazolium-based
ILs. According to the study reported previously,21 the presence of two electron-withdrawing N atoms in the
imidazolium ring makes C2–H much more acidic than C4,5–H,
and C2–H will act as the key site of the H-bond donor. Although
the charge difference in the pyridinium Cring–H
is not as significant as that in the imidazolium ring, the acidity
of all pyridinium H atoms is small and all Cring–H
can act as the H-bond donors to interact with DMSO-d6. The charge difference between [Bmim]+ and
[Bpy]+ performed by a natural population analysis can be
found in Figure S8.71 In addition, the two alkyl chains of the imidazolium cation
make DMSO-d6 spatially infeasible to approach
C2–H, whereas the pyridinium cation contains only one alkyl
chain, resulting in DMSO-d6 preferring
to interact with the anions of imidazolium ILs but with both cations
and anions in the case of pyridinium ILs.56 Therefore, adding DMSO-d6 evidently
weakened interionic H bonds in imidazolium-based ILs but did not significantly
affect the H bonds involving pyridinium Cring–H.
Meanwhile, the pyridinium ring can form more H bonds with DMSO-d6 because of more H-bond donors. Consequently,
an apparent decrease in interionic H bonds and an increase in the
ion pair–DMSO interactions in imidazolium-based ILs can occur,
which is related to the negative and positive bands in Zheng’s
work. However, in this study, the electrons of cations distribute
at a uniform density, and the addition of DMSO will lead to the enhanced
IR activity of almost all C–H bonds of [Bpy][DCA], as well
as increase the number of H bonds involving the pyridinium ring. The
results can be shown by the observable positive excess peaks in the
respective C–H vibrational modes.

excess IR (B), indicating the spectra of
C–H stretching vibrations in [Bpy][DCA]/DMSO-d6 mixtures from 3200 to 2800 cm–1, and

in [Bpy][DCA]/DMSO mixtures from 2300 to 2050 cm–1. E and F showing the wavenumber shifts of C–H and C≡N
vibrations during the dilution, respectively.

In the 2300–2050 cm–1 region, DMSO
does
not absorb, and strong absorption bands are observed from the [DCA]− anion of [Bpy][DCA]. Three stretching vibrations at
2228, 2190, and 2128 cm–1 may be attributed to the
typical signals of νas(C≡N), ν(C–N),
and νs(C≡N), respectively (Figure 3C).66,72 The most obvious feature is that the absorption intensity of the
three bands decreases with the addition of DMSO. Because the intensity
of the positive bands near 2130 cm–1 gradually increases
with decreasing mole fractions of [Bpy][DCA], sequences of excess
IR spectra in Figure 3D are reversed in comparison with that in Figure 3C for avoiding the intersection of these
bands. The wavenumber shifts of ν(C≡N) are shown in Figure 3F, and all of the
C≡N group experiences a monotonic red shift. It has been suggested
that [DCA]− can form H bonds with the C–H
groups of DMSO that are weaker than those of the intrinsic H-bond
networks of IL;57,73,74 the positive and negative peaks in excess IR Figure 3D at the fixed positions (nearly fixed zero
point) are attributed to Cring/Calkyl–H···C≡N
and CDMSO–H···C≡N. The positive
peak near 2225 cm–1 indicating CDMSO–H···C≡N
appears at a lower wavenumber than the negative peaks indicating H
bonds between the cations and the anions. These results also suggest
that the formation of CDMSO–H···C≡N
gives rise to the red shift of C≡N vibrations (shown in Figure 3F). The addition
of DMSO would have a positive effect on the formation of H bonds,
especially when the mole fraction of DMSO is around 0.4–0.5.
With the help of excess IR spectra, the newly emerged H-bond species
can be identified, which strongly support the wavenumber shifts in
the ATR–IR spectra.

3.3 Analysis of 2D Correlation
Spectra
The sequential order
of the interactions of Cring–H and Calkyl–H with DMSO can be evaluated by the 2D correlation spectra.
The presence of DMSO-d6 results in a different
chemical environment for the C–H groups in the [Bpy][DCA]–DMSO-d6 system. The synchronous and asynchronous spectra
are shown in Figure 4. There are more correlation bands in the asynchronous spectrum (Figure 4B) than in the synchronous
spectrum (Figure 4A)
because the asynchronous cross-peaks result from the relative dissimilarity
of the intensity variation behavior. Specifically, two main cross-correlation
peaks are observed in Figure 4B, located at (3058 cm–1 and 2945 cm–1) and (3031 cm–1 and 2950 cm–1). The two central peaks are taken as the representative
absorptions for Cring–H and Calkyl–H
groups. Positive cross-peaks at (3058 cm–1 and 2945
cm–1) and (3031 cm–1 and 2950
cm–1) are seen in the synchronous spectrum because
of the same changing direction of the absorption coefficients of Cring–H and Calkyl–H. In the asynchronous
spectrum, the cross-peaks at (3058 cm–1 and 2945
cm–1) and (3031 cm–1 and 2950
cm–1) are also positive. Thus, the signs of both
synchronous and asynchronous cross-peaks are the same. According to
Noda’s rule,64,75 DMSO prefers over the alkyl chain
for interacting with the pyridinium ring. The results are consistent
with the wavenumber shifts, and Cring–Hs are more
susceptible to the dilution process.

and asynchronous (B,
−0.20–0.20) correlation spectra contour maps of [Bpy][DCA]/DMSO-d6 mixtures in the 3100–2850 cm–1 region. The red and blue regions represent the positive and negative
response signals, respectively.

3.4 1H NMR Analysis
Assignment
of the 1H NMR signals to the hydrogen atoms of pure [Bpy][DCA]
is displayed
in Figure 5A (black
line), and the chemical shift changes of individual hydrogen atoms
during the dilution process are evaluated in Figure 5B (Cring–H), 5C (Calkyl–H), and 5D (DMSO). The chemical shift of all hydrogen atoms in [Bpy]+ cations gradually moves downfield with increasing mole concentrations
of DMSO (from top to bottom), whereas the hydrogen atoms in DMSO move
upfield with increasing mole concentrations of IL [Bpy][DCA] (from
bottom to top) in Figure 5A. The chemical shift variation (Δδ) is expressed
by the differences between the chemical shifts of the mixtures and
those of the pure chemicals. The chemical shift variations are C2,6–H (0.28 ppm), C4–H (0.34 ppm),
C3,5–H (0.35 ppm), C7–H (0.27
ppm), CDMSO–H (−0.31 ppm), C8–H
(0.35 ppm), C9–H (0.42 ppm), and C10–H
(0.49 ppm). As can be seen, both Cring–H and Calkyl–H have positive Δδ values of hydrogen
atoms in Figure 5B,
C, in contrast to the negative Δδ values of hydrogen atoms
on the methyl groups of DMSO in Figure 5D. This proves that hydrogen atoms of the [Bpy]+ cation show downfield shifts with the addition of DMSO to
[Bpy][DCA], whereas the hydrogen atoms of DMSO experience upfield
shifts with increasing mole concentrations of [Bpy][DCA]. It is well-known
that the hydrogen atoms show positive chemical shifts and move downfield
when they are attracted by electron-withdrawing groups to form H bonds;76−78 thus, the 1H NMR data undoubtedly demonstrate that the
addition of DMSO significantly influences hydrogen-bonding interactions
between the cations and the anions of [Bpy][DCA], and both Calkyl–H and Cring–H can form H bonds with DMSO.
With the changes in proportions of [Bpy][DCA]/DMSO, the electrostatic
environment around the ionic cations and anions is changed. The interactions
between the cations and DMSO, anions and DMSO, and cations and anions
slightly change the environment around the C–H groups, resulting
in the changes in the chemical shifts of hydrogen atoms in 1H NMR. This observation supports our previous determination that
the excess IR of H bonds involving the hydrogen atoms of [Bpy]+ is strengthened with the newly emerged Cring–H···O=S
and Calkyl–H···O=S H bonds,
and the presence of ILs weakens the self-associated H-bond networks
of DMSO. However, hydrogen-bonding interactions are not the main reason
for the upfield shift of hydrogen atoms of DMSO, which can be explained
by the shielding effects when the methyl group of DMSO is located
above the aromatic pyridinium ring.55

binary systems.

3.5 DFT Calculations
of Interactions between [Bpy][DCA] and DMSO
All of the structures
were optimized using the DFT theory at the
B3LYP/6-31++g(d,p) level. The angles of C–H···N
and C–H···O are all between 90° and 180°,
and the sums of the van der Waals radii of H and N atoms(2.75 Å)
and H and O atoms(2.72 Å)79 are applied
as criteria for the formation of H bonds between the donors and the
acceptors.

The electrostatic potential surfaces of the individual
cation, anion, and DMSO are shown in Figure 6, where the blue-colored surfaces represent
the positive electrostatic potential and the red-colored surfaces
represent the negative electrostatic potential. As can be seen in
this figure, all regions around the [Bpy]+ cation are positive
electrostatic potential, and because of its darker blue-colored surface,
the positive charges are more concentrated surrounding the pyridinium
ring than the alkyl chain. Obviously, negative charges are more uniformly
dispersed around the [DCA]− anion. In the structure
of DMSO, the negative electrostatic potential is distributed mainly
around the oxygen atoms, with a less positive charge around the two
methyl groups. The positive and negative electrostatic potential plays
an important role in the formation of H bonds.

[DCA]−, and (C) DMSO (Isov = 0.0004).

A series of possible geometrics of [Bpy][DCA] ion
pairs are optimized
using the DFT theory (Figure S1A–C). The anions formed H bonds with the hydrogen atoms of the pyridinium
ring and the butyl chain simultaneously, and the [DCA]− anion would appear directly above the pyridinium ring (Figure S1C). In addition, the hydrogen atoms
of the pyridinium ring have stronger hydrogen-bonding abilities than
Calkyl–H because of their larger interaction energy
(317 kJ/mol > 305.89 kJ/mol). In the complexes of the [Bpy]+ cation and DMSO (Figure S1D–F), it is found that the interaction energies of structures D (74.25
kJ/mol) and E (73.20 kJ/mol) are larger in absolute values than the
interaction in structure F (59.13 kJ/mol), indicating that complexes
D and E are more stable than F. The difference between the interaction
energy is explained by the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent
nitrogen atom. The results of the interaction between the [DCA]− anion and DMSO (Figure S1G, H) are distinct from the cation–DMSO, in which the methyl group
of DMSO is most favorable for forming H bonds with the [DCA]− anion because of the electron deficit in the methyl group. Comparing
the interaction energies of [Bpy]+–DMSO and [DCA]−–DMSO, all of the [Bpy]+–DMSO
complexes have larger absolute values of interaction energies than
those of [DCA]−–DMSO, indicating that the
interaction between DMSO and the [Bpy]+ cation is stronger
than that between the [DCA]− anion and DMSO. What
is more, owing to the strong electrostatic attraction, the interaction
energy of [Bpy][DCA] is much larger than those of [Bpy]+–DMSO and [DCA]−–DMSO complexes.

The complexes of [Bpy][DCA]–DMSO are shown in Figure S2. It has been found that the electrostatic
interaction of the [Bpy]+ cation and the [DCA]− anion is always dominant in the presence of a low mole fraction
of DMSO, and the ion pair structures are not interrupted by the DMSO
molecules. Both the S=O and methyl groups participate in the
hydrogen-bonding interaction, wherein S=O prefers to interact
with the H atoms of the [Bpy]+ cation, and the methyl group
preferentially forms H bonds with the N atom of the [DCA]− anion. It is obvious that the H bonds between Cring–H
and DMSO lead to a larger interaction energy (371.96 kJ/mol in Figure S2C) than that between alkyl C–H
and DMSO (348.05 kJ/mol in Figure S2A),
which in turn implies that the favorable interaction sites for [Bpy][DCA]–DMSO
complexes are the Cring–H and [DCA]− anions. The interaction energies in Figure S2B and D are relatively high mainly because of the anion−π
interaction between [Bpy]+ and [DCA]−.

To validate the dilution process, the larger complex consisting
of two [Bpy]+ cations and two [DCA]− anions
was selected as the ion cluster structure in high IL concentrations.78,80−82 The geometrics of the ion cluster are shown in Figure S3. The cations and anions are uniformly
cross-arranged, and both terminal nitrogen atoms of the [DCA]− anions form double H bonds with the adjacent [Bpy]+ cations. The interaction between the ion cluster and DMSO
is considered in Figure S3B, where DMSO
can form H bonds with [Bpy][DCA]. However, a small amount of DMSO
only attacks the structure on the side of the cluster and is not strong
enough to deconstruct the strong interaction between the cations and
the anions, which makes the cluster complex stable and a stronger
hydrogen-bonding interaction at xDMSO =
0.4–0.5. The topology analysis was employed for the two clusters
in Figure S3, and the results are shown
in Table S1 and Figure S4. The topology structures show the existence of bond critical
points between the two atoms. To some extent, the lengths of the H
bonds (C5–H11···N57, C12–H14···N57,
C30–H37···N58, C41–H42···N58,
C34–H40···N28, C41–H43···N28,
C1–H8···N29, and C12–H13···N29)
in the cluster 2[Bpy]+–2[DCA]− were elongated after adding DMSO. Meanwhile, the electron density
(ρBCP) at these H-bond critical points decreased,
and ρBCP increased at C60–H63···N58,
C64–H66···N58, and C31–H38···O68,
which resulted from the interaction between DMSO and the IL cluster.
The higher ρBCP (0.281 au) and negative ∇2ρBCP (−1.017 au) also indicate the covalent characteristic
of the H-bond C64–H66···N58. With the increased
mole fractions of DMSO in the [Bpy][DCA]–DMSO binary system,
more DMSO is involved in the formation of H bonds with ILs, and the
big clusters are dissociated to ion pairs. The completed destruction
of ion pairs occurs at very high concentrations of DMSO.

Apart
from the structure analysis, a comparison between the experimental
IR spectrum and the vibration modes of the two clusters is shown in Figure 7. To represent the
binary solutions, [Bpy][DCA]/DMSO was selected with the mole fraction
of xIL = 0.9, denoted by the solid line.
The calculated clusters [Bpy]+–[DCA]−–DMSO (Figure S2B) and 2[Bpy]+–2[DCA]−–DMSO (Figure S3B) may become microscopic models to
describe the structures in their real solutions, denoted by the dashed
lines. It should be noted that the frequencies were scaled by dividing
the maximum value of each set of data to make the intensity comparable.17,83 It is clearly seen that the main features of the measured spectra
of [Bpy][DCA]/DMSO are reproduced by the DFT-calculated vibrational
frequencies. Because of some uncertainties of theoretical methods,
the peaks of the main C–H vibrational bands (3131, 3081, 2962,
2936, and 2875 cm–1) and C≡N vibrational
bands (2228 cm–1 and 2128 cm–1) are sharper than the experimental results,84 especially for DMSO interacting at a higher IL concentration (2[Bpy]+–2[DCA]−–DMSO). The strong
agreement with the major bands provided by DFT calculations and experimental
measurements can also be assigned rationally by the structures of
these theoretical clusters.17

Figure 7 Measured ATR–FTIR
spectra of [Bpy][DCA]/DMSO (xIL = 0.9)
at 298.35 K compared to the vibrational frequencies
of the corresponding clusters [Bpy]+–[DCA]−–DMSO and 2[Bpy]+–2[DCA]−–DMSO calculated at the B3LYP/6-311++g(d,p) level of the theory
(all of the calculated bands were corrected by the factor 0.96385).

The chemical shift of the hydrogen atoms in the binary system
was
also investigated using DFT calculations. Because the structure in Figure S2B was optimized from Figure S1A, the two complexes were selected to perform the
NMR calculation, with the results of the chemical shifts in the experimental
and theoretical calculations compared in Table 1. As summarized in this table, all of the
hydrogen atoms of the [Bpy]+ cation exhibit a downfield
shift in the presence of DMSO, and the hydrogen atoms of DMSO exhibit
an upfield shift in the presence of [Bpy][DCA]. The theoretical data
are in good agreement with the experimental results, indicating that
the newly emerged hydrogen-bonding interactions between [Bpy][DCA]
and DMSO are the foremost reason for the positive chemical shift variations
of the cationic hydrogen atoms and that the anisotropy effect of the
pyridinium ring serves prominently to explain the negative chemical
shift of DMSO. Another thing worth mentioning is that the calculated
chemical shifts have the same trend with the experimental data but
differ in specific values, which may be explained by the difference
between the bulk property and the local quality at the molecular level.

4 Conclusions
In this
work, the hydrogen-bonding interactions between the components
in the binary solutions consisting of [Bpy][DCA] and DMSO were studied
using ATR–FTIR spectroscopy, 1H NMR, and DFT calculation.
It may be concluded that the [Bpy]+ cation-involved hydrogen-bonding
interactions are enhanced during the dilution process. With the addition
of DMSO, the number of C–H···N≡C H bonds
between the cations and the anions is reduced rather than the newly
formed H bonds C–H···O=S between the
cations and DMSO and C–H···C≡N between
both the methyl group of DMSO and anions. DMSO molecules preferentially
have a stronger interaction with the [Bpy]+ cations than
the [DCA]− anions, and the ring C–Hs are
stronger hydrogen donors than the alkyl C–Hs. Consequently,
quantum chemical calculations suggest that intrinsic hydrogen-bond
networks are difficult to interrupt by a low concentration of DMSO
but can be dissociated from big ion clusters to small ion pairs and
even to separated ions at extremely high concentrations of DMSO. In
addition, the theoretical data of 1H NMR are in agreement
with the experimental results, showing that hydrogen-bonding interactions
are prominent in determining the downfield shift of hydrogen atoms
of the [Bpy]+ cation and that the location of DMSO in the
shielding cone of the pyridinium ring is responsible for the upfield
shift of the methyl group in DMSO. The in-depth study of the hydrogen-bonding
interaction between [Bpy][DCA] and DMSO deepens our understanding
of the properties of binary systems, which may further inspire chemists
to explore the applications of ILs.
