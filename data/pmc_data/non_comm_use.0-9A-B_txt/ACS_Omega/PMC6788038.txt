Solid
phononic crystal (PnC) lenses were made active on infiltration with
thermosensitive polymers to produce a thermoactuated hybrid solid
lens with variable focusing. Acoustic lenses, both solid state and
PnCbased, are passive elements with a fixed focal length. Their focal
characteristics are functions of the lens structure or the arrangement
of the PnC unit cell. Dispersion effects, liquid-filled membranes,
and phase delay in a multi-element emitter have been used for variable
focusing. The high thermal, electric, and electromagnetic sensitivity
of the elastic properties of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm)-based hydrogels enable them
to operate as tunable solids. However, these solids do not have strong
enough contrast with water or well-controlled shape parameters to
function as standalone lenses. Here, a tunable hybrid solid ultrasonic
lens is realized by combining a PnC lens with PVA-PNIPAm thermoacoustic
hydrogel to modify the transmission and dispersion properties of transient
acoustic waves. Variable focusing is demonstrated from 40 to 50 mm
using the anomalous thermosensitivity of the elasticity and speed
of sound of the hydrogel.

Introduction
Phononic or sonic crystals (PnCs, SCs)
allow the fabrication of artificial structures from the composites
of a periodically arranged material embedded within a medium with
a large elastic contrast. The modification of the density, elastic
parameters, and hylemorphic features, such as the size, shape, and
arrangement of scatterers in the PnC strongly changes the behavior
of transient mechanical or acoustic waves through the crystal. Controlling
any of the properties enables functional material systems that may
behave as filters,1 cloaks,2 negative index lenses,3 and
negative mass density4 amongst other unique
behaviors.5

The earliest demonstrations
of phononic or sonic lenses utilized the linear dispersion region
of the periodic band structure to create an effective medium to focus
sound.6−8 At low frequencies below the homogenization limit,
the SC behaves as a homogenous object, where the filling fraction
of the heterostructure scatterers combined with the contrast in elastic
properties produces an effective index of refraction that results
in the refraction sound. PnC lenses operating in the linear dispersion
regime are governed by the same geometric optic laws of a traditionally
homogeneous optical lens with the added advantage that the effective
index of refraction can be readily controlled.9 The ability to artificially control the bulk material properties
makes the structures particularly exciting for their potential impacts
in biomedical imaging and ultrasonic microscopy.

Focusing of
mechanical waves, which include acoustic waves, is accomplished using
either lenses, curved emission sources, or phased array elements.
Lenses and curved emission sources generally have a single focal point
determined by their geometry (curvature, thickness) and mechanical
characteristics. Moreover, the focal length of mechanical wave emission
sources such as transducers is restricted to the Fresnel zone where
the emitted waves behave as a planar. Ideally, however, the geometry
of a lens allows for an arbitrarily long focal length, which extends
the characterization capabilities of ultrasound in both organic and
inorganic systems.

Whereas the focal length of solid lenses
and curved emission sources is typically fixed, other mechanisms have
been used to vary the focal length of an emission source. Phased array
emission varies the focal length by dictating the location of the
constructive phase interference between sound waves emitted from spatially
separated elements. Yin et al. demonstrated dynamic focusing by obtaining
the transfer function of a randomly scattering lens, then modulating
an input pulse transient profile to shift its focal point.10 Variable focusing has also been accomplished
with fluidic lenses that pneumatically change the shape of a fluid-filled
membrane.11,12 Pneumatically changing the filling volume
of the lens results in a lens with a dynamic radius, and thus a variable
focal length.13 For reflective focusing,
metasurfaces have been used to induce a dispersive phase interference,
resulting in a frequency dependent focal length.14 Unlike both fluidic lenses and phased array sources, metasurfaces
and transfer function-based tuning are frequency modulated.

In prior works, we have demonstrated the control and modulation of
acoustic waves through PnC by electromagnetic waves to realize active
ultrasonic filters and modulators.15,16 In this work,
a new mechanism is presented to actively tune the focal point of a
solid acoustic lens. The lens is comprised of a PnC lens embedded
with a stimulus sensitive polymer, poly(vinyl alcohol) poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (PVA-PNIPAm) hydrogel. The PnC lens
is solid, but the modulation of its focal length is achieved through
thermally induced elastic property changes in the hydrogel component.
Unlike prior approaches of tunable acoustic lens or sources, the variation
in the focal length is not frequency modulated, a function of geometric
optics, or phase coherence, but instead utilizes the modification
in its intrinsic mechanical properties to realize a tunable solid
lens.

Results
Tunable Lens Design and Fabrication
A PVA-PNIPAm hydrogel is a stimulus sensitive polymer with mechanical
properties that are anomalously dependent on temperature.17 At the lower critical solution temperature (LCST)
of ∼32 °C, the hydrogel undergoes a discontinuous volumetric
phase transition as it goes from a hydrophilic to hydrophobic state.
The result is mechanical properties that also demonstrate strong variance.
The contrast in the change of speed of sound between water and hydrogel
allows for the effects due to the hydrogel being easily distinguished.
Based on the definition, neff = c/v where c is the speed
of sound in the ambient medium, and v is the speed
of sound in the hydrogel, the effective refractive index, neff, ranges from 1.12 to 1.06 (Figure 1a). As water is the ambient
medium in this work, the anomalous change in the speed of sound near
the phase transition temperature is strongly represented in the effective
index.

Figure 1 (a) Temperature dependent speed of sound for PVA-PNIPAm and water
(left axis) and effective index of refraction for hydrogel derived
from ref (17). PVA-PNIPAm
undergoes a discontinuous volumetric phase transition at ∼32
°C resulting in an anomalous increase in the speed of sound,
density, Poisson’s ratio, and ultrasonic index of refraction.
The (b–d) microscopy image of PVA-PNIPAm at room temperature
(b), 31 (c), and 39 °C (d). The increasing density of the cross-link
polymers is clearly seen with increasing temperature. (e) Young’s
modulus indicates the strong increase in stiffness above the LCST.

Ideally, PVA-PNIPAm and variants could serve as
standalone acoustic lenses. Their tunable elastic characteristics,
specifically speed of sound, make them materials with effective acoustic
index of refraction that is variable under an external stimulus. However,
the volumetric phase transition associated with the stimulus induced
changes make maintaining a controlled shape for lensing challenging. Figure 1b–d show the
compression of the hydrogel at below, near, and above the LCST. Shrinkage
above the LCST occurs because of NIPA polymer chains shedding bonds
with free water molecules, expelling them from the cross-linked network,
to self-bond. The process is thermodynamically repeatable and reversible.
However, additional time for equilibrium when going from a hydrophobic
to hydrophilic state is necessary because the adsorption time of water
molecules into the bulk gel network. The selection of PVA-PNIPAm over
pure PNIPAm was due to the faster and more dramatic elastic and volumetric
changes in the PVA-PNIPAm synthesized bulk hydrogels as investigated
internally reported elsewhere.16 The same
work also details the reversibility of the process by turning on/off
an electromagnetic stimulus and mapping the time-dependent dispersion.
The synthesis procedures are given in the Materials
and Methods section.

The challenges of maintaining a
controlled shape were best addressed by combining the hydrogel with
a more stable structure. A PnC lens, which maintains an effective
index based on the periodicity, composition, and filling fraction
of the lattice, was used to provide a stable framework for the hydrogels.9 By filling the interstitial lattice spacing with
hydrogel, the tunable index of refraction is readily leveraged for
tunable focusing. The strongly anomalous in stiffness as indicated
by the Young’s modulus also affects the elastic contrast between
the stainless steel scatterers and the hydrogel, further enabling
the tuning of transmission (Figure 1e).

PNIPAm hydrogels occupy a unique physical
state between liquid and solid due to their hydrophilic and hydrophobic
nature.18 At the LCST of ∼32 °C,
PNIPAm-based hydrogels undergo a volumetric phase change caused by
the transition between hydrophilicity below the LCST and hydrophobicity
above the LCST.18 In the hydrophilic state,
hydrogels can readily be comprised of greater than 90 wt % water with
a density nearly equal that of water, and a speed of sound equal to
water at frequencies above 1 MHz. The center frequency of the emission
source used in this work, however, is 0.5 MHz, and dispersion causes
the hydrogels to have a lower speed of sound in this frequency range.17

The selection of a planoconvex design
for the lens was based on the limitations of the fabrication techniques,
available characterization resources, finite element modeling (FEM)
software COMSOL, and the ability to utilize PVA-PNIPAm for tunable
focusing. The band structure of the PnC was calculated and a frequency
range selected that coincided both with the first transmission band
and capabilities of utilized emission and detection sources (Figure 2a). Within the first
band, the PnC behaves as an effective medium, allowing for the basic
principles of geometric optics to be used to guide the design of the
lens. A plano-convex was selected, simulated in COMSOL to verify the
existence of focusing within a measurable region, and experimentally
verified at 215 kHz both below and above the phase transition temperature
of the hydrogel. For water, the temperature does not discernably shift
the focus of the lens either numerically or experimentally as shown
in Figure 3.

Figure 2 (a) Band structure
calculated using the RBZ for the base, square lattice PnC in PVA PNIPAm
ambient. Tunable focusing is demonstrated in the first transmission
band. (b) Top view of the PnC lens both with (left) and without (right).

Figure 3 Modeled (a,c) and measured (b,d) sound fields of the PnC
lens without hydrogel at room temperature (a,b) and 39 °C (c,d).
The experimental measurements start about 20 mm from the surface of
the lens in contrast to the modeled measurement which shows the entire
sound field. The discrepancy is due to the overhang of the lens-stabilizing
plate. The increasing temperature in water does not discernably shift
the focus of the phononic lens.

The device is composed of a PnC lens operating in water ambient with
the thermosensitive polymer, PVA PNIPAm interstitially filling the
spacing between the PnC scatterers (Figure 2b). The lens was fabricated from a square
lattice of stainless steel cylindrical rods of radius 0.80 mm and
lattice constant, a, of 1.96 mm. PVA-PNIPAm was synthesized
using free radical polymerization to form a bulk hydrogel, and filled
into the PnC lattice spacing following the procedure from other works.16 The lens was formed by first polymerizing the
hydrogel in a 10 × 20 period PnC, where the thickness is 10 periods
along the direction of wave propagation, then rods and hydrogel removed
to form a lens with a radius ∼10a.

Discussion
The ultrasound velocity of PVA-PNIPAm was measured to be 1341 m/s
at 22 °C, 1415 at 34 °C, and 1426 m/s at 39 °C, respectively.
As the speed of sound is indicative of the elastic properties of a
material, the abrupt increase in the speed of sound (Figure 1a) has been related to the
increased elastic stiffness and higher density.18,19 In a hybrid PnC structure, modulating the phase of the hydrogel
thus will impact the effective medium of the lens, leading to tuning
of its behavior. From Figure 1a, it is apparent that though the speed of sound in water
increases with temperature, the gradual increase is much less than
that of PVA-PNIPAm. Moreover, the temperature-dependent volumetric
phase transition of the polymer enables a unique way of modifying
the focal length of the polymer-infiltrated lens reversibly.

Figures 3 and 4 show the temperature-dependent behavior of the
phononic lens both with (Figure 4) and without (Figure 3) hydrogel. For clarity, the lens without hydrogel
is termed the sonic lens (SL), and with hydrogel termed the tunable
SL (TSL). At room temperature, the SL has a focal point of 25 mm.
An increase of the water temperature from 20 to 39 °C has a negligible
effect on focusing length as observed from Figure 3a–d. Over this temperature range,
the speed of sound in water increases from 1484 m/s at 20 °C
to 1524 m/s at 39 °C, an increase of roughly 2.6% while the hydrogel
anomalously increases 6.3%. In addition to the change in the speed
of sound, the density and bulk modulus also maintain a discontinuous
dependence on temperature.17 Prior works
have shown that heating water does cause blueshift of the dispersion
curve towards higher frequencies, but the shift does not necessarily
change the relative dispersion relation that strongly impacts the
effective index of refraction of the lens.6,9,16

Figure 4 Experimentally measured sound field of the tunable
lens at room temperature (a), 20 °C, the LCST at 31 °C (b),
and (c) above the LCST at 39 °C. (d) Lens focuses to 50 mm at
room temperature below the LCST to ∼40 mm above it.

The acoustic wave propagation through the SL is significantly
modified because of the infiltration of the hydrogel polymer within
the matrix as shown in Figure 3. It can be observed that at 20 °C, which is far below
the LCST, the lens has a significantly longer focal length of 50 mm
compared to ambient water at the same temperature. The focal length
undergoes shifting as the hydrogel undergoes its phase transition,
reducing to ∼46 mm as the temperature approaches the phase
transition temperature around 31 °C. As the temperature is further
increased above LCST to 39 °C, the focal length increases to
40 mm (Figure 4).

The temperature-dependent behavior of the focal length of the hybrid
SL due to the modification of the phase of the polymer can be explained
by studying the acoustic properties of the PVA-PNIPAm used as an active
material of the lens. The speed of sound in PVA-PNIPAm and hydrogels
can be highly dependent on the frequency of the acoustic wave.17 Additionally, hydrogels not only undergo an
anomalous change in the speed of sound with temperature, but also
density, Poisson ratio, and other mechanical properties like stiffness.18 As the dispersion relation is dependent on the
contrast in the elastic parameters between the stainless steel scatterers
and the hydrogel that interstitially fills the lattice spacing, the
anomalous behavior of the elastic properties of the hydrogel with
temperature more strongly impact the effective index of refraction
and thus the focal length.

For the current work, the sound field
was measured using a needle hydrophone that was raster scanned, requiring
significant amounts of time for complete data acquisition. Resistive
strips were used to heat the water in ambient temperature and maintain
a constant temperature throughout the measurement. Neither the raster
scanning nor temperature control mechanisms were adequate to test
the rate at which the focus could be manipulated in situ. However,
the ideal limit to the rate of tuning is a function of speed at which
a hydrogel can undergo its phase transition and the penetration of
the stimulus through the entire device. Changes of 75% swelling/deswelling
have been achieved for PNIPAm-based hydrogels in nearly 1 s with an
electrical stimulus.20 Incorporation of
fast-switching PNIPAm composites with an associated stimulus would
result in tunable focusing on the scale of seconds. Further developments
would be necessary in fast-switching polymers to approach tuning speeds
of the current phased array scanning systems.

Tunable focusing
for acoustic waves is currently achieved primarily through phase delay
in phased array emitters and pneumatic, fluid-filled membrane lenses.
The hydrogel-filled PnC lens differs from both in that it is completely
solid. The discontinuous nature of the volumetric phase transition
in PNIPAm-based hydrogels leads to variable focusing because of the
strong dependence of the mechanical properties on temperature and
frequency. Though temperature is used as the control in this work,
hydrogels have been actuated electrically,21 magnetically,21 with pH,18 and even through biomimetic stress.22 The result is a solid lens that can be controlled using
various stimuli.

Conclusions
The ability to control
the band structure of PnCs has resulted in distinct advantages compared
to traditional homogenous structures. For example, cloaking,23 super resolution,3 focusing of elastic waves,24 flat lenses,25 and self-collimation26 uniquely derive their properties from the wavevector manipulation
only achievable due to wave propagation in periodic structures. Techniques
dynamically changing the point of focus for an ultrasonic wave currently
include pneumatically-actuated, liquid-filled membranes, or phase
delay to achieve tunable focusing. Currently, a solid object cannot
change the focal length of an ultrasonic wave without also changing
the frequency. Here, we presented the first tunable hybrid ultrasonic
solid lens that has a dynamic focal range of 25% when shifting from
a focal length of 40 mm at 39 °C to 50 mm at 20 °C. The
lens is comprised of a square lattice stainless steel PnC with the
stimulus sensitive, thermoacoustic hydrogel, PVA-PNIPAm, interstitially
filling the spacing between the scatterers, and functions in water
ambient at ultrasonic frequencies.

Materials and Methods
FEM Modeling
FEM software COMSOL was utilized to model the PnC lens as pressure
waves solved via the Helmholtz equation coupled to solid mechanics
for numerical analysis. In addition to water, the physical properties
of PVA-PNIPAm hydrogel such as density, speed of sound, bulk, and
Young’s modulus, and Poisson ratio were measured and previously
reported,17 and implemented into the COMSOL
model. The emission source comprised an incident wave, perpendicular
to the lens optical axis, and the simulations were performed at room
temperature (20 °C) and 39 °C. As the filling fraction of
the hydrogel is not 100% in either the hydrophilic or hydrophobic
state experimentally, FEM modeling was utilized only to qualitatively
determine if shifting would occur in the ideal case of 100% filling
fraction.

Hybrid Lens
The device is composed of a PnC lens operating
in water ambient with the thermosensitive polymer, PVA PNIPAm interstitially
filling the spacing between the PnC scatterers (Figure 2b). The lens was fabricated from a square
lattice of stainless steel cylindrical rods of radius 0.80 mm and
lattice constant, a, of 1.96 mm. PVA-PNIPAm was synthesized
using free radical polymerization to form a bulk hydrogel. A 400 g
tub of monomer solution of the PVA-PNIPAm monomer solution was
made by magnetically stirring N-isopropylacrylamide
(NIPA, Polysciences, Inc.), N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide
(BIS, Polysciences, Inc), and a 5% DI water diluted PVA (Polysciences,
Inc.) solution in ratios of 0.10 (wt): 0.02 (mol. NIPA): 0.84 (wt)
at 70 °C for >24 h.

To interstitially fill the spacing
of the hybrid lens, a 10 × 20 period PnC was placed in the monomer
solution in a sealed container. The entire container was then placed
in an ice bath, with N2 continuously pumped into the monomer
solution while being magnetically stirred on high speed for >30
min. The ammonium persulfate initiator and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-ethylenediamine
accelerator solutions were made by mixing with water in ratios of
0.1 (APS, TEMED)/0.9 (H2O). The initiator and accelerator
were then injected into the container with the monomer solution and
PnC. Injection occurred in a N2 atmosphere until the hydrogel
polymerized. For final preparation, the impinging surfaces of the
PnC were cleared of the PVA-hydrogel and rods and hydrogel removed
to form a hybrid lens with a radius ∼10a.

Measurements
Measurements were performed in a bistatic thru-transmission
arrangement in a 51 cm × 51 cm × 46 cm acrylic tank. The
emitting transducer was at the plane side of the plano-convex lens,
and a needle hydrophone detector scanned over the output area of the
lens. Transmission was measured with both pulsed and continuous wave
emission in separate experiments to evaluate qualitative reliability
and reproducibility.

The emitting source was a Panametrics V301
0.5 MHz, 1.0″ unfocused plane wave immersion transducer. For
continuous wave emission, the transducer was connected to a Teledyne-LeCroy
WaveStation 2012 wavefunction generator. The wavefunction generator
was operated in a continuous wave mode, swept over the frequency range
from 200 to 300 kHz with a sweep time of 300 s and resolution bandwidth
of 600 Hz. The range was selected to contain frequencies in the linear
portion of the first transmission band, that is, the homogenization
limit (Figure 2a).
For pulsing, the transducer was connected to an Imaginant DPR300 Pulser-Receiver
set at 0 dB gain. A Müller-Platte 0.5 mm needle probe, connected
to a Tektronix MDO3024b spectrum analyzer, was raster scanned over
a 70 × 32 mm area starting 25 mm from the edge of the tunable
lens in 5 mm increments along the propagation axis, and 2 mm increments
along the axis perpendicular to propagation.

Temperature was
controlled using an Omegalux resistive tape heater combined with a
thermocouple placed adjacent to the emitting transducer. The water
was heated at a rate of 0.3 °C per h with an equilibration time
of 10 min once a target temperature was reached. The sound field was
mapped at 20.5, 31.5, and 39.5 ± 0.5 °C for both a lens
with and without the hydrogel to determine the impact of the hydrogel
of focusing capabilities. 20.5, 31.5, and 39.5 °C serve to demonstrate
effects below, near, and above the LCST.
