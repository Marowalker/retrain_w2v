Biomimetic material
design is a useful method for producing new
functional materials. In recent years, catecholic polymers inspired
from the adhesion mechanism of marine organisms have attracted attention.
Here, we demonstrated the preparation of catecholic polymers by reversible
addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization
of an acetonide-protected catecholic monomer, that is, N-(2-(2,2-dimethylbenzo-1,3-dioxol-5-yl)ethyl)-acrylamide (DDEA).
By selecting the specific RAFT reagents, well-defined branched PDDEA
and linear PDDEA were obtained. These PDDEA samples showed stronger
adhesion strength after deprotection by acid stimulation compared
with that before deprotection. In addition, we demonstrated the adhesion
control of synthetic polymers by photoirradiation in the presence
of photoacid generators, which decompose under light and release an
acid.

Introduction
Nature produces a wide range of materials
with various functions,
and the creation of biomimetic materials that mimic these functions
attracts attention.1−5 Adhesion is a key property in the design of biomimetic materials,
and new materials are inspired from the adhesion mechanisms of various
organisms.6−10 In the adhesion mechanism of mussels, the catechol group plays an
important role,11,12 and various catechol-containing
polymers have been reported.13 A number
of catecholic polymers have been reported, including a main chain-type,
a side chain-type, and an end chain-type. Polydopamine, which is an
example of a main chain-type, is a mimetic polymer of the mussel’s
adhesive protein,14 and many studies have
progressed due to its ability to be coated on various substrates.15−18 We have also reported a design of a colorless polydopamine layer
and the modification of various material surfaces.19 Using polydopamine-based coating techniques, a variety
of functional materials were successfully prepared.20−22 However, adhesion
control is usually difficult because polydopamine is obtained by in
situ polymerization of dopamine on the surface of substrates.14 In contrast, catechol-functionalized synthetic
polymers, such as side chain-types23−28 and end chain-types,29,30 can be used as adhesives after
their synthesis. For example, the wet adhesion of polymers having
catechol groups in their side chains was dramatically increased compared
to that of noncatecholic polymers.23 It
has also been reported that polyethers prepared with catechol groups
at the end were useful as a surface modifier.29

The adhesion strength usually decreases when catechols are
oxidized
to produce quinone.31,32 Thus, catechol group-protected
polymers have been of interest due to their potential use in active
materials, because they can be used to control adhesive properties
by appropriate deprotection. Catechol derivatives having various protective
groups, including acetonide,27−29,33,34 acetyl,35,36 borate,37,38 silyl,39,40 carboxybenzyl,41 cyclic ethyl orthoformate,42 2-nitrobenzyl,43 and methyl ether groups,44 have been synthesized. Among them, acetonide-protecting
groups are useful for forming functional polymers because they can
be easily removed without affecting the polymer backbone under mild
acidic conditions.

The shape of the polymer is also important
for catecholic polymer
applications.45 While many catecholic polymers
have already been synthesized for use as surface modifiers or adhesives,
the majority of them are linear polymers with a low density of catechol
groups.45 Recently, compared to the conventional
linear catecholic polymers, the dendritic,46 hyperbranched,47 and multi-armed48 catecholic polymers have been reported to provide
superior properties related to surface modification, adhesion, and
antifouling efficacy. It is necessary to further accelerate this work
for engineering applications by controlling the shape and adhesion
ability of the catecholic polymers.

Here, we prepared branched
catecholic polymers by reversible addition–fragmentation
chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of an acetonide-protected monomer,
that is, N-(2-(2,2-dimethylbenzo-1,3-dioxol-5-yl)ethyl)-acrylamide
(DDEA). The main objective of this study is to examine the effect
of well-defined branched catecholic polymers on adhesion and achieve
adhesion control of the polymer by stimulation. By selecting the kind
of RAFT reagents, both branched PDDEA and linear PDDEA with controlled
chain lengths were obtained. The synthesized products are designated
as branched PDDEA54, branched PDDEA19, and linear
PDDEA25 (Figure 1). The adhesive strengths before and after deprotection with
acids of the three kinds of polymers were compared. In addition to
adhesion control by pH change, the use of photocontrollable materials
is important for practical applications such as local adhesion.49,50 With the knowledge we gained, photoinduced adhesion control using
catechol groups is attractive, but rarely studied. Takahara et al.
reported the usefulness of photoirradiation for adhesion control of
polymers, with the catechol protected by an ortho-nitrobenzyl group.43 It remains a challenge to develop an effective
strategy to create a photocontrollable system for adhesion of catecholic
polymers. Photoacid generators decompose by photoirradiation and release
an acid.51 We also demonstrated adhesion
control of designed polymers in the presence of photoacid generators.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Branched PDDEA
Figure 2 shows the synthetic
route of a designed
monomer and polymer. It is known that dopamine hydrochloride is polymerized
by self-oxidative polymerization under basic conditions.14 To prevent the self-oxidative reaction, N-(3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl) acrylamide (DPA) was synthesized
using dopamine hydrochloride and acryloyl chloride in the presence
of boronic compounds. In this reaction, sodium tetraborate decahydrate
(Na2B4O7·10H2O) was
added to protect the catechol groups with the borate ion, forming
a catechol–borate complex and preventing self-oxidative polymerization
under basic conditions.52 Additionally,
sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) dissolved in H2O was added during the reaction in order to maintain pH 9.
When the synthesized DPA compound was purified by silica gel chromatography,
the yield was very low. This phenomenon is probably due to the adsorption
of catechol groups to silica gel. Thus, the reaction proceeded without
purification to synthesize DDEA. The proton nuclear magnetic resonance
(1H NMR) spectrum of DDEA purified by column chromatography
is shown in Figure 3a. Protection of the catechol group by acetonide was confirmed by
the acetonide methyl group peak found in the DDEA measurement.

RAFT polymerization of DDEA was carried out using
1,1,1-tris[(dodecylthiocarbonothioylthio)-2-methylpropionate]ethane
(trisDCMP) having a three-branched structure as a RAFT reagent. Figure 3a,b shows the 1H NMR spectra of the DDEA monomer and the branched PDDEA after
purification by dialysis. Progress of the polymerization was confirmed
by the disappearance of the proton peak (a, b: δ = 5.6 and 6.2
ppm) of the DDEA monomer vinyl group. The conversion of RAFT polymerization,
calculated from the proton peak (g–i: δ = 6.3–6.6
ppm) of the benzene ring of unpurified PDDEA and the peak derived
from the DDEA monomer (a, b: δ = 6.2 ppm), was calculated to
be ca. 97%. The degree of polymerization (n) and
number average molecular weight (Mn,NMR) of the product, calculated by comparing the methyl group peak (a:
δ = 0.8–1.4 ppm) and the benzene ring proton peak (g–i:
δ = 6.3–6.6 ppm), were n = 54 and Mn,NMR = 14 500, respectively. Another
branched PDDEA was similarly obtained under the condition of [DDEA]/[trisDCMP]
= 25:1. The conversion, degree of polymerization, and Mn,NMR, calculated from NMR measurements, were 84%, 19,
and 5800, respectively. To investigate the effect of branching of
the polymer, linear PDDEA was also prepared by DPA polymerization
using 2-(dodecylthiocarbonothioylthio)-2-methylpropionic acid as a
RAFT reagent. Subsequent experiments were performed using three synthesized
polymers, that is, branched PDDEA54, branched PDDEA19, and linear PDDEA25 (Figure 1).

Figure 4 shows the
gel permeation chromatography (GPC) charts of branched PDDEA54, branched PDDEA19, and linear PDDEA25. The
GPC curve for the linear PDDEA is monomodal, whereas the curves for
the branched PDDEAs exhibited small peaks at low molecular weight
region besides main peaks. This phenomenon is probably due to insufficient
reaction. Because each polymer was formed from three initiating groups,
it was suggested that the polymer did not uniformly polymerize. The
conversion, molecular weight, and molecular weight distribution are
summarized in Table 1. The polydispersity Mw/Mn was calculated to be approximately 1.2–1.6. While
a small amount of low molecular weight compound was present, it was
shown that relatively monodisperse polymers were obtained. Two kinds
of branched PDDEA having different molecular weights with relatively
controlled molecular weight distributions were successfully synthesized.

Acetal-protecting
groups such as acetonide bridge-protecting groups
are capable of protecting two hydroxy groups at the same time. Acetal-protecting
groups are also resistant to basic conditions and high temperatures
and can be deprotected by an acid. Deprotection of acetonide using
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was carried out to investigate its influence
on adhesion properties before and after deprotection of catechol groups. Figure 5 shows the infrared
(IR) spectra of branched PDDEA54 before and after deprotection.
The IR spectrum after deprotection showed a broad absorption band
from 2500 to 3600 cm–1 as compared with that before
deprotection. This is believed to be a peak due to hydroxy groups
of the deprotected catechol group. Additionally, the strong absorption
peak at around 1000 cm–1 is due to ether on the
protected catechol moiety were decreased after deprotection of catechol
moiety. From the 1H NMR spectra of branched PDDEA54 before and after deprotection, the appearance of catechol groups
(l, m: δ = 8.5 and 8.8 ppm) and the disappearance of acetonide
(j: δ = 1.4 ppm) were confirmed (Figure 3c). In addition, the division of the aromatic
ring proton peaks (g–i: δ = 6.5 ppm) was observed, suggesting
the deprotection of acetonide groups.

Adhesive Strength Measurement
by Tensile Testing
The
adhesion properties of unprotected PDDEA (PDPA) prepared by acid treatment
just before use were investigated. The PDDEA or PDPA sample (5 mg)
was dissolved in 1 mL of methanol and then dropped on a glass substrate
at 60 °C to evaporate solvents. Another glass substrate was placed
on top of them. The sample was fixed by clamps and allowed to stand
for 24 h at room temperature to obtain a measurement sample. The sample
prepared was set on a tensile tester, and the shear adhesion strength
was measured (Figure 6a).

Figure 6 (a) Schematic illustration of the setup for measuring adhesion
strength. (b) Maximum value of adhesion strength of glass plates adhered
by PDDEA samples before and after deprotection of acetonide groups.
The polymer samples were sandwiched between two glass substrates,
and then the adhesive strength was measured. Because adhesive area
(m2) was slightly different for each sample, the adhesive
strengths were converted Pa (N m–2).

First, an adhesion test using linear PDDEA25 was conducted.
As shown in Figure 6b, the adhesive strength increased from 91.8 to 113.4 kPa after deprotection.
Next, the adhesion properties of branched PDDEA19, which
has a similar molecular weight as linear PDDEA25, were
examined. While the glass plate adhered by the branched PDDEA19 before deprotection was broken at 60.6 kPa, the maximum
tensile stress after deprotection increased to 82.2 kPa. We believe
that the adhesion of branched PDDEA19 was lower than that
of linear PDDEA25 because of the effect of the length of
the branch chain. Assuming that the lengths of branched polymers are
equal, the degree of polymerization of the side chain of branched
PDDEA19 is about 6. This caused lower adhesive ability.
On the other hand, the maximum tensile stress after deprotection of
branched PDDEA54 with a large molecular weight reached
186.1 kPa, showing stronger adhesion compared with branched PDDEA19. Additionally, the difference between the maximum tensile
stress values before and after deprotection was also large. In general,
the molecular weight of the polymer influences its properties, such
as the glass transition temperature, melting temperature, viscoelasticity,
and viscosity.53 The adhesion strength
increased with increasing molecular weight of PDDEA due to the entanglement
of polymer chains and the amount of catechol groups introduced at
adhesion sites. While the branched chain length of branched PDDEA54 was approximately 18, it showed higher adhesive strength
than linear PDDEA25. While the increase in adhesion strength
will be mainly due to the total increase in molecular weight, it seems
to be the multiple binding occurred due to the branched structure.
Compared with the adhesive strength before deprotection, all samples
showed stronger adhesion strength after deprotection, suggesting the
usability of deprotection of catechol groups. Although the adhesion
strength was effectively controlled by acid stimulation, it remains
unclear whether the effect of branched structures on adhesion. Detailed
study of branched polymers might be necessary. Further experiments
are in progress to control the branched structures and molecular weights
by changing the polymerization conditions. After adhesion measurements,
broken polymers remained on the failed area of each glass plate surface,
indicating that cohesive failure took place within the polymers.

Finally, control of the adhesive strength by the photoacid generator
was investigated. Diphenyl-2,4,6-trimethylphenylsulfonium p-toluenesulfonate, which produces p-toluenesulfonic
acid by photoirradiation, was used as an acid generator (Figure 7a). Branched PDDEA62 (100 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL acetone in the presence of
an acid generator (4.7 mg), sandwiched between two glass plates. After
irradiated with light (14 mW cm−2, 254 nm) for 30
min, samples were left to stand for 24 h. Figure 7b shows the adhesion strength of the samples.
The glass plates adhered by branched PDDEA62 without photoirradiation
broke at an adhesion strength of 141.0 kPa. In contrast, the adhesion
strength of branched PDDEA62 with photoirradiation increased
to 194.4 kPa, indicating that adhesion was improved by exposure of
catechol groups. Results show that the photo-activated adhesive process
was achieved with combined use of the acetonide-protecting group and
photoacid generators.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated the preparation
of well-defined
branched PDDEA and linear-PDDEA by RAFT polymerization of DDEA, which
is an acetonide-protected catecholic monomer. Both branched PDDEA
and linear PDDEA showed stronger adhesion after deprotection of acetonide
groups by acid stimulation compared with that before deprotection.
The adhesion strength increased with increasing PDDEA molecular weight,
and branched polymers showed higher adhesive strength than linear
polymers due to binding at multiple points of the branched structure.
Additionally, the adhesion of acetonide-protected catecholic polymers
was controlled by photoirradiation in the presence of photoacid generators.
Because adhesion control by light irradiation enables local adhesion,
our strategy, which includes control of the shape and adhesion ability
of the catecholic polymers, will be useful for practical applications.

GPC was conducted (Tosoh TSKgel α3000) with THF as the mobile
phase at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min at 40 °C. Polymethyl methacrylate
was used as a standard. Glass substrates were treated with oxygen
plasma (SEDE-GE, Meiwafosis). The adhesion strength was determined
by measuring the shear adhesion force with a tensile tester (Shimadzu
EZ-S) at 298 K in an ambient atmosphere. The crosshead speed was set
to 1 mm min–1 in tensile mode. The shear strength
was defined as the stress corresponding to the failure force divided
by an adhesion area.

(3.00 g, 15.8
mmol) was added to a stirred solution of Na2B4O7·10H2O (12.1 g, 31.6 mmol) and Na2CO3 (5.0 g, 47 mmol) in H2O (450 mL)
under an argon atmosphere. Acryloyl chloride was added to the resulting
mixture (5.1 mL, 63.2 mmol) in a dropwise manner at 0 °C; then,
the mixture was stirred at room temperature under an argon atmosphere.
After 12 h, Na2CO3 (5.0 g, 47 mmol) in H2O (50 mL) was added. The pH of the sample was adjusted to
approximately 1 with 4 M HCl aq and stirred under an open system.
After stirring for 1 h at room temperature, the reaction mixture was
washed with ethyl acetate and 0.1 M HCl aq. The solvent was removed

A solution of DPA (2.78 g, 13.4 mmol)
and p-TsOH·H2O (0.12 g, 0.65 mmol)
in toluene (150 mL) was refluxed for 2 h under argon atmosphere. 2,2-Dimethoxypropane
was added to the mixture (15.2 mL, 124 mmol) and stirred at 40 °C
for 2 h and then refluxed for 2 h. After removing the solvent by evaporation,
ethyl acetate was added and the mixture was washed with H2O. The organic layer was dried with Na2SO4 and
filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated with an evaporator. Column
chromatography was carried out using hexane/ethyl acetate = 1:1 as
a developing solvent. The solvent was removed to obtain a white solid

1.6 (s, 6H, (CH3)2–C−).

Synthesis
of Branched PDDEA by RAFT Polymerization
A typical RAFT polymerization
of DDEA, with a molar ratio of 75:1:1.5
([DDEA]/[trisDCMP]/[AIBN]), was performed as follows: DDEA (1.00 g,
4.04 mmol), trisDCMP (0.063 g, 0.054 mmol), AIBN (0.013 g, 0.081 mmol),
and DMF (2.0 mL) were placed in a round-bottom flask. The mixture
was deoxygenated by purging with argon for 15 min, with subsequent
placement in a water bath at 70 °C. After 6 h, the polymerization
was stopped by purging with oxygen at 0 °C. The reaction solution
was purified by dialysis using methanol/ethyl acetate at a 1:1 ratio.
The solvent was removed with an evaporator to obtain a pale yellow
solid.

Deprotection of Acetonide Groups by Addition of Acid
After adding 100 mg of PDDEA samples to a 1 mL sample bottle, 0.5
mL of TFA was added and stirred overnight.

Deprotection of Acetonide
Groups by Photoirradiation in the
Presence of Photoacid Generators
A solution of the branched
PDDEA (100 mg) and acetone (1 mL) in the presence of photoacid generator,
diphenyl-2,4,6-trimethylphenylsulfonium p-toluenesulfonate
(4.7 mg), was irradiated at 254 nm (14 mW cm−2)
for 30 min.

Measurement of Adhesive Strength by Tensile
Shear Strength Test
The PDDEA samples (5 mg: before or after
deprotection of acetonide
groups) was dissolved in 1 mL of methanol, and the solution was dropped
on an oxygen plasma-treated glass substrate and heated on a hot plate
at 60 °C. Another glass substrate was sandwiched between superimposed
clips from above and then allowed to stand and dry on a hot plate
at 60 °C. The adhesive strength was measured by the tensile test
with a speed of 1 mm min–1.
