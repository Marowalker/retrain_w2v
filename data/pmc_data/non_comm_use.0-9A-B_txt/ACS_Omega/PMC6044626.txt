Carbon
disulfide is an environmental toxin, but there are suggestions
in the literature that it may also have regulatory and/or therapeutic
roles in mammalian physiology. Thiols or thiolates would be likely
biological targets for an electrophile, such as CS2, and
in this context, the present study examines the dynamics of CS2 reactions with various thiols (RSH) in physiologically relevant
near-neutral aqueous media to form the respective trithiocarbonate
anions (TTC–, also known as “thioxanthate
anions”). The rates of TTC– formation are
markedly pH-dependent, indicating that the reactive form of RSH is
the conjugate base RS–. The rates of the reverse
reaction, that is, decay of TTC– anions to release
CS2, is pH-independent, with rates roughly antiparallel
to the basicities of the RS– conjugate base. These
observations indicate that the rate-limiting step of decay is simple
CS2 dissociation from RS–, and according
to microscopic reversibility, the transition state of TTC– formation would be simple addition of the RS– nucleophile
to the CS2 electrophile. At pH 7.4 and 37 °C, cysteine
and glutathione react with CS2 at a similar rate but the
trithiocarbonate product undergoes a slow cyclization to give 2-thiothiazolidine-4-carboxylic
acid. The potential biological relevance of these observations is
briefly discussed.

Introduction
This laboratory has
recently compiled literature information on
the known and suggested physiological properties of carbon disulfide
(CS2) and identified certain analogies to the small-molecule
bioregulators (SMBs) nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide
(sometimes called “gasotransmitters”).1 The common properties of these SMBs include partial solubility
in aqueous and lipid systems, the ability to diffuse readily in physiological
structures, and known toxicity at higher concentrations.2 Similarly, CS2 is a nonpolar, readily
diffusible molecule considered to be an environmental toxin.3 In addition, there are indications that CS2 is formed endogenously or in the associated gut microbiome
of mammals.4 Biological sulfhydryls (R–SH)
would be likely targets, and the dynamics of the “on”
and “off” reactions of this electrophile with such nucleophiles
should be crucial to any physiological roles. Thus, the present study
is focused on exploring the reactivity of CS2 with thiols,
such as cysteine (CysSH) and glutathione (GSH), as well as with several
model thiols to form trithiocarbonate anions (TTC–, also known as “thioxanthate anions”) in near-neutral
aqueous media (eq 1).
From the biomedical perspective, the trithiocarbonate anion (PhCH2SCS2–) has been studied as an
inhibitor to carbonic anhydrases and as a possible therapeutic in
glaucoma treatment.5 However, to our knowledge,
the dynamics of the formation and decay of TTC salts under physiologically
relevant conditions have not been previously reported. 1  

Elucidating prospective biological roles of carbon disulfide
will
depend on having vehicles for controlled CS2 release under
experimental biological conditions. Certain TTCs are unstable toward
the slow release of carbon disulfide,6 and
such reactivity may be relevant to the biological activity of CS2 as well as a desirable property for CS2 delivery.
In this context, we describe the kinetics of CS2 dissociation
from several prepared TTC– salts in aqueous solution.
The latter studies complement earlier investigations of CS2 generation by photosensitized oxidation of 1,1-dithiooxalate7 and by the thermal decay of dithiocarbamate anions.8 The CS2 release rates from the latter
precursors vary considerably, thereby providing a wide range of activities
for physiological experiments. The TTC derivatives of CysSH and GSH
also undergo a slow cyclization reaction to give 2-thiothiazolidine-4-carboxylic
acid (TTCA), a product that, when found in the urine, is considered
diagnostic of exposure to carbon disulfide.9,10 Notably,
this cyclization also releases an equivalent of hydrogen sulfide.

Results
and Discussion
Trithiocarbonate Decay
As noted
above, we have recently
described the kinetics for a set of dithiocarbamate salts that decay
by releasing CS2 with lifetimes ranging from seconds to
days in near-neutral, aerobic aqueous media at 37 °C.8 In this section, we describe analogous decays
of several RSCS2– anions under similar
conditions.

The TTC– salts used here were
prepared by the reaction of the corresponding thiol precursor with
CS2 in strongly alkaline solution. The electronic spectrum
of each displays intense absorption bands at approximately 310 and
330–350 nm with extinction coefficient of ∼8 ×
103 M–1 s–1 (e.g., Figure 1) that we assign
to π → π* transitions largely localized on the
−SCS2– functional group. Time-dependent
density functional theory calculations (Supporting Information (SI) Figure S1) support this assignment. Similar but
somewhat higher-energy absorptions are seen in the spectra of analogous
dithiocarbamate (R2NCS2–)
and xanthate (ROCS2–) anions.8,11

Figure 1 Temporal
solution spectra at 49 s intervals tracking the decay
of Na2[PTTC] (initially about 0.11 mM) in pH 7.4, 37 °C
aqueous solution (phosphate buffer at 100 mM). The increasing absorbance
at 206 nm is consistent with the strong absorbance of CS2 at this wavelength.

Decays of the TTC anions in aqueous media are readily followed
by the temporal decreases of these two UV bands (Figure 1). These spectral changes were
accompanied by the release of at least 90% of the CS2 predicted,
for example, by the stoichiometry of eq 2, using the CS2 analysis method described
in detail elsewhere7,8 and briefly in the Experimental Section. 2  

As discussed below,
the decays of these TTC– anions
are reversible; therefore, it is necessary to take the back-reaction
into account as indicated in eq 3 when evaluating the kinetics of the temporal spectral changes.
These reactions were conducted in buffered solutions at specific pH
values, and the effects of pH, buffer, and other factors are incorporated
into the apparent rate constants koff and kon for the forward reaction and back-reaction.
Although [CS2] is not constant during an individual experiment,
the temporal spectral data can be fit numerically using a nonlinear
least-squares regression program (see Experimental
Section and SI Figure S2); however,
the kon values so obtained are inherently
less accurate than are the corresponding koff values. 3  Figure 1 illustrates temporal
spectral changes observed when a sample
of the sodium salt of 3-trithiocarbonatopropionate (Na2[PTTC]) undergoes decay in pH 7.4 aqueous solution at 37 °C
(eq 2). Table 1 summarizes the rate constants koff and kon calculated
as described. There was no significant effect of pH on koff over the range 6.5–7.8; thus, the decay of
PTTC– is not catalyzed by acid, an observation that
is in direct contrast to the decay under analogous conditions of the
dithiocarbamate ions. The kon values for
the reverse reaction appear to increase with pH, as would be expected,
if this step involves the reaction of the electrophile CS2 with the thiolate group of the product. This type of reactivity
is discussed in greater detail below. No significant effects were
seen for increasing ionic strength from 0.154 to 0.308 M or buffer
concentration from 50 to 100 mM.

A linear Eyring plot of the koff values
determined for the decay of PTTC– in pH 7.4 aqueous
buffer solution over the temperature range of 5–55 °C
(SI Figure S3) gave the activation parameter
values ΔH‡ = 70.3 ±
0.7 kJ mol–1 and ΔS‡ = −69 ± 2 J K–1 mol–1.

MPTTC–, the methyl ester of PTTC–, shows similar behavior (eq 4, SI Figure S4). At 37 °C,
the rate constant for decay was (2.40 ± 0.01) × 10–3 s–1. Kinetics data collected at 27.1, 37.0, and
46.4 °C at pH 7.4 gave the activation parameters ΔH⧧ = 75.7 ± 0.1 kJ mol–1 and ΔS⧧ = −51.4
± 0.4 J K–1 mol–1. 4  

N-Acetylcysteine trithiocarbonato anion (NacTTC–, eq 5) behaved similarly but gave larger values for both koff (0.0118 ± 0.004 s–1) and kon (0.7 ± 0.2 M–1 s–1) in pH 7.4 aqueous phosphate buffer solution (100
mM) at 37 °C. An Eyring plot of koff values measured over the temperature range of 5–55 °C
(SI Figure S3) gave the activation parameter
values ΔH‡ = 66.8 ±
0.9 kJ mol–1 and ΔS‡ = −67 ± 3 J K–1 mol–1 quite similar to those determined for the decay of PTTC–. 5  

Analogous kinetics studies for decay
of the benzyl trithiocarbonate
anion (BnTTC–, eq 6) displayed decreases in the 302 and 332 nm absorption
band characteristic of such TTC– anions (SI Figure S5). The reactions are somewhat faster
than seen for PTTC–, but again the rate constants koff for the forward reaction showed essentially
no sensitivity to the solution pH over the range of 6.5–10.1
(Table 2). In contrast,
the kon value calculated was markedly
larger at the highest pH, and this was reflected by the reaction not
going to completion but reaching an equilibrium or steady state (Figure 2). 6  

The absence of a pH effect on the koff values in 37 °C aqueous media for the decays of PTTC– and BnTTC– is consistent with the rate-limiting
step dissociation of CS2 from the conjugate thiolate anion,
RS–, followed by protonation of the latter, as illustrated
in Scheme 1. In accord
with this sequence where the first step is rate limiting, that is koff = k1, the reactivity
order NacTTC– > BnTTC– >
PTTC– ∼ MPTTC at pH 7.4 is roughly antiparallel
to
the increasing basicity of the thiolate anion RS– as reflected in pKa values of the respective
thiols (RSH) (SI Table S1).12−16

In
other words, the more basic thiolate ions are slower to dissociate
from the CS2 electrophile. However, one might expect a
positive value of ΔS‡ for
unimolecular dissociation of the RS–CS2 bond illustrated
in the first step of Scheme 1, but that was not the case for PTTC–, MPTTC–, or NacTTC–. One possible explanation
for the observed negative ΔS‡ values would be a pathway involving concerted protonation of the
exiting thiolate group by a general acid (solvent or buffer conjugate
acid). However, no general acid catalysis was observed and protonation
by H2O itself would generate hydroxide ion, which would
be unfavorable. Thus, a more likely explanation for a negative entropy
of activation draws from solvent reorganization as the negative charge
delocalized over the −CS2– functional
group becomes localized on the thiolate ion at the transition state
(Scheme 2).

Reorganization upon CS2 Dissociation from a
TTC– Anion
Formation of Trithiocarbonates
Physiologically, thiols
are likely targets in the action of CS2 either as a toxin
or in potential bioregulatory or therapeutic roles.1 For example, modification of a key protein thiol by the
formation of trithiocarbonate would be expected to have profound effects
on that protein’s activity. The “on” reaction
noted above is, of course, the formation of the TTC– adduct from the parent thiol plus CS2. The goal in this
section is to examine the dynamics of trithiocarbonate formation with
cysteine and several cysteine derivatives, including glutathione,
in greater detail.

Figure 3 illustrates the temporal spectrum changes that occur
rapidly after stopped-flow mixing of a solution containing excess
cysteine [CysSH] with a second solution containing CS2 in
pH 7.4 aqueous buffer at 37 °C. Very similar spectral changes
were shown to result from the reactions of CS2 with (respectively) N-acetylcysteine (NacSH), glutathione (GSH, SI Figure S6), and cysteine methyl ester (MecSH,
SI Figure S7). In each case, the appearance
of the spectrum characteristic of a TTC– anion (eq 7) followed an exponential
rise as seen in the figure inset. 7  

Figure 4 illustrates
the absorption changes at 332 nm characteristic of formation of CysTTC– (eq 7) when a pH 7.4 buffered solution of excess CysSH was mixed with
a solution containing CS2 in the stopped-flow spectrometer.
Under such “pseudo-first-order” conditions where [CysSH]
≫ [CS2], the temporal absorption changes can be
fit to a simple exponential function from which the observed first-order
rate constant kobs was obtained. Under
these conditions where the system is relaxing to equilibrium and CS2 is the limiting reactant, the relationship described by eq 8 holds true.17 8  Thus, when RSH = CysSH,
a plot of kobs versus [CysSH] should be
linear with a slope
equal to kon and an intercept equal to koff. The inset of Figure 4 is such a plot for the reaction of CS2 with excess CysSH in 37 °C, pH 7.4 buffered aqueous
solutions from which the values kon =
2.9 ± 0.1 M–1 s–1 and koff = 0.103 ± 0.002 s–1 were determined. Plots similar to Figure 4 were generated for the reactions of glutathione
(GSH), cysteine methyl ester (MecSH), and N-acetylcysteine
(NacSH) (SI Figures S6–S8), and
the kon and koff values so determined are summarized in Table 3. Notably, the values of kon and koff determined in
37 °C, pH 7.4 solution for NacSH (0.606 ± 0.008 M–1 s–1 and 0.0138 ± 0.001 s–1, respectively) can be compared to those (0.7 ± 0.2 M–1 s–1 and 0.018 ± 0.004 s–1) obtained above by following the decay of NacTTC– under similar conditions. Given the different procedures and apparatus
used in these two experiments, the agreement is quite good.

As noted above for several other TTC anions, the koff values reported in Table 3 for the cysteine derivatives decrease as
the basicity of the RS– increases owing presumably
to the higher RS–CS2– bond strength
through this series. The values of kon at pH 7.4 show a similar decrease (hence, the ratio kon/koff varies only modestly
over this series). The behavior of kon would be consistent with the mechanism suggested by the microscopic
reverse of Scheme 1. If koff = k1, then kon = k2 f(H+), where f(H+) = Ka/(Ka + [H+]). As the acidity of RSH (Ka) increases, more of the conjugate base thiolate RS– is available at pH 7.4. Thus, one would expect kon to increase. However, the nucleophilicity
of RS– is likewise also decreasing over this series,
so one might expect the rate constant k2 for the nucleophilic attack of RS– on CS2 to correspondingly decrease in going from NacS– to MeCysS–, the two trends therefore countering
each other. This may help account for a reactivity difference on only
an order of magnitude between NacSH and MeCysSH at pH 7.4 despite
the much greater difference in Ka values.

SI Figure S9 displays Eyring plots of
the kon and koff values determined in a similar manner for the reaction of CysSH
with CS2 in pH 7.4 buffered aqueous solution over the temperature
range of 25–45 °C. The apparent activation parameters
for kon are ΔH⧧ = +84.3 kJ mol–1 and ΔS⧧ = +37.4 J K–1 mol–1, and those for koff are
ΔHoff⧧ = +75.1
kJ mol–1 and ΔSoff⧧ = −21.7 J K–1 mol–1. Notably, ΔH⧧ for koff in this case are quite similar
to that recorded above at pH 7.4 for the decays of PTTC–, MPTTC–, and NacTTC–, but because
ΔS⧧ remains negative in this
case, it is less so than for the other three (SI Table S2). According to the proposed mechanism described in Scheme 1, koff = k1, so the apparent
ΔH⧧ and ΔS⧧ for this step equal ΔH1⧧ and ΔS1⧧, respectively. The relationship is more
complex for kon because it equals k2 f(H+).
If one were to make the rough approximation that, at pH 7.4, [H+] ≫ Ka, then kon ≅ k2Ka[H+]−1 and then ΔHon⧧ ≅ ΔH2⧧ + ΔHa0 and ΔSon⧧ ≅ ΔS2⧧ + ΔSa0. The values of ΔHa0 and ΔSa0 can be calculated
as +30.9 kJ/mol and −52 J K–1 mol–1, respectively, from the pH dependence of the pKa of cysteine (SI Figure S10).19 Thus, on the basis of this model,
ΔH2⧧ ≅
53 kJ mol–1 and ΔS2⧧ ≅ +89 J K–1 mol–1 for the reaction of CysSH with CS2.

Table 4 reports
the results of analogous stopped-flow kinetics studies of the reactions
of CysSH and GSH with CS2 to form CysTTC– and GTTC– (eqs 7 and 9, respectively) at different
pH values over the range of 7.4–9.6. The kobs values were determined for a range of different initial
CysSH concentrations at each pH, and linear plots of kobs versus [CysSH] similar to those shown in Figure 4 and SI Figures S6–S8 gave the pH-dependent values
of kon and koff. Both systems show dramatic increases in kon at higher pH as anticipated from the simple mechanism proposed
in Scheme 1. Consistent
with the experiments for PTTC– and BnTTC– reported in Tables 1 and 2, the koff values for GTTC– are pH-independent; however,
this was not the case for CysTTC–, for which koff decreases by about a factor of four from
pH 7.4 to 9.6. We attribute this difference to the relative proximity
of the protonated amine group (NH3+) to the
trithiocarbonate functionality in CysTTC–. The resulting
change in the inductive effect upon deprotonation of this group at
higher pH should enhance the basicity of the thiolate, thus leading
to slower dissociation of CS2. Although GTTC– has a similar amine, it is positioned further from the TTC functionality
and its deprotonation would have a much smaller impact. 9

Subsequent Reactions of
CysTTC– and GTTC–
Although
the reaction of CS2 with
cysteine initially showed the rapid appearance of new absorption bands
at ∼295 and 332 nm consistent with the formation of the trithiocarbonate
CysTTC– (eq 7), a much slower subsequent reaction was evidenced by further
spectral changes (Figure 5) involving the disappearance of the bands at ∼295
and 332 nm and the appearance of a new band at 270 nm. The latter
band can be assigned to the cyclized compound thiazolidine-2-thione-carboxylate
(TTCA, eq 10),9 which has been identified20,21 as a urinary excretion product from humans who have been exposed
to CS2. The temporal decay at 332 nm and rise at 270 nm
could be fit to exponential functions to give the respective first-order
rate constants 5.2 × 10–5 and 4.9 × 10–5 s–1 in pH 7.4 aq phosphate buffer
at 37 °C (SI Figure S11). However,
inspection of the spectral changes shows the absence of isosbestic
points, as well as an absorbance increase followed by a decrease of
a shoulder at ∼230 nm, which are clear indications that a transient
intermediate species is formed. When the reaction was run with a very
large excess of CysSH ([CS2] = 0.2 mM; [CysSH] = 10 mM),
the kobs value measured was nearly the
same (5.8 × 10–5 s–1). Thus,
it appears that this slow cyclization process is unimolecular and
does not involve the reaction of free CysSH. 10  

The reaction of cysteine (10 mM) and
CS2 (10 mM) was further studied in a buffered phosphate
deuterium oxide solution (prepared with anhydrous Na3PO4 plus D2O, pD 7.5) to characterize more thoroughly
the formation of TTCA. DCl solution (35 wt % in D2O) was
used to correct the pD. The reaction was run for 24 h at 37 °C.
A small aliquot of the product solution was used to check the electronic
spectrum, which showed the presence of a single and intense absorption
band at 271 nm (SI Figure S12), indicating
the formation of the cyclic compound because unreacted cysteine and
oxidized cysteine products, such as cystine, have no strong absorption
bands in this wavelength range. The 1H NMR spectrum of
the product solution (SI Figure S13) showed
not only resonances belonging to unreacted cysteine but also two groups
of proton resonances at 3.67–3.63 ppm (S–CH2, doublet of doublets) and 3.92–3.89 (CH, broad doublet of
doublets) attributed by van Doorn et al. to the hydrogens of TTCA.22

Figure 5 Spectral changes upon mixing CS2 (1 mM) with
CysSH (1
mM) in pH 7.4 aq phosphate buffer (100 mM) at 37 °C in a sealed
cell indicating the slow transformation of CysTTC– (red spectrum) to TTCA (blue spectrum). Total time = 17 h. Spectra
recorded at 600 s intervals.

GTTC– formed by the relatively rapid reaction
of GSH with CS2 also goes through a very slow transformation
to a new species reported to be TTCA (SI Figure S14). However, similar spectral changes/secondary reaction
was not seen with 3-trithiocarbonatopropionate (PTTC–) but was observed with 3-trithiocarbonatopropylamine and thus an
amine functionality appears to be required. This is not simply the
transfer of CS2 from the thiolate to the amine to form
a dithiocarbamate (DTC–) analogue because the spectrum
formed by the reaction of aqueous base and glycine displays bands
at 253 and 284 nm (data not shown) typical of DTC anions and very
different from the characteristic of TTCA. The mechanism(s) of these
transformations are the subject of continuing investigation.

Summary
We have described the kinetics of the formation and decay of trithiocarbonate
derivatives formed by the reactions of carbon disulfide and various
thiols (RSH) under physiologically relevant conditions (near-neutral
pH, 37 °C). Rates of TTC– formation are strongly
dependent on solution pH, indicating that the rate-limiting step involves
the reaction of the thiolate anion RS– with the electrophilic
CS2 substrate. Rates of TTC– decay are
pH-independent, consistent with microscopic reversibility. The relative
decay rates have a reverse correlation to the basicity of the RS– anions as expected if simple dissociation of CS2 is rate determining, as illustrated by the qualitative reaction
coordinate diagram shown in Figure 6. At pH 7.4, glutathione and cysteine react with CS2 at similar rates, and in both cases, the resulting TTC– anions undergo slow cyclization reactions to a cyclized
species identified previously as 2-thiothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid.
As noted above, the latter has been found to be urinary excretion
products from individuals exposed to toxic levels of carbon disulfide.
Similar reactions with protein thiols could lead to irreversible modifications
of such targets as well as releasing an equivalent of H2S.

Figure 6 Qualitative reaction coordinate diagram for the formation (kon) and decay (koff) of trithiocarbonate anions (RSCS2–) from the respective thiols plus carbon disulfide. According to Scheme 1, TTC– decay is independent of pH (koff = k1), whereas the forward reaction is strongly
pH-dependent owing to the RSH ⇌ RS– + H+ equilibrium.

The present data do not resolve the question whether CS2 might serve some type of bioregulatory role. Although thiols
would
appear to be logical targets for this electrophile, it is clear that
the rates and equilibrium constants for TTC– adduct
formation are many orders of magnitude smaller than those for reactions
of NO with heme proteins, the best characterized targets of that SMB.23,24 It appears likely that any such bioregulatory relevant sites for
CS2 would have higher binding constants, for example, an
activated thiolate protein, where the TTC– anion
is stabilized by other intramolecular interactions. Another could
be a metal center because it is well established that transition-metal
ions activate CS2 toward reaction with coordinated nucleophiles
and insertion into metal–ligand bonds, owing to the strong
bonding of the 1,1-dithiolate (−CS2–) functionality as a ligand. Such reactivity has been reported for
metal–sulfur bonds25,26 as well as with alkoxide,27 amine,28,29 and (even) phosphine30 ligands. Given the relatively high cytosolic
concentrations of GSH31 and plasma-based
protein sulfhydryls,32 the reversible formation
of unstabilized TTCs may play a role in CS2 transport.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Except where otherwise noted, all materials
were of analytical or reagent grade and were used without further
purification. N-Acetyl-l-cysteine (≥99%,
TLC), 3-mercaptopropionic acid (≥99%), l-cysteine
(97%), glycine (≥98.5%), and reduced l-glutathione
(98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Carbon disulfide (ACS Reagent
Grade, ≥99.9%), benzyl mercaptan (Alfa Aesar, 99%), potassium
hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, and mono- and dibasic sodium phosphate
and sodium chloride used to prepare buffers were purchased from Fisher
Scientific.

Synthesis of TTCs
Sodium 3-(Trithiocarbonato)propionate
(Na2[PTTC])
This species had been generated as
an intermediate in the preparation
of a corresponding trithiocarbonate ester.33 A round-bottom flask was charged with pentane and CS2 (30 mL each) plus a stir bar and then was cooled to approximately
0–5 °C with an ice bath and purged with inert gas. During
rapid stirring, finely ground NaOH (3.09 g, 77.4 mmol) was added to
the flask under inert gas. Sufficient water was added to solubilize
the hydroxide (1–3 mL), and to the resulting base solution,
3-mercaptopropionic acid (4.11 g, 38.7 mmol) in diethyl ether (10
mL) was added dropwise over the course of a few minutes. A deep yellow
powder immediately began to precipitate. The reaction was allowed
to warm to room temperature, and stirring was continued for 6–12
h. The solid was collected via filtration and rinsed with cold Et2O. The yield was 3.68 g (37%). The product proved to be soluble
only in methanol or water; however, attempts to recrystallize from
these solvents resulted in decomposition. The optical spectrum of
the initial product in pH 7.4 water displayed bands at λmax = 303 and 332 nm with an extinction coefficient at 332
nm (8650 M–1 cm–1) close to those
previously observed for alkyl TTCs.21 The
infrared spectrum and CHN analysis are consistent with a hydrated
sample. The solid is rather odorous. The compounds were kept in a
freezer for long-term storage. Infrared spectrum: (attenuated total
reflection in cm–1) selected bands 989, 879 (ν,
C–S), 1148 (C=S), 1395 (δ, C–O), 1555 (ν,
C–O), 1655 (δ, O–H), 3300 (ν, O–H).
Anal.: (calculated values for C4H4Na2S3·2H2O in parentheses): C, 18.1 (18.32);
H, 2.8 (3.07).

Triethylammonium (N-Acetylcysteine)trithiocarbonate
([HNEt3][NacTTC])
To an ice-cold (0–5 °C)
flask containing diethyl ether (30 mL) and triethylamine (3.72 g,
36.8 mmol) under inert atmosphere, a 3 g portion of N-acetylcysteine (18.4 mmol) was added. Dimethylformamide (2–3
drops) was added to solubilize the N-acetylcysteine,
after which CS2 (1.90 g, 25 mM) was added dropwise, resulting
in rapid separation of an insoluble, viscous, translucent, golden
oil. This oil was separated from the solvent by decanting and was
dried in vacuo for several days at elevated temperature (∼40
°C). The oil was then dissolved in ethanol, heated gently, and
the resulting solution stirred vigorously. Vacuum removal of the ethanol
resulted again in a golden oil. This product was stored in a freezer.
Optical spectrum: λmax = 302 and 333 nm in pH 7.0
water with a molar extinction coefficient of ∼8400 M–1 cm–1 at the latter wavelength. ESI-MS (neg. mode)
(75% ACN, 25% H2O): Anion predicted (+H+), 237.96 m/z; found, 237.94 m/z, 259.89 m/z (+Na+), 339.04 m/z (+TEAH+). Also observed, 162.17 m/z (N-acetylcysteine, impurity/decomposition). Anal.
(calculated values for C18H39N3O3S3 in parentheses): C, 48.0 (48.95); H, 8.22 (8.90);
N, 9.39 (9.51).

Potassium Benzyl Trithiocarbonate (K[BnTTC])
The preparation
was adapted from a known procedure.5 A
round-bottom flask was charged with a magnetic stirring bar, diethyl
ether (30 mL), and carbon disulfide (10 mL). The solution was cooled
to 0–5 °C with an ice bath and then purged with nitrogen.
Finely ground KOH (2.00 g, 35.6 mmol) was added and then benzyl mercaptan
(5 mL, 5.29 g, 42.6 mmol) was added to this cloudy mixture over a
period of 2 min. The resulting solution rapidly became yellow and
cloudy to give a chalky precipitate. This mixture was stirred for
an additional 3 h. The solid product was collected by filtration and
washed with diethyl ether and cold ethanol (4 × 10 mL). The solid
was then added to a flask containing 150 mL of Et2O and
collected by filtration again to remove excess dimethylformamide.
Recrystallization from a 50/50 mixture of ethanol and acetonitrile
gave a deep yellow, mildly odorous powder that was dried in vacuo
and stored in a freezer. The yield was 4.58 g (54%). K[BnTTC] decomposes when dissolved in water or water/alcohol mixtures
to give highly odorous product(s). CHN anal. (calculated values for
C8H7KS3 in parentheses): C, 39.8
(40.3); H, 2.84 (2.96). Optical spectrum: λmax =
302 and 332 nm in pH 7.4 water (extinction coefficient of ∼9300
M–1 cm–1 at the latter wavelength).
(Note: Benzyl mercaptan has a particularly unpleasant odor
and is toxic. Proper environmental controls must be observed when
handling this liquid.)

Kinetics Methods
Phosphate buffers were prepared using
mono- and dibasic sodium phosphate and sodium chloride (to maintain
ionic strength). Nanopure water (≥18 megohm) was obtained from
a Barnstead Nanopure II system and used in solution preparations.

The rates of the TTC decompositions were determined by monitoring
temporal spectral changes on a Shimadzu UV-2401 spectrophotometer
with UVProbe kinetics software. The reaction cell was a septum-capped,
sealable quartz cuvette with a 1.0 cm path length and an approximate
volume of 4.80 mL. The cells were thermostated (±0.2 °C)
at the desired reaction temperature, and the solutions were stirred
with a Starna “Spinnette” stirrer. Septum-sealed cells
containing the buffer solution of interest temperature equilibrated
(7–10 min) under the desired conditions (typically 37 °C).
A small amount of the solid TTC salt (5–10 mg) was then added
to a vial containing 3–5 mL of buffer to prepare a stock solution.
A 100 μL aliquot of this stock solution was then syringed into
the thermostated cuvette. The volumes were chosen to minimize the
headspace in the cuvette. Data acquisition was initiated after an
estimated dead time of 60–90 s.

Kinetics of the reactions
of CS2 with various thiols
to examine the rates of TTC formation were generally performed using
an Applied Photophysics SX.19MV stopped-flow UV–visible spectrophotometer
with photodiode array (temporal spectra) or a photomultiplier tube
(single wavelength) detector. Aqueous buffered solutions of the thiol
(RSH) and CS2 were loaded into Hamilton salt syringes (#1725
AD-SL), which were attached to the mixing block of the spectrophotometer
and sealed from the outside atmosphere by a three-way valve. These
syringes were maintained at the desired temperature (generally 37
°C unless otherwise noted) by a circulating water bath. The connector
tubing and observation cell were purged with the sample solution by
filling and emptying the drive syringes 3× prior to data acquisition.
Stopped-flow mixing of the two solutions initiated the reaction. The
entire unit was controlled with “Applied Photophysics Pro-Data
SX” software. Only simultaneous symmetric mixing was used (1:1
dilution).

Kinetics data were processed using Igor Pro 6.37
software by WaveMetrics,
Inc., and Prism 7 by GraphPad Software, Inc. For global fittings of
equilibrium analyses and determination of back-reaction values, a
DynaFit (BioKin Ltd) nonlinear least-squares regression program was
used.

Computational Studies
All density functional theory
(DFT) computations were performed using Gaussian’09 software
packages. Optimizations were performed using Kohn–Sham DFT
with the hybrid M06-2X exchange-correlation functional and the 6-311+G(d,p)
basis set. No symmetry restriction was imposed, and implicit solvent
effects were included using PCM (solvent = water) methods, as implemented
in Gaussian 09. Vibrational frequency calculations were performed
at the same level of theory to verify that no imaginary frequencies
were present and to ensure the true local minima energies. Single-point
energy and time-dependent DFT calculations were performed using the
M062X/6-311+G(3df,3pd) level of theory.

Analysis of CS2 Release
This procedure was
similar to that described by Schwach and Nyanzi34 and to that used in this laboratory to detect CS2 released by the photolysis of CdSe quantum dots surface decorated
with 1,1-dithiooxalate7 and for the CS2 released in the thermal reactions of dithiocarbamate salts.8

Notes
Carbon disulfide is toxic at high exposures,
and long periods of modest exposure have been associated with a number
of health conditions. CS2 and CS2-generating
compounds should be handled and stored with care.

The SH group pKs’s of N-acetylcysteine (NacSH) and 3-mercaptoproprionic
acid (3-MPA)
are 9.5 and 10.3, respectively (refs (13) and (14)). Benzyl mercaptan is not water soluble, but a value of
9.46 has been reported (ref (15)) although since mercaptans are typically ∼5.5 pKa units more acidic than the corresponding alcohols
and benzyl alcohol has a pKa of 15.4 (ref (16)), we would have estimated
a slightly higher pKa of ∼9.9.
