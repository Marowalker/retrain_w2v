Zinkicide is a systemic bactericidal
formulation containing protein-size
fluorescent zinc oxide-based nanoparticles (nano-ZnO). Previous studies
have shown that Zinkicide is effective in controlling citrus diseases.
Its field performance as an antimicrobial agent has been linked to
the bioavailability of zinc ions (Zn2+) at the target site.
It is therefore important to monitor Zn2+ release from
Zinkicide so that application rates and frequency can be estimated.
In this study, we present a simplistic approach designed to monitor
Zinkicide nanoparticle dissolution rates in water and acidic buffer
solutions using traditional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The evolution of nano-ZnO in the polyacrylamide
gel scaffolds was studied by exciting the sample with UV light and
detecting the fluorescence of nano-ZnO. Fluorescence intensities measured
with this assay allowed for quantitative analysis of molecular weight
changes of nano-ZnO in citrate buffer, a surrogate of citrus juice.
Our results demonstrated that citrate buffer induced the greatest
degradation of Zinkicide. Fluorescence intensity fluctuations were
observed over time, indicating interactions of citrate with the surface
of nano-ZnO. These findings provide a new approach to quantify the
dissolution of nanoparticles in simulated environments, even when
other analytical methods lack sensitivity because of the small size
of the system (≈4 nm).

1 Introduction
Engineered
nanomaterials have greatly improved a plethora of applications
including the manufacturing of biomedical, industrial, and consumer
products.1−3 Specifically, nanoparticles (NPs) have gained traction
in the agriculture sector because of their unique physicochemical
and multifunctional potential,2 which provides
new avenues to induce higher efficacy rates for crop protection and
crop yields.4,5 Zinc oxide NPs (nano-ZnO) in particular
are beneficial for a variety of agriculture practices such as pest
management, fertilizer treatment, and drug delivery.5−8 Several groups have reported on the development of ZnO materials
as an alternative management tactic for conventional copper (Cu)-based
bactericidal spray applications.8,9 Among them, Zinkicide,
a nano-ZnO-based bactericide, has demonstrated outstanding antimicrobial
activity against citrus canker, citrus melanose, and citrus scab.8 Ultrasmall ZnO NPs (<10 nm) exhibit special
traits for sustainable crop treatment because of their small packaging,
providing the ability to penetrate the vascular system of the plant.10 These site-targeted treatments are important
for antagonizing bacteria inside the crop which is where a variety
of systemic diseases take homage.9−11 Furthermore, ZnO NPs
exhibit bespoke multifunctional characteristics such as antimicrobial,
bactericidal, and micronutrient efficacies.5

A problematic crop disease is Huanglongbing, also known as
citrus
greening, which is a systemic citrus disease.8 This disease is bacterial-borne and has decimated the citrus industry
worldwide. The current status of the citrus industry urges the development
of treatments such as ZnO NPs to suppress pathogen progression.8 An agriculture-grade variation of Zinkicide has
been developed in view of offering growers with an effective systemic
bactericide engineered for the treatment of citrus greening. Zinkicide
contains ultrasmall (4.0 nm average size) spherical ZnO NPs highly
dispersible in solution. By design, nano-ZnO is expected to be fully
degraded in planta and produce micronutrient Zn2+ ions
via dissolution kinetics.4,12−17 However, evaluating the changes in particle size of nano-ZnO in
aqueous solution and quantifying the change of NP characteristics
over time are challenging given the small size of the NPs (D < 4.0 nm).

Because of the physical and chemical
properties of commercial-grade
Zinkicide, a variety of conventional characterization tools have failed
to provide reliable size measurements. Dynamic light scattering (DLS)18−21 is the most commonly used technique for the characterization of
NPs in aqueous solution. DLS is predominantly used for classifying
NP size and size distributions. However, the ultrasmall size of this
material falls under the limit of detection of DLS (<10 nm). Ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) absorption spectroscopy22,23 is considered
a valuable technique for NP-derived materials; however, in the case
of Zinkicide, absorption interferences from other chemicals present
in the stock hinder the analysis of NP traits. Inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)24,25 has been used
for metal NP characterization quite extensively but was deemed unreliable
for Zinkicide particle size characterization in the separate investigations.
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is a reliable
tool to measure electron-dense metals and metal oxide particles in
the vacuum state. A HRTEM study has revealed the size of the Zinkicide
particles. A synchrotron X-ray absorption/fluorescence-based technique
is suitable for detecting metal NPs in plant tissue and has been successfully
used to detect Zinkicide residues in planta.26 However, this technique has several limitations including detection
reliability for the 4.0 nm sized ZnO particles. Because of increased
dissolution rates of ultrasmall ZnO NPs in solution, the use of synchrotron
X-ray absorption/fluorescence measurements is not suitable for NPs
dispersed in solution. Lastly, small-angle neuron scattering (SANS)
was found to be suitable to measure the particle size in aqueous suspension
but requires extensive preparation and suffers from limited access
to the sophisticated characterization machinery.27 However, this technique is time-consuming and determining
the size of the NPs is arduous in materials prepared with highly saturated
solutions. Because of the high concentration needed for SANS characterization,
mimicking the application rate for in-field concentration conditions
and analyzing dissolution of the particles will be challenging. On
the other hand, the determination of NP sizes using gel electrophoresis28−30 has been minimally investigated. Traditionally, agarose gel electrophoresis
has been used for separation and purification of NPs, yet measurements
similar to protein studies have rarely been conducted. Krizkova et
al. reported that they qualitatively measured NP sizes using agarose
gel electrophoresis and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).28 They used
SDS-PAGE to separate different sized NPs using similar processes such
as traditional NP purification with gel electrophoresis tools.28

In this study, we have developed a new
protocol using SDS-PAGE
combined with fluorescence imaging for the detection and quantification
of Zinkicide dissolution in aqueous solutions. The protocol was developed
on the premise that Zinkicide particle sizes are comparable to protein
dimensions and that they exhibit fluorescent properties when exposed
to UV light, which is compatible with conventional gel imaging stations.
Taking advantage of the inherent emission property of Zinkicide, the
fluorescence intensity of Zinkicide dispersed in aqueous solution
was monitored over time. Quantitative analysis of Zinkicide in polyacrylamide
gels allowed for tracking its relative molecular weight changes in
water and citric acid buffer over time. The present study provides
a useful tool for detecting and monitoring the dissolution of ZnO
bactericidal NPs in aqueous solutions.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Zinkicide Detection and
Concentration Measurements
Figure S1 is a representative HRTEM
image showing particle size, crystallinity, and morphology of Zinkicide
NPs in the vacuum state. The image reveals the spherical shape of
the particles with average diameters of ∼4 nm. First, the fluorescence
of Zinkicide upon UV excitation was assessed (Figure S2). Agriculture-grade Zinkicide stock (57,000 ppm
(v/v) of metallic Zn) was supplied by the TradeMark Nitrogen Inc.
(Tampa, FL). Zinkicide was diluted to 1000 ppm from the original stock
solution of 57,000 ppm in two separate sample fractions with water
and citric acid buffer and was deposited on ethanol-cleaned glass
slides. The fluorescence emission of the two samples was captured
using ChemiDoc XRS+ with a UV preset for excitation (Figure S2a). Complementary images were acquired using the
UV-transilluminator for UV excitation and obtained with a camera phone
(Figure S2b). These measurements confirmed
sufficient fluorescence intensities of Zinkicide in aqueous solutions
upon UV light excitation.

The detection of Zinkicide using polyacrylamide
gel (15%) electrophoresis was performed using UV imaging of SDS-PAGE
gels loaded with Zinkicide NPs diluted in water with varying concentrations
(Figure 1 and Table S1). Figure 1a,b exhibits the two-dimensional (2D) gel image of
Zinkicide and the three-dimensional (3D) rendering of the gel captured
with the gel-imaging device. The 3D image was orientated into a 3D
landscape utilizing the Bio-Rad Image Lab software (see Methods for details) to make the intensity profile changes
easier to observe (Figure 1b). Analysis of the UV images of the gels allowed us to quantify
Zinkicide concentration-dependent fluorescence intensities (Figure 1c) ranging from 445
to 28,500 ppm (Figure 1). Zinkicide concentrations were determined to have linear proportionality
to fluorescence intensity emissions of Zinkicide. Similar measurements
were carried out to measure fluorescence intensity emissions of lower
stock concentrations of Zinkicide (Figure S3 and Table S2). To achieve this, Zinkicide was diluted from a stock
concentration of 1000 ppm to lower concentrations using twofold serial
dilutions in water. Next, the particles were loaded in the 15% polyacrylamide
gels, imaged, and quantified using the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS+ and Bio-Rad
Image Lab software. The results show that using SDS-PAGE UV gel imaging
and analysis, Zinkicide concentrations ranging from 16 to 28,500 ppm
could be measured. The intensities coincided with the designed concentration
dilutions and were found to exhibit high degrees of proportionality
(Figure S3 and Table S2).

conditions of Zinkicide were recorded at the following concentrations:
lane 1: 445 ppm, lane 2: 890 ppm, lane 3: 1781 ppm, lane 4: 3562 ppm,
lane 5: 7125 ppm, lane 6: 14,250 ppm, and lane 7: 28,500 ppm.

2.2 Intensity Tracking of Zinkicide
The
evolution of Zinkicide fluorescence intensity changes in solution
was evaluated using polyacrylamide gel (15%) electrophoresis and imaging
of SDS-PAGE gels (Figure 2 and Table S3). Zinkicide was diluted
in deionized water to 1000 ppm and incubated at increasing times.

image of Zinkicide diluted at 1000 ppm in double deionized water (ddH2O) at varying time incubations. (b) 3D rendering of SDS-PAGE

over 16 days. Uncertainty bars represent the standard deviation (SD)
(d) Corresponding UV-transilluminator image of the gel. The loading
of Zinkicide was 1000 ppm at the following time points: lane 1: 0
h control, lane 2: 10 day, lane 3: 13 day, lane 4: 14 day, lane 5:
15 day, and lane 6: 16 day.

The time selected ranged from 10 to 16 days to determine the fate
of the NPs as the foliar treatments on citrus trees at recommended
spray frequencies of the bactericides for in-field applications.8,9 The aged Zinkicide was loaded into the SDS-PAGE gels under constant
loading conditions and run with our electrophoresis protocol. The
2D and 3D gel images were captured and analyzed. Fluorescence intensity
changes of aged Zinkicide in aqueous solution were quantified (Figure 2 and Table S3).

Fluctuations in fluorescence
intensities were observed in the 2D
and 3D images where the low point of intensity was recorded in lane
3 and the highest intensity was measured in lane 6 (Figure 2a,b). The plot in Figure 2c indicates that
time-dependent imaging and tracking of Zinkicide in tandem with SDS-PAGE
were applicable. To provide further evidence of the validity of tracking
fluorescence intensity variation of Zinkicide with gel electrophoresis,
we used UV-transilluminator imaging (Figure 2d) to characterize the same gel previously
studied with the Bio-Rad device. In the UV-transilluminator image,
the low point of intensity was observed at lane 3 and the high point
of intensity was recorded at lane 6 (Figure 2d). This result was consistent with the high
precision measurements obtained using the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS+. The
samples incubated for longer time intervals became more fluorescent.

The fluctuation of fluorescence intensities could be linked to
increase in surface defects because of aging of Zinkicide in solution.
In addition, ZnO NPs exposed to solutions over time are known to release
zinc ions via the dissolution process.4,14,21,31,32 The dissolution kinetics have been shown to produce increased fluorescence
in time-dependent photoluminescence studies with ZnO NPs.33 There are three general factors that could contribute
to dissolution and/or the generation of surface defects for NPs: (i)
surface chemistry effects, (ii) external factors, and (iii) size and
surface area effects.34 These physiochemical
factors could independently or collectively contribute to dissolution
of Zinkicide and promote increased fluorescence.

2.3 Tracking Molecular Weight Changes of Zinkicide
in Different Media
Zinkicide molecular weight changes were
tracked using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and UV imaging of
gels loaded with Zinkicide NPs dispersed in water and citric acid
buffer over time. The results reveal that the overall molecular weight
decrease of Zinkicide is a function of the solution pH (Figures 3 and S4, and Table S4). The molecular weight of Zinkicide in citric
acid buffer (pH = 3.0) decreased faster than in ddH2O (pH
= 7.0). After 7 days, Zinkicide NPs incubated in citric acid buffer
resulted in a molecular weight decrease of 12.23% while those incubated
in ddH2O caused a molecular weight decrease of 4.18%. We
tracked these molecular weight changes as a percentage decrease because
the native Zinkicide molecular weights were found to exhibit molecular
weights less than 10 kDa.

Figure 3 Tracking molecular weight changes of Zinkicide
over time. The NPs
were incubated over time in two media with different pH. The plot
is representative of normalized data for Zinkicide NPs in water (black)
and citric acid buffer (red). Solid lines represent best fits (exponential
decay) of the data. Samples incubated in citric acid buffer exhibited
a greater reduction in the molecular weight due to the acidic environment.

We interpreted that the greater effect of molecular
weight changes
in citric acid buffer could be attributed to the acidic environments
of the buffer solution which in turn induced greater degradation of
the NPs over extended time intervals.4,12,14 This may be directly related to increased dissolution
of the bactericidal NPs.16 It has been
shown that the dissolution rates of ZnO NPs are inversely proportional
to the particles size and surface area.13 Hence, smaller NPs or NPs which have been degraded can increase
the rate of ion dissolution.8 The in vivo
acidic environment in citrus is within the range of the citric acid
buffer environment (pH 3.0) of our in vitro studies.14,15 This result is crucial for future applications of ZnO for bactericidal
crop management tactics. The molecular weight results identified the
notion that if the ZnO NPs are indeed systemically delivered to the
interior compartment of crops, the material would have the magnitude
to degrade readily at the fruit level of the crops and in fruit juices.4,8,14,35,36 Tracking molecular weight changes of Zinkicide
is important for predicting its stability in planta. The design of
Zinkicide aging studies in buffer-controlled solutions is important
for providing evidence that the material should be able to safely
degrade over time.

3 Conclusions
In this
study, using SDS-PAGE, we have developed a facile and cost-effective
tool to monitor the dissolution of Zinkicide, a bactericidal NP treatment
designed to manage citrus diseases. We established the linear dependency
between Zinkicide fluorescence intensity and its concentration in
the gel. Next, we established that the dissolution of Zinkicide dispersed
in aqueous solutions is accompanied by a molecular weight change and
a change in the fluorescence intensity. The acidity of the aqueous
solvents used to mimic the conditions of Zinkicide in the field was
found to have a greater impact on the kinetics of dissolution. The
developed protocol for quantification of NPs in aqueous solution can
be utilized for other fluorescent NP characterization as a unique
and cost-effective methodology. Several traditional NP characterization
tools are expensive, time-consuming, and nonreliable, especially for
ultra-small NPs (<10 nm) because of high dispersibility and dissolution
of smaller NPs at low concentrations. These findings are important
for stability assessments of commercially available nanomaterials
in solution.

4 Methods
4.1 NP Materials
Agriculture-grade Zinkicide
(4.5% metallic Zn) was obtained from our collaborator TradeMark Nitrogen
Inc. (TMN, Tampa, FL).27 The material was
studied as received without further purification. Figure S1 shows the representative HRTEM image of Zinkicide.

4.2 NP Preparation and Loading in SDS-PAGE Gels
Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN Tetrad glass/short plates were used for hand-casting
8.3 cm × 7.3 cm SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad, USA). Stacking gel concentration
of 6% and resolving gel acrylamide concentration of 15% were determined
to be the optimal gel conditions for resolving changes in Zinkicide.
Twenty microliters of the NP samples was aliquoted into labeled 0.6
mL test tubes and vortexed. An amount of 2.5 μL of 4× Laemmli
sample buffer dye was added to the samples. For gel orientation, only
(not used for molecular weight quantification) 10 μL of the
Bio-Rad Precision Plus Protein All Blue Standard was loaded into the
first lane of the 15-well gels. The device was run at 150 V, 500 mA,
for 50 min in 500 mL of Tris-glycine electrode buffer. Following electrophoresis,
the gels were excised from the glass plates and stored in Rainin gel
box containers with ddH2O to prevent drying. No stain or
destain protocols were used in these experiments.

4.3 UV SDS-PAGE Gel Imaging and Analysis
Gel samples were
imaged with the Bio-Rad Chemidoc XRS+, which uses
a mercury UVB lamp with a wavelength of 302 nm. The device was computer-controlled
using Bio-Rad Image Lab software for image acquisition. Once gels
were placed into the device, the Image Lab software was loaded and
the preset parameter (UV) was selected for imaging. The gels were
aligned manually and using the digital alignment grid in the software.
The images were captured using the imaging device and saved as .scn
files for analysis with the same software. Secondary image files were
saved as .tiff for image documentation.

Gel analysis was performed
using the same software. The software enables precise measurements
of molecular weight, fluorescence intensity, relative mobility (Rf), and quantity tools for relative and absolute
volumes. For molecular weight studies, a custom molecular weight ladder
was developed. The custom digital marker was designed to measure the
Zinkicide molecular weight from 0 to 100% in the gels with the Image
Lab software. This setting was used to track the molecular weight
changes of the samples over time when incubated in pH-dependent media.
The selected marker bands were adjusted using the digital band manipulation
tools in the software to maximize the coverage of the bottom and top
bands in the custom marker system. These markers were placed in three
positions across the gel to sustain detection integrity and precision.
The values of relative molecular weights were recorded using the software,
and the percent decrease was calculated by using the molecular weight
of the control (t = 0 h) in relation to the other
samples.

4.4 Zinkicide Fluorescence Intensity Measurements
on Glass Slides
Zinkicide was diluted to 1000 ppm in water
and citric acid buffer in separate microcentrifuge tubes. Two glass
slides were rinsed with 70% ethanol and water and dried with KimWipes.
Twenty microliters of the Zinkicide sample diluted with water was
loaded onto the first slide and 20 μL of the Zinkicide sample
diluted with citric acid buffer was loaded onto the second slide.
The slides were placed in the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS+ and captured using
the UV preset in Bio-Rad Image Lab Software. The identical slides
were placed on the UV-transilluminator and the images were captured
with a smart phone camera.

4.5 Zinkicide Detection and
Quantification
The NPs were vortexed for 1 min and shaken
vigorously in the stock
50 mL conical tubes to disperse the nanoparticle solutions. The samples
for the concentration measurement using SDS-PAGE were serially diluted
from the stock concentration of 28,500 ppm using twofold serial dilutions
for the following six sample conditions.

For intensity measurement,
NPs were diluted to 1000 ppm in 15 mL conical tubes with ddH2O for all sample conditions. The diluted samples (1000 ppm) were
aged at selected time intervals which included 0 h control, 10 day,
13 day, 14 day, 15 day, and 16 day. The diluted/aged samples were
loaded into 15% SDS-PAGE gels and run under the prior-listed SDS-PAGE
protocol. The 2D and 3D images were captured with the Bio-Rad Chemidoc
XRS+ and the secondary images were obtained using a UV-transilluminator
device and captured with a camera phone. Image analysis was conducted
with Bio-Rad Image Lab software.
