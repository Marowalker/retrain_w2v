Herein, we present a method for the preparation of titanium
dioxide
with a relatively large surface area, mesoporosity, and good thermal
stability. We show that by utilizing molten salt hydrates (MSH) as
non-trivial synthesis media, we prepare materials with thin, flake-like
morphology with a large aspect ratio. The thickness of the synthesized
flakes can be controlled by adjusting the salt/water (always in the
MSH regime) and/or the salt/precursor molar ratio. The TiO2 flakes appear to be formed via the aggregation of small TiO2 nanoparticles (typically around 7–8 nm) in an apparent
2D morphology. We hypothesize that the ordered structure of water
molecules within the ions of the salt in conjunction with the fast
hydrolysis/condensation rates occurring in the presence of water of
the precursor used are responsible for this agglomeration. We also
report that the purity of materials (anatase vs brookite crystalline
phase) appears to be a function of the LiBr/water ratio which is hypothesized
to arise either from pH variation or due to lattice matching of the
relevant orthorhombic structures (brookite and LiBrx·3H2O). Discussion on the potential for scalability
of the presented method is also highlighted in this article.

1 Introduction
The undoubtable importance
of titanium dioxide (TiO2) is underscored by its vast potential
applications in various fields
encompassing but not limited to sensing,1−3 lithium-, aluminum-,
and sodium-ion batteries,4−6 dye-sensitized solar cells,7−10 and catalysis.11−14 The reasons behind the versatility of TiO2 lie in its
intrinsic properties such as low cost, nontoxicity, chemical stability,
acidity, specific surface area, and relatively good thermal stability.
These properties of TiO2 have led to the development of
a variety of metal or metal oxide catalysts supported on TiO2 surfaces that can be utilized in highly important catalytic reactions
such as the selective NOx reduction,15 hydrodesulfurization,16 water–gas shift,17 oxidative dehydrogenation,18−20 and so forth. Besides thermal catalysis, TiO2 finds wide
applications in photocatalytic reactions due to its very good semiconducting
properties.13,21−23 Among the crystalline
phases of TiO2, anatase has been widely utilized in the
field of catalysis primarily due to its higher surface area as compared
to the other phases.24−26 TiO2 with mixed crystalline phases such
as anatase–rutile or anatase–brookite have shown improved
chemical stability as well as photocatalytic activity with the former
being the most common mixture employed.

Research endeavors have
been aimed at controlling the morphology
and crystalline structure of TiO2, which in turn control
its physicochemical properties, by applying different synthesis protocols.24 Various structural designs have been reported
including TiO2 spheres, fibers and tubes, nanosheets, films,
and larger interconnected architectures and their relevant properties
are discussed elsewhere.27 TiO2 in the form of thin flakes, films, nanosheets, or even 2D structures
has received considerable attention due to their enhanced reactivity
in photocatalytic as well as in several heterogeneous catalytic reactions.28 The reasons behind the promising catalytic behavior
associated with these materials stem from the numerous opportunities
that exist to tune the morphology and molecular structure during synthesis
and post-treatment. Besides their high specific surface area, the
possible exposure of the [001] high-energy facet has been predominantly
underscored in the open literature as among one of the reasons behind
the improved reactivity of TiO2 sheets.29,30 In the anatase crystalline form of titanium dioxide, the [001] is
present as a small fraction because the [101] usually dominates the
nanocrystalline particles. The recent interest in facet-controlled
design of TiO2 has led research endeavors to be focused
on developing synthetic protocols where nanoparticles with high portion
of exposed [001] facet are organized to form 2D-like TiO2 materials.30 These materials have an
apparent 2D morphology because they present a thickness of few nanometers
as opposed to 2D nanosheets derived usually via exfoliation of titanates
that present thickness at the molecular or even atomic level.31 This field has experienced rapid growth recently
due to the potential applications in Li-ion batteries as anodes and
in dye-sensitized solar cells; several authors have reported novel
approaches that utilize surface capping agents to control exposed
facets which in turn can guide chemical reactivity. However, scaling
up these synthetic protocols is hampered by the fact that the highly
toxic hydrofluoric acid is usually employed in high concentrations.

Molten salt synthesis (MSS) has been reported as an efficient method
to synthesize a vast number of metal oxides by utilizing a melting
salt as a solvent. The MSS method is a nonaqueous route that allows
the synthesis of relatively thermally and chemically stable metal
oxides; as water is absent, highly reactive metal oxide precursors
have been also used.32 Recently, the MSS
method has been reported to produce TiO2 nanosheets that
exhibit improved capacity as compared to the bare TiO2,
as well as better activity in dye-sensitized solar cells.33,34 The free ions in the molten salt medium have been underscored to
be instrumental in binding the high-energy facets and consequently
stabilizing them. In general, the MSS method is simple and versatile
and recently has been highlighted as being scalable for the production
of 2D oxides and hydroxides due to its short reaction time (∼1
min).35 Although through the MSS route,
highly crystalline materials with controlled facets can be synthesized,36 the high operating temperature comprises the
main drawback considering potential industrial realization.

Besides the effect of the free ions in the molten salt route, very
recently, the nature of salt solid crystals has been underscored to
play a key role in a novel synthetic approach.37 In this synthetic strategy, metal oxide precursors were
first dissolved in ethanol to avoid rapid nucleation of oxide nanocrystals
and then a small amount of the solution was mixed with a large amount
of solid salt crystals. It is hypothesized that the lattice matching
between the salt solid crystals and the desired growing metal oxide
is pivotal in controlling the 2D morphology, whereas the salt/precursor
ratio controls the thickness of the final oxide. The excess ethanol
used in conjunction with the large amount of solid salt crystals (making
the synthesis medium highly heterogeneous) could be considered as
the main drawbacks of this method.

In this work, we report a
novel and simple synthesis strategy where
molten salt hydrates (MSH) are utilized as solvents for the production
of TiO2 flakes. We hypothesize that the ordered structure
of the MSH medium is responsible for guiding the agglomeration of
small TiO2 nanoparticles (∼7–8 nm) to an
apparent 2D-like morphology with a large aspect ratio and tunable
thickness. Specifically, aqueous lithium bromide (LiBr) solutions
with various H2O/salt molar ratio, always within the MSH
regime, have been investigated in order to study possible morphological
and structural changes of TiO2. This new synthesis strategy
occurs at nearly ambient temperature and short reaction times due
to the high reactivity between the TiO2 precursor and water;
calcination comprises the only post-synthesis heat treatment. We also
evaluate the effect of salt/precursor as well as water/precursor on
controlling the aspect ratio and thickness of the TiO2 prepared.
We use in situ Raman measurements to follow the calcination steps
and to evaluate the long-term thermal stability of the prepared materials.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Titanium(IV) isopropoxide,
(99.99% trace metals basis), lithium bromide (ReagentPlus, ≥99%),
and titanium(IV) oxide (brookite and rutile) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and used without further purification. Titanium(IV) oxide (anatase)
was purchased from Alfa Aesar.

2.2 Synthesis Protocol
Herein, we describe
the sequence of all required steps that have been followed in order
to prepare the TiO2 thin flakes. A schematic representation
of the synthesis procedure is depicted in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation of the Sequence
of the Proposed Steps to
Prepare TiO2 Flakes
The first step encompasses the preparation of
the solvent medium
that is used to conduct hydrolysis and condensation of the precursor.
We use MSHs as the reaction medium, that is, solutions with water
to salt molar ratio equal to or less than the coordination number
of the cation.38 In a typical synthesis
procedure, precalculated amount of lithium bromide (LiBr) is added
in 10–15 mL of deionized water in order to prepare solutions
in the range of 3.25–5 H2O/LiBr molar ratio. This
range ensures that the solution pertains to the MSH state.38,39 The prepared solution is maintained at the temperature of 35 °C
in an oil bath under stirring for around 30 min. After we ensure that
the solution temperature is stable, a known amount (1–5 mL
depending on the required scale) of the titanium oxide precursor (titanium
isopropoxide, TTIP) is added to the solution under vigorous stirring.
After the addition of TTIP, the solution is maintained at 35 °C
for 1 h in the presence of reflux in order to promote hydrolysis and
condensation of the precursor and form the corresponding titanium
hydroxide. Depending on the synthesis conditions, the LiBr/TTIP ratio
is controlled in the range of 13–80. The precipitate is filtered
with a Büchner funnel under reduced pressure and washed thoroughly
with water. In the cases of large LiBr/TTIP, the material can be also
recovered by means of centrifugation. The final solid material is
collected and dried overnight at 110 °C under static air. The
dried whitish powder is calcined at the temperature of 400 °C
for 3 h with a ramp of 2 °C/min in a tubular furnace. The calcined
material is then used for further characterization.

2.3 Characterization of Materials
Raman
spectra were recorded using a HORIBA LabRAM HR Evolution high spatial
and spectral resolution spectrometer. The incident beam (532 nm, 80
mW) was directed into a reaction cell (Harrick Scientific Products
Inc.) and focused on the sample with a 10× long-working distance
objective. Collection of the scattered light was achieved with an
air-cooled (−75 °C) open electrode 1024 × 256 pixels
CCD. The acquisition time of each spectrum was 20–60 s, the
number of accumulations varied in the range of 6–12, and the
spectral slit was fixed at 100 μm. A 25–50% neutral density
filter was also used to avoid local overheating of the catalyst sample
which can cause changes in the measured spectra. For the in situ Raman
calcination measurements, air flow is maintained at 50–100
cm2/min via a mass flow controller (Alicat Scientific).

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired with a
Zeiss, Zeiss Sigma field emission scanning electron microscope. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired with a JEM-2010F (JEOL,
Japan) transmission electron microscope equipped with a field emission
gun emitter. The specific surface area of the prepared TiO2 samples was estimated through the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method using a Quantachrome, Autosorb-1 instrument. The BET
measurements were carried out at liquid nitrogen temperature after
degassing samples at 150 °C for 3 h.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Thermal Stability and Structural Implications
via in Situ Raman Calcination
Figure 1a,b shows the room-temperature Raman spectrum
(at two different Raman shift regimes) of the TiO2 sample
that has been calcined at 400 °C and prepared at H2O/LiBr and LiBr/TTIP equal to 3.25 and 13, respectively. According
to the factor group analysis of anatase-TiO2, six allowed
Raman modes can be observed based on the A1g + 2B1g + 3Eg representation. The main band shown in Figure 1a and located at
145 cm–1 corresponds to the Eg(ν6) vibrational mode of the anatase crystal form of TiO2. The position as well as the sharp character of this band
is indicative of relatively crystalline material. The 198, 399, 518,
and 639 cm–1 bands correspond to the rest of the
optical phonon modes of anatase TiO2, that is, Eg(ν5), B1g(ν4), B1g(ν2)/A1g(ν3),
and Eg(ν1), respectively.40 A closer look at the 145 cm–1 band reveals
a slightly asymmetric character toward higher Raman shift, whereas
at the 200–350 cm–1 spectral regime, multiple
low-intensity bands were also observed. The position of these vibrational
bands indicates the presence of a brookite crystal in the structure
of the synthesized TiO2. The low intensities of the brookite
phase underscore its small fraction in the synthesized material. This
observation is in agreement with our X-ray diffraction (XRD) results
shown in the Supporting Information (Figure
S1), as well as TEM measurements that are discussed later. However,
it is worth mentioning that the Raman cross section of each crystalline
phase in principle can differ, thus contributing to a different extent
in the apparent spectral intensities. According to the Raman spectrum
of pure brookite (shown in the Supporting Information as well, Figure S2) high-intensity bands are expected to overlap
with the 145 cm–1 band and thus a deconvolution
of the pertinent spectral envelope is also shown as an inset in Figure 1a.

Figure 1 Raman spectrum of TiO2 prepared after calcination at
400 °C at the (a) 75–350 and (b) 225–900 cm–1 spectral ranges. Pertinent deconvolution using Gaussian
peaks is depicted as the inset. (c,d) show the in situ Raman calcination
data at the same spectral envelopes. The temperature ramp was set
to 2 °C/min; spectral collection microscope objective was 100×;
laser wavelength was 532 nm.

In an effort to follow the structural changes occurring
in our
samples upon calcination as well as their intrinsic thermal stability,
in situ Raman temperature-dependent spectra have been collected in
the 25–600 °C range and are shown in Figure 1c,d. Starting from the dried
sample right after the synthesis and prior to any calcination procedure,
we collect in situ Raman spectra upon heating with a temperature ramp
of 2 °C/min that mimics the calcination process we follow in
the tubular furnace, as discussed in the experimental part. All spectra
have been normalized and vertically translated for better representation.
The spectral envelope of Figure 1c (75–350 cm–1) shows mainly
the Eg(ν6) vibrational mode of anatase
TiO2, whereas the Eg(ν5) appears
as a weak shoulder at ∼200 cm–1. It is evident
that at 25 °C, our synthesis method leads to TiO2 material
that shows some extent of crystallinity even prior to calcination
as underscored by the clear presence of all vibrational modes of anatase
(Figure 1c,d). It is
worth mentioning here that the Eg(ν6)
band appears at 150 cm–1 as opposed to 145 cm–1 for the post-calcined material. This is ascribed
to the smaller size of crystallites that are formed during the synthesis
and drying procedure.41,42 It is known that sol–gel
methods usually lead to amorphous or poorly crystalline TiO2 materials.24,43,44 This arises from the fact that the rates of hydrolysis and condensation
are usually very fast and hard to control due to the presence of excess
of water. We believe that the presence of crystalline domains in our
samples, as the Raman data indicate, might be due to the minimal amount
of water present in the reaction medium that allows the crystallization
process of TiO2 material to occur. In addition, the significant
amount of ions, due to the dissociation of LiBr, may act as complexing
agents, which in turn may also decrease either the hydrolysis or condensation
rates. This hypothesis is in line with a modified sol–gel method
reported elsewhere, where titanium alkoxides undergo hydrolysis/condensation
in a controlled manner in the presence of 1 M NaCl and pluronic P-123
triblock copolymer.45 It is evident that
upon heating, the frequency as well as the width of the anatase peaks
change significantly. Specifically, the Eg(ν6) band at 150 cm–1 shifts to higher wavenumbers
(155 cm–1) and broadens. The bands at 399, 518,
and 639 cm–1 broaden as well but shift to lower
wavenumbers. This behavior is in agreement with reported temperature-dependent
spectra of TiO2 nanocrystals where phonon confinement,
nonstoichiometric domains, as well as anharmonic effects have been
proposed to contribute to this behavior.40,42,46

As our synthesis procedure leads to
the incorporation of a small
fraction of brookite in the TiO2 anatase, one expects that
the apparent blue shift observed on the Eg(ν6) band will have a contribution from changes occurring in
the brookite phase as well upon heating. Toward this, it is our intent
to probe the sequential changes of the individual components that
lead to the overall convoluted 150 cm–1 spectral
shift. 2D-correlation Raman spectra have been constructed by using
the dynamic Raman data acquired at different temperatures and an average
spectrum as the reference. The synchronous and asynchronous spectra
are shown in Figure 2a,b respectively. In general, the appearance of an autopeak (peak
at the diagonal of the synchronous spectrum) suggests significant
spectral intensity variations at the observed Raman shift.47−50 The peaks located at the diagonal of the synchronous spectrum show
the overall intensity susceptibility of two different spectral bands
located at ∼148 and 160 cm–1 to the external
perturbation that is applied,49 which in
our case is temperature. We ascribe these peaks to anatase and brookite
bands, respectively. The presence of a negative sign of the cross
peaks (peaks off diagonal that show a correlation between the two
crystalline phases) implies that one of the Raman intensities (either
of anatase or brookite) is increasing, while the other is decreasing.48,49 In addition, the asynchronous spectrum (Figure 2b) shows two distinct cross peaks. As the
sign of the synchronous and asynchronous cross peaks at the same spectral
location (160, 145 cm–1) is different, one can assume
that changes in the brookite phase (spectral variation at 160 cm–1) occur at a later stage than anatase (spectral variation
at 145 cm–1). Because temperature is monotonically
increasing with time, we can assume that changes in the brookite phase
start occurring at relatively higher temperatures (above 400 °C).
In order to strengthen this argument, we have collected in situ Raman
temperature-dependent spectra of commercial highly crystalline anatase
for comparison and 2D Raman correlation has been also constructed
(see Figure S3 of the Supporting Information). In the asynchronous spectrum, there is a pair of cross peaks at
(145, 148 cm–1) with a “butterfly”
pattern that, according to Noda,51 is indicative
of a shift to higher wavenumbers highlighting that the aforementioned
behavior is due to the presence of both anatase and brookite.

Figure 2 (a) Synchronous
and (b) asynchronous 2D Raman maps of titanium
dioxide synthesized as a function of temperature. The temperature
range used for the generation of the 2D Raman maps was 25–600
°C. The correlation spectra were developed by utilizing the 2D
application available in the Origin 2019b software.

3.2 Effect of H2O/LiBr on the Crystal
Structure and Morphology of the Synthesized TiO2
A systematic variation of the H2O/LiBr ratio has been
conducted in an effort to investigate possible changes in the crystalline
phase, morphology, and physicochemical properties of the prepared
TiO2 materials. We have synthesized materials within the
3.25–5 range of the H2O/LiBr ratio that is in line
with the MSH regime. The Raman data shown in Figure 3a show that the dominant crystalline phase
in all cases is anatase. However, a closer look of the Raman spectra
reveals a monotonic trend that is also depicted in Figure 3b, that is, the higher the
H2O/LiBr ratio, the smaller the fraction of brookite observed.
Exceeding the MSH regime (H2O/LiBr equals to 15), brookite
was observed at very low content. This observation could be explained
by the fact that the addition of significant amount of salts in water
leads to a pH decrease which in turn could favor the formation of
mixed phases (anatase, brookite, rutile).24 However, in our case, we do not observe any fraction of rutile crystal
TiO2. On the other hand, one cannot exclude the possibility
of lattice matching between salt hydrates and TiO2 crystal
phases. LiBrx·3H2O, that
is very close to the H2O/LiBr ratio of 3.25, as well as
brookite, both have an orthorhombic structure, and thus, we hypothesize
that small brookite domains might arise due to this lattice matching.52 This is in agreement with recent research showing
that lattice matching between salt solid crystals and the desired
growing metal oxide is pivotal in controlling the crystal phase and
overall morphology.37 In the same work,
the salt/precursor ratio is an important parameter that can potentially
control the thickness of the final 2D-like oxide. We will discuss
the effect of this ratio on our results in a later section.

Figure 3 Ex situ Raman
spectra of TiO2 samples prepared at different
H2O/LiBr molar ratio (left) and change of the apparent
brookite/anatase amount (right) as described by the intensity ratio
of the 325 cm–1(brookite) and 400 cm–1 (anatase) Raman bands.

To investigate the morphology of the synthesized
TiO2, SEM measurements were conducted on a series of materials
that span
the 3.25–5 range of the H2O/LiBr ratio. In all materials,
the LiBr/TTIP ratio has been kept constant at the value of 13. Micrographs
of all MSH-derived TiO2 are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S4). All TiO2 samples
that have been prepared using molten LiBr hydrates at different ratios
as reaction media show the presence of flakes or even thin, film-like
materials of various sizes, shapes, and thickness. In the presence
of H2O/LiBr = 3.25, we observe thick flakes with irregular
shapes and sizes within ∼0.5–4 μm. Increasing
H2O/LiBr, the apparent lateral size of the flakes increases,
whereas the thickness seems to slightly decrease. These results highlight
the possibility of controlling the size and thickness of the prepared
TiO2 flakes by adjusting the amount of water present in
the MSH medium. At higher H2O/LiBr but still within the
MSH regime, in addition to very small TiO2 flakes, larger
sheets of ∼20 μm were also observed.

High-resolution
SEM images were collected to further investigate
the morphological behavior of the synthesized TiO2 flakes.
In Figure 4a–c
we show the high-resolution micrographs of the TiO2 prepared
at a H2O/LiBr ratio equal to 3.75 as a representative material
with flakes of relatively large aspect ratio. Low magnification of
the materials recovered through this synthesis protocol shows aggregates
of ∼20–30 μm comprising many flakes. A closer
look reveals that the TiO2 flakes coexist with very small
particles with an apparent spherical geometry. Higher magnification
of the TiO2 flakes show a thickness in the range of 50–150
nm. Focusing at the edge of the TiO2 flakes, one can clearly
observe that these flakes are composed via ordered agglomeration of
spherical nanoparticles within the 5–10 nm range.

SEM micrographs of the TiO2 prepared
at a H2O/LiBr ratio equal to 3.75 at different level of
magnification. Scale bars at (a) 1 μm, (b) 100 nm, and (c) 20
nm

In order to elucidate structural differences between
the different
prepared samples, we studied the morphology of representative samples
via TEM. Representative TEM images are shown in Figure 5 for the sample with H2O/LiBr
at 3.25 at different levels of magnification. In the images shown,
at low magnification, we observe thin film-like agglomerates of various
sizes with a large aspect ratio. At low H2O/LiBr ratio,
the TiO2 films appear to be smaller in the lateral direction
and thicker that those prepared at higher H2O/LiBr (see
the Supporting Information). HRTEM images
reveal that small crystalline TiO2 nanoparticles with an
average particle size within 5–7 nm are assembled in such a
way that an apparent 2D-like growth is achieved (Figure S5). We also observe the coexistence of anatase and
brookite crystalline phases of TiO2, as shown in the fast
Fourier transform image where both anatase (101) and brookite (211)
facets can be visualized. This result is in agreement with our Raman
and XRD results discussed earlier. From the TEM images presented herein,
it is also shown that the agglomeration of the nanoparticles to thin
TiO2 flakes leads to interparticle free space in the mesoporous
regime. This result, in conjunction with the very small particle size
observed in most of the samples, is indicative of a potential high
surface area. To investigate this more, we conducted surface area
and porosity measurements that are discussed next.

Figure 5 TEM images of the synthesized
TiO2 flakes at H2O/LiBr molar ratio equal to
3.25 and LiBr/TTIP equal to 13. The material
shown here has been calcined at 400 °C with 2 °C/min rate.

BET surface area along with porosity measurements
were conducted
for all synthesized samples and are summarized in Table 1. We find that the TiO2 samples prepared show surface area ∼200 m2/g with
the highest pore volume to be around 0.27 cm3/g for the
sample 3.25/13. The surface area seems to be constant throughout the
different synthesized samples that were prepared within the MSH regime;
outside this regime (sample 15/13), the surface area decreases. The
relatively high surface area arises from the very small size of the
TiO2 nanoparticles, but one cannot exclude always the possibility
of a contribution due to small amorphous domains. The adsorption isotherms
and pore-size distribution of all samples are presented in Figure 6a,b. For some samples,
we observe an H2 type of hysteresis loop, which is indicative of possible
pore blocking and/or cavitation-induced evaporation.53 The presented results herein show mesoporous materials
with pore sizes in the range of 4–8 nm. We ascribe this “well-defined”
behavior to the ordered agglomeration of the TiO2 nanoparticles,
as we discussed earlier in our TEM results. We believe that this ordered
agglomeration allows the nanoparticles to rearrange and reorganize
themselves in a unique way, thus creating interparticle space with
similar size (apparent mesopore diameter).

isotherms and (b) pore-size distribution.

3.3 Effect of LiBr/TTIP on the Purity and Thickness
of TiO2 Flakes
To further examine pertinent morphological
and structural changes, the ratio between the salt added in water
and the required metal oxide precursor, that is, the LiBr/TTIP ratio,
is studied in this section. We hypothesize that lower amounts of TiO2 precursor can lead to thinner TiO2 films while
maintaining similar morphology, as described in the previous section.
In Figure 7, we report
the Raman spectra of four samples, at different (13, 50, 80, and 120)
LiBr/TTIP and same (3.75) H2O/LiBr ratio. In all four samples,
the anatase crystalline form of TiO2 is maintained and
is the dominant phase. A closer look reveals that by increasing the
LiBr/TTIP ratio, our synthesis methods lead to a higher intensity
of the anatase vibrational bands, indicating more uniform and overall
pure TiO2-anatase material. In addition, at high LiBr/TTIP
ratio, the vibrational bands are sharper, underscoring much higher
crystallinity of the synthesized samples. It is worth mentioning here
that the bands pertaining to brookite decrease significantly as we
increase the LiBr/TTIP ratio, thus highlighting the possibility of
controlling the relative concentration between the two different crystalline
phases. Similar spectral trend was found for other samples that were
prepared, and pertinent Raman spectra are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S5). The relative
brookite/anatase ratio is also shown in Figure 7. The statistical significance of the synthesized
materials at a low LiBr/TTIP ratio is larger than the error at high
LiBr/TTIP. It is worth highlighting here that we use Raman spectroscopy
where the incident beam is directed on the surface through a microscope
objective. Depending on the sample location as well as the spatial
resolution of the objective, the spectra for the same material might
slightly differ due to the different contribution of larger or smaller
crystallites to the overall spectrum. To estimate the reported statistical
error (Figure 7), two
different objectives (10× and 100×) have been used and five
measurements at different locations have been averaged. Relevant data
are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S6). The TEM images for samples that have been synthesized
at H2O/LiBr ratio 3.25 and high LiBr/TTIP ratio (50) are
shown in Figure 8.
The results support our hypothesis that lower amounts of the precursor
lead to thinner TiO2 films, whereas the lateral size seems
to also decrease. Similar nanoparticle agglomeration was also observed
under these synthesis conditions. These results underscore the possibility
of controlling the apparent thickness of the synthesized TiO2 flakes by carefully tuning the synthesis parameters. Future work
on parametrization and optimization of our synthesis method can shed
light in this direction.

3.4 Insights into the Nature of the Synthesis
Route and Potential Scalability
This work focuses on the
use of MSHs and specifically LiBr hydrates as non-trivial synthesis
solvent media. As mentioned earlier, these solutions have water to
salt molar ratio equal or less than the coordination number of the
cation. It is reported that MSHs can be described as low-temperature
melts that exhibit only ion–water interactions, with no water–water
or ion–ion interactions taking place. In addition to the fact
that the ions of the salt are not well separated, these solutions
have the ability to maintain an ordered structure of water within
the salt ions.52 We hypothesize that this
ordered structure is responsible for the ordered agglomeration of
small TiO2 nanoparticles in an apparent film-like morphology.
As the titanium alkoxide precursor reacts very fast with water molecules,
we believe that the hydrolysis and condensation occur rapidly in the
regimes of water molecules that interact only with the dissociated
ions. Because of minimal water–water interactions within the
solvent system, we also hypothesize that further TiO2 condensation
in the directions that can lead to bulk agglomerates is prohibited.

In addition, the MSH solvent media show low water activity,54 high acidity (especially in the presence of
acids38), and enhanced viscosity.55 All these parameters could be potentially critical
in the synthesis of metal oxides. For instance, it has been reported
that the change in the viscosity of the synthesis medium can have
a significant effect on the formation of thin TiO2 flakes.56 As there is an increased viscosity of the MSH
medium as compared to neat water, the possibility that this slightly
affects the morphology of the flakes cannot be excluded. However,
by changing the stirring speed in our synthesis procedure, we do not
observe significant change in the thickness or the apparent “aspect
ratio” of the synthesized flakes and thus we hypothesize that
viscosity might have a minimal effect. In future work, we aim to parametrize
and optimize our procedure in order to establish an overall synthetic
protocol that leads to predictable morphologies. Via this optimization,
we anticipate providing in the future, molecular-level understanding
as well as detailed mechanistic insights into the actual synthesis
steps.

Finally, it is worth mentioning here that a rather important,
not
trivial, benefit of the use of concentrated LiBr is highly related
with the scalability potential of the presented synthesis. The hydrolysis
of the precursors, that is, TTIP, leads to the release of significant
amount of isopropanol (IPA) that needs to be separated from the aqueous
mixture. However, the strong azeotrope between IPA and H2O could potentially hamper any attempt for scaling up and reusability
of both solvent(s) and salt system. The use of concentrated LiBr has
been reported to break the azeotrope and thus more than 99% IPA recovery
can be achieved,57 highlighting the possibility
of utilizing the MSH systems in reasonably scaled-up processes. To
that extent, future technoeconomic analysis of the synthesis process
will be beneficial in order to develop a holistic synthesis protocol
at a scaled-up level.

4 Conclusions
The manufacturing of TiO2 from titanium-containing ores
relies mainly on the sulfate and chloride processes which are energy
intensive as well as not environmentally friendly because they generate
large amount of acidic waste. Thus, the search for new, facile, and
scalable synthesis approaches to produce TiO2 is always
of topical character. The aspect of scalability becomes even more
challenging if one takes into account the need of tuning the morphology
and crystalline structure of TiO2, which in turn can control
the overall physicochemical properties of the synthesized material.
In this article, we present a method for the synthesis of titanium
dioxide with a high surface area and apparent mesoporous structure.
The large surface area arises from the small size of the TiO2 nanoparticles present in the larger aggregates, whereas the apparent
mesoporosity is from the intercrystalline space between those nanoparticles.
The synthesized materials present good thermal stability up to 400
°C. More specifically, the TiO2 material prepared
by using MSHs, such as molten LiBr hydrate solution, as reaction media
show a thin, flake-like morphology with a relatively large aspect
ratio. We find that the thickness of the prepared flakes depends primarily
on the LiBr/water molar ratio (always within the MSH regime). In all
cases, the primary crystalline phase of TiO2 is anatase
but small fraction of brookite has been also observed. In this work,
it is shown that the amount of brookite formed depends on both LiBr/H2O as well as LiBr/precursor molar ratio. We hypothesize that
the flake-like morphology arises from the fact that fast hydrolysis
and condensation takes place within the ordered structure of water
molecules in the MSH system.
