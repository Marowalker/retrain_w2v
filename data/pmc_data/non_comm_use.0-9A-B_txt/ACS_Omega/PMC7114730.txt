The molecular design and regulation
has shown bright future for
constructing smart molecular materials such as ferroelectrics, dielectric
switches, electro-optic effect, and so forth. Here, by poly-H/F substitution
in a simple organic-inorganic hybrid 2[CH2FCH2NH3]·[CdCl4], 1 (CH2FCH2NH3 = fluorine ethylamine cation), we obtained
two novel hybrids, namely, 2[CHF2CH2NH3]·[CdCl4], 2 (CHF2CH2NH3 = 2,2′-difluorine ethylamine cation)
and 2[CF3CH2NH3]·[CdCl4], 3 (CF3CH2NH3 = 2,2′,2″-trifluorine
ethylamine cation). Further investigations show that compounds 1, 2, and 3 experience solid reversible
phase transitions with temperatures at 294, 319, and 329 K respectively.
These unique phase transitions were confirmed by their remarkable
dielectric and heat anomalies around the phase transition temperatures.
X-ray single-crystal diffraction analyses before and after the phase
transitions show that the order–disorder motions of F atoms
and the twist motions from the 2D [CdCl4]2– framework lead to these solid reversible phase transitions. Also,
the Hirshfeld surface calculation of compounds 1, 2, and 3 suggests that the increasing ratio of
the F···F interaction from the intermolecular interaction
makes a major contribution for the substantial increase of their phase
transition temperatures.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Molecular
phase transitions materials are very popular in the recent
years because they exhibit a lot of special physical properties such
as ferroelectrics, switchable dielectrics, electro-optic effect, nonlinear
optic properties, and so forth.1−10 Especially, they show great advantages such as light weight, friendly
environment (not contain lead), structural flexibility, and easy synthesis
as compared with the traditional ceramic materials.11−17

Although much great progress has been made on the molecular
phase
transitions materials, there still exist a lot of difficulties on
how to obtain ideal molecular materials such as with high phase transitions
temperatures and excellent switchable dielectric properties from an
existing molecule. It is encouraging that scientists have recently
developed a few unique molecular phase transition materials where
their crystal structures, symmetry, band gap, and phase transition
temperatures can be controlled and tuned by regulating the host of
guest molecules.18−24 This special exploration much benefited to search the perfect performance
and further satisfied our update smart materials.23 Utilizing the idea of molecule design, modification, and
assembling, scientists can precisely construct their target products
from an existing molecular phase transition systems.4,23,25 For example, professor Xiong
et al. designed and synthesized a high Tc multiaxial molecular ferroelectric [3-oxoquinuclidinium]ClO4 by introducing directional hydrogen-bonding interactions
in [quinuclidinium]ClO4, and through this method, they
successfully reduced the symmetry from the cubic centrosymmetric Pm3̅m space group in [quinuclidinium]ClO4 to the orthorhombic polar Pna21 space group in [3-oxoquinuclidinium]ClO4.26 In addition, in our previous work, we have discovered
that the guest molecules and the anions play a great influence on
the nonferroelectric molecule phase transition system [Cu(1,10-phenothroline)2SeO4·(ethane-1,2-diol)]. With replacement
of ethane-1,2-diol by propanel-1,3-diol in such a system, the new
compound [Cu(1,10-phenothroline)2SeO4·(ethane-1,3-diol)]
possesses lower symmetry and becomes a new ferroelectric with high Tc 325 K.27 Another
significant case is that using the strategy of H/F substitution to
the organic–inorganic perovskite ferroelectric (pyrrolidinium)CdCl3 with a low Tc of 240 K,24 Xiong successfully explored two high Tc homochiral perovskite ferroelectrics, (R)- and (S)-3-F-(pyrrolidinium)CdCl3, of which Tc reaches 303 K, enhancing
63 K.23 Inspired by their previous outstanding
work, we are devoted to designing and constructing molecular phase
transition systems using polyfluorine amine as the building block
and analyzing the influence of the number of substituted fluorine
atoms on their physical properties including the structure symmetry,
band gap, phase transition temperatures, and so forth, and obtaining
the ideal phase transition materials.

Successfully, we developed
and investigated another new 2D hybrid
metal halide perovskite-type compound with a general formula of AMX4 (A = organic ammonium cation, M = divalent metal, X = chloride
ions) 2[CH2FCH2NH3]·[CdCl4], 1 (CH2FCH2NH3 = fluorine ethylamine cation) with reversible phase transition behaviors.
Further investigation shows that when 2-fluorine ethylamine were replaced
by 2,2′-difluorine ethylamine and 2,2′,2″-trifluorine
ethylamine, the phase transition temperatures of 2[CHF2CH2NH3]·[CdCl4], 2 (CHF2CH2NH3 = 2,2′-difluorine
ethylamine cation) and 2[CF3CH2NH3]·[CdCl4], 3 (CF3CH2NH3 = 2,2′,2″-trifluorine ethylamine cation)
are strikingly enhanced near 25 and 10 K, respectively. Here, we described
their interesting reversible phase transitions, switchable dielectrics,
crystal structures, and mechanism of increasing phase transition temperatures.

2 Results and Discussion
For most solid-state reversible
phase transitions, especially for
the first-order phase transitions, there usually exist remarkable
heat anomalies near the phase transition temperatures which include
the changes of entropy, enthalpy, specific heat capacity (Cp), and so forth.28 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) can
sensitively capture this information.29 As shown in Figure 1, one can clearly discover that a pair of endothermic/exothermic
peaks appear at 294.4/289.5 K for the heating/cooling runs for compound 1 (Figure 1a), while for compound 2, the endothermic/exothermic
peaks appear at 319.3/317.2 K, enhancing nearly by 25 K; then, the
same situation is also suitable for compound 3; it reaches
328.6/324.8 K for the heating/cooling runs and continues to improve
by 8 K. Such a significantly increase of reversible phase transition
temperatures indicates that the number of fluorine atoms has played
a crucial role in the reversible phase transition because the whole
body structures of 2D organic–inorganic hybrids always remained
unchanged. As a further step, we calculated their entropy changes
(ΔS) using the finite integration method (Supporting Information). Different from the common
reversible phase transitions, all of them possess ultra-large entropy
changes such as 28.5 J·mol–1·K–1 for compound 1, 38.698 J·mol–1·K–1 for compound 2, and 25.124
J·mol–1·K–1 for compound 3, so large entropy changes combined with the high phase-transition
temperatures suggests that it may be used as potential energy storage
materials. Subsequently, we calculated the N values
with 30.9/26.1 for 1, 105.1/68.783 for 2, and 20.531/20.522 for 3 according to the equation
ΔS = R ln N (Boltzmann equation), where R is the gas constant
and N represents the ratio of possible orientations
(Supporting Information). These large N values suggest that violent molecular motion possibly
exists in the phase transition processes. We judge that all the phase
transitions of 1, 2, and 3 belong
to the first-order phase transitions because the big thermal hysteresis
between the cooling and heating runs for 1, 2, and 3 are 5, 2, and 4 K, and in addition, they show
ultra-large N and entropy changes values.30 It should be emphasized that the decomposition
temperatures of compounds 1, 2, and 3 locate around 480, 510, and 450 K, respectively, according
to the TG–DTA (thermogravimetric analysis and differential
thermal analysis) curves (Figure S3), far
above those reversible phase transition temperatures.

Figure 1 Heat anomalies at (a)
294.4/289.5 K for compound 1, (b) 319.3/317.2 K for compound 2, and (c) 328.6/324.8
K for compound 3 during their heating/cooling runs.

Permittivity constant anomalies often accompany
with the solid-state
reversible phase transition behaviors and are also regarded as another
effective means to judge the phase transitions.31 The permittivity constant dependence on temperature under
frequency 1 MHz is shown in Figure 2a–c. Being highly consistent with that of heat
anomalies, the remarkable step-like permittivity constant changes
also arise around 290, 318, and 327 K for compounds 1, 2, and 3, respectively, suggesting that
the increasing number of fluorine atoms has played an important role
on the reversible phase transition temperatures of dielectric properties.
To further describe the dielectric anomalies at length, we take compound 1 as an example. As depicted in Figure 2a, a sudden increase of the permittivity
constant starts from 283 K (7.2 au) and ends around 292 K (11.2 au)
during the heating process (red line); after that, the permittivity
constant nearly remains unchanged and belongs to a higher dielectric
state, while for the cooling cycle (blue line), the permittivity constants
have fallen off a cliff from 285 K (11.0 au) to 281 K (7.3 au) and
then almost maintains the lower permittivity state. We have measured
the dielectric constant dependence on temperature for 10 cycles, and
the results always display the similar dielectric changes as the first
time except for a slight decrease of intensity. Compared with compounds 1 and 3, compound 2 displays the
most distinct changes of the permittivity constant around the phase
transition, in which the dielectric constants increase near 9 au between
the low dielectric state (14.5 au) and high dielectric state (23.5
au). Such significant changes of the permittivity constant are predicted
to have potential applications in the smart dielectric switches.32,33

2.1 Structural Difference between before and after
Phase Transitions
Most remarkable solid reversible phase
transitions also can be reflected by their distinct crystal structural
differences between before and after phase transitions. Subsequently,
we measured their crystal structures at selected temperatures (before
and after phase transitions). To be concise, we labeled the structures
of 1 before 290 K (phase transition temperature) 1-LTP, and after that, we named them 1-HTP. In
the similar fashion, we named the structures of 2 before
318 K (phase transition temperature) 2-LTP, and after
that, we called them 2-HTP. Subsequently, we called the
crystal structures of 3 before and after 327 K as 3-LTP and 3-HTP, respectively.

As depicted
in Table S1, 1-LTP belongs
to the monoclinic crystal system with the P21/c space group, while 1-HTP crystallizes
in the orthorhombic crystal system with the Cmce space
group. The P21/c space
group is part of C2h and
has four symmetrical elements, while Cmce belongs
to the D2h point group
and possess eight symmetrical elements. Also, the symmetry elements
decrease significantly from 8 (E, C2, C2′, C2′, i, σh, σv, σv) at 1-HTP to 4 (E, C2, i, σh) at 1-LTP. Such symmetry breaking has been frequently
reported in organic–inorganic hybrid phase transition materials
by other scientists.18 Furthermore, other
marked change such as the unit cell a-axis decreased
sharply from 11.2047(8) in 1-LTP to 7.4525(7) in 1-HTP, while the unit cell parameters b-axis
and cell volume V increased abruptly from 7.6515(5)
and 607.24(7) in 1-LTP to 21.842(2) and 1233.29(19) Å3 in 1-HTP, nearly reaching three and two times
of 1-LTP, respectively. While the c-axis
7.3050(5) in 1-LTP turn to 7.5766(6) Å3 in 1-HTP, almost remaining unchanged.

As shown
in Figure 3, whether
before or after the phase transition, both 1-HTP and 1-LTP have the same two dimensional organic–inorganic
A2BX4 perovskite structure (here, A is the protonated
fluorine ethylamine, B = Cd2+, X represents Cl–). All the cadmium atoms adopt the octahedral geometry which is linked
by six Cl– anions and forms an infinite linear [CdCl4]2– structure, and then further crossed
each other, resulting in the formation of a negative two-dimensional
inorganic sheet. The protonated fluorine ethylamine interspersed between
inorganic sheets by intermolecular hydrogen bonds and point charges,
packing to three-dimensional layer structures (Figure S4). Nevertheless, great differences can be discovered
between 1-HTP and 1-LTP. On the one hand,
fluorine ethylamine at high temperature (1-HTP) appears highly disordered which can be viewed as the twofold disorder
(Figure 3b), while
at low temperature (1-LTP), fluorine ethylamine
is completely ordered (Figure 3a); on the other hand, the co-ordination geometry of [CdCl6] in 1-HTP is a standard octahedron, while in 1-LTP, it is a seriously distorted one because the Cd–Cl
bond distance varied from 2.6743(2) Å in 1-HTP to
2.6574(15) Å and 2.6787(15) Å in 1-LTP. Simultaneously,
the 2-D [CdCl4]2– framework in 1-HTP displays a regular square with a side length 5.3486
Å (Figure 4b),
while in 1-LTP, it appears to be an irregular octagon
structure (Figure 4a), and the side lengths has changed to be 5.6950 and 4.9524 Å,
respectively, appearing to be seriously distorted (Figure 4). These apparent order–disorder
changes of fluorine ethylamine guest molecules and distortion of the
[CdCl4]2– framework also can be clearly
reflected by their packing diagrams in Figure S4a for 1-LTP and Figure S4b for 1-HTP.

hydrogen bonds and
fluorine atoms.

framework of 1-HTP.

Different from 1, both 2-LTP and 2-HTP belong to the same orthorhombic crystal system but with
different space groups, namely, Pbca and Cmce, respectively. Because they originate the same D2h point group with eight symmetrical
elements, no symmetry breaking occurs during phase transition. However,
there exist some significant crystallographic changes, for example,
the unit cell b and c [7.4027(9),
23.054(3)] in 2-LTP has exchanged to 23.412(2), 7.5566(7)
in 2-HTP (Table S2), and such
displacement indicates that a possible rotation movement was experienced
in phase transition. Similar to compound 1, 2-LTP and 2-HTP have two-dimensional organic–inorganic
A2BX4 perovskite structures.34 As shown in Figure 5a,b, at high temperature, C1, C2, F1, and F2 in 2,2′-difluorine
ethylamine are seriously disordered in 2-HTP, which can
be split as the twofold disorder (highlighted in Figure 5b), while all the atoms in 2-LTP are completely ordered (Figure 5a), showing an order–disorder motion
in the transition process. In addition, the coordination geometry
of [CdCl6] has also changed from slight octahedron in 2-HTP to a seriously distorted one in 2-LTP,
and the regular square 2-D [CdCl4]2– framework
in 2-HTP has turned into an irregular distorted structure
because the side length between Cl···Cl atoms have
been changed from the unified 5.3465 Å in 2-HTP to
6.0599 and 4.5924 Å in 2-LTP (Figure 6). These clear changes suggest that both
the order–disorder motion of F atoms and the twist motion from
[CdCl4]2– frameworks lead to its solid
reversible phase transition which can be also reflected by the packing
diagram of 2-LTP (Figure S5a) and 2-HTP (Figure S5b).17,29

framework of 2-LTP and (b) regular square
framework of 2-HTP.

As a further step, when we replaced 2-fluorine ethylamine by 2,2′,2″-trifluorine
ethylamine, compound 3 undergoes a higher reversible
phase transition temperature (329 K) than that of compound 2. As listed in Table S3, both 3-LTP and 3-HTP crystallized in the same symmetrical crystal
system monoclinic but with different space groups, where 3-LTP belongs to C2/c and 3-HTP is the P21/c space
group. They have the same C2h point group with four symmetrical elements (E, C2, i, and σh), and no symmetry breaking happened in the
phase transition too. Nevertheless, some distinct changes can be also
easily discovered between 3-LTP and 3-HTP. According to the crystallographic Table S3, the most remarkable changes between 3-LTP and 3-HTP is that the unit cell length a and
cell volume V have increased from 13.603(4) Å
and 718.4(5) Å3 in 3-HTP to 25.831(6)
Å and 1390.6(6) Å3 in 3-LTP, which
is nearly a doubled increase. Another striking change is that the
β angle has changed from 105.740(16) in 3-HTP to
90.462(5) in 3-LTP, showing that a significant twist
motion occurs in the phase transition (Table S3).

As further depicted in Figure 7a,b, one can discover that all the fluorine
and nitrogen
atoms, especially F1 atoms in 3-HTP, are obviously more
disordered than those in 3-LTP, exhibiting the characteristics
of order–disorder type phase transition. In addition, a slightly
distorted motion can be discovered from the 2-D [CdCl4]2– framework between 3-LTP and 3-HTP, such as the Cd–Cl–Cd angles has changed from 152.914
to 154.087°(Figures S6 and S7). What
is more, when viewed from the b-axis direction, large
deviation angles have been slipped between the neighbor layers along
the a-axis direction between 3-HTP (Figure 7b) and 3-LTP (Figure 7a), according
to their packing diagrams. This larger shift also affords a crucial
interpretation for the space group transformed from C2/c in 3-LTP to P21/c in 3-HTP.

Figure 7 Molecular structure of
(a) 3-LTP and (b) 3-HTP.

Based on the analysis of above results, it can be seen that
when
we replaced fluorine ethylamine with 2,2′-difluorine ethylamine,
the space group changed from P21/c in 1-LTP to Pbca in 2-LTP, and then, when 2,2′-difluorine ethylamine was
further replaced by 2,2′,2″ trifluorine ethylamine,
the space group decreased from Pbca to C2/c in 3-LTP, showing that the symmetry
of the guest molecule have an important influence on the space group
of our product compounds.35 In addition,
with increasing number of fluorine in guest molecules, the reversible
phase transition temperatures are improved from 294 K in compound 1, to 319 K in compound 2, then to 328 K in compound 3, and such substantial increases indicate that the fluorine
atoms may play a crucial role for the intermolecular interactions
(Figure 8).

of (a) 3-LTP and (b) 3-HTP viewed along
the b-axis.

Once again, the variable-temperature powder X-ray diffractometry
(PXRD) patterns of title compounds further confirmed their interesting
solid reversible phase transitions. Take compound 2 (Tc = 319.3 K) as an example, in comparison with
those at 298.15 K, we can easily observe that two Bragg diffraction
peaks at ∼33.1° and another one at ∼43.2°
vanished when the temperature is higher than that at 319.3 K and then
appeared again when it was cool down to 298.15 K. (As shown in Figure 9.)

Figure 9 Variable-temperature
PXRD patterns of 2.

To deeply disclose the mechanism for the gradual decrease of reversible
phase transition temperatures among compounds 1, 2, and 3, we analyze their near-interaction forces
for crystal structures by Hirshfeld surface calculation.36−38 This calculation is based on the definition of accessibility and
affords important information of intermolecular interaction with the
aid of CrystalExplorer software.38 Consequently,
we import the crystal structures of compounds 1, 2, and 3 into CrystalExplorer software and analyze
the Hirshfeld surface result. The dnorm surface picture and the exploded view of the fingerprint for 1-LTP, 2-LTP, and 3-LTP were depicted
in Figures S8–S10. Obviously, the
ratios of F···H/H···F, F···Cl
interactions occupy the 30.2%, 0.4% of the total hirshfeld surface
for compound 1, while the percentages of F···H/H···F
and F···Cl/Cl···F interactions for compound 2 are 42.4, 2.0%, and for compound 3 are 19.5
and 3.5%, respectively. Obviously, the F···Cl/Cl···F
interactions gradually increased with the increasing of fluorine atoms,
especially, as shown in Figure 9 which represents the ratio of F···F interaction
of 2D fingerprint plots in compound 1, 2, and 3. These results suggest that the ratio of the
F···F interaction quickly improves from 0.5% for 1 (Figure 10a) to 8.1% for 2 (Figure 10b) to 37.0% for 3 (Figure 10c), with the increase
of fluorine atoms, and it exerts the primary role for intermolecular
interactions.39 In combination of their
crystal structures analysis, we can attentively infer that compound 3 needs to overcome more energy for the reversible phase transition
contributes to the enhancement of F···F interaction,
so it should undergo the highest temperature phase transition among
the three compounds, and such work has been addressed by Wolters and
Bickelhaupt.39 According to the abovementioned
results and the recent work reported by Xiong et al.,23 we roughly proposed the following explanation for the improving
phase transition temperatures with the increase of fluorine atoms.
On the one hand, the barrier of rotation of the fluorinated organic
molecules is raised, resulting in a remarkable increase in Tc.23 On the other
hand, the van der Waals forces including the dispersion force, induction
force, and orientation force are improved, leading to the synergistic
increase in Tc.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, by poly-H/F substitution in the new organic-inorganic
hybrid 2[CH2FCH2NH3]·[CdCl4], 1, we obtained two new hybrids, 2[CHF2CH2NH3]·[CdCl4], 2 and 2[CF3CH2NH3]·[CdCl4], 3, with higher reversible phase transition
temperatures. This research suggests that the poly-H/F substitution
exerts the primary role on the crystal structures and phase transition
behaviors. We believe such investigation will pave a new way for searching
the multifunctional materials such as dielectric switches.

4.2 Singe-Crystal Structure Determination
We
measured the single crystal X-ray diffraction of compounds 1, 2, and 3 on a D8 QUEST (Bruker)
diffractometer using the Cu Kα radiation. According to the DSC
results, we collected the data by θ–2θ scanning
before and after their phase transition temperatures and then corrected
via Lp absorption. Their structures were
solved using the direct method using OLEX-2 software package. All
H atoms were located from difference Fourier maps and refined with
isotropic temperature parameters. The crystallographic information
of compounds 1, 2, and 3 has
been deposited in the CIF format in the Cambridge Crystallographic
Database Centre, as given in the Supporting Information, CCDC 1964748 for 1-LTP, 1964749 for 1-HTP, 1964750 for 2-LTP, 1964751 for 2-HTP, 1964757 for 3-LTP, and 1964755 for 3-HTP. Crystallographic data and structure refinements of
compounds at different temperatures for compounds 1, 2, and 3 are given in Tables S1–S3, respectively.

4.3 DSC and
Thermogravimetric Analysis
We measured the thermal properties
of compounds 1, 2, and 3 by
DSC using a TA Q2000 DSC instrument.
The DSC were recorded both on cooling and heating runs, and the powdered
samples were determined at the rate of temperature changes of 10 K/min.
The indium standard was used for the temperature and enthalpy calibration.
As a further step, thermogravimetric analysis measurement was performed
on a TA Instruments STD2960 system from room temperature to 700 K
in the nitrogen atmosphere at a rate of 10 K/min (Figure S3).

4.4 Dielectric Property
Dielectric measurements
were carried out with powder samples in the form of tablets which
were used as electrodes by coating silver conduction on both of its
surfaces compactly. The dielectric constant dependence on temperatures
of title compounds was confirmed with an Agilent or a model TH2828A
impedance analyzer under the frequency 1 MHz in the process of heating
and then cooling. The temperatures were controlled within the range
of 270–420 K.
