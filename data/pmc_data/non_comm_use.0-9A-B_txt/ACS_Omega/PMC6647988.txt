Multistep activation
of a Canadian oilsands petroleum coke that
yields an acidified mesoporous carbon catalyst is reported. Microporous-activated
carbon (APC; ∼2000 m2/g), obtained by thermochemical
activation of petroleum coke using KOH, was impregnated with ammonium
heptamolybdate and activated by carbothermal hydrogen reduction (CHR).
The resulting Mo2C, supported on high-mesopore volume (Vmeso ∼0.4 cm3/g) carbon, yields
the desired mesoporous carbon catalyst (Vmeso ∼0.7 cm3/g) following acid washing. The effect
of CHR temperature and the benefit of Mo2C loading on mesopore
development is reported, and pore development models are discussed.
The mesoporous carbons are active for the esterification of acetic
acid and 1-butanol at 77 °C, and the butanol conversion correlates
with the catalyst acidity, as measured by NH3-TPD.

1 Introduction
Bio-oil,
as a renewable energy source with the potential to replace
some fossil fuels, is one of the most promising products of biomass
conversion.1,2 However, the properties of bio-oil prevent
its direct use in engine combustion. The high oxygen content (35–40%),
low heating value, high acidity, and excessive water content also
mean that the bio-oil is unstable during storage. There are several
technologies that address these problems, and esterification is one
cost effective method that can be used to stabilize bio-oil.3 Esterification reduces the polarity of the bio-oil
while generating water, and this contributes to an oil–water
phase separation and the removal of most of the water from the bio-oil.4,5

Esterification reactions are usually catalyzed by homogenous
acid
catalysts. Despite their high activity and low cost, the environmental
impact of waste acid treatment, combined with a difficult catalyst/product
separation, means that alternative solid acid catalysts are of interest.6,7 Low-cost carbon materials, derived from activated petroleum coke
(petcoke) and acidified, have been proposed as potential acid catalysts
for esterification.6,7

Thermochemical treatment
of nonporous petcoke8 is used to generate
pores and surface area at relatively
low activation temperatures (450–900 °C) and short activation
times.9 The activated petcoke may have
O functional groups present on the surface, depending on the activation
conditions. The O functional groups decrease the hydrophobicity of
the carbon surface, improving impregnation from aqueous solution when
preparing supported metal catalysts.10 Furthermore,
the functional groups can act as nucleation centers for metallic crystallites,
leading to high metal dispersions.11,12 These properties
suggest the possibility of metal impregnation of activated petcoke
to yield highly dispersed metals on the carbon that can then be used
in catalytic gasification to generate mesoporous carbons. The catalytic
activation of carbonaceous precursors by metals involves reactions
similar to those that occur in the catalytic gasification of coal
or other carbon-based materials.13,14 Transition
metals, such as Ni, Fe, and Cr, are usually applied in coal and carbon
gasification processes.15,16 However, the aim of
catalytic activation is to stop the reaction once a high surface area
or pore volume is obtained, without gasifying all of the carbon. As
noted by Wu et al.,16 Ni and Cr, initially
present in petcoke, can act as catalysts to facilitate activation
and pore development. Tomita et al.17 reported
that the presence of Ni accelerates the steam gasification of coal
mainly by pitting. Metal sites on the carbon act as active sites for
the reaction between C and H2O or CO2. To produce
mesopores, the required activation temperature is relatively high,
and consequently the carbon yield is low.18,19 Recently, the use of carbothermal hydrogen reduction (CHR) to synthesize
Mo2C catalysts supported on carbon20 was shown to also significantly enhance the mesoporosity of the
carbon support.21

Porous carbon can
be functionalized by acid treatment to yield
acid catalysts22,23 or surface-functionalized materials.24 Acid treatment by H2SO4 or HNO3 is common,24−27 and after acid treatment, the carbon can be used
as a catalyst support with high concentration of O functional groups
that improve the metal dispersion.27 They
can also be used directly in esterification reactions as acid catalysts.
Liu et al.28 reported that −SO3H-functionalized carbon showed good activity for the esterification
of oleic acid and methanol compared with Amberlyst-15. Carbon-based
solid acid catalysts were also used by Shu et al.29 to convert vegetable oil to fatty acids via hydrolysis.

The aim of the present study is to transform Canadian oilsands
petcoke into a valuable mesoporous carbon with sufficient surface
acidity so as to be able to act as an esterification catalyst. A multistep
approach was used in which thermochemical activation of the petcoke
with KOH was followed by impregnation with ammonium heptamolybdate
prior to carbothermal hydrogen reduction (CHR). An acid wash was then
used to reduce the Mo content of the carbon and acidify the catalyst
surface. The impact of both the Mo loading and the CHR temperature
on the carbon porosity is reported, and the benefit of using Mo2C in the preparation of the acidified mesoporous carbon is
demonstrated. Finally, the catalytic activities of the acidified mesoporous
carbons, derived from Mo2C/APC and APC alone, assessed
using acetic acid and 1-butanol as model reactants for esterification,
are compared.

2 Results
The properties
of the activated petcoke (APC_800) and the acid-washed
APC_800 are summarized in Table 1, together with the acidity (NH3 uptake)
and esterification activity of both materials. From these data, one
concludes that the APC_800 is microporous with minimal acidity and
esterification activity. However, the Raman data (Table 1 and Figure S1) show that the APC_800 has more disorder (i.e., is more
amorphous) than the raw petcoke. Following the acid wash, both the
mesoporosity (Figure S3) and the acidity
of the carbon increased significantly and there was a corresponding
increase in the esterification activity of the acid-washed APC_800
(i.e., Acid-T APC_800).

The impact
of utilizing CHR and the synthesis of Mo2C to impact the
properties of the activated petcoke (APC_800) are
shown in the property data of Mo2C/APC, prepared at different
Mo loadings and CHR temperatures, as summarized in the 3D plots of Figure 1, with the data values
of the AHM/APC precursors and Mo2C/APC provided in Table S2 (Supporting Information). Previously,
the effect of CHR temperature at a Mo loading of 10 wt % was reported21 whereas the data reported herein provides information
on the interacting effects of Mo loading and CHR temperature on the
Mo2C synthesis and textural properties of the carbon. The
data of Figure 1 show
that both surface area and total pore volume of the Mo2C/APC generally decreased with increased Mo loading, regardless of
the CHR temperature (Figure 1a,b). A maximum value occurred at a reduction temperature
between 800 and 900 °C at a low Mo loading (≤2 wt %).
The highest surface area was obtained for the 0.5Mo2C/APC_R900
sample. Once the reduction temperature reached 700 °C, the surface
area remained relatively high (>1800 m2/g) with the
Mo
loading ≤2 wt %.

Figure 1 Three-dimensional plot of physical properties
of Mo2C/APC samples with various Mo loadings and CHR temperatures:
(a)
surface area; (b) total pore volume (Vtotal); (c) mesopore volume (Vmeso).

Figure 1c shows
that the mesopore volume increased with increased CHR temperature
at each Mo loading, provided the CHR was conducted at 500–900
°C. Above 900 °C, the mesopore volume decreased. The maximum
mesopore volume occurred for the 1Mo2C/APC_R900 sample.
The data of Table S2 show a significant
increase in mesopore volume for all Mo2C/APC samples compared
to their corresponding precursors. The change in textural properties
of the Mo2C/APC is a result of the hydrogenation of carbon,
yielding mostly CH4 during CHR. The GC-FID results showing
the CH4 concentration profiles during CHR of the 2Mo2C/APC_R700, 5Mo2C/APC_R700, and 10Mo2C/APC_R700 samples are reported in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). The CH4 concentration in the
CHR product gas increased as the CHR temperature increased, but then
it decreased once the final temperature was reached. Also, a higher
Mo loading resulted in increased carbon hydrogenation, as reflected
in the higher CH4 concentration in the CHR product gas.

Finally, the average particle size of the Mo2C present
on the Mo2C/APC after CHR is reported in Table 2, on the basis of the log-normal
distribution applied to the TEM particle size measurements. The data
show that increased Mo loading and/or increased CHR temperature increased
the average Mo2C size of the Mo2C/APC samples.

The physical properties of the acid-treated
Mo2C/APC
samples are compared to the data of the Mo2C/APC prior
to acid treatment in Tables 3 and 4. The data show that the acid
wash resulted in 50–70% Mo removal from the catalysts and there
was no significant change in surface area after the acid treatment,
except for the 2Mo2C/APC_R900 sample. Generally, the mesopore
volume increased after acid treatment for all samples, presumably
due to the removal of Mo by the acid. The acid-treated sample Acid
T-1Mo2C/APC_R900 had the highest Vmeso (0.70 cm3/g) and VTotal (1.59 cm3/g).

Tables 3 and 4 also summarize the NH3-TPD results of
the Mo2C/APC and acid-treated Mo2C/APC samples.
As expected, the acid-treated Mo2C/APC samples had significantly
higher acidity in all cases except for the Acid-T 2Mo2C/APC_R900
sample. The Acid-T 1Mo2C/APC_R900 sample had the highest
number of acid sites (1942 μmol/g).

1-Butanol and acetic
acid were chosen as model reactants to determine
the esterification activity of the prepared catalysts. The sole product
of the reaction is butyl acetate, and the selectivity was >99 wt
%
for all tests reported herein. The results of the activity tests at
77 °C for the APC_800 and acid-treated APC_800 are reported in Table 1, and the Mo2C/APC and acid-treated Mo2C/APC catalysts are compared
in Tables 3 and 4. All acid-treated catalysts showed significantly
higher conversion than the untreated samples, whereas the acid-treated
Mo2C/APC catalysts with a Mo loading ≤1 wt % had
higher activity than that of the acid-treated APC_800 (without Mo).
The Acid-T 1Mo2C/APC_R900 catalyst had the highest conversion
among all samples tested with 52.6% 1-butanol conversion after 2 h
of reaction. The estimated second-order kinetic rate constants (k), plotted against the number of acid sites as determined
by NH3-TPD for both the Mo2C/APC and Acid-T
Mo2C/APC catalysts, are shown in Figure 2. For all Mo2C/APC catalysts without
acid treatment, the kinetic constants are approximately constant (4.9
± 0.5) × 10–9 m3·(mol·s)−1, independent of the Mo2C loading on the
APC. The difference in number of acid sites on these catalysts is
relatively small such that the impact on the reaction rate is not
evident. However, for the Acid-T Mo2C/APC catalysts, the
kinetic constants clearly increase with the number of acid sites present
on the catalyst.

3 Discussion
The data of Table 1 show that the activated petcoke is readily
converted to an acid
catalyst with significant esterification activity following acid washing
with fuming H2SO4. Compared to the APC_800 sample,
the acid treatment (Acid-T APC_800) increased the porosity of the
activated petcoke and generated acid sites on the carbon. The data
of Tables 3 and 4 show, however, that the synthesis of Mo2C yields Mo2C/APC catalysts with significantly higher
porosity, acidity and esterification activity after acid treatment
when compared to the Acid-T APC_800 (i.e., with no Mo2C).

The textural properties of the Mo2C/APC (Figure 1 and Table S2) reflect the pore enlargement that occurred during the CHR
process. As shown in Figures S4 and S5 (Supporting
Information), the pore size distributions, calculated using NLDFT,
show a shift from micropores to mesopores after CHR up to a temperature
of 900 °C. These data indicate that the micropores are being
widened into mesopores during CHR. At a CHR temperature of 1000 °C,
an increase in surface area was observed, indicative of new pores
being generated, possibly by pore lengthening. The shape of the isotherms
suggest slit-like structures according to the study of Wigmans.30 A small loss in mesopore volume also occurred
at 1000 °C due to the high burn-off at this temperature. Hence,
two modes of pore development occur during CHR: (i) enlargement of
existing pores and (ii) generation of new pores. The widening of an
existing pore results in the replacement of the micropore volume with
mesopore volume, without significantly increasing surface area. The
generation of new pores results in increased surface area, micropore
volume and mesopore volume. The latter mode of pore growth, known
as channeling, is mainly due to the high crystallinity of graphite,18,31 with the size of the resulting pores determined by the particle
size of the metal catalyst.31,32 Note that the data
of Table S3 show that the same CHR treatment
up to 800 °C carried out with the Mo species loaded onto the
raw (low surface area) petcoke rather than the APC, did not result
in significant increases in surface area or pore volume. This reflects
the limited ability of the Mo species to create new pores at the lower
CHR temperatures, without some initial porosity generated by the KOH
treatment. The Raman data reported in Table 1 show an increase in the I(D)/I(G) band intensity ratio after KOH activation,
indicative of an increase in disordered (amorphous) carbon formation
following activation. Hence, carbon associated with the pore walls
activated during the KOH treatment will be less crystalline and more
reactive than the carbon associated with the original petcoke that
was not activated by the KOH. Consequently, in the initial stage of
the catalytic hydrogenation at lower reaction temperatures, amorphous
carbon associated with the pore walls is hydrogenated, resulting in
the widening of pores. As the amorphous carbon is removed, pore lengthening
will also occur as the less reactive, crystalline carbon is hydrogenated
at higher temperature. The physical properties of Mo2C/APC
generated at temperatures below 900 °C, reflect the pore enlargement
that occurred during the CHR by widening of the micropores present
in the APC, rather than through the development of new pores.

The data trends in Figure 1 and Table S2 are consistent with
the two pore development modes operating at different temperatures
especially at lower Mo loading (≤2 wt %). The hydrogenation
of amorphous carbon appears to dominate the pore growth mechanism
at lower temperatures (≤900 °C). From 700 to 900 °C,
it can be seen that the mesopore volume steadily increased with a
small loss in surface area and micropore volume for the catalysts
with 1 and 2 wt % Mo. The increase in mesopore volume and loss in
micropore volume can be explained by the width of pores. Merging of
two pores when the wall between them is too thin will result in a
loss of surface area. After the amorphous carbon is consumed at lower
temperatures, the Mo species react with the highly crystallized carbon.
At 1000 °C, surface area and micropore volume increased with
loss of mesopore volume as pore lengthening dominates. The loss of
mesopores is due to the collapse of pore walls and the loss of the
outer surface of the carbon particles at higher temperature. It can
be concluded that for the 1 and 2 wt % Mo loading catalysts, the dominating
pore development mechanism shifted from widening to lengthening due
to the increase in reduction temperature. A diagram of pore development
of Mo2C/APC with different Mo loadings and CHR temperatures
is illustrated in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Diagram of pore development process of AHM/APC precursors with
different Mo loadings and CHR temperatures.

The detailed mechanism of Mo2C generation during
CHR
has been described elsewhere21 for the
case of 10 wt % Mo loading; whereas, in the present study, different
Mo loadings and CHR temperatures were investigated to better understand
the generation of the mesoporous carbon. The average Mo2C particle size, as measured by TEM, increased with increased loading
at the same CHR temperature. The phenomenon is common to supported
catalysts - at low loading the Mo is well dispersed; whereas, at high
loading the proximity of particles on the carbon surface can result
in aggregation of smaller particles. Consequently, some of the Mo2C or MoOxCy particles grow into larger particles. At high temperature
(1000 °C), the Mo2C or MoOxCy become much more mobile on the support
surface and there is a higher chance that two or more adjacent particles
aggregate upon contact. Alternatively, as the Mo2C or MoOxCy species consume
the carbon support adjacent to the particle during CHR, the particles
may contact each other and hence aggregate. Moreover, the consumption
of the carbon is determined by the overall contact area between the
Mo species and carbon support. For example, total carbon loss per
gram of Mo for the 1Mo2C/APC_R800 sample (∼40 gC/gMo)
with a Mo2C particle size of 9.4 nm (Table 2) is about 5 times that of the 10Mo2C/APC_R800 sample (7.5 gC/gMo) with a particle size of 10.8 nm and
the former has ≥10 times the mesopore volume generated on a
per gram of Mo basis (calculation details are provided in the Supporting
Information). The larger the Mo2C particle size, the lower
the overall Mo/carbon contact area, resulting in less efficient pore
generation by the Mo. Large particles also create larger pores which
have a higher likelihood of collapse with loss of surface area.

The catalysts with low Mo loading (≤2 wt % Mo) and prepared
at CHR temperatures ≥900 °C were selected for acid treatment
and the esterification reaction since at higher Mo loading the pore
generation efficiency was lower and the resulting materials had fragile
pore walls; whereas, at lower CHR temperatures the mesopore volume
of the catalyst was relatively low (and similar to that obtained without
the Mo – see the Acid-T APC_800). As summarized in Tables 3 and 4, acidity was present in both the Mo2C/APC catalysts
and the acid-treated catalysts. Although part of the acidity may come
from Mo2C or MoOxCy, the low Mo content indicates that the majority
of the acid sites result from functionalization of the carbon support.
The Raman spectroscopy (Figure S1) and
CHNS analysis (Table S4) confirmed that
the carbon surface of the APC_800 is functionalized by O that is known
to generate acid sites, as has been reported for graphene oxide.33,34 In addition, during activation by CHR, defect sites form on the
carbon surface as CH4 is generated and these sites can
combine with oxygen during passivation. Hence, with increased Mo loading,
more defect sites will form, resulting in an increase in acid sites
(Tables 3 and 4). From the esterification results we conclude that
without acid treatment, the esterification ability of the Mo2C/APC is relatively low, but after acid treatment the catalysts have
esterification activity comparable to traditional solid acid catalysts
operated at similar temperature. For example, the second-order rate
constants (k) of the 1Mo2C/APC_R900 and
the Acid-T 1Mo2C/APC_R900 measured at 77 °C were 0.5
× 10–8 m3·(mol·s)−1 and 2.3 × 10–8 m3·(mol·s)−1, respectively. These values
compare favorably with the ion-exchange catalysts reported by Peters
et al.35 for the same reaction operated
at 75 °C. Analyzing their data35 using
the same methodology as for the Mo2C/APC catalysts (see Section 5.4), values of
2.1 × 10–8 m3·(mol·s)−1 and 2.7 × 10–8 m3·(mol·s)−1 for Amberlyst-15 and Smopex-101
catalysts, were obtained, respectively.

After acid treatment,
the textural properties of catalysts were
significantly improved (Tables 1, 3, and 4).
Comparing the APC_800 and acid-treated APC_800 shows that the acid
treatment resulted in increased porosity and acidity of the carbon.
The acid treatment also removed >50% of Mo from the pores of the
Mo2C/APC samples, further increasing the mesoporosity of
the
catalyst. More importantly, the acid treatment introduces oxygen functional
groups such as -SO3H and -COOH onto the catalyst surface.22,23 The increase in S content of the Acid-T APC_800 compared to the
APC_800 sample (Table S5) indicates the
presence of -SO3H. However, with a S content of only 0.2
wt % on the Acid-T APC_800 sample, the corresponding -SO3H content of the catalyst is approximately 63 μmol/g. Since
this is significantly lower than the acidity determined from NH3 TPD (Table 1), we conclude that most of acidity arises from other oxygen functional
groups on the acid-treated carbon surface, such as −COOH. Consequently,
most of the acid-washed catalysts had higher acidity and higher esterification
activity per gram of catalyst than the corresponding Mo2C/APC. In one case, the 2Mo2C/APC_R900 catalyst loses
significant surface area after the acid treatment, presumably due
to loss of pore walls. As Figure 3 shows, the second-order rate constant increased with
increased acidity of the acid-treated Mo2C/APC catalysts.
Assuming that the NH3 uptake is a measure of the number
of active sites of the acid-treated catalysts, the turnover frequency
(TOF) was calculated for each catalyst and is reported in Tables 1, 3, and 4. We note that the acid-treated
catalysts have similar TOFs, as expected from Figure 2 that shows an approximate linear increase
in the second-order rate constant with NH3 uptake. Hence,
we conclude that the same type of acid sites (-SO3H and
-COOH) are mostly responsible for the esterification reaction on all
acid-washed catalysts. For the nonacid-washed Mo2C/APC
catalysts, the NH3 uptake was significantly lower than
that for the acid-treated catalysts. The NH3 must titrate
acid sites associated not with the acid washing (-SO3H
or -COOH acid sites) but rather those associated with O species of
the Mo2C and the activated carbon.36 The NH3 uptake increased with increased Mo2C content, and the corresponding TOF of the nonacid-washed Mo2C/APC catalysts generally decreased as the Mo2C
loading increased. In this case, many factors may impact the calculated
TOF, including a change in the type of sites as the Mo loading increased,
increased mesoporosity, and lower Mo2C dispersion. Hence,
the TOFs of the nonacid-treated samples cannot be compared directly
to those of the acid-treated samples nor can they be compared directly
to one another since the type of acid site is changing (Mo oxycarbide
versus O functional group on the carbon), the Mo2C dispersion
is decreasing, and the internal mass transfer to the acid sites is
increasing as the Mo loading increases. The Acid-T 1Mo2C/APC_R900 had the highest acidity among all catalysts and had about
two times higher activity than that of the acid-treated APC_800 catalyst
(with no Mo) and the Mo2C/APC catalyst that were not acid-washed.

4 Conclusions
High-surface area microporous carbons (APC)
were prepared from
a Canadian oilsands-derived petcoke by thermochemical activation at
800 °C in the presence of KOH. The subsequent impregnation of
the APC with ammonium heptamolybdate and activation by carbothermal
hydrogen reduction yields Mo2C supported on a mesoporous
carbon with a high mesopore volume (Vmeso ∼0.4 cm3/g). Mesoporous carbons (Vmeso ∼0.7 cm3/g) were subsequently obtained
by acid washing. Both CHR temperature and Mo loading impact the textural
properties of the carbons. Acid treatment significantly improves the
catalyst activity for all catalysts. The esterification activity of
the acid-washed Mo2C/APC catalysts was significantly higher
than that of the APC without the Mo. The acid-washed Mo2C/APC prepared with low Mo loading and CHR temperature up to 900
°C yields acidic mesoporous carbon with the highest mesoporosity,
acidity, and catalyst esterification activity.

5 Experimental
Section
5.1 Raw Materials
Petroleum coke (PC)
recovered from a delayed coker was provided by Suncor Energy Inc.
The PC was ground and sieved to 90–180 μm and then dried
overnight at 110 °C before use. The ultimate analysis of the
received material is reported in Table S1 (Supporting Information). Ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate (AHM;
(NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O) was used as the Mo precursor. The reactants 1-butanol (Aldrich,
99.9%) and acetic acid (Aldrich, 99%) were used as received for the
esterification reaction.

5.2 Preparation of APC, AHM/APC,
and Mo2C/APC
About 3.5 g of the raw petcoke (BET
area: ∼3
m2/g and pore volume: ∼0.01 cm3/g)37 was dry mixed with KOH in a KOH/petcoke mass
ratio of 3:1 and activated in a N2 flow (200 mL(STP)/min)
while heating in a tube furnace at a ramp rate of 5 °C/min to
the final temperature of 800 °C and then holding this temperature
for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, the sample was washed
with 1 M HCl solution to remove excess KOH and then dried at 110 °C
for 8 h. The obtained activated petcoke was designated as APC_800.

The APC_800 sample was then wet-impregnated with ammonium heptamolybdate
(AHM) prepared in a 1:9 mass ratio of acetone and deionized water.
For lower Mo loadings (≤2 wt %), ca. 3.5 mLsolution/gAPC was used for the wet impregnation and for higher
Mo loadings (>2.0 wt %), 5.0 mLsolution/gAPC was used for the impregnation. After impregnation, the samples were
stabilized at room temperature for 3–4 h prior to drying at
110 °C overnight. The AHM/APC precursors were then carbothermally
reduced under continuous H2 flow (100 mL(STP)/min) at a
designated temperature in a fixed-bed quartz microreactor to convert
the AHM to Mo2C.38 The temperature
was increased from room temperature to the final temperature (600–1100
°C) at a ramp rate of 1 °C/min. The final temperature was
held for a further 90 min before switching to a N2 flow
(50 mL(STP)/min) and quenching the sample to room temperature. A GC-FID
was connected to the outlet of the CHR microreactor to quantify the
CH4 produced during the CHR process. The acquired samples
were named as xxMo2C/APC_Ryyy, where xx represents the
Mo loading and yyy is the final reduction temperature (°C) of
the CHR.

Several samples were subsequently acid-washed to remove
Mo. Accordingly,
10 mL of fuming sulfuric acid (50 wt % SO3) was placed
in a 50 mL round bottom flask and heated to 80 °C using a heating
mantle. The selected Mo2C/APC sample (0.5 g) was added
to the flask and reacted at 80 °C for 4 h under reflux and mixing
using a magnetic stirrer. After cooling to room temperature, the acquired
mixture was diluted with distilled water. The solid was recovered
by filtration after washing with distilled water and dried in an oven
for 12 h before use. The collected samples are identified as Acid-T
xxMo2C/APC_Ryyy. An acid wash of the APC_800 (without Mo2C) was done similarly to determine the impact of Mo on the
acid-treated carbon catalysts.

The carbon loss during the CHR
process is defined as 1  where mAHM is
the initial mass of AHM/APC precursor and mMo2C is the final mass of the Mo2C/APC catalyst.
The final yield of Mo2C/APC was calculated as follows 2  

5.3 Characterization
of APC, Mo2C/APC,
and Acid-Treated Mo2C/APC
N2 physisorption
isotherms of the prepared samples were measured at −196 °C
using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer to determine surface area,
pore volume, and pore size distribution. Prior to the analysis, ∼0.1
g of the sample was degassed at 200 °C (100 mm Hg) for 4 h. The
pore size distribution was calculated by the nonlocal density functional
theory (NLDFT) based on a N2 DFT model assuming a pore
slit geometry, which is common for carbon materials. The surface area
was calculated from the adsorption isotherm in the relative pressure
range (p/po) of 0.01–0.30
using the 2D-NLDFT method. The pore volumes were obtained using the
2D-NLDFT method as well.

The particle size of Mo2C on Mo2C/APC was determined from transmission electron
microscopy analysis (TEM, FEI Tecnai Osiris operated at 200 kV with
a resolution limit of 1.4 Å). The presence of certain crystal
phases was confirmed by d-spacing measurement. The samples were ground
to a fine powder and dispersed in ethanol by sonication. One or two
drops of the suspension were placed on a 300-mesh lacey carbon film.
The TEM images were analyzed and >100 particles measured to determine
a particle size distribution that was fitted to a log-normal distribution
from which the average size of the metal clusters/particles was estimated.

The ultimate analysis of petcoke was conducted in an elemental
analyzer (Perkin-Elmer 2400 series II CHNS/O) at a combustion temperature
of 975 °C. Elemental analysis of the samples was conducted by
inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES).
All samples were acid-digested in aqua regia at 110 °C to extract
the metals from the support prior to the analysis. Ammonium temperature-programmed
desorption (NH3-TPD) was used to determine the acidity
of both Mo2C/APC and the corresponding acid-treated samples.
The NH3 desorption was measured using the TCD detector
of a Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 unit. The sample was treated in 15
vol % NH3 under a He flow of 50 mL(STP)/min at 70 °C
for 60 min, followed by flushing in pure He for 2 h at the same temperature
to remove physisorbed NH3 species. The TPD signal was collected
as the sample was subsequently heated under the same He flow from
100 to 550 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min, holding the final
temperature of 550 °C for 30 min.

Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRAM
HR800 operated at a laser power of 10
mW, a grating of 1800 g/m, resolution of 0.65 cm–1, and laser wave length of 532 nm were used for Raman analysis of
the carbons. The samples were analyzed without any pretreatment. The
analysis was used to determine the degree of disorder of the synthesized
carbon materials by comparing the peak area of the disordered carbon
(I(D)) to graphitic carbon (I(G)).
The Raman spectra peak intensity ratio I(D)/I(G) was calculated, where I(D) is the
intensity of the D band peak at 1600 cm–1 and I(G) is the peak intensity of the G band at 1350 cm–1.

5.4 Catalytic Performance Test
of Mo2C/APC and Acid-Treated Mo2C/APC
The Mo2C/APC and the corresponding acid-treated samples
were assessed for
esterification using the model reactants acetic acid and 1-butanol
at a mole ratio of 1:1 reacted at 77 °C for 2 h in a stirred
batch reactor under a N2 atmosphere.39 The catalysts 0.25Mo2C/APC_R1000, 0.50Mo2C/APC_R900, 1Mo2C/APC_R900, 2Mo2C/APC_R900,
and APC_800 were assessed together with their corresponding acid-treated
samples. In each case, the same amount of catalyst was used (ca. 0.2
g) and the reactor liquid volume was held constant at 20 mL. After
the reaction, the liquid product was separated from the catalyst by
a centrifuge and diluted 50 times in acetone prior to quantitative
analysis using Shimadzu (QP-2010-S) GC-MS and a Restek RTX5 30 m ×
0.25 mm capillary column. The conversion of 1-butanol after 2 h was
taken as a measure of catalyst activity. Repeat experiments showed
that the measurement error associated with the conversion was ±5%
of the measured conversion. The esterification reaction was assumed
to proceed through a second-order reaction with the reaction rate40 given by: r(mol·gcat–1·s–1) = k*CACB where CA is the butanol concentration and CB, the acetic acid concentration. Assuming a perfectly
mixed phase inside the reactor volume and writing the component concentrations
in terms of butanol conversion X, one obtains the
equation: dX/dt = −kCA0(1 – X)2 with k = k*Ccat, where Ccat is the catalyst
concentration in the mixed reactor and CA0 is the initial concentration of butanol. Hence the second-order
rate constant k is determined from the equation k = X*[CA0t(1 – X)]−1 and
the butanol conversion data.41 Finally,
the catalyst turnover frequency (TOF) was estimated by dividing the
rate r measured at the conversion X by the NH3 uptake.
