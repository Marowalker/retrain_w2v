Successful intracellular delivery
of genes requires an efficient
carrier, as genes by themselves cannot diffuse across cell membranes.
Because of the toxicity and immunogenicity of viral vectors, nonviral
vectors are gaining tremendous interest in research. In this work,
we have investigated the temperature-dependent DNA condensation efficiency
of various compositions of a thermosensitive block copolymer viz.,
poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-b-poly(2-(diethylamino)ethyl
methacrylate) (PNIPA-b-PDMAEMA). Three different
copolymer compositions of varying molecular weights were successfully
synthesized via the RAFT polymerization technique. Steady-state fluorescence
and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies, dynamic light scattering
(DLS) and zeta potential measurements, agarose gel electrophoresis,
and atomic force microscopy techniques were utilized to study the
interaction of the copolymers with DNA at temperatures above and below
the critical aggregation temperature (CAT). All these
experiments revealed that, above the CAT, there was
formation of highly stable and tight polymer–DNA complexes
(polyplexes). The size of polyplexes was dependent on the temperature
up to a certain charge ratio, as determined by the DLS results. The
results obtained from temperature-dependent fluorescence spectroscopy,
CD, and gel electrophoresis indicated that the DNA molecules were
shielded more from aqueous exposure above the CAT because of the formation of relatively more compact complexes. The
polyplexes also exhibited changes in the particle morphology below
and above the CAT, with particles generated above CAT being more spherical in morphology. These results suggested
at the possibility of modulating the complex formation by temperature
modification. The present biophysical studies would provide new physical
insight into the design of novel gene carriers.

Introduction
Nonviral gene delivery
vectors are becoming increasingly attractive
as gene carriers1,2 because of their high flexibility
with respect to the size and nature of DNA delivered, low immunogenicity,
besides relatively low cost of production, etc.3−5 Among the nonviral
vectors, polycations can easily condense the DNA chains containing
negatively charged phosphate groups into compact complexes, thus facilitating
the entry of the complex into the cells via endocytosis and subsequent
dissociation of complexes for the release of DNA.6−9 For example, poly(ethylenimine)
(PEI), mostly a highly branched structure that is commercially available,
is one of the most efficient polycation systems studied widely for
gene delivery.9−13 However, PEI exhibits disruption of the cell membrane and a higher
cell cytotoxicity, partly because of a significantly high cation content,
and also shows lower efficiency in terms of transcription and transfection
as compared to most viral vectors.14 Linear
poly((2-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA)15−18 is another example of a popular
polycation for gene therapy because of its relatively lower cytotoxicity
than PEI19 and easy preparation. There
are also other polycations, which may be used as gene vehicles, such
as 2-(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA)-based star copolymers,19,20 cationic peptides,21 dendrimer polycations,22−24 hyperbranched poly(amino ester)s,25,26 and polysaccharide-based
cationic carriers.27

The main objectives
for the development of nonviral vectors are
enhanced responsivity,28,29 specificity, transfection efficiency,
and reduction of cell cytotoxicity.30,31 It has been
reported that above the normal body temperature, a direct cytotoxic
effect on cancer cells has been noticed, whereas at lower temperatures,
an immunostimulatory effect as well as radiation- and chemosensibilization
occur.32 Again, an additional advantage
of application of heat at the targeting site is to achieve increase
of the permeability of the tissue, allowing cell entry of gene carriers.
In principle, this effect can also be effectively used for gene-delivery
systems, for example, polyplexes,33,34 by facilitating
easy penetration of gene into the cells.

One of the potential
routes by which such DNA-binding modulation
or switching can be attained is by using responsive or “smart”
polymers capable of conformational or phase changes under the effect
of varying pH and temperatures.35−37 Haladjova et al.38 have recently reported the preparation of mesoglobules
using thermosensitive polymers as potential reservoirs, vehicles,
and transferring agents for biologically active substances such as
DNA etc. Thermosensitive star-shaped copolymers having branched chains
were designed by Zhou et al., which can potentially serve as gene
carriers with improved gene transfection efficiency.39 Hinrichs et al.40 showed that
the transfection efficiency as well as cytotoxicity were influenced
by changing both the size and zeta potential of thermosensitive copolymer/plasmid
complexes by tuning the temperature. Again, Takeda et al.41 reported that the affinity of temperature-sensitive
polymeric carriers incorporating hydrophobic monomers is reduced by
lowering the incubation temperature below the lower critical solution
temperature (LCST), suggesting that a thermally regulated gene expression
can enable DNA release from the polymeric carrier in a more effective
manner.

Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPA),
one of the
most widely studied responsive polymers, is known to undergo a sharp
coil–globule transition in water at 32 °C (LCST) resulting
from the hydrophilic to hydrophobic phase transition.42 This property has been utilized for biomedical applications,
ranging from pulsatile drug release to control of cell adhesion, mainly
because the LCST is close to our body temperature.43 Incorporation of PNIPA in a block polycation may lead to
the formation of a compact and stable complex at a higher temperature
because of collapsing of the PNIPA chains. Thus, by simply changing
the temperature, it is possible to control the transition of the polyplex
from tight or compact (prevents DNA degradation) to loosely bound
complexes (suitable for transfection).44,45 In this regard N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPA) and DMAEMA- based thermosensitive
block polycations have been explored for gene-delivery applications.39,40

Although thermosensitive polycations based on NIPA and DMAEMA
have
been already explored for gene-delivery applications, including cell-cytotoxicity
and transfection efficiency study of polyplexes, detailed biophysical
investigations on the influence of thermosensitive components in the
block polycation on the properties of polyplexes are needed. Moreover,
in this study, we have synthesized block copolymers (BCPs) of DMAEMA
and NIPA of different compositions and molecular weights via the RAFT
polymerization technique. This technique is more efficient than free
radical copolymerization to get more control over the molecular weight
and dispersity.40,46,47 The structure of the copolymers used here for studying the interaction
behavior is linear, whereas the previous studies were of a different
architecture. Here, we report the interaction behaviors of the synthesized
thermosensitive BCPs with calf thymus DNA (ctDNA) in detail using various biophysical techniques for
the evaluation of the potential of these BCPs as gene carriers.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis of Cationic BCPs
The diblock
copolymers of
NIPA and DMAEMA were synthesized by the RAFT polymerization process
(Scheme 1). At first,
PNIPA macro-chain transfer agent (CTA) was synthesized by polymerizing
NIPA using S-1-dodecyl-S′-(α,α′-dimethyl-α″-acetic
acid)trithiocarbonate (DDMAT) as the primary CTA. The number average
molecular weight (Mn) of the synthesized
PNIPA macro-CTA was determined by proton nuclear magnetic resonance
(1H NMR) spectroscopy. The intensity of the peak at 0.88
ppm corresponding to the three protons of the terminal methyl group
of the dodecyl unit of DDMAT was compared with the intensity of one
proton at 4.1 ppm of NIPA repeat units (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Mn of
PNIPA macro-CTA was obtained as 8600 g mol–1 that
corresponds to the presence of 76 NIPA units in the macro-CTA. In
the next step, DMAEMA was copolymerized in the presence of PNIPA macro-CTA
to synthesize the desired BCPs. The 1H NMR spectrum of
one of the copolymers is provided in Figure 1. The 1H NMR spectra of the other
two copolymers are given in the Supporting Information (Figures S2 and S3). The composition of the BCPs was determined
by comparing the intensities of two methylene protons (a, at ∼4.06
ppm) adjacent to oxygen of the ester group plus two methylene protons
(b, at ∼2.6 ppm) adjacent to the amine group in the PDMAEMA
block with the intensity of one tertiary proton (d, at 4.06 ppm) of
the isopropyl group in the PNIPA block. The gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) traces of the three BCPs are provided in the Supporting Information (Figure S4). All polymers showed unimodal
peaks having narrow dispersity (Đ) values,
(<1.30), confirming the formation of BCPs. The molecular weight
and composition of the three synthesized diblock copolymers (NIDM108,
NIDM135, and NIDM158) are given in Table 1.

Thermally
Induced Self-Assembly of BCPs
Temperature-induced
phase transition of the PNIPA-b-PDMAEMA copolymers
in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH = 4.2) was investigated by
measuring the transmittance at 500 nm as a function of the temperature.
On increasing the temperature above 32 °C, transparent copolymer
solutions turned hazy, which was manifested in the decreasing value
of transparency (Figure 2a). However, the reduction in the transmittance value for these copolymers
was less sharp than those observed for PNIPA macro-CTA (PNIPA homopolymer)
that shows LCST at ∼32 °C.42,48 This is due
to the presence of the hydrophilic PDMAEMA block in the copolymer.
Moreover, unlike the PNIPA homopolymer (where the transmittance values
decreased to near zero and the polymer became insoluble), for the
BCPs, the transmittance values did not decrease to near zero, indicating
the formation of self-assembled nanoaggregates having a comparatively
higher solubility and stability above a certain temperature. All BCP
solutions were kept at 40 °C for longer than a week, and no precipitation
was observed. After the critical aggregation temperature (CAT), the PNIPA block
of the BCPs became hydrophobic but the PDMAEMA block remained hydrophilic,
which resulted in the formation of self-assembled aggregates. This
established the water-soluble nature of the BCP aggregates at this
temperature. The critical temperature above which the aggregation
was formed (CAT) was found to be ∼34, ∼35.5,
and ∼36.5 °C for NIDM108, NIDM135, and NIDM158, respectively.
The temperature corresponding to 50% drop in transmittance was considered
as the CAT (Figure 2a). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement was
also performed to follow the temperature-induced self-association
of these BCPs. With DLS, we can determine the average hydrodynamic
diameters (DH) of the BCPs; from the change
of DH with the temperature, we can also
detect their CAT. The average hydrodynamic diameters
(DH) of all polymers were found to be
∼20 nm at 25 °C. The size increased with the increase
in the temperature above the transition point because of the formation
of self-assembled aggregates. The size of the aggregates was more
or less similar for the three copolymers. The average hydrodynamic
diameter (DH) of the copolymers at various
temperatures is shown in Figure 2b. The zeta potential values of the copolymer solutions
also displayed an abrupt increase at around the CAT (Figure 2c). The
increase in the zeta potential is most likely due to the self-assembly
of the copolymer molecules. Above the CAT, the PNIPA
molecules form the core and the charged PDMAEMA forms the shell of
the nanoparticles that results in a higher surface charge concentration
and consequently a higher zeta potential.35,49

diameter (DH) and (c) zeta potential of

Interaction of ctDNA with
the BCPs
Interaction between ctDNA and the
PNIPA-b-PDMAEMA copolymers was studied in 10 mM potassium
phosphate
buffer (pH = 4.2) at various solution temperatures. At pH = 4.2, the
amino groups of DMAEMA units are protonated, and the polymers become
cationic, facilitating the electrostatic interaction between negatively
charged DNA molecules. In the present work, the binding between the
BCPs and ctDNA was studied using the turbidity measurement,
ethidium bromide (EB) dye exclusion assay (steady-state fluorescence),
DLS, zeta potential measurements, agarose gel electrophoresis, CD,
and atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies.

Colloidal Stability of
the Polyplexes
Turbidity measurements
were performed to record the stability of the polyplexes at 25 °C
(below CAT) and 40 °C (above CAT). The results showed insignificant turbidity values at 25 °C
for all polyplexes, which were nearly unchanged for 10 days, suggesting
no precipitation (Supporting Information, Figures S5 and S6). Therefore, it is evident that the BCPs had
the ability to condense DNA efficiently, forming nanosized polyplexes
with an enhanced colloidal stability. At 40 °C, a very little
increase of turbidity was observed for the polyplexes. The stability
at lower and higher charge ratios was provided predominantly by the
net anionic or cationic charges in the polyplexes, as indicated by
the zeta potential values of the complex (discussed later). Neutral
or nearly neutral polyplexes were stabilized by the lyophilizing effect
of the nonionic hydrophilic PNIPA blocks present in the copolymers.
The later stabilization effect is quiet comparable with a report published
by Ambardekar et al.50 They reported that
polyethylenimine-g-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEI–PEG)
graft copolymer produced stable neutralized/electropositive polyplexes
with siRNA because of the solubilizing effect of the neutral hydrophilic
PEG chain.

Steady-State Fluorescence Spectroscopic Studies
EB
dye exclusion assay was used to monitor the interaction between the
copolymers and ctDNA. It has been well-known that
EB can easily bind to DNA by intercalation into the hydrophobic G–C
and A–T base pairs, thereby resulting in a high fluorescence
intensity.24 Intercalated EB in DNA molecules
can be effectively dislodged from the DNA double-helix by polycations
that include cationic BCPs. The fluorescence intensity of EB in the
DNA–EB complex gets reduced on addition of the cationic agents,
owing to the change in the surrounding of the EB dye from hydrophobic
(DNA helix) to hydrophilic (buffer medium). In this particular study
also, the decrease in the fluorescence intensity as a result of displacement
of EB molecules from the DNA double-helix by the NIDM copolymers was
utilized to monitor the copolymer–ctDNA polyplex
formation.

Polyplexes were prepared in the range of Z+/– values of 0–6; fluorescence
spectra were taken at four different temperatures; 15 min of equilibration
time was provided at each temperature before recording the spectra.
The change in the fluorescence intensity of EB with increasing Z+/– ratios is shown in Figure 3. A reduction in the fluorescence
intensity was observed till Z+/– ≈ 1, above which the EB displacement profile reached a plateau.
This particular Z+/– value did
not change significantly with temperature for a particular copolymer.
But, the decrease in the fluorescence intensity was the steepest for
NIDM108. Formation of copolymer–ctDNA polyplexes
can be attributed to the ionic interaction of the positive charges
on the polymer with the negatively charged phosphate groups of ctDNA. As the length of the cationic block was the shortest
in NIDM108, for a given Z+/– value,
the number of such polymers present in the solution was more. This
results in relatively easier access to the negatively charged phosphate
groups in DNA for the cationic charges in the block.

Figure 3 (a) Fluorescence spectra
of the EB–DNA complex in the presence
of NIDM108 corresponding to Z+/– = 1 at 25 and 40 °C. (b–d) present the relative fluorescence
intensity of the EB–DNA complex in the presence of various
amounts of NIDM108, NIDM135, and NIDM158, respectively, at four different
temperatures.

Although the nature of
the EB exclusion curves was not affected
by temperature variation, the extent of this polymer–DNA interaction
was clearly temperature-dependent, with a higher amount of EB displaced
at temperatures above the CAT of the polymers. The
fluorescence intensity of EB for polyplexes with NIDM108 decreased
maximum by ∼85%; the decrease for the other two copolymers
NIDM135 and NIDM158 were ∼78 and ∼73%, respectively,
at 25 °C. NIDM108 showed the highest displacement of EB, whereas
NIDM158 displaced the lowest amount of EB in the series at the same
charge ratio (Z+/–). The displacement
of EB for all BCPs was higher at 40 and 45 °C (i.e., above CAT) than that at 25 and 28 °C. A comparison of data
presented in Figure 3b–d showed that the effect of temperature on EB displacement
was the most prominent for NIDM108 and the least for NIDM158. The
same data can be replotted to infer that the relative difference in
the EB-displacement capability among the three BCPs gets amplified
at a temperature above the CAT (please see Figure
S7, Supporting Information). Significant
electrostatic interaction continued to happen between the cationic
PDMAEMA block and DNA till the charge neutralization occurs. Once
this neutralization process is achieved, further hydrophobic interaction
between the PNIPA chain and DNA moiety starts taking effect. As the
electrostatic interaction between the cationic PDMAEMA block and DNA
brings the PNIPA chains to a close proximity to the DNA chains, the
local concentration of PNIPA chains around the DNA got increased,
resulting in a hydrophobic interaction between PNIPA and hydrophobic
DNA bases, especially above the CAT. Therefore, PNIPA
might induce additional condensation of DNA in a synergistic manner.
Similar observations were reported by us while studying the interaction
of DNA with PEGylated cationic BCPs.51,52 For a given
charge ratio, the NIDM108 copolymer would have a higher concentration
of temperature-sensitive PNIPA chains, helping in higher compaction
of the polyplexes, which forced more EB to be released.

DLS Measurements
The DLS technique provides useful
information about the average hydrodynamic diameters and polydispersities
of DNA–cationic BCP polyplexes. The sizes of the polyplexes
are dependent on the charge ratios. The average size versus charge
ratios for the three copolymers at two different temperatures, 25
°C (below CAT) and 40 °C (above CAT), are presented in Figure 4 (the data for other temperatures can be
seen in Figure S8, Supporting Information), and the polydispersities of polyplexes along with the intensity-weighted
average hydrodynamic diameters are tabulated in Table 2 (intensity-weighted size distributions are
given in the Supporting Information, Figure
S9). For both the temperatures, a gradual decrease in the average
size occurred from ∼700–750 nm (the size of free ctDNA) to ∼200–300 nm for the ctDNA–BCP polyplexes at Z+/– ≈ 1.0 for NIDM108 and at Z+/– ≈ 1.5 for NIDM135 and NIDM158. After this charge ratio, the
average size of the polyplexes increased drastically to about 1000–1100
nm at Z+/– = 6 for all three polymers.
From the studies of the size distribution (please see Figure S9 in
the Supporting Information and Table 2) of polyplex particles,
it was also noted that an inverse relationship between Z+/– and the mean polydispersity of the corresponding
polyplexes was observed for most of the polyplex formations up to
the effective charge neutralization, Z+/– ≈ 1.0 for NIDM108 and Z+/– ≈ 1.5 for NIDM135 and NIDM158. Above these Z+/– values, the polydispersity gets increased because
of aggregation between the polyplexes, as discussed above. For all Z+/– values studied, the polyplexes exhibited
an acceptable (<0.420) mean polydispersity. Moselhy et al.53 reported that the sizes of the polyplexes formed
from the thermosensitive cationic nanogel (based on NIPA and DMAEMA)
with salmon sperm DNA were around 450–700 nm, which were bigger
than our system at the neutralization point.

At lower Z+/– values, polyplexes
from NIDM108 had the lowest sizes among the three polyplexes. These
results indicate that NIDM108 had the highest efficiency among all
the copolymers in condensing the DNA molecule till the size reached
a minimum. As discussed earlier, as the length of the cationic block
was the shortest in NIDM108, for a given charge ratio, the number
of such polymers present in the solution was more. This probably provided
relatively easier access to the negatively charged phosphate groups
in DNA for the cationic charges in NIDM108, resulting in higher compaction.
It was also observed that for the charge ratios near and below the
neutralization point, compaction was more above the CAT in comparison to below the CAT (Figure S9, Supporting Information). As discussed previously,
this increased compaction was due to the PNIPA-induced additional
condensation of DNA chains. However, after the neutralization, the
size of the polyplexes above the CAT was larger than
that below the CAT. This may be due to increased
aggregation between the individual polyplexes through the hydrophobic
interaction of PNIPA chains above the CAT. At higher Z+/– values (>1.5), polyplexes from
NIDM108
had larger sizes compared to other polyplexes. For a given charge
ratio, NIDM108 provided maximum number of PNIPA chains for aggregate
formation, causing formation of large-sized aggregates. This result
is slightly amplified at a higher temperature.

Zeta Potential
Measurements
The zeta potential (ζ)
values of different polyplexes in the buffer at four different temperatures
25, 28, 40, and 45 °C are depicted in Figure 5. The zeta potential of free ctDNA was found to be around −20 mV because of the presence
of negatively charged phosphate groups. With the addition of the cationic
polymers, the zeta potential of the polyplexes gradually increased
until a plateau value of around 15–25 mV was reached at Z+/– = 3–6.41,54 The increased zeta potential with increase in Z+/– may be possibly due to a gradual covering of
the negatively charged DNA by the positively charged polymer. Here,
we can see that neutrally charged polyplexes were formed at different
charge ratios for different polymers. Charge ratios for the formation
of neutral polyplexes corresponds to a Z+/– value of ∼0.7 for NIDM108 and between 1.0 and 1.5 for both
NIDM135 and NIDM158 at all temperatures. The formation of neutral
polyplexes by NIDM108 at a lower charge ratio explains a more compact
polyplex formed because of the reasons explained earlier. The same
data can be replotted to infer that the zeta potentials of polyplexes
formed by the three BCPs gets amplified at a temperature above the CAT (Figure S10, Supporting Information).

Figure 5 Zeta potential (ζ) of DNA–cationic BCP polyplexes
at a fixed DNA concentration of 25 μM and varying concentrations
of copolymers (a) NIDM108, (b) NIDM135, and (c) NIDM158, respectively.
Zeta potentials were determined at 25, 28, 40, and 45 °C.

Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
The binding capability
of the BCPs has been investigated qualitatively via agarose gel electrophoresis.44,45 In this experiment, we prepared the polyplexes at 25 and 40 °C,
and the electrophoresis assay was also conducted at 25 and 45 °C.
The concentration of the dye was much lower (1 μg/mL) in these
experiments than in the EB exclusion assays, and the dye was added
to the loading buffer after polyplex formation rather than before
(as in the dye exclusion assay). Images of gels obtained on electrophoresis
of the polyplexes are shown in Figure 6. Here, we can see that the migration of polyplexes
was retarded with an increase in the charge ratio from 0.25 to 3,
and much more DNA was restricted in the wells at 25 °C. These
retardations imply the neutralization of negatively charged DNA by
positively charged copolymers as well as the higher molecular weight
of the formed polyplexes. A complete reduction of the migration of
DNA was observed at a charge ratio less than 1.0 for NIDM108 and just
higher than 1.0 for the other two copolymers as a consequence of charge
neutralization. The charge ratio values were in agreement with the
zeta potential data. Earlier retardation of NIDM108 polyplexes through
the gel at lower charge ratios is thus indicative of higher DNA binding
capability of NIDM108. Electrophoresis was also carried out at temperatures
above the CAT for these copolymers. Between a temperature
below or above the CAT of thermosensitive copolymers,
a noticeable change in the retardation bands was observed for NIDM108/DNA
complexes, but slight shifts in the electrophoretic mobility of the
other two polymer–DNA complexes were observed. It was also
noticed that, while at 40 °C, the movement of NIDM108/DNA complexes
was completely restricted at a charge ratio of 0.8, same could not
be said at 25 °C. This implied the formation of more stable NIDM108/DNA
complexes at a higher temperature. Similar results were also observed
for the EB exclusion assay. Additionally, bands of the polyplexes
were found to be of lower intensity above the CAT, implying the formation of DNA polyplexes into which the EB dye
could intercalate to a lesser extent because of the collapse of the
PNIPA side chain. This indicates the formation of more tight polyplexes
above the CAT than those formed below the CAT.

Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy
CD spectroscopy
has been widely used to monitor the conformational change of DNA upon
complexation with thermosensitive gene delivery vectors.55 None of the copolymers used here showed any
significant CD signal within the UV region investigated, which means
that the observed signals arise entirely from the DNA molecules. The
CD spectrum of free ctDNA is typical of the B conformation
showing a positive signal at 275 nm due to stacking of bases and a
negative minimum near 245 nm due to the helical structure of the polynucleotide.56 A significant change in the DNA conformation
was observed when DNA was complexed with cationic polymers at different
charge ratios. Typically, the CD spectra (Figure 7a–c) showed a gradual decrease in
the molar ellipticity values of the positive signal, concomitant with
a red shift as the polymer fraction in the complexes was increased.
In most cases, the negative signal also shifted to higher wavelengths,
with decreased molar ellipticity values. For the NIDM108 copolymer,
CD signals reached a plateau level, but the other two did not exhibit
saturation. Again, it is clearly observed from Figure 7 that the CD intensity at 275 nm decreased
to a certain degree when the temperature was increased from 25 to
40 °C.

various amounts of BCPs recorded at 25 and 40 °C. (d–f)
On the right-hand side, dependence of θ (275 nm) on the charge
ratios determined at 25 and 40 °C.

Generally, DNA remained as the B conformation in the complexes
both at 25 and 40 °C. The ellipticities at 275 nm [θ (275
nm)] of the polyplexes are plotted45 as
a function of the charge ratios in Figure 7d–f. These temperature-induced peak
intensity changes can be explained as follows. At temperatures below
the CAT, a loose structure of polyplex is formed
because of the hydration of PNIPA chains rendering more DNA exposure.
But, at 40 °C (above the CAT), the collapsed
PNIPA chains tightly cover the surface of the polyplex, protecting
DNA from exposure. As a result, the CD signals are decreased at a
higher temperature.

Effect of Temperature on the Morphology of
Polyplexes Using
AFM
AFM images were obtained to gain further insight into
the temperature-dependent behavior of the polyplexes. These studies
demonstrated the potential of temperature-sensitive polymers in DNA
delivery. We find that the degree of DNA condensation can be controlled
by temperature. The AFM images suggest (Figure 8) that above the CAT, the
polyplexes were reasonably homogeneous in size, and that, they possessed
a nearly compact spherical and globular morphology due to heavy dehydration
of PNIPA chains; but below the CAT, these were slightly
elongated in morphology. Bao et al.57 summarized
through transmission electron microscopy images that a more uniform
morphology of particles can be achieved by the complexation of thermosensitive
chitosan-based terpolymers with DNA above the CAT. Globules are, for the design of a gene carrier, the most desired
morphology for gene transfection and cell entry. The condensing ability
of the copolymers also decreased from NIDM108 to NIDM158 because of
the gradual decrease of the weight content of NIPA units in copolymers;
also, a higher NIPA content introduced more reduction in the size.
Polyplex aggregation also occurred in the form of larger aggregates
at a higher charge ratio.

a charge ratio of
1.0. (a–c) Polyplexes are formed from NIDM108, NDM135, and

°C. (d–f) Polyplexes are formed from NIDM108, NDM135,
and NIDM158, respectively; polyplexes are prepared and deposited at
40 °C.

Effect of pH on the Polyplexes
To find out the effect
of pH on the complexation behavior of the BCPs and ctDNA, EB exclusion assay was performed at different pH values at 25
°C by taking NIDM108/ctDNA polyplex at Z+/– = 1.0. At pH 7.4, the relative fluorescence
intensity was found to be 0.34, which was significantly higher than
the value at pH = 4.2 (0.19). This confirmed a comparatively weak
complexation behavior at pH = 7.4 because of a lower charge density
in the PDMAEMA block. Further, to find the usefulness of the polyplex
formed at pH = 4.2, the polyplex was first prepared at pH = 4.2, following
which the pH was step-wise increased to 7.4 by the addition of dilute
NaOH, and the fluorescence spectra (EB exclusion assay) and hydrodynamic
size were recorded after allowing 15 min of equilibration time at
each pH. With the increase in pH, more EB was excluded from DNA, and
the size of the polyplex was gradually increased, although the EB
exclusion at pH = 7.4 was lower than the value when the complexation
was carried out directly at pH = 7.4 (Figure S11, Supporting Information). This means that the total time provided
during the pH change process was not sufficient to reach equilibrium
value at pH = 7.4. To get some idea about the time required to reach
equilibrium, the polyplex was prepared at pH = 4.2, and then, the
pH was increased to 7.4 at once, and the EB exclusion and hydrodynamic
size were monitored with time. As it can be seen from Figure S12 (Supporting Information), even after 30 min, there
was no significant change in the size or EB exclusion, after which
the EB release and size increase happened gradually. This indicates
that, potentially, the polyplex formed at pH = 4.2 can maintain its
integrity for the first 30 min in physiological condition before slowly
loosening up.

Summary
In this study, BCPs of DMAEMA
and NIPA were evaluated as thermosensitive
carrier systems for DNA. The BCPs formed self-assembled nanoparticles
above a certain temperature (CAT). The copolymers
effectively condensed DNA into neutrally or slightly charged tight
particles of size around 200–300 nm for the charge ratio between
1.0 and 1.5. This size range is optimum for efficient transfection.
The complexation behavior between DNA and the copolymers was found
to be dependent on the surrounding temperature. Although at temperatures
below the CAT, comparatively loosely bound polyplexes
were formed, above the CAT, relatively tight complexes
were formed because of temperature-induced collapse of PNIPA chains
of the copolymers in aqueous medium. The results suggest that the
synthesis of thermosensitive polymers may enable compaction of DNA
into nanosized particles that may potentially be rapidly taken up
by the cells. Further, a relatively easy release of DNA from the loosely
packed polyplexes may be favorable for transcription. This thorough
biophysical investigation provides valuable insight into the DNA–thermosensitive
polymer complexation phenomenon, which has direct consequences on
the release behavior of DNA from the gene-delivery vectors.

Experimental
Section
Materials
DMAEMA, NIPA, 2,2′-azobisisobutyronitril
(AIBN), sodium salt of ctDNA, and EB were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used as such. DDMAT was made according to a
reported procedure with some modification.58 All experiments were performed in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer
(pH = 4.2) prepared using Milli-Q water. All of the other chemicals
used were of analytical reagent grade and used without any purification.
Unless otherwise specified, the concentrations of DNA solutions are
provided in mol L–1 in terms of the negatively charged
phosphate groups in the DNA backbone.

Synthesis and Characterization
of BCPs
Synthesis of Diblock Copolymers (PNIPA-b-PDMAEMA)
(Scheme 1)
Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) macro-CTA was synthesized
in the first step, using AIBN as the initiator at 70 °C in the
presence of DDMAT as the primary CTA. Polymerization was conducted
under a N2 atmosphere for 18 h in 1,4-dioxan medium. The
ratio of the monomer (NIPA) to CTA, that is, [M]0/[CTA]0 was 100:1 and the CTA to initiator ratio, that is, [CTA]0/[I]0 was 3:1. The reaction was quenched by cooling
the polymer solution in liquid nitrogen, followed by dilution with
a small quantity of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and subsequent precipitation
into excess ice-cold diethyl ether to isolate the polymer. The process
of precipitation was repeated thrice, and finally, the pure solid
polymer was isolated by filtration followed by vacuum drying for ∼12
h. Thereafter, this poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) macro-CTA
was used for polymerizing DMAEMA in 1,4-dioxan at 70 °C for 24
h under a nitrogen atmosphere to yield three BCPs with the desired
number of DMAEMA units. The polymerization reaction was quenched in
the usual way using liquid nitrogen, and the polymer was isolated
by precipitation. This was followed by dialysis using cellulose membranes
(molecular weight cutoff value ∼12 kDa) against distilled water
for 3 days with frequent change of water (four times a day). The pure
copolymer solution was then lyophilized, freeze-dried, and characterized
by 1H NMR spectroscopy and GPC for its final composition.

1H NMR spectra were taken in CDCl3 using
a Bruker DPX-400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The spectra were calibrated
using the residual solvent signal as the internal standard. The number-average
(Mn) molecular weight, weight-average
molecular weight (Mw), and dispersity
(D̵ = Mw/Mn) of the synthesized BCPs were determined by
a GPC (Viscotek TDAmax) system equipped with refractive index, differential
pressure viscometry, and dual-angle light scattering (λ = 670
nm, 90° and 7°) detectors and an isocratic pump (Agilent
1200), using THF (high-performance liquid chromatography grade) as
the mobile phase with a flow rate of 1 mL/min at 33 °C. Triple
detector array assembly is advantageous as chromatographic calibrations
are not necessary. The light scattering detector was calibrated using
polystyrene standards having a low polydispersity (Mn = 105 164, Mw/Mn = 1.02, and [η] = 0.48 dL g–1 at 33 °C in THF, dn/dc =
0.185 mL g–1) provided by the supplier Viscotek.

Turbidity measurement was done from the transmittance data at 500
nm obtained by using a Cary 5000 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer
with a digital temperature controller (Varian Scientific Instruments).
The concentrations of the aqueous polymer solutions were maintained
at 1.0 g L–1. The solution was heated from 18 to
50 °C, and transmissions were recorded. A plot of % transmittance
versus temperature was used to estimate the cloud point of the BCP
solution. DLS measurement was used to determine the hydrodynamic diameter
(DH) of the BCPs in aqueous solutions,
using a Malvern Nano ZS instrument equipped with a thermostated sample
chamber, using a 4 mW He–Ne laser (λ = 632.8 nm). The
detector angle was fixed at 173°. The zeta (ζ) potential
of the BCPs was measured in the temperature range of 25–45
°C using a Malvern Nano ZS instrument equipped with a 15 mV solid-state
laser operating at a wavelength of 635 nm.

Characterization
of Polymer–ctDNA Polyplexes
Preparation
of Polymer–ctDNA Polyplexes
A ctDNA stock solution was prepared in 10 mM potassium
phosphate buffer (pH = 4.2) at 25 °C. The concentration of the
DNA stock solution was measured using a UV–visible spectrophotometer.
The concentration of ctDNA (with respect to the negatively
charged phosphate groups) was 712 μM, measured from its absorbance
data at 260 nm with a molar extinction coefficient (ε) of 6600
M–1 cm–1. The concentration of
DNA with respect to the base pairs is exactly half the concentration
of the phosphate groups (ε = 13 200 M–1 cm–1). The ratio of the absorbance values of the
DNA solution at 260 and 280 nm was 1.82, whereas the absorbance measured
at 320 nm was negligible, suggesting the absence of any protein contamination.
The EB stock solution was made by dissolving 2.2 mg in 1 mL of phosphate
buffer. UV–visible spectrophotometer (ε = 5600 M–1 cm–1 at 480 nm) was used to determine
the concentration. The EB solutions were stored in the dark at 4 °C
prior to use. The BCP stock solutions (5150 μM) were prepared
by dissolving a known weight of a given copolymer in the required
volume of 10 mM phosphate buffer solution (pH = 4.2). The polymer–DNA
polyplexes were prepared by adding the required amount of polymer
solution to a ctDNA solution in 10 mM potassium phosphate
buffer (pH = 4.2) to achieve an appropriate polymer-to-DNA charge
ratio (Z+/–). This was followed
by vortexing and equilibration for 1 h.59−61Z+/– was expressed as the ratio of equivalents of cationic
DMAEMA units (from 1H NMR) to the number of phosphate groups
(negatively charged) in DNA. The final concentration of ctDNA was kept fixed at 25 μM (except for CD spectroscopy, where
100 μM of ctDNA solution was taken) with respect
to the phosphate groups. Polyplexes were prepared in the range of Z+/– values of 0–6.

Determination
of Colloidal Stability of Polyplexes
Turbidity assays were
used to study the colloidal stabilities of
the polyplexes formed at Z+/– =
0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0. The polyplexes were prepared at 25 °C,
vortexed, and equilibrated for 1 h. Turbidity values were monitored
for 10 days by taking the transmittance at 550 nm by using a Cary
5000 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer (Varian Scientific
Instruments) fitted with a digital temperature controller. Similar
measurements were also done at 40 °C.

Steady-State Fluorescence
Spectroscopic Studies
The
steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded with help of a Jobin
Yvon Fluorolog Spectrofluorometer using an excitation wavelength of
480 nm, and the emission spectra were recorded in the range of 500–700
nm wavelength. The excitation and emission slits were fixed at 5 and
2 nm, respectively. To make the DNA–EB complex, the DNA and
EB stock solutions were mixed (1 EB:1 bp) in the phosphate buffer
and equilibrated for 10 min. To a ctDNA–EB
mixture (1 mL) in a quartz cuvette, the desired amounts of NIDM stock
solutions were added. The steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded
at four different temperatures 25, 28, 40, and 45 °C. After addition
of a given NIDM solution, the resultant mixture was equilibrated for
10 min at these four different temperatures before recording the spectrum.
The addition of NIDM solutions continued so that the charge ratio
could be varied from Z+/– = 0 to Z+/– = 6.

DLS Measurements
The size of ctDNA
and DNA–BCP complexes were characterized by means of DLS measurements
using a Malvern Nano ZS instrument with a thermostated sample chamber
employing a 4 mW He–Ne laser operating at a wavelength of 632.8
nm and an avalanche photodiode detector. All measurements were performed
at four different temperatures following the same procedure as discussed
in fluorescence spectroscopic studies. The concentration of ctDNA was kept fixed at 25 μM in terms of negatively
charged phosphate groups. The addition of copolymer solutions continued
so that the charge ratio was varied from Z+/– = 0 to Z+/– = 6. After mixing
the polymer with DNA in a cuvette, 10 min was allowed for equilibration
to each sample mixture for four different temperatures before recording
the spectrum. The average hydrodynamic diameter was provided by the
software itself. The software used cumulant algorithm to calculate
the distribution and averages.

Zeta (ζ) Potential
Measurements
Zeta potentials
of ctDNA and DNA–cationic copolymer complexes
prepared in phosphate buffer (pH = 4.2) were measured at the same
four different temperatures as mentioned before using a Malvern Nano
ZS instrument equipped with a 15 mV solid-state laser operating at
a wavelength of 635 nm.

Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
The
interaction between ctDNA and the cationic polymers
was investigated by gel
electrophoresis on agarose gel using 0.8% agarose gel containing EB
(1 μg/mL). All polyplexes were prepared at different charge
ratios (Z+/–) at 25 °C, and
the electrophoresis was done at 25 °C. For the run at 40 °C,
the agarose gel chamber was maintained at 40 °C, the polyplex
solutions were preheated to 40 °C before injecting in the wells.
The gel running buffer was 40 mM tris acetate (pH adjusted to 4.2)
and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The gel was run at 80 V
for 1 h, following which the DNA was visualized on a UV transilluminator
(254 nm).

CD Spectroscopy
The thermosensitive
conformational
changes of polymer–DNA complexes compared to free ctDNA were studied by the analysis of their CD spectra. CD spectra
were recorded using a JASCO 815 (Japan) CD spectrophotometer equipped
with a Peltier temperature controller to monitor the temperature of
the sample. All CD spectra were recorded in the range of 210–320
nm with a scan speed of 50 nm/min and a spectral band width of 10
nm. An average value obtained from three scans was taken for all experiments.
The background spectrum of the buffer solution (phosphate buffer,
pH = 4.2) was subtracted from the spectra of DNA and polymer–DNA
complexes. Typically, a solution of 100 μM ctDNA was titrated with the appropriate cationic polymer solution in
10 mM phosphate buffer from Z+/– = 0 to Z+/– = 5 at 25 °C,
and then, the temperature was increased to 40 °C as described
before.

AFM Characterization
AFM imaging was done using an
Agilent 5500 microscope without pretreatment of the sample. To take
the images of polymer–DNA complexes, the contact mode in air
was conducted on mica. The microfabricated Si-type NCH cantilevers
had a nominal spring constant of 0.2 N/m and a nominal resonance frequency
of 13 kHz. The scan rate employed was below 2 Hz to obtain good tracking
of the surface morphology. The polymer–DNA complexes were prepared
at Z+/– = 1 and kept at two different
temperatures 25 and 40 °C for 30 min, and then, a drop of the
sample solution was allowed to settle on the mica for 5 min. The samples
were air-dried overnight at respective temperatures. The images were
further autoflattened and analyzed using Agilent PicoView software.
