Type IV secretion systems are large
nanomachines assembled across
the bacterial cell envelope for effector translocation and conjugation.
VirB10 traverses the inner and outer membranes, sensing cellular signals
for coordinating the conformational switch for pilus biogenesis and/or
secretion. Mutations uncoupling secretion from pilus biogenesis were
identified in Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirB10 including a gating defect mutation G272R that made VirB10
unresponsive to intracellular ATP, causing unregulated secretion of
VirE2 in a contact-independent manner. Comparative long-timescale
molecular dynamics of the wild type and G272R mutant of the A. tumefaciens VirB10CTD tetradecamer
reveals how the G272R mutation locks the oligomer in a rigid conformation
by swapping the ionic interactions between the loops from the β-barrel
close to the inner leaflet of the outer membrane. This electrostatic
switching changes the allosteric communication pathway from the extracellular
loop to the base of the barrel, suggesting that the local conformational
dynamics in the loops can gate information across VirB10.

Introduction
Bacterial
type IV secretion (T4S) systems are large versatile molecular
machines that span the entire bacterial cell envelope coordinating
translocation of a diverse set of macromolecules to prokaryotic and
eukaryotic cells (recent reviews1−3). Conjugation machineries and
effector translocation systems are the main subfamilies of T4S systems.
They are the main virulence factors in various pathogenic bacteria
affecting plants, animals, and humans. Some examples of T4S systems
as virulence factors for pathogenesis include Agrobacterium
tumefaciens that causes crown-gall disease, Helicobacter pylori for the transport of oncoprotein
CagA leading to various gastrointestinal diseases, facilitating DNA
uptake for genomic plasticity and diversity in H. pylori, and DNA release in Neisseria gonorrhea to name a few.4 The best studied T4S
systems are the conjugation-related type IVa secretion system exemplified
by the VirB/D4 system in A. tumefaciens. The building blocks of the T4S system include the type IV coupling
protein (VirD4) that couples substrate recruitment to the secretion
channel, the energizing components (VirB4 and VirB11), the core channel
components (inner membrane: VirB3, VirB6, VirB8, and VirB10; and outer
membrane core complex: VirB7, VirB9, and VirB10), the hydrolase (VirB1),
and the pilus components (VirB2 (major) and VirB5 (minor)).

The structural architecture of the T4S system has come to light
in the last decade, revealing how the various components come together
to span the bilayer. The negative stain electron microscopy (nsEM)
structure of the TrwR388 T4S system (from plasmid R388)
VirB3–VirB10 complex revealed the membrane spanning structure
of the secretion channel composed of the outer membrane core complex
(OMCC) joined to the inner membrane complex (IMC) by a thin stalk.5 The IMC has a platform made of 12 copies of VirB3,
VirB5, and VirB8 proteins with 24 copies of the VirB6 protein with
14 copies of the VirB10 cytoplasmic transmembrane (TM) region connected
to two barrel-like structures of the hexameric cytoplasmic ATPase.
The OMCC is composed of 14 copies of VirB7, VirB9, and VirB10 proteins,
a conserved architecture seen in various OMCC structures including Escherichia coli conjugation plasmids pKM101 and R388, A. tumefaciens VirB/D4, Legionella pneumophila Dot/Icm,
and the H. pylori Cag T4S system.6−9 The OMCC has an outer layer (O-layer) formed by C-terminal domains
of VirB9 and VirB10 with lipoprotein VirB7 and an inner layer (I-layer)
formed by the N-terminal domains of VirB9 and VirB10. The high-resolution
crystal structure of the tetradecameric outer membrane complex (OMC)
of the T4S system (O-layer) from the E. coli conjugation plasmid pKM101 revealed the atomistic details of the
unusual helical outer membrane pore.10 The
O-layer has a main body and a cap. The cap forms the outer membrane
pore composed of two helix bundles of VirB10 proteins described as
the antenna projections (APs), and the basal body is entirely lined
on the interior by VirB10 and surrounded on the exterior by VirB9
and VirB7. This structure established that the VirB10 protein formed
the outer membrane pore and was the first protein known to traverse
both the inner and outer membrane—apt to be the scaffold protein
of the T4S system. The recent high-resolution Cryo-TEM structures
of the T4S system OMCC from bacteria-killing Xanthomonas
citri and the H. pylori Cag T4S system further confirm the conservation of this architecture.9,11

The crystal structure of TraF/VirB1010 in the O-layer reveals an N-terminal helical extended lever arm
that wraps around neighboring subunits followed by an atypical splayed
open β-barrel with loops bulging out between the β-strands
in the inter-subunit interface and an antenna projection (AP) emanating
out of the barrel forming a two-helix bundle (α2 helix–APL
loop−α3 helix; APL: antenna projection loop) wherein
the α2 helix forms the OM helical pore in the OMC structure.
The VirB10 protein is the sensor protein that coordinates the conformational
changes required for function based on intracellular signals and the
energy state of the ATPases.12 Seminal
experiments by Cascales and Christie12 showed
VirB10 to adopt alternate protease-susceptible or protease-resistant
conformations in response to the intracellular energy state of the
VirD4 and VirB11 ATPases. Energy poisons arsenate and protonophore
CCCP rendered VirB10 unable to adopt the protease-susceptible conformation.
Recent in situ Cryo-ET structures at various stages of assembly for
mating-competence and pilus biogenesis of the F plasmid conjugation
T4S system showed a structural transition between the body and cap
of the OMC (30 to 90°) at the inner leaflet of the OM to accommodate
the growing pilus.13 Although we have a
structural snapshot of the VirB10 oligomer in the OMC and structural
snapshots for larger secretion channel complexes, the molecular mechanism
of action or how the ATP state is conveyed by VirB10 in the OMC is
still not known.

During the biogenesis of the T4S system, two
terminal assemblies
take place—the pilus polymerization and the formation of an
active translocation channel. Mutational studies have been carried
out for the A. tumefaciens VirB10 protein
(AtVirB10) to understand domain requirements that
support these terminal structures—substrate transport (Tra)
and pilus biogenesis (Pil).7,14−16 T4S systems lacking surface-exposed features such as the TraC/VirB5
pilus tip or deletion of the OMCC cap (deletion of the AP between
residues 282–335 in AtVirB10 or 307–355
in TraF) revealed a phenotype with no discernible pilus but supported
substrate release including pilin monomers, uncoupling the two functions—substrate
secretion and pilus assembly (Tra+ Pil–).7 The α2 helix and α3 helix
and not the APL are important for pilus biogenesis. A gating defect
mutation (G272R)15 was identified that
also blocked pilus biogenesis but did not affect substrate transfer
to target cells. This mutation also rendered VirB10 unresponsive to
the cellular energy state, adopting the alternative protease-susceptible
conformation even in the energy-depleted state, allowing the unregulated
release of VirE2, independent of host cell contact. This gating defect
mutation also increased the sensitivity of the mutant to vancomycin
and SDS but no leakage of periplasmic components. Some of the other
mutations that attenuated substrate transfer but not pilus biogenesis
(Traatt Pil+) included a V243C mutation in one
of the loops close to the groove in the splayed β-barrel, Q295C
in the α2 helix, N218C in the flap toward the base of the barrel,
and T173C in the 310 α-helix connecting the base
of the barrel to the extended arm.14 The
C-terminal end of VirB10 (CT) has a conserved RDLDF motif, deletion
of which abrogates both functions (Tra– Pil–).7,14

In an attempt to visualize
the structural transitions that VirB10CTD might adopt in
the O-layer to support secretion and/or
pilus biogenesis, we embarked on an unbiased molecular dynamics study
to compare the dynamics of the wild-type VirB10CTD protein
with the constitutively open-secretion competent conformation adopted
by the ATP-insensitive gating defect mutant. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first time that long-timescale molecular dynamics has
been employed to study the conformational dynamics of the outer membrane
protein oligomers in bacterial secretion systems, including the T4S
system. This is mainly due to the computational challenges posed by
the large oligomeric states of the outer membrane proteins (14-mer
in T4S system). This would be one of the first studies to simulate
the 328 kDa outer membrane protein oligomer in a lipid bilayer to
trap the conformational states otherwise difficult to visualize in
experimental techniques. Differences between the wild-type VirB10CTD oligomer and the gating defect ATP-insensitive mutant G272R
VirB10CTD oligomer could highlight regions important for
coordinating the ATP state sensed by VirB10 in the OMC and for supporting
the different terminal structures for secretion and pilus biogenesis.

We have successfully modeled the A. tumefaciens VirB10CTD tetradecamer in the outer membrane complex
using the pKM101 OMC structure as the template. We chose to simulate
the A. tumefaciens VirB10 to correlate
with the mutation studies directly. We also built the APL loop that
was cleaved in the crystal structure between the two-helix bundle,
one of which spans the outer membrane. We used the EM structure as
a reference for guidance and docked the outer membrane complex by
guiding the loop in the extra density. Some of the extra density also
is contributed by the detergent micelles.

Results
Modeling of
Wild Type (wt-AtVirB10CTD) and G272R Mutant
(mt-AtVirB10CTD)
E. coli conjugation plasmid pKM101-encoded
TraF and A. tumefaciens VirB10 (AtVirB10) sequences share 40% sequence
identity. The homology model of wt-AtVirB10CTD was generated in two steps: first by aligning the E. coli TraF/VirB10CTD and AtVirB10CTD sequences followed by extracting structural
features from the E. coli TraF/VirB10CTD template (PDB ID 3JQO). The model (Figure 1) was generated and the loop between α2 and α3
helices in the antenna projection, which was missing in the high-resolution
structures of OMC, was built and refined to fit the OMCC nsEM structure.6 Each VirB10CTD has an N-terminal extended
arm followed by a 7-stranded β-barrel and an antenna projection
made up of a helix–loop–helix motif jutting out from
the barrel to form the outer membrane pore. The β-barrel is
atypical as it is splayed open at the base and has loops between β
strands bulging out into the inter-subunit interface. We refer to
these loops as L1 (between β1 and β2 strands: residues
192–201), L2 (between β3 and β4 strands: residues
231–246), L3 (between β6a and β6b strands that
lead to α2 OM-TM helix (residues 266–275)), and a flap
region between β2b and β3a (residues 210–220) (Figure 1C, secondary structure
labels are in accordance with the pKM101 OMC structure (3JQO)10). The L3 loop features the conserved GxxGxxG (G269xxG272xxG275
in AtVirB10CTD) motif in the VirB10 protein. The tetradecameric model
was generated with symmetry operation switched on, and the final Cα
RMSD between the template and the model was 0.68 Å. The mt-AtVirB10CTD tetradecamer was modeled by mutating
G272 to R272 in the wt-AtVirB10CTD tetradecamer
using an in silico site-directed mutagenesis method implemented in
the ICM-Pro suite. The calculated free energy change in protein stability
showed a decrease in ΔΔG value (−0.4),
suggesting that the mutation at this position was tolerated and did
not destabilize the protein fold.

Structural Variations between wt-AtVirB10CTD and mt-AtVirB10CTD
Molecular
dynamics simulation for 1 μs of both wt-AtVirB10CTD and mt-AtVirB10CTD indicated
stable dynamic systems (Figure 2). The N-terminal end of VirB10CTD in the O-layer
of the OMCC is quite flexible with an N-terminal
extended arm that wraps around neighboring subunits and then continues
into the I-layer proline-rich domain. Although the N-terminal arm
has some role to play in the stability of the oligomer, its functional
relevance for both translocation channel and pilus biogenesis is dispensable
in mutational studies.7 Due to the flexibility
of the extended arm and it not being the main focus of our study,
it was eliminated from further analysis. The residues analyzed ranged
from 179–359. The individual monomers in both wt-AtVirB10CTD and mt-AtVirB10CTD showed similar motions in the simulation run. A Cα RMSD plot
for the individual subunits showed more significant deviation from
the starting structure for wt-AtVirB10CTD (4.0 Å) than for mt-AtVirB10CTD (2.2 Å) (Figure 2A). The RMSDev plot showed RMS coordinate deviations across the backbone
for both wt-AtVirB10CTD and mt-AtVirB10CTD with maximum deviation seen in the
AP loop in both the wild type and G272R mutant. Deviations in the
loops bulging from the β-barrel including L1, L2, L3, and the
flap region are more in the wild-type than in the mutant protein,
which appears to be quite rigid (Figure 2B). The RMSF plot (Figure 2C) also showed fluctuations of backbone atoms
for all the chains of wt-AtVirB10CTD and
mt-AtVirB10CTD with maximum fluctuations
seen in the extracellular loop in the AP between α2 and α3
helices, which is flexible and missing in the high-resolution structures
of the OMC. Peaks in fluctuation can also be noted in the regions
surrounding the loops L1, L2, and L3, which are more pronounced in
wt-AtVirB10CTD, consistent with the RMSDev
plots. The G272 in wt-AtVirB10CTD showed
marked fluctuations compared to R272 in mt-AtVirB10CTD, which is stabilized by a salt bridge it forms with the
D240 residue in the L2 loop and interacts with S199 of the L1 loop
from the neighboring subunit (Figure 5, lower panel). These interactions restrict the loop
movements, supporting a more rigid conformation for mt-AtVirB10CTD compared to wt-AtVirB10CTD (Movies S1 and S2).

wild type
(wt-AtVirB10CTD) and G272R mutant (mt-AtVirB10CTD). (A) Time-dependent root-mean-square
deviation (RMSD); (B) root-mean-square deviation (RMSDev) of each
residue; (C) dynamical flexibility was characterized with RMSF with
the slowest 10 modes (RMSF10). RMSF10 provides
better estimates of the intrinsic flexibility of the protein compared
to all motions. Faster motions are noisy and depend on temperature,
while slower motions are characteristic of protein architecture and
sequence. (D) Comparison of dynamical flexibility of loops 1, 2, and
3 between wild type and G272R. Results are shown for individual monomer
A (red curves) and an average of all 14 monomers (black curves). The
dotted lines in A, B, and C represent RMSD, RMSDev per residue, and
RMSF of each individual monomer, respectively, whereas the bold line
is the average of all the subunits.

The aggregated root-mean-square fluctuations for the top 10 quasi-harmonic
modes (RMSF10) were used to characterize protein flexibility.
It is well known that the slowest 10 modes contribute to the majority
of fluctuations in proteins (>80%) and the use of RMSF10, instead of all modes, removes the faster stochastic motions of
the protein, allowing focus on intrinsic dynamics of proteins.17 The single mutation G272R causes significant
changes in conformational/dynamical flexibility of the entire complex,
particularly for loop L2 and loop L3. Figure 2D shows that the dynamical flexibility is
changed for the mutant for all three loops. For loop L2 (Figure 2D: top-right panel),
the averaged dynamical flexibility for all 14 monomers is the highest
in the region 236–239, which is decreased due to a single mutation
in loop L3. For a monomer, the dynamical flexibility is slightly decreased
for the entire loop L2. The results are also similar for loop L3 (Figure 2D: bottom panel).
However, the case for loop L1 is reversed (Figure 2D: top-left panel) as the mutant is slightly
more flexible than the wild type.

Pore Analysis of wt-AtVirB10CTD and
mt-AtVirB10CTD
Changes in the
physical dimensions of the pore in both wt-AtVirB10CTD and mt-AtVirB10CTD were calculated
from the MD trajectory. A time-averaged pore radius profile was constructed
and then compared to determine the changes brought about as a result
of the mutation over the course of the simulation. The mutant appears
to exhibit far less structural variation throughout the trajectory
(Figure 3). The minimum
pore radius decreases from 8–14 Å in wt-AtVirB10CTD to 6.5–7.5 Å in mt-AtVirB10CTD. The variability in the pore dimensions for
wt-AtVirB10CTD is the largest in the region
between the barrel and AP domains under the inner leaflet of the OM
and then the AP loop between α2 and α3. The loop L2 wherein
the D240 and a conserved R242 residue exist is situated just under
the inner leaflet of the OM and exposed to the interior of the VirB10
channel in the OMC. Any variations in this loop can affect the pore
dynamics. The loop L3 where the G272 residue resides continues toward
the α2 OM-TM followed by a short β6b strand. mt-AtVirB10CTD locks the L2 and L3 loops due to
salt bridge D240:R272, thereby affecting L2 loop flexibility, locking
the mutant oligomer in a rigid conformation. However, in both conformations,
there was no barrier to permeation of water and ions anywhere along
the pore.

simulation time are illustrated as dots and colored based on their
hydrophobicity. (iii) Dynamic radius profile highlights the variation
in pore dimensions over the course of the simulation. The pore is

pore radius over simulated time highlights stabilization of the pore
in the mutant when compared with the wild type.

Direct Domain Correlations in wt-AtVirB10CTD and mt-AtVirB10CTD
Average
dynamical cross-correlation maps (DCCMs) were calculated
for wt-AtVirB10CTD and mt-AtVirB10CTD for comparison. A comparison of DCCMs between
various subunits of wt-AtVirB10CTD and
mt-AtVirB10CTD after 500 ns and 1 μs
of simulation showed very little variation, suggesting that the correlations
based on 1 μs of trajectories are well converged. Figure 4A,B compares the DCCM for wt-AtVirB10CTD and mt-AtVirB10CTD with a schematic of the structural features of VirB10CTD aligned below. The single mutation (G272R) causes dynamical
cross-correlations to be changed across the entire monomer in mt-AtVirB10CTD. Positive correlations (values closer
to 1) imply that residues move together in the same direction, and
large negative correlations (values closer to −1) imply that
residues are correlated but they move in the opposite direction. Intermediate
values (closer to 0) indicate that the residues are not dynamically
correlated. The wild-type protein shows significant positive correlations
throughout the protein (Figure 4A), which are drastically reduced for the G272R mutant (Figure 4B).

Figure 4 Comparison of dynamical
cross-correlation maps for wt-AtVirB10CTD and mt-AtVirB10CTD: (A) Wild-type monomer
and (B) G272R monomer. (C) Comparison of
correlations between regions 232–246 and 265–273 in
wt-AtVirB10CTD and (D) comparison of correlations
between regions 232–246 and 265–273 in mt-AtVirB10CTD. White ellipses in (A) and (B) mark the regions
of correlations between loops 1, 2, and 3, and the site of mutation
is marked by a black vertical line. Note that the maps in (A) and
(B) are symmetric. The red regions show positive correlations, and
blue regions are negative. From wild type to mutant, the biggest changes
are in the disappearance of several positively correlated areas. Network
analysis for (E) wild type and (F) mutant calculated over three adjacent
subunits. The analysis focused on the effective signal transmission
between two ends of the subunit. In the wild type, the community interactions
are limited to within the subunits, and at no point, the shortest
path passes via G272. In the mutant, there is significant repartitioning
of the network. The shortest path runs through the R272–D240
ion pair interaction adopting both, intra- and inter-subunit routes.

In the wild-type protein, notable positive correlation
is observed
between the loops L1, L2, and L3 and the C-terminal (CT) region beyond
the AP loop including the α3 helix of the two-helix bundle in
the OM and the β7c strand that features the conserved motif
R353DLDF3577,14 important
for T4S system function. There is a weak negative coupling of domain
movements of the loops L1, L2, and L3 with the α2 helix that
forms the TM helix in the OM. However, analysis of the DCCM for mt-AtVirB10CTD has a different correlation pattern.
In particular, the correlations between regions 232–246 and
265–273 show remarkable differences (Figure 4C,D). These regions show strongly positively
correlated motions in the wild-type protein, which disappears completely
with the mutation. However, an area showing an increase in negative
correlation emerges with the mutation. Overall, these results indicate
that the single mutation causes significant changes in the dynamical
flexibility of loops L2 and L3 and dynamical correlations of residues
across the entire protein. The different correlation patterns in the
two simulations suggest the loops and CT domain are more strongly
coupled in wt-AtVirB10CTD, thereby being
able to respond to the cellular signals compared to mt-AtVirB10CTD that has different local dynamics between the
loops with some negative correlation that might affect response to
intracellular signals.

Network Analysis
Dynamical network
analysis has been
used to describe correlated and/or anticorrelated residue motions
in order to identify possible communication pathways between different
parts of biomolecular complexes. This method has been successfully
applied to study the allosteric coupling between tRNA–protein
complexes,18 M2 muscarinic receptors,19 cysteinyl tRNA synthetase,20 GPCRs,21 and long-range signaling
in very large multisubunit complexes of the MutS component of the
methyl-directed DNA mismatch repair system.22 MD simulation analysis revealed large-scale conformational changes
in wt-AtVirB10CTD, while the G272R mutation
in mt-AtVirB10CTD restricts these movements.
The lateral distance between extreme ends of a monomer between the
AP loop residue (G309) at the extracellular end and a residue at the
base of the barrel (T216) is 101 Å with residue G272R positioned
∼30 Å from T216. The lockdown of the conformational dynamics
as a result of G272R mutation suggested that communication in this
system takes place via changes in the local dynamics rather than an
induced mechanism. Since AtVirB10CTD is
an extremely large protein complex, dynamical networks would be employed
to transmit information via pathways connecting residue pairs along
the shortest path with the highest pairwise local correlations. We
focused our analysis on the functionally most relevant signal propagation
between two ends of a subunit and whether residue 272 falls on this
effective signal transmission pathway. Previously, such analysis has
identified how single mutations can change the dynamical characteristic
of entire proteins.23 Analysis of wt-AtVirB10CTD suggested that the communities of
network are predominantly limited to interactions within the subunit
and rarely make contacts with the adjacent subunit. At no point, the
shortest path passes via G272 (Figure 4E). Mutation G272R in mt-AtVirB10CTD leads to a significant repartitioning of the dynamical
network (Figure 4F).
In the mutant, the shortest path runs through the subunit, passing
through the R272 and D240 ion pair. There are two other sets of paths
that can be identified. Of these, the major path is via the adjacent
subunit, again passing via the R272–D240 ion pair. The minor
path follows an intra-subunit route but avoids the R272–D240
ion pair interaction altogether. This variability in the pathways
observed in mt-AtVirB10CTD could be an
attribute of the rigidification of the complex arising as a result
of the lockdown of loops 2 and 3 due to the formation of the R272–D240
ion pair interaction.

Discussion
The T4S system functions
in two modes: (a) the pilus biogenesis
mode also described as a mate-seeking mode and (b) the translocation
mode for secretion also described as the mating mode.2,7 T4S systems are versatile in the diverse array of substrates they
can transport, and in the translocation mode, it has been suggested
that there could be two further conformational states—one for
transporting protein substrates that later switches to an ssDNA substrate
translocation mode in conjugation machineries.2 The inner membrane complex and the outer membrane core complex assemble
initially to form the core assembly across the cell membrane. ATPases
associate at the cytoplasmic side and power the release of a pilin–phospholipid
complex from the inner membrane to initiate pilus biogenesis within
the T4S core assembly to form the mate-seeking complex. In response
to intra and extracellular signals on host–cell contact, structural
transitions take place in the T4S assembly to switch the pilus biogenesis
assembly to a translocation or mating complex.

The VirB10 protein
provides the scaffold for the assembly of the
T4S system during biogenesis and responds to the intracellular ATP
state and substrate recruitment by undergoing a conformational change,
transmitting this information essential in both terminal functions—pilus
biogenesis and secretion. VirB10 inserts into both the inner and outer
membranes, thereby being uniquely positioned to channel information
across the inner membrane complex (IMC) and OMCC in the T4S system.
High-resolution structures of diverse outer membrane complexes from
both a conjugation system such as the E. coli pKM101 plasmid and an effector translocation system such as the X. citri and H. pylori Cag T4S system show a conserved architecture with VirB10 forming
the central channel in the outer layer of the OMCC. However, the structural
transitions that could respond to intracellular or extracellular signals
and changes in conformational dynamics required to bring about function
are poorly understood. The substrate translocation path for ssDNA
chalked out using the TrIP assay for VirB proteins that make contact
with the substrate identified VirB9 and VirB2 subunits but not VirB10
in the O-layer,12 leaving the puzzle for
what forms the translocation path in different modes unsolved. Mutation
studies to understand domain contribution of VirB10 protein to specific
functions provided the first hints toward mechanistic understanding.
Uncoupling mutations that support secretion in the absence of surface-exposed
pilus were identified that included the AP region of VirB10 (VirB10:
Δ282–335) revealing a role of the distal end of the OMCC
in regulating pilus biogenesis and a G272R mutation in the OMCC chamber
close to the AP that spans the OM. We performed extended molecular
dynamics simulations of both wt-AtVirB10CTD and G272R mt-AtVirB10CTD to capture
the structural transitions that the VirB10 CTD oligomer
can undergo and the difference that might explain the phenotype seen
in mt-AtVirB10CTD. These transitions can
point toward the structural mechanism that senses cellular signals
to bring about the switching required for various functional modes.
The ATP-insensitive open complex of mutant G272R showed a more rigid
conformation throughout the dynamic simulation run compared to the
wild-type oligomer, consistent with the lack of conformational flexibility
required for sensing the intracellular energy state. RMSDev and RMSF
plots showed maximum fluctuations in the AP loop for both wt-AtVirB10CTD and mt-AtVirB10CTD followed by noticeable deviations in the loop regions of
VirB10 in the inter-subunit interface including the L1, L2, L3, and
flap regions for wt-AtVirB10CTD. The AP
loops are extracellular and flexible in all structures of the OMC
solved so far. They can tolerate insertions and deletions for both
secretion and pilus biogenesis functions, suggesting a more structural
role for this flexible loop. This suggests that the conformational
flexibility in the loops bulging out from the barrel domain might
coordinate information in the wild-type protein to relay function
across the tetradecamer. In order to further investigate the role
of these loops, we compared the inter-subunit interface of VirB10CTD in high-resolution structures that are available for OMC
for diverse systems—conjugative plasmid pKM101 and effector
translocators—X. citri and H. pylori Cag T4S systems (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Sequence alignment of VirB10CTD shown for the conjugation
plasmid pKM101 T4S system (TraF), bacteria-killing effector translocator X. citri T4S system (VirB10), H. pylori Cag T4S system (CagY), and A. tumefaciens VirB10 using ENDscript/ESPript44 and
HMM logo for loops L1, L2, and L3 displayed below the sequence using
Skylign.45 The lower panel shows the conserved
salt bridge triad in the inter-subunit interface for the above three
systems and the corresponding salt bridge triad in the wild-type A. tumefaciens VirB10CTD oligomer (R242:D197:R270).
Also shown for the wild type are other interacting residues involved
in switching ionic interactions in the mutant G272R VirB10CTD. Loops L1 in blue, L2 in red, and L3 in yellow, and conserved G272
and corresponding middle Gly in the GxxGxxG motif in loop L3 are shown
as spheres.

What is striking in all known
structures is a conserved salt bridge
triad in the inter-subunit interface formed between L2 and L3 loops
of one subunit with the L1 loop of the neighboring subunit. A conserved
arginine (R263 in E. coli TraF, R257
in X.citri VirB10, and R1754 in H. pylori CagY) in loop L2 forms a salt bridge with
a charged residue in the L3 loop (N288 in E. coli TraF, D281 in X. citri VirB10, and
E1783 in H. pylori CagY), which has
the conserved GxxGxxG motif supported by an ionic interaction with
a charged residue from loop L1 of a neighboring subunit (E216 in E. coli TraF, R211 in X. citri VirB10, and K1705 in H. pylori CagY).

The equilibrium model of the wild-type VirB10CTD tetradecamer
from A. tumefaciens and the structures
at the end of 500 ns and 1 μs simulation show a similar salt
bridge triad coordinated by the corresponding conserved arginine R242
in loop L2 with R270 in the loop L3 and D197 in loop L1 of the neighboring
subunit. The salt bridge triad can coordinate the movements of these
loops, consistent with the positive correlations noted for these loops
in the DCCM maps. Although no mutations of the residues in this triad
have been carried out previously, mutation of V243C in the L2 loop
attenuated substrate secretion, suggesting a role for this loop in
T4S function. The DCCM data also showed the coupling of the loops
with the C-terminal region beyond the AP loops, including the conserved
R353DLDF357 region, which has been shown to
be essential for both secretion and pilus biogenesis. The conserved
RDLDF region and the flap region are in close proximity to the L1,
L2, and L3 loop salt bridge triad in the inter-subunit interface (Figure 1C).

Equilibrium
structures for G272R mt-AtVirB10CTD at
500 ns and 1 μs simulation run time reveal a repositioning
of the ionic interactions between the loops affecting their local
dynamics (Figure 5).
The G272R mutation disrupts the conserved salt bridge formed between
R242 with loop L3 and loop L1. Instead, the R272 in loop L3 forms
a salt bridge with D240 in loop L2 changing the interloop dynamics.
This interaction is further supported by S199 and D197 interactions
in loop L1 of the neighboring subunit. Loop L3 is locked down toward
the barrel by interactions between R270 with D266 and E267, further
affecting the dynamics of this loop. DCCM maps for G272R mt-AtVirB10CTD show the disappearance of the positive
correlation between L2 and L3 loops and instead show the emergence
of a negative correlation in the region surrounding R270 in loop L3
and R242 in loop L2, uncoupling these loops in the mutant. Analysis
of intrinsic dynamics using aggregated root-mean-square fluctuations
for the top 10 quasi-harmonic modes (RMSF10) also showed
significant changes in conformational flexibility of loops L2 and
L3 in G272R mt-AtVirB10CTD and slightly
increased flexibility in loop L1, in contrast to the wild-type protein.
Reduced flexibility in loops L2 and L3 and uncoupling between the
L1, L2, and L3 loops lead to the rigidification of the entire VirB10CTD oligomer in the mutant.

We employed network analysis
to identify the changes in the communication
pathway in the wild type versus G272R mutant to understand how the
swapping of electrostatic interactions between the loops affects the
local dynamics leading to large-scale changes in conformational flexibility.
We looked for the shortest communication path with the highest pairwise
correlation between the extracellular APL loop to the periplasmic
end facing the cytoplasm at the base of the O-layer for the extremely
large AtVirB10CTD protein complex and
looked for loop L3 that features the conserved GxxG272xxG
motif in this path. At no point did the shortest path in wt-AtVirB10CTD pass through G272, and the communities
of networks were limited to intra-subunit interactions. However, mt-AtVirB10CTD features the R272–D240 ion
pair in its shortest communication path with a few alternate paths
through neighboring subunits. The different dynamic pathways in the
wild-type and mutant proteins suggest that the conformational switching
in the VirB10 oligomer is brought about by changes in local dynamics
rather than induced mechanisms.

The VirB10 protein in the T4S
channel needs to undergo a conformational
switch in response to intracellular and extracellular signals to switch
the assembly from pilus biogenesis to the secretion mode. Uncoupling
mutations have shown that secretion can take place in the absence
of a substrate-exposed pilus, although pilin monomers are expressed.
Our studies suggest that this conformational switch is regulated by
the local dynamics employed between the loops bulging from the atypical
β-barrel and any local changes can cause large-scale conformational
changes as seen in the G272R mutant dynamics. The swapping of the
electrostatic ion pairs between the loops L1, L2, and L3 can affect
local dynamics sufficient to change the communication paths across
the complex and detach the communication link between the various
regions of the VirB10 protein. This disengagement leads to the rigidification
of the mutant protein, making it unable to respond to intracellular
signals required for T4S function. However, in situ, where many other
proteins, signaling molecules, and host factors are present, an induced
mechanism (or a combination of both) could also drive VirB10 conformational
switching.

Computational Methods
Since there is no high-resolution
structure of VirB10 from A. tumefaciens, we constructed a homology model based
on the E. coli plasmid pKM101 TraF/VirB10
structure as a template. The crystal structure of the E. coli outer membrane complex of a type IV secretion
(T4S) system was downloaded from Protein Data Bank (PDB ID3JQO). The E. coli T4S system OMC structure is a complex of
three proteins, namely VirB7, VirB9CTD, and VirB10CTD. From the complex, the coordinates of VirB7 and VirB9 were
removed, and only VirB10CTD was used for further studies.
The core of VirB10CTD comprises 14 symmetric subunits,
each comprising an N-terminal arm, a 7-sheet atypical β-barrel,
and two helices—α2 and α3. There is a 23 amino
acid loop that connects α2 and α3 helices, which is missing
from the E. coli VirB10 crystal structure.

Modeling
The sequence of A. tumefaciens VirB10
was downloaded from UniProt (P05359) and aligned with the E. coli pKM101 TraF/VirB10 using Clustal Omega.24 The homology model was built based on a 40%
sequence identity over 217 residues with E. coli TraF/VirB10. The 23 residues between α2 and α3 helices
were built as a loop. The model was generated using Modeller v9.2125 with symmetry operation switched on to generate
a tetradecameric assembly. This enables each subunit to be an exact
copy of the others. The loop between α2 and α3 was refined
until a conformation was obtained, which was able to fit the electron
density maps of the OMCC EM structures.6,26 The stereochemical
parameters were checked using PROCHECK27 and PROSA.28 The final model was chosen
based on the low-energy function and low Cα RMSD overlap between
the template and the model. Several rounds of minimization were performed
to relieve any steric clashes between the side chains. The final Cα
between the template and the model was 0.68 Å.

The central
cavity running through the core of the protein was hydrated via the
use of a grid-based cavity solvation method as implemented in VOIDOO
and FLOOD,29 resulting in a total of 100
initial pore water molecules. The model and the pore waters were then
imported in the Schrodinger Maestro suite for pre-processing and protonation
state assignment using the protein preparation wizard. The Orientation
of Proteins in Membrane (OPM) database was used to identify the spatial
arrangement of VirB10 with respect to a preformed dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine
(DMPC) lipid bilayer. The DMPC bilayer was chosen as it represented
a bacterial model bilayer. A system builder was used to embed the
protein in the bilayer, and solvent was placed at either ends. The
system was neutralized using counterions, which were added by replacing
the solvent molecules. Amberff99SB-ILDN30 was used to describe the protein interactions in the system, with
explicit TIP3P water molecules. The final system was a simulation
cell consisting of 3038 protein residues, 738 DMPC lipids, 84,301
water molecules, and 70 counterions, totaling 385,570 atoms in a box
of size 160 × 160 × 130 Å3.

Simulations
The simulations were run using Desmond3.6.31 A 50 ns NPT equilibration was
carried out followed by 1 μs of production run using the NVT ensemble. Production simulations were initiated from
the final snapshot of the corresponding equilibration simulation.
All bond lengths of hydrogen atoms were constrained using M-SHAKE.32 An r-RESPA integrator was used with a time step
of 2 fs for the short-range bonded and non-bonded interactions, and
long-range non-bonded interactions were computed every 6 fs.33 The mutant VirB10 was generated by replacing
Gly272 with Arg272, and ΔΔG calculated using an in silico
site directed mutagenesis method as implemented in ICM-Pro suite.34 The mutant VirB10 system was simulated using
the same protocol as the wild type. The simulations were run in parallel
on a single GPU 1080Ti workstation at a rate of ∼15 ns/day.

Analysis
To reduce the noise from the simulations,
the incomplete N-terminal arm was trimmed by removing the first 29
residues, resulting in the VirB10 core retaining 200–386 residues.
VirB10 exhibits tetradecameric symmetry; thus, we used three consecutive
subunits (A B C) for further analysis. The simulations were analyzed
using the VMD suite and the Gromacs suite, while the structural figures
were generated using VMD, ICM-Pro, and PyMol software.34−36

Hole Plot
The time-dependent behavior of the pore was
calculated using the channel annotation package CHAP (www.channotation.org).37 The trajectories were aligned along the z axis following which each frame is then analyzed using
the CHAP program. The program calculates summary statistics (mean,
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) over time for each point
in the pore profile. The s coordinate follows the
pathway of the pore. CHAP calculates the hydrophobicity profile according
to a scale proposed by Wimley and White38 and rescales between −1 (hydrophilic) to +1 (hydrophobic).
The pores were visualized using VMD software.35

RMSF10 Calculations for Protein Flexibility/Dynamics
The aggregated root-mean-square fluctuations for the top 10 quasi-harmonic
modes (RMSF10) were used to characterize protein flexibility.
It is well known that the slowest 10 modes contribute to the majority
of fluctuations in proteins (>80%) and the use of RMSF10, instead of all modes, removes the faster stochastic motions of
the protein, allowing focus on intrinsic dynamics of proteins.17 These calculations were performed using the ptraj analysis program.39 As
a full protein oligomer comprises over 3000 protein residues, for
computational reasons, the quasi-harmonic analysis was performed for
three monomers at a time (monomer and its two adjoining neighbors).
The results for all 14 sets of trimers were collected. For each calculation,
2001 frames from MD simulations were used, and the coordinates were
aligned to the first frame to remove rotation and translation before
the calculation.

Dynamic Cross-correlation Matrix (DCCM)
The dynamic
cross-correlations for Cα–Cα were calculated using the ptraj analysis program.39 These calculations were also performed for a
set of trimers in a similar way to RMSF10 calculations,
and the results were plotted and visualized using MATLAB (www.mathworks.com).

Network Analysis
Communication networks within the
wild type and the mutant were identified using NetworkView.18,40 The trajectories from the molecular dynamics simulations were used
to construct the dynamic networks. The system was simplified by representing
each residue as a single Cα node. A local contact matrix was
generated after extracting all conformations from a simulation run.
Two nodes (excluding neighboring nodes) are in contact if they are
within a distance of 4.5 Å for more than 75% of the simulation
time. The interdependence between nodes is weighted by correlation
and represented as a connecting edge. The dynamic cross-correlational
maps (DCCM) generated have the ability to identify highly correlated
or anticorrelated nodes. However, to compute communication pathways,
it is useful to construct a matrix (C) where small values
indicate highly correlated or anticorrelated motions. This can be
functionalized by wij = −log(|Cij|) where wij can
be thought of as a distance in the functionalized correlation space
between node–node pairs i and j. The DCC maps for network analysis were calculated using the program
Carma.41 The shortest (optimal) path between
two nodes was obtained using the Floyd–Warshall algorithm.42 The number of optimal paths that cross one edge
is termed as betweenness of the edge (node). The length of a path
is the sum of the edge weights between the consecutive nodes along
this path. Suboptimal paths within a certain limit (offset) between
the two nodes were also determined in addition to the optimal path.
The number of suboptimal paths shows the path degeneracy. Communities
or disjoined subnetworks were calculated using the Girvan–Newman
algorithm43 where nodes have stronger and
more connections to other nodes within the same community than they
have to those outside the community.
