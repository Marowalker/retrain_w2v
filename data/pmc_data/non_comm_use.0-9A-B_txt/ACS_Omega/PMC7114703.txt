In this study, controlled synthesis
of hollow mesoporous silica
nanoreactors with small manganese oxide nanoparticles in their cavities
(MnxOy@HMSNs)
is reported, and the dye degradation performance in the presence of
hydrogen peroxide over MnxOy@HMSNs is investigated. Specifically, triple ligands
(a compound with three dipicolinic acid groups) were used to coordinate
manganese ions to form negatively charged coordination complex networks,
which further combine with positively charged copolymers to obtain
metal ion-containing polymer micelles. Following silica deposition
onto micellar coronas and calcinations simultaneously result in hollow
mesoporous silica nanoreactors and manganese oxide nanoparticles in
their cavities. In this work, the influences of synthetic parameters
on the structures are studied in detail. The obtained MnxOy@HMSNs show greatly
enhanced activity and stability for a series of dye degradations.
The performance enhancement is ascribed to their unique nanostructures,
where mesoporous silica walls provide protection to the inner MnxOy nanoparticles
and the small size of the manganese oxide nanoparticles greatly enhances
the dye degradation activity.

1 Introduction
Hollow
porous silica nanoreactors are well recognized as potential
materials for drug delivery and energy storage because of their good
thermal stability and environmental friendliness.1−6 Especially, hollow mesoporous silica nanoreactors (HMSNs) with small
metal or metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) inside their hollow cavities
(M@HMSNs or MxOy@HMSNs) are considered as catalytic nanoreactors for various heterogeneous
reactions,7−11 where mesoporous silica walls provide protection to the inner NPs
with fast mass transportation, and the residence of small NPs inside
hollow cavities prevent the inner NPs from leaching into the solution.

Besides the template-free synthetic methods for hollow nanospheres,12−16 the traditional templated methods to prepare M@HMSNs or MxOy@HMSNs either
start with the metal or metal oxide NPs in microemulsion droplets,17−21 onto which silica is deposited, or load functional NPs into presynthesized
hollow silica nanoreactors.2,17−25 Although these two methods have achieved great progress, synthesis
of HMSNs with small NPs (<2 nm) inside their cavities is still
challenging,7,11,20,26−28 in which the small size
of functional NPs is crucial to obtain high catalytic efficiency by
the maximum usage of active atoms.

Herein, we report a new synthetic
method to simultaneously obtain
hollow mesoporous silica nanoreactors and small MnxOy NPs (∼1.6 nm) in their
hollow cavities (MnxOy@HMSNs). The influences of synthetic parameters on their
structures and reaction conditions on dye degradations are also studied
in this work. In the synthesis, triple ligands instead of our previous
reported double ligands29,30 are used to coordinate
Mn ions to form negatively charged coordination complex networks,
and the resulting negatively charged complex networks further combine
with positively charged quaternized poly(2-vinylpyridine)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (P2MVP128-b-PEO477) copolymers to form metal ion bound polymer micelles.
After silica deposition onto micellar coronas and subsequent calcination,
HMSNs (∼30 nm) with ∼1.6 nm MnxOy NPs inside their cavities (∼15
nm) are obtained. Scheme 1 shows the representative synthetic procedure for MnxOy@HMSNs. The MnxOy@HMSNs display
greatly enhanced dye degradation performance relative to supported
MnxOy/SiO2, and the enhancement is ascribed to the unique nanostructures
of HMSNs with small NPs inside their cavities.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
of MnxOy@HMSNs
To synthesize HMSNs with MnxOy NPs inside their cavities, the key process
is to form Mn ion bound polymer micelles. By mixing their corresponding
Mn2+, L3 ligand, and positively charged copolymer
aqueous solutions, Mn ion-containing micelles are obtained. As shown
in Scheme 1, one Mn2+ ion will coordinate with four carboxylate groups, resulting
in two net negative charges for each coordination center. Since one
L3 molecule, a compound with three dipicolinic acid groups
grafted on a benzene ring,31 has six carboxylate
groups, the molar ratio of Mn/L3 is set to 1.5/1.0. Each
quaternized P2MVP128-b-PEO477 molecule (level of quaternization is ∼90%) will roughly have
∼115 positive charges. To keep charge balance, the ratio of
polymer/L3/Mn should be set to 1/38.3/57.5 to obtain stable
micelles. Following silica deposition through the hydrolysis of tetramethyl
orthosilicate (TMOS) and calcination will give MnxOy@HMSNs. During the synthesis,
other synthetic parameters such as pH values, TMOS/Mn ratios, and
calcination temperatures are also required to be controlled to obtain
small MnxOy NP integrated hollow mesoporous silica nanoreactors.

Figure 1 demonstrates transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images, high-angle annular dark-field scanning
transition electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images, X-ray diffraction
(XRD), and energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) studies of MnxOy@HMSNs synthesized
at a pH value of 4.5, 180/1 of TMOS/Mn, and 400 °C calcination,
while their corresponding size distributions are presented in Figure S1. As shown in Figure 1a, small NPs inside hollow cavities can be
observed in TEM images. Due to a better contrast between silica and
MnxOy in the
dark-field model, the structures of hollow silica nanospheres with
small NPs inside their cavities are more clearly illustrated in Figure 1b. The size distributions
in Figure S1 reveal that the MnxOy@HMSNs have a
whole size of ∼29.2 nm with ∼15.4 nm hollow cavities,
and the size of inner NPs is ∼1.6 nm. Although the XRD patterns
of MnxOy@HMSNs
in Figure 1c only show
SiO2 diffractions (around 22.0 2θ°), the EDS
measurement in Figure 1d confirms the presence of Mn elements in HMSNs, suggesting the formation
of amorphous MnxOy due to high dispersion. It is concluded that MnxOy@HMSNs have the nanostructures
of hollow silica nanospheres with small MnxOy NPs inside their cavities.

°C calcination. (a) TEM image; (b) HAADF-STEM image; (c) XRD
patterns; and (d) EDS measurement. Scale bars are 50 nm.

TEM images of MnxOy@HMSNs synthesized at different pH values are presented
in Figure 2. The materials
synthesized at a pH value of 3.0 (Figure 2a) do not exhibit hollow nanostructures,
indicating the nonexistence of Mn ion bound polymer micelles. At such
a low pH value, L3 molecules will be protonated as the
carboxylic acid, which decreases their coordination with Mn2+ ions. As shown in Figure 2b–e, hollow nanospheres with small MnxOy NPs inside cavities can be
obtained at a suitable pH range from 4.0 to 8.0. When the pH value
reaches 8.5 (Figure 2f), hollow nanospheres are no longer observed. Although L3 molecules are fully deprotonated at such a high pH value of 8.5,
most Mn ions precipitate as metal hydroxides, prohibiting the formation
of Mn ion bound micelles. The suitable pH range for the formation
of metal ion-containing polymer micelles by triple ligands is wider
than that by double ligands29,30 because triple ligands
can form coordination complex networks, which further increases the
coordination stability between L3 and metal ions, resulting
in a wider pH range for micelles formation.

Figure 2 TEM images of MnxOy@HMSNs synthesized
at a pH value of (a) 3.0; (b) 4.0; (c)
4.5; (d) 6.5; (e) 8.0; and (f) 8.5. Scale bars are 50 nm. The molar
ratios of TMOS/Mn for all of the materials are 180/1, and the calcination
temperature is 400 °C.

Figure 3 shows Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of MnxOy@HMPSNs calcined at different temperatures,
while Figure S2 demonstrates thermogravimetric/differential
thermal analysis (TG/DTA) studies of MnxOy@HMSNs (before calcination). As shown
in Figure S2, an inflection is observed
at 425 °C, which is ascribed to the removal of ligands and polymers.
A series of peaks from 1320 to 1550 cm–1 of the
samples without calcination (black pattern) in Figure 3 are indexed to the in-plane bending vibrations
of C–H bonds,32−34 while those at 1650 and 2920 cm–1 are ascribed to the asymmetric stretching vibrations of carboxylic
groups of ligands and methylene groups of the polymer, respectively.33−36 After calcination at 400 °C, all the abovementioned peaks disappear
in the red pattern in Figure 3, indicating the complete removal of organic materials by
calcination at 400 °C for 3.0 h. Further increasing calcination
temperatures results in similar spectra, once again confirming the
complete removal of organic materials. Although TG/DTA studies suggest
an inflection temperature at 425 °C, the calcination at 400 °C
for 3.0 h can completely remove ligands and polymers to obtain hollow
mesoporous nanostructures, as suggested in FT-IR studies.

Figure 3 FT-IR spectra
of MnxOy@HMSNs
before or after calcination at various temperatures.
The sample was prepared at a TMOS/Mn ratio of 180/1 and a pH value
of 4.5.

TEM images of MnxOy@HMSNs before or after calcination
are illustrated in Figure 4. MnxOy@HMSNs without calcination
demonstrate connected solid nanospheres in Figure 4a, while those calcined at 400–900
°C (Figure 4b–e)
show distinct hollow nanospheres with MnxOy NPs inside their cavities. During
this process, the whole particles decrease from ∼45.7 nm of
the precursors in Figure 4a to ∼29.2 nm of MnxOy@HMSNs calcined at 400 °C in Figure 4b, apparently due to the particle
shrinkage by thermal treatment. With the calcination temperature increasing
from 400 to 900 °C, a transition from porous materials in the
inset of Figure 4b
to more dense materials in the inset of Figure 4e can be observed, suggesting the collapse
of pores in the silica walls. When the calcination temperature increases
to 1000 °C, solid silica with a smooth and dense appearance is
observed in Figure 4f, certainly due to the collapse of hollow cavities.

Figure 4 TEM images of MnxOy@HMSNs calcined
at different temperatures: (a) without calcination;
(b) 400 °C; (c) 600 °C; (d) 700 °C; (e) 900 °C;
and (f) 1000 °C. Scale bars: 50 nm; scale bars in the insets:
20 nm. All samples were synthesized at a ratio of TMOS/Mn of 180/1
and a pH value of 4.5.

To control the silica
wall thickness, molar ratios of TMOS/Mn in
the synthesis were investigated. Figure 5 and Table 1 present TEM images and the real Si/Mn ratios of MnxOy@HMSNs synthesized
at different TMOS/Mn ratios, respectively, while their corresponding
size distributions are shown in Figure S3. As confirmed by Figure 5, all materials have similar hollow nanostructures. Table 1 reveals that with
TMOS/Mn ratios increasing from 90/1 (Figure 5a) to 300/1 (Figure 5f), the whole size increases from 24.2 to
33.7 nm, accompanied by a wall thickness from 4.5 to 8.5 nm. When
TMOS/Mn ratios increase from 90/1 to 300/1, the real Si/Mn ratios
increase from 47/1 to 198/1. Overall, the real ratios of Si/Mn are
approximately half of the starting TMOS/Mn ratios. TMOS hydrolysis
at a pH value of 4.5 is slow and requires >4 days to collect solids
for calcination. Silica containing metal ion bound micelles will precipitate
due to their high densities while those partially hydrolyzed and not
fully polymerized remain in the solution and will be separated from
the metal-containing solids by centrifugation, resulting in smaller
real Si/Mn ratios in HMSNs.

N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size
distributions of various MnxOy@HMSNs synthesized at different conditions are presented
in Figure 6. As demonstrated
in Figure 6a, type
IV isotherms with distinct hysteresis loops are observed for all tested
MnxOy@HMSNs,
confirming their mesoporous nanostructures.33,37−39 Moreover, the hysteresis loop of MnxOy@HMSNs calcined at 900 °C
is significantly smaller than those of materials calcined at 400 °C,
confirming the collapse of mesopores in silica walls during high-temperature
calcination. Those aggregation voids between nanospheres result in
adsorption uptakes at P/P0 ∼ 0.90, while inflections around P/P0 ∼ 0.46 in the desorption branches are
originated from the delay of N2 evaporation from hollow
voids blocked by the surrounding mesoporous walls.37−39Figure 6b presents their pore size
distributions. For those materials calcined at 400 °C, a large
percentage of pore volume is ascribed to mesopores around 9–15
nm. The pores above 20 nm in Figure 6b are indexed to the aggregation voids between nanospheres.
The literature revealed that the sizes of hollow cavities cannot be
directly obtained from pore size distributions because the N2 evaporation from hollow voids is blocked by the surrounding mesoporous
pores in the silica walls.37 Therefore,
the sizes of hollow voids of such materials can only be obtained from
the size analysis of TEM images (Figures S1 and S3).

MnxOy@HMSNs
and (b) their corresponding pore size distributions by nonlocal density
functional theory (NLDFT) method. All materials were synthesized at
a pH value of 4.5.

Table 2 presents
textural properties of various MnxOy@HMSNs. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) specific surface areas and pore volumes of these materials are
around 93–382 m2/g and 0.38–0.88 cm3/g, respectively. The average pore diameters are around 9.6–25.2
nm. Due to the increased calcination temperature, the specific surface
areas of MnxOy@HMSNs decrease from 382 m2/g with calcination at 400
°C to 93 m2/g with calcination at 900 °C, and
a similar trend is also observed for pore volumes. The significant
decrease of BET specific surface area at 900 °C is certainly
due to the collapsion of pores at such a high calcination temperature.
However, MnxOy@HMSNs calcined at such a high temperature of 900 °C still have
hollow nanostructures (Figure 4e) and their specific surface areas remain 93 m2/g, indicating their high thermal stability.

2.2 Dye Degradations over MnxOy@HMSNs
As an illustration,
degradations of a series of dyes with H2O2 are
used to demonstrate the unique catalytic properties of MnxOy@HMSNs. Methylene blue
(MB), orange II, and orange G are the main groups of dyes in wastewater,40−44 and their removal in the presence of H2O2 over
transition metal ions (Fenton process)45−49 is recognized as an efficient way to treat wastewater.
However, the classical Fenton process is typically carried out in
a narrow pH range (<4),47,49,50 and the redox metal ions require strict regulation due to their
toxicity, limiting the wide use of Fenton process in wastewater treatment.51,52 Therefore, supported transition metal oxide catalysts are highly
desired to decrease the release of metal ions to water.53,54 Among various transition metal oxides, manganese oxides are good
candidates, especially due to their low toxicity.54 It has been reported in the literature that bicarbonate
not only assists degradations of dyes with H2O2 but also maintains basic conditions needed to decrease the release
of metal ions.52 In this study, a series
of dye degradations with H2O2 with bicarbonate
were studied.

MB degradations over MnxOy@HMSNs with different ratios of Si/Mn
are shown in Figure 7 and their corresponding UV–visible spectra are shown in Figure S4. The initial MB degradation rates decrease
with the increasing TMOS/Mn ratios. As shown in Table 1, with keeping the same amount of catalysts
in each experiment, the Mn loadings decrease with the increasing TMOS/Mn
ratios. For example, the Mn loading of MnxOy@HMSNs with a TMOS/Mn ratio of 90/1
is 1.9 wt % while that of MnxOy@HMSNs with a TMOS/Mn ratio of 300/1 is 0.46
wt %. Moreover, the thickness of the silica wall also increases with
increasing TMOS/Mn ratios. Either the decrease in metal loading or
the increase in wall thickness can cause the efficiency to decrease,
resulting in the degradation efficiency decreasing with increasing
TMOS/Mn ratios. As shown in Table 1, MnxOy@HMSNs with a TMOS/Mn ratio of 120, 180, and 270 show a
significant difference of Mn loadings (1.4–0.6 wt %) with a
relatively insignificant difference of the silica wall thickness (6.4–7.5
nm), but their initial dye degradation performances are basically
the same, indicating the predominant influence of wall thickness on
degradations. Moreover, MnxOy@HMSNs with a TMOS/Mn ratio of 90/1 demonstrate the
smallest silica wall thickness but with the best degradation performance,
further confirming the significant influence of silica wall thickness.

Figure 7 MB degradations
over MnxOy@HMSNs with different TMOS/Mn ratios. Reaction conditions:
solution volume, 24 mL; 50 mg/L MB; 0.0100 g of various MnxOy@HMSNs; 25 mM
NaHCO3; 60 mM H2O2; and 25 °C.
All MnxOy@HMSNs
were prepared with a pH value of 4.5 and a calcination temperature
of 400 °C.

Figure 8 presents
MB degradations over MnxOy@HMSNs calcined at different temperatures, and their
original UV–visible spectra during dye degradations are shown
in Figure S5. As shown in Figure 8, the highest efficiency for
MB removal is achieved with MnxOy@HMSNs calcined at 400 °C. With the calcination
temperatures increasing, the degradation efficiency over MnxOy@HMSNs decreases.
As shown in Table 2, the higher the calcination temperatures, the smaller the BET specific
surface areas and pore volumes. The decreased degradation efficiency
over materials calcined at higher temperatures is certainly due to
their smaller BET surface areas and pore volumes. The oxidation states
of the inner manganese oxide NPs may also have effects on dye degradation
efficiency. Figure S6 shows the XRD patterns
of MnxOy@HMSNs
calcined at different temperatures. Due to their high dispersions
and low metal loadings, XRD patterns of MnxOy@HMSNs calcined at <900 °C
only show SiO2 diffractions, and distinct diffractions
of MnxOy are
only observed when the calcination temperature reaches 900 °C.
Therefore, control experiments using Mn(CH3COO)2 are investigated. Figure S7 presents
XRD patterns of various MnxOy obtained by the calcination of Mn(CH3COO)2 at different temperatures. Obviously, MnxOy obtained by calcination
at 400 °C consists of Mn3O4 and Mn2O3, while those calcined at >400 °C only
show
Mn2O3 diffractions. Therefore, besides the influences
of BET surface areas and pore volumes at different calcination temperatures,
the different oxidation states of Mn element could also influence
their dye degradation efficiency when the calcination temperatures
of MnxOy@HMSNs
are different.54

Figure 8 MB degradations over
MnxOy@HMSNs
calcined at different temperatures. Reaction
conditions: solution volume, 24 mL; 50 mg/L MB; 0.0100 g of various
MnxOy@HMSNs;
25 mM NaHCO3; 60 mM H2O2; and 25
°C. All MnxOy@HMSNs were synthesized at a pH value of 4.5 and TMOS/Mn ratio of
90/1.

Figure 9 presents
the effects of each component in dye degradation systems on the degradations,
and their original UV–visible spectra are shown in Figure S8. Here, MnxOy@HMSNs with a TMOS/Mn ratio of 90/1,
pH value of 4.5, and calcination temperature of 400 °C are selected
due to their high efficiency (Figure 7). As shown in Figure 9, the MB decolorization over MnxOy@HMSNs without H2O2 and NaHCO3 (square curve) is negligible.
Without MnxOy@HMSNs, MB decolorization with NaHCO3 and H2O2 (pentagonal curve) is <5% and is consistent with
an earlier study,55 where a low concentration
of NaHCO3 could not activate H2O2 without redox metal ions. Moreover, the result of (NaHCO3 + H2O2) suggests that either H2O2 or percarbonate (HCO41–) does not directly degrade MB, where percarbonate is produced through
the equilibrium of H2O2 and bicarbonate.52,56

Figure 9 MB
degradations under different reaction conditions: solution volume,
24 mL; 50 mg/L MB; and 25 °C. If present, MnxOy@HMSNs, 0.0100 g; 60 mM H2O2; and 25 mM NaHCO3. MnxOy@HMSNs were prepared
with a TMOS/Mn ratio of 90/1, pH value of 4.5, and calcination temperature
of 400 °C.

As shown in the triangle
curve of Figure 9,
the MB degradation with H2O2 over MnxOy@HMSNs is roughly
10%, while it is greatly enhanced with
the addition of 25 mM NaHCO3 (pentagram curve). According
to the previous reports,57,58 the bicarbonate will
react with hydroxyl radicals to produce relatively stable carbonate
radicals that are more available than hydroxyl radicals for MB dye
degradations with enhanced efficiency. Further studies on the effect
of NaHCO3 concentrations on the MB degradation are shown
in Figure S9, and their original UV–visible
spectra are illustrated in Figure S10,
where the MB degradation can reach >99% in the initial 10 min with
the presence of 100 mM NaHCO3. Figures S11 and S12 present the effect of catalyst weights on MB degradations
over MnxOy@HMSNs and their original UV–visible spectra, respectively. Figures S13 and S14 show the effect of H2O2 concentrations on MB degradations over MnxOy@HMSNs and their
original UV–visible spectra, respectively. Obviously, the MB
degradation efficiency increases with increasing catalyst weight or
H2O2 concentration.

Figure 10 presents
effects of radical scavengers on MB degradations over MnxOy@HMSNs, and their original
UV–visible spectra are shown in Figure S15. The radicals have been well accepted as the key reactive
species during heterogeneous Fenton-like MB degradations with H2O2,52,59 and ascorbic acid is well known
as a popular radical scavenger.60 As shown
in Figure 10 (the
top curve), the addition of l-ascorbic acid will significantly
inhibit the MB degradation, confirming the presence of radicals during
MB degradation over MnxOy@HMSNs.

Figure 10 Effects of additions of radical scavengers on MB degradations
over
MnxOy@HMSNs
(prepared with a TMOS/Mn ratio of 90/1, pH value of 4.5, and calcination
temperature of 400 °C). Reaction conditions: 50 mg/L MB; 0.0100
g of MnxOy@HMSNs; 25 mM NaHCO3; 60 mM H2O2; and 25 °C.

The effect of the addition
of t-butanol on MB
degradation is shown in Figure 10 (the blue curve). Although t-butanol
is well known as a powerful scavenger for hydroxyl radicals (•OH),61t-butanol does not show any inhibition effect at the concentration
of 60 mM and will promote MB degradation at a higher concentration
(Figures S16 and S17), suggesting that
hydroxyl radical does not directly degrade MB. It is speculated that
the promoting effect of t-butanol at high concentrations
is due to the relatively longer lifetime of t-butanol
radicals, which makes the t-butanol radicals more
available for MB degradation than hydroxyl radicals, resulting in
a promoting effect. In contrast, the addition of p-benzoquinone will significantly decrease the MB degradation rate
(the purple curve), indicating an important role of superoxide radicals
(O2•–).62 However, benzoquinone does not completely inhibit the MB degradation,
suggesting that there are other reactive species responsible for MB
degradation. As shown in Figures S9 and S10, bicarbonate greatly promotes MB degradations with H2O2, indicating the important role of carbonate radical
(CO3•–) on MB degradations.52 It is concluded that carbonate radicals and
superoxide radicals play important roles in MB degradation over MnxOy@HMSNs, where
carbonate radicals are produced by the reaction of hydroxyl radicals
with HCO3– anions, and the superoxide
radicals are generated by further reaction of carbonate radicals with
H2O2.52

Figure 11 presents
degradations of orange II, orange G, rhodamine 6G, methyl orange,
new coccine, and MB over MnxOy@HMSNs. As shown in Figure 11a and their original UV–visible spectra
in Figure S18, in the presence of 25 mM
NaHCO3, decolorizations of MB, orange II, orange G, and
rhodamine 6G reach 94.7% at 60 min, 94.8% at 45 min, 92.4% at 120
min, and 92.5% at 300 min, respectively. In contrast, the decolorizations
of new coccine and methyl orange only approach 76.3% at 300 min and
79.9% at 300 min, respectively. However, as shown in Figure 11b and their original UV–visible
spectra of Figure S19, obvious improvements
of degradations of new coccine and methyl range can be observed in
the double concentration of 50 mM NaHCO3. Decolorization
(76.3%) of new coccine can be achieved within 90 min while an 85.1%
of decolorization of methyl orange is observed at 30 min. Here, MB
and rhodamine 6G represent cationic dyes, while orange G, new coccine,
orange II, and methyl orange are examples of anionic dyes, showing
wide adaptability of MnxOy@HMSNs for degradations of various dyes, and this
unique property is originated from hollow mesoporous nanostructures
with active NPs inside cavities.

described in the Supporting Information, and the comparison of a series of dye degradations over MnxOy@HMSNs and MnxOy/SiO2 is summarized in Table S1. As shown in Table S1, MnxOy@HMSNs illustrate greatly enhanced catalytic
performance for MB, orange G, new coccine, methyl orange, and rhodamine
6G relative to supported MnxOy/SiO2, further confirming the unique property
of active NPs encaged in hollow nanoreactors.

Figure 12 presents
the stability experiments of MB degradations over MnxOy@HMSNs. To avoid mass loss
during the collection of catalysts after each cycle, the recycling
experiments were carried out without catalyst separation. After each
cycle, a fixed small volume of the reaction solution is sampled for
UV–visible measurement, and then the same volume of fresh MB
solution and H2O2 is added to the flask to keep
the total solution volume constant for the next cycle. For calculation
of MB degradation (%), the starting MB in the subsequent cycle includes
the newly added and the remaining MB in the previous cycle. As shown
in Figure 12 and their
original UV–visible spectra (Figure S20), the removal of MB reaches 97.8% in the first cycle and still reaches
over 95% after five cycles, indicating good stability and reusability
of MnxOy@HMSNs.
Moreover, 0.18 ppm of manganese was detected by ICP-OES in the reaction
solution after complete MB degradation, which is less than 1 ppm emission
limit of Chinese regulation standards (GB 31573-2015).

Figure 12 Recycle experiments
of MB degradations over MnxOy@HMSNs synthesized with a
TMOS/Mn ratio of 90/1, pH value of 4.5, and calcination temperature
of 400 °C. Reaction conditions: total solution volume, 24 mL;
reaction time, 2.0 h; and 25 °C. In the first cycle, 50 mg/L
MB; 25 mM NaHCO3; 60 mM H2O2; and
0.0100 g of MnxOy@ HMSNs.

Considering the structural-performance
relationship of MnxOy@HMSNs, the shell
thickness, metal loadings, textural properties, and active phases
of MnxOy are
major influences, where the shell thickness and metal loadings are
adjusted by TMOS/Mn ratios, and the active phases of MnxOy and textural properties
of HMSNs are controlled by the calcination temperatures. In this study,
optimum performance is achieved at a TMOS/Mn ratio of 90/1 and a calcination
temperature of 400 °C. At the mentioned conditions, thin shell,
high specific surface area, and high pore volume are obtained, which
further favors their dye degradation performance.

In such hollow
mesoporous nanoreactors with functional NPs in hollow
cavities, it is believed that mesoporous silica walls provide relatively
fast mass transportation, the large hollow cavities make the inner
NPs remain accessible to reactant molecules, and hollow nanoreactors
facilitate the reactions between reactive radicals and adsorbed reactant
molecules, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity. Moreover, the
mesoporous silica walls protect the inner NPs and prevent the active
components from leaching into solution, enhancing their catalytic
stability.

3 Conclusions
In this
work, MnxOy@HMSNs were synthesized by the deposition of silica onto
manganese ion bound polymer micelles and subsequent calcinations,
and the effects of synthetic parameters on the structures are studied
in detail. Relevant characterizations confirm that these nanoreactors
consist of hollow mesoporous silica nanospheres with small manganese
oxide nanoparticles inside their cavities. The MnxOy@HMSNs can be synthesized
in a wide pH range from 4.0 to 8.0, and hollow nanostructures can
be maintained in the calcination temperature range from 400 to 900
°C. Moreover, the thickness of silica walls and the Mn loadings
can be adjusted through adjusting the starting TMOS/Mn ratios. The
MnxOy@HMSNs
synthesized with a TMOS/Mn ratio of 90/1, pH value of 4.5, and calcination
temperature of 400 °C display greatly enhanced degradations for
a series of cationic and anionic dyes with H2O2, which is ascribed to their unique hollow mesoporous nanostructures
with small MnxOy NPs in hollow cavities. We believe that the synthetic methodology
can be extended to synthesize other materials and such a type of material
will find more applications in wastewater treatment.

Co., Ltd. Synthesis of quaternized poly(2-vinylpyridine)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (positively charged P2MVP128-b-PEO477, Mw/Mn = 1.1, Mw = 34.5k,
level of quaternization is ∼90%) is described in the previous
work.29,30,63 The 1,3,5-tris(2,6-dicarboxypyridin-4-yloxymethyl)benzene
ligands (L3) were synthesized according to the literature.31

4.2 Synthesis of MnxOy@HMSNs
In a typical synthesis,
360 μL of 0.087 mM positively charged P2MVP128-b-PEO477 aqueous solution, 360 μL of 5.0
mM Mn(NO3)2 aqueous solution, and 240 μL
of 5.0 mM L3 aqueous solution were mixed with 9.04 g of
deionized water at room temperature in a 20 mL flask with magnetic
stirring at 200 rpm, where the molar ratio of polymer/L3/Mn is equal to 1/38.3/57.5. The pH value of the above solution was
adjusted to 4.5 (the studied pH range was from 3.0 to 8.5) using diluted
nitric acid and sodium hydroxide aqueous solution. The obtained solution
was further stirred for no less than 2 h to achieve the formation
of uniform micelles. After that, 0.2845 g of 416 mM TMOS methanol
solution (the molar ratio of TMOS/Mn = 90/1, the studied ratio range
was from 90/1 to 300/1) was added into the flask. The resulting mixture
was stirred for 2 days at 200 rpm. During the process, white solid
precipitates can be observed around 24–48 h. The mixture was
left untouched for another 4 days to complete silica polymerization.
The white solids were collected by centrifugation and washing with
water/ethanol several times. Finally, the solids were dried in an
oven at 55 °C and further calcined at 400 °C (the studied
range was from 400 to 1000 °C) in a muffle furnace for 3 h to
obtain MnxOy@HMSNs.

4.3 Characterizations
High-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of various samples
were obtained using a JEOL 2100 transmission electron microscope operated
at 200 kV with an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS). High-angle
annular dark-field scanning transition electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM)
images were obtained using a Talos F200× microscope operated
at 200 kV in the STEM model. The thermal property of the samples was
measured using a PerkinElmer Pyris Diamond thermogravimetric analyzer
(TG/DTA) in the temperature range from 40 to 1200 °C at a heating
rate of 10 °C/min with a gas flow rate of 100 mL/min in an air
atmosphere. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the
samples were recorded at a Nicolet Nexus 670 spectrophotometer. The
metal loadings of samples were determined by an Agilent 725 inductively
coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) specific surface areas, pore size distributions, and the adsorption–desorption
isotherms of various materials were measured by N2 adsorption
at 77 K using an IQ automatic specific surface area and porous physical
adsorption analyzer. UV–visible measurements were carried out
using a UV-1800 spectrophotometer and pure water as the background.

4.4 Dye Degradations over MnxOy@HMSNs
4.4.1 Dye
Degradations over MnxOy@HMSNs
In a typical
experiment, 4.00 mL of 300 mg/L MB aqueous solution, 50.4 mg of NaHCO3, 144.0 μL of 30.0 wt % H2O2,
and 19.86 g of deionized water were mixed in a 30 mL flask with magnetic
stirring at 650 rpm under room temperature. A portion of 0.0100 g
of MnxOy@HMSNs
synthesized at different synthetic parameters was added into the above
solution. During the reaction process, 1.0 mL of reaction mixtures
were sampled at different time intervals and diluted 20 times by deionized
water for UV–visible measurement.

The procedures of degradations
of new coccine, methyl orange, orange II, orange G, and rhodamine
6G are the same as those of methylene blue degradations except that
MnxOy@HMSNs
prepared at the pH value of 4.5, a TMOS/Mn ratio of 90/1, and 400
°C are used. For UV–visible measurements of degradations
of new coccine, methyl orange, orange II, orange G, and rhodamine
6G, the samples at different time intervals are diluted 3 times, 5
times, 3 times, 3 times, and 10 times, respectively.

4.4.2 Recycle Experiments of Methylene Blue Degradations
over MnxOy@HMSNs
In the first run, 4.00 mL of 300 mg/L MB aqueous
solution, 50.4 mg of NaHCO3, 144.0 μL of 30.0 wt
% H2O2 aqueous solution, and 19.86 g of deionized
water were charged into a 30 mL flask with magnetic stirring at 650
rpm under room temperature. A portion of 0.0100 g of MnxOy@HMSNs (synthesized
at the pH value of 4.5, a TMOS/Mn ratio of 90/1, and 400 °C)
was added into the above blue solution. After the reaction time of
2.0 h, 344 μL of the reaction mixture was sampled and diluted
20 times by deionized water for UV–visible measurement. For
the next cycle, 144.0 μL of 30.0 wt % H2O2 aqueous solutions and 200.0 μL of 6000 mg/L MB solution were
added to the above solution. The reaction mixture (344 μL) was
sampled again at 2.0 h for UV–visible measurement. In the second
to fifth cycle, the total reactants include the newly added and the
remaining MB in the previous cycle, which is used to calculate MB
degradation (%).
