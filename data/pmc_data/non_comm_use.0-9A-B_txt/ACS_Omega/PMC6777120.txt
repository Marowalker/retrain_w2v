O-Vanillin and ethylenediamine were
used for the synthesis of N,N′-bis(O-vanillinidene)ethylenediamine
(O-VEDH2) Schiff base ligand, which was characterized by
UV–visible and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The Schiff base
ligand O-VEDH2 has been employed to synthesize novel [C18H22FeN2O6]NO3 (1) and C18H16CuN2O5 (2) complexes by the simple slow evaporation
method. The single crystals were characterized by X-ray crystallography,
as well as Fourier-transform infrared and UV–visible spectroscopy
techniques. Complexes 1 and 2 crystallize
in monoclinic and orthorhombic space groups with P121/n1 (14) and Pnma (62) point
groups, respectively, and both show metal–organic frameworks
like structures. Complexes 1 and 2 have
optical band gaps of 4.1 and 2.9 eV, respectively, indicating their
semiconducting properties. The dye degradation activity and H2O2 sensing of the complexes 1 and 2 were determined in different conditions. The photocatalytic
test was performed in the presence of sunlight, methylene blue (MB),
and complexes 1 and 2. An interesting result
was obtained that complex 2 has degradation ability against
MB and the rate constant (K) is 5.46 × 10–5 s–1, whereas complex 1 has H2O2 sensing properties. Both complexes
are bound to Calf-thymus DNA by intercalation binding mode, and binding
constants (Kb) of complexes 1 and 2 are 3.77 × 103 and 1.49 ×
104 M–1, respectively.

Introduction
The Schiff base metal
complexes are used extensively in the field
of materials science, including catalyst, supramolecular chemistry,
anticancer, antimicrobial, antioxidants, electrochemistry, photocatalysts,
DNA binding, and energy materials.1−14 In
general, the Schiff base can assemble the metal ions to develop metal–organic
framework (MOF) compounds and shows different properties like dye
adsorption, sensing, semiconductor, and biological properties.15−23

In recent years, researchers from around the world have been
working to synthesize metal–organic framework complexes to
promote the degradation or adsorption of dyes and to eliminate the
dyes from chemically contaminated water.24−27 Because most
of the synthetic dyes were used in a wide range of industries, such
as paper, plastics, leather tanneries, food technology, and cosmetics,28,29 waste dyes are discharged into rivers and ponds, thereby contaminating
the water. These dye contaminants can cause allergies, skin irritation,
liver damage, kidney damage, and also central nervous system disorders
in humans and animals.30 Currently, Yang
et al. reported that three-dimensional (3D)-pillared layer copper(II)
MOFs have been used for dual purposes, i.e., dye adsorption and separation.31

Nowadays, MOFs have often been used as
different types of sensing materials, i.e., H2O2 sensing. Reactive oxygen species like H2O2 are nontoxic but produce free radicals such as superoxide anion
(O2•–) and hydroxyl radical (•OH) at the time of decomposition, which plays an important
role for the initiation of cancer, autoimmunity, neurodegenerative
disorders, etc.32−34 Hydrogen
peroxide is widely used in the food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, paper,
and chemical industries.35,36 Therefore, it is necessary
to detect H2O2 for the healthy life of humans
and animals. In the last few years, scientists have developed iron-
and copper metal-based MOFs and reported variable sensing applications,
i.e., fluorescent, luminescent, photocatalytic, and polar aliphatic
volatile organic compounds.37−41

MOFs, as well as various Schiff base ligands, play an important
role
in bioapplications. The effective anticancer drugs have an active
site primarily targeted to bind the DNA of the cancer cell, reducing
the activity of the cancer cell and resulting in cell death.42−44 Anticancer drugs interact with
cancer cell DNA through electrostatic, intercalative, or groove binding,
which depends on the binding modes of anticancer drugs.25,45−47 The
Schiff base ligands and the corresponding metal complexes have the
active site that interacts with the DNA of the cancer cell.48,49 Recently, metal–organic framework systems have been used
in biomedicine, as reported by Chen et al.50,51

In this study, we have designed and synthesized N,N′-bis(O-vanillinidene)ethylenediamine (O-VEDH2) Schiff base ligand and employed it for the synthesis of
new [C18H22FeN2O6]NO3 (1) and C18H16CuN2O5 (2) complexes. The main aim of
our research work is to synthesize transition-metal complexes using
synthesized Schiff base ligand and study their multifunctional applications,
i.e., dye degradation, H2O2 sensing, and DNA
binding activity. The Schiff base ligand is characterized by UV–visible
and 1H NMR spectroscopies. From optical measurements, complexes 1 and 2 have energy band gaps of 4.1 and 2.9
eV, respectively, and show semiconductor property. Complex 1 can actively sense H2O2, whereas complex 2 has no such sensing ability. On the other hand, complex 2 has photocatalytic activity; it degrades methylene blue
(MB) and the rate constant (K) is 5.46 × 10–5 s–1, but complex 1 has no photocatalytic activity. Both the complexes bind to Calf-thymus
DNA (CT-DNA) through intercalation binding mode, and their binding
constants (Kb) were found to be 3.77 ×
103 and 1.49 × 104 M–1, respectively.

Results and Discussion
Structural Description
Complexes 1 and 2 crystallize in monoclinic
and orthorhombic
space groups with P121/n1 and Pnma, respectively, as shown in Figure 1. The phase data of the complexes are shown
in Table 1, and the
selected interatomic distances and angles are listed in Table 2. Both complexes have butterfly-like
structures. Complex 1 was coordinated by two nitrogen
atoms, N(1) and N(2), and two hydroxyl oxygen atoms, O(1) and O(2),
of O-VEDH2 moiety and two oxygen atoms, O(5) and O(6),
of two water molecules and form an octahedral geometry. Two water
molecules are present in the axial position of complex 1. The oxidation state of the metal ion is stabilized by nitrate ion
(NO3–) (surrounding the complex) and
the corresponding protonated oxygen atom in complex 1, whereas complex 2 was coordinated by two nitrogen
atoms, N(1) and N(1)a, and hydroxyl oxygen atoms, O(1) and O(1)a,
from one O-VEDH2 moiety and one oxygen (O3)
atom and developed square pyramidal structure. The oxidation states
of the complexes 1 and 2 are found to be
3+ and 2+, which was also confirmed by the bond valence sum (BVS)
calculation shown in Table 3.52 The bond lengths between the
metal-oxygen and nitrogen of the Schiff base ligand of both complexes
are attached through their normal modes of coordination, i.e., for
complex 1, Fe1–O1, Fe1–O2, Fe1–O5,
Fe1–O6, Fe1–N1, and Fe1–N2 are found to be 1.882(16),
1.866(21), 2.316(13), 2.088(26), 2.094(26), and 2.075(27) Å,
respectively, and for complex 2, Cu1–N1/N1′,
Cu1–O1/O1′, and Cu1–O3 are found to be 1.942(45),
1.932(28), and 2.330(28) Å, respectively. The intra- and intermolecular
H-bonds of complex 1 H5A–O9, H6A–O4, H6A–O9,

H6B–N3, H6B–O9, O8–H6B, N3–H6B, N3–H6A,
and H6A–O8 are found to be 4.669(48), 4.986(29), 4.382(48),

3.686(26), 2.764(26), and 3.927(39) Å, respectively, as shown
in Figure 2a, whereas
complex 2 has no intra- and intermolecular H bonding. Figures 2b and 3a represent van der Waals interaction between complexes 1 and 2, and their corresponding van der Waals
bond lengths are shown in Table 4, which stabilized the complexes. Complex 2 has an asymmetric unit, as shown in Figure 3b, whereas complex 1 has no
asymmetric unit. The most interesting feature was obtained that both
the complexes have built metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) fabricated
through Schiff base ligands linked to the entire two-dimensional net
and a 3D layer framework for 1 and 2, as
shown in Figure 4a,b,
respectively.

Optical Properties
To explain the conductivity of the
isolated complexes, the optical
band gap energy of the complexes was calculated by the Tauc formula
according to eq 1 1  where α denotes the
absorption coefficient, which is calculated as α = (2.303 ×
absorption)/t, t = cubet thickness
(1 cm); A is a constant; Eg indicates the band gap energy; exponent n depends
on the type of transition; and h denotes Planck’s
constant.

Equation 1 was used to plot (αhυ)2 vs hυ (Figure 5) from which band gap energy (Eg) of the complexes was calculated by extrapolating the linear portion
of the curve to (αhυ)2 = 0.
The band gap energy of complexes 1 and 2 were 4.1 and 2.9 eV, respectively. In the solar cell, optoelectronic,
and electronic applications, this result was significant because the
small band gap energy expanded the electronic progress between highest
occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
energy levels and increased the electrical conductivity of the complexes.53−56 The
band gap value suggests that complexes are semiconductor materials
and complex 2 has shown photocatalytic activity due to
the lower band gap energy value (2.9 eV).

Figure 5 Band gap
energies of
(a) complex 1 and (b) complex 2.

Photocatalytic Activity
We continued our experiment
to investigate the photocatalytic activity of the complexes against
different types of organic dyes because the band gap of the complexes
suggests that complexes are semiconductor materials. The photocatalytic
activity of the complexes was investigated against MB, Congo red (CR),
methyl orange (MO), rhodamine B (RB), and naphthalol orange (NO) in
the presence of sunlight (Figure 6a). Among the two complexes, complex 2 has photocatalytic activity against MB (Figure 6b) due to lower band gap energy. The degradation
rate of MB by complex 2 in 210 min was 50%. Photocatalytic
degradation of MB by complex 2 follows the pseudo-first-order
kinetics, and rate constant was determined by the following relation: , where C0 and C denote the MB dye concentration
at times t = 0 and t = t, respectively. The inset in Figure 6b shows a good linear plot of  vs t, in which the rate constant
was 5.46
× 10–5 s–1.

Figure 6 (a) Kinetics of the dye
degradation and (b) MB degradation by complex 2 and rate
of reaction.

Complex 1 has no
photocatalytic activity due to higher band gap energy
value, as a result of which the electron cannot make an effective
transition from valence band to conduction band in the presence of
sunlight. The proposed mechanistic pathway for the degradation of
MB in the presence of complex 2 is shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Possible
mechanism and reason for dye degradation by complex 2 in the presence of sunlight.

H2O2 Sensing by Complexes
To detect
the sensing capacity of the complexes in the presence
of H2O2 by adding 1 mL of 20 mM H2O2 to 3 mL solution of the complexes, the electronic spectrum
was recorded at regular intervals. Figure 8 shows that absorbance of complex 1 decreases with increasing time in the presence of H2O2. After 10 min, we have observed that the characteristic peak
of complex 1 at 274 nm disappears and the color intensity
of complex 1 turns from brown to colorless. It indicates
that complex 1 has H2O2 decomposing
ability, whereas complex 2 has no sensing ability. This
function of complex 1 can be used as the measure to rapidly
detect H2O2 in unknown samples. The addition
of H2O2 to the Fe(III) complex results in the
formation of free radicals, which initiated the degradation of iron
complex, and Fe(III) gets reduced to Fe(II) and decreases the absorbance
of complex 1.

of
H2O2 decomposition by complex 1 is given below. 2   3   4   5   6   7  In the possible proposed reaction
mechanism, eq 5 was an
intermediate of
the decomposition of H2O2 by complex 1.57

DNA
Binding
Before adding CT-DNA to complexes, the stabilities
of complexes 1 and 2 in Tris–HCl
buffer solution were measured by a UV–visible spectrophotometer
at room temperature for 1 h (each 15 min interval measured by UV)
and the absorption peak was not changed. Figure 9 indicates that the UV–vis absorption
spectrum of complexes 1 and 2 have absorption
peak at 274 and 374 nm, respectively, which can be assigned d–d
transition. To demonstrate the binding characteristics of the complexes
with CT-DNA, we used electronic absorption spectroscopy through changes
in absorbance and shift in wavelength. The wavelengths of complexes 1 and 2 exhibit blue shift (for complex 1, the wavelength shifts from 274 to 274, 273, 272, 271, and
271 nm with increasing concentration of CT-DNA of 20, 40, 80, 160,
and 320 μL, respectively, and similarly in complex 2, also wavelength shifts from 374 to 371, 371, 370, 370, and 369
nm with increasing concentration of CT-DNA of 20, 40, 80, 160, and
320 μL, respectively), when the concentration of CT-DNA was
increased.

Figure 9 Absorption spectra of
complexes in the absence and presence of CT-DNA: (a) complex 1 and (b) complex 2.

The intercalability of a metal complex depended on
the conjugation, planarity, ligand donor atoms, and the formation
of the geometry of the complex.25 The absorption
spectra of the complex binding to DNA through intercalation reveal
that blue and red shifts occur due to strong staking interaction between
ligand of complexes and base pairs of DNA. The binding constant Kb of the complexes was determined by eq 8(58) 8  where εa, εf, and εb denote extinction
coefficients of the complex,
CT-DNA, and bound complex, respectively. The binding constants of
complexes 1 and 2 were 3.770 × 103 and 1.488 × 104 M–1, respectively,
as shown in Table 5. Therefore, binding constant values lie within the range of a characteristic
of the CT-DNA binding by complexes through intercalative mode.59,60

Conclusions
The Fe(III)
and Cu(II) complexes of the designed Schiff base ligand N,N′-bis(O-vanillinidene)ethylenediamine (O-VEDH2) were successfully synthesized and characterized by single
X-ray crystallography and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy.
Several applications of the metal complexes were investigated, such
as MOFs, conductivity, photocatalytic activity, H2O2 sensing, and DNA binding activity. Complexes 1 and 2 have MOF structures and semiconductor properties,
and their optical band gap energy values were 4.1 and 2.9 eV, respectively.
Complex 1 has sensing ability to decompose H2O2, but it has no photocatalytic activity, whereas complex 2 has photocatalytic activity against MB degradation but no
sensing ability to decompose H2O2. Both the
complexes were bound to CT-DNA via intercalative mode of interaction,
and binding constants were 3.770 × 103 and 1.488 ×
104 M–1, respectively.

A methanolic solution of O-Vanillin (0.608 g)
was mixed with the methanolic solution of ethylenediamine (0.133 g)

FeCl3 (0.487g, 3 mmol) was
dissolved in 10 mL of acetonitrile, followed by dropwise addition
of O-VEDH2 (0.305 g, 1 mmol) (separately soluble in MeCN

in diethyl ether. Within a week, high-quality black single crystals
resulted under both conditions in high yield, which were washed with
Et2O (two to three times) and dried under vacuum. Yield:
35% (0.17 g). Anal. calcd for complex 1 C18H22FeN3O9: C, 45.01; H, 4.62; N,
8.75%. Found: C, 45.11; H, 4.82; N, 8.56%. Selected IR data in cm–1: 633 (s), 739 (s), 1080 (m), 1218 (m), 1384 (b),
1442 (s), 1550 (s), 1618 (b) [s = strong, m = medium, b = broad] (for
a detailed discussion of IR spectrum of 1, see Figure S2a).

Synthesis of C18H16CuN2O5 (2)
A similar method was followed for the
synthesis of complex 2. Copper sulfate (0.250 g, 1 mmol)
was dissolved in 10 mL of methanol followed by dropwise addition of
acetonitrile solution (0.61 g, 2 mmol) of O-VEDH2 with
the other conditions remaining constant. Within a week, high-quality
green single crystals appeared, which were washed with Et2O (two to three times) and dried under vacuum. Yield: 30% (0.075
g). Anal. calcd for complex 2 C18H16CuN2O5: C, 53.54; H, 3.99; N, 6.94%. Found:
C, 53.23; H, 3.85; N, 6.85%. Selected IR data in cm–1: 499 (b), 601 (s), 772 (s), 1080 (m), 1218 (s), 1394 (m), 1437 (s),
1544 (s), 1636 (b) [s = strong, m = medium, b = broad] (for a detailed
discussion of IR spectrum of 2, see Figure S2b).

Physical Measurements
1H NMR spectroscopy
was performed on a JEOL-400 MHz spectrometer.
Infrared spectra were recorded in the solid-state (KBr pellets) using
a PerkinElmer FT-IR spectrometer in the 400–4000 cm–1 range. Bruker SMART APEX performed elemental analysis (C, H, N)
and X-ray crystallography. UV–visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu
UV-1800) was used to analyze the electronic spectrum of complexes.

Crystallographic Data Collection and
Refinement
Single precious stone X-beam information from
complexes 1 and 2 was collected at 293 and
99 K on the Bruker SMART APEX CCD diffractometer using SMART/SANTI
programming.61 Intensity data were collected
with Mo Kα graphite monochromatized radiation (0.71073 Å)
at 100 K. The structures were understood by a coordinate strategy
using the SHELXS-201362 program, which
was incorporated in WinGX.63,64 Exact corrections to
the absorption were linked to SADABS.65 All nonhydrogen particles were refined with an anisotropic displacement
coefficient. The hydrogen carbon-bonded particles were incorporated
in geometric positions, and the given warm parameters are one to two
times those of the molecule to which they were attached. An initial
search for reciprocal space exposed that complexes 1 and 2 crystallize in monoclinic and orthorhombic space groups
with P121/n1 and Pnma, respectively. A and B alerts are observed in the checkCIF file
of the complexes due to the presence of high disorder in the structure
and solvent molecules.

The results of the precious crystal data
and structure-refined information of complexes 1 and 2 are available in Table 1.

Dye Degradation
Rhodamine B (RB),
Congo Red (CR), methyl orange (MO), naphthalol
orange (NO), and methylene blue (MB) were separately dissolved in
water. The complex (10 mg) was soaked in 10 mL of dye solution and
kept under sunlight. Furthermore, we examined the complex’s
specific photocatalytic activity, and readings with UV spectroscopy
were taken regularly.

Hydrogen Peroxide-Sensing
Capacity of the Complexes
The detection of H2O2 by both complexes is investigated by the protocol developed
by Bera et al. (2013).66 Initially, complexes 1 and 2 were dissolved in CH3CN and
DMF, respectively. A suitable dilute solution of the complexes (3
mL) was noted for the initial of UV–visible spectrum. In the
complex solution, 1 mL of 20 mM H2O2 was added.
The readings were taken at regular intervals with UV–visible
spectroscopy.

DNA Binding Study
Calf-thymus (CT)
DNA was dissolved in Tris–HCl buffer (pH
= 7.25) solution, and its purity was checked from the absorbance ratio
A260/A280, which is in the range 1.8–1.9. Metal complexes 1 and 2 were dissolved, and absorption titration
experiments were performed using increased concentration of CT-DNA
with the constant amount with the metal complex.
