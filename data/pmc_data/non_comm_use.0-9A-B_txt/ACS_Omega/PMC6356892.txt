Osteoporosis is a common metabolic
bone disorder associated with
fragility and bone fracture. Worldwide, osteoporosis results in more
than 8.9 million fractures annually. Additionally, steroid treatments
can cause osteoporosis as a side effect. Salmon calcitonin (sCT) is
injected daily for those on steroid treatments as a means to prevent
and treat osteoporosis side effects. Frequent dosing is inconvenient,
uncomfortable, and often leads to compliance issues. Our objective
was to develop a monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG) and poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) thermosensitive triblock copolymer
(mPEG–PLGA–mPEG)-based controlled release delivery system
at an increased lactide to glycolide ratio (3.5:1, 4.5:1, and 5:1)
to deliver sCT in its active conformation in a controlled fashion
for a prolonged period following a single subcutaneous injection.
Increasing lactide to glycolide ratio increases hydrophobicity of
the PLGA block, which slows degradation of copolymer, thereby prolonging
release and reducing burst release. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography confirmed structural
composition and polydispersity index, respectively. Critical micelle
concentration of the copolymer was 25 μg/mL. The delivery system
was biocompatible as determined using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide cell viability assay. Moreover, the copolymeric system maintained
sCT in a conformationally stable form for the entire duration of storage
and release.

1 Introduction
Osteoporosis, derived
from the Greek terms for “porous bones”,
is one of the most common metabolic bone disorders characterized by
low bone mass.1 In this disease, silent
and progressive loss of bone tissue greatly reduces the density and
quality of bones. Consequently, the bones become more porous and fragile
with an increased susceptibility to painful fractures resulting in
substantial morbidity. The most common fractures associated with osteoporosis
occur at the hip, spine, and wrist.2,3 Risk factors
chiefly include genetics, old age (>50 years), menopause, low body
weight, family history of osteoporosis, history of fracture as an
adult, history of hormone and autoimmune disorders, inactive lifestyle,
lack of calcium and vitamin D, cigarette smoking, and excessive alcohol
consumption.4 Certain medications such
as steroids, anticonvulsants, anticoagulants, antimetabolites, proton-pump
inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, and l-thyroxine have also
been associated with increased risk of osteoporosis by different mechanisms.5−11 Worldwide, one in three women and one in five men are at risk of
an osteoporotic fracture. In US adult population of age 50 years and
older, osteoporosis and low bone mass affect approximately 53.6 million
people (54% of the population).12 In addition
to considerable pain and disability, osteoporotic bone fractures take
a huge personal and economic toll on a person and their family. Elderly
patients can develop pneumonia and pulmonary embolism due to prolonged
bed rest following a painful fracture.13

The goal of treatment for osteoporosis is prevention of bone
fractures
by reducing bone loss or preferably by increasing bone density and
strength. Antiresorptive drugs such as bisphosphonates are most commonly
used in clinical practice. Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclastic bone
removal thus increasing bone density, however, use of these drugs
is associated with severe acute and long-term side effects, which
limit their long-term use and patient compliance.14 Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in post-menopausal women
has been shown to prevent bone loss, increase bone density, and prevent
bone fractures mainly due to the chondro-protective effect of estrogen.
However, because of the increased risks of heart attack, stroke, venous
blood clots, and breast cancer associated with HRT, it is no longer
recommended for long-term therapy of osteoporosis.15 Newer treatments such as anabolic synthetic parathyroid
hormone (PTH), teriparatide and novel antiresorptive antibodies, such
as denosumab, have been used to increase osteoblast activity (promote
new bone growth) and reduce osteoclast activity (inhibit bone resorption),
respectively. However, these drugs are expensive and are generally
reserved for people with severe osteoporosis who have poor tolerance
for other treatments.13

Calcitonin
is an antiresorptive hormone naturally produced by the
parafollicular cells of thyroid gland. It is involved in calcium and
phosphorus metabolism and shows a calcium-lowering effect by counteracting
PTH.16,17 PTH acts to increase the concentration of
calcium in blood, owing to increased bone resorption by altering gene
expression in osteoblasts. In bones, calcitonin almost exclusively
targets calcitonin receptors on osteoclasts interfering with their
differentiation from precursor cells, reducing motility and inducing
retraction by multiple inhibitory mechanisms.16,18 Calcitonin is frequently used in the treatment of several bone-related
disorders such as hypercalcemia, Paget’s disease, and osteoporosis.
In osteoporosis, calcitonin reduces bone resorption and significantly
reduces bone pain, a very common symptom of osteoporosis.19,20 Clinically, synthetic or recombinant salmon calcitonin (sCT) is
widely used because it has 50% sequence homology to human calcitonin,
meanwhile demonstrating 40–50 times higher potency than human
calcitonin because of its higher affinity toward human calcitonin
receptor.21,22

In practice, calcitonin or sCT is
administered by subcutaneous,
intramuscular, or intranasal routes, daily or multiple times per week,
depending on the severity of bone loss.23−25 However, frequent administration
produces discomfort and reduces patient compliance which negatively
affects treatment adherence, thus resulting in treatment gaps.26−28 Calcitonin can be administered through the nasal route, however,
its bioavailability is only ∼25% compared to intramuscular
calcitonin.29 Additionally, intranasal
calcitonin is associated with the risk of nosebleeds, runny nose,
and other nasal irritations.30 Oral formulations
have been tested, but results demonstrate compromised bioactivity,
owing to degradation by enzymes within the digestive tract. Consequently,
controlled release delivery systems for sustained delivery of biologics
prompted development of subcutaneous implants. In situ gel forming
implants consisting of biodegradable polymers became popular for their
ease of administration, lack of surgery for implantation and removal,
and biocompatibility.31−33

Here, we present the formulation development
of a thermosensitive
triblock copolymer-based delivery system releasing sCT in its active
conformation in a controlled fashion for a prolonged period following
a single subcutaneous injection. In the current study, triblock thermosensitive
copolymer monomethoxy poly (ethylene glycol)–poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (mPEG–PLGA–mPEG) has been
investigated for controlled release of sCT for an extended period
of time. Triblock copolymers with increasing ratio of lactide (LA)
to glycolide (GA) (3.5:1, 4.5:1, and 5:1) were synthesized to optimize
hydrophobic and hydrophilic characteristics of the copolymer. Previous
work in our lab has explored LA to GA ratios up to 3:1, and the promising
results observed motivated us to explore the possible benefits of
increasing LA content beyond the 3:1 ratio.34 Phase transition temperature of copolymers was determined using
the tube-inversion method. The copolymer with physiologically relevant
transition was characterized further using proton nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR) to determine structural
composition and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) to determine average
molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI). Critical micelle
concentration (CMC) was determined using pyrene as the fluorescent
hydrophobic probe. Two concentrations of copolymer formulation were
further investigated for in vitro biocompatibility, release, and stability
at physiological and storage conditions.

2 Results
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization of Thermosensitive
Triblock Copolymers
Thermosensitive triblock copolymer mPEG–PLGA–mPEG
with LA to GA ratio 3.5:1, 4.5:1, and 5:1 were synthesized using ring
opening polymerization followed by diblock condensation. The sol to
gel transition temperature of the copolymers was tested using the
tube inversion method. This method allows the determination of temperature
at which the copolymer undergoes complete transition from solution
to gel form. Copolymers that transition at or below body temperature
(37 °C) but remain a solution at room temperature (∼27
°C) are physiologically relevant for in situ depot formation.
In this study, the transition temperatures were observed to be greater
than 40 °C for copolymers with LA/GA, 3.5:1 and 4.5:1. However,
copolymer mPEG–PL5GA1–mPEG (5:1,
LA/GA) transitioned to gel form at 36 °C and was selected for
further characterization. Thereafter, to confirm quick transition
from solution to gel, a fresh sample of copolymer was exposed for
30 s to physiological temperature. As illustrated in Figure 1, the mPEG–PL5GA1–mPEG copolymer (LA/GA, 5:1) at different aqueous
concentrations (30 and 40% w/v) transitioned successfully from sol
to gel in 30 s at 37 °C. Further polymer characterization via 1H NMR and GPC was only investigated for the LA/GA, 5:1 copolymer,
given that it was the only candidate that transitioned within a physiologically
relevant temperature.

1H NMR spectra of the mPEG–PL5GA1–mPEG copolymer confirmed the structure of the
synthesized
mPEG–PLGA–mPEG triblock copolymer. The polymer demonstrated
desired LA to GA ratios corresponding to integrals of peaks. 1H NMR spectra detected peaks at 1.55, 3.38, 3.65, 4.3, 4.8,
and 5.2 ppm corresponding to the CH3 of LA, CH3 of mPEG end group, CH2 of mPEG, CH2 between
PLGA and mPEG, CH2 of GA, and CH of LA, respectively (Figure 2).

Molecular weight distribution
of the mPEG–PL5GA1–mPEG (LA/GA,
5:1) copolymer was determined
using GPC size determination and to provide evidence of the homogeneity
of the copolymer (PDI). Number average molecular weight (Mn) and weight average molecular weight (Mw) of the copolymer were found to be 2950 and 4180 Da,
respectively, while PDI was found to be ∼1.42 (Figure 3).

copolymer.

CMC of the mPEG–PL5GA1–mPEG
(LA/GA, 5:1) copolymer was determined using the pyrene fluorescence
probe method and was found to be 25 μg/mL (Figure 4). Transition from solution
to gel is based on the hydrophobic effect and ability of the polymer
to arrange itself into an ordered micellar structure. Low CMC value
supports the amphiphilic structure of the copolymer that organizes
into fairly stable micelles at relatively low concentration.

2.2 In Vitro Biocompatibility
Assay
In
vitro biocompatibility of the mPEG–PL5GA1–mPEG (LA/GA, 5:1) copolymer was evaluated by testing different
concentrations of the copolymer in HEK 293 cells by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) cell viability assay. Biocompatibility in HEK 293 is
widely considered necessary to support cyto-compatibility in vivo
and assess adverse reactions of the sample. Compared to control, the
viability of cells incubated with copolymer samples was found to be
higher than 80% when tested up to a concentration of 1 mg/mL (Figure 5). However, increasing
the copolymer concentration beyond 1 mg/mL reduced cell viability.
The IC50 of the copolymer was found to be >10 mg/mL,
which
suggests high cyto-compatibility of the copolymer.

SD (n = 4).

2.3 In Vitro
Release Profile of Salmon Calcitonin
Formulations composed
of sCT incorporated in the mPEG–PL5GA1–mPEG (LA/GA, 5:1) thermosensitive triblock
copolymer (30 and 40% w/v) were easily injectable using a 25 G syringe
and transitioned instantaneously into a gel upon incubation at 37
°C. Percent cumulative release of sCT from thermosensitive copolymer
formulations were studied in vitro. In order to be most effective,
the release of therapeutics from a controlled release delivery system
should follow zero-order kinetics so that a constant level of the
drug is maintained continuously in circulation and hence produce sustained
action. In vitro release profile mimics what can be expected to be
seen in vivo, which allows for optimization needed prior to in vivo
studies. Factors such as burst release, release rate, and complete
release are important in optimization of a sustained release formulation
based on the drug’s therapeutic index, toxicity profile, and
mode of action. Looking at two concentrations of copolymer formulations
allows us to optimize the formulation to achieve the best release
profile. Higher concentrations of copolymer within the formulation
will result in slower release over time because of a few factors such
as slower degradation rate and increased viscosity through which therapeutics
would need to overcome for the release from diffusion to occur. An
initial burst release of sCT at 10.6 ± 0.58 and 7.7 ± 3.8%
from the 30 and 40% formulations, respectively, was observed. Burst
release was followed by a steady release for up to 49 and 70 days,
respectively, for the two formulations and amounted to a cumulative
sCT release of 103.2 ± 4.64 and 106.4 ± 6.16% for the 30
and 40% formulations (Figure 6). A low burst, such as that shown in this system, is desirable
to avoid toxicity because of high drug concentrations in the body.
The study also demonstrates the stability of the depot and provides
insights into its ability to control the release of incorporated therapeutic.
The release profile correlation coefficients (r2 values) best fit zero-order release with values of 0.991
and 0.942, respectively for 30 and 40% formulations. Biphasic nature
of release from such copolymer-based delivery systems is attributed
to the initial rapid release of therapeutic incorporated near the
surface which can diffuse out, giving the initial burst release. This
is followed by a slow controlled release, owing to controlled breakdown
of the polymer and diffusion of therapeutic through the copolymer
matrix, which appears as the second phase of release. In this study,
optimization of LA to GA ratio has minimized biphasic characteristic
of the sCT release profile, and this release best fits zero-order
release, which is desirable for depot-based delivery systems. This
also reiterates the importance of formulation optimization such as
changes in the copolymer composition, which would further help in
optimizing the overall release profile of therapeutics through such
copolymeric depot-based delivery systems.

2.4.1 Stability
of Salmon Calcitonin Released
at Physiological Temperature
Released sCT must be in its
native conformation in order to interact with its receptor and demonstrate
bioactivity. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of sCT released from
copolymer depot at 37 °C withdrawn at 15 and 30 days, showed
characteristic minima at ∼205 nm, corresponding to the freshly
prepared sCT (Figure 7A). Secondary structure analysis of freshly prepared sCT and sCT
released from copolymeric formulation is reported in Table 1A. This analysis of sCT released
from the copolymer supports its protection from denaturation inside
the polymer depot and retention of its bioactive conformation upon
release. Previous work at our labaratory using CD, matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy,
and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), to evaluate the
stability and bioactivity of sCT, has shown that PEG/poly lactic acid/PLGA-based
copolymer systems are able to protect incorporated protein/peptide
from denaturation and release them in a biologically active form.35

formulations. The spectra show native sCT (freshly prepared solution)
and sCT released from the polymeric formulations at 37 °C, withdrawn

and 30 days, stored at 4 °C (n = 4).

2.4.2 Stability
of Salmon Calcitonin inside the
Gel during Storage at 4 °C
Preparation and storage of
therapeutics play a large role in the assessment of its suitability
for future development and use in the clinics. Stability of sCT incorporated
in the gel depot was assessed to make sure that the structure of the
protein remains unaltered during storage at 4 °C. CD spectra
of sCT extracted from the copolymer depot stored at 4 °C, at
15 and 30 days, showed minima at 208 and 222 nm, which is typical
of an α-helix structure and characteristic of native conformational
structure of sCT in the presence of an organic solvent, as compared
to the standard solution comprising freshly prepared sCT in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS)/acetonitrile (ACN), 1:1 v/v (Figure 7B). Secondary structure analysis
of standard and sCT extracted from stored copolymer depots is reported
in Table 1B. These
results support the expectation that this formulation can be prepared
and stored for at least one month before use. For most purposes, the
protein will be incorporated into the polymer and stored under refrigeration
until used. Manufacture of formulation that is ready for injection
would add to the ease of use in comparison to current conventional
methods.

3 Discussion
Controlled
release of proteins and peptides in a structurally stable
form has been the focus of several investigations over the past decades.
Treatment of osteoporosis using controlled release of antiresorptive
peptide sCT has been proposed in this study using thermosensitive,
triblock copolymer-based delivery system. Thermosensitive triblock
copolymer mPEG–PLGA–mPEG was synthesized using ring
opening polymerization followed by diblock condensation. The novelty
of this study lies in how the LA to GA ratios were varied in the PLGA
block (3.5:1, 4.5:1, and 5:1) to optimize hydrophobic and hydrophilic
characteristics of the copolymer expanding on our previous work with
ratios up to 3:1 LA to GA.35 mPEG is hydrophilic
and the molecular weight can be varied to increase or decrease the
hydrophilic nature of the copolymer.36 The
PLGA block is hydrophobic with LA being more hydrophobic than GA.37 Therefore, increasing the block size and/or
LA to GA ratio can influence the amphiphilic properties of the copolymer.
Furthermore, breakdown of the polymer is attributed to hydrolysis
of the PLGA bonds and mPEG to form lactic acid, glycolic acid, and
smaller fragments of mPEG.38−40 Breakdown of the copolymer can
be slowed by increasing the ratio of LA to GA composition of the PLGA
block.41,42 It has been reported earlier that release
from such delivery systems is dependent on diffusion of the incorporated
therapeutic and slow controlled breakdown of the copolymer.38 Consequently, by increasing the ratio of LA
within the PLGA block, the hydrophobicity of the copolymer is increased,
allowing decreased rate of copolymer breakdown which extends the release
of the incorporated therapeutic. In addition, the weight to volume
ratio at which the copolymer is mixed with water can also have an
impact on polymer degradation and diffusion of therapeutics, and therefore
the release of incorporated therapeutics. Because hydrolysis of the
copolymer backbone is the key to polymer breakdown, having a higher
copolymer content can avoid unnecessary or unwanted hydrolysis. However,
with increasing copolymer content, the copolymeric solution becomes
viscous, and consequently, the impact on solution injectability needs
to be taken into consideration. With the help of electron microscopy,
visual representation of the breakdown and surface deformities that
occur as breakdown progresses can be obtained. Our previous work provides
scanning electron microscopy images of the porous morphology, resulting
from the breakdown of polymer and diffusion of molecules over the
course of release.43

The previous
work performed in our labaratory by Singh et al. has
explored variations of thermosensitive triblock copolymers including
PLGA–PEG–PLGA and mPEG–PLGA–mPEG with
LA to GA ratios up to 3:1 for controlled release of model peptide-based
therapeutics such as lysozyme and sCT.35,37,44,47 These previous studies
were the basis for exploring LA to GA ratios of 3.5:1, 4.5:1, and
5:1. Initial studies of mPEG–PLGA–mPEG consisted of
eleven variations of mPEG–PLGA–mPEG synthesized with
serially increasing length of mPEG and PLGA blocks with LA to GA ratios
up to 3:1, in order to find a copolymer with the longest hydrophobic
PLGA block, while maintaining the desired properties of minimal burst
release, controlled release, and complete release of conformationally
stable therapeutic.34 Eleven copolymers
were synthesized out of which, only four were able to transition from
solution to gel form at body temperature, as tested using the test
tube inversion method. These were further tested for controlled release
and biocompatibility. The release of lysozyme showed the importance
of the block length in a number of ways.37 First, it showed how copolymers with smaller mPEG length were able
to form more stable gels with lower burst release as well as volume
contraction upon expulsion of the aqueous phase and push out effect.
Second, the larger PLGA block gave insight into its role in slowing
degradation of the copolymer, which in turn, slows release of therapeutic.
Larger PLGA block makes the gel more hydrophobic making breakdown,
which is primarily due to hydrolysis, more difficult. From this initial
study, further testing using sCT was explored in this research using
the insight gained.45 Both lysozyme and
sCT retained bioactivity as evidenced by CD, MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy,
and HPLC analysis of entrapped and released therapeutic, demonstrating
the ability of the copolymer to protect the structure of sensitive
protein and peptide-based therapeutics. Release of therapeutics was
observed over the course of 28 and 42 days for lysozyme and sCT, respectively.
Burst release was minimized to ∼22% for lysozyme and ∼6%
for sCT. The complete details and further insight into the rationale
of the current work can be found in previous publication.35−37,44,47

Furthermore, the aforementioned 3:1 thermosensitive copolymer
was
evaluated in vivo for sCT levels and serum calcium levels. The results
demonstrated increased sCT level for over 40 days and decreased serum
calcium levels for over a month. The therapeutic effect was further
tested by investigating the ability to prevent methylprednisolone
acetate-induced osteopenia, and the results indicated retention of
normal serum osteocalcin levels for up to 6 weeks using the depot
formulation. On the basis of these data, a similar retention of bioactivity
and therapeutic effect in vivo is expected using the formulation explored
in the current study.

Others have found promising results in
this area as well. In a
recent study by Ding et al., a thermosensitive triblock copolymer
of PLGA–PEG–PLGA was use as a controlled-release delivery
system for a complex of sCT and oxidized calcium alginate. They found
that in vivo in rats over 30 days that the treatment was effective
in decreasing serum calcium and bone reconstruction while under glucocorticoid-induced
osteopenia.45 In addition, Li et al. were
able to investigate a supramolecular nanoparticle of a dipeptide (Asp–Phe,
DF) that was complexed with sCT in vitro and in vivo. Release of over
one month showed promise as a system that can bypass polymeric materials.46 This work supports the progress we are making
in further development of controlled-release systems for osteopenia/osteoporosis.

The balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic blocks in the copolymer
is the driving force behind its transition from solution to gel.35,37,44 This delicate balance can be
manipulated based on the structural composition of the copolymer.
The hydrophobic effect in the presence of increased temperature drives
the rearrangement of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic blocks in order
to decrease entropy and be energetically favorable. The effects of
altering the hydrophobicity of the polymer as a whole are evidenced
by the sol–gel transition temperatures observed for each copolymer.
In this study, sol to gel transition temperatures of mPEG–PLGA–mPEG
copolymers of three different LA to GA ratios were tested using the
tube inversion method and copolymer with LA/GA 5:1, where phase transition
temperature <37 °C was found to be appropriate for further
development into a controlled-release formulation. 1H NMR
spectra confirmed successful synthesis of the mPEG–PLGA–mPEG
copolymer with LA to GA ratio 5:1. Furthermore, GPC verified fairly
uniform distribution of the purified copolymers evident by narrow
and symmetrical distribution of retention peak and PDI relatively
close to a value of 1. In general, a PDI value of less than 2 is considered
an optimal polymerization method.38,42−44

Copolymer mPEG–PLGA–mPEG forms micelles in aqueous
solution, owing to their amphiphilic nature. The ability of copolymer
mPEG–PLGA–mPEG to form micelles is yet another way in
which the hydrophobic effect is evident. Amphipathic copolymer chains
will rearrange in order to minimize interactions of hydrophobic blocks
with the aqueous solvent. The hydrophobic domain induces assembly
of the hydrophobic PLGA chains toward the core of the micellar structure
and hydrophilic PEG chains facing the aqueous solvent. CMC is a unique
characteristic concentration at which induction of micellar assembly
takes place.15 CMC of the mPEG–PL5GA1–mPEG (LA/GA, 5:1) thermosensitive triblock
copolymer was determined using a fluorimeter with pyrene as the hydrophobic
fluorescence probe. Fluorescence of pyrene at increasing copolymer
concentration was measured and intensity ratios of peaks at 379 and
393 nm were calculated. Once CMC was reached, a drastic decline in
graph was seen because of decreased fluorescence detection of pyrene,
owing to its entrapment within the micelles. Pyrene is attracted to
the hydrophobic environment within the micelles and at CMC micellar
assembly allows entrapment of hydrophobic pyrene, which can be seen
as a sharp decline in intensity ratios of its first peak to the third.15 The point of sharp decline in fluorescence intensity
in Figure 4 shows that
the CMC of mPEG–PL5GA1–mPEG (LA/GA,
5:1) thermosensitive triblock copolymer is 25 μg/mL.

Initial
research into thermosensitive delivery systems was limited
because of toxicity caused by the use of organic solvents, such as
with organogels,45 and cytotoxicity of
the polymers, such as poly(N-isopropyl acryl amide)
and poloxamers (polyethylene oxide, polypropylene oxide) because of
their inability to biodegrade.38,46 The development of
mPEG–PLGA–mPEG triblock copolymers greatly improved
thermosensitive polymer applicability, given their excellent biocompatibility
and biodegradation.37,46,47 Triblock copolymer mPEG–PL5GA1–mPEG
(LA/GA, 5:1) used in this study showed relative cell viability >80%
for up to 1 mg/mL concentration with an IC50 > 10 mg/mL
in HEK 293 cells. The products of polymer breakdown are lactic acid,
glycolic acid, and smaller fragments of mPEG, which are naturally
metabolized and excreted by the body and are therefore highly biocompatible.
Furthermore, aqueous solubility of mPEG–PLGA–mPEG avoids
the use of toxic organic solvents in the delivery system.48−51

It is not uncommon for controlled-release systems to exhibit
burst
release at or above 20% within the first 24 h.36 This has primarily been attributed to the amount of drug
that lies near the surface of the gel implant and is readily released.36−38 However, when the concentration of the polymer and/or the hydrophobic
block is altered to increase the overall hydrophobic nature of the
polymer, diffusion can be reduced, and the burst release can be minimized.
Eventually, breakdown of the polymer allows therapeutic molecules
to be released, which consequently creates channels to be formed in
the gel matrix, allowing for subsequent breakdown and diffusion to
occur.38,41,43 The breakdown
of the polymer can be tracked by measuring weight change over the
course of release/exposure to the aqueous environment as shown in
our previous research, looking at the effects of molar mass and water
solubility of incorporated molecules on the degradation profile of
the triblock copolymer delivery system.43 In such instances, the release profile may show a biphasic release
or a drastically increased release rate toward the end of release.
Release profiles of sCT demonstrated by copolymer mPEG–PL5GA1–mPEG (LA/GA, 5:1), used in this study
at 30 and 40% (w/v), maintains steady release over the entire duration,
justifying superior control of the copolymer over release of therapeutic
on increasing the hydrophobic to hydrophilic block ratio when compared
to other systems such as our previous work using only ∼3:1
LA to GA ratio copolymer.44 In addition,
the increased w/v of the copolymer in our formulation from 30 to 40%
also helps decrease burst release and provide for a longer duration
of release. The constant supply of therapeutic will help maintain
constant therapeutic level of sCT, thereby avoiding peaks and troughs
concomitant to multiple administrations.

In recent years, several
proteins and peptides have surfaced as
an essential category of therapeutic drugs. However, their unique
physiochemical and biological properties make them susceptible to
chemical and physical degradation. Stability of protein therapeutics
is one of the major challenges associated with controlled delivery
of such drugs over a prolonged duration. Several enzymes and environmental
factors pose challenges in vivo, necessitating frequent dosing of
protein and peptide-based drugs. Thermosensitive copolymer depot-based
controlled-drug delivery systems overcome stability challenges of
protein-based therapeutics alongside providing a controlled release.
These copolymers protect the native conformation of the sCT protein
structure by masking it from the effect of surrounding environment
in the depot form. Hence, the protein is maintained and released in
its active conformation from such copolymeric depot-based delivery
systems. CD spectroscopy confirmed the conformational stability of
sCT released from the delivery systems in comparison to freshly prepared
sCT solution. Storage stability of sCT incorporated in the thermosensitive
copolymer stored at 4 °C also revealed that sCT maintains its
conformational stability in comparison to freshly prepared sCT solution,
owing to the protective effect of the copolymer incorporating sCT.
The results indicate sCT is released from the mPEG–PL5GA1–mPEG (LA/GA, 5:1) copolymeric depot in its
native conformation, which is essential for its biological activity.
Our previous work with this polymer at a 3:1 LA to GA ratio further
demonstrates the ability of the polymer to protect sCT as evidenced
by CD, MALDI-TOF, and HPLC results.35 In
addition, we know that sCT is relatively stable, but loss of native
confirmation can reduce or completely eliminate its bioactivity. However,
it has been shown that sCT undergoes denaturation only after prolonged
exposure (>35 h) in aqueous solution at temperatures ≥40
°C,
which is not expected under physiological conditions. Furthermore,
PEG has been shown to prevent aggregation of sCT.52

4 Conclusions
Patient compliance for
effective and long-term management of chronic
diseases such as osteoporosis is a major medical hurdle, and patients
benefit most when therapeutic levels of drugs are maintained at an
optimal concentration in the body without frequent administration.
Controlled-release delivery systems, particularly subcutaneous depot
systems help overcome this hurdle by making the dosing regimen easy,
convenient, and consistent. To this end, we have developed and characterized
a PEG–PLGA-based thermosensitive triblock copolymer for controlled
delivery of sCT. The copolymer exhibited exceptional biocompatibility
and demonstrated zero-order release profile of sCT over a period of
∼60–70 days in a biologically active form. This thermosensitive
copolymer-based delivery system could potentially deliver sCT at a
controlled rate for up to two months following a single subcutaneous
injection, thus improving patient compliance and quality of life in
the treatment of osteoporosis. Further studies would entail determination
of drug release in vivo, efficacy of the formulation in the treatment
of osteoporosis in an appropriate animal model as well as long-term
biocompatibility. Overall, ease of synthesis and incorporation of
therapeutics in the thermosensitive copolymer-based controlled-delivery
system used in this study can potentially change the conventional
strategy for delivering various proteins and peptide-based therapeutic
molecules.

5 Materials and Methods
5.1 Materials
GA, MTT and isophorone
diisocyanate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). d,l-LA and methoxypolyethylene glycol-500 were acquired
from TCI America (Portland, OR, USA) and Polysciences Inc. (Warrington,
PA, USA), respectively. Stannous octoate was purchased from Pfaltz
and Bauer Inc. (Waterbury, CT, USA). sCT was procured from Calbiochem
(Burlington, MA, USA). Micro-bicinchoninic (micro-BCA) protein assay
kit was obtained from Pierce Biotechnology Inc. (Rockford, IL, USA).
Human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cell lines, Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM), and PBS were purchased from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA). All other chemicals
were of analytical grade and used without further modification.

5.2 Synthesis and Characterization of Thermosensitive
Triblock Copolymers
Thermosensitive triblock copolymer mPEG–PLGA–mPEG
was synthesized using ring opening polymerization following diblock
condensation (Scheme 1).34 LA to GA ratios were varied in the
PLGA block (3.5:1, 4.5:1, and 5:1) to optimize hydrophobic and hydrophilic
characteristics of the copolymer. Briefly, mPEG (11 g) was dissolved
in anhydrous toluene in a three-necked round-bottom flask heated to
120 °C under continuous stirring. GA (2.32 g), LA (10.08, 12.96,
or 14.4 g for 3.5:1, 4.5:1, or 5:1, respectively), and catalyst stannous
octoate (0.03% w/w) were then added and refluxed under nitrogen atmosphere
for 18 h to produce mPEG–PLGA diblocks. The temperature was
then cooled to 60 °C and isophorone diisocyanate was added in
excess (∼7 mL) followed by coupling for 12 h. The contents
were then refluxed at 120 °C for 6 h followed by cooling to room
temperature. The copolymer was then purified by addition of ice cold
anhydrous diethyl ether followed by removal of the organic solvent
twice. The purified copolymer was vacuum dried to completely evaporate
residual organic solvents.

5.2.1 Sol
to Gel Transition Temperature
Sol to gel transition temperature
of the polymer with increasing
LA/GA was determined using the tube-inversion method. Copolymer samples
were dissolved in deionized water at 30 and 40% (w/v) concentration
and injected into glass tubes immersed in a water bath. Using 2 °C
increments, the temperature of the water bath was raised from room
temperature (∼27 °C) to 43 °C while allowing the
samples to acclimatize for 10 min at each temperature point. After
10 min, the glass tubes were inverted and the characteristics (sol/gel)
of the copolymer were analyzed. The copolymer with physiologically
relevant phase transition temperature was further analyzed.

5.2.2 1H NMR Spectroscopy
The copolymer sample
was dissolved in CDCl3 and analyzed
using 1H NMR (Mercury Varian 400 MHz) spectroscopy to determine
its structural composition. Tetramethylsilane was taken as the zero-chemical
shift. Representative peaks for LA (−CH3) and GA
(−CH2) components were integrated to determine LA
to GA ratio of the copolymer. Bruker TopSpin 3.2.b.69 software provided
with the NMR instrument was used for phase correction and evaluation
of peaks.

5.2.3 Gel Permeation Chromatography
Copolymer
sample (5 mg/mL) was prepared in tetrahydrofuran and analyzed using
GPC (Tosoh Bioscience EcoSEC HLC-8320: modular system with refractive
index and UV detectors) to find retention time and determine weight
average molecular weight, number average molecular weight, and PDI
of the synthesized copolymer.

5.2.4 Critical
Micelle Concentration
CMC of the copolymer was determined
using pyrene as the hydrophobic
probe.15 Pyrene was dissolved in acetone
(24 μg/mL) and 10 μL aliquots were added to each glass
test tube. Acetone was evaporated, and 2 mL aqueous polymer solution
was added to each tube at increasing polymer concentrations ranging
from 0.5 to 1000 μg/mL. The test tubes were vortexed briefly
multiple times followed by a resting period in the dark for 12 h.
Fluorescence of pyrene at each concentration was measured using a
Fluoromax-4 spectrofluorometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, NJ, USA) with excitation
set at 336 nm and emission from 360 to 450 nm (excitation and emission
slit widths of 1 nm). Intensity ratios of peaks 379 and 393 nm were
calculated and plotted against logarithm of concentration to determine
CMC.

5.3 In Vitro Biocompatibility
Assay
In
vitro biocompatibility of the polymer was estimated using MTT cell
viability assay using human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK-293) and
DMEM. Cells were seeded in a 96 well plate at a density of 5 ×
103 cells per well followed by incubation at 37 °C
and 5% CO2. After 24 h of incubation, the media was replaced
with fresh serum-free media containing increasing concentrations of
the copolymer (0.1, 1, 2, 5, or 10 mg/mL). Cells were further incubated
with the copolymer sample for 24 h. Cells incubated without any copolymer
were taken as control. Following incubation, media was removed and
20 μL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) was added to each well and incubated
for 2 h to allow formation of formazan crystals. MTT solution was
carefully aspirated and dimethyl sulfoxide (150 μL) was added
to each well to dissolve formazan crystals. Absorbance was recorded
at 570 nm, and relative cell viability was calculated using the following
equation  where, Apolymer is average
absorbance of wells incubated with polymer samples and ADMEM only is the average absorbance of
the control wells incubated with serum-free DMEM.

5.4 In Vitro Release Profile of Salmon Calcitonin
Formulations
were prepared by suspending sCT (2.5 mg) in 30 and
40% w/v aqueous copolymer solutions. Using a 25 G syringe, 0.5 mL
of the formulation being tested was injected in each glass tube and
incubated in a water bath at 37 °C to form a gel depot. Prewarmed
PBS (10 mM, pH 7.4) containing 0.02% w/v sodium azide was then added
to each tube as the release medium (4 mL per tube). The tubes were
capped to prevent evaporation and incubated at 37 °C under constant
shaking at 35 rpm. Sample aliquots (1 mL) were taken at selected time
points and replaced with 1 mL fresh prewarmed release medium. Released
protein sCT was quantified using micro BCA protein assay kit, following
manufacturer’s instructions. Cumulative percent released was
calculated over the course of delivery.

5.5 Stability
of Salmon Calcitonin
Conformational
changes in sCT released from the thermosensitive copolymer formulation
were evaluated both at physiological and storage temperatures of 37
and 4 °C, respectively, using CD spectroscopy.

5.5.1 Stability of Released Salmon Calcitonin
at Physiological Temperature
Conformational stability of
sCT released in vitro from thermosensitive copolymer formulation mPEG–PL3.5GA1–mPEG (LA/GA, 3.5:1) 40% (w/v) at 37
°C was analyzed at specific time intervals using circular CD
spectroscopy. Samples were centrifuged, filtered, and degassed prior
to analysis. PBS (10 mM, pH 7.4) was used as reference buffer. CD
spectra were scanned in the far-UV region (190–230 nm) to investigate
the changes in the secondary structure of sCT. All spectra were recorded
at a scan rate of 50 nm/min at 20 °C using a quartz cuvette (0.1
cm path length). Freshly prepared sCT solution in PBS (10 mM, pH 7.4)
was used as the standard. Spectra Manager2 software (Jasco, Tokyo,
Japan) was used for spectrum analysis.

5.5.2 Stability
of Salmon Calcitonin inside Gel
during Storage at 4 °C
Conformational stability of sCT
incorporated in thermosensitive copolymer formulation mPEG–PL3.5GA1–mPEG (LA/GA, 3.5:1) 40% (w/v) at storage
temperature (4 °C) was also determined using CD spectroscopy
as aforementioned. sCT was extracted from the copolymer formulations
using ACN/PBS (1:1, v/v) at predetermined time points.44 The stability of sCT, as evidenced by the presence
of two peaks in ACN/PBS, was compared with that of freshly prepared
sCT [1 mg/mL, ACN/PBS (1:1, v/v)].

5.6 Data
Analysis
All data are expressed
as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analyses were
performed using two-tailed Student’s t-test
and ANOVA. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered
to be significant.
