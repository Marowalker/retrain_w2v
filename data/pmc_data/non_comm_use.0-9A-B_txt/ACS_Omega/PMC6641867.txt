A B3LYP density functional theory
study on the oxidative addition
of halogenobenzenes and toluene to monoligated zerovalent palladium
catalysts (Pd–L) has been carried out using the “L”
ligands such as phosphines, N-heterocyclic carbenes, alkynes, and
alkenes. The electron deficiency of the undercoordinated Pd in Pd–L
is quantified in terms of the molecular electrostatic potential at
the metal center (VPd), which showed significant
variation with respect to the nature of the L ligand. Further, a strong
linear correlation between ΔVPd and
the activation barrier (Eact) of the reaction
is established. The correlation plots between ΔVPd and Eact suggest that a
priori prediction on the ability of the palladium complex to undergo
oxidative addition is possible from VPd analysis. In general, as the electron-donating nature of ligand
increases, the suitability of Pd(0) catalyst to undergo oxidative
addition increases. VPd measures the electron-rich/-deficient
nature of the metal center and provides a quantitative measure of
the reactivity of the catalyst. By tuning the VPd value, efficient catalysts can be designed.

Introduction
Palladium catalysts
have emerged as an invaluable tool for organometallic
synthesis, mainly in cross-coupling reactions such as Heck,1 Negishi,2 Suzuki–Miyaura,3 Stille,4 Sonogashira,5 and so forth, to form carbon–carbon and
carbon-hetero atom bonds.6−11 In general, the initial step of the catalytic cycle comprises an
oxidative addition of electrophilic aryl halide to zerovalent palladium
center (Pd(0)), generating a Pd(II) aryl halo complex, which is often
observed as the rate-limiting step.12,13 Hence, activation
energy (Eact) for the oxidative addition
becomes a key thermodynamic parameter to be tuned for the successful
design of efficient catalysts, and several experimental14,15 and computational16−22 studies have been devoted to such attempts. Many of the developed
Pd(0) catalysts are found to be most effective with two electron-donating
phosphines15,23,24 and N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs),25−29 while a few studies have been reported for Pd(0)
complexes of alkenes30 and alkynes.31,32 In the catalyst design strategy, the choice of ligands in Pd(0)
systems can have a considerable impact on the reaction pathway, as
the fine-tuning of Eact is often achieved
by a balanced mix of steric and electronic effect exerted by the ligand
on the metal center, which effectively determines the kinetic aspects
of the reaction.33

Oxidative addition
of aryl halides (Ar–X) to Pd(0) complexes
has gained considerable interest in both experimental34,35 and theoretical20,36−38 studies owing
to their wide range of applications in modern organic synthesis. Aryl
bromides, iodides, and triflates are the general substrates used in
this category, whereas chlorides are found to be generally unreactive,7 and thus efforts have been made to make them
more reactive.7,12,34,39 Mechanistic studies in this area are pioneered
by the works of Hartwig,14,35,39 Amatore,40 and Norrby.16,17,32,41 Various studies
identified either the presence of coordinatively unsaturated 14-electron
complex with two donor ligands (PdL2) or the one-ligand-dissociated
12-electron complex (PdL) as the major species in solution based on
their ligand size.42 As per the typical
mechanisms summarized in Scheme 1, the active form of the catalyst PdL2 either
interacts with Ar–X directly and follows an associative pathway
to give the oxidation product or dissociates to PdL and reacts with
Ar–X to form a σ adduct. In the σ adduct, the C–X
bond is activated and eventually breaks to form the oxidative addition
product. Kozuch et al. have shown that the tricoordinated anionic
Pd intermediate (Pd0L2Cl–)
formed by introducing anions such as chlorides is more susceptible
to an oxidative addition of aryl halides than the regular Pd0L2 catalyst.43,44 Senn and Ziegler have
investigated the oxidative addition of phenyl halides to bidentate
phosphines.22 A density functional theory
study conducted by Ahlquist and Norrby on oxidative addition of aryl
chlorides to monoligated Pd(0) has gained much attention recently.16 Hartwig et al. studied the mechanism for the
oxidative addition of haloarenes to trialkylphosphine Pd(0) complexes
and evaluated the steric properties of ligands.14 Numerous studies show that the use of hindered phosphines
as ligands for palladium complexes has significantly improved the
catalytic activity.45 In the case of Pd–phosphine
complexes, Hartwig and Paul,46 Mitchell
and Baird,47 Harvey et al.,20 and Brown and Jutand15 have demonstrated that even small changes to PR3 ligands
can influence the mechanism of the reaction substantially, showing
equilibria among PdL4, PdL3, and PdL2, as well as a preference for associative displacement pathways for
the oxidative addition step. The present study focuses only on the
reactivity of the monoligated PdL complexes (L = phosphines, NHCs,
alkynes, and alkenes) in the dissociative pathway and uses molecular
electrostatic potential (MESP) analysis as a tool to understand the
subtle variations in the energetics of the oxidative addition of Ph–X
(X = F, Cl, Br, and CH3) to Pd(0).

Scheme 1 Associative and Dissociative
Pathways of Oxidative Addition
MESP analysis has been established as an effective tool
to forecast
various aspects of the reactivity of chemical systems, including biomolecules.48,49,99 It has made a significant impact
in predicting the stabilities and reactivities of diverse organometallic
catalysts including first-generation Grubbs olefin metathesis catalysts;50 pincer catalysts;51 metal hydrides of Mo, W, Mn, Re, Fe, and Ru, which are applicable
as water-splitting catalysts;52 and so
forth. Recently, we have predicted the reduction potential (E0) values of mononuclear cobalt catalysts with
the help of MESP at the cobalt nucleus53 and also showed that E0 of organometallic
cobalt complexes can be fine-tuned using MESP at the metal center.
MESP is also used to characterize and quantify the electron-donating
ability of two electron ligands. Suresh and Koga54 characterized the lone-pair region of various substituted
phosphine ligands and quantified their electron-donating power with
the aid of MESP. MESP analysis has helped theoreticians and experimentalists
in understanding the stereoelectronic profile of phosphine ligands,
which led to the rational design of superior ligands.55 Quantification of steric and electronic effects of NHC
ligands toward metal coordination has also been carried out using
topographical analysis of MESP in which a linear correlation between
Tolman electronic parameter and electrostatic potential at carbene
carbon (VC) was established.56 Structure and reactivity of substituted arene–Cr(CO)3 complexes are also well-explained using MESP topography analysis.57 These studies of MESP have extensively helped
in understanding the chemical reactivity.

In organometallic
complexes, metal center plays the pivotal role
in executing a reaction, and a single parameter that explains the
reactivity of the metal center is yet to be established with respect
to a correlation with the activation barrier of the reaction. Further,
the question of how the selectivity of a ligand influences the performance
of the metal center in the rate-determining step of a reaction remains
unanswered. For the first time, we provide a mechanistic interpretation
of the oxidative addition of aryl halides to Pd(0) solely based on
the MESP at the Pd center, which undergoes delicate changes with respect
to changes in the ligand environment. MESP is an electronic property,
and the quantification of it on the metal center provides an easy
measure of the activation barrier of the oxidative addition. Thus,
a novel use of MESP is unraveled in this work, which will also establish
this quantity as an excellent electronic parameter for the direct
quantification of the chemical reactivity.

We have carried out
the oxidative addition of aryl bromide, aryl
chloride, aryl fluoride, and toluene to Pd(0) centers ligated with
phosphines, NHCs, alkenes, and alkynes. As there is an increasing
tendency to replace traditional phosphines with NHCs in organic synthesis,
this work will also enable the comparison of the suitability of phosphine
and NHC ligands. Several groups have tried to make Pd–phosphines
and Pd–NHCs more bulky to ease the oxidative addition; however,
the molecular design strategies were not based on a quantitative measure
for the electron-rich/-deficient character of the metal center. MESP
at Pd(0) gives a convenient measure of the ability of Pd(0) to undergo
oxidative addition, and its calculation is available with many computational
software. Our findings will pave the way for developing a rational
design strategy for making efficient ligands in oxidative addition.

Ligands and MESP Features
The selected
sets of ligands
are depicted in Figure 1. The abbreviation ImNX2Y2 is used for naming
the NHC ligands, where ImN represents the imidazole core unit while
X and Y represent the N and C substituents, respectively.

Figure 1 Schematic representation
of ligands selected for the study.

In Figure 2, MESP
isosurface at −20.0 kcal/mol (−0.0319 au) is plotted
for a representative set of optimized ligands along with their MESP
minimum [a (3, +3) critical point (CP)] Vmin in kilocalorie per mole. This figure also depicts MESP value in
au at the nucleus of phosphorus (VP) for
phosphines, at the carbene carbon (VC)
for NHC, at the alkyne carbon (VC), and
at the alkene carbon (VC). The MESP value
at the nucleus is very high compared with the Vmin. Hence, in Tables 1–4, the relative values of VP and VC with respect to their respective unsubstituted
systems PH3, ImNH2H2, C2H2, and CH2CH2 are reported along
with their Vmin and ΔVmin values (usually, the term “unsubstituted”
indicates that the substituent is H). ΔVmin is the difference between the Vmin of the ligand and that of the unsubstituted reference ligand. The
notations used for the relative values for phosphorus and carbon nuclei
are ΔVP and ΔVC, respectively.

Among the phosphines, PCy3 shows the most
negative Vmin (−43.1 kcal/mol)
followed by PtBu3 (−42.4 kcal/mol). Vmin of PiPr3, PMe3, and PEt3 (∼−40.0 kcal/mol) lies
very close
to PCy3, whereas a significant reduction in the negative
character of Vmin is observed for PPh3 (−30.7 kcal/mol). The ligands PCl3, PCF3, and PF3 do not have Vmin, indicating the high electron-withdrawing nature of their P substituents
(Table 1). Similarly,
the ligands PH2CF3, PCl2Ph, and PCl2Me show substantial decrease in the negative character of Vmin, suggesting the electron-deficient nature
of these ligands.61 For a particular ligand,
the negative sign of ΔVmin indicates
the electron-donating nature and the positive sign indicates the electron-withdrawing
nature. A trend very similar to Vmin is
observed for ΔVP, ΔVN, and ΔVC for most of the ligands (Tables 1–4). Nearly, a twofold
increase in the negative character of Vmin is observed for NHC compared with phosphines, which suggests that
the lone pair of NHC is more electron-rich and more electron-donating
toward coordination bonds than phosphine. A detailed elucidation of
MESP analysis for several phosphines and NHCs is stated elsewhere.54,62 Very recently, Suresh, Gadre, and co-workers have shown that MESP Vmin characterizes lone pairs in molecules.63,64 In the case of alkyne ligands, amino-substituted C2(NH2)2 and C2(NMe2)2 show the most negative Vmin, whereas
the severe withdrawing effect of F substituents in C2F2 leads to the disappearance of the negative MESP region for
the CC triple bond. Similarly, alkyl-substituted alkenes show the
most electron-rich double bonds (Vmin ≈
−20 kcal/mol), whereas CF3- and CN-substituted cases
do not exhibit Vmin. The ΔVC follows a trend similar to that of ΔVmin for electron-withdrawing substituents, whereas
alkyl- and silyl-substituted systems appear more electron-rich than
amino-substituted systems in ΔVC than ΔVmin.

The discrepancy
may be due to the difference in the through-space
and through-bond interactions of the alkyl and amino groups; the former
is mainly through bond active via inductive effect, whereas the through-space
effect of the lone pair on the amino group may strongly influence
the absolute value of Vmin for the CC
π bond.

Dissociation of Pd–L from PdL2
As
stated in the Introduction, in the monoligated
pathway, the substrate is oxidatively added to a 12-electron active
catalyst (PdL), which is formed by the dissociation of the 14-electron
bisligated complex (PdL2). The MESP values at the Pd nucleus
of PdL2 and PdL are designated as VPd1 and VPd2, respectively. The VPd1 and VPd2 values
of phosphine-, NHC-, alkyne-, and alkene-ligated complexes are given
in Tables S1–S4 of Supporting Information. The negative character of these quantities decreases with increasing
electron-withdrawing power of the ligand. The relative values of VPd1 and VPd2 with
respect to the unsubstituted systems (ΔVPd1 and ΔVPd2) are useful
to make a quick comparison of the electron-donating/-withdrawing power
of the ligands. Tables 5–8 depict these MESP parameters along with the Pd–P distance d1 for PdL2, Pd–P distance d2 for PdL, and dissociation energy of L from
PdL2 (Edis) for phosphines,
NHCs, alkynes, and alkenes, respectively.

In both PdL2 and PdL complexes, the Pd–P
bond
length is the highest for the PtBu3-ligated
complex and the lowest for the PF3-ligated complex, which
suggest that the Pd–P distance increases with electron-donating
and bulky ligands. When the ligand is more electron-donating, ΔVPd values become more negative. The PCy3, PtBu3, and P(SiMe3)3 complexes show more negative ΔVPd2 and ΔVPd1 values.
The electron richness of the metal center is directly proportional
to its tendency to undergo oxidative addition. The Edis is more or less the same for Pd(0) complexes coordinated
with alkyl-/phenyl-substituted phosphines, whereas it decreases with
increasing electron-withdrawing effect by other ligands. A contradictory
correlation aspect can be immediately noted between d1 or d2 distances and Edis. The Pd–P bond shortening leads to
a decrease in the bond strength. In the case of alkyl-/phenyl-substituted
phosphines, the steric effect may retard the closer approach of the
ligand to the metal, whereas the electron-rich nature of the ligand
compensates it by providing more sharing of electrons in the Pd–P
bond. In the case of electron-withdrawing ligands, the Pd–P
bond is inherently weak because of the diminished electron density,
whereas the reduced steric effect decreases the bond length. In addition,
the back-bonding effect from metal to ligand may also influence the
bond strength.

From Table 6, it
is evident that the Pd–C distances of Pd coordinated to NHCs
fall on a narrow range of 2.03–2.05 Å for d1 and 1.95–1.97 Å for d2. The most negative ΔVPd1 and ΔVPd2 values are observed
when the coordinating ligand is ImNMe2H2, indicating
the high electron-donating character of the CH3 substituent
at the N atom of NHC. Except for ImN(CF3)2H2, all the dissociation energy fall in the narrow range of
40.8–41.5 kcal/mol. In the case of alkyne complexes, the Pd–C
distance in both Pd–L2 and Pd–L is higher
when C2(SiMe3)2 is employed as a
ligand. This is due to the steric influence of bulky SiMe3 substituent. The Pd–C1 and Pd–C2 distances of all the PdL complexes are the same, except that of
Pd(C2(NMe2)2); in this case, Pd–C1 is 2.133 Å and Pd–C2 is 2.051 Å.
The average of the two Pd–C distances is given in Table 7. Although the MESP
parameters clearly distinguish the electron-rich ligands from the
electron-deficient ones, the Edis values
do not show a correlation pattern with these parameters or a pattern
with the Pd–P bond distance data. This indicates that in addition
to the σ-donating electronic effect from ligands, binding of
the ligand to the metal is influenced by the steric effect and back-bonding
effect arising from the interaction of filled metal d orbitals and π* orbital of alkyne.

Among the PdL2 complexes of alkenes, the Cl, Br, F,
CF3, and CN systems show two different Pd–C bond
lengths while the rest of the systems show the same bond length for
all the four Pd–C bonds. Two examples, viz., Pd(CH2CMe2)2 and Pd(CH2CCl2)2, are shown in Figure 3 to illustrate this geometric feature. For those showing
different Pd–C bond lengths, the average bond distance is given
in Table 8. Overall,
the dissociation energies of alkenes (16.1–25.2 kcal/mol) are
found to be significantly smaller than other sets of ligands.

A typical energy-profile diagram for the
oxidative addition of Ph–X to Pd(PtBu3) is given in Figure 4. Pd(PtBu3) in the reaction is
generated by dissociating PtBu3 from Pd(PtBu3)2. The adduct of Ph–X
and Pd(PtBu3) (I1) subsequently passes through a transition state TS1 to form a tricoordinated product P1. In cases of Ph–Br and Ph–Cl, I1 is formed as a result of η2-type coordination of Pd to one of the ortho CC bonds of the
arene ring, whereas in cases of Ph–F and Ph–Me, the
η2-type coordination of Pd occurs on one of the meta
CC bonds (Figure S1 of Supporting Information). The Pd–C and Pd–P distances in P1 for aryl halides are found to be 1.98 and 2.51
Å, respectively, whereas those of toluene are found to be 2.02
and 2.49 Å, respectively. The Eact of oxidative addition of substrates follows the order PhF ≈
Ph–Me ≫ PhCl > PhBr.

the oxidative addition
of Ph–X to Pd(PtBu3).

Compared with the strong C–C and C–F
bonds, the weaker
C–Cl and C–Br bonds cleave with significantly less energy.
The Eact data for all the Pd(PR3) complexes are provided in Table 9. In general, electron-rich phosphines such as alkyl
substituted show lower Eact than those
with electron-withdrawing substituents.

Energy-profile diagram for the oxidative
addition of Ph–X
to the active catalyst Pd(ImNMe2H2) is given
in Figure 5. The Edis of NHC in Pd(ImNMe2H2)2 is 41.3 kcal/mol. The monoligated complex forms an
adduct I2 with Ph–X, which
subsequently passes through a transition state TS2 to form the product P2. The adduct formation of substrate with Pd(NHC) leads
to more energy lowering than that with Pd(PR3), whereas Eact data given in Table 10 show that NHC ligation is more favorable
for the reaction than PR3 ligation. The Eact for the substrate addition follows the order Ph–F
≈ Ph–Me ≫ Ph–Cl > Ph–Br. The
maximum Eact is observed for ImNMe2NO2, the least donating NHC ligand to Pd.

Energy-profile diagram for the oxidative
addition of Ph–X
to the active catalyst Pd(C2(NMe2)2) is given in Figure 6. The Edis of Pd(C2(NMe2)2)2 is 33.6 kcal/mol. For Ph–Br,
Ph–Cl, Ph–F, and Ph–Me, the adduct I3 formation takes place at relative energies
19.4, 20.4, 18.0, and 19.8 kcal/mol, respectively. With respect to I3, the oxidative addition is significantly
exothermic for Ph–Cl and Ph–Br, whereas the reaction
is highly endothermic for Ph–Me and Ph–F. All Eact values for adding Ph–X to Pd–alkynes
are given in Table 11. The presence of the F substituent in the alkyne ligand gives the
highest Eact in all the four cases of
additions, viz., 12.7, 17.6, 37.8, and 46.8 for Ph–Br, Ph–Cl,
Ph–F, and Ph–Me, respectively. Among all, the alkyne
with NMe2 substituent gives the least Eact, viz., 5.4, 11.1, 31.5, and 38.8 kcal/mol for Ph–Br,
Ph–Cl, Ph–F, and Ph–Me, respectively, which is
even less than that of phosphine complexes except for the case of
Ph–Br. These results support the findings of Ahlquist et al.
that alkynes are excellent ligands for Pd(0) complexes for oxidative
addition reactions.32

Energy-profile diagram for the oxidative
addition of Ph–X
to a representative Pd–alkene complex, Pd(CH2CEt2), is given in Figure 7. The Edis is 21.9 kcal/mol for
this complex. Association of Ph–X to the monoligated complex
leads to the formation of the adduct I4. The adduct formation stabilizes the complex by 8–11
kcal/mol. The oxidative addition of Ph–F and Ph–Me is
highly endothermic and passes through high-energy transition states
(TS4), whereas moderate values
of Eact, viz., 10.1 and 13.7 kcal/mol,
are observed for the cleavage of Ph–Cl and Ph–Br bonds,
respectively. Table 12 depicts the Eact values for adding the
four substrates to the Pd(alkene) complex. The least Eact is obtained for the Pd(CH2CEt2) complex, viz., 3.7, 10.2, 37.6, and 40.8 kcal/mol for Ph–Br,
Ph–Cl, Ph–F, and Ph–Me, respectively. Alkenes
with electron-donating ligands appear as excellent ligands for palladium.
The presence of substituents CF3 and CN makes the ligand
electron-deficient, leading to high Eact values.

Correlation Plot of ΔVPd2 versus Eact
Figure 8 depicts
ΔVPd2 versus Eact correlation plots corresponding
to phosphines, NHCs, alkynes, and alkenes. All cases show excellent
linear correlations, which strongly suggest that MESP at the palladium
nucleus serves as an effective electronic parameter for predicting Eact. From the linear equations in the graph,
the unknown Eact of a ligand can be calculated
by knowing the ΔVPd value. The Eact increases with an increase in the ΔVPd2 value (from negative to positive), meaning
that improving the electron density at the Pd nucleus by appropriate
ligation can improve the efficiency of oxidative addition. It is evident
from the correlation that all the ligands behave in a similar fashion
with respect to the substrates because the slope of the graph is fairly
close for most of them. Among all the substrates, Ph–Me is
the most difficult to cleave by oxidative addition followed by Ph–F.
In Pd(phosphine), Pd(NHC), and Pd(alkene), complexes, Ph–Me
and Ph–F, show a similar reactivity toward oxidative addition,
whereas in Pd(alkyne), the reactivity of Ph–F is significantly
higher than that of Ph–Me. The Pd(alkyne) complex formed with
electron-rich ligands emerged as the most promising systems for activating
Ph–F bonds under oxidative addition conditions.

Conclusions
In summary, we have investigated the C–Br,
C–Cl,
C–F, and C–C bond breaking via oxidative addition on
monoligated palladium catalysts. MESP-derived parameters Vmin and VPd emerge as good
measures to characterize the electron-rich/-poor character of the
ligands and the complexes. The steric effect influences the absolute
value of Vmin to some extent, whereas VPd reflects mostly the overall electronic effect
of the ligand environment at the nucleus. Both MESP parameters undergo
subtle variations with respect to change in the ligand environment.
With respect to a reference complex—typically the complex coordinated
with the unsubstituted ligand—the observed change in VPd (ΔVPd)
gives a measure of electron donation to or electron withdrawal from
the metal center. A linear correlation is established between MESP
at the Pd center and Eact. Ligands of
electron-donating nature favor oxidative addition reaction. Thus,
use of ligands showing strong electron-rich character can be proposed
as a common strategy for designing efficient catalysts susceptible
for oxidative addition. Alkenes and alkynes have shown excellent ligand
property to oxidative addition by Pd(0). Although the high energy
barrier observed for adding Ph–F and Ph–Me suggests
a nonfeasible reaction, the ΔVPd versus Eact correlations aid us to develop
feasible oxidative additions by tuning VPd via appropriate ligands. In summary, the MESP-based electronic parameter VPd emerges as an easy tool for fine-tuning the
reactivity of the Pd(0) catalysts.

Computational Methods
All the calculations have been carried out using Gaussian 09 suite
of programs.58 The B3LYP density functional
with the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set for all atoms except Pd and LANL2DZ
basis set for Pd is used for optimizing the molecular geometries.
This method abbreviated as B3LYP/BS1 is also used for vibrational
frequency calculation and MESP calculation. A minimum energy structure
shows zero imaginary frequency, and a transition state is characterized
with one imaginary frequency along the bond-breaking/-forming direction
of the oxidative addition. The energy profiles of the computed mechanisms
are derived from the total energy of the complexes. The MESP, V(r) at a point r in space is calculated by
the following equation 1  where ZA is the
charge on the nucleus A, which is located at the position RA, ρ(r′) is the electron density,
and N is the total number of nuclei in the molecule.
The MESP at a nucleus A (VA) is computed
by removing the nuclear contribution because of ZA from eq 1. The topographical analysis of V(r) is based on locating and characterizing the CPs. These are points
in space at which first-order partial derivatives of the V(r) vanish. A CP is represented as an ordered pair consisting
of rank and signature, which is grouped into (3, +3), (3, −3),
(3, +1), and (3, −1). A MESP minimum (Vmin) corresponds to a (3, +3) CP, which represents the potential
binding sites for electrophiles, and (3, −3) stands for a maximum,
whereas (3, +1) and (3, −1) denote saddle points. We have taken
the Vmin at lone-pair region of P in the
case of phosphines, lone-pair region of N in the case of NHCs, and
π regions in cases of alkynes and alkenes. The Vmin values are located numerically by computing MESP on
a three-dimensional grid using Gaussian 09.

Selection of 50
ligands from four categories leads to the study
of 250 complexes (including transition states) for elucidating the
mechanism of the oxidative addition of one-substituted benzene. Hence,
a total of 750 complexes are analyzed in this study. To understand
the effect of solvation (solvent = THF) and dispersion, the reaction
of aryl bromide with a selected set of 15 phosphine-coordinated complexes
is also described at the B3LYP-D3/BS1 level59 in conjunction with the self-consistent reaction field approach
with the “solvation model density” method60 as implemented in Gaussian 09 in the Supporting Information.58 We have also tested the SDD basis set for Pd along with dispersion
and solvation (B3LYP-D3/BS2) corrections for the test systems. The
B3LYP-D3/BS1 and B3LYP-D3/BS2 results for the tested systems show
close similarity to the B3LYP/BS1 results, and hence, only the data
on the latter are discussed.
