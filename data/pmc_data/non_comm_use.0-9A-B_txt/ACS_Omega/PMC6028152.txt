Dinucleoside
phosphoramidites containing a triazole internucleotide
linkage flanked by locked nucleic acid (LNA) were synthesized and
incorporated into oligonucleotides (ONs). ONs bearing both LNA and
triazole at multiple sites were obtained and their biophysical properties
including enzymatic stability and binding affinity for RNA and DNA
targets were studied. t-LNAs with four incorporations of a dinucleoside
monomer having LNA on either side of the triazole linkage bind to
their RNA target with significantly higher affinity and greater specificity
than unmodified oligonucleotides, and are remarkably stable to nuclease
degradation. A similar but reduced effect on enzymatic stability and
binding affinity was noted for LNA only on the 3′-side of the
triazole linkage. Thus, by combining unnatural triazole linkages and
LNA in one unit (t-LNA), we produced a promising class of ONs with
reduced anionic charge and potential for antisense applications.

Introduction
Antisense oligonucleotides
(ASO) are short single-stranded nucleic
acids (typically 15–25 nucleotides in length) that bind to
their RNA target in a sequence-specific manner and modulate translation
(protein synthesis) or RNA splicing.1 Unmodified
natural DNA or RNA strands are not optimum antisense candidates because
of their poor serum stability and modest binding affinity for RNA.
Chemically modified nucleic acids2−4 offer a promising alternative
to their unmodified counterparts and have been extensively studied
since the ASO concept was first introduced.5 Some of these modifications possess favorable biophysical properties,
which is evident from the recent success in the clinic.6,7 Despite this, ideal antisense candidates, with the desired characteristics
of efficient unaided cellular uptake, long serum half-life and high
RNA binding affinity and target specificity, remain elusive and there
is a need to explore new chemically modified nucleic acids.

Recently, we have been interested in backbone-modified oligonucleotides
(ONs) with a special focus on triazole-linked nucleic acids.8 A series of studies over the past decade led
us to a highly versatile and biocompatible six-atom triazole linkage
(monomer W, Figure 1).9−12 This and other triazole linkages13,14 have been
shown to improve the stability of modified ONs to degradation by DNase
enzymes.14−17 Unfortunately, the thermal stability of duplexes carrying triazole
internucleotide linkages is compromised by the modified backbone.13,15,17−23 This imposes a restriction on the use of triazole-linked oligonucleotides
in antisense applications, even though they possess the favorable
properties of resistance to enzymatic degradation and the lack of
anionic charge that can hinder cell uptake of natural DNA. Building
on the seminal work by Wengel,24 we have
previously shown16 that introducing a conformationally
restricted locked nucleic acid (LNA)25−27 next to the triazole
linkage (monomers X and Z, Figure 1) counterbalances the reduction
in binding affinity caused by the triazole, resulting in modified
ONs that bind to their RNA target with affinity similar to unmodified
ONs. Interestingly, Watts et al. found in contrast that LNA does not
stabilize duplexes containing a more rigid four-atom triazole linkage
internally.15 Thus, the biocompatible six-atom
triazole linkage and LNA (monomers X and Z, Figure 1) is a promising
combination and warrants further investigation.

and triazole-linked DNA and LNA
backbones investigated in this study. U: Phosphodiester-linked

(B) The general principle explored in this study, where B = nucleobase,
S = modified sugar (e.g., LNA), L = modified DNA backbone (e.g., triazole).
Enzymatic degradation of such structures cannot give rise to monomer
units that can enter the mononucleotide triphosphate pool in cells.
Hence, the modifications cannot be incorporated into genomic DNA or
RNA.

In our previous study, we incorporated
monomers W–Z into oligonucleotides
by ligating together two short ONs,
one with a 5′-azide group and the other with a 3′-propargyl
group.16 This approach was chosen for ease
of ON synthesis. However, multiple incorporations of the triazole
linkage into short ONs and the introduction of the linkage at the
ends of ONs is not practical using this strategy. Here, we report
the synthesis of dinucleoside phosphoramidites containing the triazole
linkage flanked by LNA as suitable building blocks for the efficient
and flexible incorporation of monomers W–Z into ONs using standard solid phase phosphoramidite DNA
synthesis methodology. Using this approach, 13-mer ONs with 1, 2,
or 4 incorporations of the modified monomers W–Z were readily obtained, enabling us to study their enzymatic
stability and hybridization (duplex-forming) properties. Monomer Z stands out among those tested; ONs carrying four incorporations
of Z are strikingly resistant toward nucleolytic degradation,
and show enhanced binding to RNA targets with improved affinity and
specificity relative to unmodified ONs. Thus, the combination of LNA
and the triazole linkage provides a new class of potentially significant
antisense oligonucleotide candidates.

Results and Discussion
Chemical
Synthesis
First, nucleosides with a 3′-O-propargyl group and 5′-azido group were prepared
(Scheme 1). Accordingly,
5′-O-(4,4′-dimethoxytrityl)-3′-O-propargyl-LNA 5-methylcytosine (1)16 and 5′-O-(4,4′-dimethoxytrityl)-3′-O-propargyl-5-methylcytosine (2)28 were reacted with benzoic anhydride to obtain
protected nucleosides 3 and 4 in yields
of 86 and 92%, respectively. 5′-Azido-LNA thymidine (6) was obtained from protected nucleoside 5(29) by removing the 3′-O-benzyl group followed by nucleophilic displacement of 5′-O-mesylate with azide. 5′-Azidothymidine (7, Scheme 2) was prepared
following a literature procedure.30

and 20 (28 μmol/g loading).

Dinucleosides 8–11, which contain
the triazole linkage with and without LNA, were prepared in good yields
(79–87%) by Cu(I) catalyzed alkyne azide cycloaddition reaction31,32 between nucleosides 3, 4, 6, and 7 (Scheme 2). 3′-O-Phosphitylation of 8–11 gave phosphoramidites 12–15 as suitable building blocks for incorporating monomers W–Z, respectively, into DNA via solid-phase
DNA synthesis. For introducing monomers W–Z at the 3′-end of ONs, dinucleosides 8–11 were loaded onto an activated amino-SynBase
resin (16) using N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC)
as the coupling reagent.

Hybridization Studies
Hybridization to Complementary
RNA Targets
Having dinucleoside
phosphoramidites in hand allowed multiple incorporations of the modified
monomers internally and at the termini of ONs. Hence, phosphoramidites 12–15 were used to introduce monomers W–Z, respectively, into chosen ON sequences
(Table 1). Six sequences
were prepared: ON1–ON2 with modified monomers at 3′-
or 5′-end, ON3–ON4 bearing modified monomers in the
middle region, ON5 containing two modifications in the middle, and
ON6 incorporating four modified monomers (at the ends and in the middle).
The modified ONs were then mixed with the complementary RNA sequences
in a 10 mM phosphate buffer containing 200 mM NaCl at pH 7.0 and the
melting temperatures (Tm) of the resulting
duplexes were determined from the UV melting curves (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Representative UV melting
curves for ON6 containing four triazole
linkages (where −t– = triazole). These are the most
heavily modified of all the oligonucleotides in Table 1. Additional melting curves are given in
the SI (Figure S1). DNA/RNA hybrid duplexes
containing four triazoles with no LNA or four triazoles with LNA on
the 5′-side are significantly less stable than the unmodified
duplex, whereas duplexes containing LNA on 3′-side of the triazole
linkages displayed thermal stability comparable to unmodified duplex.
Importantly, duplexes with LNA on both the 3′- and 5′-side
of the linkages were the most stable. Y-axis (% hyperchromicity)
was calculated as follows: [(A260 at T °C – A260 at 20
°C)/A260 at 20 °C] x 100.

UGA G. nd = not determined. p = phosphodiester backbone. L = LNA nucleotide. t = triazole backbone.

In accordance with the literature, duplexes formed
between triazole-linked
DNA and fully complementary RNA strands were less stable than the
unmodifed DNA/RNA duplex (compare monomer W with U). However, the drop in Tm caused
by the triazole linkage was fully compensated for by either the introduction
of LNA on the 3′-side (monomer X) or on both sides
of the linkage (monomer Z). This observation is in full
agreement with our previous study.16 Furthermore,
the binding affinity of ONs carrying the modified monomers (W–Z) at the 3′-end (ON1W–ON1Z) was comparable to that of the unmodified
ON (ON1U), suggesting that all the monomers are well
tolerated at this position. ONs bearing monomers W or Y at the 5′-end bind to their RNA targets with a slightly
lower affinity than the unmodified DNA strand (compare ON2U with ON2W and ON2Y, ΔTm of −2.5 and −3.3 °C, respectively).
In contrast, monomers X and Z with ΔTm of +1.7 and +0.8 °C (compare ON2U with ON2X and ON2Z), respectively,
induced a slight increase in binding affinity. A larger drop in thermal
stability was observed with incorporation of either W or Y at the center of modified duplexes (ΔTms in the range of −5.0 to −5.5
°C, ON3W, ON4W, ON3Y,
and ON4Y). In contrast, one incorporation of monomers X or Z increased the thermal stability (ΔTm of +0.6 to +3.0 °C, ON3X, ON4X, ON3Z, and ON4Z), with
monomer Z being more effective than monomer X (compare ON3X with ON3Z and ON4X with ON4Z). Indeed, monomer Z with LNA
sugars on both sides of the triazole linkage induced an increase of
3.0 °C (ON3Z) in Tm,
which is the largest increase in this series for a single modification.
Importantly, the thermal stability of a duplex with four incorporations
of monomer Z was significantly higher than that of the
unmodifed duplex (compare ON6U with ON6Z, ΔTm = +5.6 °C), and for
monomer X (with LNA on the 3′-side of the triazole),
a small increase in thermal stability was observed (compare ON6U with ON6X, ΔTm = +1.1 °C). In contrast, the modified duplexes carrying four
incorporations of monomer W (triazole linkage without
LNA) or Y (LNA on 5′-side of the triazole linkage)
were strikingly less stable than the unmodified duplex (compare ON6W or ON6Y with ON6U, ΔTm = −17.3 and −18.4 °C, respectively).

Hybridization to Mismatched RNA Targets
To avoid “off
target” effects that can lead to the inhibition of a wrong
mRNA, ASOs must be able to differentiate between matched and mismatched
RNA targets. ON3 with a backbone modification at the center was chosen
to assess the binding specificity of the modified monomers. The nucleotides
opposite to MeC or T on either side of the triazole linkage
were changed, and the Tm differences between
matched and mismatched duplexes were recorded (Table 2). In general, monomers W–Z discriminated between a matched and a single-mismatch target
with the efficiency similar to that of the unmodified base (U). Monomer W (triazole linkage without LNA)
was least effective in sensing a mismatched nucleotide. Monomer V (LNA without a triazole linkage) gave a good mismatch discrimination
in all the cases (e.g., compare ON3U with ON3V), which is in agreement with the literature.25 Monomer X, with LNA on the 3′-side
of the triazole linkage showed the greatest discrimination for a mismatched
nucleotide on the 3′-side of the triazole linkage. However,
marginally inferior discrimination was observed for monomer Y, which carries LNA on the 5′-side of the linkage.
Monomer Z, which has LNA on both sides of the triazole
linkage showed improved discrimination for the mismatch nucleotide
on the 3′-side of the triazole linkage (T–C and T–G
mismatch). Monomer Z discriminated against a mismatch
guanine base (T–G mismatch) with greater efficiency than that
of the unmodified ON (compare ON3U with ON3Z). The T–G mismatch discrimination for Z was
also noticeably superior to that observed for monomers X or V (compare ON3Z with ON3X or ON3V). The greater relative destabilization of the
T–G mismatch is significant, as this mismatch is generally
quite stable. The ability to discriminate between mispaired nucleotides
was then studied for ONs containing four incorporations of monomers X and Z (Table S2)
and similar results were observed. Again, significant destabilization
of duplexes containing a T–G mismatch was observed (compare
ON6Z with ON6U).

b ΔTm = change in Tm for a mismatch duplex
relative to the corresponding matched duplex. p = phosphodiester backbone. L = LNA nucleotide. t = triazole backbone. Matched RNA target:

(MeC–U mismatch), 5′-AGCAGAUAAUGAG (MeC–A mismatch), 5′-AGCAGAUCGUGAG (T–C
mismatch), 5′-AGCAGAUGGUGAG (T–G mismatch).

In summary, the combined hybridization
data (Tables 1 and 2) indicate that
LNA on the 3′-side of the triazole linkage maintains its beneficial
effects on RNA binding affinity and specificity, but this is not true
for LNA on the 5′-side of the triazole linkage. Our explanation
for this behavior is that LNA on the 3′-side of the triazole
is attached to a natural phosphodiester group, but when present on
the 5′-side of the triazole, the LNA sugar is attached to a
more flexible triazole linkage. LNA stabilizes DNA/RNA duplexes by
reducing phosphate backbone flexibility,24,33 which may not be possible when the LNA sugar is attached directly
to the more flexible modified linkage and/or is close to an unstable
mismatched base pair.

Hybridization to DNA Targets
Next,
modified ONs were
mixed with their DNA targets in a buffer containing 10 mM phosphate
and 200 mM NaCl at pH 7.0 to give DNA/DNA duplexes and Tms were recorded. These were then compared with the Tm of the unmodified DNA/DNA duplex and differences
(ΔTms) were determined (Table 3). In all the cases,
the thermal stabilities of the modified duplexes were lower than those
of the unmodified duplexes (negative ΔTms). However, as observed for DNA/RNA duplexes, modifications
were better tolerated at the 3′-end relative to other positions
(ΔTms only in the range of −0.8
to −1.7 °C, compare ON1W–ON1Z with ON1U). A large drop in Tm was observed for monomer W at internal
positions, which is consistent with the literature (compare ON3W and ON4W with ON3U).19,20 Surprisingly, monomers X and Z were better
accommodated at the center of the duplex compared to the 5′-end,
and the thermal stability of the modified duplex incorporating monomer Z in the center was similar to that of unmodified duplex (compare
ON3Z with ON3U, drop of only 1.5 °C).
As with the DNA/RNA duplexes, monomer Z gave the highest
melting temperatures for all DNA/DNA duplexes. It is not surprising
that the triazole–LNA combination stabilizes the DNA/RNA duplexes
to a greater degree than it does the DNA/DNA duplexes. This is because
the LNA sugar exists in the C3′-endo conformation, which occurs
in A-type helices (DNA/RNA and RNA/RNA) but is disfavored in DNA/DNA
duplexes in solution.24,34

Circular
Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy
CD spectra of
the modified duplexes obtained by mixing ON6 (ON6U–ON6Z, Table 1)
with RNA targets were recorded in a buffer containing 10 mM phosphate
and 200 mM NaCl at pH 7.0 and the results are shown in Figure 3. Neither LNA nor the triazole
linkage significantly alters the global conformation of the DNA/RNA
duplexes (compare ON6V–ON6Z with
ON6U). However, subtle shifts in CD maxima near 272 nm
were observed. For instance, the CD spectrum of the duplex containing
LNA but no triazole linkage (monomer V) displayed a maximum
at 263 nm (a hypsochromic shift of 9 nm). For duplexes containing
LNA on the 3′-side or both sides of the triazole linkage (monomers X and Z), the CD maxima were observed at around
267 nm (a hypsochromic shift of 5 nm), whereas monomer W (triazole linkage but no LNA) or monomer Y (LNA on
the 5′-side of the linkage) did not induce a noticeable shift
in their CD maxima. Interpretation of these shifts in terms of DNA
conformation is not straightforward, but the changes are modest, and
overall geometry of the duplexes carrying LNA–triazole modifications
is likely to be similar to the unmodified DNA/RNA duplex. Nevertheless,
an interesting and significant trend emerges. The hypsochromic shifts
observed for LNA-containing duplexes in Figure 3 are in line with previously reported data34 and could be attributed to enhanced A-form-geometry
due to the restricted conformational mobility of LNA. Assuming that
flexible triazole linkages partially (triazole–3′-LNA)
or almost totally (5′-LNA–triazole) eliminate beneficial
LNA-driven A-form conformational changes, the extent of the hypsochromic
shift should decrease in the following order: ON6V (uncompensated
LNA effects) > ON6X and ON6Z (partially
compensated LNA effects) > ON6Y (almost totally compensated
LNA effect) > ON6W and ON6U (no LNA,
zero
shift). The relative magnitudes of these hypsochromic shifts are also
proportional to differences in melting temperatures, precisely as
would be expected.

Enzymatic Stability of t-LNAs
Oligonucleotides ON6U–ON6Z (Table 1) were incubated with phosphodiesterase 1
from Crotalus adamanteus, snake venom
(3′-exonuclease), in 50 mM Tris buffer containing 10 mM MgCl2 at pH = 9.0 to determine their resistance to nucleolytic
degradation. Aliquots were taken over different time intervals and
analyzed by 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (Figure 4). Figure 4A shows a direct comparison
between the unmodified DNA strand (ON6U), an ON containing
eight LNAs but no triazole linkage (ON6V) and an ON with
four incorporations of monomer Z (ON6Z,
best candidate from thermal melting data). It is evident that multiple
incorporations of monomer Z render the modified ON remarkably
resistant to degradation by snake venom. After 3 h, ON6Z is clearly visible, whereas both ON6U and ON6V are fully degraded. Next, the enzymatic stability of ON6W, ON6X, and ON6Z was compared (Figure 4B). This shows that
the introduction of LNA next to the triazole improves stability against
this nuclease, with ON6Z being more stable than ON6X, which, in turn, is more stable than ON6W.
It is surprising that this 3′-exonuclease cleaves ON6W so readily, as this must require the removal of an entire
triazole-linked dinucleotide from the 3′-end of the oligonucleotide
(by digestion of the closest available unmodified phosphodiester linkage).
In contrast, the extreme stability of ON6Z to snake venom
phosphodiesterase shows that there is a synergistic effect between
LNA and triazole, justifying the modified DNA linkage design on which
this study is based.

stability against nucleases. Digestions were performed using snake

= 9.0. (A) Comparison of nuclease stability of ON6U,

Next, the stability of ON6V–ON6Z in fetal bovine serum (FBS) was
tested and compared with that of
the unmodified ON6U (Figures 5 and S2). FBS
contains predominantly endonucleases, so it has different enzymatic
DNA degrading activity to snake venom, which is a 3′-exonuclease.
FBS was chosen for this study because it will simulate the extracellular
conditions to which a therapeutic oligonucleotide would be exposed.
ONs were incubated with FBS (50%) in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered
saline (DPBS). Unmodified DNA (ON6U) was completely digested
within 4 h of incubation, whereas both ON6Z and ON6V were stable for up to 8 h (Figure 5A). The observation that LNA enhances the
resistance of triazole-linked ONs against nucleolytic degradation
in serum was further supported by the fact that ON6Z (LNA
on both sides of the triazole linkage) is more stable (visible up
to 24 h) than the ON6X (LNA only on 3′-side of
the linkage), and the observation that ON6W containing
triazole linkages without LNA is less stable (Figure S2). Interestingly, ON6V (eight LNAs)
was more stable in serum than ON6X (four triazole linkages
and four LNAs), whereas ON6V and ON6Z with
eight LNA sugars have similar stability (both stable up to 24 h).
This confirms that LNA is a significant contributor to enzymatic stability
in serum. The triazole linkage (monomer W) is a mimic
of phosphodiester linkage and is biocompatible,35 so it might be able to bind to serum endonucleases in a
fashion similar to unmodified linkage and allow adjacent phosphodiesters
to be cleaved (ON6X has eight unmodified phosphodiester
linkages). In contrast, LNA has a locked sugar (3′-endo), which
could inhibit the binding of nucleases to the single-stranded ON.
To summarize, t-LNAs with LNA on either side of the triazole linkage
have the highest stability against nucleolytic degradation, in addition
to the strongest affinity for RNA targets.

Conclusions
The efficient synthesis
of dinucleoside phosphoramidites containing
a triazole linkage and LNA sugars has been achieved. Access to these
dinucleoside phosphoramidites allowed the incorporation of the triazole
linkage flanked by LNA at multiple positions in oligonucleotides,
including the central region and the 3′- and 5′-ends.
This was not feasible with our earlier ligation-based strategy where
short ONs were joined together using click chemistry. There are several
examples of a short triazole linkage being introduced into oligonucleotides
via phosphoramidite monomers, but in all the cases, the duplexes were
greatly destabilized.21−23 There is also one report of this short triazole being
combined with LNA and added to oligonucleotides by phophoramidite
chemistry, but unlike our triazole, this particular linkage was strongly
duplex-destabilizing despite the presence of LNA.15 Another study described the synthesis of triazole-linked
DNA by phosphoramidite chemistry using an inverted version of the
triazole unit employed in this study, and this linkage slightly destabilized
double-stranded DNA.17 In contrast, in
this study, we have shown that oligonucleotides (t-LNAs) that contain
the triazole linkage in Figure 1 flanked by LNA on the 3′- or both sides (monomers X and Z, respectively) bind to their RNA targets
with higher affinity and specificity than the equivalent unmodified
ONs. In addition, t-LNAs containing multiple incorporations of monomers X and Z are highly resistant to nuclease degradation,
and there is a synergistic effect on enzymatic stability from the
combined triazole–LNA linkages. Further biochemical and biological
studies are required, but so far the indications are that t-LNAs constitute
a promising class of oligonucleotides with potential antisense and
splice-modulating applications.36 They
display extreme stability to enzymatic degradation, high RNA-binding
affinity and RNA target specificity, and reduced anionic charge. The
effects on cellular uptake of reducing the overall anionic nature
of oligonucleotides by incorporation of LNA–triazole linkages
will be interesting to study, given that oligonucleotide delivery
is a major issue in therapeutic applications. The dinucleotide phosphoramidite
strategy described in this article also allows for the synthesis of
LNA triazoles, which incorporate phosphorothioate linkages, which
might further enhance cell uptake. It is also possible that such oligonucleotide
analogues will have different toxicological properties than LNA because
it is not possible for any of the LNA–triazole dimers to be
degraded into LNA nucleotides, so they cannot enter the mononucleotide
triphosphate pool and therefore they cannot be incorporated into genomic
DNA or RNA. The results presented here and previously16 suggest that, in addition to potential therapeutic applications,
modified t-LNAs could find uses in imaging, diagnostics, and nontherapeutic
siRNA applications.

Experimental Section
All the reagents
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Alfa Aesar,
Fisher Scientific, or Link Technologies and used without further purification.
Pyridine (from KOH) and POCl3 were freshly distilled before
use, and THF was obtained using the MBraun SPS Bench Top solvent purification
system (SPS). All air/moisture-sensitive reactions were carried out
under inert atmosphere (argon) in an oven-dried glassware. Reactions
were monitored by thin-layer chromatography using Merck Kieselgel
60 F24 silica gel plates (0.22 mm thickness, aluminum backed). The
compounds were visualized by UV irradiation at 254/265 nm and by staining
in p-anisaldehyde solution. Column chromatography
was carried out under pressure using Biotage SNAP Ultra columns. The
columns were primed with CH2Cl2 containing 1%
pyridine before use for all DMTr-containing compounds. 1H and 13C spectra were measured on a Bruker AVII 500 spectrometer
at 500 and 126 MHz, respectively. Chemical shifts are given in parts
per million and were internally referenced to the appropriate residual
solvent signal, all coupling constants (J) are quoted
in hertz (Hz). Assignment of compounds was aided by correlated spectroscopy,
heteronuclear single quantum coherence, heteronuclear multiple bond
correlation, and distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer-135
experiments. The high-resolution mass spectra were measured on a Bruker
9.4 FT-ICR-MS mass spectrometer, and the samples were run in MeOH.

Synthesis of Oligonucleotides
Standard DNA phosphoramidites,
solid supports, and reagents were purchased from Link Technologies
and Applied Biosystems. LNA phosphoramidites were obtained from Exiqon.
Automated solid-phase synthesis of oligonucleotides (trityl off) was
performed on an Applied Biosystems 394 synthesizer. The synthesis
was performed on 1.0 μm scale involving cycles of acid-catalyzed
detritylation, coupling, capping, and iodine oxidation. Standard DNA
phosphoramidites were coupled for 60 s, whereas extended coupling
time of 10 min was used for the modified phosphoramidites including
LNA phosphoramidites. Modified phosphoramidites 12, 13, 14, and 15 were used to prepare
ONs with monomers W, X, Y,
and Z respectively. Coupling efficiencies and overall
synthesis yields were determined by the inbuilt automated trityl cation
conductivity monitoring facility and were ≥98.0% in all the
cases. The oligonucleotides were then cleaved from the solid support
and protecting groups from the nucleobase and backbone were removed
by exposure to concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide for 60 min
at room temperature followed by heating in a sealed tube for 5 h at
55 °C. RNA was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies BVBA,
Leuven, Belgium.

Purification of Oligonucleotides
The fully deprotected
oligonucleotides were then purified by reverse-phase high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Gilson system using a Luna 10 μm
C8(2) 100 Å pore Phenomenex column (250 × 10 mm2) with a gradient of acetonitrile in triethylammonium bicarbonate
(TEAB) over 20 min at a flow rate of 4 mL/min. Buffer A: 0.1 M TEAB,
pH 7.5; buffer B: 0.1 M TEAB, pH 7.5, with 50% acetonitrile were used.
Elution was monitored by UV absorption between 260 and 295 nm. A gradient
of acetonitrile in hexylammonium acetate (HAA) over 20 min at a flow
rate of 4 mL/min was used to purify oligonucleotides, which were not
separable using a gradient of acetonitrile in TEAB. Buffer A: 0.1
M HAA, pH 7.5; buffer B: 0.1 M TEAB, pH 7.5, with 50% acetonitrile
were used. The elution was monitored by UV absorption between 260
and 298 nm.

Thermal Denaturation Experiments
UV DNA melting curves
were recorded in a Cary 4000 Scan UV–vis spectrophotometer
using 3 μM of each oligonucleotide in a 10 mM phosphate buffer
containing 200 mM NaCl at pH 7.0. The samples were annealed by heating
to 85 °C (10 °C/min) and then slowly cooling to 20 °C
(1 °C/min). Six successive cycles (heating and cooling) were
performed at a gradient of 1 °C/min and the change in UV absorbance
at 260 nm was recorded. The melting temperature was calculated from
the first derivative of the melting curve using an in-built software.

Snake Venom Phosphodiesterase Stability
Five nanomole
of oligonucleotide was dissolved in 100 μL buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl,
10 mM MgCl2, pH = 9.0). Twenty microliter of this solution
was removed as a control (0 min). To the remaining solution was added
2 μL aqueous solution of phosphodiesterase 1 from C. adamanteus venom (from Sigma-Aldrich, catalogue
number P3243, 0.45 units, dissolved in 7 mL H2O). The reaction
was incubated at 37 °C and aliquots (20 μL) were taken
at different time intervals, mixed with formamide (20 μL), and
stored at −20 °C. The samples were then analyzed by denaturing
20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Serum Stability
Five nanomole of oligonucleotide was
dissolved in 50 μL Dulbecco’s PBS and 50 μL of
FBS (Gibco, standard (sterile-filtered)) was added. The sample was
thoroughly mixed by vortexing before 20 μL of this solution
was removed, mixed with formamide (20 μL), and stored at −80
°C as a control (0 h). The remaining reaction mixtures were incubated
at 37 °C and aliquots (20 μL) were taken at different time
intervals, mixed with formamide (20 μL), and stored at −80
°C. The samples were then analyzed by denaturing 20% polyacrylamide
gel.

CD Spectroscopy
CD spectra (200–340 nm) were
recorded on a Chirscan Plus spectropolarimeter using a quartz optical
cells with a path length of 5.0 mm. The scans were performed at 10
°C using a step size of 0.5 nm, a time per point of 1.0 s, and
a bandwidth of 2 nm; the average of four scans is presented. Duplexes
were prepared by mixing 3 μM of each oligonucleotide in a 10
mM phosphate buffer containing 200 mM NaCl at pH 7.0 and annealed
by heating to 85 °C and then slowly cooled to 10 °C before
recording the CD spectrum. A CD spectrum of the buffer alone was recorded
and subtracted from the collected data.
