Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)
are useful devices in converting
renewable solar energy into electrical energy. In DSSCs, the triiodide
reduction at the surface of TiO2 is one of the detrimental
processes that limit the realization of high efficiencies of the device.
To alleviate the active sites available on the semiconductor surface
for this detrimental process, the interfacial modification of the
dye-adsorbed TiO2|electrolyte interface has been attempted
by coadsorption of oleic acid (OA) over the TiO2 surface.
Thus, the modified cell exhibited a higher efficiency (η) of
12.9% under one sun illumination when compared with that of the unmodified
cell (η = 11.1%). To provide an insight into the OA anchoring
and dynamics of electron transport at the photoanode|electrolyte interface,
molecular spectroscopic and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic
analyses were carried out. A red shift in the optical absorption spectrum
was observed after the addition of OA to dye-adsorbed TiO2. The binding of OA to TiO2 surface was found to be through
bridging bidentate type. Mott–Schottky analyses of the DSSCs
under dark conditions were made to probe the shift in the Fermi level
of TiO2 upon OA modification. In addition, the Förster
resonance energy transfer (FRET) has been found between OA and N719
dye. Thus, the red shift in the optical absorption, enhanced electron-transfer
kinetics, and FRET contributes to the observed enhancement in the
efficiency of the device containing OA-modified photoanode.

Introduction
Renewable energy resources,
such as wind and solar, are receiving
tremendous attention as supplements in meeting the ever-increasing
energy demand and in reducing the dependence on fossil fuels and alarming
levels of global warming.1 Solar energy
conversion is an economically viable choice to cater the elevating
energy demands of the modern society. Among the third generation solar
cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been paid substantial
attention because of the ease of fabrication and cost-effectiveness
as compared with the conventional silicon-based solar cells.2 High photoconversion efficiency (PCE) is one
of the indispensable key parameters to the commercialization of DSSCs
to meet the energy demands. Theoretically a high PCE of 18% has been
shown possible by overcoming the VOC–JSC trade-off by designing new sensitizers with
extended light absorption till near IR region and with new red-ox
couples.3 Multitudinous approaches have
been made to improve the PCE of DSSC, viz, (i) design and synthesis
of sensitizing dyes with broader absorption up to near infrared region,4 (ii) finding new red-ox couples with higher reduction
potential than that of I3–/I– to improve the open-circuit voltage (VOC),5 (iii) using coadsorbents to prevent
the competitive adsorption among dye molecules and to avoid the photoexcited
state quenching,6 and (iv) administering
new additives to overcome VOC–JSC trade-off and surface passivation of photoanodes
to retard the charge recombination.3 Particularly,
DSSCs comprising metal-free organic dyes and Co(III)/Co(II) redox
electrolyte have shown a PCE of 14.7% by collaborative sensitization
process.7 All these reveal that there is
a large prospect to improve the PCE of DSSCs further.

One
of the major causes for the loss in the efficiency of
DSSC is the charge recombination at the photoanode|electrolyte interface.
Earlier reports have shown the possibility to modify the photoanode|dye
molecule interface to suppress or eliminate the loss mechanism by
coating the photoanode surface with a thin layer of insulating oxides8,9 or a higher band edge semiconductors.10,11 In one
such attempts, Sewvandi et al. have modified the TiO2 photoelectrode with the organic silane molecules and studied the
effects of molecular structure of silanes, alkyl chain length, and
TiO2 surface coverage by silane molecules on the back electron-transfer
reaction rate.12 Kakiage et al. have demonstrated
cosensitization using two metal-free silyl anchored dye with antireflecting
film and observed the high incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency
upto 88%.13

However, all of the efforts
were made to modify the TiO2 surface prior to the dye loading
which significantly reduces the
amount of dye adsorption and electron injection rate from the dye
to TiO2. To reduce the charge recombination at photoanode
and electrolyte interface without affecting the electron-transfer
rate, Son et al. have deposited a transparent silica layer on the
exposed areas of the photoanode through which the adsorption of dye
molecules was significantly reduced and 36% enhancement in the PCE
versus uncoated devices was achieved.14 An organic silane layer was incorporated in between TiO2 and the perovskite for printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells
to tune the interfacial electronic structure and to passivate the
recombination process.15 Similarly, Zuo
et al. have reported that the ZnO-based photoelectrode when modified
with self-assembled monolayer of 3-aminopropanoic acid exhibited a
low photogenerated charge recombination and high carrier lifetime
in perovskite solar cells.16 Furthermore,
the iodine binds with the thiocyanate ligand of N719 dye through its
lone pair of electrons and leads to unfavorable effects on the DSSC
performance. Mazloum-Ardakani and Khoshroo demonstrated that the oleic
acid (OA) prevents the charge recombination and reduces the surface
concentration of dye-iodine complex via saturating the π-bond
of OA by iodine present in the electrolyte.17 OA-capped TiO2 was used in DSSC along with resorcinol-based
Ru(II)–Re(I) complexes and higher electron lifetimes were observed
because of the resorcinol binding.18 Recently,
OA has also been shown as a blue emitter and a sensitizer of rare-earth
luminescent centers when anchored over different oxide surfaces.19 Thus, it is important to understand the role
of OA that is anchored over dye-adsorbed TiO2 surface and
its implications on DSSC performance.

Hence, the interfacial
engineering of photoanode to overcome the VOC–JSC trade-off,
suppress the recombination losses, enhance the charge injection rate
from sensitizer to semiconductor, and understand the mechanisms of
the aforementioned phenomena will help in designing DSSCs with higher
PCE. With this motivation, in this work, we have used OA, a long chain
omega-9 fatty acid (Figure S1), to modify
the surface of TiO2-based photoanode after N719 dye adsorption.
OA molecules are selectively adsorbed at the naked surface of TiO2 that is free from the dye molecules. Thus, the entire exposed
area of TiO2 is covered by dye and OA molecules. These
OA molecules are expected to block the recombination processes occurring
at the TiO2|electrolyte interface without affecting the
charge injection from the photoexcited dye molecule to TiO2. An enhanced PCE of 12.9% has been achieved with this approach,
and a detailed understanding of the mechanism is presented here.

Results
and Discussion
To illustrate the effect of OA on the photovoltaic
performance,
the DSSCs with unmodified and OA-modified TiO2 photoanodes
were fabricated. The fabricated devices were evaluated under the illumination
of 100 mW/cm2 with the optical filter of AM 1.5G. Figure 1A shows the current
density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of DSSCs with the active area of 0.16 cm2. The photovoltaic parameters obtained from the J–V measurements of DSSCs with unmodified
and OA-modified TiO2 photoanode are compared in Table 1. The OA concentration
is 1.00 mM in these results. The short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF) are 24.3 mA/cm2,
0.769 V, and 0.69, respectively, which led to the PCE of 12.9% for
the DSSC with OA-modified TiO2 photoanode. The high JSC is a combined result of the reduced recombination
of injected electron with oxidized electrolyte, enhanced optical absorption,
altered electronic structure, effective charge injection from the
dye to TiO2, and improved charge transport kinetics.

the DSSCs with unmodified and OA-modified TiO2 photoanodes
(A) under 100 mW/cm2 and AM 1.5G illumination and (B) under
dark conditions. The OA concentration in the OA-modified TiO2 photoanode is 1.00 mM.

Table 1 J–V Characterization
of the DSSCs under AM 1.5G Simulated
Sun Light (100 mW/cm2)
device	VOC (V)	JSC (mA/cm2)	FF	η (%)	
TiO2/dye	0.779	20.7	0.69	11.1	
TiO2/dye/OA	0.769	24.3	0.69	12.9	
The optimized OA concentration of 1.00 mM was arrived
at by carrying
out experiments with DSSCs comprising TiO2 photoanodes
modified with different OA concentrations (0.25, 0.50, 1.00, and 1.50
mM). The J–V curves and their
characteristics of these DSSCs (other than the one shown here) are
presented in Figure S2 and Table S1 (Supporting Information), respectively. With increasing OA concentration,
a systematic decrease in VOC was observed,
and this can be attributed to the downward shift in the quasi-Fermi
energy (Ef) level of TiO2.
The DSSC with the lowest concentration of OA (0.25 mM) exhibited a
PCE of 10.7%. Upon increasing OA concentration to 0.5 mM, the PCE
also increased to 11.3% and further increase in OA concentration to
1.5 mM decreased the PCE to 10.0%. Thus, the optimum concentration
of OA was found to be 1.00 mM in this work. To find the influence
of OA on the morphology of TiO2, the field emission scanning
electron microscopic (FE-SEM) and atomic force microscopic (AFM) analyses
of the unmodified and OA-modified TiO2 (with OA concentration
of 1.00 mM) film coated on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates
were carried out. The FE-SEM images of unmodified and OA-modified
TiO2 films (Figure S3, Supporting Information) show the porous structure formed by the uniform spherical nanoparticles
of the size ∼30 nm and the added OA did not make any distinct
difference in the morphology. Similarly, not much difference in the
morphology and topography was found in the AFM images as well (Figure S4). The transmission electron microscopic
(TEM) analyses of the unmodified and OA-modified TiO2 powders
showed an identical morphology and crystallinity (Figure S5) of the samples. Thus, there is no influence of
OA on the morphology of TiO2 nanoparticles and this could
be due to the low concentration of OA.

In general, the recombination
of photoinjected electrons in the
conduction band (CB) of TiO2 with oxidized electrolyte
I3– occurs when it is in contact with
TiO2 surface where no dye molecules are present.12 The blocking of this recombination can be understood
by comparing the dark current measurements, and Figure 1B shows the results obtained for the devices
with unmodified and OA-modified TiO2 anodes. Under dark
conditions, the dye molecules are inactive to act as sensitizer. Instead
they act as a blocking layer on TiO2 surface preventing
the interaction of I3– with the surface.
From Figure 1B, it
is clear that the dark current density of the device with OA-modified
TiO2 anode is lower than that of the cell with unmodified
anode. As the TiO2 surface is covered with OA molecules
in addition to dye, the dye-modified TiO2|electrolyte interface
is altered. This inhibits the I3– to
contact the TiO2 surface resulting in the lower dark current
density. These results indicate that the OA molecules anchored on
the TiO2 surface block the active sites for the charge
recombination process, that is, the electron transfer from the transparent
conducting oxide to I3– via TiO2.

In DSSC, the extended light absorption by the single sensitizer
till the near IR region is critical in realizing a good photovoltaic
performance. The standard N719 dye was used in this work because of
its high molecular stability and promising photovoltaic performance
in the presence of I3–/I– redox couple.20 The aggregation of excessively
adsorbed dye molecules showing a blue shift in the optical absorption
limits the PCE of DSSC. Hence, preventing the dye aggregation with
additives like cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, and their derivatives
enhanced the PCE.21 The optical absorption
spectra of dye-adsorbed photoanode with and without OA modification
are compared in Figure 2A. It is observed that upon OA modification, there is a significant
red shift in the absorption spectrum. There could be a rearrangement
of already anchored dye molecules over TiO2 surface during
OA adsorption. The formation of J-aggregates of dye can result in
the red shift in its optical absorption and this is favored by the
presence of an additive, for example, OA in the present study, or
the acidic pH of the solution during OA addition.21 This is possible by leaching out of excessively aggregated
dye molecules from the TiO2 surface upon OA treatment.6 The amount of N719 dye present in the unmodified
and OA-modified TiO2 photoanodes was measured by washing
with NaOH (0.1 M in ethanol and water solution, 1:1 vol %). The amounts
of desorbed dye from the unmodified and OA-modified TiO2 photoanode were 5.9 × 10–5 and 5.1 ×
10–5 mol/cm2, respectively, indicating
the lower concentration of dye in OA-modified TiO2 which
can be attributed to the leaching out of dye molecules during immersion
of the TiO2/dye photoanode in OA solution. Thus,
the red shift observed in the optical absorption of dye molecule resulted
in the enhanced the PCE for the cell with OA-modified photoanode.

absorption spectra of unmodified and OA-modified
TiO2/dye coated FTO glasses. (B) DRUV–vis absorbance
spectra of pristine and OA-modified TiO2 powders. The inset
shows the spectrum of OA-modified TiO2 by using TiO2 as baseline reference.

To understand further the red shift in the optical absorption
spectrum
upon OA coadsorption, we recorded the diffuse reflectance UV (DRUV)–vis
absorbance spectra of pristine and OA-modified TiO2 powders.
As shown in Figure 2B, the absorbance shows a slight increase in the entire visible region
of the spectrum in the case of OA-modified TiO2. This enhanced
absorbance can be attributed to the creation of surface states as
observed in the case of OA-anchored ZnAl2O4:Eu3+ and BiPO4:Eu3+ phosphors.19,22 To clearly observe this, the DRUV–vis spectrum of OA-modified
TiO2 was recorded using pristine TiO2 as baseline
reference. The spectrum obtained is the difference spectrum and shows
only the absorbance from the surface states created because of anchoring
of OA over TiO2 surface. The inset in Figure 2B clearly reveals an increased
absorbance from 800 to 330 nm with a maximum at ∼360 nm. This
result clearly shows the creation of new surface energy states upon
OA coadsorption over TiO2, and these states that form the
mid-gap energy levels could play a role in enhancing the electron
transport.

Figure 3 (A) FT-IR spectra of pure OA and TiO2 modified with
OA (TiO2/OA) and (B) XPS C 1s spectrum of TiO2/OA.

To obtain more insights into the
binding of OA molecules over TiO2 surface, we recorded
the Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectra (Figure 3A)
of pure OA and OA-anchored TiO2 (TiO2/OA). The
spectrum of pure OA shows the characteristic peak at 1707 cm–1 which is assigned to the carbonyl stretching mode of the carboxylic
acid group.23 In the FT-IR spectrum of
TiO2/OA, the absorption due to carbonyl stretching mode
of OA at 1711 cm–1 disappeared and a new absorption
band at 1604 cm–1 is observed. This shift indicates
that the OA molecules are chemically bonded over TiO2 surface
rather than by simple physisorption.24,25 Furthermore,
the metal-carboxylate band in the region 1300–1700 cm–1 can be used to deduce the binding mode of the carboxylic acid on
metal centers. The carboxylate anion (−COO–) shows asymmetric and symmetric stretching bands because of its coordination
with the “Ti” centers. The binding nature of the carboxylate
anion on the TiO2 surface can be deduced from the difference
in the wavenumbers between the asymmetric and symmetric stretching
bands, Δ (=νas – νs), in the metal-carboxylate band region.26 The characteristic bands at 1600 and 1456 cm–1 are assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of
carboxylate group, respectively. The calculated difference (Δ)
is 144 cm–1 which reveals that the OA molecules
are anchored over TiO2 surface through bridging bidentate
mode.27 The absorptions at 1418 and 723
cm–1 are assigned to the umbrella stretching mode
of −CH3 group and rocking mode of −CH2 groups, respectively, of OA.28

Further to infer the binding mode of OA molecules on TiO2 surface, the X-ray photoelectron  spectra (XPS)
of TiO2 and TiO2/OA were recorded. Figure 3B shows the C 1s
spectrum of TiO2/OA that was deconvoluted into four distinct
bands indicating four
different carbon species derived from OA. The most intense band centered
at 285.5 eV corresponds to the aliphatic carbon atoms while the band
at 284.8 eV is assigned to ethylene carbon atoms (−C=C−)
of OA. The peaks at 287.0 and 289.8 eV are assigned to the monodendate
and bidendate carboxylate carbon atoms of OA upon binding over TiO2.26 The absence of peak at 290
eV is an indication for the absence of free −COOH group.29 Thus, OA capping over TiO2 surface
through the bridging bidentate coordination is confirmed from these
results. The XPS spectrum of Ti 2p level (Figure S6) has shown two distinct peaks at 459.7 and 465.5 eV corresponding
to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 levels, respectively. The
bands upon OA modification has broadened and shifted toward lower
binding energy, indicating a change in the electronic environment
of Ti upon OA anchoring over TiO2 surface.

To elucidate
the charge transport mechanisms of the DSSCs, electrochemical
impedance spectroscopic (EIS) analyses of illuminated DSSCs were carried
out under open-circuit voltage conditions. The experimental data (Figure 4) were fitted using
an equivalent circuit model as shown in Figure 4A.30 Electron
transport parameters have been calculated as reported in the literature31−35 and are listed in Table 2. The components such as RS, RCT1, and RCT2 in
the equivalent circuit correspond to the total series resistance,
charge-transfer resistance at the Pt|electrolyte interface, and recombination
resistance at TiO2|dye|electrolyte interface, respectively.
The RS value is slightly increased for
the device with OA-modified photoanode (Table 2). The RCT2 of
the cell with OA-modified TiO2 photoanode is 10.04 Ω
which is lower than that of the cell comprising the unmodified TiO2 (11.12 Ω). One might expect that the OA-modified device
had suffered with charge recombination. However, it is important to
note that the added OA moiety prevents the back electron transfer
from TiO2 to I3– as evidenced
from the dark current measurements (Figure 1B). To obtain further insights into this
phenomenon, the effective rate constant for the recombination reaction
(Keff) was calculated from the impedance
analysis.31 The OA-modified device has
shown a rate constant of 16.36 s–1 which is marginally
lower than that of the unmodified device suggesting that the OA moieties
slow down the kinetics of back electron-transfer process.

TiO2/dye/OA	17.7	10.04	6.08	61.12	16.36	0.09	6.12 × 1018	
Furthermore, the electron lifetime (τ) was calculated
for
both the devices and the values are listed in Table 2. The device with OA-modified TiO2 shows a τ value of 61.12 ms which is slightly higher than
that of the unmodified device (61.08 ms). Bode phase plots are presented
in Figure 4B and it
can be seen that the frequency is lowered for the OA-modified device,
suggesting a longer electron lifetime. VOC decay measurement was carried out and found that OA-modified device
shows a slower decay profile suggesting a longer electron lifetime
(Figure S7). Finally, it is clear that
upon OA modification, the rate of back electron transfer is precluded.

The variation in the chemical capacitance (Cμ) is a good estimate of the charge accumulation in TiO2.31 The increased Cμ for the OA-modified device (6.08 mF) results in
the increased electron density in TiO2. Steady-state electron
density (ns) was calculated for the fabricated
DSSCs. The device with OA-modified photoanode has a higher electron
density of 6.12 × 1018 cm–3 than
that of the unmodified device (5.51 × 1018 cm–3). This result further supports the high PCE of the
interfacially modified DSSCs.36 In addition,
it can be seen from Table 2 that the post modification of OA on TiO2|dye photoanode
decreased the electron transport resistance (Rt) of the TiO2 film. Hence, the photoinjected electrons
are transported through the TiO2 network and reach the
external  circuit in an efficient manner without any impediment.

Further, to elucidate the influence of OA modification on the charge
transport mechanisms of the DSSCs, EIS experiments were carried out
under dark conditions with different applied bias potentials,
and the results are presented in Figures 5 and 6. Figure 5A shows that the cell comprising
OA-modified TiO2 photoanode has a higher capacitance than
that of the cell with unmodified photoanode suggesting that TiO2 CB edge is shifted to positive potential upon OA modification.
This downward shift is responsible for the decreased VOC of the OA-modified DSSC (0.769 V vs 0.779 V of device
with unmodified TiO2). At lower bias potentials, TiO2 behaves as an electrical insulator and under this condition
the recombination takes place predominantly at the uncovered FTO surface.
While increasing the bias potential, the TiO2 becomes conductive
and the electrons are allowed to diffuse through the TiO2 film, and now the recombination takes place at the TiO2 surface.37,38Figure 5B shows an increase in the charge recombination
resistance at photoanode|electrolyte interface for the OA-modified
device while forwarding the bias potential from  0.80 to
0.85 V, suggesting that the adsorbed OA molecules over the naked surface
of TiO2 passivate the exposed TiO2 surface and
prevent the electron transport to the electrolyte. In addition, the
electron transport resistance is lower in the entire range of the
bias potentials for the OA-modified DSSC (Figure 5C) and these results are in good agreement
with the calculated Rt values under illumination
(see Table 2). A higher
value of RCT2/Rt is required for the low charge recombination rate, a high charge
collection efficiency, and high photovoltaic performance of a DSSC.
The ratio RCT2/Rt for OA-modified device was calculated to be 111.5, which
is higher than that of unmodified device (50.05) and hence the photoinjected
electrons are collected effectively via TiO2 network upon
OA modification. These results further support the increased PCE of
the OA-modified device. Electron lifetime has been calculated at various
bias potentials and presented in Figure 5D. The electron lifetime of DSSC with OA-modified
TiO2 is slightly higher while increasing the bias
potential (>0.75 V) and this strongly suggests that the OA
moieties
prevent the charge recombination process and thus improve the overall
device performance.  To establish the role of OA modification
over the charge-transfer properties of TiO2, EIS measurements
were carried out in a three-electrode setup for unmodified and OA-modified
TiO2 films using I3–/I– electrolyte in acetonitrile. Lithium perchlorate (0.1
M) was used as a supporting electrolyte. The EIS Nyquist plots are
shown in Figure S8 and the difference in
the semicircular arcs shows that the charge-transfer resistance and
conductivity of TiO2 have improved with OA modification.
The charge-transfer resistance (RCT) at
the electrode|electrolyte interface for the OA-modified TiO2 is smaller (1.24 kΩ) than that of the unmodified TiO2 (29.8 kΩ). Thus, OA modification is favorable in improving
the charge-transfer kinetics of TiO2 and enhancing the
DSSC performance.

electron density with respect to the applied
bias potentials under dark condition. (B) M–S plots measured
at a frequency of 1 kHz of the DSSCs with unmodified and OA-modified
TiO2 photoanodes under dark condition.

Figure 6A
shows
that the steady-state electron density of the OA-modified device is
higher than that of the unmodified device in the entire range of the
applied bias potential. This can be due to the increased chemical
capacitance as well as the downward shift of the CB of TiO2 after OA modification that leads to the higher short-circuit current
density and enhanced PCE. In DSSC, one of the important parameters
that is crucial in realizing a high PCE is VOC, derived from the energy difference between the quasi-Fermi
level (Ef) of TiO2 and the
reduction potential of the red-ox couple (I3–/I–).3 Hence, VOC of DSSC can be enhanced by either shifting
the Ef toward the negative potential or
using a red-ox electrolyte with more positive potential. Table 1 shows that upon interfacial
modification of cell with OA, the VOC of
the device decreased when compared with the unmodified device
with a difference of 10 mV. A similar trend was observed with different
OA concentrations (Table S1) as well. To
establish the position of Ef, Mott–Schottky
(M–S) analyses were carried out for DSSCs under dark conditions.
The applied potential was varied between −1.0 and +1.0 V to
probe the shift in Ef of TiO2 due to the adsorbed OA molecules at the TiO2/dye surface.39Figure 6B illustrates the typical M–S plots of DSSCs with unmodified
and OA-modified TiO2/dye photoanodes. The intercept of
the straight line at the abscissa in Figure 6B corresponds to the Ef of the TiO2. The Ef values of the devices fabricated using unmodified and OA-modified
(1.00 mM) TiO2 photoanodes are −0.441 and −0.431
V versus I3–/I–, respectively.
This indicates that upon OA modification, the Ef of TiO2 is shifted toward positive direction with
respect to the red-ox potential of the electrolyte (Eredox) and thus decreases the VOC, that is, the energy difference between Ef and Eredox. The surface modification
of TiO2 with acid results in a positive shift of the quasi-Fermi
level while the treatment with a base results in the shift of the Ef toward negative potential.40 Consequently, a decrease in VOC (∼10 mV) has been observed upon OA modification in the present
study. However, this shift toward positive direction is favorable
for the efficient charge injection from the dye molecule to TiO2 CB (Scheme 1). In addition, the built-in-potential (difference between the Ef value of OA-modified and unmodified TiO2 photoanodes) in the device upon OA modification of TiO2 was found to be 10 mV and it is the main driving force for
the enhanced charge separation and minimized back electron transfer
from TiO2 to I3–. It is also
expected that this positive shift of Ef will increase the work function of TiO2 photoanode, as
the work function is the energy required to promote an electron from Ef to vacuum. This difference is partially attributed
to the electron withdrawing nature of the −COOH group of OA
moiety that directs the dipole away from the TiO2 surface.41 Hence, upon interfacial modification of photoanode
using OA not only prevents the charge recombination process but also
augments the facile charge injection from the dye to CB of the TiO2.

As mentioned earlier, OA also acts as an emitter
and a sensitizer.19 Hence, understanding
the optical properties
of OA and its interaction with N719 dye will provide further insights
into the observed enhancement in the PCE. The photoluminescence (PL)
emission spectrum of OA while being monitored using 365 nm excitation
wavelength falls in the blue region of visible spectrum (Figure 7A) where N719 dye
absorbs. Thus, there could be an electronic interaction between OA
and N719 through energy transfer. Förster resonance energy
transfer (FRET) involves a dipole–dipole interaction between
two chromophores, called the donor and the acceptor.42 Upon excitation of the donor (OA), the excited
energy can be transferred nonradiatively to the acceptor molecule
(N719) if there is a spectral overlap between the absorption spectrum
of acceptor and the emission spectrum of donor. Here, the absorption
spectrum of N719 dye effectively overlaps with the emission spectrum
of OA (Figure 7A) and
contributes to the FRET in an efficient manner. The coadsorption of
OA on TiO2 along with N179 dye ensures that the FRET donor
can strongly interact with the FRET acceptor N719 dye, thus introducing
an in situ FRET system.43 Further evidence
for this FRET was obtained from the quenching of the emission
of OA upon addition of N719 dye (Figure 7B). Consequently, the JSC of the OA-modified device was greatly improved because of
the enhanced light harvesting ability of N719 along with OA.44 A comparison of reported efficiencies in the
literature for DSSC and perovskite solar cells using different coadsorbents
(Table S2, Supporting Information) shows
that the obtained efficiency of 12.9% in the present work is higher
than the ones reported. Our results show the promising nature of OA
modification of TiO2 surface to enhance the PCE of DSSC
through the combined effects of the enhanced optical absorption and
minimizing the photoinjected electron recombination at the TiO2|electrolyte interface.

Figure 7 (A) Optical absorption spectrum of N719
and PL emission spectrum
of OA in dimethylformamide, excited using 365 nm wavelength. Concentrations
of OA and N719 were fixed as 0.02 mM. (B) Quenching of the PL emission
(decreasing intensity) of OA upon addition of increasing concentrations
of N719 is observed.

Conclusions
In summary, the interfacial engineering of the
N719 dye-anchored
TiO2 photoanodes using OA has allowed us to achieve a high
PCE of 12.9% when coupled with I3–/I– redox couple under one sun illumination. The OA molecules
anchored over TiO2 surface through a bridging bidentate
coordination altered the optical absorption of dye-anchored TiO2 film. The red shift in the optical absorption of dye-anchored
TiO2 film is due to the rearrangement of dye aggregates
and leaching out of excess dye molecules. Also, OA anchoring over
TiO2 surface introduces surface electronic states that
could help the facile charge-transfer process. Upon OA modification, Ef of TiO2 shifted toward the positive
potential, and this favors the effective charge injection from the
highest occupied molecular orbital level of dye molecule to the CB
of TiO2. The dipole formed at the dye-TiO2/OA|electrolyte
interface passivates the charge recombination process without affecting
the charge injection from the dye to TiO2. The mechanism
of the enhanced PCE with OA as elucidated using EIS analyses suggests
that OA molecules not only suppress the back electron-transfer rate
but also facilitate the charge injection process and improve the charge
transport kinetics. In addition, we found that the in situ FRET occurring
between OA and dye is also responsible for the observed high PCE.
This work further stimulates the search for new organic or organic-inorganic
hybrid surface modifiers to realize high efficiencies of DSSCs.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals and Reagents
All chemicals used in this study
were of analytical grade. TiO2 (P25), chloroplatinic acid
hexahydrate, OA (99%), 1,3-dimethyl-3-propyl-imidazolium iodide (DMPII,
98%), lithium iodide (LiI, 99.9%), iodine (I2, 99.9%, metal
basis), tertiary butyl pyridine (TBP, 96%), and guanidine thiocyanate
(GSCN, 99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich India Pvt. Ltd. FTO-coated
glass (FTO glass, 3.2 mm thickness, sheet resistance 15 Ω/□)
was purchased from Xin Yan Technology Ltd., Hong Kong. N719 dye was
purchased from Solaronix S.A. (Switzerland). Other reagents were purchased
from TCI India Pvt. Ltd., India, and used as received.

Device Fabrication
The detailed procedure for the fabrication
of DSSCs is as follows: FTO glasses were cut into plates of dimension
2.0 × 1.5 cm2 and were cleaned in detergent solution,
distilled water, acetone, and ethanol in an ultrasonic bath, and the
glasses were subjected for UV/O3 treatment. The blocking
layer of TiO2 was deposited by spin-coating the acidic
solution of titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, 97%) and sintered
at 450 °C for 30 min. The pure anatase phase was extracted from
the commercial titania TiO2–P25 by the method reported
in the literature.45 To an ice-cooled aqueous
solution of H2O2 (30%, 200 mL), aqueous NH3 (2.5%, 32 mL) was added under magnetic stirring. P25 powder
(2.0 g) was added to the H2O2–NH3 mixed solution and stirred for 12 h. The pale yellow colored
reaction mixture was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 30 min, washed several
times with distilled water, and dried at 80 °C in air. The dried
powder was calcined at 500 °C in air for an hour to obtain the
pure anatase TiO2. The anatase phase formation was confirmed
by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Figure S9). Then, a film of TiO2 whose thickness was found
to be 12 μm (see Figure S10 for the
cross-sectional FE-SEM image) was coated by doctor blade method using
the paste prepared by grinding isolated anatase TiO2 nanoparticles
(0.5 g) with 0.15 g of polyethylene glycol (MW—35 000), 0.10
g of polyethyleneoxide (MW—100 000), Triton-X-100 (two drops),
and 3.5 mL of 0.1 M glacial acetic acid for an hour. The whole content
was allowed to stir for 24 h. The obtained paste was coated on to
a cleaned FTO glass and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. The TiO2-coated glasses were cooled to 70 °C and immersed in
0.3 mM solution of N719 in tert-butyl alcohol–acetonitrile
mixture (1:1) for overnight. The dye-coated film was washed copiously
with absolute ethanol to remove the unadsorbed dye molecules and dried
over the N2 flow. For OA modification, the TiO2/dye-coated films were immersed in ethanolic solution of OA (1.00
mM) for 3 h and washed thoroughly with absolute ethanol and dried
under nitrogen flow.

The counter electrode was prepared by drop-casting
a solution of chloroplatinic acid (5 mM) in isopropyl alcohol over
FTO glass and heated at 420 °C for 15 min in air. The dye-coated
TiO2 or OA-modified TiO2/dye film was sandwiched
with a predrilled platinum-coated FTO counter electrode. The two electrodes
were separated by hot melt polymer film (thickness 60 μm, Meltonix-1170-60).
The red-ox electrolyte consists of 0.6 M DMPII, 0.05 M LiI, 0.03 M
I2, 0.5 M TBP, and 0.1 M GSCN in the mixture of acetonitrile
and valeronitrile (85:15), was injected into the device, and sealed.
The active area of the fabricated DSSCs is 0.16 cm2.

Characterization
Optical absorption spectra of the
films of unmodified and OA-modified TiO2/dye-coated FTO
glasses were obtained using an UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer
(Cary 5000, Varian). The optical absorption spectrum of N719 dye solution
was recorded using a spectrophotometer (UV-3600 Plus SHIMADZU). DRUV–vis
absorption spectra were recorded using a spectrometer (Cary 5000,
Varian) with an integrating sphere attachment. Spectralon diffuse
reflectance standard was used as baseline reference. The morphologies
of TiO2 and OA-modified TiO2 in the films coated
over FTO glass and its cross section were analyzed using FE-SEM (Supra
55VP, Carl Zeiss). The AFM (Agilent Technologies 5500) images of unmodified
and OA-modified TiO2-coated FTO glasses were analyzed to
find the topographies. The TEM images of TiO2 and
OA-modified TiO2 powder samples were obtained using an
FEI Technai 20-GZ microscope. FT-IR spectra of OA and OA-modified
TiO2 were recorded using a spectrometer (TENSOR 27, Bruker).
Powder XRD patterns of TiO2 (P25) and anatase TiO2 were obtained using Cu Kα radiation (1.5418 Å, D8 ADVANCE,
Bruker). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis (ESCA Lab
250Xi, Thermo Scientific) was carried out with a  Al Kα
source (1486.6 eV) to obtain information about the chemical states
of TiO2 and OA-modified TiO2. All of the electrochemical
experiments were carried out using a potentiostat–galvanostat
(SP-150, Bio-Logic). The photovoltaic performances of fabricated devices
were tested at 100 mW/cm2 with the optical filter of AM
1.5G using a solar simulator (Sciencetech-AAA) coupled with Keithley-2400
voltmeter. EIS measurements were carried out under alternating current
amplitude of 10 mV and in the frequency range from 105 to
10–2 Hz. M–S analyses were carried for the
DSSCs under dark conditions at 1 kHz of frequency. Room-temperature
PL spectra were recorded using a spectrofluorometer (FP-8500, JASCO).
