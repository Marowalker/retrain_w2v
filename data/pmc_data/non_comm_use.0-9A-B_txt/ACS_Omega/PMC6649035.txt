Described
in this work is the synthesis of a novel dicyano-substituted N-2-aminoethyl-4-(3-pyridinyl)-2-pyridone organic compound
(1) that is characterized by several spectroscopic methods.
Compound (1) was utilized for the preparation of its
perchlorate (2), chloride (3), and bromide
(4) salts. Single-crystal X-ray structures of these three
salts were determined, and noncovalent weak interactions involving
the aromatic rings, anions, and water molecules in (2–4) were investigated in detail. Solid-state
UV–vis spectrum of the reported compounds (1–4) was utilized to calculate their optical band gaps, which
clearly indicated that they belong to the semiconductor family. Under
illumination condition, the magnitudes of electrical properties of
(1) and its salts (2–4) improve remarkably although the improvement differs from salt to
salt and the result was analyzed theoretically. Salt (2) was tested for its DNA binding ability.

Introduction
Development of organic-based
semiconducting materials has gained
sufficient interest nowadays over the metal–organic semiconductors
because of their facile manufacturing and processing, lower production
cost, flexibility, light weight, and trouble-free way of deposition
of films over a large surface.1−6 These kind of semiconducting materials have applications in various
technological fields and in optoelectronic devices, like photoconductors,
sensors, organic light-emitting diodes, memory devices, organic field
effect transistors, etc.7−13 In spite of these advantages, the electrical transport property
for organic semiconductors might be expected to be poor than that
of the conventional inorganic semiconductors because of the absence
of metals. However, salt formation of organic compounds introduces
ionicity, which enhances relatively weak electrical transport properties
of organic semiconductors14−16 and salt forms can exhibit lower
band gap than their base forms.17,18 The design and synthesis
of the solid-state supramolecular architecture of organic molecules
through molecular self-assembly has experienced dynamic growth throughout
the years.19−24 From the view of noncovalent interactions, crystals of an organic
compound are considered as the “ultimate supermolecule”
because they are connected via relatively weak forces in comparison
with interactions present in inorganic compounds.20,25 Salt formation of these organic molecules through protonation can
exclusively introduce a variety of additional noncovalent interactions
as the counter ions formed during protonation can participate in noncovalent
interactions like anion···π, anion···π+, π···π+, and π+···π+, which can give a new
orientation to the existing structure.26−30 Besides, in semiconducting materials, the extent
and effectiveness of charge transport is governed by the relative
orientation of components of participating molecules in a solid state.31−35

2-Pyridone core represents a diverse group of fascinating
organic
compounds having a broad spectrum of biological and pharmacological
activities.36−40 Some 2-pyridone derivatives can be prepared through very rapid and
economic one-pot multicomponent coupling reactions.41,42 Apart from this, the way of salt formation of these 2-pyridone derivatives
is very elegant and getting the crystal form of salts is quite rapid.

In the present study, we have synthesized 1-(2-aminoethyl)-6-hydroxy-2-oxo-4-(3-pyridinyl)-1,2-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarbonitriles
(1) and three of its salts [perchlorate (2), chloride (3), and bromide (4)] (Figure 1). We have established
the X-ray crystal structures of these salts and explored noncovalent
interactions in their solid-state structure. We have also studied
the electrical and photoresponse properties of (1) as
well as its salts (2–4) to examine
whether salts of this compound can improve the above-mentioned properties.
The observed experimental band gaps (2–3 eV) indicate that
they are wide-band gap semiconductors (WBGS)43,44 and thus should have electronic properties in between those of typical
semiconductors and insulators, allowing these materials to be potential
candidates for operating at elevated temperatures, currents, and frequencies
than traditional semiconductors.45−47 WBGS materials are the
key components used to fabricate LEDs and lasers, in some specific
radio frequency function, specifically in military radars. Their intrinsic
characteristics induce the potentiality for a broad area of application,
and they are considered as the foremost contestants for the next-generation
devices.48−50 Moreover, considering the biological importance of
our synthesized organic compounds, we have also explored the interaction
of CT-DNA with one of the salts (2) in aqueous buffer
medium.

Results and Discussion
Crystallographic Analyses
Compounds (2–4) contain substituted
2-pyridone moiety with
one protonated pyridine ring (ORTEP diagram and atom-numbering scheme
of the cationic moiety is given in Supporting Information, Figure S1) along with different anions and solvent
water molecules in their asymmetric units. Figure 2 represents the X-ray single-crystal structures
of compounds (2–4) (crystal data
and structure refinement parameters for (2–4) are provided (Table S1)). The
protonated pyridine ring (C1–C5/N1) and the substituted 2-pyridone
ring (C6–C10/N2) are designated as “ring A” and
“ring B”, respectively (Figure S1). Variation in the torsion angle between two aromatic rings and
different orientations of the ethylammonium moiety (Figure 2) play a major role in differentiating
solid-state structural arrangements as well as optical properties
among the three salts.

Figure 2 X-ray structures of compounds (2–4) (a–c, respectively) with indication of the bis-arene
torsion
angle.

The molecules of (2) are stabilized in the solid state
through proper arrangement of hydrogen bonds, like N–H···O,
C–H···O, and O–H···O along
with lp···π, lp···π+, anion···π, and anion···π+ interactions (Tables S2 and S3). The protonated pyridine nitrogen is the H-bond donor to the water
molecule that concurrently interacts with the carbonyl oxygen atom
from an adjacent molecule, thus forming a dimeric R44(20) ring motif (M). Moreover, the perchlorate ion becomes
a double H-bond acceptor (from water and ammonium), forming a dimeric
R66(26) ring (N). Interconnection between the
rings M and N leads the molecules to propagate along [001] direction
(Figure 3a), forming
an alternate MNMN infinite chain. A second water molecule simultaneously
performs as an H-bond donor and acceptor to the carbonyl oxygen atom
and ammonium group, respectively, and interconnects the (N) rings
along [100] direction. Thus, solvent water molecules play a vital
part in forming the supramolecular network structure in (2), which spreads on the (101) plane (Figure 3a). Moreover, the solid-state structure of
(2) shows that the two oxygen atoms of perchlorate anion
are oriented toward the π-cloud of the B-ring and A-ring in
the molecule. The separation distances between the oxygen atoms and
the centroids are 3.396(2) and 3.436(2) Å, respectively. Thus,
the perchlorate anion binds the cationic moiety through anion···π51,52 and anion···π+ interactions and
generates a dimeric molecular moiety (Figure 3b). Finally, the N atoms of the −C
≡ N substituent interact with the centroids of the B-ring and
A-ring with a separation distance of 3.817(2) and 3.699(2) Å,
respectively. These lp···π53,54 and lp···π+ interactions also generate
a dimeric motif that propagates along [100] direction (Figure 3c). Interestingly, in the opposite
face of the π-clouds of both A and B rings, the O atoms of the
perchlorate anion connect the ring centroids through anion···π+ and anion···π interactions. Thus, two
types of lp···π+/π+···anion and lp···π/π···anion
networks are generated in the solid-state assembly of (2) (Figure 3c).

ring motifs, (b) dimeric unit generated through mutual anion···π
and anion···π+ interaction, and (c)
perspective view of the lp···π+/π+···anion and lp···π/π···anion
network in (2).

The crystal structure of (3) is stabilized through
N–H···Cl, O–H···Cl, N–H···N,
N–H···O, O–H···O, C–H···N,
C–H···O hydrogen bonds, π···π
stacking, lp···π, and anion···π+ interactions (Tables S2–S4). The protonated pyridine ring nitrogen atom N(1) acts as an H-bond
donor to N(4) that governs the generation of an infinite one-dimensional
zigzag chain along [010] direction. On both sides of this chain, the
Cl ion acts as a double H-bond acceptor to the protonated pyridine
nitrogen atom and ammonium group. The interconnection of the N–H···N
and N–H···Cl bonds directs the molecules to
form a two-dimensional network in (011) plane (Figure 4a). Furthermore, the interconnection between
pyridine nitrogen and amine nitrogen atoms with chlorine anion and
the role played by the water oxygen atom generate a different supramolecular
framework in (101) plane (Figure 4b). The ammonium group acts as an H-bond donor to the
carbonyl oxygen atom, forming a centrosymmetric R22(14) ring (Figure 4c). In both sides of this dimeric unit, chloride ion acts
as a double H-bond acceptor and a water molecule acts as a double
H-bond donor, forming a two-dimensional supramolecular framework in
(101) plane (Figure 4c). Furthermore, the carbonyl oxygen is in contact with the centroid
of the ring-B with a separation distance of 3.955(2) Å, revealing
the formation lp···π interactions in (3) (Figure 4d). Interestingly,
on both sides of the dimer, cyano N-atom forms lp···π
interaction with the B-ring, with a separation distance of 3.111(3)
Å. The combination of O···π and N···π
leads the molecules to form an infinite lp···π/π···lp
network (Figure 4d).
Finally, one C–H bond is in contact with the centroid of ring-A,
forming a C–H···π+ interaction,
and in the opposite side of the ring, the chloride ion is oriented
toward the π-face of the ring, establishing an anion···π+ interaction with a separation distance of 3.422(2) Å.

in (101) plane, (c) supramolecular framework in (101) plane, and (d)
network through multiple lp···π interactions
and anion···π+ interactions in (3).

The molecules of (4) exhibit N–H···Br,
N–H···N, N–H···O, C–H···Br,
C–H···N, and C–H···O hydrogen
bonds and π···π stacking and lp···π
and anion···π+ interactions (Tables S2–S4). The protonated pyridine
N atom acts as an H-bond donor to one CN group, generating a centrosymmetric
R22(16) dimeric ring (M) (Figure 5a). On both sides of the dimeric ring motif,
the ammonium group acts as an H-bond donor to the carbonyl oxygen
atom, forming a centrosymmetric R22(14) dimeric
ring (N) (Figure 5a).
Bifurcated H-bonding interactions are established between the RNH3+ groups and the Br– ion to form
the P-type dimer with a characteristic R42(8)
ring (Figure 5a). Thus,
the interconnection of the zero-dimensional dimeric ring motifs M,
N, and P guides the molecules to form a 2D supramolecular network
in (4) (Figure 5a). Moreover, a centrosymmetric R22(18)
dimeric ring (Q) is generated through the formation
of bifurcated C–H···NC and N–H···NC
interactions (Figure 5b). Additional reinforcement between the molecules is given by a
pair of C–H···N H bonds (Q-motifs, see Figure 5b) to form a tetrameric
network. Interconnection of the dimeric and tetrameric ring motifs
leads the molecules to propagate a network structure in (101) plane.
The molecular packing in (4) also shows the formation
of lp···π interactions. That is, the carbonyl
oxygen atom is oriented toward the π-cloud of the B-ring with
a separation distance of 3.519(6) Å (to the ring centroid), thus
forming a dimer. At the opposite side of the ring, the N atom also
establishes an lp···π interaction with B ring; N···Cg(B) separation distance is 3.413(6) Å.
The occurrence of these two lp···π contacts produces
an lp···π/π···lp network
by interconnecting two dimers in (4) (Figure 5c). Moreover, the Br atom establishes
an anion···π+ interaction with ring
A with a separation distance of 3.712(2) Å.

dimeric motifs and a two-dimensional
assembly, (b) dimeric and tetrameric motifs as a building block of

Optical Characterization
For optical characterization,
thin films of compounds (1–4) were
prepared on normal glass substrate from the stable dispersion of the
compounds in dimethyl formamide. Solid-state UV–vis spectra
of the films (inset, Figure 6) were recorded for the determination of optical band gaps.
Direct optical band gaps were calculated using Tauc’s equation55 (eq S1); the values
were found to be 2.92, 2.17, 2.63, and 2.55 eV (Figure 6) for (1–4), respectively.

Figure 6 UV–vis spectra (inset) and Tauc’s plots
for compounds
(1–4) (a–d, respectively).

Electrical Characterization
Calculated optical band
gaps of (1–4) resemble the semiconducting
nature of the compounds. Therefore, metal (Al)–semiconductor
(our prepared compounds) (MS) junction thin-film devices have been
fabricated. To study the electrical parameters of the devices, we
have analyzed the charge transport behavior through the MS junction.
The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of (1–4)-based
multiple devices, measured with a Keithley 2635B sourcemeter under
dark conditions with AM 1.5 G at the corresponding applied bias voltage
sequentially within the limit ±2 V are presented in Figure 7a,b.

Figure 7 I–V characteristic curve
for indium tin oxide/compound (1–4)/Al structured thin-film devices under (a) dark and (b) illumination
conditions.

Under dark conditions,
estimated conductivity values for (1–4)-based devices were found to be 1.14
× 10–6, 2.33 × 10–4,
5.27 × 10–5, and 9.55 × 10–5 (respectively, in S m–1), representative of a
semiconductor. On the other hand, under illumination, the estimated
conductivities became 4.48 × 10–6, 2.33 ×
10–3, 1.66 × 10–4, and 5.93
× 10–4 (in S m–1) for (1–4)-based devices, respectively, showing
a significant enhancement of conductivity in all devices under irradiation
conditions. Besides, the obtained I–V characteristics of the Al/compounds interface under irradiated
and nonirradiated conditions exhibit a nonlinear rectifying nature
representing the distinct characteristic of a Schottky barrier diode
(SBD). Under dark conditions, the rectification ratio (Ion/Ioff) of the SBDs has been
determined as 3.41, 35.26, 7.83, and 26.45, respectively; whereas
under illumination condition, the values were 9.43, 94.14, 41.32,
and 68.21 for (1–4)-based devices,
respectively. The larger current under irradiation condition clearly
represents the photoresponse of the devices, which has been measured
as 2.71, 15.23, 5.76, and 10.11 for (1–4)-based SBDs, respectively.

With the help of thermionic emission
theory, the I–V characteristics
of (1–4)-based SBDs were analyzed.
To extract important diode parameters,
here we have employed Cheung’s method.55 Using eqs 1 and 2, we analyzed I–V curves quantitatively55,56 1   2  where I0, k, T, V, A, η, and A*
stand for saturation current,
electronic charge, Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin, forward
bias voltage, effective diode area, ideality factor, and effective
Richardson constant, respectively. In this work, the effective diode
area has been estimated as 7.065 × 10–2 m2 and the effective Richardson constant has been considered
as 32 A K–2 cm–2 for all devices.

We also determined some important device parameters, like the ideality
factor (η), series resistance (RS), and barrier potential height (ØB) using Cheung’s
equations57,58 (eqs S2–S4). The η values for all devices under dark and illumination
conditions have been computed from the intercept of dV/d(ln I) vs I plot (Figure S2, Table 1). The values of η were found to be 3.48, 2.35,
3.11, and 2.83 under the dark condition for (1–4)-based SBDs, respectively, whereas under illumination condition,
the values became 3.19, 1.44, 2.49, and 2.04 for (1–4)-based SBDs, respectively. A deviation in η from the
ideal value (1) is thus apparent under both conditions. The presence
of inhomogeneities in Schottky barrier height and existence of interface
states and series resistance at the junction may be the major factors
responsible for this deviation.59,60 Here, the notable point
is that the values of η for all SBDs approached a more ideal
value (closer to 1) under irradiation condition, indicating less interfacial
charge recombination and better homogeneity of Schottky junctions.55 Moreover, η values associated with a compound
(2)-based device become more ideal than those associated
with other devices. This observation implies that compound (2) possesses less carrier recombination at the junction, i.e.,
better barrier homogeneity, even under illumination condition than
all other synthesized compound-based devices.

RS values
have been measured from the
slope of dV/d(ln I) vs I plot (Figure S2). Using just
the obtained η values in the eq S4, we have determined ØB from the intercept of H vs I plot (Figure S3) and ØB is found to reduce under irradiation
condition for all compound-based SBDs. The generation of photoinduced
charge carriers and their accumulation near the conduction band may
be the reason of this decrement in ØB. The measured
values of η, ØB, and RS under both dark and illumination conditions for the metal
(Al)–semiconductor (MS) junctions are provided in Table 1. The obtained RS value from the slope of H vs I plot (Figure S3) is also found to decrease upon light illumination (Table 1), indicating the applicability
of the synthesized compounds in optoelectronic devices. In this context,
optical band gap and electrical conductivity data of some recently
reported organic compounds along with our synthesized compounds are
listed in Table S5. Comparing these values,
it can be concluded that our reported 4-aryl-2-pyridone derivatives
have potential for implementation in various optoelectronic devices.

A detail analysis of the I–V curves is required for a better understanding of the charge transport
phenomena at the MS interface. The characteristic I–V curves on the logarithm scale under both
conditions can be divided in two distinct slopes (Figure 8, region I and II).

Figure 8 Typical I–V curves for
the compound (1–4)-based thin-film
devices under (a) dark condition and (b) under illumination condition.

Region–I refers to the
Ohmic regime; here, the slope is
nearly 1 (I ∝ V); in Region–II,
the slope is nearly 2 with I proportional to V2 (Figure 8), representing the characteristic of a trap-free space
charge-limited current (SCLC) regime.55,61 The SCLC theory
was used here to estimate the mobility of materials.55,61

This model was followed to estimate the effective carrier
mobility
from the higher voltage region of the I vs V2 plot (Figure 9), applying the Mott–Gurney equation55,58,61 3  where I refers to the current,
ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the synthesized material,
and μeff is the effective dielectric constant.

Figure 9 I vs V2 curves for the
compound (1–4)-based thin-film devices
(a) under dark condition and (b) under
illumination condition.

The capacitance against frequency plot at a constant bias
potential
(Figure S4) clearly shows a tendency of
saturation of the capacitance in the higher frequency regime. From
this regime, the capacitance was found to be 9.51 × 10–12, 4.76 × 10–11, 1.93 × 10–11, and 2.56 × 10–11 F for (1–4), respectively. The dielectric permittivity of the films
was calculated (eq S5) as 1.52 × 10–1, 7.61 × 10–1, 3.08 ×
10–1, and 4.09 × 10–1 for
(1–4), respectively. To explore charge
transport across the junction, a few more key parameters, like transit
time (τ) and diffusion length (LD), have also been estimated (eqs S6–S8). The LD of charge carriers plays a
significant function in device performance when a metal semiconductor
junction is formed. The estimated values of all parameters in the
SCLC region exhibit an improvement of charge transport properties
after light soaking (Table 2). The higher mobility suggests a greater transport rate and
increase in the number of charge carriers under irradiation condition,
whereas increased LD under light condition
suggests that the charge carriers travel longer before their recombination,
which is responsible for the eventual increase in the current displayed
by the device under light. It is worthy to mention here that the compound
(2)-based SBD shows the best performance compared with
other devices (diode parameters are given in Table 2). Compound (2)-based SBDs also
exhibit much enhanced charge-transfer kinetics after light soaking.
So, this class of compounds can be utilized in device application.

Theoretical Analysis
The band gaps
measured for compounds
(2–4) from the experiment using Tauc’s
plot range from 2.17 to 2.63 eV. Thus, the anion has a small influence
on the band gap value. However, appreciable differences in the electrical
properties of the materials have been found when they are in the dark
or when they are irradiated with light. The theoretical calculations
are carried out to analyze the influence of the counterions upon the
optical characteristics of the compounds. The density functional theory
(DFT) calculations used in this work permit us to study the properties
inherent to each of these materials. However, it should be mentioned
that other effects can also affect the results of the experiments,
like defects, interfaces, impurities, thickness of the semiconductor
layer, excitons, etc., which are obviously not considered in this
DFT study. The experimental crystal coordinates have been used as
the initial geometries for the DFT calculations. Standard band theory
along with partial density of state (PDOS) calculations has been employed
for the analysis of the properties of the optimized structures. The
plot of the Kohn–Sham electronic energy levels as a function
of the reciprocal space vector k has been made using
the first Brillouin zone, where the selected path crosses high-symmetry
points (see Figure 10).

Figure 10 Electronic band structures of compounds (2), (3), and (4). High-symmetry points are labeled
as follows: (2) and (4): G = (0, 0, 0);
F = (0, 0.5, 0); Q = (0, 0.5, 0.5); Z = (0, 0, 0.5); B = (0.5, 0,
0) (3): Z = (0, 0, 0.5); G = (0, 0, 0); Y = (0, 0.5,
0); A = (−0.5, 0.5, 0); B = (−0.5, 0, 0); D = (−0.5,
0, 0.5); E = (−0.5, 0.5, 0.5); C = (0, 0.5, 0.5).

These results confirm that compounds 2–4 are semiconductors (Figure 10). Compound (2) and (4) crystallize
as P1̅ triclinic crystals and compound (3) crystallizes as P21/c monoclinic crystal, and the theoretical band gaps are
1.81, 1.90, and 2.23 eV for compounds (2), (4), and (3), respectively. Previous works have shown
that semiconductor band gap values are underestimated by the DFT method.62,63 However, it is widely accepted that the form of the bands is accurate.
The results from Figure 10 confirm that all compounds are direct-type semiconductors.
Moreover, the experimental trends agree well with the DFT results.
Specifically, compound (2) exhibits the lowest band gap
(2.17 eV), and compound (3), the largest one (2.63 eV).

In Figure 11, we
represent the partial density of states of compounds 2–4. This type of plot allows us to understand
which atoms are responsible for the electrical conductivity since
the transport phenomenon is caused by the e–s located
at the outermost shells. For compounds (2) and (3), the PDOS calculation reveals that 2p orbitals of ketone
and nitrile groups dominate in the uppermost valence bands. In addition,
the 2p orbitals of the aromatic ring dominate in the bottom-most conduction
bands. Neither perchlorate nor chloride has any levels present in
those bands. In contrast, in compound (4), in addition
to 2p orbitals of the CO and CN groups, the 4p orbitals of bromine
anion also participate on top of the valence energy levels. This study
indicates that the role of the anion is more related to structural
changes (crystal packing) that they produce in the 3D architecture
of the compounds than their direct participation in the valence and
conduction bands. This behavior has been previously described in perovskites64,65 and in pyridone-based organic salts.66

The analysis of the optical properties is needed
to rationalize
the electronic structure of the crystal structure. The computation
of the dielectric function ε(ω) and the optical conductivity
σ(ω) is convenient to study how frequently the photon
is absorbed into the material. The real part of the former correlates
with the degree of polarization of the material after the application
of the electric field, and the imaginary part correlates with the
photon absorption. The latter, σ(ω), is useful to analyze
how the illumination affects the conductivity.

The optical properties
have been computed (see Figure 12a) using a photon energy that
ranges from 0 to 16 eV. The peaks represent electronic transitions
from the valence band to the conduction band (uppermost band of the
valence bands to the bottom-most band of the conduction bands). The
dielectric constant has been decomposed in three main directions (εxx, εyy, and
εzz) where the incident light strikes
the product. In compound (2), the optical absorption
begins at 1.72 eV in the three directions (Figure 12, left). It represents the greatest anisotropy
of all three compounds studied theoretically, finding different profiles
depending on the direction of incidence of light on the glass. In
the “y” and “z” directions (εyy and εzz, green and red lines, respectively), it
presents maximum peaks in approximately 2.04, 3.32, 4.02, 5.40, and
8.04 eV into the 1.6–10.5 eV range. On the other hand, the
“x” direction (εxx, blue line) presents maximum peaks at 2.67, 3.28,
5.36, and 8.02 eV. The band structure in compound (3),
which exhibits the highest band gap value of the three compounds,
shows that the peaks in all directions of polarization of light have
similar width but quite different intensity. The first and least intense
maximum peaks in the three directions fall at ∼2.58 eV. Other
maximum peaks can be observed at 3.94, 5.22, and 7.95 eV. Finally,
(4) has one preferred absorption range with maximums
at 2.53, 3.91, 5.36, and 8.45 eV in the directions εxx (blue line) and εzz (red line) of the incident light. Moreover, the behavior
of the optical conductivity (Figure 12b) is similar to that presented by the dielectric constant.
These results demonstrate that only selected wavelengths exhibit an
optical response. In our case, compound (2) begins to
absorb at 1.60 eV with maximums peaks at 2.0, 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 4.0,
5.4, 6.5, and 8.1 eV, therefore being more disposed to the absorption
of light than (3) and (4), which begin to
absorb at 1.8 and 1.77 eV, respectively. These results along with
a lower band gap of 2 explain the larger electrical conductivity
of this crystal and its increment upon illumination.

and real (inset plot) parts of the dielectric

DNA Interaction Results
and Discussions
DNA binding
study was carried out with compound (2) representative
of others. MOE program predicted that the compound partially intercalates
into the DNA base pairs (Table S6, Figure 13) and the free
energy of binding was estimated as −4.70 to −5.30 kcal
mol–1, in agreement with UV–vis spectroscopic
studies. During the binding, numerous hydrogen bonds created between
DNA bases and some specific groups of cationic moiety, like “O”,
“N” of CN, and NH3+ group, give
the system extra stability.

Figure 13 (a) Representative picture for partial intercalation
of the compound
into DNA base pair, and (b) two-dimensional picture for the binding
of cationic 3-pyridinyl-2-pyridone moiety with DNA.

Circular dichroic (CD) spectral study supports
the predicted conformational
free energy, which was found to be ∼0.8 kcal mol–1.

Spectroscopic Result
Figure 14 shows how changes in the concentration
of CT-DNA affect the absorption spectra of the compound (2); the absence of any isosbestic point in the spectra may be due
to the larger molar extinction coefficient of (2) over
that of the compound–DNA complex, formed during binding.66,68

Figure 14 (a) Absorbance spectra of 34 μM compound 2 in
presence of 0, 196, 294, 417, 540, and 620 μM DNA (curves 1–6)
(inset: Benesi–Hildebrand plot) and (b) relative absorbance
change with increasing concentration of DNA.

The binding constant of the compound was determined using
the Benesi–Hildebrand
plot67 (Figure 14, inset) and was found to be 9.21 ×
102 M–1.

CD experiment was carried
out to examine if there appears any conformational
change of DNA during the binding. DNA exhibits a positive band near
270 nm and a negative band near 240 nm, indicating B-form conformation
of DNA. During the binding, changes in both positive and negative
bands were observed (Figure 15). The change in the positive band represents that stacking
between base pairs decreased, whereas the alteration in the conformation
of DNA helix (unwinding) was predicted by change in the negative band.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
synthesized an organic compound and three of
its salts and established the crystal structures of the salts. Detailed
explorations of optical and electrical properties illustrate the semiconducting
nature and photoresponse behavior of the parent organic compound and
its salts. Electrical properties after salt formation are enhanced
significantly as compared to those of the parent compound. Exposure
to visible light improves the electrical conductivity of all compounds,
but this improvement is the maximum in the case of the perchlorate
salt of compound (1). Theoretical studies established
these observations. These organic salts can add a new dimension in
the extensive research field of optoelectronic devices and in organic
semiconducting industries. The DNA binding ability of one of the representative
salts was also checked, and it was observed that the compound can
bind to DNA helix in a partial intercalative manner.
