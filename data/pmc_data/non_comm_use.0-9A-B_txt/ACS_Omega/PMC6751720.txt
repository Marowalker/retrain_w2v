This study was conducted to explore
the in vitro fermentation characteristics
for different ratios of soluble to insoluble dietary fiber in pig
fecal microbiota. The fermentation substrates consisted of inulin
and a non-starch polysaccharide mixture and were divided into five
groups according to different soluble dietary fiber (SDF) to insoluble
dietary fiber (IDF) ratios (SDF 25, 50, 75, and 100%). With the increased
SDF ratio, the total gas production increased, and the pH in the substrate
decreased as the fermentation proceeded. The concentrations of lactic
acid, formic acid, and acetic acid increased in the high SDF ratio
group, whereas the concentrations of propionic acid and butyric acid
increased in the low SDF ratio group. The genera Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group, Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group were enriched
in the high SDF ratio group. Correlation analysis indicated that these
differential bacteria had the potential to degrade polysaccharides.
These results revealed that high SDF ratios could stimulate the proliferation
of fibrolytic bacteria, which in turn degrade fibers to produce organic
acids and monosaccharides. Collectively, these findings add to our
understanding of the mechanisms responsible for interaction between
SDF and intestinal microbiota and provide new ideas for the rational
use of dietary fiber.

==== Body
Introduction
Dietary fiber (DF)
represents the fraction of carbohydrates and
lignin not digested by endogenous digestive enzymes of animals.1 Although DF has a negative impact on energy and
nutrient digestibility, it increasingly attracts interests due to
its fermentable fractions and beneficial effects on gut health.2 According to its solubility, DF is usually divided
into two categories: soluble dietary fiber (SDF) and insoluble dietary
fiber (IDF). The SDF includes pectin, gum, and inulin, which could
slow down the digestion rate, regulate the immune system function,
promote the discharge of toxic heavy metals from the body, lengthen
the time it takes for the stomach to empty, slowing the absorption
of glucose, lower blood cholesterol levels, and reduce the retention
time of excreta in the intestine.3 The
IDF includes cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, which are reported
to be a contributing factor for body fluids and blood circulation
and could reduce the risk of bowel cancer, increase the volume of
feces, smooth bowel movements, prevent constipation, and lessen the
toxins from bacteria in the digestive tract.4 These beneficial functions are partially mediated by the SCFAs,
which serve as the major energy source for intestinal epithelial cells
and could promote intestinal mucosal growth and improve intestinal
health.5 There are great variations in
the compositions and contents of DF in the feedstuffs, which determine
their physicochemical properties in the intestinal tract of pigs and
in turn affect the fermentation characteristics of the intestinal
microbiota.6 Therefore, the selective addition
of DF to the feedstuff can be used as a nutritional strategy to optimize
the intestinal health in pigs.

Bacteria account for the majority
in the gut microbiota of pigs.
The number of microorganisms per gram of large intestine content in
pigs is about 1010–1011, including more than 50 genera and 500 species of bacteria.7 The structure and composition of the diet as
well as the solubility, amount, and type of available substrates have
important influences on the quantity and viability of the gut microbes.8 Dietary fiber can affect the digestive site and
the intestinal microenvironment, thereby affecting the microbial proliferation
in the gut. In addition, changes in the chemical structure of DF could
affect their utilization by gut microbiota.8 In recent years, studies on various animal models have shown that
different types of DFs have different effects on the digestion of
nutrients in different parts of the intestine and on the fermentation
process and intestinal microbiota.9−11 At present, the influence
of DF on intestinal health of humans and animals and its interaction
with intestinal microbiota are receiving increasing attention.1,6,12

Previous studies have shown
that feeding different DFs has an inconsistent
effect on intestinal health and productive phenotypes in pigs.13,14 There is evidence that pigs that consumed corn bran and wheat bran
have better weight gain and feed efficiency than those fed soybean
hulls. We speculated that the reason for this phenomenon may be the
difference in the ratio of SDF to IDF in diets. Therefore, the objective
of this study was to explore the fermentation characteristics of SDF/IDF
with different ratios and their interaction with intestinal microbiota.
Due to the single research variable, the controllable process, and
the ability to monitor the fermentation dynamics in real time, numerous
studies have adopted the in vitro fermentation to investigate the
interaction between nutrients and gut microbiota in recent years.15,16 In the current study, the method of in vitro fermentation was also
used to explore the dynamic changes of intestinal microbiota and DFs
at different fermentation time points, using the microbiota in fresh
feces of growing pigs as inocula and different SDF/IDF ratios as fermentation
substrates.

Results
Gas Production and Changes in pH
In this experiment,
we monitored the total gas production and real-time pH at eight time
points including the start and endpoint of the fermentation. Gas production
data at different time points are reported in Table 1. The different proportions of SDF produced
similar amounts of gas when compared to each other at 4 h (P > 0.05). From 4 to 48 h, different ratios of SDF caused
significant differences in gas production, which increased with the
increased SDF ratio (P < 0.05). Similar to the
trend of gas production, the pH decreased as the fermentation proceeded
(P < 0.05; Table 2). For all five groups, the pH showed a slow decrease
during the first 16 h of fermentation (P < 0.05).
However, the rate of pH change increased as the SDF ratio increased
within 16–48 h of fermentation (P < 0.05).
Besides, there were significant differences in the pH of the five
groups at all time points of fermentation (P <
0.05).

Changes of Microbial Metabolites
Lactic acid and SCFA
production data at different time points are reported in Table 3. In general, the
SCFAs concentration increased with the increase in the proportion
of SDF (P < 0.05). The concentration of formic
acid and acetic acid among the five groups was significantly different
at all time points (P < 0.05). The concentration
of propionic acid was markedly different at 16 h (P < 0.05), whereas the concentration of butyric acid did not change
significantly at 16 h of fermentation (P > 0.05).
In addition, there were certain concentrations of propionic acid and
butyric acid in the SDF 0% group, but these two acids were not detected
in the other four groups at 32 and 48 h. Moreover, our results showed
that the lactic acid contents between the five groups were significantly
different at all time points (P < 0.05), and the
differences among these groups increased as the proportion of SDF
increased.

Summary of 16S rRNA Gene Profiles and Diversity
We
totally collected 2,222,884 high-quality sequences of the V3–V4
region in 45 fermentation broth samples after quality control. The
average numbers of high-quality sequence generated per sample were
49,397 from microbial populations. A total of 651, 536, and 436 core
OTUs in microbial communities were identified at 16, 32, and 48 h,
respectively. At 16 h, only 15 OTUs were found in the SDF 0% group,
whereas 10, 3, 12, and 6 OTUs were specifically identified in the
SDF 25%, SDF 50%, SDF 75%, and SDF 100% groups, respectively (Figure 1A). At 32 h, 16 OTUs
were only found in the SDF 0% group, whereas 17, 14, 9, and 8 OTUs
were specifically identified in the SDF 25%, SDF 50%, SDF 75%, and
SDF 100% groups, respectively (Figure 1B). At 48 h, 30 OTUs were only found in the SDF 0%
group, whereas 21, 13, 7, and 7 OTUs were specifically identified
in the SDF 25%, SDF 50%, SDF 75%, and SDF 100% groups, respectively
(Figure 1C).

The difference in microbial α-diversity of fermentation broths
from the five groups is shown in Figure 2. At 16 h, the Shannon, ACE, and Chao indexes
did not change among the five groups (P > 0.05; Figure 2A–C). At 32
and 48 h, the Shannon, ACE, and Chao indexes decreased as the SDF
ratio increased (P < 0.05; Figure 2D–I). Microbial β-diversity
had little shift at 16 h (Figure 3A). However, PCoA based on the Bray–Curtis distances
showed a shift in the microbial β-diversity of fermentation
broths at 32 and 48 h (Figure 3B,C).

Differential Analysis of Bacterial Communities
Significant
differences in the relative abundance of genera in fermentation broths
among the five groups at a certain time point were further identified
using the multiple comparison analysis (Figure 4). We performed a differential analysis of
the top 10 bacteria among the five groups at the genus level. At 16
h, the differential bacteria were Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group (P < 0.05; Figure 4A). At 32 h, the differential bacteria were Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group, Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group (P < 0.05; Figure 4B). At 48 h, the differential bacteria were Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group and Christensenellaceae_R-7_group (P < 0.05; Figure 4C).

We further performed LEfSe analysis to identify bacteria that differed
significantly among different SDF ratio groups in this study. At 16
h, the genera Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group were significantly enriched
in the SDF 100 and 0% groups, respectively (Figure 5A). At 32 h, the genera Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group, and Christensenellaceae_R-7_group were significantly enriched in the SDF 100, 25, and 75% group, respectively
(Figure 5B). At 48
h, Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group and Christensenellaceae_R-7_group were significantly enriched in the SDF 25 and 75% groups, respectively
(Figure 5C).

Monosaccharide Production
and Correlation Analysis
We tested the concentrations of
isodulcite, arabinose, galactose,
glucose, mannose, and fructose at 16, 32, and 48 h in five different
SDF ratio groups (Table 4). The isodulcite concentration in the five groups dramatically changed
at 16 h of fermentation (P < 0.05); however, there
was no significant alteration at 32 and 48 h (P >
0.05). The arabinose and fructose concentrations in the five groups
dramatically changed at 16 and 32 h of fermentation (P < 0.05); however, there was no significant alteration at 48 h
(P > 0.05). The galactose concentration in the
five
groups did not change significantly at 16, 32, and 48 h of fermentation
(P > 0.05). The glucose and mannose concentration
in the five groups did not change significantly at 16 h of fermentation
(P > 0.05); however, they dramatically changed
at
32 and 48 h of fermentation (P < 0.05).

A Spearman’s correlation matrix was generated
to explore
the correlation between the top 10 bacterial genera (Figure 4) and monosaccharides (Table 4). As shown in Figure 6, significant associations
were identified between the microbiota and the monosaccharides at
16, 32, and 48 h of fermentation. At 16 h (Figure 6A), the correlation analysis revealed that
the fructose level was negatively correlated with the genera Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005,
Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-002, and Coprostanoligenes_group. The arabinose and
glucose levels were negatively correlated with the genera Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group and Coprostanoligenes_group. At 32 h (Figure 6B), the correlation analysis revealed that the galactose level was
negatively correlated with the genera Christensenellaceae_R-7_group and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-002. The isodulcite level
was negatively correlated with the genera Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005 and Coprostanoligenes_group. The mannose and glucose
levels were positively correlated with the genus Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 and negatively correlated with the genera Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005, and Christensenellaceae_R-7_group. The arabinose level was positively correlated with the genus Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, whereas it was negatively correlated
with the genera Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group and Christensenellaceae_R-7_group. At 48 h (Figure 6C), the correlation analysis revealed that the isodulcite level was
negatively correlated with the genus Christensenellaceae_R-7_group. The arabinose level was positively correlated with the genus Bacteroides. The fructose level was negatively correlated
with the genera Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-002. The glucose and mannose levels

Discussion
In recent years, many studies have shown that
DF has an excellent
effect on the intestinal health and production performance of pigs.9,10 Therefore, there is growing interest in its fermentable fraction
in dietary composition. In this study, we used the fresh feces of
pigs as inocula and different ratios of SDF and IDF in substrates
to simulate an in vivo intestinal microenvironment using in vitro
fermentation of intestinal microbiota. The aim was to investigate
the interactions between different proportions of SDF and the intestinal
microbiome. Our results revealed that with the increase of SDF ratios
and the prolongation of fermentation time, the total gas production
of the fermentation broths gradually increased, and the pH value gradually
decreased and reached the plateau at 48 h of fermentation. Besides,
the SCFAs concentration and the generation of monosaccharides varied
with the SDF ratios and the fermentation time. Importantly, the gut
microbiome in different fermentation times also underwent dramatic
changes with different proportions of SDF groups. We also observed
that certain specific microbes were closely related to the monosaccharide
production and fiber utilization.

The generation of gas and
the change of pH are two classic indicators
reflecting the degree of fermentation.17 Previous studies have shown that different types of fiber-rich foods
have significantly different fermentation kinetics in the gut of pigs.
In addition, the fermentation of DF by pig intestinal microbes depends
mainly on the specific composition of the DF, such as the content
and proportion of SDF and IDF.18 In the
current study, the gas production of all groups increased gradually
during the first 16 h. The gas production in 16–32 h showed
a jump increase, and the increase in gas production gentled within
32–48 h. In addition, the difference in pH is mainly related
to the ratio of SDF, and the difference in pH among the five groups
became larger as the fermentation time increased. Consistently, previous
studies have shown that different components of DF have different
fermentability in the intestine. The SDF could be rapidly fermented,
and a higher ratio of IDF could reduce the degradability of DF.19,20

Dietary fiber could be metabolized by bacteria to produce
lactic
acid and SCFAs, and the rate of hydrolysis of dietary fiber determines
the production of lactic acid and SCFAs.21 In this study, we tested the concentrations of lactic acid, formic
acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid in substrates
with different ratios of SDF at 16, 32, and 48 h of the in vitro fermentation.
In general, the SCFA concentration increased with the increase in
the proportion of SDF. Previous studies have found that d-tagatose could be fermented to produce formic acid in the large
intestine of pigs.22 Our data revealed
that the concentration of formic acid among the five groups was significantly
different at all time points, and the differences among these groups
increased as the proportion of SDF increased. This result indicated
that certain components of SDF could be metabolized to produce formic
acid by microorganisms. Acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid
are the major SCFAs in the human hindgut, which account for 90–95%
of the total SCFAs.23 Our results showed
that the concentration of acetic acid increased significantly in the
high proportion of SDF groups (≥25%). This may be because soluble
substrates are more susceptible to microbial degradation.24 As the major source of energy, propionic acid
and butyric acid can be utilized by the intestinal epithelial cells.25 In the current study, there were certain concentrations
of propionic acid and butyric acid in the 0% SDF group, but these
two acids were not detected in the other four groups at the late fermentation
stage. Besides, our results showed that the concentration of lactic
acid was significantly higher in the high SDF proportion group than
that in the low SDF proportion group. Previous study has shown that
the concentration of acetic acid in the cecum of pigs fed inulin was
significantly lower than that of the control group and the concentration
of propionic acid was significantly increased.26 It is suggested that inulin has the potential to change
the proportion of short-chain fatty acids in the hindgut. In the present
study, the concentrations of propionic acid and butyric acid in the
fermentation broths were not detected after 32 h of fermentation.
There is evidence that some components of short-chain fatty acids
were significantly lower than fermentation for 12 h after 24 h of
in vitro fermentation of inulin.27 Therefore,
we speculate that some of the short-chain fatty acid components in
the fermentation system could be consumed by microorganisms, but further
exploration is needed in the future studies. Studies have shown that
inulin could be used as a functional food to promote intestinal health.28 However, there was evidence that inulin has
the potential to induce cholestatic liver cancer.29 Therefore, the effects of fermentation of high proportion
of SDF on animal health need to be studied further.

There is
evidence that DFs with different structures have different
effects on the structure and composition of the pig intestinal microbiota.6 Our results indicated that the number of OTUs
shared by different SDF ratios decreased with the extension of fermentation
time. Besides, the change of the α-diversity indicated that
the microorganisms were proliferating in the early stage of fermentation,
and the decrease of microbial richness and diversity was caused by
the proceeding of fermentation and the increase of SDF ratio. In our
study, the relative abundance of bacteria at the phylum level among
all samples was evaluated. At 16, 32, and 48 h, OTUs were assigned
to four phyla (relative abundance >99%), including
Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetae, and Proteobacteria (Figure S1A–C). Similarly, the four dominant
taxonomic phyla were also found in other studies on the interaction
between pig gut microbiota and dietary fiber.21 Firmicutes is thought to be beneficial bacteria to metabolize plant
polysaccharides to SCFAs.30 In the present
study, the relative abundance of Firmicutes was the most predominant
in all groups, which was consistent with the previous study.6 Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were also the
dominant flora in our study, which play a major role in organic matter
degradation and C cycling.31 Besides, Spirochaetae
was also found in pig feces samples.32 At
the genus level, we revealed predominant genera in Figure S1D–F (relative abundance of >99%). A previous study has shown that Clostridium could ferment polysaccharides to SCFAs.33 In our study, the relative abundance of Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 was significantly increased in the relatively high proportion of
SDF groups (≥ 25%) at 16 and 32 h. Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group has an impact on carbohydrate,32 and
its relative abundance has changed significantly in the five groups
at 16 and 32 h. Ruminococcaceae belongs to the Firmicutes
phylum, which was considered as fibrolytic bacteria to ferment the
complex component of the plant cell wall.13 In addition, Christensenellaceae was regarded as
potential beneficial bacteria because it participated in the positive
regulation of the intestinal environment and linked to immunomodulation
and healthy homeostasis.34 We also observed
that the Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group and Christensenellaceae_R-7_group markedly changed in the five
groups at 32 and 48 h. These results indicated that the effects of
different SDF ratios on the gut microbiome are mainly involved in
fiber degradation, SCFAs production, and maintenance of the intestinal
health. In addition, LEfSe analysis suggested that a relatively high
proportion of SDF (≥25%) may be more conducive to improving
the ability of intestinal microbes to degrade fibers. Recent studies
have shown that gut microbiota regulated the metabolism of monosaccharides
such as fructose, mannose, and galactose.35 Similarly, our data indicated that some of the differential bacteria
enriched in the high SDF ratio group were closely related to the changes
of certain monosaccharides. In addition, other non-differential bacteria
also have a significant correlation with monosaccharides, suggesting
that they may have the potential to degrade polysaccharides. However,
due to the large differences in molecular weight, structure, and conformation
of different monosaccharides, the mechanism by which microorganisms
produced and utilized them was still unclear. Therefore, the relationship
between the structure of monosaccharide and specific microbial function
needs to be further studied.

In summary, the fermentation characteristics
of different DFs were
mainly affected by the SDF ratio and fermentation time. Although microbial
diversity was reduced, a high proportion of SDF (≥ 25%) was
beneficial to the proliferation of fibrolytic bacteria. Besides, the
dominant bacteria in the group with high proportion of SDF were closely
related to polysaccharide degradation and monosaccharide production,
but the underlying mechanism still needs to be further explored. Our
findings may help to better understand the fermentation characteristics
of different proportions of SDF and the interaction between SDF and
intestinal microbiota and may provide new ideas for the rational formulation
of nutrition intervention strategies.

Materials and Methods
Preparation
of Inocula and Substrates
The pigs (Landrace
×Large White) originated from an antibiotic-free herd were housed
in a temperature-controlled room with no exposure to antibiotics during
the whole process of this study. All pigs consumed a standard corn-soybean
meal basal diet formulated to meet their growth requirements for 2
weeks prior to fecal collection. Three healthy pigs (approximately
30 kg) were selected and served as sources of feces from which the
inoculum was prepared. Feces (approximately 100–200 g) were
manually collected directly from the rectum of pigs within 1 h after
feeding, immediately stored in a plastic container, which was pre-flushed
with CO2 and placed in an ice box, and transferred to the
laboratory within 1 h after collection. The substrates were formulated
with SDF (inulin, Hebei Vilof Agricultural Technology Co., China)
and IDF (commodity fiber,36 a mixture of
various non-starch polysaccharides, the main ingredients are glucan,
galactan, bhamnosan, araban, xylan and mannan) and were divided into
five groups according to the different SDF to IDF ratios: 1:0 (SDF
100% group), 3:1 (SDF 75% group), 1:1 (SDF 50% group), 1:3 (SDF 25%
group), and 0:1 (SDF 0% group).

In Vitro Fermentation Trial
The medium for the in vitro
fermentation trial was prepared according to the previous study.37 The ratio of the inocula, substrates, and medium
was prepared as described by the previous report.38 The fermentation system includes 3 g of substrate, 492
mL of medium, and 30 mL of inoculum. Sterile nitrogen was continuously
supplied during the fermentation period, the temperature was maintained
at 39 ± 0.5 °C, and the stirring shaft speed was 80 rpm.
The fermentation broth was sampled after 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48
h. Fermentation residues were sampled at 48 h. Changes of pH were
monitored throughout the fermentation process.

Cumulative Gas Profiles
Following the same experimental
design, glass bottles (volume capacity of 120 mL) containing substrates
(0.5 mg), medium (82 mL), and inoculum (5 mL) were anaerobically incubated
at 39 °C for 48 h. Throughout the whole incubation,
all the bottles were sealed with Hungate’s stoppers and screw
caps and connected to gas channel inlets of an automated trace gas
recording system (AGRS-III, China Agricultural University, Beijing,
China) through medical transfusion tubes and needles to continuously
record cumulative gas production.39

Analysis
of SCFAs
SCFA concentrations in the fermentation
broths were analyzed using the method described in a previous report.40 In brief, the fermentation broth was diluted
with ultrapure water, and then the diluent was filtered using a 0.20
mm nylon membrane filter (Millipore, Bedford, OH) and poured into
a gas chromatograph system (GC-14B; Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan; capillary
column: 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 mm film thickness; column
temperature of 110 °C; injector temperature of 180 °C; and
detector temperature of 180 °C). The analyses were conducted
with a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector
and a peak profile integration quantification integrator (Shimadzu
Corp., Columbia, MD). Each sample peak profile was integrated and
quantified relative to an internal standard of methyl butyric acid
placed in the same sample. Analyses were conducted at an oven temperature
of 200 °C and a flow rate of 85 mL/min.

Analysis of Monosaccharides
The monosaccharides in
fermentation broths were determined as alditol acetates by gas–liquid
chromatography (GLC) for neutral sugars and uronic acids by a colorimetric
method using a modification of the Uppsala method according to a previous
study.41 The GLC analysis of the monosaccharides
was performed on an Agilent GC 6890 with a flow rate of 20 mL/min
and split 40:1. A 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 mm column (Agilent
DB-225, film thickness 0.25 μm) was used. The column temperature
was 220 °C, and the injector and detector temperature was 250
°C. Determination of fructose content in fermentation broths
was performed using a commercial kit (Product number: ml077215; Shanghai
Enzyme-linked Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China), according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.

DNA Extraction, 16S rRNA
Gene Amplification, and Analysis of
Sequencing Data
Total microbial genomic DNA in the fermentation
broths was extracted using the QIAamp Fast DNAStool Mini Kit (Qiagen
Ltd., Germany) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
The V3–V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified with universal
primers 341F (ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG) and 806R (GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT),
as described by previous study.42 The amplified
products were detected using agarose gel electrophoresis (2% agarose),
recovered using the AxyPrepDNA gel recovery kit (Axygen Biosciences,
Union City, CA,United States), and then quantified using a Qubit 2.0
Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States)
to pool into equimolar amounts. Amplicon libraries were sequenced
on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United
States) for paired-end reads of 250 base pairs.

In order to
obtain more accurate and reliable results in subsequent bioinformatics
analysis, the raw data from Illumina Hiseq high-throughput sequencing
were pre-processed to eliminate the adapter pollution and low quality
for obtaining clean reads.43 The paired-end
clean reads with overlap were merged to tags using Connecting Overlapped
Pair-End (COPE, V1.2.1) software. Subsequently, bacterial tags were
clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% sequence
similarity by scripts of USEARCH (v7.0.1090) software. Bacterial OTU
representative sequences were taxonomically classified by scripts
of Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Classifier v.2.2 software based
on the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) database. The data was analyzed
on the free online platform of Majorbio I-Sanger Cloud Platform (www.i-sanger.com).

Statistical
Analysis
The statistical analyses were
carried out with tests using the SPSS software package (SPSS v. 20.0,
SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Differences between means were determined
using Tukey’s honest significance test. Statistical variation
was also estimated by the standard error of the mean. All statistical
analyses were considered significant at P < 0.05.
