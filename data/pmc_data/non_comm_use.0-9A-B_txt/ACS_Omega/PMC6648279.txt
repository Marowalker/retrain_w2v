The
mechanism of the asymmetric addition of aldehyde (butanal)
to nitroolefin (β-nitrostyrene) catalyzed by H-d-Pro-Pro-Glu-NH2 (dPPE-NH2; 1) was explored using
density functional theory methods in chloroform. By conformational
search, it was confirmed that catalyst 1 and its enamine
intermediate adopted a dominant conformation with a βI structure
stabilized by a C10 H-bond between the C=O of d-Pro1 and C-terminal NH2 proton and by an additional
H-bond between the side chain and the backbone of Glu3. This βI
turn structure was conserved all along the catalytic cycle. Consistently
with the kinetic studies, the C–C bond formation between the
enamine and electrophile was also confirmed as the rate-determining
step. The stereoselectivity results from a re → re prochiral approach of enamine and β-nitrostyrene
with a gauche– orientation of the double bonds.
Although it was suggested as the possible formation of dihydrooxazine
oxide species, this process was confirmed to be kinetically less accessible
than the formation of acyclic nitronate. In particular, our calculated
results supported that the carboxylic acid group of Glu3 in 1 played a central role by acting as general acid/base all
along the catalytic cycle and orienting the asymmetric C–C
bond formation.

Introduction
The advent of organocatalysis
has brought the prospect of a mode
of catalysis, complementary to organometallic systems, with the potential
for savings in cost, time, and energy; easier experimental procedures;
and reductions in chemical waste.1 Among
environmentally friendly organocatalysts, peptides and peptide-based
molecules have emerged as promising candidates (for reviews, see ref (2)). Both combinatorial and
de novo methods of the catalyst design have been demonstrated successfully
to perform a variety of asymmetric conjugate addition reactions including
aldol, Mannich, Michael, and Morita–Baylis–Hillman reactions.2a,2e,3 From a synthetic perspective,
after the recognition of proline’s aptitude in formation of
carbon–carbon bond in a stereoselective fashion,4 remarkable efforts have been endorsed in the
development of chiral-amine and peptide-based organocatalysts bearing
a pyrrolidine moiety.5 It is widely accepted
that in such transformations an enamine intermediate is generated
by condensing a carbonyl bearing reagent with the catalytic pyrrolidine.
Reaction of the enamine then proceeds via addition on an electrophile
partner, and the resulting iminium ion is finally hydrolyzed to afford
the products. Another less explored possible mechanism involves enol
as activated species for addition to the electrophile.6

In such a field, the organocatalytic Michael addition
reaction
of ketones or aldehydes to nitroolefins has recently attracted considerable
attention because of the importance of resultant chiral nitroalkanes
as synthetically valuable building blocks.7 Considering activity and selectivity, Wennemers tripeptide H-d-Pro-Pro-Glu-NH2 (dPPE-NH2; peptide 1 in Scheme 1) deserves special mention as a highly active and stereoselective
catalyst for Michael conjugate addition of aldehydes to nitroethylene8 and β-monosubstituted nitro-olefins in
the protic CHCl3/iPrOH (9:1 v/v) environment9 (Scheme 1). It has noteworthy achieved the highest levels of stereocontrol
under the lowest catalyst loading reported to date without significant
catalyst deactivation. ESI–MS back-reaction screening experiments
support an enamine mechanism because enamine and iminium have been
detected as intermediates.10 Considering
such a pathway, the catalytic cycle should be divided into four main
steps consisting of (i) enamine formation, (ii) reaction with the
nitroolefin to yield a new C–C bond, (iii) protonation of the
nitronate intermediate, and finally (iv) hydrolysis of the iminium.
Kinetic studies provided insights that the reaction of the enamine
with the electrophile is rate limiting and highlight a double role
of the acidic group. It first orients the reactivity and stereoselectivity
and secondly, it improves the reaction rate by promoting protonation
of the iminium nitronate.11,12 Although the acid group
probably coordinates the nitronate function, its exact role as well
as the protonation states along the catalytic pathway are not fully
understood. Especially, its presence is not indispensable because
a powerful catalytic tripeptide without the acid group has been reported
for the addition of nitro-Michael between aldehydes and β,β-disubstituted
nitro-olefins.13

Cycle: (i) Enamine Formation, (ii) C–C Bond Formation, (iii)
Protonation of the Nitronate and (iv) Hydrolysis10
Alternative mechanisms
have been proposed for the catalysts which
do not have acidic hydrogen. As an example, with chiral prolinol ether
derivatives, cyclic intermediates such as dihydrooxazine and cyclobutane
(1-D′ and 1-C′ in Chart 1a, respectively) were
identified as resting states of catalysts,14−16 and the rate-determining
step (rds) of the reaction was suggested to be the protonation of
the dihydrooxazine oxide species16 instead
of the iminium (refs (14a,15a)) or enamine
nitronates (ref (15b)). An analogous cyclobutane intermediate has also been found in the
reaction of butanal and nitrostyrene with dPPE-NH2 methyl
ester.11 Hence, even they are not populated
to a significant extent, dihydrooxazine and cyclobutane intermediates
could not be excluded in dPPE-NH2 as a catalyst.

Catalyzed by Diaryl Prolinol Ethers; (b) the Enamine Intermediate

Recently, Rigling et al. investigated the conformational
preferences
of dPPE-NH2 (1) and its enamine intermediate
(1-En′ in Chart 1b) obtained by reaction with phenylacetaldehyde in
a solution of CDCl3/CD3OH (9:1) using NMR spectroscopy
and density functional theory (DFT) methods.17 In dPPE-NH2, a strong nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE)
was found between the amide NH of Glu3 and one of the C-terminal amide
protons, which supports the formation of a β-turn conformation
with a H-bond between the carbonyl group of d-Pro1 and the
amide proton of the C-terminal group. By the lower vicinal coupling
constants (close to 4 Hz) from the Hβ protons to Hα and
Hγ1, it was suggested as distinct conformational
preferences of the side chain torsion angles χ1 and
χ2 of Glu3 at ∼60° (g+) and
−60° (g–), respectively, which indicates
a conformation with the side chain of Glu3 pointing toward d-Pro1. However, it was found that 1-En′ with
the s-trans configuration still adopts a β-turn conformation
being less populated compared to dPPE-NH2 by observing
a stronger NOE between Hα of d-Pro1 and NH of Glu3
and by a significantly higher temperature dependence of the C-terminal
CONH1 amide proton chemical shift in 1-En′
than in peptide 1. The higher flexibility of the Glu3
side chain and backbone in 1-En′ was suggested
to be essential to stereoselectively accommodate the incoming nitroolefin
for the C–C bond formation. However, the detailed pathways
for the formation of iminium-nitronate, protonation, and hydrolysis
were not reported.

The Michael addition of propanal to β-nitrostyrene
catalyzed
by diarylprolinol silyl ether has been the subject of computational
studies using DFT methods to investigate the stereoselctivity of the
C–C bond formation and mechanistic pathways.16,18 In earlier studies, the lowest-energy transition state was obtained
for the (R,S) pathway (∼23
kcal mol–1) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory.18 In a recent study, the free energy of the transition
state for the (R,S) pathway was
computed as 16.2 kcal mol–1 in chloroform by the
sum of the free energy at the ωB97X-D/6-311++G(3df,3pd)//ωB97X-D/6-311G(d,p)
level of theory and polarizable continuum model (PCM) solvation free
energy at the ωB97X-D/6-311G(d,p) level of theory.16b In particular, the stereoselectivity was suggested
to be primarily controlled by the C–C bond formation even though
the reaction rate was dictated by the subsequent protonation step.16b

Here, we explored the plausible pathways
of addition of aldehyde
(butanal) to nitroolefin (β-nitrostyrene) catalyzed by dPPE-NH2 in chloroform by DFT calculations. Our results highlight
the central role of the carboxylic acid group by acting as a general
acid/base all along the catalytic cycle and orienting the asymmetric
C–C bond formation.

Results and Discussion
Preferred Conformations
of dPPE-NH2
For
dPPE-NH2 (1), we identified 11 local minima
with ΔE < 10 kcal mol–1 at the M06-2X/6-31G(d) level of theory in the gas phase. However,
there were only four local minima with the relative Gibbs free energy
(ΔG) < 10 kcal mol–1 at
the ωB97X-D/6-311++G(d,p)//SMD M06-2X/6-31+G(d) level of theory
in chloroform. The torsion angles and thermodynamic properties of
these local minima in chloroform are listed in Table 1.

The most preferred conformation
1-dPPE-NH2 was dominantly
populated in chloroform (ΔG = 0.0 kcal mol–1 with a population of 100%) and the next preferred
conformers were 2-dPPE-NH2, 3-dPPE-NH2, and
4-dPPE-NH2 with ΔG = 4.1, 5.6, and
6.3 kcal mol–1, respectively (Table 1 and Figure 1). The most preferred conformer 1-dPPE-NH2 adopted a type I β-turn (βI) structure, which appeared
to be stabilized by a C10 H-bond between the C=O
of d-Pro1 and the proton of the C-terminal amide NH2 with a distance of d(C=Od-Pro1···H–NC-terminal) = 2.01
Å (Figure 1a).
In addition, there were two additional H-bonds between the side chain
Cδ=Oε1 and backbone NH proton
of Glu3 with a distance of d(Cδ=OGlu3ε1···H–NGlu3) = 1.92 Å and between the side chain carboxylic proton
of Glu3 and the amide nitrogen of d-Pro1 with a distance
of d(Oε2–HGlu3···Nd-Pro1) = 1.59 Å
(Figure 1a). Although
the second preferred conformer 2-dPPE-NH2 had two H-bonds
between the C=O of d-Pro1 and the NH proton of Glu3
with a distance of d(C=Od-Pro1···H–NGlu3) = 2.03 Å and between
the side chain carboxylic proton of Glu3 and the amide nitrogen of d-Pro1 with a distance of d(Oε2–HGlu3···Nd-Pro1) = 1.66 Å (Figure 1b), 2-dPPE-NH2 was energetically and enthalpically
less favored than 1-dPPE-NH2 (Table 1). Although 3-dPPE-NH2 and 4-dPPE-NH2 had two H-bonds as found in 2-dPPE-NH2 and an
additional H-bond of the C-terminal NH2 proton with the
C=O of Pro2 and the side chain carboxylic Cδ=Oε1 of Glu3, respectively (Figure 1c,d), they are 1.6 and 2.1
kcal mol–1 higher in ΔE than
2-dPPE-NH2 (Table 1).

The backbone torsion angles of
the most preferred conformation
1-dPPE-NH2 in chloroform were calculated as (ψ1, ψ2, ϕ3, ψ3) = (−158°, −16°, −63°, −21°)
(Table 1), which are
consistent with the mean values of (−152 ± 1°, −36
± 10°, −66 ± 11°, 2 ± 15°) obtained
by simulated annealing calculations with the restraints of NOEs, residual
dipolar couplings, and vicinal coupling constants from NMR experiments.17 In addition, our calculated torsion angles (χ31, χ32) = (76°,
−65°) of the side chain of Glu3 (Table 1) are in accord with the conformational preference
of the side chain torsion angles χ1 and χ2 of Glu3 at g+ and g–, respectively,
deduced from vicinal coupling constants between protons at Cα,
Cβ, and Cγ in Glu3.17

Preferred
Conformations of the Enamine 1-En
For the enamine
intermediate 1-En, we identified 40
local minima with ΔE < 10 kcal mol–1 at the M06-2X/6-31G(d) level of theory in the gas phase and 30 local
minima with ΔG < 5 kcal mol–1 at the ωB97X-D/6-311++G(d,p)//SMD M06-2X/6-31+G(d) level of
theory in chloroform. The torsion angles and thermodynamic properties
of 12 local minima of 1-En with ΔG < 3 kcal mol–1 in chloroform are listed in Table 2. All 30 local minima
with ΔG < 5 kcal mol–1 in chloroform are listed in Table S1 of the Supporting Information.

The conformer En-01 of 1-En (Figure 2a) was
the most preferred, as indicated by
the ΔG values with a population of 45%; the
next most preferred conformers were En-02, En-03, and En-04 (Figure 2b–d) [ΔG = 0.6, 0.6, and 1.0 kcal mol–1, respectively
(Table 2); populated
at 17, 16, and 9%, respectively], confirming the higher flexibility
of 1-En compared with dPPE-NH2. The most preferred
conformer En-01 adopted a βI structure stabilized by a C10 H-bond between the C=O of d-Pro1 and the
proton of the C-terminal amide NH2 with a distance of d(C=Od-Pro1···H–NC-terminal) = 2.02 Å (Figure 2a). In addition, there was an additional
H-bond between the side chain Cδ=Oε1 and the backbone NH proton of Glu3 with a distance of d(Cδ=OGlu3ε1···H–NGlu3) = 1.92 Å (Figure 2a). Although a H-bond between the side chain carboxylic proton
of Glu3 and the amide nitrogen of d-Pro1 was lost in En-01
because of the enamine formation, the overall conformation of En-01
with the torsion angles (ψ1, ψ2,
ϕ3, ψ3, χ31, χ32, χ33) = (−167°, −19°, −78°,
−14°, 85°, −66°, 175°) (Table 2) was quite similar
to the most preferred conformer 1-dPPE-NH2 of peptide 1 (Table 1).

The second most preferred conformer
En-02 had two H-bonds between
the C=O of Pro2 and the proton of the C-terminal amide NH2 with a distance of d(C=OPro2···H–NC-terminal) = 2.07
Å and between the side chain Cδ=Oε1 and the amide NH of Glu3 with a distance of d(Oε1···H–NGlu3) = 2.24 Å (Figure 2b). Conformer En-02 was 2.7 kcal mol–1 less
favored in ΔH relative to the most preferred
En-01, but the former had more conformational flexibility of −TΔS = −2.1 kcal mol–1 than the latter. The third most preferred conformer En-03 had only
one H-bond between the C=O of d-Pro1 and the proton
of the C-terminal amide NH2 with a distance of d(C=Od-Pro1···H–NC-terminal) = 1.99 Å (Figure 2c). Conformer En-03 was 1.6 kcal mol–1 less favored in ΔH relative
to the most preferred En-01, but the former had more conformational
flexibility of −TΔS = −1.0 kcal mol–1 than the latter. The
fourth most preferred conformer En-04 had two H-bonds between the
C=O of Pro2 and the proton of the C-terminal amide NH2 with a distance of d(C=OPro2···H–NC-terminal) = 2.17 Å and between the C=O
of d-Pro1 and the side chain carboxylic proton of Glu3 and
the C=O of d-Pro1 with a distance of d(Oε2–HGlu3···C=Od-Pro1) = 1.73 Å (Figure 2d). Conformer En-04 was 2.8 kcal mol–1 less favored in ΔH relative
to the most preferred En-01, but the former had more conformational
flexibility of −TΔS = −1.8 kcal mol–1 than the latter. The
other conformers En-05 to En-12 exhibited values of ΔG = 1.2–2.8 kcal mol–1 and populations
less than 6% in chloroform (Table 2).

Our results are in agreement with the NMR
data reported by Rigling
et al. for the enamine intermediate named 1-En′
obtained by condensation of dPPE-NH2 (1) with
phenylacetaldehyde.17 Despite a predominant
β-turn conformation, the enamine intermediates appeared more
flexible than the parent catalyst dPPE-NH2. We also predicted
that the puckerings of d-Pro1 and Pro2 in En-01 are both
Cγ-endo, which are consistent with NMR data for 1-En′.17 The main difference between
En-01 and 1-En′ relates to the conformation of
the Glu3 side chain. While (χ31, χ32) = (−71°, 78°) for 1-En′,17 it was (χ31, χ32) = (85°, −66°)
for En-01, which is similar to the values calculated for 1-dPPE-NH2. The assignment of the g+g– side
chain conformation of Glu3 to 1-En′ probably resulted
in a clash between the carboxylic group of Glu3 and the C=C
bond that did not occur with the butanal reactant.

Stereoselective
C–C Bond Formation
We then studied
the stereoselective C–C bond formation resulting from the addition
of En-01 of 1-En to β-nitrostyrene. Depending on
the relative orientations of the prochiral centers,18a,19 four different enamine → nitrostyrene facial approaches were
considered. The re → re, re → si, si → re, and si → si approaches lead, respectively, to the four possible diastereomers
(2S,3R), (2S,3S), (2R,3R), and (2R,3S) for the nitronate 1-Nit
(Scheme 2). For each
enantiomer, three different orientations [i.e., gauche– (g–), gauche+ (g+), and
trans (t)] of the double bonds of enamine and nitrostyrene were considered.

Scheme 2 Four Different Approaches of the Prochiral Centers of Enamine 1-En and β-Nitrostyrene to Form the C–C Bond
The re → re, re → si, si → re, and si → si approaches resulted the (2S,3R), (2S,3S),
(2R,3R), and (2R,3S) enantiomeric products of nitronate 1-Nit (Scheme 1b),
respectively. For each enantiomer, three different orientations [i.e.,
gauche– (g–), gauche+ (g+), and trans (t)] were considered for the double bonds
of enamine and nitrostyrene around the prochiral centers.

The procedure to construct the 12 initial 1-Nit structures
(only four enantiomers) and the corresponding transition states are
described in the Supporting Information. The torsion angles and relative thermodynamic properties of enantiomeric
transition states and products for the stereoselective C–C
bond formation in chloroform are listed in Table S2 of the Supporting Information. The free-energy profiles
for 12 stereoselective C–C bond formations between En-01 and
β-nitrostyrene in chloroform at the ωB97X-D/6-311++G(d,p)//SMD
M06-2X/6-31+G(d) level of theory are depicted in Figure 3.

for the 12 feasible stereoselective C–C
bond formations between En-01 and β-nitrostyrene depending on
the relative orientations of the prochiral centers. All free energies
are relative to the reaction complex (RC) + β-styrene system.

The torsion angles of the backbone
of dPPE-NH2 moiety
in all transition states and products were quite similar to each other.
The five lowest energy barriers were obtained for the re → re/t, re → si/g–, re → si/t, si → re/t,
and re → re/g– prochiral approaches. Although the barriers of the four first prochiral
approaches were 1.6, 2.3, 1.0, and 2.2 kcal mol–1 lower in free energy than that of the re → re/g– one, the corresponding products
were less preferred than the (2S,3R)-1-Nit (ΔΔG = 12.4, 4.9,
3.8, and 1.8 kcal mol–1, respectively). The nitronate
intermediates resulting from re → re/g+ and si → si/g+ approaches were lower in free energy (ΔΔG = −1.4 and −1.8 kcal mol–1); however, the energy barriers were found to be 1.4 kcal mol–1 higher than that of the re → re/g– prochiral approach. Hence, the re → re/g– prochiral
approach between enamine (1-En) and β-nitrostyrene
was kinetically and/or thermodynamically favored and appeared to be the major route for the C–C bond
formation, which produced the major (2S,3R)-1-Nit intermediate.

The three re → si/g–, re → si/t,
and si → re/t prochiral approaches
have the lower ΔG⧧ barriers
for the C–C bond formation than the re → re/g– approach, and the si → re/g+ approach has comparable
ΔG⧧ barrier to the re → re/g– approach.
In addition, these four prochiral approaches resulted in the somewhat
higher ΔG values for nitronate intermediate
(1-Nit) than the re → re/g– approach. Hence, the backward process
(i.e., the C–C bond dissociation) from 1-Nit to
intermediate I5 is kinetically feasible for these four prochiral approaches
as well. The ΔG⧧ barriers
for backward process were calculated as 12.1, 14.5, 17.7, and 15.3
kcal mol–1 for the re → si/g–, re → si/t, si → re/g+, and si → re/t prochiral
approaches, respectively, which are 7.2, 4.8, 1.6, and 4.0 kcal mol–1 lower than that of the re → re/g– approach, respectively.

In
addition, the possibility of further protonation of nitronate
intermediates produced by these four prochiral approaches was investigated.
The torsion angles and thermodynamic properties for the protonation
in chloroform at the ωB97X-D/6-311++G(d,p)//SMD M06-2X/6-31+G(d)
level of theory are listed in Table S7 of the Supporting Information. The free-energy profiles for the protonation
are depicted in Figure 4. The ΔG⧧ barriers for protonation
from nitronate intermediate were calculated as 17.5, 17.0, 19.1, and
21.3 kcal mol–1 for the re → si/g–, re → si/t, si → re/g+, and si → re/t prochiral
approaches, respectively, which are 5.4, 2.5, 1.4, and 6.0 kcal mol–1 higher than those of the corresponding backward processes,
respectively. Hence, the C–C bond formations via the four re → si/g–, re → si/t, si → re/g+, and si → re/t prochiral approaches are kinetically less feasible
because of the lower barriers for the backward process and the higher
barriers for protonation.

dissociation (via

approaches. All free energies are relative to the RC + β-styrene
system.

The optimized structures of transition
states and 1-Nit for re → re/g– are depicted in Figure 5. Interestingly, the re → re/g+, re → si/g+, and si → si/g– prochiral approaches
produced dihydrooxazines
as products (i.e., 1-D in Scheme 1b), but the barriers ΔG⧧ were 1.4, 3.1, and 5.9 kcal mol–1 higher than that of the re → re/g– prochiral approach and those appeared to be
kinetically less favored. In the Michael addition of propanal to β-nitrostyrene
catalyzed by diarylprolinol silyl ether, the ΔG⧧ barrier of the most preferred transition state
for the C–C bond formation via the (R,S) pathway in chloroform was recently calculated as 16.2
kcal mol–1 at the ωB97X-D/6-311++G(3df,3pd)//ωB97X-D/6-311G(d,p)
level of theory and the PCM solvation free energy at the ωB97X-D/6-311G(d,p)
level of theory,16b which is 5.7 kcal mol–1 lower than that of the re → re/g+ prochiral approaches produced dihydrooxazines
as products (i.e., 1-D in Scheme 1b) in the present work.

and β-nitrostyrene with (a) gauche– and (b)

The distances d(C···C) in transition
states are represented by dotted lines and in Å. H-Bonds were
also represented by dotted lines.

In addition, we studied the stereoselective C–C bond
formation
of the next most preferred conformers [i.e., En-02, En-03, and En-04
shown in Figure 2;
populated at 17, 16, and 9%, respectively]. Only the re → re prochiral approach in the g– orientation of the double bonds was considered for these addition
reactions, which resulted the major (2S,3R)-1-Nit species. The procedure to construct
these initial 1-Nit structures and the corresponding
transition states are described in the Supporting Information. The torsion angles and relative thermodynamic
properties of transition states and products for these stereoselective
C–C bond formation in chloroform at the ωB97X-D/6-311++G(d,p)//SMD
M06-2X/6-31+G(d) level of theory are listed in Table S3 of the Supporting Information.

level of theory are depicted in Figure 6. The torsion angles of the backbone of dPPE-NH2 moiety in the transition state and 1-Nit of
each enamine species were similar to the corresponding values of En-02,
En-03, and En-04, although there were somewhat large changes of +46°,
+36°, and +106° in ϕ3, ψ3, and χ32 of En-03, respectively (Table
S3 of the Supporting Information). The
ΔG⧧ barriers of the re → re/g– prochiral
approaches for En-02, En-03, and En-04 with β-nitrostyrene were
9.9, 9.1, and 6.1 kcal mol–1 higher than that of
En-01, and the corresponding products were much less preferred than
En-01 (ΔΔG = 19.4, 18.4, and 15.6 kcal
mol–1, respectively). Hence, the re → re/g– prochiral approach
between En-01 and β-nitrostyrene was kinetically and thermodynamically favored and appeared to be
the major route for the C–C bond formation, which produced
the major (2S,3R)-1-Nit intermediate.

Exploration of the Nitronate
or Dihydrooxazine Pathways
Whatever the pathway considered,
i.e., 1-Nit (re → re/g–) or 1-D (re → re/g+) pathway, the next step of the catalytic
cycle requires a
water molecule that participates in the protonation of the species.
In the 1-D hypothesis, conversion of dihydrooxazine into
a cyclobutane adduct should also be considered because this species
has been experimentally observed with diphenylprolinol trimethylsilyl
ether as catalyst.16

Considering
the 1-Nit pathway, the initial ts structure was constructed
by introducing a water molecule into the (2S,3R)-1-Nit model obtained from the most preferred re → re/g– prochiral
approach and was optimized at the SMD M06-2X/6-31+G(d) level of theory
in chloroform. The same procedure was used to construct the ts structure
for the protonation step of the (2S,3R)-1-D dihydrooxazine intermediate. The free energy of
each intermediate and transition state in chloroform was calculated
at the ωB97X-D/6-311++G(d,p)//SMD M06-2X/6-31+G(d) level of
theory.

The six-membered dihydrooxazine ring in the hydrated
(2S,3R)-1-D model adopted
a
boat conformation. However, the structure of (2S,3R)-1-D with a half-chair conformation was also
considered because such a conformation was proposed in the nitro-Michael
addition catalyzed by diphenylprolinol trimethylsilyl ether.16a Nevertheless, the later was 3.1 kcal mol–1 less stable in chloroform than the corresponding
structure in boat conformation. The ΔG⧧ barriers for the protonation step of (2S,3R)-1-Nit and (2S,3R)-1-D in boat conformation were
calculated to be 12.4 and 14.3 kcal mol–1 (see Figure 7a). Again, this confirms
the re → re/g– prochiral approach as the most preferred pathway.

Figure 7 Free-energy profiles
for (a) the protonation of dihydrooxazine
oxide species (2S,3R)-1-D and (b) its transition to the cyclobutane adduct (2S,3R)-1-C in chloroform (see Scheme 1b). H-Bonds are represented
by dotted lines. All free energies are relative to the RC + β-styrene
system.

Next, we explored the transition
of the hydrated dihydrooxazine
species (1-D) to the cyclobutane adduct (1-C). The structure of the hydrated (2S,3R)-1-C was constructed from (2S,3R)-1-D and then optimized at the
SMD M06-2X/6-31+G(d) level of theory in chloroform. The initial transition
state was obtained by the relaxed scan of (2S,3R)-1-D at the SMD M06-2X/6-31+G(d) level of
theory in chloroform. The distance between the C3 and C6 atoms of
the oxazine decreased from 2.851 to 1.574 Å, whereas the length
of intracyclic C6–O1 bond increased from 1.512 to 3.196 Å
over 10 steps. The maximum energy was found at the eighth step, and
then, the ts structure was reoptimized at the same level of theory
in chloroform.

The free-energy profile for the protonation of
dihydrooxazine oxide
species (2S,3R)-1-D
and its transition to the cyclobutane adduct (2S,3R)-1-C in chloroform is depicted in Figure 7. The ΔG⧧ barrier associated with the transition
of (2S,3R)-1-D to (2S,3R)-1-C in chloroform was
calculated as 11.3 kcal mol–1, which is 3.0 kcal
mol–1 lower than that found for the protonation
of 1-D (Figure 7b). In addition, the structure of (2S,3R)-1-C was 5.5 kcal mol–1 more stable than (2S,3R)-1-D, indicating that, when formed, the dihydrooxazine oxide
species (1-D) should readily convert to cyclobutane adduct.
Because 1-C was never observed experimentally with dPPE-NH2 as catalyst, the 1-D pathway involving the re → re/g+ prochiral
approach should be excluded.

In the Michael addition of propanal
to β-nitrostyrene catalyzed
by diarylprolinol silyl ether, the ΔG⧧ barriers for the transition of dihydrooxazine oxide species D into
the cyclobutane adduct C and for the C–C bond formation and
protonation of dihydrooxazine oxide species D in the presence of p-nitrophenol were calculated as 11.9, 15.9, and 18.1 kcal
mol–1, respectively, at the ωB97X-D/6-311++G(3df,3pd)//ωB97X-D/6-311G(d,p)
level of theory and the PCM solvation free energy at the ωB97X-D/6-311G(d,p)
level of theory.16b The ΔG⧧ barrier for the D → C transition
is quite similar to 11.3 kcal mol–1 for the transition
of (2S,3R)-1-D to (2S,3R)-1-C in chloroform in
the present work. However, the ΔG⧧ barriers for the C–C bond formation and protonation of dihydrooxazine
oxide species D were 6.0 kcal mol–1 lower and 3.8
kcal mol–1 higher, respectively, than those of the re → re/g+ prochiral
approaches produced dihydrooxazines as products (i.e., 1-D in Scheme 1b) in
the present work.

Plausible Organocatalytic Cycle by dPPE-NH2
The procedure to construct the initial structures
for the plausible
organocatalytic cycle catalyzed by dPPE-NH2 was described
in the Computational Methods. The plausible
pathway for the addition of butanal to β-nitrostyrene catalyzed
by dPPE-NH2 (1) obtained at the ωB97X-D/6-311++G(d,p)//SMD
M06-2X/6-31+G(d) level of theory is depicted in Figure 8 (reactant complex, transition state, intermediate,
and product complex are abbreviated as RC, ts, I, and PC, respectively).
Their corresponding thermodynamic properties are shown in Table 3. All the ΔG values were calculated with respect to the total Gibbs
free energy of the reactant complex system formed by dPPE-NH2 and β-nitrostyrene. The torsion angles of dPPE-NH2 for reactant, transition states, intermediates, and product for
the organocatalytic addition of butanol to β-nitrostyrene by
dPPE-NH2 are listed in Table S7 of the Supporting Information. The free-energy profile for the organocatalytic
cycle is depicted in Figure 9. The essential reaction species such as ts3 for the enamine
formation, I4 (the enamine intermediate En), ts5 for the protonation
of nitronate, ts7 for hydrolysis, and the final PC are shown in Figure 10. All other structures
of RC, transition state, intermediate, and PC optimized in chloroform
are depicted in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information.

All intermediates and transition
states of the catalytic cycle
adopted a βI structure similar to that found for peptide 1 (see 1-dPPE-NH2 in Figure 1a). The structures are stabilized by a C10 H-bond between the C=O of d-Pro1 and the
C-terminal amide NH2 [distance d(C=Od-Pro1···H–NC-terminal) = 1.97–2.09 Å]. A second H-bond involving the Cδ=Oε1 and NH proton of Glu3 was
also conserved all along the catalytic pathway [d(Cδ=OGlu3ε1···H–NGlu3) = 1.75–1.95 Å].

In the first step of the catalytic
cycle, peptide 1 and butanal [d(Cδ=OGlu3ε1···H–Obutanal) = 1.64 Å] proceed to a first carbinol amine intermediate
I1 via the transition state ts1 [d(Nd-Pro1···C=Obutanal)
= 2.29 Å and d(C=Obutanal···H–OGlu3ε2) = 1.60
Å] with a barrier ΔG⧧ = 6.2 kcal mol–1. The carbinol amine I2 results
from the prototropy of the d-Pro1 NH to the carboxylate of
Glu3. Dehydration of I2 under the control of Glu COOH leads to the
iminium species I3 via the transition state ts2 (ΔG⧧ = 8.5 kcal mol–1). The water
molecule abstracts a proton from the CH2β of iminium
I3 in the transition state ts3 (Figure 10a) with ΔG⧧ = 17.5 kcal mol–1, which yields the enamine intermediate
I4 (Figure 10b). In
particular, I4 adopts a structure identical to the most preferred
conformer En-01 (Figure 2a), except that a water molecule was bound to the side chain carboxylic
H–Oε2 of Glu3 in I4 [d(Owater···H–OGlu3ε2) = 1.71 Å].

In the
second step of the catalytic cycle, the re → re/g– prochiral approach
of β-nitrostyrene is assisted by the Glu COOH that binds the
nitro group. The bimolecular intermediate I5 proceeds to the nitronic
acid I6, in which the carboxylic hydrogen is transferred to the nitronate
group [d(NO-HNO2···OGlu3ε2–) = 1.55 Å]. The transition state ts4 described in Figure 4a has the highest
barrier of the catalytic cycle (ΔG⧧ = 20.5 kcal mol–1) and the stereoselective (2S)-C–(3R)-C bond formation is thermodynamically and/or thermodynamically controlled.

The third step of the catalytic cycle consists
in the protonation
of the nitronic acid. A second bimolecular species I7 is formed by
introduction of a water molecule that is doubly coordinated to the
β-nitronate group and the carboxylic group of Glu3. In the transition
state ts5 (Figure 10c), the nitronate picks up a proton from the water molecule with
the assistance of the Glu COOH group to form I8. The protonation step
is recognized as the second highest barrier of the reaction pathway
(ΔG⧧ = 19.6 kcal mol–1).

The final step consists of the iminium hydrolysis.
The water molecule
shifts in close proximity of the iminium moiety. Intermediate I9 then
proceeds to the carbinol amine I10 via the transition state ts6 with
a relatively low energy barrier (ΔG⧧ = 5.8 kcal mol–1). In ts6, the water molecule
bridges both the iminium Cα and the carboxylate group. Prototropy
of acid proton, that is initially H-bonded to the nitrate group in
I10, to the nitrogen atom of d-Pro1 leads to I11. I11 is
stabilized by a new H-bond between the OH group of carbinol amine
and the carboxylate of Glu3 in I11. Finally, the abstraction of the
proton of the hydroxyl group by the Glu3 carboxylate as highlighted
in Figure 10d [ts7: d(Nd-Pro1···C=Oproduct) = 2.09 Å and d(C=Oproduct···H–OGlu3ε2) = 1.58 Å] facilitates the
breaking of the C–N bond and the recycling of the catalyst.
This elementary step requires a relatively low ΔG⧧ = 9.5 kcal mol–1. The final
product complex, in which the product and catalyst are H-bonded [d(C=Oproduct···H–OGlu3ε2) = 1.67
Å], is 1.2 kcal mol–1 more stable in ΔG than the RC + β-nitrostyrene system.

According
to the calculated ΔG⧧ values
with respect to the total Gibbs free energy of the RC + β-nitrostyrene
system, ts4 for the C–C bond formation and ts5 for the protonation
of the nitronic acid intermediate exhibited higher barriers of ΔG⧧ = 20.5 and 19.6 kcal mol–1, respectively. Hence, it confirms that the C–C bond formation
between the enamine and the electrophile is the rds. However, the
protonation of nitronic acid requires energy comparable with the C–C
bond formation. These calculated results are consistent with the kinetic
studies, which provided insights that not the enamine formation but
the reaction of the enamine with the electrophile is rate limiting
in case of catalysts bearing an acid group in a position that allows
for coordination of the nitrate.9b,9c,11

Conclusions
By conformational search,
it was confirmed that the catalyst H-d-Pro-Pro-Glu-NH2 (dPPE-NH2; 1) and its enamine intermediate
(1-En) adopted a dominant
conformation with a βI structure stabilized by a C10 H-bond between the C=O of d-Pro1 and the C-terminal
NH2 proton and with an additional H-bonds between the side
chain and the backbone of Glu3. The βI structure is conserved
along the catalytic cycle.

The stereoselective (2S)-C–(3R)-C bond formation between enamine
(1-En) and β-nitrostyrene
proceeds via the re → re prochiral
approach with the gauche– orientation of the double
bonds of reactants. Although it was suggested the possible formation
of dihydrooxazine oxide species (1-D), this process was
confirmed to be kinetically less accessible than the acyclic nitronate
pathway.

By exploring the pathways for addition of butanal to
β-nitrostyrene
catalyzed by catalyst dPPE-NH2 using DFT methods in chloroform,
the C–C bond formation between the enamine and the electrophile
(β-nitrostyrene) was confirmed as the rds. However, the protonation
by a water molecule to nitronic acid requires energy comparable to
the C–C bond formation. These calculated results are consistent
with the kinetic studies. In particular, our calculated results supported
that the central role of the carboxylic acid group of Glu3 in dPPE-NH2 by acting as general acid/base all along the catalytic cycle
and orienting the asymmetric C–C bond formation.

Computational
Methods
DFT Calculations
All Hartree–Fock (HF) and density
functional calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 programs.20 All density functional calculations of optimizations
and vibrational frequencies were carried out using the M06-2X functional21 and the solvation model based on density (SMD)
method.22 GaussView23 was used to generate and edit the structures of all intermediates
and transition states. The M06-2X is a hybrid-meta-GGA functional
with the improved medium-range correlation energy and showed good
performance in predicting noncovalent interactions of small molecules
and structures and relative stabilities of biological compounds such
as peptides.24

For all reactants,
intermediates, transition states, and products optimized at the SMD
M06-2X/6-31+G(d) level of theory in chloroform, the relative energy
(ΔE) of each local minimum in chloroform was
calculated as the sum of the relative single-point energy (ΔE0) using the ωB97X-D functional25 with the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set and the relative
solvation free energy (ΔΔGs) at the SMD M06-2X/6-31+G(d) level of theory in chloroform. For
all local minima and transition states, vibrational frequencies were
calculated at the SMD M06-2X/6-31+G(d) level of theory in chloroform
at 25 °C and 1 atm to confirm the nature of the stationary points
and to obtain relative enthalpies and Gibbs free energies of intermediates
and transition states at the same level of theory. The scale factor
used was 0.9440 at the SMD M06-2X/6-31+G(d) level of theory; this
value was chosen to reproduce the experimental frequency for the amide
I band of N-methylacetamide in Ar and N2 matrices.26 The intrinsic reaction coordinate
method27 was used to confirm each transition
state whether it connects the corresponding reactants and products.
In addition, each transition state was confirmed by checking the motions
of normal modes using GaussView,23 which
were involved in the formation and dissociation of the bonds in the
corresponding reactant and product. Notably, consistent with CD and
NMR experiments, the ωB97X-D/6-311++G(d,p)//SMD M06-2X/6-31+G(d)
level of theory correctly predicted the conformational populations
of the backbone and prolyl peptide bond for the Pro dipeptide in solution.28 In addition, the ωB97X-D functional exhibited
better performance than double-hybrid functionals DSD-BLYP, B2GPPLYPD,
and B2PLYP with dispersion corrections with respect to the benchmark
CCSD(T)/CBS-limit energies of Diels–Alder reactions (the DARC
set29).30

Conformational Search
We investigated the conformational
preferences of dPPE-NH2 and its enamine intermediate (1 and 1-En in Scheme 1, respectively) obtained by reaction with
butanal. The initial structure of peptide 1 was constructed
using the X-ray structure of H-d-Pro-Pro-Asp-NH29b and optimized at the M06-2X/6-31+G(d)
level of theory. Then, the initial structure of the enamine 1-En in the s-trans configuration was constructed from the
optimized structure of peptide 1 and optimized at the
same level of theory. Using these optimized structures, 157 and 189
initial structures for 1 and 1-En, respectively,
were generated by the systematic search of the Discovery Studio package31 using the CHARMm force field with the maximum
systematic conformations = 1000 and the energy threshold = 10 kcal
mol–1. In the conformational search of 1 and 1-En, a systematic variation of each of the torsion
angles ψ1, ψ2, ϕ3, and ψ3 of the backbone and χ31, χ32, and χ33 of the side chain of Glu3 was done using steps of 60°.
These initial structures were then optimized at the HF/3-21G(d) level
of theory, and we obtained 21 and 57 local minima with the relative
energy ΔE < 10 kcal mol–1, respectively, which were reoptimized at the M06-2X/6-31G(d) level
of theory and further optimized at the SMD M06-2X/6-31+G(d) level
of theory in chloroform.

Construction of Organocatalytic Cycle
The most preferred
conformations 1-dPPE-NH2 of peptide 1 (Table 1 and Figure 1a) and En-01 of 1-En (Table 2 and Figure 2a) obtained by the
conformational search were used to construct the initial structures
in the organocatalytic cycle. In particular, the C–C bond formation
between enamine (1-En) and β-nitrostyrene was considered
by the re → re/g– prochiral approach, which was kinetically and/or thermodynamically favored, as described earlier. In addition,
the initial structures of intermediates and transition states for
addition of butanal to β-nitrostyrene catalyzed by 1 were constructed using the structures of intermediates and transition
states suggested by Clemente and Houk32 for the enamine mechanism of intramolecular aldol reactions catalyzed
by proline as a reference, which involves an enamine intermediate
with concerted C–C bond formation and proton transfer from
the carboxylic acid group to the carbonyl acceptor. The overall reaction
mechanism of intramolecular aldol reactions catalyzed by proline appears
to be quite similar to the addition reaction of butanal to β-nitrostyrene
catalyzed by dPPE-NH2, except for the protonation step
being not necessary for the intramolecular aldol reactions.
