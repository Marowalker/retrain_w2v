Herein, we present a greener approach to achieve an ultrasensitive,
selective, and viable sensor engineered by amino acids as a recognition
layer for simultaneous electrochemical sensing of toxic heavy metals
(HMs). Electrochemical techniques like electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry
(SWASV) were applied to demonstrate sensing capabilities of the designed
analytical tool. The comparative results of different amino acids
demonstrate alanine’s superior performance with a well-resolved
and enhanced current signal for target metal ions due to strong complexation
of its functional moieties. The working conditions for alanine-modified
GCE were optimized by investigating the effect of alanine concentration,
different supporting electrolytes, pH values, accumulation potentials,
and time. The limits of detection
for Zn2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and Hg2+ were found to be 8.92, 5.77, 3.01, and 5.89 pM, respectively.
The alanine-modified electrode revealed absolute discrimination ability,
stability, and ultrasensitivity toward metal ions even in the presence
of multifold interfering species. Likewise, greener modifier-designed
electrodes possessed remarkable electrocatalytic activity, cost affordability,
reproducibility, and applicability for picomolar level detection of
HM ions in real water sample matrixes. Theoretical calculations for
the HM–amino acid interaction also support a significantly
improved mediator role of the alanine modifier that is consistent
with the experimental findings.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Heavy metal (HM) ions
(that have atomic density above 4–4.5
g/cm3) are proclaimed by worldwide organizations like WHO,
USEPA, and EPA as a risk to living species mainly due to their nonbiodegradable
nature and tendency to bioaccumulate.1 Major
causes of heavy metal toxicity in living organisms have been attributed
to urbanization and a concomitant exponential increase in human activities
such as the indiscriminate use of pesticides and fertilizers, metal
mining processes, automobile productions, bio solids and manures incineration,
and liberation of industrial and municipal wastewater in drinking
water bodies, which has irreversibly affected the natural environment.2 Heavy metals can cause serious health hazards
depending on the type of metal intoxication, its concentration and
duration of exposure.3 Although copper
and zinc are considered as essential trace elements for human metabolism,
yet, their excessive consumption can cause a number of complications,
few being: major organ damage and failure, biocatalytic inhibition,
DNA mutations, anemia, reduction in growth, and reproduction.4−6 Cadmium has been declared as carcinogenic and is poisonous even
in low amounts due to its ability to bioaccumulate by replacing calcium
in the body and causes serious disorders and impairment to functioning
of vital organs.7,8 Similarly, mercury poisoning may
lead to several fatal complications in the body.9,10 Therefore,
the detection and elimination of these HMs from water resources are
ever more necessary for public health safety.

Detection of inorganic
water toxins, that is, heavy metal ions
via classical analytical techniques, involves tedious sample preparation,
complex operations, expensive, and nonportable equipments as reported
in literature.11,12 Therefore, the development of
a user-friendly, robust, selective, and highly sensitive green analytical
platform for the simultaneous detection of HMs is of utmost importance.
In this regard, electrochemical analytical methods offer an easy,
onsite, and adaptable approach for trace level detection of HMs. Amongst
these methods, anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) is the method of
choice over conventional methods as it is of low cost and offers short
analytical time, a wide electrochemical window, and a favorable signal-to-noise
ratio that allows trace level detection of species.8,12 Additionally,
modification of the working electrode with an electroactive recognition
layer in ASV promises improved functionality of the sensor with enhanced
oxidation signals, detection limits, and selectivity for the respective
metal ions.

Recognition layers constituting various molecules
including organic,
inorganic, bio-, nanomaterials, and surfactants have been widely reported
as electrochemical sensors for metal ions.8,10,13−19 Similarly, amino acids and peptides are reported to be used as a
recognition layer on the electrode surface for metal ion detection
whereby strong complexes with metal ions are formed, and hence, an
effective sensing probe is developed.20−22 Electrochemical sensors
based on amino acids have a number of advantages over other modifiers
that include their tendency to bind with metal ions through their
chelating moieties such as amino −NH2, carboxylic
−COOH, hydroxyl −OH, or thiol −SH groups having
charge donating and complex stabilizing abilities, favorable adsorption
sites, eco-friendliness, availability in nature, and hence being economical.

In this perspective, the present research describes the design
and fabrication of an amino acid-based ultrasensitive electrochemical
sensor for detecting toxic metal ion concentrations below the threshold
value suggested by EPA and WHO. To this end, four different amino
acids, alanine, threonine, lysine, and glutamic acid, that is, a nonpolar,
a polar, a basic, and an acidic amino acid, respectively, have been
used to develop an electrochemical sensor for simultaneous detection
of zinc, cadmium, copper, and mercuric (Zn2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Hg2+, respectively) ions in spiked
and real samples. In present work, amongst the different modifiers,
best sensing properties were observed by using alanine as the recognition
layer due to its highly favorable interactions with the targeted metal
ions. We believe that this is the first work of its kind reporting
a simple, cost affordable, and easy to use electrochemical method
based on an amino acid-modified electrode for sequestering toxic HM
ions such as Zn2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and
Hg2+ down to picolevel concentrations in water systems
with robust and novel figures of merit.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Electrochemical Characterization of the Amino
Acid-Fabricated Electrode
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed
to characterize amino acid-modified electrodes by probing a current
response of the 5 mM [Fe(CN)] 3–/4– redox
couple in contrast to bare GCE in 0.1 M KCl as the supporting electrolyte. Figure 1A demonstrates a
noticeable increase in the reversible electrochemical signal of the
[Fe(CN)] 3–/4– redox couple at amino acid-immobilized
GCE compared to bare GCE, indicating that amino acids facilitate accessibility
of the redox probe to the electrode surface by reducing the barrier
to interfacial electron transfer processes and enhancing the current
signals. However, the most intense signals were achieved with alanine-modified
GCE due to its small size and simple molecular geometry that allows
more alanine molecules to occupy the electrode surface. Consequently,
the presence of more alanine molecules at the electrode surface not
only creates more active sites for analyte accumulation but also provides
faster electron transduction of the redox probe at the interface of
the designed sensor.

GCE and

GCE in a medium containing 5 mM K3[Fe(CN)6]
solution and a 0.1 M KCl electrolyte. (B) Nyquist plots using electrochemical
impedance spectroscopic data with applied frequency ranges varying
from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. (Inset) Randles equivalent circuit model for
the system under study showing resistors, capacitor, and Warburg impedance
elements.

Successful fabrication of the modified working
electrode and charge
transduction of the redox probe via bare GCE and amino acid-modified
GCEs were characterized by employing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) in the form of Nyquist plots at a frequency ranging from 100
kHz to 0.1 Hz in an electrochemical cell employing a 5 mM aqueous
solution of the [Fe(CN)]3–/4– redox couple
in a supporting electrolyte of 0.1 M KCl. A semicircle portion of
Nyquist plots shown in Figure 1B demonstrates the electronic transmission capability of the
modified and bare electrodes with relation to the redox couple. A
higher frequency range part of the Nyquist plot characterizes the
charge-transfer controlled process, whereas a lower frequency range,
that is, the linear section of the plot, demonstrates the dominance
of the diffusional process.23 Out of all
modifiers, the smallest semicircular diameter obtained for Ala/GCE
reflects enhanced interfacial electronic transduction of the redox
couple toward the modified electrode and shows reduced charge-transfer
resistance (Rct) as determined qualitatively.
Thus, the alanine-modified electrode offers minimum resistance during
interfacial charge transfer and provides excellent conductivity as
compared to other amino acid-modified electrodes. Quantitative values
of Rct, n (quality factor
of a capacitor), and constant phase element (CPE) enlisted in Table 1 were obtained from
synchronization of EIS data with the Randles equivalent electric circuit
model. The resistive values corresponding to Lys/GCE (Rct = 3.34 kΩ), Glu/GCE (Rct = 2.62 kΩ), Thr/GCE (Rct = 1.77
kΩ), and Ala/GCE (Rct = 0.50 kΩ)
were lower than the bare GCE (Rct = 6.41
kΩ), which indicates superior conductance and rapid heterogeneous
electron transfer kinetics of the amino acid-based GCE especially
for alanine-designed sensor, which corroborates well with the CV results,
indicating successful fabrication of the electrode surface for achieving
a more sensitive electrochemical sensing platform.

The remarkable electrocatalytic function of the modifiers
at the
electrode surface can be determined by a kinetic parameter, that is,
an exchange current density (Jo), the
value of which corresponds to the feasibility of electrochemical reaction
at the electrode interfacial surface. The exchange current density
(Jo) can be calculated by the equation  where R, n, F, T, and Rct are the gas constant, number of electrons involved in the
electrode reaction (here n = 1 for [Fe(CN)]3–/4– redox reaction), Faraday’s constant, temperature (here T = 298 K), and charge-transfer constant, respectively.24 The higher exchange current density of alanine-modified
GCE is attributed to an active electrode surface area due to availability
of more alanine active sites which in turn offers less hindrance to
the electron transfer of the redox probe as compared to other amino
acids and bare GCE as listed in Table 1.

Square-wave voltammograms in Britton-Robinson
buffer (BRB of pH
4) as a supporting electrolyte were recorded at bare and modified
GCEs, functionalized with different amino acids viz alanine, threonine,
glutamic acid, and lysine and demonstrated an enhanced oxidation current
response in comparison to bare GCE for the detection of 10 μM
Zn2+, 7.5 μM Cd2+, 5 μM Cu2+ and 7.5 μM Hg2+ ions. SWASV involves electroreduction
at a deposition potential of −1.3 V for 140 s followed by their
stripping from the modified electrode surface into solution during
anodic stripping by scanning from −1.3 to 0.8 V. Similarly,
electroreduction and stripping steps were applied on bare GCE for
comparative voltammetric studies of respective metal ions with amino
acid (AA)-modified electrodes. All modifiers exhibited an increase
in the response of oxidation signals for Zn2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and Hg2+ ions than the bare GCE, which
agrees with CV and EIS results as depicted in Figure 2. It is contended that electrodeposition
of amino acids on GCE binds the amino group covalently with the GCE
while the negatively charged carboxylic groups are freely available
to uptake positively charged analytes.25 The higher surface area of amino acid-modified GCEs under optimized
conditions of SWASV allows greater amounts of metal ions to be coupled
to the surface, thus allowing it to accumulate more of the analytes
than bare GCE. SWASV results revealed enhancement in the oxidation
current Ip of the copper, cadmium, zinc,
and mercury ions at the alanine-modified glassy carbon electrode owing
to a provision of more adsorptive sites, which points toward easy
accessibility of its carboxylic acid groups to metal ions in the solution
for strong interactions between them. Another important factor to
consider with regard to effective adsorption of amino acid at the
electrode surface and its interaction with the analyte of interest
is the steric hindrance as a result of its chemical structure. Hence,
although threonine amino acid is polar in structure and has more electron
donor functional groups, yet, its sensing behavior is inferior to
alanine due to the steric hindrance of its comparatively bulky structure.
Hence, alanine provides most intense SWV oxidative current signals Ip for given metal cations than the other investigated
amino acids due to its small size, minimum steric hindrance, and simple
molecular geometry, which affords faster electron transduction from
analytes toward the electrode surface. Hence, for further electrochemical
measurements, alanine amino acid was selected as the best electrocatalyst
for simultaneous sensing of metals, Zn2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and Hg2+ ions.

Figure 2 SWASV obtained from unmodified
and alanine, threonine, glutamic
acid, and lysine amino acid-modified GC electrodes for the detection
of 10 μM Zn2+, 7.5 μM Cd2+, 5 μM
Cu2+, and 7.5 μM Hg2+ in BRB of pH = 4
as striping solvent, keeping a scan rate of 100 mV/s, a deposition
potential of −1.3 V, and a deposition time of 140 s.

2.2 Optimization of Conditions for the Best Performance
of Alanine Modifier
The experimental conditions that affect
the intensity and shape of peaks were investigated to get the maximum
current signals by effective coordination of l-alanine with
Zn2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and Hg2+ ions. The influences of various critical factors including concentration
of the modifier, stripping electrolyte, pH of solution,26 deposition potential, and accumulation time
for preconcentration of metal ions were studied at 100 μM Zn2+, 75 μM Cd2+, 50 μM Cu2+, and 75 μM Hg2+ ions, and values were optimized
for further investigations.

The increase in the alanine concentration
on the GCE surface was found to significantly improve the magnitude
of electro-oxidation signals for metals ions at the modified electrode
that can be related to the provision of more active sites as the concentration
of the modifier is increased. As the concentration of alanine increased,
facilitation in the electron transfer process increased at the electrode
surface up to an optimum concentration. However, after the optimum
concentration of alanine, that is, 65 μM, a reduction in the
peak current was noticed as evident from Figure 3A,B that can be related to saturation of
active sites, an increase in electrode resistivity and passive electron
transfer due to multilayer adsorption of amino acid molecules over
the electrode surface.

Zn2+, 75 μM Cd2+, 50 μM Cu2+, and 75 μM Hg2+ ions in BRB of pH = 4, keeping
scan rate = 100 mV/s, deposition time = 5 s, deposition potential
= −1.3 V by electrochemical assisted modification of GC electrode
surface with different concentrations of alanine solution. (B) Plot
of Ip vs alanine (modifier) concentration.

The SWASV responses of Ala/GCE for different metal
ions in different
electrolytic media were monitored in 0.1 M NaOH, 0.1 M H2SO4, 0.1 M HCl, 0.1 M KCl, phosphate buffer solution (PBS
of pH = 7), Britton-Robinson Buffer (BRB of pH = 4), and acetate buffer
solution (ABS of pH = 4.8) as supporting electrolytes. The supporting
electrolyte helps to decrease the ohmic or I–R drop and opposes the effect of migration current. The
bar graph for quantification of the peak current intensity in the
presence of various supporting electrolytes is illustrated in Figure 4A registered BR buffer
of pH 4 as the most suitable supporting electrolyte for stripping
of electro-reduced metal ions back into the solution to provide well-resolved
oxidation peaks for metal ions.

Figure 4 (A) Effect of various stripping media
(supporting electrolytes)
such as BRB (pH = 4), phosphate buffer (pH = 7), acetate buffer (pH
= 4.8), 0.1 M HCl, 0.1 M NaOH, 0.1 M KCl, 0.1 M H2SO4, and 0.1 M H3BO3 on the SWASV peak
currents of 100 μM Zn2+, 75 μM Cd2+, 50 μM Cu2+, and 75 μM Hg2+ ions
using 65 μM Ala/GCE, a deposition potential of −1.3 V,
and an accumulation time of 5 s at a scan rate of 100 mV/s. (B) The
plots of SWASV anodic peak currents Ip as a function of pH of BRB (3–9) obtained from 65 μM
Ala/GCE at an accumulation time of 5 s, a deposition potential of
−1.3 V with a scan rate of 100 mV/s.

Similarly, pH of the supporting electrolyte influences
the binding
ability of the metal ions by having an impact on the electrode surface
charge transduction,26 proton availability
in solution, and ionization of modifier functional groups. In this
regard, the plots of E and Ip versus pH for 100 μM Zn2+, 75 μM Cd2+, 50 μM Cu2+, and 75 μM Hg2+ ions as illustrated in Figure 4B were established by inspecting BRB in a wide range
of pH values from 3.0 to 9.0 at a deposition time of 5 s to study
the electrode reaction at an optimized pH value. The plot designates
the maximum voltammetric signals at pH 4 of BRB that can be related
to a pH-dependent ionization of the carboxylate group present in the
chemical structure of alanine for effective complex formation with
metal ions. However, at very low pH protonation of carboxylate ion
results, thus having a low ability to complex with the metal ions,
leading to a decrease in oxidation signals for the metal ions. Similarly,
at higher pH, formation of metal hydroxides is suggested, that is,
Zn(OH)2, Cu(OH)2, Hg(OH)2, and Cd(OH)2, leading to decreased accessibility of the metal ions for
electroreduction at the alanine-modified GCE.27 Henceforth, BRB of pH 4 is selected as the optimum pH value to ensure
a superior metal ion complexation ability of alanine for all the succeeding
electroanalytical measurements.

The deposition step is quite
critical to control preconcentrated
accumulation of electrochemical species on the working electrode surface.28 The dependence of redox behavior of selected
analytes on the deposition potential at Ala/GCE was probed by varying
the accumulation potentials from −0.9 to −1.5 V. Figure 5A reveals that increasing
the negative deposition potential up to −1.3 V results in enhanced
voltammetric signals, which can be attributed to the maximum accumulation
of the metal ion species. Therefore, −1.3 V corresponds to
the maximum coverage of the electrode surface with completely reduced
analyte ions. Hence, the maximum loading of metals was accomplished
at an accumulation potential of −1.3 V. Furthermore, the impact
of the accumulation time on metal ion accumulation was also carried
out by studying the increase in stripping peak currents with the preconcentration
time. It was observed that the peak current increased with the deposition
time up to 140 s at a deposition potential of −1.3 V as depicted
in Figure 5B-I,II.
However, when the deposition time exceeded 140 s, the amount of metals
that can be reduced on Ala/GCE reached a limiting value as observed
by a decrease in the value of current with time. This can be attributed
to the complete surface coverage and saturation of available active
sites of the working electrode with electro-reduced metals.29 Therefore, as the deposition time increases,
the thickness of the electro-deposited analyte layers at the modified
electrode also increases and hinders any further mass transfer of
metal ions.30,31 Thus, 140 s was chosen to be
the optimal preconcentration deposition time for the detection of
corresponding Zn2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and
Hg2+ions. We can obtain the best SWASV response from Ala/GCE
for simultaneous detection of Zn2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and Hg2+ions by modifying GCE with 65 μM
alanine solution in an analyte solution of BRB of pH 4, at a deposition
potential of −1.3 V, and an accumulation time of 140 s.

Figure 5 (A) Plot of Ip vs Ed shows the
influence of accumulation potentials on the
oxidative peak currents of 100 μM Zn2+, 75 μM
Cd2+, 50 μM Cu2+, and 75 μM Hg2+ ions in BRB of pH = 4, a scan rate of 100 mV/s, and a deposition
time of 5 s at 65 μM Ala/GCE. (B-I) Effect of deposition times

2.3 Validation of Electrode Selectivity, Sensitivity,
Stability, and Quantification of Limits
The limit of detection
(LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of the sensor for a particular analyte
can be assessed from expressions such as: LOD = 3σ/m and LOQ = 10σ/m, where σ represents
the standard deviation of n times replicate of voltammograms
of the modified electrode in blank solution (electrolyte solution
in the absence of analyte), and m is the slope of
the concentration versus current plot.32Figure 6A depicts
SWASV peaks obtained for simultaneous multiple metal ions in the concentration
range from 100 μM down to 5 nM. It is observed in Figure 6A that, at high concentrations,
the oxidative peak current shows nonlinearity. However, our developed
electroanalytical sensor illustrates a board linearity range from
10 μM to 5 nM and the strongest correlation of the data, which
is evidenced from the values of the correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.99). Linear calibration curves of the
alanine-modified electrode ranging from 5 to 100 nM shown in Figure 6B provide excellent
LOD values, that is, 8.92, 5.77, 3.01, and 5.89 pM for zinc, cadmium,
copper, and mercuric ions, respectively, which are far below the WHO
and EPA recommendations.1 Additionally,
the Ala/GCE sensor offers low LODs for the metal cations under study
as compared to other amino acid-based GCEs in this study. It was observed
that an LOD of 3.01 pM for copper ions at Ala/GCE under optimized
conditions was the lowest among any other metal cation detected. Similarly,
cadmium and mercury with comparatively higher LODs of 5.77 and 5.89
pM at Ala/GCE showed almost equal current response and sensitivity
of the modified electrode, while zinc still needed a higher concentration
of 8.92 pM to be detected on Ala/GCE as compared to other metal cations.
Hence, it is concluded that alanine is most selective and sensitive
for complexation with copper than other target analytes, but at the
same time, it possesses better sensing ability and offers effective
interactions for all metal cations under investigation than other
amino acids as supported by theoretical calculations also(Section 2.5). Table 2 gives a comparison
of analytical parameters such as LODs obtained from Ala/GCE for detection
of metal ions compared to other electroanalytical metal sensors in
literature. The table reveals promising sensitivity of our alanine-based
sensor than graphene, carbon nanotubes, silver, gold, and cadmium
tellurium nanoparticles, nanocomposites, organic ligands, and polymers
fabricated sensors, which means that our developed amino acid sensor
can detect trace level concentrations of metal ions more effectively.9,10,26,32−50

ranges are mentioned above each peak. (B) Corresponding calibration

The designed sensor ability to discriminate the voltammetric
response
of respective metal ions in the presence of multifold concentrations
of interfering agents like commonly occurring cations and anions in
water and some strong complexing agents was thoroughly probed by electrochemical
techniques, and their effect on the electro-oxidation signals of metal
analytes is displayed in Figure 7A.51 SWASV results reveal
that alanine can recognize the target metal ions with no significant
deviation in their signals in the presence of the 2 mM concentrations
of added interfering ions such as K+, Na+, As3+, Ag+, Cs+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Co2+, Pb2+, and Cl– and surfactants, complexing agents, and organic compounds like SDS,
CTAB, EDTA, citric acid, glucose, 2-amino-4-nitrophenol, and 3-chloro-5-nitrophenol.
Hence, Figure 7A confirms
the selectivity and absolute discrimination ability of our sensor
to extract Cd2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and
Hg2+ ions simultaneously in the presence of multifold concentrations
of interfering species attributed to strong metal ion affinity for
the modifier at the GCE. The oxidative stripping peak current variations
with and without interfering species are presented as a bar graph
in Figure 7B and do
not show any significant effect on the SWASV current signals for the
targeted metal ions.

The stability and reliability of the designed electrode,
that is,
test–retest consistency of a sensor, were assessed by recording
successive four SWASVs at a single-modified electrode for 10 μM
Zn2+, 7.5 μM Cd2+, 5 μM Cu2+, and 7.5 μM Hg2+ ions detection in BRB (pH 4) under
predetermined optimum conditions, and their voltammograms displayed
no significant variation in electrochemical responses on repetitive
measurements as revealed in Figure 8A. The relative standard deviation (RSD) values of
an alanine-immobilized electrode were found to be below 2% that represents
excellent repeatability, stability, and durability of the electrode.
In a similar fashion, four different GC electrodes were modified by
alanine to check precise reproducibilities of the fabricated electrodes.
All electrodes displayed almost identical voltammetric signals with
relative standard deviation (RSD) values below 5% as shown in Figure 8B. Measured figure
of merits of the designed sensor are summarized in Table 3. This showed that our proposed
sensor is highly stable and durable due to its great repeatability
and reproducibility.

2.4 Application of the Designed Sensor to Real
Water Samples
The accuracy, applicability, and validity of
the proposed methodology for sensing of multiple water toxins were
investigated by using tap water and drinking water samples collected
from different sources in Islamabad, Pakistan. The samples were filtered
to remove residues and solid impurities and diluted by adding pH 4
BRB in the 1:1 ratio, and then, recovery tests were applied by spiking
known amounts of metal ions in samples to check precision and validity
of the fabricated electrode under optimum conditions. Quantities of
metal ions in the real samples were then evaluated by comparing their
peak current values with the calibration plots. In Table 4, percentage age recoveries
for our studied metal ions lies in the range from 90.2 to 99.6% with
RSD values less than 3.6%, which demonstrates robustness and selectively
of the developed sensor in detecting multiple metal ions with naturally
occurring interfering species in real water samples. This ensures
feasibility and precision of the designed sensor.

2.5 Theoretical Calculation for Designed AA/GCE
Sensor
The experimental findings were verified by theoretical
binding parameters of tested amino acid sensors by computational calculations
using Hyper Chem 8.0 software. First, the molecular geometry of tested
amino acid molecules was optimized by applying a semiempirical AM1
method on their structure. Then, by computing single point energy, functional parameters
like the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
energies, binding energies, and heat of formation were determined
to calculate chemical descriptors such as the band gap energy, ionization
energy, electrophilicity index, electron affinity, electronegativity,
chemical hardness, global softness, and chemical potential values52 as summarized in Table 5. The pictorial representation of frontier
molecular orbitals such as HOMO of tested amino acids is presented
in Figure 9. Chemical
activity of modifiers and the extent of favorable interactions between
amino acid molecules and metal ions can be assessed by energy band
gap values. The band gap energy of alanine (−11.26 eV) is much
higher compared to band gap energies of threonine, glutamic acid,
and lysine (−11.11, −11.20, and −10.62 eV, respectively),
which strongly suggest alanine’s high affinity for metal ions
coordination. Similarly, high chemical hardness and low global softness
values of alanine as compared to other amino acids used as recognition
layers corresponds to a larger frontier orbital gap that leads to
a kinetically more stable molecular structure. Moreover, the alanine
amino acid was observed to show the lowest binding energy (−1214.25
kcal/mol), that is, more stability than threonine, glutamic acid,
and lysine amino acids, which supports our experimental findings that
alanine can develop more effective interactions with targeted metal
ions than other tested amino acids and can be used as the best metal
ion sensor amongst them.

occupied molecular
orbital) of optimized structures of alanine, threonine, glutamic acid,

The complexation mechanism due to effective interactions
between
alanine and targeted metal ions was further explored by computational
modeling with computational density functional (DFT) program with
a B3LYP/LANL2DZ basis set at Gaussview 5.0 software. The chemical
descriptors were analyzed from HOMO and LUMO energy values of optimized
molecular geometries of alanine and its metal complexes as listed
in Table 6. Comparison
of metal–alanine complexes with individual entities reveals
that complexes have a low value of the frontier orbital gap and chemical
hardness, consequently high global softness, more polarizable structure,
and high electrophilicity index that relates to high chemical reactivity
and instability is observed. Theoretically, the total energy value
appears more negative for the alanine–copper ion complex Cu2+–Ala (−518.62 hartree) than the rest of alanine–metal
ion complexes Zn2+–Ala, Hg2+–Ala,
and Cd2+–Ala (−388.70, −365.83, and
−371.16 hartree, respectively) suggestive of strong complexation
of the copper ion with alanine compared to other metal ions present
in solution. However, total energy values for all complexes are more
negative in contrast to free alanine (−323.70 hartree) that
support an effective interaction between the alanine recognition layer
and analytes. The complexation and decomplexation of metals ions occur
during reductive deposition and oxidative stripping steps of SWASV.
Hence, these theoretical studies not only support the experimental
findings but also offer a working mechanism of the sensor suggesting
how alanine acts as a mediator to facilitate charge transduction between
the guest (metal ions) and the host (electrode) via the complexation
process.

3 Conclusions
An efficient transducer
based on l-alanine amino acid
as a recognition layer was developed for sequestering the multiple
water toxins (Zn2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and
Hg2+ ions) that exist in aqueous bodies. EIS, CV, and SWASV
results not only ensured fabrication and robustness of charge transfer
at the interfacial electrode surface but also verified significantly
boosted current signals for detection of multitarget analytes at alanine-immobilized
GCE compared to bare GCE. Furthermore, SWASV sensing conditions, that
is, modifier concentrations, stripping electrolytes, pH of solution,
deposition potentials, and accumulation time for preconcentrations
of metal ions, were optimized to achieve the maximum current signals
by effective coordination of l-alanine with targeted analytes.
The alanine recognition layer demonstrated absolute discrimination
ability and selectivity in the presence of multifold interferents,
remarkable electrocatalytic activity, reproducibility, stability,
and extraordinary sensitivity for metal-based water toxins even under
harsh conditions such as the presence of multifold interferents. Moreover,
the linear concentration range for the designed multitargeted metal
sensors lead to determine ultratrace picomolar LOD and LOQ values
that are far lower than threshold contamination levels of Zn2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and Hg2+ ions suggested
by EPA and WHO for drinking water. Additionally, computational studies
support experimental parameters, and the novel role of alanine as
a mediator for charge transfer between the recognition layer and analytes
by the mechanism of complexation–decomplexation is ascertained.
Moreover, the designed sensing platform demonstrates excellent figures
of merit in the context of percentage age recoveries of real samples,
hence offers its applicability as a promising analytical tool.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals
Chemicals used in present
work are l-alanine, l-lysine, l-threonine, l-glutamic acid, zinc acetate, cadmium chloride, cupric chloride,
mercuric chloride, acetic acid, HCl, NaOH, KCl, H2SO4, H3BO3, H3PO4, acetonitrile CAN, NBu4BF4, sodium acetate,
sodium phosphate dibasic heptahydrate, arsenic chloride, silver chloride,
strontium nitrate, cesium chloride, chromium chloride, sodium chloride,
cobalt chloride, lead nitrate, sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate,
calcium chloride, surfactants (CTAB, SDS), EDTA, glucose, citric acid,
2-amino-4-nitrophenol, and 3-chloro-5-nitrophenol. All chemicals selected
as analytes, recognition layers, electrolytes, and interfering agents
were procured from Sigma-Aldrich and utilized as received. All solutions
were prepared in doubly distilled water. Moreover, to investigate
the validity of the designed sensor in real water system, tap, and
drinking water samples were collected from different sources in Islamabad,
Pakistan.

4.2 Instrumentation
For electrochemical
investigation, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS), and square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV)
were performed on a Metrohm Auto lab PGSTAT302N having FRA and NOVA
1.11 software. A typical three-electrode system was used that consists
of a Pt wire as the counter electrode, a reference electrode constituting
the Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) electrode, and a bare glassy carbon electrode
(GCE) or an amino acid-modified glassy carbon electrode (AA/GCE) as
the working electrode. The working electrode was positioned at the
least distance from the reference electrode to minimize the IR drop
effect. The pH values of all electrolytes and solutions were adjusted
by using a 620 lab pH meter. All analytical data was collected at
room temperature. An inert atmosphere was maintained above analytical
solutions through continuous nitrogen gas purging.

4.3 Methodology for Electrode Modification
For electrode fabrication, a bare glassy carbon electrode was gently
rub on 6 and 1 μm alumina slurries having a nylon buffing pad
repeatedly to achieve a smooth shiny surface. Then, the polished electrode
was thoroughly washed with doubly distilled water. To obtain reproducible
surface conditions before modification, physical pretreatment was
followed by electrochemical pretreatment by passing the electrode
surface through several polarization cycles of −1.4 to +0.9
V in buffer media at 100 mVs–1 until reproducible
cyclic voltammogram was accomplished.

Then, the clean activated
electrode surface was covalently modified via electrochemical-aided
grafting of the known concentration of amino acids on the carbon surface.
To obtain modified electrode having a stable monolayer with a broad
potential range, bare GCE was scanned four times between 0 to +1.4
V with a scan rate of 10 mV/s by a cyclic voltammetric technique in
the solution of the selected amino acid in acetonitrile (ACN) having
0.1 M NBu4BF4 under inert atmosphere. At a sufficiently
positive potential, controlled electrolysis of amino acid solution
causes electrooxidation of its amino group and produces a corresponding
cation radical that forms carbon–nitrogen covalent linkage
at the electrode surface. Thus, individual amino acids are grafted
onto GCE through its N-terminus and allow the binding of analytes
from their carboxylic acid terminus during the complexation process
as shown in the modification Scheme 1.25,53 The modified electrode was cautiously
cleaned with ethanol and doubly distilled water to remove any physiosorbed,
unreacted, and loosely bound amino acid molecules. All cyclic voltammograms
with AA/GCE as WE in 0.1 M KCl in a potential range between −1.5
to +0.8 V, that is, working potential window for metal ions, revealed
no redox peak for amino acids. The prepared AA/modified electrodes
are ready to be used and can be stored in PBS (phosphate buffer) of
pH 6.0 at 4 °C.54,55 For simultaneous detection of
toxic metal ions, the modified electrode was then subjected to square-wave
anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV), which involves a deposition
step where a predefined deposition potential of −1.3 V for
a 140 s deposition time is applied to electroplate metal ions on the
electrode surface. While in the stripping step, the electro-reduced
metal ions are oxidized back into the solution during anodic stripping
with a potential scan ranging from −1.3 to 0.8 V.
