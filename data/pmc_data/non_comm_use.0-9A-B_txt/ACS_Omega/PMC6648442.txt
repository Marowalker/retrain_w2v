We
present simple and effective experiments to produce intricate
chemical patterns from common chemicals in a classroom setting. Students
selected an independent variable of their interest, designed their
experiment, and investigated its effect on chemical patterns in a
four-hour activity. Photographs and videos were taken, while the identity
and the concentration of chemicals in the reaction mixture, the concentration
of oxygen gas above the solution, the depth of the solution, the shape
and the total area of container’s cross section, and the temperature
were varied. Students discussed their results and presented their
investigation to the class. Our experiments enable students
to conduct inquiries with open-ended discussion and also open possibilities
for a chemical art competition.

==== Body
Introduction
In 1998, patterns in
the classical blue bottle experiment (see Scheme 1) were introduced
to the Journal of Chemical Education.1 Chemical pattern formations were also reported in similar
systems where autoxidation of various other reducing agents is catalyzed
by different redox dyes.2−6 Inspired by a recent report in Nature Catalysis,7 we present a series of experiments
to show chemical patterns from inexpensive classroom chemicals.

Scheme 1 Blue Bottle Reaction Scheme
If methylene blue is
used as
a catalyst, the colorless solution changes to blue after shaking and
the blue color turns back to colorless after a period of time. These
bluing/debluing cycles can be repeated a number of times. The reaction
can be generally described as an autoxidation of an acyloin to a diketone
catalyzed by a redox dye under a basic condition. In exceptional cases
of the green version of the reaction, ascorbic acid is the reducing
agent and additional catalysts are needed (Adapted from refs (5,6)).

Chemical pattern formations in the blue
bottle reaction are relatively
not well-understood compared to other well-known reactions such as
the Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.8 However, the blue bottle reaction involves only a few common and
inexpensive chemicals, and Scheme 1 is arguably simpler than scores of different steps
in the BZ reaction.9 In general, chemical
pattern formations in the blue bottle reaction may be modeled by the
reaction–diffusion scheme first proposed by Turing.10,11 This mathematical model is also used to explain a number of phenomena
that involve natural patterns and forms, for example, convection of
heated fluid, patterns on skin of animals, and patterned vegetation.12 By conducting this inquiry-style laboratory,
students appreciate the multidisciplinary nature of the experiment
(and the central role of chemistry) and are stimulated by the challenged
that they are working at the edge of known science.

Preparation and
Procedure
Stock solutions should be prepared in advance according
to Table 1. Final concentrations
optimized for pattern formation are shown in Table 2. For example, 150 mL of the reaction mixture
is prepared from 124.5 mL of water, 7.5 mL of methylene blue solution,
15 mL of glucose solution, and 3.0 mL of sodium hydroxide solution.
Sodium hydroxide is added last, and the reaction mixture is briefly
stirred before a transfer to a Petri dish. Students record the reaction time
from the moment that sodium hydroxide is added.

Table 1 Stock Concentrations

a The anhydrous formulae
and sodium
or chloride salts for dyes are shown in the table. Preparation should
be adjusted accordingly if hydrates and other counterions are present.

Figure 1 shows an
overview of experimental procedures. Roles of chemical and physical
factors in the pattern formation process can be investigated by students.The chemical factors include composition
of the solution
and the gas above the solution.

The physical
factors include the dimension of the reaction
mixture (depth, total area, shape of the area) and the temperature.



Figure 1 Different possible lines of investigation for chemical
patterns
in autoxidations catalyzed by redox dyes, chemical compositions of
the solution, physical dimension of the solution, oxygen gas concentration
above the solution, temperature, and time.

The investigation of these factors should be conducted by
taking
digital photography at regular time interval depending on the circumstance.
For example, photograph may be taken every 30 s at the beginning and
the end of the reaction but every 10 s when changes are occurring
very fast. Alternatively, a video may be taken instead. Students’
smartphones or cameras are usually adequate for this purpose, and
we only inform them in advance to bring their own equipment. Because
photographs are recorded with time, the first photograph should be
taken when caustic soda is added to tag the start time.

If possible,
experiments should be performed in parallel as much
as possible to save time and allow a fair comparison. For example,
the solution is prepared at once and separated into portions for different
depths of the solution. For different chemical compositions, students
work together to add caustic soda to Petri dishes at the same time.
Treatment groups and a control group (if applicable) are placed side-by-side
for photographing/filming. Students should be aware that chemical
patterns are sensitive to a number of environmental factors, for example,
wind from an air conditioner and table vibration. Even though the
pattern cannot be reproducible 100% in repeated experiments, general
trends are still observed.

Pedagogical Applications
Students
should be given some
background about the chemical pattern formation and the blue bottle
experiment (see refs (1−5)). Depending on the context, the
background information can be delivered as a separate laboratory session
or just a brief introduction. Students start by selecting one or two
factors for investigation. They discuss within their group to design
their experiments that may include treatment groups and a control
group. An instructor approval is usually needed before students can
carry out their proposed procedures.

In our context, this inquiry-based
laboratory is given at the very last week of the first chemical laboratory
course for undergraduate students. Our students have had prior knowledge
of the reaction by completing the first four activities of the blue
bottle experiment (see ref (5)’s Supporting Information) in one of the previous
lab sessions. Students work in groups because of the nature of the
work that required simultaneous mixing or transferring of chemicals
and limited lab space/equipment. At the end of the four-hour lab class,
they produce a full lab report and a short oral presentation of their
procedures and results to the class.

Reaction Mixture Composition
Alternative formulation
can be prepared by varying concentrations of reactants or use alternative
reactants,4,5 for example:Reducing agents: acetoin, benzoin, and sugar with α-hydroxy
ketone or α-hydroxy aldehyde

Dyes:
safranine, indigo carmine, resazurin, erioglaucine



Concentrations for safranine and indigo carmine are
shown in Tables 1 and 2. If other chemicals are available and students
choose to experiment with them, it is a challenge for them to prepare
the stock solutions and find appropriate concentrations for the experiment.

Oxygen Gas Concentration
Method A: A cylindrical
glass or plastic jar with secure cap is used instead of Petri dish.
Holes are made at the top of the equipment for gas to enter, for oxygen
probe, and for the solution to be poured in. Nitrogen or other chemically
inert gas is used to purge oxygen from the jar. It is also possible
to use oxygen gas (from gas tank or generated by a reaction13−15). In both elevated and depleted oxygen experiments, oxygen probe
can be inserted into the jar to measure the amount of oxygen in the
atmosphere above the reaction mixture.

Method B: The reaction mixture is prepared in a Petri dish. An inert mineral
oil7 or organic solvents or a lid may be
used to prevent oxygen to come into contact with the solution.

Physical
Dimension of the Solution
Method A: The reaction
mixture is prepared in a beaker and measured by a graduated
cylinder before transferring into Petri dishes. For example, students
may prepare 100 mL of the reaction mixture and quickly pour 10, 20,
30 mL, and the rest 40 mL into Petri dishes, and four different solution
depths can be obtained.

Method B: Different geometrical
shapes of the container can be obtained by 3D printing. Printable
files for containers with triangular, rectangular, pentagonal, hexagonal,
and circular bases of different cross-sectional areas (50, 100, and
150 cm2) are available in the Supporting Information. Depending on the quality and color of the printing,
printed products may need to be sanded and painted before use.

Temperature
The reaction mixture can be prepared in
a cylindrical glass or plastic jar immersed under a bath of warm or
cold water. The recommended temperature range for this experiment
is 15 °C, room temperature, and 35 °C. The reaction will
either proceed too slowly or will cause the mixture to turn yellowish
if the temperature is outside the range. The reaction mixture can
be made in two parts where sodium hydroxide is kept in a test tube
and the rest is kept in the jar. The jar and the tube are kept in
a water bath with constant stirring for about 5–10 min so that
the temperature of the solutions is the same as the solution of the
water. After this time, the test tube content can be added to the
jar to start the reaction.

Precautions and Hazards
Because sodium hydroxide is corrosive and dyes may stain, protective
goggles, lab coat, and gloves should be worn. If organic solvents
are used, this requires additional safety precautions. For example,
use of solvent on plasticware (disposable pipettes, syringes, and
Petri dishes) should be avoided. Detailed hazard information for each
chemical including alternative reagents and organic solvents was given
in our previous papers (refs (2,3)). The following points may be
useful for experiments involving dyes.Dye stain on glassware/clothes may be clean by organic
solvents/bleach solution.

Disposable
plastic pipettes, syringes, and Petri dishes
may be used and discarded.

Alternatively,
the biological stain dyes (methylene
blue and safranin) should be avoided, but food dyes (E132 indigo carmine,
E133 erioglaucine) can be used instead. This is probably important
for 3D printed trays where it may be time-consuming or costly to produce.



For the oxygen experiment, hydrogen peroxide
is a relatively strong
oxidizing agent and should be handled in small amount if possible.
Likewise, if gas tanks are available, transfer of gas via a small
rubber balloon can minimize the amount of gas that students will handle.
Rubber balloons of gas should be freshly prepared before the experiment
for a better result and for a safety reason.

If students rely
on time recorded by their digital camera rather
than a stopwatch, they should ensure to set the time properly. It
is also advisable to bring spare battery/camera and/or fully charge
their device beforehand. Ideally, the camera should be able to take
about 50 photos and can be in stand-by mode for at least 30 min.

Conclusions
and Implications
Experimental setup and detailed results
can be found in the Supporting Information. These experiments are
simple and inexpensive but provide invaluable experience for students
to conduct an inquiry-based laboratory. Modern instrumentation such
as oxygen probe, photography and videography equipment, and 3D printing,
if available, can also provide additional depth to the student’s
investigation. Possible discussion topics from science to art have
been extensively described elsewhere.2−5 Apart from laboratory practice, this experiment
can be a contest in a similar manner to crystal growing competitions.16
