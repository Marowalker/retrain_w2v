Water
participates actively in a wide range of interfacial adsorption
and reaction processes, and its structure, dynamics, and stability,
all of which are crucial to these processes, have been addressed in
the present study by means of molecular dynamics simulations. The
structure and dynamic behaviors of interfacial water are distinct
from those of bulk water and rely strongly on the amounts of surface
charges in clay minerals; for example, H-bonds exist predominately
among the interfacial water molecules for zero and low surface charges,
whereas prevail between the water molecules and clay surfaces for
high surface charges. Stabilities of the interfacial water molecules
oscillate remarkably during an increase of surface charges that first
decline and then are pronouncedly enhanced. Surface charges play a
critical role during the interfacial clay/water interaction, and the
interfacial water molecules are “liquid-like” at zero
and low surface charges but “ice-like” at high surface
charges. The present results greatly promote our understanding of
clays/water interfaces that exist ubiquitously in environmental conditions.

Introduction
Water is the most common solvent and participates
actively in all
types of biological, chemical, and geological processes while people
are gradually recognizing it as the most anomalous liquid.1 The situation becomes more complex when forming
the water/air and water/solid interfaces. A large number of systems
such as proteins, DNA, metal oxides, and clay minerals usually carry
an abundance of surface charges, and water molecules over these charged
surfaces behave distinctly from their bulk counterparts.2 Surface charges drive the favorable interactions
with water molecules,3,4 and the interfacial structures
control the subsequent adsorption and reaction processes; however,
our knowledge about interfacial water remains very limited.

Recently, Velasco-Velez et al.5 used
X-ray absorption spectroscopy and confirmed that the interfacial water
over gold electrolytes has a different structure from bulk water.
Although with a great deal of experimental efforts, understanding
of interfacial water is currently far from clear because the solid/water
interfaces are so complicated that direct spectral characterization
represents a challenge.2 Instead, computer
simulations can provide molecular-level information about the structure
and dynamics of the interfacial water that is otherwise almost inaccessible.6 Muscovite mica attracts substantial interest
in ecological science as the replacement of AgI in cloud seeding7 and plays a key role in a variety of geological
processes such as absorption of nutrients, storage of carbon dioxide,
and disposal of nuclear wastes.8 In addition,
the mica/water interfaces have been used widely as a prototype in
chemistry, biology, and physics3,9−14 because it is very facile to prepare flat mica surfaces at the atomic
scale. The first-principles molecular dynamics (MD) calculations (simulation
cell with 84 atoms and simulation time of 0.6 ps) showed that the
first-layer water molecules condense into a fully connected two-dimensional
H-bonding network and the comprising H atoms are oriented preferentially
toward the mica surface,10 suggesting the
formation of interfacial “ice-like” water films. It
is consistent with the results of vibrational sum frequency generation
spectroscopy manifesting that no dangling OH groups can be detected
at the full monolayer water coverage.15 On the other hand, Bergman and Swenson16 insisted that the interfacial water molecules are disordered and
should be ascribed to be “liquid-like”, which was supported
by classical molecular dynamics simulations showing high fluidity
for the water layers adjacent to the mica surface.11 Despite the controversies, consensus has been reached that
the first layer water molecules form strong H-bonds with the mica
surface.10−16 To resolve the controversies, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
of the mica/water interfaces were conducted in this study, and it
was found that the structure, dynamics, and stability of the interfacial
water rely strongly on the amount of surface charges. At zero and
low surface charges, H-bonds are constructed among the interfacial
water molecules, whereas an increase of surface charges causes a gradual
transformation, and, at high surface charges, strong H-bonds prevail
between the interfacial water molecules and clay surfaces. Surface
charges play a critical role during the interfacial clay/water interaction,
and the interfacial water molecules over clay minerals are liquid-like
at low surface charges but ice-like at high surface charges.

Computational
Section
Models of mica consist of 64 unit cells with the
lateral dimensions
of 41.59 Å × 36.10 Å (8 × 4 unit cells), in line
with the previous study.14 The vacuum slab
with the thickness of 10.0 nm was filled by 4933 water molecules (density
= 1.0 g·cm–3). A wide range of surface charges
(Γ = 0, 0.04, 0.08, 0.16, and 0.32 C·m–2) were, respectively, generated by Al3+/Si4+ substitutions obeying the Loewenstein rule and then balanced by
the interlayer K+ ions. Noting that when Γ = 0 C·m–2, the mica surface is composed solely of Si4+ sites. Comparisons among the various surface charges (Γ =
0–0.32 C·m–2) can discern the differences
of interfacial water molecules at Si4+ sites and Al3+ sites and derive the trends of interfacial water properties
with increase of surface charges.

The CLAYFF force field was
developed especially for mica and other
clay minerals,17 and its combination with
flexible simple point charge water model18,19 has been verified sufficiently to describe the interfacial interactions
between clay minerals and water.13,14,19−23 Gromacs 4.6.5 software24 was used. The
Ewald electrostatic summation and van der Waals interactions were
defined with the cutoff radii of 12.0 Å, and the long-range electrostatic
interactions were handled by the particle-mesh-Ewald method. The V-rescale
thermostat and Parrinello–Rahman barostat were used to control
the simulation temperature (300.0 K) and pressure (1.0 bar). Twenty
nanosecond MD simulations were run for each system, and the Newton’s
equations of motion were resolved using the leapfrog algorithm with
a 2.0 fs time step. The three-dimensional diffusion coefficients (D) of water molecules were calculated using the Einstein
relation23,25,26  where r(τ)2 refers to the mean-square displacement
of the center of mass for
water molecules over a time interval (τ).

Results and Discussion
Orientation
of Interfacial Water
The density profiles
of water oxygen (OW) and hydrogen (HW) atoms
have been plotted as a function of distances from the mica surface
(Figures 1 and 2). The interfacial water layers are strongly affected
by the mica surface, and increase of surface charges greatly enhances
the interaction between the water molecules and the mica surface,
resulting in significant reduction of distances. According to the
OW density profiles, the first layer water falls at 0.284,
0.271, 0.259, 0.252, and 0.246 nm away from the mica surface for Γ
= 0, 0.04, 0.08, 0.16, and 0.32 C·m–2, respectively.
In addition, when the surface charge density increases up to 0.08
C·m–2, a shoulder peak emerges at around 0.185
nm, and this shoulder peak becomes more significant with further increase
of surface charges. Consequently, increase of surface charges causes
a larger portion of water molecules to reorient at the interface,
and, at Γ = 0.32 C·m–2, the ratio of
water molecules at 0.185 vs 0.246 nm is as large as 34.5%, suggesting
the formation of the compact interfacial water layers at higher surface
charges.10,15 Perturbation of water molecules by surface
charges decays rapidly with the distances away from the mica surface,
and the OW density profiles of the fourth layer water are
similar for all surface charges (Γ = 0–0.32 C·m–2).

(OH) atoms of water to interact with mica surface.

It is indicated from the results
of density profiles that surface
charges may cause the reorientation of interfacial water molecules,27 as corroborated by the analyses of cos Ψ
(Figure 3). Note that
ψ stands for the angle between the opposite vector of water
dipole and the normal vector of the mica surface. In bulk water, cos Ψ
is averaged at 0.28 When interacting with
the electroneutral mica surface (Γ = 0 C·m–2), cos Ψ of the first layer water becomes slightly positive29 and it implies that the interfacial water molecules
prefer to form H-bonds among themselves rather than with the mica
surface. Introduction of surface charges causes cos Ψ
to be negative, and cos Ψ becomes more negative with
further increase of surface charges, suggesting that higher surface
charges correspond to the larger extent of water reorientation. The
more negative cos Ψ manifests a higher tendency for both
H atoms in water to point toward the mica surface, and at, Γ
= 0.32 C·m–2, cos Ψ can amount
to −0.87, where a considerable portion of interfacial water
molecules use both H atoms to form H-bonds with the mica surface (Figure 4E). The results are
consistent with those of HW density profiles (Figure 2B). With no surface
charges (Γ = 0 C·m–2), the first peak
of HW is centered at 0.296 nm, and its abundance reduces
substantially (1.00:0.76 for 0:0.32 C·m–2)
due to the introduction of surface charges, although only slight alteration
is caused to its position. In addition, introduction of surface charges
produces a noticeable peak at a distance very close to the mica surface
(around 0.161 nm) because water reorientation greatly facilitates
the formation of H-bonds with the mica surface.

Transformation of H-Bonding
Networks
With no surface
charges (Γ = 0 C·m–2), the tetrahedral
surface of mica is composed solely of Si4+ sites and the
first layer water molecules are inclined to construct H-bonds among
themselves. Silica and undoped zeolites that contain only the siloxane
(≡Si–O–Si≡) linkages are known to be hydrophobic.29,30 The tetrahedral surface of the electroneutral mica (Γ = 0
C·m–2) is also comprised of siloxane linkages
and hence assumed to be hydrophobic, as testified by the positive
cos Ψ. Hydrophobic surfaces repel water, whereas hydrophilic
surfaces attract water. The positive cos Ψ values indicate
that a majority of H atoms of the first layer water molecules point
away from the mica surface and accordingly the mica surface of the
electroneutral mica (Γ = 0 C·m–2) is
hydrophobic. The H-bonding networks are well structured (Figure 4A), resulting in
the small standard deviations for Ψ values (σ = 0.67).
Introduction of surface charges disrupts the H-bonding networks among
water molecules and causes the first layer water to reorient toward
the mica surface (Figure 4B,C). Accordingly, the standard deviations for Ψ(σ)
become significantly larger, amounting to 5.15 and 4.63 for Γ
= 0.04 and 0.08 C·m–2. The sign of cos Ψ
turns to be negative, and it implies that the mica surface is getting
hydrophilic. However, the regulation of hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties
is local and takes place mainly at substituted sites, consistent with
the observations that a majority of the first layer water molecules
still form H-bonds among themselves. It suggests that for no and low
surface charges, the first layer water molecules are liquid-like rather
than ice-like.11,16 The continuing increase of surface
charges causes an obviously larger portion of water molecules to further
rotate and approach the mica surface. For Γ = 0.16 C·m–2, the second H atoms of the first layer water molecules
(referred to as H2, see Figure 4D) begin to contact with the mica surface,
and Figure 2B indicates
that an obviously larger portion of H atoms in the first layer water
molecules emerges at around 0.161 nm than for Γ = 0.04, 0.08
C·m–2, in line with the results of cos Ψ
and σ. Meanwhile, a reversal of standard deviations for Ψ(σ)
has been detected, and the σ values for Γ = 0.16 and 0.32
C·m–2 are lower than those for Γ = 0.08
C·m–2 and amount to 1.01 and 0.43, respectively.
The very negative cos Ψ and low σ values for Γ
= 0.32 C·m–2 manifest that a majority of the
first layer water molecules use two H atoms to form H-bonds with the
surface-O atoms (Figure 4E), where the interfacial water should be ascribed a ice-like structure.10,15 The H-bonds are stronger than those at the hydrophilic Mg(OH)2 surface;31 hence, alteration of
surface charges can regulate the hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties
of the mica surface in a wide range, from hydrophobic to highly hydrophilic.
The results are further supported by the HW density profiles
(Figure 2B). The abundances
of H atoms corresponding to the peak at around 0.161 nm are pronouncedly
enlarged with increase of surface charges, and the ratios for 0.04:0.08:0.16:0.32
C·m–2 are 0.29:0.35:0.75:1.00. Consequently,
increase of surface charges causes more H atoms of the first layer
water molecules to point toward the mica surface and the higher extent
of reorientation for the first layer water molecules (see Figure 4) (Γ = 0–0.32
C·m–2). At Γ = 0.32 C·m–2, a large portion of the first layer water molecules use two H atoms
to construct H-bonds with the mica surface and the H-bond networks
between the interfacial water molecules and the mica surface have
been constructed, different from the situation of Γ = 0 C·m–2 where the H-bond networks exist mainly among the
interfacial water molecules.

Stability Oscillation of Interfacial Water
The diffusion
coefficients of water layers (D) in vicinity of the
mica surface are plotted in Figure 5. With no surface charges (Γ = 0 C·m–2), the diffusion coefficients (D)
of the first, second, third, and fourth layer water are, respectively,
3.08 ± 0.20 × 10–9, 3.41 ± 0.40 ×
10–9, 3.31 ± 0.26 × 10–9, and 3.21 ± 0.26 × 10–9 m2·s–1, which are less than the value of bulk
water (4.02 × 10–9 m2·s–1)32,33 and manifest the stabilization
effects of the mica surface to the interfacial water molecules. In
spite of its hydrophobic nature, the mica surface exhibits the stabilization
effects to the first layer water molecules. The D values of the first layer water increase to 3.17 ± 0.28 ×
10–9 and 4.04 ± 0.22 × 10–9 m2·s–1, respectively, for Γ
= 0.04 and 0.08 C·m–2. Accordingly, stabilities
of the first layer water decline due to the introduction of surface
charges and confirm the liquid-like characteristics at low surface
charges.11,16 At low surface charges, stabilities of the
first layer water molecules rely strongly on the H-bonding networks
among themselves, and Γ = 0.08 C·m–2 rather
than Γ = 0.04 C·m–2 causes a larger perturbation
to the H-bonding networks among the interfacial water molecules that
result in the more significant loss of stabilities. The D values of the first layer water molecules are calculated to be 3.28
± 0.02 × 10–9 and 2.28 ± 0.28 ×
10–9 m2·s–1, respectively,
for Γ = 0.16 and 0.32 C·m–2, which are
less than those of Γ = 0.08 C·m–2 and
imply the reversal for the trend of stabilities with further elevation
of surface charges. As mentioned above, increase of surface charges
causes the transformation of H-bonding networks from among water molecules
to between water molecules and the mica surface. When compared to
Γ = 0.08 C·m–2, stabilities of the first
layer water molecules have been substantially improved for Γ
= 0.16 C·m–2 but are still lower than those
for Γ = 0 C·m–2, corroborating that the
H-bonding transformation from among water molecules to between water
molecules and the mica surface is not beneficial to the stability
of interfacial water molecules. When surface charges increase up to
0.32 C·m–2, the H-bonding transformation has
finished and the H-bonds between water molecules and the mica surface
predominate. The ordered array of the first layer water results in
the superior stabilities and verifies the formation of ice-like water.10,15

Conclusions
In
this work, we have shown that the structure, dynamics, and stability
of water molecules at the mica/water interfaces are distinct from
those of bulk water and rely strongly on the surface charges in clay
minerals. For example, the H-bonding networks are reconstructed during
the gradual increase of surface charges and transformed from among
water molecules to between water molecules and clay surfaces. Surface
charges play a critical role during the interfacial clay/water interaction.
As compared to the condition of zero surface charges, the interfacial
water molecules over clay surfaces exhibit decreased stability and
are liquid-like at low surface charges but show pronounced stability
enhancement and are ice-like at high surface charges, thus reconciling
the previous controversies.
