A simple
one-step chemical
method is employed for the successful synthesis of CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)
nanocomposites (NCs) and investigation of their gas sensing properties.
The X-ray diffraction studies revealed that these CuO–ZnO NCs
display a hexagonal wurtzite-type crystal structure. The average width
of 50–100 nm and length of 200–600 nm of the NCs were
confirmed by transmission electron microscopic images, and the 1:1
proportion of Cu and Zn composition was confirmed by energy-dispersive
spectra, i.e., CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NC studies. The CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)
NCs exhibit superior gas sensing performance with outstanding selectivity
toward NO2 gas at a working temperature of 200 °C. Moreover, these
NCs were used for the indirect evaluation of NO2 via electrochemical
detection of NO2– (as NO2 converts
into NO2– once it reacts with moisture,
resulting into acid rain, i.e., indirect evaluation of NO2). As compared with other known modified electrodes, CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)
NCs show an apparent oxidation of NO2– with a larger peak current for a wider linear range of nitrite concentration
from 20 to 100 mM. We thus demonstrate that the as-synthesized CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)
NCs act as a promising low-cost NO2 sensor and further
confirm their potential toward tunable gas sensors (electrochemical
and solid state) (Scheme 1).

1 Introduction
NO2 is an omnipresent
species and has been closely associated
with the areas of environment and food as a corrosion inhibitor and
an additive. It is also an indispensable source in the generation
of nitrosamines, which is exceptionally robust carcinogenic to humanoid.1 Due to the toxicity of NO2, the ingestion
of these ions can cause serious impact on animal and human health.2 Acid rain results when nitrogen
oxides (NOx) and sulfur oxide (SOx) are released into the atmosphere and transported
by wind and air currents. NOx and SO2 react with oxygen, water, and other chemicals to form nitric
and sulfuric acids. Then, these chemically react with water and other
materials before falling to the ground. It has been stated that NO2 can destruct the nervous system, spleen, and kidneys and
has a solid correlation with high cancer levels, the ecological environment,
and public health causing defective births, blue baby disorder, abortion,
intrauterine growth control, and serious cancer risk,3 when its concentration is higher than 3 mg mL–1.4 Accordingly, the determination of NO2 becomes more crucial
in environmental protection and for public health due to its harmful
effects. Many techniques have been developed to determine NO2 levels, such as ion chromatography,5 spectrophotometry,6 high-performance liquid chromatography,7 gas chromatography–mass spectrometry,8 capillary electrophoresis,9 and electrochemical methods.10 However, most of these methods frequently require complicated and
high-cost instrumentation. Among them, considerable attention has
been given toward electrochemical methods because of their simple
operation, fast response, and outstanding selectivity. In recent years,
tunable electrochemical sensing based on various electrocatalytic
systems has attracted great attention because of its high sensitivity,
rapid and controlled response, and ease in operation.11 Furthermore, electrochemical sensors are especially more
suitable for detecting NO2 and further conversion in real
time. The reduction process of NO2 is quite complicated
and involves a sequence of in-between products.12 At present, a variety of electrocatalytic materials have
been reported for the construction of NO2 sensors, such
as carbon, metal/metal oxide nanostuctures, etc.13 Among the various electrocatalysts used for NO2 detection, transition metal oxides of nanomaterials based on Fe,
Sn, Co, Ni, and Mn have received excessive interest due to their lower
cost and stoichiometry, size- and shape-tunable electronic structures,
and their
correlation with properties.14

Semiconducting
metal-oxide-based nanostructural hybrid gas sensors are the most developed
sensor systems and have drawn considerable attention due to the increasing
concern of pollution and its effects on living systems. For example,
literature reflects development of several types of gas sensing technologies,
including optical detectors,15 electrochemical
detectors, and resistive gas sensor devices.16 However, considering the limitations,
developing an efficient gas sensor device with high response, selectivity,
and stability is highly desirable.17 The
contaminated atmosphere becomes harmful due to the increasing level
of toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide,
sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, acetone gas, and others.18 Among these existing toxic gases, the NO2 gas is one of the larger and most common noxious contaminants
emitted from different resources such as burning in automobile engines,
fertilizer industries, home heaters, furnaces, and power plants.19 Besides, NO2 is usually generated
from many custom chemical manufacturing processes and photochemical
smog, which is injurious to humans and animals.20 Even an extremely small quantity of NO2 gas
is highly poisonous to living systems and harmful to the atmosphere.21 Therefore, the growth of gas sensor systems
that can observe NO2 at an extremely low parts per million
(ppm) level is an urgent need and a
defy in the gas sensing research meadow. Recently, the series of semiconducting
metal oxides like TiO2, ZnO, and SnO2 have been
widely investigated to detect NO2 gas due to their high
response and selectivity with outstanding chemical stability.22

More interestingly, the idea of using
n-type and p-type semiconductors, as well as their mixtures, to develop
sensor concert
has been reported.23 For p-type and n-type
mixtures, mainly two strategies are used, and a combination of p-type
and n-type mixtures generates a diode-type junction.24 In that, a CuO–ZnO
hybrid support gas sensor system has been studied to identify some
reducing gases and vapors. For this, the poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP)-mediated
hydrothermal method has been used to prepare nanoscale p(CuO)–n(ZnO)
junctions, which display high response to H2S gas sensing.25 A mixture of p–n composite nanomaterials
has been synthesized for gas sensors such as NiO/SnO2,26 Co3O4/ZnO,27 NiO/WO3,28 CuO/ZnO,29 CuO/TiO2,30 NiO/ZnO,31a etc.
It reflects that a substrate with enough conductivity and chemical
stability is required to make certain the formation of valid p–n-type
junctions.

Here, CuO–ZnO nanocomposites (NCs) were prepared
via a single-step easy chemical synthesis method and their NO2 gas sensing properties were observed, which is one of the
works exploring the response with sensing time. In the synthesis method
to prepared 1:1 proportion of ZnO with CuO shows a comparatively low
sensing time and temperature. The response time lied within 6 s, for
5 ppm NO2 gas concentration. However, the recovery time
was relatively short. Thus, a method with a superior gas response,
a relatively lower working operating temperature, and a shorter response
time could be attained by CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NC flakelike
architecture. Compared to separate gas sensing result reported31 in CuO and ZnO were not too good so we have
synthesized CuO–ZnO NCs for gas sensing applications because
these composites are short band gap, easily prepared by a one-step
synthesis method, and are nontoxic, environmentally friendly, abundant
in nature, and cost-effective.31

The current study shows a facile chemical method, which was effectively
used for the synthesis of CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NCs having low
cost and straight approach of depositing dissimilar kinds of metals
directly into a composite form
(Scheme 1). The arrangement
and morphology of as-synthesized NCs were studied by diverse characterization
techniques, and their gas sensing properties were analytically investigated
at different working temperatures from 100 to 250 °C using NO2, SO2, H2S, CO, MeOH, and Cl2 gases, respectively. The studies herein propose that the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)
NCs are extremely selective and sensitive toward NO2 gas
as compared to other gases. Other gas sensor parameters such as temperature
needy response,
reproducibility, selectivity, response/recovery, and immovability
of CuO–ZnO NCs were also systematically studied and investigated.
In the present work, we observed nanoflakes of CuO–ZnO, which
are hitherto unattempted (a new morphology of this composite). These
flakes can more easily adsorb to NO2 gas molecules, resulting
in better performance with excellent stability. The as-obtained CuO–ZnO
NCs had a permeable configuration with relatively high precise surface
region. It was create that
the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) nanoflaxes inborn the morphology of originator
while frequent pores were formed later than the annealing. So extend
the
gas sensing concert of this morphology. Yang et al. studied the CuO–ZnO
heterostructure for NO2 gas sensing at 350 °C working
temperature.31 Jin and co-workers studied
CuO–ZnO NCs for NO2 gas sensing at a working temperature
of 300 °C.31 Novelty of our material
is, as per previous report solid state gas sensing result is 100 ppm
exposing NO2 gas sensing at 200 °C for 73% response
as compare to better above reported NO2 sensing result
as well as shown excellent in room temperature (RT) electrochemical
sensing at high current density and lower detection limit of nitrate
sensing.

2 Result and
Discussion
2.1 Structural
and Compositional Revelation
X-ray diffraction (XRD) shown
in Figure 1a demonstrates
the characteristic peaks of CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NCs, the peaks
at 2θ values corresponding to the crystal planes of 110, 002,
101, 102, 110, 103, 200, 112, 021, 201, 004, and 202. The 2θ
value
indices of the nanocomposite were observed as for 31, 34, 35, 36,
38, 47, 48, 56, 58, 61, 62, 66, and 68°, respectively. The bar
which is
indicated in the Miller indices had shown the negative direction of
the plane, which is in good accordance with earlier information on
a like system.32 The XRD peaks are in superior
conformity with the reported diffraction pattern of CuO with a monoclinic
structure (JCPDS card # 00-041-0254). Similarly, diffraction peaks
for ZnO having a hexagonal structure match well with the reported
XRD pattern (JCPDS card # 01-079-0206). Figure 1b shows the energy-dispersive X-ray analysis
(EDAX) results, confirming that O, Cu, and Zn are present in prepared
CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NCs. Both the XRD and EDAX evidence the successful
synthesis of CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%).

NCs confirms the monoclinic and hexagonal structure formation. (b)

microscopy (TEM) image of CuO–ZnO NC-based flakes having large-scale
distribution and (d) TEM image of a single flake of CuO–ZnO
NCs having dimensions 50–100 nm.

The morphological studies
of CuO–ZnO NCs were carried out by TEM analysis. The large-scale
homogeneous features of NCs are shown in Figure 1c (low magnification) and Figure 1d (high magnification). The
CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NCs consisting of the characteristic flakelike
NCs of width about 50–100 nm and length of
a few micrometers are in good agreement with earlier reports.33 TEM images show that the surface of ZnO is covered
by CuO nanoparticles (NPs). Also, the exposed ZnO flakes are shown
in the TEM image (Figure 1c).

The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) profile is
shown in Figure 2a.
CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NCs reveal thermal stability, and to investigate
the amount of PVP present, TGA
shows the three major steps observed for weight losses of the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)
NCs. In the first stage, weight losses (M1) of 0.66% for CuO–ZnO occur in the range of 22–108
°C, and the process starts with the loss of bound water. The
second step of weight loss takes place from 108 to 233 °C corresponding
to the mass loss (M2) of 1.29% for CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)
NCs, which is related to the decomposition of PVP (structure-directing
agent). At higher temperatures however, additional decomposition steps
take place.33 The third step of weight
loss (M3) taking place from 233 to 376
°C indicates the weight loss of 1.79% for CuO–ZnO, which
is attributed to the complete conversion to the crystalline form. Figure 2b shows typical N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)
NCs. To calculate the porosity of the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NCs,
we have recorded N2 adsorption–desorption curves
of the dehydrated material at a relative pressure of 0–1 bar
at 77 K. The amount of N2 absorbed on the metal oxide is
found to be ∼135 cm3 g–1 on P/P0 of 0.98, and this could
be due to the porous structure of CuO–ZnO, which is probably
developed due to the nanodimensions. The isotherm appears to be of
nearly type IV in nature, characteristic for solids containing both
micro- and mesopores.34 The specific surface
area using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis, average
pore radius, and total pore volume were calculated to be 67.6 m2 g–1, 6.1 nm, and 0.206 cc g–1, respectively. The UV–visible spectra of CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)
NC samples were recorded. CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NCs exhibit a UV
band at 3.17 eV, whereas CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NCs show a UV spectral
band with significant assimilation in the visible region. The accredited
arrangement of extra defects at the interface of CuO with ZnO is of
specific significance for the gas sensing purpose [Supporting Information (SI)].

Figure 2 (a) Representative TGA
curve shows the different weight
losses as a consequence of volatile contamination, moisture, and PVP
molecules bound on the surface; (b) N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherm for CuO–ZnO NCs.

Chemical states and surface
compositions of Cu and Zn present in the nanomaterials were examined
by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey of the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)
NCs as shown in Figure 3a. The outcome shows the presence of the elements like O, Zn, C,
and Cu in the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NCs. The peak at 285.35 eV
is attributed to the carbon that lingers in small quantities after
blazing exposed the PVP at 500 °C. The CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)
NCs
are shown in Figure 3b. The Zn 2p peaks centered at 1022.7 and 1045.8 eV (ZnO) are assigned
to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively. These
peaks are the
same as those of Zn2+ in hexagonal wurtzite ZnO.35 The Zn 2p peaks are seen to be shifted to slightly
higher binding energies for the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NC material
of 1021.96 eV (Zn 2p3/2) and 1045.04 eV (Zn 2p1/2). The O 1s peak shows
high resolutions (Figure 3c) of several partly cover mechanism. The peak fitted with
characteristic Gaussian functions and determined to peaks (1), (2),
and (3) with binding energies of 529.9, 530.50, and 531.62 eV for
ZnO NCs, correspondingly. Peak (2) may be correlated to O2– ions in the lattice. Peak (1) may be attributed
to the O2– ions adsorbed on the surface of films,
whereas peak (3) may be attributed to the O22–, O–, and OH– ions in oxygen-lacking
regions. In the case of the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NCs, the O 1s
peaks (1)–(3) are observed to be shifted to somewhat higher
binding energies of 529.9, 530.50, and 531.62 eV, respectively.35 The Zn 2p peaks seen at 1021.96 eV (Zn 2p3/2) and 1045.04 eV (Zn 2p1/2) binding energies
move to faintly superior energies in the composite CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)
sample.

spectra of CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)
NCs. (b–d) Deconvolution of Zn, O, and Cu peaks, respectively.

In brief, the shift to higher binding energies of Zn
2p in the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NC sample can be attributed generally
to the interaction between CuO and ZnO nanomaterials, while that of
O 1s obviously is attributed to changes in the O2 environment
at the surface owing to CuO glaze. Change in the surface O2 species in the samples was also confirmed by calculating the ratio
of the areas under the curves of [peak (1) + peak (3)] and peak (2).
The ratio is 0.76 for the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NC samples, representing
an increase in the quantity of engrossed O2 species in
the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NCs. On the other hand, this addition
is not the main cause for the development in NO2 gas sensing
recital, converse
below. The Cu 2p spectra show a high-resolution peak in Figure 3d. The peak at 934.65 eV is
attributed to Cu 2p3/2, while the peak at 954.76 eV is
attributed to Cu 2p1/2, demonstrating the existence of
CuO nanoparticles among the +2 oxidation state of Cu. In addition,
the peaks of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 were experimental
peaks 954.11 eV (S1) and 963.23 eV (S2), correspondingly,
attributed to a moderately full d-orbital (3d9 in the case
of Cu2+). The XPS and XRD results sturdily support the
arrangement of CuO with
Cu(II) on the ZnO surface.35

2.2 Gas Sensing Studies
The
selectivity study of the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NC sensor was carried
out on hazardous gases H2S, NO2, CO, SO2, CH3OH, and Cl2 each at a concentration
of 100 ppm, and the observed results are shown in Figure 4a. The selectivity study clearly
indicates that the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NC sensor is more reactive
toward the NO2 gas than to the other gases, viz., H2S, CO, SO2, CH3OH, and Cl2. Such a higher response (73%) observed
for NO2 strength to the higher rate of interface take place
NC sensor surface area and NO2 gas molecules as evaluate
to additional tested gases (Figure 4a). All gas sensing response
curves for analyte selectivity are shown in detail in the Supporting Information. The highest response
of the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NC sensor to NO2 is confirmed
by calculating the selectivity coefficient (K). The
selectivity coefficient (K) of NO2 gas
with respect to other gases is projected using the following equation,
and obtained values are listed in Table 1(36) 1  Here, SA represents the sensor responses (Rg/Ra) to NO2 gas
and SB represents the sensor response
to other test gases. The superior K value for a selective
gas of the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NC sensor shows enhanced ability
to find out the objective gas from the other test gases.36

The working temperature is measured since
it is a vital feature during the gas sensing study, which influences
the adsorption/desorption procedure of oxygen ions on the top of the
sensor outer surface. Surface metal-oxide-based sensors adsorb oxygen
from air and form O2–, O2–, and O– species.37 The
surface negative charges produce a superior surface potential barrier,
which results in a high electrical resistance.38 The sensor oxidizes NOx gas,
and the NOx gas molecules exert a pull
on the electrons from sensor nanomaterials, which can be renowned
to their towering electron attraction.39 These processes lead to the transfer of electrons from the sensor
materials to the surface of NOx, forming
the species NO2– (from NO2) and NO– (from NO). The process takes electrons
from the conduction band or the donor level of the material, which
results in reduction in the electron bulkiness, thereby increasing
the hole transporter density at the surface of the sensor. The increased
concentration of the hole carriers results in lowering of the resistance
of the semiconductor film. In addition, it results in a thinner space
charge layer and consequently reduction in the potential barricade
at the grain restrictions, causing reduction in the resistance of
the sensor.39 The scheme can be expressed
as follows 2   3   4  Frequently,
the response of metal oxide [CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)]-based gas sensors
is quite high in the temperature range 100–250 °C, in
which oxygen has O– nature. The optimization of
working temperature for the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NC gas sensor
(predetermined 100 ppm NO2 gas) is shown in Figure 4b. The CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)
NC gas sensor shows a maximum response rate of 73% at an operating
temperature of 200 °C in the presence of 100 ppm NO2 gas (Figure 4b).
Herein, the response (Rg/Ra) of CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NC sensing is smaller at
lower working temperatures (less than 200 °C) owing to the small
rate of reactions, which might be owing to the inferior rate of dispersal
of gas molecules. Although the speed of
these reactions becomes corresponding on mediator 200 °C, since
the result of CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NC sensor achieved its highest
response rate. Consequently, an additional study is carried out at
200 °C as an optimized sensor temperature. See the gas sensing
response curve at all temperatures (100–250 °C) in the Supporting Information (SI).

The dynamic
response (Rg/Ra) curve of the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NC sensor toward a range
of concentrations (5–100 ppm) of targeted NO2 gas
at 200 °C is revealed in Figure 4c, which displays the response of sensor (designed
with eq 5) established
to be rising with the concentration of NO2. The response
arc of the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NC sensor toward 5 ppm NO2 is shown in Figure 4c. The highest response (Rg/Ra) of 73% to 100 ppm NO2 along with
∼8% to 5 ppm NO2 at a working temperature of 200
°C is detected. At inferior concentrations, NO2 gas
molecules cover a smaller surface of the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)
NC sensor and, as a consequence, lessen the surface acquaintances,
consequently leading to a smaller response value. Besides, at high
concentration, NO2 covers a larger CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)
NC surface, resulting in a higher response (Rg/Ra) value due to the greater
surface interactions; at various NO2 gas concentrations
of 5–100 ppm, the response percent is shown in the calibration
curve (Supporting Information). The design
of variation in response
and renewal times as a role of diverse NO2 gas concentration
ranging from 5 toward 100 ppm on 200 °C be given in Figure 4d. Response and renewal
times are significant parameters in analyzing a gas sensor. Response
and renewal times and recovery time are the times to achieve a 90%
resistance change when the gas is injected into the chamber. They
mainly depend on the quickness of adsorption and desorption, respectively.

The response time of the CuO–ZnO thin film to NO2 gas as a function of the NO2 gas concentration is shown
in Figure 4d. It shows
the recovery time of the CuO thin film to NO2 gas as a
function of the NO2 gas loading. In this study, the response
time and recovery time are defined as the times to achieve a 90% change
in resistance upon exposure to NO2 and air, respectively.
Regarding the effect of the working temperature on the sensing speed
of the CuO–ZnO film, the fastest response and recovery were
observed at 200 °C. In addition, the sensor showed the shortest
sensing time (sum of the response time and recovery time) at 200 °C.
However, the response and recovery times showed little dependence
on the NO2 concentration. The dependence of the response
time and recovery time of the sensors on the working temperature could
also be explained in a similar manner to the response transients.
Different oxygen ion species form at different temperatures after
the adsorption of oxygen molecules at the sensor surfaces, and the
reaction rate of NO2 with O– at 200 °C
might be stronger than that of O2– at
100 °C or O2– at 300 °C, leading to the
fastest sensing at 200 °C. As shown in the figure, the CuO–ZnO
thin films synthesized in this study showed shorter sensing time toward
NO2.39

Response and recovery
profiles (Figure 4d)
show that the response time and recovery time differ inversely from
all others with respect to different concentrations of NO2 gas. The response time of the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NC sensor
is set up to be decreasing from 13 to 5 s, while the renewal time
increases from 60 to 280 s with increasing NO2 gas concentration
from 5 to 100 ppm. Such a falling in response time on increasing NO2 gas concentration may be owing to big accessibility of available
sites on the sensor surface for gas adsorption. However, the increase
in recovery time may be caused by gas type which
is left following later than the gas communication in the decrease
in desorption speed and therefore recovery time increase as NO2 gas concentration also increases.40

The gas response (Rg/Ra) in expression of change in electrical resistance values
of CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NCs to 100 ppm NO2 gas sensor
is shown in Figure 5a. The gas response reproducibility and reversibility are mainly
considered as crucial factors of sensors, and the uniformity of the
sensor is chiefly reliant on such parameters. Reproducibility and
reversibility tests of the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NC sensor are
shown in Figure 5b,c,
respectively. Figure 5c indicates the response (Rg/Ra) reversibility of the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)
NC sensor toward 40, 80, and 60 ppm NO2 gas concentration.
The stability response of the CuO–ZnO NC sensor is shown to
be decreased from 73 to 54% (after 20 days) with 73% constancy (Supporting Information).

CuO–ZnO NC sensor.

2.3 NO2 Gas Sensing Mechanism
Experimentally, it is observed that when oxidizing NO2 gas is exposed to the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NC sensor, it shows
rapid reduction in the resistance (Rg/Ra), which indicates the p-type activities of
CuO, and therefore charge transport basically occurs during CuO.
This modification in the resistance values is owing to the adsorption
of the gas molecules on the surface of the NC layer. When NO2 gas molecules
cooperate with the p electron network of CuO have set ZnO nanoparticles
capture from CuO sequence results in reduce the resistance. The preliminary
resistance is noticed when NO2 gas is turned off and new
air is introduced into the cavity. This can be made clear on the basis
of planned schematic energy band diagram shown in Scheme 2a–c. For drawing the
energy band diagram, the experimentally calculated values of the band
gap energies have been used. Scheme 2a shows the energy band diagram of individual CuO and
ZnO, representing that the Fermi level (EF) of p-type CuO is close to the valence band (Ev), whereas in n-ZnO, the Fermi level is close to the conduction
band (Ec). Accordingly, all sensing measurements
of CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NCs show high sensor response (Rg/Ra), and this
enhancement in the response can be due to the interfacial depletion
layer of p–n-type CuO–ZnO NCs connecting the surface
of CuO and ZnO nanoparticles. Fascinatingly, the adsorption of ionized
oxygen at surfaces of the ZnO–CuO NCs controls the flow of
electron (Scheme 2b).
The revealing of CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NCs
to NO2 gas sensor will reason the captured electrons to
free into the fabric. These free electrons use the holes in CuO and
also lead to excess electrons in ZnO, resulting into decrease in the
width of the depletion film. Due to the survival of p–n hybrid
CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NCs, the consumed holes in CuO would supplement
rapidly from the electron depletion film at the interface of NCs.
Through this electron transfer process, the holes in the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)
NCs migrate to CuO across the heterocontact interface and the electrons
move into their interfacial conduction band, which in turn increase
the charge carrier concentration as well as decrease its resistivity.41

Mechanism of NO2 Gas Sensing in the Band Gap
The n-type ZnO NPs form a CuO barrier
layer with the matrix, leading to the formation of the depletion layer
and is schematically shown in Scheme 2. Interestingly, the surface NO2 gas molecules
when come in contact with CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NCs affect the
width and decrease the depletion layer, which results in a further
decrease in the resistance, which is schematically shown in Scheme 2c. Furthermore, they
increase the conductivity of the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NC-based
sensor material. The space charge region in CuO decreases the adsorption
of NO2 gas species (by reduction of electrons), which further
produces high conductivity. Therefore, the inflection of the space
charge region at the boundary of CuO with ZnO NPs gives better response
toward the NO2 gas sensor. The enhanced performance of
CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NCs is attributed to their unique p–n-type
heterostructure. In Scheme 2c, a p–n heterojunction is formed, and also, the energy
band bends with the depletion layer to form a uniform Fermi level
(EF) in the thermal equilibrium state
(Scheme 2c).

The construction of n–p-type composites between n-type ZnO
and p-type CuO, where electrons move from n-type ZnO to p-type CuO
while the holes transfer conversely from CuO to ZnO until the system
obtains equalization at the Fermi level, results in the formation
of a hole depletion layer that promotes the quantity of the chemisorbed
oxygen species.42Scheme 2d shows the systematic representation of
the electron–hole transfer mechanism, and it can be calculated
that the barrier heights of the conduction band [ΔEc = Ec2 – Ec1] and the valence band [ΔEv = (Eg2 – Eg1) – ΔEc] at the p–n junction are 0.75 and 0.72
eV, respectively.42Table 1 shows the performance of the as-prepared
CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NCs and some reported metal-oxide-based nanocomposites
of NO2 gas sensors from the literature (see in the Supporting Information).

2.4 Electrochemical Sensing of Nitrate by CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)-Based
Electrodes
Electrochemical measurements were performed on
CHI-660E by modified glassy carbon (GC) with CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)
NCs, and Pt foil and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) are counter
and reference electrodes, correspondingly. As shown in Figure 6a, the overlay linear sweep
voltammetry (LSV) response for GC (i), CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)/GC
NPs (ii) in 0.5 M KOH solution and the LSV for CuO–ZnO/GC NPs,
(iii) 30 mM NO2– in 0.5 M KOH at scan
rate of 50 mV s–1 to connect
the potential range of surface CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) oxidation
and NO2– oxidation reactions. The superimposed
LSV in 0.5 M KOH for GC (i) and GC–ZnO (ii) NP electrodes reflects
that there is no any peak in the absence of NO2–, though a new important oxidation peak is obtained at +0.80 V versus
rotating cylinder electrode in the presence of 30 mM NO2– corresponding to electrocatalytic oxidation of
NO2– to NO3– with comparable
report systems.43 Furthermore, no representative
anodic peak is initiated in the anodic sweep on GC in the presence
of NO2– ions, which reflects its inability
toward oxidation of NO2–. These observations
demonstrate significantly the electrochemical ability of CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)
NCs toward NO2 determination, which also further provides
an indirect link for NO2– oxidation in
an aqueous system. Further, the influence of the increase in concentration
of NO2– on the electrocatalytic oxidation
potential and peak current of the CuO–ZnO NP electrode in 0.5
M KOH is also demonstrated. In Figure 6b, the oxidation potential and peak current at an onset
potential of 0.80 V versus SCE demonstrate a linear response with
an increase in NO2– ion concentration
in the range of 20–50 mM; moreover, this linear range is broader
than that of the reported method.44 Also,
the influence of the scan rate on the electrocatalytic oxidation peak
potential (Epa) and peak current for NO2– on the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)/glassy
carbon electrode (GCE) at 0.5 mM was studied using LSV. The Figure 6c current values
were found to be improved with an increase in scan rate starting from
10 to 100 mV s–1. The linear relationship connecting
the anodic peak currents with the square root of the scan rate in Figure 6d45 indicates that NO2– oxidation
is a diffusion-controlled reaction.

2.5 Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopic and Chronoamperometric
(Current Stability) Measurements
The electrocatalytic activities
of as-synthesized CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NCs were further studied
using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The EIS is used
to assess the charge transfer resistance of the materials. Figure 7a demonstrates the
Nyquist plots of as-synthesized CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NCs, and
the semicircle shows small diameter in the plot, indicating the minor
resistance at the electrified interface. As an outcome, the charge
transfer resistance (Rct) of NaNO2 at 30 mM is found to be ∼520 Ω.47 In general, among all of the customized electrocatalysts,
CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) has a minor Rct value, which indicates that the electron transfer kinetic reaction
rate in the presence of NaNO2 is extra rapid than in the
absence of NaNO2. The estimated Rct standards are 520 and 25 000 Ω, which result
due to the presence and absence of CuO–ZnO, respectively.

Figure 7 (a) Impedance spectra
(Nyquist plot) of synthesized CuO–ZnO NCs in 0.5 M KOH as well
as CuO–ZnO NPs, in 0.5 M KOH containing 30 mM L–1 NO2– solution. (b) Electrochemical
stability of CuO–ZnO NCs in 0.5 M KOH containing 30 mM L–1 NO2– for 8000 s.

As a result, the
fabricated CuO–ZnO of EIS observations is calculated since
a superior validation and shows small semicircle to improve the catalytic
activity of CuO–ZnO in presence of NaNO246 and CuO nanowall based Cu substrate based electrocatalytic
systems. The modified CuO–ZnO/GCE electrochemical sensor shows
a smaller semicircle in the Nyquist plot (Figure 7a), indicating that it exhibits excellent
electrochemical nitrate sensing property compared to CuO–ZnO/GCE
in 0.5 M KOH; without nitrate, the resistance of the electrochemically
modified sensor rapidly decreases in the presence of 30 mM NO2– ions in a 0.5 M KOH solution of electrolyte. Figure 7b shows immovability
curves of CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NCs toward a practical onset potential
of 0.6 V versus SCE for 8000 s in the solution containing 20 mM NaNO2 into 0.5 M KOH electrolytic solution. Here, the electrode
retains its initial response for 20 mM NaNO2. The current
decline is significantly slower in the entire experiment range,46 which demonstrates its outstanding survival
capacity toward NO2– to NO3– electrocatalytic oxidation. Table S2 relationship of investigative
recital of diverse electrochemical sensors used for nitrate (NO3–) discovers (see the Supporting Information).

3 Conclusions
We have successfully prepared
novel and stable CuO–ZnO NCs and characterized them using different
microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. Their gas sensing activities
were further studied toward various target gas molecules. On the basis
of the gas sensing study, it is discovered that the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)
NC sensor is proficient in detecting extremely low concentrations
(near about 5 ppm of NO2 gas) of NO2 gas at
a working temperature of 200 °C. Moreover, this NC-based sensing
system is capable through the quick response/recovery times, outstanding
repeatability, and stability in NO2 response. The CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)
NC sensor displays the highest response rate of 73%, on coming in
contact with 100 ppm NO2 gas. More significantly, the CuO–ZnO
NCs also demonstrated an excellent electrocatalytic activity toward
detection followed by oxidative conversion of nitrate with a wide
linear concentration range (20–50 mM) and lower detection limit
(∼1 μM) with higher sensitivity. The modified electrode
offered an appreciable repeatability and reproducibility. Moreover,
the fabricated electrode selectively detected the nitrate in the presence
of intrusive ions. Moreover, the developed sensor electrode showed
good stability. Therefore, the present low-cost CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%)
NC system can be used as an excellent nanoelectrode-based system for
the electrochemical detection of nitrate. This sensor electrode can
be used potentially for the precise detection of nitrate into food
and industrial samples.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals
Zinc acetate, copper acetate, sodium nitrate (extra
pure), acetone, alcohol, ethylene glycol, and poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
(PVP) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich; poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA),
2-propanol, sodium hydroxide, ammonia, and Nafion were of analytical
grade and were purchased from S. D. Fine Chem, India; and deionized
(DI) water (DW) was used for chemical and electrochemical reactions.

4.2 Synthesis of CuO–ZnO
Nanoparticles and Characterization Techniques
The synthesized
CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NCs (in Scheme 3) were expensive when prepared by the chemical
emulsion method. In a 250 mL round-bottom flask, analytical-grade
0.01 mM Cu(Ac)2 and Zn(Ac)2 as a source of “Cu”
and “Zn” were added, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich; these
chemicals were stirred in DI water; further, 0.01 M poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
(PVP, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the reaction mixture; and then,
the mixture was stirred vigorously at RT for 30 min to make a homogeneous
solution of Cu acetate, Zn acetate, and PVP. This mixture was transferred
into an oil bath, and 5 M solution of NaOH was added dropwise into
it up to the pH 10 and refluxed to 80 °C for 8 h to obtain a
brownish-black precipitate. The as-synthesized NCs were washed a number
of times using DW and methanol to eliminate the excess impurities
and dried at 80 °C for 1 h in an oven. The synthesized NC powder
was then transferred into an alumina boat, calcined further at 500
°C for 2 h, and consequently cooled to RT (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Schematic Representation
of As-Synthesized CuO–ZnO NCs by Chemical Synthesis Approach
Using PVP as a Structure-Directing Molecule
For preparing a thin film, CuO–ZnO
NC powder was transferred to a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) solution
as a binder and constantly stirred for 12 h to get a dispersion of
solution. The prepared uniform dispersion of solution of CuO–ZnO
was drop-casted on a glass substrate using the doctor blade method,
and the prepared film was dried in an air atmosphere. This film was
then heated at 400 °C for 2 h to remove the PVA binder and then
used for the gas sensing application.

4.3 Characterization Techniques
Here, crystallinity
and surface morphology of the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) nanocomposites
were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD; model: Ultima IV Rigaku, Cu
Kα source) and TEM (model: JEOL), respectively. Moreover, the
CuO–ZnO nanocomposites were further analyzed through energy-dispersive
spectroscopy. The porosity and surface area were determined through
the BET method at a Quantachrome Auto sorbiQ instrument.

4.4 Gas Sensing Measurement
The CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) nanocomposite gas sensing properties
were calculated with the assist of a routine fabricated two-probe
gas sensor unit.47 To study the response
(Rg/Ra) to
different poisonous gases, the change in the electrical resistance
value of the CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NC-based sensing substrate was
measured and confirmed by a programmable electrometer (model: Keithley
6514), which connects NCs with a two-probe gas sensor arrangement.
A pair of Ag electrodes (0.1 mm thick and 1 cm long) was deposited
on the top of NC materials, with assist of a paintbrush, for electrical
contacts. The CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) materials for gas response
[S (%)] were promising, which can be ascertained
by the following equation48 5  where Rg and Ra are the
electrical resistance standards of CuO(50%)–ZnO(50%) NCs in
the presence of targeted gases and air, respectively
(Figures 8 and 9).

4.5 Preparation of CuO–ZnO Modified Electrode
Electrochemical
NO2 sensing studies were carried out on an electrochemical
setup, CH-Instruments (CHI-660E), using a conventional three-electrode
system. In this setup, a 3 mm diameter modified glassy carbon electrode
(GCE), a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as a reference electrode,
and a Pt wire as a counter electrode were used. First, prior to cleaning of
the GC electrode with polished by alumina powder sequential use 1.0,
0.3, and 0.05 μm, respectively, and washing with all electrodes
distilled water and methanol, ready to use for electrochemical study.
