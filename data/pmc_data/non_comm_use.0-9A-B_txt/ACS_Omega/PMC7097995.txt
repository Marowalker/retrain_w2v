C4F7N (fluorinated nitrile) has been introduced
as a remarkable substitute gas for the greenhouse gas SF6 (sulfur hexafluoride) which is used in gas-insulated equipment (GIE).
Intensive investigations about the compatibility between C4F7N and materials used in GIE are required to decide their
long-term behavior. In this paper, the interaction mechanism between
EPDM, used as a sealing ring in GIE, and C4F7N–CO2 was explored. The composition and morphology
properties of EPDM were first revealed based on scanning electron
microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was found that
EPDM rubber is incompatible with the C4F7N–CO2 gas mixture at temperatures higher than 70 °C. There
exist chemical reactions between EPDM and C4F7N, resulting in the generation of gaseous byproducts including C3F6, CF3H, and C2F5H and corrosion of EPDM. DFT calculation also shows that the interaction
between C4F7N and EPDM could cause the dissociation
of C4F7N. Relevant results provide important
guidance for the engineering application of the C4F7N gas mixture.

1 Introduction
Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) has been widely used as gas
insulating medium in all kinds of gas-insulated equipment (GIE) since
the 1970s because of its excellent insulation and arc-quenching properties.1−4 However, SF6 is one of the greenhouse gases with a global
warming potential (GWP) 23 500 times higher than that of CO2 (over a time horizon of 100 years) and an atmospheric lifespan
of 3200 years.5−7 The power industry accounts for 80% of the worldwide
sale of SF6.8 Therefore, seeking
an eco-friendly gas insulating medium to replace SF6 used
in GIE has become a hot spot in recent years.

At present, C4F7N ((2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-2-(trifluoromethyl)-2-propanenitrile,
fluorinated nitrile) has been introduced as the remarkable substitute
gas to SF6.9,10 C4F7N has
a GWP value of 2090, a dielectric strength twice that of SF6, and a boiling point of −4.7 °C.10 It needs to be mixed with CO2, N2, or air for engineering application because of its high liquefaction
temperature. The GWP of the C4F7N gas mixture
with 4, 6, and 10% C4F7N is 327, 462, and 690,
respectively. In addition, the LC50 of 10% C4F7N gas mixture is in the range of 95 500 to 100 000
ppm (parts per million, μL/L), which is classified as a nontoxic
substance according to the CLP regulation 1272/2008.10 Several studies have been conducted on the performance
evaluation of C4F7N including insulation properties,11−14 decomposition characteristics,15−20 arc extinguishing performance,21 and
toxicity22,23 over the past three years, which confirm
that C4F7N can be used as a substitute to SF6 for medium-voltage and high-voltage applications.

It
has been proven that GIE including gas-insulated switchgear
(GIS), gas-insulated bus, and gas-insulated current transformer filled
with C4F7N gas mixture could pass relevant electrical
standard tests.9 GIE is designed for a
lifetime of 30 years or more. During this period, the effort for maintenance
should be kept on a low level. Thus, intensive investigations about
the compatibility between C4F7N and the materials
used in GIE are required to decide about a long-term behavior. The
compartments of GIE include metal (copper, aluminum, and steel), polymers
(epoxy resin, rubber, and thermoplastic materials), oils, and desiccants,
which are all (at least partly) in contact with the insulation gas.
There might be aging processes caused by the combination of the used
materials and the insulation gas mixture. The interaction might lead
to changed properties of the material itself, but can also influence
the quality of the insulation gas. Both effects must be investigated
for all used materials. Studies on the decomposition properties of
C4F7N–CO2 or C4F7N–N2 gas mixtures under AC breakdown,
thermal and arc-quenching conditions indicate that CF4,
C2F6, C3F6, C3F8, CF3CN, C2F5CN, C2N2, COF2, CO, and HF are the main generated
byproducts.16−19 The generation of C3F6 and CO is common for
thermal decomposition conditions and CF4 and CF3CN are the main products after breakdown.18,19 The decomposition mechanism of C4F7N was also
explored by several researchers using density functional theory (DFT)
and reactive force field (ReaxFF).18,20 Our group
also explored the compatibility of C4F7N–N2 gas mixture with copper and aluminum. It was found that C4F7N–N2 gas mixture has better
compatibility with heated aluminum (at 120–220 °C) than
that of copper. The decomposition of C4F7N and
generation of C3F6, CF3H was confirmed.15 In addition, it was reported that leakage of
SF6 because of the sealing ring failure accounts for 30–40%
GIE defects.24 Thus, the compatibility
of the sealing ring and gas is an important factor to determine the
reliability of equipment. At present, the seal materials mostly used
in GIE are ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) and nitrile butadiene
rubber. In addition, there are few studies on the compatibility between
EPDM and C4F7N gas mixture.

In this paper,
we conducted aging tests for EPDM using as a sealing
ring in GIE under the C4F7N–CO2 environment first. The gas components of C4F7N–CO2 gas mixture and the morphology of EPDM was
revealed based on the gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
(GC–MS), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). Then, the interaction mechanism between EPDM and
C4F7N was analyzed based on the DFT. The possible
reaction pathways were considered and the reaction enthalpy was also
calculated. Relevant results not only reveal the compatibility between
EPDM and C4F7N gas mixture first but also provide
reference for the engineering application of the C4F7N gas mixture.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Compatibility between C4F7N–CO2 and EPDM
2.1.1 Gas Components Analysis
The EPDM
samples were put in the holder in the test chamber. Then, the chamber
was filled with 0.3 MPa C4F7N–CO2 gas mixture and heated at 70 and 80 °C for 90 h. A control
group was also set without the EPDM sample to exclude other possible
factors on the results. The gas mixture was detected by the GC–MS,
and the EPDM was analyzed by SEM and XPS at the end of test. Detailed
information on the test process can be found in the Method section.

According to the gas chromatogram of
the 10%C4F7N–90%CO2 gas mixture
after aging tests, as shown in Figure 1, the characteristic peak of CF3H exists
for both the control group (80 °C) and the test group (70, 80
°C). As for the aging test at 80 °C, another gaseous byproduct
C3F6 can be found. In addition, the generation
of C2F5H is also confirmed considering the existence
of the characteristic mass charge ratio (m/z) of 101 (C2F4H group).

Figure 1 Gas chromatogram
of the 10%C4F7N–90%CO2 gas
mixture after aging tests.

Figure 2 shows the
content of detected byproducts under different conditions. The interaction
between EPDM and C4F7N–CO2 gas mixture generated 0.95 ppm (control group, 80 °C), 0.33
ppm (test group, 70 °C), and 13.01 ppm (test group, 80 °C)
C3F6, respectively. It should be noted that
the initial decomposition temperature of the C4F7N–CO2 gas mixture is higher than 350 or 650 °C.10,15 Therefore, there exists chemical reaction between EPDM and C4F7N at 80 °C. The peak area integral calculation
shows that the content of CF3H and C2F5H increased sharply when the gas temperature reached 80 °C,
indicating that the temperature has quite the effect on the reaction
between the C4F7N–CO2 gas
mixture and EPDM. In addition, the content of C3F6, CF3H at 70 °C is lower than the control group and
the difference is relatively small. This is due to the test temperature
of the control group being set to 80 °C and the detection limit
of GC–MS at low content.

Figure 2 Content of detected byproducts under different
temperature conditions.
(a) C3F6, (b) CF3H, and (c) C2F5H.

Overall, the gas composition
analysis confirms that the chemical
reaction between EPDM and C4F7N–CO2 gas mixture occurs at temperatures around 80 °C, resulting
in the generation of characteristic byproducts C3F6, CF3H, and C2F5H. The duration
time will also have influence on the test results because of the cumulative
effect considering the long term operation of the equipment.

2.1.2 Morphology Analysis
Figure 3 shows the morphology of the
EPDM rubber before and after interaction. It is apparent that the
surface morphology of the untreated EPDM sample was homogeneous and
smooth, and no obvious defects can be found at the magnification of
5000× and 10 000×. The appearance of white spots
exists (see the red circle in Figure 3b) for the EPDM exposed to C4F7N–CO2 gas mixture at 70 °C for 90 h, indicating
that C4F7N causes corrosion of EPDM. When the
gas temperature reaches 80 °C, there exist white spots randomly
distributed on the EPDM surface (as shown in Figure 3c). The EDPM surface is corroded seriously
at this condition because strong chemical reaction occurs between
them.

(b) treated at 70 °C for 90 h, and (c) treated at 80 °C
for 90 h.

It should be noted that the maximum
operating temperature of electrical
equipment is 40 °C according to IEC 61869-1-2007. Considering
the temperature-rise effect during the normal operation of GIE, the
temperature of the sealing material will be in the range of 40–70
°C. Therefore, the service life of EPDM for GIE using the C4F7N gas mixture as the insulating medium reduces.

2.1.3 XPS Analysis
Table 1 shows the XPS survey analysis results. It
can be found that the composition of untreated and treated EPDM at
70 °C is similar, which is quite different to the treated EPDM
at 80 °C. In particular, the composition of the F element increased
from 1.52% (70 °C) to 4.67% (80 °C), confirming that the
fluorine accumulation process happens during the interaction. The
atomic composition of N also increased by 0.97% as the temperature
changes from 70 to 80 °C. The content of C and O element has
a little difference for the untreated EPDM and treated EPDM at 70
°C.

Figure 4 gives the
high-resolution XPS spectra of the EPDM rubber treated with 10%C4F7N–90%CO2 gas mixture. All the
peaks were fitted based on XPS Peak software employing Gauss–Lorentz
curves after subtraction of a Shirleytype background. The carbon calibrations
were also conducted. As shown in Figure 4a, the characteristic peak located at 284.8
eV belongs to C–H or C–C bonds. In addition, the other
two peaks are assigned to C–O, C–O–C, or C–N
bond at 286.1 eV and C=O or O–C–O at 288.5 eV.25,26

Figure 4 XPS
spectra for the surface of EPDM rubber treated with 10%C4F7N–90%CO2 gas mixture. (a) C
1s, (b) O 1s, and (c) F 1s.

As for the O 1s spectra shown in Figure 4b, the peaks located at 532.3 and 533.3 eV
correspond to the C=O and C–O–C component, respectively.27 Overall, the composition of C and O for the
untreated and treated EPDM is similar. In addition, the high-resolution
spectra of F 1s includes two characteristic peaks located at 684.5
and 688.3 eV. The binding energy of F 1s close to 684.5 eV belongs
to the F that is ironically fixed to the C atom.28,29 This characteristic peak is not found for the untreated EPDM (quite
low peak intensity). Moreover, the peak area of the C–F component
increased obviously with temperature, indicating that the accumulation
of fluorine occurs severely because of the reaction between EPDM and
C4F7N–CO2. The other peak
located at 688.3 eV is assigned to the CFxCHx group, corresponding to organic fluorine
components. It is reported that there exists a significant shift of
about 4 eV between the organic and inorganic fluoride components.30 Thus, the two peaks of F 1s confirms that the
generation of the inorganic fluoride component occurs after the aging
tests.

Overall, XPS results indicates that EPDM rubber undergoes
accumulation
of fluorine when interacted with C4F7N–CO2 gas mixture. This process is accelerated with the increase
of temperature, which is consistent well with the GC–MS and
SEM test results.

2.2 Interaction Mechanism between
C4F7N and EPDM
2.2.1 Structure
Properties and Decomposition of
EPDM
In order to understand the interaction mechanism between
EPDM and C4F7N, we performed DFT calculations
to reveal the structure properties of the interaction system.

The typical chemical structure of EPDM consists ethylene, propylene,
and diene units. Ethylidene norbornene (ENB) is usually used as diene,
as shown in Figure 5.31 The ethylene–propylene–ENB
chain was chosen as the EDPM polymer model for DFT calculations. This
scheme is also used by Yamada et al. to investigate the interaction
mechanism between nitrile rubber and fuel species based on DFT.32 Considering the complex molecular structure
of C4F7N and EPDM, the interaction between them
discussed in this paper is mainly concentrated on the reaction of
EPDM defects or particles and C4F7N. The EPDM
defects and particles have unsaturated chemical bonds, which have
stronger reactivity than the EPDM molecule. That is to say, the reaction
between C4F7N and EPDM defects or particles
occurs easier than the EPDM molecule. In this section, we first analyzed
the structural properties of the EPDM monomer. Then, the possible
defect formation pathways of EPDM were analyzed. In addition, the
possible interaction between the C4F7N and several
kinds of EPDM defects was explored.

Figure 5 Chemical structure of EPDM.

Figure 6 shows
the
calculated Mayer bond order (MBO) of EDPM. MBO is widely used to describe
the relative strength of chemical bonds.33 It can be found that the C=C bond has the largest MBO value
(1.763) and the MBO of the C–H bond in EDPM is smaller than
most of the C–C bond. Moreover, four main dissociation paths
were analyzed to reveal the formation of EDPM defects (as shown in Figure 7).

Figure 6 MBO of EPDM.

Figure 7 Considered decomposition paths of EPDM.

Figure 8 demonstrates
the calculated reaction enthalpy of considered EPDM dissociation paths.
The dissociation of EPDM through path A requires adsorption of 85.37
kcal/mol. Moreover, the bond-breaking process of EPDM through path
B to generate C9H13 and C5H11 has the lowest reaction enthalpy among all the considered paths
(83.76 kcal/mol), which is most likely to occur. The production of
C13H21 and CH3 through Path C has
the highest reaction enthalpy of 108.61 kcal/mol. The dehydrogenation
process of EPDM via path D has a reaction enthalpy of 93.56 kcal/mol.

the GGA-PBE level, with ZPE correction and enthalpy correction, T = 298.15 K. (a) Dissociation path A. (b) Dissociation
path B. (c) Dissociation path C. (d) Dissociation path D.

2.2.2 Reaction Mechanism between C4F7N and EPDM
The degradation of EPDM occurs during
the aging process, which could generate several kinds of particles
or defects on its surface. Moreover, the decomposition of C4F7N starts at temperatures higher than 350 °C.10,19 Thus, we mainly considered the reaction between C4F7N and EPDM decomposed particles or defects to investigate
the reaction mechanism between them.

Table 2 gives the reaction paths and enthalpy between
EPDM-decomposed particles through path A and C4F7N. All the proposed reaction paths have a negative reaction enthalpy,
indicating that the reactions are thermodynamically supported. For
the situation that the N atom in C4F7N close
to the C11H17 and C3H7 (path A1 and A3), optimized structures show that the distance between
N and C atoms is shortened. The distance of C atoms in C11H17 and N atoms in C4F7N changes
to 1.473 Å after interaction. The bond angle of the CN group
which connected to the central C atoms of C4F7N also changes to 140.55°. As for reaction paths A2 and A4,
the F atom linked to the central C atom of C4F7N is composed of a new chemical bond with the C atom in C11H17 and C3H7, and another product
C4F6N is produced after interaction. The reaction
enthalpy of path A2 (−29.39 kcal/mol) and A4 (−23.44
kcal/mol) is also lower than that of A1 (−16.19 kcal/mol) and
A3 (−15.84 kcal/mol), which are more likely to occur. The accumulation
of fluorine might occur through these two reaction paths.

Table 2 Reaction between EPDM Decomposed Particles
through Path A and C4F7N: At GGA-PBE Level,
with ZPE Correction and Enthalpy Correction, T =
298.15 K
The considered reaction
paths between EPDM decomposed particles
through path B and C4F7N is given in Table 3. The reaction enthalpy
of all the paths is also negative. Similar to paths A1 and A3, the
N atom in C4F7N tends to form new chemical bonds
with EPDM defect particles. The distance between the N atom and C
atom in EPDM is shortened. As for reaction paths B2 and B4, the C–F
bond in C4F7N breaks and a new bond between
F and C in the EPDM is produced after interaction. These two paths
are more likely to occur because of the lower enthalpy, which is another
possible fluorine accumulation paths.

Table 3 Reaction
between EPDM Decomposed Particles
through Path B and C4F7N
Table 4 gives the
interaction paths between EPDM decomposed particles through path C,
D, and C4F7N. We can find that paths C2 and
C1 have the lowest reaction enthalpies of −46.31 and −40.97
kcal/mol, respectively. Thus, the above two reactions are more likely
to occur. In addition, the reaction mechanism for the N atom or F
atom in C4F7N closed to the EPDM defect particles
is similar to that of Tables 2 and Table 3.

Table 4 Reaction between EPDM Decomposed Particles
through Path C, D and C4F7N
According to the above results, the interaction between
C4F7N and EPDM defects and particles will result
in the
adsorption and dissociation of C4F7N. The N
atom in the CN group of C4F7N has the tendency
to form new bonds with EPDM defects or particles. The F atom connected
to the central C atom of C4F7N could react with
the EPDM particles, causing the dissociation of C4F7N to generate C4F6N as well as forming
a new F–C bond with EPDM. These reaction paths could explain
the accumulation of fluorine on the EPDM after aging.

2.2.3 Discussion
According to the above-mentioned
results, EPDM rubber is incompatible with C4F7N–CO2 gas mixture at temperatures higher than 70
°C. The interaction between them will result in the decomposition
of C4F7N, generating CF3H, C3F6, and C2F5H. The corrosion
of the EPDM surface occurs and the accumulation of fluorine exists.

At present, there is no general standard defined on how compatibility
for materials in contact with C4F7N gas mixture
has to be tested. The test procedure must be defined by the manufacturer
in a way to confirm that the impact of the material on the gas and
the impact of the gas and possible decomposition products on the material
does not affect the safety and performance of equipment in an unacceptable
level.34

In addition, Kieffel pointed
out that gas permeability of the elastomer
material used for gaskets should be considered because of the CO2 molecule is smaller than C4F7N or SF6. The designed O-ring for GIS should be tight with enough
reliability during all its lifetime and meet the maximum allowed leakage
rate of 0.5% per compartment per year as specified in IEC 62271-203.10

Butyl rubber is known to be tight toward
low-molecular weight gases
such as CO2 and it has been widely used in the automotive
industry for tires.10 Halogenated butyl
rubber which has no double bond on the main molecular chain and is
not sensitive to ozone could be a candidate for C4F7N–CO2 gas mixture equipment. It was reported
that the permeation rate coefficient of halogenated butyl rubber under
C4F7N–a CO2 environment at
20 °C is lower than that of EPDM.10 While its stability under working temperature conditions needs to
be further tested.

3 Conclusions
In this
paper, we explored the compatibility between EPDM and C4F7N. The composition and morphology properties
of EPDM and C4F7N–CO2 gas
mixture after aging tests were obtained based on the GC–MS,
SEM, and XPS. The interaction mechanism between EPDM and C4F7N is also revealed based on the DFT calculations. The
following useful conclusions can be obtained,(1) EPDM exposed under
a C4F7N–CO2 environment at
temperatures
around 80 °C will result in the decomposition of C4F7N, producing several characteristic byproducts including
C3F6, CF3H, and C2F5H. The EDPM surface will be corroded seriously at temperatures
around 80 °C. The fluorine accumulation process also exists during
the interaction.

(2) Interaction
between C4F7N and EPDM defects and particles
cause the adsorption and
dissociation of C4F7N. The N atom in the CN
group of C4F7N has the tendency to form new
bonds with the EPDM. In addition, the F atom connected to the central
C atom of C4F7N could react with EPDM particles
to generate C4F6N as well as form new F–C
bonds with EPDM.

(3) EPDM
rubber is incompatible with the
C4F7N–CO2 gas mixture at temperatures
higher than 70 °C. It is necessary to conduct relevant modification
on EPDM or finding other compatible rubber used as the O-ring for
C4F7N–CO2 GIE in engineering
application.



4 Methods
4.1 Experimental Methods
4.1.1 Test Platform
The aging tests were
conducted to explore the compatibility between EPDM and C4F7N. The test platform mainly consists of the heating
system, the temperature control system and the gas chamber (as shown
in Figure 9). The gas
chamber with a volume 2 L is made of 304 L stainless-steel, which
could withstand a high pressure of 0.6 MPa. The stainless-steel sample
holder is placed at the bottom of the gas chamber to carry the EDPM
rubber sample. The gas chamber is sealed using the fluororubber, which
generally has wide chemical resistance. All the test chambers were
sealed tightly, and no gas leakage was found during the test. The
heating element is put in the center of the heat transfer bushing,
which is installed on the top cover plate of the gas chamber. The
temperature control system consists of the temperature sensor, the
switch power supply and the solid-state relay. The K-type temperature
sensor is used to monitor the temperature of the C4F7N–CO2 gas mixture. The gas sensor sends
signals to the proportion integration differentiation controller.
The controller could compare the actual temperature with the set value
and send a control signal to the solid-state relay to realize the
switching power supply control.

Figure 9 Structure of the aging test system.

4.1.2 Materials and Test Conditions
We
used the C4F7N–CO2 gas mixture
to carry out thermal aging tests. Relevant studies reported that CO2 has a great synergism effect with C4F7N, and CO2 also shows better arc quenching capabilities
compared with N2.8 It was pointed
out that the concentration of C4F7N in the gas
mixture should be less than 10% for the working pressure of 0.5 MPa.
Thus, we used 10%C4F7N–90%CO2 gas mixture to conduct relevant tests. C4F7N is supplied by 3 M China with a purity higher than 99.2%. In addition,
the standard gas for 10%C4F7N–90%CO2 is provided by Wuhan Newradar Special Gas Co., Ltd. The EPDM
rubber O-rings is supplied by Xu Ji Group Corporation, State Grid.

The EPDM O-ring we obtained is cylindrical as shown in Figure 10. The sealing ring
was cut into the semi-cylindrical structure for the convenience of
relevant SEM and XPS testing. The semi-cylindrical O-ring was put
on the sample holder in the chamber. The gas chamber was evacuated
using the vacuum pump to 10–4 to 10–5 Pa first and then filled with 10%C4F7N–90%CO2 to 0.3 MPa. This procedure is repeated 3 times to remove
gas impurities. As for the control group, EPDM was not put in the
test chamber. The gas pressure of all the test groups is set to 0.3
MPa. The using of 0.3 MPa is for the safety consideration because
the heating of the gas mixture will result in the gas pressure increase.
In addition, it was reported that the current-carrying metallic conductor
of GIE for engineering application has a temperature rise effect of
about 70 °C (the absolute temperature lower than 115 °C)
normally.15 While the temperature of the
equipment shell and O-rings is usually around 40–70 °C
(absolute temperature). Thus, the test temperature condition in this
paper was set to 70 and 80 °C. The duration time also has influence
on the test results because of the cumulative effect. Here, the exposure
time is set to 90 h to explore the interaction between EPDM and C4F7N–CO2 gas mixture. There are
currently no compatibility testing standards for the non-SF6 gas insulating medium with materials. The select of 90 h is based
on the time cost.

Figure 10 Structure of the EPDM semi cylindrical O-ring.

4.1.3 Morphology and Component Analysis
The gas mixture after aging tests were collected and analyzed using
GC–MS (Shimadzu QP2010 Ultra). The column type is CP-Sil5CB
(60 m × 8 μm × 0.32 mm). Both the SCAN and SIM method
were used to detect the gas components. The heating scheme of the
GC is listed as follows: (1) Keep the column at 32 °C for 10
min. (2) Heat the column to150 °C at the rate of 60 °C/min
and retain it for 2 min. The gas component is confirmed based on the
NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) standard database
and standard gases.

The morphology of the EPDM was analyzed
using a Zeiss SIGMA field-emission scanning electron microscope manufactured
by Carl Zeiss. Moreover, the components of the EPDM surface were detected
by XPS (ESCALAB250Xi electron spectrometer manufactured by Thermo
Fisher Scientific of United States).

4.2 Theoretical
Methods
In order to investigate
the interaction mechanism between C4F7N and
EPDM, we carried out spin-polarized DFT calculations based on the
Dmol3 package of Materials Studio.35,36 DFT has been widely used to calculate the structure and ground-state
energy of molecules.6,7 The generalized gradient approximation
with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional [generalized
gradient approximation (GGA)-PBE] method was applied to treat the
electron exchange and correlation.37 We
chose the double numerical plus polarization (DNP) as the atomic basis
set and all electron core treatment was selected.38 The convergence tolerance for geometry optimization calculation
was listed as follows: (1) 1.0 × 10–6 Ha for
energy, (2) 0.005 Å for displacement, and (3) 0.002 Ha/Å
for gradients. Frequency analysis was also conducted for all the reactants
and products.

The reaction enthalpy is defined as follows 1  

The negative value of reaction enthalpy indicates
that the reaction
is thermodynamic spontaneous and the positive value of the reaction
enthalpy means the reaction belongs to endothermic process. Zero-point
vibration energy and enthalpy correction (at 298.15 K) were both considered
for reaction enthalpy calculations. It should be noted that the numerical
basis sets implemented in Dmol3 code are more complete
than the traditional Gaussian functions, thereby minimizing or even
eliminating basis set superposition error.39−42
