Despite several studies on traffic
calming devices, information
on particulate matter contribution by vehicle abrasion and wear nearby
vertical deflections of speed humps is scant. Many studies have been
performed in the recent past on heavy metal contamination at roads
mainly at intersections. On the other hand, the traffic calming devices
were studied for their effectiveness in reducing the vehicle speed
and thereby increasing road safety, but their environmental effects
are neglected. In the present study, the relation between the concentrations of Cu and Zn (marker heavy metals for
traffic sources) at speed humps were nearly thrice to that in intersections,
while for another marker heavy metal Pb, it was found nearly twice
in comparison. Pollution load index >3 was observed upto 7.5–8.8
m distances of speed humps, and these were identified as hotspot zones
for traffic-generated pollution. Furthermore, this heavy-metal-laden
speed hump soil can pose a threat to living beings by virtue of resuspension
produced by vehicular movements. Therefore, it is necessary to manage
this emerging environmental issue, and we propose a traffic calming
device with wheel cut-out provision for different vehicle classes
as an alternate.

Introduction
Road characteristic is a well-known factor
as a substantial contributor
to affect traffic flow, traveler’s safety, intrusive noise,
air quality of nearby road microenvironments, and associated environmental
issues.1 Over the last decade, unprecedented
growth of personal vehicle usage in developing countries with limited
development in road facilities has resulted in increasing time share
in traveling and growing traffic accidents.2 Especially, at road networks where mixed traffic prevails, these
personal vehicles travel with a much higher speed than slowly moving
public vehicles. As a consequence of these factors, the augmented
road accidents have further increased and are the growing menace on
the roads the world over. This has resulted in increased frequency
of traffic calming devices.3 Most of the
urban air, road dust, and soil quality studies are carried out near
intersections and street canyons,4−7 but information on heavy metal near these
traffic calming devices is scant.

Nowadays, the most common
traffic safety measures are related to
vertical changes of the roads; such as speed humps, speed bumps, and
speed tables; and horizontal changes on the alignment; such as roundabouts
and chicanes.3 Most of the traffic calming
devices were studied for their effectiveness in reducing the vehicle
speed and thereby increasing road safety.3,8−12 The drastic change in traffic speed near traffic calming devices
was highly correlated to gaseous pollutant emission.13−17 In developing countries, owing to lack of traffic rules to monitor
fast moving vehicles, navigating to unpaved shoulders at the speed
hump is also a unique driving behavior.18 Therefore, at first look, roads in these countries appear to have
greater soil from the unpaved shoulders. In recent times, the variation
in driving cycles of vehicle types in cities have been observed from
their legislative ones.19 Furthermore,
it is clear that the safer speed limits and the type and amount of
traffic in developing countries are quite different from those in
developed countries. Thus, the impact of traffic calming devices on
nearby environment in such developing countries may differ significantly
and therefore is required to be studied precisely in detail.

Concentrations of vehicular emitted heavy metals in roadside soils
result in long-term environmental damage.20−22 It was reported
that Cu, Zn, and Pb could indicate traffic pollution and could continue
to accumulate in urban environment due to their nonbiodegradability
and long residence time; thus, they are also known as “chemical
time bombs”.23,24 Many studies have been performed
on contamination of road soil due to vehicle-emitted marker heavy
metals, Cu (brake wear), Zn (tire wear), and Pb (exhaust and nonexhaust
emission), around the world.21,22,25−36 However, detailed investigation on traffic-generated heavy metals
around speed humps in road soils is not yet reported.

The present
study deals with the characterization and distribution
of speed humps and intersection soils along the road to find the information
on interheavy metal relationship and impact of distance on speed hump
road soil contamination. The assessment of the contamination level
of heavy metals at these speed humps was compared to that at other
sites using the contamination factor (CF), pollution load index (PLI),
modified degree of contamination (mCd), geoaccumulation index (Igeo),
and ecological risk index (RI). Much has been written on the impact
of vehicular emission on the road dust and nearby soil, but its impact
on speed hump microenvironment is limited. Therefore, the present
study provides useful information on traffic contaminants and identifies
an emerging urban hotspot zone for traffic-generated pollution.

Furthermore, resolution of heavy metal issues in immediate
effect as well as in long term at speed hump microenvironments is
discussed. The present study draws the attention of environmentalists
and strategy makers of developing countries toward speed hump’s
deteriorating effect on ecology and proposes an alternative to encourage
the management of this emerging environmental issue with the help
of scientific approach.

Results and Discussion
Heavy Metal Concentrations
in Road Soil
The concentration
profiles of Cu, Zn, and Pb in traffic sites were observed in the undertaken
study at distances of 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 50, 100, and 200 m away from
the speed humps. Heavy metal concentrations at speed humps and intersections
are presented in Figure 1. A total number of 255 heavy metal values (17 sites × 5 samples
× 3 metals) along the road nearby speed humps and at five intersections
are measured.

Figure 1 Spatial distribution of mean concentrations of heavy metals
in
road soil on both sides (1 and 2) of speed humps at a 1–200
m distance and at intersections (I).

Among the Heavy Metals
Among the heavy metals, the
mean concentrations of Cu, Zn, and Pb were obtained in the range of
51.9 ± 8.8 to 186.5 ± 18.7 mg kg–1, 220.5
± 55.3 to 548.6 ± 49.6 mg kg–1, and 22.9
± 11.6 to 61.1 ± 9.6 mg kg–1, respectively.
High concentration of heavy metals at speed humps may be a result
of excessive brake wear, tire wear, and tailpipe emission. Heavy metals
at speed humps were found in the order of Zn > Cu > Pb. The
concentrations
of heavy metals are very high with respect to their background values
(their corresponding concentrations in preindustrial soil), which
are 45, 95, and 20 mg kg–1, respectively.37 At speed humps, metal concentrations were found
to be >4-fold for Cu and Zn and ∼ 3-fold for Pb with respect
to their background values. The observed mean concentrations of Cu,
Zn, and Pb at intersections were 56.0 ± 7.61, 158.4 ± 7.56,
and 32.4 ± 5.35 mg kg–1, respectively. Heavy
metal mean concentrations at intersections were 1.2–1.6 times
greater than background values. Their concentrations were found slightly
greater than 2-fold with respect to the values at speed humps. Results
indicated that these speed humps were even more contaminated than
the intersections in terms of these heavy metals.

Effect of Speed
Humps on Contamination with Respect to Distance
Among the
heavy metals nearby speed humps, the highest mean concentrations
obtained at 1 m for Cu, Zn, and Pb on side 1 were 186.5 ± 18.7
mg kg–1 at 1 m, 541.6 ± 27.4 mg kg–1 at 2 m, and 57.5 ± 12.6 mg kg–1. Lowest values
obtained for Cu, Zn, and Pb were 51.9 ± 8.8 mg kg–1 (at 200 m), 158.4 ± 7.56 mg kg–1 (at intersections),
and 22.9 ± 11.6 mg kg–1 (at 200 m), respectively.
On moving along the road and away from speed humps on side 2, highest
mean concentrations obtained for Cu, Zn, and Pb were 183.0 ±
17.4 mg kg–1 at 1 m, 548.6 ± 49.6 mg kg–1 at 1 m, and 61.1 ± 9.6 mg kg–1 at 2 m, respectively. The sharp decrease in concentrations of heavy
metals away from speed humps proves them as hotspots. Especially,
at speed humps, deceleration is significantly high due to brakes exerted
by drivers to minimize mechanical damage to vehicles. The high concentration
nearby speed humps may be a result of excessive use of brakes by drivers
while maneuvering their vehicles over them. Consequently, tailpipe
emission also increases to accelerate just after the vehicle passes
the speed humps. This could have resulted in the elevated heavy metal
emission in nearby speed humps.

Assessment of Road Contamination
Using Indices
CF values
of the road soil along with the different grades of CF are presented
in Figure 2. Values
of CF for Cu revealed that upto 2 m it was strongly contaminated,
whereas it was moderately to strongly contaminated upto 5 m. For Zn,
upto 3 m significance of estimated CF values showed that upto 3 m
strong to very strong contamination occurred. For Zn, upto 50 m distance,
moderate to strong contamination was observed for Zn. The estimated
significance of CF values for Pb showed that upto 3 m of distance
was moderately to strongly contaminated. It has provided the basic
information on the contamination of road soil near speed humps. Continuous
emission of heavy metals from vehicles may result in a long-term environmental
damage. For the assessment of environmental pollution or contamination
at speed humps, other indices were used based on CF values. Heavy
metals Cu and Zn at speed humps indicated that their values were nearly
thrice to that in intersection road soil, whereas for Pb, it was nearly
twice in comparison.

Figure 2 Variations in the contamination factor (CF) of heavy metals
in
road soil on both the sides (1 and 2) of speed humps at 1–200
m distance and at traffic intersections (I).

PLI values of heavy metals in road soil on both the sides
(1 and
2) of speed humps at 1–200 m distance and at traffic intersections
are presented in Figure 3. PLI values (>1) indicated progressive deterioration of the analyzed
sites nearby speed humps. Distances upto 5 m showed PLI >3, whereas
for distance >10 m, PLI values were <3. In the case of intersections
also, it was observed to be 1.44, which showed that they are contaminated
by heavy metals emitted from vehicles.

Figure 3 Pollution load index
(PLI) of heavy metals in road soil on both
the sides (1 and 2) of speed humps at 1–200 m distance and
at traffic intersections (I).

On the basis of cumulative effects due to heavy metals, mCd
was
estimated for road soil using their CF values for the respective distances.
Estimated mCd values for each location are presented in Figure 4. Significance of mCd showed
that upto 3 m distance, high degree of contamination occurred, whereas
upto 50 m, moderate degree of contamination was estimated nearby speed
humps. mCd values for speed humps were more than twice the values
observed for intersections. mCd values indicate that at intersections
moderate degree of contamination exists.

Figure 4 Variations in the modified
degree of contamination (mCd) in road
soil on both the sides (1 and 2) of speed humps at 1–200 m
distance and at traffic intersections (I).

On the other hand, Igeo index values can be a quantitative
measure
of the degree of pollution in road soil. Igeo values of the road soil
are presented in Figure 5. At speed humps, the observed Igeo for Cu, Zn, and Pb showed that
contamination is not of huge concern. According to the Igeo index,
only upto 5 m for Cu, 50 m for Zn, and 2 m for Pb were the distances
that had contamination of moderate level. Rest distances were recognized
as either uncontaminated to slightly contaminated (upto distances
of 50 m (Cu), 200 m (Zn), and 10 m (Pb)) or practically uncontaminated
thereafter. Negative Igeo values were observed for Cu and Pb at 100–200
and 50–200 m, respectively, which showed that the road soil
is uncontaminated with these metals. For Zn, road soil is moderately
contaminated upto 50 m and after that it is uncontaminated. For intersections,
Igeo for all three metals in road soil depicted that they are uncontaminated.

Figure 5 Variations
in geoaccumulation index (Igeo) of heavy metals in road
soil on both the sides (1 and 2) of speed humps at 1–200 m
distance and at traffic intersections (I).

The Igeo and CF values showed that the contamination levels
were
in order of Zn > Cu > Pb. They indicated the anthropogenic influence
on those sites and hence their contamination level. Furthermore, speed
humps had Igeo >1 for all three metals. This indicates that the
road
soils are moderately contaminated by the metals derived from anthropogenic
sources. Results indicate that the road environment nearby speed humps
is more than 2 times more polluted than that of intersections, which
are already known sites for environmental pollution.

Variations
in the risk index (RI) of heavy metals in the collected
road soil are presented in Figure 6. However, the estimated RI values (with maximum RI
= 41) indicated no ecological risk at the studied speed humps because there was variation
observed in different indices while identifying a distance upto which
environmental pollution occurred near speed humps. Therefore, to exactly
identify the length of hotspot for contamination due to traffic sources
nearby speed humps, a zone was determined using PLI values.

Figure 6 Variations
in the risk index (RI) of heavy metals in road soil
on both the sides (1 and 2) of speed humps at 1–200 m distance
and at traffic intersections (I).

Identification of Hotspot Zones for Contamination Due to Traffic
Sources Nearby Speed Humps
Data analysis at speed humps showed
that distribution of heavy metals on both the sides (sides 1 and 2)
followed a nonlinear pattern and is presented in Figure 7. The observed data in the
contamination of road soils encourages us to find the actual prone
area or zone that is under the high influence of contamination due
to traffic sources. Hence, the mathematical evaluation of this hotspot
zone for pollutants using PLI values may provide necessary information
to environmentalists and policy makers to act upon this emerging issue
in urban speed hump microenvironments. The profile for distribution
of heavy metals at the different distances on both sides from the
speed humps upto 200 m is presented in Figure 7a. Results showed that the observed heavy
metals were distributed in a logarithmic pattern along the roads at
the speed humps. Mean values were traced and obtained logarithmic
equations of their distribution are presented in eq 1 (with R2 = 0.971)
and eq 2 (with R2 = 0.976), respectively. 1   2  where, y1 and y2 are the values of PLI (unitless and dimensionless) for road
soil at sides 1 and 2 of speed humps, respectively, and x is the distance in meters.

Figure 7 Profiles of PLI of heavy metals on both the
sides of speed humps
along the road and respective trendlines for distances upto 200 m
(a) and distances in between 1 and 10 m (b).

Profiles of PLI of heavy metals on both the sides of speed
humps
for distances 10 m is presented in Figure 7b. Average values of PLI due to three heavy
metals Cu, Zn, and Pb in the zone of upto 10 m on both the sides were
also found to be in a nonlinear pattern and in a decreasing exponential
form. Mean values were traced, and equations of their distribution
are presented in eq 3 (with R2 = 0.957) and eq 4 (with R2 = 0.943), respectively. For this zone, the obtained equations were
of exponential type and are expressed as follows 3   4  where y3 and y4 are the values of PLI (unitless and dimensionless)
for road soil at sides 1 and 2 of speed humps, respectively, and x is the distance in meters.

Using these distribution
patterns, an area or a zone was estimated
around the speed humps that represented the most affected area, as
far as the environment is concerned. Distances at which PLI ≥
3 for heavy metals were considered highly contaminated, and the zones
in between these distances were identified here as new hotspots for
pollution on roads. These hotspots for road soil contamination due
to heavy metals at speed humps in urban roadways of developing countries
may pose harmful health effects to the commuters as well as residing
inhabitants. The hotspots for metal contamination on road were estimated
using eqs 3 and 4. Results revealed that upto 7.50 and 8.80 m distances
on either sides of the speed humps needed strategies to decrease road
soil contamination on urgent basis.

Statistical Analysis of
Heavy Metal Data
Analysis of
data for its quality was performed using different statistical tools.
Significant Spearman’s ρ correlation among Cu, Zn, and
Pb with varying distances from the speed humps are presented in Table 1. Data analysis revealed
that a significant negative correlation was present among heavy metals
Cu, Zn, and Pb and distances from speed humps on either sides. Therefore,
while moving away from the speed humps, heavy metal concentrations
were found to decrease. Observed significant Spearman’s ρ
correlation coefficients (r) (p ≤
0.01) were −0.917, −0.938, and −0.802 between increasing distances and Cu, Zn, and Pb, respectively. On
the other hand, a strong positive correlation between the couple heavy
metals (Cu–Zn, Cu–Pb, and Zn–Pb) with r values 0.881, 0.809, and 0.781 were observed. Results
signified that each paired heavy metal had common contamination sources,
that is, traffic in this study. On the other hand, variation in their r values could be due to the fact that their generation
was from different sources within the traffic. However, physicochemical
properties and metal associations were not analyzed in the present
study, to help in ascertaining these results. The analysis revealed
that heavy metals had affected the speed hump microenvironments.

Pb	–0.802a	0.809a	0.781a	1	
a Correlation is significant at the
0.01 level (2-tailed).

One-way
ANOVA was performed to test the overall influence of the
distance from speed humps on heavy metal concentration. On detection
of significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) between
the mean concentrations at varying distances from speed humps, Tukey’s
honestly significant difference (HSD) test was performed. Tukey’s
HSD was performed to identify the variation pattern between the distances
for their heavy metal concentrations. Tukey’s HSD analysis
showed homogeneity in Cu concentration at 1–3 and 3–5
m, whereas significant difference in the mean concentration was observed
at a 5–10 m distance. Tukey’s HSD analysis showed homogeneity
in Pb concentration in road soil collected at 1–5 and 3–10
m, whereas significant difference in the mean concentration was observed
at a 10–50 m distance. The analysis showed a homogeneity in
Zn concentration at distances 1–3, 3–5, and 5–10
m, whereas significant variations in mean concentrations were observed
at 10–50 and 50–200 m. Data analysis for heavy metal
concentrations at different distances at speed humps showed that the
contamination of heavy metals indicated less variation upto 10 m distance.

Proposed New Traffic Calming Device for Developing Countries
The new design focused on avoiding mechanical disturbances to the
vehicles in low-traffic regions without affecting its target speed
reduction. Without simplicity and low costs there will never be any large scale use. The driving behavior to navigate
over the unpaved surface at speed humps may be avoided by implementation
of vertical structures in the estimated hotspot zone and providing
wheel cut-outs (Figure 8) (longitudinal gap provided to allow vehicles to avoid traveling
over the vertical hump) of width slightly greater than that of wheels
of different vehicle types. It is expected here that these wheel cut-outs
may turn the heterogeneous type traffic (characteristics of city traffic
mainly in developing countries) into homogenous type and also allow
unimpeded passage by emergency vehicles. Provision to warn drivers
of the presence of speed hump by posting suitable advance warning
sign should be placed 40 m before the speed hump. Speed limit imposition
combined with traffic law enforcement is one of the best ways to make
vehicles slow down. Studies in many countries have indicated that
the introduction of speed limits often has only a short-term effect
in reducing speeds unless police regularly enforce the limits.38 Posted speed limits alone will not guarantee
compliance. It is only when backed up by strict police enforcement
that speed limits reduce speed. Furthermore, it should be painted
with luminous and alternate color bands. Regular cleaning of this
traffic calming device may increase its performance level as well.
After some new traffic calming device’s design implementation
like this, one can gradually build up a general design for developing
countries.

Figure 8 Proposed traffic calming device with the wheel cut-out provision
for different vehicle class.

Limitations of the Proposed New Traffic Calming Device
The
proposed calming device has its limitations, and it may affect
the traffic in very crowded roads. The proposed traffic calming device
considers only the emission reduction as the area of concern and not
the other parameters concerned with flow of traffic. This proposed
traffic calming device may perform well in low-trafficked arterial
roads as well as in urban roads of developing countries like India,
prevailing mixed traffic and where the average speed itself has been
reported to be lesser than that of other developed countries. For
example, Adak et al. developed emission factors of three major vehicle
types: two wheelers, three wheelers, and four wheelers for Dhanbad,
India, using real-world driving cycle.19 They have reported the average speeds of these three types of vehicles
to be 27.8, 13.4, and 17.4 km h–1, respectively,
which is much lower than the designed speed for the roads. In another
study, real-world vehicle emission was observed to vary with the corresponding
driving cycle of the country used for regulatory purpose.39 They have reported that the road driving occurred
at lower average speeds with higher frequency and magnitudes of accelerations.
Moreover, in India, for speed breakers, the preferred advisory crossing
speed of 25 km h–1 was also specified in the guidelines
of IRC 99 (1996).40 Furthermore, the effect
of the proposed traffic calming device on traffic flow in different
cities of developing countries may vary with their respective traffic
characteristics. Therefore, a performance study of the proposed traffic
calming device can be conducted to examine its effect on traffic flow.

Existing Mitigation Techniques
The proposed design
for new traffic calming device could turn into a useful alterative
for the identified hotspot by its implementation along with the existing
measures.

Improving the Environment of Speed Humps
by Washing
The vehicle-emitted heavy metal buildup can accumulate
(do not degrade
with time) on road surfaces and roadside soil, and hence it contributes
in air, soil, and water pollution.41−45 A provision to wash off the paved road contaminated
surface at an area nearby speed humps may provide the immediate and
cost-effective solution to remove the heavy metals from road surfaces.
It was assumed in this study that regular cleaning of road dust buildup
at this speed hump hotspot with water may bring about a significant
improvement to environment by removing entrained particles at the
hotspot zone. The study attempted for washing of leaves nearby pollution
sources showed significant decrease in heavy metal’s impact
on plants.46 However, as the hotspot zone
is identified, control of the resuspension process could diminish
the further contamination to produce better and promising results.

In previous published studies, suitable analytical parameters were
identified for road surface cleaning, runoff waters, etc.47,48 Researchers have recognized that wash-off is influenced by water
intensity, duration, and runoff volume.47,48 Furthermore,
buildup contaminant’s wash-off from the road surface was usually
analyzed using exponential
equations.46 Considering these parameters
to wash off at speed hump hotspots may play a better role in this
process. In general, water quality models like storm water management
model (SWMM) use a constant value of k. The value
of k is site-specific and may vary with the road
soil type, rainfall intensity, catchment area, and catchment slope.49−51 A constant value was reported to perform notably well in the estimation
process, and use of a constant value of k had reduced
the wash-off equation’s complexity.52 Similarly, for speed humps, the best possible values of k may produce reliable results using the theory of least
squares to replicate the observed wash-off patterns by providing water
jets of calculated flow rate, amount, and duration.

Additional
Parameters To Improve Road Environment at Speed Humps
Road
gradient was reported as another important parameter in road
surface cleaning or runoff simulation studies.44 The water jets could be drained passively from water outlet
nozzles, placed at a relatively higher road grade, to the other end
along with the heavy metals removed from that zone for that particular
period. The contaminated water can be collected in storage tanks for
its treatment by the filtration process with a provision to recycle
it back to the upper end using pumps. Filter strips, swales, infiltration
trenches, filter drains, and soakways for road surface runoff treatment
have been studied for car parking runoff.51 Furthermore, pollutants at speed humps could be removed through
mechanisms adopted by previous researchers in laboratories, such as
filtration, adsorption, sedimentation, and biological uptake factors affecting the phenomenon was also important in terms of pollutant
mass transport in road dust cleaning.53 In addition to this, different paving materials having a higher
advection property at roads with environmental pollution
may also be used to reduce its pollutant load.54

The findings of this study encourage the environmentalists,
planners, and strategy makers in the developing countries to implement
immediate alternatives to not only remove but also avoid continuously
increasing traffic-emitted toxic heavy metals and their long-term
persistence nearby traffic calming speed humps. Therefore, the proposed
new traffic calming device, especially nearby sensitive locations
in cities, such as schools, hospitals, residential areas, and minor
roads, prone to higher accidental cases, may act as an efficient and
a low-cost alternate to this existing environmental concern without
affecting its safety aspects. Furthermore, effective monitoring with
a detailed study on the performance of the proposed traffic calming
device is necessary.

Materials and Methods
Sample Collection
Road soil was collected following
the method described by Fujiwara et al.55 Samples were collected at speed humps along the road (sides 1 and
2) and intersections in urban roads (Figure 9). To study the environmental effects caused
by speed humps, road soils were collected from the sampling sites
at distances of 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 50, 100, and 200 m from the speed
humps.

Figure 9 Study sites for collection of road soil at speed humps and traffic
intersections in Dhanbad, India (Map source: Wikimapia.org).

The concentration of heavy metals
Cu, Zn, and Pb was determined
in the collected samples. These three selected heavy metals are well-known
markers of traffic-associated emission. Cu, Zn, and Pb in soil were
reported to be generated from brake wear, tire wear, and exhaust,
respectively.21,32−34

Chemicals and
Reagents
Digestion of road soil samples
for heavy metal analysis was done using the method described by Ogundele
et al.56 Road soil samples were air-dried,
then crushed with a clean dry mortar and pestle, and then sieved through
a 2 mm sieve to make it fine. Sieved samples, weighed 3 g, were then
digested with a mixture of 10 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid
and 3.3 mL of concentrated nitric acid. For better mixing, they were
left overnight.57,58 Distilled water was added to
the digested sample, and then the sample was filtered with a Whatman No. 42 filter, pore size 2.5 μm,
and topped upto 20 mL volumetric flask with distilled water.56 The solutions were transferred into sampling
bottles for analysis.

The infiltrates were examined for metal
concentration level from their acid extracts using atomic absorption
spectrophotometer (AAS) (GBC Avanta PM, Australia) at wavelengths,
λ, Cu = 324.8 nm, Zn = 213.9 nm, and Pb = 217.0 nm, using air
acetylene flame. Standard Reference Materials (AccuTrace, AccuStandard
Inc.; Matrix 2–5% HNO3; CRM uncertainty ± 5%;
verified against NIST SRM# 3128 for Pb; 3168 for Zn; and 3114 for
Cu) were used for the preparation and calibration of each analytical
batch.

Evaluation Method
To interpret and assess the contamination
status for heavy metals in collected samples, several indices, such
as CF, PLI, mCd, Igeo, and RI, were estimated using eqs 5–10. The level of heavy metal contaminations with respect to its corresponding
values in native soil before industrialization took place can be expressed
by the CF. Hence, CF is the ratio of the concentration of heavy metal
in the sample to that in its corresponding background.37 It is an effective tool for monitoring the pollution
over a period of time and defined as 5  where Cn is the
concentration of heavy metal “n” in
the sample and Bn is the concentration
of heavy metal “n” in the background.
The contamination levels were classified by Hakanson59 based on their intensities on a scale ranging from 1 to
6, as presented in Table 2. The highest number indicates that the metal concentration
is 100 times greater than what it could be expected in the earth crust.59,60

Table 2 Interpretation of Heavy Metal Contamination
Using Contamination Factor (CF)59
CF	contamination level	
0	none	
1	none to medium	
2	moderate	
3	moderate
to strong	
4	strong	
5	strong to very strong	
6	very strong	
Using the CF values estimated for heavy metals,
other four indices (PLI,
mCd, Igeo, and RI) were estimated. The PLI was proposed by Tomlinson
et al.61 It provides some understanding
about the measure of a component in the particular environment. PLI
for each site was evaluated as indicated by 6  where N is the total number
of heavy metals analyzed (three in the present study) and CF is the
contamination factor.62−64 Zero PLI value indicates perfection, a value of one
indicates the presence of only baseline levels of heavy metals, and
values above one would indicate progressive deterioration of the analyzed
site.60,64,65

Another
contamination identifying index mCd was also used to examine
the contamination in road soil by heavy metals and was calculated
based on the equation provided by Abrahim and Parker66 7  where CF is the contamination
factor, N is number of heavy metals in the study,
and mCd is the
modified and generalized form of the degree of contamination (Cd)
proposed by Hakanson.59 It is calculated
by summing all individual contamination factors and defined as 8  where CF is the contamination factor, N is the total number of heavy metals analyzed (three in
the present study), and Cd is the degree of contamination. Abraham
and Parker66 have reported that this generalized
formula allows the incorporation of several heavy metals without the
restraint of an upper limit. The mCd may be classified into different
classes, which are presented in Table 3.

Table 3 Interpretation of Heavy Metal Contamination
Using Modified Degree of Contamination (mCd)66
ranges	significance	
mCd < 1.5	nil to very low degree of contamination	
1.5 ≤ mCd <2	low degree of contamination	
2 ≤ mCd <4	moderate degree
of contamination	
4 ≤ mCd <8	high degree of contamination	
8 ≤ mCd <16	very high degree of contamination	
16 ≤ mCd <32	extremely high degree of contamination	
mCd ≥ 32	ultrahigh
degree of contamination	
Pollution levels of heavy metals around speed humps
could be characterized
by the Igeo. This method has been used by Müller for several
heavy metal studies throughout the world.62 It is computed using the following equation 9  where Cn is the
measured concentration of individual heavy metal in the sample and Bn is the background value of individual heavy
metal. The control samples were taken to represent the background,
and 1.5 is the unvarying factor. Table 4 represents seven classes of Igeo as proposed by Müller.67

classes	description	
Igeo < 0	practically
uncontaminated	
0–1	uncontaminated to slightly contaminated	
1–2	moderately contaminated	
2–3	moderately to highly contaminated	
3–4	highly
contaminated	
4–5	highly to very highly contaminated	
Igeo > 5	very
highly/strongly contaminated	
Hakanson59 provided the
ecological risk
index (RI), which integrates the factors of ecological risk potentials
(Er) for each heavy metal and associates their ecological and environmental
effects with their toxicology.68 Its calculation
is done as 10  where Cfi corresponds to the pollution factor for individual
heavy metals, C0-1i corresponds to heavy
metal’s concentration
in the sample, Cni is the background
concentration, Eri is the ecological risk
potential of the heavy metals, Tri is
the toxic response coefficient developed by Hakanson59 (toxic response coefficients for Cu = 5, Zn = 1, and Pb
= 5), and RI is the ecological risk index. The interpretation categories
for RI are presented in Table 5.

Risk, and Ecological Risk Index59

Statistical Analysis
To determine statistical parameters
and for further analysis of data for its quality, one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) and Spearman ρ correlation analysis were
conducted using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) of IBM
Statistics version 21.0.
