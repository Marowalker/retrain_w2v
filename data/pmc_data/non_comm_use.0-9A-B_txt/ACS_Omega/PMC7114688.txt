An environmental
strategy for developing sustainable materials
presents an attractive prospect for wastewater remediation. Herein,
a facile, green, and economical strategy is proposed to fabricate
magnetic composite nanoparticles (NPs) toward cationic dye adsorption
and selective degradation. To prepare the composite TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs, tannic acid (TA) and polyethyleneimine
(PEI) were first used to decorate Fe3O4 NPs
at aqueous solution, and then TiO2 NPs were anchored onto
the surfaces of Fe3O4 NPs based on the catecholamine
chemistry. The chemical composition and microstructure of the obtained
NPs were systematically characterized. The NPs not only exhibited
adsorption ability for the cationic dye of methylene blue (MB) but
also responded to ultraviolet light to selectively degrade the adsorbed
MB, and the removal (adsorption and/or degradation) ratio for MB could
reach 95%. In addition, cyclic experiments showed that the removal
ratio of the composite NPs for MB could still be maintained more than
85% even after five cycles. Given by the above-mentioned advantages,
such a green and facile strategy for combining the adsorption and
degradation methods to construct magnetic nanocomposites exhibits
potential applications in cationic dye selective removal and sustainable
wastewater remediation.

Introduction
Water is an extremely
valuable natural resource for maintaining
a stable natural environment, meeting the basic needs of life and
promoting the development of the human society.1 However, water pollution reduces the use value and even
does harm to human health.2 Dyes account
for a large proportion of organic pollutants in water environment.
In practice, both the produced and applied processes of dyes will
cause the dye enter the water environment and then pollute the water
body. The environmental pollution by dyes would induce carcinogenicity
(such as dyes of benzidine series),3 change
the water color which hinders the penetration of sunlight in water
and weakens the photosynthesis of aquatic organisms,4 consume oxygen while dyes are decomposed by microorganisms
and result in anoxic water body, and affect the growth of aquatic
animals and plants.5 Meanwhile, most dyes
can cause irritation to human skin and mucosa, have influences on
the respiratory system, and even cause cancer.6−8 Thus, developing
efficient and convenient methods to deal with dyes in wastewater has
gained worldwide attention.

There have been many studies relating
to sewage treatment. Owing
to the easy operation and simple design, the adsorption method to
deal with wastewater has been widely used.9−11 Song et al.
fabricated amino-coated particles which exhibited diverse adsorption
capacities to Congo red, Cu2+, and bilirubin.12 Xu et al. took advantages of the surface migration
strategy of functional groups to fabricate an ultrafast adsorption
nanofibrous membrane for removing organic dyes.13 When these materials are reused, acid, alkali, and other
organic solvents are often added for the desorption of dyes from the
adsorbents, and the acidic or alkaline wastewater still needs to be
treated.14,15 Thus, if adsorbents can be reused without
adding other reagents, it will have greater potential for application
in sustainable wastewater treatment.

Another method for sewage
treatment is to decompose toxic substances
into harmless compounds directly.16 Semiconductor
photocatalysts are widely used to decompose dyes,17−19 and many semiconductor
materials, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), zinc sulfide
(ZnS), and zinc oxide (ZnO), have been reported to degrade complex
chemicals, especially dyes.20,21 Possessing ideal properties
such as nontoxicity and low cost and displaying a photocatalytic activity
under the irradiation of ultraviolet light (UV light),22−24 TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) also have the
ability to decompose dyes into soluble nontoxic ions and small molecules.25 Thanks to the large specific surface area, TiO2 NPs have been studied in the field of water treatment.26,27 However, the separation of TiO2 NPs from the water is
too cumbersome, limiting the application of TiO2 NPs in
commercial or industrial water treatment.28 Many researches have been reported on the immobilization of TiO2 NPs onto the surfaces of silicon wafers, glasses, films,
and other macroscopic materials;29−31 however, the immobilization
will reduce the useable area of TiO2 NPs. Furthermore,
the recycling processes, such as filtration and centrifugation, require
complex operations and postprocessing.32,33 The other
way is synthesizing magnetic TiO2 NPs which contain magnetic
cores, and the obtained composite NPs can be simply separated from
suspensions by magnetic fields.34

Fe3O4 NPs have attracted much attention because
of their outstanding magnetic property, low toxicity, and high chemical
stability.35 Based on Fe3O4 NPs and TiO2 NPs, magnetic composites have also
been studied. Liu et al. prepared Fe3O4/TiO2/C nanocomposites, which could catalyze the decomposition
of H2O2 and the subsequently generated radicals
could almost completely oxidize methylene blue (MB).36 In this study, TiO2 NPs were precipitated onto
Fe3O4 cores via the hydrolysis of titanium salt.
For loading TiO2 NPs onto the insulated carbon surface
of the magnetic core (Fe3O4/C), Aghamali et
al. employed a vapor phase hydrolysis method.37 Liu et al. prepared multifunctional composite microspheres with
spinel Fe3O4 cores and anatase TiO2 shells by combining the solvothermal reaction and calcination process.38 In these studies, Fe3O4 NPs and TiO2 NPs were obtained through heat treatment
or hydrolysis processes, and high temperature (450 °C) was needed.

Based on the catecholamine chemistry, polyphenol and its derivatives
have been shown to adhere onto a variety of material surfaces through
a simple one-step process, such as 2D or 3D porous materials’
superhydrophobic or superoleophobic surfaces, and this method has
been identified as green surface chemistry.39−41 More importantly,
the catecholamine layer shows intrinsic chemical reactivity because
of the existence of catechol quinone moieties and catechol radical
species.42 Recently, tannic acid (TA) has
been investigated as a functional natural material for surface/interface
modification owing to the high content of catechol/pyrogallol groups,43,44 and the catechol/pyrogallol groups made TA negatively charged. By
cooperating with FeIII, TA could adhere easily on multi
interfaces within 20 s for post-functionalization.45 Liu et al. modified the oxidized graphene surface with
TA as the reducing agent and capping agent to change the physicochemical
properties of the graphene surface and improve the adsorption efficiency
for rhodamine via the intensive π–π stacking interaction
and electrostatic attraction.46 Kim et
al. used iron(III) and TA coordination chemistry to modify the surface
of polydopamine (PDA); poly(ethylene glycol) was fixed on the surface
of PDA via the hydrogen bond interaction with TA, and then the decorated
PDA was fixed on the surfaces of stainless steel and nylon to inhibit
the adhesion of diatoms for marine antifouling applications.47

Herein, based on the catecholamine chemistry,
we anticipated employing
a facile, green, economical, and energy-saving method to prepare magnetic
composite NPs. Cationic dyes would be adsorbed on the surface of the
NPs by TA and then degraded by TiO2 NPs. The magnetic composite
NPs could be recycled by a magnetic field. Thus, the composite NPs
have self-cleaning, reusable abilities. In this study, Fe3O4 NPs were employed as the cores of composite NPs. TA
and polyethyleneimine (PEI) were employed to decorate the Fe3O4 NPs at room temperature, and TiO2 NPs were
anchored onto the surface of the Fe3O4 NP core
to prepare composite TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs. The compositions of the obtained composite NPs were characterized
using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy-dispersive spectroscopy
(EDS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The microstructure
was investigated via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Besides, a
vibrating sample magnetometer was used to test its magnetic properties.
Furthermore, the adsorption and degradation abilities for dyes were
systematically studied, and the recycle property was also investigated.

Experimental
Section
Preparation of TA@Fe3O4 NPs
Fe3O4 NPs were immersed in aqueous TA solution for
5 min with shaking. Then, the NPs were transferred into aqueous FeCl3 solution and shaken for another 5 min. After that, the obtained
NPs were washed several times with deionized (DI) water and named
TA@Fe3O4 NPs.

Preparation of PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs
TA@Fe3O4 NPs
were immersed into a PEI phosphate-buffered
solution (pH = 8.5). After shaking overnight, the obtained NPs were
washed several times with DI water and named PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs.

Preparation of TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs
PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs were added to
a suspension of TiO2 NPs. After shaking for 12 h, the NPs
were washed several times with DI water to remove the unstable TiO2. Finally, the magnetite composite TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs were obtained.

The obtained NPs were
characterized and used for the dye removal experiment. Materials,
preparation, and characterization of methods, dye adsorption experiments,
and degradation experiments are all supplied in the Supporting Information.

Results and Discussion
Preparation
and Characterizations of TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs
To prepare the UV and magnetic
dual-responsive TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs, TA molecules with a high content of catechol/pyrogallol groups
were first coated onto the surface of the pure Fe3O4 NPs through the strong interaction between the FeIII–TA complex and the material surface,48,49 and then the amino group-enriched PEI molecules were further introduced
to form a stable functional layer via the Schiff-based reaction and
Michael addition between TA and PEI,50−52 as shown in Figure 1a, and the obtained
samples were named PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs. Finally,
the target TiO2 NPs were anchored onto the surfaces of
PEI-modified TA@Fe3O4 NPs,53 and the obtained composite NPs were named TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs.

preparation route of TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs. (b–d) TEM images of Fe3O4, PEI-TA@Fe3O4, and TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs. (e) High-resolution scanning
TEM elemental mapping images for TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs. (f) Powder XRD patterns, (g) FTIR, and (h) XPS
wide spectra of TiO2, Fe3O4, PEI-TA@Fe3O4, and TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs, respectively.

The morphologies for the as-prepared magnetic NPs were observed
by TEM and SEM, as shown in Figures 1b and S1. The pure Fe3O4 NPs presented the average diameter of around
100 nm and a clear single-layer structure. After being modified with
TA and PEI, a remarkable shell layer (around 5 nm in thickness) on
the surface of Fe3O4 NPs is observed, as shown
in Figure 1c. For TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs, as shown in Figure 1d, high-resolution
TEM images further disclose the NP-anchored structure such that many
grain-shaped particles with an average diameter of around 25 nm were
aggregated onto the surface, which were consistent with the SEM results.
Moreover, elemental mapping analysis as presented in Figure 1e provided direct evidence
to confirm the introduction of TiO2 NPs, where Ti and N
elements were distributed onto the surface, whereas the Fe element
was only probed in the core. Furthermore, the lattice spacing of 0.356
nm corresponded to the (101) plane of the anatase TiO2,54 whereas the lattice spacing of 0.245 nm corresponded
to the (004) plane of anatase TiO2.55 The planes were also detected by XRD, as shown in Figure 1f. The obvious diffraction
peaks for Fe3O4, PEI-TA@Fe3O4, and TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs
at 2θ = 30.1, 35.5, 43.2, and 57.0° were ascribed to the
(220), (311), (400), and (511) planes of Fe3O4, respectively. The diffraction peaks for TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs at 2θ = 25.3, 38.0, 47.9, 54.2, and
68.9° were ascribed to the (101), (004), (200), (211), and (116)
planes of TiO2 NPs, respectively.56 The results revealed that the original phases of Fe3O4 and TiO2 within composite NPs were not changed
after coating.

To further verify the chemical structures and
detailed composition
of these magnetic Fe3O4 NPs, FTIR, XPS, EDS,
and zeta potential tests were performed. As shown in Figure 1g, in contrast to the original
Fe3O4 NPs, three peaks were observed on the
spectra of PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs and TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs. These three peaks at 475,
584, as well as 2920 and 2979 cm–1 were ascribed
to Ti–O bond vibration from TiO2 NPs,37 Fe–O stretching vibration from Fe3O4 NPs, and the −CH2–
stretching vibration from PEI, respectively. Moreover, the Fe, N,
and Ti signals were probed from the XPS survey scan, as shown in Figure 1h. As expected, the
Fe 2p peak was observed on Fe3O4, PEI-TA@Fe3O4, and TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4, while the N 1s peak was observed only for PEI-TA@Fe3O4 and TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs, ascribed to the introduced PEI. After anchoring TiO2 NPs, the Ti 2p and Ti 2s peaks were probed only on TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs. The estimated content
of the Ti element in TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs was 16.8 at. %, as listed in Table S1. Furthermore, in the Ti 2p spectra, two characteristic peaks of
TiO2 located at 458.3 and 464.0 eV36 were probed for TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs in Figure 2a.
The corresponding Fe 2p spectra of TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs are presented in Figure S2; Fe atoms were composed of Fe3+ and Fe2+,
which were provided by Fe3O4 and FeCl3. Meanwhile, the high-resolution XPS O 1s spectra in Figure 2b can be fitted to three peaks
(Fe–O, C–O, −OH)57,58 for TA@Fe3O4 NPs and PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs,
while only two peaks could be probed on the pure Fe3O4 NPs: Fe–O group (529.4 eV) and surface hydroxyl (−OH,
530.5 eV) groups. Furthermore, in contrast to Fe3O4 and PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs, the Ti signal
was probed for TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs
by the EDS pattern, as shown in Figures 2c and S3. The
corresponding element contents determined by the EDS pattern are provided
in Figure 2d, which
was consistent with the result estimated by XPS analysis. Overall,
these results indicated the successful preparation of TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs.

and (e) hysteresis loops of Fe3O4, PEI-TA@Fe3O4, and TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs. (f) Zeta potential for Fe3O4,

Furthermore, to investigate the recyclability by
magnetism of TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs,
the hysteresis loop
tests were performed. As shown in Figure 2e, both Fe3O4 and TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs presented little hysteresis,
coercivity, and remanence, which suggested that Fe3O4 and TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs
were superparamagnetic. The saturation magnetization of Fe3O4 NPs was 68.24 emu/g; however, the saturation magnetization
of TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs was 46.54
emu/g, and the decrease was caused by the nonmagnetic TiO2 NPs. Nevertheless, the magnetism of TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs was still high enough for separation.59 As shown in the inserted picture, TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs could be conveniently separated
from solution through a magnet, which made it possible to reuse the
magnetic composite NPs after being used for dye removal in wastewater.

Additionally, the preparation of TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs was monitored by the zeta potential measurement,
as shown in Figure 2f. In contrast to the raw Fe3O4 NPs with a
zeta potential of around +12.3 mV, the zeta potential of TA@Fe3O4 NPs was found to be −28.8 mV. As expected,
PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs exhibited a positive zeta potential
(+25.3 mV), which was attributed to the introduction of the amino
group-enriched PEI molecules. Importantly, TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs had a negative zeta potential of around
−12.1 mV, which has better affinity toward cationic dye molecules
than anionic dye molecules. This contributed to the capture of cationic
dyes and further degradation for wastewater remediation.

Single Dye
Removal
As mentioned above, TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs presented a negative zeta
potential; thus, the NPs should have better affinity and higher removal
ability toward cationic dyes than anionic dyes, as illustrated in Figure 3a. To verify this
view, the different single dyes including three kinds of cationic
dyes [methyl violet (MV), rhodamine B (RhB), and MB] and two kinds
of anionic dyes [methyl orange (MO) and amaranth (AR)] were utilized
to investigate the removal properties of TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs. When the adsorption of dyes reached the
equilibrium in the dark, all the test vessels were irradiated by the
UV light and TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs
were excited to degrade the dyes. As shown in Figure 3b, TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs presented 95, 66, 36, 10, and 5% removal ratios toward
MB, MV, RhB, AR, and MO, respectively, which confirmed the higher
removal ability of TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs toward cationic dyes than anionic dyes. The result was further
confirmed by the color change of the dye solution such that the color
of the single MB solution changed from deep blue to colorless, while
that for the single MO solution was basically unchanged, as shown
in the inserted image. The corresponding UV–vis spectra variations
are provided in Figure 3c,d. Obviously, TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs had more significant removal ability toward the cationic dye
MB than the anionic dye MO. As a control, the pure TiO2 NPs were also used to remove all the above-mentioned dyes under
UV light, and the corresponding UV monitoring spectra are shown in Figure S4. The pure TiO2 NPs presented
90, 78, 73, 86, and 74% removal ratios toward MB, RhB, MV, AR, and
MO, respectively. There was no clear difference in affinity between
the cationic and anionic dyes by the pure TiO2 NPs under
UV light. These results demonstrated that TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs had higher removal ability toward the cationic
dyes than the anionic dyes.

and anionic dye removal

and under UV light. UV–vis spectra of the (c) MB and (d) MO
solutions before and after being UV-treated at different times, respectively.
(e) Removal ratios toward MB removal in the dark and under UV light
by different magnetic NPs. (The initial concentrations of the above-used
dye solutions were 50 μmol/L.)

Moreover, the removal ratios toward MB by different magnetic NPs
in the dark and under UV light were also investigated. In the dark,
the samples only had adsorption ability but would present degradation
property toward the dyes under UV light. To confirm this, as shown
in Figures 3e and S5, the adsorption and degradation capacities
of MB by different NPs were studied, respectively. Among these magnetic
NPs, TA@Fe3O4 NPs presented the highest adsorption
ability with the removal ratio as high as 94% toward MB in the dark.
However, the removal ratio of TA@Fe3O4 NPs was
nearly zero under UV light, indicating that TA@Fe3O4 NPs had no degradation ability. In contrast, TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs presented the highest removal
ratio up to 71% under UV light, which demonstrated that the dye removal
by the magnetic NPs was mainly attributed to the loaded TiO2 NPs.

The above phenomenon could be explained as follows: as
seen from
the zeta potential data, TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs presented a negatively charged surface, which presented
a high adsorption ability toward the cationic dye MB because of the
charge attraction; after reaching the adsorption equilibrium, the
degradation ability of TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs dominated. The mechanism for the degradation of organic
dyes by the TiO2 NPs has been reported in many literature
studies,60−62 and the mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of
MB by TiO2 is shown in the Supporting Information. TiO2 can absorb photons and be excited
to produce a series of free radicals under UV light. The organic dyes
(MB) are either attacked by hydroxyl radicals or degraded after being
trapped and oxidized by holes directly.63 The degradation mechanism of the composite magnetic NPs is shown
in Figure 4a. The produced
electrons were reacted with holes onto the surface of TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs, and the molecules of the
cationic dye gathered around the magnetic particles, which were easier
to be degraded, leading to the high removal ratio toward dyes. For
comparison, the removal ability toward MB by TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs with different formulations was also studied,
and the results are shown in Table S2 and Figure S6. Figure S6a shows that the amount of TiO2 is a key element for the
removal efficiency. With the increase of the TiO2 NP content,
the removal efficiency toward MB increased. Especially when the Fe3O4/TiO2 molar ratio decreased to 1:1
(or 1:3), the removal ratio increased to over 95%. However, as shown
in Figure S6b, when very high TiO2 ratio was used (as the Fe3O4/TiO2 ratio was 1:3), compared to that with the ratio of 1:1, the reusability
was weakened.

of (c) Langmuir and (d) Freundlich isotherm models; applications of
(e) pseudo-first-order and (f) pseudo-second-order at different initial
MB concentrations; and (g) calculated parameters of kinetic models
for MB adsorption.

As a control, the adsorption
behavior toward MB by TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs was systematically studied
in the dark. As shown in Figure 4b, the adsorption capacity was increased with the increase
of MB concentration because of the stronger mass-transfer force at
a high concentration. It was also suggested that the equilibration
time increased at higher concentration, and all the adsorption reached
the equilibrium within 2 h. Moreover, regardless of the concentration,
the adsorption rate in the initial stage was faster. This phenomenon
could be explained by the fact that much more vacant adsorbent sites
and a stronger mass-transfer driving force existed at the initial
stage.64 Moreover, the Langmuir and Freundlich
isotherm models were employed to study the equilibrium data, and the
detailed equations and parameters are provided in the Supporting Information. Figure 4c,d shows that the adsorption data fitted
well with both the Langmuir adsorption isotherm and Freundlich adsorption
isotherm. Therefore, the adsorption process is a monolayer adsorption
process. Furthermore, the adsorption processes of TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs toward MB were analyzed by pseudo-first-order
and pseudo-second-order kinetic models, and the detailed equations
and parameters are presented in the Supporting Information. The linear plots of different models are shown
in Figure 4e,f. According
to the linear equations, the constants were calculated from the slope
and intercept. The r2 values of the pseudo-second-order
kinetic model were all higher than 0.99 as summarized in Figure 4g, which indicated
that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model was more suitable to the
experimental data.

Binary Dye Removal
To investigate
the removal behavior
of TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs toward mixed
dyes (cationic dye and anionic dye), the above-mentioned degradation
procedures were performed using the mixed solution of MB/MO and MB/MV.
As a control, as shown in Figure 5a, the pure TiO2 NPs presented 77 and 67%
removal ratios toward MB and MO, respectively. For TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs, as shown in Figure 5b, after being adsorbed and
exposed to UV light for 12 h, the color of the MB/MO mixed dye solution
changed from green to yellow, which was almost the same as that of
the single MO solution. Seen from the corresponding UV–vis
spectra of the MB/MO solutions before and after UV light irradiation,
the peak of the maximum UV absorption wavelength of MB gradually disappeared
under UV irradiation, while the maximum UV absorption wavelength of
MO did not change significantly. The removal ratios for MB and MO
were 92 and 4%, respectively. It suggested that the cationic dye MB
was selectively adsorbed and degraded by TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs, while the anionic dye MO was barely removed.
Furthermore, the adsorption and degradation behaviors toward the cationic/cationic
mixed dye of MB/MV were also investigated by TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs. As shown in Figure 5c, the removal ratios toward MB and MV were
as high as 58 and 53%, respectively, which suggested that TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs presented adsorption
and degradation properties for both MB and MV. These results demonstrated
that TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs had selective
degradation ability only toward cationic dyes for the cationic/anionic
mixed dye solution and no selective degradation ability for the same
charged mixed dye solution.

Different from the separation
by the dye molecule size as reported
by Ran et al.,65 the difference in charges
of the dyes is the main cause of selective degradation in our study,
as illustrated in Figure 5d. The removal ratio toward MB by TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs was a combined result of adsorption and
degradation, and TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs have the selective degradation ability toward cationic dyes.

To investigate the photocatalytic degradation behavior, TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs were first immersed
into the MB solution (50 μmol/L) in the dark until the adsorption
equilibrium was reached. Then, the adsorbed-TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs were moved into different concentrations
(20, 50, 100 μmol/L) of MB solutions under UV light for degradation
experiments. As shown in Figure 5e, the concentration of MB solution decreased with
time under UV light. In this process, TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs acted as the photocatalyst, catalyzing the
degradation of MB. The degradation process of TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs was analyzed by fitting with the Langmuir–Hinshelwood
equation as follows 1  where CDo (μmol/L)
is the concentration of MB before degradation and CDt represents the concentration of MB
at different time intervals and kD represents
the rate constant of degradation (h–1). The fitting
curves of Langmuir–Hinshelwood of the degradation process are
presented in Figure 5f; and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Figure 5g. The kD value reflected the catalytic efficiency, and with the increase
of concentration, the kD value decreased.
With the increase of concentration, the r2 increased, and when the concentration was 100 μmol/L, the r2 was 0.99. The results demonstrated that the
MB degradation behavior by TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs fitted well with the Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic
model.

Recyclability
The stability and recyclability of composite
magnetic NPs are very important parameters for wastewater treatment
in practical application. The removal ability toward different concentrations
of MB solutions by TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 was investigated. For each concentration, TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs were used to adsorb MB in the dark for 2
h first, and then the test vessels were irradiated by UV light. As
shown in Figure 6a,
the removal ratios by UV degradation were significantly increased
with the illumination time. Subsequently, TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs were collected through a magnet and could
be separated from the dye solutions, as shown in Figure 6b. The collected NPs were reused
for adsorbing and degrading again. This process was repeated for five
cycles, and the cycled-TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs were detected by XRD. Considering the adsorption time
and catalytic efficiency, 50 μmol/L of MB solution was chosen
for the cycle experiments. As presented in Figures 6c and S7, the
removal ratio toward MB was still up to 85% after five cycles of adsorption
and degradation. The diffraction peaks for the cycled-TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs matched well with the initial
sample, which confirms the stability of TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs. These results demonstrated the good recyclability
of TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs.

ratios of TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs toward
different concentrations of MB solutions; (b)
schematic illustration of the recyclability of TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs; and (c) removal ratios of five cycles toward
MB (50 μmol/L).

Many researchers have
been working on the methodology of adsorption,
followed by photodegradation to produce materials with selective removal
property to dyes. Here, some of the studies are compared. Table 1 shows the status
of these studies, and Table S3 displays
the cost parameters.

Some advantages of TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs cannot be ignored: (1) industrial commodities
are used to prepare
target products in mild conditions, avoiding the complicated preparatory
process; (2) commercial TiO2 NPs are cheap, and the power
of the UV lamp is much lower than that of the solar simulator, which
can avoid more energy consumption; (3) taking advantage of magnetic
composite NPs for recycling rather than for filtration or centrifugation,
TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs have the potential
for large-scale use.

Conclusions
In this study, TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs were prepared through
a polyphenol-inspired, facile, environmental-friendly,
and economical method. Fe3O4 NPs acted as the
cores, endowing the composite NPs with magnetic property and recyclability;
TiO2 NPs acted as photocatalysts to degrade dyes; polyphenol
coating was employed to combine two inorganic NPs together for the
removal of cationic dyes. The removal ratio of TiO2-PEI-TA@Fe3O4 NPs toward MB, which included adsorption and
degradation, could reach 95% and remained 85% even after five cycles.
Owing to the adsorption ability, the NPs could selectively degrade
the cationic dyes in the cationic and anionic mixed solution. Meanwhile,
the degradation of MB eliminated the needs of acids, bases, or other
organic substances to desorb MB, so troublesome post-processing could
be avoided in adsorbent recovery, and it is anticipated that the NPs
could have a great potential for cationic removal in wastewater treatment.
