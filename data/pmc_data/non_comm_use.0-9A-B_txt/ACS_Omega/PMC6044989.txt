Burn, trauma, and various medical
conditions including bacterial
infection, diabetes complication, and surgery could lead to an acute
cutaneous wound and scar formation. Application of tissue glues instead
of sutures could minimize the additional trauma and scar formation.
Despite the countless efforts devoted to the development of high-strength
tissue glues, little attention has been paid to their influence on
the scar formation. Here, we report the development of a new tissue
glue with excellent biocompatibility and tunable degradability for
scarless wound closure. A series of catechol-containing poly(amidoamine)
(CPAA) polymers were synthesized via the one-step Michael addition
of dopamine and bisacrylamide. The tertiary amino group in the polymer
backbone was used to introduce a zwitterionic sulfobetaine group by
one-step ring-opening polymerization. The introduction of the zwitterionic
sulfobetaine group could easily tune the hydrophilicity and the degradability
of CPAA without influencing the density of the catechol group in the
polymer. Lap-shear tests on the porcine skin demonstrated a high adhesion
strength of 7 kPa at 1 h, rising to 24 kPa by 12 h. Addition of silica
nanoparticles could further enhance the adhesion strength by 50%.
In vivo studies further confirmed that the CPAA tissue glue could
effectively accelerate the healing process of incisional wounds on
the back of Sprague Dawley rats compared with suture and reduce the
scar formation.

Introduction
Every year, millions
of patients need a proper wound closure procedure
to enable healing, and a large proportion of them eventually acquire
scars.1 Scar is a dysregulated response
to cutaneous wound healing, including excessive proliferation of fibroblasts
and abnormal deposition of collagen. Scar formation goes beyond aesthetics,
disfigurement, or movement restriction, sometimes even leading to
cancer.2,3 Numerous research efforts have been made
for scarless wound healing; application of tissue glues is one promising
strategy.4,5 Compared with the traditional wound closure
techniques of using sutures and staples, tissue glues provide faster
wound closure, no additional trauma, less inflammation, and reduced
scar formation.6−13 The reduced scar length and morbidity make this technology particularly
appealing in cosmetic surgeries, such as facelift surgery.14,15 Cyanoacrylate is the first kind of commercialized tissue glues that
could rapidly polymerize on contact with water or blood. However,
the cyanoacrylate glue fails to gain widespread popularity because
of its variable outcome and tissue toxicity.16 Besides cyanoacrylate, tissue glues based on fibrin are also commercially
available. Although they have the advantages of fast curing and biodegradability,
the use of fibrin glues of human origin encompasses risks of blood-borne
disease transmission and potential allergic reactions.17

In recent years, it is found that some
marine organisms including
barnacles and marine mussels show the ability of affixing themselves
to virtually all types of surfaces under aqueous conditions. The strong
adhesive property of mussel proteins comes from the unusual amino
acid 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). Through oxidative cross-linking
or metal chelation, the catechol moiety in DOPA could form a strong
adhesive layer between various surfaces.18−20 To mimic this
natural adhesive, many kinds of polymers carrying catechol groups
have been developed, including polypeptides,21,22 polyacrylates,23−25 poly(ethylene glycol)s (PEGs),26−28 poly(ester
urea)s,29 polyurethane,30 and polystyrene-based systems.31−34 Becker et al.29 have synthesized poly(ester urea)s by interfacial polymerization,
and the catechol groups were introduced via 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
condensation between the phenol group and the acetonide-protected
3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic acid. These polymers show a strong adhesive
strength which is comparable to the commercialized fibrin glue on
the porcine skin. Messersmith et al.35−38 have developed multiple tissue
adhesive systems. One of the most successful systems is the four-arm
PEG end-capped with catechol groups. It achieves high adhesive strength,
low toxicity in vitro, and excellent wound closure ability in vivo.

However, the influence of the catechol-containing tissue glue on
the scar formation has been studied rarely. The aim of this research
is to develop a biodegradable tissue glue that could achieve safe
and scarless wound closure. Poly(amidoamine) is a class of biodegradable
polymers that have been widely used for biomedical applications because
of their structure similar to that of polypeptide, good biodegradability,
and biocompatibility.39,40 Herein, catechol-containing poly(amidoamine)
(CPAA) and catechol-containing poly(amino ester) (CPAE) were synthesized
through the one-step Michael addition reaction of commercialized monomers.
Because poly(amidoamine) has an inherent tertiary amino group, each
repeating unit could serve as a bifunctional group. Zwitterionic groups
could be introduced into the polymer through the one-step ring-opening
reaction of 1,3-propane sultone without influencing the density of
catechol groups in the polymer. The introduction of highly hydrophilic
zwitterionic sulfobetaine groups could systematically tune the hydrophilicity
and degradation rate of CPAA. CPAA could be used as a tissue glue
after the catechol group was cross-linked by the Fe3+ ion.
Lap-shear tests proved that CPAA had adequate adhesion strength. When
the polymer was applied to the rat skin wound closure, the wound healing
rate was accelerated and the scar formation was reduced compared with
both the suture and the commercialized fibrin glue (see Schemes 1 and 2).

Results and Discussion
Polymer
Synthesis and Characterization
Synthesis of
the catechol-containing polymer is a challenging task. The catechol-containing
monomers are usually made from dopamine that is oxygen-sensitive.
Complicated protection and deprotection steps are required to prevent
the oxidation of dopamine during the reaction and purification processes.15 Although postmodification can be adopted to
prepare catechol-containing polymers, the low reactivity of the amino
group in dopamine makes this approach inefficient.16 The ease of poly(amidoamine) synthesis by polycondensation
should, in principle, facilitate the structure–property elucidation
of bioadhesive polymers. Herein, the one-step Michael addition reaction
was chosen to synthesize CPAA and CPAE.

CPAA and CPAE were synthesized
under similar conditions to compare the influence of the monomer on
the adhesive strength and degradability. PEG diacrylates with different
EG repeating units were chosen to prepare CPAE to study the influence
of the length of diacrylates on their adhesive strength. The aminoamide
and amino ester bond in CPAA and CPAE will also lead to a different
degradability of the tissue glue. The CPAE-1,2 and 3 were using monomer
with 2, 8 and 11 EO units. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis
showed that CPAA and CPAE were synthesized with a molecular weight
ranging from 20 000 to 30 000 (Table 1 and Figure S1). 1H NMR spectra of the purified CPAA and CPAE are depicted
in Figure 1. The successful
incorporation of catechol groups into CPAA and CPAE was confirmed
by the characteristic peaks of the catechol group at 6.45 and 6.65
ppm, respectively. In CPAA, the peaks at around 2.2, 2.5, and 4.3
ppm were attributed to the methylene protons of N,N′-methylene bis(acrylamide) (Figure 1A). In CPAE, the peaks at around
3.5, 3.6, and 4.1 ppm were attributed to the methylene protons of
PEG in the PEG diacrylate (Figure 1B–D).

The hydrophilicity of polymers determines the number of water molecules
bounded to the polymers. An increase of hydrophilicity would facilitate
the access of water molecules to the polymer backbone, resulting in
accelerated hydrolysis of the polymer. The introduction of a hydrophilic
group into the polymer could potentially tune its degradation rate.
The zwitterionic sulfobetaine group with a strong water-binding ability41 was chosen to augment the hydrophilicity of
polymers in this study. The tertiary amine groups could be used to
introduce the zwitterionic sulfobetaine groups by the one-step ring-opening
reaction. A series of CPAA-ZS with different hydrophilicities was
synthesized through the ring-opening reaction between CPAA and 1,3-propane
sultone (Table 2).
In addition, the reaction conversion could be controlled through adjusting
the reaction time and the molar ratio of 1,3-propane sultone to tertiary
amine. The conversion was determined by the characteristic peak of
the methylene group in the zwitterionic sulfobetaine at 2.1 ppm (Figure S2).

Adhesion Strength of Polymers with Different Cross-linking Densities
and Hydrophilicities
Catechol groups can form stable linkages
by introducing the cross-linker, FeCl3, to the system.
However, the optimal molar ratio of catechol groups to FeCl3 needs to be investigated. Herein, the lap-shear adhesion strength
of CPAA mixed with different amounts of FeCl3 was measured
to investigate the optimal molar ratio of catechol groups to FeCl3 on the porcine skin. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was chosen
to increase the solubility of CPAA because it is widely used in biomedical
applications.42,43 As shown in Figure 2A, when the molar ratio of
CPAA to FeCl3 varied from 10:1 to 10:4, the adhesion strength
first increased from 2.8 kPa (catechol/FeCl3 = 10:1) to
3.9 kPa (catechol/FeCl3 = 10:2) and then decreased to around
2 kPa (catechol/FeCl3 = 10:3 and 10:4). This can be explained
by the competition between catechol and Fe3+: multiple
bidentate complexation and single bidentate complexation.44

amounts
of FeCl3; (B) CPAA, CPAE-1, CPAE-2, and CPAE-3 at a catechol/FeCl3 ratio of 5; (C) CPAA-ZS with different ring-opening efficiencies;
and (D) CPAA tissue glue with a catechol/FeCl3 ratio of
5 blended with 2% of 500 nm silica nanoparticles with different functional
groups on the surface. The error bars represent SD (n = 5), and the statistics are determined by t-test
(*P < 0.05).

Then, the wet adhesion strength properties of CPAA and CPAE
synthesized
by PEG diacrylate with different EG repeating units were investigated.
As shown in Figure 2B, the wet adhesion strength of CPAE was all around 1 kPa, which
was much lower than that of CPAA. This is because the density of the
catechol group in the CPAE backbone is lower than that in CPAA, which
could be attributed to the longer chain length of the PEG diacrylate
than N,N′-methylene bis(acrylamide).
The influence of hydrophilicity, finely tuned by the introduction
of zwitterionic sulfobetaine groups, was also investigated (Figure 2C). Although the
hydrophilicity of the polymer was greatly enhanced after the ring-opening
reaction, the wet adhesion strength was not compromised by the introduction
of zwitterionic sulfobetaine groups in the polymers. When the grafting
ratio reached 21%, the tissue glue showed the highest adhesion strength
(3.4 kPa).

Because the polymer could be adsorbed and adhered
to the surface
of inorganic nanoparticles, the addition of inorganic nanoparticles
was widely used to increase the gel cohesion strength.45 For instance, the addition of Laponite could
significantly increase the adhesion strength and the toughness of
the tissue glue.28 Because of the excellent
biocompatibility and controllable diameter of the silica nanoparticles,
they were chosen as the reinforcing additive.46,47 The influence of the functional groups on the surface of silica
nanoparticles was first investigated. The bare silica nanoparticles
could greatly increase the adhesion strength of the polymers, whereas
silica nanoparticles functionalized with an amino group or a carboxyl
group could not exhibit the same property (Figure 2D). It might be because the surface modification
of silica nanoparticles hindered the access of DOPA to the silica
nanoparticles.

The concentration and the diameter of silica
nanoparticles also
had a significant impact on the reinforcement performance. When the
concentration of silica nanoparticles was increased from 1 to 6%,
the wet adhesion strength first increased and then began to decrease
after culminating at 2%. When the concentration was increased from
0 to 2%, the internal cross-link point increased, so the strength
of the tissue glue increased. However, when the silica nanoparticle
concentration was further increased from 2 to 6%, they could not disperse
well in the tissue glue, and the aggregation of silica nanoparticles
decreased the strength of the tissue adhesive. For 15 nm silica nanoparticles,
the highest concentration they would achieve is 4%. Further increase
of concentration will result in a serious coagulum, so we did not
test the adhesive strength. By comparing the lap-shear adhesion strengths
of the polymers blended with silica nanoparticles with different diameters,
it could be seen from Figure 3A that 500 nm silica nanoparticles performed better than the
15 nm nanoparticles.

concentrations; (B) CPAA (white), CPAA blend with 2% of 500 nm silica
nanoparticles (gray), and fibrin glue (black) at different adhesion
times. The error bars represent SD (n = 3), and the
statistics are determined by t-test (*P < 0.05). (C) storage and (D) loss moduli of the CPAA tissue glue
containing 1 wt % (black) and 2 wt % 15 nm (red) silica nanoparticles
and 1 wt % (pink) and 2 wt % 500 nm (green) silica nanoparticles and
the silica-free CPAA tissue glue (blue) subjected to an oscillatory
strain of 0.1 at a frequency of 0.1–100 Hz.

As shown in Figure 3B, the adhesion strength of the CPAA tissue glue was
comparable with
that of the fibrin glue in the first 4 h. Then, the adhesion strength
of the CPAA tissue glue increased and exhibited a better performance
than the fibrin glue. The adhesive strength of the DOPA-based tissue
adhesive comes from the thiol group in the tissue which could react
with the tissue glue. The longer adhesion time could help more covalent
bond formation between the tissue and the tissue glue, so the adhesive
strength increased with time.

To further understand the influence
of silica nanoparticles in
the bioadhesives, the viscoelastic property of the tissue glue was
determined using oscillatory rheometry (Figure 3C,D). For all formulations tested, the storage
modulus (G′) was greater than the loss modulus
(G″), indicating that the hydrogel was chemically
cross-linked. The CPAA tissue glue without silica nanoparticles showed
70 kPa storage modulus and 30 kPa loss modulus at around 1 Hz. Both
the storage and the loss moduli increased with the frequency. The
addition of 1 wt % silica nanoparticles significantly increased the
loss modulus of the CPAA tissue glue but not the storage modulus.
The increased loss modulus indicated an enhanced viscous dissipation
property, which might be attributed to the presence of reversible
hydrogen bonds between the CPAA polymer and silica nanoparticles in
the hydrogel network. The unchanged storage modulus indicated that
the addition of 1 wt % silica nanoparticles did not change the structure
of the hydrogel network. By contrast, 2 wt % of silica nanoparticles
significantly enhanced both the storage and the loss moduli. Unlike
the adhesion strength, the 15 nm silica nanoparticles displayed higher
storage and loss moduli. This can be explained by the competition
between the silica–catechol interaction and the skin–catechol
interaction. The smaller silica nanoparticles with a larger surface
area would adsorb more catechol groups, which would decrease the number
of active catechol groups for adhesion.

Degradation and Cytotoxicity
of the Polymers
Because
of the influence of nitrogen in the backbone, the amide bonds in the
backbone of poly(amidoamine)s are very vulnerable to degradation in
aqueous solution.48 Because the regeneration
abilities of different organs are quite different, the application
of tissue glues in different organs requires different degradation
rates. A series of tissue glues with a tunable degradation rate could
be an ideal candidate to fulfill the requirement under a variety of
situations. Herein, the degradability of CPAA and CPAA-ZS was evaluated
in vitro at pH = 7.4 and 37 °C for 22 days; the mass loss profiles
are shown in Figure 4. After 22 days, CPAA degraded less than 20% of its original mass.
The introduction of the zwitterionic sulfobetaine accelerated the
degradation, bringing the mass loss to 38 and 57% with 11% (CPAA-ZS-11)
and 21% (CPAA-ZS-21) of sulfobetaine incorporated into the polymer,
respectively, in the same period. Because of the vulnerability of
the amino ester bond in CPAE, all CPAE lost more than 70% weight within
3 days, which makes them not suitable for in vivo applications.

Macrophages are one of the key players in the wound healing
process.
They are responsible for clearing debris, releasing cytokines, and
stimulating fibroblast division, collagen synthesis, and angiogenesis.19 The cytotoxicity of CPAA and CPAA-ZS was evaluated
in the RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage cell line (Figure 5). The cells attached and proliferated on
the substrate coated with CPAA (Figure 5B) or CPAA-ZS (Figure S3).49 The cytotoxicity of the dissolution
content was evaluated by the Transwell system. The Fe3+-cross-linked tissue glue (30 μL) made from CPAA or CPAA-ZS
was put into the Transwell chamber and cocultured with the RAW 264.7
cells for 24 h. No cytotoxicity was detected, which proves that the
introduction of zwitterionic sulfobetaine did not affect the cytotoxicity.

In Vivo Cutaneous Incisional Wound Healing Study
The
cutaneous incisional wound healing model50 was used to evaluate the in vivo performance of the CPAA tissue
glue. The wound healing process could be divided into four overlapping
but well-defined phases: hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation,
and remodeling and scar formation. The perfect tissue glue should
be able to achieve immediate wound closure and hemostasis, reduce
the wound healing time, and minimize the scar formation. During the
animal study, the CPAA tissue glue or fibrin glue was applied to the
wound openings on the dorsum of Sprague Dawley rats after cleaning
the blood. In the control group, the wounds were closed by sutures.
The morphological examination of the CPAA glue, fibrin glue, and suture
groups is shown in Figure 6. Application of the fibrin glue and the CPAA glue could achieve
both wound closure and hemostasis. On day 14, the fibrin glue and
the CPAA glue exhibited a similar wound recovery, outperforming the
suture group. On day 21, the wounds in the CPAA glue group almost
fully recovered, whereas the wound scar could be clearly seen in the
fibrin glue group and the suture group. On day 28, all groups showed
full recovery of the wound, and the CPAA glue group showed a lower
degree of scar formation compared with the fibrin glue group.

Figure 6 Morphological
comparison of fibrin glue, CPAA glue, and suture
in the Sprague Dawley rat model; the scale bar is 0.3 cm.

Detailed wound healing process analysis was performed
on day 28
through hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. For normal wound
healing, day 28 should be the end of the proliferative phase and in
the middle of remodeling and scar formation process. H&E staining
(Figure 7A) showed
severe immune cell infiltration in the suture-treated group, whereas
the CPAA glue and fibrin glue both showed little immune cell infiltration
(Figure 7B,C). The
area of underlying scar tissue of the CPAA glue-treated group (0.13
± 0.00 mm2) is much smaller than those of the other
two groups at day 28 (suture-treated group: 0.83 ± 0.01 mm2 and fibrin glue-treated group: 0.24 ± 0.02 mm2; Figure 7G). Masson’s
trichrome staining and analysis was applied to depict collagen deposition
and organization in the incisional wound area. Whereas the collagen
fibers in the suture-treated group and the fibrin glue-treated group
were still in an admixed packed state (Figure 7D,E), more organized collagen (brighter blue)
fibers were present in the CPAA glue-treated group at day 28 (Figure 7F). During the remodeling
phase, the collagen reorganization and degradation occur simultaneously
to provide tensile strength and reduce scar formation. Quantitative
image analysis (Figure 7H) demonstrated that the intensity of collagen deposition in the
CPAA glue-treated group (0.30 ± 0.02) was significantly lower
than those in the suture-treated group (0.44 ± 0.02) and the
fibrin glue-treated group (0.42 ± 0.02) (P <
0.05). These in vivo results indicated that the application of the
CPAA glue led to a scarless wound closure in the cutaneous incisional
wound model.

Conclusions
A
new type of mussel-inspired biodegradable CPAA polymer adhesives
was synthesized using the one-step Michael addition reaction. CPAA
exhibited low cytotoxicity, controlled degradability, and reasonable
wet tissue adhesion strength in vitro. The comparison between CPAA
and CPAE indicated that the high adhesion strength of CPAA may be
due to the higher catechol density in the CPAA backbone. Blending
with silica nanoparticles could further enhance its adhesion strength.
The introduction of zwitterionic sulfobetaine groups by the ring-opening
reaction could tune the hydrophilicity and degradation rate of polymers
without jeopardizing their adhesion performance. In vivo studies further
proved that the CPAA glue could achieve efficient wound closure, which
was characterized by accelerated wound healing and decreased scar
formation. With the advantageous adhesion strength, tunable degradability,
and promising performance in the in vivo wound healing rat model,
the CPAA-based biomimetic adhesive might provide a new clinical option
for wound closure in which scar formation is the primary consideration
such as in cosmetic surgery.

Aesar), sodium bromide (99%, Alfa Aesar), and other chemicals were
used as received. Silica nanoparticles were purchased from Aladdin.
A commercialized fibrin tissue adhesive was purchased from Shanghai
Raas Blood Products Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). In cell culture, Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) was obtained from Corning. Fetal
bovine serum (FBS), penicillin/streptomycin (pen/strep), and phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, pH 7.4) were obtained from Gibco BRL.

Synthesis of
CPAA and CPAE Polymers via the Michael Addition
Reaction
As a general procedure, N,N′-methylene bis(acrylamide) (1.54 g, 10 mmol), triethylamine
(4 mL), and DMSO (10 mL) were discharged into a 50 mL Schlenk flask.
The mixture was degassed by two freeze–evacuate–thaw
cycles, and then dopamine hydrochloride (1.96 g, 10 mmol) was discharged
into the Schlenk flask. The mixture was further degassed by three
evacuate–thaw cycles, and the Schlenk flask was sealed. Polymerization
was carried out in an oil bath thermostated at 50 °C for 5 d.
After polymerization, the solution was distilled under vacuum to remove
the excess DMSO. For CPAA, the resulting product was purified by dialysis
in water for 3 d, and then a light yellow solid was obtained after
lyophilization (yield: 88%). For CPAE, the resulting product was purified
by precipitating it into diethyl ether three times.

Synthesis of
CPAA-ZS via the Ring-Opening Reaction of 1,3-Propane
Sultone
In a 25 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic
stir bar, CPAA (0.7 g), 1,3-propane sultone (0.8 g), and sodium bromide
(0.08 g) were stirred to dissolve in 10 mL of dimethyl formamide (DMF).
The solution was stirred at 45 °C for 45 h. Then, the solution
was concentrated by a rotary evaporator before precipitating it two
times in tetrahydrofuran. The resulting product was purified by dialysis
in water for 2 d, and a white powder was obtained after lyophilization.
The composition was determined by the 1H NMR spectrum.

Characterization
1H NMR spectra were recorded
on a Bruker AVANCE III 400-NMR spectrometer at room temperature. SEC
was performed by a set of an Agilent 1260 pump, an Agilent 1260 refractometer,
and three PLgel columns (mixed-D, mixed-D, and mixed-B) using DMF
as an eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL·min–1 at 35 °C. Polystyrene standards were used for calibration.

Adhesion Strength Measurement
Lap-shear tensile stress
measurements were performed on the porcine skin following the procedures
described in ASTM standard F2255-05. Fresh porcine skin was obtained
from the slaughterhouse and then stocked at −20 °C before
use. A small piece of the thawed porcine skin was cut into rectangular
pieces with dimensions of 5.0 cm × 1.5 cm after removing excess
fat, and then these pieces were immersed in PBS (pH = 7.4) for immediate
use. Tissue glues were prepared by adding 20 μL of FeCl3 solution into 20 μL of 30 wt % polymer solutions in
DMSO with different concentrations at pH = 8.5. The mixtures were
treated with ultrasound for 20 min. Then, the tissue glues were smeared
between two partially overlapped porcine skins with an overlapping
area of 2 cm × 1 cm. The adhesive joints were compressed with
2.5 kPa pressure for 5 min. Then, the adhesive joints were pulled
at a rate of 5 mm·min–1 until the two porcine
skins were separated, using a floor-standing electromechanical universal
testing machine (SUNS UTM5000 Series, Shenzhen, China). Each measurement
was repeated five times and averaged.

Dynamic Rheological Tests
Dynamic rheological tests
of the CPAA tissue glue were carried out at room temperature using
a Rheometric Scientific HAAKE (Thermo Fisher Scientific) strain-controlled
rheometer equipped with 35 mm parallel plates. The storage modulus
(G′) and the loss tangent (the ratio of loss
modulus G″ to storage modulus G′) of the tissue glue were determined at the frequency ranging
from 0.1 to 100 Hz at 0.1 strain amplitude. All rheological measurements
were performed in triplicate.

Degradation Study
Degradation was assessed by the percentage
of weight loss over a period of 1 month. The CPAA polymer was prepared
in a 7 mL glass vial (each empty glass vial was weighed) and immersed
in PBS (pH = 7.4) in an incubator at 37 °C. At regular intervals,
after removing PBS and washing the CPAA polymer with distilled water,
the vial with CPAA was dried and weighed again. The overall mass loss
was calculated by deducting the recorded empty vial weight from the
final mass values.

The CPAA-ZS polymers were dissolved in 3
mL of deionized water and transferred into a dialysis bag (molecular
weight cutoff = 1000). Then, the polymer was dialyzed at 37 °C
for 22 d. Then, the solution was freeze-dried to get the remaining
polymer, and the weight was recorded. Each polymer was tested three
times.

Cell Culture and Cytotoxicity Study in Vitro
The cytotoxicity
of the dissolution content of the tissue glue was measured using a
quantitative MTT assay. RAW 264.6 mouse macrophages were cultured
in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 10 units·mL–1 pen/strep at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere.
Cells were seeded in a 24 well-plate at a concentration of 40 000
cells per well for 24 h. The tissue glue (30 μL) was added into
the Transwell chamber. The cells cultured in DMEM were set as a control.
After incubation for 24 h, the Transwell chamber and the medium were
removed and replaced with 50 μL of MTT solution (1 mg·mL–1 in PBS), and the cells were incubated for another
4 h. Finally, the MTT solution was removed, and 100 μL of DMSO
was added per well to dissolve the crystals completely. The absorbance
of each well at 570 nm was measured using a Multiskan FC microplate
reader (Thermo Fisher, USA). For the microscopy image of RAW 264.7,
first, a solution of CPAA or CPAA-ZS in the Tris buffer (pH = 8.5,
2 mg·mL–1) was added into the 24 well-plate
and coated for 24 h. After the solution was removed, the polymers
were coated on the bottom of the plate. Then, the cells were seeded
and cultured for 24 h before taking the image.

Animal Study for Incisional
Wound Closure
All in vivo
experiments and animal care were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the Sun Yat-sen University ([2014] C-031).
To evaluate the tissue glue property and the biocompatibility of the
CPAA tissue adhesive, rats (normal Sprague Dawley rat, 180–220
g, 3 months, male) were randomly divided into three groups, five rats
in each group. The rats were anesthetized using an isoflurane–oxygen
gas mixture, and fur around the surgery site was removed. Skin incisions
(1.5 cm long and full skin thickness deep) were made on their back.
The skin incisions were quickly closed by the interrupted suture,
fibrin glue, and CPAA glue. The CPAA tissue glue (50 μL) was
applied to the wound area, and the wound was pressed by tweezers for
1 min. At 28 days after wound closure, the incisions and the surrounding
normal skin were harvested and fixed in p-formaldehyde
solution (3.7 wt %) for histological analysis by H&E staining
and Masson’s trichrome staining. Measurements of scar areas
and collagen index in high-power field were performed by ImageJ software.51,52
