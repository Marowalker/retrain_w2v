Efficient
and large-scale removal of humic acid (HA) from aqueous
environments is required since HA causes human health and esthetic
issues. Hydro-garnet compounds, Ca3Al2(SiO4)3–x(OH)4x, have recently been suggested as HA adsorbents not only due
to their superior adsorption behaviors but also because they are ubiquitous
element-derived compounds. In this study, the adsorption behavior
of formic acid to hydro-garnets was investigated by means of first-principles
density functional theory (DFT) computations. Formic acid was chosen
owing to its reasonable computational cost and inclusion of carboxylic
acid as HA. Comparisons of adsorption energies for formic acid among
various compounds (including platinum and kaolinite) indicate that
hydro-garnet compounds are promising due to their lower (more stable)
adsorption energies. Also, the optimization of composition x enables selective adsorption of formic acid against solvent
water molecules. Relationships between surface electronic/atomistic
structures and adsorption properties are discussed.

Introduction
Humic acid (HA) is
a mixture of various organic molecules consisting
of a motif of aromatic nuclei with phenolic and carboxylic substituents.
In aqueous environments, HA is produced by biodegradation of dead
organisms and is a water pollutant. For example, harmful trihalomethanes
are generated through chlorination of HA compounds.1,2 Therefore,
HA removal from water is required at water purification plants to
prevent human health issues. Also, small amounts of HA contamination
in water cause brown coloring. Thus, HA causes health and esthetic
issues,3,4 and efficient, low-cost, large-scale, and
complete removal of HA is highly demanded for water purification.

Several methods, such as membrane separation and coagulation techniques,
have been suggested to remove HA.5,6 Adsorption
of HA onto inorganic substrates is also promising. Indeed, activated
carbon (which is used as an adsorbent for various materials in water
purification plants) also shows high HA adsorption performance.7 Libbrecht et al. demonstrated an improvement
of HA adsorption by controlling the pore size of carbon.8 Oxides, such as kaolinite, also show HA adsorption
properties.9 We have recently suggested
the use of hydro-garnet compounds, Ca3Al2(SiO4)3–x(OH)4x, as an HA adsorbent, where this material shows superior adsorption
performance compared to kaolinite or zeolite.10 Furthermore, these compounds are composed only of ubiquitous elements,
which potentially satisfies the conditions of low cost and large scale
for installing water purification plants. Hydro-garnets are also byproducts
of autoclaved cement production.11 Lacivita
et al. indicated the existence of a miscibility gap using density
functional theory (DFT) calculations,12 while we reported a wide range of compositions controlled by autoclaved
synthesis.13

In this study, the organic
and/or water molecule adsorption behavior
of hydro-garnet compounds was investigated to acquire fundamental
knowledge on the adsorption mechanism and materials design to optimize
the HA adsorption performance. First-principles DFT calculations were
adopted to evaluate quantitative thermodynamics and the electron/molecular-level
adsorption mechanism. Instead of HA, formic acid (HCOOH) adsorption
properties were investigated in this study, since the molecular size
of HA molecules is too large to compute adsorption using the DFT technique
(number-average molecular weight is >10 00014). As HA contains carboxylic substituents, knowledge in
formic acid adsorption behavior aids in designing materials for HA
adsorption. Particular attention was paid to the compositional dependence
of the hydro-garnet adsorbent, to understand the role of surface functional
groups such as Si–O(H) and Al–O(H). Also, the adsorption
properties of kaolinite and platinum substrates as control compounds
were evaluated.

Methods
First, relaxed structure
calculations were performed for the bulk
structures of a series of hydro-garnet compounds, Ca3Al2(SiO4)3–x(OH)4x (where x = 0, 0.5, 1.5,
2.5, and 3), using DFT. Both the ends of the composition are known
as grossular (x = 0) and katoite (x = 3). Ca and Al ions are located at the dodecahedral and octahedral
sites, respectively. The tetrahedral cavities are occupied by Si or
H ions. We adopted the special quasi-random (SQS) technique15 to determine the Si and H arrangement for the
intermediate composition (0.5 < x < 2.5), due
to the numerous arrangements of Si and H inside the tetrahedral cavities.
In detail, we only considered pair interactions, and the Monte Carlo
approach was used for SQS structure search, as the nearest-neighbor
(NN) coordination number distribution derived from this approach renders
randomly configured cation–cation interactions. The constraint
that the interatomic distance between Si and H was longer than 1.4
Å due to strong Coulombic repulsion was applied for the SQS structure
search. DFT computations for the above structure models were performed
using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PBEsol)16,17 using the plane-wave basis set and the projector-augmented wave
(PAW) method as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package
(VASP).18,19 The kinetic energy cutoff was set as 500
eV, and a 2 × 2 × 2 k-point mesh was applied.

After determining the cubic lattice parameters of hydro-garnets,
the surface structures were computed using the slab technique, in
which a set of infinite layers separated by vacuum layers are repeated
periodically along the surface normal. Low-index facets of the (001),
(011), and (111) surfaces with various terminations were targeted
in this study, as reported previously.13 In this study, charge-balanced stoichiometric slabs were treated
by adjusting the number of surface atoms. A total of six termination
models for each composition (i.e., total 30 structure models for 5
compositions) were constructed as follows: Ca- and CaAlSi-terminated
{001} surfaces, CaSi- and Al-terminated {011} surfaces, and CaSi-
and Al-terminated {111} surfaces (see the Supporting Information; Figure S1). Surface structure relaxations were
carried out using the DFT technique as for the bulk model, except
for the condition that the k-point mesh along the c-axis (normal to the slab layer) was unity.

Formic
acid (HCOOH) adsorption reactions onto three compositions
(x = 0, 1.5, and 3.0) in Ca3Al2(SiO4)3–x(OH)4x were performed using DFT-based first-principles
molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations. The initial structure models
were inputted as the HCOOH molecules were placed at the vacuum layer.
The cutoff energy was set to 420 eV, and a 1 × 1 × 1 k-point grid (only Γ point) was employed to reduce
the computational cost. The difference in the total electron energy
was <4 meV atom–1, which was obtained by comparing
the structure relaxation calculation settings described above (500
eV in cutoff energy and 2 × 2 × 2 k-point
grid). The time step was set to 1 fs, and our FPMD simulations were
carried out in the canonical (NVT) ensemble, in which
the amount of substance (N), volume (V), and temperature (T) are conserved, using a Nosé
thermostat20 at 298 K, until the energy
of the system became stable (after 20–40 ps). We also computed
structure models without any adsorbate or with H2O (solvent)
molecules as adsorbates. Likewise, adsorption reaction calculations
onto the other substrates (platinum metal [Pt] and kaolinite [Al4Si4O10(OH)8] surfaces) were
performed for comparison purposes.

Results and Discussion
The calculated cubic lattice parameters for bulk Ca3Al2(SiO4)3–x(OH)4x (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) are plotted in Figure 1. The compounds obey Vegard’s law, as the lattice
parameter increases linearly with composition x.
Also, the results are in accordance with experimental observations.

of the calculated cubic lattice parameter of hydro-garnets
as a function of composition x in Ca3Al2(SiO4)3–x(OH)4x.

Table 1 and Figure 2 show the calculated
surface energies of various low-index facets. In general, the surface
energies are monotonically decreased (stabilized) with composition x regardless of the facets, indicating that the surface
of Si-rich compounds is more reactive. We infer that H+ stabilizes the dangling bonds of oxide ions at the top surface. Figure 3a displays the optimized
particle morphologies for various compositions, and Figure 3b shows the ratio of facets’
area. The Wulff construction was used to estimate the particle morphology,
in which the distance to the central point {hkl}
from the origin was taken to be proportional to the surface energy.21 At x = 0, the {001} and {111}
facets were dominant, whereas {001} and {110} became more significant
for the composition x > 0. Hence, introducing
H+ largely stabilized the {110} facets with respect to
the {111}
facets.

Due to limitations in computational resources, FPMD calculations
were only conducted for the selected facets and composition x, as described below. Since the {100} surfaces commonly
appeared for all of the compositions, as well as small surface energy
changes attributed to facets and terminations (Table 1 and Figure 2), we focused solely on the {100} facet, hereinafter,
for studies on the adsorption of formic acids and H2O molecules.
Moreover, three adsorbent compositions (i.e., x =
0, 1.5, and 3.0) were selected for the FPMD studies to account for
monotonic surface energy changes as a function of composition x (Figure 2). The lowest surface energy terminations (i.e., CaSi- (x = 0 and 1.5) or Ca-terminated (x = 3) facets) were chosen for the {100} facets of each composition
model. Formic acid (HCOOH) or H2O adsorption onto the {100}
facets was simulated by FPMD calculations at 298 K. Due to the limitations
in computational resources and composition-dependent surface energy
monotonic changes (Figures 2 and S2), the adsorbate molecules
were adsorbed on the slab (adsorbent) surfaces within 20 ps at 298
K in this study. It was also confirmed that no molecules were released
to the vacuum layer after the 20 ps MD run. The adsorption reaction
and the adsorption energies (Eads) are
as follows 1  and 2  where S, M, and n are solid-state
adsorbent, adsorbate molecules, and the number of adsorbates, respectively;
θ and A correspond to surface coverage and
surface area in the model; and E[X] stands for the averaged total electronic energy of compound X for the last 5 ps of MD calculations. Note that surface
coverage is defined as the area occupancy of adsorbed molecules against
the total surface area of the corresponding slab model, A. Figure 4a displays the variation
of adsorption energies of formic acid as a function of surface coverage,
θ, onto hydro-garnet {100} facets. The molecular area at the
monolayer for formic acids was set as 37.3 Å2 using
the ChemDraw software package.22,23 The calculated adsorption
energies were abruptly increased (destabilized) at θ > 1,
indicating
a weak interaction between the two adsorbates, which is linked to
multilayer adsorption and strong interactions between the adsorbent
and adsorbate. Figure 4b presents the absorption energy for formic acid or H2O molecules with composition x of hydro-garnet adsorbents
around the surface coverage of 0.5 (four adsorbate molecules in the
slab model). The adsorption energies were reduced with composition x for both the adsorbates, HCOOH and H2O. Therefore,
the introduction of hydroxy units at the hydro-garnet surface reduced
the reactivity with adsorbates. For comparison purpose, the calculated
adsorption energies of formic acid onto the platinum metal or kaolinite
surfaces are also plotted in Figure 4a. We confirmed that the hydro-garnet compounds showed
much larger adsorption energies than kaolinite materials (one of the
candidate adsorbate materials for HA) and comparable energies to platinum
metal surfaces. Hence, the hydro-garnet material is potentially an
attractive adsorbent for formic acid in terms of adsorption energy.
However, as shown in Figure 4b, adsorption energies for solvent H2O molecules
onto hydro-garnets were also large, which may lead to the preferential
adsorption of H2O molecules rather than adsorption of formic
acids. Considering the phase equilibrium based on eq 1, the relationship between adsorption
energy and surface coverage for species Mi can be described
as follows 3  where Ki represents
the equilibrium constant for species Mi; N, R, and T correspond to the total
number of adsorption sites, gas constant, and temperature; and [Mi] is the concentration of species Mi in aqueous
solution. There were three species considered in this study; formic
acid (HCOOH), water molecules (H2O), and vacancy (φ,
only for adsorbent). Considering the site and mass balance 4   5  and 1 ppm
as a concentration of formic acid
([MHCOOH] = 10–6) at 298 K, since HA
is present at dilute concentrations in aqueous environments. The surface
coverage of the three species on hydro-garnets with various compositions x in Ca3Al2(SiO4)3–x(OH)4x was determined
as listed in Table 2. Although there was large adsorption energy of formic acid for the
Ca3Al2(SiO4)3 (x = 0) adsorbent, H2O molecules were preferentially
covered on the hydro-garnet surface due to a larger adsorption energy
of H2O molecules (Figure 4b) and low formic acid concentrations. On the other
hand, hydro-garnet with x = 1.5 showed large coverage
by formic acid due to the relatively smaller (more stable) adsorption
energy of H2O molecules than that of formic acid. Therefore,
the present computation demonstrates that composition optimization
is a useful technique to control the selective adsorption of formic
acid. Hydro-garnet compounds containing Ca3Al2(SiO4)1.31(OH)6.76 (x = 1.31), Ca3Al2(SiO4)0.66(OH)9.37 (x = 0.66), and Ca3Al2(SiO4)0.31(OH)10.76 (x = 0.31) exhibited higher HA adsorption capacity
than the hydro-garnet compound Ca3Al2(SiO4)0.42(OH)10.32 (x =
0.42), which is consistent with the simulation results using formic
acid. Further improvement could be achieved by optimizing composition x based on the computational results described herein.

To clarify the molecular-level adsorption
mechanism, surface atomistic
and electronic structure analyses before and after adsorption were
performed. Figure 5 displays selected snapshots in the vicinity of hydro-garnet surfaces
after adsorption. It was confirmed that all of the formic acids were
dissociated into H+ and HCOO–. H+ ions are prone to bind surface oxygen atoms which are connected
to Si, i.e., −Si–O–H formation (Figure 5a,b). At a composition of x = 3.0 where no Si atoms were present, H+ ions
were bonded with surface OH– forming H2O molecules, and then H2O coordinated on the top of Ca2+ ions (Figure 5d). On the other hand, HCOO– ions interacted with
surface Ca, forming −Ca–OCHO– bonds
(Figure 5b–d).
Similarly, H2O molecules were dissociated into H+ and OH– and formed surface −Si–O–H
and −Ca–OH bonds. Therefore, salt dissociation and acid/base
reactions proceed on the surface of the hydro-garnets.

Numerical values indicate interatomic distances (unit Å). The

carbon, oxygen, silicon, aluminum, and calcium atoms, respectively.

Figure 6 shows contour
plots of the density of states (DOS) for the electronic band against
energy level and z-fractional coordinates (perpendicular
to the slab facets). It was confirmed that the top of the valence
band around the surface was higher than that around the bulk before
the HCOOH adsorption, i.e., band bending at x = 0
(Figure 6a). Also,
the band bending feature was confirmed for the bottom of the conduction
band at x = 0. The band bending feature was reduced
with composition x in Ca3Al2(SiO4)3–x(OH)4x. (Figure 6b,c). Figure 7a,c displays the partial electron density at the top of the valence
band; the energy ranged from −1 to 0 eV vs Fermi level, for
the sample at x = 0 and 3.0, respectively, before
adsorption. The electron density arising from dangling bonds of the
surface O 2p orbitals is clearly visible on the surface oxygen at x = 0 in Figure 7a, whereas electric states corresponding to these dangling
O 2p orbitals were faint due to capping of H+ ions on surface
oxygens at x = 0 (Figure 7c). Therefore, the band bending feature was
diminished with the replacement of Si4+ by H+ with composition x. In other words, a strong electron-donating
property via the dangling O 2p orbital is indicated for the sample
with smaller x in Ca3Al2(SiO4)3–x(OH)4x. Indeed, the band bending characteristics were diminished
after completion of HCOOH or H2O adsorption (Figure 6d), due to the H+ capping on the surface oxygen. Therefore, we infer that bare surface
oxygen sites trigger dissociation of HCOOH or H2O molecules
and the resulting H+ ions are bonded to the dangling O
2p orbital. The trend of band bending characteristics agrees with
changes in the adsorption energy for both HCOOH and H2O
(Figure 4), where the
adsorption energy for both molecules monotonically reduced with composition x. Therefore, the enhancement of salt dissociation by dangling
bonds of O 2p at the surface of hydro-garnet would be a primary reason
for the observed trend in adsorption energy as a function of composition x.

Figure 7 Visualized (a, c), occupied,
and (b, d) unoccupied states around
the Fermi level at the surface of hydro-garnets (yellow-colored isosurfaces).

The dissociated anions (HCOO– or OH–) are also captured on surface Ca2+ ions by electrostatic
interactions or coordination bonding, as shown in Figure 5b–d. Figure 7b,d displays the spatial distribution
of density of states around the bottom of conduction bands (energy
ranges are shown in the figure). The formation of widely spread states
at the surface is visible above Ca2+ and neighboring O2– at the surface in x = 0 (Figure 7b). This is due to
the hybridization between the Ca 4s orbital and the unshared electron
pairs arising from the O 2p orbital. Hence, these unoccupied states
act as electron acceptors, and HCOO– or OH– ions (which possess unshared electron pairs) would interact with
the unoccupied states above the surface Ca2+ ions. This
agrees with the fact that HCOO– adsorbed onto Ca2+ ions as shown in Figure 5b–d. On the other hand, these unoccupied states
were localized at the composition x = 3.0 (Figure 7d) and the corresponding
energy level against the Fermi level largely increased. Since the
unshared pair electrons of surface oxide ions were bonded with H+ ions, hybridization between Ca 4s and O 2p at the surface
was weakened.

The adsorption energy difference between HCOOH
and H2O as a function of composition x appeared rather
complicated, where the H2O adsorption energy was more stable
at the end compositions (x = 0 and 3.0), while HCOOH
was stable at the intermediate composition (x = 1.5).
Indeed, this difference controls the surface coverage of HCOOH adsorption
as listed in Table 2.

One of the factors is that an acid/base dissociation reaction
in
solution is easier in HCOOH (pKa = 3.75)
than in H2O (pKa = 15.7). Therefore,
dissociation-driven proton adsorption of HCOOH may be enhanced even
for compounds with large composition x where there
is no enhancement of H+ dissociation/adsorption due to
no band bending. Another factor is the formation of a coordinate bond
between the bottom of the conduction band of the adsorbent and the
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the anion adsorbate (OH– or HCOO–). Figure 8 presents the HOMO and lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) of three adsorbent surfaces according to
the DFT calculation and electronic potential at the vacuum. The bottom
of the conduction band level and the band gap of the adsorbent increased
with composition x. Since the HCOO– anion has a larger molecular size than OH– and
an electronic resonance structure, the coordinate bonding interaction
of HCOO– was much stronger than OH– with
adsorbents at low composition x. Such effects (acid/base
dissociation and/or coordinate bond formation) are trade-off relationships
which may account for the calculated results that the intermediate
composition of the adsorbent showed superior HCOO– adsorption.

Conclusions
Formic acid or water
adsorption behavior onto the surfaces of hydro-garnet
compounds has been simulated using first-principles DFT-MD techniques.
The results indicated that hydro-garnets show more stable adsorption
(smaller in adsorption energy) of formic acid than kaolinite or platinum
substrates. Thus, hydro-garnets may be promising compounds for HA
adsorption materials.10 Also, the results
suggest the importance of composition optimization for selective adsorption
of formic acid, since HA is present at dilute concentrations in aqueous
environments. The electronic structure analysis of the hydro-garnets
surface revealed compositional changes of band bending at the surfaces,
which may affect acid/base dissociation reactions. Further research
is needed to characterize the dissociation reaction process in more
detail, which could be achieved via the nudged elastic band method24 and blue-moon ensemble techniques25 to assess the free-energy profiles of the reaction.
These findings will aid in the rational design of novel hydro-garnet
compounds as materials for HA adsorption.
