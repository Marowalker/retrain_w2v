The current environmental and potable
water crisis requires technological
advancement to tackle the issues caused by different organic pollutants.
Herein, we report the degradation of organic pollutants such as Congo
Red and acetophenone from aqueous media using visible light irradiation.
To harvest the solar energy for photocatalysis, we fabricated a nanohybrid
system composed of bismuth ferrite nanoparticles with two-dimensional
(2D) MXene sheets, namely, the BiFeO3 (BFO)/Ti3C2 (MXene) nanohybrid, for enhanced photocatalytic activity.
The hybrid BFO/MXene is fabricated using a simple and low-cost double-solvent
solvothermal method. The SEM and TEM images showed that the BFO nanoparticles
are attached onto the surface of 2D MXene sheets. The photocatalytic
degradation achieved by the hybrid is found to be 100% in 42 min for
the organic dye (Congo Red) and 100% for the colorless aqueous pollutant
(acetophenone) in 150 min. The BFO/MXene hybrid system exhibited a
large surface area of 147 m2 g–1 measured
via the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller sorption–desorption
technique, which is found to be the largest among all BFO nanoparticles
and derivatives. The photoluminescence spectra indicate a low electron–hole
recombination rate. Fast and efficient degradation of organic molecules
is caused by two factors: larger surface area and lower electron–hole
recombination rate, which makes the BFO/MXene nanohybrid a highly
efficient photocatalyst and a promising candidate for many future
applications.

1 Introduction
Photocatalysis is a low-cost
and environment-friendly technique
to purify the wastewater from pollutants such as organic dyes, thus
splitting out the compounds to form water molecules and carbon monoxide.
In the past, semiconductors have been widely used as the photocatalysts
to degrade organic dyes owing to the fact that they are not easily
biodegradable.1 For the last decade, TiO2 is used as a photocatalyst; however, its activity is limited
to ultraviolet (UV) light as it has a wider band gap (∼3.2
eV) and lower activity under visible light irradiation. TiO2 due to its photocatalytic nature is also used in water splitting
for the production of hydrogen (H2) but is still impeded
due to its inferior visible light absorption and requirement of doping
with other materials to increase its performance.2 As UV and visible light form 4 and 43% of the solar spectrum,
respectively, it is required to develop materials that could be used
under the visible light spectrum.3−5 For this purpose, bismuth
ferrites are the potential candidates under visible light irradiation
due to them having a narrow band gap.6,7

Bismuth
ferrites (BiFeO3 or BFO) are a family of transition-metal
oxides used in several applications.8−10 At room temperature,
it is a perovskite-type material, which shows multiferroic behavior,11−13 with a 2.01 eV band gap.14,15 According to recent
studies, BFO compounds showed photocatalytic activity to degrade organic
pollutants such as dyes.7,16−18 In a recent report, thermally reduced graphene oxide is used in
solution to absorb the methyl orange dye.19 It has been shown in recent works that the nanocomposites of BiFeO3/graphene and metal co-doped BiFeO3 are highly
efficient for the photocatalytic applications.13,20,21 The reported result showed that the two-dimensional
(2D) materials have better and extraordinary properties because of
their enhanced effects; therefore, they are taken as promising materials
for many applications.22−28 Many 2D materials such as metal chalcogenides,29,30 boron nitride,31 and oxides and hydroxides32,33 are prepared by exfoliating their three-dimensional (3D) structures.

Recently, reported well-synthesized 2D layered materials containing
transition-metal elements with carbide and nitride, also called MXene,
have attracted considerable attention for their carbon-based 2D layered
structures.34−40 They are characterized by the formula Mn+1XnTx (n =
1, 2, 3) where M corresponds to various transition metals like titanium,
chromium, and so on, X corresponds to carbon, nitrogen, and so on,
and the functional groups of MXenes are represented by Tx (OH, O, F).41 The first MXene compound
reported was Ti3C2Tx, and today,
there are 19 more such compounds from the MXene family being synthesized
and many of them have been predicted for various applications using
first-principles calculations.35,38,40,42,43 Recently, Soltani and Lee studied the photodegradation of BiFeO3/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposites and found that
it degrades completely aqueous bisphenol A in 70 min under visible
light irradiation.21 Wang et al. reported
the 100% degradation efficiency for Bi25FeO40/rGO nanocomposites in 180 min under visible light irradiation for
methyl orange.13 Also, Dai et al. have
found only 50% degradation of methyl orange in 6 h, which shows the
very poor photocatalytic efficiency of the BiFeO3/GO nanohybrid.44 Irfan et al. reported the 17% photodegradation
of acetophenone using La3+- and Se4+-doped BFO
nanostructures.45 Many researchers are
working on various metal-doped BiFeO3 materials and their
hybrids with graphene to be used as photocatalysts since the pure
BiFeO3/graphene photocatalysts have reached its efficiency
limit. Therefore, there is a dire need for finding highly efficient
pure BiFeO3-based 2D nanohybrid structures. In an effort
to achieving this, we present here a very highly efficient BiFeO3/Ti3C2Tx–MXene nanohybrid
structure that showed 100% photocatalytic activity within only 42
min for Congo Red dye removal at room temperature. However, no research
has been found on doped BiFeO3/Ti3C2Tx-MXene nanohybrid or composites exhibiting the photocatalytic
degradation of acetophenone because of its difficulty degrading from
solution. Moreover, this work reports the band gap tuning of the proposed
nanohybrid structure up to 1.96 eV, having the largest BET surface
area of 147 m2 g–1 among any BiFeO3 structures or derivatives reported to date.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structure of Doped BFO
Nanoparticles and BFO/MXene
Nanohybrid
The structural analysis was done by X-ray diffraction
(XRD) (XRD, Rigaku 2500, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation. The scan
angle range was 2θ ≈ 5–65° using Cu Kα
radiation operating at a voltage of 40 kV and current of 20 mA. Figure 1a shows the XRD pattern
of the MAX phase (Ti3AlC2) in red and the etched
MAX phase (MXene, Ti3C2Tx) in black
where Tx is the surface terminations (O–, OH–, and F–) on the MXene sheet.40 In Figure 1b, a closer
view of the MXene peaks is shown where three characteristic peaks
are observed at 2θ ≈ 9.7, 19.1, and 39°corresponding
to the (002), (004), and (104) planes, respectively, representing
etched MAX; the decrease in peak intensity showed the crystallinity
loss after the removal of aluminum from the MAX phase, as shown in
SEM images.39,40 The most intense peak in (Ti3C2Tx) is at 2θ ≈ 39°,
which corresponds to the (104) plane as shown in Figure 1b, indicating the etching of
Al from the structure.46,47 In Figure 1c, the X-ray diffraction pattern of pure
BFO nanoparticles is given in blue and that of the BFO/MXene nanohybrid
structure is given in black. The diffraction peaks confirm the perovskite
crystalline structure of pristine BFO, a distorted rhombohedral structure
with the space group R3c. All the
diffraction peaks of BFO are indexed to JCPDS 71-1518 as reported
in the literature.48−51 Along the characteristic peaks of BFO, a small amount of secondary
phase also occurs at 2θ ≈ 27–28°. In non-stoichiometry,
the Bi2O3 volatilization results are well known
and also the secondary phase formation in BFO. The XRD peaks of the impurity phase in this BFO structure match
with the Bi2Fe4O9 phase as shown
in Figure 1c.52−55 The effect of addition of BFO to the MXene sheet can be seen by
the suppressed behavior of peaks where they broadened, became less intense, and slightly shifted
toward higher diffraction angles as shown in Figure 1d. The slight shift of the XRD peaks of the
BFO/MXene nanohybrid along 2θ toward the right as compared to
the peaks of pure BFO might be due to compression of one of the lattice
of the unit cell caused by the addition of BFO to the MXene sheet.54 The doublet sharp peaks at 2θ
≈ 32° attributed to the (104) and (110) planes of BFO shifted to higher angles, which may be due to the fact that
there is stress on the unit cell that causes the decrease of the lattice
constant and interplanar distance; as a result, contraction of the
unit cell volume occurs. However, the structure of the BFO nanoparticles
remains the same, which has a rhombohedral distorted shape with the
space group R3c, as the doublet
peaks are clearly separated even after nanohybrid formation.56 The particle sizes of BFO and BFO/MXene were
calculated by Scherrer’s formula, and they are 45 and 43 nm,
respectively.57 The grain size decreases
due to the decrease of the lattice constant or the lattice distortion
that takes place upon doping or by hybrid formation, which always happens. This reduction in grain
size causes enhancement of the surface-to-volume ratio of the prepared
nanohybrid.20 During lattice parameter
calculation, a similar decreasing trend was observed for the BFO/MXene
nanohybrid to that of pure BFO particles. The calculated values of
lattice parameters a and c decreased
from 4.58 to 4.55 and 7.31 to 7.29 Å, respectively. The measured
values of BFO/MXene have a slight difference compared to the actual
calculated values of BFO; this small difference in lattice parameters
is due to the presence of a minute content of secondary phase.58 The grain size was calculated using Scherrer’s
formula; the reduction in grain size of BFO/MXene compared to BFO
is due to the attachment of the BFO nanoparticles onto the Ti3C2Tx surfaces.

(Ti3AlC2) and MXene

image of peak shifting.

2.2 Morphological
Analysis
The surface
morphology including the shape and size of MXene and the BFO/MXene
nanohybrid was studied using a field emission scanning electron microscope
and a tunneling electron microscope as shown in Figure 2a–f and Figure 2g,h, respectively. The Ti3C2Tx–MXene sheets after etching show partial
splitting due to aluminum removal from the parent Ti3AlC2 compound as seen in Figure 2a,b, forming a multilayer stack of MXene sheets.39,40 The BFO nanoparticles seem to attach onto the MXene surface, indicating
good nanohybrid formation as shown in Figure 2c–f taken at different zooming scales,
that is, 2 μm, 300 nm, 200 nm, and 100 nm, respectively. The
closer view at 100 nm shows that the BFO particles are in nonuniform
round clusters attached to the MXene sheet, forming a porous network
of BFO/MXene. TEM analysis of the BFO/MXene nanohybrid is shown in Figure 2g,h. It can be clearly
seen that the BFO nanoparticles penetrate into the MXene layers and
are adsorbed onto the surface of the MXene sheets, which is in good
agreement with SEM results. The multilayer MXene sheets can be seen
clearly, providing a smooth surface to the BFO nanoparticles. The
particle size from TEM images is estimated using ImageJ software,59 which is ∼25 to 50 nm.

nanohybrids. (g, h) TEM images of BFO/MXene nanohybrids.

2.3 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
The chemical composition and binding energies of the synthesized
nanohybrid are determined using the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) technique. XPS analysis of the BFO/MXene nanohybrid is shown
in Figure 3. Figure 3a shows the survey
spectrum containing the peaks for the following elements: bismuth,
iron, oxygen, titanium, and carbon, which are abbreviated hereafter
as Bi, Fe, O, Ti, and C elements in the BFO/MXene nanohybrid with
their respective binding energies. High-resolution scans were taken
for Bi, Fe, O, Ti, and C and are shown in Figure 3b–f. The high-resolution spectrum
of Bi 4f is shown in Figure 3b, spreading from 157 to 166 eV, having sharp peaks at 158.8
and 164.1 eV, and the spectrum shows the binding energies of two different
states of Bi, which are Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2. According to a report, this implies that Bi has an oxidation state
of 3+.60 In Figure 3c, the high-resolution spectrum of Fe is
discussed, which spreads over a range from 706 to 729 eV. The exact
peaks are measured at 710.8 and 724.3 eV, which are the binding energies
of two states, that is, Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively, which is related to the Fe2+ ions.60−62 The presence of Fe ions causes more oxygen vacancies to form on
BFO’s surface, which further increases the chances of adsorption
of organic species on the surface.63,64 The high-resolution
spectrum of the oxygen O 1s is given in Figure 3d. The binding energy of oxygen ranges from
527 to 534 eV; deconvolution of the oxygen peak was done and fitted
with a Lorentzian–Gaussian curve to further observe the bonding
of the oxygen atom. Three different peaks were found from the curve
deconvolution: the energy peaks were found at 529.7, 531.1, and 532.8
eV, which are attributed to lattice oxygen atoms, hydroxyl oxygen,
and surface adsorbed oxygen species, respectively.65,66 The results of XPS confirm the presence of oxygen and hydroxyl species
on the surface of the BFO/MXene nanohybrid, which helps in the photocatalytic
degradation mechanism; it is a series of redox reactions that occur
on the surface of the materials.67Figure 3e shows the high-resolution
spectrum of Ti 2p, and the peak spreads over 454 to 470 eV, which
is attributed to the Ti bond; the binding energies for Ti 2p peak
at 459.7 and 465.6 eV for Ti(IV) 2p3/2 and Ti(IV) 2p1/2, respectively. The evidence of Ti–O and Ti–C
bonding can be seen from both of the peaks.68,69 The high-resolution spectrum of the carbon C 1s is shown in Figure 3f; there is a single
peak at 284.7 eV, which can be deconvoluted if required into two peaks
for the C–C and C–O bonds.22,68 Thus, elemental bonds present in the synthesized nanohybrid structure
at specific binding energies confirm the successful formation of the
BFO/MXene nanohybrid.

2.4 Band Gap Engineering
The absorption
spectra of pure BFO nanoparticles and the BFO/MXene nanohybrid were
obtained using a UV–vis spectrophotometer. The well-established
Kubelka–Munk technique is used to estimate the absorption spectra
of both samples.70,71 It is well known from this theory
that the relation between the absorption coefficient α and the
photon energy hυ for the allowed transitions
is 1  

In eq 1, A is a constant
function, Eg is the band gap energy, hν is the frequency times Planck’s constant,
and n is a positive integer.

The optical absorption
spectra for pure BFO nanoparticles and the
BFO/MXene nanohybrid are measured at room temperature between the
wavelength range of 350–700 nm as shown in Figure 4a. A sudden characteristic
peak of pure BFO nanoparticles is observed at around 599 nm.71 To calculate the band gap for pure BFO nanoparticles
and the BFO/MXene nanohybrid, the Tauc plot method is used as shown
in Figure 4b.72,73 A clear red shift is observed in the absorption spectra for the
BFO/MXene nanohybrid compared to the pure BFO nanoparticles. The calculated
band gap from the Tauc plot for pure BFO nanoparticles at direct band
transition is 2.01 eV, which agreed well with the previous reports.7,74,75 The calculated band gap for BFO/MXene
is 1.96 eV, and there is slight reduction in the band gap, as shown
in Figure 4b, which
indicates that the produced nanohybrid is better suitable for photocatalytic
application than its pure BFO counterpart.

Figure 4 (a) Diffuse reflectance
spectrum (DRS) for BFO and the BFO/MXene
nanohybrid. (b) Tauc plot for band gap calculation. (c) Photoluminescence
spectra (PL) of BFO and the BFO/MXene nanohybrid.

Figure 4c shows
the photoluminescence spectra (PL) of pure BFO nanoparticles and the
BFO/MXene nanohybrid. The PL intensity shows the recombination rate
of the charge carries, and BFO shows a higher peak than the BFO/MXene
nanohybrid, which means that the charge recombination rate for BFO
is much higher than that of the BFO/MXene nanohybrid.

Once light
is irradiated on the nanohybrid, electron–hole
pairs are produced, which in the case of attached MXene surfaces are
allowed to spread on MXene surfaces quickly, which may cause delay
for recombination of charge carriers.

The phenomena of excitation
occur for the BFO nanoparticles when
light is irradiated, and the valence band (VB) electrons from a low
energy level jump to the conduction band (CB). The CB in semiconductors
has more than one energy band as explained in detail by Liqiang et
al., which is because the photoluminescence mechanism in the semiconductors
is complex, and their work also relates the PL intensity to the photocatalytic
activity.76 The nanohybrid when activated
with light produces electron–hole pairs, and in aqueous media,
the electron–hole pairs react to form radicals on the surface
of the BFO/MXene nanohybrid.

In Figure 5a, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface area calculation is made using a multipoint BET method. It
confirms that the material is mesoporous in nature.77 The pore sizes are found to be ∼1.68 to 2.47 nm
using the Barret–Joyner–Halenda method, as shown in Figure 5b.78 The BFO/MXene nanohybrid in the produced system showed
the highest reported BET surface area of ∼147 m2 g–1. Thus, understanding the effect of a larger
surface area, two benefits can be attributed to it: the generated
charge carriers reside over the surface of MXene sheets for a longer
time, thus causing a lower recombination rate for the BFO/MXene nanohybrid
than for the bare BFO nanoparticles, and a larger surface area provides
more active sites for redox reactions to occur, which in turn improves
the dye degradation process.79

77 K. (b) Pore volume vs pore diameter.

2.5 Photocatalytic Activity of Pure BFO and BFO/MXene
Figure 6a shows
the absorbance spectra of the BFO/MXene nanohybrid. Figure 6b shows the photocatalytic
degradation capacity of bare BFO and the BFO/MXene nanohybrid. It
can be observed that only 33% of the Congo Red (CR) was degraded by
pure BFO under visible light irradiation in 42 min. This shows that
pure BFO is very stable and not suitable for degradation. The previously
reported photocatalytic degradation of CR using pure MXene (Ti3C2) was 12% in 120 min.80 Crystal clear water was obtained in only 42 min by using BFO/MXene
as a photocatalyst with visible light irradiation. From Figure 6c, it was observed that only
21% of the Congo Red dye was degraded from catalytic solution under
dark experiments, which shows that BFO/MXene is a better photocatalyst
rather than a catalyst in dark conditions. Degradation
of the dye can be achieved in two conditions, dark and light conditions,
and it occurs via a combination of surface adsorption and degradation
mechanisms. The degradation mechanism is explained in a later section.

spectra of the BFO/MXene nanohybrid. (b) Photocatalytic
degradation of CR by BFO and the BFO/MXene nanohybrid against time
taken using light. (c) Degradation of CR by the BFO/MXene nanohybrid
against time taken under dark condition experiments. (d) Four cycles
of the degradation process. (e) BFO/MXene XRD curve before and after
irradiation.

The photocatalytic activity also
depends upon the electron and
hole recombination process as stated earlier, and BFO/MXene’s
PL intensity is quite weaker than BFO’s, which also supports
the fact that a lower PL intensity means a higher photocatalytic activity
of the system. Previous reports on BFO/graphene hybrids showed a higher
surface area and higher photogeneration rate, in turn providing higher
photocatalytic activity.13,17,20,44 Here, the produced system has
a higher BET surface area of 147 m2 g–1, in comparison with previously reported bare BFO, BFO/graphene hybrids,
and their other derivatives, thus causing higher production of charge
carries for the redox reactions and hence providing more effective
photodegradation of the organic dye (CR). Thus, the improved photocatalytic
activity should be attributed to the following factors as stated earlier:
higher charge carrier generation of BFO; large separation time of
electrons and holes; slight reduction in crystallite size; higher
BFO/MXene surface area, which provides a larger number of active sites
as compared to that of bare BFO nanoparticles; and higher surface
area of the BFO/MXene nanohybrid, providing quick transfer of excited
charges from BFO to MXene sheets.

The stability of photocatalysts
is a key factor for their practical
applications. From Figure 6d,e, it can be seen that, after four cycling runs, the crystal
structure of BFO/MXene remains the same before and after photocatalytic
degradation reactions, which makes BFO/MXene a stable visible light-induced
catalyst and thus suitable for commercial applications.

2.6 Photocatalytic Degradation Mechanism
Visible light
irradiation produces electron–hole pairs in
the material; the electrons combine with O2, and the holes
combine with OH– to produce super oxide and free
hydroxyl radicals, respectively. These radicals are highly active
species that degrade the organic pollutants and produce some harmless
byproducts (CO2 and H2O). Figure 7 explains the photocatalytic degradation
mechanism. The photo-excited BFO/MXene produces electron–hole
paired charge carriers (eq 2). The MXene sheets quickly trap the electrons, reducing the
chances of recombination, as shown by the lower PL intensity of BFO/MXene
earlier. In aqueous media, electrons on combining with O2 produce superoxide anion radicals ·O2–, and on the other hand, holes interact with OH– to produce free hydroxyl radicals ·OH–. The·O2– and ·OH– radicals are highly reactive toward the degradation
of organic pollutants, thus degrading CR into harmless products (CO2 and H2O). Previous reports on dye degradation
show the degradation mechanism as shown here.45,81−86

Figure 7 BFO/MXene
nanohybrid degrading organic dye molecules.

The following equations express the whole photodegradation mechanism: 2   3   4   5   6   7  

The improved photocatalytic activity of BFO/MXene is due to
the
higher electron–hole pair generation, lower recombination rate
of charge carriers, wider absorption of photons, and enhanced redox
reactions on the photocatalyst surface.

2.7 Catalytic
and Photocatalytic Degradation of
Acetophenone
Figure 8 shows the degradation of acetophenone under dark and light
conditions. The BFO/ MXene nanohybrid was also studied for degradation
of acetophenone under dark and light conditions. To prepare the pollutant
solution, 100 mg of the prepared BFO/MXene photocatalyst was added
into 30 ppm acetophenone solution having a volume of 100 mL. After
2 h of stirring, we get a homogeneous saturated solution of pollutants
and catalysts. In the first experiment, the solution was put under
light and its degradation concentration was checked every 30 min for
up to 150 min until the solution was clear and the pollutant was completely
degraded. To check the remaining pollutant concentration, every 30
min, 5 mL of the prepared sample was taken out and centrifuged at
7000 rpm, and the supernatant was characterized using a UV–visible
spectrophotometer to check the absorbance, which is related to the
remaining pollutant concentration in the solution. Figure 8b shows the degradation of
acetophenone under light; the pollutant was degraded completely in
150 min. In the second experiment, the homogeneous mixture of pollutants
and catalysts was kept in dark conditions for 2 h and then under light.
The same method stated above was repeated for checking the remaining
pollutant concentration, and the BFO/MXene nanohybrid degraded the
same pollutant in 150 min but with less efficiency, only 60% of the
acetophenone was degraded in a similar time as shown in Figure 8c. In the second experiment
with the dark phase, the adsorption of acetophenone on the catalyst’s
surface reaches the equilibrium point. Although the large surface
area of (BFO/MXene) allows more adsorption of organic molecules on
the catalyst surface, in the process of achieving a homogeneous mixture
of catalysts and organic pollutants, as a result, light may not interact
completely with the catalyst, and it might be the reason for the less
efficient degradation of the pollutant by the catalyst, which is supported
by the first experiment in comparison with Figure 8b. It is difficult to degrade the pollutant
acetophenone as compared to other organic pollutants such as organic
dyes Congo Red (CR) and methyl violet due to the highly stable benzene
ring in its structure. However, the degradation rate of acetophenone
and Congo Red (CR) by the newly produced nanohybrid was almost the
same due to the enhanced properties of the BFO/MXene nanohybrid. In
a word, BFO/MXene is highly efficient in degrading colored compounds,
such as CR, as well as colorless compounds, like acetophenone, because
of its good physical and chemical properties.45

3 Conclusions
BiFeO3 (BFO) nanoparticles
were prepared using a sol–gel
method. The two-dimensional (2D) MXene sheets were synthesized from
their pure MAX phase (Ti3AlC2) by chemical etching
of aluminum and hydrofluoric acid (HF) was used as the etchant. The
reaction was done at room temperature. The BFO/MXene nanohybrid was
fabricated using a double-solvent solvothermal technique. The nanohybrid
was found to have the largest BET surface area of 147 m2 g–1, a low band gap of 1.96 eV, and a low recombination
time. The nanohybrid was further tested for photocatalytic degradation
of Congo Red and acetophenone. It comes out to be the best photocatalyst
under visible light irradiation, which degraded the Congo Red dye
in only 42 min. It can be seen that the degradation of the colorless
pollutant acetophenone was also achieved completely in ∼150
min. Meanwhile, the degradation of the same pollutant under dark effects
was only 60% in the same time. This shows that the present catalyst
(BFO/MXene) is very efficient for the colorless organic pollutant
acetophenone. Although colorless organic pollutants are difficult
to degrade, the highly efficient BFO/MXene nanohybrid makes it possible.
The high photocatalytic activity attained here is unique in itself,
which makes it a potential candidate for commercial applications owing
to its low-cost synthesis route.

an equal ratio in ethylene glycol and acetic acid solution followed
by stirring for 180 min. The detailed synthesis method is given elsewhere.48

4.4 Synthesis of BiFeO3/MXene Nanohybrid
The BiFeO3/MXene (BFO/MXene)
nanohybrid was fabricated
using a double-solvent solvothermal technique. MXene solution was
made in DI water with a molarity of 0.5 mg/mL followed by ultrasonication
for 10 min. The BFO nanoparticles were dissolved in a mixture of acetic
acid and ethylene glycol with a 1:1 ratio and (0.01 M) molarity. The
BFO solution was ultrasonicated for 1 h at 60 °C; after that,
both the prepared solutions were mixed and transferred to a Teflon-lined
steel autoclave for solvothermal synthesis at 160 ° C for 2 h.
The final product was washed with deionized (DI) water several times
and then dried it at 80 ° C for 3 h.

4.5 Characterization
The structural analysis
was done by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (XRD, Rigaku 2500, Japan) with
Cu Kα radiation. The scan angle range was 2θ ≈
5–65° using Cu Kα radiation operating at a voltage
of 40 kV and current of 20 mA. The surface morphologies of MXene and
the BFO/MXene nanohybrid were investigated using a field emission
scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL7001F) and a transmission
electron microscope (TEM, Hitachi HT7700, 100 kV). Platinum was sputter-coated
before characterization on the nanohybrid to avoid any charging effect.
The ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis
DRS) were obtained using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi
UV-3310, Japan) to calculate the band gap and photocatalytic activity
of the BFO/MXene nanohybrid. The BET surface area and porosity of
the sample were investigated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method using a Quadrasorb-SI v. 5.06 by N2 sorption/desorption
isotherms at a temperature of 77.35 K. For adsorption measurements,
the BFO/MXene sample was degassed at 300 °C. The surface area
was calculated using a multipoint BET method, and the Barret-Joyner-Halenda
(BJH) method was used to calculate the pore size. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) was used to study the binding energies of all the
elements. Photoluminescence spectroscopy was used to observe the charge
carrier’s generation/recombination rate.

4.5.1 Photocatalytic
Characterization
The photocatalytic measurements of pure
and hybrid BFO structures
were performed by the degradation of organic compound Congo Red (CR)
under visible light illumination. A 100 mg/L aqueous solution of BFO
and BFO/MXene samples was prepared. The photocatalyst (100 mg) was
dispersed into the dye solution and stirred for nearly 2 h under dark
conditions to get equilibrium adsorption–desorption between
the photocatalyst and the organic dye molecules. To keep the system’s
temperature moderate and also to avoid any thermal contact during
magnetic stirring, an ice bath was provided. For the visible light
source, a xenon lamp of 300 W was used. The solution (3 mL) was taken
out after every 8 min during the whole photocatalytic reaction. After
centrifugation, the supernatant was separated from the catalyst dye
solution and further processed through UV–vis spectroscopy.
The photocatalytic degradation efficiency was estimated by eq 8(20,45,87,88) 8  where Co is the
initial concentration of CR and C is the concentration
of CR after time interval t. Visible light (420 nm
< λ < 780 nm) was used to observe the photocatalytic efficiencies
of pure BFO and the BFO/MXene nanohybrid.
