To achieve high-Tg and low-dielectric
epoxy thermosets, four dicyclopentadiene-derived polyarylates (26-P,
26-M, 236-P, and 236-M) were prepared from 2,6-dimethyl (or 2,3,6-trimethyl)
phenol-dicyclopentadiene adduct with terephthaloyl (or isophthaloyl)
chloride by high-temperature solution polymerization. The resulting
polyarylates, exhibiting active ester linkages (Ph–O–(C=O)−)
are found to be reactive toward a commercial dicyclopentadiene phenol
epoxy (HP7200) in the presence of some lone-pair electron-containing
compounds. Five compounds including 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP),
imidazole, 2-methylimidazole, triphenylphosphine, and triphenylimidazole
have been evaluated as a catalyst for the curing reactions. We found
that DMAP, with the smallest pKb among
them, is the best catalyst according to differential scanning calorimetry,
infrared, and thermal analyses. The thermal and dielectric properties
of the polyarylate/HP7200 thermosets are evaluated. We found that
they exhibit a high Tg characteristic
(e.g., Tg is 238 °C for DMAP-catalyzed,
236-P/HP7200 thermoset). Furthermore, because of the hydrophobic methyl
and cycloaliphatic moieties, and the secondary hydroxyl-free structure,
polyarylate/HP7200 thermosets show a relative low-dielectric constant
of around 2.75 U. The detailed structure–properties relationship
is discussed in this work.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Because
of the good chemical resistance, adhesion, dimensional
stability, and insulation after thermal curing, epoxy resins have
been widely applied in the electronic field such as encapsulation
and printed circuit boards. Generally, epoxy resins are cured by reacting
the epoxy groups with active hydrogen-containing curing agents, such
as phenol novolac, diamines, and thiols.1−11 The curing reaction leads to a highly polar secondary alcohol linkages,
which will increase the dielectric constant of epoxy thermosets. Therefore,
compared with other low-dielectric thermosets,12 epoxy thermosets show a moderate-to-high dielectric constant.

Using active ester-type epoxy curing agents (curing agents with
Ph–O–(C=O)– structure) is a solution to
prepare secondary alcohol-free epoxy thermosets.13−15 (Note that
the active esters mentioned in this work are different from those
reviewed by Das and Theato for postpolymerization modification).16 Nakamura and Arima prepared a triphenol and
its active ester as epoxy curing agents,15 and they found that epoxy thermosets cured by the active ester exhibit
better dielectric properties than those cured by the triphenol. They
also (1) cured copolymers of phenyl methacrylate (contains active
ester moiety after polymerization of the C=C bond) by polyfunctional
epoxy;17,18 (2) prepared polyethers with pendant ester
by the condensation of p-phenylene dibenzoate with
diepoxy in the presence of quaternary salts or the mixture of crown
ether with organic and inorganic salts;19,20 and (3) studied
thermocrosslinking reactions of polymers containing pendant epoxy
with various active esters.21−23

Nelson and Jackson,24 Hiroaki,25 Wang et
al.,26,27 have synthesized
low-dielectric hydrocarbon-containing epoxy thermosets. Among these
hydrocarbons, dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) and higher oligomers of cyclopentadiene
are the most commonly used starting materials because of their availability
(DCPD is a byproduct of C5 streams in oil refineries) and low cost.
Taking advantage of DCPD, Dainippon Ink and Chemicals Corporation
has commercialized EPICLON HPC-8000, a phenol-DCPD adduct-based active
ester for preparing low-dielectric epoxy thermosets.28 In addition to HPC-8000, DC808, a phenol novolac-based
active ester, has been commercialized by Japan Epoxy Resins for preparing
low-dielectric epoxy thermosets.29

The commercial active ester-type curing agents such as EPICLON
HPC-8000 and DC808 are oligomer types. They are generally prepared
from the esterification of (a) phenol-DCPD adduct, or (b) naphthol-DCPD
adduct, or (c) phenol-formaldehyde novolac, or (d) biphenol A-formaldehyde
novolac (Figure 1).
It is worth noticing that main-chain-type epoxy curing agents show
a series of advantages,30−32 such as improvement in the thermal
and mechanical properties of the epoxy thermosets. For example, Francis
et al. prepared a hydroxyl-terminated poly(ether ether ketone) with
different molecular weights and used them as epoxy curing agents.33−35 They found that the mechanical properties of thermosets increase
with the increase in the molecular weight of the curing agents. In
our previous work,36 we have successfully
prepared a phenol-functionalized phosphinated polyether (P1). P1,
with phenol linkages, can react with cresol novolac epoxy to get a
flexible and transparent of an epoxy thermosetting film with a Tg value as high as 250 °C. We have also
demonstrated that high-MW polybenzoxazine precursors can lead benzoxazine
thermosets to a much higher Tg than those
cured by monomer-type benzoxazines.37,38 The secondary
alcohol resulting from the curing reaction of active hydrogen and
epoxy can provide intermolecular interactions, so epoxy thermosets
cured by active hydrogens show higher Tg than those cured by active ester-type curing agents. This is the
penalty for epoxy thermosets cured by active ester-type curing agents.
However, our previous work36−38 indicates that using polymeric-type
curing agent can result in epoxy thermosets with a high Tg characteristic.

of active esters)

novolac, and (d) biphenol A-formaldehyde novolac.

In this work, combining the concept of (1) active ester,
(2) polymeric-type
curing agent, and (3) hydrophobic DCPD and methyl groups, we prepare
four DCPD-derived polyarylates (26-P, 26-M, 236-P, and 236-M) for
preparing high-Tg, low-dielectric epoxy
thermosets. The resulting polyarylates, all with active ester Ph–O–(C=O)–linkages,
are reactive toward epoxy resin in the presence of some lone-pair
electron-containing compounds. To the best of our knowledge, no DCPD-derived
polyarylates have been applied as curing agents. Five compounds including
4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), imidazole (Imi), 2-methylimidazole
(2-MI), triphenylphosphine (TPP), and triphenylimidazole (TPI) have
been evaluated as a catalyst for the curing reactions. We found that
the basicity of the compound has a strong influence on curing reactions
and thermal and dielectric properties of the resulting epoxy thermosets.
The synthesis of polyarylates and the influence of the catalyst on
curing reaction and properties of thermosets will be discussed in
this work.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
of 2,6-Phenol-DCPD and 2,3,6-Phenol-DCPD
2,6-Phenol-DCPD
and 2,3,6-phenol-DCPD were prepared from the alkylation
of DCPD with 2,6-dimethyl phenol or 2,3,6-dimethyl phenol, respectively,
in the presence of AlCl3 (Scheme 1). The reaction involves two steps. In the
first step, DCPD reacted with AlCl3 to form carbocations,
which then reacted with 2,6-dimethyl phenol or 2,3,6-dimethyl phenol
in the second step. Figure S1 shows the 1H NMR spectra of 2,6-phenol-DCPD and 2,3,6-phenol-DCPD. There
are no unsaturated −HC=CH– signals of DCPD at
5.4 and 5.9 ppm in both spectra, indicating a complete reaction. The
signals of aliphatic hydrogens and methyl in the range of 1.2–3.6
ppm, the characteristic peaks of Ar-H at 6.6–7.0 ppm, and the
OH peaks at 4.43 and 4.46 ppm support the structure of 2,6-phenol-DCPD
and 2,3,6-phenol-DCPD. There are multiple constitutional isomers in
both 2,6-phenol-DCPD39 and 2,3,6-phenol-DCPD,
so the peak patterns are not as simple as a pure compound. Figure S2 shows the infrared (IR) spectra of
DCPD, 2,6-phenol-DCPD, and 2,3,6-phenol-DCPD. The characteristic peak
of unsaturated HC=CH signals at 3053 and 750 cm–1 disappeared, and characteristic absorption of the aromatic ring
at 1490–1450 cm–1 and the OH absorption at
3400–3230 cm–1 support the structure of 2,6-phenol-DCPD
and 2,3,6-phenol-DCPD.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of 2,6-Phenol-DCPD and 2,3,6-Phenol-DCPD
and Four Polyarylates
2.2 Synthesis of Polyarylates
Polyarylates
were prepared from 2,6-phenol-DCPD or 2,3,6-phenol-DCPD with terephthaloyl
chloride (TPC) or isophthaloyl chloride (IPC) by high-temperature
solution polymerization in o-dichlorobenzene (Scheme 1). Figure 2 shows the 1H NMR
of the four polyarylates. The Ar-H from the terephthalic structure
was clearly observed at 8.4 ppm for 26-P and 236-P. The Ar-H from
the isophthalic structure was clearly observed at 7.8, 8.5, and 9.2
ppm for 26-M and 236-M. Figure S3 shows
the IR spectra of the four polyarylates. The broad and strong OH absorption
at around 3500 cm–1 disappeared, and the ester absorption
at 1735 cm–1 was clearly observed. Figure S4 shows the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
thermograms of synthesized polyarylates. The Tg values are 224, 199, 187, and 177 °C for 26-P, 26-M,
236-P, and 236-M, respectively. The Tg values depend on the structure of polyarylates. Polyarylates 26-P
and 236-P, with the para-substituted structure, are more rigid than
those (26-P and 236-P) with the meta-substituted structure, leading
to higher Tg values. Furthermore, the
236-series polyarylates (236-P and 236-M) have lower Tg values than 26-series polyarylates (26-P and 26-M),
probably because of the fact that the three methyl substitutions hinder
the molecular packing.

236-P, and (d) 236-M.

2.3 Influence of Catalysts on the Exothermic Peak
of DSC Thermograms
Figure 3 shows DSC heating scans of polyarylate/HP7200 blends
using different types of catalysts. Note that the word blend means
polyarylate/HP7200 has not been thermally cured before DSC scans.
The order of the exothermic peak temperature is DMAP-catalyzed <
2MI-catalyzed < Imi-catalyzed systems, suggesting that DMAP is
the best catalyst among them. No exothermic peak was found for TPP-
and TPI-catalyzed systems, indicating that no reaction occurs in both
systems. Figure 4 lists
the pKb and structure of catalysts used
in this work. According to Figures 3 and 4, we found that a catalyst
with smaller pKb has the lower exothermic
peak temperature. These results indicate that a catalyst with a stronger
basicity displays a better catalytic effect, and DMAP is found to
be the best catalyst among them.

2.4 Influence
of Catalysts on Carbonyl Absorption
of IR Spectra
In our previous work, we have designed a model
reaction of glycidyl phenyl ether and phenyl acetate at 120 °C
in a molten state in the presence of 2.0 wt % (based on the weight
of glycidyl phenyl ether) DMAP.40 After
careful evaluation of the product’s peaks, we found the reaction
product is 1,3-diphenoxy-2-acetoxypropane (Figure 5). The carbonyl absorption changes from Ar–O–C=O–
to R–O–C=O–. According to the IR absorption
principle, aromatic ester with Ar–O–(C=O) has
higher absorption than that of aliphatic ester with R–O–(C=O).41 Therefore, we can use the shift of C=O
absorption to monitor the reaction of polyarylate and HP7200 in the
presence of a catalyst.

Figure 5 Model reaction of glycidyl phenyl ether and
phenyl acetate in the
presence of DMAP.

Figure 6 shows enlarged
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of polyarylates and polyarylate/HP7200
thermosets catalyzed by different catalysts. Note that the word thermoset
means polyarylate/HP7200 has been thermally cured. The C=O
absorption value of epoxy thermosets is listed in Figure 7. For DMAP-, Imi-, and 2MI-catalyzed
system, the shift is obvious from around 1737 cm–1 to around 1725 cm–1. The order of IR shift is
DMAP-catalyzed > 2MI-catalyzed > Imi-catalyzed systems, suggesting
that DMAP is the best catalyst among them. No shift in carbonyl absorption
was found for TPP- and TPI-catalyzed systems, indicating that no reaction
occurs in both systems.

X is the catalyst: DMAP, 2MI, Imi, TPP, and TPI, respectively.

The results indicate that a catalyst
with a stronger basicity has
a better catalytic effect, and DMAP is found to be the best catalyst
among them. This result is consistent with the DSC thermogram in Figure 3.

2.5 Proposed Mechanism
According to the
conclusion of the model reaction of glycidyl phenyl ether and phenyl
acetate in the presence of DMAP40 and IR
spectra in Figure 6, we propose a curing mechanism of polyarylate (236-P) and HP7200
in the presence of DMAP in Scheme 2. The first step is the attack of DMAP on the epoxy
group of HP7200, forming intermediate (I) with an alkoxy
anion. The second step is the nucleophilic substitution of the alkoxy
anion of (I) on the ester group of polyarylate, forming
intermediate (II) and polyarylate with a phenoxy anion.
The third step is the nucleophilic substitution of the phenoxy anion
of polyarylate on the carbon of the C–N bond of (II), forming intermediate (III) and releasing DMAP that
can repeat step 1. Another way to obtain (III) is through
steps 4 and 5. The fourth step is the nucleophilic addition of the
phenoxy anion of polyarylate on the epoxy group of HP7200, forming
intermediate (IV) with an alkoxy anion. The fifth step
is the nucleophilic substitution of the alkoxy anion of (IV) on the ester group of polyarylate, forming (III) and
polyarylate with a phenoxy anion that can repeat step 4.

2.6 Solubility of Polyarylate/HP7200 Thermosets
Table 1 lists the
solubility of the polyarylates and polyarylate/HP7200 thermosets.
With 10 wt % concentration, the four polyarylates are soluble in tetrahydrofuran
(THF), NMP, toluene, N,N-dimethyl
acetamide (DMAc), and CHCl3 at room temperature, and are
soluble in methyl ether ketone (MEK) on heating. The multiple methyl
groups and multiple constitutional isomers of 2,6-dimethyl (or 2,3,6-trimethyl)
phenol-DCPD adduct make them soluble. The good solubility of polyarylates
makes them easy for solution processing for future application in
copper clad laminate. In contrast to the good solubility of polyarylates,
the thermosets are insoluble, suggesting that network structures are
formed.

2.7 Thermomechanical Property
To discuss
the influence of the catalyst on Tg of
a thermoset, we evaluate polyarylate/HP7200 thermosets catalyzed by
different catalysts by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA, Figure 8). The data are listed
in Table 2. With the
same polyarylate, the order in the Tg value
is DMAP-catalyzed > 2MI-catalyzed > Imi-catalyzed systems. For
example,
for 26-P/E-X, Tg values are 239, 222,
and 217 when X is DMAP, 2MI, and Imi, respectively. The results indicate
that a catalyst with a stronger basicity has a better catalytic effect,
and DMAP is found to be the best catalyst among them.

According to the IR spectra (Figure 7), the shift of the C=O signal strongly depends
on the basicity of the catalyst. Therefore, the difference in Tg is attributed to the different curing degrees.
To discuss the influence of polyarylate on Tg of the thermoset, DMA thermograms of polyarylate/HP7200 thermosets
cured by different polyarylates are shown in Figure S5. With the same catalyst, the order in Tg values is generally 26-P/E-X > 236-P/E-X > 26-M/E-X
> 236-M/E-X. For example, the Tg values
are 239, 238, 225, and 209 °C for 26-P/E-DMAP, 236-P/E-DMAP,
26-M/E-DMAP, and 236-M/E-DMAP, respectively. Thermosets based on the
para-substituted polyarylate (26-P and 236-P) are more rigid than
those based on the meta-substituted polyarylates (26-M and 236-M).
The Tg values in this work are in the
range of 209–239 °C, which are much higher than that (165
°C, DMA data) of the DMAP-catalyzed EPICLON HPC-8000/HP-7200
thermoset.42 This work demonstrates that
the epoxy thermoset cured by polymeric-type curing agents with active
ester in the main chain, such as polyarylates in this work, displays
higher Tg than those cured by oligomeric-type
curing agents with active ester in the side chain, such as HPC-8000.

To further discuss the influence of the catalyst on Tg of a thermoset, we evaluate polyarylate/HP7200 thermosets
catalyzed by different catalysts by thermomechanical analysis (TMA)
(Figure 9). The data
are listed in Table 2. With the same polyarylate, the order in the Tg value is DMAP-catalyzed > 2MI-catalyzed > Imi-catalyzed
systems.
For example, for 26-P/E-X, Tg values are
197, 187, and 186 when X is DMAP, 2MI, and Imi, respectively. The
relation between the type of the catalyst and Tg is the same as those observed in DMA data. However, no obvious
trend between structure and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE)
was observed. To discuss the influence of polyarylate on Tg of a thermoset, TMA thermograms of polyarylate/HP7200
thermosets cured by different polyarylates are shown in Figure S6. With the same catalyst, the order
in Tg values is 26-P/E-X > 236-P/E-X
>
26-M/E/X > 236-M/E-X. For example, Tg values
are 197, 195, 188, and 179 °C for 26-P/E-DMAP, 236-P/E-DMAP,
26-M/E-DMAP, and 236-M/E-DMAP, respectively. The relation between
the structure of polyarylates and Tg is
the same as those observed in DMA data.

2.8 Thermal
Stability
Figure S7 shows the
thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) thermograms
of the thermosets in a nitrogen atmosphere. Table 2 lists the thermal stability data of polyarylate/HP7200
thermosets. The onset degradation temperature in a nitrogen atmosphere
is around 400 °C, and the 5 wt % degradation temperatures (Td5) in nitrogen atmosphere range from 406 to
416 °C, and char yields are in the range of 10–15%. These
values are slightly higher than typical epoxy thermosets, suggesting
the benefit in thermal stability using polyarylates as the curing
agent. However, no obvious structure–thermal stability relationship
was found.

2.9 Dielectric Property
Table 3 lists the
dielectric constant
and dissipation factor of the polyarylate/HP7200 thermosets. The dielectric
constant ranges from 2.74 to 2.88 U, and the dissipation factor ranges
from 10.1 to 15.4 mU. With the same catalyst, meta-substituted polyarylate/HP7200
thermosets show better dielectric properties than para-substituted
polyarylate/HP7200 thermosets. For example, the dielectric constant
(dissipation factor) is 2.88 U (15.1 mU) and 2.83 U (14.3 mU) for
26-P/E-2MI and 26-M/E-2MI, respectively; and it is 2.83 U (14.0 mU)
and 2.76 U (12.5 mU) for 236-P/E-2MI and 236-M/E-2MI, respectively.
In addition, epoxy thermosets cured by trimethyl-substituted polyarylates
(236-P and 236-M) show better dielectric properties than those cured
by dimethyl-substituted polyarylates (26-P and 26-M). For example,
the dielectric constant (dissipation factor) is 2.85 U (14.8 mU) and
2.75 U (13.5 mU) for 26-P/E-DMAP and 236-P/E-DMAP, respectively; and
it is 2.83 U (13.6 mU) and 2.74 U (10.1 mU) for 26-M/E-DMAP and 236-M/E-DMAP,
respectively.

Hougham et al. reported that the dielectric constant
can be reduced
by increasing the molecule’s hydrophobicity and free volume
and by decreasing polarization.43 The fact
that the meta-substituted polyarylates provide higher free volume
than the para-substituted polyarylates might be responsible for the
better dielectric property of meta-substituted polyarylate/HP7200
thermosets. The hydrophobic methyl group might be the reason for the
better dielectric property of trimethyl-substituted polyarylate/HP7200
thermosets. As listed in Table 3, with the same polyarylate, the order of the dissipation
factor is generally DMAP-catalyzed < 2MI-catalyzed < Imi-catalyzed
systems. For example, the dissipation factor is 14.8, 15.1, and 15.4
mU for 26-P/E-DMAP26-P/E-2MI and 26-P/E-Imi; and it is 10.1, 12.5,
and 12.9 mU for 236-M/E-DMAP, 236-M/E-2MI, and 236-M/E-Imi, respectively.

Previous data (Figure 3, 6–9) show that the order of the catalytic effect
is DMAP > 2MI > Imi, so the higher conversion (with less residual
high-polar epoxy) might be the reason for the order of the dissipation
factor. The dielectric constant is in the range of 2.74–2.88
U, which is much smaller than that (around 3.5)44−48 for common epoxy thermosets. We think that the hydrophobic
methyl and cycloaliphtic moiety and the secondary alcohol-free structure
of the thermosets are responsible for the good dielectric properties.
Moreover, the Tg corresponding to the
dielectric constant of 2.74–2.88 is as high as 209–239
°C (Tables 2 and 3), demonstrating that high-Tg, low-dielectric epoxy thermosets can be achieved through
this facile approach.

3 Conclusions
We have
successfully prepared four DCPD-derived polyarylates. The
resulting polyarylates, exhibiting active ester linkages (Ph–O–(C=O)−),
are found to be reactive toward epoxy (HP7200) in the presence of
some lone-pair electron-containing compounds. Among the compounds,
DMAP, with the lowest pKb, has the lowest
exothermic peak for the polyarylate/HP7200 blend in the DSC thermogram
(Figure 3), the highest
C=O shift of the thermoset in the IR spectrum (Figure 6), and the highest Tg of thermosets (Figures 8 and 9). Tg values of thermosets cured by the four polyarylates
are in the range of 209–239 °C, which are much higher
than that (165 °C) of the DMAP-catalyzed commercialized EPICLON
HPC-8000/HP-7200 thermoset. This result demonstrates the advantage
of polyarylates over commercialized oligomeric-type curing agents
in thermal properties. With the same catalyst, thermosets based on
the para-substituted polyarylate (26-P and 236-P) display higher Tg than those based on the meta-substituted polyarylates
(26-M and 236-M) (Table 2). Thermosets based on meta-substituted and trimethyl-substituted
polyarylates (236-M) show the best dielectric properties. With the
same polyarylate, the value of the dissipation factor is generally
DMAP-catalyzed < 2MI-catalyzed < Imi-catalyzed systems (Table 3), which is the inverse
order of reactivity of the catalyst. In other words, a catalyst with
a better reactivity will lead to a better dissipation factor, probably
because of the better conversion that will transform highly polar
epoxy groups to less polar ester groups. The dielectric constant of
epoxy thermosets ranges from 2.74 to 2.88 U which is much smaller
than that (around 3.5) for common epoxy thermosets. The Tg values corresponding to the dielectric constant of 2.74–2.88
are as high as 209–239 °C, demonstrating that high-Tg, low-dielectric epoxy thermosets can be achieved
through this facile approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first example using DCPD-derived polyarylates as epoxy curing
agents to achieve high-Tg and low-dielectric
epoxy thermosets.

(2,6-Phenol-DCPD)
2,6-Dimethyl phenol (0.7143 mol) and AlCl3 (0.015 mol) were added to a four-necked round-bottomed flask
equipped with a nitrogen inlet, magnetic stirrer, thermocouple, and
temperature controller. The reaction mixture was gradually heated
to 120 °C. DCPD 0.1 mol was added gradually over a period of
2 h. The solution was kept at 120 °C for another 4 h. After the
reaction was completed, 0.06 mol of 5 wt % NaOH(aq) was
added, and the mixture was stirred for 1 h. The reaction mixture was
filtered, and the filtrate was washed three times with water. Next,
the organic phase was separated and distilled in a rotary evaporator
to remove excess 2,6-dimethyl phenol. The crude product was dissolved
in toluene and extracted with water for several times. The organic
phase was distilled to remove toluene, and a deep-brown 2,6-phenol-DCPD

solution was poured into methanol to precipitate the polyarylate.
After filtration, the filter cake was washed two times with methanol/water
(1/1, v/v) and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven to obtain a brown
polyarylate (26-P). The yield is quantitative. 1H NMR (ppm,

4.8 Curing Procedure for the Polyarylate/Epoxy
Thermoset
The DCPD-phenol epoxy, HP7200, was thermally cured
by the four polyarylates. The molar ratio of the ester moiety to oxirane
(epoxy group) was controlled at one. Polyarylate, HP7200, and a catalyst
(DMAP, Imi, 2MI, TPP, or TPI) 0.5 wt % (based on the weight of epoxy)
were dissolved in NMP to make a solution with 30 wt % solid content.
The viscous solution was cast on a glass by an automatic film applicator.
The resulting thin films were dried at 80 °C for 12 h. Then,
under nitrogen atmosphere, the curing process was done for 140 °C
(2 h), 160 °C (2 h), 180 °C (2 h), and 200 °C (2 h).
The thermosets are named in the format of “polyarylate/E-X”.
X is the catalyst. For example, the thermoset cured from 26-P, HP7200,
and DMAP is named 26-P/E-DMAP and that cured from 236-M, HP7200 and
Imi is named 236-M/E-Imi and so on.

4.9 Characterization
DMA was performed
with a PerkinElmer Pyris Diamond DMA with a sample size of 5.0 cm
× 1.0 cm × 0.2 cm, and the test was performed using a tension
mode with an amplitude of 25 μm. The storage modulus and tan(δ)
were determined as the sample subjected to the temperature scan mode
at a programmed heating rate of 5 °C/min with a frequency of
1 Hz. NMR measurements were performed using a Varian Inova 600 NMR
in DMSO-d6 or CDCl3. The chemical
shift of 1H NMR was calibrated by setting the chemical
shift of a trace amount of DMSO-d5 in
DMSO-d6 as 2.49 ppm. IR spectra were obtained
in the standard wavenumber range of 400–4000 cm–1 by a PerkinElmer RX1 IR spectrophotometer. TGA was performed with
PerkinElmer Pyris 1 at a heating rate of 20 °C/min in a nitrogen
atmosphere. Dielectric properties were determined with Agilent E4991A
at 1 GHz with a sample size with 2.5 cm in diameter and thickness
at least 200 μm. TMA was performed by a SII TMA/SS6100 at a
heating rate of 5 °C/min. The CTE was recorded at the temperature
range of 50–150 °C. GPC was performed by Hitachi L2400
in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) (Hitachi, Tarrytown,
NY, Tarrytown, USA), using polystyrene as the standard.
