Kinetic
doping has previously been shown to be an effective method
of doping silica sol–gel thin films with an enzyme to construct
biosensors. Until now, kinetic doping has only been applied to films
produced through the spin-coating method. In this study, we present
the use of dip-coating to produce thin films kinetically doped for
biosensor development. In this way, kinetically doped biosensors may
benefit from the increased range of substrate material shapes and
sizes that may be easily coated through dip-coating but not spin-coating.
The biosensors produced through dip-coating continue to show enhanced
performance over more conventional enzyme loading methods with horseradish
peroxidase and cytochrome C samples, showing an increase of 2400×
and 1300× in enzyme concentration over that in their loading
solutions, respectively. These correspond to enzyme concentrations
of 5.37 and 10.57 mmol/L all while preserving a modest catalytic activity
for the detection of hydrogen peroxide by horseradish peroxidase.
This leads to a 77% and 88% increase in the total amount of horseradish
peroxidase and cytochrome C, respectively, over that from coating
the same glass coverslip via spin-coating methods.

Introduction
Developing and improving biosensors based
on immobilized enzymes
continue to be an ongoing research effort garnering much attention.
Immobilized enzymes display several considerable improvements compared
with enzymes in solution, including, but not limited to, their reusability
and relative ease of separation from any products produced. However,
the challenge lies in both stably immobilizing the enzyme and preserving
its activity that allow the resultant composite material to function
as a biosensor. Ever since the first reported attempt to encapsulate
protein within silica glass,1 sol–gels
have become a much investigated contender for use as an immobilization
matrix.2−12 With this increased attention, it has been well established that
sol–gels do in fact meet these criteria as well as often improving
the chemical and thermal stabilities of entrapped enzymes.13 The convenience of being able to prepare thin
films from sol–gel chemistry has even further enhanced its
desirability as supportive matrix materials for biosensor development.8

Recently, our group has reported a new
technique, known as kinetic
doping,14 to produce thin films highly
loaded with the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or cytochrome C (CytC)
proteins via spin-coating.15 As opposed
to the established techniques,16−18 pre-doping where a guest molecule
is included with the sol solution and post-doping where any guest
molecule is adsorbed to the surface-accessible areas of the film after
the sol–gel chemistry for thin film formation has completed,
often after heat annealing, kinetic doping takes advantage of a window
of opportunity after casting the film and driving off the vast majority
of the ethanol, but before the sol–gel chemistry on the film
has progressed to a significant degree. The quick immersion in an
aqueous loading solution significantly slows the poly-condensation
step of the sol–gel process, extending the window for dopant
loading before the film is fully set. If stayed immersed, it usually
takes a week for a film to become fully set.

Kinetic doping
produces films with an enhanced loading efficiency,
whereas a comparable efficiency via pre-doping will require an exceedingly
high dopant concentration in the sol solution that renders pre-doping
almost impractical; this is especially true for the loading of expensive
biomolecules. In the case of post-doping, a fully set film used in
post-doping usually lacks big diffusion channels and dopant-accessible
surfaces that are prerequisites for high loading efficiency. Kinetic
doping allows dopant loading while diffusion channels and nascent
solution-accessible surfaces are forming as the poly-condensation
reaction slowly progresses, which appears to solve the problem of
post-doping and demonstrated drastic loading capacity improvement
over the more conventional method of post-doping. In particular, the
sensor so produced exhibits a near-instantaneous response time that
compared quite favorably to other modern systems, such as the chemiluminescence
biosensor developed by Wang et al. that clearly shows a moderate delay
in response time.19

One of the most
favorable aspects of kinetic doping is its ability
to accomplishing protein loading under a much more benign environment
without significantly affecting the sol–gel process. Because
the most basic sol–gel casting procedure involves using a liquid
sol mixture that usually has a sizeable composition in alcohol, it
is quite natural that most enzymes will denature if they are introduced
prior to the spin-coating process like pre-doping. Although a number
of methods of circumventing this have been developed over the years,
some involve the addition of stabilizers such as organosilanes or
polyethylene glycol, whereas others take extra steps to produce a
hybrid gel from modified precursors;20 with
most approaches inevitably increasing the material and labor cost
for dopant loading. Kinetic doping is able to provide results of the
same or even improved quality without the need for extra materials
or laborious procedures, offering a significant advantage in both
practical applications and cost effectiveness for commercialization.

In this work, we extend the kinetic doping technique to thin films
produced by the dip-coating method. The previously utilized method
of spin-coating has severe limitations on the size and shape of the
substrates that can be coated. The high rotation velocity and the
vacuum hold on the underside of the substrate to be coated limit spin-coating
to small flat substrate platforms and only on one side of the substrate.
Through dip-coating, where a thin film is formed via the removal of
a substrate surface from a solution at a controlled speed, a wider
range of material types, sizes, and shapes, including non-flat surfaces
as well as surfaces on all sides of the substrate simultaneously,
can be used to prepare kinetically doped enzyme-loaded thin films.
Dip-coating techniques can be easily scaled to include larger and
less conventional surfaces than spin-coating such that high dopant
loading silica sol–gel thin film potential can dramatically
be expanded to other practical uses. Here, we will report the process
used to produce dip-coated thin films optimal for the loading of horseradish
peroxidase and cytochrome C via kinetic doping and compare the catalytic
performance of the biocomposite thin films with those prepared by
spin-coating we reported previously.

Results and Discussion
Loading
of Rhodamine 6G (R6G)
As has been shown with
kinetically doped thin film samples produced via spin-coating, the
delay time between the end of the coating process and the immersion
in the soaking solution must be timed correctly to produce optimal
loading results.14Figure 1A above displays the resulting rhodamine
6G-loaded thin films produced via dip-coating at various delay times
ranging from no delay to a 10 min delay. It can be seen that a delay
of between 0 and 3 min is not enough for the film to gain sufficient
mechanical strength. The resultant samples suggest that the film might
be thinning due to hydrolysis of the nascent film surface or the film
could have fell apart and separated from the glass coverslip surface
when introduced to the loading solution, leaving only the outermost
edges of the film to remain attached. The same figure also suggests
that a time delay of approximately 5–6 min appears to be the
most appropriate delay for the film to properly adhere to the glass
coverslip and yet pristine enough to enable kinetic doping. Any time
delays longer than 5 min show the gradual passing of the window of
opportunity for kinetic doping and led to a steady decline of the
R6G loading capacity. At a delay of 60 min, the loading of R6G to
the dip-coated film became negligible, as reflected by the apparently
colorless 60 min sample, which is quite similar to the observation
from spin-coated thin films and is likely caused by the film advancing
along the poly-condensation process enough that the window for kinetic
doping is closed and the process becomes far more similar to simple
post-doping. On the basis of this observation, a 5 min delay was chosen
for all subsequent studies on CtyC- and HRP-loaded thin films. The
unevenness of the coating even at the optimal time delays demonstrates
the need for a vibration-free environment after the coating. Even
small vibrations appear to play a role in causing the sol to collect
along the edges of the glass coverslip artificially thickening the
film there. However, even in a completely vibration-free environment,
the dip-coating process is known to have issues with edge effects,
resulting in inhomogeneous areas extending slightly inward from the
edges.21 Subsequent experiments employing
more stringent procedures that significantly suppress the vibration
were able to produce more evenly loaded thin films such as the film
shown in Figure 1B.
Compared to that for spin-coating, where the optimal time delay is
near zero,15 the optimal time delay for
dip-coating is longer. This can be explained as in spin-coating with
its lengthy 70 s spinning process as well as approximately 30 more
seconds for the spin coater to slow to a complete halt, which followed
by another 10 s to dislodge the thin-film-coated coverslip from the
vacuum hold before transferring to the loading solution, the time
between the glass coverslip coming into contact with the sol solution
and when it is available to be immersed in the loading solution in
spin-coating is greater than the time needed for the dip-coating process.
This, along with the high-speed rotation in spin-coating driving off
ethanol faster than the stationary drain coating, likely leads to
the spin-coated thin film being further along the film formation process
than the dip-coated thin film meaning a longer delay time is required
before the dip-coated film is in the optimal condition for immersion
in the loading solution.

vibration control procedure.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained via
JEOL
JSM-880 with a 5 nm Au–Pd sputter-coated layer to examine the
morphology of the dip-coated thin film produced using the 5 min delay
determined for optimal kinetic doping. Figure 2A shows an average section of the thin film
surface, which displays the presence of microscopic cracks on the
silica film due to the shrinkage of the silica matrix caused by rapid
drying induced by the vacuum used in the sputtering process. These
random cracks, typically of any thin film sol–gel process,1,2,4,6,8,12 are small
enough that they do not significantly affect the mechanical strength
of the silica film and cause the film to detach from the glass substrate,
nor do they significantly reduce the area of the glass substrate covered
by the thin film. Figure 2B shows the internal structure of a large crack displayed
in Figure 2A and showcases
the three-dimensional structure of the completely dip-coated thin
film. Figure 2C shows
the thin film from the edge and displays the interface between the
thin film and the glass substrate as well as the thickness of the
thin film coating. Flow control methods needed to ensure a 190 nm
thickness were not applicable to the specially sized and cut sample
shown side-on in Figure 2C, resulting in a slightly thicker than typical sample.

Loading of CytC and HRP
The quantification of loaded
horseradish peroxidase and cytochrome C was carried out in a similar
manner as previously used for quantifying loaded thin films15 prepared from the spin-coating method. The calibration
curve in Figure 3 shows
a decrease in the 465 nm peak of Coomassie Brilliant Blue upon the
step-wise addition of known amounts of enzyme and indicates a reasonably
long linear range from which the mass equivalent of thin-film-loaded
proteins can be estimated.

Figure 3 Calibration curves for cytochrome C (open circle)
and horseradish
peroxidase (open triangle) generated via an adapted Bradford assay
against known enzyme concentrations.

The experimental design used is such that the sol–gel
film
with the loaded protein on a glass coverslip substrate is placed on
one side of a 45 mm(H) × 10 mm(D) × 40 mm(W) cuvette to
prevent it from blocking the optical path of the UV–vis spectrometer
and interfering with the measurement. After performing the Bradford
assay on the protein-loaded thin films, the average change in absorbance
determined from four replicate runs, such as the sample run shown
for loaded HRP in Figure 4, was 0.037 ± 0.005 for CytC and 0.052 ± 0.009 for
HRP.

Figure 4 Completed Bradford assay for the loaded HRP thin film (gray line)
compared with the original Bradford assay solution (black line).

From the calibration curve, the
recorded absorbance decrease corresponds
to 0.030 ± 0.005 mg of solution-accessible CytC and 0.055 ±
0.009 mg of solution-accessible HRP in a single thin film. This shows
that the thin film had loaded 3.04% of CytC and 5.52% of HRP present
in its enzyme loading solution. When taking into account the calculated
thickness of the thin film based on the drain rate during dip-coating
(190 nm), the coverslip surface area of 25 mm × 25 mm, which
is then doubled to account for dip-coated thin films present on both
sides of the glass coverslip, and the uncoated area of the glass coverslip
that is held above the sol solution, 12.25 square mm, the volume of
the thin film can be calculated, which can then be used to determine
the concentration of solution-accessible protein in the thin film
as 10.57 ± 1 mmol/L for CytC and 5.37 ± 0.5 mmol/L for HRP,
approximately a 1300× and 2400× increase in concentration
for CytC and HRP, respectively, compared to that of the original loading
solutions of 0.1 mg/mL. Similar to the case of loading on spin-coated
thin films, it is worth noting that these values take into consideration
only the amount of dye-accessible protein as any protein inaccessible
to the Coomassie Blue dye in the short time frame of the Bradford
assay would not be accounted for by the assay. Because of the relatively
large size of Coomassie Blue (C47H48N3NaO7S2, FW: 854.02 g/mol), it is unlikely to
diffuse through the porous thin film structure efficiently, meaning
that it is quite possible that the actual amount of protein in the
thin film is greater than what is being revealed by the Bradford assay.

The amounts of CytC and HRP loaded into the dip-coated films are
summarized in Table 1 along with reference values obtained from loaded samples made through
spin-coating15 as well as a post-doped
spin-coated sample and a blank coverslip control. Although the average
change in absorbance for the dip-coated samples is nearly double that
of the spin-coated sample, this is primarily due to the fact that
the dip-coated method can produce thin films on both sides of the
glass coverslip. The final enzyme concentration in one thin film after
taking this difference into consideration provides a better metric
for comparison. As an important advantage over spin-coating, the ability
to coat both surfaces of the glass coverslip increased the total amount
of enzyme loaded by 77% for the HRP thin film and 88% for the CytC
thin film. It can be seen that both the HRP- and CytC-loaded thin
films produced via dip-coating are very close in enzyme concentration
to their spin-coated counterparts with only a slight decrease. On
the other hand, it should also be noted that the dip-coated sample
has a larger variation in enzyme loading efficiency than the spin-coated
samples. This is currently thought to be caused by a larger variance
in the film thickness caused by the dip-coating process compared to
that by the spin-coating process, especially at the edge of the glass
coverslip substrate. Further optimization of the dip-coating process,
such as by using a commercially available dip-coater, is expected
to minimize this thickness variation.

Just as with the spin-coated samples, the loading capacity accomplished
by kinetic doping on dip-coated films represents a significant increase
relative to that of the bare glass coverslip control sample. Without
a porous film to immobilize the protein, the control sample showed
only a marginal decrease in 465 nm absorbance in an identical Bradford
assay. In fact, the magnitude of the absorbance change caused by the
control samples was smaller than the error associated with the measurement.
Also, just as the spin-coated samples, the dip-coated samples showed
a great increase in loading capacity compared to that of the more
conventional post-doping method that reached only 18.6% of the enzyme
concentration prepared from kinetic doping.

Quantification of HRP Activity
Following the determination
of the enzyme concentration loaded in the dip-coated thin films, the
next vital aspect of function for a biosensor is the retention of
catalytic activity. The activity of HRP-loaded thin films created
via dip-coating was measured in the same manner as the thin films
created via spin-coating. An assay solution that contains 140 μM
H2O2 and 300 μM guaiacol was used, where
a distinctive brown quinone, believed to be mostly from a dimeric
product, forms by the catalytic action of thin-film-encapsulated HRP.
The products produced at the film surface would gradually diffuse
into the bulk assay solution, and the rate of production of the product
could be conveniently monitored by UV–vis spectroscopy at 436
nm in real time. The activity was determined using the initial rate
method by examining the initial increase of the linear portion of
the 436 nm absorbance trace for both the free HRP and the thin-film-immobilized
HRP as a function of reaction time shown in Figure 5 below.

Figure 5 Activity of free HRP and the HRP-loaded
thin film.

The activity per mg HRP can be
calculated from the rate of guaiacol
consumption via eq 1 1  where Vt is the
total assay solution volume, ε is the extinction coefficient
of the brown quinone dimer at 436 nm, M is the mass
of HRP present (in mg), and 2 is a constant related to the stoichiometric
ratio of guaiacol to its dimeric product per reaction. Table 2 gives the resulting activity
values for the HRP-loaded thin film via dip-coating as well as the
reference values for free HRP and HRP loaded in spin-coated thin films.

Table 2 Activity Results
sample	activity (U/mg)	% of free HRP	
free HRP	35.4 ± 0.8	100	
spin-coated thin film	4.1 ± 0.2	11.7 ± 0.5	
dip-coated thin film	3.7 ± 0.2	9.7 ± 0.5	
The data show that HRP exhibits a
decrease in activity when immobilized
in a solid matrix, as expected for all such entrapped enzymes. The
activity (U/mg) of HRP in a dip-coated thin film is slightly less
than in a spin-coated thin film, but still within the range of error,
resulting in a similar activity per mg loading, as seen in Table 2. As with the spin-coated
thin films, the drop in activity relative to free HRP is thought to
be due to the limited rates of diffusion through the film’s
dense three-dimensional network. Furthermore, this is likely exacerbated
by the increase in size from the guaiacol as it transforms into its
larger dimeric product, 3,3′-dimethoxy-4,4′-biphenoquinone
(C14H12O4, FW: 244.25 g/mol). It
is important to note that the brown dimeric guaiacol product from
the catalyzed reaction can be seen to be formed on the surface of
the thin film almost instantly upon immersion in the reaction solution.
This is well before the brown color of the product can be seen to
be mixed with the rest of the reaction assay solution, serving as
further evidence that it is the outward diffusion of the larger product
that is the primary limiting factor to the rate of the catalytic reaction.

The observed drop in activity is not totally unexpected as the
earliest examples of enzymes encapsulated in sol–gels were
able to display only a little more than 1% of their activity.22−24 As the field continued to advance such that longer and more involved
processes are developed to produce the latest HRP/sol–gel biocomposite
material, a retention reaching 10% of the original activity was observed
from a similar guaiacol assay.25 We observe
very nearly the same result using the much simple kinetic doping process
reported here.

Previously, one of the highest concentrations
of HRP attained in
a silica sol–gel structure was achieved by Bhatia and Brinker,
producing silica sol–gel monoliths of up to 1 mM.24 The results reported in this study not only
represent a much higher enzyme concentration but also are produced
via a much simpler technique and is applied as a thin film coating
technique, a far more advantageous and versatile platform than the
powder produced from a monolith.

Conclusions
In
this study, the first application of the dip-coating technique
was implemented to kinetic doping to produce active biocomposite thin
films. HRP- and CytC-loaded films were produced and tested. Our results
indicate that merging dip-coating and kinetic doping together proved
to be a promising approach to biosensor development, trapping larger
quantities of the loaded enzymes than those obtained in most conventional
methods, increasing the amount of enzyme loaded by 77% and 88% over
the same piece of substrate material coated with the spin-coating
technique, while retaining activity that approaches 10% of an equivalent
amount of free HRP. With high loading capacity and moderate retention
in activity on the same level as that in the previously established
spin-coating methods, dip-coating certainly represents an even more
attractive approach as it effectively expands the enzyme-loaded thin
film coating to a much wider range of material shapes and sizes to
be used in conjunction with a much simple yet protein friendly process
of kinetic doping that is most compatible for biosensor fabrication.
The ability to easily scale up dip-coating processes to handle larger
substrate sizes and its ability to coat all available surfaces at
once give dip-coating a considerable edge in versatility over spin-coating.

Experimental
Section
Materials and General Methods
Tetraethylorthosilicate
(TEOS), CytC (from equine heart), 2, 2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic
acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), and Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Phosphoric acid and hydrogen peroxide
(30% solution) were purchased from EMD Millipore. HRP was purchased
from Gold Biotechnology. Guaiacol was purchased from Cayman Chemical
Company. Premium grade glass coverslips (25 mm × 25 mm ×
1 mm) were purchased from Fisher Scientific. All chemicals and materials
were used as received, with the exception of the glass coverslips,
which were cleaned prior to use. All UV–vis spectra were obtained
via a Shimadzu UV-2101PC UV–vis spectrometer.

Preparation
of Glass Coverslips
To remove any organic
contaminants on the glass coverslip surface, the coverslips were sonicated
in an acetone bath for 30 min and rinsed with Millipore water three
times to remove all acetone. The organic contaminant-free coverslips
were then sonicated in 10% v/v NaOH for another 30 min and rinsed
with Millipore water three times to remove all residual NaOH. The
coverslips then went through a final sonication in Millipore water
for 30 min to remove all traces of NaOH. Afterward, the coverslips
were stored in Millipore water until use.

Preparation of Silica Sol
Silica sol was prepared by
mixing 56.0 mL of TEOS, 111.7 mL of ethanol, 31.7 mL of Millipore
water, and 0.620 mL of a 1% v/v phosphoric acid solution at room temperature.
The sol was allowed to age for 18 h at room temperature in the dark
before use.

Preparation of Rhodamine 6G and CytC- and
HRP-Doped Silica Sol–Gel
Thin Films
Instead of using the conventional dip-coating
approach, the dip-coated thin film was prepared by draining a coating
sol solution from a beaker. After aging for 18 h, the silica sol solution
was transferred to a 400 mL beaker that is elevated by a jack stand.
A clean coverslip was purged, dried via compressed air, and suspended
from above while it was immersed in the aged silica sol coating solution.
The sol solution was drained from the beaker with a pump at a known
flow rate intended to result in a thin film coating thickness comparable
to that of the 190 nm thick samples previously produced and studied
via the spin-coating methods.15 The required
flow rate to produce the 190 nm thick films was calculated via the
Landau–Levich equation.26

Immediately following the complete drainage of the silica sol solution,
the jack stand holding the beaker was lowered until the newly coated
coverslip was completely outside of the beaker and exposed to ambient
air. The newly made thin film was allowed to remain exposed in ambient
air for another 5 min before it was transferred to a loading solution,
where R6G, CytC, or HRP will be loaded into the silica film via kinetic
doping. R6G loading solutions consisted of 10 mM R6G in a pH 7.4 phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) buffer, while enzyme loading solutions consisted
of 0.1 mg/mL enzyme suspended in a 10 mM, pH 7.4 PBS buffer.

A total of three different kinds of control samples were prepared.
(i) Control samples of enzyme loaded on bare glass were prepared by
placing a freshly cleaned glass coverslip directly into the CytC or
HRP loading solutions that also consisted of 0.1 mg/mL enzyme suspended
in a 10 mM pH 7.4 PBS buffer for the same period of time as that for
the sample thin films; (ii) control samples of thin films with no
enzyme loading were prepared by soaking a sol–gel film in a
10 mM, pH 7.4 PBS buffer that contains no enzyme with an immersion
time same as that for the sample films; (iii) post-doped controls
were prepared by allowing the nascent thin-film-coated coverslips
to age for 48 h, allowing the film to fully set under ambient temperature
before submersion in the CytC or HRP loading solution.

Quantitative
Determination of Cytochrome C and Horseradish Peroxidase
Loading
The mass of the loaded protein was quantified via
a modified Bradford assay using a standard calibration curve. The
assay solution was prepared according to the original Bradford method.27 Namely, 100 mg of Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye
G-250 is dissolved in 50 mL of ethanol and the reaction mixture is
then added to 100 mL of concentrated phosphoric acid and diluted to
1 L with deionized water. Upon binding to an enzyme like CytC and
HRP, the absorption maxima of the dye will exhibit a significant red
shift from 465 to 595 nm. This 130 nm red shift is large enough that
the disappearance of the 465 nm peak can be reliably used to measure
the removal of free dye upon binding to the thin-film-immobilized
enzyme, with very little influence from the emerging 595 nm peak.

To quantify the amount of enzyme loading, the enzyme-loaded thin
film samples were submerged in 10 mL of the Bradford assay solution
inside a 45 mm(H) × 10 mm(D) × 40 mm(W) cuvette that was
continuously stirred. This extra wide cuvette not only allows the
entire coverslip to be placed inside but also provides enough space
to ensure that the enzyme-loaded coverslip is not in the optical path
of the UV–vis spectrometer, preventing any interference from
the coverslip itself or from any dye bound to the enzyme-loaded coverslip
during the real-time absorption measurements. The Coomassie Blue dye
would bind to solution-accessible enzymes that were loaded inside
the thin film, thereby lowering the concentration of free dye in the
assay solution. By monitoring the depletion of free dye absorption
at 465 nm, the quantity of loaded enzyme that is accessible to free
dyes could be determined. The reduction in 465 nm absorbance was recorded
and then compared with a calibration curve obtained from a separate
Bradford assay using a series of known concentrations of CytC and
HRP from the same stock. This was accomplished by recording the decrease
in 465 nm absorbance while a fixed amount of enzyme was added to a
Bradford assay solution in a step-wise fashion.

Detection of
Cytochrome C in Loaded Thin Films
After
1 week of kinetic doping in a CytC loading solution, thin film samples
were removed and washed under a direct stream of running distilled
water to remove all CytC that is loosely bound to the thin film surface.
The presence of active CytC in the thin film was determined through
an ABTS solution assay. In this assay, ABTS was chosen due to its
easily observable color change (from colorless to green), ease of
storage and preparation, and a good body of existing literature about
its catalytic transformation by CytC in the presence of H2O2. The clear ABTS assay solution was prepared by adding
14 μL of 30% H2O2 to 100 mL of a 14 μM
ABTS solution made with a 10 mM, pH 7.4 PBS buffer. The resultant
H2O2 concentration in the assay solution was
1.4 mM. The assay was performed by directly submerging the CytC-loaded
thin film in the ABTS assay solution. The presence of active CytC
in the silica film could be observed visually from the appearance
of green products on the surface of the coverslip, with the green
products slowly diffusing into the once colorless assay solution.

Detection of Horseradish Peroxidase in Loaded Thin Films
Similar to the CytC-loaded thin films, the HRP-loaded coverslips
were removed after 1 week of kinetic doping in a HRP loading solution,
which were then washed with distilled water to remove loosely bound
enzymes. The presence of thin-film-loaded HRP was verified by a guaiacol
solution assay. Guaiacol was chosen for the assay because of the dramatic
color change from colorless to dark brown as it was catalytically
oxidized into the dimeric and tetrameric quinone products by HRP in
the presence of H2O2. The color change is easily
observable even to the naked eye. The guaiacol assay solution is a
mixture of 1.4 μL of 30% H2O2 and 3.3
μL of liquid guaiacol in 100 mL of a 10 mM, pH 7.4 PBS buffer.
The resultant H2O2 and guaiacol concentrations
in the assay solution are 140 and 300 μM, respectively. To prevent
the inactivation of HRP by excess H2O2, low
H2O2 concentration was deliberately used in
the design of this assay. In this assay, the stoichiometric ratio
between H2O2 and guaiacol was kept slightly
below 1.0 to favor catalytic dimer formation. The assay was carried
out by directly submerging the HRP-loaded thin film into the clear
guaiacol assay solution. Subsequently, the presence of active HRP
could be visually confirmed by the formation of brown quinone products
on the thin film surface, which then gradually diffuse outward and
spread through the once colorless assay solution.

Quantification
of HRP Catalytic Activity
The catalytic
activity of thin-film-immobilized HRP was determined by following
the rate of product formation in a HRP/guaiacol assay reaction. The
reaction was monitored in real time via the increase in the quinone
product absorption at 436 nm under continuous stirring. To compare
the activity of free and thin-film-bound HRP, the same experiment
was repeated for the same quantity of both free HRP and HRP loaded
in a thin film. The activity of HRP was calculated from the initial
rate method that utilizes the linear portion of the 436 nm absorbance
time course captured.
