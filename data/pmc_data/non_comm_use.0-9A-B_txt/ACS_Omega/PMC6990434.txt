In this study, a highly sensitive
and specific monoclonal antibody
(mAb) against azaperone was produced. The mAb belonged to the IgG2b
subtype and its half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 0.46 ng/mL. The limit of detection value was 0.081 ng/mL and
the linear range (IC20–IC80) was 0.165–1.29
ng/mL. Based on this anti-azaperone mAb, a colloidal gold immunochromatographic
strip assay method was established for the detection of azaperone
in pork and pork liver samples. For pork samples, the cutoff value
of the colloidal gold immunochromatographic strip assay was 10 ng/g,
and the cutoff value was also 10 ng/g in pig liver samples. This colloidal
gold immunochromatographic strip assay is a rapid, simple, and practical
method for the detection of azaperone in pork and pork liver samples
available in markets.

==== Body
Introduction
Azaperone (Figure 1)
is an important butylphenol–benzene
neurotranquilizer used in the veterinary clinic.1 It has several related nerve-stabilizing effects on farm
livestock. Intramuscular injection of this drug is used to relieve
tension in animals and reduce their activity.2−4 It can make
animals indifferent to their environment and keep them in a quiet
state for a long term, which is conducive to avoiding fighting when
animals live together and in mixed groups. Therefore, it is often
used for animals such as pigs during long-distance transportation.5−8 With the widespread application of this drug in veterinary medicine,9 the problem of its residue in animal tissues
and the direct harm to human health caused by its toxic side effects
have attracted extensive attention. Through the food chain, azaperone
still accumulates in the human body, causing a series of adverse reactions
such as cardiovascular effects, decreased arterial pressure, skin
vasodilation, and heart rate reduction. The maximum residue limits
(MRLs) of animal foods in China stipulate that the MRLs of azaperone
and its metabolite azaperol in the muscle, skin and fat, liver, and
kidney of pigs are 60, 60, 100 and 100 mg/kg, respectively.

Currently reported detection methods include enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay,10 liquid chromatography (LC)–tandem
mass spectrometry,11 LC,12 and high performance LC.13 Although
these instrumental methods have high sensitivity and accuracy, they
are not suitable for the measurement of large numbers of samples.
Compared with the instrumental methods, the colloidal gold (CG) immunochromatographic
strip detection method is portable and suitable for on-site detection.
In this study, a CG immunochromatographic strip detection method was
developed for the detection for azaperone in pork and pork liver.

Results
and Discussion
Verification of Hapten
In order
to enable the small
molecule to be coupled with carrier protein and possess strong immunogenicity,
a linker arm with four carbon atoms and an active carboxyl group were
introduced to the side of the hapten. An appropriate length of the
linker arm can highlight the characteristic structure of the hapten,
which was beneficial to the generation of high-specificity antibodies.

As shown in Figure 4, the mass spectrogram showed a relative mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 394, and the relative molecular
weight of the corresponding component was 395 (m/z). Because of the negative ion mode, the relative molecular
weight of the fragment molecule with a relative molecular weight of
335 (m/z) was consistent with the
relative molecular weight of the hapten of Azap, which indicated that
the hapten of Azap was successfully derived. The structure of hapten
was further confirmed by 1H NMR spectra.

(m, 2 H).

Identification of the Immunogen and Coating Antigen
The derived azaperone was an incomplete antigen, which was only antigenic
but not immunogenic when present alone. The hapten was not immunogenic
until it was coupled with carrier proteins, such as bovine serum albumin
(BSA) and keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). In this study, the hapten
Azap was coupled with KLH as an immunogen, and a UV–vis spectrophotometer
was used to characterize the conjugates. The UV–vis spectra
of hapten, proteins, and conjugates are shown in Figure 5b,c. The hapten Azap had a
strong absorption peak at 250 nm and another weak absorption peak
at 300–310 nm. The carrier protein KLH had absorption peaks
at 278 and 350 nm, and ovalbumin (OVA) had an absorption peak at 278
nm. The conjugate Azap–KLH possessed three characteristic absorption
peaks. One of the absorption peaks was at 250 nm, which reflected
the hapten. The other two absorption peaks were located at 278 and
350 nm, respectively, which reflected the carrier protein KLH in conjugates.
The conjugate Azap–OVA had two absorption peaks at 250 and
278 nm, which were similar to those of Azap hapten and carrier protein
OVA. Accordingly, the conjugates of immunogen Azap–KLH and
coating antigen Azap–OVA were successfully coupled with carrier
proteins.

of coating antigen (Azap–OVA).

Characterization of mAbs
The subtypes of mAbs against
azaperone are shown in Figure 6a. Obviously, the mAb belonged to the subtype of IgG2b. As
shown in Figure 6b,
the indirect competitive inhibition curve was drawn with logarithmic
values of standard concentrations of azaperone plotted on the abscissa
and absorbance values at 450 nm on the ordinate. The equation of the
standard curve was obtained, which was y = 0.0895
± 0.1151 + (1.5514 ± 0.06686–0.0895 ± 0.1151)/(1
+ (x/0.46139 ± 0.07759)1.34972±0.24747). The IC50 of the mAb was 0.46 ng/mL, the limit of detection
(LOD) value was 0.081 ng/mL, and the linear range (IC20–IC80) was 0.165–1.29 ng/mL. When the CR
rate of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) was less than 10%, it can be regarded
as showing no cross-reactivity (CR). As shown in Table 1, the CR data of the mAb against
azaperone indicated that this mAb was a highly specific mAb because
all the CR rates were less than 10%.

Analysis of Azaperone in
Pork and Pig Liver Samples
In order to verify the feasibility
of the CG immunochromatographic
strip assay, different concentrations of azaperone were added to pork
and pork liver samples for analysis using the CG immunochromatographic
strip. The pork and pork liver samples were spiked with the azaperone
standard before extraction. As shown in Figure 7a, the pork samples were spiked with azaperone
(0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 ng/g). It was obvious that the color of
the T line began to change when the azaperone standard concentration
was 0.5 ng/g. With increasing concentration of the azaperone standard,
the color of the T line gradually disappeared. Ultimately, no color
was observed at an azaperone standard concentration of 10 ng/g. In
this study, the cutoff value was defined as the value at which the
T line color could no longer be seen by the naked eye. Therefore,
the cutoff value of azaperone in pork samples was 10 ng/g. As shown
in Figure 7b, the pork
liver samples were spiked with different concentrations of the azaperone
standard (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 ng/g) and the cutoff value observable
by the naked eye was also 10 ng/g.

Conclusions
In
this study, a mAb against azaperone was developed through the
interaction of the immunogen and coating antigen. Subsequently, a
CG immunochromatographic strip assay was established for the detection
of azaperone in different samples. The study confirmed that the CG
immunochromatographic strip assay method is feasible for the detection
of azaperone in pork and pork liver samples.

Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China), a water bath (Shanghai Instrument Group
Co. Ltd., Supply and Sales Co., Shanghai, China), a Multiskan MKS

phase: from 90% water (0.05% ACS) and 10% CH3CN (0.05%
FA) to 5% water (0.05% ACS) and 95% CH3CN (0.05% FA) in
6.0 min, finally under these conditions for 0.5 min.

Synthesis of
Hapten
A new type of hapten coupled with
structural spacer arms was synthesized based on a previously reported
method14,15 (Figure 2). Briefly, methyl 4-phenylbutanoate (1.00 g), 4-chlorobutanol
chloride (1.19 g), and aluminum trichloride (1.50 g) were dissolved
in 10 mL carbon disulfide. The reaction was warmed to room temperature
and stirred overnight. Then, the mixture was poured into ice water,
extracted with DCM, dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated
to give methyl 4-[4-(4-chlorobutanoyl)phenyl]butanoate (compound 2)
as a yellow oil. Next, compound 2 (1.20 g), potassium iodide (98.50
mg), and potassium carbonate (1.17 g) in acetonitrile (12 mL) were
added to 1-(pyridin-2-yl) piperazine (700 mg). The reaction was heated
at 70 °C overnight. After the reaction finished, the mixture
was cooled with ice water, extracted with DCM, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated. The residue was purified using
a silica column to give methyl 4-(4-(4-(4-(pyridin-2-yl)piperazin-1-yl)butanoyl)
phenyl) butanoate (compound 3) as a yellow oil. Then compound 3 (360
mg) and lithium hydroxide (90.20 mg) were added into THF (3 mL) and
H2O (1 mL), warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight.
The aqueous phase was acidified with aqueous HCl until it reached
pH 6.0 and washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated to give 4-(4-(4-(4-(pyridin-2-yl)piperazin-1-yl)butanoyl)phenyl)butanoic
acid (compound 4) as a white solid, which was the hapten of azaperone,
and the yield of hapten was 71.8%. The hapten was characterized by
means of LC–MS and 1H NMR.

Preparation of Immunogen
and Coating Antigen
The hapten
was conjugated with KLH and OVA as the immunogen and coating antigen,
respectively. The active ester method16,17 was used to
synthesize the immunogen (Azap–KLH) and coating antigen (Azap–OVA).
Azap (1.9 mg) was dissolved in 400 μL of DMF with NHS (1.4 mg).
Then, EDC (2.2 mg) dissolved in BB solution was added dropwise into
the reaction. After the mixture was stirred for 6 h at room temperature,
the active hapten was added slowly into a solution of KLH (10 mg in
1.8 mL PBS and 1.2 mL BB at pH 8.8) and constantly stirred overnight
at room temperature to finish the conjugation of hapten and KLH. The
Azap–KLH conjugate was dialyzed against PBS for 48 h with a
solution change every 8 h to remove uncoupled hapten, then stored
at −20 °C until use. According to Lambert–Beer’s
law, the coupling rate of small molecular hapten with KLH was 78.
The approach to coating antigens was as described above. The conjugates
were verified by ultraviolet spectroscopy.

Production of mAb Against
Azaperone
Ten female BALB/c
mice (6–8 weeks of age) were immunized with the immunogen (Azap–KLH).18 The mice were immunized by subcutaneous injection
of the antigen and FCA after emulsification.19,20 FCA was used for the first immunization (100 μg per mouse)
and FIA was used for the booster immunization (50 μg per mouse).21,22 Antiserum titer and inhibition were screened by ic-ELISA. The mouse
with the highest titer which showed competitive inhibition with azaperone
was selected for cell fusion. Twenty-five microgram of immunogen was
injected intraperitoneally into the mouse in the first three days
of cell fusion.

Mouse spleen cells and myeloma cells were fused
using polyethylene glycol.23 The titer
of cells was detected by ic-ELISA. The inhibitory effect of a positive
cell line on the target drug was further determined by ic-ELISA. The
cell line with the best inhibitory activity was subcloned three times
by the limited dilution method. Ultimately, a mAb hybridoma cell line
against azaperone was screened. Hybridoma cell lines were injected
into the abdominal cavity of mice to produce ascites, and the mAb
was purified by the octanoic acid-saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation
method.24,25 The yield (Y field, mg/mL) is the amount
of antibody extracted per milliliter of ascites, and in this study,
the yield was 3 mg antibody extracted per milliliter of ascites (3
mg/mL). After dialysis against PBS for 3 days at 4 °C, mAbs were
stored at −20 °C.

Characterization of mAbs
The subtype of the mAb was
identified using a mouse mAb isotyping ELISA kit. The IC50 and LOD value of the mAb were used to estimate sensitivity, which
was obtained from an indirect competitive inhibition curve. The specificity
of the mAb was identified by evaluating its CR with structural analogues
of azaperol, haloperidol, spiperone, and droperidol. The indirect
competitive inhibition curve of these drugs was drawn by using the
same coating antigen and mAb as the standard substance. The cross
reaction rates were calculated according to the following formula,
CR (%) = (IC50 of Azap mAb/IC50 of structural
analogues) × 100%

Preparation of CG-Labelled mAbs
CG was synthesized
by the trisodium citrate reduction method as reported previously.26,27 In brief, 100 mL of 0.1% chloroauric acid solution was added to
a 200 mL conical bottle and placed on an electromagnetic stirring
furnace. The solution was stirred and heated to the boiling point.
Then, 4 mL of 1% trisodium citrate solution was added to the boiling
solution, which was continuously heated and stirred for 15 min. The
heat source was then removed until the color of the boiling solution
changed to wine red. After continued stirring for 20 min, the solution
was cooled to room temperature and the CG solution obtained was stored
at 4 °C until use.

Under conditions in which the isoelectric
point of immunoglobulin (mAb) was slightly alkaline, the CG was able
to firmly bind to the antibodies. First, 1 mL CG solution was adjusted
to pH 8.0 with 0.1 M K2CO3 and 8 μg of
mAb against azaperone was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature
for 50 min and mixed with 1 mL of 10% (w/v) BSA solution for occlusion
and stabilization. The solution was stirred for 1 h at room temperature,
and centrifuged at 10 000g for 30 min at 4
°C. The supernatant was discarded, while the pellet was resuspended
in 2 mL of 10 mM resuspension buffer (20 mM pH 8.2 Tris, 0.1% PEG,
0.1% Tween, 5% sucrose, 5% trehalose, and 0.2% BSA) three times. Finally,
the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of the same resuspension buffer
and stored at 4 °C until use.

Assembly of the CG Immunochromatographic
Strip
A schematic
diagram showing the CG immunochromatographic strip is presented in Figure 3a. Based on the PVC
backing card, an NC membrane used as the carrier was located in the
center of the PVC backing card. The absorption pad and the sample
pad were attached to either end of the PVC backing card, and the gold
pad was located between the sample pad and the NC membrane, overlapping
the NC membrane or the sample pad by 2 mm. The control line (C line)
and test line (T line) were placed on the NC membrane, and sprayed
with goat antimouse IgG or the coating antigen, respectively. The
sample pad was immersed in 0.01 M pH 7.4 PBS containing 1% BSA and
0.2% Tween 20 and dried at 37 °C. Finally, the assembled strip
card was cut into strips (3 mm width), and stored for use.

Detection
Procedure and Principle
The sample pad was
immersed in the liquid sample solution and incubated at room temperature
for 5 min, and the mixed liquid migrated slowly toward the absorption
pad through capillary action. Because of the color reaction of CG,
the results could be observed with the naked eye in 5–8 min.28

The principle of a CG immunochromatographic
strip is presented in Figure 3b. In negative samples, the CG-labelled mAb shifts to the
absorption pad with the solution, and then specifically binds to the
coating antigen on the T line and the goat antimouse IgG on the C
line. It can then be observed that both T and C lines turn red. In
positive samples, the CG-labelled mAb binds with the target object.
As the number of target objects increases, the amount of uncoupled
CG-labelled mAb decreases, resulting in a lighter T line color.29

Sample Pretreatment and Analysis
Azaperone is a neuroleptic,
which is commonly used in pigs. Consequently pork and pork liver were
purchased from a local supermarket as samples for detection. Appropriate
adjustments had been made to the methods reported in the references
to the pretreatment process.4,30 Briefly, 2.00 g homogenized
pork was weighed and put into a 50 mL centrifuge tube, then mixed
with 10 mL acetonitrile. The mixture was whirled, oscillated at 824g for 5 min and ultrasonicated for 2 min at room temperature.
The insoluble material and supernatant were isolated by centrifugation
at 4750g for 5 min, and then 10 mL acetonitrile was
added to the residue for repeated extraction. The supernatant obtained
from the two extractions were merged together. The supernatant was
dried under nitrogen in a water bath at 50 °C. Subsequently,
the extract was redissolved in 2 mL PBS for analysis.

The samples
were spiked with different concentrations of azaperone before extraction,
and tested using the CG immunochromatographic strip assay.
