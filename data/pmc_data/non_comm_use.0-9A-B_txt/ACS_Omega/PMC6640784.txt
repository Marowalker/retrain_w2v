Voltammetric
dealloying is a typical method to synthesize Pt-shell/less-noble
metal (M) alloy core nanoparticles (NPs) toward the oxygen reduction
reaction (ORR). The pristine nanostructures of the Pt–M alloy
NPs should determine the ORR activity of the dealloyed NPs. In this
study, we investigated the voltammetric dealloying behavior of the
Pt–Co and nitrogen-introduced Pt–Co alloy NPs generated
by synchronous arc-plasma deposition of Pt and Co. The results showed
that the dealloying behavior is sensitive to cobalt nitride in the
pristine NPs, leading to the preferential generation of a Pt-rich
shell/Pt–Co alloy core architecture having enhanced ORR activity.

1 Introduction
Proton-exchange-membrane
fuel cells (PEMFCs) are promising energy
conversion systems, particularly in the case of fuel cell vehicle
applications. However, the slow kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction
(ORR) that proceeds at the cathode requires a large amount of Pt as
an electrocatalyst, which represents a major obstacle to the widespread
adoption of PEMFCs. Pt-based alloy nanoparticles (NPs) containing
transition metals (Pt–M, where M = Co, Fe, Ni, Pd, etc.) have
attracted particular attention, primarily because of their superior
ORR activity per unit mass of Pt, that is, their Pt mass activity
toward the ORR.1 The mass activity enhancement
of the Pt–M alloy catalysts is largely attributable to the
lattice strain (geometric) and ligand (electronic) effects,2,3 which depend upon the surface morphologies and near-surface Pt/M
alloy compositions. Numerous studies published to date clearly show
that optimum nanostructural control of the Pt–M NPs is essential
to maximize the enhancement in the activity toward the ORR.

Dealloying is an effective method to synthesize highly ORR-active-structured
NPs such as alloy nanoframes.4 Dealloying
can be achieved through either of two mechanisms: selective less-noble
metal surface dissolution and Pt-rich shell layer construction. Therefore,
the nanostructures generated using the dealloying process should be
strongly influenced by the structures of the pristine Pt–M
alloy NPs used as starting materials, for example, their surface roughness,5 alloy composition,6−8 and particle size.9,10 Strasser et al. have demonstrated that core–shell-structured
NPs with a Pt-rich shell surrounding a Pt–M alloy core formed
through voltammetric dealloying and exhibit very high ORR activity.6 Although core–shell-structured NPs have
been extensively studied, the critical problem of insufficient stability
of these materials under PEMFC operating conditions, that is, the
durability of the core–shell NPs, remains unsettled. To stabilize
the core–shell structures, several groups have focused on nitridation
of the Pt–M alloy core.11−13 For example, Adzic and co-workers
reported that Pt–M alloy cores could be stabilized through
nitrogen bonding of M.14 Because dealloying
behaviors of the Pt–M NPs should be determined by the less-noble
M dissolution accompanied by the surface diffusion of Pt atoms, the
nitridation of the Pt–M alloy core should strongly influence
the core dissolution behavior. However, at present, the role of nitrogen
in the Pt–M NP systems remains unclear.

The arc-plasma
deposition (APD) method is one of the physical vapor
deposition techniques used to synthesize monodispersed metal or alloy
NPs without introducing any organic impurities.15 Because the amounts of deposited materials can be easily
controlled via the arc voltage and through pulse repetitions, the
APD-fabricated NPs are expected to be suitable for evaluating the
relationship between the nanostructures and the electrocatalytic behaviors.
Indeed, we have previously reported the electrochemical (EC) properties
of APD-fabricated Pt-based alloy catalysts, where we investigated
the relationship between the ORR activities and the nanostructures
of Pt–Ni NP-stacking thin films7 and Au-modified Pt NPs.16,17 Furthermore, because
APD conducted under a reactive gas atmosphere can induce chemical
reactions between a transition metal and the activated reactive gas,
the EC properties of the Pt–M NPs can easily be modified through
precise control of the reactive gas pressure during APD. Actually,
Ohnishi and co-workers demonstrated through the APD of niobium (Nb)
under controlled partial pressures of N2 and O2 that finely dispersed Nb oxynitride-like species can be synthesized
on the graphite substrate.18 In the aforementioned
context, we here investigated the voltammetric dealloying behaviors
of Pt–Co alloy NPs generated in the presence (PtCo with N2) and absence (PtCo w/o N2) of N2 by
synchronous APD of Pt and Co.

2 Results and Discussion
The diffraction patterns for 2θ angles from 38° to 46°
are presented in Figure 1A (whole 2θ patterns ranging from 20° to 80° are
presented in Figure S1). A diffraction
peak for both samples present around 41.7° is assigned to the
(111) peak of face-centered cubic (fcc) PtCo (ICCD #03-065-8970),
indicating that the prepared samples are mostly composed of a solid
solution of PtCo alloy with an fcc crystal structure. The diffraction
peak of PtCo with N2 emerged at a lower angle compared
to that of PtCo w/o N2: the peak shift is probably caused
by the expansion of a Pt–Co fcc lattice by interstitial nitrogen
atoms in the alloy NPs (as Table S1).

and with N2 (pink). The blue vertical line indicates the
(111) peak positions of Pt. XPS spectra of (B) N 1s, (C) Co 2p, and
(D) Pt 4f regions for the PtCo w/o N2 (black) and with
N2 (pink) NPs. The peaks correspond to N1: pyridinic-N,
N2: Co-Nx, N3: pyrrolic-N,
N4: graphitic-N, and N5: nitric oxide for the
N 1s region; Co1: Co(0), Co2: CoxOy, Co3: Co-Nx, Co4: satellites for the Co 2p
region; and Pt1: Pt(0) and Pt2: Pt(II) for the
Pt 4f region.

The X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of N 1s (Figure 1B: 405–395
eV), Co 2p (Figure 1C: 802–774 eV), and Pt 4f (Figure 1D: 78–70 eV) regions for the as-prepared
PtCo w/o N2 (black) and PtCo with N2 (pink)
are summarized. The N 1s band in the spectrum of PtCo with N2 can be deconvoluted into five components: pyridinic-N (398.0 eV),
Co-Nx (399.9 eV), pyrrolic-N (400.4 eV),
graphic-N (401.0 eV), and nitric oxide (404.0 eV).19−21 The Co-Nx peak provides strong evidence for Co–N
bond generation; the other nitrogen-related peaks are attributed to
C–N bonds formed through nitridation of the highly oriented
pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) substrate surface. Ohnishi et al. deduced
that these incidental products (C–N bonds) synthesized through
the reactive-APD of Nb on the HOPG substrate contribute little to
the ORR.18 Thus, we are not concerned with
the influence of the C–N incidental products. In the Co 2p
region, deconvolution revealed peaks at 778.5, 780.1, and 781.5 eV;
these peaks are assigned to Co(0), cobalt oxide, and Co-Nx, respectively.22 By contrast,
the peak positions of the Pt 4f doublet for both PtCo samples were
almost identical. Specifically, each doublet was deconvoluted into
two chemically different diverse valence states, that is, metallic
Pt(0) and oxidized Pt(II). The integrated intensity ratio between
the Pt(II) and Pt(0) peaks increased after nitridation of the Co atoms
in the PtCo alloy NPs, implying that the Pt electronic structure was
modified by the introduction of nitrogen into the Pt–Co alloy
system. In any event, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Figure 1A) and XPS (Figure 1B–D) results confirm
that Co nitridation was achieved by synchronous APD of Pt and Co under
an N2 partial pressure of 0.1 Pa.

The samples were
electrochemically dealloyed by being cycled between
0.05 and 1.05 V for 300 cycles at 500 mV s–1 in
N2-purged 0.1 M HClO4 using a triangular wave
potential. Figure 2 presents scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images and the corresponding
particle-size distributions of PtCo w/o N2 (top) and with
N2 (bottom) before (left) and after (right) voltammetric
dealloying. The STM images show well-dispersed NPs with almost the
same mean particle size (approximately 5 nm) for both as-prepared
(before dealloying) samples. The estimated mean particle size corresponds
well to the crystallite size estimated from the XRD patterns (Table S1). The results show that
there is little influence of Co nitridation on the average diameters
of the samples. By contrast, the STM image and particle-size distribution
of the dealloyed PtCo w/o N2 differed substantially from
those of the dealloyed PtCo with N2; the reduction in the
particle size of PtCo with N2 (5.3–4.5 nm) was suppressed
in comparison with that of PtCo w/o N2 (4.8–3.5
nm) using the voltammetric dealloying process.

Figure 2 STM images (100 ×
100 nm2) and particle-size distributions
of PtCo w/o N2 (top) and with N2 (bottom) before
(left) and after (right) voltammetric dealloying.

To determine the alloy compositions of the PtCo NPs, we used
high-angle
annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM)
equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDS) apparatus. In the EDS
line profile of the dealloyed PtCo w/o N2 (Figure 3, left top), the Co profile
(green) is significantly less intense than the Pt profile (blue),
indicating that the dealloying of Co proceeds deeper into the particle
bulk. By contrast, as shown in the EDS line profile of the dealloyed
PtCo with N2 (Figure 3, right top), the EDS intensity of Co stands in comparison
with that of Pt. A HAADF-STEM image of PtCo with N2 (right
bottom) shows a bright Pt-enriched shell on a relatively darker PtCo
alloy core (the region inside of the yellow-dotted circle). On the
basis of the STEM image of PtCo with N2, the thickness
of the Pt-enriched layer can be estimated to be approximately 0.9–1.2
nm (3–4 atomic layers). On the basis of the EDS spectra for
several particles in the HAADF-STEM images of PtCo w/o N2 and with N2 (Figure S2), the
average Pt/Co ratios of the dealloyed PtCo w/o N2 and with
N2 were estimated to be approximately 80:20 and 42:58,
respectively, as listed in Table 1. Thus, the results of STM (Figure 2) and HAADF-STEM (Figure 3) observation indicate that the nitridation
of Co in the PtCo alloy NP system might suppress Co dissolution through
the dealloying process, resulting in different dealloyed NP structures.
The voltammetric dealloying mechanism will be further discussed in
the following section.

As shown in Figure 4A, a cyclic voltammogram (CV) of the dealloyed PtCo
with N2 enlarged when compared with that of the dealloyed
PtCo w/o N2: shapes of the CVs correspond well to the results
reported
for PtCo9 and PtCoN13 in the literature. Furthermore, the linear sweep voltammograms
collected at 1600 rpm (Figure 4B) show that the half-wave potential of PtCo with N2 shifts positively when compared with that of PtCo w/o N2, indicating the enhanced ORR activity for the former sample. We
used Koutecky–Levich plots to estimate the Pt mass activities
on the basis of the kinetic controlled currents at 0.9 V (vs RHE);
the results are summarized in Figure 4C. The Pt mass activities of the dealloyed PtCo w/o
N2 (black) and with N2 (pink) are 1.1 and 1.8
A mg–1 Pt, respectively: the ORR enhancement factors
for the dealloyed samples are higher than the average Pt mass activity
for a typical commercial Pt/C catalyst (gray).12,14,23 The EC surface area (ECSA) values for the
dealloyed PtCo w/o N2 and with N2 were estimated
to be 0.070 and 0.109 cm2, corresponding to 108 and 169
m2 g–1 Pt, respectively. Thus, respective
area-specific ORR activities are 1.0 and 1.1 mA cm–2 ECSA, respectively. At any rate, the dealloyed PtCo with N2 sample is more ORR-active than the dealloyed PtCo w/o N2. XPS spectra of the Co 2p bands for both dealloyed samples are presented
in Figure 4D: the Co
2p bands are almost identical, irrespective of Co nitridation. After
the dealloying process, the existence of Co nitride in the core of
PtCo with N2 NPs is excluded; that is, the XPS results
for the dealloyed samples (Figure 4D) suggest the dissolution of the Co–N bonds
and/or the detachment of the introduced N atoms in the core during
the voltammetric dealloying process. Furthermore, the Pt/Co atomic
ratio estimated from the XPS spectrum for the dealloyed NPs of PtCo
with N2 increases from 1.5 to 8 through the dealloying
process, indicating the enrichment of Pt at near-surface regions.
Consequently, the results obtained in this study show that the Pt
mass activity enhancement of PtCo with N2 could be caused
by the enlargement of the specific surface area and the preferential
formation of the core–shell architecture through the consumption
of not only Co atoms but also cobalt nitride in the pristine core
during the voltammetric dealloying process.

Given the potential window used in our experiments (0.05–1.05
V), the oxygenated adsorption/desorption behaviors should modify the
voltammetric dealloying process.24 Thus,
we here discuss the structural dependence of the pristine nitrogen-introduced
Pt–Co alloy core on the oxygen-related adsorbates. The XRD
results (Figure 1A)
provide strong evidence that Co nitride and/or doped N atoms in the
core exist as interstitial solutes, thereby expanding the PtCo lattices.
Such a lattice expansion should relax the compressive strain of the
Pt-rich shell in the initial stage of dealloying. The compressive
strain on the Pt-rich shell surface is well-known to increase with
decreasing amounts of the oxygen-related species adsorbed onto the
surface of the Pt atoms.2 The desorption
of the oxygen-related adsorbates by cathodic sweep induces the replacement
of the surface Pt atoms to eliminate the difference in the surface
energy.26 Indeed, Sasaki et al. showed
that “place exchange” at the surface of Pt NPs should
occur at relatively low potential such as 0.91 V.25 Therefore, the surface Pt atoms might be replaced through
place exchange under voltammetric dealloying conditions. Consequently,
the nitrogen in the core should lead to less compressive strain of
the Pt-rich shell, accompanied by the activation of Pt surface diffusion,
during the voltammetric dealloying process. Furthermore, the introduced
nitrogen is expected to affect the EC stability of Co in the core.
According to the literature, the electrode oxidation (dissolution)
current for the amorphous CoxN electrode
begins at much more positive potentials than that for Co metal.27 Furthermore, Zhong et al. carried out density
functional theory calculations that showed that the oxygenated adsorption
of Co4N was weaker than that of the Co metal.20 Because the adsorption of oxygen-related species
onto the Pt-based alloy surface tends to induce the surface segregation
of the less-noble metals,28 Co nitridation
might contribute to the preferential formation of the core–shell
architecture. On the basis of the previous discussions, we illustrated
schematics of the voltammetric dealloying behaviors of the PtCo w/o
N2 (left) and with N2 (right) NPs during anodic
(left) and cathodic (right) scans (Figure 4E). Published studies clearly reveal that
the extent of the dealloying of the Pt-based alloy NPs is largely
controlled by the ratio (R) between the Pt surface
diffusion and the less-noble metal dissolution rates.10,29 Therefore, the introduced nitrogen atoms in the core might increase
the value of R, resulting in the preferential multilayered
Pt-rich shell/Pt–Co alloy core formation for PtCo with N2 through the consumption of the introduced nitrogen atoms
in the core.

3 Conclusions
We investigated
the voltammetric dealloying of PtCo with N2 and w/o N2 samples fabricated by the synchronous
APD of Pt and Co. The XRD and XPS results provided strong evidence
for Co nitridation in the core for the synchronous APD-PtCo NPs under
an N2 partial pressure of 0.1 Pa. The morphologies and
nanostructures of the dealloyed PtCo samples were observed using STM
and STEM, indicating that the N atoms introduced into the pristine
core (PtCo with N2) contribute to the preferential multilayered
Pt-rich shell/Pt–Co core formation through voltammetric dealloying.
The ORR activity of the dealloyed PtCo with N2 was 1.6
times greater than that of the dealloyed PtCo w/o N2. The
results obtained in this study demonstrate that the introduction of
nitrogen into the pristine Pt–M alloy NPs is a key factor in
controlling the core–shell nanostructures via voltammetric
dealloying.

4 Experimental Details
4.1 Sample
Fabrication
Synchronous APD
using two APD sources (ULVAC-RIKO ARL-300) was used to synthesize
the Pt–Co alloy NPs on the HOPG (Optigraph) substrates (10
× 10 mm2; thickness: 1 mm) under ultrahigh vacuum
(∼10–8 Pa) for the Pt–Co NPs (denoted
as PtCo w/o N2) or under an N2 partial pressure
of 0.1 Pa (denoted as PtCo with N2). The substrate temperature
during APD was maintained at 773 K to control the size distributions
and morphologies of the NPs. Using a quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM)
installed in the APD chamber, we estimated the amounts of the deposited
Pt and Co normalized to the HOPG geometric area to be approximately
0.57 μg cm–2 HOPG (Pt) and 0.34 μg cm–2 HOPG (Co).

4.2 EC Studies
The
APD-fabricated samples
were transferred from the APD chamber to an EC measurement setup in
an N2-purged glove box without air exposure. A potentiostat
with a rotating disk electrode (RDE) system (Hokuto Denko HZ-5000)
was used for the EC measurements. The voltammetric dealloying and
EC measurements were taken using a glass cell that included a Pt counter
electrode and a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under flowing
H2 gas. The electrolyte solution was prepared from perchloric
acid (HClO4; Sigma-Aldrich, Ultrapure) and Milli-Q water.
The samples were electrochemically dealloyed by being cycled between
0.05 and 1.05 V for 300 cycles at 500 mV s–1 in
N2-purged 0.1 M HClO4 using a triangular wave
potential. The EC properties for the dealloyed PtCo NPs were evaluated
by cyclic voltammetry in N2-purged 0.1 M HClO4 at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1 and by linear sweep
voltammetry performed using the RDE in O2-saturated 0.1
M HClO4 at a scan rate of 10 mV s–1.
The ECSA was estimated
from the hydrogen adsorption values in the potential region from 0.08
to 0.38 V, and the charge for the monolayer hydrogen adsorption was
assumed to be 210 μC cm–2. We used Koutecky–Levich
plots to estimate the Pt mass activities on the basis of the kinetic
controlled currents at 0.9 V (vs RHE).

4.3 Characterization
XRD patterns for
the corresponding as-prepared samples were obtained on a X-ray diffractometer
(Rigaku SmartLab) operating at 9 kW (45 kV, 200 mA) using Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm). The samples for XRD measurements
were prepared on an amorphous carbon-coated glass plate; the deposition
amounts were approximately 16 times greater than those of the samples
used for other structural observations. XPS was performed using a
VG Microtech Multilab XPS system (Thermo Electron, Thermo VG). The
APD-fabricated samples were transferred from the APD chamber to the
XPS analysis chamber under an ambient atmosphere. The sample morphologies
of the Pt–Co alloy NPs on the substrate before and after the
cycles were observed using STM (Bruker multimode V) in air. The NP
distributions were calculated from the corresponding STM images using
the ImageJ analysis software. The Pt–Co alloy NP microstructures
prepared on the amorphous carbon thin films were examined using a
HAADF-STEM (JEOL JEM-ARM200F) equipped with an EDS apparatus.
