Magnetic nanoparticles
are widely used in biomedical and oil-well
applications in aqueous, often harsh environments. The pursuit for
high-saturation magnetization together with high stability of the
molecular coating that prevents agglomeration and oxidation remains
an active research area. Here, we report a detailed analysis of the
criteria for the stability of molecular coatings in aqueous environments
along with extensive first-principles calculations for magnetite,
which has been widely used, and cementite, a promising emerging candidate.
A key result is that the simple binding energies of molecules cannot
be used as a definitive indicator of relative stability in a liquid
environment. Instead, we find that H+ ions and water molecules
facilitate the desorption of molecules from the surface. We further
find that, because of differences in the geometry of crystal structures,
molecules generally form stronger bonds on cementite surfaces than
they do on magnetite surfaces. The net result is that molecular coatings
of cementite nanoparticles are more stable. This feature, together
with the better magnetic properties, makes cementite nanoparticles
a promising candidate for biomedical and oil-well applications.

Introduction
Magnetic nanoparticles
have recently attracted significant attention
in scientific and industrial communities due to their use in the fields
of catalysis,1,2 spintronics,3−6 and biomedical applications.4,7−11 More recently, such nanoparticles have also been investigated for
oil and gas applications, such as enhanced oil recovery and reservoir
characterization.12 Nanoparticles can flow
through micron-size pores across long distances in the reservoir rocks,
and their nonzero magnetic permeability acts as a contrast agent.
Therefore, tracing these contrast agents using electromagnetic (EM)
tomography technology is a promising technique to characterize the
reservoir and enhance oil recovery.12,13 The magnetic
properties of these nanoparticles, such as superparamagnetic behavior
and high magnetic susceptibility, depend on their size, shape, and
crystallinity.14−16

Nanoparticles that are used in the fields mentioned
earlier need
to be highly water-dispersible, monodisperse, have a large saturation
magnetization, remain stable, that is, retain their properties in
pertinent harsh environments. Accordingly, the synthesis of high-quality
nanoparticles that are dispersible in water17−23 has been studied widely, finding that the coating ligands play a
crucial role in the colloidal stability of nanoparticles. For example,
Milowska et al.24 demonstrated that ligand–ligand
interactions govern nanoparticle agglomeration (Au nanoparticles).
At the core of the colloidal stability, the Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek
(DLVO) theory offers a classical explanation of colloids in suspension
and has been used to predict and explain25−27 the interaction
among nanoparticles. For example, Mikelonis et al.28 used the DLVO theory to study the aggregation of coated
Ag nanoparticles on top of ceramic membranes.

An issue related
to colloidal stability is the bonding of the molecules
to the surface of the nanoparticle. The colloidal stability of the
nanoparticles may be compromised if the water itself or ions in the
aqueous environment, for example, H+, Na+, and
so forth, can cause the molecules to desorb over time. In this context,
the strength of chemical bonds between the coating molecules and the
nanoparticles has received considerable attention.29−32 However, investigations of the
bond strength in aqueous environments are rather limited in scope.33

Magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles, depending
on the synthesis method, exhibit a saturation magnetization value
in the range of 30 and 50 emu/g1,34,35 to 78 emu/g,36−39 which is 80% of the saturation magnetization in the bulk. On the
other hand, experiments have shown that cementite (Fe3C)
nanoparticles exhibit higher saturation magnetization as compared
to that of magnetite nanoparticles, up to a value of 140 emu/g.40−46 This feature makes cementite nanoparticles a promising alternative
to magnetite for the mentioned applications. Even though the electronic
and magnetic properties of cementite have been widely studied by the
theory community,47−52 the theoretical aspects of molecule desorption from cementite surfaces
in aqueous environments, which are critical for the stability of nanoparticles,
have not been investigated.

In this article, we focus on the
issue of the stability of the
chemical bonds between the coating molecules and the nanoparticles
in an acidic aqueous environment, which is common in oil wells. We
will use quantum mechanical calculations to investigate possible desorption
processes of several molecular species adsorbed on magnetite and cementite
nanoparticles in aqueous environments and examine both the binding
and desorption mechanisms. The results indicate that molecules bonded
to cementite surfaces have a higher stability than that of the same
molecules bonded to magnetite in aqueous environments, making cementite
a preferred material over magnetite, especially for oil-well applications.
More specifically, we investigated the effects of H+ and
H2O on the desorption of four molecules (acetic acid, boronic
acid, ethyl phosphate, and ethyl trihydroxy silane) from cementite
and magnetite (001) surfaces. It is important to mention that we are
not interested in the hydrophobic or hydrophilic properties of the
molecules under consideration. We are only interested in the nature
of the bond (molecule–nanoparticle) and how this bond is affected
by the aqueous environment. Our results indicate that the molecules
bind more strongly to cementite, mainly because the interatomic distances
allow more bonds to form between the molecule and the surface. We
also find that whereas water molecules by themselves compete weakly
for the adsorption sites occupied by coating molecules, H+ ions and H2O molecules together enhance the desorption
of the adsorbed molecules: the H+ ion attaches to the departing
molecule, whereas a H2O molecule attaches to the surface.
Furthermore, our results show a direct relation between the O–Fe
bond strength (the bond between the adsorbed molecule and the surface)
and the electronegativity of certain atoms in the molecule.

Results
This work is based on the following three questions: What are the
key elements ruling the bond between the molecules and the nanoparticles?
What role do the H2O molecules and H+ ions play
in the desorption of the molecules from the surface of the nanoparticle?
What type of molecule exhibits the largest stability on the surface
of the nanoparticles under liquid conditions?

We start by pointing
out that the molecules used to coat the nanoparticles
usually have long tails that create a “shell” that protects
the nanoparticle. However, according to test calculations, the length
of the tail has a negligible role in the binding of the molecule to
the surface of the nanoparticle. For example, as the tail of the acetic
acid increases by one, two, and three C atoms, the bond strength changes
by only 0.07 eV. Therefore, we can conclude that the bond strength
is not sensitive to the length of the tail and we can use molecules
with short tails. In this way, we are able to lower the computational
cost, without compromising the accuracy. Nevertheless, there might
be other effects arising from long tails, having to do with coiling,
that we will not discus as they fall outside the scope of this article.
The four molecules considered in this work are shown in the upper
panels of Figure 1.
It is important to note that we have chosen molecules that bind to
the surfaces either in a bidentate (acetic acid and boronic acid)
or a tridentate (ethyl phosphate and ethyl trihydroxy silane) fashion.

Upon adsorption, some molecules lose all or some H atoms, depending
on the surface on which they are adsorbed. (i) Top views of the cementite
(001) surface (left) and the magnetite (001) surface (right). Primary
and secondary adsorption sites are marked with letters p and s, respectively.
In green, we show the distance between atoms or adsorption sites.
In panels (a)–(i) the red, green, black, white, purple, and
blue spheres represent the O, B, C, H, P, and Si atoms, respectively.

We first identify the most stable
adsorption configuration for
each of the molecules, and these are shown in the middle panels of Figure 1. Even though in
all cases it is energetically favorable to donate the hydrogen atoms
to the surface (dissociative adsorption), the figure shows that in
the cases of ethyl phosphate and ethyl trihidroxy silane adsorption
on magnetite, the molecules retain one hydrogen. The reason behind
it is that these two molecules are not able to bind in a tridentate
fashion to the magnetite surface. We will discuss this point further
later in the text.

Bond Strength
Once we have found
the most stable configurations,
we can move to the first goal, which is to understand the key elements
ruling the bond strength between the molecule and the surface of the
nanoparticle. To do this, we focus on how much energy is needed to
desorb the molecule from the surface in a vacuum. This can be achieved
using the following equation 1  where Esurf, Emol–surf, and Emol denote the energies of the relaxed surface, the molecule
adsorbed on the surface (as shown in Figure 1e–h), and the molecule in vacuum,
respectively. We will refer to this energy as the bond strength.

Using eq 1, we tabulated
the bond strength between the molecules and the surfaces (cementite
and magnetite) in Table 1. This table shows that whereas water molecules establish weak bonds
(0.58 and 0.72 eV) with the cementite and magnetite surfaces, the
other molecules establish strong bonds (between 3.00 and 9.29 eV).
Therefore, we can conclude that water molecules are not able to displace
the adsorbed organic molecules from the surface of either nanoparticle.

a All energies are in eV.

Table 1 also shows
that for all cases, except water, the bond strength of molecules is
larger in cementite than that of their counterparts in magnetite.
However, more interesting is the fact that in the case of cementite
the bond strength of ethyl phosphate and ethyl trihydroxy silane is
considerably higher than the bond strength of acetic acid and boronic
acid. This trend can be easily explained by looking at Figure 1e–h and noticing that
these two molecules (ethyl phosphate and ethyl trihydroxy silane)
bind to the cementite surface in a tridentate fashion, whereas the
other molecules (acetic and boronic acid) bind to the surface in a
bidentate fashion. In contrast, Figure 1 also shows that all of the molecules bind in a bidentate
fashion on the magnetite surface. As a result, the ethyl phosphate
and ethyl trihydroxy silane molecules do not exhibit a considerably
higher bond strength over that of the acetic and boronic acid molecules
on the magnetite surface, as seen in Table 1. The reason behind the difference in the
binding geometry lies in the crystal structure of the two surfaces,
as shown in Figure 1i. In the case of cementite, the distance between two neighboring
primary adsorption sites (atoms labeled with letter “p”)
is 2.5 Å, and the next primary or secondary (atoms labeled with
letter “s”) available adsorption sites are located 2.5
or 4.2 Å away (see the left hand side of Figure 1i). Because the distance between the atoms
in the ethyl phosphate and ethyl trihydroxy silane molecules is 2.6
and 2.8 Å, both molecules are able to stretch and bind in a tridentate
fashion on the cementite (001) surface. In contrast, for the magnetite
surface, the distance between two neighboring primary adsorption sites
is 2.9 Å, but the next available adsorption site is located 5.9
Å away (see the right hand side of Figure 1i). Neither the ethyl phosphate nor the ethyl
trihydroxy silane molecules are able to stretch that much. Therefore,
these two molecules can only bind to the magnetite surface in a bidentate
fashion. A similar situation is observed in other surface terminations
of cementite and magnetite; see the Supporting Information.

On the other hand, it is surprising to notice
that even though
the acetic and boronic acid molecules are very similar (differing
only in one atom) the bond strengths of these two molecules are very
different. For example, when the molecules are adsorbed on magnetite,
the bond strength differs by 1.40 eV, whereas when they are adsorbed
on cementite, the bond strength differs by 2.37 eV (see Table 1). A similar feature is seen
between ethyl phosphate and ethyl trihydroxy silane. These results
lead us to believe that it is possible to increase or decrease the
O–Fe bond strength by simply changing one atom in the molecule
that does not play a direct role in the bonding with the surface.
With this idea in mind, we took the acetic acid molecule and constructed
two more toy systems where C is replaced by N and Al. In the same
way, the P atom in the ethyl phosphate molecule was replaced by Si,
S, and Al. Then, the bond strengths, to the cementite (001) surface,
were calculated using eq 1. The results indicate that there is a clear correlation between
the bond strength (the O–Fe bond) and the electronegativity
(by Pauling scale) of the substituted atom, as shown in Figure 2a: as the electronegativity
of the atom increases, the bond strength decreases. Analogous results
were found for the magnetite surface. This is an important result
because it allows us to identify molecules that would establish the
strongest bond with the surfaces by simply looking at the properties
of the atoms. Similar results have been obtained for the adsorption
of benzene rings on graphene.53 However,
in that particular case, the binding is mainly due to van der Waals
interactions and the differences in binding energies are very small.

strength vs electronegativity. The figure shows the bond
strength of two types of molecules where one atom is being replaced
(black and red curves), as a function of electronegativity (using
the Pauling scale). The figure shows the two molecules and the atom
being replaced. (b) Desorption energies, of the four molecules under
consideration, as a function of μH (and pH) for cementite
and magnetite surfaces.

Desorption of Molecules under Liquid Conditions
Having
examined the nature of the bond between the molecules and the nanoparticle
surfaces, we focus on how a liquid environment affects the desorption
of the molecules. The first thing to take into account is that the
nanoparticles are floating in liquid water that contains H+ ions, typically in the form of H3O+ ions,
which affect the desorption process. The desorption of the molecules
assisted by water and hydrogen takes place in the following way: when
an H+ ion arrives at an adsorbed molecule, it may bind
to the molecule, which weakens the bonding to the surface. Water molecules
are always plentiful and therefore handy to assist by taking the molecule’s
place on the surface. Thus, in a cooperative fashion, the desorption
of an adsorbed organic molecule can be mediated by H+ ions
and H2O molecules. The process is thermodynamic in nature:
the initial state is an adsorbed organic molecule and a reservoir
of water molecules and H+ ions that defines their chemical
potentials. The final state is a desorbed hydrogenated organic molecule,
floating in water, and H2O molecules adsorbed in the molecule’s
place. Defining the problem in this fashion, we can calculate the
total energies of the initial and final states, using appropriate
chemical potentials to ensure that the two states have precisely the
same number of atoms. In this way, we get a lower bound for the desorption
energy because the kinetic details may entail energy barriers that
raise the net energy cost for desorption.

The number of water
molecules involved in the reaction described above depends on the
binding configuration of the molecules. For molecules that bind in
a bidentate or a tridentate fashion, two and three water molecules
are involved in the desorption process, respectively. On the other
hand, the number of hydrogen atoms involved in the reaction depends
on the pH of the system. In a system of pH 6 (slightly acid environment),
there is one H3O+ ion per 16.65 nm3 (roughly a cube of side 100 nm, which is roughly of the same
order of magnitude as the diameter of a nanoparticle). Under these
circumstances, the chance of having two hydrogen atoms assisting the
reaction is very low (second-order reaction). However, as the pH of
the system decreases, the probabilities of having more than one hydrogen
assisting the desorption process increases. For now, we will consider
only the case where one hydrogen assists the desorption of the molecules
(first-order reaction).

In the desorption process under liquid
conditions, there will be
an exchange of water and hydrogen atoms, as explained earlier. Therefore,
we need to know the energy required to withdraw water and hydrogen
atoms from the water reservoir. These energies are chemical potentials
μH and μH2O. The desorption
energy of the molecules under liquid conditions is then defined by 2  This equation assumes that,
because the body
of the molecule is surrounded by water molecules both before and after
desorption, we only need to account for the changes that occur: the
head of the molecule is initially attached to the surface, but after
desorption, the head of the molecule interacts with a layer of water
molecules, whereas water molecules take the place of the molecule
on the surface. In the equation, m denotes the number
of water molecules that are adsorbed at the newly available adsorption
sites left behind by the desorbed molecule. Emol–surf, Esurf–mH2O, and Emol–H–lH2O denote the energy of the surface with
the molecule adsorbed on it, the energy of the surface with m H2O molecules adsorbed on it, and the energy
of the desorbed molecule hydrogenated with one extra hydrogen atom
and l water molecules interacting with the molecule’s
head, respectively. In the case of acetic and boronic acids, l = 2, whereas in the case of ethyl phosphate and ethyl
trihydroxy silane, l = 3. It is important to note
that under this convention, a positive desorption energy indicates
the energy that one needs to provide to the system to desorb the molecule
from the surface with the help of water molecules and one hydrogen
atom coming from the water reservoir. It is important to point out
that under our sign convention, the μH and μH2O values are negative. Their absolute values denote
the energy needed to withdraw a hydrogen and a water molecule from
the reservoir.

Now we need to address the issue of how to calculate
μH and μH2O. μH2O is calculated by constructing a system with
32 H2O molecules in a box of 990 Å3 (the
density of water
is 1 g/cm3) and dividing the total energy by 32. We find
μH2O = −14.63 eV. For μH, we note that this is the chemical potential of a neutral
hydrogen atom, not of a H+ ion. For our purposes, it would
be perfectly fine to present our results as a function of μH, which we in fact do in Figure 2b. We will discuss these results shortly,
but because the reservoir contains H+ ions, it is useful
first to discuss how we can relate μH to μH+ because the latter is related to the pH of the
reservoir by54 3  Here, μH+0 is the proton chemical potential
at standard state (T = 25 °C and a H+ concentration of 1 mol/L), kB is the
Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. We
can evidently write μH = μH+ + μe, where μe is an effective
average chemical potential of electrons in the reservoir.

Instead
of attempting a calculation of μe, we
proceed as follows. We added an extra water molecule in our 32-molecule
supercell and dissociated it into an H+ ion and a OH– ion, placed as far apart as possible. The system is
then relaxed, whereby H+ binds to a nearby water molecule,
producing H3O+. We note that the plus and minus
superscripts are nominal. A self-consistent calculation was performed
to obtain the electronic density ρ(x) in the entire
supercell. This electronic density is obtained from pseudo-wave-functions,
but it is adequate for our purposes. We used this electronic density
to investigate the magnitude of the physical charge on each species
by integrating ρ(x) in concentric spheres of radius R about each nucleus and plotting the resulting charge Q(R) as a function of R. For comparison, we also calculated Q(R) for H in an H2 molecule in vacuum and for O in an O2 molecule in vacuum because there is no doubt that H and O
in these molecules are electrically neutral. The results are shown
in Figure 3. One surprising
result in Figure 3b
is that the physical charge in the inner core of the oxygen species
in OH, H2O, and H2O3 in the liquid
environment are essentially identical to the physical charge in the
inner core of oxygen in the O2 molecule in vacuum, that
is, the O species in a liquid environment are essentially electrically
neutral. At the same time, the physical charge on H in OH matches
the physical charge on H in the H2 molecule in vacuum (Figure 3a), that is, H in
OH in a liquid environment is essentially neutral. It follows that
the entire OH is essentially electrically neutral. We might then conclude
that the compensating H3O species is also electrically
neutral. The curves in Figure 3a, however, indicate that the charge on hydrogen atoms on
water molecules and on H3O in a liquid environment is ∼0.02
electrons smaller than that of a neutral H in a sphere of radius 0.30
Å (at longer distances, the charge is strongly influenced by
the neighboring atoms). For our purposes, we can infer that the nominally
H+ ions (H3O+ ions) are essentially
neutral, whereby the effective μe that we need to
get μH is essentially zero, that is, μH ≃ μH+. Apparently, only
a minute residual charge on the ions is responsible for the observed
ionic conductivity even in pure water (it has been shown that the
self-consistent charge on “ions” in so-called ionic
crystals is also essentially zero,55,56 even though
phenomenological charges are by construction nonzero; the “oxidation
state” reflects only orbital occupancies, not physical charge).
We emphasize that the connection between μH and pH
has no bearing on the principal results of the present article, namely,
the relative desorption energies of the molecules under study, which
we shall now describe. We will present the hydrogen- and water-assisted
desorption energies as functions of μH and use the
connection we just established between μH and pH
to express the desorption energies also as functions of pH.

Figure 3 Electronic
charge, Q(R), as a
function of the radius, R, of concentric spheres
about the nucleus of H atoms (a) and oxygen atoms (b) calculated using
the self-consistent valence pseudo-charge density of different species.
Note that for H2 in vacuum the total valence charge in
a sphere of 0.30 Å is only 0.15 electrons, which suggests that
the bulk of the two electrons in the molecule resides in the bond
region, namely, the region at the mid-point of the interatomic separation
of 0.74 Å. That bond charge is outside the spheres we employ
here to compare H in different environments. The same is true for
O–H bonds. For these bonds, the charge in the bond regions
cannot be uniquely divided into the H and O charge. Such a division
of the total charge is only possible by phenomenological schemes,
which, by construction, assign a positive charge to H and a negative
charge to O atoms.

Hydrogen- and water-assisted
desorption energies of the four molecules
under consideration, calculated using eq 2, are shown in Figure 2b. Comparing with the values of bond strengths given
in Table 1, it is clear
that the hydrogen- and water-assisted desorption energies are significantly
smaller. Nevertheless, the general trend found in the bond strength
is maintained, that is, the acetic acid is the molecule that requires
the least amount of energy to be desorbed, whereas ethyl trihydroxy
silane requires the largest amount of energy to be desorbed. Furthermore,
the trend is maintained regardless of the pH value. It is also important
to point out that the desorption energy of acetic acid reaches and
maintains a value of 0 for μH values above −3.23
eV (below pH = 10) for cementite, whereas for magnetite, it maintains
a value of 0 eV for the range shown in Figure 2b, that is, the desorption of the molecules
does not require energy. This is an important result because it tells
us that the key element governing the desorption energy is the bond
strength, which we have shown to be tunable in principle by exchanging
specific atoms in the molecule, as shown in Figure 2a.

The results presented here allow
us to conclude that the molecules
coating the cementite nanoparticles are more stable, under liquid
conditions, than their counterparts coating the magnetite nanoparticles.
Furthermore, we have found that the ethyl trihydroxy silane molecule
is the most stable one. This conclusion is based on two results: (1)
the bond strength and desorption energies are larger for the cementite
surface than for the magnetite surface and (2) the geometry of the
cementite surface allows the molecules to bind to the surface in a
bidentate and tridentate fashion, whereas the geometry of magnetite
allows the molecules to bind only in a bidentate fashion. These results
were obtained using the (001) surface termination of cementite and
magnetite, which is the most stable surface termination in both cases.
However, this is also true for other surface terminations (see also Supporting Information).

Role of Excess Hydrogen
in the Desorption Process
Until
now, we have shown that molecules bonded to cementite exhibit larger
desorption energies than those of their counterparts adsorbed on magnetite.
Also, we have shown that as the pH decreases, the desorption energy
decreases. Now, we will take a closer look at how the bond strength
is affected by hydrogenation of the adsorbed molecules. We considered
the case where the molecules have been hydrogenated by one hydrogen
atom. We then used an equation analogous to 1, taking into account the extra hydrogen atoms in the initial and
final states, to find the bond strength between the hydrogenated molecules
and each of the two surfaces (cementite and magnetite (001)). These
numbers can be found in Table 2, where we show that the bond strengths of the hydrogenated
molecules are significantly lower than the ones of the nonhydrogenated
molecules; see Table 1. In conclusion, hydrogen atoms weaken the bonds between the molecules
and the magnetic surface.

a Units are in eV.

The results shown above lead us
to the following question: is it
possible that in a slightly acidic environment, say pH = 6 (μH = −2.97), an adsorbed molecule gains hydrogen atoms
over time and then desorbs from the surface hydrogenated by two or
three hydrogens? To answer this question, we assume that the adsorbed
molecules have been hydrogenated by one hydrogen atom, and we calculate
the energy required to detach the hydrogen atom, from the molecule,
and return it to the water reservoir. The results are tabulated in
the third column of Table 2, where we can see that in the case where the molecules are
bonded to the cementite surface the binding energies of the hydrogen
atoms are small, less than 0.74 eV. This means that it is highly unlikely
that the hydrogen molecules stay bonded to the adsorbed molecules
for a long time: If the entire hydrogenated molecule is not desorbed
from the surface quickly, the hydrogen atoms are transferred back
to the water reservoir. However, in the case where the molecules are
adsorbed on the magnetite surface, the binding energies are not negligible,
up to 1.72 eV in the case of boronic acid. This result means that
it is likely to have a hydrogen atom adsorbed on the molecule for
long enough to have the desorption of the molecule assisted by more
than one hydrogen atom, which in turn reduces the desorption energy.
These results give us one more evidence that the coated cementite
nanoparticles exhibit a higher stability than that of the magnetite
counterparts under liquid conditions.

Conclusions
In
this work, we have analyzed the desorption of four molecules
from the cementite and magnetite surfaces under liquid conditions.
The geometry of the cementite structure allows for the tridentate
binding of the molecules on all of the studied surface terminations.
In contrast, there are several surface terminations for the magnetite
structure that do not allow the binding of molecules in a tridentate
fashion. As a result, the desorption energies of molecules found for
the cementite surfaces are higher than the ones found for magnetite.
This allows us to conclude that the coated cementite nanoparticles
exhibit a higher stability than that of the magnetite counterparts
under liquid conditions. Furthermore, our results indicate that ethyl
trihydroxy silane molecules are the best candidate to coat the cementite
nanoparticles because they exhibit the largest desorption energies
under liquid conditions.

The results of the calculations indicate
that the hydrogen atoms
and water molecules play a key role assisting the desorption process.
Although both of them reduce the desorption energy of the adsorbed
molecules, H also weakens the bond strength between the molecules
and the surfaces. Finally, the results indicate that the strength
of the bond, between the adsorbed molecule and the magnetic surface,
depends on the electronegativity of certain atoms in the molecule,
which are not directly involved in the bond. This feature allows for
additional tuning of the desorption energies to get the highest possible
stability.

Computational Details
Quantum mechanical calculations
were performed at the density-functional-theory
(DFT) level using the VASP code.57 We used
projector-augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotentials58 and a plane wave expansion with a kinetic energy cutoff
of 500 eV, while a k-point grid of 4 × 4 ×
1 was used. To avoid interaction between slabs, we used a 20 Å
vacuum between slabs. We have employed generalized gradient approximation
according to Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE).59 We took into account the Hubbard “+U” corrections60 to improve
the description of the Fe3O4 system, using a U–J value of 3.61 eV for Fe d-electrons.
To correctly account for the van der Waals interactions in the system,
we used the vdW-DF exchange-correlation functional.61−64

The typical nanoparticles
of interest have diameters above 10 nm,
where flat facets dominate the surface of the nanoparticle. In cementite
and magnetite, the (001) termination is known to be the most stable.49,65 Therefore, we will use this surface to model the surface of the
nanoparticles. On the other hand, it is important to mention that
test calculations indicate that the bond strength of the molecules
on other surface terminations differs from the ones obtained in the
(001) surface termination by less than 0.3 eV. The cementite and magnetite
slabs contain 32 and 68 atoms, respectively. All atoms in the supercell
were allowed to relax until reaching a force of 0.01 eV/Å.
