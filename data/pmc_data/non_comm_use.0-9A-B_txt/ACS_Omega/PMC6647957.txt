The purpose of this
work was the assembly of multicomponent nano-bioconjugates
based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), proteins (bovine
serum albumin, BSA, or lysozyme, LYZ), and gold nanoparticles (GNPs).
These nano-bioconjugates may find applications in nanomedicine as
theranostic devices. Indeed, MSNs can act as drug carriers, proteins
stabilize MSNs within the bloodstream, or may have therapeutic or
targeting functions. Finally, GNPs can either be used as contrast
agents for imaging or for photothermal therapy. Here, amino-functionalized
MSNs (MSN–NH2) were synthesized and characterized
through various techniques (small angle X-rays scattering TEM, N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, and thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA)). BSA or lysozyme were then grafted on the external surface
of MSN–NH2 to obtain MSN–BSA and MSN–LYZ
bioconjugates, respectively. Protein immobilization on MSNs surface
was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ζ-potential
measurements, and TGA, which also allowed the estimation of protein
loading. The MSN–protein samples were then dispersed in a GNP
solution to obtain MSN–protein–GNPs nano-bioconjugates.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis showed the occurrence
of GNPs on the MSN–protein surface, whereas almost no GNPs
occurred in the protein-free control samples. Fluorescence and Raman
spectroscopies suggested that proteins–GNP interactions involve
tryptophan residues.

1 Introduction
Nanomedicine
is a branch of medicine based on the use of diagnostic
and therapeutic nanodevices.1−3 Nanodevices take advantage of
the specific physicochemical properties of matter at the nanoscale
and thus behave differently from their bulk counterparts.4 There is a wide range of biomedical nanodevices,
and various combinations of them exist. A relevant example is provided
by mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs),5 which are very promising drug delivery systems.6−9 MSNs, besides being highly stable
and biocompatible,10 combine a high external-surface-to-volume
ratio with extended inner surface area and tailored porosity. These
features can be exploited for the immobilization and the controlled
release of drugs11−18 or biological macromolecules.19−22 External surface functionalization plays a key role to promote targeting13 and to enhance the biocompatibility of MSNs.23,24 Indeed, if the external surface of MSNs is functionalized with a
charged biopolymer, as for instance hyaluronic acid, a high degree
of cell internalization, which is likely mediated by a CD44 receptor
in a peculiar kind of cell membranes, can be observed.25,26

Several previous studies focused on the interactions between
mesoporous
silica-based materials and enzymes/proteins.27−29 These bioconjugates
can be engineered for biocatalytic or biomedical applications depending
on the fact that either an enzyme or a therapeutic protein is used.30−32 Micrometric mesoporous silica particles, such as SBA-15 (pore size
6–9 nm), can adsorb proteins/enzymes on the internal surface,33,34 whereas MSNs of the type MCM-41 (pore size ≈ 2 nm) mainly
address protein adsorption on the external surface. Coating by specific
proteins is used to stabilize nanoparticles in body fluids and thus
MSNs can be injected in the bloodstream.35,36 To this purpose, blood plasma proteins, such as serum albumins,
are the most widely used.37,38 Other proteins, such
as antibodies, as well as nucleic acids or simple peptides, are able
to carry out a targeting function,39,40 dragging nanoparticles
to target receptors of cells or organs and, therefore, reducing side
effects and administration doses.41,42 Additionally,
plasma proteins are naturally adsorbed on nanoparticle surfaces forming
a “protein corona”.26,43 This natural
phenomenon affects the surface charge and hence the colloidal stability
of the nanoparticles, which can either be favored or unfavored depending,
for example, on the sign of the electric charge of the externally
grafted biopolymer.26

Gold nanoparticles
(GNPs) are other nanodevices widely exploited
in nanomedicine. GNPs are characterized by a surface plasmon frequency
in the visible range, which makes them suitable for a wide range of
applications, ranging from therapeutic treatments (i.e., photothermal
therapy44) to diagnostic imaging or, more
interestingly, “theranostics”, which is the combination
of therapy and diagnostics.45−47

The purpose of this work
is to combine MSNs, proteins, and GNPs
within a single multicomponent system (Scheme 1). Zhan et al. used mesoporous silica-encapsulated
gold nanorods bioconjugated with antibodies to create a multifunctional
system for imaging of cancer cells.48 Croissant
et al. prepared a pH-responsive drug delivery system constituted by
negatively charged BSA–gold clusters (AuNC@BSA), which interacted
with the positively charged amino-functionalized mesoporous silica
(MSN–NH3+) through electrostatic forces.
At acidic pH, the AuNCs@BSA desorbed from the silica surface, thus
allowing the release of the drug molecules by the pores.10 Here, we use MCM-41-type MSNs due to their ability
to act as potential nanocarriers. MSNs are covalently coated by two
model proteins, namely, bovine serum albumin (BSA) to provide stability
and biocompatibility to the MSNs within the hematic fluid and lysozyme
(LYZ) as a model antimicrobial protein.49,50 In addition,
20 nm nearly spherical GNPs are adsorbed on the protein-conjugated
MSNs. The resulting multicomponent nano-bioconjugates are characterized
by several physicochemical techniques, namely, small angle X-rays
scattering (SAXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electrophoretic
light scattering (ELS), N2-physisorption, thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.
In particular, fluorescence spectroscopy and surface-enhanced Raman
spectroscopy (SERS) allowed to shed light on the mechanism of protein–GNP
interaction. The assembled multicomponent silica–protein–gold
nano-bioconjugate represents a prospective nanodevice for theranostic
applications.

Scheme 1 Assembly of the MSN–Protein–GNP Nano-Bioconjugates
The MSN surface is functionalized
with aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) to obtain MSN–NH2. Proteins (BSA or lysozyme) are grafted, by means of glutaraldehyde,
on the external surface of MSN–NH2 to obtain MSN–protein
bioconjugates. The MSN–protein samples are dispersed in a gold
nanoparticle (GNP) solution to obtain MSN–protein–GNPs
nano-bioconjugates. TEM images show the occurrence of GNPs on the
MSN–protein surface, whereas almost no GNPs occur in the protein-free
control samples.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of MSN–NH2
Amino-functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles
(MSN–NH2) were synthesized as a first step in the
design of multicomponent
nano-bioconjugates. Figure 1 shows the structural and textural characterization of an
MSN–NH2 sample. The TEM image displays the occurrence
of nearly spherical silica particles with a size of about 100–120
nm and with a well-defined porosity consisting of parallel channels
with a hexagonal arrangement of pores (Figure 1A). The SAXS pattern of the MSN–NH2 sample, shown in Figure 1B, displays the typical pattern observed for hexagonal
(P6mm) mesoporous structures, represented
by an intense peak, due to the reflection of 1 0 plane, and two weak
peaks due to the reflection of 1 1 and 2 0 planes, respectively. The
resulting lattice parameter, a, has a value of 46.5
Å. N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm is of a type
IV (Figure 1C), resulting
in a surface area (SBET) of 942 m2/g and a pore volume (Vp) of 1.08
cm3/g. Pore size distribution (Figure 1D) has a maximum at 25.8 Å (Table S1, Supporting Information).

of MSN–NH2 by (A) TEM, (B) SAXS,
(C) N2-physisorption isotherm, and (D) pore size distribution.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
of the MSN–NH2 sample was then carried out. Curves
in Figure 2 show that
MSN–NH2 has
a mass loss at about 100 °C, attributed to the loss of adsorbed
water, and then an additional mass loss above 200 °C (5.7%).
This confirms the occurrence of organic functional groups on the mesoporous
silica surface.

a function
of the temperature of MSN–NH2, MSN–GA, MSN–LYZ,
and MSN–BSA samples.

2.2 Characterization of MSN–NH2–Protein Nano-Bioconjugates
Amino-functionalized
MSNs were conjugated with BSA and lysozyme proteins using glutaraldehyde
as the linker. MSN–protein conjugation was qualitatively assessed
by FTIR spectroscopy and quantitatively by TGA.

Figure S1 (Supporting Information) shows the
FTIR spectra of MSN–BSA and MSN–LYZ conjugates. Both
samples show a peak at 1642 cm–1 due to amide I,
typical of the C=O stretching of peptide bonds.26 Usually, proteins adsorbed on mesoporous silica
show a more intense amide I band and a less intense amide II band.31 Here, the low intensity of amide I and the absence
of the amide II peak are likely due to a low protein loading. This
result is expected. Indeed, MSNs pore diameter (about 2 nm) is smaller
than lysozyme (3.8 nm)51 and BSA (7.2 nm)52 size; thus, adsorption can occur only at the
external surface of MSNs, which is only a small fraction of the whole
surface area.

Figure 2 shows the
mass loss (%) profiles obtained at temperatures above 200 °C,
which can be ascribed to the burning of organics (mass loss % values
obtained at temperatures <200 °C are associated with the loss
of water). Considering the progressive increase in mass loss at the
different steps of bioconjugation, the amount of adsorbed proteins
was calculated to be 55 and 29 mg/g for lysozyme (MSN–LYZ)
and BSA (MSN–BSA), respectively (Table 1). These low loadings are consistent with
FTIR spectra in Figure S1. Table 1 reports TGA and ζ-potential
data also for the glutaraldehyde–MSN conjugate (MSN–GA)
to describe the changes in mass loss and surface charge during the
various steps.

Electrophoretic light scattering
(ELS) technique was used to measure
ζ-potential (ζ) values of MSN-based samples prior to and
after protein immobilization at two different pH values, neutral (pH
= 7) and acidic (pH = 4). The acidic value of pH was chosen to provide
further proof of MSNs surface modification due to the different responses
of MSN–NH2, MSN–BSA, and MSN–LYZ to
pH changes. As expected, we found a highly positive ζ at pH
4 (+31 mV) and an almost neutral value at pH 7 (+2 mV) for MSN–NH2. A similar trend is expected for MSN–LYZ samples due
to the high isoelectric point (IEP ≈ 11) of lysozyme. Finally,
due to IEP (≈4.7) of BSA, we found a sign change for ζ
going from pH 7 (−12 mV) to pH 4 (+18 mV). Hence, ζ values
listed in Table 1 are
consistent with the occurrence of a layer of BSA and LYZ proteins
covering the MSN particle surface.

2.3 TEM Characterization
of MSN–Proteins–GNPs
Nano-Bioconjugates
Results described in the previous paragraph,
particularly, the change of ζ values, demonstrate that BSA and
lysozyme proteins were successfully immobilized on the external MSNs
surface. The occurrence of adsorbed proteins on the surface is particularly
important to achieve the goal of this work, that is, the realization
of nano-bioconjugates constituted by MSN–protein–GNPs.
This was done by dispersing MSN–protein conjugates in a solution
of colloidal gold nanoparticles, as described in Section 2.2. The obtainment of the
nano-bioconjugates was then confirmed by TEM analysis. Figure 3 shows the TEM images of MSN
samples treated with GNPs in the presence of immobilized proteins
on the surface. Representative TEM images of control samples where
protein-free MSN was treated with GNPs are reported in Figure S2.

Figure 3 TEM images of (a–f) MSN–BSA
and (a′–f′)
MSN–LYZ treated with GNPs. Control sample (protein-free) images
are shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information).

In particular, the nanostructures
obtained by mixing a GNP solution
with MSN–BSA and MSN–LYZ are shown in Figure 3a–f and a′–f′,
respectively. Interestingly, in this case, TEM images also allow the
proteins attached to the silica surface to be located, as the presence
of GNPs on the silica surface indirectly indicates the presence of
proteins at the same site.53 It can be
observed that various GNPs, which appear as dark dots, are in contact
with the MSNs surface. On the contrary, protein-free MSN–NH2 samples show only few GNPs at the particle surface (Figure S2, Supporting Information). This indicates
that MSN–NH2 particles have very low reactivity
toward GNPs. It should be noted that many reports provide evidence
that amino-coated silica nanoparticles are able to interact with GNPs,54−58 and indeed, this discrepancy might be due to GNP size effects. Figure 4 compares MSN–NH2 when reacted with small GNPs (5 nm) and larger GNPs (20 nm),
such as those investigated in this work. It appears that smaller GNPs
significantly interact with aminopropyl-coated silica, whereas larger
GNPs have scarce affinity for MSN–NH2 (Figure 4).

Figure 4 TEM images of MSN–NH2 (protein-free) particles
loaded with 5 nm (top) and 20 nm (bottom) GNP.

We recently investigated the formation of the protein corona
on
biopolymer (either hyaluronic acid or chitosan) functionalized MSNs.26 The strategy for its visualization through TEM
was the use of commercial conjugates between the BSA protein and GNPs.
With this method, the black spots in the TEM images corresponded univocally
to the BSA molecules adsorbed on biopolymer-functionalized MSNs surface.
Here, instead, the proteins were previously immobilized on MSNs and
only then GNPs were left to interact with the MSN–protein bioconjugates.
The TEM images clearly suggest that large (20 nm) GNPs can interact
with MSNs only in the presence of surface-bound proteins. The different
reactivities with GNPs observed for MSN–protein conjugates
and MSN–NH2 control samples suggest the involvement
in the interaction of some specific amino acid residues occurring
at the protein surface. This deserves a deeper investigation.

2.4 Spectroscopic Investigation of Protein–GNPs
Interactions in Aqueous Solution
Previous studies have shown
that cysteine, lysine, and tryptophan residues can interact with GNPs.59 Iosin et al. used UV–vis spectroscopy
to verify protein/GNPs interactions60 by
monitoring either the intensity or the position of the localized surface
plasmon resonance band of GNPs at around 420 nm. Winuprasith et al.
used surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to observe the enhancement
of Raman bands of the amino acid residues (likely cysteine, tryptophan,
etc.) involved in the interaction with the GNPs.61 Finally, Vaishanav et al. used fluorescence spectroscopy
to investigate protein/GNPs interactions.62 Based on these studies, we used fluorescence spectroscopy to understand
the interaction between GNPs and LYZ or BSA proteins in aqueous solution.
After an excitation with a 250 nm radiation, the fluorescence spectra
of BSA and lysozyme solutions, at a fixed concentration of 10 mg/mL,
were recorded after addition of increasing volumes of a GNP solution.
The fluorescence spectra, shown in Figure 5, display a peak at the wavelength 340 nm
due to the emission of a tryptophan residue.60 The addition of GNPs results in a quenching of the fluorescence
intensity. This effect may be ascribed to the formation of nonfluorescent
GNPs–protein conjugates (static quenching), thus suggesting
that the tryptophan residues are involved in the interaction with
GNPs.63,64

Figure 5 Fluorescence spectra of (A) BSA/GNPs and (B)
LYZ/GNPs aqueous solutions
with different volume ratios. (C) Raman spectrum of LYZ/GNPs conjugate
solution.

The fluorescence spectra of GNPs–BSA
conjugates undergo
a lower quenching compared to those of GNPs–lysozyme conjugates,
for the same concentration of GNPs. This fact suggests that the GNPs
could display stronger interactions with lysozyme than with BSA. This
different interaction may be due to the structural difference between
the two proteins. Indeed, lysozyme possesses six tryptophan residues,
whereas BSA only two (Figure 6). Moreover, lysozyme is smaller than BSA; thus, the odds
that such residues are sufficiently exposed to establish an interaction
with the GNPs are considerably higher. This different abundances and
availability of tryptophan residues may be the reason why the fluorescence
spectra of GNPs–LYZ conjugates undergo a higher quenching compared
to those of GNPs–BSA conjugates.

Figure 6 Structure of BSA (PDB
file: 3V03)65 and lysozyme
(PDB file: 1LYZ).66 Tryptophan residues are colored in
red. Images obtained with visual molecular dynamics software.

The effect of BSA induced by GNPs
was studied through SERS by Iosin
et al.67 They found that the occurrence
of GNPs modifies the Raman spectrum of BSA, causing an increase in
the intensity of the bands (SERS effect) of tryptophan residues. This
again confirms that tryptophan is significantly involved in the interaction
with GNPs. Figure 5C shows the Raman spectrum of lysozyme solution compared to that
obtained after the addition of GNPs. Similar to what was observed
for BSA,67 also for lysozyme the Raman
signals of tryptophan are enhanced in the presence of GNPs (Figure 5C). Even other signals
turned out to be enhanced, at 1583 and 1616 cm–1, which are, respectively, related to phenylalanine and tyrosine.68 Nevertheless, this fact may likely be due only
to the spatial proximity of the latter residues to some tryptophan
amino acids. Remarkably, findings from different techniques converge
to very similar conclusions.

3 Conclusions
In this work, we have addressed the design of multicomponent nano-bioconjugates
as a mean to expand the range of available nanostructures for possible
biomedical use. In particular, we have shown that mesoporous silica
nanoparticles with a hexagonal structure could be covalently conjugated
to two relevant proteins, such as bovine serum albumin and lysozyme.
The conjugation with BSA and lysozyme, quantified by thermogravimetric
analysis, varies the surface properties as shown by ζ-potential
measurements. Protein conjugation also modifies surface reactivity,
enabling effective interaction with gold nanoparticles. TEM clearly
points out that the bare nanoparticles (MSN–NH2)
poorly interact with large (20 nm) GNPs, as compared to protein-coated
MSNs. TEM images of the MSN–protein–GNP nano-bioconjugates
indicate a more specific interaction promoted by the protein coating.
Indeed, TEM images of GNPs located on the MSNs surface provide indirect
information on protein surface location. The promising results obtained
for these nano-bioconjugates may be related to the tryptophan-mediated
interaction between proteins and GNPs, as demonstrated by fluorescence
and Raman spectroscopies. Further work will be needed to investigate
the application of the obtained nano-bioconjugates in nanomedicine
as biocompatible theranostic devices.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Chemicals
Tetraethylorthosilicate
(98%), 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES, 97%), glutaraldehyde (50%
aqueous solution w/v), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, gold colloid
solutions (GNP, average size 20 and 5 nm), sodium hydroxide (NaOH,
97%), anhydrous toluene (99.8%), methanol (99.8%), acetone (99%),
bovine serum albumin (BSA), and disodium hydrogen phosphate (≥99%)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium dihydrogen phosphate was
purchased from J.T. Baker.

4.2 Preparation of MSN–Protein–GNPs
Nano-Bioconjugates
Aminopropyl-functionalized mesoporous
silica nanoparticles (MSN–NH2) were prepared following
the method reported in ref (69). Then, MSN–protein–GNP nano-bioconjugates
were prepared. Preliminary studies were carried out to find the conditions
that avoid the formation of MSN aggregates. A mass of 20 mg of MSN–NH2 was dispersed in 2 mL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 8 with
the help of an ultrasonic bath. A volume of 8 μL of glutaraldehyde
(GA) was then added, and the mixture obtained was left under mild
rotation (60 rpm) for 45 min. The suspension was centrifuged (4500
rpm for 15 min), and the liquid phase was removed from the solid through
a Pasteur pipette. The remaining solid (MSN–GA) was washed
twice with phosphate buffer solution (0.1 M at pH 8), dispersed under
vigorous stirring and then recovered by centrifugation (4500 rpm for
15 min), and then suspended in the protein solution prepared in phosphate
buffer (0.1 M at pH 8). In the case of lysozyme, 3 mL of a 5 mg/mL
lysozyme solution was used, whereas 1.5 mL of a 10 mg/mL was used
for BSA. The suspension was left under mild rotation (60 rpm) overnight.
After centrifugation (4500 rpm for 15 min), the retrieved solid fraction
was washed twice with phosphate buffer solution (0.1 M at pH 8) and
dried under vacuum. The complete MSN–protein–GNP nano-bioconjugates
were assembled by adding 700 μL of colloidal gold solution to
2 mg of obtained MSN–protein conjugates and leaving the dispersion
under rotation (60 rpm) overnight. Then, the liquid fraction was removed
after centrifugation (4500 rpm for 15 min). The recovered solid was
dried under vacuum and observed by transmission electron microscopy.

4.3 Physicochemical Characterization of MSNs,
MSN–Protein, and MSN–Protein–GNP Samples
The structure of MSN–NH2 was verified by SAXS,
whereas specific surface area and pore size distribution were obtained
by N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77 K recorded
on a Micromeritics ASAP2020 using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda methods,70 respectively. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images were recorded on a Hitachi H-7000 equipped with a thermionic
W filament running at 100 kV. Images were collected by a AMT DVC (2048
× 2048 pixel) CCD camera. Samples for observation were obtained
by direct deposition of the finely ground powders on a carbon-coated
copper grid. Additional investigation was performed on a JEM 1400
Plus TEM microscope. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried
out through a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851. The scans were collected
under oxygen as a reactive gas and nitrogen as a carrier gas in the
range 25–1000 °C. FTIR spectra were obtained through a
Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer equipped with a Platinum-ATR accessory
and a DTGS (deuterated triglycine sulfate) detector. ζ-Potential
(ζ) of MSNs was measured using a Zetasizer Nano ZSP (Malvern
Instruments) in backscatter configuration (θ = 173°), at
a laser wavelength of λ = 633 nm. The scattering cell temperature
was fixed at 25 °C, and the data were analyzed with the Zetasizer
software 7.03 version. The sample was prepared by suspending MSNs
(1 mg/mL) in 0.1 M citrate buffer solution and 0.1 M phosphate buffer
solution to obtain the ζ-potential values at pH 4 and pH 7,
respectively. Samples were sonicated for 30 min and left under stirring
overnight, and then electrophoretic mobility measurements were carried
out. ζ-Potential values were calculated by means of the Henry
equation using water as the dispersant medium (εr = 78.5 and η = 0.89 cP at 25 °C) and f(κa) = 1.5 (Smoluchowski approximation).

4.4 Spectroscopic Characterization of GNP–Protein
Conjugates
GNP–protein conjugates were prepared by
adding to 500 μL of 10 mg/mL protein solution in 0.1 M phosphate
buffer at pH 7 increasing amounts of GNPs solution (50, 100, and 200
μL). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the conjugates with
different GNP–protein ratios thus obtained were recorded by
exciting GNP–protein samples with the emission at 250 nm of
an optical parametric oscillator with a frequency doubler device (Spectra
Physics MOPO), seeded by a pulsed Nd-YAG laser (Spectra Physics Quanta
Ray PRO-270). The excitation pulse energy was of about 1 mJ/pulse,
and pulse-width at half-maximum was 8 ns with 10 Hz repetition rate.
PL measurements were performed in backscattering geometry, focusing
the emitted light signal onto the entrance slit of a monochromator
(ARC Spectra Pro 300i) with a spectral bandwidth of 12 nm. The signal
was detected by a gatable intensified CCD (Princeton Instruments PIMAX).
Raman scattering measurements were carried out in backscattering geometry
with the 632 nm line of a He–Ne laser. Measurements were performed
in air at room temperature with a triple spectrometer Jobin–Yvon
Dilor integrated system with a spectral resolution of about 1 cm–1.
