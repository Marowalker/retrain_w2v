A simple
S–S (disulfide)-bridged dimeric Schiff base probe, L, has been designed, synthesized, and successfully characterized
for the specific recognition of Al3+ and Fe2+ ions as fluorometric and colorimetric “turn-on” responses
in a dimethylformamide (DMF)-H2O solvent mixture, respectively.
The probe L and each metal ion bind through a 1:1 complex
stoichiometry, and the plausible sensing mechanism is proposed based
on the inhibition of the photoinduced electron transfer process (PET).
The reversible chemosensor L showed high sensitivity
toward Al3+ and Fe2+ ions, which was analyzed by fluorescence and
UV–vis spectroscopy techniques up to nanomolar detection limits,
38.26 × 10–9 and 17.54 × 10–9 M, respectively. These experimental details were advocated by density
functional theory (DFT) calculations. The practical utility of the
chemosensor L was further demonstrated in electrochemical
sensing, in vitro antimicrobial activity, molecular logic gate function,
and quantification of the trace amount of Al3+ and Fe2+ ions in real water samples.

Introduction
The rapid advancement
of fluorescent chemosensors for the recognition
of cations has captivated notable attention of researchers because
of their great selectivity, high responsivity, low detection limit,
and naked eye recognition. In addition to their fascinating sensing
toward any type of analyte species, they are still the preferable
techniques utilized in medical, environmental, and biological applications.1−8 Although various scientific methods are available explicitly for
the detection of cations, the colorimetric/fluorescent methods are
observed as better ones.9−12 Besides, the potential of evaluating samples for
different targets using a solitary sensor results in quicker analytical
performance and probable cost reduction.13,14 After oxygen and silicon, the third most abundant metallic element
(by weight 8.3%) in the geosphere of the earth is aluminum.15−18 Additionally, it exists in many animals, natural waters, and plants
as an Al3+ ion. As such, the Al3+ ion is extensively
utilized in different fields, including pharmaceuticals, food packaging,
manufacturing industry, and water cleansing.19−22 As a consequence, it could enter
the human body without much of a stretch through food and water because of the wide usage in different platforms.
The World Health Organization (WHO) outlined that the average day-by-day
intake of aluminum in human body is roughly 3–10 mg and the
bearable admission is assessed to be 7 mg/kg of body weight.23−25 The extreme exposure of human body to Al3+ ions also
causes numerous risky diseases such as the progression of bone disease
in children, encephalopathy, Alzheimer’s disease, Meknes disorder,
and Parkinson’s disease.26−31 Until now, not very many fluorescent chemosensors have been investigated
for selective detection of Al3+ ions.32 The poor coordination ability, strong hydration capacity,
and lack of spectroscopic characteristics of the Al3+ ion have made its screening
and detection difficult.33 Therefore, the
advancement of profoundly selective and sensitive fluorescent Al3+ sensors having turn-on sort of fluorescence changes is of
critical interest for fast and careful discrimination of Al3+ ions from other potentially competing metal ions at a very low concentration
(nanomolar level) in biological and environmental systems.34−41

Similarly, iron is the most imperative bioactive transition
metal
involved in living systems and also the most essential trace element
for human sustenance.42−45 The World Health Organization has reported that every day need of
Fe2+ for a human body is around 10–50 mg/day. In
addition, it plays a critical role in biochemical processes like oxygen
transportation, cellular metabolism, and DNA synthesis and is also
involved in electron transfer.46−49 Accordingly, it is broadly dispersed in environmental
and biological materials.50−53 Be that as it may, Fe2+ ion deficiency
or overconsumption causes various diseases such as low blood pressure,
heart diseases, kidney damages, hemochromatosis, anemia, cellular
damage, atherosclerosis, cancer, and neurological disorders.54,55 In view of the above reasons, the development of a reliable recognition
method for concentration level of Fe2+ ion has consistently
attracted a lot of consideration in environmental and scientific fields
are important yet additionally opportune.56−63

Conventional signaling mechanisms such as photoinduced electron
transfer (PET), CT, ET, and excimer/exciplex, etc. have been evolved/used
for the optical recognition of various analytes based on the principal
photophysical properties of fluorescent chemosensors.64−67 The photoinduced electron transfer (PET) mechanism has been involved
most extensively in fluorescent chemosensors among other conventional
mechanisms.68−71 When photoinduced electron transfer (PET) takes place from lone
pairs of electronegative atoms (N, O, and S) of a sensor molecule
to highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of excited fluorophore,
turn-on fluorescence occurs. This PET process causes the quenching
of fluorophore and reviving via the inhibition of PET by guest species.72−74 In continuation of our work toward developing small-molecule-based
colorimetric/fluorometric chemosensors, we herein report a simple
naphthalene-based Schiff base fluorometric and colorimetric chemosensor
for post-transition (Al3+) and transition (Fe2+) metal ions through the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) mechanism.
To the best of our knowledge, L is the first naphthalene-based
probe having the quality of recognizing both Al3+ and Fe2+ ions via two different detection modes.

Results and Discussion
Synthetic
Design of Probe L
Probe L was obtained
by a simple single-step Schiff base reaction
between cystamine dihydrochloride and 2-hydroxy naphthaldehyde in
methanol with good yield (Scheme 1). The probe L was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR and liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses (Figures S2–S4). For an effective chemosensor, signaling (fluorophore) and ion-binding
(ionophore) units linked with a suitable spacer are highly essential.
In our work, we have chosen naphthalene as a fluorophore because of
its excellent photophysical properties, high fluorescence quantum
yield, better coordination ability, and competitive stability. Disulfide-containing
cystamine dihydrochloride was selected as an ionophore as it is an
important constituent in numerous metalloproteins and bioenzymes that
plays a vital role in their thermal stability and biocatalytic activities.
In this context, our work focus on the development of the typical
naphthalene-based probe L for selective detection of
Al3+ and Fe2+ by dual mode of detection, fluorogenic
and chromogenic, respectively.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Probe L
Colorimetric Recognition of Fe2+
Response of L toward Fe2+ Ions
The
UV–vis absorption spectrum of probe L in
dimethylformamide (DMF)-H2O HEPES (1:1 (v/v), 50 mM, pH
= 7.4) shows two intense bands with λmax at 400 and
422 nm (Figure S5). The selective absorption
response of probe L (2 × 10–5 M)
to Fe2+ was investigated over various metal ions of environmental
and biological significance such as Ag+, Al3+, Ba2+, Bi3+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Ce3+, Co2+, Cr3+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Hg2+, K+, La3+, Li2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Na+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Sr2+, Zn2+, and Zr2+ in DMF-H2O HEPES
(1:1 (v/v), 50 mM, pH = 7.4) solution at λex = 340
nm. During the absorption spectral analysis, a distinguishable change
in the spectra was observed at 418 nm upon addition of Fe2+. Interestingly, other metal ions produced little or no changes in
the absorbance spectra with probe L (Figures 1 and S6). The counter anionic effect of probe L was analyzed
with FeSO4, Fe(C2H3O2)2, and Fe(OH)2 metal salts to discriminate Fe2+ ions (Figure S7). Therefore,
this result proves that probe L could serve as a potential
colorimetric sensor for Fe2+ and the enhancement is due
to the inhibition of the photoinduced electron transfer process (PET).

10–5 M) in DMF-H2O HEPES solution (1:1
v/v, 50 mM, pH = 7.4) in the presence of various metal ions (100 equiv,
λex = 340 nm).

Interference of Other Metal Ions
To understand the
realistic utility of probe L, the dual metal cross tainting
test was executed, as shown in Figure 2. The competition experiments were carried out by monitoring
the changes in the emission intensity before and after adding Fe2+ into the L solution with interferants (100
equiv, DMF-H2O HEPES (1:1 (v/v), 50 mM, pH = 7.4)). L treated with 100 equiv of Fe2+ in the presence
of other metal ions (100 equiv) (Ag+, Al3+,
Ba2+, Bi3+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Ce3+, Co2+, Cr3+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Hg2+, K+, La3+, Li2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Na+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Sr2+, Zn2+, and Zr2+) did not show any substantial spectral changes.
This study reveals that other metal ions did not interfere during
the detection of Fe2+ by probe L, as noticed
from Figure 2.

mixture of dual metal ions (Fe2+ and other stated metal
ions) in DMF-H2O HEPES (1:1 (v/v), 50 mM, pH = 7.4). Error
bars indicate the standard deviation among three samples, and the
average is taken from them.

Effect of pH and Time Response
To study the practical
applicability of probe L as an effective colorimetric
sensor, we examined the effect of pH on response of the absorption spectral bands of
probe L to Fe2+ at different pH values from
1 to 12 (Figures S8 and S9). For this,
the solution was prepared by mixing NaOH and HCl in DMF-H2O (1:1 v/v). The result shows that there is no significant change
in probe L at acidic and basic conditions. However, at
neutral conditions, L + Fe2+ is quite stable
and there is a slight enhancement of absorption above pH 9 and below
pH 4. This clearly uncovers the optimal condition of probe L to behave as a better sensor for the analytes under the physiological
pH of 7.4. Additionally, a study on the effect of time response was
likewise performed to determine the time involved in the binding between probe L and Fe2+ by monitoring the changes in the absorption
spectrum (DMF-H2O HEPES (1:1 (v/v), 50 mM, pH = 7.4)).
The UV–vis absorbance spectra increased, showed the maximum
limit until 2 min, and then remained stable for more than 10 min (Figures S10 and S11). Hence, in a short time,
probe L favorably recognizes Fe2+ ions and
perhaps it can be utilized for sensing of Fe2+ ions in
biological and environmental real sample analysis.

Stoichiometry
and Binding Mode Studies
To understand
the binding mode between probe L and Fe2+,
we carried out UV–vis titrations of probe L by
continuous addition of various concentrations of Fe2+ ions
in DMF-H2O HEPES (1:1 (v/v), 50 mM, pH = 7.4). The free
probe L showed no significant changes in absorbance at
418 nm, but the absorbance gradually enhanced with an increase in
the concentration of Fe2+ ions (0–55 equiv) at 418
nm and got saturated during the addition of 55 equiv of Fe2+ ions (Figure 3).
This result shows that L/Fe2+ has 1:1 binding
stoichiometry. The notable peak at m/z 514.04 for the complex [L + Fe2+] in the
mass spectra further advocates the strong binding between probe L and Fe2+ (Figure S20).

Figure 3 UV–vis absorption spectrum of probe L (2 ×
10–5 M) in DMF-H2O HEPES solution (1:1
v/v, 50 mM, pH = 7.4) with different concentrations (0–55 equiv,
λex = 340 nm) of Fe2+.

To further validate the stoichiometry of L and
Fe2+, the absorbance changes were used as a function of
mole
fraction of Fe2+ in Job’s plot method82 and the maximum absorbance was observed at 0.5,
as shown in Figure 4, which eventually predicts a 1:1 binding stoichiometry between probe L and Fe2+. The detection limit of probe L was determined as 17.54 × 10–9 M
using the formula 3δ/S, where δ denotes
the standard deviation of the blank signal and S denotes
the slope of the linear calibration plot.83 Furthermore, the Benesi–Hildebrand nonlinear curve fitting
method confirms the above binding stoichiometry (Figure 5). The association constant
(Ka) of the L + Fe2+ complex is determined by eq 1(84) 1  where A is the UV–vis
absorbance in the presence of Fe2+ and A0 is the UV–vis absorbance in the absence of Fe2+ at 418 nm, respectively. A′ is the
maximum absorbance of probe L in the presence of excess
amount of Fe2+. Plotting of 1/A – A0 versus 1/[Fe2+] showed a linear
relationship (Figure 5), which also confirms the 1:1 binding stoichiometry of L + Fe2+. The association constant was calculated as Ka = 2.15 × 102 M–1 for the L + Fe2+ complex.

the complexation of the [L +

among three samples, and the average is taken from them.

three samples, and the average is taken from them.

Reversibility of the Probe L
The chemical
reversibility of the molecular recognition process of probe L was performed, which is an important requirement for the
detection of specific analytes (Figure 6). Accordingly, by adding ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA; 100 equiv) to a mixture of the L + Fe2+ complex, the original absorption spectra evolved at 418
nm. Hence, the free probe L can again participate in
another Fe2+ binding process. This reversible response
of probe L with this sort of chelating ability toward
Fe2+ meant that the probe L in buffered solution
is chemically reversible and can be used for selective recognition
of Fe2+ in biological and environmental real samples up
to 10 cycles, as shown in Figures 6b and S12.

of probe L/Fe2+.

Fluorescent Recognition of Al3+
Response of L toward Al3+ Ions
Fluorescence emission highly
depends upon the nature of the solvent
system. In our present work, the maximum fluorescence emission is
observed in DMF as compared to any other solvents including methanol,
ethanol, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, and tetrahydrofuran. The
outcomes showed that probe L could be used to detect
the Al3+ through fluorescent emission in DMF. The λex was fixed at 400 nm for cation binding studies based on
the absorption spectrum of L and showed λem around 453 nm in DMF-H2O HEPES (1:1 (v/v), 50 mM, pH
= 7.4). Afterward, the binding property of probe L with
various cations was analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy upon addition
of several cations such as Ag+, Al3+, Ba2+, Bi3+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Ce3+, Co2+, Cr3+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Hg2+, K+, La3+, Li2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Na+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Sr2+, Zn2+, and Zr2+ in DMF-H2O HEPES (1:1 (v/v),
50 mM, pH = 7.4) solution. The free probe L showed a
weak fluorescence emission at 453 nm. However, upon addition of various
metal ions to the solution of L, there were no prominent
changes in the fluorescence intensity except in the case of Al3+ (Figures 7 and S13). The counter anionic effect
of probe L was studied with AlCl3 and Al2(SO4)3 metal salts to discriminate Al3+ ions (Figure S14). Therefore,
the high fluorescence intensity of probe L during the
addition of Al3+ exhibits a selective recognition over
the other cations by a fluorescence turn-on mechanism.

of probe L (4 × 10–6 M) in the
presence of various cations (100 equiv λex = 400
nm) in DMF-H2O HEPES solution (1:1 v/v, 50 mM,
pH = 7.4).

Interference of Other Cations
To investigate the effect
of interfering cations such as Ag+, Ba2+, Bi3+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Ce3+, Co2+, Cr3+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Hg2+, K+, La3+, Li2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Na+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Sr2+, Zn2+, and
Zr2+, antijamming tests in the presence of Al3+ in DMF-H2O HEPES (1:1 (v/v), 50 mM, pH = 7.4) solution
were performed, as shown in Figure 8. The results show that relatively low interference
or no interference was observed for the recognition of Al3+ in the presence of other potentially competing cations. Therefore,
the L + Al3+ system shows no changes upon addition of other
competitive cations. Thus, probe L can be used for the
specific recognition of Al3+ ions in real-sample sensing
analysis.

Bi3+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Ce3+, Co2+, Cr3+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Hg2+, K+, La3+, Li2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Na+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Sr2+, Zn2+, and Zr2+; 100 equiv, λex = 400 nm)
in DMF-H2O HEPES solution (1:1 v/v, 50 mM, pH = 7.4). Error
bars indicate the standard deviation among three samples, and the
average is taken from them.

Effect of pH and Time Response
To comprehend the practical
applicability of probe L, a correlation study has been
performed between L and L + Al3+ at various pH ranges to fix a particular pH to investigate the photophysical
properties in DMF-H2O (1:1 (v/v)) (Figures S15 and S16). Experimental outcomes demonstrate that
there is a slight quenching of fluorescence intensity in probe L at both high acidic and basic conditions. Conversely, for L + Al3+, at acidic conditions (beneath pH 5),
the fluorescence intensity increases with the decreasing pH values,
and in the pH range of 6–8 pH, it shows very steady enhancement.
Again, it decreases with increasing pH values at basic conditions
(above pH 8). These results demonstrate that probe L shows
good fluorescence response toward Al3+ under the physiological
and neutral pH conditions. Therefore, a pH of 7.4 was fixed as the
ideal working condition throughout the spectroscopic analyses. Besides,
the fluorescence response of probe L to Al3+ in DMF-H2O HEPES (1:1 (v/v), 50 mM, pH = 7.4) versus
time (in minutes) was additionally analyzed (Figures S17 and S18). The fluorescence emission intensity increased
and achieved the maximum level of saturation in 4 min and kept unfaltering
for further 10 min. From this study, plainly the probe L can recognize the Al3+ in a short time frame of 4 min,
which could be of potential value for biological and environmental
Al3+ detection.

Stoichiometry and Binding Mode Studies
To get further
insight into the limit of detection and binding interaction between
Al3+ with L, we performed fluorescence titrations
of the probe L in the solution containing different concentrations
of Al3+ ions (DMF-H2O HEPES (1:1 (v/v), 50 mM,
pH = 7.4)). The fluorescence intensity increased with the increasing
concentration of Al3+ (0–80 equiv) with notable
changes. The probe L showed no obvious changes in fluorescence
emission intensity at 453 nm when it is excited at 400 nm. Stepwise,
progressive additions of Al3+ to probe L showed
a strong emission, increasing the fluorescence enhancement at 453
nm (Figure 9). Furthermore,
the spectral changes arrested when 80 equiv of Al3+ was
added. We proposed that this phenomenon could be ascribed to the formation
of a ligand–metal complex inhibiting the photoinduced electron
transfer (PET) process. The coordination between probe L and Al3+ obstructs the PET mechanism. Nevertheless, it
introduces rigidity and consequently reduces the flexibility in probe L. Along these lines, the complexation of Al3+ with
probe L recovers emission of naphthol and results in
a strong fluorescence emission.

Figure 9 Fluorescence titration spectra of probe L (4 ×
10–6 M) upon incremental addition of Al3+ ions (0–80 equiv, λex = 400 nm) in DMF-H2O HEPES solution (1:1 v/v, 50 mM, pH = 7.4).

The Job plot technique was utilized to find out the stoichiometry
between Al3+ and probe L. The emission intensity
of L + Al3+ at 453 nm was plotted as a function
of its molar fraction under a constant total concentration. The maximum
emission point appeared at a molar fraction of 0.5, which is demonstrative
of the 1:1 complexing stoichiometry between probe L and
Al3+ (Figure 10). The detection limit of probe L was determined
as 38.26 × 10–9 M. Moreover, the complexing
stoichiometry between probe L with Al3+ ion
was also confirmed using the Benesi–Hildebrand nonlinear curve
fitting method. The association constant (Ka) of the L + Al3+ complex is determined by eq 2 as follows84 2  Here, I and I0 are the fluorescence intensities
at 453 nm in the presence
and absence of Al3+, respectively; I′
is the saturated intensity of probe L in the presence
of excess amount of Al3+; and [Al3+] is the
concentration of Al3+ ions added. Plotting of 1/I – I0 versus 1/[Al3+] showed a linear relationship (Figure 11), which also strongly supports the 1:1
complexing stoichiometry of L + Al3+, and
the association constant Ka was calculated
to be 3.81 × 103 M–1.

Al3+ ions in DMF-H2O HEPES solution

is taken from them.

plot of the 1:1 complex of probe L and Al3+ ions. Error bars indicate the standard
deviation among three samples, and the average is taken from them.

The coordination modes of probe L with
Al3+ were further studied by the 1H NMR titration
experiment. Figure 12 shows the spectral
changes in chemical shifts of probe L with and without
Al3+ (0–2 equiv). There is a slight upfield shift
in the “–OH” proton and “C=N”
proton on addition of 1 equiv of Al3+. This clearly indicates
that the O atom of the phenolic −OH group and the N atom of
the C=N (amine) group are coordinated strongly to the Al3+ ion. At this point, on increasing the addition of Al3+, there was no reasonable spectral change, which confirms
the 1:1 binding of L to Al3+.

experiment of probe L and
its complex with Al3+ ions (0–2 equiv).

Reversibility of the Probe L
For a few
useful applications, the recognition and reversibility of the probe L toward Al3+ is a vital necessity. The reversibility
process was inspected during the addition of EDTA (100 equiv) to the
complex mixture of L and Al3+ in DMF-H2O HEPES (1:1 (v/v), 50 mM, pH = 7.4). The fluorescence intensity
at 453 nm disappeared, as shown in Figure 13a. However, addition of Al3+ again
to the mixture of L + Al3+ containing EDTA
attained a considerably enhanced fluorescence intensity. As an outcome, the fluorescence intensity changes were recyclable simply
through the addition of EDTA. These results showed that EDTA could
be a proper chelating reagent, which could completely regenerate the
probe L for further repeated usage toward Al3+ as an off–on–off switch chemosensor. The regenerated
probe L can be used up to 10 cycles, as shown in Figures 13b and S19. The comparative examination of probe L with recently reported sensors is outlined in Table 1.

Based on the above results, the proposed binding
mechanism is illustrated
in Scheme 2. The probe L exhibits weak absorbance and low fluorescence emission as
a result of the intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer process.
Both emission and absorption show strong enhancement upon addition
of Al3+ and Fe2+ ions to the probe L, respectively. The high enhancement may be due to the suppression
of the photoinduced electron transfer process of the probe L and the rigidity of the complex after binding with respective ions.
Job’s plot study, Benesi–Hildebrand nonlinear curve
fitting analysis, and the mass spectra confirm the binding stoichiometry
of [H]/[G] (1:1) of L + Al3+ and L + Fe2+.

Scheme 2 Proposed Binding Mechanism of Probe L with Al3+ and Fe2+ Ions
Microscopic Studies
Furthermore,
to acquire a better
comprehension of the surface topography changes, scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images of L, L + Al3+, and L + Fe2+ were examined, which
are displayed in Figure 14a–c. Before and after complexation, there are differences
in SEM images, showing a crystal-like structure in probe L, which agglomerated upon addition of Al3+ and became
plain and giving plate-like structure due to the complexation of L + Fe2+. The chemical compositions of L + Al3+ and L + Fe2+ were estimated
by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) analysis (Figure 14d,e), which directly indicates
the existence of carbon (C), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S),
aluminum (Al), and Iron (Fe) elements in the synthesized L + Al3+ and L + Fe2+ complexes.

FT-IR Analysis
FT-IR analysis was performed to get
insight into the structure and binding mode of the complexes. In the
FT-IR spectra of probe L, the characteristic absorption
bands at 3002, 1570, and 650 cm–1 are due to the
OH, C=N, and S–S stretching groups, respectively. There
is a notable shift in the absorption bands of probe L on addition of Al3+ ions from 3002, 1570 and 650 to 3010,
1576, and 652 cm–1, respectively. In the IR spectra
of L + Fe2+, stretching bands are shifted
to 3043, 1574, and 652 cm–1 from the bands of free
probe L, respectively. These shifts indicate the possible
binding of Al3+ ions and Fe2+ ions with the
OH and C=N groups of probe L, respectively (Figure 15).

Density functional theory (DFT) Studies
To understand
the structure of L and its complexation with Al3+ and Fe2+, density functional theory and ab initio calculations
at the B3LYP/6-311++G** and HF/6-31G* levels of theory were performed,
respectively. The optimized geometries of L, L + Al3+, and L + Fe2+ complexes
at the B3LYP/6-311++G** level of theory are shown in Figure 16a–c. From Figure 16b, it is observed
that L + Al3+ forms a pentadentate complex,
wherein Al3+ interacts with nitrogen (Al–N(1), Al–N(2)),
oxygen (Al–O(1), Al–O(2)), and sulfur (Al–S(2))
having bond lengths of 1.939, 1.938, 1.942, 1.961, and 2.437 Å,
respectively, as shown in Table 2. Similarly, in the case of L + Fe2+, the structure forms a pentadentate complex, on interacting
with two nitrogen atoms, two oxygen atoms, and one sulfur atom (Figure 16c). On comparing the bond lengths of the L + Fe2+ complex, it was observed that Al–N1,
Al–N2, Al–O1, and Al–O2 bond lengths are shorter,
indicating that Al3+ could have more profound interaction
with the probe L than Fe2+. Overall, the interaction
of Fe2+ and Al3+ has a significant effect on
the geometry of the probe, as observed from Figure 16. The optimized energy of the probe L is −2061.91 hartrees and that of its complexes L + Al3+ and L + Fe2+ are
−2303.56 and −3325.20 hartrees, respectively. The interaction
energies of L + Al3+ and L +
Fe2+ complexes are found to be −33.85 and −19.86
eV, respectively. The results clearly indicate that though Fe2+ forms more covalent bonds with the probe L,
Al3+ seems to have stronger interaction and hence could
be the most suitable metal ion to complex with the probe L.

Figure 17 shows
the FT-IR spectra of L, L + Al3+, and L + Fe2+ structures calculated at the
B3LYP/6-311++G** level of theory. The calculated frequencies at the
HF/6-31G* and B3LYP/6-311++G** levels of theory are listed in Table 3. For receptor L, three distinctive absorption bands are observed at 472,
1711, and 3788 cm–1 frequencies, which correspond
to S–S, C=N, and O–H vibrations, respectively.
Upon interaction of Al3+, the bands undergo significant
reduction in the frequency, thereby showing a shift toward the red
region. Similarly, in the L + Fe2+ complex,
the absorption band is obtained at 498 cm–1 for
the S–S vibration, which is a blue shift from the probe, while
C–N and O–H vibrations are red-shifted. The frequency
calculated at HF/6-31G* for all of the structures matches well with
the B3LYP, as seen from Table 3.

The highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) energies are calculated for the complexes
and depicted in Figure 18. For the receptor L, the HOMO and LUMO energies
are −6.042 and −1.703 eV, respectively, and the calculated
energy gap value is 4.339 eV. Upon complexation of Al3+ and Fe2+ with the probe L, the energy gap
values are found to be 0.101 and 0.100 eV, respectively. Comparatively, L + Al3+ and L + Fe2+ complexes
have an almost smaller energy gap, justifying that they are easily
polarizable and more reactive.85,86

The ionization potential (I) and electron affinity
(A) along with various other chemical reactivity
descriptors for the probe L and its complexes are calculated
and listed in Table 4. The chemical potentials of L, L + Al3+, and L + Fe2+ structures are found
to be −3.873, −0.479, and −0.370 eV, respectively.
A significantly large value for the L + Fe2+ complex clearly indicates that it is more stable and hence does
not decompose spontaneously.87 The global
softness value of the L + Fe2+ complex is
high compared to the L + Al3+ complex, identifying
the former to be more polarized than its counterpart. Other reactivity
descriptors further justify the result, making L + Fe2+ as the more suitable complex than L + Al3+. The graphical representation of Mulliken atomic charges
for the structures is depicted in Figure 19. From the Mulliken data, it is observed
that all of the hydrogen atoms have negative charges and most of the
carbon atoms have positive charges.

The experimental and theoretical 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the probe L are shown in Figure 20. The corresponding
chemical shift values are presented in Table 5. The NMR spectra of the probe L are theoretically calculated by gauge-independent atomic orbitals
(GIAOs) with respect to tetramethylsilane (TMS) at the B3LYP/6-311++G**
level of theory in the gas phase. The aromatic proton peaks in the
benzene rings are usually observed between 7 and 8 ppm.88 In this study, the chemical shifts for the benzene
ring of protons are experimentally observed to be in the range of
7.21–8.08 ppm. The theoretically calculated chemical shift
for the same is found to be between 7.49 and 7.93 ppm and matches
well with our experimental result. Experimentally, the chemical shift
values of H21 and H19 atoms that belong to the methylene group are
3.98 and 3.17 ppm, respectively. The calculated theoretical values
of H21 (3.84) and H19 (2.68) also match with the experimental result.
The chemical shift values of aromatic carbons are usually found to
be overlapped in the range of 150–100 ppm.89 In our case, the chemical shift values of the aromatic
carbon in the benzene ring are found to be in the range of 106.45–137.55
ppm experimentally and 117.74–136.40 ppm theoretically. Both
theoretical and experimental values correlate with the earlier study.89 The chemical shifts of methylene carbon (C25,
C23) are experimentally observed at 38.46 and 50.38 ppm, respectively.
The calculated chemical shift values of C25 and C23 are found to be
54.14 and 49.16 ppm, respectively, and they match well with our experimental
results.

Further time-dependent density
functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations
using the B3LYP/6-311++G** level were performed for L and L + Fe2+ structures to study their UV
absorption characteristics. The simulated absorption spectra of L and L + Fe2+ structures are shown
in Figure 22, and
the calculated results are listed in Table 6. The UV–visible spectra for the probe L exhibit the maximum absorption peak at 320.06 nm in the
UV region (E = 3.874 eV and f =
0.158 au) along with two absorption peaks located at 316.20 and 310.71
nm (E = 3.921 eV, f = 0.088 au and E = 3.990 eV, f = 0.001 au, respectively).
In the case of the L + Fe2+ complex, the strongest
absorption peak is featured at 1639.50 nm (E = 0.756
eV and f = 0.001 au), which is red-shifted from the
corresponding strongest absorption peak of the probe L. Two additional small peaks are identified at 1274.76 and 863.28

Application Studies
Determination of Al3+ & Fe2+ Ions
in Real Water Samples
To demonstrate the practical utility
of probe L, we have estimated the most abundant Al3+ and Fe2+ ions in different water samples to find
the feasibility of probe L via fluorescence and UV–vis
absorption techniques. The samples were carefully filtered using a
0.5 μL membrane and utilized for the sensing studies. Through
atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS analysis), the reading of 0.5–6
ppm was registered for Al3+ and Fe2+ ion concentrations.
Two different commercially available water samples were analyzed by
this method, all within the Port Blair, Andaman, region (Table 7). The spiked samples
were analyzed and confirmed with known standard Al3+ and
Fe2+ ion solutions added to probe L (4 μM).
The result indicates that the probe L could be potentially
utilized for the recognition of the selected metal ions in real water
samples without any interferences of other coexisting metal ions.

Electrochemical Behavior of Probe L with Al3+ and
Fe2+ Ions
Electrochemical sensing execution of
probe L toward Al3+ and Fe2+ ions
has been investigated. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of probe L was estimated in the presence and absence of various cations
such as Al3+, Fe2+, Ni2+, and Hg2+, respectively. Here, probe L exhibited some incredible changes
upon addition of Al3+ metal ions in DMF solution. Also,
electrochemical oxidation of the first peak of probe L was observed, which corresponds to the reversible behavior.90−93 It might be due to the oxidation of the imine group in which the
first oxidation potential observed is −0.96 V. As seen in Figure 23a, probe L alone demonstrated the reduction potential (Erdx) of −0.96 V. Conversely, on addition of Al3+, the oxidation potential of L + Al3+ shifted to −0.62 V. Interestingly, on simultaneous addition
of Al3+ and Fe2+, the peak potential again shifted
to −0.57 V. This notable potential shift (Eox) reveals the bonding attraction between the probe L and Al3+ ions. Figure 23b shows that the addition of Ni2+ and Hg2+ could not cause any shift in the potential of
probe L. Meanwhile, under comparative conditions, probe L on investigation with the previously described cations such
as Fe2+, Ni2+, and Hg2+ did not show
any significant potential shift or changes in the oxidation peak (Figure 23a,b). All of the
above outcomes showed that the probe L is highly sensitive
and selective to Al3+ ions than other aggressive cations.
From these investigations, the overall order of selectivity is Al3+ > Fe2+ > Ni2+ > Hg2+ (Table S1). Finally, the results provide
useful
information about the electrochemical sensing nature of probe L toward Al3+.

probe L through

Fe2+ and (b) various metal ions Ni2+ and Hg2+ (100 equiv) with the 0.1 M TBAP supporting electrolyte in

Antimicrobial Activity
of Probe L with Al3+ and Fe2+ Ions
The in vitro biological screening effects
of the probe L and its complexes L + Al3+ and L + Fe2+ were examined against
potential pathogens including both bacteria and fungi such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia
coli, and Aspergillus flavus by the disc diffusion method. Empty sterile discs added with the
probe L and complexes L + Al3+ and L + Fe2+ were incubated carefully. The
test solution was spread out, and the growth of the inoculated pathogen
was found to be affected during this period. The inhibition zone developed in the plates
was measured (Figure S21). The results
show that both the complexes have moderate activity against bacterial and fungal species (Table 8). L +
Al3+ was found to be more active than probe L and probe L + Fe2+ in the bacterial species S. aureus and E. coli. The results on antifungal activity of probe L + Al3+ show moderate activity in A. flavus, whereas probe L and L + Fe2+ show less activity comparatively.

Molecular Logic Gate Function
A molecular Boolean logic
function94−96 was designed based on the reversible fluorescent
behavior of the probe L in the presence of Al3+/Fe2+ and EDTA (Figure 24). The emission intensity (λmax =
453 nm) and absorbance (λmax = 418 nm) of the probe L were taken as the two outputs of the logic gate function,
which were obtained by the addition of Al3+/Fe2+ and EDTA as the two inputs. In this system, strong fluorescence
or absorption was considered as the ON mode (output = 1), while weak
fluorescence or absorption was considered as the OFF mode (output
= 0). In stage 1, the free probe L was taken as the base
constituent and it showed no obvious change in the emission intensity
and absorbance with the addition of EDTA (input 2) alone as well as
with the addition of equal proportion of Al3+/Fe2+ and EDTA (inputs 1 and 2). However, the fluorescent emission and
absorbance were switched “ON” by the treatment of Al3+/Fe2+ (input 1) alone. Thus, the presence of Al3+/Fe2+ was represented through a NOT gate to realize
the logic function. Since the simultaneous presence of Al3+/Fe2+ and EDTA did not produce any significant change
in the output of probe L, this combination (L + Al3+/Fe2+ + EDTA) was taken as the base
constituents in stage 2. The results obtained in this stage were found
to be identical to those of stage 1. Figure 25b shows the truth table formulated on the
basis of the obtained emission intensity and absorbance changes in
both the above stages. The input–output relationships clearly
show that the molecular interactions of each stage mimic a NOR gate
function (with inverted input 1) outlined in Figure 25a.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed an elegant,
effective, and economic
naphthalene-based probe L as a chemosensor for the detection
of Al3+ and Fe2+ ions by two different spectroscopic
systems. Probe L exhibits selective detection of Al3+ ions by fluorimetry with a detection limit of 38.26 ×
10–9 M and of Fe2+ ions by colorimetry
with a detection limit of 17.54 × 10–9 M. The
recognition of Al3+ and Fe2+ by probe L is free from the interference of Fe2+ and Al3+ ions, respectively, and also from other potentially competing
cations. The probe L can be regenerated from its complexes
with a suitable chelating agent such as EDTA and thus showing its
reversible nature. The potential applications of probe L are demonstrated in real-water sample analysis, electrochemical
sensing, in vitro antimicrobial studies, and molecular logic function.
Therefore, probe L might serve toward the development
of cation-targeting chemosensors in biological, environmental, and
medical monitoring systems. Further tuning of the spacer and fluorophore
toward the novel construction of chemosensors is currently underway
in our laboratory.

Experimental Section
Materials and Instruments
All chemicals and solvents
(of analytical reagent grade and spectroscopic grade) used for synthesis
were purchased from a commercial source (Sigma-Aldrich) and used without
any purification. The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra
of the ligand and complex were recorded on Bruker 400 and 100 MHz
spectrometers (DMSO-d6), respectively,
with tetramethylsilane (SiMe4) as an internal standard.
The chemical shifts (δ) were expressed in ppm. LC-MS was performed
on a LC/MS TOF mass spectrometer. Fourier transform infrared spectrum
was recorded on a Shimadzu IRPrestige-21 spectrophotometer. A Jasco
V-730 spectrophotometer was used for recording UV–vis absorption
spectra at 24 ± 1 °C. JEOL model JSM-6390 was used for examining
scanning electron microscope (SEM) studies. Fluorescence emission
spectral measurements were carried out using a Jasco FP-8200 spectrophotometer
at 24 ± 1 °C. A stock solution of probe L (2
× 10–3 M) was prepared freshly in the system
of DMF–H2O (1:1 (v/v), 50 mM, pH = 7.4, HEPES buffer)
before the experiments for all spectroscopic analyses. The stock solutions
of cations for binding studies were prepared using high-purity chloride
and nitrate salts of different metals of Ag+, Al3+, Ba2+, Bi3+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Ce3+, Co2+, Cr3+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Hg2+, K+, La3+, Li2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Na+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Sr2+, Zn2+, and Zr2+ by dissolving in DMF–H2O HEPES buffer solution (1:1 (v/v), 50 mM, pH = 7.4). The
fluorescence titration of probe L (4 × 10–6 M) was performed with a series of solutions containing various equivalents
of Al3+ ions. The colorimetric titration of probe L (2 × 10–5 M) was carried out with
a series of solutions containing various equivalents of Fe2+ ions. The electrochemical measurements were performed with a glassy
carbon (Alfa Aesar with a purity of 99.99% and with an exposed surface
area of 0.07 cm2) electrode used as a working electrode
and Pt wire as a counter electrode, in which Ag/AgCl with 3.0 M KCl
assisted as the reference electrode.

Synthesis of the Chemosensor (L)
Probe L was obtained by stirring a mixture
of cystamine dihydrochloride
(0.5 g, 4.40 mmol) and 2-hydroxy naphthaldehyde (1.52 g, 8.80 mmol)
in methanol (30 mL). A catalytic amount (5 drops) of TEA was added
dropwise into the above mixture and stirred at 70 °C for 2 h.
The precipitate formed was filtered, washed with methanol thoroughly,
dried at room temperature, and recrystallized in ethanol to give 1-((E)-(2-(2-(2-((E)-(2-hydroxynaphthalen-1-yl)

The geometries of L, L + Al3+, and L + Fe2+ structures
were fully optimized by density functional theory (DFT)
and ab initio using Becke’s three-level parameter Lee–Yang–Parr
(B3LYP)75,76 and Hartree Fock (HF)77 levels along with 6-311++G** and 6-31G* basis sets, respectively.
Vibrational frequency analysis was performed for all of the structures,
confirming them to occupy the local minima. The interaction energies
of all of the complexes were calculated as the difference between
the total energy of the complex and the sum of isolated fragments,
and their results were corrected for the basis set superposition error
(BSSE) by the counterpoise correction method of Boys and Bernardi,
in eq 3, as follows.78 3  where EAB is the
total energy of the complex and EA and EB are the energies of their constituent monomers
or fragments. HOMO–LUMO energies and molecular electrostatic
potential (MEP) analysis were performed at the B3LYP/6-311++G** level
of theory to find the reactive sites of electrophilic and nucleophilic
reactions.79 All of the theoretical calculations
and the molecular representations are done using the Gaussian 09 program
package80 and chemcraft software,81 respectively.

Electrochemical Studies
BioLogic SP-150 potentiostats,
(France) were employed for the electrochemical investigation. All
examinations were completed in an electrochemical cell (10 mL) with
the conventional three-electrode setup at room temperature. In the
electrochemical measurements, the GC electrode used as a working electrode
and Pt wire as a counter electrode, in which Ag/AgCl with 3.0 M KCl
assisted as a reference electrode. Likewise, all of the electrochemical
experiments were done in 2 × 10–5 M probe L
with a 0.1 M nTBAP supporting electrolyte.
In addition, all of the electrochemical studies were carried out in
a N2 atmosphere. The cyclic voltammogram was obtained in
the potential range from −1.5 to 0.5 V at a sweep rate of 0.05
V s–1. Before each estimation, the electrode was
polished with emery paper.

In Vitro Antimicrobial Activity
The antibacterial activities
of probe L and its complexes were performed against the
bacterial species S. aureus and E. coli by the disc diffusion method. The standard
antibacterial agents used in this study were kanamycin and chloramphenicol.
Nutrient agar medium was used for the growth of test organisms in
Petri plates. The compounds were dissolved in DMSO and soaked in Whatman’s
no. 3 filter paper disc of 5 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness. Each
sterile disc was incorporated individually with prepared compounds.
Precautions were taken to prevent the flow of the compounds from the
discs to the outer surface. The prepared compounds were applied in
small quantities on discs, and they were allowed to dry in air. Finally,
they were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, the
diameter of the inhibition zones was measured in mm and recorded.
The antifungal activities of probe L and its complexes
were also checked against A. flavus cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium and also carried out
by the disc diffusion method at 30 °C for 4–15 days. The
agar plates were plunged equally with a swab dipped in the standard
inoculum suspension. To allow any excess surface moisture to be absorbed
into the agar before compound impregnation in discs, the lids were
kept in a laminar flow for 3 min. The test agents were applied to
the surfaces of inoculated plates, and the plates were inverted and
incubated at 30 °C for 4–7 days for fungal growth. Subsequently,
the zone of inhibition was recorded in mm.
