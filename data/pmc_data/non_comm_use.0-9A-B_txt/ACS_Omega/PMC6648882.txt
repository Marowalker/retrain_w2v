The second-order Møller–Plesset
perturbation theory
(MP2) and density functional theory with dispersion function calculations
have been applied to investigate the hydrogen-bonding interaction
between azines and water. The study suggests that the ability of nitrogen
present in azine to act as a hydrogen-bond acceptor decreases in the
order of pyridine (PY) > diazine (DZ)
>
triazine (TZ) > tetrazine (TTZ) >
pentazine
(PZ) > hexazine (HZ). Natural bond orbital
(NBO) analysis, atoms in molecules, symmetry-adapted perturbation
theory (SAPT), and molecular electrostatic potential studies reflect
the factors important for hydrogen-bond strength as well as for the
structural, electronic, and vibrational changes occurring during complexation.
NBO analysis reflects that upon gradual addition of nitrogen atoms,
hyperconjugation leads to an increase in the population of antibonding
O–H bond, thus causing elongation and weakening of O–H
bond in complexes incorporating N···H–OW interaction, whereas rehybridization leads to an increase
in the s character of the carbon hybrid orbital in C–H bond,
thus causing contraction and shortening of C–H bond in complexes
having C–H···OW interactions. From
the topological analysis, an excellent linear correlation is found
to exist between stabilization energy (ΔEBSSE), electron density (ρc), and its Laplacian
(∇2ρc) at the bond critical points.

1 Introduction
Hydrogen-bonding interactions govern the pivotal role in monitoring
the structural characteristics and function of biological molecules.1,2 These hydrogen-bonding interactions are essential in protein folding,
nucleobase stacking, DNA base-pairing, and enzyme catalysis.3−7 Both conventional as well as unconventional hydrogen bonds (HBs)
are important in determining the structure and reactivity of biological
molecules. The conventional HB is defined as X–H···Y,
where hydrogen atom lies between two electronegative elements, such
as O, N, and F, whereas HBs are characterized as unconventional when
C–H group is involved as an HB donor.8 Strong conventional interaction of type N···H–O
plays a significant role in controlling the conformation of small
molecules, whereas unconventional C–H···O interactions
play a dominant role in the stability of protein–protein interfaces,
protein–ligand complexes, protein–nucleic acid interactions,
and DNA–drug complexes.9−14

Among several biological active compounds, azines serve as
a key
building block for proteins, nucleotides, and polymers that play a
pivotal role in biological and material science application. Hydrogen
bonding involved in these species has reaped much more potential in
medicinal chemistry,15−22 and recently, several theoretical studies have been performed to
analyze the effect of successive addition of nitrogen atoms in the
biologically active heterocyclic aromatic moieties.23−25 Azines are
interesting model systems for investigating how successive replacement
of C–H group with nitrogen atom affects the hydrogen-bonding
ability of a 6-membered aromatic ring. Pyridine is found to have a
large number of biological activities, including antiviral, anticancer,
antimicrobial, antidiabetic, antitubercular, antidote, antileishmanial,
antioxidant, antichagasic, antithrombin, anticoagulant, etc. along
with most of the traditional biological activities.26−29 Pyridazine (diazine 1,2) forms
the skeleton of many drugs that are commercially available. Apresoline
drug that contains pyridazine derivative treats hypertension in pregnant
women. Azaphen is another pyridazine-based tricyclic antidepressant
drug having sedative effects.30−34 Pyrimidine (diazine 1,3) bases thymine, cytosine, and uracil subsume
a pyrimidine pentagon ring fusion and are the most important building
blocks of DNA and RNA.35 Folic acid, thiamine,
and riboflavin are some vitamins that contain the pyrimidine ring.36−40 Triazine and tetrazine are highly electron-deficient aromatic systems
due to abundance of electronegative nitrogen atoms. This property
makes them sensitive toward various nucleophiles. The abundance of
nitrogen atoms gives an advantage to use them in coordination chemistry.
This property enables them to be used as templates for preparation
of nanosize frameworks. Their derivatives are not only used for the
treatment of a wide range of diseases but also for many more purposes,
like in originating bactericides and fungicides, in oil fields as
preservatives, disinfectants, industrial deodorants, etc.41 Tetrazine-containing amino acids show tremendous
stability in biological mediums and acidic solutions, which is one
of the important criteria for cancer cell labeling and peptide modification.42

Hydrogen-bonding interactions involving
hydrogen atoms positioned
on azine ring are of particular interest because of the electron-withdrawing
properties of azine. The hydrogens closely attached with aromatic
azine rings are generally more electropositive than those attached
with aliphatic azines, which leads to the formation of stronger H
bonds. It is believed that aromatic units offer exclusive characteristics,
which makes them differ from aliphatic interactions and thus can lead
to specificity of structure and function.

A unified picture
of azines interacting with water is presented
in this manuscript. When azines interact with the hydrogen of water
through nitrogen (N···H–O), a strong HB is formed,
whereas C–H of azine donating HB to the oxygen of water (C–H···O)
is considered to be a very weak interaction. The main purpose of conducting
these studies is to gain insight into the strengths of these HBs as
they relate to biologically relevant structures, especially protein–ligand
complexes. The energetic, topological, electronic, and structural
factors affecting the stability of hydrogen-bonded complexes of azine
with water have been systematically analyzed.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Stability and Structural
Parameters
Pyridine (PY), diazine (DZ), triazine (TZ), tetrazine (TTZ), pentazine
(PZ), and hexazine (HZ) have been optimized
at wB97XD/aug-cc-pVDZ
(L1) and MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ (L2) theoretical levels. As can be seen from Figure 1, DZ12, DZ13, and DZ14 are isomeric forms of DZ with 1,2; 1,3; and 1,4 positioning of two N atoms, respectively.
Similarly TZ123, TZ124, and TZ135 are isomeric forms of TZ and TTZ1234, TTZ1245, and TTZ1235 are isomeric forms of TTZ. The relative energy order of isomeric forms of DZ, TZ, and TTZ is as follows: DZ12 < DZ14 < DZ13, TZ123 < TZ124 < TZ135, and TTZ1234 < TTZ1245 < TTZ1235. It is observed that DZ12, TZ123, and TTZ1234 are the least stable among their isomeric forms and
have nitrogens adjacent to each other, which is in accordance with
the anticipation. The hydrogen bonding of a single water molecule
with these azines in the isolated state leads to stabilization energies
that fall in the range −1.80 to −6.86 kcal/mol at L2
theoretical level whereas the range at L1 level falls from −1.24
to −6.62 kcal/mol. The optimized geometrical parameters for
the complexes using L1 and L2 theoretical levels are summarized in Tables S5–S19. These hydrogen-bonded systems
have been categorized on the basis of HB donor and acceptor groups
in the complex form.

Figure 1 Optimized geometries of azines along with their isomeric
forms
at MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level.

In type WI complexes (shown in Figure 2), the pyridinic nitrogen atom
of azine is
situated with its lone pair facing directly toward the hydrogen atom
of water. These complexes involve single HB formation with N···H–OW interaction. The order of stabilization energies in these
complexes is as follows: PY > TZ123 > TTZ1234 ∼ TTZ1235 > PZ > HZ, which shows that the tendency of pyridinic
nitrogen atom
of azine to act as a HB acceptor decreases with increase in the aza
substitution. As displayed by structural parameters, the strength
of N···H–OW HB reduces with increase
in the number of nitrogen atoms in the ring. The N···H–OW HB angles in these complexes span the range 170–178°,
which suggests the directionality of HB that provides a major contribution
to the stability of complexes.

Figure 2 Optimized geometries of 1:1 hydrogen-bonded
complexes of azines
with water at MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level (type WI and WII).

In type WII complexes (shown in Figure 2), water acts as a HB acceptor toward C–H
of heterocyclic ring and HB donor toward N of the ring, resulting
in a pseudo 5-membered ring. In these complexes, N···H–OW has the major contributing interaction in ΔEBSSE in comparison with C–H···OW, as proposed by geometrical parameters. The stabilization
energies in these complexes authenticate the fact that the HB acceptor
ability of the ring N atom decreases as the aza substitution increases.
Complexes in which the basic center is directly bonded to the nitrogen
atom, such as DZ12-WII, TZ123-WII, and TTZ1234-WII, have
high stabilization energies in comparison with complexes in which
the basic center is not directly bonded to the nitrogen atom, such
as DZ13-WII, DZ14-WII, and TZ135-WII. The N···H–OW HB angle in WII complexes is found to lie in
the range of 124–156°. The deviation from 180° suggests
the role of secondary C–H···OW interaction
present in the complexes.43 The HB angles
are quite linear in type WI complexes that are stabilized
by a single HB, whereas the existence of a second HB in type WII complexes leads to formation of a pseudo 5-membered ring
structure along with a heterocyclic ring, forcing the HB angle to
be deviated from linearity. The type WII complexes are
found to be 0.52–1.73 kcal/mol more stabilized in relation
to their respective type WI complexes.

In type WIII complexes (shown in Figure S1), both lone pairs present in the oxygen of water
act as a HB acceptor toward two C–H bonds of azines. These
complexes involve the formation of a bifurcated structure with water
bonding to two C–H hydrogens. The order of stabilization energy
in these complexes is as follows: TTZ1234 > TZ123 > TZ124 > DZ12 > DZ13 > DZ14 > PY, which indicates
the fact that C–H
HB donor ability decreases as the aza substitution decreases. The
values of C–H···OW HB angle in these
complexes lie in the range of 115–122°, which is in agreement
with the IUPAC definition according to which the X–H···Y
angle should be greater than 110° for an interaction to be characterized
as a HB.

In type WIV complexes (shown in Figure S1), the oxygen of water acts as a HB
acceptor toward
C–H bond of azine. These complexes involve single HB formation
with C–H···OW interaction. The stabilization
energy for these complexes depends on the number of N atoms and position
of C–H bond relative to the nitrogen atom. The order of stabilization
energy in these complexes is: TZ123 > TZ124 > DZ12 > DZ13 > DZ14 > PY, which shows that C–H HB donor ability
increases
with increase in the aza substitution. The C–H···OW HB angles in these complexes lie in the range of 178–180°.
The WIV complexes of DZ12 and TZ123 have higher ΔEBSSE in which the
C–H bond involved in HB interaction is meta and para to the
nitrogen atom, whereas WIV complexes of DZ14 and TZ124 have lower ΔEBSSE values in which the C–H bond involved in HB interaction
is ortho to the nitrogen atom, which clearly shows that C–H
bond meta or para to a nitrogen atom forms a more stable complex relative
to C–H bond ortho to a nitrogen atom. The WIV complexes
are 0.02–0.30 kcal/mol less stable in comparison to their respective WIII complexes.

2.2 Vibrational Properties
of a Hydrogen-Bond
Donor
Table 1 displays the change in HB donor (Δd in Å)
and shifts of stretching frequencies (Δν in cm–1) of the HB donor group upon complex formation relative to monomers.
Upon complex formation, O–H of water as a HB donor in a conventional
N···H–OW HB is usually red-shifted
due to which O–H frequency decreases and there is lengthening
of the O–H bond whereas in contrast to unconventional C–H···OW HB, C–H as a HB donor usually is blue-shifted due
to which the frequency of C–H bond increases and there is shortening
of C–H bond. In type WI complexes involving single
N···H–OW interaction, the order of
Δν for O–H bond is as follows: PY > TZ > TTZ > PZ > HZ,
which elucidates the fact that Δν decreases as aza substitution
increases in the ring. This can be understood in terms of electron
density transfer, i.e., nN → σ*O–H orbital interaction. Upon continuous addition of
nitrogen atoms, there is a regular decrease in the electron density
shift from the nitrogen atom of azine to σ* orbital of O–H
bond of water, which leads to a decrease in the red shift of O–HW bond. The order of Δν correlates well with the
change in O–H bond length and hydrogen-bond distance formed
in these complexes. The shorter the N···H–OW HB distance (r), larger will be the change
in the HB donor length WO–H (Δd) and higher will be the stretching frequency shift (Δν).
Furthermore, stabilization energy of these complexes also corroborates
with the shift in stretching frequency. The Δd and Δν values for red-shifted O–H bond are relatively
higher in complexes involving single N···H–OW interaction in comparison with complexes in which the second
HB is also associated with the former complexes, as reflected from
the comparison of type WI (N···H–OW) and type WII (C–H···OW and N···H–OW) complexes.
The Δd and Δν for blue-shifted
stretches are small in magnitude in a bifurcated structure with two
C–H···OW interactions but a similar
variation is larger in complexes involving single C–H···OW interaction, which is evident from the comparison of type WIII and WIV complexes.

2.3 Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) Analysis
NBO is an excellent
tool for investigation of second-order delocalization
energies. The results of NBO analysis (Table S2) show that lone pair electrons on a pyridinic nitrogen atom are
shifted to σ* antibonding orbital of HB donor WO–H
in type WI and WII complexes under study
except DZ14-WII, TZ123-WI, and TZ123-WII. In the latter
complexes, lone pair of electrons are transferred from pyridinic nitrogen
atom to hydrogen atom. The decrement in E(2) values for nN → σ*O–H orbital interactions with inclusion of nitrogen
atoms in the ring, as seen in type WI and WII complexes, displays that continuous augmentation of nitrogen atoms
in the ring reduces the population of electron density shift from
lone pair on pyridinic nitrogen (N) to the σ* antibonding O–H
orbital of water and is also in consonance with a decrease in red
shift of O–H stretching vibration upon gradual addition of
nitrogen atoms in the ring. Rehybridization enhances the s character
of carbon hybrid orbital of C–H bond with continuous incorporation
of nitrogen atoms in the ring, as seen in type WIII and WIV complexes, which leads to shortening and contraction of
C–H···OW HB. The nN → σ*O–H orbital interaction
in type WII complexes has E(2) values lower in comparison with similar orbital interactions in
type WI. It is worth noticing that the E(2) values for two nO →
σ*C–H orbital interactions are lesser to a
large extent in complexes of type WIII in comparison
with their counterpart complexes of type WIV, which possess
single nO → σ*C–H orbital interactions. Section S1 provides
an analysis for charge transfer and atomic charges on atoms involved
in HB formation.

2.4 Topological Analysis
Atoms in molecules
(AIM) provide an elegant approach to study the concept of hydrogen-bonding
interactions.

The hydrogen-bonded molecular geometries of azine–water
complexes at MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ have been employed to calculate the topological
properties; see Section S2 for description
of topological parameters. The AIM molecular graphs of the complexes
are displayed in Figure 3 where small red balls indicate bond critical points and yellow balls
indicate ring critical points. As seen in Table S3, all HBs in complexes under study satisfy Koch and Popelier’s
criteria with ρc and ∇2ρc of (3, −1) values well within the respective ranges
0.005–0.029 au and 0.028–0.102 au. The ρc and ∇2ρc values of WI and WII complexes follow the order PY > DZ > TZ > TTZ > PZ > HZ, which supports the fact that the tendency
of the pyridinic
nitrogen atom of azine to play the role of an HB acceptor decreases
with increase in the aza substitution. The order of ρc and ∇2ρc of (3, −1) values
in WIII and WIV complexes follow the order TTZ > TZ > DZ > PY,
which authenticates the fact that C–H HB donor ability decreases
as the aza substitution decreases. A good correlation is found to
exist between ρc and ΔEBSSE values for complexes under study (Figure S3). Also, there exists a linear relationship between
∇2ρc and ΔEBSSE values (Figure S4).

graphs of complexes of azines with water at MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ
level (type WI and WII). Small red balls
indicate bond critical points, and small yellow balls indicate ring
critical points.

2.5 Analysis
of Molecular Electrostatic Potential
(MEP) and Proton Affinity (PA)
The study of molecular electrostatic
potential (MEP) is a useful descriptor for predicting the reactivity
of each of the unique nitrogen atoms in the azines. It provides important
information about the HB interaction, which is largely an electrostatic
phenomenon. Figure 4 depicts the contour maps of MEP of azines displaying the electrostatic
potential values of ring nitrogens; red and blue regions indicate
positive and negative MEP sites, respectively. The proton affinity
(PA) of a molecule can easily be related to nucleophilicity of the
basic site, and it provides useful information about the basicity
and reactivity of different nitrogens present in the azines. The PA
values of different nitrogen atoms in the azines are shown in Table 2. Both MEP and PA
values reflect that the basicity of azine reduces with progressive
addition of nitrogen atoms in the ring and with increasing distance
between two nitrogen atoms. For instance, the inclusion of a second
nitrogen atom within the aromatic ring implies the reduction in the
proton affinity values by 3.8, 11.3, and 12.6 kcal/mol and MEP values
by 1.91, 9.95, and 12.66 kcal/mol for ortho (DZ12), meta
(DZ13), and para (DZ14) substitution, respectively,
with respect to PY. It is observed that DZ12 is the most basic among diazines and likewise TZ123 and TTZ1234 are the most basic among triazines and
tetrazines, respectively.

The most negative potential with the notation Vmin is used to diagnose the electron-rich site
of the
molecule, whereas the most positive potential denoted by Vmax is used to recognize the electron-deficient site of
the molecule (Table S1). The electronic
changes occurring during the HB formation can be clearly understood
by comparing Vmin values of isolated azines
with Vmin values of azines in the complex
(designated as V′min). Hence, electronic
reorganization during the HB formation can be gauged as ΔVmin = V′min – Vmin and these MEP parameters
are summarized in Table S2; see Section S3 for a detailed analysis.

2.6 Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT)
SAPT has
been carried out to decompose the stabilization energy
into contributing factors. This method is employed to partition the
stabilization energy into physically meaningful components, like electrostatic
(Eels), induced (Eind), dispersion (Edisp), exchange
(Eexch) interactions, etc. The Eels, Eind, and Edisp components are attractive energy terms
stabilizing the complexes, whereas Eexch component is repulsive. The term δEint,rHF is calculated as the difference between the Hartree–Fock
interaction energy and the sum of all SAPT energy terms (up to the
second order) that do not include any correlation effects. The SAPT
components for the complexes of azines with water in MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ
basis set are reported in Table S4. Generally,
all energy terms increase with sequential addition of nitrogen atoms
in the azine ring. A larger role of the induction term in comparison
with the dispersion term is found in red-shifted hydrogen-bonded complexes
of type WI and WII, whereas the opposite
picture has been seen in blue-shifted hydrogen-bonded type WIII and WIV complexes. The percentage stability due to
electrostatic component is higher in complexes involving single C–H···OW interaction (65.12–66.36%) relative to that in complexes
involving single N···H–OW interaction
(56.27–57.17%). The percentage contribution of the Eind (22.79–23.73%) and Edisp (19.38–20.13%) components in complexes involving
single N···H–OW interaction suggests
the relatively higher contribution of the Eind term over the Edisp term, whereas the
percentage contribution of the Eind (15.37–16.68%)
and Edisp (17.58–18.72%) components
in complexes involving single C–H···OW interaction is nearly the same.

3 Conclusions
We have performed MP2 and wB97XD calculations at aug-cc-pVDZ level
to study the hydrogen-bonding interaction between water and aromatic
heterocyclic azines. The results of stabilization energies, vibrational
frequencies, NBO, MEP, and SAPT calculations support the following
statements.

1. The HB acceptor ability of the pyridinic
nitrogen atom of azine is found to be decreased in the order PY > DZ > TZ > TTZ > PZ > HZ during complexation with
water. Infact,
the inclusion of the subsequent addition of nitrogen atoms in the
ring is accompanied by an inductive effect due to N–N lone
pair interactions, which reduces the tendency of binding a proton.
Thus, the basicity of a pyridinic nitrogen atom of azine reduces as
we move from PY to HZ, which is also in
consonance with proton affinity values. Further, the complexes in
which the basic center is directly bonded to a nitrogen atom, such
as DZ12-WII, TZ123-WII, and TTZ1234-WII, reveal strong hydrogen-bonded
interaction in comparison with complexes in which the basic center
is not directly bonded to a nitrogen atom, such as DZ13-WII, DZ14-WII, and TZ135-WII, which will be manifested again when
considering proton affinity values.

2. The HB donor ability of the C–H
bond of azine is found to be increased in the order PY < DZ < TZ < TTZ.
Indeed, the successive aza substitution makes the C–H bond
of azine more acidic and thus the HB donor ability of the C–H
bond gets increased on moving from PY to TTZ. Moreover, it is observed that the C–H bond of azine acts
as a better HB donor when it is at the meta or para position to aza
nitrogen relative to the ortho-positioned nitrogen atom.

3. Continuous increments in the red-shift
values of O–HW bond and decrement in the blue-shift
values of C–Hazine bond are observed on moving from PY to TTZ, which can be explained on the basis
of hyperconjugative O–H bond lengthening and rehybridization-promoted
C–H bond shortening, respectively.



4 Computational Methods
Ab initio calculations are carried
out through Gaussian 09 software.44 Geometry
optimization of azines and their corresponding
complexes with water are performed at the second-order Møller–Plesset
perturbation (MP2) level in combination with aug-cc-pVDZ basis set.
For comparison purpose, density functional theory with dispersion
calculations at the wB97XD level was also applied in conjuction with
the aug-cc-pVDZ set. Stabilization energy (ΔEBSSE) is predicted as equal to the difference in energy
between each complex and sum of isolated monomers employing the counterpoise
(CP) method of Boys and Bernardi.45 NBO
analysis was performed at wB97XD/aug-cc-pVDZ to analyze the atomic
charges, charge transfer, and E(2) values
within Gaussian 09 package.46 AIM analysis
in molecules using the AIM2000 suite of program is employed to determine
the topological and energetical properties at BCPs and RCPs.47 The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP)
was calculated using the WFA surface analysis suite.48,49 SAPT calculations for the HB complexes under study are calculated
by the use of GAMESS package linked to the SAPT 2012.2 code, to decompose
the total stabilization energy into four fundamental components, namely,
electrostatic, induction, dispersion, and exchange energies.50−52
