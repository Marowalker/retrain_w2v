In this work, using two isotactic
polypropylene (iPP) resins with
similar average isotacticity and molecular weight but different uniformities
of stereo-defect distribution, the β-nucleated iPP/graphene
oxide (β-iPP/GO) composites (NPP-A and NPP-B) were prepared
to investigate the effect of stereo-defect distribution on the nonisothermal
crystallization kinetics and polymorphic melting behavior of the composites
by means of scanning electron microscopy, wide-angle X-ray diffraction,
and differential scanning calorimetry. The results showed that more
uniform stereo-defect distribution led to a slight increase of the
crystallization rate and decrease of the crystallization activation
energy Ec. NPP-B with more uniform stereo-defect
was more favorable for the formation of a large amount of β-phase.
Moreover, the role of the cooling rate was also discussed and it was
found that the higher the cooling rate, the higher the β-phase
content and the smaller the crystalline sizes, meanwhile, the higher
the amount of β-phase with relatively lower thermal stability
that will take part in β–α recrystallization during
the subsequent melting process. For β-iPP/GO composites, although
the cooling rate greatly influences the polymorphic behavior and crystalline
structures of the composites, the uniformity of stereo-defect distribution
was found to be the first factor determining the formation of the
β-phase.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Since the first time, in 1954, polypropylene (PP) was synthesized
by Natta et al. in the laboratory and industrialized in 1957,1,2 PP has been widely used for its excellent thermal and mechanical
properties.3,4 With the development of catalyst technology,
the improvement of catalyst activity and selectivity and the improvement
of catalyst morphology have greatly simplified the production process
of PP and greatly reduced the production cost, which has promoted
the rapid development of the PP industry.5 In just 60 years, PP has become one of the fastest growing, most
productive, and most diverse types of plastics.6 It is widely used as pipes, packaging materials, and separator
materials.6−9

The good properties of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) materials
are directly related to their crystal form. Isotactic PP (iPP) is
a typical polymorphic polymer with different crystal forms including
α-,10,11 β-,12−15 and γ-phase,10,16 exhibiting great differences in properties.17−20 Among these crystal forms, the
α-phase is the most stable and commonly seen modification and
can be obtained under practical processing conditions,21,22 whereas the β-phase is a thermodynamically metastable crystalline
form, whose toughness is higher than the α-phase and can only
be formed through particular methods, such as crystallization in the
melt shear field,23,24 in a temperature gradient field,25 or in the presence of β-nucleating agents
(β-NA).26−28 In these methods, adding β-NA is the most efficient
and simplest way to acquire high content of β-form. After the
addition of a small amount of β-NA, the impact strength of β-iPP
is improved evidently compared with α-iPP.15 However, the rigidity and yield strength are reduced. Some
scholars have found that the growth of α- and β-crystals
has a competitive relationship. The growth of β-crystals needs
to be in a specific temperature range.29 At this time, the growth rate of β-crystals is higher than
that of α-crystals and β-crystals can be formed. When
the temperature exceeds the critical temperature, the growth rate
of the α-crystal is higher than that of the β-crystal
and only the α-crystal can be formed. In addition, the β-crystal
is in a thermodynamic metastable state and its thermal stability is
not as good as that of the α-crystal. The β–α
phase transition might occur during the heating process.3,30 To enhance the stiffness of β-iPP, the composite modification
of iPP using a reinforcing filler may be a possible way to balance
the rigidity and toughness.

In 2004, Andre Geim et al. first
produced graphene by the adhesive
method. Graphene, as a two-dimensional atomic crystal composed of
a single atomic layer of carbon atoms connected by sp2 hybridization,
is only 0.34 nm thick which is the thinnest known material. This special
structure gives graphene many excellent properties, such as outstanding
electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, high elastic modulus,
larger specific surface area, and fractional quantum hall effect.31−34 However, the strong van der Waals force of graphene results in the
characteristics of hydrophobicity and easy agglomeration, and the
application of graphene is greatly limited. Graphene oxide (GO), as
a precursor of graphene, has a structure similar to graphene and can
be used as the preferred choice for reinforcing polymers, benefiting
from its carboxyl groups and carbonyl groups at the edge and hydroxyl
groups and epoxides groups on the matrix.35−37 The existence
of these functional groups improves the hydrophilicity of GO and can
react with polar polymers such as polyamide, poly(vinyl alcohol),
and poly(methyl methacrylate). For nonpolar polymers, functional groups
are introduced to modify the surface of GO. Surface-functionalized
GO has good interfacial compatibility in nonpolar polymers such as
iPP and polystyrene.13,14 Composite modification of iPP
with GO is an important way to make high performance iPP materials.
To make β-iPP gain high toughness and high strength at the same
time, it has always been the key and difficult point to manufacture
iPP/GO composite materials with a high content of β-crystals.
However, GO has a strong effect of α-nucleation in this composite
system, which is not conducive to the formation of β-crystals.13,14

The chain tacticity parameters of iPP are important factors
affecting
the crystallization behavior, including the stereo-defect distribution
and the average isotacticity caused by multiple active sites on heterogeneous
Ziegler–Natta catalysts.38,39 The uniformity of stereo-defect
distribution greatly affects its properties and crystallization, especially
the selectivity of α- and β-crystals. Since it is important
to study the relationship between the crystallization behavior and
the molecular tacticity of iPP, many researchers have studied the
relationship between crystallization behavior, average isotacticity,
and the final mechanical behavior in the past few decades. However,
due to the complexity of Ziegler–Natta polymerization, it is
not easy to adjust the polymerization conditions and to obtain ZN-iPP
with similar average isotacticities and molecular masses but different
stereo-defect distributions. Therefore, the role of stereo-defect
distribution on the crystallization and mechanical properties is still
not clear, as far as we know.

Recently, by using two kinds of
Ziegler–Natta catalysts
with different catalytic activities in the polymerization process,
we synthesized two kinds of iPP samples with different stereo-defect
distributions. Their polymorphic composition, crystallization behavior,
and mechanical properties were studied in previous studies. It was
found that the mechanical properties and β-phase crystallization
of β-iPP are closely related to the uniformity of stereo-defect
distribution.

The aim of this study is to further investigate
the crystallization
process of the β-iPP/GO composites, the nonisothermal crystallization
kinetics of β-iPP/GO composites with different distributions
of stereo-defects were compared by cooling at different rates. From
the application point of view, the nonisothermal crystallization process
is close to the actual operating conditions, so the study of nonisothermal
crystallization kinetics also has practical significance.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
The
iPP resins (PP-A and
PP-B) used in this study were obtained using two kinds of Ziegler–Natta
catalysts (ZN-A and ZN-B, the activity of ZN-A was higher than that
of ZN-B) in the polymerization process, keeping other polymerization
conditions unchanged as described in our previous works.40,41 A brief introduction of their microstructures is provided in Table 1. As can be seen from Table 1, the weighted average
molecular weight Mw and the average isotacticities
of samples are nearly the same, suggesting that the total defects
of PP-A and PP-B are similar. However, compared with PP-B, PP-A has
a more high-isotacticity component (“mm”) and a less
relatively medium and low-isotacticity component (“mr”
and “rr”), indicating that the distribution of stereo-defects
of PP-B is more uniform.

d Samples were extracted in n-heptane
for 24 h at desired temperatures and then the

fraction.

Other raw materials
are obtained through direct purchase. Guangdong
Winner Functional Material Co., Ltd. (China) provided β-NA named
WBG-II, which is composed of heterocyclic double metal (lanthanum
and calcium) complexes; Chengdu Changzheng Chemical Glass Apparatus
Co., Ltd. (China) provided octadecylamine (ODA), ethanol, and xylene;
Guangzhou Angstron Graphene Technology Co., Ltd. (China) provided
graphene oxide (GO).

2.2 Sample Preparation
For the purpose
of grafting ODA onto GO, ODA (0.9 g) and GO (0.5 g) were added into
200 mL of ethanol and the mixture was stirred under reflux for 20
h at 90 °C, then vacuum filtration was carried on. The reaction
product was dissolved again in 200 mL of ethanol and then ultrasonically
dispersed for 5 min, followed by vacuum filtration. Cycle the rinse–filter
process four times, the physically adsorbed and excess ODA would be
cleared away. The GO grafted with ODA was dried under vacuum at 60
°C for 24 h. The dried powder was dissolved in 200 mL of xylene
solution and then ultrasonically dispersed for 30 min. A certain amount
of iPP was added into the above solution to keep the mass fraction
of GO at 5% and stir the mixture at 130 °C for 2 h. Finally,
the solution was vacuum filtered and dried for 24 h to obtain the
iPP/GO masterbatch. On the other hand, to obtain fine dispersion of
β-NA in the matrix, the β-NA masterbatch was also prepared
via a twin extruder (SHJ-20, Nanjing Giant Machinery Co., Ltd., China,
the screw speed was 20 rpm, and the temperature of each part was 185,
195, 200, and 200 °C, respectively) and pelletized to obtain
a masterbatch, and the β-NA concentration was 1 wt %.

After that, the iPP/GO masterbatch, β-NA masterbatch, and iPP
pellets were mixed using the twin extruder again to obtain the β-iPP/GO
composites with a GO concentration of 1 wt % and a WBG-II concentration
of 0.135 wt %. After mixing, the sample was pressed by a pressure
molding machine for further measurement. To benefit discussion, two
iPP (PP-A and PP-B) with GO (1 wt %) and WBG-II (0.135 wt %) were
denoted as NPP-A and NPP-B, respectively.

2.3 Characterization
2.3.1 Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
All the calorimetric
experiments were performed with a Mettler
Toledo DSC1 (Mettler Toledo Corp., Switzerland) differential scanning
calorimeter (DSC) under a nitrogen atmosphere (50 mL/min). 3–5
mg of samples were used. All the melting curves were fitted using
the Peakfit 4.12 software according to the literature.43,44 The relative percentages of the β-crystal (βc) were estimated by the following expression45 1  where the degree
of crystallinities Xα and Xβ associated with α- and β-phases,
respectively.

The crystallization and melting behavior of two
samples were investigated
by the DSC thermal treatment program as shown in Scheme 1. First, all samples were heated
to 200 °C at 10 °C/min and kept for 5 min to erase any previous
thermal histories. Then they were cooled down to Tend = 50 °C or Tend =
100 °C at a cooling rate of 2, 5, 10, 20, and 40 °C/min
respectively. Finally, they were heated to 200 °C at 10 °C/min.

on the β-iPP/GO Composites
2.3.2 Wide-Angle X-ray Diffraction (WAXD)
A DX-1000 (China) diffractometer was used to record the wide-angle
X-ray diffraction (WAXD) behavior of the samples. The basic parameters
of the diffractometer are as follows, the wavelength of Cu Kα
is λ = 0.154 nm, the 2θ test range is 5–35°,
the scanning step is 0.02°, and the scanning rate is 2°/min.
A standard method for determining the content of the β-crystal
is recorded in the references, and the formula used is as follows46 2  where kβ denotes the relative content
of the β-crystal form (WAXD), Hα(110), Hα(040), and Hα(130) are the intensities
of the strongest peaks of the α-form attributed to the (110),
(040), and (130) planes of monoclinic cell, respectively. Hβ(110) is the intensity of the strongest
(110) diffraction peak of the trigonal β-form.

2.3.3 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
A JSM-5900 LV environmental
scanning electron microscope (JEOL, Corp.
Ltd., Japan) was used at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV to observe
the morphology of the samples (scanning electronic microscopy, SEM).
According to the standard procedure in the literature, all the samples
must be etched for 4 h in a solution constituting 65.8 wt % concentrated
phosphoric acid (H3PO4), 1.3 wt % potassium
permanganate (KMnO4), and 32.9 wt % concentrated sulfuric
acid (H2SO4), and then coated with a thin layer
of gold by ion sputtering prior to SEM characterization.47−49

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Nonisothermal Crystallization Behavior
3.1.1 Cooling
Curves
The crystallization
curves of NPP-A and NPP-B at different cooling rates (curve 1 in Scheme 1) are shown in Figure 1. The variations
of the peak, onset, and endset crystallization temperatures (Tc, Tc,onset, and Tc,endset) of the samples are plotted as a function
of the cooling rate in Figure 2.

Figure 1 Cooling curves of (a) NPP-A and (b) NPP-B at different cooling
rates (after being held at 200 °C for 5 min and then cooled under
different rates to Tend = 50 °C).

Figure 2 Variations of the peak, onset and endset crystallization
temperatures
(Tc, Tc,onset, and Tc,endset) of (a) NPP-A and (b)
NPP-B as a function of cooling rate (after being held at 200 °C
for 5 min and then cooled under different rates to Tend = 50 °C).

As shown in Figures 1 and 2, for the samples, the crystallization
temperature and the crystallization peak width (Tc,onset – Tc,endset) become bigger with the increase of the cooling rate. At the same
cooling rate, the Tc of NPP-A is slightly
larger than that of NPP-B by about 1 °C, indicating that NPP-B
prefers to crystallize at a lower temperature. The trend of two samples
is basically the same, and there is no significant difference in crystallization.
Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish the difference in crystallization
ability between the two samples from the crystallization curve.

3.1.2 Nonisothermal Crystallization Kinetics
The semi-crystallization time (t0.5)
of the samples at different cooling rates was calculated using
the following equation 3  A plot of relative crystallinity Xt versus crystallization time is plotted and a crystallization
time of 50% relative crystallinity is recorded as t0.5, which is used to measure the crystallization rate.
The larger the t0.5, the slower the crystallization
rate of the sample. Then the Kissinger method is used to calculate
the crystallization activation energy (Ec) by the following expression 4  where R is the gas constant, D (=dT/dt) is the cooling
rate, and Tc is the crystallization temperature
corresponding to the maximum crystallization rate on the cooling crystallization
curve. Plot 1/Tc with ln(D/Tc2), the crystallization
activation energy (Ec) can be obtained
from the slope. Ec represents the energy
barrier that needs to be overcome for the crystallization of the sample.
The larger the Ec, the more difficult
the sample is to crystallize, and the worse the crystallization ability
of the sample. According to eqs 3 and 4, the half crystallization time t0.5 and crystallization activation energy Ec are calculated and the data are listed in Table 2. Relative crystallinity
as a function of crystallization time of (a) NPP-A and (b) NPP-B are
shown in Figure 3.
The activation energy curves of NPP-A and NPP-B fitted by the Kissinger
method are shown in Figure 4.

(a) NPP-A and (b) NPP-B.

Figure 4 Kissinger plots for evaluating nonisothermal crystallization activation
energies of NPP-A and NPP-B.

Table 2 Half Crystallization Time t0.5 and Crystallization Active Energy Ec of the Samples
 	 	t0.5 (min)	
sample	Ec (KJ/mol)	2 °C/min	5 °C/min	10 °C/min	20 °C/min	40 °C/min	
NPP-A	–232.2	0.75	0.95	0.56	0.32	0.29	
NPP-B	–247.9	0.68	0.93	0.55	0.31	0.21	
The results in Figure 4 and Table 2 show
that the Ec of NPP-B (−247.9
KJ/mol) is smaller than the Ec of NPP-A
(−232.2 KJ/mol), indicating that the crystallizability of NPP-B
has been greatly improved, which has exceeded its counterpart of NPP-A.

On the other hand, the t0.5 of NPP-A
and NPP-B has the same changing trend with the variation of the cooling
rate, that is, the faster the cooling rate, the shorter the t0.5. However, at the same cooling rate, t0.5 of NPP-B is always smaller than NPP-A. As
displayed in Figure 3 and Table 2, NPP-B
has the shortest t0.5 (0.21 min) when
the cooling rate is 40 °C/min and NPP-A has the longest t0.5 (0.75 min) when the cooling rate is 2 °C/min.
In general, the crystallization rate of NPP-B is faster than that
of NPP-A, which is in accordance with the result of activation energy.

It should be emphasized that in the previous study, it was found
that for pure iPP, the t0.5 and Ec of PP-A are all higher than that of PP-B.
Therefore, the finding in this section suggests that under the influence
of β-NA and GO, PP-B with more uniform stereo-defect distribution
exhibits stronger crystallizability compared with PP-A whose stereo-defect
distribution is less uniform.

3.2 Melting
and Polymorphic Behavior
It is reported that the unstable
β-crystals will convert into
the α-phase and affect the polymorphic behavior of PP when the
end temperature of cooling (Tend) is below
100 °C in the cooling process.15,39 Therefore,
by comparing the melting curves of the samples when Tend = 100 °C and Tend = 50 °C, results concerning the thermal stability of the β-phase
can be obtained. To further study the effect of stereo-defect distribution
on the polymorphic behavior of the β-iPP/GO and thermal stability
of the formed β-phase, the melting behavior of NPP-A and NPP-B
was observed after holding at 200 °C for 5 min and then cooling
to Tend = 100 °C and Tend = 50 °C, respectively, at different cooling rates.

The melting curves (curve 2 in Scheme 1) of NPP-A and NPP-B when Tend = 100 °C and Tend = 50 °C are shown in Figures 5 and 6, respectively, whereas
the relative content of β-crystals is shown in Figure 7a. Moreover, the difference
between the β-phase content when Tend = 50 °C and Tend = 100 °C,
βc (Tend = 100 °C)
– βc (Tend = 50
°C), is calculated as shown in Figure 7b. The larger the (Tend = 100 °C) – βc (Tend = 50 °C), the higher the amount of β-phase
that takes part in β–α recrystallization when Tend = 50 °C, and the lower the thermal
stability of the β-phase.

Figure 5 Heating curves of (a) NPP-A and (b) NPP-B
at different cooling
rates (after being held at 200 °C for 5 min and then cooled under
different rates to Tend = 50 °C).

Figure 6 Heating curves of (a) NPP-A and (b) NPP-B at
different cooling
rates (after being held at 200 °C for 5 min and then cooled under
different rates to Tend = 100 °C).

Figure 7 (a) Relative percentages of the β-phase
as a function of
cooling rate of samples after being held at 200 °C for 5 min
and then cooled under different rates to Tend = 100 °C and Tend = 50 °C
and (b) the difference between the β-phase content when Tend = 50 °C and Tend = 100 °C.

As can be seen from Figures 5–7, for NPP-A, the melting
temperatures
of α-phase and β-phase become lower with the increase
of the cooling rate, indicating that NPP-A prefers to form α-
and β-phase with lower lamellar thickness at a higher cooling
rate. This rule also applies to NPP-B. Moreover, two α-melting
points appear on the curve of NPP-B when the cooling rate is over
5 °C/min, since the unstable β-phase changes into α-crystal
nucleus during the melting process, which then induces α-recrystallization
and results in the recrystallized α-phase with a higher melting
temperature.

On the other hand, it can be seen that both NPP-A
and NPP-B form
more amounts of β-crystals at a low cooling rate and the relative
content of β-crystals formed by NPP-B is much higher than that
of NPP-A, indicating that for β-iPP/GO composites, the iPP matrix
with more uniform stereo-defect distribution is more favorable for
the formation of a higher amount of β-phase.

Comparing
the results of Figure 5 (Tend = 50 °C) and Figure 6 (Tend = 100 °C), it can be seen that when Tend = 100 °C, the relative contents of the β-phase
of both NPP-A and NPP-B are obviously enhanced and the α-double
peak formed by β–α recrystallization on the melting
curve of NPP-B disappears, indicating that the influence of β–α
phase transition during the melting process is eliminated.

Moreover,
the difference between the β-phase content when Tend = 50 °C and Tend =
100 °C, βc (Tend = 100 °C) – βc (Tend = 50 °C), can be regarded as an indicator of
the thermal stability of the β-phase during the melting process.
It can be seen that the higher the cooling rate, the larger the βc (Tend = 100 °C) –
βc (Tend = 50 °C)
for both NPP-A and NPP-B, indicating that the composites of both NPP-A
and NPP-B prefer to form more β-crystals with less thermal stability
at a higher cooling rate. Meanwhile, the βc (Tend = 100 °C) – βc (Tend = 50 °C) value of NPP-B is
always higher than its counterpart of NPP-A, suggesting that NPP-B
is more preferred to form the β-phase with less thermal stability,
which should be attributed to its more uniform stereo-defect distribution.

3.3 WAXD
To understand fully, the WAXD
test is carried out in this section. The samples are disposed as follows.
First, put the molded sheet specimens in the drying oven at 200 °C
for 20 min to erase any previous thermal history. Then, the specimens
were cooled under three different conditions, that is, (1) taking
out the specimens from the oven immediately and placing them into
cold water for fast cooling (named A-F and B-F, cooling rate of about
200 °C/min), (2) taking out the sheets and placing them at room
temperature for medium speed cooling (named A-M and B-M, cooling rate
of about 50 °C/min), and (3) leaving the specimens in the oven
for slow cooling (named A-S and B-S, cooling rate about 1 °C/min).
The WAXD results are shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8 WAXD profiles of (a) NPP-A and (b) NPP-B after being held
at 200
°C for 5 min and then cooled under three kinds of cooling rates
to room temperature.

It should be noted that since WAXD is measured at room temperature,
the obtained β-phase content (kβ) from WAXD is not confused by the thermal stability of the β-phase. Figure 8 reveals that for
both NPP-A and NPP-B, the kβ value
is obviously enhanced at the fast cooling rate, indicating that the
fast cooling rate is more favorable for the formation of a high content
of β-phase no matter the stereo-defect distribution of the iPP
matrix. Meanwhile, the β-phase of NPP-B is evidently higher
than its counterpart of NPP-A, which is in line with the DSC results
above.

3.4 SEM Observation
To directly study
the polymorphic morphologies of the samples, the temperature-treated
sheets described above were etched and then subjected to SEM measurement.

At a slow cooling rate (Figure 9a,b), NPP-A (A-S) forms a large amount of highly stable
α-crystals (relatively dark areas in the image), which are quite
difficult to be etched. Meanwhile, a small amount of β-crystals
(loosely stacked lamellae structures in the relatively bright area
in the image) randomly distributed in the image. In clear contrast,
for NPP-B (B-S), a high amount of large-sized β-crystals can
be observed, indicating that NPP-B with more uniform stereo-defect
distribution has a stronger ability to form a large amount of β-crystals
even during slow cooling. At a medium cooling rate (Figure 9c,d), a small amount of β-crystals
can be observed in NPP-A (A-M), whereas large amounts of β-crystals
with relatively small size exist in NPP-B. At a fast cooling rate
(Figure 9e,f), the
crystalline sizes of both NPP-A and NPP-B decrease evidently, whereas
their β-phase content further increases. In general, the results
of SEM more intuitively reflect the crystalline structure and polymorphic
behavior of the composites, which are in accordance with the results
of DSC and WAXD. For β-iPP/GO composites, although the crystallization
conditions (cooling rate) greatly influence the polymorphic behavior
and crystalline structures of the composites, the uniformity of the
stereo-defect distribution is found to be the first factor determining
the formation of the β-phase.

(b) B-S, (c) A-M, (d) B-M,
(e) A-F, and (f) B-F after being held at 200 °C for 5 min and
then cooled under different cooling rates to room temperature.

4 Conclusions
In this study, using two iPP with similar average isotacticity
and molecular weight, but different uniformities of stereo-defect
distribution, the β-iPP/GO composites (NPP-A and NPP-B) were
prepared to investigate the effect of stereo-defect distribution on
the nonisothermal crystallization kinetics and polymorphic melting
behavior. The results revealed that in the case of β-iPP/GO
composites, in the aspect of crystallization, more uniform stereo-defect
distribution leads to a slight increase of the crystallization rate
and decrease of the crystallization activation energy Ec. Meanwhile, for melting behavior, NPP-B with more uniform
stereo-defect is more favorable for the formation of a large amount
of β-phase. Moreover, the role of the cooling rate was also
discussed. The higher the cooling rate, the higher the β-phase
content and the smaller the crystalline sizes, meanwhile, the higher
the amount of β-phase with relatively lower thermal stability
that will take part in β–α recrystallization during
the subsequent melting process. It should be noted that for β-iPP/GO
composites, although the cooling rate greatly influences the polymorphic
behavior and crystalline structures of the composites, the uniformity
of stereo-defect distribution is found to be the first factor determining
the formation of β-phase.
