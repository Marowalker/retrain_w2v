Two novel Cu(II)-based metal–organic
frameworks [C40H34Cu2N6O18 (1) and C20H18CuN2O10 (2)] have been synthesized using
2-aminopyrimidine or pyrazine
ligands and phthalate ion and characterized spectroscopically and
by X-ray single-crystal diffraction. Both 1 and 2 show electrical conductivity and photosensitivity, evidencing
their potentiality in optoelectronic device applications. Experimental
and theoretical investigations revealed that the electrical conductivity
under irradiation of visible light increases compared to that under
dark condition (photosensitive Schottky barrier diode behavior), especially
in complex 2. Both 1 and 2 have
been successfully applied in technologically challenging thin-film
active devices.

Introduction
Assembly and functionalization
of metal–organic frameworks
(MOFs) are attractive and one of the crucial topics in crystal engineering.
MOFs are crystalline coordination polymers comprising organic ligands
as spacers and metal-containing inorganic clusters as secondary building
units1−3 to create porous and open frameworks.4 Due to their high surface area, uniform yet tunable porosity,
and rich chemical functionality, enormous attempts have been made
for the synthesis of MOFs with a new structure with novel topology
and potential applications in the emerging fields of storage, separation,
sensing, catalysis, optoelectronic devices, etc.5−11 The promising class of MOF has strongly promoted the research of
hybrid organic–inorganic solids comprising the association
of metallic centers with organic O- and/or N-donor ligands for the
formation of novel crystalline periodic networks.12,13 Syntheses of MOFs are influenced by various factors such as the
reaction conditions that include nature of anions, coordination geometry
of the central atom, temperature, solvent, and flexibility of the
organic ligands, either singly or multiply.14−17 Therefore, it is extremely important
to normalize the reaction conditions and design the organic ligands
to achieve at the target frameworks with precise structures and functions.
The analysis of topology for MOFs is not only an effective tool for
simplifying the intricate structures but also plays a significant
role in the design of MOFs with specific properties. So far, although
enormous effort has been made on the rational design and controlled
synthesis of MOFs,18−20 it is still an arduous challenge to predict the final
architectures and properties of the obtained MOFs. On the other hand,
technologically it is very challenging to successfully fabricate MOF
devices by solution processing method. To optimize the performance
of the devices, detailed analysis of the charge-transport properties
is also of extreme significance.9−11

The hallmark of molecular
solid-state materials is the attractive
tailorability of their properties by judicious modification of the
molecular architecture. The recognition and assembly of designer building
blocks by fine-tuning of covalent and particularly weak noncovalent
interactions like hydrogen bonding, π···π
stacking, and hydrophobic interactions play a crucial role in directing
the properties of materials.21−31 In the last few years, relevant people note an emergent interest
in supramolecular processes for the generation of novel materials
with fascinating properties.32,33 In this context, MOFs
offer a dynamic methodology that provides bond energies between the
strong covalent bonds and the weak noncovalent interactions. Self-assembly
via weak interaction has been revealed as the most powerful protocol
to generate predesigned and well-defined structures.

The functional
group of phthalic acid can adopt several coordinated
modes like terminal monodentate, chelating one metal ion, and bridging
two metal ions in a syn–syn, syn–anti, anti–anti,
and tridentate form to construct fascinating architecture. In continuation
with our quest for MOFs,34−36 we have chosen phthalic acid
as primary ligand, considering its ability to get involved in metal
centers that can promote diverse structural and topological features.
We report herein the structural features of two new Cu(II) complexes
based on a suitable choice of combinations of the phthalic acid as
primary ligand and different diazine derivatives as secondary ligands.
Charge-transfer properties, which are invariably related to the device
applications, have been studied for both the complexes. The applicability
of the synthesized materials in optoelectronic devices, behaving as
a photosensitive Schottky barrier diode (SBD), has been studied experimentally
and explained on the basis of theoretical calculation, which are useful
to rationalize the greater conductivity of complex 2 compared
to 1 upon illumination.

Results and Discussion
Structural
Description of 1
Single-crystal
X-ray diffraction study reveals that complex 1 has a
discrete dinuclear structure in which two Cu(II) ions are located
in equivalent sites with an octahedral coordination environment. The
ORTEP view of the title structure is presented in Figure 1. The coordination environment
is centrosymmetric as Cu(II) occupies an inversion center and the
coordination geometry may be considered as a Jahn–Teller distorted
octahedron. Each metal center is coordinatively bonded with four carboxylate
oxygen atoms from four bridging phthalate groups, one pyrimidine ring
nitrogen atom, and the sixth position occupied by another Cu(II) ion.
The title structure consists of phthalate-bridged centrosymmetric
dinuclear units with a Cu–Cu distance of 2.6820(9) Å.
The four carboxylate groups bridge the two Cu(II) atoms, generating
a Cu2(OCO)4 paddle-wheel-type cage with an almost
orthogonal arrangement of the chelate rings. The Cu–O(phthalate)
distances are within the normal range (from 1.964(3) to 1.971(3) Å),
whereas the axial Cu–N distance is 2.201(3) Å. Selected
bond lengths and angles are listed in Table S2. A detailed account on the supramolecular forces that govern the
crystal packing of compound 1 is given in the Supporting Information.

Structural Description of 2
The asymmetric
unit of complex 2 is shown in Figure 2. The pyrazine ring and the Cu(II) position
on a 2-fold axis, and the phthalate and one water molecule on an inversion
center. The Cu(II) is six-coordinated by two carboxylate oxygen atoms
from two phthalate ligands, two nitrogen atoms from pyrazine ligands,
and two oxygen atoms from solvent water molecules exhibiting a slightly
distorted CuO4N2 octahedral coordination geometry. Table S2 lists selected bond parameters.

Complex 2 is a two-dimensional (2D) supramolecular
framework based on one-dimensional (1D) zigzag polymeric chain along
the [001] direction (see Figure 3). The parallel 1D zigzag chains are interconnected
through O–H···O hydrogen bonds, as further described
in the Supporting Information to generate
2D assemblies in the solid state.

Optical Characterization
In this study, the optical
spectra of complexes 1 and 2 (inset Figure 4) have been recorded
for the deposited thin films of our synthesized materials by preparing
a well dispersion in dimethylformamide, in the range of 250–800
nm. The absorption spectrum of both 1 and 2 exhibits absorption in the visible region, and optical band gaps
have been estimated using Tauc equations (eq 1).37 1  where “α” is
the absorption
coefficient, “Eg” is the
band gap, “h” is Planck’s constant,
“ν” is the frequency of light, and the exponent
“n” is the electron transition process-dependent
constant. “A” is a constant, which
is taken as 1 for ideal case. To calculate direct optical band gap,
the value of n has been considered as 1/2.37 Using the above equation, from the extrapolation
of (αhν)2 vs hν plot (Figure 4), the direct optical band gap (Eg) has
been evaluated as 2.27 and 1.92 eV for our synthesized complexes 1 and 2, respectively.

spectra (inset) and Tauc’s plots
for complexes 1 and 2, respectively.

Dielectric Characterization
The estimated optical band
gap has fallen right well within the semiconductor limit that motivated
us to check the electrical conductivities of the synthesized complexes
in terms of dielectric study. Impedance spectroscopy is one of the
widely used powerful tools for the characterization of electrical
properties of semiconducting materials. In this study, we have evaluated
the capacitance (C), impedance (Z), and phase angle (θ) of the sample as a function of frequency.
The dielectric study has been performed as a function of frequency
at room temperature using a computer-controlled Agilent precision
4294A LCR meter in the frequency range of 40 Hz to 11 MHz.

Figure 5A represents the
complex plane impedance plot, i.e., the Nyquist plot, for complexes 1 and 2, from which it can be clearly seen that
the impedance reveals prominent arc of semicircle for both materials.
The semicircle in the high-frequency region may be contributed by
semiconducting grains and generated resistance at the electrode. The
semicircle also represents the charge-transfer resistance at the electrode/composite
interface, and the bulk resistance Rb (direct
current (DC) resistance) of the complexes has been calculated from
the radius of the corresponding semicircle. In Figure 5A, it can be seen that complex 2 shows small semicircular arc, which signifies small bulk resistance
(Rb) rather than complex 1. This observation primarily suggests the better conducting nature
of complex 2. The estimated values of bulk resistance
for both the complexes are listed in Table 1.

for complexes 1 and 2.

To extend
the dielectric study, we have plotted Bode phase diagrams
of our complexes (Figure 5B). The Bode phase plot represents the characteristic peak
position of the complexes from which the recombination lifetime or
electron lifetime (τn) can be determined using eq 2.38 2  The calculated
electron lifetimes (τn) of both 1 and 2 are listed in Table 2. From this study,
it can be easily concluded that the characteristic frequency is related
to the electron lifetime. The longer electron lifetime corresponds
to a smaller frequency.

The interior-related information
of the semiconductor can be achieved
from the analysis of alternating current (AC) conductivity. It is
the most preferable study in the case of low conductivity analysis
and when the conduction process is electrode-limited.39

The frequency vs AC conductivity plot of our synthesized
complexes
(1 and 2) is presented in Figure 6A. If the conductivity is governed
by the free carriers, then it decreases with increase in frequency.40 In this case, the conductivity obeyed the frequency-dependent
empirical law and is given by the power law of the form (3) 3  where σ(ω),
σDC, and σAC are the total conductivity,
DC conductivity,
and AC conductivity, respectively. In the above equation, the frequency-dependent
part is the AC conductivity, which obeys the relation 4  where A is a constant and s is a number at room temperature. The number s depends on the frequencies. The frequency (f)-dependent
variation of the capacitance (C) at constant bias
potential is shown in Figure 6B. At room temperature, the capacitance of the complexes (1 and 2) decreases in the low-frequency region.
In the high-frequency region, the capacitance of the complexes (1 and 2) becomes saturated. From that saturated
region, the relative permittivity of the complexes (1 and 2) can been calculated employing the following
equation37 5  where ε0, εr, C, d, and A are
the permittivity of free space, dielectric constant of the synthesized
material, capacitance of the synthesized material (at saturation),
and thickness and effective area of the thin film, respectively. The
dielectric constants (εr) of 1 and 2 are calculated (Table 1) using eq 5.

Electrical Characterization
The impedance analysis
and the observed direct optical band gap of the complexes represent
the semiconductor behavior of our synthesized complexes. This encourages
us to investigate the electrical properties of complexes 1 and 2. To perform this study, metal (Al)–semiconductor
(synthesized complexes 1 and 2) (MS) junction
thin-film devices have been fabricated because of the easy solution
processability of our complexes. The thin-film device has been fabricated
in indium tin oxide (ITO)/complex (1 or 2)/Al sandwich structure. To assure that our complexes construct a
junction with metal (Al), multiple devices have been fabricated for
analyzing the electrical properties. The current–voltage (I–V) measurements of complexes 1 and 2-based multiple devices have been carried
out with a Keithley 2635B sourcemeter under dark and under AM1.5G
photoirradiation at different applied bias voltages within the limit
±2 V.

With the ITO/complex (1 or 2) ohmic contact, the representative I–V characteristics of the Al/complex (1 or 2) under dark and illumination conditions are displayed in Figure 7. The conductivity
of the synthesized complexes under dark condition has been measured
as 2.02 × 10–6 and 2.34 × 10–6 S m–1 for complexes 1 and 2-based thin films, respectively. However, with photoirradiation,
the conductivities of complexes 1 and 2 have
improved to 4.34 × 10–6 and 7.6 × 10–6 S m–1, respectively, which is a
recognizable improvement from the nonirradiated conditions.

Figure 7 Current–voltage
(I–V) characteristics curve
for ITO/complex (1)/Al and ITO/complex
(2)/Al structured thin-film devices.

The representative I–V characteristics (Figure 7) of our synthesized complexes-based devices exhibit nonlinear
rectifying nature signifying it as Schottky barrier diode (SBD). Moreover,
these I–V characteristics
demonstrate the highly influencing rectifying nature under illumination
condition. Hence, the photosensitivities of the complexes 1 and 2 have been calculated as 2.27 and 3.77, respectively.
At ±2 V under dark condition, the rectification ratios (Ion/Ioff) of the
complexes 1 and 2-based SBD have been found
to be 8.46 and 8.49, respectively, whereas the same have been found
to be 13.98 and 20.06 after light soaking for complexes 1 and 2, respectively. This result represents an enhancement
of rectification ratios after light soaking.

The I–V characteristics
of complexes 1 and 2-based Schottky diode
have been further analyzed by thermionic emission theory. To extract
important diode parameters, Cheung’s method has been employed
here.37 In this regard, considering the
following standard equations, we have started I–V analysis quantitatively37,41 6   7  where I0, q, k, T, V, A, η, and A* denote saturation
current, electronic charge, the Boltzmann constant, temperature in
Kelvin, forward-bias voltage, effective diode area, ideality factor,
and the effective Richardson constant, respectively. Here, the effective
diode area has been estimated as 7.065 × 10–2 cm2 and the effective Richardson constant has been considered
as 32 A K–2 cm–2 for all of the
devices. Linearity in current has been observed at low bias, which
is consistent with eq 6. As the diode series resistance changes at higher bias voltage,
a deviation from linearity in the I–V curve takes place. From Cheung, in terms of series resistance,
the forward-bias I–V characteristics
can be expressed as37 8  where IRS is the
voltage drop across series resistance of device. In this context,
the values of the series resistance can be determined from the following
functions using eq 8.42 9  Equation 9 also can
be expressed as a function of I as 10  The series resistance (RS) and ideality factor (η) for all devices under dark
and illumination condition have been estimated from the slope and
intercept of dV/dln I vs I plot (Figure 8A) and are listed in Table 2. Estimated nonideal (∼1) values of ideality
factor depict the nonideal formation of MS junction. This deviation
may be due to the presence of in homogeneities at the barrier of Schottky
junction. The existence of interface states and series resistance
also causes that type of deviation at the barrier of junction.43,44 However, the important observation is that the value of ideality
factor of both the complexes approached more ideal (closer to 1) after
light soaking. This generally indicates the less interfacial charge
recombination and better homogeneity at the barrier of Schottky junctions.45 That observation illustrates that under photoirradiation
condition, our synthesized complexes possess less carrier recombination
at the junction, which signifies better barrier homogeneity. The value
of series resistance RS has been determined
from the slope of the dV/dln I vs I plot (Figure 8A).

Figure 8 (A) dV/dln I vs I and (B) H vs I curves
under dark and illumination condition for the complexes 1 and 2-based thin-film devices.

The values of barrier height (ϕB) have been
determined
from the slope and intercept of H(I) vs I plot (Figure 8B) using the just obtained ideality factor (η)
values in eq 10 and
are listed in Table 2. For all of the complexes-based SBDs, the potential barrier height
is found to be reduced when they are exposed to illumination. This
decrement in the barrier potential height may be due to the effect
of the generation of photoinduced charge carriers and their accumulation
near the conduction band. The measured potential height (ϕB), ideality factor (η), and series resistance (RS) under dark and illumination condition for
the metal (Al)–semiconductor (synthesized compounds) (MS) junctions
are listed in Table 2. Using Cheung’s functions, the series resistance obtained
from both the processes (eqs 9 and 10) shows good consistency, which
is found to decrease upon light illumination (Table 2). All of the parameters represent a better
performance for complex 2-based SBDs even under illumination
condition than complex 1-based SBDs, which signifies
its applicability in the field of optoelectronics devices.

Metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs), also known as porous coordination
polymers, represent an interesting type of solid crystalline materials
that can be straightforwardly self-assembled through the coordination
of metal ions/clusters with organic linkers. Compared to conventional
light-harvesting organic polymers, MOFs possess long-range order.46 This long-range crystalline order of MOFs implies
that charge transport through delocalized conduction and valence bands
typical of crystalline inorganic semiconductors is possible.47 Emergence of delocalized bands in MOFs will
require that the π orbitals in the linker groups overlap effectively
with the metal d orbitals. The dispersion in ground- and excited-state
electronic band structures is the resultant of the semiconducting
nature of MOFs. The modification of the linker structure could lead
to better charge transfer between the linker and the metal cations
of the framework. The long-range crystalline order also could lead
to higher charge mobility and energy-transfer rates by minimizing
traps, dead ends, and defects.

To date, three types of charge-carrier
transport mechanisms have
been identified in hybrid organic–inorganic structure: (i)
through-bond conduction, (ii) by guest molecules, and (iii) through-space
conduction (charge delocalization due to the close approach of adjacent
aromatic linkers). In this study, the mechanism for light-induced
charge-carrier transport would be through-bond conduction. In through-bond
conduction, charge moves through continuous chains of covalent and
coordination bonds in the material. Typically, this mechanism involves
the so-called “hopping transport”. When the excited
photoelectrons migrate from the highest occupied molecular orbital
to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, it generates the transient
photocurrent response. The conductance value and the number of free
carriers produced at the time of light irradiation in the semiconductor
are mainly evaluated by the transient photocurrent response.48

For a better investigation of the charge-transport
behavior, the
log I vs log V plot
has been analyzed under both conditions (Figure 9A).

Figure 9 (A) log I vs log V curve and (B) I vs V2 curves under both dark and illumination conditions for
the complexes 1 and 2-based thin-film devices.

Figure 9A reveals
that there are two distinguishable slopes with different values, which
have been marked as region I and region II. The current and voltage
show a proportional relation, i.e., a Ohmic relation (I ∝ V), in region I. In this regime, the slope
of the plot is ∼1. After a certain voltage, the slope of the
plot becomes ∼2 (region II, Figure 9A). In this regime, the relation of current
and voltage turns into I ∝ V2, which signifies the trap free space charge limited
current (SCLC) regime.37,45 In this region, the quantity
of injected carriers is higher than that of the background carriers,
which generates a space charge field. Hence, this space charge field
controls the flow of current and thus they are known as SCLC. The
SCLC theory, which has recently drawn popular attention, was adopted
here to estimate the mobility of materials.37,42

Following this model, the effective carrier mobility has been
estimated
from higher-voltage region of the I vs V2 plot (Figure 9B) by Mott–Gurney equation37,42,45 11  where d is the thickness
of the film, which was considered about ∼1 μm for our
device. Transit time (τ) and diffusion length (LD) of the charge carriers are few more key parameters
that have also been estimated to analyze charge transport across the
junction. For this purpose, τ has been evaluated from eq 12, by using the slope
of the SCLC region (region II) in logarithmic representation of forward I–V curve, shown in Figure 9A.37 The diffusion length of the charge carriers has been further extracted
from eq 13 12   13  where D is the diffusion
coefficient. Carrier lifetime has been extracted from the slope of
the region II in log I vs log V graph, which has been shown in Figure 9A. Using the Einstein–Smoluchowski
equation,37 the diffusion coefficient has
been calculated as 14  Diffusion length (LD) and the density
of states (DOS) at the Fermi level of charge carriers
are two important parameters that play an influential role in device
performance after formation of an MS junction. The DOS distribution
of the active films around the Fermi level N(EF) has been extracted from I–V characteristics by using the simple relation37 15  where 16  where N(EF) is the density of localized states near the Fermi level
and other parameters are described earlier. The calculated values
of all of the parameters in the SCLC region are listed in Table 3. The increase of
effective mobility under irradiation condition depicts the higher
transport rate of the charge carrier. The number of generating charge
carriers also increased under photoirradiation condition. Under illumination
condition, the charge carrier voyages more paths before being recombined,
i.e., the diffusion length of the charge carrier increases. As a result,
the current of the devices eventually increases under illumination
condition. From these obtained values, it can be clearly stated that
the charge-transport properties of our synthesized materials improved
after light soaking (Table 3). All of the diode parameters of the complex 2-based SBDs demonstrate much enhanced charge-transfer properties
after light soaking than complex 1. So, this kind of
material can pave the way for a very promising future in device applications.

All of the parameters from electrical characterization show better
result for complex 2 -based devices rather than complex 1-based ones. This may be due to the polymeric nature of complex 2, which affects the electrical conductivity at a given photon
absorption energy. In this study, discrete complex 1 forms
1D chain by involving noncovalent hydrogen-bonding interactions, but
complex 2 is a coordination polymer. The electron-transfer
mechanism in complex 1 is mediated by hydrogen bonds,49 whereas it is facilitated by regular periodicity
of conjugated π system with intervening Cu(II) metal center
in complex 2.50 This regular
periodicity for complex 2 leads to the improvement in
device performances.51 It might be mentioned
here that a comparison of the conductivities of recently reported
Cu-MOFs with our synthesized compounds 1 and 2 (Table S6) shows that our materials have
sufficient potentiality in optoelectronic applications.

An essential
property of any active material used for light harvesting
is that it must absorb solar radiation in the critical visible to
near-IR region that comprises most of the photons incident upon earth.
Since MOFs consist of both a metal ion and an organic linker, there
are numerous possibilities for designing frameworks that can achieve
this. Beyond light absorption, the advantageous property of MOFs’
use as active materials in electronic and optoelectronic devices is
their charge mobility. Most MOFs exhibit localized electronic structure
with little mixing between the metal-ion atomic orbitals and the linker
molecular orbitals. The modification of the electronic structure of
the linker is probably a better strategy for tailoring the light absorption
properties.52 MOF-based optoelectronic
devices could be made to optimally absorb the photoirradiation by
introducing a range of appropriate sensitizing molecules; they could
be made extremely thin, flexible, and light due to their porosity
and structural stability; and they will likely be solution-processable,
which substantially decreases their cost of production, a major factor
in the low rate of usage and availability of photovoltaics.

Computational
Study
The calculations were carried out
by using the standard band theory and the partial density of states
(PDOS) calculation (see Supporting Information for detailed theoretical methods). The results from these calculations
evidence that both complexes 1 and 2 are
semiconductors with band gap values of 2.26 and 1.62 eV, respectively
(Figure 10). The band
gap values from DFT calculations are in good accordance with the experimentally
obtained values of 2.27 and 1.92 eV, demonstrating that these materials
belong to the semiconductor family and corroborated by the DOS calculations,
which are depicted in Figures 11 and 12. In both compounds 1 and 2, the PDOS calculation shows that the
valence bands are mainly dominated by Cu 3d states. In addition, the
main contributors to the conduction band are p-orbitals, that is,
the p-component of the pyrazine ligand in complex 2 and
the p-component of the pyrimidine and phthalate ligands in complex 1. The representation of the electronic band structure in
compounds 1 and 2 along with the PDOS analyses
reveal the existence of deeply isolated intermediate bands, which
mainly consist of Cu 3d orbitals and the p-orbitals of phthalate ligand
(Figures 10–12). The presence of intermediate levels has been
experimentally characterized in other inorganic semiconductors and
has been attributed to orbital interactions between Cu and N.53 However, in our case, these levels are not found
experimentally because they are very weakly populated. For this reason,
we have not considered these intermediate levels for the calculation
of the band gap in both crystals.

To properly understand the electronic structure of the solid-state
material, it is important to compute and analyze the optical properties
(shown in Figure 13), since they provide some information regarding the character of
the bands. In a given material, the frequency dependence of an incident
photon can be studied by computing the dielectric function ε(ω).
Its imaginary part (Im) is computed taking into consideration the
interband optical transitions. It is necessary to calculate the momentum
matrix elements between the occupied and unoccupied wave functions.
Moreover, the real part (Re) is acquired by using the Kramer–Kronig
transform.54 The Re part of ε(ω)
gives information about the polarization degree of the material upon
the application of an electric field. The Im part is a good indicator
of the absorption in the material of the incident photon. We have
used the computed band structure to measure the optical response.
To do so, we have selected a photon energy range of 0–16 eV. Figure 13A shows that the
Re component of ε(ω) in the low-energy region increases
with the photon energy reaching a maximum at 3.7 eV. This increment
of the dielectric function is higher for the case of the complex 2, which agrees with its higher conductivity.55 The imaginary parts of dielectric functions have two main
peaks for complex 2 at 4.1–5.0 eV, while for 1, a main peak at 4.2 eV and one shoulder at 4.8 eV are observed.

functions (A) real and imaginary parts of the dielectric
function and (B) real part of the conductivity of complexes 1 and 2 averaged over all polarization directions.

Finally, in Figure 13B, we represent the optical
conductivity for complexes 1 (dashed line) and 2 (solid line). The optical conductivity
is useful to analyze how the conductivity of the material changes
upon illumination. The electrical conductivity and, concomitantly,
the photoconductivity of the material increase as a consequence of
photon absorption.56 As can be seen in
the graph, the shape of the real part of conductivity in complex 2 is greater than that presented by complex 1. This fact explains the greater conductivity of complex 2 (Experimental Section) upon illumination.
This is likely due to the polymeric nature of complex 2, which affects the electrical conductivity at a given photon absorption
energy.

Conclusions
This report illustrates
some emerging opportunities of MOFs in
electronic and optoelectronic devices. The combination of long-range
order and synthetic flexibility manifested by the presence of both
metal ions and organic linkers in a predetermined spatial orientation
of the MOFs enables a wide range of tunable properties useful in functional
devices. In this work, we have illustrated two new photosensitive
Cu-based MOFs that exhibit Schottky diode character. The electrical
conductivity of both the complexes in the Al/(1 or 2)/ITO configuration shows that it increases under illumination,
indicating its photosensitivity under visible light exposure. The
Schottky barrier diode parameters obtained experimentally for complex 2 (coordination polymer) demonstrate much enhanced charge-transfer
properties after light soaking than complex 1 (discrete
complex). Theoretical studies have been used to rationalize the experimental
observations and to provide an explanation to the greater conductivity
of 2. Since these complexes are easy to synthesize, they
are promising candidates to have applications in MOF semiconducting
industries and in the fabrication of optoelectronic devices.

Experimental
Section
Physical Measurements
IR spectra (KBr pellet) were
recorded on a PerkinElmer RXI FT-IR spectrophotometer in the range
of 4000–400 cm–1. PerkinElmer 240C elemental
analyzer was used for elemental analysis (C, H, N).

Materials
All reactions were carried out in aqueous
medium under aerobic condition. Phthalic acid, copper(II) nitrate
trihydrate, 2-aminopyrimidine, and pyrazine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Chemical Co. and used without further purification.

Synthesis of
Complex 1
Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.241 g, 1.0 mmol) dissolved
in 25 mL of water was allowed to react with phthalic acid (0.332 g,
2.0 mmol) in water (25 mL) at 60 °C, resulting in a clear blue
solution. A warm aqueous solution (20 mL) of 2-aminopyrimidine (0.190
g, 2.0 mmol) was added dropwise to the above solution with stirring.
The reaction mixture thus obtained was further heated at 60 °C
for an hour and then cooled to room temperature, filtered, and kept
undisturbed for crystallization. After a few days, block-shaped dark
green single crystals suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained. The
crystals were collected by filtration, washed with cold water, and
dried in air (yield: 65%). Anal. calcd for C40H34Cu2N6O18: C, 47.39; H, 3.38; N,

(s).

Synthesis of Complex 2
The synthesis of
complex 2 was achieved using methods identical to those
for complex 1. Here, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.241 g, 1.0 mmol) dissolved in 25 mL of water was allowed
to react with phthalic acid (0.332 g, 2.0 mmol) in water (25 mL) at
60 °C, resulting in a clear blue solution. A warm aqueous solution
(20 mL) of pyrazine (0.160 g, 2.0 mmol) was added dropwise to the
above solution with stirring. This solution was then heated at 60
°C for an hour and then cooled to room temperature, filtered,
and kept undisturbed for crystallization. Block-shaped blue single
crystals suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained after a few days,
which were collected by filtration, washed with cold water, and dried
in air (yield: 62%). Anal. calcd for C20H18CuN2O10: C, 47.11; H, 3.56; N, 5.49%. Found: C, 47.05;
H, 3.51; N, 5.53%. Main IR absorption bands observed for 2 (KBr pellet, cm–1): 3535 (s), 3411 (s), 2916 (b),
2793 (b), 2617 (b), 2497 (b), 1871 (b), 1700 (s), 1542 (s), 1494 (s),
1453 (s), 1412 (s), 1268 (s), 1157 (s), 1123 (s), 1075 (s), 1054 (s),
958 (s), 889 (s), 841 (s), 800 (s), 772 (s), 697 (s), 649 (s), 593
(s), 532 (s).

Theoretical Methods
The P21/n primitive monoclinic crystal
structure and C2/c monoclinic crystal
structure of the
complexes 1 and 2 were optimized with the
density functional theory method using the CASTEP program code of
Accelrys, Inc.57 They were relaxed with
the experimental unit cell parameter fixes. The calculations were
performed by the generalized gradient approximation and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
formulation for the exchange-correlation functional.58,59 Ultrasoft pseudopotentials were used in this work with the relativistic
Koelling–Harmon treatment.60 A plane-wave
basis set with 350 eV cutoff was applied. The k-mesh
points over the Brillouin zone were generated with parameters 4 ×
4 × 4 in the Monkhorst–Pack scheme.61 The energy tolerance for self-consistent field convergence
was 2 × 10–6 eV/atom for all calculations.
The long-range dispersion correction has been included in the calculations
with the Grimme’s scheme.62 Band
structures were calculated along the k-vector of
the first Brillouin zone of the crystal, and partial density of states
(PDOS) were plotted with respect to the Fermi level. The optical properties,
including dielectric function and optical conductivity, of the crystal
were calculated. The optical properties are averaged over all polarization
directions, thereby imitating an experiment on a polycrystalline sample.
A smearing of 0.2 eV was employed. A scissor operator of +0.3 eV was
employed for the optical properties calculations of complex 2.
