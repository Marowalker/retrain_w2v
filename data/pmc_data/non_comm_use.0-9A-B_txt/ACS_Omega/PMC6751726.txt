The
effect of the anionic structure of ionic liquids (ILs) and
water/IL ratio on the dissolution behavior of maize starch at room
temperature (22–23 °C) was investigated. The ILs used
were 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C2mim][Cl]),
1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium formate ([C2mim][HCOO]), and
1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([C2mim][CH3COO]). The structural analysis indicated that the long- and short-range
molecular order in the starch after treatment with water/[C2mim][Cl] and water/[C2mim][HCOO] mixtures decreased with
the decreasing water/IL ratio from 10:1 to 2:1 and was completely
disrupted at the 2:1 ratio. However, the ordered structure of starch
was disrupted completely in the water/[C2mim][CH3COO] ratio of 5:1. The disruption extent of starch structures followed
the order: [C2mim][CH3COO] > [C2mim][HCOO]
> [C2mim][Cl] at water/IL ratios of 10:1 and 5:1, but
the
opposite was observed at lower water/IL ratio (2:1). Our results clearly
showed that both the nature of the anion and water/IL ratio affected
the dissolution behavior of maize starch. The hydrogen bonding capacity
of IL anions and viscosity of water/IL mixtures were proposed to play
the key roles in the structural disruption of starch. These findings
would be of great importance for rationally designing “green
and sustainable” processes for the utilization of promising
natural biopolymers.

==== Body
Introduction
The utilization of natural biopolymers
(e.g., cellulose, starch,
chitosan etc.) to replace synthetic polymers for the manufacture of
green materials has recently gained worldwide interest due to growing
global environmental awareness, concepts of sustainability, and avoiding
conflict between production of food and raw materials for industry.1 Starch is one of the most abundant, inexpensive,
and renewable natural polymers that has been utilized widely in the
food, chemistry, fermentation, paper, and pharmaceutical industries.2 Native starch is composed of amylose and amylopectin,
which are arranged into semicrystalline granules, which are studied
at structural scales ranging from nanometer to micrometer.3 The multiscale structures of starch are the major
determinants of starch functionality for industrial applications.4 The insolubility of starch in most traditional
solvents, due to the extensive hydrogen bonding in native granules,
limits its applications.5 Conventional
solvents for starch dissolution, for example, dimethyl sulfoxide, N-methylmorpholine N-oxide, and N,N-dimethylacetamide, have limitations
and disadvantages, such as, volatility, flammability, and not being
recyclable.6 Finding an environmentally
friendly solvent for starch dissolution is an important task for expanding
starch applications.

Ionic liquids (ILs), which consist of an
organic cation and an
organic or inorganic anion, are attracting attention as replacements
for volatile organic solvents for dissolving polysaccharides because
of their desirable physicochemical properties such as negligible vapor
pressure, nonflammability, high chemical stability, recyclability,
and miscibility.7,8 They have been called “designer
solvents” because their physicochemical properties can be tailored
by appropriate selection of the cations and anions.9 ILs have been shown to dissolve starch from different sources10 with the ability to disrupt hydrogen bonds in
polysaccharide molecules, which is considered the main factor for
their dissolution efficacy.11,12 Carboxylate-based ILs
are seen as more promising in green chemistry than commonly used chloride-containing
ILs due to desirable properties of low toxicity, low corrosiveness,
favorable enzyme-compatibility, and biodegradability.13−15

Over the past few years, the use of ILs in dissolution, modification,
and plasticization of starch has received considerable attention.16,17 Although starch can be dissolved in pure ILs, high-energy input
is still required to achieve complete dissolution mainly due to the
high viscosity of pure ILs.18 Hence, developing
milder conditions for starch dissolution is of great importance for
green and sustainable industrial applications of starch. Recently,
the use of water/IL mixtures for starch dissolution at ambient temperature
has attracted considerable interest. For example, maize starch was
completely dissolved in mixtures of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate
([Emim][OAc]) and water at 28 °C19 and 1-ethyl- or propyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Emim][Cl]
or [Pmim][Cl]) and water at 22–23 °C.20 However, in another study, a mixture of 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium
chloride ([Amim][Cl]) and water only partially dissolved maize starch
at 25 °C.5 Studies using undiluted
ILs have shown the anionic moiety of the IL to have an important role
in the dissolution of nonstarch polysaccharides.9,21,22 However, there are few reports that compare
the effect of different anions in undiluted ILs or water/IL mixtures
on the dissolution behavior of starch.

In our previous work,
the effect of alkyl chain length of cations
in undiluted or water/IL mixtures on the dissolution behavior of maize
starch was studied at ambient temperature.20 The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the
anion moiety of ILs and water/IL ratio on the dissolution behavior
of maize starch. To better understand the dissolution progression,
the changes of multiscale structures of maize starch before and after
treatment in different water/IL mixtures were characterized, as was
the effect of the viscosity of water/IL mixtures.

Results and Discussion
Dissolution
of Starch in Different Water/IL Mixtures
The extent of starch
dissolution in water/[C2mim][Cl]
and water/[C2mim][HCOO] mixtures increased with decreasing
water/IL ratio. No undissolved starch was observed in these two mixtures
at a water/IL ratio of 2:1 (Figure 2), indicating that the starch was completely
dissolved. In contrast, no undissolved starch was observed in the
5:1 water/[C2mim][CH3COO] mixture, whereas in
other two mixtures of 10:1 and 2:1, starch granules were still visible
clearly. This indicated that the starch was completely dissolved in
water/[C2mim][CH3COO] mixture of 5:1, but not
in the 10:1 and 2:1 mixtures (Figure 2).

Long-Range Crystalline
Structure of Starch
The X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns and relative crystallinity of native starch
and starch samples after treatment with water/IL mixtures are presented
in Figure 3 and Table 1, respectively. Native
maize starch displayed a typical A-type diffraction pattern, with
relative crystallinity of 28.5%. After treatment with water/[C2mim][Cl] and water/[C2mim][HCOO] mixtures, the
main diffraction peaks of starch crystallites gradually became weaker
and then disappeared as the water/IL ratio decreased from 10:1 to
2:1. Interestingly, the starch treated with water/[C2mim][CH3COO] mixture did not show a similar trend. Starch showed an
amorphous XRD pattern after treatment with water/[C2mim][CH3COO] mixture of 5:1 (Figure 3), but some crystallinity, albeit a lower value, was
still evident after treatment with water/[C2mim][CH3COO] mixtures of 10:1 (10.7%) and 2:1 (20.9%). Thus, at water/IL
ratios of 10:1 and 5:1, the extent of disruption of starch crystallinity
followed the order [C2mim][CH3COO] > [C2mim][HCOO] > [C2mim][Cl], whereas at a water/IL
ratio of 2:1, no crystallinity was detected in starch treated with
water/[C2mim][Cl] and water/[C2mim][HCOO] mixtures,
but crystallinity was still present in starch after treatment with
water/[C2mim][CH3COO] mixture (Figure 3).

Thermal Properties
of Starch
Native starch presented
a large endothermic transition of gelatinization in the temperature
range of 65.1–76.2 °C, with the ΔH value of 13.0 J/g (Figure 4, Table 1).
After treatment of the starch with water/[C2mim][Cl] and
water/[C2mim][HCOO] mixtures, the ΔH values decreased as the water/IL ratio decreased. At water/IL ratios
of 10:1 and 5:1, the decrease in ΔH values
followed the order [C2mim][CH3COO] < [C2mim][HCOO] < [C2mim][Cl] (Table 1). No enthalpy change was detected after
treatment of starch with 2:1 mixtures of water/[C2mim][Cl]
and water/[C2mim][HCOO], whereas a substantial enthalpy
change of 5.8 J/g was observed for starch treated with the 2:1 water/[C2mim][CH3COO] mixture. These observations were in
line with the changes in relative crystallinity measured with XRD.

scan calorimetry thermograms of native starch and
starch samples after treatment with different water/IL mixtures.

Short-Range Ordered Structure of Starch
The LCM-Raman
spectra were obtained to characterize the short-range molecular order
of native starch and starch after treatment with water/IL mixtures
(Figure 5). Increases
in the values of full width at half maximum (fwhm) of the band at
480 cm–1 were used to assess the extent of disruption
of the short-range ordered structure in starch (Table 1). The fwhm for native starch was 16.1; this
value increased for starch treated with water/IL mixtures, indicating
increasing disruption of the short-range order of the molecular structure.
For the ILs containing chloride and formate, the highest value of
fwhm and hence greatest degree of structural disruption occurred with
the 2:1 water/IL mixtures (Table 1). However, water/[C2mim][CH3COO] mixtures disrupted the short-range structural order of the starch
to the greatest extent at a ratio of 5:1, with disruption caused by
the 2:1 mixture being significantly less (Table 1).

samples after treatment
with different water/IL mixtures.

Morphology of Starch Granules
The LM and scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images of native starch and starch samples after
treatment with water/IL mixtures are shown in Figure 6. Under polarized light, starch granules
showed clear “Maltese cross” patterns (Figure 6a-1), whereas SEM showed both
angular and spherical-shaped granules (Figure 6a-2). After treatment with water/[C2mim][Cl] and water/[C2mim][HCOO] mixtures, the granular
morphology and “Maltese cross” patterns became increasingly
blurred with the decreasing water/IL ratio. However, granule morphology
of starch treated with water/[C2mim][CH3COO]
mixture of 5:1 was disrupted more than starch treated with the 10:1
and 2:1 mixtures. When the “Maltese cross” patterns
disappeared, no intact granules were observed for starch treated with
2:1 water/[C2mim][Cl] mixture (Figure 6d-2). However, the granule contours were
still visible for the starch treated with 2:1 water/[C2mim][HCOO] and 5:1 water/[C2mim][CH3COO] mixture
(Figure 6g-2,i-2).

Rheological Properties of Water/IL Mixtures
The steady
state viscosity of water and water/IL mixtures is shown in Figure 7. Viscosity of water/IL
mixtures increased with decreasing water/IL ratio, such that the viscosity
of 2:1 water/IL mixtures was 2–3 times that of the corresponding
5:1 mixtures and 4–7 times that of the corresponding 10:1 mixtures.
At the same water/IL molar ratio, the viscosity of the mixtures followed
the order [C2mim][CH3COO] > [C2mim][Cl]
> [C2mim][HCOO].

ratios of water/IL.

General Discussion
In the present study, the effect
of the anionic moiety of ILs and water/IL ratio on the dissolution
behavior of maize starch was investigated by analyzing multiscale
structural changes due to treatment with different water/IL mixtures.
The extent of starch dissolution by the water/IL mixtures was shown
to be consistent with the degree of starch structural disruption.
Our hypothesis to explain the dissolution behavior of starch in different
water/IL mixtures is based on the capacity of the anion of the IL
to form hydrogen bonds and the viscosity of the water/IL mixtures.
At low concentration of ILs, the water/IL mixtures have sufficiently
low viscosity to favor the ILs to penetrate into granules and disrupt
hydrogen bonds in starch. With increasing concentration of ILs in
the mixtures, the extent of dissolution increased due to more ILs
breaking a larger amount of hydrogen bonds in starch granules. However,
the reduced extent of starch dissolution in water/[C2mim][CH3COO] mixtures of 2:1 is proposed to be due to the high viscosity
of this mixture impeding the penetration of ILs into granules.20

At water/IL molar ratios of 10:1 and 5:1,
the extent of starch dissolution followed the order [C2mim][CH3COO] > [C2mim][HCOO] > [C2mim][Cl], consistent with the order of hydrogen bonding capacity
of anions [CH3COO]− > [HCOO]− > [Cl]−.14,23 The greater hydrogen
bonding capacity made the anions interact more readily with the hydroxyl
groups of starch molecules to disrupt the ordered structure of granules.
At low water/IL ratio (2:1), the high viscosity of water/[C2mim][CH3COO] mixture resulted in the slower penetration
of the IL into starch granules, lowering the extent of disruption
of starch structure.

Conclusions
Both the anionic moiety
and water/IL ratios influenced the dissolution
behavior of maize starch. The short- and long-range ordered structures
in the starch were disrupted increasingly with decreasing water/IL
ratio of water/[C2mim][Cl] and water/[C2mim][HCOO]
mixtures. However, in water/[C2mim][CH3COO]
mixtures, the greatest disruption of the starch structure occurred
in the 5:1 mixture rather than in the 2:1 mixture. Maize starch was
completely dissolved at ambient temperature in a 5:1 water/[C2mim][CH3COO] mixture and in 2:1 mixtures of water/[C2mim][HCOO] and water/[C2mim][Cl]. The hydrogen
bonding capacity of the IL anions and viscosity of the water/IL mixtures
were proposed to account for the differences in starch dissolution
behavior. At high water/IL molar ratios, the hydrogen bonding capacity
of the IL anions play a major role in starch dissolution, whereas
the viscosity of the water/IL mixtures dominates starch dissolution
at low water/IL ratio. These findings indicate that the dissolution
ability of ILs for natural biopolymers can be modulated by selecting
the anionic moiety and water/IL ratio.

Experimental Section
Materials
Maize starch (MS, 10.1% moisture and 22.4%
amylose content) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St.
Louis, MO, USA). The ILs (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, [C2mim][Cl]; 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium formate, [C2mim][HCOO]; 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate, [C2mim][CH3COO]) were bought from Nuowei Chemistry Co., Ltd. (Wuhu, Anhui,
China) with purities ≥95% (water contents <5000 ppm). The
chemical structures of ILs used are listed in Figure 1. Milli-Q water was used in all instances.

Starch Treatment in Water/IL Mixtures
Water/IL mixtures
at different molar ratios (10:1, 5:1, and 2:1) were prepared, and
the treatment of maize starch in the different mixtures was as reported
elsewhere.20 Starch samples after treatment
were stored in a desiccator before structural analysis. The abbreviation
(water/IL-m/n-MS) is used subsequently
to indicate maize starch that was treated with mixtures of molar ratios
of m water/n IL.

Long-Range
Crystallinity of Starch
The crystallinity
of starch samples was determined using an X-ray diffractometer (D8
ADVANCE, Bruker, Germany) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. The samples
were equilibrated over a saturated NaCl solution at room temperature
for 3 days before measurement. The moisture-equilibrated samples were
scanned over the range of 5° to 35° (2θ) at a rate
of 2 °/min and a step size of 0.02°. The relative crystallinity
was calculated using the software of DIFFRAC EVA (Version 3.0, Bruker,
Germany).24

Thermal Properties of Starch
Thermal properties of
the starch samples were measured using a differential scanning calorimeter
(200 F3, Netzsch, Germany) equipped with a thermal analysis data station.
Approximately 3 mg of starch samples were weighed accurately into
aluminum pans, and Milli-Q water was added to obtain a starch/water
ratio of 1/3 (w/v).25 The pans were sealed
and allowed to stand for 6 h at room temperature before analysis.
The samples were heated from 20 to 100 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min.
An empty aluminum pan was used as the reference. The onset (To), peak (Tp), conclusion
(Tc) temperatures, and enthalpy of gelatinization
(ΔH) were obtained through a data recording
software.

Short-Range Molecular Order of Starch
The short-range
molecular order of the starch samples was determined using Renishaw
inVia Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw, Gloucestershire, United Kingdom)
equipped with a Leica microscope (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany).
A 785 nm green diode laser source was used. Spectra in the range of
3200–100 cm–1 were obtained with a resolution
of approximately 7 cm–1.24 The fwhm of the band at 480 cm–1 was used to characterize
the short-range molecular order of starch using the software of Wire
2.0.

Morphology of Starch
Morphology of the starch samples
was observed using a light microscope (DM-4000M-LED, Leica, Germany)
and a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SU-1510, Hitachi,
Japan). For light microscopy, one drop of a 0.5% starch suspension
was applied onto a glass slide and covered with a coverslip.15 Starch samples were imaged under polarized light
modes at room temperature.

For SEM, starch samples were mounted
on a stub with double-sided adhesive tape, sputter-coated with gold
before imaging. An accelerating voltage of 5 kV was used.

Rheology Properties
of Water/IL Mixtures
Rheological
measurements of water/IL mixtures were performed in an Anton Paar
MCR302 rheometer (Anton Paar GmbH, Austria) with a Peltier temperature
control system. The measuring system had cone-plate geometry with
a diameter of 40 mm and cone angle of 4°. For each mixture, the
steady-state viscosity was recorded as a function of shear rate from
10 to 500 s–1 at constant temperature (23 °C).26 Silicone oil was placed around the edge of the
measuring cell to prevent water evaporation.

Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed at
least in triplicate, and the results are reported as mean values and
standard deviations. In the case of XRD, only one measurement was
performed. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc
Duncan’s multiple range tests (p < 0.05)
was conducted to determine the significant differences between mean
values using the SPSS 17.0 Statistical Software Program (SPSS Inc.
Chicago, IL, USA).27
