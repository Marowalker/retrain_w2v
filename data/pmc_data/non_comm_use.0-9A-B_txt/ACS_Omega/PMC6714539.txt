This paper describes the synthesis
of a discrete unit of hominal
bis(gem-CF2). The controlled introduction
of fluorine atoms is a powerful synthetic tool to introduce dipole
moments with minimal impact to sterics. Poly(vinylidene difluoride)
is a striking example of the influence of fluorine atoms, which impart
ferroelectric behavior from the alignment of the dipole moments of
CF2 units; however, it is prepared via direct polymerization
of vinylidene difluoride. Thus, a different synthetic pathway is required
to produce synthons containing discrete numbers of CF2 groups
in a hominal relation to each other. We found out that, in the case
of short chains, the consecutive deoxofluorination of sequentially
introduced keto groups is inefficient, as it requires harsh conditions
and decreasing yields at each step. To solve this problem, we combined
the selective desulfurative fluorination of dithiolanes with pyridinium
fluoride and the deoxofluorination of keto groups with morpholinosulfur
trifluoride. This strategy is highly reproducible and scalable, allowing
the synthesis of the hominal bis(gem-CF2) fragment as a shelf-stable tosylate, which can be used to install
discrete chains of hominal bis(gem-CF2) on a variety of synthons and monomers.

Introduction
The introduction of
fluorine atoms into organic compounds has established
itself as a powerful tool for tuning their chemical and physical properties
with minimal impact to sterics. Fluorination often improves chemical
resistance, thermal stability, and biological and optical activities.1 As a result, C–F bonds can be found in
a wide variety of pharmaceuticals,2,3 agrochemicals,
pesticides, surfactants, dyes, and polymeric materials.4,5

The unique properties of the fluorine atom have drawn increasing
attention to its potential application in the field of organic photovoltaics
(OPV), where the introduction of C–F bonds into the monomers
of conjugated polymers can significantly improve their performance.6,7 The systematic introduction of C–F bonds into the backbones
of benzoditiophene-8,9 and thiophene-containing10−13 conjugated (co)polymers leads to an increase in power conversion
efficiencies (PCEs) through a combination of subtle effects.6 The utility of this approach is evident in the
recent work of Zhao et al., where the combination of a fluorinated
donor and nonfullerene acceptors enabled OPV devices with PCEs over
13%.14 In addition to direct backbone fluorination,
several studies have examined the effects of introducing fluorinated
pendant groups of semifluorinated alkyl chains.15,16 Such modifications lead to favorable microstructural ordering and
remarkably high electron mobilities. There is a growing focus on the
electrostatics of pendant groups (i.e., permanent dipoles) in organic
materials, from enhancing the dielectric constant of OPV materials17,18 to stabilizing dopants in thermoelectrics.19 A striking manifestation of the strong dipole moment created by
C–F bonds is ferroelectricity in poly(vinylidene difluoride),
which arises from the alignment of CF2 groups enabled by
the −CH2CF2– repeat-unit.20−23

We are interested in synthesizing discrete chains containing
these
hominal bis(gem-CF2) (i.e., CF2CH2CF224) units
that can be attached to small molecules and monomers to tailor their
electrostatic properties; however, the synthesis of hominal CF2 units, in general, has not been widely reported. Typically,
such compounds are obtained in the mixture of telomers, as illustrated
in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Background
for this study: telomerization approach.

Hauptschein et al. accomplished the telomerization of 1,1-difluoroethylene
under thermal conditions, yielding telomer iodides and bromides containing
the hominal bis(gem-CF2) fragment.25 In later work, they prepared fluorocarbon halosulfates,
acids, and derivatives that also contained such units.26 However, in both cases, the hominal bis(gem-CF2) fragment formed in a mixture with perfluorinated
moieties. The synthesis also required large autoclaves, long and extensive
heating, and difficult fractional distillations for isolation. Similar
difficulties were observed by others, via a variety of synthetic approaches:
photochemically initiated reactions of bistrifluoromethyl disulfide
with olefins,27 thermal polymerization
of SF5Br with fluoroolefins,28 modification of other telomers,29 and
telomerization of vinylidene difluoride with α,ω-diiodoperfluoroalkanes30 and iodoperfluoroalkanes.31−35

It is apparently impossible to control the
number of CH2CF2 units by means of telomerization;
a fully synthetic
and controllable approach that does not require harsh conditions,
can be performed in a typical laboratory environment, and easily reproduced
would be ideal. An overview of such efforts is depicted in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Background for this study:
synthetic approaches.

Stepanov et al. demonstrated
one of the first examples of synthetically
feasible compounds containing a hominal bis(gem-CF2) fragment.36 By treating pentane-2,4-dione
with SF4 for 3 h at 20 °C, they managed to obtain
a mixture that contained 8% of 2,2,4,4-tetrafluoropentane and 70%
of 4,4-difluoropentan-2-one among other fluorinated products. With
increased reaction time (up to 40 h) and the addition of hydrogen
fluoride (HF), they observed a shift toward the formation of 2,2,4,4-tetrafluoropentane
as a predominant product. The same behavior was observed in the case
of 2,2,4,4-tetrafluorohexane from hexane-2,4-dione. Even though this
approach seems straightforward, reacting SF4 and HF in
an autoclave is so dangerous as to be forbidden in many (academic)
laboratories (such as our own). As a result, more convenient and user-friendly
methods of introducing CF2 groups have been developed,37 largely as a class of dialkylaminosulfur tetrafluorides38 and pyridinium poly(hydrogen fluoride) (PPHF:
70% hydrogen fluoride, 30% pyridine, also known as Olah reagent).39

Significant progress toward the user-friendly
synthesis of hominal
bis(gem-CF2)-containing compounds using
these methods has been done by O’Hagan and co-workers. For
example, Wang et al. installed CF2 groups into a palmitic
acid analogue by sequential preparation of appropriate precursor ketones,
followed by deoxofluorination using diethylaminosulfur trifluoride
(DAST).40 The conversion to the CF2 group occurred in modest yields and required neat DAST at
elevated temperature. Jones et al. synthesized 2,2-dimethyl-5-phenyl-1,1,3,3-tetrafluorocyclohexane
by means of the direct deoxofluorination of a diketone precursor.41 Attempts to use the same approach in the case
of diketones, which did not have dimethyl-substituted methylene between
keto groups, were unsuccessful, yielding only complex and intractable
products, which could be attributed to the high degree of enolization
of such diketones. This behavior of diketones was also noted previously
in the work by Singh et al.42 In both works
by Stepanov et al.36 and Wang et al.,40 the route to compounds containing the hominal
bis(gem-CF2) fragment included the formation
of 3,3-difluoroketones as intermediates. 3,3-Difluoroketones themselves
are attractive building blocks but are difficult to synthesize; however,
recent work by Hamel et al. demonstrated the synthesis of 3,3-difluoroketones
via a regioselective gold-catalyzed formal hydration of propargylic
gem-difluorides.43

Given the relative
scarcity of examples of the successful isolation
of compounds containing hominal bis(gem-CF2) units, there does not appear to be any reasonable synthetic route
to realize our goal of incorporating them into pendant chains. In
this work, we demonstrate an approachable, reproducible, and reliable
strategy for synthesizing compounds containing the hominal bis(gem-CF2) fragment from the precursor 3,3-difluoroketones.
Our strategy is scalable and produces shelf-stable tosylate that can,
in principle, be used to introduce hominal bis(gem-CF2) units into any small molecule or monomer.

Results
and Discussion
In our first attempts to synthesize a hominal
bis(gem-CF2) fragment, we used a consecutive
deoxofluorination
approach analogous to that proposed by Wang et al.,40 as illustrated in Scheme 1. Starting from commercially available allyl benzyl
ether (1), we performed an epoxidation using meta-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA), which
gave 2 in high yield (77%). This reaction was followed
by chain extension with vinylmagnesium bromide and CuCN to produce
alcohol 3 in near-quantitative yield (99%), which was
oxidized with Dess–Martin periodinane (DMP), leading to the
suitable ketone 4 (80% yield). This ketone was then treated
with morpholinosulfur trifluoride (Morph-DAST) to introduce the CF2 group, yielding compound 5. The deoxofluorination
reaction proceeded under mild conditions, requiring 24 h in CH2Cl2 at room temperature to achieve a high yield
(91%). Morph-DAST was used as our deoxofluorination reagent of choice,
as its reactivity was previously reported to be identical to superior
over DAST, while possessing higher thermal stability, producing less
fumes in laboratory air, and thus being safer to handle.44−46 To generate the second ketone precursor, compound 5 was epoxidized (mCPBA, 95%). The resulting epoxide 6 was reduced with LiAlH4, giving alcohol 7 (99%), which was oxidized with DMP, yielding ketone 8 (76%). Compounds 2, 3, 6, and 7 possess chiral carbon atoms, which lead to obtaining
a mixture of stereoisomers of these compounds. However, we carried
these compounds through the synthesis, as the stereocenter disappeared
when generating the corresponding ketones 4 and 8. Our attempts to introduce the second CF2 group
by means of deoxofluorination were met with moderate success. Performing
the reaction with neat Morph-DAST at 50 °C for 3 days produced
a crude product containing compound 9 in poor (9%) yield.
Efforts to isolate a completely pure product were unsuccessful.

Scheme 1 Consecutive Deoxofluorinations
The low efficiency of the second deoxofluorination step highlights
the difficulty in synthesizing the hominal bis(gem-CF2) fragment; the installation of each CF2 severely deactivates subsequent deoxofluorination reactions, precluding
the isolation of more than one CH2CF2 unit.
In this case, we obtained the product 9 in poor yield.
We suspect that the key difference between our work and that of Wang
et al.40 can be attributed to the difference
in a keto group environment. Although both contain CF2 groups
in a hominal arrangement, substrate 8 does not possess
the long aliphatic chain that is present in palmitic acid, the electron-donating
nature of which may have somewhat counteracted the deactivating effect
of the first CF2 group.

To cope with the apparent
narrow scope of the aforementioned consecutive
deoxofluorination approach, we decided to change our synthetic strategy,
as demonstrated in Scheme 2. First, we reacted previously synthesized epoxide 2 with the ethylenediamine complex of lithium acetylide to introduce
the propargyl group, yielding alcohol 10 (94%). This
compound was then treated with potassium tert-butoxide, to effect
the migration of a triple bond, as was demonstrated before by Kadirvel
et al.47 and Li et al.,48 resulting in the propynyl 11 (88% yield),
which was then oxidized with DMP49 to produce
yneone 12 (72% yield). Generating the yneone fragment
is a key step, as it was easily converted into β-dithiolane 13 in high yield (89%) using the procedure by Sneddon et al.50 The dithiolane (thioketal) group acts as an
orthogonal protecting group of a parent 1,3-diketone, which simultaneously
permits the use of drastically different fluorination techniques on
both reaction centers. Using this strategy, we proceeded with desulfurative
fluorination of the dithiolane group in 13 with PPHF
and 1,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (DBDMH) following the procedure
by Sondej and Katzenellenbogen,51 which
resulted in fluorinated product 14. Because of the use
of DBDMH as a source of electrophilic Br+, during this
transformation, the benzyl protecting group was partially brominated.
The degree of bromination varied depending on the reaction time and
scale; however, it was always significant. The mixture of brominated
product 14 and its nonbrominated analogue (58% combined
yield after desulfurative fluorination of 13) was difficult
to separate by means of chromatography. However, both compounds demonstrated
equal reactivity and were carried through the rest of the synthesis
without incident. The second ketone group was then converted into
the CF2 group via deoxofluorination with Morph-DAST under
very mild conditions (overnight in CH2Cl2),
yielding the product 15 in a good yield (85%). One might
consider such a smooth transformation to be surprising when taking
into account how troublesome was the deoxofluorination of ketone 8. Indeed, both ketones 8 and 14 have CF2 groups in a hominal position, which seemingly
deactivates deoxofluorination of 8 but does not have
major effect on reactivity of 14. This might be due to
the electron-donating effect of the adjacent ether moiety, and we
will try to illuminate this phenomenon in our follow-up work.

Scheme 2 Combined Desulfurative- and Deoxofluorination Approach with Benzyl
Protection
To generate alcohol 16, we cleaved the (bromo-)benzyl
protecting group of compound 15 with hydrogen gas in
an autoclave at 30 bar using palladium on carbon as a catalyst and
methanol as a solvent. The deprotection proceeded a bit more slowly
than anticipated because the bromines needed to be reduced (forming 9 in situ) before the normal benzyl ether deprotection reaction
occurred. Unfortunately, alcohol 16 is extremely volatile,
which required some care following the autoclave step; once the autoclave
cooled, compound 16 was collected as a cold, methanolic
solution and immediately worked up with dichloromethane, without evaporating
the solvent. This handling limited the characterization of alcohol 16, which we could verify by NMR but could not isolate. Instead,
the resulting crude dichloromethane solution was quickly tosylated,
giving the product 17 along with methyl tosylate from
the residual methanol from the autoclave mixture. After purification
via flash column chromatography, we isolated pure tosylate 17, which is shelf-stable and considerably less volatile than 16. As the quantity of alcohol 16 could not be
determined accurately (we could only verify full conversion according
to 19F NMR), the exact yield of last two steps cannot be
reported. However, it is possible to determine the yield of the two-step
transformation from compound 15 into the final product 17, which is 30.7%. We assume that the yield loss is due partly
to the (extreme) volatility of the alcohol 16 in addition
to the yield of the tosylation reaction itself. To effect the tosylation,
we treated the cold crude solution containing 16 and
trace amounts of methanol with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO)
as a base, along with the catalytic quantity of 4-dimethylaminopyridine
(DMAP), followed by the excess amount of 4-toluenesulfonyl chloride.
This allowed us to obtain and purify the product 17;
however, while using other procedures (e.g., with NaOH, pyridine,
or triethylamine as a base and without DMAP), we either observed very
low yields or could not separate the product 17 from
the resulting mixture.

To avoid the necessity of using an autoclave
and all of the difficulties
it created, we investigated the applicability of our strategy to a
different substrate, namely, to methoxyacetic acid (18). This approach is illustrated in Scheme 3. We started by converting 18 into a Weinreb amide 20 in a two-step process via an
intermediate acyl chloride 19 (around 72% two-step yield).
The amide 20 was then reacted with 1-propynylmagnesium
bromide, yielding the compound 21 (89%). This synthesis
was previously reported by Globisch et al.52 and allowed us to shorten the number of steps, leading to the necessary
yneone moiety, which was then treated in a manner similar to that
mentioned above. After easily converting it to dithiolane 22 (95% yield), we treated the product with PPHF and DBDMH, resulting
in fluorinated compound 23 (67% yield). Although this
approach obviates the need for the autoclave and eliminates the bromination
of the benzyl protecting group, the intermediates were considerably
more volatile, which required care (e.g., when evaporating solvents
and storing intermediates between steps) until the final product 17 was isolated. Thus, after producing the compound 23 and deoxofluorinating it with Morph-DAST, we were able
to obtain product 24 (74% yield). What followed was the
demethylation using iodotrimethylsilane in accordance with Jung et
al.,53 which yielded the aforementioned
compound 16 (full conversion by 19F NMR, exact
yield could not be determined). Alcohol 16 was promptly
tosylated to afford compound 17. The yield of the two-step
transformation from compound 24 into the final product 17 was around 19%, which is lower than for the transformation
of 15. Despite shortening of the synthetic route, this
modified strategy proceeded with mixed success, as coping with the
volatility of not only the alcohol 16 but also compounds 23–24 turned out to be challenging.

Scheme 3 Combined Desulfurative- and Deoxofluorination Approach with Methyl
Protection
Conclusions
We
explored three approaches leading to easy-to-handle and shelf-stable
compounds containing a hominal bis(gem-CF2) fragment. While the general strategy involving two consecutive
deoxofluorinations of ketones has been demonstrated,40 it turns out to be quite specific to 1,3-diketones flanked
by long alkyl chains. Excluding deprotection, adopting that strategy
to our target compound required 8 steps, but failed at last deoxofluorination
due to the apparent deactivation of the second deoxofluorination by
the first CF2. To work around this problem and expand the
scope of the double difluorination of 1,3-diketones, we combined desulfurative-
and deoxofluorinations to obtain the hominal bis(gem-CF2) fragment in good yield in six to seven steps, depending
on the protecting group used (e.g., compounds 15 and 24). The possibility of deoxofluorination of ketones 14 and 23 in the presence of CF2 groups
at the hominal position might be attributed to the influence of the
adjacent ether moiety and will be further explored in our upcoming
work. While the use of a methyl protective group allowed us to shorten
the number of steps and avoid the use of an autoclave, it necessitated
working with volatile intermediates. Deprotection of both compounds 15 and 24 followed by the tosylation of intermediate
alcohol 16 allows the isolation of the hominal bis(gem-CF2) fragment in the form of product 17, which can be attached to small molecules and monomers
to introduce strong dipole moments in the 1,3 configuration that enables
their alignment in an electric field. We believe that such modifications
will be useful for affecting the dielectric and molecular doping properties
of organic electronic materials.

In the course of synthesizing 17, we isolated the
3,3-difluoroketones 8, 14, and 23, which are potentially useful building blocks for a variety of applications.43 By combining deoxofluorination and desulfurative
fluorination strategies, we installed the hominal bis(gem-CF2) fragment in the presence of the ketone rather than
hydrating a propargylic gem-difluoride to form a
ketone. Thus, our synthetic strategy expands the scope of the double
difluorination of 1,3-diketones and provides an alternative route
to the synthesis of 3,3-difluoroketones using accessible and scalable
chemistry.

Synthesis
General Procedure for Epoxidation
To a stirring solution
of an appropriate alkene (1.0 equiv) in CH2Cl2 (volume in milliliter (mL) equal to the millimoles (mmol) of alkene)
at room temperature and ambient conditions, a solution of mCPBA (2.5 equiv) in CH2Cl2 (volume
in mL equals twice the number of mmol of mCPBA) was
added. The mixture was left stirring overnight. The resulting mixture
was filtered to get rid of formed suspension, and the organic layer
was washed successively with aqueous solutions of NaHSO3, NaHCO3, water, and brine, filtering away any formed
intermediate precipitate. The combined organic layer was dried over
Na2SO4 and filtered, and the solvent was removed
by rotary evaporation. The resulting product is used without further
purification in the next step, unless necessary.

General Procedure
for Oxidation of Alcohols
To a 0.3
M solution of an appropriate alcohol (1.0 equiv) in CH2Cl2 at 0 °C and in the ambient atmosphere was slowly
added Dess–Martin periodinane (DMP) (1.5 equiv), and the resulting
mixture was left warming up to room temperature and stirring overnight.
The resulting mixture was filtered to get rid of the formed suspension;
then, the organic layer was quenched with water and washed with an
aqueous saturated NaHSO3 solution and then with a saturated
NaHCO3 solution, water, and brine. The combined organic
layers were dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated
in vacuo. The resulting product is used without further purification
in the next step, unless necessary.

General Procedure for Dithiolane
Formation
This procedure
is adapted from the one previously reported by Sneddon et al.50 Sodium methoxide (5.4 M solution in methanol,
1.3 equiv) was added in one portion to a stirred solution of an appropriate
ynone (1 equiv) and ethane-1,2-dithiol (1.1 equiv) in methanol and
CH2Cl2 (4:1, 0.05 M) at approximately −10
°C. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight, allowing the
temperature to rise to ambient temperature. On completion, the reaction
was quenched by addition of saturated NH4Cl solution and
extracted with diethyl ether. The organic fractions were washed with
water and brine, dried over Na2SO4, concentrated
under reduced pressure, and purified by flash chromatography if necessary.

General Procedure for Deoxofluorination of Ketones
To a
0.5 M solution of an appropriate ketone (1.0 equiv) in CH2Cl2 (usually 0.5 M, although molarity might vary
and is not a crucial parameter) under an inert atmosphere at 0 °C,
Morph-DAST (2.2 equiv) was slowly added. The reaction mixture was
allowed to gradually warm up to room temperature and left stirring
overnight. Then, it was diluted with additional CH2Cl2 and poured dropwise on the stirring mixture of saturated
aqueous NaHCO3 and ice. When effervescence was complete,
the organic layer was washed with a saturated NaHCO3 solution
(until the solution became constantly basic), water, and brine. The
organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated
in vacuo. The resulting crude product was purified using vacuum distillation
or column chromatography.

General Procedure for Desulfurative Fluorination
of Dithiolanes
A flame-dried three-necked round-bottom borosilicate
glass flask,
capped with septums, and connected to the Schlenk line, was charged
with DBDMH (2.0 equiv) and put under an inert atmosphere. Then, DBDMH
was fully dissolved in dry CH2Cl2 (approximately
30 mL of CH2Cl2 is needed per gram of DBDMH).
The mixture was cooled to −78 °C, and PPHF (approximately
1.5 mL/mmol of dithiolane is used) was added via a syringe, making
sure that the temperature remains constant. This mixture was stirred
for 30 min at −78 °C, followed by the dropwise addition
of an appropriate dithiolane (1.0 equiv). The resulting mixture was
stirred at a constant temperature of −78 °C for an additional
45 min. It was then carefully poured via a Teflon cannula on the mechanically
stirred icy solution of NaHCO3 in the high-density polyethylene
vessel, without letting the reaction mixture to warm up. When effervescence
was complete and the solution became constantly basic, it was extracted
with CH2Cl2; washed with saturated CuSO4, water, and brine; dried over Na2SO4; and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting crude product was dissolved
in a small quantity of CH2Cl2 and filtered through
silica. Further purification was performed if necessary.

2,2,4,4-Tetrafluoropentan-1-ol (16)
Solution
of 15 (0.43 g, 1.31 mmol) in methanol (10 mL) together
with 10% palladium on carbon (0.14 g, 0.131 mmol) and few drops of
HCl were mixed in an autoclave. The system was closed and left stirring
in the hydrogen atmosphere at 30 bar pressure for 24 h. Afterward,
the autoclave was cooled with ice and the cold solution was dissolved
in CH2Cl2 (50 mL), filtered through silica,
then promptly washed with cold water and brine, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo (without putting
pressure below 800 mbar, to avoid losses of alcohol due to its volatility).
Then, 2.72 g of crude solution of 16 was obtained in
CH2Cl2 and methanol. The full conversion of 15 to 16 was confirmed by 19F NMR,
and to avoid further loss of the product, the crude solution was promptly
used in the next step without further purification. For calculations,
the quantity of alcohol 16 was used as if the yield is
99% (0.2 g, 1.249 mmol). 1H NMR (400 MHz, chloroform-d) δ 3.82 (t, J = 13.0 Hz, 2H), 2.61

To a stirred solution
of crude 16 (0.20 g,
1.249 mmol) from the previous step were added N,N-dimethylpyridin-4-amine (DMAP, 0.015 g, 0.125 mmol) and
DABCO (0.28 g, 2.498 mmol) at 0 °C in CH2Cl2 (2.5 mL), followed by 4-methylbenzene-1-sulfonyl chloride (0.29
g, 1.56 mmol), and the resulting solution was sealed and left warming
up to room temperature and stirring overnight. Then, it was washed
with water, 1 N HCl, NaHCO3, 1 N KOH, and brine; dried;
and concentrated. The resulting crude product was purified using flash
chromatography (silica gel, hexane/ethyl acetate gradient separation),
affording compound 17 (0.126 g, 0.40 mmol) as a transparent
yellowish oil. 1H NMR (400 MHz, chloroform-d) δ 7.86–7.75 (m, 2H), 7.37 (d, J =

As the quantity
of alcohol 16 could not be determined accurately, the
exact yield of last two steps cannot be reported. However, it is possible
to determine the yield of the two-step transformation from compound 15 (0.43 g, 1.306 mmol) into the final product 17 (0.126 g, 0.401 mmol), which is 30.7%.

We assume that the
yield loss is due to the volatility of the alcohol 16 and the specific tosylation procedure. When applied for
other substrates (e.g., 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethanol), the average yield
of this tosylation procedure is 60%, which means an approximate yield
of 51% after an autoclave. Interestingly, the use of other procedures
for tosylation of alcohols (e.g., with NaOH, pyridine, or triethylamine
as a base and without DMAP) did not allow us to separate the pure
product 17.

2-Methoxyacetyl Chloride (19)
This procedure
is adapted from the one previously reported by Globisch et al.52 Dimethylformamide (20 μL, catalytic amount)
and oxalyl chloride (66.7 mL, 762 mmol) were added to a solution of
2-methoxyacetic acid (45 mL, 586 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (300 mL) at 0 °C under an inert atmosphere, and the solution
was stirred for 3 h. The solvent was removed in vacuo to give 19 (60.00 g, 553 mmol, 94% yield) as a pale yellow oil, which
was used without further purification.

N,2-Dimethoxy-N-methylacetamide
(20)
This procedure is adapted from the one
previously reported by Globisch et al.52N,O-Dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride
(59.30 g, 608 mmol) and pyridine (98 mL, 1216 mmol) were added to
a crude solution of 19 (60.00 g, 553 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (400 mL) under an inert atmosphere, and the
solution was stirred at room temperature for 18 h before quenching
with saturated NaHCO3; extracting with CH2Cl2; and washing with water, 1 N HCl, and brine. The organic
layer was dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated
in vacuo to give 20 (57.00 g, 428 mmol, 77% yield) as
a transparent colorless liquid. If the product purity is unsatisfactory,
it can be distilled at 43 °C and 727 mTorr. 1H NMR
(400 MHz, chloroform-d) δ 3.84 (s, 2H), 3.34
(s, 3H), 3.07 (s, 3H), 2.81 (s, 3H). See ref (52) for full characterization.

1-Methoxypent-3-yn-2-one (21)
This procedure
is adapted from the one previously reported by Globisch et al.52 To a solution of 20 (20.00 g, 150
mmol) in THF (200 mL) at −78 °C was added 0.5 M THF solution
of prop-1-yn-1-ylmagnesium bromide (451 mL, 225 mmol), and the resulting
mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction was
quenched with aqueous NH4Cl solution (150 mL) and extracted
with ethyl acetate (3 × 70 mL). The combined organic layers were
dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo,
affording compound 21 (15.00 g, 134 mmol, 89% yield)
as a yellowish liquid. If the product purity is unsatisfactory, it
can be distilled at 74 °C and 9.69 Torr. 1H NMR (300
MHz, chloroform-d) δ 4.07 (s, 2H), 3.39 (s,

According to the General
Procedure for Dithiolane Formation, the reaction using sodium
methoxide (18.55 mL of 5.4 M solution in methanol, 93 mmol), 21 (8.00 g, 71.3 mmol), and ethane-1,2-dithiol (7.39 mL, 78
mmol) afforded compound 22 (14.00 g, 67.9 mmol, 95% yield)
as a yellowish liquid, which was used in the next step without further
purification. 1H NMR (300 MHz, chloroform-d) δ 3.96 (s, 2H), 3.36 (s, 3H), 3.34–3.19 (m, 4H), 3.13

to the General Procedure for Desulfurative
Fluorination of Dithiolanes, the reaction using DBDMH (13.86
g, 48.5 mmol), PPHF (45 mL, 499 mmol), and 22 (5.00 g,
24.23 mmol) after distillation of a crude product at 41 °C and
19.8 Torr or filtering the CH2Cl2 solution through
silica afforded compound 23 (2.50 g, 16.43 mmol, 67.8%
yield) as a yellow liquid. Precautions have to be taken when working
with product 23, as the rapid weight loss could be observed
due to its volatility. 1H NMR (400 MHz, chloroform-d) δ 4.06 (s, 2H), 3.43 (s, 3H), 3.04 (t, J = 14.7 Hz, 2H), 1.73 (t, J = 18.9 Hz,

2,2,4,4-Tetrafluoro-1-methoxypentane
(24)
According to the General
Procedure for Deoxofluorination
of Ketones, the reaction using 23 (2.5 g, 16.43
mmol) and Morph-DAST (6.33 g or 4.81 mL, 36.2 mmol) afforded compound 24 (2.14 g, 12.26 mmol, 74.6% yield) as a dark yellow liquid.
If the product purity is unsatisfactory, it can be purified using
column chromatography (CH2Cl2, Rf = 0.84). Precautions have to be taken
when working with product 24, as the rapid weight loss
could be observed due to its volatility. 1H NMR (400 MHz,
chloroform-d) δ 3.60 (t, J = 12.8 Hz, 2H), 3.44 (s, 3H), 2.57 (p, J = 15.4

2,2,4,4-Tetrafluoropentan-1-ol (16)
To
an ice-cold stirred solution of 24 (0.40 g, 2.30 mmol)
in CDCl3 (1.5 mL) in a sealed vessel with a septum cap
under an inert atmosphere, trimethylsilyl iodide (1.15 g, 0.78 mL,
5.74 mmol) was slowly added. The resulting solution was stirred at
room temperature, until the full conversion of 24 to 16 was confirmed by 19F NMR (took 36 h), after
which it was quenched with methanol. The resulting mixture was extracted
with ether and washed with NaHSO3, water, NaHCO3, and brine. Combined organic layers were dried and gently concentrated
(without lowering the pressure below 800 mTorr), affording the crude
solution containing 16. 1H NMR (400 MHz, chloroform-d) δ 3.83 (t, J = 13.0 Hz, 2H), 2.61
(p, J = 15.2 Hz, 2H), 1.73 (t, J = 19.1 Hz, 3H). 13C NMR (75 MHz, chloroform-d) δ too low intensity of the signals. 19F NMR (376
MHz, chloroform-d) δ −85.99 to −86.49
(m), −104.88 to −105.29 (m). Precautions have to be
taken when working with product 16, as the rapid weight
loss could be observed due to its volatility. To avoid further loss
of the product, the crude solution was used without further purification
in a tosylation reaction according to the abovementioned procedure.
The total crude amount (0.34 g, 2.12 mmol, 92% yield) was used for
calculations. As the amount of alcohol 16 could not be
determined accurately, the exact yield of the demethylation step cannot
be reported. However, it is possible to determine the yield of the
two-step transformation from compound 24 (0.40 g, 2.297
mmol) into the final product 17 (0.12 g, 0.764 mmol),
which is 19.88%, and is lower than that determined through the benzyl
protection route.
