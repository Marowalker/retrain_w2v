Although the emphasis of water splitting
is typically on hydrogen
generation, there is a value in the oxygen byproduct especially for
life support in field operations. For such applications, the production
of a pure, unadulterated oxygen stream is highly desired under environmental
conditions. Here, we demonstrate that self-healing oxygen evolution
catalysts composed of cobalt or nickel are capable of selectively
producing oxygen from both 0.5 M NaCl solutions and seawater. Differential
electrochemical mass spectrometry demonstrates the absence of halogen
in the product stream, and chemical analysis shows the production
of only minute amounts of hypohalous acid.

Introduction
The oxygen evolution
reaction (OER), in which water is anodically
converted to oxygen, has unique applications when performed under
environmental conditions. Although OER is often considered as an ancillary
byproduct to the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction for the storage
of renewable energy,1−3 the reaction has great value for the generation of
breathable oxygen from water, especially for extended autonomous human-based
undersea operations.4 For these applications,
it is of interest to generate oxygen directly from seawater5 and, therefore, the effects of seawater on the
long-term stability of the catalyst and the selective generation of
oxygen become important considerations. Oxygen production from seawater
is particularly challenging because the halide salts present in seawater
potentially introduce undesirable oxidation products, most notably
Cl2 and Br2. Further complicating the situation
is the fact that the thermodynamic standard potentials for these reactions
are within a few hundred millivolts of that for water oxidation (Scheme 1).6 Thus, successful water oxidation catalysts operating in
seawater must demonstrate kinetic selectivity for water oxidation
and minimize ancillary oxidative side-reactions.

Reduction Potentials for Redox Reactions
Relevant to Seawater Electrolysis
We have developed catalysts that are capable of self-healing,7 thus allowing water splitting to be performed
under environmental conditions. Included among these catalysts are
oxidic metallates of manganese,8−10 cobalt,11,12 and nickel.13,14 For cobalt−phosphate (CoPi), we have previously shown these catalysts to be capable
of operating in natural waters15 at faradaic
efficiencies near 100%. However, we have yet to assess their selectivity
against halogen gas formation. To this end, we now apply the technique
of differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) to quantify
the production of halogen from seawater using CoPi and
nickel-borate (NiBi) water-splitting catalysts.

Results
and Discussion
DEMS is an experimental technique in which
an electrochemical flow
cell is interfaced with a mass spectrometer via a gas-permeable membrane16−18 to allow products generated electrochemically at the working electrode
to be detected by mass spectrometry in real time. Our group has previously
used DEMS to examine the production of O2 by metallate
oxygen-evolving catalysts (M-OECs) as well as to perform isotopic
labeling studies to identify the details of OER and hydrocarbon oxidation
by M-OEC catalysts.19,20 As we show here, this technique
is particularly valuable for measuring halogen gas production as these
gases are easily detected by mass spectrometry.

Chloride is
present in seawater at high concentrations (∼0.5
M)21 and, thus, constitutes the greatest
potential source of a toxic byproduct. Figure 1 shows the Pourbaix diagram25 for aqueous Cl– solutions; the most probable
Cl– oxidation products in the potential range needed
for O2 generation are Cl2, HClO, and ClO–. Consequently, we undertook studies to investigate
the products of water oxidation in the presence of Cl– and to quantitate the production of Cl2, HClO, and ClO–.

Figure 1 Simplified Pourbaix diagram at 25 °C for the aqueous
metastable
hypochlorites in the chlorine–water system (1 M). Solid black
lines delineate regions of stability for chlorine-containing species.
Dashed blue lines delineate regions of stability for O2, H2O, and H2, from top to bottom. The purple
and green bars indicate the potential ranges over which CoPi and NiBi DEMS experiments were performed, respectively.

To emulate the concentration of NaCl in seawater,
a solution of
0.5 M NaCl and 0.1 M buffer (either KPi at pH 7 or KBi at pH 9.2 for CoPi and NiBi, respectively)
was prepared. This solution was flowed through the DEMS electrochemical
cell at a rate of 60 mL/h with CoPi or NiBi as
the catalyst. Cyclic voltammetry was employed for current–time
measurements because it enabled us to easily examine potential byproducts
over a wide potential range.

Figure 2 shows the
results of cyclic voltammetry and DEMS experiments for the CoPi and NiBi catalysts. The redox feature at 0.7 V
has been observed for NiBi in the presence of salts and
has been assigned to a Ni(II)(OH2)2/Ni(III)O(OH)
surface redox event.23 For both catalysts,
no Cl2 production is observed over the entire potential
range examined. Although we did not detect any Cl2 in the
reaction headspace, it is known that Cl2 will react with
water in neutral or basic solutions to form HClO/ClO–.22 Thus, we performed additional bulk
electrolysis experiments to determine whether we were producing appreciable
amounts of HClO/ClO–. Electrolysis was performed
at an OER overpotential of ηOER = 490 mV for ∼12
h. We employed a spectroscopic detection test to quantify HClO/ClO– in our electrolyte post-electrolysis (see the Experimental Section). We determined that the faradaic
efficiencies for HClO/ClO– production were 3.2 ±
1.1 and 0.4 ± 0.1% for CoPi and NiBi, respectively.

films operated in an aqueous solution containing 500 mM NaCl and either
100 mM KPi at pH 7 for CoPi experiments or 100
mM KBi at pH 9.2 for NiBi experiments. Cyclic
voltammetry was performed at a scan rate of 5 mV/s.

We also examined the selectivity for oxygen generation by
CoBi and NiBi catalysts in seawater. Using water
collected
from Boston Harbor, a solution buffered to pH 9.2 with 100 mM KBi was prepared. We note that we were unable to prepare solutions
using KPi as a buffer, as phosphate is incompatible with
the Ca2+ ions present in seawater and rapidly precipitates
as calcium phosphate. Figure 3 shows that Cl2 was not detected from seawater
oxidation over all potentials examined. We note that the NiII(OH)2/NiIIIO(OH) surface redox feature is suppressed
is seawater as has been observed previously,15 and its disappearance is suggestive of surface passivation in seawater.
An additional byproduct to consider when electrolyzing seawater is
Br2, which can be produced from the oxidation of Br– anions present in natural seawater. Although Br– is present in significantly lower concentrations (∼0.8
mM)24 than Cl– in saltwater,
this concentration difference may be offset by the fact that Br– can be oxidized to Br2 at a lower potential
than both Cl– oxidation and OER (Scheme 1). However, as Figure 3 reveals, no Br2 was produced upon seawater electrolysis. Analogous to Cl2, Br2 may react with water in neutral or basic solutions
to form HBrO/BrO–.24 Thus,
we also tested for HClO/ClO– and HBrO/BrO– production during electrolysis of seawater. Using the same procedure
as was used for the NaCl electrolysis, we determined that the faradaic
efficiencies for the combined production of HClO/ClO– and HBrO/BrO– were 1.4 ± 0.5 and 4.3 ±
0.1% for CoBi and NiBi, respectively.

experimental data for CoBi (left) and NiBi (right)
films operated in seawater collected from Boston Harbor buffered to
pH 9.2 with 100 mM KBi. Cyclic voltammetry was performed
at a scan rate of 5 mV/s.

The excellent selectivity of these catalysts against Cl2 and Br2 is likely a result of their ability to operate
in neutral pH environments, which disfavor the production of Cl2 or Br2 gas.26 Further,
the minute concentrations of HClO/ClO– and HBrO/BrO– produced by these catalysts demonstrate that these
catalysts are largely selective against halide oxidation. Two features
of these catalysts likely contribute to this selectivity. First, the
potential for Cl–/Br– oxidation
to Cl2/Br2 is pH-independent, whereas the potential
for water oxidation decreases with increasing pH. Thus, the ability
of these catalysts to operate in neutral (as opposed to acidic) solutions
lowers the thermodynamic potential for water oxidation relative to
halide oxidation. Second, and more importantly, O–O bond formation
occurs by the reaction of terminal oxygens coordinated to the edge
of the CoPi/Bi and NiBi metallate
catalysts.22 The edges of the metallate
clusters are exposed by substitution of Bi and Pi with water, as shown in the first step of the reaction cycle depicted
in Scheme 2. Owing
to the large disparity in reactant concentrations, H2O
can outcompete halide ions for edge sites. Accordingly, we posit that
water oxidation is favored kinetically over the oxidation of halide
ions.

Scheme 2 Water Oxidation on CoPi Occurs Intramolecularly
at the
Edges of a Dicobalt Active Site
In conclusion, we have used DEMS to demonstrate that CoPi and NiBi catalysts are capable of generating O2 from seawater at high selectivity by suppressing the oxidation of
Cl– and Br–. As the kinetics for
oxidation by these catalysts is directed by edge reactivity of the
substrate, the inability of halide to compete with water association
at the edge sites of the cluster appears to be an important factor
for the selective generation of oxygen. We anticipate that these results
will be beneficial to applications that target the generation of oxygen
using seawater as an oxygen source.

Experimental Section
Materials
Co(NO3)2·6H2O (99.999%) and
Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (99.999%) were
used as received from Strem. KOH 88% and
KH2PO4 99.9% were reagent grade and used as
received from Macron. Unless otherwise indicated, all electrolyte
solutions were prepared with type I water (EMD Millipore, 18.2 MΩ
cm resistivity). NaCl was ACS reagent grade and was purchased from
VWR. Boston Harbor water samples were collected by hand from a location
in the Fort Point Channel.

General Electrochemical Methods
All electrochemical
experiments were conducted using a CH Instruments 760C or 760D bipotentiostat,
a BASi Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and a Pt wire counter electrode
for steady-state electrochemical measurements. The working electrodes
were CoPi and NiBi, as described below. All
experiments were performed at room temperature (23 ± 1 °C).

Preparation of Thin Films for Use in DEMS and Bulk Electrolysis
Experiments
The CoPi and CoBi thin-film
electrocatalysts were prepared via anodic electrodeposition, according
to previously reported procedures.25 The
deposition of the CoPi film was carried out in 0.1 M KPi pH 7 electrolyte containing 0.5 mM Co2+. A constant
potential was held at 0.85 V (all potentials are referenced to Ag/AgCl
unless noted otherwise) for a total of 35 mC/cm2 charge
passed. The deposition of the CoBi film was carried out
in 0.1 M KBi pH 9.2 electrolyte containing 0.5 mM Co2+. A constant potential was held at 0.75 V for a total of
35 mC/cm2 charge passed. For electrodes used in DEMS experiments,
a glassy carbon working electrode fabricated for the DEMS electrochemical
cell (diameter 7.2 mm) was used as the substrate for deposition of
catalyst films. For films used in bulk electrolysis experiments, fluorine-doped
tin oxide-coated glass plates were used as substrates. Kapton tape
was applied to these plates such that a 1 cm2 area was
exposed to the deposition solution.

The NiBi thin-film
electrocatalyst was prepared in a similar manner. The deposition was
carried out in 0.1 M KBi, pH 9.2 electrolyte containing
0.5 mM Ni2+. A constant potential was held at 0.95 V for
a total of 35 mC/cm2 charge passed. The NiBi film was then anodized by passing a constant current of 3.5 mA/cm2 for 30 min in a 1 M KBi, pH 9.2 solution.

Differential
Electrochemical Mass Spectrometry (DEMS) Experimental
Setup
DEMS experiments were conducted on a home-designed/assembled
DEMS system that has a detection limit of ∼0.1 nmol. The DEMS
setup consists of two differentially pumped chambers (ionization chamber
and analysis chamber) and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (PrismaPlus
QMF 110, Pfeiffer-Vacuum). The ionization and analysis chambers were
pumped to high vacuum by two Pfeiffer 65 L/s turbomolecular pumps
backed by a Pfeiffer dry diaphragm pump, to avoid contamination by
oil vapors. The PrismaPlus quadrupole mass spectrometer was connected
to the analysis chamber and equipped with electron multiplier/faraday
cup dual detecting units. The time constant of the mass spectrometer
was in the millisecond regime. Mass spectrometric data was collected
with the Quadera software, with three selective channels recording m/z of 32, 70, and 160 in real-time during
the electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments.

A dual
thin-layer flow electrochemical cell made of Kel-F was connected to
the ionization chamber via an angle valve. The upper chamber, which
houses the electrochemical reaction, is connected to the lower chamber,
which is under high vacuum and in line with the mass spectrometer,
by six capillaries. In the upper compartment, the working electrode
is pressed against a ∼100 mm thick Teflon gasket with an inner
diameter of 6 mm, leaving an exposed working electrode area of 0.28
cm2 and resulting in an electrolyte volume of ∼3
μL. In the lower compartment, a porous Teflon membrane (Gore-Tex)
supported on a stainless-steel frit serves as the interface between
the electrolyte and the vacuum. It is pressed against a ∼100
mm thick Teflon gasket with an inner diameter of 6 mm. The Gore-Tex
Teflon membrane has a thickness of ∼75 μm, a mean pore
size of 0.02 μm, and a porosity of 50%. A leak-free Ag/AgCl
reference electrode is connected at the inlet side of the flow cell
by insertion into a capillary, and a Pt wire counter electrode is
connected in a similar fashion at the outlet of the cell. The electrolyte
was purged with argon for 1 h before being transferred to a syringe
pump (Harvard Apparatus PHD 2000 Infusion). The flow of the electrolyte
flow into the electrochemical cell was then controlled by the syringe
pump, at 60 mL/h, which ensured fast transport of the species formed
at the electrode to the mass spectrometric compartment where the volatile
products were evaporated into the vacuum system of the DEMS via the
porous Teflon membrane.

CV experiments were performed using
a CH Instruments 760C potentiostat.
All CVs were performed using a 5 mV/s scan rate. For experiments in
NaCl solutions, five full cycles were performed, whereas for seawater
solutions, two full cycles were performed. Good reproducibility between
cycles was observed for all experimental conditions. Data from a single
representative cycle is given for each experimental condition in Figures 2 and 3.

Quantification of Hypochlorite and Hypobromite
To determine
the faradaic efficiency for HClO/ClO– and HBrO/BrO– production, bulk electrolysis was performed for each
catalyst/electrolyte combination. For all electrolysis experiments,
the reaction was driven at ηOER = 490 mV (1.1 and
0.98 V vs Ag/AgCl for pH 7 and pH 9.2, respectively) for ∼12
h before stopping the electrolysis and analyzing the products.

Following electrolysis, HClO/ClO– and HBrO/BrO– were quantified using the N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) method.26,27 Briefly, for each sample to be analyzed, a solution of 25 mM DPD
was prepared by adding 50 μL of a 1 M DPD stock solution to
2 mL of the sample in a quartz cuvette with a 1 cm pathlength. The
UV–vis absorption spectrum of the resulting solution was then
recorded using a Varian Cary 5000 spectrometer. DPD is oxidized by
any HClO/ClO– or HBrO/BrO– present
in the solution to form a colored cation radical dye species (shown
below). Here, we used absorption at 531 nm as an indicator of the
concentration of the dye. Because HClO, ClO–, HBrO,
and BrO– all oxidize DPD to the same compound, this
assay does not distinguish between these four species. Thus, we report
the combined faradaic efficiency for all of these species.Calibration
curves were constructed for 100 mM KPi, pH 7.0 solutions
(Figure S2) and 100
mM KBi, pH 9.2 solutions (Figure S4), using absorption at 531 nm as an indicator of the combined HClO/ClO– and HBrO/BrO– concentration. Calibration
curves were constructed using ClO– but are applicable
for the quantification of combined HClO, ClO–, HBrO,
and BrO– for the reasons described above.

Faradaic efficiencies were calculated using the following equation  where Vtot is
the total volume of the electrolysis cell, CClO–/BrO– is the combined
concentration of HClO/ClO– and HBrO/BrO– as determined by the DPD test, Q is the total charge
passed during the bulk electrolysis, and F is Faraday’s
constant.
