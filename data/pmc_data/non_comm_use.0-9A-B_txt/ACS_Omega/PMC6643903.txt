Fabrication of reproducible and versatile
surface-enhanced Raman
scattering (SERS) substrates is crucial for real-time applications
such as explosive detection for human safety and biological imaging
for cancer diagnosis. However, it still remains a challenging task,
even after several methodologies were developed by various research
groups, primarily due to (a) a lack of consistency in detection of
a variety of molecules (b) cost-effectiveness of the SERS substrates
prepared, and (c) byzantine preparation procedures, etc. Herein, we
establish a procedure for preparing reproducible SERS-active substrates
comprised of laser-induced nanoparticle-embedded periodic surface
structures (LINEPSS) and metallization of silicon (Si) LINEPSS. LINEPSS
were fabricated using the technique of femtosecond laser ablation
of Si in acetone. The versatile SERS-active substrates were then achieved
by two ways, including the drop casting of silver (Ag)/gold (Au) nanoparticles
(NPs) on Si LINEPSS and Ag plating on the Si LINEPSS structures. By
controlling the LINEPSS grating periodicity, the effect of plasmonic
nanoparticles/plasmonic plating on the Si NPs embedded periodic surface
structures enormously improved the SPR strength, resulting in the
consistent and superior Raman enhancements. The reproducible SERS
signals were achieved by detecting the molecules of Methylene Blue
(MB), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), and 5-amino-3-nitro-l,2,4-triazole
(ANTA). The SERS signal strength is determined by the grating periodicity,
which, in turn, is determined by the input laser fluence. The SERS-active
platform with grating periodicity of 130 ± 10 nm and 150 ±
5 nm exhibited strong Raman enhancements of ∼108 for MB and ∼107 for ANTA molecules, respectively,
and these platforms are demonstrated to be capable, even for multiple
usages.

Introduction
In the present scenario
of prevailing terror activities, the security
of personnel and the important infrastructure has gained significance
worldwide (e.g., to avert encounters from terrorist activities), and
efforts are directed toward overcoming the ineptitude of existing
diagnostic tools, including obliteration of health hazards (e.g.,
early stage detection of cancer, trace level detection of bacteria).1−3 One of the possible solutions for the above-mentioned problems is
the development of detection techniques and improvisation of diagnostic
limits incorporating advanced technologies. With the fast development
of spectroscopy techniques, standoff and near-field detection studies
have been established by various groups for the detection of explosives.
However, there is no such universal technique that is capable of detecting
diverse explosives positively in a single experiment. Some spectroscopic
methods that have been extensively studied to identify explosive molecules
involve either tedious processes or require expensive equipment. Among
many such detection techniques, spectroscopic tools that incorporate
Raman scattering as the key element are efficient and practical, since
these are versatile for explosives detection and health diagnostics.4 Raman spectroscopy is an excellent technique
that works both in near field and standoff modes, especially for explosives
detection. Although spontaneous Raman scattering techniques demonstrate
significant molecular finger prints, it cannot accomplish trace level
detection, because of its very small scattering cross-section (∼10–36 cm2/molecule). In 1974, Fleischman et
al.5 experimentally demonstrated the first
Raman signal enhancements (5 to 6 orders) of pyridine molecules adsorbed
on a coarsened silver electrode, which was later named as surface-enhanced
Raman scattering (SERS). In SERS, any molecule in the close vicinity
(<4 nm) of a nanomaterial experiences the fourth power of local
electric field by the excitation of surface plasmons. As a result,
polarizability of the molecule is enhanced and, hence, the Raman scattering
cross section increases gigantically. SERS has now become an extensively
investigated hot topic, and developments have reached a highpoint
that this technique is now capable even to detect/identify single
molecules. The single molecular (SM) detection was performed by two
individual groups Kneipp et al. and Nie et al.6,7 They
described the gigantic evanescent fields as being due to the hot spots,
which are rederived from the combined localized surface plasmon resonances,
produced between the junctions of nanoparticles. The Raman signal
intensity is extremely influenced by the morphological/topographical
aspects of a nanomaterial such as size, shape, and uniformity of the
nanostructure on the substrate, which affect the reproducibility of
SERS signal from a SERS-active platform.8 Plasmonic metal plating (or) nanoparticles coated on nanoporous
semiconductors9 (or) patterned dielectric
substrates10 were synthesized by chemical
and physical methods. These substrates have received strong attention
and became hot areas in SERS, which could demonstrate huge Raman signal
enhancements. However, the reproducibility factor, less consistency,
great sensitivity, and detection efficiency have been important factors
limiting the SERS applications for large-area detection. To maximize
the reproducibility factor of the SERS-active substrate with the largest
uniformity, various methods have been implemented to produce nanostructures
with high uniformity. These methods include dual interference lithography,11 high-resolution electron beam lithography,12 ion beam lithography,13 anodic aluminum oxide template-assisted electrochemical deposition,14 electroless etching,15 and ultrafast laser ablation technique.16 Such methods are capable to generate large-area uniform SERS-active
substrates. Versatile SERS-active substrates are urgently required
for real-time applications, such as trace level detection of explosives17,18 and imaging of microorganisms.19 Nanoaggregation
of plasmonic metals (or) nanoparticles dispersed on plasmonic metal
sheet provides irregularities and offer randomly distributed hotspots
because of the coupling of metal nanostructures/nanoparticles, leading
to huge random SERS enhancement. Scientists confirmed that SERS enhancement
was obtained17 because of randomly oriented
hotspots is more than the enhancement obtained in the case of roughened/corrugated
nanostructures20,21 and individual nanoparticles
(NPs) of traditional plasmonic metals (Au, Ag, and Cu).22,23 However, the substrates with randomly oriented hot spots may not
serve as uniform SERS-active substrates, because of the lack of homogeneity
in the Raman signals recorded from different locations of the SERS-active
platform. To address the issue of homogeneity and reproducibility
of SERS signal, periodic nanostructures are the most suitable candidates
and a sensible investigation was done by some researchers.24−29 Pioneers of the field fabricated large-area ridged hexagonal nanostructures
using interference lithography and demonstrated reproducible SERS
with tenability.11 Yokota et al.12 have recently reported the SERS studies of crystal
violet molecules at ultralow concentrations in the vicinity of highly
controlled nanoengineered Au square blocks using high-resolution electron
lithography. The anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) deposition method was
utilized to generate large-area gold-nanoparticle-coated polymer pillar
arrays for reproducible and significant SERS enhancement.30 The R2R UV-NIL and AAO techniques were employed
to fabricate continuous cost-effective polymer nanostructure arrays,
and these substrates have shown SERS enhancement for R6G molecule
on the order of 107.31 However,
all of the above-mentioned methods are quite cumbersome, time-consuming
with low throughput, and highly expensive. At the same time, the residual
chemical contents remain on the surface of the nanomaterial, which
are very difficult to get rid of completely. In order to overcome
the difficulties posed by the other well-known methods of nanomaterial
fabrication, ultrafast laser ablation is one of the simple and time-saving
top-down approaches to green synthesis.

Femtosecond (fs) laser
ablation is a powerful tool to fabricate
microstructures and nanostructures for biomedical,32−34 wettability,35 and photonics applications.36 Focusing an ultrafast laser beam at the liquid/material
interface helps to engineer the desired nanomaterials with required
shapes, as a function of the influence of liquid parameters (viscosity,
polarity, etc.), laser fluence, and pulse number. The fs laser irradiation/ablation
technique offers laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS)
on the surface of every material, such as metals,37−39 semiconductors,40−42 and dielectrics.43−45 In fs direct writing, many techniques have been developed
to optimize the fabrication process and generate nanostructures with
size lower than the diffraction limit.46−49 Fadeeva et al.50 reviewed biomimetic liquid-repellent surfaces via ultrafast
laser processing and summarized the modifications of different materials
(metals, semiconductors, and polymers). There are some reports that
demonstrated the randomly aligned and well-controlled surface structures.
In the last two decades, several mechanisms behind the formation of
LIPSS have been proposed by researchers.51−62 First, LIPSS are formed due to the interference of incident wave
and surface electromagnetic wave propagating along the ablated surface.63 Second, when light interacts with porous surface
of the material, it introduces a scaling factor that arises due to
nonuniform energy distribution of the ultrafast laser pulse on the
ablated surface. This leads to a nonuniform absorption of pulse energy
and consequently generates LIPSS.56 The
later theory (or) mechanism, along with surface electromagnetic wave
(or) plasmon polaritons wave concepts, was universally accepted by
many research groups. Unlike nanoparticles, LIPSS offer extraordinary
applications, such as those in optical data storage, color displays,
hydrophobic/hydrophilic, wetting, bacterial cell (or) any other cell
growth, SERS, and many industrial fields. Particularly, the esteemed
application of LIPSS substrates is that they act as SERS-active platforms
with very significant features, which cannot be seen in other contemporary
SERS platforms. The processing of LIPSS on semiconductors (or) dielectrics
and eventually gold/silver plating on them can be extensively used
as SERS-active substrates. In contrast, LIPSS processing on plasmonic
materials (gold,51 silver) have not been
studied extensively, because of their partially compatible thermophysical
properties. The main reason behind the low priority of LIPSS processing
on Au and Ag, when compared with semiconductors and dielectrics, especially
concerns the electronic configuration of plasmonic materials, which
anticipate low electron–phonon coupling constant.64 Electron–phonon coupling constant plays
a unique role in the formation of nonuniform energy distribution on
the surface of the material, which leads to LIPSS. Thus far, various
groups have demonstrated LIPSS processing on silicon substrate using
the fs ablation/writing technique40,41,47,48,57,65,66 and few groups confirmed that the Ag/Au plating on silicon LIPSS
can also be used as very good SERS-active substrates.67 Moreover, Ag coated on randomly formed silica NSs by fs
ablation technique was explored as SERS-active substrates.68 Yang et al.16 have
reported the fs laser fabricated microstructures/nanostructures on
Si wafer, coated with Ag layer through thermal deposition for SERS
detection of biomolecules. Zhu et al.69 have proposed a quick and straightforward method to fabricate large-area
SERS-active Si substrates by fs laser pulses, which were covered with
Au thin film and demonstrated an enhancement factor an order of 107 in the case of R6G molecule. In the current work, we demonstrate
the fabrication of a new SERS substrate including laser-induced nanoparticles
embedded in periodic surface structures (LINEPSS) on Si substrate
and Ag/Au metallization of Si nanostructures. These Si structures
were produced using fs pulses and appropriate fluences that facilitate
the processing of localized surface structures on silicon, i.e., submerged
in a liquid medium. The productive SERS-active substrates are then
acquired by plasmonic NPs deposited by drop casting/plasmonic plating
on LINEPSS using an ion beam deposition method. In fact, this unique
SERS substrate is able to provide various hotspots at once, which
result in the formation of high electromagnetic field sites and therefore
produce a huge enhancement in the signal. In generic SERS-active platforms,
NPs support the localized surface plasmons (LSPs). In the present
case, (i) the dispersed Ag/Au NPs on LINEPSS substrate allow the creation
of a higher number/multiple hotspots, which support strong localized
surface plasmons and lead to a higher enhancement in the SERS signal;
(ii) Ag-film-coated LINEPSS substrate permit excitation of both localized
surface plasmons and propagating surface plasmons (PSPs), which tremendously
enhances the local field and, consequently, the Raman signal. This
could be the advantage of LINEPSS compared to ordinary SERS-active
platforms. Furthermore, uniformity and stability of the fabricated
LINEPSS substrates have been investigated for their reproducibility
and multiple utility SERS measurements. This study can possibly yield
an effective way for the fabrication of uniform SERS-active substrates.

Results
and Discussion
In order to fabricate the surface nanostructures,
we have performed
fs ablation of Si in acetone at different fluences much more beyond
the limit of ablation threshold (Fth =
0.3 J/cm2). The results presented in Figure 1 illustrate the size/shape variation of Si
nanostructures, depending on the laser fluence. Figures 1a–f represent the FESEM micrographs
for laser-machined Si substrates with various fluences, ranging from
0.08–3 J/cm2 in acetone for 30 min. These images
demonstrate the formation of high-spatial-frequency LIPSS (HSFL) structures
on the Si(100) substrate. By considering 300 lines from SEM images
in each case,16,17,19−22 the average periodicity of HSFL structures on the Si substrate was
estimated to be 350 ± 20 nm, 285 ± 15 nm, 130 ± 10
nm, 150 ± 5 nm, 200 ± 30 nm, and disjointed LIPSS for 0.08
J/cm2, 0.19 J/cm2, 0.38 J/cm2, 0.75
J/cm2, 1.5 J/cm2, and 3 J/cm2, respectively.
A plausible mechanism for the formation of LIPSS structures on a solid
surface is the absorption and relaxations of the carrier density with
excitation of fs pulses in liquid media. Various scattering effects
can also be observed at different time scales. When the fs pulses
interact with acetone-immersed Si, the energy of the leading part
is principally deposited on Si at the liquid/material interface and
Si absorbs the energy by inverse Bremsstrahlung70,71 through the two-photon (or) multiphoton absorption process within
the period of ∼10–100 fs at higher peak intensities.
The excited electrons collide with each other (or) with bounded electrons,
resulting in the production of high electron density in Si which approaches
close to the critical electron density of Si. The same kind of behavior
can be expected in acetone, because of the optical Kerr effect at
similar high peak intensity. Under these conditions, the optical properties
of both materials (acetone and Si) are modified to a great extent
and acquire almost metallic behavior72,73 at the liquid/material
interface. Later on, the trailing part of the ultrafast laser pulse
interacts with the material melt, which has acquired the metallic
behavior.

J/cm2; (b, c, d, e) clear view of nanoparticle-embedded

J/cm2, 1.5 J/cm2; and (f) disjointed LIPSS at
3 J/cm2 and its inset shows the lower-magnification image
(1 μm scale bar). Arrow marks depict the laser beam polarization
direction.

The interaction of the trailing
part with the melt excites the
possible plasmonic modes, leading to the generation of surface plasmon
polaritons (SPP).72,73 The generated SPP waves interfere
with incident electromagnetic wave and produces LIPSS on the Si surface.
As per the literature, the interference mechanism could be more suitable
to the formation of low-spatial-frequency LIPSS (LSFL) structures
in an air medium, described successfully by many scientists based
on Drude–Sipes theory. According to this theory, Huang et al.,74 Bonse et al.,40,53 and Sipe et
al.56 have explained the orientation of
polarization and characteristics of LSFL structures. The physical
mechanism behind the formation of HSFL in air is still being debated.

Figure 2 illustrates
the FESEM images of (a) LSFL structures and (b) HSFL structures (with
large number of pulses) formed on silicon on silicon in air at ∼0.38
J/cm2 fluence. As observed from Figures 1c and 2b, both HSFL
structures in acetone and air are having different orientation of
surface structures (polarization) with different periods. In the case
of acetone, HSFL with a periodicity ∼130 nm is generated and
their orientation is perpendicular to the incident field polarization.
In air, HSFL nanostructures with a periodicity of ∼370 nm are
generated with an orientation that is parallel to the incident field
polarization. It was observed that the orientation of HSFL structures
in liquid media is more similar to LSFL structures (Figure 2 a, 700 nm) orientation (perpendicular
to incident field polarization direction) in air.75 This similarity could be due to the same physical mechanism
process occurring during the production of HSFL structures in liquid
and LSFL structures in air. Miyaji et al.73 proposed an SPP wave model for HSFL formation in liquid media. In
addition, we observed the deposition of Si nanoparticles on LIPSS
structures in Figures 1c–e when the fluences were greater than the ablation threshold
of the Si. We obtained average sizes of the Si nanoparticles using
SEM image and image J software, wherein we have taken at least 250
nanoparticles from 4 SEM images. The mean size of Si NPs are estimated
to be ∼150 nm, ∼90 nm, ∼67 nm, ∼135 nm,
and ∼95 nm for 0.19 J/cm2, 0.38 J/cm2, 0.75 J/cm2, 1.5 J/cm2, and 3 J/cm,2 respectively. At higher fluences, plasma generation
occurs at a particular stage and expands to generate the shock wave.
During the development of a shock wave, the expansion of plasma in
the plume form moves into the surrounding liquid media and it gets
quenched within the time scale of 100 ns,76 resulting in the formation of a cavitation bubble. The bubble follows
a radial motion, because of its sinusoidal driving pressure.77 When the rarefaction part of the pressure field
interacts with medium, the cavitation bubble increases in size, which
increases the pressure inside the bubble, compared to the surrounding
pressure.78 As in the case of the compression
part, the size of the bubble slightly decreases, because of the slow
pressure increase inside the bubble. After a few microseconds, the
continuous cavitation bubble grows in the form of compression and
rarefaction. During the bubble growth, the bubble contains nanosized
ablated material.76,79 However, the rapid growth of
the bubble, followed by collapse, typically occurs within a time scale
of 10–300 μs. During the expansion of CB into the surrounding
liquid, the medium exerts a gigantic pressure on the metallic plume.
This recoil pressure splashes the metal plume into nanoparticles.
Transient dynamics of the plasma can prompt composite material fabrication,
because of its interaction with the liquid medium surrounding it.80−83 Subsequently, the vaporized material fragments resolidify (generation
of NPs) over a time scale of few hundreds of microseconds. During
the process of (CB’s) expansion, the temperature gradient in
the inner and outer surfaces of the CB leads to condensation and growth
of NPs. The produced nanoparticles slow their velocity by losing their
kinetic energy during the collision with other species or clusters,
and some of them end up landing on Si LIPSS, because of van der Waals
forces and form the LINEPSS. It is familiar that laser ablation of
Si in air and water at higher fluences produced SiO2 on
the surface of the Si.16

regions on crystalline Si in air:

and (b) high-special-frequency LIPSS (HSFL) formed with ∼700

laser beam polarization direction.

Figure 3 shows
the
Raman spectrum of ablated Si substrates at different fluences of 0.08–3
J/cm2 in acetone for 30 min, which demonstrate crystalline
nature of the Si nanostructures. In the Raman spectrum, mainly a broad
peak at 518 cm–1 was observed, along with 470 cm–1 peak, which confirmed the formation of nanocrystalline
and nanoamorphous Si on the ablated surface. In order to interpret
the constituents on the Si surface after the ablation of Si in acetone,
energy-dispersive X-ray (EDAX) analysis of Si LINEPSS structures fabricated
at different fluences (0.08 J/cm2, 0.19 J/cm2, 0.38 J/cm2, 0.75 J/cm2, 1.5 J/cm2, and 3 J/cm2) have been executed in FESEM system (at
5 eV), as shown in Figure 4. The EDAX data demonstrated that lower and higher fluences
induce the minimal oxidation and this oxidation does not affect the
SERS efficiency.

an
amorphous peak near 480 cm–1 and asymmetric crystalline
peak at 519 cm–1.

effect on the substrates.

Figure 5 illustrates
the EDAX spectra of Ag nanoparticles (∼15 nm) (Figure 5a) and Au nanoparticles (∼10
nm) (Figure 5b) deposited
on LINEPSS structures, revealing peaks corresponding to Ag/Au and
Si in all cases. The morphology of Ag and Au colloidal NPs were reported
by our group in earlier articles.84 This
certifies that Ag/Au NPs and Si NPs were successfully observed without
any significant impurities. Figures 5c and 5d illustrate the EDAX
and FESEM images of Ag film deposited on Si LINEPSS structures fabricated
at a fluence of 0.75 J/cm2, respectively. The EDAX spectra
of Ag film deposited on Si LINEPSS structures exhibit Ag and Si peaks.
As seen in Figure 5d, the shape of film is irregular and formed as Ag islands on Si
LINEPSS. These Ag island-shaped films on Si NPs allow to produce localized
surface plasmons and nanoroughness on Si grating NSs may lead to the
excitation of propagating surface plasmon and the combined effect
of localized and propagating surface plasmons leads to a strong SERS
signal.

Au peaks, and (d) FESEM image of Ag plating on Si LINEPSS substrate
fabricated at 0.75 J/cm2.

SERS Performance of the Substrates
It is obvious from
the earlier reports on the SERS measurements that the excitation of
nontransparent hybrid plasmonic (or) plasmonic nanostructures with
785 nm is beneficial when compared to other excitation wavelengths,
since they possess higher surface plasmons at 785 nm. In this study,
laser Raman portable system with a beam diameter of 0.2 mm and an
excitation wavelength of 785 nm is utilized to acquire SERS spectra
of all the substrates. The efficiency of SERS-active hybrid nanostructures
was exploited by means of enhancement in Raman signal obtained from
Methylene Blue (MB). As mentioned in the past research, enhancement
in Raman signal of substrates is related to different groove depths
of Si microgratings.67 To study the influence
of LIPSS periodicity on the Raman signal enhancement, SERS spectra
of Ag (∼15 nm) deposited onto Si LINEPSS with different periodicity
were recorded and are shown in Figure 6a. As seen in Figure 6a, there are three prominent Raman bands observed at
447, 1393, and 1620 cm–1 in all SERS spectra, which
are well-matched with reported MB characteristic Raman peaks,84,85 and these modes correspond to C–N–C skeletal deformation,
C–N symmetrical stretch, and C–C ring stretching, respectively.
In addition, other vibrational modes were also observed at 770, 1037,
1161, and 1500 cm–1, which is an observation that
is consistent with other Raman bands of MB. As illustrated in Figure 6a, the Raman peak
intensity amplifies as the periodicity decreases from 350 ± 20
nm to 130 ± 10 nm and then the intensity starts decreasing at
150 ± 5 nm and further signal intensity decreases when the LINEPSS
structure gets extracted.

in yellow. (c) The linear relationship of log C vs
log I, demonstrating a R2 value of 0.99.

Among all the SERS-active
substrates, substrate with LINEPSS and
periodicity of 130 ± 10 nm demonstrated a superior SERS signal,
which could be due to a greater number of Ag nanoparticles dispersed
on the LINEPSS structure, and this condition allows MB molecules to
be adsorbed on Ag NPs in large numbers, because of the large uniform
substrate. Under these circumstances, the almost-dispersed Ag nanoparticles
on the LINEPSS substrate allows the creation of more multiple hotspots,
which might lead to strong enhancement of the evanescent electric
field. As in the case of larger periodicity of LINEPSS, Ag NPs dispersed
on the LINEPSS substrate might decrease and the distance between two
Ag NPs could be small and, hence, represent a smaller number of hotspots,
which boosts the enhancement of local field significantly. However,
the substrate with disjointed LINEPSS generates a very low SERS signal,
which could be accredited to the lower density of the Ag NPs that
cover the Si LINEPSS substrate, and this results in minimal hotspots.
Hence, our studies demonstrated that Ag NPs covered on LINEPSS with
a periodicity of 130 ± 10 nm is the most favorable substrate
for SERS enhancement. In comparison, the substrate with Ag NPs on
plain Si exhibited very small signal strength and this small signal
could be due to the lesser number of hotspots (or) individual surface
plasmon effect. The SERS enhancement obtained is ∼100 times
lower for Ag NPs on plain Si substrate, when compared to the enhancement
obtained in the case of LINEPSS with a periodicity of 130 ± 10
nm. Figure 6b illustrates
SERS spectra of MB molecules of different concentrations adsorbed
on LINEPSS with a periodicity of 130 ± 10 nm and it is demonstrated
that the SERS signal intensity increased with MB concentration. As
is evident from the data presented in Figure 6b, a considerable intensity was observed,
even at lower concentration (10–9), confirming the
highly sensitive nature of the present SERS substrate. Figure 6c illustrates a log–log
plot of SERS intensity versus the concentration of MB, and the data
obtained established a linear relationship with the increasing concentration
of MB molecule.

To explore the enhancing capability of Ag-NPs-covered
LINEPSS substrates,
the enhancement factor (EF) in each case was evaluated by comparing
the SERS intensity of the molecule with normal Raman intensity of
same molecule (MB in this case) on plain Si surface using the formula21  Here, ISERS and IRaman refer to the Raman peak intensities
of
MB molecule at a 1 nM concentration (CSERS) on the SERS-active substrate and a 0.1 M concentration (Cref) on the pure Si substrate, respectively. NSERS and NRaman represent
the number of molecules contributing to the enhancement of Raman intensity
and normal Raman intensity, respectively. In the present study, we
estimated the EF values for the characteristic mode (1620 cm–1) of MB and found them to be 6.7 × 106, 9.3 ×
106, 1.5 × 108, 7.8 × 107, 3 × 107, and 5 × 106 for LINEPSS
substrates with a periodicity of 350 ± 20 nm, 285 ± 15 nm,
130 ± 10 nm, 150 ± 5 nm, 200 ± 30 nm, and disjointed
LIPSS, respectively. In our investigation, the highest EF value was
evaluated to be 1.5 × 108, which could be lower than
the other’s reported EF value for MB on the other substrates,
such as Ag–Au alloy nanoparticles86 and Ag NPs deposited porous Si.87 Hamdorf
et al.88 fabricated three-dimensional (3D)
large-area microstructures/nanostructures on silicon substrate in
three steps: (i) fs laser micromachining and roughening, followed
by (ii) thin-film coating and (iii) nanosecond laser heating and melting.
This 3D substrate provided an enhancement that was 100 times higher
than the EF value obtained in the case of a flat substrate. Other
researchers have confirmed that SERS efficiency changes under the
influence of size and shape of nanostructures, and a large uniform
SERS-active substrate can be utilized for the detection of more than
two probe molecules at a time.89,90 Our group recently
reported that the multiple utility of nanostructures for the trace
detection of organic molecules has been handled with a simple cleaning
process.21 Although the cleaning process
was gentle, it could possibly affect the surface morphology of the
NSs and, hence, affect the SERS performance. However, if the substrate
is efficient enough, one could achieve significant enhancements, even
after a second and third cleaning procedure, as was demonstrated earlier
by our group.21 The reproducibility of
the Raman peak intensities of analyte molecules adsorbed on SERS-active
substrates is a prerequisite for real-time practical applications.
For the confirmation of reproducibility behavior in our substrate,
we have recorded the SERS spectrum of MB (10–9 M)
in eight different locations on LINEPSS substrates with 130 ±
10 nm and 150 ± 5 nm, and found identical intensities, as illustrated
in the data of Figures 7a and 7b, respectively. Figures 7c and 7d demonstrate
the histogram plots for major Raman peak on two LINEPSS substrates
with 130 ± 10 nm and 150 ± 5 nm, and we estimated the relative
standard deviation (RSD) in both cases to be <8%. The RSD values
of <10% have confirmed that our substrates can be utilized for
practical applications. Subsequently, the above-mentioned two substrates,
such as the LINEPSS substrates with a periodicity of 130 ± 10
nm and 150 ± 5 nm, with Ag NPs, were employed again for the SERS
measurements of 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), following a sonication procedure
in acetone. Figure 8 illustrates the SERS spectra of DNT molecules recorded with a concentration
of 10–6 M collected from two LINEPSS substrates
(130 ± 10 nm and 150 ± 5 nm) dispersed with Ag NPs. The
SERS spectra clearly illustrate the peaks at 856 and 1344 cm–1, corresponding to NO2 out-of-plane mode and NO2 symmetric stretch mode, respectively.91e assumed that 30%–40% of the analyte molecules were adsorbed
on substrates. The estimated EF values for LINEPSS substrates with
a periodicity of 130 ± 10 nm and 150 ± 5 nm, and with Ag
NPs, were 4.9 × 105 and 1.6 × 105,
respectively.

Multiple Utility of Substrates
The efficient SERS substrates
should exhibit exceptional SERS activity with any plasmonic NPs (or)
plasmonic plating for any analyte molecules. To confirm these activities,
the Au NPs with a mean size of ∼10 nm were deposited on all
six LINEPSS substrates and the Raman spectra of MB were collected
from them. Later, Ag plating was deposited on the above-mentioned
six LINEPSS substrates after perfect cleaning and sonication of the
substrates. These substrates were again employed for recording the
SERS spectra of 5-amino-3-nitro-l,2,4-triazole (ANTA) molecules. Figure 9 illustrates Raman
spectra of MB (10–7 M) recorded from six different
substrates and the spectra revealed the prominent Raman bands, which
are observed at 448, 1391, and 1622 cm–1. The EF
values that have been evaluated in this case for the characteristic
mode (1622 cm–1) are 2.5 × 106,
1.3 × 106, 4.6 × 106, 4 × 106, 1.8 × 106, and 1 × 106 for
350 ± 20 nm, 285 ± 15 nm, 130 ± 10 nm, 150 ± 5
nm, 200 ± 30 nm, and disjointed LIPSS, respectively. Figure 10 shows the recorded
Raman spectra of molecules with a concentration of 1 × 10–6 M on Ag-thin-film-coated LINEPSS substrates and 0.1
M on plain silicon wafer (reference spectrum), using a micro Raman
spectrometer that had an excitation wavelength of 532 nm and an integration
time of 0.5 s. It is evident that the Raman modes were largely enhanced
on Ag-thin-film-coated LINEPSS substrates, compared with the modes
on plain silicon at higher concentration of 0.1 M. The peak at 1339
cm–1 is assigned to the C–NO2 symmetric
stretch vibration, which can be termed as the characteristic mode
of the molecule, while the other Raman modes observed at 952, 1125,
and 1585 cm–1 correspond to the N4–C5–N1
bending mode, the N–N symmetric stretching mode, and the C–NH2 symmetrical stretch + NH2 bend, respectively.
The Raman intensity was observed to increase as the periodicity of
LIPSS decreases from 350 ± 20 nm to 130 ± 10 nm. However,
the Raman intensity decreased when the periodicity was further increased
to 200 ± 30 nm and disjointed LIPSS. The size of formed Si NPs
on LIPSS might also have played a significant role to add their contribution
in Raman intensity enhancement. We believe that a small percentage
of molecules (<40%) in the hot spots contributed to enhanced Raman
intensity. To explore the enhancement capability of Ag metal plating
Si NSs, the EF values were evaluated by comparing the SERS intensity
with normal Raman intensity. Based on the intensities of the characteristic
peak at 1339 cm–1 in all SERS spectra, the EF values
were estimated to be ∼1.2 × 107, ∼1.3
× 107, ∼2 × 107, ∼5.32
× 107, ∼2.5 × 107, and ∼1.4
× 107 for different periodicity of LINEPSS (350 ±
20 nm, 285 ± 15 nm, 130 ± 10 nm, 150 ± 5 nm, 200 ±
30 nm, and disjointed LIPSS, respectively). Our SERS data unambiguously
revealed that the Ag metal plating on LINEPSS possesses potential
for detecting the Raman modes of ANTA analyte with larger enhancement,
and this might be ascribed to a large amplification of the local electric
field, which is due to the combination of localized surface plasmons
and propagating surface plasmons produced from the surfaces of spherical
NPs and contribution from the periodic surface structures, respectively.
The outcomes obtained from these studies demonstrate that laser-produced
nanoparticle-embedded LIPSS substrates covered with Ag/Au nanoparticles
and Ag thin film acquire efficient SERS reproducibility and stability,
even though SERS studies were performed on various days, which were
a few months apart. There is further scope for improvement in the
performance of these structures, following the optimization of the
Ag coating thickness and the periodicity of the gratings achieved.
Furthermore, a combination of NPs and NSs is also expected to advance
the detection capability (sensitivity). However, detailed studies
are essential toward achieving this.

Conclusions
A suitable liquid-assisted fs laser ablation
technique has been
used to investigate reproducible SERS substrates with multiple utility,
because of their stability, uniformity, and strong enhancement in
the Raman signal. In this work, laser-induced nanoparticle-embedded
periodic structures (LINEPSS) were fabricated by fs laser ablation
of silicon in acetone at different laser fluences. The obtained LIPSS
with different sizes utilized for SERS measurements in this study
were 350 ± 20 nm, 285 ± 15 nm, 130 ± 10 nm, 150 ±
5 nm, 200 ± 30 nm, and disjointed LIPSS, and the sizes of the
Si nanoparticles embedded on the surface of LIPSS are no NPs, ∼150
nm, ∼90 nm, ∼67 nm, ∼135 nm, and ∼95 nm
for 0.08 J/cm, 0.19 J/cm2, 0.38 J/cm2, 0.75
J/cm2, 1.5 J/cm2, and 3 J/cm2, respectively.
The efficient SERS substrates were then achieved by the deposition
of Ag/Au nanoparticles on the surface of nanoparticle-embedded laser-induced
periodic structures and they can create multiple hotspots. By employing
the stable and reproducible Ag NPs deposited SERS-active substrate
to the Raman studies of MB (10–9 M) molecule, the
highest EF value for MB at 1620 cm–1 was determined
to be 1.5 × 108 with good reproducibility throughout
the LINEPSS substrate (<8%). It was observed that the EF value
for the DNT molecule (10–6 M), ∼105, was achieved for Ag-NPs-deposited SERS-active substrates through
simple cleaning processes. Similarly, Au-NPs-deposited LINEPSS substrates
also produced enhanced Raman signal for MB molecule (10–7 M) and the EF value was ∼106. In addition to that,
Ag plating on the LINEPSS substrate can generate localized and propagating
surface plasmons, which enhanced the Raman spectra of ANTA molecule
(∼10–6 M) and demonstrate the average EF
value of ∼107. The strategy of our LINEPSSS fabrication
succeeded in the resulting high reproducibility, along with superior
Raman signal enhancements. Our future endeavor would be to prepare
robust SERS targets that could detect most common explosives at trace
concentrations, using a portable/hand-held Raman spectrometer, along
with the capability to detect a variety of explosive molecules.

Experimental
Details
The experimental schematic of ultrashort pulse laser
ablation for
LINEPSS fabrication is shown in Figure 1. Nanoparticle embedded LIPSS have been achieved in
a single-step fs ablation process on p-type crystalline
Si (100) substrate in liquid media. These experiments were performed
using 1 kHz chirped pulse amplified Ti:sapphire laser system (LIBRA,
M/s Coherent, USA) delivering nearly bandwidth limited laser pulses
of ∼50 fs pulse width at 800 nm. The average power from the
amplifier was ∼4 W. The laser beam was focused on the Si target,
which was submerged in acetone in a Pyrex cell, and the effective
thickness of liquid layer above the target was ∼5 mm. The Si
targets were cleaned in an ultrasonic cleaner with acetone to remove
the impurities before ablation. The refractive index and thickness
of liquid layer play a crucial role in affecting the laser fluence
at the focus on the surface of target. Consequently, the position
of the focal plane shifts toward the target, which modifies the beam
waist on the target surface. Moreover, the focal plane can shift, depending on the liquid media
and height of the liquid from the target surface. To avoid this shift,
we followed a strategy. First, we adjusted the focal plane exactly
on the target surface in air by listening to the furious sound and
observing the light produced by laser-induced plasma. The modification
of beam waist resulted in deposition of lesser fluence on the target.
Second, we evaluated the shift (distance) of the focal plane by following
the Menendez et al.92 procedure under the
effect of the refractive index (n) of the liquid
media and height of the liquid layer from the surface of the target
(h), by following the procedure mentioned in the
previous research.6 There is one more complexity
behind the beam waist diameter (2ω0) at focus on
the target, which plays a significant role in the mechanism of ablation.
The produced beam waist on the target in liquid media is considerably
larger than the beam waist generated in air. The increase in size
of the beam waist on the target in liquid media could be due to the
naturally existing nanoroughness (λ/10 or λ/12) of the
metal/semiconductor/dielectric materials (target). The estimated effective
spot size on the target surface was ∼140 μm, using the
above-mentioned process. The combination of a half wave plate and
a Brewster polarizer was utilized to control pulse energy and polarization
direction of the laser beam. In this study, the typical fluences used
were 0.08 J/cm2, 0.19 J/cm2, 0.38 J/cm2, 0.75 J/cm2, 1.5 J/cm2, and 3 J/cm2. The Pyrex cell, along with the submerged Si substrate in acetone,
is fixed on a Nanodirect (Model NTS-25) three-dimensional stage and
has a resolution of 25 nm, which is connected to the controller. The X–Y stages were utilized to scan
in such a way as to draw periodic lines with 100 μm spacing
using scanning speeds of ∼0.2 and 0.5 mm/s in the X- and Y-directions, respectively. The time duration
for ablation of every sample was 0.50 h. The complete details of fs
laser ablation in liquids were reported in our earlier articles.21,93 After the ablation, the substrates were sonicated and stored in
safest place. The morphology of patterns formed on the crystalline
Si substrates and elemental compositions were characterized by FESEM
[Ultra 55 from Carl ZEISS instrument] technique energy-dispersive
X-ray analysis and Raman spectroscopy using a WITec Alpha 300 spectrometer.

SERS measurements on these substrates were performed by using two
Raman systems. In the case of bulk Raman system, the SERS studies
were performed using a portable Raman spectrometer (B&W Tek, USA)
with a continuous laser operated at a 785 nm wavelength and the laser
power used was 5 mW. The substrates were prepared through drop casting
of Ag/Au NP colloids on ablated Si substrates and incubated for half
an hour to dry the sample at room temperature and, later, analyte
molecules (∼2 μL) were placed on the dried Ag/Au-Si substrates.
The Ag/Au-deposited Si patterned substrates were characterized by
EDAX analysis. In the micro-Raman studies, a WITec Alpha 300 spectrometer
was utilized to perform SERS studies at an excitation wavelength of
532 nm (cw). The SERS-active substrates were then prepared by ion
beam deposition. Ag thin films were deposited on ablated Si substrates
in a home-built ion beam deposition system evacuated by a turbo molecular
pump (TMP). The dc ion source (DC25 Oxford Applied Research, U.K.)
was a Kaufmann-type ion source capable of producing ion beams of 2.5
cm in diameter with a maximum beam energy of 1.5 keV. The ions were
extracted and accelerated by applying a suitable potential to a dual-grid
ion extraction system. Cathode current was maintained at 10 m Amp
with an ion beam energy of 80 eV and an extraction voltage of −40
V. The deposition chamber was evacuated to a base pressure of 2 ×
10–6 Torr before introducing argon gas into the
system. The pressure during deposition was 3 × 10–3 Torr. A 3-in. diameter and 4-mm-thick Ag target was kept at 45°
to the incident ion-beam direction. The substrates were held at room
temperature during deposition, and substrates are mounted on a substrate
holder, which was 8 cm from the target at a 45° angle and in
the source axis. Acceleration voltage, cathode current, deposition
pressure, and extraction voltages were well-calibrated to reach a
deposition rate of 2 nm/min. The deposition was performed for 10 min
to reach ∼20-nm-thick films on all the ablated Si substrates
and was confirmed from the EDAX data.
