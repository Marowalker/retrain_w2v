Forkhead
transcription factor C2 (FOXC2) is a transcription factor
regulating vascular and lymphatic development, and its mutations are
linked to lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome. FOXC2 is also a crucial
regulator of the epithelial–mesenchymal transition processes
essential for tumor metastasis. Here, we report the crystal structure
of the FOXC2–DNA-binding domain in complex with its cognate
DNA. The crystal structure provides the basis of DNA sequence recognition
by FOXC2 for the T/CAAAC motif. Helix 3 makes the majority of the
DNA–protein interactions and confers the DNA sequence specificity.
The computational energy calculation results also validate the structural
observations. The FOXC2 and DNA complex structure provides a detailed
picture of protein and DNA interactions, which allows us to predict
its DNA recognition specificity and impaired functions in mutants
identified in human patients.

Introduction
Forkhead transcription factor C2 (FOXC2,
UniProtKB Q99958) plays essential
roles during vascular endothelial and lymphatic development. Recent
studies have revealed that FOXC2, previously named mesenchymal forkhead
1, is a crucial regulator of epithelial–mesenchymal transition
(EMT) processes.1−3 Epithelial–mesenchymal transition is a transformative
cellular event in which epithelial cells become mesenchymal cells,
characterized by more migratory and multipotent behaviors. In cancer
cells, EMT is closely linked to tumor invasion and metastasis.4 Hence, FOXC2 has gained much interest as a novel
cancer therapeutic target because of its critical roles in EMT processes.1−3,5−7 Notably, FOXC2
has been demonstrated to be abnormally highly expressed in stem cell
populations of breast, colon, esophageal, and prostate cancers, which
are culprits of cancer recurrence, metastasis, and drug resistance.1,6−9 Knockout of FOXC2 has significantly reduced tumor sizes,8 minimized neoplasia,10 and restored epithelial phenotypes sensitive to drugs.9

Forkhead transcription factor C2 belongs
to the forkhead box (FOX)
transcription factor protein family.11 The
FOX family proteins share the forkhead or winged helix structure in
their evolutionary conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD). The FOX proteins
are grouped into 19 subfamilies, with more than 50 FOX proteins having
been identified in humans to date.3,12,13 They play vital roles in development, apoptosis,
metabolism, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and longevity-related
processes,14 and mutations in some FOX
family proteins are linked to severe phenotypic deformity.15 For example, mutations in FOXC2 have been linked
to lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome, a condition characterized by
abnormal lymphatic functions and heart abnormality.16−18

The 501
amino acid long human FOXC2 protein is composed of N- and
C-terminal regulatory domains and the DBD (Figure 1). The evolutionary conserved DBD recognizes
a consensus DNA motif (5′-(G/A)(T/C)(A/C)AA(C/T)A-3′).19 The DBD also contains a predicted nuclear localization
signal (NLS, residues 135–142), less conserved among FOX family
proteins (Figure 1).
Interestingly, the cytoplasmic retention of FOXC2 by nuclear transport
inhibition can prevent the mesenchymal transition of the cells.20 Thus, FOXC2 inhibitors targeting the NLS that
interfere with nuclear transport may serve as potential cancer therapeutics.
The majority of the FOXC2 mutations linked to lymphedema-distichiasis
syndrome are insertion, deletion, and nonsense mutations. Among them,
six identified missense mutations are located in the DBD, underscoring
the functional importance of the DBD (Figure 1).17

FOXC2 DBD is indicated in cyan (helices), red (sheets), and magenta

level). (C) Sequence alignment of the FOX family DNA-binding domains.
The numbering is based on the FOXC2 residues. The secondary structure
elements are indicated, and the missense mutations identified in FOXC2
are also denoted on top of the sequences.

To understand the molecular basis of the pathological mechanisms
of the FOXC2 mutations and to provide the structural basis for cancer
therapeutic development, we have determined a three-dimensional structure
of the FOXC2 DBD in complex with its cognate double-stranded DNA fragment.
Multiple structures of forkhead domains were determined using NMR
and X-ray crystallography methods.21−32 The FOXC2 DBD structure was determined by NMR without the cognate
DNA (PDB ID: 1D5V).27 Without the bound DNA, the structure
exhibits a dynamic nature of the domain in which the C-terminal residues
are disordered. The FOXC2 DBD and DNA complex structure reported here
provides a detailed picture of the protein and DNA interactions. The
structural data combined with quantitative data on the FOXC2 DBD and
various DNA motifs presented here will provide the basis for next-generation
cancer therapeutics targeting FOXC2.

Results and Discussion
Overview
of the FOXC2 DBD–DNA Complex
The structural
study of the FOXC2 bound to the target DNA-containing palindromic
forkhead-binding sites (AAATTGTTTATAAACAGCCCG/TTCGGGCTGTTTATAAACAAT)
was carried out using the human FOXC2 DBD. In solution, the FOXC2
DBD–DNA complexes were readily formed and purified. The expression
construct encodes residues 60–198, but moderate protein degradation
was observed during the purification. The purified complexes were
used for crystallization and structure determination. The crystal
structure of the FOXC2 DBD–DNA complex was solved at the 3.06
Å resolution. The data collection and final refinement statistics
are summarized in Table 1.

One 21 base-pair DNA and 2 molecules of FOXC2 DBD
are present in
an asymmetric unit. The amino acid residues 70–164 in one of
the two FOXC2 DBDs (Mol A) and 73–149 in the second molecule
(Mol B) are modeled into the electron densities (Figure 1). Mol A is stabilized by multiple
crystallographic contacts and displays well-ordered densities. However,
Mol B is involved in fewer crystallographic contacts and is less ordered,
resulting in a poorly defined electron density map (data not shown).
Because of this, the quality of the Mol B model is worse than that
of the Mol A model, and the overall discussion of the FOXC2 DBD is
based on the structure of Mol A. The two FOXC2 DBDs bind to their
respective recognition motifs on the 21-mer DNA double helix and are
related by a 180° rotation symmetry (Figure 1A). However, no direct contacts between the
two protein molecules were observed.

The FOXC2 DBD displays
a canonical winged helix fold composed of
three α-helices (α1–3), three β-strands (β1–3),
and two winglike loops (W1, W2) (Figure 1A). The second winged loop (W2) is disordered
in the previously reported forkhead structures, including the FOXC2
NMR structure (PDB ID: 1D5V).27 In our model, the second
winged loop forms a pseudo-helical conformation with hydrophobic residues
Leu148, Met155, Phe156, and Leu162 packing against the hydrophobic
residues on helix 1 (Figure 1B). The W2 loop in Mol A is involved in multiple crystallographic
contacts, which help to stabilize the conformation. In Mol B, the
C-terminal residues 150–162 are disordered and not included
in the model. This suggests that the second winged motif in the FOXC2
DBD has a flexible nature. The predicted NLS signal (residues 135–142)
is located at the tip of the W1 loop and is highly flexible, making
it easily accessible by the nuclear transport machinery and therapeutic
agents.

While this manuscript was being prepared, crystal structures
of
FOXC2 DBD in complex with DNA motifs, ACAAATA and GTACACA, were reported.33 The protein structure exhibits a similar structural
arrangement as our FOXC2 structure, with the root-mean-square distances
among the Cα atoms ranging between 0.5 and 0.75 Å.

FOXC2 DBD–DNA Interactions
The DNA used for
this structure study contains two forkhead-binding motifs (5′-TATAAACA-3′)
in a palindromic arrangement. Both motifs are bound by the FOXC2 protein
in an identical manner, and interactions between one of the proteins
(Mol A) and the DNA motif are illustrated in Figure 2. Based on the NuProPlot diagram in Figure 2A, Mol A interacts
with residues 12–19 of chain D, TATAAACA, and their complementary
residues.34 Overall, the protein and DNA
interactions are mediated through residues from the helices α1−α3
and wings 1 and 2 of the FOXC2 DBD. Interactions with the DNA bases
were mostly mediated by the residues of helix 3 conferring specificity
for the forkhead-binding motif. The residues from α1–2
and wings 1–2 bind to the backbone of the DNA, stabilizing
the protein–DNA interactions. Lys72, Ser76, and Tyr77 interact
with the DNA backbone near the 5′ region of the TATAAACA motif,
while Asn96 and Tyr99 of α2 contact the DNA backbone in the
3′ end. Residues from the wing 1 region, Lys132, Ser144, Gly143,
and Trp146, also interact with the DNA backbone in the 3′ region.
Arg164 from W2 forms a hydrogen bond with the phosphate group at the
5′ section of the TATAAACA motif (Figure 2A).

Figure 2 FOXC2 DBD and DNA interaction. (A) NuProPlot
diagram of FOXC2 DBD–DNA
interactions. The DNA segment interacting with the Mol A is illustrated.
Hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions are represented by dotted
blue and orange lines, respectively. (B) Detailed view of the FOXC2
DBD and its cognate DNA segment shown in a stereo diagram. The side
chains of amino acid residues involved in the DNA base interactions
are illustrated with the carbons in yellow, the oxygens in red, and
the nitrogens in blue.

The most extensive interactions between the protein and DNA
occur
through helix 3, which sits perpendicularly on a major groove of the
DNA (Figure 2B). Asn118,
Ser119, Arg121, His122, and Ser125 from α3 form protein–base
interactions. The residues are absolutely conserved across the forkhead
family proteins, except at residue Ser119 (Ala in FOXP3) (Figure 1C), and interact
with the canonical forkhead-binding motif. The FOXC2 DBD interacts
with the DNA bases of residues 14–18 (TAAAC) and their complementary
residues. The T14 interacts with Ser119 and His122. The O4 of the
T14 hydrogen-bonds with the Nε2 of the His122 indole
ring, forming a favorable interaction, while the Oγ of the Ser119 is in the range of the van der Waals interaction with
the C7 of the T14. If the T14 is substituted by cytosine, the O4 would
be changed to N4, forming an unfavorable bond with the His122 Nε2. In addition, the C7 would be missing, and interactions
with the Ser119 would be abolished. The His122 also interacts with
A10′ complementary to the T14, and substitution to guanine
at this position will switch the N6 to O6. This change may be favorable
for the interaction with the histidine imidazole ring. Changes to
a purine of the T14, however, will induce conformational changes,
losing any interactions with the Ser119 and His122. Therefore, T or
C at position 14 seems to be favored for interactions with the FOXC2
DBD.

The His122 also forms van der Waals interactions with A15
and its
complementary residue. The Nδ1 of the indole ring
interacts with the N6 group of A15 and the O4 of the complementary
thymine (T9′). If the A–T base pair changes to G–C,
the interactions will still be maintained, but the change of the O4
to N4 in cytosine makes it less favorable for interactions with the
Nδ1. Changes from purine to pyrimidine at this position
are likely to abolish interactions with the H122. The His122 also
determines DNA specificity for A16. The Nδ1 of the
His122 forms a hydrogen bond with the O4 of T8′, complementary
to A16. Changes to cytosine will substitute the O4 with N4 and would
again make the bond less favorable with H122 Nδ1.
Asn118 forms bidentate hydrogen bonds with the A16, making adenine
the most optimal base at this position for protein interaction.

Ser125 exhibits structural complementarity with the T7′
base-pairing with the A17, and changes to any other bases at this
position will eliminate van der Waals interactions at this position.
Arg121 forms a hydrogen bond with the G6′ complementary to
C18. The terminal amide group of Arg121 interacts with the O6 group
of the guanine. Substitution to adenine at this position will change
the O6 to N6, which is less favorable for interaction with Arg121.
In our structure, neither A19 nor the complementary T5′ is
within the 3.8 Å range for interactions with the protein.

Our structural analyses predict that the FOXC2 DBD favors the DNA
motif (T/C)AAACN. To evaluate this prediction quantitatively, we performed
a theoretical energy calculation with base substitutions. We calculated
protein–DNA interaction energies using the program FoldX and
our FOXC2 DBD crystal structure (Table 2).35 The DNA sequences were
mutated at each position, and changes in protein–DNA interaction
energies were calculated after energy minimization of the models.
Overall, the free energy differences with DNA sequence variations
agree with our structural analyses. Of the TAAACA sequence, the first
T to C change did not demonstrate notable differences. All of the
other changes resulted in mostly unfavorable interactions, except
for the last adenine, which can be changed to any other bases without
a significant energy cost. Based on our analyses, the DNA motif (T/C)AAACN
is predicted to be the optimal sequence for binding with FOXC2.

We measured the binding affinity
of the FOXC2 DBD to the DNA-containing
TATAAACA motif using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).
The FOXC2 DBD exhibits an overall low affinity to its cognate DNA
with the Kd value of 26 μM (Figure 3). The Kd values between FOXC2 and various DNA motifs have previously
been measured using isothermal calorimetry, and their ranges are 0.79
μM for GTAAACA, 2.22 μM for GTACACA, and 100 μM
for ACAAATA.33 The measured Kd value indicates more than 30-fold differences between
TATAAACA and GTAAACA, which contains the core TAAACA motif. This may
be due to differences in the DNA sequences and the techniques employed
in the binding affinity measurement. Nonetheless, our computational
data predict that the FOXC2 prefers TAAACA over TACACA, and CAAATA
seems to be the least favored (Table 2). This result is in agreement with the isothermal
calorimetry measurement data.33 This indicates
that crystal structures of transcription factors combined with computational
approaches can be a credible tool for DNA specificity determination.

FOXC2 DBD, 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 150, and 300 μM, were
used (lanes 1–9). (B) Linear scale saturation binding curve

(95% CI: 18.7–37 μM) and 0.94, respectively. The error

experiments.

FOXC2 Mutations in Lymphedema-Distichiasis
Syndrome
Several missense mutations in the FOXC2 DBD are
associated with pathogenic
conditions in humans (Figure 1C). They are linked to the familial and sporadic lymphedema-distichiasis
syndrome, a condition characterized by abnormal lymphatic functions,
spinal cysts, and heart abnormality.16−18,36−38 To understand the effect of these mutations on DNA
binding and protein stability, free energy differences of missense
mutants from the wild type were calculated and compared.39 The mutant models were generated based on our
FOXC2 DBD–DNA crystal structure, energy-minimized, and used
for the calculation. Free energies of intraprotein interaction and
protein–DNA interaction were computed, and the ΔGs from the wild type were calculated. Solvent molecules
were not included in the calculation for the sake of simplicity. Table 3 presents the calculated
ΔGs in the mutants.

As described previously, in the crystal structure,
the side chains
of Asn118, Arg121, and Ser125 make direct contacts with the DNA and
are responsible for the DNA sequence specificity (Figure 4). Therefore, the mutations,
N118K, R121C, R121H, and S125L, are expected to impact DNA binding. Figure 4 illustrates that
the N118K mutation is likely to remove the hydrogen bonds to A16 (Figure 4A), and changes to
cysteine or histidine from Arg121 are also predicted to remove multiple
bonds to the DNA (Figure 4B). S125L mutation, however, seems to cause steric clashes
with the DNA (Figure 4C). The energy calculation results also indicate an increase in the
ΔGs of the protein–DNA interactions
in the mutants (Table 3).

Figure 4 Comparisons of wild type and FOXC2 missense mutants. Models of
wild type, N118K (A), R121H (B), and S125L (C), are depicted in the
stick representation. Dotted lines represent hydrogen bonds, and in
panel (C), the clash among the atoms is illustrated.

The two other reported missense mutations in lymphedema-distichiasis
patients, I85N and W116R, are not located at the DNA-binding interface.
These residues seem to contribute to stabilizing the hydrophobic interactions
in the protein core. Changes to polar amino acids at this position
are likely to affect protein folding. Disruption of the intraprotein
interactions results in higher free energy in these mutants compared
to that in the wild type (Table 3).

Protein–Protein Interactions
The FOXC2 DBD exhibits
low affinity to its cognate DNA, with a micromolar range of the Kd values (Figure 3).33 The FOXC2 was reported
to interact with various transcription factors and co-occupy promotor
and enhancer sequences.40 The FOXC2 alone
exhibits low affinity, but interactions with other proteins are an
essential driving force for DNA interaction. Among the binding partners,
the E-twenty-six (ETS) family proteins were reported to physically
interact with the FOXC2 and synergistically activate downstream targets.40 In zebrafish, FOXC2 together with ETS variant
2 (ETV2, UniProtKB Q30JB6) transcription factors control angiogenetic processes,
and the two proteins are required for blood vessel formation.40 One of the downstream targets activated by FOXC2
and ETV2 is the myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C, UniProtKB Q06413). MEF2C
is an endothelial-specific transcription factor, and the enhancer
sequences co-occupied by FOXC2 and ETV2 have been identified.40 We built a composite model of FOXC2 and ETV2
(UniProtKB O00321) DNA-binding domains bound to the FOX–ETS motif in the Mef2c
enhancer sequence, based on the FOXO1 and ETS cocrystal structure
(RCSB 4LG0).41 We generated the FOXC2–ETV2
complex model using the FOXC2 DBD crystal structure and an ETV2 model.
The ETV2 model was generated by homology modeling, using the ETS1
as a template.41,42

Figure 5 illustrates the composite model of FOXC2
and ETV2 bound to the DNA. The ternary complex model indicates that
no extensive interactions are present between the two proteins. However,
the Lys113 of FOXC2 is positioned at the interface close to the Glu293
of ETV2, suggesting a potential interaction between the two factors.
In our current composite model, the distance between the two residues
is 5.6 Å. With that distance, direct contact would not be possible;
however, the two residues are in the range for solvent-mediated interactions.
The Glu293 is absolutely conserved among the ETS proteins, but its
function remains unclear. The Lys113 of FOXC2 is located in the loop
between the 310-helix and Helix 3. This loop is involved
in neither DNA interactions nor protein core stabilization. The amino
acid sequence of the loop is not highly conserved, but most forkhead
proteins contain a basic amino acid in this loop. The conserved nature
of the two binding partners implies a possible role for the two amino
acids in protein–protein interactions. A similar intermolecular
interaction has been observed between the cardiac transcription factors,
NKX2.5 and TBX5.43 The ternary complex
structure of NKX2.5 and TBX5 with the target DNA revealed physical
interactions between the two proteins via salt bridges between the
Lys and the Asp, highly conserved in TBX and NKX families across species.
Except for the potential salt bridge, the FOXC2 and ETV2 models do
not show extensive interfaces between the two DNA-binding domains.
This implies that the major protein–protein interactions are
mediated by the N- or C-terminal domains outside of the DNA-binding
domains.

Figure 5 Composite model of FOXC2 and ETV2 bound to a DNA target. A ternary
complex of FOXC2 and ETV2 bound to a FOX–ETS motif is illustrated.
The FOXC2 follows the same color scheme as in Figure 1A, and ETV2 is indicated in green (helices),
blue (sheets), and yellow (coils). The FOX–ETS DNA is illustrated
in the cartoon representation. Two charged residues at the interface,
Lys113 of FOXC2 and Glu293 of ETV2, are labeled.

Conclusions
We report the crystal structure of the
FOXC2–DNA-binding
domain in complex with its cognate DNA. The structure provides the
basis for specificity of protein and DNA interactions. As in previously
reported forkhead protein structures, the helix α3 forms the
majority of the DNA–protein interactions and provides its DNA
sequence specificity. Additional contacts to the DNA backbone by residues
outside of helix 3 seem to stabilize the protein–DNA interactions.
Furthermore, this structure provides the structural foundation that
allows us to predict disruptions in the protein–DNA binding
caused by pathological mutations identified in FOXC2 proteins.

Materials
and Methods
Cloning of the FOXC2 DBD expression constructs
and purification
of the proteins were previously reported.10 The DNA encoding the human FOXC2 protein (amino acid residues 60–198)
was inserted between the Nde I and EcoR I sites of a modified pET28b
plasmid containing an N-terminal six histidine and a maltose-binding
protein tag, cleavable using tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease. For
protein expression, Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3)-RIPL cells were transformed with the FOXC2 DBD expression
construct and grown in Luria broth. Protein expression was induced
with 0.8 mM of β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h
at 37 °C.

The FOXC2 DBD protein was purified using a standard
affinity chromatography
method. First, cells were lysed by sonicating for 4 min in 50 mM Tris–HCl
pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol (v/w), 2 mM MgCl2, and
2 mM β-mercaptoethanol (BME). A protease inhibitor cocktail
tablet (Roche Life Science) and 0.2% polyethyleneimine were added
to the lysed sample. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation
at 35 000g for 30 min and applied to cobalt-charged
sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). The protein was eluted with 750 mM
imidazole. To remove the bulky fusion tag, the eluted fractions were
incubated with TEV protease during an overnight dialysis step against
a buffer composed of 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.0), 100 mM NaCl,
12% glycerol (v/w), 2 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM BME at 4 °C.
The protein was further purified by cation exchange chromatography
using a Hi-Trap SP HP column (GE Healthcare). The cleaved proteins
were eluted by a linear NaCl gradient from 50 mM to 1 M at pH 7.0.

The oligonucleotides for cocrystallization experiments were synthesized
(Sigma Genosys) and annealed in 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and
10 mM MgCl2, first by heating the solution to 95 °C
for 10 min and then cooling down slowly to room temperature in a water
bath.

For the protein–DNA complex purification, the double-stranded
DNA and the purified FOXC2 DBD protein were mixed roughly in the molar
ratio of 1:1.5. The protein–DNA complex was purified by size-exclusion
chromatography using a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) in a gel
filtration buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.0, 0.15 M NaCl, 2 mM
BME, and 5% glycerol. The purified ternary complex was analyzed by
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, concentrated
to the final protein concentration of 10 mg/mL, and stored at −80
°C.

Crystallization, X-ray Data Collection, and Structure Determination
For crystallization, the purified complex of FOXC2–DNA was
screened by the sparse matrix with crystallization drops containing
1 μL of protein–DNA sample and 1 μL of crystallization
solution at room temperature. Plate-shaped crystals were obtained
from well solutions containing 100 mM sodium acetate pH 4.6, 200 mM
(NH4)2SO4, 25% w/v poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) 2000 monomethyl ether (MME), and 10 mM BME. For data
collection, the FOXC2 DBD–DNA crystals were cryoprotected in
100 mM sodium acetate pH 4.6, 200 mM (NH4)2SO4, 25% w/v PEG 2000 MME, 10 mM BME, and 30% glycerol and flash-frozen
in liquid nitrogen.

The thin plate-shaped crystals of the FOXC2–DNA
complex diffracted to 3.06 Å resolution at APS 19-ID beamline
in Argonne National Laboratory synchrotron sources. The crystal belongs
to the monoclinic C2 space group. Based on the unit
cell dimensions and the molecular mass of the FOXC2 DBD/DNA complex,
2 DBD domains and a 21 bp double-stranded DNA were expected in an
asymmetric unit with a solvent content of 60% (VM = 2.74 Å3/Da).44 The structure was determined by molecular replacement using the
program Phaser45 and the crystal structure
of the FOXA2 (PDB ID: 5X07) as a search model.46,47 The initial
search revealed one unambiguous solution for the FOXC2–DNA
complex. When the model was positioned in a unit cell, densities for
the full DNA and the additional FOXC2 were visible. Subsequent iterative
rounds of structural refinement were carried out using the PHENIX
suite, followed by manual rebuilding using the program COOT.45,48,49 The final model was validated
using Molprobity.50

Electrophoretic Mobility
Shift Assay (EMSA)
The electrophoretic
mobility shift assay was performed using gradient concentrations of
purified FOXC2 DBD with a 16 bp DNA (caaggTAAACAaacca) containing
the consensus motif on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel. The FOXC2 DBD
was first diluted with a gel filtration buffer to the final concentrations
of 0, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 150, 300, and 600 μM. For the EMSA
sample preparation, 1 μM DNA and EMSA buffer containing 50 mM
Tris pH 7.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM BME, 5% glycerol,
and 10 μg/mL BSA were used. Five microliters of the protein
sample were first premixed with 1 μL of DNA and 4 μL of
EMSA buffer and incubated on ice for 20 min. The mixed samples were
electrophoresed on an equilibrated native gel for 35 min and stained
with SYBR Green from the EMSA kit (Invitrogen). The intensity measurement
of the signals was performed using ImageJ.51

Calculation of Intraprotein and Protein–DNA Interaction
Energies
Six FOXC2 mutants, I85N, W116R, N118K, R121C, R121H,
and S125L, were modeled based on the FOXC2–DNA structure using
the program COOT.49 The wild type and the
mutant models were energy-minimized, and the intraprotein and protein–DNA
interaction energies were calculated using the program FoldX.35
