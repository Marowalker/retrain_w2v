Natural
products have extensively contributed toward the discovery
of new leads for Alzheimer’s disease. During our search for
new inhibitors of cholinesterase enzymes from natural sources, the
ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract of Rumex abyssinicus Jacq was identified as a dual cholinesterase inhibitor with IC50 values of 2.7 and 11.4 μg/mL against acetylcholinesterase
(AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), respectively. The phytochemical
investigation of the EtOAc extract has resulted in isolation of four
anthraquinones, namely, helminthosporin, emodin, chrysophanol, and
physcion, amongst which the helminthosporin has been isolated for
the first time from Rumex sp. All isolated
secondary metabolites have displayed significant inhibition of EeAChE
with IC50 values of 2.63, 15.21, 33.7, and 12.16 μM,
respectively. In addition, the helminthosporin was also found to inhibit
BChE with an IC50 value of 2.99 μM. The enzyme kinetic
study has indicated that helminthosporin inhibits AChE and BChE in
a noncompetitive manner with ki values
of 10.3 and 12.3 μM, respectively. The results of molecular
modeling and propidium iodide displacement assay have revealed that
helminthosporin occupies the peripheral anionic site of the active
site gorge of AChE. In the PAMPA-BBB permeability assay, helminthosporin
was found to possess high BBB permeability (Pe = 6.16 × 10–6 cm/s). In a nutshell,
helminthosporin has been identified as a brain permeable dual cholinesterase
inhibitor, and thus its further synthetic exploration is warranted
for optimization of its potency.

Introduction
The genus Rumex (family: Polygonaceae)
is widely distributed worldwide, and its many species have nutritional
and medicinal properties.1 The Rumex abyssinicus Jacq. (synonyms: Rumex schimperi Meisn. and Acetosa
abyssinica Jacq.) is a flowering plant (family: Polygonaceae)
native to tropical Africa and is often used in African traditional
medicine for various purposes including treating jaundice and related
liver diseases, stomachache, neckache, low blood pressure, pneumonia,
wound healing, and in rheumatism.2,3 The plant extracts
possess antimicrobial,4 anti-inflammatory,4,5 cancer chemopreventive,6 diuretic, analgesic,7 wound healing,5 anticancer,8 and antioxidant activities.9 However, the plant has never been investigated for its
anti-Alzheimer’s potential.

Natural products (NPs) have
immensely contributed in the discovery
of central nervous system (CNS)-active agents.10 The contribution of NPs for Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) is huge, and among the four currently available anti-Alzheimer’s
drugs, two are NP scaffolds viz. rivastigmine and galantamine. Although
numerous cholinesterase inhibitors have been reported, the search
for new compounds is a continuing process. Based on the understanding
of the role of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in late stage AD, it has
now been hypothesized that dual cholinesterase inhibitors would be
beneficial rather than only acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor.
As a part of our efforts in this area,11,12 herein we
have investigated the potential of the African medicinal plant R. abyssinicus Jacq. and its secondary metabolites
for anticholinesterase potential. The detailed mechanistic investigation
followed by molecular modeling studies were carried out to understand
the mechanism and mode of cholinesterase inhibition by the most active
secondary metabolite.

Results
In Vitro Inhibition of
Cholinesterase Enzymes by R. abyssinicus Jacq
As a part of our interest
to discover new dual cholinesterase inhibitors, the ethyl acetate
(EtOAc) extract of rhizomes of R. abyssinicus Jacq (RAE) was screened for inhibition of EeAChE and eqBChE. Initial
screening was performed at 10 and 100 μg/mL (results are shown
in Figure 1). At 100
μg/mL, RAE displayed 91 and 93% inhibition of EeAChE and eqBChE
enzymes. The extract RAE also displayed potent inhibition (73 and
50%) of both enzymes even at 10 μg/mL. The IC50 values
of RAE for inhibition of these enzymes were found to be 2.7 ±
0.43 and 11.43 ± 1.23 μg/mL, respectively. The interesting
activity profile of RAE against both cholinesterases prompted us to
proceed for phytochemical investigation, to dig-out the secondary
metabolites responsible for this activity.

Phytochemical Investigation of R. abyssinicus Extract
The extract was subjected
to isolation of secondary
metabolites using traditional column chromatography, which resulted
in isolation of four compounds RAE-1, 2, 3, and 4. The 1H NMR of RAE-1 has shown three characteristic H-bonded −OH
peaks at chemical shift values of δ 11.3, 11.9, and 12.0 ppm,
indicating the presence of three pairs of −OH and carbonyl
groups in a pattern of 1,3-position. Further, the signals in the region
δ 7.47–6.58 ppm of the 1H NMR spectrum with
integration for four protons have indicated the presence of four aromatic
protons. The singlet at δ 2.4 ppm confirmed the presence of
aromatic −CH3 group. The 13C NMR of RAE-1
have shown two peaks at δ 190.1 and 181.8 ppm accounting for
the presence of two −CO groups in the structure of RAE-1. The
presence of three signals at δ 165.9, 164.9, and 161.8 indicated
the presence of three OH groups on the aromatic ring. The signal at
δ 22.0 ppm confirmed the presence of aromatic methyl groups.
The ESI-MS (negative mode) spectrum has shown the [M – H]− peak at m/z 269.25
indicating the possible mass of RAE-1 as 270 Da. The combined information
from NMR and MS data concluded the identity of RAE-1 as helminthosporin.
Further, the obtained spectral data was well corroborated with the
literature values.13 The NMR spectra of
other three compounds RAE-2, RAE-3, and RAE-4 also showed similar
characteristic peaks of the anthraquinone scaffold. Based on 1H, 13C NMR, and MS data and further their comparison
with literature values, they were identified as emodin, chrysophanol,
and physcion, respectively. The chemical structures of isolated secondary
metabolites are shown in Figure 1.

In Vitro Inhibition of Cholinesterase Enzymes
by Isolated Secondary
Metabolites
All four anthraquinones were tested for cholinesterase
inhibitory activity against both enzymes, initially at 10 and 100
μM concentrations. Results are shown in Figure 1. It was observed that helminthosporin was
the most active among these four compounds, against both enzymes.
Determination of IC50 values has revealed that helminthosporin
inhibits EeAChE with an IC50 value of 2.7 μM, and
eqBChE with an IC50 value of 2.99 μM. The IC50 of helminthosporin for inhibition of recombinant human AChE
was also determined and was found to be 7.9 ± 0.14 μM.
The representative dose–response curve for IC50 determination
has been shown in Figure 2. Other three anthraquinones, namely, emodin, chrysophanol,
and physcion were moderately active against AChE (IC50 values
of 15, 34, and 12 μM, respectively) and were weakly active against
BChE (Table 1).

AChE by helminthosporin (IC50 was determined using 8 different
concentrations of the test compound).

Helminthosporin was then studied for enzyme kinetics
to understand
the mechanism of cholinesterase inhibition. The analysis of the Lineweaver–Burk
plot (Figure 3A) has
indicated that helminthosporin is a noncompetitive inhibitor of human
AChE with a ki value of 10.3 μM.
Similarly, it showed inhibition of eqBChE in a noncompetitive mode
with a ki value of 12.3 μM. Further,
our study has shown that the clinically used cholinesterase inhibitor
donepezil is also a noncompetitive inhibitor of AChE and BChE with ki values of 0.0214 (lit. 0.016)14 and 15 (lit. 1.6)14 μM,
respectively. The Lineweaver–Burk plots of helminthosporin
and donepezil for inhibition of AChE and BChE are shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. The kinetic study has shown that the Michaelis
constant (Km) value does not change with
the change in inhibitor concentration in case of helminthosporin (Figure 3C,F) as well as donepezil
(Figure 4C,F); however,
the reaction rate (Vmax) was found to
be decreased with the increase in inhibitor concentration (Figures 3C,F and 4C,F). This is the typical case of noncompetitive
inhibition.

Next, the in silico docking studies were conducted to explore the
binding site of helminthoporin in human AChE (PDB: 4EY7) and human BChE
(PDB: 6EP4)
using Glide module of Schrodinger molecular modelling software. The
docking investigation demonstrated that helminthosporin accommodates
well in the active site gorge of both enzymes, interacting mainly
with the amino acids residues of peripheral anionic site (PAS) domain
(Figure 5). The in
silico studies are advocating that the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase
is likely to be attributed to the various hydrophobic interactions
of helminthosporin with the amino acid residues of PAS. As depicted
in Figure 5A, the molecule
stays at PAS, and does not enter deep into the active site gorge to
interact with catalytic anionic site (CAS) residues. The dihydroxy
aryl ring of helminthosporin (ring C) displays π–π
stacking interactions with the TRP 286 and the −OH group displays
H-bonding interactions with SER 293 and ARG 296 residues of AChE (Figure 5B). The carbonyl
oxygen of the central quinone ring displays H-bonding interactions
with PHE 295 and ARG 296. Helminthosporin also occupies the active
site of the BChE (Figure 5C–D). In this case also, the molecule stays at the
entrance of the cavity and further it was noticed that it orients
in an angular way rather than a vertical orientation. This could be
because of the wider opening of the BChE active site gorge. The hydroxyl
group of ring C shows H-bonding interaction with SER 287 of the mouth
of the BChE gorge. Similarly, the carbonyl oxygen of the central quinone
ring displayed H-bonding with ASN 289 of the gorge mouth. The hydroxyl
of the tolyl ring (ring A) also displayed H-bonding with GLY 116 (a
residue of the oxyanion hole) and the same ring also showed π–π
stacking interaction with TYR 332 residue of PAS of BChE (Figure 5D). Unlike helminthosporin,
donepezil was found to span across the active site gorge of both AChE
and BChE because of its extra length. It shows interactions with PAS
as well as CAS residues; however, its noncompetitive mode of inhibition
for both enzymes must be accounted for its interactions with PAS residues.
The overlay images of donepezil with helminthosporin are displayed
in Figure 5E–F.

and donepezil (orange) in the active site gorge of BChE.

The molecular modeling studies have indicated that helminthosporin
primarily interacts with PAS residues. Therefore, the affinity of
helminthosporin for the PAS binding site was assessed by displacement
of propidium iodide, an AChE ligand that specifically binds at its
PAS binding site and enhances its fluorescence intensity up to eight
fold after binding to AChE.15 The decrease
in fluorescence intensity was taken as a measure of displacement of
propidium iodide by the compound and thus its affinity for PAS. Helminthosporin
and donepezil were analyzed at 10 and 50 μM test concentrations.
Helminthosporin displayed propidium iodide displacement by 35.9 and
69.2%, respectively, at 10 and 50 μM test concentrations. Whereas,
donepezil has shown 20.8 and 29.2% displacement at 10 and 50 μM,
respectively. These results supported the docking study results, that
is, interactions of helminthosporin with the residues of the PAS binding
site, and thus supporting the noncompetitive mode of inhibition.

ADME Properties of Helminthosporin
The drug-like/ADME
properties of any new lead compound must be evaluated at the early
discovery stage. The parameters associated with membrane permeability
of the compound were assessed computationally using the QikProp module
of Schrodinger molecular modeling software. The computed log P, log S, Caco-2 permeability, and MDCK
permeability values were found within an acceptable range (Table 2). The BBB permeability
has been considered as one of the most important criterion for CNS
drugs. Therefore, BBB permeability was determined for helminthosporin,
both by computational methods as well as via experimental methods.
The computed log BB value was found to be within the acceptable limit.
To understand whether the helminthosporin could penetrate into the
brain, the parallel artificial membrane permeation assay for BBB (PAMPA-BBB)
was used, which has shown its Pe value
as 6.16 × 10–6 cm/s. The computed ADME parameters,
experimentally determined BBB permeability, and the summary of enzyme
kinetics and molecular modeling of helminthosporin and donepezil have
been shown in Table 2.

Discussion
The dual inhibition of both the cholinesterase
enzymes has been
believed to be beneficial over inhibition of only one of the cholinesterase
enzymes. The identification of a NP-based new scaffold has a special
importance in the CNS domain. The activity-guided isolation of bioactive
secondary metabolites has been one of the successful approaches to
discover new NP inhibitors.16−18 Employing this approach, Choi
and co-workers19 have reported the cholinesterase
inhibition activity of 16 anthraquinones. Their results have shown
that anthraquinones display a better activity profile against AChE
in comparison to BChE. Emodin (AChE, IC50: 21.8;20 9.17 μM),19 chrysophanol (AChE, IC50: 75.8;20 68.6 μM),19 and physcion (AChE,
IC50: 8.25 μM)19 were
reported as cholinesterase inhibitors. In the present work, as a part
of our campaign toward discovery of plant based new anti-AD lead candidates,
the R. abyssinicus extract was found
to show promising inhibition of AChE as well as BChE. The bioassay-guided
isolation has resulted in isolation of four anthraquinones, namely,
helminthosporin, emodin, chrysophanol, and physcion. Literature reports
have indicated that many species of Rumex are reported to produce anthraquinones. Emodin, chrysophanol, and
physcion were previously reported
from R. abyssinicus;21−24 however, it is noteworthy to
mention that helminthosporin is being isolated for the first time
from Rumex sp. Previously, helminthosporin
has been reported from marine fungus Aspergillus glaucus(25) and from the plant Eremurus
persicus.13 The anticholinesterase
activity of helminthosporin is also being reported for the first time.

Majority of natural anthraquinones bear hydroxyl groups at C-1
or C-8 or at both positions. Emodin is the most widely investigated
natural anthraquinone which possess −OH group at both C-1 and
C-8 positions. Interestingly, all four isolated anthraquinones along
with several other anthraquinones which were studied for cholinesterase
inhibition bear a −OH group at 1,8-positions and a methyl group
at C-3 position. Apart from 1,8-hydroxy groups, emodin bears additional-OH
groups at the C-6 position. From the available cholinesterase inhibition
data on anthraquinones, it was observed that the manipulation of the
C6–OH group modulates the AChE inhibition activity. The replacement
of C6–OH with another electron-donating group such as −OMe
(e.g., physcion) does not affect the activity; however, removal of
the C6–OH group has resulted in twofold decrease in activity
(e.g., chrysophanol). When the C6–OH group was migrated to
adjacent C5-carbon (e.g., helminthosporin) creating another (C5,C10)-keto-enol
tautomer in the anthraquinone skeleton which positively modulated
the activity. On addition of the fourth −OH group in the emodin
skeleton (e.g., alternin), the activity was improved. The disturbance
to the keto–enol tautomer (e.g., obtusin) has resulted in significant
loss in activity. From these observations, it can be concluded that
the presence of two or more keto–enol tautomers in the anthraquinone
scaffold is important for anti-AChE activity; and the C6–OH
group can be manipulated/migrated to further fine-tune the activity.
The schematic view of the structure–activity relationship is
depicted in Figure 6. The molecular modeling studies have shown that the additional keto–enol
tautomer (C5–OH, C10–CO) present in helminthosporin
display bindentage H-bonding interaction with ARG 296, and also it
interacts with SER 293 and PHE 295 residues via H-bonding. These interactions
could be accounted for stronger binding of helminthosporin with the
enzyme and thus better activity over other anthraquinones.

relationship of anthraquinones for AChE
inhibition. The AChE inhibition data of obtusin and alternin has been
taken from Jung et al.19

The active site gorge of both cholinesterases is deep with
about
20 Å length, wherein the catalytic site is located at the bottom
of the gorge (∼4 Å above the base of gorge). Within the
gorge, there exists two distinct sites, the CAS and PAS. For inhibitors
to competitively bind to the enzyme, it has to enter deep into the
cavity to interact with the catalytic triad. The PAS is located at
the entrance of the gorge and is known to allosterically modulate
the enzyme activity. Donepezil which is a clinically used AChE inhibitor,
spans in the entire active site gorge and thereby interacts with both
CAS and PAS residues. However, the mode of inhibition of donepezil
is noncompetitive with a ki value of 21.4
nM (AChE). Helminthosporin is a shorter molecule and is found to stay
at the mouth of the gorge, showing interactions only with the PAS.
Helminthosporin was also able to displace the PAS binding ligand propidium
iodide, indicating that PAS is its primary binding site. The binding
affinity of the helminthosporin was found to be in the range of 10–13
μM. The binding affinity (ki) is
indicative of the affinity of the inhibitor with the enzyme, which
thereby indicates the effectiveness of the inhibitor.

Although
helminthosporin has a log P value of
1.6 which is primarily because of three polar −OH groups, its
tricyclic flat structure imparts enough lipophilicity to the structure,
allowing it to cross BBB easily. Wang and co-workers have mentioned
that the permeability values over 3.3 × 10–6 cm/s would be able to cross the BBB.26 The Pe value of helminthosporin was
found to be 6.16 × 10–6 cm/s, indicating that
it falls under the high CNS permeability window. In summary, the newly
identified dual ChE inhibitor has excellent BBB permeability and thus
has a potential for further medicinal chemistry lead optimization/preclinical
investigation.

Conclusions
In summary, herein we
report the R. abyssinicus plant extract
and its isolated secondary metabolite “helminthosporin”
as dual inhibitors of AChE and BChE enzymes, which are vital players
responsible for cholinergic loss in Alzheimer’s patients. Helminthosporin
binds to the PAS of the active site gorge of AChE in a noncompetitive
mode. The anti-Alzheimer’s activity of the R.
abyssinicus plant and helminthosporin has been reported
for the first time, and its structure has further potential for lead
optimization.

Material and Methods
General
All solvents
used in the present study were
obtained from CDH chemicals, Sigma-Aldrich and were used as received. 1H, 13C, and DEPT NMR spectra were recorded on Brucker-Avance
DPX FT-NMR 500 and 400 MHz instruments. 13C NMR spectra
were recorded at 125 MHz or 100 MHz. ESI-MS spectra were recorded
on an Agilent 1100 LC-Q-TOF machine. Melting points were recorded
on a digital melting point apparatus (make: Buchi M-560).

Plant Material
R. abyssinicus Jacq (family: Polygonaceae)
was collected from Fongo-Tongo, West
region of Cameroon and was identified by Fubert Tadjouteu of the National
Herbarium of Cameroon (NHC), where the voucher specimen has been deposited
(no. N°50551/NHC). The rhizomes were washed with water, sliced
into small pieces, and dried in an oven at 45 °C. Thereafter,
they were crushed and the obtained powder was used for extraction.

Extraction of R. abyssinicus Jacq
Rhizomes
The powder of R. abyssinicus Jacq was extracted in Laboratory of Microbiology and Antimicrobial
Substances (LAMAS) of Biochemistry Department, University of Dschang,
Cameroon. Three hundred grams of the powder was macerated in 9 L of
EtOAc for 72 h. The extract was filtered using a Whatman filter paper
and the obtained filtrate was evaporated using a rotavapor to dryness
to get 42 g of the EtOAc extract (RAE; extractive value, 14% w/w).

Isolation of Secondary Metabolites
18.6 g of the EtOAc
extract was loaded on a silica gel (100–200 mesh) column and
was eluted with hexane/EtOAc as a solvent system in a gradient fashion
starting from 0 to 100% EtOAc/n-hexane. Fractions
of 200 mL were collected and were pooled into 30 different fractions
based on thin-layer chromatography analysis. Two pure compounds RAE-1
and RAE-2 were isolated in pure form (1.4 and 1.3 g, respectively)
from the first two fractions, when the column was eluted only with n-hexane. Two fractions containing the mixture of compounds
were further subjected to column chromatography. Fraction 3 (564 mg)
was subjected to a second column (100–200 mesh) which resulted
in isolation of orange crystals of another pure compound RAE-3 (60
mg). Fraction 4 (654 mg) on second column chromatography (100–200
mesh) yielded the fourth pure compound as a yellow powder, which has
been coded as RAE-4 (150 mg). All isolated compounds were characterized
by comparison of their spectral data with literature values.27

In Vitro
AChE and BChE Inhibition Assay
Enzymes and Reagents
The cholinesterase enzymes viz. Electrophorus electricus AChE (EC 3.1.1.7, from electric
eel, 1256 U/mg of protein), recombinant human AChE (EC 3.1.1.7, recombinant,
expressed in HEK 293 cells, ≥1000 units/mg protein), and butyrylcholinesterase
(BChE, E.C. 3.1.1.8, from equine serum, 855 U/mg protein) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. The reagents required in the assay viz. 5,5-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic
acid) (DTNB), acetylthiocholine iodide (ATChI), S-butyrylthiocholine iodide (BTChI), and reference standard donepezil
hydrochloride were also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Ellman Assay
The inhibitory capacity of RAE, isolated
secondary metabolites (helminthosporin, emodin, chrysophanol, and
physcion), and positive control donepezil hydrochloride on EeAChE
and eqBChE was determined using modified Ellman assay,32 as described in our earlier publications.11,12 Briefly, the mixture of the test sample (20 μL), enzyme solution
(20 μL of 2.5 units/mL enzyme activity), and DTNB solution (140
μL of 0.3 mM) was incubated in a 96-well plate at 25 °C
for 20 min. Then, ATChI solution (20 μL of 10 mM) was added
and the absorbance was recorded at 412 nm using a 96-well microplate
plate reader. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. The intensity
of the color (or absorbance) is directly proportional to the enzyme
activity. For determination of IC50 values, eight different
concentrations of the test sample were used and the value was obtained
using GraphPad Prism software.

The kinetic analysis of helminthosporin
(along with donepezil) with rHuAChE, and eqBChE was performed using
five different concentrations of the substrate (0.0625–1 mM)
for different concentrations of helminthosporin/donepezil. The type
of inhibition was determined from a Lineweaver–Burk double
reciprocal plot, as described in our previous publications.11,12

Propidium Iodide Competition Assay
Propidium iodide
is a substrate which specifically binds to PAS of AChE. The competitive
displacement of propidium iodide by test compounds can be taken as
a measure of binding of compounds at the PAS. 150 μL of 10 and
50 μM concentrations of test compounds were incubated with 5U
of EeAChE for 6 h at 25 °C. The propidium iodide (50 μL,
1 μM) was added and the assay mixture was further incubated
for 10 min. The background signal was measured in control wells containing
all reagents except EeAChE. The fluorometer was set on a well plate
reader mode with excitation at 535 nm and emission at 595 nm, respectively,
and the fluorescence intensities were measured. Each concentration
was assayed in triplicate. Background signal was subtracted from all
the readings. The percentage inhibition was calculated using the following
formula: 100 – (IFi/IF0 × 100),
where IFi and IF0 are the fluorescence intensities
with and without inhibitor, respectively.15

In Vitro PAMPA-BBB Assay
The test compound was dissolved
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 10 mM concentration, and was further
diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer (pH 7.4) to 100
μM. The filter membrane of the donor plate was coated with PBL
in dodecane (selected empirically as 4 μL volume of 20 mg/mL
PBL in dodecane). To this plate was added, 0.2 mL of test compound
solution. The acceptor plate was also filled with 0.2 mL of PBS buffer
(pH 7.4), and it was carefully put below the donor plate to form a
“sandwich”. The plate was kept at 25 °C, for 18
h. The concentration of drug in the acceptor, the donor, and the reference
wells was determined using a UV plate reader. The effective permeability
(Pe) of the compound was calculated by
using the following equation.33  where, C = (VD × VA)/(VD
+ VA) × area × time.

Molecular Modelling
The crystal structure of human
AChE (PDB ID: 4EY7)34 and human BChE (PDB ID: 6EP4)35 was retrieved from the protein data bank and was used for
molecular modeling studies under default settings from Glide. The
docking was performed as described earlier.11,12 The ADME properties were calculated using the QikProp module present
within the Maestro program.
