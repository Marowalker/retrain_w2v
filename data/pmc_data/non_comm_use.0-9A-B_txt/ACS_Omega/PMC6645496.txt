The hedgehog (Hh) pathway plays a
central role in the development
and repair of our bodies. Therefore, dysregulation of the Hh pathway
is responsible for many developmental diseases and cancers. Basal
cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma have well-established links to
the Hh pathway, as well as many other cancers with Hh-dysregulated
subtypes. A smoothened (SMO) receptor plays a central role in regulating
the Hh signaling in the cells. However, the complexities of the receptor
structural mechanism of action and other pathway members make it difficult
to find Hh pathway inhibitors efficient in a wide range. Recent crystal
structure of SMO with cholesterol indicates that it may be a natural
ligand for SMO activation. Structural similarity of fluorinated corticosterone
derivatives to cholesterol motivated us to study the effect of dexamethasone,
fludrocortisone, and corticosterone on the Hh pathway activity. We
identified an inhibitory effect of these three drugs on the Hh pathway
using a functional assay in NIH3T3 glioma response element cells.
Studies using BODIPY-cyclopamine and 20(S)-hydroxy cholesterol [20(S)-OHC]
as competitors for the transmembrane (TM) and extracellular cysteine-rich
domain (CRD) binding sites showed a non-competitive effect and suggested
an alternative or allosteric binding site for the three drugs. Furthermore,
the three steroids showed an additive effect on Hh pathway inhibition
when tested in combination with cyclopamine. Our study reports the
antagonistic effect of dexamethasone, fludrocortisone, and corticosterone
on the Hh pathway using functional assay and confirmed that they do
not bind to the CRD or adjacent TM binding cavities of SMO. The study
also suggests that dexamethasone could be additionally beneficial
as the adjuvant therapy for cancer patients with an established link
to the dysregulated Hh pathway.

Introduction
The hedgehog (Hh) pathway is an important
pathway during embryonic
development, along with concurrently active ones, such as Wnt or Notch
pathways.1 Dysregulation of the Hh pathway
in humans is observed in several developmental diseases and malformations
and is found in many cancers.1,2 Approximately, one-fourth
of all cancers either have a dysregulated Hh pathway or are Hh-dependent
for maintenance and growth.3 The Hh pathway
includes several elements.4 It is activated
by Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) protein that is autoprocessed into a shorter
and cholesterol-modified bioactive form of the protein (ShhN),5 that, in turn, binds to the Patched (PTCH) receptor
located in or near primary cilium.6 This
binding removes the inhibition of a smoothened (SMO) receptor, a key
regulator of the Hh pathway, and induces translocation of the receptor
to the plasma membrane of primary cilium.7 The SMO activation leads to the breakdown of the complex of SUFU
and three glioma (Gli)-associated transcriptional regulators.8 Gli activators move to the nucleus to regulate
transcription of various genes. Hh signals induce cell proliferation
through the upregulation of N-Myc, cyclin D/E, and FOXM1. Disruption
in pathway regulation or feedback mechanisms is associated with the
development of cancers including but not limited to basal cell carcinoma,
medulloblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma.1,9 Recent studies
have suggested an important agonistic role of cholesterol in Hh pathway
regulation. The PTCH sequence is evolutionarily conserved to bacterial
transmembrane (TM) transporters. PTCH was proposed to function as
a pump for small molecules (such as cholesterol), controlling the
activation of SMO.10 The binding of ShhN
to PTCH causes inhibition of cholesterol efflux and increases cholesterol
concentration inside the cell, which may be responsible for the induction
of SMO translocation from endosomes to the plasma membrane.7 After translocation of SMO to the primary cilium,
an extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD) binding site of SMO becomes
exposed to its natural ligand. A crystal structure of SMO bound to
cholesterol suggested the CRD binding site as the primary binding
site for cholesterol.11

Corticosteroids
and their therapeutic mimics are widely prescribed
drugs for many indications, including cancer, because of their anti-inflammatory
and immunosuppressive properties.12 One
of their targets is a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) that can modulate
the transcription of target genes by binding to specific elements
of DNA, termed GR elements, and subsequently interacting with the
RNA polymerase II.13 Because of the discovery
of cholesterol and other related steroidal compound’s ability
to modulate Hh pathway activity, it is vital to study the contribution
and mechanism of steroids play in cancer therapy. Corticosteroids
are the leading group (comprising of hydrocortisone, prednisone, prednisolone,
dexamethasone, and many more) of steroids being used in cancer therapy.14,15 They are prescribed to prevent allergic reactions, control chemotherapy-induced
nausea and vomiting, increase appetite, reduce pain and swelling in
the case of brain cancer, reduce spinal cord compression, or to help
in stem cell transplantation.15 Recently,
many steroids have been reported to be SMO agonists along with cholesterol
(also crystallized with SMO).11,16,17 Fluorinated glucocorticoids such as halcinonide and fluticasone
were shown to bind to SMO and activate the receptor.17 Because dexamethasone is widely used in cancer therapy
to decrease inflammation, swelling, or nausea caused by chemotherapy,18,19 its activities against all essential pathways including the Hh one
may affect the net therapeutic outcome.

These facts encouraged
us to search for other corticosteroids capable
of inhibiting the Hh pathway and to explore the SMO binding mode in
order to choose a better steroid for combination therapy for the management
of Hh-dependent cancers. With this aim, we tested dexamethasone and
other corticosteroids having a similar structure (fludrocortisone
and corticosterone); shown in Figure 1; for Hh pathway inhibitory activity. The versatile
and promising techniques to study receptor–ligand interactions
offer robust methods to test various drugs in cell-based enzyme-dependent
luminescence methods20,21 or fluorescent bio-markers22 or metal-based complexes23,24 for accurate quantification. We chose Gli-1-dependent luciferase
production21 and BODIPY-cyclopamine22 to test Hh pathway activity and SMO binding,
respectively. The cell-based assays confirmed the previously reported
results regarding dexamethasone and also showed for the first time
that fludrocortisone and corticosterone can also inhibit the Hh pathway.
The tested steroids failed to compete with cyclopamine for known binding
cavities in SMO, indicating an allosteric mechanism for Hh pathway
inhibition, which further can be exploited to design a combination/synergistic
therapy for Hh-dependent cancers including SMO inhibitors to reduce
the side effects. Our study is the first report to show fludrocortisone
as an Hh pathway inhibitor. Our report warrants more studies focused
on steroids and related compounds to find better alternatives for
patients with Hh-dependent cancers, immunomodulatory compounds with
additional beneficial effects and reduced adverse effects (such as
myopathy, neurotoxicity, etc.).

Results
SMO is a seven-TM (7-TM) receptor that belongs to
the frizzled
subfamily (class F) of the GPCR superfamily and plays a vital role
in the Hh pathway.25 The receptor has two
primary binding sites, one in the extracellular CRD region and another
in the TM region.4,25 Most SMO agonists and antagonists
bind to the TM binding site. The CRD binding site gained interest
recently when the crystal structure of SMO bound to cholesterol was
solved.11 Because of the similar structure
of fluorinated corticosteroids and cholesterol, we hypothesized that
they also affect the Hh pathway. Different experiments were performed
to validate this hypothesis.

Fluorinated Corticosteroids Inhibited Shh-Induced
Activation
of the Hh Pathway
The three fluorinated steroids selected,
dexamethasone, fludrocortisone, and corticosterone, were tested in
a functional Hh pathway activity assay using NIH3T3 Gli-RE cells stably
expressing firefly luciferase under the control of an 8× Gli
response element (8× Gli-RE) and treated with the active soluble
form of Shh (further referred to as ShhN). ShhN binding to PTCH induces
SMO translocation to PC and results in the activation of the Gli transcription
factors.21 This type of Gli reporter assay
is robust and was used to discover SAG, an SMO agonist.26 Cyclopamine was used as a control and was shown
to inhibit the Hh pathway in this functional assay many times.22 As expected, cyclopamine showed inhibition of
Gli-dependent increase in luciferase because of the induction of the
Hh pathway by ShhN-conditioned media in NIH3T3 Gli RE cells. Similarly,
the compounds tested here also inhibited the functional Gli-luciferase
reporter to varying degrees (Figure 2a). Among the tested compounds, dexamethasone and fludrocortisone
strongly inhibited the Gli-dependent luciferase production. Also,
there is evidence that the response to ShhN in NIH3T3 cells is an
SMO-mediated pathway.27 Therefore, Figure 2a shows that the
steroids tested in this experiment inhibit Hh pathway activity induced
by ShhN.

Figure 2 Effect of test compounds on Hh pathway activation. Hh pathway/SMO
activation induced by ShhN-conditioned media results in increased
production of Gli-dependent luciferase. NIH3T3 Gli-RE cells stably
transfected with 8× Gli-RE were used. (a) Inhibition of the Hh
pathway was tested by treating the cells with test compounds (10 μM)
in the presence or absence of ShhN-conditioned media for 24 h in low-serum
conditions. (b) Inhibition of the Hh pathway was observed after treating
the cells with test compounds (10 μM) in the presence of 20(S)-OHC
for 24 h in low-serum conditions. Data were acquired in triplicates
from three independent experiments and are presented as the mean ±
SD. Abbreviations used in this figure: ShhN—N-terminal of Shh
protein, 20(S)-OHC—20(S)-hydroxy cholesterol, CYC—cyclopamine,
DEX—dexamethasone, FDC—fludrocortisone, and CRT—corticosterone.

In addition to ShhN, the SMO receptor
and the Hh pathway are also
activated by cholesterol and various oxysterols (20(S)-hydroxy cholesterol,
OHC, being the most potential).28,29 To further confirm
the activity of fluorinated steroids under study, we used 20(S)-OHC
instead of ShhN-conditioned media as the Hh pathway activator in Gli-luciferase
assay. Cyclopamine and tested compounds inhibit the 20(S)-OHC-induced
Hh pathway activity (Figure 2b). The Gli-inhibition mechanisms for each of the fluorinated
steroids needed to be further studied.

To evaluate the concentration
dependence of the Hh inhibition,
the NIH3T3 Gli-RE cells were treated with ShhN-conditioned media (10%)
with low-serum assay media and serially diluted concentrations of
cyclopamine, dexamethasone, fludrocortisone, and corticosterone. The
observed IC50 values of cyclopamine, dexamethasone, fludrocortisone, and corticosterone were 72.1,
7.11, 20.1 and 167 nM, respectively. The concentration–response
curves for all four compounds are presented in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Concentration response profile of SMO activation
induced by ShhN-conditioned
media measured by the level of production of Gli-dependent luciferase.
NIH3T3 Gli-RE cells stably transfected with 8× Gli-RE were used.
The cells were then treated with compounds over a range of concentrations
for 24 h in low-serum conditions. The data were analyzed by nonlinear
regression and sigmoid dose–response using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad
Software, Inc.). Data were acquired in triplicates from three independent
experiments and are presented as the mean ± SD.

Fluorinated Corticosteroids Do Not Compete
with Cyclopamine
or 20(S)-OHC for Their SMO Binding Sites
Cyclopamine directly
binds to the 7-TM domain of SMO as demonstrated by crystallography
and biochemistry experiments.11,30 By doing so, it is
believed to influence the activation-associated conformational changes
in the receptor, thus inhibiting the downstream Gli signaling. Competition
binding assays and functional assays were performed to check the binding
of test compounds to SMO at the cyclopamine 7-TM binding site. The
competition binding was evaluated in HEK293t cells transiently transfected
with mSMO, using BODIPY-cyclopamine (at 5 nM conc.) as the fluorescent
probe. Cyclopamine showed a consistent concentration-dependent decrease
in fluorescence in the sample indicating the displacement of BODIPY-cyclopamine
from its binding site with an IC50 of 342 nM. However,
none of the tested fluorinated steroids (i.e., dexamethasone, fludrocortisone,
and corticosterone) displaced BODIPY-cyclopamine (supplemented at
5 nM) from SMO in a dose-dependent manner except for a minimal change
in fluorescence at the highest concentration of test compounds (50
μM). The results of the competition binding assay are shown
in Figure 4a. The results
indicated that the corticosteroids are likely to bind to a different
location than the cyclopamine-binding site of SMO.

Figure 4 Fluorinated steroids
do not bind to SMO cyclopamine binding sites.
(a) BODIPY-cyclopamine competition binding assay was performed with
mSMO transiently transfected HEK293t cells. The geometric mean of
fluorescence intensity of samples was estimated using flow cytometry
in the presence of different concentrations of cyclopamine (positive
control, binds to the 7-TM binding site of SMO) and test compounds.
(b) Gli-luciferase functional assay was performed in NIH3T3 Gli-RE
cells activated by a SMO agonist 20(S)-OHC (binds the CRD binding
site of SMO). The concentration–response curve of 20(S)-OHC
was prepared in the presence of 0.5 μM concentration of steroids
under study. The EC50 of 20(S)-OHC did not change instead
max response decreased, indicating a noncompetitive relationship between
the two tested compounds. Data were acquired in triplicates from three
independent experiments and are presented as the mean ± standard
deviation (SD).

To further explore the
mechanism of inhibition of SMO by corticosteroids,
we tested them in a competitive functional assay against 20(S)-OHC,
a known small molecule agonist of SMO that binds to the CRD pocket.25 In NIH3T3 Gli-RE cells, 20(S)-OHC causes a robust
dose-dependent increase in luminescence with an EC50 of
3.5 μM. When the cells were exposed to 20(S)-OHC in the presence
of dexamethasone, fludrocortisone, and corticosterone at 0.5 μM
concentration, the maximum signaling response induced by 20(S)-OHC
was affected but its EC50 was not shifted indicating noncompetitive
inhibition (Figure 4b). The result indicates that the test drugs do not bind to SMO at
the 20(S)-OHC CRD binding site.

Cyclopamine and Fluorinated
Corticosteroids Combine To Inhibit
Hh Pathway Activity
From the data presented, it is clear
that the tested corticosteroids (dexamethasone, fludrocortisone, and
corticosterone) do not compete for the CRD or TMD binding sites of
SMO. We hypothesized that the two compounds might synergize to inhibit
Hh pathway activity. We tested the combination using fixed doses of
cyclopamine and fluorinated corticosteroids at 100 nM concentration
in NIH3T3 Gli-RE cells using functional Gli-luciferase assay. The
combination improves Hh pathway inhibition as compared to individual
compounds, but this effect appears additive rather than synergistic.
The additive effect suggests that the two categories of compounds
tested here work through different sites to inhibit Gli production
in the cells, which leads to the inhibition of the Hh pathway in cells.
The additive inhibitory effect opens a possibility of using these
steroids in combination with other Hh pathway inhibitors (e.g., vismodegib)
to increase the anti-Hh treatment efficacy. The results are presented
in Figure 5. The level
of inhibition was maximal with dexamethasone and minimal with corticosterone,
which is in-line with the observed IC50 of these compounds.

Figure 5 Fluorinated
steroids (100 nM) and cyclopamine (100 nM) additively
inhibit Hh pathway activity. The Hh pathway activity inhibition was
tested by adding steroids (100 nM) with and without cyclopamine (100
nM) in a functional assay using NIH3T3 Gli-RE cells in the presence
of ShhN-conditioned media. The two inhibitors have an additive inhibition
effect on the Hh pathway, indicating that they act on different pathways
resulting in reduced Gli production in cells. Ctr = control, DEX =
dexamethasone, FDC = fludrocortisone, and CRT = corticosterone. Data
were acquired in triplicates from three independent experiments and
are presented as the mean ± SD.

Discussion
Corticosteroids have been used for brain
cancer patients to reduce
tumor-associated edema and neurological deficits.18,31 When these widely used drugs15 are used
in cancer,18 the beneficial effects must
be carefully evaluated and balanced against numerous side effects,
including osteoporosis and cataract formation. Hh signaling pathway,
mediated by SMO and Gli proteins, is dysregulated in various cancers
including brain cancers.1,2,32,33 Recent reports on the inhibition
of the Hh pathway by steroids and steroid derivatives17,34 prompt questions about the scope, scale, and direction of the Hh
modulation for each of the drugs in this class. Although several steroids
such as cholesterol,29 halcinonide, fluticasone,17 and cholesterol derivative 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol35 are shown to be SMO agonists, others are antagonists.
The new SMO crystal structure solved with cholesterol11 suggested that the steroids could compete with cholesterol
at the CRD binding site to impair the Hh signaling. Most of the SMO
antagonists (e.g., budesonide and ciclesonide) with a steroidal structure
are reported to be inhibitors of SMO-mediated ciliary translocation.34 Dexamethasone was reported to be the Hh pathway
inhibitor, but the mechanism of its inhibitory activity was not fully
described.17 Therefore, we wanted to test
if dexamethasone and structurally similar steroids (fludrocortisone
and corticosterone) can also inhibit the SMO activity and whether
they compete with cyclopamine for the same binding site.

The
experimental data reported here clearly shows that the tested
synthetic halogenated derivatives of cortisol, dexamethasone, and
fludrocortisone are potential inhibitors of the Hh pathway activity
(Figures 2 and 3). The Gli-dependent luciferase reporter assay performed
in NIH3T3 Gli-RE cells is a specific assay to see the effect of various
molecules on Hh pathway activity. However, these steroids were not
binding to SMO CRD and were not competing with cholesterol. Furthermore,
none of the tested steroids competed with 20(S)-OHC (SMO agonists
binding to CRD cavity) in a functional assay (Figure 4b). The BODIPY-cyclopamine competitive binding
assay (Figure 4a) illustrated
that the cyclopamine SMO-TM binding site is not affected either. These
results lead to a hypothesis that these compounds may be affecting
Hh pathway activity through an alternative SMO binding site or an
indirect mechanism. The experiment showing an additive effect on inhibition
of the Hh pathway by cyclopamine (Figure 5) further supports this hypothesis.

A recent report29 shows that SMO activation
can be mediated by opening a tunnel through the TM part of the receptor
(from TM7 to the extracellular opening near CRD). The authors proposed
that cholesterol may travel through the tunnel from intracellular
to extracellular space of the cells, and then binds to the CRD binding
cavity to induce conformational change needed for SMO activation.29 This report opened up the possibility of explaining
the observed effect of fluorinated corticosteroids characterized in
our study. Dexamethasone and fludrocortisone may compete with cholesterol
(because of their structural similarity) and may inhibit the travel
of cholesterol through the tunnel such as structure opened in the
SMO TM region and allosterically inhibit SMO activation. The tunnel
binding may explain the lack of competition with cyclopamine (7TM)
or 20(S)-OHC (CRD).

Another plausible mechanism for Hh pathway
inhibition by steroids
could involve effects on other related pathways. There is evidence
that the Hh pathway is influenced by other pathways in the cells and
responds to the changing cellular microenvironment. The glucocorticoids
(including dexamethasone) have been reported to decrease β-arrestin-2
gene expression in human lung carcinoma cells in a concentration-dependent
manner.36 The Hh pathway inhibitory glucocorticoids
may affect the pathway through several mechanisms including but not
limited to arrestin-dependent SMO localization in primary cillia37 or SMO phosphorylation by G protein-coupled
receptor kinase 2 (GRK2).38 It was experimentally
confirmed that before SMO activation, β-arrestin-2 interacts
with Kif3a (a subunit of the kinesin-2 motor complex) in cilia. The
interaction between β-arrestin and Kif3a is required for localization
of SMO in primary cilia and efficient Gli-dependent transcription.37,39 The β-arrestin-2 is also associated with GRK2-mediated phosphorylation
of the SMO receptor cytoplasmic domains as demonstrated in HEK-293
cells and zebrafish embryos.38,40 These findings highlight
a central role for the GRK-β-arrestin system in SMO signaling
in vertebrates. Therefore, it is possible that dexamethasone, fludrocortisone,
and corticosterone may exert their Hh pathway inhibitory effects by
binding to GR, which leads to the inhibition of β-arrestin-2
gene expression. Glucocorticoids may also affect the Hh pathway by
changing the composition of intracellular lipid rafts41 or binding to other possible cholesterol binding sites.42,43

In conclusion, our report presents evidence that Hh/SMO signaling
can be efficiently inhibited by at least two steroids which are often
prescribed to cancer patients to reduce chemotherapy-related and radiotherapy-related
side effects and brain edema. The binding mechanism is likely to be
complementary to the SMO inhibitor cyclopamine. This study reveals
that dexamethasone and fludrocortisone could be better choices for
adjuvant therapy in cancer patients with dysregulated Hh pathway.

Materials
and Methods
Chemicals and Reagents
Cyclopamine was purchased from
Cayman Chemical Company. BODIPY-cyclopamine was purchased from Biovision.
Dexamethasone, fludrocortisone, and corticosterone were purchased
from Sigma. 20(S)-hydroxy cholesterol was purchased from Tocris Bioscience.

For the assays, test compounds were prepared at 10-fold the final
well concentrations in assay media, across six concentrations, using
1:10 or 1:5 serial dilutions from the highest concentration (stock
solution conc. usually 10 mM). All stock solutions were stored at
−20 °C.

Cells and Plasmids
HEK293t cells
were obtained from
ATCC. NIH3T3 Gli-RE cells (NIH3T3, mouse embryonic fibroblast cells,
stably transfected with firefly luciferase under the transcriptional
control of 8× Gli response element) were obtained from BPS Bioscience,
San Diego, CA. HEK293t cells were cultured in the Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% of fetal
bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in an atmosphere with 5% CO2. NIH3T3 Gli-RE cells were cultured in the DMEM supplemented with
10% of BCS and Geneticin.

The mSMO and ShhN (Shh N-terminal
domain) plasmids were purchased from Addgene. All vectors were propagated
in XL10 Gold competent cells, purified with NucleoBond Xtra Midi kit
(Clontech), and sequenced (Genewiz).

For the production of ShhN-conditioned
media and for the BODIPY-cyclopamine
competition binding assay, HEK293t cells were seeded at a density
of 1.5 × 106 in a 6 cm dish, allowed to grow overnight,
and then transfected with either ShhN or mSMO plasmid DNA (6 μg
DNA per 6 cm dish) using a TransIT transfection reagent (Mirus Bio
LLC) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell culture
media was replaced with DMEM + 10% FBS before mSMO transfection and
with DMEM + 10% BCS before ShhN transfection. The transfected dish
was incubated for approximately 24 h at 37 °C. The ShhN-conditioned
medium was produced in ShhN-transfected HEK293t cells. The culture
medium from ShhN-transfected HEK293t cells was collected and aliquoted
in single-use 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. This ShhN-enriched media was
either used fresh or stored at −20 °C for later use. For
BODIPY-cyclopamine competition binding assay, HEK293t cells transfected
with mSMO plasmid were lifted with trypsin (0.25%), re-plated in 96-well
adherent plates, and incubated for an additional 24 h before the experiment.

Gli-Luciferase Functional Assay
NIH3T3 Gli-RE cells
were plated at 1.2 × 104 cells per well in 100 μL
of DMEM + 10% BCS media in 96-well tissue culture-treated plate (Falcon,
353219). After 24 h, when the cells reached confluency, the culture
medium was replaced with 80 μL/well of the assay medium [Optimem
± 10 mM (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid ±
1 mM sodium pyruvate + 1× MEM NEAA]. Serial dilutions of test
compounds (10× of final concentrations) were prepared in assay
media. 10 μL of diluted compounds (10× the final concentration)
or control media were added to the plate after which the plate was
incubated for 15–30 min at 37 °C. Then, the cells were
stimulated by the addition of either ShhN-conditioned media or control
media (DMEM ± 10% BCS) at a final concentration of 10% (1% BCS
per well). Following incubation of the plate for at least 28 h at
37 °C, the cells were simultaneously lysed and supplemented with
a luciferase substrate by the addition of an equal volume of Steady-Glo
reagent (Promega, E2520) directly to the assay media. Plates were
mixed by pipetting, centrifuged to eliminate foam, incubated for 10
min, and analyzed using a Perkin Elmer Victor X luminescence plate
reader. The results were analyzed using nonlinear regression (Prism
6, GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Data were normalized to the maximal
response observed for ShhN-stimulated cells in the same experiment.
A sigmoidal-dose response curve was used as a model for data analysis
and IC50 value calculation.

BODIPY-Cyclopamine Competition
Binding Assay
HEK293t
cells transiently transfected with mSMO were lifted with trypsin (0.25%)
and replated at 6 × 104 cells in 80 μL DMEM
+ 10% FBS per well in a 96 well tissue culture-treated plate (Falcon,
353219). The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Serial dilutions
of test compounds (10× final concentrations) were prepared in
culture media. 10 μL of diluted compounds or control media were
added to the plate after which the plate was incubated at 37 °C
for 10 min. Next, BODIPY-cyclopamine was added to each well at a final
concentration of 5 nM, except for control wells that were left unstained.
Following at least 1.5 h incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, cells were lifted by vigorous pipetting, transferred to conical
bottom 96-well plates, and centrifuged at 400g for
5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, cells were resuspended
in 300 μL of PBS + 0.5% BSA (freshly prepared), and the plate
was analyzed with a Guava benchtop flow cytometer. The results were
interpreted with FlowJo software (version v10.1). Dose–response
curves were constructed in Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).
