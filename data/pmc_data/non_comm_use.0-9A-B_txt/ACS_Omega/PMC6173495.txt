We report a quantitative
evaluation of the choice of reporters
for multiplexed surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). An initial
library consisted of 15 reporter molecules that included commonly
used Raman dyes, thiolated reporters, and other small molecules. We
used a correlation matrix to downselect Raman reporters from the library
to choose five candidates: 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene, 4-mercaptobenzoic
acid, 3,5-dichlorobenzenthiol, pentachlorothiophenol, and 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic
acid). We evaluated the ability to distinguish the five SERS reporters
in a dipstick immunoassay for the biomarker human IgG. Raman nanotags,
or gold nanostars conjugated to the five reporters and anti-human
IgG polyclonal antibodies were constructed. A linear discriminant
analysis approach was used to evaluate the separation of the nanotag
spectra in mixtures of fixed ratios.

Introduction
Surface-enhanced Raman
spectroscopy (SERS) has become attractive
for sensing and detection applications because of its high sensitivity
and multiplexing capabilities. Raman spectra can serve as a unique
signal, or fingerprint, that can be leveraged for specific and sensitive
detection of analytes. Even though Raman scattering is weak, the Raman
signal of a molecule can be greatly enhanced by being in proximity
to a roughened metal surface or a nanoparticle by several orders of
magnitude, as high as 109.1−3 Consequently, SERS has
become a powerful technique because of its high sensitivity to detect
analytes,4 sometimes down to attomol levels.

In particular, using SERS enhancement in the nanotag conformation
has been useful for expanding the capabilities of biological sensing,
imaging, and detection. Typically, a reporter molecule is conjugated
to the surface of a nanoparticle,5−7 which provides the SERS
signal. The nanoparticle is attached to a species that can bind to
a biomolecule with specificity, such as an antibody, peptide, targeting
ligand, or aptamer, thus enabling measurement of the presence of a
biomolecule via the Raman signal of the reporter on the NP surface.
This approach has been applied successfully for cell imaging,8−10 paper-based immunoassays,11−13 bead assays,14 and other biological applications.15,16 In addition, the ability to excite the Raman reporters in the tissue
window facilitates in vivo detection and imaging.17

SERS becomes more powerful when it is highly multiplexed,
and thus
approaches to expand the number of nanotags in an experiment have
been pursued for techniques such as screening peptide libraries,14 sorting cell-binding species, multiplexed imaging,
and many others.18,19 Fortunately, there is a multitude
of Raman reporters that can be found in the literature, such as Raman
dyes [e.g., malachite green (MG), methylene blue (MB), and crystal
violet (CV)]20 which are widely used in
cell imaging because of their intense signals. Thiolated molecules21 (e.g., 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (MBA), 4-methoxythiophenol)
are commonly used because of their ability to conjugate directly to
gold surfaces.22 In addition to these classes
of molecules, there are a many other small molecules with characteristic
Raman spectral features [e.g., 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene (BPE)] that
has made them well suited for SERS.23 Others
have demonstrated multicolor SERS detection with combinations of a
large number of reporters in bar coding approaches and have been able
to successfully deconvolute the spectra of multiple reporters.24,25 Furthermore, strategies such as multiplexing with orthogonal measurement
techniques such as fluorescence spectroscopy can introduce an even
higher degree of diversity.16

However,
the performance of a SERS multiplexed assay relies on
the ability to deconvolute the signals from each of the reporters.
Spectral overlap between reporter makes deconvolution more difficult,
and thus reporters are chosen to have minimal overlap. Selecting these
molecules is typically straightforward for situations which require
only one or two nanotags, as it is easy to find two reporters with
minimally overlapping spectra, especially if they are small molecules.26 Unfortunately, achieving minimal spectral overlap
becomes increasingly difficult when a large number of reporters are
required. While this is straightforward for two reporters, this rapidly
becomes more challenging as the number of required reporters increases.
This is further complicated by the use of larger molecules such as
Raman dyes which have complicated spectra. The choice of Raman reporters
can be a major limiting factor in multiplex design, and suboptimal
reporter choice can compromise deconvolution and ultimately multiplexing
capability.

While multiplexed SERS has been achieved previously,
a quantitative
method for selecting a set of reporter molecules has not yet been
detailed, and there is no generally accepted approach. Typically reporters
are selected based on the separation of their most prominent peaks,
and are often eyeballed, which is not feasible for highly multiplexed
assays. Thus, there is a need for a method for choosing and also evaluating
an optimal set of reporters for their proper deconvolution. Furthermore,
ratiometric information between analytes is often necessary for clinical
assays, so the ability to quantify the contributions of the different
reporter molecules is desirable.27

Here, we investigate a protocol for selecting a set of optimal
reporters for a multiplexed SERS assay and their relative quantification
that could serve as a method to provide differential diagnosis among
diseases presenting distinct levels of the same biomarkers. This method
is based on the use of a correlation matrix as a first pass screen
to select a group of reporters with minimal overlap, and then the
use of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to train the system to be
able to associate different ratios to a certain disease, with an efficiency
of up to 88% for a 5-plexed mixture. We applied this procedure to
a SERS-based multiplexed dipstick sandwich immunoassays using human
IgG as a model analyte because its promising use as a biomarker in
point-of-care devices for detection of infectious diseases.

Results
and Discussion
Optimization of Reporter Selection
We first generated
a list of compounds for Raman reporters drawn from the literature,
which consisted of commonly used reporters, from Raman dyes (brilliant
blue, cresyl violet, etc.), to thiolated molecules (e.g., 4-MBA) and
other small molecules known to have a characteristic Raman spectrum
(e.g., BPE).

To distinguish the different Raman reporters in
a multiplexed signal, it is desirable to use molecules whose Raman
signature overlaps the least with each other so as to preserve their
most salient spectral features in the multiplexed signal. In this
context, developing metrics to assess the degree of overlap between
Raman reporters might aid the choice of a least-overlapping set of
species within the library. Here, we propose to use the correlation
between the spectra of each reporter as a measure of overlap. Given
two discrete Raman spectra Si and Sj, their
correlation is given by 1  where wmin and wmax are the minimum and maximum wavelength of
the spectra, respectively. As the intensity of these spectra is non-negative
for any wavelength, we have that each term of the sum above will be
non-negative, and thus the correlation value Ci,j will be bounded below
by 0. If the spectra are normalized by their squared norm, that is, , and
then the correlation value is also
bounded above by 1. The presence of these two bounds yields an overlap
metric that is easily interpretable. When the spectra Si and Sj have no overlap at all, their correlation is 0.
As the degree of overlap increases, their correlation Ci,j also increases until
reaching Ci,j = 1, which is only the case when the spectra Si = Sj.

First, we evaluated the overlap of 15 Raman reporters
using a correlation
matrix calculated from their SERS spectra. Star-shaped gold nanoparticles,
gold nanostars (GNSs), were synthesized as previously described because
of their strong Raman enhancement properties,28 using a HAuCl4 reduction in N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (HEPES).29−31 Their hydrodynamic diameter (DH) measured
by dynamic light scattering was 38.49 ± 10.45 nm and the zeta
potential −39.17 ± 1.13 mV. They exhibited a surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) at 754 nm, confirming absorption in the near-infrared
(Figure 1a). Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) imaging confirmed star-shaped particles
with a core size of ∼20 nm and arm lengths of ∼30 nm
(Figure 1b), consistent
with previous results.28,32

GNS were conjugated to the different reporter molecules
in solution
(GNS–Rep). The incubation ratio was chosen such that the reporter
was high enough to be in excess of 1 monolayer on the GNS, based on
calculated values of GNS surface areas.31 The final amount of reporter was adjusted afterward so that they
showed similar intensities in their SERS signal. After conjugation
to reporters, GNS–Rep were coated with thiolated PEG to enhance
their colloidal stability (Supporting Information Figure S1), and their SERS spectra were measured (Figure 2a). The correlation for the
15 reporters was then calculated and a correlation matrix was constructed
by taking the normalized SERS spectrum of each reporter and computing
the correlations as explained above using wmin = 400 cm–1 and wmax = 1800 cm–1 (Figure 2b). Color in the matrix indicates the value
of the correlation, with yellow showing high degree of overlap between
pairs of spectra and blue showing a low degree.

Name legend: brilliant cresyl blue (BCB), crystal violet (CV), methylene
blue (MB), malachite green isocyanate (MG), methylene green (MEG),
neutral red (NR), rose bengal (RB), rhodamine 6G (R6G), victoria blue
(VB), 4-aminothiophenol (ATP), BPE, MBA, 3,5-dichlorobenzenthiol (DCT),
pentachlorothiophenol (PCTP), and 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic
acid) (DTNB).

The reporters exhibited
different amounts of overlap with one another.
In general, Raman dyes are larger and consequently have more complex
spectra, with a higher number of peaks and therefore higher degree
of overlap, as evidenced by the yellow off-diagonal regions in the
upper left area of the matrix. For example, CV, MG, and MEG all present
high overlap with each otherwith correlation values close to 1 (yellow)
in their intersections in the matrix. In contrast, smaller molecules
possess simpler spectra with sparser peaks, which leads to less overlap
across reporters, as shown by the reduced off-diagonal signal in the
lower right corner of the correlation matrix. For instance, BPE had
low overlap with most of the small molecules, such as DCT and DTNB.
On the basis of these criteria, we selected five reporters with the
lowest overlap amongst each other for the multiplexed experiments:
BPE, MBA, DCT, PCTP, and DTNB.

Nanotag Synthesis and Characterization
The selected
reporter molecules were then tested in a multiplexed sandwich immunoassay,
as they are used widely in lateral flow or dipstick tests for point
of care diagnostics. Furthermore, SERS has been promising in enhancing
the sensitivity of lateral flow immunoassays (LFAs).14,28 When using SERS for a multiplexed sandwich immunoassay, the five
nanoparticle–reporter conjugates would be conjugated to five
different antibodies specific for their respective biomarkers, resulting
in five nanotags. However, to investigate the presented approach for
optimal reporter selection, we used the same antibody–antigen
for all five nanotags, which would allow us to compare SERS signals
without the complication of varying antibody–antigen affinities
across the nanotags. The model antigen–antibody used in this
approach was human IgG (antigen) and anti-human IgG (antibody), as
its detection is often used as a biomarker for infectious diseases
based on a patient immune response to an infection.

GNS were
first coated with each Raman reporter, followed by the conjugation
to polyclonal anti-human IgG antibodies via adsorption for use in
the paper dipstick immunoassays. Ab conjugation was achieved by incubation
of the GNS–Rep with the Abs at a molar ratio of 400:1 Ab–GNS.
Afterward, thiolated PEG (5 kDa) was added as a backfill for the remaining
bare gold surface to reduce nonspecific interactions (Figure 3a).

conjugates (“nanotags”).
Normalized optical spectra of plain nanostars (GNS; yellow), after

addition (GNS–Rep–Ab–PEG; green) for (b) BPE,
(c) MBA, (d) DCT, (e) PCTP, and (f) DTNB.

Reporter and Ab-conjugation was confirmed by a red shift
of the
SPR peak of ∼30 nm for all conjugated samples after reporter
addition and ∼25 nm after antibody conjugation and PEG addition,
which can be attributed to changes in the refractive index surrounding
the GNS with the reporter, protein, and PEG layers.33 A slight broadening of the SPR peak can be due to some
extent to GNS aggregation (Figure 3b–f). GNS aggregation is undesirable and depending
on the application should be eliminated or minimized; however, for
the dipstick assays, the extent of aggregation did not impact immunoassay
function. The aggregation index of the conjugates was calculated to
quantify their colloidal stability, showing a slight increase for
GNS–Rep–Ab–PEG as compared to plain GNS (Supporting Information Figure S2).34

Additionally, antibody conjugation to
the GNS was confirmed by
an increase in DH values between 90 and
180 nm relative to bare GNS (Figure 4a), as well as a decrease in zeta potential of ∼25
mV for all five samples, showing a change in the GNS surface due to
the antibody attachment (Figure 4b). The increase in DH could
be attributed to the adsorption of the Raman reporters, a multilayer
of Abs on the GNS, and the PEG backfill.

GNS. (a) DH and (b) zeta potential of
anti-IgG-conjugated GNS (error
bars are measurements of n = 5 ± standard deviation).

The antibody surface density on
the GNS, or coverage, was quantified
using the bicinchoninic acid quantification assay (BCA assay) (Supporting Information Figure S3) in combination
with the GNS concentration obtained by UV–vis spectroscopy.
Coverages were determined to be ≈58, 58, 66, 37, and 53 Ab–GNS33,35 for BPE, MBA, DCT, PCTP, and DTNB nanotags, respectively. Assuming
a footprint of 81.3 nm236 for
a typical IgG antibody and that synthesized GNSs have an average surface
area of 3.6 × 103 nm2,31,36 the results suggest a multilayer coverage for most of the nanotags.

Dipstick Immunoassays
Immunoassays were run in a dipstick
conformation consisting of a nitrocellulose strip onto which anti-human
IgG was immobilized on the test line and a control antibody (anti-Fc)
on the control line (Figure 5a). To run the assay, the nitrocellulose strips were partially
immersed in a buffered solution of Tween-20 1%, sucrose 50%, and bovine
serum albumin (BSA) 10% (w/v), which contained nanotags at 0.6 nM
and human IgG at a concentration of 40 μg/mL, which is below
typical biomarker patient levels in sera for diseases such as malaria.37 Additionally, these levels of IgG ensured excess
of antigen, so that all nanotags could bind to IgG and form the sandwich
on the test line in equal conditions when they were all mixed together
in the multiplex assay. Upon contact with the nitrocellulose, the
fluid migrated up the strip by capillary action to an absorbent pad
attached at the top of the strip to serve as a fluid sink. If human
IgG was present, the assay resulted in a visible spot appearing at
the test line, indicating the accumulation of GNS because of binding
of IgG to both the Ab on the nanotag and the immobilized Ab on the
strip (sandwich formation). A spot should appear on the control line,
even for negative tests (no IgG present), indicating the binding of
the anti-Fc antibodies to the Ab on the nanotag. This showed that
sample flow through the strip was complete.

sandwich immunoassay for IgG. (a) Dipstick
flow immunoassay scheme. (b) Resulting strips from running individual
nanotags with the five reporters (strips 2–6) and strip from
the mixture of all nanotags (strip 7). Strip 1 is the negative control.
(c) SERS spectra of the negative control, the five nanotags and the
mixture (mix).

Positive tests resulted
for all five nanotags run individually
(strips 2–6, Figure 5b). When IgG was not present, the assay did not produce a
visible spot at the test line but still resulted in a spot at the
control line (strip 1), which was indicative of a negative test (Supporting Information, Figure S4a). This confirmed
that the sandwich formed only when IgG was present but that the control
line antibodies could still bind to the nanotag. In a colorimetric
analysis, the test areas had the same appearance for all of the nanotags,
as they were synthesized with the same GNS. Even when running a multiplex
assay mixing the five nanotags, the color of the spot on the test
line was the same with higher intensity (strip 7, Figure 5b). Increasing the nanotag
concentration (Supporting Information,
Figure S5) and antigen concentration (Supporting Information Figure S6) resulted in a higher SERS intensity.

To be able to distinguish between nanotags on the test line and
therefore between biomarkers, the SERS signal on the test line was
measured with a confocal Raman microscope. The SERS spectrum (400–1800
cm–1) was acquired from the entire test area using
a Raman confocal microscope and averaged over multiple (30) locations
in the test area. Test areas exhibited spectra characteristic of each
reporter used in the different nanotags, confirming their presence
at the test line (Figure 5c). Even though the nanoparticle concentration was the same
for each of the individual nanotags, the SERS signal of each sample
can still differ because of other factors32 such as inherent reporter Raman intensity and reporter concentration
on the GNS, as well as the antibody surface density (coverage) on
the nanoparticle.38 SERS measurements of
the test area for a strip run with a mixture of all of the nanotags
(mix, purple line) resulted in a spectrum exhibiting the different
features of each individual reporter, which could be distinguished
in the spectrum. SERS measurements of the test areas for tests run
with no IgG present showed spectra characteristic of nitrocellulose,
with no spectral contributions of the Raman reporters, confirming
the negative control (Supporting Information, Figure S4b).

Multiplexed Immunoassay
To test
the separability of
the different nanotags in a dipstick immunoassay, we used the five
nanotags in a multiplexed assay with the goal of evaluating the ability
to deconvolute the spectra into nanotag contributions. First, we investigated
the nanotags individually, when only a single reporter was present.
Each nanotag was run in a dipstick immunoassay and 30 Raman spectra
were recorded for each of the experiments. Their relative contributions
were estimated from the SERS spectra by measuring the presence of
each nanotag in the test using a non-negative least squares (LS) algorithm
on a basis of a separate set of individually run strips (Supporting Information Figure S7).32 A representative result of the LS estimation
is shown in Figure 6, where the detected presence of each of the reporters is shown for
each of the 30 spectra recorded for the MBA sample. The LS algorithm
was able to reliably estimate the presence of MBA, while keeping the
contribution of the rest of reporters close to 0. The results for
the other 4 nanotags are shown in Supporting Information Figure S8.

Figure 6 Nanotag ratio estimation for an assay run with an individual
nanotag
using the LS algorithm where MBA was present at 100% and all other
reporters were at 0% (mixture 2). Each data point represents the individual
SERS intensities for a region of the test area. Red boxes show 50%
of the data between the second (lower limit) and the third quartile
(upper limit), and the median (white line). Whiskers indicate the
value of the maximum and the minimum. SERS intensities were measured
for 30 regions in a test area. Light blue boxes represent the real
ratio of reporter in the mixture.

In many cases, the multiplexed assay is designed to detect
a particular
condition between a set of candidates. If so, it might be of interest
for the detection platform to be able to translate the estimated presence
ratio of each nanotag into one of the candidate conditions to be detected.
For that end, we train an LDA classifier whose input is the nanotag
ratio estimated by the LS algorithm and whose output is an integer
label, from 1 to 5, that indicates which one of the reporters was
present in the experiment.

The LDA classifier was trained with
a Monte-Carlo cross-validation
scheme as follows. In each iteration, five Raman spectra per experiment
were selected at random and saved as a test set and the rest was used
as the classifier training set. The LDA classifier was trained using
the training set of all experiments and then tested with the test
sets, leading to five classification results per experiment. This
procedure was repeated 200 times to ensure that the random partition
of the spectra sets would cover a wide enough range of partitions,
leading to 1000 classification results per experiment. The aggregated
results of the classification are shown in the confusion matrix in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Confusion matrix of the
individual tests using the LDA classifier.

For each cell in the matrix, the row index indicates the
true presence
of that sample, while the column index indicates the estimated label,
that is, the value in row 2 and column 5 indicates how many samples
from the second nanotag mixture were classified as coming from mixture
5. It follows that correct estimations will accumulate in the diagonal
of the confusion matrix, whereas misclassifications will be located
in the off-diagonals. Each row in the matrix adds up to a 1000, as
the classifier was tested with five samples per experiment. The LDA
classifier was able to correctly classify all the samples, with 0
misclassifications out of the 5000 tests (Figure 6).

We then tested the ability to distinguish
between nanotags when
present in a mixture, and the ability to quantify their relative ratios.
Ratios of biomarkers can be used to provide a diagnosis, where IgG/IgM
ratios can be used to detect dengue27 or
percentages of IgG, IgA, and IgM can provide information regarding
the type of malaria.37 Therefore, being
able to identify biomarker’s levels within a common set of
biomarkers could help in the differentiation among different conditions
(Figure 8).

Figure 8 Diagram of
the approach followed to identify the mixture present
in a sample based on the nanotag ratio.

To quantitatively estimate the nanotag contribution in a
mixture
and be able to distinguish between different mixtures showing the
same set of biomarkers, we made 12 different unique mixtures of the
five nanotags at varying contributions, as a sampling of the infinite
possible mixtures that could exist. These mixtures were then analyzed
using the LS estimation and the LDA classifier. For each mixture,
the five nanotags (BPE, MBA, DCT, PCTP, and DTNB–nanotag) were
mixed at predefined ratios of the different nanotags (Table 1). A dipstick immunoassay was
run for each of these samples, and the spectra were taken for each
of the mixtures (Supporting Information, Figure S9). To minimize competition between nanotags, the strip
was run with excess IgG, and the mixture of nanotags was prepared
separately and then added to the IgG.

The nanotag
contributions for each of the spectra were estimated
using the NNLS algorithm (Supporting Information, Figure S10). Figure 9 shows a representative case of the LS ratio estimation for one of
the mixtures, mixture 5, which had BPE 20%, MBA 39%, DCT 20%, PCTP
12%, and DTNB 10%, where the light blue boxes indicate the true ratio.
Compared with our previous experiment with single reporters, it is
clear that the estimation exhibits more variance and a systematic
bias in the mean. These biases might be caused by the simultaneous
presence of different nanotags at comparable concentrations in the
strip.

had BPE 20%, MBA 39%, DCT 20%, PCTP 12%, and DTNB 10%. Each data point
represents the individual SERS intensities for a region of the test
area. Red boxes show 50% of the data between the second (lower limit)
and the third quartile (upper limit), and the median (white line).
Whiskers indicate the value of the maximum and the minimum. SERS intensities
were measured for 30 regions in a test area. Light blue boxes represent
the real ratio of reporter in the mixture.

Certain reporters were consistently under- or over-estimated
in
the experiments. In general, the concentration of BPE–nanotags
was underestimated in all of the mixtures where it was present, whereas
the PCTP–nanotag contribution was always overestimated in the
mixtures where it was present. MBA–nanotag concentrations were
misestimated in some samples (mixtures 6, 8, and 9), but it generally
was comparable to the real ratio. In the case of DCT–nanotags,
its predicted contribution was fairly accurate, though slightly below
the real value in some samples (mixtures 7, 11, and 12). Last, DTNB–nanotags
were both underestimated (mixtures 7, 9, and 11) and overestimated
in some cases (mixtures 8 and 10). Contributions of the nanotags that
were not present in the mixtures were all low, at values <3%.

Despite the presence of these estimation biases, we can still perform
an accurate classification of the different pre-defined mixtures if
the trained classifier is aware of them. As in the previous experiment,
an LDA classifier is trained with the ratios estimated by the LS algorithm
using the same training procedure. The cross-validation scheme led
to 1000 classification tasks per mixture, and these results are shown
in the confusion matrix (Figure 10).

Figure 10 Confusion matrix of the 12 mixtures tested as defined
by Table 1 using LDA
classifier.

The presented classifier
achieved an average true positive rate
(TPR) of 88%, with 8 of the 12 mixtures exhibiting an accuracy >90%.
Interestingly, more than half of the misclassification instances occurred
between mixtures 7, 9, and 11, showing TPR between 60 and 79%. While
the ratios in these mixtures are only moderately similar to one another
(Table 1), the estimated
ratios for each of them exhibit a significant resemblance, because
of the consistent bias of the reporters’ presence estimation
(Supporting Information, Figure S10). The
fact that these misclassifications arise from the combination of particular
mixture ratios and particular estimation biases shows that not only
the choice of Raman reporters is important when designing a sensing
system, but also that the way in which each reporter is assigned to
each biomarker can make an impact on the platform’s capabilities.

Regarding these biases, the discrepancy between the real and predicted
ratios by the classifier could be due to several factors. As previously
discussed, all nanotags used had the same antibody conjugate and the
test areas had the same antibody immobilized on the paper strip, so
relative antibody–antigen affinities cannot account for the
discrepancy. However, different Ab coverage between nanotags can distort
the estimated presence of each reporter and while these differences
are irrelevant when running the nanotags individually, they are a
key factor when mixed together, suggesting a collective effect. In
addition, we know that signal throughout the test line is not uniform,
where the bottom of the test area has a much higher signal than the
rest of the spot.32 Aggregation of nanotags
at the test area can further increase the signal because of creation
of hot spots. If nanotags do not migrate uniformly through the spot,
and reporter coverages on the GNS differ, then their signal could
be enhanced differently.

We also analyzed the separability of
GNS–Rep–PEG
with no antibodies mixed in the same ratios as shown in Table 1 and spotted onto the nitrocellulose
support without running the dipstick assay. Spectra of the GNS–Rep–PEG
were similar to the Ab-conjugated nanotags (Supporting Information, Figure S11), although the SERS signal from the
immunoassay test line showed higher peak resolution and thus provided
more information regarding the content of the mixture. LS estimation
for spotted samples (Supporting Information Figure S12) showed higher deviation of the values caused by the
lower homogeneity of the spotted samples as compared to the test line
(dipstick test), and hence the LDA classifier showed a poor performance
in distinguishing among different mixtures (Supporting Information Figure S13).

Conclusions
The
application of SERS for multiplexed bioassays is rapidly growing,
with examples in cell imaging, biomarker detection, and so forth.
We report an approach for choosing multiple reporters in an optimal
manner and a means to quantitatively evaluate their levels with an
accuracy of 88%, which could be particularly interesting for the detection
of nonspecific biomarkers present in diverse clinical conditions.
Certain reporter molecules such as PCTP tend to be overestimated in
their spectral contribution, so the approach could aid in the choice
of reporters. The nanotag set here described could be further expanded
by the presented approach to increase the degree of multiplexing.
This work could aid in the choice of reporters for other types of
nanotags made of materials beyond Au, and for other sensing and imaging
applications beyond paper-based immunoassays. Thus, a general approach
for quantitatively evaluating a set of chosen reporters would facilitate
the design of Raman nanotags.

There are some drawbacks to the
use of the correlation matrix for
evaluating the spectral overlap of Raman reporters. The value of the
correlation depends on the spectra region of interest and is calculated
based on normalized spectra. In theory, there may be cases where two
spectra have nearly identical spectra but possess two highly prominent
peaks that are distinct, making it easy to distinguish one another.
In this case, the correlation value could be overestimated. Nevertheless,
the correlation value provides a quantitative measure of overlap,
providing an improvement over typical approaches, which often involve
estimation by eye, which is difficult to scale up to more than 2 or
3 reporters. Thus, while it is not optimal, it can still be used as
a guide and/or initial screen for choosing reporters.

Other
areas of improvement could be in the stability of GNS, which
are sometimes observed to reshape over time under certain conditions.
However, GNS stability is improved by surface functionalization and
biomolecular conjugation.19 Furthermore,
using a full LFA format could also aid GNS stability where the nanotags
would be dried down into a conjugate pad along with stabilization
molecules.

Synthesis and
Conjugation of Nanostars
GNS were synthesized
using a previously described method.31 Briefly,
9 mL of 140 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) was mixed with 1 mL of 18 MΩ deionized
(Milli-Q) water, followed by the addition of 80 μL of 10 mg/mL
HAuCl4·3H2O and further vortexing. The
solution sat undisturbed for 1 h for the nanostar formation. Afterward,
GNSs were separated from excess reagents by centrifugation at 4000
rcf for 20 min. The supernatant was then removed, and the nanostar
pellet was resuspended in 5 mL of Milli-Q water. Then, the solution
was divided into five equal parts of 1 mL, one for each Raman reporter.
The Raman reporter molecule of interest was added and vortexed, 2.15
μL of BPE, 20 μL of MBA, 15 μL DCT, 30 μL
PCTP, and 2.5 μL DTNB, to have approximately a reporter monolayer
on the nanostars’ surface, assuming a maximal footprint of
70.18, 49.89, 38.52, 47.09, and 73.75 Å2 for each
reporter, respectively, calculated with MarvinSketch, and so, that
they have similar SERS intensity. The solution was left undisturbed
for 30 min and was further centrifuged for 20 min at 4000 rcf for
20 min and then resuspended in 1 mL Milli-Q water. For antibody conjugation,
10 μL of 4.4 mg/mL Ab was added to each nanostars’ solution
previously prepared, and the resulting solution was vortexed and further
shaken overnight at room temperature. Afterward, 100 μL of 10–5 M mPEG 5 kDa was added to each sample, vortexed and
further shaken for 30 min. Last, the solutions were centrifuged at
4000 rcf for 20 min to remove excess reagents and were then ready
for use.

GNS Characterization
Optical absorption spectra of
the GNPs were obtained on a SpectraMax M5 plate reader (Molecular
Devices). Morphology of the GNS was characterized with a FEI Tecnai
G2 TEM at 120 kV. ImageJ was used to process TEM images and measure
the dimensions of the GNS. In addition, a Zetasizer Nano ZS from Malvern
Instruments was used to measure the hydrodynamic diameter (DH) and the ζ of plain GNS and their Ab
conjugates. A micro BCA test was performed to quantify the antibody
attached to GNS and was used to quantify the amount of antibody bound
per nanoparticle. Briefly, 150 μL of sample were mixed with
150 μL of BCA reagent (prepared as stated in Thermo Fisher micro
BCA protocol) in a 96-well plate. The standard curve was performed
with initial concentrations of 50 μg/mL of BSA with subsequent
twofold dilutions to obtain 7 points. Both samples and standards were
incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Absorbance at 562 nm was read in
a plate reader.

Raman Spectroscopy
Raman and SERS
spectra were acquired
using a Raman Senterra II microscope (Bruker Optiks GmbH, Germany).
A Ne laser with a power of 1 mW operating at λ = 785 nm was
utilized as the excitation source. A thermoelectrically cooled CCD
detector was coupled to a spectrograph. SERS measurements across the
test area were obtained using a point-by-point mapping mode. A computer-controlled
translational stage was used to scan an area of 2 × 2 mm in 130
μm × 130 μm steps with a 20× objective lens.
The data integration time at each point was 5 s with five co-additions.
The numerical aperture of the objective lens used was 50 × 1000
μm. The spectra acquired for each spot were decoded using OPUS
software v 7.0 (Bruker Optiks GmbH, Germany). The baselines of each
spectra were corrected by concave Rubberband correction method using
15 iterations and 64 baseline points. Mathematical calculations on
the spectra such as spectra averaging, intensity, area, or peak shift
measurements were performed in Matlab.

Dipstick Assay
Dipstick assays consisted of nitrocellulose
strip with immobilized antibodies attached to an absorbent pad as
a wick. Antibodies were immobilized on the nitrocellulose strip by
manually pipetting 0.3 μL of a 2 mg/mL solution of antibody
onto the nitrocellulose paper and further allowed to dry for at least
30 min. In the test area, polyclonal anti-human IgG antibodies were
immobilized. The control line was spotted with goat antibody that
could bind to the Fc fragment of the mouse IgG antibodies on the GNS.
To run the test, the strip was submerged at its lower end in the test
solution containing 4 μL of 50 w/v % sucrose in water, 8 μL
of 1 v/v % Tween 80 in PBS, 1 μL of the GNS–Ab conjugates,
BSA, and the analyte (IgG), rendering a total volume of 45 μL.
Then, the solution migrated through the strip upward via capillary
action to the absorbent pad attached to the upper end of the strip.
When all of the solution had been absorbed, the strip was washed with
80 μL of 0.1 v/v % Tween 80 in PBS through the same procedure
to eliminate unbound conjugates and allowed to dry. Wash or diluent
steps are commonly used in commercially available LFAs.39

Machine Learning
NNLS finds the
weights of the linear
combination of spectra from the pure components contained in the sample
that minimizes the squared difference with the spectrum of the sample.
For individual samples with just one nanotag, the SERS signal was
considered to have 6 components: BPE, MBA, DCT, PCTP, DTNB, and nitrocellulose.
NNLS of the six components from 800 to 1800 cm–1 was performed in Matlab. For each strip, the NNLS analysis was carried
out to estimate the contribution of the reporters in each scanning
measurement. The detection capabilities of the approach were assessed
by using a LDA classifier with a Monte Carlo cross-validation scheme.
To train the classifier, 15 spectra of each sample were used. Then,
to test the classifier, five spectra from each sample were randomly
picked, a process that was repeated 200 times and the results of each
iteration were aggregated. For mixtures with more than one nanotag,
nitrocellulose contribution was neglected in the LS algorithm, as
GNS concentration is higher on the strip and thus nitrocellulose signal
was not detected. A separate classifier was used for these mixtures,
and its training and testing was performed as aforementioned.

The confusion matrix was calculated using Matlab Neural Network toolbox,
which provides the accuracy or TPR (%) and the negative false rate
(%) for each sample and for the overall performance classifying the
12 mixtures. The TPR or accuracy for each sample equals to the sum
of positively classified elements divided by the total number of events
(1000 each sample), whereas the FNR is the percentage of the wrongly
classified elements from the total. Similarly, the overall accuracy
is equal to the sum of the diagonal elements (correctly classified
cases) divided by the total number of cases (diagonals + off-diagonals).40
