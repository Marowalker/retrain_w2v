Most
of the common redox mediators such as organic dyes and cyanide
ligand-associated metal complex systems that have been used for various
electrochemical applications are hazardous nature. Sesamol, a vital
nutrient that exists in natural products like sesame seeds and oil,
shows several therapeutic benefits including anticancer, antidiabetic,
cardiovascular protective properties, etc. Herein, we introduce a
new electrochemical redox platform based on a sesamol derivative,
sesamol-quinone (Ses-Qn; oxidized sesamol), prepared by the in situ
electrochemical oxidation method on a carbon nanoblack chemically
modified glassy carbon electrode surface (GCE/CB@Ses-Qn) in pH 7 phosphate
buffer solution, for nontoxic and sustainable electrochemical, electroanalytical,
and bioelectroanalytical applications. The new Ses-Qn-modified electrode
showed a well-defined redox peak at Eo = 0.1 V vs Ag/AgCl without any surface-fouling behavior. Following
three representative applications were demonstrated with this new
redox system: (i) simple and quick estimation of sesamol content in
the natural herbal products by electrochemical oxidation on GCE/CB
followed by analyzing the oxidation current signal. (ii) Utilization
of the GCE/CB@Ses-Qn as a transducer, bioelectrocatalytic reduction,
and sensing of H2O2 after absorbing the horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-based enzymatic system on the underlying surface.
The biosensor showed a highly selective H2O2 signal with current sensitivity and detection limit values 0.1303
μA μM–1 and 990 nM, respectively, with
tolerable interference from the common biochemicals like dissolved
oxygen, cysteine, ascorbic acid, glucose, xanthine, hypoxanthine,
uric acid, and hydrazine. (iii) Electrochemical immunosensing of white
spot syndrome virus by sequentially modifying primary antibody, antigen,
secondary antibody (HRP-linked), and bovine serum albumin on the redox
electrode, followed by selective bioelectrochemical detection of H2O2.

1 Introduction
Searching
of new redox-active organic molecules that are derived
from natural resources for electrochemical applications is a recent
trend in the sustainable and advanced electrochemical research area.1−5 In this context, nonhazardous and ecofriendly redox-active molecules
are pressingly needed for pollution-free electrochemical applications.
Most often, redox systems such as quinone,2,4 organic
dyes,6−9 metals,10−12 metal oxides,13−15 complexes like Fe(CN)63–,16−19 and organometallic systems like ferrocene and its derivatives19−21 have been used as homogeneous/heterogeneous mediators for various
electrochemical, electro-organic, and electroanalytical applications.
Indeed, these redox chemicals have been considered as hazardous, toxic,
and environment polluting substances.22−27 For instance, hydroquinones are reported to be hematotoxic and carcinogenic
agents associated with malignancy in occupational environments.28−30 Similarly, ferricyanide, which is a benchmark redox system, releases
the deadly toxic hydrogen cyanide gas when exposed to an acidic environment.31,32 Even ferrocene complex exposure led to cirrhotic changes in liver,
affecting erythrocytes in animals.33 Thus,
environmental impacts have become a major factor that discourage the
use of the above-mentioned common redox systems. On the other hand,
redox-active systems derived from natural resources such as herbs,
phytochemicals, and spices have now gained recognition as an environmentally
benign and sustainable system in electrochemistry.34,35 Nevertheless, the reported natural redox systems such as curcumin-quinone,
gingerol, and quercitin have been restricted for simple electrochemical
oxidation and reduction reactions.36,37 The complexity
and electroinactive character of natural products are the major limitations.
Herein, we report a highly stable, ecofriendly, and biocompatible
redox-active sesamol derivative, sesamol-1,4-quinone (Ses-Qn), prepared
by in situ electrochemical oxidation of sesamol on an abundant carbon
nanoparticle material, carbon black, as a surface-confined system
(GCE/CB@Ses-Qn) for bioelectrocatalytic reduction of hydrogen peroxide
and electrochemical immunosensing of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV)
applications.

Sesamol (3,4-methylenedioxyphenol), a vital herb
obtained from
sesame seeds,38,39 has been used as a phytonutrient
and shows ayurvedic medicinal activities like antioxidant,40,41 antifungal,42 antidiabetic,43 anticancer,44,45 cardioprotective,46 etc. There have been some reports related to
the electrochemical activity of the phenolic site in sesamol like
electrochemical oxidation and antioxidant studies in acidic or semiaqueous
(CH3CN + H2O) medium.47,48 In this work, an effort has been made to convert sesamol as a surface-confined
redox-active compound, Ses-Qn, on the CB material surface. The new
Ses-Qn-modified electrode system showed a well-defined redox peak
at an apparent standard electrode potential, Eo′ = 0.1 V vs Ag/AgCl, in pH 7 phosphate buffer (PB)
solution corresponding to the electron-transfer reaction of the quinone
derivative of sesamol (Ses-Qn). It has been identified that the oxidative
cleavage of the methylene dioxo bridge in sesamol followed by generation
of new redox-active quinone has occurred in a new electrochemical
preparation step adopted in this work (Scheme 1). The NMR spectroscopic technique has been
used to identify the critical functional group transformation that
has occurred in situ on the electrode surface. It is noteworthy that
the core structure of Ses-Qn resembles the structure of some of the
natural products, for example, 2-methoxy-6-heptyl-1,4-benzoquinone
and 2-methoxy-6-pentyl-1,4-benzoquinone, 5-(1,1-dimethylprop-2-enyl)-2-(3-methylbut-2-enyl),
and cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione that are isolated from Miconia lepidota leaves and New Zealand brown alga Perithalia capillaris.49 The present work covers the preparation, physicochemical characterization,
and three different electrochemical applications of the sesamol redox
coupled modified electrode. These applications include (i) selective
detection of sesamol content in sesame seeds (black seed, #1 and white
seed, #2) and oils (#3–#5); (ii) biocatalytic reduction and
sensing of H2O2 utilizing the horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-based enzyme system immobilized electrode; and (iii) analysis
of electrochemical immunosensing of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV),
by integrating with the primary (Ab1) and secondary (Ab2-HRP) antibodies
on the electrode surface.

Inset is the plausible electron-transfer
shuttling reaction scheme.

For biosensing
of hydrogen peroxide, in general, redox mediators
like methylene blue and ferricyanide (Zobell solution) coupled with
the HRP enzyme and Au nanoparticles have been frequently used.50−54 Unfortunately, complicated preparation procedures and use of hazardous
(conventional redox systems) and expensive chemicals (Au nanoparticles)
restrict the assays for further applications. Note that the covalent
linkers such as 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (EDC-NHS) have been widely adopted
for covalent linkage of amino and carboxylic functional groups on
the modified electrode surface.50,51,54 Furthermore, the functionalization procedure takes about 3–6
h of working time to complete the reaction.55 In this work, we simplified the procedure and immobilized the antibody
without any EDC-NHS linker on the GCE/CB@Ses-Qn.

White spot
syndrome virus (WSSV) is one of the devastating viral
infections in penaeid shrimp.50,56 It creates huge loss
to the aquaculture industry. Early detection of the virus by quick
and simple analytical methodology is direly needed to save from the
loss. Conventionally, the polymerase chain reaction, gene therapy,
and DNA microarray methods have been frequently used for the detection
of WSSV (vp28 protein).57−59 Unfortunately, the assays are
less sensitive, require several offline sample preparations, and involve
hazardous chemicals (ethylene bromide) and time-consuming procedures
(∼12 h). Alternately, the electrochemical platform provides
a wonderful tool for the development of electronic-gadget-based biosensor
systems. Previously, our group demonstrated the methylene blue dye-based
electrochemical immunosensor assay for the WSSV.46 In this work, GCE/CB@Ses-Qn has been used as a transducer
to study the electrochemical immunosensing of WSSV. Note that CB is
an ultra-low-cost carbon material that has been prepared as a bulk
from hydrocarbons (oil and natural gas) and used as an ingredient
in the tyre industry.60 The CB material
is found to be optimal for the immobilization of Ses-Qn in this work.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Carbon
black (N330 grade)
was obtained as a gift sample from Phillips Carbon Black Ltd. Kochi,
India. Sesamol (∼95% purity), activated carbon (99.95%), carboxylic
acid-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotube (f-MWCNT, >80%
carbon
basis; >8% carboxylic acid functionalization), MWCNT (∼95%
purity assay; outer diameter size, 10–15 nm; inner diameter
size, 2–6 nm; length, 0.1–10 mm), single-walled carbon
nanotube (SWCNT; ∼70% purity on carbon basis, size 0.7–1.1
nm diameter), double-walled carbon nanotube (DWCNT; 50–80%
carbon basis), bovine serum albumin (BSA), and graphene oxide (GO)–ethanol
dispersed stock solution (5 mg mL–1, ∼80%
carbon basis; flake size, 0.5–2.0 μm; thickness, 0.6–1.2
nm; purity, 99%) were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Anhydrous
sodium dihydrogen phosphate (≥98% purity) and anhydrous disodium
hydrogen phosphate (≥98% purity) were obtained from Merck,
Germany. The pH 7 phosphate buffer (PB) solution of 0.1 M ionic strength
was used as a supporting electrolyte throughout this study. Sesame
seeds of black (#1) and white (#2) varieties and different brands
of sesame oils (#3–#5) were collected from a local supermarket
at Vellore. The WSSV gene (vp28) was obtained from Xcelris, India.
The secondary antibody (Ab2-HRP conjugate; goat-raised anti-rabbit)
was obtained from Genei, Bangalore, India. The primary antibody, anti-mouse
vp28 polyclonal antibody (raised in rabbit), was obtained as a gift
from Professor A. S. Sahul Hameed, Abdul Hakeem College, India. The
aqueous solutions were prepared using double-distilled water. Because
dissolved oxygen is not interfering, no effort is made to remove oxygen
from the test solution.

2.2 Apparatus
Cyclic
voltammetry (CV)
measurements were carried out with a CHI model 660 C electrochemical
workstation. The conventional three-electrode system consisted of
the glassy carbon electrode (GCE; 0.0707 cm2 area) and
its chemically modified electrode as a working electrode, Ag/AgCl
(in 3 M KCl) as a reference electrode, and platinum as a counter electrode
using 10 mL working volume. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic
measurements were performed using a JASCO 4100 instrument (Japan)
with KBr. The proton NMR was recorded on Bruker 400 MHz using CDCl3 as a solvent.

2.3 Sesamol-Quinone-Modified
Electrode Preparation
First, GCE was cleaned and polished
using an alumina powder kit,
followed by electrochemical pretreatment (in a window of −0.2–1.2
V vs Ag/AgCl at a scan rate (v) of 50 mV s–1 for
20 cycles) in pH 7 PB solution. Five microliters of 3 mg CB-dispersed
ethanol (1 mL) was drop-casted on the GCE surface and left for drying
for about 2 ± 1 min at room temperature (25 °C). Then, the
GCE/CB@Ses-Qn-modified system was prepared by CV potential cycling
of GCE/CB in a dilute (100 μM) sesamol dissolved pH 7 PB solution
in a window of −0.2–0.6 V Ag/AgCl continuously for 20
cycles at v = 50 mV s–1. In a similar way, other
carbon nanomaterial-modified Ses-Qn samples were prepared

2.4 Sampling of Sesame Seeds and Oils
Briefly, 10 mg of
weighed seeds and oils placed separately in a round
bottom flask containing 40 mL of MeOH was subjected to refluxing with
constant stirring for ∼120 min in an oil bath maintained at T = 55 °C.39−41 A yellowish methanol layer, which
contains the sesamol compound, was filtered using Whatman Filter paper
and subjected to electroanalysis after appropriate dilution in pH
7 PB solution by the standard addition method using the differential
pulse voltammetric (DPV) technique. Following are the DPV conditions:
initial potential = 0.0 V; final potential = 0.8 V; increment potential
= 0.004 V; amplitude = 0.05 V; pulse width = 0.2 s; and pulse period
= 0.5 s.

2.5 Procedure for Electrochemical Immunosensing
Following is the stepwise procedure adopted for the analysis (Scheme 1C–F): step
1; 1 μL of Ab1 from a stock solution, 1 mg mL–1, was drop-casted directly on GCE/CB@Ses-Qn, followed by 1% w/v (1
mg in mL–1) BSA, and dried at room temperature (25
°C) for 5 min. This electrode is denoted GCE/CB@Ses-Qn/Ab1-BSA.
The BSA used here is to block the surface active-sites (which are
nonspecific) to Ab1 to avoid false response. The above electrode was
washed twice with double-distilled water to remove the excess primary
antibody and BSA physisorbed on the electrode surface. Step 2; 1 μL
of antigen stock ([Ag] = 1.31 × 108 copies μL–1) was coated, dried, and again washed (GCE/CB@Ses-Qn/Ab1-BSA-Ag).
Step 3; 1 μL of secondary antibody, which is a primary-antibody-linked
HRP (Ab2-HRP) from the stock solution, 1 mg in mL–1, was coated on the electrode surface (GCE/CB@Ses-Qn/Ab1-BSA-Ag-Ab2-HRP),
dried at room temperature for 5 min, and washed with double-distilled
water to remove the excess Ab2-HRP. In total, 15 min time is required
for the biosensor preparation. The above biosensor was subjected to
CV study in the absence and presence of 500 μM H2O2 at v = 10 mV s–1. Depending on the Ag concentration (1.31 × 10–3 to 1.31 × 107 copies μL–1), variable H2O2 sensing currents were obtained.
As controls, uninfected fish muscle and BF-2 (infectious pancreatic
necrosis virus (IPNV) obtained from fish gills) were analyzed directly
casting the crushed test sample on the sensor electrode in place of
Ag in the electrochemical immunosensor preparation procedure. The
preparation procedure of the control-modified electrode is similar
to the GCE/CB@Ses-Qn-Ab1-BSA-Ag-Ab2-HRP procedure (Scheme 1).

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Electrochemical Response
of Sesamol on GCE/CB
The initial experiment was carried out
using unmodified GCE with
100 μM standard sesamol compound in pH 7 PB solution, as in Figure 1A, curve a. An unstable
irreversible peak at the anodic side, Epa 0.35 V (A1), followed by an unstable reversible peak at apparent
standard electrode potential, Eo′
= 0.10 V vs Ag/AgCl (A2/C2), were noticed. After the experiment, when
the working electrode was gently washed with the electrolyte, CV was
performed in a blank pH 7 PB solution, and there was no marked current
signal for the redox peaks noticed (Figure 1A, curve b). This result indicates the adsorptionless
voltammetric response of sesamol on the GCE surface. When the same
experiment was repeated on GCE/CB, as in Figure 1B, well-defined electrochemical signals corresponding
to A1 and A2/C2 peaks similar to those in the GCE-sesamol case but
with about 100× higher current signal were noticed. The A2/C2
current signal was found to be increased with cycle number up to 20,
followed by saturation in the response, whereas the A1 peak signal
was diminished in the second cycle and get saturated. Interestingly,
when the above working electrode was medium transferred to a blank
pH 7 PB solution and CV was performed, as in Figure 1C, curve b, the A2/C2 redox peak was found
to be retained with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 1.3% (n = 20), indicating good stability of the chemically modified
electrode. There was no sign of the A1 signal on the modified electrode
surface. The peak-to-peak potential difference was calculated as follows,
ΔEp = Epa – Epc, wherein Epa and Epc are anodic and
cathodic peak potentials, respectively, and surface excess (Γ)
values are 50 ± 2 mV and 58.37 × 10–9 mol
cm–2, respectively. The effect of scan rate on the
redox peak showed a regular increase in the peak current signals,
as in Figure 2A. Plots
of ipa and ipc versus scan rate were nearly linear, suggesting surface-confined
electron-transfer behavior of the modified electrode (Figure 2C). Applying the Laviron theory
under the condition ΔEp < 200
mV (Figure 2D),61 the heterogeneous electron-transfer rate constant, ks, was calculated using the following equation, m = (RT/F)(ks/nν), where F is Faraday’s constant, 96 500, R is
the gas constant 8.314, n is the number of electrons
in the rate-determining step, ν is the scan rate in V s–1, and T is 298 K, and was found to
be 1.75 s–1 at ν = 100 mV s–1 and ΔEp = 63 mV (transfer coefficient,
α = 0.5). The obtained ks value
is nearly equal to the values reported for the hemoglobin enzyme and
metal complex-modified electrodes, 0.28 s–1 (MWCNT–Fe:NH2–chitosan for H2O2 reduction)62 and 1.21 s–1 (metal-porphyrin-based
biomimetic system for H2O2 reduction). On the
basis of the electrochemical observation, it can be speculated that
the oxidized species of sesamol (Ses-Oxid) gets immobilized on the
GCE/CB and shows the surface-confined redox peak in this work. The
modified electrode is tentatively denoted as GCE/CB@Ses-Oxid.

3.2 Effect of Carbon Nanomaterial on the Electrochemical
Response of Sesamol
Aiming at understanding the effect of
surface on Ses-Oxid formation, various carbon nanomaterials like graphene
oxide, single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT), double-walled carbon
nanotube (DWCNT), MWCNT, and carboxylic acid-functionalized MWCNT
(f-MWCNT) were examined for sesamol electrochemical reaction (i.e.,
GCE/carbon@Ses-Oxid), as in Figure 3A–G. The experiments were conducted similar
to Figure 1A,B. In
all of the modified electrode cases, qualitatively similar voltammetric
redox peak response at Eo′ = ∼0.1
± 0.01 V vs Ag/AgCl was noticed. With respect to the relative
A2 peak current value, the order of sesamol immobilization on the
carbon nanomaterials can be sequenced as follows: CB > f-MWCNT
> SWCNT
> GO > DWCNT > activated charcoal (AC) > MWCNT (Figure 3). Following conclusions
can be made from
the observed result: (i) graphitic structure is necessary for electrochemical
immobilization of sesamol as a redox confined system. (ii) Single-layered
carbon nanomaterial provides better environment (surface orientation
of the immobilized biomatrix and redox mediator) than the multiwalled
carbon nanotube for electrochemical reaction modification. The exact
interaction details are still not known. (iii) Oxygen-functionalized
MWCNT and graphene oxide systems have a positive effect on the sesamol
electrochemical oxidation reaction and immobilization. There might
be a strong hydrogen bonding interaction between the hydroxyl/functional
group of Ses-Oxid with COOH and OH functional groups of CB, apart
from the π–π interaction on the modified electrode
surface. Considering the highest current signal and surface excess
values of sesamol loading, CB has been chosen as optimal for further
experiment. At this stage, it is difficult to propose what type of
sesamol-organic molecule is immobilized on CB and showed the redox
feature. Several physicochemical and electrochemical characterizations
were further carried out to confirm the product formed on the surface.

GCEs (GCE/carbon@Ses-Qn) in pH 7 PB solution at ν = 50 mV s–1. Plot of % of ipa alteration

carbon nanotube; AC = activated charcoal; DWCNT = double-walled carbon
nanotube; GO = graphene oxide; SWCNT = single-walled carbon nanotube;
f-MWCNT = carboxylic acid-functionalized MWCNT; CB = carbon nanoblack.

3.3 Physicochemical
Characterization of CB@Ses-Oxid
Figure 4A shows
a comparative Raman spectroscopic response of CB and CB@Ses-Oxid that
have been modified on screen-printed carbon electrodes. Specific Raman
signals corresponding to D (due to the sp3 carbon) at 1351
cm–1 and G bands (due to sp2 carbon)
at 1568 cm–1 were noticed. The calculated intensity
ratios of the band, ID/IG, are 0.22 for CB and 0.35 for CB@Ses-Oxid. The increment
of the ID/IG ratio indicates the conversion of part of the sp2 carbon
to sp3, which may be due to creation of oxygen functional
groups on the modified electrode surface. In this context, generation
of oxygen functional group on the sesamol-modified CB is the likely
reason for the observation. FT-IR analysis is further used to assign
the functional groups formed on the modified electrode surface. Figure 4B shows a typical
comparative FTIR response of CB, Ses, and CB@Ses-Oxid/KBr systems.
For this experiment, the respective GCE-modified electrodes were carefully
scratched out and mixed with KBr for the analysis. The blank sesamol
compound showed specific IR signals at 3202 cm–1 (C=CH; stretching), 2896 cm–1 (alkyl C–H
stretching), 1619 cm–1 (C=C; aromatic stretching),
1475 cm–1 (>C–O; symmetric stretch in
dioxo-bridged
carbon), and 1390 cm–1 (νCH2; stretching),
whereas CB@Ses-Oxid showed signals at 3626 cm–1 (νO–H),
3292 cm–1 (νC=CH; alkene stretching),
2845 cm–1 (νO–CH3; methoxy
group), 1680 cm–1 (νC=O; carbonyl),
1365 cm–1 (νC–O; ether stretching),
and 1550 cm–1 (νC=C–C=O;
α–β unsaturated ketone). The peak corresponding
to 2077 cm–1 is due to some impurity (adsorbed CO2 while measuring the IR signals). Note that new IR signals
due to νO–H and ν(α–β unsaturated
ketone) were observed specifically with the Ses-Oxid-modified electrode,
which confirms the presence of a quinone motif on the modified electrode.63 To further confirm the structure, the modified
electrode prepared by the bulk method, active-site extracted with
methanol, filtered multiple times and dried sample was subjected to
NMR analysis carefully as in Figure 4. Prior to the experiment, the sample was subjected
to thin-layer chromatography, showing two spots (data not shown) for
the positive response to the electrochemical oxidation reaction. As
can been seen in Figure 4D, the proton NMR spectrum of the pure sesamol in CDCl3 showed characteristic signals (δ) at 6.78 ppm (doublet, 1H;
aromatic hydrogen at C7), 6.45 ppm (singlet, 1H; aromatic hydrogen
at C2), 6.35 ppm (doublet, 1H; aromatic hydrogen at C6), 5.95 ppm
(singlet, 2H; dioxo methylene bridge; C4), and 4.74 ppm (broad singlet,
1H). However, for the electrochemically oxidized sesamol, the signal
was noticed at 3.8 (singlet, 3H; methoxy; C3), 7.52 (singlet, 1H;
C2), 7.35–7.45 (merged, dd, 2H; C5 and C6) corresponding to
the dearomatized alkene protons (Figure 4C). The absence of the characteristic methylene
bridge and aromatic proton but the appearance of a specific methoxy
peak in the latter case (Figure 4C) indicate the cleavage of C–O bond, leading
to the formation of a methoxy-substituted quinone product (Scheme 1A,B). On the basis
of the collective physicochemical and spectrochemical characterization
studies, it is revealed that the dioxo-bridge bond in sesamol is cleaved
to respective phenol, which is then oxidized in situ as the respective
quinone derivative on the underlying surface. Scheme 2 provides a plausible reaction pathway for
the electrochemical oxidation of sesamol on the GCE/CB-modified electrode.
It is visualized in case 1 that during the process of electron shifting,
the sesamol intermediate molecule prefers to delocalize the electron
and cleave the methylene dioxy bridge to form a sesamol-1,4-quinone
derivative. As can be seen from case 2, sesamol is regenerated due
to delocalization of electron within the aromatic system. As far as
case 3 is concerned, a nonpreferred pathway, the formation of 1,3-quinone,
is restricted due to resonance destabilization associated with 1,3-quinone.
In fact, in our previous independent studies on electrochemical oxidation
of phenol on the carbon nanotube-modified electrode showed selective
formation of 1,4-diquinone as the final product.64 On the basis of the information, it can be confirmed that
sesamol oxidation on the GCE/CB surface resulted in the formation
of the sesamol-1,4-diquinone derivative as a surface-confined product.64 From this point onward, the GCE/CB@Ses-Oxid
is redesigned as GCE/CB@Ses-Qn, wherein Ses-Qn = sesamol-1,4-quinone
product.

3.4 Application
1: Sesamol Nutritive Content Estimation
Conventionally, high-performance
liquid chromatography-coupled
spectroscopic methods have been used for the estimation,65,66 which are time consuming (∼30 min per injection) and involve
several offline preparation procedures. Herein, we introduce a differential
pulse voltammetry-based quick quantification technique (∼1
min per scan) for sesamol nutrient content estimation in the herbal
products. For this analysis, the extracted real samples were directly
spiked into pH 7 PB solution without (R) and with standard concentrations
of sesamol (R + Sn). Figure 5A–D shows typical DPV responses of the sesame seed
(#1) and oil (#3–#5) samples tested by the DPV approach. The
original spike of the test samples showed signals at A1 (#1) and/or
A2 (#3–#5) potentials with different current values. Depending
on the nature of organic matter, different voltammetric responses
(A1 or A1 and A2) were noticed. The DPV peak potential values noticed
resemble with the respective values of the standard sesamol tested
by the CV technique (Figure 1C). Upon spiking the standard alteration in A1 and/or A2,
peak current signals were noticed. This observation confirms the appropriate
quantification analysis of sesamol content in the real samples. Supporting
Information Table S1 provides the analytical
data of these assays. Note that the entire standard addition analysis
can be done in 5 ± 1 min. On the basis of the linear equation
and from the standard samples, contents of sesamol in the real systems
were estimated as 352, 27.4, 213, and 278 mg per 100 g in commercial
seed (#1) and oil (#3–#5) samples, which are comparable to
the values 34.2–613 mg/100 g sesamol content in various sesame
seeds and other products determined by conventional techniques (Supporting
Information, Table S1).38−40 On the basis
of the standard spikes, calculated recovery values of the assays are
∼100%, indicating the suitability of the present work for various
real sample analyses.

3.5 Application 2: Bioelectrocatalytic Reduction
and Sensing of Hydrogen Peroxide
For this, Ab2-HRP was used
as a bioenzyme system and immobilized on the GCE/CB@Ses-Qn as GCE/CB@Ses-Qn/Ab2-HRP.
The modified electrode was prepared by simple drop-casting of a dilute
solution of Ab2-HRP, incubation at room temperature for 5 ± 1
min, washing with double-distilled water, and drying. It is expected
that carboxylic acid functional groups of CB are involved in the coupling
reaction with the amino functional group of the Ab2-HRP site as an
amide linkage (Scheme 1). In our previous study on immobilization of polydopamine with carboxylic
group-functionalized MWCNT, we observed a covalent link formation
between them.67 In this work, we expect
that a similar kind of covalent bonding is formed. Meanwhile, the
mechanistic electron-transfer feature of the Ab2-HRP-modified electrode
was examined. The typical CV response of the GCE/CB@Ses-Qn/Ab2-HRP
(without H2O2) showed a redox peak similar to
that in the case of the GCE/CB@Ses, as shown in Figure 6. Comparative CV scan rate responses of GCE/CB@Ses-Qn
and GCE/CB@Ses-Qn/Ab2-HRP are displayed in Figure 2. The redox currents of the GCE/CB@Ses/Ab2-HRP
are varying nearly linearly with the scan rate, indicating the adsorption-controlled
electron-transfer feature of the modified electrode. Because the secondary
antibody-integrated, sesamol-quinone-modified electrode is a nonideal
system and contains fraction of electron-inactive protein, the ipc vs ν plot does not follow straight
line behavior. The calculated ΓSes values are 58.37
× 10–9 and 47.74 × 10–10 mol cm–2, respectively, for without and with Ab2-HRP.
On the basis of ΔEp = 73 mV for
GCE/CB@Ses-Ab2-HRP and referring to the Laviron equation,61 the calculated 1/m, α,
and ks values are 2.2 (m = 0.33), 0.5, and 1.28 ± 0.5 s–1, respectively.
When compared with the GCE/CB@Ses-Qn system, the enzyme-modified electrode
showed about 5% decrement in the kinetic parameter (ks) value, which may be due to the electroinactive character
of the Ab2-HRP. It is likely that the amino functional groups of Ab2-HRP
interacted with carboxylic functional groups without any covalent
linkers like EDC-NHS. Note that metal catalyst-assisted coupling of
amine and carboxylic acid groups has been reported in the literature.62,68 Plausibly, the trace metal impurities like Ni (0.18 wt %) and Fe
(0.42 wt %)69 in CB helps the amide linkage
formation on the modified electrode surface. Figure 6A, curve b, shows a typical CV response of
the enzyme electrode with 500 μM H2O2.
As can be seen, specific increment in the reduction current signal
where the A2/C2 peak exists was noticed. As a control experiment,
GCE/CB@Ses-Qn without any Ab2-HRP was subjected to H2O2, as shown in curve c in Figure 7A. There is no sign for the H2O2 reduction current with the above case, ensuring that
the electrochemical response observed is not due to the sesamol and
carbon matrix. This information confirms the bioelectrocatalytic reduction
of H2O2 coassisted (transducer) by the sesamol-Qn
redox system in this work. The possible mechanism for the bioelectrocatalytic
reaction is sketched in Scheme 1. Further experiments on the effect of concentration showed
a linear increase in the current values. Currents measured at 0 V
vs Ag/AgCl are uniformly taken for the quantitative analysis. The
constructed calibration plot was linear in a window of 0–700
μM with current sensitivity and regression coefficient values
0.0461 and 0.994 μA μM–1, respectively.
Furthermore, the amperometric i–t technique was adopted for the bioelectrochemical sensing of H2O2. Figure 6C–E shows the comparative responses of GCE/CB@Ses-Qn
(control) and GCE/CB@Ses-Qn/Ab2-HRP for the continuous sensing of
25 μM H2O2 spiked pH 7 PB solution. A
marked and regular increase in the current signal upon the H2O2 spike was noticed with the optimal electrode, whereas
the control system failed to display any response under similar conditions.
Thus, the study aids the idea of bioelectrocatalytic reduction by
the optimal electrode. Figure 6D describes the calibration plot using the amperometric i–t studies for the range 0–300
μM of H2O2, and the resulting current
sensitivity and regression coefficient values are 0.131 and 0.9998
μA μM–1, respectively. The relative
standard deviation (RSD) for 10 spikes is 2.6%. The calculated detection
limit is 990 nM. The detection limit value was better than the values
reported with the following biosensors: HRP/thionine/TiO2 nanotubes (1.1 μM),70 porous Au-nano/CaCO3/HPR (1 μM),71 and Au/sol–gel
SiO2/HPR (3 μM).72 The
biosensor found to be highly selective current signal to H2O2 without any interference from common biochemicals such
as cysteine (CysH), ascorbic acid (AA), glucose (Glu), xanthine (X),
hypoxanthine (HX), uric acid (UA), and hydrazine (Figure 6E).

and its typical corresponding calibration graph as inset.

3.6 Application-3: Electrochemical
Immunosensor
for WSSV
The fabrication of the electrochemical immunosensor
has been shown in Scheme 1D–F. Sequential modification of Ab1, BSA, Ag, and Ab2-HRP
and the corresponding CV responses without and with 500 μM H2O2 are displayed in Figure 7A–D. As can be seen, the controls,
GCE/CB@Ses-Qn, GCE/CB@Ses-Qn/Ab1, and GCE/CB@Ses-Qn/Ab1-BSA-Ag were
failed to show any bioelectrocatalytic current signal (negative response
was obtained), indicating the absence of any false positive response
noticed in this work (Figure 7E). CV of the electrochemical immunosensor, GCE/CB@Ses-Qn/Ab1-BSA-Ag-Ab2-HRP,
showed a sensitive bioelectrocatalytic response to H2O2. Upon increasing the Ag concentration (1.31 × 10–3 to 1.31 × 107 copies μL–1) in the electrochemical immunosensor construction,
a systematic increase in the bioelectrocatalytic H2O2 reduction current signal was noticed, indicating the sensitive
quantification analysis of the WSSV by the sesamol-based electrochemical
platform. As an important control experiment, proteins obtained from
fish muscle and IPNV were also modified on the electrode along with
the other sequencers (Figure 8) but failed to show any H2O2 bioelectrocatalytic
response evidencing the high specificity of the present electrochemical
sensor for the WSSV analysis. Overall, the Ses-Qn based electrochemical
platform is demonstrated to be the first, fair, elegant, novel and
efficient for the various bioelectrochemical applications.

4 Conclusions
Electrochemical oxidation of electroinactive sesamol to a highly
redox-active sesamol-quinone surface-confined system was achieved
on a carbon nanoblack-modified glassy carbon electrode surface in
pH 7 PB solution. The modified electrode showed a well-defined redox
peak at a standard electrode potential 0.1 V vs Ag/AgCl corresponding
to the quinone/hydroquinone redox-active site of the modified electrode
(i.e., sesamol-quinone). Physicochemical characterization of the modified
electrode and its extract by Raman and IR spectroscopic techniques
and NMR study revealed that the dioxo bond of the sesamol was cleaved
after the electrochemical preparation procedure, resulting in the
sesamol-quinone product on the working electrode surface. The new
electrochemical platform introduced in this work was extended to (i)
quantification of sesamol nutrient content in certain herbs (seed
and oil), wherein the herbal extract was directly spiked into pH 7
PB solution and the oxidation reaction was analyzed for the quantification
assays; (ii) bioelectrocatalytic reduction of H2O2 utilizing the sesamol-quinone as an ecofriendly transducer, for
a sensitive and selective amperometric signal for H2O2 with current sensitivity and detection limit values 0.131
μA μM–1 and 990 nM, respectively, without
any interference from common biochemicals such as H2O2, cysteine, ascorbic acid, glucose, xanthine, hypoxanthine,
uric acid, and hydrazine; (iii) electrochemical immunosensing of WSSV,
wherein sequential modification of primary antibody, BSA, antigen,
and secondary antibody on GCE/CB@Ses-Qn was performed and tested with
H2O2. The electrochemical immunosensor showed
a highly selective and specific current signal to WSSV in a concentration
window of 1.31 × 10–3 to 1.31 × 107 copies μL–1 and copied 0.92 μA
copy–1. Because the new electrochemical platform
introduced was based on a nontoxic, nonhazardous, and herbal product,
the approach can be used for a variety of electroanalytical and bioelectroanalytical
applications in a sustained manner. In summary, following are the
advantages of using sesamol as redox mediators: (i) the sesamol derivative
(Ses-Qn) used in this work is generated from a renewable source, i.e.,
a phytochemical, a naturally occurring plant product. (ii) It is of
low cost and quite easily available in the market. Hence, no additional
effort is needed to synthesize the molecule. (iii) It is a part of
a green chemistry approach, with no detrimental impact on the environment,
unlike common electron mediators such as thionine, methylene blue,
etc. that are a part of organic dyes and can be harmful to the flora
and fauna. (iv) This approach involves a step targeting sustainable
chemistry. Following is the limitation for this technique: (i) the
formation of Ses-Qn is “in situ”, i.e., the immobilization
of the derivative involves the electrochemical preparation step before
proceeding for the application work.
