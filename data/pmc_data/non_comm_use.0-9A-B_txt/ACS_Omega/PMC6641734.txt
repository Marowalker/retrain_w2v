Palladium is one
of the widely used precious metals toward catalysis,
energy, and environmental applications. Efficient recovery and reusability
of palladium from the spent catalysts is not only highly desirable
for sustainable industrial processing but also for preventing environmental
contamination. Here, we present a facile citrate-mediated amine functionalization
of alumina nanopowder (AO) in aqueous medium. The surface functionalization
is probed using infrared (IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),
thermogravimetric analysis, surface area, and zeta potential measurements.
The amine-functionalized sorbent is thoroughly studied for its vital
palladium-sorption parameters such as amount of adsorbent, pH, adsorption
capacity, thermodynamics, and kinetics. The palladium adsorption over
amine-functionalized AO is further characterized with X-ray diffraction
and XPS. IR analysis of palladium adsorbed over polyethyleneimine
is performed to elucidate the mechanistic insight on the role of nitrogen
in capturing palladium. The amine-functionalized sorbent after adsorbing
palladium is studied for the catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol
and Cr(VI) and hydrogen generation from ammonia borane, which demonstrated
its excellent catalytic activity and reusability toward energy and
environmental applications. The environmentally benign materials and
all-aqueous reactions employed in this work demonstrate the potential
of the strategy for efficient and economical industrial transformations
and waste-stream management.

Introduction
Palladium is one of
the important heavy metals that find extensive
usage in various catalytic applications such as coupling, hydrogenation,
hydrogen generation, oxidation, decarbonylation, and so forth.1−4 Several organic transformations that find widespread implications
in pharmaceutical and other chemical industries primarily use palladium
as one of the main catalysts. Albeit enormous efforts to find alternatives
are being pursued, palladium is still considered to be a dominant
candidate in many catalytic reactions till date. Some of the limitations
of palladium include its high cost, environmental toxicity at higher
concentrations, and limited natural availability.5,6 From
both environmental and cost perspectives, it is necessary to bring
the amount of palladium in the final effluents less than 5 mg L–1.5,6 Although toxicity of palladium
is not substantial, at higher concentrations, the kidney tissues are
more likely to be affected and recent facts testify that it perturbs
the mitochondrial respiratory chain, leading to cell death by depleting
cellular glutathione levels.7 Also, palladium
has the ability to be transported through plant roots and later could
enter into the food chain.8 Thus, it is
imperative to effectively utilize the available palladium in a sustainable
fashion and recover it successfully. The recovery of palladium could
be accomplished through liquid–liquid extraction and solid-phase
extraction processes. Among these, the solid-phase extraction is known
to be an economical and effectual strategy for the recovery of palladium
and other metal species.9−11

Development of efficient
adsorbents to recover palladium from the
spent catalysts and industrial wastes provides economical and sustainable
opportunities. In this regard, activated carbon and biopolymer-modified
activated carbon are reported for palladium and platinum removal.12 Precious metals such as Au(III), Pd(II), and
Pt(IV) are shown to be well-adsorbed onto the native graphene oxide.13 The interaction of sulfur ligands such as mercaptobenzothiazole14 and mercaptobenzimidazole15 with biopolymers such as cellulose and chitosan shows good
ability to adsorb and to recover palladium. Impregnation of ionic
liquid (Aliquat-336) onto a mesoporous silica matrix (SBA-15) is another
versatile adsorbent that has been utilized to recover palladium from
an industrial catalyst.16

Recently,
there is an increasing trend in using amine functionality
such as polyethyleneimine (PEI) toward environmental remediation as
it is a biocompatible polymer that has been widely used in various
biological applications including tissue engineering and drug delivery.17−20 While the linear PEI is mainly consisted of secondary amines, the
branched PEI possesses primary, secondary, and tertiary amine groups.
Because of the abundant nitrogen, PEI is also known for its polycationic
behavior. On a different note, alumina is an inert, cost-effective,
and non-toxic substance. The surface of alumina can be easily functionalized
with amines, carboxylic acid, thiols, and so forth to obtain the desired
property. The commercial availability of high surface area alumina
nanopowder (AO) makes it interesting to be used as a cost-effective
support.21 PEI coated onto alumina was
used as a sorbent with an adsorption capacity of 13 mg g–1.22 PEI-coated polysulfone/Escherichia coli has been studied recently as a biosorbent
for the sorption of Pd(II). Here, polysulfone was used as a polymer
matrix for immobilization of E. coli biomass and to enhance the adsorption capacity.23 Polyallylamine hydrochloride-modified E.
coli also has been studied for its Pd(II) sorption
efficiency.24 The utility of PEI-modified Corynebacterium glutamicum biomass as a sorbent25 has been reported for palladium recovery. Alumina
combined with (5-bromo-2-pyridylazo)-5-diethylaminophenol shows good
potential for the adsorptive removal of Pd(II) from different water
samples with the sorption capacity of 11.0 mg g–1.26N,N-Bis(salicylidene)1,2-bis(2-aminophenylthio)ethane anchored over
mesoporous silica was found to be efficient in adsorbing and sensing
Pd(II).27 Amine-functionalized TiO2 nanofibers obtained through electrospinning has been found
to effectively perform as a membrane for recovery of precious metals
such as Pd, Pt, and Rh.28 Palladium supported
onto amine-functionalized montmorillonite has also been used as a
catalyst toward regioselective synthesis of aurones and flavones.29 In this work, we chose high surface area AO
and functionalized it with PEI. It is with the aim that the nitrogen
moieties present in PEI can effectively interact with palladium, thereby
leading to efficient palladium recovery and its reusability in catalytic
applications. Furthermore, the surface functionalization and the catalytic
applications were carried out entirely in aqueous medium, thereby
offering an environmentally benign methodology.

Results and Discussion
The functionalization of the alumina nanosupport (AO) with PEI
was accomplished in a two-step synthesis, as depicted in Scheme 1. First, citrate
was chemically anchored over alumina nanosupport, followed by acidification
with acetic acid to achieve carboxyl surface functionalization. It
is envisaged that one of the carboxylate arms of the citrate gets
anchored onto the alumina surface, whereas the remaining two carboxylates
are free that can be converted to carboxylic acid upon acidification.
In the second step, these carboxyl groups on the surface of AO were
activated using well-known 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
(EDC)/N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) coupling reagents,
which facilitated covalent immobilization of PEI through amide bond
formation. This was accomplished by the dropwise addition of citrate-functionalized
AO (CA-AO) suspension to the PEI solution. The surface functionalization
was monitored through infrared (IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), surface area, and zeta potential
measurements.

Scheme 1 Pictorial Representation of Citrate-Mediated Amine
Functionalization
of AO
The IR measurements of pristine
AO, AO treated with sodium citrate
(SC-AO), CA-AO, and PEI-anchored AO (PEI-AO) were recorded to follow
the surface functionalization, and the spectra are plotted in Figure 1. As seen from the
figure, the pristine AO exhibited a broad band in the range of 400–1000
cm–1. A peak at 1636 cm–1 was
found in the commercial AO, which may be attributed to the AlOOH layer
on the surface.30 After functionalization
with SC (before acidification), the obtained SC-AO exhibited characteristic
asymmetric νas(COO–) and symmetric
νs(COO–) vibrational stretching
frequencies of surface-bound carboxylate at 1638 and 1401 cm–1, respectively. The separation of 237 cm–1 between
these two peaks indicates the bridging type of chelation of the −(COO–) groups over the adjacent metal centers in the AO
support. After acidification, the peak maxima in CA-AO are observed
at 1629, 1469, and 1417 cm–1. The narrowing of separation
between the asymmetric νas(COO–) and symmetric νs(COO–) with
an additional peak formation at 1468 cm–1 indicates
successful acidification.30−32 After immobilizing PEI onto CA-AO,
the νas(COO–) and νs(COO–) stretching peaks were found to be slightly
shifted to 1624 and 1405 cm–1, respectively. This
is indicative of amide bond formation through free −COOH groups,
whereas the remaining carboxylate groups remain chelated to the AO
support. The new peak at 1574 cm–1 due to N–H
stretching and a weak shoulder at 1075 cm–1 due
to C–N stretching of PEI indicate that the surface is covered
with amine functionalities because of the reaction between PEI and
the alumina surface.33 One may not exclude
the possibility of PEI getting coated over CA-AO through electrostatic
interaction. Thus, PEI could be immobilized partially through amide
bond as well as electrostatic interaction over CA-AO.22

Figure 1 FT-IR spectra of the pristine TSC, AO, SC-AO, CA-AO, and PEI-AO.

To corroborate the observation
from IR measurements, we performed
XPS measurements on CA-AO and PEI-AO (Figure 2). The survey scan spectrum of CA-AO revealed
that the presence of characteristic Al 2p, Al 2s, C 1s, and O 1s peaks
at the binding energies correspond to 73.5, 118.2, 285.0, and 530.7
eV, respectively.34 The C 1s narrow scan
further revealed that a significant portion of the carbon was possessing
higher binding energy because of the bonding with the electronegative
oxygen atoms. The deconvolution of the C 1s narrow scan showed a peak
at 288 eV that can be attributed to the −C=O(O) of the
carboxyl group.35 This clearly indicated
the presence of carboxylic acids on the surface of AO. The survey
scan spectrum of PEI-AO, in addition to the peaks observed with CA-AO,
revealed an additional N 1s peak at 399.1 eV, which was further resolved
in the narrow scan. These observations additionally substantiated
the successful surface functionalization of AO with PEI.

Figure 2 XPS survey
scan measurements on CA-AO and PEI-AO (A), C 1s narrow
scan measurements on CA-AO and PEI-AO (B), and N 1s narrow scan measurement
on PEI-AO (C).

The TGA of pristine AO,
CA-AO, and PEI-AO was performed to understand
the degradation profile of the organics present in the functionalized
alumina nanoparticles (Figure 3). The pristine AO exhibited a gradual mass loss up to 600
°C, the temperature at which the total mass loss was found to
be ∼6%. The mass loss study of the functionalized materials
revealed that the CA-AO possessed ∼11% of organics, whereas
the amount of organics present in the PEI-AO was in the range of ∼15%.
In both the cases, the major degradation started from ∼250
°C, which was nearly completed at ∼600 °C. The difference
in mass loss between the pristine AO and the functionalized AO indicates
the increment in the overall proportion of organics with each functionalization
step. Thus, the final proportion of citrate and PEI in the PEI-AO
is ∼5 and ∼4%, respectively.

Figure 3 Mass loss study on AO,
CA-AO, and PEI-AO using thermogravimetric
analysis.

The particle size analyses of
AO, CA-AO, and PEI-AO were performed
by the dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique to understand the
effect of surface functionalization in the particles’ hydrodynamic
radius. As seen in Figure 4, the pristine AO possessed an average size of ∼80
nm (with the peak maxima of ∼72 nm), which was increased to
∼135 nm for CA-AO. This increase in particle size indicates
some aggregation among the CA-AO. An additional peak centered at ∼420
nm indicates that a significant population of the particles is in
the aggregated form possibly because of the interaction between surface-bound
carboxylic groups. After functionalization of CA-AO with PEI, the
hydrodynamic radius of the resultant PEI-AO was found to be ∼79
nm, which indicates that the particles regained their original surface
after this step. Zeta potential measurements of these materials were
carried out to understand the change in the surface charge with each
surface functionalization (Figure S1).
It is well-known that the high acidic conditions would protonate the
surfaces that would give rise to positive zeta potential, whereas
the high alkaline conditions would render the surfaces negatively
charged and therefore lead to negative zeta potential. As expected,
in all three samples, at ∼pH 2, the surfaces possessed a positive
zeta potential that was switched to negative at ∼pH 12; however,
their respective magnitudes were found to be different, additionally
corroborating the functionalization. The isoelectric pH values of
pristine AO, CA-AO, and PEI-AO were found to be 6.3, 6.5, and 7.3,
respectively.

Figure 4 Size distribution analyses of AO, CA-AO, and PEI-AO using
DLS.

The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of
the pristine AO, CA-AO, and PEI-AO was measured to follow the change
in surface area as a function of surface functionalization. The surface
area of the pristine AO was found to be ∼141 m2/g,
whereas that of the CA-AO was found to be ∼104 m2/g. The reduction in surface area could be attributed to the aggregation
of carboxyl-functionalized AO during the acidification step. The surface
area of PEI-AO was found to be ∼155 m2/g. The high
value of surface area obtained after the PEI-functionalization step
indicates that the PEI chains did not suffer aggregation, possibly
because of the electrostatic repulsions between the amine groups.
Furthermore, it can also be attributed to the additional adsorption
sites provided by the surface-anchored organics. These results are
in line with the DLS observation.

The PEI-AO thus obtained was
studied for its palladium-sorption
properties. The Pd(II) adsorption as a function of pH and amount of
adsorbent revealed the optimal values to be 6.0 and 0.1 g, respectively
(Figure S2). Figure S2 shows that with the increase in the amount of adsorbent,
the % adsorption of Pd(II) significantly decreases. This unique behavior
could be attributed to the following reason. Generally, it is well-known
that adsorption–desorption is an equilibrium process. When
an adsorbate is strongly anchored over an adsorbent, the equilibrium
will be shifted toward adsorption, and therefore desorption will be
suppressed. The nature of adsorption is determined through the magnitude
of enthalpy of adsorption. In our case, the ΔH0 was found to be −103.63 kJ mol–1 (vide infra), which lies in the boundary between physisorption and
chemisorption. With an increase in the adsorbent dosage, there exists
a competition for Pd(II) between the PEI-AO nanopowders that shift
the equilibrium toward desorption. Hence, at higher adsorbent dosage,
the % Pd adsorption decreases.

For the isotherm studies, the
initial concentrations of Pd(II)
were varied from 40 to 300 mg L–1. The equilibrium
adsorption data were applied to two important isotherms (Langmuir
and Freundlich) from which we could obtain the various isotherm parameters.

The Langmuir isotherm model was used to comprehend the monolayer
adsorption on the homogeneous surface containing a limited number
of identical sites and to calculate the maximum adsorption capacity
of the adsorbent.36,37 This isotherm explains the relation
between the equilibrium concentration of palladium (Ce) and the amount adsorbed at equilibrium (qe) on the surface of PEI-AO. The maximum adsorption capacity q0 (amount of Pd(II) adsorbed per unit weight
of the adsorbent) and constant b were obtained from
the linear plot (Figure 5A). The linearized form for the Langmuir isotherm is shown in eq 1. 1  Using the above
equation, the maximum adsorption
capacity q0 was found to be 97.7 mg g–1 (R2 = 0.91). Suitability
of a particular adsorption isotherm could be inferred through an important
parameter called the dimensionless separation factor RL. This is given by the equation RL = 1/(l + bC0), where C0 is the initial concentration of Pd(II) in
mg L–1 and b is the Langmuir constant
(L mg–1). The value of b was found
to be 0.03 L mg–1. The value of RL less than 1 relates to satisfactory adsorption, whereas
the same when greater than 1 indicates reduced or unfavorable adsorption.38 The value of RL for
the adsorption of palladium over the PEI-AO adsorbent was found to
be 0.77, indicating the usefulness of the Langmuir isotherm in this
system.

Pd(II) over PEI-AO. Pseudo-first-order (C) and pseudo-second-order
(D) kinetics for the adsorption of Pd(II) over PEI-AO.

The Freundlich isotherm, based on sorption on a
heterogeneous surface,
is an alternative useful model to gauge the adsorption phenomena occurring
in dilute solutions.39,40 The linearized form for the Freundlich
isotherm is given in eq 2 2  In this
particular model, Ce is the equilibrium
concentration of the Pd(II) in mg
L–1, qe is the amount
of Pd(II) adsorbed at equilibrium in mg g–1, and KF and n are the Freundlich
constants for adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity, respectively. KF and n were obtained from
the slope and intercept of the Freundlich isotherm plots, respectively
(Figure 5B). The regression
coefficient R2 was found to be 0.90. The
Freundlich exponent n should fall in the range of
1–10 so as to predict the suitability of this isotherm16 for a particular adsorption process. The respective
values of n and KF were
calculated to be 1.61 and 5.12, respectively, implying the favorable
adsorption process. The Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm parameters
are given in Table 1.

The kinetics of the
palladium adsorption onto the PEI-AO surface
was studied using first-order41 and pseudo-second-order42 models, and the linearized equations are expressed
as given by eqs 3 and 4. 3   4  where qe and qt refers to the amount of palladium
adsorbed at equilibrium and time t with the first-
and second-order rate constants k1 and k2, respectively. By fitting the experimental
data through the plots of log(qe – qt) and t/qt against t (Figure 5C,D), we
obtain the kinetic parameters for the above two models. The adsorption
data follow well with the pseudo-second-order model as indicated by
the higher regression coefficient (Table 2). Further, the qe values obtained experimentally and from the pseudo-second-order
kinetic model were found to be 2.6362 and 2.5159 mg g–1, respectively. With the experimental and calculated qe values being quite agreeable, it proves the applicability
of the pseudo-second-order model in understanding the adsorption kinetics
of palladium onto the PEI-AO adsorbent. Also, the kinetics data revealed
the optimal equilibration time to be 50 min.

The sorption of Pd(II) onto the PEI-AO surface was
evaluated through
the thermodynamic studies involving Gibbs free energy (ΔG0), standard enthalpy change (ΔH0), and standard entropy change (ΔS0). These parameters were calculated (Table 3) from the temperature-dependent
adsorption data using the Van’t Hoff equations,43,44 as shown in eqs 5 and 6. 5   6  The Kc values
were obtained from the ratio of concentration of tetrachloropalladate(II)
anion adsorbed onto the PEI-AO adsorbent to that in the liquid phase
at equilibrium. The standard enthalpy and entropy changes were obtained
through the ln K against 1/T (Figure S3) plot. The negative ΔG0 substantiates the spontaneity of adsorption
of Pd(II) onto PEI-AO. The decrease in ΔG0 values with an increase in temperature shows that palladium
adsorption does not proceed well at higher temperatures. The negative
ΔH0 (−103.63 kJ mol–1) points the exothermic adsorption behavior, and also its magnitude
gives vital information on the adsorption type, which could be either
physical or chemical. When there is physical adsorption, ΔH0 would generally be less than 80 kJ mol–1, and for chemical adsorption, ΔH0 has a range of 80–400 kJ mol–1.45 The negative ΔS0 (−319.67 J mol–1 K–1) is indicative of decreased randomness at the Pd(II)-PEI-AO interface.
The negative activation energy (Ea) at
different temperatures (Ea = ΔHads0 + RT) is also an indicator of the exothermic nature
of adsorption of Pd(II) onto the PEI-AO adsorbent surface.14

For the recovery of adsorbed palladium, the fixed bed column studies
were performed on a glass column packed with 1.0 g of the PEI-AO adsorbent.
A 10 mg L–1 Pd(II) was poured onto the adsorbent
column (flow rate 5 mL min–1), and the concentration
of palladium in the solution phase was measured using atomic absorption
spectroscopy (AAS). Thiourea that contains sulfur and nitrogen as
coordinating atoms was used as a desorbing agent. Desorption of palladium
was found to be effective with a 9 mL volume of 0.2 mol L–1 aqueous thiourea. This could be elucidated through the formation
of palladium–thiourea yellow colored complex, which considerably
lowers the interaction between the adsorbent (PEI-AO) and Pd(II) ions,
thereby facilitating palladium desorption from the adsorbent surface.
After 3 cycles of regeneration, the percentage adsorption of palladium
was slightly decreased from 91.4 to 90.8%, whereas the 4th cycle showed
the percentage adsorption as 84.6%. This shows that the adsorbent
could be regenerated and reused for three cycles using thiourea without
any significant loss in adsorption capability. This has additionally
proven the robustness and stability of the PEI surface functionalization.

The interaction between Pd(II) and PEI was probed using IR spectroscopy
(Figure 6). The IR
spectrum of PEI shows characteristic peaks at 3359 cm–1 (−N–H stretching), 2947, 2849 cm–1 (−C–H stretching), 1570 cm–1 (−N–H
bending), 1476 cm–1 (−C–H bending),
and 1312, 1116 cm–1 (−C–N stretching).46−48 After loading Pd(II) onto PEI, the N–H bending peak at 1570
cm–1 and the −C–N stretching at 1312
cm–1 were vastly suppressed, whereas new peaks were
prominent at 1631, 1514, and 1466 cm–1. This shows
that the electrostatic interaction through the N–H group is
certainly accountable for palladium sorption. In the case of PEI-AO,
the N–H stretching peak at 1567 cm–1 was
suppressed after palladium sorption, confirming the role of nitrogen
in the adsorption of palladium (Figure S4).

Figure 6 FT-IR spectra of neat PEI before and after adsorption of Pd(II).

The Pd-PEI-AO and rPd-PEI-AO were
characterized using XPS to gain
additional insight into the interaction between palladium and the
adsorbent (Figure 7). In both the cases, the survey scan revealed the presence of N
1s and Pd 3d peaks. The N 1s narrow scan revealed that the nitrogen
peak of PEI-AO at 399.1 eV was shifted to 399.8 eV after Pd adsorption,
indicating that the electron density surrounding the nitrogen was
decreased because of the interaction with Pd(II).48 After reduction of palladium, the N 1s peak at 399.5 eV
was appeared to be broader and less in intensity, which indicates
that the palladium linked to the nitrogen is reduced; as a consequence,
the nitrogen has partially regained its electron density. The Pd 3d
narrow scan revealed that the Pd-PEI-AO exhibited the characteristic
Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 peaks at 335.5 and 340.7
eV, respectively. The deconvolution of the curve reveals that the
palladium mostly exists in its +2 oxidation state when adsorbed over
PEI-AO. After reduction, the peaks have become much sharper and shifted
to a lower binding energy value, which substantiated that the Pd present
in rPd-PEI-AO was successfully reduced to zero-valent oxidation state.49

scan

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded for pristine
AO,
Pd-PEI-AO, and rPd-PEI-AO and presented in Figure 8. The pristine AO exhibited broad peaks,
indicating the amorphous nature of alumina possessing a certain amount
of nanocrystalline domains. The XRD pattern of Pd-PEI-AO was found
to be almost identical to the pristine AO (JCPDS # 77-0396) except
for the peak at 39.9° corresponding to the (111) plane of palladium
(JCPDS # 89-4897). After reduction, the intensity of the (111) plane
of palladium in rPd-PEI-AO was increased, whereas that of the planes
that correspond to AO were relatively suppressed. This could be attributed
to the increased crystallinity of palladium, facilitated by the reduction
process.

Figure 8 XRD patterns of pristine AO, Pd-PEI-AO, and rPd-PEI-AO (* and #
indicate the planes corresponding to alumina and palladium, respectively).

Field-emission scanning electron
microscopy (FE-SEM) imaging and
energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses for PEI-AO, Pd-PEI-AO,
and rPd-PEI-AO were performed, and the results are shown in Figure 9. In all the samples,
the surface morphology of the AO was found to be almost identical.
The samples were vastly found to possess flat platelike particles,
which were comprised of nanogranules. The EDS analysis of PEI-AO revealed
the presence of elements such as C, O, and Al. It is known that nitrogen
is less sensitive and susceptible for interference in EDS and is therefore
excluded. In the case of Pd-PEI-AO, in addition to C, O, and Al, about
0.8 at % of Pd and 1.3 at % of Cl were also detected. This could be
attributed to the PdCl42– adsorbed over
the Pd-PEI-AO. After reduction of palladium, the rPd-PEI-AO showed
an increased amount of Pd (∼1.1 at %), whereas the Cl was completely
absent. The loss of chlorine has additionally confirmed that the PdCl42– was successfully reduced to metallic
palladium.

One of the popular catalytic
performance evaluations of a noble
metal catalyst is the conversion of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol
(4-AP).50 This conversion has a practical
significance that an endocrine disruptor (4-NP) chemical is converted
to its corresponding amino derivative. In this case, the product 4-AP
is a precursor for the synthesis of paracetamol,
thus signifying the valorization of a potential hazardous chemical.
The conversion of 4-NP to 4-AP was followed using UV–visible
(UV–vis) spectroscopy. The original yellow color of 4-NP was
intensified to dark yellow upon addition of NaBH4 because
of the formation of the phenolate ion, which exhibited an absorption
maximum at 400.5 nm. When the catalyst was added, the color of the
solution faded and became colorless on complete reduction of 4-NP.
This was witnessed by the gradual decrease in the absorption band
at 400.5 nm and formation of a new band at 307 nm, corresponding to
the 4-AP. The representative UV–vis spectra and the recyclability
data are shown in Figure 10. In the first cycle, 98% reduction of 4-NP was achieved in
3 min, whereas the fifth cycle required 11 min to accomplish the same.
The gradual decrease in the activity could be due to the loss of small
amounts of palladium during each cycle and/or catalyst poisoning.
Therefore, we quantified the total palladium content leached into
the solution phase over three cycles using AAS, and it was found that
less than 1% of palladium got leached into the solution phase, whereas
that desorbed using thiourea from the spent catalyst was found to
be ∼96%. The rate of 4-NP reduction at 10% conversion in the
first cycle was found to be 125 mmol L–1 min–1 g–1.

A representative inorganic polluting species is Cr(VI), which
is
considered to be potentially carcinogenic, whereas Cr(III) is known
to be an essential metabolite for the function of insulin.51 Hence, it is essential to convert Cr(VI) to
less toxic Cr(III) through a simple and facile process. The catalytic
reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) was chosen as a model system to explore
the potential of Pd-PEI-AO toward environmental remediation. In an
attempt toward Cr(VI) reduction, no significant reaction occurred
when the Pd-PEI-AO was directly used as the catalyst. This is because
the catalytic property of Pd(II) toward Cr(VI) reduction under the
experimental conditions was poor. Therefore, the Pd-PEI-AO was subjected
to reduction to yield rPd-PEI-AO, which was further used for Cr(VI)
reduction. Oxalic acid was used as a sacrificial agent in this case.
The reduction of Cr(VI) was followed using UV spectrometry at a wavelength
maximum of 350 nm. About 95% reduction was attained within 3 min in
the first cycle, whereas the fifth cycle required 7 min to accomplish
the same (Figure 11). This has revealed that the catalyst possessed adequate activity
even after multiple times of regeneration. The rate of Cr(VI) reduction
at 10% conversion in the first cycle was found to be 67 mmol L–1 min–1 g–1. The
palladium leaching studies revealed that ∼7% of the metal was
leached into the solution phase over three cycles of the reaction
and ∼88% of palladium was desorbed using thiourea solution.
The little excess of palladium leaching as compared to the 4-NP reduction
could be due to the oxalic acid used in the catalytic reaction, which
could have interacted with the basic amine groups in PEI and caused
liberation of small quantities of the bound metal.

Sustainable hydrogen production is considered to be one of
the
important avenues to meet the growing energy demand. Among the various
hydrogen sources, ammonia borane (AB) is considered to be one of the
safest and green compounds that possess high density of hydrogen.52 On-demand catalytic hydrogen generation is therefore
considered to be an important reaction. The Pd-PEI-AO was tested for
its catalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution from AB in aqueous
medium. The first cycle produced the maximum amount (∼52 mL)
of hydrogen in about 2 min, whereas the successive cycles up to five
times required 3 to 4 min of duration to produce similar quantity
of hydrogen (Figure 12). This has additionally proven the high catalytic performance of
Pd-PEI-AO even after multiple cycles with a minimal to moderate loss
in activity. The rate of hydrogen production at 10% conversion in
the first cycle was found to be 10.5 mol min–1 g–1. The stability of the adsorbed palladium over three
cycles was studied through the estimation of the palladium content
in the solution phase and solid phase before and after the reaction.
AAS studies revealed that the total palladium content leached into
the solution phase over three cycles was less than 1%, whereas that
desorbed using thiourea from the spent catalyst was found to be ∼96%.

generation studies from AB up to five cycles using Pd-PEI-AO.

Conclusions
Facile surface functionalization
of PEI over AO was accomplished
in a two-step approach, which was confirmed using IR, XPS, TGA, and
zeta potential measurements. The present work showed the utility of
the PEI-coated AO toward effective adsorption of palladium. The sorption
parameters of palladium were studied through pH effect, contact time,
amount of adsorbent, concentrations, and temperature. The optimum
pH for the adsorption of Pd(II) was found to be 6.0, and the adsorption
adhered to the pseudo-second-order kinetics. Although the native alumina
showed an adsorption capacity of 35.08 mg g–1, the
PEI-AO exhibited a high adsorption capacity of 97.7 mg g–1, obtained through the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The exothermic
nature of the adsorption process and the negative free energy obtained
at various temperatures confirm the spontaneity of adsorption. XPS
analyses of Pd-PEI-AO and rPd-PEI-AO revealed the favorable interaction
of PdCl42– with nitrogen moieties of
PEI. XRD studies on these samples revealed an increase in the crystallinity
of palladium after reduction. The catalytic reduction of 4-NP and
Cr(VI) using Pd-PEI-AO was found to proceed with rates as high as
125 and 67 mmol L–1 min–1 g–1, respectively. Hydrogen generation from AB was found
to be efficient with Pd-PEI-AO with a rate of 10.5 mol min–1 g–1 at 10% conversion. Recyclability of Pd-PEI-AO
was studied up to five cycles in all the three catalytic reactions,
which revealed the potential of the sorbent for efficient reusability.
The amine functionalization strategy presented in this work could
also show potential in recovering and reusing other precious metals
such as gold, platinum, and rhodium.28

Experimental
Section
Materials
AO of ∼80 nm in average size was procured
from Nanoshel Inc. and used as received. SC, acetic acid, PEI (branched, Mw ≈ 800), EDC, and NHS were procured
from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium borohydride, 4-NP, potassium dichromate,
sodium hydroxide, sulfuric acid, and oxalic acid were purchased from
SD Fine Chemicals, India Ltd. Palladium chloride was procured from
HiMedia, India. The procured chemicals were used as received, unless
otherwise mentioned. AB was synthesized following the literature procedure.53

Characterization
A Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR)
spectrophotometer (JASCO FTIR-4200) was utilized to study the functionalization
of alumina nanosupport and palladium adsorption. TGA was carried out
using a Shimadzu DTG-60 differential thermal analyzer to follow the
degradation profile of the surface-immobilized organics. XPS measurements
were performed in a PHI 5000 Versa Prob II (FEI Inc.) instrument to
study the surface chemical composition. A Zetasizer Nano-ZS instrument
(Malvern) was employed to measure the particle size as well as the
surface zeta potential, wherein the test samples were taken in the
form of 20 μg/mL aqueous suspensions of the materials. The surface
area analysis of the materials was examined using a BET (Smart Sorb
93) apparatus using the nitrogen adsorption/desorption method. The
surface morphology and the elemental composition of the functionalized
nanosupport were determined by FE-SEM fitted with EDS (Carl Zeiss
ULTRA-55). The XRD pattern of the samples was measured using a Rigaku
Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418
Å) at a scan rate of 1°/min. The palladium concentration
in the aqueous phase was analyzed using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry
(Shimadzu AA 7000) at 247.6 nm with an acetylene–air flame
combination.

Carboxyl Functionalization of AO
In a typical reaction,
1.0 g of AO was added to 100 mL of Millipore water in a 250 mL round
bottom flask. To this, about 20 wt % (w.r.t. AO) SC was added, and
the mixture was sonicated for 30 min in an ultrasonication bath to
disperse the particles in the media. The temperature of the reaction
medium was increased to 90 °C in an oil bath and allowed to stand
for 8 h under stirring.54 Subsequently,
the mixture was cooled to room temperature and centrifuged. The resultant
product (SC-AO) was acidified by adding 50% (v/v) aqueous acetic acid
solution and incubated for 10 min. The CA-AO thus obtained was centrifuged,
washed with Millipore water three times, and then dried in a vacuum
oven for overnight at room temperature.

PEI Functionalization of
CA-AO
The amine functionalization
was carried out by covalently anchoring PEI onto CA-AO through amide
coupling.55 To achieve this, about 1.0
g of CA-AO in 20 mL of water was treated with a solution containing
0.6 g of EDC and 0.2 g of NHS. The resulting suspension was stirred
for 3 h at room temperature. After this time, the suspension was added
dropwise into a beaker containing 1.2 g of PEI dissolved in 500 mL
of water and the pH of the mixture was adjusted to 5 and stirred for
24 h at room temperature. Finally, the PEI-AO was obtained by centrifugation,
washing, and drying in a manner similar to CA-AO.

Batch Adsorption
Experiments
The batch adsorption studies
were carried out by taking 0.1 g of adsorbent (PEI-AO) in 30 mL of
10 mg L–1 Pd(II) solution prepared in HCl medium,
and the parameters such as pH, adsorbent amount, adsorption time,
and temperature were optimized at room temperature (25 °C) for
the desired time interval in an orbital incubator shaker at 120 rpm.
The optimized pH was 6.0. Various initial concentrations of Pd(II)
ranging from 40 to 300 mg L–1 were used to study
the isotherms. The adsorbed palladium(II) at equilibrium (qe) is calculated using the following relation 7  where C0 and Ce are the initial and final liquid-phase
concentrations
of palladium, respectively, V is the volume (in L)
of the solution, and W is the weight (in g) of the
PEI-AO adsorbent used. The adsorption process was studied using first-order
and second-order kinetics, and the isotherms were evaluated using
Langmuir and Freundlich models.

Characterization and Catalysis
Studies of Pd-Adsorbed PEI-AO
For the characterization studies,
300 mg L–1 palladium
chloride solution was stirred with 0.1 g of PEI-AO to ensure maximum
palladium adsorption. The resultant material was coded as Pd-PEI-AO
and used for catalytic studies. The reduction of 4-NP was carried
out by taking the catalytic quantity (∼5 mg) of Pd-PEI-AO in
10 mL of solution containing 0.143 mM 4-NP and 14.3 mM NaBH4. The reaction progress was monitored using a UV–vis spectrophotometer.
After the complete reduction of 4-NP, the Pd-PEI-AO was recovered
through centrifugation and reconstituted for recyclability studies.
To perform Cr(VI) reduction, the Pd-PEI-AO was subjected to reduction
using NaBH4 solution to reduce the adsorbed palladium,
referred hereafter as rPd-PEI-AO. A stock solution of 20 mg L–1 potassium dichromate containing 0.33 M oxalic acid
was prepared, and the pH was adjusted to 3.0. To a 3 mL of this solution,
5 mg of the rPd-PEI-AO was added and the UV–vis absorbance
of the resultant solution was recorded as a function of time. After
the complete reduction of Cr(VI), the solution was centrifuged to
recover the catalyst, which was utilized for the recyclability studies.
For hydrogen generation experiments, 100 mg of rPd-PEI-AO was added
to a 20 mL 64.8 mM AB solution and stirred. The evolved hydrogen gas
was measured using the gas burette method. In all the catalytic reactions,
the reusability was studied up to five cycles.
