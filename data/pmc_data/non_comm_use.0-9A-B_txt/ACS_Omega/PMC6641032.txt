Developing eco-friendly and cost-effective
processes for the synthesis
of graphene oxide (GO) is essential for its widespread industrial
applications. In this work, we propose a green synthesis technique
for GO production using recycled sulfuric acid and filter-processed
oxidized natural graphite obtained from a Couette–Taylor flow
reactor. The viscosity of reactant mixtures processed from Couette–Taylor
flow was considerably lower (∼200 cP at 25 °C) than that
of those from Hummers’ method, which enabled the simple filtration
process. The filtered sulfuric acid can be recycled and reused for
the repetitive GO synthesis with negligible differences in the as-synthesized
GO qualities. This removal of sulfuric acid has great potential in
lowering the overall GO production cost as the amount of water required
during the fabrication process, which takes a great portion of the
total production cost, can be dramatically reduced after such acid
filtration. The proposed eco-friendly GO fabrication process is expected
to promote the commercial application of graphene materials into industry
shortly.

Introduction
Graphene is a free
standing, two-dimensional monolayer carbon-based
nanomaterial with remarkable physical properties, which has been studied
in various applications such as transistor, transparent electrode,
supercapacitor, sensor, and polymer composite.1−11 Typical synthesis routes of graphene include mechanical exfoliation
from bulk graphite (the “Scotch-tape” method),4 chemical vapor deposition (CVD) through the reaction
of metal catalysts and precursors,12−16 or chemical exfoliation of graphite using strong
oxidants.9,17−29 For practical industrial applications of graphene, the synthesis
routes should guarantee high-quality, low-cost, and high-yield eco-friendly
processes. The mechanical exfoliation method can yield the highest
quality of graphene, but the associated process is not suitable for
the mass production.4 Although large-area
as well as single-layered graphene sheets can be produced by the CVD
method, the fabrication process is rather complex and requires metal
catalysts, which can potentially raise the overall production costs.12−16 On the other hand, the solution-processed chemical exfoliation technique
is desirable for the large-scale production process with relatively
lower costs,9,17−29 and various functional composite structures can also be readily
constructed utilizing the oxygen-containing functional groups created
on the basal plane and edge sites of graphene.17,21

In chemical exfoliation processes, strong acids are typically
used,
and graphene oxide (GO) produced from Hummers’ method is one
of the most widely studied graphene derivatives synthesized by such
an approach. Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is frequently
used in the oxidation process of GO,30−32 which raises serious
environmental concerns and also increases the overall production cost
due to the large amount of water required to handle the discharged
acid waste and to purify the resulting GO from the acid. A few studies
suggested adjusting the concentration and volume of the applied acid
to mitigate the aforementioned issues.31−33

Herein, we report
a facile filter system to recycle the H2SO4 and
reduce the amount of water required for the GO
production process, which can facilitate the reduction of overall
production cost and commercialization of GO-based materials with alleviated
environmental concerns. H2SO4 and graphite oxide
were separated through the filter system after the oxidation of graphite
using the Couette–Taylor reactor and before the washing process.
The Couette–Taylor flow reactor is equipped with rotating inner
and fixed outer coaxial cylinders. Toroidal vortices are generated
and evenly spaced along the axis at a critical rotating speed of the
inner cylinder.34−36 In our previous study, the toroidal flow of solutions
led to excellent blending of graphite with oxidants (KMnO4 and H2SO4), thus enhancing the oxidation efficiency
with high yields of single- and few-layered GO production.37 The Couette–Taylor flow reactor comprises
two coaxial cylinders. Whereas the outer cylinder remains standstill,
the inner one rotates at controlled speed. When the rotational speed
of the inner cylinder reaches a threshold value, doughnut-shaped vortexes
are generated, which rotate in opposite directions with constant arrays
along the cylinder axis. This Couette–Taylor vortex induces
highly effective radial mixing and uniform fluidic motion within each
vortex cell, enabling enhanced mass transfer of the reactants. The
toroidal motion also generates high wall shear stress, which can facilitate
GO fabrication.34−37 The key parameter that renders the acid filtration process possible
is the viscosity of the reactant mixtures, which shows distinctive
characteristics between the Hummers and Couette–Taylor methods
as discussed later. The filtered acid can also be recycled in subsequent
GO production processes, and such consecutive oxidation reactions
from the Couette–Taylor flow reactor were successfully demonstrated
utilizing the recycled H2SO4.

Results and Discussion
The modified Hummers method has been widely adopted as the standardized
synthesis technique for GO production because of its relatively simple
approach.30−32 However, the long reaction time and use of large
volume of water in Hummers’ method have been the major bottleneck
to its widespread industrial applications. In our previous work, we
demonstrated that the Couette–Taylor flow reactor can dramatically
reduce the process time with high yield of single- and few-layered
GOs (Figure 1a).37 In a typical GO synthesis process, the dissolved
oxidizing agent (KMnO4) in acid (H2SO4) is diffused into the graphite interlayer during the oxidation reaction
of graphite, which leads to increase in the viscosity of the mixture
(graphite, KMnO4, and H2SO4).32 As shown in Figure 1b, the viscosity of the mixture before the
oxidation reaction is ∼50 cP at 25 °C, which increases
to ∼85 and ∼200 cP for the Hummers and Couette–Taylor
flow methods, respectively, after the oxidation reaction of 60 min.
For this reaction time, the recovery rate of GO prepared by Couette–Taylor
flow is ∼98%, indicating that the graphite oxides are mostly
well-oxidized and exfoliated into single- and few-layered GOs, whereas
the recovery rate is only ∼34% for Hummers’ method,
implying inefficient oxidation and exfoliation. Although the recovery
rate of Hummers’ method (∼93%) becomes comparable to
that of Couette–Taylor flow after prolonged treatment time
(1440 min), the viscosity of the mixture is extremely increasing (10 000
cP), which impedes the acid filtration. Therefore, the Couette–Taylor
flow method enables the acid filtration process by producing the reactant
mixtures with relatively low viscosity (<200 cP) and can achieve
the high recovery rate at the same time, whereas in Hummers’
method, these two important conditions cannot be realized simultaneously.
We note that the graphite oxide mixture prepared from Hummers’
method for 60 min of reaction time can be used in the filtering process
with its low viscosity (∼85 cP). However, the low recovery
rate of the resulting GO (∼34%) is limiting the efficacy of
Hummers’ method in the filtration process. On the basis of
these results, for the filtering process of H2SO4, the oxidation reaction of 60 min by the Couette–Taylor flow
method was used for the following sets of analysis.

and Couette–Taylor flow methods.

H2SO4 filtration in the graphite mixture
was conducted before washing with water during the GO production process
using the Couette–Taylor flow reactor. Figure 2a illustrates the schematic diagram of the
suggested acid filtering process, in which the viscosity of the reactants
affects the filtration efficiency. Because of the low viscosity of
the reactant mixture manufactured from the Couette–Taylor flow
reactor, the oxidized graphite slurries were successfully separated
into H2SO4 and graphite oxide, as shown in Figure 2b. After filtering
the H2SO4, the remaining graphite oxide slurries
could then be washed with a significantly reduced amount of water
compared to that required in the existing Hummers method (decreased
by 75%). Furthermore, the filtered H2SO4 could
be recycled for the repetitive GO synthesis in the Couette–Taylor
flow reactor. In the following, various types of GO products, GO with
fresh H2SO4 (F-GO), one-time recycled H2SO4 (1R-GO), and two-time recycled H2SO4 (2R-GO), were comparatively analyzed.

Figure 3 shows

pictures of the natural graphite and three different types of GOs.
Thick-layered platelets are mostly observed in natural graphite (Figure 3a). On the contrary,
GO samples were well-exfoliated and exhibited a wrinkled thin sheet
form for both the fresh and recycled H2SO4 cases
(Figure 3b–d).
These results suggest that the recycled H2SO4 can also effectively oxidize the graphite as the fresh H2SO4.

and

The progression of oxidation reaction
in the Couette–Taylor
flow reactor was spectroscopically examined as shown in Figure 4. Figure 4a shows XRD patterns of F-GO, 1R-GO, and
2R-GO compared to those of natural graphite. The interlayer spacing
was originally ∼0.34 nm (2θ = ∼26.4°) for
the natural graphite, which widened to ∼0.75 nm (2θ =
∼10.6°) for the three GO flake cases, typical value for
highly oxidized graphite oxide, thus confirming the reliable oxidation
capability of the recycled H2SO4. Raman spectra
of GO flakes exhibited G peaks at ∼1590 cm–1 and D peaks at ∼1350 cm–1 in all cases
(Figure 4b), with broadened
G-band and increased D-band characteristics compared to those of the
graphite flake, indicating the existence of oxidized graphitic states. Figure 4c shows C1s X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of GO samples with typical
results in accordance with those
for oxygen functional groups on carbon: 284.5, 286.8, and 288.7 eV
related to sp2 carbon in aromatic rings, epoxy/hydroxyl
groups (C–O), and carbonyl groups (C=O), respectively.

characterizations of natural graphite and three types
of GOs (F-GO, 1R-GO, and 2R-GO). (a) XRD patterns, (b) Raman spectra
(514 nm laser excitation), and (c) C1s XPS spectra.

For the thickness characterization of the exfoliated
GO sheet,
GO flakes were coated on silicon substrates and then analyzed by via
AFM. GO sheets are typically thicker than the pure graphene because
of various functional groups, such as hydroxy, epoxide, and carboxy
groups, present on the basal planes and edges of the graphene. The
height profiles of F-GO, 1R-GO, and 2R-GO sheets reveal uniform flake
thicknesses of ∼0.8 nm, normal
of sufficiently oxidized GO sheet (Figure 5). These observations suggest that high-quality,
single- and few-layered GOs can be successfully produced using the
recycled H2SO4 during the synthesis process.

and thickness profiles of GO sheets. (a) F-GO, (b)
1R-GO, and (c) 2R-GO. The measured thickness of all three types of
GO sheets was ∼0.8 nm.

The efficacy of filtration process using recycled H2SO4 was further examined after separating the non- or
low-oxidized graphite flakes. The resulting recovery rates of the
three different types of GOs are presented in Figure 6. The recovery rates were ∼98.5, ∼97.1,
and ∼97.9% for F-GO, 1R-GO, and 2R-GO, respectively, indicating
that the graphite was successfully exfoliated into single- or few-layered
GO in all three cases. These results again support the fact that the
recycled H2SO4 can be used to fabricate GO as
the fresh H2SO4.

GO obtained using fresh and first- and second-recycled
H2SO4. Photograph: Dispersed GO solution after
sonication and centrifugation. Precipitates in the bottom of the conical
tube represent non- or low-oxidized graphitic particles.

The amount of water consumption during the GO synthesis,
which
accounts for the large portion of the production cost, needs to be
considered for practical industrial applications of GO. In the following,
we compared the amount of water spent during the washing process from
Hummers’ method and that from the proposed filter process (Table 1). In the case of
Hummers’ method, 1600 mL of water was required to reach pH
5 for 1 g of the graphite oxide mixture. After the first filtration
process, the volume of rinsing water used was dramatically reduced
to 400 mL for the same amount of mixture to reach pH 5 and similarly
for the one- and two-recycled cases. Therefore, the suggested filter
system in conjunction with the Couette–Taylor flow reactor
can selectively filter H2SO4 from graphite oxide
mixtures, which can significantly reduce the amount of water required
during the purification process, a critical requirement for the commercialization
of the solution-based graphene synthesis approach.

Conclusions
In this study, we introduced a feasible filtering system for recycling
sulfuric acid during the GO synthesis process by the Couette–Taylor
flow reactor. Successful filtration of the acid enabled dramatic reduction
of purifying water content required in the synthesis process. After
the filtration process, the impurities present in the graphite oxide
mixture were effectively rinsed and removed by only 25% of the purifying
water required in the conventional Hummers method. Moreover, the filtered
sulfuric acid could be reused for the repetitive GO synthesis processes,
contributing to save the overall fabrication cost. By adopting the
filtration process, the single- and few-layered GOs have also been
successfully produced in high efficiency. In terms of mass commercial
production, our approach for eco-friendly fabrication of GO demonstrates
obvious advantages over the existing technique and may find its usefulness
in diverse industrial applications.

Experimental Section
Materials
Graphite flakes (150 μm) were obtained
from Alfa Aesar. Potassium permanganate (KMnO4), sulfuric
acid (H2SO4, 95%), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Membrane
filter (25 μm of pore size) was obtained from CS Technofil Co.,
Ltd. (South Korea).

Synthesis of GO Using Fresh and Recycled
H2SO4
GO was synthesized from natural
graphite using the
Couette–Taylor flow reactor (Figure S1). Graphite flakes (7 g) were added to 250 mL of H2SO4, and then, 35 g of KMnO4 was slowly added while
stirring for 30 min at ∼10 °C. This mixture was loaded
into the Couette–Taylor flow reactor for oxidation reaction
and intercalation. The 500 mm long reactor consists of two coaxial
cylinders: a 120 mm diameter rotating inner cylinder and a 130 mm
diameter fixed outer cylinder. When the mixture is injected into the
space between the two cylinders, the inner cylinder is rotated. In
this work, the rotating speed was 1000 rpm with the reaction time
of 60 min. Oxidation of graphite resulted in brown-colored pasty slurry.
The color change of mixture from greenish black to brown indicates
that the oxidation and intercalation are fully occurred. The obtained
slurry was filtrated through a 25 μm pore size poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
(polypropylene) membrane to extract the H2SO4. During the filter process, 171, 167, and 159 mL of H2SO4 came out in each cycle. It means 79, 83, and 91 mL
of H2SO4 was lost in first (using fresh sulfuric
acid), second (using first-recycled sulfuric acid), and third (using
second-recycled sulfuric acid) cycles, respectively. Then, 250 mL
of ultrapure water and 15 mL of H2O2 were poured
into the filtered slurry, and the mixture was stirred for 30 min.
Centrifuge was used to purify the filtered graphite oxide from the
impurities, which was then
freeze-dried for characterization and mass measurement. The filtered
H2SO4 was reused for the repetitive GO synthesis
following similar processes as described above. After drying, the
graphite oxide was dispersed in water followed by sonication. After
sonication, non- or low-oxidized graphite was precipitated by centrifugation
at 4000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant containing single- and few-layered
GOs was freeze-dried for characterization and mass measurement of
the GO. The efficiency of the recycling process was evaluated by the
characterization of the produced GOs and a recovery rate defined by
the mass ratio between the single- or few-layered GO and the initial
graphite oxide.

Characterization
Microstructures
of the GO were investigated
by field emission scanning electron microscopy (JSM-7600F, JEOL).
The thickness of GO sheets was determined via atomic force microscopy
(SPA-300HV, SII). To analyze the further characteristics of GO and
graphite oxide, X-ray diffraction (D8 ADVANCE, BRUKER), Raman (Bruker
FRA 160/S, BRUKER), and X-ray photoelectron (VG Microtech ESCA2000,
JEOL) spectroscopy were used.
