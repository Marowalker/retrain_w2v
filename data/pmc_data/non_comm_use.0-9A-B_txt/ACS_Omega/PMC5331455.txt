This
article describes the design of piezoresistive thin-film sensors
based on single-layer graphene decorated with metallic nanoislands.
The defining characteristic of these composite thin films is that
they can be engineered to exhibit a temperature coefficient of resistance
(TCR) that is close to zero. A mechanical sensor with this property
is stable against temperature fluctuations of the type encountered
during operations in the real world, for example, in a wearable sensor.
The metallic nanoislands are grown on graphene through thermal deposition
of metals (gold or palladium) at a low nominal thickness. Metallic
films exhibit an increase in resistance with temperature (positive
TCR), whereas graphene exhibits a decrease in resistance with temperature
(negative TCR). By varying the amount of deposition, the morphology
of the nanoislands can be tuned such that the TCRs of a metal and
graphene cancel out. The quantitative analysis of scanning electron
microscope images reveals the importance of the surface coverage of
the metal (as opposed to the total mass of the metal deposited). The
stability of the sensor to temperature fluctuations that might be
encountered in the outdoors is demonstrated by subjecting a wearable
pulse sensor to simulated solar irradiation.

Introduction
Wearable and implantable
sensors can be designed to detect a range
of chemical, biophysical, electromagnetic, and thermal stimuli. However,
some types of sensors are responsive only to one type of stimulus.
For example, strain gauges based on metallic thin films are sensitive
not only to mechanical deformation but also to temperature. Unwanted
sensitivity to temperature could arise because of, for example, thermal
expansion of the substrate or the fact that the conductivity of a
metal depends on temperature (i.e., the temperature coefficient of
resistance, TCR). Our laboratory has previously shown that metallic
nanoislands on graphene are sensitive to a wide range of mechanical,
optical, chemical, and electrophysiological signals.1,2 During the course of these experiments, we noticed that thermal
drift—that is, small changes in the local ambient temperature—produced
changes in the electrical resistance of the sensors that were comparable
to or greater than those produced by the stimuli of interest. The
problem of convoluted signals is not unique to this type of sensor
but is rarely reported for experiments on other types of sensors,
which are performed in well-controlled environments.

Decoupling
the signal of interest from unwanted signals can be
addressed in one of at least two ways: (1) by processing the signals
using back-end electronics or (2) by designing the material used for
sensing. This paper uses the second approach—in which decoupling
of thermal drift is accomplished by the material itself. Because graphene
exhibits a TCR that is less than zero3 and
metals exhibit a TCR that is greater than zero,4 we fabricated composite thin films consisting of metallic
nanoislands supported by single-layer graphene (Figure 1). (Metallic nanoislands are the disconnected
structures that form with low nominal thicknesses when metals are
deposited through physical vapor deposition.) By tuning the amount
of metals deposited—and thus the interconnectivity and surface
coverage of the nanoislands—it was possible to engineer the
composite material such that the TCR of the two different materials
canceled out to near zero.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of the process used to generate
and transfer
metallic nanoislands on graphene. Nanoislands are formed by thermal
evaporation of metals onto copper-supported graphene. The backing
copper is etched using a basic ammonium persulfate solution. The film
can then be transferred to a substrate of interest and addressed for
electrical measurements.

Previous work on the topic of zero-TCR materials has been
primarily
concerned with bulk metal alloys and other materials that require
complex processing. Metal alloys include manganin and constantin;
the latter has been used for over a century in the components of thermocouples.
New alloys5−7 have been developed, along with tunable-TCR materials
such as metal–polymer composites,8−11 carbon mixtures,12 and semiconductor composites.13−15 Optical strain
sensors that are temperature-independent have also been reported.16 However, polymer and carbon mixtures involve
complex solution processing, and metal alloys reported so far have
been bulk materials, as opposed to thin films. For near-zero-TCR sensing
elements to be useful in flexible and wearable devices, it is desirable
to have active materials that are thin, transparent, and mechanically
robust.

A single layer of graphene behaves as a zero-gap semiconductor
with a negative TCR at room temperature. The resistivity is dominated
by the charge-carrier concentration and decreases with temperature
as more hot carriers become available.17 This phenomenon is in contrast to metals, which typically have a
positive TCR owing to an increase in both inelastic electron scattering
and lattice spacing with temperature.18 Given our previous experience with metal nanoislands on graphene
as a platform for multimodal sensing,2,19 we hypothesized
that a zero-TCR sensor could be fabricated if the right amount of
metal was deposited onto the graphene such that the effects of each
material cancel each other out. To design this material, we characterized
the effect of deposition thickness and island morphology on the TCR
of the graphene–metal composites. Gold and palladium were selected
as the metals to test this hypothesis because of their widespread
use in thermal and chemical thin-film sensing and disparate morphologies
formed when evaporated onto graphene.1,20

Results and Discussion
Thermoresistive
Behavior of Metal Nanoislands
The relationship
between electrical resistance, temperature, and thickness for metal
nanoislands on graphene is summarized in Figure 2a (gold) and 2b (palladium).
The reported thicknesses are the “nominal” values measured
using the quartz crystal microbalance in the evaporation chamber.
(The true thickness is poorly defined because of the disconnected
nature of the nanoisland films.) To find the TCR of these samples,
we measured the normalized resistance as a function of temperature
(from 30 to 65 °C); the TCR is the slope of this curve. As we
expected, the TCR of the composite films exhibited a strong dependence
on the nominal thickness of the metallic film. The scanning electron
microscope (SEM) images shown in Figure 2c–h suggest that the morphology—that
is, interconnectivity or fractional surface coverage—also influences
the sensitivity to temperature.

Figure 2 Thermoresistive behavior and morphology
of gold and palladium nanoislands.
The temperature-dependent normalized resistance is plotted for gold
nanoislands (a) and palladium nanoislands (b) of varied nominal thicknesses.
SEM micrographs depicting negative-TCR isolated nanoislands for 3
nm of gold (c) and 0.5 nm of palladium (d), near-zero TCR, partially
percolated structures for 8 nm of gold (e) and 0.9 nm of palladium
(f), and positive TCR, fully percolated structures for 11 nm of gold
(g) and 3.0 nm of palladium (h). All SEM images are under the same
magnification.

The SEM images in Figure 2c,d show distinct
differences between the morphologies of
the negative-TCR composites of gold and palladium, respectively. At
a nominal thickness of 4 nm, the gold assembles into large separated
islands with sharp crystalline facets. Palladium nanoislands, in contrast,
are smaller than gold nanoislands at all nominal thicknesses. Moreover,
they exhibit a higher fractional coverage at substantially lower nominal
thicknesses (0.5 nm). It also appears that the palladium nanoislands
may be interconnected.

The nominal thickness of deposition that
gave near-zero TCR was
8 nm for gold and 0.9 nm for palladium. The SEM image in Figure 2e shows that gold
forms partially percolated fractal structures that resulted from isolated
nanoislands coalescing in a disordered fashion during the growth process.
On the other hand, the palladium nanoislands did not coalesce but
did appear to be in intimate physical contact (Figure 2f). We attribute the differences in morphology
to the differences in relative interaction energies between the surface
and the metal nanoislands: palladium has a stronger attraction to
the surface and a closer epitaxial registry (a smaller lattice constant).21 Therefore, the palladium nanoislands are less
mobile than the gold nanoislands during the growth process.1 The SEM images in Figure 2g,h show that gold and palladium form completely
percolated nanostructures with a nominal thickness greater than 11
and 3 nm, respectively. Percolated structures in both materials yielded
a positive TCR—evidence that the thermoresistive behavior approaches
that of a thin film of metal.

In general, these results show
that the TCR can be controlled as
a function of nominal thickness of deposition. In cases when it is
necessary to eliminate thermal drift, a substrate with a near-zero
TCR can be repeatedly fabricated using either palladium or gold by
targeting a specific thickness. Moreover, this procedure should be
straightforward to transfer to any other transition metal of interest
for a specific device application. Interestingly, we found a large
difference in the nominal thickness that produced a near-zero TCR
of palladium (0.9 nm) versus that of gold (8 nm). Although morphologies
can be reproduced by holding the deposition parameters constant (chamber
pressure, evaporation rate, substrate, and nominal thickness),22 the nominal thickness is not a true indication
of the thickness of individual nanoislands. Thus, we found it necessary
to correlate the TCR with other morphological parameters to give a
more sophisticated description of the relationship between the TCR
and the morphology of the metal nanoislands.

Image Analysis and Modeling
of the Thermoresistive Behavior
of Metal Nanoislands
Image analysis was performed on the
SEM micrographs of gold nanoislands to quantitatively analyze the
trends between morphology and thermoresistive behavior. A thresholding
algorithm known as Otsu’s method23 was used to differentiate the metal structures from graphene. The
algorithm operates on the grayscale image by assuming two classes
of pixels, which fall above or below a threshold value (metal vs graphene).
The optimum threshold value is defined as the one that minimizes the
variance within each class of pixels. Once differentiated, distinct
islands are labeled and various properties are computed including
surface coverage and projected area. From Figure 3a, we can see that TCR varies linearly with
coverage. Examples of processed images are given in Figure 3b–d, where the separate
islands are colored by their area.

Figure 3 Morphological dependence of the TCR of
gold nanoislands obtained
through image analysis. (a) Plot showing linear dependence of TCR
on fractional coverage. Representative processed images for (b) negative
TCR (4 nm), (c) near-zero TCR (8 nm), and (d) positive TCR (11 nm)
gold nanoislands. Islands are colored by the projected area (nm2). The film in (d) is entirely white because it is a single
interconnected structure of area 225k nm2.

Given the observed dependence of TCR with coverage,
we developed
a model to describe the thermoresistive behavior of this composite
material. Adomov et al.24 have demonstrated
that the TCR of vacuum-deposited gold films depends on thickness, d, and can be described as  where αAu is the TCR of gold
and l is the electron mean free path (400 Å).
The actual island thickness can be related to the nominal thickness
using the coverage, θ, and the following relation  Finally, the TCR of the gold islands
can be
combined with the TCR of the supporting graphene (αGr) using a composite theory, with coverage as the fractional variable  

The results of our model are compared with the experimental data
in Figure 3a and demonstrate
good agreement. Additional details on the composite model are available
in the Supporting Information.

The
results of our model suggested that the lateral distribution
of the metal was more important than the total mass deposited. To
test this idea, we subjected an 11 nm gold nanoisland sample to rapid
thermal annealing (RTA), a method that has commonly been used to change
the morphology of metallic films on the nanoscale.25,26 The sample was heated from room temperature to 600 °C in 12
s and held at the elevated temperature for 5 min. This thermal treatment
changed the morphology of the metal from a percolated network to a
distribution of isolated nanoparticles (Figure S3). The TCR of the sample changed concomitantly from positive
to negative (Figure S4). This experiment
unambiguously demonstrated the importance of interconnectivity and
surface coverage of the metal islands on the TCR of the composite
material.

Wearable Application of Sensors with Near-Zero TCR
To demonstrate the utility of thin films resistant to thermal drift,
we fabricated a wearable sensor for detecting the human pulse using
gold nanoislands. Nanoisland-graphene films with positive, negative,
and near-zero TCRs were transferred onto Kapton tape, addressed with
carbon paint, and then adhered onto the wrist, as depicted in Figure 4a. A schematic diagram
of the sensor is shown in Figure S7. To
simulate a plausible real-world scenario where an abrupt heating event
would occur, we placed the sensor (on the wrist) over a solar simulator
lamp to imitate the direct illumination of a sensor by the sun. As
indicated by the gray-shaded area in Figure 4b, the gold nanoislands with the near-zero
TCR exhibited a minimal thermal drift. On the other hand, the positive-
and negative-TCR sensors experienced a substantial drift owing to
heating caused by direct illumination. When placed on the wrist, periodic
strain caused by the contractions of the radial artery induced a periodic
change in resistivity. This pulse signal was detected by the sensor
(inset Figure 4b).
To address whether the sensitivity of the wearable sensor was affected
by changing the nominal thickness of the metal to attain a near-zero
TCR, we examined the data closely in Figure 4b. Assuming that the strain caused by a pulse
was constant (because the same subject was used for all measurements
in Figure 4b), the
pulse signal was most pronounced in the near-zero-TCR sensor, indicating
that the sensor performance was not diminished by changing the nominal
thickness of metals. We then tested for any possible interference
from temperature-dependent conductivity of the carbon paint itself.
We attached copper wires to a gold film (50 nm) using a drop of carbon
paint with similar dimensions to those used in the wearable sensors.
Continuous measurement of resistance as a function of temperature
from ambient temperature to 60 °C revealed a net increase in
resistance of <1%. Given this small effect and the fact that the
samples were all connected using the same materials, we can confirm
that the observed differences in TCR between the graphene-nanoisland
films were due to the coverage and interconnectivity of the nanoislands.

black dashed lines. (b) Normalized resistance is plotted versus time
with a period of illumination by a solar simulator lamp, which is
marked by the gray-shaded area. The lamp heated the sensor to a steady-state
temperature of approximately 45 °C after 30 s as measured using
an infrared thermometer. The inset shows a clear pulse, with dicrotic
notches clearly visible.

Conclusions
We reported a new strategy to suppress
thermal drift in sensors.
This strategy is based on the precise control of materials in sensors
composed of graphene decorated with metal nanoislands. By systematically
varying the nominal thickness of the metal deposited, we found optimal
deposition parameters to produce composite thin films with near-zero
TCR for both gold and palladium on graphene. Differences in the self-assembly
process of gold nanoislands suggested that surface coverage and interconnectivity
were the most important morphological parameters in determining the
TCR of the composite material. Image analysis of SEM images provided
quantitative evidence to support this conclusion and enabled the development
of a model to describe the
thermoresistive behavior of the composite material. Proof-of-concept
wearable sensors were fabricated to demonstrate the stability of the
electrical signal to variations in surface temperature produced by
sunlight. This material-design strategy should be easily generalizable
to other transition metals for device-specific applications (e.g.,
chemical sensing) and provides a robust platform for the development
of devices that minimize fluctuations due to temperature. More generally,
these experiments demonstrate how well-known materials can be combined
in new ways to design thin-film composites with useful properties
for device applications.

Experimental Section
Metal Nanoisland Sensor
Fabrication
Metal nanoislands
were fabricated by physical vapor deposition using an AJA International
thermal evaporator (Orion-class). A thin film of palladium or gold
was deposited onto graphene supported on copper foil at a rate of
0.05 Å/s. Chamber pressure during deposition was 2.0 × 10–7 Torr. The resultant structure comprised nanoislands
on graphene on copper foil (nanoisland/Gr/Cu). Poly(methylmethacrylate)
(PMMA) (1 kDa, 200 nm) was spin-coated (1 wt % solution in anisole
at 4k rpm for 60 s) onto the nanoisland side of the nanoisland/Gr/Cu
sample. The backing copper foil was etched by floating the sample
copper-side-down in an aqueous ammonium persulfate solution (50 mg/mL)
for approximately 3 h. The samples were then transferred onto a 1
in. × 3 in. glass slide. The PMMA layer was then dissolved using
neat acetone at 40 °C.

SEM
An FEI XL30 SFEG instrument
with an FEI Sirion
column and Through-Lens Detector was used for SEM micrographs of metal
nanoislands. An accelerating voltage of 10 kV and a spot of 50 μm
were used for imaging.

TCR Measurements
Resistance measurements
were recorded
using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter. All resistance measurements for
wearable applications and TCR calculations were conducted using two-point
measurements. To decouple the possible effects of the contact resistance
of the carbon paint from the intrinsic resistance of the graphene-nanoisland
films, we compared the resistances obtained using two-point measurements
to those obtained using four-point measurements. The fact that the
resistance values differed by less than 1% suggested that the contact
resistance due to the carbon paint was negligible. All samples had
the same dimensions. The samples for TCR measurements were heated
using an Instec FS1 heating stage with an Instec mK2000 temperature
controller and electrically addressed with eutectic gallium–indium
(EGaIn).

Image Analysis
An object-oriented Python code was developed
to perform image analysis of the SEM images. This code made extensive
use of the Mahotas package (see Supporting Information) to distinguish the metal from graphene, identify separate nanoislands,
and quantify the area of the individual nanoislands as well as their
fractional coverage over the graphene. The code can be easily adapted
for the analysis of similar nanostructures and is openly available
at github.

RTA
RTA was performed using an AG
Associates Heatpulse
610. The samples were heated from room temperature to 600 °C
in 12 s (50 °C/s) under forming gas (5% hydrogen/95% nitrogen)
to aid reflow of the metal. The sample was held at the elevated temperature
for 5 min.
