A simple and sensitive liquid chromatography
method of analysis
has been developed and validated for the simultaneous quantitative
determination of food colors in a broad range of foods. The method
of analysis applies specific extraction solutions to obtain optimal
color extraction. The extraction solutions are composed of different
proportions of methanol and ammonium acetate, as the ion-pairing agent.
Analysis was performed on reverse-phase C18 Poroshell column with
ammonium acetate, methanol, acetonitrile, and acetone gradient elution
as the mobile phases. Multiple-specific wavelengths were used to monitor
color additives in the visible range to provide higher sensitivity
and expanded scope needed for a large number of analytes. All 27 color
compounds showed good linearity with regression coefficients predominantly
above 0.990. The limit of detection and limit of quantitation values
ranged from 0.10 to 0.43 and from 0.34 to 1.45 μg/g, respectively.
The precision of the method ranged from 1.4 to 15.9%, while recoveries
averaged 72% across all food commodities tested. The method of analysis
offers convenience and adequate sensitivity for the analysis of a
wide variety of food matrices containing a broad range of colors.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Organic aromatic synthetic
dyes are additives that are extensively
incorporated into foodstuffs for many purposes. They are often used
to enhance sensory perception, to compensate for color loss during
manufacturing or storage, as well as to preserve the uniform appearance
of food.1 For several years, concern has
arisen over the extensive use of synthetic coloring additives in foods.
To protect public health and to prevent the indiscriminate use, food
colors are comprehensively screened for safety. Many governing bodies
have set tight regulations limiting the allowable kinds, concentrations,
and purity of dyes.2−4 As a result, the need to monitor permitted and prohibited
food colors has increased, particularly in international food trade.
Therefore, it is necessary to rely on sensitive and accurate methods
to screen, identify, and quantitate color additives in foodstuffs.
Analysis of food dyes in foodstuffs by liquid chromatography (LC)
with ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) or MS/MS detection
using traditional C18 chromatographic columns has been reported in
several publications.17−26,38 However, few reported analytical
methods applied for a wide range of colors, including those permitted
in foodstuffs as well as banned dyes for food use.2−4

A broad
range of methods have been reported for the determination
of dyes in foods. Chromatographic methods of analysis such as paper
chromatography,5,6 thin-layer chromatography,7,8 gas chromatography (GC), as well as capillary electrophoresis (CE)9−11 were widely used but are now considered outdated methodologies.
GC methods have restricted applications to synthetic colors, typically
because of the lack of volatility and their limited stability at high
temperature.12 CE methods have also been
used for synthetic dyes but have limited use in routine analyses.13−15 Over the past years, LC has been shown to provide much more potential
for the analysis of synthetic food colors in terms of qualitative
and quantitative determinations, as well as speed of analysis.16 Most of the LC analyses used ion exchange with
gradient elution and were conducted to determine the purity of dyes,
thus clearly illustrating the power of LC in the field of color analyses.17−30,38 LC analysis with a UV–vis
or diode-array detector (DAD) is the most commonly used detection
because food colors absorb strongly at the UV and/or vis wavelengths.
Moreover, LC using reverse phase with ion pairing is currently the
most-preferred technique because it offers among others, the best
overall resolution and sensitivity.17−26 Ion-pairing chromatography consists of salt modifiers added to the
mobile phase. Suitable salts are selected as to create large ions
of opposite charges to the compounds to be analyzed, thus generating
reversible ion-pair complexes.18,22−26

Among all LC methods available for food colors, very few of
them
offer simultaneous quantitation and resolution of several permitted
food colors and nonpermitted dyes in a variety of food commodities.
Therefore, an optimized method was developed and validated to analyze
various foodstuffs where authorized food colors in Canada, in United
States of America (USA), and across the European Union (EU), as well
as some nonpermitted colors, are resolved and quantitated. In this
paper, we present the development, optimization, and validation of
a quantitative method of analysis for the determination of colors
in foodstuffs. The objectives were to (1) develop a reliable and robust
analytical method for the determination of 27 color compounds by keeping
detection and quantitation limit levels as low or below those already
reported in the literature for specific food dyes, (2) to optimize
the extraction step, (3) to optimize the chromatographic conditions
to reduce the cost and time of analysis, and (4) to expand the scope
of food color analysis to the applicability of a wide range of food
commodities in terms of the triangle of composition designed by the
Association of Official Analytical Communities (AOAC).

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Chemicals and Materials
The chemicals
and reagents used were all of analytical grade and LC grade. Methanol,
acetonitrile, and acetone were supplied from EMD (Billerica, MA, USA)
and glacial acetic acid by Fisher Scientific (Toronto, ON, Canada).
High-purity ammonium acetate and α-amylase from Aspergillus oryzae were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich

all LC analyses. When available, high-purity reference standards were
purchased from various sources. Table 1 lists the 27 chemical compounds used in this study.
Standards purity was confirmed by LC. When applicable, the subsidiary
dye content of the respective food colour was not taken into account.
Subsidiary dyes of erythrosine 4,5-diiodofluorescein, 2,4,5-triiodofluorescein
(erythrosin yellowish), and 2,4,7-triiodofluorescein were obtained
from the U.S. FDA.

2.2 Instrumentation
Method development,
quantification, and validation studies were performed on an Agilent
LC 1200 series (Agilent Technologies, Mississauga, ON, Canada) equipped
with a binary pump, a high-performance autosampler, a thermostated
autosampler unit, a thermostated column compartment, and a diode-array
(DAD) VL+ detector. Optimum separation of the 27 color additives was
achieved using a Poroshell SB-C18 column (3.0 × 100 mm, 2.7 μm)
from Agilent Technologies (Mississauga, ON) coupled with a C18 guard
column (3.0 × 4 mm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA).

2.3 Sample Preparation
Foodstuffs were
homogenized using a Retsch Grindomix commercial laboratory blender
(Newtown, PA, USA). Extraction procedures were performed using the
IKA RO10 multipositions magnetic stirring plate (Wilmington, NC, USA)
and the Branson CPX880 ultrasonic bath (Danbury, CT, USA). The centrifugation
step was performed using Thermo Sorvall Legend X1R centrifuge (Osterode,
Germany) with polypropylene 15 mL centrifuge tubes.

2.4 Chromatographic Conditions
The chromatographic
separation was achieved using a tertiary mixture of mobile phases.
Mobile phases A and B consisted of a mixture of a 50 mM ammonium acetate
solution, methanol, and acetonitrile, acidified by 0.1% (v/v) of glacial
acetic acid, with respective ratios of 97:3:0 (v/v) and 10:3:7 (v/v/v),
while mobile phase C consisted of a 1 M ammonium acetate solution,
methanol, and acetone in a ratio of 1:5:4 (v/v/v). The mobile phases
were delivered to the analytical column according to the gradient
program in Table 2.
Analyses were performed by injecting 25 μL at a flow rate of
0.75 mL/min and a column temperature of 60 °C. The LC column
was allowed to re-equilibrate for 1 min (post-time) prior to the next
injection. Agilent Technologies ChemStation software was used to monitor
and control all analytical conditions and to reprocess chromatographic
data, including library search. Seven different wavelengths were used
for identifying the color additives; 408, 428, 450, 506, 526, 540,
and 610 nm.

2.5 Standard Preparation
Individual standard
stock solutions of 200 μg/mL of each dye category (see Table 1) were prepared by
weighing 10 mg of each compound and dissolving into a 50 mL volumetric
flask using the corresponding diluent. On the basis of their physicochemical
properties, the analytes were divided in three groups: group I, II,
and III. For group I, ultrapure water was used as the diluent, whereas
groups II and III used mixtures of methanol and ultrapure water at
ratios of (1:25 v/v) and (1:10 v/v), respectively. Volumetric flasks
were sonicated for 1 min and wrapped with aluminum foil to protect
them from light. Stock solutions were stable for about 70 days when
kept refrigerated. Working standard solutions were prepared fresh
on a daily basis by pipetting aliquots of stock solutions and serial
dilutions with ultrapure water were made at concentrations to cover
the range of 0.025–50 μg/mL.

2.6 Extraction
Solutions
2.6.1 Ammonium Acetate Extraction Solutions
Two different solutions were prepared to conduct separate extractions.
A solvent mixture of methanol and 100 mM ammonium acetate solution
in proportions of 3:10 (v/v) was used as extraction solution 1, and
a mixture of the same solvents in proportions of 1:20 (v/v) was used
as extraction solution 2.

2.6.2 α-Amylase Solution
A solution
of about 900 units per mL (100 U/mg solids) was used for the enzymatic
treatment of starch-containing products during the extraction step.

2.7 Extraction Procedure
2.7.1 Starch-Containing
Commodities
A
10 g portion of each food commodity was weighed in duplicate and transferred
to 125 mL Erlenmeyers containing a magnetic stirring bar. To each
replicate, 5 mL of the α-amylase solution and 30 mL of the 100
mM ammonium acetate solution were added. Samples were stirred on a
magnetic stirring plate for 15 min. Then, 5 mL of methanol and 25
mL of 100 mM ammonium acetate solution (extraction solution 1) were
added to the first duplicate, and 30 mL of methanol and 25 mL of 100
mM ammonium acetate (extraction solution 2) were added to the second
duplicate. Agitation was maintained for 15 min. Samples were transferred
into an ultrasonic bath filled with water at a temperature of about
60 °C for 15 min. Extracts were quantitatively transferred into
100 mL volumetric flasks, then cooled down to room temperature prior
to filling to mark with 100 mM ammonium acetate solution. Volumetric
flasks were shaken, and about 12 mL was transferred into polypropylene
centrifuge tubes. Extracts were centrifuged for 5 min at 14 000
rpm at room temperature. The supernatant was transferred to LC vial,
and 25 μL was injected onto the LC system.

2.7.2 Other Commodities
Food colors were
extracted using the same procedure as described previously without
the enzymatic treatment step. The initial addition of the extraction
solution was performed with 35 mL of 100 mM ammonium acetate solution.

2.8 Method Validation
The LC-DAD method
developed was fully validated for selectivity, limit of detection
(LOD), limit of quantitation (LOQ), linearity, precision, accuracy,
recovery, and stability according to IUPAC and AOAC guidelines for
single-lab validation.32,33 Measurement of uncertainty was
estimated according to IUPAC and ISO guidelines.32,34,35

2.9 Selectivity
Selectivity
is the degree
to which a method can quantify the analyte accurately in the presence
of interferents.32 Matrices without any
food colors (blank) were tested for interferences, and selectivity
was evaluated with the chromatograms obtained with those of the same
blank matrices spiked with food colors, by comparing retention times
and diode-array detection at the corresponding wavelength.

2.10 LOD, LOQ, and Linearity
In broad
terms, the LOD is the smallest amount or concentration of the analyte
in the test sample that can be reliably distinguished from the blank
or background noise, which is equal to signal-to-noise ratios of 3
and 10, respectively.36 Linearity of the
detector response was verified with standard preparations for each
individual color additives included in the study over the range of
0.025–50 μg/mL. Standard stock solutions were appropriately
diluted on each experiment day, and the corresponding fresh calibration
curve solutions were used to calculate the concentration of the color
additives in the samples. Calibration curves for groups I to III were
generated by linear regression based on the peak area using quadratic
(1/x2 amount) weight fit to determine
the linearity of the responses. The parameters of the regression equations
obtained for the calibration curves are presented in Table 3.

of 10 (e.g., 10 g sample weighed into 100 mL v.f.).

d Calculated with a dilution factor
of 10 (e.g., 10 g sample weighed into 100 mL v.f.).

2.10.1 Precision
The
repeatability precision
[sr, relative standard deviation (RSDr)] of the LC method was evaluated by analyzing six replicates
of samples spiked with standards. The repeatability precision was
expressed as the mean RSD for the repeated determinations across all
food commodities. An intermediate precision was also tested by analyzing
six replicates of one single food commodity (Peppermint candies) spiked
with standards and was expressed as the mean RSD for the analysis
of the candies commodity (Jelly beans and Peppermint candies).

2.10.2 Accuracy
Accuracy (trueness) was
calculated as the relative difference between the determined concentrations
by LC from spiked recovery and the nominal concentrations (100%) of
all the color additives in sample preparations. The accuracy of the
method was expressed as the mean of recoveries of the color additives
for all twelve food matrices tested.

2.10.3 Recovery
Food commodities were
spiked with standard solutions at three concentration levels. Twelve
replicates were prepared and analyzed for all twelve foodstuffs included
in the validation study. Triplicate fortified samples were prepared
for the low and high levels, respectively, at 5 and 20 μg/g,
while six replicates were analyzed for the mid-level at 10 μg/g.
The dilution factor used to express final results in μg/g was
100 (final volume = 100 mL). The recovery (R) was
calculated by the method described in Appendix D of AOAC guidelines37 as Rmarginal = [(Cf – Cu)/Ca] × 100, where Cf is the concentration found in the spiked sample, Cu is the concentration in the unfortified sample,
whereas Ca is the added concentration
in the spiked sample. Typically, Ca is
calculated by injecting standard preparations with the same concentrations
as in spiked samples.

2.10.4 Stability
The
stability of the
standard preparations was conducted over a period of time. The stock
standard solutions containing all color additives were respectively
diluted to a 0.5 μg/mL concentration. The standard preparations
were injected, and the corresponding concentrations were calculated
against the calibration curves injected the same day. The same standard
stocks were re-diluted, and this was repeated over a period of time;
1, 7, 14, 30, 60, and 90 days. The concentrations were calculated
according to the calibrations curves originally injected (day 1).
The three standard solutions were injected after 60 days using the
calibration curves generated on day 1. The % difference was calculated
as the absolute value of the concentration calculated with the corresponding
calibration curve over the mean value of both concentrations.

2.10.5 Measurement of Uncertainty
Uncertainty
of a measurement is defined as “a parameter associated with
the result of a measurement that characterizes the dispersion of the
values that could reasonably be attributed to the measurand”.35 The sources of measurement uncertainty (i.e.,
weighing, standard stock solutions, sample preparations, calibration
curves, operator’s bias, as well as overall precision from
analyzed matrices) associated with the analysis of color additives
in food commodities were evaluated. Error components were estimated
and calculated as an expanded uncertainty (Uc) using a coverage factor (k) of 2 at the
confidence level of 95%. RSD values from the precision study were
used to evaluate the measurement of uncertainty. The pool of data
for color additives recoveries obtained on all food products tested
are expressed as the RSDpool values. Recoveries from the accuracy
(trueness or bias) study were used to calculate the standard uncertainty
(μ(Rm)). Therefore, the mean and
standard deviation of the recoveries obtained are included in the
measurement of uncertainty.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Analytical Characteristics
3.1.1 Optimization of Chromatographic Analysis
To develop
a method of analysis applicable to all color additives
cited in this study, a combination of several LC columns and mobile
phases were tested. Short and long LC columns as well as sub-2 μm
and core–shell packings were tested and evaluated to achieve
efficient resolution, satisfactory peak shape, and retention factor
(k′). Using the traditional LC system, high
back pressure was experienced with sub-2 μm columns, and the
flow rate had to be reduced considerably, thus affecting the total
duration of the chromatographic analysis. Several mobile phases composed
of sodium phosphate buffers, ion-pairing agents such as tetrabutyl
ammonium bisulfate (TBAB), tetrabutyl ammonium dihydrogen phosphate
(TBAP), ammonium formate, and ammonium acetate, mixed with different
ratios of methanol and acetonitrile, were used to achieve optimal
separation for all color additives. The results demonstrated that
the 50 mM ammonium acetate solution was the most suitable ion-pairing
agent in providing the optimal chromatography. In addition, the use
of ammonium acetate as the ion-pairing reagent is less expensive than
other commercially available quaternary ammonium salts (e.g., TBAP,
TBAB, octylammonium phosphate, etc.) cited in the literature.17,18,20−26,28,39 Separation and resolution were further improved for some color additives
by the addition of organic solvents into the mobile phases used. Methanol
and acetonitrile were used as organic modifiers to facilitate the
elution in the mid-range of the chromatography, while acetone in mobile
phase C coupled with ammonium acetate at a higher concentration (1
M) was used during the last portion of the chromatography to specifically
elute chlorophyllin.40,41 Retention factors (k′) were calculated as k′ = (tr – t0)/t0, where tr is the
retention time of the analyte and t0 is
the retention time of unretained compounds (solvent front). The k′ values were within the optimum range (k′ > 2) for satisfactory chromatographic elution,31 especially for the first three food colors eluted.
Other system suitability parameters such as peak symmetry and resolution
were satisfactory, and separation was highly efficient. Typical chromatograms
obtained from groups I, II, and III calibration curves injections

3.1.2 Identification and Quantitation
The retention times
and DAD absorption spectra of detected colors
were compared with standard preparations recorded in the spectral
library, and a corresponding factor for “analyte matching”
was generated. Although the wavelengths do not all correspond to respective
maximum absorption wavelengths for the individual compounds, they
were selected as to fit as the optimal ones for detecting all of the
color additives in one single analysis. Positive matching of color
additives triggered the quantitation step. Specifically, when a color
additive peak corresponding to either crocein orange G or orange II
was detected and identified, one single peak assignment was made.
The method of analysis does not allow for the separation of the two
analytes because of their extremely similar chemical structure as
well as their respective absorption spectrum. These compounds are
closely related as they are subsidiary dyes of sunset yellow FCF,
which is a permitted food color in many jurisdictions. When crocein
orange G or orange II was detected, the quantitation was applied to
the sum of the two compounds. Erythrosin yellowish was found to be
the only commercially available source of 2,4,5-triiodofluorescein.
The remaining amounts of the other two FDA compounds were therefore
used to conduct a study for determining correction factors with respect
to erythrosin yellowish. When the presence of subsidiary dyes of erythrosin
(4,5-diiodofluorescein and 2,4,7-triiodofluorescein) was detected
in foodstuffs, the quantitation was performed by applying the corresponding
correction factors. The factors used were 0.92 for 4,5-diiodofluorescein
(λ = 506 nm) and 1.15 for 2,4,7-triiodofluorescein (λ
= 540 nm). Color additives quantitation was calculated using the external
calibration curves from neat standard solutions.

3.2 Extraction Step
3.2.1 Sample Preparation
Laboratory blenders
were used to achieve satisfactory homogenization, while efficient
magnetic stirring coupled with adequate sonication step helped in
the extraction step.

3.2.2 Optimization of Extraction
Efficiency
Several extraction solutions were tested during
this study, where
the concentration of the ammonium acetate solution and the proportion
of methanol were varied. Three concentrations of ammonium acetate
solution were used, and 4 different proportions of methanol were tried
and tested. Table 5 shows the recovery results for color additives at different compositions
of extraction solutions for one food commodity (multicolored candies).
Recoveries for color additives show fairly similar results in terms
of the concentration of ammonium acetate solution at 20 and 50 mM.
Specific color additives such as tartrazine, 4,5-diiodofluorescein,
and chrysoidine G showed results slightly lower than the average across
the four proportions of methanol tested. We observed that the best
recoveries for tartrazine were obtained with the lowest methanol proportion
(5%), while the opposite was observed for 4,5-diiodofluorescein and
chrysoidine G. The same trend was observed in terms of results for
the 100 mM ammonium acetate concentration. From those results, the
100 mM ammonium acetate solution was the most efficient and suitable
concentration. This ion-pairing agent concentration facilitated the
extraction of the color additives from food matrices, while methanol
further improved recoveries of some of the color additives, particularly
for erythrosine and its subsidiary dyes, rhodamine B as well as chrysoidine
G. The use of extraction solution 1 demonstrated the optimal extraction
and chromatography of dyes in food commodities, while the extraction
solution 2 showed the optimal chromatography specifically for three
analytes in group I (tartrazine, amaranth, and indigo carmine). These
food colors are the first compounds eluted by LC with respect to their
chromatographic affinity and chemical structure. The difference in
organic strength between the extracts injected and the mobile phase
used at the beginning of the gradient elution led to a modification
in the extraction solution for these compounds. When methanol is over
10% (v/v) in the extraction solution, we clearly saw the impact on
the chromatographic peak shape. A slight change in the proportion
of methanol was made to extract, recover, and improve the chromatographic
elution of these compounds. Overall, two different extractions solutions
were necessary for quantitative determination of color additives in
food commodities: extraction solutions 1 and 2, respectively with
100 mM ammonium acetate and methanol, at ratios of 70:30 and 95:5
(v/v).

3.2.3 Enzymatic Treatment
An α-amylase
solution was used to perform an enzymatic hydrolysis of the polysaccharide
links [α(1 → 4)] present in the foodstuffs analyzed into
maltose disaccharides fragments. The extraction and recovery of color
additives were considerably increased when starch-containing commodities
were treated with α-amylase during the extraction step, followed
by the sonication step. Recovery results are presented in Table 6.

Hot chilli powder was selected to investigate the effect of filtration
and centrifugation on the recoveries. An average of 8% loss was observed
after filtration on the polytetrafluoroethylene membrane. In some
cases, the color adsorption resulted in an intense staining of the
filter. Given the results obtained, the centrifugation step was chosen
and applied to the method validation.

3.3 Method
Validation
Twelve different
foodstuffs including beverages, candies,2 baked goods, chips, spices, fish and fish roe, dairy products, breakfast
cereals,2 as well as savory sauces were
purchased from retail stores. Food commodities chosen were selected
to cover as many sectors of the AOAC food triangle. Figure 2 shows the AOAC food triangle
based on the relative levels of fat, protein, and carbohydrate, as
well as the triangle sectors covered with commodities analyzed. Although
commodities are analyzed among several food categories, a specific
trend was studied in starch-containing and other commodities.

Figure 2 AOAC food triangle
and food commodities analyzed during the validation
study.

3.3.1 Selectivity
First, several matrices
were tested to determine if they contained color additives or not.
The selected food matrices were chips, sauces, spices, fish roe and
fish meat, orange juice, and yogurt and were chosen so as to reflect
as closely as possible the different sectors (sectors 2, 5, and 9)
of the food triangle covered with all food commodities tested during
method validation. None of the tested commodities showed interferences
when compared with spiked samples.

3.3.2 LOD,
LOQ, and Linearity
Instrumental
LOD and LOQ were determined by injecting diluted standard preparations
used to generate the respective calibration curves. The concentration
corresponding to the limit of quantitation was recorded as the lowest
level of the calibration ranges. The linearity of the detector response
was evaluated by injecting seven concentration levels from 0.025 to
50 μg/mL for food colors of group I, and five concentration
levels from 0.025 to 20 μg/mL for color additives of groups
II and III. The different LODs and LOQs, as well as calculated parameters
for linearity are presented in Table 3. Corresponding sample LODs and LOQs were determined
by including the dilution factor for samples10 into the calculation. Sample LOQs ranged from 0.2 to 1.5 μg/g
with an average of 0.6 μg/g, demonstrating the sharp sensitivity
of the method. For instance, LODs and LOQs for amaranth (acid red
27) and for fast red E (acid red 88) are substantially similar and
in the same order of magnitude as those cited in the literature for
the same food dyes.18

3.3.3 Precision
The repeatability precision
(sr, RSDr) was expressed as
the mean RSD and was calculated from repeated determinations across
the twelve food commodities tested. RSD was calculated with color
additive recoveries from replicate sample preparations (n = 6) at one single concentration level (10 μg/g). On the other
hand, intermediate precision was calculated with recoveries of color
additives from replicate sample preparations on a different day. Data
from the candies tested (jelly beans and peppermints), corresponding
to sector no. 5 of the AOAC food triangle, were used to calculate
the intermediate precision mean RSD. The overall precision was below
10%. The full intraday and interday precision data are shown in Table 7.

b 2,4,7-Triiodofluororescein was not
included in the solution used to spike color additives of group II.
The concentration of the spiked solutions for groups I, II, and III
were at about 10 μg/g (n = 6).

3.3.4 Accuracy
An average of about 70%
accuracy was recorded for each compound group evaluated (I, II, and
III). Lower results (<50%) were encountered for chlorophyllin,
erythrosin, bordeaux R, 2,4,5-triiodofluorescein, chrysoidine G, and
eosin Y. Accuracy data are summarized in Table 7.

3.3.5 Recovery
The
different food commodities
tested were spiked with standard solutions of all color additives
at three spiking concentrations. Recoveries of color additives26 from spiked samples for all food commodities
tested12 averaged about 70% along the three
spiking levels run. Similar recovery results were obtained for all
food dyes in the same types of spiked food commodities as those cited
in the literature.19,27 Lower recovery results were found
in specific commodities and for individual food dyes such as erythrosine
and chlorophyllin which appeared to be related to the dyes’
binding to the proteins present in the samples analyzed. Results are
presented in Table 7.

3.3.6 Stability
Given the difference
in concentrations across all color additives, a difference of 10%
(overall mean) or less was obtained and corresponded to a lifetime
of 60 days. Therefore, 0.5 μg/mL of standard stock solutions
was kept to re-prepare diluted standard preparations for not more
than 61 days, refrigerated, and kept away from light.

3.4 Measurement of Uncertainty
The combined
standard uncertainty (Uc) for each color
additive was calculated, and the confidence factor of k = 2, with a confidence level of 95%, was applied to calculate the
expanded uncertainty. Overall, the expanded uncertainty (U) for all color additives and foods is averaged to 29%.

4 Conclusions
The validation results demonstrated the
purpose, sensitivity, and
fitness for purpose of the method to simultaneously quantitate color
additives in food matrices. The use of two extraction solutions was
the best compromise to maximize efficiency, chromatographic resolution,
and ensure short analysis time. In terms of color additives extraction,
the use of ammonium acetate as the ion-pairing agent offers similar
performance as other cationic ion-pairing agents at a fraction of
the price. The method uses successful color additives extraction and
cleanup procedures to avoid the interference from complex food matrices,
thereby offering a combination of selectivity and ease of use at low
cost. The LC UV–vis analytical method described
herein is a successful approach to separate and quantitate color additives
in food commodities; it therefore expands the scope to analyze a broad
variety of market samples. Since its implementation, the method has
been used to analyze nearly 3000 food samples.
