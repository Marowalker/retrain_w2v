Protein
kinases are fundamental within almost all cellular signal
transduction networks. Among these, Bruton’s tyrosine kinase
(Btk), which belongs to the Tec family of proteins, plays an imperative
part in B-cell signaling. Owing to its role, Btk has been established
as an important therapeutic target for a vast range of disorders related
to B-cell development and function, such as the X-linked agammaglobulinemia,
various B-cell malignancies, inflammation, and autoimmune diseases.
Herein, using computer-based screening of a library of 20 million
small molecules, we identified a small molecule capable of directly
binding the Btk kinase domain. On the basis of this hit compound,
we conducted a focused structure-similarity search to explore the
effect of different chemical modifications on binding toward Btk.
This search identified the molecule N2,N6-bis(2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-6-yl)-9H-purine-2,6-diamine as a potent inhibitor of Btk. The latter
small molecule binds Btk with a dissociation constant of 250 nM and
inhibits Btk activity both in vitro and in-cell.

==== Body
Introduction
Bruton’s
tyrosine kinase (Btk) is a member of the Tec family
kinases (TFKs), which form one of the largest kinase families in mammalians.1,2 TFK expression in different tissues plays an important role in a
vast range of cellular signaling,3−5 and TFKs have been recognized
as key players in B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling. Within
this family, the cytoplasmic Btk is mainly expressed in myeloid- and
B-cells acting within a broad range of processes, including cell-cycle
progression and apoptosis, and Btk has been directly linked to inflammatory
responses and chronic inflammatory diseases.6Figure 1A shows a
schematic representation of Btk’s primary structure. It consists
of 659 amino acids arranged into five distinct functional domains,
each having a unique structure–function implication within
the context of the cellular pathway.7 Following
the binding of an antigen to the BCR, activated Btk is phosphorylated
by the SRC kinases Lyn or Syk, and is also autophosphorylated at a
specific Tyr residue.8−11 These phosphorylation events further trigger the downstream phosphorylation
of phospholipase-C-γ-2 (PLCγ2) by Btk.12 Activated PLCγ2 hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol,
resulting in the activation of protein kinase C (PKC).13 It has been shown that the magnitude
and duration of Btk-driven PKC signaling are dependent on PLCγ2
activity, which can also affect the activation of important transcription
factors, such as NFκB, AP-1, and NFAT.14−16 Considering
the crucial part Btk plays in the phosphorylation and activation of
PLCγ2, and henceforth in the activation of the NFκB pathway,17,18 Btk has an immense role in B-Cell regulation and is further involved
in its development, proliferation, maturation, and apoptosis.19−21 In addition, a large number of cellular abnormalities were found
to be associated with nonfunctioning mutant Btk or dysregulation of
Btk. For example, although the phenotype of X-linked agammaglobulinemia
was discovered more than half a century ago,22 it took about two decades to link it to a mutation in the gene encoding
the Btk.23,24 In addition, key roles of Btk were shown
in different malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia,25,26 acute myeloid leukemia (AML),27 and multiple
myeloma.28

domain architecture. It
has five distinct domains: pleckstrin homology (PH), Tec homology
(TH), Src homology 3 (SH3), Src homology 2 (SH2), and the kinase domain.

This involvement of Btk in various immune-mediated
disorders and
cancer contributes to the on-going challenge to develop small molecule
inhibitors that can bind and inhibit Btk, and thus act as a therapeutic
substance in various Btk-related pathways. Indeed, a variety of different
inhibitors have been discovered and developed,29−35 but currently only the nonreversible inhibitor ibrutinib has received
approval as a drug for targeting Btk.36,37 Herein, we
present the discovery of a reversible small molecule inhibitor that
can directly bind the Btk kinase domain and inhibit its kinase activity.
Using computer-aided drug design tools, we virtually screened a library
of 20 million compounds that were filtered according to preset criteria.
Following the virtual screening, we applied a set of biophysical,
biochemical, and cellular characterization tools to validate the activity
of the new molecule targeting Btk.

Results
In Silico Screening
To find new, small molecule inhibitors
that can target the Btk kinase domain, we virtually screened a database
of about 20 million available small molecules. Figure S1 illustrates the workflow of the virtual screening
process designed to search and filter potential Btk inhibitors. This
process consisted of the following steps: (i) structural analysis
of all available structures of Btk to generate a single averaged model,
(ii) analysis of known Btk binders from the publicly available cocrystals
and extraction of the required pharmacophore constraints, (iii) crude
filtering of the virtual library according to the required pharmacophore
features, (iv) docking and clustering of the virtual compounds passing
the first pharmacophore filter, and (v) ranking and manual selection
of top compounds for the next in vitro validation. Finally, we purchased
a subset of ∼90 compounds for the in vitro screening, taking
under consideration the tradeoff between success rates and cost-effective
procedures. This set of compounds covered the largest possible chemical
space, while still addressing the desired physiochemical criteria
to ensure optimal binding.

Btk Kinase Domain Expression and Purification
To test
the selected set of small molecules that passed the previously described
computational filters, we set up orthogonal in vitro assays. For this
purpose, we expressed the recombinant Btk kinase domain-containing
residues 387–569 with cleavable N-terminus six-histidine and
maltose binding protein (MBP) tags, for purification and increased
solubility, respectively. Figure 1B shows the purification process of the protein. The
left SDS-PAGE gel shows the purification of the protein using a nickel
column. Purified MBP-tagged Btk kinase domain was eluted from the
nickel column. Following cleavage by PP, the eluted fraction was repassed
through the nickel column, to separate the purified Btk kinase domain
from the MBP and histidine tags.

Establishing a “3-Injections”
Iso Thermal Calorimetry
(ITC) Experimental Setup for the Detection of Btk Small Molecule Binders
Following expression of the recombinant Btk kinase domain, we sought
to test the subset of compounds that were purchased at the end of
the in silico screening for binding. To that end, we used ITC, which
is capable of measuring the direct heat change occurring due to the
interaction of a pair of molecules.38,39 ITC has certain
advantages, such as the capability to detect a relatively broad range
of binding affinities, being a label-free method, and providing a
wide set of interaction parameters, such as the affinity, stoichiometry,
enthalpy, and entropy of binding. However, ITC also has a few disadvantages
that limit its suitability to only low-throughput screening applications,
or as a secondary tool for binding validation. Moreover, a relatively
large quantity of protein is required for a single experiment, and
performing a complete binding curve is time consuming. To overcome
these limitations, we used the 3-injections ITC experiment, as depicted
in Figure 2.40 In this experimental scheme, the protein was
placed in the ITC syringe and injected into the cell containing the
compound. A binary decision regarding the binding of a specific molecule
was then obtained based on the absolute and/or change in heat magnitude
of the different injections. To set up the experimental conditions
for the Btk screening, we tested the 3-injections ITC experiment on
RN-486 and LFM-A13, reference molecules known to bind Btk with a dissociation
constant of 5 nM and 1 μM, respectively. Figure 2B shows the thermographs obtained following
the injection of Btk into each of these compounds, as well as into
the experimental buffer, used as a control. This data was produced
by monitoring a series of 3 injections of Btk, 3 μL each, into
the ITC cell containing the target molecule. By using only 9 μL
of protein at a concentration of 300 μM, we were able to obtain
a binary result regarding the binding event. Although a lower volume
and concentration could have been used, this setup aimed at detecting
molecules that may have higher kd values,
as one would expect with preliminary hits from virtual screening.
It can be seen (Figure 2B) that two factors were correlated with the binding of Btk to the
reference molecules. The first was the magnitude of the heat in μcal/s
that was observed with each injection. The second was the change in
heat that can be observed between two consecutive injections. Given
that some of the molecules are already bound to Btk following the
first injection, the lower number of binding events in the ITC cell
in the second and in each of the following injections result in lower
heat dissipation.

of the 3-injection ITC experiment. In this setup, the protein was
placed in the syringe and the small molecule was placed in the ITC
cell. Three injections were executed and both the heat magnitude and
trend were correlated to find preliminary positive protein–ligand
interactions. (B) 3-injection ITC experiment with [left] RN-486, an

In Vitro Screening of Candidate Compounds
for Binding to BtK
Kinase Domain Using the 3-Injections ITC Experiment
The candidate
small molecules were tested for binding to the Btk kinase domain using
the described established biophysical assay. For this purpose, each
of the molecules was placed in the ITC cell in a concentration of
30 μM, and three injections of Btk kinase domain, in a concentration
of 300 μM and a volume of 3 μL, were performed. To obtain
a binary decision regarding the binding of the different molecules,
we monitored the change in released or absorbed heat. Figure 3A shows the raw data obtained
for 81 3-injection ITC experiments. The raw data, including the peak
height and shape, was used to provide an initial assessment of the
binding data. Indeed, whereas most mixtures show a low exothermic
or endothermic reaction with approximately the same magnitude of energy
change, a few panels show a potentially ITC detected binding event.
In addition to the manual inspection of the data set, we also calculated
a numerical value of the energy change, for each of the injections,
as described elsewhere.40 Therefore, we
normalized all curves to a zero baseline, by means of an auxiliary
fitting procedure (applying vertical translations and rotations).
Curves with negative energy peaks (exothermic reactions) were mirrored
around the horizontal axis. Following integration of the heat peaks,
we ran the least absolute deviations curve-fitting procedure to fit
the peaks to a function of the form fKeff(x) = 1 – [PLKeff], where [PLKeff] is the protein–ligand concentration
in each injection according to the solution of a single site binding
model  where L0 and P0 are the initial ligand
and protein concentrations,
and Keff is the effective dissociation
constant being sought. Figure 3B shows a bar plot of the raw Keff values attained by fitting the different experiments. Naturally,
in the majority of mixtures, no binding event occurred, which is reflected
by the scattered values around the zero baseline. An exception is
observed in compound 77, wherein the supposed binding event produced
a large heat difference between each injection. To validate and better
evaluate the initial affinity of the small molecule compound that
showed binding to Btk in the 3-injection assay, we measured the full
ITC binding curve, as depicted in Figure 4A. For this purpose, we performed a full
ITC titration experiment employing a series of 14 injections of 2.5
μL each. The fitting of the raw data ITC curve to a single binding-site
model yielded an association constant of 2.71 × 105 M–1 (kd ∼ 3.4
μM). Figure 4B shows the chemical structure of the molecule identified as a binder
of the Btk kinase domain.

of three sequential injections of 300 μM Btk kinase domain into
30 μM compound separated by a 120 s delay. (B) Bar graph shows
the attained Keff value upon curve-fitting
the tested ITC to f(x) = 1 –

are reflective of a decreasing heat release and may be attributed
to interacting molecules. The bar and ITC panel showing the best binder
according to the model are highlighted by an asterisk.

of 120 s between each consecutive injection was executed. On the basis
of the ITC experiment, the depicted molecule binds Btk with a dissociation
constant of 3.7 μM. (B) Chemical structure of the preliminary
in vitro hit.

Focused Structure-Similarity
Activity Study
In addition
to ITC, which serves as an excellent biophysical tool to determine
the binding of a molecule to the target protein, it is crucial to
test additional compounds with similar structures. Although a common
course of action is usually to perform a structure–activity
relationship (SAR) study in which a set of analogues with chemical
modifications is synthesized, the required resources for that purpose
are high. An alternative approach that we have taken here is to search
for structurally similar compounds and devise a set of relevant analogues.
Each of the structurally similar compounds is then subjected to docking
and ranking using the same principal parameters used for the virtual
screening process, and potential binders are then purchased and tested
as described below. Looking at the chemical structure of the compound
depicted in Figure 4B reveals several distinctive functional groups, such as a purine,
phenyl, and morpholine ring. A study of structurally similar chemical
analogous can thus expand our understanding of the functional moieties
that best contribute to the binding of Btk. To this end, we tested
compounds that exhibited structural similarities to our initial hit. Figure 5 shows six different
molecules, each exhibiting different chemical substitutions, which
were tested for binding to the Btk kinase domain by ITC. Compound
L3, which underwent multiple modifications compared to the initial
hit detected by the computational screen, showed no binding to BtK.
We then explored specific modifications. Compound L1 has two methoxy
groups on the benzene ring that substituted the fluorine atom of the
original compound in Figure 4B. It showed relatively weak affinity toward Btk that was
on the same order of magnitude as the initial hit. On the basis of
the compounds tested, the benzene functional group seems crucial for
binding whilst both fluorine and methoxy can serve as functional groups.
Compound L2 had a morpholine to pyrolidine substitution. Unlike the
previous case, this single chemical modification diminished the interaction
of the molecule with Btk. This demonstrated that the size or shape
of the morpholine ring, or possibly the physiochemical properties
of the oxygen, are important for the interaction with Btk. Nevertheless,
as compound L4, containing the methoxy-benzene substitution but lacking
the morpholine ring, did show weak signs of binding toward Btk, we
put more emphasis on methoxy-benzene for obtaining high affinity toward
Btk. Indeed, compounds L5 and L6, which exhibited two oxygen-containing
functional groups on the benzene, showed medium and high affinity
toward Btk, respectively. Between the latter two compounds, L6, which
has two benzene-attached dioxane rings, showed prominent binding to
Btk with kd = 250 nM. The dissociation
constants of molecules L1–L6 toward Btk are summarized in Table 1.

of ITC experiments conducted on six different compounds (L1–L6).
Compounds L2–L4 showed effectively no or very weak binding.
Compounds L1 and L5 had a dissociation constant of 5 and 1 μM,
respectively. Compound L6 had the best affinity toward Btk with a
dissociation constant of 0.25 μM.

L5	1000	
L6	250	
In addition to the ITC experiment, which demonstrated
direct binding
of compound L6 to Btk kinase domain, we tested binding in an orthogonal
biophysical assay using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF). In
this approach, the temperature dependence of the 350–330 nm
tryptophan fluorescence ratio is correlated. On the basis of this
ratio, the melting temperature (Tm) of
the protein in the free and bound forms can be extracted. Figure S2 shows the melting curves and the calculated Tm of Btk with and without compound L6. It is
important to note that in a previous study, a similar molecule was
found to bind BRAF kinase with approximately 1 order of magnitude
lower potency (a dissociation constant of kd = 5200 nM41). This significant difference
in binding may be explained by a relatively low homology (identity
of 27.6% and similarity of 56.7%) between the kinase domain of BRAF
(residues 457–717) and Btk (residues 402–655), as is
depicted in Figure S4. In addition, the
improved activity toward Btk inhibition is further supported by Table 2.

Inhibition
Validation by Biochemical and Cellular Assays
To validate
the ability of compound L6 to bind Btk kinase domain
and to interfere with its phosphorylation activity, we designed a
simple yet direct in vitro assay. Specifically, we monitored the phosphorylation
of the peptide NH2-KKVVALYDYMPMN-COOH corresponding to
residues 217–229 in the full-length Btk, which included the
autophosphorylated tyrosine, and served as an established in vitro
substrate for Btk.42Figure 6A shows western blot (WB) analysis following
the kinase in vitro assay in the absence and in the presence of 50
μM molecule L6. As a positive control, and given its superior
affinity, we used the known Btk inhibitor RN-486 in a concentration
of 1 μM.43 We found that compound
L6 demonstrated significant inhibition of Btk kinase activity. We
next aimed to validate the inhibitory effect of the small molecule
in the cellular setting. We specifically tested the ability of the
identified compounds to inhibit Btk in U937 human monocyte cells.
The latter were incubated with RN-486 and the compounds L1–L6
in a concentration of 1 and 20 μM, respectively. Cells were
further activated by the phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate.44,45Figure 6B shows WB
analysis of the cellular extract following treatment with the compounds
using phospho-Btk, phospho-PLCγ2, and α-Tubulin antibodies.
It can be seen that the small molecules interfered with Btk autophosphorylation
as well as with the downstream phosphorylation of its main substrate
PLCγ2. In the last step, we characterized the EC50 of molecule
L6. Figure 6C shows
WB analysis of the dose–response effect of molecule L6 within
the cellular environment. On the basis of the bands’ magnitude,
it can be estimated that the molecule L6 shows a cellular EC50 of
about 5 μM.

L1–L6 on Btk kinase activity was estimated by WB analysis.

on phosphor-BtK, lanes 4–9: the addition of 20 μM of
each of the molecules in Figure 5. (C) Dose–response of compound L6 analyzed
by WB using phospho-Btk. U937 cells were incubated with increasing
concentrations of compound L6, and the cell lysates were analyzed
for Btk phosphorylation level.

L6 Specificity Panel
To assess the specificity of L6
molecule toward Btk in comparison with other kinases, we performed
a single-point activity assay toward a focused list of 40 kinases,
which were mostly part of the TK family. Screening was executed at
a compound concentration of 10 μM. Table 2 shows the kinase name versus the percent
activity score given relative to a control test and fold activity
relative to Btk. Although the score is not an affinity measurement,
it represents the hit probability. Roughly speaking, hits less than
1% suggest that the dissociation constant (kd) is most likely less than 1 μM. It can be seen that
among the kinases in the list, only three exhibit such probability,
including Btk. Moreover, in about 90% of the tested kinases, there
is at least a 2-fold decrease in activity potency and in more than
60% of the tested kinases, the difference is of more than an order
of magnitude.

Discussion
Btk serves as an important
therapeutic target, mainly in conditions
that are associated with B-cell regulation, such as inflammation and
autoimmune diseases. Indeed, the nonreversible covalent inhibitor
Ibrutinib, a first-in-class small molecule drug, shows effective activity
in a range of B-cell related clinical disorders. Yet, there is still
immense need for the discovery of new inhibitors that present different
pharmacological patterns. In this study, we described the discovery,
via rational drug design, and characterization of a new small molecule
inhibitor of Btk, namely, compound L6, with a dissociation constant
(kd) of 250 nM.

Generally speaking,
protein kinases share a conserved ATP binding
site located between two lobes that are connected by the hinge domain,
as depicted in Figure 7A on the Btk model. Kinase inhibitors targeting the ATP site usually
bind this region.46 Thus, selectivity toward
a specific kinase should foster additional interactions that are unique
to the kinase of interest. In this context, the Gly-rich loop and
activation loop of Btk form a hydrophobic pocket that is distinctive
to Btk and was targeted in our screening. The general chemical scaffold
of the inhibitor that can be extracted from the selected compounds
has a central purine of which the C2 and C6 are substituted by NH–R
and R′. However, in the case of L6, the NH–R is identical
to the R′ group. The chemical properties governing the binding
of compound L6 to Btk kinase domain include a central purine group
flanked by two benzene-attached dioxane rings connected via an amine
bond. The purine central group forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone
of Btk Met477 located within the hinge domain, as depicted in Figure 7B. In this model,
the C2-substituted NH and N3 of the pyrimidine form two hydrogen bonds
with the amide and carboxyl backbone of Ser477 located on the hinge
domain of Btk. In addition, one of the dioxane rings is located at
the entrance of the unique hydrophobic pocket of Btk and forms a hydrogen
bond with Lys430. The latter may contribute toward the superior selectivity
of the compound to Btk. A full map of interactions between the L6
compound and Btk kinase domain is shown in Figure S3. Our in vitro results are supported by the cellular activity
assays depicted in Figure 6B. The strong correlation between the in vitro binding and
the cellular inhibition of Btk and PLCγ2 highlights the mechanism
of action of the compounds found herein. Although L6 is not yet considered
to be a lead molecule, the biophysical data and the relatively high
specificity toward Btk, as demonstrated in Table 2, mark compound L6 as a promising inhibitor
and an excellent candidate for further development.

Within the challenging task of drug development, we demonstrated
that combining virtual screening with biophysical tools that can measure
direct binding affinities provides a powerful platform for the discovery
of new bioactive molecules. Specifically, we used ITC as an in vitro
screening technique secondary to in silico methods. The presented
3-injections ITC method provides a biophysical high-throughput tool
to measure direct binding affinities, which allows direct chemical
optimization toward the development of potent inhibitors. The strong
correlation between ITC-derived data (kd) and the biochemical and cellular assays points to the validity
and potential of this approach. The initial affinity of compound L6
is an excellent starting point for studying its pharmacological properties
and selectivity. Our current understanding of the SARs and the promising
cellular activity of compound L6 pave the way for the development
of an anti-Btk clinically approved small molecule drug.

Experimental

Computational
Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations
The MD cascade
protocol included 5000 minimization steps followed by 500 ps of system
heating to 300 K and an additional 500 ps of equilibration steps.
The final production run (out of which snapshots for analysis were
obtained) of 500 ns was distributed on a 120 core HPC server (4 HP
ProLiant SL230s Gen8 servers with dual Intel Xeon E5-2670 CPUs). root-mean-square
deviation and energy profile analysis along the simulation trajectory
were done to verify convergence of the simulation and its correctness.

Generating a Three-Dimensional (3D) Model Used for Docking
An average structure based on all available Btk kinase domain crystal
structures was generated and subsequent MD simulations were carried
out with the program CHARMM47 to refine
the model. Weak harmonic constraints were used to limit Btk backbone
movements during the entire simulation. On the basis of the results
of this analysis, we generated a single average model that was used
for molecular docking.

Library Size Reduction Based on Profiling
and Crude Pharmacophore
Filtering
Library profiling was based on analysis of the
interaction pattern between known small molecule binders and Btk.
The fitting procedure was initiated by rapid filtering of compounds
based on the basic molecular features, followed by a rigid matching
in the 3D space to a “crude” pharmacophore model consisting
of only 3–4 required features. This process was repeated for
each molecule’s conformer to filter out molecules that were
unable to satisfy the pharmacophore requirements. Pharmacophore hypothesis
and filtering were done using the search DB algorithm in Catalyst
program.48,49 Small molecules that fulfilled all required
features within the geometrical constraints of the pharmacophore model
were then ranked by “fitting value”—a calculated
score based on the distance between all features in the model, and
the chemical groups’ actual position in the small molecule.
The result of this step was a reduction of the library size to approximately
500 000 compounds.

Molecular Docking and Final Compound Selection
Molecular
docking of the profiled library was done using the GOLD program,50,51 with preset genetic algorithm settings optimized for virtual screening.
A post-docking scoring function was applied to rank each docking pose.
A cutoff value was used to filter out compounds that did not satisfy
specific location constraints and also to account for putative ligand
interacting groups in addition to the structure-based complementary
ones.

Insect Cell Culture
Insect cells
sf9 and Trichoplusia ni (Tni) together
with culture media
(cat# 96-001) were purchased from Expression Systems Llc.

Protein Expression
and Purification
The human Btk kinase
domain, which includes residues 387–569, was produced as a
cleavable MBP fusion protein and HISx6 tag containing a PP recognition
site based on the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system. More specifically,
the Btk kinase domain gene was cloned into pFastBAC1 donor plasmid.
Thereafter, pFastBAC1, carrying the gene of interest, was transformed
into DH10Bac cells and recombinant bacmid was then used to generate
the baculoviral stock. In the first step, sf9 cells were transfected
with the latter viral suspension and Btk-related virus was produced.
Then, Tni cells were transfected with 4% v/v of the previous viral
suspension and grown for 72 h at 29 °C. To extract the protein,
the cells were harvested and resuspended in 30 mL of 50 mM Tris–HCl
(pH = 8), 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 5 mM ßME, and 0.5% glycerol.
The suspended cells were then disrupted by sonication and the insoluble
fraction was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 15 000
g. The supernatant was applied to a 5 mL column of nickel beads. After
washing the resin with 40 mL of 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH = 8), 300
mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 5 mM ßME, and 5% glycerol, the protein
was eluted with the same buffer containing 300 mM imidazole. The elution
fraction was concentrated to 5–10 mL using 10 000-MWC
membrane ultrafiltration. PP was added to the concentrated elution
fraction, and the solution was dialyzed with 1 L of Tris with 10 mM
imidazole. The digested solution was applied to the nickel column
again and the flow-through containing Btk was collected.

ITC
The purified protein was placed in a 6–8
MWCO dialysis bag in 30 mM phosphate buffer, 30 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP,
and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. Sequential buffer exchange dialyses were
executed for 12 h each at 4 °C until dilution of >10 000
was achieved. ITC binding constant evaluation was estimated using
the calorimetric analysis program in the Origin suite.52 Extraction of Keff based on the 3-injections ITC technique was conducted in MATLAB.

Biochemical Assay
For the in vitro kinase assay, Btk-derived
peptide was suspended in the kinase assay buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5,
10 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM MnCl2 and 500 mM ATP)
in the presence of the different compounds with indicated concentration
in the text. Reactions were performed at 25 °C for 30 min. The
kinase reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer
followed by boiling for 5 min. All samples were separated by SDS-PAGE
and transferred to WB analysis to monitor phosphorylation levels with
antibody Phospho-Btk Y223 analysis (Abcam Cat. Ab68217).

Cellular Assay
AML cell line U937 cells were cultured
in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified
incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2. WB analysis was conducted
for protein levels of phospho-Btk Y223 (Abcam. Cat. AB68217), phospho-PLCγ2
(Cell Signaling. Cat. 3874), and α-tubulin (Santa Cruz. Cat.
SC8035). Cells were treated with the compounds for 18 h and activated
with 100 μM pervenadate for 20 min. Cellular lysate was analyzed
with the indicated Abs.

Small Molecule Chemistry
All molecules
were purchased
or synthesized by Akos GmbH or Enamine Ltd.

Kinome Scan
Selectivity
profiling was executed by DiscoverX
using KinomeScan Technology.
