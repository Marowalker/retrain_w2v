The emergence of
multidrug-resistant microbes is a significant
health concern posing a constant need for new antimicrobials. Membrane-targeting
antibiotics are promising candidates with reduced ability of microbes
to develop resistance. In the present investigation, the principal
reason behind choosing cholic acid as the crucial scaffold lies in
the fact that it has a facially amphiphilic nature, which provides
ample opportunity to refine the amphiphilicity by linking the amino
acid lysine. A total of 16 novel amphipathic cholic acid derivatives
were synthesized by sequentially linking lysine to C3-β-amino
cholic acid methyl ester to maintain the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance,
which could be the essential requirement for the antimicrobial activity.
Among the synthesized conjugates, a series with fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl
moiety attached to cholic acid via lysine linker showed promising
antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. A pronounced effect of increase
in lysine residues was noted on the observed activity. The lead compounds
were found to be active against drug-resistant bacterial and fungal
clinical isolates and also improved the efficacy of antifungal agents
amphotericin B and voriconazole. Membrane-permeability studies demonstrated
the ability of these compounds to induce membrane damage in the tested
microbes. The active conjugates did not show any hemolytic activity
and were also found to be nontoxic to the normal cells as well as
the examined cancer cell lines. The observed antimicrobial activity
was attributed to the facial amphiphilic conformations, hydrophobic/hydrophilic
balance, and the overall charge on the molecules.

Introduction
Antimicrobial resistance
is emerging as a significant public health
concern worldwide, with several common microbial pathogens associated
with hospital- and/or community-acquired infections being increasingly
reported to be drug resistant. These include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; third-generation cephalosporin,
fluoroquinolone- or carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (including Escherichia coli); multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and fluconazole-resistant Candida. Recently, Candida auris has also emerged as an important antifungal-resistant
nosocomial pathogen implicated in a variety of diseases across five
continents. Infections caused by such pathogens often lead to higher
medical costs and longer periods of treatment and end up with greater
morbidity and mortality rates.1−5 As a result, there is an immediate need to develop new classes of
potent antimicrobials with a novel mechanism of action and a potential
to combat the infections caused by drug-resistant microbes. Membrane-targeting
antibiotics have emerged as promising candidates in this regard because
of the reduced ability of microbes to develop resistance against them.6 In search of membrane-targeting antibiotics,
several amphiphilic molecules have been reported as effective antimicrobials.
Cationic antimicrobial peptides are the promising candidates, which
are naturally occurring amphiphilic molecules produced by the host
defense system as a part of the innate immune response. These peptides
display wide structural heterogeneity due to variable amino acid sequences
and are effective against a broad spectrum of infections, ranging
from Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria and fungal to protozoal
and viral infections.7−9 The structural integrity of antimicrobial peptides
allows them to adopt different amphiphilic conformations responsible
for the antimicrobial activity,10,11 but limited emphasis
has been placed to investigate the exact role of different amphiphilic
conformations for the variable antimicrobial activity.12,13

Squalamine 1 (Figure 1), initially isolated from a dogfish shark,
is another
type of cationic amphiphilic steroid polyamine conjugate with a unique
chemical structure where a polyamine spermidine is attached to a hydrophobic
steroid scaffold.14 Squalamine is exceptionally
attractive because of its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against
plethora of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and has potential
for the development of a new class of antimicrobial agents. The fact
that insufficient amounts of squalamine were available for mechanistic
studies coupled with the challenges involved in its synthesis because
of its structural complexity15 prompted
several research groups to synthesize squalamine analogues such as 2 by placing multiple sulfate groups and various polyamines
on a different steroid scaffold. Many of the squalamine analogues
showed prominent antibacterial activity comparable to that of the
parent compound squalamine.16 To mimic
the antimicrobial activity of squalamine and cationic antimicrobial
peptides, Savage designed novel cholic acid-based cationic steroid
antibiotics (CSA) such as ceragenin 3 (Figure 1).17 Cholic acid having hydrophobic steroid skeleton and presence of
three hydroxyl groups at C3, C7, and C12 positions along with a carboxylic
acid functionality at the C24 position was selected because of its
inherent amphipathic nature, which was altered by incorporating multiple
amino functionalities.18 Conjugates of
cholic acid with different bioactive compounds are known to act against
a plethora of microbes.19−24 Bile acid-based peptide conjugates such as 4–6 are also gaining considerable importance as antimicrobial
agents because these structures provide ample opportunity to alter
the amphiphilicity by varying amino acid residues.22,25−27

Figure 1 Cationic steroid antibiotics.

In the present investigation, we synthesized novel cholic acid–lysine
based conjugates as cationic amphiphiles. The amphiphilicity of the
molecules and the overall charge was fine-tuned by coupling mono-,
di-, tri-, and tetra-lysine units at the C3 β-position of the
cholic acid scaffold. A total of 16 cholic acid–lysine conjugates
were synthesized and tested for their antimicrobial activity against
representative Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and Candida spp. The lead compounds were further evaluated against
drug-resistant clinical isolates, and their interaction with a range
of known antimicrobial drugs was also determined. Membrane permeabilization
studies were carried out to know the possible mechanism of action
by these compounds. Cytotoxicity as well as hemolytic activity of
the lead compounds was also evaluated to understand the selective
toxicity of the compounds against the microorganisms. The biological
assays validated the importance of the free amino group at the ε-position
of lysine and 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-protecting group at
the α-amino group of lysine for the antimicrobial activity.

Result
and Discussion
Based on the antimicrobial properties of cationic
steroid antibiotics,
we planned to introduce lysine residues to the cholic acid scaffold
to obtain a library of facially amphiphilic cationic steroid antibiotics.
To achieve the synthesis of the desired cholic acid–lysine
conjugates, amino functionality was introduced on the cholic acid
scaffold by converting the 3α-hydroxyl group of cholic acid
to the 3β-amino group in four steps using the previously reported
procedure25 with the exception that the
intermediate azido functionality was reduced to an amino group via
the Staudinger reaction.28 Commercially
available Fmoc–Lys(Boc)–OH was coupled to C3 β-amino
functionality of intermediate 7 in DMF via solution-phase
peptide coupling protocol using EDCI, HOBt as a coupling reagent,
and triethylamine as a base to synthesize fully protected cholic acid–monolysine
conjugate 8 (Scheme 1). Selective deprotection of Fmoc at the α-position
of lysine was achieved by 20% piperidine in DMF to yield intermediate 9, which on further deprotection of the tert-butyloxycarbonyl protecting group (Boc) at the ε-position
using HCl/dioxane resulted in the formation of the desired cholic
acid–lysine conjugate 10.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Monolysine-Derived
Cholic Acid Conjugates
(a) Fmoc–Lys(Boc)–OH,
DMF, EDCI, HOBt, Et3N, 25 °C, 6 h; (b) 20% piperidine
in DMF, 30 min; and (c) HCl in dioxane, 30 min.

The synthesized conjugate 10 was screened for antimicrobial
activity against bacterial strains viz. S. aureus (Gram-positive bacterium), E. coli (Gram-negative bacterium) and fungal strain Candida
albicans by the disk diffusion method. The monolysine
conjugate 10 was found to be inactive against bacteria
and C. albicans when tested at a concentration
of 30 μg, whereas a slight but insignificant activity was observed
against S. aureus and E. coli at 100 μg concentration (Table S1) with a zone of inhibition (ZOI) of
7 mm. Amongst the intermediates (7–9), only the Boc-protected cholic acid–lysine conjugate 9 showed antibacterial activity against S.
aureus at a 30 μg concentration with a ZOI of
9 mm. It exhibited an improved effect against S. aureus, but alike conjugate 10, compound 9 inhibited E. coli at a higher concentration (100 μg)
(Table S1).

Having observed a moderate
activity of the intermediate 9, another cholic acid–lysine
intermediate 11 with
Fmoc functionality was prepared from compound 8 by selective
deprotection of the Boc group at the ε-position using HCl in
dioxane. Interestingly, compound 11 retained the activity
against S. aureus with the ZOI of 8
mm at a 30 μg concentration, albeit to a lesser extent than
the intermediate 9, and was inactive against E. coli. (Table S1). None
of these compounds demonstrated any inhibitory effect against C. albicans up to 100 μg by the disk diffusion
method. Thus, incorporation of one lysine moiety to a C3-β amino-functionalized
cholic acid scaffold resulted in compounds with moderate antimicrobial
activity, which prompted us to synthesize additional cholic acid–lysine-based
cationic amphiphiles. Accordingly, the intermediate 9 was coupled with Fmoc–Lys(Boc)–OH to yield a fully
protected dipeptide 12 (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Dilysine-Derived
Cholic Acid Conjugates
(a) Fmoc–Lys(Boc)–OH,
DMF, EDCI, HOBt, Et3N, 25 °C, 6 h; (b) HCl in dioxane,
30 min; (c) 20% piperidine in DMF, 30 min.

The selective as well as complete deprotection of N-ε-Boc and N-α-Fmoc functionalities
of the dilysine conjugate as described earlier furnished the compounds 13, 14, and 15 (Scheme 2). Compound 15, alike compound 10, displayed marginal antibacterial
activity against S. aureus with a ZOI
of 8 mm at a 100 μg concentration (Table S1). Whereas, compound 14 was observed to be inactive,
unlike compound 9. The N-α-Fmoc-protected
dilysine cholic acid conjugate 13 exhibited improved
antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. coli with a ZOI of 9 mm at
a 30 μg concentration as compared to the monolysine derivative 11 and was also found to be active against C. albicans with a ZOI of 7 mm at a 30 μg concentration
(Table S1). Thus, the introduction of one
more lysine moiety resulted in the enhancement of antimicrobial activity.
The observed Structure–Activity Relationship (SAR) was further
extended by coupling another Fmoc–Lys(Boc)–OH to furnish
the fully protected trilysine conjugate 16, which on
further selective and global deprotection of amino protecting groups
yielded compounds 17, 18, and 19 (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Synthesis
of Trilysine-Derived Cholic Acid Conjugates
(a) Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH, DMF,
EDCI, HOBt, Et3N, 25 °C, 6 h; (b) HCl in dioxane,
30 min; (c) 20% piperidine in DMF, 30 min.

In accordance with the previous data obtained for dilysine cholic
acid conjugates, compounds 16, 18, and 19 did not display any promising activity against the bacterial
and fungal strains tested. On the other hand, the Fmoc-bearing conjugate 17 displayed significant antimicrobial activity, similar to
compound 13 (Table S1) with
ZOIs of 9, 10, and 7 mm against S. aureus, E. coli, and C. albicans, respectively, at a 30 μg concentration. Therefore, to our
curiosity and to further extend the SAR studies, the addition of one
more lysine moiety was planned and executed, which furnished fully
protected tetralysine conjugate 20 as well as the related N-α-Fmoc and N-ε-Boc derivatives 21, 22, and the desired cholic acid tetralysine
conjugate 23 (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Synthesis of Tetralysine-Derived Cholic Acid Conjugates
(a) Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH, DMF,
EDCI, HOBt, Et3N, 25 °C, 6 h; (b) HCl in dioxane,
30 min; (c) 20% piperidine in DMF, 30 min.

Amphiphilic tetralysine cholic acid derivatives 20 and 22 similar to dilysine and trilysine conjugates
were found to be devoid of any antimicrobial activity. The tetralysine
conjugate 23 exhibited subtle antimicrobial activity
only against S. aureus at a higher
concentration tested (ZOI of 10 mm at 100 μg; Table S1). As expected, the Fmoc-bearing tetralysine conjugate 21 demonstrated antibacterial activity similar to dilysine
and trilysine conjugates 13 and 17, respectively,
with a ZOI of 9 mm at a 30 μg concentration, but the antifungal
activity of compound 21 was diminished (Table S1).

Based on
the preliminary results
obtained with the disk diffusion assay, compounds 9 (against S. aureus only), 13, 17, and 21 were selected as the lead active compounds.
Measuring a zone of inhibition using the disk diffusion assay is often
employed as a useful preliminary method to identify active compounds.
The magnitude of the zone obtained in the disc diffusion assay depends
upon many variables, including the solubility and rate of diffusion
of the tested compounds through agar. To confirm the preliminary results,
the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the compounds 9 (against S. aureus only), 13, 17, and 21 were then evaluated
using the broth dilution method (Table 1).

Among the selected derivatives, the Fmoc-bearing cholic
acid–lysine
conjugates 13 and 17 were observed to be
the promising broad-spectrum antimicrobials with MIC values of 4,
2, and 8 μg/mL against S. aureus, E. coli, and C. albicans, respectively. The scanning electron micrographs of E. coli ATCC 25922 treated with 2 μg/mL of
compound 13 demonstrated morphological alterations, including
membrane blebbing, loss of cell architecture, alterations in cell
size, and cellular damage in the treated cells compared with the untreated
controls (Figure 2).

25,000 ×; (B–D) cells treated with compound 13 at magnifications of 15,000, 25,000, and 30,000 ×, respectively.

Exposure to the MIC levels of 13 and 17 was found to cause a considerable amount of cell lysis
in S. aureus, E. coli, and C. albicans, as determined by
the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase assay. Significantly greater
levels of this intracellular enzyme were detected in the extracellular
milieu of the treated samples compared with the untreated controls
(p < 0.05; Table 2). Membrane permeability studies using the hydrophobic
probe N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (NPN) further demonstrated
the ability of these compounds to induce membrane damage. NPN is generally
excluded from the cells with intact outer membranes. However, once
the outer membrane integrity is disturbed, it can penetrate and exhibit
fluorescence upon interaction with the phospholipid microenvironment.
Treatment of E. coli ATCC 25922 with 13 and 17 led to a substantial increase in the
fluorescence of NPN. The average NPN fluorescence in the treated samples
relative to that in untreated controls was 2704.78 ± 293.37 and
6900.05 ± 579.94 AU for 13 and 17, respectively.

Many antimicrobial
peptides especially containing Fmoc-moiety are
known to self-assemble into supramolecular architectures, which in
turn are reported to be responsible for their antimicrobial properties.29 In the present investigation, the results also
specifically highlight the critical role of N-α-Fmoc
functionality at the N-terminal of the cholic acid–lysine-based
peptide conjugates. Overall, the observed activity can be attributed
to the altered hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance, overall amphiphilicity,
and/or possible self-assembly structures of the conjugates prepared
by the attachment of 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl functionality to a
cholic acid scaffold via lysine linkage. The presence of a positively
charged ε-amino group was also observed to be equally important
for the observed activity as the increase in the number of amino acid
residues with primary amine functionalities resulted in the improvement
of the activity.

We further evaluated the synergistic effect
of these compounds,
if any, with the known antimicrobial drugs. In this context, a range
of antibacterial agents belonging to different classes (cefotaxime,
amikacin, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin) were tested in combination
with compounds 13 and 17 by fractional inhibitory
concentration assays. The interaction was, however, found to be indifferent
(∑FIC = 1.01), and the MICs of antibiotics in combination with
compounds were the same as those obtained with antibiotics alone against S. aureus and E. coli. In contrast, a combination of these compounds with antifungal drugs
demonstrated a substantially improved efficacy against C. albicans compared with the drugs or the compounds
alone. A synergistic effect was noted with the polyene antifungal
agent amphotericin B, and the ∑FICs were 0.12 and 0.25 with
compounds 13 and 17, respectively. These
compounds also displayed an additive effect with the triazole drug
voriconazole (∑FICs = 0.75 and 0.63, respectively). This may
be attributed to the fact that the synthesized cholic acid–lysine
conjugates and the antifungal drugs tested target the same cellular
site, that is, the cell membrane. While amphotericin B binds to the
membrane ergosterol and leads to the formation of pores along with
leakage of the intracellular content, voriconazole blocks ergosterol
biosynthesis by inhibiting the enzyme lanosterol 14α-demethylase.30 The synthesized cholic acid–lysine conjugates
are likely to act on the microbial cell membrane, possibly via the
carpet model.31

The in-vitro cell
viability assay of the selected synthesized compounds
was carried out using the MTT reduction assay.32 Raw 264.7 murine
macrophages, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293), and lung adenocarcinoma
A549 cell cultures were used for cell viability assay. It is evident
from Figure 3 that
most of the synthesized compound did not show any considerable cytotoxicity
against any of the cell lines that were tested, and cells were significantly
viable even after 24 h treatment with different test compounds. As
shown in Figure 3A,
for Raw 264.7 murine macrophages, compounds 9 and 14 were found to be slightly toxic at a higher concentration
(200 μM) with ∼30 and 32% decrease in cell viability,
respectively, in which more than 90% of the cell were viable at the
lowest concentration (5 μM) for both the compounds. For HEK293
cells (Figure 3B),
only compounds 9 and 11 were found to be
toxic at a higher concentration (200 μM) with ∼32 and
28% decrease in cell viability, respectively, whereas almost 92% of
the cells were viable at the lowest concentration (5 μM) tested
for both compounds 9 and 11. Interestingly,
out of the three cell lines used, the test compounds were least toxic
to lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells (Figure 3C). Compounds 14 and 22 were slightly toxic at a higher concentration (200 μM) and
caused ∼28 and 24% decrease in cell viability, respectively.
More than 92% of lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells were viable at the
lowest concentration (5 μM) tested for both the compounds.

293), (C) lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells with different concentrations
of test compounds and untreated cells as the positive control, and
(D) hemolytic assay results for the test compounds.

The hemolytic activity of test compounds at the 100 and 200
μM
concentrations was evaluated where Triton X-100 (1% v/v) and PBS were
used as positive and negative controls, respectively (Figure 3D). The hemolytic assay is
another good method for cytotoxicity evaluation of test compounds,
which is characterized by erythrocyte rupture with the release of
hemoglobin. The biocompatibility of therapeutic compounds is of utmost
importance during drug discovery and development. The compounds with
% hemolysis less than 10 are considered to be nonhemolytic while the
ones with % hemolysis more than 25 are assumed to be toxic.33 In the current study, compounds 9 and 14 were found to be hemolytic at both tested concentrations
(Figure 3D), whereas
the compound 18 showed 7.2 and 13.7% hemolysis at 100
and 200 μM, respectively. Interestingly, the monolysine (9), dilysine (14), and trilysine (18) conjugates of cholic acid with N-ε-Boc functionalities
and the free α-amino group at the N-terminal
demonstrated hemolytic activities. All the other compounds including
the active lead compounds 13 and 17 showed
less than 10% hemolysis at a very high concentration of 200 μM,
confirming the selective toxicity of these lead compounds against
the deadly microorganisms.

Very recently, we observed a selective
antibacterial activity of
dimeric cholic acid-based amphiphiles linked via amino or polyamino
functionalities,20 whereas the present
investigation demonstrated a broad-spectrum selective antimicrobial
activity of the cholic acid derivatives linked with fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl
moiety via dilysine and trilysine linkers. Although the preliminary
membrane permeability studies demonstrated the ability of these compounds
to induce cell lysis and membrane damage in the microbes, further
mechanistic investigations are needed to confirm the exact mechanism
of action of these compounds.

Conclusions
A library of cholic
acid–lysine-based cationic amphiphiles
was designed and synthesized. Among all the synthesized compounds,
two compounds 13 and 17 where cholic acid
is linked to fluorenyl-9-methoxycarbonyl moiety by the lysine linker
displayed broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, E. coli, and C. albicans with MIC values
of 4, 2, and 8 μg/mL, respectively. The lead compounds 13 and 17 were active against resistant strains
of S. aureus, E. coli, and C. auris as well. A synergistic
and additive effect was also exhibited by these two compounds with
a polyene antifungal Amphotericin B and triazole drug voriconazole,
respectively. The selective toxicity of the compounds against the
microorganisms was also determined using the cell viability assay
(using Raw 264.7 murine macrophages, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK
293), and lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells) as well as the hemolytic
assay. Our results thus demonstrate the therapeutic potential of these
cationic amphiphiles for use either alone or in combination with the
currently available antimicrobial agents against infections caused
by multidrug-resistant microbes. A considerable amount of cell lysis
by the lead compounds at MIC determined by the glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase assay in addition to the membrane permeability studies
using the hydrophobic probe N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine
(NPN) further demonstrated the ability of these compounds to induce
membrane damage. Their precise mechanism of action and structural
requirements for the biological activity are under further investigation.

Experimental
Section
General Procedure
Routine solvents, EDCI, HOBt, Et3N were purchased from commercial suppliers. L-amino acid i.e. Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH, cholic acid and HPLC solvents
(water and acetonitrile) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. The bulk
solvents such as ethylacetate, DCM, and MeOH were distilled before
use. The organic solvents were dried wherever necessary. HCl/dioxane
was obtained by passing HCl gas in dioxane for 2 h. The reactions
were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere. All the reactions were
monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) carried out on Merck
silica gel aluminum sheets and visualized under UV light and with
different stains such as ethanolic solutions of phosphomolybdic acid
and ninhydrin. Column chromatography was carried out using a 230–400
mesh silica gel or neutral alumina as per the requirement. 1H and 13C NMR of samples were recorded on a Bruker 300
MHz, Bruker Advance II 400 MHz, JEOL JNM ECS400, or JEOL 500 MHz spectrometer
with DMSO-d6 and CDCl3 as solvents
and TMS as the internal standard. The splitting patterns in 1H NMR are designated as s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; m, multiplet.
The chemical shift values are reported in units of δ. The mass spectra were recorded on a Waters Q-TOF or Thermo
LTQ-XL mass spectrometer. HPLC analysis was performed on a Waters
HPLC system attached to a waters 515 HPLC pump linked with a Waters
2996 photodiode array detector-equipped C18 column, 4.6 × 250
mm (5 μm) with UV detection at 254 nm. An HPLC gradient 25 minute-run
program was set using the solvents water (Solvent A) and acetonitrile
(Solvent B) at 25 °C at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.

To a solution of cholic acid derivative 7 (500 mg, 1.2 mmol) in dry DMF (10 mL), Fmoc–Lys(Boc)–OH
(500 mg, 1.1 mmol), HOBt (80 mg, 0.6 mmol), and triethylamine (335
μL, 2.4 mmol) were added at 0 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere.
After 10 min of stirring at 0 °C, EDCI (455 mg, 2.4 mmol) was
added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was allowed to
warm to room temperature and stirred for 6 h. Completion of the reaction
was monitored by TLC. After completion of the reaction, the solvent
was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in 50
mL of ethylacetate, further washed with water and aqueous sodium chloride,
and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent was removed under vacuum
and the residue was purified by flash column chromatography using
230–400 mesh silica gel using MeOH/DCM as eluents to obtain
compound 8 (755 mg, 73% yield) as an amorphous white
solid. mp: 120–123 °C; 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.76 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 2H), 7.57–7.60

Microbial Strains
One representative standard strain
each belonging to Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus ATCC 29213), Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli ATCC 25922), and Candida species (C. albicans ATCC 90028) was employed for screening
the antimicrobial activity of the test compounds. S.
aureus 1704, E. coli 4052, and C. auris AHD62 from our
laboratory collection were taken as drug-resistant isolates. S. aureus 1704 is a methicillin-resistant isolate,
which is also resistant to ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol. E. coli 4052 is resistant to cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin. C. auris AHD62 is resistant to fluconazole and amphotericin
B according to the current susceptibility recommendations of Center
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), U.S.

Determination of Antimicrobial
Activity
The antimicrobial
activity of the test compounds was first evaluated by the disk diffusion
assay at a concentration of 30 and 100 μg/disk according to
the guidelines of the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
using Mueller Hinton agar (MHA) for bacterial strains and MHA with
2% glucose and 0.5 μg methylene blue/mL for Candida species.20,34,35 The MICs of the lead compounds was then determined by the broth
microdilution assay. For the antibacterial assay, two-fold dilution
series of the compounds were tested against 5 × 105 bacterial cfu/mL in Mueller Hinton broth (MHB) such that the final
solvent (DMSO) concentration was 1%, and the microtiter plates were
incubated for 18 h at 37 °C.20 For
the antifungal assay, 0.5–2.5 × 103Candida cells/mL were exposed to the test compounds in RPMI-1640
for 24 h at 37 °C as per the CLSI guidelines.36 Untreated control, sterility control, solvent control,
and positive control (amikacin or amphotericin B) were set up in parallel.
MIC was defined as the lowest concentration that resulted in complete
inhibition of microbial growth.

Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase
Assay
The intracellular
enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a marker to determine
microbial cell lysis37 after exposure to
the test compounds. Briefly, the bacterial or fungal strains were
treated with the test compounds at MIC according to the broth antimicrobial
assay described above, and 40 μL of the treated samples were
incubated in a 250 mM glycine buffer (pH 7.4) containing 60 mM glucose
6-phosphate, 20 mM NADP, and 300 mM MgCl2 in a reaction
volume of 1.2 mL for 5 min at 25 °C. Untreated controls were
set up in parallel. The production of NADPH was monitored as the change
in absorbance at 340 nm. One enzyme unit (U) was
defined as the enzyme activity catalyzing the formation of 1 mmol
NADPH per min.

NPN Permeability Assay
E. coli ATCC 25922 was exposed to the test compounds
at MIC for 4 h according
to the broth antimicrobial assay described above. Thereafter, the
cells were harvested by centrifugation, followed by addition of NPN
at a final concentration of 10 μM.38 The fluorescence was measured using an excitation and emission wavelength
of 340 and 420 nm, respectively, and expressed as AU per unit OD in
the treated samples relative to the untreated controls.

Synergism Testing
The interaction of lead compounds
with known antimicrobial agents was evaluated by FIC testing.20 Cefotaxime, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin
vancomycin (for S. aureus only) belonging
to β-lactam, aminoglycoside, fluoroquinolone, and glycopeptide
classes were used as the antibacterial drugs. Amphotericin B and voriconazole
from the polyene and triazole groups were employed as the antifungal
agents. Broth microdilution assays containing two-fold grading concentrations
of the test compounds, either alone or in combination with the antimicrobial
drugs, were performed, and the FIC indices were calculated. ∑FIC
of ≤0.5, >0.5 and ≤1, >1, and ≤4, and >4
were
defined as synergism, additiveness, indifference, and antagonism,
respectively.

Cell Viability Studies
The cytotoxicity
studies of
synthesized compounds were carried out using three different cell
lines. Raw 264.7 murine macrophages cells were grown as a monolayer
in DMEM high glucose media supplemented with sodium bicarbonate, l-glutamine, 10% FBS, and 1% pen-strap. The culture condition
was maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a CO2 incubator. Raw 264.7 murine macrophages cells having 90% confluency
with passage number 32 were used for in vitro cell viability experiment.
Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells were grown as a monolayer
in DMEM high-glucose media supplemented with sodium bicarbonate, sodium
pyruvate, l-glutamine, 10% FBS, and 1% pen-strap. The culture
condition was maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a
CO2 incubator. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells
having 90% confluency with passage number 38 were used for in vitro
cell viability experiment. Lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells were grown
in an RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Pen-strep.
The culture condition was maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a CO2 incubator. Cells having 90% confluency
with passage number 35 were used for in vitro cell viability experiment.

The in vitro cell viability study was performed using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide) reduction assay. For the assay, Raw 264.7 murine macrophages
were scrapped with the help of a sterile scrapper, HEK293 and A549
cells were trypsinized, and all three types of cells were seeded separately
in a 96-well plate at a cell density of 1–1.5 × 104 cells/well in 100 μL in their respective complete media.
The MTT reduction assay was carried out in triplicate for all concentrations
of test compounds. After 24 h incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a CO2 incubator, cells were then treated with
test compounds at varying concentrations (5, 10, 50, 100, and 200
μM) in complete media and incubated for 24 h. After 24 h, to
the treatment mixture, 10 μL of MTT reagent (5 mg/mL) was added
in each well and again incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The absorbance
was recorded at 590 nm after 4 h using a microplate reader. The untreated
cells were taken as control with 100% viability that was used to compare
the relative cell viability in the test wells.

Hemolytic Assay
Hemolytic activity of synthesized compounds
was studied according to the literature methods.33,39 The method employed was slightly modified. Freshly obtained 3 mL
blood from healthy rat was collected in vacutainer heparin tubes.
The blood was centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min, the separated plasma
was discarded, and cells were washed three times with sterile isotonic
phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.4). The washed RBCs were resuspended
in PBS and constant volume of 200 μL of suspended RBCs was used
for the hemolytic assay. Each test compound was mixed separately with
washed RBC at concentrations of 100 and 200 μM, respectively.
The samples were incubated immediately after mixing for 30 min at
37 °C with intermittent shaking. After incubation, the samples
were centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected
from each test mix into a 96-well plate. Triton X-100 (1% v/v) and
PBS were used as positive control and negative control, respectively.
The absorbance was measured at 540 nM using a microplate reader. The
assay was repeated twice, and each time, it was performed in duplicate.
The hemolysis for each sample was calculated using this formula: %Hemolysis
= (AS/AC)
× 100 where AS is the absorbance
of the sample and AC is the absorbance
of the control.
