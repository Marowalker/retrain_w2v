Graphite-related
materials play an important role in various kinds
of devices and catalysts. Controlling the properties of such materials
is of great significance to widen the potential applications and improve
the performance of such applications as field emission devices and
catalyst for fuel cells. In particular, the work function strongly
affects the performance, and thus development of methods to tune the
work function widely is urgently required. Here, we achieved wide-range
control of the work function of graphite by nitrogen and hydrogen
plasma treatments. The time of hydrogen plasma treatment and the amount
of nitrogen atoms doped beforehand could control the work function
of graphite from 2.9 to 5.0 eV. The formation of a surface dipole
layer and the nitrogen-derived electron donation contributed to such
lowering of the work function, which is advantageous for applications
in various fields.

Introduction
Two-dimensional materials
consisting of sp2 carbon atoms
(e.g., graphite, graphene, and graphene oxide) have been considered
as promising materials for various applications such as transparent
electrodes1,2 and field emission devices.3,4 Engineering of the structural and electronic properties of graphite
sheets is essential for these applications, and then controlling the
work function of these materials has a great significance. In the
application for the electrodes of electronic devices, tuning the work
function of graphite is a key issue because the alignment of electronic
levels at the interface would dominate the device performance.5−9 In the field emission devices, on the other hand, lowering the work
function of graphite would lead to the field emitter of high efficiency.
Furthermore, the graphite sheets doped with hetero-atoms show excellent
catalytic activity10,11 with the change of work function.12

To tune the graphite work function, various
methods have been reported:
doping of heteroatoms,13,14 introduction of functional groups,7,15,16 and so forth. The resulting change
of work function was, however, small and the downward shift was especially
difficult. A typical surface science method to decrease the work function
of materials is usually done by depositing alkali metal atoms on the
surface. In the previous reports on graphite materials, a dipole layer
was formed with Cs and O atoms on the graphene surface, which decreased
the work function to 3.4 eV by solution process17 and to 1.3 eV by vacuum evaporation.18 Although the latter method drastically decreased the work
function, the surface was unstable in the atmosphere. Another way
to decrease the work function of carbon-based materials is by hydrogenation
of the surface. Actually, the hydrogenation of graphite decreased
the work function to 4.0 eV,19,20 and that of diamond
decreased the work function to 3.5 eV, leading to a negative electron
affinity surface.21 However, the application
of diamond is limited because of its low conductivity. Therefore,
developing conductive materials with a low work function is required.

In the present work, we have investigated an effective surface
treatment for decreasing the work function of graphite sheets by exposing
a well-defined highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) to radio-frequency
(rf) hydrogen and nitrogen plasma. We found that hydrogenation decreased
the work function of HOPG to 3.7 eV owing to the formation of a surface
dipole layer, and nitrogen doping preceding the hydrogenation further
decreased the work function to 2.9 eV. The analysis by electron spectroscopies
indicated that the electron donation from nitrogen atoms assisted
the decrease of the work function of graphite in addition to the formation
of the surface dipole layer.

Results and Discussion
First, we
investigated the effect of plasma treatment on the work
function of HOPG. Figure 1 summarizes the valence band spectra of the HOPG samples treated
by various kinds of plasma treatments: N2 plasma for 30
min (N plasma), H2 plasma for 40 min (H plasma), and N2 plasma for 30 min before H2 plasma for 5 min (N–H
plasma). The intensity rises steeply at the cutoff energy, from which
the work function was evaluated. The cutoff energy moved upward from
that of pristine HOPG (p-HOPG) after N plasma treatment, whereas it
moved downward after H plasma and N–H plasma treatments. The
σ peak around the binding energy of 13.7 eV22 in p-HOPG weakened after plasma treatment, reflecting the
disorder induced in the honeycomb lattice. The values of work function
after each plasma treatment are shown in the figure: 4.5 eV for p-HOPG,
which is well consistent with previous reports,14,18,20 5.0 eV for N plasma, 3.7 eV for H plasma,
and 2.9 eV for N–H plasma. The work function increased after
N plasma treatment, whereas it decreased after H plasma and N–H
plasma treatments. We carried out several experiments to elucidate
what the origin of the difference is.

Figure 1 UPS spectra of pristine and plasma-treated
HOPG samples. Figures
denote the work function evaluated from the cutoff energies in the
spectra.

Figure 2 shows the
change of the work functions with H plasma treatment time for the
p-HOPG and N-doped HOPG samples. The work function of p-HOPG decreased
gradually and reached the value of 3.7 eV after 40 min treatment.
This work function is much lower than that of Al (4.2 eV) which is
commonly used for the electrodes in the devices of n-type organic
semiconductors.2,6,23 This
decrease could be explained in terms of the surface dipole layer induced
by the formation of the C–H bond.15,21 The charge transfer from the H atom to the C atom, originating from
the difference in electronegativity, would form the dipole layer on
the HOPG surface. Such a kind of dipole layer was observed in hydrogen-terminated
diamond, in which the dipole layer made the work function decrease
by 1.5 eV at maximum.21

Figure 2 Change of the work function
of pristine (black) and N-doped (red)
HOPG samples as a function of H plasma treatment time.

To confirm the formation of the C–H bond in H plasma-treated
HOPG, we conducted Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). A larger Raman D peak was observed in H-HOPG than in HOPG with
other kinds of treatments (Figures S1 and S2). Possible defect types in plasma-treated HOPG are vacancy, N doping,
and sp3 bonding in hydrogenated carbon. Among them, sp3 bonding is considered to cause the largest D peak.24,25 The strongest D peak in H-HOPG, therefore, suggests the formation
of sp3 C–H bond by H plasma treatment.

As
shown in Figure 2,
the work function of p-HOPG reached a steady value after 40 min
treatment, the reason for which could be attributed to the competing
phenomena as described in the following. First, H atoms are bonded
to part of the carbon atoms and the formed sp3 bond.26 The difference in the lattice constant between
the sp3 and sp2 bonds caused stress in the graphite
lattice and suppressed further hydrogenation (Figure S3). Second, sputtering from continuous plasma treatment
introduced vacancies in the graphite lattice,27 which relaxed the stress and enhanced further hydrogenation.26 Third, hydrogenated C atoms are themselves removed
by the continuous H plasma treatment.25,28 Then, hydrogenation
and dehydrogenation came in equilibrium, and the work function saturated
after as long as 40 min of treatment.

The change in work function
for the N-doped HOPG is quite drastic
as shown by the red line of Figure 2. The N-HOPG, which was prepared by 30 min of N2 plasma treatment, has a work function of 5.0 eV at the initial
stage (Figure 1). The
origin of this increase can be ascribed to the charge transfer from
C to N, which will be explained later. This upward-shifted work function
of N-HOPG, however, decreased rapidly with H plasma treatment and
reached 2.9 eV after 5 min of treatment. This value is much lower
than that of hydrogen-terminated diamond and is rather close to that
of Ca (2.9 eV). Further treatment gradually reincreased its work function
because the doped nitrogen atoms were desorbed by H plasma treatment.

Although the N-doped HOPG itself has a larger work function than
the p-HOPG, H plasma treatment changed its work function much lower
than that of the p-HOPG. To elucidate this mechanism, the samples
were characterized by XPS at each stage of plasma treatment. Figure 3a shows the N 1s
spectra of N-HOPG before and after H plasma treatment. The N 1s peak
consists of several components, reflecting the different chemical
states. The peak was fitted with graphitic N (the binding energy of
401.4 eV), pyrrolic N (399.7 eV), and pyridinic N (398.5 eV). The
sites of N atoms are schematically depicted in Figure 3b. According to the previous results,13,14,29 the graphitic N donates the electron
to the surrounding graphene lattice, leading to the decrease of the
work function. The pyridinic N, on the other hand, increases the work
function owing to the reverse electron transfer at the C–N
bond.30 Before the H plasma treatment,
most of the N atoms were at the pyridinic and pyrrolic sites, which
increased the work function from 4.5 eV (p-HOPG) to 5.0 eV. After
the H plasma treatment, the nitrogen content decreased from 13.9 to
6.7 at. % by sputtering. It is striking that the pyridinic N completely
disappeared, whereas the graphitic N and the pyrrolic N seemed to
remain. Since the pyridinic N and pyrrolic N reside commonly at the
edge of graphene sheets, it seems strange that only the pyridinic
N was eliminated by sputtering.

Figure 3 (a) Nitrogen 1s XPS spectra of the N-HOPG
sample before and after
H plasma treatment. (b) Typical doping sites of nitrogen and hydrogen
atoms in the graphene lattice.

We consider that the peak observed around 400 eV after the H plasma
treatment originated not from the pyrrolic N but from the pyridinium
N (Figure 3b). The
pyridinium N was formed by protonation of pyridinic N, the binding
energy of which was calculated to be 398.93 eV by Hou et al.31 Nguyen and Turecek investigated the protonation
of pyridine molecules.32 They reported
that the proton affinity to the N site of pyridine is 924 kJ/mol,
which is larger than that to the C sites of pyridine (637–684
kJ/mol). Thus, it is plausible that the H plasma treatment sputtered
part of pyridinic N and simultaneously converted the remaining pyridinic
N into pyridinium N. To demonstrate this idea, we repeated the hydrogenation
and dehydrogenation treatments for N-doped HOPG (Figure S4), which initially contained only graphitic N and
pyridinic N components. In this experiment, H plasma clearly changes
the pyridinic N to pyridinium N, and subsequent thermal annealing
returned the pyridinium N to pyridinic N.

Here, we will discuss
the desorption process of surface elements
in graphite during plasma and thermal treatments. Desorbed elements
by plasma and annealing processes are not only H atoms. Part of hydrogenated
C and N atoms desorbed with H atoms in the dehydrogenation process.
During the annealing of hydrogenated graphite, C atoms are desorbed
with H atoms, and vacancy defects are left in the graphite surface
layer (Figure S5). Similarly, the peripheral
hydrogenated nitrogen such as pyridinium N seems to be also decreased
by the sputtering and chemical desorption effects. Using this process,
we can enhance the ratio of graphitic N/total N up to 86% (Figure S6), which is a much higher component
ratio than the previous result.13 This
result shows that H plasma etching effectively removes the edge dopants
and tunes the doping sites. Schiros et al. pointed out that pyridinium
N slightly donates electrons to the graphene lattice in contrast to
pyridinic N.14 In spite of the very small
n-doping from pyridinium N, the H plasma treatment converted the pyridinic
impurities, which increase the work function, to the ones which donate
electrons to the graphene lattice and causes decrease of the work
function. Formation of a surface dipole layer together with electron
donation in N-HOPG contributed to the larger decrease of work function
than p-HOPG, for which a surface dipole layer mainly contributed to
the decrease of work function. After H plasma treatment for various
samples (Figure S7), the sample having
the largest amount of doped nitrogen atoms showed the lowest work
function since all kinds of dopants finally contribute to the decrease
in the work function.

H plasma treatment to N-HOPG was found
to achieve the work function
as low as 2.9 eV, which is comparable to that of Ca. Generally, the
surface with a low work function is unstable under atmospheric condition.
To evaluate the stability, the present sample was exposed to atmosphere
for 3 h. Figure 4a
shows the change of work function at each stage of process. The initial
work function of 2.9 eV moved to 3.9 eV after exposure to air for
3 h [Figure 4a(i,ii)].
It recovered to 3.5 eV by 1 h annealing at 130 °C in vacuum [Figure 4a(iii)]. It should
be mentioned that the work function of N–H HOPG could be decreased
as low as that of hydrogen-terminated diamond by reannealing even
after exposure to air. Further annealing at 250 and 600 °C, however,
reincreased the work function to 3.7 and 4.1 eV [Figure 4a(iv,v)]. The surface atomic
composition at each stage of process was investigated by XPS, the
result of which is summarized in Figure 4b. After the exposure in air for 3 h, the
oxygen content increased to 1.6 at. % owing to the adsorption of water
and oxygen molecules. The electron-withdrawing characteristics of
these molecules were likely to move the Fermi level of the sample
downward, and the work function of hydrogenated N-HOPG increased to
3.9 eV as shown in Figure 4a. Annealing at 130 °C for 1 h decreased the oxygen content
to 0.9 at. %, and its work function recovered to 3.5 eV. With the
annealing temperatures above 250 °C, not only the oxygen content
but also the nitrogen content decreased remarkably. After annealing
at 600 °C, the oxygen and nitrogen contents were decreased to
0.1 and 0.6 at. %, respectively. Elias et al. reported that hydrogen
atoms desorb from hydrogenated graphene (graphane) at 350 °C
in vacuum.26 Thus, annealing above 250
°C caused this desorption of nitrogen and hydrogen atoms and
increased the work function.

at 600 °C for 1 h. (b) Nitrogen and oxygen contents at each stage

Finally, we would like to mention
the advantages of present results.
In the field of controlling the work function with hydrogenation,
there are many reports about diamond materials. The hydrogen-terminated
diamond decreased its work function from 5.0 to 3.9 eV and showed
superior field emission characteristics. On the other hand, there
are also reports that conductivity of diamond was improved by hetero-doping,
and the work function of nitrogen-doped diamond was reduced to 3.1
eV by hydrogenation.33 Even if improved
by doping, the conductivity of diamond is inferior to that of graphene
and graphite. By using graphite materials, we obtained a low work
function material which is superior to diamond in electronic conductivity.
In the view point of the surface modification method, rf plasma treatment
to tune the electronic state of the graphite lattice has advantages
over conventional doping methods such as chemical vapor deposition
or heat treatment in the atmosphere of dopant sources.30,34 First, the doping process could be done at lower temperatures (room
temperature in the present work) under the atmosphere of easy-handling
gases (nitrogen or hydrogen). Second, the doping amount of nitrogen
could be tuned precisely over the wide range from subpercent to 32
at. % (Figure S7). These advantages would
be helpful for the practical application of plasma to graphite-based
materials.

Conclusions
In summary, we found that the combination
of N-doping and hydrogenation
remarkably decreases the work function of graphite. The 30 min N2 plasma and 5–10 min H2 plasma treatment
achieved a work function as low as 2.9 eV, which is much lower than
that of hydrogen-terminated diamond. This was realized by the formation
of a surface dipole layer and the electron donation to the graphite
lattice. This surface state of the modified HOPG was rather stable
in ambient air, and the work function recovered to 3.5 eV even after
exposure to air for 3 h. The hydrogenated graphite sheets doped with
a considerable amount of nitrogen would be applied to the electrode
material substituting for Ca, Al, and diamond. The effect of nitrogen
doping into the graphene lattice has also attracted much attention
for application to the catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction,10 photocatalyst of g-C3N4 for water splitting and CO2 conversion,11 lithium ion battery,35 ultracapacitors,36 and so forth. Thus, H plasma-induced modification
of the chemical state would provide helpful information to various
research fields relating to nitrogen-doped graphite. Our results demonstrated
that H plasma treatment significantly changed the electronic states
of graphite and provided a solid foundation for the utilization of
graphite in various applications.

Experimental Section
In all experiments in this paper, we used a purchased HOPG sample:
AGraphZ grade manufactured from AtomGraph AG. A p-HOPG sample was
prepared by cleaving a HOPG crystal in air and annealing at 600 °C
for 1 h under a vacuum of 1 × 10–6 Pa. XPS
indicated no trace of impurities such as oxygen, nitrogen, and so
forth. Nitrogen-doped HOPG (N-HOPG) was obtained by exposing the p-HOPG
to N2 plasma under the following condition: N2 gas pressure of 1 Pa, N2 gas flow rate of 2 sccm, rf
power of 10 W, and treatment time for 30 min. Hydrogen plasma treatment
on the p- and N-HOPG samples was carried out under the following condition:
H2 gas pressure of 10 Pa, H2 gas flow rate of
10 sccm, and rf power of 10 W. The plasma-treated sample was transferred
into an analysis chamber without breaking vacuum for XPS and ultraviolet
photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements.

The nitrogen
concentration was the average of the graphene layers
within the probing depth, six layers. In all measurements, the photoelectron
emitted around the angle of 30° from the surface normal in the
case of XPS and 0° in the case of UPS. The apparatus was described
in the previous report.34 A Mg Kα
(hν = 1253.6 eV) light source (Thermo VG Scientific,
XR3E2) and a monochromatized He I (hν = 21.2
eV) light source (SPECS, UVS 300 with TMM 302) were used for the XPS
and UPS measurements, respectively. Taking account of inhomogeneity
in the specimens, the work function was evaluated by the rising of
cutoff energy of the UPS spectrum, which was measured with a sample
bias of −5 V. The stability in atmosphere was investigated
by exposing the sample to ambience for 3 h. To remove adsorbed species
such as water and oxygen, the sample was annealed at 130, 250, and
600 °C before the XPS/UPS measurement. To estimate sample defects,
Raman spectroscopy (JASCO, NRS-3100) was carried out with a 532 nm
excitation laser.
