The combination of the selective catalytic reduction technology
with catalytic filters constitutes one of the most efficient ways
for diesel engine exhaust treatment. In this paper, the development
of catalytic ceramic papers as structured systems for the abatement
of diesel soot particles is addressed. Ceramic papers were prepared
by the dual-polyelectrolyte papermaking method, which is based on
the conventional papermaking technique used for cellulosic papers,
in which a portion of cellulosic fibers is replaced by ceramic ones.
The deposition of Co and Ce as catalytic materials by the wet spray
method on ceramic papers was studied for the development of structured
catalysts using an ultrasonic nebulizer and different solvents. The
use of alcohol–water solutions for the impregnation of cobalt
generated smaller particles and a high dispersion of them on the ceramic
fibers, greater than that obtained when pure water was employed. Temperature
programmed oxidation (TPO) assays showed that the best catalytic performance
was acquired with the catalysts generated with alcohol solvents, showing
a maximum rate for soot combustion at a temperature close to 400 °C.
The adequate soot combustion performance and the high thermal and
catalytic stability make catalytic ceramic papers impregnated by the
wet spray method, promising systems for their application as diesel
particulate filters.

1 Introduction
Fibrous structures offer
high surface to volume ratio and high
void fractions that make them attractive for catalytic applications.
Besides, they are cheaper, can be adapted to various geometries, and
have better coatability compared to microreactors.1 Different materials can be used to synthesize fibers, which
in turn can be conformed in a variety of cellular structures. For
example, metallic fibers can be easily fabricated as wire mesh structures,
which can be easily stacked inside cylindrical cartridges.2 Fibers made of carbon or glass can be structured
in the form of felts and they have been successfully applied to the
treatment of drinking water.3

Another
possible arrangement consists in a paper-like structure,
which could be made of ceramic fibers instead of cellulosic ones.
Ceramic papers constitute a fibrous interconnected matrix with pore-type
spaces that benefits gas diffusion.4 The
employment of ceramic and cellulosic fibers during the papermaking
process produces ceramic papers resistant to severe thermal conditions
after calcination (temperatures above 900 °C).5

The development of ceramic paper has two important
challenging
aspects: the mechanical strength, which can be achieved through the
incorporation of binder agents during paper manufacturing,6 and the deposition of the catalytic material,
which should be homogeneously dispersed and firmly anchored to the
fibers. Catalytic ceramic papers have been reported to be efficient
for a variety of gas-phase reactions with industrial and environmental
concern. Among them, reforming reactions,7−12 hydrocarbon dehydrogenation,13,14 nitric oxide reduction,4,15 and CO oxidation5 have been studied.

The oxidation of diesel soot is an application with significant
environmental interest, which involves a solid reactant (soot particles)
and gas-phase compounds (oxygen and nitric oxide). Diesel engines
are widely employed both in light and heavy vehicles because of their
durability, reliability, and fuel economy. Today, between 40 and 50%
of the vehicles sold in Europe are powered by diesel engines, and
they are also extensively used all over the world. However, the exhaust
gases emitted by these engines have high concentrations of the particulate
material (soot) and nitrogen oxides that are harmful to human health
and environment.

So far, the most adequate treatment to abate
particulate matter
consists in employing filters capable of retaining the soot particles.
To tolerate adequately the operation conditions, these filters should
be chemically, thermally, and mechanically resistant, especially during
the regeneration step that could originate high-temperature spots.
Besides, they should have high retention capacity to trap efficiently
the soot particles present in the exhaust gases. Thus, an attractive
application of catalytic papers is the development of a structure
that may act simultaneously as a particulate filter as well as a catalyst
with the possibility of self-regeneration (passive regeneration).16−19

With focus on the above-mentioned challenge, this contribution
presents a new method for the deposition of Co and Ce onto ceramic
papers, which consists in the ultrasound-assisted formation of micrometric
droplets of the catalyst precursors. The use of different solvents
to prepare the precursor solutions of active phases and its effect
on the active-phase dispersion and the catalytic performance is analyzed.
As a matter of fact, Khmelev reported that the properties of the solvents
(viscosity and surface tension) define the diameter of drops formed
by nebulization.20 After calcination, a
system applicable for the soot combustion reaction was conformed,
for which we present a thorough characterization. Activity and stability
experiments on diesel soot combustion are also discussed.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Catalytic Coating: Morphology
and Physical
Chemistry Properties
The average weight of the active phase
incorporated onto the substrates is summarized in Table 1. The weight increments correspond
to a set of three papers used in the catalytic tests, referred to
the same bare ceramic papers. A more significant weight gain can be
observed when the papers were impregnated with the most concentrated
solutions (0.3 M), when using water as a solvent. Because of the higher
molecular weight of cerium, the higher the Ce–Co proportion
is, the higher weight percent gained. On the other hand, the amount
of active phase deposited can be increased by modifying the solvent.
Indeed, solvents with lower surface tension favor the amount of catalyst
deposited, being the order of weight increment: isopropyl alcohol
> ethanol > polyvinyl alcohol ≅ water. This result is
in agreement
with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs that will be discussed
below.

and Ce, respectively. Z is the molar concentration
of the (Ce + Co) solution and

Figure 1 shows the
SEM micrographs of catalytic ceramic papers impregnated with cobalt
nitrate aqueous solutions (W) with different concentrations:
0.05, 0.15, and 0.30 M. The lowest concentration leads to a scarce
cobalt deposition onto the ceramic fibers (Figure 1A), whereas the 0.15 M solution (Figure 1B) allows the deposition
of more significant amounts of cobalt, both onto the ceramic fibers
and onto the cerium oxide.

Figure 1 SEM micrographs of the catalytic ceramic papers
[Co100Ce0 (Z – W)], prepared
from aqueous solutions
(W) with different concentrations (Z): 0.05 (A), 0.15 (B), and 0.30 M (C,D).

The morphology of the catalytic material deposited from a
0.30
M solution was variable. Two different forms were observed: (i) droplets
of an average size 30 × 15 μm (Figure 1C) and (ii) small particles of an average
2 μm with a random dispersion (Figure 1D). However, the first one was the predominant
morphology.

The effect of the solvent in the active-phase morphology
and distribution
can be observed in Figure 2. A better distribution and smaller particle sizes than those
obtained with aqueous solution were observed in all cases. Figure 2A shows that the
use of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) produced small particles and well
dispersed over the ceramic fibers. Impregnation with isopropyl alcohol
also shows a homogeneous deposition of the active material on the
ceramic fibers (Figure 2B), with particle shape and distribution similar to that obtained
with PVA. Figure 2C,D
shows the catalytic ceramic paper obtained by impregnation with the
ethanol-based solution. A similar morphology to that obtained by impregnation
with isopropyl alcohol is observed. In addition, the deposition of
the active phase occurred over the whole ceramic paper (Figure 2D).

Figure 2 SEM images of the catalytic
ceramic papers [Co100Ce0 (0.15 – S)] prepared
with different solvents (S): polyvinyl alcohol (A),
isopropyl alcohol (B), and ethanol (C,D).

Table 2 lists
the
surface tension values of the solutions used for the impregnation
by spray method. The better distribution of the active phase onto
the ceramic fibers obtained with the alcohol-based solutions compared
to those obtained with water could be related to the decrease in the
surface tension, which favors the wetting of fibers since causes lower
contact angles.

In order to investigate the element dispersion,
energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) mapping of catalytic ceramic papers is shown in Figures 3 and 4. As expected, constituent elements of the ceramic fibers
(aluminum and silicon) are present throughout the fiber analyzed.
Cobalt (Co) and cerium (Ce) are also found homogeneously distributed
on the surface of the fiber. The first one is deposited both on cerium
oxide binder and on the fiber surface. The distribution of active
phase over the fibers is improved with the PVA-based solution (Figure 4). This behavior
could also be observed when the other organic solvents were used.
In summary, the results indicate that the wet spray deposition method
is suitable for obtaining a good active-phase distribution onto the
ceramic substrate. Moreover, the dispersion is enhanced by controlling
some features of the impregnation solution, that is, surface tension.

Crystalline phases corresponding to the fluorite-like cubic
structure
of CeO2 and cobalt oxide spinel were identified in the
X-ray diffractograms (Figure 5). Characteristic signals of cobalt oxide are identified at
2θ (°) = 31.3, 36.9, 38.6, 44.8, 55.7, 59.4, 65.3, 68.7,
74.2, 77.4, and 78.5, corresponding to the crystalline planes 111,
220, 311, 222, 400, 422, 511, 440, 531, 620, 533, and 622, respectively
(JCPDS 421467). At 2θ (°) = 28.6, 33.1, 47.5, 76.8, and
79.1, the characteristic signals of cerium oxide (JCPDS 340394), corresponding
to the crystalline planes 111, 200, 220, 331, and 420, respectively,
are observed. The signals corresponding to the planes 311, 222, and
400 of the cerium oxide, overlap with that of the planes 422, 511,
and 531 of cobalt oxide.

Figure 5 Crystalline phases of the synthesized catalytic
ceramic papers.

The estimated sizes of
the CeO2 and Co3O4 crystallites raised
by spraying were calculated by the Scherrer
equation. The planes used for the calculation of the crystal size
were (111) and (220), respectively. The crystallite size of CeO2 resulted between 7 and 9 nm for all the catalysts [CoXCeY (0.30 – W)],
whereas the crystallite sizes of Co3O4 obtained
were 14 nm for Co100Ce0 (0.15 – W) and 16
nm for Co100Ce0 (0.30 – W). For the catalysts
with lower Co amounts, the crystallite sizes are not reported because
of the low intensity in the X-ray diffraction signals, which provokes
higher errors in their determination.

Raman spectra of different
samples (Figure 6)
show the five active vibration modes associated
with CO3O4. The modes A1g (691 cm–1), F2g (191, 521 and 681 cm–1), and Eg (488 cm–1) can be clearly
differentiated. At 465 cm–1, the characteristic
signal of the crystal structure cubic of CeO2 (fluorite)
is also observed. This is the only allowed mode, T2g, coming
from the symmetric vibration Ce–O–Ce.21

2.2 Catalytic Activity and Stability
Figures 7 and 8 show soot conversions obtained from temperature
programmed oxidation (TPO) experiments for different catalytic
papers and the corresponding TPO profiles. The activity of ceramic
papers prepared using Al2O3 Nyacol as a binder
is also shown as a blank. The change of cobalt concentration from
0.15 to 0.30 M or cerium incorporation to the solution leads to a
slight shift of maximum conversion temperature toward lower values,
thus indicating a promoter effect on the catalytic activity. If the
ceramic papers (C.P.) are analyzed, a catalytic effect of cerium oxide
used as a binder is also observed. The catalytic activity of cerium
oxide is related to its oxygen storage capacity and the formation
of superoxides on the surface, which would react with the neighboring
carbons or recombine to form O2.22

Figure 7 Catalytic
behavior on soot conversion for the prepared ceramic
papers. Reactor feed: 20 mL/min (18% O2 + 0.1% NO, helium
balance). Soot was loaded from a suspension of soot in hexane (600
ppm), being the amount loaded approximately 1 mg. (a) Soot conversion

solutions. Cobalt nitrate was dissolved in different solvents: water

loaded from a 600 ppm soot suspension in hexane. (a) Soot conversion
as a function of the combustion temperature. (b) TPO profiles.

The temperature of the noncatalytic
combustion of soot is above
550 °C, which is close to that obtained when an alumina binder
is used (C.P. Al2O3 binder, Figure 7). The use of ceria Nyacol
as a binder decreases this maximum combustion rate temperature in
about 50 °C. The catalytic activity is further enhanced after
the incorporation of either Co and/or Ce nitrate solutions. Like cerium
oxide, cobalt oxide presents variable oxidation states (Co3+/Co2+), which improve the storage—release of O2 of the catalytic system. Also, Co species contributes to
the oxygen availability of the catalyst.23

The differences in catalytic activity among the catalytic
ceramic
papers loaded with Co using different concentrations of the impregnation
solutions are not significant. However, SEM and EDX analysis showed
that the best distribution of the catalyst is achieved with the 0.15
M solution. Furthermore, the use of alcoholic solvents instead of
water is beneficial to some extent for the catalytic activity. This
effect would be related to a better soot–catalyst contact because
of an improved catalyst distribution onto the fibers, also observed
from SEM micrographs.

Despite the catalytic effect of CeO2 incorporated as
a binder was verified, the incorporation of cerium in the precursor
solutions significantly improved the performance of the catalytic
papers, as well as the addition of cobalt solution did. Nevertheless,
the increase in the cobalt concentration from 0.15 to 0.30 M did not
significantly modify the catalytic behavior. For this reason, Co100Ce0
(0.15 – W) was selected among the catalysts
prepared using water as a solvent, as a representative sample for
the subsequent analysis of the catalytic performance.

Figure 8 depicts
the effect of the use of different solvents for the 0.15 M solutions
used for the impregnation of ceramic papers. It can be observed that
the use of alcohol solutions enhances the performance of ceramic papers
as compared with those prepared with water solutions. This behavior
is in agreement with characterization results that indicated a better
distribution of cobalt in the ceramic matrix.

Stability tests
were performed for Co100Ce0 (0.15 – W). Figure 9 shows the temperatures
at 10, 50, and 90% of soot conversion (T10, T50, and T90) for 15 consecutive
tests. The analysis was also performed for the catalytic papers impregnated
with the different solvents. Table 3 summarizes temperature T10, T50, and T90 values for the catalytic papers impregnated
with water and solvent mixtures.

a Values extracted
from Figure 9.

The catalytic ceramic papers prepared
by the wet spray method showed
a high catalytic stability after 15 TPO cycles under the same conditions,
even when the maximum temperature of the tests is high (600 °C).
This behavior provides promising results for future developments.
It should be noted that after the cycles of reusing, the papers showed
no mechanical wear that would hinder their handling or lead to their
rupture.

In order to evaluate the performance of these structures
in soot
combustion with different soot–catalyst ratios, four consecutive
TPO tests were carried out with different soot loadings (600, 1200,
1800, and 2400 ppm) on the same sample (Co100Ce0 (0.15 M – W)). After 16 successive TPO runs, these samples were evaluated
again with the 600 ppm soot suspension, designated as 600 ppm (b), Figure 10. Table 4 summarizes the average soot
load produced by each soot suspension and the soot/catalyst ratio
used.

Figure 10 Catalytic stability of Co100Ce0 (0.15 – W) impregnated with different amounts of soot from suspensions with
600, 1200, 1800, and 2400 ppm. “b” indicates that the
suspension of 600 ppm was used in two series of nonconsecutive runs
(cycles 1–4 and 17–20). Reactor feed: 20 mL/min (18%
O2 + 0.1% NO, diluted in helium).

Figure 10 shows
the temperatures for the maximum rate of combustion for the evaluated
samples. No significant changes were observed in the activity of the
catalytic papers when exposing them to different types of interactions
with the diesel soot. This would indicate a high stability of the
systems against different interactions with the particulate material.

It is well-known the oxidizing character of NO and its contribution
to the combustion of soot. In order to evaluate the Co100Ce0 (0.15
– W) catalytic papers under poorer oxidation
conditions, four TPO tests were carried out using 600 and 2400 ppm
soot suspensions without NO in the feed. The results were compared
with TPO tests for ceramic papers with 600 and 2400 ppm carried out
with 0.1% NO and 0% NO. Figure 11 shows the maximum combustion rate temperature of these
tests. A high stability of the catalytic systems can be observed with
different soot concentrations under poor oxidizing conditions. Moreover,
no significant differences were observed comparing the performance
for catalytic ceramic papers under the absence of NO or presence of
NO. It should be noted that nitrogen oxides are present in the exhaust
gases of diesel engines.

In order to subject the structure
to extreme temperature conditions,
similar to those that can be generated during filter operation, a
set of Co100Ce0 (0.15 – W) papers was calcined
at 900 °C for three different times (1, 30, and 120 min). Figure 12 shows the soot
conversion of Co100Ce0 (0.15 – W) calcined
at 600 and 900 °C for 1, 30, and 120 min and the corresponding
TPO curves. A slight increase in the temperature of the maximum burning
rate about 40 °C is observed, when the samples are submitted
by 2 h at 900 °C, thus evidencing the high thermal stability
of these structured systems.

3 Conclusions
The wet spray method developed showed to be convenient to achieve
a homogeneous deposition of the Ce and Co oxide precursors onto ceramic
fibers. Active and stable structured catalysts were obtained.

The decrease in the surface tension of the precursor solutions
resulted in a better distribution of the active phases onto the ceramic
fibers, thus increasing the soot–catalyst contact and improving
the catalytic activity.

TPO experiments showed that cerium and
cobalt oxides act as active
centers in the catalytic combustion of diesel soot. Although no significant
differences were observed between the CoXCeY (Z – W) catalysts,
the best performance was obtained for the catalyst with the equimolar
mixture of cobalt and cerium.

Synthesized catalysts showed excellent
thermal and chemical stability,
even when they were submitted to high temperatures (900 °C).
Despite the different soot loadings, the activity was maintained.
This fact corroborates the correct distribution of the active phases
onto ceramic fibers, thus making the wet spray method a useful tool
for the preparation of structured catalysts.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Ceramic Papers Preparation
A papermaking
technique with a dual-polyelectrolyte retention system was used to
prepare ceramic papers.7−15 CeO2 nanoparticles and polyelectrolytes were added in
order to give mechanical resistance and favor the formation of flocs,
respectively.

First, 10 g of ceramic fibers (50 wt % SiO2, 48 wt % Al2O3), purified by elutriation
and washing, was dispersed into a 1000 mL NaCl (0.01 M) aqueous solution
under continuous stirring. Then, specific reagents were added in the
following proportions and order: 66 g of cationic polyelectrolyte
polyvinyl amine (Luredur PR 8095), 5 g of CeO2 nanoparticle
colloidal suspension (20% wt %, Nyacol), and 23 g of anionic polyelectrolyte
polyacrylamide (A-PAM Aquatec, molecular weight 104 to
105 g/mol). After that, 1.5 g of cellulosic fibers was
added to the mixture.

Finally, a sheet of 16 cm of diameter
was formed by applying pressure
(350 kPa) for 5 min and then again for 2 min. Then, the sheet was
dried under controlled atmosphere (23 °C, 50% RH) for 24 h and
then calcined in air at 600 °C for 2 h.

4.2 Wet Spray
Deposition
With the aim
of improving the dispersion of the active phase as well as the catalytic
and mechanical stability, a wet spray method was developed. This method
represents a modification of that reported by Tuler et al.18 in which a dry spray was used, yielding a poor
mechanical stability of the deposited particles. An ultrasonic nebulizer
(Aspen NU410) was employed, and several catalytic papers were prepared
by varying the Co–Ce atomic ratio in the precursor solution.
To the impregnation stage, it is necessary to use a vacuum system.
Ceramic papers were cut into discs (Ø = 16 mm)
and inserted into a sample holder (see Figure 13). The disc was submitted to the fog generated
from the corresponding solution for 2 min by each side. After that,
the ceramic papers were dried at room temperature for 24 h, and then,
they were calcined in air at 600 °C during 2 h. In this way,
catalytic ceramic papers were obtained.

Figure 13 Scheme of the equipment
used for the “wet spray”
deposition.

The catalytic ceramic
papers were named as CoXCeY (Z – S), where X and Y are the relative
molar percentages of Co and Ce, respectively, Z is
the molar concentration of the (Ce + Co) solution, and S is the solvent
used to dissolve the precursors: water (W), ethanol 40% v/v (E), isopropyl
alcohol 60% v/v (I), and poly(vinyl alcohol) 0.5% w/v (P). The concentration
of alcohol was selected in order to modify the surface tension in
the 20–70 mN m–1 range.

4.3 Characterization
The morphology of
the synthesized papers was observed by SEM with a Phenom World ProX
equipment (10 kV acceleration voltage). The composition and elemental
dispersion were studied by EDX analysis with a device coupled to the
microscope and 20 kV of acceleration voltage.

A Shimadzu XD-D1
instrument (Cu Kα radiation) was used in order to analyze crystalline
phases. A range between 15° and 80° at a scan rate of 2°/min
was measured.

A Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR instrument was employed
to obtain
laser Raman spectra. The excitation wavelength was 532.13 nm and the
laser power was set at 30 mW.

Surface tension values were obtained
by the ring method using a
Du Noüy tensiometer.

4.4 Catalytic Activity Tests
Soot particles
were obtained by burning commercial diesel fuel (YPF, Argentina).
Then, the soot was dried in a stove at 120 °C for 24 h. Finally,
it was dispersed in n-hexane and suspensions of different
concentrations of soot were prepared, ranging from 600 to 2400 ppm.
A thorough characterization of the prepared soot is reported elsewhere.24

First, catalytic ceramic discs were impregnated
by dripping with the soot suspension. Then, they were dried overnight
at room temperature. To evaluate the catalytic activity and stability,
soot-impregnated ceramic paper discs were stacked into a quartz reactor
and then they were heated at 5 °C/min, from 25 up to 600 °C.
The feeding was composed by O2 (18%) + NO (X) diluted in high purity He. The used NO concentration was 0 or 0.1%,
according to the test. The total flow rate was maintained in 20 mL/min.
The exhaust gases were analyzed by a Shimadzu GC-2014 chromatograph
with a thermal conductivity detector.

Stability runs were carried
out using the same ceramic paper discs
and incorporating soot after each TPO run. Both the feeding composition
and the amount of soot loaded for each run were varied.

Despite
the soot-to-catalyst contact conditions are far from those
found in a real engine, they were selected in order to study the soot
combustion reaction under controlled experiments. In this way, it
is possible to regulate the amounts of soot loaded, which allows the
comparison of the catalytic behavior of different structured systems.
