Hexa-p-tert-butylcalix[6]arene (1) is believed
to adopt a winged conformation in a solution,
featured by four phenyl rings perpendicular to the calix basis and
two others at 1,4-positions lying down. However, there is some controversy
on the occurrence of this conformation because it has never been found
in the solid state of calix[6]arenes, regardless of the substitution
pattern at lower and upper rims. Here, we have observed the winged-cone
conformation for the first time in a solvate form of 1 with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide, and pyridine.
The DMSO molecule is strongly encapsulated into 1 through
two OH···O hydrogen bonds with both flattened phenolic
moieties, one lp(S)···π and four CH···π
interactions with the four perpendicular phenyl rings. This host–guest
complex has energy lower by 23.4 kcal mol–1 than
the isolated species. In addition, another DMSO solvate form with
1,2,3-alternate conformation was also obtained in this study, and
its structure is compared with that of the precedent one. A detailed
density functional theory study has also been carried out to understand
the energetic relationships among cone conformers, intramolecular
hydrogen-bonding patterns, and DMSO encapsulation.

1 Introduction
Calixarenes
are macrocyclic compounds comprising phenolic units
bonded to each other at 2,5-positions through methylene groups.1 The number of phenolic units can range according
to synthetic conditions (e.g., reaction time and temperature) and
catalyst (e.g., NaOH or KOH), four, six, and eight units being the
most common ones.2 Among them, the subset
made up of four phenolic units, namely, calix[4]arenes, has been better
investigated structurally than those composed with six (calix[6]arenes)
and eight (calix[8]arenes) units.3 The
conformations adopted by calix[4]arenes in both solution and solid
states are well understood, as well as many solid-state structures
are reported for them.4 To the best of
our knowledge, there are 2866 entries in the CSD (version 5.38 with
November 2016 update; 858 655 entries) for general calix[4]arenes,
whereas this number is 295 and 138 for the compounds with minimal
framework of calix[6]arene and calix[8]arene, respectively.

The decorating of upper and lower rims means the recipe of getting
new calixarenes for many desired properties, mainly for host–guest
purposes.5 Before getting such planned
compounds, the synthesis of hexa-p-tert-butylcalix[n]arenes is the most widely used first step in the process
due to its practical and rentable synthesis from p-tert-butylphenol, besides allowing easy control of the phenolic units
number.6 Due to its leading role in the
synthetic routes of most calixarenes, these compounds with p-tert-butyl groups at the upper rim are templates for the
comprehension of structural and inclusion phenomena.7

In this sense, compounds with six p-tert-butyl
groups at the upper rim are the best investigated calix[6]arenes from
the structural point of view. This can be viewed in its 185 known
crystal structures (ca. 63% of all of calix[6]arenes entries in the
CSD). Concerning the target compound of this study, hexa-p-tert-butylcalix[6]arene (1), which is undecorated at the
lower rim, has 13 crystal structures, a considerably large number
if the few overall calix[6]arene structures in the CSD are taken into
account. Interesting trends have been drawn from the available structural
studies. For instance, it was found that 1 adopts a pinched
cone conformation in the solid state when crystallizing with solvents
that are not able to establish classical hydrogen bonds (hereinafter
called as nonhydrogen-bonding solvents). On the contrary, 1,2,3-alternate
conformation is preferred in the presence of hydrogen-bonding solvents.8 Even though this calixarene has been well studied
structurally, an old controversy remains. Molins et al.9 suggested in 1992 that 1 assumes
a so-called winged conformation featured by four phenyl rings oriented
perpendicularly to the molecule basis and two at 1,4-positions being
entirely flattened. However, their conclusion was based only on the
NMR data in solution. No evidence for such a conformation in the solid
state was available at the beginning of 1990s, thus providing an argument
to Reinhoudt group10 in 1996 to assign
a pinched cone conformation as that existing in a solution. This conclusion
was based on two main factors: the lower energy of the pinched cone
and its occurrence in several crystal structures. In the course of
the next two decades, other structures with pinched cone conformation
have been reported for 1 in the solid state,11 but winged cone has not reported for any calix[6]arene
thus far.

Here, we prepared a new multiple solvate form of 1 with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide (DMF),
and pyridine.
In this solvate, the winged-cone conformation was found for the first
time in the solid state. It has one C2 axis as the only molecular symmetry, as originally suggested by
Molins et al.9 Furthermore, the whole DMSO
molecule is strongly encapsulated into the winged cone through seven
contacts (four CH···π, two OH···O,
and one lone pair (lp)(S)···π) with
the six phenolic moieties. In addition to this unprecedented conformation
in solid state, this solvate does not follow the trend of 1,2,3-alternate
conformation when hydrogen-bonding solvents are cocrystallized, reinforcing
the rarity of the structure reported here. We have also isolated another
new solvate form of 1, which is also presented here in
full detail. This has only DMSO as the crystallization solvent and
is the second finding of a DMSO solvate form of 1. Also,
a detailed density functional theory (DFT) study was performed here,
which helped us to understand the energetic relationships among conformations,
intramolecular hydrogen-bond patterns, and DMSO encapsulation.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Description of the Winged
Cone
The
multiple solvate of 1 with DMSO, DMF, and pyridine crystallizes
with one molecule of each in the asymmetric unit (triclinic space
group P̅1; Table S1 and Figure S1a). This crystal form means an important structural
knowledge into calixarene chemistry in reason of two factors. First,
we isolated for the first time in the solid state, the winged-cone
conformation with a C2 axis as the only
symmetry element for a compound with the calix[6]arene basis (Figure 1b), regardless of
the substitution pattern in the upper or lower rim. On the basis of
low-temperature NMR spectral analysis, this conformation has been
already suggested by Molins et al.9 in
CD2Cl2 solution for the same calixarene studied
here, the latter being questioned by Reinhoudt group10 due to the higher stability of the pinched cone conformation
by 16.2 kcal mol–1 and the occurrence of the former
in several solid-state structures. In turn, winged conformation has
not been reported in the solid state up till now.

Figure 1 (a) Strong entrapping
of DMSO in the multiple solvate of 1. (b) Top and (c)
side views of the winged cone of 1 found in this solvate.
In all of the panels, CH hydrogens
of 1 were omitted and phenolic labeling scheme is shown.

The winged-cone conformation can
be described by an almost complete
flattening of the 1,4-phenyl rings, labeled as A and D, which, respectively,
form the angles of 9.91(10) and 9.74(10)°, with the average molecular
plane calculated through the four methylene carbons bonded at 2,5-positions
of the two flattened phenyl rings. Just these four methylene carbons
are coplanar, but all of the six ones point their hydrogens outward
the cone, as believed previously, whereas two methylene groups point
inward the pinched cone. The capital letters from A to F were used
to label the phenolic moieties in both structures reported here (Figure S1), and they have been employed to refer
to both phenyl rings and their oxygens throughout the text and drawings.
The other four aromatic rings are almost perpendicular, forming the
angles of 77.46(9)° (B), 86.72(11)° (C), 82.44(10)°
(E), and 84.99(10)° (F), with the mean molecular plane just defined.
All of the six methylene groups are pointed outward the winged cone.

A similar winged conformation has been found in a coordination
complex in which all of the OH groups undergo deprotonation and all
of the resulting phenolate oxygens are coordinated to iron ions entrapped
in the minor cavity.12 Furthermore, the
four phenolate oxygens belonging to the perpendicular aromatic rings
are further coordinated to potassium ions. However, the occurrence
of such a conformation in this structure cannot be extrapolated to
free calix[6]arenes because electrostatic and coordination bonds dramatically
change the conformational equilibrium. Even so, a C2v molecular symmetry without a cone
distortion is observed in such calix[6]arene, differing therefore
from that found in this study.

2.2 DFT Calculations
on Pinched, 1,2,3-Alternate
and Winged-Cone Conformers
To get energetic insights into
the conformational preference of 1, we undertook DFT
calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. To explore the most
stable cone conformations, several rotamers were generated by exhaustive
modifications of the dihedral angles of all of the OH groups starting
from the crystal structures of the winged cone and 1,2,3-alternate
structures determined in this study, and the pinched cone one from
a literature crystal structure (CSD reference code TECDUB).11b The C–H coordinates of all of the rotamers
were partially optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory while
freezing the internal coordinates of all of heavy atoms, and the lowest
energy conformation found in each case was next fully optimized without
constrains at the same theory level. The coordinates of all of the
optimized rotamers can be found in the Supporting Information.

The fully optimized structure of the winged-cone
conformer yielded an idealized C2 symmetry
molecule with two perpendicular phenyl rings with twists of 69.36
and 84.55° and just one flattened ring with a bent of 2.14°.
It is less stable by 15.9 kcal mol–1 than the lowest
energy pinched cone conformer, which is the most stable one among
all of the evaluated conformers due to its six intramolecular hydrogen
bonds. This theoretical pinched cone conformer does not differ significantly
from that used as the starting geometry.11b Such an energy difference is in agreement with that found by Reinhoudt
group (16.2 kcal mol–1).10 Interestingly, according to our calculations, the winged cone is
the highest energy conformation in the gas phase because the 1,2,3-alternate
conformation is less stable than the pinched cone by 11.8 kcal mol–1. Such a stability order, namely, pinched cone >
1,2,3-alternate
> winged cone, was also found in another DFT approach for 1.13 However, in that study, only
the input
of the pinched cone conformation came from a solid-state structure.

2.3 Hydrogen Bonds in Winged-Cone Conformers:
Description and DFT Calculations
The loss of the mirror symmetry
in the winged-cone conformer was attributed to the clockwise (CW)
or counterclockwise (CCW) sense of six cyclic intramolecular hydrogen
bonds.9 However, our structure shows that
the formation of a C2 winged cone is not
dependent of such an intramolecular hydrogen-bonding array. The asymmetric
cone distortion and the consequent mirror symmetry loss occur with
only two intramolecular OH···O interactions, and neither
CW nor CCW sense is found. Only two intramolecular hydrogen bonds
are formed between the perpendicular phenol moieties (Figure 1b), whereas the other four
OH groups are intermolecular hydrogen-bonding donors to solvent molecules
(Figures 1a and 2b, Table S2 for contacts
metrics). Two perpendicular OH groups are hydrogen-bonding donors
to DMF and pyridine, which are located outside the calixarene cone
(Figure 2). The two
OH moieties of the wings are hydrogen-bonding donors to oxygen from
DMSO (Figure 1a), which
is entirely entrapped into the cone.

Figure 2 (a) Overview of the crystal packing in
the multiple solvate of 1. All of the hydrogens are hidden
in this picture. (b) Hydrogen
bonds (cyan dashed lines) involving DMF, Pyr, and 1.
Only hydrogens participating in the shown interactions are not hidden
in this drawing, where t-butyl groups are also omitted.
Labeling scheme is shown for phenolic groups and nonhydrogen solvent
atoms acting as hydrogen-bonding donor or acceptor.

However, the lowest-energy winged-cone conformer
is present with
either CW or CCW sense of four noncyclic intramolecular hydrogen bonds,
wherein the OH groups from both flattened rings act only as acceptors.
This conformer is labeled as W1 and can be viewed in Figure 3a together with other conformers
having energy up to 10 kcal mol–1 above that of
W1. For all of them, two mirror conformers have the same energy and
can be converted into each other by simultaneously changing the sense
of all of the OH hydrogen positions and distorting the cone toward
the other side. This can be clearly noted in Figure 3a, where the two possible W1 conformers with
either CW or CCW sense of four noncyclic intramolecular hydrogen bonds
are shown. If just one of the two flattened phenolic moieties acts
as a hydrogen-bonding donor, there is an increase of 0.5 kcal mol–1 in the energy in the second-ranked gas-phase conformation
(conformer W2). In this case, such CW and CCW senses are lost, but
the four intramolecular OH···O bonds are still kept.
However, if either CW or CCW sense of the four hydrogen bonds is featured
with both flattened phenolic groups being donors, which is the same
of changing the hydrogen bonds sense without distorting the cone,
the energy is higher by 3.2 kcal mol–1 (conformer
W5) than that of the lowest-energy conformer. Similarly, a higher-energy
conformer, destabilized by 7.6 kcal mol–1 relative
to the lowest-energy conformer, is observed if the hydrogen bonds
sense of the second-ranked conformer is changed without cone distortion
(conformer W6 in Figure 3a). Just one winged-cone conformer with two intramolecular hydrogen
bonds (conformer W8 in Figure 3a) has energy within the 10 kcal mol–1 range
above the most stable one. If only the four perpendicular phenolic
groups of this last conformer are considered, there is a CW or CCW
sense of OH hydrogen orientation, which does not occur in the crystal
geometry (Figure 1b).

Figure 3 (a) Winged-cone
and (b) 1,2,3-alternate conformations of 1, optimized
at B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory, whose energy
is up to 10 kcal mol–1 above the most stable conformer
(Erel = 0.0 kcal mol–1). Crystal geometries determined in this study are used as an input
and only hydrogens were not constrained in the calculations. Conformer
labeling is also shown. All of the shown conformers have two mirror
images of identical energies, as illustrated only for W1.

2.4 DMSO Encapsulation into
Winged-Cone and Crystal
Packing
The winged-cone conformer found in the multiple solvate
has energy 10 kcal mol–1 above that of the most
stable winged-cone conformer, which should be compensated intermolecularly.
Also, there is a need to overcome the 15.9 kcal mol–1 difference relative to the lowest-energy pinched cone conformer.
Even so, just the DMSO encapsulation energy appears to be almost enough
to allow this unfavorable conformation. The DFT-optimized host–guest
complex between 1 and DMSO, also starting from the crystal
coordinates, has the energy lower by 23.4 kcal mol–1 than the sum of the energies of the isolated species optimized at
the same level of theory. This encapsulation energy is high and demonstrates
how the strength of DMSO is entrapped into the winged cone. In fact,
DMSO molecule is strongly held into the calixarene cavity by using
intermolecularly its whole molecule. There are seven contacts of three
types between DMSO and 1. Besides accepting the two classical
hydrogen bonds from the two flattened OH groups, its two methyl moieties
are involved in four CH···π interactions. Likewise,
one lp(S)···π interaction between
sulfur atom and the aromatic π-system occurs too. The latter
interaction is even responsible for the disorder found in the DMSO
molecule. Its sulfur atom stays in two sites of 70 and 30% occupancy
each, whereas its methyl carbon and oxygen, however, have occupied
just one 100% occupancy site, common to both positions. Consequently,
in one position (70% occupancy), sulfur atom interacts with ring E,
and, in another one (30% occupancy), it is interacting with ring B.
The major and minor occupancy sulfur sites are distanced by 3.336(2)
and 3.372(5) Å from the centroids calculated through carbons
of rings E and B, respectively. In fact, lp(S)···π
interactions are known as noncovalent contacts stabilizing the solid-state
structures of small molecules14 and also
the folding of biomolecules.15 Here, it
helps in strongly holding a guest into its host.

The second
worthy structural finding of this multiple solvate resides in the
observation of a cone conformation together with the hydrogen-bonding
solvents, contrary to the tendency that such a conformation is adopted
only in the presence of nonhydrogen-bonding solvents. Hydrogen-bonding
solvents (DMSO, acetone, dioxane/water, DMF) have induced 1,2,3-alternate
conformation,8 whereas the pinched cone
conformation is related to the crystallization of nonhydrogen-bonding
solvents (benzene, chloroform, acetonitrile, carbon disulfide, tetrachloroethylene,
toluene, dichloromethane, bromobenzene, and chlorobenzene).11 Therefore, our structure is an exception to
this series. At last, the overall packing of the multiple solvate
is featured by the formation of layers of host–guest complexes,
which are face-to-face packed on top of each other (Figure 2a). Their tail-to-tail packing
does not occur due to the intercalation of a solvent layer made up
of pyridine and DMF molecules (Figure 2a). These two solvents act as cross-links between the
lower rims of calixarene molecules on the adjacent layers through
the aforementioned classical hydrogen bonds and several further nonclassical
CHpyr/DMF···Ocalix ones, as shown
in Figure 2b.

2.5 DMSO Solvate
Here, we have also isolated
another new solvate of 1. Its structure was solved in
the monoclinic space group C2/c with one calixarene and two DMSO molecules in the asymmetric
unit (Table S1 and Figure S1b). This is
the second report of a DMSO solvate of 1 because there
is a literature precedent with two and half DMSO molecules and one
calixarene in the asymmetric unit of a triclinic unit cell (P̅1 space group).8 In that
structure, two full occupancy solvent molecules correspond to those
found in our structure (see below their similar entrapping patterns),
whereas one fractional DMSO molecule of 50% occupancy was also found
there. It is important to state that we have identified a smeared
electron density in the difference Fourier map when refining our DMSO
solvate structure. However, it was not possible to assign it to any
fractional DMSO molecule. Therefore, the data were squeezed with Platon
in the latter stages of refinement, which was also applied to the
crystal data from the multiple solvate previously described.

In our DMSO solvate, however, it is possible to have a solvent fraction
in the remaining void of 402.5 Å3 solvent accessible
volume per unit cell. This hypothesis is reinforced if the formation
of channels where the voids and nonintegral DMSO molecules are in
our and in the known DMSO solvate, respectively (Figure 4), is taken into account. Here,
however, we will refer to our structure only as a solvate without
ascertaining the solvent stoichiometry because neither the presence
nor the amount of DMSO in the channel was concluded. In fact, the
crystals obtained in this study from a DMSO solution had diffracted
poorly even at a medium-resolution shell, precluding the assignment
of low electron density such as that from a fractional or disordered
solvent molecule. Even so, the found void has a volume compatible
to that of four DMSO molecules (molecular volume of 105.5 Å3),16 inferring, therefore, the
presence of half of one disordered DMSO in the asymmetric unit of
our solvate crystallized in the C2/c space group. This would totalize
two and half DMSO molecules in our solvate, as also occurred in the
literature.

solvates of 1 in (a) our study and (b) the literature.
In the left panels, a top view of the columns is displayed, detaching
the formation of voids and solvate channels in (a) and (b), respectively.
In the middle panels, a front view of the three columns made up of
four calixarene molecules each is shown. A top inset is detached to
show the calixarene rotation around the column axis and the different
weak contact patterns in (a) and (b). In the right panels, the intramolecular
and intermolecular hydrogen bonds are detailed as cyan dashed lines.
A top inset is devoted to show the different DMSO binding sites to
the side hydroxyl group in the two solvate forms. In (a), only the
hydrogens participating in the shown interactions are not hidden in
the right panel. The t-butyl groups were not omitted
only in the middle panels in (a) and (b). Alone capital letters refer
to the labeling scheme of the phenolic groups. DMSO oxygens were also
labeled in the right panel in (a).

2.6 Conformation and Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonds
in the DMSO Solvate: Description and DFT Calculations
Calixarene
conformations are resembled in both DMSO solvates (Figure 5) and follow the 1,2,3-alternate
conformation trend when isolated out from hydrogen-bonding solvents.
In both structures, there is the formation of two alternate cones
made up of the trimeric subunits ABC and DEF. Each trimeric subunit
has one middle (B or E) and two side (A and C or D and F) phenolic
moieties. However, these two halves are not similar. Compared with
D, E, and F, the three phenyl rings A, B, and C are more perpendicular
to the average molecular plane passing through the four methylene
carbons bonded to the two middle phenyl rings. In our solvate, the
least-square plane calculated through the phenyl rings from the first
subunit forms the angles of 48.91(15)° (A), 83.69(14)° (B),
and 64.94(18)° (C), with the mean molecular plane as defined
before, whereas these values for the phenyl rings in the another trimeric
subunit are 46.94(13)° (D), 44.01(14)° (E), and 44.16(13)°
(F). In the literature DMSO solvate, the corresponding measurements
are 46.4(2)° (A), 83.9(3)° (B), 66.6(3)° (C), 54.5(2)°
(D), 43.6(3)° (E), and 34.3(3)° (F).8 On the basis of these bent values, it is possible to observe that the phenyl
rings E and F are less inclined than those of all of the others in
both DMSO solvates, even though their bent is more resembled in our
solvate than in the previous one. Full optimization of the lowest-energy
conformer starting from our 1,2,3,-alternate conformer also revealed
the presence of two different subunits, with equivalent angles between
the phenyl rings A–F and the average calyx base of 48.62, 86.75,
54.92, 56.05, 29.53, and 45.99°.

Figure 5 Superposition of 1 in their
crystal conformation found
in the DMSO solvates in our (green) study and in the literature (orange).

The intramolecular pattern of
the hydrogen bonds is also conserved
in the solvates, with two interactions per subunit. In the subunit
ABC, hydroxyl group on one side is not an intramolecular hydrogen-bonding
donor, whereas in the DEF one, the middle hydroxyl moiety does not
donate a intramolecular hydrogen bonding (Figure 4, right panels; Table S3 for contacts metrics). These two OH groups are hydrogen-bonding
donors to DMSO oxygens instead (see below). To the best of our knowledge,
hydrogens have been not positioned in the antecedent structure. Therefore,
this is the first report of an accurate hydrogen-bonding geometry
in the solvates of 1 with hydrogen-bonding solvents.
Such different intramolecular hydrogen-bonding sets between the subunits
is a consequence of the interactions with DMSO because the 1,2,3-alternate
conformation found in the DMSO solvates is only the third ranked gas-phase
conformation (conformer A3 in Figure 3b). It has a higher energy of 6.8 kcal mol–1 relative to the most stable conformer, which is again featured by
either CW or CCW sense of four intramolecular noncyclic hydrogen bonds.
In this conformation, the absence of these senses is responsible for
an energy increase of 4.1 kcal mol–1 (conformer
A2 in Figure 3b).

2.7 Crystal Packing in the DMSO Solvate
Both
DMSO solvates are featured by the presence of columns comprised
of calixarene molecules intercalated by two entrapped DMSO molecules
(Figure 4). Consequently,
each half of the alternate double cone lies on the top of another
one. In this layout, the hydroxyl groups of one trimeric subunit are
packed close to the t-butyl moieties of another unit,
that is, phenolic units A, B, and C are face-to-tail packed on those
units labeled as D, E, and F, respectively. The first difference between
the two solvates rises from the rotation of calixarenes around the
column axis. If the literature DMSO solvate is taken as the reference,8 the calixarene molecules are rotated by ca. 60°
around the column axis in our solvate. This can be observed in the
side-to-side packing fashion of the columns (Figure 4, middle-top panels). In the literature solvate,
the middle phenolic units of calixarene molecules on the neighboring
columns are packed together through CHmethylene···π
contacts. On the other hand, in our solvate, side phenolic units C
are closer than the middle ones due to a weak π···π
interaction between them (Figure 4, middle-top panels). No CH···π
contact occurs when pillaring such columns in the DMSO solvate reported
here.

The difference between the two DMSO solvate forms does
not stop here. Even though a similar pattern of classical OHcalix···ODMSO hydrogen bonds is kept in both
structures, with one crystallographically independent DMSO molecule
hydrogen bonded to the middle phenolic OH group and another one to
a side hydroxyl moiety (Figure 4, right panels), there is a notable difference in the DMSO
interaction site in the calixarene molecules. In the known solvate,
each two solvent molecules interacting with the side hydroxyl groups
from the neighboring calixarenes packed into the column are related
by an inversion symmetry, that is, hydrogen-bonding OH donor moieties
lie on the opposite sides of the plane crossing through the 1,4-carbons
from the middle aromatic rings. In our structure, contrarily, these
two OH donor groups are related by a twofold rotation axis and are
on the same side of the plane aforementioned. These different sites
of DMSO binding to the side hydroxyl group can be viewed in Figure 4, at the right top
panels. Consequently, the orientation of DMSO molecules hydrogen bonded
to the side hydroxyl group into the cones changes a few in the solvates,
which can be seen by the presence of a lp(S)···π(ring
F) interaction only in the literature solvate. The pattern of CH···π
contacts is consequently affected, but comparison between the two
structures is not accurate because hydrogens were not positioned in
the solvate form elucidated in 1996.

3 Conclusions
In summary, for the first time, winged cone is reported in the
solid state for calix[6]arene. The structural features derived from
this study match with those suggested in 1992 by Molins et al. in
a solution, except for the cyclic intramolecular hydrogen-bonding
motif. In fact, the asymmetric cone distortion occurs with only two
intramolecular OH···O interactions and neither CW nor
CCW sense is found, even though our theoretical approaches indicate
that an energy lowering could occur if these senses are adopted. A
higher energy in solid state is supported by the energy compensation
from the strong DMSO encapsulation, besides other intermolecular interactions
with DMF and pyridine. This structural exception having three hydrogen-bonding
solvents disagreed with the general conformational trend of calix[6]arenes
in solvatomorphs, highlighting the complexity of the balance between
packing and intramolecular driving forces. However, although this
multiple solvate reveals that this trend cannot be a rule, the second
DMSO solvate form adopting 1,2,3-alternate conformation reinforces
its use as a good approach for the relationship between calix[6]arene
conformation and solvent ability to realize a classical hydrogen bond.
The intriguing DMSO locking into the winged cone is also another important
finding, which will be useful to guide the encapsulation of DMSO-like
molecules into calix[6]arenes.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis and Crystals Preparation
Compound 1 was synthesized according to the known protocol.6,17 Next,
compound 1 was dissolved in very binary and ternary
solvent combinations and then allowed to stand at 25 °C in the
dark. The two successful combinations yielding the new crystal forms
described in this study will be detailed in sequence. A calixarene
mass was weighed (5 mg) and dissolved at room temperature in either
a mixture of DMSO (2 mL) and DMF (2 mL) or a mixture of DMSO (1 mL),
DMF (1 mL), and pyridine (1 mL). After the dissolution step, the glass
crystallizers were not sealed and then kept upon standing for 15–20
days. Before complete solvent evaporation, the crystals of the new
DMSO solvate or the DMSO/DMF/Pyr solvate of 1 were isolated
out from the two solvent systems, respectively, before collecting
the single-crystal X-ray diffraction data.

4.2 Structure
Determination
Suitably
shaped single crystals of the multiple and DMSO solvate forms were
selected for the X-ray diffraction data measurement on a Bruker-AXS
Kappa Duo diffractometer with an APEX II CCD detector. Mo Kα
radiation from an IμS microsource with multilayer optics was
used as the incident X-ray beam. The diffraction images were recorded
by φ and ω scans set using APEX2 software,18 which was also employed to deal with the raw
data sets (indexing, integrating, reducing, and scaling of the Bragg
reflections). Next, the following crystallographic software were used:
SIR200419 (structure solving), SHELXL-9720 (structure refinement), MERCURY,21 and ORTEP-322 (structure
analysis and representations). The asymmetric units were solved through
the assignment of all of the nonhydrogen atoms directly from the Fourier
synthesis of electron density. The electron density map was constructed
by inputting the structure factors whose phases were first retrieved
using the direct methods. After structure solving, the models were
refined by full-matrix least-squares method on F2, with free anisotropic and constrained isotropic atomic displacement
parameters for nonhydrogen and hydrogen atoms, respectively. The Uiso values of hydrogens were set to 1.2Ueq of the bonded carbon, except for methyl hydrogens
in which their Uiso was set to 1.5Ueq of the parent carbon. The hydroxyl hydrogens
had also their Uiso constrained to 1.5Ueq(O). All of the hydrogen positions were stereochemically
defined and constrained in the refinements, keeping idealized geometry
regardless of the changes in the positions of the bonded atoms. However,
all of the OH hydrogens were first identified from the difference
Fourier maps and checked for suitable intra- and intermolecular hydrogen-bonding
geometries before their constraining.

The positional disorder
was possible to be refined for some t-butyl moieties
of both solvates using the classical split-atom approach. Two atomic
sites sets of equal occupancy were found for each t-butyl fraction and then their occupancy was constrained during refinements.
The labels of a disordered site set differed from another corresponding
one by a terminal apostrophe. In the multiple solvate form, sulfur
atom of the DMSO molecule was also disordered over two sites of constrained
70 and 30% occupancy factors.

It is important to mention that
both crystals were extremely thin
plates diffracting X-rays poorly even at a medium-resolution shell.
Furthermore, they have loosened solvent molecules when away from the
crystallization system, undergoing even decrease of the long-range
order (only 26% of the observed reflections for the best X-ray diffraction
data set collected to the new DMSO solvate). In both structures, diffuse
electronic density, identified as low electron density peaks, was
found in the difference Fourier map, which can be from nonstoichiometric
loosing solvent molecules. However, even after several trial refinements
attempting to assign these low electron density peaks to low occupancy
atom sites, the identification of any solvent was not possible and
the data were squeezed using Platon23 before
ending the refinement.

4.3 Theoretical Calculations
All of the
calculations were performed using Gaussian 09.24 The geometries of the single molecules were extracted from
the crystal structures, and several conformations were generated by
exhaustive modifications of the dihedral angles of all of the OH groups.
The C–H coordinates of all of the rotamers were partially optimized
at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory25 while
freezing the internal coordinates of all of the heavy atoms. In addition,
the geometries were fully reoptimized without constraints at the HF/3-21G
level of theory, and normal coordinate analyses were used to confirm
the nature of the stationary points. The most stable geometries found
at the HF/3-21G level were further reoptimized without constrains
at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. To estimate the binding energy
of the 1-DMSO host–guest complex, the geometries
of the complex and of the individual species were extracted from the
crystal structure, and the C–H and O–H coordinates were
optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G* level while freezing the internal coordinates
of all of the heavy atoms.
