Two sensitive and ratiometric fluorescent
probes (probe I and probe
II) were developed for the detection of fluoride ions. Probe I can
detect fluoride ions quantitatively within a range of 0–6 μM
and a detection limit of 73 nM, while probe II has a range of 0–40
μM and a detection limit of 138 nM. The test strips from probe
I are quickly able to recognize F– (5 min) inside
of the F– safety level in drinking water (1.0 mg/L,
∼5 μM) under 254 nm ultraviolet light, and the test strips
from probe II quickly recognize F– (12 min) in dangerously
high F– levels in water (4.0 mg/L, ∼21 μM)
under 254 nm ultraviolet light. This combination of fluorescent paper
sensors from probe I and probe II can be used as a simple and convenient
tool to determine whether water is safe to drink or dangerous.

==== Body
Introduction
The
fluoride anion (F–) is an important trace
element in the human body.1 It carries
both benefits and dangers—a low concentration of F– can be effective in treating osteoporosis and the prevention of
caries, but excess fluoride will cause dental and skeletal fluorosis,
as well as urolithiasis and kidney and gastric disorders.2,3 F– is primarily obtained from food and drinking
water. Most countries set strict limits on F– that
is the permitted level of fluorine in foods.4 In China, these limits are as follows: in eggs and vegetables ≤1.0
mg/kg, fruit ≤0.5 mg/kg, and in meat and freshwater fish ≤2.0
mg/kg.5 Low F– levels
(0.5–1.5 mg/L) in drinking water helps to strengthen bones
and prevent dental caries, and the permitted level of F– in drinking water in China lies at ≤ 1.0 mg/L.6 The content of F– in natural
water is 0.3–0.5 mg/L and can reach 2.0–5.0 mg/L in
groundwater with fluorine ore deposits.7,8 Over 2.0 mg/L
of F– in drinking water can cause damage to kidney
and liver functions and over 4 mg/L will deform human bones and cause
fluorosis.9,10 As a result, developing a simple new, sensitive
and quick method for detecting F– concentrations
is of great importance.11

To date,
several methods have been developed for the detection
of F–, including fluorine reagent colorimetry,12,19 F NMR,13 ion chromatography,14 and the ion-selective electrode.15 However, most approaches dedicated to determining
F– levels are complicated, time-consuming, and expensive
procedures that have limited adaptability.16,17 Recently, fluorescent probes have been highly sensitive, operationally
simple, and quick in the determination of F– in
water, food, cells, and mammals.18−25 Many F– fluorescent probes have been reported
whereby the reaction mechanisms are based on anion−π
interactions,26,27 competitive interactions,28−31 Lewis acid–base interactions,32−34 hydrogen-bonding interactions,35−37 and the F–-induced fracture of Si–O, Si–C,
and P–O bonds.38−44 The F– ratiometric fluorescent probe based on
a F–-induced bond-breaking mechanism is still relatively
uncommon.45−47 As a fluorescent probe with a F–-induced bond-breaking mechanism is highly selective and sensitive,
ratiometric fluorescent probes can reduce interference from environmental
conditions, instrumental efficiency, excitation intensity, and concentration.

In this work, two F– ratiometric fluorescent
probes were developed for the sensitive detection of F– based on the Si–O bond cleavage. The two probes were prepared
with naphthalene–benzothiazole as the fluorophore, tert-butyldimethylsilyl (probe I) and tert-butyldiphenylsilyl (probe II) as the reactive groups, and the Si–O
bond as the reaction site. The two probes have a high sensitivity
and selectivity to F–. The two probes could be used
for the quantitative detection of F– in water. In
addition, the luminescence of probe I test paper will enhance the
F– safety level in drinking water (1 mg/L, ∼5
μM) under a 254 nm ultraviolet light. When the F– content surpasses dangerously high levels (4 mg/L, ∼21 μM),
the luminescence of probe II test paper will enhance under a 254 nm
ultraviolet light. The fluorescent paper sensors can be used as a
simple and convenient tool to check the fluoride ion content in water,
determining whether the water meets drinking standards.

Results and Discussion
Probe
Synthesis
Probes I and II were prepared in a
one-step reaction (Scheme 1) using the nucleophile substitution reaction of 6-hydroxy-2-naphthaldehyde
(compound 1) with chlorosilane (compound 2). The reaction mixture
was then purified using column chromatography to produce probes I
and II; 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS were used
for confirmation (Figures S1–S6, Supporting Information). They are all general operations for organic synthesis.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Probe I and Probe II
Sensing Properties of Probes toward Fluoride Anions
First, the influences of pH and different solvents on the fluorescence
performance of probes I and II were investigated. The pH response
of the probes (10 μM) to F– (300 μM)
was evaluated in different buffers (pH 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 7.4,
8.0, 9.0, 10.0, 11.0, and 12.0) with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, v/v
= 3:1) at 25 °C. The fluorescent intensity of probe I exhibited
irregular change (Figure 1a), and as F– was added, the fluorescent
intensity of probe I did not obviously change (Figure 1b). With an increase in pH from 3 to 12,
the fluorescent intensity of probe II at 416 nm decreased, but increased
at 487 nm (Figure 1c). The fluorescence emission ratio (F416nm/F487nm) of probe II has a linear relation
with different buffers from pH 7.0 to 10.0 (Figure S7, Supporting Information), but as F– was added, the fluorescent intensity of probe II did not seem to
change and exhibited irregular change (Figure 1d). They are almost the same between the
fluorescent intensity of probe II and probe II-F–. It showed that probe II could not identify the F– in these condition.

buffer
solutions (pH, 3–12) with DMSO (v/v = 3:1) at 25 °C; (b)
fluorescent spectra of probe I (10 μM) added to F– (300 μM) in different buffer solutions (pH, 3–12) with
DMSO (v/v = 3:1) at 25 °C; (c) fluorescent spectra of probe II
(10 μM) in different buffer solutions (pH, 3–12) with
DMSO (v/v = 3:1) at 25 °C; (d) fluorescent spectra of probe II
(10 μM) added to F– (300 μM) in different
buffer solutions (pH, 3–12) with DMSO (v/v = 3:1) at 25 °C;
(e) fluorescent spectra of probe I (10 μM) added to F– (300 μM) in different solvents (CH3CN, DMSO, and
C2H5OH) with H2O (v/v = 3:1); (f)
fluorescent spectra of probe II (10 μM) added to F– (300 μM) in different solvents (CH3CN, DMSO, and
C2H5OH) with H2O (v/v = 3:1).

The solvent response of probe
I (10 μM) to F– (300 μM) was evaluated
in different solvents (CH3CN, DMSO, and C2H5OH) with H2O (v/v
= 3:1) (Figure 1e).
The fluorescent intensity of probe I and probe I-F– were almost the same in CH3CN and C2H5OH. The greatest difference in fluorescent intensity between
probe I and probe I-F– occurred in DMSO with H2O (v/v = 3:1). After the F– was added, the
fluorescent intensity decreased rapidly and two fluorescence emission
peaks emerged at 425 and 503 nm. The same phenomenon occurred with
probe II (10 μM)—the greatest testing solvent was DMSO
with H2O (v/v = 3:1). As F– was added,
two fluorescence emission peaks appeared at 416 and 487 nm (Figure 1f). Therefore, DMSO
with H2O (v/v = 3:1) was chosen as the testing solvent
in the following work.

The relationship between the fluorescent
intensity of probe I and
F– concentration was investigated next. As different
concentrations of F– (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 40,
and 60 μM) were added, the fluorescent intensity at 406 nm decreased,
whereas it increased at 512 nm (Figure 2a). Probe I was a ratiometric fluorescent probe. As
the concentrations of F– increased (0, 2, 4, 6,
8, and 10 μM), the luminescent intensity gradually enhanced
and could be observed with the naked eye under 365 nm ultraviolet
light (Figure 2b).
Probe II was also a ratiometric fluorescent probe. As different concentrations
of F– (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 50, 60, 70,
80, 90, and 100 μM) were added, the fluorescent intensity decreased
at 401 nm but increased at 510 nm (Figure 2c). The luminescent intensity of probe II
gradually enhanced after different concentrations of F– (0, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 μM) were added. This could also
be seen with the naked eye under 365 nm ultraviolet light (Figure 2d). Despite adding
more F–, the luminescence of probe II was less obvious
than probe I.

F– (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 40, and 60 μM);

2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 μM) under ambient light and 365 nm UV light;

(d) photograph of probe II solutions (10 μM) subjected to F– (0, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 μM) under ambient
light and 365 nm UV light; (e) time-dependent fluorescence spectra
of probe I (10 μM) in the presence of F– (3
μM) in DMSO with H2O (v/v, 3:1) at 25 °C. Tests
were performed in triplicate; (f) time-dependent fluorescence spectra
of probe II (10 μM) in the presence of F– (20
μM) in DMSO with H2O (v/v, 3:1) at 25 °C. Tests
were performed in triplicate.

A time-response study of the probe to F– was
carried out by monitoring the fluorescence emission ratio. It was
found that the fluorescence emission ratio (F512nm/F406nm) of probe I remained
constant from 0 to 180 s (Figure 2e). The fluorescence emission ratio (F512nm/F406nm) of probe I-F– decreased gradually and reached an equilibrium at
120 s (2 min). Therefore, 2 min was the suitable reaction time for
probe I toward F–. Meanwhile, the fluorescence emission
ratio (F510nm/F401nm) of probe II remained constant from 0 to 30 min (Figure 2f). The fluorescence emission
ratio (F512nm/F406nm) of probe I-F– decreased gradually and reached
an equilibrium at 25 min. As a result, 25 min was the suitable reaction
time for probe II toward F–. The results showed
that the reaction time for probe II-F– was longer
than probe I-F–, which is largely due to the groups
around the silicon atom being different in steric hindrance (phenyl
> methyl).

When F– was gradually added
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
and 6 μM), the fluorescence emission ratio (F510nm/F401nm) of probe I gradually
decreased (Figure 3a). This was linear with the concentration of F– (Figure 3b; R2 = 0.9961) with a detection limit of 73 nM
(S/N = 3).18−20 The fluorescence emission ratio (F512nm/F406nm) of probe II
gradually decreased as different concentrations of F– (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 μM) were added (Figure 3c). The fluorescence
emission ratio (F512nm/F406nm) of probe I was linear with the concentration of
F– (Figure 3d; R2 = 0.9952). The limit of
detection was calculated to be 138 nM (S/N = 3).18−20

To investigate the selectivity of the probes for F–, various competitors including Hcy, Cys, Glu, GSH, H2O2, Cu2+, Ca2+, Na+,
Mg2+, K+, HSO3–, Fe2+, SO42–, HS–, Fe3+, SO32–, Cl–, NH4+, I–, and Br– were tested. None of these competitors caused a fluorescent response
by probe I and probe II. In addition, a competition experiment was
conducted by adding F– to probe solutions containing
these competitors. The fluorescence emission ratio (F510nm/F401nm) of probe I (Figure 4a) and the emission
ratio (F512nm/F406nm) of probe II (Figure 4b) were very close to those of F– alone. The results
show that probe I and probe II are excellent selective tools for F– detection.

were performed in triplicate.

Reaction Mechanism
A possible response mechanism may
contribute to the nucleophile substitution reaction of the probes
with F– generating compound 1, compound 3, or compound
4 (Scheme 2). The reaction
mechanism of probe I with F– was first verified
by 1H NMR titration. The proton signals at 8.52 ppm (a′-H),
1.25 ppm (b′-H), and 0.80 ppm (c′-H) strengthened with
an increase in the concentration of F–. Also, the
signals at 8.51 ppm (a-H), 0.98 ppm (c-H), and 0.25 ppm (b-H) weakened
before disappearing with an increase in the concentration of F– (Figure 5). The mechanism was further confirmed by mass spectrometry (MS),
where a peak at m/z = 278.49 was
observed, which correlates with the formation of compound 1 (Figure
S8, Supporting Information). A peak at m/z = 133.23 correlates with the formation
of compound 3 (Figure S8, Supporting Information). The reaction mechanism of probe II with F– was
first verified by HPLC. As F– equivalent to 1 was
added, the peak of probe II disappeared and the peak of compound 1
appeared (Figure 6).
The mechanism was further confirmed by MS, where a peak at m/z = 278.49 was observed, which correlates
with the formation of compound 1 (Figure S9, Supporting Information). A peak at m/z = 257.79 correlates with the formation of compound 4 (Figure S9, Supporting Information). The results suggest
that the reaction mechanism of the probes with F– arose due to the nucleophile substitution reaction. The reactivity
of probe I and probe II with F– would be affected
by the groups around the silicon atom. As phenyl has a greater electron-donating
ability and steric hindrance than methyl, it would be easy for probe
I to recognize F–.

Scheme 2 Mechanism for Reaction of Probe I and Probe II with F–
Detection of F– in Real Samples
All
of the above results showed that probe I and probe II had a good response
to F– in complex systems. The ability of probe II
to detect F– in real samples was demonstrated in
order to prove its applicability. Five kinds of real samples (tap
water, yellow river, mineral water, green tea, and milk; 20 μL)
were added to probe II solutions (10 μM, 2.0 mL). The concentration
of F– were detected in the five real samples (Table 1). Then, different
amounts of F– (15 and 30 μM) were added. The
recovery values from 97.92 to 104.59% show that probe II is able to
detect F– in real water samples. As probe I has
similar characteristics to probe II, probe I could be expected to
detect concentrations of F– in real samples.

Application in Test Strips
The test strips PI-A were
placed on a glass plate, and 10 μL of different concentrations
of F– (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 μM) were added.
After 5 min, the luminescence of test strips PI-A clearly enhanced
the F– safety level of drinking water (1.0 mg/L,
∼5 μM). This could be observed with the naked eye under
254 nm ultraviolet light (Figure 7a).

and 254 nm

to F– (0, 3, 6, 13, 21, and 27 μM) under ambient

to F– (0, 3, 6, 13, 21, and 27 μM) under ambient
light and 365 nm UV light.

The test strips of PI-B were placed on a glass plate, and
20 μL
of different concentrations of F– (0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, and 6 μM) were added. After 60 min, the luminescence of the
test strips PI-B clearly enhanced the F– safety
level of drinking water (1.0 mg/L, ∼5 μM) under 254 nm
ultraviolet light (Figure 7b).

The test strips of PII were placed on a glass plate,
and 20 μL
of different concentrations of F– (0, 3, 6, 13,
21, and 27 μM) were added. After 12 min, the luminescence of
the test strips PII had obviously enhanced as the F– content exceeds dangerously high levels (4 mg/L, ∼21 μM)
under 254 nm (Figure 7c) and 365 nm (Figure 7d) ultraviolet light.

All these results indicate that the test
strips of probe I and
probe II can be used as a simple and convenient tool to check the
fluoride ion content in water, determining whether the water can be
drunk.

Although many F– fluorescent probes
have been
reported (Table S1, Supporting Information), no F– fluorescent test strip probe can recognize
F– in a 1.0 mg/L concentration quickly. The fluorescent
paper sensors developed in this work can be used as a simple and convenient
tool to check the fluoride ion content in water, determining whether
the water is of drinking standard.

Conclusions
In
summary, two ratiometric fluorescent probes (probe I and probe
II) were developed for the detection of F–. The
function of the probes relies on the nucleophile substitution reaction
of the probes with F–, which generates 6-hydroxy-2-naphthaldehyde,
as verified by 1H NMR, HPLC, and MS. The test strips of
probe I quickly recognize F– (5 min) in the F– safety level in drinking water (1.0 mg/L, ∼5
μM) under 254 nm ultraviolet light, and the test strips of probe
II quickly recognize F– (12 min) in the F– dangerously high levels in water (4.0 mg/L, ∼21 μM)
under 254 nm ultraviolet light. The fluorescent paper sensors of probe
I and probe II can be used as a simple and convenient tool to check
the fluoride ion content in water, determining whether the water is
safe to drink or if the water is dangerous.

MgSO4, FeS, KI, FeS, NaHSO3, and NH4Cl were dissolved in distilled water to obtained 10 mM aqueous solutions.
Various concentrations could be obtained by diluting these stock solutions
with distilled water.

Procedures of Fluoride Anion Determination
Preparation
of the test system: 0.02 mL probe solution was added to a cuvette.
Then, acetonitrile was poured into the cuvette to make up a volume
of 2 mL. Finally, the ion solution was added. After waiting 5 min,
it was mixed completely. Samples of the mixture were analyzed in the
fluorescence spectrometer using the conditions of λex = 342 nm (probe I), λex = 338 nm (probe II); temperature
= 25 °C; voltage = 500 V; and slit widths = 2.5, 2.5 nm.

Preparation
of Test Strips
The test strips PI-A of
probe I were prepared using waterman filter paper (1 cm × 1 cm
pieces). The test strips PI-A of probe I were prepared by dropping
a 10 μL DMSO solution of probe I (10 μM) onto the filter
paper and then baking for 5 min in an oven at 70 °C.

The
test strips PI-B of probe I were prepared by dropping 20 μL
of the DMSO solution of probe I (10 μM) onto the filter paper
and then air-drying for 10 min.

The test strips PII of probe
II were prepared by dropping 20 μL
of the DMSO solution of probe II (10 μM) onto the filter paper
and then air-drying for 5 min.
