The present finding
deals with a simple and low-cost fabrication
of surface-passivated, brightly fluorescent zinc-oxide-decorated,
red-emitting excitation-independent ultrafluorescent CDs, denoted
as “CZnO-Dots”. Surface doping of zinc oxide
significantly improved the quantum yield by up to ∼72%, and
these brightly fluorescent red-emitting CZnO-Dots have
been employed for the aqueous-phase photoreduction of 100 ppm hexavalent
chromium(VI) to trivalent chromium(III) under the influence of sunlight
irradiation. The overall utility of the prepared CZnO-Dots
can be ascertained by their recyclability over seven cycles.

Introduction
Since their discovery, carbon-based fluorescent
materials as carbon
dots (CDs)1 and graphene quantum dots (GQDs)2 have been explored a lot because of their wide
range in the applicative sustainability.3−6 Their biocompatibility with higher values
of quantum yield7 has made CDs/GQDs significantly
better candidates when compared with the long-known quantum dots (QDs),
especially in the field of bioimaging applications.4,8 However,
at present, they are facing a few issues because of the emissive profiles
situated in the narrower region of the visible spectrum (in between
the blue and green regions).4,5,8 A limited number of reports state that their emission lies in the
higher wavelength region [red and near-infrared (NIR) regions].9−13 The energy associated with the red and NIR regions of the spectrum
is less, which can directly relate to them being lesser harmful to
biological systems.14,15 Work is already in progress for
the fabrication of red-emitting CDs/GQDs with higher quantum yield
via the hydrothermal,16,17 solvothermal,11,18 and microwave12,19,20 methods using different precursors such as carbon9,11−13,16,18−21 and the heteroatoms22 (as the dopant
material) to achieve red-imaging.12,16 Sun et al.
report the synthesis of metal-doped green fluorescent ZnO and ZnS-doped/-decorated
CD by the doping of zinc acetate on the surface of CD via hydrolysis
by NaOH and precipitation with Na2S, respectively.23 Cheng et al. report the synthesis of yellow
fluorescent CZnO-Dots via a one-step hydrothermal synthesis
by mixing citric acid and zinc chloride in toluene and used them in
bifunctional photonic crystal films, fluorescent microfibers, and
patterns.24 Xu et al. synthesized blue-light-emitting
CZnO-Dots by mixing sodium citrate and zinc chloride via
the hydrothermal method and used them as a biosensor.25 ZnO/graphene quasi-core shell QDs were synthesized by Son
et al., who used them in white-light-emitting diodes.26 Apart from the above-mentioned applications, CD and doped
CD are used in the field of sensing (gas,27 heavy metals,28−30 microbes,31,32 etc.), optical displays,33 tunable photoluminescence,4,34 biocompatibility,33 and competitive quantum yield values7 and in the field of bioimaging (presently being
explored in the red and NIR regions).9−13 Based on their vast levels of applicative sustainability
CDs/doped CDs can be expected to show their potential toward world’s
most serious concern, that is, contamination of water35 which increases at a very high rate because of the increase
in world population and industrialization. A huge amount of wastewater
is discharged routinely which contains a large amount of heavy inorganic
metal ions and organic compounds generally known as dyes that subsequently
degraded the overall environmental and human health. Few reports are
available for the photodegradation of the organic dyes by the waste
derived nano-carbons.36−39 The removal of heavy metals from wastewater has been carried out
by different techniques.40−44 Red-emitting CDs can be a significant material, simply because of
their lower working levels of energy which can be used for the applications
related to water treatment.

Under the influence of sunlight,
the present work describes a new
prospect of using red-emitting CZnO-Dots apart from their
routine applications. Concerning its successful usage for the aqueous-phase
photoreduction of 100 ppm of Cr(VI) in dichromate water. The as-obtained
CZnO-Dots showed excellent solubility and stability in
aqueous media along with excellent photostability and exhibited excitation-independent
red emissions with high quantum yields (∼50%). The most significant
prospect of the present finding is the utilization of CZnO-Dots as a novel photocatalyst material for the aqueous-phase photo-reduction
of 100 ppm hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)].

Results and Discussion
The simple methodology illustrated in Scheme 1 presents a low-cost fabrication approach
for the synthesis of surface-passivated, brightly fluorescent zinc-oxide-decorated,
red-emitting CZnO-Dots showing excitation-independent
red emission at ∼661 nm, with excellent photostability and
high quantum yield.

Photoreduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), Under the Influence of Sunlight
Microscopic Analysis
The morphology
of CZnO-Dots was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) and
high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). Figure 1a shows the TEM image of CZnO-Dots with
well-dispersed particles. Inset of Figure 1a shows the photographic image of CZnO-Dots. The average size of CZnO-Dots is ∼2–6
nm as observed from the size distribution shown in Figure 1b. Figure 1c displays the HRTEM image of CZnO-Dots showing the presence of graphitic dots of different shapes
and sizes (red circles), and the inset of Figure 1c shows the selected-area diffraction pattern
(SAED), confirming the polycrystalline characteristic of the sample. Figure 1d shows the powder
X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum of CZnO-Dots, confirming
the doping of zinc in CZnO-Dots. The 2θ at 27.6°,
30°, 33.04°, 39.6°, 43.36°, and 44.94° is
compared with the JCPDS of PDF card number 00-021-1486 for ZnO and
that at 23.8° for graphitic carbon.

UV–Visible Absorption and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
(XPS) Analysis
The absorption spectrum of CZnO-Dots versus the control sample (without ZnO-doped) is shown in Figure 2a. Both the CZnO-Dots and the control samples showed almost similar absorption
characteristics except for an increase in the absorption peak intensities
at their respective wavelengths. As observed, the CZnO-Dots
exhibited a higher absorption intensity compared to the control samples
(the hyperchromic effect), and the highest intensity peak at 430 nm
corresponds to n−π* compared to other peaks. The inset
of Figure 2a shows
the photographic image of the control samples, and CZnO-Dots in daylight clearly show the changes in the color of the solution
after the doping of Zn. The shift toward the lower wavelength and
higher intensity of absorption peaks supports the doping of ZnO within
the carbogenic surface of the control sample to yield highly emissive
red-emitting CZnO-Dots. The surface attachment of the zinc
material as a dopant CZnO-Dot was investigated by the XPS
analysis, as described in Figure 2b–e. The XPS survey scan shows the peaks at
284.8, 532.8, 1024, and 1045 eV associated with the presence of C1s (81.0%), O1s (13.4%), and Zn2p (5.6%),
as displayed in Figure 2b, confirming the existence of C, O, and Zn, within the CZnO-Dots. Moreover, the high-resolution XPS spectra over the deconvolution
showed the presence of different binding sites for C, Zn, and O, as
displayed in Figure 2c–e. The high-resolution XPS short scan of C1s deconvolution
displayed several C-binding sites at 282.6 (C–Zn), 283.6 (C=C),
284.5 (C–C), 285.2 (C–O), 286.1 (C=O), and 288.4
eV (COO–)45,46 (Figure 2c). The short scans of Zn are shown in Figure 2d. Similarly, for
the O1s deconvolution, different binding sites for C and
Zn are shown in Figure 2e at 529.5 (O–Zn), 530.9 (C–O), 531.8 (C=O),
and 532.9 eV (COO–).47

Figure 3 shows
the
optical property of CZnO-Dots via fluorescence spectroscopy. Figure 3a shows almost similar
characteristic fluorescence spectra for CZnO-Dots and the
control sample. The CZnO-Dots exhibited a relatively higher
fluorescent intensity with a slight blue shift (∼17 nm) in
the fluorescence spectra compared to the control. The emissive fluorescence
spectra are in accordance with the observations noticed in the absorption
studies (Figure 2a).
The brightly fluorescent and prominent aspect concerning the excitation-independent
red-emitting CZnO-Dots is shown in Figure 3b. The inset of Figure 3b displays the photographic image of CZnO-Dots under UV light illumination. Regarding the excitation-independent
red emission of CZnO-Dots can be explained based on documented
reports ascribed because of the incorporation/doping of heteroatoms.48,49Figure 3c displays
the optical fluorescence microscopy image of CZnO-Dots
with a 562 nm band-pass filter, and Figure 3d shows the excellent photostability of CZnO-Dots toward a photobleaching experiment performed for 5
h at continuous irradiation with excitation at 430 nm. The quantum
yield of the as-prepared CZnO-Dots was ∼50% (compared to Nile
blue), and this can be increased up to ∼72% by centrifuging
it on high rpm (11 000) for the isolation of most fluorescent
fraction. All the photoreduction experiments were carried out by using
the as prepared CZnO-Dots.

CZnO-Dots in Photocatalytic Reduction
of Cr(VI) to
Cr(III)
The sunlight-induced photocatalytic activity of CZnO-Dots was assessed for the aqueous-phase photoreduction
of the toxic Cr(VI). The continuous decrease in the concentrations
of Cr(VI) ( in terms of C/C0) as shown in Figure 4a under the influence of sunlight was determined by the absorption
analysis at the 540 nm wavelength by following the 1,5-diphenyl carbazide
(DPC) assay.43 Prior to the photoreduction
experiment, 3 mg mL–1 of CZnO-Dots was
mixed in a 100 ppm Cr(VI) stock solution and stirred continuously
in the dark for 30 min, to achieve the adsorption–desorption
equilibrium. The adsorption data (Figure 4a) for CZnO-Dots in the dark (black
line) and sunlight (red line) including the control (blue line) showed
that only 27% of Cr(VI) reduction was achieved in the 300 min dark
condition. Moreover, the photocatalytic influence of sunlight in the
presence of CZnO-Dots showed the highest reduction of Cr(VI)
(∼99%) in 300 min, which was 75.7% higher as compared to the
control sample. The increase in photoreduction efficiency for CZnO-Dots could be attributed to the high catalytic activity
of ZnO that facilitates the reduction in recombination of photogenerated
charge carriers.50 Moreover, another plausible
reason for the high photocatalytic activity of CZnO-Dots
for Cr(VI) reduction is ascribed to their high adsorption values.
CZnO-Dots showed a higher Cr(VI) adsorption efficiency
(∼25%, red line) compared to that of the control (∼8%,
blue line), as shown in Figure 4a, which can significantly enhance the availability of Cr(VI)
at the active sites of the used catalyst material as CZnO-Dots. During the process of photocatalysis, the photogenerated electrons
from the photocatalyst can readily access surface-adsorbed Cr(VI)
ions and thereby stimulate the reduction process [reduce Cr(VI) to
Cr(III)].51,52

conditions; the inset of (a) shows the comparative data of first-order
rate constant and correlation coefficient obtained from fitting the
experimental data; and (b) the final concentration of Cr(VI) and Cr(VI

Cr(VI) concentrations based on UV−vis and AAS analyses. (c)
UV−vis absorption spectra and (d) Tauc plots of (αhυ)2 vs photo energy (hυ) of CZnO-Dots in the dark and sunlight-exposed
samples.

The experimental data are well-fitted
with a first-order kinetic
model, and the rate constant values as well as the correlation coefficient
are shown in the inset of Figure 4a. However, the experimental data do not fit well with
the zero-order and second-order models. Figure 4b shows the percentage of Cr(VI) and Cr(VI
+ III) remaining in the aqueous phase after the photoreduction process
at different initial Cr(VI) concentrations (10, 20, 50, and 100 ppm)
as determined from UV–vis and atomic absorption spectroscopy
(AAS) analyses, respectively. To further investigate the influence
of sunlight irradiation on CZnO-Dots, the change in the
band gap value was analyzed by using the UV–vis diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy compared to that in the dark.53−55Figure 4c shows the absorption edge
near ∼661 nm, which corresponds to the band gap of CZnO-Dots. Figure 4d shows
the Tauc’s plot [(αhυ)2 vs hυ];56 the
band gap for CZnO-Dots was 1.54 eV while their values decreased
to 1.43 eV when sensitized with sunlight. The results show that the
band gap energy decreases and particularly shifts toward an efficient
visible light range that enhanced the photocatalysis process for Cr(VI)
reduction. The high rate constant values under sunlight irradiation
as discussed earlier (Figure 4a) are consistent with the experimental observation based
on diffuse reflectance. Furthermore, the effects of percentage (%)
doping and the amount of photocatalyst (CZnO-Dots) loading
had been studied to understand their effects on the rate of photoreduction.
A separate study was performed by varying the experimental conditions
related to the percentage doping of zinc (Figure 5a) and the amount of catalyst (Figure 5b). The results are shown in Figure 5, which illustrates
that the maximum photoreduction [100 ppm Cr(VI)] under the influence
of sunlight was obtained at 3 mg/mL amount of CZnO-Dots
when they were doped with 10 wt % Zn salt as a dopant. Thus, it was
inferred that the introduction of ZnO as a dopant can significantly
improve the catalytic activity of CZnO-Dots and play a
vital role in the photoreduction reaction on the catalyst surface.

Photocatalytic Mechanism
for Photoreduction
Figure 6a shows the plausible
mechanism based on the experimental results. The electrons and holes
in CZnO-Dots could be generated under sunlight illumination,
as shown in equation (i). Then, the photogenerated hole in the valence
band produced O2 and H+ as a result of reduction
of H2O, as shown in equation (ii).57 Afterward, the photogenerated electrons and H+ approach
Cr(VI) present in the surrounding of CZnO-Dots, for the
photoreduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) as shown in equation (iii). Certainly,
as expected, the solubility is enhanced because of the presence of
defects in CZnO-Dots, which plays a critical role in the
photoreduction process in approaching Cr(VI) to the active site of
the CZnO-Dot surface for the redox reaction. The valance
state transformation of Cr or photoreduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)
under the influence of sunlight irradiation using CZnO-Dots
was supported by a cyclic voltammetry (CV) study. The CV data presented
in Figure 6b showed
the cyclic voltammograms for the control and CZnO-Dots
samples. The CZnO-Dots accelerate Cr(VI) to Cr(III) reduction
under sunlight as observed from the increase in the peak’s
current at ∼ −0.11 V, however, such reduction did not
occur under the dark condition. The increase in peaks current attributes
to the decomposition of Cr2O7−2 which normally did not occur, at such a low potential, but CZnO-Dots under conjugation may tune and enhance the overall
process. On the other side in the case of the control sample (without
doping) very insignificant reduction current occurred even under the
influence of sunlight. The appearance of a single peak, broad in nature
confirmed that the said reduction is a complex process for which a
detailed electrochemical study is planned in the future. The reusability
and stability of CZnO-Dots were also studied under sunlight
irradiation, as shown in Figure 6c. The results indicate that the CZnO-Dots
photocatalyst is stable up to seven cycles with the efficiency more
than 90%.

Conclusions
The doped CD with inorganic
salts can apparently form a newer platform
among the existing class of fluorescent optical materials such as
QDs and organic dyes. The doped-soluble CD with a higher quantum yield
value can provide solutions to many newer emerging and existing problems.
The aqueous solutions of red-emitting brightly fluorescent CZnO-Dots with excellent photostability could compete with the already
existing commercially available QDs and organic dyes for similar types
of applications. Such as related to the deeper penetration ability
of the fluorescent probe could directly relate the excellence of instructive
image analysis. Beyond these, brightly fluorescent CZnO-Dots do have the potential for use as an excellent photocatalytic
material because of their working window, which is situated in the
lower wavelength region. Interestingly, further studies could reveal
a vast prospective future of these soluble brightly fluorescent CZnO-Dots in the field of photocatalysis and water treatment.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Reagents
All chemical reagents were of
analytical grade, procured from Merck
India, and used without further purification.

Instrumentation
TEM and HRTEM (Tecnai 20 G2 300 kV,
STWIN model) were used for analyzing the internal characterization
of the CZnO-Dots. The sonicated sample was dropped on a
carbon-coated Cu grid (400 mesh size).

Optical spectroscopy:
The UV–vis absorption spectra (PerkinElmer Lambda 35 spectrometer)
were analyzed at room temperature.

Spectroscopy: XPS measurements
were recorded on an ESCA+ omicron nanotechnology Oxford
instrument.

Photoluminescence spectrometry (PerkinElmer LS55
spectrophotometer)
analyses in aqueous solutions were conducted at 28 ± 1 °C
(room temperature).

Fluorescence microscopy: Red-emitting particle
images were obtained
by fluorescence microscopy (Leica DC200, Leica microscopy system Ltd,
CH-9435, Heerbrugg equipped using 561 nm band-pass filters) and supported
with an RS Photometrics Sensys camera, KAF1401E G1, for image capturing.

Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (PerkinElmer Lambda 35 spectrometer):
the sample was prepared in sunlight and dark for 24 h, after which
it was dried on a water bath, and the dried sample was used for the
analysis.

CV: the CV studies (K-Lyte 1.2 model of Kanopy Techno
Solution
Pvt. Ltd.) were performed using a three-electrode cell in sunlight;
a glassy carbon electrode was used as the working electrode, Pt wire
and Ag/AgCl (in 0.1 M KCl) electrodes were used as counter and reference
electrodes, respectively. The scan rate was 10 mV/sec and the resting
potential has been 1.15 V to start the scan to sweep till -0.8V maintaining
the scan window between +1.15 V to −0.8V (vs Ag/AgCl) using
0.1M KCl as supporting electrolyte. 100 ppm potassium dichromate as
probe was added with the photocatalyst.

Synthesis of CZnO-Dots
CZnO-Dots
were synthesized using bougainvillea plant leaves as pristine materials
via the green synthesis process. Prior to use, the leaves were cleaned
with deionized (DI) water to remove soluble impurities and were dried
at ∼30 °C. Next, an extract of leaves was obtained by
blending the chopped leaves (∼1 cm-sized pieces) using a hand
blender. After this, the extract (∼10 g) was mixed in 100 mL
of ethanol/water mixture [(1:1) (V/V)] solution. Zinc acetate by the
10 wt % of the extract was added into the solution and sonicated for
another 10 min. The final mixture was then carbonized at 90% power
of a domestic microwave oven of 1400 W for 10 min. The mixture was
collected and centrifuged at ∼6000 rpm for 30 min. The residual
supernatant solution was transferred to a Petri dish and dried on
a water bath. The dried powder was named as red color-emitting zinc-oxide-doped
CDs (CZnO-Dots). The quantum yield was measured7 for both the samples, as prepared and highly
centrifuged sample separated 11 000 rpm centrifuge with reference
to Nile blue.58,59 The photographic image was taken
in the ethanol:water (1:1) solution as shown in the inset of Figure 2b.12 A control sample without zinc doping was prepared under
conditions similar to those for CZnO-Dots from the same
plant leaves.

Photocatalytic Activity Measurement
The photocatalytic
activity of the CZnO-Dot samples was determined by the
photoreduction of Cr(VI) in aqueous dichromate solution under direct
sunlight. A stock solution of potassium dichromate containing 100
ppm of Cr(VI) was prepared in DI water for photocatalytic reduction,
1.414 g wt of potassium dichromate was dissolved in 250 mL DI water
to make 1000 ppm of Cr(VI), and further concentrations were made by
dilution. In a typical process, 150 mg of CZnO-Dots was
added in 50 mL of the prepared Cr(VI) solution and was stirred for
30 min in the dark to attain the adsorption/desorption equilibration.
The solutions were then exposed to direct sunlight. During the photocatalytic
test, a fixed amount of the photoreacted solution was collected at
a fixed time interval of 30 min. The collected solution was centrifuged,
and the supernatant solution was analyzed for the concentration of
Cr(VI), and a pink color was obtained on mixing with the standard
DPC assay.60
