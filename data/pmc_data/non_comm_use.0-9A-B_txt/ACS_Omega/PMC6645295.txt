A method for conversion
of furfural, widely available platform
chemical from biomass, to ethylcyclopentane, is reported. Ethylcyclopentane
is a cyclic alkane with a relatively high octane number (RON 67, bp
103 °C) and could potentially serve as a drop-in biofuel. The
synthetic route includes a transformation of furfural to 1-(furan-2-yl)propan-1-ol
that is further subjected to Piancatelli rearrangement to give 5-ethyl-4-hydroxycyclopent-2-en-1-one.
The subsequent hydrodeoxygenation affords ethylcyclopentane in 48%
isolated yield.

Introduction
To achieve liquid transportation,
fuels from biomass have been
an intense research object in recent years.1−6 Among the various routes studied, conversion of bio-derived furanes
to alkanes has received significant attention.7−13 One of the key steps for obtaining alkanes from furanes is total
hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), and a number of different catalysts, including
lanthanide triflates,10−13 have recently been developed14 for this
transformation. Most of the reported methods provide linear or lowly
branched alkanes that have low research octane numbers (RON). Synthesis
of cyclic alkanes, which have higher RON numbers, requires different
approach. One possibility is to apply the Piancatelli rearrangement,15,16 which allows the transformation of 2-furylcarbinols (including furfuryl
alcohol) into substituted cyclopentenones. Cyclopentenones are an
important scaffold for the synthesis of a variety of biologically
active target molecules17,18 and therefore the Piancatelli
rearrangement has been extensively studied. Recent advances in this
field include a use of new catalytic systems,19−21 microwave irradiation,22 and an aza version of this rearrangement.23−28 In addition, this transformation has been applied to achieve one-step
conversion of furfural to cyclopentanone29,30 in high yield. Cyclopentanone is an important intermediate in biofuel
production and it can be reduced to cyclopentane (Ru/ZSM-5, 4 MPa
H2, 180 °C).30 Furthermore,
the product of self-condensation of cyclopentanone can be hydrodeoxygenated
to bicyclopentane (Pd–SiO2 or Ni–SiO2-DP, 6 MPa H2, 230 °C),30−33 which is a perspective jet range
biofuel (Scheme 1a).

In contrast to furfuryl alcohol, HMF does not undergo Piancatelli
rearrangement under normal conditions. However, recently, Ohyama has
reported a direct transformation of HMF to 3-hydroxymethyl-cyclopentanone
using hydrogenative conditions (3–8 MPa H2, 140
°C) in combination with lanthanide metal oxide catalysts (Scheme 1b).34−36 In addition, 3-methyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one was formed in a low yield
during the reduction of HMF with Zn.37 HDO
of these cyclopentane skeleton containing compounds, obtained from
HMF, could afford methylcyclopentane (MCP), which can also serve as
a bio-based drop-in gasoline substituent.

A different approach
to access MCP was recently described by Bell
et al.38 In this procedure MCP was obtained
by self-condensation of 2,5-hexanedione and subsequent HDO (Pt/NbOPO4, 3.0 MPa H2, 150 °C) of resulting 3-methylcyclopent-2-enone.
In addition, MCP is forming as a low-yield byproduct during HDO of
cellulose,39 sorbitol,40 and guaiacol41 to alkanes.

However, to the best of our knowledge ethylcyclopentane is a completely
new compound for application as biofuel. It has the boiling point
of 103 °C and relatively high octane number (RON 67),42 making it a potential drop-in biofuel. In this
study, we report a route for obtaining ethylcyclopentane from furfural,
which includes addition of ethyl group to furfural, Piancatelli rearrangement,
and subsequent HDO of obtained cyclopentenone 3 (Scheme 1c).

Scheme 1 Various
Synthetic Strategies toward Cyclopentanic Alkanes from Furanes
Results and Discussion
Furfural (1) was easily converted to 1-(furan-2-yl)propan-1-ol
(2) in 96% yield using ethylmagnesium bromide (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of 1-(Furan-2-yl)propan-1-ol
Addition of ethylmagnesium
halide to furfural is a known reaction,43 and this step is somewhat problematic in large
scale because of the stoichiometric amount of Grignard reagent. However,
our route not only introduces the ethyl group but also the OH
group, which is necessary for the subsequent Piancatelli
rearrangement. Also, ethylmagnesium bromide is a widely available
reagent potentially obtainable directly from ethanol or via bioethylene.
To minimize the amount of used solvents, furfural was added neat to
the EtMgBr in MTHF and the product was isolated without any chromatography.
In addition, magnesium halides, which are formed in the work-up process,
could be used as de-icing reagents on roads (MgCl2) or for the production of magnesium.

Next, the obtained
alcohol 2 was subjected to
Piancatelli rearrangement and the reaction conditions were optimized
(Table 1). Recently,
methods for performing Piancatelli rearrangement of alkyl-substituted
furyl carbinols in water were described.22,44,45 However, in these reactions, the yield of
target compounds was relatively low and 4-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopent-2-en-1-one
was obtained in pure boiling water44 in
40% yield. Addition of MgSO4 as the catalyst at 160
°C increased to yield to 56%.45 In addition, Reiser has described the method for Piancatelli rearrangement
of compound 2 in water using microwave irradiation in
54% yield. On the other hand, a recent work of Read de Alaniz suggests
that alkyl-substituted furyl carbinols can be transformed to cyclopentenones
in up to 90% yield.19 In this study, however,
the yield of the product varied greatly depending of the alkyl substituent
used (90% for butyl, but 56% for iso-propyl). Thus, we have decided
to use this work as a starting point for the optimization of conditions
for our furfuryl alcohol 2. In our hands, the use of
5 mol % trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) together with 10 mol % of Dy(OTf)3 in t-BuOH/water (5:1) system resulted in
relatively low yield and incomplete conversion (Table 1, entry 1). The use of La(OTf)3 instead of Dy(OTf)3 gave no improvement (entry 2). Increasing
the reaction time to 48 h afforded cyclopentenone 3 in
51% yield (entry 3). Further increase of the temperature and catalytic
loading resulted in nearly the same result in 24 h (50%, entry 4).
The use of other solvent systems (AcOH/water 5:1 and AcCN/water 5:1)
mainly led to a complex mixture of byproducts (data not shown).

b Reaction was performed
in pure distilled
water.

In addition, the
reaction in the t-BuOH/water
system in the absence of the lanthanide catalyst using correspondingly
5, 10, and 20 mol % of TFA was studied. Generally, longer reaction
time and higher catalyst loading afforded higher product yields. The
best result was achieved using 20 mol % of TFA (47% yield, entry 5).
Amberlyst-15 as a catalyst was also tested; however, it led to the
formation of byproducts and only a minor amount of target cyclopentenone
was observed. The byproducts are formed mainly through the elimination
reaction and Friedel–Crafts alkylation.

Because the use
of lanthanide or acid catalyst furnished the yields
not exceeding 51%, we applied a modified procedure that was previously
reported by Frelek et al.44 for obtaining
the compound 3 (entry 6). This reaction proceeded in
pure boiling water in relatively concentrated fashion (6.8 g of 2 in 170 mL H2O) without any added catalyst. Moreover,
our modification allowed separating the product in pure form, without
using any chromatography in 51% yield. Considering the simplicity
and avoidance of relatively expensive lanthanide catalysts makes this
procedure (entry 6) superior to the other methods described in Table 1.

Next, HDO
of cyclopentenone 3 using the La(OTf)3 catalyst
in combination with Pd catalyst and H2 gas was explored
(Table 2). At 20 bar
H2 (34 bar at 200 °C), the use
of 0.5 mol % Pd catalyst resulted in ethylcyclopenanone as the main
product (entry 1). At the same time, the use of 1.6 mol % Pd afforded
a complex mixture of products, where only traces of desired ethylcyclopentane
(4) was detected (entry 2). Increasing the hydrogen pressure
to 40 bar (64 bar at 200 °C) afforded 19% of desired product
(entry 3). An exchange of the solvent to EtOAc increased the yield
of 4 to 56% (entry 4). Applying the same conditions on
a larger scale resulted in the formation of ethylcyclopentane in a
high yield (85%, entry 5). The use of Dy(OTf)3 afforded
the product in even higer yield (94%, entry 6). The attempt to reuse
the catalytic system (after evaporation of solvents) gave roughly
15% lower yield compared with the first use; however, no special procedures
for restoring the catalytic activity were applied.

Taking into account the high efficiency achieved in
the HDO reaction,
an attempt to combine Piancatelli rearrangement and the HDO steps
was made. Thus, a crude reaction mixture from Piancatelli rearrangement
(10 mol % La(OTf)3, 10 mol % TFA, 90 °C, 24 h) was
concentrated, dissolved in an EtOAc or AcOH, and after the addition
of another 5 mol % of La(OTf)3 and Pd/C, was subjected
to HDO. However, assuming that efficiency of Piancatelli rearrangement
step was about 50%, in both cases (Table 2, entries 7 and 8), the yields over two steps
were nearly half of expected. An analogous two-step reaction was performed
using Dy(OTf)3 (entry 9). After the first step (10 mol
% Dy(OTf)3, 10 mol % TFA, 90 °C, 24 h), the reaction
mixture was evaporated, and ethyl acetate (15 mL) followed by Pd/C
was added. This time the yield was slightly better (entry 8 vs entry
9), but still remained below the expectations.

In addition,
to isolate the target compound 4 in pure
form, HDO of 3 was performed in solvent-free conditions
(Table 2, entry 10).
As a result, the pure 4 was isolated in 48% yield.

Conclusion
A three-step route for obtaining ethylcyclopentane from biomass-derived
furfural is described. Transformation of furfural to 1-(furan-2-yl)propan-1-ol
(2) and HDO of 3 proceeds in excellent yield
(96 and 94% correspondingly), thus making the Piancatelli rearrangement
a limiting step. Scope and limitations of the route are discussed.

1-(Furan-2-yl)propan-1-ol
(2)
A 100 mL
round-bottom flask was charged with EtMgBr solution in MeTHF
(3.056 M, 33 mL, 100 mmol), cooled to 0 °C, and then neat furfural
(9.608 g, 100 mmol) was added dropwise in 15–30 min. The resulting
thick suspension was diluted with dry THF (10 mL). Then, the cooling
bath was removed and the reaction mixture was allowed to stir for
2 h at rt. After this, the reaction mixture was quenched with water
(3 × 10 mL). NB. The mixture heats up strongly. After cooling,
the resulting thick suspension was transferred to a separation funnel
and partitioned between Et2O (100 mL) and hydrochloric
acid (aq) (1 M, 100 mL). The organic fraction was separated and the
water fraction was additionally extracted with Et2O (2
× 100 mL). Organic fractions were combined, dried with MgSO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product
was diluted with a mixture of PE and diethyl ether (1:1, 30 mL), filtered
through a short plug of silica gel, and evaporated again to give a
product (12.107 g, 96%) as yellowish oil. 1H NMR (400 MHz,

Procedure A
A round-bottom flask
(250 mL) was
charged with 1-(furan-2-yl)propan-1-ol (2) (1.262 g,
10 mmol), and t-BuOH (70 mL), water (14 mL), Dy(OTf)3 (600 mg, 10 mol %), and TFA (80 μL, 10 mol %) were
added. The reaction mixture was stirred at rt for 5 min to obtain
homogeneous solution. After this, the flask was equipped with a condenser,
placed in a preheated (90 °C) oil bath, and stirred for 24 h.
Then, the reaction mixture was cooled down and transferred to a separation
funnel and partitioned between Et2O (70 mL) and a
mixture of aqueous solutions of NaCl (sat., 50 mL) and NaHCO3 (sat., 20 mL). The organic layer was separated and aqueous fraction
was additionally extracted with Et2O (1 × 70 mL).
Organic fractions were combined, concentrated, and purified with column
chromatography (PE/Et2O 1:3) to give the desired compound
(628 mg, 50%) as yellowish oil. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.49 (dd, J = 5.8, 2.2 Hz, 1H),

Procedure
B
A round-bottom flask (250 mL) was charged
with distilled water (170 mL) and equipped with a reflux condenser
and a magnetic stirring bar. Then, the flask was placed on a preheated
oil bath (120 °C), water brought to boiling, and then 1-(furan-2-yl)propan-1-ol
(2) (1.7 g, 13.5 mmol) was added. The addition was repeated
three times more every 20 min (6.8 g, 54 mmol in total). The mixture
was stirred with heating for additional 3 h and then allowed to cool
down to rt. The resulting heterogenic mixture was transferred to the
separation funnel and washed first with PE (4 × 20 mL) and then
with the mixture of PE and Et2O (1:1, 2 × 15 mL) to
remove byproducts. These organic extracts contained mostly byproducts
and therefore were discarded. Subsequent addition of solid NaCl (51
g) to the aqueous phase has triggered an additional separation of
yellow organic phase (∼3 mL). The organic phase was separated
and remaining completely clear and colorless water solution was extracted
with EtOAc (4 × 60 mL). Ethyl acetate fractions were combined,
dried with MgSO4, and evaporated to give compound 3 (3.082 g) as a colorless oil.

The organic fraction
obtained upon the addition of NaCl was evaporated, dissolved in a
mixture of PE and Et2O (1:1, 6 mL), and washed with brine
(6 × 30 mL) until compound 3 is removed from the
organic phase. The remaining organic phase was discarded. Then, the
aqueous fractions were combined and extracted again with EtOAc (4
× 20 mL). Ethyl acetate fractions were combined, dried with MgSO4 and evaporated to give an additional portion of compound 3 (400 mg) as colorless oil. Both fractions of compound 3 had the same appearance and purity by NMR and therefore
were combined resulting totally 3.482 g (51%) of the target compound.

Ethylcyclopentane (4)
Typical Procedure
A 5-ethyl-4-hydroxycyclopent-2-en-1-one
(3) (756 mg, 6 mmol) was dissolved in EtOAc (15 mL).
La(OTf)3 (510 mg, 15 mol %) was added, followed by 10 wt
% Pd/C (102 mg, 1.6 mol % Pd). The reaction vessel was equipped with
a magnetic stirrer and placed into the pressure reactor. The reactor
was washed three times with H2, then pressurized to 40
bar H2 (rt), and then heated to 200 °C for 24 h. After
this, the reactor was cooled down to rt and then a pressure was released.
Obtained liquid was filtered, washed with aqueous solution of NaCl
(sat., 10 mL) and dried with MgSO4. The obtained liquid
was analyzed by gas chromatography, which confirmed the formation
of ethylcyclopentane in 85% yield.

Solvent-Free Procedure
A flask was charged with 5-ethyl-4-hydroxycyclopent-2-en-1-one
(3) (2400 mg, 19 mmol), La(OTf)3 (567 mg,
5 mol %) and 10 wt % Pd/C (340 mg, 1.6 mol % Pd). The reaction vessel
was equipped with a magnetic stirrer and placed into the pressure
reactor. The reactor was washed three times with H2, then
pressurized to 40 bar H2 (rt), and then heated to 200 °C
for 24 h. After this, the reactor was cooled down to rt, and then,
a pressure was released. All nonvolatile components have remained
in the reaction flask, and the colorless liquid that has condensed
into the reactor was collected and dried with MgSO4 to
give pure ethylcyclopentane (897 mg) in a 48% yield. 1H
NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 1.63–1.78 (m, 3H),
1.53–1.61 (m, 2H), 1.46–1.52 (m, 2H), 1.31 (quin, J = 7.2 Hz, 2H), 1.03–1.11 (m, 2H), 0.89 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 3H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3): δ 42.2, 32.5, 29.1, 25.4, 13.3.
