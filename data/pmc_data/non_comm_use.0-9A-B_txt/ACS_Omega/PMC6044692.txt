For
the first time, rupture event scanning (REVS) procedure based
on quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and involving only mechanical
action was used to determine the height of the energy barrier for
dsDNA unwinding. Melting point was determined with the help of this
procedure. To determine the thermodynamic parameters including enthalpy,
DNA denaturation was represented as a unimolecular process. This allowed
us to recover the energy profiles from the experimental data obtained
by force measurements at different scanning times (reaction times)
for different temperatures. The thus obtained results were compared
with the data obtained with the help of another mechanical method,
namely, atomic force microscopy. The mechanism of DNA unwinding in
QCM-based experiments through the unzipping mode, as proposed by us
in previous works, was confirmed. Thus, we demonstrated that REVS
procedure may be used to assess the thermodynamic parameters of dsDNA
unwinding.

Introduction
Intermolecular forces
holding the DNA helices are of key importance
for biological processes. For example, they provide the response of
signaling system or immune reaction. The bonds underlying these processes
not only play decisive part in binding but also form a stable natural
molecular structure. The intramolecular stability is a compulsory
condition for functioning, so there should be a substantial energy
barrier separating the natural and denaturated states. How high that
barrier should be? Only measurements can give an exact answer. To
carry out the measurements of this kind, one needs rather sensitive
method that would not introduce distortions. DNA denaturation through
helix unwinding (a transition from dsDNA to ssDNA) may be carried
out either by rising temperature or using mechanical methods (apart
from numerous chemical methods involving the addition of various reagents,
which we will not consider in the present work).

Mechanical
separation of DNA double helices allows obtaining the
information on how DNA replication in vivo takes place. DNA replication
in living organisms is a very complicated process that involves specialized
proteins. At present, several methods are mainly used for mechanical
unwinding; these methods allowing one to determine the forces of noncovalent
bonding are optical or magnetic tweezers or atomic force microscopy
(AFM).1−9 Biomembrane force probing is also used for this purpose.10

For instance, it was demonstrated with
the help of AFM that thermal
oscillations contribute to the separation process; the probability
for the system to stay in the bound state decreases with temperature
rise.11 Because of this, bond lifetime
depends on the temperature; under mechanical action (stretching),
the dependence on the time of force action is also observed. With
an increase in stretching rate, the contribution from thermal oscillations
decreases, and definite force values are to be obtained. Theoretical
works describing DNA unwinding under the action of a constant force
imply the occurrence of thermal equilibrium and predict helix unwinding
to be a phase transition of the first kind, for which a minimal external
force is necessary.12−16 This force decreases with an increase in temperature and is equal
to zero in the thermal point of denaturation.

In the present
work, we continue to develop the procedure proposed
by us previously.17−19 It was demonstrated that unwinding of the DNA double
helix may be carried out with the help of quartz crystal microbalance
(QCM). In particular, temperature dependence was studied previously.20 In the present work, we made an attempt to determine
the height of the energy barrier. To compare our data with the data
available from literature and to verify our approach, we carried out
parallel AFM-based measurements with our oligonucleotides. This comparison
confirmed once more that unwinding proceeds according to the mechanism
proposed by us in our previous work.19

The schemes of measurement for both AFM- and QCM-based procedures
are shown in Figure 1. One can see that the QCM-based procedure is much easier in arrangement;
in addition, it is not necessary to search for an object on the surface.
A more detailed description and comparison of the methods can be found
in the review.18

Figure 1 Schemes of measurements
by means of AFM (a) and QCM (b). The directions
of force application for the unzipping mode (c) and the shear mode
(d) are shown. Schematic of helix unwinding in the case of QCM is
shown (e).

It should be kept in mind that
AFM-based procedure allows measurements
in two modes (shear and unzipping), whereas the QCM-based one works
only in the unzipping mode.

In our work, to study the temperature
dependence of double helix
unwinding, we used both methods (AFM- and QCM-based), and compared
the data obtained. Unlike for AFM, the QCM-based procedure allows
one to obtain a result averaged over an ensemble of particles in a
single measurement, so it is not necessary to carry out several hundred
measurements. Another essential advantage is that in QCM-based procedure,
the degrees of freedom are not limited, unlike for the case of AFM
when a cantilever is fixed to a molecule.

In the present work,
we used QCM for the first time to determine
the height of the energy barrier for dsDNA unwinding. A comparison
with the AFM data shows that the QCM-based approach may be used to
assess the thermodynamic data.

Experimental Section
Model oligonucleotides
specially synthesized with the help of the
automatic solid-phase method from commercially available precursors
were used in the work. The formulas of the nucleotides are shown below.19

M2: 5′- NH2-(CH2)6-pGATCATAGCTTCGAAAGATC-3′

N2-1: 5′-GATCTTTCGAAGCTATGATC-3′

N2-3: 5′-GACCTTTCGAAGCTATGATC-3′

N2-4: 5′-GATCTTTCGAAGCTATGCTC-3′

M2 was fixed on the QCM surface,
N2-1 is fully complementary to
oligonucleotide M2, whereas N2-3 and N2-4 have mismatches (marked).
The concentration of oligonucleotides fixed on the surface (M2) was
chosen to eliminate the mutual effect of the oligonucleotides on each
other. Relying on the size of the molecules, we determined that the
proper concentration of M2 on the surface should not exceed 1%. Oligonucleotides
were deposited using the procedure described elsewhere.19

Measurements with the Help of QCM
The AT-cut quartz
plates with the resonance frequency of 14.3 MHz were used in the work.

The scheme of the setup is shown in Figure 1. Harmonic voltage U0 is smoothly increased from 0 to 7 V; the maximal voltage
(7 V) was chosen on the basis of the results of previous experiments.19 Only helix unwinding occurs within this voltage
range. The time of voltage scanning was varied from 1 to 300 s.

With an increase in voltage, the amplitude of shear oscillations
of the QCM surface increases, and unwinding of the double helix occurs.
At the moment of unwinding, a characteristic signal appears, which
is taken from the filer adjusted to the third harmonic within a narrow
band ±5 kHz. The signal is then passed through an additional
amplifier to the input of a device playing the role of spectrum analyzer,
connected to a PC through the USB port. The value of this signal gives
the information about the number of broken bonds, whereas the position
over the voltage gives the value of detachment force, or unwinding
force in the case under consideration (for more details, see the Supporting Information).

Measurements by Means of
Atomic Force Spectroscopy
The force curves were recorded
with the help of atomic force microscope
MultiMode 8 AFM (Bruker). All of the measurements were carried out
in the aqueous medium in the presence of phosphate-buffered saline
solution (10 mM, pH 7.4) as the buffer agent. Data were analyzed using
the Force Reader program.

The force of bond rupture was measured
with the help of AFM for two modes: shear and unzipping (see Figure 2). The force value
determined with the help of QCM corresponds to the unzipping mode,
which is in good agreement with the model proposed previously.19

Figure 2 Distribution of probabilities plotted on the basis of
informative
force curves selected from 1000 cycles of cantilever advance retract.
The data were approximated with Gaussian function. Curves for two
modes are shown: ○, shear mode; □, unzipping. Force
value obtained for unzipping corresponds to the value determined with
the help of QCM. Measurements were carried out in a buffer solution
at T = 30 °C. Loading rate: 500 nm s–1.

Results and Discussion
In our experiments, temperature was varied from 15 to 50 °C.
Temperature was not risen above this value because it was impossible
to determine the moment of rupture at a higher temperature. The dependencies
of rupture forces on temperature for two methods, AFM and QCM based,
are shown in Figure 3. Melting temperature was determined by extrapolation to the point
where the rupture force is equal to zero. Thus, the obtained value
for a completely complementary pair of oligonucleotides is 57 °C.
The melting temperature (Tm) determined
with the help of UV melting was 58.4 ± 0.1 °C.20 In the case when mismatches were present (M2/N2-3,
M2/N2-4), the melting temperature was 53 and 51 °C, respectively,
whereas the values determined with the help of UV melting were 53.8
± 0.1 and 52.8 ± 0.1 °C, respectively.

Figure 3 Dependence of rupture
force on temperature: (a) measured with the
help of AFM for M2/N2-1, (b) measured with the help of QCM: (1) M2/N2-1;
(2) M2/N2-3; and (3) M2/N2-4.

The rupture force depends on the scanning rate. The reciprocal
value to scanning rate in the QCM-based procedure is an equivalent
of the loading rate in the AFM-based procedure. In our case, scanning
time is the time interval within which the amplitude of voltage supplied
to the QCM increases from 0 to 7 V. For long time intervals, saturation
occurs, and the probability of rupture tends to a definite value depending
on temperature, that is, rupture occurs practically at the same voltage.
So, we see two regions: for short scanning time, the contribution
from unwinding due to thermal oscillations decreases, and unwinding
occurs at a larger amplitude of surface oscillations. With an increase
in temperature, the role of thermal oscillations increases. The dependence
of the rupture force on the loading rate and scanning rate is shown
in Figure 4. The load
value for the fixed rate may be obtained as a product of the rate
and the cantilever stiffness coefficient. The range of loading rates
in which force measurements are usually carried out is 1–100
nN/s. For QCM-based studies, we proposed to use the scanning rate
(the rate of an increase in the amplitude of alternating voltage supplied
to the QCM during measurement). It was demonstrated experimentally
that the rupture force depends on scanning time. Scanning time is
the time interval during which the amplitude of voltage supplied to
the QCM changes from 0 to the maximal value.  For scanning time
shorter than 15 s, we observe a decrease in rupture force with an
increase in scanning time. The rupture force becomes constant for
scanning time longer than 15 s. The linear fitting for the curves
shown in Figure 4a
is presented in the Supporting Information as Figure S1. All of the data obtained with the help of QCM were
processed using MatLab software. The data presented in Figure 4b relating to two temperature
points are shown as an example explaining how calculations were carried
out. Actually, six temperature points were involved, each point included
7–10 measurements.

Figure 4 Dependence of rupture force on the scanning
rate in the QCM-based
procedure (reciprocal scanning time) as an analogue of loading rate
in AFM: (a) AFM for two modes (○, shear; □, unzipping),
measurements were carried out at 25 °C, (b) QCM for two temperature
points.

Below we will consider the denaturation
process, or unwinding of
the DNA double helix, as a unimolecular reaction (see Figure 5):

Figure 5 Scheme
of the energy profile of DNA denaturation under the action
of an external force decreasing the height of the barrier.

The reaction proceeds in the presence of an external
force. In
the general case, reaction rate is equal to  where ko is the
pre-exponential factor, ΔE is the activation
energy (depending on the applied force as shown below), kB is Boltzmann constant, and T is the
temperature.

So, if we know the geometry of the molecule and
the rupture force
at a given temperature, it is possible to determine the dissociation
energy ΔE0.

Considering this
unimolecular reaction, we will adhere to the idea
developed for AFM.21 Bell was the first
to postulate a linear decrease in dissociation energy ΔE0 under the action of the exerted force F(22) 1  where x is displacement.
A linear increase in the force of bond rupture depending on the logarithm
of loading rate was reported.23 A similar
behavior was demonstrated for protein unwinding. This is a direct
consequence of the exponential decrease in the lifetime of a bond
to which the force is applied.10,24

Bond lifetime
is 2  where τo is the frequency
pre-exponential factor and kBT is the thermal energy.

Bond length x depicts
the reaction coordinate.
This value is interpreted as a distance between the ground state and
the energy barrier along the reaction route. The reaction will follow
the route corresponding to the lowest energy barrier. The rate constant
for the thermal contribution into dissociation Koff(F) for the bond to which the external
force is applied may be easily estimated from eqs 1 and 2  Bond lifetime is an essential
parameter to
describe the kinetics of bond rupture. The value directly measured
in the experiment, both with AFM and with QCM, is the rupture force.
Because rupture is a random process, we cannot expect to measure only
one specific rupture force. We observe a value averaged over many
bonds. As shown in Figure 4, bond rupture depends on the scanning time. Lifetime (t) for a given temperature (T) can be determined
by scaling at the zero rupture force from the dependence of rupture
force on the reciprocal scanning time (see Figure 4b), from which we obtain the dependence ln t on 1/T.

The enthalpy of activation
for dissociation can be determined from
the slope of ln tversus  1/T, which gives 90 ± 15 kcal/mol. Although
only an estimated value, it is in good agreement with the data obtained
by other authors using AFM- and NMR-based procedures.25−27

Conclusions
Temperature stability and determination of thermodynamic
characteristics
of oligonucleotides were assessed through the direct measurement of
the force of unwinding of a complementary pair of oligonucleotides.
For the direct measurement of rupture force, AFM and QCM in the active
mode were used. Smoothly increasing the alternating voltage at the
QCM, we thus increase the amplitude of its surface oscillations and
detect the amplitude at which the rupture occurs. The sensitivity
of these procedures allows their reliable application to study DNA
stability.

The QCM-based procedure has several advantages over
the AFM-based
procedure, which is widely used for these measurements. First, a QCM
measurement is carried out not over a single object but over many
objects at once, and we obtain an averaged result in one measurement.
Second, sample preparation is much simpler for QCM than for AFM because
immobilization is to be carried out only at the substrate in the QCM-based
procedure, whereas for AFM, it is necessary to carry out immobilization
on the cantilever and search for a complementary oligonucleotide on
the substrate.

Within the QCM-based procedure, the melting point
of oligonucleotides
is determined from the temperature dependence; this value is in good
agreement with the data obtained by means of UV melting.

The
enthalpy of activation is determined from the dependence of
the force on scanning time and is in good agreement with the values
obtained using other methods.

The presence of mismatches causes
destabilization of the complex,
and unwinding force decreases. The most substantial decrease in the
force is observed when mismatches are present at the outer end of
oligonucleotide, which serves as a good confirmation of the fact that
unwinding starts from the outer end (unzipping). The numerical value
of unwinding force determined with the help of QCM-based procedure
is 30–40 pN, which is in agreement with the data obtained by
means of AFM for unzipping mode.
