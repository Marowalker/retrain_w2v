An
efficient Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction of phenylboronic
acids and benzyl carbonates was developed, producing diarylmethanes.
Benzyl acetates could also be used as coupling partners instead of
benzyl carbonates, affording diarylmethanes in comparable yields.
This reaction can be conducted under air atmosphere without any care
for moisture and oxygen. The ester function showed an intermediate
reactivity between chloro and bromo groups. This property facilitated
the selective synthesis of diverse (benzyl)biphenyls by successive
Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reactions using bromo- and chloro-substituted
benzyl esters with two types of boronic acids.

Introduction
The diphenylmethane
framework is often found in polymers,1 dyes,2 and bioactive
compounds.3 Although simple diphenylmethane
derivatives are easily prepared by acid-catalyzed benzylation,4 this protocol cannot afford substituted diphenylmethanes
because of several limitations of Friedel–Crafts alkylation.
This problem is easily solved by using the Suzuki–Miyaura coupling
reaction, facilitating the synthesis of substituted unsymmetrical
diphenylmethanes. In such cases, benzyl halides are widely used as
a coupling partner of an organic boron compound; however, it is necessary
to convert the precursor benzyl alcohol to the corresponding benzyl
halide beforehand.5 During the recent developments
of synthetic methods for diphenylmethanes, much attention has been
paid to other coupling partners: benzyl ethers6 and benzyl esters such as acetates,7 pivalates,8 carbamates,9 carbonates,10 sulfonates,11,12 sulfones,13 and phosphates.14 However, these methods require special catalysts and inert gas atmosphere,
preventing the practical synthesis of diphenylmethanes. Therefore,
we aimed to develop a more convenient approach to diphenylmethane
derivatives from easily available boronic acid derivatives and benzyl
acetates (or carbonates) under air atmosphere12,15 using a simple catalyst prepared from a commercially available Pd
source and phosphine ligand. Furthermore, the selective synthesis
of (benzyl)biphenyls was achieved via the successive Suzuki–Miyaura
coupling reactions using bromo- and chloro-substituted benzyl esters
with two types of boronic acids.

Results and Discussion
The cross-coupling reaction of benzyl methyl carbonate (1a) with phenylboronic acid (2a) to form diphenylmethane
(3a) under air atmosphere was selected as the model reaction
to optimize the reaction conditions, and phosphine ligands, Pd sources,
bases, and solvents were screened (Table 1). Among the Pd sources, PdCl2 showed a higher reactivity than Pd(OAc)2 and [Pd(η3-C3H5)Cl]2 (entries 1–3);
thus, PdCl2 was used for subsequent optimization because
of its low-cost and easy-to-use property. A phosphine ligand was crucial
for the success of this reaction (entries 3–8). Although the
monophosphine coordination Pd complex did not work, the bidentate
phosphine ligands exhibited a high catalytic activity and bis[2-(diphenylphosphino)phenyl]
ether (DPEPhos) afforded 3a in the highest yield. NaHCO3 was found to be a more effective base than K2CO3 and Na2CO3 (entries 8–10). This
reaction was also influenced by the solvent (entries 10–14).
Polar protic solvents such as t-BuOH and EtOH were
suitable solvents to increase the yield of 3a up to 79%
(entry 14).

With optimized conditions in hand,
coupling reactions of other
benzyl carbonates 1b–f and phenylboronic acids 2a–d were performed to obtain unsymmetrical diphenylmethanes
(Table 2). This reaction
was influenced by the electronic nature of the substituent on benzyl
carbonate 1 (entries 1–5). When electron-rich
benzyl ester 1b was used, the reaction efficiently afforded
diphenylmethane 3b in an excellent yield (entry 1). Benzyl
esters 1c and 1d showed a reactivity similar
to that of 1a (entries 2 and 3). Notably, chloro-substituted
benzyl carbonate 1d also afforded diarylmethane 3d in 68% yield without any detectable byproduct caused by
an oxidative addition of Pd(0) to the C–Cl bond
(entry 3). In the cases of 1e and 1f bearing
an electron-withdrawing trifluoromethyl group, the yields of 3e and 3f decreased (entries 4 and 5). By contrast,
the electronic nature of boronic acids did not affect this reaction;
both the electron-rich and electron-poor boronic acids 2b and 2c exhibited almost the same reactivity, affording
the corresponding products 3g and 3h in
high yields (entries 6 and 7). Next, the steric effect of the ortho-substituent
was investigated (entries 8–10). Although sterically hindered
carbonate 1f decreased the reaction efficiency, boronic
acid 2d afforded diphenylmethane 3i without
any influence of the ortho-substituent.

The tolerance
of a chloro group of 1d under the coupling
conditions prompted us to study the selective synthesis of (benzyl)biphenyls 4 (Scheme 1). Diphenylmethane 3d obtained from chlorobenzyl carbonate 1d and 2a underwent the coupling reaction with
4-methoxyphenylboronic acid (2b), affording (4-benzyl)biphenyl 4a in a moderate yield. On the other hand, when bromobenzyl
carbonate 1h was reacted with 2a under the
same conditions, the coupling reaction occurred on the benzene ring,
affording biphenyl 5.16 Different
types of (benzyl)biphenyl 4b were prepared by subsequent
coupling reactions with 2b. Thus, the order of reactivity
for the coupling reaction is C–Br > C–O > C–Cl,
facilitating the selective C–C bond formation at the desired
position.17 Different reactivities of the
C–Br and C–O bonds of 3h facilitate the
one-pot synthesis of several types of (benzyl)biphenyls 4c–g in moderate to high yields by two sequential coupling reactions
by changing the reaction order with boronic acids 2 (Table 3), that is, the first
coupling reaction mainly occurs at the C–Br bond, and the second
reaction occurs at the C–O bond. These results provide important
insights into the molecular design and elaborate synthesis of (benzyl)biphenyls
and their analogues.

boronic acid 2 (1.5 equiv), PdCl2 (5 mol %),

A plausible reaction mechanism
is shown in Scheme 2. The reaction is initiated by the oxidative
addition of the Pd species to the C–O bond, accompanied by
the elimination of CO2, affording cationic (η3-benzyl)Pd(II) 6.10 After σ-complex 7 is formed under equilibrium
with 6, intermediate 8 is formed by the
transmetalation with arylboronic acid. The subsequent reductive elimination
furnishes the cross-coupling product 3 and regenerates
the Pd(0) species. When an electron-withdrawing group was introduced
on the benzyl group of 1, the reaction did not proceed
efficiently because cationic intermediate 6 is destabilized.

Scheme 2 Plausible Mechanism for the Coupling Reaction Using Benzyl Carbonate 1
Considering the above
results, the Suzuki–Miyaura coupling
reaction was studied using more easily available benzyl acetates 9 instead of carbonates 1. When acetate 9a was subjected to the reaction with phenylboronic acid (2a) under the optimized conditions determined for carbonate 1a, the reaction proceeded similarly, affording diphenylmethane
(3a) in a considerably low yield (Table 4, entry 1). This result indicates that the
reactivity of 9a is lower than that of 1a. Indeed, the yield increased to 72% by prolonging the reaction time
to 24 h. In this reaction, bidentate phosphine ligands were also effective;
DPPPent showed the best performance (entries 1–5).

The reaction
rate was significantly influenced by the type of solvent
(Table 5). Polar protic
solvents such as EtOH and MeOH were effective to complete the reaction
within 1 day (entries 1, 7, and 8). Indeed, while the reaction did
not proceed in toluene, adding a small amount of EtOH accelerated
the reaction (entries 5 and 6). The reaction proceeded in alcoholic
media even at 60 °C, even though a longer reaction time was necessary
(entries 7 and 8).

The coupling
reaction of benzyl acetate 9 proceeds
in a manner similar to that of benzyl carbonate 1, as
shown in Scheme 2.
In this mechanism, the formation of intermediate complexes 6 and 7 seems to be crucial. In the case of carbonate 1, the formation of 6 accompanied by decarboxylation
is an irreversible process, facilitating the subsequent coupling reaction.
Conversely, acetate 9 is regenerated under equilibrium
even though cationic (η3-benzyl)Pd(II) 10 is formed; this is a probable reason for the less reactivity of
acetate 9 than that of carbonate 1. When
EtOH was used as a solvent, intermediates 6′ and 7′ were efficiently formed under the biased equilibrium,
accelerating the reaction (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Plausible Mechanism for Forming Intermediate 7′ from Benzyl Acetate 9
Other benzyl acetates 9b–e were subjected to
the coupling reaction with arylboronic acids 2a–d under the optimized conditions (Table 6). The reactions showed substituent effect
similar to that observed in the reactions of benzyl carbonates 1 shown in Table 2, that is, although the electron-rich acetates efficiently
underwent the coupling reaction, the yield of 3 decreased
in the case of electron-poor acetates (entries 1–3). Furthermore,
the use of an ortho-substituent decreased the yield of the reaction
(entry 4). On the other hand, this reaction was not influenced by
the electronic nature of boronic acid 2 (entries 5–7).

Easy access to benzyl acetates enabled the direct
transformation
of benzyl alcohols 11 to diphenylmethanes 3 in one pot (Scheme 4). Benzyl alcohol 11a afforded 3a in a
comparable yield upon the sequential treatment with acetic anhydride
in the presence of triethylamine followed by the Pd-catalyzed coupling
reaction with boronic acid 2a; the precursor benzyl acetate 9a was not isolated. This protocol was applicable to both
electron-rich and electron-poor benzyl alcohols 11b and 11c, furnishing the corresponding diphenylmethanes 3b and 3e, respectively, without a significant decrease
in the yields.

Scheme 4 Direct One-Pot Conversion from Benzyl Alcohols 11 to
Diarylmethanes 3
4-Bromobenzyl acetate 9f also served as the
precursor
of (benzyl)biphenyls 4e and 4f (Scheme 5). The less reactivity
of 9f than 1h facilitated a more selective
coupling reaction at the C–Br bond than that at the C–O
bond, thus affording 4e and 4f in higher
yields, respectively. Because (benzyl)biphenyls bearing both electron-donating
and electron-withdrawing groups have not been synthesized except for
several examples,18 this protocol is a
new synthetic tool for such compounds.

Scheme 5 One-Pot Synthesis
of Two Kinds of (Benzyl)biphenyls 4e and 4f by Changing the Order of Reaction with Boronic
Acids 2b and 2c
Each
reaction was conducted using
boronic acid 2 (1.5 equiv), PdCl2 (5 mol %),
DPPPent (5.5 mol %), and NaHCO3 (3 equiv) with heating
at 80 °C in ethanol. Condition iii: for 3 h. Condition iv: for 1 d.

Conclusions
Two synthetic methods were developed for diphenylmethanes 3 by Suzuki–Miyaura coupling using benzyl esters such
as benzyl carbonates 1 and benzyl acetates 9. In both the cases, the Pd catalyst was generated from commercially
available PdCl2 and bidentate bis(phosphine)s, and the
reaction was conducted in air atmosphere. This is advantageous from
practical viewpoints compared to the conventional methods. It is also
possible to synthesize diphenylmethanes 3 in one pot
from benzyl alcohols 11 by sequential acetylation and
coupling reactions. Furthermore, diverse (benzyl)biphenyls 4 were successfully synthesized by utilizing different reactivities
of the C–Br and C–O bonds.

Experimental Section
General
Procedure of the Suzuki–Miyaura Coupling Reaction
To a solution of PdCl2 (1.8 mg, 10 μmol), DPEPhos
(5.9 mg, 11 μmol), NaHCO3 (50.2 mg, 0.6 mmol), and
phenylboronic acid 2a (36.6 mg, 0.3 mmol) in ethanol
(1.0 mL), benzyl carbonate 1a (33.2 mg, 0.2 mmol) was
added, and the resultant mixture was heated in a screw-capped sealed
tube at 80 °C for 3 h. After filtration using a Celite pad, the
filtrate was extracted with hexane (10 mL × 3). The combined
organic layer was washed with brine (10 mL × 1), dried over MgSO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was
treated with flash column chromatography (EtOAc/hexane = 90/10) to
afford the coupling product 3a (26.5 mg, 0.158 mmol,
79%).

When other conditions and substrates were employed, the
experiments were conducted in a similar way.
