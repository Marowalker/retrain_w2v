The
potential application of a carbon nanocomposite from battery
anode materials modified with magnesium (Mg) was explored to remove
phosphate from aqueous solutions. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
shows that the Mg content of the prepared Mg/C composite is around
23.5%. Laboratory batch adsorption kinetics and equilibrium isotherm
experiments demonstrate that the composite has an extremely high phosphate
adsorption capacity of 406.3 mg PO4/g, which is among the
highest phosphate removal abilities reported so far. Results from
XRD, SEM-EDX, and XPS analyses of the postsorption Mg/C composite
indicate that phosphate adsorption is mainly controlled by the precipitation
of P to form Mg3(PO4)2·8H2O and MgHPO4·1.2H2O nanocrystals
on the surface of the adsorbent. The approach of synthesizing Mg-enriched
carbon-based adsorbent described in this work provides new opportunities
for disposing spent batteries and developing a low-cost and high-efficiency
adsorbent to mitigate eutrophication.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Phosphorus, as a limiting
nutrient and an essential element for
the growth of organisms and plants, is an indicator of surface water
quality. However, excessive point and/or nonpoint discharges of phosphate
into water bodies such as lakes, rivers, and seas lead to the eutrophication
of freshwater and deteriorate aquatic ecosystems subsequently, which
has been occurring throughout the world.1,2 To address
the eutrophication issue, it is necessary to remove phosphate from
aqueous solutions before their discharge into surface runoff and natural
water bodies.3,4 However, phosphate removal has
long been facing technical difficulties in wastewater treatment systems
because of the lack of efficient and convenient approaches.

Current phosphate removal technologies for municipal sewage and
industrial effluents mainly include biological, chemical, and physical
treatment methods.5 Recently, simple physical
adsorption has attracted considerable attention because it is comparatively
more efficient and cost-effective.6,7 However, the
most common adsorbents such as activated carbon, fly ash, slay, and
oxide tailings exhibit relatively low phosphate adsorption capacity,
which is lower than 20.0 mg/g.8−11 Pioneering work by Yao et al. on engineered carbon
decorated with MgO nanoparticles demonstrated significantly improved
phosphate removal capacity. These engineered
carbon materials were obtained through the pyrolysis of anaerobically
digested sugar beet tailings or Mg-enriched tomato leaves. The superior
phosphate sorption ability is attributed to the presence of the nanosized
MgO particles on the biochar surfaces, which can facilitate the precipitation
of phosphate on carbon surfaces.12,13 In other words,
the concentration of Mg in the engineered biochar controls its phosphate
removal ability. However,
the inherent nature of low Mg contents (<1%) in regular feedstock
for carbon production, such as agricultural residues, seriously affects
the phosphate removal capability of magnesium and thus limits its
practical application. Therefore, it is very important to develop
new approaches for the fabrication of Mg-enriched engineered carbon
to improve the rate of phosphate removal.

From the environmental
perspective, producing nanosized magnesium
(Mg) compounds on the surface of carbon recovered from waste materials
is considered as a more eco-friendly approach with additional benefits
to the economy.14−16 In our previous study, we preliminarily investigated
the phosphate removal capacity of Mg-enriched engineered carbons (MesoCarbon
MicroBeads, MCMB) from the anode materials of lithium-ion batteries
(LIBs), which demonstrated that the Mg modification dramatically promotes
the phosphate removal ability of MCMB and that the phosphate removal
rate reaches as high as 95%.17 In this
study, we conduct a series of experiments to determine phosphate sorption
kinetics, mechanisms, and characteristics of Mg-enriched engineered
carbons (MCMB) from LIBs. The specific objective of this study is
to investigate the physicochemical properties of the original and
postsorption Mg/C nanocomposites and the mechanisms governing the
adsorption of phosphate onto the Mg/C nanocomposite in detail. This
study provides clear evidence that building nanosized magnesium (Mg)
compounds on the surface of carbon materials from the anode materials
of LIBs has great potential to effectively remove phosphate from wastewater.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Preparation of Mg/C Nanocomposites
MCMB graphite powder (Kejing Company, China) was used to synthesize
nanostructured Mg/C composites in this study. MCMB was immersed in
concentrated nitric acid and stirred at room temperature overnight.
After being washed with deionized (DI) water and dried in an oven
at 80 °C, 5 g of oxidized MCMB was added to 30 mL of 2.07 mol/L
magnesium nitrate (Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, Beijing Chemical Works) solution. The mixture was stirred and
then oven-dried to remove water and was heated at 10 °C/min up
to 600 °C for 1 h under a N2 flow. The Mg/C composite
produced from pyrolysis was washed several times with DI water and
then oven-dried at 80 °C followed by grinding it into fine powder
for the subsequent experiments.

2.2 Phosphate
Adsorption
Phosphate solutions
were prepared by dissolving potassium phosphate dibasic anhydrous
(K2HPO4, Beijing Chemical Works) in DI water.
The adsorption kinetics experiment was carried out by mixing 0.05
g of the Mg/C composite to 25 mL of phosphate solutions with an initial
phosphate concentration of 153.2 mg/L (50 mg P/L) in 50 mL plastic
centrifuge tubes. The tubes were then shaken at 200 rpm in a mechanical
shaker at room temperature (22 ± 0.5 °C). At appropriate
time intervals,
the tubes were withdrawn and the mixtures were immediately filtered
through mixed cellulose ester (MCE) membrane filters of pore size
0.22 μm.

The adsorption isotherm experiment was carried
out similarly by mixing 0.1 g of Mg/C to 50 mL of phosphate solutions
of different concentrations ranging from 30.6 to 1532.3 mg/L (10–500
mg P/L) in centrifuge tubes. The tubes were then shaken in a mechanical
shaker for 24 h at room temperature (which is sufficient to reach
adsorption equilibrium). The supernatant solution was separated from
the adsorbent to determine the adsorbed phosphate concentrations.
The phosphate concentrations in the liquid-phase samples were determined
using the ascorbic acid method (ESS Method 310.118) and a spectrophotometer (UB 2800, Hitachi, Japan). It
should be noted that the concentration of Mg(OH)2/MgO in
the solution is negligible (∼100 ppm). The phosphate concentrations
in the solid phase were calculated based on the initial and final
aqueous concentrations. All experimental treatments were performed
in duplicate, and the average values are reported. The postadsorption
Mg/C samples were collected, rinsed with deionized water, and dried
at 80 °C for further characterizations.

The effects of
pH on phosphate adsorption by Mg/C were investigated
by mixing 0.05 g of Mg/C to 25 mL of 153.2 mg/L phosphate solutions,
with an initial solution pH ranging from 1 to 11 (i.e., 1.6, 3.1,
4.1, 5.4, 7.3, 8.6, and 10.4). The mixtures were shaken for 24 h and
filtered to analyze aqueous and adsorbed phosphate concentrations
using the same procedure. It should be pointed out that the final
pH after adsorption is around 10 for all samples.

2.3 Characterizations
Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) of carbon before and after Mg modification was carried
out under a stream of air at a heating rate of 10 °C/min using
a thermogravimetric analyzer (TG/DTA 6200 LAB SYS). The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) analysis was carried out using a computer-controlled X-ray diffractometer
(Rigaku Ultima IV, Rigaku, Japan), and data were collected in the
2θ range of 10°–90° at a scan rate of 8°
per minute to investigate the crystallographic structures and the
crystallite size on the postadsorption Mg/C composite. A scanning
electron microscope coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(SEM-EDX, Quanta FEG 250, FEI, USA) was used to analyze the surface
morphology of the postadsorption Mg/C composite and to determine their
surface elemental composition at the same spot that was used for SEM.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out
using a PHI Quantera-II spectrometer (Ulvac-PHI, INC, Japan) to further
analyze the elemental composition on the postadsorption Mg/C sample.

3 Results and Discussion
The thermal stability
of the Mg/C composite prepared is estimated
using thermogravimetric analysis in a temperature range of 40–850
°C in an air atmosphere, with a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
The TGA results show that the Mg/C composites have similar and comparable
thermal stability to the unmodified samples, indicating that the thermal
stability of the carbon sample was not affected by the Mg-modification
process (Figure 1).
The negligible weight loss from room temperature to about 200 °C
is likely due to the dehydration of the samples. A marked weight loss
of about 6.5% is observed for the Mg/C composite in the temperature
range of 332–380 °C. According to the previous studies,
Mg usually exists as Mg(OH)2 and MgO on the surface of
the carbon matrix in the Mg/C composite. Such weight loss could be
attributed to the decomposition and transformation of Mg(OH)2 to MgO.19,20 Decomposition of the main carbon chain starts
at about 690 °C and continues up to 850 °C with the evolution
of carbon dioxide.21 Almost all of the
weight was removed as gaseous products for the unmodified C sample,
whereas the residue of Mg/C composite is approximately 38.9% corresponding
to the MgO content. The Mg concentration of the Mg/C composite is
calculated to be 23.5% by weight ratio (38.9% × M(Mg)/M(MgO)
= 38.9% × 24.3/40.3) based on the MgO content in the sample.

of unmodified carbon (C) and the Mg/C composite.

Adsorption kinetics is one of the most pivotal factors in
predicting
the rate of adsorption reactions and provides valuable information
to understand the mechanism of the sorption.22 The phosphate adsorption capacity on the Mg/C sorbent as a function
of contact time is provided in Figure 2A. The results suggest that the adsorption process
is clearly time-dependent. As the reaction time increases, the amount
of phosphate adsorbed increases until reaching its equilibrium. Specifically,
the adsorption rate was quite high during the first hour, followed
by a much slower sorption in the next few hours, and eventually reached
its equilibrium at about 4 h (Figure 2A). This type of adsorption process is due to the significant
differences in the phosphate concentration (i.e., concentration gradient).
The concentration differences between the solution and the sorbent
were gradually removed, and the active sites on the sorbent were used
up during the first 4 h.4 The time taken
to reach equilibrium in this study is much faster than that of other
types of biochars (∼24 h),6,23 suggesting
that the Mg nanocomposites on the carbon surface are active in efficiently
accelerating the reaction rate with phosphate and thus favoring the
adsorption.

on the Mg/C composite. Symbols represent experimental data, and lines
represent model results.

To further clarify the characteristics of the phosphate adsorption
process onto Mg/C, mathematical models were applied to simulate the
data of sorption kinetics, including the pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order,
Ritchie Nth-order, and Elovich models, as shown below24 1.1   1.2   1.3   1.4  where qt (mg/g) and qe (mg/g) represent
the amount of phosphate adsorbed at time t and at
equilibrium, respectively; k1 with unit
h–1, k2 with unit g/(mg h), and kn with unit gn–1/(mgn–1 h) are adsorption rate
constants for the four kinetic models, respectively. In the Elovich
model, α (mg/(g h)) represents the initial adsorption rate and
β (g/mg) is the desorption constant. The first-, second-, and
the Nth-order models describe the kinetics of the
solid–solution system based on mononuclear, binuclear, and N-nuclear adsorption, respectively, in terms of the sorbent
capacity. The pseudo-second-order kinetics model is based on the assumption
that the rate-limiting step is determined by the chemical sorption,
or chemisorption, process involving valence forces through sharing
or exchanging of electrons between the adsorbent and the adsorbate,25 whereas the Elovich model is an empirical equation
considering the contribution of desorption.6 Except for the Elovich model, all of the other three tested models
fit the kinetics data quite well, with R2 exceeding 0.95 (Figure 2A). Both the kinetics parameters and the correlation coefficients
from the four adsorption models are listed in Table 1. The correlation coefficients R2 vary in the order of Nth order >
first
order > second order > Elovich. The result reveals that the Nth-order model is the most suitable one to describe the
adsorption kinetics of phosphate on Mg/C, that is, the phosphate sorption
on the Mg/C composite is likely controlled by multiple mechanisms.
Additionally, it indicates that the chemical bonding between adsorbent
active sites and phosphate might dominate the adsorption process.25

Adsorption
equilibrium isotherm is the key for describing how adsorbates
interact with adsorbents and providing information on the capacity
of adsorbents removing pollutants under certain conditions.26,27 Five well-known models were employed to analyze the experimental
data and describe the equilibrium of phosphate adsorption onto Mg/C,
and the governing equations are listed below6 2.1   2.2   2.3   2.4   2.5  where Ce (mg/L)
represents the sorbate concentration at equilibrium and Q (mg/g) is the maximum capacity for different models; K (L/mg), Kf
(mg1–n Ln/g), Klf (Ln/mgn), and Kr (L/g) are the coefficients for the first four models, respectively; n (dimensionless), a (Ln/mgn), and b (J·g/mg)
and A (L/mg) are constants for the Freundlich, Redlich–Peterson,
and Temkin isotherm models, respectively.28 The Langmuir isotherm is applicable for the monolayer adsorption
of an adsorbate on a homogeneous surface of the adsorbent, which provides
information on uptake capabilities and also reflects the usual equilibrium
process behavior. Freundlich isotherm reveals information regarding
the heterogeneous adsorption and is not restricted to the formation
of a monolayer. The Langmuir–Freundlich isotherm model is a
combination of Langmuir and Freundlich models derived for predicting
the heterogeneous adsorption systems, whereas other models are empirical
equations, which are often used to describe chemisorptions onto the
surface of a heterogeneous site.6,29

All these models
exhibit results that agree well with the experimental
data (Figure 2B), and
all coefficients of determination (R2)
exceed 0.97. On the basis of the values of Q calculated
using the Langmuir equation, the maximum phosphate adsorption capacity
of Mg/C reaches up to 406.3 mg/g, which is much higher than those
of all other carbon-based adsorbents for phosphate removal from aqueous
solutions reported previously.6 This dramatically
improved performance is probably due to the pure and uniform carbon
(graphite) structure of Mg/C composite compared with that of conventional
amorphous biochar, which serves as an effective matrix for precipitating
phosphate from aqueous solutions by providing more active sites.30 In addition, the Langmuir–Freundlich
model with an R2 value of 0.991 and the
Redlich–Peterson model with an R2 value of 0.995 fit the data slightly better than the other three
models. Therefore, the adsorption of phosphate onto Mg/C could be
controlled by multiple processes onto the heterogeneous surface and
governed by multiple mechanisms, which is consistent with the findings
from previous kinetics studies.28

The pH value of the solution generally plays an important role
in the physicochemical reaction at the water–solid interface.
To investigate the effect of pH on the phosphate removal, the Mg/C
sample is examined by changing the initial pH of the solutions from
1.6 to 10.4. In general, pH does not show much impact on phosphate
removal ability of Mg/C nanocomposite, indicating that this carbon
material have strong affiliation to phosphate in aqueous solutions
in almost the entire pH range. The phosphate adsorption was the highest
when the pH is 5.4, suggesting the existence of an optimum pH for
the maximum phosphate adsorption, and it is in the typical pH range
of municipal and living effluents. Increasing the pH to 10.4 or decreasing
it to 1.6 slightly decreases the adsorption of phosphate (Figure 3). This result is
consistent with that of the previous studies: the optimum pH (although
it is not significant in this study) for phosphate removal by the
carbon nanocomposite surface should be around 5.2 theoretically, at
which pH almost all phosphate exists in the form of H2PO4– (i.e., mononuclear adsorption). If the
pH is higher or lower than the optimum value (i.e., 5.2), polynuclear
interactions may be triggered to consume more adsorption sites and
thus decrease phosphate adsorption. Hence,
the strong affiliation to phosphate and the broad pH suitability and
flexibility of Mg/C make it well suited for the practical application
in the wastewater treatment systems when compared with the traditional
chemical and biological technologies, most of which are very sensitive
to the operation conditions (mainly pH) and whose phosphate removal
efficiency may be much lower.31

Figure 3 Effect of the
solution pH on the amount of phosphate adsorption
onto Mg/C.

During the phosphate adsorption
process, Mg–P crystals gradually
formed on the surface of adsorbent matrix. The XRD spectrum of the
postsorption Mg/C sample shows strong signals of new Mg–P crystals
in the form mainly of Mg3(PO4)2·8H2O and a little of MgHPO4·1.2H2O
as well as of the preexisting Mg oxyhydroxides because Mg usually
exists as Mg(OH)2/MgO nanoparticles on the Mg/C surface
during sintering (Figure 4).20 The particle sizes estimated
using the Scherrer formula32,33 are calculated to be
29.5 ± 5.0 and 39.0 ± 7.6 nm for Mg3(PO4)2·8H2O and MgHPO4·1.2H2O, respectively. The XRD results suggest that the precipitation
of phosphate by Mg released from the nanocomposite could play an important
role in the phosphate removal from aqueous solutions. P anions play
an important role in facilitating the dissolution of Mg(OH)2 and MgO in the solution. Given the lower surface energy, the P salts
formed, Mg3(PO4)2·8H2O and MgHPO4·1.2H2O, prefer to nucleate
and further grow on the carbon surface.19 In addition, after adsorption, the final pH of the solutions increased
to around 10.9 from 5.2 and the phosphate could only exist as PO43– and HPO4–, which further explains the formation of Mg3(PO4)2·8H2O and MgHPO4·1.2H2O.

Figure 4 XRD spectrum of the postsorption Mg/C sample.

The morphology of the nanoscale Mg–P crystals formed
was
further examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the
composition was determined using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(the SEM–EDX analysis) (Figure 5A–C). As shown in the SEM image, the postsorption
Mg/C shows a large amount of Mg–P nanorods covering the entire
carbon surface with an average thickness of 54.6 nm (Figure 5B) compared with that before
the adsorption process showing a large amount of nanoplates.17 These nanocrystals were probably converted from
the nanoplatelet particles (i.e., Mg(OH)2 and MgO) on the
surface of the original Mg/C composite. The significant alteration
in the morphology of nanoparticles before and after P sorption suggests
that the precipitation could significantly impact the P removal by
the Mg/C nanocomposite. The EDX spectrum at the same spot as that
of SEM images further identifies these nanorods as Mg–P particles
because of the presence of high peaks of phosphorus, magnesium, and
oxygen besides carbon and these four elements are well-distributed
(Figures 5C and 6). EDX also indicates that the molar ratio between
P and Mg is 0.86. This number is between the P and Mg molar ratio
in Mg3(PO4)2·8H2O
(0.67) and that in MgHPO4·1.2H2O (1.00),
which further demonstrates that the newly formed precipitation on
Mg/C is mainly composed of both Mg3(PO4)2·8H2O and MgHPO4·1.2H2O. In addition, EDX results also give the molar ratio of P/O
as 0.10, which is smaller than that in Mg3(PO4)2·8H2O (0.13) and in MgHPO4·1.2H2O (0.19). The extra oxygen
content from the above calculation may be attributed to the functional
groups on the carbon surface, which further suggests that the functional
groups on the Mg/C composite did not interact with phosphate, and
therefore they do not contribute to the phosphate removal from aqueous
solutions.

Figure 5 SEM images (A,B) and corresponding EDX spectra (C) of the postsorption
Mg/C.

Figure 6 EDX mapping elements of carbon, oxygen, magnesium,
and phosphorus
of the postsorption Mg/C nanocomposite.

To further investigate the precipitation process, XPS was
performed
to analyze the P on the Mg/C composite. Figure 7 shows the XPS spectra of Mg 2p and P 2p
regions, which demonstrate the presence of two Mg–P compounds
on the postsorption carbon surface, that is, Mg3(PO4)2 and MgHPO4 (Figure 7B,C). The spectrum of P 2p shows that the
molar percentage of Mg3(PO4)2 and
MgHPO4 on the composite surface is around 27.8% and 72.2%,
respectively (Figure 7C). On the basis of these results, the molar ratio calculated between
P and Mg is 0.82, which is very close to that of the EDX analysis
(0.86). The Mg 2p spectrum shows a large quantity of Mg(OH)2 (65.3%) besides Mg–P compound (34.7%) on the postsorption
carbon surface, which reveals that the adsorbents are capable of adsorbing
more P anions from the aqueous solution until the depletion of Mg(OH)2. XRD, SEM, EDX, and XPS analyses of the postsorption Mg/C
composite collectively indicate that the precipitation of Mg–P
nanocrystals plays an important role in P removal from aqueous solutions
using the Mg/C composite prepared.

4 Conclusions
As an example of preparing adsorbents
for the wastewater treatment
from battery anode materials, the Mg-decorated graphite nanocomposite
shows an extremely high phosphate adsorption capacity of 406.3 mg/g,
which is among the highest phosphate removal abilities reported so
far. The sorption experiments and postsorption characterizations indicate
that phosphate adsorption is mainly controlled by the precipitation
of P to form Mg3(PO4)2·8H2O and MgHPO4·1.2H2O nanocrystals
on the surface of the adsorbent. The approach of synthesizing Mg-enriched
carbon-based adsorbent in this study provides new opportunities in
developing a low-cost and high-efficiency adsorbent to mitigate eutrophication
and introduces a novel direction for recycling spent batteries.
