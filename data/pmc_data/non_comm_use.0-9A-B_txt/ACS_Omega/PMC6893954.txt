We fabricated an
electrochemical immunosensor for the detection
of cardiac troponin I using β-cyclodextrin-functionalized helical
carbon nanotube and ionic liquid functionalized with ferrocene and
aldehyde groups. β-Cyclodextrin-functionalized helical carbon
nanotube was first modified on the electrode surface. Then, ferrocene-
and aldehyde-functionalized ionic liquid was modified on the surface
of the electrode through host–guest interaction, resulting
in an interface with aldehyde groups. The aldehyde groups attached
to the ionic liquid capture antibody directly, which simplifies the
fabrication of immunosensor. Because of the use of ionic liquid and
helical carbon nanotube, the conductivity of the sensing interface
was improved. Thus, the sensitivity of the fabricated immunosensor
was increased. The immunosensor for cardiac troponin I shows a linear
range from 0.05 to 20 ng mL–1 with a detection limit
of 0.04 ng mL–1 (S/N = 3).

Introduction
Acute myocardial infarction has seriously
threatened people’s
lives. An important standard in the evaluation of patients with acute
myocardial infarction has been accepted as cardiac troponin I (cTnI).1 Thus, rapid, sensitive, and accurate detection
for cTnI is of great significance for saving lives. In recent years,
a lot of methods for the quantitative detection of cTnI have been
developed.2−5 Although these methods possess high sensitivity, they need tedious
labeling process, highly skilled operators, and expensive equipment,
which hinder them to be widely applied in clinical detection. Recently,
electrochemical immunosensors have been attracting researchers’
attention because of its high specificity, easy miniaturization, handling,
and low cost.6,7 Material modified on the electrode
is a key factor affecting the working of sensors. Carbon nanomaterials
including graphene,8,9 carbon fibers,10 carbon dots,11 and linear carbon
nanotubes (LCNTs)12,13 were applied in the development
of electrochemical immunosensors. Compared with LCNT, helical carbon
nanotubes (HCNTs) have high area, excellent electrocatalytic activity,
and good electronic properties.14 However,
few papers about the fabrication of electrochemical immunosensors
using HCNTs were reported.15

β-Cyclodextrin
(CD) has a special structure with seven d-glucose units and
a toroidal shape. It is composed of a hydrophobic
inner cavity and a hydrophilic exterior, which result in high molecular
binding ability and supramolecular recognition ability.16 Thus, CD and some molecules are easy to form
stable host–guest complex. For example, Xie developed a biosensor
based on supramolecular recognition ability between CD and ferrocene.17 In addition, CD can improve the dispersity of
carbon nanomaterials.

Because ionic liquids (ILs) have some
good characteristics such
as high ionic conductivity, electrochemical stability, and biocompatibility,18−20 they are well used in the fabrication of electrochemical biosensors.
Unfortunately, the IL introduced on the electrode surface provided
a good microenvironment for antibody–antigen reaction. In addition,
they can improve the conductivity of sensing interface. They did not
carry any functional groups for antibody immobilization or other chemical
modification. In our previous work, aldehyde-functionalized IL was
prepared for the direct immobilization of antibody.21 Later, ferrocene- and aldehyde-functionalized IL was synthesized
for the fabrication of electrochemical immunosensor.22 In the above-mentioned immunosensors, IL functionalized
by aldehyde groups was introduced onto the electrode surface by incorporating
it into Nafion, where the combination of IL and Nafion depends on
the electrostatic action. To fix IL firmly on the electrode, functionalized
IL was modified onto the electrode surface by host–guest recognition
between CD and ferrocene.23 However, the
self-assembled monolayer made of the CD resulted in larger impedance,
which is bad for measuring the signal of differential pulse voltammetry
(DPV). To improve the conductivity of the electrode surface, we try
to use the nanocomposite of CD and HCNT to modify the electrode.

In this work, CD–HCNT was used as a substrate for capturing
ferrocene, which was attached to IL. Because of the host–guest
reaction between CD and ferrocene, functionalized IL containing ferrocene
and aldehyde groups was introduced to the electrode surface, where
the aldehyde groups can be used to directly immobilize antibody. On
the other hand, because of the use of the HCNT and IL, good conductivity
of the sensing interface was obtained, which avoided tedious labeling
process for signal amplification. Thus, the novel platform based on
HCNT–CD/Fc-IL-CHO was convenient and sensitive for the fabrication
of electrochemical immunosensors.

Results and Discussion
SEM Characterization
of HCNT–CD/Fc-IL-CHO
The
surface characteristics of the HCNT before (Figure 1A) and after being functionalized with CD/Fc-IL-CHO
(Figure 1B) were investigated
using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Figure 1A, HCNT looked similar to a
helical structure. Figure 1B showed that the HCNT–CD/Fc-IL-CHO was thicker than
HCNT because CD and Fc-IL-CHO cover the surface of HCNT. The results
are in good agreement with the reported literature.24

Cyclic Voltammetric Characterization of the
Electrode Modified
To study the electrochemical characteristics
of the electrode modified
step-by-step, cyclic voltammetric (CV) measurements were carried out
in 5 mM K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6]. The scan rate is 100 mV s–1, and the
range is from −0.2 to 0.6 V. As shown in Figure 2, the CV of the bare Au electrode is a well-defined
redox wave. When HCNT–CD/Fc-IL-CHO was introduced to bare Au
electrode, the peaks of CV increased again (Figure 2b). It should be attributed to the high conductivity
of HCNT and IL. After antibody (100 μg mL–1) was immobilized on the electrode surface (Figure 2c), the peak current decreased. Bovine serum
albumin (BSA) was modified on the electrode covered by antibodies
to eliminate nonspecific adsorption, and the corresponding peak current
of CV decreased (Figure 2d). After antibody captured antigen (5 ng mL–1),
the peak current of CV decreased again (Figure 2e). It was probably because the antibody–antigen
immunocomplex hindered the electron transfer.

(d), and cTnI/BSA/anti-cTnI/HCNT–CD/Fc-IL-CHO/Au (e) in 5 mM
Fe(CN)63–/Fe(CN)64–. Scan rate was 100 mV s–1.

Optimization of the Experimental Conditions
Some experimental
conditions including concentration of antibody, immobilization time
of antibody, concentration of BSA, and reaction time between antibody
and antigen need to be optimized. In these experiments, the concentration
of cTn I is 5 ng mL–1.

The influence of concentration
of anti-cTn I antibody on the peak current of DPV was investigated
from 20 to 120 μg mL–1. According to the results
shown in Figure 3A,
the anti-cTnI antibody concentration of 100 μg mL–1 was an optimal selection. The influence of antibody immobilization
time on the signals was studied in the range of 20–80 min.
When the time changed from 20 to 60 min, the peak current of DPV decreased
gradually. Then, when the time was longer than 60 min, the peak current
of DPV was stable (Figure 3B). Thus, we selected antibody immobilization time of 60 min
for this work. The concentrations of BSA were investigated from 1.0
to 4.0 wt %, the signals decreased with the increase in concentration
until 3.0 wt % (Figure 3C). Thus, we selected 3.0 wt % as the optimal concentration of BSA.

of the concentration of antibody on the peak current
of immunosensor. (B) Effect of immobilization time of antibody on
the peak current of immunosensor. (C) Effect of the concentration
of BSA on the peak current of immunosensor. The concentration of cTnI
is 5 ng mL–1.

Detection of cTnI
The formation of antibody–antigen
immunocomplex would hinder the electron transfer and therefore decrease
the peak current of DPV. Here, various concentrations of cTnI were
detected by the fabricated immunosensor. Figure 4 showed the DPV response to different cTnI
concentrations. As shown in Figure 4, the peak current decreased with the increasing concentration
of cTnI. The inset of Figure 4 indicated a good linear relationship between the cTnI concentrations,
and peak currents were obtained in the range of 0.05–20 ng
mL–1. The detection limit was 0.04 ng mL–1 (S/N = 3).

cTnI. Inset: Calibration curve of the immunosensor. Error bars represent
standard deviation, n = 3. The potential range was
from −0.4 to 0.6 V, pulse amplitude was 0.05 V, pulse width
was 0.05 s, and sample width was 0.02 s.

We compared the detection limit and linear range of the fabricated
immunosensor with that of other immunosensors for cTnI. These results
described in Table 1 showed that the fabricated immunosensor had an acceptable linear
range and detection limit.

Specificity,
Reproducibility, and Stability of the Immunosensor
To study
the specificity of the immunosensor, carcinoembryonic
antigen (CEA), BSA, and α-fetoprotein (AFP) were selected as
interfering species. The peak currents of DPV corresponding to CEA,
BSA, and AFP of 50 ng mL–1 and blank solution were
measured. The peak currents of DPV are close, demonstrating that the
specificity was satisfied.

The reproducibility of proposed immunosensor
was also studied. Inter- and intra-assay at 5 ng mL–1 cTnI were performed. The coefficients of variation was 5.5% for
interassay and 6.8% for intra-assay. These results indicated that
the fabricated immunosensor had a good reproducibility. After 10 days,
the current response of the immunosensor was retained at 89% of the
initial response, indicating that the stability of the immunosensor
was acceptable.

Analytical Application
To demonstrate
the feasibility
of the proposed immunosensor in real samples, recovery was investigated
using standard addition methods. We selected three spiked human serum
samples for experiments. The results are described in Table 2. The recoveries were from 97.5
to 109.1% and the relative standard deviation (RSD) were from 4.7
to 7.2%, indicating that the proposed immunosensor was reliable for
the detection of cTnI.

Conclusions
Here,
a label-free electrochemical immunosensor was developed using
CD-functionalized HCNT and IL-functionalized with ferrocene and aldehyde
groups as a substrate. The utilization of HCNT and IL improved the
conductivity of the sensing interface, resulting in a high sensitivity
of the immunosensor. In addition, aldehyde groups attached to IL can
be directly used to immobilize antibody, meaning the fabrication of
the immunosensor was easy and convenient.

Experimental Section
Reagents
and Apparatus
cTnI and anti-cTnI monoclonal
antibodies (anti-cTnI) were provided by Shanghai Linc-Bio Science
Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). We purchased BSA and human immunoglobulin
G from Beijing Dingguo Biotechnology Company (Beijing, China). Using
Na2HPO4 and KH2PO4, we
prepared 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0). HCNT was obtained
from Nanjing Xianfeng Nanomaterial Technology Ltd. (Nanjing, China).
Fc-IL-CHO was prepared by our group according to previous reports.21

Electrochemical measurements including
DPV and CV were carried out on an electrochemistry workstation (CHI
660E, Shanghai CH Instruments, China). All electrochemical measurements
were performed in a conventional three-electrode cell made of a saturated
calomel electrode as the reference electrode, a Pt electrode as the
counter electrode, and a gold electrode (Au) as the working electrode
(Au).The morphology of the HCNT before and after functionalization
with CD/Fc-IL-CHO was investigated with a TESCAN MIRA3 (LMU) microscope.

Preparation of HCNT–CD/Fc-IL-CHO
The composite
of HCNT–CD was prepared according to the reported method with
minor modification.16 HCNT (25 mg) and
CD (200 mg) were added to 50 mL of ultrapure water and stirred for
12 h. Then, the mixture was washed three times by centrifugation.
Fc-IL-CHO (20 mg) and CD–MWCNT (10 mg) were added to 10 mL
of dichloromethane solution and stirred for 6 h. HCNT–CD/Fc-IL-CHO
was obtained by centrifugation. The preparation of HCNT–CD/Fc-IL-CHO
is shown in Figure 5A.

Fabrication of the Immunosensor
Before the preparation
of the immunosensor, the gold electrode with 3 mm diameter (Au) was
polished carefully using 0.3 and 0.05 μm alumina slurries, followed
by sonication in doubly distilled water. Subsequently, a 10 μL
homogeneous suspension of HCNT–CD/Fc-IL-CHO was added on the
pretreated electrode and dried in the air. After the electrode was
washed with doubly distilled water, a 10 μL of antibody solution
(100 μg mL–1) was dropped on the electrode
modified by HCNT–CD/Fc-IL-CHO film, followed by incubation
for 60 min in the air. To remove excess antibody, the electrode was
washed with doubly distilled water. Then, a 10 μL of BSA solution
(3.0 wt %) was added on the electrode and incubated for 30 min at
37 °C to block active sites of nonspecific binding. Finally,
a 10 μL of antigen solution of different concentrations was
dropped on the surface of electrode and incubated for 40 min. After
the electrode was washed with doubly distilled water, the electrochemical
measurements were performed in 5 mM K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6]. The preparation of the immunosensor
is shown in Figure 5B.
