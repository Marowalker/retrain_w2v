Antibody–drug
conjugates are an important class of cancer
therapeutics. These agents generally bind a specific cell surface
receptor, undergo receptor-mediated endocytosis, and enter the endosomal–lysosomal
system, where the environment in these organelles facilitates the
release of a membrane-permeable cytotoxin. By using a membrane-impermeable
cytotoxin, we describe here a method that allows the cytotoxicity
of an antibody conjugate to be triggered by co-administration with
an endosome-disruptive peptide that exhibits low toxicity. This approach
was validated by conjugation of an anionic derivative of the tubulin-binding
cytotoxin colchinol methyl ether to lysine residues of the HER2-targeting
antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) via a disulfide. When this antibody
binds HER2 on SKBR3 breast cancer cells and undergoes endocytosis,
the membrane-impermeable cytotoxin is released, but it becomes trapped
in endosomes, resulting in relatively low cytotoxicity (IC50 > 1 μM). However, co-administration with an essentially
nontoxic
(IC50 > 10 μM) cholesterol-linked endosome-disruptive
peptide promotes the release of this small molecule into the cytoplasm,
conferring subnanomolar cytotoxic potency (IC50 = 0.11
± 0.07 nM). Studies of a structurally related fluorophore conjugate
revealed that the endosome-disruptive peptide does not substantially
enhance cleavage of the disulfide (t1/2 = 8 ± 2 h) within endosomes, suggesting that the mechanism
of endosomal escape involves the efflux of some small molecules without
facilitating substantial influx of reduced glutathione.

Introduction
Antibody–drug
conjugates (ADCs) are under extensive development
as targeted therapeutics.1 The approval
by the FDA and EMA of Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin, targeting CD30
in Hodgkin lymphoma)2 and Kadcyla (ado-trastuzumab
emtansine, targeting HER2 in breast cancer)3 has catalyzed numerous basic and clinical studies of a wide range
of next-generation conjugates, with particular emphasis on oncology.1 Most antibody–cytotoxin conjugates bind
internalizing cell surface receptors that cycle between the plasma
membrane and endosomes, providing a mechanism for delivery of agents
into these acidic intracellular compartments. The dissociation from
receptors in endosomes and fusion of endosomes with lysosomes exposes
these conjugates to more highly hydrolytic and acidic environments
where proteases and other enzymes can facilitate cleavage of linkers
between the protein and cytotoxin. Liberated small molecules generally
diffuse across membranes of endosomes or lysosomes and manifest cytotoxicity
by engaging targets in the cytoplasm or nucleus of cells.

Effective
ADCs must exhibit sufficient stability to reach targeted
cells but also be labile enough to release small-molecule cargo at
the target site. To attain this profile, a variety of linker structures,
including acid-labile hydrazones,4−6 noncleavable thioethers
that require extensive antibody proteolysis for release,7−10 specific protease substrates,11−13 and disulfides,14−17 have been investigated. However, variations in the rates of cleavage
of these linkers in different cell types may affect efficacy and off-target
toxicity. Additionally, ADCs may exhibit undesired toxicity by binding
cognate antigens on nontarget cells, through uptake by nontarget cells
that express Fc receptors, or via premature release of toxins that
diffuse from targeted cells into neighboring cells.18 This premature release is of greatest concern when the
toxin is highly cell-permeable. In contrast, less cell-permeable toxins
may exhibit fewer side effects,19−21 but restricting the ability to
cross membranes can also reduce engagement of intracellular targets
responsible for cytotoxicity. To better control the activities of
ADCs, chemical strategies for triggering the release of drugs from
antibodies are under investigation.22,23

One
approach that has been used to promote the release of cargo
into the cytoplasm of mammalian cells involves the disruption of intracellular
endosomes. Both natural and synthetic agents have been used to promote
the escape of entrapped molecules from these membrane-sealed compartments.24−26 This approach has been used for the delivery of nucleic acids,27,28 fluorophores,29,30 and targeted immunotoxins31 into the cytosol. We previously reported32 the synthesis of a cholesterylamine-linked peptide
that selectively disrupts membranes of early and recycling endosomes.
This peptide was used to release a disulfide derivative of fluorescein,
delivered into endosomes by conjugation to a cholesterylamine, into
the cytoplasm and nucleus. Here, we describe the use of this approach
to release cell-impermeable small molecules from endosomes delivered
as conjugates of the antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin). Trastuzumab
was particularly attractive for this strategy because when this anticancer
antibody binds its target protein HER2 on the surface of breast cancer
cells, it rapidly undergoes receptor-mediated endocytosis, but upon
delivery to early/recycling endosomes, it is predominantly recycled
back to the cell surface, and only a small fraction traffics to the
lysosome.33 Some other anticancer antibodies
such as rituximab34 are less likely to
synergize with endosome-disruptive peptides because they are not rapidly
internalized upon binding cognate cell surface antigens. As shown
in Figure 1, we reasoned
that the cytotoxicity of an impermeable cytotoxin warhead delivered
as a trastuzumab conjugate might be triggered by an endosome-disruptive
peptide, limiting the effects of the cytotoxin on nontargeted cells.
Using a cell-impermeable derivative of the cytotoxin colchinol methyl
ether (iCME) linked to trastuzumab and an optimized cholesterol-linked
endosome-disruptive peptide (Chol-EDP), we demonstrate that these
two agents show low cytotoxicity individually, but when combined,
potently kill HER2-positive SKBR3 cells, while sparing HER2-negative
MDA-MB-468 cells.

conjugate
(trastuzumab–iCME) by an endosome-disruptive peptide (Chol-EDP).
Trastuzumab–iCME alone was designed to be essentially nontoxic
(panel A) as a result of low membrane permeability of the linked colchinol
methyl ether derivative (iCME). Chol-EDP was designed to similarly
exhibit low toxicity (panel B). In combination, Chol-EDP triggers
the release of the iCME warhead into the cytoplasm (panel C), resulting
in toxicity.

Results and Discussion
Design and Synthesis
To validate the concept that a
small molecule delivered by an antibody can be released by co-administration
with an endosome-disruptive lipopeptide, we designed fluorescein disulfide
conjugates of the HER2-targeted antibody trastuzumab (1) and human IgG (2) as a nontargeted control (Figure 2). We additionally
designed a novel endosome-disruptive peptide termed here Chol-EDP
(3, Figure 2) that is structurally related to our previously reported32 cholesterylamine-modified PC4 peptide.35 Chol-EDP (3) differs from cholesterylamine-PC4
in its cholesteryl carbamate membrane anchor, the incorporation of
solubility-enhancing ethylene glycol-containing amino acids (O), and
conformationally constraining Aib (U) residues known to promote helix
formation,36 and it adds three additional
amino acids in the aromatic-rich region to better complement the 36–43
Å thickness37 of membranes of mammalian
cells. The comparison of the structures of these peptides is shown
in the Supporting Information (Figure S1).

(1, 2, panel A) and a novel cholesterol-linked
endosome-disruptive peptide (3, panel B). In panel B,
letters in bold either represent natural L-amino acids or are defined
as specific nonproteogenic amino acids.

We further designed targeted trastuzumab and nontargeted hIgG antibody
conjugates (4, 5) bearing an anionic (poorly
cell permeable) derivative of the tubulin-binding cytotoxin colchinol
methyl ether (iCME, Figure 3). These lysine conjugates include a linker containing β-alanines,
a glutamic acid residue to limit cell permeability of the small molecule,
a disulfide amino acid, and a lysine modified with Pacific Blue (PB),38 a fluorescent probe that was used for both detection
and quantification of the degree of antibody labeling (DOL). Colchinol
methyl ether (CME) is an analogue of the plant natural product colchicine.
This natural product inhibits mitosis by binding tubulin,39 and it has been previously investigated40,41 linked to tumor-targeted cytotoxins. In CME, the tropone ring of
colchicine is contracted to form a benzene. This modification increases
potency for inhibition of tubulin and decreases off-target effects.42,43 A trastuzumab conjugate that substitutes CME with the comparably
hydrophobic Pennsylvania Green (PG)44,45 fluorophore
(6) was designed as a structurally related mechanistic
probe. Analogues of CME designed to be cell-permeable (7) and cell-impermeable (8) were designed as positive
(7) and negative (8) control compounds.

Synthesis of the 5-carboxyfluorescein-disulfide-NHS ester used
to prepare antibody conjugates 1 and 2 is
described in the Experimental Section. The
synthesis of more complex NHS esters used to generate antibody conjugates 4–6 is shown in Figure 4. Deacetylcolchinol methyl ether (11) was synthesized as previously reported.46,47 Antibody conjugates 1, 2 and 4–6 were prepared by random modification of lysine
residues with NHS esters, purified by size-exclusion chromatography,
and the DOL was quantified by absorbance spectroscopy, as described
in the Experimental Section. Chol-EDP (3) was prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis, as described
in the Experimental Section.

Biological Evaluation
We previously demonstrated that
cholesterylamine-PC4 can disrupt endosomes of Jurkat lymphocyte cells
(EC50 (14 h) = 1.3 ± 0.3 μM) and release HS-fluorescein
from these compartments when cells are treated with cholesterylamine-SS-fluorescein
(structures and data shown in Figure S1, Supporting Information).32 The comparison
of cholesterylamine-PC4 with the novel analogue Chol-EDP (3) by flow cytometry revealed that 3 is ∼30-fold
more potent (EC50 (14 h) = 0.04 ± 0.01 μM) as
a disruptor of endosomes but maintains comparably low cytotoxicity
(IC50 (3, 48 h) = 11 ± 2 μM) toward
Jurkat cells (Figure S1). Because of its
enhanced potency, we used Chol-EDP (3) to investigate
effects on the HER2-targeted and nontargeted fluorescent antibody
conjugates 1 and 2. As shown in Figure 5, treatment of HER2-expressing
SKBR3 cells with these conjugates, and imaging by confocal laser-scanning
microscopy, revealed that trastuzumab-Fl (1) binds with
high affinity and specificity to cellular plasma membranes and accumulates
in intracellular compartments. Previous studies of related fluorescent
trastuzumab conjugates in SKBR3 cells have revealed a very similar
pattern of cellular and subcellular localization, where the intracellular
compartments co-localize with the early endosomal marker transferrin.33 Co-administration of 1 with Chol-EDP
(3) for 24 h resulted in fluorescence dispersed throughout
cells, a phenotype associated with the cleavage of the disulfide of 1, and escape of HS-fluorescein from endosomes into the cytosol
and nucleus. In contrast, the nontargeted hIgG-Fl (2)
conferred much lower levels of cellular fluorescence in the absence
and presence of 3 (Figure 5, compare A and C). However, the small amount of compartmentalized
intracellular fluorescence observed with hIgG-Fl (2),
presumably the result of some uptake by pinocytosis, was similarly
dispersed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus upon treatment with 3 (Figure 5, compare C and D). Similar studies of trastuzumab-Fl (1) in the HER2-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 revealed
low cellular fluorescence, consistent with the low expression of HER2
in this cell line, comparable to that observed with hIgG-Fl (2) in SKBR3 cells (Figure S2).

confocal fluorescence micrographs of living HER2+ SKBR3
cells treated with HER2-targeted (1) and nontargeted
(2) fluorescent antibody conjugates (1 μM) without
(A, C) and with (B, D) Chol-EDP (3, 2 μM) for 24
h. DOL(1) = 4.6. DOL(2) = 4.5. Scale bar
= 25 μm.

To determine whether antibody–iCME
conjugates (4, 5) might synergize with Chol-EDP
(3),
we evaluated effects on cellular viability. We reasoned that when
the targeted conjugate 4 binds HER2 on the cell surface
and undergoes endocytosis, the impermeability of the released HS-iCME
(8) product would cause its entrapment in endosomes and
lysosomes, rendering it essentially nontoxic. However, co-administration
with Chol-EDP (3) could release 8 into the
cytosol, where it could bind tubulin and block cell division. The
Pacific Blue fluorophore on the protein side of the disulfide linker
was used to quantify the average number of small molecules per antibody
(degree of labeling, DOL), confirm the extent of binding to cells
by confocal microscopy, and evaluate cellular uptake by flow cytometry
(Figure S3).

To quantify cellular
cytotoxicity, dose–response curves
for combinations of 3, 4, and 5 were generated with HER2-positive SKBR3 cells and HER2-negative
MDA-MB-468 cells after treatment for 72 h (Figure 6). As a positive cytotoxic control, cells
were treated with N-acetylcolchinol methyl ether
(7). As a cell-impermeable negative control,
the anionic CME derivative 8, predicted to result from
cleavage of the disulfide of 4 and 5 (Figure 4) was evaluated.
Under these conditions, cell-permeable 7 was highly toxic
toward both cell lines (IC50 (SKBR3) = 7 ± 5 nM; IC50 (MDA-MB-468) = 14 ± 8 nM). In contrast, the anionic
CME derivative 8 was essentially nontoxic (IC50 > 10 μM), consistent with low cellular permeability. As
expected,
the nontargeted hIgG conjugate 5 exhibited relatively
low toxicity alone (IC50 (SKBR3) > 1 μM) toward
either
cell line. When this nontargeted conjugate (5) was combined
with the essentially nontoxic Chol-EDP (3, IC50 (SKBR3) > 10 μM), held at a fixed nontoxic concentration
of
2 μM, this combination was also of relatively low toxicity (IC50 (SKBR3) ∼ 700 nM), despite the likelihood of some
uptake of this conjugate by pinocytosis. Under these same conditions,
the cytotoxicity of 8 was not substantially enhanced
by co-administration with 2 μM of Chol-EDP (IC50 (SKBR3)
∼ 7 μM; IC50 (MDA-MB-468) > 10 μM,
data
not shown). Similarly, the HER2-targeted trastuzumab conjugate 4 exhibited relatively low toxicity alone (IC50 (SKBR3) > 1 μM) toward HER2-positive SKBR3 cells and lower
toxicity toward HER2-negative MDA-MB-468 cells (IC50 (MDA-MB-468)
> 10 μM). In contrast, when SKBR3 cells were treated with
a
combination of the HER2-targeted conjugate 4 and Chol-EDP
(3, 2 μM), this combination synergistically killed
more than 90% of cells in culture with subnanomolar potency (IC50 (SKBR3) = 0.11 ± 0.07 nM), while maintaining relatively
low toxicity toward MDA-MB-468 cells under identical conditions (IC50 (MDA-MB-468) > 1 μM). Consequently, Chol-EDP (3) enhanced the toxicity of the targeted trastuzumab-iCME
(4) toward HER2+ SKBR3 cells by ∼10 000-fold,
but it did not comparably enhance the toxicity of 4 toward
HER2– MDA-MB-468 cells under the same conditions. An additional
analysis of the cellular fluorescence emitted by Pacific Blue of trastuzumab-iCME
(4) in the absence of Chol-EDP (3) revealed
subnanomolar potency of antibody uptake by SKBR3 cells (EC50 = 0.5 ± 0.2 nM, Figure S3), further
confirming potent binding to the HER2 antigen by this conjugate, despite
its low cytotoxicity alone. In conjunction with the microscopy studies
of 1–3 (Figure 5), these results support a mechanism of targeted
synergistic cytotoxicity involving binding of the trastuzumab–iCME
conjugate 4 to HER2 on SKBR3 cells, endocytosis, and
release of HS-iCME (8) from endosomes mediated by Chol-EDP
(3).

flow cytometry. DOL(4) = 5.9. DOL(5) = 5.7.

The mechanism of disruption of endosomes by Chol-EDP
(3) is not fully understood. However, based on previous
studies of
structurally related fluorescent cholesteryl carbamates48 and cholesterylamine-PC4,32 the insertion of the cholesterol moiety of this compound
into cellular plasma membranes is likely to allow it to engage an
endocytic trafficking pathway that leads to its predominant accumulation
in early and recycling endosomes. We hypothesize that the hydrophobic
peptide moiety of Chol-EDP (3) may additionally insert
into endosomal membranes to form pores that allow the escape of small
molecules from these compartments, but further studies will be necessary
to more precisely define its mechanism of action. To gain greater
insight into the effect of Chol-EDP (3) on disulfide-linked
antibody conjugates, we investigated effects on the trastuzumab–PB–PG
conjugate 6. This conjugate is structurally very similar
to 4 but it substitutes CME with Pennsylvania Green (PG),44,45 a highly fluorescent small molecule of comparable molecular size
and hydrophobicity. Importantly, like other coumarin-fluorescein pairs,49,50 fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the proximal PB fluorophore
of 6 undergoes Förster resonance energy transfer
(FRET) with PG, providing a new FRET pair that allows cleavage of
the disulfide bond between these fluorophores to be followed. When 6 was treated with the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT)
in aqueous buffer, decreased FRET between these fluorophores and reduced
fluorescence quenching resulted in enhanced blue and green fluorescence
(data shown in Figure S4). A similar increase
in blue fluorescence was also observed as the disulfide of 4 was cleaved, from decreased fluorescence quenching of PB by iCME
(Figure S4). These effects on fluorescence
allowed quantification of the half-lives associated with the cleavage
of the disulfide under pseudo-first-order conditions (t1/2 (6) = 307 ± 24 s; t1/2 (4) = 274 ± 26 s). These studies
demonstrated that the kinetics of cleavage of the disulfides of 6 and 4 are similar in aqueous buffer, but 6 additionally allows observation of the release of the green
fluorescent probe as a mimic of iCME.

Confocal microscopy and
flow cytometry were used to analyze the
time-dependent fluorescence of SKBR3 cells treated with the targeted
FRET conjugate 6 in the absence and presence of 3 (Figure 7). Immediately after addition of 6, this conjugate can
be observed bound to the plasma membrane. Over time, fluorescence
accumulates intracellularly as this conjugate is endocytosed, where
it presumably additionally returns to the cell surface via plasma
membrane recycling. Confocal micrographs showed that green fluorescence
is only released from endosomes upon treatment with both 6 and 3; cells treated with only 6 showed
exclusively compartmentalized green fluorescence, consistent with
intact endosomal membranes (Figure 7). However, unlike the smaller HS-fluorescein moiety
of 1, the green fluorescent HS-Glu-PG moiety of 6 is not as extensively trapped in the cytoplasm and nucleus
upon disruption of endosomes. We hypothesize that differential interactions
with efflux transporters might explain this difference in cellular
retention. These studies further revealed that 3 has
some effects on the subcellular trafficking of 6. In
the absence of 3, 6 is located mostly at
the cell surface with minimal accumulation in endosomes. This is consistent
with previously reported extensive endosomal recycling of HER2 back
to the plasma membrane.51,52 Co-treatment of 6 with 3 leads to greater accumulation of 6 within acidic intracellular compartments, presumably endosomes
and lysosomes, that co-localize with LysoTracker Red DND-99 (Figure S5). The mechanism underlying this increased
trafficking of the antibody conjugate to intracellular compartments
is unknown, but it may enhance the release of cargo from these acidic
compartments.

of the disulfide of 6 (DOL = 2.6) by flow cytometry.
The half-time of cleavage of the disulfide of 6 and the
extent of cleavage (±SEM) are not significantly altered by co-administration
with 3.

To quantify the rate
of cleavage of the disulfide of 6 in endosomes, and the
impact of treatment with 3, we
synthesized trastuzumab–PB–SH as a positive control
for complete cleavage of the disulfide. To prepare this control, conjugate 6 was treated with excess DTT. The trastuzumab–PB–SH
product was purified by size-exclusion chromatography to remove HS-PG
and DTT, and the loss of green fluorescence and increased blue fluorescence
was confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy (data not shown). The analysis
of a related trastuzumab–PB conjugate by flow cytometry under
the same conditions demonstrated that this treatment did not adversely
affect potency for HER2 on SKBR3 cells, but binding efficacy was reduced
by ∼17% (Figure S4), and this difference
was factored into the analysis of the kinetics of disulfide cleavage
in cells. Cells treated with trastuzumab–PB–SH were
compared with cells treated with 6 in the absence and
presence of 3 to measure the half-time of the cleavage
reaction. These studies revealed that Chol-EDP (3) does
not significantly affect the cleavage of 6 in endosomes
(t1/2 (6) = 8 ± 2 h; t1/2 (6 + 3) = 7 ±
2 h). The similarity of these values suggests that despite facilitating
the efflux of small molecules from endosomes, 3 does
not promote substantial influx of cytosolic GSH into endosomes to
promote disulfide cleavage. A similar 6 h half-life of a folate receptor-targeted
FRET probe in KB cells was previously reported by Low and co-workers.53 We found that the disulfide of 6 is maximally cleaved by ∼30% in endosomes, and this cleavage
did not increase appreciably from 24 to 72 h. When endosomes were
pre-permeabilized by treatment with 3 for 24 h prior
to addition of 6, similar results were obtained (data
not shown), further indicating a lack of association between the cleavage
of the disulfide bond and endosome disruption. This partial cleavage
is consistent with another report54 describing
less than 50% cleavage when HER2-positive breast cancer cells are
treated with trastuzumab emtansine disulfide for 20 h. Additionally,
when maytansine DM1 is conjugated to IgG via disulfide-containing
linkers, this drug is cleaved from the antibody with half-lives of
15–218 h, depending on the extent of a steric hindrance about
the disulfide bond.17,55 Other studies of trastuzumab
conjugates have indicated that recycling endosomes, late endosomes,
and lysosomes are oxidizing in SKBR3 cells, and cleavage of disulfides
can be inefficient.56 Consequently, subtle
structural elements are likely to play a major role in the cleavage
of disulfide linkers within the endosomal pathway. Other HER2-targeted
antibody conjugates cleaved by cathepsin proteases have been shown
by FRET to be cleaved by 41% after 20 h in SKBR3 cells.51

Conclusions
We report a remarkable
cytotoxic synergy between a cell-impermeable
antibody–drug conjugate and an endosome-disruptive peptide.
The trastuzumab–iCME conjugate 4 (cytotoxic IC50 (SKBR3, 72 h) > 1 μM) and endosome-disruptive peptide
Chol-EDP (3, cytotoxic IC50 (SKBR3, 72 h)
> 10 μM) exhibit relatively low toxicity individually,
but when combined potently kill more than 90% of targeted cancer
cells that express HER2 (cytotoxic IC50 (SKBR3, 72 h) =
0.11 ± 0.07 nM). Mechanistic studies of a structurally related
green fluorescent antibody conjugate support a mechanism of synergy
involving binding of these trastuzumab conjugates to HER2 on cell
surfaces, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and cleavage of the disulfide
bond in the lumen of endosomes, with a half-life of 8 ± 2 h.
When the trastuzumab–iCME conjugate 4 is added
alone, cleavage of the disulfide in endosomes yields a membrane-impermeable
thiol (HS-iCME, 8) that remains trapped in the lumen,
limiting cytotoxicity. However, when cells are treated with Chol-EDP
(3), this lipopeptide initially associates with the cellular
plasma membrane but subsequently traffics to endosomes, where it appears
to slowly permeabilize endosomal membranes (studies of the release
of fluorescence from conjugate 1 mediated by 3 indicate that substantial endosomal escape requires >8 h). This
permeabilization of endosomal membranes by Chol-EDP (3) enables the release of the highly polar HS-iCME (8), delivered by trastuzumab-iCME (4), from endosomes
into the cytoplasm and nucleus, allowing 8 to disrupt
microtubules and block cell division.

The low toxicity of Chol-EDP
(3) suggests that this
peptide may create small pores in endosomal membranes that do not
adversely affect cellular viability. However, if this mechanism is
operational, these pores must be sufficiently large to allow the escape
of HS-fluorescein and HS-iCME (8) from endosomes into
the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, studies of the structurally similar FRET
probe 6 revealed that Chol-EDP (3) does
not affect the cleavage of the disulfide of 4, suggesting
that this compound does not appear to trigger massive influx of reduced
glutathione (GSH), present in high concentrations (0.5–10 mM)57 in the cytosol, into endosomes. Because endosomes
and lysosomes have been reported to be oxidizing,56 thiol reductases58 in these
compartments presumably mediate cleavage of disulfides. Products of
proteolytic cleavage and disulfide reduction have been previously
detected in cells treated with antibody–disulfide conjugates,54 and proteolysis could potentially also contribute
to this release of cargo. We found that Chol-EDP (3)
additionally affects the trafficking and subcellular localization
of trastuzumab conjugates by increasing their accumulation in acidic
intracellular compartments, and this altered trafficking may play
a role in enhancing endosomal escape.

Given the recent interest22,23 in triggering the release
of small molecules from antibodies and previous studies of delivery
of toxins using endosome-disruptive agents,31 the approach described here has the potential to improve the properties
of ADCs. Cell-impermeable toxins that can be activated by other nontoxic
compounds may reduce side effects associated with premature release
and diffusion of toxins into nontargeted cells. Alternatively, pretargeting,
involving treatment and wash-out of the ADC followed by subsequent
administration of an endosome-disruptive peptide, might improve the
therapeutic index of some of these types of agents.

SPPS was performed
on Rink amide MBHA resin (0.5 mmol/g, 40 mg, 0.02 mmol) swelled in
DMF for 2 h. The removal of the Fmoc group was accomplished by agitating
with the deblocking solution (20% piperidine in DMF, 2 mL, 2×,
for 4 min each). The resin was washed with DMF (2 mL, 4×) to
remove any traces of piperidine and treated with Fmoc-amino acids
(4 equiv), HATU (3.8 equiv), and DIEA (8 equiv) in DMF (2 mL) with
agitation until coupling was complete by Kaiser Test (3, 6, 12, or
16 h). Once the coupling was complete, the reaction solution was drained,
and the resin was washed four times with DMF (2 mL). This coupling
protocol was repeated for each additional Fmoc-amino acid. The hindered
2-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) was coupled as the acid fluoride (Fmoc-Aib-F),
synthesized using DAST.62 Fmoc-Aib-F (4
equiv) was dissolved in DMF (0.5 mL), added to the resin, and agitated
for 6 h. Coupling to 3-((((cholester-3-yl)oxy)carbonyl)amino)propanoic
acid,59 cleavage with TFA/H2O/TIPS (95/2.5/2.5) with agitation for 2 h, and purification by RP-HPLC
provided 3 as a white solid (15 mg, 0.005 mmol, 24% overall
yield). LRMS (ESI−) m/z calcd

acid32,60 (28 mg, 0.070 mmol) was dissolved in DMF
(1 mL) containing 20% piperidine and stirred at 22 °C for 30
min. The solvent was removed under vacuum to provide the primary amine.
5-Carboxyfluorescein NHS ester (17 mg, 0.035 mmol) dissolved in dry
DMF (2 mL) was added. DIEA (0.2 mL) was added, and the reaction was
stirred at 22 °C for 16 h. The solvent was removed under vacuum,
the residue was dissolved in CH2Cl2 containing
5% methanol, applied to a short silica plug, and eluted with CH2Cl2/MeOH (9:1). The solvent was removed under vacuum
to give the crude carboxylic acid. This product (∼15 mg) was
dissolved in DMF (2 mL), and EDC (11 mg, 0.06 mmol), N-hydroxysuccinimide (7 mg, 0.06 mmol) were added. The reaction was
stirred at 22 °C for 16 h. The solvent was removed under vacuum,
the residue was dissolved in DMSO (2 mL), and the product was purified
by preparative RP-HPLC. Pure fractions were collected, combined, and
dried under vacuum to give 5-carboxyfluorescein-disulfide-NHS ester

Acid (9)
2-Chlorotrityl chloride resin (2-CTC,
Aapptec, RTZ001, 0.1 mmol) was allowed to swell in CH2Cl2 (10 min). The first Fmoc-l-amino acid (4 eq) in
dry CH2Cl2 (4 mL) containing DIEA (8 eq) was
added to the MiniBlock reactor with agitation for 16 h. The resin
was washed with CH2Cl2 (4 mL, 4×) followed
by MeOH (4 mL) with agitation (10 min) to cap any unreacted resin.
The solvent was removed, and the resin was washed with DMF (4 mL,
4×). Additional coupling steps were performed as described for
the preparation of 3 on Rink amide resin, with the exception
of the disulfide amino acid, which was added as the acid fluoride.
Briefly, Fmoc-protected 3-((2-aminoethyl)disulfanyl)propanoic acid
(80 mg, 0.2 mmol) was dissolved in dry CH2Cl2 (2 mL) in a polypropylene conical tube (15 mL). Drops of dry DMF
were added until the solution cleared, followed by the addition of
DAST (63 μL, 0.48 mmol). The reaction was stirred for 30 min
at 4 °C and was quenched by the addition of ice water. The organic
layer was washed with satd. aqueous NaCl and dried over anhydrous
Na2SO4. The crude material was concentrated
under reduced pressure and redissolved in DMF. The resulting solution
was immediately added to the resin with agitation for 16 h. Cleavage
of 9 from 2-CTC resin was accomplished by treatment with
CH2Cl2/TFE/acetic acid (7:2:1, 4 mL) with shaking
for 3 h. The resin was removed by filtration and washed with CH2Cl2 (2 mL, 3×) and DMF (2 mL, 3×). The
filtrates were combined and concentrated under vacuum to give crude
products. Purification by RP-HPLC yielded 9 as a white
solid (34 mg, 35% yield). 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6) 12.23 (brs, 1H), 8.09 (d, J = 8.1 Hz, 1H), 8.05 (t, J = 5.7 Hz, 1H), 7.94 (t, J = 5.6 Hz, 1H), 7.89 (d, J = 7.4 Hz, 3H),

Biological Assays and Protocols
SKBR3 breast cancer
cells (ATCC HTB-30) were cultured in complete media comprising DMEM
Nutrient Mixture F-12 Ham (Sigma Aldrich, D8437) supplemented with
fetal bovine serum (10%, Hyclone-characterized FBS, SH3039603), penicillin
(100 units/mL, Sigma Aldrich P4333), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL,
Sigma Aldrich P4333). MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells (ATCC HTB-132,
a kind gift of Dr. Liang Xu) were cultured in complete media comprising
DMEM (Sigma Aldrich, D6429) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%,
Hyclone-characterized FBS, SH3039603), penicillin (100 units/mL, Sigma
Aldrich P4333), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL, Sigma Aldrich P4333).
All cells were grown in T75 flasks (CytoOne CC7682-4875) and incubated
at 37 °C with 5% CO2.

Confocal Microscopy
Imaging was performed using an
inverted Leica TCS SPE confocal laser-scanning microscope fitted with
a Leica 63× oil-immersion objective. Fluorescent probes were
excited with either a 405 or 488 nm solid-state laser, and emitted
photons were collected from 425 to 500 or 500 to 600 nm. Unless otherwise
noted, laser power and PMT gain settings were identical for all images
acquired within a given experiment to allow accurate comparisons of
cellular fluorescence.

Flow Cytometry
A Beckman Coulter
Cytoflex S (B2-R0-V2-Y2)
flow cytometer was used for cellular analysis. Cells were excited
with 405 and/or 488 nm diode lasers, and emitted photons were collected
through 450/45 BP (Pacific Blue), 525/40 BP (Pennsylvania Green),
or 690/50 nm BP (PI) filters. FSC threshold was set to 500 000,
flow speed was fast, mixing and backflush times were 5 s.

Fluorescence
Spectroscopy
Fluorescence spectra were
recorded using a PerkinElmer LS-55 fluorescence spectrometer. Samples
were excited at 405 or 488 nm, and emission was recorded from 425
to 700 or 515 to 700 nm with a scan speed of 500 nm/min and slit width
of 10 nm. Samples were analyzed in a SUPRASIL macro/semimicro cell
(PerkinElmer, B0631132)

Labeling of Antibodies with NHS Esters
Trastuzumab,
obtained from a hospital pharmacy, was provided as a lyophilized powder
mixed 1:1 with stabilizers (α,α-trehalose dihydrate, L-histidine, and polysorbate 20). Human IgG was provided
as a lyophilized powder without stabilizers (Sigma, I4506). Trastuzumab
was reconstituted in sterile PBS (pH 7.4) and passed through a spin
column packed with Sephadex G-25 to remove the stabilizers. Briefly,
Sephadex G-25 resin (Superfine, Sigma, S5772) was suspended in PBS
(pH 7.4). The resulting slurry (950 μL) was added to a minispin
column (USA Scientific, 1415-0600) and centrifuged (16 000g, 20 s) to remove the buffer and pack the resin. The antibody
solution (no more than 75 μL per column) was loaded onto the
packed resin and centrifuged (16 000g, 30
s) to separate the protein from the stabilizers. The concentration
of trastuzumab was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using a Nanodrop
1000 instrument (IgG ε1% (10 mg/mL) = 13.7
L g–1 cm–1). The concentration
was adjusted to 100 μM using sterile PBS. IgG was reconstituted
in sterile PBS (pH 7.4) and the concentration determined and adjusted
as described above.

To label antibodies with NHS esters, the
IgG in PBS (100 μM, 25–300 μL) was aliquoted into
a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. NaHCO3 (aq., 1 M) was added
(2.5–30 μL) to achieve a final concentration of 0.1 M.
NHS esters were added as concentrated (typically 10 mM) DMSO stock
solutions to achieve 5- to 10-fold excess over the antibody concentration.
Solutions were incubated in a Big Shot III Hybridization oven (0.5
h, 37 °C). To purify the conjugates, Sephadex G-25 resin was
packed into columns, as described above. The antibody solution was
loaded onto the packed resin (no more than 75 μL per column)
and centrifuged (16 000g, 30 s) to separate
the protein from unconjugated small molecules. This was done twice
to ensure full removal of toxins and larger fluorophores; once was
sufficient for small fluorophores. Conjugates used for toxicity assays
or other 72 h assays were additionally sterilized by passage through
Ultra-MC centrifugal filters (0.22 μm, Millipore, UFC30GV0S)
by centrifugation (13 000g, 3 min).

After purification, the degree of labeling (DOL) of each conjugate
was determined by absorbance spectroscopy. Absorbance values at 280
and 425 or 488 nm (IgG, 280 nm ε1% (10 mg/mL) = 13.7 L g–1 cm–1, Pacific Blue,
425 nm ε = 29 500 M–1 cm–1, Fluorescein, 490 nm ε = 70 000 M–1 cm–1, Pennsylvania Green, 490 nm ε = 60 000
M–1 cm–1) were measured with a
Nanodrop 1000 Spectrophotometer to quantify the average number of
molecules per antibody. From the absorbance of 18 at
280 nm (4:1 DMSO/PBS), CME contributes an additional 30% of the absorbance
of PB at 280 nm, and the concentrations and DOL of 4 and 5 were corrected64 to account for
this contribution.

Visualization of Endosome Disruption by Confocal
Microscopy
Cells were seeded in complete media into 8-well
μ-slides
(Ibidi, 80826, 100 000 cells/mL, 300 μL/well) and allowed
to adhere overnight. Each well was washed once with media, and then
the media was replaced with complete media (150 μL) containing
vehicle control (0.1% DMSO), fluorescent conjugate, and/or EDP at
the indicated concentration. The concentrations of all DMSO stock
solutions were normalized using extinction coefficients and UV–vis
spectroscopy. Cells were incubated for 24 h, washed once with media,
and imaged by confocal microscopy.

Analysis of Cytotoxicity
SKBR3 and MDA-MB-468 cells
were used to analyze the toxicity of antibody–toxin conjugates.
Cells were plated in the appropriate complete media into CytoOne 96-well
tissue culture plates (USA Scientific, CC7682-7596) at 50 000
cells/mL (200 μL/well) and incubated for 16 h. On the same day,
IgG and trastuzumab (50 μL each) were labeled with 18 (10-fold excess), as described above, to yield 4 at
50 μM (DOL = 5.9) and 5 at 53 μM (DOL = 5.7).
The next day, DMSO stock solutions of N-acetylcolchinol
methyl ether (7, 1 mM, ε = 20 000 M–1 cm–1 at 262 nm in EtOH), Chol-EDP
(3, 10 mM, ε = 20 970 M–1 cm–1 at 280 nm in 4:1 DMSO/PBS), and HS-iCME (8, 10 mM, ε for 7 was used) were prepared
and standardized by absorbance using molar extinction coefficients.
These compounds were serially diluted 1:3 to yield 1000× DMSO
stock solutions (0.3–300 μM for 7, 10–10 000
μM for 3 and 8). These solutions were
diluted 1:1000 into complete media to yield final concentrations of
0.3–300 nM for 7 and 10–10 000 nM
for 3 and 8 (Final [DMSO] = 0.1%). Media
was aspirated from each well and replaced with this treated media
(150 μL) in triplicate. Antibody conjugates were serially diluted
in the appropriate complete media to yield solutions ranging from
0.03 to 1000 nM. Each sample was split into two equal aliquots, yielding
two sets of samples for each conjugate. Chol-EDP (3,
from a 2 mM DMSO stock solution) was added to one set of each conjugate
so cells could be co-treated with the antibody conjugate and Chol-EDP.
Media was aspirated from each well and replaced with the treated media
(150 μL) in triplicate. After incubation for 72 h, the media
was aspirated from each well, and each well was washed with PBS (100
μL). Cells were trypsinized by addition of 50 μL of trypsin
to each well and incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. Trypsin was
quenched with media (150 μL) containing propidium iodide (PI,
3 μM from a 3 mM PBS stock solution, Thermo Fisher Scientific,
P1304MP), and cells in each well were pipetted repeatedly to break
up clumps. Plates were immediately analyzed using a Beckman Coulter
Cytoflex S (B2-R0-V2-Y2) flow cytometer. Cells were collected for
20 s per well. Other settings are described under Flow Cytometry. Light scattering and staining with PI were
used to identify populations of living cells. Counts of viable cells
for each treatment, determined in triplicate, were used to generate
dose–response curves. These curves were fitted by nonlinear
regression with an inhibitor vs response 3-parameter model (GraphPad
Prism 8) to determine IC50 values.

Analysis of SKBR3 Cells
Treated with 6 by Confocal Microscopy
as a Function of Time
SKBR3 cells were plated in complete
media onto 8-well μ-slides (Ibidi, 80826, 125 000 cells/mL,
300 μL/well) and allowed to adhere for 16 h. Each well was washed
once with media. The media was replaced with complete media (100
μL) containing antibody conjugate 6 (1 μM)
with or without 3 (2 μM). Additional controls shown
in Figures S1 and S2 used cholesterylamine-SS-fluorescein32 (250 nM) as a fluorescent probe to further confirm
the endosome-disruptive activity of 3 in a given set
of experiments. Cells were incubated at 4 °C for 0.5 h. Cells
were washed twice with media (with the exception of cells treated
with cholesterylamine-SS-fluorescein,32 which diffuses away over time), and the media was replaced with
media (300 μL), containing 3 (2 μM) where
appropriate. Cells were immediately imaged as described in Confocal Microscopy for the t = 0 time point. Cells were incubated at 37 °C prior to imaging
for all other time points.

Analysis of SKBR3 Cells Treated with 6 by
Flow Cytometry as
a Function of Time
SKBR3 cells were plated in complete media
into CytoOne 96-well tissue culture plates (USA Scientific, CC7682-7596)
at 75 000 cells/mL (200 μL/well) and incubated overnight
(16 h). On the same day, trastuzumab (300 μL) was labeled with 19 (4-fold excess) as described above to yield 6 at 62 μM (DOL = 2.6). As a fully cleaved control, trastuzumab–PB–SH
was prepared from 6 by the addition of DTT (1 mM) to 6 followed by incubation (37 °C) in a Big Shot III Hybridization
Oven (2 h). Fluorescence emission was monitored, and the reaction
was allowed to proceed until the fluorescence stopped increasing (Figure S6). The solution was purified using Sephadex
G-25 and filter sterilized as described above to yield trastuzumab–PB–SH
(58 μM, DOL = 2.0). Trastuzumab (75 μL each) was additionally
labeled on lysines with only Pennsylvania Green NHS ester or Pacific
Blue NHS ester (2-fold excess of each) to produce trastuzumab-PG (70
μM, DOL 1.5) and trastuzumab–PB (62 μM, DOL 1.7)
as additional controls to assure spectral orthogonality in both confocal
microscopy and flow cytometry experiments (data not shown).

The next day, sufficient antibody conjugate (1 μM) in media
was prepared with and without 3 (2 μM) to dose
wells in triplicate (100 μL) and obtain 8 time points. Media
was also prepared with Cholesterylamine-SS-Fluorescein32 (250 nM) with and without 3 (2
μM) as a positive control to confirm endosome disruption by 3 (data not shown). The media was aspirated from the wells
and replaced with this treated media (100 μL) in triplicate.
Cells were incubated at 4 °C for 0.5 h. Cells were then washed
once with media, and the media was replaced with media (200 μL),
containing 3 (2 μM) where appropriate. Wells corresponding
to time point t = 0 were immediately trypsinized
as described in Analysis of Cytotoxicity, with the exception that PI was not added. Cells were analyzed as
described in Flow Cytometry. Cells were
incubated at 37 °C until the next time point.

To determine
the half-life of the release of the Pennsylvania Green
derivative from 6, median blue fluorescence values from
each well were collected. The values of 6 with and without 3 were multiplied by 0.83 to correct for the lower efficacy
of binding of trastuzumab–PB for HER2 after treatment with
DTT compared to 6. These values were divided by the corresponding
values of trastuzumab–PB–SH (as a control for complete
cleavage of 6) with and without 3. These
ratios were then normalized using the value at t =
0 as representative of 0% cleavage and a ratio of one as representative
of 100% cleavage. The half-life was determined by curve fitting using
a one-phase association model (GraphPad Prism 8). The normalized ratios
of each time point with and without 3 were compared using
unpaired t tests (one per time point) with the assumption
that all data were sampled from populations with the same scatter
using the Holm–Sidak method (α = 5%). The differences
in half-lives with and without 3 were not significant.
