As
a prerequisite to the development of real label-free bioassay
applications, a high-throughput top–down nanofabrication process
is carried out with a combination of nanoimprint lithography, anisotropic
wet-etching, and photolithography methods realizing nanoISFET arrays
that are then analyzed for identical sensor characteristics. Here,
a newly designed array-based sensor chip exhibits 32 high aspect ratio
silicon nanowires (SiNWs) laid out in parallel with 8 unit groups
that are connected to a very highly doped, Π-shaped common source
and individual drain contacts. Intricately designed contact lines
exert equal feed-line resistances and capacitances to homogenize the
sensor response as well as to minimize parasitic transport effects
and to render easy integration of a fluidic layer on top. The scalable
nanofabrication process as outlined in this article casts out a total
of 2496 nanowires (NWs) on a 4 inch p-type silicon-on-insulator (SOI)
wafer, yielding 78 sensor chips based on nanoISFET arrays. The sensor
platform exhibiting high-performance transistor characteristics in
buffer solutions is thoroughly characterized using state-of-the-art
surface and electrical measurement techniques. Deploying a pH sensor
in liquid buffers after high-quality gas-phase silanization, nanoISEFT
arrays demonstrate typical pH sensor behavior with sensitivity as
high as 43 ± 3 mV·pH–1 and a device-to-device
variation of 7% at the wafer scale. Demonstration of a high-density
sensor platform with uniform characteristics such as nanoISFET arrays
of silicon (Si) in a routine and refined nanofabrication process may
serve as an ideal solution deployable for real assay-based applications.

Introduction
Nanoscale ion-sensitive
field-effect transistors (nanoISFETs) as
the centerpiece of modern electrochemical sensing platforms attract
a relentless pursuit to develop new label-free assays for real biomedical
applications and other similar fields.1−7 In recent years, the discovery of low-dimensional material systems
and their integration onto electrical sensor platforms using novel
nanofabrication methods have dramatically improved the capabilities
of nanoISFETs, such as improved sensitivity, selectivity, and ability
for analyte multiplexing.6−15 Prototype studies in recent years have focused on the use of semiconductor
nanowires (semi-NWs), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene-based materials
(GBMs), and two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor materials as high surface-to-volume
ratio electrical transducers with versatile surface characteristics
for realizing ultrafast and label-free detection of biomolecules.16−25 On the basis of current trends in the development of nanoISFET-based
sensor platforms and bioassays, it is suggested that label-free detection
approaches may soon provide breakthroughs in the field of in vitro
diagnostics (IVD) and compete against otherwise tedious and expensive
bioanalytical methods involving preamplification of analytes, for
example, polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assays (ELISAs).3,26−30

Although label-free nanoISFET platforms mentioned
above outdo current
bioanalytical tools in terms of sensor performance, the deployment
of candidate nanomaterials for mainstream applications largely depends
on the possibility of scaling up their respective nanofabrication
processes. Despite increasing knowledge in molecular biology techniques
and the discovery of new biomarkers, lack of cost-effective and near-industry
fabrication for many of the high-performance nanoISFET platforms hampers
the development pace of novel bioassay technologies.31 Optimization of new bioassay techniques before going through
clinical testing and final implementation in the respective biomedical
fields critically requires limiting the number of specific clinical
tests during the developmental phases to reduce the overall costs.32−34 Here, the silicon (Si)-based technology offers a unique opportunity
for well-established nanofabrication methods and control over material
properties and their impressive track-record toward the development
of novel biosensor concepts.2,35−38 More recently, Si-based biosensor platforms have been deployed for
bioassay optimization in a variety of near-clinical studies using
nucleic acids, antibodies, and enzymes as analyte biomarkers.28,39−42 Additionally, Si-based ISFETs have been a workhorse for studying
live cell signals using different signal acquisition approaches and
are identified as a potential platform for drug-discovery and diagnostic
applications.22,43 With this immense know-how in
biosensor development, Si-based nanoISFETs are more than ever facilitating
the development of new, label-free electronic assays, their optimization,
and final implementation for real diagnostic applications.

In
the context of high-throughput use and efficient clinical analysis
of new bioassays, here we demonstrate a new approach for the high-density
fabrication of nanoISFET arrays of Si in a top–down approach
and analyze uniformity of their sensor characteristics over the wafer
scale. A mixed nanofabrication process involving nanoimprint lithography,
anisotropic wet-chemical etching, and photolithography processes is
worked out on a 4 inch silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer where a total
of 2496 enhanced-mode nanoISFET are fabricated and distributed over
78 individual sensor chips. Sensor chips are specially designed in
a dip-chip configuration where 32 individually addressable high aspect
ratio nanoISFETs are connected to a Π-shaped common source and
individual drain contact lines. The source and drain contact lines
are intricately designed and highly doped to exert equal capacitance
and resistance for each channel and to minimize the parasitic transport
effects. Thorough characterization of nanoISFET arrays reveals highly
uniform surface and transport characteristics with minimal device-to-device
variations in sensor properties. Randomly chosen and deployed as a
pH sensor in liquids, nanoISFETs showed pH sensitivity as high as
43 ± 3 mV·pH–1 with a device-to-device
variation of around 7%. Ascribing the highly uniform sensor characteristics
of our nanoISFET arrays to an optimized top–down fabrication
approach reinforced by special design and adequate property considerations
for contact lines, we demonstrate a very reliable and versatile platform
to analyze complex label-free bioassays.

Results and Discussion
The realization of a nanoISFET array-based sensor platform began
with the consideration of the need for a high-throughput and multiplex
sensor platform with multiple readout possibility from identical sensor
sites on a chip. At first, we designed a nanoimprint lithography mold
for our nanoISFET arrays-based sensor chips using a graphics program
(Clewin) to be realized on a 5 inch Si wafer with a 200 nm SiO2 layer on top using e-beam lithography and a dry-etching process
(Institute of Microelectronics Stuttgart, Germany). Figure 1A shows the layout of an individual
sensor chip measuring 10 × 7 mm2 where 32 high aspect
ratio SiNWs are positioned in an array form in the group of 4, making
8 unit groups, that is, 32 individually addressable sensor sites.
An individual unit group is shown on the right in the zoomed-in view
taken from the layout where 15 micron long SiNWs are separated by
a 5 micron distance. The NW units are separated by 250 microns so
as to later on facilitate selective deposition of biomolecules for
bioassay applications using microspotting techniques.44 Sensor signals from the four nanoISFETs of a unit could
then be averaged to improve the reliability of the assay readout.
The NWs are connected to a common Π-shaped source electrode
in a special configuration to allow the positioning of nanoISFET arrays
closer to the edge of the sensor chip, which is advantageous for the
deployment of chips in a “dip-chip” configuration, as
well as to facilitate easy integration of a fluidic platform on top.
To facilitate parallel readout and multiplexing capabilities, each
nanoISFET is connected to individual drain electrodes.
To avoid sensor characteristic variances coming from parasitic capacitances
and contact-line resistances, drain electrodes are intricately designed
to keep the total capacitance and inline resistance values identical
for all 32 nanoISFET arrays. The sheet resistance and capacitance
of the contact lines were calculated using a theoretical model for
charge-carrier doping in Si (see Supporting Information). Figure 1B shows
a photograph of a 4 inch SOI wafer with 78 sensor chips coming out
at the end of the fabrication process. The nanofabrication process
for the realization of nanoISFET arrays is outlined in Figure 2. 8 inch SOI wafers (SOI-Prime-8-880/1450Å)
with an 88 nm Si layer and 145 nm SiO2 layer were procured
from Soitec, France. The SOI wafers were then laser-cut into 4 inch
wafers at WINFAB in Catholic University Louvain and cleaned following
a standard protocol using the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) procedure.
Ellipsometry measurements were carried out in our lab on these wafers,
which confirmed the top Si layer thickness of 87 nm and a buried oxide
(BOX) thickness of 145 ± 6 nm (see Supporting Information). The wafers are of prime quality grown using low
boron (p-type) doping, resistivity values ranging from 8 to 22 Ω·cm,
and a crystal orientation of ⟨100⟩. Before processing
the wafers, the top Si layer was thinned down using thermal oxidation
(hard mask growth) to reach a thickness of 67 nm with an oxide thickness
of 45 nm, which was confirmed by ellipsometry measurements (see Supporting Information). A thinned-down SOI wafer
as shown in Figure 2i is spin-coated with nanoimprint thermal resist MR9030 (purchased
from Micro Resist Technology GmbH) to get a 700 nm thick layer and
baked for 2 min at 100 °C to remove any moisture. The imprint
on this thermal resist was carried out by pressing the stamp against
the resist layer at 95 °C for 900 s at 50 bar pressure and demolding
at 40 °C. A mirror pattern now imprinted into the resist layer
(Figure 2ii) is then
used as a mask for structuring the 45 nm thick SiO2 layer
underneath in the next step. The imprinted residual layer of the thermal
resist is now dry-etched using a reactive-ion etching (RIE) process
in 20 sccm O2 at 100 W and 2 Pa for 240 s (Figure 2iii). The etching process is
continued to transfer the pattern onto the SiO2 layer underneath
(RIE is carried out in 30 sccm CHF3 at 200 W and 3 Pa for
100 s) (Figure 2iv).
The thus patterned SiO2 layer is now used as a hard mask
for structuring the underlying Si layer, where an anisotropic wet-etching
is carried out by the use of tetramethylammoniumhydroxide (TMAH) solution
(Figure 2v).45,46 With the culmination of this anisotropic wet-etching, the SiNWs
and contact-line patterns on the mold are finally transferred onto
the thin Si top layer of the SOI wafer and result in parallel production
of high aspect ratio SiNW-arrays. For Si layer etching, first the
wafers are cleaned with fresh piranha solution for 10 min followed
by dipping them into 1% hydrogen fluoride (HF) solution for 120 s
to remove the left over hard mask. Etching is carried out by dipping
the wafers into 25% TMAH solution at 90 °C for 60 s. This series
of etching processes transfers the mold design onto the top Si layer
of the SOI wafers. The structured top Si layer of SOI wafers cast
out into NW arrays exhibits semiconductor characteristics with resistivity
around 8–22 Ω·cm. In the next step, the source and
drain contact lines patterned in the top Si layer connecting NWs to
external contacts were p-doped (boron) using an ion-implantation
process (Ion Beam Services Peynier, France). Doping of contact lines
helps to reduce the serial resistances while retaining the high carrier
mobility of the Si nanowire (SiNW) channels.46 The doping process is controlled by the ion-implantation energy,
dose, and thickness of the passivation layer on the SiNW region. The
ion implantation energy defines the projection range in the Si layer
calculable from the Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter (SRIM) program
based on the quantum mechanical treatment of the ion–atom collision.47 An ion projection of 40 nm was targeted to have
only the top Si layer implanted, where an implantation energy of 10
keV was calculated with an implantation dose of 1015 atoms/cm2 with irradiation at a 7° tilt (see Supporting Information). To carry out implantation of contact
lines, a photolithography step was performed to passivate the SiNW
arrays by a photoresist layer as protection from ion implantation.
After implantation, ions were activated by a high-temperature annealing
step at 850 °C for 30 min under a nitrogen atmosphere followed
by thermal dry oxide (SiO2) layer generation on the Si
surface at 810 °C for 45 min, which measured around 8 nm and
also worked as a gate dielectric (Figure 2vi). Finally, a UV photolithography step
covered the contact lines and contact pad areas with a metal layer
composed of Al (150 nm), Ti (20 nm), and Au (200 nm) as inferred from Figure 2vii. After the metal
evaporation, wafers were annealed in a vacuum at 350 °C for 10
min to ensure good electrical contacts. The deposition of metals on
the contact line ensures low resistance for charge carriers flowing
out of the nanoISFET arrays.46

and liftoff, and (viii) resulting 7 × 10 mm dip-chip layouts

Structural characterization of nanoISFET arrays is shown
in Figure 3. Figure 3A shows an optical
image from
a portion of the sensor chip after carrying out the nanoimprint process
where four units are shown with four identical SiNWs each. Figure 3B shows a scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) image of a unit performed on a Zeiss Supra
40 microscope where SiNWs are seen connected to a common source and
individual drain contact lines. Also from Figure 3A,B, it is quite clear that after optimization
of the nanoimprint process results in homogeneous filling of the thermoresist
in all of the micro- and nano-features of the mold. Figure 3C shows a zoomed-in SEM image
of four Si high aspect ratio SiNW arrays coming out of our nanoimprint
lithography process. The NW arrays are 15 micron long and lie parallel
to each other with a 5 micron spacing in between. The NW surfaces
appear very smooth and identical in structural details, which is further
highlighted in a higher-resolution SEM scan shown in Figure 3D. The SEM image details the
finer structural details of the SiNWs resulting after the wet-etching.
TMAH etches Si anisotropically because of a lower etching rate at
the ⟨111⟩ plane than that of other planes, therefore
resulting in a trapezoidal cross-section.45 This provides a precisely controllable mechanism and results in
smooth surfaces with low defects. From the detailed SEM and AFM (Veeco
Dimensions 3100) characterization (Figure 3E), individual SiNWs are measured in width
at 126 nm on the top side and 340 nm at the base. As inferred from
the AFM scan image, SiNWs have a total height of 160 nm, which is
known from our process because of the etching of BOX. Therefore, the
SiNW arrays are elevated from the BOX floor leading to an almost “wrapped
around gate” configuration.48

Figure 4 describes
the characterization of nanoISFET arrays of Si realized in this newly
optimized nanofabrication process for liquid sensing applications
using the electrochemical gate configuration. Figure 4A shows a nanoISFET arrays-based sensor chip
mounted on a specially designed printed circuit board (PCB) where
the source and drain contacts on the chip are wire bonded to connect
to the electrical measurement system. The chip was assembled with
a fluidic reservoir of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS Sylgard 184) to
facilitate the handling of liquid solutions during the measurements.
All measurements were performed on a semiconductor parameter measurement
setup (Keithley 4200 SCS). Figure 4B shows the circuit diagram of the measurement setup
for ISFET arrays in a three-electrode configuration. An electrochemical
electrode made of silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) was used as a reference
electrode (450 μm Dri-Ref from WPI Europe). All of the electrical
characteristic measurements were carried out in a 10 mM phosphate
buffer (PB) at pH 7. Figure 4C shows the output characteristics of an individual nanoISFET
as shown in Figure 3. Here, the source–drain bias (Vds) was swept between 0 to −2.0 V, and the bias at the Ag/AgCl
reference electrode (Vg) was applied from
0.0 to −1.4 V in steps of −0.2 V. For an enhancement-mode
field-effect device, there is no drain current (Ids) passing at Vg = 0 V, which
is below the threshold voltage (Vth).
When the bias voltage applied at the reference electrode is greater
than the threshold voltage (Vg > Vth), Ids increases
and shows linear behavior at low drain–source bias values.
The linear behavior of Ids at low bias
is explained by Ids α (Vg – Vth)Vds, while at larger drain–source bias, a saturation
condition is achieved as explained by Ids α (Vg – Vth)2. Figure 4D shows the exemplary transfer characteristics of a
typical SiNW at a linear scale where Vg is varied from 0 to −3 V and Vds voltage is varied from 0.0 to −3.0 V in steps of −0.5
V. The SiNW arrays presented p-type enhancement-mode transistor characteristics.
The p-type enhancement-mode output characteristics of
the nanoISFET arrays result from the charge-carrier depletion in the
SiNW structure compared to the highly implanted drain and source contacts.
Unlike in standard metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor
(MOSFET) structures, the hole carriers in the SOI structure cannot
be recruited from the substrate. Here, the carrier injection and enhancement
of charge-carrier density are occurring from the source and drain
contacts into the fully depleted SiNWs.

field-effect characteristics where the sensor chip is mounted on a

buffers. (B) Circuit diagram of the measurement setup, (C) current–voltage
output characteristics of a typical p-type nanoISFET, and (D) typical
transfer characteristics of a nanoISFET in buffer solution.

After the basic characterization
for the operational range of the
SiNW arrays, we deployed them as pH sensors to ascertain the sensor
characteristics, reproducibility, and random variation in their sensor
characteristics. SiNW array chips were chosen randomly and surface-modified
with pH-sensitive molecules by employing a gas-phase silanization
method.49 The chips were cleaned in a piranha
solution (1:3 ratio of H2O2 and H2SO4) for 10 min at 60 °C to have a high density of
hydroxyl groups on the NW surface before being subjected to the silanization
process. The silanization process was carried out inside of a vacuum
atmosphere where 200 μL of 3-glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane
(GPTES) or 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) was injected into
a container tube connected to a vacuum chamber where SiNW arrays were
placed in an oxygen-free environment as shown in the schematic of Figure 5A. The vacuum chamber
was then heated up to 80 °C, and the silanization process was
performed for 2 h and 30 min. After silanization, chips were cleaned
with deionized (DI) water to remove excess silane. In this surface
functionalization process, silane molecules assembled themselves on
the SiNWs by forming a bond with the hydroxyl groups present on the
NW surface. The gas-phase silanization methods are better suited for
realizing highly homogeneous self-assemblies of molecular layers over
large surface areas against other protocols.49 It is known that upon functionalization of oxide surfaces with aminosilanes,
the pH-sensing mechanism based on protonation and deprotonation of
functional groups moved from being exclusively based on hydroxyl groups
to a combination of amino (−NH2) and hydroxyl (−OH)
groups present at the surface, representing a variety of surface densities
and dissociation constants at a particular pH. At low pH values, the
amino group was protonated to NH3+, and at high
pH values, SiOH was deprotonated to −SiO–, leading to an almost linear relation of surface charge with pH.

functionalization of nanoISFET arrays is carried out by using candidate
silanes such as APTES and GPTES in a gas-phase silanization technique.

(D) mapping threshold response of nanoISFET arrays measured at pH
7 before and after the silanization process, and (E) histogram showing
variations in the threshold voltage at pH 7 before and after the silanization
process.

Field-effect characteristics of
silanized nanoISFETs in buffer
at pH 7 are shown in Figure 5B where −100 mV bias (Vds) was applied, whereas Vg was swept from
0 to −1 V. To ascertain device-to-device variations in sensor
characteristics, we took the Vth of the
nanoISFETs at pH 7 as a reference. Vth is extracted from the output characteristics for all of the devices
measured. The threshold voltage of nanoISFETs is calculated by implementing
a transconductance (gm) extrapolation
method where the first derivative of Id (dId/dVg) is plotted against Vg as shown in Figure 5C.50 (see Supporting Information)
From the gm values in buffer solutions,
the field-effect mobility (μ) of the ISFET arrays is calculated
at around 1.97 cm2/V·s. The threshold response (Vth values) of 54 randomly chosen nanoISFET arrays
is shown in Figure 5D before and after GPTES silanization. Upon silanization of SiO2 surfaces with GPTES, the total negative surface charge on
the nanoISFETs is expected to decrease because of the replacement
of the hydroxyl groups with glycidoxy groups, requiring a higher negative
gate voltage to “switch on” the device and therefore
an increase in the threshold voltage.51 Interestingly, some of the nanoISFET
arrays exhibit an aberration as shown in Figure 5D for channels from no. 26 to 45, the reasons
for which are discussed in detail in the Supporting Information, which potentially arises from the variations in
effective channel lengths. On average, as shown in Figure 5E, Vth values of nanoISFET arrays before and after the silanization process
were calculated at 384 ± 106 and 395 ± 76 mV, respectively,
accounting for device-to-device variations of 27.6 and 17.2%. The
overall increase in the threshold voltage upon GPTES functionalization
of the nanoISFETs stays in agreement with the theoretical interpretations.51 In addition to slight variations in sensor characteristics
coming from the mask-alignment process as discussed in detail in the Supporting Information, inherent factors of the
nanofabrication such as the dopant concentration variation during
the implantation step, variation in the gate oxide thickness, and
fixed charges over the wafer may play a crucial role in determining
the homogeneity of sensor characteristics.52,53

Furthermore, nanoISFET arrays are deployed for the measurement
of output characteristics at a drain–source bias of −100
mV and sweeping the voltage at the reference electrode from 0 to −1.0
V while changing the buffer solutions from pH values 5 to 9 to evaluate
(Figure 6B) the pH
sensor response and variation as a basis for future bioassay applications.
On the basis of these measurements, the pH sensitivity of the nanoISFET
arrays is plotted in Figure 6C as the change (ΔVth) in
buffer solutions at different pH values. A linear pH response with
small error bars is observed, showing highly reproducible sensor characteristics
with pH sensitivity as high as 43 ± 3 mV/pH accounting for only
a 7% device-to-device variation. The pH sensitivity of the nanoISFET
arrays as presented here is comparable to that of the other NW-based
platforms reported in the literature.54−57 It is documented that ISFETs
with bare SiO2 surfaces exhibit a sensor response on the
order of 34 mV/pH, which may increase up to 45 mV/pH with the modification
of the oxide surface with functional molecules such as APTES.56 High-throughput clinical analysis of novel bioassays
is critical to the development of label-free IVD and other related
applications where a closely knit sensor response from a high-density
sensor platform such as the nanoISFET arrays of Si realized in this
work may provide an appropriate platform. Although high-performance
and precise sensor characteristics were achieved, we took a closer
look at the different factors that may be playing a role in the tiny
variations of the pH response from nanoISFET arrays, which will be
investigated and rectified in further work (see Supporting Information). Going a step further toward the application
of such sensor platforms for point-of-care (PoC) applications, we
connected our nanoISFET arrays to a portable hand-held readout system
for field-effect-based biosensor arrays which was recently developed
in our group.56Figure 6A shows the photograph of this portable measurement
setup where the sensor chip is mounted on a PCB and connected to the
four-channel miniaturized readout system built around a 32 bit PIC
microcontroller and equipped with a user-friendly readout software
designed in LabView communicating with the hardware to record and
display the electrical measurements on a computer screen or any other
device. The sensor chip is also equipped with a fluidic layer to facilitate
pH sensor measurements in real time for longer periods. Figure 6D shows an exemplary real-time
sensor measurement while going through multiple cycles of changing
buffer solutions with pH values ranging from 4 to 10. In these measurements,
nanoISFET arrays were operated at maximum sensitivity, that is, applying Vg corresponding to maximum transconductance
values at a given bias Vd (−1 V).
For the measurement shown in Figure 6D, −1.5 V Vg was
applied and Id was recorded. The Id values were converted to equivalent gate voltage
values and plotted against time while changing the buffer solutions.
The nanoISFET arrays were generally operated for more than an hour
and exhibited a stable sensor response over multiple cycles. An average
pH response from 5 nanoISFET arrays in the form of an average equivalent
gate voltage change (ΔVgs) is plotted
in Figure 6E, which
is demonstrating the portability of our nanoISFET array sensor system.
This platform can now be applied for future point of care applications.

of different pH values.

Conclusions
A new near-industry
nanofabrication process is optimized for the
realization of nanoISFET arrays of Si for assay-based applications.
Sensor chips with 32 individually addressable nanoISFET are fabricated
by combining nanoimprint lithography, photolithography, and anisotropic
wet-chemical etching methods. Special configurations of nanoISFET
arrays with highly doped contact lines ensure identical sensor characteristics
and result in the assembly of a sensor platform with reliable, high-performance,
and near-identical sensor characteristics. Deploying as pH sensors,
nanoISFET arrays of Si demonstrate exemplary sensor characteristics
with pH sensitivity as high as 43 ± 3 mV/pH and a device-to-device
variation of 7%. Finally coupled with a hand-held readout system,
the sensor platform demonstrates the potential for real-time sensor
measurement capabilities in liquids. Wafer scale realization of a
high-density sensor platform as demonstrated in this article may in
