In this work, a hollow LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (H-NCM) nanosphere
cathode with excellent
electrochemical performance is developed for lithium-ion batteries.
Preparation of the H-NCM nanospheres involves the sacrificial template
method, in which carbon nanospheres work as the template and polyvinylpyrrolidone
works as an additive. Structural and morphological analyses show that
the as-prepared H-NCM nanospheres are highly uniform with diameters
of approximately 50 nm and wall thicknesses of 10 nm. Electrochemical
tests demonstrate that the H-NCM cathode not only manifests outstanding
rate performance in the potential window of 2.5–4.5 V with
high reversible specific capacities of 205.6, 194.9, 177.8, 165.9,
151.7, 126.0, and 115.3 mA h g–1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5,
1, 2, 5, and 10 C, respectively, but also delivers excellent stability
with a capacity retention of 60.1% at 10 C after 2000 cycles. The
superior electrochemical performance of the H-NCM cathode can be put
down to the distinctive hollow interior structure with thin nanostructured
walls, which can synergistically benefit the significantly enhanced
rate capability and cycling stability.

Introduction
Inspired by the high
gravimetric and volumetric energy density
of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), electrification devices and electrical
vehicles based on LIBs have aroused considerable interest.1−4 Nevertheless, current cathode materials (e.g., LiCoO2, LiNiO2, or LiFePO4) cannot meet the ever-increasing
demand of high energy and high power; therefore, development of high-performance
cathode materials has proven to be challenging. Among these materials,
LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM),
a layered lithium transition metal oxide, has drawn much attention
mainly on account of its high reversible capacities, high energy density,
moderate voltage platform, thermal stability, and inexpensive price.5−8 Although implemented in numerous studies, certain drawbacks of the
NCM hinder their sustainability and high-power applications, including
phase deterioration that exists during the lithium-ion (Li+) insertion/extraction and morphological changes of the active electrode
materials during the charging–discharging process.9

To solve above problems, hollow-structured
materials have been
proposed and received considerable attention.10 Benefitting from the merits of large specific surface area, great
“breathability”, large void space, and good monodispersity,
hollow spheres of the nanometer or micrometer dimensions, by virtue
of their unique morphology with controllable size, shell composition,
and internal structure, manifest physical and chemical advantages
compared with conventional solid counterparts.11 They also present promising application prospects in diverse
fields, such as drug delivery, energy storage devices, catalysis,
nanoreactors, and sensors.12,13 Generally, nanostructures
with hollow interiors could augment the electrochemical performances
of electrode materials through various mechanisms, such as by reducing
the effective diffusion distance for Li+ and by affording
a large surface area that could in turn act as a larger reactive interface
for the Li+ storage.14−17

Recently, considerable progress has been engaged
in the exploration
of synthesis of hollow micro-/nanostructures based on templates to
improve properties.18−23 Wu et al. devised a nanoporous LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode material via vapor-grown carbon
fibers as templates, which presented ultrafast charge capability at
180 C as well as good cycling stability.24 Qian et al. designed an in situ template-sacrificial route to prepare
LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 hollow
microspheres with porous spinel Mn1.5Co1.5O4 hollow microspheres as the template, which achieve a high
discharge capacity of 120.5 mA h g–1 at 0.5 C after
200 cycles.8 Cao and co-workers reported
LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 hollow
nano-/micro-hierarchical microspheres (NCM-HS) and cube-shaped hierarchical
LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (CH-NCM)
that were synthesized using MnCO3 microspheres and cubes
as self-templates.7,25 Both NCM-HS and CH-NCM cathodes
displayed augmented electrochemical performances. The unique hollow
nanostructures endow the electrode material with a short transport
length for Li+ insertion/extraction and good structural
stability, yielding outstanding rate capability and cycling stability.
Although great progress has been made in hollow NCM (H-NCM) materials,
it is highly desirable to prepare a nano-sized H-NCM cathode with
significantly enhanced electrochemical performances for LIBs, which
still remains a grand challenge.

Herein, we demonstrate a scalable
strategy to prepare uniform H-NCM
nanospheres with carbon nanospheres as the template. The carbon nanospheres
are saturated with desired metal salts in a unified polyol system
and a “deep penetration–calcination” process
for the formation of uniform H-NCM nanospheres. In the calcination
process, the template serves to not only form a cavity but also effectively
avoid particle aggregation. When evaluated as a cathode material for
LIBs, the unique H-NCM electrode exhibits outstanding rate capability,
long-term cycling stability, and high discharge capacity, achieving
205.6 mA h g–1 at 0.1 C. At higher rates, the reversible
capacities of the H-NCM cathode are, respectively, 194.9 (0.2 C),
177.8 (0.5 C), 165.9 (1 C), 151.7 (2 C), 126.0 (5 C), and 115.3 mA
h g–1 (10 C).

Results and Discussion
The overall procedure for the synthesis of H-NCM nanospheres is
illustrated in Figure 1. First, carbon nanospheres were prepared from glucose under hydrothermal
conditions according to a reported procedure.26 The hydrothermal process resulted in the formation of a large amount
of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the carbonization particles. The
presence of carboxyl groups renders the carbon nanospheres negatively
charged, which possess a strong bonding ability with cationic metal
ions by electrostatic attractions. Second, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP),
as a noted coordination agent via −N and/or C=O functional
groups, combines metal ions and can self-assemble into micelles, which
can be used as soft templates.27 Subsequently,
carbon nanospheres were well-dispersed in a PVP–ethylene glycol
(EG) solution of acetate solutions of different metal ions. The solution
was heated up to 120 °C for 12 h and 170 °C for another
2 h under reflux to enable deep penetration. In the initial stage
of refluxing, the acetate groups of M(CH3COO)2 precursors were replaced gradually by EG units through the formation
of M–O– covalent and M←OH coordination bonds.28 Therefore, M-glycolate (MG) would be observed
in both the internal and external surfaces of carbon nanospheres during
this process.29 Afterward, lithium acetate
was introduced to the carbon nanospheres@MG hybrid by grinding. The
thus-formed mixture was treated at 550 °C for 4 h and finally
calcined at 850 °C for another 8 h in air. The use of carbon
nanospheres as hard templates and of PVP as soft templates as well
as the formation of MG plays central roles in the generated process
of H-NCM nanospheres. Apart from the carbon nanospheres and its oxygen-containing
functional groups that constitute the carbon nanospheres@MG hybrid,
there are a large fraction of organic species including PVP, CH3COO–, and partially polymerized EG.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration
of the preparation of H-NCM nanospheres.

Indeed, the compositional changes associated with calcination
are
also traced using the TGA. Figure 2 shows the TGA curve recorded under a flow of air at
20 °C min–1 in the temperature range between
30 and 900 °C, indicating a significant weight loss of around
50.6%. A three-stage pattern of weight loss is noted in the temperature
ranges of 25–200, 200–340, and 340–900 °C.
The first stage of weight loss (7.5%) could be ascribed to physically
adsorbed water and evaporation of volatile organic components. The
second relatively large weight loss (29.4%) could be ascribed to the
burnout of inorganic carbon and decomposition of most of the organic
groups, which contained PVP, CH3COO–,
and partially polymerized EG in the carbon nanospheres@MG hybrid.
The third stage of weight loss (13.7%) is present during the formation
of an intermediate product and the decomposition of residual organics.

analysis (TGA) curve of the H-NCM nanospheres
under air flow with a temperature ramp of 20 °C min–1.

The structural evolution mechanism
of the hollow structure during
the thermal disintegration can be explained as the heterogeneous contraction
caused by the nonequilibrium heating process. Of particular note is
a large contraction force (donated as Fc) that is induced by the oxidative degradation of the carbon nanospheres,
combined with an opposite adhesive force (donated as Fa) produced during the formation of metal oxide nanocrystallites
cooperatively that drives the separation between metal oxide nanocrystallite
shell and shrinkage of carbon nanosphere templates, thus resulting
in the formation of a hollow architecture. In the presintering process,
controlling the slow heating rate is found to be vital for maintaining
the uniformity of the formed hollow nanoscaled precursors: an overly
high ramping rate of 5 °C min–1 would lead
to collapse of the hollow structure. Therefore, the well-defined H-NCM
precursors are acquired after annealing at 550 °C for 4 h with
a precise control of heating rate of 1 °C min–1. Last, the precursors were calcined at 850 °C for 8 h in air
and resulted in the formation of H-NCM nanospheres.

Further
elucidation of the H-NCM formation process was performed
through more in-depth observation and characterization to support
our crafted route. A TEM panoramic view of the pristine carbon nanospheres
showed high uniformity with a diameter of approximately 100 nm (Figure 3A). As can be inspected
from Figure 3B, a MG
layer can be uniformly grown on the surface of carbon nanospheres
to produce a carbon nanosphere@MG hybrid structure after refluxing
in the metal acetate PVP–EG solution at an elevated temperature
(170 °C). The average diameters of about 110 nm of the resultant
H-NCM precursors are slightly larger than those of the carbon nanosphere
templates. After being pretreated at 550 °C for 4 h in air, the
resultant H-NCM precursors have diameters of about 80 nm (Figure 3C). Compared with
the carbon nanospheres@MG hybrid structure, the diameters of these
precursors are reduced, which is caused by overall shrinkage during
annealing. Estimations from the enlarged TEM image (Figure 3D) reveal that the shells of
the hollow nanospheres are made up of numerous nanocrystals. There
are two prerequisites for the formation of a hollow structure: (1)
a deep penetration of metal ions within the carbon nanosphere templates
and (2) the two rates of precursor shell formation and of carbon nanosphere
decomposition must match with each other. When the heating temperature
is low, the disintegration rate of the carbon species is slow, allowing
the metal atoms to gather within the carbon templates and interconnect
to form shell layers. Figure 3E reveals that each highly porous hollow nanosphere is made
of interconnected nanocrystallites and that the hollow morphology
is well-preserved after calcination at 850 °C for another 8 h.
As shown in Figure 3F, the nanosphere diameter, shell thickness, and nanocrystallite
size are estimated to be 50, 10, and 5 nm, respectively. A representative
HRTEM image (Figure 3G) taken from H-NCM shows the same interplanar distance to be 2.459
Å, which matches well with the (010) and (100) planes. The interlayer
spacing of 1.431 Å can be identified as (110) planes, corresponding
to the layered structure of NCM in the SAED pattern.30 The SAED pattern in Figure 3H proves that these nanocrystallites are of hexagonal
symmetry, which is consistent with the hexagonal structure of NCM.31 We further detect the elemental mapping via
EDX spectroscopy, which is shown in Figure 3I. It is noted that the distribution of Co,
Mn, Ni, and O elements is uniform within the hollow structure and
that no elements in the middle area originate from the hollow interiors.
The precise elemental analysis can be checked as Li1.002Mn0.338Ni0.327Co0.335O2 by inductively coupled plasma investigations, which maintains good
consistency with the expected ratio of 1.00:0.334:0.333:0.333 for
Li/Mn/Ni/Co.

XRD in Figure 4 demonstrates
the crystallographic structures of H-NCM and B-NCM nanocomposites.
No significant crystallographic difference in the XRD patterns is
observed between H-NCM and B-NCM. All peaks can be easily indexed
to the hexagonal α-NaFeO2 phase with a space group
of R3̅m (JCPDS 82-1495), indicating
that there is no impure phase. The peaks of (006)/(102) and (108)/(110)
have a good splitting, manifesting that the as-formed NCM materials
have a well-ordered layered structure. The ratios of the intensities
for (003) and (104) peaks are found to be 1.74 and 1.61 for H-NCM
and B-NCM, respectively, which are greater than 1.2, implying no evident
cation mixing.

nanospheres
and bulk NCM (B-NCM).

The electrochemical measurements of the H-NCM and B-NCM cathodes
were evaluated by both cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge
tests. Figure 5A demonstrates
the CV curves of H-NCM and B-NCM cathodes for the first cycle within
the voltage range of 2.5–4.5 V vs Li+/Li at a scan
rate of 0.1 mV s–1. The anodic peak of the H-NCM
cathode occurs at 3.854 V and the cathodic peak at 3.64 V, whereas
the anodic peak of the B-NCM cathode occurs at 3.878 V and the cathodic
peak at 3.638 V. Thus, the potential intervals (ΔV) of the two samples are, respectively, 0.214 and 0.240 V. It is
well-known that the smaller the value of ΔV, the better the reversibility of Li+ insertion and extraction.
For the H-NCM cathode, the oxidation peak decreased from 3.854 V and
stabilized at 3.801 V with an increasing number of cycles. The different
area of the first CV curves originates from the different peak currents
(Ip) in the same scan rate and voltage
range. According to the Randles–Sevcik equation  where n is the number of
electrons per reaction species (it is 1 for Li+), A is the electrode area, DLi is the diffusion coefficient of Li+, CLi* is the
bulk concentration of Li+ in the electrode, and the scan
rate (v) is 0.1 mV s–1. DLi is proportional to Ip based on the above equation. It is worth noticing that the
H-NCM nanostructure and the average 5 nm size of the primary nanoparticles
as well as the approximately 10 nm permeable walls will provide a
short pathway, which largely shortens the diffusion path for Li+, thus enhancing the DLi of H-NCM.
Accordingly, the higher DLi, the larger Ip, and the larger area of the first CV curves
are acquired. The CV profiles from the second cycle show insignificant
changes in subsequent sweeps (Figure S1), suggesting outstanding reversibility and good cycle stability
of electrochemical reactions in the well-defined H-NCM electrode. Figure 5B shows the galvanostatic
charge–discharge curves of H-NCM nanospheres for the 1st, 2nd,
5th, and 50th cycles at 0.1 C (1 C = 278 mA g–1).
All of the charge and discharge profiles of H-NCM are similar to those
reported previously,7,18 indicating a similar underlying
electrochemical pathway and the stable electrode structures in the
voltage range between 2.5 and 4.5 V. The first discharge capacity
of 205.6 mA h g–1 is obtained with an irreversible
capacity loss of 20.1%, which corresponds to an initial Coulombic
efficiency of 79.9% (Figure 5C). The capacity decay may be ascribed to the generation of
a solid electrolyte interlayer (SEI) and the partial deintercalation
of Li+ from the electrode material. The discharge capacities
of the 2nd, 5th, and 50th cycles are 203.7, 201.8, and 188.5 mA h
g–1, respectively. Compared with the first discharge
capacity, there is only about 8.5% capacity decay after 50 cycles.
The comparison cycling performances and Coulombic efficiencies of
H-NCM and B-NCM at 0.1 C are depicted in Figure 5C. The initial discharge capacity and cycling
stability of H-NCM are better than that of the B-NCM electrode. Impressively,
the capacity retention ratios for the two electrodes are 89.5 and
77.1% after 100 cycles, respectively. Their Coulombic efficiencies
immediately resume around 98.1 and 95.5% for the 2nd cycle and maintain
a value above 99% after a few charge–discharge cycles. More
importantly, the H-NCM electrode can be cycled with excellent stability
in high rates of 1 C and 10 C (Figure 5D). By contrast, severe capacity degradation was observed
to have occurred within the B-NCM cathode after 100 charge–discharge
cycles at 1 C and 10 C. In addition, the H-NCM composite manifests
excellent 2000 continuous cycles with the initial capacity preservation
of 60.1% at 10 C (Figure S2). Furthermore,
a corresponding postmortem morphological analysis elucidated that
hollow nanosphere architectures could be preserved after 2000 cycles,
although certain hollow nanospheres were cracked and deformed (Figure S3). These demonstrate that such a distinctive
hollow nanoarchitecture for the spheres affords good cycling stability.

and (F) electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) profiles and

cycles at frequencies ranging from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz.

Considering the significance of the rate capability
for practical
applications, initial charge and discharge curves from 0.1 to 5 C
in the potential window of 2.5–4.5 V (Figure S4) for the H-NCM cathode were measured. The H-NCM sample shows
high reversible specific capacities of 205.6, 194.9, 177.8, 165.9,
151.7, and 126.0 mA h g–1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2,
and 5 C, respectively. Conversely, the discharge capacities of B-NCM
are virtually all much weaker than those of H-NCM at any rate (Figure 5E). Besides, after
the high rate of 5 C cycling, a discharge capacity near its primal
value of 199.8 mA h g–1 can be restored when the
rate is resumed to 0.1 C; however, the B-NCM cathode only recovers
to 146.3 mA h g–1. It is worth noting that the H-NCM
cathode have a remarkable capacity, reversibility, and rate capability.

As is known to all, EIS has been measured to investigate the electrode
kinetics, which was performed on the discharged status of H-NCM and
B-NCM electrodes after five galvanostatic charge–discharge
cycles at frequencies ranging from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz (Figure 5F). The semicircle can be assigned
to the combination of the SEI resistance and the charge-transfer resistance
(Rct) at the interface between the electrolyte
and the electrode, specifically, the cell impedance is mainly ascribed
to Rct. From the simulated equivalent
circuit (in the inset of Figure 5F), the Rct of H-NCM is
calculated to be 60 ± 3 Ω, whereas that of B-NCM is 195
± 5 Ω. This measurement suggests that this distinctive
interior void space of LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 hollow spherical nanostructure can endow plentiful
contacts between the primary particles and the electrolyte, improve
charge transport, and decrease the kinetic impedance.

The augmented
cycling stability and rate performance of H-NCM nanospheres
could shed light on the following meritorious features. Impressively,
the structure is noteworthy: the microscopic structure with the hollow
cavity favors rapid electrolyte flooding and infiltration; the void
space in the interior could withstand the volume variation during
repeated lithiation and delithiation, which might contribute to the
excellent cycling stability. Moreover, the average 5 nm size of the
primary nanoparticles together with the approximately 10 nm permeable
walls will provide a short pathway, which largely shortens the diffusion
path for Li+. Meanwhile, the empty space is favorable for
serving as a reservoir for efficient penetration of the electrolyte
to boost active materials and the electrolyte contact interface, hence
leading to good rate capability.

Conclusions
To
summarize, we have designed and demonstrated H-NCM nanospheres
by using carbon nanospheres as hard templates and PVP as an additive.
The carbon nanosphere templates serve to not only form a cavity but
also effectively avoid particle aggregation during calcination. As
cathodes for LIBs, the H-NCM electrode manifests enhanced specific
capacities and rate performances with the discharge capacities of
205.6 mA h g–1 at 0.1 C and 113.6 mA h g–1 at 10 C between 2.5 and 4.5 V. Moreover, the as-synthesized H-NCM
cathode material also enables a superior cycling performance, especially,
long-term cycling stability has been demonstrated; the capacity retention
ratios are as high as 60.1% after 2000 continuous cycling at 10 C.
Collectively, the satisfactory discharge capacity, remarkable cyclic
stability, and desirable rate capability result from the synergism
between the small average size of nanocrystallites in a thin nanostructured
wall, which offer a short Li+ transport pathway, and the
sufficient void space, which buffers the volume expansion. This paper
presents the synthesis and characterization of hollow architectures
of multicomponent cathode materials in LIBs, which, given their desirable
features, may find wide practical utility.

Experimental Section
Materials
Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O (99%, AR,
Aladdin), Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O (99.5%,
AR, Aladdin), Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O (99%, AR, Aladdin), LiCH3COO·2H2O (99%,
AR, Aladdin), glucose (≥99.5%, GC, Aladdin), PVP (Mw ≈ 55 000, Sigma), and EG (HOC2H4OH, absolute for analysis) are obtained from
Shanghai LingFeng Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. All chemicals are directly
used without further purification. Deionized double-distilled water
is used for making all solutions.

Preparation of Carbon Nanospheres
In a typical synthesis,
carbon nanospheres were first obtained through emulsion–polymerization
of glucose under hydrothermal conditions. A 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless
steel autoclave contains 10.8 g of glucose and 60 mL of distilled
water, which was maintained at 180 °C for 8 h. The puce precipitation
was separated by filtration, alternately washed six times with distilled
water and ethanol, and dried at 80 °C in an oven.

Synthesis of
H-NCM Nanospheres
A total of 1.0 g of
PVP was dissolved in 100 mL of EG to form a clear solution with the
aid of ultrasonication. Afterward, an equivalent molar ratio of Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O, Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O, and Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O was added to the PVP–EG solution under
vigorous stirring. Subsequently, freshly prepared carbon nanosphere
powder (0.5 g) was dispersed into the above mixture solution via sonication
for 30 min. The resultant solution was transferred to a 250 mL three-necked
flask equipped with a condenser, kept at 120 °C for 12 h, and
allowed to heat to 170 °C for another 2 h to ensure sufficient
penetration of metal ions into the carbon nanospheres. The precipitation
was harvested by centrifugation and alternately washed with ethanol
and double-distilled water for seven times. The product was dried
at 80 °C overnight. The powder thus obtained was ground manually
with LiCH3COO·2H2O for 30 min, preheated
at the temperature of 550 °C for 4 h in air to form the hollow
precursors, and finally calcined at 850 °C for another 8 h with
a slow heating rate of 1 °C min–1 to yield
the H-NCM nanospheres.

To compare with the H-NCM cathode, nanoscaled
B-NCM was prepared by the similar coprecipitation strategy as that
previously reported.32 The B-NCM precursor
was sintered in air at 2 °C min–1 up to 850
°C for 8 h.

Characterization
The crystal structures
of the prepared
composites were carried out on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE DA VINCI X-ray
polycrystalline diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ,
1.5405 Å). A JEOL JEM-2100F bright-field TEM (200 kV accelerating
voltage) was used to identify the crystallite size, morphology, and
phase. TGA (TGA-209F3, NETZSCH, Germany) was recorded from 30 to 900
°C at a ramping rate of 20 °C min–1 under
a flow of air to investigate the material behavior during annealing.

Electrochemical Measurements
According to the literature
reported,33−35 the electrochemical measurements of the as-prepared
materials were tested using CR2025 coin-type half-cells with Li foil
serving as both counter and reference electrodes at room temperature.
The working electrode consists of 80 wt % as-synthesized active materials,
10 wt % conductive carbon black, and 10 wt % binder (polyvinylidene
fluoride). The mixture was dispersed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
to form a uniform slurry and was casted on an aluminum foil current
collector, followed by drying at 120 °C for 12 h in a vacuum
oven. Cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox with the concentrations
of moisture and oxygen below 0.1 ppm. Celgard 2400 films were used
as the separator, and a composition of 1 M LiPF6 in a 1:1
v/v mixture of ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate was used as the
electrolyte. The cell electrochemical performances were conducted
on a LAND CT2001A battery test system (Wuhan JINNUO Electronics, Ltd.,
China). CV and EIS were performed via a CHI760e electrochemical workstation
(Chenhua Instrument Co., Shanghai, China). EIS measurements were detected
in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz and an ac voltage with
5 mV amplitude.
