Currently, the production of alternative
fuels from renewable sources
such as biomass has been increased in order to meet energy policies
and reduce the environmental impacts of fossil fuels. This work is
focused on hydrogen production from oil palm empty fruit bunches using
different biomass gasification methods (direct gasification, indirect
gasification, and supercritical water gasification) and purification
technologies (selexol-based absorption and pressure swing adsorption).
Six routes were selected based on these technologies and simulated
using Aspen Plus software. Possible operating process improvements
were suggested based on parametric sensitivity analysis by studying
the effect of several variables on hydrogen production: gasification
temperature, gasifying agent-to-biomass ratio, steam-to-carbon monoxide
ratio, temperature of a high-temperature step reactor, and pressure
in a hydrogen purification unit. The methodology of waste reduction
algorithm was performed to assess the environmental impacts of each
route. Results showed that hydrogen production was improved by increasing
the gasification reaction temperature to 900 °C, oxygen-to-biomass
ratio to 1.5, and pressure of purification stage to 10 atm for all
routes. However, routes 1 and 2 presented a slight increase up to
0.7% in hydrogen yield using 1.5 mol O2/mol biomass. The
environmental assessment revealed that routes 3 and 4 exhibited the
lowest toxicological and atmospheric environmental impacts because
of the use of char generated in the gasification reaction for energy
production. These results indicated that route 4 exhibited the best
performance for producing hydrogen from an environmental viewpoint.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The fossil fuel depletion and emerging energy policies have led
the development of novel alternatives for clean energy sources that
face the global energy demand, which rose by 2.1% in 2017.1,2 Currently, hydrogen is recognized as a cleaner energy source because
of its zero-carbon emission.3 The advantage
of this fuel is assigned to its high energy density (143 MJ/kg) compared
with fuels such as gasoline and methane.4 Hydrogen also shows high energy efficiency, competing with other
alternative energy sources including wind, solar, and geothermal energy.5 It has a low cost of storage and transportation,
and the rapid development of production technology facilitates its
application.6 Many efforts have been made
for hydrogen production in a more affordable, reliable, and efficient
way with minimum environmental impacts.7 Technologies related to hydrogen production using renewable resources
are currently under study in laboratory and pilot plant scales in
order to improve technical efficiency and achieving sustainability
in energy supply.8 Residual biomass valorization
to produce hydrogen is the most appealing route because of its abundance
and cost-effectiveness.9 These biomaterials
are selected as a hydrogen feedstock according to their availability,
cost, carbohydrate content, and biodegradability.10 One of the main advantages of using residual biomass lies
in facing environmental and economic problems associated to the uncontrolled
discharging of municipal solid wastes.11

Residual biomass can be transformed into hydrogen using different
processes classified into biochemical and thermochemical.12 Gasification is recognized to be financially
viable, achieving a high hydrogen yield and offering high flexibility
in the use of different kinds of feedstock materials.13,14 Biomass gasification reaction can be performed using methods such
as direct, indirect, or supercritical water. Direct gasification is
an autothermal process in which the gasifying agent may be composed
of air or pure oxygen and the gasifier is internally heated through
partial combustion.15,16 Atnaw et al.17 studied the production of syngas from oil palm fronds using
autothermal gasification in order to evaluate the effect of the reactor
temperature on gas composition, calorific value, and gasification
efficiency. They obtained that an oxidation zone temperature above
850 °C is appropriate to produce a syngas with high concentration
of fuel components. On the other hand, the indirect gasification process
uses the unreacted char for producing heat that is transferred to
the gasifier.18 Mayerhofer et al.19 used an indirect or allothermal gasifier to
convert wood into syngas and varied the temperature (750–840
°C), steam-to-biomass (S/B) ratio (0.8–1.2), and pressure
(0.1–0.25 MPa) in order to analyze its effects on tar content
and gas composition, showing that an increase in temperature reduces
the total tar content. The gasification in supercritical water is
an emerging process for biomasses with high content of moisture, which
has reported to show high conversion rates despite of its dependency
with operation conditions, feedstock, and reactor design.20,21 Sivasangar et al.22 studied the production
of hydrogen-rich gas from empty fruit bunches via supercritical water
gasification and obtained improvements in hydrogen concentration with
reaction time and biomass-to-water ratio.

Several agroindustrial
residues have been employed for alternative
fuels production; among these, oil palm residual biomass seems to
be a promising source of renewable energy because of its high carbohydrate
content.23 African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) is a perennial crop widely employed
for vegetable oil production generating different residues (e.g.,
bagasse, shells, leaves, and empty fruit bunches) from plantation
and milling activities.24,25 To date, limited research
in the open literature exists to assess the scaling-up of biomass
conversion technologies in a complete topology for hydrogen production
based on technical and environmental aspects. These knowledge gaps
may be filled up by contributions focused on technical sensitivity
analysis and environmental evaluation of hydrogen production. For
the first time, a technical and environmental comparative study of
different routes for hydrogen production from oil palm residual biomass
is performed. To this end, three different gasification methods and
two purification technologies were selected for a six-route arrangement.
Such routes were evaluated from an environmental viewpoint using a
WAR (waste reduction) algorithm. A parametric sensitivity analysis
was also conducted to identify process variables most affecting process
performance.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Process Description
Biomass gasification
is a high-temperature-dependent process that converts biomass into
small quantities of char and ash and gaseous or liquid fuel with high
conversion rates.26 The overall reaction
for the gasification process is defined by reaction R1, where GH and LH refer to gaseous and liquid
hydrocarbons, respectively.27 R1  

The gaseous product
stream composition is mainly CO, H2, CO2, CH4, and H2O.28 Separation
of hydrogen from this gas is performed using technologies such as
pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and absorption with selexol. The production
of hydrogen from empty fruit bunches (EFBs) was performed via six
routes considering different technologies for biomass gasification
(direct gasification, indirect gasification, and supercritical water
gasification) and hydrogen purification (selexol absorption and pressure
swing adsorption), which were simulated using Aspen Plus software.

2.1.1 Hydrogen Production through Direct Gasification
Coupled with Pressure Swing Adsorption (Route 1) or Selexol Absorption
(Route 2)
Direct gasification technology uses air or pure
oxygen as a gasifying agent, and part of the fuel is employed to supply
the heat required for endothermic gasification reactions.15 A fluidized bed reactor was selected to conduct
the gasification of EFBs because of its feeding flexibility, good
mixing properties, high conversions, and scalability.29 The biomass gasification generates char that needs to be
separated from the product gas; hence, a cyclone was assembled to
retain such materials. The syngas is cooled and fed into a scrubber
with water for further treatment. Then, a water gas shift (WGS) process
is carried out in order to convert CO and water into CO2 and H2 using steam and can operate in two stages: high-temperature
step (HTS) at 320–360 °C and low-temperature step (LTS)
at 190–50 °C, enabling the production of an additional
amount of H2 and better steam management.30,31 A common exothermic reversible reaction during the WGS process is
given by reaction R2.32 R2  

The remaining
water
in the shifted syngas is removed, and the hydrogen is purified via
pressure swing adsorption or absorption with selexol. For route 1,
a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit is employed for gas purification
through an adsorption process onto the surface of porous materials
such as activate carbon, zeolites, among others.33 For route 2, gas separation is performed by bringing the
gas in contact with a liquid solvent such as selexol in a scrubber
column. This absorbent is a mixture of ether and poly(ethylene glycol)
dimethyl ether commonly commercialized by big chemical companies.34Figure 1 depicts the schematic representation of direct gasification
coupled with both hydrogen purification technologies.

Figure 1 Block diagram of hydrogen
production through route 1 or route 2.

2.1.2 Hydrogen Production through Indirect Gasification
Coupled with Pressure Swing Adsorption (Route 3) or Selexol Absorption
(Route 4)
The indirect biomass gasification consists of the
importation of heat from outside the gasifier reactor by combustion
of char as shown in Figure 2. This technology for biomass conversion is considered a second-generation
system in comparison to the direct gasification because it faces the
drawback of ashes and carbon accumulation inside the gasifier. The
gasification reactions take place into a fluidized bed gasifier. The
gasifier converts the EFBs into syngas at 870 °C and 1.6 bar.
The unreacted char is combusted in the combustor to generate heat,
which is transferred to the gasifier.18 Purification of hydrogen is performed via the PSA unit or selexol
absorption for route 3 or 4, respectively.

Figure 2 Block diagram of hydrogen
production through route 3 or route 4.

2.1.3 Hydrogen Production through Supercritical
Water Gasification Coupled with Pressure Swing Adsorption (Route 5)
or Selexol Absorption (Route 6)
The water properties at supercritical
conditions (374 °C and 220 bar) are characterized for a reduction
in dielectric constant and thermal conductivity. Owing to its physicochemical
properties, supercritical water is an acceptable reaction medium for
biomass conversion.35 According to Calzavara
et al.,36 a lower amount of char is generated
in comparison to other conventional gasification technologies. As
can be observed from Figure 3, the hydrogen production is increased by steam reforming
of hydrocarbons in the syngas stream as methane. The overall reaction
for the methane steam reforming process is described by reaction R3, which occurs at temperatures
between 650 and 850 °C.30 R3  

Figure 3 Block
diagram of hydrogen production through route 5 or route 6.

The type of purification technology also provides two topologies:
the first one is the PSA unit (route 5), and the second one is the
absorption with selexol (route 6).

2.2 Parametric
Sensitivity Analysis
A
parametric sensitivity analysis allows identifying the relationships
between input variables and resulting outputs, which is useful for
determining suitable operating conditions.37 The information provided by this analysis can be characterized quantitatively,
such as with a sensitivity metric or empirical derivative, or graphically.38 In this work, different input variables (gasification
temperature, gasifying agent-to-biomass ratio, steam-to-carbon monoxide
ratio, temperature of an HTS reactor, and pressure in a hydrogen purification
unit) were varied in order to evaluate its effects on the selected
output variables (hydrogen production yield, hydrogen production,
biomass conversion, and char production). To this end, operating conditions
entered to the simulation were updated based on the parameters of
sensitivity analysis. After running the simulation, mass flowrates
of relevant streams such as hydrogen, char, and CO were compiled in
an Excel spreadsheet. Finally, plots of output variables versus sensitivity
parameters or input variables were built.

2.3 Environmental
Analysis
The six routes
for hydrogen production from empty fruit bunches were evaluated from
an environmental viewpoint using the waste reduction algorithm. The
potential environmental impacts (PEI) include several categories of
impacts that are classified into atmospheric and toxicological.39 The total output rate of PEI is defined by eq 1, where iout(cp), iout(ep), iwe(ep), and iwe(cp) are the rate of PEI leaving the system
due to chemical interactions, the rate of PEI out of the system due
to energy generation processes, and the rate of PEI out of the system
as a result of the release of waste energy due to energy generation
and chemical processes, respectively.40 1  

The PEI generation
rate is represented by eq 2, indicating the total potential environmental impacts generated
within the system. 2  

These output and generation PEI were
also normalized to the production
rate by eqs 3 and 4. 3   4  

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Process Simulation
The simulation
schemes for hydrogen production from EFBs via six different routes
involve process equipment and streams of raw material, products, and
byproducts. The feedstock derived from palm oil industry is represented
by EFB stream. The solid wastes are composed of ashes and char formed
during gasification reactions, which are labeled as ASH stream. The
stream properties were estimated by nonrandom two liquid (NRTL) and
UNIFAC thermodynamic models. The chemical properties of hydrogen provided
by Aspen Plus software were compared to those reported by Emsley et
al.41 and are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1 Chemical

The main process stages are pointed out as follows:
gasification
(green frame), WGS (orange frame), PSA (blue frame), and selexol absorption
(gray frame). Operating conditions of process streams for routes 1–6
are summarized in the Appendix section. Figure 4 shows the hydrogen
production from EFBs using route 1, which consist of gasifiers (GASF1
and GASF2), water gas shift reactors (HTS and LTS), a scrubber (CLEANER),
and a pressure swing adsorption unit (PSA). The oil palm biomass (EFB)
was milled and dried before feeding into the gasifiers in order to
reduce its particle size and remove excess water. In addition, the
water gas shift reactors were operated in an equilibrium model. As
shown in Figure 5,
the gaseous product stream (S6) is sent to a cyclone (SEP), in which
ashes are removed and the gaseous stream is fed into the scrubber
(CLEANER). Then, the syngas reacts with steam inside the SWG reactors
(HTS and LTS) producing a H2-rich stream that is purified
in the absorption column after removing excess water (SEP3). A desorption
step after hydrogen purification was required in order to separate
carbon dioxide from the selexol stream. Hence, the rich solvent is
heated and fed into a regeneration column (SEP2), which produces separate
streams with CO2 and the solvent that is sent back to the
column.33 The solvent stream is labeled
as S5, while reboiler for desorption is represented as E6.

Figure 6 shows the
simulation flowsheet of the hydrogen production process through route
3, in which steam (STEAM1) is sent to the gasifier (GASF2) for gasification
endothermic reaction. The unreacted char (S7) passes through the combustor
(COMBST) to be oxidized with air (AIR), and the combustion heat is
sent back to the gasifier. Figure 7 shows a similar simulation for route 4; however, the
purification technology is selexol absorption instead of PSA.

Figure 6 Simulation
flowsheet for route 3.

Figure 7 Simulation flowsheet
for route 4.

As shown in Figure 8, supercritical steam gasification does not
require a drying stage;
hence, the biomass (EFB) is directly fed into a mill (MILL) to reduce
its particle size because the gas yield increases when feedstock particle
size decreases.27 The milled stream (S1)
is sent to heat exchangers (E1 and E1-1) for heating until reaching
the inlet temperature of the gasifier. This route uses PSA technology
and two streams leaving from the adsorption column (HYDROGEN and SUBP).
The simulation flowsheet of hydrogen production via supercritical
water gasification and purification with selexol absorption is shown
in Figure 9. The steam
leaving the scrubber (SEP1) is fed into a steam reformer (REF) to
convert methane from the syngas stream into hydrogen and carbon monoxide
by reacting with steam.

3.2 Parametric Sensitivity Analysis
3.2.1 Gasification Process
3.2.1.1 Effect of Gasification
Reaction Temperature
The temperature is recognized as one
of the most significant operating
parameters on the biomass conversion throughout gasification reactions.42 For fluidized bed gasifiers, the limited range
of temperature is between 550 and 900 °C due to the presence
of high volatile matter content in biomasses.43Figure 10 shows
the hydrogen production under three different reaction temperatures
during the gasification process (500, 700, and 900 °C). As can
be observed, the highest hydrogen production was achieved using supercritical
water gasification and purification with PSA technology (route 5)
due to the selectivity toward hydrogen production under suitable operating
conditions of gasification temperature and pressure.22 It was found that an increment in hydrogen production as
temperature increased because of the thermal cracking of molecular
hydrogen on a compound structure.44 Similar
results were reported by Mohammed et al.,27 who studied the gasification of empty fruit bunches using a fluidized
bed reactor at a temperature range of 700–100 °C and obtained
an increase in hydrogen yield from 10.8 to 38.2%.

Figure 10 Effect of gasification
reaction temperature on hydrogen production.

The biomass gasification techniques also limit the hydrogen yield;
hence, gasification temperature was varied between 500 and 1100 °C
using direct, indirect, and supercritical water gasification. As shown
in Figure 11, the
supercritical water gasification exhibited the highest biomass conversion
as temperature increased. Lachos-Perez et al.21 pointed out that biomass in a supercritical environment favors the
rapid fractionation of hemicellulose and cellulose due to the properties
of water at a high temperature and pressure. Sivasangar et al.22 obtained conversions around 50% of EFBs into
hydrogen using a supercritical water reactor at 240 bar.

Figure 11 Effect of
temperature and gasification technique on biomass conversion.

Figure 12 shows
the influence of temperature on char formation after the gasification
reaction using the selected biomass gasification methods at 10 atm.
As can be observed, supercritical water gasification (SWG) reported
the lowest mass flowrate of char, which was expected according to
the information found in the literature related to the advantages
of this technique. Changsuwan et al.45 reported
that supercritical water gasification can reach high gasification
efficiency because of the reduction of char formation and the improvement
of selectivity for H2.

Figure 12 Effect of gasification reaction temperature
on char production.

3.2.1.2 Effect
of Gasifying Agent-to-Biomass Ratio
The gasifying agent plays
an important role in the syngas generation
process because it affects the gas quality, hydrogen content, and
heating value.46 Different gasifying agents
have been employed for biomass gasification such as air, oxygen, and
steam. The gasifying agent-to-biomass ratio was varied in 10, 30,
and 50% in order to evaluate its influence on hydrogen generation.
As shown in Figure 13, supercritical water achieved the highest hydrogen yield because
of the changes in ionic product, polarity, and electrical conductivity
of water at a high pressure and temperature.21 Steam also reported better results compared to air, which is attributed
to the absence of nitrogen leading to a shift in chemical equilibrium
of the gasification reaction.47 In addition,
it was found that hydrogen production was not enhanced by increasing
the oxygen-to-biomass ratio in the direct gasification process. Ogu
et al.26 reported an increase in biomass
conversion while the gasifying agent (steam) amount increased for
indirect gasification. Sivasangar et al.22 also pointed out an enhancement in hydrogen production from oil
palm wastes as the supercritical water-to-biomass ratio increased.

Figure 13 Effect
of gasifying agent-to-biomass ratio on hydrogen production.

3.2.2 Water Gas Shift Process
3.2.2.1 Effect of Steam-to-Carbon Monoxide Ratio
Steam amount
in water gas shift reactions constitutes a relevant
parameter for hydrogen production because side reactions may occur
when the steam-to-CO ratio is low, generating undesirable products
such as carbon and methane.48 The conversion
of CO into CO2 and H2 by reacting with water
and hydrogen generation were considered as output variables. As can
be observed from Figure 14, the variation of this ratio from 0.5 to 2.5 mol H2O/mol CO caused an increase in both output variables, enhancing hydrogen
formation in the WGS reaction. Similar results were obtained by Lang
et al.,49 who reported that hydrogen production
increased from 21 to 34% while varying the steam-to-CO ratio between
1.45 and 2.0 in a water gas shift reactor in the presence of a catalyst.

Figure 14 Effect
of steam-to-carbon monoxide ratio on CO conversion and H2 generation.

3.2.2.2 Effect
of WGS Reaction Temperature
The temperature is a key parameter
for water gas shift reaction performance.
Such parameter was varied between 195 and 495 °C in the high-temperature
water gas shift reactor in order to analyze its influence on carbon
monoxide conversion. The reaction pressure and steam-to-carbon monoxide
ratio were fixed at 1 atm and 1.5 mol H2O/mol CO, respectively. Figure 15 shows the performance
of carbon monoxide conversion and hydrogen formation as the WGS reaction
temperature increased. It is well known that the second stage of the
water gas shift process (high temperature) gives a high reaction rate
but a low conversion.50 Hence, the decrease
in hydrogen formation was expected.

Figure 15 Effect of WGS reaction temperature on
CO conversion and H2 generation.

3.2.3 Hydrogen Purification Process
3.2.3.1 Effect of Pressure
Figure 16 shows the influence
of operating pressure on hydrogen purification using PSA technology.
The pressure was varied between 1 and 10 atm, and the temperature
was fixed at 40 °C. The hydrogen purity exhibited slight differences
for routes 1, 3, and 5, attributed to the inlet concentration of stream
in adsorption columns. Yang et al.51 studied
the hydrogen purification using a PSA unit under different operating
conditions and found that the highest purity (96–99%) was achieved
at 6–10 atm, similar to the results reported in this work.

Figure 16 Effect
of pressure on hydrogen purity using PSA technology.

This parametric sensitivity analysis in the hydrogen purification
process was also performed considering the selexol absorption technology.
As can be observed from Figure 17, the highest carbon dioxide uptake was achieved in
a pressure range of 50–60 bar. Marroig52 performed an analysis of natural gas purification using selexol
and obtained a reduction in CO2 concentration from 80 to
5 ppm, which indicated that solvents are efficient for removing undesirable
gases.

Figure 17 Effect of pressure on hydrogen purity using selexol absorption
technology.

Table 2 summarizes
an analysis of process improvements derived from simulation results
during the parametric sensitivity study by varying specific operating
conditions such as the gasification reaction temperature, oxygen-to-biomass
ratio, steam-to-carbon monoxide ratio, WGS reaction temperature, and
pressure of purification columns.

3.3 Computer-Aided Environmental Evaluation
3.3.1 Total Output and Generation of Potential
Environmental Impacts
The PEI output index for each of the
routes is shown in Figure 18. Natural gas was selected as the fuel for suppling energy
requirements in the hydrogen production process. As can be observed,
the routes that exhibited the highest PEI output and generation were
routes 1 and 2, attributed to the huge amount of char generated in
direct gasification compared to other gasification methods. Environmental
impacts of char or carbon corresponds to breathing diseases such as
lung cancer.53 The PEI values are positive
for each gasification process due to the use of environmentally friendly
feedstocks. Susmozas et al.54 reported
that the impacts of biomass gasification are higher than the gas reforming
process.

Figure 18 Potential environmental impacts output and generation rates per
kilogram of hydrogen produced in each route evaluated.

Figure 19 depicts
global results per PEI/kg and PEI/h in order to study the influence
of product mass flowrate on environmental performance. Routes 5 and
6 also reported high PEI values, suggesting that supercritical water
gasification increases the environmental impacts of hydrogen production
because of the energy consumption to achieve supercritical conditions.
Routes 3 and 4 presented the lowest PEI because of the use of char
for generating energy, which reduces the requirements of utilities.

Figure 19 Comparison
of global potential environmental impacts per units
of time and units of product rate for each route evaluated.

The PEI categories considered by the WAR algorithm
are divided
into two groups: toxicological and atmospheric impacts. The toxicological
categories are as follows: human toxicity potential by ingestion (HTPI),
human toxicity potential by exposure (HTPE), aquatic toxicity potential
(ATP), and terrestrial toxicity potential (TTP). The atmospheric categories
are as follows: global warming potential (GWP), ozone depletion potential
(ODP), smog formation potential (PCOP), and acidification potential
(AP).55Figure 20 shows the toxicological impacts for each
route. The HTPI category exhibited the highest PEI value, which is
attributed to the char generated in gasification reactions. Routes
3 and 4 showed the lowest toxicological impacts due to the use of
the waste of gasification to generate energy.

Figure 24 Effect of energy source on total PEI per kilogram of hydrogen

for each route evaluated.

The effect of energy consumption for each biomass gasification
route on toxicological environmental impacts is shown in Figure 21. As can be observed,
the PEI values increased as energy consumption increased. Hence, it
was expected that route 6 presented the highest environmental impacts.

The atmospheric potential environmental impacts are shown in Figure 22, which allows
identifying the categories that most contribute to each route. The
acidification potential exhibited the highest PEI values because of
the presence of sulfur on fossil fuels used for satisfying energy
requirements. Route 3 presented the lowest atmospheric impacts because
of the low energy consumption and the alternative use of char.

Figure 23 shows
the output and generation PEI index for each atmospheric category
using the six routes for hydrogen production. Route 2 reported a high
output and generation PEI value for the acidification potential followed
by route 1, which is attributed to the high consumption of fuels for
biomass gasification.

3.3.2 Effect of Energy Source
Different
fossil fuels were employed to analyze its influence on the potential
environmental impacts. As shown in Figure 24, the highest PEI values were reached using
carbon. Similar results were reported by Herrera-Aristizábal,39 obtaining an increase in environmental impacts
using carbon instead of oil and gas.

4 Conclusions
This work attempted to evaluate the hydrogen production from oil
palm residual biomass via six routes based on different gasification
methods and product purification technologies. The parametric sensitivity
analysis allowed identifying operating modifications in order to improve
hydrogen production. An increase in the gasification reaction temperature
from 700 to 900 °C enhanced the hydrogen production up to 27%.
The steam-to-carbon monoxide ratio also played a key role in CO conversion.
The water gas shift reaction temperature was increased from 295 to
395 °C, affecting the hydrogen production from 51 to 48%. In
addition, routes 3 and 4 exhibited the lowest potential environmental
impacts due to the combustion of char for providing heat from outside
the gasifier reactor. The PEI associated to energy consumption corresponded
to routes 5 and 6, attributed to the energy requirements to achieve
supercritical conditions. Route 4 was selected as the most suitable
from an environmental viewpoint because of the low environmental impact’s
generation.
