The
effect of thermal treatment on the structure and electrical/optical
properties of vapor phase-polymerized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):tosylate
(PEDOT:Tos) and polypyrrole:tosylate (PPy:Tos) polymer films was investigated.
Thermal treatment was applied postpolymerization but prior to washing
the embedded oxidant layer out of the polymer film. Structural and
chemical changes arising from the treatment were studied in the context
of their conductive and electrochromic behavior. Spectroscopic analysis
indicated a rise in the doping levels of both conductive polymers
when exposed to thermal treatment. Additionally, an increase in the
film thickness was recorded after the oxidant and other unbound species
were removed from the polymer layer using an ethanol rinse. As such,
a strong indication that polymerization continued even in the absence
of (external) monomer vapor was present. This film thickness increase
was most pronounced for PPy:Tos but also present in the PEDOT:Tos
film. Heat-treated films exhibited enhanced cohesion, making them
more robust and therefore increasing the viability for the material
to be used in the optoelectronics area. This robustness, due to additional
(cross-linking) oligomer growth, came at the expense of lower conductivity
relative to their untreated counterparts.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Conductive
polymers have been of great interest to researchers
and industry alike because of their conductive and optical properties
which can be altered by changing the dopant species and doping level,
conjugation length, and the incorporation of additives.1 Various means of improving these materials have
been keenly investigated, ranging from conductivity to optical and
stability enhancement.2,3 Of the many conductive polymers
which exist, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and polypyrrole
(PPy) are arguably the two most studied. This gives them the potential
of being exploited because of their favorable electrochromic behaviors.4 Thus, these polymers have been used in a variety
of applications such as adaptive camouflage5 and other optoelectronic devices.6 For
instance, because PEDOT is a p-type material it has been utilized
as a hole injection layer in anodes for organic light-emitting diodes.7−9 Because these polymers are also optically active they have been
utilized in so-called “smart windows” for automotive
and building applications.10 These windows
modulate the transmitted or reflected solar radiation and have the
potential to reduce the demand for lighting and heating and hence
energy consumption.11

PPy and PEDOT
have traditionally been synthesized via chemical
oxidation or electrochemical polymerization methods. Both these methods
rely on a solvent carrier to suspend the monomer and, in simple terms,
can be thought of as a “wet” process.10 Vapor phase polymerization (VPP), however, does not utilize
a solvent carrier but rather the monomer is transported to an oxidant
layer in vapor form. This process has been described as a solvent-less
or “dry” process12 and was
first utilized in the pioneering work by Mohammadi et al.13 VPP overcomes problems associated with performance
and processability, as polymerization occurs in situ negating any
polymer insolubility issues.14 The procedure
involves coating a substrate with an oxidant layer, usually an iron(III)
salt (with or without other additives), which acts as both the polymerization
and subsequently the doping agent for the forming polymer once it
is brought into contact with the monomer vapor. The polymerization
is initiated at the liquid–vapor interface as the monomer condenses
on the substrate surface.15,16 Excess oxidant, unreacted
monomer, and any by-products are then removed from the film by rinsing
the polymer with an ethanol spray (or bath) to create the thin film
conductive polymer.

The VPP process consistently produces conductive
polymers exhibiting
the highest conductivity values as exemplified by Cho et al.,17 who produced PEDOT nanowires with a conductivity
exceeding 7500 S cm–1. Other recent works on VPP
PEDOT and PPy have demonstrated how additives, such as copolymers
incorporated into the oxidant solution, have the ability to modify
the conductivity and robustness of these polymers.18−20 Such work has
been particularly important for PPy, where redox reactions are sensitive
to the presence of oxygen, and a decay in electrical conductivity
occurs due to the irreversible degradation of the polymer backbone.21 This loss in performance was investigated by
Brooke et al.,22 who noted an increased
resistance to degradation under oxidative and reductive conditions
when the triblock copolymer poly(ethylene glycol)–poly(propylene
glycol)–poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG–PPG–PEG) was
incorporated into the oxidant solution.

Most oxidant solutions
utilized in the VPP process consist of one
(or more) solvent carriers (i.e., alcohols or water), additives (i.e.,
pyridine, glycol, etc.), and an oxidant, with the most common being
iron(III) tosylate. Other alternatives exist and include (but are
not limited to) iron(III) trimethylbenzenesulfonate and iron(III)
chloride.16 Typically oxidant selection
is based upon factors such as effective oxidative strength and the
desire to incorporate a particular anion into the forming polymer.23,24 Iron(III) tosylate is generally preferred due to its low effective
oxidation strength which produces a slow rate of polymer formation.25−27 This trait, supposedly, produces long polymer chains with extended
and uninterrupted conjugation along the polymer backbone oxidant,
leading to improved charge transportation due to structural or chemical
defects.28

Although many studies
on VPP PPy and PEDOT have been done in which
aspects of the oxidant have been meticulously altered and examined
or process variables such as temperature, pressure, humidity, and
so on changed,16,29,30 there have been no systematic studies regarding the postpolymerization
heat treatment of these materials. This technique involves subjecting
the polymer to an elevated temperature for a fixed time interval after
removing the polymer/oxidant/substrate from the polymerization chamber
but prior to rinsing and removing any unreacted material from the
polymer film. This study examines the changes which occur in the VPP
conductive polymers when subjected to a heat treatment protocol postpolymerization.
The expectation being that the process will yield continued polymerization
due to embedded (initially unreacted) monomer within the film which
differs from the normal process. The intention of this study is to
yield a greater understanding of the mechanisms behind the anticipated
changes.

2 Results and Discussion
For the practical
application of conductive polymer films synthesized
using VPP, one needs a robust polymer film. Some polymers such as
PEDOT exhibit sufficient flexibility while retaining film cohesion.
Others, however, such as PPy can suffer cohesion issues, with films
often disintegrating during the ethanol rinse process. This problem
is less pronounced when “stronger” oxidants (having
high effective oxidative strength) such as FeCl3 are used
in the polymerization process instead of “softer” oxidants
such as iron(III) tosylate.6 The drawback,
however, is that polymers synthesized with FeCl3 typically
exhibit lower conductivity levels, and in electrochromic applications,
the presence of (residual) oxidant has been reported to etch the indium
tin oxide (ITO) transparent electrode.6

A possible solution for polymers exhibiting low cohesive strength
could be to induce higher molecular weight growth by increasing the
polymerization time. However, this has been shown to have detrimental
effects on some conductive polymers.19 With
this in mind, an alternative process is presented herein, in which
the PEDOT and PPy samples were transferred from the VPP chamber to
an oven set to 70 °C for various amounts of time, before ethanol
rinsing any excess or unreacted oxidant from the sample. It was hypothesized
that the elevated temperature(s) may allow for a degree of polymerization/cross-linking
to occur, utilizing the short chain oligomers and residual monomer
residing within the oxidant layer after removing the samples from
the VPP chamber. Initial tests showed noticeable improvements in the
cohesion of polymerized films when postpolymerization heat treatment
was applied. A prior work has revealed that PEDOT is sufficiently
robust when polymerized with iron(III) tosylate.31 Notwithstanding this, an improvement was observed when
the film was deposited as a free-standing membrane onto a perforated
plate (see Figure 1a3,b3). The non-heat-treated sample fractured
as the film dried while the heat-treated PEDOT:Tos remained intact.
The PPy:Tos heat-treated for 7 h postpolymerization displayed vastly
improved integrity compared to those rinsed directly after polymerization
as shown in Figure 1. As a consequence of the heat treatment, a distinct color change
was observed for the PPy:Tos sample (not observed for PEDOT:Tos).
To examine the cause of the color change, the polymers were studied
by UV–vis–near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy.

UV–vis–NIR spectroscopy
is frequently used to analyze
electron transitions and the band gap structure in semiconductors
and conductive polymers. Typically, two major absorption bands can
be observed in the spectra of conductive polymers in the 300–2000
nm range.32 The broad band found in the
NIR region (i.e. >800 nm) refers to polaron and bipolaron transitions,
while the peak in the visible region (i.e. 380–800 nm) typically
refers to the band gap transition. In optical spectra of PEDOT:Tos,
the peak energy gap is typically observed at approximately 600 nm,
with single polaron transitions at 750–850 nm, followed by
a broad absorption bipolaron band starting at approximately 1150 nm
and extending to the medium wavelength IR region.32 Depending on the oxidation state of the conductive polymers,
the energy gap (Eg) peak is more pronounced
in the reduced state while the polaron and bipolaron excitations are
more pronounced in the oxidized state. Given that PEDOT:Tos is naturally
highly oxidized when synthesized using the VPP process, the Eg peak in the UV–vis–NIR spectra
(see Figure 2b) only
manifests itself as a shoulder on the low wavelength slope of the
polaron excitation, making it problematic if not impossible to determine
its exact position. This peak was observed to be marginally lower
in the intensity in spectra of PEDOT:Tos postpolymerization heat-treated
for longer times. Typically, this could be an indication of a more
oxidized polymer,32 and this hypothesis
is explored further in the manuscript.

heat-treated samples. (a) PPy and (b) PEDOT samples. Note: black—0
h (not treated); blue = 2.5 h; red = 5 h; green = 7 h. The arrows
indicate the position of the energy gap peak (in PEDOT not observed
clearly due to polymers being in the oxidized state, in PPy partly
obstructed by the absorption from the substrate), and in PPy:Tos,
the additional sharp absorption peak in the visible region is related
to electron transition from valence band (VB) to antibonding polaron
state.

The energy gap for PPy is usually
located in the range 3.2–3.6
eV (344–387 nm), and the polymer presents additional features
in the visible range due to interband transitions at 0.7–1.0
eV: 1240–1770 nm, 1.4 eV: 885 nm, and 2.1–2.7 eV: 460–590
nm.33 Although the band gap structure changes
in a similar way upon doping, as for other conductive polymers, the
absorption peak at 2.1–2.7 eV (460–590 nm) relating
to the transition from the VB to the antibonding polaron state becomes
the dominant feature in the visible range.33 With increased doping/higher oxidation levels, absorption at 2.1–2.7
eV (460–590 nm) increases, making the polymer appear visibly
darker. The PPy:Tos samples analyzed in this study displayed increased
absorption in the 2.61–2.7 eV (460–475 nm) region as
heat treatment times were increased. The absorption peak maximum was
found to shift toward higher wavelength, and the calculated value
of the respective energy level of the antibonding polaron state (see Table S2) also decreased (from 2.09 eV for nontreated
to 1.98 eV for the sample heat-treated for 7 h). Additionally, in
the sample treated for 7 h, the second absorption edge was found on
the low energy side of the interband absorption peak which corresponds
to an interband transition value of 2.15 eV, suggesting the presence
of a second phase in the heat-treated PPy:Tos (see the Supporting Information for the Tauc plots and
fittings). This is hypothesized to be related to a defected polymer
formed upon prolonged heat treatment. The energy gap calculated from
the spectra changed from 3.40 eV for the nontreated sample to 3.18
eV for the sample posttreated for 7 h (see the inset in Figure 2a). These observations are
likely to be related to changes in the chemistry of the polymer, and
to explore it further, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis
was performed.

The XPS spectra of PEDOT:Tos and PPy:Tos samples
were analyzed
for atomic percentage and the fine structure of the peaks examined
for specific elements. This analysis was performed to understand changes
in the polymers chemistry induced by heat treatment. In PEDOT:Tos
samples, no significant changes were observed in relative atomic concentrations
apart from subtle variations in the concentration of carbon (see Figure S4). Because in the PEDOT:Tos system,
both the polymer and dopant share the same elements, fine scans of
S 2p peaks were analyzed as per the methodology used by Bubnova et
al.32 to analyze the doping levels. Two
doublets were fitted to the spectra, with the 2p hybridization being
set at 1.1 eV as a fixed parameter and the 2p1/2 area being
half that of 2p3/2. These peaks were related to PEDOT with
2p3/2 being 163.8 eV and 2p1/2 164.9 eV for
charged PEDOT sites, with tosylate anions being in proximity of the
polymer unit found at 167.1 eV for 2p3/2 and 168.2 eV for
2p1/2 (see Figure 3a). The ratios of PEDOT to tosylate calculated from these
spectra and displayed in Figure 3c show higher doping levels in samples exposed to postpolymerization
heat treatment at 70 °C, with tosylate to PEDOT ratios changing
from 0.13 for the nontreated sample to nearly double: 0.22 in the
sample treated for 7.5 h. This result is in line with the observations
from the UV–vis–NIR spectroscopy displaying a decrease
in the Eg peak contributed to PEDOT:Tos
becoming more oxidized upon heat treatment.

Two complementary methods were used to analyze the doping
level
in PPy. As PPy does not contain sulfur in the polymer backbone, while
being present in the tosylate dopant, the atomic ratio of S 1s to
N 1s was used as a simple means of measuring the change in the doping
level. Additionally, N 1s spectra were analyzed and fitted with two
peaks: 399.8–400.0 eV related to neutral pyrrole rings and
401.8–402.0 eV related to oxidized pyrrole rings (see Figure 3b). Examining the
results of both methods and by comparing the ratios of N to S and
analyzing the fine structure of the N 1s peaks, one can reasonably
conclude that the thermal treatment has increased the doping level
of the PPy polymer (see Figure 3d), similar to what was observed for PEDOT:Tos.

To confirm
the changes in the PPy film are particular to postsynthesis
heat treatment, as most significant changes were observed in this
polymer, an additional study regarding the effect of polymerization
temperature was conducted and examined using XPS. PPy:Tos samples
were synthesized at polymerization temperatures between 60 and 110
°C, in 10 °C increments and rinsed immediately after polymerization.
The data are summarized in Table S3, and
no significant changes and trends in the data were observed. This
confirmed that the changes observed when using postsynthesis heat
treatment are particular to that process rather than simply a difference
due to the temperatures during VPP synthesis.

XPS only examines
the surface of the polymer thin film (approximately
10 nm depth). Therefore, further investigation using Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed to shed some light on the
structure of the “bulk” volume of the polymers and to
establish whether the changes were a surface phenomenon or indicative
of the entire polymer.

The FTIR spectra are presented in Figure 4 (background was
subtracted for better presentation)
and the full peak assignment with original spectra is presented in Tables S4 and S5. These spectra were confirmed
to be typical for PEDOT and PPy when compared to the spectra presented
in the literature.34,35Figure 4a for PEDOT showed no measurable differences
in the fingerprint region between pristine and heat-treated samples.
Both PEDOT and PPy displayed higher absorption of the broad bipolaron
absorption band (above 2000 cm–1 and typically extending
to the NIR region: see nonsubtracted spectra in Supporting Information S5 and S6) in the non-heat-treated
samples, which is in contrary to higher doping levels observed in
XPS and UV–vis–NIR analysis, suggesting other effects
present in the polymers.

film (showing no significant change before/after heat treatment);

Note: Dotted lines show peaks related to functional groups that have
changed after heat treatment; black lines are non-heat-treated samples;
and red lines are samples heat-treated for 7 h at 70 °C.

PPy:Tos samples, however, displayed
several changes in the fingerprint
region: peaks related to C=N stretching at 1384 cm–1, SO3– at 1174 cm–1, C–N+ bending at 1088 cm–1,
and C–H vibrations at 929 cm–1. These peaks
are related to the doped form of PPy and they exhibit increased absorption
for the heat-treated samples compared to the nontreated sample. Even
though this observation aligns with the XPS results confirming a larger
doping level in the polymer, it would typically lead to the contrary
response in the bipolaron band region to what was observed. This might
suggest that other changes in the polymer are occurring with heat
treatment, such as cross-linking, leading to disruption of conjugation.
Such a mechanism could explain higher rigidity of PPy:Tos observed
in the heat-treated polymer.

Additional information in relation
to the heat treatment process
was obtained from the waste material after the treated samples were
rinsed with ethanol. To our knowledge, this is the first report of
such an examination. Typically, the last step of the VPP process is
rinsing the surface with ethanol to remove the spent oxidant, unreacted
monomer, and other by-products in an attempt to “purify”
and compact the polymer film. The waste material was collected, pelletized
in KBr, dried (in ambient conditions), and analyzed using FTIR (see Figure 4c,d). When compared
with spectra of basic starting compounds used in the VPP process (see Supporting Information), the possible content
of the waste material must be the oxidant (iron(III)Tos, and/or reduced
iron(II)Tos), the block copolymer PEG–PPG–PEG, monomer,
and small oligomers.

The differences observed in the PEDOT:Tos
waste material postpolymerization
were larger than those in the waste material from PPy:Tos. In the
non-heat-treated sample of PEDOT:Tos, a larger relative absorption
was observed for several peaks related to the major peaks in the PEG–PPG–PEG
copolymer (refer to Figure S8) at 2969
cm–1, 2869 cm–1 (C–H vibrations),
1159 cm–1, 1348 cm–1 (C–H),
and 1107 cm–1 (C–O–C). This suggests
that there is a higher concentration of PEG–PPG–PEG
remaining in the heat-treated PEDOT:Tos polymer (as less PEG–PPG–PEG
was rinsed off into the waste material). The most pronounced change
in the FTIR spectra for the waste material from PPy:Tos polymer was
the larger relative intensities in the non-heat-treated sample for
peaks characteristic of iron(III) tosylate: at 1089 and 1047 cm–1. This result is consistent with the larger doping
levels recorded for the heat-treated samples observed in the XPS spectra.
Such differences between PEDOT:Tos and PPy:Tos suggest that the changes
upon heat treatment in two polymers are noticeably different. Lower
changes in the heat-treated PPy:Tos waste material compared to those
in the polymer suggest structural defects and possible cross-linking
combined with higher doping level being responsible for observed macroscopic
changes. In contrast, PEDOT:Tos did not present noticeable accumulation
of defects upon heat treatment, though still, a larger concentration
of dopant and PEG–PPG–PEG was observed in the polymer.
Such differences between PEDOT and PPy polymers are consistent with
the stability studies found in the literature, with PPy being found
less stable under ambient atmospheric conditions36 than PEDOT.37,38

Following the analysis
of structural changes, the electrical properties
of the conductive polymers were analyzed. The conductivity, σ,
of the polymeric films was calculated, as per the protocol described
in the Supporting Information, by measurement
of film sheet resistance and thickness, and is presented in Figure 5. All samples exhibited
a drop in conductivity during postpolymerization heat treatment, accompanied
by an increase in film thickness. Thicker films are most likely the
result of residual monomer being present within the oxidant (and/or
polymer) layers39,40 as the substrates are removed
from the VPP chamber. While exposed to the heat treatment, the polymerization
process is able to continue. The conductive polymer growth mechanism
proposed by Diaz,41 followed by Mueller,42 suggests that the polymer chain starts as a
dimer, followed by the addition of subsequent units onto the forming
polymer chain. On the basis of the observation of enhanced film cohesion
and increased film thickness, it is not unreasonable to expect polymers
with longer chains. The lower conductivity values are contrary to
the higher doping levels observed with XPS, FTIR, and UV–vis.
To some extent, this result may be explained by the growth of side
chains, cross-linking, or branching of the polymers having the major
effect on disturbing the conjugation and intrachain charge transfer.
In addition, a larger concentration of PEG–PPG–PEG was
observed in heat-treated samples. The PEG–PPG–PEG copolymer
resides at the conductive polymer grain boundaries,43 impairing intergrain hopping and hence decreasing the conductivity.

the film thickness as a function of thermal treatment time.

Finally, conductive polymers have
the ability to display an electrochromic
effect—a change of color upon electrochemical oxidation and
reduction.10,44 The effect of the postpolymerization
heat treatment on the performance of electrochromic devices, made
using PEDOT:Tos and PPy:Tos conductive polymers (each individually),
was investigated. Both polymers displayed differences in the UV–vis–NIR
spectra due to heat posttreatment, and further analysis was performed
to examine the effect of these changes on the electrochemistry of
the polymer and their spectra. To analyze the electrochemical response
and spectral changes, the polymers were tested in a three-electrode
cell, with transparent electrodes, allowing the measurement of optical
spectra while simultaneously being electrochemically oxidized and
reduced in a reversible manner.

The UV–vis–NIR
spectra of polymers analyzed in the
previous part of the manuscript (Figure 2) were of the “as-synthesized”
polymers, which were in the oxidized state, and the three-electrode
test allowed us to extend these observations to reduced forms of polymers.
As the changes due to heat treatment were observed in the optically
visible range of the spectrum, it produced a permanent change in the
color. For the PPy:Tos, there has been observed the difference in
color as presented in the insets of Figure 6a. Additionally, the cyclic voltammograms
of PPy:Tos samples showed distinctively different patterns for oxidation
potentials in treated and nontreated samples (see Figure 6c). Given that the shift in
the value of the antibonding state (expressed as change in the absorption
peak in the visible range of the UV–vis–NIR spectrum)
is permanent such that it does not change upon subsequent oxidation
and reduction, this difference has most likely been caused by structural
changes in the polymer, rather than simply a change in the doping
state. For the PEDOT:Tos samples, reducing the polymer electrochemically
(with optical spectrum presented in Figure 6b) allowed the measurement of the position
of the energy gap peak, which was not possible in the “as-synthesized”
polymers. No measurable change in the position of the energy gap was
observed, and minor changes in the optical performance were attributable
to variations in the film thickness. However, a noticeable shift in
the reduction potential (see Figure 6a,b) toward lower potentials for heat-treated samples
was observed in the cyclic voltammetry tests. This is in line with
other measurements for PEDOT:Tos, with this polymer showing less degradation
upon postpolymerization heat treatment, while improving the cohesion
of the polymer.

3 Conclusions
The influence of postpolymerization
heat treatment on the structure
and properties of vapor-phase-polymerized conductive polymers: PEDOT:Tos
and PPy:Tos was investigated. It was shown that the postsynthesis
heat treatment enabled the polymerization process to continue even
though the samples had been removed from the monomer source. This
growth continuation resulted in increased film robustness and integrity,
especially with respect to the PPy:Tos but also to the PEDOT:Tos film,
albeit to a lesser extent. Heat-treated polymers were shown to possess
a band gap structure characteristic of polymers having a higher oxidation
level compared to nontreated samples. This was confirmed by means
of compositional analysis, performed using XPS and FTIR, which showed
the heat-treated polymers to have a higher doping level. A higher
concentration of PEG–PPG–PEG block copolymer was also
present, most notably for the PPy:Tos sample. As a result of the incorporation
of additional block copolymer, the drawback was that the conductive
polymers exhibited lower film conductivity. Other likely additional
factors such as an increase in the polymer structure defects or cross-linking
polymer chains may have contributed to the overall observed changes
as indicated by the spectroelectrochemical analysis.

4 Materials and Methods
Iron(III) tosylate (Clevios CB54,
54 wt % in butanol) was received
from Heraeus. 3,4-Ethylenedioxythiophene monomer, PEG–PPG–PEG
(Mw = 5800 and 2900 g mol–1), and pyrrole, were purchased from Aldrich. Butanol and 100% undenatured
ethanol were purchased from Chem-Supply Pty. Ltd. Potassium bromide
(KBr) powder was supplied by Merck. All chemicals were used without
further purification.

Conductive polymers used in the study
were synthesized using the
VPP process according to Fabretto et al.29 An oxidant solution containing 3 g of Baytron CB54, 3 g of PEG–PPG–PEG
(Mw = 5800 g mol–1),
and 12 g of ethanol was made for the synthesis of PPy doped with tosylate
(PPy:Tos) films. The oxidant utilized for the synthesis of PEDOT doped
with tosylate (PEDOT:Tos) contained 3 g of Baytron CB54, 3 g of PEG–PPG–PEG
(Mw = 5800 g mol–1),
6 g of ethanol, and 1 g of butanol. The substrates were 76 ×
51 × 1 mm borosilicate glass supplied by ProSciTech. They were
rinsed with denatured ethanol and dried with deionized air. The oxidant
solution was pipetted onto the substrates and spin-coated (400B-6NPP,
Laurel Technologies Inc.) at a speed of 1500 rpm for 25 s. The substrates
were then placed into a VPP chamber in the presence of monomer.

The synthesis of PPy:Tos was performed in a VPP chamber composed
of a 16 L glass bell desiccator residing on a hot plate. The chamber
temperature was 70 °C and left to equilibrate for 60 min. Four
drops of pyrrole monomer were pipetted onto a microscope slide and
placed within the polymerization chamber 3 min prior to polymerization,
in order to saturate the chamber with monomer. The oxidant-coated
substrate was then placed in the chamber for 7 min while adding an
additional four drops of pyrrole monomer (to ensure a saturated vapor
environment).

The synthesis of PEDOT:Tos was performed using
the VPP technique
as per the protocol in the literature.6 EDOT monomer (four drops) was added to the polymerization chamber
(Binder 115L vacuum oven), and the oxidant-coated substrates were
then placed into the VPP chamber, kept at a pressure of 45 mbar and
a temperature of 35 ± 1 °C for 30 min.

Batches of
four conductive polymer samples were synthesized during
each run, to minimize the sample to sample variation in each experiment.
The control sample (not subjected to heat treatment) was removed and
spray-rinsed with ethanol and then dried with (filtered) compressed
air in order to remove any remaining oxidant, by-products, or unreacted
monomer. The rinsing procedure was repeated to afford a dry conductive
polymer film. This sample is also referred to as treated for “0
h” when presented in the figures. The samples heat-treated
for 2.5, 5, and 7 h were removed at the same time as the nontreated
sample but were transferred directly into an oven where they were
kept at 70 °C. Once removed from the oven, the treated samples
were rinsed in the same manner as previously described.

The
films were characterized by UV–vis–NIR spectroscopy
(Agilent Technologies, Cary), with the absorbance recorded in the
range of 300–2000 nm. Energy gap was calculated using the Tauc
method45 with more detailed description
included in the Supporting Information.
Elemental analysis was performed using XPS (SPECS SAGE, Phoibos 150-HSA)
using a Mg anode at a power setting of 200 W, with the samples cut
into 2 × 2 cm squares. Samples were grounded to the sample stage
with carbon tape during the measurements in order to minimize sample
charging. CasaXPS software was used for quantification of the results,
with which the relative atomic percentage change and doping levels
recorded for each sample.

Film thickness was measured using
a mechanical profilometer (Dektak
model from Bruker). The polymer samples were scribed using a soft
scalpel in the central parts of microscope slides, and the step height
between the glass substrate and the film surface was recorded. The
depth profile was measured at 10 different locations in order to obtain
an average measurement.

The sheet resistance (Rs) of each sample
was measured using a four-point probe from Jandel Engineering (RM3
Drive Unit, 500 μm tip, 60 g load, 1 mm tip spacing), and the
value was calculated as the average of 10 measurements across the
substrate. The current applied was varied from 5 μA up to 10
nA, depending on the sample so as to obtain a voltage in the range
of 1–10 mV (optimal equipment range). Conductivity of the polymer
films was calculated as per the procedure described in the Supporting Information, and the standard deviations
were calculated using the propagation of uncertainty principle.

FTIR spectra were collected in transmission mode using a Nicolet
Model Magna-IR 750. The PEDOT:Tos samples analyzed with FTIR were
transferred as membranes onto a support Al mesh so that only the polymer
film was analyzed (no substrate interference). The PPy conductive
polymers were ground with potassium bromide (KBr) and pressed into
pellets for analysis.

The electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical
studies were performed
in an in-house-built three-electrode cell with a VoltaLab PGZ100 All-In-One
potentiostat controlled by VoltaMaster 4 Electrochemical Software
and a HunterLab Pro spectrophotometer. The working electrode was ITO-coated
glass (from Kaivo) (Rs < 7 Ω/sq, T > 80%), with conductive polymers deposited onto this
electrode.
Clear ITO-coated glass was used as the auxiliary electrode, and silver
wire (99.9% Ag from Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the reference electrode.
The reference electrode was polished with 600 grit abrasive paper
and rinsed thoroughly with ethanol before each test. The electrolyte
was [BMP][TFSI], obtained from Merck Millipore.
