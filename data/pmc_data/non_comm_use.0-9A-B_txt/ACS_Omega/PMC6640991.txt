Irradiation of samples of diborane(6),
B2H6 and B2D6, separately
and together, dispersed
in solid neon near 4 K with tunable far-ultraviolet light from a synchrotron
yielded new infrared absorption lines that are assigned to several
carriers. Besides H, B, BH, BH2, BH3, B2, B2H2, and B2H4, previously identified, a further species is assigned on the basis
of quantum-chemical calculations of vibrational wavenumbers and intensities
to be cyc-B3H3 (D3h, singlet state) in several isotopic
variants, which feature three bridging B–H–B bonds in
a six-membered ring.

1 Introduction
Boron compounds have novel
molecular structures. Among the boron
species, boron hydrides, boranes, exhibit unique bonding features
in their molecular structures and have drawn much interest because of their unique chemical
properties.1−6 The hydrides of boron and carbon have disparate molecular structures;
for instance, B2H6 exhibits bonding patterns
remarkably distinct from those of C2H6. Thus,
the molecular structure of diborane(6) attracts particular attention
with four terminal hydrogen bonds (B–H) and two peculiar bridging
hydrogen bonds (B–H–B).7−10 For this reason, boranes fascinate chemists
for their atypical molecular structures.

An exploration of the
spectra of not only compounds stable at 300
K but also the radicals and intermediate species that can be trapped
in inert environments provides fascinating new knowledge about their
structures, from which concepts of bonding are developed. In experiments
involving the irradiation of diborane(6) dispersed in solid neon near
4 K with tunable far-ultraviolet (FUV) light from a synchrotron, we
identified, among various new lines in infrared absorption spectra
after photolysis, signals assigned to several boron hydrides, including
BH, BH2, BH3, B2H2, and
B2H4;11 from visible
and ultraviolet spectra in emission or absorption, we assigned signals
also to B, H, and B2.12

A further new species is identified here on the basis of quantum-chemical
calculations of vibrational wavenumbers and intensities of several
isotopic variants, as cyc-B3H3 (D3h) in a singlet
electronic state, which features three bridging B–H–B
bonds in a novel six-membered ring. Such a structure has no precedent
among diverse boron hydrides or even hydrides of other elements.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows infrared
absorption spectra, over the recorded range 500–2700 cm–1, of precursors B2H6 and B2D6 with B in natural abundance, dispersed in solid
neon (1:1000) after deposition for 2 h at 4 K. For boron in natural
abundance with two stable isotopic variants, 0.801 11B
and 0.199 10B, the ratio of species 11B2H6 or 11B2D6/11B10BH6 or 11B10BD6/10B2H6 or 10B2D6 is hence about 16:8:1. The spectra of
B2H6 in natural abundance display many absorption
features of which the proximity and ratios of lines enable a clear
assignment to triplets of isotopic boron species containing 11B2, 11B10B, and 10B2, generally in the order of increasing wavenumber. We reported
a detailed analysis of the infrared and ultraviolet absorption spectra
of diborane(6) dispersed in solid neon at 4 K.13Figure 1 marks the notable vibrational modes observed; for instance, the
lines of 11B2H6/11B2D6 were recorded at 974.8/723.2 (ν9), 1172.1/873.8 (ν18), 1597.73/1195.0 (ν17), 1855.5/1321.3 (ν5 + ν15), 1877.9/1475.2 (ν8), 1990.2/1396.9 (ν13 + ν15), 2344.9/1770.9 (ν3 + ν18), 2521.8/1846.5 (ν16), and
2610.6/1977.2 (ν12) cm–1.

Figure 1 IR absorption
spectra of diborane(6) dispersed in solid neon at
4 K: (a) B2H6/Ne = 1:1000; (b) B2D6/Ne = 1:1000; and (c) B2H6/Ne
= 1:1000 and B2D6/Ne = 1:1000, deposited through
separate jets to preclude mixing before the formation of the deposit.

To generate various transient
species, we irradiated diborane(6)
dispersed in solid neon at near 4 K with tunable FUV light from the
undulator of a synchrotron. Figures 2a and 3a display the partial
infrared difference absorption spectra after photolysis at 121.6 nm
for 76 min at 4 K from samples B2D6/Ne = 1:1000
and B2H6/Ne = 1:1000, respectively. Our difference
spectra are derived upon subtracting the spectra recorded after irradiation
from the spectrum before irradiation; in these spectra, the lines
pointing upward indicate production and the lines pointing downward
indicate destruction. In addition to the infrared absorption lines
assigned previously,11,12 the lines in sets with similar
temporal profiles of production appeared after photolysis at specific
selected wavelengths, which we discuss here.

and (b) from simulations. Some assignments are indicated.

nm for
76 min (resolution 0.5 cm–1 from 1000 co-added interferograms)
and (b) from simulations. Some assignments are indicated.

To aid assignments of the latter lines, we undertook
quantum-chemical
calculations of equilibrium structures, harmonic vibrational wavenumbers,
infrared intensities, and energies of selected boron hydrides (program
Gaussian 09, B3LYP density functionals, both local and nonlocal terms
augmented with correlation-consistent polarized-valence basis set
triplet-zeta, aug-cc-pVTZ).

No stable triboron hydride is known,
but among the transient species
that might be trapped in solid neon, after monoboron and diboron hydrides,
the most likely species are triboron hydrides. Hence, in our calculations,
these species included acyclic triboron hydrides B3H3 (Cs) and B3H3 (C2v) and cyclic hydrides B3H3 (C2v), B3H3 (D3h), and B3H32–, all of which are at least metastable;
their wavenumbers and intensities are listed in the Supporting Information.

The attribution of lines in
an infrared absorption spectrum to
various prospective new species within an unknown mixture is a challenging
task. Our quantum-chemical calculations (Table 1) indicated that for 11B3D3, that is the dominant isotopic variant containing deuterium,
two lines at 868.0 (ν5) and 828.3 cm–1 (ν6) are characteristic of a cyclic triboron species,
B3H3 (D3h), the molecular structure of which in a singlet electronic
spin state is shown in Figure 4; the corresponding triplet state is merely a saddle point
with imaginary frequencies. These calculated wavenumbers and relative
intensities correlate closely with the two features in the experimental
spectrum at 857.2 and 820.6 cm–1, as shown in Figure 2a, according to both
their wavenumbers and intensities; for comparison with the calculated
ratio 0.63 of the respective intensities, the experimental ratio of
integrated intensities is ∼0.58, and that ratio is satisfactorily
constant in various experiments with B2D6. The
two calculated vibrational modes are respectively ν5 and ν6, both of symmetry class E′. The corresponding modes of 11B3H3 are calculated to have wavenumbers 1186.7 cm–1 for ν5 and 1120.2 cm–1 for ν6, but in this case, the calculated intensity of the former
is about 18 times that of the latter. Appropriate features in recorded
spectra appear near 1209.1 cm–1 for ν5 and, barely visibly, 1145.5 cm–1 for ν6, as displayed in Figure 3a.

a Vibrational wavenumbers are calculated
with program Gaussian 09, the B3LYP method, and basis set aug-cc-pVTZ
(B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ); the calculated vibrational wavenumbers are scaled
by 0.967; and the calculated intensities are in units of km mol–1.

The recorded
spectrum contains contributions from the isotopic
variants of boron in natural abundance; when we took into account
the spectral structure of B3H3 resulting from
these isotopes, we derived the simulated spectra, with wavenumbers
slightly shifted to aid comparison, in Figures 3b and 2b, for comparison
with partial difference infrared absorption spectra recorded in the
region 1120–1260 cm–1 after photolysis of
B2H6 and 810–880 cm–1 after photolysis of B2D6 in Figures 3a and 2a, respectively.

The lines attributed to cyclic B3H3 were
detected after photolysis of B2H6 dispersed
in neon at 1:1000 and wavelengths 121.6–180 nm but not observed
at 200 and 220 nm; weak signals of cyclic B3H3 were also recorded after irradiation at wavelengths of only 121.6–180
nm for B2H6/Ne = 1:2000 and 1:10 000, with weak
signals also of BH3. With addition of hydrogen, so that
initially B2H6/H2/Ne = 1:6:1000,
the lines of cyclic B3H3 were observed for wavelengths
121.6–180 nm, still not detected at 220 nm, and the intensity
of signals of BH3 relatively increased under the same conditions
(see Supporting Information). There was
no evidence for photochemical decomposition of cyclic B3H3 at any tested wavelength. Just as the addition of H2 to the neon matrix promoted the production of carbon aggregates
up to C20 after the photolysis of CH4,14 the addition of H2 with B2H6 in solid Ne promoted the production of cyclic B3H3 in our subsequent experiments.

Table 1 shows that,
because 11B3H3 and 11B3D3 have a highly symmetric structure, vibrational
modes ν5 and ν6 are the only fundamental
modes that are active in infrared absorption within the range of our
detection, 500–4000 cm–1. Figure 5a,b shows that most amplitudes
of the vibrational motion of the atoms in modes ν5 and ν6 involve the H atomic centers; as these modes
are degenerate, we show only one component of each mode. The relative
motions of the B and H atoms in these modes indicate that the nature
of the vibrations involves both the stretching of the B–H bonds
and the deformation of the B–H–B angles. The similarity
of these experimental and calculated spectra of B3H3 and the lack of agreement for other possible species indicate
the likely detection of a cyclic triborane(3) for the first time.

show the relative displacements of the H atoms; the small corresponding
displacements of the B atomic centers are within the spheres denoting
those atoms.

To confirm the assignment
of cyclic triborane(3), we employed photolysis
of a mixed sample of B2H6 and B2D6 dispersed in solid neon with selected FUV light at 4 K. Initially,
we prepared a gaseous sample of B2H6/B2D6/Ne = 1:1:1000 at 295 K; after mixing overnight, we
then deposited this gaseous mixture on a cold target at 4 K, but we
observed that the IR spectrum of this precursor was complicated; with
detailed analysis, we identified the lines associated with various
isotopic species B2H6, B2DH5, B2D2H4, B2D3H3, B2D4H2, B2D5H, and B2D6. This result confirms
that gaseous B2H6 and B2D6 exchange H and D freely at 295 K15 to
generate in total 21 isotopic variants in our sample. Photolysis of
this complicated sample produced many unknown lines.

To avoid
that isotopic exchange between B2H6 and B2D6, we adopted a scheme for co-deposition
of gaseous B2H6/Ne = 1:1000 and B2D6/Ne = 1:1000; each mixture was deposited concurrently
from a separate inlet at an angle of angle 90° to one another,
so that mixing occurred directly above the surface of the cold target
at 4 K. The IR spectrum of thus-prepared B2H6/Ne = 1:1000 and B2D6/Ne = 1:1000 recorded
before photolysis is shown in Figure 1c. On comparison within Figure 1, it is observed that curve c resembles closely
a sum of curves a (B2H6/Ne = 1:1000) and b (B2D6/Ne = 1:1000); this result indicates that isotopic
exchange was avoided in this mixed sample as a result of the separate co-deposition.

Figure 6 displays
the partial infrared absorption difference spectrum of the co-deposited
sample for B2H6/Ne = 1:1000 and B2D6/Ne = 1:1000 upon irradiation at 121.6 nm for 76 min
at 4 K. Apart from the lines recorded for isotopic variants cyc-B3H3 and cyc-B3D3, as shown in Figures 2 and 3 and listed
in Table 1, other new
weak lines were detected in Figure 6. As mentioned above, fragments including H, B, BH,
BH2, and BH3 are formed in the photochemical
system of B2H6 and D, BD, BD2, and
BD3 are formed from B2D6. In addition
to products cyc-B3H3 and cyc-B3D3, other isotopic variants
including cyc-B3DH2 and cyc-B3D2H might be generated after
photochemical decomposition of mixtures of B2H6 and B2D6 dispersed in solid neon. To identify
these species, we performed further quantum-chemical calculations
of the vibrational modes and their intensities for cyc-B3DH2 and cyc-B3D2H; the results are listed in Table 2. For these isomers, only one geometric structure
exists for isomers cyc-11B3DH2, cyc-10B3DH2, cyc-11B3D2H, and cyc-10B3D2H, whereas two geometric structures are possible for cyc-11B210BDH2, cyc-11B10B2DH2, cyc-11B210BD2H, and cyc-11B10B2D2H, named structures a and b in Table 2.
For diborane(6) in
natural abundance, the proportions of products cyc-10B3DH2 and cyc-10B3D2H are too small to be observed
in these experiments.

a Vibrational wavenumbers are calculated
with program Gaussian 09, the B3LYP method, and basis set aug-cc-pVTZ
(B3LYP/ aug-cc-pVTZ); the calculated vibrational wavenumbers are scaled
by 0.967; and the calculated intensities are in units of km mol–1.

According
to the calculated results, the most intense mode, ν2, of cyc-11B3DH2, cyc-11B210BDH2 (a), and cyc-11B10B2DH2 (a) and mode ν3 of cyc-11B210BDH2 (b) and cyc-11B10B2DH2 (b) are located in our detection range 1165–1190
cm–1, but absorption from the precursors strongly
interfered with, and precluded, the detection of the lines in this
region for these species. On the basis of our calculations, we identified
other lines for modes ν9 and ν11 of cyc-11B3DH2, cyc-11B210BDH2 (a), and cyc-11B10B2DH2 (a); of modes ν3, ν9, and ν10 of cyc-11B3D2H, cyc-11B210BD2H (a), and cyc-11B10B2D2H (a); and of
modes ν1 and ν5 of cyc-11B210BDH2 (b), cyc-11B10B2DH2 (b), cyc-11B210BD2H (b), and 11B10B2D2H (b), as listed in Table 2.

The calculated standard enthalpy
of formation of cyclic B3H3 as depicted in Figure 4 is 1240.3 kJ mol–1; in comparison,
the calculated enthalpy of BH is 439.2 kJ mol–1 and
of linear B2H2 (D∞h) is 501.7 kJ mol–1. The sum of
the latter enthalpies, for species already identified in our spectra,
is significantly less than that calculated for cyclic B3H3, shown in Figure 4, but that difference has little meaning in the context
of molecular fragments dispersed in solid neon at 4 K.

Other
calculated stable structures according to formula B3H3 include a triangular B3 moiety with one
bridging H and two terminal H’s at 487.4 kJ mol–1, a linear B3 moiety with two terminal H’s at one
end and one terminal H at the other at 614.5 kJ mol–1, and a triangular B3 moiety (C2v) of which each B has an associated terminal H atom
at 526.3 kJ mol–1, but in no case is there a satisfactory
match between calculated and experimental wavenumbers and relative
intensities of infrared spectral lines. The Supporting Information presents figures displaying the calculated molecular
structures and tables of the wavenumbers and intensities of the corresponding
fundamental vibrational modes.

The nonlinear hydrogen bonds
in this calculated structure have
little precedent as bonds within a molecule, although intermolecular
hydrogen bonds of this kind are known. For any molecule, the largest
calculated wavenumbers for fundamental modes are generally associated
with the stretching of strong chemical bonds; for B3H3 in Table 1, with magnitudes explicitly 1319.5 (ν1, A1′), 1473.2 (ν3, A2′), 1186.7 (ν5, E ′), and 1120.2 (ν6, E ′) cm–1, these wavenumbers are about half
of those for the terminal B–H stretching modes, about 2600
cm–1, and are much smaller than even those for the
stretching modes of the bridging B–H–B bonds, about
1900 cm–1, for B2H6. Two of
those four wavenumbers, for modes ν5 and ν6, correspond to the assigned experimental spectral features
and their counterparts for B3D3; the diagram
of atomic displacements in Figure 5 indicates that these modes involve both bond stretching
and angular deformation. The calculated distances for B–H (0.14
nm) and B–B (0.26 nm) are likewise much larger than the corresponding
distances between adjacent atomic centers in other boron hydrides,
such as B–H (0.13 nm) and B–B (0.16 nm) in diborane(6).
These properties are consistent with the large enthalpy of formation
of this remarkable species.

The crucial evidence for the existence
and detection of such a
bizarre species in its several isotopic variants is the undeniable
match of calculated and experimental wavenumbers and relative intensities,
which provides confidence in our identification. The differences between
the calculated and experimental data are entirely comparable with
those of B2H6 itself, for which the mean magnitude
of deviation between the scaled harmonic and experimental wavenumbers
for the gaseous state is about 17 cm–1 (cf. Supporting Information).

3 Experimental
Section
The apparatus for photochemical experiments on solid
samples using
FUV light from a synchrotron was described previously.16,17 The radiation for photolysis was selected from an undulator on beamline
21A2 attached to the 1.5 GeV synchrotron in Taiwan Light Source at
the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC). This beamline
provides pseudocontinuous FUV light with photon flux of ∼1016 photons s–1 (2% bandwidth); after absorption
by Ar (pressure 1.33 kPa) and a filter, crystalline LiF for 121.6
nm, CaF2 for 130, 140, and 155 nm, silica (Suprasil) for
165 and 175 nm, and quartz for 185, 190, and 200 nm, to suppress harmonics
from the undulator, the selected FUV light delivers about ∼1015 photons s–1.

IR absorption spectra
were recorded with an interferometric spectrometer
(Bomem DA8) equipped with a KBr beamsplitter and a HgCdTe detector
(cooled to 77 K) to span the spectral range 500–4000 cm–1; spectra were typically recorded with 1000 scans
and with a resolution of 0.5 cm–1. Gaseous samples
comprising diborane(6) in neon were deposited on a cold KBr disc window;
a closed-cycle refrigerator (Janis RDK-415) cooled the KBr substrate
to ∼4 K within an enclosure evacuated to <4 μPa. Before
and after irradiation of the sample for cumulative periods from 2
to 6 h in a programmed sequence, we recorded IR spectra at each stage
of the experiment. Difference spectra, that is, the absorbance curve
after irradiation of a sample with FUV light for some period minus
the absorbance curve before irradiation, emphasize the variation of
the chemical composition resulting from photolysis.

Gaseous
B2H6 or B2D6 (Voltaix,
chemical purities B2H6 99.99% and
B2D6 99.8%) was received as 10% in He and degassed
at liquid nitrogen temperature before dilution in neon. Gaseous neon
(Scott Specialty Gases, purity 99.999%) was used without purification.

4 Conclusions
Irradiation of diborane(6) dispersed in
solid neon at 4 K with
FUV radiation selected from a synchrotron as a source yielded infrared
absorption lines due to a new boron-hydride species that we assign,
on the basis of quantum-chemical calculations of vibrational wavenumbers
and intensities, to a carrier cyc-B3H3 (D3h) that contains
three bridging B–H–B bonds in a six-membered ring. The
cumulative spectral evidence for the existence
of B3H3 in its several isotopic variants provides
a strong basis for our assignment to this unprecedented species.
