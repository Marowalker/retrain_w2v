Many quinazoline
derivatives have been synthesized over the last
few decades with great pharmacological potential, such as antimalarial,
anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anticancer, and antiviral. But so
far, no quinazoline–artemisinin hybrids have been reported
in the literature. In the present study, five novel quinazoline–artemisinin
hybrids were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro biological
activity against malarial parasites (Plasmodium falciparum 3D7), leukemia cells (CCRF-CEM and CEM/ADR5000), and human cytomegalovirus.
Remarkably, hybrid 9 (EC50 = 1.4 nM), the
most active antimalarial compound of this study, was not only more
potent than artesunic acid (EC50 = 9.7 nM) but at the same
time more active than the clinically used drugs dihydroartemisinin
(EC50 = 2.4 nM) and chloroquine (EC50 = 9.8
nM). Furthermore, hybrids 9 and 10 were
the most potent compounds with regard to anticytomegaloviral activity
(EC50 = 0.15–0.21 μM). They were able to outperform
ganciclovir (EC50 = 2.6 μM), which is the relevant
standard drug of antiviral therapy, by a factor of 12–17. Moreover,
we identified a new highly active quinazoline derivative, compound 14, that is most effective in suppressing cytomegalovirus
replication with an EC50 value in the nanomolar range (EC50 = 50 nM). In addition, hybrid 9 exhibited an
antileukemia effect similar to that of artesunic acid, with EC50 values in the low micromolar range, and was 45 times more
active toward the multidrug-resistant CEM/ADR5000 cells (EC50 = 0.5 μM) than the standard drug doxorubicin.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
quinazoline scaffold, which consists of two fused six-membered
aromatic rings benzene and pyrimidine, plays a fundamental role in
today’s discovery and design of new drugs due to its wide-ranging
pharmacological properties, such as antimicrobial,1−3 antimalarial,4,5 anti-inflammatory,6−8 anticancer,9−11 and antiviral.12,13 One of the first quinazoline derivatives, which was found to have
very promising biological efficacy, was the natural occurring alkaloid
febrifugine (1) (Figure 1). The compound was isolated 60 years ago from the
Chinese plant aseru (Dichroa febrifuga Lour), which has been applied as an antimalarial agent in traditional
Chinese medicine for over 2000 years.14−16 Since the discovery
of febrifugine (1), the quinazoline moiety became one
of the most studied motifs in medicinal chemistry, and as a consequence,
a great variety of quinazoline derivatives exhibiting diverse biological
activities have been synthesized in the past few decades.17−21 Selected examples are displayed in Figure 1: gefitinib (2a), an epidermal
growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), which
is already used clinically for the treatment of non-small-cell lung
carcinoma;22,23 lapatinib (2b),
an orally active drug against breast cancer;24 and two other synthetic 4-anilinoquinazoline derivatives: compound 3, which possesses anticytomegaloviral activity,13 and compound 4, which is effective
even in vivo against malarial parasites.5

Figure 1 Biologically
active quinazoline derivatives: febrifugine (1) (antimalarial),
gefitinib (2a), lapatinib
(2b) (anticancer), and two other synthetic 4-anilinoquinazoline
derivatives 3 (anti-human cytomegalovirus (anti-HCMV))
and 4 (antimalarial), as well as the structure of artemisinin
(5).

To enhance the pharmacological
properties of the available quinazoline
drugs and to counter the spread of resistance, especially toward malaria
and cancer, we intended to apply the so-called molecular hybridization,
which is a relatively new concept in drug design and development,
wherein at least two different pharmacophoric moieties originating
from different bioactive substances are combined into one single structure.25−28 The resulting hybrids have, in many cases, improved pharmacological
properties compared to those of their parent drugs, such as increased
biological efficacy, reduced undesired side effects, a modified selectivity
profile (lower toxicity), better bioavailability, and sometimes even
completely new biological features that were absent in the parent
compounds.28−32 The second pharmacologically active substance we chose besides quinazoline
for the hybridization was artemisinin (5), which is an
enantiomerically pure sesquiterpene with a 1,2,4-trioxane heterocycle
and was first isolated in 1972 from the Chinese medicinal plant Artemisia annua L. by Youyou Tu (Nobel Prize 2015).33 Artemisinin was selected by us not only because
of its known antimalarial34−37 and anticancer potential38,39 but also due to our promising experiences in the past with artemisinin-based
hybrids.40−44

In this study, we report the synthesis of five novel quinazoline–artemisinin
hybrids 6–10 (Figure 2), which were investigated for their inhibitory
potency against the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 strain, the leukemia cell lines CCRF-CEM and CEM/ADR5000, and
HCMV.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Chemistry
Quinazoline derivatives 11, 12, and 14 (Figure 3, Scheme 1), which were necessary for the synthesis
of hybrids 6−10 (Scheme 2), were prepared in analogy
to a literature-known procedure developed by Wang et al. in 2014.45 Applying the Steglich esterification reaction,
it was possible to couple artesunic acid (16), a semisynthetic
derivative of artemisinin (5), directly with quinazoline
derivative 11 containing a phenol moiety, yielding the
desired hybrid 6 in 60% (Scheme 2). The reaction was performed using N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC)
and 4-(dimethylamino)-pyridine (DMAP) as coupling agents and a mixture
of CH3CN and ethyl acetate (EtOAc) as the solvent.

for hybrids presented in this work.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Quinazoline-Derived Precursors 13 and 15
Scheme 2 Synthesis Route for Hybrids 6–10
To be able to synthesize the
other quinazoline–artemisinin
hybrids, 7–10 (Scheme 2), further modifications of quinazoline derivatives 12 and 14 were required (Scheme 1). Quinazoline 12 was converted
into an alcohol, 13, by N-alkylation
of the secondary amine using 3-bromopropanol as the reagent, K2CO3 as the base, TBAI as the additive, and CH3CN as the solvent. After refluxing the reaction mixture overnight,
the product could be isolated in 22% yield. Conversion of the aromatic
nitro group of new quinazoline 14 to the corresponding
primary amine was realized by hydrazine monohydrate-mediated reduction
catalyzed by Raney-Ni.

This procedure, which is already reported
in the literature in
context of the synthesis of other simple aromatic amino compounds,46 afforded quinazoline amine 15 in
87% yield. These two quinazoline precursors, 13 and 15, were then coupled with either artesunic acid (16) or artemisinin-derived carboxylic acid 17 to furnish
hybrids 7–10: Steglich conditions
(DCC, DMAP) afforded ester hybrids 7/8 in
35/49% yield, and standard amide coupling (EDCI/1-hydroxybenzotriazole
(HOBt), DIPEA) gave amide hybrids 9/10 in
64/68% yield. Artemisinin-derived acid 17 was synthesized
from dihydroartemisinin (DHA) according to the literature (Scheme 2)47 and was chosen as the starting material for the hybrid
synthesis, as it belongs to the group of C-10 nonacetals, which are
known to be more hydrolytically stable than common artemisinin derivatives,
such as artesunic acid (16).48

The stability of all our new target compounds 6–10 was tested by heating them for 20 h at 60
°C. After
utilizing these conditions, less than 5% decomposition was observed
via 1H NMR spectroscopy, indicating that all synthesized
hybrids are sufficiently stable.

2.2 Biological
Evaluation and Discussion
2.2.1 Cytotoxicity toward P. falciparum 3D7
The antimalarial activity
of all synthesized hybrids 6–10, as well as their
parent compounds artesunic acid
(16) and quinazoline derivatives 12 and 14, was evaluated in vitro against P. falciparum 3D7 (Table 1).

Dihydrartemisinin, Artesunic Acid (16), Quinazoline Derivatives 12 and 14, and Hybrids 6–10 Tested against P. falciparum 3D7 Parasites

10	613.54	39.9 ± 0.8	
a EC50 values have been
previously reported.44

In general, it can be said that
all hybrids exhibit excellent antimalarial
efficacy with EC50 values within the nanomolar range (1.4–39.9
nM). This is quite remarkable because their corresponding quinazoline
precursors 12 and 14 only exhibit antimalarial
activities in the low micromolar and moderate nanomolar ranges (EC50 = 148–3177 nM). All hybrids except for hybrid 10 (EC50 = 39.9 nM) had a similar or even higher
activity than that of the tested reference compound, artesunic acid
(16) (EC50 = 9.7 nM), and clinically used
chloroquine (EC50 = 9.8 nM). The most active compounds
in this study concerning antimalarial efficacy were hybrids 6 (EC50 = 3.8 nM) and 9 (EC50 = 1.4 nM), which were comparable to or even more active than the
clinically used drug DHA (EC50 = 2.4 nM). On analyzing
the structure–activity relationship of the hybrids, interesting
observations can be made. C-10 acetal hybrid 9 is 30
times more active than hybrid 10, which contains a C-10
nonacetal-linked artemisinin subunit. In consequence, a C-10 acetal
linkage seems to be beneficial for antimalarial activity in the case
of quinazoline–artemisinin hybrids.

A contrary effect
was observed in connection with artemisin-derived
dimers,49 which supports the assumption
that the underlying mechanism of action might be different. The free
secondary amine group of 4-anilinoquinazoline-derived hybrids seems
to play an important role with regard to antimalarial efficacy, as
hybrids 7 and 8, in which the artemisinin
moiety is attached to the N-atom of the aniline subunit, are approximately
up to 10 times less active than hybrids 6 and 9. Therefore, the functionalized aromatic subunits in 4-anilinoquinazoline
derivatives should be used for hybridization, and the secondary amine
should be left untouched.

2.2.2 Inhibitory Activity against
HCMV in Primary
Human Fibroblasts
The antiviral activity of compounds was
investigated for HCMV, strain AD169-GFP. This recombinant virus expresses
the green fluorescent protein (GFP) that can be reliably quantitated
as a reporter of viral replication (Table 2). Infection experiments were carried out
with cultures of primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs), and measurements
of antiviral activity were performed according to an already published
protocol.50−52 Used as two reference compounds, artesunic acid (16) and ganciclovir both exerted strong anti-HCMV activity
at EC50 levels of 3.80 and 2.60 μM, respectively,
and were compared to that of the novel quinazoline–artemisinin
hybrids. Four of five hybrids analyzed showed anti-HCMV activity in
the submicromolar range with EC50 values of 0.86 μM
(hybrid 7), 0.65 μM (hybrid 8), 0.21
μM (hybrid 9), and 0.15 μM (hybrid 10; the fifth compound, hybrid 6, was less active
but still showed anti-HCMV activity in the low micromolar range, with
EC50 = 5.89 μM). Thus, these hybrids were up to 17-fold
more effective than the reference drug ganciclovir.

b EC50 values have been
previously reported.54

We concluded from these data that
a similar structure–activity
trend refers to the anti-HCMV activity as already previously stated
for antimalarial efficacy. Hybrids 7 and 8, in which the secondary amine group of the 4-anilinoquinazoline
derivatives were used for hybridization, were less active than hybrids 9 and 10 with the free secondary amine group.
This effect was even more pronounced for quinazoline precursors 12 and 13: quinazoline derivative 12 possessed an efficacy comparable to that of ganciclovir (EC50 = 2.01 μM), whereas compound 13 was completely
inactive (EC50 > 10 μM). However, unlike antimalarial
efficacy, C-10 nonacetal-linked artemisinin-derived hybrids 8 and 10 were more potent against HCMV than their
corresponding C-10 acetal-linked counterparts (hybrids 7 and 9).

The highest antiviral efficacy in vitro
among the tested hybrids
was noted for hybrid 10; therefore, it is tempting to
speculate whether the specific chemical nature of this hybrid compound
may combine in an optimized manner the antiviral mechanisms displayed
by artesunic acid and quinazolines. Previous reports demonstrated
that the antiviral mode of action of artesunic acid is based on its
signaling-inhibitory potential, particularly its interference with
the canonical NF-κB (RelA/p65) pathway,55−57 whereas quinazolines
typically act on the basis of a direct catalytic inhibition of viral
and cellular protein kinases.57−60 For these compounds, no or only modest signs of cytotoxicity
were detectable on HFFs up to a concentration of 10 μM, as routinely
monitored by light and fluorescence microscopy, thus strongly arguing
for a specific antiviral effect. Combined, these results indicate
a strong anti-HCMV potential of quinazoline–artemisinin hybrids.

Surprisingly, the most active compound tested in this study against
HCMV was new quinazoline 14 with an EC50 value
in the nanomolar range (50 nM). The compound exerted a 50-fold higher
activity than the standard drug ganciclovir and also 40-fold higher
activity than other tested quinazoline derivatives 12 and 13.

2.2.3 Cytotoxicity toward Sensitive
CCRF-CEM and
Multidrug-Resistant CEM/ADR5000 Leukemia Cells
The most promising
hybrids in this study, 9 and 10, and its
precursor, 14, were tested for a potential in vitro antileukemia
effect in sensitive wild-type CCRF-CEM and multidrug-resistant P-glycoprotein-overexpressing
CEM/ADR5000 cells (Table 3). Hybrid 10 and precursor 14 showed
no promising antileukemia behavior. In contarst, hybrid 9 with EC50 values of 2.8 μM (CCRF-CEM) and 0.5 μM
(CEM/ADR5000) exhibited an antileukemia effect similar to that of
artesunic acid. Especially, the activity against the multidrug-resistant
CEM/ADR5000 cells is quite promising, as it is 45 times higher than
that of doxorubicin (EC50 = 23.27 μM). This is important
as drug resistance is one of the biggest challenges to be overcome
in current cancer treatment.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, five quinazoline–artemisinin-derived
hybrids, 6–10, were successfully
synthesized and
investigated for the first time for their antimalarial, antiviral,
and antileukemia activity. All novel quinazoline–artemisinin
hybrids showed high antimalarial efficacy against the P. falciparum 3D7 strain (EC50 = 1.4–39.9
nM), which was better or comparable to that of artesunic acid (EC50 = 9.7 nM). Remarkably, hybrid 9 (EC50 = 1.4 nM) was even more active than the clinically used drugs DHA
(EC50 = 2.4 nM) and chloroquine (EC50 = 9.8
nM). With EC50 values of 0.15–0.21 μM, compounds 9 and 10 were most potent in the inhibition of
HCMV replication in primary cell cultures, surpassing the antiviral
activity of ganciclovir by factors 12–17. In the course of
this study, we also characterized a novel, highly active new quinazoline 14 that was most active with an EC50 in the nanomolar
range (HCMV EC50 = 50 nM). Moreover, hybrid 9 showed an antileukemia effect similar to that of artesunic acid
with EC50 values in the low micromolar range and was 45
times more active toward the multidrug-resistant CEM/ADR5000 cells
(EC50 = 0.6 μM) than the standard drug doxorubicin.
These promising results further underline the high potential of the
hybridization concept for further investigations and hybrid-based
drug design.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemistry
4.1.1 Synthesis of Hybrid Molecules:
General
All reactions were performed in flame-dried glassware
under a nitrogen
atmosphere. If necessary, the synthesized hybrids were further purified
after column chromatography via reprecipitation from CH2Cl2 in n-hexane to yield a pure compound
for elemental analysis and biological tests. EtOAc was purchased as
an anhydrous solvent. CH2Cl2 was dried initially
over CaCl2 and then distilled from P2O5. All other solvents were purified by distillation using rotary evaporation
or were purchased in high-performance liquid chromatography-quality.
Reagents obtained from commercial sources were used without further
purification. Thin-layer chromatography was performed on precoated
aluminum silica gel SIL G/UV254 plates (Macherey-Nagel & Co.).
The detection occurred via fluorescence quenching or development in
a phosphomolybdic acid solution (10% in EtOH). All products were dried
under high vacuum (10–3 mbar). 1H NMR
and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature (rt)
either on a Bruker Avance spectrometer operating at 300 and 400 MHz,
respectively, or on a JEOL JNM GX 400 spectrometer operating at 400
MHz. ESI mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker micrOTOF II focus
time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF MS) or a Shimadzu Axima Confidence
MALDI-TOF MS without a matrix. IR spectra were recorded on a Varian
IR-660 apparatus. The absorption is indicated in wave numbers [cm–1]. Elemental analysis (C, H, N), carried out with
a Euro EA 3000 (Euro Vector) machine and an EA 1119 CHNS, CE machine,
is within ±0.50% of the calculated values, confirming a purity
of >95%. Artesunic acid (16) and DHA were obtained
from
ABCR (Karlsruhe, Germany).

4.1.2 General Procedure for
Hybrids 6–8
To the corresponding
quinazoline
alcohol, 11 or 13, in CH3CN (and
anhydrous EtOAc) with 4 Å molecular sieves, DMAP and artesunic
acid (16) or artemisinin-derived acid 17 (prepared according to the literature procedures,47 see Scheme 2) were added consecutively, and the reaction mixture was cooled to
0 °C. Subsequently, DCC was added, and the reaction mixture was
warmed to rt and stirred for 24, 48, or 53 h. Subsequently, DCU was
removed by filtration, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure.
The crude product was purified by column chromatography, and hybrids 6 and 7 were obtained as pale yellow solids and
hybrid 8 as a pale yellow oil.

4.1.6 General Procedure for Hybrids 9 and 10
A solution of artesunic acid (16) or artemisinin-derived acid 17 and HOBt in
dry DMF (2.0 mL) was cooled to 0 °C. EDCI·HCl was added
to the reaction mixture at 0 °C under N2. After stirring
the reaction mixture for 10 min, a solution of quinazoline amine 15 in dry DMF (5.0 mL) and DIPEA were added subsequently at
0 °C under N2. The resulting reaction mixture was
slowly warmed to rt and stirred overnight for 22 h or 3 days. After
this time period, EtOAc (30 mL) and H2O (30 mL) were added.
The two phases were separated, and the water phase was extracted with
EtOAc (3 × 25 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with
H2O (3 × 15 mL) and brine (20 mL), dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure
to give a yellow oil. The crude product was purified by gradient column
chromatography to obtain hybrids 9 and 10 as off-white solids.

4.2 Cytotoxicity Studies against P. falciparum 3D7 Strains
4.2.1 P. falciparum culture
P.
falciparum 3D7
parasites were cultured in type A-positive human erythrocytes at a
hematocrit of 5% in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM
hypoxanthine, 50 μg/mL gentamycin, and 0.5% albumax I. Cultures
were incubated at 37 °C under controlled atmospheric conditions
of 5% O2, 3% CO2, and 92% N2 at 95%
relative humidity.

4.2.2 In Vitro Antimalarial
Activity Assay
Cultures used in cell proliferation assays
were synchronized by sorbitol
treatment.62 Concentrations to inhibit
parasite growth by 50% (EC50) were determined using the
SYBR Green I malaria drug sensitivity assay.63 Aliquots of 100 μL of a cell suspension containing ring stages
at a parasitemia of 0.2% and a hematocrit of 2% were added to the
wells of 96-well microtiter plates. Plates were incubated for 72 h
in the presence of different drug concentrations. Subsequently, cells
of each well were lysed with 100 μL of lysis buffer (40 mM Tris,
pH 7.5, 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetate, 0.02% saponin, 0.08% Triton
X-100) containing 8.3 μM SYBR Green. Plates were incubated for
1 h in the dark at rt under constant mixing before fluorescence (excitation
wavelength 485 nm; emission wavelength >520 nm) was determined
using
a microtiter plate fluorescence reader (Victor X4; Perkin Elmer).
Drugs were serially diluted to 1:3 with the initial drug concentrations
being 243 nM for chloroquine, artesunic acid (16), and
its derivates and 81 nM for DHA and its derivates. Each drug concentration
was examined in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Uninfected
erythrocytes (hematocrit 2%) and infected erythrocytes without the
drug served as controls and were investigated in parallel. Percent
growth was calculated as described by Beez.64 Data were analyzed using the SigmaPlot (version 12.0; Hill function,
three parameters) and Sigma Stat programs.

4.3 HCMV GFP-Based Replication Assay
The HCMV GFP-based
replication assay was carried out over a duration
of 7 days (multiround HCMV infection) with primary HFFs infected with
a GFP-expressing recombinant HCMV (AD169-GFP), as described before.50,52,54,57 All data represent mean values of determinations in quadruplicate
(HCMV infections performed in duplicate, GFP measurements of total
cell lysates performed in duplicate). Processing and evaluation of
data were performed by the use of Excel (means and standard deviations).

4.4 Cytotoxicity Studies against Leukemia Cells
4.4.1 Cell Culture
Human leukemic CCRF-CEM
and the P-glycoprotein expressing CEM/ADR5000 cells were obtained
from the University of Jena (Department for Pediatrics, University
of Jena, Germany) and were cultivated in the RPMI 1640 medium supplemented
with 10% (v/v) inactivated fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere (95%
relative humidity). CEM/ADR5000 cells were treated with 5000 ng/mL
doxorubicin once per week to keep them resistant.65 The multidrug resistance profile of CEM/ADR5000 has been
reported.66,67 Cells were passaged twice a week and used
for experiments in the logarithmic phase.

4.4.2 Cell
Viability Assay
CCRF-CEM or
CEM/ADR5000 cells were seeded at an appropriate density (10 000
cells/well) in a 96-well plate with a total volume of 200 μL.
Compounds were added in varying concentrations [0.001, 0.003, 0.01,
0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 100 μM]. Each concentration was
tested six times within each experiment, and each experiment was repeated
three times. In addition, CEM/ADR5000 cells were tested with doxorubicin
alone and in combination with the three derivatives (10 μM)
and verapamil [0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 100 μM]. After 72 h at
37 °C and 5% CO2, 20 μL of resazurin 0.01% w/v
in ddH2O was added to each well, and there was further
incubation of the plates for 4 h. The plates were measured using an
excitation wavelength of 544 nm and an emission wavelength of 590
nm. The test compound concentrations required to inhibit 50% of cell
proliferation were represented by EC50 values, calculated
from the dose–response curves.
