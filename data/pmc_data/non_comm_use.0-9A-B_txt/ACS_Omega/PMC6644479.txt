The
development of synthetic protocols for biologically important
molecules using biocompatible catalysts in aqueous medium holds the
key in green and sustainable chemistry. Herein, a magnetically recoverable
iron oxide–carbon dot nanocomposite has been demonstrated as
an effective catalyst for cyclooxidative tandem synthesis of quinazolinones
in aqueous medium using alcohols as starting materials. Fluorescent
carbon dots, the newest entrant in the nanocarbon family, were used
as the stabilizing agent for the iron oxide nanoparticles, and a continuous
layer of carbon dots decorates the iron oxide nanoparticle surface
as observed by transmission electron microscopy. The fluorescence
studies demonstrated the effective electron transfer from carbon dots
to the iron oxide nanoparticles resulting in complete quenching of
emission owing to carbon dots, once it binds with iron oxide nanoparticles.
The nanocatalyst showed high activity with significant reusability
for the syntheses of quinazolinones in the presence of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) in an aqueous medium. Controlled experiments
revealed the synergistic effect of carbon dots in enhancing the catalytic
activity of iron oxide, as they might influence the decomposition
of TBHP into radicals owing to their peroxidase activity. These radicals
stabilized over the nanoparticle surface are known to have increased
lifetime compared to solution-based radicals. These surface-stabilized
radicals then could catalyze the tandem reaction resulting in the
formation of the quinazolinone derivatives in high yields.

Introduction
In recent years, there
has been a tremendous emphasis toward developing
greener methodologies in industrial production of fine and commodity
chemicals.1−3 The focal point to attain a clean and sustainable
method has been toward the use of safer solvents, most preferably
water, and the use of nontoxic and recyclable catalyst. Following
these principles, there is a considerable interest toward the development
of transition metal oxide nanocatalysts in cascade organic synthesis.
Amidation of C(sp3)–H bonds leading to N-heterocycles,
similar to quinazolinones, represent an important organic transformation.
The traditional C–H amidation reactions involve several drawbacks,
such as functionalization of starting materials, use of stoichiometric
amounts of metal catalysts, and hazardous solvents. On the other hand,
direct C–H amidation has received substantial interests because
of reduced number of synthetic steps and does not require excessive
catalyst amount.4−8 Quinazolinones have an important motif in several biologically relevant
pharmacophores and exhibit a broad spectrum of activities such as
anticancer, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activity
(Scheme 1a).9−13 The classical method of quinazolinone synthesis involves condensation
of aldehydes and 2-aminobenzamides to give aminal intermediates, which
then undergo oxidation to yield the final quinazolinone product.12,13 However, the use of chemically unstable aldehydes as a starting
material and hazardous oxidants, such as KMnO4, CuCl2, and 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone, are significant
limitations in this method. Another strategy is to use more benign
and readily available alcohols as starting materials.14 The reaction takes place through a two-step oxidation pathway,
where alcohols are first oxidized to aldehydes, followed by coupling
with 2-aminobenzamides forming an aminal derivative and their oxidation
to the final quinazolinone. The catalyst needs to demonstrate high
activity and selectivity as the reaction involves dehydrogenation
of both C–H and N–H bond in one pot. Various homogeneous
and heterogeneous systems including ZnI2,15 homogeneous Ru and Pd catalysts, iron salts,16−19 heterogeneous Pt nanoclusters,20 [Cp*IrCl2]2,21 and organocatalytic
domino strategies22,23 have been developed for quinazolinones.
Although these approaches resulted in an excellent formation of the
product, the reaction involved the use of precious metal catalysts
with high loading, toxic solvents, hazardous byproducts, or complexity
in work-up. Therefore, there has been a great scope for the development
of greener synthetic procedures using easily separable heterogeneous
catalysts using water as the reaction medium. Water is the most acceptable
solvent for sustainable synthetic chemistry because of their natural
abundance, no toxicity as well as reduced work-up simplicity and purification
process.24−29 Keeping all of these points in mind, development of an easily recoverable,
stable, low cost, and heterogeneous catalytic system (Scheme 1b) from earth-abundant metals
for the formation of important compounds such as quinazolinones in
water is highly desirable.

Scheme 1 (a) Selected Examples of Biologically Active
Quinazolinones and (b)
One-Pot Synthesis of Quinazolinones with Alcohols and 2-Aminobenzamides
as the Starting Materials
Low-cost and environmentally friendly Fe3O4 nanocatalysts have demonstrated high efficiency toward several
organic
reactions.30−33 The easy removal and reusability of these magnetic nanoparticles
from the reaction mixture by magnetic separation is an important criterion
for ecological and economical demands. On the other hand, carbon nanodots
(CNDs), the fluorescent tiny form of nanocarbons, have attracted a
wide variety of applications in the technologically relevant areas
such as optoelectronic devices, solar cells, sensing, bioimaging,
and so forth.34−38 The high dispersibility in water, biocompatibility, and photostability
make this material an attractive alternative to the semiconductor
quantum dots for these applications. Further, CNDs demonstrate excellent
peroxidise activities that have been harnessed for biological sensing.39,40 Earlier, we reported the activity of CNDs for the reduction of metal
salts to form metal nanoparticles that were used for catalysis and
sensing applications.41,42 CNDs also demonstrate excellent
carbocatalytic activity for various organic transformations owing
to their inherent acidic and oxidative properties.43,44 The presence of carboxylic functionality on the CND surface makes
them an effective stabilizer for oxide nanoparticles, and cooperative
interactions might influence the activity of the metal oxides as catalysts.
Herein, we demonstrate that CND-stabilized Fe3O4 nanoparticles could be used as an efficient catalytic system for
one-pot tandem reaction leading to quinazolinones from alcohols as
starting materials. Most importantly, the formation of quinazolinones
could be accomplished in an aqueous medium using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as an external oxidant. Recently, nanocrystalline
MnO2 has shown good activity as a heterogeneous catalyst
for the synthesis of quinazolinone in the presence of TBHP;45 however, the reactions were performed using
toxic chlorobenzene as a solvent. CNDs not only function as effective
surface-stabilizing agents for the Fe3O4 nanoparticles
but also contribute to the enhancement of catalytic activity of the
composite through their intrinsic peroxidise activity. Thus, the present
method represents substantial improvements over the earlier reported
methods from green and sustainable chemistry point of view.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization of Catalysts
Toward
the development of the magnetic nanocatalytic system, we first synthesized
−COOH surface-functionalized CNDs by microwave treatment of
polyethylene glycol-200 (PEG-200) in a focused microwave CEM discover
reactor at 150 W and 150 °C for 30 min. The synthesized brown
dispersion demonstrated excitation-dependent emission behavior with
the maximum emission, observed at 490 nm at an excitation wavelength
of 375 nm (Figure 1a).46 Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) also validated the generation of well-dispersed spherical NPs
(Figure 1b) with the
average particle diameter of 3.4 ± 0.7 nm. It is well-known that
caramelization of PEG leads to the formation of carboxyl group-functionalized
surfaces on the carbonaceous structures,47 which can be used as an effective stabilizer for the oxide materials.
Therefore, CNDs were directly used as a passivating agent for iron
oxide nanoparticles. The synthesis of Fe3O4 nanoparticles
was performed using the well-known coprecipitation method using a
mixture of Fe3+ and Fe2+ salts (2:1) in an aqueous
medium using CNDs as stabilizing agents. From the TEM studies, the
formation of spherical Fe3O4 NPs was clearly
evident having an average diameter of 10 ± 0.8 nm (Figure 1c). A wrapping high-contrast
Fe3O4 core was wrapped by a low-contrast continuous
CND layer of thickness ca. 2.6 nm, as observed by high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM), signifying the formation of a core–shell structure
(inset Figure 1c).
The Fe3O4–CND showed high crystallinity
as demonstrated by the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern
(Figure 1d). The effective
coating of CNDs on the Fe3O4 surface was further
evidenced by the quenching of fluorescence owing to CNDs (Figure 1e). It is well-known
that CNDs show high fluorescence selectivity for Fe3+ ions
because of fast electron transfer between Fe3+ and CNDs
surface-passivated with oxygen-rich groups.48 The fluorescence of CNDs quenches because of the resulting nonradiative
electron/hole recombination. Further evidence for the CND binding
to the iron oxide surface was obtained from the Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) studies. The peak intensity of the oxygenated functional
groups of CNDs such as −C=O and C–O–C
(∼1703 and 1101 cm–1) was decreased significantly
in the Fe3O4–CND composite, indicating
the involvement of these groups in surface stabilization. In addition,
a new peak at ∼594 cm–1 corresponding to
Fe–O stretching was also observed (Figure 1f). Scanning electron microscopy image and
energy-dispersive spectroscopic analysis revealed the presence of
C, O, and Fe in the composite material (Figure S1). Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), magnetic susceptibility
measurement, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were performed
to obtain the physicochemical properties of the nanocomposite. PXRD
studies showed the characteristic Bragg’s reflections corresponding
to Fe3O4 along with a broad peak at 2θ
= 23°, reflecting the presence of CNDs (Figure 2a).49,50 Magnetic susceptibility
measurement of Fe3O4–CND composite (Figure 2b) showed a reduced
magnetization value (48.6 emu/g) compared to that of earlier reported
bare Fe3O4 NPs (64 emu/g).51 Moreover, remanence on the magnetization loop, zero coercivity,
and the absence of a hysteresis loop suggested that the Fe3O4–CND composite showed a superparamagnetic behavior.

respectively.

(b) magnetization curve for CND-stabilized

We further performed XPS measurements of the synthesized
nanocomposite.
The XPS survey spectrum of Fe3O4–CND
composite shows major lines at binding energies (BEs) of about 284.6,
530.7, and 710.7–724.6 eV which can be attributed to C 1s,
O 1s, and Fe 2p, respectively (Figure 3a).52 XPS signals appearing
at BEs 710.7 and 724.6 eV corresponding to Fe 2p3/2 and
Fe 2p1/2 levels, respectively, are characteristic peaks
for Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Figure 3b). The C 1s core-level spectrum of Fe3O4–CND composite could be fitted into four
components having BEs at about 284.8, 286.2, 287.9, and 289.0 eV that
can be attributed to the nonoxygenated carbon in C–C, epoxy
carbon in C–O, carbonyl carbon in C=O, and carboxyl
carbon in O–C=O, respectively (Figure 3c). The O 1s core-level spectrum of Fe3O4–CND composite was fitted into three components
with BEs at about 530.7, 532.2, and 533.2 eV, which correspond to
the anionic oxygen in Fe3O4, carbonyl oxygen
in C=O, and alkoxy oxygen in C–O, respectively (Figure 3d).

Cyclooxidative Synthesis of Quinazolinone
An environmentally
friendly methodology for the formation of quinazolinones using a recyclable
and heterogeneous catalyst in aqueous medium is of utmost importance.
The use of alcohols as starting materials represents a more benignant
pathway compared to unstable aldehydes. The catalytic activity of
Fe3O4–CND composite was initially evaluated
by studying the coupling of benzyl alcohol (1a) with 2-aminobenzamide
(2a) as a model reaction in aqueous medium. The use of molecular oxygen
as the terminal oxidant resulted in poor conversion with dihydroquinazolinone
as the major product. On the other hand, the use of TBHP replacing
O2 as the oxidant resulted in high conversion with quinazolinone
as the major product (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 C–H Amidation Leading to Dihydroquinazolinone
and Quinazolinone
With these encouraging results in hand, we optimized the
reaction
conditions to obtain the suitable reaction parameters. In the presence
of nanocatalysts, the reaction resulted in no product formation at
room temperature in an aqueous medium (Table 1, entry 1). However, increasing the reaction
temperature to 90 °C using molecular oxygen as the terminal oxidant
resulted in the desired quinazolinone product with 5% yield. Further,
the use of H2O2 as the oxidant resulted only
in trace amount of quinazolinone formation. Changing the external
oxidant to TBHP (2 equiv) instead of molecular oxygen or H2O2 resulted in a significant enhancement in the reaction
rate and resulted in 94% of quinazolinone (Table 1, entry 4). In a controlled reaction, only
TBHP in the absence of catalyst resulted in 25% of the product (Table 1, entry 5). Further,
the model reaction using CNDs as a catalyst (without Fe3O4) in the presence of TBHP at 90 °C afforded 35%
yield of the desired product (Table 1, entry 7). Reactions with variable catalyst loading
showed that 10 wt % of Fe3O4–CND nanocatalyst
to be optimal for the reaction (Tables 1 and S1). Among the solvents
screened, although toluene gave comparable product yield with that
of water, we chose water as the solvent for our further studies. Increase
in the amount of TBHP to 4 equiv had detrimental effect on the reaction
as lower yield of the product was obtained (Table S1, entry 5). The use of bare Fe3O4 NPs
as the catalyst resulted only in 57% yield of the product (Table 1, entry 10). This
can be attributed to the possible agglomeration of the NPs under thermal
reaction conditions. Further, citrate-stabilized Fe3O4 NPs resulted in 60% yield of quinazolinone under similar
reaction conditions (Table 1, entry 11). An inorganic base, similar to K2CO3, was found to be ineffective for the reaction and resulted
only in trace formation of the product (Table S1, entry 6). Overall, the optimal reaction condition was obtained
using 10 wt % of Fe3O4–CND catalyst in
the presence of TBHP as the oxidant at 90 °C for 16 h in aqueous
medium.

b Yields of isolated product.

Having the optimized reaction conditions
in hand, we evaluated
the substrate scope for the reaction. Various primary alcohols were
used as substrates to react with 2-aminobenzamide (2a), and the results
are summarized in Table 2. A wide range of quinazolinones could be synthesized with good to
excellent yields under the present reaction condition. Benzyl alcohol
bearing electronically activating substituent such as −Me and
−OMe could be coupled with 2-aminobenzamide to give excellent
yield of their corresponding quinazolinone products (82 and 79%, 3ia,
3ja, Table 2), whereas
those with electronically deactivating substituent −NO2 resulted in comparatively lesser yield of the product (76%,
3ea, Table 2). Halo-substituted
benzyl alcohols were also found to be stable under the reaction conditions
and could be introduced in the quinazolinone skeleton with excellent
yields (entry 3ba, 3ha, and 3kb, Table 2). In the case of cinnamyl alcohol, the olefinic C=C
bond survived well under the reaction conditions and resulted in corresponding
quinazolinone with 90% yield (entry 3da, Table 2). Several substituted 2-aminobenzamides
were also found to be compatible under the present reaction conditions
and several primary alcohols with electronically rich/poor/halo substituents
could be converted to the desired products with excellent yields (3ab,
3kb, 3ob, 3pb, 3qb, 3ac, and 3ad, Table 2). Heteroatoms are known to poison the metal
oxide surface by strongly coordinating to the active catalytic site.
However, heterocyclic alcohols such as 2-pyridine carboxaldehyde,
furfural, and 2-thiophenecarboxaldehyde could be efficiently transformed
into the desired products with high yields using the present synthetic
protocol (entry 3ca, 3la, and 3ma, Table 2). Fused ring alcohol could also be transformed
to the desired quinazolinone skeleton with 74% yield (entry 3na, Table 2). Furthermore, inactive
aliphatic alcohols could also be coupled to give the desired product
with reasonably good yields (entry 3fa and 3ga, Table 2).

Table 2 Synthesis of Quinazolinones
Catalyzed
by Fe3O4–CND compositea
a Reaction conditions:
alcohol (1.5
mmol), 2-aminobenzamide (0.5 mmol), 10 wt % Fe3O4–CND, 2.0 equiv TBHP, and 2 mL of water, magnetically stirred
at 900 rpm, 13–20 h at 90 °C.

On the other hand, when benzylamine was allowed to
react with 2-aminobenzamide
under the optimized reaction condition, the corresponding quinazolinone
product was obtained with ∼80% yield; however, several byproducts
were obtained including benzaldehyde, imine, and 2,3-dihydroquinazolinone.
Similarly, when 2-aminobenzylamine was allowed to react with benzyl
alcohol under the same reaction condition, the corresponding quinazoline
product was obtained with 55% yield.

Mechanistic Studies
A few control experiments were
carried out to have an insight into the reaction mechanism (Scheme 3). Reaction of benzaldehyde
and 2-aminobenzamide in the presence Fe3O4–CND
and TBHP yielded quinazolinone as the exclusive product, whereas in
their absence resulted in dihydroquinazolinone as the major product.53,54 The results suggest that benzaldehyde and dihydroquinazolinone could
be the intermediates in the model coupling reaction of benzyl alcohol
and 2-aminobenzamide.

2-Aminobenzamide as Starting
Materials
Further, the reaction
was significantly inhibited when radical
inhibitors such as (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxy and butylated
hydroxytoluene (BHT) were added to the reaction (Schemes 4 and 5). This result indicates that the reaction should follow a free-radical
pathway.55−59

Scheme 5 All Reactions were Carried out Using
0.5 mmol Substrate, 1.0 mmol
TBHP, 0.5 mmol BHT, 10 mg of Catalyst and 2 mL of Water at 90 °C,
Rate in the Unit of 10–5 mol/s
On the basis of these results, we propose a
reaction sequence for
the cyclooxidative tandem reaction of benzyl alcohol and 2-aminobenzamide
(Scheme 5). In the
first step, oxidation of benzyl alcohol resulted in the formation
of benzaldehyde, which reacts with 2-aminobenzamide to generate dihydroquinazolinone
(step 2). Finally, dihydroquinazolinone oxidizes to give the final
product quinazolinone. Oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde
(step 1), which is the rate-determining step, involves free radicals
because the presence of free-radical scavengers such as BHT greatly
reduced the reaction rate. Oxidation of dihydroquinazolinone (step
3) does not involve any radical process as the corresponding reaction
rate was not affected by the presence of BHT.

It is well-reported
that reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived
from TBHP or other peroxides are short-lived in solution, and the
stoichiometric amount of TBHP is usually required to maintain significant
ROS concentration for a longer period.60 However, these ROS can have extended stability on nanoparticle surface
with enhanced lifetime that can facilitate the oxidation reactions.61 In our case, the unprecedented catalytic activity
of the Fe3O4–CND and TBHP system may
be attributed to the rapid decomposition of TBHP to its radicals catalyzed
by Fe3O4–CND and their enhanced stability
on the nanoparticle surface. Further, the enhanced activity of Fe3O4–CND nanocomposite compared to bare or
citrate-stabilized Fe3O4 NPs toward the formation
of quinazolinones could be attributed to the cooperativity between
CND and Fe3O4 NPs, as CNDs are known to have
intrinsic peroxidase activities.

Reusability Studies
The superparamagnetic nature of
Fe3O4–CND permits recovery of the catalyst
from the reaction mixture easily with the help of a simple magnet
without the loss of catalyst mass (Figure 4a). The reusability of the recovered catalyst
was evaluated for the model reaction, and more than 90% of its original
activity was retained even after four cycles (Figure 4b). Morphological studies of Fe3O4–CND recovered after the third cycle of reaction
showed no significant changes in the particle morphology (Figure 4c). On the other
hand, a significant decrease in the catalytic activity was observed
for recovered bare Fe3O4 NPs (34%) or Fe3O4–citrate (43%) because of the loss of
structural integrity even after the first cycle.

dispersion of Fe3O4–CND nanoparticles

magnet, (b) reusability study of Fe3O4–CND
for the model reaction, and (c) TEM image of Fe3O4–CND recovered after the third cycle of reaction.

Further, we performed a leaching test to investigate
the stability
of the nanocomposite during the catalytic reaction (Figure 5). In the leaching test, the
reaction was stopped after 4 h, and the catalyst was removed using
a magnet. The reaction was further continued with the filtrate. However,
after the stipulated time of 16 h, we did not observe any increment
in product formation which clearly suggests that no active species
were leached during the course of the catalytic reaction.

indicating no leaching of active species from the
catalysts during catalytic reaction.

Conclusions
In summary, CND-stabilized magnetic iron
oxide nanoparticle composite
has been demonstrated as an effective catalytic system for a one-pot
cascade quinazolinone synthesis in aqueous medium from alcohols and
2-aminobenzamides in a cyclooxidative pathway in the presence of TBHP.
The rapid decomposition of TBHP into its radicals (ROS) and their
surface stabilization on the nanoparticle account for the exceptional
catalytic activity of the system. Further, the inherent magnetic nature
of the catalytic system renders easy recovery of the catalyst from
the reaction mixture that can be reused with efficient activity over
several cycles. The results demonstrate excellent synergistic effect
of carbon dots with metal oxide nanoparticles that can be harnessed
for important heterogeneous organic transformations.

Experimental
Details
Generation Information
A Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer
with Cu Kα source (0.154 nm wavelength) was used to perform
powder XRD analysis of the nanocatalysts. A JEOL JEM-2100 TEM microscope
(200 kV) was used to obtain morphological analysis. UV–visible
and FTIR measurements were performed by using Varian Cary 10 Bio Spectrophotometer
and Bruker Tensor 27 instrument, respectively. FluoroMax-4p fluorometer
from Horiba (model: FM-100) was used to record the emission spectra.
XPS spectra were obtained from an ESCA instrument, VSW (UK). EverCool
7 T SQUID magnetometer was used to perform magnetic susceptibility
measurements. All NMR analyses (1H and 13C)
were done using Bruker ADVANCE (III) 400 or 100 MHz spectrometer,
respectively. 1H NMR assignment data are reported using
the format chemical shift (δ ppm), multiplicity [singlet (s),
doublet (d), triplet (t), and multiplet (m)], coupling constant (J
Hz), and integration value. For 13C NMR, only a chemical
shift value is reported. ESI-TOF-MS was used to record high-resolution
mass spectra.

Materials and Methods
PEG-200, used
as a carbon source
to synthesize CNDs, was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Iron sulfate, iron
chloride, and sodium hydroxide were purchased from Merck, India. TBHP,
hydrogen peroxide, and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and Merck India and used without further purification. We used Millipore
water (ultrapure level) throughout the experiments.

Synthesis of
Carbon Nanodots
In a typical method, 15
mL of PEG-200 in a sealed glass tube was subjected to microwave irradiation
(focused microwave CEM discover reactor) at 150 W and 150 °C
for 30 min. The colorless liquid turned into brown upon microwave
treatment. The brown mixture was then diluted with 50 mL of water
and dialyzed using a dialysis membrane (molecular cutoff of 10 kDa)
for 48 h to remove unreacted materials. The CND containing solution
was further centrifuged at 22 000 rpm and washed with water
for several times. Finally, the carbon dots were redispersed in water
to make a concentration of 0.5 mg mL–1 and used
for further experiments.

Synthesis of Fe3O4–CND
Nanocomposite
The synthesized CND solution (50 mL) was used
as a reaction medium
for the synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles. Iron sulfate (2.0 mmol;
0.556 g) and iron chloride (4.0 mmol; 0.648 g) were added to a three-neck
round-bottom flask containing CND solution. The flask containing the
mixture was put on a magnetic stirrer and heated to 60 °C keeping
the solution stirred. Any air (oxygen) present inside the flask was
removed using a vacuum pump, and the flask was filled with inert nitrogen
gas. To ensure complete removal of oxygen, we purged nitrogen gas
three times into the flask and removed them using a vacuum pump. After
10 min, 20 mL of 2.5 M NaOH solution was added to the mixture using
a syringe. This changed the solution color from brown to black, indicating
the formation of iron oxide nanoparticles. After 12 h, the reaction
was stopped and cooled. Iron oxide nanoparticles stabilized with CNDs
settled on the bottom of the flask. The supernatant liquid was removed,
and the catalyst was purified by washing with Milli-Q water and ethanol.

Cyclooxidative Synthesis of Quinazolinones
In a Teflon-sealed
glass tube, 1.5 mmol alcohol, 0.5 mmol 2-aminobenzamide, 193 μL
of TBHP, 25 mg of Fe3O4–CND, and 2 mL
of H2O were taken, and the mixture was heated at 90 °C
in an oil bath under magnetic stirring for 13–20 h. The progress
of the reaction was monitored by thin-layer chromatography. After
completion of the reaction, the reaction was cooled to room temperature,
and the catalyst was removed by using a magnet. The resulting mixture
was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 20 mL) and successively
washed with water (1 × 15 mL). The organic solution was dried
over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent was evaporated using
a rotary evaporator to get the crude reaction mixture. Further, the
pure product was obtained by purifying the mixture on silica gel column
chromatography (100–200 mesh) using hexane and ethyl acetate
as the eluents.
