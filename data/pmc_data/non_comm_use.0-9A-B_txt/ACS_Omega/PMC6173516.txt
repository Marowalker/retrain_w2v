Four ammonium-based
ionic liquids were synthesized for the selective
extraction and degradation of lignin from coffee husk. The extracted
lignin samples were characterized by Fourier transform infrared, gel
permeation chromatography, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry,
UV–vis, 1H and 13C NMR, heteronuclear

and field emission scanning electron microscopy analyses. The analyzed
results confirmed that these ionic liquids are able to effectively
extract and decompose the lignin to smaller molecules from the biomass.
Experimental results show that a significantly high yield, 71.2% of
the original lignin, has been achieved. This processing method is
an efficient, economical, and environmentally friendly green route
for producing high-added-value lignin from wasted coffee husk.

1 Introduction
A huge
amount of coffee husk (CH), as waste materials, is produced
after the refining of coffee beans. The management of such unwanted
waste materials remains a challenging task. In general practice, those
waste materials are either burned and released to the atmosphere or
dumped in field. However, both ways create a serious threat to the
environment. Therefore, developing a green method to extract lignin
from the enormously available coffee husk not only helps us to overcome
this environmental problem but also enhances the added value of those
waste materials.

Basically, lignin is an amorphous polymer with
highly cross-linking
network.1 It is known to possess various
functional groups, reactive sites, and high content of guaiacyl, syringyl,
and p-hydroxyphenyl chemical units.2 Various applications of lignin are well recognized, such
as an additive to composite materials,3 antioxidants,4 adsorbents,5 sorption of heavy-metal ions,6 anticancer agents,7 and dyes.
The wide applications of lignin emanate from its substantial amount
of functional groups and reactive sites presented in the molecule
irrespective of its plant sources.2 Despite
its direct use in various emerging fields of science and engineering,
depolymerization of lignin to lower-molecular-weight phenolic compounds
and oligomers has been recognized as a highly potential method to
fulfill our future demands of valuable chemicals.8 Therefore, extracting lignin and simultaneously converting
into high-added-value compounds from the nonedible and enormously
available biomass, such as coffee husk, is economically and environmentally
attractive for practical applications.

Several methods, such
as alkali treatment,9 acid treatment,10 organic solvents treatment,11 and use of sub- or supercritical technology,12 have been proposed to extract lignin from lignocellulosic
biomass. In the development of lignin extraction process from lignocellulosic
biomass, the major concerns are to find the source of lignin, which
possesses negligible economical values, to find a suitable solvent
to dissolve and decompose biomass, and to design a process with low
energy consumption and less complexity. The process of lignin recovery
from biomass generally includes pretreatment, dissolution, extraction,
and finally depolymerization. Although various conventional solvents
are found to be highly promising in recovering major valuable components
and reducing the energy requirement, green credential of the process
remains doubtful.13 For example, Zhang
et al.14 reported that the extraction of
lignin by using mineral acid is highly advantageous in the expectations
of reducing energy consumption and gaining high yield of valuable
compounds. However, due to the hazardous nature of the mineral acid,
the process is harmful to the environment, as well as the recycling
and reusing of acid is not economical.

Finding a suitable green
solvent for the pretreatment and dissolution
of biomass is essentially needed. Recently, ionic liquids (ILs), as
a new class of green solvents, have been found to be suitable for
the dissolution of biomass.15 ILs are mainly
composed of cations (generally organic) and anions (organic or inorganic).
They are known to possess very interesting physiochemical properties
over conventional solvents, such as high solvation ability for a range
of molecules, comparatively less flammable nature, high ionic conductivity,
and wide electrochemical window.16 Especially,
due to their nonvolatile nature and high chemical and thermal stabilities,
they are referred to as green media.17 Thus,
in comparison to the conventional volatile organic solvents and the
hazardous mineral acids or alkaline solutions, the process using ILs
is considered as a green route for the biomass utilization.

The extraction of lignin from biomass in imidazolium-based IL has
been studied by many researchers.18−20 For instance, Lan et
al.18 investigated the fractionation process
of the sugarcane bagasse in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride and
reported that 10.51 wt % of lignin can be extracted. They concluded
that the ionic liquid disrupts the lignin cellulose or hemicellulose
structural network and fractionates the biomass into its constituent
components of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose. The extraction
of lignin from wood sources (Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus globulus) by using
a series of imidazolium-based ILs accompanying with microwave treatment
was also reported.19 Those ILs included
1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate,
1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
chloride, and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride. All of the investigated
ionic liquids are found to dissolve lignocellulosic biomass with an
aid of microwave irradiation, and lignin was precipitated by using
methanol as an antisolvent. Some other studies by using imidazolium-based
ILs are also available in the literature.20 Those studies focused on optimizing the processing parameters to
increase the overall yield of lignin and its valuable components.

In this work, we attempt to develop a green method to extract waste
coffee husk and simultaneously depolymerize the extracted lignin into
high-added-value compounds. The main objective of this work is to
evaluate several potential ammonium-based ILs for the extraction and
depolymerization of lignin from coffee husk. The selected ionic liquids
are diisopropylethylammonium acetate ([DIPEA][Ac]), diisopropylethylammonium
propanoate ([DIPEA][P]), diisopropylethylammonium octanoate ([DIPEA][O]),
and diisopropylethylammonium benzoate ([DIPEA][B]). In our previous
work,21 we have successfully demonstrated
the suitability of the ammonium-based ionic liquids in the selective
degradation of the alkali lignin (AL). The extracted lignin is characterized
by means of spectroscopic and chromatographic approaches, including
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography
(GPC), ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–vis), 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy,
heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC)-NMR spectroscopy, and
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Material characterization techniques,
such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), are
also used to characterize untreated and treated coffee husk biomass.
Further, systematic studies are made to explore the effect of increasing
hydrophobicity, the effect of aromatic anion over aliphatic anion,
and the effects of operational parameters (temperature T, and reaction time t) on the performance of extraction
and depolymerization of lignin from coffee husk.

2 Results
and Discussion
In this study, we aim to develop a green route
to produce valuable
chemicals using waste coffee husk as a feedstock. For this purpose,
we performed a detailed study to extract the lignin content of the
coffee husk with three ionic liquids containing ammonium ion as cation
and aliphatic anions with varying alkyl chain as anions ([DIPEA][Ac],
[DIPEA][O], and [DIPEA][P]) at 80, 100, and 120 °C, respectively.
The extracted lignin samples are characterized by using a series of
spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques. The favorable reaction
conditions of temperature and treatment time for dissolution of coffee
husk in ammonium-based ionic liquid are found as 120 °C and 4
h, respectively. Further, to compare the efficiency of the ionic liquids
containing ammonium ion as cation and aliphatic anion as anion to
that of the ionic liquid containing common ammonium ion as cation
and aromatic ion as anion, a study was performed in the presence of
[DIPEA][B] only at favorable reaction conditions (120 °C and
4 h). The obtained results are discussed in the subsequent sections.

2.1 Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy
For
the structural elucidation of lignin extracted from coffee
husk by the ionic liquids at different extraction temperatures, the
extracted solutions were analyzed by FT-IR spectroscopy. Figure 1 presents the FT-IR
spectra for lignin extracted by four ionic liquids: [DIPEA][Ac], [DIPEA][B],
[DIPEA][O], and [DIPEA][P] at 80, 100, and 120 °C, and all of
the patterns of the spectra appear to be almost identical.

of lignin extracted from coffee husk by (a) [DIPEA][Ac],
(b) [DIPEA][P], (c) [DIPEA][O], and (d) [DIPEA][B].

Typical lignin peaks, such as O–H stretching
(3341–3374
cm–1),22 C–H stretching
in methylene groups (2914–2978 cm–1),23 aromatic skeletal vibrations (1552–1574
cm–1), and aromatic C–H in-plane deformation
(1274–1174 cm–1),24 are visible in all extracted lignin spectra. The wavenumbers of
the major peaks are presented in Table 1.

The explained absorption
moieties were also detected in the extracted
lignin from another woody biomass.25 It
is also reported that the spectral peak at 1600–1400 cm–1 is the vibration band of the aromatic ring,26 which is also evident from the peak assigned
in the current study. Besides the spectral peaks explained in the
above sections, an absorption band around 1330 cm–1 was also found, which belongs to the condensed syringyl and guaiacyl
units.27

2.2 UV Spectroscopic
Analysis
The samples
of lignin extracted by different ionic liquids were also characterized
by UV–vis spectroscopy technique. Figure 2a–d shows that lignin extracted by
the ILs had different local maximum intensities of wavelength. For
[DIPEA][Ac]-extracted lignin, the maxima of the peak shifted from
271 to 262 nm as the extraction temperature changed from 80 to 120
°C, indicating that the extracted compounds are getting smaller
molecular weight with increasing temperature. The local maximum intensity
of lignin extracted by [DIPEA][B] at 120 °C occurs at 303 nm,
but the maximum intensities of lignin samples extracted by [DIPEA][Ac],
[DIPEA][O], and [DIPEA][P] in this study are found to be at lower
wavelengths in the same extraction conditions. It means that the lignin
extracted by the ILs derived from aliphatic anions have lower molecular
weight than that extracted by the ILs derived from aromatic anion
under the same experimental conditions.

Figure 2 UV spectra of coffee
husk lignin extracted by (a) [DIPEA][Ac],
(b) [DIPEA][P], (c) [DIPEA][O], and (d) [DIPEA][B].

It is worth mentioning that the UV analysis provides
strong evidence
for the existence of phenolic aromatic compounds in the sample solutions.28 The positions of the peaks on the UV spectra
determine qualitatively the nature of the compounds. Wu et al.25 reported that lignin could absorb in different
ranges, depending on whether the phenolic groups are condensed or
noncondensed to aromatic ring, which may vary with the source and
techniques used.

In the same manner, compounds having higher
molecular weight show
adsorption peak at longer wavelengths than those having lower molecular
weight. In the current study, the absorption peaks of lignin extracted
are found in the range of 245–303 nm for the samples taken
from the experimental runs at 80–120 °C for 4 h. On the
basis of the experimental results, the relative order of molecular
weights of lignin extracted from coffee husk with different ionic
liquids can be found. Under the same experimental conditions, the
order of the averaged molecular weights of the lignin extracted follows
the sequence [DIPEA][Ac] < [DIPEA][P] < [DIPEA][O] < [DIPEA][B],
according to the position of peaks of the lignin samples by wavelength.

Liu et al.29 reported that lignin shows
a maximum adsorption peak near 280 nm, which is good agreement with
the results obtained from the ionic liquid-extracted lignin in the
present study. The presence of the phenolic aromatic ring is also
noted during the functional group analysis by FT-IR spectra.

2.3 Molar Mass Distribution of the Ionic Liquids-Extracted
Lignin
The molecular weight distributions of the lignin extracted
from coffee husk by the ionic liquids are presented in Figure 3a–d. The average molecular
weights (Mw and Mn) and polydispersity indices (PDIs) of [DIPEA][Ac], [DIPEA][B],
[DIPEA][O], and [DIPEA][P] IL-extracted lignin were determined by
gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis, and the results are
depicted in Table 1. A higher value of average molecular weights is observed from the
extracted lignin at lower temperatures. At higher temperatures, the
presence of the lower average molecular weight indicates that in addition
to the fractionation of the coffee husk to respective components of
biomass (lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose), the extracted lignin
was degraded to its monomers and oligomers.

Figure 3 GPC curves of coffee
husk lignin extracted by (a) [DIPEA][Ac],
(b) [DIPEA][P], (c) [DIPEA][O], and (d) [DIPEA][B].

For further confirmation of the degradation of
lignin to lower-molecular-weight
phenolic compounds, [DIPEA][Ac]-extracted solution at 120 °C
for 4 h reaction was taken and the methanol-soluble portion (i.e.,
the major compounds obtained from the depolymerization of lignin)
was analyzed with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS).
The results of GC–MS analysis confirm that value-added chemicals
were produced by treating the coffee husk with the ILs. The compounds
in the product are identified from their mass spectra, which are benzeneacetic
acid, 4-[(trimethylsilyl)oxy]-trimethylsilyl ester, N-benzyl-N-ethyl-p-isopropylbenzamide,
and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). This result is consistent with the
results from GPC and UV–visible analyses. Chinnappan and Kim22 have also found similar fragmentation of the
lignin product after extracting lignin from poplar wood by ionic liquids.
The polydispersity indices (PDIs) of each ionic liquid-extracted lignin
at 80, 100, and 120 °C were calculated. The values are in the
range of 1.00–1.20 (as given in Table 2).

In comparison to the aromatic anion-derived
ionic liquids, the
ionic liquids with shorter chains of the aliphatic anion produce lower
molecular weight of lignin extracted. It indicates that the aliphatic
anions have stronger interaction with the biomass than the aromatic
anions, having the same cation source. In this work, the acids used
as the anion source for the synthesis of the ionic liquids are acetic
acid, propanoic acid, octanoic acid, and benzoic acid. Besides the
extraction of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin from coffee husk,
the aliphatic acids-derived ionic liquids facilitate the degradation
of the extracted lignin. The retention time of the molecular weight
distribution of the [DIPEA][B]-extracted lignin appears to be shorter
than that of the lignin extracted by the other ionic liquids. This
reveals that the lignin extracted with [DIPEA][B] has comparatively
less interactions with respective ionic liquid and thus possesses
a lower extent of degradation, which leads to lignin with higher average
molecular weight. As the chain length of the anion of aliphatic groups
increases, the average molecular weight of the lignin extracted also
increases. This result is in good agreement with the investigation
by UV–visible spectroscopy. This further confirms that the
ionic liquids with shorter-carbon chains give the lower molecular
weight of lignin extracted.

2.4 Thermogravimetric Analysis
(TGA)
TGA under nitrogen environment is one of the crucial
techniques for
the study of thermal stability and decomposition of lignocellulosic
biomass.30 To determine the thermal stability
of lignin extracted from coffee husk by the ionic liquids, TGA study
was conducted. Structurally, lignin is composed of phenylpropanoids
connected with various ether bonds and carbon–carbon bonds
mostly by β-O-4, with these chemical bonds leading to a wide
range of degradation temperature from 100 to 800 °C. [DIPEA][Ac]-extracted
coffee husk and commercial alkali lignin were taken and subjected
to TGA analysis for comparison. After TGA runs, 28% of ionic liquid-extracted
lignin and 48% of alkali lignin still remained unvolatized at 800
°C due to the formation of highly condensed aromatic structures,
which have the ability to form char, as presented in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Thermal decomposition
profiles of alkali lignin (AL) and extracted
lignin using [DIPEA][Ac] (ILL) at 120 °C after 4 h treatment.

Degradation of the lignin samples
can be divided into three stages.
The range of temperature and the weight loss percent in each stage
are presented in Table 3 for both types of lignin. In stage I, the evaporation of absorbed
moisture occurred. Decomposition of carbohydrates presented in the
lignin to volatile gases, such as CO, H2, CO2, and CH4, is expected to occur at phase II.31

phase II	190–340	35	220–390	24	
phase III	above 340	24	above 390	15	
The thermogravimetric analysis of wood species was
conducted by
Poletto et al.,30 who reported that lignin
degradation occurs between 250 and 500 °C. The last phase covers
a wide range of temperature, in which cracking of hydroxyl groups
and volatile compounds derived from lignin are supposed to be removed.32 It is also reported that the source of lignin
determines its thermal property. The lignin extracted from coffee
husk has lower thermal stability (with char yield of 28%) than alkali
lignin (with char yield of 48%).

2.5 X-ray
Diffraction (XRD)
Evidences
related to crystallinity or amorphousness of materials are obtained
by XRD analysis.33,34 The XRD patterns of the coffee
husk, the ionic liquid ([DIPEA][Ac])-extracted lignin, the residue (R) (cellulose and hemicellulose),
and the alkali lignin are presented in Figure 5. The coffee husk has diffraction angles
at 2θ = 16.7, 22.1, and 35.2°. After ionic liquid treatment
at 120 °C for 4 h, the position of diffraction angles are retained
and the broadness decreases (strength of the signal increases) in
the residue isolated. However, the diffraction angles at 2θ
= 16.7 and 35.2° were diminished after separating the cellulose
and hemicellulose, which is an evidence for the absence carbohydrates
in the lignin detached (confirmation for the effective extraction
of lignin by the ionic liquid from the biomass). The increased strength
of the signal of the residue further confirms the crystallinity of
the material (property of cellulose).

Figure 5 XRD patterns of coffee husk (CH), residue
(R), ionic liquid-extracted
lignin (ILL), and alkali lignin (AL).

The ionic liquid-extracted lignin (ILL) has a diffraction
angle
at 2θ = 22.1°, while the commercial alkali lignin (AL)
at 2θ = 19.6°; this variation could be due to the source
and type of the lignin. The signal of the diffraction angle of ILL
becomes weaker and broader than that of coffee husk, which shows more
amorphousness of the polymer. Goudarzi et al.34 reported that the diffraction angle of lignin from biomass is diverse
due to different sources yielding various types of lignin. Generally,
the treatment of the raw coffee husk with the studied ionic liquids
can directly fractionate the biomass to lignin and carbohydrate effectively.

2.6 Morphological Analysis (FESEM)
The
morphologies of the untreated coffee husk, the ionic liquid-extracted
lignin, and the carbohydrate-enriched materials (cellulose and hemicellulose)
were analyzed by FESEM to investigate the change of morphology of
the materials before and after processing. As seen from Figure S1 in the Supporting Information, the
FESEM images show the differences in morphology of the original coffee
husk, the ionic liquid ([DIPEA][Ac])-extracted lignin, and the carbohydrate-enriched
materials separated from the biomass. The untreated coffee husk has
a smooth surface with cracks. Before any chemical modification, the
surface of the coffee husk has wax and other components of biomass
like pectin, lignin, and hemicellulose, which cover the cellulose
within and providing protection against external environmental stresses.

After treatment with ionic liquids at 80, 100, and 120 °C,
the interaction of the biomass with the ionic liquid and the exposure
of bundles of cellulose fiber facilitate the extraction of lignin.
From these images, it can be observed that the lignin fraction morphology
is composed of a smaller irregular shape, as well as exhibits a porous
surface and distorted structure. The morphology of carbohydrate-enriched
materials has crystalline properties. It appears that carbohydrate-enriched
materials show interconnected porous structure. Li et al.35 studied the two-step treatment with ionic liquids
and alkali for enhancing enzymatic hydrolysis of Eucalyptus: chemical
and anatomical changes. They found that the morphology of the cell
walls faced disruptions such as disorder and distortion, which are
observed when pretreated with [Bmim][OAc] and [Emim][OAc]. Another
study was also conducted with an efficient process for pretreatment
of corn stalk in functional ionic liquids.36 They found the compact ordered and rigid fibril structure from untreated
corn stalk, and the structure became disordered after pretreatment
of the lignocellulose.37 According to their
finding, the loose structure after pretreatment with ionic liquids
is probably due to the removal of lignin and decrease of cellulose
crystallinity. The current study is also in good agreement with the
previous reported morphologies of biomass before and after treatment
with ionic liquids.

2.7 1H and 13C NMR Spectra
For further confirmation of the chemical
structure of lignin extracted
from coffee husk, 1H, 13C, and two-dimensional
(2D) NMR spectroscopy studies are conducted. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra are presented in Figure 6. As can be seen from Figure 6a, in the aromatic region of the spectra,
the presence of G and S units is noted by the chemical shift at 6–8
ppm on proton NMR.25,38 Specifically, the integral peak
located at 6.8 ppm is assigned to be aromatic protons in guaiacylpropane
structure. The spectral peak that occurs at 0.95–1.2 ppm belongs
to an aliphatic compound moiety.38 The
spectra 2.1–2.2 ppm arise from methyl protons adjacent to the
double bond. A sharp signal at 2.5 ppm relates to the protons in DMSO.
The peak at 4.78 ppm comes from the Hβ of β-O-4
structures. The presence of characteristic chemical bonds such as
C–C, C–O, and C=C was noted via analysis of hydrogens
located at and/or near the atoms for samples under investigation.

Figure 6 1H NMR (a) and 13C NMR (b) spectra of lignin
fraction extracted by IL at 120 °C after 4 h treatment.

In addition to the proton NMR
spectrum, the 13C NMR
spectrum gives more information concerning the syringyl, guaiacyl,
and p-hydroxyphenyl aromatic carbons, as they are
located in the range of 104.5–166.6 ppm.39 The 13C NMR spectrum in Figure 6b at 111 ppm of chemical shift shows a guaiacyl
unit,40 and the spectral peaks at 126.7–129.7
ppm represent condensed aromatic compounds.41 In most cases, the oxygenated carbon of aromatic compounds shows
a peak around 140–154 ppm, which is currently absent in the
coffee husk lignin characterized. Besides the aromatic compounds’
chemical shift noted in the 13C NMR spectrum of coffee
husk lignin, the characteristic peak is observed at 73 ppm, which
is Cα in β-O-4. In most chemical structures of lignin
extracted from various biomasses, β-O-4 linkage is the common
and the highest in occurrence.25 The aliphatic
C–O on the lignin propyl side chain is noted at 24–26.8
and 29.1 ppm for Cα- and Cβ-methylene groups, respectively.

To further investigate the structural features of lignin extracted
from the coffee husk, the sample was subjected to 2D HSQC NMR analysis.
From the results of 2D HSQC analysis, as shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information, an aromatic region
at δC/δH of 111–130/6.0–8.0
ppm and the aliphatic region at δC/δH of 24–73/0.9–5.8 ppm of an organic compound were observed.42 Both aliphatic and aromatic moieties are observed
from the HSQC NMR spectrum of the isolated lignin by [DIPEA][Ac].
In the aromatic regions, the spectrum at δC/δH 127.0/6.7 ppm is attributed to the C2–H2, and Cα/β–Hα/β of the stilbenes
units are noted. In this region, δC/δH of 131/6.9 ppm spectral peak occurs, which is a characteristic signal
of the p-hydroxylphenyl unit for a carbon position
at δC/δH of C2,6–H2,6.43 The presence of cinnamyl
alcohol end groups is also revealed around the spectral peak at δC/δH of 128/6.8 ppm. Besides the aromatic
groups, methoxy group on the ring is observed at δC/δH 57/3.5.44 Zikeli
et al.45 reported that in the aliphatic
region of HSQC, the presence of a peak of δC/δH at 50–90/2.5–5.8 ppm is an indication for β-O-4
linkage. In the same manner, the spectral peak is observed for δC/δH at 57/3.5 ppm, which is in good agreement
with the previous piloted studies.

A recent study showed that
the NMR spectra (1H, 13C and 2D HSQC) approved
the characteristic structural features
of lignin extracted from other biomasses, which is also noted in lignin
extracted from the coffee husk. Structurally, lignin is composed of
three phenylpropanoids interlinked via the C–O linkage of α-
and β-ether bonds.46 It is reported
that β-O-4 is the dominant one and covers half of the total
chemical bonds used to link each monomer, and the value varies from
biomass to biomass.47 This chemical bond
is also noted in the current work, and the result is in good agreement
with the previous report. In their monomeric form, these compounds
may include p-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol,
and sinapyl alcohol. But these monomers, linked through chemical bonds,
produce p-hydroxyphenyl, guaiacyl, and syringyl residues
from the polymer.1 The presence of these
monomeric units of lignin polymer extracted from coffee husk is also
confirmed by the structural analysis conducted in this work.

2.8 Quantification of Lignin Extracted by ILs
The acid-insoluble
lignin content in the original coffee husk was
determined using a scaled down TAPPI 222 procedure,48 and the value is found to be 28.4% on mass basis. The percentages
of the original lignin extracted (yields) by various ionic liquids
at different temperatures after 4 h treatment are presented in Table 4. Accordingly, the
yield of the extraction and degradation processes for each IL at each
temperature is shown in Figure 7. The coffee husk volatile solids and ash content (on mass
basis) are also determined and found to be 92.3 and 7.7%, respectively.

a Yield = mass percentage of the extracted
lignin from coffee husk/28.4%.

We have investigated ammonium-based ionic liquids for the dissolution
of coffee husk with cleaner process and eco-friendliness. During treatment
of biomass by ILs, the structure of the IL plays a great role. In
the current work, we have subjected four ionic liquids to extract
lignin from coffee husk and the results show a wide variation under
similar condition. Since the ILs used are derived from the same cation
with varying anions, the solubility seems to be strongly affected
by the choice of anion, although temperature of reaction is also a
determinant factor. It is reported that at lower temperatures or at
room temperature, some anions such as trifluoromethanesulfonate (triflate,
[OTf]−), methyl sulfate ([MeSO4]−), chloride, bromide, and acetate are assigned as inhibitors
of lignin dissolution.49 But at higher
extraction temperatures, the yield of the ionic liquid to isolate
lignin increases.

As can be observed in Figure 7, as the length of the carbon chain of anion
increases,
the yield of biomass extraction decreases. The anions incorporated
for the extraction of lignin in the present study are acetate, propanoate,
octanoate, and benzoate. In the present work, using [DIPE][Ac] for
extraction at 120 °C for 4 h, 71.2% of original lignin is extracted
from coffee husk. By increasing the number of carbon of the anion
by one, the yield decreases by 7.5%. Furthermore, by increasing the
chain length from acetate to octanoate, the yield drops by 17%. This
indicates that with the increase of the chain length or decrease of
the acidity of the aliphatic anion, the dissolution of coffee husk
as well as yield of the extracted lignin decreases. A similar effect
of acidity has been reported in the literature,50 and it is well known that the acidity of the ionic liquid
used for biomass treatment has a direct relationship with the progress
of the process. Additionally, by reducing the extraction temperature
from 120 to 80 °C at the same time interval for acetate-derived
ionic liquids, the yield decreased by 46.9%. These show that besides
the nature of anions of the ionic liquids applied, temperature also
plays a vital role in the biomass extraction and degradation.

3 Conclusions
This study shows that ammonium-based ionic
liquids, [DIPEA][Ac],
[DIPEA][P], [DIPEA][O], and [DIPEA][B], can be used not only for dissolving
the coffee husk, but also for extracting and degradating its lignin
content under mild conditions. The structure of ionic liquids and
temperature are found to be the crucial factors for the performance
of the extraction–degradation process. Decrease of the hydrophobicity
of anion and increase of extraction temperature will promote the yield
of the lignin extraction. The highest yield, 71.2%, is achieved as
the coffee husk is treated with [DIPEA][Ac] at 120 °C for 4 h.
Moreover, the extracted lignin has been characterized by FT-IR, GPC,
GC–MS, UV–vis, 1H and 13C NMR,
HSQC NMR, TGA, XRD, and FESEM techniques. Value-added compounds can
be obtained from the waste coffee husk by using the proposed ammonium-based
ionic liquids, especially [DIPEA][Ac].

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Materials
Coffee husk was collected
from Mettu town, Oromia National Regional State, Ethiopia, and transported
to Taipei, Taiwan. Octanoic acid, acetic acid, benzoic acid, propanoic
acid, methanol, methyl sulfoxide-d6, and
sodium nitrate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Diisopropylethylamine
and acetone were supplied by Acros Organics and sulfuric acid by Shimakyu
(Japan). All of these commercial chemicals are analytical reagents
and used without further purification. Double-distilled deionized
water was prepared by the Nanopure-Ultrapure water system with a resistivity
of 18.3 MΩ cm. The ionic liquids, [DIPEA][Ac], [DIPEA][P], [DIPEA][O],
and [DIPEA][B], used in this study were synthesized in our laboratory
according to the method reported in our previous paper.21 The structures of these selected ionic liquids
are presented in Figure 8.

4.2 Lignin Extraction from Coffee Husk
The coffee husk was ground into powder using an electric lab mill
for 1 min. The husk was ground and classified with a series of brass
sieves (40–80 mesh) and then dried overnight in an oven at
60 °C. In the extraction process, 0.50 g of bagasse was added
to 10 g of IL in a 50 mL glass equilibrium cell and a magnetic stirrer
was used to promote the mixing. The cell was connected to a thermostatic
circulator (Fisher Scientific International, Inc.), which was adjusted
to a desired temperature. The extraction (or reaction) time was tested
from 1 to 4 h time intervals at 120 °C. The mixture in the cell
became homogeneous when the extraction time is as long as 4 h and
thus it was taken as the reaction time for the whole study. To investigate
the temperature effect on the yield of lignin extraction from coffee
husk, the experiments were conducted at 80, 100, and 120 °C,
respectively, for 4 h.

4.3 Product Separation and
Characterization
To separate different classes of compounds
from the product mixture,
the bagasse/IL solution was poured into a 250 mL beaker containing
100 mL of acetone/water (1:1 v/v). The beaker was sealed with Parafilm,
and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The precipitated
cellulose-rich materials were separated by filtration and washing
through a ceramic funnel with nylon filter paper on a Buchner flask
under soft vacuum. Then, acetone and water were removed from lignin/IL
by a rotary concentrator under reduced pressure. Finally, the lignin
was isolated from IL by dialysis using distilled water for 3 days
with water exchanged at 8 h interval. The separated lignin sample
was analyzed with various analytical techniques for characterization.

The samples of IL-extracted lignin at different reaction temperatures
were collected, and the FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet FTIR-iS10
spectrometer in the range of 4000–650 cm–1 IR region at a spectral resolution of 8 cm–1 and
200 scans. The IR spectra were collected and analyzed by the spectroscopic
software Varian 4.10. Absorption spectra for the samples of ionic
liquid-extracted lignin at various extraction temperatures were measured
at room temperature by using a UV–visible spectrophotometer
(JASCO, V-550, Japan) equipped with a 1.0 cm quartz cell. The operating
conditions were scan speed, 100 nm min–1; scan range,
200–400 nm; slit width, 2 nm; and l = 0.1
nm. The samples for UV–visible analysis were prepared by diluting
the IL-extracted lignin in ethanol.

The molecular weight distribution
of the extracted lignin was also
measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The mobile phase
and sample solutions were microfiltered with a 0.2 μm membrane
filter and degassed. The sample solution (2 mg mL–1) was prepared in degassed distilled water and injected into the
GPC (aqueous phase, Waters 1525 HPLC pump, 2489 UV detector; aqueous
phase, Waters column 3: WATO-11520 (7.8 × 300 mm), WATO-11530
(7.8 × 300 mm), WATO-11545 (7.8 × 300 mm)). Aqueous solution
of 0.05 M NaNO3 was used as the mobile phase at a flow
rate of 0.5 mL min–1. The calibration curve was
prepared by using Pullulan as a standard.

The MS fraction of
methanol-soluble products was identified by
GC–MS (HP model 6890 series GC system and 5973 mass selective
detector) with an Agilent, DB-5MS capillary column (J&W Scientific,
Inc.; length 30 m × I.D. 0.25 mm). The temperature program was
523–573 K with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1. Helium served as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1.0 mL min–1. The National Institute of Standards and Technology
library of mass spectroscopy was used for identification of the compounds.
The 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HSQC spectra of the
IL-extracted lignin in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6), after treatment at 120 °C for 4 h,
were measured by using a Bruker-Biospin 500 MHz instrument. Each NMR
spectrum was recorded by using tetramethylsilane as an internal standard
and with an average of 120 scans.

The thermal profiles of the
extracted lignin were measured by TGA
(Pyris Diamond TG-DTA). During TGA measurement, the weighted sample
of about 10 mg was heated from 40 to 800 °C at a heating rate
of 10 °C min–1, under a dry nitrogen atmosphere.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements for coffee husk, commercial alkali
lignin, IL-extracted lignin, and carbohydrate residue were made using
Bruker D2-phaser diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source
(λ = 1.54056 Å), scanning between 10 and 60° (2θ)
at a scan rate of 2° min–1 in steps of 0.02°.
The morphologies of the coffee husk, [DIPEA][Ac]-extracted lignin,
and carbohydrate residue were examined by field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM 6500F, JEOL) and field emission transmission
electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-2100) coupled with energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy, which was used to determine the elemental content.

The lignin content in the original coffee husk was determined by
the TAPPI method with a scale down process. Approximately 2.5 g of
dried bagasse was placed in a 50 mL vial, and 25 mL of 72% H2SO4 aqueous solution was added. The mixture was stirred
at room temperature for 2 h and then transferred to a 500 mL round-bottom
flask, diluted with 300 mL of deionized water, and refluxed for 4
h. The solution was filtered and dried, and acid-insoluble lignin
was determined gravimetrically.
