7-Ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN38) and vorinostat
(SAHA) are
quite promising combination therapy agents applied to the clinical
treatment of cancer. In this study, we designed and synthesized a
series of novel SN38-SAHA co-prodrugs, which were conjugated by four
different amino acids including glycine, alanine, aminobutyric acid,
and 6-aminocaproic acid. The hydrolytic reconversion rate to SN38
and SAHA critically depended on the carbon chain length, which were
evaluated in PBS (pH 6.0/7.4) and plasma (human/mouse). With decreasing
amino acid chain length, the hydrolytic reconversion rate increased
gradually. The in vitro cytotoxicity test was evaluated by the sulforhodamine
B (SRB) assay on the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and
human colorectal cancer cell line HCT116. With the evaluation of stability
and in vitro cytotoxicity, an appropriate linker was found, and the
active drug can be released efficiently from compound 3a, which exhibited strong antiproliferative activity in A549 and HCT-116
cell lines correspondingly. These results indicated that the well-designed
co-prodrug 3a and this kind of strategy can be a promising
approach for anticancer therapy.

==== Body
Introduction
7-Ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38),
as a highly active topoisomerase
(Topo) I inhibitor, is the active metabolic product of its prodrug
irinotecan (CPT-11) commercially available as Camptosar.1,2 By combining with the Topo I-DNA covalent conjugate, the camptothecin
analogue forms a ternary complex that blocks the repolymerization
of the DNA strands during their replication leading to the cell apoptosis
eventually.3−5 Although SN-38 is about 100- to 1000-fold more potent
than irinotecan, its clinical application is limited by its poor solubility
and nonspecific toxicity.1 To improve these
deficiencies, many efforts have been made to develop prodrugs of SN-38
such as polymer-, albumin-, and immune conjugates,6,7 and
a number of these prodrugs have reached different stages of preclinical
or clinical trials.8−11 It has been suggested that cells arrested in G2/M by camptothecin
were most sensitive to subsequent addition of histone deacetylase
inhibitors (HDACIs).12,13 The mechanism of this phenomenon
is possibly caused by the HDACI-induced decreases in cyclin B levels
of the antiapoptotic proteins.14,15 In this regard, reduced
expression of these pivotal antiapoptotic factors by HDACIs, which
does not prevent tumor cell progression through the S phase, may increase
the cytotoxicity of Topo I inhibitors.

HDACIs can weaken the
interaction between DNA and histones by inducing
accumulation of acetylated histones. The weakness leads to the loosening
of the chromosome structure and disturbs transcriptional machinery,
which could cause cell apoptosis ultimately.16−19 Several HDACIs exhibit little
or no anticancer effects in preclinical studies, and some are in clinical
studies either as single agents16,20,21 or in combination with conventional chemotherapy. Suberoylanilide
hydroxamic acid (SAHA, vorinostat), which is an oral HDACI approved
by the FDA as a treatment for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), has
also shown strong anticancer effects in some sensitive cell lines.22,23 Despite promising clinical effects reported, SAHA is not efficient
for the treatment of solid cancers.20,24 Therefore,
SAHA has been used for drug combinations with other traditional chemotherapeutic
drugs like gemcitabine and camptothecin against solid cancers to exert
more cytotoxicity.25−27 In addition, SAHA has a tendency to hydrolyze to
the corresponding carboxylic acid derivative quickly in plasma, which
is completely inactive.28,29 For this kind of situation,
it is necessary to improve the stability of SAHA through structural
modification or other means while in clinical use. To overcome these
obstacles, SAHA has been designed in various forms, such as clickable
pH-responsive prodrug,30 selective enzymatic
cleavable prodrug,28 carbamate prodrug,31 thiol-sensitive prodrug,32 redox-responsive prodrug,33 and
so on.

Chemotherapy is one of the most commonly used treatments
for both
hematological diseases and solid tumors. However, it is usually found
that chemotherapy cannot achieve expected therapeutic efficacy but
can express high systemic toxicity.34 Besides,
drug resistance in tumors is a key reason for the low anticancer activity
of many drugs.35 Therefore, combination
therapy has been adopted to improve the therapeutic efficacy of drugs
while simultaneously reducing drug-related side effects by lowering
the respective dosage.

Employing multiple drugs possessing different
mechanisms of action
could induce cell death more effectively than single medication.36 As mentioned previously, SN38 and SAHA have
been shown synergistic antitumor effects in many works.27,37 Nevertheless, the clinical application was limited by the different
administrations of SN38 and SAHA. SN38 is metabolized from irinotecan
after intravenous injection, and SAHA is an oral preparation.22 The different administration of SN-38 and SAHA
may cause complex interaction. A promising strategy is conjugating
SN38 and SAHA to generate a co-prodrug that can hydrolyze to the two
active compounds at the same time under certain conditions (Figure 1). The mechanism
of release has been fully studied and characterized by other groups
(Figure 2).38 The co-prodrug contains a specialized nontoxic
linker to hide the activity of the parent molecule temporarily.

Figure 2 Proposed hydrolysis of the co-prodrugs.

In this manner, we can enhance the stability of
SAHA and obtain
synergistic therapy after cellular uptake of the SN38-SAHA co-prodrug.
The hydroxamic acid group is essential for SAHA, which can inhibit
the activity of HDAC by binding to the active site Zn2+.22,39,40 The design
of the co-prodrug is illustrated in Figure 1, which blocks the active parts of both SAHA
and SN-38. Four SN38-SAHA co-prodrugs were synthesized with different
aliphatic chain lengths (glycine (Gly) (3a), alanine
(Ala) (3b), aminobutyric acid (Abu) (3c),
and 6-aminocaproic acid (Eaca) (3d)). Our hypothesis
of the release mechanism is that the carbonic ester between the amino
acid and SAHA could be simply hydrolyzed or enzymatically hydrolyzed
at first.

Subsequently, the SN38 release mechanism (Figure 2) proceeds via nucleophilic
terminal amine
attack at the SN38 E-ring carbonyl lactone producing a circular intermediate.
Finally, the SN38 was produced by the intermediate through the attack
of the hydroxide ion in alkaline conditions.41 With increasing amino acid chain length, the formation of the circular
intermediates becomes more difficult and the SN-38 release of 3b–d mainly relies on the enzymatic hydrolysis.
Therefore, the reconversion rate of SN38 and SAHA may increase with
decreasing chain length of the amino acid.

Generally, the novel
concept co-prodrug was presented there, and
four SN38-SAHA co-prodrugs were synthesized. Briefly, we conjugated
the hydroxamic acid of SAHA and the 20-OH of SN-38 through a series
of amino acids to form inactive co-prodrugs. Compared with combination
therapy, such co-prodrugs can improve the stability of SN38 and SAHA,
increasing the anticancer effects while the co-prodrug releases two
active drugs inside the cancer cells simultaneously. Co-prodrug reconversion
was studied at pH 6.0/7.4 phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and human/mouse
plasma. The metabolic transformation of the co-prodrugs to the drugs
was catalyzed by hydrolysis and enzymolysis.42 Cytotoxicity was evaluated in HCT116 and A549 cell lines using the
SRB assay. These results suggested that 3a, which is
conjugated by glycine, was the best candidate.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of the SN38-SAHA Co-Prodrugs
The 3a–d co-prodrugs were synthesized through a four-step
procedure with CH2Cl2 as the solvent. First,
the 10-OH of SN-38 was protected by the butoxycarbonyl group (Boc),
and then the 10-Boc-SN38 was coupled to four different Boc-protected
amino acids resulting in compounds 1a–d (Scheme 1). Cleavage
of the Boc group from compounds 1a–d was performed using 30% TFA in CH2Cl2, resulting
in 2a–d. Finally, we activated the
SAHA to a reactive intermediate by reacting with CDI and then using
the terminal amine of 2a–d to attack
the ring of the SAHA reactive intermediate produced compounds 3a–d.39 The
progress of the reaction was monitored by thin layer chromatography
(TLC). All reactions were processed with good yields and purified
to high purity. Each compound and the final product were confirmed
by 1H NMR and mass spectrometry.

the degradation curve of co-prodrugs in pH 6.0 PBS.

In Vitro Degradation and Release of SN38-SAHA Co-Prodrugs in
PBS
The standard curves of various compounds were prepared
for the convenience of calculation. The hydrolysis studies of 3a–d were first performed in PBS at pH
6.0/7.4 at 37 °C for a period of 24 h (Figure 3). The disappearance of 3a–d and the formation of SN38 and SAHA were quantified using
HPLC. The percentages of remaining 3a–d and converted SN38 and SAHA were plotted as a function of time.
The cumulative release and formation curves in Figure 3A–C showed that 3a has
the fastest rate to reconversion of SN38 and SAHA. The longer the
chain length of the co-prodrugs, the faster the hydrolysis of the
co-prodrugs and the formation of SN38 were. The half-lives (t1/2) of 3b–d were found to be beyond 24 h, while the t1/2 of 3a was merely 2 h at pH 7.4. 24 h later, the formation
percentages of SN38 were 26.3 and 3.4% corresponding to 3a and 3b, respectively, while 3c and 3d almost have no SN38 generated; besides, the formation of
SAHA decreased with increasing carbon chain length. In pH 6.0 PBS,
the t1/2 of 3a–d were found to be far beyond 24 h, and the reconversions
of SN38 and SAHA were little either as illustrated in Figure 3D. As our hypothesis before,
increasing the chain length of amino acid generally increases the
co-prodrug reconversion time because of the difficulty to form the
cyclic intermediate. Moreover, the co-prodrugs were more stable in
weak acid conditions.

In Vitro Degradation and Release of SN38-SAHA Co-Prodrugs in
Plasma
The hydrolysis studies of 3a–d were then performed in human plasma and mouse plasma at
37 °C (Figure 4). The disappearance of 3a–d and
the formation of SN38/SAHA were quantified using HPLC. The percentages
of the remaining 3a–d and converted
SN-38/SAHA were plotted as a function of time. The co-prodrugs had
a short t1/2 in both human and mouse plasma.
The t1/2 of 3a–d were found to be between 0.5 and 2 h, and the highest reconversions
of SN38 were 37.1, 19.2, 22.9, and 0.0%, respectively, in mouse plasma.
In contrast, the t1/2 of 3a–d were extended in human plasma compared to
mouse plasma. The t1/2 of 3a–d in human plasma were 1, 3, 5, and 5 h, and
the highest reconversions of SN38 were 39.8, 20.5, 16.3, and 3.2%,
respectively. The HPLC peak of SAHA was according with some substance
in the plasma so that the conversion rate of SAHA had not listed out.
Compared to PBS stability experiments, the rates of degradation were
much faster in plasma, suggesting that the enzymatic hydrolysis is
an important pathway here. Besides, the formation of SN38/SAHA seemed
easier and faster in plasma, which means that the co-prodrug may release
the active drug more completely in vivo.

plasma; (D) the formation curve of SN38 in human plasma.

Cytotoxicity of 3a–d Co-Prodrugs
After assuring that SN38-SAHA co-prodrugs could hydrolyze efficiently,
the in vitro biological efficacy of 3a–d was evaluated in A549 and HCT116 by the SRB assay. The IC50 values of 3a–c were more potent
than SAHA but less potent than SN38, and the IC50 value
of 3d fell far below 3c on A549 and HCT116.
As expected, the IC50 of 3a was almost equivalent
to that of the SN38, suggesting that the toxicity mainly depended
on the stability (i.e., co-prodrug hydrolysis and SN38/SAHA formation).
Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of 3a–d increased nearly proportionally as the amino acid carbon chain length
decreased, and the order of the co-prodrugs tested was 3a > 3b > 3c > 3d (Table 1). Co-prodrugs have
slow degradation processes to release active compounds. Therefore,
the most active synthesized compound 3a was less cytotoxic
than SN38. We could possess a longer action time than the original
drugs in this way. Besides, we intended to increase the targeting
ability by the hydroxamic acid group of SAHA.

Conclusions
In summary, we synthesized the SN38-SAHA
co-prodrugs with four
different chain lengths of amino acid, and the strategy was a promising
approach for anticancer therapy. After SAHA was released readily,
the rest of the prodrugs containing terminal amines occurred, and
essentially complete hydrolysis of SN38 was through the formation
of the cyclic intermediate or the esterase hydrolysis directly. The
hydrolysis rule of 3a–d was found
to be pH-dependent and approximately proportional to the amino acid
carbon chain length. Among these co-prodrugs, compound 3a showed similar antiproliferative activity to SN38. The results of
in vitro stability confirmed the complete conversion from compound 3a to SN-38 in different plasma. Therefore, this kind of strategy
has potential in the cancer therapy for different drug combinations.
Considering the effect of the co-prodrug on the cytotoxicity test,
animal studies on mice bearing lung or colorectal cancer will be conducted
in future.

Synthesis of the SN38-SAHA Co-Prodrugs
Synthesis of 10-Boc-SN38
SN-38 (3 g, 7.65 mmol) was
dispersed in CH2Cl2 (300 mL), and then (Boc)2O (2 g, 9.18 mmol) and pyridine (1.85 mL, 22.9 mmol) were
added sequentially. After stirring for 12 h at 25 °C, the reaction
mixture was washed with a saturated aqueous solution of NaHCO3, water, and brine. The mixture was then dried over Na2SO4 and filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated
under reduced pressure to give 10-Boc-SN38 (3.7 g, 7.5 mmol, 98%)
as a pale-yellow solid.

General Method for Synthesis of 3a–d
SAHA was dispersed in CH2Cl2 (20 mL), and then CDI was added. The reaction mixture was cooled
to 0 °C for 0.5 h. After stirring for 1 h at 25 °C, compounds 2a–d were added and stirred for 15 h at
25 °C. The reaction mixture was diluted with CH2Cl2 and washed with 0.1 M hydrochloric acid, water, and brine.
The mixture was then dried over Na2SO4 and filtered,
and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue
was purified using silica gel column chromatography with CH2Cl2 and MeOH to give 3a–d as yellow solids.

HPLC Analysis of SN38-SAHA Co-Prodrug
Chromatographic
detection was carried out by using Agilent 1200 high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC, Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) with a Diamonsil C18
(250 mm × 4.6 mm) column. The detection was conducted at 254
nm (UV detector) with the column temperature at room temperature.
The sample volume for each injection was 50 μL. The gradient
elution was applied with a mobile phase of acetonitrile (ACN) containing
0.1% formic acid and water containing 0.1% formic acid with a constant
flow rate of 1 mL/min: 0–15 min (5% ACN to 95% ACN), 15–25
min (95% ACN). The external standard method was established by HPLC
in order to determine the content of each compound.

In Vitro Degradation and Release of SN38-SAHA Co-Prodrugs in
PBS
SN38-SAHA co-prodrug solutions with a concentration of
100 μM/L were diluted to 0.05 μM/L with 10 mM PBS buffer
(pH 7.4/6.0). After incubation at 37 °C for 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4,
6, 12, 24, and 48 h, the areas of SN38-SAHA co-prodrugs and other
species were detected by HPLC as well. Then each compound was calculated
by the concentration–area standard curve, which was obtained
by the external standard method.

In Vitro Degradation and Release of SN38-SAHA Co-Prodrugs in
Plasma
SN38-SAHA co-prodrug solutions with a concentration
of 100 μM/L were diluted to 0.1 μM/L by plasma (human/mouse).
After incubation at 37 °C for 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 h, 50 μL
of reaction mixture was quenched with 50 μL of cold ACN and
centrifuged at 30000 rpm × 5 min. The supernatant (50 μL)
was detected by HPLC. Then each compound was calculated by the concentration–area
standard curve, which was obtained by the external standard method.

Cytotoxicity of 3a–d Co-Prodrugs
The in vitro biological efficacy of 3a–d was evaluated in A549 and HCT116 cell lines. Briefly, the
cells were seeded into 96-well microtest plates (1.0 × 104 cells per well) in 100 μL of culture medium. Cells
were treated in triplicate with gradient concentrations of test drugs
and incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. The cell viabilities on the
cell lines were determined by the SRB assay subsequently. The drug
concentration required for 50% growth inhibition (IC50)
of tumor cells was determined from the dose–response curves.
