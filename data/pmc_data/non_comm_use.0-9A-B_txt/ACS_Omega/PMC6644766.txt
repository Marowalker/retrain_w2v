For
a better understanding of protein–inhibitor interactions,
we report structural, thermodynamic, and biological analyses of the
interactions between S-trityl-l-cysteine
(STLC) derivatives and the motor domain of kinesin spindle protein
Eg5. Binding of STLC-type inhibitors to Eg5 was enthalpically driven
and entropically unfavorable. The introduction of a para-methoxy substituent in one phenyl ring of STLC enhances its inhibitory
activity resulting from a larger enthalpy gain possibly due to the
increased shape complementarity. The substituent fits to a recess
in the binding pocket. To avoid steric hindrance, the substituted
STLC is nudged toward the side opposite to the recess, which enhances
the interaction of Eg5 with the remaining part of the inhibitor. Further
introduction of an ethylene linkage between two phenyl rings enhances
Eg5 inhibitory activity by reducing the loss of entropy in forming
the complex. This study provides valuable examples of enhancing protein–inhibitor
interactions without forming additional hydrogen bonds.

Introduction
In recent years, the
discovery and development of molecular-targeted
agents have been carried out by high-throughput biological evaluation
of chemical libraries consisting of small molecules. Hit compounds
in the early stage of drug screening often have low affinity for their
target biomolecules and show the expected biological activities only
at high concentrations. Structure–activity relationship (SAR)
studies using the structure-related molecules of initial hit compounds
can lead to the identification of more potent compounds with high
affinity for the target biomolecules.1,2 Crystal structure
analysis is a powerful tool for the development of molecular-targeted
agents. Detailed structural information on the interaction between
a target protein and the hit compounds can help the rational design
of small-molecule candidates with high affinity for the target in
silico, which leads to structure-based drug design or fragment-based
drug discovery.1,3−5 Then, the biological
activity of individual designed compounds is confirmed by molecular
biology-based compound evaluation. There are reports showing the crystal
structures of target biomolecules in complex with inhibitors that
are well developed to have high inhibitory activity toward the targets.6−9 However, few articles focus on the structural differences of protein–inhibitor
complexes by using a series of structure-related derivatives with
different affinities. For an efficient in silico design of compounds
fitting more tightly into the binding pocket of a particular target
protein, it is required to accumulate structural analyses of protein–inhibitor
interactions between a target protein and a series of inhibitor derivatives.
Thermodynamic analysis is also informative of the rational drug design
in SAR research works. However, there are only a few reports on both
of the crystal structures and thermodynamic analyses of protein–inhibitor
complexes, such as HIV-1 protease10,11 and matrix
metalloprotease.12 Studies are attempting
to predict the binding affinities and thermodynamic parameters, such
as enthalpic (ΔH) and entropic (−TΔS) contributions using high-resolution
crystal structures, but it remains difficult to predict entropic components.13,14 More experimental data are needed to improve such prediction methods.

As the mitotic kinesin Eg5 is an attractive target for clinical
cancer therapies,15 many Eg5 inhibitors,
including S-trityl-l-cysteine (STLC), have
been reported since the discovery of the first Eg5 inhibitor monastrol.16,17 Some of them, such as ispinesib and filanesib (ARRY-520), have been
used in clinical trials as anticancer drugs.17 To date, there have been several structural studies of the Eg5 motor
domain in complex with its inhibitors with different chemical scaffolds,
such as monastrol,18 STLC,19 ispinesib,20,21 and others.22 These inhibitors bind to the same allosteric pocket of
Eg5 formed by the L5 loop and α2 and α3 helices in the
presence of adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) or adenosine 5′-diphosphate
(ADP) and inhibit the release of ADP from the protein.23,24 However, no comparative studies of crystal structure analysis and
thermodynamic analysis using a series of the structure-related derivatives
have been conducted, and sufficient lessons have not been obtained
from the enormous efforts
in the SAR studies.

STLC was found as a potent inhibitor for
human Eg5 protein,25,26 and SAR studies using STLC derivatives
have been reported by Kozielski’s
and our groups.27,28 Here, we have performed crystal
structure analyses and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analyses
using the Eg5 motor domain along with STLC and the two more potent
derivatives: one with a para-methoxy substituent
in one phenyl ring (PVEI0021) and the other with an ethylene linkage
between two phenyl rings of PVEI0021 (PVEI0138). In this report, comparative
studies of structural and thermodynamic analyses show how the substituents
introduced into the initial hit STLC enhance the interaction of the
STLC-type compounds with Eg5.

Results
STLC Derivatives Show Potent
Inhibitory Effects against Eg5
ATPase Activity
Two STLC derivatives, PVEI0021 and PVEI0138,
were found as Eg5 inhibitors that worked in vitro and in cultured
cells.25,28 PVEI0021 possesses a single para-methoxy substituent in one phenyl ring of the trityl group in STLC
(Figure 1A), and was
10-fold more potent than STLC in inhibition of the ATPase activity
of Eg5 motor domain consisting of the N-terminal 369 residues of Eg5
(Eg51–369).25 PVEI0138
is a cross-linked derivative with an ethylene linker between two phenyl
rings of the trityl group in PVEI0021 (Figure 1A), and was 10-fold more potent than PVEI0021
in the inhibition of Eg5 enzymatic activity.28 In this study, we used an N-terminally truncated mutant lacking
the first 16 residues, Eg517–369, to determine a
high-resolution structure by producing high-quality crystals of Eg5
with the individual Eg5 inhibitors. Eg517–369 showed
higher thermal stability than Eg51–369 (Figure 1B), although it showed
about 65% ATPase activity compared to Eg51–369 in
our ATPase assay conditions. Using Eg517–369, we
evaluated the ability of the STLC derivatives to thermally stabilize
the Eg5 motor domain (Figure 1B). The results of inhibitor-mediated changes in thermal denaturation
temperatures were consistent with those using Eg51–369. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of the STLC derivatives on
the Eg517–369 ATPase activity in the presence and
absence of taxol-stabilized microtubules (MTs) were also confirmed
(Figure 1C,D). The
half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of
the STLC derivatives are listed in Figure 1E, which were similar to those using Eg51–369.28 These results indicate
that Eg517–369 is sensitive to the Eg5 inhibitors,
similar to Eg51–369, and could be suitable for crystallization
analyses. Therefore, we proceeded with structure determination of
the Eg5 motor domain complexed with each STLC-type inhibitor using
Eg517–369.

ΔT when using Eg51–369 are
also presented for reference. a Values were previously
reported by our group.28

Overall Structures
Crystals of Eg517–369 in complex with PVEI0138 or PVEI0021 were obtained
in two crystal
forms: one belonged to space group P21, and the other to C2. The structures of the Eg517–369–PVEI0138 complex (C2
type) and the Eg517–369–PVEI0021 complex
(P21 and C2 types) were
determined at resolutions of 2.6, 2.2, and 2.7 Å (Table 1). All of these structures contain
two molecules (subsequently named A and B) in an asymmetric unit.
The final model of Eg517–369–PVEI0138 contains
residues 16–366, one Mg2+ ADP, and one PVEI0138
for molecules A and B. Residue 16 is a methionine derived from the
expression vector (see Supporting Information). Residues 55–58 (L2) and 272–286 (L11) are missing
for molecules A and B (Figure 2A). These loop regions are also missing in other Eg5 structures.21,29,30 Both the final models of Eg517–369–PVEI0021 (P21 and C2 types) contain residues 16–367, one
Mg2+ ADP, and one PVEI0021 for molecules A and B. Residues
55–60 (L2) and 272–286 (L11) are missing for molecules
A and B. PVEI0138 and PVEI0021 have well-defined electron densities
in the structures and are located in the inhibitor-binding pocket
bordered by helix α2, loop L5, and helix α3 (Figures 2B and S1), as observed in the Eg51–368–STLC complex.19 ADP also has well-defined
electron densities in all of the structures, and each ADP is located
in the ADP-binding pocket in the same orientation observed in the
Eg51–368–STLC complex19 (Figure S2).

dotted lines indicate the disordered regions. Helix α2, loop
L5, and helix α3 are colored yellow. (B) Close-up view of PVEI0138
and its binding pocket. The Fo–Fc omit map of PVEI0138 was calculated with phases
from the model without PVEI0138, contoured at 3σ, and colored
cyan. The values of the real space correlation coefficient of PVEI0138
are 0.899 in chain A and 0.888 in chain B. This view is almost the
same as that in (A).

The structures of the Eg5 motor
domain in complex with STLC-type
inhibitors were superposed well with each other using PDBeFold32 (Table S2 and Figures S2 and S3). As for the two structures
of Eg517–369–PVEI0021 (P21 and C2 types), the patterns of crystal
packing can be regarded as being nearly the same between the P21- and C2-type PVEI0021 complexes
(see Figure S4 for details). Therefore,
in the following description, the structure of the P21-type PVEI0021 complex is used as a PVEI0021-bound structure
to compare with other STLC-type inhibitor-complexed structures. Because
molecules A of the Eg5 motor domain in complex with PVEI0138, PVEI0021
(P21 type), and STLC are in similar structures
to root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) values less than 0.8 Å (Table S2), these three structures are used to
discuss the difference in the structures of the Eg5 motor domain bound
to each inhibitor in the following description (see Table S2 and Figures S2 and S3 for
details).

Differences in Inhibitor Binding among STLC-type Inhibitor Complexes
The structures of inhibitor-binding sites of the Eg5 motor domain
in complex with STLC, PVEI0021, and PVEI0138 were compared. The amino
N atom of the cysteine moiety of STLC is hydrogen-bonded to Glu116
Oε1 and Gly117 O atoms. The carboxy O atom of the cysteine moiety
of STLC is hydrogen-bonded to Arg221 Nη1.19 These hydrogen bonds are commonly observed in three structures
of STLC, PVEI0021, and PVEI0138 complexes (Figure 3). The salt bridges between the side chains
of Glu116 and Arg221 are also commonly observed in the three structures,
although the salt bridges are not observed in the inhibitor-free structure
of Eg5–ADP·Mg2+.33 The surface area of Eg5 interfacing with inhibitor was calculated
as shown in Table S3A. Glu116, Arg119,
Leu214, and Ala218 are common residues with large interface areas.
We name each portion of the inhibitor-binding pockets as follows:
“Top”, “Bottom”, “Left-side”,
“Right-side”, “Front”, and “Back”,
as shown in Figure 4B. Both methoxy moieties of PVEI0021 and PVEI0138 are surrounded
by the side chains of Top Glu116 and Arg221, Bottom Leu214, Right-side
Ile136, Leu160, and Phe239 and form van der Waals interactions with
them. In previously determined crystal structure of the Eg5 motor
domain in complex with an STLC derivative having a para-substituted
chlorine in one phenyl ring, the para-chlorophenyl
ring is located in a similar pocket to the para-methoxyphenyl
group of PVEI0021.34 The surface area of
Top Glu116 interfacing with PVEI0021 (41 Å2) is larger
than that with STLC (38 Å2, Table S3A). The surface area of Bottom Leu214 interfacing with PVEI0021
(40 Å2) is also larger than that with STLC (36 Å2, Table S3A). These two differences
are ascribable to the addition of van der Waals interactions of the para-methoxy substituent with the side chains of Top Glu116
and Bottom Leu214. The other residues of Top Arg221, and Right-side
Ile136, Leu160, and Phe239 show no increased interface area (Table S3A). For the STLC and PVEI0021 complexes,
the side chains of Top and Bottom residues are nearly in the same
locations, but those of Right-side residues shift to a small extent
(Figure 3A). Differences
in the locations are as follows: Top Glu116 Cδ, 0.3 Å;
Arg221 Cζ, 0.2 Å; Bottom Leu214 Cγ, 0.3 Å; Right-side
Ile136 Cβ, 0.4 Å; Leu160 Cγ, 0.3 Å; and Phe239
Cγ, 0.6 Å. The shift of the Right-side wall broadens the
pocket volume around the para-substituted phenyl (3 in Figure 4B) to a small extent (Figure 4A,B).

sites of the Eg5 motor domain

the structure of the Eg517–369–PVEI0138 complex

complex (P21 type); (C) Eg517–369–PVEI0138 complex. Molecule A was used to generate these figures.
STLC (magenta), PVEI0021 (cyan), and PVEI0138 (orange) are shown as
stick models. The views are almost the same as those in Figure 3A. In (B), the names of the
walls forming the binding pocket are also labeled with the same color
as the side chains shown as stick models: Top (Glu116 and Arg221)
and Bottom (Leu214), green; Front (Glu215) and Back (Ala133 and Pro137),
orange; Left-side (Arg119, Trp127, and Tyr211); and Right-side (Ile136,
Leu160, and Phe239); yellow. Phenyl or methoxyphenyl groups of PVEI0021
are numbered.

Due to the presence of
the para-methoxy substituent,
the C atom in the center of the trityl group of PVEI0021 was displaced
0.5 Å from that of STLC (Figure 3A). Compared to STLC, PVEI0138 and para-chloro STLC, as a whole molecule, also shift 0.6 Å to the Left-side
(Figures 3A and S5A,D). For reference, the locations of ADP are
nearly identical in the four STLC-type inhibitor complexes (Figure S2). The differences in the positions
of ADP molecules are less than 0.1 Å in the four structures (Figure S5C,D). Because of the shift, the two
phenyl rings (1 and 2 in Figure 4B) easily interact with neighboring residues of Left-side
Arg119, Trp127, and Tyr211, and Front Glu215. Comparing the STLC and
PVEI0021 complexes, the side chains of the Left-side residues shift
to some extent (Figure 3A). Differences in the locations are as follows: Left-side Arg119
Cδ, 0.9 Å; Trp127 Cβ, 0.6 Å; Tyr211 Cε1,
0.3 Å; and Front Glu215 Cβ, 0.3 Å. These residues
move away from the inhibitor and thus broaden the pocket volume around
two phenyl rings 1 and 2 (Figure 4A,B). The surface area of Left-side Tyr211 interfacing
with PVEI0021 (25 Å2) is larger than that with STLC
(22 Å2, Table S3A). These
differences may contribute to the higher affinity of PVEI0021 with
Eg5 than that of STLC.

In addition to a methoxy substituent
to the phenyl group, PVEI0138
possesses an ethylene linker between the other two phenyl rings 1
and 2 of the trityl group (Figure 1A). There are no additional hydrogen-bonding interactions
between the protein and PVEI0138 compared to PVEI0021. Residues of
Left-side Arg119, Trp127, and Tyr211, Back Pro137, Bottom Leu214,
and Front Glu215 are located around and in van der Waals interactions
with the ethylene linker of PVEI0138 (Figure 3B). Comparing PVEI0021 and PVEI0138 complexes,
the side chains of Bottom and Front residues shift to some extent
(Figure 3B). Differences
in the locations are as follows: Left-side Arg119 Cδ, 0.2 Å;
Trp127 Cβ, 0.2 Å; Tyr211 Cε1, 0.1 Å; Back Pro137
Cβ, 0.2 Å; Bottom Leu214 Cβ, 0.6 Å; and Front
Glu215 Cβ, 0.5 Å. Because the ethylene linker connects
two phenyl rings 1 and 2, the distances between the two C atoms attaching
the ethylene linker of PVEI0138 (2.9 Å) is shorter than those
of PVEI0021 (3.3 Å), STLC (3.1 Å), and para-chloro STLC (3.2 Å, Figure S5B).
As a result, the two phenyl ring moieties of PVEI0138 approach the
side chain of Left-side Arg119, and the surface area of Arg119 interfacing
with PVEI0138 (34 Å2) is larger than that with PVEI0021
(31 Å2, Table S3A), although
the location of the Left-side wall is nearly the same between the
PVEI0021 and PVEI0138 complexes. The side chain of Front Glu215 also
comes close to the ethylene linker of PVEI0138 in comparison to PVEI0021,
and the surface area of Glu215 interfacing with PVEI0138 (19 Å2) is larger than that with PVEI0021 (15 Å2, Table S3A). The increase in the surface
area interfacing with PVEI0138 compared to PVEI0021 contributes to
the increased van der Waals interactions. In contrast, the side chain
of Bottom Leu214 moves away from the ethylene linker of PVEI0138 in
comparison to PVEI0021, and the surface area of Leu214 interfacing
with PVEI0138 (35 Å2) is smaller than that with PVEI0021
(40 Å2, Table S3A). According
to the comparison between PVEI0021 and PVEI0138 complexes, the addition
of an ethylene linker broadens the Bottom space and shrinks the Front
space, although the Left-side and Back walls show no remarkable change
(Figure 4B,C). These
differences may result in a more stable interaction of PVEI0138 with
Eg5 than that of PVEI0021.

The volumes of the binding pocket
of STLC, PVEI0021, and PVEI0138
complexes are 474, 507, and 558 Å3, respectively (Table S3B). In addition, the molecular surface
areas of the binding pocket of STLC, PVEI0021, and PVEI0138 complexes
are 346, 394, and 426 Å2, respectively (Table S3B). The volume and surface area of the
pocket become larger with the introduction of a para-methoxy substituent and an ethylene linker, and accordingly, the
inhibitory effects become larger. To investigate how well the STLC-type
inhibitors fit into the binding pocket, we calculated the shape complementarity
(Sc) values of the interfaces between Eg5 motor domain and STLC-type
inhibitors with the program Sc36 (Table S3C), which is often used to evaluate the
interfaces of protein–protein interactions37,38 or protein–ligand interactions.39,40 Sc values can range from 0 to 1. Interfaces with Sc = 1 fit perfectly,
whereas interfaces with Sc = 0 mean topologically uncorrelated surfaces.
All of the STLC-type inhibitors show excellent shape complementarity
with the binding pocket. The Sc values of STLC, PVEI0021, and PVEI0138
complexes are 0.785, 0.811, and 0.814, respectively (Table S3C). These values are much higher than the values for
antibody–antigen interfaces (0.64–0.68).36 The results suggests that the introduction of
a para-methoxy substituent and an ethylene linker
leads to higher shape complementarity.

Thermodynamics of STLC-type
Inhibitors Binding to Eg5
To analyze the thermodynamics of
STLC-type inhibitors binding to
Eg5, ITC experiments were performed using Eg517–369 (Figure 5). The resulting
thermodynamic parameters were determined and calculated as shown in Table 2. A binding stoichiometry
for STLC was 0.94 ± 0.003, close to 1. However, each binding
stoichiometry for PVEI0021 and PVEI0138 was relatively low, probably
due to the low solubility of PVEI0021 and PVEI0138 in this study.
Each KD value was 67 ± 8.8 nM for
STLC, 6.3 ± 1.8 nM for PVEI0021, and <1 nM for PVEI0138. The
approximate KD value for PVEI0138 was
0.9 nM, although the value was under a detection limit. PVEI0021 showed
1 order of magnitude higher affinity to Eg517–369 than STLC, and PVEI0138 showed approximately 1 order of magnitude
higher affinity to Eg517–369 than PVEI0021. The
binding of STLC to Eg517–369 was enthalpically driven
(ΔH = −11.6 ± 0.1 kcal/mol) and
entropically neutral or a bit unfavorable (−TΔS = 1.8 kcal/mol). In comparison to STLC,
the binding of PVEI0021 to Eg517–369 was enthalpically
more favorable by 5.0 kcal/mol (ΔH = −16.6
± 0.1 kcal/mol), but was entropically more unfavorable by 3.7
kcal/mol (−TΔS = 5.5
kcal/mol). The para-methoxy substituent contributed
to an enthalpically more stable interaction with Eg517–369. In the binding of PVEI0138, a change in enthalpy (ΔH = −16.5 ± 0.3 kcal/mol) was similar to that
of PVEI0021. However, a change in entropy (−TΔS = 4.2 kcal/mol) was more favorable by 1.3
kcal/mol than that of PVEI0021. In total, the values of Gibbs energy
ΔG of STLC, PVEI0021, and PVEI0138 are −9.8,
−11.2, and −12.3 kcal/mol, respectively, and Eg517–369–STLC-type inhibitor complexes become more
stable in this order. These results were consistent with those obtained
by our biochemical analyses, including Eg5 ATPase assays and differential
scanning fluorimetry (Figure 1).28

Discussion
Here,
we report the structural and thermodynamic analyses of kinesin
spindle protein Eg5 in complex with STLC-type inhibitors using X-ray
crystallography and ITC. This study provides two interesting examples
of the effects of the substituent introduction to enhance the protein–inhibitor
interactions without forming additional new hydrogen bonds between
the protein and the inhibitor. One example suggests that the shape
complementarity of inhibitors in the binding pockets of the target
protein can be used as a valuable indicator for designing more potent
inhibitors in SAR studies. The other example provides scientific evidence
for the well-known but empirical strategy of introducing cyclization
cross-linkers to obtain stronger inhibitors.

In SAR research,
effective methods to design more potent bioactive
compounds based on the chemical structures of the initial hit compounds
are desired. In computer-aided designs of more potent inhibitors,
valid calculated values are required as useful indicators for predicting
which compounds with similar chemical structures are superior in the
inhibitory activity. The surface area of proteins interfacing with
inhibitors is often described in scientific reports of structural
analysis of protein–inhibitor complexes because it is believed
to correlate with the van der Waals interaction. The shape complementarity,
originally devised as an indicator of protein–protein interactions,
has been previously proposed to be used as an indicator for the evaluation
of the inhibitor structures.36−40 According to the conventional lock-and-key model about the relationship
between enzymes and substrates, the shape complementarity is considered
useful for the optimization of protein–inhibitor interactions.
However, the values of shape complementarity are not often mentioned
in the papers reporting SAR studies of inhibitors or structural analysis
of protein–inhibitor complexes. In the case of Eg5 and PVEI0021
shown in this study, the increase in the Eg5 inhibitory activity is
accompanied by the improvement in the shape complementarity (Table S3C). The para-methoxy
substituent of PVEI0021, the substituent added onto STLC, is surrounded
by the Top, Bottom, and Right-side residues of the pocket (Figure 4B), which contributes
to a higher shape complementarity with PVEI0021 than STLC (Figures 3A and 4A,B). In addition, the para-methoxy substituent
causes a steric hindrance with the neighboring Right-side residues
and thus the inhibitor molecule is totally shifted by 0.5 Å to
the Left-side wall compared to STLC (Figures 3A and S5A). By
approaching closer to the Left-side wall than STLC, PVEI0021 also
shows a higher shape complementarity at the site opposite to the para-methoxy substituent. This is the first report showing
that a placement shift of the inhibitor within the binding pocket
caused by the introduction of an additional substituent can result
in a significant improvement in the shape complementarity between
the protein and the inhibitor. In the conversion from STLC to PVEI0021,
the shape complementarity becomes higher from 0.785 to 0.811 (Table S3C). At the same time, the surface area
of the binding pocket interfacing with the inhibitor increases from
288 to 294 Å2 (Table S3A). The shape complementarity of the protein–inhibitor interaction,
rather than the interface area, seems to correlate with the van der
Waals interaction between the protein and the inhibitor, and also
with the large gain of enthalpy in forming the protein–inhibitor
complex (Table 2).
Therefore, this study suggests that, in the computer-aided modeling
of a protein complex with newly designed candidate derivatives, the
shape complementarity of protein–inhibitor complexes can work
as one of the effective indicators for predicting the inhibitory potency
of the candidate derivatives. The idea of quantifying spatial complementarity
in the binding interface between a protein and an inhibitor is quite
significant. It is desirable to develop better methods for evaluating
spatial complementarity of protein–inhibitor interactions.

When designing more potent inhibitors based on the initial hit
compounds, introduction of cyclization cross-linkers is known as a
plausible strategy. PVEI0138 is a cyclized derivative of PVEI0021
with an ethylene cross-linkage between two phenyl rings, and is a
successful example of the strategy. It is a more potent Eg5 inhibitor
in the Eg5 ATPase assay and the DSF than PVEI0021 (Figure 1). Our studies provide scientific
evidence for the effectiveness of the cyclization strategy. In the
conversion from PVEI0021 to PVEI0138, the structural analysis shows
the same state in the hydrogen bonds of the protein–inhibitor
complexes. The striking differences between PVEI0138 and PVEI0021
complexes were observed only in a change in entropy in forming the
protein–inhibitor complex. Although both of the complexes were
entropically unfavorable, the complex formation of the Eg5 motor domain
with PVEI0138 caused more reduced loss of entropy (4.2 kcal/mol) than
with PVEI0021 (5.5 kcal/mol). The main reason for this is thought
to be that PVEI0138, due to the presence of the cyclization cross-linkage
between two phenyl rings, is a more rigid molecule with a lower degree
of freedom compared to PVEI0021. The presence of the cross-linkage
increases the volume of the binding pocket for PVEI0138 compared to
PVEI0021. This cramped accommodation of PVEI0138 in the binding pocket
may also contribute to the reduction of the loss of entropy in the
degree of freedom of the PVEI0138 complex. In the structural analysis,
even though the two phenyl rings are cross-linked with an ethylene
linker, the spatial position of the two phenyl groups of PVEI0138
is almost the same as that of PVEI0021 (Figure 3B). There are no significant differences
in the shape complementarity and the interface area between the protein
and each inhibitor, and the gain level of enthalpy in forming the
protein–inhibitor complex is quite similar in the two complexes.
Therefore, it is considered that the reduced loss of entropy in forming
the PVEI0138 complex contributes directly to the binding affinity
of the inhibitor to the protein. Our previous SAR study showed that
the Eg5 inhibitory activity drastically decreases if the length of
the cross-linker is longer or shorter than that of the ethylene cross-linker.28 In the case of such cyclized derivatives, the
gain in enthalpy in protein–inhibitor complex formation is
thought to be much smaller than the reduced loss of entropy produced
by conversion of candidate compounds to more rigid molecules.

Understanding protein–inhibitor interactions at the molecular
and atomic levels is a major issue in the field of medicinal chemistry.
Understanding them in terms of thermodynamics is also important. Due
to the thermal motion of solvent molecules, proteins and inhibitors
in solution under physiological conditions are always fluctuating
during their association, complex formation, and dissociation. By
structural and thermodynamic analyses in addition to biochemical analysis,
this study shows an importance of the shape complementarity as an
indicator of the stability of the protein–inhibitor binding
state. It also supports the effectiveness of introducing a cyclization
cross-linkage as a strategy for designing more potent inhibitors.
Performing both crystal structure analysis and thermodynamic analysis
is beneficial for finding small but important differences in protein−inhibitor
interactions. A deep understanding of protein–inhibitor interactions
by several different analytical methods will lead to the establishment
of better ways to design more potent inhibitors in SAR studies. There
may be points of view to which we did not pay enough attention in
this study, even though they are important. More structural and thermodynamic
studies on protein–inhibitor interactions are required to validate
existing strategies for designing more potent inhibitors and to develop
various inhibitor design strategies. In conclusion, this study not
only provides valuable information for rational drug design, but also
shows the importance of executing biochemical analysis, structural
analysis, and thermodynamic analysis in parallel to establish highly
versatile and rational drug design methodology.

Materials and Methods
Eg5 Inhibitors
STLC, PVEI0021, and PVEI0138 (Figure 1A) were synthesized
as described previously (compounds 1 and 4f in ref (25); compounds 3, 3b, and
5b in ref (28)).25,28

Preparation and Biochemical Assay of Eg5
Eg517–369 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) CodonPlus RIL as a C-terminal His6 fusion protein. The
expression plasmid and protein purification from bacterial extracts
were described in the Supporting Information. Enzymatic assays to evaluate the basal and MT-stimulated ATPase
activities of Eg517–369 and differential scanning
fluorimetry analyses to examine the thermal stability of Eg517–369 were performed using Eg517–369 instead of Eg51–369, along with ATP, as described previously.25,28,29

Protein Crystallization
The purified protein was mixed
with each inhibitor at a molar ratio of 1:5. Crystallization was performed
using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C. Crystallization
drops were prepared by mixing 0.5 μL of the protein–inhibitor
solution and 0.5 μL of the reservoir solution. In the case of
the Eg517–369–PVEI0138 complex, the protein–inhibitor
solution contained 17.4 mg/mL (0.41 mM) Eg517–369, 2.0 mM PVEI0138 in buffer A, and 5% (w/v) sucrose. Buffer A contained
50 mM piperazine-1,4-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (PIPES)–NaOH
(pH 6.8), 0.4 M NaCl, 1 mM ADP, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ethylene
glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic
acid (EGTA)–NaOH, and 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP)–HCl.
The reservoir solution contained 30% (w/v) poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
3350, 0.1 M 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (MES)–NaOH (pH
6.5), and 0.2 M ammonium sulfate. Rod-shaped crystals grew to an approximate
size of 0.1 × 0.05 × 0.05 mm3.

In the case
of the Eg517–369–PVEI0021 complex, crystallization
conditions were almost the same as in the case of Eg517–369–PVEI0138. The protein–inhibitor solution contained
15.5 mg/mL (0.37 mM) Eg517–369, 2.0 mM PVEI0021
in buffer A, and 5% (w/v) sucrose. The reservoir solution contained
24–34% (w/v) PEG3350, 0.1 M MES–NaOH (pH 6.5), and 0.2
M ammonium sulfate. Two types of crystals appeared from almost the
same crystallization conditions: one belonged to space group P21 and the other to C2.

X-ray
Data Collection and Structure Determination
A
crystal of the Eg517–369–PVEI0138 complex
was cryoprotected in a solution containing 30% (w/v) sucrose, 34%
(w/v) PEG3350, 0.1 M MES–NaOH (pH 6.5), 0.2 M ammonium sulfate,
and buffer A and flash-frozen at 100 K. Each crystal of the Eg517–369–PVEI0021 complex belonging to P21 and C2 types was cryoprotected
in a solution containing 20% (w/v) sucrose, 34% (w/v) PEG3350, 0.1
M MES–NaOH (pH 6.5), 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, and buffer A and
flash-frozen at 100 K. All X-ray diffraction data were collected at
SPring-8 (Harima, Japan). Data from the Eg517–369–PVEI0138 and Eg517–369–PVEI0021
(P21 type) complexes were processed and
scaled with XDS41 and SCALA,42 and those from the Eg517–369–PVEI0021 complex (C2 type) were processed
and scaled with HKL2000.43

The structure
of the Eg517–369–PVEI0138 complex was determined
using a molecular replacement method with the program MOLREP44 in the CCP4 suite.45 The structure of the Eg51–368–STLC complex
(PDB code, 2WOG; chain A)19 was used as an initial model.
Structural refinement was performed with REFMAC546 and PHENIX,47 and manual model
fitting was achieved with Coot.48 The structures
of the Eg517–369–PVEI0021 complex (P21 and C2 types) were determined
using almost the same procedure as in the Eg517–369–PVEI0138 complex. Data collection and refinement statistics
are summarized in Table 1.

The least-squares fitting between the two structures was
performed
with PDBeFold32 using all of the residues.
Accessible surface areas were calculated with AREAIMOL in the CCP4
suite.45 The area and volume of surface
pockets were calculated with CASTp.35 The
shape complementarities of the interface between the Eg5 motor domain
and STLC-type inhibitors were calculated with Sc.36 All molecular figures were produced with PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org/).

Isothermal
Titration Calorimetry
Binding affinities
and thermal parameters of three inhibitors, STLC, PVEI0021, and PVEI0138,
to Eg517–369 were measured using ITC (MicroCal iTC200,
Malvern). The measurements were performed at 25 °C with a reference
power of 5 μcal/s. STLC (3 μL, 750 μM) in the syringe
was injected into 50 μM Eg517–369 in the cell,
and a total of 13 injections were performed. Similarly, 3 μL
of 120 μM PVEI0021 in the syringe was injected into 10 μM
Eg517–369 in the cell, and a total of 13 injections
were performed. Similarly, 2 μL (or 1.5 μL) of 120 μM
PVEI0138 in the syringe was injected into 10 μM Eg517–369 in the cell, and a total of 19 injections (or 25 injections) were
performed. Cell and syringe solutions were in the ITC buffer containing
50 mM PIPES–NaOH (pH 6.8), 0.4 M NaCl, 1 mM ADP, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA–NaOH, 1 mM TCEP–HCl, 5% (w/v) sucrose,
and 0.75% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. Parallel experiments were performed
by injecting each inhibitor into the ITC buffer, and then the heat
of dilution was controlled prior to fitting the data. Experiments
using the same conditions were all run in duplicate. ITC data were
analyzed using Origin software (MicroCal) and were fitted using a
one-site binding model.
