Knob-in-hole antibodies can be utilized
to introduce a single tag
for chemo-enzymatic functionalization. By either introducing a single
C-terminal sortase tag (sortase-tag expressed protein ligation) or
tyrosine tag (G4Y), mono-functionalization of the monoclonal
antibody trastuzumab was achieved rapidly and in high yields. This
method was applied to selectively and efficiently introduce a single
fluorescent tag, cytokine or single-chain variable fragment, as well
as produce clean homo dimers of trastuzumab.

1 Introduction
Chemical
conjugation of functional molecules to monoclonal antibodies
is widely applied in fields spanning from fundamental biology research
to targeted therapy. These applications include, but are not limited
to, cellular imaging,1,2 antibody–drug conjugates,3,4 and diagnostics.5 Common conjugation
strategies, based on side-chain modification of lysine or cysteine,
are straightforward and efficient but provide poor control of regioselectivity
and stoichiometry.6,7 With the expansion of the genetic
code to incorporate noncanonical amino acids, chemically orthogonal
handles can be introduced at predefined sites in a given protein sequence,8,9 which allows for chemoselective oxime ligation10 or click chemistry.11 In addition,
a wide arsenal of methods is available for site-specific protein modification
with varying degrees of versatility.12

Besides chemical strategies, enzymatic conjugations have emerged
recently, as they enable highly controlled modification of antibodies
through specific peptide tags.13 Examples
of enzymatic processes include sortase ligation,14,15 phosphopantetheinyl transferase,16 and
transglutaminase.17 Recently, we demonstrated
that selective labeling of monoclonal antibodies can be ensured in
a single step based on the introduction of a C-terminal tetra-glycyltyrosine
tag (G4Y, Figure 1A).18−20 Specifically, oxidation of the phenol moiety of the
tyrosine in the G4Y tag to an ortho-quinone
by mushroom tyrosinase (mTyr) and in situ Diels–Alder reaction
with bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN) leads to selective labeling in high
yields and under mild conditions, with reaction rates exceeding those
of the strain-promoted alkyne–azide cycloaddition by at least
a factor of 500. This strain-promoted oxidation-controlled ortho-quinone cycloaddition (SPOCQ) was subsequently shown
to also proceed with cyclopropenes, albeit significantly slower,21 or could be further accelerated by employing
cyclopropanated trans-cyclooctene.22

Given the symmetrical nature of
antibody, the site-specific methods
described above lead to dual labeling of the protein. However, in
some cases, forming a 2:1 antibody format (i.e., two antigen binding
sites and one conjugated molecule of interest) may be more desirable,
for example, in the generation of an antibody–drug conjugate
with an extremely potent cytotoxin such as a pyrrolobenzodiazepine
dimer23 or by radiolabeling with α-emitters
such as thorium-227.24 While these formats
have been reported, generation of these conjugates relies on approaches
with poor control of site and stoichiometry like random lysine conjugation
followed by isolation of the mono-functionalized conjugate,24 or required the rearrangement of several disulfide
bridges between the light and heavy chains (HCs), resulting in a significant
loss of binding activity and stability.23 Similarly, various antibody conjugates with a 2:1 format to enhance
the therapeutic window, e.g., with IL-225 and α-CD3,26 have been reported.
The latter conjugates were obtained by the fusion of an immunocytokine
or T-cell engager to a single chain of an asymmetric antibody format,
known as knob-in-hole (KiH) antibodies.27,28

By changing
only a few key amino acids in the CH3 domain that are
pivotal to the pairing of the heavy chains, i.e., replacing a small
side chain with a large side chain on one heavy chain (knob) and vice
versa for the other heavy chain (hole), heterodimerization can be
promoted.29,30 While the KiH technology has been applied
to create immunocytokines based on genetic encoding of a C-terminal
fusion protein on one of the heavy chains,25 a modular approach derived from a single engineered antibody scaffold
would allow for easy access to a wide range of mono-functional conjugates.

Here, we show that the knob-in-hole technology can be readily applied
for the generation of 2:1 antibody conjugates by selective strain-promoted
cycloaddition of a single heavy chain (HC) based on ortho-quinone chemistry or tetrazine ligation (Figure 1B). We found that this strategy is suitable
for the formation of antibody–small molecule, antibody–protein,
and antibody–antibody conjugates.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Two-Stage Antibody Conjugation
Based on Tetrazine
Ligation
A knob-in-hole variant of trastuzumab was generated
by the introduction of a single mutation in the “knob”
heavy chain (T366W; knob-HC) and three mutations in the “hole”
heavy chain (T366S, L368A, and Y407V; hole-HC).31 For conjugation, the hole-HC contained a C-terminal sortase
LPETG-tag (Supporting Information (SI)).14,31 After transient expression and subsequent purification by protein
A affinity chromatography, analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate- polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) confirmed
the existence of two distinct heavy chains (Figure 2A, SI). To facilitate
analysis of the Fc region of the antibody by LC-MS, it was deglycosylated
by endo S2 and digested below the hinge region by IdeS to generate
the Fc/2 and F(ab′)2 fragments.22,32 Following these steps, one of the heavy chains was found to have
a molecular weight of 25 565 Da, corresponding to the hole-HC
containing the sortase tag (calc.: 25 564 Da). The second peak,
corresponding to the knob-HC, was found to have a molecular weight
of 24 220 Da (calc.: 24 221 Da).

The KiH trastuzumab containing the sortase tag (abbreviated
as
Tras[KiH-HC]ST) was subjected to sortase-mediated ligation to introduce trans-cyclooctene (Tras[KiH-HC]TCO) or a methyltetrazine
moiety (Tras[KiH-HC]MeTz) for conjugation via inverse-electron demand
Diels–Alder (IEDDA), also known as tetrazine ligation.33 The products resulting from sortagging were
purified using protein A affinity column chromatography, after which
the HPLC analysis showed full conversion of the starting material
to the anticipated product with a single light chain and two distinct
heavy chains (Figure 2B,C). In the obtained chromatograms, the unmodified light chain and
knob-HC eluted at 6.47–6.50 and 7.66–7.67 min, respectively,
while elution of the hole-HC shifts from 7.51 min (sortase tag, A)
to 7.83 min (TCO-group, B) or 7.77 min (MeTz-group, C). The LC-MS
analysis confirmed the formation of the anticipated products, with
no observed sortase-mediated hydrolysis (SI).

With the mono-functionalized antibodies in hand, Tras[KiH-HC]TCO
was first reacted with a methyltetrazine-labeled fluorophore (MeTz-TAMRA).
As expected, SDS-PAGE analysis showed a slight upward shift for the
band corresponding to the hole-HC (Figure 3, lane 2), and the formation of a single
fluorescently labeled band could be identified (SI). The HPLC analysis displayed an efficiency exceeding 90%,
and LC-MS confirmed the formation of the desired hole-HC IEDDA product,
while the knob-HC remained unmodified (SI).

Figure 3 SDS-PAGE analysis of IEDDA reaction of Tras[KiH-HC]TCO with MeTz-TAMRA
(lane 2), MeTz–IL-2 (lane 3), and MeTz–UCHT1 (lane 5)
and Tras[KiH-HC]MeTz with BCN–lissamine (lane 8), TCO–IL-2
(lane 9), and TCO–UCHT1 (lane 11). Lanes M are loaded with
protein ladders, lanes 1 and 7 contain the unmodified KiH antibodies.

Next, we pursued the preparation
of monovalent antibody–protein
conjugates based on this strategy. In particular, we considered the
strategy for application in cancer immunotherapy by combining the
targeting power of a monoclonal antibody with cytokine IL-2 or an
α-CD3 T-cell engager. To this end, a MeTz moiety was attached
to the C-terminus of either the cytokine interleukin 2 (IL-2)14 or to the short-chain variable fragment to UCHT1
(α-CD3 scFv)34 or using sortase.
Subsequently, Tras[KiH-HC]TCO was incubated with an excess MeTz–IL-2
(Figure 3, lane 3)
or MeTz–UCHT1 (Figure 3, lane 5), resulting in either MeTz-functionalized protein
reacting with TCO-functionalized Tras[KiH-HC]TCO antibody. To be precise,
MeTz–IL-2 showed a clean labeling of the hole-HC, resulting
in the formation of a new band with the expected molecular weight
of ∼70 kDa, i.e., 50 kDa for the HC and 18 kDa for MeTz–IL-2.
The HPLC analysis showed full conversion of the TCO-labeled hole-HC,
which was confirmed by the LC-MS analysis (SI). Similarly, the reaction of Tras[KiH-HC]TCO with MeTz–UCHT1
showed a near full conversion to the expected 80 kDa band, with HPLC
and LC-MS confirming the efficient formation of the expected bifunctional
antibody via this method.

Having successfully demonstrated the
suitability of tetrazine ligation
for the generation of 2:1 antibody–protein conjugates, we also
explored the inverse tetrazine ligation strategy. Thus, Tras[KiH-HC]MeTz
was subjected to conjugation with either small-molecule fluorophore
BCN–lissamine (Figure 3, lane 8 and the SI), TCO–IL-2
(Figure 3, lane 9),
or TCO–UCHT1 (Figure 3, lane 11). In all cases, the desired mono-functionalized
antibody was successfully conjugated on the desired hole-HC, and the
formation of the fluorophore-, IL-2-, and UCHT1-conjugates on Tras[KiH-HC]MeTz
were confirmed by LC-MS (SI). Interestingly,
SDS-PAGE shows that the conversion is significantly cleaner when compared
to the Tras[KiH-HC]TCO MeTz–protein combination. A potential
explanation for the lower conjugation efficiency of the TCO-modified
antibody may be due to in situ isomerization of the trans-alkene in TCO caused by the cysteine thiol in the active site of
sortase A.35 In this light, having the
MeTz on the antibody and the TCO/BCN on the reactive protein partner
is clearly the preferred strategy for antibody–protein conjugates.

Finally, we explored the potential of the two-stage protocol of
sortagging–tetrazine ligation for the controlled formation
of functionally homogeneous antibody dimers. To this end, Tras[KiH-HC]MeTz
was incubated with Tras[KiH-HC]TCO in a 1.5:1 ratio. The rationale
for the latter strategy was based on our finding that excess tetrazine-modified
antibody could be conveniently removed by capturing with TCO-modified
agarose beads, leading to clean antibody dimers (SI). Utilization of the modularity of these antibodies allows
for the straightforward production of dimeric antibodies with good
conversion and high purity, and offers a viable chemical alternative
for known methods that require the expression of fusion proteins36,37 or are based on chemical approaches yielding highly heterogeneous
antibody dimers.38

2.2 Direct
Conjugation Based on Ortho-Quinone Chemistry
Besides the two-step method that combines
sortagging with MeTz or TCO followed by tetrazine ligation, the possibility
of direct labeling of knob-in-hole antibodies with SPOCQ chemistry
was investigated next. SPOCQ (strain-promoted oxidation-controlled ortho-quinone cycloaddition) was originally developed based
on the chemical generation of ortho-quinones.18 Recently, we showed it can be conveniently applied
in a one-pot process involving the oxidation of a tyrosine side chain
to an ortho-quinone by the action of mushroom tyrosinase
(mTyr), followed by in situ reaction with a BCN-bearing probe by (4
+ 2) cycloaddition to form a stable product (Figure 4B).19

Scheme of the SPOCQ reaction of an oxidized tyrosine side-chain functionality

of SPOCQ between Tras[KiH-HC]G4Y and BCN–lissamine.
(D) Mass spectra of Tras[KiH-HC]G4Y (top) and its SPOCQ
product with BCN–lissamine (bottom). (E) Mass spectrum of Tras[KiH-HC]UCHT1
as formed by SPOCQ.

Earlier we described
that SPOCQ on the symmetrical antibody Tras[HC]G4Y converts
to 95% of the desired bis-functionalized adducts
when small fluorophores were conjugated.22 However, this level of conversion could not be achieved when protein–protein
conjugation was attempted on symmetrical G4Y-tagged heavy-chain
antibodies (SI). Presumably, the second
ligation is sterically hindered, leading to intramolecular side reactions
of the in situ generated, highly reactive ortho-quinone
intermediate with nucleophilic side chains of amino acids such as
lysine and histidine.39 However, we anticipated
that a single SPOCQ conjugation event on a KiH antibody would not
suffer from incomplete conjugation. In addition, direct SPOCQ would
offer the opportunity to eliminate the sortase-mediated step, as an
exposed tyrosine moiety can be readily engineered at the C-terminus
of any protein.

Thus, a knob-in-hole antibody with the same
four mutations as described
above was expressed bearing a single C-terminal G4Y tag
(Tras[KiH-HC]G4Y; Figure 4A). The antibody showed three distinct peaks on HPLC
corresponding to the two different heavy chains and the light chain.
Similar to our earlier approach, SPOCQ was first performed on Tras[KiH-HC]G4Y with BCN–lissamine, and subsequent HPLC analysis
showed >95% conversion of G4Y-HC within 20 min (Figure 4C), significantly
faster than 90 min required for the dual labeling of symmetrical Tras[HC]G4Y as reported earlier.22

Analogous to Tras[KiH-HC]ST, the knob-HC was found to have a molecular
weight of 24 221 Da (calc. Mw:
24 221 Da) and 24 349 Da for the hole-HC containing
the G4Y moiety (calc. Mw: 24 350
Da) (Figure 4D). After
SPOCQ, the molecular weight of the hole-HC increased from 879 to 25 229
Da (calc. Mw: 25 229 Da). This
corresponds to the addition of 14 Da during the oxidation by mTyr
and addition of 865 Da by BCN–lissamine.

Finally, we
explored the suitability of Tras[KiH-HC]G4Y for the generation
of protein–protein conjugates. SDS-page
(SI) and LC-MS analysis showed the formation
of trastuzumab-UCHT1 conjugates by the SPOCQ conjugation of Tras[KiH-HC]G4Y (Figure 4E). Two masses were found by LC-MS: the first being 52 351
Da (calc. Mw: 52 351 Da), corresponding
to the hole-HC plus 14 Da for oxidation by mTyr and the addition of
BCN–UCHT1 (calc. Mw: 27 987.0
Da), and the second peak is 53 448 Da, corresponding to the
same conjugate with incomplete deglycosylation by endo S2, corresponding
to a G0F glycan (calc. Mw:
53 446 Da).

3 Conclusions
We have
successfully developed a modular approach to site-selectively
mono-functionalize one heavy chain of an antibody. Using asymmetrical
knob-in-hole antibodies, a single peptide tag was readily introduced
for chemo-enzymatic functionalization of one heavy chain by an indirect
approach using sortase or by direct labeling with SPOCQ. Subsequently,
the method was shown to allow for the rapid and selective introduction
of a single fluorophore, a cytokine, or an scFv on the antibody. Additionally,
highly efficient dimerization of monoclonal antibodies was achieved,
which would allow for the production of clean bispecific antibodies
in a modular fashion and with high conversions. The interest in these
bispecific antibodies have increased significantly over the last years,
since bispecific antibodies can directly target immune cells to tumors,40 with many of them in clinical trials.41 With SPOCQ, near-quantitative conversions are
obtained after only 20 min of reaction time. We envision this modular
approach may open up possibilities for new and potent therapeutic
agents. Comparison of our technology with the established fusion formats
for making such bioconjugates should reveal if our current method
is, indeed, a viable chemical alternative to the more established
biological methods.

4.3 Sortase
Reaction
Generally, Tras[KIH-HC]ST
was constituted as a 10 mg/mL in TBS pH 8.0. Typical reaction conditions
were as follows: 100 μL of 10 mg/mL Tras[KIH-HC]ST (7.35 mg/mL
final concentration), 10 μL of 17 mg/mL sortase A in TBS pH

BCN–lissamine in DMSO or BCN–UCHT1 in PBS was added
in excess of 3–10 times and cooled to 4 °C. Finally, mTyr
(10.0 mg/mL) in phosphate buffer pH 6.0 (50 mM phosphate) was added
to obtain an antibody concentration of 5–6 mg/mL.20 The sample was set to react for 30 min.

4.5 IEDDA Reaction
In a typical experiment,
Tras[KiH-HC]MeTz (2.0–4.0 mg/mL) was constituted in the PBS
buffer (pH 7.2) and 2–5 equiv of label (e.g., BCN–lissamine
in DMSO, TCO–UCHT1 in PBS pH 7.2) was added. The sample was
set to react for 30 min.

4.6 Protein A Affinity Chromatography
For >1 mg of antibody, the antibody was purified by Hitrap protein
A HP (ProtA) column (5 mL, run at 5 mL/min) on an Agilent 1260 Preparative
HPLC. The ProtA column was pre-equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate
pH 7.0; the antibody was applied to the column and washed with 10
column volumes of 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0. The product, which
was eluted with 5 column volumes of 0.1 M citric acid pH 3.0, was
obtained in 5 mL fractions and diluted with 1 mL of 1.0 Tris buffer
of pH 9.0 each. The product fractions were concentrated and the buffer
exchanged to the specified buffer. For <1 mg of antibody, NAb Protein
A Plus Spin Columns (0.2 mL) were used for the purification of the
antibody. Purification was performed exactly as stated in the manual.
After the purification, the product fractions were concentrated and
buffer exchanged with Amicon ultraspin filtration units (50 kDa MWCO)
to PBS. The concentration was determined using Thermo Fisher Scientific
NanoDrop 2000.

4.7 SDS-PAGE Gel Preparation
Twelve percent
acrylamide gels were prepared according to bio-rad bulletin 6201 protocol.
Afterward, the gels were stained using coommassie brilliant blue (0.1%
Coomassie Blue R250 in 10% acetic acid, 50% methanol, and 40% demineralized
water) for 0.5 h and destained with destaining solution (10% acetic
acid, 50% methanol, and 40% demineralized water) for 1 h. Afterward,
the destaining solvent was replaced with water and shaken gently overnight
at room temperature.

4.8 SDS-PAGE Sample Preparation
After
the indicated reaction time had expired, 2.5 μg of antibody
in 2.5 μL of PBS buffer was incubated with 2.5 μL of SDS-PAGE
sample buffer (2×) including 5% BME for 5 min at 95 °C.
The denatured sample was then applied for SDS-PAGE analysis (12% acrylamide
gel).20

Precision Plus Protein Dual
Color Standards was used as a reference protein ladder.

4.9 HPLC Sample Preparation
Prior to
HPLC analysis, the samples were diluted with 0.1 M Tris pH 8.0 to
contain 10 μg of antibody in 10 μL of solution. Afterward,
5 μL of 0.2 M DTT in 0.1 M Tris pH 8.0 was added and the sample
was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Next, 30 μL of MMF was
added to the mixture.20

Reverse-phase
HPLC was performed on a Agilent 1220 HPLC Infinity using a Thermo
Fisher Scientific MAbPac reversed phase (RP) column (3.0 × 50
mm2, 4 μm) column run at 0.6 mL/min at 80 °C
using a 10 min linear gradient from 20 to 45% buffer B (with buffer
A = 95% Milli-Q, 5% MeCN, 0.1% TFA and buffer B = 95% MeCN, 5% Milli-Q,
0.1% TFA).

4.10 LC-MS Sample Preparation
As reported
earlier,20,22 trastuzumab can be denatured with DTT or
FabRICATOR (IdeS) before analyzing by LC-MS.44 DTT would denature all thiols, resulting in light and heavy chains.
However, FabRICATOR hydrolyzes the antibody just below the hinge region
(..CPAPELLG/GPSVF..) without reducing the disulfide bridges, resulting
in 2 Fc fragments of about 25 kDa containing the glycan chain and
a F(ab′)2 region of about 96 kDa. For LC-MS, the samples were
treated with GlycINATOR and subsequently FabRICATOR, unless stated
otherwise.

The samples were analyzed on a Thermo Finningan Surveyor
HPLC system with a ThermoScientific MAbPac reversed phase (RP) (3.0
× 50 mm2, 4 μm) column, coupled to a Thermo
Fisher Scientific Q-Exactive Focus Orbitrap. Analysis was performed
with a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min at 80 °C using a 10 min linear
gradient from 20 to 45% buffer B (with buffer A = 95% Milli-Q, 5%
acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid (FA) and buffer B = 95% acetonitrile,
5% Milli-Q, 0.1% FA). If IL-2 was present in the mixture, the gradient
was altered to a 10 min linear gradient from 20 to 45% buffer B, after
which a 6 min linear gradient from 45 to 100% buffer B was applied.

Afterward, the chromatograms were analyzed using a Thermo Xcalibur
Qual browser, exported to text files, and deconvoluted using UniDec
software.45

4.11 DTT
Prior to HPLC analysis, 0.2
M DTT solution in 0.1 M Tris pH 8.0 was freshly prepared. Antibody
samples were diluted to 1 μg/μL antibody and 2.5 μL
of DTT stock solution was added per 10 μg of antibody. The mixture
was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to reduce the interchain disulfide
bonds, after which the reaction was quenched by adding 30 μL
of a mixture of 49:49:2 (v/v/v) Milli-Q/MeCN/FA per 10 μg of
antibody.

4.12 GlycINATOR (endo S2)
Trastuzumab
was reduced by incubating a solution of 20 μg of antibody in
PBS pH 7.2 with 10 μL of 2 U/μL GlycINATOR for 1 h at
37 °C.

4.13 FabRICATOR (IdeS)
Trastuzumab was
reduced by incubating a solution of 20 μg of antibody in PBS
pH 7.2 with 1 μL of 20 U/μL FabRICATOR for 1 h at 37 °C.
