supramolecular framework containing both left-
and right-handed helixes, {[Zn(TTPA)Cl2]·1.63H2O}n (1), has been
converted to a novel octanuclear cluster containing a metal–organic
framework, [Zn8(ptptp)6Cl2](ClO4)2·4CH3OH·2H2O

Introduction
Metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) are becoming a well-known
subset of materials science and chemical research.1 The main features of MOFs that make them so highly studied
are their tailored properties resulting from their regular structures
and high crystallinity.2 These properties
make MOFs well suited for the fields of gas storage and separation,3 sensing,4 and catalysis,5 alongside biomimetic applications.6 One particular MOF phenomenon, single-crystal
to single-crystal (SC–SC) transformations, is becoming increasingly
well studied as it allows for the ability to incorporate the functional
groups and metal centers into crystallographically exact locations
within the MOF, allowing the resulting structure to achieve properties
that are often difficult to induce in an MOF solvothermally.4c,4d,7 Typically, the mild conditions
of SC–SC transformations do not alter the structure of the
MOF; however, rearrangements in the coordination environments of metal
ions and ligands have been observed.8 Additionally,
the SC–SC transformation allows for the crystallographic structural
determination of chemical species that are often difficult to be produced
in solution phase.9 Because of this, the
SC–SC transformation allows for the generation of novel coordination
assemblies with unique reactivities, something that can be of great
use in areas such as catalysis or separations.10 In particular, SC–SC transformations are ideally
suited for the generation of novel multimetallic assemblies, as solvothermal
syntheses containing multiple metal species typically result in a
mixture of multiple phases, or could potentially require cumbersome
multistep pathways. In this work, we chose a known ligand, TTPA, and
investigated its three-dimensional (3D) supramolecular framework,
{[Zn(TTPA)Cl2]·1.63H2O}n (1) (TTPA = tris(4-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)phenyl)amine).
The 3D network is interesting because it has both left- and right-handed
helixes. Structure 1 contains only water as the lattice
guests, which suggested the possibility that H2O could
be replaced by other solvents. The irreversible and distinct SC–SC
transformation triggered by solvent exchange afforded {[Zn(TTPA)Cl2]·0.5CH3OH·H2O}n (1a). More interestingly, under hydrothermal
conditions, 1 yielded a novel discrete octanuclear ZnII cluster, [Zn8(ptptp)6Cl2](ClO4)2·4CH3OH·2H2O (ptptp = 2-(5-(6-(5-(pyridin-2-yl)-4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)pyridin-2-yl)-4H-1,2,4-riazol-3-yl)pyridine) (1b), through
an in situ reaction and unusual geometric arrangement. In fact, this
result is the first example of switching the dimensionality of a framework
via an in situ reaction triggering ligand rearrangement. Investigation
into its luminescent properties indicates that 1b represents
the first example of a triazole-based material with selective recognition
toward Pb2+ and Cr2O72–.

Results and Discussion
Structure Description
Supramolecular
complex 1 crystallized in the monoclinic space group P21/n (Table 1). Within the asymmetric unit of 1, one ZnII ion, one TTPA ligand, and two Cl– anions were observed (Figure 1a). The ZnII ion adopts a distorted tetrahedral
coordination geometry, which is defined by two Cl– anions alongside two Ntriazole atoms. The Zn–Cl
bond distances fall within the 2.2250(7)–2.2413(7) Å range,
and the variance within the Zn–N distances are from 2.012(2)
to 2.019(2) Å. All of the bond distances are within the normal
range for zinc complexes.12 The alternating
connectivity of the ZnII ions and the TTPA ligands gives
rise to an infinite one-dimensional (1D) chain expanding along the b axis. The formation of helixes is due to the flexibility
between the triazole and benzene rings in TTPA. The dihedral angles
of the three triazole rings compared to their neighboring benzene
rings are 5.2°, 18.4°, and 21.9°. The ZnII centers are linked by two of the triazole groups on TTPA, forming
a 1D Zn-TTPA helical chain, which runs along the 21 screw
axis in the b direction, whose pitch is 24.241(1)
Å (Figure 1b).
In the crystal structure, chains with the same chirality stack by
the a axis (Figure 1c), while along the c axis, the chains
alternate chirality. This chain altering structure forms a porous
3D supramolecular framework with free-water molecules sitting in the
cavities (Figure 1d).

Inspired by studies on
SC–SC transformations,131 was immersed in CH3OH, yielding orange-yellow crystals
of 1a. X-ray structural
analysis revealed that 1a and 1 are isostructural
only with the addition of a half equivalent of methanol in the asymmetric
unit of 1a (Figure S1a). Similar
to 1, ZnII ions are coordinated with the two
Ntriazole atoms from TTPA and two Cl– ions; however, the Zn–N bond distances instead ranged from
2.016(3) to 2.020(3) Å while the Zn–Cl bonds ranged from
2.2336(12) to 2.2516(13) Å. For the μ2-bridged
TTPA ligand in 1a, the dihedral angle between the benzene
and triazole rings are 5.5° and 19.4° in the helical chains
and 21.5° for others. The alternating linkage of ZnII and TTPA results in a slightly larger pitch of 24.401(10) Å
between the chiral chains as compared to 1. We are currently
interested in the effect of solvents on the topological configuration
of helical networks, as they can tune the dihedral angle between the
aromatic rings and the pitch of the self-assembled helical spring.
The central projection of the 3D supramolecular structure (Figure S1b) shows that the methanol and water
molecules lie in the voids between the neighboring chains.

It
is interesting to note that when 1, NaClO4·H2O, and CH3OH were added into a 25 mL
Teflon vessel under autogenous pressure and heated at 150 °C
for 3 days, 1b was obtained. The discrete octanuclear
complex 1b was obtained because of the in situ generation
of the ligand ptptp.14 To the best of our
knowledge, 1b is the first observed example of this type
of in situ ligand generation from TTPA to ptptp. Single-crystal X-ray
analysis indicated that 1b crystallizes in the monoclinic
space group and the C2/c crystal
system. The asymmetric unit is composed of four ZnII ions,
three ptptp ligands, one Cl– anion, one ClO4– anion, two methanol molecules, and one
water molecule. It was observed that there are in fact two different
ZnII coordination modes in 1b. Zn2 is situated
in a distorted octahedral coordination environment ligated by six
N atoms from three distinct ptptp ligands while Zn1, Zn3, and Zn4
exhibited a distorted square pyramidal geometry. Their geometry consists
of four Nptptp atoms and one μ3-Cl atom
(Figure 2a). All Zn–N
bonds range from 2.173(5) to 2.515(5) Å, with the Zn–Cl
bonds ranging from 2.399(2) to 2.3974(18)Å, both of which are
longer than those of 1 and 1a.

Ptptp is a hepta-dentate ligand which ligated the three Zn
atoms,
forming an isolated fanlike {Zn8(ptptp)6Cl2} cluster (Figure 2b). An octanuclear cluster building unit has been previously
observed in the Mn2+ and Cd2+ analogues.13a The octanuclear ZnII moieties can
be defined as a bicapped trigonal antiprism polyhedron, as shown in Figure 2c. The Zn1, Zn3,
and Zn4 atoms are connected by μ3-Cl in an approximately
planar triangular geometry. The triangles of Zn1–Zn3–Zn4
and Zn1A–Zn3A–Zn4A serve as the top and bottom planes
of the antiprism with the remaining Zn2 and Zn2A being the up and
down of the triangular faces, respectively. The adjacent Zn atoms
are linked through the triazole rings of the ptptp ligands in the
manner of Zn1–N–N–Zn4A, Zn4–N–N–Zn1A,
Zn3–N–N–Zn3A, and Zn(1/3/4)–N–N–Zn2.
The distance between the two Zn atoms in two triangular planes is
4.47 Å with the mean distance between the cap Zn and the neighbor
in the triangular plane is 4.63 Å. The dihedral angles between
the pyridine rings and the triazole rings are in the range of 1.9–38.5°.
Each Zn atom coordinates with three ptptp ligands and the whole {Zn8(ptptp)6Cl2} cluster is surrounded by
six ptptp ligands, as indicated in Figure 2d. The stacking of the {Zn8(ptptp)6Cl2} clusters gives rise to the final structure
(Figure 2e), with ClO4–, methanol, and water molecules being dispersed
throughout the {Zn8(ptptp)6Cl2} clusters,
balancing the electrical charges and stabilizing 1b.

Luminescence Properties
Hexavalent chromium Cr(VI)
is extensively utilized in industrial applications such as paint production,
leather tanning, and steel manufacturing, which has resulted in extensive
amounts of Cr(VI) environmental pollution.15 In particular, the U.S. Environment Protection Agency (EPA) considers
Cr2O72– as a group “A”
human carcinogen for its mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and teratogenicity
in the human body.16 Another known environmental
contaminant, lead(II), is also known to have severe effects on the
environment as well as human health.17 Lead
accumulation within the body can lead to reproductive, neurological,
cardiovascular, and developmental disorders.18 Currently, atomic absorption spectrometry and inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry are used for detecting lead(II) ions, but
they typically require complex procedures or equipment which makes
them unsuitable for on-site analyses. Fluorescent detection is gradually
becoming a promising Cr2O72– and Pb2+ detection strategy because of its operational
simplicity, minimal cost, on-site monitoring capabilities, and high
selectivity. Therefore, fluorescent probes for the selective determination
of Cr2O72– and Pb2+ concentrations are highly sought after.

As shown in Figure 3a, TTPA is luminescent
in dimethylformamide (DMF) at ambient temperatures, exhibiting a broad
emission maximum at λem,max = 320 nm. A red shift
occurs to compounds 1a and 1b compared with
TTPA. The exhibited red-shifted results in relatively strong green
and yellow fluorescent emission bands at λ = 597 and 525 nm,
respectively (Figure 3b). The major emission bands of TTPA and 1a show a similar
band shape. The band shape of the two components can neither be classified
as neither metal-to-ligand charge transfer nor ligand-to-metal charge
transfer. The most likely result is from the intraligand fluorescent
emission, something which is also observed for the free TTPA ligand
in DMF.13a,13b In comparison with the free ligand fluorescent
emissions and 1a in solution, 1b is both
narrow and red-shifted. The aromatic rings of TTPA within 1b lead
to the chromophores, with the observed emission due to the π
→ π* transition.

(1 × 10–4 mol L–1). (b) Emission
spectra of 1a and 1b in DMF solution at
room temperature (1 × 10–4 mol L–1). Black, 1a; red, 1b.

Complex 1b was soaked in aqueous solutions containing
different anions (F–, Cl–, Br–, I–, SO42–, ClO4–, CO32–, BF4–, NO3–, Cr2O72–, NO2–, and OAc–). The luminescent
measurements show that the different anions greatly influence the
luminescent intensity of 1b. Remarkably, Cr2O72– has the largest quenching effect
of the studied anions (Figure 4a). Although several reports on MOF-based anion exchange have
been reported, there are few examples on the capture of pollutant
anions with luminescent ZnII complexes.19 This unique feature resulted in further studies on the
capture capacity of 1b toward Cr2O72–.

Figure 4 (a) Photoluminescent spectra of 1b treated
with aqueous
solutions (10–2 M) of the anions F–, Cl–, Br–, I–, NO2–, ClO4–, SO42–, CO32–, BF4–, NO3–, Cr2O72–, and OAc–. (b) UV/vis spectra of with K2Cr2O7 in the channels of 1b at room temperature (mol/mol: 1b/K2Cr2O7 = 2:1). (c) Photoluminescent
spectra of 1b during the K2Cr2O7 inclusion process within the cavity of 1b at
room temperature.

At room temperature,
0.01 mmol 1b was placed into
an aqueous solution containing 0.005 mmol of K2Cr2O7 and the mixture was stirred continuously. The solution
was evaluated by taking liquid UV/vis spectroscopic analysis at certain
intervals. The absorption intensity of the main band of Cr2O72–, around λ = 333 nm, showed
a distinct decrease over time,20 thus demonstrating
that Cr2O72– ions were gradually
included into the channels of 1b. By soaking 1b for 12 h in a solution of K2Cr2O7, the UV/vis absorption intensity of the Cr2O72– ions remained almost unchanged, corresponding
to a concentration decrease of about 29.7% (Figure 4b). The luminescent intensity of 1b gradually decreased during the guest incorporation process, which
corresponded to the quenching effect of Cr2O72– (Figure 4c).

Upon adding 1–3 equiv of Pb2+ (1
× 10–3, 2 × 10–3, and
3 × 10–3 M), the emission intensity of 1b increases
significantly with respect to 1b. The peak at 525 nm
is about four times as intense as the corresponding band in the absence
of Pb2+. The same experiments were performed with Ni2+, Mg2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, and
Ca2+ ions to clarify the Pb2+ results. The emission
intensity gradually decreased in the presence of 1–3 equiv
of these ions, except for Ni2+, the emission intensity
of which stayed mostly unchanged (Figure 5). To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first report of a triazole-based octanuclear cluster being used
as a selective luminescent probe for Pb2+ and Cr2O72–.

Conclusions
A porous 3D supramolecular framework containing
right- and left-hand
helixes has transformed into an octanuclear cluster through a ligand
rearrangement induced by solvothermal conditions. The resulting octanuclear
ZnII complex has been demonstrated as a selective sensor
toward Pb2+ and Cr2O72–.

Experimental Section
General Remarks
All the reagents
were commercially
available and used without further purification. The elemental analysis
of carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen was performed on a PerkinElmer 240
elemental analyzer. The photoluminescence spectra were recorded by
an MPF-4 fluorescence spectrophotometer with a xenon arc lamp as the
light source. The powder sample was soaked in aqueous solutions containing
various anions (F–, Cl–, Br–, I–, SO42–, ClO4–, CO32–, BF4–, NO3–, Cr2O72–, NO2–, and OAc–), giving the resultant
turbid liquid for direct luminescence measurement.
