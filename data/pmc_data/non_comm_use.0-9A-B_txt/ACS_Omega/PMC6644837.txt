ε-LiVOPO4 is a promising multielectron cathode
material for Li-ion batteries that can accommodate two electrons per
vanadium, leading to higher energy densities. However, poor electronic
conductivity and low lithium ion diffusivity currently result in low
rate capability and poor cycle life. To enhance the electrochemical
performance of ε-LiVOPO4, in this work, we optimized
its solid-state synthesis route using in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction
and applied a combination of high-energy ball-milling with electronically
and ionically conductive coatings aiming to improve bulk and surface
Li diffusion. We show that high-energy ball-milling, while reducing
the particle size also introduces structural disorder, as evidenced
by 7Li and 31P NMR and X-ray absorption spectroscopy.
We also show that a combination of electronically and ionically conductive
coatings helps to utilize close to theoretical capacity for ε-LiVOPO4 at C/50 (1 C = 153 mA h g–1) and to enhance
rate performance and capacity retention. The optimized ε-LiVOPO4/Li3VO4/acetylene black composite yields
the high cycling capacity of 250 mA h g–1 at C/5
for over 70 cycles.

Introduction
Since
their introduction in the 1970s, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)
have become the indispensable portable power supply for many applications.1−5 The market for LIBs has been rapidly growing with increasing demands
for electric vehicles and portable information technology devices.
However, the current materials are still limited in capacity and energy
density. For example, the layered oxide cathode materials, LiMO2 (M = Mn, Co, and Ni), which have been extensively studied
since LiCoO2 was first described in 19806 and commercialized by Sony in 1991, deliver only ∼180
mA h g–1 out of the theoretical capacity of over
270 mA h g–1.7,8 A common alternative,
the olivine phosphate LiFePO4, has even lower theoretical
capacity of about 170 mA h g–1.9 A feature common to these two classes of materials is that
they involve one electron per transition metal and complete delithiation
is often not achieved. To increase the chemical energy stored, a multielectron
redox reaction would be preferred. Recently, researchers have reported
ε-LiVOPO4 (LVPO) as a promising multielectron material
to incorporate two electrons.10−17 The two redox couples in this material, V3+/V4+ and V4+/V5+, enable two Li ions to be reversibly
inserted/extracted at about 2.5 and 4 V, leading to a high theoretical
capacity of 305 mA h g–1 (1030 mA h cm–3) based on the weight of Li2VOPO4.

The
development of LVPO electrodes must address the inherently
poor electronic conductivity and low lithium ion diffusivity,16,18 which can cause polarization and poor utilization. To overcome these
challenges, we explore nanosizing and carbon coating as used previously
for the LiFePO4 cathode,7,19−22 as well as modification of the particle surface by coating with
a lithium-ion conductor. Reducing the particle size shortens the Li-ion
diffusion length. In some cases, it can also change the reaction mechanism,
as in LiFePO4 going from two-phase to single-phase reaction
upon nanosizing.23,24 High-energy ball-milling (HEBM)
is one approach to reduce the particle size.25 The aggressive nature of HEBM can also modify Li ion migration channels
by introducing disorder, which was found to improve the electrochemical
performance of the related LiFePO4 cathode.26 An electronically conductive carbon coating
on this nanosized LVPO addresses the poor electronic conductivity
of this material. The method of coating and the choice of carbon source
are critical in providing a good conductive film without reducing
LVPO.27−30 Third, an ionically conductive coating enhances Li-ion transport
from the electrolyte to the active material, which can reduce charge-transfer
resistance and therefore improve the electrochemical performance of
LIBs.31 We identified the fast ionic conductor
Li3VO4 (LVO) as a suitable coating layer;32−35 this has been successfully used to improve the electrochemical performance
of several cathode materials,36 including
layered oxides LiCoO2,37,38 Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2,39 Li1.18Co0.15Ni0.15Mn0.52O2,40 LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2,41 and the phosphate LiMnPO4.42

In this study, we combined in situ and ex situ X-ray
diffraction
(XRD) and 7Li and 31P NMR, along with X-ray
absorption and photoemission spectroscopies and scanning and transmission
electron microscopies to understand the formation mechanism of LVPO,
the structural and morphological changes upon HEBM, and the nature
of carbon and LVO coatings. We optimized each of the three processes
to achieve significantly improved capacity, rate capability, and cycling
stability.

Experimental Methods
LVPO Synthesis
The pristine LVPO
was prepared by a
solid-state method using Li2CO3 (Sigma-Aldrich,
≥99.0%), NH4VO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%),
and NH4H2PO4 (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.99%)
as starting materials. The starting materials were weighed in a stoichiometric
ratio of Li/V/P = 1:1:1 and planetary ball-milled (Across International,
PQ-N04) in acetone for 4 h. The dried solid powder was pressed into
pellets and heated at 300 °C for 5 h in an argon atmosphere to
remove ammonia. The solid mixture was then heated again in an argon
atmosphere at 800 °C for 10 h.

High-Energy Ball-Milling
The as-synthesized LVPO was
high-energy ball-milled (SPEX, 8000D) for 0.2–0.7 h with Super
P carbon (Timcal). Two big balls (8 g each) and six small balls (1
g each) were used to grind the active material. The samples are named
HEBM 0.2 h, HEBM 0.3 h, HEBM 0.4 h, HEBM 0.5 h, HEBM 0.6 h, and HEBM
0.7 h, respectively.

Carbon Additives
Graphite (Aldrich,
<20 μm,
synthetic), Super P carbon (Timcal), acetylene black (Alfa Aesar,
100% compressed, 99.9+%), and graphene nanoplatelets (xGnP, grade
C, 750 m2 g–1) were used as carbon additives,
named as GP, SP, AB, and GN, respectively. The electronic conductivity
of the pressed pellets of the four carbon sources was measured by
Keithley 2400 sourcemeter.

Surface Coating
LVO was synthesized
by a hydrothermal
method. NH4VO3 (4 mmol) (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%)
and 70 mmol LiOH·H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥98.0%)
were dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water, then transferred into
a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, and kept in an oven at 180 °C
for 2 h. A mechanothermal method was used to coat LVO on the as-synthesized
LVPO. LVPO was mixed with LVO (10:1 weight ratio) in deionized water
and kept at 90 °C with vigorous stirring for 6 h; then, the mixture
was left open to evaporate the water. Subsequently, the dried powder
was sintered at 300, 400, 500, 600, and 700 °C for 3 h in air
to produce the LVPO/LVO composite. The intrinsic ionic conductivity
(σi) and electronic conductivity (σe) of LVO were measured by four-probe dc method together with ac technique
of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis by using
blocking electrodes. (Full details in Supporting Information).

Electrochemistry
The electrode materials
were prepared
by mixing the high-energy ball-milled active material with the carbon
additive and poly(vinylidene difluoride) (75:15:10 wt %). The slurry
was cast on Al foil and dried at 80 °C in a vacuum oven overnight.
The electrodes, with a 2–4 mg cm–2 loading
of active materials, were assembled into 2325-type coin cells with
a lithium metal chip and 1 M LiPF6 liquid electrolyte in
EC/DMC (EC/DMC = 1:1). All electrochemical performances were measured
on a VMP multichannel potentiostat (Bio-Logic). Charge–discharge
tests were measured in the voltage window of 1.6–4.5 V. Cyclic
voltammetry (CV) tests were carried out at a scan rate of 0.02 mV
s–1. EIS experiments were carried out over the frequency
range of 100 kHz to 1 mHz. The specific capacity was based on the
weight of LVPO in the composite electrode.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
and Transmission Electron Microscopy
Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) was performed on a Zeiss Supra
55VP microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging and
selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) were carried out on JEOL
2100F.

In Situ Synchrotron XRD and Lab XRD
To determine the
optimized solid-state synthesis temperature of LVPO, in situ high-temperature
synchrotron XRD (λ = 0.72768 Å) data were collected at
beamline 17-BM-B at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory.
The precursors were preheated ex situ at 300 °C under argon gas
flow. Then, the solid mixture was loaded into a quartz glass capillary
for in situ synchrotron XRD study. The sample was heated from 25 to
800 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 under argon gas flow and held at 800 °C for 2 h. All other
powder XRD tests were carried out on our lab instrument (Bruker, D8
ADVANCE, with Cu Kα radiation). All XRD profile fitting and
Rietveld refinement were implemented in the TOPAS program of Bruker.
The crystallite size and strain effects on the peak broadening were
analyzed using the Double-Voigt approach based on convolutions of
the fitted whole XRD patterns. This approach yields volume-weighted
mean crystallite sizes LVol-IB and
a mean strain value e0.43

X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy
X-ray photoemission
spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a Phi VersaProbe 5000 system.
The pristine LVPO, LVO, and coated sample LVPO/LVO were mounted on
Ta foil using conductive tape to obtain good electrical contact. The
sample handling and mounting was done in an He-filled glovebox, and
samples were transported in an inert atmosphere using a vacuum suitcase
to the XPS chamber, where they were immediately transferred to the
load lock and pumped down. Four different spots on the surface of
LVPO/LVO were measured to investigate uniformity of the coating, named
as LVPO/LVO S1, S2, S3, and S4.

X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
Samples for X-ray absorption
spectroscopy (XAS) were prepared by mixing ∼10 mg of the ball-milled
materials with graphite and pressing into pellets. XAS experiments
were carried out in the transmission mode at the V K-edge of LVPO
with various ball-milling times. The measurements were carried out
at the beamline 9-BM-B of Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National
Lab. The beamline is equipped with an Si(111) double-crystal monochromator.
Absolute energy calibration of the monochromator was carried out by
measuring a reference foil of pure V simultaneously with the sample.
Higher harmonics were suppressed by detuning the monochromator. The
intensities of the incident beam and the beam transmitted through
the sample and the reference foil were measured using gas-filled ionization
chambers. The sample chamber was purged with He gas to minimize X-ray
scattering. All spectra were energy-calibrated with respect to the
first peak in the derivative spectrum of the pure V reference foil.
Data processing was carried out using the software ATHENA of the package
IFEFFIT.44 The normalized component of
the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) oscillation was
transformed to k-space (i.e., wavenumber). The resultant
χ(k) was multiplied by k3 to emphasis the signal at high-k, then Fourier-transformed,
and left uncorrected for a phase shift.

Solid-State NMR
7Li and 31P NMR
spectra were acquired at a magic angle spinning (MAS) frequency of
60 kHz, using a Bruker 1.3 mm HX probe. The spectra were acquired
on a 4.7 T (200 MHz) Bruker AVANCE III widebore magnet at Larmor frequencies
of 77.775 and 81.176 MHz for 7Li and 31P, respectively.
A rotor-synchronized, spin-echo pulse sequence was used for 7Li, with a π/2 pulse length of 1.02 μs at a power of
43.5 W, set on an external reference of Li2CO3 (referenced to 0 ppm). A rotor-synchronized, spin-echo pulse sequence
was also used for 31P with a π/2 pulse length of
1.00 μs at a power of 53 W, set on an external reference of
adenosine diphosphate (referenced to 1 ppm). Recycle delays of 0.1
and 0.01 s were used for 7Li and 31P, respectively.

Computational Methods
Solid-state hybrid density functional
theory (DFT) calculations were performed using CRYSTAL14,45 a linear combination of atomic orbitals code.
On the basis of the procedure developed in previous work,46 the Fermi contact shift was calculated with
two hybrid functionals, B3LYP47 with 20%
Fock exchange and a modified B3LYP with 35% Fock exchange, which will
subsequently be referred to as HYB20 and HYB35, respectively. For
geometry optimizations a small, contracted basis set (BS-I) was used,
which was taken unmodified from the CRYSTAL online repository. BS-I
had the form (7s2p1d)/[1s2sp1d] for Li, (20s12p4d)/[1s4sp2d] for V,
(10s4p1d)/[1s2sp1d] for O, and (16s8p1d)/[1s3sp1d] for P, where the
values in parentheses denote the number of Gaussian primitives and
the values in square brackets denote the contraction scheme. For the
calculation of Fermi contact shifts, a more extended basis set (BS-II)
was used which had the form (9s2p)/[5s2p] for Li, (13s9p5d)/[7s5p3d]
for V, (10s6p2d)/[6s5p2d] for O, and (11s7p3d)/[7s6p3d] for P. BS-II
has previously been used to calculate the Fermi contact shifts of
Fe phosphates46 and Li2VO2.48

Results and Discussion
The reactions occurring during the formation of LVPO upon solid-state
synthesis were investigated by using in situ synchrotron XRD, with
the goal of finding optimum synthesis conditions. The XRD patterns
upon heating the precursor mixture under argon gas are presented in Figure 1a. At low temperature,
only the Li3PO4 crystalline phase is formed.
When the temperature is increased to 500 °C, additional minor
peaks of VO2 are observed, which indicate that some V5+ was reduced, most likely due to the presence of ammonia
during the preheating step. From 500 to 600 °C, only Li3PO4 and VO2 are found. Vanadium and phosphate
start forming chemical bonds to build the (VO)2P2O7 structure when the temperature reaches 650 °C.
With further heating, LVPO becomes the main phase and its characteristic
diffraction peaks become sharper. The peak of VO2 at 2θ
= 11.9° still exists in the XRD pattern at 750 °C. Pure
LVPO is produced at 800 °C, and no further changes are observed
if the heating time is increased from 30 min to 2 h. Rietveld refinement
confirms the phase formed at 800 °C as pure LVPO (space group: P1̅, a = 6.746 Å, b = 7.207 Å, c = 7.928 Å, α = 89.82°,
β = 91.28°, γ = 116.91°, Rwp = 3.5%), as shown in Figure 1b. These lattice parameters are consistent with the
reported data.12 On the basis of these
observations, 800 °C was chosen as the synthesis temperature
of LVPO. The XRD pattern of pristine as-synthesized LVPO is presented
in Figure 2, and it
shows pure LVPO phase with good crystallinity. The Rietveld refinement
results are shown in Figure S1. The SEM
image (Figure 3) reveals
the formation of uniform particles, about 1 μm in size. This
large particle size is due to high synthesis temperature in the absence
of carbon or carbonaceous sources, which could have prevented particle
size growth and form conductive coating, but in case of LVPO, they
cause V4+ to V3+ reduction and therefore cannot
be used.

LVPO and LVPO after HEBM for (b)

To reduce the particle size and provide an electronically
conductive
carbon coating, the as-synthesized LVPO was high-energy ball-milled
with different kinds of carbons and for various periods of time. XRD
patterns of LVPO ball-milled with Super P carbon as a function of
ball-milling time are presented in Figure 2. There is no evidence of the formation of
other phases in the XRD patterns; however, the intensities of the
LVPO characteristic peaks are reduced and the peaks become broader
upon ball-milling. The evolution of the peaks is consistent with decreased
crystallinity and particle size. Another contribution to the peak
broadening could come from increased strain within the particles.
SEM images show that after grinding, the large particles are broken
into smaller particles of average secondary particle size around 500,
300, and 200 nm for the HEBM 0.2 h, HEBM 0.5 h, and HEBM 0.7 h samples,
respectively (Figure 3b–d). To separate contributions from the crystallite size
reduction and strain to the peak broadening, the mean primary crystallite
sizes LVol-IB and the mean strain
values e0 of the pristine and ball-milled
LVPO were calculated by the Double-Voigt approach using TOPAS.43 The results are summarized in Table S1. The crystallite size decreases most significantly
from 250 nm in the pristine material to ∼40 nm after grinding
for 0.5 h and then decreases slightly to about ∼30 nm upon
further ball-milling. Also, it is noted that the strain greatly increases
after ball-milling, which might be caused by the ball-milling-introduced
disorder.

XAS experiments were carried out to study the HEBM
effect on the
local structure of LVPO. As can be seen in Figure 4a, the position of the V K-edge of various
LVPO samples shifts toward lower energy with increasing ball-milling
time. Furthermore, the intensity of the pre-edge peak decreases, and
a shoulder begins to appear on the low-energy side of the pre-edge
with increasing ball-milling time (Figure 4b). Because chemical shifts in the absorption
spectra and variation in the intensity of the pre-peak are directly
related to changes in the average valence state of the absorbing atoms,
the observed changes in the V K-edge absorption spectra indicate slight
reduction of V4+ to V3+ as a result of HEBM.49,50

LVPO samples with the inset showing the onset of Cr K-edge at ∼5989
eV and (b) the near-edge region of the absorption spectra with the
inset showing enlarged pre-edge region; (c) k3-weighted EXAFS signals χ(k); and (d)
their corresponding Fourier transforms at the V K-edge of various
ball-milled LVPO samples.

Figure 4c
illustrates
the k3-weighted χ(k) signals for various ball-milled samples. A closer look at the data
reveals the presence of a spurious feature for all ball-milled samples
at around k ≈ 12 Å–1. This feature, which is localized in energy at ∼5995 eV corresponds
to the Cr K-edge and evidences the Cr-contamination in the ball-milled
material, resulting from the stainless steel jar and balls used during
HEBM. Consequently, the maximum usable k-range for
the Fourier transformation was limited to k ≈
12 Å–1. Nevertheless, modifications in the
χ(k) signals between k = 3
to 7.5 Å–1 clearly indicate changes in the
local atomic arrangements around the central V atoms with increased
ball-milling time (Figure 4d). The observed decrease in the amplitude of the Fourier-transformed
signals indicates increased structural disorder in the ball-milled
materials and is consistent with XRD results. Further analysis of
EXAFS data is presented in the Supporting Information.

To further understand the ball-milling-induced disorder, 7Li solid-state NMR in combination with hybrid DFT calculations
was
used. The V ions in LVPO adopt the V4+ oxidation state
with a d1 electronic configuration (t2g1eg*0) and are thus paramagnetic. The dominant
interactions that affect the NMR spectra of LVPO are therefore between
the electron and nuclear spins that lead to large Fermi contact (paramagnetic)
shifts.51 The structure of LVPO (Figure 5a) contains two crystallographically
distinct Li sites, Li1 and Li2, that are arranged in one-dimensional
(1D) channels along the [110] direction of the cell.16 The 7Li NMR spectrum of pristine LVPO, shown
in Figure 6a, only
contains one main isotropic resonance at 77 ppm, consistent with previous
studies.52 From hybrid DFT calculations,
the 7Li NMR Fermi contact shifts for the Li1 and Li2 sites
are predicted to be 76–91 ppm and 63–75 ppm, respectively.
The upper and lower bounds of the shifts for each site correspond
to the values calculated with the B3LYP (20% Fock exchange) functional
and a modified version of B3LYP functional with 35% Fock exchange,
which will subsequently be referred to as HYB20 and HYB35, respectively.
As both sites have shifts close to 77 ppm, the dominant 7Li NMR peak observed experimentally can be assigned to an overlap
of the Li1 and Li2 environments.53 A series
of very low intensity (<1% overall) peaks are also present in Figure 6a at 0, 19, and 28
ppm. The peak at 0 ppm is associated with a diamagnetic Li environment.
The 19 and 28 ppm peaks are associated with paramagnetic Li environments
and may be due to small amounts of defects within the LVPO phase as
previously reported.54

the position (77 ppm) of the single Li environment in pristine LVPO,
and the black arrow highlights the increase in the intensity at lower
frequencies with HEBM time. All spectra are scaled by the sample mass
and number of scans. There is a larger uncertainty in the intensity
of the 0.4 h of HEBM spectrum as it had a smaller mass. (c) Deconvolution
of the 7Li NMR spectrum of the HEBM 0.5 h sample with two
Lorentzian (peak 1 and peak 2) and 1 Gaussian (peak 3) peaks. (d)
Variation in the integrated intensity of the three Li environments
as a function of HEBM time.

Upon ball-milling, there is a decrease in intensity of the
resonance
at 77 ppm and an increase in the intensity of new resonances at lower
frequency as shown in Figure 6b. The full 7Li NMR spectra, including spinning
sidebands at different ball-milling times, were deconvoluted to rationalize
the changes in the local Li environments. As shown for the HEBM 0.5
h sample in Figure 6c, the spectrum could be adequately fit with three peaks: two Lorentzian-type
peaks at approximately 79 ppm (peak 1) and approximately 3 ppm (peak
2) and a broad Gaussian-type peak at approximately 40 ppm (peak 3).
A multistep fitting procedure was used for each spectrum (full details
in the Supporting Information) in which
the peak intensities, positions, and widths were all allowed to vary
in the final step. The variation in the peak intensities of the three
peaks is shown in Figure 6d and the variations in the peak widths and positions are
shown in Figure S4. It can be seen from Figure 6d that after 0.2
h of HEBM, there is a decrease in the fraction of pristine LVPO environments
(peak 1) at the expense of the broad component at approximately 40
ppm (peak 3). Only a small fraction (1.3%) of the environment at ∼3
ppm (peak 2) is present after 0.2 h of HEBM. As the HEBM time increases,
the fractions of the 3 and 40 ppm environments increase systematically,
whereas the fraction of the pristine LVPO Li environment decreases.
The broad nature of the peak at 40 ppm suggests that upon HEBM, a
distribution of Li sites is formed. As the XRD patterns in Figure 2 did not show significant
changes to the long-range structure of the material, the changes in
the Li environment must be related to changes in the local structure,
potentially due to a disordering of the Li1 and Li2 ions in the 1D
tunnels along the [110] direction of the structure. To investigate
the variation in the Li shift with different Li positions, a model
structure of disordered LVPO, subsequently referred to as structure-B,
was generated in which the Li positions in both tunnels were initially
made equivalent, with two distinct Li sites per tunnel, as shown in Figure 5b. (Full details
of the generation of the structure can be found in the Supporting Information). After full structural
optimization, the energy of structure-B was found to be 0.014 eV/atom
higher than that of the ground-state structure of LVPO. As thermal
energy is approximately 0.026 eV/atom at 297 K, it is expected that
the Li configurations of this nature should be accessible during ball-milling.
Although these calculations are focused on bulk LVPO structures, the
relative stability of different Li orderings in experiment will also
be affected by the strain induced by nanosizing. The hyperfine shifts
of the Li sites in the structure-B are shown in Table S2. The two Li sites in structure-B (Lia and Lib) have
shifts of 18–22 ppm and 37–55 ppm, which are close to
the range of the experimentally observed shifts of 3 and 40 ppm. In
both the ground-state structure of LVPO and structure-B, the oxidation
state of V is nominally V4+. The variation in the 7Li Fermi contact shifts for the different Li sites in the
two structures is therefore related to local differences in the bond
lengths and bond angles of the Li–O–V4+ bond
pathways over which the unpaired spin density on the V4+ site is transferred to the Li nucleus.

In similar families
of phosphate materials, such as NaV2(PO4)2F3,55 it has been observed
that charge disproportionation from V4+ to regions of V3+ (t2g2eg*0) and diamagnetic
V5+ (t2g0eg*0) can occur, which could result in a variation
in the magnitude of the Fermi contact shift experienced by 7Li. However, in the current LVPO system, significant charge disproportionation
is unlikely to be the cause of the additional peaks, as the formation
of V3+ rich domains would be expected to result in an increase
in the 7Li NMR shift due to the greater number of unpaired
electrons on V3+, as has been previously observed in LiVPO4F.53

Structure-B adopts one
of many possible metastable Li orderings
of LVPO; however, the good agreement between the experimentally and
computationally observed Li shifts suggests that similar local environments
may be formed, particularly during the early stages of HEBM, coexisting
with aforementioned V3+ and Cr impurities. After extended
HEBM, the significant strains imposed on the structure may lead to
new, highly disordered Li environments that are not included in the
current DFT structural models.

The 31P NMR spectrum
of as-synthesized LVPO (Figure 7a) contains two isotropic
resonances at 1589 and 1426 ppm, which is consistent with the two
crystallographically distinct P sites expected in the structure. The
experimentally observed shifts at 1589 and 1426 ppm can be assigned
to the P1 and P2 sites in the LVPO structure, respectively, from hybrid
DFT calculations, which predict Fermi contact shifts of 1474–1885
ppm (P1) and 975–1381 ppm (P2). Upon HEBM, the P1 and P2 peaks
in pristine LVPO broaden significantly and decrease in intensity,
as shown in Figure 7b. It can also be seen from Figure 7b that HEBM introduces a very broad 31P
environment at higher frequency. The different local P environments
can be seen more clearly from a deconvolution of the 31P NMR spectrum of the HEBM 0.5 h sample in Figure 7c. From Figure 7c, it is evident that after 0.5 h of HEBM,
the P1 (peak 1) and P2 (peak 2) environments are still present at
1600 and 1519 ppm, respectively; however, the spectrum is dominated
by the broad component centered at approximately 1890 ppm. It was
not possible to exactly quantify the fraction of the different P environments
in Figure 7c, primarily
due to the very short T2 relaxation of the broad component that resulted
in the majority of the signal being lost during the echo pulse sequence.
However, as can be seen from Figure 7b, the fraction of the broad component increases relative
to the pristine P environments as the HEBM time is increased. From
the hybrid DFT calculations in Table S2, it can be seen that two distinct P sites are present in structure-B.
The first P environment at 1608 ppm has a shift intermediate between
the P1 and P2 sites of pristine LVPO, whereas the second environment
at 2194 ppm has a shift close to that of the broad 31P
environment at 1890 ppm. The similarity between the computed and experimentally
observed 31P NMR shifts further suggests that the Li positions
have become disordered from their initial positions (Li1 and Li2)
in the pristine LVPO structure, which subsequently results in significant
distortions of the local 31P environments.

We studied the electrochemical behavior of the LVPO ball-milled
for various lengths of time to correlate the observed structural disorder
with the electrochemical performance. The discharge–charge
curves in the first cycle at C/50 (0.0076 mA cm–2) are shown in Figure 8a; the samples were discharged to 1.6 V first (lithium insertion).
The voltage profiles of the ball-milled materials show all features
expected for pure LVPO, that is, the 4 V plateau for V5+/V4+ and the three plateaus below 3 V because of the existence
of the intermediate phases, Li1.5VOPO4, and
Li1.75VOPO413,16,56 before complete reduction to Li2VOPO4. The capacities at C/50 rate are approaching the theoretical
limit of 305 mA h g–1 for the sample ball-milled
for 0.5 h, which appears to be the optimum ball-milling time. The
discharge capacities of LVPO with various ball-milling time in the
high-voltage (4.2–2.5 V) and low-voltage (2.5–1.6 V)
regimes are separately shown in Table S6. Upon increase of the ball-milling time from 0.2 to 0.5 h, the high-voltage
capacity increases from 123 to 152 mA h g–1, approaching
the theoretical capacity for one Li ion intercalation (153 mA h g–1). However, the low-voltage capacity achieves its
maximum of ∼150 mA h g–1 already after 0.3
h HEBM and does not change with increase of ball-milling time to 0.5
h. Ball-milling for over 0.5 h leads to the capacity decrease in both
high- and low-voltage regimes. It is interesting to note that the
voltage profiles are also affected by the ball-milling time. Increasing
the ball-milling time up to 0.5 h results in longer high-voltage plateaus
and a more sloping transition between the high- and low-voltage plateaus,
which leads to an overall increase in the capacity. For the 0.6 and
0.7 h samples, the high-voltage plateau becomes washed out resulting
in the capacity decrease.

at a rate of C/50;
the first discharge curves only (inset), (b) the rate capability,
and (c) discharge capacities upon the extended cycling at C/20 of
LVPO after ball-milling with Super P carbon for 0.2–0.7 h.

The impact of increasing the current
density from C/10 (0.038 mA
cm–2) to 2 C (0.76 mA cm–2) on
the capacity is shown in Figure 8b. As expected, the capacity decreases with increasing
rate of reaction but the original capacity is restored when the rate
is reduced back to C/10. This indicates that the loss of capacity
is a kinetic effect and that the active material is not being degraded
during the cycling. Here, again 0.5 h of ball-milling appears to be
optimal. The extended cycling of the materials at C/20 (0.019 mA cm–2) shown in Figure 8c also reveals that the HEBM 0.5 h material retains
its capacity the best. This material retains 94% of the original discharge
capacity after 50 cycles, compared with 62, 82, and 82% for the HEBM
0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 h samples, respectively.

The existence of
an optimum ball-milling time appears to be the
result of the beneficial shortening of the Li diffusion pathways upon
particle size decrease competing with generation of detrimental defects
and strain upon prolonged ball-milling.22 As it was mentioned earlier, the most significant particle size
reduction occurs during the initial 0.5 h of ball-milling. At the
same time, the integrated intensity of the broad 7Li NMR
peak corresponding to the disordered Li sites increases. Further ball-milling
does not lead to the increase of the broad 7Li NMR peak
intensity; however, the intensity of 3 ppm NMR peak keeps increasing
at the expense of the 77 ppm resonance ascribed to the two Li sites
in the ordered LVPO structure. The experimentally observed decline
in the electrochemical performance upon 0.6–0.7 h ball-milling
suggests that these changes are detrimental for Li-ion diffusion.
This might happen because over ball-milling reduces crystallinity,
which could lead to fewer sites available for Li storage.22,57

HEBM affects the electrochemical performance differently for
high-
and low-voltage regimes. The capacity in the high-voltage regime keeps
increasing to the theoretical capacity with extending ball-milling
time from 0.2 to 0.5 h, whereas the capacity in low-voltage regime
reaches the theoretical capacity after 0.3 h of ball-milling and does
not change with extending ball-milling time to 0.5 h. These results
reveal that nanosizing by ball-milling is more critical to increase
the Li ion diffusivity in the high-voltage regime, which indicates
poorer Li diffusion kinetics in high-voltage relative to low-voltage
regime, consistent with our previous reports.16

Washing out of the high-voltage plateau upon ball-milling
is also
consistent with the structural disorder observed by NMR and XAS techniques.
The existence of high-voltage plateau indicates a two-phase reaction
between LiVOPO4 and VOPO4, upon which the ratio
between LiVOPO4 and VOPO4 phases changes upon
Li cycling, whereas the Li sites remain unaffected. The sloping voltage
profile observed in ball-milled LVPO, points toward increased solid–solution
type of reaction as a result of Li site disorder and strain introduced
by ball-milling, which might make the coexistence of two phases unstable
in smaller particles, resulting in a solid–solution behavior
similar to one reported in LiFePO4.22,24,58 In this case, the voltage changes continuously
as Li ions are removed from various disordered sites.

To improve
the electronic conductivity of the LVPO + carbon composite,
we tested the electrochemical performance and complex impedance of
LVPO with different kinds of carbons. We used carbons of various morphology
and conductivity: acetylene black (AB), graphene nanoplatelets (GN),
and Graphite (GP), in addition to Super P carbon (SP), with the optimized
ball-milling time of 0.5 h. Because the use of carbonaceous precursors
in the solid-state synthesis of LVPO was ruled out because vanadium
is easily reduced by carbon, it is important to optimize the carbon
coating step and provide a uniform conducting coating. The electrochemical
test results (Figure 9) show that the LVPO composite with GN exhibits the best initial
capacity and rate capability and the LVPO composites with GP and AB
have similar capacities and rate capabilities, whereas that with SP
performs the worst in both tests. The average discharge capacities
are 235, 222, 217, and 196 mA h g–1 for LVPO + GN,
LVPO + GP, LVPO + AB, and LVPO + SP, respectively, at a rate of C/10
(0.038 mA cm–2). When the rate is raised to 2 C
(0.76 mA cm–2), the capacities are reduced to 205,
181, 177, and 141 mA h g–1, corresponding to 87,
82, 82, and 72% of the C/10 capacity, respectively. This enhanced
capacity is retained over extended cycling at a C/5 rate (0.076 mA
cm–2), with essentially no capacity fade for the
LVPO + AB composite, whereas that of LVPO + GN fades noticeably upon
cycling (Figure 9b).
The cyclic voltammograms of these four LVPO + carbon composites were
measured at a 0.02 mV s–1 scan rate to elucidate
any fine differences between the three samples. The CV results reveal
that use of these four carbon additives leads to variations in the
reversibility of reaction as measured from the difference between
the anodic and cathodic peaks ΔEp = Epa – Epc (Figure 9c). A small value of ΔEp indicates
a good reversibility of electrochemical reaction.59 Out of the four composites, the LVPO + AB composite has
the smallest values of ΔEp at high
voltage and comparatively small values for the three low-voltage peaks
(Table 1), consistent
with the cycling performance.

C/5, and (c) cyclic
voltammograms of LVPO ball-milled for 0.5 h with different conductive

LVPO + GP	61	54	160	290	
LVPO + SP	111	90	206	329	
To understand the advantages of using
AB as the carbon additive,
first, the electronic conductivity (σe) of the pressed
pellets of SP, AB, GN, and GP was measured. The σe of AB, GP, and GN was found to be higher than that of SP carbon,
measuring 1.0, 6.3, 155, and 0.44 S cm–1, respectively.
The morphologies of the four carbons are shown in Figure S5a–d. Both the SP and AB have very homogenous
particles with size of ∼50 nm. GN has the flakelike particles
with size of ∼100 nm. The particle size of platelike graphite
is not homogeneous; some particles are ∼10 μm, much bigger
than the pristine LVPO (Figure 3a). After ball-milling, SP and AB particles disperse well
on the surface of LVPO, giving intimate contact between LVPO and carbon
(Figures 3c and S5e). The flakelike GN particles cover the surface
of LVPO (Figure S5f). For the LVPO + GP
sample, a lot of big GP particles can still be observed after ball-milling
(Figure S5g). Poor contact between LVPO
and such large GP particles might impede an effective conducting network
forming among LVPO.

The complex impedance spectra of these four
LVPO composites were
studied to examine the effect of different carbons on charge transfer
through the electrodes. The impedance spectra are shown in Figure 10 together with
a simplified equivalent circuit model. In this model, the high-frequency
intercept at the ZRe axis corresponds
to the Ohmic resistance (RΩ), which
represents the resistance of the electrolyte; Rf is related to the Li-ion migration resistance through the
solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film;60 and Rct, a depressed semicircle, is
associated with charge-transfer resistance. A constant phase element
is usually used to simulate the capacitance contributed by the active
material. The sloping line at low frequency is Warburg impedance (Zw). The parameters of the equivalent circuits
for LVPO with different carbon additives are shown in Table 2. The simulation results show
that the RΩ values of these four
samples are very similar. However, LVPO + GN exhibits a greatly reduced Rf (6.2 Ω), comparing to the other three
samples, suggesting a suppressed SEI formation on the surface of LVPO
due to the coverage with the GN particles. However, the Rct value of LVPO + AB (98 Ω) is considerably lower
than those of LVPO + GN (114 Ω), LVPO + GP (118 Ω), or
LVPO + SP (145 Ω). A low charge-transfer resistance indicates
that there is a good conducting network on the surface of the LVPO,
which enhances the electronic conductivity of the composite and promotes
the electrochemical reaction. This data indicates that an intimate
contact between GN and LVPO might not be easily formed by ball-milling
only, despite the fact that the GN can cover the surface of LVPO.
These results support the preferred use of acetylene black as the
carbon additive to LVPO in ball-milled composites because of its relatively
high electronic conductivity and a good conducting network. This composite
was further used in the study of the ionically conductive coating.

To
improve the ionic transport on the particle surface and to protect
it from possible side reactions with the electrolyte, Li3VO4 (LVO) was tested as an ionically conductive coating.
It was chosen because it does not introduce any additional chemical
elements and because of the known positive effect of LVO coating on
oxide cathodes.37−42 LVO was synthesized by a hydrothermal reaction,33 and its XRD pattern (Figure 11a) shows a pure and highly crystalline phase.
The lattice parameters (space group: Pnm21, a = 6.328 Å, b = 5.453 Å, c = 4.961 Å, α = β = γ = 90°, Rwp = 7.6%) are consistent with the earlier report.61 The intrinsic ionic conductivity of LVO measured
at room temperature is 3.6 × 10–7 S cm–1 (Figure S6), consistent
with the reported values.62,63 The measured electronic
conductivity of LVO is 1.3 × 10–8 S cm–1 (Figure S6), higher than
the reported electronic conductivity of LVPO with 5.5 × 10–11 S cm–1,64 suggesting that the highly ionically conductive LVO can also benefit
the surface electronic conductivity of LVPO.

LVO; (b) XRD patterns of LVPO/LVO
sintered at different temperatures; (c) TEM patterns of LVPO/LVO and
SAED at near-surface region of LVPO/LVO (inset); (d) XPS spectra of
O 1s and V 2p for pristine LVPO, as-synthesized LVO, and four different
spots of the coated sample LVPO/LVO.

The optimum formation temperature of the LVPO/LVO composite
was
studied by XRD over the temperature range 300–700 °C.
The results are shown in Figure 11b and indicate that impurity phases are formed above
300 °C. Thus, the composite, LVPO/LVO = 10:1 weight ratio, was
only heated to 300 °C. The diffraction patterns do not reveal
any crystalline LVO phase. However, TEM study shows that there is
an amorphous coating, ∼15 nm, on the surface of the LVPO particles
(Figure 11c). The
SAED pattern at near-surface region shows the [101̅] of LVPO,
indicating its crystallinity as shown in the inset of Figure 11c. The d-spacings
of (010) planes and (101) planes are 6.4 and 4.7 Å, respectively,
which are consistent with the lattice parameters of triclinic LVPO.

Surface-sensitive XPS was used to confirm the presence of LVO coating
on the LVPO particles. XPS spectra of the pristine LVPO, hydrothermally
synthesized LVO, and LVO-coated LVPO samples are shown in Figure 11d. Each spectrum
includes three main peaks, O 1s peak, and the spin orbit split V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 peaks. The binding energies for
V5+ (518.20 eV) and V4+ (517.0 eV) are marked
relative to the O 1s (531.2 eV) as described by Silversmit et al.65 The vanadium oxidation states of pure LVO and
LVPO are found to be V5+ and V4+, respectively,
in agreement with previous studies.66−70 The XPS spectra of coated LVPO display vanadium oxidation
states of both V5+ and V4+, corresponding to
the surface coating of LVO and the bulk of LVPO, which confirms the
presence of a thin LVO coating on the surface of LVPO particles observed
by TEM. Furthermore, XPS spectra acquired on multiple spots of LVO-coated
LVPO show no variation, which confirms uniform coverage of LVO coating
on the surface of LVPO particles.

Comparison of the complex
impedance plots of the LVPO/LVO + AB
composite with the uncoated LVPO + AB composite shows that the former
has reduced surface resistance as indicated in Figure 12a. The values of each resistance component
of LVPO/LVO and uncoated LVPO are listed in Table 2. RΩ of
LVPO/LVO is similar to that of uncoated LVPO; However, Rf and Rct of LVPO/LVO are
much smaller, 3.4 versus 19 Ω and 36 versus 98 Ω, respectively.
A greatly reduced Rf suggests that the
LVO coating layer suppresses the side reactions between the electrolyte
and LVPO, therefore limiting the formation of a resistive SEI film.
The Rct decrease can be attributed to
the enhanced Li ion and electron transportation through the surface
of LVPO particles coated with LVO. All together, the low SEI and charge-transfer
resistance can positively affect the electrochemical performance of
LVPO/LVO.

capability and capacity retention (inset); and (f) discharge capacities
upon extended cycling at C/5 (0.076 mA cm–2) of
uncoated LVPO and LVPO/LVO plotted per g of LVPO.

The cyclic voltammograms of LVPO/LVO and the uncoated LVPO
scanned
at different rates are presented in Figure 12b. Both exhibit all expected cathodic/anodic
potential peaks in high- and low-voltage regimes. In addition, the
CV result of LVPO/LVO does not show extra redox peaks due to LVO,
a widely studied anode material, or any other phase. This result is
consistent with the charge–discharge curves of LVO in the voltage
window of 1.6–4.5 V (Figure S7),
confirming that LVO is electrochemically inactive above ∼1
V.36,71−74 Compared to the uncoated sample,
LVPO/LVO displays more distinct potential peaks and smaller peak separations
with increasing scan rate from 0.02 to 1.00 mV s–1, suggesting the improved kinetics of Li diffusion and electron transfer.75,76 The Li chemical diffusion coefficient can be determined using the
Randles–Sevcik equation  where ip is the
peak current (at Epc4, A); n is the number of electrons for per redox reaction; A is the surface of the electrode (cm2); D is the Li chemical diffusion coefficient (cm2 s–1); v is the scan rate (V s–1);
and CLi is the lithium concentration in
the electrochemical reaction (mol cm–3). Figure 12c shows the linear
regression plot on ip – v1/2. The calculated Li chemical diffusion coefficient
for LVPO/LVO is 2 × 10–12 cm2 s–1, which is an order of magnitude higher than that
of uncoated LVPO with 2 × 10–13 cm2 s–1. The CV results reveal that LVO coating on
the surface of LVPO improves the kinetics of electrochemical reaction,
most likely by means of decrease in the charge-transfer resistance
as suggested by the EIS results discussed above.

The first full
cycles at a C/5 (0.076 mA cm–2) intercalation rate
of LVPO/LVO and uncoated LVPO are compared in Figure 12d. The 10 wt %
LVO-coated material shows higher discharge capacity than uncoated
LVPO, 250 mA h g–1 versus 210 mA h g–1 in the first discharge at C/5. The additional capacity comes from
the sloping parts of the discharge curve, leaving the plateaus unaffected.
The rate capability of these two composites (Figure 12e) demonstrates that the LVO-coated composite
retains capacity better at higher rates, which can be attributed to
the improved charge transfer on the surface. The LVO-coated composite
maintains its enhanced capacity upon extensive cycling as presented
in Figure 12f. These
capacities are calculated per g of LVPO because LVO is electrochemically
inactive. The capacities calculated per g of LVPO + LVO presented
in Figure S8 also show higher values for
the LVO-coated composite.

These results show that nanosizing
and coating the electrochemically
active LVPO phase increase Li diffusivity and reduce SEI and charge-transfer
resistance of the cathode composite. Both rate and cycling performance
of the LVPO/LVO/AB composite indicate that the modified ε-LiVOPO4 has inherently good ionic conductivity and reversibility.
Similar to LiFePO4, it requires nanosizing and conductive
coating to achieve full theoretical capacity. However, LiVOPO4 presents more challenges related to its reactivity with common
electrolytes77 and structural diversity.
Here, we have demonstrated the benefits of surface coating to address
the issue of side reactions and to reduce charge-transfer resistance.
However, the outstanding challenge is related to the structural stability
of this phase. LiVOPO4 has two structurally alike polymorphs,
ε- and β-, which are close in energy. Moreover, there
are sites for the second Li intercalation in this structure. These
are the most likely reasons why HEBM induces structural disorder,
which leads to washing out of the 4 V plateau. To completely utilize
the high-voltage capacity of ε-LiVOPO4, a nanosized
and well-crystalline material is required.

Conclusions
ε-LiVOPO4 undergoes structural disorder upon high-energy
ball-milling, which leads to modification of the Li-diffusion pathways
in the ball-milled material. As a result, the high-voltage plateau
becomes washed out and the overall voltage profile becomes sloping,
rather than step-like. There appears to be an optimum ball-milling
time, about 0.5 h in our settings, when the positive effect of particle
size decrease is not overwhelmed by detrimental structural defects.
The type of carbon used for carbon coating during the high-energy
ball-milling and the use of an additional ionically conductive Li3VO4 coating have a noticeable effect on the electrochemical
performance of ε-LiVOPO4. The optimized composite
of ε-LiVOPO4 coated with Li3VO4 and acetylene black shows reduced SEI and charge-transfer resistances,
resulting in the electrochemical capacities close to the theoretical
value of 305 mA h g–1 at C/50 and retaining 250
mA h g–1 at C/5 (0.076 mA cm–2) for at least 70 cycles. However, to completely utilize the theoretical
capacity in the high-voltage plateau, methods to produce nanosized
and crystalline ε-LiVOPO4 are required.
