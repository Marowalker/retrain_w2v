An empty fruit bunch (EFB) is a byproduct
of the palm oil production
process with an undried moisture content of 60–70%, which is
too high for use as direct combustion fuel. Drying processes are generally
considered essential for the recent use of EFBs as power plant fuels
because their high moisture content decreases the boiler efficiency.
The lower moisture content of dried EFBs increases the heating value
and boiler efficiency but creates a trade-off with the energy required
for the drying process. This study developed an EFB-based 10 MW power
plant model by integrating economic evaluations in order to obtain
optimal drying conditions. A hot air dryer was used in the drying
process. The EFB evaporation behavior was predicted by reflecting
the drying kinetics of EFBs in Aspen Plus. The optimum drying conditions
were found to be a steam recirculation ratio of 0.25 and drying time
of 23 min, creating dried EFBs with a 9.91% moisture content, which
reduced costs by 5.48% relative to the undried base scenario. In addition,
the developed model was compared to the drying process of a real power
plant currently under construction in Indonesia. This drying process
reduces the EFB moisture content from 48 to 20%.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The use of biomass as power plant fuel is globally well accepted
due to fossil fuel depletion and global warming. Indonesia, for instance,
has plans to reduce the proportion of fossil fuel power plants and
increase that of biomass power plants by 2025.1 Various types of biomass will be used as a fuel for power plants,
including wood, grain, and municipal solid wastes; however, the most
suitable appears to be empty fruit bunches (EFBs), a type of biomass
occurring in palm oil production in Indonesia. Because Indonesia is
the largest producer of palm oil, it produces a 30 million EFBs,2 making the EFB fuel costs lower than other biomasses
and allowing easy continuous fuel supply and security. However, not
all EFBs are suitable as power plant fuels until properly dried, as
their typical moisture content (MC) ranges from 60 to 70%.3 Such high MCs cause numerous problems, including
lower combustion temperatures and burning stability, higher CO and
volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, and difficult boiler operations.4,5 In addition, the boiler efficiency is reduced by increasing heat
losses including flue gas, chemical unburned carbon, and mechanical
unburned carbon losses.6

The multiple
disadvantages of using raw EFB biomass as power plant
fuel can be solved by removing moisture from the biomass. Drying methods
are broadly divided into two categories: mechanical drying, which
can reduce moisture by up to 50 wt % through shredding, grinding,
pressing, and filtering; and thermal drying with direct or indirect
dryer use, which reduces MCs to less than 50 wt %.2 Thermal drying has large energy and cost requirements because
of the high specific heat of moisture. Assuming a reference temperature
is 15 °C, the evaporation energy of water per kilogram ranges
from 2.48 to 2.57 MJ.7 Therefore, many
studies have been conducted to improve the utilization of solid fuel
while minimizing the drying energy.

Primary researches on this
subject are most of the experimental
studies focusing on the drying kinetic mechanism of biomass and the
characteristic of dried products.8−10 The mathematical modeling
studies on biomass drying make it possible to predict drying behavior,
diffusivity, the temperature profile of biomass, and VOCs occurred
drying.11−17 Several previous studies have reported that the integration of biomass
drying and power plants has improved the thermal efficiency of boilers.18−21

Luk et al.18 compared the energy
efficiency
when each of hot air dryer (HAD) and superheated steam dryer (SSD)
integrates with the biomass power plant. The way of single drying,
both HAD and SSD enhanced energy efficiency for condition that was
not through drying process, 21.56 to 25.99 and 23.18%, respectively.
The overall energy efficiency combined with HAD and SSD was 26.90%.
Li et al.19 studied capital costs and operating
costs in detail using two types of heat sources as flue gas or superheated
steam. The use of flue gas as a drying medium resulted in lower capital
costs. However, there was a possibility of pollutant emission. The
superheated steam has relatively high capital costs, although it has
short drying time, environmental protection, and good heat recovery.
Literature provided by the Northwest Combined Heat and Power Application
Center20 suggests that the optimum biomass
MC for direct combustion is 10–15%. The boiler efficiency in
this range was 80%, which was higher than the 74% when the MC was
45%. Gebreegziabher et al.21 have developed
a mathematical model of drying to optimize the annual profit of process
varying with woodchip size. The annual profit for wood chip sizes
of 0.0005, 0.005, and 0.05 m were investigated, respectively. Of these,
the profit was the highest at 0.0005 m.

The above-cited studies
presented a useful perspective of integration
of the drying process with power plant and thermal efficiency related
to the MC during drying. However, they lack proper discussion on the
specific topic regarding how optimum drying condition and MC are obtained.
Although Gebreegziabher et al.21 developed
the drying model to study the trade-off between the heating value
and MC, they focused on operating conditions dependent on drying temperature
and particle size while limiting the biomass MC to 17% (minimum calorific
value 15 MJ/kg). In addition, the drying kinetics needed to implement
these models apply the commonly used Fick’s model of diffusion,
not optimized for EFB. In another paper by Gebreegziabher et al.22 a study was conducted to minimize the cost by
heat integrating the drying process developed in the previous paper21 with a biomass power plant. However, it does
not reflect changes in boiler efficiency according to MCs of fuel.
Therefore, the objective of this work developed an optimization model
to investigate the optimum drying conditions and MC applying the drying
kinetics obtained from the EFB drying experimental data and the variation
of boiler efficiency with moisture. As shown in Figure 1, this model with integrated drying process
and power plant is utilized to examine this trade-off varying with
parameter such as drying time or steam recirculation ratio. Appling
drying kinetics due to EFB material properties, which is previously
reported, to the model allowed prediction of EFB evaporation behavior,
temperature, and relative humidity (RH) of air, and a more detailed
economic analysis was conducted.

2 Process Modeling
2.1 Process Overview
A 10 MW small-scale
biomass power plant under construction in Indonesia was simulated
in Aspen Plus. As shown Figure 1, the overall process contains a shredding process, drying
process, boiler, and steam cycle. A lower volume of dried EFB than
raw EFB is required to generate 10 MW because dried EFB increases
the heating value and boiler efficiency. The simulation was designed
to vary the amount of EFB used with a target of 10 MW power generation.
A description of the process is given below.1. 60% MC EFB is finely
crushed by a shredder
to 5 mm pieces, reducing the MC to 48%. The 48% MC EFB enters a hot
air rotary dryer.

2. Air
entering the rotary dryer raises
the temperature via heat exchange with a portion of the steam exiting
the turbine. The heated air comes into direct contact with EFBs inside
the dryer, evaporating moisture from the material and exchanging heat
to reduce the EFB MC to 20%. Ideally, air and EFBs are well mixed.
The steam (191 °C, 12 atm) used for drying is fully condensed
(188 °C, 12 atm) after heating the air, and the condensed water
enters a tank to preheat the feed water (FW).

3. Dried EFBs are burned in the boiler,
and the flue gas is discharged at 200 °C. The heat generated
by burning EFBs creates 433 °C, 60 atm steam.

4. The high-temperature, high-pressure
steam is discharged at 0.107 atm after turning the turbine and producing
10 MW electricity. A portion of the steam exiting the turbine extraction
valve is used for drying. The low-pressure steam (0.107 atm) discharged
from turbine is fully condensed by the condenser and recirculated
in the steam cycle.



2.2 Drying
Process
2.2.1 Dryer Model
Dryers are classified
as co-current or counter-current depending on the directions in which
the solid and air flow.23 Counter-current
dryers can produce solids with lower MC; however, the driest solids
contact the hottest air, creating a potential fire risk when the dryer
operates at high temperatures if the solids are flammable.23,24 As biomass generally has a fire risk, this study selected co-current
dryers (using a direct rotary dryer and air heater) for investigation.
In co-current dryers, the solid and hot air are in direct contact
with each other, and the transfer phenomenon moves moisture from the
solid to the air. This evaporation process requires a large amount
of energy because moisture has a high specific heat. The dryer was
assumed to be in a steady state with no heat loss. The dryer unit
was modeled in Aspen Plus by eqs 1–8.25Equations 1–4 represent the material and energy balance of the
dryer, whereas eqs 5–8 produce results required to calculate the balance
equation. The moisture mass balances of the solid and air are given
as eqs 1 and 2, respectively. The energy balance equations of the
solid and air are given as eqs (3) and (4), respectively. The balance
equation can be solved by determining Ṁ˙ and Q̇˙, which are the heat flow rate and evaporation rate of one particle,
respectively. If Ṁ˙ is determined, when the dryer is discretized into the balance cell
using the finite difference time (Δτ) over the total residence
time in the dryer (t), it is possible to calculate
the solid outlet MC (Xi+1) from the solid inlet MC (Xi), which is entering the cell. Similarly, the MC of the gas
leaving the cell (Yi+1) can be computed from the inlet MC of the gas (Yi). If Q̇˙ is obtained, it predicts changes in solid outlet
temperature (TS,i+1)
and gas outlet temperature (TG,i+1) over time. An EFB particle size of 5 mm was used in median
particle diameter (dp) to obtain a total
number of particles (Np) and surface area
of one particle (Ap). 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8  where Ṁs and ṀG are the mass
flow rate
solid and gas in the dryer, respectively; TS,i is the inlet temperature of solids; TG,i is the inlet temperature of gas; hv is the enthalpy of evaporation; Cp,s is the specific heat capacity
of the dry solids; Cp,M is the specific heat capacity of the moisture; Cp,G is the specific heat capacity of
the dry gas; X is the dry-based MC of the solids;
ν˙ is the normalized drying rate of single
particles; ρ is the solid density; ρG is the
gas density; βG is the coefficient for mass transfer
between the surface of the particle and the gas; Y* is the MC of the gas at adiabatic saturation; Y is the MC that gas actually has at the considered position in the
dryer; αG is the heat-transfer coefficient gas and
particles; and xi is
the mass fraction of the particles within the class i.

2.2.2 Drying Kinetics
The falling rate
drying curves, critical MC (Xc), equilibrium
MC, and heat- and mass-transfer coefficients of the EFB were required
to develop a drying kinetics model in Aspen Plus. Q̇˙ and Ṁ˙ were obtained from the drying kinetics model.

The drying curve
includes several stages. First, the solid is heated by a heat source
such as hot air. Next, moisture on the surface of the solid evaporates
during the constant rate drying period. This drying rate remains the
same regardless of the material under constant drying conditions because
the moisture on the surface of the material evaporates. When surface
moisture has been removed, moisture inside the solid evaporates during
the falling rate drying period. The point when the rate changes from
the constant rate drying period to the falling rate drying period
is called the critical MC. As drying continues, moisture in the dry
air reaches an equilibrium with moisture in the solid, after which
no more moisture evaporates. This point is called the equilibrium
MC. Because the particle structure inside the material affects the
drying rate during the falling rate drying period, different materials
have different drying curves in the falling rate drying period. To
more accurately predict the evaporative behavior of EFBs, an EFB falling
rate drying curve was modeled in Aspen Plus.26 9  where  denotes the
normalized MC. The critical
MC depends not only on the material and shape but also on the velocity
and temperature of the drying air. Because many factors affect the
critical MC, the mean values of critical MC shown in Table 1 were used.26 The equilibrium MC is influenced by RH and temperature
of surrounding air and usually approaches zero at high temperatures
and low RH.

Heat- and mass-transfer coefficients are calculated
using eqs 10–17.25,27,28 The diffusion
coefficient vapor in the gas (δG), dynamic viscosity
of the gas (ηG), thermal conductivity of the gas
(λG), and the gas density used to calculate the Lewis
(Le), Schmidt (Sc), Reynolds (Re), and Sherwood (Sh) number were obtained
through Aspen Plus stream analysis. The diameter in the original mass-transfer
coefficient and Reynolds number equation was replaced with sauter
mean diameter (d32) and median particle
diameter for EFBs, respectively. As shown in eqs 10–17, the heat,
mass-transfer coefficient, and evaporation are improved by higher
drying temperatures, higher velocities, and smaller particle sizes.
The air velocity in the dryer (uG) was
typically 0.5–2.5 m/s,29 and the
mean value was used to calculate the Reynolds number. 10   11   12   13   14   15   16   17  

2.2.3 Air Heater
As shown in Figure 1, the air exchanges
heat with the portion of steam exiting the turbine, with the heat
of condensation in the steam heating the air. Air and steam flow counter-currently
to remove the maximum amount of heat from the steam. Steam (191 °C,
12 atm) is completely condensed and becomes water (188 °C, 12
atm). The temperature of the hot air leaving the heat exchanger (HEX)
cannot exceed 191 °C, the temperature at which the steam enters.

The temperature of the air exiting the heat exchanger depends on
the air flow rate and can range between 30 and 191 °C. EFB MC
changes over time were simulated, reflecting the drying kinetics. Figure 2 shows the simulation
results and indicates that hotter air required less time to produce
a lower-moisture-content EFB. Therefore, the most efficient drying
air temperature is highest in the possible temperature range.

Figure 2 EFB drying
curves at various air temperatures.

Although the temperature range peaked at 191 °C, the highest
possible air temperature was set at 181 °C with consideration
of typical minimum temperature difference. The dry air flow rate was
designed to vary with the steam recirculation ratio such that increasing
the steam recirculation ratio would increase the dry air flow rate
to match 181 °C.

2.3 Combustion Process
2.3.1 Combustion Model
The EFB heating
value, which varies with the MC, is important when calculating the
amount of EFB required to generate 10 MW power. As it was impossible
to obtain heating values for all MCs in this experiment, heating values
were estimated for different MCs using the Aspen Plus combustion model.
The combustion process was modeled using the Rgibbs reactor. In an
Rgibbs reactor, combustion reactions are conducted to minimize the
Gibbs free energy. The experimental results of proximate and ultimate
EFB analysis shown in Table 2, calculated using EFBs imported from Indonesia, are required
to model biomass combustion reactions. If an EFB heating value corresponding
to an arbitrary MC was specified in the model, the EFB heating value
at a different MC could be obtained by burning EFB in the model. The
experimental in Table 2 was used to specify the heat of combustion (heating value) at an
arbitrary MC (20%). The model-estimated higher heating value (HHV)
of EFB is plotted as black lines in Figure 3, and the experimentally obtained HHV of
EFB is represented by the gray dot. As shown in Figure 3, the combustion model is valid because the
difference between the model and experimental results was insignificant.

to MC.

2.3.2 Boiler Efficiency
The HHV of EFB
obtained from the combustion model represented the heat generated
when EFBs were completely burned; however, during actual combustion
the high MC lowers the combustion temperature, causing incomplete
combustion. This results in several thermal losses and reduces the
amount of heat transferred to produce high-temperature, high-pressure
steam. This study applied known boiler efficiencies according to the
MC of wood to the process model.5 For flue
gas at 200 °C, the actual heat transferred considering flue gas
loss and chemical and mechanical unburned carbon losses could be presented
as 18  where ηboiler and xm denote the boiler efficiency
and the MC of
wood, respectively.

2.4 Steam Cycle
2.4.1 Steam Cycle Model
The steam cycle
process shown in Figure 1 shows that 47 °C, 2 atm FW is raised to 12 atm by pump 1 and
enters the FW preheat tank, where it is preheated by completely condensed
water from the air heat exchange. The preheated water is then raised
to 67 atm by pump 2, and this high-pressure water enters the boiler
where it is converted to steam (433 °C, 60 atm). The high-temperature,
high-pressure steam then turns the turbine, and a portion is recirculated
to heat the air. After 10 MW electricity is produced, the steam exiting
the turbine is discharged at 47 °C, 0.107 atm and is completely
condensed by the condenser. This condensed water (45 °C, 2 atm)
is returned to the pump and recirculated. The turbine efficiency was
set at 90%; the pump and blower efficiency was set at 75%.

2.4.2 Net Power Generation
The net power
generation (Wnet) was set to 10 MW considering
the detracting work done by the pumps (Wblower) and blower (Wpump), as shown in eq 19. The amount of EFB required
to generate 10 MW power was automatically calculated by the process
model. 19  

2.5 Summary
Tables S1–S3 summarize the design values of process modeling. Table S1 shows the inlet specifications for each
stream in Figure 1, Table S2 presents the outlet specification for
each unit, and Table S3 indicates the Le, Sc, and Re values
required to obtain the convective mass- and heat-transfer coefficients.
As mentioned in Section 2.2.2, the δG, ηG, ρG, and λG values required to obtain Le, Sc, and Re were obtained
by stream analysis. The equation for obtaining each parameter is given
in eqs 10–17. The variables shown in Table S1 are values that vary according to the drying time and steam
recirculation ratio. These values are automatically derived from the
Aspen Plus Design Spec. As for the air 1 variable, heat was released
when the steam (191 °C, 12 atm) that was partially emitted in
the turbine was condensed at 189 °C and 12 atm. The air 1 volume
was automatically calculated when air 1 (30 °C, 1 atm) met the
condition (188 °C, 1 atm) for this heat. Similarly, with regard
to the FW variable, the amount of heat generated depended on hot air
from the combustion of EFB in the furnace that was discharged to the
flue gas (200 °C, 1 atm). Using this heat, the water (188 °C,
67 atm) that passed through pump 1 became steam (433 °C, 60 atm)
in the boiler. A net power generation of 10 MW was achieved as this
steam passed turbine 1 and turbine 2, and the amount of EFB and water
required were automatically calculated by Design Spec. In the case
of air 2, the excess air ratio was set at 1.6, and the amount of air
injected to maintain the excess air ratio of 1.6 was automatically
changed according to the amount of EFB. This allowed the organically
connected variables to be automatically calculated even as the drying
time and steam recirculation ratio changed.

3 Case Studies
3.1 Objective Function
The objective
function for optimal drying point is to minimize the annual total
cost (ATC) of the biomass plant. ATC is the calculated sum of annual
equipment cost (AEC) and annual operating cost (AOC) and is shown
in eq 22, while the
constraints applied to the process include air 1 preheating to 181
°C, air 2 flow rate maintaining the excess air ratio of 1.6,
and amount of FW and EFB flow rate satisfying 10 MW power generation.
Assuming depreciation over the 20 year lifespan of a power plant,
AEC were estimated by eq 20. The AOC were calculated by eq 21, multiplying the EFB fuel cost by the annual
number of operating days and the EFB (MC, 60%) mass flow rate (ṁEFB,60%). The fuel price was contracted
with local Indonesian EFB suppliers as 14.08 $/ton. 20   21   22  where Cdryer, Cshredder, Cfurnace, and Chex are the equipment cost of
dryer, shredder, furnace, and heat exchanger, respectively. Because
AEC are influenced by various factors such as usage, capacity, and
materials, they must be roughly estimated. The total capital investment
in the power plant neglected labor costs, installation costs, transportation
costs, and pipeline installation costs but included the cost of equipment
affected by the amount of EFB: the dryer, shredder, heat exchanger,
and furnace. Turbines were not considered because they remained the
same at 10 MW power generation, and details such as pump blowers were
ignored. The equipment cost estimate equation for dryers, shredders,
and heat exchanger was developed in 2003, whereas the furnace cost
equation was developed in 2002.30,31Equations 27–29 reflect
the cost index in 2017.32

The dryer
cost was influenced by the lateral surface area of the dryer (Adryer).31 If the
EFB (MC, 48%) mass flow rate (ṁEFB,48%) and drying time are known prior to dryer area estimates, the dryer
volume (Vdryer) can be estimated. It was
assumed that EFBs would occupy 20% of the dryer volume with a density
of 500 kg/m3. If the EFBs do not shrink during the drying
process, the dryer volume occupied by EFBs is represented by eq 23.21 The volume of solid in the dryer (Vs) is affected by time as well as the EFB feed rate. 23  

When the dryer operates at a 20% load, the
dryer volume is calculated
by eq 24. The L/D ratio of the dryer should be known
to determine the area of the dryer. As typical rotary dryers have
a length to diameter (L/D) ratio
of 4–10.33 The selected L/D ratio in this study was 7, the average
value. The dryer diameter can be expressed by a volume equation such
as eq 25, after which
the area is calculated by eq 26. 24   25   26   27  

The shredder, which crushes EFBs into 5 mm
pieces, was a hammer
mill. The relation between the shredder, EFB (MC, 60%) mass flow rate,
and equipment cost was estimated by eq 28. 28  

The type of heat
exchanger was selected as air-cooled (finned-tube),
which raises the air temperature entering the dryer. The heat exchanger
cost is a function of area (Ahex), which
can be calculated as eq 29. TLM is a log mean temperature difference,
which is obtained from inlet and outlet temperature of the fluids
when being heat exchanged. The overall heat-transfer coefficient (U) was typically 700–850 W/m2 K, and the
mean value was used.34 The cost of heat
exchanger was represented by eq 30. 29   30  

Only combustion was considered in furnace costs, ignoring
detailed
costs such as piping, steam drums, soot blowers, fans, deaerators,
and pumps included in the boiler. Furnace costs varied according to
the heat-transfer rate (H) and were estimated using eq 31. Finally, we summarize
the parameters for the objective function in Table 3. 31

3.2 Case Study Description
Case studies
were conducted to optimize power of 10 MW using the objective function
of the process model mentioned above. The most efficient (case A)
and most inefficient (case B) conditions among various circumstances,
which evaporate the moisture of EFBs to 20%, were compared to save
ATC of real power plant currently being constructed in Indonesia,
which reduce the MC of EFBs from 48 to 20%. Furthermore, given only
the most efficient drying conditions which satisfy several MCs such
as 15, 25, 30, and 35%, the optimal point was investigated. Herein,
case 1, case 2, case 3, and case 4 corresponded to the extent of drying
performed to MC 15, 25, 30, and 35%, respectively. Measurements were
carried out by altering the steam recirculation ratio (0–0.43)
and drying time (1–60 min) to identify the optimum combination.
In all cases, EFBs (MC, 60%) were processed by the shredder into 5
mm particles with 48% MC. The base case, in which EFB from the shredder
was used as fuel without drying, produced 10 MW of electricity.

4 Results and Discussion
The results were derived
from the case studies of designed model. Figure 4 shows a contour
image of the annual cost required to generate 10 MW power when the
steam recirculation ratio and drying time are varied. Figure 5 represents the MC of the dried
EFB in the same range. Table 4 summarizes the detailed results for several cases as well
as cost savings. Besides, the heat and mass balance results for the
cases are provided in Figures S1 and Tables S4–S11 of the Supporting Information. In the base case, the
hot air mass flow rate is zero; this is because the steam recirculation
ratio used for drying is zero. To produce 10 MW of electric power,
approximately 19,784 kg/h of 60% MC EFB was required; however, the
shredder produced 15,219 kg/h. Without considering the energy used
in the drying process, the amount of work required to operate the
steam cycle was 71 kW.

The case A, case B, dots, and triangles in Figure 4 show the points
where the MC of the dried
EFB reached 20%, indicating that there are many drying conditions
capable of satisfying the desired EFB of 20% MC. If you see Figure 4 with Figure 5, it helps you to understand
easily. The triangle indicates that the relative air humidity reached
nearly 100%, preventing efficient moisture evaporation even for prolonged
drying times. Although the triangle with a shorter drying time has
higher MC than those with longer ones, these differences may be disregarded
and the MCs considered as 20% because the discrepancies are only one
decimal point different. Among these, cases A and B represent the
most efficient and most inefficient conditions, respectively. The
MCs of cases A and B were approximately equal to those of the other
conditions but demonstrated large differences in cost savings. This
indicates that the drying method is more important than the amount
of drying.

Cases 1, 2, 3, and 4 represent the most efficient
conditions satisfying
MC requirements of 15, 25, 30, and 35%, respectively. In Figure 4, the star represents
the optimal point of the annual cost graph. At this optimal point,
the steam recirculation ratio, drying time, and MC of the dried EFBs
were 0.25, 23 min, and 9.91%, respectively. Table 4 shows the data for each case. As shown by
the optimum cost savings points in cases 1, 2, 3, 4, and A, drying
EFBs to the optimum point incurred the least cost. However, there
were no significant differences in cost savings compared to optimal
EFB drying conditions at 10–20% MC if only the most efficient
drying conditions were considered. The differences at over 20% MC
were significant.

5 Conclusions
An EFB-based
10 MW power plant process model created in Aspen Plus
was used to optimize the drying process. The model considered the
drying kinetics according to EFB material properties. The Q̇˙ and Ṁ˙ values calculated from the drying kinetics
were used to obtain the dryer material and energy balance as well
as the EFB evaporation behavior over time. This model has a trade-off
among steam, drying time, capital investment, and operating costs
for drying. The optimal drying conditions were found to be 0.25 ratio,
23 min, and 9.91%, respectively. The optimization graph shows that
approximately equal MCs can be obtained under different conditions;
however, the cost savings differ. This indicates that the drying method
is more important than the extent of drying performed. It was further
observed that the use of 20% MC EFB is viable when only optimal operating
conditions are considered for drying because the cost is not significantly
reduced.
