Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) has proven to be a powerful tool
for the characterization and investigation of in situ chemical reactions.
This is more relevant when dealing with complex systems, where the
spatial distribution of the species, partition equilibrium, flow patterns,
among other factors have a determining effect over mass transport
and therefore over the reaction rate. The advantage of MRI is that
it provides spatial information in a noninvasive way and does not
require any molecular sensor or sample extraction. In this work, MRI
is used to fully characterize an electrochemical reaction under forced
hydrodynamic conditions. Reaction rates, flow patterns, and quantitative
concentration of the chemical species involved are spatially monitored
in situ in a complex system that involves metallic pieces and a heterogeneous
cementation reaction. Experimental data are compared with numerical
simulations.

Introduction
Understanding the course
of electrochemical reactions involves
an in-depth study not only of the electron transfer events that take
place but also of the vast number of factors that affect that process.
In complex systems, the spatial distribution of the species, partition
equilibrium, flow patterns, among others have a determining effect
over mass transport, therefore over the reaction rate. Magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) has proven to be a noninvasive, powerful, and versatile
tool to monitor a wide variety of chemical processes.1−3 In the last few years, several studies have used MRI to monitor
chemical processes in situ, leveraging its ability to provide spatial
information about the system.4−7

However, monitoring electrochemical reactions
brings up several
technical obstacles that need to be overcome. The most evident is
the presence of metallic pieces, such as electrodes, in the interior
of the magnet; resulting in magnetic field inhomogeneities in the
vicinity of the metal. These inhomogeneities interfere with the well-defined
linear magnetic field gradients, which are used for spatial encoding
during MRI, and this essentially leads to distortions in the final
image. It has been shown that these image defects can be minimized
by aligning the metallic parts of the electrochemical cell parallel
to the static magnetic (B0) field of the
magnetic resonance imager and the RF (B1) field, that is, lying in the plane defined by both fields.8 However, it is not always possible to modify
the cell design without affecting its performance.

Image artifacts
are also dependent on the pulse sequence employed,
where spin echo-based sequences have shown to be more robust in medical
applications when metal parts are involved.9,10 However,
the minimum acquisition time using this pulse sequence is around a
few minutes. There are other pulse sequences that allow obtaining
images in less than 1 s, for instance, rapid acquisition relaxation
(RARE) and echo planar imaging (EPI) sequences are among the best
known.11−13 Yet, configurations based on a gradient echo such
as the EPI sequence are very sensitive to the presence of metallic
structures, whereas the sequences based on a spin echo, such as the
spin eco and RARE, apply refocusing pulses that correct the field
inhomogeneity throughout the sample. The RARE sequence was recently
used to provide insights into mass transfer processes in a chemical
reaction by MRI in real time, where freely diffusing ions in solution
were mapped during the electro-dissolution of copper.14 Although there is a vast amount of systems where species
transport occurs only by diffusion, in several technological applications,
mass transport is enhanced by mixing, stirring, or kneading. The implementation
of this technique under the presence of flow requires that the excited
volume does not move significantly during the acquisition of the image,
which limits the application of this sequence to several systems where
high velocities or nonideal flow patterns are present. This is the
main reason why, to the best of our knowledge, MRI has been so far
used to monitor electrochemical reactions where only diffusive mass
transport was present and in constant motion throughout the acquisition
time.

We have proved that velocity MRI is a useful tool to characterize
the velocity profiles that take place in the interior of a rotating
disk electrode (RDE) cell.15−17 Electrochemical cells with a
RDE configuration are widely used to characterize electrochemical
reactions.18−20 It can be used to measure the stoichiometric number
of electron transfer in the electrochemical reaction, bulk concentration
and diffusion coefficient, reaction kinetic constant and reaction
intermediates in studying electrode reaction kinetics and mechanisms.
RDE is easy to construct with a variety of electrode materials, and
it is amenable to rigorous theoretical treatment. The former attribute
makes it interesting for its study with computational methods.21 In this setup, mass transfer and the associated
velocity profiles near the electrode play a main role in the analysis
of the information obtained. The spinning disk drags the fluid at
its surface along with it and, because of centrifugal force, flings
the solution outward from the center in a radial direction. The fluid
at the disk surface is replenished by a flow normal to the surface.
Our previous studies were made to fully understand the mass transport
processes that take place under forced hydrodynamic conditions. The
aim of this paper is to use MRI to monitor a chemical reaction under
forced hydrodynamic conditions, where a convective flow pattern is
generated and metallic parts are present. As a model reaction, we
chose the cementation of copper over a zinc plate, not only for its
simplicity but also due to its high impact over hydrometallurgical
process. Cementation is one of the oldest hydrometallurgical techniques,
and it is applied in wide variety of industrial areas or effluent
treatments.22−25 In general, this is a single displacement reaction that involves
a reductive precipitation of a metal ion from a solution through a
series of galvanic reactions, in which electrons are transferred from
the less noble metal through the growing metallic deposit. Because
during the reaction, a solid deposit is formed, this implies that
the geometry of the system is modified and so could be the mass transport
patterns in the RDE cell. In this way, MRI is a promising tool that
will allow us to monitor not only the reaction course but also the
spatial codification of all of the species involved, as well as its
flow pattern.

Results and Discussion
Imaging Artifact Minimization
It is well-known that
the impact of artifacts caused by metallic objects depends mainly
on the relationship between the geometry of interest and the orientation
of the object relative to the magnet’s magnetic field (B0) direction.26 The
main field strength plays a less important role, but its orientation
depends on the type of imager. When dealing with metallic electrodes,
the main cause of the artifacts is the difference in the magnetic
susceptibility and Foucault currents induced either when the gradient
coils are turned on or by the radiofrequency field, B1.

Because of differences in the magnetic susceptibility,
local field inhomogeneities are generated, which give rise to several
geometric distortions in the read direction, disturbances in the excited
slice, and signal intensity variations. As expected, metals with higher
magnetic susceptibilities produce bigger defects in the image. Therefore,
nonmetallic electrodes or zinc and copper are the elements of choice
in these applications.

The image distortions produced by a Zn
plate were studied. The
use of rectangular plates as electrodes for the study of electrochemical
reactions has been previously studied,5,27 where it was
shown that the distortions are minimized when orienting the plates
with the direction of the radiofrequency field B1. However, in the RDE configuration, the electrode is placed
on the base of an insulating material rod, which rotates at a given
angular frequency. Emulating this arrangement, a Zn plate was placed
on the base of the rod (see Figure 1a) in order to evaluate the image distortions produced
in the system. In this configuration, the orientation of the disk
is perpendicular to B0, whereas the normal
to the metal surface is perpendicular to B1 (applied in the x–y plane).

the position of the Zn plate. (b) MRI of distilled water in the RDE
with the Zn plate. Two slices are shown, a x–y plane (left image) where a slice close to the rod is selected;
and a z–y plane (right) in
the center of the cell along the x direction. No
significant image alterations are observed close to the metal.

Images of the cell filled with
distilled water are shown in Figure 1b. To monitor possible
artifacts in several image directions, different planes were acquired
using the pulse sequence described in the Supporting Information. On the left of Figure 1b, the x–y plane of the cell is shown. For this purpose, a slice
of 3 mm thickness was selected along the z direction
and centered on the base of the rotating rod. On the other hand, a z–y plane of 3 mm thickness along x is shown on the right. In both images, it is clearly observed
that in this configuration, the presence of the zinc disk does not
produce distortions in the image.

Relaxation Contrast
NMR provides several ways to monitor
chemical reactions. Spectroscopy is one of the preferred techniques
when determining the concentrations of reactants as the reactions
proceed.28−30 However, this is only possible when the chemical
species involved in the electrochemical reaction have NMR active nuclei,
such as 1H, 7Li, or 23Na, among others.31−33 With these nuclei, it is also possible to study complex systems
by MRI.7,27 Another strategy for the mapping of chemical
reactions is through the determination of local changes in the systems
relaxation rates. For instance, because of the electronic configuration
d9, Cu2+ cations are paramagnetic, so the relaxation
the NMR signals of 1H of water molecules in the solution
is significantly modified. The ionic species involved in the studied
redox reaction are described by chemical eq 1 1  

As the cementation reaction proceeds,
the concentration of the paramagnetic cation decreases and the solvent
molecule relaxation time increases.34 If
no other paramagnetic species are generated, the solution relaxation
time T1 can be used as a useful parameter
to monitor the redox reaction. Figure 2 shows the linear dependency between [Cu2+] and the relaxivity R1 = 1/T1 in solutions with concentrations ranging from 0 (pure
water) to 25 mM CuSO4. Because in the chemical reaction
between Cu2+ and Zn, the generated Zn2+ is not
paramagnetic and the linear fitting of the plot can be used to monitor
the cementation evolution. The difference in the relaxation times
can also be used as a contrast mechanism in MRI, where the signal
intensity in an image pixel is proportional to the T1 value and to the transverse relaxation time T2 that accounts for the magnetization evolution
during the imaging period (see the Supporting Information). This allows the monitoring of the spatial distribution
of metal ions in the sample, as the cementation reaction proceeds.

(R1) as a function of the
cupric ion concentration.

Monitoring Chemical Reaction Evolution
As a first step,
the overall chemical reaction kinetics is determined by changes in
the relaxation time of the RDE cell as a whole. That is, MRI is not
yet performed, whereas the signal corresponds to the whole cell. The
reaction evolution under convective flow was monitored by means of
changes in the relaxation times T1. A
rotating rod with a Zn plate attached at its base was immersed in
a 25 mM CuSO4 solution. Several rotation speeds were tested,
ranging from 0 to 94.2 Hz. As the reaction proceeds, the relaxation
time of the solvent increases reaching a final value of T1 = 1.9 s, which is similar to that of the pure water,
evidencing that the generated Zn2+ has a lesser effect
over the solution T1 value. Figure 3a shows how the global Cu2+ concentration decreases as the cementation process proceeds.
It has been reported by several authors that cementation reactions
follow first-order kinetics.35−37 Thus, the following expression
is valid 2  where k is a first-order
rate constant, t is the time, C0 is the initial Cu2+ concentration, and CCu2+(t) is the average
Cu2+ concentration for the whole cell as a function of
time. Figure 3b shows
the first-order linearization of the data in Figure 3a according to eq 2.

Figure 3 Reaction monitoring by means of the relaxation
time T1. (a) Cupric ion concentration
variation at different
rotation speeds and (b) same after the first-order linearization. k values are obtained from the linear fit of (b). Data obtained
from the reaction at 94.2 Hz are not shown for clarity because it
overlaps with data obtained at 62.8 Hz.

As expected, the reaction rate increases with the rotational
speed.23,24,37−39 This can be
attributed to a decrease in the diffusion layer thickness, which yields
a more efficient Cu2+ transport rate from the solution
bulk to the metal surface.

From the first-order plots, it is
possible to determine the reaction
rate constant by simply applying a linear fit. It can also be observed
that for lower rotational speeds, the late stages of the cementation
behavior deviate from first-order kinetics because of the prevalence
of mass transport by diffusional control. The reaction rate values
thus obtained are reported in Table 1, where it can be observed that the cementation rate
increases as the rotational speed increases. However, a maximum value
of 2.5 h–1 is reached at 62.8 Hz, and a further
increase in the rotational speed does not substantially affect the
reaction rate.

For the
RDE configuration, the Levich equation describes the current
response of mass transfer limited electrochemical reactions.19,40 This equation41 that includes Cochran’s
approximate analytical solution42 for the
fluid velocities assumes that the depth of the cell and the rotating
plane are infinite and the thickness of the electrode is negligible.
The dimensions of the cell are considered infinitely large, thus avoiding
the rebound of the fluid against the walls of the same. From it, an
expression for the mass transfer coefficient km (in m s–1) can be deduced19 3  where D is the diffusion
coefficient of the reactant species and v represents
the kinematic viscosity of the solution. Additionally, as shown by
multiple authors,24,35,39,43,44 the first-order
rate constant k (in s–1) can be
expressed in terms of km as 4  where V is the solution volume
and A is the effective area of the Zn plate. Thus 5  

For the purposes of this work, AV–1 will be kept as an adjustable characteristic
reciprocal length.
Finite element method simulations were carried out in order to validate
this dependence, and results are detailed in the electronic Supporting Information.

The first-order
rate constant was calculated by averaging the concentration
over the whole of the solution, linearizing, and fitting a linear
function. In all cases, the fit was very satisfactory (r2 ≥ 0.9999), which corroborates that the reaction
is first-order with respect to CCu2+.

In order to validate eq 5, simulations were carried out for different rotational
velocities,
kinematic viscosities, and diffusion coefficients. Then, k was plotted as a function of the reduced parameter v–1/6D2/3Ω1/2 for different sets of kinematic viscosities, diffusion
coefficients, and rotational speeds (Figure 4). As can be seen, the linear behavior of
these plots validates the use of this equation for this system.

results used to validate the use of eq 5. Rate constant as a function of
the reduced parameter v–1/6D2/3Ω1/2 and corresponding linear
fit. Each of the three parameters was varied while keeping the other
two constants. v was varied from 3.3 × 10–7 to 3.8 × 10–6 m2 s–1 (white circles). D was varied
from 3 × 10–10 to 1.3 × 10–8 m2 s–1 (black circles). Ω was
varied from 6.3 to 94 Hz (gray circles). When constant, parameters
were kept at: D = 1 × 10–9 m2 s–1, v = 1.0097
× 10–6 m2 s–1,
and Ω = 62.8 rad s–1. Fitting parameters: r2 = 0.99989, intercept = v =
9.51 × 10–6 s–1, slope =
2.15 m–1.

Additionally, useful parameters can be obtained from the
computer
simulation which are inaccessible in MRI experiments. For instance,
a current can be defined, even if no external circuit is present.
It can be interpreted as the amount of charge transferred per unit
time between the Zn and Cu species. From the simulations, this current, iL, can be obtained as 6  where n is the number of
exchanged electrons, F is the Faraday constant, and rZn is the Zn plate radius. The argument in this
integral is the flux of Cu2+ ions toward the interface.
This current can be compared with that predicted by the Levich equation 7  where A is the plate area
and C*(t) is the average concentration
in the cell; in this case, it is a function of time because the reactant
is consumed as the reaction proceeds. The importance of this equation
lies in that it links the interfacial processes to the average concentrations
throughout the cell of cupric ion. Thus, km can be obtained from the slope of the plot of iL as a function of average concentration and compared
with its analytical expression (eq 3). A computer simulation was carried out matching the
parameters with the experimental conditions (v =
1.0097 × 10–6 m2 s–1, D = 0.583 × 10–9 m2 s–1, Ω = 62.8 Hz). For the determination
of the mass transfer coefficient from eq 7, the current iL(t) was calculated by integrating the CCu2+ flux perpendicular to the Zn plate in the revolved
geometry and multiplying the result by nF. Figure 5 shows the plot of
current as a function of average concentration; for later simulation
times, a straight line is obtained. After discarding the data corresponding
to early stage, linear regression yields a km value of 1.12 × 10–5 m s–1.

Figure 5 Current, according to eq 6, as a function of average concentration throughout the cell.
The linearized slope corresponds to kmnF A. Fitting parameters: r2 = 0.99997, intercept: −5.0 × 10–7 A, slope: 6.11 × 10–6 A mM–1.

For these parameters, eq 3 yields a value of 1.08
× 10–5 m s–1. This 3.7% mismatch
can be attributed to the fact
that the concentration is not completely homogeneous throughout the
cell and that the Levich equation is not completely valid for small
cells. The value of k was determined for these conditions
to be 3.48 × 10–5 s–1. From eq 4, AV–1, the adjustable characteristic reciprocal length,
was calculated to be 3.42 m–1.

This good agreement
confirms that km, as calculated from eq 3, is a valid parameter
to characterize mass transport in systems
involving cementation under forced hydrodynamic conditions. The corresponding
values for the performed experiments are presented in Table 1.

Figure 6 shows the
cementation rate constants as obtained from experiments plotted as
a function of the square root of Ω. It can be observed that
the linear dependence is not maintained for rotational speeds higher
than 62.8 Hz.

Figure 6 Variations of rate constant (k) obtained
for various
rotation speeds (Ω) as a function of the square root of the
disc rotation speed. The gray line is a guide to the eye.

The deviation from the linear behavior at higher
rotational speeds
indicates that in these conditions, eq 5 is not valid. This could be attributed to two main
causes: first, the assumption that mass transport is the limiting
factor at such high rotational speeds might not be completely valid,
as electron transfer becomes a limiting factor in the reaction rate.
Second, we have previously shown by means of velocity MRI experiments
that rotational speeds above 62 Hz lead to the formation of vortices
and the fluid dynamics within this cell deviate from ideal behavior.15,16 In particular, the velocity profile in the z direction
shows that the velocity of the fluid going from the bulk reservoir
to the electrode surface increases with rotational speed, but the
streamlines lose the homogeneous and parallel distribution because
of the formation of vortices, as shown in Figure 7. It can be observed that at high rotational
speeds, the material does not arrive to the metal surface in a homogeneous
way, with faster dynamics in the borders of the rod and slower velocities
in the center, in concordance with previous results.45 Thus, reaction rates deviate from those predicted by eq 5 because it is formulated
assuming an ideal fluid dynamics, considering laminar flow and velocities
tangential to the metallic disc.

Figure 7 Velocity maps and streamlines of a RDE
for different rotational
speeds. Color plot shows the values of velocities in the z direction, whereas streamlines are built from the data of z and y velocities.

MRI Visualization of a Chemical Reaction
We now turn
our attention to the determination of velocity profile information.
Although the pulse sequence described in the previous section showed
to be robust to the effects produced by metallic materials, the minimum
acquisition time for an image is 1 min. Because the reaction rate
increases with the frequency of rotation of the rod, it was decided
to use a low rotation frequency for these MRI experiments, in order
to be able to monitor all of the possible details in the acquired
images. Several aspects must be considered in the pulse sequence implementation
when dealing with the determination of flow with MRI. Whilst a detailed
description of the pulse sequence is provided in the Supporting Information, here we mention the basic points to
be considered. The basic idea is to determine changes in the phase
of the NMR signal in a given section of space, namely, a voxel. It
is important during the acquisition time that the monitored molecules
do not move more than half the distance of the voxel. This imposes
a maximum velocity to be encoded. On the other hand, codification
is carried out by the application of a pair of bipolar magnetic field
gradient pulses. The amplitude and duration of these pulses determine
the so-called field of flow. The hardware limitation set for these
parameters determines the accuracy in the determination of low velocities.
It is clear that the particular flow patterns and hardware must be
carefully tuned for an optimum acquisition. A thorough discussion
for the particular setup used in this work may be found in ref (15). After choosing the proper
parameters for image acquisition (see the Supporting Information for a further details), the cementation process
was monitored every 90 s over a period of 1.3 h. Image intensities
were transformed to Cu2+ concentration maps, as shown in Figure 8 for a series of
representative reaction times.

Figure 8 Cu2+ concentration maps at
different reaction times.

The distribution of Cu2+ is not homogeneous through
the volume of the cell. The higher concentrations are observed to
be near the electrode surface, whereas a lower concentration is present
in the recirculation areas. At t = 3150 s, solid
copper that has been deposited at the bottom of the cell is observed.
Because the speeds in the lower part of the cell are minimal, the
precipitated copper remains immobile during the experiments. As the
reaction develops, the concentration of Cu2+ ions decreases
in a large part of the volume of the solution. The combination of
the velocity maps (Figure 7) and cupric ion concentration maps (Figure 8) obtained by MRI provides insight into the
mass transport phenomena that takes place and the consequent chemical
reaction. The streamlines denoted in Figure 7 show how liquid flows inside the cell. By
comparing it with Figure 8, it can be seen that the solution that moves from the bottom
of the cell to the electrode has a high Cu2+ concentration,
whereas the borders and the vortices in the upper part have a lower
concentration. MRI evidences how the paramagnetic ions travel from
the bottom of the cell toward the electrode and then react to generate
Zn2+ ions, which are expelled to the sides of the cell
and mixed with the remaining Cu2+ solution. Then, the solution
recirculates in a new cycle from the sides to the bottom and up to
the Zn plate, until the reaction is over.

The distribution of
reactant arising from the convective–diffusive
mass transport can be interpreted more clearly from the concentration
profiles at the center of the cell, extracted from the Cu2+ maps, which are shown in Figure 9. The position d = 0 corresponds to
the location of the Zn plate. The concentration profiles show a decrease
in Cu2+ ions for d = 0. This behavior
agrees with the work presented by Alexiadis et al.,21 where a model reaction is simulated in an RDE cell under
forced hydrodynamic conditions.

Figure 9 (Left) Cu2+ concentration profiles,
taken from the center
of the cell along the axial direction d, during the
course of the reaction. The selected times are 270 s (black), 3150
s (green), 3690 s (blue), and 4500 s (orange). (right) Schematic representation
of the electrochemical cell indicating the dimension d, where d = 0 corresponds to the Zn plate.

In order to monitor the distribution
of the reactant species as
a function of time, the concentrations associated with the immediate
vicinity of the Zn plate (d = 0.313 mm) and for a
point at the center of the cell (d = 7 mm) as a function
of time are shown in Figure 10a. For times lower than 540 s, the concentrations of Cu2+ ions near the rod and in the lower part of the cell have
similar values, within the noise level of the experiment. After this
time, the concentrations associated with both positions decrease in
a rate similar to the concentration curves shown in Figure 3 for Ω = 6.3 Hz. However,
for times above 540 s, it is possible to appreciate a decrease in
the concentration of Cu2+ for d = 0.313
mm that is maintained throughout the observation time of the reaction.
For times longer than 5000 s, the acquired images show the accumulation
of copper on the surface of the Zn disk. As a result, the concentration
values obtained for times greater than 4500 s were discarded.

Figure 10 (a) Cu2+ concentration variation at d = 0.313 mm
(black) and 7 mm (gray) along the central axis of the
cell for Ω = 6.3 Hz, obtained by MRI and (b) numerical simulations.
Lines in (a) are a guide to the eye.

To compare the results, numerical simulations were performed
considering
a simple surface reaction 8  where A represents Cu2+ and Q represents Zn2+ ion. The
distribution of the species A in the system can be
calculated by solving the combined diffusion and convection mass transport
differential equation 9  where c and D are the concentration and the diffusion
coefficient of A. The fluid velocity (u⃗) is obtained by
numerically solving the Navier–Stokes equation, considering
the whole volume of the cell. To solve eq 9, a rapid and complete reaction is assumed.
Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were used to solve the Navier–Stokes
equations of flow motion for a RDE cell under convective flow, with
similar dimensions and parameters as the used for NMR measurements.

As can be seen, the results obtained by MRI are in agreement with
those provided by numerical simulations (Figure 10b). For reaction times below 380 s, both
positions show the same concentration value. After this period, the
concentration drops in the vicinity of the electrode, whereas in the
middle part of the cell, it decays at a slower rate. It is worth to
mention that the decay rates obtained by means of MRI are faster than
those from CFD. This may be attributed mainly to the idealized model
involved in the numerical simulation and, in a lesser extent, to the
fact that MRI data are an average over a voxel size (0.313 mm ×
0.625 mm × 3 mm), whereas CFD provides data corresponding to
a single point. The effect of the magnetic field over the reaction
is another factor that the numerical simulation is not taking into
account, but it has been reported that is not dominant over the main
mass transport process, which in this case is mainly governed by the
flow velocities in the cell.46

Conclusions
In this paper, we have explored the possibility of monitoring a
chemical reaction in situ under forced hydrodynamic conditions by
NMR and MRI. In first place, the artifacts generated in images by
NMR due to the presence of metallic objects were studied. It was observed
that the presence of a metallic disk with its normal parallel to the
static field, B0 and perpendicular to
the radiofrequency field B1, does not
generate appreciable distortions in the images acquired using a spin
echo sequence. The copper cementation in an RDE configuration was
characterized for different frequencies of rotation, and the rate
of the reaction is affected by the flow pattern. Finally, the reaction
process was visualized by MRI, acquiring 2D images to obtain maps
of Cu2+ ions concentration as the reaction developed.

It is shown that the reaction occurs in a localized manner in the
regions near the Zn disk, in agreement with the behavior observed
in numerical simulations. The pulse sequence used for the experiments
is fast enough to capture the moment in which the concentrations associated
with the regions near the electrode and the rest of the volume of
the solution diverge from each other. However, it may not be fast
enough for faster processes or for higher rotation speeds. In the
future, this issue could be addressed using a fast sequence of images
such as the RARE sequence along with the implementation of the compressed
sensing method. It will allow the reconstruction of quantitative concentration
maps from sub-sampled images, as was recently demonstrated.47,48

Materials and Methods
All experiments were carried out at
7.05 T (v0 = 300.13 MHz for 1H) in a vertical Oxford superconducting
magnet operated with a Kea2 (Magritek GmbH) console. A 3D gradient
coil system (Bruker GmbH) with maximum gradients of 1.5T/m was used. Radiofrequency excitation and detection
were carried out with a 25 mm inner diameter Bruker GmbH birdcage
coil with a length of 37 mm with radiofrequency power driven by a
100 W Tomco amplifier. The system schematized in Figure 1a was built from acrylic and
used in all of the experiments. The exterior cylinder with internal
radius R2 = 7 mm is static, whereas the
inner cylinder with radius R1 = 3 mm can
rotate. A Zn disc with the same radius is placed in the bottom of
this rod. The height of the cell was H1 = 10 mm and H2 = 14 mm.

All of
the pulse programs and MRI data processing were made using
Magritek Prospa software. T1 relaxation
times were measured using the saturation recovery sequence described
in Figure S2. For these experiments, 32
points logarithmically spaced were acquired and sequence parameters
were set to: τ* = 100 ms, 90° pulse duration = 300 μs,
and a repetition time of 300 ms. T1 and
Cu2+ concentration maps were acquired employing the pulse
sequence depicted in Figure S2, where a
3 mm slice along the x direction was excited. The
field of view was set to 40 mm × 20 mm and matrices of 128 ×
32 points were collected, resulting in a spatial resolution of 0.313
mm × 0.625 mm × 3 mm. For all imaging experiments, four
signal acquisitions were collected and averaged. The most relevant
parameters of the pulse sequence (Figure S3) were the following: echo time tE =
8 ms, τ* = 100 μs, τ = 240 μs, hard 90°
and 180° pulse duration p1 = 250
μs, and soft 90° pulse duration of p2 = 700 μs. Velocity maps were performed using the sequence
presented in Figure S1, where velocity-encoded
gradients were applied for a time δ = 1 ms, separated by a time
delay Δ = 2.2 ms.

Numerical simulations were performed
using the finite element method
as implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics. The simulations were carried
out in a 2D model representing a 3D system with cylindrical symmetry.
The geometry of the cell matched the experimental cell geometry. Two
coupled processes were incorporated in the simulations: on the one
hand fluid dynamics, and on the other hand mass transport and chemical
reaction. In a first stage, a time-dependent CFD simulation is carried
out in order to obtain the fluid velocity field, u⃗. This is accomplished by solving the continuity and Navier–Stokes
equations for an incompressible, isothermal flow at low Mach number.
Viscosity and density parameters corresponding to pure water were
used unless otherwise mentioned. In this CFD model, the flow is laminar.
No-slip boundary conditions are imposed at the boundaries corresponding
to the cell walls and bottom. Rotational boundary conditions are considered
at the bottom of the rod and at the shaft of the inner cylinder. In
a second stage, mass transport for Cu2+ is solved by taking
into account diffusion and convection. In order to emulate a mass
transport limited reaction, CCu2+ was fixed at 0 at the bottom of the rod. Further details about
the model can be found in the Supporting Information.
