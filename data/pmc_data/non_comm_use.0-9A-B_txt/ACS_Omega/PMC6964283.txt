In this study, an inkjet bioprinting-based high-throughput
screening
(HTS) system was designed and applied for the first time to a catecholpyrimidine-based
small molecule library to find hit compounds that inhibit c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase1 (JNK1). JNK1 kinase, inactivated MAPKAPK2,
and specific fluorescent peptides along with bioink were printed on
parchment paper under optimized printing conditions that did not allow
rapid evaporation of printed media based on Triton-X and glycerol.
Subsequently, different small compounds were printed and tested against
JNK1 kinase to evaluate their degree of phosphorylation inhibition.
After printing and incubation, fluorescence intensities from the phosphorylated/nonphosphorylated
peptide were acquired for the % phosphorylation analysis. The IM50 (inhibitory mole 50) value was determined as 1.55 ×
10–15 mol for the hit compound, 22.
Thus, this work demonstrated that inkjet bioprinting-based HTS can
potentially be adopted for the drug discovery process using small
molecule libraries, and cost-effective HTS can be expected to be established
based on its low nano- to picoliter printing volume.

==== Body
Introduction
High-throughput screening (HTS) of small
molecule libraries is
highly influential in the discovery of hit compounds because it is
the starting point in the development of commercial drugs.1 Successful HTS techniques that are routinely
used in the discovery process include time-resolved fluorescence resonance
energy transfer (FRET),2,3 fluorescence polarization/anisotropy,4,5 alpha Screen,6 scintillation proximity
assay,7 chemi-luminescence,8 and cell-free, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay9 at the molecular and cellular levels. All of
these biochemical-based HTS are targeted assays that include reaction
components and target molecules that are incubated with synthetic
or natural compounds in order to determine the activity of the compound
(e.g., activator or inhibitor). Test compounds (small molecules or
drugs) usually bind to known molecular targets or unintended off-targets.
Such compounds have often led to unexplained reactions, resulting
in side effects or drug repositioning opportunities. Drug repositioning
is defined as finding new therapeutic activities for already existing
drugs including marketed, discontinued, and even synthetic or natural
product-based therapeutic agents.10,11 Recently,
several studies have identified compounds from a pool of drugs approved
for other applications.12,13 This is a profitable
approach because the new applications of these compounds build on
the available information regarding their pharmacokinetics, safety,
and manufacturing.

Recently, we reported the in vitro and in
vivo anti-inflammatory
ability of 30 unique catechol-functionalized pyrimidine-based small
molecules against phosphodiesterase-4B (PDE4B).14,15 Considering the cost-effectiveness of the drug repositioning approach,
we intended to discover new potential targets of our synthetic catecholpyrimidine-based
small molecule library. In this work, to validate this objective,
an inkjet printing-based HTS platform was designed and applied to
our 30 synthetic small molecule library. To date, inkjet printing
technology has not been applied to screen small molecule libraries
in order to find activities with respect to drug targets in the HT
manner even though a few molecules have been tested to demonstrate
the possibility of screening.16 First,
inkjet bioprinting is very attractive for applications for screening
of small molecule libraries because its ejection volume reaches the
nano-to picoliter range. The use of such an ultrasmall ejection volume
is inevitable due to enormous cost reduction expected for the drug
discovery process as the number of molecules in the small molecule
library increases. In addition, the ejection volume in inkjet bioprinting
is highly reproducible, which is quite advantageous for obtaining
quantitatively accurate drug efficacy data.

Currently, kinase
activity assays depend on the use of expensive
reagents and/or instrumentation. On the other hand, inkjet bioprinting
can provide a straightforward, low-cost alternative to determine kinase
activity through HTS.17,18 Over several decades, inkjet
bioprinting technologies have been increasingly used as a tool for
the synthesis of small molecules,19 thin
film coatings,20 genomics validation,21 and biosensor fabrication.22−27 Moreover, bioprinting has been used for the direct printing of precise
patterns to evaluate the activity of DNA,28 RNA,29 protein,30 enzymes,31−33 and cells34,35 on various substrates.

Herein, for the first time, we report an inkjet bioprinting-based
HTS for screening a library of novel catecholpyrimidine-based small
molecules (30 synthetic compounds) for discovering new hit compounds
that inhibit kinase activity. The bioink composition consisting of
Triton-X and glycerol was optimized to establish the matrix without
any migration, diffusion, and absorption of printed reagents onto
the substrate for the kinase-to-kinase phosphorylation. The phosphorylation
reaction of two different kinase enzymes must be handled extremely
carefully for finding a hit compound on the printing substrate. The
optimized composition of bioink is essential for the successful HTS.
The biomaterials (target enzymes: c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase1
(JNK1) and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) along with
reaction components) and synthetic compounds (test compounds: catecholpyrimidine-based
small molecules) were initially loaded into the printing cartridge
and subsequently printed on the substrate. We show that the catecholpyrimidine-based
small molecules and the enzymes (JNK1 and MAPK) interact synergistically
to inhibit JNK1 activity. Taking the HTS approach as a starting point
to assess hit kinase inhibitor compounds, 30 small molecules were
tested by utilizing the bioprinting-based HTS platform. Our results
demonstrate that the hit compound (compound 22) out of
30 small molecules was highly efficient at inhibiting kinase activity
in the femtomolar range. Thus, the combination of the bioprinting
technique and HTS led to the discovery of catecholpyrimidine small
molecules as potential JNK1 inhibitors and represents a new alternative
for the screening of synthetic and natural product-based small molecular
libraries. These results suggest a bright future for inkjet bioprinting
as a new platform for HTS of compound libraries. It should be noted
that the present inkjet bioprinting system is still in the research
stage and can be further developed in combination with an automated
robotic system. The inkjet printing using cartridges can be adopted
as a dispenser to provide a small ejection volume, ranging from nanoliter
to picoliter. The number of HT printing reaction spots is potentially
unlimited and can be simply adjusted using software as needed in HTS.

Results and Discussion
Small Molecules Library for Screening JNK1 Inhibition
JNK is a serine threonine protein kinase that phosphorylates c-Jun,
a component of the transcription factor activator protein-1. JNK activity
appears to be critical for both the immune response and for programmed
cell death. Hence, therapeutically targeting JNK can provide clinical
benefits in disease conditions such as arthritis, inflammatory disease,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and myocardial infarction.
Recently, we reported on the anti-inflammatory activities of a catechol-functionalized
pyrimidine-based small molecule library against PDE4B. Kwak et al.36 examined the mechanism by which roflumilast
(PDE4B inhibitor) inhibits inflammatory mediators such as nuclear
factor-κB, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and c-Jun NH2-terminal
kinase. Similarly, several other studies have reported the use of
PDE4B inhibitors to suppress the activity of JNK/MAPKs. Considering
these findings, the catecholpyrimidine-based small molecule library
that showed selectivity to PDE4B was tested for multitargeting effect.
The bioprinting-based HTS platform was designed and employed to screen
the library of novel catecholpyrimidine-based small molecules against
kinase.

The bioprinting-based dispersion technique is a promising
approach for pharmaceutical applications. The bioprinting-based HTS
has several advantages such as low cost due to the nano- to picoliter
ejection volume, miniaturized automatic structure, biocompatibility
and reproducibility and the ease of software-based HT pattern design.
Despite these powerful advantages, with the exception of the present
work, screening of library compounds for a particular target has not
been performed through inkjet bioprinting to date.37,38Figure 1 represents
the structure of the pyrimidine-based small molecules. Compounds 22, 26, and 27 were synthesized
according to the previously reported procedure. The structure and
molecular weight of the compounds were analyzed using NMR and ESI-QTOF
mass spectrometry. The detailed synthetic procedures of compounds 22, 26, and 27 are described in
the Supporting Information.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration
of the JNK1-mediated phosphorylation cascade
reaction using the inkjet printing method.

Schematic Representation of JNK1-dependent Phosphorylation Reaction
Figure 1 illustrates
the scheme for performing the inkjet printing-based JNK1-dependent
phosphorylation cascade reaction. To perform the JNK-1-dependent phosphorylation
reaction, all of the reaction components were sequentially printed
on the parchment paper surface and the reaction was carried out. The
Ser/Thr 4 peptide was labeled with two fluorophores (donor-coumarin
and acceptor-fluorescein) for the FRET pair. This labeled peptide
was used to determine the JNK1-dependent phosphorylation cascade reaction
on paper. As shown in Figure 1, reaction components, including the synthesized compounds,
JNK1 + MAPKAPK2 + Ser/Thr 4 peptide mixture, adenosine triphosphate
(ATP), and the development reagent were printed from CMYK cartridges.
The reaction occurred on the parchment paper surface. JNK1 activates
MAPKAPK2, and in the presence of ATP, the activated MAPKAPK2 transfers
a γ-phosphate (γ-PO32–) group
on ATP. γ-PO32– is transferred
to a single serine or threonine residue in the Ser/Thr peptide substrate.
The phosphorylation reaction is inhibited in the presence of the synthesized
compound. After the phosphorylation reaction, a development reagent
was printed to the reaction spot. The development reagent specifically
recognized and cleaved the nonphosphorylated peptide. After cleavage,
the fluorescence emission intensities of the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated
peptides were acquired. Based on the fluorescence emission intensity,
% phosphorylation was calculated and IM50 (inhibitory mole
50) was determined.

Bioink Activity Optimization before the Printing-Based Assay
A FRET peptide (Ser/Thr 4 peptide), tagged with two fluorophores
(coumarin and fluorescein), was used to determine the kinase activity
on the substrate (parchment paper). The bioink composition based on
Triton X-100 and glycerol was optimized for the best printing performance.
In particular, the evaporation rate of the printed bioink on the parchment
paper is highly important for dealing with consecutive enzymatic reactions
such as kinase phosphorylation. The printing condition devoid of evaporation
of printed bioink was optimized using glycerol and was utilized to
print the assay components. To modify the viscosity, surface tension,
and evaporation rate, Triton-X and glycerol were used for the preparation
of bioink. Triton-X is used widely as a mild surfactant because it
does not affect enzyme activity. Glycerol was used to modify the viscosity
and evaporation rate. Nine different components of the 1.33×
assay buffer with W/WO surfactant were prepared, and the JNK1 activity
was investigated. The control group showed that the phosphorylation
efficiency was 36.61%. Bioink solutions of JNK1 (7.5 × 10–7 g/mL) + MAPKAPK2 (5.0 × 10–6 g/mL) + Ser/Thr 4 peptide (4 μM) mixture, ATP (0.1 mM), and
the development reagent in 1.33× assay buffer containing nine
concentrations of the surfactant were prepared. Their activities in
the prepared 1.33× assay buffer were measured. Figure 2 shows the effect of the surfactant
dose on the JNK1 activity. Figure 3 illustrates the % phosphorylation change based on
the increased addition (%) of glycerol. For the 0.1% Triton-X dose,
there was a negligible decrease in the JNK1 activity. In the presence
of the 0.1% Triton-X dose, glycerol was added (1–15%). Because
of the viscosity of glycerol, the viscosity of bioink solution was
also changed and the glycerol content impacted the JNK1 activity.
When 1–4% of glycerol was added to the bioink solution, the
JNK1 activity was not altered clearly. However, further addition of
glycerol decreased the JNK1 activity, and when more than 5% glycerol
was added to the assay buffer, the enzyme activity was decreased vertically
as the amount of added glycerol increased.

printing in the presence of Triton-X and glycerol. Error bars represent
the standard deviation of three independent measurements.

images of compounds 22, 26, and 27, and fluorescence emission images of 0% phosphorylation, 0% inhibition,
and 100% phosphorylation conditions. The printed amount of small molecules
is presented.

The printing ability of bioinks was measured prior
to the printing-based
JNK1 inhibition assay. The printing ability of each bioink composition
was detected using an inkjet printer. Table 1 shows the printing ability of the bioinks.
The printing was carried out in the presence of 0.1% Triton-X in the
bioink. After adding 1–10% of glycerol to the 0.1% Triton-X-containing
bioink, printing was performed well. As shown in Table 1, when 15% glycerol was added
to the assay buffer, the bioink was not printed on the parchment paper
surface because of its high viscosity. After printing, the spreading
patterns of all of the bioink compositions (0–15% glycerol)
were observed. At 0% Triton-X of only buffer solution, the printed
pattern showed evaporation immediately with small spreading. At 0–10%
glycerol with 0.1% Triton-X, there was no spreading or tailing of
the printing pattern on the parchment paper. All of the printed patterns
were printed clearly and remained without moisture absorption of parchment
paper. Furthermore, these phenomena were sustained despite repeated
printing on the parchment paper surface. Based on these results, 0.1%
Triton-X with 2% glycerol was selected as the bioink media for the
inkjet printing-based experiment.

Determination of the JNK1 Inhibition Activity Using Inkjet Printing
The percentage of phosphorylation and inhibitory efficacy of synthesized
compounds were acquired through the inkjet bioprinting HTS. As illustrated
in Figure 3a, inkjet
printing-based JNK1-dependent phosphorylation and JNK1 activity screening
was performed. To investigate hit compounds as JNK1 inhibitors, four
different synthesized small compounds were used. To check the inhibition
activity of small compounds, two groups (control and test) of experiments
were performed. To determine the JNK1-dependent phosphorylation efficacy,
all of the bioinks were printed on parchment paper. As a control,
the printing was carried out with (100% phosphorylation or 0% inhibition
condition) and without ATP (0% phosphorylation or 100% inhibition
condition) conditions, and phosphorylated-Ser/Thr 4 peptide was printed.
The printing pattern was set to be 3 rows by 3 columns for reproducibility,
and the pattern size was set by the spot diameter of 1 mm. After printing
and incubation, the reaction spot was excited at 400 nm. As shown
in Figure 4b, at the
0% inhibition condition, 35.27% of the Ser/Thr 4 peptide was phosphorylated
and the emission ratio was 1.84. This result indicates that JNK1 (and
MAPKAPK2) is active and can phosphorylate 35.27% of the Ser/Thr 4
peptide on the reaction spot, and 64.73% of the Ser/Thr 4 peptide
was cleaved. In the 100% inhibition condition, 0% of the Ser/Thr 4
peptide was phosphorylated and the emission ratio was 3.86. For the
phosphorylated-Ser/Thr 4 peptide, 100% of the peptide was phosphorylated
and the emission ratio was 0.41%. These observed differences in the
% phosphorylation indicate that the phosphorylation cascade reaction
was successfully carried out on the parchment paper surface.

As illustrated in Figure 3a, the inkjet printing drug screening assay
was performed
in order to estimate the JNK1 inhibition ability of 30 small compounds.
The compound cartridge (black color cartridge) was changed for the
printing of each synthesized compound. After printing a compound,
the black cartridge was changed to another black cartridge for the
printing of another compound. All black cartridges were cleaned with
ethanol before use. The printer head and dispensing part of the black
cartridge were cleaned by printing of ethanol in the cartridge. Then,
the black cartridge was filled with another synthesized compound along
with the identical bioink. The cleaning process of the cartridge was
executed automatically using a printer management software. The cleaned
cartridge was reused after rapid cleaning. The bioink-synthesized
compound → JNK1 + MAPKAPK2 + Ser/Thr 4 peptide mixture →
ATP were sequentially printed on parchment paper at each reaction
point of 8 rows by 20 columns. Table 2 shows the CMYK color values, density, and ejected
volume per printing of each reagent, and the ejected amount of each
reagent was calculated from these values. The present results verify
that inkjet bioprinting HTS is a powerful screening tool of library
compounds. Particularly, as shown in Table 2, the present inkjet bioprinting system provided
the ejection volume to reach to ∼5 nL. After printing, 1.7
× 10–11 g of JNK1, 1.16 × 10–10 g of MAPKAPK2, 4.63 × 10–15 mol of Ser/Thr
4 peptide, and 1.04 × 10–13 mol of ATP were
printed on each reaction spot.

when the CMYK color codes were set in the range of 5–50. Then,
the reagents printed on the parchment paper were incubated at room
temperature for 1 h. Additionally, the development reagent printed
on each reaction spot was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After
the printing-based drug screening reaction, the fluorescence emission
from each reaction spot was acquired using a confocal microscope.
In the presence of small molecules, a gradationally decreased emission
signal of fluorescein (525 nm) and an increased emission signal of
coumarin (445 nm) were recorded simultaneously.

Figure 4 shows the
decreased emission signal of fluorescein and an increased emission
signal of coumarin. In the presence of compounds 22 (Figure 4a), 26 (Figure 4b), and 27 (Figure 4c), an increase in the coumarin emission intensity and a decrease
in the fluorescein emission intensity were generated at each reaction
spot. This result indicates that compounds 22, 26, and 27 inhibited JNK1, and thus, MAPKAPK2
(downstream cascade enzyme of JNK1) was not activated. Therefore,
the amount of cascade reaction-mediated phosphorylation of the Ser/Thr
4 peptide was decreased. Figure 5 shows the decreases in the % phosphorylation by compound 22 (Figure 5a), compound 26 (Figure 5b), and compound 27 (Figure 5b) and the molecular structures
of these small molecules. As shown in Table 3, the acquired IM50 of each compound
was 1.55 × 10–15 mol (compound 22), 1.66 × 10–13 mol (compound 26), and 1.09 × 10–13 mol (compound 27). These results show that compound 22 has the lowest
inhibitory activity of the three synthesized compounds. On the other
hand, most of the small molecules showed IM50 values in
the nanomolar range (Table S1). Although
thirty small molecules were screened to find hit compounds through
the present inkjet bioprinting system, more small molecules can be
screened up to the number which is required in HTS in the present
inkjet bioprinting system. This can be easily adjusted by designing
printing spots of row-by-column using the software.

Generally, physicochemical properties of compounds
can be varied
according to their different chemical structures and functional groups.
Because of the large compound number in libraries, it is unavoidable
to face a variety of compounds having different physicochemical properties
in a small molecule library. As the compound number of the library
increases, the variety inherent to the compounds of the library is
greatly developed. When the inkjet printing is applied to HTS of a
small molecule library, conformance of a particular bioink has to
be considered for a large number of library compounds with different
physicochemical properties. It is interesting to prove whether a particular
bioink can cover a large number of library compounds having different
chemical structures and functional groups without the change of its
composition for inkjet printing. In this work, the 30 small-molecules
library is derivatives based on the catecholopyrimidine or morpholinopyrimidine
core structure mainly. These chemical structures have different physicochemical
properties such as solubility, lipophilicity, molecular weight, and
so forth. The inkjet printing of all compounds was tested with a bioink
in spite of the difference in core molecular structures and functional
groups. Surprisingly, the inkjet printing of 30 synthetic molecules
could be successfully performed using a bioink consisting of 0.1%
Triton-X and 2% glycerol without the change of its composition. This
is the first attempt and important demonstration to verify how a small
molecule library can properly act on a bioink for inkjet HTS to identify
a hit compound without the change of its composition.

Conclusions
In summary, a user-friendly bioprinting-based
HTS was developed
to screen a library of novel catecholpyrimidine-based small molecules,
and hit compounds were found to target JNK1. The developed platform
showed that a FRET peptide substrate was successfully utilized to
determine the phosphorylation percentage, which in turn revealed the
inhibitory activity of the synthetic molecules against JNK1. Collectively,
the present result demonstrated that the hit compound (compound 22) identified out of 30 small molecules was highly efficient
at inhibiting JNK1 activity in the femtomolar range, which was significantly
more effective than the reported JNK inhibitors. Herein, bioprinting
HTS led to the successful discovery of catecholpyrimidine small molecules
as potential JNK1 inhibitors. Thus, the proposed bioprinting-based
HTS represents a new option for screening synthetic and natural product-based
small molecular libraries.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Materials
All of the assay components
including JNK1, inactive MAPKAPK2, ATP (10 mM), Ser/Thr 4 peptide
(1 mM), Ser/Thr 4 phosphopeptide (1 mM), phosphorylated-Ser/Thr 4
phosphopeptide (1 mM), and the developing reagent were purchased from
Invitrogen (California, USA). Glycerol and Triton-X were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (MO, USA). All of the chemicals and materials were
used without further purification.

Synthesis of Small Molecules
The small molecules were
synthesized according to a previously reported procedure as explained
in detail in the Supporting Information.

Bioink Preparation
All of the reagents used in the
experiment were freshly prepared prior to the experiment. The 5×
assay buffer (250 mM of pH 7.5 N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid buffer, 50 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA, 0.05% BRIG-35) was freshly prepared. JNK1 (7.5 ×
10–7 g/mL), inactive MAPKAPK2 (5.0 × 10–6 g/mL), ATP (10 mM), Ser/Thr 4 peptide (4 μM),
and Ser/Thr 4 phosphopeptide (4 μM) were prepared using the
1.33× assay buffer. The development solution was prepared using
the 1× development buffer. The synthesized small molecule solutions
were prepared using a mixture of water and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

Bioink Activity Optimization before the Printing-Based Assay
All reagents used in the experiment were freshly prepared and the
amount of DMSO was kept below 2% in order not to affect the activities
of the enzymes. All of the solutions were prepared just before the
experiment and kept on ice at 0 °C, and the solutions remaining
after the experiment were discarded without being reused. The synthesized
compounds dissolved in DMSO could be stored at 4 °C for 3 weeks
and used for printing. The powders of synthesized compounds were found
to be stable up to 2 years at 4 °C. In this work, it was found
that at least 1.5 mL solution composed of reagents along with the
bioink media was needed in the cartridge for the successful inkjet
printing. To modify the viscosity and evaporation velocity, Triton-X
and glycerol were used for the bioink preparation. All bioinks were
prepared in a 1.33× assay buffer containing 0.1% Triton-X and
1–15% glycerol. Prior to the printing, the phosphorylation
activities and printing abilities were measured. JNK1 activity was
measured in a 384-well plate. Initially, JNK1 + MAPKAPK2 + Ser/Thr
4 peptide mixtures (5 μL) containing different % of glycerol
were transferred to a 384-well plate. ATP (2.5 μL) was added
to each well, and the assay plate was placed on a shaker for 30 s
to mix the reagents well. The plate was incubated at room temperature
(25 °C) for 1.5 h for the cascade phosphorylation. During incubation,
the well plate was covered with a transparent sheet to prevent evaporation
and contamination of the solution. After incubation, a development
solution (5 μL) was added to each well and the assay plate was
placed on a shaker for 30 s to mix the reagents. The plate was incubated
at room temperature (25 °C) for 1 h for enzymatic cleavage. Then,
the well plate was covered with a transparent sheet. Finally, the
stop solution (5 μL) was added, and after shaking for 30 s,
the fluorescence intensities of coumarin (Ex/Em = 400/445 nm) and
fluorescein (Ex/Em = 400/525 nm) were measured using a multiplate
reader. Prior to the measurement, the total reaction volume was set
to 20 μL after the addition of 1.33× assay buffer (2.5
μL). For the control, with and without ATP conditions experiments
were performed, and the emission fluorescence intensity from the phosphorylated-Ser/Thr
4 peptide was acquired. The following two equations were used to calculate
the percentage of phosphorylation for the assessment of the inhibition
activity of the synthesized compounds.    

Bioink Printing Ability before the Printing-Based Assay
A set of four cartridges used for the printer (HP Officejet Pro 8100)
was modified. The inks present inside the cartridges were removed,
and the cartridges were washed 10 times with deionized water and 100%
ethanol. To minimize the damage of the cartridge rubber pack during
the clearing, the backside of the cartridge was cut and a hole was
drilled and the inside was emptied. After the removal of their contents,
the four cartridges were dried at room temperature (25 °C) overnight.
These modified cartridges were used for the experiment.

To determine
whether printing is possible based on the composition of all of the
bioinks, 1.33× assay buffers containing 0.1% Triton-X and 1–15%
of glycerol were prepared. The CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black)
cartridges were filled with each bioink, and bioinks were printed
onto the parchment paper surface. The CMYK color values that can verify
the ejected volume from the printer head were adjusted using a graphic
program (Adobe Photoshop CC), and the printing pattern was set using
Microsoft Power Point software. The CMYK color codes were converted
to RGB color codes, and the color of the printing pattern was set.
The pattern was designed using the Microsoft PowerPoint software and
each bioink was dispensed onto the printing pattern. All of the printing
patterns were designed and were set to 8 rows by 20 columns. The individual
printing spots of 8 row by 20 columns correspond to each well in the
commercially available well-plate. The dimensions of the row-by-column
printing spot can be freely adjusted using the software as required
in HTS, for example, 1536 spots and more can be made. All of the color
values were set as 100, and the shape of the printing pattern for
the reaction was set as a spot with a diameter of 1 mm. All of the
bioinks were printed on the each reaction spot, and their printing
abilities were identified. The enzymatic stability was found to be
stable up to 4 h after the preparation of enzymatic assay solution.
Based on this result, the JNK1 inhibition assay was performed.

Determination of JNK1 Inhibition Activity Using Inkjet Printing
To investigate the JNK1-dependent phosphorylation and inhibition
activity on parchment paper, all bioinks were printed on parchment
paper. First, with and without ATP, 0% inhibition (100% phosphorylation)
and 100% inhibition (0% phosphorylation) conditions were measured
for the control. The printing patterns were designed as 3 rows by
3 columns for the control assay, 1 mm diameter spot, and 1 mm gap
per each spot to spot. To evaluate the inhibitory activity of the
synthesized compounds (as JNK1 inhibitors) using inkjet printing,
the CMYK color codes settings were fixed at 100, 50, 100, and 100,
respectively, in order to print constant amounts of JNK1 + MAPKAPK2
+ Ser/Thr 4 phosphopeptide, ATP, phosphorylated-Ser/Thr 4 peptide,
development reagent, and 1.33× assay buffer, respectively. The
printing patterns were designed as 8 rows by 20 columns with a spot
diameter of 1 mm and a gap of 1 mm for each spot. For the synthesized
compounds, the color code settings were varied from 5 to 50 in order
to vary the amount of the synthesized compounds. Herein, for this
experiment, two printing heads and 2 sets of CMYK cartridges were
prepared.

For the control assay, the inhibition activity of
100% was evaluated by printing the mixture of JNK1 + MAPKAPK2 + Ser/Thr
4 peptide without ATP (Figure 3b—first column), whereas the inhibition activity of
0% was assessed with printing the mixture of JNK1 + MAPKAPK2 + Ser/Thr
4 peptide along with ATP (Figure 3b—second column). The phosphorylation of 100%
was evaluated by printing the phosphorylated-Ser/Thr 4 peptide (Figure 3b—third column).

After the control assay, inkjet printing-based phosphorylation
cascade reactions were performed to determine the JNK1 inhibition
activity of the synthesized small compounds. For this assay, the bioink-synthesized
compound → JNK1 + MAPKAPK2 + Ser/Thr 4 peptide mixture →
ATP was sequentially printed on parchment paper at each reaction spot.
The assay component-printed papers were incubated for 1 h at room
temperature (25 °C). The 1.33× assay buffer was printed
once in 20 min to stimulate the phosphorylation cascade reaction on
the parchment paper. After incubation, the developing solution was
printed on the reaction spot, and the printed papers were incubated
for 1 h at room temperature (25 °C). After incubation, fluorescence
images [coumarin (Ex/Em = 400 nm/445 nm) and fluorescein (Ex/Em = 400 nm/525 nm)] were
acquired using a confocal microscope (Leica, TCS SP8). The acquired
fluorescence images were analyzed using ImageJ software. The amounts
of the assay components printed on each spot were evaluated based
on the volume printed per spot and their respective solution densities,
as suggested by Song et al.39
