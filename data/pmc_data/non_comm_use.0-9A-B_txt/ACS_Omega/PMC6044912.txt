Partition constants (KD°), molecular dynamics (T1, T2, and DOSY measurements), thermal stability, and toxicity
of dicationic ionic liquids (ILs) were determined. The dicationic
ILs derived from 1,n-bis(3-methylimidazolim-1-yl)octane,
[BisOct(MIM)2][2X] (in which X = Cl, Br, NO3, SCN, BF4, and NTf2), were evaluated to verify
the influence of anion structure on the IL properties. A monocationic
IL [Oct(MIM)][Br] was also monitored for comparison. In general, the
solubility of the ILs followed the anion free energy of hydration
(ΔG°hyd). The thermokinetic
and thermodynamic functions of activation of the ILs were determined
via thermogravimetric data, and it was observed that polyatomic anions
influence the decomposition mechanism of these IL structures. Furthermore,
[Oct(MIM)][Br] had a decomposition rate greater than that of the dicationic
analogue, and the thermodynamic parameters of activation data corroborate
these results. Finally, the dicationic ILs did not indicate toxic
effects (LD50 > 40 mM).

1 Introduction
Ionic
liquids (ILs) have been an option for a wide range of applications.
This is due to their unusual and adjustable properties, which manifest
in accordance with changes in their structures. Low vapor pressure
and chemical and thermal stability make them very good solvents for
many chemical reactions and separations.1−11 Furthermore, a wide electrochemical window and the high conductivity
of ILs enable their use as electrolytes in solar cells and batteries.12

Imidazolium-based ILs are the most investigated
IL class. Dicationic
ILs have been used as solvents,13 as surfactants,14,15 lubricants,16 and for nanoparticle coatings.16 However, obtaining ILs that have enhanced physicochemical
properties as well as low toxicity is very challenging. The lack of
information regarding IL properties is a major barrier to the utilization
of these compounds.

The solubility and the diffusion rate parameters
for ILs can limit
the reaction conversions and charge transport, thus making these properties
particularly interesting for synthetic and electrochemical applications.
The higher thermal stability provides several engineering advantages,
e.g., thermal energy storage and heat-transfer fluids.17 Finally, toxicity is a key parameter to be determined
due to environmental contamination, or when ILs are designed for biomedical
applications.18−20

Changing the structure of the cations and anions
leads to ILs with
physical, chemical, and biological properties designed for specific
purposes.21 It is known that the anions
of ILs have some influence on the overall toxicity of these structures.
In general, the higher the hydrophobicity of anions, the more toxic
and less biodegradable they are.18 The
partition constant (KD°) is related to the likelihood of
a compound accumulating in an organism because the water-saturated
1-octanol is a model of the cell in living organisms.22 This is important for determining the solubility in water
and the possible effect of ILs on aquatic environments.

To contribute
to the research on dicationic imidazolium-based ILs,
the goal of this investigation was to obtain a greater understanding
of the influence that anions have on the ILs’ physicochemical
properties. Partition constant, molecular dynamics (self-diffusion
coefficient and relaxation times), toxicity, and thermal stability
were evaluated. Dicationic ILs with different anions were chosen to
evaluate different physicochemical and biological properties as a
function of the anions’ characteristics. A monocationic IL
was used to compare the data. The ILs selected are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Structure of the cations
and anions of the ILs used.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Determination
of the Partition Constants of
the ILs
The solubility properties of the dicationic ILs are
predicted from the determination of the partition constant (KD°), which is calculated via eq 1(23) and enables the calculation
of the amount of IL remaining in water in a 1-octanol/water system. 1  In eq 1, the partition constant (KD°) is the ratio
between the
concentration of IL at equilibrium in both phases, i.e., in 1-octanol
([IL]octanol) and in water ([IL]water). The KD° value is essential for understanding the tendency of an IL to bioaccumulate
by passing through biological membranes. This is possible because
the dielectric properties of 1-octanol are similar to a lipid phase.24

For this study, a calibration curve of
absorbance as a function of the concentration of the solution is constructed
for each IL in water. The absorbance measurements are obtained using
spectroscopy of molecular absorption in the UV–vis region.
The graph for absorbance versus wavelength (λ) and the calibration
curves of [BisOct(MIM)2][2X] (in which X = Br, Cl, NO3, SCN, and BF4) and [Oct(MIM)][Br] are shown in
the Supporting Information (SI).

In accordance with the methodology, after 24 h, the water content
is separated from 1-octanol and the absorbance is measured. The concentration
of IL remaining in the water is determined from the equation of the
predetermined calibration curve. The [IL]octanol concentration
was calculated from the equation 100 – [IL]water (in which 100 is the initial IL concentration, in mM), and then
the KD° values are determined (Figure 2a). From the KD° data, a solubility
order for the dicationic ILs in water, in accordance with the anions,
was established: [BF4]− < [SCN]− < [NO3]− < [Br]− < [Cl]−. These results are related
to the anion free energy of hydration (ΔG°hyd) taken from Marcus,25 see Figure 2b.

Figure 2 (a) Comparison of KD° values for the ILs and (b) KD° as a function of ΔG°hyd for
the anions of the dicationic ILs.

The progression of ΔG°hyd to less negative values makes the anions increasingly hydrophobic.
This parameter may be related to the solubility of ILs that have different
anions in their structures. Figure 2b shows that the KD° values of dicationic ILs
tend to increase with an increase in ΔG°hyd (less negative values). Therefore, more positive the ΔG°hyd, the smaller the hydration degree
of the ILs and the higher the KD°. Thus, it can be seen that
the dicationic IL [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] is more soluble in
water than its monocationic analogue [Oct(MIM)][Br]. The greater solubility
in water shown by [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] may be related to
the fact that it has one more cationic head than [Oct(MIM)][Br], which
enables better interaction of the structure with the aqueous phase. KD° values for several monocationic ILs with different anions and alkyl
chain lengths have already been established in the literature.22,23,26 To the best of our knowledge, KD° values have not yet been measured for dicationic ILs. For monocationic
ILs with the [NTf2]− anion, the KD° value increases as the alkyl chain length on the cation increases.22 This behavior is attributed to the van der Waals
interactions between the alkyl chain of the IL and the 1-octanol molecules.
Furthermore, it has been observed that KD° is dependent
on the IL concentration; in general, for the same IL cation [But(MIM)]+, the KD° values follow the trend of anion hydrophilicity.22 The same is observed for the dicationic ILs
evaluated in this study. The KD° values for the monocationic
IL analogues of the dicationic ILs addressed in this study (in which
X = Cl, NO3, SCN, and BF4) are not found in
the literature; for this reason, it is not possible to establish a
comparison. Due to the very low solubility of [BisOct(MIM)2][2Ntf2] in water, KD° of this IL cannot be evaluated.
For the same reason, the molecular dynamics and toxicity data of this
IL are also not determined.

2.2 Self-Diffusion Coefficient
and Relaxation
Times of ILs
The self-diffusion coefficients (D) are determined via the DOSY experiments. The T1 and T2 measurements are
acquired to understand the relaxation process as a function of the
self-diffusion of the IL structures in water. The signals monitored
are CH3 and CH2 directly bound to the imidazolium
ring of the ILs. The results are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 (a) Self-diffusion coefficient (D), (b) longitudinal
relaxation time (T1), and (c) transverse
relaxation time (T2) for [BisOct(MIM)2][2X], in which X = Cl (black), Br (red), NO3 (blue),
SCN (cyan), or BF4 (magenta), in D2O (50 mM)
at 25 °C.

The D, T1, and T2 values do not indicate a linear relationship
with ΔG°hyd, which is an estimation
of the hydrophobicity of the structures of the ILs. Figure 3a shows that the D values of the ILs do not indicate significant changes in accordance
with the anion used in the structure, the values were between 3.24
× 10–12 and 3.72 × 10–12 m2 s–1. Furthermore, considerable changes
are not observed in the D values in accordance with
the 1H nuclei evaluated (1H from CH2 or CH3 dication groups). In general, the D values for the cation and anion of a given IL are similar, and this
may be an indication of the presence of a cooperative transport phenomenon
in which the cation and anion diffuse as an ion pair.27,28 In this study, the IL anions do not have hydrogens in the structure;
therefore, only cations signals are evaluated.

The T1 values of the dicationic ILs
are considerably lower for CH2 of the spacer chain in comparison
with the terminal CH3 group, which is expected because
the internal CH2 can relax more effectively because of
the dipolar relaxation mechanism,29 see Figure 3b. However, pronounced
differences are not observed in relation to the anion type for the
same group evaluated (CH2 or CH3). Figure 3c shows the transverse
relaxation time (T2) for the dicationic
ILs. The T2 values observed for CH2 are lower than those for CH3, which is consistent
with the explanation suggested for T1 behavior.
Additionally, as expected, the T2 values
are always lower than the T1 values.29

The lack of correlation in the data in
relation to the anion hydrophobicity
is expected. The anions have a secondary role in these experiments
because the intermolecular dipole–dipole interactions make
a smaller contribution to the relaxation process30 than the intramolecular dipole–dipole interactions
that occur in the dications. Furthermore, as the IL diffused as an
ion pair, the size of the dication in the ILs evaluated could explain
the similar D observed because D is dependent on the hydrodynamic radius of the diffusing species
in the solution, and the anions do not have major size differences
between each other.21,28 In a recent study published by
our research group, it was observed that the anions (Br, NO3, SCN, and BF4) of [BisOct(MIM)2][2X] do not
influence the hydrodynamic radius of the aggregates in a solution
(determined by dynamic light scattering) at different concentrations
(50, 300, and 500 mM).31

Even though
we have observed that ILs with more hydrophobic anions
(e.g., BF4–) tend to form greater and
more compact aggregates because BF4– anions
interact more effectively with IL cation heads in the solution,32 this was not relevant for the D, T1, and T2 values of [BisOct(MIM)2][2BF4] in relation
to other species. Furthermore, the larger the aggregate, the lower
the D value because bigger structures tend to diffuse
more slowly than the smaller ones.

The T1, T2, and D values
of [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br]
are compared with those of the monocationic analogue [Oct(MIM)][Br],
see Table S3 in the SI. The D value of [Oct(MIM)][Br] is slightly higher (0.5 × 10–12 m2 s–1) than that of [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br]. The T1 and T2 values of [Oct(MIM)][Br] are nearly double those of
[BisOct(MIM)2][2Br]. This indicates that the presence of
an additional cationic head in [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] leads
to a slower diffusion of the species in water while stimulating a
faster relaxation process for dicationic IL than for monocationic
analogues.

2.3 Thermal Stability Properties
of the ILs
Decomposition kinetics studies are done to determine
the influence
that the structural parameters of anions have on the thermal degradation
process of ILs, and to elucidate which ILs can be used in applications
involving high temperatures. The decomposition profile of [BisOct(MIM)2][Br] at the heating rates of 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 °C min–1 is shown in Figure 4. The decomposition profiles of other ILs are shown
in the SI. The thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) curve has only one endothermic peak, without any apparent loss
of mass up to 520 K (there was only one mass loss stage).

Figure 4 Overlap of
TGA thermograms for [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] at
different heating rates.

From the TGA data, two different methodologies are used to
analyze
the decomposition kinetics of the ILs: the Ozawa–Wall–Flynn
(O–W–F) and Friedman methodologies.33 Both methods enable the determination of kinetic parameters
from the nonisothermal thermogravimetric data at different heating
rates. The weight loss variation observed in the TGA analysis is called
the mass fraction of conversion (α), which is calculated via eq 2.34 2  In which m0 is
the initial mass, mf is the final mass,
and mt is the mass at time t. The kinetics results from the O–W–F method are obtained
via eq 3. A graph showing
ln(β) versus 1/T for each value of α
is constructed, see Figure 5a.34 3  In eq 3, β is
the heating rate, A is the collision
factor representing the total number of collisions between molecules, Ea is the activation energy necessary to break
one mole of bonds between the atoms of the molecules, T is the absolute temperature, and R is the constant
of ideal gases. The Friedman method enables determination of the kinetic
parameters by linear fitting of the ln(β dα/dt) curve as a function of 1/T in nonisothermal
experiments (eq 4), see Figure 5b.34 The equation f(α) = (1 –
α) is considered for both methods in this study. 4  The angular coefficient of the linear
fragments
in each α of the two different methods (Figure 5) gives the energy activation (Ea) value of the decomposition process, see Figure 6. From the Ea values, the collision factor (A) can
be estimated by applying the Arrhenius equation35 (Figure 6).

Figure 5 Curves that show (a) ln β vs 1/T and
(b) ln β (dα/dT) vs 1/T for [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br].

Figure 6 Curves that show Ea vs α vs ln A for [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] obtained by the application
of the (a) O–F–W and (b) Friedman methods to the TGA
experimental data.

The Ea and ln A of [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] remain constant for all of the
α evaluated. This indicates that as a function of temperature,
the decomposition reaction of this IL occurs in a single step with
an average activation energy of 145.18 kJ mol–1,
which is determined via the Ea obtained
from the O–F–W method (Figure 6a). The same tendency is observed via the
Friedman method (Figure 6b).

For the [BisOct(MIM)2][2X] ILs (in which X =
NTf2, BF4, and NO3), the Ea and ln A values increase
with
the increase in α from 0.1 to 0.9. In these cases, side reactions
occur during the decomposition process (multiple steps). These reactions
involve competitive reaction pathways with different reaction rates,
which are dependent on the temperature and heating rates. The IL [BisOct(MIM)2][2SCN] has a distinct behavior in which the Ea and ln A decrease as α
increases, see Section 3 in the SI.

In the IL based on the imidazolium ring, it is proposed that the
major component of thermal degradation is the neutralization of the
imidazolium ring through a second-order nucleophilic substitution
(SN2) that occurs with the loss of the IL’s alkyl
chain.17 The decomposition of [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] in a single step could be related to this SN2 dealkylation reaction in the dication of the IL. On the other hand,
in the [BisOct(MIM)2][2X] ILs (in which X = NTf2, BF4, NO3, and SCN), multiple reactions can
occur simultaneously, which leads to modifications in the Ea and ln A as the α
changes. This behavior may be related to the additional bond breaks
in the anions of these ILs. For the IL [Bu(MIM)][NTf2],
the NTf2 decomposition has already been predicted via the
density functional theory (DFT) calculations.36 In this case, the IL decomposition occurs via an exothermic reaction
with the release of sulfur dioxide (SO2). ILs containing
non-nucleophilic anions (e.g., the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide
anion) cannot decompose via dealkylation or proton transfer, the latter
is less likely due to the high energy barrier for the decomposition
calculated by DFT.36

The Ea values show the energy difference
between the reactants and the transition state. The greater the Ea values, the more energy is required for the
reactants to reach the transition state of the decomposition reaction.
The difference in the profile of Ea as
a function of α observed for this IL series shows that the anions
of the IL structures promote pronounced changes in the thermal degradation
of dicationic ILs (Figure 7a). The profile of the degradation process rate’s constant
(k) for each IL versus α indicates some differences
as α increases (Figure 7b). Initially (α < 0.5), the rate constant’s
decomposition behavior can be attributed to the major thermal degradation
component of these ILs, neutralization of the imidazolium ring through
an SN2 reaction between the anion and carbon directly bound
to the imidazolium ring, being the same for [BisOct(MIM)2][2X] (in which X = Br, BF4, NO3, and SCN).
When α is greater than 0.5, the differences in the degradation
process’s profile can be related to the energy involved in
the groups moving away from the structures of the anions. As previously
mentioned, the thermal degradation of [BisOct(MIM)2][2NTf2] is different because the degradation mechanism of this IL
initially occurs via the SO2 release.

and (b) k vs α for [BisOct(MIM)2][2X], in which X = (■) Br, (●) NO3, (▲)
SCN, (▼) BF4, and (◀) NTf2, ascertained
via the O–F–W method.

The kinetic parameters (Ea, A, and k) obtained are used to evaluate
the thermodynamic parameters of activation for the ILs. The thermodynamic
parameters for the thermal decomposition of the ILs are calculated
at 25 °C, using Ea and ln A values in α of 0.1 and 0.5. The α values of
0.1 and 0.5 correspond to 10 and 50% of activity loss, respectively.
Determination of the kinetic parameters for 10% of activity loss is
important for the pharmaceutical industry because it is generally
associated with the shelf life of the compounds, whereas 50% of the
activity loss is associated with the half-life of the compounds. The
data for the thermodynamic parameters of activation, including entropy
(ΔS‡), enthalpy (ΔH‡), and Gibbs free energy (ΔG‡) of activation, are shown in Table 1. They were calculated
using the following equations.37 5   6   7  In eqs 5, 6, and 7, υ
= kBT/h (in which kB is the Boltzmann constant
and h is the Plank constant), T is
the temperature in K, and R is the gas constant in
kJ mol–1.

The ΔG‡ is
influenced
by the ΔH‡ and ΔS‡ of the activated complex formation.
The value of the activation enthalpy shows energy differences between
the activated complex and the initial IL structure. As expected, the
ΔG‡ and ΔH‡ values are positive due to the decomposition
of ILs being an endergonic and endothermic process, respectively.
These parameters show that the decomposition reactions of the ILs
are nonspontaneous and dependent on heating. The larger and more positive
the ΔH‡ values, the more
energy is necessary to break the covalent bonds of the ILs. The dicationic
IL with NO3 anion is the most thermally stable structure,
followed by BF4, Br, SCN, and NTf2 for all of
the α evaluated. In general, the ΔH‡ values follow the same trend as the ΔG‡ data, and they are dependent on several
exo- and endothermic decomposition reactions. The relatively low stability
of [BisOct(MIM)2][2NTf2] can be attributed to
(i) the considerable volatility of imidazolium-based ILs possessing
NTf2 counter ions38,39 and (ii) the exothermic
release of SO2 molecules in the decomposition of the anions.17,36 The decomposition kinetics of [Oct(MIM)][Br] elucidated through
the isothermal TG data is established by Arellano et al.35 In this work, the Ea and ln A values found for the 533–573
K temperature range are 219.89 kJ mol–1 and 48.19
min–1, respectively. However, the thermodynamic
parameters of activation (ΔG‡, ΔH‡, and ΔS‡) of the process are not determined.
In this present study, in the same temperature range and with α
= 0.5, the Ea and ln A values for [Oct(MIM)][2Br] obtained via the nonisothermal O–F–W
method were 230.27 kJ mol–1 and 39.38 min–1, respectively. Considering that different methods are used in this
investigation compared to the work of Arellano et al.,35 the values show a good agreement.

The
low activation entropy values indicate that the compounds have
a low reactivity, and that the time required to attain the activated
complex is long.37 Thus, the lower ΔS‡ values for these ILs confirm that the
decomposition process’s activated complex has a higher degree
of arrangement. Although the ΔS‡ values of the reactions are negative, due to the activation complex
being more organized in relation to the reactants, the [BisOct(MIM)2][2NO3] (α = 0.1 and 0.5) and [Oct(MIM)][Br]
(α = 0.5) have small positive entropy values. These results
can be attributed to the large Ea and
ln A values obtained via the experimental
data. The decomposition process for these structures is dependent
on a complex set of reactions occurring at the same time. Thus, the
positive ΔS‡ values observed
for these structures may be the result of a sum of separated reaction
entropies. The mechanism for thermal IL degradation is complex because
multiple parameters must be considered. The decomposition mechanisms
are subject to multiple simultaneous reactions, autocatalytic effects,
and competing reaction pathways with different reaction rates dependent
on temperature and the heating rate.17,38

Figure 8a,b shows
ln k versus 1/T for IL decomposition
in α = 0.1 and α = 0.5, respectively. As observed, the
first-order reaction kinetics for dicationic IL degradation follows
the Arrhenius rate law. The straight lines show the same trend for
both 10 and 50% activity loss. Nevertheless, for 50% weight loss,
the straight lines of [BisOct(MIM)2][2NO3] and
[BisOct(MIM)2][2BF4] move closer together. On
the other hand, the overlapped straight lines of the dicationic ILs
with Br– and SCN– anions for 10%
activity loss separate slightly for 50% activity loss.

2.4 Toxicity
of ILs
The relationship
between the chemical structure and cellular toxicity of monocationic
imidazolium-based ILs is well established.40 Results show that the cytotoxicity of these ILs is governed by the
alkyl chain length, in which the higher toxicity exerted by more hydrophobic
ILs (with longer alkyl chains) is associated with an increase in membrane
permeability and a change in the physical properties of the lipid
bilayer.41 The anion also has an important
effect on the cytotoxicity of monocationic ILs. The structures with
more hydrophobic anions have a higher toxicity than those prepared
with more hydrophilic anions.40 This feature
is related to the stronger interactions with cell membranes and hydrophobic
protein domains, which could potentially disrupt essential physiological
functions.42

On the other hand, the
cellular toxicity of dicationic imidazolium-based ILs is poorly understood.
Steudte et al.43 performed an initial evaluation
of the hazard potential of cations in 10 dicationic ILs by measuring
toxicity at different levels of biological complexity. The results
showed that the toxicity of standard dialkylimidazolium ILs is, in
many cases, lower than that for monocationic ILs. The authors found
that the short terminal side chains and head groups connected via
short alkyl chains are like structural elements, which reduce the
toxicity.

Gindri et al.44 investigated
the anion
effect on the toxicity of dicationic imidazolium-based ILs in MC3T3-E1
preosteoblast cells. The authors reported that the dicationic IL toxicity
is reduced compared to that for monocationic IL, and they attributed
this to the additional cationic head in the dicationic ILs. In the
series evaluated, [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] is considered to
be the IL with the lowest toxicity.

Besides the cellular toxicity
of ILs, the biodegradability of ILs
has become important due to environmental impacts.40,45,46 In terms of their ecological and biological
activity, the impact of IL-based processes on the environment is not
well established, which could be a limitation to the practical use
of the procedures involving ILs.

Caenorhabditis
elegans is a free-living
soil nematode that is also found in aquatic habitats, thus making
it suitable for chemical exposures in aqueous media.47 It is considered to be a model organism for toxicological
studies due to its well-characterized genome, similarity to human
biology, ease of maintenance, and short and prolific life cycle.48 Thus, it is important to consider the survival
of these nematode species as an indicator of the environmental impact
and ecological activity of ILs, especially in the initial planning
and optimization of IL-based process. There are no studies that report
the toxicological effects that dicationic ILs have on nematode species.
A study with monocationic imidazolium-based IL show that the aforementioned
IL has dose-dependent toxic effects on the survival of C. elegans.49 In the same
study, a median lethal concentration (LC50) of 4.71 mM
was measured for [Oct(MIM)][Br] after 24 h exposure.

Here, we
perform an initial investigation of the toxicological
effects that the dicationic [BisOct(MIM)2][2X] ILs (in
which X = Cl, Br, NO3, SCN, and BF4) have on
the survival of C. elegans. In an initial
scanning, the worms in the larval stage (first stage is more sensible)
were exposed to different IL concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 1.0, and 10
mM) for 1 h. From these data, it is observed that the survival rate
of the worms remained above 90%, indicating that these dicationic
ILs do not have toxic effects at all of the concentrations evaluated
(Figure 9). Furthermore,
the toxic anion effect on the survival of C. elegans cannot be evaluated because in all of the ILs tested the survival
rate was above 90%. The average lethal dose (LD50) for
acute exposure (1 h) of C. elegans to
the IL series tested was about >40 mM, which indicates low toxic
effects.
Consequently, it can be deduced that this series is suitable for applications
involving animal or human exposure (e.g., lubricants). These previous
results will provide the foundation for future more profound investigations
to understand the environmental and human health implications of these
dicationic ILs.

3 Conclusions
The results show a series of parameters related to dynamics, solubility,
toxicity, and thermal stability, in accordance with the properties
of the ILs. Establishing all of these properties enables the determination
of important applications for these IL structures. The degree of solubility,
self-diffusion, and relaxation times, in accordance with the anion
structure, can determine which ILs act most effectively in chemical
reactions, microextractions, and as electrolytes in fuel cells. The
following partition constant order was found for the [BisOct(MIM)2]2+ with different anions: [BF4]− < [SCN]− < [NO3]− < [Br]− < [Cl]−. Furthermore, the nontoxic feature indicates that dicationic ILs
can be used for biological and biomedical purposes as lubricants,
in controlled drug delivery, and for bioimaging and cell labeling.

The parameters obtained via the O–F–W and Friedman
methods furnished relevant information about the degradation of the
ILs. The variation in Ea and ln A values as the fraction of mass conversion (α) increased,
indicating a multistep mechanism for ILs with complex anions (formed
by multiple atoms connected by covalent bonds). The Ea and ΔH‡ values
found for the IL series were similar in magnitude. Additionally, the
ΔH‡ follows the same trend
as the ΔG‡. The IL [BisOct(MIM)2][2X] with X = NO3 was the most
thermally stable structure, followed by BF4 > Br >
SCN
> NTf2, for 10 and 50% activity loss evaluated. The
low
stability of [BisOct(MIM)2][2NTf2] was attributed
to the release of SO2 groups from the anions. The kinetics
and thermodynamic parameters of activation furnished important information
about the thermal behavior of the structures. These data enabled the
estimation of the temperature range for correct and safe application.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
1,8-Dibromooctane,
1,8-dichlorooctane,
1-bromooctane, 1-methylimidazole, sodium tetrafluoroborate, silver
nitrate, potassium thiocyanate, and bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide
lithium salt were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The acetonitrile
and ethyl ether (HPLC grade) were purchased from Tedia (Rio de Janeiro,
RJ, Brazil). All of the chemical products were of high-grade purity
and used without further purification.

4.2 Synthesis
The ILs were synthesized
in accordance with methodologies previously described by Shirota et
al.50 and developed in our research group.32 The structures of all of the products were confirmed
by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy. All of the characterization
data of the ILs in this study are shown in the relevant reference.32

4.3 Partition Constants
To construct
a calibration curve, stock solutions of IL in water (200 mM) were
prepared by weighing the IL in a volumetric flask and using an analytical
balance with a precision of ±0.001 g (Marte AL 500, Brazil).
The volumetric flask was filled with double-distilled deionized Millipore
quality water (Elix-03, Barueri, Brazil; and Milli-Q, Molsheim, France).
Stock solutions were analyzed in the UV–vis spectrometer and
then further diluted to yield other concentrations to be analyzed.

The slow-stirring method was used to determine the partition constant
(KD°).22 Three milliliter of water
containing a known amount of IL (100 mM) was added to a flask and
then 1-octanol (3 mL) was carefully added. The sample was stirred
slowly for 24 h and then the water was separated from 1-octanol and
analyzed in an optical absorption spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 50
Bio UV/visible Spectrophotometer) at a temperature of 25 °C,
which was controlled using a Peltier cell. Both the nomenclature and
the symbol used for the partition constant (KD°) are in accordance
with IUPAC recommendations.51

4.4 NMR Measurements
The experiments
involving diffusion (D) and relaxation times (T1 and T2) were recorded
on a Bruker Avance III (1H at 600.13 MHz) at 298 K. NMR
tubes (5 mm) containing 50 mM of IL solution in water and a sealed
capillary tube with TMS diluted
in CDCl3 as the external reference (digital resolution
of ±0.01 ppm) were used. Chemical shifts were expressed in ppm.
An inversion recovery pulse sequence [180°x – τ – 90°x]n was used to measure the spin–lattice
relaxation time (T1) at 25 °C.52 Measurements of spin–spin relaxation
time (T2) at 25 °C were done using
the 90°x[τ – 180°y τ]n pulse
sequence based on the Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill
(CPMG) method. The self-diffusion coefficient (D)
was obtained via the pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) method, the
pulse sequence STEGP1S was used for samples at 25 °C. These experiments
were done to evaluate supramolecular assemblies and intermolecular
interactions of ILs in the solution.28,53−56

4.5 Thermal Analysis
Thermogravimetric
analysis was done on a TGA Q5000 (TA Instruments Inc.). The heating
rates were 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 °C min–1. The
N2 flow rate was 25 mL min–1 and the
temperature range was 298.15–973.15 K. The sample mass was
5–10 mg. The TGA equipment was calibrated by CaC2O4H2O (99.9%).

4.6 Toxicity
4.6.1 Worm Maintenance
C. elegans Bristol N2 (wild-type) was provided by
the Caenorhabditis Genetic Center (CGC, University of Minnesota).
All of the strains were grown at 20 °C on NGM plates (1.7% agar,
2.5 mg mL–1 peptone, 25 mM NaCl, 50 mM KH2PO4 pH 6.0, 5 μg mL–1 cholesterol,
1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4) with fresh Escherichia coli OP50 as the food source. For each
experiment, synchronized populations were obtained by the disruption
of gravid adults. Worms were grown to the L1 larval stage on NGM/OP50-seeded
plates.

4.6.2 C. elegans Experimental Treatments
L1 larval-stage worms were exposed
to ILs for 1 h at different concentrations. The worms were transferred
to 1.5 mL conical tubes containing M9 buffer, together with each respective
IL. The worms were kept under constant shaking for oxygenation. After
1 h, the worms were washed three times with M9 and transferred to
NGM plates seeded with OP50. After 24 h, we performed the survival
assay.
