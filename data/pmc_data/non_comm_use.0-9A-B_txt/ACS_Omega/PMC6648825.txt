This
publication describes a method for the quantification by high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) of resinous compounds known as α-acids
found in freshly harvested, unprocessed hops. This method provides
consistent, efficient, and accurate results as well as the theories
and rationale involved in HPLC method development. A system of quality
checks was utilized as well as the validation of numerous developmental
variables. By starting with a theoretical approach in preparation,
extraction, and instrumental techniques and then further developing
these practices by experimentation, a reproducible method was developed.
Following the validation, fresh cascade hops grown in Sonoma County
were analyzed during the 2017 harvest season and found to be within
the predicted range specific to this cultivar. This method encompasses
the techniques necessary to analyze fresh or dried hops, considering
variability between different laboratories.

==== Body
Introduction
Hops are used in the
production of beer because of their unique
chemical compounds, which contribute bitterness, flavor, and aroma.
These compounds are produced and contained within a hop’s lupulin
glands.1 The first category of compounds
found within these glands are a variety of volatile hydrocarbons known
as essential oils, which give beer distinct flavor and aroma profiles
depending on the types of hops used. These profiles can be described
as piney, floral, or citrus. To increase the concentration of these
essential oils in a beer, brewers use the process of “dry hopping”
where hops are added to cooled beer after fermentation. Adding hops
at this point of the brewing process provides a stable environment
for the extraction of these oils, minimizing loss because of evaporation.
The second category of compounds found within the lupulin glands are
resinous amphiphilic molecules known as α-acids and β-acids,
which give a bitter taste to the beer. See Figure 1 for α-acid and β-acid molecular
structures. This bitterness is attained by boiling these acids in
the slightly acidic “wort”, which is water with a concentrated
amount of unfermented maltose. Bitterness is attributed to the isomerization
of α-acids such as humulone to its counterpart isohumulone.2 Craft breweries report this perceived bitterness
in International Bittering Units (IBUs), which is an estimation based
on the concentration of α-acids that are isomerized.2 The IBU calculation requires the weight of hops
added along with the percent (weight/weight) of α-acids and
the amount of time the mixture is left to boil. β-Acids on the
other hand oxidize to give a bitter profile. The oxidation happens
at a much slower rate, but the rate increases when left to age in
a warm environment. The preoxidized β-acids are insoluble in
the wort; therefore, β-acids are not taken into consideration
when calculating a beer’s IBUs.3 Overall, these compounds interact with a beer to balance the burning
taste of alcohol as well as the sweetness of residual maltose. Hops
are also known to contribute to antimicrobial activity and retention
of the beer’s foamy head.

adhumulone, colupulone,
lupulone, and adlupulone.

With craft beer becoming more popular within the alcoholic
beverage
industry as well as with home brewers, demand for hops and the testing
of their chemical makeup have increased. Hops may be purchased in
bulk on an industrial level or in gram quantities for small batch
home brewers. Consumers also have the option of choosing between packaged
hops in the natural cone state or a condensed pelletized form. While
this has increased the availability of hops globally, brewers lose
a large amount of essential oils because of evaporation as the hops
must be dried to 10% moisture content before being packaged to prevent
spoilage.4 This has shaped a seasonal tradition
in Sonoma County of producing “wet hopped” beers where
brewers work with growers to make beer using hops freshly harvested
from the bine. With the utilization of fresh hops in the brewing industry,
an accurate method for testing α-acids with considerations of
a fresh cone’s higher moisture content was needed.

The
focus of this publication is to describe a method for the quantification
of α-acids (cohumulone, humulone, and adhumulone) in freshly
harvested hops by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC), utilizing ultraviolet detection and an external standard.
This method advances previously described methods5,6 by
considering the unique composition of fresh hops, implementing a system
of quality checks, maintaining chromatographic separation while reducing
the retention range, and reducing solvent consumption. Also, common
problems an analyst may encounter with suggested solutions are communicated
throughout this publication. This methodology was applied in the analysis
of fresh hops during the 2017 Sonoma County harvest season.

Materials
and Methods
Instrumentation
The chromatographic system used is
a Thermo Finnigan Surveyor HPLC; a binary MS Pump Plus was utilized
with an A/S Lite Plus Autosampler injecting 10 μL per sample
and a PDA Plus detector operating at a wavelength of 233 nm. The average
maximum absorbance wavelength of all four samples was found by analyzing
standards with a variable wavelength detector operating at the range
of 200–600 nm. Xcalibur 2.0.7 software was used to run the
sequences and automate the integration of chromatograms. A Phenomenex
Luna, C-18, 5μ, 150 × 4.6 mm column was used to provide
sufficient separation and accurate quantitation. Each injection had
a 30 min run time with a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min.

Eluents used
were (A) methanol/0.17% formic acid in water (85:15 v/v %) and a gradient
of (B) 100% water. See Table 1 for gradient parameters. This gradient of increased water
concentration was necessary to separate α-acids (analyte peaks
a and b) because of their similar chemical properties and therefore
similar selectivity values. After the elution of both α-acid
peaks, the gradient was returned to 100% mobile phase (A) to decrease
the retention range and tailing of the later eluting β-acids
(analyte peaks c and d). A typical chromatogram of a standard and
sample injections is shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. For this
specific system, an instantaneous jump was introduced from 0 to 10%
(B) and 90% (A) at t = 8.00 min, followed by a linear
gradient back to 100% (A). The gradient returned to 100% (A) at t = 13.00 min. The jump in water concentration was done
earlier than the normal elution time of the first analyte peak to
allow a sufficient amount of time for the increased water gradient
to reach the compounds when moving through the system at 0.8 mL/min.
The gradient parameters may need to be adjusted depending on the specific
gradient delay volume which is defined as the total volume between
the point of gradient mixing and column inlet.

Reagents
The reagents used consisted of HPLC grade
methanol, peroxide-free diethyl ether, 98% formic acid, and 0.1 M
hydrochloric acid. Millipore Milli-Q water was used. The external
standard used is known as the International Calibration Extract (ICE-3),
which has reported concentrations of α-acids and β-acids.
This standard is from The American Society of Brewing Chemists located
in St. Paul, MN.

Chromatographic Mobile Phase—Methanol/0.17%
Formic Acid
in Water (85:15 v/v %)
The main eluent used is a mixture
of methanol and formic acid in water. To accurately adjust the pH
of the mobile phase, it is necessary to adjust the water portion in
its aqueous state with 98% formic acid until reaching a pH of 2.6.
Adjusting the pH in an aqueous solution will increase the preparation’s
reproducibility compared to adjusting a solution of highly concentrated
organic solvent.7 Formic acid was the acidifying
agent of choice because of its pKa value
of 3.74 at 25 °C with a UV cutoff at 210 nm.8 Phosphate is also an applicable buffer option. A pH of
2.6 was used because of the analyte pKas which ranged from 4.25 to
5.93 to avoid variability in spacing and resolution.9,10 See Table 2 for a
summary of chemical properties for all six analytes.11 After the pH adjustment, we combined 85 parts of methanol
with 15 parts of the water–formic acid mixture. It is important
to ensure that the mobile phase is mixed well, filtered, and degassed.

adlupulone	 	99.8	–0.001	414.5822	5.38	
The mobile phase pH should be at
least 1–2 units from the
compound analyte pKa.9,10 Utilizing
ARChem’s physiochemical calculator SPARC at the pH of 2.6, all analytes are
theoretically calculated to be completely protonated, which is ideal
for chromatography purposes. Refer to Figure 1 for the analyte neutral structures. With
a high percent of nonionized single species compounds, molecular charge
is decreased, in turn reducing compound retention variability.

Note that an isocratic method is an option if a binary pump is
not available. However, the analyst will more than likely need to
increase the concentration of water within the mobile phase, which
will produce increased run times and increased peak tailing. The aqueous
pH should be adjusted to 2.6 regardless of which method the analyst
chooses.

Procedure
Standard Solutions: ICE-3
Standard (1.0 mg/mL)
A single-point
calibration of ICE-3 in methanol with a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL
was utilized for quantification. Standard stability, when stored in
cool conditions and protected from light, was found to be 24 h.12 To ensure accuracy, working standard injections
should have an analyte peak % relative standard deviation (RSD) of
<3.0% for both standard injections of n = 5 (first
standard injections) and n = all (bracketing standard
injections included). See eq 1 for the calculation of working standard suitability. To ensure
standard precision, it is suggested to prepare this solution in duplicate.
With known concentrations of both the working and check standards,
the analyst can confirm standard accuracy. Standard suitability can
be calculated with eqs 2 and 3, and the calculated check standard concentration
should be within 3.0% of the actual concentration.

First, the
response factor (RF) of α-acids from the working standards (n = all) should be calculated. Next, the RF value should
be used to calculate the check standard’s concentration by
system response and compare that value to the recorded concentration
from the raw data recorded.

Sample Preparation
The hop samples
used in this study
were donated by members of the Nor-Cal Hop Growers Alliance with farms
located throughout Sonoma County, California. Before extracting the
samples, the moisture content was analyzed by a gravimetric method.5 This technique is necessary as a form of pretreatment
by removing all volatile and semivolatile components as well as being
utilized in the final w/w % calculations for precise quantitation.
The extraction process of freshly harvested hops utilizes liquid–liquid
extraction to separate analyte molecules from contaminants. Because
of the amphiphilic characteristics of α-acids and β-acids,
diethyl ether is used as the extracting solvent with a 5:1 ratio of
methanol. After the acids have been extracted from the plant matter,
0.1 M HCl is added to separate analytes and contaminants. The 0.1
M HCl solvent not only filters out the polar contaminants but also
displaces them to the bottom layer because of its higher solvent density
(Figure 4). This is
a preferred extraction technique making analytes easily accessible
to aliquot from the top layer. After analyzing both top and bottom
layers, the extraction efficiency was found to be acceptable with
negligible α-acids and no β-acids in the bottom layer.
It is suggested to extract samples in duplicate in order to minimize
sample homogeneity variances.

layering.

Suggested Sequence Order
The suggested sequence order
is as follows: zero injection, blank, five working standards, one
check standard, and up to six sample injections for every bracketing
standard. When first attempting this method, it is suggested to run
two blanks after both a standard and sample to confirm that there
are no carryover peaks that will affect the accuracy or system suitability
of the sequence. If carryover peaks of the analytes are present in
either of the blanks, a prolonged syringe wash of 100% methanol may
be necessary. If interfering peaks continue to be a problem, a blank
after every standard and sample injection to flush the system is suggested.
If the carryover peaks are below 0.1% of the area of any respective
analyte peak, the carryover may be considered negligible.

Results
and Discussion
Chromatography
Under these separation
conditions, the
first eluting analyte peak is (a) cohumulone, followed by (b) coeluting
adhumulone and humulone, followed by (c) colupulone, and last (d)
coeluting adlupulone and lupulone. These chromatograms offer desired
and repeatable separation between peaks and are obtained within 30
min for a relatively low retention range. In this method, a possible
source of error can be attributed to the lack of resolution between
two α-acid peaks. The ideal resolution between peaks is >1.5
and can be calculated with eq 4.13 Several unidentified components
were observed. However, they did not interfere with analyte peaks,
so accuracy was retained. With the narrow peaks observed, a high signal-to-noise
ratio was obtained. The variability of sample injections was analyzed
by calculating the average difference between the duplicate injections
and determined to be 0.30% with a standard deviation of 0.26% and
a maximum difference of 0.83%.

Linearity
During
method development, the response linearity
was tested over a large concentration range of 0–3.0 mg/mL.
Excellent linearity was provided for all four analyte peaks. Also,
in each sequence, a three-point calibration curve was applied to prove
the reliability of utilizing the single-point 1.0 mg/mL working standard
for quantification. With a standard concentration ranging from 0.5463
to 1.6389 mg/mL, the responses for both α-acid and β-acid
analyte peaks produced adequate linearity (R2 = 0.997 or higher) with a forced intercept of zero. See Figure 5 for an example calibration
curve portraying the response because of the variable concentration
of α-acid peak 2, coeluting adhumulone and humulone.

calibration curve of coeluting peaks humulone and adhumulone
from a standard concentration range of 0.5463–1.6389 mg/mL.

Example Calculations
See eq 5 to calculate
moisture content and eq 6 to calculate a sample’s
acid concentration.

Sample and Standard Calculations
During this study,
actual samples were collected and stored at 4 °C for roughly
12 h prior to being analyzed. Excel was used for all calculations
with intermediates left unrounded throughout and reported results
rounded to two decimal places. For this sequence, the working standard
% RSD was 2.3% for n = 5 and 1.9% for n = all. The standard agreement was 100.05%. Refer to the Supporting Information for sample calculations.
Results for the α-acid concentrations of hops are reported in
both their freshly harvested form and packaged conditions of 10% moisture
content. β-Acids are calculated by the same procedure. As previously
mentioned, the effect of β-acid on overall bitterness contributes
a small fraction to that of its counterpart. Therefore, β-acids
are not included in the calculation of IBUs and are not reported on
most hops that are packaged for sale.

Limitations
Sample
size, sample collection, and lab
error were the main limitations during this study. Samples were collected
from a single hop plant for every time point analyzed. Although this
showed how a single plant matured during harvest, it did not consider
the variability between plants on a farm. Also, there was variability
in how each sample was collected; ideally you would want to create
a homogeneous sample by collecting hops throughout the bine. Last,
lab error was a considerable limitation, although measures were taken
to reduce variability and error. When working with biological samples,
there is concern regarding homogeneity. To limit this, extracting
larger sample sizes multiple times would be necessary.

Discussion
This method contributes to previous methods5,6 with
its consideration of an evolving brewing industry and its use
of fresh “wet” hops, enabling brewers to report a beer’s
perceived bitterness. This method is applicable from an industrial
standpoint for hop growers and brewers alike who want to fully inform
their consumers about their product. This publication along with the Supporting Information has used the procedure
of analyzing fresh hops step by step and made it accessible for chemists
with minimal analytical liquid chromatography experience. It has provided
the option of utilizing numerous pharmaceutical grade quality checks
to ensure precise quantitation.

During the study of the 2017
Sonoma County hop harvest, results were collected for hops used in
numerous “wet” hopped beers in breweries throughout
Sonoma County. This study attempted to limit as many variables between
multiple farms as possible by analyzing hops of the same cultivar
and origin that were planted in the same year. The Northern California
Hop Growers Alliance also utilized universal growing conditions among
the members participating in this study such as the average distance
between rhizomes, daily water intake, and soil amendments. Problems
associated with small-scale hop cultivation include knowing when to
harvest as well as knowing the chemical makeup of those hops. Without
access to a lab, harvesters judge the maturity and ideal harvest time
of a hop plant based on the cone moisture content and perceived aromas.14 The goal of this research is to develop a method
for analyzing fresh hops as well as comparing the chemical profile
and peak harvest time differences between hops grown in Sonoma County
to those grown in Yakima, WA. See Table 3 for a result summary including moisture
content and calculated α-acid concentrations at harvest as well
as in packaged conditions. These results generally confirmed that
the α-acid concentrations found within the cascade cultivar
are between 5 and 7% as far south as the 38th parallel where Sonoma
County lies. These data give legitimacy to small hop farmers in Sonoma
County, which in turn increased the acreage of hop plants in the area
as well as instilled confidence in the quality of the product for
consumers. From these results, a direct correlation between the cone
moisture content and α-acid concentration is not observed. Parts
of Sonoma County received rainfall multiple times over the course
of this study in addition to having varying humidity levels. Both
of these factors significantly affect the hop moisture content. This
explains the irregular observations in moisture content during the
2017 harvest season. It should be noted that a significant amount
of variability of α-acid concentration was observed depending
on the date samples were harvested from that plant. This affirms that
the time of harvest is an important factor in hop cultivation. It
is also worth noting that the one sample harvested in the same year
it was planted had the lowest concentration of bittering acids, suggesting
that a hop plant needs one full season to fully mature.

Previous methods, such as
Hops 145 from the ASBC and
HPLC analysis of α- and β-acids in Hops from the Journal
of Chemical Education,6 focus on analyzing
processed hops in a pelletized matrix. With this method, fresh hops
can be analyzed and the moisture content can be used to quantify the
acids as well as predict concentrations after processing. This is
an important factor for everybody involved in the brewing industry.
The preparation of mobile phase was improved upon by adjusting the
aqueous portion to a specific pH giving chromatograms consistent retention
for each analyte peak. This is necessary when quantifying compounds
by improving the peak shape for undeviating integration. All the calculations
needed to observe system suitability such as peak resolution and standard
precision are included in this method along with suggested criteria
based off of suggestions from the United States Pharmacopeia ⟨621⟩.
Also, sample and standard calculations are left in a broad format
for labs without the specific glassware used in this method. This
procedure was made to be user-friendly and rugged across all labs
in order to reduce time in method development as well as reducing
costs of lab supplies.

Conclusions
This method is an example
of how freshly harvested hops can be
analyzed. This procedure is preferred over previous methods because
of its considerations of sample moisture content, accuracy, efficiency,
and system variability. Accurate quantification is ensured with the
application of multiple calibration standards, a check standard, and
an efficient sample extraction method. Run times have been reduced
to below 30 min while also decreasing the flow rate for an efficient
use of solvent. Also, variability in peak retention has been reduced
by using a mobile phase with a specific pH. This method addresses
common problems with HPLC method development and explains general
solutions. This makes it an applicable method for less-experienced
analysts and helps the user develop their own method for their specific
system.
