A series of monometallic
pentacoordinate FeIII chloride
complexes have been prepared and characterized by high-resolution
mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. X-ray diffraction analysis
showed that the bis-chelated FeIII complexes bear distorted
trigonal bipyramidal geometries. The air- and moisture-stable FeIII complexes were screened as mediators in the reverse atom
transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of styrene and methyl methacrylate.
Moderate to excellent control was achieved with dispersities as low
as 1.1 for both poly(methyl methacrylate) and polystyrene. Kinetic
studies showed living characteristics, and end group analysis revealed
the presence of olefin-terminated polymer chains, suggesting catalytic
chain transfer as a competing polymerization mechanism. Although the
catalysts are not the fastest Fe ATRP mediators, they are robust and
flexible. Using propylene oxide as an initiator, the complexes were
active catalysts for the ring-opening polymerization of rac-lactide with moderate control. While the addition of propylene oxide
has been reported as an efficient method of converting a metal–halide
bond to a metal–alkoxide bond in situ, we show herein that
this initiation mechanism can limit polymerization reproducibility
and introduce an induction period.

Introduction
Transition-metal complexes
play an important role in the catalysis
of polymerization reactions, from providing better control over the
microstructure to tuning the properties of the obtained polymers.1 Non-toxic iron is an ideal candidate to be used
for this purpose as the removal of catalyst residues from polymer
products is still a major challenge for food or biomedical applications.2−4 Moreover, as Fe is the most abundant transition metal, it can maintain
low costs even on industrial scales.5,6 With multiple
active oxidation states, most commonly FeII and FeIII, to exploit in different catalytic processes, research
in Fe-based catalysts has become an area of focus in polymer chemistry;
complexes supported with a range of ligands have been characterized
and applied in various types of polymerizations.1,7−9

Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP)
is based on a dynamic
equilibrium between the growing and the dormant polymer chains using
a metal-mediated halogen-exchange process (Scheme 1). As an alternative to the typical Cu-based
systems,10 the first Fe catalysts for ATRP
were pioneered by the groups of Matyjaszewski and Sawamoto, originally
using FeIIX2(PR3)2 (X
= Cl and Br)-type complexes.11,12 Since then, Fe salts
and complexes with a variety of ligands (including phosphines, imines,
and amines) have been explored in the ATRP of vinyl monomers,7,13,14 but interestingly the use of
the ubiquitous salen ligand framework gave only limited control over
the polymerization.15 Catalysts with Fe
in its more stable oxidation state can have the additional benefit
of air and moisture stability that enables simple, user-friendly synthesis
and application. These systems traditionally feature an azo initiator
(such as AIBN) and proceed via a reverse ATRP (R-ATRP) mechanism (Scheme 1). The first examples
of Fe-mediated R-ATRP were reported by Teyssié et al.,16 whereas amine bisphenolate complexes of both
FeII and FeIII showed good control in the RP
of styrene and methyl methacrylate (MMA),17−21 through joint ATRP and organometallic-mediated radical
polymerization mechanisms.22,23

Scheme 1 Mechanism of Fe-Mediated
ATRP and R-ATRP
The ring-opening polymerization
(ROP) of cyclic esters, in particular
the renewable cyclic diester lactide, is a burgeoning component of
sustainable polymer development.24 Industrially,
poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is formed via the ROP of lactide catalyzed
by Sn carboxylates. These catalysts require harsh reaction conditions,
show limited control over the polymerization, and can cause toxicity
problems in biomedical applications. An intense effort to develop
well-defined, single site catalysts to achieve a better control over
the dispersity and tacticity has led to a plethora of new catalysts
for this reaction, including limited reports with some Cu complexes
with relevance to ATRP.25−28 Iron catalysts are attractive alternatives because
of their low cost and biocompatibility, but surprisingly few papers
report efficient Fe ROP catalyst systems.29−36 Byers and co-workers developed a range of bis(imino)pyridine Fe
alkoxide catalysts and showed that the polymerization was sensitive
to both oxidation state and electron density of Fe.9,37 Salen
complexes of FeII aalso catalyzed the ROP of l-LA.38 Following the recent trend of using
propylene oxide (PO)-triggered initiations,39−42 Duan et al. reported on the in
situ generation of salen-based FeIII–alkoxide catalysts
for the ROP of lactide and caprolactone.43 The proposed mechanism suggests the insertion of PO into the Fe–Cl
bond to form the catalytically active Fe–alkoxide (Scheme 2). Similar to Al-based
systems,39 the addition of a massive excess
(2000 equivalents) of the carcinogenic PO was required to achieve
good conversions, hence greatly reducing the atom efficiency and biocompatibility
of this system.

Scheme 2 Coordination–Insertion Mechanism of in Situ
Fe–Alkoxide-Catalyzed
Lactide Polymerization
Complimentary to the well-studied tetradentate salen systems,
tridentate
derivatives of Schiff bases were also applied to support FeIII as a polymerization catalyst.44 Considering
the paucity of studies exploring Fe complexes with bidentate phenoxyimine
ligands,45−47 we recently developed a novel family of air-stable
half salen FeIII chloride catalysts that showed high activity
in CO2/epoxide couplings.48 In
these reactions, the conformational flexibility of the complexes proved
to be an advantage over the standard salen scaffolds. The presence
of the Fe–Cl bond in these catalysts opened up the possibility
of their applications in R-ATRP (Scheme 1) and ROP (Scheme 2) reactions. Half salen ligands offer the
advantage of simple and modular synthesis to achieve stereoelectronically
diverse properties (Figure 1). Aluminum complexes of these ligands have shown promising
results in the ROP of cyclic esters,49 including
the application of monometallic Al–phenoxyimines in the ROP
of γ-butyrolactone50 and the stereocontrolled
ROP of lactide.51 Moreover, dimeric, oxygen-bridged
Li, Na, and K phenoxyimine complexes were extremely active in the
ROP of lactide; however, these systems exerted a lower control over
molecular weights and tacticity.52

Figure 1 General structure
of a bis-chelated half salen complex.

This work explores the synthesis of five bidentate phenoxyimine
ligands, the corresponding novel FeIII chloride complexes,
and their application in polymerization catalysis. Combined with the
previously reported complexes, all eight Fe–phenoxyimines were
screened as mediators in the R-ATRP of styrene and MMA. Moreover,
we explored the PO-triggered ROP of rac-lactide,
including understanding the limitations of this emerging initiation
strategy.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization
A
series of FeIII complexes were synthesized from half salen
ligands, incorporating
substituents with varying steric bulk [methyl or 2,6-diisopropylphenyl
(DIPP)] at the imine position and peripheral Cl or tBu substituents on the phenol moiety.52,53 Initially, the pro-ligands were deprotonated by NaH to form the
corresponding Na–phenolates. Subsequent transmetalation with
anhydrous FeCl3 (0.5 equiv) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvent
at ambient temperature gave an immediate color change from yellow
to dark purple, which indicated the formation of the desired L2FeCl complexes (C1–C8). The resulting
Fe complexes were isolated in moderate to high yields (45–89%)
as dark purple-brown solids. As the paramagnetically shifted 1H NMR spectra of the complexes provided limited information,
the stoichiometry was confirmed with high-resolution mass spectrometry
and elemental analysis. All eight complexes were oxygen and moisture
stable, and single crystals of C5, C6, and C8 were obtained under air via
the slow evaporation of the dichloromethane (DCM) solvent (Scheme 3). X-ray diffraction
studies revealed that all three complexes display a mononuclear structure
with distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometries (τ = 0.94, 0.87,
and 0.66 for C5, C6, and C8, respectively) around the pentacoordinate FeIII center,
using the τ factor developed by Addison et al. (where τ
= 0 for perfect square pyramidal and τ = 1 for perfect trigonal
bipyramidal geometries).54 In line with
the previously reported molecular structures of C1, C3 and C7,48C5 and C8, both feature a N–Fe–N
axis which is almost linear [C5, N(1)–Fe(1)–N(1′),
177.44(5)°; C8, N(1)–Fe(1)–N(2), 169.98(6)°],
with one Cl and two phenoxy-O centers occupying the equatorial positions
(Figures 2 and 3). In contrast, C6 displays an O–Fe–O
axis [O(1)–Fe(1)–O(2), 173.7(2)°]. This switch
in axial and equatorial occupants may arise from the significant increase
in steric bulk of the DIPP imine substituents. For C5, C6, and C8 (Figure 4), the bond metrics are comparable to previously
reported Fe half salen complexes,55−59 with Fe–N bond lengths ranging from 2.101(1)
to 2.111(1) Å and Fe–O bond lengths of 1.8757(9)–1.911
(1) Å. For all six structurally characterized complexes, the
ancillary phenoxyimine ligands are arranged such that both nitrogen
and oxygen atoms are in mutually trans positions. These geometries
differ significantly from those observed with FeIII salen
and salalen complexes, which typically possess a square pyramidal
geometry with mutually cis N and O ligands.41,43 Upon the introduction of electronegative chloro substituents to
the ligand scaffold, the Fe–Cl bond length is significantly
shortened and strengthened, from 2.2713(5) Å for unsubstituted C1,48 to 2.2517(6) Å for monochloro-substituted C7 and to 2.2271(5) Å for ortho, para-dichloro-substituted C8. The magnetic
moments of all eight complexes were determined via the Evans method
and displayed μeff values of 4.6–5.5 B. M.,
which suggests that high
spin FeIII complexes predominate.60

Scheme 3 Synthesis of FeIII complexes C1–C8
Atom Transfer Radial Polymerization
Complexes C1–C8 were screened as mediators
in the R-ATRP of styrene
using the standard AIBN initiator at 120 °C or an alternative
azo-initiator (V-70) which ‘degrades quickly to radicals at
75 °C (Table 1). As expected, the lower temperature of reaction used with V-70
leads to lower conversions and slightly narrower molecular weight
distributions. Following the Fe–Cl bond strengths, the conversion
increased with the Lewis acidity of the Fe center using AIBN and C1, C7, and C8 as mediators (entries
1, 13, and 15). Surprisingly, along with providing one of the highest
conversions (56%), C8 also displayed good control over
the dispersities, with D̵ values (1.2, entries
15 and 16) that are comparable with the best reported for FeIII R-ATRP systems.19,61 Of particular interest, catalyst C6 was an excellent mediator using V-70, affording polystyrene
with very narrow dispersity (D̵ = 1.05, entry
12) with matching theoretical and experimental molecular weights.
This may suggest that the bulky tBu substituents
can sterically stabilize the reduced FeII derivative during
the R-ATRP process. The presence of these electron-donating groups
may also decrease the Lewis acidity of the metal center and therefore
limit the concentration of active chains. On the contrary, when L6 was investigated by Gibson et al. in a mono-chelated FeLCl2-type complex, poor control was achieved, attributed to the
relative instability of the reduced tricoordinate FeII species
formed during polymerization.44 Interestingly, C5 with identical tBu substituents
on the phenol moiety displayed significantly lower control, which
can be linked to the lack of steric hindrance and thus protection
of the coordination sphere by the DIPP group on the imine. Complexes C3 and C4 provided a moderate degree of control
(D̵ = 1.4–1.5), whereas C1, C2, C5, and C7 were relatively
poor mediators providing broad dispersities (D̵ > 1.5). These findings suggest that overall, the steric bulk
at
the imine position (Me or DIPP substituents) does not have a significant
effect upon the degree of control. In some cases (e.g., entries 3–4
and 9–10), the number average molecular weights (Mn) were higher than the theoretical values (Mn,th), suggesting inefficient initiation.

b Insufficient polymer was precipitated
after 2 h to allow analysis; therefore, a sample precipitated after
4 h reaction time was used.

Kinetic experiments were performed using complex C8,
which exerted the highest control over dispersity using AIBN as
the initiator. The molecular weights increased linearly with conversion,
suggesting a controlled polymerization. The reaction kinetics deviated
from the expected first-order dependence on monomer concentration,
which may be due to the presence of competing side reactions (vide
infra) (Figure 5).

plots for styrene polymerization: ln([M]0/[M]t)
vs time (on left) and molecular weight vs conversion (right).

To provide insight into the nature
of the polymer end groups, the
purified polystyrene samples were investigated by 1H NMR
spectroscopy. Besides the expected halide capping group (ClCH(Ph)CH2 at 4.4 ppm), the presence of olefin-terminated
polymer chains was also observed, as indicated by diagnostic doublets
at 5.27 and 5.78 ppm (Figure 6). These findings suggest that catalytic chain-transfer (CCT)
side reactions occur, which compete with the ATRP mechanism.18 However, molecular weights increased linearly
with the conversion, as observed previously for intermediate spin
α-diimine Fe complexes.62,63

The R-ATRP of MMA using C1–C8 as mediators
afforded polymers with Mn significantly
in excess of the theoretical values (Mn,th), which is a common phenomenon using this monomer with azo initiators
(AIBN and V-70).17 Similarly to the styrene
polymerizations, using C1, C3, and C5 as mediators, the conversion increased with the presence
of sterically bulky tBu substituents on
the half salen ligand scaffold (Table 2, entries 1, 5 and 9). The complexes were found to
be moderate to poor mediators achieving relatively broad dispersities
(D̵ = 1.4–2.3). The exception was the
unsubstituted complex C1, which achieved moderate activities
(28–30% conversion) while exerting good control (D̵ = 1.1 and 1.2 using AIBN and V-70, respectively). This observation
is consistent with the general principle in normal ATRP, where the
mediator must be fine-tuned so that the polymerization rate is sufficiently
rapid, but not so active that radical termination dominates the reaction.64

Kinetic experiments using C1 showed that
the polymerization
was well controlled; the molecular weight increased linearly with
conversion. However, the reaction slowed down considerably, reaching
a plateau at moderate conversions (Figure 7), possibly because of bimolecular termination
side reactions.7 Similarly to the polystyrene
samples, 1H NMR analysis revealed the presence of olefin-terminated
polymer chains (doublets at 5.50 and 6.23 ppm, Figure S14). However, the integrals of these peaks were relatively
low compared to the polymer peaks, which suggested significantly less
CCT than that observed for styrene.

Ring-Opening Polymerization of rac-Lactide
Iron catalysts remain underexplored within ring-opening polymerization
reactions, yet can offer benefits in terms of low cost, biocompatibility,
and air stability. Complexes C1–C8 were therefore
tested as catalysts for the ROP of lactide (LA). Most catalysts for
this reaction include a metal–alkoxide initiating group, which
is typically formed via the in situ conversion of a metal–alkyl
group through deprotonation of an alcohol.25 The in situ generation of metal–alkoxide catalysts through
the addition of an epoxide to metal–chlorides is currently
gaining momentum as an alternative initiation method (Scheme 2),41,43 thus we tested our Fe–Cl complexes for the ROP of rac-LA in the presence of PO as an activator. On previously
reported procedures,41,43 we aimed to avoid the use of
a large excess of PO, which would compromise the benefits of the Fe/LA
system because of the toxicity of this solvent. Initial optimization
of the [Fe]/PO ratio with C8 showed that excellent conversions
can be achieved with as low as 50 equivalents of PO when the reaction
is carried out at 120 °C for 24 h in the toluene solvent (Table S1, entries 1–4). This modification
enabled the polymerizations to be performed in airtight vials instead
of autoclaves and significantly improved the overall atom efficiency.
Control reactions without an Fe complex and without the addition of
PO showed that both components are essential for the initiation (Table 3, entries 1 and 2).
Under the optimized conditions, C1–C8 all achieved
almost complete conversion of LA (>89%), although inconsistent
molecular
weights and broad dispersities indicated uncontrolled polymerizations
(Table 3, entries 3–10).
This was attributed to detrimental side reactions, such as intramolecular
and intermolecular transesterifications, which are a commonly observed
in ROP at high conversions.25 The tacticity
was investigated via homonuclear decoupled 1H NMR experiments
of the purified polymers, which revealed a lack of control over the
tacticity with Pi values around 0.52 indicating
atactic enchainments (Figure S15). To reduce
the rate of undesired side reactions, the polymerization was tested
under milder conditions (85 °C), affording only traces of PLA
(Table S1, entry 5). Attempts to reduce
the reaction time from 24 to 2 h using C1–C8 led
to variable conversions (Table 3, entries 11–18) with significant errors in reproducibility
(Table S1, entries 6–9), suggesting
that the rate-limiting step is the in situ formation of the active
Fe–alkoxide catalyst. It may also suggest the presence of an
induction period for the epoxide ring opening by the metal–halide,
a phenomenon that was previously often observed in epoxide/CO2 copolymerization reactions,65−67 but may have been overlooked
in the in situ formation of metal–alkoxide catalysts for ROP.
The higher average molecular weights observed after 2 h of reaction
time (compared to 24 h reactions) suggest the presence of extensive
transesterification reactions that cleave longer polymer chains.24 Efforts to minimize the variability through
the use of a PO stock solution or a higher boiling activator (butylene
oxide, bp 63 °C) were unsuccessful (Table S1, entries 6–12). The inefficient initiation observed
after 2 h of reaction time using C2, C5, C7, and C8 (Table 3, entries 12, 15, 17, and 18, respectively) may arise
from the strength of the Fe–Cl bond. For example, the molecular
structures of C1, C7, and C8 suggest that the presence of electronegative chloro-substituents
shortens and strengthens the Fe–Cl bond (vide supra). This
falls in line with the conversions obtained with C1 (78%,
entry 11), C7 (49%, entry 17), and C8 (1%,
entry 18). These results suggest that in situ initiation can lead
to greater
experimental variation in comparison to the use of isolated metal–alkoxide
complexes. Indeed, preforming the active Fe–alkoxide species
by stirring the FeIII–Cl species C8 with excess PO for 16 h, prior to the addition of LA, drastically
increased the conversion from 1% (entry 18) to 90% (entry 19). Moreover,
using the preformed catalyst, the reaction temperature could be lowered
to 85 °C while maintaining high activity (89%, Table 3, entry 20). In accordance with
initiation via epoxide opening, the matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-ToF) spectrum of the purified polymer
showed a series of chains terminated by −OCH(Me)CH2Cl and −OH groups (Figures S19 and S20). Additional polymer series bearing −OCH(Me)CH2OH end groups were also observed, suggesting that initiation also
occurs through the opening of epoxide due to the presence of trace
water. In addition to the expected lactide repeat units (144 Da),
the spectra also showed equally intense repeating units corresponding
to a half lactide unit (72 Da), which further corroborates the prevalence
of transesterification reactions. It is worth noting that poly(propylene
oxide) was absent from both the MALDI-ToF and the NMR spectra of the
polymer products, suggesting that no polymerization of the epoxide
occurred.

a Conditions:
[lactide]/[Fe]/[PO]
= 100:1:50, lactide concentration in toluene = 1 M, 120 °C. Conversion
was determined using 1H NMR spectra of crude reaction mixtures. Mn,th [Fe] = [lactide]0/[Fe]
× M(lactide) × conversion.

b Reaction was carried out without
the addition of PO.

c Efforts
to recover polymer were
unsuccessful, indicating the formation of shorter polymer chains.

d The Fe complex was stirred
for 16
h in excess PO at room temperature prior to the addition of lactide.

e The reaction was performed
at 85
°C.

Conclusions
In summary, five new monometallic pentacoordinate FeIII chloride complexes were prepared based on a half salen ligand scaffold.
The complexes were characterized through a combination of elemental
analysis, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and in three cases, X-ray
crystallography. Combined with three previously reported analogues,
this series of eight complexes bearing a range of ligand substituents
has been tested as mediators in the R-ATRP of styrene and MMA, achieving
good to moderate control over the polymerization. The complexes have
also been applied in the ROP of rac-lactide, generally
giving >95% conversion after 24 h and showing that the in situ
formation
of FeIII–alkoxide via epoxide opening is necessary
for efficient initiation. Although this method of initiation is currently
gaining momentum within ROP, some of our FeIII half salen
catalysts give little or no conversion after 2 h, suggesting that
epoxide opening by a metal–halide may require an extreme excess
of toxic epoxide (i.e., as a solvent) to achieve control. In general,
these results demonstrate the versatility of simple, air-stable FeIII half salen complexes and show that this abundant, inexpensive,
and non-toxic metal can be a relevant alternative in polymerization
catalysis.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
All air- and/or
moisture-sensitive
experiments were performed under argon atmosphere using an MBRAUN
LABmaster glovebox and standard Schlenk techniques. Solvents were
obtained from a solvent purification system (Innovative Technologies)
consisting of columns of alumina and copper catalyst and were further
degassed by freeze–pump–thaw cycles prior to use. Styrene
and MMA were dried by stirring over calcium hydride, vacuum transferred,
and stored at −35 °C. rac-Lactide was
sublimed three times and stored at −35 °C. 2,2′-Azobis(4-methoxy-2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile)
(V-70) was washed with methanol, dried under vacuum, and stored at
−35 °C. 2,2′-Azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) (AIBN)
was recrystallized from methanol, dried under vacuum, and stored at
−35 °C. 2,6-Di-isopropylaniline was distilled under vacuum
prior to use. N-Methylamine (40 m/m % in H2O), salicylaldehyde, 3,5-dichlorosalicylaldehyde, and 3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylaldehyde were used as received. Gel permeation
chromatography (GPC) was carried out in the HPLC grade THF solvent
at a flow rate of 1 mL/min at 35 °C on a Malvern Instruments
Viscotek 270 GPC Max triple detection system with 2× mixed bed
styrene/DVB columns (300 × 7.5 mm). Absolute molar masses were
obtained using the refractive index increment (dn/dc values) for this sample/solvent combination
of 0.185 mL/g for poly(styrene),68 0.088
mL/g for poly(methyl methacrylate),69 and
0.05 mL/g for PLA.70 NMR spectra were obtained
on a 500 MHz Bruker AVANCE III spectrometer. Solution magnetic moments
were determined via NMR spectroscopy using Evans’ method.60 EI mass spectra were obtained on a Bruker DALTONICS
micro TOF instrument operating in the positive ion electrospray mode.
MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry was performed on a Bruker ultrafleXtreme
MALDI-ToF spectrometer; samples were prepared with dithranol as matrix
and sodium or potassium iodide as the ionization source. Elemental
analyses were performed by Stephen Boyer at London Metropolitan University.

Synthetic Procedures
Pro-ligands L1–L8 and complexes C1, C3, and C7 were prepared according to previously reported literature methods.48,53,71−73 Characterization

General Procedure
for Complexes C2, C4–C6, and C8
To a solution of pro-ligand (L1–L8) in THF solvent, 1.1 equiv of NaH was gradually
added and the mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 1 h.
A solution of anhydrous FeCl3 (0.5 equiv) in THF was added
dropwise to afford a dark colored mixture that was stirred for a further
16 h at room temperature. Solvents were evaporated in vacuo, and the
crude product was taken up in toluene solvent. The NaCl by-product
was removed by filtration through celite, and the filtrate was dried
in vacuo. The crude products were washed three times with hexane to
afford dark purple-brown powders. Single crystals suitable for X-ray
diffraction analysis were obtained via slow evaporation of DCM under
air. Structures of C5, C6, and C8 can be found under CCDC numbers 1868412–1868414.

General Procedure for the
R-ATRP of Styrene and MMA
In a glovebox, the complexes (C1–C8) (24.0 μmol),
monomer (100 equiv, 2.40 mmol), toluene (toluene/monomer, 1:1, v/v),
and initiator (AIBN or V-70) (0.6 equiv, 14.4 μmol) were sequentially
added to an airtight screwcap vial equipped with a magnetic stirrer
bar. The vial was removed from the glovebox and heated to 75 or 120
°C for 2 h. The vial was subsequently cooled to room temperature,
and an aliquot of the crude mixture was analyzed via 1H
NMR spectroscopy to determine the monomer conversion. The remainder
of the reaction mixture was quenched with chloroform (approximately
1 mL), and the polymer was purified by precipitation in acidified
methanol (MeOH/HCl(aq), approximately 75:1 mL). The polymer was isolated
by filtration and was subsequently dried in vacuo until constant weight
was achieved. Samples for GPC analysis were prepared in HPLC grade
THF and filtered through a 0.22 μm pore-sized syringe filter.

General Procedure for the ROP of rac-Lactide
In a glovebox, complexes (C1–C8) (10.0 μmol),
PO (50 equiv, 0.5 mmol), rac-lactide (100 equiv,
1.0 mmol), and toluene (1 mL) were added to an airtight screwcap vial
equipped with a magnetic stirrer bar. The vial was transferred to
the bench and heated to 120 °C in an oil bath for 24 h. The vial
was subsequently cooled to room temperature, the reaction mixture
was quenched with hexane, and an aliquot of the crude mixture was
analyzed via 1H NMR spectroscopy to determine monomer conversion.
The remainder of the reaction mixture was dissolved in chloroform
(approximately 1 mL), and the polymer was precipitated by the addition
of the solution to cold (0 °C) acidified methanol (MeOH/HCl(aq),
75:1 mL). The polymer was then isolated by filtration and dried in
vacuo until constant weight was achieved. Samples for GPC analysis
were prepared in HPLC grade THF solvent and filtered through a 0.20
μm pore sized syringe filter prior to analysis.

Crystallography
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data
were collected on an Rigaku Oxford diffraction SuperNova diffractometer
fitted with an Atlas CCD detector with Mo Kα radiation (λ
= 0.7107 Å) or Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å).
Crystals were mounted under Paratone on MiTeGen loops. The structures
were solved by direct methods using SHELXS or SHELXT and refined by
full-matrix least-squares on F2 using
SHELXL interfaced through Olex2.75,76 Molecular
graphics for all structures were generated using Diamond.
