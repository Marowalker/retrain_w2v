The formation of the sea urchin spicule
involves the stabilization
and transformation of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) and assembly
of ACC nanoparticle precursors into a mesoscale single crystal of
fracture-resistant calcite. This process of particle assembly or attachment
is under the control of a family of proteins known as the spicule
matrix [Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (SpSM)] proteome. Recently, two members of this proteome, SpSM50
and the glycoprotein SpSM30B/C-G (in recombinant forms), were found
to interact together via SpSM30B/C-G oligosaccharide–SpSM50
protein interactions to form hybrid protein hydrogels with unique
physical properties. In this study, we investigate the mineralization
properties of this hybrid hydrogel alongside the hydrogels formed
by SpSM50 and SpSM30B/C-G individually. We find that the SpSM50 +
SpSM30B/C-G hybrid hydrogel is synergistic with regard to surface
modifications and intracrystalline inclusions of existing calcite
crystals, the inhibition of ACC formation, and the kinetic destabilization
of ACC to form a crystalline phase. Most importantly, the hybrid hydrogel
phase assembles and organizes mineral particles into discrete clusters
or domains within in vitro mineralization environments. Thus, the
interactions of SpSM50 and SpSM30B/C-G, mediated by carbohydrate–protein
binding, reflect the need for protein cooperativity for the ACC-to-crystalline
transformation, intracrystalline void formation, and guided mineral
particle assembly processes that are instrumental in spicule formation.

==== Body
Introduction
The formation of mineralized
skeletal elements (spines, tests,
and spicules) in the sea urchin is an example of how mesoscale composite
materials1 can be formed from nanoparticle
assembly.2 This mineralization process
begins with the formation of an amorphous precursor phase, amorphous
calcium carbonate (ACC),3−7 and these amorphous nanoparticles aggregate together and eventually
transform into a crystalline phase, magnesium-substituted calcite
(MgC).3−9 This process of nanoparticle assembly is not known in detail,2 but it is suspected that the matrix proteins
which create the organic framework for mineralization play a key role
in this process10−14 because the deletion of some of these proteins is detrimental to
spicule mineralization.15 Another phenomenon
that occurs during skeletal element formation is the incorporation
of these matrix proteins into the mineral phase itself, resulting
in the formation of nanoinclusions that modulate the force resistance
of the skeletal structure.7−9,15−18 Thus, matrix proteins are a major driving force for the mineralization
process in the sea urchin and are responsible for the material properties
of skeletal structures for organism survival.

The formation
of the mineralized embryonic spicule in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus requires the expression
of several proteins that are designated as SpSM.10−24 Many expressed SpSM proteins are intrinsically disordered and feature
a globular C-type lectin-like domain at the N-terminal region,10−14 which participates in matrix assembly and mineralization.21 Furthermore, in 10 SpSM proteins, there is an
intrinsically disordered Met/Asn/Gln/Pro/Gly-rich redundant sequence
that is homologous to known elastomeric sequences.10−14 These common sequence elements may participate in
matrix formation and elasticity, mineral formation, or matrix–mineral
organization processes.

Of the known SM proteins, the best characterized
members are SpSM5010−18,24−28,30 and the SpSM30 acidic
glycoprotein A–F isoforms.10−20,22,23,26,28−30 Knockdown of SpSM30 expression does not interfere with spicule formation,
whereas knockdown of SpSM50 expression does.15 Reportedly, SpSM50 stabilizes hydrated ACC from transformation in
vitro.5,6 Recombinant model forms of both proteins25,26,28−30 (the insect
cell expressed glycosylated rSpSM30B/C-G, a hybrid of the “B”
and “C” isoform sequences; the bacteria expressed rSpSM50)
have been found to individually form protein hydrogel particles that
act as “smart” hydrogels25,29 that rapidly
exchange water,28 modify calcite crystals,25,29 and regulate the timeline and solubilities of ACC formation.25,29 Thus, the spicule matrix is a hydrogel environment formed by multiple
spicule matrix proteins, wherein ACC formation, stabilization, transformation,
and intracrystalline incorporation processes take place during spiculogenesis.

Recent combinatorial studies of rSpSM50 and rSpSM30B/C-G revealed
that rSpSM50 recognizes and binds to the anionic O-linked glycan moieties
located within the C-terminal region of rSpSM30B/C-G, yet does not
recognize or bind to the rSpSM30B/C-G protein sequence itself.30 These protein–glycan interactions lead
to the formation of a hybrid rSpSMB/C-G–rSpSM50 protein hydrogel
that is dimensionally and structurally different from the hydrogels
formed by the individual proteins.30 It
was postulated that rSpSM30B/C-G, which is not required for spicule
matrix formation,15 acts as a “helper”
protein which boosts or modulates the activity of the required rSpSM50
protein. However, these studies did not address the mineralization
activities of the hybrid rSpSM30B/C-G–rSpSM50 hydrogels and
thus were unable to shed light on what changes, if any, occur to the
mineralization process in the presence of this hybrid system.

To address this issue, we performed in vitro calcite mineralization
experiments involving four scenarios: protein-free, rSpSM30B/C-G,
rSpSM50, and 1:1 molar mixture of both proteins as utilized in our
earlier combinatorial protein hydrogel studies.30 Here, we examined the effect of each scenario on three
phenomena: (a) crystal growth; (b) nonclassical nucleation [i.e.,
the formation of prenucleation clusters (PNCs) and ACC clusters during
Ca2+ potentiometric titration];31−35 and (c) the organization and distribution of mineral
particles. Analogous to our findings with combinatorial nacre protein
studies,36−39 we discovered that the rSpSM30B/C-G + rSpSM50 hybrid protein hydrogel
creates synergistic mineralization effects on nucleation and crystal
growth. Specifically, existing crystals become highly modified by
surface nanotexturing and subsurface nanoporosities, and the formation
of crystalline CaCO3 from ACC is accelerated, that is,
the ACC phase is kinetically destabilized by the protein mixture.
More importantly, the hybrid hydrogel guides the assembly of mineral
particles into unique three-dimensional arrangements or domains not
seen for either protein. Thus, protein cooperativity is a requirement
for spicule mineral formation.

Experimental Section
Recombinant Protein Expression
and Purification
The
expression, preparation, and purification of the recombinant tag-free
insect cell-expressed SpSM30B/C-G glycoprotein (rSpSM30B/C-G)28,30 and bacteria-expressed SpSM50 (rSpSM50)25,30 were performed as described previously. The Sf9 insect-expressed
purified rSpSM30B/C-G protein sample contains three glycosylated protein
variants [molecular weight (MW) = 30 848.5, 33 287.4, and 37 157.2
Da] and a small percentage of unglycosylated protein (29 678.7 Da).28,30 For subsequent experimentation, protein samples were created by
exchanging and concentrating appropriate volumes of stock solution
into unbuffered deionized distilled water or other appropriate buffers
using Amicon Ultra 0.5 3 kDa MW cutoff concentration filters.25,28,30

In Vitro Micromineralization
Assays
Calcite-specific
mineralization microassays were conducted by mixing equal volumes
of 20 mM CaCl2·2H2O (pH 5.5) and 20 mM
NaHCO3/Na2CO3 buffer (pH 9.75) in
30 nm filtered ultrapure Molecular Biology-grade water (Fisher Scientific,
USA) to a final volume of 500 μL in sealed polypropylene tubes
and incubating at room temperature for 1 h.25,28,36−39 Individual aliquots of rSpSM30B/C-G
and rSpSM50 stock solutions were added to the calcium solution prior
to the beginning of the reaction, with final assay concentrations
of each protein of 10 μM. For scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
and micro-Raman analyses, mineral and protein deposits formed during
all assays were captured on 5 × 5 mm Si wafer chips (Ted Pella,
Inc.) that were placed at the bottoms of the vials. Upon completion
of the mineralization assay period, the Si wafers were rinsed thoroughly
with calcium carbonate-saturated methanol and dried overnight at room
temperature prior to analyses.26−30

SEM Imaging
SEM imaging of the Si wafers extracted
from the mineralization assays was performed using a Merlin (Carl
Zeiss) field emission scanning electron microscope using an Everhart–Thornley-type
secondary electron detector (SE2) at an accelerating voltage of 3
kV and a probe current of 100 pA. Prior to analysis, samples were
coated with iridium (4 nm layer) using a Cressington 208HR sputter
coater with a thickness controller.26−30

Micro-Raman Analyses
Micro-Raman
analysis of protein-deficient,
rSpSM30B/C-G, rSPSM50, and 1:1 rSpSM30B/C-G–rSpSM50 mineralization
assay samples (described in Experimental Section) on Si wafers were performed as described previously with a Thermo
Scientific DXR Raman microscope.26−30

Focused Ion Beam (FIB) Sectioning of Crystals
Imaging
of internal crystal morphology was performed on crystals retrieved
from 1:1 rSpSM30B/C-G–rSpSM50 assays using a Zeiss AURIGA small
dual-beam FIB–scanning electron microscope. Prior to imaging,
all samples were initially coated with a 4 nm iridium layer and then
coated with 50 nm of Au prior to performing FIB.25,29,36,37 A 30 kV 120
pA gallium ion beam was oriented perpendicular to the sample by tilting
the sample stage to 54° and subsequently utilized to mill 15
nm serial cross sections. SEM images of cross-sectioned surfaces were
then obtained.25,29,36,37 Images were taken shortly after cross-sectioning
to limit the exposure of the uncoated surfaces to the electron beam.25,29,36,37 Images of the surfaces containing electron-beam damage were created
for comparison with images of undamaged surfaces.

Calcium Potentiometric
Titrations
The quantitative
potentiometric titration experiments were conducted utilizing a computer-controlled
system (Metrohm), which is composed of two Titrando devices (Titrando
809) operating three dosing devices (800 Dosino) for CaCl2, NaOH, and HCl addition, respectively.25,29,35−39 During the course of titration, carbonate buffer
(10 mM, 20 mL) was titrated with slow addition of CaCl2 solution (10 mM) at a constant rate of 20 μL/min. Meanwhile,
the pH value was kept constant at pH 8.5 by automatic counter-titration
of NaOH (10 mM) and HCl (10 mM, diluted from 0.1 N), which were used
to balance the ion associations between Ca2+ ions and carbonate
species as well as the outgassing of CO2, respectively.
Simultaneously, a Ca(II) ion-selective electrode (Metrohm, no. 6.0508.110)
and a pH electrode (Metrohm, no. 6.0256.100) were used to monitor
the calcium potential and pH values, respectively, which were recorded
in the system and further used for extracting quantitative information
as discussed in detail elsewhere.35 The
quantitative potentiometric titrations were performed in the absence
and presence of rSpSM30B/C-G, rSpSM50 (50 and 500 nM), and the 1:1
molar mixture of both proteins in which 50 and 500 nM of each protein
were included; hence, for the 1:1 mixture, the protein concentrations
were 100 and 1000 nM, respectively.

Micro-Computerized X-ray
Tomography (CT) Studies
For
micro-CT (μCT) imaging and quantitation of mineral deposits,
we performed the same in vitro mineralization assays described in
the preceding section but utilized a final assay volume of 200 μL
and hinged-lid sealable plastic polypropylene lab microvials.26 Subsequently, four sample scenarios were created:
a control scenario (no protein was added), two protein scenarios using
individual aliquots of rSpSM50 and rSpSM30B/C-G stock solutions (final
protein concentrations = 1.5 μM), and a combinatorial scenario
using a 1:1 molar mixture of rSpSM50 + rSpSM30B/C-G (1.5 μM
each). At the end of 60 min, each mineralization assay vial was mounted
to the stage and scanned using Bruker micro-CT SkyScan high resolution
model 1172G (Bruker Scientific, Kontich, Belgium). The scanning process
involved a round scanning trajectory and step-and-shoot protocol,
with each image requiring 0.3°/step and 780 ms exposure time.26 Approximately 1300 images with a final resolution
of 4.99 μm per pixel were acquired for each sample over an 80
min period; thus, the total mineralization assay elapsed time was
140 min. For each sample, the sequence of images was processed as
described in our earlier μCT studies.26

Results and Discussion
rSpSM30B/C-G + rSpSM50 Alters Existing Crystal
Growth
In earlier investigations of individual25,26,29 and combined36−39 biomineralization proteins, we
used a calcite-based micromineralization assay protocol with a 60
min time interval that allows hydrogelation of the nacre proteins
to take place in tandem with mineral nucleation. As shown in Figure 1, SEM imaging of
mineral deposits that formed within individual rSpSM30B/C-G and rSpSM50
assays confirms the presence of calcite and reveals the typical crystal
morphological features noted in past studies of the individual proteins.25,29 The rSpSM30B/C-G protein hydrogel deposits onto forming calcite
crystals and promotes {104} faceted crystals that feature nanotextured
surfaces along their lengths (Figure 1).29 Presumably, facets
or flat surfaces appear because of some mineral surfaces nucleating
much more slowly relative to other surfaces.29 In contrast, rSpSM50 induces the formation of highly modified rhombohedral
calcite crystals that contain organized nanotexturing and evidence
of significant mineralized protein hydrogel adsorption (Figure 1).25 When the two spicule matrix proteins are present as a 1:1 molar
mixture, the resulting crystal morphologies are unique, with a loss
of rhombohedral morphology, introduction of extensive nanotexturing,
and significant mineralized protein hydrogel deposition (Figure 1, white arrows).38,39 There is also a detectable level of vaterite crystals that form
in the rSpSM30B/C-G, rSpSM50, and 1:1 mineralization assays (Figure
S1, Supporting Information). Because our
assays do not include Mg(II), we can neither comment on the potential
formation of MgC in the presence of either protein nor on the impact
that Mg(II) has on protein hydrogelation, which is considerable.39 Nonetheless, the combination of the two SpSM
proteins is calcite inhibitory and generates unique effects on crystal
surfaces not seen with the individual proteins themselves.25,29

assays. 1:1 refers to the equimolar rSpSM30B/C-G–rSpSM50 mixture.
Mineralized protein deposits are indicated by white arrows. Protein-free
control image is shown as an inset to the rSpSM30B/C-G image (where
scale bar = 2 μm). Note that vaterite crystals are also observed
in both the rSpSM30B/C-G and rSpSM50 mineralization assays (Figure
S1, Supporting Information).

Given that both rSpSM30B/C-G and rSpSM50 protein
hydrogels deposit
onto forming calcite crystals and create numerous intracrystalline
nanoporosities relative to the calcite generated in protein-free conditions,25,29 we performed FIB sectioning of calcite crystals generated in 1:1
mixture assays (Figure 2; Supporting Information, Figure S2).
As expected, the hybrid hydrogels that form from both proteins are
incorporated into growing crystals via repetitive hydrogel deposition,25,29,36−38 thereby creating
numerous intracrystalline nanoporosities that create a “woven”
appearance throughout the crystal interior, unlike the large, centrally
located nanochambers created by rSpSM5025 and rSpSM30B/C-G.29 The intracrystalline
incorporation of rSpSM50 + rSpSM30B/C-G correlates with the intracrystalline
detection of spicule matrix proteins during spiculogenesis,7−9,16 which induces elastic deformation
to the single-crystal calcite of this skeletal element.7−9

In contrast, the calcite generated in protein (−) conditions
features few, if any, intracrystalline nanoporosities.25,29,38−40

Selective Synergistic Effects of 1:1 rSpSM30B/C-G–rSpSM50
on Nonclassical Nucleation
Having assessed the impact of
the 1:1 hybrid spicule matrix protein hydrogel on existing calcium
carbonate crystal growth, we next examined the influence of rSpSM50,
rSpSM30B/C-G, and 1:1 rSpSM30B/C-G–rSpSM50 on the nonclassical
CaCO3 nucleation of ACC at pH 8.5, which was explored by
means of quantitative potentiometric titrations (Figure 3; Table 1; Figure S3, Supporting Information).31−39 These experiments examine the formation of PNCs, the direct molecular
precursors to phase-separated nanodroplets that assemble and dehydrate
into ACC particles in solution upon nucleation.35 Previously, we have studied rSpSM30B/C-G and rSpSM50 separately
using potentiometric methods at different pH regimes;25,29 in this current study, we revisit these two proteins again, this
time at pH 8.5, using larger volumes (20 mL) to further minimize dilution
effects.25,29

c The solubilities
of initially formed
phases are between that of monohydrocalcite40 and vaterite41 corresponding to 2.51
× 10–8 and 1.22 × 10–8, respectively.

In the
prenucleation regime, the slope of free Ca2+ development
represents the stability of the PNCs.31,32 For rSpSM30B/C-G,
rSpSM50, and 1:1 mixture titrations, there is insignificant change
in the prenucleation gradient in comparison with the reference titration
curve, indicating that the individual and combined proteins do not
interfere with the formation equilibria of solute ion clusters at
all tested concentrations (Table 1; Figures 3A and S3A, Supporting Information).25,29,31,32 This implies that rSpSM30B/C-G, rSpSM50, and the
1:1 mixture have no effect on the thermodynamic stability of PNCs.

However, a different story emerges for the nucleation timeline.
The nucleation of solid calcium carbonate is signified by the steep
decrease in free Ca2+ (Figure 3A) and ion product (Figure 3B). In the presence of 50 nM rSpSM30B/C-G,
rSpSM50, and the 1:1 mixture, the nucleation event is slightly delayed,
corresponding to nearly equivalent scaling factors33 of 1.15, 1.07, and 1.23, respectively (Table 1). At 500 nM, the inhibition
of the nucleation event increases slightly, corresponding to scaling
factors of 1.48, 1.50, and 1.61, respectively (Table 1). Thus, the combination of the two proteins
is slightly inhibitory for the formation of solid mineral precursors.

We also witness a synergistic effect on ACC solubility and stability,
which is highly relevant for spiculogenesis.3−7 After the nucleation of solid calcium carbonate,
the amount of free calcium ions drops to a threshold, representing
the solubility product of initially formed phases (Figures 3B and S3B, Supporting Information), which is typically proto-calcite
ACC (pc-ACC)34 at pH 8.5. In the presence
of 50 nM rSpSM50, there is no obvious change in the solubility of
initially formed phases relative to the reference experiments within
experimental accuracy (Figure S3B, Supporting Information). At 500 nM, the solubility of initially precipitated
phases is slightly lower than the reference scenario (Figure 3B and Table 1), which is consistent with previous results.25 In contrast, the influence of rSpSM30B/C-G in
promoting the formation of less soluble phases is significantly more
pronounced, and based upon the solubilities (Table 1), we are witnessing the accelerated formation
of either monohydrocalcite (which may be very transient and difficult
to detect experimentally)40 or vaterite41 (Figure 3B, Table 1; Figure S3B, Supporting Information), which explains why vaterite is observed
in rSpSM30B/C-G assays.29 However, when
compared to the individual proteins (50 nM or 500 nM), the solubility
threshold of less soluble phases is reached even faster in the 1:1
scenario, especially at 500 nM (i.e., the gradient of the drop in
the free calcium or ion product observed upon nucleation is steeper
than in the other cases; Figure 3B; Figure S3B, Supporting Information). This indicates that the combination of rSpSM50 and rSpSM30B/C-G
synergistically drives the formation of thermodynamically more stable
crystalline phases from ACC.

To summarize, rSpSMs, either individually
or in combination, do
not affect the PNC equilibria at the investigated concentrations.
However, rSpSM30B/C-G and the 1:1 mixture exhibit slight inhibitory
effects on the nucleation event (Figure 3A), and the initially precipitated phases
are thermodynamically more stable than in the reference experiments
(Figure 3B and Table 1). Note also that
for the 1:1 mixture titrations, the solubility threshold of more stable
phases is established faster. From this, we conclude that there is
synergy between rSpSM30B/C-G and rSpSM50 within the hybrid hydrogels,
which accelerates the formation of crystalline CaCO3 from
ACC. We speculate that the ACC phase is kinetically destabilized by
the hybrid protein hydrogels, but further experimentation would be
needed to confirm this. If this mechanism is correct, then it would
be highly relevant for the spicule mineralization process, given that
ACC to calcite transformation is somehow triggered during spiculogenesis.3−6 This process may be facilitated by the ability of each spicule matrix
protein to form hydrogels that regulate water binding,28 thereby controlling the hydration—dehydration
events that occur with ACC prior to calcite formation.

Hybrid 1:1
rSpSM30B/C-G–rSpSM50 Hydrogel Creates a Unique
Distribution of Mineral Particles
In previous studies of
biomineralization protein hydrogels, we utilized μCT imaging
to noninvasively detect and analyze X-ray attenuating calcium carbonate
mineral particles (5 μm or greater in size) and distinguish
the quantity, distribution, and organization of mineral particles
within a protein hydrogel environment or protein-free scenario.26 The hydrogels themselves possess scarce X-ray
attenuation properties, and thus because of low imaging contrast,
they will not be directly detected by μCT. As shown in Figure 4, the transverse
(XY-plane) and sagittal (XZ-plane)
imaging planes reveal distinctive differences between both spicule
matrix proteins and the protein-free control assays. First, the obvious
difference is the number of mineral particles generated within the
three scenarios, with rSpSM50 generating the largest number (by ∼2×)
and rSpSM30B/C-G the smallest number (∼1.4×) relative
to (−) protein conditions (Figure 4, top row). Second, in the sagittal views
(Figure 4, bottom row),
one can clearly see that both spicule matrix proteins create stratified
mineralized phases at the bottom of the vials compared to the control
scenario, with rSpSM50 generating the highest degree of stratification
compared to either rSpSM30B/C-G or the negative control scenario.
As stated in our earlier μCT studies,26 we believe that this stratification phenomenon is protein-specific.

the presence of mineral particle layering. Scale bar = 1 mm; height
of each image = 1.9 mm. Orientation axes shown. Note in all images
the hemispherical region, which is the remnant plastic sprue stub
that remains from the vial manufacturing process.26

Now, when we examine the μCT
results obtained for the 1:1
rSpSM30B/C-G–rSpSM50 hybrid hydrogel mineralization assay (Figure 5), we find some surprising
results: (1) There are fewer mineral particles generated in the 1:1
assay system compared to all other scenarios, that is, we observe
a 2.2×, 5×, and 1.6× reduction compared to the control,
rSpSM50, and rSpSM30B/C-G samples, respectively. (2) The distribution
of mineral particles is completely different, with the 1:1 rSpSM30B/C-G–rSpSM50
hydrogel system arranging or guiding the mineral particles into discrete
clusters, compartments, or domains (∼30 in number) as viewed
in the transverse plane with very few examples of individual mineral
particles noted outside these domains. This can also be seen in a
three-dimensional tilt view of this sample (Figure S4, Supporting Information). In some locations, the
mineral clusters appear linear or very dense (Figure 5, white arrows). We believe that the clustering
effect is evidence of a protein-guided mineral assembly or compartmentalization
process similar to what has been documented for mollusk shell nacre
proteins.42,43 In the sagittal XZ plane,
we note that a significant number of clustered mineral particles appear
suspended above the vial bottom as if embedded within a supporting
matrix. From these results, we conclude the following regarding the
1:1 rSpSM30B/C-G–rSpSM50 hybrid hydrogel mixture: (1) similar
to our potentiometric findings (Figure 3), the 1:1 mixture limits the calcite crystal growth
to a greater degree than either rSpSM50 or rSpSM30B/C-G (Figures 4 and 5), indicating that rSpSM30B/C-G–rSpSM50 interactions
attenuate nucleation and the formation of calcite crystals; (2) the
hybrid hydrogel environment assembles and organizes mineral particles
into unique three-dimensional clusters, compartments, or domains.
This in vitro particle-guided assembly process correlates with the
in situ observations that the mesoscale single-crystal calcite in
the spicule is assembled from the precursor mineral particles.3−7

Conclusions
The formation of matrix
protein hydrogels and their influence on
calcium carbonate nucleation, crystal growth, and mineral particle
assembly and organization have emerged as fundamental phenomena that
explain the role of these proteins within the biomineralization process
of invertebrate skeletal elements such as the sea urchin spicule25,26,28−30 and the mollusk
shell nacre layer.36−39 In this report, we uncover additional evidence which supports these
past observations and gain further insights into the potential roles
that SpSM50 and SpSM30 play together in the sea urchin embryonic spiculogenesis.
Previously, we documented the high-affinity Ca(II)-independent interaction
between the O-linked oligosaccharide moieties of the glycoprotein,
SpSM30B/C-G, and the major spicule matrix protein, SpSM50, which lead
to the formation of a hybrid protein hydrogel.30 Our present data reveal that this hybrid hydrogel functions
differently from the individual hydrogels generated by either rSpSM30B/C-G
or rSpSM50 (Figures 1–2345), suggesting that there
are cooperative and synergistic mineralization effects36−39—on both the early and later stages of crystal growth—when
both proteins are present.

Specifically, the hybrid hydrogel
deposits onto forming calcite
crystals and obliterates the rhombohedral morphology, increases the
degree of surface nanotexturing (Figure 1), and generates woven-appearance intracrystalline
nanoporosities (Figure 2). During the early stages of nucleation, rSpSM30B/C-G + rSpSM50
slightly increases the time interval for ACC formation (Figure 3A, Table 1; Figure S3A, Supporting Information), thereby limiting crystal formation (Figure 5). Furthermore, the
1:1 mixture establishes the solubility threshold of more stable phases
faster, and we believe that the protein mixture kinetically destabilizes
ACC to rapidly form crystalline phases (Figure 3B, Table 1; Figure S3B, Supporting Information). Given that ACC exists in hydrated and dehydrated forms during
spiculogenesis and transforms into calcite4−6 and that there
is an organic layer detected around ACC,7 we hypothesize that hybrid SpSM50–SpSM30B/C-G hydrogels could
influence ACC hydration/dehydration via hydrogel binding and release
of water over time.28 Interestingly, SpSM50
alone has been reported to stabilize ACC in vitro,5 and thus, the combination of rSpSM50 + rSpSM30B/C-G alters
rSpSM50 function from the stabilizer to the transformer. Once the
ACC-to-calcite transformation process takes place (Figure 3), the hybrid hydrogel phases
eventually become incorporated into the calcite mineral phase (Figure 2), thereby creating
a nanoporous, fracture-resistant mineralized skeletal element.7−9 Further in situ research will be required to establish these protein-directed
processes within the spicule during development.

Perhaps the
most compelling result from our study is the ability
of the hybrid SpSM50–SpSM30B/C-G hydrogel to initiate guided
assembly of mineral particles into organized clusters, compartments,
or domains (Figure 5). As mentioned in the previous section, assembled ACC nanoparticles
within the spicule matrix transform and constitute the mesocrystalline
phase of calcite and these nanoparticles are coated with an organic
matrix.7 In earlier scanning transmission
electron microscopy flow-cell studies with the nacre-associated mollusk
shell protein, we demonstrated the ability of a biomineralization
protein to assemble mineral particles via hydrogel–hydrogel
particle assembly.42 Hence, the SpSM protein
family is a likely agent in mineral nanoparticle assembly and mesoscale
organizational process, and our current study supports this hypothesis
by demonstrating these capabilities in vitro (Figure 5). To some degree, this mineral particle
assembly process could be accomplished by SpSM50 alone and to a minor
extent, SpSM30B/C-G, as indicated by the presence of mineral layering
(Figure 4),26 but this process becomes accentuated and more
sophisticated when SpSM30B/C-G interacts noncovalently with SpSM50
(Figure 5; Figure S4, Supporting Information). At this juncture, we
do not fully understand how the interactions of SpSM30B/C-G with SpSM50
facilitate mineral particle assembly and organization. On the basis
of past nacre protein hydrogel particle assembly studies,42,43 it is possible that carbohydrate–protein interactions between
the two spicule matrix proteins enable mineral-containing protein
hydrogel particles to coassemble, thus bringing the mineral particles
together to form a mesoscale crystal.42,43 Thus, the
spicule matrix proteins of the sea urchin probably function in a similar
fashion vis-a-vis mineral nanoparticle formation and assembly. It
would be interesting to learn if other calcium carbonate—associated
proteomes function in a similar fashion and we hope that future research
will establish this.

Finally, we believe that our study clarifies
the importance of
protein–protein interactions and cooperativity in spiculogenesis.
As mentioned previously, knockdown experiments established that SpSM50,
and not SpSM30, is essential for spiculogenesis.15 Yet, immunolocalization experiments clearly demonstrate
that SpSM30 appears in the spicule matrix during development and is
mineral-associated.16,19,20 On the basis of our research, we believe that SpSM30 isoforms do
not function independently but are interactive with SpSM50 in situ
and cooperatively form hydrogel-like phases with modified functionalities
that enable ACC-to-calcite transformation and guided particle assembly
or compartmentalization. Thus, we believe that the minor proteins
of the spicule matrix, such as SpSM30,11−16 act as “helpers” or “agents” that influence
or “tune” the function of the major SpSM50 spicule matrix
protein and its impact on nucleation, stabilization, assembly, and
mineral organization in a temporal and/or regional fashion. Obviously,
in situ protein localization studies as a function of developmental
time and gene expression will be necessary to establish or refute
this hypothesis.
