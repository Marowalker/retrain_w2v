In our previous study, we developed a genome-wide DNA
methylation
model for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, and we pointed out that
a considerable average error is associated with the current method
for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, which is predicated on pathological
assessment of biopsied tissue. In this study, we utilized whole exome
and transcriptome RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data that were derived
from 468 tumor samples and 51 normal samples of prostatic tissue,
and we analyzed over 20,000 genes per sample. We were able to develop
a mathematical model that classified tumor tissue versus normal tissue
with a high accuracy. The overall sensitivity was 97.01%, and the
overall specificity was 94.12%. The input variables to the model were
the mRNA expression values of the following nine genes: ANGPT1, MED21, AOX1, PLP2, HPN, HPN-AS1, EPHA10, NKX2-3, and LRFN1. The model
was validated with unknown samples, with a 10-fold cross-validation,
and a leave-one-out cross-validation. We present here a genomic model,
based on a whole exome and transcriptome RNA-seq analysis of biopsied
prostatic tissue, that could be utilized in the diagnosis of prostate
cancer.

1 Introduction
1.1 Prostate Cancer
In our previous study,1 we pointed out that the current diagnosis of
prostate cancer, based on pathological analysis of biopsied tissue,
is associated with an average error of 25–30% in connection
with underdetection and an average error of 1.3–7.1% in connection
with overdetection.2,3 In some cases, the underdetection
error is substantially higher.4 In addition,
the error of a Gleason score—a pathological assessment scale
used for grading biopsied prostate tumors—is estimated to be
39%.5 Those sources of error associated
with the current method of prostate cancer diagnosis most likely stem
from the fact that pathological assessment of tissue does not have
the necessary resolution to detect—much less assess and monitor—those
molecular processes, such as gene expression alterations, which initiate
tumorigenesis and drive its early evolution and which occur at the
molecular level. Furthermore, those molecular processes that initiate
tumorigenesis and drive its early evolution begin to perturb a host
of other molecular processes and mechanisms, such as DNA methylation
and other gene expression alterations, years before cancer diagnosis,6 that is to say, years before cancer manifests
itself at the tissue level.

1.2 Gene Expression and Cancer
Gene expression,
the most fundamental cellular process, is driven by the nature and
the state of cells and, equally importantly, by the environment in
which they find themselves. That means that cell function and survival
are the most dominant determinants of gene expression. Transcriptomics,
the study of gene expression that relies on measurement of RNA molecules,
is the most powerful and the most well-established method of assessing
and monitoring the biology of cells.7 Moreover,
transcriptomics affords the most expeditious means of observing changes
imposed onto cells by their state or their environment. In the case
of tumor cells, gene expression, like many other cellular processes,
is appropriated, and it is used to activate or overexpress genes that
are vital or beneficial to them and to suppress or silence genes that
are detrimental to their survival. Following the advent of next-generation
sequencing technologies, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), with its unprecedented
accuracy and sensitivity, quickly became the dominant technology for
gene expression measurements.8 In addition
to accuracy, sensitivity, and high resolution at the molecular level,
RNA-seq revolutionized the entire field of transcriptomics by vastly
expanding it so that whole exome and transcriptome sequencing, alternative
splicing, RNA editing, fusion transcripts, allele-specific expression,
post-transcriptional modifications, and many noncoding RNAs became
essential components of it.7,9 As a result, cancer
transcriptome profiling has started being introduced into the clinic
to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.7

1.3 Hypothesis
The hypothesis of this
study is that tumor cells have induced significant alterations in
the gene expression of a number of genes and that, as a result of
this, the transcriptomic profile of the tumor cells is significantly
different from that of the normal cells.

1.4 Overview of the Model
We developed
a multivariable function, whose nine input variables were the mRNA
expression values of the following nine genes: ANGPT1, MED21, AOX1, PLP2, HPN, HPN-AS1, EPHA10, NKX2-3, and LRFN1. The model,
this multivariable function, was developed during the training phase
using approximately 70% of all available samples (328 tumor samples
and 36 normal samples), and it was based on the transcriptomic analysis
of over 20,000 genes per sample. After its development, the model
was first validated with unknown samples [approximately 30% of all
available samples (140 tumor samples and 15 normal samples)], which
had been randomly preallocated at the beginning of the study and used
only for testing purposes. Following its validation with unknown samples,
the model was further tested with a 10-fold cross-validation and a
leave-one-out cross-validation. The overall performance of the model,
including the training and validation phases, was sensitivity = (454/468)
= 97.01% and specificity = (48/51) = 94.12%.

2 Methods
2.1 Data
The data used in this study
were the normalized data obtained from 468 prostatic tumor tissue
samples and 51 normal prostatic tissue samples, generated from whole
exome and transcriptome RNA-seq analysis of tissue using the Illumina
HiSeq 2000 sequencer and downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas of
the National Cancer Institute under the category PRAD.

2.2 Clinical Methods
All clinical methods
used in this study were the same as the ones we employed in our previous
study.1 Briefly, all tumor samples used
in this study were primary tumors and had been obtained from subjects
that did not have a history of prior and/or other malignancy. The
Gleason scores of all 468 tumor samples ranged from 6 to 10 (Table S1).

2.3 Statistical Methods
The statistical
methods used in this study were the same as the ones we used in our
previous study and are presented in great detail there.1 Briefly, using only the data from the training
set, a transcriptomic analysis was performed. Taking into account
that the total number of variables (transcripts) per sample was 20,531
and utilizing the Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, the statistical
significance level for the transcriptomic analysis was set at α
= (0.05/20,531) = 2.43 × 10–6 (two-tailed).
Therefore, in order for any variable to be deemed statistically significant,
it must have a P value of < 2.43 × 10–6.

2.4 Development of the Model
A random
sample selection was performed to generate the training and validation
sets so that the training set comprised approximately 70% of the total
number of samples from each group and the validation set comprised
the remaining approximately 30% of the samples. Furthermore, in accordance
with the same methods as in our previous study,1 the random selection of the tumor samples was modified
in order for the training set to comprise approximately 70% of the
tumor samples with a particular Gleason score and in order for the
validation set to comprise approximately 30% of the tumor samples
with a particular Gleason score (Tables S2 and S3).

Of the 20,531 variables (transcripts) assessed during
the transcriptomic analysis using the data from the training set,
4484 met the above-mentioned criterion of significance and provided
the variable pool for the development of the model. Employing the
same methodology as in our previous studies,1,10−13 we were able to develop the following multivariable function (eq 1). Equation 1 exhibited the best performance in terms of
sensitivity and specificity in the training phase and was selected
for validation. 1  In eq 1, X1 represents
the mRNA expression value of the gene ANGPT1, X2 the gene MED21, X3 the gene AOX1, X4 the gene PLP2, X5 the gene HPN, X6 the
gene HPN-AS1, X7 the
gene EPHA10, X8 the gene NKX2-3, and X9 the gene LRFN1.

Since X1 to X9 are the respective mRNA expression values
of the aforementioned
nine genes and since, theoretically, mRNA expression values belong
in the continuous interval [0, +∞), the theoretical domain
of F (eq 1) is the interval [0, +∞). Moreover, since X5, X6, X7, X8, and X9 are all ≥0, the function F is continuous
and is defined throughout its domain [0, +∞). From eq 1, it can be seen that F attains its minimum value when X1 = X2 = X3 = X4 = 0 and when, concomitantly, X5, X6, X7, X8, and X9 are very large. In this case, F →
0. Conversely, when X1, X2, X3, and X4 are very large and when, concomitantly, X5 = X6 = X7 = X8 = X9 = 0, F attains its maximum value. In
this case, F → +∞. Therefore, the theoretical
range of F is the interval (0, +∞). In practice,
however, a very large value of mRNA expression may be in the order
of 106. In fact, the largest expression value observed
in this study was 6.9 × 106. Assuming, therefore,
a very large expression value to be 107, we can observe
the behavior of F in the two aforementioned extreme
cases. In the case where X1 = X2 = X3 = X4 = 0 and X5 = X6 = X7 = X8 = X9 = 107, Fmin = 0.047, which is close
to zero, the theoretical absolute minimum value to which F approaches. In the case where X1 = X2 = X3 = X4 = 107 and X5 = X6 = X7 = X8 = X9 = 0, Fmax = 6259.289. The transcriptomic
analysis revealed that in the case of tumor cells, X1 to X4 were significantly
underexpressed, whereas X5 to X9 were significantly overexpressed as compared
with normal cells (Table 1). In view of this finding, the Fmin represents theoretically the worst possible transcriptomic state
in which tumor cells could be. From a biological perspective, that
makes sense because in that case, X1 to X4 are completely suppressed, while X5 to X9 are completely upregulated,
and this transcriptomic state is the farthest from the normal one.
Conversely, the Fmax represents theoretically
the most extreme transcriptomic state in which normal cells could
be: X1 to X4 are completely upregulated, while X5 to X9 are completely suppressed, a state
that is the farthest from that of the tumor cells. The observed range
of F, based on all 519 samples of this study, was
[4.251, 44.127] (Table S1).

Using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
analysis
on the results of the F function in the training
phase and taking into account the respective variances of the two
groups (T vs N), the cut-off point (COP) that demarcates a score of
a tumor sample from that of a normal sample was determined to be COP
= 23.162. An F score less than the COP designates
a tumor sample, whereas an F score greater than or
equal to the COP designates a normal sample. Using an ROC curve analysis
in a future clinical trial validation study, the COP can be adjusted
to optimize the performance of the model.

3 Results
3.1 Transcriptomic Analysis
The transcriptomic
results in connection with the nine input variables of the model based
on the data of the training set appear in Table 1. The variable name, the gene symbol, the
NCBI gene ID, the mean mRNA expression value (MT) of the T (tumor) group with its standard deviation (SDT), the mean mRNA expression value (MN) of the N (normal) group with its standard deviation (SDN), the fold change (FC) (representing the mRNA expression
change in the tumor cells as compared with that in the normal cells),
and the probability of significance (P) for all nine
variables are listed.

3.2 Training
In the training phase, the
model (eq 1) identified
correctly 316/328 tumor samples and 34/36 normal samples (Table S2). Therefore, the sensitivity was 96.34%,
and the specificity was 94.44%. The ROC area-under-the-curve (AUC)
statistics were as follows: AUC = 0.98044, its standard error was
AUC SE = 0.00718, z-value = 66.94, and the 95% confidence
interval of the AUC value was [0.95998, 0.99049] (Figure 1A). The T group had a mean F score and standard deviation of FT = 13.0445 ± 4.9146, and its median value was 12.4581.
Based on 100,000 Monte Carlo and bootstrap simulations, the 99% confidence
interval of the FT was determined to be
[12.3270, 13.7350]. The N group had a mean F score
and standard deviation of FN = 28.7701
± 5.1239, and its median value was 29.3081. Similarly, based
on 100,000 Monte Carlo and bootstrap simulations, the 99% confidence
interval of the FN was determined to be
[26.5718, 30.9196]. The Mann–Whitney U test
statistics were as follows: UT = 231, UN = 11,577, z-value = 9.4652,
and the approximate probability of significance with correction was P = 2.93 × 10–21 (Figure 2A,B).

3.3 Validation with Unknown Samples
In
the validation phase, using the 155 preallocated unknown samples (140
tumor and 15 normal samples), the model (eq 1) identified correctly 138/140 tumor samples
and 14/15 normal samples (Table S3). Therefore,
the sensitivity was 98.57%, and the specificity was 93.33%. The unknown
T samples had a mean F score and standard deviation
of FT = 13.4263 ± 4.2591, and their
median value was 12.8706. The unknown N samples had a mean F score and standard deviation of FN = 30.2478 ± 7.2911, and their median value was 30.5702.
The Welch unequal-variance t-test statistics for
the two groups of unknown samples in connection with their F scores were as follows: t = 8.7764, degrees
of freedom = 15.04, and the probability of significance was P = 2.65 × 10–07.

3.4 Overall Performance
When we pooled
together the 364 samples (328 tumor and 36 normal) from the training
phase with the 155 unknown samples (140 tumor and 15 normal) from
the validation phase, the model’s overall performance was as
follows: sensitivity = (454/468) = 97.01% and specificity = (48/51)
= 94.12% (Figure 3 and Table S1). The ROC AUC statistics were as follows:
AUC = 0.97796, its standard error was AUC SE = 0.00901, z-value = 53.06, and the 95% confidence interval of the AUC value
was [0.95113, 0.99014] (Figure 1B). The T group had a mean F score and standard
deviation of FT = 13.1587 ± 4.7268,
and its median value was 12.5619. Based on 100,000 Monte Carlo and
bootstrap simulations, the 99% confidence interval of the FT was calculated to be [12.5949, 13.7157]. The
N group had a mean F score and standard deviation
of FN = 29.2047 ± 5.8073, and its
median value was 29.3748. Similarly, based on 100,000 Monte Carlo
and bootstrap simulations, the 99% confidence interval of the FN was calculated to be [27.1356, 31.2805]. The
Mann–Whitney U test statistics were as follows: UT = 526, UN = 23,342, z-value = 11.2169, and the approximate probability of significance
with correction was P = 3.37 × 10–29. The range of all 519 F scores was [4.251, 44.217]
(Figure 4A,B). Table 2 shows the mRNA expression
results of the nine input variables of the model based on the combined
data of the training and validation sets. The variable name, the gene
symbol, the NCBI gene ID, the mean mRNA expression value (MT) of the T (tumor) group with its standard
deviation (SDT), the mean mRNA expression value (MN) of the N (normal) group with its standard
deviation (SDN), the FC, and the probability of significance
(P) for all nine variables are listed.

an F score less than the COP signifies a tumor sample,
whereas an F score greater than or equal to the COP
signifies a normal sample. Therefore, the blue transparent plane represents
the cut-off plane in the 3D space of all 519 samples.

3.5 Cross-Validations
The 10-fold cross-validation
yielded a misclassification rate of 5.59% (29/519) and a mean-squared
error of 0.0559. The sensitivity was 94.44%, and the specificity was
94.12%. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) was 0.7540. The
training and testing sets for each of the 10 rounds, as well as the
confusion matrix and other statistical information, appear in Table S4. Similarly, the leave-one-out cross-validation
yielded a misclassification rate of 5.59% (29/519) and a mean-squared
error of 0.0559. The sensitivity was 94.44%, the specificity was 94.12%,
and the MCC was 0.7540. The results of all 519 rounds, as well as
the confusion matrix and other statistical information, appear in Table S5.

4 Discussion
In this study, using whole
exome and transcriptome RNA-seq, we
developed and presented a genomic model that could be utilized in
the diagnosis of prostate cancer. A subsequent clinical validation
with a larger, multicenter retrospective study would constitute the
next step for this model and would advance its application closer
to the clinic. Such a multicenter study would be able to minimize
the innate error of the current diagnostic method (reliance on morphology,
that is, visual inspection of the tissue) to classify samples, and
it would also provide more information about the few statistical outliers
in this study. For example, in the T group, there were eight samples
with the highest F scores for that group (from 26.323
to 31.580) (Figures 3 and 4A and Table S1), ranging from 2.79 to 3.90 standard deviations above the mean value
of that group. All of those eight samples were determined to be statistical
outliers, and they were misclassified by the model. If they were to
be removed from the study as extreme outliers, then the performance
of the model would increase considerably [sensitivity = (462/468)
= 98.72%]. We should point out here that seven of those eight statistical
outliers were also misclassified by the DNA methylation model in our
previous study.1 This provides independent
evidence and raises questions about the actual nature of those seven
samples, all of which were determined to be tumor samples by the pathology
report. From the different perspectives of two different molecular
analyses (gene expression and DNA methylation), those seven samples
should be classified in the heart of the N group. Furthermore, in
the N group, there were three samples with the lowest F scores for that group (19.352, 17.211, and 13.886) (Figures 3 and 4A and Table S1), being 1.70, 2.07, and
2.64 standard deviations below the mean value of that group, respectively.
Those samples constituted the only three misclassifications of the
model with respect to the N group (Table S1). Interestingly, two out of those three samples, the ones with the
two lowest F scores (17.211 and 13.886), were also
misclassified by the DNA methylation model in our previous study.1 This suggests that those two samples, which were
deemed normal by the pathology report, should be classified as tumor
samples according to both the gene expression analysis and the DNA
methylation analysis. The results of this study, as well as those
of the previous one,1 demonstrate the capability
of genomic methods and modeling to improve current cancer diagnosis.
Furthermore, genomic methods and modeling, based on molecular analyses,
can be used to improve cancer prognosis as well; genomic models can
be developed and trained to detect a characteristic signature of the
most aggressive tumor cells and to make accurate predictions about
the survival of patients and about the future course of the disease.12,13

According to the results of our transcriptomic analysis (Tables 1 and 2), the genes ANGPT1, MED21, AOX1, and PLP2 (variables X1 to X4) were significantly
suppressed in the tumor cells compared with normal cells. Suppression
of ANGPT1 has been observed to correlate with progression
and metastasis of prostate cancer, as well as with patients’
reduced relapse-free survival.14 Suppression
of AOX1 has been observed in prostate cancer and
has been associated with reduced patients’ survival and disease
recurrence.15 Our transcriptomic analysis
(Tables 1 and 2) further revealed that the genes HPN, HPN-AS1, EPHA10, NKX2-3, and LRFN1 (variables X5 to X9) were significantly upregulated
in the tumor cells compared with normal cells. A number of studies
have descried that HPN is an oncogene, the overexpression
of which promotes tumorigenesis and invasiveness of tumor cells in
various different types of cancer,16,17 particularly
prostate cancer.18EPHA10 has been found to be overexpressed in breast, colon, and prostate
cancers,19 and its overexpression has been
associated with stage progression and metastasis of tumor cells in
breast cancer.20 Overexpression of the
homeobox gene NKX2-3 has been linked to tumorigenesis
in marginal-zone B-cell lymphomas.21 Finally, LRFN1 has been reported to be overexpressed in prostate
cancer,22 and its suppression has been
observed to decrease cell viability and survival of pancreatic tumor
cells.23
