The aim of this study is to develop
efficient enzyme immobilization
media that will enable the reuse of the biocatalysts over multiple
cycles, increase their thermal stability, and attenuate their activity
toward hydrophobic substrates for “green” transformations
in aqueous media. For this purpose, amphiphilic AB and ABA block copolymers
were synthesized and tested with laccase (a multicopper oxidase).
In all cases, the hydrophilic B block consisted of poly(ethylene glycol),
PEG, with molecular masses of 3, 5, 13, 20, or 13 kDa poly(ethylene
oxide). The hydrophobic A blocks were made of linear poly(styrene),
PS; hyperbranched poly(p-chloromethyl styrene); or
dendritic poly(benzyl ether)s of generations 2, 3, and 4 (G2, G3,
and G4) with molecular masses ranging from 1 to 24 kDa. A total of
23 different copolymers (self-assembling into micelles or physical
networks) were evaluated. Notable activity enhancements were achieved
with both micelles (up to 253%) and hydrogels (up to 408%). The highest
enzymatic activity and thermal stability were observed with laccase
immobilized in hydrogels consisting of the linear ABA block copolymer
PS2.7k–PEG3k–PS2.7k (13 290 μkat/L, 65
°C, ABTS test). This represents a 1245% improvement over native
laccase at the same conditions. At 25 °C, the same complex showed
a 1236% higher activity than the enzyme. The highest polymerization
yield for a water-insoluble monomer was achieved with laccase immobilized
in hydrogels composed of linear–dendritic ABA copolymer G3–PEG5k–G3
(85.5%, 45 °C, tyrosine monomer). The broad substrate specificity
and reusability of the immobilized laccase were also demonstrated
by the successful discoloration of bromophenol blue, methyl orange,
and rhodamine B over eight repetitive cycles.

1 Introduction
The
implementation of enzymes in synthetic chemistry is often viewed
as very lucrative because of their high catalytic activity, substrate
specificity, stereo- and regiospecificity, and lack of byproducts.1,2 Among enzymes currently attracting significant interest is laccase,
a benzenediol:oxygen oxidoreductase containing a multicopper core.3,4 Having a broad substrate specificity, laccase plays a multifaceted
role in biological synthesis including pigment formation, lignin degradation,
and cellular repair.5 Synthetically, laccases
are well-known for their ability to polymerize phenol and phenol derivatives
via oxidizing the phenol substrate with the concomitant reduction
of oxygen to water.3,6 This polymerization occurs through
the production of phenoxy radicals which can then undergo C–C
or C–O coupling at the ortho- and/or para-position. This ability
to easily oxidize phenols has allowed laccase to find a possible niche
for environmental cleanup from wastewaters of phenolic substances,
such as phenol and catechol, and synthetic dyes.7−9 Laccases have
also found use as catalysts for oxidative transformations of nonphenolic
small molecules, especially in the presence of radical mediators.
Such reactions include oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and ketones,
coupling of phenols and steroids, and carbon–nitrogen bond
formation.1−3

Regardless of the intended use, reactions involving
laccase as
a catalyst are continually inhibited by several common factors, namely,
the relatively high cost of laccase, activity limited to substrates
soluble in water, and low enzyme activity, resulting in prolonged
reaction times and reduced yields.10 To
circumvent these problems, modifications to the reaction conditions
are often made such as the addition of an organic cosolvent to increase
the solubility of the substrate and the immobilization of the enzyme
to afford reusability after each reaction cycle.4,11 However,
organic additives often lead to a decreased enzymatic activity over
time periods typical of an enzymatic reaction due to denaturation.12 Enzyme modifications such as immobilization
have also habitually resulted in a decreased enzymatic activity because
of severe restrictions in enzyme mobility in addition to the issues
involving active site orientation.4

Previously published work from our group13 showed that laccase was able to form complexes with amphiphilic
linear–dendritic and dendritic–linear–dendritic
copolymers composed of benzyl ether dendritic moieties and linear
poly(ethylene glycol), PEG. Complexation of laccase with both types
of copolymers via π–H interactions resulted in an increased
enzymatic activity toward water-soluble and water-insoluble substrates.
This enabled the unprecedented transformation of C60 in
water at very mild reaction conditions.14 This concept was further developed to produce an unnatural poly(amino
acid) directly from tyrosine.15 Although
linear–dendritic and dendritic–linear–dendritic
copolymer architectures have proven to increase the laccase activity
and reaction yields, their expense and time-intensive synthesis will
most likely limit their use in industrial applications. It is therefore
the aim of this study to find alternative complexing agents which
use similar mechanisms of complexation and which can be produced at
significantly reduced costs in a two-step synthesis.

Complexing
agents of interest include linear diblock poly(styrene)
(PS)–PEG and triblock PS–PEG–PS copolymers composed
of PEG and PS and linear–hyperbranched diblock and hyperbranched–linear–hyperbranched
triblock copolymers composed of the same linear PEG and hyperbranched
poly(p-chloromethylstyrene) (PPCMS). Copolymers capable
of forming hydrogels and micelles (Figure 1) will be synthesized because both groups
offer practical advantages: hydrogel complexes with the encapsulated
enzyme could be recycled, whereas micelles enable a greater substrate
diffusivity. Because of the ease at which molecular mass (MM) can
be controlled, atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP)16−18 will be employed to synthesize these new complexing agents. MM control
via ATRP will allow for the synthesis of amphiphilic copolymers capable
of self-assembling into either micelles or hydrogels by controlling
the hydrophilic/hydrophobic (PEG/PS and PEG/PPCMS) weight ratios.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
dl-Tyrosine (99+%),
2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS,
98+%), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT, 95+%), bromophenol blue (95%),
rhodamine B base (97%), methyl orange (95+%), and p-nitrophenyl palmitate (all from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO) were
used as received. Chlorobenzene (99+%, Acros) was degassed with argon
and stored over 4 Å molecular sieves. Laccase was produced and
used as previously described.19 All linear–dendritic
and dendritic–linear–dendritic copolymers were synthesized
by the coupling of preformed reactive fragments20 or via living ring-opening anionic polymerization of ethylene
oxide initiated by third-generation benzyl ether dendrons.21 All linear–linear and linear–hyperbranched
copolymers were produced by controlled radical polymerization (ATRP).
Details are provided in the Supporting Information.

2.2 Methods
2.2.1 NMR
Spectroscopy
1H
NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using CDCl3 as a solvent at 22 °C with a Bruker AVANCE 600 MHz instrument.

2.2.2 Dynamic Light Scattering
All dynamic
light scattering (DLS) measurements were performed on a Malvern Zetasizer
ZS instrument. The instrument used a 633 nm laser source with a fixed
backscattering detector at 173°. Size calculations were performed
using a CONTIN procedure.

2.2.3 UV–Vis Spectroscopy
All
UV–vis spectroscopic measurements for the enzymatic activity
and decolorization experiments were conducted on an Agilent 8453 UV–vis
spectrophotometer at room temperature in deionized (DI) water.

2.2.4 Immobilization of Enzymes via Solvent Exchange
Enzyme
complexation with all copolymers was conducted by first
dissolving 20 ± 0.5 mg of the desired copolymer in 200 μL
of tetrahydrofuran (THF). This solution was then added dropwise to
a vigorously stirring solution of laccase, previously diluted to 77
μkat/L. The complexed laccase solution was then allowed to equilibrate
for 4 h. All complexed laccase solutions were prepared immediately
before use.

2.2.5 Scanning Electron Microscopy
Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained by using a JEOL-5800-LV
SEM instrument with an acceleration voltage of 15 kV. The swollen
hydrogel samples were immersed in water for 48 h and then quickly
frozen with liquid nitrogen. The frozen hydrogels were subjected to
cryofracturing followed by lyophilization. The dry samples were sputter-coated
with gold for SEM analysis.

2.2.6 Enzyme
Activity Assay
Activity
assays of native laccase and laccase complexes were conducted using
ABTS as a substrate at room temperature. ABTS (5 mM) in DI water was
freshly prepared before each assay. After blanking the UV–vis
spectrophotometer with 1880 μL of DI water and 100 μL
of 5 mM ABTS solution, 20 μL of enzyme solution was added to
the spectrometer cell. The solution was mixed by inversion, and the
absorbance at 414 nm (ε414 = 36 000 M–1 cm–1)22 was recorded immediately every 7 s for 2 min or until a plateau
was observed. Enzyme activities were expressed in microkatals (μkat),
the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 1 μmol
of substrate/s at room temperature. For activity studies conducted
at temperatures other than room temperature, native laccase or complexed
laccase solutions were incubated in a water bath for 20 min and were
then immediately analyzed. Laccases with particularly high activities
were diluted by a factor of 100 prior to the assay. All activity tests
were completed in triplicates.

2.2.7 Polymerization
of Tyrosine
Polymerization
of tyrosine was conducted as previously described.15 Briefly, in a typical polymerization, 60 mg of dl-tyrosine is added to a vigorously stirred laccase (activity 77 μkat/L)
or complexed laccase solution. Polymerization of tyrosine was conducted
at 45 °C for 72 h. The unreacted monomer was removed via centrifugation.
The supernatant pH was then adjusted to 2.6–2.7 with HCl and
NaOH to precipitate poly(tyrosine). Further purification included
dissolving the obtained poly(tyrosine) in neutral DI water and precipitating
into THF to obtain a dark brown solid product. All polymerizations
were completed in triplicates.

2.2.8 Decolorization
of Synthetic Dyes
Decolorization of the synthetic dyes bromophenol
blue, methyl orange,
and rhodamine B base was conducted by first preparing a native laccase
or laccase complex solution with an enzyme concentration of 4 mg/mL
in an acetate buffer of pH 4.5. This solution was incubated at 45
°C for 4 h after which 0.77 mg of HOBT dissolved in 50 μL
of THF was added. The resulting solution was allowed to incubate for
an additional 2 h. To this solution, 1 mL of a stock dye solution
was added for a final dye concentration of 0.096 mg/mL. The absorbance
of the solution was recorded at predetermined time intervals at the
wavelengths of 592, 465, and 544 nm for bromophenol blue, methyl orange,
and rhodamine B base, respectively.

For recyclability studies,
experiments were set up as described above for the initial cycle (cycle
1). After complete decolorization, the solution was centrifuged for
the removal of the supernatant. Fresh dye and buffer were then added
for a second decolorization (cycle 2). After decolorization, this
solution was also centrifuged to remove the supernatant. Fresh laccase
in an amount equivalent to the first cycle, dye, and HOBT, unless
otherwise specified, were then added for the third cycle. This procedure
was repeated over eight cycles.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Copolymer Synthesis and
Characterization
The linear–linear and linear–hyperbranched
copolymers
were synthesized by ATRP using PEG functionalized with α-chlorophenylacetyl
chloride and either styrene or PCMS.16−18 The formation of the
copolymers was verified via 1H NMR and size-exclusion chromatography,
SEC (see description and Figures S1–S4 in the Supporting Information). MMs of the produced polymers (Table S1) were determined by comparing the aromatic
signals from the 1H NMR spectra to the ethylene signals
of PEG. The SEC traces of the produced linear(A)–linear(B) and linear(B)–linear(A)–linear(B) copolymers showed monomodal distributions, indicating an
efficient initiation of the macroinitiator and confirming that a homogeneous
product was obtained (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information).

3.2 Copolymer Self-Assembly
in Aqueous Media
Thirteen of the amphiphilic copolymers self-assemble
into micelles
(Table 1). With two
exceptions (PS750–PEG3k–PS750, 51% and PPCMS1.5k–PEG3k–PPCMS1.5k,
72%), their hydrophobic content is below 51%. All of these complexing
agents were found to form micelles with a peak hydrodynamic diameter
between 21 and 400 nm (Figures 2–4). Overall,
the MMs of the copolymer building blocks affected the hydrodynamic
diameters of the micelles formed. With the same PEG chain length,
macromolecules with larger hydrophobic domains formed micelles with
significantly higher hydrodynamic diameters (Figure 2).

Similarly, it was observed
that copolymers having hydrophobic blocks
of similar MM but longer PEG chains formed larger micelles compared
to their shorter analogues. This trend is evident when comparing PS–PEG–PS
complexing agents PS750–PEG3k–PS750 (hydrodynamic diameter
of 18.12 nm), PS750–PEG13k–PS750 (hydrodynamic diameter
of 327.4 nm), and PS1k–PEG20k–PS1k (hydrodynamic diameter
of 351.8 nm) (Figure 3).

Macromolecular architecture also seems to play a role in
the dimensions
of the micelles formed. With the hyperbranched blocks being more compact,
their supramolecular assemblies tend to have smaller hydrodynamic
diameters compared with their linear analogues (Figure 4).

By comparing the hydrodynamic diameters
of native laccase, an “empty”
copolymer micelle and the enzyme/copolymer complex formed by solvent
exchange (Figure 5)
indicate a noticeable increase in the hydrodynamic diameter. This
increase in diameter between 20 and 50 nm was observed often and is
evidence of the incorporation of enzyme into the micelles formed by
the synthesized copolymers (see also Figures S8–S10 in the Supporting Information).

Amphiphilic copolymers of the hydrophilic/hydrophobic
weight ratio
above 50% were capable of forming physical networks in aqueous solution
with two notable exceptions (linear–dendritic copolymers with
high-generation hydrophobic blocks: G3–PEG5k–G3 and
G3–poly(ethylene oxide) PEO13k–G4) (Table 1). SEM analyses showed that
the hydrogels have a well-developed pore-in-pore structure, which
did not change upon binding of the enzyme. An example is shown in Figure 6.

formed in water from the amphiphilic linear–dendritic
copolymer G3–PEG5k–G3: (A) self-assembled with no laccase
added and (B) self-assembled in the presence of laccase.

3.3 Activity of Complexed Laccase
toward ABTS
With the exception of PS750–PEG13k–PS750,
all micellar
complexes experienced a significant increase in activity (Table 1) at 45 °C. This
increase can be attributed to the favorable interactions between the
glycosidic regions of the enzyme and the hydrophobic portions of the
copolymers which facilitate the transportation of the substrate to
the enzyme active site. When comparing the linear–dendritic
and dendritic–linear–dendritic copolymers of equivalent
PEG chain lengths (PEG13kDa), it can be seen that increasing the dendron/PEG
weight ratio results in a beneficial effect on the enzyme activity
(Table 1). It was found
that for dendritic complexing agents, the size of the hydrophilic
PEG chain affects the form of self-assembly (micelle vs hydrogel)
and heavily influences the activity (Table 1, Figure 7), with G3–PEG5k–G3 (hydrogel) experiencing
one of the lowest activities. This is presumably due to the high density
of the network (see Figure 6) with relatively short interlink distances and a high hydrophobic
content, resulting in a low swelling and limited mobility of the enzyme
because of the shortened PEG chain length. These factors do not facilitate
the partitioning of the water-soluble ABTS substrate, its diffusion
into the hydrogel, and its interaction with the enzyme active site.

(green triangle), G3–PEO13k–G2/laccase (yellow circle),
and G4–PEO13k–G3/laccase (blue diamond).

With lower molecular weight PEG-based complexing
agents (PEG3kDa
and PEG monomethyl ether 5 kDa), longer linear hydrophobic regions
were found to induce higher activities (Figures 8 and 9). The contrary
was observed with PPCMS-containing copolymers, where the smaller hydrophobic
regions led to a higher activity (Figure 9). It should be noted that the PS2.7k–PEG3k–PS2.7k/laccase
complex had a remarkably high activity, approximately 3.5× that
of the native laccase at 60 °C and 10× that of the native
laccase at 20 °C (Figure 8).

(yellow circle), and PEG5k–PS5.2k/laccase (blue diamond).

For both PEG13kDa and PEG20kDa-based
copolymers, it was observed
that linear(B)–linear(A)–linear(B) and hyperbranched–linear–hyperbranched copolymers
are both capable of increasing the enzyme activity when the hydrophobic
regions are of sufficient size (Figures 10 and 11). Examples
of this trend include PPCMS2.3k–PEG13k–PPCMS2.3k and
PPCMS24k–PEG20k–PPCMS24k of hyperbranched–linear–hyperbranched
morphology and PS4.2k–PEG20k–PS4.2k and PS4.2k–PEG13k–PS4.2k
of linear(B)–linear(A)–linear(B) morphology which all contain hydrophobic/hydrophilic weight
ratios of at least 0.35 and show increased activities when compared
with the native enzyme. This is in contrast to the linear(B)–linear(A)–linear(B) complexing
agents PS750–PEG13k–PS750 and PS1k–PEG20k–PS1k
and the hyperbranched–linear–hyperbranched complexing
agent PPCMS2.5k–PEG20k–PPCMS2.5k which show activities
similar to that of the native laccase and have a noticeably lower
hydrophobic/hydrophilic weight ratio, most likely resulting in weak
interactions between the complexing agent and the enzyme.

PS4.2k–PEG20k–PS4.2k/laccase (blue diamond), and PPCMS24k–PEG20k–PPCMS24k/laccase
(purple square).

Both native and complexed
laccase experienced an increase in the
enzymatic activity with increasing temperature to a maximum between
60 and 65 °C (Figures 7–11). At 70 °C, all laccase
solutions showed diminished activities, with many showing none at
all. This significant decrease in activity is most likely due to the
denaturation of the enzyme at elevated temperature in addition to
the reduction in PEG solubility. As the hydrophilic part of all complexing
agents is composed of PEG, which experiences a reverse solubility
effect between 63 and 65 °C, a decrease in activity is not unexpected
because of the PEG collapse and the resulting restriction of enzyme
mobility and limited interaction with the substrates. When comparing
the linear–dendritic and dendritic–linear–dendritic
copolymers of PEG chain lengths of 13 kDa, it was observed that increasing
the dendron/PEG weight ratio resulted in beneficial effects on the
enzyme stability at elevated temperatures (Figure 6, G4–PEO13k–G3/laccase). This
increased enzyme stability is most likely due to more efficient dendron
docking onto the glycoside domains and a better shielding of the enzyme
from the surrounding environment.

PS2.7k–PEG3k–PS2.7k
could be singled out as the most
efficient complexing agent with activities increasing from 8000 μkat/L
to over 13 000 μkat/L in a temperature range of 45–65
°C (Figure 8).
This is in contrast to PPCMS6.5k–PEG3k–PPCMS6.5k/laccase
(a hyperbranched–linear–hyperbranched hydrogel with
the same PEG3kDa), which shows a little difference in activity from
the native enzyme. The same was seen with PS750–PEG3k–PS750/laccase
and PPCMS1.5k–PEG3k–PPCMS1.5k/laccase, which both show
moderate increases in activity. It was observed that laccase bound
to copolymers of PEG13kDa and PEG20kDa with large linear hydrophobic
blocks experienced limited benefits in regard to activity and stability.
This might be due to the inefficient adhesion of the linear hydrophobic
fragments onto the glycoside regions (with an increased screening
of the active site) and the loose enzyme association within the large
network pores as well.

3.4 Application of Immobilized
Laccase for Tyrosine
Polymerizations
To determine the application of complexed
laccase for the transformation of substrates with low water solubility,
tyrosine polymerizations were conducted using a previously described
method.15

It was found that G3–PEG5k–G3
had the highest yield (85.5%), whereas PS10k–PEG13k–PS10k
had the lowest yield (51.1%) (Table 1). Overall, it was observed that a high activity (as
determined with ABTS) does not necessarily result in a high poly(tyrosine)
yield. This is most likely due to the differences between ABTS and
tyrosine in their partitioning coefficients and diffusion through
the complexing agents. Additionally, weakly complexed enzymes, which
still experience the beneficial activity effects of copolymer association,
would have larger pore sizes than those of more tightly complexed
enzymes (G3–PEG5k–G3/laccase) which bind tyrosine closer
in proximity to the enzyme active site. With few exceptions, it was
found that linear-based complexes had a noticeably reduced yield when
compared with either linear–dendritic, dendritic–linear–dendritic,
linear–hyperbranched, or hyperbranched–linear–hyperbranched
complexing agents. This is most likely the result of linear-based
complexes forming micelles or hydrogels with the hydrophobic regions
of increased density. This increased density leads to a lower tyrosine
binding capacity and likely hampers the permeation of tyrosine to
the enzyme active site. It was found that micelles in general had
a higher yield (70.75%) when compared with the hydrogels (68.13%),
most probably a result of greater substrate diffusion efficacy in
micelles.

In regard to poly(tyrosine) microstructure (C–C
vs C–O
coupling), the presence of any complexing agent had no apparent effect,
with all polymers synthesized containing a C–O coupling of
approximately 76.4%.

3.5 Decolorization of Synthetic
Dyes
To determine the applicability of the synthesized immobilizing
agents
for bioremediation purposes, the decolorization of bromophenol blue,
methyl orange, and rhodamine B base (all of them being common synthetic
dyes) was investigated. The hydrogel complexes showing the most suitable
activity/easiness of production ratio were chosen for the trials (PS2.7k–PEG3k–PS2.7k
and PPCMS24k–PEG20k–PPCMS24k). Compared to previously
reported literature values23 for bromophenol
blue, the observed reaction rate was markedly higher. HOBT, a radical
mediator, was required for the treatment of methyl orange and rhodamine;
it also significantly enhanced the decolorization rate of bromophenol
blue. The hydrogel complexes degraded the dyes at a slower rate than
the native laccase (Figures 12 and 13), presumably because of the
slower substrate diffusion through the hydrogel to the enzyme active
site. On the other side, it should be noted that methyl orange is
repeatedly (!) transformed at the same rate as with the pure enzyme.
This clearly indicates that partition coefficient of the substrate
(dye in this case) plays a major role in defining (enhancing or slowing)
the rate of diffusion and ultimately the rate of the reaction. However,
the physical entrapment of the biocatalyst within these networks did
allow for the reusability of both the laccase and immobilizing agent.
The enzymatic hydrogels were recycled by centrifuging and the removal
of the supernatant. After the introduction of a fresh dye and buffer,
a reduced speed of decolorization was observed (second cycle and every
even cycle). Several factors might have contributed for this lower
rate. Model experiments, performed at the same conditions (copolymer,
centrifugation speed, temperature, and enzyme concentration), showed
that during centrifugation, a part of the enzyme was “squeezed”
out of the hydrogels because of their intrinsic softness (Figure S12
in the Supporting Information). During
centrifugation, gravitational forces might have also caused the collapse
of the pores, thus reducing the diffusivity of the soft networks (see Figure 6). Addition of fresh
laccase and HOBT to the swollen hydrogels was found to restore the
activity to levels close to those of the original solution (third
cycle and every odd cycle thereafter). In that way, an economy of
50% enzyme and mediator could be achieved while using the same initial
carrier hydrogel (100% network recyclability).

laccase in PS2.7k–PEG3k–PS2.7k
hydrogel for decoloring bromophenol blue with HOBT additive (A), bromophenol
blue without HOBT additive (B), methyl orange with HOBT additive (C),
and rhodamine B base with HOBT additive (D). Fresh HOBT and/or laccase
was added every odd cycle (full symbols).

hydrogel for decoloring bromophenol blue with HOBT additive (A), bromophenol
blue without HOBT additive (B), methyl orange with HOBT additive (C),
and rhodamine B base with HOBT additive (D). Fresh HOBT and/or laccase
was added every odd cycle (full symbols).

The proposed laccase/HOBT-catalyzed degradation mechanism
of bromophenol
blue (Scheme 1) centers
on the disruption of the quinone–phenol resonance structure
of bromophenol blue. Under the reaction conditions used (pH 4.5 buffer),
this structure is favored, allowing for a hydroxyl radical attack.
Further degradation occurs with the radical-facilitated removal of
bromine from the molecule, resulting in a colorless degradation product.
Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry
(MALDI-TOF MS) of the degradation mixture confirms the loss of four
bromine atoms and the addition of a hydroxyl group (see product with
365 m/z in Figure S13B). The NMR monitoring of bromophenol blue degradation shows
the appearance of four additional equivalent aromatic hydrogens at
7.96 ppm (H6, Figure 14), confirming the loss and replacement of bromine with
hydrogen. Further evidence for the proposed mechanism is provided
by the coincidence of NMR data (integral intensity ratio H6/H1, Figure 14) with the colorimetric assay results (Figure 15).

of bromophenol
blue degradation.

by native laccase/HOBT monitored by
NMR (blue circle) and colorimetric assay (orange diamond). Ar-OH H/ArSO3 H is the ratio of the integral intensity for aromatic hydrogen
at 7.96 ppm (Ar-OH H, H6 in Figure 14) to constant aromatic hydrogen at 8.06
ppm (ArSO3 H, H1 in Figure 14).

4 Conclusions
and Outlook
Amphiphilic linear(A)–linear(B), linear(B)–linear(A)–linear(B), linear–hyperbranched, and hyperbranched–linear–hyperbranched
copolymers composed of PEG of various chain lengths and either PS
or PPCMS were synthesized via ATRP for use as enzyme complexing agents.
DLS studies confirmed that micellar complexing agents were capable
of binding to the enzyme, resulting in the desired complex. PS2.7k–PEG3k–PS2.7k,
a linear(B)–linear(A)–linear(B) PEG3kDa-based copolymer, provided the greatest benefit
to the enzyme activity and stability at elevated temperatures (up
to +1245% vs the native enzyme), while producing only a modest increase
in the tyrosine polymerization yield (+13.7% vs the native enzyme).
Although G3–PEG5k–G3 was found to substantially reduce
the enzyme activity (433 vs 1999 μkat/L), it provided the largest
tyrosine polymerization yield at 85.5% because of its strong binding
of the substrate. Thus, the macromolecular architecture of the complexing
agents has a strong influence on polymerization yields. Overall, the
laccase complexes of linear–dendritic copolymers produced poly(tyrosine)
with the highest yield followed by the linear–hyperbranched
analogues, probably because of the nanoporosity of their hydrophobic
blocks, which facilitates efficient sequestration and binding of the
hydrophobic substrate and its migration to the active site. In contrast,
the dense packing of the PS blocks during the self-assembly of the
linear–linear copolymers prevents the efficient binding and
transport of tyrosine to the active site of laccase.

An increased
enzymatic activity resulting from enzyme complexing
reported in this work is an encouraging improvement over the traditional
immobilization methods, which often result in significant activity
decreases either from the decreased enzyme mobility, restriction of
the substrate access to the enzyme active site, or limited diffusion
of the substrate to the enzyme.24 Current
examples which exemplify these shortcomings include the immobilization
of laccase via entrapment in alginate–gelatin gels, which resulted
in an activity decrease of 15%,25 and the
covalent immobilization of laccase to titania nanoparticles, which
incurred an activity decrease between 21 and 85%.26 In an earlier report by Mateescu et al., the final activity
of laccase, immobilized on p-benzoquinone-activated
agarose, was only 27% compared to the free laccase because of an insufficient
laccase binding of only 18%.27 Thus, the
laccase complexation method reported in this work offers distinct
advantages to many previously reported immobilization methods regarding
retained activity.

Successful decolorizations of the synthetic
dyes bromophenol blue,
methyl orange, and rhodamine B base display the versatility of immobilized
laccase to decolor a wide array of dyes (phenolic, diazo, and heterocyclic).
The broad substrate specificity and reusability of the immobilized
laccase make the described complexing method very desirable for bioremediation
and other catalytic roles.
