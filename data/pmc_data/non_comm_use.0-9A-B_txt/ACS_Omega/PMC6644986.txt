Bi(OTf)3·xH2O is a
powerful catalyst for the dehydration of tertiary alcohols into alkenes
in apolar solvents. The reaction proceeds smoothly and selectively,
with amounts as low as 0.01 mol % catalyst, in yields up to 93%. Moreover,
in polar solvents, Bi(OTf)3·xH2O (0.1–1 mol %) selectively catalyzes the dimerization
of the alcohols instead, forming new C–C bonds, in yields up
to 96%. This mild, efficient, economic, and eco-friendly method is
applicable across different chemical classes and amenable to several
functional groups.

Introduction
The dehydration of
alcohols into the corresponding alkenes is a
widely used reaction in organic syntheses.1 Moreover, alkenes produced from alcohols largely present in biomass
are critical raw materials for the production of plastics, fibers,
and polymeric products.2,3 The dehydration of alcohols into
alkenes is typically made using acid catalysis at elevated temperatures.1,3 However, these reaction conditions promote side reactions, including
cyclization and rearrangement of the starting materials, and are far
from ideal for compounds bearing labile chemical groups. Therefore,
the pursuit of selective methods to dehydrate alcohols, through mild,
cost-effective, and efficient catalysis, remains a subject of interest
for organic chemists.4

Bismuth(III)
salts are versatile reagents for a variety of organic
reactions,5 including syntheses of pharmaceutically
interesting compounds as well as natural products.6 In addition to their broad reactivity, these compounds
are relatively nontoxic and easy to handle, and therefore bismuth(III)-based
chemistry is viewed as eco-friendly. Within bismuth(III) salts, Bi(OTf)3·xH2O is appealing because
it is commercially available, inexpensive, potentially reusable, and
chemically versatile, as it can promote either Lewis or Brønsted
acid catalysis.5h,7

Bismuth(III) halides react
with alcohols when used in stoichiometric
amounts, in carbon tetrachloride, at reflux.8 BiCl3 halogenates all alcohol types other than primary,
with dehydration as a side reaction, to give alkenes in low yields.
Under the same conditions, BiBr3 dehydrates secondary and
tertiary alcohols to the corresponding alkenes, but its reaction with
benzylic alcohols gives ethers as the main product. Alkenes are also
obtained from the reaction of secondary and tertiary alcohols with
Ph3BiBr2/I2 in cyclohexane.9 However, under these conditions, some reactions
are plagued by competing iodination. Altogether, these results suggest
that Bi(OTf)3·xH2O may
be a suitable reagent for the dehydration of alcohols. Nonetheless,
to the best of our knowledge, no study has yet addressed this question.

As a part of our ongoing work toward the semisynthesis of diterpenoids
scarcely available from their natural sources,10 we recently became interested in suitable methods to build
a 13-propenyl side chain onto the diterpenic alcohol 1. This modification is common to antiochic acid,11 diterpenoids from Pinus massoniana,12 aquilarabietic acid H from Chinese
eaglewood,13 and bodinieric acids C and
F from Callicarpa bodinieri,14 some bearing relevant bioactivities. However,
literature searches revealed that the methods available require halogenated
reagents, nongreen solvents, or metals in strong acidic solutions,
which are difficult to integrate in total syntheses campaigns.15−17 Therefore, we first studied the reactivity of Bi(OTf)3·xH2O toward alcohol dehydration
using 1 as a starting material.

Results and Discussion
In the presence of 5 mol % Bi(OTf)3·xH2O, in refluxing chloroform, 1 was successfully
converted into 2, after 2 h and in 63% yield, after chromatographic
purification (Table 1, entry 1). Similar results were observed with 1 mol % of Bi(OTf)3·xH2O (entry 2) and the overall
amount of salt could be lowered to 0.1 mol %, with a gain in yield
and extension of the reaction time (entry 3). However, under these
reaction conditions, formation of 3 as a side product,
with an ethoxy group at position 15 occurred (Scheme 1), most likely because of the presence of
ethanol used as a stabilizer for chloroform.

reflux.

d Dry solvent.

e Yield calculated from the 1H NMR spectra.

To rule out this effect, we next
screened the reaction in dichloromethane
(Table 1, entries 4–5)
and in ethanol (entries 6–11). Indeed, in dichloromethane,
the reaction proceeded with 0.1 mol % of Bi(OTf)3·xH2O, at reflux or room temperature, without
formation of 3, and alkene 2 was isolated,
in 84–88% yield. The reaction was slower at room temperature
and a small amount of 1 remained unmodified. In addition,
traces of a side product which we later identified as dimeric compound 4 was formed (entries 4–5). No reactivity was observed
in dry ethanol with 0.1 mol % of Bi(OTf)3·xH2O (entry 6) and when the amount of salt was
increased to 20 mol % increasing the amounts of 3 formed
as expected (entries 7–10). However, in nondry ethanol (entry
11), a major change in the reactivity occurred. Compound 3 did not form and a mixture of the two dimeric compounds 4 and 5a was instead obtained.
This result pointed to the dramatic effect of water in the reaction
outcome.

The results in dry 1,4-dioxane (entries 12–13)
corroborated
this finding and further revealed that solvent polarity is another
crucial parameter toward the reaction outcome. Thus, there was no
reactivity with 0.1 mol % of Bi(OTf)3·xH2O in dry solvent, at reflux, whereas 74% of 2 was isolated as the single reaction product, using 1 mol % of salt,
under the same conditions. In the absence of water, 4 and 5 did not form, and in nonpolar solvents such as
1,4-dioxane and dichloromethane, the formation of the alkene derivative 2 was favored. A very high yield of 2 was also
obtained in a relatively nonpolar tetrahydrofuran (THF) (entry 14),
even if nondry. In polar, nondry solvents such as acetonitrile or
nitromethane (entries 15–18), in a similar fashion to ethanol
(entry 11), 4 and 5 became the major reaction
products. The use of 1 mol % of Bi(OTf)3·xH2O in refluxing nitromethane was ideal for the preparation
of 4.

The findings in Table 1 suggest a Brønsted acid behavior for
Bi(OTf)3·xH2O as opposed
to Lewis acid,
in the reaction mechanism, that is, triflic acid is produced in situ
from Bi(OTf)3·xH2O, which
then drives the reaction forward (Scheme 1). To gain further evidence of Brønsted
acid-mediated catalysis, 1 was reacted with Bi(OTf)3·xH2O (1 mol %), in dichloromethane,
at reflux, in the presence of 2,6-di-t-butylpyridine
(10 mol %),18 a proton scavenger that is
unable to coordinate to metal ions because of the bulky t-butyl groups. No reactivity was observed, indicating the need for
protons in the reaction medium to promote it, according to Scheme 1. In addition, when
the reaction was made using triflic acid (10 mol %), full conversion
of 1 into 2, 4, and 5 occurred in 58, 25, and 6% yields, respectively, in 2 h.

We
also investigated whether Bi(OTf)3·xH2O could promote the direct homodimerization of 2 based on a previous study on the heterodimerization of vinylarenes
where indium triflate was a Lewis acid catalyst.19 However, we found that this was not the case as in refluxing
1,4-dioxane, with 5 mol % of Bi(OTf)3·xH2O, no reactivity was observed and with 10 mol %, formation
of a mixture of dimers 4 and 5 occurred,
without exhaustion of the starting material. Exploration of other
solvents including a 3:1 mixture of THF and cyclohexane20 in the presence of 10 mol % of Bi(OTf)3·xH2O resulted in no reactivity,
even after 24 h, at reflux. Nitromethane was the best solvent for
this modification; however, 5 mol % of Bi(OTf)3·xH2O was required, and several products were
formed among which the mixture of dimers 4 and 5 was the major.

Overall, the results suggest that alkene 2 is formed
by protonation of the hydroxy group at position C13 of 1, which forms a good leaving group and a very stable tertiary carbocation
(Scheme 1). Compound 3 forms in chloroform only because of the presence of ethanol
which acts as a nucleophile. Dimers 4 and 5 form after electrophilic addition of the carbocation to the double
bond of 2. A new tertiary carbocation forms which is
converted into 4 and 5 in the presence of
water. In nondry solvents, water originates most likely from Bi(OTf)3·xH2O which is hygroscopic.
Of note, the formation of 4 and 5 is in
line with previous reports describing the dimerization of styrene
catalyzed by acids21 as well as via proton
transfer to carbonyl compounds.22 The “super
acid” triflimide was also reported to promote the hydroalkenylation
of vinylarenes.20 In all cases, the formation
of a benzylic cation which suffers attack by vinylarenes through nucleophilic
addition, followed by deprotonation to form the dimeric product, is
proposed as the reaction mechanism.

Different metal salts were
next screened for comparison with Bi(OTf)3·xH2O. The results are depicted
on Table 2, showing
that none of the tested salts was better for the synthesis of 2 from 1.

b Yield after purification by FCC.

We further investigated the scope of the reaction
using other diterpenic
benzylic alcohols (6–9), bearing different functional
groups (Scheme 2).
We extended the set to accommodate the nonbenzylic sesquiterpenic
tertiary alcohol cedrol 14, the nonterpenic benzylic
alcohol 16, a nonbenzylic tertiary alcohol 19, and the steroidal secondary alcohol 5α-cholestan-3β-ol 22. The reaction was successful in all diterpenic alcohols
tested, although there was a need to increase the amounts of catalyst
used to exhaust the starting materials, most likely because of the
presence of atoms which coordinate with Bi(OTf)3·xH2O and somewhat diminish its catalytic power.
Nonetheless, compounds 10–13 were all successfully
prepared and isolated in yields ranging from 63 to 83%, after chromatographic
purification. The reaction was also successful for the dehydration
of cedrol 14 into cedrene 15, in 91% yield.

5 mol % Bi(OTf)3·xH2O was used.

Notably,
alcohol 16 gave the alkene 17 and the dimer 18, with 94.6% conversion, in an 83:17
ratio, with as little as 0.01 mol % of the catalyst. Moreover, alcohol 19 gave alkenes 20 and 21 in a ratio
of 93:7, with a 96.6% conversion, albeit with a higher amount of catalyst,
reflecting the lower reactivity of nonbenzylic alcohols toward this
method. In line with this finding, the reaction was unsuccessful for
the dehydration of 22. These results support the proposed
reaction mechanism which proceeds via formation of a carbocation,
and the observed reactivity reflects the stability of the participant
carbocation formed in each case, that is, benzylic alcohols are the
most reactive followed by tertiary alcohols, and secondary alcohols
are unreactive.

In nitromethane, alcohol 16 gave
the indane derivative 23 with an amount as low as 0.1
mol % catalyst, in 67% yield,
along with the dimeric products 24 and 18 as minor products (Scheme 2). This result is not entirely surprising because a previous
study reports the preparation of 23 from 16 in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of BiBr3 in
chloroform, after cyclization of 18, at high temperatures.23 In sharp contrast, using an amount as low as
0.1 mol % of Bi(OTf)3·xH2O in nitromethane, we prepared the dimer 18 from the
small alcohol 16, as the single reaction product, at
room temperature, in 96% yield. Cyclization toward indane products
was never observed with 1 most likely because of stereochemical
impediment.

To illustrate the utility of our method, we used
Bi(OTf)3·xH2O as an alcohol
dehydrating
agent for the unprecedented semisynthesis of diterpenoids from P. massoniana,12 starting
from commercially available dehydroabietic acid 25 (Scheme 3). The alkene 2 was a key intermediate, and the desired product 27b was synthesized over five steps.

Acid 27
In conclusion, herein, we show that the reaction of Bi(OTf)3·xH2O with tertiary alcohols
is tunable toward obtaining either alkenes or dimers, in high yields
and selectivity. This method employs an eco-friendly and relatively
inexpensive catalyst, in very low loading, for accessing two different,
novel and practical synthetic methodologies, under reaction conditions,
amenable to a variety of functional groups. We believe this method
is of general utility in the field of organic chemistry and can in
addition be easily incorporated into total syntheses design.

Experimental
Section
General Remarks
Dehydroabietic acid (90% purity) was
purchased from Pfaltz & Bauer, USA, and other reagents were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich Co, VWR International Oy or Fluorochem Ltd. Silica
gel 60 F254 was used for thin-layer chromatography. FCC was made with
a Biotage High-Performance Flash Chromatography Sp4-system (Uppsala,
Sweden). The apparatus has a 0.1 mm path length flow cell UV detector/recorder
module (fixed wavelength: 254 nm). SNAP cartridges of 10, 25, or 50
g were used in the purifications with a flow rate of 10–50
mL/min. A Vertex 70 (Bruker Optics Inc., MA, USA) FTIR instrument
was used to collect the IR spectra, with a horizontal attenuated total
reflectance (ATR) accessory (MIRacle, Pike Technology, Inc, WI, USA).
Transmittance (4000–600 cm–1) was recorded
at a 4 cm–1 resolution, and spectra were produced
with the OPUS 5.5 (Bruker Optics Inc., MA, USA) software. For NMR
analysis collected on a Bruker Ascend 400 spectrometer, in CDCl3 or CD3OD with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal
standard, chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm)
and on the δ scale from TMS. The coupling constant J is quoted in hertz. A Waters UPLC-ESI/QTOF-MS using a Synapt G2
HDMS (Waters, MA, USA) instrument was used for the exact mass analysis.
Purity was executed with Waters Acquity UPLC system (Waters, Milford
MA, USA) attached to Acquity PDA detector and Waters Synapt G2 HDMS
mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford MA, USA) via an ESI ion source.
An Agilent 7890A GC system attached to Agilent 7000 GS/MS Triple Quad
was used for the collection of GC–MS. The preparation and characterization
of compounds 6, 8, and 9 have
been previously reported.10 Compounds 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, and 13 have not been previously reported
and were obtained as amorphous solids.

General Procedure for the
Bi(OTf)3·xH2O-Catalyzed
Dehydration of Alcohols
To a stirred
solution of the alcohol (0.050 g) in dichloromethane (1.8 mL), Bi(OTf)3·xH2O was added. The temperature
was raised to reflux, and stirring was continued for 2 h. The solvent
was evaporated under vacuum, the residue was diluted with ethyl acetate
(10 mL), and water (5 mL) was added. The aqueous phase was extracted
with ethyl acetate (2 × 10 mL). The combined organic phases were
washed with a saturated aqueous solution of NaHCO3 (10
mL), water (10 mL), brine (10 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and filtered. After removal of the solvent under
reduced pressure, the resulting crude product was purified by flash
chromatography on silica gel using ethyl acetate in n-hexane (0 → 100%) as the eluant.

a The configuration of dimeric compound 5 was assigned to E based on the NOESY correlation
between the 17′-H signal of the double bond at 6.14 ppm and
the methyl group protons signals at 1.51 pm (Table 1).

b The α-orientation of H-7 was
assigned by the presence of a NOESY-correlation of H-5/H-7 and the
broad triplet at 4.75 (t, J = 8.8 Hz), consistent
with a previous study (see ref (12)).
