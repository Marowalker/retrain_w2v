The principal intent
of this work is to explore whether the site-specific
binding of a newly synthesized quinoline-appended anthracenyl chalcone,
(E)-3-(anthracen-10-yl)-1-(6,8-dibromo-2-methylquinolin-3-yl)prop-2-en-1-one
(ADMQ), with an extracellular protein of the human circulatory system,
human serum albumin (HSA), can control the rotamerization of its sole
tryptophan residue, Trp-214. With this aim, we have systematically
studied the binding affinity, interactions, and localization pattern
of the title compound inside the specific binding domain of the transport
protein and any conformation alteration caused therein. Multiple spectroscopic
experiments substantiated by an in silico molecular modeling exercise
provide evidence for the binding of the guest ADMQ in the hydrophobic
domain of HSA, which is primarily constituted by residues Trp-214,
Arg-218, Arg-222, Asp-451, and Tyr-452. Rotationally restricted ADMQ
prefers to reside in Sudlow site I (subdomain IIA) of HSA in close
proximity (2.45 nm) to the intrinsic fluorophore Trp-214 and is interestingly
found to control its vital rotamerization process. The driving force
for this rotational interconversion is predominantly found to be governed
by the direct interaction of ADMQ with Trp-214. However, the role
of induced conformational perturbation in the biomacromolecule itself
upon ADMQ adoption cannot be ruled out completely, as indicated by
circular dichroism, 3D fluorescence, root-mean-square deviation, root-mean-square
fluctuation, and secondary structure element observations. The comprehensive
spectroscopic study outlined herein provides important information
on the biophysical interaction of a chalcone-based potential therapeutic
candidate with a carrier protein, exemplifying its utility in having
a regulatory effect on the microconformations of Trp-214.

1 Introduction
Chalcones
and their heterocyclic derivatives1,2 are
recognized for their plethora of promising pharmacological activities
due to their DNA-targeting properties,3,4 proven gametocytocidal
activity in the life cycle of Plasmodium falciparum,5 superior vasodilative properties in
treating hypertension,6,7 and usefulness for the treatment
of inflammatory diseases.8,9 Investigations of the
binding mechanisms of several bioactive compounds with the transport
protein human serum albumin (HSA) present in the human circulatory
system is an important course to understand the behavior of drugs
in terms of therapeutics as well as toxicity.10−15 Simultaneously it is also significant to apprehend their transport
and disposition under physiological conditions.16 In this context, HSA, a well-structured major circulatory
system protein, binds such ligands and also acts as an important determinant
for the study of the pharmacokinetics of the drug molecules.17

The fluorescence of HSA is predominantly
governed by the sole Trp
residue along with minor contributions from few tyrosines. Out of
these, Trp is the most investigated fluorescent probe for protein
conformation and dynamics.18,19 The presence of the
highly sensitive indole side chain in Trp makes it more capable for
exploring the conformational ensembles of proteins in solution.18 The fluorescence emission profile of Trp is
sensitive to slight transitions in the protein quaternary structure,
ligand binding, or any other subunit association. The governing fluorophore
Trp displays strong emission in the 310–350 nm region (when
excited at its absorption maximum) and also exhibits multiexponential
decay with fluorescence lifetimes ranging from 50 ps to 8 ns.20 This multiexponential fluorescence decay may
be attributed to its various ground-state conformers. Upon interaction
with a ligand, the populations of Trp rotamers display variation in
their percentage distribution. More precisely, the Trp rotamerization
is governed by the orientation of the aromatic heterocyclic indole
group, whose changes in geometry are so fast that they can only be
captured on a shorter time scale. The different deactivation pathways
and rates of depopulation of the excited state account for the existence
of different decay times for each rotamer.21 The decay profile of the host HSA is sensitive to the ligand, which
may have a direct influence on the microenvironment of the sole Trp
residue.18 The extent of interaction between
the Trp residue and ligand/quencher is governed by their distance
and relative orientation.

Hence, the different rotamer populations
of Trp in HSA provide
key information on the binding mode of the ligand.21−24 In this context, the interaction
of quinoline-appended chalcone derivatives (which are highly bioactive
and characterized by rich photophysical properties) with human plasma
proteins may be of great interest as it can alter the pharmacodynamics
and pharmacokinetics (including distribution, metabolism, and elimination)
of chalcone-based pharmaceutically relevant molecules.

In this
article, we demonstrate the site-specific interaction and
mode of binding of a newly synthesized multitherapeutic quinoline-appended
chalcone derivative, (E)-3-(anthracen-10-yl)-1-(6,8-dibromo-2-methylquinolin-3-yl)prop-2-en-1-one
(ADMQ), with the model plasma protein HSA and its consequences using
optical spectroscopic methodologies. The spectroscopic results obtained
herein are vindicated by computational molecular modeling studies.
Besides, the understanding of the Trp emissive characteristics by
virtue of the population distribution of its rotamers evokes interest
as to whether the vital Trp rotamerization process is controlled by
induced conformational changes or direct interaction of the binding
ligand with Trp.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Insights into the Interaction and Binding
Affinity of ADMQ with HSA
Each ligand/drug present in the
circulatory system binds with serum albumin (SA) to a different extent,
which affects the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion
(ADME) properties as well as the toxicity of the drug. Thus, it is
well-recognized that SA present in human blood binds with the ligand/drug
reversibly, which essentially affects the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics
of the drug/ligand.25 In the case of hydrophobic
drugs, protein binding enhances the solubility of the ligand in human
plasma. Thus, it is necessary to get acquainted with protein–drug
binding studies in order to determine the biochemical consequences
of the synthesized/designed drug inside the human body, which may
further facilitate formulation efficacy.25−28 Hence, it is necessary to understand
the exact mode and affinity of binding of ADMQ with HSA. The intrinsic
fluorescence of plasma protein can be monitored using steady-state
fluorescence spectroscopy.18 This emission
is attributed to the sole Trp-214 (in subdomain IIA) and 18 tyrosine
residues.29,30 For the ADMQ–HSA system, a wavelength
of 295 nm was chosen for excitation to selectively monitor the emission
of Trp-214 (exclusively at 340 nm) at three different temperatures:
298, 303, and 308 K. When the ligand ADMQ was gradually introduced
into the aqueous HSA solution at pH 7.4, a concomitant diminution
in the protein fluorescence along with a 4 nm hypsochromic shift (340
to 336 nm) in the emission maximum was observed (Figure 1A).

Figure 1 (A) Variation in the
emission spectrum of HSA upon subsequent addition
of ADMQ at 298 K (λex = 295 nm). Curves A through
P correspond to [ADMQ] = 0, 4.95, 9.85, 14.7, 19.5, 24.3, 29, 33.7,
38.3, 42.9, 47.4, 51.9, 56.3, 60.7, 65.1, and 69.4 μM, respectively.

308 K. (C) Modified SV plots for the ADMQ–HSA system at 298,
303, and 308 K.

This progressive diminution
of the tryptophan fluorescence by ADMQ
suggests its binding interaction with the host protein molecule, whereas
the increased hydrophobicity around the fluorophore is manifested
by the hypsochromic shift. The above-said fluorescence quenching phenomenon
is quantified by the Stern–Volmer (SV) equation:31−33 1  where F and F0 are the
steady-state fluorescence intensities in the
presence and absence of the quencher ADMQ, respectively, KSV is the SV quenching constant, [Q] is the total concentration
of quencher (ADMQ), and τ0 is the average lifetime
of the protein in the absence of ADMQ and here is considered to be
1 × 10–8 s.

The SV plots thus obtained
(Figure 1B) exhibit
an upward deviation at higher ADMQ concentrations
(for all three temperatures), as reported earlier for many other drug–protein
interactions.16,33 The calculated KSV is on the order of 104, and kq is on the order of 1012 (much higher than
the value for a diffusion-controlled process, where kq = 2.0 × 1010 M–1 s–1), indicating the interaction of ADMQ with HSA via
formation of a ground-state complex. This was further confirmed by
the destabilization of the complex formed by increasing the temperature
to 308 K (Table 1).
Overall, the biphasic nature of the SV plot in the steady-state fluorescence
quenching experiment suggested that a dual static and dynamic quenching
mechanism is operative, which was further confirmed by time-resolved
fluorescence (TRF) studies (discussed later).

Determination
of the Binding Affinity
The quenching
data were further analyzed in order to determine the binding affinity
of ADMQ with HSA using the following modified SV (MSV) equation:17 2  

The affinity constants Ka were obtained
with correlation coefficients of 0.99
(Figure 1C) and are
listed in Table 1.
The magnitude of Ka was found to be on
the order of 104, which implies moderate binding affinity
of ADMQ toward HSA.

TRF measurements were also employed to ascertain
the simultaneous
involvement of dynamic quenching (if any, along with static quenching)
in the binding process. In this context, the mean fluorescence lifetime
(τm) was obtained using the following expression:34  where αi is the relative percentage contribution of the decay component
possessing
lifetime τi. From the TRF results
for HSA (shown in Table 4), it can be seen that τm significantly decreases
from 4.51 to 0.74 ns upon gradual addition of ADMQ to the protein
solution. The SV plot obtained from the mean fluorescence lifetimes,
which is depicted in Figure 2, follows linearity only up to [ADMQ] = 40 μM. Intriguingly,
an upward curvature is seen at higher concentrations of ADMQ, which
indicates possibilities such as (i) the presence of a sphere of action
around the fluorophore35 and (ii) the operation
of simultaneous static and dynamic quenching.18 However, these possibilities may come into play individually or
simultaneously.

concentration.

Thermodynamics of the Binding Interaction
Generally,
four kinds of non-covalent interactions govern the binding of the
ligand to the protein that eventually help to extract the thermodynamic
parameters. These includes van der Waals interactions, H-bond formation,
electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions.36 Ross and Subramanian37 reported that the signs and magnitudes of the thermodynamic parameters
so obtained indicate the predominant forces involved in binding of
the ligand to the protein. The enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) of formation of the ADMQ–HSA
complex were determined on the basis of the van’t Hoff equation
(eq 3): 3  where K is in the present
case the association constant Ka, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute
temperature. The data are pooled in Table 2.

a R is the correlation
coefficient.

b SD is the
standard deviation.

The
slope of the van’t Hoff plot is related to ΔH, while the intercept of the plot indicates ΔS (Figure 3). The value
of ΔG is calculated using the
expression 4  The negative value of ΔG obtained indicates that the formation of the complex between
ADMQ
and HSA is spontaneous. The obtained values of ΔS and ΔH are positive, indicating that the
binding process mainly involves hydrophobic interactions. It is assumed
that whenever the ligand binds to the protein in water-accessible
area,38 the protein releases the excess
solvent from its surface, thus driving the entropy to a positive value.
From this perspective, it can be concluded that the nonpolar quinoline
and anthracene groups can effectively interact with amino acids present
in the hydrophobic region. Hence, we can presume the involvement of
hydrophobic interactions to be predominant in securing the ligand
ADMQ into the protein scaffold.

temperatures.

2.2 Protein-Induced
Rotational Confinement
The principle of fluorescence anisotropy
measurements lies in photoselective
excitation of a fluorescent molecule using polarized light that ultimately
results in polarized emission. It is important to note that transition
dipole moments for absorption and emission lie in specific directions
within the fluorophore structure. Such anisotropic measurements provide
an outlook for protein conformational dynamics. Fluorescence anisotropy
strongly depends on various factors such as solvent viscosity, fluorophore
shape, and protein flexibility. A higher value of the anisotropy is
observed as the environment around fluorophore becomes restricted
and hinders its rotational diffusion. The anisotropy value in fluids
gradually decreases because of the ease of rotation of the fluorophore
molecule, but rotation can be restricted in different matrixes such
as micelles, reverse micelles, dextrin, etc.39 In the present experiment, variation in the anisotropy of ADMQ was
recorded with increasing concentration of HSA by monitoring the emission
of excited ADMQ only. It is relevant to mention here that the synthesized
molecule ADMQ exhibits two distinct absorption bands at 259 and 434
nm in water and shows a remarkable emission with a maximum at around
550 nm (λex = 434 nm) in water.40

The plot (Figure 4) shows that as the concentration of HSA was increased,
the fluorescence anisotropy (r) increased to a value
of r ≈ 0.232 at 260 μM and then leveled
off. This observation is attributed to restricted motion of ADMQ somewhere
inside the protein scaffold and not in the aqueous phase.

anisotropy (r) of ADMQ with increasing
concentration of HSA. λex = 430 nm for ADMQ; λem = 550 nm; T = 298 K.

2.3 Identification of the ADMQ Binding Site in
HSA
Site-Specific Interaction Studies with Site Markers
To discern
the location of ADMQ in HSA, site-marker competitive experiments
were conducted. According to Sudlow’s nomenclature, warfarin
(War) and ibuprofen (Ibu) occupy the hydrophobic pockets41,42 and show affinity for binding site I (subdomain IIA) and binding
site II (subdomain IIIA), respectively.43 War binds in a stable fashion within subdomain IIA of SA,44,45 which is reflected by its enhanced fluorescence that arises as a
result of the close proximity of Trp-214 of HSA and its benzyl moiety.46,47

In this experiment, ADMQ was gradually added to a solution
with a fixed [HSA]:[site marker] concentration ratio of 1:1, and the
changes in the emission spectrum were monitored upon excitation at
295 nm. A decrease in the fluorescence intensity of HSA was observed,
accompanied by a hypsochromic shift from 345 to 340 nm (Figure S1). This observation reveals that there
is an increased nonpolar region in vicinity of Trp-214 and that ADMQ
addition somehow perturbs the site in which War is bound to HSA. On
the other hand, with Ibu there is just a decrease in fluorescence
intensity without any shift, indicating that Ibu is incapable of averting
ADMQ binding.

In order to quantify the extent of the binding
interaction of the
ADMQ–HSA complex in the absence and presence of the stereotypical
site markers, eq 2(48,49) was used, and the affinity constant (Ka) for ADMQ–HSA was found to be (4.85 ± 0.35) × 104 at 298 K and pH 7.4, whereas the values of Ka for ADMQ–HSA in the presence of Ibu and War were
(4.75 ± 0.29) × 104 and (4.20 ± 0.34) ×
104, respectively (Figure 5). It is prudent that the Ka dwindled upon War addition but remained similar to the original
value upon introduction of Ibu. The lower Ka of ADMQ toward HSA in the presence of War indicates that ADMQ competes
with War for the same site, i.e., site I of the protein. Hence, this
site-marker experiment indicates that the ligand ADMQ is localized
in subdomain IIA of serum albumin.

binding interaction in
the absence or presence of the site markers ibuprofen and warfarin
at 298 K. [HSA]:[site marker] = 1:1; λex = 295 nm; T = 298 K.

2.4 In Silico Investigation of the ADMQ Binding
Site in HSA
In order to substantiate the detailed in vitro
spectroscopic observations, a three-in-one molecular modeling exercise
was employed, involving regular extra-precision (XP) molecular docking,
induced-fit docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) to decipher the site-specific
interaction between the transport protein (HSA) and ADMQ.

Molecular
Docking
The arrangement and configuration
of ligands inside carrier proteins have a significant influence on
their conformational change and bioactivity under physiological conditions.50 The globular protein HSA is characterized primarily
by two sites I and II, each divided into two subdomains A and B.41,42 The key factors that hold importance for any ligand to bind to HSA
are its affinity, site specificity, and binding pose within the protein
pocket. Therefore, a complete picture of HSA and its interaction with
ADMQ can be better understood through computational studies.

ADMQ exists in different structural forms in different environments,
as shown in Scheme 1.40 In this scenario, a molecular docking
exercise was carried out with the β-hydroxy keto form of ADMQ.
Docking of the β-hydroxy keto form of ADMQ with HSA was performed
and compared with that of the site-specific marker warfarin (which
prefers to bind in subdomain IIA) by running the docking program Glide
to uncover their respective binding modes.

Scheme 1 Structural Changes
of ADMQ in Different Environments40
Glide searches for favorable
interactions between the ligand and
the receptor molecule, usually a protein, using the Optimized Potentials
for Liquid Simulations (OPLS) force field. The molecular docking study
of the ADMQ–HSA system suggests that the ligand prefers to
occupy Sudlow binding site I (subdomain IIA) of HSA where warfarin
resides, near Trp-214 (Figure 6). The hydrophobic, electrostatic, and H-bonding interactions
secure the ligand in the binding cleft of HSA in subdomain IIA. The
hydrophobic residues Trp-214, Leu-198, Ala-291, Val-343, Val-344,
Tyr-452, and Val-455 facilitate the binding inside the protein pocket.
A comparative picture of the docking scores and binding energies of
ADMQ and warfarin is documented in Table 3, indicating that ADMQ is stable while accommodating
itself in binding site I (BS I), in good agreement with site-specific
interaction studies in the presence of site markers.

proximity to ADMQ.

ligand	docking score (kcal mol–1)	MM-GBSA (kcal mol–1)	
warfarin	–6.0	–49.0	
ADMQ	–7.2	–74.8	
Induced-Fit Docking Study
This preliminary research
prompted further that a more sophisticated docking method like induced-fit
docking (IFD)51 had to be adopted to shed
light on the binding site, binding affinity, orientation, and binding
pose of the ligand and receptor. IFD uses Glide and the refinement
module in Prime to induce adjustments in the receptor structure so
that it can accommodate the ligand as per its geometry and orientation.
The receptor here also is untrimmed but a softened one compared with
the standard virtual docking study, in which the receptor is kept
rigid.

From the IFD studies, it can be judged that the minimum-energy
conformation of ADMQ prefers to acquire an arclike shape with a dihedral
angle of 113.8° within the hydrophobic pocket with slight structural
perturbations in the receptor site and is characterized by an IFD
score of −1283.42 kcal mol–1. Trp-214 is
also found to lie in close proximity to ADMQ (estimated distance of
∼1.97 nm), as depicted in Figure 7 left. The IFD-generated pose depicts that
the hydroxyl group of ADMQ forms H-bonds with Trp-214 and Asp-451,
whereas the nitrogen atom of the quinoline moiety forms a H-bond with
Arg-222. The two-dimensional 2D ligand interaction pattern (Figure 7 right) depicts the
predominance of hydrophobic amino acids (apple-green balls) in proximity
to the ADMQ molecule along with a few positively charged residues
like Arg-222, Arg-218, and Lys-195. Thus, several non-covalent interactions
shelter ADMQ within HSA.

interaction diagram depicting the amino acid residues and non-covalent
interactions.

MD Simulations
In order to analyze various features
of ADMQ–HSA binding (e.g., stability, types of interactions,
etc.) in explicit solvent under physiological conditions, MD simulations
were employed. Here the pose-scoring aspect of IFD was taken into
consideration, and out of the 12 poses that were generated, the ADMQ–HSA
conjugate pose with the highest IFD score (−1283.42 kcal mol–1) was taken for the next level of 15 ns MD simulation
by Desmond,52 an explicit-solvent program
with emphasis on accuracy, speed, and scalability. MD simulations
were used to gain an idea regarding the comparative stability of ADMQ
and warfarin inside the same binding pocket, as represented in terms
of root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation
(RMSF), secondary structure elements (SSEs), and protein–ligand
contacts. The RMSD for ADMQ–HSA is shown in Figure 8 while that for the warfarin–HSA
system is presented in Figure S2.

Figure 8 Plots of HSA
and ligand (ADMQ) RMSDs during 15 ns simulation.

The RMSD plot illustrates that ADMQ stays in its primary
binding
pocket and remains in contact with the protein chain without diffusing
away into the solvent. The RMSD change during the complete 15 ns run
lies within the 1–3 Å range, which shows that the system
has equilibrated and the RMSD has stabilized around fixed values in
both the case of ADMQ and warfarin.

The RMSF plot presents peaks
that are indicative of those regions
of the protein that have undergone maximum fluctuations. The RMSF
changes throughout the run were found to be similar in the cases of
ADMQ (Figure 9) and
warfarin (Figure S3). Inspection of the
peak fluctuations reveals how similar side chains of the protein have
undergone fluctuations with both ADMQ and warfarin. The agreement
between the protein RMSD and protein RMSF is found to be excellent,
which concretizes our observation that the probable binding site of
ADMQ is site IIA (the warfarin binding site). Moreover, the SSE distributions
by residue index for ADMQ (Figure 10) and warfarin (Figure S4) throughout HSA can be attributed to similar changes in α-helix
percentage to the tune of 57.24% for ADMQ and 57.72% for warfarin.

HSA and ligand (ADMQ) RMSF during 15 ns simulation.

protein
(HSA) structure during the course of 15 ns simulation.

The SSE compositions for each trajectory frame
for ADMQ on HSA
(Figure 11) and warfarin
on HSA (Figure S5) were also found to be
similar, along with analogous changes in α-helix. The findings
signify that subdomain IIA undergoes similar changes when ADMQ and
warfarin are incorporated at the same site. Hence, this comprehensive
in silico exercise provides insight into the binding location, affinity,
stability, and orientation pattern of the bioactive ligand ADMQ inside
the HSA scaffold.

residue over time.

2.5 Precise
Control over Rotamerization of Trp-214
Modulation of the Excited-State
Dynamics of Trp-214 by ADMQ
HSA is prone to continuous wobbling
motion, and so is its sole
Trp residue, Trp-214. In its natural habitat, HSA exhibits three lifetime
components,53 each representing a specific
ground-state conformer of Trp with lifetimes of 1.1 ns (τ1), 3.96 ns (τ2), and 7.32 ns (τ3). These three Trp rotamers are denoted as conformer I, conformer
II, and conformer III, respectively.22 The
disparity in the lifetimes of the three conformers in native HSA itself
signifies their relative exposure to the microenvironment. The shortest
and intermediate lifetimes reflect a degree of quenching for certain
Trp conformers due to the rigidity of the Trp microenvironment,54 whereas the longest lifetime represents a “free”
conformer of Trp.54 Hence, a longer lifetime
(conformer III) corresponds to greater exposure of the conformer to
the aqueous microenvironment, and a shorter lifetime (conformers I
and II) indicates exposure of the conformer toward a less polar environment
and its burial deep inside, away from the influence of bulk water.
When HSA is subjected to increasing ADMQ concentrations (Figure 12), the lifetimes
of the conformers are affected differently (the data are pooled in Table 4). τ3 remains almost unaltered throughout
the entire concentration range, indicating that it is unlikely that
ADMQ interacts with conformer III. For conformer II having an intermediate
lifetime, τ2 shows a marginal variation and decreases
from 3.96 to 3.56 ns. The lifetime of conformer I, τ1 decreases markedly from 1.1 to 0.52 ns, which is nearly a 50% reduction
relative to its initial value.

Another interesting observation
is the profound transformation
in the percentage contributions of these three rotamers in HSA with
increasing ADMQ concentration. The percentage contributions dwindle
radically for both conformer II and III from 34.64 to 3.82% and 38.82
to 1.50%, respectively. However, for conformer I the reverse situation
applies, as the percentage contribution mounts from 26.54% to a very
large value of 94.68% (Figure 13). The change triggered in the relative percentage
contributions and fluorescence decays of the three rotamers/microconformations
of Trp (in concentration-dependent ADMQ binding to HSA) points toward
ADMQ-induced perturbations of the Trp-214 neighborhood. This disposition
also points out the fact that ADMQ does exhibit precise control over
the rotamerization of Trp-214. This control over the rotamerization
process may be due to conformational alteration in HSA, direct interaction
between ADMQ and Trp-214, or both.

Figure 13 Percentage contributions of the three
rotamers in native HSA with
increasing [ADMQ] at 298 K. λex = 280 nm; λem = 340 nm; pH 7.4.

To understand the effect of changing pH on the conformational
transformation
of HSA, the fluorescence lifetime parameters (lifetime and pre-exponential
value) were monitored carefully as the ADMQ concentration was increased
in the HSA environment at different pH at 298 K. The changes in lifetime
values as well as in pre-exponential factors throughout the pH range
under study (Figures S7–S10) are
very similar to those reported at physiological pH.

2.6 Verification of Conformational Alteration
in HSA upon ADMQ Adoption
Binding of any exogenous ligand
to serum albumin may induce an alteration in the conformation and
three-dimensional (3D) structure of the host macromolecule. The drug-induced
conformational change, if major, may affect the biochemical/biological
activity of the protein itself6 because
maintaining the active site in the proper configuration is the cardinal
function of the protein structure, and thus, a minimal conformational
change may be highly appreciated. The conformational flexibility and
adaptability exhibited by a protein to interact with a drug molecule
is known to influence the transport mechanism of any drug in the physiological
microenvironment. Hence, the ADMQ-induced conformational alteration
in HSA was further investigated by circular dichroism (CD) and 3D
fluorescence spectroscopy.

Verification by CD Spectroscopy
Far-UV circular dichroism
in the range of 200–260 nm was measured to observe alterations
(if any) in the secondary structure of the host protein to accommodate
the newly synthesized ADMQ molecule at increasing concentration. The
dichroic absorption bands for α-helix, β-sheet (parallel
and antiparallel), β-turn, and random coil content were documented
for the addition of ADMQ to HSA. The CD spectrum of HSA manifests
itself with two signature absorption bands at 208 and 222 nm, characteristic
of α-helices.55 Upon gradual addition
of ADMQ, the decrease in the ellipticities at 208 and 222 nm (Figure 14) indicates an
increase in the negative Cotton effect, which reveals slight changes
in the secondary structure of HSA.

Figure 14 CD spectra of HSA alone and the ADMQ–HSA
complex at 298
K and pH 7.4. [HSA] = 2.5 μM; curves A through F correspond
to [ADMQ] = 0, 2.85, 7.32, 21.19, 39.27, and 58.01 μM.

The CD results also indicate that
upon addition of ADMQ to free
HSA, the antiparallel β-sheet structure rises from 2.30% to
3.30%, the parallel β-sheet arrangement from 2.70% to 3.50%,
the β-turn structure from 11.10 to 12.50%, and the random coil
structure from 13.00 to 15.50%. Moreover, the α-helical content
shows a reduction from 73% (free HSA) to 63.70% (ADMQ–HSA complex),
as shown in Figure 14. This diminution in the percentage of α-helices (∼10%)
upon introduction of ADMQ is indicative of minor conformational alterations
in HSA. The observation that the CD spectrum of free HSA overlapped
with the spectrum of the ADMQ–HSA complex suggests that HSA
in complex with ADMQ is predominantly α-helical with very little
change in the relative quantities of each component, as mentioned
above. This indicates that binding of ADMQ may have caused the polypeptide
chain to become slightly more tender in order to accommodate the ligand
inside the protein pocket. This meager decrement in the percentage
of α-helices may not render HSA inactive but may have some effect
on the rotamerization of Trp-214.

Verification by 3D Fluorescence
Spectroscopy
To gain
more insight into the ADMQ-rendered alteration in the polypeptide
backbone of HSA, 3D fluorescence measurements were also performed
on free HSA and in presence of increasing concentrations of ADMQ.
The 3D fluorescence spectra and contour diagrams for native HSA and
the ADMQ–HSA complex are presented in Figure 15.

Figure 15 3D fluorescence spectra and corresponding contour
diagrams of (A)
free HSA and (B) the ADMQ–HSA system in 10 mM HEPES buffer
(pH 7.4) at 298 K. [HSA] = 2.48 × 10–6 mol
dm–3.

In the 3D spectra, peak a (λex = λem) corresponds to Rayleigh scattering. Additionally, two peaks
designated
as peak 1 (λex = 295 nm) and peak 2 (λex = 235 nm) are also observed.56,57 Peak 1 is
characterized as the fluorescent tryptophan residue in HSA and reflects
changes in the tertiary structure of the protein, whereas peak 2 is
indicative of changes in the secondary structure of the protein upon
addition of ADMQ. The decreasing trends in the fluorescence intensity
for both peak 1 (27%) and peak 2 (25%) individually with increasing
ADMQ concentration point toward microenvironmental changes along with
slight alterations of the peptide strand (secondary structure) and
overall tertiary structure of the host protein. Hence, both CD and
3D fluorescence spectroscopy establish minimal conformational alteration
of the host HSA to accommodate the potential bioactive ADMQ molecule.
Hence, at this juncture it may be inferred that this minor conformational
alteration may also be conducive to Trp-214 rotamerization.

2.7 Verification of a Direct Interaction between
ADMQ and Trp-214
The relative distribution of the Trp microconformers
in HSA can be regulated by ADMQ only when a direct interaction is
possible between them. Hence, it was necessary to determine whether
these two partners are close enough to each other to achieve an effective
dynamic interaction.

Determination of the Proximity between Trp-214
and ADMQ
In connection with the possibility of the direct
interaction of ADMQ
with Trp-214, Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements
were performed for the ADMQ–HSA system to investigate the distance-dependent
energy transfer between the donor (HSA) and acceptor (ADMQ) in the
biological microenvironment.58 Energy transfer
occurs when the absorption spectrum of the acceptor molecule overlaps
with the emission spectrum of the donor.59 This spectral overlap between the interacting partners is depicted
in Figure 16. The
efficiency of energy transfer between the donor and acceptor can be
estimated from the photoluminescence quenching using the Förster
equation:60 5  where E is the efficiency, r is the distance between the
donor and acceptor, and R0 is the distance
at which the energy transfer
becomes 50%, which can be calculated as 6  where K2 is the
dipole orientation factor for the donor and acceptor, φD is the fluorescence quantum yield of the donor in the absence
of acceptor, n is the refractive index, and J is the spectral overlap integral, expressed as18 7  For ADMQ and HSA, εa = 7.49
× 103 M–1 cm–1 (at 430 nm), n = 1.37, and φD =
0.15. From eqs 5–7, the evaluated values are J = 4.80
× 1013 M–1 cm–1 nm4, R0 = 2.21 nm, E = 0.3574, and r = 2.45 nm. The obtained
value of r lies within 2–8 nm scale and satisfies
the condition 0.5R0 < r < 1.5R0, which implies the existence
of energy transfer between HSA and ADMQ. The distance between Trp-214
and ADMQ (r = 2.45 nm) is analogous with the result
of the IFD study (Figure 7a).

Figure 16 Spectral overlap of ADMQ absorption (black) and HSA fluorescence
(blue). The shaded region depicts the actual overlap of the two spectra.

2.8 Control
Experiment with Warfarin and Ibuprofen
ADMQ occupies a similar
protein scaffold as the site marker warfarin,
i.e., subdomain IIA of BS I in proximity to Trp-214 of HSA. Thus,
a control experiment was also performed with same anticoagulant warfarin
to see its effect on the three conformers of tryptophan. The addition
of warfarin to HSA resulted in an increase in the percentage of the
short-lifetime rotamer (conformer I) from 26.19 to 72.69% and precisely
points toward similar changes in the Trp-214 microenvironment (Figure 17).

Figure 17 Change in percentage
contribution of conformer 1 in native HSA
with increasing ADMQ (-■-), warfarin (-●-), and ibuprofen
(-▲-) at 298 K. λex = 280 nm; λem = 340 nm.

This observation inclines
toward the fact that ADMQ and warfarin
exhibit similar effects on the carrier protein in subdomain IIA (BS
I) and have similar control over the rotamerization of Trp-214. Interestingly,
performing the same experiment with another stereotypical ligand,
ibuprofen (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug), which binds to
subdomain IIIA (BS II) in the cleft/pocket, remote from vicinity of
Trp-214, did not bring out the same picture. Upon gradual addition
of ibuprofen to HSA at physiological pH, the percentage contribution
of conformer I varied meagerly from 31.91 to 40.5%, which indicates
that ibuprofen does not interfere with the microconformer (conformer
I) that is buried deep inside the pocket of subdomain IIA and does
not control rotamerization of Trp-214, as observed in case of ADMQ
and warfarin. Hence, from the proximity determination and control
experiments in presence of site markers, it may be concluded that
although ADMQ exerts a minor conformational perturbation on the polypeptide
backbone,the change in rotamerization of Trp-214 is mainly influenced
by direct interaction of ADMQ with Trp-214, as they reside in close
proximity to each other (2.45 nm).

3 Conclusion
The present comprehensive study enlightens a coherent flow of the
binding affinity, location, and spatial structural changes induced
in HSA by a newly synthesized quinoline-appended anthracenyl chalcone,
ADMQ, as shown by several in vitro spectroscopic techniques combined
with molecular modeling exercises. The site-marker competitive assay
in conjunction with the three-in-one molecular modeling approach generated
comparable profiles in terms of binding location for ADMQ and the
standard site marker warfarin in the HSA scaffold. ADMQ is enveloped
inside the hydrophobic domain (BS I, subdomain IIA) of HSA via hydrophobic
interactions with Trp-214, Arg-218, Arg222, Asp451, Tyr452, etc. Our
quest provides salutary quantitative data not only on how the dynamic
behavior of ADMQ with Trp-214 is manifested via the FRET mechanism
but also on how the molecule has shown its ability to regulate the
subpopulations of different Trp-214 rotamers. Although ADMQ exerts
a minimal conformational perturbation in the polypeptide backbone
of HSA, its direct interaction with the closely spaced Trp-214 (r = 2.45 nm) is found to predominantly regulate/control
the interconversion of discrete intrinsic fluorophore microconformations.
This in vitro spectroscopy amalgamated with in silico molecular modeling
exercise elucidates the use of the newly synthesized quinolinyl chalcone
having a regulatory effect on the rotamers of sole Trp-214 and its
site-specific binding interaction with the model transport protein
HSA. This may be very useful to understand the detailed mechanistic
and functional effects that chalcone-based therapeutic agents exert
on the distribution of rotameric forms of Trp in the human circulatory
system.

4 Experimental Details
4.1 Materials
The ligand ADMQ used for
the present study was synthesized previously by our group as described
elsewhere.40 HSA and warfarin were procured
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, U.S.). Ibuprofen was purchased
from Bangalore Fine Chemicals (Bangalore, India). HEPES buffer (extra-pure
99%) was procured from Sisco Research Laboratories (SRL) Pvt. Ltd.
(Mumbai, India).

A concentrated stock solution of HSA and warfarin
was prepared in HEPES buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4). A stock solution of
ADMQ and ibuprofen was prepared in 1,4-dioxane (Fisher Scientific,
spectroscopic grade).

4.2 Instrumentation
4.2.1 Absorption Spectroscopy
UV absorption
spectra were recorded at room temperature using a V-630 UV/vis spectrophotometer
from JASCO Deutschland GmbH and quartz cuvettes with a path length
of 1 cm.

4.2.2 Steady-State Fluorescence
Spectroscopy
A JASCO FP-8300 spectrofluorimeter with a spectral
resolution of
2.5 nm was used for steady-state excitation and emission measurement
with 1 cm path length cuvettes. The excitation wavelength of 295 nm
was chosen to measure the emission from the sole Trp residue in HSA.
Spectral corrections were carried out by subtracting appropriate blanks
from the sample spectra run under the same conditions. Samples were
equilibrated for 10 min at a particular temperature before data acquisition.
All of the fluorescence intensities were corrected for the inner-filter
effect using the following expression:61,62  where Fo and Fc are the observed and corrected fluorescence
intensities, respectively, and Aem and Aex are the absorbances at the wavelength of
emission and wavelength of excitation, respectively. In the site-marker
competitive experiments using the fluorescence titration method, backgrounds
of warfarin and ibuprofen were subtracted before data analysis.

4.2.3 Steady-State Fluorescence Anisotropy
The steady-state fluorescence anisotropy measurements were carried
out on a JASCO FP-8300 spectrofluorimeter at 298 K with manual control
of the parallel and perpendicular polarizers. The fluorescence anisotropy
(r) is expressed as18  where Ex90/Em90 and
Ex0/Em0 are vertical and horizontal excitation/emission
polarizers, respectively. The value of G is formulated
as18  

4.2.4 Circular Dichroism Measurements
A JASCO J-815 CD spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc., Easton, MI) was
used to record the spectra at 298 K with a rectangular quartz cuvette
with a path length of 1 cm. An average of three successive scans was
made for each CD spectrum at a rate of 20 nm/min over the wavelength
range from 200 to 260 nm. The HSA concentration was kept constant
(2.5 μM) while the ADMQ concentration was varied. The CD results
were expressed as mean residual ellipticity (MRE) in units of deg
cm2 dmol–1:  where Cp is the
molar concentration of protein, n is the number of
amino acid residues (585 for HSA), and l is the path
length (1 cm). The α-helical content was estimated from the
MRE value at 208 nm using the following expression:  where MRE208 is the observed MRE
value at 208 nm. The MRE value of 4000 corresponds to the β-form
and random coils, whereas the MRE value of 33000 is for pure α-helix
at 208 nm.

4.2.5 Fluorescence Lifetime
Measurements
Time-resolved fluorescence decays were measured
using the time-correlated
single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique with a PTI Pico Master instrument.
A pulsed diode with a wavelength of 280 nm was used as the excitation
source for HSA. The instrument response function (IRF) was acquired
using sodium dodecyl sulfate as a scatterer. The decays and pre-exponential
values obtained at an emission wavelength of 340 nm were analyzed
using FelixGX 4.1.2 software. The reduced χ2 value
and Durbin–Watson parameter were used to authenticate the goodness
of fit. The lifetime data were acquired with similar parameters at
pH 2, 4, 9, and 11 using sodium acetate and disodium hydrogen orthophosphate
buffers with increasing ADMQ concentration in the HSA environment.

4.3 In Silico Studies
The molecular modeling
studies were conducted using an Intel core i5–2500 CPU running
at a clock speed of 3.3 GHz. The 64-bit processors were coupled with
4 GB of high-speed RAM while using Maestro version 9.9 (Schrödinger
LLC, New York, 2014). The machines were operated by the Linux Centos
6 operating system.

4.3.1 Ligand and Protein Preparation
The synthesized ligand ADMQ was prepared in Maestro 9.9 over the
LigPrep module63−65 using the OPLS-2005 force field66,67 for rectification of molecular geometries and subsequent ionization
at a physiological pH of 7.4, thereby enabling specific chirality
retention in order to obtain a conformation with minimum energy. HSA
(PDB ID 1AO6)68,69 was prepared using the Protein Preparation
Wizard (Schrödinger).70,71 The HSA model prepared
in this fashion may be considered reliable as it closely resembles
the native 3D structure. Finally, the whole HSA structure was minimized
by convergence to an RMSD of 0.3 Å with the OPLS force field.

4.3.2 Regular XP Molecular Docking and Induced-Fit
Docking
The site map module was used to identify possible
binding sites in the fully processed protein. The main purpose of
the docking exercise was to generate a list of feasible binding sites
that could finally lead to a stable protein–ligand complex
considering the penalty scores and other short-range interactions.
Subsequently, the best ligand conformation having the lowest penalty
score was considered for further analysis. The ligand was docked at
the selected sites using the XP mode of Glide.63 The stability of the ligand–protein complex was
depicted by molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA)
binding energy values. Flexible docking was performed using induced
fit docking.51

4.3.3 MD
Simulations
Desmond MD System
v2.2 (D. E. Shaw Research, Schrödinger)66,72 was used to perform MD simulations. The TIP3P solvation model was
configured to an orthorhombic box shape. Neutralization of the ions
was carried out by introducing Na+ salt. To minimize the
solvated ligand–receptor complex, 2000 iterations were carried
out. The simulation was carried out for 15 ns. The overall method
for MD simulation was adopted as reported earlier6 for the ADMQ–BSA system.
