Sharp narrow nanopetal-like and wrinkled
nanoball-like cubic Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4-implanted orthorhombic
Bi2S3-capped anatase TiO2 heterostructures
have been synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal process in acidic
and basic environments. They have been characterized by high-resolution
scanning and transmission electron microscopies, energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy, selected area electron and powder X-ray diffractometries,
vibrating sample magnetometry, UV–visible diffuse reflectance
and photoluminescence spectroscopies, and nitrogen adsorption–desorption
analysis. Both the nanostructured composites are superparamagnetic.
While the nanocomposite synthesized in acidic environment absorbs
in the entire visible and UV spectral regions, the absorption edge
of nanocomposite obtained in basic environment narrowly misses the
red end of the visible spectrum. The emission spectra of both the
nanomaterials are strikingly similar, indicating similar crystal defects
in anatase TiO2 lattice of both the nanocomposites. Although
both the nanocomposites degrade dye under visible light, the photocatalytic
activity of the sample obtained in acidic environment is superior
to that prepared in basic condition. The enhanced photocatalytic activity
of the nanocomposite synthesized in acidic environment is rationalized
in terms of nanostructure, surface area, and optical properties.

Introduction
Population growth with enhanced per capita
purchasing power in
developing countries exerts pressure on the per capita availability
of safe water. Water pollution due to industrial effluents and domestic
sewage is a common occurrence in such territories. Semiconductor-photocatalytic
mineralization of organic pollutants is an emerging technology to
treat industrial effluents and domestic sewage; it requires no chemical
but only air and a semiconductor photocatalyst, where the latter is
recoverable for reuse. TiO2 is a cheap, nontoxic, stable,
industrially manufactured n-type semiconductor with
unique optoelectronic properties,1 and
its use as a self-cleaning material has turned commercial.2 Its band gap is ca. 3.2 eV and requires UV light
radiation of wavelength less than 390 nm for photoactivation. The
UV light in the natural sunlight that reaches the earth surface is
only about 4% of the total solar energy incident on earth. The sunlight
shining on the earth surface is 1000 W m–2, and
the UV light contribution is only 40 W m–2.3 Hence, development of photocatalytic materials
that absorb visible light of the solar radiation is of interest;4−8 the requirement of artificial light is bypassed cutting the cost and the technology could be used
in remote rural areas where availability of electricity is restricted.
Bi2S3 is an n-type narrow-band-gap
(ca. 1.3 eV) semiconductor. It is black and absorbs all UV and visible
light. Furthermore, it has a high absorption coefficient (ca. 104–105 cm–1) and reasonable
incident photon to electron conversion efficiency.9 Visible light photocatalytic mineralization of organic
pollutants by nanostructured Bi2S3 is well established.10,11 TiO2 could be sensitized and enabled to absorb light
of longer wavelength, by coupling with a narrow-band-gap semiconductor
such as Bi2S3. Bi2S3/TiO2 heterojunction enhances charge separation, and nanocrystalline
Bi2S3/TiO2 shows improved photocurrent
(J) with visible light.12 Further, Bi2S3 nanoparticle/TiO2 nanotube heterostructure, fabricated by hydrothermal treatment,
shows superior photoelectrochemical property to that of Bi2S3 and TiO2, all under sunlight at AM 1.5 (100
mW cm–2).13 Visible light
photocatalytic degradation of pollutants by Bi2S3/TiO2 heterojunction obtained by precipitation method14,15 or through hydrothermal treatment16 and
by Bi2S3 balls/TiO2 nanotube arrays17 have been reported. Defect-free interfaces in
Bi2S3/TiO2 nanorod–nanoparticle
heterostructures favor electron–hole separation and transfer,
exhibiting improved photocatalytic activity under visible light.18 Bi2S3/TiO2 heterojunction
could be tailored to generate hydrogen; Bi2S3 nanowire @ TiO2 nanorod heterostructure photoelectrochemically
generates hydrogen under visible light.9 Recovery of the photocatalytic nanomaterials after mineralization
of pollutants is a challenge for adoption of this technology by industries
or domestic sewage treatment plants. Magnetic nanocore inside photocatalytic
nanomaterial enables magnetic separation feasible.19−23 The buried magnetic core enables recovery of the
magnetic photocatalyst nanoparticles through application of a magnetic
field. The implanted magnetic nanocore is completely wrapped by the
photocatalytic semiconductor, and this isolation forbids any physical
contact between the magnetic core and pollutant molecules. The absence
of magnetic core at the photocatalyst–effluent interface renders
photocorrosion of the core impossible. With this in mind, we synthesized,
through a two-step process, Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4-implanted Bi2S3-capped
TiO2 nanostructures in acidic and basic environments, for
application as magnetically retrievable visible light photocatalyst
for environmental remediation. We used carbon microsphere, prepared
by solvothermal carbonization of glucose,24 as a templating agent for first-stage synthesis, prior to Bi2S3-capping.

Results and Discussion
Morphology
The
high-resolution scanning electron microscopy
(HRSEM) images of the samples synthesized in (i) acidic environment,
Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (A) and (ii) basic environment,
Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (B), are presented in Figure 1 under different
magnifications. The nanocomposite obtained in acidic environment takes
the form of narrow nanopetals while that prepared in basic environment
appears to be wrinkled nanoballs. As the synthetic procedures adopted
differ only by the addition of an acid (nitric acid) or a base (triethanol
amine), it is concluded that the acidic or basic environment determines
the morphology of the nanocomposite. However, it is pertinent to state
that the morphology of electrochemically synthesized fungus-like mesoporous
Bi2S3 ball/TiO2 nanotube arrays (balls
with wrinkled surface)17 is similar to
that of the sample synthesized in the present work in basic environment.
The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images
of the samples prepared in acidic and basic environments are displayed
in Figure 2. The nanocomposite
obtained in acidic environment appears to be sharp, narrow, and petal-like
in nanodimension. The sample prepared in basic environment looks like
a nanolump with nanorods buried inside.

(b) environments.

Crystalline Structure
The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) images of the samples synthesized in acidic and basic environments
are presented in Figure 3. They show the presence of copper, zinc, iron, titanium, bismuth,
sulfur, and oxygen, thus confirming the presence of the constituent
elements of the obtained nanomaterials. The absence of any other element
indicates the purity of the synthesized materials. The powder X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns of precursor copper zinc ferrite and the
nanocomposites synthesized in acidic and basic environments are shown
in Figure 4. The XRD
pattern of copper zinc ferrite matches that of cubic Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4 lattice with a unit cell
length of 0.8419 nm. The diffraction peaks at 29.9, 35.2, 42.9, 56.6,
and 62.3° index to 2 2 0-, 3 1 1-, 4 0 0-, 5 1 1-, and 4 4 0-planes,
respectively (JCPDS card no. 89-7409). The XRD pattern of the sample
obtained in acidic environment displays the 3 1 1- and 4 4 0-reflections
of cubic Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4, and that of the nanocomposite prepared in basic environment shows
the 3 1 1-peak of cubic Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4, thereby confirming the presence of cubic Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4 lattice in both the samples.
While the XRD pattern of nanocomposite synthesized in acidic environment
displays the 1 1 0- and 2 0 4-peaks of anatase TiO2 at
33.5 and 62.7°, respectively, that of the sample obtained in
basic environment exhibits 1 0 1-, 1 0 5-, and 2 1 1-reflections of
anatase TiO2 at 25.3, 53.9, and 55.1°, respectively
(JCPDS no. 89-4203). These reflections show the presence of anatase
TiO2 in both the nanocomposites. A large number of reflections
of orthorhombic Bi2S3 (JCPDS no. 84–0279)
are observed in the XRD pattern of nanocomposite synthesized in acidic
environment, but the XRD pattern of the sample prepared in basic environment
shows only the 1 2 1- and 1 2 2-peaks of orthorhombic Bi2S3. These results confirm the presence of Bi2S3 orthorhombic lattice in both the samples. The selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the samples obtained
in acidic and basic environments are displayed in Figure 5. Like the XRDs, the SAEDs
also differ, although they show the presence of cubic Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4, anatase TiO2, and orthorhombic Bi2S3 lattices in the nanocomposites.
The reflection spots of the 4 4 4-plane of cubic Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4, 1 1 3-plane of anatase TiO2, and 1 1 0-, 1 0 2-, 1 2 2-, 0 6 1-, and 1 5 6-planes of
orthorhombic Bi2S3 are observed in the SAED
pattern of nanocomposite prepared in acidic environment. The SAED
pattern of the sample obtained in basic environment displays diffraction
lines of 2 2 0-, 2 2 2, and 4 4 0-planes of cubic Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4, 1 0 1-, 1 0 3-, and
2 0 0-planes of anatase TiO2 and 1 1 1-, 1 0 2-, 2 0 0-,
and 0 5 3-planes of orthorhombic Bi2S3 crystal
lattices. JCPDS cards 89-7409, 89-4203, and 84-0279 are the references
employed for indexing cubic Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4, anatase TiO2, and orthorhombic Bi2S3 lattices, respectively. The HRTEM images of
both the nanocomposites, at high resolution, display the lattice fringes
(Figure 6). The lattice
fringes of the sample obtained in acidic environment show the interplanar
distances of cubic Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4, anatase TiO2, and orthorhombic Bi2S3. The observed interplanar distances (d) of 0.55 and 0.32 nm correspond to 0 2 0- and 1 0 2-planes of orthorhombic
Bi2S3 (JCPDS card no. 84–0279), and the
measured 0.35 nm agrees with the d of 1 0 1-planes
of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS no. 89–4203). The d of the 2 2 0-planes of cubic Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4 (0.30 nm, JCPDS no. 89–7409) is
also observed in the HRTEM image. The corresponding images of the
nanocomposite synthesized in basic environment display the interplanar
distances of the 1 2 1-planes of orthorhombic Bi2S3 (0.31 nm) and the 3 1 1-planes of cubic Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4 (0.25 nm) lattices. Thus, EDS,
XRD, SAED, and lattice fringes confirm both the synthesized samples
as Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3.

Surface Characteristics
Catalytic activity of nanostructured
semiconductor is largely influenced by its surface characteristics,
which are evaluated through nitrogen adsorption process. The adsorptions
of nitrogen on both the nanocomposites are reversible, and Figure 7a presents the adsorption–desorption
loops. Both the adsorptions are of type II isotherms, which indicate
that the nanocomposites are nonporous. The isotherms represent unrestricted
monolayer–multilayer adsorption on Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (A)/(B). The specific surface areas of Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (A) and Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (B), determined by the
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, are 26.76 and 18.26
m2 g–1, respectively. The pore volumes
of the samples synthesized in acidic and basic environments are 0.071
and 0.057 cm3 g–1, respectively. The
pore sizes of Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (A) and Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (B), obtained by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) method, are 3.93 and 5.12 nm, respectively.

Superparamagnetism
Figure 7b presents the magnetization (M) of
Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (A) and Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (B) nanostructures as a function of applied field (H). The shape and size of the M–H curve are characteristic of the nanomaterials investigated,
and the displayed hysteresis loops are of normal S-shape. The hysteresis curves afford the saturation magnetization
(MS), coercivity (HC), and remanence magnetization (MR). The “thickness” of the S-shaped
loop at its middle shows the extent of hysteresis, which reflects
the coercivity. Both the M–H loops are normal S-shaped and indicate the superparamagnetism
of Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (A) and Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (B) nanostructures. The HC values of Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (A) and Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (B), as obtained from the hysteresis loops,
are 0.093 and 0.017 kOe, respectively. The very small coercivities
confirm the superparamagnetism of both the nanocomposites synthesized.
The MS values of Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (A) and Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (B), as
provided by the M–H curves,
are 0.27 and 0.66 emu g–1, respectively. The hysteresis
loops afford the MR values of Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (A) and Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (B)
as 0.014 and 0.005 emu g–1, respectively. The insignificant MR values further confirm both the synthesized
composite nanostructures as superparamagnetic.

Absorption
Band
gap excitation of semiconductor with
light of appropriate wavelength is the basis of semiconductor photocatalysis.
Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) enables to probe the band gaps
of semiconducting nanomaterials. Figure 7c shows the DRS of precursor Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4 nanocrystals and nanostructured
Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (A) and Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (B). The DRS displayed are in terms of F(R), obtained from the measured reflectance (R) applying the Kubelka–Munk algorithm: F(R) = (1 – R)2/2R. Although all of the stated nanomaterials show
visible light absorption, their absorption edges are different. While
the absorption edge of precursor Cu0.4Zn0.9Fe2O4 nanocrystals is not longer than 600 nm, the
composite nanostructure synthesized in acidic condition absorbs visible
and UV lights in the entire spectral range (200–800 nm). The
absorption edge is blue-shifted on switching from acidic to basic
environment while capping Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2 with Bi2S3.

Emission
Photogenerated electron–hole pairs
recombine predominantly, radiatively, nonradiatively, or by both processes,
thereby suppressing the photocatalytic efficiency of the semiconductor
nanocrystals.1 Photoluminescence study
enables to probe radiative recombination of photoproduced charge carriers.
The emission spectra of both the nanocomposites are presented in Figure 7d. Both the nanocomposites
exhibit strong blue-green emission at 483 nm and prominent green emission
centered around 522 nm. These two emissions stem from the TiO2 anatase lattice.25−29 They are assigned to the transition of doubly trapped and singly
trapped electrons in the oxygen vacancies to the valence band (VB)
of TiO2, respectively. The energy levels of the two types
of oxygen vacancies are, respectively, 0.51 and 0.82 eV lower than
those of the conduction band (CB) minimum. Because of the said energy
levels, the photoformed electrons in the CB readily slip over to the
two kinds of oxygen vacancies through nonradiative processes, and
this is followed by radiative combination of VB holes with the trapped
electrons in the two types of oxygen vacancies. Emission of fluorescence
at two wavelengths is the consequence of the radiative combinations
of electrons trapped at two energy levels with VB holes. The observed
bands in the visible region (at about 2.57 and 2.35 eV) are ascribed
to the radiative recombination of excitons of the shallow traps identified
with oxygen vacancies and Ti4+ adjacent to oxygen vacancies.
Band edge-free excitons and -bound excitons also give rise to blue-green
emission.26 The energy of green emission
corresponds to transition of electron from deep-level donor of the
ionized oxygen vacancies to the VB hole.26 The blue-green band is also attributed to charge-transfer transition
from Ti3+ to oxygen anion of TiO68– octahedra associated with oxygen vacancies at the surface.28 The blue-green bound excitation emission is
said to arise from trapping of free excitations near defects.28

Visible Light Photocatalysis
Photocatalytic
activities
of both the nanostructured composites are tested with visible light
employing methylene blue as the test substrate. Figure 8 displays the dye-degradation profile in
the presence of Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (A) or Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (B) under visible light illumination.
The dye-decay profiles demonstrate the visible light photocatalytic
activity of the title nanomaterials. In the absence of nanocomposites,
the dye remains undegraded. Reuse of the nanocomposites as photocatalysts
for dye degradation shows sustainable photocatalysis (tested up to
four cycles; data not presented). Copper zinc ferrite is buried in
TiO2 lattice, and the low-solubility product of Bi2S3 (Ks ∼ 10–97) confers
chemical stability down to pH ∼ 1.14 Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4 in cubic
lattice, TiO2 in anatase phase, and Bi2S3 in orthorhombic crystalline state are the crystal lattices
present in both the synthesized nanocomposites. Nanocrystalline Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4 absorbs in the
wavelength region 600–200 nm. However, it is unlikely to be
responsible for the observed photocatalytic activity of the synthesized
nanocomposites. This is because it is implanted in anatase TiO2 lattice; Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4 is completely wrapped by TiO2 lattice. TiO2 capped with Bi2S3 fully shields the
implanted Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4 from the illuminated light. The band gap of anatase TiO2 is about 3.2 eV, and hence no way it is responsible for visible
light photocatalysis. Orthorhombic Bi2S3 (black
in color) absorbs in the entire visible spectrum (besides the UV light);
its band gap is about 1.3 eV only. The visible light photoexcites
Bi2S3 in the nanocomposites; electrons are promoted
from VB to CB of Bi2S3. The CB potential of
Bi2S3 is more negative than that of TiO2.3,12,13,15−17,30−32 This favors thermodynamically the movement of electron
from CB of Bi2S3 to CB of TiO2. However,
the VB potential of Bi2S3 is less positive than
that of TiO2. Hence, migration of hole from the VB of Bi2S3 to that of TiO2 is energetically
forbidden. Thus, the photogenerated electron–hole pairs are
separated across the Bi2S3/TiO2 heterojunction
(Figure 9). The hole
in the VB of Bi2S3 picks up an electron from
the surface-adsorbed hydroxyl ion or water molecule generating the
reactive oxidizing species (ROS), HO•. The CB electron
migrated to TiO2 jumps to the oxygen molecule adsorbed
on TiO2 lattice affording superoxide radical ion (O2•−), which through a series of reactions
affords ROS. The ROS are responsible for the photocatalytic degradation
processes. Thus, in the synthesized 2D and 3D nanostructures, the
implanted Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4 serves as magnetic core, TiO2 functions as photocatalyst,
and the capped Bi2S3 acts as photosensitizer.
Further, the high optical absorption coefficient of Bi2S3 (∼105 cm–1) enables
effective absorption of light by the synthesized nanostructures.14 Photodegradation of methylene blue in the presence
of Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 nanostructures is unlikely a
dye-sensitized reaction. This proposition stems from the facts that
methylene blue degradation on Bi2S3 is a photocatalyzed
one33 and methyl orange33 and rhodamine B10,11 dyes are also photocatalytically
degraded by Bi2S3. Furthermore, Bi2S3-deposited TiO2 photocatalyzes degradation
of methyl orange,16,18 orange G,14 orange II,15 4-hydroxybenzoic
acid,15 and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid17 under visible light.

Figure 8 Photocatalytic dye-degradation
profiles under visible light (conditions
as given in Experimental Section).

Figure 9 Photocatalytic mechanism.

The photocatalytic activity of Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (A) is higher than that of Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (B)
(Figure 8). One of
the possible reasons is Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (A) is
a 2D nanomaterial, whereas Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (B)
is a 3D material and electron flow is directional and faster in 2D
than in 3D nanostructures. Besides the nanostructures, the specific
surface areas of the composites also determine the photocatalytic
activity. The specific surface area of Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (A) is larger (26.8 m2 g–1) than that
of Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (B) (18.7 m2 g–1) and hence the photocatalytic activity. The determined
pore volume is also in accordance with the measured photocatalytic
activity. More importantly, while Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (A) absorbs in the entire visible region and also UV radiation,
Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4/TiO2-Bi2S3 (B) fails to exhibit such optical
property. More is the light absorbed, higher is the photocatalytic
activity. Hence, the observed photocatalytic activities are on the
expected line.

Conclusions
Cubic copper zinc ferrite-implanted
orthorhombic Bi2S3-capped anatase TiO2 synthesized by hydrothermal
method in acidic and basic environments differ in their morphology;
while the former is a 2D nanocomposite, the latter is a 3D nanomaterial.
Although the emission spectra of both the materials are identical,
their XRD, micro- and nanostructures, magnetic properties, and absorption
spectra are different. The 2D nanomaterial obtained in acidic environment
shows higher visible light photocatalytic activity compared to the
3D nanomaterial prepared in basic condition. The differences in the
photocatalytic activities are rationalized in terms of the nanostructures,
light absorption, and surface area.

Experimental Section
Synthesis
Stage
1
Cu0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4 nanocrystals (50 mg, Sigma-Aldrich) were dispersed
in 10 mL of 2-propanol under sonication (20 min). To the resultant
dispersion, carbon microspheres (300 mg) were added and dispersed
by sonication (20 min); carbon microspheres were synthesized following
the procedure reported already.24 To the
resultant was added titanium isopropoxide (2 mL) dissolved in 20 mL
of 2-proponol and the mixture was stirred for an hour. This was followed
by the addition of 10 mL of 80% aqueous ethanol with stirring. The
obtained brown precipitate along with the supernatant liquid was transferred
to a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave vessel and heated at 150 °C
for 12 h. The contents were allowed to cool naturally. The solid was
separated by filtration, washed with water and ethanol several times,
dried at 60 °C for 6 h, and calcined at 400 °C for 2 h in
a muffle furnace equipped with a PID temperature controller. The heating
rate was 10 °C min–1.

Stage 2A
The solid
(200 mg) obtained in the first stage
of synthesis was dispersed in 20 mL of deionized distilled water under
sonication (20 min). To this was added 20 mL of aqueous solution of
Bi(NO3)3 (500 mg) and nitric acid (2 mL), and
the mixture was stirred for an hour. This was followed by the addition
of aqueous thiourea (1 g in 10 mL) under stirring. The resultant mixture
was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 150
°C for 12 h. The contents were cooled naturally. The solid was
collected by filtration, washed repeatedly with (i) water and (ii)
ethanol, and dried at 70 °C for 12 h.

Stage 2B
The solid
(200 mg) obtained in the first stage
of synthesis was dispersed in deionized distilled water (20 mL) through
sonication (20 mL). Bi(NO3)3 (500 mg) and triethanol
amine (4 mL) were dissolved in 20 mL of deionized distilled water
by stirring for an hour. This was added to the aqueous dispersion
of the solid particles obtained in the first stage of synthesis and
stirred for an hour. To the resultant was added aqueous thiourea (1
g in 10 mL) with stirring. The entire content was taken in a 100 mL
Teflon-coated autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 12 h. The autoclave
with content was allowed to cool naturally. The solid was separated
by filtration, washed many times with water and ethanol, and dried
at 70 °C for 12 h.

Characterization
High-resolution SEM images of the
synthesized samples were obtained using an FEI Quanta FEG 200 SEM.
A JEOL JEM 2100 HRTEM equipped with Gatan Orious CCD camera was used
to record the HRTEM images, SAED patterns, and EDS images of the samples.
The samples were dispersed on carbon-coated copper grids, and the
acceleration voltage applied was 200 kV. A PANalytical X’Pert
PRO diffractometer was used to record the powder XRD patterns. The
XRD patterns were obtained using Cu Kα rays of wavelength 0.15406
nm at 40 kV with a tube current of 30 mA in a 2θ range of 10–80°.
The magnetic properties of the materials were determined using a Lakeshore
7404 vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) at room temperature (25 °C).
A Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrometer with an ISR-2600 integrating sphere
attachment was used to record the UV–visible DRS images. The
photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the samples were recorded with a
PerkinElmer LS 55 fluorescence spectrometer at room temperature. The
nanoparticles were dispersed in carbon tetrachloride under sonication
and excited at 340 nm. A Micromeritics ASAP 2020 sorption analyzer
was employed to determine the specific surface areas (SSAs) of the
nanostructured composites. The nanomaterials were degassed at 150
°C for 12 h, and adsorption and desorption were carried out at
−195.56 °C with N2 as the adsorbate gas. The
SSAs were obtained by the BET multipoint method through a least-squares
fit. The pore volume and pore area were determined by the BJH method.

Photocatalytic Test
The visible light photocatalytic
activity was tested employing a 150 W tungsten halogen lamp fixed
into a double-walled borosilicate vessel with an inlet and outlet
for coolant circulation. Circulation of 2 M NaNO2 solution
cuts off 99% of UV light of wavelength 320–400 nm.34 Methylene blue was the test substrate used,
and its photodegradation was carried out in a wide cylindrical borosilicate
glass vessel of uniform diameter with an area of cross section 15.9
cm2. The distance between the light source and the dye
solution was 13 cm. The light intensity was measured with a Daystar
solar meter (415 W m–2). A freshly prepared dye
solution (100 mL) with 50 mg of photocatalyst was taken in the reaction
vessel and saturated with air using a micro-air pump. The airflow
rate was 7.8 mL s–1. The dissolved oxygen was measured
with an Elico-dissolved oxygen analyzer PE 135 (9.3 mg L–1). The pH measured was 5.5. Purging of air keeps the photocatalyst
particles afloat. After providing sufficient time for the completion
of adsorption of the dye on the catalyst surface, the vessel was illuminated.
At different times of illumination, a finite volume of the dye solution
was withdrawn and the undegraded dye was analyzed spectroscopically.
Absorption at 662 nm permits dye estimation.
