The manipulation of B800 bacteriochlorophyll
(BChl) a in light-harvesting complex 2 (LH2) from
the purple photosynthetic
bacterium Phaeospirillum molischianum (molischianum-LH2) provides insight for understanding
the energy transfer mechanism and the binding of cyclic tetrapyrroles
in LH2 proteins since molischianum-LH2 is one of
the two LH2 proteins whose atomic-resolution structures have been
determined and is a representative of type-2 LH2 proteins. However,
there is no report on the substitution of B800 BChl a in molischianum-LH2. We report the reconstitution
of 3-acetyl chlorophyll (AcChl) a, which has a 17,18-dihydroporphyrin
skeleton, to the B800 site in molischianum-LH2. The
3-acetyl group in AcChl a formed a hydrogen bond
with β′-Thr23 in essentially the same manner as native
B800 BChl a, but this hydrogen bond was weaker than
that of B800 BChl a. This change can be rationalized
by invoking a small distortion in the orientation of the 3-acetyl
group in the B800 cavity by dehydrogenation in the B-ring from BChl a. The energy transfer from AcChl a in
the B800 site to B850 BChl a was about 5-fold slower
than that from native B800 BChl a by a decrease of
the spectral overlap between energy-donating AcChl a and energy-accepting B850 BChl a.

Introduction
Photosynthetic light-harvesting
proteins are important in the primary
process of conversion of light energy into chemical energy in nature.
Chlorophyll (Chl) and bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) pigments play crucial
roles in photon capture and excitation energy transfer (EET) in light-harvesting
proteins.1−3 Chl pigments in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms
generally have a 17,18-dihydroporphyrin skeleton. BChls a, b, and g, which are major pigments
in purple photosynthetic bacteria and heliobacteria, consist of 7,8,17,18-tetrahydroporphyrin.
The difference in the degree of hydrogenation in the cyclic tetrapyrroles
between Chls and BChls is primarily responsible for the photofunctions
in light-harvesting proteins since the spectral coverage of (B)Chl
pigments and their physicochemical features of the lowest energy absorption
bands (Qy bands) depend on their cyclic
tetrapyrrole skeletons.1,4 Therefore, control of (de)hydrogenation
of cyclic tetrapyrrole pigments is a promising prospect for elucidating
the photofunctional mechanisms of light-harvesting proteins and improving
photoconversion efficiency in photosynthetic systems.

Light-harvesting
complex 2 (LH2) is favorable for manipulating
the cyclic tetrapyrrole pigments of photosynthetic proteins in the
investigation of the effects of (B)Chl structures with regard to their
photosynthetic functions. LH2 proteins are peripheral antennas in
purple photosynthetic bacteria. In these proteins, BChl a and carotenoids are circularly organized in the scaffold of transmembranous
α- and β-polypeptides (Figure 1A).5−7 Two types of BChl a pigments, denoted as B800 and B850 based on their peak positions
of Qy bands, are present in LH2 proteins.
B800 BChl a is located between the β-polypeptides
as the monomeric form. B850 BChl a pigments, which
are sandwiched between the α- and β-polypeptides, are
excitonically coupled with each other in their circular arrangement.
Excitation energy is efficiently transferred from B800 to B850 BChl a in LH2 proteins.8−10

are colored sky blue and orange, respectively. (C) Molecular structures
of BChl a (single bond between C7 and C8 atoms) and

LH2 proteins from Phaeospirillum (Phs.) molischianum and Rhodoblastus (Rbl.) acidophilus, denoted as molischianum-LH2 and acidophilus-LH2, are the representative
LH2 of purple photosynthetic bacteria since the three-dimensional
structures of only these two LH2 proteins are available at atomic-level
resolutions5−7 and LH2 proteins from various purple bacteria are
classified based on their spectral properties into two types: type-1
LH2 (acidophilus-LH2 like) and type-2 LH2 (molischianum-LH2 like).11 Therefore, molischianum-LH2 and acidophilus-LH2 are
key proteins to comprehensively understand the structural and functional
principles of LH2 proteins.

The binding pockets of B800 BChl a in LH2 have
attracted considerable attention for demonstrating the importance
of cyclic tetrapyrrole structures on (B)Chl binding and intracomplex
EET in photosynthetic proteins. From these viewpoints, the reconstitution
of (B)Chl derivatives into the B800 cavity in LH2 proteins from two
purple bacteria, Rbl. acidophilus and Rhodobacter (Rba.) sphaeroides, has been scrutinized.12−22 Recently, in situ structural conversion of (B)Chls in the B800 site
in acidophilus-LH2 has also been reported.23,24 However, no report exists on the exchange of B800 BChl a to other chlorophyllous pigments in molischianum-LH2 because of the difficulty of B800 removal from this protein.
Nevertheless, we have recently succeeded in the selective removal
of B800 BChl a from molischianum-LH2.25 This work allows us to examine
the reconstitution of chlorophyllous pigments into the B800 cavity
in molischianum-LH2. The structure in the proximity
of B800 BChl a in molischianum-LH2
is shown in Figure 1B.

Pigment substitution in LH2 proteins is of interest from
the viewpoint
of biohybrid approaches for enrichments of the original photofunctions
of photosynthetic proteins. Indeed, chemical modification of photosynthetic
proteins with artificial chromophores can extend their light-harvesting
range and improve the photofunctions.26−33 Such biohybrid engineering will be helpful for the development of
photoconversion systems using or mimicking photosynthetic apparatus.34−36

In this study, we report the reconstitution of 3-acetyl Chl
(AcChl) a into the B800 site in molischianum-LH2
and the characterization of spectroscopic properties and energy transfer
dynamics of the reconstituted protein. AcChl a (Figure 1C) is obtained from
BChl a by the oxidation of the B-ring in its cyclic
tetrapyrrole. Therefore, the peripheral substituents in AcChl a are the same as BChl a; the structural
difference between AcChl a and BChl a is restricted to the degree of hydrogenation in the B-ring of the
cyclic tetrapyrroles. In spite of the small structural difference
between AcChl a and BChl a, the Qy band of AcChl a at 677 nm
is largely shifted to a shorter wavelength than that of BChl a at 770 nm in acetone. AcChl a is thus
suitable to change the photofunctions of LH2 proteins by its reconstitution
into the B800 site in molischianum-LH2.

Materials and
Methods
Apparatus
Electronic absorption and CD spectra were
measured with a spectrophotometer (UV-2450, Shimadzu) and a spectropolarimeter
(J-820, JASCO), respectively. Fluorescence emission spectra were measured
with a fluorescence measurement system (C9920-03G, Hamamatsu Photonics),
and apparent fluorescence quantum yields of B850 BChl a were estimated from the emission between 820 and 950 nm using software
installed in this system. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
was performed with a pump (LC-20AT, Shimadzu) and a detector (SPD-M20A
or SPD-20A, Shimadzu). Resonance Raman spectra were recorded on a
Raman microscope (NRS-7100, JASCO).

Materials
LH2
protein was isolated from the cultured
cells of the purple photosynthetic bacterium Phs. molischianum DSM120 according to previous reports.25,37 B800-depleted
LH2 was prepared from native LH2.25 BChl a was isolated from the cultured cells of Rba. sphaeroides.38,39 AcChl a was prepared from BChl a by oxidation
with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone.19,40 BChl a and AcChl a were purified
on a reverse-phase column 5C18-AR-II (10 mm i.d. ×
250 mm) with methanol as an eluent before reconstitution into LH2
proteins. A detergent n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) was purchased from Dojindo Laboratories, Co.

Pigment
Reconstitution
A solution of B800-depleted
LH2 in a mixed buffer of 20 mM Tris and 10 mM succinate containing
0.1% DDM (pH 8.0) was mixed with 1/100 volume of a methanol solution
of AcChl a or BChl a, followed by
incubation at 35 °C for 2 h in the dark. The sample was concentrated
by ultrafiltration using Amicon centricon concentrators (30 kDa cutoff,
Merk Millipore Ltd.) and was loaded onto a Sephacryl-S200 column (GE
Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris buffer containing 0.1% DDM and 150 mM NaCl
(pH 8.0). LH2 proteins collected were desalted by ultrafiltration
using Amicon centricon concentrators (30 kDa cutoff, Merk Millipore
Ltd.). LH2 proteins, which are reconstituted with AcChl a and BChl a, are hereafter denoted as AcChl-reconstituted
LH2 and BChl-reconstituted LH2, respectively.

The occupancy
of AcChl a in the B800 sites in AcChl-reconstituted
LH2 was estimated from electronic absorption spectra of extracted
chlorophyllous pigments in the Qy region
in methanol, as reported elsewhere.19 The
occupancy of BChl a in the B800 sites in BChl-reconstituted
LH2 was estimated by comparing Qy absorbance
of B800 BChl a in BChl-reconstituted LH2 with that
in native LH2.19

Resonance Raman Spectroscopy
An aliquot of an LH2 solution
in 20 mM Tris buffer containing 0.05% DDM (pH 8.0) was deposited on
a stainless plate and dried under a stream of N2 gas. Excitation
beam (355 nm) from an Nd:YAG laser was focused onto the sample film
through a 40× objective lens. The laser intensity at the sample
surface was adjusted to ∼0.4 mW, and the backscattering from
the samples was collected at 25 °C. Each spectrum was accumulated
for 30 s at a single spot to alleviate degradation of the LH2 samples.
To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, 27–55 spectra at different
points were averaged.

Transient Absorption Spectroscopy
Femtosecond time-resolved
transient absorption (TA) experiments were performed with a pair of
noncollinear optical parametric amplifiers (NOPA) (TOPAS-white, Light
Conversion), pumped by a regeneratively amplified Ti:sapphire laser
(Solstice, Spectra-Physics), as light sources. Output of one of the
NOPAs was set at either 800 or 695 nm to specifically excite the Qy band of BChl a or AcChl a in the B800 site for native LH2 or AcChl-reconstituted
LH2, respectively, as can be seen in the spectra shown in Figure S1. A prism pair was utilized to precompress
the laser pulses, and the pulse duration at the sample position was
about 130 ± 3.3 fs (FWHM) for the excitation at 800 nm and about
18.5 ± 0.38 fs (FWHM) at 695 nm, which were measured by the second
harmonic generation frequency-resolved optical gating (SHG-FROG) method
(Figure S2) and by the self-diffraction
frequency-resolved optical gating (SD-FROG) method (Figure S3), respectively. The excitation intensity at the
sample position was 15 μW (15 nJ), and the diameter of the focused
laser beam was ca. 0.15 mm. By rotating the polarization of the pump
pulse by a Berek compensator (Model 5540, New Focus), the polarization
between the pump and probe pulses was set at the magic angle. White-light
supercontinuum (400–930 nm) was generated by focusing the output
of another NOPA centered at 1100 nm into a rotating CaF2 window (thickness: 2 mm), and it was divided into probe and reference
pulses. The probe pulse was focused into the rotating sample cell
excited by the pump pulse, and the transmitted light was guided into
a multichrometer (MSP1000-V, Unisoku). The reference pulse was directly
guided into another multichrometer (MSP1000-V, Unisoku), and the differential
absorbance (ΔAbs) of the sample was calculated. The heterodyne-detected
optical Kerr effect (HD-OKE) signal between the pump and the probe
pulses (Figure S4) was obtained by replacing
the sample solution in the rotating cell by neat carbon tetrachloride,
and the electronic response signal was utilized to compensate the
group velocity dispersion of the TA signal. LH2 proteins were solubilized
in 20 mM Tris buffer containing 0.02% DDM (pH 8.0). The optical length
of the sample was 2 mm, and the Qy band
absorbance of B850 BChl a of the LH2 samples were
set at ca. 0.8.

Results and Discussion
Electronic Absorption and
Fluorescence Emission Spectra
AcChl a or
BChl a was reconstituted
into the B800 cavity of molischianum-LH2 by incubation
of B800-depleted molischianum-LH2 with 20 equivalents
of each pigment, followed by purification with size-exclusion chromatography.
BChl-reconstituted LH2 exhibited two intense Qy bands of B800 and B850 BChl a at 799 and
846 nm (Figure 2C).
These peak positions were identical to those in native LH2 (Figure 2A). AcChl-reconstituted
LH2 had no Qy band of B800 BChl a but showed a new absorption band at 690 nm (Figure 2D). This band was ascribed
to the Qy band of AcChl a in the B800 site. The Qy peak of AcChl a in the B800 site in molischianum-LH2
was shifted to a longer wavelength, by 13 nm (278 cm–1), than that of its monomer in acetone (Figure S5). This red shift of AcChl a is smaller
than that of BChl a in the B800 site from its monomeric
form in acetone (29 nm, 471 cm–1). Such a smaller Qy red shift is also observed in the reconstitution
of AcChl a into acidophilus-LH2.19 These results are rationalized by invoking the
changes in the dihedral angles of the 3-acetyl group with the macrocycle
plane or the differences in the extent of deformation of the tetrapyrrole
macrocycles between AcChl a and BChl a.19,41

Figure 2 Electronic absorption spectra of native LH2
(A), B800-depleted
LH2 (B), BChl-reconstituted LH2 (C), and AcChl-reconstituted LH2 (D)
in 20 mM Tris buffer containing 0.05% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (pH = 8.0). Spectra are normalized at the Qy peaks of B850 BChl a.

The Qy absorbance of AcChl a in AcChl-reconstituted
LH2 was smaller than that of B800 BChl a in native
LH2 and BChl-reconstituted LH2. This result is partially derived from
the smaller transition dipole strength of chlorin-type AcChl a than BChl a.19,42,43 Another reason is the occupancy of AcChl a in the eight B800 pockets in molischianum-LH2. Extraction of the chlorophyllous pigments from AcChl-reconstituted
LH2 indicated that the occupancy was 59 ± 12% in the eight B800
pockets (the average and standard deviation of three samples). In
contrast, the occupancy of BChl a in the B800 pockets
of BChl-reconstituted LH2 was estimated to be 107 ± 1% (the average
and standard deviation of three samples). Therefore, dehydrogenation
of the B-ring from BChl a (change from bacteriochlorin
to chlorin) impedes binding to the B800 cavity in molischianum-LH2. These results are in sharp contrast to the lack of a change
in the affinity to the B800 cavity in acidophilus-LH2 between AcChl a and BChl a.19 The difference can be explained by
the pigment orientations in the B800 site; the B-ring in (B)Chl pigments
is embedded in the protein matrix and located on the protein surface
in molischianum-LH2 and acidophilus-LH2, respectively.5−7,25 Therefore, the effect
of the dehydrogenation in the B-ring of BChl a on
the binding to the B800 cavity is more significant in molischianum-LH2 than in acidophilus-LH2. In contrast, the pigment
binding to the B800 site in sphaeroides-LH2 is affected
by the dehydrogenation of the B-ring of BChl a like
the case of molischianum-LH2.21 Note that incubation of larger amounts of AcChl a with B800-depleted LH2 gradually increased the occupancy
in the B800 sites, but the separation of unbound AcChl a with LH2 by the current size-exclusion chromatography became difficult.

The Qx band of BChl a in AcChl-reconstituted LH2 was positioned at 587 nm (Figure 2D). This Qx position was slightly blue-shifted from the Qx band in native LH2 and BChl-reconstituted LH2 at
590 nm (Figure 2A,C).
This blue shift is due to the disappearance of the Qx band of B800 BChl a (Figure 2B) since the Qx band of BChl a in molischianum-LH2 is contributed from both B800 and B850 BChl a, and their Qx positions slightly differed.25,44

The absorption bands of lycopene in AcChl-reconstituted LH2
were
positioned at 529 and 493 nm (Figure 2D). These positions were identical to those in native
LH2, B800-depleted LH2, and BChl-reconstituted LH2 (Figure 2A–C). These results
indicate that the insertion of AcChl a into the B800
site barely affects the electronic properties of lycopene. Note that
another band of lycopene at 466 nm, which was detected in the spectra
of the other three LH2 proteins, overlapped with the Soret band of
AcChl a in the spectrum of AcChl-reconstituted LH2.

AcChl a in the B800 site can transfer excitation
energy to B850 BChl a in AcChl-reconstituted LH2,
judged by steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy. Selective excitation
of AcChl a in the B800 site at 692 nm produced an
emission of B850 BChl a around 875 nm (Figure S6B). This corresponds to a B850 emission
by the excitation of B800 BChl a at 798 nm in BChl-reconstituted
LH2, which is generated by intracomplex EET (Figure S6A). The apparent fluorescence quantum yields of B850 BChl a by the excitation of AcChl a and BChl a in AcChl-reconstituted LH2 and BChl-reconstituted LH2,
which are indexes of EET efficiency,20,23,24 were estimated to be 9.5 ± 0.3 and 11 ±
0.5% (the averages and standard deviations of three samples), respectively.
The apparent quantum yield of B850 BChl a in AcChl-reconstituted
LH2 was slightly smaller than that in BChl-reconstituted LH2.

CD Spectra
Native LH2 exhibited reversed S-shaped and negative
CD signals, which were derived from B800 and
B850 BChl a, respectively, around 800 and 860 nm
(Figure 3A). This spectral
feature is characteristic of molischianum-LH2.45,46 In the CD spectra of B800-depleted LH2 and AcChl-reconstituted LH2,
the signal of B800 BChl a around 800 nm disappeared
(Figure 3B,D). The
CD signal of B800 BChl a was completely recovered
by the reconstitution of BChl a into the B800 site
(Figure 3C). AcChl a in the B800 site showed no CD signal around 700 nm (Figure 3D). The negative
CD signal of B850 BChl a in the CD spectrum of AcChl-reconstituted
LH2 around 860 nm was analogous to that of the other three LH2 proteins.
These results indicate that the insertion of AcChl a into the B800 site barely perturbs the orientation and electronic
structures of B850 BChl a.

Figure 3 CD spectra of native
LH2 (A), B800-depleted LH2 (B), BChl-reconstituted
LH2 (C), and AcChl-reconstituted LH2 (D) in the Qy region in 20 mM Tris buffer containing 0.05% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (pH = 8.0). The Qy absorbance values of B850 BChl a in the LH2 samples used for the measurements were 0.5.

Resonance Raman Spectra
The interactions of AcChl a in the B800 site with the polypeptides in molishianum-LH2 were scrutinized by resonance Raman spectroscopy (Figure 4). All of the LH2 proteins
examined here had intense Raman signals at 1603 cm–1, which were assigned to the stretching modes of the methine bridges
of (B)Chl pigments. Native LH2 exhibited the 3-C=O and the
13-C=O stretching vibrational bands of BChl a at 1635 and 1659 cm–1, respectively (Figure 4A). A difference
Raman spectrum between B800-depleted LH2 (Figure 4D) and native LH2 showed the 3-C=O
stretching vibrational band of B800 BChl a at 1628
cm–1 as a negative signal (Figure 4G). This result indicates that the 3-acetyl
group in B800 BChl a is hydrogen-bonded with polypeptides
in molischianum-LH2, as revealed in its crystal structure.5 The 13-C=O band of B800 BChl a was observed at 1652 cm–1 as a negative signal
in the difference spectrum (Figure 4G). This is in line with a previous report on Raman
spectroscopy of molischianum-LH2.47 BChl-reconstituted LH2 (Figure 4B) showed the 3-C=O and the 13-C=O
stretching vibrational bands of BChl a at almost
the same positions (1636 and 1663 cm–1) as those
of native LH2, indicating that BChl a is properly
accommodated in the B800 site. This is supported by few Raman signals
in a difference spectrum between BChl-reconstituted LH2 and native
LH2 (Figure 4E).

Figure 4 Resonance Raman
spectra of native LH2 (A), BChl-reconstituted LH2
(B), AcChl-reconstituted LH2 (C), and B800-depleted LH2 (D). Spectra
are normalized at the 1603 cm–1 signals, and the
spectrum (D) is shown by multiplication by 2/3 to account for the
lack of chlorophyllous pigments in the B800 sites. The difference
spectra (E–G) are obtained by subtracting the spectrum (A)
from spectra (B–D), respectively.

A difference Raman spectrum between AcChl-reconstituted LH2 and
native LH2 showed a positive signal at 1640 cm–1 with a negative signal at 1625 cm–1 (Figure 4F). This pattern
was assigned to a higher-frequency shift of the 3-C=O stretching
vibrational band of the 3-acetyl group in AcChl a than that in B800 BChl a. This shift suggests that
the 3-acetyl group in AcChl a is hydrogen-bonded
with β′-Thr23, but the hydrogen bond is weaker than that
between B800 BChl a and β′-Thr23 in
native LH2. Since the 3-acetyl group in B800 BChl a is strongly hydrogen-bonded with β′-Thr23 in native
LH2 (hydrogen-bond length, 2.3 Å),25 this hydrogen bond is sensitive to a slight change in the orientation
of the 3-acetyl group. Therefore, the decrease in the strength of
the hydrogen bond between the 3-acetyl group in AcChl a and β′-Thr23 suggests that the dehydrogenation of the
C7–C8 bond produces a small distortion in the orientation of
the 3-acetyl group in the B800 cavity. The difference in the 3-C=O
stretching vibrational bands between AcChl a and
BChl a is qualitatively in line with the smaller
red shift of the Qy band in AcChl a by
insertion into the B800 cavity compared to BChl a (Figure 2) since
the downshift of the 3-C=O stretching mode of BChl a from the monomeric form is correlated with its Qy peak positions in light-harvesting proteins of purple bacteria.48

The 13-C=O stretching vibrational
band of the chlorophyllous
pigments in AcChl-reconstituted LH2 was detected at 1660 cm–1 (Figure 4C), whose
position was almost identical to that in native LH2 (Figure 4A). A positive signal in the
difference spectrum between AcChl-reconstituted LH2 and native LH2
at 1557 cm–1 was assigned to the C7=C8 stretching
vibrational band of AcChl a (Figure 4F).

Energy Transfer Dynamics
To investigate
intracomplex
EET, femtosecond TA spectroscopy of native LH2 and AcChl-reconstituted
LH2 was conducted. In the TA spectra of native LH2 (Figure 5A) excited at 800 nm, a negative
band with a minimum at 800 nm appeared immediately after the excitation.
A similar immediate appearance of a negative band at 695 nm was also
observed in the TA spectra of AcChl-reconstituted LH2 (Figure 5B) excited at 695 nm. These
bands can be assigned to the superposition of the ground-state bleach
(GSB) and the stimulated emission (SE) of the energy donors. By increasing
the delay time between the pump and probe pulses, these bands decayed
and new positive and negative bands at 830 and 855 nm appeared simultaneously,
which indicates EET from the donors to the acceptor B850. The time
evolution of the spectra was much slower for AcChl-reconstituted LH2,
indicating slower EET compared to native LH2.

Figure 5 TA spectra of native
LH2 (A) and AcChl-reconstituted LH2 (B) excited
at 800 and 695 nm, respectively, with pulse durations of 130 and 18.5
fs (FWHM). The time delay increases from bottom to top.

Global analysis was applied to the time dependence of the
differential
absorbance (ΔAbs) at various wavelengths (Figure 6), and decay-associated spectra (DAS) were
obtained (Figures 7 and 8). Two DAS components were applied to
represent the donor and the acceptor of the EET, and any intramolecular
energy relaxation process (spectral shift) was ignored. As seen in Figure 6, the experimental
and fitting results are in good agreement, confirming the validity
of this model. The DAS components A (red curves in Figures 7 and 8) with shorter lifetimes represent the decay and the rise of the
EET donor (B800 BChl a and reconstituted AcChl a) and acceptor (B850 BChl a), and the
DAS components B (blue curves in Figures 7 and 8) with longer
lifetimes represent the decay of the excited state of B850 BChl a. The lifetime for the shorter DAS components was 990 ±
2.8 fs for native LH2 (Figure 7), but it extended to 5.0 ± 0.08 ps for AcChl-reconstituted
LH2 (Figure 8). The
DAS component A in Figure 7 exhibits a negative band at 800 nm, suggesting the decrease
of the mixed GSB/SE band of B800 BChl a, while a
weak negative band at 695 nm in the DAS component A in Figure 8 corresponds to the decrease
of the mixed GSB/SE band of reconstituted AcChl a. Negative and positive bands at 830 and 855 nm in components A in
both Figures 7 and 8 represent the increase of the positive excited-state
absorption band and the negative GSB/SE band of B850 BChl a, respectively. The lifetime for component A in Figure 7 is consistent with
the EET time constant previously reported for native molischianum-LH2 at room temperature.45,49 The slower decay of
component A in Figure 8 suggests that intracomplex EET in AcChl-reconstituted LH2 is about
5-fold slower than that in native LH2.

LH2 (B).

Figure 7 Decay-associated spectra (DAS) obtained from
the global analysis
of the TA spectra of native LH2. Components with time constants of
990 ± 2.8 fs (A) and 1.3 ± 0.003 ns (B) were obtained.

Figure 8 Decay-associated spectra (DAS) obtained from the global
analysis
of the TA spectra of AcChl-reconstituted LH2. Components with time
constants of 5.0 ± 0.08 ps (A) and 1.4 ± 0.011 ns (B) were
obtained.

It was previously reported that
AcChl a in the
B800 site of acidophilus-LH2 and sphaeroides-LH2 exhibits EET to B850 BChl a with a time constant
of about 5 ps,15,21 which is comparable to the currently
reported result. The major reason for the slower EET for AcChl-reconstituted
LH2 is the decrease of the spectral overlap between the EET donor
and the acceptor. This study thus demonstrates that the spectral overlap
between the cyclic tetrapyrroles in the B800 site and B850 BChl a is generally responsible for EET dynamics in LH2 proteins.

AcChl-reconstituted LH2 exhibited homogeneous EET dynamics from
the energy-donating semiartificial pigment (AcChl a) to the energy accepter (B850 BChl a) due to the
accommodation of AcChl a in the well-defined environment.
The current homogeneous EET dynamics is in sharp contrast to the multicomponent
EET in LH2 covalently attached with artificial chromophores.32 Therefore, the reconstitution of artificial
chromophores into the B800 site in LH2 is advantageous for development
of biohybrid light-harvesting proteins.

Conclusions
AcChl a was successfully reconstituted into the
B800 site in molischianum-LH2. The red shift of the Qy band of AcChl a induced by
insertion into the B800 cavity was smaller than that of BChl a in molischianum-LH2, suggesting that
the dihedral angle of the 3-acetyl group with the macrocycle plane
or the deformation of the macrocycle of AcChl a in
the B800 cavity differed from those of BChl a in molischianum-LH2. Resonance Raman spectroscopy demonstrated
that the 3-acetyl group in AcChl a in the B800 site
is hydrogen-bonded with β′-Thr23 in molischianum-LH2. This hydrogen-bonding pattern is consistent with B800 BChl a in native LH2, although the hydrogen bond between the
3-acetyl group and β′-Thr23 is weakened by the dehydrogenation
of the B-ring from BChl a (7,8,17,18-tetrahydroporphyrin
→ 17,18-dihyroporphyrin). CD spectroscopy indicates that AcChl a is accommodated in molischianum-LH2 without
perturbation of the local protein structure.

AcChl a in the B800 site functioned as an energy
donor to B850 BChl a in moliscianum-LH2. The energy transfer rate from AcChl a in the
B800 site to B850 BChl a was about 5-fold slower
than that from B800 BChl a. The slow kinetics is
likely due to the decreased spectral overlap between an emission band
of AcChl a and B850 BChl a. This
study demonstrates that the replacement of B800 BChl a with AcChl a enables molischianum-LH2 to collect red light, which is not captured by LH2 despite red
wavelengths being most abundant at the surface of Earth. Insertion
of modified pigments into the B800 site in molischianum-LH2 will thus be useful not only for elucidation of the mechanisms
of pigment binding and intracomplex EET in LH2 proteins but also for
engineering the photofunctions of LH2 proteins toward the control
of photosynthetic activities in purple bacteria.
