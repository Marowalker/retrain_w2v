Recent
years have witnessed an extraordinary spurt in attention
toward the wave-manipulating strategies revealed by phase–amplitude
metasurfaces. Recently, it has been shown that, when two different
phase-encoded metasurfaces responsible for doing separate missions
are added together based on the superposition theorem, the mixed digital
phase distribution will realize both missions at the same time. In
this paper, via a semi-analytical procedure, we demonstrate that such
a theorem is not necessarily valid when using phase-only metasurfaces
or ignoring the element pattern functions. We introduce the concept
of asymmetric spatial power divider (ASPD) with arbitrary power ratio
levels in which modulating both amplitude and phase of the meta-atoms
is inevitable to fully control the power intensity pattern of a reflective
metasurface. Numerical simulations illustrate that the proposed ASPD
designed by proper phase and amplitude distribution over the surface
can directly generate a desired number of beams with predetermined
orientations and power budgets. The C-shaped Pancharatnam–Berry
meta-atoms locally realize the optimal phase and amplitude distribution
in each case, and the good conformity between simulations and theoretical
predictions verifies the presented formalism. A prototype of our ASPD
designs is also fabricated and measured, and the experimental results
corroborate well our numerical and semi-analytical predictions. Our
findings not only offer possibilities to realize arbitrary spatial
power dividers over subwavelength scale but also reveal an economical
and simple alternative for a beamforming array antenna.

1 Introduction
One of the favorites of humankind is guiding the electromagnetic
(EM) waves in their desired direction. According to the inability
of natural materials to provide exotic wave–matter interactions,
metamaterials have paved the way to control the EM waves in an unprecedented
manner.1,2 Metamaterials are artificial subwavelength
metal/dielectric composites that arm a platform to expose various
rich applications including, but not limited to, invisibility cloaks,3−5 negative refraction,6,7 illusion,8,9 beam
deflection,10,11 or epsilon-near-zero behaviors.12,13 To overcome the metamaterials’ disadvantages arising from
fabrication complexities, high inherent losses, strong dispersion,
and bulky profiles, metasurfaces have emerged as their 2D version
to offer a promising groundwork for tailoring diverse wave signatures
such as amplitude,14,15 phase,16,17 polarization,18−20 wave vector,21 and transverse
field profiles.22,23 The initial overwhelming interest
in metasurfaces lies in abrupt and controllable change of wavefronts
through a spatial inhomogeneity made by subwavelength scatterers,
called meta-atoms, over an infinitesimally thin interface whereby
we are able to mold wavefronts into shapes that can be designed at
will.

Along the direction of evolution in metasurfaces, it is
time to
fully manipulate the power intensity pattern of the metasurfaces,
an appealing functionality that has not been reported yet. We will
illustrate that the conventional beam splitters24−26 generate two/multiple
beams with compulsive power ratios dictated by their tilt angles.
Access to asymmetric spatial power dividers (ASPD) with full/independent
control over the power level carried by each beam/channel, however,
can give us a fabulous flexibility and privilege and is highy demanded
in different practical applications, such as satellite communications,
multiple-target radar systems, and multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) communication.27,28 Formerly, a few studies have
contributed to addressing multibeam reflectarrays producing multiple
beams with variable power ratio levels. For instance, Nayeri et al.25 proposed a single-feed reflectarray with asymmetric
beam directions and power levels. However, this work has been accompanied
with a brute-force and illposed optimization procedure, resulting
in a high computational cost that must be repeated afresh if the design
specifications change. More recently, Zhang et al.24 demonstrated that, by changing the angle of incidence,
the amount of power carried by each scattered beam can be controlled.
Nevertheless, once the power ratios are determined, the direction
of the reflected beams is forced to the user. Meanwhile, the presented
design, which is restricted to only two beams, is based on numerical
predictions, and no semi-analytical framework supports their study.
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the precise control
of power levels of multiple beams with arbitrary orientations has
not been reported yet and quite remains as a challenging task.

In an effort to manipulate the EM waves with more degrees of freedom,
a simple but yet powerful concept had emerged as “Coding metasurface”.29,30 By purposefully distributing the coding particles ordered by a certain
coding pattern over a 2D plane, the coding metasurfaces open the door
to many novel and programmable functional devices such as abnormal
mirrors,31−36 low scattering surfaces,17,37−39 and information encryption interfaces.40 Recently, it was shown that, when two different coding patterns
are added together via the superposition theorem, the mixed coding
pattern will elaborately perform both functionalities of primary metasurfaces
at the same time.41 More recently, it has
been also demonstrated that involving the complex codes aids in reaching
multifunctional meta-reflectors, where several missions of coding
metasurfaces could be flexibly superposed together by means of the
addition theorem.42 Nevertheless, in these
versions, the addition operation of two digital codes just captured
the phase information of the coding particles, and the amplitude data
of the final coding pattern were deliberately ignored. Based on the
Huygens principle, we will describe that such an assumption would
bring irreparable consequences when dealing with the power intensity
pattern of the metasurfaces.

In this paper, the key step in
obtaining the proposed ASPD is to
design a set of subwavelength meta-atoms with arbitrary reflective
phase and amplitude responses to fully control the power intensity
pattern of the metasurface. Based on the Huygens principle, a general
and straightforward semi-analytical method is presented to predict
the exact power level of each radiated beam without any optimization
procedure. It is demonstrated that the ASPD design with phase-only
meta-atoms fails to achieve satisfactory results. Moreover, the quantization/discretization
and the element factor effects are incorporated in our design. The
numerical simulations depict that, benefited from reflective C-shaped
particles with arbitrary local phase and amplitude response, we can
accurately manipulate the number and power ratio levels of the emitting
multiple beams without sacrificing the meta-atom amplitude and distorting
the tilt angles. As a proof of concept, several illustrative examples
numerically demonstrated which one of them is experimentally validated.
Eventually, the simulated and measured results have a very good agreement
with our theoretical predictions. The authors believe that the proposed
ASPD exposes a new opportunity to implement spatial power dividers
for various applications such as multiple-target radar systems, beamforming
networks, and MIMO communication.

2 Results
and Discussion
Unlike the traditional metamaterials specified
with continuous
effective permittivity and permeability parameters, the metasurfaces
drastically facilitate the wave–matter interaction where the
macroscopic designs rely on introducing field discontinuity along
the surface by spatially engineering the scattering meta-atoms in
an array.43 By introducing abrupt phase
shifts covering the range of [0 – 2π], metasurfaces with
spatially varying geometries,44 DC biases,40,45 orientations,46,47 light controlling,48 and time modulation49 can imprint specified phase discontinuities on the propagating fields
over the subwavelength scale based on the generalized Snell’s
law.50 Referring to this law, the in-plane
component of the incident wave vector is artificially mapped to that
of the desired reflected one as kr∥ = (k0 sin θi cos
φi + ∇ φx)x̂ + (k0 sin θi sin φi + ∇ φy)ŷ wherein the gradient symbols denote
the slopes of phase variations along the x and y directions. For kr∥ > ki, the anomalous reflection behavior appears
in which the direction of the scattered beam can be determined by51 1  

2.1 Theoretical Framework
Figure 1a demonstrates the conceptual
illustration of the ASPD design generating multiple beams of different
power levels that consists of N × N equal-sized meta-atoms with the periodicity of D along both vertical and horizontal directions. From the antenna
array theory and upon illuminating by a normal plane wave, the far-field
pattern function of the whole metasurface can be rigorously calculated
as the superposition of the fields scattered by each contributing
meta-atom52 2   3  

Figure 1 (a) Conceptual
illustration of the proposed ASPD architecture and
(b) front view of the employed meta-atom. The geometrical parameters
are D =10 mm, r1 = 4
mm, r2 = 3 mm, and w =
3.2 mm.

In the above equations, Eelement(θ,
φ) and amn are, respectively, the
pattern function and complex reflection coefficient of the meta-atoms, F(θ, φ) refers to the array factor, θ
and φ are the elevation and azimuth observation angles, respectively,
and k = 2π/λ indicates the wavenumber,
where λ is the working wavelength. The directivity function
can be subsequently computed by31,53 4  

Regarding
the Fourier connection between the complex phase–amplitude
distribution over the surface and its radiated beams,54 many EM theorems can be applied to design the ASPD metasurface.
For instance, based on the superposition of the aperture fields and
the Huygens principle,25,55 the additive combination of M different phase–amplitude distributions, amnj, belonging to distinct single-mission
metasurfaces yields a mixed phase–amplitude pattern, bmn, whereby all M individual/primary
missions will appear at the same time. The mixed phase–amplitude
pattern determines the map of the local phase and amplitude of the
reflection coefficient of the meta-atoms in the superimposed metasurface.
To generate M multiple functionalities governed by M different phase–amplitude patterns, simultaneously,
the local EM response of the constituent meta-atoms in the combined
metasurface must read the following addition principle42 5   6  

Here, |amnj| and φmnjare
the reflection amplitude and the reflection phase
information belonging to the (m, n)th particle in the jth phase–amplitude pattern,
respectively, and bmn carries the phase–amplitude
information of the (m, n)th particle
in the superimposed pattern. Without loss of generality, one can logically
assume that the individual functionalities made by the primary phase–amplitude
distributions (such as focusing, abnormal deflection, and so on) do
not necessarily require the amplitude variation of meta-atoms, that
is, |amnj| = 1.56 However, it will be shown that ignoring the amplitude information
of bmn coefficients may encounter serious
problems when we deal with the power intensity pattern of the superimposed
metasurface. Hence, the combined phase–amplitude pattern must
possess both phase and amplitude information of the final array. By
taking 2D IFFT from eq 6 and assuming that |amnj| =
1 7  

Knowing that Fj(θ, φ) =
IFFT(ejφmnj),40 then 8  in which Fsup(θ, φ) stands for the superimposed array
factor. Thus, the scattered fields of the superimposed metasurface
can be written according to eq 2 9  

It should be noted that the multiple scattered beams created
by
the combined phase–amplitude pattern obey the above equation.
Henceforth, in line with our outlined intentions, we develop a generalized
format for the addition principle whereby the power level of each
radiating beam can be independently controlled by incorporating different
multiplicative power constants, , to eqs 5 and 6. Here, j is just the same superscript representing the index of
each contributing
phase–amplitude pattern. A mathematical manipulation similar
to that performed for eqs 7–9yields 10   11  

The above
formalism represents a more general form of the superposition
theorem in which Esupgen(θ, φ) caused by the superimposed
phase–amplitude distribution, bmngen, contains M independent multiple beams pointing
at (θj, φj) directions (see Figure 2). It should be remembered that the jth contributing phase–amplitude pattern is designed in a manner
that generates a pencil beam along the (θj, φj) direction. Subsequently,
for each couple of pencil beams, the power ratio level reads 12  where Psupgen(θj, φj) and Psupgen(θi, φi) illustrate
the peak power intensity of two arbitrarily selected
beams oriented along (θj, φj) and (θi, φi) orientations, respectively.
It should be noted that, in deducing eq 12, we assume that the angular position of
the maximum in the scattering pattern of each individual metasurface
is located in the vicinity of the null of the other scattering patterns,
that is, Escattj ≠ i(θi, φi) ≃ 0. Obviously, eq 12 does not remain further valid if we ignore
either the amplitude information of the mixed phase–amplitude
pattern, |bmn|, or the far-field pattern
function of the meta-atoms, Eelement(θ,
φ). Nevertheless, these important factors were neglected in
most of the previous studies.42

Figure 2 Schematic illustration
of the general form of the superposition
theorem by incorporating the power coefficients to generate multiple
asymmetric beams with arbitrary power ratio levels.

2.2 Concept Verification
In particular,
we assume the element pattern function as 13  Nevertheless,
the mere cosine
function of eq 13 closely
resembles the element factor of the metasurface particles.24,37,40 By substituting eq 13 into eq 12, one can readily infer that, to design an
ASPD with a desired set of power ratio levels for the emitting beams,
the power coefficients should be chosen as 14  

Once the power coefficients
are determined, the phase and amplitude information of the superimposed
phase–amplitude pattern can be immediately obtained from eq 10. After that, the phase/amplitude-adjustable
meta-atoms are aimed at realizing the required local EM reflections
dictated by the superimposed phase–amplitude pattern. For the
sake of simplicity, we put the focus of our design into the case of
metasurfaces with two and three asymmetric multiple beams to inspect
the performance of the proposed ASPD.

The numerical simulations
are first carried out in the MATLAB software
using the well-known antenna array theory. We begin the study with
semi-continuous designs in which the ASPD structures are discretized
in an imperceptible manner and no phase/amplitude quantization has
been adopted. The configuration of the semi-continuous demonstrations
is the same as depicted in Figure 2 in which all metasurfaces are composed of N = 200 particles separated periodically at the distance
of Dx = Dy = λ/20 together (to approximately mimic a laterally-infinite
surface with continuous phase/amplitude modulation). In the following,
we will present three different illustrative examples in which the
ASPD structure symmetrically/asymmetrically divides the power between
two multiple beams oriented along (θ1 = 10 °
, φ1 = 180 ° ) and (θ2 = 30
° , φ2 = 270 ° ) directions. In the first
illustration, we demonstrate how to achieve two asymmetrically oriented
scattering beams with a specific power ratio level by applying the
general form of the superposition theorem on two contributing phase–amplitude
distributions. The first metasurface driven by the gradient phase-only
map of amn1 individually reflects the incident waves into
the direction of (θ1 = 10 ° , φ1 = 180 ° ), while the second one is designed with the gradient
phase-only map of amn2 to scatter a single pencil beam pointing at
the direction of (θ2 = 30 ° , φ2 = 270 ° ). All individual single-beam metasurfaces in the following
examples have been designed based on the gradient phase-only patterns
achieved with the same method given in refs16 and.17 Finally, the superimposed metasurface
whose bmn phase–amplitude pattern
is obtained from eq 10 with  plays the role of an ASPD architecture
that elaborately splits the normal incidence into two asymmetric reflected
beams with the power ratio of Psupgen(θ2, φ2)/Psupgen(θ1, φ1) = 0.77 (see the simulated 2D scattering patterns in Figure 3a,b). Outstandingly, the semi-analytical
predictions based on the Huygens principle and the general form of
the superposition theorem estimates well the power ratio level as
0.773. This is the best place to explain that ignoring the element
pattern function of eq 13, like what is done in previous studies,31,52,53,57,58 imports noticeable error in predicting the power
ratio levels of differently oriented pencil beams. For instance, without
considering the element pattern function, the superimposed metasurface
of our example should generate two pencil beams carrying equal power
intensity, which essentially contradict with the results of Figure 3a,b. To investigate
the flexibility of the design, we intend to demonstrate another ASPD
dividing the scattered power equally (Psupgen(θ2, φ2)/Psupgen(θ1, φ1) = 1) into the same two asymmetric pencil beams, a special
functionality that the conventional wave-splitting platforms fail
to achieve.24 Referring to the Huygens
principle and the general form of the superposition theorem in eq 10, the ASPD structure
must be endowed by the superimposed phase–amplitude pattern, bmn, obtained by assuming  to expose
two differently oriented beams
with identical power budgets. As can be seen in Figure 3c,d, the power ratio level of two scattered
beams satisfactorily approaches to unity (about 0.99) with the same
desired tilt angles. We continue to study another peculiar performance
that cannot be easily realized via the traditional phase-only metasurfaces,
that is, producing the same two independent asymmetric beams on different
planes with the power ratio level of (Psupgen(θ2, φ2)/Psupgen(θ1, φ1) = 1.85). In this case, we apply the general form of the
superposition theorem on two phase-only patterns by setting . As the inset of Figure 3e,f demonstrates, 65% of the
reflected power
approximately propagates toward the higher elevation angle, and the
remaining power is arrested in the lower elevation angle, as theoretically
expected. We remark that the very little discrepancy between our theoretical
predictions and MATLAB simulations can be attributed to the unwanted
side lobes (information losses) originating from our initial assumptions:
continuous and laterally-infinite phase/amplitude modulating that
are not ideally satisfied during the simulations. Anyway, the correctness
and robustness of the proposed design strategy are confirmed theoretically
and numerically. The presented concept can be further surveyed by
illustrating two different examples in which the superimposed phase–amplitude
metasurfaces act as an ASPD with three individual scattered beams.
In these scenarios, three equations are postulated to disclose the
power ratio level between each couple of beams 15   16   17

In these examples, we
wish the ASPD structure to generate three
independent/asymmetric pencil beams with (θ1 = 10
° , φ1 = 90 ° ), (θ2 =
20 ° , φ2 = 270 ° ), and (θ3 = 35 ° , φ3 = 180 ° ). Figure 4a–c represents three
different power intensity patterns in each of which three reflected
beams have been successfully acquired by proper sets of predetermined
power ratio levels , and , , and , as well as , , , respectively. As can be observed from Figure 4a–c, the tilt
angles and power ratios excellently corroborate our theoretical predictions
(for further information, see Table 1).

With the above discussions,
we have made two observations in the
general form of the superposition principle when considering a laterally-infinite
continuously modulated metasurface: (i) deflecting the incident wave
into multiple arbitrarily oriented reflected beams and (ii) dividing
the power asymmetrically between the reflected beams regardless of
their tilt angles. Such illustrative examples divulge that the weighted
combination of individual phase-only patterns by incorporating the
amplitude information of the superimposed metasurface will drastically
boost the current wave-manipulating abilities in the framework of
the general superposition theorem and furnish a robust and flexible
design approach for such power-based complicated manipulations. Theoretically
speaking, any controllable power ratio levels for multibeam emissions
can be obtained by using the proposed ASPD structures without resorting
to any brute-force optimization schemes. Prior to providing the realization
detail, we stress that, in this paper, the meta-atoms occupying the
ASPD will be characterized with both amplitude and phase information.
To highlight the necessity of this revisiting, let us consider the
same design approach given in ref,42 which
deliberately neglects the amplitude information of the superimposed
metasurface. The results of Figures 3c and 4c have been reproduced
by aggressively sacrificing the amplitude data of the combined metasurface.
As can be noticed in Figure 5, the power ratio level of the scattered beams does not further
match with our theoretical predictions, thereby highlighting the significant
role of the amplitude information in designing a perfect ASPD structure.
Unlike the previous strategies that are applicable only for predicting
the direction of tilted beams, the regulations presented in this study
are more general and applicable to study the power intensity patterns
of the phase–amplitude metasurfaces. It sounds effective in
various antenna applications and simultaneous multitarget detection
scenarios where the power ratio levels of differently oriented scattered
beams are required to be manipulated independently.

form of the superposition theorem by comparing the 2D scattering patterns

2.3 Numerical Simulations: Incorporating Discretization
and Quantization Effects
Up to now, we have studied semi-continuous
phase/amplitude modulation over a laterally-infinite surface, an optimistic
hypothesis that cannot be realized in practice. Nevertheless, aggressive
discretization and quantization may bring up great advantages such
as lower quality factors caused by relatively large element separations,
less susceptibility to mutual coupling effects, immunity against fabrication
tolerance, low-cost manufacturing, and robust implementation.37 While most theoretical proposals on metasurfaces
deal with continuously varying phase–amplitude or impedance
distributions,40 we will demonstrate how
aggressive discretization/quantization deteriorates the ASPD performance.
Particularly, the ASPD structure is realized using spatially inhomogeneous
distribution of an agile meta-atom whose size and phase/amplitude
levels specify the grade of discretization and quantization, respectively.
Since the phase–amplitude patterns of the proposed ASPD structures
in eq 6 were assumed
to be ideally continuous in level and spatial position; henceforth,
the discretization and quantization effects should be involved in
our study as the constituent meta-atoms occupy a certain size and
expose a quantized reflection phase/amplitude.

To investigate
the discretization and quantization impacts, the antecedent ASPD demonstrations
are reaccomplished this time for structures consisting of N = 30 meta-atoms with the inter-element space of Dx = Dy = λ/3
(aggressive discretization), where the phase–amplitude profile
describing the superimposed metasurfaces is quantized into two or
three levels. With four-level quantization (2-bit) for both amplitude
and phase responses, the ASPDs are constructed by 16 elements manifesting
phase/amplitude states of “0°/0”, “90°/0.33”,
“180°/0.66”, and “270°/1”, while
for eight-level quantization (3-bit), the building units of ASPDs
are characterized with 64 distinct phase/amplitude responses of “0°/0”,
“45°/0.14”, “90°/0.28”, “135°/0.42”,
“180°/0.57”, “225°/0.71”, “270°/0.85”,
and “325°/1”. Regarding the above-mentioned criteria,
the phase–amplitude patterns obtained for the ASPDs presented
in the previous section have been discretized and quantized. The numerical
simulations have been reaccomplished using MATLAB. A fair comparison
between the power intensity patterns generated by the semi-continuous
and quantized/discretized phase–amplitude distributions has
been carried out in Figure 6a–d. In the first illustration, the ASPD structures
with two-level (Figure 6a) and three-level quantization (Figure 6b) serve to divide the incident power equally, Psupgen(θ2, φ2)/Psupgen(θ1, φ1) = 1, between two scattered beams oriented
along (θ1 = 15 ° , φ1 = 180°)
and (θ2 = 30 ° , φ2 = 270°)
directions. In the other example, the ASPD meta-devices with two-level
(Figure 6c) and three-level
quantization (Figure 6d) sets for Psupgen(θ2, φ2)/Psupgen(θ1, φ1) = 1.44 are responsible
for asymmetrically scattering two pencil beams with the tilt angles
of (θ1 = 30 ° , φ1 = 180°)
and (θ2 = 30 ° , φ2 = 270°).
As the inset of these figures displays, although the architectures
with two-level quantization fail to achieve satisfactory results in
comparison to those of continuously modulated designs, the ASPDs with
three-level quantization efficiently operate, even in the presence
of aggressive discretization. The quantitative summary of the above-mentioned
results is tabulated in Table 2. Consequently, one can conclude that the general form of
the superposition theorem based on the Huygens principle does not
remain valid under aggressive quantization. As a deduction, conventional
1-bit and 2-bit coding metasurfaces are not able to act as a perfect
ASPD. Meanwhile, to have a full control over the power pattern intensity
of the ASPD designs, it is required to modulate both phase and amplitude
states of the meta-atoms in >3 quantization levels.44,59−63

Different methodological attempts
have been made to simultaneously
modulate the amplitude and phase profiles of a metasurface by tuning
the geometry of antennas.44 We begin the
realization of the ASPD designs by discussing an agile phase–amplitude-controlling
meta-atom whose topology is depicted in Figure 2b. The meta-atoms employed in this paper
integrate the functionality of a metasurface for phase control and
a metasurface for amplitude control, which are adjusted with the geometrical
configuration and angular orientation of C-shaped particles, respectively.44,47 The phase-controlling metasurface is composed of geometrically engineered
C-shaped antennas and functions in a linear cross-polarization scheme.
Indeed, by changing the arm length and the open angle of the employed
meta-atoms, the phase can be robustly and independently controlled
in the reflection mode with a polarization orthogonal to that of the
incident wave (Figure 1b). The symmetry line of each particle is oriented along the +45°
or −45° angle to maximize the polarization conversion
ratio merit.44 The amplitude-controlling
metasurface, however, consists of C-shaped meta-atoms of the same
geometry in which the reflection amplitude can be independently modulated
by varying the orientations.44,46,47 Merging the design rules of these two types of metasurfaces yields
a C-shaped meta-atom whose cross-polarized phase and amplitude responses
can be separately manipulated by changing its geometry and orientation
(Figure 7a–d).
The front view of the established meta-atoms is pictured in Figure 1b in which they are
composed of a C-shaped metallic structure etched on a 3.2 mm-thick
FR4 substrate (ϵr = 4.3 and tanδ
= 0.025). To block the transmitted power, the ASPD structure is terminated
with a copper (σ = 5.8 × 107 S/m) ground plane.
The periodicity of the meta-atom is equal to λ/3, where λ
is the operating wavelength at 10 GHz, and the other geometrical parameters
are given in the caption of Figure 1. By engineering the geometrical parameters of open
angle (α) and orientation angle (β), one can independently
control the phase and amplitude of the cross-polarized reflection,
respectively, a necessary condition to realize the general form of
the superposition theorem. The proposed meta-atoms are characterized
with the Floquet solver of the commercial software CST Microwave Studio
where periodic boundary conditions are applied to x and y directions to simulate a laterally-infinite
periodic array, while the Floquet ports are assigned to the z direction. Figure 7a,b and Figure 7c,d demonstrate the simulated cross-polarized reflection phase and
amplitude coefficients with varying β and α parameters,
respectively. When β = ± 45°, the maximum energy from
the incident wave will be coupled to the cross-polarization component,
and for the case of β = 0° or 90°, the cross-polarization
component will vanish. Meanwhile, the cross-polarized reflection phase
spans the whole 180° phase range when α varies and β
is kept constant. By adding ±90° to β, the amplitude
remains constant, while the reflection phase experiences further changes
of ±180°.14 Due to the important
role of the element factor in our presentations, the pattern function
of the meta-atom employed in this paper is also simulated in CST Microwave
Studio, and the corresponding result is displayed in Figure 8. This figure illustrates that
the designed meta-atoms have maximum scattering field intensity along
the boresight direction, while it falls down gradually when the observation
direction deviates from θ = 0. This element factor, which can
be approximated by a cosine function, will be involved in eq 12 to accurately predict
the power ratio level of multiple beams scattered by the ASPD designs.

To further validate the concept
and dive in the performance of
our designs in a more realistic configuration, the finite-size ASPD
architectures are excited by a normal plane wave in a full-wave simulation
host, CST Microwave Studio. The design follows our previously developed
analytical formalism, and we characterize the functionality of the
ASPDs (with three-level quantization) through a bistatic scattering
pattern measurement setup numerically. In the following, we present
two different classes of power-dividing examples in which two scattered
beams have the same evaluational (Figure 9) and azimuthal (Figure 10) angles, respectively. The phase and amplitude
distributions of the contributing metasurfaces to the superposition
principle for achieving the final ASPD designs of Figure 9a–f are presented in
the Supporting Information. A three-beam-generating
metasurface (Figure 9c) is also perused by a full-wave simulation to show the powerful
ability of the proposed ASPD meta-devices in generating multibeam
scattered beams with asymmetric power ratio levels. Without loss of
generality, a y-polarized normal incidence is considered
here. As the first demonstration, based on the general form of the
superposition theorem and Huygens principle, we have combined two
gradient phase-only metasurfaces with considering  to produce pencil beams along
(θ1 = 15 ° , φ1 = 90 °
) and ( θ2 = 35 ° , φ2 = 180 ° ) directions,
respectively. Therefore, the superimposed phase–amplitude metasurface
should emit two main beams whose carried power levels are dictated
by both their tilt angles and power coefficients. In this way, as
expected from eq 12,
the power ratio of two scattered beams must obey Psupgen(θ2, φ2)/Psupgen(θ1, φ1) = 1.

The full-wave simulation results of the 3D and 2D scattering patterns
(φ = 0° and 90° planes) depicted in Figure 9a,b corroborate well our theoretical
prediction where they report the power ratio level and the beam angles
as 1.03 and θ1 = 15° and θ2 = 35°, respectively. The slight discrepancy (only 0.12 dB difference)
between the results can be attributed to the discretization effects,
finite size of the metasurface, and the inevitable coupling between
the meta-atoms. For the second demonstration, the basic gradient phase-only
metasurfaces creating two pencil beams pointing at (θ1 = 15 ° , φ1 = 90 ° ) and ( θ2 = 35 ° , φ2 = 180 ° ) directions
are added by choosing the power coefficients of . Furthermore,
the difference between the
power intensity levels are just commanded by their distinct tilt angles.
By applying the power coefficients into the general form of the superposition
theorem, the scattered beams are theoretically achieved to have the
power ratio level of Psupgen(θ2, φ2)/Psupgen(θ1, φ1) = 0.719. The
simulated results of the 2D and 3D bistatic scattering patterns (see Figure 9c,d) show that the
power ratio reaches 0.705 (only 0.08 dB difference), which has an
excellent conformity with our analytical predictions. Moreover, the
scattered beams are satisfactorily oriented along the predetermined
directions. The summary of the quantitative results is tabulated in
the first and second rows of Table 3. Our final example is devoted to a three-beam-generating
ASPD whose numerical and theoretical power specifications are listed
in Figure 9e,f and Table 4. The achievements
observed by the comparison between analytical and numerical results
depict a perfect concordance. The existing negligible errors are mostly
due to the discretization and finite size of the ASPD, which are interestingly
less than 3%. By skimming the scattering results of Figure 10a–d and the detailed
comparison given in the third and fourth rows of Table 3, one can immediately deduce
that the fixed-θ radiating ASPD structures also function well.
The phase and amplitude distributions of the contributing metasurfaces
to the superposition principle for achieving the final ASPD designs
of Figure 10a–d
are presented in the Supporting Information. Overall, the proposed ASPD structures successfully perform their
missions, that is, dividing the power asymmetrically and arbitrarily
between multiple beams pointing at our desired directions, a prominent
functionality that was not reported.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a general version of the superposition
theorem based
on the Huygens principle was proposed for the first time to introduce
the concept of ASPD architectures whereby the power can be asymmetrically
and arbitrarily divided between multiple beams oriented along the
predetermined directions. The proposed design scheme is not accompanied
with any brute-force optimization, trial-and-error steps, and time-consuming
procedures. Particularly, it was theoretically shown that, unlike
the previous demonstrations, both phase and amplitude profiles of
metasurfaces must be modulated to empower us to flexibly control their
power intensity patterns. Benefited from the C-shaped meta-atoms,
we were able to independently tailor the local reflection phase and
amplitude with three-level quantization. Several illustrative examples
were presented in this paper to validate the concept. A prototype
of our ASPD designs is also fabricated and measured, and the corresponding
experimental results are in good accordance with our numerical and
semi-analytical predictions. This work takes a great step forward
in designing spatial power dividers for which many promising applications
such as beamforming networks and MIMO communication can be envisioned.

4 Experimental Section
To verify the simulation results,
we fabricate one of the previously
designed ASPD prototypes with the dimensions of 27 cm × 27 cm
(including 27 × 27 meta-atoms) through printed circuit board
(PCB) technique on a commercial FR4 substrate (see Figure 11a). The ASPD has the thickness
of 3.2 mm and is terminated by a copper ground plane. In our experiments,
we designed, fabricated, and measured the ASPD design of Figure 10a, whereby the
incident power is spatially divided between two differently oriented
pencil beams with the power ratio level of 0.444 (−3.5 dB).
The experiments are totally performed in an anechoic chamber (Figure 11a) to avoid any
possible interference from the environment, and the schematic photograph
of the measurement setup (i.e., the NRL Arc setup64 for bistatic radar cross-section measurement) is illustrated
in Figure 11b. Two
X-band horn antennas covering the frequency bandwidth of 8.2 to 12.4
GHz were established in our tests whose locations and angular orientations
could be freely/precisely adjusted on the arc setup. One of the horn
antennas is responsible for exciting the ASPD from the normal direction,
while the other one moves along the arc curvature while recording
the cross-polarized amplitude of the far-field scattering pattern.
To provide a quasi-plane wave illumination, the feeding antenna was
located at the distance of about 2 m from the measured ASPD sample.
Due to the finite size of the sample and the nonplanar wavefront of
the feeding antenna, the phase compensation method was accomplished
during the ASPD design in the same manner given in ref.65 The ASPD sample was enveloped by pyramidal absorbing
materials to block possible edge diffractions. The vector network
analyzer 8720C (50 MHz–20 GHz) was connected to the horn antennas
to capture the transmission coefficients between them. A personal
computer with GPIB interface is also responsible for gathering the
far-field pattern data. According to the restrictions of our experimental
setup, the cross-polarized component of the far-field scattering pattern
was measured only in two principal planes. The noise effects were
removed to some extent by subtracting the results of the background
scene. In this manner, the measured far-field patterns were recorded
at 10 GHz, and the corresponding results are given in Figure 11c,d. As can be observed, the
measured beam angles in both perpendicular planes corroborate well
the simulation results (i.e., about θ = 19°). Most importantly,
the amplitude of the power pattern pertaining to the scattered beam
#1 is about 3.95 dB larger than that of the beam #2, which is in acceptable
accordance with our numerical and semi-analytical predictions illustrating
3.5 dB power difference. The little discrepancy between the simulated
and measured results can be attributed to the fabrication tolerances,
the dispersion of the substrate, and imperfections caused by our experimental
setup. Eventually, the proposed ASPD design operates well in arbitrary,
dividing the incident power between multiple spatial channels oriented
along our desired directions.
