Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) was synthesized by the sonochemical
method using 2-methoxyethanol as the solvent and subsequently decorated
onto graphene oxide (GO synthesized by the modified Hummers’
method) using two different approaches such as in situ growth and
ex situ synthesis followed by deposition. Preliminary characterizations
indicated that the synthesized CZTS belongs to the kesterite structure
with a sphere-like morphology. The in situ-synthesized CZTS/GO (I-CZTS/GO)
composite is used as an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution
reaction (HER) which revealed superior electrocatalytic activity with
a reduced overpotential (39.3 mV at 2 mA cm–2),
Tafel slope (70 mV dec–1), a larger exchange current
density of 908 mA cm–2, and charge transfer resistance
(5 Ω), significantly different from pure CZTS. Besides, the
I-CZTS/GO composite exhibits highest HER performance with high current
stability of which shows no noticeable degradation after i–t amperometry. The catalytic activity demonstrates
that the I-CZTS/GO composite could be a promising electrocatalyst
in hydrogen production from their cooperative interactions.

Introduction
Hydrogen (H2) is viewed as one of the promising energy
carriers, holding marvelous potential for clean and sustainable energy
technology.1 The most common ways for the
large-scale production of H2 includes natural gas reforming
and gasification of coal and petroleum coke, which lead to CO2 emission (greenhouse gas), and also, these processes are
not energy-efficient.2 H2 production
by splitting of water by the electrochemical method has attracted
attention of researchers because of having a simple and sustainable
way for it.3 Accordingly, to improve the
rate of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) below the overpotential,
Pt and Pt-based systems are commonly used. Unfortunately, their scarcity
and high cost hinder their large scale production.4 Thus, the development of equally efficient, abundant, nontoxic,
and nonprecious replacement electrocatalysts has become a main research
focus. For example, the most commonly used nonprecious HER catalysts
include transition-metal sulfides,5 phosphides,6 carbides,7 nitrides,8 and noble metal-free alloys.9 Even though most of the above listed systems usually suffer
from poor HER activity and stability, recently, it is well accepted
that the surface structure and their electrical conductivity are the
two key parameters that alter their HER activity.10 On the other hand, carbon materials (graphene, carbon nanotube,
fullerene C60, etc.) are ideal supports to further tune
their activities owing to their extraordinary physicochemical properties.11 Specifically, graphene, a few layer and two
dimensional carbon material, has attracted more attention as the supporting
material for HER catalysts.12 The use of
graphene as a support not only improves the conductivity of the hybrid
catalysts but also improves the dispersity because of their comparatively
huge active surface area. Hence, the graphene-based systems usually
show enhanced response toward HER.13 For
example, Niyitanga and Kyung Jeong reported that the MoS2/graphene oxide (GO) shows enhanced performance toward HER with respect
to MoS2.14 Yin et al. reported
that the activity of Ni–(MoS2/GO) is better than
that of Ni–GO and Ni–MoS2.15 Ma et al. also reported that the nanocomposite of CoP nanoparticle
reduced GO (rGO) shows HER with a low overpotential and high current
density with respect to pure CoP nanoparticles.10 Ma et al. found the MoS2NFs/rGO paper serves
as a freestanding, flexible, and durable working electrode, having
improved activity with respect to individual components toward HER.16 Recently, transition-metal chalcogenides including
MoS2,11c,17 WS2,18 Ni3S2,4a CoNi2Se4,19 and
NiFeS214 have justified to be
good HER electrocatalytic systems with high activity and low cost.
However, the complicated synthetic protocols and harsh conditions
of these chalcogenides limit their usage. In this manuscript, two
facile approaches (in situ and ex situ) are developed to synthesize
the novel CZTS/GO composite by the one-step sonochemical method. The
in situ-synthesized CZTS/GO (I-CZTS/GO) exhibits an enhanced activity
toward HER compared to pure CZTS and GO.

Results and Discussion
As shown in Scheme 1, the pathway for fabrication of the I-CZTS/GO electrocatalytic system
represents the metal precursors and the role of GO as the support
material which is further responsible for improving the HER activity
(detailed synthesis steps are explained in more detail in the Experimental Section).

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration
of Different Steps for Synthesis of I-CZTS/GO
Composites
Figure 1a shows
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of GO, CZTS, and I-CZTS/GO
over the range of 600–4000 cm–1. The characteristic
bands of GO are observed at 1025 cm–1 (C–O–C
stretching of epoxy groups), 1406 cm–1 (C–OH
stretching), 1615 cm–1 (C=C skeleton of graphitic
domains), 1725 cm–1 (C=O stretching of COOH
groups), and 3442 cm–1 (−O–H bending).20 The intensities of these oxygen-containing functional
groups decrease remarkably in the I-CZTS/GO composite sample, suggesting
that GO is nearly reduced. The characteristic functional groups of
CZTS were located in 1040, 1420, 1622, and 2351 cm–1, corresponding to the C=S stretching, coupled vibrations
of C=N stretching, N–H bending, and S–H thiol
functionality, respectively, which are in agreement with the literature
values.21 On the other hand, the above
assigned peaks were also observed in the I-CZTS/GO composites but
with reduced intensity or disappearance, which indicates that the
oxygenated functional groups in GO were reduced partially.

GO (black), (II) CZTS (red), and (III) I-CZTS/GO composite (pink).

The phase purity and crystalline
nature of the synthesized material
have been confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Figure 1b shows the XRD patterns of GO, CZTS, and
the I-CZTS/GO composite. The XRD pattern of GO portrays a distinct
peak at (002), similar to few-layer graphene.22 It is obvious that the XRD patterns of pure CZTS would show the
characteristic peaks at (112), (200), (220), and (312) crystal planes
of the kesterite structure of CZTS (JCPDS card no. 26-0575).23 Moreover, the GO/CZTS nanocomposites possess
the XRD pattern with the peaks observed at (002) (112), (200), (220),
and (312), corresponding to the diffraction planes of mixed GO and
CZTS. However, the composite shows peaks with lower intensities than
those for pure CZTS. This is possible when graphene is wrapped around
the surface of the CZTS particles,24 which
could further induce crystal diffraction. Figure 1c shows the XRD patterns of the CZTS/GO composite
with varying amounts of GO loading in CZTS, that is, 0.025, 0.050,
0.075, and 0.1 g. It is observed that the peak intensity gradually
increases with increasing GO loading, particularly for the (002) plane
of GO. Similarly, four pronounced diffraction planes at (112), (200),
(220), and (312) of CZTS were also observed. Raman spectra measurements
were performed to obtain a more precise assignment of the structure
of GO, CZTS, and CZTS/GO composites, and the results are shown in Figure 1d. The Raman profile
of GO shows the presence of bands at 1355 and 1589 cm–1, which correspond to D and G bands, respectively. The characteristic
peak of CZTS at 333 cm–1 was assigned to the A1
mode, which is the strongest mode observed from kesterite CZTS. For
the CZTS/GO composite, all the Raman bands for CZTS and GO were observed.
Moreover, in the present study, the D and G bands for the CZTS/GO
composite appeared at 1360 and 1594 cm–1, respectively.
When CZTS NPs are decorated on GO, the intensity of the D band is
found to increase relative to the G band, and both the bands shift
to higher wavenumbers could be due to their restrictive moments after
CZTS deposition on graphene.24 The XRD
patterns accompanied with Raman spectra demonstrate the fact that
the CZTS/GO composite material is obtained after the sonochemical
process in this work.

Field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM) images in Figure 2a–d demonstrates
the surface morphologies of GO sheets, pure CZTS, and I-CZTS/GO composite,
respectively. From the FESEM image in Figure 2a, the layered structure of the stacked GO
sheets is observed with wrinkles all over the surface of GO sheets.25 The solid GO sample is severely agglomerated
because of its high specific surface area. Figure 2b shows an FESEM image of pure CZTS, and
it reveals that the morphology of CZTS is sphere-like and homogenously
distributed with a narrow diameter of about 250–300 nm.21a As for the I-CZTS/GO nanocomposites shown in Figure 2c, it can be clearly
observed that the CZTS spheres were well dispersed in the graphene
framework with no obvious aggregation, and the majority of these CZTS
spheres were wrapped with graphene nanosheets.24 Further, to know the presence of CZTS on GO, the EDX spectrum
was recorded for the I-CZTS/GO composites. The composition of the
I-CZTS/GO composites is summarized with the recorded spectrum as shown
in Figure 2d. The studies
confirm that the presence of Cu, Zn, Sn, S, and carbon peaks represent
the graphene.26 Moreover, the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) image in Figure 2e clearly shows the CZTS particles wrapped
in graphene sheets with a size of 225–300 nm, which is consistent
with the observation from SEM images of CZTS/GO composites.

and the inset shows 100 nm scale bar.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses (Figure 3) were performed
to further
investigate the surface composition and chemical states of the I-CZTS/GO
composite.27 Accordingly, the XPS survey
spectrum shown in Figure 3d identifies the presence of Cu, Zn, Sn, S, and C in the CZTS/GO.
The broad signal (Figure 3a) having binding energy from 520 to 540 eV corresponding
to O 1s could be due to different oxygen containing functionalities
available on GO. Moreover, Figure 3b C–O and C–C peaks appear with a strong
signal and the O=C–O peak as a shoulder at 286.1, 283.8,
and 288.5 eV, respectively.28Figure 3c shows two peaks
at 933.9 and 953.7 eV in XPS spectra which were assigned to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 with a splitting energy of 20.5 eV,
corresponding to Cu(I). Moreover, the Zn(II) state was identified
from the peaks at 1022.6 and 1044.5 eV with a splitting energy of
23.2 eV. The sharp Sn 3d peaks located at 486.6 and 495.1 eV with
a peak separation of 8.5 eV confirmed the Sn(IV) state. The overlapping
of sulfur 2p1/2 peaks were identified at 163.4 eV, which
agreed with the sulfide phase in the range of 160 to 164 eV.29 As can be seen from the XPS spectra, no other
valences such as Cu(II) and Sn(II) were found corresponding to that
of secondary phases CuS and Cu2SnS3. These XPS
results are in good agreement with the reported literature.23 The CZTS and I-CZTS/GO were further investigated
by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method to calculate
the specific surface area, and the nitrogen adsorption/desorption
isotherms are shown in Figure S1. The CZTS
exhibits a relatively low BET specific surface area of 2.016 m2 g, whereas the surface area is higher (6.553 m2 g) for the I-CZTS/GO composite because of the presence of graphene
with the large surface area. The enhanced specific surface area provides
efficient active sites and better transport pathways for charged ions,
which is beneficial for the improvement of electrochemical performance
of the composite. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda pore size
distribution indicates the high degree of uniformity of pores in the
range of 3.578 nm for CZTS and 5.237 nm for I-CZTS/GO. Although the
pore diameter for both samples is comparable, a larger pore diameter
in I-CZTS/GO suggests more effective active sites leading to enhanced
electrocatalytic activity. .It is in good agreement with the other
findings from microscopy and spectroscopy data.

Electrocatalytic Performance toward HER
Electrocatalytic
performance toward HER, of I-CZTS/GO composites, pure CZTS, and GO
were examined using the three electrode system, where glassy carbon
electrode (GCE), Pt foil, and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) are
working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively, in 0.5 M
H2SO4 solution. Previous to linear sweep voltammetry
(LSV) measurements, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out to steady
or drench the electrocatalysts in the electrolyte; the results are
shown in Figure S2. Figure 4a superimposed LSV polarization curves of
Pt, I-CZTS/GO composites, pure CZTS, and bare GO electrodes at a scan
rate of 50 mV s–1. As jurisdiction, the electrochemical
performances for Pt and bare GCE electrodes were also examined for
comparison and apparently, Pt demonstrates very small overpotential,
indicating the superior electrocatalytic activity for HER,32 while the bare GCE electrode shows very high
overpotential confirming its negligible catalytic activity. I-CZTS/GO
represents the overpotentials distinctly lower than CZTS.

(black), CZTS (red) I-CZTS/GO (pink), and Pt (blue), (b) corresponding
to the Tafel plot of CZTS (red), I-CZTS/GO (pink), and Pt (blue).
(c) Nyquist plot of the GO (black), CZTS (red), I-CZTS/GO (pink),
and (d) the durability test of I-CZTS/GO in 0.5 M H2SO4 using Pt foil and SCE as a counter and reference electrode,
respectively.

Significantly, I-CZTS/GO
shows an onset overpotential of 39.3 mV
at 2 mA cm–2 and overpotentials of 53.1 and 97 mV
to afford current densities of 10 and 20 mA cm–2, respectively. The catalytic activity is higher than the former
reported catalysts used in HER.17a,30 Demonstrating
the performances of CZTS and GO electrodes exhibits inferior HER activities
as compared to I-CZTS/GO composites. The improved electrochemical
performance of CZTS/GO composites can be credited to the electronic
as well as chemical pairing between the CZTS and GO supporter14,16 (see the schematic in Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Schematic of HER on the I-CZTS/GO Composite
Figure S4 demonstrates the comparison
between I-CZTS/GO composites with varying amounts of GO loading, that
is, 0.025, 0.050, 0.075, and 0.1 g. The GO synthesized CZTS/GO composite
(0.075 g) shows a better result compared to all other loadings; hence,
it is taken for all other studies. Figure 4b revealing the Tafel slope is the main index
for evaluating HER performance, and a lower Tafel slope leads to a
faster increment of the HER rate with rising overpotential. The linear
portions of the Tafel plots were fitted by the Tafel equation (η
= b log j + a,
where j is the current density and b is the Tafel slope), and I-CZTS/GO exhibits a Tafel slope of 70
mV dec–1 as shown in Figure 4b. The value is higher than 36 mV dec–1 for the Pt,31 while it
is much lower than 85 mV dec–1 for pure CZTS and
moreover, most of the reported values for non-noble metal HER catalysts,
such as MoS2 alone,32 MoS2CFs,33 bare CoS2,34 and other nonprecious metal catalysts are listed
in (Table 1) The exchange
current density (j0) of the HER on I-CZTS/GO
is obtained to be 908 mA cm–2, higher than that
of pure CZTS (882 mA cm–2) and also outperforming
many reported non-noble metal HER catalysts.35 These results indicate the high catalytic activity of I-CZTS/GO
with respect to most of the nonprecious systems from the literature.
The LSV polarization curves of the I-CZTS/GO composite at various
scan rates are shown in Figure S5, and
it can be seen that the current density increases from 133 to 164
mA cm–2 with the rising scan rate from 10 to 100
mV s–1 at a potential of −0.3 V versus the
reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), showing that the catalytic activity
of I-CZTS/GO composites toward HER is fewer pretentious by scan rates,
which indicates interfacial electron transfer is diffusion controlled.10 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
measurements were carried out to understand the role of electrode
kinetics and interface reaction of CZTS and its GO composites on HER.

Superimposed Nyquist plots for CZTS-based
systems are shown in Figure 4c. The observed variable
semicircles are because of having different charge transfer resistance
(Rct) capabilities at the electrified
interface. Interestingly, from the data fitting, it has been confirmed
that the I-CZTS/GO presents lower Rct of
(5 Ω) in comparison to CZTS (17 Ω), indicating
enhancement in the electron transfer which goes to enhance HER from
cooperative features with GO of CZTS.52 Moreover, the catalytic stability of the I-CZTS/GO composite was
also evaluated and is shown in Figure 4d. Accordingly, the LSV polarization curves of I-CZTS/GO
demonstrating parallel polarization initially and after i–t amperometry, revealing merely a negligible
decrease of current density (∼9 mA cm–2)
and signifying that the I-CZTS/GO composite catalyst possesses superior
long-standing constancy and is in good agreement with other electrochemical
data and morphological studies. The catalyst contaminant from the
electrode may contribute to the slight loss in catalytic activity.35b,53 The inset of Figure 4d shows the performance of 5000 s of i–t amperometry for stability test. Fascinatingly, morphological
features of CZTS/GO by TEM after the i–t measurements are shown in Figure S6, and no harsh corrosion was found even after a long-term operation
of the potential in acidic medium at an applied potential. It signifies
that the CZTS/GO is morphologically and structurally stable and having
extraordinarily performance toward HER.

In real, the actual
efficiency of the electrocatalytic systems
were studied using the turnover frequency (TOF), which represents
the number of hydrogen molecules produced per second per active site.
TOF can be determined by BET surface area (6.553 m2/g)
of the I-CZTS/GO catalyst. The calculated TOF of H2 molecules
are 1.677 s–1 at η = 250 mV. (Details of calculations
and comparison with the literature are given in Table S2 in the Supporting Information). Interestingly, to confirm
further and support our justification about the HER response to I-CZTS/GO,
the LSV polarization curve using graphite as the counter electrode
instead of Pt (to further check the oxidation of counter electrode
Pt and deposition of the working electrode) and found insignificant
change in overpotential (Figure S3).

For supporting the observations, we employed the ex situ method
for the synthesis of the CZTS/GO (E-CZTS/GO) composite using the facial
sonochemical method as shown in the schematic (Scheme S1), and Figure S7a XRD
pattern shows E-CZTS/GO. All the diffraction peaks in the XRD patterns
of E-CZTS/GO are consistent with the tetragonal phase kesterite CZTS
(JCPDS no 26-0575) and (002) plane reliable with GO Figure S7b. The Raman spectra of CZTS/GO composites showed
G (1586 cm–1) and D (1350 cm–1) band structures of carbon, suggesting that the structure of graphene
was maintained in the composites. The signal at 332.8 cm–1 could be assigned to the CZTS. Figure S8 shows morphology of E-CZTS/GO, and it is clearly seen that CZTS
nanoparticles are distributed on GO, indicating that GO is giving
support to CZTS and providing an efficient electrical network for
electron transport during HER. Figure S9a–d shows that the E-CZTS/GO composite exhibited good catalytic activity
for HER, and its scan rate-dependent polarization is shown in Figure S10. The overpotential of the composite
was found to decrease from −0.8 mV of CZTS to −0.4 mV
of the composite, with its low Tafel slope at 95 mV/dec, fast charge
transfer resistance (12 Ω), and good stability after 1000 CV
cycles, without any change in features of polarization curves. However,
slight decay of current density is observed, indicating that the E-CZTS/GO
composite catalyst retains excellent long-term stability.

Conclusions
In summary, CZTS was modified with GO by a simple sonochemical
method; the GO does not influence the crystal phase of CZTS but makes
it more dispersed. The I-CZTS/GO composite displays extraordinarily
high electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen generation reaction, and
the overpotential of this electrode is ∼39.3 mV with a Tafel
slope of ∼70 mV/decade. Moreover, this electrode exhibits good
stability with negligible current lost in the durability test. It
is believed that the incorporation of graphene enhances the charge
transfer abilities, improving the electrocatalytic H2 evolution.
The composite has lower resistance compared to GO in the all frequency
region, demonstrating the faster transport of electrons for HER. The
I-CZTS/GO composite possessed high electrocatalytic activity and excellent
stability. Therefore, it could be a strong candidate of the HER catalyst.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals and Materials
Graphite fine powder (extra
pure), H2SO4, HNO3, HCl, copper chloride,
zinc chloride, tin chloride, thioacetamide, 2-methoxyethanol, monoethanolamine,
and absolute ethanol of AR grade. All the chemicals were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, and others were used without any further purification.

Preparation of GO
GO was synthesized according to the
modified Hummers’ method. In brief, 1 g of graphite powder
was added in 3:1 H2SO4/HNO3 under
continuous stirring in ice bath for 30 min and further sonicated for
6 h at room temperature. The suspension was refluxed in an oil bath
for 24 h. The mixture was then repeatedly centrifuged and washed in
succession with water, 30% HCl solution, and deionized (DI) water.

Synthesis of CZTS Nanoparticles
CZTS nanoparticles
were synthesized using the sonochemical method which is previously
reported in our paper.54 Briefly, for the
preparation of sol Cu/Zn/Sn/TAA/monoethanolamine (MEA), (2:1:1:4:1)
molar proportion was taken. Initially, 1 mol of CuCl2 was
liquefied in 100 mL of 2-methoxyethanol under stirring for 30 min
followed by addition of 0.5 mol each of SnCl4 and ZnCl2 simultaneously into the solution followed by stirring for
next 30 min to get clear precursor solution. Further, 2 mol thiol–alkane–amine
(TAA) and a suitable quantity of monoethanolamine was added till the
solution turned dark brown followed by sonication for next 1.5 h and
the final black precipitate was obtained. This precipitate was then
repeatedly washed by absolute ethanol to remove the unreacted reactant
and other impurities and then annealed at 170 °C for 2 h.

Synthesis
of in Situ CZTS/GO Composite
As-synthesized
GO is dispersed in 100 mL of 2-methoxyethanol under vigorous stirring
for 2 h to ensure good dispersion. The metal precursors, 1 M CuCl2, 0.5 M ZnCl2, and 0.5 M SnCl4 were
added in above solution with constant stirring for another 30 min
to get a clear solution. To this solution, 2 M TAA and appropriate
quantity of MEA was added under continuous stirring till the solution
turned dark brown. This solution was then put into an ultrasonic bath
for next 3 h to achieve the black precipitate. The precipitate was
repeatedly washed using absolute ethanol to remove the excess TAA
and other physiadsorbed counter ions and then annealed at 170 °C
(decomposition temperature) for 2 h.

Synthesis of Ex Situ CZTS/GO
Composite
The synthesized
CZTS (0.3 mg) was dispersed in 10 mL of 2-methoxyethanol. Then, 0.1
mg of GO and 0.4 mL of MEA was added to the above solution, and the
mixture was stirred for 2 h and subsequently the precursor solution
was put into an ultrasonic bath for 3 h at room temperature (RT).
The final solution was filtered with an equal volume of ethanol. The
obtained product was washed two times with ethanol and annealed at
170 °C for 1 h. These in situ and ex situ CZTS/GO were further
characterized and used for electrocatalytic HER studies.

Material Characterizations
The product was analyzed
by FTIR. The phase and structure were characterized using XRD (Siemens
D-5005 diffractometer) equipped with an X-ray tube (Cu Kα1; λ = 1.5418 nm, 40 kV, 30 mA, with a step size of 0.01°).
FESEM and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) SPECS HSA-3500 with
a monochromatic X-ray source of Al Kα radiation and hemispherical
analyzer were used to investigate the elemental states of the sample.
Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed by Raman optics with
the microscope, Seki Technotron Corp. Tokyo with a 532 nm laser. The
electrochemical and electrocatalytic studies were performed using
the three-electrode system with the electrochemical workstation (CHI-Instrument
660E, USA).

Electrochemical Measurements
The
electrocatalytic HER
performance of the above as-synthesized samples was tested by CV,
LSV, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis on
an electrochemical workstation (CHI-660E) using a three-electrode
system, a modified GCE (3 mm in dia.) as a working electrode, and
SCE and Pt foil as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively.
Prior to use, the GCE was polished by sequential use of 1, 0.3, and
0.05 μm alumina powders, followed by sonication in DI and methanol
for 5 min each to remove inorganic and organic impurities. The working
electrode was fabricated using 5.0 mg of the catalyst dispersed into
a mixture of solvent containing 100:1 of isopropanol/Nafion (5 wt
%) solution and then the mixture was sonicated for ∼30 min
to form a homogeneous ink. Afterward, 10 μL (0.41 mg loading
normalized to current density) of the catalytic ink was loaded onto
the GCE and dried naturally at RT. CV and LSV were conducted in aqueous
0.5 M H2SO4 electrolytic solutions, and all
the results were further reported with respect to RHE in 0.5 M H2SO4E(RHE) = E(SCE) + 0.244 V. EIS measurements were carried out from 1 000 000
to 0.002 Hz.
