Nanogels
have been widely used in biomedical applications, such
as carriers for hyperthermia cancer treatment, drug delivery, and
imaging. Owing to the enhanced permeability and retention effect,
nanogels have shown a great potential in cancer therapy. In this study,
sodium copper chlorophyllin (SCC), a low cytotoxicity and biodegradable
photothermal agent, was copolymerized with a nanogel of N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]methacrylamide. The nanogels could produce
heat under exposure to a green laser with a 532 nm wavelength. The
positively charged nature of the nanogels enhanced the endocytosis
of the nanogels. The cell mortality was greatly enhanced with the
treatment of the SCC-containing nanogels and green light illumination.
Our results suggest the potential of SCC-containing nanogels in photothermal
cancer therapy.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Cancer
remains one of the most frequent causes of mortality in
developed countries, and the incidence of cancer keeps elevating because
of increasing aged population.1 Traditional
cancer treatments, such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy,
still have some shortcomings, such as the risks of killing normal
cells or destroying the immune systems of the patients.2 Owing to the advantage of minimal invasiveness,
hyperthermia therapy has been developed as an alternative technique
for cancer treatment.3,4 Hyperthermia cancer therapy is
based on localized heating, which in turn raises the temperature around
the targeted tumor tissues to 41–45 °C.5 As cancerous cells are more vulnerable to elevated temperatures
than normal cells, hyperthermia may kill cancer cells with a minimal
damage to adjacent normal tissues. One type of hyperthermia therapies
is photothermal therapy (PTT), using electromagnetic radiation to
induce heat from a photothermal agent.6 The efficacy of hyperthermia induced by photothermal agents has
been shown to be higher than those of traditional hyperthermia methods.7 Many researchers have attempted to transfer the
photothermal agents into cancerous tissues via nanocarriers.8 Because of their excellent stability, easy preparation,
and high designability, nanogels with chemically cross-linked networks
have been widely used as polymeric nanovesicles for therapeutic agents.9,10 Incorporation of photothermal agents to a nanogel would be beneficial
for in vivo applications because it would improve
the cellular uptake of photothermal agents and thus enhance the efficiency
of hyperthermia.11,12

The most used electromagnetic
radiation for PTT is near-infrared
(NIR) light,7,13 which can penetrate into deeper
biological soft tissues.14 One disadvantage
associated with the NIR light is that the absorption of NIR light
by water is higher than that of the light within the spectrum between
300 and 800 nm wavelength.15 Visible light,
though with a lower tissue penetration depth, has been used in certain
medical procedures16 and might be applied
to PTT. For example, green light (495–570 nm) has been applied
for decades in several clinical treatments, including ocular disorders
and benign prostatic hyperplasia.17,18 Several recent
studies demonstrated that green light can be absorbed by metallic
nanoparticles (NPs), leading to excitations in the form of localized
surface plasmon resonance and driving a photothermal effect.19−21 Therefore, we would like to study the potential application of green
light in PTT.

The objective of this work is to synthesize a
polymeric nanogel
containing green light-activated photothermal agents and then to evaluate
its potential application in PTT. Porphyrin-containing molecules,
such as protoporphyrin IX, tetra(meso-hydroxy)phenyl chlorin, and
sodium copper chlorophyllin (SCC), absorb green light and generate
heat. Among the porphyrin molecules, SCC, a low-cytotoxicity and biodegradable
photosensitizer with high photothermal conversion efficiency,22,23 was chosen as the photothermal agent in this study. A nanogel composed
of N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]methacrylamide (NDPMA)
and SCC was synthesized. The positively charged NDPMA with tertiary
amines could facilitate the nanogel to access cells via electrostatic
attractions with the negatively charged cell membrane.24 The photothermal effect of SCC-containing nanogels
via green laser illumination was studied for its cell-killing efficacy in vitro.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Cytotoxicity of SCC
The cytotoxicity
of SCC was first evaluated to determine whether or not it is suitable
as a photothermal agent. The IC50 value of SCC was determined
as 0.63 mM (Figure 1). When the SCC concentration was below 0.10 mM, the cell viability
was beyond 90%. Therefore, if the amount of SCC in the nanogels is
less than 0.10 mM, the nanogel should be considered to exhibit low
cytotoxicity.

Figure 1 Cytotoxicity assay of SCC. The values are presented as
mean ±
standard deviation (n = 5).

2.2 Fabrication and Characterization of SCC-Containing
Nanogels
Two types of nanogels were synthesized, polyNDPMA
(abbreviated as NDP) and poly(NDPMA-co-SCC) (abbreviated
as NDPC). The nanogels with the SCC weight ratio of 10% or 20% were
named as NDPC10 or NDPC20, respectively. First
of all, we tried to use proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) to characterize the incorporation of SCC during the polymerization
of NDPMA. However, the incorporation of SCC seems to interfere with
the 1H NMR signals (Figure S1). The intensities of the NMR signals of NDPC20 were much
weaker than those of NDP and NDPC10. Several studies suggested
that Cu(II), a paramagnetic ion, broadens or weakens the nuclear resonance
via paramagnetic relaxation effects.25−27 We suspect that the
magnetic properties of Cu ions in SCC interfere with the 1H NMR signals. Therefore, 1H NMR is not suitable for the
quantitative analysis of SCC in the nanogels.

In this study,
we used two methods for the determination of SCC contents in the nanogels.
First, the contents of SCC in the nanogels were determined according
to its absorbance at 405 nm, based on a calibration curve of free
SCC (Figure S2). The amounts of SCC in
NDPC were roughly 9.8 and 19.7 wt %, with the addition of 7 and 21
mg SCC, respectively. Herein, NDP, NDPC10, and NDPC20 denote the nanogels containing 0, 9.8, and 19.7 wt % SCC,
respectively. Second, the content of Cu(II) in the SCC-containing
nanogels was evaluated by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission
spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The concentrations of copper ions were ∼3.3
and 8.73 μg/mg nanogels (equivalent to 8.2 and 21.7 wt % SCC)
in NDPC10 and NDPC20, respectively. The SCC
contents determined by the two methods are close.

The average
diameters of NDP, NDPC10, and NDPC20, determined
by dynamic light scattering (DLS), were around 254 ±
75, 215 ± 90, and 308 ± 120 nm, respectively (Figure 2). The size distributions of
NDPC10 and NDPC20 were broader than that of
NDP. Beside the major peaks around 215–308 nm, minor peaks
below 100 nm appeared in the spectra of NDPC10 and NDPC20, suggesting that SCC interferes with the polymerization
of NDPMA, resulting in a broader size distribution. The zeta potential
measurement shows that NDP, NDPC10, and NDPC20 exhibited positive surface charges at 43.1, 49.2, and 38.9 mV, respectively,
resulting from the tertiary amines of NDPMA. It should be noted that
the nanogels with different sizes may have different SCC compositions,
which will affect their photothermal properties, endocytosis, and
cytotoxicity. However, the separation of nanogels with different sizes
is tedious; so, we used the mixtures in the preliminary study.

of different nanogels.

2.3 Cytotoxicity of the Nanogels
In this
study, a positively charged monomer, NDPMA, was used for the preparation
of nanogels because it is well-known that macromolecules containing
positive charges tend to be endocytosed. However, positively charged
macromolecules are notorious for their cytotoxicity.28 As this is a proof-of-concept study, NDPMA was used for
the testing.

MTS analysis indicates that the IC50 values of NDP, NDPC10, and NDPC20 were estimated
to be about 145, 140, and 125 μg/mL, respectively (Figure 3). The results demonstrate
the cytotoxicity of the NDPMA-based nanogels, which is the reason
for the 2 h, instead of 24 h, incubation time in this cytotoxicity
test. Thus, we picked a concentration below the IC50 value
of 100 μg/mL to test the photothermal response and evaluate
whether or not the concentration is sufficient for hyperthermia treatment.

medium containing various amounts of nanogels for 2 h. The cell viability
was determined using an MTS assay. The data are represented as mean
± standard deviation, n = 3.

2.4 Photothermal Property of
the Nanogels
The photothermal property of SCC–NDP
was estimated from the
temperature increase of the nanogel solution after the illumination
of green laser (532 nm) for a certain period. Water does not absorb
green light; so, the temperature rise was ignored or limited, especially
at the laser intensity below 3 W (Figure 4A). The illumination of 4 W green laser for
4 min merely raised the water temperature by ∼2 °C. Similarly,
NDP did not raise the water temperature after green laser illumination
(Figure 4B). By contrast,
the nanogels containing SCC absorb green laser energy and convert
into heat to raise the water temperature. The extent of temperature
rise is increased with the SCC contents at the same laser intensity.
The water temperature was raised by ∼11 or ∼17 °C
for NDPC10 or NDPC20, after a 4 min illumination
of 3 W green laser (Figure 4C,D). The results reveal that NDPC generates heat efficiently,
leading to a significant temperature elevation, which is sufficient
for PTT. The measured temperature is the average temperature of the
solution; so, the temperature at the sites of SCC-containing nanogels
should be even higher. As the water temperature rise does not occur
by the illumination of green laser below 3 W, the laser intensity
was applied for the subsequent photothermal experiments.

at 532 nm. The nanogel concentration was 100 μg/mL.

2.5 Cellular Uptake of the
Nanogels
Our
proposed mechanism for the photothermal effect is that the SCC-containing
nanogels first enter a cell and then generate heat to kill the cell
upon illumination of green laser (Scheme 1). Thus, it is important to verify the cellular
uptake of NDPCs.

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration of the Experimental Procedure
First, the cellular uptake
of NDPC nanogels was evaluated by the
determination of Cu contents in the cells. After the L929 cells were
cultured with 100 μg/mL of NDPC10 or NDPC20, the cells contain about 0.526 or 0.772 ppm Cu(II), respectively.
However, the cells incubated with NDP without SCC also contained 0.346
ppm Cu(II), which should come from the intrinsic copper ions in the
cells. For example, cytochrome c oxidase, a transmembrane
protein complex found in mitochondria, contains two copper centers.29,30 After being subtracted from the intrinsic Cu(II), the NDPC-associated
copper could be used for the estimation of cellular uptake of NDPC
nanogels. We estimated that each cell engulfed 10 pg of NDPC10 or 9.3 pg of NDPC20.

Because the high level of
cellular intrinsic Cu ions might interfere
with the determination of the amount of engulfed NDPs, the cellular
uptake of NDPs was also evaluated via the incorporation of gold NPs
(AuNPs). AuNP–NDP nanogels were imaged using transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) (Figure S3), showing that
AuNP is encapsulated in the nanogel. The average diameter of AuNP–NDP
was around 190 nm, determined by DLS (Figure S4).

The contents of cell-internalized AuNP–NDP nanogels
were
extracted from the cells and the amount of Au was determined using
ICP-AES. The total amount of cell-internalized gold from AuNP–NDPs
was 8.5 ppm, whereas that from free AuNP was merely 0.1 ppm. When
the concentrations were translated into the number of NPs, assuming
that the diameter of the AuNPs is ∼80 nm, each cell, on average,
engulfed 3579 or 42 AuNPs from the AuNP-containing nanogels or free
AuNP, respectively. The result indicates that the positively charged
AuNP-containing nanogels significantly enhances the cellular uptake
of AuNP–NDP by ∼85-fold in comparison to free AuNP.
The electrostatic interaction between the positively charged NDPMA-based
nanogels and negatively charged phospholipid bilayer of cell membranes
increases the internalization of the nanogels.31

2.6 Green Laser-Induced Cell
Death of Nanogels
The L929 cells were incubated with NDP
or NDPC20 (100
μg/mL) and then irradiated by green laser. The Live/Dead staining
indicated that some of the cells (∼20%) incubated with NDP
were killed without the illumination of green light (Figure 5A). However, the combination
of green light irradiation did not further increase cell death in
the presence of NDP (Figure 5B). The observation indicates that green light illumination
does not damage the cells. In contrast, cell death was increased significantly
in the cells incubated with NDPC20 during the green laser
irradiation. After 5 min of exposure to a 3 W green laser, cell mortality
increased from ∼25% to more than 80% (Figure 5B). The cell mortality also increased with
an increasing intensity of green laser. Green laser (5 min) illumination
caused ∼65 and ∼80% cell death at the intensities of
1 and 3 W, respectively (Figure 5B). Our results indicate that NDPC20 could
generate heat with green laser illumination and then kill cells.

Green laser-induced cell death of NDP (solid line) or NDPC20 (dashed line) with different power densities and illumination times
(n = 3, *p < 0.001 in comparison
with the nonilluminated samples).

This study is a proof-of-concept demonstration of the cell-killing
ability of endocytosed chlorophyllin-containing nanogels via the heat
induced by green laser illumination. To test our concept, a positively
charged nanogel was synthesized for the facilitation of cellular uptake.
Although the endocytosis of NDPC is demonstrated, the intrinsic cytotoxicity
of positively charged nanogels also results in the mortality of the
cells. Nevertheless, the illumination of green laser greatly enhances
cell mortality, suggesting the feasibility of green laser-induced
thermal therapy. Furthermore, several studies indicated that cancer
cells are more vulnerable to heat than normal cells.32 Thus, we propose that the nanogels containing SCC are potential
candidates for hyperthermia in cancer treatment.

In the future,
we will design SCC-containing nanogels to specifically
target cancer cells. To decrease the nonspecific interactions of nanogels
with cells and tissues, antifouling materials,33 such as polyethylene glycol (PEG)34 and zwitterionic polymers,35 would be
used to synthesize nanogels. Such nanogels could avoid the undesirable
endocytosis of nanogels in normal cells. Furthermore, to enhance the
accumulation of nanogels at the sites of action, the nanogels could
be conjugated with peptides and protein,36 galactose,37 or coated with cell membranes,38 leading to specific cell endocytosis. Therefore,
chlorophyllin-containing nanogels could enter tumors with minimal
damages to the normal tissues.

3 Conclusions
A nanogel containing SCC was successfully synthesized for potential
application in photothermal therapies. Although the intrinsic positive
charges of NDP-based nanogels cause cytotoxicity, the mortality of
L929 cells incubated with NDPC nanogel was enhanced by 60% after green
laser exposure, whereas that with NDP was not increased by green laser
illumination. We hope this work could shed light on the development
of nanocarriers for photothermal clinical therapy in the future.

city, Taiwan.

4.2 Synthesis and Purification
of Nanogels
Two types of nanogels, NDP and NDPC, were synthesized
via inverse
miniemulsion polymerization in a water-in-oil system, as described
previously.40 NDPMA (80 mg), 10 mg PEGDA,
and 10 mg APS were dissolved in 3 mL of deionized (DI) water. The
monomer solution was mixed with 20 mL of hexane containing 1 g Span
80 and then sealed in a glass tube. The reaction mixture was purged
with nitrogen for 30 min and then sonicated for 5 min to form small
micelles. Polymerization of the monomers was initiated at 60 °C
and proceeded for 2 h. For the synthesis of NDPC, 7 or 21 mg SCC was
added in the monomer solution prior to the mixing with the Span 80
solution. After the reaction, the detergent was removed by the addition
of 5 mL of acetone into the reaction mixture, followed by centrifugation
at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. The precipitate was further dispersed in
a mixture of 30 mL of hexane/5 mL of acetone and then centrifuged
at 14,000 rpm for 20 min two times for further removal of the residual
detergent. The precipitate was suspended in DI water and then filtered
through 0.45 and 0.22 μm syringe filters sequentially. The product
was dialyzed against DI water and lyophilized. The nanogels were stored
at 4 °C before use.

4.3 Characterization of the
Nanogels
The size distribution and surface charge of the
nanogels were analyzed
by a Zetasizer Nano ZS DLS instrument (Malvern, U.K.) at room temperature.
The amount of SCC in NDPC was quantified using a UV–visible
spectroscope (CARY 100nc, Agilent, USA). Briefly, 1 mg of nanogels
was dispersed in 1 mL of DI water by 20 min of sonication, and then
the absorbance at 405 nm was measured. The SCC content of NDPC was
determined according to a standard curve obtained from the absorbance
of SCC solutions with known concentrations. 1H NMR experiments
were performed on a Bruker ADVANCE-500 MHz FT NMR spectrometer (500
MHz) using D2O as the solvent (1 mg/mL) at ambient temperature,
and tetramethyl silane was used as the internal standard. The copper
ion concentration was determined from the dissolved nanogels in DI
water and analyzed using ICP-AES (Optima 8000, PerkinElmer, USA).

The AuNPs were incorporated into the nanogels through vigorous mixing.39 Briefly, AuNP–NDP complexes were prepared
by stirring a solution of AuNPs (100 ppm) and NDP (0.9 mg/mL) vigorously
for 4 days, followed by dialysis against DI water for 2 days, and
then freeze-drying. The incorporation of AuNPs in the complexes was
demonstrated via TEM imaging.

4.4 Cytotoxicity
of SCC and Nanogels
The L929 cells were seeded on a 96-well
plate at a density of 2 ×
104 cells/cm2 and cultured for 24 h. The culture
medium was then replaced by a culture medium containing various amounts
of nanogels or SCC for 2 or 24 h, respectively. The cell viability
was evaluated using an MTS assay. A fresh culture medium was used
as the negative control, whereas the medium supplemented with 0.5%
phenol was used as the positive control. The solution in each well
was replaced by 100 μL of fresh medium and 20 μL of MTS
reagents. After 3 h of incubation, the absorbance of the solution
was determined at 570 nm (OD570) and 630 nm (OD630) using an ELISA reader (Model EL800, BIO-TEK, USA). The relative
cell viability was calculated using the following equation  

4.5 Photothermal Properties
of the Nanogels
The nanogel solutions in the cell culture
medium (100 μg/mL)
were illuminated with a green laser at 532 nm wavelength (Class IV
laser product, Changchun New Industries Optoelectronics Tech. Co.,
Ltd., China). A thermocouple (1 mm in diameter) was inserted into
the center of a 1 mL nanogel solution, and the temperature was measured
before and immediately after green laser illumination.

4.6 Determination of Cellular Uptake of the Nanogels
To
evaluate the cellular uptake of the nanogels, the L929 cells,
precultured in a culture dish to almost confluence, were fed with
0.1 mg/mL of either NDPC or Au-incorporated NDPC. The contents of
the copper ions chelated in SCC and of the AuNPs embedded in NDP nanogels
were quantified by ICP-AES (Optima 8000, PerkinElmer, USA). After
2 h of incubation, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and harvested from the dish. For copper quantification, the
cells were dispersed in DI water, sonicated for several hours, and
then filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter. For gold quantification,
the cells were digested by 10 M aqua regia (a mixture of nitric acid
and hydrochloric acid in a molar ratio of 1:3) for 2 h. Then, the
contents of Cu or Au in the sample solutions were analyzed using ICP-AES.

4.7 Mortality of L929 Cells Treated with the Nanogels
under Green Laser Illumination
The L929 cells were cultured
on 24-well plates until almost confluence. The culture medium was
replaced by a nanogel-containing culture medium (100 μg nanogel/mL)
and then incubated for 2 h. The samples were then rinsed with PBS
twice to remove the free nanogels. The samples were then irradiated
with green laser at various intensities (1, 2, or 3 W/cm2) and illumination times (1–5 min). After the green laser
illumination, the cell mortality was examined via MTS assay and Live/Dead
staining. For Live/Dead staining, the samples were incubated with
the Live/Dead cell-imaging solution according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and then observed using a fluorescent microscope (Eclipse
80i microscope, Nikon, Japan).

4.8 Statistical
Analysis
The statistical
analyses between different groups were calculated by the Student–Keuls
Multiple Comparisons Test (Instat 3.0, GraphPad Software, USA). A
probability of p ≤ 0.05 was considered a significant
difference.
