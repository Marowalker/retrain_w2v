Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a treatment in which photoactive
compounds delivered to cancerous tissues are excited with light and
then transfer the absorbed energy to adjacent tissue oxygen molecules
to generate toxic singlet oxygen (1O2). As 1O2 is produced only where light and photosensitizers
(PSs) are combined, PDT holds promise as a minimally invasive, highly
selective treatment for certain cancers. The practical application
of PDT requires easily synthesized, water-soluble PSs that have low
dark toxicities, high 1O2 quantum yields, and
efficient absorption of 650–850 nm near-infrared (NIR) light,
which deeply penetrates tissue. We recently developed a linear tetrapyrrole
metal complex, Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750, that meets most
of these criteria. This complex is remarkably effective as a PS for
PDT against triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells but, critically,
it does not absorb NIR light, which is necessary to treat deeper tumors.
To enable NIR activation, we synthesized a new derivative, Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH, which bears a thiol functionality that facilitates
conjugation to NIR-absorbing gold nanoshells (NSs). Upon excitation
with pulsed 800 nm light, NSs emit two-photon-induced photoluminescence
spanning 500–700 nm, which can sensitize the attached PSs to
initiate PDT. Additionally, NSs produce heat upon 800 nm irradiation,
endowing the NS–PS conjugates with an auxiliary photothermal
therapeutic (PTT) capability. Here, we demonstrate that NS–PS
conjugates are potent mediators of NIR-activated tandem PDT/PTT against
TNBC cells in vitro. We show that Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH retains the photophysical properties of the parent Pd[DMBil1]
complex, and that NS–PS generate 1O2 under
pulsed 800 nm irradiation, confirming activation of the PSs by photoluminescence
emitted from NSs. TNBC cells readily internalize NS PS conjugates,
which generate reactive oxygen species in the cells upon pulsed NIR
irradiation to damage DNA and induce apoptosis. Together, these findings
demonstrate that exploiting photoluminescent NSs as carriers of efficient
Pd[DMBil1] PSs is an effective strategy to enable NIR light-activated
tandem PDT/PTT.

Introduction
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an attractive
treatment for certain
cancers and offers a number of advantages over more conventional treatment
modalities. During PDT, a light-absorbing compound is applied directly
to the area requiring treatment or administered systemically via injection
into the bloodstream and allowed time to accumulate in the tumor prior
to irradiation. Provided that the PDT agent supports a triplet photochemistry,
light activation initiates energy transfer from the photosensitizer
(PS) to nearby molecular oxygen, forming excited singlet oxygen (1O2) in situ, which induces cellular damage. The
effects of 1O2 are constrained within an approximately
100 nm radius of the source,1 resulting
in highly localized cell death.2,3 Aside from the potential
to confine the effects of treatment to targeted tissues through careful
control of the illuminated area and/or preferential accumulation of
the PS in the tumor,4−8 PDT is also less invasive and gives better cosmetic outcomes than
surgical excision9 and it does not cause
the debilitating side effects encountered with radiotherapy or chemotherapy.10 Additionally, PDT can stimulate antitumor immunity
in contrast to the immunosuppressant nature of many other treatment
modalities.11,12

Despite its many potential
advantages, PDT has yet to be adopted
into the arsenal of commonly used cancer treatments because the development
of a single PS endowed with optimal photophysical and pharmacological
characteristics has remained elusive. The group of compounds that
have been investigated for use in PDT is dominated by macrocyclic
tetrapyrroles belonging to the porphyrinoid family,13−16 but has been expanding to include
additional classes of molecules.17−19 These compounds generate 1O2 effectively, but possess varying unfavorable
attributes such as challenging or low-yielding syntheses, a tendency
to aggregate or precipitate in biorelevant, aqueous-based solutions,
high inherent cellular dark toxicity, or poor absorption in the near
infrared (NIR) spectral regions (650–850 nm) that are best
suited to deeply penetrate biological tissues. Consequently, an active
area of research centers on development of improved PSs for use in
PDT. In support of this effort, we have introduced a family of stable
and synthetically accessible linear tetrapyrrole metal complexes known
as biladienes. These complexes absorb across a broad range of visible
wavelengths and generate 1O2 with quantum yields
that range from <0.2% to 80%, depending on the metal ion coordinated
within the biladiene core.20,21 Recently, we reported
a water-soluble derivative of the most promising complex, Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750, and demonstrated its ability to act as a highly effective
PS for PDT of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells with extremely
low toxicity in the dark and a remarkably high phototoxicity index
(PI; ratio of LD50/ED50) of ∼5300 under
excitation with λ > 500 nm light.22 Excitingly, the PI of this PS was ∼200 and ∼3000 times
higher than those of hematoporphyrin dihydrochloride and isohematoporphoyrin,
two commonly utilized photosensitizers. Despite these advances, Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750 only absorbs at wavelengths shorter than 600 nm, undercutting
its potential as a viable PDT agent for treatment of most solid tumors
because of limited tissue penetration attainable using those visible
wavelengths of light. To enable PDT of deeper-seated tumors, strategies
for NIR activation of Pd[DMBil1]-based photosensitizers must be developed.

One potential strategy to enable NIR activation of Pd[DMBil1]-based
PS for use in PDT would be to chemically modify the complex to red-shift
its absorption spectrum. The method commonly used to enhance absorption
at longer wavelengths involves extending the conjugated π system
of the chromophore. Such strategies generally require several additional
synthetic steps, and may fail to produce a bathochromic shift of the
magnitude needed to push the absorption envelope into the NIR. Additionally,
changing the structure and electronic conjugation of the PS can dramatically
impact the system’s photophysics. Reduction in the quantum
yield, lifetime, and energy of the 3PS* state formed upon
excitation can all decrease or shut down 1O2 production. An alternative strategy, which avoids the need for synthetic
modification of the PS core, is to use upconverting materials to transform
longer wavelength incident NIR light into shorter wavelengths that
the PDT agent can absorb. This strategy for NIR-activated PDT has
been explored for other visible light-activated 1O2 photosensitizers, which have been combined with upconverting
nanomaterials such as lanthanide-doped nanoparticles, quantum dots,
carbon nanomaterials, silica nanoparticles, polymer nanoparticles,
or gold nanorods.23−27 In this work, we have combined the promising Pd[DMBil1]-based PS
with NIR-activated silica core/gold shell nanoshells (NSs) to enable
NIR-activated PDT. This system offers several advantages over prior
conjugates, including the use of a designer PS that has 1O2 quantum yields much greater than commercial PSs, and
the use of NSs that are already being evaluated in clinical trials.28 The combination of these two entities enables
effective treatment to be achieved at much lower doses of the nanoconjugates
and light than possible with previously reported systems.

NSs
with diameters of ∼150 nm absorb broadly in the visible
to NIR spectral region with λmax ≈ 800 nm.29,30 When irradiated with a femtosecond (fs)-pulsed 800 nm laser, NS
photoluminescence is λ = 500–700 nm, which overlaps with
the absorption spectrum of the Pd[DMBil1] chromophore.21 NSs have a significant two-photon absorption
cross section comparable to values reported for gold nanorods and
some quantum dots (∼2000 GM).31,32 In addition
to upconverted emission, NSs also generate heat under NIR irradiation.
As a sufficient increase in temperature induces cell death, NSs and
other gold nanomaterials have received substantial attention for their
ability to mediate photothermal therapy (PTT) in solid tumors.33−37 Accordingly, we anticipated that irradiation with 800 nm light would
cause gold NS–Pd[DMBil1] photosensitizer conjugates (NS–PS)
to generate 1O2 to enable NIR-activated PDT
in complement with generation of heat to enable tandem PDT/PTT (Scheme 1). The oxygen-independent
nature of PTT permits light-induced cellular toxicity to be initiated
in tissues that may be too hypoxic for effective PDT,38 allowing for improved therapeutic effects deep within solid
tumors where oxygen levels tend to be low. Moreover, as increased
intratumoral blood flow has been observed during PTT, the tandem strategy
outlined above has the potential to enhance the PDT effect in solid/hypoxic
tumors by boosting cellular oxygen levels.39 The possible benefits of combining these two therapies have inspired
increasing research into dual PDT/PTT approaches,40−42 and multimodal
phototherapies that can be activated by a single wavelength of light
are especially attractive.

Scheme 1 Structure of NS–PS Conjugates and
Mechanism of NIR Light-Activated
Tandem PDT/PTT
In response to 800
nm pulsed
light, NSs emit photoluminescence that can activate PSs tethered to
their surface via a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chain, to trigger
PDT. Simultaneously, the NSs can produce heat to enable PTT.

In this work, the synthetic strategy developed previously
for Pd[DMBil1]–PEG75022 was adapted by replacing the
methoxy-terminated 750 Da PEG with a longer thiol-terminated 5000
Da PEG to neatly obtain the biladiene complex Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH that can be readily conjugated to NSs. The photophysical
properties of this new compound remain largely unchanged compared
to those of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750, and the thiol functionality
facilitates attachment to the gold surfaces of the NSs. The NS–PS
conjugates continue to produce 1O2 under 550
nm irradiation and heat under 800 nm irradiation, indicating that
neither the photodynamic capability of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH nor the photothermal capability of the NSs are lost after
linking the two components together. Additionally, NS–PS show
a clear ability to make 1O2 upon irradiation
with 800 nm light, which confirms that the Pd[DMBil1] can be activated
by the photoluminescence emitted from the NSs. Studies with MDA-MB-231
TNBC cells reveal that the NS–PS conjugates are well tolerated
in the dark, but efficiently mediate apoptotic cell death under pulsed
800 nm light. Furthermore, TNBC cells incubated with NS–PS
show enhanced levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage
following light treatment. Overall, this work demonstrates that linking
photoluminescent gold NSs to 1O2 photosensitizers
that absorb light in the visible region of the spectrum is an effective
strategy to enable NIR-activated tandem PDT/PTT. As shown here, a
single wavelength of tissue-penetrating NIR light can be utilized
to activate NSs, resulting in the emission of photoluminescence that
yields luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET)-based sensitization
of the PS for PDT, as well as simultaneous production of heat for
complimentary PTT. As NSs have already entered clinical trials with
promising results,28 and Pd[DMBil]-based
PSs have a substantially higher phototoxicity index than other agents
used for PDT, the NS–PS conjugates reported here are poised
to substantially advance the field of photoactivated cancer therapy.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of and 1O2 Sensitization by
Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH
Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH was synthesized as shown in Scheme 2 using the same synthetic strategy
employed previously for Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750.22 Briefly, the biladiene core was prepared in
four steps using methodology previously developed for the synthesis
of biladienes21 and related tetrapyrroles
containing sp3-hybridized mesocarbons.43−45 Installation
of the HS–PEG5000–NH2 chain was
facilitated by the presence of the biladiene’s ancillary 5-
and 15-pentafluorophenyl rings, which can be substituted with mercaptoacetic
acid via nucleophilic aromatic substitution of the para-fluorine substituents46 to generate Pd[DMBil1]–SCH2CO2H. PEGylation of the carboxylic acid-appended biladiene
was achieved using standard amide coupling chemistry. Treatment of
Pd[DMBil]–SCH2CO2H with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and 1-ethyl-3-(3′-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
hydrochloride (EDC) to form the corresponding NHS mercaptoacetate
intermediate was followed by reaction with triethylamine and 5 kDa
HS–PEG5000–NH2 chain to deliver
the desired Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH derivative.
The length of the HS–PEG5000–NH2 chain (5 kDa) was chosen to ensure stability and biocompatibility
of the final NS–PS conjugate (Scheme 1) upon tethering of the Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH to NSs.29,47−49 Synthetic procedures and characterization data for Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH are detailed in the Experimental
Methods and Supporting Information. The structure of this compound was verified by a combination of 1H, 13C, and 19F NMR spectroscopy (Figures S1–S3).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH
The steady-state photophysical properties of
Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH are consistent with
those previously observed
for Pd[DMBil1]21 and Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750.22 When dissolved in methanol,
Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH displays absorption
maxima at 402 and 481 nm, with a shoulder around 543 nm. These features
also appear in the absorption profiles of Pd[DMBil1] and Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750 at nearly identical wavelengths as shown in Figure 1a and Table 1. The maximum extinction coefficient of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH (35 300 M–1 cm–1) is enhanced slightly compared to that of Pd[DMBil1]
(29 200 M–1 cm–1), and
is close to the maximum extinction coefficient observed for Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750 (34 600 M–1 cm–1). Functionalization with the longer thiol-terminated PEG chain appears
to cause a modest increase in the extinction coefficient of the longer
wavelength shoulder from the values of 7200 and 7500 M–1 cm–1 observed for Pd[DMBil1] and Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750, respectively, to 8700 M–1 cm–1 for Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH. Upon excitation
at λex = 460 nm, a nitrogen-saturated methanol solution
of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH produces two broad
emission features spanning the ranges of λem = 500–700
nm and λem = 725–850 nm, as shown in Figure 1b. Pd[DMBil1] and
Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750 display two similar emission features
in nitrogen-saturated methanol under the same conditions, and the
second feature has been attributed to phosphorescence because of its
large Stoke’s shift and complete disappearance upon exposure
to air.21,22 As shown in Figure 1b, the second feature of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH is also quenched under air, confirming its identity
consistent with the long wavelength band corresponding to phosphorescence.
These results demonstrate that the thiol-terminated PEG substituent
does not significantly attenuate intersystem crossing or the triplet
photochemical properties of the Pd[DMBil1] core to the triplet excited
state. Table 1 compiles
the emission characteristics of Pd[DMBil1], Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750, and Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH. The
fluorescence quantum yield of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH (3.1 × 10–4) is only marginally
higher than Φfl of Pd[DMBil1] (1.3 × 10–4) and Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750 (1.4 ×
10–4). Additionally, the phosphorescence signal
measured for Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH has a
maximum at 755 nm, which is essentially identical to the phosphorescence
maxima of Pd[DMBil1] (753 nm) and Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750 (756 nm). Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH has a phosphorescence
quantum yield of 6.1 × 10–5, which is slightly
lower than Φphos of Pd[DMBil1] (1.3 × 10–4), but close in value to that measured for Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750 (7.8 × 10–5). Overall, the longer
5 kDa PEG chain and presence of a thiol functional group do not significantly
perturb the electronic/photochemical properties of the palladium biladiene
photosensitizer.

The steady-state photophysical properties of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH were also examined in ultrapure water (Table 1 and Figure S4), to gain insight into how this new derivative might
behave under biocompatible aqueous environments. The most prominent
absorption feature of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH
and the longer wavelength shoulder shifted bathochromically from 481
and 543 nm in methanol to 488 and 546 nm in water. Additionally, the
extinction coefficients of the two absorption maxima of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH in water (13 700 and 29 500 M–1 cm–1) were attenuated slightly
compared to their values in methanol (17 600 and 35 300
M–1 cm–1), whereas the intensity
of the longer wavelength shoulder increased from 8700 to 10 100
M–1 cm–1. Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH was found to obey the Beer–Lambert Law
in water (Figure S5), suggesting that it
is not prone to aggregation within the range of concentrations tested
(8.0–40.0 μM). For comparison, Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750 showed very similar absorption characteristics in ultrapure
water, but exhibited a slightly more pronounced red shift and enhancement
of the long wavelength shoulder (Figure S4 and Table 1). The
aqueous emission profiles of the two PEGylated derivatives were also
nearly identical. Figure S4 shows that
fluorescence (but not phosphorescence) was observed from Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH in nitrogen-saturated ultrapure water. Previously,
we noted that Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750 failed to phosphoresce
in pH 7.4 phosphate buffered saline (PBS) under a nitrogen atmosphere,
which was attributed to rapid deactivation of the triplet excited
state through energy transfer to a water overtone.22 The fluorescence features of both complexes are red-shifted
compared to their positions in methanol, and Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH has a fluorescence maximum at around 585 nm
in ultrapure water, whereas that of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750 occurs at about 580 nm in pH 7.4 PBS(Table 1). The Φfl of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH in ultrapure water was calculated to be 1.3
× 10–4, which is a slight decrease from the
value of 3.1 × 10–4 calculated in methanol.
The Φfl calculated previously for Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750 in PBS(2.0 × 10–4) was only marginally
higher.22 These results suggest that the
photophysical characteristics of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH in water are reminiscent of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750, and it may behave similarly as an effective 1O2 photosensitizer in aqueous environments.

To verify
that Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH retains
the ability of the parent tetrapyrrole to sensitize 1O2 efficiently, its ability to generate this ROSs was ascertained
in both methanol and ultrapure water. Using 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran
(DPBF) as a probe for 1O2 production50 and [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2 as a reference photosensitizer with ΦΔ = 0.81 in methanol,51 the 1O2 quantum yield of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH was determined to be 0.66 under irradiation with 500 nm
light (in methanol). This value is only slightly lower than the quantum
yield measured for the original Pd[DMBil1] photosensitizer (ΦΔ = 0.81), and is slightly higher than the quantum yield
found for Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750 in methanol (ΦΔ = 0.57), as summarized in Table 1. The ability of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH to photosensitize the formation of 1O2 was also determined in water using singlet oxygen sensor
green (SOSG) as a probe52 and methylene
blue as a reference photosensitizer (ΦΔ = 0.52).53,54 Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH exhibited an impressive
quantum yield of 0.48 upon excitation with 550 nm light. This value
is significantly higher than that measured for Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750 in ultrapure water (ΦΔ = 0.13),
and is comparable to the 1O2 quantum yields
of PSs that are used clinically as PDT agents.17 The results of these studies indicate that the 5 kDa thiol-terminated
PEG substituent retains the palladium biladiene’s ability to
efficiently photosensitize 1O2 production in
both polar protic and aqueous environments.

Characterization of NS–PS and NS–PEG
NSs composed of silica cores (∼120 nm) and thin gold shells
(∼15 nm) were synthesized according to previously published
methods.30 For our studies, we developed
two types of NS formulations: (1) NSs coated with Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH (NS–PS) and (2) NSs coated with only
mPEG5000–SH (NS–PEG). UV–vis spectrophotometry
revealed that the NS–PS had a peak plasmon resonance at 800
nm (Figure 2a), which
was tuned to be consistent with the wavelength of the pulsed laser
for optimal PTT and PDT effects. The photosensitizer peak is not noticeable
after conjugation as its concentration (ca. 0.2 μM) in the solution
of NSs at OD1 is below the limit of detection (Figure S5). However, a slight bathochromic-shift of NS–PS
over bare NSs is a positive sign of successful functionalization with
the Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH. The functionalization
was further confirmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS), which showed
an increased hydrodynamic diameter from bare NSs (151.9 ± 1.6
nm) to NS–PEG (172.6 ± 2.8 nm) and NS–PS (201.9
± 1.6 nm) (Figure 2b). Slight increases in zeta potential were observed among bare NSs
(−35.1 ± 0.7) to NS–PEG (−31.8 ± 0.7)
and NS–PS (−29.3 ± 0.2) (Figure 2b). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
indicated that the NS–PS had a highly monodisperse size distribution
(Figure 2c), as did
bare NSs and NS–PEG (Figure S6).
The photosensitizer loading on NSs was quantified using an established
standard curve (Figure S5) based on the
absorbance of the photosensitizer at 488 nm. The loading was determined
to be 39 600 ± 2260 per NS (Figure 2d). Notably, spectrophotometry analysis of
the NS–PS conjugates demonstrated that they were extremely
stable when stored in water. The extinction profile of the conjugates
was maintained up to 15 months (Figure S7), and no precipitation was visible to the eye.

NS–PS Generate 1O2 and Heat upon
Excitation with Pulsed NIR Light
We examined the ability
of NS–PS to generate 1O2 in water using
a SOSG assay (Figures 3, S8). In this assay, reaction of SOSG
with 1O2 produces a more emissive endoperoxide,51 enabling a qualitative comparison of the relative
amounts of 1O2 produced by different photoactive
agents. The changes in integrated emission intensity of SOSG over
time as NS–PEG, Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH,
the NS–PS conjugates, or a mixture of NS–PEG and Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750 in ultrapure water were irradiated are shown in Figure S8. Irradiation with 550 nm continuous
wave (CW) light via a LED lightbox overlaid with a yellow filter (Figures S8a and S9), which directly activates
the biladiene PS, drove the largest increase in SOSG emission intensity
in the presence of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH
or the mixture of NS–PEG and Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750. The change in SOSG emission intensity of these two solutions was
not significantly different, and this result is in agreement with
our previous observations that mixing NSs with photosensitizers without
physically connecting them does not compromise the PS′ ability
to generate 1O2 upon irradiation with visible
light.29 The solution of NS–PEG
alone and the ultrapure water control did not show any increase in
SOSG emission upon 550 nm CW irradiation, and therefore did not produce 1O2. Conversely, the SOSG emission intensity from
the solution of NS–PS conjugates did show a significant increase
compared to the control and NS–PEG solutions, but the enhancement
was much less pronounced than that observed for Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH alone or the mixture of NS–PEG and Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750. This result suggests that conjugating the biladiene PS
to the NS surface may slightly attenuate the 1O2 quantum yield, but the NS–PS conjugates can still function
as PDT agents using visible light as 1O2 production
was not eliminated completely.

induce visible photoluminescence as shown in Scheme 1, the NS–PS conjugates produced the
greatest enhancement in SOSG emission intensity (Figures 3a and S8b), consistent with 1O2 photosensitization
using NIR light. Solutions of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH do not absorb 800 nm light and, unsurprisingly, did not
induce an increase in SOSG emission intensity upon direct NIR excitation.
Based on these results, it is clear that the 1O2 produced by the NS–PS conjugates cannot be the result of
direct excitation of the biladiene PS. We note that gold nanoparticles
have been reported to produce 1O2,55 which may partially explain the increase in
SOSG emission intensity observed upon irradiation of the NS–PEG
with 800 nm pulsed laser light (Figures 3b and S8b). Additionally,
SOSG and the endoperoxide it forms following reaction with 1O2 can also photosensitize 1O2.51,56 Although SOSG (and the formed endoperoxide) do not absorb 800 nm
light, the absorption spectra of these fluorescein derivatives overlap
with the wavelengths of upconverted emission produced by the NSs,
which may contribute to the SOSG emission enhancement observed in
the presence of the NS–PEG.

Although there is some evidence
of 1O2 production
upon 800 nm irradiation of NS–PEG, the observed increase in
SOSG emission intensity produced by the NS–PS conjugates was
significantly higher (Figure 3c) at all sampling times, indicating that the 1O2 formed by the conjugates cannot simply be attributed
to the NSs or SOSG. Furthermore, the increase in SOSG emission intensity
observed for solutions of NS–PEG + Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750 (where the NSs and PSs are together in solution, but not
physically tethered) is essentially identical to that detected for
NS–PEG alone (Figure S8b). This
result implies that negligible amounts of PS are activated by photoluminescence
emitted from the NSs when they are not physically conjugated to one
another. This finding is not surprising given that LRET is extremely
sensitive to donor–acceptor distance. Proximity is required
for efficient energy transfer. Overall, these observations support
the conclusion that the 1O2 generated by the
NS–PS conjugates under 800 nm pulsed laser light is the result,
at least in part, of activation of the biladiene PS by the photoluminescence
emitted from the NSs upon NIR exposure. Based on these results, the
NS–PS conjugates have the capability of serving as PDT agents
using deeply penetrating NIR light.

In addition to producing
upconverted photoluminescence, NSs can
also generate heat upon NIR laser irradiation because of their surface
plasmon resonance and high photothermal conversion efficiency.57−59 To confirm that NS–PS retain the photothermal properties
of the underlying NSs, we measured the temperature of NS–PEG
and NS–PS suspended in water at concentrations of OD1, OD2,
or OD3 while exposed to 800 nm pulsed laser light (1 W/cm2). Thermal images were taken with an FLIR forward-looking infrared
E6 camera once per minute for the first 5 min of irradiation and then
once every 5 min for up to 20 min. We found that the temperature of
all NS–PS and NS–PEG solutions increased rapidly during
the first 5 min, then reached a plateau (Figure S10a). In contrast, no obvious temperature increase was observed
for water irradiated with the laser that did not contain NSs (Figure S10a, black line). We also evaluated the
photothermal profile of NS–PS after they were incubated in
complete cell culture media for 24 h. Similar to the studies performed
in water, the temperature increased rapidly during the first 5 min,
then climbed slowly for the next 5 min until reaching a plateau (Figure 3d). The overall temperature
increase for NS–PS in media was less than that for NS–PS
in water, which is expected due to the interaction of serum proteins
and nanoparticles. Finally, the photothermal stability of NS–PS
was also studied by irradiating NS–PS in a cyclic fashion,
which revealed that the photothermal conversion abilities of the NS–PS
conjugates are not compromised within four irradiation cycles (Figure S10b). Together, these results demonstrate
that NS–PS are capable of generating heat sufficiently, in
addition to generating 1O2 upon NIR irradiation,
making it an excellent candidate for dual PDT/PTT.

MDA-MB-231 TNBC Cells Internalize NS–PS Conjugates
Darkfield microscopy was used to examine the interaction between
NS–PS and MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells. In darkfield microscopy images,
NS–PS appear as reddish spots owing to the NS′ strong
light-scattering properties. The results reveal that NS–PS
(Figure 4, right, pink-red
spots) are bound to or internalized by MDA-MB-231 cells following
a 24 h incubation period. In contrast, cells that are not treated
with NS–PS appear blue, as a result of the intrinsic scattering
from intracellular structures (Figure 4, left). The ability of MDA-MB-231 cells to engage
NS–PS is important as the distance between photosensitizers
and genomic DNA is critical to the efficacy of PDT treatment. As the
half-life of 1O2 is short, the effects of photosensitizers
are felt only within an approximately 100 nm radius of the source.1 The NS–PS conjugates appear to be well
dispersed within the cells. This is an important observation, as the
aggregation of gold NSs can reduce their upconversion efficiency and
impair 1O2 sensitization and/or photothermal
conversion processes critical to PDT/PTT efficacy. Based on these
data, we further evaluated NS–PS as agents for combined PDT/PTT
of TNBC (vide infra).

Figure 4 Darkfield images show NS–PS interacting with MDA-MB-231
cells following a 24 h incubation period. Cells exposed to media only
(no treatment) exhibit an intrinsic blue scattering signal. NS–PS
(red) are visible against the blue cell background in samples treated
with NS–PS owing to their enhanced light-scattering properties.

NS–PS Produce ROS and Induce DNA Damage upon NIR Activation
To assess in vitro generation of ROS by NS–PS under NIR
irradiation, 6-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (carboxy-H2DCFDA) was used as a fluorogenic probe. As shown
in Figures 5a and S11, MDA-MB-231 cells incubated with NS–PS
or NS–PEG and carboxy-H2DCFDA but not exposed to light did
not exhibit green fluorescence indicative of ROS formation. Similarly,
cells that were irradiated with 800 nm pulsed laser light, in the
absence or presence of NS–PEG, did not show the green fluorescence
signal that is the hallmark of ROS production. By contrast, cells
incubated with NS–PS and then treated with λex > 500 nm light irradiation using a lightbox with a longpass filter
(Figure S9) to activate PDT, but not PTT,
showed a slight increase in green fluorescence, signaling modest production
of ROS (Figure 5a).
This weak PDT effect is likely due to the relatively low power density
of the LED lightbox and short irradiation time, which was set based
on the viability effect of PDT/PTT. Importantly, cells incubated with
NS–PS and then exposed to 800 nm pulsed light to induce both
PDT and PTT emitted brighter green fluorescence than all other control
groups, indicating efficient ROS generation under these conditions
(Figure 5a).

of PS via upconverted photoluminescence). Samples exposed to the lightbox
or laser were irradiated for 5 min each. Blue indicates nuclei and

γ-H2AX expression in MDA-MB-231 cells that were untreated or

ROS are known to cause DNA damage.60,61 To investigate
the impact of PDT/PTT mediated by NS–PS on the extent of MDA-MB-231
cellular DNA damage, we probed the expression level of γ-H2AX,
which is a marker for DNA damage and genomic instability,62 by western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 5b, MDA-MB-231 cells
treated with NS–PS in the dark showed negligible γ-H2AX
expression, indicating that NS–PS alone do not induce DNA damage.
Cells treated with 800 nm pulsed light, but not incubated with NS–PS,
exhibited a slight increase in γ-H2AX expression, which is in
agreement with previous studies63,64 describing DNA damage
effects of different laser types, as a function of wavelengths and
power. In comparison, cells treated with NS–PS and then exposed
to λ > 500 nm light to induce PDT exhibited an increased
level
of γ-H2AX, indicating DNA damage because of successful generation
of 1O2. Importantly, the highest expression
of γ-H2AX was observed in cells treated with NS–PS and
pulsed 800 nm irradiation to induce dual PDT/PTT, which is consistent
with the ROS levels determined by the SOSG assay (Figure 3a,c) and carboxy-H2DCFDA imaging
(Figure 5a) experiments.

PDT/PTT Mediated by NS–PS Reduces TNBC Cell Metabolic
Activity and Induces Apoptosis
To benchmark the efficacy
of NS–PS as photochemotherapeutic agents of cancer via tandem
PDT/PTT, we examined the impact of phototreatment on cellular metabolic
activity. MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells were treated with 8 × 109 NS–PS/mL for 24 h, then irradiated with either the
800 nm laser at 1 W/cm2 for 5 min/well to activate PDT
and PTT or with λ > 500 nm light using the LED lightbox for
5 or 10 min/well to activate PDT only. Control groups were included
that were not incubated with NS–PS but were exposed to the
NIR or visible light treatments. After the light treatments, the TNBC
cells were incubated for 24 h and cellular metabolic activity was
assessed using an Alamar Blue assay. Cells treated with laser irradiation
only (Figure S12) or with NS–PS
without laser irradiation showed minimal losses in metabolic activity,
demonstrating that neither the pulsed laser conditions nor the concentration
of NS–PS utilized are inherently harmful to TNBC cells (Figure 6). Cells incubated
with NS–PS and irradiated using a lightbox (λ > 500
nm)
to induce PDT via direct activation of the biladiene PS on conjugates’
surface experienced ∼5% loss in metabolic activity following
5 min irradiation and ∼10% loss in metabolic activity following
10 min irradiation (Figures 6 and S13). By comparison, cells
incubated with NS–PS and irradiated with the 800 nm laser for
5 min to induce dual PDT/PTT experienced a nearly 80% reduction in
metabolic activity, which is significantly lower than that of the
cells that received PDT alone. These results demonstrate that dual
PDT/PTT can be achieved with NS–PS following excitation with
a single wavelength NIR laser, and that the therapeutic effect is
improved versus PDT alone.

or treated with
only the 800 nm pulsed laser, only NS–PS, NS–PS + lightbox

of laser or lightbox exposure was 5 min for all samples. *p < 0.001 compared to cells treated with laser only,
NS–PS only, NS–PS + lightbox, or no treatment by one-way
ANOVA with post hoc Tukey.

After showing that PDT/PTT mediated by NS–PS
can potently
reduce cellular metabolic activity, we next evaluated the mechanism
by which cell death proceeds. Understanding the mechanism of cell
death is important as apoptosis versus necrosis can produce very different
responses in the tumor microenvironment, which ultimately dictate
whether phototreatment is successful.65 When necrosis occurs, cells lose their plasma membrane integrity,
which causes intracellular contents including damage-associated molecular
patterns (DAMPs) to be released into the extracellular milieu and
trigger local inflammatory and immunogenic responses. These responses
can be detrimental to treatment success unless the primary therapy
is combined with a form of immunotherapy that can take advantage of
the ability of DAMPs and released tumor-associated antigens to stimulate
an immune response. Conversely, during apoptosis, cell membrane integrity
is maintained resulting in an anti-inflammatory mechanism of cell
death that may be more appealing when PDT/PTT is applied as a standalone
treatment.29,65

To clarify the mechanism
of cell death induced by NS–PS
under the dosage and laser irradiation conditions employed in this
work, we performed AnnexinV-FITC (AnnV-FITC) and PI staining followed
by flow cytometry after TNBC cells were treated as described in the Experimental Methods. AnnV binds phosphatidylserine
on apoptotic cells, whereas PI is excluded from cells with an intact
membrane. Accordingly, cells that die by different pathways appear
in distinct regions of flow cytometry density quadrant plots. Representative
data are shown in Figure 7a, where live cells are AnnV–/PI– (bottom left
quadrant), early apoptotic cells are AnnV+/PI– (bottom right
quadrant), late apoptotic cells are AnnV+/PI+ (top right quadrant),
and necrotic cells are AnnV–/PI+ (top left quadrant). Analysis
of these data across experiments reveals that TNBC cells incubated
with NS–PS but not exposed to light are equally viable as compared
to cells that received no treatment (Figure 7a,b), supporting the NS–PS biocompatibility
studies described above (Figure 6). Cells that underwent laser irradiation alone were
∼15% apoptotic, compared to ∼5% in control cells (Figure 7a,b). This slight
increase may be due to the minor DNA damage that was observed following
NIR laser irradiation (Figure 5b). Interestingly, this slight apoptotic profile change did
not influence the cells’ metabolic activity (Figure 6). By comparison, cells incubated
with NS–PS that were subjected to lightbox irradiation (i.e.,
cells that received PDT) demonstrated ∼15% apoptosis (Figure 7b) and also experienced
a modest decrease in metabolic activity (Figure 6). This disparity illustrates the complexity
of cell homeostasis under external insults. Further studies will be
needed to determine the specific repair/survival mechanisms governing
the stress response and the relationship between apoptosis and metabolic
activity under different treatment conditions.

Figure 7 Flow cytometry analysis
of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with laser
only, NS–PS only, NS–PS + lightbox (PDT), or NS–PS
+ laser (PDT/PTT) following 5 min of lightbox/laser exposure. Untreated
cells were also examined as a control group. (a) Representative flow

right quadrants = late apoptotic cells, top left quadrant = necrotic

cells following each treatment. ***p < 0.001 by
one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey.

Notably, cells treated with NS–PS in combination
with NIR
light (i.e., tandem PDT/PTT) demonstrate a nearly 40% apoptotic population,
which is significantly higher than observed in all other treatment
groups (Figure 7b).
The pronounced increase in apoptotic cell population observed upon
NIR activation of NS–PS is another indication that the nanoshell–biladiene
conjugates can mediate dual PDT/PTT. Importantly, no increase of necrotic
cell population was observed across all treatment groups (Figure 7c). These results
are encouraging given that apoptosis is the preferred mechanism of
cell death for photoresponsive therapies. Taken together, the results
of the metabolic activity and AnnV/PI assays indicate that NS–PS
can feasibly mediate dual PDT/PTT upon excitation with NIR light to
trigger proapoptotic cell death. Further, these assays indicate that
NIR activation of NS–PS is more effective than use of visible
light under the conditions evaluated here.

Conclusions and Future Directions
PDT makes use of
light, a photoresponsive agent, and molecular
oxygen to kill cells in a minimally invasive, spatially controlled
manner. Although this type of treatment offers advantages over traditional
treatment strategies, the challenge of developing a photosensitizer
with optimal photophysical and pharmacological properties has been
an obstacle to widespread clinical adoption of PDT. Whereas 650–850
nm light is ideal for photoactivated therapies because it can more
deeply penetrate biological tissues than other wavelengths of light,
many photosensitizers absorb at shorter visible wavelengths, thwarting
their effective use as phototherapeutic agents. Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750 is an example of a photosensitizer that exhibits many favorable
attributes such as straightforward synthesis and purification, excellent
water solubility and biocompatibility, high 1O2 quantum yield, very low dark toxicity to cells, and an impressively
high phototoxicity index. Nonetheless, this biladiene scaffold is
impractical as a mediator of PDT in solid tumors because it does not
absorb within the therapeutic NIR window (λ = 650–850
nm). In this study, we sought to address this shortcoming by conjugating
Pd[DMBil1]-based PSs to photoluminescent NSs that efficiently absorb
800 nm light and emit shorter wavelengths of light that can activate
the attached biladienes.

To enable the conjugation, a new biladiene
derivative (Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH) was prepared
via installation of a longer thiol-terminated
PEG-chain in place of the shorter methoxy-terminated water-solubilizing
group employed in Pd[DMBil1]–PEG750. This strategy
takes advantage of the modular nature of biladiene syntheses, and
ensured that the desirable photophysical and triplet photochemical
properties of the Pd[DMBil1] PS were unperturbed (Figure 1, Table 1). Preparation of the NS–PS conjugates
was accomplished by simple incubation of NSs with the Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH derivative.

The NS–PS conjugates
can sensitize production of 1O2 upon irradiation
with 550 nm light via direct excitation
of the biladiene PS, or under 800 nm pulsed laser light exposure where
the NSs are activated and emit upconverted photoluminescence that
is reabsorbed by the attached PS (Figure 3). The NS–PS conjugates also retain
the ability to generate heat (Figure 3), which is characteristic of the gold NSs and endows
the conjugates with auxiliary PTT properties. The NS–PS were
found to be essentially nontoxic to MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells in the dark
at the optical densities tested (Figures 5–7), but caused
ROS production, DNA damage, loss of metabolic activity, and, ultimately,
apoptotic death in TNBC cells subjected to NIR laser treatment (Figures 5–7). In total, this work demonstrates that conjugating
visible light-absorbing Pd[DMBil1] photosensitizers to upconverting
nanoparticles is an effective way to use this compound for NIR-activated
PDT without making major synthetic modifications to its structure.
Additionally, the use of upconverting materials, such as NSs, that
also produce heat upon NIR irradiation yields constructs capable of
mediating both PDT and PTT in response to excitation with a single
wavelength of light. The potential benefits of multimodal therapy,
including the possibility of achieving improved therapeutic outcomes
with lower treatment doses, may warrant continued investigations into
hybrid photosensitizer/nanoshell constructs or alternative materials
with analogous properties.

Although this study demonstrates
that the NS–PS conjugates
may potentially serve as powerful agents for cancer treatment, they
will also require further optimization. For example, future studies
could vary the length of the thiol-terminated PEG functionality to
examine the relationship between the distance of the PS from the NS
surface and the efficiency of LRET-based PS activation. Additionally,
the NS surfaces could be passivated with methoxy–PEG–thiols
that have larger average molecular weights than the PEG substituent
linking the Pd[DMBil1] PS to the NSs to help shield the hydrophobic
tetrapyrrole chromophores from the surrounding aqueous environment
and reduce NS–PS aggregation that may diminish the stability
and 1O2 production of the conjugates. Exploring
various ratios of methoxy–PEG–thiol to PS–PEG–thiol
may also permit studies of the relationship between PS loading and 1O2 production. Ongoing research in our groups is
focused on developing new NS–PS conjugates for improved NIR-activated
dual PDT and PTT. As this research progresses, we will perform additional
studies to understand the intracellular trafficking of NS–PS
and to evaluate their performance in the in vivo setting.

In
conclusion, we have developed NS/Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000 conjugates as new tools to enable NIR-activated tandem PDT and PTT.
These materials are a substantial addition to the growing portfolio
of nanotechnologies developed for photoactivated cancer therapy. One
key advantage of this system over prior technologies created for PDT
(or tandem PDT/PTT) is that it incorporates designer biladiene-based
PSs that are much more efficient and potent than commercially available
PSs that exhibit modest 1O2 quantum yields.
This allows the NS–PS conjugates to elicit successful PDT/PTT
with much lower nanoparticle/photosensitizer doses than prior systems,
with less intense irradiation conditions and with reduced irradiation
times.66−68 A second distinguishing feature of our system is
that it exploits two-photon-induced photoluminescence emitted from
the NSs to excite the PS, a mechanism that is distinct from that of
traditional upconverting nanoparticles that have been tethered to
PSs. Finally, in this study, we provide an in-depth examination of
the mechanism of cell death induced by tandem PDT/PTT with NS–PS
conjugates. We show that NS–PS conjugates produce ROS in cells
upon NIR irradiation to induce DNA damage and trigger apoptosis. This
is a desirable mechanism of cell death, as apoptosis can promote a
beneficial immune response that may enhance tumor response to therapy.
Thus, NS–PS conjugates are not only potent mediators of NIR-activated
PDT/PTT, but they also initiate cell death through a preferred biological
pathway. Given the many advantages of this system, with further development,
it will offer a robust platform for NIR-activated tandem PDT/PTT of
cancer.

Experimental Methods
General Materials and Methods
Air-sensitive reactions
were carried out on a Schlenk line using flasks fitted with Suba-Seal
rubber septa and solvents that were dried via passage through activated
alumina.69 Solvents used were of reagent
grade or better. Chemicals were purchased from Strem, VWR, Sigma-Aldrich,
Fisher, Matrix Scientific, Acros, Decon Laboratories, Inc., Cambridge
Isotopes Laboratories, or Alfa Aesar. Column chromatography was carried
out with 40–63 μm silica gel purchased from SiliCycle
and converted to C2–silica following a published
procedure.22,70 Thin-layer chromatography was
carried out with precoated glass plates from SiliCycle and visualized
with UV light. Pd[DMBil1]–SCH2CO2H was
synthesized following published procedures.20−22,45,71 Ultrapure water (MQ
water) was obtained from a Milli-Q Century Academic water purification
system from Millipore.

Synthesis of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH
Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH (palladium 10,10-dimethyl-5-[para(N-(mercaptoethylpolyethyleneglycol)mercaptoacetamide)tetrafluorophenyl]-15-(pentafluorophenyl)biladiene)
was synthesized using the carbo-diimide coupling strategy we have
previously used to make other PEGylated derivatives of this photosensitizer.22 A Schlenk flask was charged with Pd[DMBil1]–SCH2CO2H (38 mg, 45 μmol), NHS (11 mg, 96 μmol),
and EDC (18 mg, 94 μmol) and placed under vacuum for 1 h. Dry
CH2Cl2 (4 mL) was added and the reaction was
stirred for 20 h at room temperature under N2. The crude
reaction mixture was diluted with additional CH2Cl2, washed four times with deionized water and once with brine,
and dried over Na2SO4. The solvent was removed
under reduced pressure and thiol–PEG5000–amine
(203 mg, 40 μmol) was added to the flask containing the biladiene–NHS
ester. The flask was placed under vacuum for 45 min, and then dry
CH2Cl2 (5 mL) and triethylamine (52 μL,
373 μmol) were added. The reaction was stirred for 15 h at room
temperature under N2, following which, the solvent was
removed by rotary evaporation. The resulting crude product was redissolved
in CH2Cl2, washed four times with deionized
water and once with brine, and then dried over Na2SO4. The product was further purified by column chromatography
on C2–silica by eluting in sequence with 1:1 hexane/CH2Cl2, 1:2 hexane/CH2Cl2, pure
CH2Cl2 and 3% methanol in CH2Cl2 to remove several impurities. The product was recovered from
the C2–silica column using 5–10% methanol
in CH2Cl2 as the mobile phase and was obtained
as a red, waxy solid (167 mg, 63% yield). 1H NMR (600 MHz,

Characterization of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH
1H NMR, 13C NMR, and 19F NMR spectra
(Figures S1–S3) were measured at
25 °C on a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer with a 5 mm Bruker SMART
probe. Proton spectra are referenced to the residual proton resonance
of the deuterated solvent (CDCl3 = δ 7.26) and carbon
spectra are referenced to the carbon resonances of the deuterated
solvent (CDCl3 = δ 77.16).72 Fluorine spectra are referenced to an external trifluoroacetic acid
standard (TFA = δ −76.55 in CD3CN).73 Chemical shifts are reported in parts-per-million
using standard δ notation.

Analysis of UV–Visible Absorption of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH
UV–visible absorbance spectra
of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH were measured with
a StellarNet Silver-NoVA CCD array UV–vis spectrometer. Samples
were prepared in quartz cuvettes (6I) of 1.0 cm pathlength manufactured
by Starna Cells, Inc. Room-temperature absorption spectra were collected
from 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 40 μM solutions of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH in methanol or ultrapure water.

Measurement of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–PEG5000–SH Emission Spectra
Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH emission spectra were collected on an automated
Photon Technology International (PTI) QuantaMaster 40 fluorometer
equipped with an LPS-220B lamp power supply, a 75 W Xenon arc lamp,
and a Hamamatsu R2658 photomultiplier tube. A 25 μM solution
of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH in methanol was
prepared under a nitrogen atmosphere in a 1 cm pathlength quartz cuvette
with a screw cap closure manufactured by Firefly Scientific. An air-saturated
solution of [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2 in acetonitrile
was prepared such that its absorptivity at λ = 460 nm closely
matched that of the 25 μM solution of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH at 460 nm, and was used as an emission standard
(Φref = 0.018 under air).74 The sample and standard were excited at λex = 460
nm, and emission was monitored from 480–900 nm using a step
size of 1 nm and an integration time of 0.25 s. The emission spectrum
of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH was re-measured
after exposure to air. All reported spectra are the average of five
individual acquisitions. Emission quantum yields were calculated using
the following expression  where Φs and Φref are the emission quantum yields of the sample and reference,
respectively, Is and Iref are the integrated emission intensities of the sample
and reference, respectively, As and Aref are the absorbances of the sample and reference
at λex = 460 nm, and ηs and ηref are the refractive indices of the solvents in which the
sample and reference were dissolved (methanol and acetonitrile, respectively).

Examination of Singlet Oxygen Sensitization by Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH and NS–PS Conjugates
The following
procedures were used to determine 1O2 production
capabilities of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH. Data
were collected with an automated PTI QuantaMaster 40 fluorometer equipped
with an LPS-220 lamp power supply, a 150 W xenon arc lamp, and a PTI
810 Photomultiplier Detection System with an R1527 photomultiplier
tube. All 1O2 experiments were conducted in
1.0 cm pathlength quartz cuvettes (6I) manufactured by Starna Cells,
Inc. 1O2 quantum yields were calculated using
the following equation  where Φs and Φref are the 1O2 quantum yields of the
sample and a reference photosensitizer, respectively, ms and mref represent the rates
of consumption of a 1O2 trapping probe in the
presence of the sample or reference photosensitizer, respectively,
and εs and εref are the extinction
coefficients of the sample and reference photosensitizer at the wavelength
of irradiation. All reported 1O2 quantum yields
are averages obtained from a minimum of three trials.

For singlet
oxygen studies in methanol, cuvettes were prepared to contain 2 mL
of 10.0 μM H2N–PEG5000–SH
in methanol, 10.0 μM Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH
in methanol, or 10.0 μM H2N–PEG5000–SH + 10.0 μM [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2 (used as a reference photosensitizer with Φref = 0.81),51 in methanol. Addition of H2N–PEG5000–SH to the methanol control
and [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2 standard solutions
was intended to correct for any environmental effects of the long
PEG chain attached to the Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH
photosensitizer. DPBF in methanol (20 μL of a 100 μM solution)
was added to each cuvette. 1O2 generation was
measured by tracking the attenuation of the DPBF fluorescence signal50 following 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 s of irradiation
with light from a 150 W halogen lamp (Nikon, Inc., model MKII) set
at half power and fitted with a 10 nm full width at half-maximum (fwhm)
bandpass filter centered at 500 nm (Thor Labs, FB500-10). To obtain
emission spectra of DPBF, samples were excited at λex = 405 nm and scanned from λem = 400–600
nm using a step size of 1 nm and an integration time of 0.25 s.

To correct for absorption of the DPBF emission by the photosensitizers,
calibration curves plotting the integrated emission intensity as a
function of the concentration of DPBF in the presence of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH or [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2 were generated, as has been reported previously.21 Emission spectra used in the calibration curves
were collected from 10.0 μM solutions of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH or the reference standard, which contained 0,
0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, or 1.50 μM concentrations of DPBF
and had not endured exposure to light. Linear regression analyses
of the data from each solution enabled conversion of the integrated
emission intensity values obtained during the 1O2 sensitization experiments into the corresponding concentrations
of unreacted DPBF. Linear regression analyses of plots of the concentration
of unreacted DPBF versus irradiation time for Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH and [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2 enabled ms and mref, respectively,
to be obtained as the slopes of the lines.

Similar methods were
employed for singlet oxygen sensitization
studies of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH in MQ water.
Cuvettes were prepared to contain 2 mL of 10.0 μM H2N–PEG5000–SH, 10.0 μM Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH, or 10.0 μM H2N–PEG5000–SH + 10.0 μM methylene blue (used as a reference
photosensitizer with Φref = 0.52).53,54 As indicated above, addition of H2N–PEG5000–SH to the solvent control and methylene blue standard solutions
was intended to correct for any environmental effects of the PEG chain
attached to the Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH photosensitizer.
A 20 μL aliquot of 250.0 μM SOSG in 5% methanol in MQ
water was then added to each cuvette in accordance with instructions
from the manufacturer. 1O2 production was monitored
by observing the enhancement in SOSG emission intensity52,56 following 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 s of irradiation with the 150 W
halogen lamp (Nikon, Inc., model MKII) used at full power and fitted
with a 10 nm fwhm bandpass filter centered at 550 nm (Thor Labs, FB550-10).
To obtain emission spectra of SOSG, samples were excited at λex = 480 nm and scanned from λem = 500–650
nm using a step size of 1 nm and an integration time of 0.25 s. Linear
regression analyses of plots of the integrated emission intensity
of SOSG versus irradiation time for Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH and methylene blue enabled ms and mref, respectively, to be obtained
as the slopes of the lines.

For singlet oxygen studies of the
NS–PS conjugates in MQ
water, cuvettes were prepared to contain 1.5 mL of MQ water, a solution
of NS–PEG with an optical density (OD) of 1, or an OD 1 solution
of NS–PS conjugates (procedures for synthesis of NS–PEG
and NS–PS are detailed in the following section; OD 1 corresponds
to ∼2.7 × 109 NS/mL). A 15 μL aliquot
of 250.0 μM SOSG in 5% methanol in MQ water was then added to
each cuvette. 1O2 production was monitored by
observing the enhancement in SOSG emission intensity, as mentioned
above, after 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min of irradiation with either the
150 W halogen lamp (Nikon, Inc., model MKII) used at full power and
fitted with a 10 nm fwhm bandpass filter centered at 550 nm (Thor
Labs, FB550-10) or a laser (Coherent Legend-Elite regenerative amplifier
seeded by a Coherent Mantis Ti:sapphire oscillator), which produced
a train of 35 fs pulses centered at 800 nm with a repetition rate
of 10 kHz and 100 μJ of energy. Emission spectra of SOSG were
obtained by exciting the samples at λex = 480 nm
and scanning from λem = 500–650 nm using a
step size of 2 nm and an integration time of 3 s. Plots of the integrated
emission intensity of SOSG as a function of irradiation time for the
various samples were compared qualitatively.

NS Synthesis and Functionalization
NSs were synthesized
according to published methods.30 Briefly,
3–4 nm diameter colloidal gold NPs formed by the Duff et al.
method75 were combined with 120 nm diameter
aminated silica NPs (Nanocomposix, San Diego, CA, USA) and reacted
for several days to form “seed.” The seed solution was
centrifuged (2000g, 20 min, twice) and the supernatant
containing unreacted gold colloid was removed. The purified seed,
which was diluted in water, was reacted with potassium carbonate containing
HAuCl4 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and formaldehyde
to create NSs, which were then purified by centrifugation (1500g, 5 min, twice). Next, NSs at OD 1.5 (corresponding to
4 × 109 NSs/mL) were combined at an initial ratio
of 7 × 105 ligands/NS with 5 μM Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH to form NS–PS or with 5 μM mPEG5000–SH (Laysan Bio, Arab, AL, USA) to form NS–PEG,
which serves as an experimental control. After reacting at room temperature
overnight, NS–PS or NS–PEG were purified by centrifugation
(1500g, 7 min, thrice) to remove unbound PS or PEG,
then stored in ultrapure water at 4 °C before use.

Characterization of NS Conjugates’ Optical and Structural
Properties
The extinction of bare NSs or functionalized NSs
suspended in water was determined by UV–visible spectrophotometry
(Cary60 spectrophotometer, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Bare NSs,
NS–PEG, or NS–PS (suspended in water to OD 1, corresponding
to 2.7 × 109 NSs/mL) were characterized by DLS and
zeta potential (Litesizer500, Anton Paar, Graz, Austria), and the
reported hydrodynamic diameter (using z-average mean)
and zeta potential are the mean from three sample measurements. Bare
NSs, NS–PEG, or NS–PS samples for SEM were diluted to
2.7 × 109 s/mL (OD 1) in 200 proof ethanol and dried
directly onto a polished carbon stub prior to imaging (S4700, Hitachi,
Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan).

Quantification of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH
Loading on NS–PS
To quantify the number of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH loaded per NS, we first prepared NS–PS
by incubating bare NSs (OD 5) with 10 μM Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH overnight at room temperature. A separate 10
μM Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH was prepared
as a total sample and kept the same way as the NS–PS sample.
After incubation, the NS–PS were centrifuged at 15 000g for 10 min to form a pellet and the unbound Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH was removed with the supernatant. The absorbances
of the PS-containing supernatant and the total PS sample were recorded
by UV–visible spectrophotometry (Cary60). To calculate the
concentration of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH in
each sample, a standard curve was established based on the OD at 490
nm (OD490) from a serial dilution of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH solutions in water up to 50 μM. The concentration
of NS-bound Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH was calculated
by subtraction of the concentration of free Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH in the supernatant from the concentration in
the total sample. The concentration of NS particles was calculated
based on Beer’s law with OD recorded from UV–visible
spectrophotometry. Final loading data were averaged based on data
collected from three individual samples.

Characterization of NS Conjugates’ Photothermal Properties
To analyze the ability of NS–PS to produce heat upon NIR
irradiation under different conditions, samples of NS–PS or
NS–PEG at different concentrations (OD 1, OD 2, or OD 3) were
dispersed in (i) water at room temperature or (ii) complete cell culture
media, with samples in cell culture media incubated in a 96-well plate
in a 37 °C humidified incubator for 24 h prior to testing. After
incubation, each sample was irradiated using an 800 nm femtosecond
(fs) pulsed laser at 1 W/cm2 and the temperature was recorded
using an FLIR E6 thermal camera (Wilsonville, OR, USA). A photothermal
cycling study of NS–PS was carried out by exposing NS–PS
(at a concentration of OD 3) loaded in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube to
laser irradiation at 1 W/cm2 for an on (5 min) and off
(15 min) cycle four times. The laser (coherent) utilized in the entire
study was equipped with a mode-locked Ti/Sapphire oscillator (Coherent
Mantis) and a regenerative amplifier (Coherent Legend Elite). The
output of the amplifier is a train of 35 fs pulses centered at 800
nm with a repetition rate of 10 kHz.

Cell Culture
MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (i.e., complete medium). Cells
were cultured in T75 cell culture flasks and incubated at 37 °C
in a 5% CO2 humidified environment. Cells were passed between
flasks or into sample plates by detaching the cells from the flasks
with TrypLE Express Enzyme, diluting the cells with complete medium,
and counting the cells with a hemocytometer before transferring to
a new flask or well plate.

Imaging the Cellular Interactions of NS–PS
To
analyze the interactions between MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells and NS–PS
by darkfield microscopy, cells were plated at 25 000 cells/well
in glass bottom eight-well plates with removable well chambers, and
incubated overnight. Then, 8 × 109 NS–PS/mL
diluted in complete cell culture medium was added to the cells for
24 h protected from light. The cells were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde
for 15 min and rinsed three times with 1× PBS. Well chambers
were removed and cells were imaged with a Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 Inverted
Fluorescent Microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) using a darkfield condenser
(to visualize scattering from NS–PS). Cells that did not receive
NS–PS were used as a control for background scattering signal.

Detection of ROS In Vitro
To confirm that NS–PS
can elicit PDT in vitro, an Image-iT LIVE Green ROSs Detection Kit
(Invitrogen) was used to detect the intracellular generation of ROSs
by NS–PS or control treatments following irradiation with light
or without exposure to light. MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in a Lab-Tek
8-well chambered coverglass at a density of 50 000 cells/well
and incubated overnight. Then, the cell culture medium was replaced
with fresh complete medium containing either 0 or 8 × 109 NS–PEG or NS–PS/mL, and the samples incubated
for 24 h protected from light. The samples were then irradiated at
1 W/cm2 with the 800 nm fs-pulsed laser for 5 min. Control
samples received either no irradiation or irradiation with λ
> 500 nm CW light (which directly activates Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH on the NSs) via a LED lightbox overlaid with
a yellow filter (Figure S9). After 24 h
of incubation following each treatment, the cells were stained with
fresh medium containing 25 μM carboxy-H2DCFDA (5-(and-6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate), which indicates the presence of ROS, for 30 min at 37
°C, protected from light. During the last 10 min of carboxy-H2DCFDA
incubation, 1 μM Hoechst 33342 was added to stain cell nuclei.
The cells were then washed with 1× PBS and imaged with a Zeiss
AxioObserver Z1 Inverted Fluorescent Microscope equipped with an apotome
using the EGFP (ROS) (excitation, 495 nm; emission, 525/50 nm) and
DAPI (nuclei) (excitation, 395 nm; emission, 445/50 nm) fluorescence
channels.

Western Blot Analysis for H2AX Expression
As PDT and
PTT can induce DNA damage, we performed western blotting to assess
the expression of H2AX, a DNA damage marker, in MDA-MB-231 cells exposed
to no treatment, NS–PS only, 800 nm light only, NS–PS
+ 800 nm fs pulsed light (which triggers dual PDT and PTT), or NS–PS
+ λ > 500 nm CW light (which triggers only PDT via direct
activation
of Pd[DMBil1]–PEG5000–SH on the NSs). After
the treatments were performed as described above, the MDA-MB-231 cells
were washed 1× with PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer (Amresco) supplemented
with Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Life Technologies) on ice.
Protein concentration was determined using a DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA) relative to a BSA standard. A 30 μg aliquot of
protein was loaded into each well of 4–12% Bis–Tris
gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and separated at 135
V for 60 min. The protein was then transferred to a 0.45 μm
nitrocellulose membrane for 10 min using the Pierce Power System (Thermo
Scientific). Membranes were blocked for 60 min in 5% nonfat milk in
tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST). Membranes were
probed with rabbit antihuman phospho-Histone H2AX (1:1000) or mouse
antihuman β-actin (1:2000) primary antibodies (Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA) at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation
with goat antirabbit (1:12 500) or antimouse (1:25 000)
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Kirkegaard &
Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) for 1 h at room temperature.
Protein bands were detected by chemiluminescence using VisiGlo Select
Chemiluminescent Substrate (Amresco, Solon, OH) and imaged on a ChemiDoc-It2
Imager (UVP, Upland, CA). The blot shown represents the average band
density across experiments.

Assessment of Cellular Metabolic Activity
MDA-MB-231
cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 50 000 cells/well,
treated with media containing 0 or 8 × 109 NS–PS/mL
for 24 h, and then subjected to no irradiation, or irradiation for
5 min/well using the 800 nm pulsed laser with a beam diameter of approximately
1 cm (to cover the entire well) and a power density of 1 W/cm2 or using the LED lightbox with a 500 nm longpass filter.
The plate was prewarmed and kept at 37 °C in a digital 2 block
heater (VWR) until the end of irradiation. After irradiation, the
cells were incubated for 24 h, then the media was removed and an Alamar
blue viability reagent (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA; diluted 1:10
in complete cell culture media) was added per manufacturer recommendations.
Sample fluorescence was measured on a Synergy H1M plate reader with
excitation and emission wavelengths of 560 and 590 nm, respectively.
To analyze the data, background (Alamar blue reagent without cells)
was subtracted from the fluorescence reading in each well.

Analysis of the Mechanism of Cell Death Induced by PDT/PTT with
NS–PS
MDA-MB-231 cells seeded in 96-well plates were
treated with media containing 0 or 8 × 109 NS–PS/mL
for 24 h and then subjected to no irradiation, or irradiation for
5 min/well using the 800 nm pulsed laser with a beam diameter approximately
1 cm and a power density of 1 W/cm2 or using the LED lightbox
with a 500 nm longpass filter. After treatment, samples were incubated
for 24 h, and then an AnnexinV–propidium iodide (PI) stain
(Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) was conducted via manufacturer
instructions to analyze cellular apoptosis versus necrosis. Briefly,
cells were lifted with trypsin, washed once with 1× binding buffer
(300g, 5 min), and resuspended in 50 μL of
binding buffer containing 1:500 AnnexinV-FITC and 1:2000 PI stains
for 10 min protected from light. The samples were then diluted with
150 μL 1× binding buffer and analyzed using an ACEA NovoCyte
2060 flow cytometer with the FITC (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 530/30
nm) and PerCP (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 675/30 nm) channels.
Data analysis was performed in NovoExpress software (ACEA Biosciences,
San Diego, CA, USA), and positive stained gates were based off of
unstained cells. Single stained controls were used for compensation.
Data shown are averaged amongst three independent experiments.

Statistical Analysis
All experiments were performed
in triplicate, and data represent means ± standard deviations
from three independent replicates unless otherwise indicated. Groups
with significant differences were identified using one-way ANOVA with
a post hoc Tukey test (or Student’s t-test
when only two groups were compared), and differences were considered
significant at p < 0.05. Statistical tests were
performed in Minitab software (Minitab, State College, PA), and flow
cytometry data were analyzed using NovoExpress software (ACEA Biosciences,
San Diego, CA).
