We disclose in this study a Ni6AlOx catalyst prepared by coprecipitation
for the reductive amination
of biomass-derived aldehydes and ketones in aqueous ammonia under
mild reaction conditions. The catalyst exhibited 99% yield toward
5-aminomethyl-2-furylmethanol in the reaction of 5-hydroxymethyl furfural
with ammonia at 100 °C for 6 h under 1 bar H2. The
catalyst was further extended to the reductive amination of a library
of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes and ketones with a yield in the
range 81–90% at optimized reaction conditions. Besides, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural
could react with a library of primary and secondary amines with yields
in the range 76–88%. The catalyst could be easily recycled
and reused without apparent loss of activity in four consecutive runs.

==== Body
Introduction
Furanic aldehydes (X-furfural
with X = H, CH2OH) are
important chemicals readily accessible from carbohydrates (hexoses
or pentoses) contained in lignocellulosic biomass.1 In particular, furfural (FF) is a versatile platform chemical
for the production of fuel additives, solvents, polymers, surfactants,
perfumes, and agrochemical ingredients.2 The current world production of FF is estimated at 280 kton/year
with the largest plant being based in the Dominican Republic with
a capacity of 35 kton/year.3 Likewise,
5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) has attracted great interest in recent
years with extensive research on its production and further transformation
as a platform chemical. Unlike FF, no industrial production of HMF
is available today. However, as key intermediate for FDCA production,
HMF is on a fast track for commercialization.4

Although the transformation of biomass into N-containing compounds
is highly desired for the synthesis of surfactants, pharmaceuticals,
and intermediates, only few examples have been reported on furanic
aldehydes.5 At industrial scale, FF can
be selectively converted into furfurylamine (FAM) by reductive amination
(RA) with NH3 over Ni and Co catalysts using dioxane or
alcohols as solvents.6 In the RA mechanism,
NH3 or an amine condense with a carbonyl compound to generate
an imine intermediate that is reduced in situ to form the amine product
and water.7,8 FAM can be further used for the synthesis
of pharmaceuticals such as antiseptic reagents, antihypertensives,
and diuretics (e.g., furosemide).9 Ionic
liquids were also synthesized by the RA of furanic aldehydes.10 At laboratory scale, Au, Pt, and Ir colloids
supported over sulfonic acid-functionalized silica were developed
for the RA of FF using aniline.11 Besides,
the electrochemical RA of HMF with ethanolamine using water as a hydrogen
source was also reported over a Ag electrode, achieving 92% yield.12

The amination of furanic aldehydes in
aqueous solution is drawing
more and more attention for applications in biorefineries. A key challenge
in these transformations is how to develop stable and robust non-noble
metal catalysts with high activity and selectivity toward the desired
amines. Kawanami and co-workers used commercial 5%Rh/Al2O3 to catalyze the RA of furanic aldehydes in 28% aqueous
solution of NH3 to achieve high selectivity at mild reaction
conditions without addition of solvents or additives.13 Ebitani and co-workers reported an active poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-capped Ru-supported hydroxyapatite
(Ru-PVP/HAP) catalyst for the RA of FF with aqueous NH3, achieving a yield up to 60% at optimized reaction conditions.14 Starting from diformylfuran (DFF), Girka et
al. prepared a new family of tetrahydrofuran-derived amines as biobased
surfactants.15 The authors developed a
two-step process comprising first the RA of DFF with aliphatic amines
in water using NaBH4 as reducing agent followed by the
reduction of the furan ring with Raney Ni. Hara and co-workers reported
a highly active and durable Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst
for the RA of carbonyl compounds containing reduction-sensitive functional
groups to primary amines.16,17 Ru/ZrO2 was
also developed for the RA of 5-methylfurfural with aqueous NH3, leading to 5-methylfurfurylamine with 61% yield. The coexistence
of Ru and RuO2 on the surface of Ru/ZrO2 provided
both strong Lewis acid and metal hydrogenation sites. The cooperation
between both sites led to an excellent performance for the production
of primary amines.18 Finally, CO-assisted
RA of HMF using a variety of amines in methanol/water (1:1 v/v) could
proceed fast over Au/TiO2.19

Ni is known as an active non-noble metal for the direct amination
of alcohols and the RA of aldehydes and ketones.20,21 Herein, a series of NiyAlOx catalysts were easily prepared by coprecipitation
of starting precursors and were further employed in the RA of furanic
aldehydes with aqueous NH3. More importantly, the Ni/Al
molar ratio could be easily tuned by adjusting the relative amount
of the starting precursors in the synthesis solution.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 plots the
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the different NiyAlOx catalysts prepared in this
study. The catalysts were prereduced ex situ before analysis. The
patterns suggest that finely crystallized metal Ni is formed on NiyAlOx, especially
at high Ni loading, as can be inferred from the characteristic Ni(111),
Ni(200), Ni(220), Ni(311), and Ni(222) reflections appearing at 44°,
53°, 77°, 93°, and 98°, respectively (Ni, JCPDS
card no: 04-0850, Fm3m cubic unit
cell). Unexpectedly, metal Ni is stable after air exposure, suggesting
potential encapsulation by alumina or passivation, especially at higher
Ni content. Additional reflections are also visible at 37°, 43°,
63°, 76°, and 79°, which can be assigned to NiO(111),
NiO(200), NiO(220), NiO(311), and NiO(222), respectively (NiO, JCPDS
card no: 47-1049, Fm3m cubic unit
cell). By decreasing the Ni/Al molar ratio, the reflections ascribed
to metal Ni become significantly weakened at the expense of the reflections
belonging to NiO. No reflections attributed to either alumina or the
spinel NiAl2O4 can be discerned, suggesting
the presence of amorphous aluminum oxides or hydroxides.

of NiyAlOx catalysts. From top to bottom: Ni10AlOx, Ni8AlOx, Ni6AlOx, Ni4AlOx, Ni2AlOx, and Ni1AlOx. The catalysts
were prereduced ex situ before analysis.

Figure 2 shows
representative
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs of Ni6AlOx after reduction at 450 °C for
2 h under H2 flow. Because the catalyst was prepared by
the coprecipitation method, it is difficult to distinguish Ni/NiO
nanoparticles on the catalyst surface. The average particle size of
the catalyst ranges from 10 to 30 nm. The magnified TEM micrographs
of Ni6AlOx reveal the presence
of highly crystalline Ni/NiO nanoparticles.

Figure 2 TEM micrographs of Ni6AlOx at different magnification
levels.

The surface composition of the
NiyAlOx catalysts
was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). Figure 3 plots representative XPS spectra of the Ni 2p, Ni 3p, and
Al 2p core levels for Ni6AlOx. Additional spectra for the remaining catalysts can be found in
the Supporting Information (Figures S1–S5). The deconvoluted Ni 2p
core level (Figure 3a) can be assigned to two spin–orbit coupling levels for the
Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 states. Both states show
a main band in the range 855.7–856.9 eV (Ni 2p3/2) and 873.4–874.5 eV (Ni 2p1/2) corresponding to
Ni2+, whereas the small band (<5% surface) in the range
852.0–853.4 eV (Ni 2p3/2) and 871.2–872.5
eV (Ni 2p1/2) can be attributed to Ni0.23−26 A broad band is also present at 861.7–862.7 eV (Ni 2p3/2) and 879.7–881.5 eV (Ni 2p1/2) which
can be assigned to the shake-up satellite band of NiO. Distinctive
bands ascribed to Ni2+ and shake-up satellites can also
be observed in the deconvoluted spectra of the Ni 3p core level (Figure 3b). This level is
also constituted by two states with BEs for Ni2+ in the
range 67.3–68.5 eV (Ni 3p3/2) and 68.8–69.6
eV (Ni 3p1/2).25,26 Finally, the Al 2p
core level also exhibits two spin–orbit coupling levels with
BEs in the range 73.6–75.0 eV (Al 2p3/2) and 74.3–76.3
eV (Al 2p1/2), reflecting the presence of Al3+ either in the oxide, oxyhydroxide, or hydroxide form (Figure 3b).25,26

Table 1 (columns
5 and 6) lists the bulk and surface Ni/Al molar ratios [that is, (Ni/Al)b and (Ni/Al)s] of the NiyAlOx catalysts measured by inductively
coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP–OES) and
XPS, respectively. In all cases, the (Ni/Al)b bulk ratios
are slightly lower than the nominal ratios. Interestingly, the (Ni/Al)s surface ratios are higher than the (Ni/Al)b bulk
ratios for Ni1AlOx (3.8 vs
0.9), Ni2AlOx (4.0 vs 1.6),
and Ni4AlOx (4.0 vs 3.0), whereas
the opposite trend is observed for the highly Ni-loaded catalysts,
that is, Ni8AlOx (6.2 vs 7.2)
and Ni10AlOx (7.3 vs 8.9).
In the case of Ni6AlOx, both
ratios show similar values (5.5 vs 5.1). In line with the XRD patterns,
these results can be interpreted by a partial encapsulation of Ni
and NiO nanoparticles by alumina for Ni6AlOx, Ni8AlOx,
and Ni10AlOx, whereas Ni and
NiO nanoparticles are expected to be mostly exposed on the alumina
surface for Ni1AlOx, Ni2AlOx, and Ni4AlOx.

Table 1 (columns
2–4) also lists the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
surface area, average pore size, and pore volume of the different
catalysts measured by N2 adsorption/desorption at −196
°C. The BET surface area decreases gradually with the Ni content
from 273 m2/g for Ni1AlOx to 81 m2/g for Ni10AlOx. Likewise, the pore volume declines with the Ni content from
0.51 cm3/g for Ni1AlOx to 0.30 cm3/g for Ni10AlOx. In parallel, the average pore size increases from
3.8 nm for Ni1AlOx to 7.3 nm
for Ni10AlOx.

We conducted
a first series of catalytic tests for the hydrogenation
and RA of HMF over Ni6AlOx (Table 2). Ni6AlOx can efficiently catalyze the hydrogenation
of HMF into 2,5-furandimethanol (FMA) at 70 °C and 10 bar H2 with 92% yield (entry 1). At 100 °C, 2,5-tetrahydrofuran-dimethanol
(THFMA) is obtained with 95% yield (entry 2). When NH3 is
added to the reaction system at 1 bar H2, 5-aminomethyl-2-furylmethanol
(FAA) is generated as main product with 98% yield at the expense of
FMA and THFMA (entry 3). At higher H2 pressure (10 bar)
and temperature (150 °C), 5-aminomethyl-2-tetrahydro-furylmethanol
(THFAA) is obtained as main product with 95% yield (entry 4) at the
expense of FAA. FAA is fast generated during the initial 3 h reaction
and becomes gradually hydrogenated to THFAA during the first 10 h
at full HMF conversion (Figure 4).

With these results in
hand, we explored the performance of the
NiyAlOx catalysts
toward FAA formation in the RA of HMF with NH3 at 100 °C
for 6 h under 1 bar H2 (Table 3). Ni1AlOx exhibits low HMF conversion (65%) and FAA yield (32%) together
with a poor mass balance (70%). FMA issued from HMF hydrogenation
is generated as minor byproduct with only 2.3% yield. An increase
of the Ni/Al molar ratio to 2 and 4 enhances moderately the HMF conversion,
the FAA yield, and the mass balance. The best performance is achieved
when the nominal Ni/Al molar ratio is set at either 6 or 8, resulting
in full HMF conversion and 99% FAA yield together with 99% mass balance.
FMA only appears as trace byproduct. A further increase of the Ni/Al
molar ratio to 10 leads to a slight decline of the FMA yield (96%)
at full HMF conversion with 96% mass balance. For comparison, the
RA of HMF with NH3 was also studied over a NiOx catalyst prereduced at 450 °C for 2 h under
H2 flow and over Raney-Ni. In both cases, low FAA yield
is obtained (33 and 48%, respectively) at high HMF conversion with
a modest mass balance (45 and 53%, respectively). This body of results
points out a positive effect of Al in NiyAlOx on the FAA selectivity, which is
especially pronounced for Ni6AlOx and Ni8AlOx, encompassing
partial encapsulation of metal Ni by alumina. In light of these results
and to its lower Ni content, Ni6AlOx was further used for optimizing the catalyst loading targeting
FAA (Table 4). In these
tests, a catalyst loading in the range 40–50 mg afforded 99%
FAA yield at full HMF conversion while keeping the other reaction
conditions unchanged. This catalyst loading was further used for expanding
the reaction scope.

In a next step of our study, we assessed the catalytic performance
of Ni6AlOx in the RA of a series
of aldehydes and ketones with NH3 (Table 5). FF can be aminated to give FAM with excellent
yield (90%) at 100 °C for 5 h under 4 bar H2 (entry
2). Likewise, aromatic aldehydes can be successfully aminated to the
corresponding primary amines. Indeed, benzaldehydes substituted with
electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., 4-anisaldehyde
and 4-chloro-benzaldehyde) can be transformed into the target amines
with >80% yield (entries 3 and 4). Ni6AlOx also enables the RA of vanillin, which is an important
flavor
in sweet foods, into the corresponding primary amine by reaction at
100 °C for 10 h under 2 bar H2 with 82% yield (entry
5). Aliphatic aldehydes such as butyraldehyde can be converted into
1-butylamine at low temperature (80 °C) with 83% yield (entry
6). Unlike aldehydes, the RA of ketones is often challenging because
of their lower reactivity. However, Ni6AlOx can provide high amine yields for several important
biomass-derived ketones such as cyclohexanone and isobutyl ketone
(89 and 84%, respectively) (entries 7 and 8). Finally, glycolaldehyde
(dimer), which can be produced by hydrolysis and retro-aldol condensation
of cellulose, can be transformed into ethanolamine with 85% yield
by reaction at 80 °C for 3 h under 5 bar H2 (entry
9).

c 0.5 mmol of the substrate.

We also explored the credentials of Ni6AlOx for preparing HMF-derived amines
(Table 6). The reaction
of HMF with
primary and secondary amines can afford the corresponding secondary
and tertiary amines in good yield by reaction at 100 °C for 6
h under 3 bar H2. Aromatic amines such as benzylamine and
aniline can react with HMF to produce the corresponding secondary
amines with 76 and 85% yield (entries 1 and 2), respectively. A secondary
amine such as morpholine can also react with HMF to generate the tertiary
amine with high yield (88%, entry 3). Finally, a yield >80% of
secondary
amines can be achieved with aliphatic amines such as 1-butylamine
and ethanolamine (entries 4 and 5).

c Co-solvent (1 mL of

fatty amines
in H2O.

More
importantly, we found that Ni6AlOx could catalyze the RA of HMF with NH3 toward FAA
in a gram-scale synthesis with high yield. As shown in Scheme 1, by stirring a mixture of
3 g of HMF and 30 mL of aqueous NH3 (28 et %) at 90 °C
for 12 h under 10 bar H2 over Ni6AlOx, FAA can be obtained with 81% isolated
yield.

Scheme 1 Scale-Up Synthesis of FAA from the RA of HMF
Finally, we explored the catalyst recycling
and reuse using the
same operation conditions as in Table 2 (entry 3). The catalyst can be separated and reused
in four consecutive runs without apparent loss of activity (Figure 5). Nonetheless, after
the fifth and sixth runs, a drop in the HMF conversion is observed,
which can be ascribed to a progressive catalyst loss during operation
as the turnover number (TON) of the catalyst measured with respect
to the bulk Ni keeps almost unchanged at a value of 2.3 mmol FAA/mmol
Ni. Noticeably, the catalytic performance can be recovered if the
lost catalyst, that is, 20 mg, is compensated by the addition of fresh
Ni6AlOx. The catalyst keeps
its integrity during operation, as can be deduced by the comparison
of the XRD patterns and XPS spectra of the Ni 2p, Ni 3p, and Al 2p
core levels before and after the first and fifth runs (Figures S6–S8). However, after the fifth
run, characteristic reflections ascribed to γ-alumina can be
distinguished at 25°, 34°, 37°, 54°, 65°,
and 67°, which can be assigned to AL(111), AL(220), AL(311),
AL(400), AL(511), and AL (440) (γ-Al2O3, JCPDS no: 10-0425, Fd3m cubic
unit cell), respectively. This observation suggests a partial recrystallization
of the initially amorphous alumina phase during the reaction. The
(Ni/Al)b bulk molar ratio of the fresh and spent catalyst
after the fifth run as analyzed by ICP–OES is 5.2 and 4.9,
respectively, suggesting a slight leaching of nickel during the reaction.

HMF. Reaction conditions as in Table 2 (entry 3). The experiment at run 7 was conducted
by adding 20 mg of the catalyst to compensate the catalyst loss along
runs 1–6.

Conclusions
Along
this study, we have demonstrated that NiyAlOx formulations can behave as
efficient and versatile catalysts for the RA of a broad series of
biomass-derived aldehydes and ketones in aqueous ammonia at mild reaction
conditions. By tuning the Ni/Al molar ratio, Ni6AlOx was found to be an optimal formulation.
This catalyst offered high selectivity and yield to primary amines
by reacting carbonyl compounds with aqueous ammonia. In particular,
FF and HMF could react with a variety of primary and secondary amines
to afford highly substituted amines. The catalyst could be easily
recycled and reused without apparent loss of activity in four consecutive
runs.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Al(NO3)3·9H2O, and
Na2CO3, all supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent
Co., Ltd. were used for the preparation of the NiyAlOx formulations. A Ni–Al
alloy (50:50 w/w) supplied by J&K Chemical Co., Ltd. was used
for preparing RaneyNi. FF, 4-anisaldehyde, 4-chlorobenzaldehyde, vanillin,
butyraldehyde, 1-butylamine, 2-butylamine, cyclohexanone, cyclohexylamine,
butanone, ethanolamine, aniline, benzylamine, and morpholine were
also supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. HMF, FMA, THFMA,
FAA, and THFAA were procured from Shanghai Shaoyuan Co., Ltd. Glycolaldehyde
was purchased from Ark Pharm, Inc. Dioxane, ethanol and aqueous ammonia
solution (28 wt %) were purchased from Damao Chemical Reagent Factory.
Hydrogen was obtained commercially from Lanzhou Yulong Gas Co., LTD.
All the chemicals were used as received without further purification.

Catalyst Preparation
The NiyAlOx formulations were prepared as follows.
In a typical preparation, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (4.66 g, 16 mmol) and Al(NO3)3·9H2O (1 g, 2.67 mmol) were added to deionized water (30 mL) at
room temperature and stirred until complete dissolution. Then, aqueous
Na2CO3 (20 mL, 1.25 M) was added dropwise and
the mixture was stirred for 5 h, followed by centrifugation and washing
with deionized water until neutral pH was reached. Finally, the solid
was dried at 100 °C in air for 5 h, calcined at 450 °C for
4 h, and reduced at 450 °C for 2 h under 10 cm3(STP)/min
H2 flow using a 10 °C/min heating ramp. The Ni/Al
ratio in the formulations was tuned by adjusting the Ni/Al molar ratio
in the system. A NiOx catalyst was also
prepared using the same protocol, but without addition of the Al(NO3)3·9H2O precursor.

RaneyNi
was prepared according to a previous study.22 Briefly, 10.0 g of Ni–Al alloy (50:50 w/w) was slowly added
to an aqueous solution of NaOH (6.0 M, 50 mL) under stirring over
ice water and a controlled temperature in the range 10–20 °C
for 1 h, followed by 30 min at room temperature and heating to 90
°C under stirring for 2 h until no H2 bubbles were
observed. Then, the mixture was cooled down to room temperature and
the final black precipitate was washed with distilled water until
pH 7 and kept in water or ethanol.

Catalyst Characterization
The bulk metal composition
of the catalysts was quantified by ICP analysis using an Activa (HORIBA
Jobin-Yvon) Optical Emission Spectrometer. Before the measurements,
the samples were dissolved using a mixture of inorganic acids (H2SO4, HNO3, and HF).

TEM was carried
out using a Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin Field microscope operating at 300
kV equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis in
the scanning TEM mode. For TEM inspection, the prereduced catalysts
were suspended in ethanol by ultrasonication and deposited on carbon-coated
copper grids.

The XRD patterns were measured using a STADIP-automated
transmission
diffractometer (STOE) equipped with an incident-beam curved Ge monochromator
with Cu Kα1 radiation and operated at 40 kV and 150
mA.

XPS was used for measuring the surface composition of the
catalysts
on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD apparatus equipped with a hemispherical
analyzer and a delay line detector. The spectra were recorded using
an Al monochromated X-ray source (10 kV, 15 mA) with a pass energy
of 40 eV (0.1 eV/step) and a pass energy of 160 eV in the hybrid mode.
The adventitious C 1s binding energy (285.0 eV) was used as an internal
reference.

The specific surface area of the catalysts was measured
by N2 adsorption/desorption at −196 °C on a
Quantachrome
IQ2 instrument. The pore size distribution was calculated from the
desorption isotherms using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
method. Prior to the measurements, the samples were degassed at 300
°C for 10 h to remove adsorbed moisture and vapors.

Catalytic Tests
The catalysts were tested in the liquid-phase
amination reaction of HMF with NH3. The catalytic tests
were conducted in an 80 mL stainless steel autoclave equipped with
a pressure gauge and a safety valve. In a typical experiment, the
reactor was charged with 1 mmol of HMF, 3 mL of NH3·H2O (28 wt %) solution and 50 mg of the prereduced catalyst.
The reactor was sealed and evacuated by applying vacuum followed by
H2 charging. The reactor was then placed on a hot plate
equipped with a magnetic stirrer at the desired temperature, the pressure
was equilibrated, and the reaction was conducted at variable times.

The reactant (HMF) and the N-products were analyzed and quantified
using an Agilent 7890A GC equipped with a HP-5 capillary column with
5 wt % phenyl groups and an FID detector, using dioxane as the internal
standard. Besides, the isolated yields were measured by flash column
chromatography. The 1H NMR spectra were measured using
a Bruker ARX 400 or ARX 100 spectrometer at 400 MHz (1H)
and 100 MHz (13C). All the spectra were recorded in CD3OD.

The HMF conversion, the selectivity and yield to
N-products, the
mass balance, and the TON (FAA) were defined as follows 1   2   3   4   5  where nHMF0 and nHMF refer to the initial and final
HMF mole number, respectively, ni indicates the mole number
of the N-products, and nNi (bulk) refers
to the mole number of bulk Ni in the reactor.
