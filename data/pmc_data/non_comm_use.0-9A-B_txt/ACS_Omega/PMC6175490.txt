==== Body
Page 7029. Figure 3 is replaced by the corrected
figure below. Part (b) of the caption is also corrected.

Figure 3 (a) Electronic
absorption spectra of [Ag(H2BzPh)NO3]
(1) in the absence (black line) and in the presence (colored
lines) of increasing amounts of CT-DNA. The arrow shows the changes
upon addition of increasing amounts of CT-DNA. (b) Plots of [Af – Aa] versus
[DNA] (ΔA = ΔAmax [DNA]/Kd + [DNA]; Kb = 1/Kd). Inset: Plots of
[DNA]/(εa – εf) versus [DNA]
([DNA] = 0–20 μM, [complex] = 30 μM at 25 °C
in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2).

Page 7030. The title of Table 3 must be corrected (insertion of the word “Approximate”),
as well as the first column of Table 3. The corrected table is below.
