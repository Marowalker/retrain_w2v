An
untargeted metabolomics approach was utilized to determine urinary
metabolites that could serve as small-molecule biomarkers for treatment
response to standard tuberculosis treatment. However, the majority
of metabolites that most accurately distinguished patient samples
at the time of diagnosis from those at 1 month after the start of
therapy lacked structural identification. The detection of unknown
metabolite structures is a well-known limitation of untargeted metabolomics
and underscores a need for continued elucidation of novel metabolite
structures. In this study, we sought to define the structure of a
urine metabolite with an experimentally determined mass of 202.1326
Da, classified as molecular feature (MF) 202.1326. A hypothesized
structure of N1-acetylisoputreanine was
developed for MF 202.1326 using in silico tools and liquid chromatography–tandem
mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). In the absence of a commercial
standard, synthetic N1-acetylisoputreanine
was generated using enzymatic and chemical syntheses, and LC–MS/MS
was used to confirm the structure of MF 202.1326 as N1-acetylisoputreanine, a proposed terminal polyamine catabolite
that had not been previously detected in biological samples. Further
analysis demonstrated that N1-acetylisoputreanine
and an alternative form of this metabolite, N1-acetylisoputreanine-γ-lactam, are both present in human
urine and are likely end-products of polyamine metabolism.

Introduction
Metabolomics is a growing field that has
yielded numerous metabolites
with abundant changes correlating to a variety of diseases and phenotypes.1,2 However, a major challenge in mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics
research has been the structural confirmation of individual metabolites,
including differentiation of targeted metabolites from those compounds
that share an identical monoisotopic mass and are of the same chemical
class, as well as identification of metabolites that are not currently
listed in available metabolite databases.1,3,4 The structural elucidation of a small-molecule
metabolite can be a complex and time-consuming process.3,5 This is particularly true when de novo characterization is required
(Figure 1) and even
automated methods used to search tandem-MS (MS/MS) data against established
metabolite databases only predict the metabolite’s structure.6 A putative chemical identification can be achieved
by interrogating available metabolite databases with an experimentally
derived accurate mass, m/z, or a
molecular formula.3,7,8 Further
confidence in the putative identification can be obtained by in silico
database analyses using the targeted analyte’s experimental
fragmentation pattern (MS/MS or MSn spectra).3,7,8 However, a confirmed structural
identification is only achieved by demonstrating that the targeted
metabolite has the same properties (accurate mass, MS/MS spectra,
and retention time (RT)) as an authentic chemical standard under identical
analytical conditions.3,7,8 Owing
to the complexity of metabolic processes, a large number of small
molecules observed in biological samples are not annotated in the
available metabolite databases, nor do they have authentic chemical
standards. In fact, more than 50% of the small molecules observed
in four recent metabolomics studies were labeled as unidentified.9−12 This limitation in untargeted metabolomics studies results in an
underestimation of the chemical diversity and biological importance
of small molecules present in biological samples and underscores the
need for continued elucidation of novel metabolite structures.

Figure 1 Processes required
for structural identification of molecular features
(MFs) detected via untargeted LC–MS-based metabolomics and
the different levels of identification based on guidelines provided
by the Metabolomics Standards Initiatives.3,8 The
accurate mass of an MF of interest is interrogated against existing
databases, a match to one or more annotated metabolites provides a
putative identification, level 3. MS/MS spectrum of a level 3 metabolite
or MF with no matches to annotated metabolites still provides increased
structural information. A direct match of the experimental MS/MS spectrum
to that of an annotated metabolite provides a level 2 putative structural
identification. A partial match of the experimental MS/MS spectrum
to that associated with one or more annotated metabolites can be used
to derive a hypothesis for the metabolite structure, and experimental
approaches can be undertaken to further elucidate or confirm the structure.
This can be an iterative approach. A direct match of the metabolite’s
mass, MS/MS spectra, and RT to that of an authentic standard under
identical analytical conditions provides for full confirmation of
structural identification, level 1 identity. The inability to use
experimental mass or MS/MS data to identify or elucidate a structure
results in the MF being designated as an unknown compound, level 4.

Previously, application of untargeted
liquid chromatography (LC)–MS-based
metabolomics to select small-molecule biomarkers of treatment response
in tuberculosis (TB) patients identified 12 candidate biomarkers.10 Seven of these small molecules, also referred
to as MFs, were matched via their accurate masses to compounds in
the METLIN metabolite database or Human Metabolome Database (HMDB),
giving them putative identifications; however, none of the identifications
was confirmed. One of these MFs (MF 202.1326), defined by an accurate
mass of 202.1326 Da and an RT of 3.89 min, was given a putative identification
of a dipeptide containing isoleucine/leucine and alanine.10 In this current study, efforts to fully elucidate
the structure of this MF revealed that it was not a dipeptide, but
a product with a previously unrecognized structure. MS/MS along with
chemical and enzymatic synthesis provided a confirmed identity for
the MF as N1-acetylisoputreanine, a catabolite
of polyamine metabolism that had been predicted13,14 but had not been detected in human biological fluids before this
study.

Results and Discussion
LC–MS/MS Investigation of a Structurally
Undefined MF
MF 202.1326, a putative metabolite of urine
with an experimentally
determined accurate mass of 202.1326 Da and a predicted formula of
C9H18N2O3, displayed relative
shifts in abundance correlating with anti-TB therapy and was given
a putative structural identification of a dipeptide containing isoleucine/leucine
and alanine.10 An evaluation of a leucyl-alanine
standard revealed an 11.097 min RT using reverse-phase chromatography,
and this was significantly different from the 3.707 min RT of endogenous
MF 202.1326 (Figure 2A). This not only established that MF 202.1326 was not leucyl-alanine,
but that MF 202.1326 was unlikely to contain a nonpolar side chain
like that of leucine and isoleucine.

information. (A) Extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) of m/z 203.1390 from LC–MS data of human urine

The peak at 11.1 min is leucyl–alanine. (B) LC–MS/MS
spectra of MF 202.1326 at three collision energies; 10 V (top), 20
V (middle), and 40 V (bottom). (C) LC–MS/MS spectrum of MF
202.1326 (top) compared to that of N1-acetylspermine
(middle) and N1,N12-diacetylspermine (bottom). All spectra were obtained with
a collision energy of 20 V. The fragment ions m/z 100.076, 72.045, and 58.066 are present in the spectra
of all three compounds.

To gain insight into the structure of MF 202.1326, we applied
LC–MS/MS
(Figure 2B). The fragment
ions m/z 185.128, 126.091, 100.076,
72.045, and 58.066 were recurrent regardless of the collision energy
applied, indicating that they were specific fragments originating
from the intact molecule. The fragment ion m/z 100.076 was highly abundant even at lower collision energies.
This was representative of fragmentation occurring at a highly labile
bond such as a C–N bond.

Molecules with similar structures
or of the same class can share
identical fragment ions.15,16 To assess this possibility
for MF 202.1326, we queried the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) MS/MS spectral database to determine whether partial
matches occurred between the MS/MS spectrum of MF 202.1326 and the
annotated spectra of known compounds. A partial match to the MS/MS
spectrum of N1-acetylspermine with fragment
ions m/z 100.076, 72.045, and 58.066
was obtained. These common fragment ions are also present in the available
METLIN and HMDB MS/MS spectra for two other acetylated polyamines, N1-acetylspermidine and N1,N12-diacetylspermine. Using authentic
standards for N1-acetylspermine and N1,N12-diacetylspermine,
we confirmed that these annotated fragment ions were replicated in
MS/MS experiments with our instrument (Figure 2C). Interestingly, all three compounds shared
the dominant m/z 100.076 fragment
ion.

Establishing the Hypothesis for N1-Acetylisoputreanine as the Structure of MF 202.1326
Theoretical
fragmentation of N1-acetylspermine indicated
that the m/z 100.076 fragment ion
originated from fragmentation of the C–N bond that separates
the acetamidopropyl group and spermidine (Figure 3A). To demonstrate that the m/z 100.076 fragment ion of MF 202.1326 also represents
an acetamidopropyl group, we targeted this product ion for further
fragmentation using an improvised MS3 approach. Specifically,
increased fragmentor voltage was applied to induce in-source fragmentation
and generate the m/z 100.076 fragment
ion for subsequent MS3 fragmentation in the collision cell.17,18 Throughout this article, MS3 refers to results obtained
using this improvised MS3 approach. The MS3 fragmentation
spectra of m/z 100.076 derived from
MF 202.1326 and N1-acetylspermine were
nearly identical (Figure 3B). This signified that both molecules possessed an acetamidopropyl
group. Theoretical fragmentation of the acetamidopropyl group provided
additional support for the structural identity of the m/z 100.076 fragment ion (Figure 3C). Specifically, the MS3 fragments m/z 58.066 and 43.018 would have resulted
from fragmentation of the labile C–N separating the acetyl
group and propylamine (Figure 3B,C). N1-Acetylspermine is a monoacetyl
conjugate produced during polyamine metabolism. Acetylation of polyamines
reduces the charge of these molecules and facilitates their export
from the cell, as well as increases metabolic flux through the polyamine
pathway.19,20 The presence of an acetamidopropyl group
in MF 202.1326 led us to infer that it might also be involved in polyamine
metabolism.

of the m/z 100.076 fragment ion.

Typical fragmentation of a parent
ion can generate a charged fragment
and a corresponding neutral fragment, the latter of which is not detected
in the MS/MS spectra. Thus, having determined that one portion of
MF 202.1326 contained an acetamidopropyl group, a neutral loss fragment
of 103.063 Da was hypothesized (Figure 4). The 103.063 Da neutral loss fragment was interrogated
against the ChemSpider database, and 150 potential structures were
matched to this mass, with γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) being
the highest ranked. GABA is also produced during polyamine metabolism13 leading us to hypothesize that C-3 of the acetamidopropyl
group was linked to the sole nitrogen of GABA, creating a C–N
bond in MF 202.1326 similar to that of N1-acetylspermine (compare Figures 3A and 4). Additional support
for the predicted structure of MF 202.1326 was the m/z 185.128 fragment ion (Figure 2B) that was indicative of a neutral loss
of water via fragmentation of the −OH group in GABA. This structure
matched with a predicted, but never detected, catabolite of polyamine
metabolism, N1-acetylisoputreanine13 (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Hypothesized structure of MF 202.1326, N1-acetylisoputreanine. Fragmentation at the proximal C–N bond
would yield an m/z 100.076 fragment
ion [M + H]+ attributed to an acetamidopropyl group, and
a neutral loss of 103.0633 Da [M] can be attributed to a hypothesized
GABA constituent.

Confirmation of MF 202.1326
as N1-Acetylisoputreanine
Confirmation
of the structural identity
of MF 202.1326 as N1-acetylisoputreanine
required an authentic chemical standard, but one was not commercially
available. Thus, a combined enzymatic and chemical synthesis approach
was employed to generate a standard compound (Figure 5A). This approach exploited a previously
purified and enzymatically characterized amine oxidase, N1-acetylpolyamine oxidase (PAOX), which produces the reactive
aldehyde, 3-acetamidopropanol, upon catabolism of N1-acetylspermine and N1-acetylspermidine.13,21 The addition of PAOX to N1-acetylspermine
(Figure 5B) resulted
in the formation of 3-acetamidopropanol and spermidine (Figure 5C), and the addition of excess
GABA in the presence of the reducing agent allowed the formation of N1-acetylisoputreanine (Figure 5D). In the absence of PAOX, GABA, or a reducing
agent, there was no formation of N1-acetylisoputreanine
in the positive mode (data not shown). The MS/MS spectra for the synthetic
compound and the endogenous MF 202.1326 were identical, confirming
that the unknown metabolite is N1-acetylisoputreanine
(Figure 6B). Further
confirmation was achieved by spiking the synthetic compound into urine,
which yielded an increase in the endogenous MF 202.1326 peak (Figure 6A).

Both N1-Acetylisoputreanine and N1-Acetylisoputreanine-γ-lactam Are Endogenous
Components of Human Urine
There has been no previous report
of N1-acetylisoputreanine in biological
samples; however, the γ-lactam form of N1-acetylisoputreanine, N-(3-acetamidopropyl)pyrrolidin-2-one,
was previously described and quantified in urine.22,23 One possibility for N1-acetylisoputreanine
not being detected in the previous studies was the use of gas chromatography
(GC)–MS to detect metabolites extracted from urine without
prior derivatization. Owing to the polarity of the carboxylic acid, N1-acetylisoputreanine would have lacked the
proper volatility for GC–MS or failed to be extracted with
dichloromethane. It is also noted that other studies describe the
detection of nonconjugated isoputreanine in the urine of animals following
their exposure to spermidine.24−26 However, the urine was subjected
to acid hydrolysis before detection, and this would have hydrolyzed
the γ-lactam ring and removed acetyl groups; thus, it was concluded
that isoputreanine-γ-lactam and N1-acetylisoputreanine-γ-lactam were the natural excretory products
following oxidative deamination of spermidine and N1-acetylspermidine, respectively.14

We wanted to confirm the presence of N1-acetylisoputreanine-γ-lactam in human urine using our
analytical methods. A peak with the m/z value of 185.129 corresponding to N1-acetylisoputreanine-γ-lactam was present in the urine (Figure 7A). This m/z 185.129 peak had the same RT and MS/MS
fragmentation as those of a synthetic standard and addition of the
standard compound to the urine resulted in an increase in the endogenous
peak (Figure 7A,B).
Because N1-acetylisoputreanine-γ-lactam
is presumed to be the natural excretory product, we assessed whether N1-acetylisoputreanine was a potential artifact
of the analytical method we applied. Analysis of synthetic N1-acetylisoputreanine-γ-lactam on its
own using our analytical method did not result in an additional peak
for N1-acetylisoputreanine (Figure 7A). This provided evidence
that hydrolysis of the γ-lactam ring was not occurring during
the assay. There are also enzymes present in the urine that could
lead to enzymatic interconversion between N1-acetylisoputreanine and N1-acetylisoputreanine-γ-lactam.27 Thus, fresh human urine was evaluated for enzymatic
interconversion. The addition of N1-acetylisoputreanine-γ-lactam
to fresh urine followed by incubation at room temperature for 24 h
did not alter the abundance of N1-acetylisoputreanine
(Figure 7A), and the
levels of endogenous N1-acetylisoputreanine
and N1-acetylisoputreanine-γ-lactam
did not noticeably change over 24 h (Table 1). If enzymatic interconversion between the
two compounds had occurred, a decrease in the peak area of one compound
and a corresponding increase in the peak area of the other would have
been observed. This did not occur (Table 1). These evaluations provide strong evidence
that N1-acetylisoputreanine and N1-acetylisoputreanine-γ-lactam are endogenous
components of human urine; there is no enzymatic interconversion;
and N1-acetylisoputreanine does not result
from spontaneous hydrolysis of the ring structure of N1-acetylisoputreanine-γ-lactam.

Origin of N1-Acetylisoputreanine
The origin of N1-acetylisoputreanine
has not been determined due to its unconfirmed existence before this
study. However, the origin of N1-acetylisoputreanine-γ-lactam
has been investigated. Aminoguanidine treatment of rats greatly diminished
the urinary levels of N1-acetylisoputreanine-γ-lactam.22,28 Because aminoguanidine is an inhibitor of copper-dependent amino
oxidases (CuAO), it was concluded that N1-acetylisoputreanine-γ-lactam is formed due to amine oxidation
of N1-acetylspermidine by CuAO, followed
by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity (Figure 8).13,22,28 On the basis of this, we hypothesize that N1-acetylisoputreanine is also formed due to the action of CuAO
and that a separate ALDH enzyme results in N1-acetylisoputreanine rather than the γ-lactam form (Figure 8).29 Further studies are required to confirm the enzymes involved
in the formation of N1-acetylisoputreanine
and to determine the mechanisms underlying its association with TB
treatment.

Polyamine metabolism, a metabolic
pathway with increasing interest,
has been examined in relation to cancer and other diseases using metabolomics-based
techniques.30−35 The polycationic property of polyamines enables these metabolites
to regulate biological processes through reversible ionic interactions
with negatively charged molecules such as nucleic acids, proteins,
and phospholipids.36−41 Thus, polyamines act as important factors in cell growth and differentiation,
requiring their levels to be tightly regulated via the polyamine interconversion
cycle and cellular transport (Figure 8).13,42 Therefore, a flux in polyamine
levels during a disease state likely reflects a perturbation of these
homeostasis mechanisms. Elucidation of all products of polyamine metabolism
will allow for a better understanding of their biological roles and
how they are regulated during disease.

Conclusions
A
combination of LC–MS fragmentation along with enzymatic
and chemical approaches was utilized to confirm the structure of a
significant but previously unidentified metabolite, N1-acetylisoputreanine. The presented data established
that both N1-acetylisoputreanine and the
previously described N1-acetylisoputreanine-γ-lactam
are endogenous products detectable in human urine. In addition, the
results from this study demonstrated that metabolite identification
based on database interrogation of MS data alone has significant limitations
and that novel metabolites belonging to established pathways are present
in biological fluid and should not be presumed as an artifact of sample
analyses. Furthermore, this work underscores the importance of confirming
metabolite structural identities.

Experimental Section
Materials
Glycine, N1-acetylspermine,
GABA, N-(3-aminopropyl)pyrrolidin-2-one, acetyl chloride,
and sodium triacetoxyborohydride were obtained from Sigma Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO). LC–MS grade water, methanol, and acetonitrile
were from Honeywell Burdick & Jackson (Muskegon, MI). Formic acid
was obtained from Fischer Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Bulk human
urine was obtained from Gemini Bio-Products (West Sacramento, CA).
Fresh human urine was obtained from healthy donors at Colorado State
University. Patient urine for metabolite identification was from a
subset of the samples used for metabolite discovery in the previously
published study.10

LC and MS Analysis
Chromatography was based on the
previously described method using an Agilent 1200 series high-performance
LC system (Agilent Technologies; Palo Alto, CA) coupled with an Atlantis
T3 reverse-phase C18 3.5 μm column (2.1 mm × 150 mm; Waters
Corp., Milford, MA).10 MS was performed
using an Agilent 6520 quadrupole time of flight LC–MS instrument
equipped with an Agilent electrospray ionization source that was operated
in the positive ionization mode. The operating conditions for the
mass spectrometer were: gas temperature, 300 °C; drying gas,
8 L/min; nebulizer, 45 lb/in.2; capillary voltage, 2000
V; fragmentation energy for MS and MS/MS, 120 V; fragmentation energy
to generate the m/z 100.0757 product
ion, 200 V; skimmer voltage, 60 V; and octapole RF setting, 750 V.
Specified ions were subjected to MS/MS fragmentation (isolation width
of 1.3 Da) by collision-induced dissociation at set collision energies
(5–40 V). Data were collected in the profile and centroid modes
at a scan rate of 2.0 spectra/s and a scan range of m/z 50–1700 using the Agilent MassHunter Data
Acquisition software.

Purification of PAOX
A plasmid construct
(pET15b/hPAO-1)
was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) STAR. The expression of hPAO-1 and purification of recombinant
PAOX was performed as previously described.21 Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin (Qiagen; Valencia, CA)
was used for immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. Purified
protein was dialyzed in 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mM NaCl,
0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.2
μM flavin adenine dinucleotide, and stored at 4 °C.

Synthesis
of N1-Acetylisoputreanine
and N1-Acetylisoputreanine-γ-lactam
A modification of the previously described enzyme assay was applied
in the synthesis of N1-acetylisoputreanine.21N1-acetylspermine
at 0.25 mM was combined with purified recombinant PAOX (0.6 mg/mL)
in 88 mM glycine buffer (pH 8.0) for 30 min at room temperature. GABA
(final concentration of 10 mM) was subsequently added. An aliquot
(500 μL) of this mixture was added to 4.5 mL of 90% ethanol
containing 1% (w/v) sodium triacetoxyborohydride and incubated at
RT for 4 h. The reaction was dried in a Savant SpeedVac and resuspended
in 500 μL of water and stored at 4 °C until LC–MS
analysis. Before LC–MS analysis, the synthetic compound was
diluted 1:10 in water or human urine.

N1-Acetylisoputreanine-γ-lactam was synthesized as previously
described.23 Acetylation was performed
with N-(3-aminopropyl)pyrrolidin-2-one (0.75 M) and
acetyl chloride (0.75 M) in methanol and 0.5 M PBS (1:1) adjusted
to pH 7.0 with sodium hydroxide. The reaction products were extracted
with dichloromethane, dried, suspended in 2 mL of LC–MS grade
water and stored at 4 °C before LC–MS analyses, the synthetic
compound was diluted 1:100 in water or human urine.

Evaluation
of N1-Acetylisoputreanine
and N1-Acetylisoputreanine-γ-lactam
in Fresh Urine
Fresh urine obtained from healthy donors was
stored at 4 °C and processed within 4 h of collection. An initial
aliquot of fresh urine was stored at −20 °C as the 0 h
time point sample. To a 90 μL aliquot of urine, either 10 μL
of water or N1-acetylisoputreanine-γ-lactam
was added, and the sample was kept at room temperature for 24 h. The
0 and 24 h time point samples were analyzed by LC–MS. The relative
abundance for N1-acetylisoputreanine and N1-acetylisoputreanine-γ-lactam was determined
as the peak area on the basis of an EIC of their respective [M + H]+m/z values. The peak areas
for the 24 h time point sample were corrected by dividing the peak
area by 0.9. The relative percent difference between the 0 (x1) and the 24 h (x2) time points was calculated for each molecule using the following
equation  

Data Analyses
The LC–MS/MS spectra were manually
interrogated against available MS/MS spectra in the METLIN metabolite
database, HMDB, and NIST.43−45 Theoretical fragment ions for
individual structures were obtained using ACD/MS Fragmenter (Advanced
Chemistry Development, Inc.; Toronto, ON, Canada).
