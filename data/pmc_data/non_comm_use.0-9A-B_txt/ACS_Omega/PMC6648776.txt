Since the recent experimental discovery
of the CrI3 and
CrGeTe3 monolayers, van der Waals (vdW) layered transition
metal compounds have been recognized as promising candidates to realize
2D ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductors. However, until now, only limited
compounds have been proposed to be ferromagnetic semiconductors. Here,
on the basis of first-principles calculations, we report that the
monolayer, Janus monolayer, and bilayer of NiX2 (X = Cl,
Br, I) are intrinsic 2D FM semiconductors. Our results show that exfoliation
energy of the NiX2 monolayer is smaller than that of graphene,
and all studied NiX2 layers show semiconducting band gaps.
The predicted Curie temperature values for NiX2 (X = Cl,
Br, I) monolayers ranged from 120 to 170 K with Monte Carlo simulations.
For the Janus monolayer, we found that the spin interaction shows
a very strong magnetoelectric coupling under an external electric
field. Furthermore, for the bilayer of NiX2, our results
show that the interlayer coupling is quite weak, indicating the possibility
of tuning the magnetic coupling through external manipulations.

Introduction
During the past decade, two-dimensional
(2D) materials, such as
graphene,1 h-BN,2 MoS2,3 and black phosphorus,4 have received much attention because of their
unique properties and potential applications in future nanodevices.5 Magnetism, especially in 2D systems, is one of
the most fascinating properties of materials, not only because of
the complex magnetic behavior itself but also due to its interplay
with the other important properties of materials such as superconductivity,
ferroelectricity, and quantum Hall effects. However, in early studies,
long-range magnetic order is predicted to be prohibited in a 2D system
according to the Mermin–Wagner theorem.6 Recently, Gong et al.7and Huang et al.8 reported their discovery of long-range ferromagnetic
(FM) order in 2D intrinsic semiconductors, Cr2Ge2Te6 and CrI3, which are exfoliated down to
atomically thin layers from their van der Waals (vdW) layered bulk
materials. These exciting findings promote the studies of 2D magnetic
semiconductors to a new stage. But the measured Curie temperature
(TC) values of these materials are very
low (<45 K), which badly hinders their practical applications in
spintronic devices.

Tremendous efforts have been devoted to
realize ferromagnetic order
in 2D semiconductors with higher Curie temperature. For example, embedding
transition metal atoms and applying strain, defects, or boundaries9−13 have been adopted as a strategy to induce magnetism in a nonmagnetic
system. But these methods are usually difficult to control in an experiment,
and the induced ferromagnetism is very weak. Recently, the vdW layered
transition metal compounds have been recognized as promising candidates
to realize 2D FM semiconductors because these materials usually possess
intrinsic magnetism and can be easily exfoliated down to monolayers.
Several 2D systems have been confirmed to be intrinsic FM materials
such as VSe2,14 MnSe2,15 FePS3,16 and MnO2,17 but all
these materials are metallic. 2D FM semiconductors are still very
rare, and their TC values are much below
room temperature because the virtual exchange interactions in a semiconductor
are usually much weaker than the carrier-driven exchange interactions
in a metallic system. Thus, to better understand the intrinsic mechanism
of ferromagnetic semiconductors, it becomes more and more important
to explore new families of semiconducting monolayers with ferromagnetism.

Here, on the basis of first-principles calculations, we predict
that the family of NiX2 (X = Cl, Br, I) layers can be promising
2D intrinsic FM semiconductors. Our results show that exfoliation
energy of the NiX2 monolayer is smaller than that of graphene,
and all the NiX2 monolayers show semiconducting band gaps,
which vary from 1.24 to 2.60 eV. Their Curie temperature (TC) values were predicted from 120 to 170 K with
Monte Carlo simulations. For the Janus monolayer, we found that the
spin interaction shows a very strong magnetoelectric coupling. Furthermore,
for the bilayer of NiX2, our results show that the interlayer
coupling is quite weak, indicating the possibility of tuning the magnetic
coupling through external manipulations.

Results and Discussion
The large interlayer distance between vdW layers (3.08, 3.28, and
3.35 Å for NiCl2, NiBr2, and NiI2, respectively) of NiX2 bulks implies a weak interlayer
interaction between layers and the possibility to obtain 2D monolayers
with a suitable exfoliation method. To demonstrate this, two fundamental
questions should be taken into account. One is the cleavage energy,
which gives a quantitative description of the strength of interlayer
binding, and the other one is the in-plane stiffness of the corresponding
2D monolayer, which determines whether the exfoliated monolayer can
have a large area and be free-standing. Generally, a small cleavage
energy and strong in-plane stiffness are what we need.

To achieve
the 2D monolayer from the vdW bulk crystals, the most
commonly used approaches are mechanical cleavage and liquid exfoliation.1,18,19 To confirm that it is possible
to exfoliate NiX2 monolayers from their bulk phases in
the experiment, we first calculated the cleavage energy. A gradually
expanded fracture is introduced in the bulk to simulate the exfoliation
procedure (Figure 1a,b).20 As expected, the total energy
increases as the separation between two fractured parts increases
(Figure 1c). It can
be found that the total energy increases rapidly when the separation
is less than 3.0 Å. As the separation becomes larger, the total
energy barely changes. Then, we find that the cleavage energies for
NiCl2, NiBr2, and NiI2 are 0.223,
0.242, and 0.26 J/m2, which are smaller than that for graphite
(∼0.36 J/m2),21,22 implying that NiX2 can be easily exfoliated down to the monolayer in the experiment.
We also calculate the cleavage energy of bilayer nanosheets and obtain
very similar values, which are 0.224, 0.243, and 0.26 J/m2.

energy with the 2D lattice constant for the monolayer of NiX2. The energy of equilibrium state is set to 0. (e) NiX2 monolayer. d0 is the vertical distance
between two halide atomic planes.

To obtain a free-standing membrane during the exfoliation
process
in the experiment, it is important to avoid curling or buckling. To
investigate the in-plane stiffness of NiX2 monolayers,
the 2D Young’s modulus is evaluated according to the following
equation  where E is the total energy
per unit cell, a0 is the 2D lattice constant,
and A is the corresponding surface area. Figure 1d shows the profile
of total energy versus lattice constant a0 for NiX2 monolayers. The 2D Young’s moduli for
NiCl2, NiBr2, and NiI2 are calculated
to be 54, 50, and 45 N m–1, respectively, which
are close to that of the MnPSe323 monolayer and comparable to that of the ultrastrong material graphene
(∼340 N m–1).24,25 Further, according
to the elastic theory, the typical out-of-plane deformation h induced by gravity can be estimated by the formula25  where p = 2.00 × 10–6, 3.06 × 10–6, and 3.78 ×
10–6 kg/m2 are the densities of 2D NiCl2, NiBr2, and NiI2, respectively, and L is the edge length. Assuming that L ≈
100 μm, we obtain h/L values of 3.31 ×
10–4, 3.91 × 10–4, and 4.35
× 10–4 for 2D NiCl2, NiBr2, and NiI2, respectively. These values are of the same
order of magnitude as that of graphene.25 These suggest that the NiX2 monolayers are stiff enough
to withstand its own weight and keep a free-standing planar structure
during exfoliation.

The NiX2 monolayers possess a
structure similar to that
of the T-MoS2 monolayer, which belong to the P-3m1 layer group. No Jahn–Teller distortion
is observed, and each Ni atom is coordinated to six ligands. The structural
parameters are listed in Table 1. As the atomic radius increases from NiCl2 to
NiI2, the lattice constant a0, bond length of Ni–X atom marked as dNi–X, and vertical distance between two halide planes d0 also increase. The calculated lattice constants a0 of the monolayers are very close to those
of their bulks (3.483, 3.699, and 3.983 Å for NiCl2, NiBr2, and NiI2, respectively), suggesting
very weak interlayer interactions between vdW layers.

In NiX2 monolayers,
because of the octahedral crystal
field caused by the ligands, the Ni d orbitals split into two parts,
namely, the lower t2g and the higher eg manifolds.
Each Ni gives two electrons to form ionic bonding with the ligands
and leaves eight electrons, which fully occupy the t2g orbitals
and the spin-up eg orbitals, and the spin-down eg orbitals are empty. Thus, the Ni2+ ion shows an occupation
state of d8 with a magnetic moment of ∼2 μB. A sizable electronic band gap is expected to be opened by
the crystal field. To determine the magnetic ground state of monolayer
NiX2, we carry out spin-polarized calculations. Two different
magnetic configurations are considered in a 2 × 1 super cell,
that is, the FM state and antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. The spin
densities for these two states are shown in Figure 2a,b. The spin polarizations are mainly contributed
by Ni ions, while the ligands are slightly spin-polarized. The projected
magnetic moment on each Ni ion is nearly the same for FM and AFM states.
The numerical results are listed in Table 2. It is found that the FM states for NiCl2, NiBr2, and NiI2 monolayers are lower
in energy than the corresponding AFM states by 11.2, 12.6, and 15.4
meV per unit cell, respectively, suggesting that the ground states
are FM; this is consistent with recent studies reported by Mounet
et al.26

It is known that the
results from GGA + U calculations for a magnetic
system sometimes may depend on the adopted value of effective Hubbard U (Ueff). Thus, to verify our
result, we repeat the GGA + U calculations with Ueff = 2–5 eV for Ni d orbitals for the NiI2 monolayer. The ground state remains FM with exchange energy
ranging from 12 to 23 meV. Thus, the predicted ferromagnetism in NiI2 is robust against the value of Hubbard U.

Figure 3 shows
the
electronic structures of FM ground states for NiX2 monolayers.
Here, we focus on the results calculated by the PBE + U method. The
effect of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can be further elucidated by comparing
the electronic band structure, as shown in Figure 3. It is found that all the three systems
are semiconductors with indirect band gaps of 2.60, 1.97, and 1.24
eV for NiCl2, NiBr2, and NiI2, respectively,
consistent with our above analysis. The decrease in band gap from
NiCl2 to NiI2 is due to the decrease in strength
of the crystal field, which is inversely proportional to the Ni–X
bond length. Interestingly, the value of exchange energy increases
from NiCl2 to NiI2. This may be caused by two
factors: (i) The reduction of energy gap between t2g and
eg orbitals will strengthen the t2g–eg virtual exchange interaction, benefiting the FM coupling,
which has been carefully discussed in our previous work.27 (ii) I has a smaller electronegativity than
Cl, namely, the on-site energy of I p orbitals is closer to that of
Ni d orbitals than the Cl p orbitals do. Thus, the d–p–d
superexchange in NiI2 is stronger than that in NiCl2, which can be confirmed by comparing the PDOS between NiI2 and NiCl2, where the broadening of Ni d orbitals
in energy for NiI2 is larger than that for NiCl2. Similar phenomena are also found in previous studies on transition
metal halides monolayers such as CrX328 and VX3.29 After
considering SOC, there is no noticeable change in the electronic band
structure, as shown in Figure 3, with the indirect band gaps of 2.57, 1.82, and 1.03 eV for
NiCl2, NiBr2, and NiI2, respectively.

For practical spintronic applications of 2D FM semiconductors,
it is necessary to investigate the magnetic behavior under finite
temperature. The Ising model has been widely used to describe the
magnetic coupling in 2D magnetic systems.17,30−32 Here, we also use the Ising model including nearest-neighboring
exchange interactions to study the magnetic behavior of NiX2 (X = Cl, Br, I) monolayers. The spin Hamiltonian  where the summation i runs
over all Ni sites, j runs over the six nearest neighbors
of site i. Jij is the
nearest-neighboring exchange parameter. Then, we performed Metropolis
Monte Carlo simulations33,34 to estimate the TC. A 30 × 30 hexagonal superlattice containing
900 magnetic sites and the periodic boundary condition is used. The
average magnetization per formula unit and the specific heat [Cv = (⟨E2⟩
– ⟨E⟩2)/kBT2] are taken after the system
reaches the equilibrium state at a given temperature (Figure 4). The TC can also be extracted from the peak of the specific heat
profile.35 The estimated TC values for NiX2 (X = Cl, Br, I) monolayers
are 120, 140, and 170 K, respectively, which are much larger than
the reported values for 2D CrI3 (∼45 K)8 and Cr2Ge2Te6 (∼30 K)7 and are higher than the
liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K).

for the NiCl2, NiBr2, and NiI2 monolayers;
the inset shows the corresponding magnetization.

For practical uses, a 2D material usually needs to be supported
by a suitable substrate, which may apply an in-plane strain and affect
the performance of the pristine material. Thus, it is necessary to
investigate the magnetic and electronic properties of NiX2 monolayers under a proper in-plane strain. Here, we focus on NiI2 because it has the highest TC among the three systems. The applied biaxial in-plane strain is
defined as ε = (a – a0)/a0 × 100%, where a0 and a are the lattice constants
of 2D NiI2 in its equilibrium and strained states, respectively.
Positive and negative values of ε represent tensile and compressive
strain, respectively. As shown in Figure 5a, a tensile strain will reduce the exchange
energy. This is opposite to previous studies on CrI328 and CrGeTe350 where the exchange energy is increased by a tensile strain.
It can be understood that the Cr3+ ion in CrI3 and CrGeTe3 has a d3 occupation state, which
is less than half-filled. In this case, the AFM direct exchange mainly
contributed by the t2g–t2g hybridizations,
which can be fairly reduced by a tensile in-plane strain that increases
the distance between neighboring Cr3+ ions. Thus, a proper
tensile in-plane strain can enhance the FM couplings in CrI3 and CrGeTe3. But in NiI2, the occupation state
of Ni2+ (d8) is more than half-filled. In this
case, the AFM direct exchange originates from eg–eg hybridizations, which is usually much weaker than the t2g–t2g hybridizations and is not sensitive
to a tensile strain, while the tensile strain reduces the d–p
exchange interactions, weakening the FM couplings between adjacent
Ni2+ ions. When applying a compressive strain, the exchange
energy decreases. This is mainly because a compressive strain will
strengthen the crystal field, increasing the energy gap between t2g and eg orbitals (Figure 5c) and weakening the FM t2g–eg virtual exchange interactions. The indirect band gaps of
NiI2 under −4 and 4% strain are 0.90 and 1.43 eV,
respectively. Overall, the electronic and magnetic properties of NiI2 only slightly change under a moderate in-plane strain, which
makes it a robust 2D FM semiconductor. PBE functional is known to
usually underestimate the band gap; thus, we also repeat our calculation
using HSE06 hybrid functional for NiI2 monolayer. The band
structure of NiI2 calculated by HSE06 functional is also
shown in Figure 5b,
with an indirect band gap of 2.31 eV nearly twice as large as the
one (1.24 eV) calculated by the PBE + U method. Also, the ground state
is also FM with an exchange energy of 19.5 meV, which is a bit larger
than the PBE + U result (15.4 meV).

Janus 2D materials with breaking
mirror or inversion symmetry along
out-of-plane orientations provide abundant new properties such as
electric polarization and Rashba effect, which expands the promising
applications of 2D materials.36−38 Thus, it will be interesting
to explore the properties of the Janus NiXY monolayer. Here, we calculated
the NiICl monolayer. The calculated lattice constant is 3.74 Å,
which is between those of NiI2 and NiCl2. The
breaking of inversion symmetry can be seen from the optimized structure
(Figure 6a). This induces
a vertical electric polarization of 0.19 C/m2, making NiICl
a 2D multiferroic material. The magnetic ground state is also FM for
NiICl, with an exchange energy of 9.3 meV. Interestingly, because
of out-of-plane electric polarization, the response of magnetic coupling
to a vertical external electric field also exhibits a “polar”
behavior; that is, an electric field along the +z direction will enhance the FM coupling, while an electric field
along the −z direction will weaken it (Figure 6b). On the other
hand, the electronic structure of NiICl does not change much compared
to that of the NiI2 monolayer (Figure 6c).

views of crystal
structure of NiICl. (b) Change of exchange energy with respect to
electric field. (c) Band structure of NiICl. The red and purple lines
represent the spin-up and spin-down bands, respectively.

On the other hand, 2D magnetic materials are usually
used as a
building block of vdW heterostructures and junctions to realize a
highly functional nanodevice. For instance, the recently discovered
2D FM semiconductor CrI3 shows AFM interlayer magnetic
couplings in bilayer CrI3. This unusual property has attracted
much attention. Thus, it is also important to explore the interlayer
interactions between NiX2 layers. Here, AA- and AB-stacked
bilayers of NiCl2, NiBr2, and NiI2 are considered in our calculations. The AB-stacked bilayers are
more favored than the AA-stacked ones with total energy values lower
by 0.001, 0.001, and 0.002 eV for NiCl2, NiBr2, and NiI2, respectively. The lattice constants a0 of AB-stacked bilayers NiCl2, NiBr2, and NiI2 are 3.49, 3.70, and 4.01 Å, which
are very close to their bulks, suggesting weak vdW interlayer interactions
between layers.

For the magnetic coupling in such bilayer systems,
two different
magnetic configurations are considered, that is, the FM state and
the interlayer-antiferromagnetic (I-AFM, where Ni ions in one layer
possess spin-up magnetic moment and, in the other layer, possess spin-down
magnetic moment) state. We find that the FM states are lower in energy
than the I-AFM states. But the energy differences between FM and I-AFM
states are very small, which are 0.27, 0.65, and 2.20 meV for AB stacking
(0.17, 0.47, and 1.42 meV for AA stacking), suggesting that the magnetic
coupling between NiX2 layers can be easily tuned by external
perturbations.

Conclusions
In summary, on the basis
of first-principles calculations, we propose
a class of 2D FM semiconductors, the NiX2 (X = Cl, Br,
I) monolayers by exfoliation from corresponding vdW bulk materials.
The calculated cleavage energy of bulk NiX2 (X = Cl, Br,
I) is slightly smaller than that of graphite, indicating that exfoliation
is possible in the experiment by mechanical cleavage or liquid exfoliation.
Meanwhile, the calculated in-plane stiffness implies that the 2D NiX2 (X = Cl, Br, I) monolayers can keep their free-standing structures
without curling or buckling. All three monolayers are semiconducting
with band gaps of 2.60, 1.97, and 1.24 eV for NiCl2, NiBr2, and NiI2, respectively. The ground states of
the monolayers are FM with TC values ranging
from 120 to 170 K. The TC increases from
NiCl2 to NiBr2 and NiI2 due to enhanced
p–d exchange interactions and t2g–eg virtual exchange interactions. Different from the usual case of
tensile strain-induced enhancement of ferromagnetism in systems such
as CrI3 and CrGeTe3, FM couplings in NiI2 are slightly decreased by both tensile and compressive strain
due to its more than half-filled occupation state. Besides, for the
Janus monolayer, we found that the spin interaction shows a very strong
magnetoelectric coupling. Furthermore, for the bilayer of NiX2, our results show that the interlayer coupling is quite weak,
indicating the possibility of tuning the magnetic coupling through
external manipulations. Our findings suggest that NiX2 (X
= Cl, Br, I) layers can have promising applications in spintronic
devices such as spin valves, information transport, and storage between
electric signals and spin signals. We hope that the present study
will stimulate further experimental effort on this subject.

Computational
Methods
The first-principles calculations based on spin-polarized
density
functional theory (DFT) are performed using the projected augmented
plane-wave (PAW)39 method as implemented
in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).40 Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) given by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) was adopted for exchange–correlation functionals.41 Considering the strongly correlated electrons
in the partially filled d subshells, we use the GGA + U method introduced
by Dudarev et al.42 with Ueff = 4 eV for Ni d orbitals. The electronic wave functions
are expanded using a plane-wave basis set with a cutoff energy of
500 eV. For 2D monolayer system, a vacuum space of 20 Å along
the z direction is adopted to avoid interactions
between two neighboring images. The Γ-centered Monkhorst–Pack43−45 point scheme with 8 × 8 × 1 and 4 × 8 × 1 grid
meshes is used to sample the reciprocal space of the primitive cell
and the 2 × 1 super cell, respectively. For the bulk crystals,
the DFT-D3 method by Grimme46 is used to
account for the weak vdW interactions between different layers. During
the optimization, both the lattice constants and positions of all
atoms are relaxed without any symmetry restriction until the Hellmann–Feynman
force on each atom is less than 0.01 eV Å–1. The convergent criterion for the total energy is set as 1 ×
10–5 eV.
