The
mechanism of Ni-catalyzed ortho C(sp2)–H
oxidative cycloaddition of aromatic amides with internal
alkynes containing 2-pyridinylmethylamine directing group was investigated
using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The C–H
cleavage step proceeds via σ-complex-assisted metathesis (σ-CAM)
with an alkenyl-Ni(II) complex. This is in contrast to the more common
carboxylate/carbonate-assisted concerted metalation–deprotonation
mechanism in related Ni-catalyzed C–H bond functionalization
reactions with N,N-bidentate directing
groups. In this reaction, the alkyne not only serves as the coupling
partner, but also facilitates the σ-CAM C–H metalation
both kinetically and thermodynamically. The subsequent functionalization
of the five-membered nickelacycle proceeds via alkyne insertion into
the Ni–C bond to form a seven-membered nickelacycle. This process
proceeds with high levels of regioselectivity to form a C–C
bond with sterically more encumbered alkyne terminus. This unusual
regioselectivity is due to steric repulsions with the directing group
that is coplanar with the alkyne in the migratory insertion transition
state. The C–N bond reductive elimination to form the isoquinolone
cycloadduct is promoted by PPh3 complexation to the Ni
center and the use of flexible 2-pyridinylmethylamine directing group.
The origin of the cis–trans isomerism of alkene byproduct was
also explained by computations.

1 Introduction
Functionalization
of C–H bonds to construct new C–C
and C–heteroatom bonds using transition-metal catalysts is
a powerful, step- and atom-economical strategy in organic synthesis.1 First introduced by Daugulis et al.,2N,N-bidentate
directing groups are now widely used to facilitate site-selective
C–H bond functionalizations using a variety of transition metals,
including Pd, Ni, Ru, Rh, Co, and Cu, as catalysts (Scheme 1).3,4 The
C–H cleavage step in these reactions is most commonly proposed
to proceed via a base-promoted concerted metalation–deprotonation
(CMD) mechanism.5 Although other C–H
bond metalation pathways, such as oxidative addition (OA),6 σ-complex-assisted metathesis (σ-CAM),7 and ligand-to-ligand hydrogen transfer,8 are well precedented in the literature, these
alternative mechanisms have not been thoroughly investigated in C–H
functionalization reactions involving N,N-bidentate directing groups.9 Because
previous computational mechanistic studies of this type of reactions
all focused on the CMD mechanism,10,11 it is not
clear what conditions would promote an alternative C–H bond
cleavage pathway. In addition, factors that control the reactivity
of these alternative C–H cleavage pathways have not been investigated
computationally.

Scheme 1 Mechanisms of Transition-Metal-Catalyzed C–H
Functionalization
of Amides Using N,N-Bidentate Directing
Groups
In this manuscript, we report
a computational study of the Ni-catalyzed
oxidative cycloaddition of aromatic amides and alkynes via C(sp2)–H functionalization assisted by a 2-pyridinylmethylamine
directing group (Scheme 2a).12,13 In contrast to the C–H functionalization
of similar aromatic and aliphatic amides with other coupling partners,14−18 this oxidative cycloaddition is mechanistically distinct in several
aspects. First, unlike the majority of Ni-catalyzed C–H functionalization
reactions, which often employs a Ni(II) precatalyst and under conditions
with bases (e.g., acetates, carbonates, etc.), this reaction involves
a Ni(0) catalyst in the absence of a base. Chatani et al. proposed
a unique C–H metalation mechanism via an alkenyl-Ni(II) complex
formed from insertion of an alkyne to a nickel(II)-hydride.12,19 It is surmised that the electron-deficient Ni(II) center would coordinate
to the ortho C–H bond to form a σ-complex,
which then undergoes σ-complex-assisted metathesis (σ-CAM)
of the ortho C–H bond with the Ni–alkenyl
bond via a four-membered cyclic transition state (path b, Scheme 1). Second, this oxidative
cycloaddition forms the isoquinolone cycloadduct, while reactions
of similar substrates with alkynes under different reaction conditions
(e.g., in the presence of a base or with O2 as oxidant)
lead to acyclic alkenylation or alkynation products (Scheme 2b,c).20 These reactions are expected to involve similar Ni(II) metalacycle
intermediates regardless of the C–H metalation mechanism (Scheme 1). Factors that determine
the chemoselectivity of cyclic versus acyclic products are still not
clear. Finally, this oxidative cycloaddition uses alkyne as a mild
oxidant,9,21 which is unusual in oxidative C–H
functionalization reactions. In most of the oxidative C–H functionalization
reactions,22−25 the oxidant is not directly involved in the C–H metalation
step. In contrast, it has been proposed that the alkyne promotes the
reactivity of the C–H metalation step of this reaction.12 Therefore, the role of the alkyne oxidant warrants
an in-depth investigation.

Scheme 2 Ni-Catalyzed C–H Functionalization
of Amides with Alkynes
Using N,N-Bidentate Directing Groups
To address these mechanistic
ambiguities, we performed density
functional theory calculations to investigate the reaction mechanisms
of the Ni-catalyzed ortho C(sp2)–H
oxidative cycloaddition reaction with alkynes. We provide a detailed
analysis of the mechanisms of the C–H metalation step and the
role of alkyne in facilitating the C–H metalation. The effects
of phosphine additives and 2-pyridinylmethylamine directing group
on reactivity and chemoselectivity for the isoquinolone cycloaddition
products are carefully analyzed. In addition, the origins of the experimentally
observed regioselectivity with unsymmetrically internal aryl alkynes
and the formation of trans-alkene byproducts are
also rationalized.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Proposed Reaction Mechanisms
The
proposed mechanisms of the Ni-catalyzed ortho C(sp2)–H oxidative cycloaddition of aromatic amide 1 with model substrate 2-butyne 2 to afford the
isoquinolone cycloaddition product 3 are provided in Scheme 3. With the low-valence
Ni(0) precatalyst, coordination of the N,N-bidentate directing group most likely occurs via an oxidative
addition of the amide N–H bond to form a Ni(II)-hydride (10) rather than through a base-promoted N–H deprotonation.26,27 The ortho C–H bond in 10 is
expected to yield an agostic interaction with the Ni due to its proximity
to the electron-deficient metal center. From 10, two
different C–H metalation pathways are possible. The σ-complex-assisted
metathesis (σ-CAM) of the ortho C–H
bond with the Ni–H bond in 10 will afford the
H2-bound nickelacycle 11.28 Alternatively, alkyne insertion into the Ni–H bond
in 10 will form an alkenyl-Ni(II) complex 8,29 which then undergoes a σ-CAM
with the Ni–alkenyl bond to give the alkene-bound nickelacycle 9. Ligand exchange of the H2 or alkene in intermediate 11 or 9 with an alkyne yields complex 13. Subsequent alkyne migratory insertion into the Ni–C(sp2) bond in 13 forms a seven-membered nickelacycle,
which upon C–N bond reductive elimination gives the isoquinolone
product 3 and regenerates the Ni(0) catalyst. As discussed
in Introduction, because such σ-CAM
pathways have not been investigated computationally, a few important
mechanistic questions still remain. These include: (a) the preference
of the two competing σ-CAM pathways from either the nickel hydride 10 or the alkenyl nickel complex 8; (b) factors
that promote the C–N bond reductive elimination to form the
cycloaddition product; (c) factors that promote alkyne insertion into
the nickelacycle 13 over the direct alkene migratory
insertion from 9; (d) origins of regioselectivity with
unsymmetrical internal alkynes; and (e) the mechanism to form the trans-alkene byproduct. These questions are discussed in
detail in the following sections.

2.2 Mechanisms
of the Ortho C(sp2)–H Metalation
Step and the Role of Alkyne as a Hydrogen
Acceptor
The computed reaction energy profiles for steps
leading to the C–H metalated nickelacycle 9 are
shown in Figure 1a.
Optimized geometries of select transition states and intermediates
are shown in Figure 1b. The catalytic cycle begins with ligand exchange to replace the
cod ligands in the Ni(cod)2 precatalyst with PPh3 and amide 1 to form complex 4. Under the
experimental conditions of 10 mol % Ni(cod)2, 40 mol %
PPh3 ligand, and three or more equivalents of internal
alkyne, cod, PPh3, or the internal alkyne can potentially
bind to the Ni center prior to the amide N–H oxidative addition.30 The N–H oxidative addition pathways involving
these ancillary ligands were considered computationally (see the Supporting Information for details). Our calculations
indicate that the most favorable amide N–H oxidative addition
pathway involves binding of two PPh3 ligands (TS1). Facilitated by the strong donor ligands (PPh3 and pyridine),
this N–H oxidative addition process has an activation barrier
of 28.0 kcal/mol with respect to 1 and Ni(cod)2. In the absence of PPh3, the N–H oxidative addition
requires a barrier that is about 5 kcal/mol higher than that of TS1 (see the Supporting Information for details).

structures of σ-C–H complexes and σ-CAM transition
states with select bond distances shown in Å. All energies are
with respect to the separate reactants and Ni(cod)2.

From the Ni(II)-hydride intermediate 5, two different
σ-CAM pathways are possible. Dissociation of the PPh3 ligand forms σ-complex 10, which has a strong
agostic interaction between the ortho C–H
bond and the Ni.31 This agostic interaction
slightly elongates the ortho C–H bond to 1.11
Å compared to 1.09 Å for the same bond in 5. Formation of the σ-complex promotes the σ-bond metathesis
of the ortho C–H bond with the Ni–H
bond via a four-membered cyclic σ-CAM transition state TS4.32 The four-membered cycle
in TS4 is completely planar, which makes the benzene
ring coplanar with the 2-pyridinylmethylamine directing group, resembling
the planar geometry of the forming nickelacycle intermediate 11. TS4 is only 9.2 kcal/mol higher in energy
than the σ-complex 10. However, because the formation
of the Ni(II)-hydride σ-complex 10 is highly endergonic
(27.1 kcal/mol with respect to amide 1 and the Ni(cod)2 catalyst), the overall activation free energy of this σ-CAM
pathway is relatively high (ΔG‡ = 36.3 kcal/mol). An alternative σ-CAM pathway from complex 5 involves a ligand exchange to replace the PPh3 ligand with an alkyne to form π-alkyne complex 6, which then undergoes facile alkyne migratory insertion (TS2) into the Ni–H bond and forms alkenyl-Ni(II) complex 8.33 An agostic interaction with
the ortho C–H bond was also observed in σ-complex 8, although the distance between the C–H bond and the
Ni is slightly longer than that in 10 due to the larger
size of the alkenyl group compared to the hydride ligand. From 8, the C–H metalation occurs via σ-CAM transition
state TS3, which requires a low activation barrier of
10.8 kcal/mol with respect to 8 to form the alkene-bound
five-membered nickelacycle 9.34 Similar to the planar geometry of TS4, the four-membered
cycle in TS3 is also coplanar with the bidentate directing
group. The alkenyl group is perpendicular to the plane. Therefore,
no significant steric repulsions are observed between the alkenyl
group and the directing group in the σ-CAM transition state.
Overall, TS3 is much more stable than TS4 because of the greater stability of the alkenyl-Ni(II) complex 8 compared to the Ni(II)-hydride 10. As such,
the σ-CAM occurs via the alkenyl-Ni(II) complex 8 rather than from the Ni(II)-hydride 10, consistent
with the mechanism proposed by Chatani.12 Here, the alkyne plays an important role in promoting the C–H
metalation via σ-CAM. Although the initial N–H oxidative
addition to form the Ni(II)-hydride is kinetically feasible, this
process is thermodynamically uphill. In the presence of alkyne, the
Ni(II)-hydride intermediate is converted to a thermodynamically more
stable alkenyl-Ni(II) complex via alkyne migratory insertion. Due
to the thermodynamic stability of the alkenyl-Ni(II) complex, this
σ-CAM pathway now requires a much lower overall activation barrier.
As the H2 acceptor, the alkyne also provides thermodynamic
driving force for the C–H metalation. While the formation of
the cis-2-butene-bound nickelacycle 9 is exergonic, the corresponding C–H metalation process in
the absence of alkyne to form the H2-bound nickelacycle 11 is endergonic by 24.8 kcal/mol with respect to the reactants
(1, alkyne, and Ni(cod)2). Taken together,
the alkyne serves multiple roles in promoting the C–H metalation
both kinetically and thermodynamically.35

2.3 Mechanisms of Ni–C Insertion and C–N
Bond Formation Steps and the Effects of Phosphine Additives and the
2-Pyridinylmethylamine Directing Group
We next investigated
the mechanisms of the reaction of the nickelacycle intermediate 9 with alkyne to form the experimentally observed isoquinolone
product and a few competing pathways to the experimentally unobserved
products (Figure 2).
From the alkene-bound nickelacycle 9, ligand exchange
with another molecule of alkyne forms π-alkyne complex 13, which is 7.8 kcal/mol more stable than 9.
The alkyne migratory insertion to the Ni–C bond in 13 forms a seven-membered nickelacycle 14 via transition
state TS5. This process is more favorable than the alkene
migratory insertion from 9 (via TS8). Here, TS5 is stabilized by the backdonation of the Ni d electrons
to the π* of the alkyne, which is not present in TS8.36 From 14, the C–N
bond reductive elimination is promoted by coordination of a PPh3 ligand to form a four-coordinated Ni(II) complex 15. From 15, the C–N bond reductive elimination
(TS6) requires only 13.7 kcal/mol to form the isoquinolone-bound
Ni(0) complex 16. On the other hand, reductive elimination
from complex 14 without phosphine coordination requires
a much higher activation barrier of 24.2 kcal/mol (TS7) with respect to 14.

and Ni(cod)2.

Experimentally, the Ni-catalyzed ortho C(sp2)–H oxidative cycloaddition reaction is the most effective
with 2-pyridinylmethylamine directing group.12 Although several different N,N-bidentate directing groups, such as 2-pyridinylmethylamine, 8-aminoquinoline,
and 2-(pyridin-2-yl)isopropyl amine, have been used experimentally
for related transformations, a thorough understanding of potential
directing group effects in these reactions is still lacking.10a,10b We surmised that the flexible directing group in 1 may
facilitate the C–N bond reductive elimination to form the cyclic
isoquinolone product. We performed calculations with model substrate 19 containing a more rigid 8-aminoquinoline moiety to explore
the flexibility effect of the directing group. In reaction with 19, the C–N bond reductive elimination (TS9) requires an activation barrier of 18.9 kcal/mol with respect to
the seven-membered nickelacycle 20 (Figure 3), which is more than 6 kcal/mol
higher than the corresponding C–N bond reductive elimination
using the 2-pyridinylmethylamine directing group (TS6). In TS6, the five-membered N,N-chelate adapts an envelope conformation in which the sp3 carbon (C1) is puckered out of plane. This allows the forming
C–N bond to be coplanar with the pyridine N and the PPh3 ligand such that the Ni(II) center can adopt a less-distorted
square planar geometry. On the other hand, the rigid 8-aminoquinoline
directing group leads to greater distortion of the fused rings in TS9 that makes the C–N bond reductive elimination less
effective.37

elimination transition states with select bond distances in angstrom
(Å) and bond angles shown in degree. All energies are with respect
to the phosphine-bound seven-membered nickelacycles 15 and 20.

In summary, the most favorable mechanism in the Ni-catalyzed ortho C(sp2)–H oxidative cycloaddition
of aromatic amide 1 and internal alkyne 2 proceeds by oxidative addition into the amide N–H bond to
form Ni(II)-hydride 5, followed by alkyne insertion to
form an alkenyl-Ni(II) complex 8. The agostic interaction
with the ortho C–H bond in the σ-complex 8 promotes C–H metalation via a σ-CAM mechanism
to afford alkene-bound five-membered nickelacycle. Insertion of another
alkyne molecule and phosphine-promoted C–N reductive elimination
afford the isoquinolone product and regenerate the Ni(0) catalyst.

2.4 Origin of Regioselectivity with Unsymmetrical
Internal Aryl Alkynes
We next investigated the origin of
the high levels of regioselectivity in reactions with unsymmetrical
internal alkynes. When phenylalkylacetylenes are used as coupling
partners, this oxidative cycloaddition reaction tolerates bulky alkyl
substituents, such as tert-butyl, on the alkyne (Scheme 4). Interestingly,
the major regioisomeric pathway involves formation of a new C–C
bond with the more sterically demanding alkyne terminus. In addition,
a greater regioselectivity was observed when the size of the alkyl
group increased from methyl to tert-butyl. To investigate
the origin of this “counter-steric” regioselectivity,
we calculated the regioselectivity-determining alkyne insertion pathways
with phenylalkylacetylenes 23 and 24 (Table 1).

free energy and enthalpy of
activation in the alkyne insertion step. All energies are in kcal/mol
with respect to the alkyne-bound nickelacycle C.

In the reaction with 1-phenyl-1-propyne
(23, R = Me),
the alkyne insertion transition state (TS-10A) leading
to the major regioisomer A is preferred by 1.6 kcal/mol,
in good agreement with experimental regioselectivity (entry 1). The
origin of this preference is attributed to the stabilization of the
partial negative charge on the α-carbon of the forming Ni–C
bond by the terminal phenyl group in TS-10A.38 In the reaction with phenyl-t-butylacetylene (24, R = t-Bu), the
major regioisomeric transition state TS-11A is stabilized
by a similar electronic effect. TS-11A and TS-10A have almost identical activation barriers with respect to the corresponding
π-alkyne complexes. Therefore, the reactivity of this migratory
insertion is not sensitive to the steric bulk of the terminal alkyne
substituent (R) adjacent to the forming C–C bond. The four-membered
cyclic alkyne migration transition states TS-11A and TS-10A are not planar; the alkyl group (R) on the alkyne points
out of the plane of the nickelacycle (Figure 4). As such, the steric repulsions between
R and the nickelacycle in both transition states are diminished. On
the other hand, in the minor regioisomeric transition state TS-11B, the bulky tert-Bu substituent is
placed coplanar with the nickelacycle to achieve a square planar geometry
of Ni(II). As such, substantial steric repulsions between the tert-Bu and the 2-pyridinylmethylamine directing group are
observed in TS-11B. This steric effect makes the tert-Bu-substituted TS-11B 1.5 kcal/mol less
stable than the Me-substituted TS-10B and thus leads
to an increased regioselectivity (ΔΔG‡ = 3.8 kcal/mol) when phenyl-t-butylacetylene (24) was used as the coupling partner.

alkyne 23 and (b) alkyne 24.

2.5 Mechanism of Cis–Trans
Isomerization
of the Alkene Byproduct
In the Ni-catalyzed C–H bond
functionalization of amide 1 with diphenylacetylene, trans-stilbene was produced in 81% yield.12 The alkyne-promoted σ-CAM process discussed above
forms cis-alkenes rather than the trans-isomers. As such, a cis-to-trans alkene isomerization must be operational.
Because nickel hydride complexes are known to catalyze alkene isomerization
reactions,27a we surmised that Ni(II)-hydride
intermediate 5 in the main catalytic cycle may serve
as a catalyst to promote the cis–trans isomerization. The reaction
energy profile of this pathway was calculated (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Reaction energy profile of the Ni(II)-hydride-catalyzed
isomerization
of cis-2-butene to trans-2-butene.
All energies are with respect to the Ni(II)-hydride complex 5 and cis-2-butene.

Ligand exchange of PPh3 in Ni(II)-hydride 5 with cis-2-butene forms complex 25, which then undergoes alkene migratory insertion to form β-agostic
alkyl-Ni(II) complex 27.39 From 27, β-hydride elimination with a different
C–H bond forms the trans-2-butene-bound Ni(II)-hydride 28, which upon ligand exchange with PPh3 extrudes
the trans-2-butene byproduct. The cis–trans
isomerization process in this off-cycle pathway is kinetically feasible
and thermodynamically exergonic by 0.9 kcal/mol. The presence of PPh3 ligand does not significantly inhibit the reaction because
the ligand exchange of PPh3 with alkene is only uphill
by about 11 kcal/mol. In addition, coordination to a PPh3 ligand to form 26 does not stabilize the alkyl-Ni(II)
intermediate 27. Taken together, the computed reaction
energy profile indicates that the Ni(II)-hydride intermediate 5 is a competent catalyst for the isomerization of cis-alkenes to the experimentally observed trans-alkene byproducts. These results further support the formation of
Ni(II)-hydride complex in the main catalytic cycle.

3 Conclusions
The reaction mechanism of Ni-catalyzed ortho C(sp2)–H oxidative cycloaddition
of aromatic amides with
internal alkynes containing 2-pyridinylmethylamine directing group
was investigated using DFT calculations. The catalytic cycle begins
by oxidative addition of the amide N–H bond to form a Ni(II)-hydride
complex. The subsequent C–H metalation process occurs via a
unique σ-complex-assisted metathesis (σ-CAM) mechanism
where the internal alkyne acts as a hydrogen acceptor. This contrasts
with the CMD mechanism that is usually involved in the Ni-catalyzed
C–H metalation in the presence of carboxylate or carbonate
bases. The alkyne plays significant roles in promoting the σ-CAM
pathway both thermodynamically as a H2 acceptor and kinetically.
Because the Ni(II)-hydride intermediate is thermodynamically unstable,
σ-CAM from the Ni(II)-hydride requires a high overall barrier.
On the other hand, in the presence of the alkyne, the Ni(II)-hydride
is converted to a more stable alkenyl-Ni(II) species, which then undergoes
more facile σ-CAM.

The subsequent reaction with the alkene-bound
nickelacycle proceeds
via an exergonic ligand exchange with another molecule of alkyne,
followed by alkyne insertion to form a seven-membered nickelacycle.
The insertion of the alkene is less favorable. The alkyne migratory
insertion occurs via a nonplanar four-membered cyclic transition state,
in which the steric repulsion about the forming C–C bond is
diminished. As such, this reaction tolerates alkynes with very bulky
terminus and offers high regioselectivity to form the sterically more
encumbered C–C bond. The C–N bond reductive elimination
of the seven-membered nickelacycle is a key step to form the cyclic
isoquinolone products. This C–N bond reductive elimination
is promoted by a PPh3 ligand and the flexible 2-pyridinylmethylamine
directing group, which reduces the strain of the fused cyclic system
in the reductive elimination transition state. The cis–trans
isomerism of the alkene byproduct was also explored computationally.
This process is catalyzed by a Ni(II)-hydride intermediate in the
main catalytic cycle.

We expect that the mechanistic insights
from this study, in particular,
the unique roles of alkynes to promote the σ-CAM pathway, will
aid in the development of other transition-metal-catalyzed C–H
functionalization reactions with alkynes.

Methods
All calculations were performed using Gaussian 09.40 Images of the 3D structures of molecules were
generated
using CYLview.41 Geometry optimizations
and vibrational frequency calculations were performed using the B3LYP42 functional in gas phase with the LANL2DZ effective
core potential basis set for nickel and the 6-31G(d) basis set for
other atoms. The nature of all stationary points was confirmed by
the number of imaginary frequencies. All minima have zero imaginary
frequency, and all transition states have only one imaginary frequency.
IRC calculations were carried out for alkene and alkyne insertion
transition states and for σ-CAM transition states to confirm
that the transition state structures connected to the appropriate
intermediates. Single-point energy calculations were carried out using
the M0643 functional and the SDD basis
set for Ni and 6-311+G(d,p) for other atoms. The SMD44 solvation model was used in the single-point energy calculations
to incorporate solvent effects with toluene as the solvent. Thermal
corrections to the Gibbs free energies and enthalpies were calculated
using the harmonic oscillator approximation at 298.15 K.

In the presence of a strong
base, such as t-BuOK, N–H deprotonation would
form a nickel(0)
ate complex. A recent computational study indicates the subsequent
C–H metalation from the nickel(0) ate complex occurs via a
ligand-to-ligand hydrogen transfer mechanism. See ref (8c).

An alternative pathway involving oxidative
addition of ortho C(sp2)–H bond with the Ni(0) catalyst was considered computationally.
The barrier of the C–H oxidative addition is 19.5 kcal/mol
with respect to amide 1 and Ni(cod)2. However,
the subsequent steps in this pathway were highly disfavored. Both
alkyne insertion into Ni–H bond and N–H deprotonation
to form the five-membered Ni(II) metallacycle 9 require
very high activation barriers of 44.5 and 67.2 kcal/mol with respect
to 1 and Ni(cod)2, respectively. Based on
these results, this oxidative addition pathway was ruled out (see Supporting Information for more details).

An alternatively pathway
to form intermediate 11 from phosphine-bound Ni(II)-hydride
complex 5 via σ-bond metathesis followed by PPh3 decomplexation
requires a much higher barrier (66.0 kcal/mol with respect to aromatic
amide 1 and Ni(cod)2 catalyst). This very
high barrier is due to the absence of an agostic interaction and unfavorable
steric effects of the additional PPh3 ligand.


PPh3 coordination to intermediate 8 forms an off-cycle phosphine-bound alkenyl-Ni(II) complex 7. Complex 7 is 11.2 kcal/mol more stable than 8.


a Another
mechanism for C–H metalation involves σ-bond metathesis
of the Ni–N bond in intermediate 8 with the ortho C–H bond to form a five-membered alkenyl-nickelacycle
(see Supporting Information for details).
This process requires an activation barrier of 39 kcal/mol with respect
to the separate reactants and Ni(cod)2, and thus can be
ruled out.

b In our calculations, we could not locate neither the transition
state structure for the oxidative addition of the ortho C(sp2)–H bond from alkenyl-Ni(II) complex 8 nor the resulting Ni(IV)-hydride complex. All attempts to
locate these structures resulted in TS3, 8, or 9. Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations were carried
out for TS3 to confirm that it connects to complexes 8 and 9.


We also computationally considered the use
of cis-2-butene rather than 2-butyne as the H2 acceptor to promote the C–H metalation. In this alternatively
pathway, the barrier of σ-bond metathesis is 34.8 kcal/mol with
respect to the separate reactants and Ni(cod)2, and thus
this pathway is less favorable than that using alkyne as H2 acceptor (see Supporting Information for
details).
