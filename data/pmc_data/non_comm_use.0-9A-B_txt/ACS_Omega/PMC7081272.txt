Isonitriles
are frequently employed as both substrates for organic
transformations and ligands for organometallic chemistry. However,
despite the wide application of the isonitriles, their synthesis generally
depends on the traditional dehydration of N-formamide.
“Nucleophilic isocyanation” using cyanide as an N-nucleophile is another straightforward strategy affording
the corresponding isonitriles. This method has been available since
the 19th century but is still an immature procedure and is therefore
more rarely used. In this review, we summarize the concepts and recent
progress in nucleophilic isocyanation, including the relatively rare
examples of catalytic isocyanation.

1 Introduction
Isonitrile (A: R–NC) is a regioisomer of the
corresponding nitrile (R–CN) (Figure 1). The structure of C–NC is almost
linear. The bond length of the isocyano group (−NC) is slightly
longer than that of the cyano group (−CN) because of a postulating
contribution of resonance structure B. For example, the
NC bond length of methyl isonitrile (MeNC) is reported to be 116.7
pm, while the CN bond length of acetonitrile (MeCN) is 115.8 pm.1 Isonitriles are well-known surrogates of carbon
monoxide in organometallic chemistry, whose C termini show carbene-like
reactivity (structure B in Figure 1). These compounds are also regarded as unique
and important building blocks in organic transformations because they
can react with both nucleophiles and electrophiles at their C sites.2 A number of researchers have focused on the attractive
characteristics of isonitriles, and the applications of these compounds
have been notably expanded. For example, organometallic complexes
coordinated by isonitriles have been prepared to investigate their
specific chemical properties.2,3 The isonitriles in these
complexes are convertible to many other organic ligands. In addition,
organic synthesis reactions using isonitriles, such as specific heterocyclizations
and multicomponent condensations, have enabled the construction of
highly functionalized compounds (right part of Figure 1).2,4 However, in contrast
to the versatility of isonitriles, methods for synthesizing these
compounds are quite limited. Indeed, most isonitriles are prepared
according to a single protocol: dehydration of the corresponding formamides.5

Figure 1 Properties and applicability of isonitriles.1−4

An alternative, traditional protocol
affording isonitriles is nucleophilic
isocyanation using cyanide as an N-nucleophile. In 1888, Schneidewind
published the pioneering study on this strategy using benzyl iodide 1 and AgCN to afford benzylic isonitrile 2 (Scheme 1).6 Cyanide is one of the most typical ambident nucleophiles,
and its C- and N-termini are both reactive. In general, however, the
C-terminus preferentially reacts with several electrophiles to form
the corresponding nitriles. In this mini-review, we will discuss several
efficient strategies for obtaining the less-accessible isonitriles
by nucleophilic substitution or addition of cyanide reagents. The
nucleophilic reactions have traditionally utilized stoichiometrically
activated cyanide reagents or less-reactive cyanide sources with stoichiometric
activators. Recently, however, some efficient nucleophilic isocyanations
with catalytic amounts of activators have been reported.

Scheme 1 Pioneering
Study on Nucleophilic Isocyanation Using AgCN6
2 Concept
of Chemoselectivity for Nucleophilic
Cyanation and Isocyanation
Kornblum and co-workers proposed
a chemoselectivity preference
for the nucleophilic substitutions using ambident reagents (Kornblum’s
rule): The “harder” terminus tends to react through
the SN1 pathway, while the “softer” terminus
reacts in an SN2 fashion.7 According
to this rule, isocyanation proceeds through an SN1-type
mechanism, since the N-terminus of cyanide is harder than the C-terminus.
However, there are some exceptions to explain the selectivity of cyanide:
(1) Methylation using very hard reagents trimethyloxonium
tetrafluoroborate and methyl triflate with tetrabutylammonium
cyanide exclusively gave acetonitrile, a C-terminus-substituted product
(Scheme 2).8 (2) When erythro-2-bromo-3-(methylthio)butane 3 was applied as an electrophile, the erythro isomers of nitrile
and isonitrile, 4 and 5, were selectively
obtained by using NaCN and AgCN as nucleophiles, respectively, although
both reactions occurred through the same trans-thiiranium
intermediate, 6 (Scheme 3).9 These substitution reactions
using the threo isomer of 3 afforded the corresponding
threo products.

Scheme 2 Selective Formation of Acetonitrile with Very Hard
Methylation Reagents8
Scheme 3 Control of the Reaction Pathway between Cyanation and Isocyanation
Based on the Reactivity of Cyanide Sources9
Today, Kornblum’s rule
is regarded as an outdated principle
for explaining the selectivity of ambident cyanide. Mayr and co-workers
carefully analyzed the preference of the reaction site (C or N) selectivity
based on the reported observations and some experimental data by themselves
and consequently proposed the following revised hypotheses. (a) A
free cyanide preferentially reacts at the C-terminus regardless of
whether the reaction proceeds through the SN1 or SN2 pathway. (b) Isocyanation with free cyanide occurs only
in the case in which C-addition reaches the diffusion limit, affording
a mixture of nitrile and isonitrile. (c) When the C-terminus is blocked
by another group, such as Me3Si+ or Ag+, the N-terminus exclusively reacts to afford the corresponding isonitriles.8

3 Isocyanation with a Stoichiometric
Activator
As mentioned above, the combination of alkyl halides,
especially
alkyl iodides, and AgCN (a C-terminus-blocked cyanide) is the most
typical approach affording the alkylisonitriles.6 Tu and co-workers applied the procedure to the
isocyanation of an in-situ-generated allylic iodide during the final
step in the synthesis of 7-epi-14-isocyano-isodauc-5-ene 8, which is the epimer of the natural product isolated from marine
sponge Acantkella acuta (Scheme 4).10

Scheme 4 Allylic
Isocyanation Using AgCN in the Synthesis of an Isocyano Sesquiterpene10
Benzoyl iodide 9 was rapidly consumed (within 10 min)
with an excess amount of AgCN to afford N-benzoylisonitrile 10, which was regarded as an electrophilic carbene surrogate,
in 73% yield.11 This compound reacted with
both electron-rich and -poor alkynes, giving complex molecules of
completely different types from each other (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Formation of Benzoyl Isonitrile and
Further Transformations11
Some alkyl bromides are also applicable to the transformation
using
stoichiometric silver reagents. For the synthesis of 1-isocyano sugars,
as reported by Descotes and co-workers, the combination of 1-bromosugar
and AgCN is effective.12 Kitano and co-workers
discovered an efficient method that furnished benzylic isonitriles
using primary benzylic bromides and trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN)
in the presence of AgClO4 as a stoichiometric activator
(Scheme 6).13 In this reaction, they proposed that highly
reactive benzylic perchlorate was generated in situ, and the following
substitution by TMSCN as a C-blocked cyanide formed the isonitrile.

Scheme 6 Stoichiometric Isocyanation of Primary Benzylic Bromide13
Songstad and co-workers focused on easily isolable onium dicyanoargentates
(Q+[Ag(CN)2]−) as nucleophiles.14,15 High nucleophilicity was expected due to their anionic character.
In fact, benzhydryl bromide 15 was transformed to isonitrile 16 in 88% yield by using (Ph4As)[Ag(CN)2] in acetonitrile (Scheme 7).14 (Me4N)[Ag(CN)2] reacted even with an alkyl chloride, although the reaction
rate was slow. Then they proposed the rate dependency upon the alkyl
groups of halides and the leaving groups for this isocyanation as
follows: tert-RX > sec-RX > prime-RX and RI > RBr > RCl.15

Scheme 7 Isocyanation of Benzhydryl Bromide with Tetraphenylarsonium Dicyanoargentate14
The modified procedure was reported by El Kaim, Grimaud, and co-workers.16 In the presence of 20 mol % Et3NBnCl
(TEBAC), benzylic isonitriles were obtained through the reaction of
benzylic bromides and in-situ-prepared KAg(CN)2 from KCN
and AgCN (Scheme 8).16a The yield of the product obviously decreased
without using phase-transfer catalyst TEBAC. This method was applied
to a one-pot sequential transformation affording oxazoles or Ugi-type
adducts, without the isolation of the stinking isonitriles.

Scheme 8 Benzylic
Isocyanation with In-Situ-Generated KAg(CN)2 in
the Presence of a Catalytic Amount of TEBAC16a
As Songstad reported,15 isocyanation
of tertiary alkyl halides including chlorides through the formation
of stable tertiary alkyl cations is relatively easy. Sasaki and co-workers
reported that adamantyl isonitrile 18 was furnished by
the reaction of adamantyl chloride 17 and TMSCN with
the stoichiometric activation of TiCl4 (Scheme 9).17 A modified method was employed as the key step in the total synthesis
of 7,10-diisocyanoadociane reported by Corey and
co-workers (Scheme 10).18 In this case, readily prepared trifluoroacetate
was used as a leaving group instead of halide. In the presence of
excess amounts of TMSCN and TiCl4, double isocyanation
product 20 as a mixture of four diastereomers was obtained
in 70% yield from 19. The diastereomeric ratio of the
diaxial/axial–equatorial and equatorial–axial/diequatorial
isomers was 30:55:15.

of 1-Chloroada-mantane to
the Corresponding Isonitrile17
Scheme 10 Total Synthesis of 7,10-Diisocyanoadocian through
TiCl4-Assisted Double Isocyanation18
Kitano and co-workers reported
the direct isocyanation of tertiary
alcohols. Both ZnBr2 and AgClO4 efficiently
promoted the reaction using TMSCN as a cyanide source.19 The reaction of 1-adamantanol 21 with AgClO4 quantitatively afforded the desired product
(Scheme 11).19b The Brønsted acid-assisted one-pot (three
steps) formal isocyanation of tertiary alcohols was also reported
(Scheme 12).20 This procedure without metallic species was
applied to the formation of benzylic isonitriles with medium yield.

Scheme 11 AgClO4-Mediated Isocyanation of Tertiary Alcohols19b
Scheme 12 MsOH-Mediated Formal Isocyanation of Alcohols20
Mukaiyama’s oxidation–reduction
condensation is a
potent strategy for the synthesis of secondary alkyl isonitriles (Scheme 13).21 An alkoxy diphenylphosphine is a suitable electrophile
under the oxidative condition when using 2,6-dimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone
(DMBQ) and (EtO)2P(O)CN as a cyanide source. In the presence
of soft metal oxides such as ZnO and CdO, the corresponding isonitriles
are obtained preferentially, while the nitriles are obtained without
the addition of these metal oxides. Notably, the optically active
secondary alkoxy diphenylphosphine is converted to the isonitrile
with almost perfect stereoinversion.

Scheme 13 Isocyanation through
Oxidation–Reduction Condensation with
the DMBQ/(EtO)2P(O)CN/ZnO Protocol21
The AgClO4-promoted
isocyanation of alkenes was reported
by Kitano and co-workers (Scheme 14).22 This is the only example
affording the hydroisocyanation products from alkenes through the
nucleophilic addition of cyanide. AgClO4 acts as a π-Lewis
acid to activate alkenes, and the isocyanation proceeds on the positive
site in accordance with the Markovnikov rule.

Scheme 14 AgClO4-Promoted Isocyanation of Alkenes through the Nucleophilic
Addition of Cyanide22
4 Catalytic Nucleophilic Isocyanation
The first catalytic isocyanation was reported by Gassman and co-workers
through the ring-opening reaction of epoxides (Scheme 15).23 Only 0.5
mol % ZnI2 was sufficient to promote the reaction between
epoxides and TMSCN affording the β-hydroxyisonitrile
derivatives. Isocyanation selectively occurred at the most substituted
carbon center with stereoinversion. Utimoto and co-workers discovered
a similar isocyanation that proceeds with Pd(CN)2, SnCl2, or Me3Ga as a catalyst, while the nitriles were
obtained when an aluminum-based catalyst, such as Et2AlCl
or (iBu)2AlOiPr, was
employed.24 Oxetanes were also converted
to the corresponding γ-hydroxyisonitriles in the
presence of a relatively larger amount of ZnI2 than in
the case of epoxides.25

Scheme 15 ZnI2-Catalyzed
Ring-Opening Isocyanation of Epoxides23
The only example to date of
catalytic enantioselective isocyanation
was reported by Zhu, Pan, and co-workers.26 They demonstrated the desymmetrization of meso-epoxides
with chiral BINOL–Ga(III) complex 31 as a catalyst
(Scheme 16). Although
the substrate scope was limited, the chiral β-hydroxyisonitriles
were obtained in up to 95% ee after desilylation.

Scheme 16 Ga(III)-Catalyzed
Desymmetrization of meso-Epoxides
through Nucleophilic Isocyanation26
Shenvi and co-workers reported the catalytic
conversion of tertiary
alkyl trifluoroacetates with TMSCN into the isonitriles catalyzed
by Sc(OTf)3 (Scheme 17).27 It is well known that
the nucleophilic substitution of tertiary alcohol derivatives usually
proceeds through an SN1-type mechanism; therefore, the
chiral information on the substrates is lost through the reaction.
However, the titled isocyanation preferentially occurs with stereoinversion
because of the formation of a contact ion pair upon substitution.
The Sc(OTf)3-catalyzed isocyanation has been employed as
the key step in the total synthesis of isocyanoterpenoids,
which have antiplasmodial and antimalarial activities. Some examples
are shown in Figure 2.28

Scheme 17 Sc(OTf)3-Catalyzed Isocyanation
of Tertiary Alcohol Derivatives
with Stereoinversion27
Figure 2 Antiplasmodial and antimalarial compounds synthesized by using
catalytic isocyanation as a key step.28

Recently, Yurino, Ohkuma, and
co-workers reported a new strategy
for the catalytic isocyanation. The reaction of allylic phosphates
and TMSCN with a catalytic amount of Pd(OAc)2 selectively
afforded the linear-type allylic isonitriles in high yield (Scheme 18).29 The mechanistic studies suggested that the Pd(II) catalyst
plays multiple roles in this reaction. (Me3Si)[Pd(CN)3] and/or (Me3Si)2[Pd(CN)4] generated in situ may function as Lewis acid catalysts for the
activation of the allylic phosphate to form a relatively stable allylic
cation intermediate. TMSCN, [Pd(CN)3]−, and [Pd(CN)4]2– function as C-blocked
cyanide reagents affording both linear and branch allylic isonitriles.
The Pd(II) catalyst in the reaction has another role, i.e., transferring
the branch product to a linear one. Thus, Pd(II)-catalyzed isocyanation
proceeds without the formation of a π-allyl-Pd(II) species.

Scheme 18 Pd(II)-Catalyzed Allylic Isocyanation29
5 Conclusions
Herein, we summarized the basic concepts and representative examples
of nucleophilic isocyanation, which is a traditional but immature
strategy for the synthesis of isonitriles. Nucleophilic isocyanation
was first described in the late 19th century, but the advancement
and extension of this chemistry are still limited. This is probably
due to the difficulty in the selective formation of isonitrile over
the thermodynamically and kinetically favored isomer, nitrile. Moreover,
excess amounts of toxic metal cyanides are usually required for this
transformation. Currently, the relatively reliable dehydration of
formamides is most often chosen for the synthesis of isonitriles.
However, this procedure also has unignorable drawbacks, such as the
use of excess amounts of harmful dehydration reagents and the inevitable
isolation of isonitriles with offensive odors. In contrast, some nucleophilic
isocyanations are included in the sequential one-pot process to afford
more complex molecules without the isolation of the isonitriles. Recently,
several catalytic systems for the nucleophilic isocyanation using
less toxic TMSCN have been developed. We believe that these new protocols
will solve many of the pending problems and finally open the door
to the progression of the chemistry of isonitriles to the next stage.
