In this work, a chemical reaction between gaseous ozone
and aqueous
solution of Mn(CH3COO)2 in drops has been researched.
It has been shown that the formation of HxMnO2·nH2O nanocrystals with a morphology
of nanosheets and a birnessite-like crystal structure with a thickness
of 5–8 nm is observed on the surface of drops. These nanocrystals
are oriented spontaneously to the solution–gas interface and
constitute peculiar ribbons with a width of 1–2 μm, some
of which form ordered honeycomb structures (OHS) with a 5–20
μm cell size. To explain the observed effect, the scheme of
chemical reactions that take place at the interface between the surface
of a drop and ozone has been modeled, and it can be described using
a diffusion pattern model taking into account the action of “force
fields” on the surface of a drop, which arise due to its curvature.
After the drop is dried, these structures practically retain their
morphology and form a fractal structure with a geometric area equal
to the area of the drop base on the surface of the substrate. The
study of the electrocatalytic properties of these structures revealed
that they are active electrocatalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction
(OER) during water electrolysis in alkaline medium. The most efficient
of the obtained electrocatalysts are characterized by an overpotential
value of 284 mV at a current of 10 mA/cm2 and the Tafel
coefficient of 37.7 mV/dec and are currently one of the best among
pure manganese oxides. Finally, it has also been assumed that this
effect is explained by the morphological features of the structures
obtained, which contribute to the removal of oxygen bubbles from the
electrode surface during electrolysis.

==== Body
Introduction
As is well known, manganese oxides are
frequently used as, for
instance, electrode materials for chemical current sources,1−3 electrochemical sensors,4 adsorbents,5−7 etc. These oxides are also considered as promising noble metal-free
electrocatalysts for the decomposition of water by electrolysis.8,9 As follows from the analysis of these works, such electrocatalysts
allow water electrolysis in the alkaline medium with oxygen evolution
reaction (OER) overpotential varying from 340 to 500 mV at 10 mA/cm2 current density.10−13 It is well known that studying the oxygen evolution
is of vital importance also in connection with searching new catalysts
for organic compounds’ oxidation.14,15

A wide range of modern preparative chemistry methods are used
for
the synthesis of this substance, including the hydrothermal method,16 solid-state reaction technique,17 electrochemical deposition,18 successive ionic layer deposition,19 sol–gel,20 precipitation,21 chemical
bath deposition,22 etc.

The aim of
this investigation is the development of an interfacial
synthesis method or, rather, a gas–solution interface technique
(GSIT). This method is based on the use of sparingly soluble compounds
formed after the interaction of a salt dissolved in a liquid with
a gaseous reagent supplied to the liquid–gas interface. Previously,
GSIT was effectively applied to obtain a plethora of thin films of
manganese23 and iron oxides,24 as well as arsenic sulfide,25 lanthanum fluoride,26,27 and microtubes based
on them.

The principal feature of the experiments described
in this work
is that salt solution is applied in the form of a drop on the surface
of an inert substrate. The relevance of such work is lying in the
fact that the processes of planting and evaporating liquid drops are
the basis, for example, of two-/tree-dimensional (2D and 3D) printing
technologies28,29 or methods for producing electrodes
of various electrochemical devices, which is called “drop-casting”.30,31 During evaporation of solution and suspension drops of various substances,
unique conditions can emerge and a number of effects can be observed
that lead to the structuring of the resulting products. In particular,
one of these structuring effects is named “coffee-ring”.32,33

The experiments carried out in the current work are based
on a
new technique and compared to well-known ones. Before drying, the
surface of a salt solution drop was treated by a gaseous reagent according
to the GSIT method. The objects for the research are drops of an aqueous
solution of Mn(CH3COO)2 with a volume of 8–20
μL applied on the surface of glass, single-crystalline silicon,
or stainless steel and gaseous ozone. The choice is explained by the
fact that this reaction has already been investigated,23 and as a result, it has been shown that in the
GSIT conditions during the interaction between Mn(CH3COO)2 solution, located in the cell and having a flat interface,
and gaseous ozone, a hydrophobic film of manganese oxide (III, IV)
is formed on the surface of the solution and after completion of the
reaction it continues being localized on it.

The aim of this
work was to study the features of these films formed
on the surface of Mn(CH3COO)2 solution droplets
with various concentrations and to study their properties as an OER
electrocatalyst for water electrolysis in an alkaline medium.

Results
The Mn(CH3COO)2 solution
drops (8–20
μL in volume) having the diameter from 3 to 10 mm were placed
on the substrate surface. The contact angle for the glass substrate
was approximately 52°, for single-crystalline silicon, 20°,
and for stainless steel, this value was ∼60°. When such
droplets were dried in air, clearly visible rings were formed on the
surface of the substrate with diameters corresponding to the diameter
of the base of the droplet. Obviously, these rings are formed from
crystals of dissolved salt in accordance with the “coffee-ring”
effect. However, if the surface of the drops is treated with ozone
for 10 min or more before drying, a brown film in the form of round
spots with different shades is formed on it. It turned out that such
films obtained from solutions with a concentration of more than 0.005
M are weakly bonded to the surface of the substrate and partially
crack and separate from it. This occurs, apparently, due to the presence
of mechanical stresses in such films and the appearance of forces
distorting their planar geometry.

An optical microscopy study
of such drops on a glass surface immediately
after the reaction showed that a layer of separate bizarre curved
“ribbons” is formed on the drop surface. Several images
of such ribbons, taken in transmission modes, are shown in Figure 1. As can be seen
from these figures, the width of such ribbons is several microns and
they form a network of ordered honeycomb-like structures (OHSs) in
a number of areas. Part of these structures forms peculiar circles
with a diameter of up to 100 μm. This network does not disappear
after the drop is dried.

Figure 1 Optical images of drops’ surfaces on
the glass obtained
from 0.0015 M (a, d), 0.003 M (b, e), and 0.005 M (c, f) Mn(CH3COO)2 solution after the treatment with gaseous
ozone for 10 min.

These effects were observed on no less than 2 dozen
different samples,
but it was not possible to identify a clear effect that characterizes
the location of OHS on the spot surface. We can only evaluate the
probability of the appearance of such OHS among the common fractal
structures for various samples, which is about 10–30%, and
it is higher in the center of the spot.

After drying these drops,
colored spots remained on the surface
of the substrates and then were studied by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and Raman
spectroscopy. According to the results of SEM analysis (Figure 2) on the surface of droplets
of more concentrated solutions, ribbons of a relatively larger width
are formed and their density is higher. It is significant that these
networks of ribbons practically do not collapse after the droplets
dry in air. The width of individual ribbons is 1–2 μm,
and they form six- and five-membered OHS meshes a with size of 5–20
μm. It should be noted that in a number of spots, the alternation
of six- and five-membered structures is similar to an alternation
in the structure of carbon atoms in fullerene or a sequence of fragments
on the surface of a soccer ball. From the FESEM images (Figure 3), it can be seen that each
of the ribbons consists of separate randomly oriented planar nanocrystals
with a thickness of about 5–8 nm. It follows from Figure 3c that the ribbon
thickness is about 150 nm.

silicon surface, obtained
from 0.0015 M (a, d), 0.003 M (b, e), and 0.005 M (c, f) Mn(CH3COO)2 solution after the treatment with gaseous
ozone for 10 min.

magnifications; (d–f) top views of various parts of the tape.

As follows from the X-ray diffraction data (Figure 4a), nanocrystals
are characterized by an
X-ray diffraction pattern with peaks at 37.6, 55.0, and 66.0°.
These three peaks can be indexed to layered birnessite-like manganese
oxide with hexagonal crystalline lattice (a = b ≈ 5.82, c = 14.62, JCPDS No. 018-0802),
also called δ-MnO2.34 A
birnessite tends to be nanocrystalline, and its hexagonal layer consists
of 2D edge-shared MnO6 octahedra (usually Mn4+/Mn3+ ions) with different cations and water molecules
in the interlayer space.35 The ratio of
Mn3+ to Mn4+ as well as the content of H+ and water molecules in the interlayer space is difficult
to evaluate, since it strongly depends on the synthesis conditions
and can vary because of the influence of external factors, for example,
during the storage or changing of the solution acidity,36 etc. Since no other cations could be included
in the structures obtained by GSIT, we can identify the formula of
the synthesized compound as HxMnO2. This is also proved by Raman spectrum of a substance in Figure 3b, where peaks at
292, 505, 575, 654, and 737 cm–1 belong to HxMnO2 with a crystalline structure
similar to birnessite.37 According to ref (38), the presence of peaks
at 505, 575, and 654 cm–1 indicates a crystalline
structure with many defects that determine the high electrocatalytic
activity in OER.

nanocrystals
formed on the surface of a Mn(CH3COO)2 (C = 0.003 M) solution drop placed on a glass substrate after
10 min treatment with gaseous ozone and drying in air.

Electrocatalytic properties of the synthesized
layers were analyzed
using the solutions with concentrations of 0.0015, 0.003, and 0.005
M and treatment time of 10 min. The best electrochemical characteristics
in the OER during alkaline electrolysis of water had a sample obtained
using a solution with a concentration of 0.003 M (Figure 5a). As follows from it, it
is characterized by the lowest overpotential value of 284 mV at 10
mA/cm2. An important parameter characterizing the microkinetics
of catalytic processes in OER is the Tafel slope, which can be measured
as the current density logarithm versus overpotential, and for the
last noted sample, its value is equivalent to 37.7 mV/dec (Figure 5b). Apparently, for
this sample, OHS of manganese oxide with optimal parameters for electrocatalysis
is formed on the surface of the substrate.

Discussion
In our opinion, when a drop of solution
is treated with ozone,
the following sequence of interactions occurs on its surface. Thus,
the first stage is a redox reaction between ozone molecules of the
gas phase and Mn(II) cations on the solution surface 1  It is important to mark that CH3COOH molecules are formed in this reaction, which are removed from
the solution as the droplets dry. The other reaction products are
hydrophobic seeds of HxMnO2·nH2O nanocrystals, which at a given neutral pH value
of the solution have a negative charge and therefore repel each other
and form a layer of nanoparticles at equal distances on the solution
surface. After a while, there is a diffusion of ozone molecules into
the salt solution through the surface free of nanocrystals and they
start to grow from the solution side, due to which they become larger.
The formation of such nanocrystals is promoted by convection flows,39 which are known to be observed in a drop during
its drying and contact with air. This process, in turn, leads to mixing
of a solution of Mn(CH3COO)2 and aligning of
its concentration in the whole volume of a drop.

From our perspective,
HxMnO2·nH2O
nanocrystal growth at the interface between
the drops and air can be described by taking into account the diffusion
pattern model,40−42 which describes the fractal growth of crystals under
the conditions when chemical reactions and the process of diffusion
of reagents into the reaction zone simultaneously take place. Such
conditions are the most convenient for ordered periodic arrangement
in space of the chemical reaction products.

It can also be assumed
that during the formation of the honeycomb-like
structures, the forces that arise on the surface of the drop due to
its curvature play a paramount role. Such forces include both the
force of gravity, which promotes the movement of nanocrystals “down
the slope” of the drop surface, and the force of convection
flows arising inside the drop and on its surface during partial evaporation.
These additional interactions on the surface of the drop form unique
force fields that lead to the formation of the ordered honeycomb-like
structures with a minimum energy. The hypothetical model of OHS formation
is shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Scheme of the formation of manganese oxide OHS: (a–d) cross
view and (e) top view.

In general, we should point out that the results
obtained exceed
the analogic electrocatalytic characteristics of similar composition
catalysts, synthesized by other methods (Table 1). As one can see from this table, the closest
values of the overpotential of 343 mV and the Tafel coefficient of
43.6 mV/dec has the MnO2 with carbon dots incorporation,12 but these values are worse than achieved in
the current work. Apparently, this is due to the unique morphological
features of the synthesized HxMnO2·nH2O nanocrystals and the presence of pores
between them that contribute to more effective removal of oxygen bubbles
in the electrochemical process concerned. It is significant that the
obtained electrocatalyst is also characterized by high stability of
properties, for example, when it was tested for 10 h at a given overvoltage
value of 284 mV, the current value decreased by only 2 percent (not
shown in Figure 5).
An important feature of the discussed synthetic method is the possibility
to set precisely the conditions of the synthesis. For instance, changing
the Mn(CH3COO)2 solution concentration and therefore
obtaining a series of similar electrocatalyst samples allows us to
choose the samples with optimal electrochemical characteristics. Undoubtedly,
the properties of such materials can be further improved, particularly,
by doping the nanocrystals with various electrocatalytically active
metals, by intercalation of various substances into the interlayer
space of metal hydroxides or by incorporating HxMnO2·nH2O nanocrystals into nanocomposites
with carbon materials. This topic is a subject of our future studies.

Thus, for the first time, synthetic conditions were
found for planar
ordered honeycomb-like structures with 5–20 micron cells without
the use of special surfactants and templates, consisting of tightly
packed oriented HxMnO2·nH2O planar nanoparticles with a 5–8 nm thick birnessite-type
hexagonal crystal structure. It is demonstrated that due to the unique
morphology, these structures on the surface of stainless steel are
effective electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction during
electrolysis of water in alkaline conditions. There is no doubt that
these OHSs have a number of other practically important properties
and can find application, for example, as the material for the creation
of new highly efficient electrodes, electrochemical sensors, etc.

Conclusions
When ozone interacts with the surface of
Mn(CH3COO)2 solution droplets, planar nanocrystals
of manganese oxide
Mn(III, IV), with a thickness of 5–8 nm and a crystal structure
similar to birnessite, are formed on it. These nanocrystals are spontaneously
oriented along the solution–gas interface and form peculiar
ribbons with a width of 1–2 μm, some of which form ordered
honeycomb-like structures with a cell size of 5–20 μm.
This effect can be explained using a diffusion pattern model taking
into account redox reactions and reagent diffusion in the layer on
the drop surface, resulting in the formation of nanocrystals of the
above-noted composition and structure. As the reaction proceeds, these
nanocrystals fall into additional force fields on the droplet surface
and, as a result, “fit” into ordered structures. After
the drop is dried, they retain their morphology and form a fractal
structure on the surface of the substrate with a geometric area equal
to the area of the drop base. The study of the electrocatalytic properties
of these structures on the surface of stainless steel depicted that
they are active electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction
during electrolysis of water in the alkaline solution. The best of
the obtained electrocatalysts is characterized by an overvoltage value
of 284 mV at a current of 10 mA/cm2 and a slope of the
Tafel coefficient of 37.7 mV/dec, which is currently among the best
for manganese oxides. The morphological features of the synthesized
structures, which during electrolysis contribute to the removal of
oxygen bubbles from the electrode surface, apparently explain these
properties.

Methods
Synthesis of the Ordered Honeycomb-like Structures of Manganese
Oxide
Mn(CH3COO)2 (analytical grade
from Vecton) is one of the reagents. Aqueous solutions were prepared
using Milli-Q high-purity water with resistivity approximately 18
MΩ/cm. Plates of a glass or single-crystalline silicon with
size 20 × 20 × 0.3 mm3 and plates of stainless
steel (8 × 20 × 0.5 mm3) were used as the substrates.
Before synthesis, these plates were treated in an ultrasonic bath
filled with a solution of acetone for 20 min. After that, plates of
glass were placed into a diluted KOH solution (pH = 9.5), kept there
for 30 min, washed with water, and dried in air at room temperature.
Single-crystalline silicon wafers were etched in concentrated HF for
15 min and then washed in distilled water multiple times to remove
the excess acid. After that, they were treated for 20 min with a mixture
of 3% H2O2 and NH4OH solutions with
pH ∼ 9.5, washed with water, and dried in air. Stainless steel
plates were polished using abrasive paper, treated in an acetone ultrasonic
bath for 20 min, washed, and dried the same way as mentioned above.

The synthesis procedure consists of several steps. First of all,
Mn(CH3COO)2 solution drops with a concentration
of 0.001–0.1 M were planted on the surface of substrates and
then placed in a flow reactor with a diameter of 20 mm, into which
a mixture of air and ozone was supplied. The air flow rate was 30
l/h. Ozone was produced by barrier-type pulse generator OZ-1 M with
an ozone output of 0.4 g/h. The time of the sample treatment ranged
from 1 to 10 min.

Characterization
As a result of the reaction with ozone,
a light brown film was formed on the surface of the drops, and after
drying, it was studied by SEM, Raman, and X-ray diffraction techniques.
Important information was obtained via optical microscopy using a
Biolam microscope (manufactured by LOMO) equipped with an Almeria
digital camera, taking images in transmission modes. Here, micrographs
of drops’ surface after its interaction with ozone as well
as after drying it at room temperature were saved. The measurement
of the wetting angle was performed using a goniometer, LK-1 (manufactured
by the “Open Science”), with an accuracy of ±1°.
Electron micrographs were obtained with microscopes Zeiss EVO-40EP
and Zeiss Auriga. X-ray diffraction analysis was performed on a Bruker
D2 Phaser diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα X-ray source.
Raman spectra were obtained using a LabRAM HR 800 spectrometer (Horiba
Jobin Yvon) with a He–Ne laser as the excitation source and
power of 0.018 mWt, where accumulation time was 600 s.

Electrochemical Characterization
Electrochemical experiments
were conducted at room temperature using a standard three-electrode
cell connected to an Elins P-30I potentiostat. A stainless steel plate
with a spot of manganese oxide with a diameter of 3–5 mm was
used as the working electrode. Platinum foil and Ag/AgCl (aq. KCl
sat.) electrode were used as the counter electrode and as the reference
electrode, respectively. The electrolyte was 1 M KOH solution (pH
= 13). Polarization curves were acquired at a scan rate of 5 mV/s.
Electrochemical measurements were made with iR compensation. The overpotential
was converted from the Ag/AgCl electrode scale to a reversible hydrogen
electrode (RHE) scale according to Nernst eq 2 2  where E°Ag/AgCl is the standard potential of the Ag/AgCl electrode and EAg/AgCl is the potential of the Ag/AgCl electrode, obtained
by measurement. Equation 3 was used to calculate the Tafel coefficient. 3  where b is the Tafel coefficient, η is the overpotential, and j is
the current density. The last one was calculated with respect to the
electrocatalyst area on the electrode surface.
