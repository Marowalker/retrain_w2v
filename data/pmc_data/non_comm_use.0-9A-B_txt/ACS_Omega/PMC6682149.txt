Oscillating reactions are reactions
in which it is possible to
observe oscillations in the concentrations of some reaction intermediates.
The reaction studied here is composed of acetone, sulfuric acid, bromate,
oxalic acid, and Ce(IV). Chemical oscillators may have different behaviors
in batch, for example, the presence of an induction period and change
of oscillations’ pattern. A much rarer event is the presence
of a break, or pause, between two groups of oscillations, which is
shown by this system. To better determine the conditions under which
this behavior occurs, we built several phase diagrams for the initial
concentrations of reactants. These phase diagrams show that there
is a well-defined range of concentrations that produce a pause in
the oscillations. The initial bromate concentration is special because
increasing this concentration eliminates the pause in the oscillations,
but a further increase can make a pause appear again. These results
can be interpreted considering that the reaction mechanism is controlled
by at least two intermediates. In addition, this work presents a representative
set of data that must be acknowledged by any detailed proposal of
mechanism for this oscillating reaction.

Introduction
Oscillating reaction is a kind of nonlinear
behavior observed in
chemical systems in both batch and flow regimes.1,2 In
the last case, several different behaviors have been well characterized,
but in the batch regime, the situation is more difficult because the
concentration of reactants decreases all the time, until the oscillations
die. A very special behavior in batch is the sudden interruption of
the oscillations for a while, followed by their resumption, without
any external interference. In other words, there is a pause in the
oscillations. This remarkable behavior has been reported for the first
time in the Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) modified system iodide–bromate–malonic
acid–Ce(IV) by Kaner and Epstein.3 Following this article, Heilweil et al. reported the presence of
different kinds of oscillations, separated in time, in a BZ system
containing three different organic substrates (malonic acid, acetylacetone,
and ethyl acetoacetate).4 These authors
concluded that each isolated sequence of oscillations was due to a
different oscillation reaction with one of the three organic substrates
and because of this they coined the name sequential oscillations.

Several other authors also observed a pause in oscillations. Cooke
investigated the Briggs–Rauscher oscillating reaction modified
by addition of acetone and observed a pause in oscillations, which
he called double-barreled oscillations.5 Wittmann et al.6 called the pause observed
in the bromate–oxalic acid–acetone–Ce(IV) system
a temporary nonoscillatory state. However, the name sequential oscillations
is almost settled by now to indicate the presence of a pause between
a group of oscillations, in batch.7−12 The systems that present sequential oscillations may include a metal
catalyst or can be uncatalyzed.9,10,13 Concentration of oxygen over the solution can also determine the
emergence of sequential oscillations, as in the case of a BZ system
catalyzed by ferroin.14 For oscillating
reactions in micellar systems produced by the presence of a surfactant,
the concentration of the surfactant may determine the occurrence of
sequential oscillations.15 Photochemical
systems, as bromate–(4-aminophenol)–Ce(IV) and bromate–(2-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone)–Ce(IV),
can also present sequential oscillations.12,16

Only for a few systems that present sequential oscillations
in
batch, there are detailed phase diagrams indicating the simultaneous
range of concentrations for two reactants.5,14 In
this work, we present five two-dimension phase diagrams for sequential
oscillations observed in the system bromate–oxalic acid–acetone–Ce(IV).6,17 These phase diagrams show that the emergence of sequential oscillations
is more sensible to some reactants than others, and the use of special
mathematical functions in some axes produces linear boundaries between
the regions for sequential oscillations and regular oscillations or
nonoscillatory behavior. The effects of the concentrations of reactants
over the length of the pause and the induction period were also investigated.

Bromate–Oxalic
Acid–Acetone–Ce(IV) Oscillating
Reaction and Its Mechanism
In 1971, Kasperek and Bruice failed
to obtain oscillations using oxalic acid as an organic reductor.18 In 1979, Noszticzius et al.19 observed oscillations bubbling H2 to remove
Br2 and later by addition of acetone with the same purpose.17 Bromine is removed by its reaction with the
enol of acetone (see eqs 15 and 16 below).20

The bromate–oxalic acid–acetone–Ce(IV)
oscillating reaction is considered simpler than the BZ reaction, which
uses malonic acid, because the first forms less different organic
products and intermediates. Moreover, the Br– source
cannot be a brominated organic compound, like bromomalonic in the
Field–Körös–Noyes (FKN)21 mechanism, because oxalic acid does not form any brominated
product, and bromoacetone does not react at a significant speed with
Ce(IV).20,22 The Br– is mainly formed
by bromine hydrolysis (eq 3 below).

A detailed mechanism for the bromate–oxalic
acid–acetone–Ce(IV)
oscillating reaction, containing 24 reactions, was proposed, in 1985,
by Field and Boyd (FB), as shown below.20 To make the presentation of this mechanism simpler than in the original
article, the reactions that do not contribute (FB-11, FB-13, FB-17,
FB-18, FB-19, FB-27, FB-33, and FB-36; FB means the Field and Boyd20 mechanism) were deleted. Some of these reactions
were indicated in the FB article20 as “does
not contribute” and others as “cannot be separated from reaction 12 or 28.” As reaction FB-17, which forms the radical CH3COCH2•, does not contribute to
the mechanism, reaction FB-19 can also be deleted. In addition, reaction 17 (FB-26), between
bromate and oxalic acid, was corrected by the addition of one H+ in the left side. The deleted reactions are indicated below,
following the FB mechanism’s reactions. The labels for reactions 1–10 are the same as in the FB mechanism. 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   11   12   13   14   15   16   17   18   19   20   21   22   23  Reactions
that can be deleted from the original
FB mechanism 24   25   26   27   28   29   30   31   32  The reactions involving only bromine and cerium
chemistry are the same as in the FKN mechanism.21Reactions 1–3 form what is called the first process
(P1, which is a set of nonradical reactions that keeps the system
in a reduced state because of a low [Ce4+] and low absorbance
at 318 nm) in the FKN mechanism for the BZ reaction. Reactions 4, 5, and 7 form the second process (P2, which
is a set of radical reactions that keeps the system in an oxidized
state because of a high [Ce4+] and high absorbance at 318
nm). The third process in the FKN includes reaction 8, but the other reactions are different in
the FB mechanism because oxalic acid cannot be brominated. In this
way, the production of Br–, which changes the control
of the reaction from the set of reactions P2 to P1, is made by the
reaction between acetone (and their brominated products) and bromine
(reactions 16 and 21–23). Oxalic acid is
responsible for the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ (reactions 12 and 13), together with reaction 8.

Using this mechanism, Pereira and
Faria23 observed several complex behaviors
for this system by computer modeling,
some of them not observed experimentally yet. Experimental work on
this system has shown that for the oscillations to start, it is necessary
for some Ce4+ to be changed to Ce3+. This can
be obtained by the slow reaction between acetone and Ce4+ in a reactant solution or using directly a Ce3+ salt
as a catalyst.24,25

Bubbling an inert gas is
also used to remove Br2, without
the use of acetone. In this case, a more recent mechanim22,26 considers that Br2 can also be removed by reaction with
HCO2•. This mechanism considers several
radical reactions that were not included in the FB mechanism and also
the formation of the Br2•– species.

It can be said that, until now, there is only one proposed mechanism
for the bromate–oxalic acid–acetone–Ce(IV) oscillating
reaction, and there is no realistic mechanism that explains the emergence
of sequential oscillations in batch. In the present work, the FB mechanism
is used to explain the formation of sequential oscillations. In addition,
a more general topological approach is also presented.

Methods
The solutions were prepared using chemicals of analytical grade
without further purification. Water was purified through distillation
followed by deionization. All solutions were produced and stored for
up to 2 months, except for the acetone solution, which was prepared
on the day it was used. Initial concentrations of the stock solutions
were as follows: acetone 1.0 mol L–1 (95%, Merck),
oxalic acid 0.50 mol L–1 (Quimbras), sulfuric acid
8.71 mol L–1 (95%, Vetec), sodium bromate 0.25 mol
L–1 (99.5%, Vetec), and cerium sulfate 0.015 mol
L–1 (85%, Vetec). Sulfuric acid concentration on
the stock solution was measured by titration using sodium hydroxide
0.1 mol L–1 (97%, Grupo Química Industrial
Ltda).

The sodium hydroxide was titrated with potassium hydrogen
phthalate
(99.95%, Grupo Química Industrial Ltda). The reaction
was held in a 3 mL quartz cell with an optic path of 1 cm and a Teflon
lid. The spectrophotometer (Agilent 8435) was equipped with a deuterium
lamp. The spectra from 200 to 800 nm were acquired every 0.5 s (cycle
time) for at least 30 min. Due to the short cycle time, the cell was
continuously irradiated by the deuterium lamp throughout the reaction.
The Ce(IV) peak at 318 nm was used to follow the oscillations. We
assumed that the ultraviolet light does not significantly affect the
reaction because our data is in agreement with previous reports on
this system.6 Temperature was kept at 24.1
± 0.3 °C using a thermostatic bath (ETICA 521) connected
to a thermostatized cell holder, which can also perform magnetic stirring.
The 0.3 mm × 0.9 mm magnetic stirrer is Teflon coated.

Reactants’ solutions were added to the quartz cell in the
following order: water, sulfuric acid, acetone, oxalic acid, bromate,
and Ce(IV). Spectrum acquisition started immediately after addition
of the Ce(IV) solution. The stirring rate was kept at, approximately,
200 rpm.

Results
Sequential oscillations are known for several
chemical systems,
as indicated in the Introduction section,
but the reports in the literature, usually, only indicate a few ranges
of reactants’ concentration for which this behavior occurs.
One exception is the work by Cooke,5 which
describes the effect of the reactant’s concentrations in the
length of the pause for the Briggs–Rauscher oscillating reaction.
In this work, we determined several phase diagrams for the bromate–oxalic
acid–acetone–Ce(IV) oscillating reaction, which can
help understand in more detail the mechanism of this reaction.

Acetone vs
Sulfuric Acid Phase Diagram
Fixing the initial
concentrations of bromate, oxalic acid, and Ce(IV), the initial concentrations
of sulfuric acid and acetone were changed in the range of 1.0–3.0
and 0.06–0.45 mol L–1, respectively. Depending
on the initial acetone concentration, three different behaviors were
observed, as shown in Figure 1: (d) regular oscillations, which start immediately; (b,c)
sequential oscillations; and (a) regular oscillations, which start
after an induction period. These behaviors are indicated in Figure 2 by different colors.
In addition, the length of the pause between two oscillating regimes
and the length of the induction period are indicated by the size of
the dots.

Figure 1 Different behaviors observed by changing the initial concentration
of acetone: (a) 0.190; (b) 0.185; (c) 0.160; and (d) 0.155 mol L–1. Other constraints: [BrO3–]0 = 0.020; [(COOH)2]0 = 0.050;
[Ce(IV)]0 = 0.0010; [H2SO4]0 = 1.70 mol L–1.

(Figure 1b,c) are indicated
in magenta. The size of magenta dots indicates the length of the pause.
Regular oscillations preceded by an induction period (Figure 1a) are indicated in brown.
The size of the brown dots indicates the length of the induction period.
Other concentrations are the same as in Figure 1.

As can be observed in Figure 2, sequential oscillations occur in a narrow range of
[H2SO4]0 and [acetone]0. Inside this region, as [acetone]0 increases, the number
of oscillations before the pause decreases and the length of the pause
increases, until it becomes an induction period (Figure 1). The length of the induction
period tends to be greater at higher [H2SO4]0. This phase diagram also indicates that if one of these initial
concentrations is reduced, the other must be increased to allow the
observation of the sequential oscillations. In addition, the lowest
value of [H2SO4]0 is, approximately,
33% of the highest value, but the lowest value of [acetone]0 is 12.5% of the highest value, indicating that [H2SO4]0 is more critical for the emergence of sequential
oscillations than [acetone]0. Figure 3 shows that the borders of the sequential
oscillations’ region can be turned linear using ln[acetone]0 in the abscissa axis.

Figure 3 Phase diagram ln[acetone]0 vs
[H2SO4]0 showing linear borders for
the sequential oscillations’
region, which is located between both lines (Figure 2). The blue line (y = −1.077x – 0.2371; R2 = 0.985)
indicates regular oscillations (Figure 1d) and the brown line (y = −1.096x + 0.03825; R2 = 0.982) indicates
regular oscillations preceded by an induction period (Figure 1a). All conditions are the
same as in Figure 1.

Other Behaviors Observed
In the
middle range of [H2SO4]0, the use
of low [acetone]0 produces mixed-mode oscillations, preceded
by an induction
period, displaying low absorbance (low [Ce(IV)], reduced state), instead
of regular oscillations, as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Mixed-mode oscillations at intermediate [H2SO4]0 (1.53 mol L–1) and low [acetone]0 (0.061 mol L–1).
Other concentrations are
the same as in Figure 1.

At low concentrations, [H2SO4]0 = 1.0 mol L–1, and at [acetone]0 =
0.040 mol L–1, there is no induction period and
the second group of oscillations in the sequential oscillations starts
gradually (Figure 5). In this case, we can say that after the pause, the system crosses
a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, differently as observed in Figure 1b,c, in which, after
the pause, we can consider that the system crosses a subcritical Hopf
bifurcation.27,28

Figure 5 Crossing a supercritical Hopf bifurcation
after the pause, at low
[H2SO4]0 (1.0 mol L–1) and [acetone]0 (0.040 mol L–1). Other
concentrations are the same as in Figure 1.

At high [H2SO4]0, above
2.50 mol
L–1, the oscillation patterns start becoming more
complex, presenting irregular small amplitude oscillations (low absorbance;
low [Ce(IV)], reduced state) during the “pause” and
other irregularities, as shown in Figure 6. In this way, it can be considered that
no regular oscillations occur at these high [H2SO4]0. However, although irregular, the total duration of
the oscillations is the longest we observed, especially at low [acetone]0, as can be seen in Figure 7.

Figure 6 Irregular patterns of oscillations at high [H2SO4]0: (a) [H2SO4]0 = 2.60 mol L–1, [acetone]0 =
0.075
mol L–1; (b) [H2SO4]0 = 2.60 mol L–1, [acetone]0 = 0.070
mol L–1; (c) [H2SO4]0 = 2.90 mol L–1, [acetone]0 = 0.065
mol L–1; (d) [H2SO4]0 = 2.90 mol L–1, [acetone]0 = 0.060
mol L–1. Other concentrations are the same as in Figure 1.

Figure 7 Irregular oscillations at very high [H2SO4]0 (3.10 mol L–1) and low [acetone]0 (0.035 mol L–1). Other concentrations are
the same as in Figure 1.

Bromate vs Sulfuric Acid
and Bromate vs Acetone Phase Diagrams
Figures 8 and 9 present the
phase diagrams describing the relations
between the initial concentrations of bromate and sulfuric acid and
bromate and acetone, respectively. As can be seen in both diagrams,
the effect of the initial concentration of bromate is opposite to
the effect of the initial concentration of acetone in Figures 2 and 3. If the initial concentration of bromate is increased, the concentrations
of sulfuric acid or acetone must also be increased to allow the observation
of sequential oscillations. Similarly, as in Figures 2 and 3, the region
for sequential oscillations is between the region for regular oscillations
and the region for regular oscillations preceded by an induction period.
It can also be observed that the pause increases as [acetone]0 is increased.

(Figure 1b,c) are indicated

[H2SO4]0 = 1.50 mol L–1.

Other Behaviors Observed
At intermediate
initial concentrations
of acetone and sulfuric acid ([acetone]0 = 0.200 mol L–1, [H2SO4]0 = 1.50
mol L–1 several different behaviors are observed
at low bromate initial concentration. (i) Reduction of [BrO3–]0 from 0.0175 to 0.010 mol L–1 produces only one set of regular oscillations because the second
group of oscillations disappears, as shown in Figure 10. This behavior is different from that observed
at higher initial bromate concentrations, when reduction of [BrO3–]0 changes the sequential oscillations
to regular oscillations preceded by an induction period, as indicated
in the phase diagrams shown in Figures 8 and 9. (ii) On increasing [BrO3–]0 from 0.030 to 0.050 mol L–1, we observe a sequence of behaviors, as shown in Figure 11: (a) sequential
oscillations; (b) regular oscillations; (c) sequential oscillations
again; and (d) sequential oscillations with a large pause and a small
number of oscillations after the pause. The behavior observed in Figure 11 is remarkable
(mostly Figure 11a–c),
which suggests that there are two oscillating regimes separated by
a pause: the first with lower frequency and the second with higher
frequency. In addition, the first regime goes directly to the second
regime without going through a pause (Figure 11b).

mol L–1. (a) [BrO3–]0 = 0.0175 mol L–1; (b) [BrO3–]0 = 0.010 mol L–1. Other constraints: [(COOH)2]0 = 0.050 mol
L–1; [Ce(IV)]0 = 0.0010 mol L–1.

L–1. Other constraints: [(COOH)2]0 = 0.050 mol L–1; [Ce(IV)]0 =
0.0010 mol L–1.

Acetone vs Oxalic Acid Phase Diagram
The effect of
changing the initial concentration of acetone and oxalic acid is shown
in Figure 12. As in
other phase diagrams, the region for sequential oscillations is between
the regions of regular oscillations and regular oscillations preceded
by an induction period. At [acetone]0 = 0.20 mol L–1, decreasing [(COOH)2]0 goes
through regular oscillations, sequential oscillations, and regular
oscillations with an induction period. At [(COOH)2]0 as low as 0.021 mol L–1, the system does
not oscillate anymore. In addition, low [(COOH)2]0 favors longer pauses.

(Figure 1d); sequential
oscillations
(Figure 1b,c) are indicated

Other constraints: [BrO3–]0 = 0.020; [Ce(IV)]0 = 0.0010; [H2SO4]0 = 1.50 mol L–1.

Acetone vs Ce(IV) Phase Diagram
The effect of changing
the initial concentration of acetone and Ce(IV) is shown in Figure 13. One consequence
of changing [Ce4+]0 is the change of the amplitude
of oscillations (not shown) because the wavelength used to follow
the reaction corresponds to the [Ce4+]0. As
shown in Figure 13, decreasing [Ce4+]0 goes through regular oscillations,
sequential oscillations, and regular oscillations with an induction
period. Decreasing [Ce4+]0 also increases the
length of the pause or the induction period.

oscillations are indicated in blue (Figure 1d); sequential oscillations (Figure 1b,c) are indicated in magenta.

Discussion
Induction Period
Induction periods
usually appear due
to a growth of the pause period on sequential oscillations (Figures 1 and 2). They start with a short and fast decrease of Ce4+ absorbance followed by a slow, long, and almost horizontal decrease
of this absorbance, until the system starts to oscillate with high
amplitude oscillations (subcritical Hopf bifurcation).

Ce4+ has a greater absorbance in sulfuric acid than in water.
This might happen due to the formation of complexes with water or
OH– ions (eqs 33 and 34), which would absorb
at wavelengths different from 318 nm.29,30 On the other
hand, at high [H2SO4]0, the interaction
with other ions such as SO42– forms complexes
that absorb at 318 nm (eqs 35–38). Complexation of Ce4+ with SO42– and OH– has already been described,29−35 and the proposed reactions by these authors are shown below 33   34   35   36   37   38   39  The formation of
a stable complex between
Ce4+ and SO42– would decrease
the availability of Ce4+ to oxidize oxalic acid, forming
an induction period. This induction period would represent the time
needed for intermediates to accumulate and start an autocatalytic
process that would start the oscillations. Although the complexation
of Ce4+ by sulfate has been recognized since the first
model for oscillating reactions,21 as it
is a key step to stabilize this ion and change the potential of the
redox pair Ce3+/Ce4+, until now, no mechanism
for oscillating reactions has considered the formation of these complexes.

Sequential Oscillations
The phase diagrams presented
in Figures 2, 3, 8, 9, 12, and 13 show that
sequential oscillations occur in a narrow range between regular oscillations
and the induction period. Sequential oscillations may appear by increasing
[H2SO4]0 or [acetone]0 (Figures 2 and 3). To keep inside the sequential oscillations’
region, if [H2SO4]0 is increased,
[acetone]0 must be decreased, and vice versa. The relations
of [H2SO4]0 and [acetone]0 with the other reactants are different, as shown in Figures 8, 9, 12, and 13. In these
cases, if [H2SO4]0 or [acetone]0 is increased, the other reactant must be also increased to
be inside the sequential oscillations’ region.

In sequential
oscillations, a pause separates two distinct groups of oscillations.
These groups may have some clear differences, as shown in Figure 11. The first group
has a shoulder at the right side of the upper peak, which enlarges
the peak and, as a result, the system stays longer in the oxidized
state. Contrarily, the second group has slender peaks, which has a
shoulder in the left side; meanwhile, the right side decreases as
an exponential, enlarging the base.

The break between the two
groups of oscillations in Figure 11a is of the same type as the
one observed in Figure 1b,c. If we look for the sequence of Figure 1d,c,b, it appears that the sequential oscillations
occur through the fusion of oscillations from the first group. As
[acetone]0 increases, oscillations near the border between
the two groups start to enlarge until they completely merge, giving
rise to the pause period that characterizes the sequential oscillations.
If [acetone]0 is increased even higher, the pause period
grows in the direction of short times until it becomes an induction
period (Figure 1a).

Figure 11a,b shows
that increasing [BrO3–]0,
initially, suppresses the pause, which is the opposite effect of increasing
[acetone]0 (compare with Figure 1d,c). However, as shown in Figure 11b,c, a new pause period appears
by increasing [BrO3–]0. Notice
that this new pause period occurs at the same time where the previous
pause period used to end. Additional increase of [BrO3–]0 makes the pause period longer and occurs
at higher times, and the second group of oscillations presents few
oscillations, and the reaction ends in an oxidized state. Such differences
in the pattern of oscillations and the pause periods as a consequence
of changing the initial concentration of reactants suggest that this
system is controlled by more than one intermediate. In other words,
another species, besides Br–, might be controlling
the oscillations. This control can be due to one or more radicals,
as a recent mechanism has suggested.26 If
it is the case, the pause period can be a result of the transition
between these two controls.

First Group of Oscillations
The
main role of acetone
is to remove Br2 (eqs 16 and 21–23).17,20 To react with bromine, acetone
must first become an enol (eq 15). An explanation for the relation between [H2SO4]0 and [acetone]0 (Figures 2 and 3) is that changes in the concentrations of any of these reactants
can affect the rate of enol formation (eq 15). Halogenation of enol is so fast that it
is pointless to consider the reverse of eq 15. Consequently, an increase in acid concentration
would also increase the enol formation.36 Moreover, the combination of the enolization reaction with the halogenation
reaction results in an autocatalytic process because halogenation
generates H+ (eq 16), which accelerates the enolization. In addition, SO42– could also be acting as a base, accelerating
the second step of the enolization, which is the rate-determining
step of this reaction (Scheme 1). As a result, Br2 would be removed even faster
from the system if [H2SO4]0 and [acetone]0 are increased. Therefore, the induction period and the pause
period can be related to Br2 concentration, a known inhibitor
of oscillations, or they can be related to a product from the halogenation.
As the reaction between Br2 and enol yields Br– and bromoacetone (eq 16), this production of Br– would help process P3
to supply Br– to make the system switch to process
P1.

Scheme 1 Mechanistic Details of Acetone Enolization36
Ce4+ absorbance
is high during the induction period
and the pause, and Br– concentration is low. This
would require processes P2 and P3 to be in equilibrium, oxidizing
and reducing cerium, keeping [Ce3+] and [Ce4+] almost constant. However, process P1 inhibits P2 by consuming HBrO2. A possible explanation for an equilibrium between P2 and
P3 is that process P3 and halogenation of acetone supply Br– in such a way to keep P1 at an almost constant rate. Consequently,
[Br–] would be kept in a range where P1 and P2 are
in equilibrium.

When [acetone]0 is low, the first
group of oscillations
tends to stay at a reduced state. There is a noticeable separation
in the first group of oscillations if [H2SO4]0 is high or moderate. At high [H2SO4]0 (Figure 6), after the first small group of oscillations, there is a kind of
pause, which is indeed a period of irregular and small amplitude oscillations.
However, at [H2SO4]0 = 1.53 mol L–1 (Figure 4), the first small group of regular oscillations completely
disappears, but the period of irregular oscillations is kept with
oscillations with even lower amplitudes.

At high [H2SO4]0, the period of
irregular and small amplitude oscillations between the two groups
of regular oscillations (Figure 6) can be caused by an inhibition of process P2 by P1.
The fact that the system stays mostly in the reduced state implies
that this period has high Br– concentration. This
favors reaction 2 and
inhibits P2, which is responsible for Ce3+ oxidation. Because
P1 is a fast process,20 after almost complete
consumption of Br–, P2 can be ignited again. However,
due to a fast renewal of Br– through P3 and other
reactions, P1 would be promptly activated and the amplitude of oscillations
would be small and, eventually, irregular, as it was observed.

The short initial period of oscillations at high [H2SO4]0 (Figure 6) may happen due to eq 1, which is favored by H+. As a result, P1
would also be accelerated and Br– readily consumed.
Then, eq 1 would be able
to produce HBrO2 faster and favor P2, which does not happen
during the period of irregular oscillations.

At moderate [H2SO4]0, HBrO2 production would
be slower. As such, it would probably not
be able to suppress Br– production and P2 would
stay inhibited, resulting in a longer period at a reduced state without
oscillations (Figure 4). Irregular oscillations may occur due to the accumulation of an
intermediate followed by a sequence of fast reactions involving radical
species,26 which may favor P2.

Second Group
of Oscillations
Regardless of [H2SO4]0, a decrease of oscillations’ frequency
was observed as [acetone]0 was reduced (see, e.g., Figure 6). In addition, when
compared with Figure 1, the amplitude was also increased. With this reduction of oscillations’
frequencies, the system is kept longer in a reduced state, implying
that P2 is being inhibited for longer. According to the FB mechanism,20 P2 is inhibited by P1, and P1 needs Br– to operate, which can be produced by reactions 21–23. In addition,
Br– can be formed from Br2 by the reverse
of eq 3. Because of this,
this mechanism can be considered an oscillator controlled by Br2.20,37 Accumulation of Br2 can dislocate
the equilibrium of eq 3 to the left side. Such change would reduce Br– consumption by P1, and this process would be able to prevail for
longer, increasing the interval between oscillations.

As [H2SO4]0 is reduced, the second group of
oscillations tends to disappear (not shown). This behavior may be
due to a variety of factors. An explanation is that processes P1 and
P2 and also acetone enolization are dependent on H2SO4 concentration. Process P1 is probably the most directly affected
because it requires four H+. However, P1 is also responsible
for HBrO2, which is the species that is controlled by Br– to determine the prevalent process. Because many factors
are involved, it is hard to explain the sequential oscillations considering
a specific reaction or process based only on H2SO4 concentration. The reaction begins oscillating, and as it proceeds,
the concentration of intermediates increases and starts to interfere
with the equilibriums, possibly involving reactions 4 and 8. The lower the
[H2SO4]0 is, the more sensible to
these intermediates the system would be, and because of that, oscillations
would end earlier. However, decreasing [BrO3–]0 also shows a similar behavior (Figure 10). The reactions that directly rely on BrO3– and H2SO4 concentrations
are 1, 4, and 20. Reaction 1 needs two H+ to produce HBrO2, which
is consumed by 4. Reactions 4 and 20 generate BrO2•, responsible for Ce3+ oxidation. Then,
the second group of oscillations could disappear if the concentrations
of HBrO2, Br–, and BrO2• do not favor P2 and slow down P1. Therefore, the system
would slowly exit the oxidized state after the last oscillation. In
both cases shown in Figure 10, no induction period was observed. In this case, the reduction
of [BrO3–]0 stretched the
pause and dislocated it to higher times. When the second group of
oscillations is not present (Figure 10b; [BrO3–]0 = 0.010 mol L–1), the first group of oscillations
ends at the same time of the end of the pause period in Figure 10a ([BrO3–]0 = 0.0175 mol L–1).

Some authors believe that sequential oscillations may happen
due
to a change in the reducing agent. It can be added as a starting reactant5,38 or formed by the oxidation of the initial reducing agent.8,11,39 These explanations, however,
hardly apply to the system studied in this work. First is because
acetone does not reduce Ce4+ in the time scale of the oscillations.20 Second, according to a recent mechanism,26 the only species generated by oxalic acid, which
is able to reduce Ce4+ is the radical •COOH through the reaction •COOH + Ce4+ → CO2 + Ce3+ + H+. Because •COOH is an unstable species, it would not be able to
accumulate enough to be responsible for the second group of oscillations.
Instead of a change in the mechanism of reduction, the system might
be going through a change in the oxidation mechanism. The mechanism
proposed by Pelle et al.26 considers a
series of reactions between Ce3+ and radicals from bromine.
Some of the reactions are as follows 40   41  These reactions
may be an alternative to P2
on Ce3+ oxidation, even at high Br–,
since they rely on Br• instead of HBrO2. They could be the reason why the system oscillates when Br2 is accumulated. However, these reactions do not explain the
low-frequency oscillations at lower [acetone]0, which removes
Br2. If Br• is the limiting reactant
of reaction 40 and Br– is in excess, this reaction would not make an autocatalytic
process with reaction 41, and they may explain the second group of oscillations in Figure 11c,d. Oscillations
from the second group in these figures have a curvature typical of
an autocatalytic process on the left side. Such reactions would happen
until almost all Ce3+ is consumed. At high Ce4+, an autocatalytic process faster than eqs 40 and 41 would take
place. This process would renew Br• and Ce3+ through reactions with oxalic acid, acetone, and derivatives. Then,
Br• or Ce3+ would have concentration
ranges where they can induce oscillations. As the behaviors from Figure 11c,d are observed
at high [BrO3–]0, it is possible
that the second group of oscillations is indeed due to the formation
of a BrO3– derivative. Moreover, Figure 11c,d also shows
a pause period that grows from lower to higher times as [BrO3–]0 is increased. At medium [BrO3–]0 the pause disappears. However,
at high [BrO3–]0, a new pause
period appears at the frontier of the two groups of oscillations.
This new pause period is different. It takes place at times where
oscillations from the second group were observed. Reactions 40 and 41 might be responsible for this curious behavior. These reactions
could happen due to an accumulation of Br2•−, and together with P2, they would compensate the reduction of Ce4+ by oxalic acid. Then, the system would be able to oscillate
again because of Br– accumulation. Br– can inhibit P2, and oxalic acid would reduce a significant amount
of Ce4+. As Ce3+ is increased, reaction 41 would be favored again,
and the process is to be repeated until oxalic acid concentration
is low enough to not be able to compete with eq 41.

Phase Diagrams
Figure 2 shows that [H2SO4]0 and [acetone]0 do not have a linear
relationship with
reaction behavior because the graphic is slightly curved. Also, the
interval between the first and second sets of oscillations increases
as [acetone]0 decreases. This diagram can be linearized,
as shown in Figure 3. At concentrations beyond the ones shown in Figure 2, the system has irregular behaviors. Figure 3 shows two lines
with almost the same slope and a good correlation coefficient (R2 about 0.990), which is high considering the
irregularities on the frontiers in Figure 1. Therefore, Figure 3 implies that sequential oscillations may
appear if a mathematical relation between [H2SO4]0 and ln[acetone]0 is kept.

The diagram
in Figure 8 has a different
behavior from that in Figure 2 as the same behavior is observed if both reactants are increased.
In addition, for concentrations in the frontiers between two kinds
of behavior, the system is very sensible to the stirring, especially
in the ranges 1.70 mol L–1 < [H2SO4]0 < 1.75 mol L–1 and 0.0325
mol L–1 < [BrO3–]0 < 0.0375 mol L–1. The relation
between [acetone]0 and [BrO3–]0, which is shown in Figure 9, is similar to that observed in Figure 8.

Even though Figures 12 and 13 have fewer data than the former
diagrams, they show that decreasing [(COOH)2]0 or [Ce4+]0 goes through regular oscillations,
sequential oscillations, and later to regular oscillations after an
induction period.

Hopf Bifurcation
Oscillations can
start when a system
crosses a critical point called a Hopf bifurcation, which can be supercritical,
with a gradual change between stable and unstable states, or subcritical,
showing an abrupt transition between them.27,28,40 In the present study, because it was made
in batch, we cannot say that the system crosses a true Hopf bifurcation,
as there is no well-defined steady state and the system does not follow
a closed limit cycle and only damped oscillations are observed. In
this case, we must consider that the system crosses a pseudo-Hopf
bifurcation. Despite this, we will use the terms supercritical and
subcritical Hopf bifurcations to indicate a gradual or abrupt transition
between nonoscillatory and oscillatory states, respectively. In addition,
there are other kinds of bifurcations (saddle-node bifurcation, infinite-period
bifurcation, saddle-loop bifurcation), called global bifurcations,
that explain the emergence of a limit cycle (oscillations),40 but which are also difficult to characterize
in batch. In this way, we choose to use in the following the terms
supercritical and subcritical Hopf bifurcations, even if they are
not the most accurate terms.

Our results show that a pause period
is always preceded by a subcritical bifurcation, and, in general,
it is also followed by another subcritical bifurcation. Figure 1b shows a pause period between
two subcritical bifurcations, and Figure 5 shows a pause period followed by a supercritical
bifurcation. Every induction period observed was followed by a subcritical
bifurcation. In most of the experiments, oscillations ceased with
a supercritical bifurcation with the system in a reduced state (low
absorbance at 318 nm, low [Ce4+]). One exception is shown
in Figure 11d, which
ends in an oxidized state (high absorbance at 318 nm, high [Ce4+]).

Figure 14 is an
attempt to elaborate a topological description for sequential oscillations.
This figure relates two nonidentified parameters (μ and ν),
which can be the reactants’ concentrations that are consumed
during the reaction in batch. These parameters can also be any combination
of reactants’ and intermediates’ concentrations. In
this figure, there are two regions: in the white region, the system
does not oscillate, and in the gray region, the system oscillates.
These regions are separated by frontiers, which can be subcritical
or supercritical Hopf bifurcations.27,28 The colored
arrows indicate the time direction for different behaviors. The time
in which the system stays in a state, which is oscillatory or nonoscillating,
is proportional to the distance it goes through inside the white or
gray areas.

Figure 14 Topological diagram of sequential oscillations. The axes
μ
and ν represent two nonidentified parameters, which can be reactants
that are consumed during the reaction, in batch, or can be any other
parameters. The system does not oscillate in the white region and
oscillates inside the gray region. The frontiers between these two
behaviors are Hopf bifurcations. The solid line represents subcritical
bifurcations, and the dashed line represents supercritical bifurcations.
The colored arrows indicate the direction of the time. The red line
represents the path for oscillations preceded by an induction period.
The green line is the path for sequential oscillations. The blue line
is the path for regular oscillations without an induction period.
The insets exemplify the behaviors observed when following each path
as shown in Figure 1.

An induction period (Figure 14, red line) happens
when the system starts in the white
area (nonoscillating region) and, as the time goes, starts to oscillate
when it crosses the solid line (subcritical Hopf bifurcation). It
continues oscillating while it is in the gray area, and the oscillations
gradually lose amplitude until the system crosses the dashed line
(supercritical Hopf bifurcation) and enters the nonoscillatory region
again. Sequential oscillations, without an induction period (Figure 14, green line),
are observed when the system starts in the gray area. It oscillates
until crossing a subcritical bifurcation, entering the white area
and stopping to oscillate. After some time, the system starts to oscillate
again, when it enters the gray area, after crossing another subcritical
bifurcation. This second group of oscillations would gradually lose
amplitude until the system crosses a supercritical bifurcation and
completely stops oscillating. Finally, the blue path shows a system
that starts to oscillate without an induction period and shows regular
oscillations while it is inside the gray region. After some time,
the amplitude of oscillations gradually decreases until a supercritical
bifurcation is crossed and the system does not oscillate anymore.

Conclusions
This study scrutinized the concentration range
of all reactants
of the system bromate–oxalic acid–acetone–Ce(IV),
which produces sequential oscillations and other behaviors. The results
are presented in five phase diagrams, which show that keeping some
kind of relation between the concentrations is more important than
the concentration itself. In addition, the range of reactants’
concentrations that produce sequential oscillations is always between
the concentrations that produce regular oscillations without an induction
period and regular oscillations preceded by an induction period.

Some new behaviors for this system were observed, which include
a short induction period at high [H2SO4]0, a low-amplitude group of irregular oscillations, and an
induction period at a reduced state.

Based on current mechanisms,
the experimental data implies that
one additional control should be operating in this system, besides
the accepted Br– control, to explain the variety
of behaviors observed. The full set of experimental results presented
in this work is a good challenge for any mechanism to be proposed
for this system, which intends to be an improvement to the Field and
Boyd20 mechanism.
