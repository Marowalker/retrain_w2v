Using density functional theory in combination with Green’s
functional formalism, we study the effect of chemical doping on the
electronic transport properties of carbon nanotube (CNT)–metal
junctions. Both surface doping (i.e., surface fluorination) and substitutional
doping with different dopant atoms (e.g., B, N, and P) are considered.
Profound current rectification is obtained for the fluorinated samples,
whereas substitutional doping results in only small asymmetry in the
current–voltage characteristics of the system despite the smallest
differential resistance. The current rectification originates from
voltage-dependent charge localization in the system as revealed in
our transmission spectrum analysis. We also study the effect of CNT
morphology (i.e., tip opining, radius, length, chirality, and multiple
walls) on the electronic transport properties of the CNT–metal
junction. CNT–insulator–metal junctions are also investigated
as a reference to our doped systems. The results show the possibility
of creating fluorinated CNT-based diodes for practical nanoelectronic
applications, such as rectenna solar cells.

I Introduction
It is well known that
chemical doping dramatically changes both
structural and electronic properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs).1 Consequently, charge transport properties (such
as, mean-free path and conducting mechanisms) are also strongly affected
by doping.2,3 Current rectification can also be achieved
by doping CNTs with appropriate chemicals.4 In this work, we study the effect of chemical doping of the outer
surface of CNT on the charge carrier transport through the CNT–metal
interface, which has received lots of interest in recent years as
a potential system for optical rectenna applications.5−7 Contrary to conventional photovoltaic technologies where the solar
conversion efficiency is limited by the properties of the absorbing
semiconducting material (e.g., the band gap), the rectenna device
does not have such a restriction for solar energy harvesting.8−11 However, there are two main challenges, which prevent the progress
in rectenna device development.12 First,
the antenna part of the device should be small and electromagnetic/ergonomic
(optoergonomic) enough to collect waves at optical frequencies and
to convert the signal into an alternating current, which will be passed
through a diode for direct current conversion. Second, the response
of the rectifying diode must be fast enough to accommodate the changes
in the polarity of the electron oscillations in the antennas, which
is experimentally very challenging to achieve using conventional semiconductor-based
technologies. These key limitations can be circumvented in the CNT-based
rectenna design5−7 where each CNT acts as a receiving antenna and forms
a tunnel diode in contact with the transparent top electrode. Because
of the small contact area between CNT and the metal electrode, the
capacitance of this diode is very small. However, this may increase
the diode resistance resulting in a large impedance mismatch between
the diode and antenna. Therefore, further research is needed to improve
the diodes for better conversion efficiencies.7

Here, we study the possibility of enhancing current rectification
in CNT–metal junctions by altering the electronic properties
of CNTs through chemical doping. The latter has already been used
to create CNT-based p–n junction diodes operating at different
frequencies.13 A particular focus will
be given to surface fluorination14,15 since fluorinated
carbon structures are known by their chemical inertness and high thermal
stability.16,17 The analyses are based on the
computer simulations using density functional theory (DFT) in combination
with nonequilibrium Green’s functional formalism. We show that,
depending on the level of fluorination, more than an order of magnitude
larger rectification can be obtained. Transmission spectrum analysis
show that such large current rectification originates from bias-dependent
nanoscale charge localization in the system. We also study the effect
of substitutional doping using different dopants such as N, B, and
P. The effect of CNT morphology, such as radius, length, tip opening,
and chirality on the transport properties of the CNT–metal
systems is also studied. CNT–insulator–metal (CNT−I−M)
junctions are also studied as a reference to our doped systems. We
show that chemical doping (i.e., fluorination) has advantages over
the direct insulating layer deposition in terms of current rectification.

II Computational Method
Structural optimizations
and electronic structure calculations
are conducted using DFT within the generalized gradient approximation
of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) for the exchange-correlation
functional.18 The Brillouin zone is integrated
using the Monkhorst–Pack sampling method.19 van der Waals interactions are taken into account using
the Grimme’s empirical dispersion correction to PBE.20 The electronic structure is obtained self-consistently
within DFT/PBE, and the electrostatic potentials are defined on a
real-space grid with a mesh cutoff energy of 150 Ry. Double-zeta-polarized
basis sets of local numerical orbitals are used in the calculations.
The convergence criterion for Hellman–Feynman forces was 0.05
eV/Å. Electronic transport calculations are performed using the
nonequilibrium Green’s function formalism. The current–voltage
(I–V) characteristics are
calculated using the Landauer–Büttiker formula:21 1  where T(E,V) is the transmission spectrum for the
given value of voltage biasing (V), f(E,EF) is the Fermi–Dirac
distribution function, and μL/μR is the chemical potential of the left/right electrode. All the calculations
are conducted using the computational package Atomistix toolkit.22

From the calculated I–V curves, we have extracted diode figures
of merits (resistance, nonlinearity,
responsivity, and asymmetry) as: 2   3   4   5  where the asymmetry is defined
as the forward-to-reverse current ratio.

III Results and Discussions
A Effect of CNT Tip Opening
One of the
key factors limiting the solar conversion efficiency of CNT-based
rectennas is the large impedance mismatch between the antenna and
diode due to large electrical resistance of the CNT–I–M
diodes.5,6 As was shown in recent experiments, the
resistance of CNT–I–M diode arrays can be reduced significantly
by opening the tips of the multiwalled CNTs by, for example, plasma
etching.6 This is because of opening of
extra channels for electronic transport as the inner walls of multiwalled
CNTs also form contacts with the electrodes. In this section, we study
how the tip opening in single-walled CNT will affect the transport
properties of CNT–metal junctions.

As a representative
example, we consider single-walled armchair CNT(5,5) capped by a C60 hemisphere. Both closed-ended and open-ended CNTs are in
contact with 100 surfaces of silver. We first optimized these structures
with respect to the distance between the CNT and metal surface. For
the capped CNT, the minimum energy distance was found to be d = 2.2 Å. This distance becomes smaller (d = 1.8 Å) when the tip of CNT is open. Using these optimized
interface structures, we have constructed device geometries, each
of which consists of left and right regions (i.e., electrodes), which
are connected to a central region (i.e., two-probe configuration).
As shown in Figure 1a,b, the left electrode consists of the extension of CNT, and the
right electrode consists of silver atoms. The sizes of the electrodes
are 4.92 and 4.09 Å for left and right electrodes, respectively. Figure 2a shows the I–V curves of both samples calculated
using 1×1×100 k-point sampling. In both
cases, we have obtained a small asymmetry with reverse current being
larger than the forward one for the given value of the applied voltage.
However, the current in the system becomes more than 3 times larger
when the tip of CNT is opened (open-red circles in Figure 2a). Figure 2b shows the calculated differential resistance
of both samples. For the considered range of the applied bias, the
differential resistance of the system decreases at least 2 times due
to the tip opening. These results are in good qualitative agreement
with the recent experiments.6

Figure 1 Device geometries:
(a) capped- and (b) open-tip (5,5) CNTs in contact
with Ag(100) surface. Periodic boundary conditions are applied along
the x- and y-directions, and the
transport is calculated along the z-direction through
the metallic electrodes. Arrows show the transmission pathways at
the Fermi level.

and (b)
differential resistance of capped (solid-black circles) and open tip
(open-red circles) CNTs.

To understand the origin for the difference in
the electronic transport
in the considered systems, we have calculated transmission pathways
at different energy levels. As an example, we presented in Figure 1 the pathways for
electron transmission from the left to the right electrode for both
samples at the Fermi level. In these plots, the volume of each arrow
shows the magnitude of the local transmission between each pair of
atoms, whereas the arrow and the color indicate the direction of the
current (blue corresponds to the electron flow from left to right,
and red corresponds to the flow from right to left, i.e., scattered
electrons). In the case of the capped CNT, large scatterings of the
electrons are obtained from the tip of CNT (see Figure 1a). Consequently, the current in the system
reduces due to such electron back-scattering. On the contrary, we
did not observe such scattering in the open tip CNT (Figure 1b). This explains the enhanced
current in the open-tipped CNT geometries. We expect that this effect
will be even more pronounced in the case of multiwalled CNTs due to
the formation of extra channels for the charge carrier transport in
the system.

B Effect of an Insulating Layer
We start
with studying the electronic transport properties of the CNT–I–M
junction as a reference to our further calculations. Figure 3a shows our reference device,
which consists of metallic (i.e., armchair) CNT (3,3) connected to
the 100 surface of the silver electrode. No strain is applied to the
metal electrode during the interface formation because of the vacuum
region near CNT. As insulating layers, we have chosen HfO2(100) (Figure 3b)
and ZnO(100) (Figure 3c) layers. This is because HfO2 gives better rectification,
and ZnO results in better electronic transport among the other insulating
layers.6 Only insulating layers were strained
during the interface formation with the mean absolute strain values
0.69 and 1.44% for HfO2 and ZnO layers, respectively. In
both cases, the interface area was 133.5 Å2. During
the structural optimization, all the atoms of CNT are fully relaxed
and insulating, and metallic layers are optimized as rigid bodies.

and (b) with HfO2 and (c) ZnO layers.

Figure 4a shows
the I–V curves of the considered
systems for the voltage range from −2 to 2 V. Calculations
are conducted using 5×5×100 k-point sampling.
Introduction of the insulating layer decreases the current in the
system considerably for all considered voltage biases. To see how
the resistance changes in the presence of the insulating layer, we
plotted in Figure 4b the calculated differential resistance R as a
function of applied voltage. The insulating layers increase the resistance
of the system for all voltage values, except small bias range around
1.5 V. The HfO2 layer results in higher resistance as compared
to the ZnO layer, which is in good agreement with the recent experiments.6 To estimate the current rectification, we plotted
in Figure 4e the asymmetry
in the I–V curves as a function
of bias voltage. For the reference sample (solid-black circles), the
maximum rectification is obtained at 1.2 V voltage biasing and the
asymmetry is just 1.26. Current rectification increases up to 50%
when the ZnO layer is introduced (filled-green triangles). The current
rectification becomes more pronounced for the CNT–HfO2–Ag system (open-red circles): the asymmetry level increases
monotonically by increasing the applied voltage and becomes more than
3 at ΔV = 2 V. Figure 4c,d shows nonlinearity in the I–V curves and responsivity of the considered
systems. It is seen from these figures that these diode parameters
are also pronounced for the system with the HfO2-insulating
layer. These results are also in good qualitative agreement with the
recent experiments.6

layers: HfO2(100) (open-red circles) and ZnO(100) (solid-green
triangles).

C Effect of Substitutional Doping
We
start by considering the effect of substitutional doping on the charge
carrier transport through CNT–metal junctions. We use our CNT(3,3)–Ag(100)
system (see Figure 3a) as a reference to our further calculations. We start with considering
the systems where edge carbon atoms near the Ag(100) surface are substituted
by B, Be, N, Nb, and P atoms (see Figure 5 for the considered device geometries). Figure 6 shows the I–V curves (a) and asymmetry (b)
of the doped samples together with the results for the undoped sample
(solid-black circles). The largest forward-to-reverse current ratios
are obtained only for the N-doped system (open-blue squares in Figure 6b), whereas, for
all other dopants, the reverse current is larger than the forward
current. However, the current rectification (defined now as a ratio
of the reverse current to the forward one) is less than 1.7. We also
considered the case when more carbon atoms are replaced by N atoms
(see Figure 5d). In
this case, the rectification level increases only at larger bias voltages
(>1 V). The reverse current becomes larger at small voltages. Thus,
the substitutional doping does not provide better current rectification
as compared to CNT–I–M junctions (see Figure 4e). However, substitutionally
doped systems give a larger current as compared to CNT–I–M
samples. For example, the Nb-doped system (Figure 5e) shows a larger current even as compared
to the undoped (Figure 3a) system (compare solid-black circles and solid-magenta triangles
in Figure 6a).

CNT is substitutionally doped with different elements.

and with different substitutional doping.

D Effect of Fluorination
In this section,
we study the effect of fluorination of the tip area of CNT on the
quantum transport through the CNT–metal junction. We have chosen
fluorine atoms for the doping, knowing the fact that fluorine atoms
form strong covalent bonding with carbon atoms,16,17 which is necessary for the operational stability of the proposed
devices. Only the outer surface of CNT is fluorinated, which still
makes the charge transport more complex across the CNT–metal
junction due to the interplay of surface and bulk properties. The
optimized device geometries are shown in Figure 7 where the edge carbon atoms (i.e., first
carbon ring, Figure 7a), two (Figure 7b),
and four (Figure 7c)
carbon rings are fluorinated. For the sake of simplicity, we named
these systems as samples F1, F2, and F4 in the rest of the text.

Figure 7 CNT(3,3)–Ag(100)
device geometries with different levels
of fluorination: (a) first carbon ring, (b) two carbon rings, and
(c) four carbon rings.

Figure 8a shows
the I–V curves of all fluorinated samples
together with the results for the undoped system (solid-black circles).
The Brillouin zone was integrated using the 5×5×100 k-point mesh. The results show that the fluorination reduces
the current in the system and the value of the current depends on
the level of doping (notice that the current values are multiplied
by different factors in Figure 8a). The fluorinated samples indeed show larger resistance
as compared to the undoped system (see Figure 8b). However, the differential resistance
of the fluorinated samples reduces considerably starting from the
voltage bias ΔV > 0.5 V, which is not obtained
for the reference system. Despite such an increase in the resistance,
the fluorination results in dramatic enhancement of the rectification
effect in the system. For example, only the edge fluorination gives
the asymmetry level of more than 2 (see open-red circles in Figure 8e), whereas the maximum
forward-to-reverse current ratio does not exceed 26% in the case of
the undoped system (filled-black circles in Figure 8e). The rectification effect enhances further
with increasing the level of doping: the asymmetry becomes more than
an order of magnitude depending on the value of the applied bias (triangles
in Figure 8e). The
fluorinated samples also exhibit enhanced nonlinearity (Figure 8c) and responsivity (Figure 8c). Note that the
current rectification in the fluorinated samples is much larger as
compared to the CNT–insulator–metal junctions (compared Figures 4e and 8e).

Figure 8 (a) I–V curves, (b) differential
resistance, (c) nonlinearity, (d) responsivity, and (e) asymmetry
of CNT-Ag(100) system without (solid-black circles) with different
levels of fluorination. The current values in (a) are multiplied by
10, 100, and 100 for F1, F2, and F4 samples, respectively.

To understand the origin for the current rectification,
we analyze
the transmission spectra, device density of states (DDOS), and transmission
eigenvalues/eigenstates. Figure 9 shows the zero-bias DDOS (a) and transmission spectra
(b) of the reference system (see Figure 3a), the system with HfO2 (see Figure 3b), and for the F2
system. The reference and the fluorinated systems show very similar
DDOS, except several sharp peaks due to the contribution of the fluorine
atoms (compare black and blue curves in Figure 9a). However, these two systems show very
different transport properties. This is shown in Figure 9b where we plot the zero-bias
transmission spectra. In the case of the fluorinated system, the transmission
is strongly suppressed at electron energies below the Fermi level.
This reduced transmission is due to the nanoscale charge localization
(see panel 3 in Figure 9), which is not obtained in the other two systems (panels 1 and 2).
The presence of the insulating layer also reduces the electron transmission,
despite larger DDOS (see red curves in Figure 9a,b). For electron energies above the Fermi
level, the electronic states extend to the doped region, leading to
enhanced electron transmission. With an increase in the positive voltage
biasing, these nonzero transmission regions shift to the energy range
that covers the bias window (see the shaded and highlighted areas
in Figure 9c). Such
energy- and voltage-dependent transmission of the electrons is responsible
for the large current rectification in fluorinated systems.

spectra (b) as a function of electron energy (zero corresponds to

in constructing I–V characteristics. Panels
1–4 show the isosurface plots (isovalue 0.1) of the transmission
eigenstates corresponding to the electron energies indicated in (b).

E Effect of CNT Morphology
In this section,
we study the effects of length, radius, and chirality of CNT on the
obtained rectification behavior of fluorinated CNT–metal junctions.
We start with studying the effect of the CNT length on the electronic
transport properties of fluorinated-CNT–metal junctions. As
a typical example, we consider the F2–CNT system with the length
of the active layer of 21.05 Å (short sample, see the lower inset
in Figure 10 a) and
51.58 Å (long sample, see the upper inset in Figure 10a). The reference system will
be the one shown in Figure 7b with a layer length of 31.68 Å, the results for which
are shown in Figure 8. Figure 10 shows
the I–V curves (a) and asymmetry (b) of both
samples. It is seen from this figure that both samples give the same
current values for the reverse voltage biasing. Slightly larger current
values are obtained for the short sample only for the voltage values
(>0.6 V). The rectification ratio is also slightly larger for the
shorter sample. However, no qualitative changes are obtained in the
current voltage characteristics of the system by increasing the length
of CNT.

Figure 10 (a) I–V curves and (b) asymmetry of F2-CNT(3,3)–Ag(100)
samples with the length of
the active layer of 21.05 Å (solid-black curves) and 51.58 Å
(open-red circles). Insets show the device geometries.

Next, we study the effect of the CNT size on the
rectification
properties of the F2–CNT–metal junction. We use the
100 surface of silver as the right electrode material. Figure 11 shows the I–V curves (a) and asymmetry (b) for armchair
CNTs with size (2,2) (solid-black curves, panel 1), (4,4) (open-red
circles, panel 2), (5,5) (solid-green squares, pane 3), and (6,6)
(open-blue circles). It is seen from the I–V results that both voltage onsets for the finite current
in the system and value of the current for the given bias voltage
depends on the size of CNT. For example, the largest current for small
positive values of the voltage is obtained for the (2,2) CNT system.
With further increasing the positive voltage, the largest current
is generated in CNT with larger size. For negative biasing, the CNT(5,5)
system gives the largest current. However, regardless of the size
of the CNT, significant current rectification is obtained in all considered
systems (see Figure 11b). The smallest current rectification is obtained for CNT(5,5) (filled-green
squares), and the largest asymmetry is obtained for the CNT(6,6) system
(open-blue squares).

Figure 11 (a) I–V curves and (b) asymmetry
of F2–CNT–Ag(100)
system for the size of CNT(2,2) (panel 1), (4,4) (panel 2), (5,5)
(panel 3), and (6,6) (panel 4). Insets show the device geometries.

So far, we have considered armchair CNTs, which
have a metallic
nature. To see how the chirality of CNT affects the rectification
properties of CNT–metal junctions, we have conducted quantum
transport calculations for single-walled zig-zag CNTs with chiral
indices (n,n), which present a semiconducting
nature. Figure 12a
shows the I–V curves of fluorinated zig-zag
CNT–metal systems for different sizes of CNT and for the voltage
range from −2 to 2 V. There are two main differences in the I–V characteristics of these samples as compared
to the systems with armchair CNTs (compare Figures 11a and 12a). First,
the value of the current for a given voltage biasing is larger in
the case of zig-zag CNTs because of the smaller doping level. Second,
the reverse current is larger than the forward one. Therefore, the
rectification level (i.e., asymmetry) is in these systems defined
as the ration of the reverse current to the forward one. Figure 12b shows the asymmetry
for different sizes of the zig-zag CNTs. Significant current rectification
is also obtained for this type of CNTs with the largest asymmetry
for the CNT (8,8) system.

Figure 12 (a) I–V curves and
(b) asymmetry of zig-zag
CNT–Ag(100) system for the size of CNT (4,0) (panel 1), (5,0)
(panel 2), (6,0) (panel 3), and (8,0) (panel 4). Insets show the device
geometries.

Finally, we study quantum transport through the
double-walled CNT–metal
interface. As a typical example, we consider double-walled CNT consisting
of inner (3,3) CNT and outer (6,6) CNT (i.e., both CNTs have metallic
character) (see inset of Figure 13b). Figure 13a shows the I–V curve of the system
for the voltage range of −2 to 2 V. Current rectification is
clearly seen from this figure with forward current being larger than
the reverse current at larger voltage biasing. For the given level
of fluorination (see the inset of Figure 13b), the asymmetry of more than 3 is obtained
as shown in Figure 13b. Thus, current rectification can also be obtained due to fluorination
for the systems containing multiwalled CNTs.

CNT–Ag(100) system. Inset in (b) shows the device geometry.
The carbon atoms in the inner CNT are shown in red.

IV Conclusions
Using first-principle
density functional theory in combination
with Landauer–Büttiker formalism, we study the quantum
transport through CNT–metal interfaces. We start by considering
the case when an insulating layer is inserted between the CNT and
metal electrode. We obtained a clear current rectification where the
rectification level depends on the type of insulating layer. Enhanced
current rectification is obtained by fluorinating the outer surface
of CNTs, which originate from the bias-dependent charge localization
in the system. We also study the effect of CNT morphology (i.e., tip
opening, length, radius, and chirality) on the obtained results. These
results show the potential of chemical doping (i.e., fluorination)
as compared to direct evaporation of insulating layers in creating
higher rectifying diodes. The obtained nonlinear and asymmetric diode
behavior as well as low turn-on voltage can be beneficial for developing
CNT-based devices for high-frequency optoelectronic applications,
such as rectenna-based solar energy harvesting.
