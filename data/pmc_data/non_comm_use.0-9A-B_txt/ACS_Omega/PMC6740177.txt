The palm oil industry
produces large amounts of empty fruit bunches
(EFB) as waste. EFB are very recalcitrant toward further processing,
although their valorization could create novel incentives and bio-economic
opportunities for the industries involved. Herein, EFB have been successfully
subjected to the OrganoCat pretreatment—using 2,5-furandicarboxylic
acid as the biogenic catalyst—to fractionate and separate this
lignocellulosic material into its main components in a single step.
The pretreatment of EFB leads to the deacetylation and depolymerization
of noncellulosic polysaccharides and to the partial delignification
of the cellulosic fiber. The OrganoCat processing of EFB yielded 45
± 0.5 wt % cellulose-enriched pulp, 20 ± 0.7 wt % extracted
lignin, 3.8 ± 0.2 wt % furfural, and 11 ± 0.6 wt % hydrolyzed
sugars. The obtained EFB-pulp showed high accessibility to cellulases,
resulting in a glucan conversion of 73 ± 2% after 72 h (15 ±
2% after 1 h) with commercial cellulase cocktail (Accellerase 1500).
Overall, the results suggest that the treatment of the EFB material
using OrganoCat may create promising paths for the full valorization
of EFBs.

1 Introduction
Palm
oil has become an important raw material for the production
of food additives, for other nonedible bio-based materials like detergents,
lubricants, and so forth, also for biofuels. The biorefining of palm
oil, extraction, and upgrading, is thus well-established.1−3 However, the sustainability and life-cycle assessment of the palm
oil industry has been often challenged because of the replacement
of rain forests and other high biodiversity areas by large palm tree
plantations.4,5 On the other hand, the palm oil
production facilities—plantations and biorefining—represent
an important source for employment, (bio)economy, and assets for many
(sub)tropical areas. A compromise between development, ecosystem preservation,
and bioeconomy thus appears necessary. Recent studies have assessed
the actual available land for the sustainable development of palm
plantation for oil production by appraising several parameters such
as climate, soil quality (or lack of), topography of the area (“ease”
of cultivation), and accessibility of the land for logistics (e.g.,
penalizing “remote areas” because of higher costs).4 On that basis, sustainability criteria have been
set, concluding that up to 17% of the total potential arable land
(for palm trees) can be sustainably harvested for palm oil production,
accounting for 233 MHa worldwide.4 While
several areas would still have “sustainable room” for
further extension of the plantations, other regions have already exceeded
their potentially available sustainable land for palm trees. Hence,
for such regions, no further palm plantations should be established
in line with sustainability, bioeconomy, or biorefineries.4

By increasing the economic outcomes of
the already present palm
tree plantations, sustainability might be more properly targeted without
compromising the elimination of further biodiversity-rich areas that
must be preserved for future generations. An option is to holistically
valorize the byproducts, for example, lignocellulosic residues, that
are generated in a palm oil biorefinery. Thus, once palm kernels have
been harvested for palm oil production, the lignocellulosic residues—the
so-called empty fruit bunches (EFB)—, may be pretreated to
render lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose, broadening the benefits
for the palm tree biorefinery.1 EFB is
usually burned in incinerators of palm oil mills, which generates
energy, but also environmental pollution.6 Multiple approaches to process EFB have been proposed aiming for
different valorization strategies, for example, fuels,7,8 fibers,9,10 fermentable sugars,11−13 or even nutraceuticals.14,15 Moreover, residual lignin may be valorized as well.16

Depending on the envisaged product, different pretreatment
strategies
have been assessed for EFB, such as use of alkali,7,13,16−18 acid,13,18,19 hot water or steam,11,20 ionic liquids,21 or direct pyrolysis.10 In this work, the full valorization of EFB is
envisaged by successfully applying the OrganoCat technology22−25 (Figure 1), using
the biogenic acid 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) as the recyclable
catalyst. FDCA is being evaluated as the potential monomer for bio-based
plastic materials and is thus available in large quantities. In the
present context, FDCA offers advantages during its recovery and reuse,
as it is highly thermostable at the OrganoCat temperature operational
range (140–160 °C).25 Furthermore,
the combination of a biogenic pretreatment involving FDCA and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran
(MTHF) with the valorization of EFB may lead to strong synergies,
leading researchers to pursue activities with environmental and economic
benefits.

Figure 1 Conceptual approach of the OrganoCat process,22−24 using water
and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF) as a biphasic solvent system
involving FDCA as the biogenic catalyst.25

Albeit the current price of FDCA
is still high, Dessbesell et al.
have recently described synthetic pathways that may hold potential
to decrease FDCA market prices down to 1.8 US$ kg–1, for example, when produced from high-fructose corn syrup.26 Moreover, the recyclability of FDCA as the catalyst
in OrganoCat has been successfully shown by Weidener et al., showcasing
the quantitative recovery of the acid.25 Thus, upon optimization, FDCA may become an economically viable
catalyst for pretreatment processes and for other biorefinery-based
conversions.

The OrganoCat concept has shown to be effective
at high biomass
loadings—up to 400 g L–1—, and preliminary
economic assessments are promising.24 A
range of plant materials have been successfully pretreated by this
process, such as beech wood,22−25 mate tea, phragmites, rice,24,27 or biomass from energy plants like Sida, Miscanthus, Szarvasi, and Silphium.28 The obtained lignin and cellulosic fractions are delivered
without major degradation because of mild processing conditions. The
resulting fractions can be used for further chemical or biotechnological
processing to deliver novel materials with high (bio)economic impact.
In this respect, the application of OrganoCat to EFB holds potential
to enable novel synergies and a higher value generation in palm oil
biorefineries. Moreover, the used solvent (2-MTHF) and catalyst (FDCA)
are potentially biogenic, and thus could be synthetized in biorefineries
directly in-house.

2 Results and Discussion
Using multiscale analytics including chemical, spectroscopic, and
enzymatic methods, the composition of the original EFB lignocellulosic
material and the composition of the fractions obtained from OrganoCat
were characterized in detail. An overview of different components
measured before and after the treatment is depicted in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Analysis of EFB samples
before and after applying the OrganoCat
pretreatment. The material was dried until constant weight before
analysis. Left bars show the initial composition of EFB raw material;
right bars show the composition of fractions obtained; hydrolyzed
hemicelluloses and acetic acid detected in the aqueous fraction are
grouped as “OrganoCat aqueous fraction”; products, obtained
in the 2-MTHF phase are labeled as “OrganoCat-organic (org.)
fraction”; the label “EFB-OrganoCat pulp” shows
the composition in cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin content. N.d.—not
determined. ASR—alcohol insoluble residue. * Weight loss due
to pretreatment/extraction with EtOH/MeOH/chloroform (removing alcohol
soluble residue, ASR) and enzymatic destarching (removing starch).

As depicted in Figure 2 (left column), the composition of EFB raw
material accounts
for a 31.9 ± 0.3 wt % of cellulose, 18.2 ± 0.5 wt % of lignin,
and 14.8 ± 1.2 wt % of hemicelluloses. Starch and ASR were extracted
prior to the analysis with ethanol, methanol, and chloroform to remove
lipids, pigments and other small molecules, followed by an enzyme
cocktail containing amylase and amylopectinase to remove specifically
starch (9.2 ± 0.1 wt % in total). In addition, EFB also contained
6.0 ± 0.3 wt % acetyl groups and some nondetermined material,
which include residual moisture (6.6–12%) and ashes (1.7–3.4%).29−31 Gratifyingly, the OrganoCat process enabled the selective depolymerization
of most hemicelluloses resulting in different sugar monomers in the
aqueous fraction (10.8 ± 0.6 wt %, Figure 2, right column). Moreover, the remaining
OrganoCat pulp contained mainly cellulose, 28.5 ± 1.0 wt %, with
some remaining lignin (4.9 ± 0.3 wt %) and entrapped hemicellulose
(2.3 ± 0.1 wt %). The organic phase contained mainly lignin (19.5
± 0.7 wt %) with low amounts of furfural (3.8 ± 0.2 wt %)
formed during the dehydration of xylose during the pretreatment. Some
of the compounds found in the ASR-fraction are expected to be extracted
in the OrganoCat organic fraction. Nondetermined material after the
OrganoCat process include residual moisture and ashes, derived from
the raw material.29−31

To calculate the acetic acid release, the degree
of O-acetylation in EFB raw material and in the pulp
was measured as
well as free acetic acid in the hydrolysate. The degree of acetylation
decreased from 6.0 ± 0.3 wt % in the raw material to 1.1 ±
0.2 wt % in the OrganoCat pulp material. This is in line with the
measured acetic acid content in the hydrolysate (5.2 ± 0.1 wt
%) and consistent with other works.11 Regarding
xylan, O-acetylation changes from 63 ± 2 mol
% in the raw material to 26 ± 4 mol % in the OrganoCat pulp.
Acetate in the solid material originates from the hemicellulose xylan,
where it is esterified at the O-2, O-3, and/or O-2,3 position, or
from lignin, which may be γ-acetylated.32 Here, the position of the O-acetyl substituent
on xylan was assessed. In the raw material, acetylation in the 2-position,
3-position, and 2,3-position was 15 ± 2, 40 ± 1, and 8 ±
1 mol %, respectively, whereas in the pulp, the numbers were 10 ±
1, 12 ± 1, and 4 ± 2 mol %, respectively. This suggests
that O-acetates in the 3-position on xylan were deacetylated
at a higher rate (O-acetylation reduced by 69%) than
in the 2-position (O-acetylation reduced by 34%)
or in the 2,3-position (reduced by 48%). Thus, the OrganoCat pretreatment
(with FDCA) leads to a major reduction in polymer O-acetylation. Based on the amount of xylan present in the EFB material
and the degree of acetylation of xylan, the majority of acetyl groups
released during the OrganoCat process are derived from xylan, as also
described for angiosperm trees by Lu et al.32 The reduction in hemicellulose acetylation is known to improve cellulose
hydrolysis, enhancing subsequent valorization steps.29,33

With respect to the hemicellulose fraction, a detailed analysis
of the sugar monomers found in the aqueous phase was conducted (Figure 3). For comparison,
the monosaccharide composition present in the raw material and in
the pulp are depicted as well.

Figure 3 Monosaccharide composition of hemicelluloses
in the raw material
(blue bars), residual hemicelluloses in the cellulose-enriched OrganoCat
pulp (grey bars) and in the aqueous OrganoCat hydrolysate (orange
bars) present in wt %. Hemicelluloses of raw material and OrganoCat
Pulp were hydrolyzed into their monosaccharides with trifluoroacetic
acid.34 In the OrganoCat hydrolysate, the
monosaccharides were detected after removal of the catalyst FDCA.

The most common sugar present in EFB raw material
hemicellulose
is xylose (Figure 3, blue bars). Consistent with the previous literature22−25 this is mostly due to the presence of the hemicellulose xylan, which
is hydrolyzed by the OrganoCat process, as can be observed in the
OrganoCat hydrolysate (Figure 3, orange bars). However, the solid product stream (Figure 3, grey bars)—the
cellulose enriched OrganoCat Pulp—contained some residual hemicellulosic
sugars. Here, a set of OrganoCat parameters was chosen to avoid degradation
of the OrganoCat fractions. A fine-tuning strategy of the OrganoCat,
specifically adapted to the envisaged application, might improve the
solubilization of hemicelluloses and lignin but might cause higher
content in sugar degradation products such as furfural.25

Lignin makes up a significant part of
EFB raw material. After the
OrganoCat pretreatment, the extracted components were isolated from
the organic phase upon evaporation of 2-MTHF, leading to a yield of
18.2 ± 0.5 wt % of the initial biomass weight, containing mostly
lignin and presumably some pigments and lipids (ASR). Based on the
data, approx. 73% of the initial lignin content in the raw material
was extracted from the biomass and recovered in the organic phase
as a novel raw material from EFB. Figure 4 depicts the ratio of lignin monomers—p-hydroxyphenyl group (H), guaiacyl group (G), and syringyl
group (S)—and the relative amount of β-O-4-linkages. Here, it has been analyzed in detail (Figure 4) to give a thorough characterization
of the changes occurring during pretreatment.

Figure 4 NMR-analysis of lignin
fraction in EFB raw material, OrganoCat
Pulp and OrganoCat Organic Fraction. Amounts of p-hydroxyphenyl (H-), guaiacyl (G-), syringyl (S-) groups are given
per 100 units. The blue bars indicate how many H-, G-, and S-groups
are connected via β-O-4 linkage.

The H/G/S ratio of the raw material was 3:43:54 (resulting
in a
ratio of 1:12.6:16) and the S/G ratio 1.27, which is more comparable
to lignin from grasses such as rye or wheat straw35 than lignin from beech wood or other sources.36 H-unit overestimation in the whole material,
and the lignin fraction discussed below, is probably produced because
of the presence of p-hydroxybenzoic acid acylating
palm lignin at the gamma position. In the raw material, 53 ±
3 mol % of the monomers are connected by a β-O-4-linkage, which only changes slightly in the OrganoCat pulp after
processing (48 ± 3 mol %). The extracted OrganoCat lignin, however,
shows a significant decrease in β-O-4-linkages,
resulting in 24 ± 1 mol % of the S- G- and H-groups being connected
by a β-O-4-linkage. In addition, the number
of H-groups rises from 3.4 ± 0.3 mol % in the raw material to
11.7 ± 1.0 mol % in the extracted lignin suggesting that extracted
lignin reacts further during the OrganoCat treatment. This observed
change in H-units might be caused partially by conversion of S- and
G-units to H-units and also by the liberation of p-hydroxybenzoic acid from acylated γ-hydroxyls of lignin side-chains,
as described by Lu et al.32 The changes
of lignin during the OrganoCat process have been observed to be time-dependent,
and thus, at shorter reaction times (up to 1 h pretreatment), lignins
with a higher amount of β-O-4-linkages can
be obtained, enabling the generation of different materials depending
on the final application.25 A trade-off
in lignin yield and (higher) proportion of β-O-4-linkages could be thus reached in line with the emerging concepts
of “Lignin-first” biorefineries.37−39

With
respect to the EFB-pulp, visual differences compared to the
raw material were observed (Figure 5). During the OrganoCat process, lignin is not only
extracted into the OrganoCat org. fraction, but some of the remaining
lignin also relocates by absorbing to the OrganoCat pulp surface.
Thus, the partially delignified material appears to be of a darker
color than the untreated raw material as observed also in other biomasses.22−25 The processiblity of the EFB-cellulose pulp was assessed by determining
the glucose yield upon enzymatic digestion. Here, an industrial, commercially
available enzyme mix was used (Accellerase 1500, Figure 6).

Figure 5 Visual changes along
the OrganoCat process. (a) Original EFB raw
material (b) obtained EFB OrganoCat pulp.

Figure 6 Enzymatic
hydrolysis of EFB raw material (blue dots), OrganoCat
pulp obtained from EFB after the OrganoCat process (orange dots).
For comparative purposes, commercial crystalline cellulose (Avicel,
grey dots) was used. Glucose yields were calculated based on the cellulose
content of each sample.

The OrganoCat process
increases the glucose yield after 72 h (orange
dots) 8-fold compared to the original raw EFBs (blue dots), indicating
a superior depolymerization of the cellulose fibers in the residue.
The achieved maximal conversion rate (∼73%) is somewhat lower
than values observed in other studies using pretreated materials (up
to 80%).13,17 This may be due to the residual lignin still
present in the pulp (Figure 2) or due to the use of cellulase cocktails with different
bias toward polysaccharides (e.g., more or less effective enzymes).
In any case, higher conversion rates may also be achieved by tailoring
OrganoCat process conditions to further enhance delignification25 as well as by designing new cellulase variants
or enzyme cocktail mixtures with higher selectivity to EFB raw material
properties.

3 Conclusions
The successful proof-of-concept
of the OrganoCat pretreatment applied
to EFB has been shown and was characterized in-depth. The approach
enables the production of soluble sugars (mostly xylose), soluble
lignin (e.g., in EtOH, 2-MTHF, acetone, DMSO), and a solid cellulose-enriched
pulp. Because of significant delignification and deacetylation, the
obtained pulp is highly accessible to cellulases for its hydrolysis
to glucose as fermentable sugars. Overall, the OrganoCat pretreatment
renders three different fractions of the EFB lignocellulosic materials
with potential valorization in palm tree biorefineries. Thus, treating
the waste material EFB with the OrganoCat process may contribute to
open additional commercial options of the palm oil industry.

4 Experimental Part
4.1 Materials and Methods
All chemicals
were purchased at Sigma-Aldrich, Carl Roth, and CGI. They were used
without further modification. Empty fruit bunches (EFB) from a palm
oil plantation in Sabah (Borneo/Malaysia) were kindly supplied by
Autodisplay Biotech GmbH, Düsseldorf. The material was dried
in an oven at 50 °C until constant weight (24 h).

4.2 OrganoCat Pretreatment
Reactions
were conducted in triplicates. In a 300 mL Parr high pressure reactor,
with glass inlay 3000 mg EFB and 468 mg (3 mmol) of FDCA were suspended
in 30 mL ultra-pure water and 30 mL 2-MTHF. The reactor was closed
and heated to 160 °C for 3 h. After cooling the reactor to room
temperature, the reactor was opened, the liquid phases were separated
by decantation and the aqueous phase was filtered to isolate the cellulose
enriched pulp. The sugar concentrations were determined in the aqueous
phase via IC and HPLC. The solid residue was washed with distilled
water until neutral pH and dried until constant weight. Lignin was
obtained by evaporation of 2-MTHF. The amount of residual FDCA and
furfural in the lignin was determined via 1H NMR using
mesitylene as the standard.

4.3 Lignocellulose Analysis
Every analysis
was conducted in triplicates. EFB raw material was chopped into slices
of approx. 1 cm and subsequently grinded to fine powder using a ball
mill M 400 (Retsch, Haan, Germany) in a 50 mL metal beaker (30 s–1, 2 min). Alcohol insoluble residues (AIR) were prepared
and destarched as described elsewhere.34 The weight loss during the procedure including removal of starch
was calculated and is defined as ASR and starch. The remaining destarched
alcohol-insoluble residues (d-AIR) were used for the subsequent analysis
of noncellulosic polysaccharide composition, crystalline cellulose
content, and acetyl bromide soluble lignin (ABSL) as previously described.34 The acetate content of d-AIR was determined
using an acetic acid kit (catalog #K-ACETRM, Megazyme, Wicklow, Ireland),
following an adapted version of the procedure described by Schultink
et al.40 AIR material (2 mg) was mixed
with 200 μL water and saponified by addition of 200 μL
1 M NaOH. Samples were incubated at 25 °C with 600 rpm shaking
frequency, followed by neutralization with 200 μL 1 M HCl. The
material was pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 14 000
rpm and the total acetic acid content of the supernatant was determined
with the acetic acid kit.

4.4 Analysis of OrganoCat Product
Streams
Every analysis was conducted in triplicates. The
obtained aqueous
fraction was cleared from FDCA via precipitation at 5 °C and
subsequently analyzed by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography
with pulsed amperometric detection to determine the monosaccharide
yield, as described elsewhere.28

4.5 Saccharification Test
Every reaction
was conducted in triplicates. Hydrolysis of raw material, Avicel,
and OrganoCat pulp obtained from the OrganoCat pretreatment was carried
out in an Eppendorf ThermoMixer Comfort using 1.5 mL Eppendorf vials.
For each reaction, 20 mg of pulp and 10 μL Accellerase 1500
(60 FPU mL–1 and 82 CBU mL–1,
Genencor, the Netherlands) were dissolved in 1 mL of citrate buffer
(pH = 4.5) and shaken at 50 °C for a specific time. Afterward,
samples were heated to 90 °C for 10 min. The glucose concentration
was determined using a glucose (HK) assay kit obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
and a BioTek PowerWave HT UV–vis spectrometer. Glucose yields
were calculated based on cellulose content as determined in the lignocellulose
compositional analysis.

4.6 NMR Analysis
Measurements
of OrganoCat
lignin were conducted with a Bruker Ascend 400 (400 MHz) spectrometer.
Dried lignin (approx. 100 mg) was dissolved in DMSO-d6. 1H–13C-Heteronuclear single
quantum coherence (HSQC) measurements were performed to identify different
linkages present in the lignin. Mesitylene was used as an internal
standard to quantify furfural and 5-HMF in the extracted lignin fraction.

Analysis of EFB raw materials and pulp samples (3 replicates each):

For the NMR analysis, EFB raw biomass was destarched. The destarched
raw biomass and OrganoCat produced pulp materials were milled separately
using a Retsch PM 100 CM ball mill, as described previously.41 The above ball-milled material (25 mg) was dissolved
in 0.75 mL of deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO-d6 containing 10 μL of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
acetate (EMIM(OAC)) and stirred for 2 h at 60 °C. Two dimensional
(2D) 13C–1H HSQC nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectra were measured on a 600 MHz Bruker NMR spectrometer using
the following parameters. Experimental conditions: pulse program:
hsqcetgpsisp.2, NS: 384, interscan delay: 1 s, TD1: 2048 and TD2:
256 data points, temperature: 25 °C. The chemical shifts were
referred to the solvent DMSO-d6 peak (δH 2.49 ppm, δC 39.5 ppm). The 13C–1H cross peaks were identified and quantified
as described.41
