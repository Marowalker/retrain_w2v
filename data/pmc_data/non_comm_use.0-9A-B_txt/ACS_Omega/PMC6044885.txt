Seafloor
massive sulfide deposits have attracted much interest
as mineral resources. Therefore, the potential environmental impacts
of full-scale mining should be considered. In this study, we focused
on metal and metalloid contamination that could be triggered by accidental
leakage and dispersion of hydrothermal ore particulates from mining
vessels into surface seawater. We determined the leaching potential
of metals and metalloids from four hydrothermal ores collected from
the Okinawa Trough into aerobic seawater and then evaluated the toxic
effects of ore leachates on a phytoplankton species, Skeletonema marinoi–dohrnii complex, which is present ubiquitously in the ocean. Large amounts
of metals and metalloids were released from the ground hydrothermal
ores into seawater within 5 min under aerobic conditions. The main
components of leachates were Zn + Pb, As + Sb, and Zn + Cu, which
were obtained from the Fe–Zn–Pb-rich and Zn–Pb-rich
zero-age, Ba-rich, and Fe-rich ores, respectively. The leachates had
different chemical compositions from those of the ore. The rapid release
and difference in chemical compositions between the leachates and
the ores indicated that substances were not directly dissolved from
the sulfide-binding mineral phase but from labile phases mainly on
the adsorption–desorption interface of the ores under these
conditions. All ore leachates inhibited the growth of S. marinoi–dohrnii complex but with different magnitudes of toxic effects. These results
indicate that the fine particulate matter of hydrothermal ores is
a potential source of toxic contamination that may damage primary
production in the ocean. Therefore, we insist on the necessity for
the prior evaluation of toxic element leachability from mineral ores
into seawater to minimize mining impacts on the surface environment.

1 Introduction
Seafloor
massive sulfide (SMS) deposits have attracted interest
because of their potential as available mineral resources. However,
seafloor metal-mining could create new problems in the marine environment
and could have serious consequences for marine ecosystems.1,2 One of these problems is the potential for metal and metalloid contamination,
as metals are easily introduced into ecosystems where they gradually
accumulate in the bodies of living organisms.3,4

It has been postulated that plumes of fine particulate minerals
that arise during mining operations could be a major source of metal
and metalloid contamination.2,5 Such plumes are generated
in the benthic zone as a result of drilling ore minerals and stripping
unconsolidated sediment from the seafloor surface and in the epipelagic
zone as a result of leakage of crushed ore from mining vessels. Plumes
of fine particulate minerals in the epipelagic zone could damage marine
phytoplankton communities at the base of the marine food chain.5−8 Therefore, the mobility of these metals and metalloids in hydrothermal
ores should be evaluated to predict the quantitative impacts of seafloor
metal-mining on marine ecosystems.

Various types of ore deposits
are present in submarine hydrothermal
fields.9−11 For example, Halbach et al. (1993) found that the
hydrothermal ore in the hydrothermal field of Izena Hole, Okinawa
Trough, had various chemical compositions and mineral assemblages,
including Zn–Pb-rich sulfide ore, Ba–Zn–Pb sulfide
ore, massive Zn–Cu-rich sulfide slabs, Fe-rich replacement
ore, and Zn–Pb-rich impregnation ore.9 These chemical compositions and mineral assemblages depend on the
geological setting and fluid chemistry. The chemical compositions
of leachates are expected to differ among different types of hydrothermal
ores.

Simpson et al. (2007) studied the leachability of metals
and metalloids
from hydrothermal mineral ores collected from both active and inactive
vent chimneys in the East Manus Basin hydrothermal field (Papua New
Guinea) as part of the Solwara 1 project.8 They observed that large amounts of Mn, Cu, Zn, and As and small
amounts of Ni, Ag, Cd, and Pb were rapidly released into oxic seawater
from these mineral ore samples. However, they did not take into account
the relationship between the chemical composition of the leachates
and those of the hydrothermal ores.

In this study, we investigated
the leachability of metals and metalloids
from fine particulates of various hydrothermal ores collected in the
Okinawa Trough. These ore samples had different chemical compositions
and mineral assemblages. As well as the potential for leaching, we
also determined the toxicity of the leachates to a marine phytoplankton, Skeletonema marinoi–dohrnii complex (formerly classified into Skeletonema costatum,12,13 one of the ecotoxicological standard test
organisms used to evaluate seawater quality).7,14 On
the basis of our results, we discuss the possibility of metal and
metalloid contamination through the dispersion of hydrothermal ores
into the surface layer and their potential effects on marine phytoplankton
primary production. These are important potential issues related to
seafloor metal-mining.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Release of Metals and Metalloids from Mineral
Ore Particulates
The leachates contained large amounts of
Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Sb, and Pb (Table 1). The leachates from all ore samples commonly
contained Zn and Mn, whereas Cd was detected from all leachates except
that from the Ba-rich ore (HPD1313G05). The Fe–Zn–Pb-rich
(HPD1313G04) and the Zn–Pb-rich zero-age (HPD1355R04) ores
released Pb. Only the Ba-rich ore released As and Sb.

Among
all leached metals and metalloids, Zn showed the highest
concentrations in most of the leachates produced under these experimental
conditions. The Zn concentration was higher in the leachate from the
Fe-rich ore (HPD1311G06) than in the leachates from the Fe–Zn–Pb-rich,
Ba-rich, and Zn–Pb-rich ores.

In hydrothermal ores, Zn
is generally present as a monosulfide
mineral, sphalerite.15 Small amounts of
Mn and Cd are present in sphalerite as impurities;16 consequently, the amounts of Mn and Cd in the ores were
positively correlated with that of Zn (Figure S1a). As expected, the concentrations of Mn and Cd in the leachates
were also positively correlated with that of Zn (Figure S1b). These findings indicate that sphalerite in the
ores was the main source of Zn and also of Mn and Cd.

Figure 1 shows the
leaching ratios of each metal and metalloid from the solid ore samples.
The leaching ratios of Mn and Zn from Ba-rich and Fe-rich ores were
significantly high, even though sphalerite was not found in Ba-rich
and Fe-rich ores (Table 2). However, the leaching ratios of Mn, Zn, and Cd were significantly
low in the leachates from the Zn–Pb-rich and the Fe–Zn–Pb-rich
zero-age ores, which contained large proportions of sphalerite. Such
different leaching ratios from different types of ores might imply
that metal leaching under these experimental conditions was not because
of direct dissolution from sphalerite. The other major minerals in
the ore samples such as pyrite (an Fe sulfide mineral) in the Fe-rich
ore and chalcopyrite (a Cu–Fe sulfide mineral) in the Zn–Pb-rich
zero-age ore showed similar leaching characteristics. We did not detect
Fe in the leachate from the Fe-rich ore containing pyrite, nor did
we detect Cu from the Zn–Pb-rich zero-age ore containing chalcopyrite.

In general, sulfide minerals such as sphalerite, pyrite,
and chalcopyrite
frequently found in hydrothermal ores react with water and oxygen
and release the metal ion and sulfate, as per the following equation17 (where M is a divalent metal)  

This oxidation reaction
could be accelerated under aerobic water
conditions, but the reaction rates are very slow.18,19 The low leaching ratios from our sulfide mineral samples also indicate
that the rate of such reactions is very slow. Consequently, direct
dissolution of these metals from sulfide minerals would make only
a minor contribution to the dissolved metals in the leachates.

Desorption is another mechanism for the intense release of metals
and metalloids from ores. Desorption releases metals from sulfide
minerals significantly faster than direct dissolution because the
binding strength of metals in adsorption states is significantly weaker
than that of metals in sulfide mineral states.20,21 Under our experimental conditions, large amounts of metals and metalloids
were released within 5 min of shaking (Table 1a), and their concentrations in leachates
showed little change after 6 or 18 h of shaking. These results indicated
that desorption greatly contributed to the release of metals from
the ores into the solution.

In our experiment, the pH values
of leachates from the Fe–Zn–Pb-rich,
the Ba-rich, the Fe-rich, and the Zn–Pb-rich zero-age ores
decreased to 4.3, 6.8, 4.8, and 6.7, respectively, after shaking for
5 min. Such rapid decreases in pH suggest that sulfide minerals had
been oxidized, sulfuric acids had formed, and metals had been protonated
on the surface of ores before our experiment, that is, during sample
storage (deprotonation of weak acids, e.g., H2S and H2SO3, and hydrolysis of heavy metal ions, e.g.,
Fe3+ might also lead to decreased pH). The protonated metal
ions would be adsorbed onto deoxidized sulfides22 and other secondary minerals such as hydroxide mineral
surfaces23,24 by the formation of weak chemical bonds.

Adsorbed metal ions are easily desorbed via an ion exchange reaction
involving hydrogen ions, as follows17 (where
≡ indicates the mineral surface)  

Studies on the ion exchange
reaction on the surface of hydrous
PbS and ZnS have concluded that significant amounts of Pb and Zn can
be released into solution via this reaction.25,26 The metal sulfide surface exhibits acid/base properties after hydration,
and the metal ion is replaced by a highly reactive hydrogen ion. The
result of this reaction is that metals adsorbed onto the mineral surface
are easily and rapidly released (desorbed) into the solution. The
ion exchange reaction occurs at pH values between 4 and 7.17 The pH values of leachates in this study were
4.3–6.8. Therefore, we conclude that the process of ion exchange
contributed to the rapid release of metals from the ores.

On
the basis of the experimental evidence and the reactions shown
above, most of the metals and metalloids in the leachates could not
be directly dissolved from sulfide minerals in the ore during the
short shaking time but would have been released via desorption reactions
such as ion exchange.

2.2 Effect of Ore Leachates
on Marine Phytoplankton
Figure 2 shows the
changes in the fluorescence of S. marinoi–dohrnii complex over time
in different treatments. In this experiment, the algae were grown
in multiwell plates. The fluorescence in the control wells showed
relatively stable increases over time, reflecting the increase in
cell density. Compared with control wells, those containing leachates
at a concentration of less than 0.1% showed no obvious inhibition
effects on diatom growth. We constructed dose–inhibition curves
using the relative growth rate, which was calculated by normalizing
the raw growth rates of each exposure well to that of the control
well (Figure 3). In
wells containing leachates at concentrations > 0.1%, the inhibition
effects were demonstrable (Figures 2 and 3). In some cases (medium
containing 10% Ba-rich, 0.5 and 1% Fe-rich, and 4% Zn–Pb-rich
zero-age ores), the fluorescence intensities of the wells gradually
and almost monotonously decreased during the experiment, implying
that there was strong growth inhibition and either cell death or decomposition
of the chlorophyll pigments (Figure 2). We note here that the relative growth rates were
shown as zero in Figure 3 when negative changes in the fluorescence were recorded (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Effect of different leachate
concentrations on the growth of Skeletonema marinoi–dohrnii complex. (a) Ba-rich
ore (HPD1313G05), (b) Fe-rich ore (HPD1311G06),
and (c) Zn–Pb-rich zero-age ore (HPD1355R04).

Figure 3 Relative growth rates (μ) of Skeletonema
marinoi–dohrnii complex after addition
of ore leachates. Leachate concentrations: 0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, and 10%
for Ba-rich ore (HPD1313G05); 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1% for
Fe-rich ore (HPD1311G06); and 0.01, 0.1, 1, 2.5, 4, and 5% for Zn–Pb-rich
zero-age ore (HPD1355R04).

The leachate from the Fe-rich ore was the most toxic to S. marinoi–dohrnii complex (Figure 3) and was lethal at concentrations below 1%. The leachate from the
Zn–Pb-rich zero-age ore showed medium toxicity, but its toxicity
increased markedly at concentrations higher than 4%. The leachate
from Ba-rich ores also inhibited the growth of S. marinoi–dohrnii complex, and its inhibitory
effect grew stronger with increasing concentrations.

Metals
and metalloids in the leachates would contribute to the
growth inhibition of S. marinoi–dohrnii complex, although the specific toxicants
inhibiting growth have not been identified in this study. The half-maximal
inhibition concentrations of metals and metalloids on Skeletonema costatum reported in previous studies
are as follows: Zn, 2.2 μM; Cd, 1.2 μM; Pb, 0.094 μM;27 Cu, 0.42 μM;28 As, 0.17 μM;29 and Sb, >34 μM.30 The results of these studies indicated that
Pb, Cu, and As are more toxic to S.costatum than Zn, Cd, and Sb. In the present study,
the cell death for S. marinoi–dohrnii complex occurred when the following toxic
elements were present at high concentrations in the culture medium:
Pb (35.4 μM) in the leachate from the Zn–Pb-rich zero-age
ores, Cu (5.9 μM) in the leachate from the Fe-rich ores, and
As (45.9 μM) in the leachate from the Ba-rich ores. Therefore,
these elements that leached from the ores inhibit the growth of S. marinoi–dohrnii complex.

Addition of the leachates from Fe-rich and Zn–Pb-rich
ores
to culture media (Daigo IMK medium) resulted in a decrease in pH from
8.5 to 7.1 and 7.7, respectively. Taraldsvik and Myklestad (2000)
determined the effects of pH on the growth rate of S. costatum and found no significant difference in
the growth rates at pH values 6.5–8.5.31 In this study, therefore, the growth of S. marinoi–dohrnii complex was more likely
inhibited by the metals and metalloids in the leachates than by changes
in the pH of the growth medium.

The present study was conducted
with S. marinoi–dohrnii complex, one of the
suitable phytoplanktons as an ecotoxicological model organism, to
evaluate the toxic effects of ore leachates. It should be noted that
similar experimental surveys targeting representative species in open
oceans might be necessary to resolve ecological impact on the primary
production and biodiversity for future studies.

2.3 Importance for Environmental Impact Assessment
of Seafloor Metal-Mining Using Leaching Test
Evaluations
of the leachability of metals and metalloids from ore particulates
into seawater and their toxicity to marine organisms are important
to design practical mining plans and processes that minimize the impacts
of seafloor metal-mining on marine environments.

Recently, Simpson
and Spadaro (2016) have also suggested the necessity to evaluate the
potential toxicity of leachates from sulfide minerals. They demonstrated
that Zn, Pb, and Cu were released from the reference materials of
sphalerite, galena, and chalcopyrite particulates, respectively, and
showed that these metals in ionic forms in solution were toxic to
marine benthic invertebrates (bivalve and juvenile amphipods) commonly
found on the seafloor of deep oceans.2

Our study demonstrated the potential leachability of metals and
metalloids not from reference materials but from natural hydrothermal
ores, and their toxicity to marine phytoplankton commonly found in
the surface environment. A crucial finding in this study is that the
chemical composition and concentrations of the leachates cannot be
easily predicted by those of the ores. Therefore, bulk analysis of
ores is insufficient. Instead, leaching tests are essential to predict
the potential release of metals and metalloids from hydrothermal ores
for seafloor metal-mining, as is the case for land-mining wastes and
contaminated sediments.32,33

Metal and metalloid
sulfide minerals are under anoxic conditions
when hydrothermal ores are left undisturbed on the seafloor. However,
the sulfide minerals on the surface of the hydrothermal ore samples
used in this study would have been oxidized by air, and metals and
metalloids would have transformed into labile states during sample
storage. This is one reason why large amounts of metals and metalloids
were released into the leachate solutions.

In the SMS-mining
model proposed by several contractors such as
Nautilus Minerals Ltd. and Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation
(JOGMEC), mineral ores are crushed using a seafloor mining tool, raised
from the seafloor through a riser pipe, and then stored on a mining
support vessel.34−36 On the vessel, the sulfide minerals will gradually
be oxidized by exposure to air and rain water. Their transformation
into leachable phases during storage means that they will release
toxic metals and metalloids if they are released into seawater.

There may be low dissolution of metals and metalloids from anoxic
(fresh) ores than from oxidized ores; however, the evaluation of leaching
potential from oxidized hydrothermal ores is important for thorough
marine environmental impact assessments. Therefore, our results provide
reference values for the maximum amounts of metals and metalloids
that might be leached when hydrothermal minerals are oxidized and
accidentally spilled into the surface environment.

3 Conclusions
We showed that metals and metalloids were rapidly
released from
oxidized hydrothermal ores with different leachabilities. It is natural
that different ores have different leachabilities. However, our results
also showed that the compositions of the leachates did not completely
reflect the chemical compositions and concentrations of the ores and
that the different leachates had different degrees of toxicity to
the test phytoplankton. These results suggest that analyses of the
bulk chemical composition of ores will not provide enough information
to predict the potential release of metal and metalloids in the surface
layer. For more accurate predictions, ores should be subjected to
leaching tests as well as chemical analyses, as performed in this
study.

The possible environmental risks of full-scale seafloor
mining
and the measures to mitigate these risks are still under discussion.
One environmental risk is the metal contamination and its adverse
effects on the marine ecosystem. The results of our study will be
useful for future predictions of environmental impacts of mining on
the surface environment.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Hydrothermal Mineral Samples
The
four hydrothermal ore samples (HPD1313G04, HDP1313G05, HDP1311G06,
and HDP1355R04) used in this study were provided by the Japan Agency
for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC). These samples were
collected from the hydrothermal vent fields at the Izena Hole (NT11-15
cruise, August 2011) and the Iheya North Knoll (NT12-06 cruise, March
2012) by the Hyper Dolphin 3K, a remotely operated vessel owned by
JAMSTEC (Figure 4 and Table S1). Photographs of the collected hydrothermal
ores are shown in Figure 5. The occurrence of sulfide deposits associated with high-temperature
fluid vents has been reported in other studies.11,37−40 The mineral assemblages of the ores (Table 2) were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD,
Rigaku Geigerflex RAD-IA, Tokyo, Japan) using Ni-filtered monochromatic
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) with 2θ angle
between 5° and 70°. Metal and metalloid compositions of
the ores (Table 3)
were determined using an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry
(ICP-MS, 8800 ICP-QQQ, Agilent Technologies, Inc., CA, USA). For these
analyses, ore samples (10–20 mg) were dissolved in HF/HCl/HNO3 (1/1/2, v/v/v) at 25 °C overnight and then dried on
a hot plate at 80–100 °C.41,42 Metals and
metalloids in a low oxidation state are readily oxidized by HNO3 and HClO. The reactants were mixed with aqua regia and dried
on a hot plate at 80–100 °C. After cooling to 25 °C,
the residue was dissolved in HNO3 and diluted with ultrapure
water before the ICP-MS analysis. Duplicate ore samples were digested
and analyzed to confirm the reproducibility, although reference material
of seafloor hydrothermal ores was not analyzed in this study.

and marcasite) and sulfate minerals (anhydrite and anglesite). Sample
HPD1355R04 was a piece of an infant chimney (“zero-age”)
and mainly consisted of Ca-sulfate minerals.42 Sample HPD1355R04 contained Zn (4300 mmol/kg), Fe (1600 mmol/kg),
Pb (510 mmol/kg), and Cu (490 mmol/kg). Pyrite was the dominant mineral
in sample HPD1311G06. Sample HPD1311G06 contained significant amounts
of Fe (5400 mmol/kg) and Zn (1200 mmol/kg), with small amounts of
Cu (84 mmol/kg), As (71 mmol/kg), and Pb (1.9 mmol/kg). Barite was
the most abundant mineral in sample HPD1313G05. Compared with the
other samples, sample HPD1313G05 contained smaller amounts of Fe (39
mmol/kg), Zn (29 mmol/kg), Cu (0.67 mmol/kg), and Pb (0.94 mmol/kg)
but high concentrations of As (179 mmol/kg) and Sb (27 mmol/kg).

On the basis of the chemical compositions and mineral assemblages
of the ores, samples HPD1313G04, HPD1313G05, HPD1311G06, and HPD1355R04
were designated as Fe–Zn–Pb-rich, Ba-rich, Fe-rich,
and Zn–Pb-rich ores, respectively, in this study.

4.2 Leaching Experiments
Each ore sample
was crushed and powdered manually before leaching experiments using
tungsten carbide and agate mortars and was sieved through 1/16 mm
mesh. Approximately 3 g of the powdered sample was stirred into 30
mL of artificial seawater (Daigo’s SP, Nihon Pharmaceutical
Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan; pH = 8.2; dissolved oxygen = 5.7 mg/L) in
an acid-cleaned polypropylene centrifuge tube (50 mL) under dark condition,
and then the tube was reciprocally shaken at 200 rpm per min at 25
°C for 5 min, 6 h, or 18 h. The shaking for 6 h is prescribed
by the Japanese Ministry for the Environment as the standard method.
The shaking for 5 min and 18 h are recommended by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Geological Survey,
respectively. The chemical components of the artificial seawater are
shown in Table S2. Samples were prepared
in triplicate for each combination. After shaking, the solid phase
was separated by centrifugation (1880g for 10 min)
and collected by filtration through a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane
filter (0.45 μm). The pH of the leachates was measured using
a pH meter (Horiba D-75, Horiba, Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) calibrated at
pH values of 4.01 and 6.86. A portion of the leachate was acidified
with HNO3 and preserved in a polypropylene tube. Metals
and metalloids present at detectable levels in the leachates (i.e.,
Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Sb, and Pb) were selected after screening
using ICP-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICAP-75, Nippon Jarrell-Ash
Co. Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) and were quantified using ICP-MS. The limit
of detection (nM) was calculated using the regression equation that
fit the standard calibration curve:43 0.28
for Mn, 1.3 for Fe, 0.12 for Cu, 2.4 for Zn, 0.58 for As, 0.027 for
Cd, 0.084 for Sb, and 0.027 for Pb.

4.3 Phytoplankton
Growth Inhibition Assay
Growth inhibition assays of the three
leachates prepared from HPD1313G05,
HPD1311G06, and HPD1355R04 were conducted using an axenic marine diatom, S. marinoi–dohrnii complex NIES-324 (formerly classified into S. costatum)12,13 obtained from the Microbial Culture Collection
at the National Institute of Environmental Studies (http://mcc.nies.go.jp). Skeletonema costatum is one of the most popular algal
test organisms for the toxicity tests of contaminants in seawater.
The test organism was maintained and precultured before growth inhibition
tests in the Daigo IMK medium (Nihon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan) prepared with 90% natural seawater and 10% distilled water,
under a white fluorescent light with a photon flux density of 70 μmol
photons m–2 s–1 and a 12 h/12
h light/dark photoperiod at 20 °C. The precultured cell suspension
in the logarithmic growth phase was diluted with a fresh culture medium
(1:19), and then 0.9 mL aliquots were transferred into Falcon 48-well
microplates (Corning, Inc., NY, USA). The initial fluorescence of
the cell suspension in each well was determined using a microplate
reader (MTP-810 Lab, Corona Electric Co. Ltd., Ibaraki, Japan) (excitation,
430 nm; emission, 680 nm) as a proxy of the chlorophyll a content and/or cell concentration on Day 0. Subsequently, each cell
suspension in duplicate wells was exposed to one of the three leachates
at multiple concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 10%. Six control wells
were also prepared (cell suspension but no leachate). The microplates
were incubated for 3 days under the culture conditions described above.
Daily changes in fluorescence intensities were determined to calculate
the growth rate (μ) of the test organism in each well, using
the following equation  where Fn and F0 are the fluorescence
intensities
on Day n and Day 0, respectively, and tn and t0 are
the number of days. We note here that the background fluorescence
emitted from the polystyrene microplate and the media solution was
removed by subtracting blank measurements (from wells containing only
medium) before calculating Fn and F0.
