Insulin and lysozyme share the common
features of being prone to
aggregate and having biomedical importance. Encapsulating lysozyme
and insulin in micellar nanoparticles probably would prevent aggregation
and facilitate oral drug delivery. Despite the vivid structural knowledge
of lysozyme and insulin, the environment-dependent oligomerization
(dimer, trimer, and multimer) and associated structural dynamics remain
elusive. The knowledge of the intra- and intermolecular interaction
profiles has cardinal importance for the design of encapsulation protocols.
We have employed various biophysical methods such as NMR spectroscopy,
X-ray crystallography, Thioflavin T fluorescence, and atomic force
microscopy in conjugation with molecular modeling to improve the understanding
of interaction dynamics during homo-oligomerization of lysozyme (human
and hen egg) and insulin (porcine, human, and glargine). The results
obtained depict the atomistic intra- and intermolecular interaction
details of the homo-oligomerization and confirm the propensity to
form fibrils. Taken together, the data accumulated and knowledge gained
will further facilitate nanoparticle design and production with insulin
or lysozyme-related protein encapsulation.

Introduction
Several
natural and synthetic proteins of pharmacological importance
(including, but not limited to, lysozyme and insulin) are prone to
aggregation into insoluble polymeric fibrils, a biologically and industrially
unwanted feature. To extend the long-term usability of pharmacologically
significant proteins, their inactivation caused by unfolding and/or
aggregation needs to be minimized. As lysozyme and insulin are well-established
protein drugs, these can serve as model components to study conditions
that could help stabilize proteins and prevent them from aggregation.
Formation of lysozyme (muramidase)1−3 or insulin complexes4−6 into higher aggregates or fibrils, but also their occurrence in
native states, needs to be studied by a combination of biochemical
and biophysical techniques to shed light into the mechanism of amyloid
formation. Protein misfolding and consequent aggregation are associated
with more than 20 diseases.7 Although a
significant amount of work has been conducted to study the amyloid-related
problems of living organisms, neither the mechanisms of fibril creation
nor some ways of their disruption are fully understood yet. What is
assumed nowadays is that inter- and intramolecular interactions could
play the decisive role for amyloidogenic processes. Both insulin and
lysozyme belong to the group of amyloidogenic proteins. There are
currently several commercial variations of insulin available: synthetic
human insulin (e.g., Actrapid, Lispro), porcine insulin (Caninsulin),
and glargine insulins (Lantus, Abasaglar, Glaritus, and Basalog) in
which one amino acid is replaced and two Arg residues are added. Beside
these variations, in the case of the glargine insulins, different
expression vectors (Escherichia coli for Lantus and Abasaglar, and yeast for Glaritus and Basalog) are
used and lead to minor conformational differences. This fact has to
be carefully considered when insulin structural data sets are compared.
Variations in the production and formulation processes can be correlated
with alterations in structure and dynamics of the proteins under study.
Glycosylation impurities have been described for the glargine insulins
(Glaritus and Basalog) that are expressed in yeasts.4−6,8 Such kind of glycosylation that
does not occur in standard insulins may influence their structural
properties, for example, the aggregation behavior of these glargine
biosimilars, but could also enhance their lifetime as it is in the
case of naturally occurring glycosylated hormones such as erythropoietin.9 However, this kind of insulin glycosylation has
to be considered as impurity since it does not occur at all in glargine
insulin (Glaritus and Basalog) molecules in a homogenous way. Glargine
insulin is a human insulin analog, with three amino acid difference.
In the A-chain of glargine insulin, Asn at position 21 is mutated
to Gly. In the B-chain of glargine insulin, two Arg residues at positions
31 and 32 are added. Recently, Hermanns et al.10 discussed the clinical impact of such modifications on
diabetes therapies. In the synthetic insulin Lispro (marketed by Eli
Lilly as Humalog), the penultimate lysine and proline residues on
the C-terminal end of the B-chain are reversed in comparison to human
insulin. This small modification in the primary sequence does not
influence the receptor binding but blocks the formation of dimers
and hexamers.11,12 This has a significant impact
on bioavailability since Lispro is active immediately. In comparison
to our biophysical studies on insulin variants (human or porcine insulin
vs the long-acting synthetic glargine insulin Lantus, Abasaglar, Glaritus,
or Basalog), the corresponding physical parameters for larger proteins
with similar clinical relevance, that is, lysozyme (here human lysozyme
(HL) and hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL)), could be obtained.

Lysozyme has been used for years as a model for amyloid aggregation.13 Recently, we have reported the ability of lysozymes
to specifically bind certain sections from the carbohydrate part of
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Klebsiella pneumoniae.(14) Nonionic detergents can also easily
interact with amino acids of the amyloidogenic region of HEWL of the
lysozyme,15 affecting thus the amyloid
fibrillization that can also be inhibited by phospholipids.16 Furthermore, the effects of detergents17 and natural products18,19 on insulin and lysozyme aggregation and lysozyme and insulin antiamyloid
structure–function screening of small libraries20 have been reported recently.

Analysis
of the corresponding intermolecular interactions is of
importance also for the design of target-directed nanoparticles because
the carbohydrate recognition part of the protein can be regarded as
an intrinsic anchor unit for cell-surface-exposed contact structures.
The surface properties (e.g., the electrostatic surface potentials)
of the two lysozymes under study (HL and HEWL) due to several variances
in the amino acid sequences differ from each other. These differences
can be correlated with the aggregation/fibrillization behavior of
the two lysozyme species—HL and HEWL. It has to be emphasized
that for both classes of biomolecules (insulins and lysozymes), new
data with respect to the aggregation dynamics can be achieved when
the arsenal of biophysical techniques is applied in a way that all
processes on the submolecular and in the case of ion involvement are
considered. Similar to the aggregation behavior of glargine insulins
also in the case of the lysozymes under study Arg residues and the
corresponding charges play a crucial role in both dimer and multimer
formations. Knowledge about all crucial details in relation to the
structural stability under different physical and chemical conditions
is essential for the optimal clinical application of encapsulated
protein drugs. In the case of the encapsulation of small organic compounds
that are used, for example, as antipsychotic drugs, it is of relevance
to analyze their structural behavior at a high precision level using
ab initio calculations.21−23 The requirements to utilize quantum
chemical approaches relate to hindered rotations in partial double
bonds that are often occurring in medications that are used as therapeutics
against schizophrenia and other psychotic diseases.24 Also in the case of larger drugs, one has to proceed in
a similar way when these compounds have to be encapsulated in target-directed
nanoparticles.25−27 Accordingly, we centered our attention on studies
of the structure, aggregation, and intermolecular interaction profiles
of these proteins and on possibilities to encapsulate them into lipid
nanoparticle carriers. In the case of an effective oral peptide/protein
drug delivery, it is essential that so-called absorption enhancers
enable an efficient transfer from the gastrointestinal tract to the
bloodstream. Therefore, the drug-containing nanoparticles and the
target cell in the intestine have to interact in a specific way. As
the target molecules of these nanoparticles, cell-surface-exposed
carbohydrate structures such as sialic acids14,27−31 will be our main focus. We selected insulin and lysozyme as two
well-characterized proteins in combination with a set of biophysical
techniques to perform an exemplary study for protein stability and
optional forms of drug delivery.

Results and Discussion
X-ray
Crystallography Assay and Molecular Modeling Analysis
By
variation of crystallization conditions for the structure determination
of HL in complex with a tetrasaccharide,14 we have obtained crystals of HL with one lysozyme molecule per asymmetric
unit (monomeric form) and crystals with two lysozyme molecules per
asymmetric unit (dimeric form), as shown in Table 1 (Hlys #1 and Hlys #2, respectively). The
arrangement of the two lysozyme molecules within this dimeric form
differs significantly from the dimeric arrangement as predicted based
on monomeric lysozyme by molecular modeling approaches as described
before (Figure 1a–c).
In addition, we have not found further evidence for these in silico
results when human lysozyme has been analyzed with NMR methods at
different pH values since monomers seem to be the preferred state.

Ten
different insulin clusters resulted from Haddock 2.2 dimer
simulation. Energy optimization was carried out on all of these dimers
using the Hyperchem 8.0 program to assess the energetically most favorable
structure. Table 2 summarizes
the results from this minimization.

Protein dimer 1 corresponds
to the crystal structure 1lzs.pdb. The other dimeric
structures exhibit only a few kcal/mol higher energy. Molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations were performed to evaluate the possible existence
of the dimeric forms under physiological conditions. Protein dimer
1 as well as the protein dimer from the crystal structure 1lzs.pdb were stable
at pH = 7.4 at 298 K in physiological saline solution for 10 ns and
showed only little fluctuations during the simulation. Accordingly,
we can assume that the human lysozyme may exist in dimeric form under
physiological conditions.

In the case of the insulins under
study (human insulin, Actrapid/Lispro;
porcine insulin, Caninsulin; and the synthetic long-acting glargine
insulins), higher aggregates were not detected by NMR under the chosen
measurement conditions. However, structural data sets based on X-ray
or neutron diffraction experiments are available in the protein data
bank: 3w7y.pdb, 1mso.pdb, and 3fhp.pdb.

Thioflavin
T (ThT) Fluorescence Assay and Atomic Force Microscopy
(AFM) Analysis
Comparing fibril formations of HL and HEWL
using ThT assay, significant differences were observed in kinetics
of fibrillization and amount of amyloid fibril aggregates (Figure 2). The time dependences
of amyloid fibril formation determined for hen (red circles, HEWL)
and human (blue triangles, HL) lysozymes (10 μM) differ in the
lag phase, slope of the elongation phase, and value of plateau phase
corresponding to the fibril mass. The formation of non-native states
of lysozyme required for amyloid fibrillization that is occurring
during lag phase was significantly prolonged in the case of human
lysozyme with lag phase about 28 min. Hen egg white lysozyme form
these species under 10 min. The overall time for formation of mature
fibrils was also different—about 50 min for HL and 20 min for
HEWL to achieve plateau for the fluorescence intensities. The observed
kinetic characteristics of HL and HEWL fibrillization are summarized
in Table 3. The lower
fluorescence intensities of the plateau phase (10 000 au) for
HL compare to HEWL (70 000 au), suggesting formation of a lower
amount of fibrillar structure or their association to bigger clusters.

Figure 2 Time dependences
of amyloid fibril formation determined for hen
egg white (red circles) and human (blue triangles) lysozyme (10 μM).
The aliquots were selected at given time intervals, and the extent
of lysozyme fibrillization was monitored by Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence
assay (20 μM, ThT). The error bars represent the average deviation
for repeated measurements of three separate samples. The curves were
obtained by fitting of the average values by a nonlinear least-square
method using Sigmoidal curve-parameter 4 in SigmaPlot software. The
times of about 50 min (HL) and 20 min (HEWL) correspond to the plateau
for the fluorescence intensities.

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is an important technique for visualization
of amyloid aggregates. The obtained AFM images of lysozyme aggregates
(Figure 3 a,b) confirmed
the ThT results.

Figure 3 AFM images of (a) human lysozyme (HL) and (b) hen egg
white lysozyme
(HEWL) amyloid fibrils confirm the (ThT) fluorescence assay results
by another biophysical technique in an independent way.

These two complementary methods were also used
for a detailed analysis
of insulin fibril formation. Differences between fibril formation
of human insulin and glargine insulin using ThT assay are still detectable
(Figure 4) but not
so obvious as in the case of lysozymes (Figure 2). Fibril formation of both types of insulin
follows the nucleation polymerization model. The modified amino acid
chain of the glargine insulin does not lead to stronger alterations
when comparing glargine with human insulin during the fibril-formation
process; however, insulin Basalog (blue triangles) has a longer lag
phase (4.5 min) when compared to human insulin tlag equal to 1.5 min (green triangles). The differences in
other kinetic parameters (t1/2, tplateau, and Ifluomax) are not so significant and are presented in Table 3.

fibril formation determined for glargine
insulin Basalog (blue triangles) and human insulin (green triangles)
(10 μM). Left side, complete time period. Inset, time period
of fibril formation between 1 and 15 min. The data were fitted with
sigmoidal curve-parameter 4 with the equation: y0 + a/(1 + exp(−(x – x0)/b)).

After 2 h, the morphologies of
human insulin and glargine insulin
fibrils visualized using the AFM technique show small but characteristic
differences (Figure 5a,b). Glargine insulin (Figure 5b) forms unbranched fibrils that are thinner than fibrils
of human insulin (Figure 5a).

Figure 5 AFM images of 10 μM glargine insulin Basalog (a) and human
insulin (b) after 2 h incubation at 65 °C with constant stirring
(1200 rpm).

Next, we tested with
NMR methods whether critical parameters of
the insulins and lysozyme for further structural comparison can be
obtained under physiological conditions.

NMR Results—Analyses
of Human, Porcine, and Glargine
Insulins as well as Human Lysozyme from Transgenic Cow
We
have found that it is possible to record NMR spectra of insulin drugs
taken directly from the injection pen (Figure 6a,b). Large excipient signals were detected,
but they do not disturb our structural analysis of the compounds itself
in a significant way. The two one-dimensional (1D) NMR spectra Figure 6a (top, bottom) show
Abasaglar glargine probes from two different charges, which were stored
in a slightly different way. One probe was stored permanently in the
refrigerator; the other one was stored for one night outside the refrigerator
at room temperature. The 1D spectra of the two probes are completely
identical and can therefore not be discriminated although the injection
pens have been treated under different cooling conditions. Also in
the corresponding nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOESY) spectra (Figure 6b), no differences
were detected. It turned out that especially the NOESY spectra of
Abasaglar glargine insulin can be evaluated despite the strong excipient
signals in a sufficient way.

Figure 6 (a) Abasaglar glargine insulin spectra taken
from different charges
of insulin pens, which were stored under slightly different cooling
conditions. The 1D NMR spectra of the two charges in top and bottom
show identical signals. (b) NOESY NMR spectrum of the Abasaglar glargine
insulin sample. Although the excipients produce strong disturbing
signals, it is possible to structurally analyze the protein drug in
its solution taken directly from the injection pen.

Contrary to the Abasaglar insulin probes that were
taken directly
from the injection pen, all signals of the human lysozyme extracted
from the milk of transgenic cow belong to the protein (Figure 7a). The NOESY (Figure 7b) and total correlation spectroscopy
(TOCSY) (Figure 7c)
were used to confirm that the human lysozyme analyzed from another
source in a former study14 and the human
lysozyme extracted from the milk of transgenic cow do not differ from
each other. With these data, it is now possible to discuss the intermolecular
interaction dynamics for various insulins and lysozymes in detail.

Figure 7 a) One-dimensional
proton NMR spectrum of human lysozyme extracted
from the milk of clone cows. The corresponding NOESY (b) and TOCSY
(c) spectra are also shown. The evaluation of these spectra have led
to the conclusion that no significant differences exist between the
structures of the human lysozyme analyzed in a former study14 and human lysozyme extracted from the milk of
clone cows.

An overlay of the 1D
NMR spectrum glargine insulin Lantus (blue)
with that of Glaritus (red) confirms the detected differences over
the whole spectral range (Figure S1). An
overlay of the two-dimensional (2D) NMR spectra of the glargine insulin
Lantus (blue) with the glargine insulin Glaritus (red) shows differences,
which concern the Asn18 residue in a certain spectral region (Figure S2). Furthermore, an extra peak has been
detected in the case of the glargine insulin Glaritus (red) (Figure S2). It has to be emphasized here that
the corresponding ligand–receptor complex does not show any
involvement of Asn18 in receptor binding (Figure S3). Therefore, any potential modification at this position
(e.g., glycosylation) will not have a significant impact on receptor
binding.

The 1D NMR spectrum of the porcine insulin Caninsulin
(MSD), which
is presented in Figure S4, is a medication
used for diabetes treatment in dogs. The amino acid sequence of Caninsulin
is identical to pig (porcine) insulin. The Thr residue at position
30 in the B-chain is replaced by Ala in porcine insulin in comparison
to human insulin. The sharp signals point to monomeric states of this
insulin in the NMR tube.

Molecular Modeling Supported NMR Analyses
of HL and HEWL Lysozymes
in Comparison to Insulins
Owing to the complexity and robustness
of nanoparticle delivery systems of protein drugs, it is essential
to consider the complementarity of experimental and modeling data
in the development of optimal encapsulation strategies. We combined
at first the experimental and molecular modeling data that were obtained
for lysozyme (HL and HEWL) (Figure 8a–f) and then compared them with the corresponding
experimental and theoretical data gained for insulins (Figure 9a–e). The relation between
pH values and lysozyme (HL and HEWL) structures is indicated by the
overlay presentations shown in Figure 8c,d. When human lysozyme is encapsulated in nanoparticles
for a therapeutic use, precise knowledge of the submolecular details
about its carbohydrate affinity14 is of
importance because this part of the molecule can be considered as
a vital target unit. Three essential amino acids—Tyr63 (yellow),
Arg98 (red), and Trp109 (blue)—are stabilizing the complex
(5lsh.pdb),
highlighted in Figure 8e. The surface presentation of the same complex shown in Figure 8f visualizes the
shape of the carbohydrate recognition part of human lysozyme. The
human lysozyme (Figure 8a–f) and insulin (Figure 9a–e) data are valuable references when MD simulations
in micelles are considered and were performed for nanoparticles as
indicated in Figure 10. The surface presentations of the glargine insulin Lantus (Figure 9a, monomer) and the
porcine insulin Caninsulin (Figure 9b, monomer) including their electrostatic surface potentials
can be compared with each other and taken as starting structures in
our MD simulations. It is necessary to correlate the data sets describing
dimeric forms of human insulin (3w7y.pdb, 1mso.pdb) and porcine insulin (3fhp.pdb) as presented
in Figure 9c–e
illustrating structural data of lysozymes.

Figure 10 Structure–volume correlations of glargine insulin in “coarse-grained”
(CG) presentation encapsulated into nine differently sized nanoparticles.
The central pie chart illustrates the increase of the particle volumes.
The insulin color coding (chain A red, chain B green) and the CG to
all-atoms reverse engineering are shown in the right part of the figure
(in CPK, ribbon and surface presentation). Particle sizes (radius):
(1) 18 nm; (2) 23 nm; (3) 28 nm; (4) 33 nm; (5) 38 nm; (6) 43 nm;
(7) 48 nm; (8) 53 nm; and (9) 58 nm.

Encapsulation of insulin into adequately sized liposome nanoparticles
could facilitate optimal oral delivery of insulin while eliminating
possible fibrillation processes in tissue around the injection areas.
In silico methodologies were utilized to assess the nanoparticle size–insulin
saturation relationships. Several differently sized liposome nanoparticles
with diameters from around 35 nm up to approaching 120 nm were constructed
using the PACKMOL37 program. The number
of non-hydrogen atoms of insulin needed for molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations can be decreased by three quarters when employing the
coarse-grained (CG) approach/representation of atoms. Several observations
employing different-level CG modeling (both Monte Carlo and MD simulations)
for insulins and lysozymes38−47 were published recently. The total number of CG atoms in our case
of glargine insulin is reduced to 95. Consequently, hundreds of insulin
molecules can be easily modeled and encapsulated into differently
sized liposomal nanoparticles. Figure 10 represents nine such models sized from
35 to 120 nm.

The structure of the 65 nm liposomal nanoparticle
with embedded
glargine insulins, as shown in Figure 11, was generated using the PACKMOL37 program. All-atom approach for insulins was
used in original building step, as seen in Figure 11c,d. In the geometry-optimized spherical
model, as seen from the highlighted insulin–insulin intermolecular
distance, the molecules are far away from each other to allow aggregation.
The lipid molecules (CG models of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC)
and dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC) used in this particular model; Figure 11e and 11f), restrict the motion of the insulins reducing
thus their possibility to aggregate. As expected, specific intermolecular
interaction processes are also dependent on certain ions in the protein
environment. Figure 11a shows the ribbon presentation of porcine insulin in the presence
of a trimethylamine N-oxide molecule (similar to
the Abasaglar formulation of glargine insulin) based on the X-ray
structure 3t2a.pdb. Figure 11b
displays the same presentation of an X-ray structure of porcine insulin
without the trimethylamine N-oxide (4a7e.pdb).

are protected from solvent and other environmental effects.

The combined molecular analysis
methodologies, presented and applied
here as the inaugural part for drug encapsulation strategy, have wide
application options in addition to our tests on lysozyme and insulin.
The strategy could also be applied for example to antimicrobial defensins
and neuraminidases in cancer therapy. In any case, it is essential
that the nanoparticles have a target function with respect to contact
structures on the corresponding cell surfaces. The MARCKS-ED peptide
with its polysialic acid affinity28 is
a good candidate to become a suitable targeting peptide on the nanoparticle
surface. The data presented in this publication have to be considered
as essential information for better understanding of the submolecular
interactions in relation to the aggregation dynamics of protein drugs.
Encapsulation into liposome nanoparticles could improve the delivery
strategies for these therapeutics. The molecular surface properties
of the protein drugs were studied with a combination of biophysical
and biochemical methods including sophisticated analytical techniques
and newly developed concepts.49−54 Large-scale production of insulin53 and
the status quo of opportunities of insulin treatment53 as described in the corresponding articles might initialize
the distinct need for better understanding of the aggregation behavior
of insulins (human, porcine, and synthetic glargine variants). This
is valid also in a similar way for lysozymes (HL and HEWL), especially
specific intermolecular interactions in order to proceed toward potential
applications in the framework of innovative nanomedical therapies.
In the case of lysozymes, the results on specific interactions with
the carbohydrate part of the LPS chains on pathogen surfaces have
just been published.14 The findings with
respect to an intrinsic molecular target function can be combined
with the concept of targeting peptides on the surfaces of nanoparticles.
When protein drugs are delivered by nanoparticles with target-directed
absorption enhancers (e.g., certain collagen fragments) on their surfaces,
the molecular fine-tuning of all components of the delivery system
is the crucial step for a therapeutic success. Therefore, it is of
highest importance to carefully evaluate the data concerning the structure–function
relationship of the aggregation dynamics of lysozymes and insulins
as described here. Certain parameters such as pH values, temperature,
and electrostatic potentials have to be correlated with excipient
and specific receptor interactions as obtained by a combination of
biophysical techniques and molecular modeling methods. Consequently,
the structural and physiological properties (adjusted or personalized)
of insulin or lysozyme embedded into a delivery nanoparticle could
be directly correlated with the functional effects in the patient’s
organism after their release.

Conclusions
Liposomal
encapsulation for drug delivery is a significant technique
as it provides an alternative to injections, and currently many research
groups around the world are carrying out research55−57 to develop
needle-free drug delivery techniques, which will improve patient compliance.
The current study is focused on understanding the homo-oligomerization
of the important amyloidogenic proteins lysozyme and insulin. Both
are well-established amyloidogenic proteins, and both are therapeutic
agents. Clinical cases show that insulin can form amyloid particles
at the site of injection known as insulin balls.58−61 To prevent such undesired amyloidosis,
it is necessary to develop advanced drug delivery systems,62 in conjunction with insulin manufacture and
treatment.63−65 Liposomal encapsulation of insulin can be a convenient
alternative drug delivery strategy. The association state of the proteins
is an important determinant factor of protein encapsulation into lipid-based
colloidal carriers66 along with lipid–protein
interaction.67 Furthermore, one needs to
consider the interaction of the protein with the chosen lipid model
as it is another important determinant factor, which can be studied
in silico prior to wet lab experiments.

Our results show that
under the different molecular environmental
conditions, the association state of lysozyme and insulin varies.
The variability in the molecular association governs the amyloid kinetics
and the final aggregation state, as conferred from the amyloid kinetic
studies of lysozyme and insulin variants. These results can help device
encapsulation strategies for different lysozymes and insulins. Several
other peptide-based therapeutics can be further studied as discussed
in an earlier section for designing the liposomal protein encapsulation.

Experimental
Section
NMR Sample Preparation
All samples were prepared by
dissolving lyophilized human lysozyme (HL) or hen egg white lysozyme
(HEWL) in 0.3 mL of H2O containing 20 mM sodium phosphate
buffer and 10% D2O. Final concentrations of all samples
were 0.5 mM protein as determined by measurement of the molar extinction
coefficient, using E1% (w/v) = 25.5 for HL and 26.4 for HEWL. The
following samples were prepared: pure HL and HEWL at pH 3.8 and 5.5,
respectively. Additional samples for HL were prepared in a similar
manner for the pH titrations described below.

NMR spectroscopy
including pH adjustments and pKa measurements
of HL: All NMR spectra were obtained using a Varian Unity INOVA 800
MHz spectrometer at 35 °C. The 1H chemical shifts were referenced
to 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid. All experiments were
run with 3 mm Shigemi tubes. Homonuclear two-dimensional (2D) NOESY
and TOCSY (64 transients for each) with spectral width 11204 Hz for
both dimensions were acquired with 512 increments in the indirect
dimension and 4096 data points in the direct dimension using Watergate
solvent suppression and a pulse sequence repetition delay of 1.5 s.
The NMRPipe68 software package was used
to process all NMR data by zero-filling to 1024 points in the indirect
dimension and ending with either a Gaussian or a shifted sine-bell
function. The digital resolution was 0.0015 and 0.014 ppm for the
direct and indirect dimensions, respectively, after zero-filling.
The following mixing times were used: 150 ms for the NOESYs and 50
ms for the TOCSYs. Ten NOESY spectra were recorded at different pH
values between the range 3.8 and 8.1 (3.8, 4.2, 4.6, 5.0, 5.5, 6.2,
6.8, 7.4, 7.7, and 8.1) for pKa determination
of HL. A separate set of HL samples was used to record 1D spectra
at 22 different pH conditions in between 3.17 and 8.13 in step increment
of ∼0.2 units. All 1D data sets were defined by 4096 complex
points and consisted of 256 transients. The digital resolution of
the 1D spectra was 0.0024 ppm after zero-filling. XEASY,69 MNova,70 and CCPNmr71 were used for analysis and resonance assignment.
Line widths are defined as half-width at half-height of a peak; for
most peaks, the line width was estimated to be 0.01 ppm. NMR-derived
models are displayed with the MOLMOL program.72

For adjusting pH values, either H3PO4 or
NaOH was used by addition of small aliquots. The standard solutions
(from Sigma) at pH 4 and 7 were used to calibrate the pH meter. The
temperature dependence of the pH reading for HL was checked by recalibrating
the pH meter at 35 °C: the difference between an incubated lysozyme
sample at 35 °C and at room temperature was less than 0.1 pH
unit. Before and after each experiment, the pH for each sample was
measured to warrant constant conditions.

The list of excipients
in Abasaglar insulin is as follows: zinc
oxide, metacresol, glycerol, hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment),
sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment), and water for injections. Therefore,
strong signals from metacresol and glycerol occur in the spectra beside
the protein signals.

In the case of human lysozyme, which was
isolated from the milk
of cloned transgenic cows, only the pure protein was extracted and
therefore no disturbing signals were occurring in the corresponding
spectra.53

Molecular Modeling
The structure of human lysozyme
was investigated for its dimerization potential with the web server
Haddock 2.2.73 For this purpose, the respective
monomer proteins from 1lzs.pdb32 were used. The different
protein–protein docking results were subjected to an energy
minimization with the program Hyperchem 8.074 using the CHARMM27 force field75 in an
aqueous environment. To test the stability of the dimeric proteins,
an MD simulation over 10 ns at 298 K was carried out with the dimer
from 1lzs.pdb,
as well as with the most energetically favorable dimer from the Haddock
2.2 experiment at pH = 7.4 in physiological saline. For this, the
program YASARA v.12.11.2576 with the NOVA
force field was used. The PyMOL33 software
package was applied for visualization of the monomers and dimers.

The PACKMOL37 program was used to build
the liposome structures containing the embedded insulin molecules.
The combination of NAMD/VMD77,78 programs was used for
further structural modeling and visualization. Coarse-grained models
of modeling dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC) and modeling dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine
(DPPC) were used in liposome generation, whereas both all-atom and
CG models of insulin were applied for the protein embedment. The PACKMOL37-created structures were then transformed into
formats suitable for MD programs for CG simulations (GROMACS79−84 and LAMMPS85) with the help of TopoTools
(https://sites.google.com/site/akohlmey/software/topotools),
VMD plugin, and Moltemplate (https://www.moltemplate.org/). The Martini force field86−88 was used for CG simulations. Finally, the OVITO89 program was used for structure control and trajectory analysis.

X-ray Crystallography
The crystallization and structure
determination of human lysozyme were performed as described previously.14 In brief, human lysozyme crystals were obtained
at 18 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals
were grown in 0.8 M NaCl, 25 mM NaOAc buffer (pH 4.4), 0.8 M NaCl,
and 50 mM NaCitrate buffer (pH 5.8). All data collections were performed
at 100 K and were processed with the XDS/XSCALE90 program package. The human lysozyme structure (PDB id: 1rex)91 was used as the search model for molecular replacement
with the MOLREP program.92 The Refmac5
program as implemented in the CCP4 suite93,94 and PHENIX95 was used for model building
and refinement.

Amyloid Fibrillization of Hen and Human Lysozymes,
Glargine,
and Human Insulin
Hen egg white (HEWL) and human (HL) lysozyme
amyloid fibrils were prepared through the incubation of 10 μM
lysozyme at 65 °C with constant stirring (1200 rpm) in 70 mM
glycine buffer containing 80 mM NaCl, pH 2.7. Human and glargine insulin
solutions at 10 μM final concentration prepared in 100 mM NaCl–HCl
buffer, pH1.6, were incubated at 65 °C, 1200 rpm for 2 h. To
study kinetics of fibrillization processes, aliquots of lysozymes/insulins
were withdrawn at varying times. Formation of amyloid aggregates was
observed using the ThT assay. All experiments were performed in triplicate,
and the presented data represent average values with standard deviations.
The data were fitted with sigmoidal curve-parameter 4 with the equation: y0 + a/(1 + exp(−(x – x0)/b)) using SigmaPlot software. The presence of lysozyme/insulin amyloid
fibrils was confirmed by atomic force microscopy.

Thioflavin
T Fluorescence Assay
The amyloid aggregation
of lysozymes and insulins was assayed by a significant enhancement
of Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence in the presence of amyloid fibrils.
Thioflavin T was added to lysozyme/insulin samples (10 μM) to
a final concentration of 20 μM. Measurements were performed
in a 96-well plate using a Synergy MX (BioTek) spectrofluorimeter.
The excitation wavelength was set at 440 nm and the emission recorded
at 485 nm. The excitation and emission slits were adjusted to 9.0/9.0
nm, and the top probe vertical offset was 6 mm.96−100

Atomic Force Microscopy
Samples
were deposited by drop
casting on the freshly cleaved mica surface. After 5 min adsorption,
the samples were washed with ultrapure water and left to dry. The
protein concentration of 10 μM was used. AFM images were taken
by a Scanning Probe Microscope (Veeco di Innova, Bruker AXS Inc.,
Madison) in a tapping mode using uncoated silicon cantilevers TESPA,
unmounted with force constant 42 N/m and nominal resonance frequency
ν = 320 kHz, with Al reflective coating (Bruker AFM Probes,
Camarillo). The resolution of the image was 512 pixels per line (512
× 512 pixels/image) with a scan rate of 0.5 kHz. All the images
are unfiltered.96−100
