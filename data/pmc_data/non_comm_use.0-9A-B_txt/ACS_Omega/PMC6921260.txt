Syngas production from dry reforming of biogas (DRB)
is studied
experimentally in this work. Ni/Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, and Pt-Ni/Al2O3 are used
as catalysts to examine the effect of CO2 content in biogas
and H2O addition on DRB performance for reaction temperatures
in the 600–800 °C range. It is found that the bimetallic
Pt–Ni catalyst exhibits the best activity and thermal stability
among the three types of catalysts studied due to better carbon deposition
resistance. Because CO2 functions as the oxidant in combustion,
CH4 conversion is enhanced when the biogas contains more
CO2. One hundred percent CO2 conversion can
be reached for biogas containing a less amount of CO2 at
high temperatures. With H2O addition in DRB, the steam
reforming of methane (SRM) reaction is the dominant reaction, resulting
in higher H2 and CO yields with biogas containing lesser
amounts of CO2. However, lower CH4 conversion
and negative CO2 conversion do result. With higher CO2 content in the biogas, higher CH4 and CO2 conversions can be obtained. Lower yields of H2 and CO
are obtained due to less SRM dominance. With H2O addition
in biogas, the H2/CO ratio with a value greater than 1
can be obtained from DRB. It is also found that the H2/CO
ratio with a value of 2.1 can be obtained for reactant composition
with a molar ratio of CH4/CO2/H2O
= 1:0.25:1 and reaction temperature of 800 °C.

1 Introduction
Due to continuous increase
in energy demand and impact of fossil
fuel on the environment, search for new energy resources becomes an
important issue. Biogas has been recognized to be a versatile renewable
energy source and is receiving increased interest because it can be
used to replace fossil fuels. It is formed by the anaerobic digestion
or bacterial fermentation of biomass. Biogas is composed mainly of
methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) with minor
species such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and ammonia (NH3).1,2 Biogas can be utilized in various applications
such as heat, mechanical power, and electricity generation.

Biogas can also serve as feedstock for the catalytic dry reforming
process for syngas production because the main species are CH4 and CO2. Similar to conventional methane dry reforming,
the chemical reactions involved in the dry reforming biogas (DRB)
reactions are dry reforming of methane (DRM) and reverse water-gas
shift (RWGS) reactions:3,4 1   2  Syngas, consisting mainly
of H2 and CO, is an important raw material in Fischer–Tropsch
synthesis for high-chained hydrocarbon fuels or to produce oxygenated
compounds.5,6 However, there are two serious problems
involved in DRB. It is a highly endothermic reaction according to eq 1, which consumes much energy
and deactivates catalysts due to catalyst carbon deposition. DRB is
usually operated at high temperatures because of high energy requirement.
This results in catalyst support collapse or metal sintering. In DRB,
carbon is formed mainly by methane decomposition (MD) and the Boudouard
reaction (BR) 3   4  The endothermic MD reaction
is favored at higher temperatures and lower pressures. The exothermic
Boudouard reaction is favored at lower temperatures and higher pressures.7,8 For enhancing catalyst stability and carbon deposition resistance
ability, the process parameters such as reaction temperature, reactant
flow rate, and catalyst support and active phase can be adjusted.9,10

In the past, great efforts have been devoted to develop a
variety
of noble and transition-metal-supported catalysts for DRM or DRB.11 Among all the metals, Ni-based catalysts are
more attractive for DRM or DRB due to their high activity and low
cost.12,13 However, sintering of Ni nanoparticles and
deposition of carbon on Ni-based catalyst surfaces cause rapid catalyst
deactivation.14,15 There are large amounts of efforts
have also been made to improve the capability of Ni-based catalysts.16 In the study by Li et al.,17,18 they pointed out that catalyst design with a core/yolk–shell
structure is one of the most effective ways for resisting the sintering
and carbon of catalysts in the application of syngas production from
hydrocarbon reforming reactions. In the studies by Das et al.19 and Tang et al.,20 various catalyst supports were developed for improving the catalyst
capability. In addition to catalyst developments, reactor design also
plays an important role in enhancing the DRM performance. As compared
with the traditional fixed-bed reactor, DRM performance can be enhanced
using a membrane reactor21 and fluidized
bed reactors.22 As noted above, biogas
contains various impurities. Effects of these impurities on catalyst
capability for DRM were also reported in the literature.23−25

According to the studies by Bian et al.26 and De et al.,27 bimetallic
catalysts
may exhibit superior activity, selectivity, and deactivation resistance
compared to the corresponding monometallic catalysts. Ni-based catalyst
modification using a very small amount of noble metal can result in
an inexpensive bimetallic catalyst that assures both high activity
and carbon deposition resistance.28−31 In the study by García-Diéguez
et al.28 Pt–Ni/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared and used for the DRM reaction. They
reported that Pt addition inhibited global carbon formation and avoided
Ni sintering at 700 °C reaction temperature. Gould et al.29 found that Pt-Ni/Al2O3 activity prepared using atomic layer deposition can be doubled compared
with that prepared using conventional incipient wetness impregnation.
Li et al.30 reported that surface modification
by adding Pt atoms can effectively enhance catalytic activity and
carbon deposition resistance for impregnating Pt onto reduced Ni/Al2O3. In the study by Özkara-Aydınoğlu
and Aksoylu,31 kinetics and the surface
reaction mechanism of DRM were studied over Pt-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts with various Ni/Pt loading ratios. They pointed
out that the CO inhibition effect is stronger and CO2 utilization
is suppressed on the catalyst with high Ni/Pt loading ratios.

In addition to catalyst development, carbon deposition can be significantly
inhibited by adding steam in the dry reforming process.32,33 With steam addition, the DRB or DRM is coupled with steam reforming
of methane (SRM) described as 5  The combined DRM and SRM are
also known as the bireforming of methane (BRM) described as 6  As pointed
out in the study by Kumar et al.,34 BRM
has benefits such as H2/CO ratio flexibility for the produced
syngas, carbon formation reduction, high methane conversion, and high
selectivity to H2 and CO. In the study by Olah et al.,35 BRM was carried out for syngas with an H2/CO ratio of 2 for methanol synthesis using metal oxide-supported
catalysts at elevated pressures. Choudhary and Rajput36 reported on the complete methane conversion toward syngas
using combined dry steam reforming of methane at 850 °C. Koo
et al.37 investigated the combination of
DRM and SRM and found that an H2/CO ratio of 2 could be
achieved using a feed ratio of CH4/CO2/H2O = 1:0.4:0.8. In the study by Karemore et al.,38 the influence of reaction variables over dry
and mixed reforming of methane for syngas production using the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst in a fixed bed reactor was studied.
Their results showed that reactant conversion and product yield increased
with the increase in space time. In the study by Ashok et al.,39 the Ni–SiO2–MgO catalyst
was prepared for the BRM reaction. At 750 °C, the CH4 conversion of 80%, CO2 conversion of 60%, and H2/CO ratio of 2 can be reached with negligible carbon deposition.

Although bimetallic Ni-based catalysts for DRM have been studied
extensively in the past, its ability in DRB having a lesser amount
of CO2 is unclear. Similarly, combined DRM and SRM were
also studied extensively in the literature. The CO2 amount
effect in the feedstock on syngas production performance is also not
clear. Biogas was used as the feedstock for syngas production via
the dry reforming process in this study. The CO2 amount
contained in the biogas, catalyst type, and H2O addition
effects on the syngas production performance are addressed.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Catalyst Characterization
Three kinds
of catalysts were prepared and tested in this study. As indicated
in Table S1, the weight percentage is based
on the weight of the support. From Table S1, it can be seen that the chemical composition determined by XRF
is close to the designed values. Table 1 shows the textural properties of the catalyst and
support based on the N2 physisorption test. Using Al2O3 support surface area as a reference, the specific
catalyst surface area decreases due to the metal impregnation onto
the Al2O3 pore surface. Table 1 shows the average pore diameters ranged
from 20 to 40 Å. This indicates that the catalysts are mesoporous
solids.40

Table 1 Textural Properties of Catalyst and
Support
sample	SBET (m2/g)	pore volume (cm3/g) (BJH)	mean pore
diameter (Å) (BJH)	
γ-Al2O3	234.9	0.519	25.264	
10wt%Ni/Al2O3	147.8	0.383	31.336	
3wt%Pt/Al2O3	178.7	0.395	29.055	
3wt%Pt-10wt%Ni/Al2O3	163.0	0.429	31.419	
The XRD patterns for the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst
before and after reduction are shown in Figure 1a. No characteristic crystalline peaks corresponding
to metallic Ni or NiO species were found for the case before reduction.
This indicates that the Ni is highly dispersed and has a small particle
size. However, nickel aluminate spinels (NiAl2O4) were present and cannot be ignored. The spinel crystalline peaks
overlap with those of γ-Al2O3 at 37.5°,
45.8°, and 66.8°. As reported by Penkova et al.,41 the Ni loading is critical to spinel formation.
In this study, the Ni loading is 10 wt %. According to the study by
Penkova et al.,41 Ni loading should be
higher than 33% for transforming all of γ-Al2O3 into NiAl2O4. Therefore, NiAl2O4 spinels should coexist with γ-Al2O3 support (JCPDS 00-004-0880).41 Ni crystalline corresponding to the diffraction peaks appeared at
44.5°, 51.7°, and 76.4° (JCPDS 87-0712) was found and
is shown in Figure 2a after reduction in a H2 atmosphere. This indicates that
metallic Ni is the predominant active phase for the reaction. The
XRD patterns for the Pt–Ni/Al2O3 catalyst
are shown in Figure 1b. The XRD pattern of Ni–Pt/Al2O3 before
the reduction case is similar to that of Ni/Al2O3 except that a peak appeared at 39° for PtO (JCPDS 43-1100).
Peaks for Pt appeared at 39.8°, 46.3°, and 67.6° (JCPDS
65-2868) can be found after reduction. As pointed out in the study
by García-Diéguez et al.,28 Pt–Ni alloy can be detected from the XRD pattern of Pt–Ni
catalysts. The peaks of Pt–Ni alloy appear at 41.5° and
48.4°. The appearance of Pt–Ni alloy depends on the load
ratio of Pt/Ni. The Pt–Ni alloy can only be detected as the
Pt/Ni ratio is high enough. Due to the low Pt/Ni ratio, the Pt–Ni
alloy peaks are not detected in the XRD pattern shown in Figure 1b. From the XRD pattern
for the Ni–Pt/CeO2/Al2O3 catalyst
reported in the study by le Saché et al.,42 peaks of Pt and Ni can still be found in the XRD pattern
of the Pt–Ni catalyst before and after the reaction. According
to the study by Larimi and Khorash,43 the
XRD pattern of the Pt–Ni catalyst showed no evidence of Ni
or Pt peaks. They argued that this is because of the formation of
Ni–Pt alloy. An increase in the Pt content resulted in a decrease
in the diffraction angle related to the Ni–Pt alloy. Based
on these studies, the XRD pattern shown in Figure 1b agrees with those obtained by García-Diéguez
et al.28 and by le Saché et al.42

Ni/Al2O3 and (b) Pt–Ni/Al2O3.

Figure 2 TPR profiles of the Ni/Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, and Pt–Ni/Al2O3 catalysts
calcined at 800 °C.

Figure 2 shows the
H2-TPR profiles for Ni/Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, and Pt–Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. By measuring the H2 consumption, it is seen
that the peak temperature is observed in the 780–800 °C
range for the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. The high reduction
temperature indicates strong interaction between NiO and Al2O3 support. It can also be attributed to the reduction
of surface spinel species NiAl2O4 formed by
the diffusion of NiO into Al2O3. Similar type
TPR behavior was also observed by Chen et al.44 and le Saché et al.42 For the
Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, a broad peak can be observed,
which extends over the 250–400 °C range. The shape of
the peak indicates that various reducible platinum species are present.
For Pt-Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, two peaks appeared
in the TPR curve. By comparing Pt/Al2O3 with
Ni/Al2O3, these two peaks correspond to the
reductions of Pt and Ni, respectively. Based on the results shown
in Figure 3, the in
situ reduction temperature of the catalyst is chosen as 900 °C.

CO2 conversion, (c) H2 yield, (d) CO yield,
and (e) H2/CO ratio.

2.2 Effect of Catalyst Types on DRB
We
first examined the catalyst type effect on DRB performance. Figure 3 is the time-on-stream
measured DRB performance for CH4/CO2/H2O = 1:1:0 (case 1 in Table S2) and various
catalyst types for reaction temperatures ranging from 600 to 800 °C
with an increment of 50 °C. The detail of data measurement is
similar to that reported in our previous studies.45,46 The performance of DRB is characterized using CH4 conversion,
CO2 conversion, H2 yield, CO yield, and H2/CO ratio determined according to the following equations 7   8   9   10   11  

In these equations,
Fi, in and Fi, out are the molar flow
rates of species i at the reactor inlet and outlet, respectively.
Based on eqs 7–11, the CH4 conversion, CO2 conversion,
H2 and CO yields, and H2/CO ratio are shown
in Figure 3a–e.
Because DRB is an endothermic reaction, all of these performance parameters
increase with increased reaction temperatures, as shown in Figure 3a–e. From
the data shown in Figure 3, fairly stable variation with respect to time for each reaction
temperature was obtained for Ni and Pt–Ni catalysts. For the
Pt catalyst, unstable data resulted for low temperatures, but stable
data were obtained for the high temperatures. Poor DRB performance
from the Pt catalyst at low temperatures was obtained compared with
the Ni and Pt–Ni catalysts.

In Figure 4, the
averaged DRB performance as functions of reaction temperature and
catalyst type is shown based on the results obtained in Figure 3. As shown in Figure 4, the experimental results
are also compared with the equilibrium results predicted by Aspen
Plus (v.10.1) under the same operating conditions. From Figure 4, it can be seen that the difference
between experimental and equilibrium results at lower temperatures
is much greater than that at higher temperatures. This is attributed
to the reason that DRM is more pronounced at higher temperatures.
At lower temperatures, the experimental results are kinetically limited
while the equilibrium results are obtained by assuming infinite residence
time. From Figure 4a, it is clearly seen that higher CH4 conversion can be
obtained using bimetallic Pt–Ni catalysts. Low CH4 conversion results from the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst
for low reaction temperatures and CH4 conversion comparable
with other catalysts can only be obtained at high reaction temperatures.
This indicates that the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst can
only be activated at high reaction temperatures.47Figure 4b shows the CO2 conversion as a function of the reaction
temperature. The variation trend is similar to the CH4 conversion.
Note also that high CO2 conversion from the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst can be obtained for temperatures higher than
750 °C. By comparing Figure 4a,b, CO2 conversion is higher than CH4 conversion. This indicates the RWGS occurrence as described
in eq 2. Figure 4c,d shows the H2 and CO yields, respectively. Because of higher CH4 conversion,
higher H2 and CO yields can also be obtained from the 3wt%Pt-10wt%Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. Based on the results shown in Figure 4c,d, the H2/CO ratio is shown in Figure 4e. Due to RWGS, the H2/CO ratio is lower than 1.
As the reaction temperature increases, more H2 results
from CH4 decomposition and the H2/CO ratio approaches
one for all catalysts studied. The H2/CO ratio obtained
from the 3wt%Pt-10wt%Ni/Al2O3 catalyst is slightly
higher than that of other catalysts.

of the reaction temperature
for various types of catalysts. CH4/CO2/H2O = 1:1:0. (a) CH4 conversion, (b) CO2 conversion, (c) H2 yield, (d) CO yield, and (e) H2/CO ratio.

As shown in Figure 4b,d, the CO2 conversion and CO yield from
the Pt–Ni
catalyst are higher than the equilibrium case. This is because carbon
formation leading to less CO2 formation is included in
the equilibrium model. In addition, the difference can also be attributed
to side reactions taking place at higher temperatures, which would
be difficult to be included in any theoretical model. Moreover, the
mass and heat transfers in the catalytic fixed beds may be more pronounced
at higher temperatures and enhance the chemical reactions. Similar
results were also reported by Charisiou et al.48 and Rahemi et al.49

The
TGA/DTA test (STA6000, PerkinElmer, USA) was performed to examine
the carbon deposition onto the catalyst surface. The spent catalysts
for obtaining the results shown in Figure 4 are used as the samples in the TGA test
and the results are shown in Figure 5. From Figure 5, there are two weight loss ranges presented in TGA curves.
The weight loss observed below 400 °C may attribute to the oxidation
of volatile organic compounds and desorption of adsorbed water. The
weight loss observed over 600 °C may be attributed to the oxidation
of carbon.50,51 For the Ni catalyst, there is
about 35% of weight loss. For the Pt catalyst, about 29% of weight
loss is observed. For the Pt–Ni catalyst, there is about 15%
of weight loss. Because the weight loss is due to carbon oxidation,
the test results described above indicate that the Pt–Ni catalyst
has better carbon deposition resistance ability as compared with the
monometallic Pt or Ni catalyst.

Figure 5 TGA test results for catalysts used in
obtaining the results presented
in Figure 4.

From Figures 3, 4, and 5, the bimetallic Pt–Ni
catalyst exhibits superior activity and deactivation resistance compared
to those from corresponding monometallic catalysts. Bian et al.17 pointed out that the surface modification from
adding Pt atoms can effectively enhance the catalytic activities and
carbon resistance. It is also pointed out by García-Diéguez
et al.28 that the addition of Pt in Ni-based
catalysts can inhibit global carbon formation, promote the relative
content of active species, and avoid metal sintering, as well as improve
considerably the stability of the catalysts. According to the CO2-TPD study reported by Larimi and Khorash,43 Pt can be more evenly distributed on the catalyst surface
due to the interaction between Pt and Ni. The interaction between
Pt and Ni not only increases the type and number of surface adsorption
site of the catalyst but also promotes uniform distribution of the
catalyst surface.

2.3 Effect of CH4/CO2 Ratio
on DRB Performance without H2O Addition
Based
on the results shown in Figures 3, 4, and 5, the 3wt%Pt-10wt%Ni/Al2O3 catalyst has the
best performance among the catalysts studied. In the following, the
3wt%Pt-10wt%Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was used for further
study on DRB performance. Since the CO2 contained in biogas
is usually less than CH4, gas composition cases 1, 2, and
3 listed in Table S2 are used as the feedstock
for DRB and the performance is shown in Figure 6. Similar to Figure 4, the results shown in Figure 6 are based on the data from time-on-stream
measurement. Since CO2 plays a role similar to an oxidant
in the combustion reaction, more CO2 in the feedstock favors
the conversion of CH4 in the DRB.3,4 This
is clearly demonstrated in Figure 6a in which CH4 conversion decreases with
a decreased CO2 amount contained in the biogas. For the
CH4/CO2/H2O = 1:0.25:0 case, it is
seen that CH4 conversion becomes independent of the reaction
temperature when the reaction temperature is high. Because less CO2 is involved in the reaction, Figure 6b shows that higher CO2 conversion
is obtained as the CO2 amount is decreased. One hundred
percent CO2 conversion can be obtained for the CH4/CO2/H2O = 1:0.5:0 and 1:0.25:0 cases at high
temperatures. The H2 and CO yields shown in Figure 6c,d are basically similar to
the CH4 conversion shown in Figure 6a. Although a higher H2/CO ratio
results from the CH4/CO2/H2O = 1:0.25:0
case as shown in Figure 6e, the H2 and CO yields are lower compared with the CH4/CO2/H2O = 1:10.5:0 and 1:1:0 cases
as shown in Figure 6c,d.

for various CH4/CO2 ratios using 3wt%Pt-10wt%Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. (a) CH4 conversion, (b)
CO2 conversion, (c) H2 yield, (d) CO yield,
and (e) H2/CO ratio.

2.4 H2O Addition Effect on DRB Performance
The test results of the H2O addition effect on DRB performance
are shown in Figure 7. The gas composition with cases 4, 5, and 6 listed in Table S2 is used as the feedstock. Note that
the amount of H2O added is equal to that of CH4. Compared with Figure 6a in the case without H2O addition, Figure 7a shows that CH4 conversion can
be enhanced by H2O addition. This is due to the SRM reaction
as indicated in eq 5.
For the CH4/CO2/H2O = 1:1:1 case,
100% CH4 conversion can be reached at 800 °C. Compared
with Figure 6b in the
case without H2O addition, H2O addition results
in lower CO2 conversion, as shown in Figure 7b. With H2O added in the reaction
system, SRM is involved in the reaction. Along with SRM, the two other
reactions involved are the water-gas shift (WGS) and reverse CO2 methanation (RCM) reactions52 12   13  As shown from eqs 12 and 13,
more CO2 and H2 are produced from SRM, WGS,
and RCM. The CO2 production from WGS and RCM reactions
causes a decrease in CO2 conversion. As shown in Figure 7b, the CO2 conversion depends on the CO2 amount in the feedstock.
For CH4/CO2/H2O = 1:0.5:1 and 1:0.25:1
cases, negative CO2 conversion results from the low reaction
temperature regime. In these cases, methane steam reforming reactions
(eqs 5, 12, and 13) are dominant and more CO2 is produced with more H2O and less CO2 in the feedstock. Although CO2 can be consumed in DRM,
the reaction rate is low because of low temperatures. As a result,
negative CO2 conversion results due to more CO2 produced and less CO2 consumed. A similar result was
also reported from both thermodynamic analysis3,4 and
numerical modeling.53

of the reaction temperature for various CH4/CO2 ratios using 3wt%Pt-10wt%Ni/Al2O3 catalyst.
(a) CH4 conversion, (b) CO2 conversion, (c)
H2 yield, (d) CO yield, and (e) H2/CO ratio.

Figure 7c,d shows
the H2 and CO yields for DRB with H2O addition.
From Figure 7c,d, higher
H2 and CO yields can be obtained from biogas having less
CO2 amount. The reason for this result may be attributed
to the dominance of methane steam reforming reactions stated above
(eqs 5, 12, and 13). With less CO2 amount
involved in the DRB and with H2O addition, the methane
steam reforming reaction is more dominant than the dry reforming reaction.
As shown in eqs 5, 12, and 13, more H2 can be produced from steam reforming as compared with dry reforming.
That is, a higher H2 yield can be obtained with less CO2, as shown in Figure 7c. Although CO is consumed in the WGS reaction, the overall
CO production is higher in the SRM-dominated reaction system, resulting
in a higher CO yield, as shown in Figure 7d. For biogas containing more CO2, a higher CO2 amount is not favored for the SRM reaction,
leading to lower H2 and CO yields, as shown in Figure 7c,d. Because of a
higher H2 yield, Figure 7e shows that a higher H2/CO ratio than 1
can be obtained. For the CH4/CO2/H2O = 1:0.25:1, a H2/CO ratio with a value close to three
results at 600 °C and to 2.1 at 800 °C. This indicates the
dominance of SRM in the reaction as discussed above. As temperature
increases, the H2/CO ratio decreases due to the RWGS that
consuming H2 and producing CO.

2.5 Thermal Stability Test
Time-on-stream
tests with longer times were carried out to realize the thermal stability
of catalysts. In Figure 8a,b, the CH4 and CO2 conversions using 10wt%Ni/Al2O3 and 3wt%Pt-10wt%Ni/Al2O3 catalysts and gas composition of CH4/CO2/H2O = 1:0.5:0 at 700 °C are shown. As shown in Figure 8, the Pt–Ni/Al2O3 catalyst has better thermal stability than the
Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. In Figure 9, thermal stability was carried out under
the same conditions used in Figure 8 except that the reaction temperature was 800 °C
and the test time was longer. The test time of 72 h for the results
shown in Figure 9 is
comparable to that reported in the literature.40,54 From the results shown in Figure 8a,b, it is also indicated that the Pt–Ni/Al2O3 catalyst is more stable than the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. The results shown in Figures 8 and 9 indicate that
Pt addition improved the catalyst stability.

3 Conclusions
Syngas production via the
dry reforming process using simulated
biogas as the feedstock was experimentally studied. The monometallic
Ni and Pt and bimetallic Pt–Ni catalysts supported by Al2O3 were used as the catalysts. The CO2 amount contained in biogas and H2O addition effects on
the syngas production performance were investigated. The following
conclusions can be made based on the measured results presented:(1) The bimetallic Pt–Ni catalyst
has better activity compared with monometallic Ni or Pt catalysts.
Low activity from the Pt catalyst was found when the reaction temperature
is low.

(2) In the case
without H2O
addition, CH4 conversion decreased with the decreased CO2 amount contained in the biogas. Higher CO2 conversion
can be obtained because of less CO2 amount involved. The
yileds of H2 and CO are found to increase with an increased
CO2 amount because of higher CH4 conversion.

(3) For the H2O
addition case,
methane steam reforming is the dominant reaction when less CO2 amount is contained in the biogas. This results in higher
H2 and CO yields and negative CO2 conversion.
With a higher CO2 amount contained in the biogas, lower
H2 and CO yields resulted, indicating that methane steam
reforming is less dominant because of higher CO2 content.

(4) Long time-on-stream test
results show
that better thermal stability can be obtained from the bimetallic
Pt–Ni/Al2O3 catalyst.



4 Experimental Section
In this study,
Ni/Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, and
Pt–Ni/Al2O3 catalysts
were prepared using wetness incipient impregnation. The preparation
procedure and characterization of the catalyst were described in detail
in the previous studies.45,46 A schematic diagram
of the experimental setup is shown in Figure S1. Details regarding the reaction temperature control, flow rate regulation,
and test procedure were also described in the previous studies.45,46 Before the reaction tests, the in situ catalyst reduction was carried
out at a temperature determined by the H2-TPR test for
2 h in 50% H2/N2 at a flow rate of 50 mL/min.
The activity test was performed from 600 to 800 °C. The total
reactant volume flow was fixed at 50 sccm to focus on the catalyst
and reactant composition effect. As indicated in Table S2, the CH4 flow rate is taken as the reference
flow rate. The CH4/CO2 ratio is varied from
0.25 to 1 for simulating the biogas composition while N2 serves as the balance inert gas. For the H2O addition
cases, the amount of H2O added is equal to that of CH4.
