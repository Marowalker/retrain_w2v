Biocompatible and biodegradable polylactide
(PLA) composites with
supertough mechanical property and sufficient flame retardancy were
fabricated by employing a facile approach involving reactive blending
of PLA and ethylene-acrylic ester-glycidyl methacrylate terpolymer
(EGMA), with the addition of aluminum hypophosphite (AHP) as an effective
flame retardant. In consideration of the balance between mechanical
property and flame retardancy, the optimal formula was taking a PLA/EGMA
80/20 blend (supertough STPLA) as the matrix and adding 20 wt % of
AHP (relative to the mass of STPLA) as the flame retardant, coded
as STPLA/20AHP. The mechanical property test showed that for STPLA/20AHP
the elongation at break was increased by about 22 times and the notched
Izod impact strength was enhanced by approximately 11 times as compared
to those for neat PLA. The flame-retardant property test showed that
for STPLA/20AHP the limiting oxygen index value reached 26.6% and
the UL-94 V0 rating test was passed. Thermogravimetric analysis, microscale
combustion calorimetry, and cone calorimeter were further applied
to reveal the thermal stability and combustion behaviors of STPLA/xAHP, respectively, where x indicated the
mass content of AHP in percentage. The phase separation morphology,
dispersion of AHP particles in STPLA matrix, and fracture surfaces
and char residues after flame burning were examined by phase contrast
optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, respectively,
which helped comprehend the results obtained from the mechanical property
and flame retardancy tests. The supertough STPLA/xAHP, with sufficient flame retardancy as prepared in this work, could
have a potential for engineering applications.

1 Introduction
Polylactide
(PLA), as a promising bio-based polymer, has been paid
much attention.1−3 Due to its excellent properties, PLA has been widely
used in many fields, such as the packaging industry, household engineering,
and biomedical devices. The applications of PLA might further be expanded
to automotive materials, electronic appliances, and transportation.4,5 However, its mechanical and flame-retardant properties are insufficient
for use in these burgeoning applications.

Due to a low entanglement
density and high value of the characteristic
ratio, neat PLA possesses inherent brittleness, with the elongation
at a break of less than 10% and notched Izod impact strength of about
2 kJ/m2.6 Besides, the poor fire
resistance of PLA also restricts its further application and development
in the industrial fields mentioned above. Therefore, for the burgeoning
applications, simultaneously improving its mechanical properties,
especially notched Izod impact strength, and flame retardancy remains
the main challenge to be resolved.

Researchers attempted various
methods to improve the flame retardancy
of PLA materials in the past years.7−13 In particular, inorganic phosphorus-based intumescent flame retardants
have been used as flame-retardant additives for PLA and some effective
flame-retardant systems have been developed as well.14−22 Zhan et al. synthesized an intumescent flame retardant, spirocyclic
pentaerythritol bisphosphorate disphosphoryl melamine (named SPDPM),
and the PLA sample with 25 wt % loading of SPDPM reached UL-94 V0
rating and had a high limiting oxygen index (LOI) value of 38 vol
%.23 Stoclet et al. reported that addition
of 17 wt % halloysite decreased the peak intensity of the heat release
rate (PHRR) of a PLA/halloysite nanocomposite by 40% as compared to
that of PLA control.19 Réti et al.
introduced lignin and starch into an ammonium polyphosphate (APP)/bioresources
system for improving the flame retardancy of PLA.24 Their results showed that the flame-retarded PLA achieved
the UL-94 V0 rating at a loading of 40 wt % of the flame retardant.
Aluminum hydroxide,25 expanded graphite,26 and β-cyclodextrin27 were also used as other flame-retardant additives in the
past decades. However, the obvious disadvantage of the loading of
these flame retardants in such high contents is that the mechanical
properties of the PLA materials could diminish significantly.

Hence, with an aim of keeping a balance between the flame retardancy
and mechanical properties of PLA, reactive blending of the flame-retardant
PLA with the reactive polymer elastomer has been regarded as an effective
approach to improve the toughness. Reactive blending is
a cost-effective technique through which compatibilizers are produced
in situ by chemical reactions at the interface during mixing that
has been widely utilized to improve the toughness of PLA.28−31 For example, Oyama prepared high-performance PLA blends by reactive
blending of PLA with ethylene-acrylic ester-glycidyl methacrylate
terpolymer (EGMA), showing an increase of over 50 times in the impact
strength than that of neat PLA.32 Fang
et al. prepared supertough PLA materials through in situ reactive
blending of PLA with poly(ethylene glycol)-based diacrylate monomer
(PEGDA), showing improvements by a factor of 20 in the tensile roughness
and a factor of 26 in the notched Izod impact strength at the optimum
CPEGDA content.31 Liu et al. reported on
the preparation of supertough PLA ternary blends, consisting of PLA,
elastomeric ethylene-butyl acrylate-glycidyl methacrylate terpolymer
(EBA-GMA), and zinc ionomer of ethylene-methacrylic acid copolymer.33,34 Effective interfacial reactions between the epoxy groups of EBA-GMA
and the terminal groups of PLA were thought to be responsible for
significant increases in the notched Izod impact strength of the PLA
materials. Some other flexible polymers with reactive functional groups
have also been studied to improve the toughness of PLA through interfacial
reactions.35−38

The effective methods for preparing supertough PLA materials
have
shed light on the preparation of PLA materials with a balance between
their mechanical property and flame retardancy. In this work, we have
employed a facile approach for the preparation of PLA composites with
sufficient mechanical performance and flame retardancy. A detailed
analysis of the phase structure and morphology has been performed
to reveal the achieved balance between the mechanical and flame-retardant
properties. To the best of our knowledge, the approach to preparing
supertough PLA composites with sufficient flame retardancy in this
work might pave the way to its utilization in large-scale commercial
applications.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Supertough STPLA/xAHP
PLA, derived
from renewable resources as a promising bio-based polymer,
has attracted much attention because of its biodegradability, biocompatibility,
high mechanical strength, and excellent processability.39−42 However, the inherent poor toughness of PLA significantly limits
its use in a wide range of applications, such as in automotive and
packaging industries.43,44 The reactive blending of PLA
and EGMA might provide toughness improvement;45 certain multiphase blend systems on the basis of PLA/EGMA matrix
with improved mechanical or thermal properties have been reported.43,46,47 It has been predicted that the
glycidyl groups with high concentration (8%) in EGMA can react with
carboxyl and hydroxyl in PLA to form an effective interfacial layer,
which helps to improve greatly the toughness of PLA materials.

Figure 1 shows the
typical nominal stress–strain curves for PLA/EGMA 80/20 blend
(STPLA) and PLA/EGMA composites (STPLA/xAHP) with
different flame-retardant aluminum hypophosphite (AHP) contents. It
can be seen that PLA/EGMA 80/20 blend (STPLA) displays excellent tensile
toughness with an elongation at break of 310%, whereas the elongation
at break for neat PLA is just around 5.7%.31 Therefore, the improvement by 53 times in the elongation at break
demonstrates that PLA/EGMA 80/20 blend (STPLA) can be considered as
a supertough PLA material.31 With increasing
content of the added flame retardant, AHP into STPLA, the elongation
at break for STPLA/xAHP gradually decreases. Nevertheless,
for the flame-retardant AHP contents of 10 and 20 wt % the elongations
at break are still higher than 130%, which infers that STPLA/10AHP
and STPLA/20AHP are still supertoughened PLA composites for application
purpose. It is further noticed that even when the flame-retardant
AHP content is 30 wt % the elongation at break for STPLA/30AHP still
reaches 45%, which is far beyond that for neat PLA.

Figure 1 Typical nominal stress–strain
curves for STPLA (PLA/EGMA
80/20 blend) and its composites (STPLA/xAHP) with
different AHP contents.

The changes of yield strength, tensile modulus, tensile toughness,
and notched Izod impact strength as functions of AHP content for STPLA/xAHP are shown in Figure 2. As can be seen from Figure 2a, the incorporation
of AHP rigid particles as a flame retardant in STPLA can remedy certain
loss in yield strength or tensile modulus because the loss results
from the introduction of the soft elastomer EGMA. For example, when
AHP of 10 wt % is added in, the yield strength and tensile modulus
for STPLA/10AHP are 44 and 736 MPa, while these values for STPLA are
42 and 568 MPa, respectively. Further increase of the AHP content
results in a decrease in both the variables. Nonetheless, the tensile
moduli of STPLA/xAHP are still higher than that of
STPLA even when the AHP content reaches 30 wt %. As seen from Figure 2b, both the notched
Izod impact strength and tensile toughness continuously decrease with
increasing AHP content due to the rigid nature of AHP particles. Although
the notched Izod impact strength and tensile toughness deteriorate
with the addition of AHP, STPLA/xAHP is superior
to neat PLA. For example, the notched Izod impact strength for STPLA/40AHP
is 5.7 kJ/m2, nearly three times of that for neat PLA (1.9
kJ/m2). It will be presented in a later section that there
is no need to pursue the highest AHP content of 40 wt % for flame-retardant
purpose; as a matter of fact, an AHP content of 20 wt % is sufficient
for effective flame retardancy from the application viewpoint. The
notched Izod impact strength is about 22 kJ/m2 for STPLA/20AHP,
which is nearly 12 times of that for neat PLA. In short, the STPLA
matrix provides a broad platform for the incorporation of flame-retardant
AHP, and the addition of AHP can make some remedies to the rigidity
sacrifice resulting from the introduction of reactive soft elastomeric
EGMA.

Figure 2 Changes in yield strength and tensile modulus (a) and notched Izod
impact strength and tensile toughness (b) as functions of flame-retardant
AHP content for STPLA/xAHP with different AHP contents.
Note that the tensile toughness values were determined from the areas
under the nominal stress–strain curves.

2.2 Flame Retardancy for STPLA/xAHP
AHP was reported as an effective flame retardant for
polymers such as polyamide 6,6 and poly(ethylene terephthalate).48,49 In this study, the LOI and Underwriters Laboratories UL-94 tests
were performed to study the combustion behavior and determine the
flammability standard for each STPLA/xAHP composite.
The flammability test results are summarized in Table 1. Without addition of AHP, the LOI values
for neat PLA and STPLA are 19.5 and 19.0%, respectively and ratings
are not capable for these two samples according to the UL-94 rating.
The elastomeric component EGMA contains a large fraction of ethylene
co-monomer, which makes it more flammable than neat PLA. Figure S1 in the Supporting Information shows
the HRR and total heat release (THR) curves for neat PLA, EGMA, and
STPLA obtained from the cone calorimeter. EGMA has a PHRR of 2430
kW/m2, whereas the PHRR value for neat PLA is 1100 kW/m2. The THR values for EGMA are also much higher than those
for neat PLA at the later stage of testing. This result demonstrates
that EGMA is more flammable than neat PLA. When AHP of 10 wt % is
added, the LOI value of STPLA/10AHP increases to 24.1%; however, STPLA/10AHP
does not pass the UL-94 V0 rating test. Only when AHP of 20 wt % is
incorporated, the LOI value of STPLA/20AHP increases to 26.6% and
STPLA/20AHP also successfully passes the UL-94 V0 rating test. The
study of introducing AHP into neat PLA by Tang et al. showed that
the flame-resistant PLA composites reached the UL-94 V0 rating and
LOI value increased to 28.5% with AHP loading of 20 wt %, consistent
with our result.50 However, their PLA/AHP
composites had elongation at break of less than 4%, illustrating they
were typically very brittle PLA materials. Both neat PLA and STPLA
show a dripping phenomenon during the vertical-burning test. When
AHP of 10 wt % is added into the STPLA matrix, dripping is partially
inhibited. With an incorporation of AHP of 20 wt %, dripping is completely
inhibited. By further increasing AHP contents (30 and 40 wt %), STPLA/xAHP composites have even higher LOI values, show antidripping
performance, and pass the UL-94 V0 rating. In a comprehensive consideration
of the mechanical property and flame retardancy, STPLA/20AHP apparently
represents an optimal formula because it shows an elongation at break
of above 120%, a notched Izod impact strength of higher than 20 kJ/m2, and sufficient performance of flame retardancy. Such a balance
between mechanical and flame-retardant properties can surely broaden
the applications of PLA-based composites, especially in automotive
and electronic equipment industries.

2.3 Thermal Stability for STPLA/xAHP
The results from the UL-94 tests illustrate that AHP
behaves as an effective flame retardant for the PLA material. To investigate
the thermal stability behaviors of STPLA/xAHP, thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) measurements under nitrogen and air atmosphere were
applied, respectively. Figures 3 and 4 show the mass loss and derivative
mass loss curves from TGA measurements for neat PLA, STPLA, and STPLA/xAHP under nitrogen and air atmosphere, respectively. The
corresponding thermal stability parameters are listed in Tables 2 and 3. As shown in Figures 3a and 4a, the onset decomposition temperatures, T0.05 (defined as the temperature at which a
mass loss of 5% occurs), for STPLA/xAHP are all lower
than those for STPLA. As the AHP content increases, the T0.05 values slightly decrease, indicating that the flame-retardant
PLA composites have reduced thermal stability owing to the addition
of AHP. As shown in Figures 3b and 4b, neat PLA displays a singular Tmax at 385 °C under nitrogen atmosphere
and at 372 °C under air atmosphere, and STPLA displays another Tmax at around 469 °C under nitrogen atmosphere
and at around 446 °C under air atmosphere. Note that Tmax represents the temperature at the maximum
mass loss rate. With an addition of AHP in STPLA, an additional lower Tmax is seen at around 345 °C for nitrogen
atmosphere and at around 339 °C for air atmosphere. It becomes
obvious that the three Tmax’s should
correspond to the maximum mass loss rates for AHP, PLA, and EGMA components,
respectively, running from the low value to the high ones. There are
no obvious changes for the Tmax of the
PLA component with increasing AHP content under both nitrogen and
air atmosphere. The difference between the different testing atmospheres
in this study lies in that all PLA materials show higher values of T0.05 and Tmax under
nitrogen atmosphere than under air atmosphere, which is a common phenomenon
for polymer thermal stability. For flame-retardant
STPLA/xAHP, the thermal decomposition of AHP occurs
at first, which can be confirmed by the lower T0.05 values for STPLA/xAHP, the lowest Tmax values for AHP in the composites, and the
lower mass contents of residues than the initially added AHP contents
in the composites. When thermal decomposition occurs in AHP, it produces
phosphine (PH3) and water (H2O), which absorb
heat and dilute oxygen in air to suppress combustion.50 Besides, PH3 reacts with oxygen to produce phosphoric
acid (H3PO4), which acts as the acid source
to promote carbonization of the polymer matrix and then helps form
a carbon char on the sample surface to further separate oxygen from
the sample to restrict further combustion.50

2.4 Flammability of STPLA/xAHP
For evaluating the combustion property of materials, microscale
combustion calorimetry (MCC) is thought as one of the effective bench-scale
measurement systems. MCC only requires milligrams of the samples for
test. Basically, MCC uses an oxygen combustion calorimeter to measure
the rate and amount of heat produced by complete combustion of the
fuel gases generated during controlled heating of the sample.51Figure 5 shows the HRR curves obtained from the MCC test for neat
PLA, STPLA, and STPLA/xAHP with different AHP contents.
HRR is the most important parameter for evaluating the fire hazard
of materials from the MCC test, in which a low HRR value indicates
a low flammability with low full-scale hazards.51 As can be seen from Figure 5, the PHRR is apparently different from PLA to STPLA
as it is reduced from 372 W/g for PLA to 242 W/g for STPLA (a reduction
of 35%). Another PHRR with the value of 123 W/g can be seen at a higher
temperature, which can be attributed to the contribution of the EGMA
component in STPLA. Therefore, the reduction of PHRR of the PLA component
in STPLA itself indicates reduced fire hazards due to the introduction
of EGMA.

Figure 5 HRR curves obtained from MCC for neat PLA, STPLA, and STPLA/xAHP with different AHP contents.

The changes of PHRR, THR, and temperature at PHRR as functions
of AHP content for flame-retardant STPLA/xAHP with
different AHP contents are collectively shown in Figure 6. The comparative changing
trends of PHRR for PLA and EGMA follow similar decreases as the AHP
content increases (Figure 6a) and the THR follows a similar decreasing trend (Figure 6b), implying that
the presence of AHP can effectively reduce the fire hazards. The temperatures
at PHRR for both PLA and EGMA components in the composites do not
show obvious changes (Figure 6c), and PHRR at the lowest temperature is attributed to thermal
degradation of the AHP component. Results from the MCC test illustrate
that, besides AHP, the EGMA component also helps decrease fire hazards
for the flame-retardant STPLA/xAHP.

Figure 6 Changes in PHRR (a),
THR (b), and temperature at PHRR (c) obtained
from MCC as functions of the AHP content for flame-retardant STPLA/xAHP with different AHP contents.

The cone calorimeter is a useful bench-scale method for defining
the flame-retardant property of materials in real-world fire conditions.52 Therefore, the cone calorimeter was further
applied to examine the influence of the AHP content on flammability
of STPLA/xAHP. Figure 7 shows the HRR curves obtained from the cone calorimeter
for neat PLA, STPLA, and STPLA/xAHP. The HRR curve
is considered to be a powerful indicator for evaluating the fire hazardousness
of materials by quantifying the fire size and fire growth rate from
which the values of the time to ignition (TTI), PHRR, peak time of
HRR (Tp), and THR can be extracted.52 These values for neat PLA, STPLA, and STPLA/xAHP are listed in Table 4. As shown in Figure 7, neat PLA and STPLA burn quickly after an ignition
and have relatively narrow peaks and high peak intensities, with the
PHRR values as high as 1100 and 890 kW/m2, respectively.
The HRR curves for STPLA/xAHP become broadened and
the peak intensities decrease as well. STPLA/10AHP has a PHRR of 440
kW/m2 and STPLA/20AHP has an even lower PHRR value of 350
kW/m2, and no further obvious reduction in PHRR can be
found by further increasing the AHP content. For STPLA/xAHP, the THR values show a slight reduction as compared to those
of neat PLA and STPLA. The TTI value for neat PLA is about 50 s, while
that for STPLA/xAHP shifts to earlier times. As shown
in the TGA and MCC results, the AHP component decomposes at an earlier
time as compared with PLA and EGMA, and PLA is sensitive to the acid
species that result from the pyrolysis products of AHP, and thereby
an addition of AHP catalyzes the degradation of PLA and reduces the
TTI values.

Figure 7 HRR curves as measured from cone calorimeter for neat PLA, STPLA,
and STPLA/xAHP with different AHP contents.

2.5 Phase Separation Morphology Observed by PCOM
The phase separation morphology of STPLA (PLA/EGMA 80/20 blend)
and the dispersion of AHP particles in the STPLA matrix for STPLA/xAHP were observed by using phase contrast optical microscopy
(PCOM). The result is shown in Figure 8. Phase separation domains can be observed for STPLA
(micrograph not shown here), indicating that the EGMA component is
not fully miscible with the PLA matrix. However, due to obvious interfacial
reactions between the EGMA and PLA components, the phase domain boundary
is blurred and indistinct for STPLA. With the incorporation of AHP,
phase separation can still be visible, as shown in Figure 8. For STPLA/10AHP and STPLA/20AHP,
the flame-retardant AHP particles are relatively homogeneously dispersed
in the STPLA matrix with no obviously large AHP particle agglomeration,
whereas for STPLA/30AHP and STPLA/40AHP, large AHP particle agglomeration
can be clearly seen, as pointed out by the blue arrows in Figure 8, which is responsible
for deterioration of the mechanical property of STPLA/xAHP at these two highest AHP contents.

at 200 °C for STPLA/xAHP. The yellow scale bar
represents 50 μm and is applied to
all the micrographs. Large AHP particle agglomeration is illustrated
by blue arrows.

2.6 Fracture
Surface and Char Residue Morphologies
Observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
The fracture
surfaces of the notched Izod impact sample bars were examined by SEM,
and the typical SEM micrographs for neat PLA, STPLA, and STPLA/20AHP
are shown in Figure 9. A balance between the mechanical property and flame retardancy
is required for material applications. As discussed in a previous
section, STPLA/xAHP with the AHP content of 20 wt
% achieves a sufficient balance between its mechanical property and
flame retardancy. It can be seen from Figure 9a that neat PLA shows a smooth and almost
featureless fracture surface without much deformations, indicating
a typical brittle fracture behavior. The fracture surface of STPLA
displays a rugged feature (Figure 9b), indicating that the PLA matrix experiences shear
yielding during mechanical deformation, which can be induced by cavitation
of the rubbery EGMA phase domains. With the incorporation of the AHP
particles, the fracture surface of STPLA/20AHP still displays a rugged
feature (Figure 9c),
indicating a similar mechanical deformation mechanism for the composite.
In addition, it can be seen from Figure 9c that some AHP particles insert into the
STPLA matrix and certain voids can be found around these AHP particles,
indicating poor adhesion between the AHP particles and STPLA matrix,
which is responsible for the relative decrease in notched Izod impact
strength as compared to that of STPLA.

Figure 9 SEM micrographs taken
on the fracture surfaces of the notched Izod
impact sample bars for neat PLA (a), STPLA (b), and STPLA/20AHP (c).

Figure 10 shows
the SEM micrographs of the char residues of STPLA/20AHP. A continuous
char layer at the char surface is clearly seen in Figure 10a, which evidences the flame
retardancy. When observed under high magnification as shown in Figure 10b, the char residue
particles in the continuous layer look compact and dense with several
sparse crater-like structures existing, which may have resulted from
the thermally released gas products from the degradation of AHP. Overall,
the SEM micrographs confirm sufficient flame retardancy for STPLA/20AHP.

3 Conclusions
In this
work, supertough flame-resistant PLA composites were successfully
prepared by using economically effective reactive melt blending approach.
PLA and EGMA were reactively blended in the molten state as a polymer
matrix with a mass ratio of 80/20, which provided the supertough mechanical
property, coded as STPLA, and then the composites STPLA/xAHP were prepared with a continuous mixing with AHP as an effective
flame retardant, where x represented the mass contents
of AHP relative to the mass of STPLA. Taking the optimal formula as
a typical example, STPLA/20AHP successfully passed the UL-94 V0 rating
in the UL-94 test, had an LOI value of 26.6% and showed an antidripping
phenomenon, indicating its sufficient flame retardancy for application
purpose; in the mechanical property aspect, STPLA/20AHP showed an
elongation at break of 131% during the tensile test and a notched
Izod impact strength of 22 kJ/m2, nearly 23 and 12 times
of that of neat PLA, respectively, reflecting its supertough mechanical
property. TGA was applied to examine the thermal decomposition behavior,
and MCC and cone calorimeter were further applied to examine the combustion
property for STPLA/xAHP, which revealed the possible
flame-retardant mechanisms. PCOM was used to observe the phase separation
morphology and dispersion of AHP particles in the STPLA matrix, which
indicated that the mechanical deformation mechanism of STPLA/xAHP was related to the interfacial layers formed during
reactive blending and the degree of formation of heterogeneous AHP
agglomeration. Finally, SEM was used to observe the fracture surfaces
of the notched Izod impact sample bars and the surfaces of char residues
after combustion for further understanding of the flame-retardant
mechanism. In summary, the approach employed in this work might broaden
the applications of PLA materials, which might release some environmental
pressure.

4.2 Reactive Melt Blending
PLA and AHP
were dried at 60 °C, and EGMA was dried at 40 °C under vacuum
for 12 h prior to melt blending. PLA and EGMA with a mass ratio of
80/20 were mixed at a rotor speed of 80 rpm and 200 °C for 8
min by using an XSS-300 torque rheometer. Subsequently, AHP of certain
amounts was added in for another 4 min mixing. In this study, the
PLA/EGMA 80/20 blend was denoted as the polymer matrix and AHP mass
contents were chosen to be 10, 20, 30, and 40 wt %, relative to the
mass of the PLA/EGMA 80/20 blend. For simplicity, the PLA/EGMA 80/20
blend is coded as STPLA (supertough PLA), and the PLA composites,
with addition of AHP of various amounts, are coded as STPLA/xAHP, where x indicates the mass contents
of AHP in percentage.

4.3 Mechanical Property Testing
STPLA
and STPLA/xAHP were hot pressed at 200 °C under
a pressure of 10 MPa for 5 min into sheets with a thickness of about
1 mm, using a homemade vacuum laminator and then were quenched to
room temperature. Dumbbell-shaped samples were punched out from the
molded sheets for mechanical tensile property test. The tensile property
was measured at room temperature according to ASTM 638 by using an
electronic universal tensile test machine (Suns, Shenzhen, China)
at a crosshead speed of 10 mm/min. The notched Izod impact strength
test was performed by using an XJUD-5.5 pendulum impact tester (JinJian-test,
China). The size of the rectangular specimen was 100 × 10 ×
3 mm3, with a 45° V-shaped notch (upper radius of
0.25 mm and depth of 2 mm). The average values from measurements on
five specimens were used for data analysis.

4.4 Flame
Retardancy Testing
LOI measurements
were carried out using an HC-2 oxygen index meter (Nanjing Jiangning
Analysis Instrument Ltd., China) according to ASTM D2863-97. The size
of the specimens was 130 × 6.5 × 3.2 mm3. The
UL-94 vertical tests were carried out using a CZF-1 type instrument
(made in china). The size of the specimens was 130 × 13 ×
3 mm3. In the UL-94 tests, the specimens were vertically
exposed to a Bunsen burner flame for a period of 10 s. If the flame
was extinguished, another period of 10 s was employed. The UL-94 rating
for STPLA/xAHP was determined according to ANSL/UL-94-2009.

4.5 Thermal Stability Property Measurement
A Q5000 IR thermogravimetric analyzer (TA Instruments) was used for
the TGA. Alumina crucibles were used. The masses of the samples were
about 5–10 mg. The measurement temperature ranged from room
temperature to 600 °C, and the heating rate was 20 °C/min.
The measurements were performed under nitrogen and air atmosphere,
respectively. The temperature at which the original sample mass of
5% was lost was defined as the onset decomposition temperature. The
temperature with the maximum mass loss rate was defined as Tmax for each component in the sample.

4.6 Combustion Property Testing
The combustion
property of the samples was probed by using MCC (model FAA-PCFC; Fire
Testing Technology); 4–6 mg of each sample were used. The sample
was heated from 100 to 650 °C at 1 °C/s in a nitrogen stream,
with a flow rate of 8 × 10–5 m3/min.
Prior to flowing into a 900 °C combustion furnace, the volatile
anaerobic thermal degradation products in the nitrogen stream were
mixed with an oxygen stream with a flow rate of 2 × 10–5 m3/min. The cone calorimeter test was performed on a
cone calorimeter (Fire Testing Technology, U.K.) according to ASTM
E1354/ISO 5660. The size of the specimens was 100 × 100 ×
3 mm3. Each specimen was wrapped in an aluminum foil and
exposed horizontally to a 35 kW/m2 external heat flux.

4.7 Phase Separation Observation by PCOM
To
examine the miscibility between PLA and EGMA in STPLA in the melt
state and dispersion of AHP in the STPLA matrix for STPLA/xAHP, PCOM (Olympus BX51) was applied to observe the phase
separation morphology. The film samples of
the blend and composites were melted at 200 °C for 2 min before
the PCOM micrographs were taken.

4.8 Fracture
Surface and Residue Observation by
SEM
To evaluate the mechanical deformation and flame-retardant
mechanisms, the impact fractured surfaces of the samples and char
residues after combustion of STPLA and STPLA/20AHP were sputter-coated
with gold and then the surface morphologies were examined by using
a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI, Sirion200).
