Stacking interactions
have been evaluated, employing computational
methods, in dimers formed by analogous aliphatic and aromatic species
of increasing size. Changes in stability as the systems become larger
are mostly controlled by the balance of increasing repulsion and dispersion
contributions, while electrostatics plays a secondary but relevant
role. The interaction energy increases as the size of the system grows,
but it does much faster in π–π dimers than in σ–π
complexes and more remarkably than in σ–σ dimers.
The main factor behind the larger stability of aromatic dimers compared
to complexes containing aliphatic molecules is related to changes
in the properties of the aromatic systems due to electron delocalization
leading to larger dispersion contributions. Besides, an extra stabilization
in π–π complexes is due to the softening of the
repulsive wall in aromatic species that allows the molecules to come
closer.

Introduction
Noncovalent interactions
involving π systems are crucial
in a wide variety of chemical, physical, and biological processes.1,2 The role of aromatic π interactions is evident in the case
of proteins, considering that there are several amino acids bearing
an aromatic ring in their side chains. These aromatic side chains
can be involved in specific interactions affecting the protein structure
and function, acting in a different way compared to aliphatic amino
acids.3−6 Aromatic interactions also play a significant role in materials
science and, more specifically, in extended π systems of evident
interest as carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, graphene, and their derivatives
that mostly interact by means of π interactions.1,7,8

In most cases, when an aromatic
unit interacts with another species,
the interaction corresponds to one of the three following motifs:
π···π stacking, XH···π
contact, and ion···π interaction.5,9 Cation···π interactions are a well-established
interaction pattern in proteins, and different studies indicate that
their main stabilizing factor is electrostatics but with significant
contributions from induction or even dispersion in the case of larger
organic cations.6,10−16 A similar behavior has been observed for the more novel anion···π
interactions, though in this case, the role of dispersion is usually
larger.17−21 The XH···π interactions are usually weaker
than the ion···π ones, and resemble a hydrogen
bond with the aromatic cloud acting as an acceptor. Though weaker
than ion···π interactions, the combination of
several XH···π interactions can deeply affect
the characteristics of the systems.22,23

The
stacking interaction between aromatic rings has been recognized
for a long time as one of the key interacting motifs contributing
to the stability of systems containing aromatic substituents.3,5,24 This kind of interaction has
been widely studied, especially for the prototypical benzene dimer.25−29 For some time, it has been commonplace to consider that π
stacking interactions were a sort of interaction type with some special
characteristics compared to aliphatic structures. However, this view
has changed in recent years, and the term stacking has been put into
question as π systems do not tend to stack because of repulsion
between the π electron clouds.30,31 In consequence,
caution is required to describe the effect of π-systems in chemical
or biological systems.

The main stabilizing factor in stacked
π–π structures
is dispersion.12,32,33 Because the dispersion contribution is present in any system, favorable
stacking interactions are also possible among aliphatic species. In
fact, it has been shown that the interaction in the cyclohexane dimer
is similar in magnitude to that of the benzene dimer, and the cyclohexane···benzene
dimer is more tightly bound than benzene or cyclohexane homodimers.32,34,35 The stacked dimers formed by
benzene and cyclohexane have quite similar stabilities, as a result
of a balance between different contributions: homodimers show a more
important role of dispersion, while electrostatics is slightly larger
in the heterodimer.32,36

Therefore, if π–π,
σ–π, and
σ–σ interactions can provide similar stability,
all should be considered for understanding the behavior of multitude
of systems, as well as for engineering new supramolecular receptors
or functional molecules. However, the behavior observed for small
dimers not necessarily has to be the same in extended systems. It
has been recently shown that layers of graphene and graphane have
similar stabilities, though the values for graphane are significantly
smaller, indicating that as the system grows, aromatic stacking interactions
somehow strengthen relative to aliphatic ones.37

Different studies have been carried out in order
to determine how
aromatic and aliphatic stacking interactions behave as the size of
the system grows.31,38−42 In a pioneering work, Grimme et al. studied the stacking
interactions in homodimers of linear acenes up to tetracene in stacked
and T-shaped arrangements, and compared the results to those obtained
for their stacked aliphatic counterparts.31 The authors indicate that the interaction energy grows faster in
aromatic dimers than in aliphatic ones, suggesting that the effect
is due to intermolecular distance shortening in aromatic dimers as
well as to some kind of cooperative effect, absent in aliphatic dimers,
and mainly associated with dispersion. These results were further
refined and the main conclusions remained the same, though the use
of a different model for dispersion greatly improves the description
of aliphatic stacked structures.38 Janowski
and Pulay carried out high-level calculations on dimers of naphthalene
and coronene as well as their hydrogenated counterparts, concluding
again that σ-stacking energies are substantial though significantly
weaker than π-stacking interactions.39

Alonso et al. employed the noncovalent interaction index in
order
to assess the characteristics of the interaction in benzene, naphthalene,
and anthracene dimers and their perhydrogenated counterparts.40 The authors found that dispersion interactions
involving hydrogen atoms are the reason behind the stabilization in
aliphatic dimers. Also, while aliphatic interactions are inherently
localized, the delocalized character of π–π interactions
gives rise to the extra stabilization observed in aromatic dimers
as the system grows. Yuan at al. have shown that the interaction in
mixed graphene/graphane systems is roughly additive in the number
of CH···π contacts,43 while the same conclusion has been reached by Wang et al. in graphane
dimers.37 Guijarro et al. have also shown
that sublimation energies of acenes behave linearly with the number
of atoms and can be traced back to the presence of dispersion-dominated
C–H···π interactions.44

A more detailed analysis of the nature of the interaction
can be
obtained by means of symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) methods
that allow computing different contributions to the stability associated
with well-defined physical terms.45,46 In this respect,
it is worth mentioning the work of Podeszwa et al. on several aromatic
complexes including the coronene dimer.47,48 The results
confirm that dispersion is clearly dominant. A similar conclusion
has been reached by Hohenstein et al. for linear acene dimers, showing
that dispersion grows faster in aromatic systems than in aliphatic
ones.42 A thorough exploration of the potential
energy surface of linear acene dimers by Ryno et al. unveils the role
of electrostatic penetration effects on the stability of these systems,
accounting for up to 50% of the total interaction energy.41 The results obtained by Gryn’ova et al.
also highlight the relevance of penetration effects on hydrocarbon
dimers.49

However, it has to be indicated
that these results have been obtained
using a moderate set of systems, or employing the SAPT0 level. SAPT0
uses HF wavefunctions and though it has been shown to be capable of
providing reasonable values for a variety of systems, it relays on
large error compensation.50 Also, in most
of the works commented above, σ–π dimers correspond
to linear acene homodimers in T-shaped orientation, but no studies
are performed for mixed aliphatic–aromatic dimers.

Figure 1 summarizes
the systems considered in this work: linear acenes from benzene to
hexacene, as well as nonlinear polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
as pyrene, perylene, and coronene; besides these π species,
their perhydrogenated counterparts are also considered (cyclohexane,
decalin, etc.). Homodimers formed by the different aromatic species
are employed to study the characteristics of the π–π
stacking interactions, while homodimers formed by the perhydrogenated
molecules are used to study σ–σ stacking interactions.
Finally, heterodimers comprising one of the PAHs and its perhydrogenated
counterpart are used to study σ–π interactions.
Following Podeszwa,47 for each of these
dimers, four different orientations have been considered as also shown
in Figure 1. These
orientations correspond to a dimer with the units just stacked above
each other (stack), a stacked structure where one of
the units is rotated by 90° (cross), and two stacked
structures (slip and glike) where one molecule
is displaced. glike corresponds to an arrangement similar
to that observed in graphite.

Figure 1 Molecules considered in this work (top) and
the relative orientations
(bottom) considered for the dimers studied. A σ–π
case is shown for a dimer formed by anthracene with its perhydrogenated
derivative. In glike and slip orientations, the molecules are displaced
by 1.45 Å as indicated by the arrows (see text).

Comparing the results obtained for the total interaction
energies
as well as for their components could reveal the intrinsic differences
of the interaction in σ–σ, σ–π,
and π–π complexes, helping to understand why π
interactions are favored over σ ones as the system grows.

Results
and Discussion
Potential energy curves are obtained for the
dimers studied, considering
the relative orientations shown in Figure 1, and the minimum of each curve is obtained
by interpolation (at the TPSS-D3BJ/def2-TZVPP level, see Computational Methods; the full set of results is
shown in Figure S1 and Tables S2 and S3, Supporting
Information). Employing these minima, the interaction energies
are obtained with a more robust method (MP2.X, see Table S4, Supporting Information), and these are the values
used for discussion as summarized in Figure 2. The plot on the top corresponds to systems
showing π–π interactions; that is, homodimers formed
by the linear acenes up to hexacene and also dimers of pyrene, perylene,
and coronene. As observed in Figure 2 (top) and in accordance with previous work,27,28,32 the most stable benzene dimer
corresponds to the glike or slip orientations,
that in this case correspond to the same structure. Other relative
orientations such as the stack and the cross ones are significantly less stable (see Figure 1 for a representation of these orientations).
It has to be remembered here that only parallel stacked structures
are considered, so no T-shaped minima have been taken into account.
The interaction energy amounts to around −3.0 kcal mol–1 in glike/slip, while it
only reaches −1.9 kcal mol–1 for the other
structures.

Figure 2 Interaction energies obtained at the MP2.X level for the different
kind of interactions considered. Cn and
orientations as defined in Figure 1.

In the case of the naphthalene
dimer, the most stable minimum is
again the glike structure, while the slip and cross ones are less stable by around 0.5 kcal mol–1. On the other hand, the stack structure
is the least stable one, as it will be the case with the rest of unsaturated
species studied. The results are also in agreement with the values
found in literature, with slight differences depending on the level
of calculation employed in each case.39,47 In the naphthalene
dimer, the cross structure is more favored than in the
benzene dimer because it allows closer proximity between carbon atoms
facilitating dispersion interactions. The anthracene dimer shows a
similar behavior, with the glike structure being the
most stable, though in this case, the cross structure
is almost as stable and about 0.5 kcal mol–1 more
favorable than the slip one. These results are also in
line with previous results in the literature;47 in the crossed anthracene dimer, all rings have another ring close
by, so dispersion and stability are enhanced. In larger linear acene
dimers, glike structures are the most stable followed
by the slip ones. As the size of the acene grows, the glike structure more clearly becomes the preferred orientation,
while cross and stack minima become relatively
more and more unstable (though the interaction energy increases with
system size, cross structures put atoms on the edges
of the molecules too far away). Only the slip structures
show stabilities comparable to the glike ones, though
around 1 kcal mol–1 less stable. Figure 2 also shows the values obtained
for dimers of the nonlinear acenes: pyrene, perylene, and coronene.
In these cases, the dependence on the orientation is less clear: in
the pyrene dimer, the slip structure is slightly favored
over glike, while in the perylene dimer, the cross minimum is the most favorable. Coronene favors glike/slip minima (they are the same structure); stack structures are by far less stable.

The middle section of Figure 2 shows the results
obtained for homodimers of the perhydrogenated
derivatives of the molecules considered above. Quite recently, the
importance of aliphatic stacking interactions has been recognized,
with evidences supporting their important role on the stability, with
contributions of similar magnitude as the aromatic stacking. These
stacking interactions between aliphatic systems are usually weaker
than those observed between aromatic species but still noticeable,
as already indicated in the case of the perhydrocoronene dimer.39 Focusing on the results shown in Figure 2, and contrary to the results
observed in aromatic systems, the most favorable orientation in dimers
formed by hydrogenated species is the fully stacked one, with the
molecules just lying one on top of another. With this orientation,
all axial C–H groups are distributed in an alternated way,
thus avoiding steric clashes and facilitating C–H···C
interactions, as already suggested by Alonso et al.40glike structures are the second most stable
ones by around 1 kcal mol–1.

Finally, the
bottom section of Figure 2 shows the results obtained for heterodimers
formed by one aromatic species and its perhydrogenated counterpart.
Recently, it has been shown that the interaction in these mixed dimers
can be stronger than both σ–σ and π–π
structures.32,35 The stabilization can be associated
to the presence of CH···π interactions, though
in previous work it has been shown that the main contribution is still
dispersion.32 As in π–π
complexes, the most favorable orientation of the dimers is the glike one, allowing the formation of CH···π
interactions. However, both the slip and stack structures are slightly weaker but with very similar stabilities,
so it becomes clear that when talking about CH···π
interactions, the directionality is not very relevant.

For all
kinds of dimers considered, there is an increase in interaction
energies as the size of the system grows as a consequence of the larger
number of favorable contacts established between both molecules (there
is an increase in the contact surface). This is clearly the case for
linear acenes, with the only exception of cross structures.
In this case, the interaction reaches a plateau for the anthracene
dimer and increases to a less extent in larger systems. While the
interaction energies increase with the number of carbon atoms, it
does so to a different degree depending on the type of the complex
considered. While π–π and σ–π
complexes show interaction energies growing in a similar fashion,
σ–σ complexes increase their energy at a slower
rate, in agreement with previous results indicating that π–π
complexes benefit from some kind of cooperativity as compared to aliphatic
contacts.31,38,40,42 In any case, for the three types of complexes considered,
a pretty good linear relationship is observed with the number of atoms
(see Figure S2, Supporting Information). This
linear relationship is especially good, considering the behavior of
linear acenes, with the exception of cross structures,
as expected. For the other structures considered, a good linear fit
is obtained even when the nonlinear acene dimers are included, with
linear regressions showing R2 > 0.99
in
all cases. The slopes of these linear fits already indicate how the
interaction energies increase faster for π–π dimers;
in σ–π complexes, the rate is slightly smaller,
and clearly smaller in σ–σ complexes.

Table 1 summarizes
how the interaction energy changes for the most stable structures
found for the complexes studied (remember that this corresponds in
most cases to glike in σ–π and π–π
complexes, and to stack in σ–σ ones).
As already found in previous work, the cyclohexane dimer is slightly
less stable than the benzene dimer, which in turn is less stable than
the cyclohexane···benzene dimer. This has been attributed
to dispersion contributions of similar magnitude but larger electrostatic
terms in the σ–π complex, associated to the CH···π
interactions.32 It becomes clear from Table 1 and Figure S3 that as the size of the system grows the stability
increases at different rates for the aliphatic and aromatic dimers.

Already naphthalene dimer is as
stable as its mixed aliphatic–aromatic
counterpart and for larger systems, the stability of the aromatic
dimers is always larger than for the mixed ones, though the differences
are not especially large. In aromatic dimers, the interaction energies
increase from −3.0 kcal mol–1 of the benzene
dimer to −20.8 kcal mol–1 of the coronene
dimer, while in mixed dimers, the energy changes from −3.4
to −18.9 kcal mol–1. Even though the interaction
energy increases as we move from the cyclohexane dimer to the perhydrocoronene
dimer, passing from −2.5 to −12.6 kcal mol–1, the increment is larger for mixed and aromatic dimers. These results
are similar to others in the literature employing a smaller subset
of species, and have been interpreted considering that in the case
of π–π interactions, there is some kind of a cooperative
effect that makes dimers of larger systems more stable.31,38,42

However, if the incremental
interaction energies are considered
as one more ring is fused to a linear acene, the differences between
the complexes are not large. Because the interaction energies change
linearly with the number of carbon atoms, the incremental stability
when fusing a new ring in linear acenes is constant, amounting to
−3.9 kcal mol–1. The energy change is slightly
smaller in σ–π complexes, amounting to −3.5
kcal mol–1, while it is even less negative in σ–σ
dimers (−2.2 kcal mol–1). Therefore, not
only the cyclohexane dimer is slightly less stable than the benzene
dimer but also the aliphatic complexes become less stabilized as the
systems grow, leading to significantly less stable complexes than
their aromatic counterparts. This effect is not cooperative in the
sense of being reinforced as the size grows, but a constant difference
due to the different nature of the interactions. Therefore, there
is a size effect in the sense that as the size of the system grows,
the stability becomes larger for all complexes, but increases more
quickly for π–π complexes than for σ–π
ones, and even faster than for σ–σ ones. There
is not a cooperative effect leading to a reinforced stability as the
system grows, in agreement with the linear changes in interaction
energies with the number of carbon atoms. The observed stability gain
going from the benzene dimer to the anthracene dimer is similar to
that obtained going from anthracene to pentacene dimers, and the same
happens for mixed and aliphatic dimers.

SAPT(DFT) allows obtaining
the interaction energy as a sum of different
terms with a clear physical nature. Also, it can provide with accurate
values for the interaction energies as already shown in the literature.51−53Figure 3 compares
the values obtained with SAPT(DFT) with those at the MP2.X level (the
full set of values is listed in Tables S4 and S5) for the most stable dimers. As observed in Figure 3, the values obtained for the
interaction energies at the SAPT(DFT) level closely reproduce the
results obtained with MP2.X. There are of course some deviations,
most noticeably in the case of mixed dimers, but overall, it can be
concluded that SAPT(DFT) is capable of reproducing the results obtained
with MP2.X. Therefore, it can be considered that the representation
of the interaction obtained from SAPT(DFT) is a sound one.

Figure 3 Comparison

interaction energies as the size of the system grows. Only the most
stable orientation of each dimer is included.

Figure 4 shows
the
results obtained for the different contributions to the interaction
energy for the most stable dimers found for each type of complex considered
in this work (the values are listed in Table S7 and a different view is shown in Figure S4). Beginning with π–π complexes, the results indicate,
as it is already known, that the benzene dimer is mainly bound by
dispersion, with small contributions from electrostatics and tiny
induction. The most remarkable changes when going from the benzene
dimer to the naphthalene dimer correspond to the largest contributions,
namely dispersion and repulsion. These two contributions roughly double
their values, as it is the case with the tiny induction term. On the
other hand, electrostatics increases by a factor of three, though
this is probably due to its small value in the benzene dimer as compared
to other dimers. Considering the anthracene dimer, there is a neat
increase in repulsion and dispersion, which are the leading contributions
to the interaction energy. Again, the relative increment in electrostatics
is slightly larger than for any of the other contributions. A similar
behavior is observed in larger systems. When considering nonlinear
acenes as in pyrene, perylene, and coronene dimers, the results are
also in line with those observed for linear acenes and roughly lie
where expected, considering the number of carbon atoms of the systems.

Figure 4 Variation
of the SAPT(DFT) components of the interaction energy
for the most stable structure of the dimers studied. Cn as in Figure 1.

The behavior is similar in dimers
formed by aliphatic molecules,
though the global quantities differ significantly from the values
obtained in aromatic dimers. As in the benzene dimer, the cyclohexane
dimer is mainly bound by dispersion, though in cyclohexane, the electrostatic
component is more favorable, while induction is negligible (see previous
work).32 All terms roughly double when
passing from the cyclohexane dimer to the decalin dimer and increasing
the size of the systems leads to similar increments in all terms.
In the case of mixed dimers, an intermediate behavior is observed.
The cyclohexane–benzene dimer is also bound by dispersion,
though it displays a slightly larger electrostatic character. The
ratios of change as the system grows are between those observed in
aliphatic and aromatic dimers, so dispersion and repulsion increase
more slowly than in aromatic dimers.

The general trend (see
also Figure S4) shows that all contributions
change faster with the number of carbon
atoms in π–π dimers. While repulsion and dispersion
are quite similar in the case of the smallest complexes of each kind,
the values quickly depart from each other as the size of the system
grows. As a consequence, π–π dimers show larger
dispersion and repulsion components as the system grows, and the same
trend is observed for total interaction energies. Repulsion grows
more slowly in mixed and aliphatic dimers than in aromatic ones, though
this is clearly compensated in aromatic dimers by the larger increment
in dispersion. In the case of σ–π complexes, dispersion
grows quicker than in aliphatic ones, and the same is observed for
repulsion. Though changes in electrostatics and induction are much
smaller, and occur at a much smaller scale than changes in repulsion
and dispersion, the electrostatic term also grows faster in aromatic
complexes, so for both σ–π and π–π
complexes, it reaches −12 kcal mol–1, compared
to barely −10 kcal mol–1 in aliphatic dimers.
Thus, even though the cyclohexane–benzene dimer has a larger
electrostatic component than the benzene dimer, already in pentacene
dimers the contributions are similar, so the electrostatic contribution
also grows faster in aromatic dimers. The same is observed for induction,
which only in the case of π–π complexes is relevant,
reaching almost −5 kcal mol–1. Therefore,
all contributions to the stability seem to grow faster in aromatic
complexes than in both σ–π and σ–σ
complexes, so the former ones are favored as the system grows.

Overall, it can be considered that the stability of these complexes
mainly comes from a balance of the opposing effects of dispersion
trying to bring the molecules closer and the repulsion term avoiding
it. The final stability is then tuned with the smaller electrostatic
and induction contributions. An interesting aspect of the results
in Figure 4 is that
the main changes affect dispersion and repulsion, occurring on a different
scale than changes in electrostatic or induction, which are much smaller
contributions. It can be observed, however, that the variations in
dispersion and repulsion nearly cancel each other, so the final changes
in energy are more dependent on the smaller electrostatic and induction
terms. In a very simple description of the interaction both dispersion
and repulsion depend on the number of atoms at close distance, as
it would be the case in a Lennard-Jones model. If dispersion and repulsion
are combined (Figure 5), the energy change from benzene to pentacene amounts to −3
kcal mol–1 in π–π complexes and
to only −1.2 kcal mol–1 in σ–σ
ones. Thus, dispersion and repulsion quench each other almost totally,
so the final stability is more controlled by electrostatics. In Figure 5, it can be observed
that the contributions from induction and electrostatics, and the
combination of dispersion and repulsion are of similar magnitude.
Considering aromatic dimers, it can be observed that the combination
of dispersion and repulsion is always favorable, and increases as
the size of the system grows. Thus, both terms contribute a net −1.4
kcal mol–1 in the benzene dimer, increasing to −4.4
kcal mol–1 in the pentacene dimer or −5.9
kcal mol–1 in the coronene dimer. However, induction,
which contributes with just −0.5 kcal mol–1 in the benzene dimer, amounts to −3.4 kcal mol–1 in the pentacene dimer and −3.2 kcal mol–1 in the coronene dimer. Thus, the stability of the complexes increases
by quite similar amounts because of the combined effect of repulsion
+ dispersion and induction. Finally, a look at electrostatics reveals
a totally different behavior. While electrostatics is small in the
benzene dimer amounting to −0.8 kcal mol–1, it grows quickly, reaching −10 kcal mol–1 in the pentacene dimer and −12 kcal mol–1 in the coronene dimer. Therefore, the increase in stability of the
complexes could be also associated with the increment on electrostatic
contribution as the size grows. This increase in electrostatic energy
could be related, at least partially, to penetration effects that
become larger as the distance between monomers decrease and that would
explain the growth in this contribution.41,49 While the combination of repulsion + dispersion or induction changes
by −4 kcal mol–1, electrostatics varies by
−9 kcal mol–1, so being mainly responsible
for stability changes.

Figure 5 SAPT(DFT) decomposition for the most stable structure
of the dimers
studied. Repulsion and dispersion are grouped together. Cn as in Figure 1.

In aliphatic dimers, all contributions
are smaller. The combination
of repulsion + dispersion is favorable and increases by just −1.5
kcal mol–1 on going from the cyclohexane dimer to
the perhydropentacene dimer. On the other hand, even though the electrostatic
term changes noticeably when increasing the system size (from −1.34
in the cyclohexane dimer to −9.9 kcal mol–1 in the perhydropentacene dimer), its contribution is always smaller
than that observed for aromatic dimers, as it is also the case of
induction.

In the case of the heterodimers, the behavior is
very similar to
the one observed in aromatic dimers. While the electrostatic term
is similar to that observed in aromatic dimers (even slightly favoring
mixed dimers), the combined dispersion + repulsion term grows to a
less extent than in aromatic dimers. This, combined with a less favorable
induction contribution makes σ–π complexes less
stable than π–π ones. Thus, aromatic dimers are
more stable than aliphatic ones because of the combined effect of
all stabilizing contributions, with electrostatics playing a significant
role, while energy differences with mixed dimers are not related with
electrostatics but with rather small favorable induction and dispersion
+ repulsion contributions.

The question now is why this kind
of behavior is observed. As already
suggested by Grimme,31 there seems to be
two possible factors contributing to the enhanced stability of π–π
complexes: some kind of cooperative effect associated with electron
delocalization in these extended π systems, as also suggested
by Alonso et al.,40 and a softening of
the repulsive wall leading to smaller repulsion terms, allowing the
molecules to come closer and therefore increase dispersion. In order
to check these aspects of the interaction in the studied systems,
the interaction energies for all dimers have been obtained using an
intermolecular distance corresponding to the minima of the smallest
dimer of each kind.

It can be observed in Table S2 that
there is in fact a shortening of intermolecular distances at the minima
as the size of the system grows. This effect is observed for all kinds
of complexes, and it can be related with the larger interaction energies
that hold the molecules closer against the repulsive wall. However,
the extension of these changes in equilibrium distances is quite different
depending on the type of complex considered. A shortening of 0.18
Å is observed when passing from the benzene dimer to the pentacene
dimer, while in the corresponding σ–σ complexes,
it amounts to just 0.06 Å, and in σ–π complexes,
it is slightly larger (0.08 Å) but still significantly smaller
than in π–π dimers. The results suggest that as
the size of the aromatic system extends, there is a softening of the
repulsive wall because of electron delocalization, allowing the molecules
to come closer. On complexes containing aliphatic species, though,
there is almost no change on the characteristics of the repulsive
wall, so the minima are mostly at the same position. Then, it can
be deduced that the stability of the different dimers diverges as
the size of the system grows because the changes on distance observed
in π systems allow for a reinforcement of the attractive contributions
overwhelming the increase in repulsion. Thus, there is a larger energy
increase in π–π systems because the distance shortening
is more accused, followed by mixed dimers, while in aliphatic dimers,
the distance barely changes and therefore the stability is enhanced
to a less extent.

Table 2 lists the
energy changes on the interaction energy and its contributions when
the dimers are moved to their equilibrium distance from a position
corresponding to the equilibrium distance of the smallest dimers (see
the full set of values in Table S8). In
π–π systems, there is a clear shortening in the
intermolecular distance, responsible of a change of −1.3 kcal
mol–1 in the interaction energy of the pentacene
dimer. This increment is mainly due to an increase in dispersion but
also electrostatics, and it is counterbalanced by the increase in
repulsion. It is worth noting that the increase in electrostatics
is probably due to penetration effects because the distance shortening
facilitates charge overlap. In aliphatic dimers, there is no significant
shortening and therefore the changes in the contributions are tiny.
Mixed complexes show an intermediate behavior, with slightly larger
shortening reflected in moderate increases in dispersion and electrostatics.

Therefore, it seems clear
that a different behavior associated
with the intermolecular distance shortening takes place in π–π
complexes. However, it can be observed in Table 2 that the effect of this shortening, though
large in several of the contributions as repulsion or dispersion,
has a limited effect on the total stability of the complexes. For
complexes containing pentacene and perhydropentacene, the stability
gain due to distance shortening amounts to just −1.3 kcal mol–1 in π–π complexes, being much smaller
in mixed or aliphatic ones. However, when comparing the stability
of the different complexes, the pentacene dimer is more stable by
almost −2 kcal mol–1 compared to the σ–π
complex and more than −6 kcal mol–1 compared
to the σ–σ analogue. Thus, the shortening on intermolecular
distances is capable of explaining a large fraction of the energy
differences between π–π and σ–π
complexes (more than 50%), but only recovers a small fraction of the
stability differences when comparing π–π and σ–σ
complexes.

Figure 6 summarizes
this behavior. It can be observed that the values obtained at the
minima or employing a constant intermolecular distance only differ
significantly in the case of π–π dimers. The steepest
energy gain in π–π complexes can be clearly seen
while aliphatic ones increase their stability much slowly. As indicated
above, the figure suggests two different origins for this fact. On
the one hand, the softer repulsive wall in π–π
systems allows an extra increment in stability associated with the
shortening on the intermolecular distance. On the other hand, there
seems to be an effect associated to the extension of the π systems
leading to larger interaction energies even at a constant distance.

interaction energies for the most stable structure of
the dimers as the system grows. Solid lines correspond to values obtained
at the equilibrium distance of each dimer; dotted lines show values
obtained fixing the distance at the value obtained for the smallest
dimer of each kind.

It is worth noting that
when the intermolecular distance is kept
fixed, the rate at which the interaction grows is similar in both
π–π and σ–π complexes, and the
differences only appear when the intermolecular distances are allowed
to change. Thus, the different behavior observed between π–π
and σ–π complexes can be largely ascribed to the
shortening of interplane distances observed in π–π
systems. However, the differences remain in the case of σ–σ
complexes even keeping fixed intermolecular distances, so there must
be another effect associated with the nature of the interacting systems.
There seems that the properties of the π molecules change as
the system grows leading to larger interaction energies.

In
fact, comparing how the different contributions to the interaction
energy increase at a constant intermolecular distance (Figure 7), it can be observed that
the electrostatic contribution favors mixed complexes over π–π
ones (compare with Figures 4 and S4), leading to a stability gain of more than 2 kcal
mol–1 in pentacene complexes. Also, repulsion is
larger in mixed complexes, while dispersion slightly favors π–π
ones. At a constant intermolecular distance, the energy differences
between π–π and σ–π remain tiny
as the size grows. The picture is different in aliphatic complexes;
the electrostatic term still favors σ–σ complexes
but the stability difference comes from dispersion, which changes
more quickly in π–π complexes. Therefore, aromatic
complexes are favored over aliphatic ones because dispersion grows
more quickly while repulsion does it more slowly. The stability gain
over aliphatic systems comes from both a decrease on repulsion and
from an increase in dispersion due to changes in the electronic distribution.
Also, the decrease in repulsion allows for the molecules to become
closer, favoring even more stabilizing contributions, especially dispersion.

Figure 7 Changes
on the contributions to the interaction energy keeping
the intermolecular distance fixed at the value obtained for the smallest
dimers of each kind.

For all the abovementioned reasons, the main factors affecting
the stability gain of π–π complexes relative to
aliphatic ones are changes on molecular properties allowing a stronger
interaction. As an example, the behavior of the isotropic polarizability
was monitored for aromatic and aliphatic molecules. It can be observed
that as the size of the system grows, the polarizability increases
much faster in aromatic molecules than in aliphatic ones. Considering
that polarizabilities are related with induction but also with dispersion
contribution (recall that in the simple London expression, dispersion
coefficients are proportional to polarizabilities: C6,ab ≈ IPaIPb/(IPa + IPb) αaαb; IPs are ionization potentials
and α represents polarizabilities), these changes in polarizability
could mimic the trends observed in interaction energies. Thus, while
cyclohexane polarizability amounts to 70 a.u., for benzene it is slightly
smaller (66 a.u.). Already in anthracene, the polarizability (177
a.u.) is larger than in its perhydrogenated counterpart (158 a.u.),
and the difference is even larger in pentacenes (334 a.u. vs 249 a.u.
in the hydrogenated derivative).

In summary, the changes observed
fixing intermolecular distances
are related to the intrinsic properties of the interacting systems,
and indicate that π–π stacking interactions have
some special characteristics when compared to similar aliphatic stacking
interactions. This particular behavior, probably related to electron
delocalization, is only evident in extended systems, in agreement
with previous findings31,40 The interaction energies grow
faster in complexes containing aromatic molecules as a consequence
of a larger increase in dispersion. Simultaneously, repulsion increases
in π–π complexes at a slower rate than in σ–π
or σ–σ complexes, so the combined result of these
two effects clearly favors π–π dimers. This accounts
for around 80% of the energy differences observed relative to σ–σ
dimers and 40% relative to σ–π ones. Besides, because
of the shortening of intermolecular distances, π–π
complexes display an extra stabilization mostly related to increasing
electrostatics and dispersion contributions, though the same happens
to repulsion so the final effect is not large (but still responsible
of more than 50% of the energy differences between π–π
and σ–π dimers).

Conclusions
A
computational study has been carried out to determine the characteristics
of the interaction in stacked systems. In order to unveil their inherent
differences and similarities, systems were studied comprising aromatic–aromatic,
aliphatic–aliphatic, and aromatic–aliphatic stacked
dimers. The systems considered include linear acenes up to hexacene
and nonlinear ones as pyrene, perylene, and coronene; as aliphatic
molecules, their perhydrogenated derivatives were employed. Stacked
homodimers of each of these molecules, as well as heterodimers formed
by an aromatic species and its perhydrogenated derivative were studied
employing a set of different relative orientations.

For π–π
complexes, the most favorable relative
orientation is a displaced stacked geometry resembling the arrangement
of the different layers in graphite. The same arrangement is the most
favorable one in σ–π dimers, while in the case
of aliphatic σ–σ dimers, the most favorable geometry
is the fully stacked one, with one molecule just on top of the other
one. Several exceptions have been observed in nonlinear systems, favoring
in some cases another structure, though this usually happens by a
narrow energy margin.

The results show that the interaction
energies increase as the
size of the system grows following a linear relationship with the
number of carbon atoms in the system. However, the interaction energy
increases much faster in π–π complexes than in
σ–σ ones. For σ–π complexes,
an intermediate behavior is observed, though the energies lie closer
to the π–π values. The main reason behind these
changes on the interaction energies as the size of the system grows
is dispersion, which is larger in π–π complexes
and also increases at a higher rate. However, the results indicate
that repulsion also increases in a similar way as dispersion, so the
effects of both contributions to the interaction energy cancel each
other to a large extent and the net effect is not especially large,
though favorable.

The main factor favoring the stability of
aromatic dimers over
aliphatic ones as the size of the system increases is related to the
nature of the aromatic systems. Changes in molecular properties due
to larger electron delocalization as the aromatic system grows lead
to an increase in the dispersion contribution to the stability, absent
in aliphatic dimers. Besides, an extra stabilization is observed in
π–π dimers related to the softening of the repulsive
wall that allows shorter intermolecular distances. The combination
of these two effects makes π–π dimers to become
more and more stable relative to complexes containing aliphatic species
as the size of the system grows.

Computational Methods
In order to obtain interaction energy curves for each of the dimers,
the intermolecular distance between molecules is changed along a series
of values, while keeping the monomer geometries frozen at the values
obtained for the isolated molecules. Calculations are performed using
the dispersion-corrected TPSS-D3BJ method54,55 together with the def2-TZVPP basis set.56 Ehrlich et al. showed that this method gives a proper description
of the interaction in this kind of systems.38 Also, it has been shown recently that TPSS-D3BJ is capable of reproducing
the values obtained for the interaction energies in bowl-shaped dimers.51 At each intermolecular distance, the interaction
energy is computed at this level of calculation applying the counterpoise
correction avoid basis set superposition error.57,58 The resolution of the identity approach is used in these calculations
employing the def2-TZVPP auxiliary basis set.59 These calculations were performed with Turbomole 6.3.60 Once the potential curves for the dimers are
available, the positions of the minima are obtained by interpolation.

Interaction energies at the minima of the TPSS-D3BJ curves have
also been obtained with the MP2.X method proposed by Riley et al.61−63 In the MP2.X method, the energy is extrapolated to the complete
basis set limit at the MP2 level using the two-point extrapolation
procedure of Helgaker with the cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ basis sets.64,65 In order to save computation time, the polarization function with
highest angular momentum has been deleted in both basis sets, and
RI and RIJCOSX approaches were employed.66,67 1  and 2  

The effects of higher-order terms on
the correlation energy are
estimated by means of a properly scaled MP3 calculation employing
the 6-31G(0.25) basis set (scale factor C = 0.62).
The final interaction energy at the MP2.X level is the combination
of the MP2 energy extrapolated to basis limit plus the third-order
contribution scaled by 0.62.61 MP2.X calculations
have been carried out using the ORCA program.68 3  

The interaction energies have
also been obtained by applying SAPT
with intramonomer correlation effects described at the DFT level [
SAPT(DFT)]45,69−71 using Molpro
2015.72 These calculations have been performed
with the PBE0 functional and the cc-pVTZ basis set, employing as auxiliary
basis sets cc-pVTZ/JKFIT for Hartree–Fock and cc-pVTZ/MP2FIT
for the second-order dispersion terms, and with the nonlocal part
of the exact exchange in PBE0 being replaced by a local approach.69,73 The adiabatic local density approximation has been used to compute
the frequency-dependent response functions involved in the calculation
of dispersion. To obtain proper results with SAPT(DFT), the functional
must be asymptotically corrected, using a shift parameter obtained
as the sum of the ionization potential and the energy of the highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO).52,73 Ionization
potentials and HOMO levels of the systems studied have been obtained
at the PBE0/cc-pVTZ level (see values in Table S1).

The contributions obtained from SAPT are grouped
into four terms,
corresponding to repulsion, electrostatic, induction, and dispersion
contributions. It is considered that Erep = Eexch1; Eele = Epol1; Edisp = Edisp2 + Eexch-disp2; Eind = Eind2 + Eexch-ind2 + δHF. δHF is a term representing
contributions higher than second order and it is obtained from a SAPT
calculation employing Hartree–Fock wavefunctions: δHF = ΔEHF – (Eexch1 + Epol1 + Eind2 + Eexch-ind2), with ΔEHF being the counterpoise-corrected interaction energy at the
HF level. The value of the coupled Eexch-disp2 is estimated by applying a scaling factor to the uncoupled Eexch-disp2.

While most contributions to the interaction
energy already reach
values close to the basis set limit with a basis set of triple-zeta
quality, dispersion contribution converges very slowly with the basis
set size. Therefore, dispersion values are extrapolated to the basis
set limit assuming a cubic dependence as suggested by Helgaker employing
cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets.64,65 Thus, the final values
are a combination of the cc-pVTZ electrostatic, repulsion, and induction
contributions, plus the dispersion contribution extrapolated to basis
limit.51,52,74 This strategy
has been successfully followed by Heßelmann and Korona in their
study of the interaction in large complexes.52
