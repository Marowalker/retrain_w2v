A rapid, sensitive, and specific colorimetric biosensor
based on
the use of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) was designed for the detection
of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in clinical
samples. The biosensing platform was based on the measurement of P. aeruginosa proteolytic activity using a specific
protease substrate. At the N-terminus, this substrate was covalently
bound to MNPs and was linked to a gold sensor surface via cystine
at the C-terminus of the substrates. The golden sensor appears black
to naked eyes because of the coverage of the MNPs. However, upon proteolysis,
the cleaved peptide–MNP moieties will be attracted by an external
magnet, revealing the golden color of the sensor surface, which can
be observed by the naked eye. In vitro, the biosensor was able to
detect specifically and quantitatively the presence of P. aeruginosa with a detection limit of 102 cfu/mL in less than 1 min. The colorimetric biosensor was used to
test its ability to detect in situ P. aeruginosa in clinical isolates from patients. This biochip is anticipated
to be useful as a rapid point-of-care device for the diagnosis of P. aeruginosa-related infections.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa is an opportunistic
pathogen1 which is involved in various
nosocomial diseases such as respiratory tract infections,2,3 urinary tract infections,4 wound infections,5 and bacteremia.6P. aeruginosa was identified as the second infectious
pathogen isolated from patients with hospital-associated pneumonia
(HAP).7 Therefore, rapid and proper diagnosis
is essential to enable timely treatment in order to reduce the risk
of mortality. Accordingly, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and
the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) issued guidelines
for the management of HAP and emphasized on the importance of “quantitative
cultures” for specific HAP diagnosis without deleterious consequences.8

Conventional diagnostic methods are based
on culturing and require
at least 24 h to report the results, reducing the chance of appropriate
and successful treatment.3,8 Alternatively, rapid
quantitative detection methods based on real-time polymerase chain
reaction (PCR)9−11 and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays12 were developed to detect P. aeruginosa in HAP clinical specimens. In these methods, results were obtained
within a few hours with high specificity and sensitivity. However,
these methods are costly and laborious and require handling by highly
skilled personnel. Bacterial enzymes, such as proteases, are ideally
suited as biomarkers for quick and sensitive identification of micro-organisms
in clinical samples.13 Many of these enzymes
are released into the surrounding microenvironment and are accessible
for detection based on sensitive fluorogenic and/or colorimetric substrates.14−17 Recently, a specific peptide substrate was identified to detect
the activity of the P. aeruginosa specific
LasA protease, of which the expression appears to be mediated by the
Las and Rhl quorum sensing (QS) systems.13,18,19 In this study, this P. aeruginosa specific peptide substrate was coupled to magnetic nanoparticles
(MNPs) to be utilized in a rapid and specific colorimetric biosensor.

2 Results and Discussion
P. aeruginosa is considered the
second most prevalent nosocomial bacterium in hospital environments
and can contaminate medical equipment.1 Its infection is challenging due to its resistance to a large number
of antibiotics.20 Therefore, there is a
high-demand for the development of rapid and early detection method
in clinical samples to guide therapeutic treatment.

Kaman et
al.13 designed and evaluated
a fluorogenic substrate as a potential tool to detect the virulence
of P. aeruginosa. This P. aeruginosa specific protease substrate was utilized
in the development of the paper-based colorimetric assay. In brief,
hexanoic acid (Ahx) linkers were attached to both terminals of the
peptide sequence (Gly-Gly-Gly) to enhance the protease accessibility
to the peptide substrate near the sensor surface. Then, a cysteine
amino acid was linked to the C-terminal, allowing the gold–thiol
interaction and resulting in the formation of a self-assembled monolayer
(SAM) of P. aeruginosa peptide–MNPs
onto the gold sensor surface. The N-terminal of the peptide was attached
to the MNPs.

2.1 Testing the P. aeruginosa Protease Biosensor
Initially, the fabricated sensor was
examined to detect the proteolytic activity of P. aeruginosa protease by incubating 107 cfu/mL over the functionalized
gold sensor surface. Upon proteolysis, the peptide segment–MNP
moiety was released and collected by a circle shaped magnet placed
at the back of the sensor strip. This results in revealing the golden
color of the sensor surface, which is visible to the naked eye. Then,
this biosensing method was applied for quantitative detection of P. aeruginosa. Accordingly, different concentrations
of P. aeruginosa 4.5 × 107, 4.5 × 106, 4.5 × 105, 4.5
× 104, 4.5 × 103, 4.5 × 102, and 4.5 × 10 cfu/mL were added over the functionalized
gold sensor. Results in Figures 1 and 2 show the gradual increase
in the visible bare gold area with increasing bacteria concentration.
This is explained by the ability of the higher protease enzyme concentration
to dissociate the peptide–MNP moiety faster than the lower
concentrations. Moreover, to validate the colorimetric biosensor,
a negative blank [brain heart infusion (BHI) broth only] with no protease
was incubated with the sensor and showed no cleavage (Figure 2). Results confirmed the ability
of the fabricated biosensor to detect P. aeruginosa.

Figure 1 Colorimetric P. aeruginosa proteases
sensor probe tested with different concentrations of P. aeruginosa ranging from 4.5 × 107 to 4.5 × 10 cfu/mL.

Figure 2 Dose response of the sensor under the effect of various
concentrations
of P. aeruginosa.

The developed colorimetric biosensor exhibited
a limit of detection
of 102 cfu/mL within one min time. This detection limit
was determined by identifying the lowest protease concentration, capable
of cleaving the covalently attached peptide black MNP moiety, which
in turn revealed the sensors’ golden surface area. The negative
blank (BHI broth only) showed no change in colors, as the sensor demonstrated
no disruption of the SAM layer (Figure 1).

This colorimetric detection method provided
better detection limit
in a shorter time than the previously reported fluorescent dye including
the lipid vesicle method, which was reported by Thet et al.21 Although, their method managed to correctly
discriminate 40 clinical isolates of two pathogens, P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), their method was used
only for qualitative measurements. Another method developed to provide
quantitative detection of P. aeruginosa was reported by Tang et al.22 This method
is based on the use of magnetic enrichment and magnetic separation
methodology and managed to detect as low as 10 cfu/mL. Dong et al.1 managed to develop a ten times more potent polymerase
spiral reaction method with a lower detection limit of 2.3 pg/μL1 within 60 min. Tang et al.23 shortened the procedure time for DNA extraction to detection
and retained a lower detection limit of 10 cfu/mL based on magnetic
enrichment and nested PCR. All above mentioned methods are complex
and require the use of centralized labs, instrumentation, and trained
personnel. In addition, the PCR techniques are not suitable for bed-side
routine testing, unlike the colorimetric assay described in this study
which is approved to be cheap, simple, rapid, and sensitive. Furthermore,
it does not require expensive equipment and trained personnel. It
is to be mentioned that sensor stability in addition to the amount
of a substrate–MNP composite was optimized in our previous
work to achieve optimal monolayer performance.16,17,24−26

2.2 Specificity of the Sensor
The biosensor
specificity was examined in the presence of two other pathogenic microbes: Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes), and S. aureus. Figure 3 shows the results of the P. aeruginosa sensors with L. monocytogenes and S. aureus, respectively. The
sensor showed no disruption of the SAM layer and no significant change
in the sensor surface golden color upon incubation with L. monocytogenes and S. aureus, showing sufficient specificity to detect P. aeruginosa.

application and (B) S. aureus before
and after application.

2.3 Detection of P. aeruginosa in Clinical Isolates
The clinical applicability of the
developed biosensors was tested using 20 P. aeruginosa clinical isolates (among which sputum, ear, and wound). These samples
were previously analyzed by conventional culture and PCR methods at
King Faisal Specialist Hospital microbiology laboratory. These samples
were incubated with the fabricated biosensor and all showed positive
results, with a clear cleavage of the peptide–MNPs moiety,
with a consequent appearance of the sensor golden surface color (Figure 4). Notably, the differences
in cleavage intensity between tested samples were attributed to the
difference in the number of colonies of P. aeruginosa. A negative control proved no cleavage of the peptide–MNPs
moiety without any disruption of the SAM layer. The experiments were
conducted in triplicate.

3 Conclusions
This study demonstrated
the ability of the designed colorimetric
biosensor to detect P. aeruginosa protease
in clinical samples. The assay was simple, rapid, sensitive, and specific
and does not require any labeling or amplification steps. Furthermore,
it does not require sample pretreatment or preconcentration and so
can be applicable for onsite use by clinicians. This low-cost colorimetric
biosensor was based on the use of specific substrate–MNPs,
which were covalently attached to the gold sensor surface. This biosensing
configuration is amenable for a qualitative and semi quantitative
detection of P. aeruginosa proteases.
The limit of detection was as low as 102 cfu/mL within
one min. In conclusion, this biosensor presented a valuable onsite
diagnostic tool to improve the control of potential risk infections
caused by P. aeruginosa.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials and Reagents
Carboxyl-terminated
beads (50 nm diameter), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS),
1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethyl-carbodiimide (EDC), and the plastic
pH indicator strip were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Dorset, UK).
Self-adhesive magnet sheets were purchased from Polarity Magnets Company
(Wickford, Essex, UK). The P. aeruginosa peptide substrate NH2-Ahx-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ahx-Cys was synthesized by
Pepmic Co. Ltd (Suzhou, China). BHI broth and agar were purchased
from SDA, Oxoid Ltd (Basingstoke, UK). Sterile filters (0.22 μm)
were obtained from Millipore (Watford, UK). The wash/storage buffer
(10 mM Tris base, 150 mM sodium chloride, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum
albumin, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 0.1% sodium azide,
pH 7.5) and the coupling buffer (10 mM potassium phosphate, 0.15 M
sodium chloride, pH 5.5) were prepared from chemicals of analytical
grade.

4.2 Bacteria Culture and Protease Preparation
P. aeruginosa (ATCC 15692), S. aureus (ATCC 25923), and L. monocytogenes (ATCC 19115) were individually cultured on BHI agar plates for 24
h at 37 °C. Subsequently, a single colony from each bacterium
was grown in 5 mL BHI medium and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h
to provide the primary bacterial culture (PBC) stock. Then, each bacterial
concentration PBC was pelted by centrifugation at 3000g for 10 min, and the culture supernatant was filtered to obtain P. aeruginosa crude protease solution to be used
later in sensitivity and specificity studies. Also, the bacterial
count was analyzed via a spread-plate technique by plating 10-fold
serial dilutions from each bacterial concentration on BHI plates and
then incubating at 37 °C overnight.

4.3 Clinical Isolates and Protease Preparation
Twenty clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa were collected from King Faisal Specialist Hospital bacterial biobank
in Riyadh kingdom at Saudi Arabia. The bibliographic data of the sources
were not reviled to us. The samples were as follows: 12 from sputum,
3 from ear, 1 from wound, and 4 from different (unregistered) sites.
The specimens were examined in King Faisal Specialist Hospital microbiology
lab for complete identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing.
Clinical isolates were then stored at −70 °C. After which,
samples were thawed and recultured, and a single colony from each
clinical isolate was grown in 5 mL BHI medium and incubated at 37
°C for 16 h to provide the PBC stock which was then centrifuged
to pellet bacteria. Consequently, culture supernatant containing secreted
proteases was added dropwise over the constructed biosensor to examine
its applicability.

4.4 Preparation of the Substrate–MNP Composite
The carboxylated MNP suspension (1 mL) was mixed with the peptide
substrate (1.0 mg/mL), EDC (0.57 mg/mL) and NHS (12 μg/mL).
The mixture was shaken gently on a rotary shaker at room temperature
for 24 h. The substrate–MNP composites were isolated using
a magnet separator and washed three times, using a washing buffer
to remove uncoupled components (Scheme 1A). Finally, the conjugate was dispersed in a storage
buffer and stored at 4 °C until further use.24,27

4.5 Biosensing Platform Preparation and Functionalization
Self-adhesive sheets were purchased from Whatman (London, U.K.)
and coated with gold using a sputtering machine in the clean room
at KAUST-KSA. The gold-coated sheet was cut into rectangular pieces
(4 mm × 2 mm) and stacked over the plastic strip at a specified
distance 3 mm. This plastic strip was used as a physical support for
the whole biofunctionalization process as well as the P. aeruginosa protease detection and quantification
sensor (Scheme 1B).

The biosensing gold surface was functionalized with a layer of
the black color substrate–MNPs composite. At the beginning,
the substrate–MNPs composite suspension was mounted over the
gold sensor surface and allowed to stand at room temperature for 30
min for dryness (Scheme 1C). Subsequently, an external magnet (12.5 × 12.5 × 5 mm)
with a field strength of 3360 and 573 G at 1 and 10 mm distance, respectively,
was passed over the functionalized strip to remove any unattached
substrate–MNPs conjugates. At this stage, the sensor surface
golden color is masked and turned black (Scheme 1C). After that, a round paper magnet was
fixed on the strip back, 2–3 mm distance below the sensor platform.

4.6 Biosensing of P. aeruginosa Proteases
Culture medium supernatant solution containing P. aeruginosa crude proteases was added dropwise
on the functionalized black color sensor surface. During the enzymatic
cleavage reaction, the paper magnet attracted the cleaved peptide
segment–MNPs, prompting a visual observation of the sensor
golden color for a qualitative evaluation of the tested samples (Scheme 1D). Moreover, a quantitative
evaluation was performed by using different counts of P. aeruginosa 4.5 × 107, 4.5 ×
106, 4.5 × 105, 4.5 × 104, 4.5 × 103, 4.5 × 102, and 4.5 ×
10 cfu/mL.

4.7 Quantitative Measurements
The images
of the sensors were taken and saved as JPEG format and processed using
the ImageJ software, which was developed by the National Institute
of Health28 to calculate the quantitative
data. The concentration was calculated by dividing the cleaved area
(yellow color) to the total black sensor area. The quantitation was
tested using different bacteria concentrations. Experiments were conducted
in triplicate.
