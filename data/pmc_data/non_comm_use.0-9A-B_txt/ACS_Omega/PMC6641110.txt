Controlling the molecular
assembling and nanomorphology of organic
semiconductors is crucial to obtain high-performance electronic devices.
In this work, we have first reported novel superlong salicylideneaniline
nanobelts (mHBA) using the magnetic nanoparticle-assisted self-assembly
process. Our results show that magnetic nanoparticles will obviously
influence the self-assembly behavior, nanomorphology, and crystal
structure of molecular HBA. Moreover, the intensity of fluorescence

in temperature over a wide temperature range of 8 to 295 K. To elucidate
the origin of tautomer forms, the ground and excited states of mHBA
were experimentally and theoretically studied. Our results suggest
that superlong HBA nanobelts provide a promising intelligent fluorescent
thermometer and an organic field-effect transistor.

1 Introduction
Controlling
the crystal structure and nanomorphology of organic
molecules, especially molecular orientation, growth pattern, and packing,
is crucial to obtain high-performance organic electronic devices.
Recently, the self-assembly of oriented organic materials assisted
by magnetic field as a straightforward and clean method has been receiving
greater attention. For example, magnetic field has even been demonstrated
to be able to control the crystal structure and separate polymorphs
of crystals postsynthetically.1−4 However, self-assembly of organic molecules by an
external magnetic field has the disadvantage of inconvenient operation
and high magnetic field strength. To overcome these drawbacks, developing
novel and effective magnetic induction strategies to control the morphology
and alignment of organic molecules will be much significant. As we
all know, magnetic nanoparticles dispersed in a solvent will show
a self-assembly phenomenon owing to its own magnetic field effect.
Thus, magnetic nanoparticles are a very promising candidate for controlling
organic molecular self-assembly because of their low magnetic field
intensity on the micro/nanoscale. Moreover, studying the self-assembly
behavior, crystal structure, and nanomorphology of organic molecules
assisted by magnetic nanoparticles is a novel and challenging research
field. However, an organic molecular self-assembly assisted by magnetic
nanoparticles has never been reported.

On the contrary, the
organic molecules for self-assembly by a magnetic
field generally have a π-conjugated molecular structure with
strong diamagnetic anisotropy, which makes the molecular magnetic
energy strongly dependent on the orientation between the molecular
axis and the external magnetic field. Therefore, it is very important
to find suitable functional organic molecules for assembly by a magnetic
field. Salicylideneaniline (SA) and its derivatives have been known
to exhibit thermochromism and photochromism in the solid state and
have been very promising candidates as sensors over the past decade.5−7 Recently, the fluorescence method for determining the temperature
has attracted much attention because of its accurate, sensitive, and
observable properties; especially, a fluorescent sensor is very useful
under a cryogenic condition because it is difficult to detect low
temperatures.8−14 However, the fluorescence intensity is also affected by the chemical
structure, excitation wavelength, and sample morphology, which influence
the accuracy and restricts the utility of the fluorescence sensor.
Thus, dual-emitting intensity systems based on two emissive compounds
have been developed to enhance the performance of the fluorescent
sensor. Dual-emitting temperature systems overcome many of the obstacles
encountered with absolute intensity-based fluorescence sensors, including
optical occlusion, concentration variation, or nonspecificity, by
providing internally referenced signals. Thus, dual-emitting systems
have attracted wide attention to date. Particularly, SA can exist
in several tautomer forms in the process of thermochromism and photochromism.
Thermochromism properties show reversible color change at different
temperatures, which is due to the tautomeric thermal equilibrium between
the enol form and the cis-keto form. Most SAs are more stable in the
cis-keto form than in the enol form at room temperature in solid state,
whereas the population of the cis-keto form decreases and that of
the enol form increases with the decrease in temperature. The population
of the isomers follows the Boltzmann distribution law.15−21 In addition, UV irradiation of the enol and cis-keto forms produces
the metastable trans-keto form, thanks to the cis-keto and trans-keto
photoisomerization of the C–N bond.22 Recently, some studies have reported that the temperature-induced
transform of the tautomeric equilibrium are not solely owing to the
thermochromic color change of the organic crystals. Thermochromism
can also be explained by the temperature-induced change in fluorescence.
Although SA and its derivatives as important optical organic compounds
have been used in a wide range of applications, as temperature-responsive
fluorescent sensors, they have not been reported to date. Especially,
4-(2-hydroxybenzylideneamino)-benzoic acid (HBA), an SA derivative
containing a carboxyl group at the para-position on the aniline moiety,
is a very promising candidate as a temperature-responsive fluorescent
material.

In this work, we first report novel superlong SA,
HBA, semiconductor
nanobelts using the magnetic nanoparticle-induced self-assembly process.
In addition, we studied the morphology and crystal structure of HBA
before and after the addition of the magnetic nanoparticle. Moreover,
the intensity of fluorescence mHBA nanobelts exhibits decreasing and
increasing patterns, with the increase in temperature over a wide
temperature range of 8 to 295 K. Furthermore, we have shed light on
the origin of the three tautomer forms, enol, cis-keto, and trans-keto,
in the process of thermochromism by experimental and quantum chemical
studies. Thus, our results suggest that mHBA nanobelts can be used
as a sensitive dual-emission fluorescent thermometer and organic field-effect
transistors for large-area or gradient temperature measurements over
a wide temperature range.

2 Results and Discussion
In the present study, we report novel superlong HBA nanobelts,
called mHBA nanobelts, synthesized using molecular HBA self-assembly
assisted by magnetite–carbon nanoparticles (MCNPs) in solvent.
The first step involves the syntheses of both molecular HBA and MCNPs
according to previously reported methods (see the section S1). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier
transform infrared spectra (FTIR) data show that HBA has been successfully
synthesized, as shown in Figures S1 and S2. A typical X-ray diffraction (XRD) result of the MCNP is shown in Figure S3, which can be well indexed to iron
oxides (JCPDS file 88-0315, magnetite). The morphology of the MCNP
products was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Figure 2a,b. It can be seen that the
particle is sphere-like in shape with an average size of ∼200
nm. The structure of single magnetite–carbon colloidal nanoparticles
has been characterized by TEM (Figure 2b, inset photograph). MCNPs clearly have a shell structure
and are composed of dozens of primary iron oxide nanocrystals. Moreover,
the magnetic properties of MCNP are investigated by measuring the
magnetization as a function of the applied field at 300 K (Figure 2c). MCNP exhibits superparamagnetic behavior, as indicated
by the presence of open hysteresis loops in the M–H curves. Such high-saturation magnetization
of MCNP is advantageous for magnetic guiding applications because
it allows them to respond rapidly to an external magnetic field. In
the second step, MCNPs and molecular HBA are mixed in a ethanol/acetone
(1:1) solution for 36 h at 45 °C. In this process, MCNPs will
induce self-assembly of HBA molecules to form superlong nanobelts,
as indicated in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Schematic representation of the self-assembly of mHBA nanobelts.

To further investigate the morphology
of HBA and mHBA, Figure 2d–f show SEM images of HBA and mHBA.
The SEM image
of mHBA shows that a belt-like structure of mHBA are typically 10
μm in diameter and more than ∼800 μm long, whereas
HBA are ∼150 μm in length and 10 μm in diameter,
as shown in Figure 2d,e. We have also signed the scale of the image with a red line.
The results show that the magnetic field can affect the nucleation
and crystal growth rate of the organic molecular in a solution. An
increase in the crystal growth rate in the presence of the magnetic
field might be explained by the relaxation of this strain by the formation
of dislocations, which in turn enhances the growth rate.2,23 The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data of HBA and mHBA
are measured in the solid state, as shown in Figure 3a. HBA exhibits two emission peaks, a clearly
strong peak at 543 K and an abnormally wide weak peak at ∼573
K. mHBA also shows two emission peaks, a strong peak at 546 K and
a wide weak peak at ∼573 K. The strong peak is attributed to
the phase change of nanobelts and the absorption peak corresponds
to the melting of nanobelts. From Figure 3a, we can calculate the values for the heat
of fusion for each of the polymorphs as 444.7 and 502.0 J/g for HBA
and mHBA, respectively. The results show that mHBA will be the more
stable at these temperatures and therefore should be expected to have
a greater specific enthalpy of fusion. Moreover, to investigate the
change in the crystal structure, HBA and mHBA are also characterized
by an XRD measurement, as shown in Figure 3b. It can be clearly seen that the pattern
exhibits a strong peak located in the low-angle region (approximately
4.2 and 8.5°), which indicates the formation of lamellar structures.
The XRD data show that the peak of mHBA (approximately 8.5 and 12.8°)
will split into two peaks and the intensity of the peak of mHBA will
become weaker compared with that of HBA. The above results demonstrate
that magnetic nanoparticles will obviously influence the self-assembly
behavior and crystal structure of mHBA.

To evaluate the optical property of mHBA, UV–visible
and
fluorescence spectra of mHBA are measured in the solid state. Figure S4 shows the absorption and emission spectra
of HBA at room temperature. mHBA shows the absorption peak at 430
nm and the emission peak at 550 nm at room temperature. The optical
properties of mHBA can be further assessed by using UV radiation,
called “mHBA-L.” mHBA-L is also characterized by fluorescence
spectra measurement at room temperature, as shown in Figure 4b. mHBA-L exhibits two emission
peaks at around 551 nm, a weak peak at ∼585 nm, and an abnormally
wide weak band at ∼610–630 nm at room temperature compared
with mHBA, which exhibits the peaks at 295 K. Upon cooling from 295
to 8 K, a new broad emission peak at 521 nm and a clearly strong peak
at 585 nm are observed. The absorption peaks at 551 and 585 nm contribute
to the absorption of cis-keto. The absorption peak at 661 nm corresponds
to the emission of mHBA trans-keto because of the population of the
metastable trans-keto form after photoisomerization. Furthermore,
to better understand the optical properties of the mHBA molecule,
we have carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations to
elucidate the absorption and emission properties of the mHBA molecule.
The theoretical calculations of its energy levels are performed using
the DFT method with a B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) basis set. The theoretical
absorption and fluorescence spectra for the three isomers of mHBA
(enol, cis-keto, and trans-keto) are depicted in Figure 4c,d, and the most relevant
data are collected in Table 2. The theoretical spectrum of cis-keto mHBA shows the absorption
peak at 437 nm and the emission peak at 551 nm at room temperature,
which is in agreement with our experimental peaks shown in Figure S4 and those previously reported.24,25

To elucidate the origin
of the tautomer forms of mHBA, we have
carried out theoretical studies using quantum chemical calculations
on both the ground state (S0) and the excited state (S1) of mHBA. Figure 4a shows the photochemical process and energy-level schemes
of the photo-induced processes for molecular HBA. The detailed results
of the quantum chemical calculation have been shown in section S2. The optimized geometry of enol mHBA
in the ground state calculated at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of
theory predicts an enol structure, in which the dihedral angle between
the two aromatic rings is approximately 15° (Table S1). Figure S5 shows the
molecular packing diagram of enol HBA according to the crystal data
from Table S1.

The theoretical spectrum
of enol mHBA shows an absorption peak
at 354 nm at room temperature, which is in agreement with previously
reported data.26−28 Furthermore, structural optimizations in the S1 state of cis-keto mHBA are conducted at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)
level starting from the planar S0 optimized geometries
and the characterization of the theory, as shown in Table 1. Furthermore,
the vertical excitation energy of cis-keto mHBA calculations estimated
the lowest transition energy at 2.25 eV (λcalc =
551 nm) with a small oscillator strength (f = 0.188).
The calculated transition energy is consistent with the experimentally
observed value of cis-keto mHBA (2.25 eV, λmax =
551 nm). In addition to the trans-keto S1 structure, we
also find another local minimum structure in the S1 state,
which has a trans-keto conformation (Figure 4d and Table S2). The fluorescence wavelength for the trans-keto structure is calculated
to be 662 nm (1.87 eV, f = 0.061), which well agrees
with the experimentally observed longer wavelength fluorescence at
632 nm. This result is consistent with the experimentally observed
small red shift for the shorter wavelength fluorescence at 632 nm,
which indicates the structural relaxation to the trans-keto mHBA conformation
in the S1 state. The results of the fluorescence spectroscopies
and theoretical calculations in the excited state demonstrate that
mHBA can have two isomer structures in the S1 state, namely,
cis-keto and trans-keto. Charge distribution calculations in the optimized
structures of mHBA also give insights into the nature of their excited
state, as shown in Table S2.29,30

To evaluate the influence of the
temperature-induced fluorescence
changes in mHBA and mHBA-L, fluorescence spectra of the samples are
measured in the solid state at 8–295 K. Figure 5a–d show the fluorescence emission
spectra of mHBA and mHBA-L measured from 8 to 40 and 40 to 295 K,
respectively. As previously mentioned, a fluorescence band around
551 nm is observed for mHBA at room temperature, as shown in Figure 5b. Interestingly,
upon cooling, a new peak around 520 nm is observed at approximately
165 K. Upon further cooling from 165 to 8 K, the new broad emission
peak more clearly appears around 520 nm. Similar fluorescence spectral
changes were reported for Schiff base in the solid state, and they
were explained in terms of the conformational change of the cis-keto
form in the excited state. The structure at the longer wavelength
λmax = 551 nm is a more stable and relaxed conformation
cis-keto*
form. The structure at the shorter wavelength λmax = 520 nm is preferred at a lower temperature, which is mainly attribute
to hot cis-keto* form. These observations indicate that the structural
conversion from hot cis-keto* to cis-keto* form in the S1 state of mHBA is suppressed in the solid state at a low temperature,
as shown in Figure S1a.31 It has been found that it is a tautomeric equilibrium between
the hot cis-keto* and cis-keto* forms in mHBA. The hot cis-keto* form
is usually less stable than the cis-keto* form at a low temperature.
When the temperature is lowered, the cis-keto* form decreases in population.
Therefore, thermochromism could be explained by the absorption change
because of the transform of the tautomeric equilibrium at different
temperatures. However, mHBA-L exhibits three emission peaks at around
521, 551, and 585 nm at 8 K. Although the peak position around 551
nm without any appreciable change is observed up to 295 K, the fluorescence
intensity of mHBA-L around 551 nm gradually decreases. The two peaks
at 521 and 585 nm finally disappear from 8 to 295 K. Concomitant with
this change, the fluorescence intensity of the two peaks dramatically
decreases (Figure 5c,d).

Figure 5 Fluorescence emission spectra of mHBA (a,b) and mHBA-L (c,d) at
different temperatures from 8 to 295 K.

To quantitatively determine the influence of the temperature-induced
fluorescence changes in mHBA, Figure S6 shows the fluorescence emission spectra as a function of the temperature
for mHBA and mHBA-L. Figure S6a,b show
the fluorescence intensity of mHBA and mHBA-L measured from 8 to 295
K, respectively. The results of mHBA exhibit that the fluorescence
intensity change is strongly dependent on the temperature (Figure S6a). With decreasing temperature, the
fluorescence intensity increases and shows the maximum value around
40 K. Then, the intensity decreases as the temperature is increased
from 40 to 8 K. The temperature dependence of the emissions similar
to that of mHBA is also observed for mHBA-L, which demonstrates that
these properties are general to the structurally constrained mHBA
(Figure S6b). The total quantum yield of
the fluorescence is 0.11 for mHBA at 295 K. Moreover, mHBA shows temperature-dependent
luminescence with a very high quantum yield over a wide temperature
range from 8 to 295 K, as shown in Table S3. The total quantum yields of the fluorescence are 0.11 and 0.87
at 8 and 295 K, respectively.

Furthermore, Figure 6a,b show the integrated fluorescence
intensity as a function of the
temperature for mHBA. Curves in Figure 6a,b represent the temperature dependence of the integrated
emission intensity from 8 to 295 K. The fluorescence intensity is
weak at room temperature. However, the intensity increases when the
temperature is decreased from 295 to 40 K, although the intensity
decreases as the temperature is increased from 40 to 8 K, in agreement
with the change in intensity as previously mentioned. When the temperature
decreases to 40 K, the normalized integrated emission intensity is
found to be approximately 98%. This phenomenon is quite consistent
with that reported in previous studies about inorganic materials.35 Thus, the behavior can be explained as owing
to the interaction of radiative and nonradiative recombination. The
fluorescence intensity is dominated by radiative recombination at
40 K, at which the radiative lifetime is because of the thermal balance
between the occupation of the excited state of hot cis-keto* and cis-keto*
forms. As temperature increases above 40 K, the single population
increases in turn by nonradiative recombination and the fluorescence
intensity decreases. The population exchange described by Figure 4a between the two
fluorescent excited states of hot cis-keto* and cis-keto* forms establishes
a thermal equilibrium, following the Boltzmann distribution law.

To reveal the mechanism for the
phenomenon about temperature dependence
of fluorescence intensity, some groups have developed the activation
energy model to adequately describe negative thermal quenching.32−35 According to this model, the temperature-dependent fluorescence
intensity can be expressed as eq 1. 1  where I(T) and I(0) are the intensities at temperature T and 0 K, respectively; Aj and Cj are parameters; kB is the Boltzmann
constant; and E1j is
the energy difference between the given excited state Ej and the lowest excited state E1 for processes that increase the fluorescence
intensity with increasing temperature (see section S5 for details). We have fitted the curve with the expression
of eq 1. The curves in Figure 6a,b represent the
results of the best fit according to eq 1 on the whole temperature range. The activation energies
as important parameters greatly influence the reliability of fitting
results. The fitting produces three activation energies of 2 (E1), 17.3 (E2), and
104 (E3) meV for HBA (Figure 6a and Table S4). The fitting produces three activation energies of 1.5
(E1), 22 (E2), and 142 (E3) meV for mHBA-L (Figure 6b and Table S4). Moreover, the percentage of each exciton
state is calculated based on eq S2 and
the fitting parameters Aj and Cj, as shown in Table S4, Figure S8a,b. As the temperature increases from 8 to 40 K, although the percentage
of E1 excitons decreases slightly, the
percentage of E2 excitons increases more
significantly, which leads to a remarkable increase in the integrated
intensity with temperature, as shown in Figure S8a,b. In the temperature range from 40 to 298 K, although
the percentage of E2 excitons increases
somewhat with the increasing temperature, the percentage of E3 excitons increases significantly. The E3 excitons are almost nonradiative; therefore,
the integrated intensity decreases. In addition, the percentage of E4 is too small; thus, the integrated intensity
versus temperature is not influenced by E4. Obviously, because the impact of each of the three exciton states
of mHBA and mHBA-L varies with temperature, the steady-state-integrated
intensity of mHBA varies with increasing temperature as follows: first,
the integrated intensity increases dramatically and finally decreases
significantly.

To avoid the disturbance of mHBA optical signals
from the surroundings,
we have plotted the ratio of the two emission intensities of mHBA
as self-calibrated fluorescence materials as a function of temperature.
The curve measured for mHBA was plotted as the ratio of the integrated
excitonic emission (Icis) to the integrated
total emission (Itot) versus temperature,
as shown in Figure 6c. The curves in Figure 6c represent the results of the best fit according to eq 1 on the whole temperature
range. The internal sensitivity in the temperature range from 8 to
295 K is calculated according to the equation. These data show a maximum
internal sensitivity of ∼0.021% K–1 at ∼147
K, as shown in Figure S9. Moreover, to
facilitate the use of a thermometer, the temperature-dependent fluorescent
spectra are transformed to the Commission International de L’Eclairage
(CIE) coordinates, as shown in Figure 6d. The results exhibit temperature-dependent green-to-yellow
fluorescence in the CIE (x, y) chromaticity
diagram from 8 to 295 K. The color transform can be easily observed
by the naked eye and captured by CCD cameras. This intense thermosensitive
emission over a wide range conquers the limitation that high temperatures
induce a low signal/noise ratio. Our results suggest that mHBA is
an excellent candidate as a reliable and self-referenced fluorescent
temperature sensor.

3 Conclusions
We have
synthesized novel superlong HBA nanobelts (mHBA) using
a magnetic nanoparticle-assisted self-assembly process, which shows
temperature-dependent fluorescence over a wide temperature range from
8 to 295 K. Our results show that magnetic nanoparticles will obviously
influence the self-assembly behavior, morphology, and crystal structure
of mHBA. Moreover, we have shed light on the origin of the three tautomer
forms in the process of thermochromism and photochromism by the experimental
and quantum chemical studies. We first found that the intensity of
fluorescence mHBA decreases as the temperature increases from 40 to
295 K, although the intensity of fluorescence decreases as the temperature
is increased from 40 to 8 K. Furthermore, we have adequately explained
this mechanism of temperature-dependent fluorescence intensity by
the multilevel activation energy model. Particularly, mHBA nanobelts
exhibit temperature-dependent dual fluorescence ratio (Icis/Itot) from 8 to 295 K
for self-referenced ratiometric optical thermometry. Thus, our results
suggest that mHBA nanobelts provide a promising intelligent fluorescent
thermometer as cryogenic thermometry for a diverse optical thermometric
and organic field-effect transistor.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Preparation of HBA Nanobelts (mHBA)
HBA and MCNPs were synthesized using a previously reported procedure
(see Supporting Information for detailed
experimental procedures). For a typical preparation, 50 mg of HBA
was dissolved in 50 mL ethanol/acetone (1:1) solution first, followed
by the addition of 5 mg of magnetite nanoparticle into the solution
and mixing for 36 h at 45 °C. The products separate into two
parts of mHBA and magnetite nanoparticles, as shown in Figure S10. Finally, the products were dried
at room temperature in a vacuum oven. A solid powder was obtained,
which was denoted as mHBA.

4.2 Theoretical Methods about
HBA Nanobelts (mHBA)
All DFT and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT)
calculations were carried
out using Gaussian 09. For the ground state of each derivative, full
geometry optimizations were carried out at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)
level of theory. Further, we used the TD-DFT) technique to assess
the properties (absorption and fluorescence) of the excited states
at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level.

4.3 Characterizations
NMR spectra were
recorded on a Bruker AV300 NMR spectrometer (resonance frequency of
300 MHz for 1 h) operated in the Fourier transform mode. CDCl3 was used as the solvent. FTIR spectra were measured on a
NICOLET FT-IR spectrometer, using pressed KBr tablets. UV–vis
spectra were recorded on a Solid Spec-3700 spectrophotometer at room
temperature. Fluorescence measurements were recorded on the Fluorolog-3-Tau
(Jobin Yvon, France) fluorescence spectrometer. The excitation wavelength
for the fluorescence spectra was 290 nm, which was produced by a xenon
lamp equipped with a grating monochromator. Low temperatures were
achieved by the CCS-355 (Janis, America) low-temperature equipment.
The field emission scanning electron microscopy images were taken
on a FEI Sirion-200 scanning electron microscope. TEM images were
obtained by a Hitachi model H-800 instrument with a tungsten filament,
using an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The XRD patterns were recorded
using a Philips X’Pert Pro Super diffractometer with Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). The magnetic data were acquired
using a magnetic property measurement system (MPMS) 5XL Quantum design
SQUID magnetometer at room temperature. DSC measurements were taken
on a Mettler-toledo DSC823e instrument (temperature range: 300–650
K; aluminum crucible with pierced lid; sample mass: 3.5 mg; air atmosphere;
and heating/cooling rate: 5/5 K min–1).
