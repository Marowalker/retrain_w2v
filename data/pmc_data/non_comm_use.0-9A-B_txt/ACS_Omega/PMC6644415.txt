A number of simple
oligopeptides have been recently developed as
minimalistic catalysts for mimicking the activity and selectivity
of natural proteases. Although the arrangement of amino acid residues
in natural enzymes provides a strategy for designing artificial enzymes,
creating catalysts with efficient binding and catalytic activity is
still challenging. In this study, we used the polyproline scaffold
and designed a series of 13-residue peptides with a catalytic dyad
or triad incorporated to serve as artificial enzymes. Their catalytic
efficiency on ester hydrolysis was evaluated by ultraviolet–visible
spectroscopy using the p-nitrophenyl acetate assay,
and their secondary structures were also characterized by circular
dichroism spectroscopy. The results indicate that a well-formed polyproline
II structure may result in a much higher catalytic efficiency. This
is the first report to show that a functional dyad or triad engineered
into a polyproline helix framework can enhance the catalytic activity
on ester hydrolysis. Our study has also revealed the necessity of
maintaining an ordered structure and a well-organized catalytic site
for effective biocatalysts.

==== Body
Introduction
Natural enzymes, exhibiting
powerful efficiency and remarkable
selectivity because of their unique folded structures, are usually
involved in biochemical reactions. They play a major part in maintaining
the functions in organisms. For instance, proteases are capable of
accelerating the digestion of proteins into shorter fragments by hydrolyzing
the peptide bonds. However, restricted to their length and complexity,
most enzymes are difficult to acquire and vulnerable to environmental
conditions, such as pH and temperature. Thus, artificial enzymes have
received much attention in recent years because of their great stability
and easy accessibility. Baker et al. and Korendovych et al. explored
the efficient catalysts with rigid protein scaffolds by computational
design.1,2 Ulijn et al. conducted phage display as
a discovery technique for selecting active sequences.3 To demonstrate more details on the importance of three-dimensional
structures, many artificial enzymes using various scaffolds, such
as α-helical-coiled coils and barrels,4−6 β3-peptide bundles,7 short helices,8 and β-hairpins,9,10 were
reported. Moreover, nanomaterials11,12 and self-assembled
structures including membranes,13 amyloid
fibers,14−17 and hydrogels18 were implemented for
mimicking similar protein structures; yet, the activity of these supramolecular
frameworks is still limited compared to natural enzymes.

In
natural enzymes, their active site is frequently composed of
several residues, taking responsibility for specific binding and chemical
catalysis. For example, chymotrypsin, a serine protease, possesses
a hydrophobic pocket for binding to aromatic substrates and a catalytic
site composed of His57, Asp102, and Ser195 residues.19 It is generally accepted that more than two amino acid
residues that operate together at the active site of enzymes are regarded
as a catalytic dyad or triad. Mechanically, nucleophilic residues
(cysteine and serine) play a role of attacking the substrate; histidine
acts as a general base to deprotonate the nucleophile; and acidic
residues (aspartic acid and glutamine acid) function to polarize and
align the base (Figure 1A).20,21 Additionally, it is well-documented that
the guanidyl group in the arginine residue22 and the backbone NH group1,23,24 can aid in stabilizing the transition state of the substrate. These
functional residues were initially applied to the primary sequence
design25 and subsequently considered in
the coassembly system.15,16,22

Cartoon representation of a PPII helix with His incorporated into
the i position.

Inspired by the previous reports, here we chose polyproline
peptides
as the scaffold and introduced a catalytic dyad or triad into the
peptides. It was found that proline-rich sequences in proteins often
form a polyproline II (PPII) structure, a left-handed helix with all
trans peptide bonds, and three residues in each turn. On account of
their structural stability and rigidity, oligoproline peptides were
widely used as rulers and scaffolds for various studies.26,27 Hence, we designed and synthesized a series of 13-residue polyproline
peptides containing a histidine residue at the i position
and other residues with a functional side chain, such as Asp, Ser,
and Cys, at the i + 3 or i –
3 position, as minimalistic biocatalysts (Figure 1B). According to the structure of a PPII
helix, these positions would be located on the same side, and we predicted
that the imidazole side chain of His could place an appropriate orientation
and form strong interactions with the functional groups at position i – 3 or i + 3 to form a dyad or
triad active site. Additionally, (2S,4R)-hydroxyproline (Hyp) and (2S,4R)-methoxyproline (Mop), 4-substituted proline derivatives, were found
to have a high propensity to form PPII conformation because of the
stereoelectronic effects.28,29 Therefore, they were
also used to replace the regular proline residues for understanding
the correlation between PPII structure and enzyme activity. The results
showed that the interactions between different functional groups significantly
contributed to the catalytic ability and that a well-formed PPII structure
could lead to a higher catalytic efficiency.

Results and Discussion
To explore the activity of polyproline-based catalysts on ester
hydrolysis, we chose (Pro)11 as the control peptide (free P11) and designed a series of peptides in which the specific
position was substituted with His and the residues frequently found
in the active sites of natural enzymes. For a single His-incorporated
peptide (H6), the His residue was placed in the middle
(position 6) of the peptide because the conformation of His might
be fixed by the proline-rich sequence. In the multiple substitution
peptides, His residues were incorporated into position 6, whereas
nucleophilic (Cys, Ser, and His), neutral (Trp), and acidic (Asp)
residues were placed at positions 3 and 9 to mimic the triad or dyad
in natural enzymes. These peptides were designated as H3H6, W3H6, S3H6, S3H6D9, and C3H6D9. In addition, the peptides with Pro replaced by Hyp
(Hyp-H3H6 and Hyp-C3H6D9) or Mop (Mop-H3H6) were applied to investigate the relationship between
PPII-forming propensity and catalytic efficiency. A Gly–Tyr
dipeptide was attached to the C-terminus of each peptide for concentration
determination. Furthermore, all peptides except for free P11 have capped ends because a previous study found that the removal
of the capping groups would reduce the catalytic activity.14 The sequences of designed peptides are shown
in Table 1.

After synthesis of the peptides, circular dichroism
(CD) spectroscopy
was utilized to characterize their secondary structures. As shown
in Figure 2, all peptides
exhibit a similar far-UV spectrum with a positive band between 220
and 230 nm and a negative peak near 205 nm, indicating the presence
of PPII conformation. We used the maximal molar ellipticity at the
positive band to evaluate their PPII-forming propensity and content.
As shown in Figure 2 and Table 2, the
replacement of proline to nonproline residues causes the decrease
in the PPII structure. Compared to free P11, all peptides
with Pro replaced by other residues display a much weaker positive
band, and the multiple substitutions impose an even greater effect
on PPII conformation than does the single substitution. Although the
peptides with double- and triple-substituted nonproline residues show
a much weaker characteristic CD signal of the PPII structure, W3H6 displays a stronger positive band around 230 nm due to
the electronic absorption of aromatic residues.30,31 Therefore, the PPII propensity of W3H6 could not be
evaluated solely by its ellipticity at the positive band. As expected, Hyp-H3H6, Hyp-C3H6D9, and Mop-H3H6 form a relatively intense PPII structure, and their molar ellipticity
in the positive band is close to or even higher than that of free P11 (Figure 2B and Table 2), which can be attributed to that Hyp and Mop prefer a Cγ-exo pucker and a trans peptide bond to enhance PPII-forming propensity.28,29

To evaluate the catalytic
efficiency of our designed peptides and
compare the results with the previous hydrolase designs, we chose p-nitrophenyl acetate (p-NPA) as a simple
chromogenic substrate to monitor the catalytic reaction. The catalytic
reaction is as follows:

The initial hydrolytic rate (V0) was
determined by monitoring the production of 4-nitrophenol at 405 nm
and pH 7.4 with ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy.
As shown in Figure 3A,B, the dependence of the initial hydrolytic rate on the substrate
concentration for each peptide is consistent with the Michaelis–Menten
model, and the kinetic parameters can be obtained and calculated by
fitting the curves to the model. The determined parameters are listed
in Table 3. The reaction
in the presence of free histidine residues was also monitored and
used as a control. Figure S3 in the Supporting Information indicates that the rate of hydrolysis of p-NPA in the presence of free P11 was extremely
low and close to that without any peptides or amino acids present
in solution, suggesting that the polyproline backbone was unable to
catalyze the reaction. This is likely attributed to the fact that free P11 does not contain nucleophiles to accelerate the reaction,
and the proline residues lack NH groups on the backbone to stabilize
the oxyanion intermediate of ester hydrolysis as suggested by previous
studies.1,23,24

To prevent the electrostatic
repulsions and extra charges from
affecting the catalytic efficiency, we introduced end caps by acetylating
the N-terminus and amidating the C-terminus on the following peptides: H6, W3H6, H3H6, S3H6, S3H6D9, and C3H6D9. Of the designed peptides,
His, Trp, Ser, Asp, or Cys was incorporated in the multiple substitution
peptides for the purpose of forming catalytic dyads or triads. As
shown in Table 3, the
catalytic efficiency of the H6 peptide (kcat/KM is 0.39 M–1 s–1) is lower than that of free His (kcat/KM is 0.45 M–1 s–1), indicating
that the single His incorporation in a polyproline peptide could not
induce an effective electron transfer to catalyze the reaction. By
contrast, the polyproline peptides with double substitutions (H3H6, S3H6, and W3H6) are 1.5-fold
more active in comparison with H6, suggesting that the
residues (His, Ser, and Trp) at position 3 of H3H6, S3H6, and W3H6 could interact with His at position
6 to facilitate the electron transfer and enhance the catalytic properties.
Therefore, it could be inferred that all peptides with double substitutions
may form a catalytic dyad in their active site. As detailed in Table 3, W3H6 is more efficient than H3H6 and S3H6 and
has a kcat/KM value of 0.60 M–1 s–1. It could
be explained by an increased nucleophilicity of His because of the
histidine–aromatic interaction provided by Trp at position
3, which was also observed in barnase, a natural hydrolase.32 To validate our assumption that the PPII structure
can facilitate a proper orientation between the side chains of His
and Trp and generate strong interactions to enhance the catalytic
activity, we prepared a dipeptide Trp–His (WH)
and measured its catalytic efficiency. As shown in Figure S4 of the Supporting Information, its catalytic efficiency
(kcat/KM is
0.52 M–1 s–1) is lower than that
of W3H6, providing a piece of evidence that the PPII
framework does play a positive role to increase its catalytic activity.
Surprisingly, the catalytic activity of the peptides with triple substitutions
slightly decreased compared with those with double substitutions.
Their catalytic activity of the hydrolyzing p-NPA
is around 0.45 M–1 s–1. It seems
that introducing more residues into the PPII structure could not always
benefit their catalytic abilities. As shown in Table 2, the peptides with triple substitutions
(S3H6D9 and C3H6D9) dramatically reduce
the propensity of forming a PPII structure, which may lead to an increased
distance between the i and i + 3/i – 3 positions. Thus, it could be assumed that the
catalytic triad may not be successfully formed in S3H6D9 and C3H6D9, and Asp cannot play a role as orienting
the His residue and neutralizing the intermediates.

To demonstrate
more structure–activity relationships, we
replaced the proline residues of H3H6 and C3H6D9 with Hyp and used Mop to substitute for the proline of H3H6 as well to form a more robust PPII structure. Interestingly, as
shown in Figure 3B,
we found that both Hyp-H3H6 and Hyp-C3H6D9 remarkably accelerated the hydrolysis of p-NPA.
An approximately threefold increase in catalytic efficiency was observed
for Hyp-H3H6 compared with free His residue. Both of
the Hyp-H3H6 (kcat/KM is 1.23 M–1 s–1) and Hyp-C3H6D9 (kcat/KM is 0.99 M–1 s–1) exhibited a twofold higher efficiency than that of their corresponding
peptides H3H6 (kcat/KM is 0.56 M–1 s–1) and C3H6D9 (kcat/KM is 0.43 M–1 s–1), respectively. As shown in Table 3, the peptides with Hyp-rich sequences show a relatively
stronger binding affinity (lower KM) for
the substrate than do their Pro-rich counterparts, leading to a much
higher catalytic efficiency. It is likely that Hyp residues provide
extra interactions and result in a stronger binding to the substrates.
As reported in a few natural active sites, an oxyanion hole could
stabilize the transition state of the substrate.1,23,24 Therefore, we believe that the OH group
on the Hyp side chain could potentially serve as a hydrogen bond donor
to stabilize the reaction intermediate and increase the reaction rate.
This argument may also be supported by the observation that Mop-H3H6 exhibits a slightly higher activity (kcat/KM is 0.62) than H3H6 but a much lower activity than Hyp-H3H6 (Figure 3C). Because the OMe
group on the Mop side chain cannot be a hydrogen bond donor, Mop cannot
form similar hydrogen bonding interactions as Hyp does during the
reaction, leading to a lower catalytic efficiency. In addition, the
fact that Hyp-H3H6, Hyp-C3H6D9, and Mop-H3H6 have a higher catalytic efficiency than their corresponding
peptides (H3H6 and C3H6D9) demonstrates
the important role of a PPII structure. As aforementioned, the peptides
containing Hyp or Mop residues favor the formation of a stable PPII
structure, which may bring about a closer distance between the i and i + 3/i –
3 positions. As a result, it could be speculated that the PPII helix-forming
propensity of our designed peptides also has a great impact on their
catalytic activity. Although the efficiency of our designed peptides
is not comparable to that of natural enzymes in catalyzing such an
ester hydrolysis reaction, most of our designed polyproline-based
peptides still exhibited a greater catalytic activity than some reported
peptide-based nanostructures whose kcat/KM ranges from 0.09 to 0.62 M–1 s–1 at pH 7.5.12,15,16 Most notably, even as a short peptide, the activity
of Hyp-H3H6 is better or comparable to the previously
reported metal-based esterases (kcat/KM is 0.33–1.38 M–1 s–1 at pH 7.5).5

Because
the protonated and deprotonated state of an active site
would affect its catalytic activity, we investigated the hydrolysis
reaction under different pH conditions for the selected peptides: W3H6, H3H6, S3H6D9, and Hyp-H3H6. As illustrated in Figure 3D, while the efficiency of these peptides remained low below
pH 8.0, a noticeable increase could be observed as the pH values rose
beyond 8.0. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of each selected peptide at pH 10.0
is in the range of 23–30 M–1 s–1, which is 30-fold greater than that at pH 7.4 (Table S3 in the Supporting Information). Using eq 1, a pair of kinetic pKa could be determined for each selected peptide (Table 4). As the typical
pKa of a His imidazole ring is about 6,
it is likely that the obtained pKa values
around 6.5 represented deprotonation of a His side chain. Besides,
we would suggest that the higher pKa reflected
deprotonation of the Tyr side chain because its pKa is approximately 10.3 in the free form. We further used 1H NMR spectroscopy to measure the pKa of a His side chain in S3H6D9. A series of high-resolution
one-dimensional (1D) 1H NMR spectra for S3H6D9 were acquired at pH values ranging from 4 to 8 (Figures 4A and S5 in the Supporting Information), whereas a titration
curve was obtained by plotting the chemical shifts of His C2H versus pH (Figure 4B). By fitting the titration curve into the Henderson–Hasselbalch
equation (eq 2), a pKa value of 6.64 and a Hill coefficient of 1.6
could be determined for S3H6D9. The pKa value measured by NMR is in good agreement with the
pKa value derived by the kinetic hydrolysis
assay, reflecting that the deprotonation of the His imidazole group
could significantly increase the catalytic efficiency.

Furthermore, to have more insights into the
structure of designed
peptides, we conducted Hartree–Fock (HF) calculations on the
conformation of oligopeptides. As it was found that Ac-(Pro)5-OMe is the simplest peptide model to form a stable PPII structure,33 we used the seven-residue oligopeptide models,
Ac-(Pro)2Ser(Pro)2HisPro-OMe, Ac-Cys(Pro)2His(Pro)2Asp-OMe, and Ac-(Pro)7-OMe,
to simplify the computational studies, in which Ac-(Pro)2Ser(Pro)2HisPro-OMe was used to mimic S3H6, whereas Ac-Cys(Pro)2His(Pro)2Asp-OMe was
utilized as a model to mimic C3H6D9. In the energy-minimized
structure, the dihedral angles of Ac-(Pro)2Ser(Pro)2HisPro-OMe and Ac-Cys(Pro)2His(Pro)2Asp-OMe are similar to those of Ac-(Pro)7-OMe and an idealized
PPII helix, indicating that this peptide could form a PPII-like helix
(Table S4 in the Supporting Information). For an ideal PPII helix, every third residue is about 9 Å
apart, suggesting that the distance between the two side chains at
positions i and i + 3 should be
less than 9 Å to form possible interactions. As shown in Figure
S6 of the Supporting Information, the distance
between the side chains of Ser and His in the energy-minimized structure
of Ac-(Pro)2Ser(Pro)2HisPro-OMe is 5.4 Å,
which is significantly shorter than 9 Å, suggesting that the
functional groups of Ser and His might interact and form a reaction
dyad to catalyze ester hydrolysis. This finding may in part explain
why S3H6 exhibits a better activity than H6. For the optimized structure of Ac-Cys(Pro)2His(Pro)2Asp-OMe (Figure 5), the distance between Cys and His is 2.90 Å, whereas the distance
between His and Asp is up to 6.7 Å. In comparison, the distances
within the catalytic triad of chymotrypsin, a serine protease, are
shorter than 3 Å,19 which facilitates
the proton transfer between them. It could be inferred that the functional
groups in the triple substitution peptide, C3H6D9, might
not form a catalytic triad because the long distance between His and
Asp could hinder them from forming an appropriate orientation between
the functional groups. Therefore, the observation in the computational
structure may rationalize why the triple substitution peptides exhibited
a less catalytic efficiency than did the double substitution peptides.

Conclusions
In
the current work, a series of polyproline peptides were designed
and prepared to form PPII helices and serve as a scaffold to catalyze
ester hydrolysis. We found that introducing a pair of residues containing
His into the PPII structure could successfully imitate a catalytic
dyad and improve the catalytic efficiency. However, introducing more
than two nonproline residues could dramatically perturb the PPII structure
and failed to form a catalytic triad in the polyproline-based scaffold.
Surprisingly, the replacement of Pro to Hyp in the peptide not only
favors forming a stable PPII helix but also provides additional interactions
to accelerate the hydrolysis of ester. In addition, the deprotonation
of histidine side chains could enhance the catalytic activity of peptides.
Our results provide compelling lines of evidence that the secondary
structure of the peptide-based enzymes could have substantial impacts
on their catalytic activity for ester hydrolysis and demonstrate new
insights into the structure–activity relationship of polyproline-based
catalysts. This work also reveals valuable information for the design
of potentially useful peptide-based enzymes. With a view to develop
remarkable artificial enzymes, the studies of organizing suitable
secondary and tertiary structures to improve their catalytic activity
are currently on the way in our laboratory.

Materials and Methods
General
Chemical reagents and [(9-fluorenylmethyl)oxy]carbonyl
(Fmoc) amino acids were purchased from Advanced ChemTech, Alfa Aesar,
ECHO, JT Baker, and Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification.
Fmoc-(2S,4R)-Mop was synthesized
by the method previously described.29 Preloaded
Tyr resin was prepared by attaching Fmoc-Tyr-OH to 2-chlorotrityl
resin using the procedure previously described.31 The loading capacity of Fmoc-Tyr resin was determined according
to the previously reported method (Applied Biosystems Technical Note
123485, Rev. 2, http://www3.appliedbiosystems.com/cms/groups/psm_marketing/documents/generaldocuments/cms_040640.pdf). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)
spectra were obtained using an Autoflex III SmartBeam LRF200-CID spectrometer
(Bruker Daltonics).

Peptide Synthesis and Purification
All peptides were
synthesized on a 0.05 mmol scale by standard solid-phase methods and
Fmoc chemistry protocols. HBTU-mediated coupling reactions were carried
out on a Discover SPS microwave peptide synthesizer (CEM Corp.). Preloaded
2-chlorotrityl resin was used to produce a free C-terminus, whereas
the use of the Rink amide resin generated an amidated C-terminus upon
cleavage. Cleavage of the peptides from the resin and side-chain deprotection
was performed using a solution of 95% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/2.5%
triisopropylsilane (TIS)/2.5% H2O (v/v) or 94% TFA/1% TIS/2.5%
H2O/2.5% 1,2-ethanedithiol (v/v) to treat the peptide-resin
product for 3 h at ambient temperature. The filtrate was then precipitated
and washed with ice-cold methyl t-butyl ether and
purified by reverse-phase HPLC with a semipreparative C18 column.
H2O/acetonitrile gradients with 0.1% (w/v) TFA were used
as the eluting solvent system to purify the peptides. The purified
products were identified by MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry (Table S1
and Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). All peptides were more than 90% pure according to the HPLC analysis
as shown in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information.

Preparation of Peptide Stock Solutions
Purified and
lyophilized peptides were dissolved in 25 mM buffer solution [MES
(pH 6.0–6.5), HEPES (pH 7.0), Tris (pH 7.4–9.0), and
CAPS (pH 10.0)] to make a 0.5 mM peptide stock solution. The concentration
of peptides was determined by the UV absorbance at 280 nm in 6 M guanidine
hydrochloride at pH 6.5, using an extinction coefficient of 1420 M–1 cm–1 for Tyr and 5500 M–1 cm–1 for Trp.

CD Spectroscopy
CD spectra were recorded on an Aviv
model 410 CD spectrometer with a 1 mm path-length-quartz cuvette.
The measurements were performed in pH 7.4 and 25 mM Tris buffer with
a peptide concentration of 100 μM. The far-UV CD spectra were
taken from 190 to 260 nm with an averaging time of 10.0 s and a wavelength
step of 1 nm at 25 °C.

Kinetic Assays
The catalytic activities
of the peptides
were determined using p-NPA as the substrate. The
kinetic measurements were performed on a JASCO V-630 spectrophotometer
associated with an STR-773 water thermostatic cell holder and stirrer
by monitoring the absorbance of the hydrolysis product (p-nitrophenol) at 348 nm or 405 nm at 25 °C. A volume of 100
μL of the freshly prepared peptide stock solution was added
to 1900 – x μL of buffer solution. After
having recorded the initial absorbance (blank), a volume of x μL of 20 mM p-NPA stock in acetonitrile
was subsequently added to obtain a final p-NPA concentration
of 100–1600 μM (the final acetonitrile content was less
than 5% in all reaction mixtures). The reaction mixture was stirred
for 60 s before collecting the data, and the absorbance was recorded
every 10 s for 150–1200 s (as shown in Table S2 of the Supporting Information). Initial rates were determined
from linear fits of the plots of absorbance versus time, and the values
were from averaging duplicate measurements. The extinction coefficients
of the hydrolysis product at different pH values were experimentally
determined by measuring the absorbance of p-nitrophenol
in the specified buffers and by taking the average of at least three
repeats. The reported kinetic parameters (kcat and KM) were derived by fitting the
data to the Michaelis–Menten equation, and the pH-dependent
curves were fit to the following modified Henderson–Hasselbalch
equation 1  

Determination of pKa by NMR
A series of S3H6D9 (1.2 mM) peptide samples were prepared
in 90% H2O/10% D2O-containing sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-propanesulfonate
in solution as the chemical shift reference. Their pH values in the
range of 4–8 were adjusted by adding NaOD or DCl directly into
the samples. High-resolution 1D 1H NMR spectra were acquired
at 25 °C using a Varian VNMRS-700 NMR spectrometer (Varian, Inc.)
at National Tsing Hua University Instrumentation Center. The spectra
were analyzed using Bruker Topspin (v.2.1) software, and the pKa values were determined by fitting a plot of
the chemical shift (δ) of His C2H versus pH into
the modified Henderson–Hasselbalch equation 2  where δ is the observed chemical shift,
δd is the chemical shift for the fully deprotonated
species, δp is the chemical shift for the fully protonated
species, and n is the Hill coefficient, which is
1 for a residue that follows ideal Henderson–Hasselbalch behaviors.

Structure Modeling
Geometry optimization for the model
peptide in the aqueous phase was carried out using the HF/6-31+g(d)
and CPCM-SCRF solvation method, conducted by the Gaussian 09 software.34 The initial structure was generated with idealized
torsion angles for the PPII backbones based on the reported structural
data.35
