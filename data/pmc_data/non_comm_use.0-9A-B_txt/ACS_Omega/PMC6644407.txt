We present a mechanistic explanation
of the BiI3 film
formation process and an analysis of the critical factors in preparing
high-quality solution-processed BiI3 films. We find that
complexation with Lewis bases, relative humidity, and temperature
are important factors during solvent vapor annealing (SVA) of films.
During SVA, water vapor and higher temperatures limit the formation
of the BiI3–dimethylformamide coordination complex.
SVA with an optimized water content and temperature produces films
with 300–500 nm grains. Films that formed solvent coordination
compounds at lower temperatures showed preferential crystal orientation
after solvent removal, and we elucidate its implications for carrier
transport. Addition of dimethyl sulfoxide to highly concentrated tetrahydrofuran–BiI3 inks prevents film cracking after spin-coating. We have measured
a quasi-Fermi level splitting of 1.1 eV and a diffusion length of
70 nm from films processed with optimal temperature and humidity.
The best device produced by optimized SVA has a power conversion efficiency
of 0.5%, Isc of ∼4 mA/cm2, and VOC of ∼400 mV. The low
photocurrent and voltage we attribute to the low diffusion length
and the unfavorable band alignment between the absorber and the adjacent
transport layers. The deep understanding of the relationship between
morphology/crystal structure and optoelectronic properties gained
from this work paves the way for future optimization of BiI3-based solar cells.

Introduction
Photovoltaic (PV) materials
such as copper zinc tin sulfoselenide
(CZTS),1−3 copper indium gallium sulfoselenide (CIGS),4−6 and, more recently, hybrid perovskites (HPs)7−9 are all solution-processable.
Solution-processed materials are exciting because they can be spray-coated,
blade-coated, or slot die-coated onto large substrates, often at low
temperatures,10 and thus may reduce the
upfront capital expenditure (CAPEX) to begin manufacturing.11 The CAPEX of roll-to-roll processing may be
as low as 0.06$/WaCap versus 0.68 to 1.01$/WaCap for CdTe and polysilicon processes ($/WaCap is $ per
annual production capacity in watts). However, materials such as CZTS
are not yet commercializable as device efficiencies are still less
than 15%, mainly because of low minority carrier diffusion lengths12 and low open-circuit voltages. However, CIGS
cells are commercial and have demonstrated module efficiencies of
16.5% for vacuum-deposited absorbers.13 Solution-processed CIGS is also being developed with laboratory-scale
efficiencies of 14.7%.6 The process still
requires a high-temperature step, and indium (used in CIGS) is considered
by some to add financial risk because of indium price volatility or
constraints on the manufacturing growth rate.14 Solution-processed HP efficiencies have increased rapidly and are
over 20% with the added benefit of requiring no high-temperature steps.15 As promising as these material are, they possess
several shortcomings. All high-efficiency HP materials contain lead,
which has environmental health risk.16 HP
materials also have limited lifespans owing to low thermodynamic stability
of the compound,17 degradation in the presence
of light and moisture,18 or light-induced
phase segregation.17 However, these materials
have remarkable properties and defect tolerance. The origin of this
defect tolerance is believed to come from a partial oxidation of the
Pb2+ cation, withholding its 6s2 electrons.19 These 6s2 electrons give rise to
a valence band maximum consisting of antibonding orbitals. In addition,
relativistic spin–orbit effects increase the width of the conduction
band considerably. As a result, dangling bonds from vacancy formation
appear as resonances within the bands, rather than as trap states
in the band gap.20 Bi3+ likewise
possesses this beneficial electronic structure, and it is expected
to possess a similar defect tolerance.20 BiI3 is composed of layers of edge-sharing BiI6 octahedra held together in part by van der Waals interactions.21 Lehner et al. have found that BiI3 has a large static dielectric constant with principal components
of the static dielectric tensor of εxx∞ = 18.9 and εzz∞ = 15.0, which may indicate effective screening of charged point
defects, thus improving transport.22 BiI3 has also shown lifetimes of over 7 ns.19 Materials with lifetimes of at least 1 ns (such as CZTS,
InP, and CIGS) have achieved device efficiencies of greater than 10%.19 Furthermore, materials such as BiI3 are well-investigated materials for room-temperature gamma-ray detectors23 owing to the high interaction cross section.
One of the biggest advantages of Bi3+ over Pb2+ is that it is less toxic. For instance, bismuth is already in use
as a component of lead-free solders. Compared to lead, mercury, and
arsenic, bismuth is the least toxic because of its low water solubility.24 While the World Health Organization (WHO) has
set a standard of 10 ppb for lead in drinking water,25 in contrast, no limits have been imposed for bismuth. Finally,
BiI3 has a 1.8 eV band gap and high absorption coefficient.21 Using the absorption coefficient data presented
by Brandt et al.,21 a 500 nm thick film
would be sufficient to absorb 95% of incident above-band gap photons.
A 1.8 eV-band gap BiI3 top cell would be well-matched with
a 1.12 eV Si bottom cell, which would give a maximum theoretical efficiency
of 45.3% in a four-terminal tandem configuration.26

Processing variables such as substrate temperature
during physical
vapor deposition or choice of solvent for solution processing21 greatly impact the morphology of the BiI3 film. Bridgman growth23 and vacuum-based
methods21 are well-developed techniques
for making BiI3 films. Solution-processing routes are less
well-developed. BiI3 has been solution-deposited from dimethylformamide
(DMF),21,27 tetrahydrofuran (THF),27 and dimethyl sulfoxide(DMSO).28 In fact, bismuth trihalides are known to form coordination compounds
with all of these solvents.28,29 These solvents are
similar in that they possess Lewis base sites, which result in the
solvent and BiI3 forming Lewis acid-base adducts. Hamdeh
et al. have applied DMF solvent vapor annealing (SVA) on a spin-coated
BiI3 film from THF solution to grow large grains, and by
this, they have achieved the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE)
to date for a BiI3-based solar cell of 1.0%.27 In SVA, films are heated in the presence of
solvent vapor using solvents that have affinity for BiI3. The presence of solvent vapor increases the mobility of molecular
species in the film and allows the film to reorganize and achieve
larger grains. DMF SVA has been also used previously in the hybrid
perovskites to grow grains of 1 μm in diameter.30,31 However, SVA is sensitive to the environment, which causes severe
reproducibility issues, and the key parameters, which have an impact
on the morphology, are neither known nor understood. Further, state-of-the-art
BiI3 solar cells with a PCE of around 1% suffer from significant
current and voltage losses. The materials chemistry reasons for these
deficiencies are not known to date.

Here, we address both issues.
We present an investigation of important
variables affecting SVA of BiI3 films, such as temperature
and water concentration. We used DMF as the SVA solvent as it forms
a mildly stable BiI3–DMF complex,28 which plays a role in growing good morphologies. We show
that tuning of water vapor concentration and temperature is crucial
to grow large-grained, void-free solution-processed BiI3 films and that the presence of ambient oxygen is less crucial. We
present a mechanism for the action of both water and temperature.
Through this understanding, we present an optimized SVA process for
growing continuous BiI3 films on TiO2 substrates.
For the first time, we apply absolute intensity photoluminescence
(AIPL) measurements on BiI3 films to assess the maximum
possible open-circuit voltage and lateral dc photoconductivity measurements
to assess the carrier transport. These measurements give us access
to the two key parameters for solar cell operation, the quasi-Fermi
level splitting (QFLS) and the average electron–hole diffusion
length. By correlating different SVA processes with these material
property measurements and PV device performance, we reveal the limiting
factors for the low device performance.

Results and Discussion
Effect
of Water, Temperature, and Solvent on Morphology
Pre-SVA
films are dense but small-grained (Figure 1a). SVA grows the grains (Figure 1b,c), but the morphologies
are not always the same. We noticed that films prepared in the fume
hood with SVA at 100 °C on different days have very different
morphologies. These films were prepared under the exact same conditions,
with the only difference being the humidities on these days. Indeed,
it is known that relative humidity (RH) can have a significant influence
on SVA.36 We see disconnected disk-shaped
grains (Figure 1b),
whereas films prepared at a different day showed large, uniform, and
dense grains (Figure 1c). To better understand this, we treated BiI3 films with
SVA at different temperatures and RHs.

Figure 1 Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of BiI3 films
grown on FTO/TiO2 substrates (a) after spin-coating and
before SVA; post DMF SVA on days with (b) lower RH and (c) higher
RH.

We prepared films treated with
SVA at 0, 35, and 70% RH at 80,
100, and 120 °C both in a fume hood but also inside a glovebox
to investigate the effect of ambient atmosphere. The relevant parameter
behind RH is the activity of water, which is proportional to the vapor
phase mole fraction. The vapor phase mole fraction is related to the
water concentration, assuming that all water introduced during the
start of SVA goes into the vapor phase. Water concentrations for a
RH/T combination are given in Table S1.
Multiplying this number by the SVA inner Petri dish volume gives the
total mass of water needed for SVA. It is this mass of water that
was mixed with DMF to create the water–DMF SVA solvent mixtures.
We observe that the SVA solvent is completely evaporated throughout
the SVA process. Some minor solvent and water loss is expected as
the SVA Petri dishes are not sealed. SVA is performed inside a smaller
Petri dish enclosed in a larger Petri dish to maintain the temperature,
reduce airflow effects, and limit material loss. It is important to
note that films prepared in ambient air have additional water exposure
from ambient RH. On the days we prepared our films in air, RH was
42% at 20 °C, which corresponds to an additional water content
of 7.2 × 10–6 g/cm3, which is between
1 and 7% of the total water concentration for the 35 and 70% RH conditions
at 80–120 °C and will hence be neglected in the following.

Films prepared from concentrated inks exhibited cracking after
spin-coating (Figure S2a). Note that the
BiI3 concentration in this study is twice that in previous
work.27 This cracking comes from tensile
stresses in the film as the THF rapidly evaporates.37,38 We developed a modified ink to prohibit cracking. Addition of 1–2
vol % DMSO to the THF inks prevented cracking and resulted in smooth
films (Figure S2b). The colors of the pure
THF and THF + DMSO films are different. The pure THF films are black
after spin-coating owing to the rapid THF evaporation leaving a pure
BiI3 phase behind. The THF + DMSO films are dark red after
spin-coating. This red color indicates the presence of a BiI3–DMSO complex in the film.28 Within
20 min of exposure to ambient air, these films gradually turn black,
indicating that the BiI3–DMSO complex is not stable
at room temperature and thus decomposes to leave behind the pure BiI3 phase. This slow decomposition process accompanied by the
evaporation of DMSO helps in obtaining uniform BiI3 film
nucleation and growth, which is similar to the behavior observed in
hybrid perovskites.7 We also tested DMF
as an additive to the BiI3–THF inks, but this resulted
in films that were not dense (Figure S3).

SEM images of films after SVA treatment in a fume hood with
different
RHs and temperatures are presented in Figure 2. Each of the panels in Figure 2 represents one film, prepared
at a specific SVA condition. For some SVA conditions, the films turned
orange after some time during solvent vapor exposure in the second
step of SVA. This is indicated by the colored swatch in the lower
right-hand corner of each panel. A brighter orange swatch means the
film turned orange early on during the second step of SVA. The darker
the swatch, the longer the film took to turn orange. All black swatches
mean the films never changed color. The times listed in the orange
swatches are the durations the films were orange. The films prepared
at 80 °C and 0% RH (Figure 2a) remained orange until it was uncovered. This indicates
that even though the Petri dishes are not sealed, they retain SVA
solvent for the duration of SVA.

Figure 2 SEM images of BiI3 films on
FTO/TiO2 prepared
in air with the given RH (rows) and temperature (columns) during SVA
[(a) 0% RH/80 °C, (b) 0% RH/100 °C, (c) 0% RH/120 °C,
(d) 70% RH/80 °C, (e) 70% RH/100 °C, and (f) 70% RH/120
°C]. The upper and lower halves of each panel are low- and high-magnification
images of the same sample made at the given RH and T, respectively.
Scale bars are labeled in each image. The colored swatches in the
lower right corners of each panel represent the approximate amount
of time the sample remained orange during the second step of SVA.
Swatches that are primarily orange mean the sample turned orange early
on, whereas all black swatches mean the sample never changed color.
Times inside the swatches indicate the duration for which the films
remained orange.

All films prepared with
SVA at 80 °C turned orange during
step 2 (solvent exposure) of the SVA process, independent of RH. However,
the time it took the films to turn orange increases with RH. The film
prepared at 80 °C and 0% RH (Figure 2a) turned completely orange within 30 s of
solvent addition. For the same temperature, films prepared at 35%
(Figure S5b) and 70% RH (Figure 2d) turned completely orange
7 and 9 min into SVA, respectively. The film prepared at 100 °C
and 0% RH showed a nonuniform behavior: part of the film turned orange
60 s into SVA and part remained black (Figure S6a). The SEM images of the orange part of this film are shown
in Figures 2b and S6b.
This is in good agreement to our initial findings where we observed
morphological differences with films treated with 100 °C SVA
under different ambient humidities. The partial color change indicates
that the portion of the substrate that turned orange experienced a
higher DMF partial pressure than the portion that stayed black. The
region that turned orange was the side of the substrate closest to
the DMF source. During the final step of SVA, where the lid is opened
so that the solvent could escape, all of the films that had turned
orange during SVA immediately turned black again. No color change
was observed for 100 °C + 35% RH (Figure S5e), 100 °C + 70% RH (Figure 2e), or any of the films made at 120 °C
(Figure 2c,f). Visually,
there is a difference between films that turned orange during SVA
and those that stayed black: films that turned orange are hazy, whereas
those that did not change color remain relatively shiny. The haziness
of the films that turned orange during SVA comes from light scattering
at larger domains (1–20 μm) that developed in the film
(Figures 2a,b,d and
S6b).

The films that changed color during SVA at 80 °C
(Figures 2a,d and S5)
have
larger domains sitting on top of the films. Looking at the higher
magnification images, we see that the film is primarily made of clusters
of small (<100 nm diameter) grains. The film that experienced the
plume of DMF (Figure 2b) consists of large platelets (∼15 μm diameter). The
differences between this case and the 80 °C cases are attributable
to the high DMF concentration in the plume. All of the films that
did not change color are similar (Figure 2c–f), consisting of apparent grain
sizes of 300–500 nm diameter, as determined by SEM. This means
that as long as the films do not change color during SVA, dense, large-grained
films can be grown.

Films made inside and outside of a glovebox
with the same SVA condition
have similar morphologies. For instance, films made with SVA at 120
°C and 70% RH inside (Figure S7a)
and outside (Figure S7b) a glovebox show
similar SEM grain size (300–500 nm) and polydispersity. This
shows that the ambient environment does not have a big impact on morphology.
We will focus on films prepared outside a glovebox for the rest of
our discussion. Full comparison of glovebox and air films is given
in the Supporting Information (Figures S4 and S5).

Mechanism behind the Effects of Water, Temperature,
and Solvent
We explain the role of SVA temperature and water
concentration
by considering the BiI3–DMF complexation chemistry.
Nørby et al.28 have determined via
single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) that the carbonyl oxygen in
DMF complexes with the Bi3+ center to give a solvent complex
crystal with a unit cell of Bi(DMF)8–Bi3I12. Octahedral complexes such as BiI3 typically
undergo ligand exchange via a dissociative interchange mechanism (Id).39 In an Id mechanism, the bond with the incoming group
is formed at the same time the bond with the leaving group is broken.
In our case, the incoming group is the carbonyl group on the DMF and
the leaving group is an iodide anion. Bi3+ is a Lewis acid
of intermediate hardness. The oxygen in the DMF carbonyl group is
a hard base, and the iodide anion is a soft base.40 As a result, Bi3+ is expected to have a similar
ability to complex with the carbonyl oxygen in DMF and the iodide.
Furthermore, as has been shown by Sanderson et al., the bond dissociation
enthalpy of the Bi–I bond is the smallest for the Bi–halides
(i.e., the Bi–I bond is easier to break than other Bi–halide
bonds).41 The character of the bond is
largely ionic, and the large ionic radius of the iodide anion means
it is held less strongly by the Bi3+ center because of
electron–electron repulsion between Bi and I. The ionic character
of the Bi–I bond is critical for facile DMF complexation. The Id mechanism requires a good leaving group. Because
the Bi–I bond is more ionic than covalent and thus more easily
broken, the iodide makes a good leaving group, allowing the DMF to
readily complex with the Bi3+ center.

We first consider
the water-free (DMF vapor only) 80 °C case. The spin-coated crystalline
BiI3 film is made up of BiI6 octahedra arranged
in two-dimensional (2D) sheets.21 Consider
a single BiI6 octahedron exposed to DMF vapor. The DMF
approaches the Bi3+ center and begins to form a Bi–OR
complex with the DMF carbonyl oxygen. At the same time, the Bi–I
bond is being broken and the I– leaves. This reaction
continues to take place until the Bi center is coordinated to eight
DMF molecules [Bi(DMF)8]3+, which is charge-balanced
by a [Bi3I12]3– group. If
enough DMF is present, the entire film is transformed to a DMF–BiI3 coordination compound. This compound may crystallize with
a unit cell composed of four Bi(DMF)8–Bi3I12 pairs, as shown by Nørby et al.28 We note that BiI3 also coordinates with DMSO
and THF, the solvent system for our inks (a more detailed discussion
about this can be found in the Supporting Information).

The BiI3–DMF coordination compound is
the orange
phase witnessed under low RH and low T. The solvent
complex film is thicker than the BiI3 film because of DMF
uptake. The unit cell volume of the BiI3–DMF solvent
crystal is 6507.2 Å3, and it contains four Bi(DMF)8–Bi3I12 moieties, that is, a
volume of 406.7 Å3 per BiI3.28 Pure BiI3, in contrast, has a unit
cell volume of 1016.7 Å3 with six BiI3 moieties
per unit cell,42 that is, a volume of 169
Å3 per BiI3. This means that there is a
volume increase and, concomitantly, a thickness increase of the orange
phase of a factor of 2.4 compared with the BiI3 film. Upon
drying, this film collapses back to the BiI3 film, which
results in a different morphology relative to the initial (pre-SVA)
BiI3 film. This can lead to very rough films with large
BiI3 clusters, as shown in Figure 2a,d or to films with large disconnected platelets,
as shown in Figure S6b. If a BiI3 film is exposed to DMF vapor for a much longer time than 9 min in
our SVA process, then macroscopic morphologies can form, as shown
in Figure S9.

Now, consider the case
of SVA at higher temperatures (T ≈ 120 °C).
We did not observe the orange phase formation
during SVA at this temperature with the DMF concentrations considered.
To better understand this, we collected data to perform a van’t
Hoff analysis (details in the Supporting Information). The reaction considered is 4BiI3 + 8DMF ↔ [Bi(DMF)8]3+[Bi3I12]3–. BiI3 films were placed in sealed vials with different
DMF dosings. The BiI3 films were allowed to complex with
the DMF at room temperature until the orange solvent complex formed.
The vials were then heated in a box oven, slowly increasing the temperature
until the films turned black again. From these temperatures, we get
the equilibrium constant for the BiI3–DMF complexation.
By plotting ln(Keq) versus 1/T, we can extract ΔHrxn and ΔSrxn for the system. On the basis of the stoichiometry
of the above reaction, this yielded values of ΔHrxn of–3 ± 1 eV and ΔSrxn of −0.006 ± 0.003 eV/K per molecular of
the coordination compound. If one assumes that each successive DMF
addition has similar thermodynamics, the enthalpy and entropy are
ΔHrxn of −0.4 eV and ΔSrxn of −0.0007 eV/K per DMF, respectively.
This means that this reaction is enthalpically favorable up to 140
°C, at which point the entropic term begins to dominate. At temperatures
exceeding 140 °C, no concentration of DMF would result in the
films turning orange. The important point here is that at elevated
temperatures, it is more favorable for the DMF to be in the vapor
phase rather than to be complexed with BiI3. It is this
effect that prevents the orange solvent complex from forming at higher
SVA temperatures, independent of RH. For an efficient crystal growth
during SVA, the maximum DMF concentration below the level which leads
to the orange phase is desirable. Thus, our DMF concentration (10
ppm) during SVA is chosen so that the orange solvent complex forms
up to a temperature of 100 °C, which is the ideal temperature
for the SVA process shown previously.27 Larger DMF concentrations would lead to the formation of the orange
phase at higher temperatures; for smaller DMF concentration, the films
would stay black at lower temperatures.

Now, we discuss the
effect of water on the SVA process. At 80 °C,
RH slows down the transformation of the BiI3 into the orange
solvent complex. At 100 °C, the presence of water (≥35%
RH) prevents the film from turning orange at all and results in more
uniform grain growth. To understand this, we note that hydrogens in
water will hydrogen bond with the oxygen in DMF. As a result, the
electron-donating strength (i.e., the Lewis basicity) of the carbonyl
oxygen is reduced. Thus, the DMF is rendered less reactive and will
complex less readily with the BiI3. This would be expected
for cases where the water concentration is equal to or greater than
the DMF concentration, which is true at the DMF–water dosings
used during SVA. This explains the difference we see between films
prepared at 100 °C with 0 and 70% RH.

Effect of Substrates on
Film Morphology
We spin-coated
200 mg/mL BiI3 in THF + 1–2 vol % DMSO onto FTO/TiO2, FTO/ZnO, and ITO/Cu/NiOx substrates.
We observe significantly different film morphologies with the different
substrates. Films grown on TiO2 (Figure 3a) are made of 300–500 nm densely
packed grains. Films grown on ZnO (Figure 3b) are more polydisperse and contain small
and large platelets with sharp edges. Films prepared on copper-doped
nickel oxide (Cu/NiOx) (Figure 3c) are also more polydisperse
than the films grown on TiO2 but also contain large (1
μm dia.) platelets. We rationalize these observations by noting
that film–substrate surface energy differences can influence
film growth. In the cases where substrate surface energy is smaller
than film + interface surface energies, island growth is expected.43 Other factors such as deposition temperature
also can impact crystal growth.21 This
means that by optimizing parameters such as SVA solvent, water concentration,
and temperature, we might be able to obtain dense films with the desired
grain size for each choice of substrate.

and 70% RH on (a) FTO/TiO2, (b) FTO/ZnO, and (c) ITO/Cu/NiOx.

Crystallographic Orientation
XRD spectra for BiI3 films grown at different SVA temperatures and water vapor
concentrations are shown in Figure 4a). The films that turned orange during SVA, that is,
those grown at 80 °C (0% RH and 70% RH) and 100 °C (0% RH)
show a pattern significantly different from the black ones. The most
pronounced XRD peaks for those films are due to reflections at the
(003), (006), and (009) planes, which belong to the same family of
(00l) planes. This indicates a texturing of those
films. In contrast, the films that did not change color during SVA
show much smaller peaks for the (00l) planes. We
observe pronounced reflections at (113) and (300) in these films,
indicating less texturing.

Figure 4 (a) XRD spectra as a function of SVA temperature
and RH. The green
and blue curves show the spectra for those areas that turned orange
and that stayed black, respectively (see Figure 2). The dotted vertical lines indicate BiI3 powder peaks. The solid black vertical lines indicate the
peaks of the FTO substrate. (b) TCs related to the (300) plane (green),
(113) plane (blue), and (003) plane (red) as a function of SVA temperature
for 0% RH (open squares) and 70% RH (open pyramids).

To further study this texturing effect, we evaluate
the texture
coefficient (TC). The TC of a plane (hkl) is defined
as , where I(hkl) is the measured intensity, I0(hkl) is the intensity of the powder
diffraction, and N is the number of planes considered.44 A TC equal to 1 indicates no preferred orientation.
The
TCs for the (300), (113), and (003) planes are shown in Figure 4b for different SVA temperatures
and water concentrations. All films that turned orange during SVA,
that is, at 80 °C show a TC of around 3 for the (003) plane and
of close to 0 for the (113) and (300) planes. We note that the same
TCs are also observed for the films that turned orange during SVA
at 100 °C, 0% RH (not shown in Figure 4b). This indicates a strong texturing: these
films are oriented with their (003) plane predominantly parallel to
the substrate; that is, the BiI3 film is layered in such
a way that the planes which contain edge-shared BiI6 octahedra
are parallel to the substrate. The films that did not change color
do not show this texturing: TCs for the (003) and (113) planes are
between 0.5 and 0.9, whereas the TC for the (300) plane is around
1.5. This indicates a slightly preferred orientation in such a way
that the edge-shared BiI6 planes are perpendicular to the
substrate. Similar texturing has been found in BiI3 films
that have formed from BiI3–DMSO complexes.28 Because the 2D sheets of edge-shared BiI6 octahedra are only weakly connected by van der Waals forces,
it is expected that in-plane transport should exhibit larger mobility
than perpendicular to the 2D sheets. Hence, the films that turned
orange during SVA should show a better carrier transport parallel
to the substrate and worse transport perpendicular to the substrate
plane than the films that did not change color. We will come back
to this point later.

Optoelectronic Quality
We performed
AIPL measurements
at a PV device relevant excitation laser intensity comparable to one
sun. PL measurements on BiI3 films have been carried out
previously;21,27 however, because the PL quantum
yield (PLQY) is very low, those measurements used laser excitation
intensities comparable to >100 sun. Here, we were able to measure
BiI3 AIPL at 1 sun effective intensity. This was enabled
by both the high quality of the films and a modification to our measurement
technique (see the Supporting Information for details).

The AIPL is peaked at 1.78 eV with a full width
at half-max of 180 meV (Figure 5a, blue trace). This is very close to the measured band gap
of 1.79 eV determined from UV–vis absorption measurements (Figure 5a, red trace). The
fact that the PL peak is right at the band edge indicates that sub-band
gap states should not cause a significant loss of voltage. From AIPL,
we get the PLQY, which we used to calculate the QFLS (Figure 5b) with the method described
in Braly and Hillhouse.33 The QFLS is an
indication of the maximum voltage Voc achievable
by a solar cell device. QFLS is proportional to kT ln(1/PLQY). Therefore, what may appear as larger differences in
PLQY does not correspond to as large differences in QFLS. In Figure 5b, we also show the
ratio of the measured QFLS to the Shockley–Queisser QFLS (QFLSSQ) for a material with the same band gap, χ = QFLS/QFLSSQ.33 χ may be considered
to be the optoelectronic quality of the material. All films prepared
at 80 °C as well as the film prepared at 100 °C with 0%
RH have PLQY < 1 × 10–7. Those were the
films that turned orange during SVA. The films prepared at 100 °C
with 35 and 70% RH and all 120 °C films have PLQY values of 2
× 10–7%. These films remained black during
SVA.

QFLS, and χ from 1 sun AIPL of BiI3 films prepared

photoconductive diffusion length measurements of BiI3 films

The lower PLQY films were the films that had turned orange
during
SVA, whereas the higher PLQY values were obtained from the films that
did not change color during SVA. PLQY was greater by 2–6 times
in the films that did not change color during SVA. This may be understood
as an effect of the grain size. The films that turned orange during
SVA have grains with diameters ≤100 nm. The films that remained
black have grains 300–500 nm in size. The differences in PLQY
may be attributed to nonradiative recombination at the grain boundaries.
The smaller grained films have a greater number of grain boundaries,
meaning that nonradiative recombination would be greater. However,
we cannot exclude differences in the bulk. Films that turned orange
during SVA may have entrained DMF within the crystalline BiI3. This may give rise to different point defects and contribute to
nonradiative recombination.

Coming back to our discussion on
transport, a lateral dc photoconductivity
method34,35 was used to estimate the lateral diffusion
length to assess the impact of SVA on carrier transport. The diffusion
length (LD) determined from this technique
is an average (root mean square) of the electron and hole diffusion
lengths. A slight trend is observed toward higher diffusion lengths
with increasing temperature and RH from 40 nm at 80 °C/0% RH
to 55 nm at 120 °C/0% RH and 70 nm at 120 °C/70% RH, as
shown in Figure 5c.
Because these are lateral diffusion lengths, that is, the carriers
flow parallel to the substrate, this behavior is contradictory to
what we would expect from the above discussion on texturing of the
films: carrier transport is expected to be better for films that turned
orange during SVA (i.e., at 80 °C/0% RH and 80 °C/70% RH),
which is obviously not the case. One likely reason for this is the
much lower grain size of the films that changed color during SVA compared
to the films that did not change color (see Figure 2), giving rise to significantly more grain
boundaries, which reduces the carrier mobility. In addition, the lifetime
of photoexcited carriers in the films that turned orange during SVA
is significantly lower than that in the films that did not change
color because of the higher recombination rate as indicated by the
lower PLQY. Because the diffusion length is proportional to the mobility-lifetime
product, the latter two effects counterbalance the beneficial texturing
effects of the films that turned orange during SVA as compared to
the films that did not change color.

PV Devices
We
made PV devices to assess the impact
of SVA on PV performance. An ideal band diagram (assuming no ion migration,
intrinsic BiI3, no mass transport across the interfaces,
and no surface chemistry/interface dipoles) and a device architecture
schematic are shown in Figure 6a and the inset of 6b, respectively.
We report current density versus voltage (JV) curves
and time-dependent PCE (using maximum power-point tracking45) under continuous simulated AM1.5G illumination.
The best solar cell with the optimized SVA process (120 °C +
70% RH) has a stabilized PCE (Figure 6b, blue curve) of 0.51%. A device made from a film
that turned orange during SVA (e.g., 80 °C + 70% RH) in the same
architecture shows a much lower stabilized PCE of 0.04% (Figure 6b, orange curve).

Figure 6 (a) Equilibrium
band diagram of FTO/TiO2/BiI3/spiro-OMeTAD (SOMT)
at short circuit. The dashed red line indicates
the Fermi level. (b) Maximum power-point tracking curves for devices
made with 120 °C/70% RH (blue curve) and 80 °C/70% RH (orange
curve). The inset shows device stack. (c) Light (blue) and dark (orange) JV curves for the 120 °C and 70% RH device. (d) Light
(blue) and dark (orange) JV curves for the 80 °C
and 0% RH device.

This more than 1 order
of magnitude lower PCE comes mainly from
two factors, a significantly lower photocurrent and a much lower fill
factor due to the s-shaped JV. We note that the lower
photocurrent very likely stems from a much lower carrier diffusion
length perpendicular to the substrate for the films that turned orange
during SVA. This is expected from the texturing effects discussed
above, the lower carrier lifetime due to the lower PLQY, and the lower
mobility due to the increased number of grain boundaries.

While
the band alignment shown in Figure 6a suggests that an electric field should
be present across the device to assist with carrier collection, if
charged iodide vacancies migrate (as in hybrid perovskite solar cells)
to screen the internal field, then carrier diffusion would have to
be relied on for carrier collection.23,46 The relatively
low diffusion lengths measured (70 nm) could then partly explain the
low short-circuit current (Jsc) of 4.14
mA/cm2. Another contributing factor to the low photocurrent
could be the misalignment of the conduction band edges (CBES) of TiO2 and BiI3. An ab initio calculated value for the
CBE for BiI3 is 4.1 eV, and the accepted value for TiO2 is 4.2 eV below vacuum.22 These
are very close, and if correct would not yield a barrier for electron
extraction. However, if the actual band edge position of BiI3 is different, it may cause a barrier for electron injection from
BiI3 into TiO2.

The large differences
between the light and dark curves suggest
further device issues, such as a light-dependent saturation current,
photoexcited carrier screening of electrostatic barriers at the interfaces
(not shown in the band diagram), voltage-dependent photocurrent, and
light-dependent shunt and series resistances. The table in Figure S10b shows the results of fitting the
nonideal diode equation to the light and dark curves for the device
made at 120 °C and 70% RH (Figure S10a). The reverse saturation currents (J0), series resistances, and shunt resistances all differ by more than
an order of magnitude.

With regard to the low voltage, the low
diffusion length may play
a role as well, as it signifies significant nonradiative recombination.
Furthermore, the band alignment also likely plays an important role.
With regard to the hole-extracting contact, the band edge of the spiro-OMeTAD
lies 5.1 eV below vacuum,47 and the position
of the BiI3 valence band is 6.0 eV below vacuum.22 While one would not expect a barrier for hole
extraction, voltage could be lost because of the large offset between
the BiI3 valence band and the spiro-OMeTAD Fermi level.

Conclusions
We have
explored the mechanisms behind the BiI3 film
formation process and demonstrated the roles that temperature and
water play in the solvent annealing process for BiI3 layers.
We developed a reliable process for growing large-grained, continuous
films. Films with small grains and poor morphologies result in reduced
device performance and optoelectronic quality. Performing SVA with
precise dosing of water and DMF grows uniform films with a SEM-based
morphological grain size of 300–500 nm. Water acts to moderate
the influence of DMF during the SVA process, allowing more controlled
growth to occur. Higher temperatures also moderate the action of DMF.

We used highly concentrated BiI3–THF inks (200
mg/mL) and observed severe cracking of the films upon spin-coating
and drying. Modifying the ink chemistry by addition of 1–2
vol % DMSO, we successfully prevented film cracking and obtained homogeneous
and smooth films.

Formation of the orange BiI3–DMF
complex during
SVA at low temperatures results in films with a preferred orientation:
the planes corresponding to the 2D sheets of BiI6 octahedra
are oriented parallel to the substrate. From diffusion length measurements
and device characterization, we obtained clear indication for very
poor transport in the direction perpendicular to these planes. The
reason is the weak van der Waals interaction of these 2D sheets. This
shows that for the structurally two-dimensional material BiI3, the film texture is an essential parameter for its application
in optoelectronic devices.

From AIPL measurements, we determined
a QFLS of 1.1 eV at 1 sun,
which is a measure for the maximum photovoltage that can be obtained
in a solar cell. This is a promising result because an optimized solar
cell with BiI3 as the absorber material only limited by
this QFLS could achieve >15% PCE.

A QFLS of 1.1 eV is 73%
of the Shockley–Queisser limit for
BiI3, which indicates that there is still room for improvements
via defect passivation. However, it also indicates that bulk nonradiative
recombination is not the main reason for the low voltage of state-of-the-art
BiI3 solar cells. Both the large voltage deficit and current
deficit seen in BiI3 devices are a consequence of low diffusion
length and nonoptimal band alignment.

This work reveals the
mechanisms behind the film formation process
of BiI3 films, which are potentially also applicable to
other metal halide materials. It further expands the understanding
of the relationship between the chemistry and physics of BiI3 films and devices, opening the door for improving device efficiencies.
Further development of this material could enable it to become a competitor
to PbI2-based hybrid perovskites while avoiding the toxicity
and potentially also the stability issues of the perovskite material.

Experimental
Section
Materials
BiI3 inks (200 mg/mL) were prepared
by dissolving BiI3 (99.999%, Alfa Aesar) in anhydrous THF
(99.9%, inhibitor-free, Sigma-Aldrich) inside a N2-filled
glovebox. The inks were sealed and then mixed with an ultrasonicator
immediately before use. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates
(14 × 14 mm2) (TEC 7, Sigma-Aldrich) were sequentially
cleaned by sonication in a detergent solution, DI water, acetone,
and 2-propanol for 10 min. Substrates were cleaned with an Ar plasma
immediately before use. TiO2 solutions were prepared by
mixing 10 mL of ethanol (200 proof, Sigma-Aldrich), 69 μL of
HCl (37 wt %, aq, Macron Fine Chemicals), and 0.727 mL of Ti(IV) ethoxide
(Aldrich) and sonicating it for 30 min. This solution was spin-coated
onto the FTO substrates in air at 2000 rpm for 15 s. Substrates were
coated twice, with a 500 °C anneal in a box oven between layers.
BiI3 inks were deposited on the TiO2-coated
substrates by spin-coating at 2000 rpm for 35 s inside a N2-filled glovebox and in a fume hood. After spin-coating, the films
were solvent vapor-annealed for 10 min with DMF–water mixtures.
SVA consists of three steps: (1) the as spin-coated BiI3 film is set inside a Petri dish on a hot plate; (2) after 60 s,
the solvent is added to the Petri dish with the film and the lid is
closed; and (3) after 9 min, the lid is removed so that the film is
exposed to the ambient atmosphere for 60 s to remove residual DMF
and water. DMF volume was held constant at 6.4 μL, and water
content was varied to achieve 0, 35, or 70% RH at 80, 100, or 120
°C. See Figure S1 and Table S1 in the Supporting Information for details on the SVA setup and water concentrations.
hole transport layers were prepared by spin-coating spiro-OMeTAD,
as described elsewhere.9 The spiro-OMeTAD
was doped with Li and Co and oxidized overnight. Devices were finished
by thermal evaporation of 100 nm Au at a base pressure of 1 ×
10–6 Torr.

Characterization
SEM images were
collected at a 5 kV
accelerating voltage with an FEI XL830 Dual Beam SEM/FIB. Crystallographic
measurements were collected with a Bruker D8 Discover XRD. AIPL measurements
were collected at 1 sun photon flux with an apparatus described previously.32,33 The 1 sun condition used corresponds to a photon flux of 1.28 ×
1021 photons/s m2 at a laser wavelength of 532
nm. A 150 lines/mm Czerny–Turner monochromator blazed at 500
nm was used to collect the signal. PLQY and the peak position were
used to calculate the QFLS and the optoelectronic quality (χ).33 PV devices were tested in air using an AAA solar
simulator (Oriel Sol3A) and a Keithley 2400 SMU. A photoconductivity
method was used to determine the mean carrier diffusion length34,35 using a bias of +20 V with a 432 nm blue light-emitting diode at
3.66 × 1021 photons/s m2 flux, which is
2.8 sun equivalent for a 1.8 eV band gap material. Photoconductivity
measurements were made inside a temperature-controlled stage held
at 20 °C.
