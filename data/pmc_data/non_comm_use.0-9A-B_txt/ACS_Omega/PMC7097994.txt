Food
additives, such as hypochlorous acid water, sodium metabisulfite,
and sodium sulfite, strongly affect the chemical and biological properties
of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) in aqueous solution. When
cyanocobalamin (10 μmol/L) was treated with these compounds,
hypochlorous acid water (an effective chlorine concentration of 30
ppm) rapidly reacted with cyanocobalamin. The maximum absorptions
at 361 and 550 nm completely disappeared by 1 h, and vitamin B12 activity was lost. There were no significant changes observed
in the absorption spectra of cyanocobalamin for 0.01% (w/v) sodium
metabisulfite; however, a small amount of the reaction product was
formed within 48 h, which was subsequently identified as sulfitocobalamin
through high-performance liquid chromatography. Similar results were
shown for sodium sulfite. The effects of these food additives on the
vitamin B12 content of red shrimp and beef meats were determined,
revealing no significant difference in vitamin B12 content
of shrimp and beef meats with or without the treatment even in hypochlorous
acid water. The results suggest that these food additives could not
react with food vitamin B12 in food, as most of this vitamin
present in food is its protein-bound form rather than the free form.

==== Body
Introduction
Vitamin B12 or cobalamin (B12) is a well-established
member of corrinoids.1 B12 is
synthesized by certain archaea and bacteria but not by animals or
plants.2 B12 synthesized by
bacteria and archaea is accumulated in animal tissues through the
natural food chain.2 Thus, animal-derived
foods are good sources of B12 for humans.3,4 Consequently, strict vegetarians are at a greater risk of developing
B12 deficiency.5

Following
analysis of B12 compounds in various foods
using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, certain foods
contained a substantial amount of pseudovitamin B12,6−8 which has adenine in place of 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole as base
in the lower nucleotide of the molecule.1 Moreover, an unnatural and inactive B12 compound, B12 [c-lactone], was found in some edible mushrooms.9,10 B12 [c-lactone] was readily formed from B12 by treatment with the organochlorine antibacterial agent chloramine-T.10 In addition, preliminary experiments indicate
that B12 is completely inactivated upon treatment with
hypochlorous acid water. Hypochlorous acid is usually used to sanitize
food products such as vegetables, fruits, and meat.11−13 This acid is
widely used in the food industry as the disinfection agents of food
processing equipment.12,13 However, hypochlorous acid readily
reacts with proteins to form an aggregate and oxidizes specific amino
acids.14,15 High hypochlorous acid treatment reportedly
induces a significant decrease of vitamin C content in vegetables.16 There is limited information on the disadvantages
associated with the use of hypochlorous acid. If hypochlorous acid
has the ability to readily degrade B12, ingestion of the
formed products might induce B12 deficiency in humans.
To study whether such B12 degradation products formed by
hypochlorous acid are harmful to humans, some of these compounds,
which were unstable, were purified and characterized in this study.

Furthermore, other preliminary experiments indicate that food additives
such as sodium metabisulfite15 and sodium
sulfite17,18 had the ability to change the ultraviolet-visible
(UV–visible) absorption maxima of B12 in aqueous
solution. These results and observations suggest the possibility that
B12 is readily inactivated by treatment with these food
additives; hence, its nutritional values may be significantly reduced.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of hypochlorous acid water,
sodium metabisulfite, and sodium sulfite on the chemical and biological
properties of B12 under aqueous conditions. Furthermore,
we examined whether significant loss of B12 occurs in food
treated with these food additives.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Cyanocobalamin (CN-B12) and hydroxocobalamin
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Sulfitocobalamin
was synthesized from hydroxocobalamin by treatment with sodium sulfite
according to the method described by Suarez-Moreira et al.19 Food additives, such as hypochlorous acid water,
sodium metabisulfite, and sodium sulfite were purchased from markets
in Japan. Argentine red shrimp (Pleoticus muelleri [Bate]) was purchased from a local market in Tottori City, Japan.

UV-Visible Spectra of CN-B12 Treated with or without
Food Additives in Aqueous Solution
Hypochlorous acid water
was adjusted to an effective chlorine concentration of 30 ppm using
an effective chlorine concentration measurement kit (AQ-102P; SIBATA
Scientific Technology Ltd., Saitama, Japan). The other food additives
(i.e., sodium metabisulfite and sodium sulfite) were dissolved in
distilled water at a concentration of 0.01% (w/v). CN-B12 was dissolved in these food additive solutions at a final concentration
of 10 μmol/L. These solutions were left for 0, 1, 24, and 48
h at room temperature (25 °C). At the indicated time points,
the UV–visible absorption spectra of these solutions were measured
using a UV–visible spectrophotometer (UV-2550; SHIMADZU Corp.,
Kyoto, Japan).

High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
Analysis of B12 Compounds Formed by Treatment with These
Food Additives
CN-B12 was treated with hypochlorous
acid water (an
effective chlorine concentration of 10 ppm) for 1 h as described above.
Subsequently, the treated CN-B12 solution was immediately
loaded onto a Sep-Pak Vac (5 g) C18 cartridge (Waters Corp., Milford,
MA) equilibrated with 20 mL of distilled water after washing with
20 mL of 75% (v/v) ethanol solution. The C18 cartridge was washed
with 20 mL of distilled water, and the B12 compounds were
eluted with 75% (v/v) ethanol solution. The eluate was allowed to
evaporate to dryness under reduced pressure, dissolved in a small
amount of water, and subsequently used as a sample for HPLC analysis.
The Shimadzu HPLC apparatus (SPD-10AV UV–Visible detector,
SCL-10A VP system controller, DGU-20A3 degasser, LC-10Ai Pumps, CTO-6A
column oven) and CDS ver. 5 chromato-data processing system (LAsoft,
Ltd., Chiba, Japan) were used. An aliquot (30 μL) of the sample
was placed on a reversed-phase HPLC column (Wakosil–II 5C18RS
Φ 4.6 × 150 mm2; particle size 5 μm),
which was equilibrated at 40 °C with 20% (v/v) methanol containing
1% (v/v) acetic acid at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The B12 compounds were eluted for 20 min with a linear gradient of 20–90%
(v/v) methanol solution containing 1% (v/v) acetic acid, followed
by elution with 90% (v/v) methanol solution containing 1% (v/v) acetic
acid for 10 min, and were monitored by measuring the absorbance at
361 nm. The B12 compounds were eluted as major six peaks
with retention times of 8.6 (P-1), 10.9 (P-2), 12.3 (P-3), 14.7 (P-4),
15.9 (P-5), and 17.1 min (P-6). These peak fractions were collected
and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure and dissolved in
a small amount of water. Each peak fraction was further purified using
a reversed-phase HPLC under the same conditions. The B12 compounds P-2, P-3, and P-6 were homogeneously purified; however,
we failed to purify the remaining B12 compounds owing to
their instability.

CN-B12 was treated with sodium
metabisulfite or sodium sulfite for 48 h as described above and immediately
placed on a reversed-phase HPLC column (Wakosil–II 5C18RS Φ
4.6 × 150 mm2; particle size 5 μm), which was
equilibrated at 40 °C with 20% (v/v) methanol containing 1% (v/v)
acetic acid at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The B12 compounds
were isocratically eluted under the same conditions and monitored
by measuring the absorbance at 361 nm.

B12-Dependent Escherichia coli 215 Bioautography of the B12 Compounds Formed by Hypochlorous
Acid Water
Bioautography of B12 compounds was
performed as previously described.20 An
aliquot (2 μL) of the partially purified sample (50 μg/L)
using the Sep-Pak Vac (5 g) C18 cartridge as described above. The
authentic CN-B12 (50 μg/L) were spotted on filter
papers (circle; 8 mm), which were placed on 1.5% (w/v) agar containing
a basal medium of E. coli 215 and incubated
at 37 °C for approximately 20 h. The agar plate was sprayed with
a methanol solution containing 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium salt to
enable visualization of the B12 compounds, indicating E. coli growth.

Proton Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (1H NMR) Spectroscopy
of the B12 Compounds Formed by Hypochlorous Acid Water
Purified B12 compounds with respective retention times
of 10.9 (P-2), 12.3 (P-3), and 17.1 min (P-6) were analyzed using 1H NMR spectroscopy to characterize their chemical structures
formed after treatment with hypochlorous acid water. NMR spectra were
measured with a Bruker DRX500 (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA). The
spectra of compounds A–C were obtained in deuterium oxide at
room temperature. Chemical shifts are given on a δ (ppm) scale
with 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic acid-d4 sodium salt (TSP) used as an internal standard.

Effect of These
Food Additives on the B12 Content
of Red Shrimp Meat
The edible portion (approximately 150
g) of Argentine red shrimps was collected and homogenized using a
mortar and pestle. Subsequently, 1.0 mL of hypochlorous acid water
(an effective chlorine concentration of 30 ppm), 0.1% (w/v) sodium
metabisulfite solution, or 0.1% (w/v) sodium sulfite solution, and
distilled water (control) were added to each 10 g of the shrimp meat
homogenate, followed by thorough mixing. Three sets of putties (3
× 3 × 1 cm3) from each sample were formed and
subsequently allowed to stand at 4 °C for 48 h in the dark. B12 was extracted from aliquots (2.0 g) of each stored sample
and determined using Lactobacillus delbrueckii American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA) 7830 bioassay
as previously described.21

Effect of Various
Concentrations of Hypochlorous Acid Water
on the B12 Content of Beef Meat
Ground beef meat
was treated with 1.0 mL of hypochlorous acid water (effective chlorine
concentrations of 30, 60, and 80 ppm), followed by thorough mixing.
Three sets of putties (3 × 3 × 1 cm3) from each
beef meat were formed and subsequently allowed to stand at 4 °C
for 48 h in the dark. B12 was extracted and assayed as
described above.

Statistical Analysis
One-way analysis
of variance and
post-hoc analysis were performed using Dunnett’s multiple comparison
tests to evaluate the effect of food additives on the B12 content of red shrimp meat and to determine the effect of various
concentrations of hypochlorous acid water on the B12 content
of ground beef meat. Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism
3 for Windows version 2.01 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA).
Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). p < 0.05 denoted statistically significant differences.

Results
UV–Visible Spectra of CN-B12 Treated with
or without Selected Food Additives in an Aqueous Solution
On the basis of preliminary experiments, hypochlorous acid water,
sodium metabisulfite, and sodium sulfite were selected as food additives.
Changes in the UV–visible spectra of CN-B12 after
treatment with these food additives were monitored for 48 h to determine
the degree of reaction in aqueous solution. The UV–visible
absorption spectrum of a reaction mixture containing CN-B12 and hypochlorous acid water (an effective chlorine concentration
of 30 ppm) showed that the absorption peak at 278 nm, which is the
specific wavelength of CN-B12, disappeared from 0 h. Other
specific absorption peaks at 361 and 550 nm were also shifted to 365
and to 586 nm, respectively, and thereafter were significantly decreased
(Figure 1A). These
specific absorption maxima of CN-B12 completely disappeared
by 1 h.

Figure 1 UV–visible absorption spectra of CN-B12 after
treatment with these food additives. CN-B12 was dissolved
in hypochlorous acid water (at an effective chlorine concentration
of 30 ppm) (A), 0.01% (w/v) sodium metabisulfite (B), and 0.01% (w/v)
solution sodium sulfite (C) solutions at a final concentration of
10 μmol/L. These solutions were left for 0 h (—), 1 h
(− − −), 24 h (- - -),
and 48 h (······) at room temperature
(25 °C). A solution of CN-B12 treated without these
food additives was used as control (—). At the indicated time
points, the UV–visible absorption spectra of these solutions
were measured using a UV–visible spectrophotometer. These are
typical spectrophotometric data obtained from three independent experiments.

Addition of 0.01% (w/v) sodium metabisulfite indicated
that the
specific absorption peaks at 278 and 361 nm were slightly increased
and thereafter decreased during the time course; however, these specific
absorption maxima of CN-B12 were hardly changed for 48
h (Figure 1B). Sodium
sulfite also showed similar spectroscopic behavior (Figure 1C).

B12 Compounds
Formed during Treatment with Hypochlorous
Acid Water
The B12 compounds formed after treatment
with these compounds were analyzed using HPLC to determine the effects
of these food additives on the chemical structure and biological activity
of CN-B12. When CN-B12 treated with hypochlorous
acid water for 60 min was analyzed using a reversed-phase HPLC, there
were no peaks observed with retention times of 7.2 and 7.7 min, which
are derived from authentic CN-B12 and B12 [c-lactone], respectively. Instead, the B12 compounds
were eluted as major six peaks with respective retention times of
8.6 (P-1), 10.9 (P-2), 12.3 (P-3), 14.7 (P-4), 15.9 (P-5), and 17.1
min (P-6) (Figure 2). The compounds P-2, P-3, and P-6 could be purified and subjected
to 1H NMR spectroscopy.

Figure 2 HPLC patterns of the B12 compounds
treated with hypochlorous
acid water. CN-B12 was dissolved in hypochlorous acid water
(at an effective chlorine concentration of 10 ppm) at a final concentration
of 10 μmol/L and left for 1 h at room temperature (25 °C)
in the dark. The CN-B12 solution was loaded onto a Sep-Pak
Vac (5 g) C18 cartridge to remove the hypochlorous acid. The fraction
of the B12 compounds was dissolved in a small amount of
water and subsequently used as a sample for HPLC analysis. An aliquot
(30 μL) of the sample was placed on a reversed-phase HPLC column.
The B12 compounds were eluted for 20 min with a linear
gradient of 20–90% (v/v) methanol solution containing 1% (v/v)
acetic acid, followed by elution with 90% (v/v) methanol solution
containing 1% (v/v) acetic acid for 10 min, and were monitored by
measuring the absorbance at 361 nm. The HPLC patterns of the B12 compounds are typical data obtained from three independent
experiments.

We compared the 1H
NMR spectra of the purified compounds
with that of authentic CN-B12 (Figure 3). In the spectrum of compound P-2 (Figure 4A), the signal corresponding
to the olefinic proton at C10 disappeared, whereas the characteristic
signals coupled with each other at δH 3.86 (1H, d, J = 19.0 Hz) and δH 3.15 (1H, d, J = 19.0 Hz) appeared. Thus, the carbon at this position
may have been saturated by the treatment. The signal corresponding
to R1 (δH 6.39) indicated the presence of a ribose
group. Furthermore, signals corresponding to methyl groups B10, B11,
and Pr3 were also detected, indicating the presence of dimethylbenzimidazole
and β-aminoisopropyl groups. All of the remaining methyl groups
(C53, C35, C25, C36, C54, C47, C46, and C20) on the corrin ring appeared
at chemical shifts similar to authentic vitamin B12.

Figure 3 1H NMR spectrum of authentic CN-B12.

Figure 4 1H NMR spectra of B12 compounds formed during
treatment with hypochlorous acid water. (A), Compound P-2 (with a
retention time of 10.9 min); (B), compound P-3 (with a retention time
of 12.3 min); and (C) compound P-6 (with a retention time of 17.1
min).

The spectra of compounds P-2 and
P-3 (Figures 4A,B)
were very similar to each other; however,
the values of the chemical shift of the signals were different. The
signals corresponding to B2, B4, B7, and R1 indicated the presence
of dimethylbenzimidazole and a ribose group. All methyl groups corresponding
to B12 were detected in the spectrum, indicating that the
corrin ring skeleton and β-aminoisopropyl groups were retained
in compound P-3. Therefore, compounds P-2 and P-3 may be structural
isomers.

The signal corresponding to B4 at δH 7.32 remained
on the dimethylbenzimidazole ring in the spectrum of compound P-6
(Figure 4C), whereas
the signal corresponding to B7 disappeared. Thus, the B7 position
on the dimethylbenzimidazole group was likely substituted by treatment.
The chemical shifts of the signals of methyl groups at C35 and C53
(δH 2.62 and 2.61 ppm) showed high-magnetic field
shifts. Additionally, the signal corresponding to the methyl group
at C20 disappeared. Thus, the conjugation system of the corrin ring
was modified by treatment.

B12 Compounds Formed during Treatment
with Sodium
Metabisulfite and Sodium Sulfite
Following the treatment
of CN-B12 with sodium metabisulfite for 48 h and analysis
using reversed-phase HPLC, the B12 compounds were isocratically
eluted as major and minor peaks with retention times of 8.7 and 27.5
min, respectively (Figure 5A).

Figure 5 HPLC patterns of the B12 compounds treated with 0.01%
(w/v) sodium metabisulfite. CN-B12 was dissolved in 0.01%
(w/v) sodium metabisulfite solution at a final concentration of 10
μmol/L and left for 48 h at room temperature (25 °C) in
the dark. (A) Treated CN-B12 solution (50 μL) or
(B) authentic sulfitocobalamin (20 μL of 130 mg/L) was loaded
onto a reversed-phase HPLC column. The B12 compounds were
isocratically eluted and monitored by measuring the absorbance at
361 nm. Data are typical HPLC patterns of the B12 compounds
treated with sodium metabisulfite or authentic sulfitocobalamin obtained
from three independent experiments.

The major peak with a retention time of 8.7 min was identical to
that of authentic CN-B12 (data not shown), suggesting that
most CN-B12 was not changed by treatment with sodium metabisulfite.
Previous studies reported that hydroxocobalamin was readily converted
to sulfitocobalamin by the addition of sodium sulfite.19,22 When sulfitocobalamin was prepared and analyzed using HPLC, the
minor peak with a retention time of 27.5 min was identical to that
of sulfitocobalamin (Figure 5B). Similar results were obtained for sodium sulfite (data
not shown).

Biological Activity of the B12 Compounds Formed during
Treatment with Selected Food Additives
Sulfitocobalamin is
well established as a naturally occurring biologically active B12.23 The minor peak (with a retention
time of 27.5 min) formed by the addition of sodium metabisulfite or
sodium sulfite (Figure 5A) was active in B12-dependent E. coli 215 (data not shown). However, based on the absence of bacterial
growth, B12-dependent E. coli 215 bioautography of hypochlorous acid-treated B12 compounds
indicated that hypochlorous acid water readily inactivated CN-B12 in aqueous solution (Figure 6).

acid water on B12-dependent E. coli 215. (A) Authentic B12 (100 pg) and (B) hypochlorous
acid-treated B12 compounds after purification using a Sep-Pak
Vac (5 g) C18 cartridge.

Effect of the Selected
Food Additives on the B12 Content
of Red Shrimp Meat
In Japan, sodium metabisulfite and sodium
sulfite are typically used to prevent black discoloration in shrimps.
Hypochlorous acid water (an effective chlorine concentration of 30
ppm), 0.1% (w/v) sodium metabisulfite solution, 0.1% (w/v) sodium
sulfite solution, and distilled water (control) were added to red
shrimp meats and then stored for 48 h at 4 °C in the dark to
determine whether these food additives can reduce the B12 content in food. B12 was extracted from the red shrimp
meat treated with or without these food additives, and its amount
was determined using the L. delbrueckii ATCC 7830 bioassay. To evaluate the effect of food additives on
the B12 content of red shrimp meat, one-way analysis of
variance and post-hoc analysis were performed using Dunnett’s
multiple comparison tests. When p < 0.05 denoted
statistically significant differences, there was no significant decrease
detected in the B12 content of the red shrimp meat treated
with these food additives (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Effects of treatment with hypochlorous acid water, sodium
metabisulfite,
and sodium sulfite on the B12 content of red shrimp meat.
The edible portion of Argentine red shrimps was collected and homogenized
using a mortar and pestle. The shrimp meat homogenate (10 g) was treated
with 1.0 mL of distilled water as a control (1), hypochlorous acid
water (at an effective chlorine concentration of 30 ppm) (2), 0.1%
(w/v) sodium metabisulfite solution (3), and 0.1% (w/v) sodium sulfite
solution (4) and subsequently mixed. Three sets of putties (3 ×
3 × 1 cm3) from each sample were formed and then allowed
to stand at 4 °C for 48 h in the dark. The B12 was
extracted from each stored sample, and its amount was determined using L. delbrueckii ATCC 7830 bioassay. B12 content was assayed in triplicate. Data are represented as means
± SEM (n = 3).

Effect of Various Concentrations of Hypochlorous Acid Water
on the B12 Content of Ground Beef Meat
Hypochlorous
acid is usually used to sanitize vegetables, fruits, and meat.11−13 As animal-derived foods are good sources of B12 for humans,3,4 the effect of various concentrations of hypochlorous acid on the
B12 content of beef meat was evaluated. Effective chlorine
concentrations of 30, 60, and 80 ppm of hypochlorous acid water and
distilled water (control) were added to ground beef meats and then
stored for 48 h at 4 °C in the dark. B12 was extracted
from the ground beef meat treated with or without hypochlorous acid
water, and its amount was determined using the bioassay. The B12 content of the ground beef meat gradually decreased with
increased effective chlorine concentrations of hypochlorous acid,
but there was no significant difference among these values (Figure 8).

Figure 8 Effects of various concentrations
of hypochlorous acid water on
the B12 content of ground beef meat. Ground beef meat (10
g) was treated with 1.0 mL of distilled water as a control (1) and
treated with 1.0 mL of hypochlorous acid water at effective chlorine
concentrations of 30 ppm (2), 60 ppm (3), and 80 ppm (4) and subsequently
mixed. Three sets of putties (3 × 3 × 1 cm3)
from each sample were formed and then allowed to stand at 4 °C
for 48 h in the dark. B12 was extracted from each stored
sample, and its amount was determined using L. delbrueckii ATCC 7830 bioassay. B12 content was assayed in triplicate.
Data are represented as means ± SEM (n = 3).

Discussion
An unnatural and inactive
B12 compound, B12 [c-lactone],
has been formed from B12 and the organochlorine antibacterial
agent chloramine T.10 Thus, food additives
that may inactivate B12 were screened for their ability
to change the UV–visible
absorption spectra of CN-B12. According to the results
of these preliminary experiments, hypochlorous acid water, sodium
metabisulfite, and sodium sulfite were selected. Hypochlorous acid
water is a highly safe antimicrobial agent and widely used as a food
additive.11−13 However, treatment with hypochlorous acid water (an
effective chlorine concentration of 30 ppm) resulted in immediate
and significant decreases of the absorption peaks at 278, 365, and
586 nm. Notably, these absorption maxima of CN-B12 completely
disappeared by 1 h (Figure 1A). This finding suggested the destruction of the corrin ring
and the liberation of the central cobalt ion of CN-B12 following
treatment with hypochlorous acid water. A high concentration of hypochlorous
acid reportedly induced the oxidative cleavage of the corrin ring
and the porphyrin ring, destroying these compounds.24,25 Although these observations suggest that the treatment of food with
hypochlorous acid water induces significant loss of B12, this agent did not affect the level of B12 in this study
(Figures 7 and 8). These results imply that hypochlorous acid water
could not react with food B12, which is present in its
protein-bound form in food.26,27 Hypochlorous acid is
generated by myeloperoxidase and plays an important role in the innate
immune system of mammals.28 Nevertheless,
it was suggested that highly generated hypochlorous acid leads to
various diseases due to the action of a potent oxidant protein and
induces chlorination and protein aggregation.25,29 This observation suggests that hypochlorous acid water as a food
additive adversely affects food proteins in foods, but not B12.

Through HPLC analysis, we detected five major peaks as degradation
products from B12 by HPLC analysis. Among them, we analyzed
three compounds eluted from the HPLC column at 10.9 (P-2), 12.3 (P-3),
and 17.1 min (P-6), respectively, using 1H NMR spectroscopy.
On the basis of the 1H NMR spectra, compounds P-2 and P-3
may be structural isomers, which lacked the olefinic proton at C10.
On the other hand, compound P-6 lacked the B7 proton on the dimethybenzoimidazole
ring instead of C10. Thus, the C10 position in the corrin ring appears
to be the first site of reaction with hypochlorous acid water. Compound
P-6 appears to be largely affected by treatment with hypochlorous
acid water versus compared to compounds P-2 and P-3. These degradation
products have not been detected in the oxidation process of B12. Determination of the chemical structures of these compounds
would lead to a better understanding of the degradation mechanism
of B12 by hypochlorous acid water.

When CN-B12 was treated with sodium metabisulfite or
sodium sulfite for 48 h, a small amount of sulfitocobalamin was formed.
Sulfitocobalamin was formed from glutathionylcobalamin, a product
formed by the decyanation reaction of CN-B12 in the presence
of reduced glutathione in mammalian cells.30,31 Sulfitocobalamin, which is one of the naturally occurring cobalamins
in foods, is biologically active in humans. However, it has been reported
that, in humans, the intestinal absorption of sulfitocobalamin was
lower than that of CN-B12.23

The results of this study indicate that these food additives
have
the ability to significantly change the properties of B12 in aqueous solution; however, they are unable to reduce the B12 content of food.
