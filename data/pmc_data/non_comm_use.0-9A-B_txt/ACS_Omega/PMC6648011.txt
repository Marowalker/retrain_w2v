Dielectric
metasurfaces can achieve flexible beam manipulations.
Herein, we study dielectric metasurfaces with different refractive
indices, periods, incident angles, and cross-sectional shapes to determine
the metasurface working mechanisms. Perfect transmission mainly depends
on multipolar interference that can be used to control the transmission
modes through the hybrid periods, hybrid cross sections, and multilayers.
Perfect reflection is strongly influenced by the period of the metasurface
and occurs only when the period is shorter than incident wavelength,
which can be attributed to the lattice coupling. Furthermore, lattice
coupling can be classified into two types with distinct properties:
vertical mode and horizontal mode coupling. The vertical mode appears
when the effective wavelength matches the feature size, whereas the
horizontal mode only appears when the incident wavelength is close
to the period. The horizontal mode is sensitive to the incident angle.
The revealed functioning mechanisms enable further practical applications
of metasurfaces.

1 Introduction
Metasurfaces have been
widely studied due to their abilities to
modulate the behaviors of electromagnetic waves. The rapid development
of metasurfaces has led to a number of applications, including nanoimaging,
surface-enhanced spectroscopy, highly efficient holograms, photovoltaics,
and quantum interferences in both linear and nonlinear regimes based
on wavefront shaping and beam manipulation.1−14 However, controversies regarding the origin of metasurfaces still
exist.10,15,16 Moreover,
in many metasurface applications, the design mainly depends on the
gradient structure, which can induce uneven phase distribution in
space and can thus achieve different functions.17−21 Recently, the frequency-dependent transmission-type
digital metasurface and low-profile planar coding antenna were proposed
and demonstrated to control transmission/radiation waves.22,23 Nevertheless, gradient metasurfaces require fine discretizations
of the structure to generate graded phase profiles, which makes it
difficult to fabricate them. Increasingly complicated structures have
been designed to manipulate optical beams with high efficiency.24−29 However, all these structures face similar manufacturing challenges.

To achieve flexible beam manipulation with high efficiency and
low requirements for advanced manufacturing technology, dielectric
metasurfaces utilizing multipolar interferences and diffractions are
exploited, which could provide a new platform for further development
of many branches of optics related to beam engineering.30−39 However, the basic physical mechanisms have not been clearly identified,
although many groups have made contributions to mechanism investigations.
Some researchers have focused on only the dipolar excitations and
have not established the links between multipolar interferences and
beam controls.35−38,40 Others have considered high-order
modes, such as electric quadrupole (EQ), electric octupole (EO), magnetic
quadrupole, and magnetic octupole, but have not indicated their exact
effects or working mechanisms for different phenomena.39,41−44 There exists a consensus that all demonstrated beam manipulations
can be simply attributed to the interaction between lattice coupling
and multipolar interference. However, how this interaction works and
how it affects metasurface properties remain to be studied. In this
paper, we numerically study the wave scattering of a one-dimensional
(1D) metasurface (or metalattice) consisting of dielectric cylinders
to detail the mechanisms and effects of lattice coupling and multipolar
interference on metasurface properties.

2 Simulation
Results and Discussions
Figure 1a displays
a schematic of the 1D metasurface consisting of periodic cylinders
(with radius R and refractive index n). The cylinders can have cross sections of different shapes, such
as a square or triangle (discussed later in this paper). The period
(P) is along the X direction. The
incident plane wave of the in-plane wavevector K (in
the X–Z plane: K⊥Y) can be s-polarized (TE mode, electric
field along Y direction: E0∥Y) or p-polarized (TM mode, magnetic field
along Y direction: H0∥Y). The plane wave has an incident angle
of Φ and free-space wavelength of λ.

Figure 1 Schematic of dielectric
grating with radius R and
period P (a). The incident waves propagate along
the direction of K with an incident angle of Φ.
Transmission properties of the metasurface with different periods:
(b) P = 2.8R, n = 2.6 (black solid line), n = 3.6 (blue dotted
line), and n = 4.6 (red dash-dotted line); and (c) P = 4R, n = 2.6 (black
solid line), n = 3.6 (blue dotted line), and n = 4.6 (red dash-dotted line).

First, we analyze the scattering properties, including the
perfect
transmission and perfect reflection, of a single metasurface with
p-polarized normally incident beam illumination. The transmission
properties of such a metasurface with different periods (P) are illustrated in Figure 1b,c. For P = 2.8R (Figure 1b), when the refractive
index (n) equals 2.6 (black line), the figure reveals
only one transmission peak and two reflection peaks in the wavelength
range investigated. When n increases to 3.6 (blue
dotted line), the figure reveals four transmission and four reflection
peaks, and all the peaks are red-shifted. When n further
increases to 4.6 (red dash-dotted line), the main transmission and
reflection peaks are similar to those of n = 3.6;
however, the positions of the corresponding peaks are shifted toward
long wavelengths. Concurrently, there occur increased fluctuations
in the short wavelength region. If the period (P)
increases to 4R (Figure 1c), the trend is consistent. All the peaks
are red-shifted with an increase in n. However, the
reflection band displayed in Figure 1b degenerates into two reflection peaks, which is useful
for wavelength-sensitive applications, and some new modes appear.
When n = 4.6 (red dash-dotted line), two reflection
peaks marked by red asterisks appear, one of which is the red shift
of the corresponding peak marked by a blue asterisk (n = 3.6), whereas the other peak is a new mode. The original single
mode can be considered to be split into two modes.

As displayed
in Figure 1b,c, for
metasurfaces with periods of 2.8R and 4R, the transmission or reflection peaks are
linearly red-shifted as the refractive index (n)
increases, which ensures that the effective wavelength remains unchanged
(Figure 2). The effective
wavelengths (λ/nR) at the transmission or reflection
peaks marked by the red dots (n = 4.6), blue dots
(n = 3.6), and black dots (n = 2.6)
in Figure 1b,c are
illustrated in Figure 2a,b, respectively. The transmission peaks T1 (black square
line) and T2 (blue triangle line) and the reflection peak
R1 (red circle line) associated with different refractive
indices (marked in Figure 1b) have an equal effective wavelength (Figure 2a). Similarly, the transmission peak T1 (black square line) and the reflection peaks R1 (red circle line) and R2 (blue triangle line) marked
in Figure 1c have an
equal effective wavelength (Figure 2b). Therefore, the main effect of increasing the refractive
index (n) is to increase the applicable wavelengths
of the metasurface.

Figure 2 Effective wavelength of the transmission (T) peaks and
reflection
(R) peaks marked in Figure 1b,c for different n: (a) P = 2.8R, T1 (black square line), T2 (blue triangle line), and R1 (red circle line)
and (b) P = 4R, T1 (black
square line), R1 (red circle line), and R2 (blue
triangle line).

Next, we examine the
effect of the period on transmission and reflection
properties. For p-polarized (TM) incident plane waves (Figure 3a,c), as the period becomes
larger, the perfect transmission peaks or perfect reflection peaks
degrade, especially in the short wavelength region. This phenomenon
occurs mainly because the optical field interaction between the cylinders
(lattice coupling) becomes weak when the wavelength is less than the
period. For example, for P = 4R (blue
dashed curve in Figure 3a), the two reflection peaks marked by the blue dashed circles in
the short wavelength range (λ < 4R) degenerate
compared with the situation when P = 2.8R (black solid curve). Concurrently, a new reflection mode marked
by a red dashed circle is generated at λ = 4.17R. The new reflection mode is derived from the horizontal mode, which
is discussed in the following text. The reflection band of P = 2.8R between λ = 6.5R and λ = 8R transforms into two reflection
peaks of P = 4R. When the period
further increases (Figure 3c), the perfect transmission peaks only exhibit marginal changes;
however, all the perfect reflection peaks in the range of λ
< P disappear. For example, when P = 5R (black solid curve in Figure 3c), all the perfect reflection peaks below
λ = 5R disappear, whereas when P = 7R (red dotted curve in Figure 3c), all the perfect reflection peaks below
λ = 7R disappear. Hence, there must exist different
mechanisms for the generation of transmission and reflection peaks.
The preliminary results indicate that reflection peaks depend mainly
on lattice coupling, and the metasurface can generate perfect reflection
peaks only when the incident wavelength is longer than its period.
By contrast, transmission peaks appear to be independent of lattice
coupling; however, these peaks are influenced by multipolar interference.

Figure 3 Transmission
properties of p-polarized (TM) and s-polarized (TE)
incident plane waves for different periods, where n = 3.6: (a) TM waves, P = 2.8R (black
solid curve) and P = 4R (blue dashed
curve); (b) TE waves, P = 2.8R (black
solid curve) and P = 4R (blue dashed
curve); (c) TM waves, P = 5R (black
solid curve) and P = 7R (red dotted
curve); and (d) TE waves, P = 5R (black solid curve) and P = 7R (red dotted curve).

For s-polarized (TE) incident waves (Figure 3b,d), the peaks in the short wavelength region
degrade when the period increases. Moreover, a new mode at λ
= 6.47R (marked by red dashed circle in Figure 3b) appears when P = 4R (blue dashed line in Figure 3b). This new mode is also derived
from the horizontal mode, as depicted in the inset of Figure 3b. For P =
5R (black solid curve in Figure 3d), no perfect reflection peaks exist below
λ = 5R, whereas for P = 7R (red dotted curve in Figure 3d), no perfect reflection peaks exist below
λ = 7R. The results obtained for TE waves are
similar to those obtained for TM waves. The characteristics of p-
and s-polarized incident waves are similar. Hence, we mainly focus
on p-polarized (TM) incident waves in the following text.

The
optical modes (patterns) at each transmission and reflection
peak associated with different periods are displayed in Figure 4. The optical patterns exhibit
little change with the period. In the long wavelength region, the
optical field is basically the single mode. As the wavelength moves
to the short wave direction, higher order modes begin to appear. The
distribution of most of these optical modes is basically the same
as that of a single cylinder (Figure 5). In Figure 5, four modes of the reflection peaks of P = 4R at λ = 4.17R, 4.70R, 6.3R, and 8.76R are
illustrated in the top row; the corresponding modes of a single cylinder
are displayed in the bottom row for comparison. At λ = 4.70R, 6.3R, and 8.76R, the
modes of the metasurface and single cylinder are identical. The modes
mainly depend on the relative size of the wavelength and cylinder
(called “vertical modes” because the optical field exhibits
a vertical distribution). The vertical modes in the cylinder appear
when the effective wavelength (λ/nR) in the
media matches the wavelength of the electric dipole, EQ, and EO. Shorter
wavelengths form higher order modes. Only the mode originating from
the periodicity (λ = 4.17R) is different. This
mode is transformed from a “vertical mode” to a “horizontal
mode” (the optical field is distributed in the horizontal direction).
Notably, no perfect reflection peaks are observed for the single cylinder.
However, the vertical mode distributions of the single cylinder are
similar to those of the metasurface, signifying that the perfect reflection
or transmission peaks of vertical modes cannot be distinguished from
optical field distributions. Moreover, the physical mechanisms of
the formation of perfect reflection peaks can be classified into two
types. The first type of mechanism does not change the vertical optical
mode distribution, whereas the other type changes the vertical mode
into the horizontal mode.

Figure 4 Optical patterns of light field distribution
in the cylinders at
each peak of different periods at n = 3.6 [black
solid line (P = 2.8R); blue dashed
line (P = 4R)]. The peak value is
indicated in the corresponding mode patterns.

Figure 5 Four modes of the reflection peaks of P = 4R when n = 3.6 at λ = 4.17R, 4.70R, 6.3R, and 8.76R (top row). The four modes at corresponding wavelengths
of the single cylinder (bottom row).

The reflection properties of the four peaks displayed in Figure 5 are investigated.
The reflection properties change dramatically as the incident angle
(Φ) increases (Figure 6a). In particular, the peak of λ = 4.17R (black solid line) is a perfect reflection point only when Φ
= 0°. When Φ = 2°, the reflection value of the peak
decreases sharply from 1 to nearly 0. Moreover, the horizontal mode
is transformed back into a vertical mode (illustrated in the inset
of Figure 6a), which
also demonstrates that the horizontal mode is completely different
from the vertical mode. As Φ increases, the other three perfect
reflection points of the vertical modes also degenerate but at lower
speeds than the peak of λ = 4.17R. For λ
= 8.76R (green dashed line), the reflection begins
to drop after Φ = 20°. Moreover, the reflection decreases
with some fluctuations, especially for λ = 4.7R (red dashed line) and λ = 6.3R (blue dotted
line).

Figure 6 Incident angles of optical waves (Φ) affect the (a) reflection
and (b) transmission properties at different peaks of P = 4R when n = 3.6.

Transmission peaks also degenerate as Φ increases;
however,
they degenerate at a considerably lower speed than do reflection peaks
(Figure 6b), which
demonstrates that the mechanism of transmission peaks is different
from that of reflection peaks. All the reflection peaks decrease in
magnitude before the incident angle reaches approximately 20°.
However, some transmission peaks begin to decline only when the incident
angle is higher than 60°, such as the peak at λ = 4.25R (red dashed line). For λ = 3.27R (black solid line), the transmission peak declines after Φ
= 10°; nevertheless, this peak again becomes a perfect transmission
peak when Φ increases to approximately 45°, and perfect
transmission is maintained until Φ > 60°, which is different
from the behavior of other peaks. The reason for the valley at Φ
= 24° is the formation of a similar horizontal mode (not perfect),
as displayed in the inset of Figure 6b. Here, the effective period changes to P cos Φ ≈ 3.6R, which is close to the
wavelength of λ = 3.27R, and the horizontal
mode transforms back very rapidly with a change in Φ. Therefore,
the horizontal mode forms when λ ≈ P and is sensitive to the light incident angle (Φ). This method
can be applied for some practical applications, including high-efficiency
tunable devices and antireflection.45,46

The
cross-sectional shape of the metasurface (square, trapezoidal,
or even triangular) can also affect its properties (Figure 7). The shape of the transmission
curve of the square section is similar to that of the transmission
curve of the cylindrical section, but the square section exhibits
a red shift (peaks marked by red dots; Figure 7a). All the peak values observed for the
trapezoidal (red dashed line in Figure 7b) and triangular cross sections (blue solid line in Figure 7b) have different
degrees of the blue shift and degradation compared with those observed
for the square cross section (black dotted line in Figure 7b).

Figure 7 Transmission properties
of different cross-sectional shapes at P = 4R when n = 3.6: (a)
circle (black dotted line) and square with a side length of 2R (red solid line) and (b) square (black dotted line), trapezoid
with a top and bottom length of R and 2R (red dashed line), respectively, and triangle with a side length
of 2R (blue solid line).

The up and down trapezoids and triangles have the same properties.
Therefore, the circular or square metasurface is suitable for perfect
transmission and reflection. The transmission and reflection peaks
of the square metasurface (marked by the red dots in Figure 7a) have similar properties
when the incident angle (Φ) changes, as displayed in Figure 8a,b, respectively.

Figure 8 Change
in the (a) transmission and (b) reflection characteristics
with the incident angle (Φ). The period of the square metasurface
is 4R, the side length of the square is 2R, and n = 3.6.

When λ = 4.67R (black solid line in Figure 8a, a transmission
valley occurs at Φ = 10° because of the horizontal mode,
as illustrated in the inset of Figure 8a. When λ = 6R (red dashed line
in Figure 8a), the
perfect transmission peak appears at Φ = 20° and not at
vertical incidence (Φ = 0°), which demonstrates that the
degenerated peaks at Φ = 0° may become the perfect transmission
peak again at some oblique incidence angles when the perfect multipolar
interference condition is satisfied. When λ = 11.3R (blue dotted line in Figure 8a), the transmission peak declines slowly, similar to the
decline for the cylindrical metasurface. The three reflection peaks
at λ = 5.1R (black solid line in Figure 8b), λ = 6.85R (red dashed line in Figure 8b), and λ = 9.2R (blue dotted line
in Figure 8b) exhibit
properties similar to those of the corresponding reflection peaks
of the cylindrical metasurface.

The advantage of the square
metasurface is that the processing
technology of the structure is relatively simple, which makes it more
practical than the other metasurfaces. We also determine the transmission
curve for a square surface structure on a dielectric film of n = 1.4 (Figure 9). The dielectric film does not change the shape of the transmission
curve; however, it weakens the transmission peaks and enhances the
reflection peaks. Hence, we can easily fabricate such a metasurface
on a dielectric film to obtain perfect reflections at a designed frequency.

Figure 9 Transmission
properties of a square metasurface (black dotted line)
and a square metasurface on a dielectric film of n = 1.4 (red solid line).

Metasurfaces with hybrid periods or hybrid cross sections
can generate
more transmission modes because they can meet more types of multipolar
interference conditions, compared with other metasurfaces. For example,
compared with a metasurface with a period of P =
4R (black solid line in Figure 10a, a metasurface with hybrid periods of P1 = 2.8R and P2 = 4R (displayed in the inset of Figure 10a) generates a
new transmission mode at λ = 8.34R (red dotted
line in Figure 10a).
The optical mode distribution around two cylinders of P1 is illustrated in the inset of Figure 10a, which displays a strong coupling interference
mode. If one of the two circular cylinders of P1 are changed to a square cylinder (inset of Figure 10b), we can obtain another
new transmission mode at λ = 7.06R (red solid
line in the inset in Figure 10b). According to the optical field distribution displayed
in the insets of Figure 10a,b, hybrid cross sections generate different multipolar interferences,
which cause new transmission modes.

Figure 10 Transmission properties of hybrid periods
and cross sections when n = 3.6: (a) circular metasurface
with a period of 4R (black solid line) and hybrid
periods of 2.8R and 4R (red dotted
line) and (b) circular metasurface
with hybrid periods of 2.8R and 4R (black dotted line) as well as hybrid circular and square metasurfaces
with hybrid periods of 2.8R and 4R (red solid line). The insets of Figure 10a,b illustrate the corresponding schematic
of the hybrid metasurface and the optical field distribution of the
new generated transmission modes, respectively.

Another method of generating a new transmission mode is to
use
two or more metasurface layers. Changing the distance (D) between the two cylindrical metasurface layers can increase the
order of the transmission mode (Figure 11). For example, when D =
2.8R (red dashed line), a new transmission mode appears
at λ = 8.4R. However, when the distance is
sufficiently large, such as when D = 5R (green dotted line), the interaction between the two layers can
be neglected, and the new mode disappears. No new perfect reflection
mode appears under these conditions, which demonstrates that perfect
reflection does not originate from multipolar interferences but from
lattice coupling.

Figure 11 Different distances between two cylindrical metasurface
layers.
For each metasurface layer, P = 4R and n = 3.6.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we investigate
the mechanisms of perfect transmission
and reflection in different metasurfaces. First, a change in the refractive
index mainly changes the working frequency range of the metasurface
through a change in the effective wavelength. Second, perfect reflections
are strongly influenced by the period of metasurfaces and occur only
when the period is less than the incident wavelength, which can be
attributed to the lattice coupling. Lattice coupling can be divided
into two types: vertical and horizontal mode coupling. The vertical
mode appears when the effective wavelength (λ/nR) matches the feature size, whereas the horizontal mode only appears
when the incident wavelength is close to the period. In particular,
the horizontal mode is very sensitive to the incident angle, and the
reflection peak can be changed into a transmission peak within 2°.
By contrast, transmission peaks appear to be independent of lattice
coupling because they basically remain unchanged as the period changes.
However, we can increase the transmission modes by using hybrid periods,
hybrid cross sections, or multilayers with different multipolar interferences.
Therefore, we can easily control and obtain the properties of metasurfaces
according to actual demands. Moreover, the properties of metasurfaces
with square cross sections are as good as those of cylindrical metasurfaces,
which can enable further practical applications of metasurfaces in
optical beam control.
