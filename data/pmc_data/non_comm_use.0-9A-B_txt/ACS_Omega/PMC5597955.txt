Studies on serotonin-selective
reuptake inhibitors have established that disturbances in the ascending
5-HT neuron systems and their 5-HT receptor subtypes and collateral
networks to the forebrain contribute to the etiology of major depression
and are targets for treatment. The therapeutic action of serotonin-selective
reuptake inhibitors is of proven effectiveness, but the mechanisms
underlying their effect are still unclear. There are many 5-HT subtypes
involved; some need to be blocked (e.g., 5-HT2A, 5-HT3, and 5-HT7),
whereas others need to be activated (e.g., postjunctional 5-HT1A and
5-HT4). These state-of-the-art developments are in line with the hypothesis
that the development of major depression can involve an imbalance
of the activity between different types of 5-HT isoreceptors. In the
current study, using in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA), we report
evidence for the existence of brain 5-HT1A–5-HT2A isoreceptor
complexes validated in cellular models with bioluminescence resonance
energy transfer (BRET2) assay. A high density of PLA-positive
clusters visualizing 5-HT1A–5-HT2A isoreceptor complexes
was demonstrated in the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1–CA3
regions of the dorsal hippocampus. A marked reduction in the density
of PLA-positive clusters was observed in the CA1 and CA2 regions 24
h after a forced swim test session, indicating the dynamics of this
5-HT isoreceptor complex. Using a bioinformatic approach, previous
work indicates that receptors forming heterodimers demonstrate triplet
amino acid homologies. The receptor interface of the 5-HT1A–5-HT2A
isoreceptor dimer was shown to contain the LLG and QNA protriplets
in the transmembrane and intracellular domain, respectively. The 5-HT2A
agonist TCB2 markedly reduced the affinity of the 5-HT1A agonist ipsapirone
for the 5-HT1A agonist binding sites in the frontal lobe using the
5-HT1A radioligand binding assay. This action was blocked by the 5-HT2A
antagonist ketanserin. It is proposed that the demonstrated 5-HT1A–5-HT2A isoreceptor complexes may play a role in depression through integration
of 5-HT recognition, signaling and trafficking in the plasma membrane
in two major 5-HT receptor subtypes known to be involved in depression.
Antagonistic allosteric receptor–receptor interactions appear
to be involved in this integrative process.

Introduction

A central role for serotonin 5-HT1A receptors was proposed in
the pathophysiology of depression and in the mechanism of action of
antidepressant drugs.1−6 Their activation inhibits neuronal firing in limbic
regions, which are hyperactive in depression.4 However, treatment with 5-HT1A agonists is complicated by the fact
that their activation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors inhibits the firing
of the ascending serotonin (5-HT) neurons and can contribute to depression
development.1,5 Chronic antidepressant treatment differentially
desensitizes 5-HT1A autoreceptors, explaining the delayed development
of antidepressant effects with SSRIs.1,4,5 For treatment of depression, it is therefore of interest
to develop 5-HT1A agonists selective for the postjunctional 5-HT1A
receptors,2,5 which seems possible in view of the differential
regional development of 5-HT1A homo- and heteroreceptor complexes
in forebrain versus midbrain raphe.6,7

A functional
brain analysis of the role of 5-HT in depression employed functional
magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography. 5-HT was found
to differentially regulate reward-predictive activities at different
time scales in the striatum–prefrontal cortex network.8 5-HT may adjust the rate of delayed reward discounting.
The existence was proposed of a parallel organization of reward prediction
at different time scales in the striatum, which is under the differential
modulation by 5-HT.9 This work may help
understand the role of 5-HT in the reward networks of the human brain,
but it is not known if the 5-HT1A receptor is involved in these actions
of 5-HT on the reward networks.

GALR1–5-HT1A heteroreceptor
complexes were found10 with allosteric
receptor–receptor interactions inhibiting 5-HT1A recognition
and an exaggerated activation of Gi/o-mediated signaling in 5-HT1AR.10−12 Galanin peptide (Gal (1–15))
given alone instead acts at GalR1–GalR2 heteroreceptor complexes
in the raphe-limbic 5-HT system to exert its strong depression-like
and anxiogenic effects.13 In contrast,
Gal (1–15) enhances the antidepressant effects in the forced
swim test (FST) induced by the 5-HT1AR agonist 8-OH-DPAT acting on
postjunctional and somatodendritic 5-HT1AR of the mesolimbic 5-HT
neurons.13 The results obtained suggest
the existence of GalR1–GalR2–5-HT1A heteroreceptor complexes14 in balance inter alia with GalR1–5-HT1A
complexes, where upon coactivation of the former with Gal1–15
and 5-HT1A agonists, differential allosteric receptor–receptor
interactions develop in the two regions, leading to antidepressant-like
actions.

The serotonin and neurotrophic factor hypotheses of
depression are recognized. The discovery of brain fibroblast growth
factor receptor 1 (FGFR1)–5-HT1A heteroreceptor complexes,
as well as their enhancement of neuroplasticity, allows an integration
of these two hypotheses.15 FGFR1–5-HT1A
heteroreceptor complexes were discovered in both the midbrain 5-HT
neurons and the hippocampus.15,16 Coactivation of FGFR1
and 5-HT1A protomers in the hippocampus may contribute to more rapid
and robust antidepressant actions. Prolonged combined agonist treatment
was postulated to counteract hippocampal atrophy in depression.

Six families of G protein-coupled 5-HT receptors exist, namely, 5-HT1,
5-HT2, 5-HT4, 5-HT5, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors.17 It is of high interest that 5-HT1A–5-HT7 heteroreceptor
complexes were found in 2012 in balance with 5-HT1A homodimers and
5-HT7 homodimers and the corresponding monomers.18 The 5-HT7 protomer upon agonist activation inhibits the
5-HT1A-mediated Gi/o signaling, which results in a reduction of the
ability of the 5-HT1A receptor protomer to activate GIRK channels.
The 5-HT7 protomer also enhances the internalization of the 5-HT1A
receptor protomer.18 It should be noted
that one of the triplet amino acid homologies in its interface is
used in the interface of the 5-HT1A–FGFR1 heteroreceptor complex.6 According to the triplet puzzle theory, such
homologies in the receptor interface will help guide the receptors
toward each other and facilitate the heterodimer formation.19

In the continuation of this search for
amino acid homologies in putative 5-HT1A isoreceptor complexes, they
were observed in putative 5-HT1A–5-HT2A isoreceptor complexes
(current study). In line with these results, it was found in 2004
that 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors are frequently coexpressed in pyramidal
cells of the prefrontal cortex.20 However,
a clear overlap between 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A immunoreactivities (IRs)
in the pyramidal cells remains to be established.21−23

In the current article, using in situ
proximity ligation assay (PLA), we report evidence for the existence
of brain 5-HT1A–5-HT2A isoreceptor complexes validated in
cellular models with bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET).
We also study their interface using the triplet puzzle theory19,24 and how it compares with the interface in other 5-HT isoreceptor
and heteroreceptor complexes.6,10,25,26 Antagonistic allosteric receptor–receptor
interactions in these isoreceptor complexes were established in the
frontal lobe, by which 5-HT2A agonist-induced activation of the 5-HT2A
protomer strongly reduced the affinity of the 5-HT1A agonist binding
sites of the 5-HT1A protomer. The current results open up a new molecular
mechanism for how the function of inhibitory 5-HT1A and excitatory
5-HT2A isoreceptors20,27,28 can
become integrated in the brain.

Combined
Results and Discussion
5-HT1A and 5-HT2A are two major 5-HT
receptor subtypes in the brain, with 5-HT1A having inhibitory actions
via Gi/o and 5-HT2A, excitatory actions via Gq/11.1,29 It
is therefore of high interest that in the current study it was possible
to demonstrate the existence of 5-HT1A–5-HT2A isoreceptor
complexes in the dorsal hippocampus and the anterior cingulate cortex
using in situ PLA assay.

In the dorsal hippocampus of untreated
Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats, a high density of PLA-positive clusters
(5-HT1A–5-HT2A isoreceptor complexes) was found in the pyramidal
cell layer of the CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions, whereas only a few were
found in the stratum oriens and radiatum of these areas, which was
similar to the background found in negative controls (Figure 1A). A single z-scan confocal
microscopy photograph with a higher magnification of the high density
of PLA-positive clusters is shown in the upper left part of Figure 1A. The quantitative
data are shown in Figure 1C as mean ± SEM (five rats/group). The columns in gray
are from the untreated rats and show the number of PLA clusters (blobs)
per nucleus per sampled field (30 × 30 μm2).
They range mainly from 10 to 15 PLA clusters in the CA1, CA2, and
CA3 regions and reflect the high density in the pyramidal cell layer.
There is only a low density of the PLA clusters in the granular cell
layer of the dentate gyrus (GCL).

isoreceptor complexes in the dorsal hippocampus of rat brain. (A)
Microphotographs of transverse sections of the rat dorsal hippocampus
(bregma level: −3.6 mm) showing the distribution of the 5-HT1A–5-HT2A
isoreceptor complexes in CA1 using the in situ PLA technique.15,31,39 They are shown as red PLA blobs
(clusters) found in high densities per cell in a large number of nerves
cells in the pyramidal cell layer using confocal laser microscopy.
No specific PLA blobs were found in the stratum moleculare and radiatum
of the CA1–CA3 regions. The nuclei are shown in blue by 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.
In the upper left part, the PLA blobs in the pyramidal cell layer
are shown in a higher magnification. In the lower right part, the
different parts of the dorsal hippocampus are shown in a transverse
section. The square outlines the CA1 area from which the picture was
taken. Abbreviations: CA1–3: region I–III of hippocampus

of the significant reduction of the density of PLA blobs in the CA1
subregion after the FST sessions (2 h) (B) vs unexposed controls (B).
(C) SD rats show a significant reduction in 5-HT1A–5-HT2A isoreceptor
complexes (PLA blobs) in CA3–CA1 subregions of the hippocampus
after the FST sessions. All animals were euthanized by a lethal dose
of pentobarbital (200 mg/kg) followed by formalin perfusion. PLA was
quantified as PLA per nucleus per sampled field by an experimenter
blind to treatment conditions. 5-HT1A–5-HT2A isoreceptor complexes
remain unchanged in SD rats after FST session in the granular cell
layer of the dentate gyrus (CGL) subregion of hippocampus (no significance,
mean ± SEM. Five rats per group, unpaired t-test).

mean ± SEM, five rats per group, unpaired t-test),
CA2 and CA1 subregions of the hippocampus (***p <
0.001, mean ± SEM, five rats per group, unpaired t-test). The number of PLA-positive cells in percent of the total
number of nuclei per sampled field did not change in any region (data
not shown). The 5-HT1A–5-HT2A isoreceptor complexes are stress
sensitive.

In the rats exposed to a FST
session 24 h earlier (Figure 1C, dark blue columns), a significant reduction in the density
of PLA-positive clusters was observed in the CA1 and CA2 regions,
whereas only a reduction was noted in the CA3 region (Figure 1C). No significant reduction
was observed in the granular cell layer. An example of the reduction
of the PLA clusters is given in the CA1 region (Figure 1B).

Double immunolabeling demonstrated
a partial colocalization of 5-HT1A immunoreactivity in red and 5-HT2A
immunoreactivity in green, as seen in Figure 2A–D. The
CA1 pyramidal cell layer is shown; by merging the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A
images, the partial colocalization is shown in yellow-orange around
the nerve cell bodies (Figure 2A). In higher-magnification images shown in Figure 2B, the arrows give examples
of the partial colocalization of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A IRs. In Figure 3C,D, images of 5-HT1A
and 5-HT2A IRs are also shown in the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1.
In these panels, colocalization is also indicated in putative dendrites,
as pointed out by the arrows.

hippocampus of rat brain. Microphotographs from transverse sections
of the rat dorsal hippocampus (bregma level: −3.6 mm) showing
the distribution of the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A IRs in CA1 pyramidal cell

is given. A high density of 5-HT1A (red) and 5-HT2A (in green) immunofluorescences
is observed in nerve cells using double immunolabeling. (A) The IRs
are shown to partially collocate (yellow-orange upon merging) within
the CA1 pyramidal cell layer. Orange demonstrates the partial collocation
of the two IRs in the surfaces of the pyramidal cells, indicated by
arrows in the high-magnification images in (B). It is also shown that
the two IRs can be partially collocated in putative dendrite processes
in the CA1 region located in the pyramidal cell layer and immediate
surrounding (C, D). CA stands for the latin cornus ammonis.

clusters in layers II and III from the anterior cingulate cortex.
Microphotographs from transverse sections of the rat anterior cingulate
cortex (bregma level: 1.2 mm) showing the distribution of the 5-HT1A–5-HT2A
isoreceptor complexes using the in situ PLA technique.15,31,39 They are shown as red PLA blobs
(clusters) found in high densities in layer III and in low to moderate
densities in layer II. Layer III represents the external pyramidal
cell layer in which large PLA-positive clusters are found and may
be located in the endoplasmatic reticulum of the pyramidal cells,
whereas the small circular clusters found may be located in the plasma
membrane. Layer II represents the external granular layer in which
mainly small circular clusters were found. High-magnification images
of these layers are shown in the right panels.

In
the anterior cingulate cortex (bregma level: 1.2 mm), a high density
of PLA-positive clusters (5-HT1A–5-HT2A isoreceptor complexes)
is found in layer III, and a low to moderate number of PLA clusters
in layer II are shown in low and high magnifications in Figure 3.

The findings were supported
by the demonstration of these complexes in cellular models using a
BRET2 saturation assay. A saturable and strong BRET2 signal was found in the HEK293T cells after cotransfection
with 5-HT1ARluc and 5-HT2AGFP2 (Figure 4A). BRET2 signaling demonstrated a hyperbolic function in response
to increasing amounts of transfected 5-HT2AGFP2, reaching
saturation at the highest concentrations obtained. The specificity
of the saturation obtained for the 5-HT1ARluc cells and 5-HT2AGFP2 pair was demonstrated because the
negative controls25 with coexpressing 5-HT1ARluc and ADA2CGFP2 receptors only
produced quasilinear curves (Figure 4A). The specificity was further supported by the demonstration
that BRET2 experiments on cells coexpressing TASR14GFP2 and 5-HT1ARluc receptors only
produced quasilinear curves as observed with the ADA2C receptor (data
not shown). The specificity is again shown by the observation that
FGFR1 unlike 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A also failed to compete with the formation
of the 5-HT1A–5-HT2A isoreceptor complex, as seen from a
nonreduced BRET2 ratio in competition experiments (Figure 4B). It is true that
FGFR1 can form heteroreceptor complexes with 5-HT1A.15,16,30 However, in a heterotrimer complex
of 5-HT1A–5-HT2A–FGFR1, FGFR1 may not interact with
the 5-HT1A–5-HT2A interface because the interface can be different.
Therefore, the 5-HT2A and FGFR1 may not compete with each other. In
addition, FGFR1 with a single transmembrane (TM) domain can have a
higher plasticity with regard to the interface interaction, leading
to an improved accommodation. Agonist and antagonists of the 5-HT1A
and 5-HT2A receptors did not modulate the BRET2 ratio (Figure 4C).

5-HT1A–5-HT2A isoreceptor complexes, and cells coexpressing
5-HT1ARluc and ADA2CGFP2 were used as negative
controls. Plotted on the X axis is the fluorescence
value obtained from the GFP2, normalized with the luminescence
value of 5-HT1ARluc expression 10 min after coelenterazine
incubation. The 5-HT1A–5-HT2A curve fitted better to a saturation
curve than to a linear regression, as found with the negative control

± SEM; n = 6 in triplicate. None of the ligands
tested produced a significant change in the BRET ratio signal, as
indicated by one-way ANOVA.

The selective
5-HT2A agonist TCB2 at 30 nM produced a marked shift to the right
in the competition curve obtained with the 5-HT1A receptor agonist
ipsapirone from [3H]-8-OH-DPAT binding sites (Figure 5A,C) in both areas
of the brain. A significant increase in the mean Ki value was obtained with TCB2 (five independent experiments),
demonstrating a reduction in the affinity of the high-affinity 5-HT1A
agonist binding sites by the 5-HT2A agonist in both regions. The specificity
is shown by the ability of the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin (1 μM)
to significantly block the action of TCB2 in frontal cortex membranes,
as indicated by statistical analysis using one-way ANOVA followed
by Tukey’s multiple comparison post test (*p < 0.05) (Figure 5D). In the case of hippocampus, there are also indications for antagonistic
effects of ketanserin (Figure 5B). It indicates the existence of inhibitory allosteric receptor–receptor
interactions in the 5-HT1A–5-HT2A isoreceptor complexes
by which agonist activation of the 5-HT2A protomer can reduce affinity
and thus recognition of the 5-HT1A protomer. Thus, the current study
strongly suggests that the existence of the 5-HT1A–5-HT2A isoreceptor
complexes, so far demonstrated in the anterior cingulate cortex and
in the hippocampus, allows a fine-tuned antagonistic modulation of
5-HT1A recognition and likely signaling through the 5-HT2A protomer.
It should be pointed out however that many 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors
are not colocated but can also operate independently of each other.

Figure 5 Modulation by serotonin
5-HT2A agonist TCB2 (30 nM) of
the 5-HT1A affinity is based on 3H-8-OH-DPAT/ipsipirone
competition experiments in membrane preparations from the hippocampus
(A, B) and frontal lobe (C, D). Thus, competition experiments involving
5-HT1A receptor agonist [3H]-8-OH-DPAT binding vs increasing
concentrations of ipsipirone were performed in hippocampus (A) and
frontal lobe (C) membranes in the presence or absence of the 5-HT2A
agonist TCB2 (30 nM) as indicated. Nonspecific binding was defined
as the binding in the presence of 200 μM serotonin. The curves
are based on the mean ± SEM of five rats, each one performed
in triplicate. The binding values are given in percent of specific
binding at the lowest concentration of ipsipirone employed. A histogram
of the Ki values (nM) obtained from the
competition curves is shown for both the hippocampus (B) and frontal
lobe (D). TCB2 (30 nM) produces a marked change in the reduction of
the Ki values (p <
0.05) in the hippocampus (B) and frontal lobe (D). This change in
the reduction of the Ki value is blocked
by ketanserin (1 μM) (p < 0.05) in membrane
preparation from the frontal lobe (D), one-way ANOVA followed by post
hoc Turkey’s multiple comparison test. In the hippocampus,
the ketanserin-treated group was not significant from control.

It should be noted that the stoichiometry and composition of the
5-HT1A–5-HT2A isoreceptor complexes are unknown. There could
exist a dynamic balance between dimeric, trimeric, tetrameric, and
even higher-order heteromeric receptor complexes and their associated
adapter proteins depending inter alia on the agonist activity at the
different receptors in the complexes.7,31 The G protein
signaling likely involves mainly 5-HT1A-mediated Galphai signaling
and 5-HT2A-mediated Galphaq signaling also in a dynamic balance with
each other through the allosteric receptor–receptor interactions
and the structure of the heteroreceptor complex and the degree of
coactivation. With changes in the allosteric mechanisms, the 5-HT1A
and 5-HT2A receptor protomers can develop diversity and bias in their
signaling through recruiting different types of G proteins and/or
other proteins like β-arrestin2. The current observations indicate
that activation of the 5-HT2A protomer reduces the affinity of the
5-HT1A protomer agonist binding site. It therefore seems likely that
an antagonistic allosteric receptor–receptor interaction may
exist in this receptor complex as well as in 5-HT1A protomer signaling
exerted by the 5-HT2A protomer upon its agonist activation.

In agreement with the demonstration of 5-HT1A–5-HT2A isoreceptor
complexes in the anterior cingulate cortex and the hippocampus, coexpression
of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A mRNAs were found in a high number of pyramidal
neurons of the rodent prefrontal cortex.20 There is no general agreement on the overlap of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A
imunoreactivities in the pyramidal cells, but a partial overlap seems
likely in the somatodendritic regions based on several publications21−23 in line with the current studies
in the hippocampus (Figure 2). It is proposed that in a large number of pyramidal nerve
cells there exist 5-HT1A homoreceptor complexes, 5-HT2A homoreceptor
complexes, and 5-HT1A–5-HT2A isoreceptor complexes, the
latter found in the overlap zones of the two IRs (Figure 1 and 2). The 5-HT nerve terminal
networks mainly operate via extrasynaptic volume transmission with
extracellular diffusion of 5-HT in the range of micrometers,23,32−34 reaching
inter alia different types of high-affinity 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A homo-
and isoreceptor complexes. On the basis of this view, there is
a highly dynamic decoding of the serotonin signal as the diffusing
serotonin in the micrometer range reaches a panorama of dynamic 5-HT
homo- and heteroreceptor complexes, in which the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A
protomers play a major role. The demonstrated 5-HT1A–5-HT2A
isoreceptor complexes make possible a fine-tuning of these two
major 5-HT isoreceptors already in the plasma membrane.

These
isoreceptor complexes may represent import targets for novel antidepressant
drugs. It was early found that some classical antidepressant drugs
can block certain types of 5-HT receptors35,36 now
known under the name of 5-HT2A receptors, which appear to enhance
depression.1 Instead, postjunctional 5-HT1A
receptors possess antidepressant activity.1 It therefore seems possible that a heterobivalent compound built
up of a 5-HT1A agonist pharmacophor linked to a 5-HT2A antagonist
pharacophor may specifically target the discovered 5-HT1A–5-HT2A
isoreceptor complex and be a novel type of antidepressant drugs.

In line with this view, it was demonstrated that acute exposure
to a FST session produced a marked reduction in the density of 5-HT1A–5-HT2A
isoreceptor complexes in the pyramidal cell layers in the dorsal
hippocampus. Thus, stress can acutely reduce their formation or increase
their internalization, which may lead to disturbances in the activity
of the pyramidal nerve cells and in their projections to cortical
areas and to the ventral striatum, with consequences for neuronal
networks involved in reward and antireward.

Previously, the
5-HT1A–5-HT7 isodimer was elegantly demonstrated.18 5-HT7 was shown to reduce the Gi signaling of
the 5-HT1A receptor protomer although enhancing 5-HT1A signaling over
the mitogen-activated protein kinase. An analysis of the 5-HT1A–5-HT2A
receptor interface using the triplet puzzle theory and comparison
with the interface of other 5-HT isoreceptor and heteroreceptor complexes
revealed four sets of protriplet amino acid homologies, namely, LLG,
TLG, QNA, and RNA (Figure 6). The receptor interface of the 5-HT1A–5-HT2A isoreceptor
dimer may operate via the LLG and QNA protriplets in the transmembrane
and the intracellular C-tail (5-HT1A) and ic1 (5-HT2A)) domains, respectively
(Figure 6). It is possible
that the 5-HT1A–5-HT7 isoreceptor dimer also may use the QNA
protriplet localized in the C-tail of both receptor protomers. The
other protriplet is TLG located in both receptor protomers in the
border zone between ic3 and TM6.

also present in the 5-HT1A–5-HT2A isoreceptor dimer (Figure 6). Instead, the 5-HT1A–FGFR1
heterodimer6 shows a TLG homology located
in intracellular domains also found in the 5-HT1A–5-HT7 isorecepor
dimer. A different type of isoreceptor dimer GalR1–GalR2 may
also use the RNA protriplet located in a similar position to that
found in GalR1 and again an LLG homology may be involved as in the
5-HT1A–5-HT2A isoreceptor dimer (Figure 6). The role of these protriplets in guiding
these receptor protomers toward each other19 is also indicated by the findings that the nonheterodimer 5-HT1A–ADRA2C25 lacked these four protriplet homologies.

Overall, a new 5-HT1A isoreceptor complex, composed of a 5-HT1A–5-HT2A
isomer, was found in cellular models and in the dorsal hippocampus
and the anterior cingulate cortex of the rat brain. Also, their receptor
interface may involve the QNA and LLG protriplet homologies. Antagonistic
allosteric receptor–receptor interactions likely exist in this
isoreceptor complex because a standard 5-HT2A agonist significantly
and markedly reduced the affinity of the 5-HT1A agonist binding sites.
Its dynamics was shown by the significant reduction of the PLA clusters
visualizing the 5-HT1A–5-HT2A complex in the dorsal hippocampus
upon exposure to FST sessions.

Material
and Methods
Reagents
[3H]-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin ([3H]-8-OH-DPAT) (141 Ci/mmole) was obtained from PerkinElmer.
Serotonin as well as other basic chemicals used in buffer preparation
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. 4-Bromo-3,6-dimethoxybenzocyclobuten-1-yl)methylamine
hydrobromide (TCB2), 8-OH-DPAT, ipsapirone, and ketanserin were purchased
from Tocris Cookson Inc. Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium, penicillin/streptomycin, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were
purchased from Invitrogen.

Animals
All experiments were performed using male SD rats (Scanbur, Sweden).
The rats were 3–4 months of age at the time of behavioral testing.
The animals were group-housed under standard laboratory conditions
(20–22 °C, 50–60% humidity). Food and water were
available ad libitum. For the behavioral testing, the rats were handled
for a minimum of 6 days before testing to minimize stress effects.
Each animal was used for one test only. To understand the dynamics
of the 5-HT1A–5-HT2A heteroreceptor complexes in the dorsal
hippocampus, the SD rats were exposed to a FST session37 2 h before decapitation and compared with a
control group (five rats/group). All studies involving animals were
performed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee
of the University of Málaga, the Stockholm North Committee
on Ethics of Animal Experimentation, the Swedish National Board for
Laboratory Animal, the Spanish Directive (Real Decretory 53/2013),
and the European Communities Council Directive (Cons 123/2006/3) guidelines
for accommodation and care of laboratory animals.

Plasmid Constructs, Cell Culture, and Transfection
The constructs presented herein were made using standard molecular
biology as described previously.10,26 HEK293T cells
were grown and transiently transfected as depicted in Borroto-Escuela
et al.15

Double-Immunolabeling Histochemistry
The experiments were
performed as described previously.38 Adult
age-matched male SD rats (n = 3) were anesthetized
and perfused intracardially with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in saline.
Brains were removed, postfixed by immersion overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and coronal sections (20 μm)
were cut on a cryostat and processed for free-floating immunohistochemistry.
The sections were permeabilized with buffer A containing 0.2% Triton
X-100 for 5 min and then preincubated in a blocking buffer containing
0.3% (w/v) triton and 4% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. After 1 h at
room temperature, the sections were labeled with the indicated primary
antibodies for 1 h, extensively washed, and stained with the indicated
fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies. The samples were rinsed
and visualized employing a Leica SP2 confocal microscope. The primary
antibodies used were as follows: mouse monoclonal anti-5-HT1A (1 μg/mL,
Millipore, Stockholm, Sweden) and rabbit monoclonal anti-5-HT2A (SAB4301791,
1 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, Stockholm, Sweden). The secondary antibodies
used were Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat antimouse IgG (1:2000; Invitrogen,
Stockholm, Sweden) and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat antirabbit
IgG (1:2000; Invitrogen, Stockholm, Sweden).

In Situ PLA
To study the 5-HT1A–5-HT2A isoreceptor
complexes, the in situ PLA was performed as described previously.15,16,31,39 Free-floating
formalin-fixed brain sections (30 μm) at a bregma level of −3.6
mm from untreated SD rats were employed using the following primary
antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-5-HT1A (1 μg/mL, Millipore,
Stockholm, Sweden) and rabbit monoclonal anti-5-HT2A (SAB4301791,
1 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, Stockholm, Sweden). Control experiments
employed only one primary antibody or cells transfected with cDNAs
encoding only one type of receptor. The PLA signal was visualized
and quantified using a Leica TCS–SL confocal microscope (Leica)
and the Duolink ImageTool software. Briefly, fixed free-floating rat
brain sections (storage at −20 °C in Hoffman solution)
were washed four times with PBS and quenched with 10 mM glycine buffer
for 20 min at room temperature. Then, after three PBS washes, incubation
took place with a permeabilization buffer (10% FBS and 0.5% Triton
X-100 or Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4) for 30 min at room
temperature. Again, the sections were washed twice, 5 min each, with
PBS at room temperature and incubated with the blocking buffer (0.2%
BSA in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. The brain sections were
then incubated with the primary antibodies diluted in a suitable concentration
in the blocking solution for 1–2 h at 37 °C or at 4 °C
overnight. The day after, the sections were washed twice and the proximity
probe mixture was applied to the sample and incubated for 1 h at 37
°C in a humidity chamber. The unbound proximity probes were removed
by washing the slides twice, 5 min each, with the blocking solution
at room temperature under gentle agitation, and the sections were
incubated with the hybridization–ligation solution (BSA (250
g/mL), T4 DNA ligase (final concentration, 0.05 U/μL), Tween
20 (0.05%), NaCl (250 mM), adenosine 5′-triphosphate (1 mM),
and the circularization or connector oligonucleotides (125–250
nM)) and incubated in a humidity chamber at 37 °C for 30 min. The
excess of connector oligonucleotides was removed by washing twice,
5 min each, with the washing buffer A (Sigma-Aldrich; Duolink Buffer
A (8.8 g of NaCl, 1.2 g of Tris base, and 0.5 mL of Tween 20 dissolved
in 800 mL of high-purity water at pH 7.4) at room temperature under
gentle agitation, and the rolling circle amplification mixture was
added to the slices and incubated in a humidity chamber for 100 min
at 37 °C. Then, the sections were incubated with the detection
solution in a humidity chamber at 37 °C for 30 min. In
a last step, the sections were washed twice in the dark, 10 min each,
with the washing buffer B (Sigma-Aldrich; Duolink Buffer B (5.84 g
of NaCl, 4.24 g of Tris base, 26.0 g of Tris–HCl dissolved
in 500 mL of high-purity water at pH 7.5) at room temperature under
gentle agitation. The free-floating sections were put on a microscope
slide, and a drop of appropriate mounting medium (e.g., VectaShield
or Dako) was applied. The coverslip was placed on the section and
sealed with nail polish. The sections were protected against light
and stored for several days at −20 °C before confocal
microscope analysis.

BRET2 Saturation Assay
The BRET2 saturation experiment
was performed as described previously.40,41 HEK293T cells,
48 h after transfection, transiently transfected with constant (1
μg) or increasing amounts (0.12–5 μg) of plasmids
encoding for 5-HT1ARluc and 5-HT2AGFP2, respectively, were rapidly washed twice in PBS, detached,
and resuspended in the same buffer. Cell suspensions (20 μg
protein) were put in duplicates into the 96-well microplate black
plates with a transparent bottom (Corning 3651) (Corning, Stockholm,
Sweden) for fluorescence measurement or white plates with a white
bottom (Corning 3600) for BRET determination. For BRET2 measurements, coelenterazine 400a also called DeepBlueC substrate (VWR, Sweden) was used at a final concentration of 5
μM. The readings were made 1 min after using the POLARstar Optima
plate reader (BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany) that allows the sequential
integration of the signals observed with two filter settings [410
nm (80 nm bandwidth) and 515 nm (30 nm bandwidth)]. The BRET2 ratio is defined as previously described by Borroto-Escuela et al.42

5-HT1A Radioligand
Binding Assay
Membrane Preparation
Frozen frontal lobe and hippocampus tissue was homogenized with
an Ultra-Turrax in 5 mL of ice-cold preparation buffer containing
50 mM Tris–HCl/Tris base and 2.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (pH 7.4). The membranes were precipitated by centrifugation at
20 000 rpm and 4 °C for 10 min. The resulting pellet was
resuspended in the same volume of preparation buffer, preincubated
at 37 °C for 10 min, and centrifuged at 20 000 rpm and
4 °C for 10 min three times. The final pellet was resuspended
in preparation buffer and sonicated for 10 s (Soniprep 150, U.K.),
and the total protein concentration of homogenates was determined
by BCA Protein Assay (Pierce, Sweden). Membranes were prepared on
the day of radioligand binding assay.

5-HT1A Receptor Binding
Competition binding experiments
for the 5-HT1A receptor were performed with the 5-HT1A agonist (ipsapirone,
12 concentrations from 0.01 nM to 100 μM (TOCRIS, catalog 1869,
batch 2) using a 96-well microplate with GF/B filter (UniFilter GF/B,
PerkinElmer), and a 1 nM concentration of [3H]-8-OH-DPAT.
The modulation of the 5-HT1A competition curve by the 5-HT2A agonist
TCB2 was tested at a concentration of 30 nM in view of its Ki value around 10 nM.26 The assay mixture (total volume, 300 μL) contained the membrane
suspension (120 μg of protein per reaction), [3H]-8-OH-DPAT
in the buffer containing 50 mM Tris–HCl, 10 μM pargyline,
4 mM CaCl2, and 0.1% ascorbic acid. For nonspecific binding,
200 μM serotonin was used. The reaction mixture was incubated
at room temperature for 60 min with gentle shaking. The binding was
terminated by a rapid filtration, followed by three washes with 200
μL of cold washing buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4). The
filters were dried and immersed in 2 mL of scintillation liquid (Ultima
Gold MV, PerkinElmer). The bound ligand was determined by WALLAC 1409
DSA liquid scintillation counter. The results were calculated in GraphPad
Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software Inc.).

Bioinformatic Analysis
Using a bioinformatics approach,
indications were obtained that receptors forming heterodimers demonstrated
triplet amino acid homologies. This was not true for pairs of receptors
that fail to form heterodimers.19 These
triplet homologies can therefore participate in the receptor interface
and give a code that helps the formation of the heterodimer. It was
called the triplet puzzle theory.19,43 The 5-HT1A–5-HT2A
isodimer will be analyzed with this mathematical approach in the
current study and compared with other 5-HT isoreceptor and heteroreceptor
complexes. The compiled data for the bioinformatic analysis was obtained from the GPCR Hetnet database (www.gpcr-hetnet.com).25

Statistical
Analysis
The number of samples (n) under
each experimental condition is indicated in figure legends. Data from
competition experiments were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis
using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA).
The inhibition constants of the high- and low-affinity states of the
receptor (pKiH and pKiL, respectively) from several independent replications
were averaged allowing statistical comparisons using a one-way ANOVA.
Group differences after ANOVAs were measured by post hoc Turkey’s
multiple comparison test. A p value of 0.05 and lower
was considered significant. BRET2 isotherms were fitted
using a nonlinear regression equation assuming a single binding site,
which provided BRETmax and BRET50 values.
