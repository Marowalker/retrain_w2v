This research suggests
a green method for synthesizing hybrid magnetic
nanocomposites that can be used as a reductant and a stabilizing agent
for immobilizing metal nanoparticles (NPs). The central idea is the modification of magnetic
NPs using Rubia tinctorum extract,
which consists of numerous carbonyl and phenolic hydroxyl functional
groups to increase adsorption of metals and chelate silver ions, and
decrease the adsorption of silver ions by Ag NPs, in situ. Thus, the
suggested catalyst preparation process does not require toxic reagents,
additional reductants, and intricate instruments. To show the effectiveness
of the plant extract in reducing and immobilizing Ag NPs, the structural,
morphological, and physicochemical features of the particles are studied
using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, inductively coupled
plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy,
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy, vibrating sample magnetometry, X-ray diffraction
analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. One of the advantages
of the suggested method is to reduce the size of the magnetic NPs
from 15–20 to 2–5 nm, in the presence of the extract.
Additionally, the prepared Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag nanocatalyst is demonstrated to exhibit
a very high activity in the catalysis of the three-component reaction
of aldehydes, amines, and alkynes (A3 coupling) with good
to high yields of diverse propargylamines. Moreover, the nanocatalyst
can be recovered several times with no considerable leaching or loss
of performance.

Introduction
Propargylamines (PPAs) play many main
roles in the area of organic
chemistry. They can be utilized as the precursors and building units
of numerous nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds; meanwhile,
they can also be used as the key intermediates in synthesizing bioactive
medicines and natural products.1 Furthermore,
numerous PPAs can cure neuropsychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer’s
and Parkinson’s diseases.2 Owing
to the importance of PPAs, diverse methods, for example, A3 coupling reaction, have been improved for their preparation.3 Among all suggested PPA synthesis approaches,
the A3 coupling method is considered as the most efficient
and direct method. In this technique, a homogeneous or heterogeneous
transition-metal catalyst is used for coupling the three reaction
components, that is, an amine, an aldehyde, and a terminal alkyne.4 In recent years, diverse homogeneous and heterogeneous
catalysts have been applied to synthesize PPA via A3-coupling
reaction based on transition metals containing Zr4+,5 Mn2+,6 Re1+,7 Fe2+,8 Ru3+,9 Co2+,10 Ir1+,11 Ni2+,12 Pd2+,13 Cu2+,14 Ag1+,15 Au0,16 Zn2+,17 Cd2+,18 and Hg2+.19 The used transition-metal
catalysts can be in the form of nanoparticles (NPs) resulting in a
great surface-to-volume ratio, excellent selectivity, and good activity
for the coupling reaction.20,21

The NPs can be
a more attractive option if they are magnetic as
magnetic NPs (MNPs) ease elimination and recovery of nanocatalysts
from reaction mixtures.22 Diverse core-/shell-structured
MNPs have been applied to reduce the cost of catalyzed reactions.23−28 However, Fe3O4-based core/shell NPs have been
the most extensively used nanocatalysts because of their ease in magnetic
separation and noticeable catalytic activity. Importantly, Fe3O4 systems can be functionalized with numerous
functional groups for carrying noble metals. In this regard, polymers
are a suitable option as they can tolerate a large number of functional
groups in their chains for presenting excellent compatibility with
the interest metals. The other benefit of anchoring polymers on Fe3O4 MNPs is that the existence of the polymers avoids
accumulation of the magnetic core/shell structures, which is a common
issue in preparing Fe3O4 core/shell nanocatalysts.
For this reason, numerous studies have emphasized on the encapsulation
of Fe3O4 NPs by diverse polymers. Several examples
of the reported Fe3O4–polymer composites
are Fe3O4@polypyrrole, Fe3O4@polyaniline, and Fe3O4@polydoapmine, which
have shown excellent catalytic potential.29−32

As stated, polymer–iron
oxide composites have the ability
to carry noble metals. The metal which is of interest in the current
research is silver. So far, numerous investigations have reported
the synthesis of Ag NPs for different purposes. As an example, Ag
NPs have been used as extremely active surface-enhanced Raman scattering
substrates,33 electrochemical and biosensors,34,35 antibacterial coatings,36 and extremely
effective catalysts of organic reactions.37 As catalysts, Ag NPs have been used in oxidation of phenylsilanes,
alcohol dehydrogenation, Diels–Alder cycloadditions, and reduction
of aromatic compounds.38−40 Although the inadequacy of Ag NPs is that their surface
atoms destabilize over reactions. Opportunely, immobilization of the
Ag NPs onto supports can overcome this problem.41,42 In the current research, the support material is polymer-immobilized
MNPs because of their various advantages. As mentioned above, one
of the key advantages of using MNPs is that their supermagnetic and
insoluble features allow the isolation of MNP-supported noble metals
from reaction mixtures by means of an appropriate magnet and with
no need of filtration or centrifugation. Moreover, immobilizing Ag
NPs onto the surface of polymer–Fe3O4 particles develops dispersing Ag NPs and their ability to promote
biological separation, biological targeting, catalysis, high-density
magnetic recording, and targeting treatment.43

Regarding the wide variety of Ag–Fe3O4 applications, numerous approaches have been developed for
their
preparation. Zhang et al. studied the one-pot water-phase preparation
of Ag–Fe3O4 MNPs with the FeCl3 and AgNO3 metal precursors and the ethylene glycol reductant.44 Using the same technique, Zhu et al. synthesized
Ag–Fe3O4 MNPs in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone.45 Chen et al. used a solvothermal technique to
attain Ag/Fe3O4 nanowires. In their research,
a polyol synthesis method was used to prepare Ag nanowires and Fe3O4 particles were coated on the wires via the solvothermal
technique.46 Lopes et al. prepared Ag–Fe3O4 colloidal dimer NPs via a two-step chemical
technique. First, they synthesized Ag NPs by heating a phenyl-ether
solution of oleyamine, oleic acid, and C54H45NO3P3Ag at a temperature of 250 °C. Then,
the obtained phenyl-ether mixture containing colloidal Ag NPs, Fe(acac)3, oleic acid, 1,2-hexadecanediol, and oleyamine was heated
to obtain heterodimer Ag–Fe3O4 NPs.47 Li et al. utilized an electroless silver plating
method to synthesize Ag/Fe3O4 MNPs via bringing
a solution of AgNO3 and formaldehyde (methanal) in contact
with Fe3O4 NPs.48 The point is that these introduced preparation methods have numerous
disadvantages such as operation at high temperatures and pressures,
comprising complex chemical preparation, and using expensive surfactants.
Consequently, these approaches should be substituted with an alternative
simple, fast, and low-cost method, such as plant-mediated NP preparation.
This biosynthesis method is a cost-effective and single-step method
that needs nontoxic reagents and environmental friendly solvents.
Accordingly, this technique is safe for humans and the environs.49−55

In the current study, the Rubia tinctorum plant (Figure 1)
is selected for biosynthesizing the MNPs. This plant belongs to the
Rubiaceae family, which has 6000 species and 500 genera,56 and is named “madder” in English
and “ronas” in Persian.57 Over all, this plant has been originated from Caucasus and Near
East; however, it is cultivated in the north of Africa, the Mediterranean
regions from Spain to Asia, and, moreover, in some regions of Asia.
In Iran, it is planted in some central and western regions, for example,
Yazd.58 This plant comprises numerous anthraquinones
containing rubiadin, purpurin, lucidin, and alizarin.59−63

Today, ecological concerns have encouraged chemists to shift toward
green chemistry.64 Therefore, recoverable
heterogeneous catalysts can involve in eliminating or reducing chemical
wastes, mainly in the case of large-scale and industrial processes.65 Regarding the outlined topics and in continuation
of our research in this area,66 this research
emphasizes on preparation of PPAs through A3 coupling of
amines, aldehydes, and alkynes, from a green perspective. The suggested
synthetic method is catalyzed by the Ag NPs supported on the ultrafine
surface-modified Fe3O4 MNPs. In this technique,
the R. tinctorum extract is used as
a stabilizer and a reductant agent that modifies the surface of the
magnetic Fe3O4 NPs. The key advantage of the
used Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag nanocomposite is that it can be recovered and reused several
runs with no remarkable loss of performance.

Results and Discussion
The current research emphasizes on a green and environmental friendly
technique that uses a plant extract to modify MNPs for fabricating
a novel adsorbent for adsorbing metal ions and reducing them to stabilized
metal NPs. The used extract is the R. tinctorum extract, which can deposit Ag+ ions onto the Fe3O4 MNPs surface, reduce the ions to Ag NPs, and stabilize
the reduced particles effectively. It is worth noting that the biomolecules
of R. tinctorum have a significant
tenacity against accumulation of the Fe3O4 MNPs,
besides reducing silver salts strongly. Moreover, the phenolic compounds
of the R. tinctorum extract consist
of hydroxyl and ketonic groups that can connect to metals and show
chelating impact. In the current research, the NPs of Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag were
prepared via the two-stage modification of iron oxide (Fe3O4) MNPs using the R. tinctorum extract and, then, adsorbing Ag+ ions onto the modified
MNPs and reducing and stabilizing the adsorbed ions by the extract.
One of the benefits of this preparation method is reducing the dimension
of the MNPs from 15–20 to 2–5 nm, as the adsorbed extract
can reduce and stabilize the adsorbed Ag+ ions to Ag NPs,
in situ (Scheme 1).
After preparation of the Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag MNPs, the particles were collected
using an external magnet. Atomic absorption spectroscopy showed that
the Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag nanocomposite comprises 0.105 mmol g–1 of silver.
The structure of the nanocatalyst was characterized using diverse
analytical methods of X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, inductively coupled
plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), and Fourier-transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy.

Nanocatalyst
FT-IR spectroscopy
was performed to assess the variations in the
structure of the Fe3O4 NPs upon modifying with
the extract and formation of Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag. Figure 2 shows the FT-IR spectra corresponding to
the Fe3O4 NPs, the R. tinctorum extract, the Fe3O4@R. tinctorum MNPs, and the Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag nanocomposite. On the basis of Figure 2a, the FT-IR spectrum corresponding to the
Fe3O4 NPs shows two broad peaks at 1615 and
3423 cm–1 corresponding to the adsorbed water molecules
and the OH groups; however, the bands observed at 439 and 581 cm–1 are associated with the bending and stretching vibrations
of the Fe–O function group, respectively, and the band at 629
cm–1 confirms the presence of a pure Fe3O4 structure. On the other hand, the FT-IR spectrum corresponding
to the aqueous R. tinctorum extract
(Figure 2b) shows the
3424 (OH), 2924 (C–H), 1718 (CO), 1636 (C=C), 1285 (C–O),
1054 (C–O–C), and 815 cm–1 (O–H)
vibrational modes that are related to polyols, carbonyls, and C=C
bonds and propose the existence of flavonoids and terpenoids in the
extract. When the Fe3O4 NPs are functionalized
by the extract, that is, the Fe3O4@R. tinctorum NPs, the related FT-IR spectrum (Figure 2c) is accompanied
with several new vibrational bands that are not found in Figure 1a,b. These bands
are directly resulted by coating the NPs with the extract’s
compounds and appeared at 1723 and 1087 cm–1 corresponding
to the stretching vibrations of the C=O and C–O bonds,
respectively,67 and the bands appeared
at 2924 and 2887 cm–1 rising from the C–H
stretching vibrations.68 Moreover, numerous
bands have been observed at 1400–1600 cm–1 that are ascribed to the stretching vibrations of C=C bonds
in aromatics rings.69 These bands show
that the hydrophilic nature of the modified NP surface because of
the effective coating of the R. tinctorum extract on the Fe3O4 NPs surface. Finally,
the FT-IR spectrum corresponding to the Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag NPs (Figure 2d) is the same as that of the
Fe3O4@R. tinctorum NPs. However, as it can be observed, the 1087 cm–1 band of the C–O stretching vibration is moved to 1084 cm–1, the C=C stretching band is shifted from 1633
to 1625 cm–1, and the O–H stretching band
is moved from 3425 to 3420 cm–1. These shifts show
that the extract components are chemically bonded to the Ag NPs on
the MNP surface. According to the achieved spectra, the hydroxyl functional
groups corresponding to the flavonoids and other phenolic compounds
of the extract are the active moieties that cause reduction of the
adsorbed Ag+ ions to Ag0 and stabilization of
the Ag NPs. Actually, because of the antioxidant nature of flavonoids
and phenolic compounds, donating an electron (accompanied with a hydrogen
nucleus) from the OH groups of the phenolic rings should be involved
in reducing Ag+ ions to Ag0.70

NPs.

The shape, distribution of size,
surface morphology, and major
physical features of the produced particles were assessed using FESEM.
Because the FESEM images of the Fe3O4 and Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag
MNPs (Figure 3) show
that the Fe3O4 particle size in the Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag MNPs
is smaller compared to the initial Fe3O4 particles
while both specimens consist quasi-spherical NPs, it is obvious that
coating Fe3O4 NPs with the extract causes a
significant decrease in its particle size. Furthermore, the considerable
difference between the Ag NPs and the iron oxide particles in Figure 3b shows that the
Ag+ ions have been effectively decreased in situ for immobilizing
Ag NPs onto the Fe3O4@R. tinctorum NP surface. Furthermore, the FESEM images display that both the
Ag and iron oxide NPs have crystalline structures with dimension ranging
in 20–40 and 2–5 nm, respectively.

NPs.

Figure 4 demonstrates
the elemental composition corresponding to the magnetic samples. According
to the achieved EDX outcomes, silver species are dispersed on the
extract shell homogeneously and the Fe3O4 NPs
have been fully coated with the extract. Furthermore, the Fe, C, N,
S, O, and Ag elements are in the Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag nanocatalyst. The S signal that represents
the alizarin molecules of the R. tinctorum extract approves effective modification of the Fe3O4 NPs using the extract while the presence of the Ag signal
confirms successful functionalization of Ag NPs and synthesis of the
desired Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag NPs. Also, its elemental maps are displayed in Figure 5, which confirmed the well-dispersed
Ag NPs in the sample.

Corresponding elemental mapping of Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag NPs, Fe, C,
and Ag, respectively (scale bar is 500 nm).

Moreover, the morphology of the as-prepared NPs was analyzed using
HRTEM. Comparing the HRTEM images corresponding to the Fe3O4 (Figure 6a), Fe3O4@R. tinctorum (Figure 6b), and
Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag (Figure 6c) NPs
unravels that the spherical Fe3O4 cores of the
Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag and Fe3O4@R. tinctorum MNPs are very smaller compared to the initial Fe3O4 particles and the magnetic cores are well distributed following
coating them with the biocomponents of the R. tinctorum extract. It seems that the appeared thin layer of biomolecules on
the Fe3O4@R. tinctorum particles is responsible for reduction and stabilization of silver
on the magnetic support. Moreover, comparison of Figure 6b and c shows the existence
of the functionalized Ag NPs on the Fe3O4 MNP
surface and proposes that the Ag NPs are almost 20–40 nm in
scale within a narrow size distribution. The agreement of the HRTEM
and FESEM outcomes leaves no doubt about the ability of the R. tinctorum layer of Fe3O4@R. tinctorum in reduction and deposition
of Ag NPs with an excellent particle distribution on the MNPs surface. Figure 6d shows the HRTEM
image corresponding to the Ag NPs at 5 nm magnification. On the basis
of Figure 6d, the Ag
NPs include lattice fringes, which confirm the excellent crystallinity
of these NPs. Meanwhile, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) image corresponding
to the Ag NPs (Figure 6e) shows bright diffraction spots and ring patterns that signify
the crystalline structure of the Ag atoms on the surface of Fe3O4@R. tinctorum.

Ag NPs corresponding to image of (d) (e).

Besides confirming the deposition of Ag NPs onto the Fe3O4@R. tinctorum surface
using the FESEM and HRTEM methods, the nanocatalyst was studied using
XRD analysis to additionally approve the coated particles and unravel
their crystal features. The obtained XRD patterns corresponding to
the Fe3O4 and Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag NPs are shown in Figure 7. The (220), (311), (400),
(422), (511), and (440) crystal planes of the Fe3O4 NPs indicate the cubic structures of Fe3O4 MNPs (JCPDS no. 19-0629). However, these crystal planes also
appeared in the XRD pattern corresponding to Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag; the additional bands
observed at 38.2° (111), 44.3° (200), 64.5° (220),
and 78.2° (311) show that the cubic magnetite crystals are combined
with face-centered cubic silver crystals (JCPDS no. 87-720). This
evidence approves effective synthesis of the Ag NPs on the surface
of Fe3O4@R. tinctorum MNPs. The last point of the crystal structures of the synthesized
NPs is that the surface functionalization and silver deposition procedures
are unsuccessful on the crystal structure of the Fe3O4 NPs. Thus, the specific XRD bands of the pristine Fe3O4 NPs also appear in the XRD pattern corresponding
to the Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag NPs.

nanocomposites.

The electronic features of the
surface species of the MNPs containing
their oxidation states, electron environs, and binding energies (BEs)
were examined using XPS. Figures 8 and 9 show the XPS elemental
scans for the Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag nanocatalyst. In agreement with the EDX outcomes, the XPS spectra
show the existence of oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, silver, and iron.
Moreover, the XPS outcomes show an intense doublet at the 374.33 and
368.32 eV BEs, which imply the Ag 3d3/2 and Ag 3d5/2 bands, respectively. The XPS outcomes show the presence of reduced
Ag(0) species and exclude the possibility of +1 oxidation state for
the coated Ag NPs. The well reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0) approves the
efficiency of the R. tinctorum layer.71

Ag 3d regions.

Figure 9 Wide scan XPS spectrum of Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag and in the
Fe 2p and C 1s regions.

In Figure 9, the
characteristic bands of carbon (C 1s) and iron (Fe 2p) are obvious,
which shows that the R. tinctorum extract
is effectively deposited on the iron oxide MNPs. The XPS spectrum
corresponding to Fe 2p displays two key bands that are associated
with Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 and can be deconvoluted
to the 712.4, 715.8, 719.3, 726.5, 729.8, and 733.4 eV bands. Four
of these bands refer to Fe2+ (712.4 and 726.5 eV) and Fe3+ (715.8 and 729.8 eV) in the Fe3O4 phase
while the two satellite bands (719.3 and 733.4 eV) relate with Fe3+ in the Fe2O3 phase. In other words,
the study of the oxidation states points to the presence of few γ-Fe2O3 particles.72−74 Finally, fitting of
the C 1s XPS spectra corresponding to the Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag nanocatalyst shows
nonoxygenated carbon at 285.2 eV, carbon in C–OH/C–O–C
at 288.2 eV, carbon in C=O at 289.2 eV, and the O–C=O
group at 292.7 eV. Also, the UV analysis of the Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag NPs is demonstrated
in Figure 10a. The
peak absorption at 418 nm related to Ag NPs, which confirmed the presence
of Ag NPs in the Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag NP nanocamposite.

Figure 10 UV–vis spectrum of Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag NPs (a) and
VSM of (a) Fe3O4 and (b) Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag NPs.

As the final characterization stage, the magnetic
features of the
prepared Fe3O4 and Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag NPs were examined
with VSM. On the basis of Figure 10b, both of the Fe3O4 and Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag
samples show a usual superparamagnetic activity with almost zero remanence
and coercivity. Furthermore, the VSM outcomes indicate that adding R. tinctorum extract and Ag layers reduces the saturation
magnetization (Ms) of the Fe3O4 NPs. However, the Ms value
for Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag (40.3 emu/g) is significantly smaller compared with that of the
Fe3O4 NPs (62.4 emu/g), and the magnetic sensitivity
of the Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag is adequate for its magnetic recovery from diverse reaction mixtures.
Consequently, the prepared nanocomposite has the ability to act as
a magnetically recoverable nanocatalyst.

Once the Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag NP structure
had been recognized, as a nanocatalyst, the catalytic
activity of Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag NPs was evaluated in the three-component coupling reaction of
aldehydes, amines, and alkynes (A3 coupling). Initial experiments
using phenylacetylene, morpholine, and benzaldehyde were performed
to optimize diverse parameters comprising solvent, time, temperature,
and catalyst load. The results are listed in Table 1. First, the impact of catalyst was examined,
and as expected, the desired product was not attained with no catalyst
offering the vital role of Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag NPs in the reaction mechanism (Table 1, entry 1). The reaction
yield was attained 70% by using a 0.1 mol % catalyst loading in water
at a temperature of 50 °C (Table 1, entry 2). Moreover, the reaction took place quantitatively
by using 0.1 mol % of catalyst at a temperature of 80 °C (Table 1, entry 3). Smaller
yields were attained by reducing the catalyst level to 0.06 and 0.03
mol % (Table 1, entries
4 and 5). However, using 0.03 mol % of catalyst in other solvents
containing CH2Cl2, dimethylformamide (DMF),
EtOH, toluene, CH3CN, and neat provided smaller reaction
performances (Table 1, entries 6–11). There was no change in the reaction time
and reaction performance by growing the amount of catalyst or reaction
temperature (Table 1, entries 12 and 13). Therefore, we selected water as a safe and
eco-friendly solvent, 0.1 mol % catalyst loading, and reaction temperature
of 80 °C as the most efficient and optimal reaction conditions
to study the generality of this A3 coupling.

(1.0 mmol), phenylacetylene (1.2 mmol), morpholine (1 mmol), Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag
NPs, and solvent (3.0 mL).

b Yields are based on 1H NMR.

Under the optimum reaction conditions, diverse aldehydes
were interacted
with other aliphatic amines and phenylacetylene that provided the
A3 coupling product with excellent yields and good turnover
frequencies (TOFs) (Table 2). At the initial research of the aldehyde substrate scope,
morpholine and phenylacetylene were applied as model reaction and
diverse aldehydes were examined for the A3-coupling (Table 2, entries 1–20).
The results display that aromatic aldehydes activity like functional
groups such as −Br, −Cl, −OH, −OMe, or
−Me could influence on the A3-coupling. Furthermore,
minor electronic influence was observed that is associated with the
reaction of aryl aldehydes with electron-withdrawing groups (Table 2, entries 2–4)
and formation of the correlated products in high yields, while replacement
of electron-rich groups (Table 2, entries 5–7) on the benzene ring decreased the efficiency
and resulted less yields. Moreover, reaction of heterocyclic aldehyde
like furan-2-carboxaldehyde or thiophene-2-carbaldehyde with phenylacetylene
and morpholine proceeded effectively and the relating PPAs were archived
in high yields (Table 2, entries 8 and 9). The aliphatic aldehyde (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde/butanaldehyde)
presented high yields under this optimal condition (Table 2, entries 10 and 11). To develop
the generality of amine compounds, a mixture containing phenylacetylene–benzaldehyde–amine
was chosen, and diverse amines were examined (Table 2, entries 1 and 12–16). The results
show that cyclic, heterocyclic (pyrrolidine/morpholine/piperidine),
and acyclic (dibenzyl/diethyl) secondary amines resulted in excellent
yields of products (Table 2, entries 1 and 12–15). However, no product was obtained
by aniline as a substrate (Table 2, entry 16). Curiously, the reaction of aliphatic alkyne
1-octyne, which is typically difficult to activate, reacted well and
provided the product in high yield (Table 2, entries 17–20).

a Reaction conditions: aldehyde (1.0
mmol), amine (1 mmol), alkyne (1.2 mmol), and Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag NPs (10 mg,
0.1 mol %) were stirred in water (3.0 mL) at 80 °C for 8 h.

c TOF, turnover frequency
(TOF = (yield/time)/amount

d TON,

of catalyst (mol)).

The
proposed mechanism is demonstrated in Scheme 2. At first, phenyl acetylene molecules
due to interaction p-complex attached to the AgNPs immobilized on
Fe3O4@R. tinctorum involving. On the other hand, the aldehyde is condensed with the
secondary amine to give an iminium ion. In the next step, the iminium
molecules attach to the AgNPs. Finally, coupling between iminium and
phenyl acetylene molecules was performed. The catalytic cycle continues
until the completion of the reaction.

Scheme 2 Proposed Mechanism
for Synthesis of PPA in the Presence Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag NP Catalyst
Recovery of heterogeneous noble catalysts is a very important point.
Consequently, the current research is aimed to recycle the catalyst
for the reaction system of benzaldehyde, morpholine, and phenylacetylene
under the optimal parameter. For this purpose, after compilation of
the reaction, the catalyst was separated from the reaction medium
by a magnet and washed with H2O and EtOH twice, and then
it was recovered up to seven times without significant decrease in
its catalytic performance (Figure 11). This recoverability shows the high stability and
turnover of catalyst under working conditions.

tinctorum/Ag NP catalyst.

Moreover, to study the catalyst heterogeneity, for the A3 coupling of the above model substrates, a hot filtration test was
performed with Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag NPs under the optimum conditions. The reaction yield of 65% could
be attained after 4 h, and then, the catalyst was isolated using an
external magnet. No increase in the activity of the product was observed
when the reaction was continued for an additional 4 h following the
isolation of the catalyst. This outcome proved the heterogeneous property
of the synthesized catalyst. The TEM and EDX data (Figure 12) of the catalyst following
the seven cycles confirmed the protection of the catalyst’s
nanostructure.

the seventh
run.

Three catalysts were prepared
with different loading amounts of
Ag % (0.105, 0.29, and 0.44 mmol/g), which resulted in the increase
of reaction rate with the increase of Ag in the Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag composite
(Table 3).

To prove the ability of this technique
for synthesis purposes,
the scale-up production of PPAs was studied with 4-(1,3-diphenylprop-2-ynyl)morpholine
(Table 2, entry 1)
as a model reaction. The results are shown in Table 4. The A3-coupling reaction between
benzaldehyde, phenylacetylene, and morpholine proceeded successfully,
and the product was attained in high yields almost comparable to those
in the small-scale reactions. The results of scale-up tests revealed
that the purified product yield was 82% if the reaction scale was
100 mmol.

Conclusions
This research introduced an efficient, easy, green, and economical
technique for synthesizing Fe3O4@R. tinctorum as a metal reductant and stabilizer
agent and used it for the preparation of Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag NPs. The characterization
of particles was performed using the FT-IR, SEM, energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), TEM, XRD, XPS, and VSM methods. The achieved
Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag NPs were reported to be air-stable, economic, and effective for
the preparation of PPAs through one-pot three-component A3-coupling of amines, aldehydes, and alkynes. The products of the
A3-coupling reaction were obtained in good to excellent
yields and the catalyst was recovered for seven runs with no loss
in its catalytic performance. The main properties of the suggested
method do not need homogeneous catalysts, providing high product yields;
use of a plant extract as a green and fast synthetic method for modifying
MNPs; no need of surfactants, capping agents, or templates; easy immobilization
of Ag NPs; and catalyst recoverability.

Preparations of Fe3O4@R.
tinctorum by R. tinctorum Extract
R. tinctorum powder
(0.5 g, Ronas) was poured into 50 ml of Milli-Q water and agitated
at a temperature of 50 °C for 20 min. Next, the extract was filtered
through Whatman no. 1 filter paper and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for
5 min to separate unwanted aggregates. The filtered extract is utilized
for the following phase.

For the preparation of Fe3O4@R. tinctorum NPs in
the first stage, magnetite NP (500 mg) was distributed in 100 mL of
water and sonicated for 20 min. Then, the R. tinctorum extract was poured into the mixture. Subsequently, the solution
was agitated for 3 days at ambient temperature, and then, the Fe3O4@R. tinctorum NPs
precipitate achieved was isolated by magnetic decantation and washed
several times with deionized water. Finally, it is dried in a vacuum
oven at 40 °C for 12 h.

Preparation of the Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag NPs
The
Fe3O4@R. tinctorum NPs (500 mg)
were distributed in deionized water (200 mL) via sonication for 30
min. Then, a solution containing AgNO3 (30 mg) in 20 mL
of H2O was poured into dispersion and the solution was
agitated for 5 h at ambient temperature to guarantee full reduction
of Ag(I) ions in the precursor solution. Next, the Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag NPs were isolated
by magnetic decantation and rinsed with H2O and acetone
to eliminate the unattached substrates. Scheme 1 showed the synthetic process of Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag NPs.
The last nanocatalyst was dried in vacuum at a temperature of 40 °C.
The amount of silver was 0.105 mmol/g, which was measured by ICP-AES.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of PPAs Using Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag NPs
The Fe3O4@R. tinctorum/Ag catalyst (10 mg, 0.1 mol %) was added to the mixture of aldehyde
(1 mmol), phenylacetylene (1.2 mmol), and amine (1 mmol) in H2O (3 mL) and the mixture was agitated at a temperature of
80 °C. At the end of the reaction, the catalyst was isolated
using a magnet, rinsed with ethanol, and dried for another cycle.
The product mixtures were isolated with EtOAc and concentrated to
obtain the crude product. In the next step, the crude product was
purified using a silica gel column chromatography (70:30, hexane/EtOAc).
All compounds were identified and characterized using spectral analysis
or melting points.74−85
