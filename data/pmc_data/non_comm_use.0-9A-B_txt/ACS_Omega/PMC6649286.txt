In recent years, people pay more
attention to environmental pollution
and the treatment of sewage has become the focus of recent research.
Palladium nanoparticles have good catalytic properties but are easy
to agglomerate. Therefore, we used the electrospinning technology
to prepare a uniform composite nanofiber film based on polyacrylic
acid (PAA) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), which demonstrated that they
are good carriers of palladium nanoparticles to make the nanoparticles
well dispersed. Furthermore, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were added to
increase the specific surface area of the composite nanofiber film
and improve its mechanical properties. The successfully synthesized
PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@palladium nanoparticle (PdNP) composite fiber films
were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron
microscopy, and thermogravimetry analysis. p-Nitrophenol
and 2-nitroaniline were utilized as typical pollutants to further
evaluate the catalytic performance of PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP composite
fiber films. The PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP composite fiber films exhibited
enhanced catalytic performance and could be reused for eight consecutive
cycles. This work provided new clues for the preparation and application
of composite electrospun film materials.

1 Introduction
Electrospinning is a special
fiber manufacturing process of nanofibers
by driving a jet of charged polymer solution out of a needle in an
electric field. Under the electric field, the droplets at the needle
change from a spherical shape to a conical shape (Taylor cone), and
the fiber filaments are extended from the conical tip, by which it
is possible to produce polymer filaments of nanometer diameter.1−3 Electrospinning technology has shown wide applications in the manufacture
of filter membranes,4 biomedicals,5 and sensors6 because
of its low spinning cost,7 a broadly applicable
material system, and easy control of the process.8 Nanofibers prepared by the electrospinning technology have
controllability of fiber diameter,9 high
tensile strength,10,11 and large specific surface area.12−17

Industrial wastewater from textiles, paper, and printing contains
large amounts of organic pollutants, causing serious damage to water,
air, and human health.18−23 Therefore, improving the removal rate of organic pollutants in industrial
wastewater has become a key issue to be solved. Palladium nanoparticles
(PdNPs) play an important role in the field of catalysis and adsorption
because of their large specific surface area and high surface activity.24−26 It is a common method to immerse electrospun fiber films in a precursor
solution and then obtain a precious metal/electrospun fiber composite
material by in situ reduction. Han et al. prepared electrospun fibers
based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyethyleneimine (PEI). The
fibers were then immersed in a silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution
for in situ reduction to obtain surface Ag-loaded PVA/PEI electrospun
fibers.27 Xiao et al. used polyacrylic
acid (PAA) as a matrix material to obtain PAA/PVA fibers by thermal
cross-linking, and the heat-treated electrospun fibers were immersed
in AgNO3 solution, followed by the addition of sodium borohydride
to prepare Ag-loaded PAA/PVA electrospun fibers.28 In addition, carbon nanotube (CNT)-composited materials
have attracted great attention because of their excellent properties
in many fields such as in catalysis.29,30

In this
work, our targeted experiments were designed to load Pd
nanoparticles onto the electrospinning film to improve the catalytic
properties of the films. The PVA/PAA/CNT-COOH composite fiber films
were prepared according to the previous work.31 The obtained composite fiber films were immersed in a PdCl2 solution after heat treatment, and the Pd-loaded PVA/PAA/CNT-COOH
composite fiber films (PVA/PAA/CNT-COOH@PdNPs) could be prepared by
adding sodium borohydride. 2-Nitroaniline (2-NA) and p-nitrophenol (4-NP) were used to study the catalytic reduction of
the composite fiber films. Furthermore, the stability of the composite
fiber films was evaluated by cyclic catalysis of 4-NP. This work provides
new ideas for the preparation and application of self-assembled materials.32−37

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
of PVA/PAA/CNT-COOH@PdNP
Composite Films
Figure 1 shows the synthesis process of PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP
composite spinning fiber films. First, PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH composite
fiber films were prepared by electrospinning and heat treatment. The
obtained PVA/PAA/CNT-COOH spinning fiber film was immersed in PdCl2 solution, and through the condensation reaction between hydroxyl
and carboxyl groups, Pd nanoparticles were slowly loaded onto the
spinning fiber films. It is worth noting that the PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH
composite fiber film was used as a carrier for PdNPs, which effectively
avoids a large amount of aggregation of PdNPs and exhibited good catalytic
performance and stability. Finally, the prepared PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP
composite fiber films were used to characterize the catalytic properties
and stability of 4-NP and 2-NA.

of PVA/PAA/CNT-COOH@PdNP
composites spinning fiber films.

Figure 2 shows
the
morphological characteristics of PAA/PVA, PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH, and PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP
composite fiber films. It could be clearly observed from Figure 2a,b that PAA/PVA
electrospinning fibers were long and straight, which showed the fiber
structure with the main diameter range of 400–500 nm. Figure 2c,d shows that a
large number of spindle-like structures occurred, which indicated
that CNT-COOH could not disperse well in the spinning solution. In
addition, CNT-COOH could combine with some hydroxyl groups in the
PVA molecule, which was a thermal cross-linking reaction.38 CNT-COOH would not fall off the spinning fiber
films and played a supporting role, which made the spinning fiber
film structure more stable. Moreover, the addition of CNT-COOH could
improve the mechanical properties of the composite fiber films.39,40 The morphologies and the element distribution of PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP
nanocomposite fiber films are shown in Figures 2e,f and 3, respectively.
From Figure 2e,f, it
could be clearly seen that Pd nanoparticles were loaded on the surface
of the fiber. The same result could be obtained from Figure 3, which confirmed the existence
of a large number of Pd nanoparticles.

TEM measurements were performed
to further investigate the morphological
characteristics of the composite fiber films. From Figure 4a,b, it could be clearly seen
that the PAA/PVA spinning fiber films were long and straight, which
was consistent with the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results. Figure 4c,d shows that CNT-COOH
embedded in the spinning fibers caused spindle-like structures on
PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH fiber films. In addition, after the PVA/PAA/CNT-COOH
spinning fiber film was immersed in PdCl2 solutions, PdNPs
were observed from Figure 4e,f. Therefore, it could be concluded that PdNPs were successfully
loaded on the surface of PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH composite fiber films, which
made the composite fiber films exhibit good catalytic activity and
stability.

The thermal stability of the samples were analyzed
by thermogravimetry
(TG) as shown in Figure 5. The TG curves of PAA/PVA, PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH, and PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP
composite fiber films were measured in argon atmosphere. The mass
loss below 150 °C could be considered as evaporation of moisture
in the sample. From 280 to 480 °C, it showed that the mass of
the spinning fiber samples was drastically reduced, which could be
attributed to the thermal decomposition of the carbon skeleton in
PVA and PAA molecules. The mass of the spinning fiber films reached
a stable state above 480 °C. Furthermore, the mass loss of PVA/PAA
fiber films was about 77.9%, whereas those of PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH and
PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP fiber films were 82.5 and 83.4%, respectively.
The results demonstrated that the addition of CNT-COOH and PdNPs affected
the thermal stability of composite fiber films.

2.2 Catalytic Performances of PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP
Composite Films
In recent years, self-assembled materials
have been used in many fields, such as biology,41 photoelectrochemistry,42−46 chemical modification,47−49 and catalysis.22 2-NA and 4-NP were chosen as typical models
to explore the catalytic performances of PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP composite
fiber films. First, we studied the catalytic experiment of 2-NA and
the product after being reduced was o-phenylenediamine
(OPD).50 A full-wavelength scan of 2-NA
(0.005 mol/L) by a UV–vis spectrophotometer revealed that the
maximum absorption peak was at 415 nm as shown in Figure 6a. After adding the NaBH4 solution, the maximum absorption peak position had not changed
and the color of the solution became yellow-green. Furthermore, the
absorbance of 2-NA and excessive NaBH4 was almost unchanged
within 48 h. We also measured the specific process of catalytic reaction
after adding PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP composite fiber films. A full-wavelength
scan was performed every 5 min after adding PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNPs
into a 2-NA and NaBH4 mixture solution with the obtained
results exhibited in Figure 6b. From Figure 6b, it could be seen that the characteristic absorption peak at 415
nm gradually decreased, the absorbance hardly changed after 30 min,
and the color changed from bright yellow to colorless. The results
indicated that 2-NA was completely catalyzed to OPD in the presence
of PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP composite fiber films.

Figure 6 UV–vis spectrum

(b) catalytic reduction of 2-NA by PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNPs; (c) 4-NP,
4-NP, and NaBH4; (d) catalytic reduction of 4-NP by PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNPs.

The catalytic performance of the
composited spinning fiber films
was also evaluated by 4-NP (Figure 6c). The maximum absorption wavelength of 4-NP (0.005
mol/L) was monitored at 317 nm by a UV–vis spectrophotometer.
When the NaBH4 solution was added into the 4-NP solution,
the NaBH4 molecule provided a negative hydrogen ion to
attack the 4-NP molecule and then formed a sodium 4-NP molecule. Compared
with the 4-NP solution, the characteristic absorption peak of 4-NP
and the NaBH4 mixture solution showed a red shift to 401
nm. At the same time, the color of the mixture solution changed from
yellow to yellow-green. After adding an excess of NaBH4 solution, it took only a few seconds for 4-NP to react into sodium
4-nitrophenolate. In addition, the absorption peak at 401 nm was almost
unchanged after 48 hours, indicating that the 4-NP did not react with
NaBH4. The full-wavelength scan was performed every 5 min
after adding PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP composite fiber films. Figure 6d shows that the
absorbance value of the mixture solution gradually decreased at 401
nm and the absorbance no longer changed after 25 min, indicating that
the reaction had reached equilibrium in the presence of PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP
composite fiber films. The same conclusion could be obtained from
the color of the mixture solution before and after the reaction. It
could be explained that as the catalytic reaction proceeds, the nitro
group in the sodium 4-NP molecule was reduced to the amino group by
PdNPs, and the final product was 4-aminophenol (4-AP). 4-NP was a
toxic and strong stimulating pesticide intermediate; however, it could
be reduced to the less toxic 4-AP with the PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP composite
fiber films as catalyst.51−53 In conclusion, the good catalytic
performances of PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP composite fiber films could
be confirmed by catalytic degradation of 2-NA and 4-NP.

2.3 Kinetic Evaluation and Cyclic Stability of
PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP Composite Fiber Films
As an excess
of NaBH4 solution (CNaBH4/C4-NP = 400) was added
during the catalysis, the reaction of NaBH4 and 4-NP was
considered as pseudo-first-order kinetics related to the 4-NP concentration.54,55Figure 7a shows the
kinetic fitting data of catalytic 4-NP. According to the Lambert–Beer
law A = K·b·c, the value of Ct/C0 was proportional
to At/A0,56 where A is the absorbance, K is the molar absorption coefficient, c is the concentration of the light-absorbing substance,
and b is the thickness of the absorbing layer. Ct and C0 are the concentrations at time t and initial,
respectively, A0 and At are the absorbance of the initial solution
and at time t at 401 nm, respectively. The obtained
data were calculated and a linear fitting curve of reaction time t and ln(Ct/C0) obtained as shown in Figure 7a. The kinetic constant was
0.43 min–1 according to the linear fitting principle,
which was closely correlated to the catalytic performance. Stability
and recyclability are important metrics for evaluating the efficiency
of catalysts. In this work, the prepared PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP composite
fiber films were used to continuously catalyze the fresh 4-NP and
NaBH4 mixture solutions. After eight cycles of catalysis, Figure 7b shows that the
catalytic efficiency of PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP composite fiber films
for the NaBH4 and 4-NP mixture solution could still reach
95%. With the number of cycles increased, the conversion rate of 4-NP
decreased slightly, which might be due to multiple washing of the
PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP composite fiber films. However, the stability
of composite fiber films was still good. The results of catalytic
experiments demonstrated that PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP composite fiber
films had excellent catalytic performance and high stability, and
the prepared composite fiber films exhibited broad application prospects
in the field of catalysts.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
new PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP composite fiber films were
successfully prepared by electrospinning technology and in situ reduction.
The obtained PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP composite fiber film was used for
catalytic reduction of 4-NP and 2-NA to evaluate the catalytic performance.
The experiment results showed that 4-NP and 2-NA could be reduced
by PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP composite fiber films in a short time. In
addition, the prepared PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP composite fiber films
were used in the cyclic catalytic test to further evaluate the stability.
After eight cycles, the catalytic efficiencies of 4-NP and 2-NA were
maintained at 95 and 92%, demonstrating enhanced catalytic performance
and stability of the present self-assembled composite electrospun
films.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
PVA (Mw = 87 000–98 000,
98–99%
hydrolysis) was purchased from Aladdin Company. PAA (Mw = 2000), 4-NP, 2-NA, palladium chloride (PdCl2), carboxylated CNTs (CNT-COOH), and NaBH4 were purchased
from Alfa Aesar Company. Ultrapure water was prepared by Millipore’s
ultra-microporous filtration system. The ultrapure water used in the
experiments was obtained by a Milli-Q water purification system.

4.2 Preparation of PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH Composite
Fiber Films
PVA (0.5 g) was dissolved in ultrapure water
with magnetic stirring for 10 h at 90 °C, and 10 wt % solution
was prepared. PAA (0.6 g) was dissolved in ultrapure water and stirred
for 1 h at room temperature to prepare 30 wt % aqueous solution. Then,
the obtained PAA and PVA aqueous solutions were mixed at a mass ratio
of 5:2 (PAA/PVA). CNT-COOH was added into the mixture solution to
make the concentration of CNT-COOH 1 mg/mL. Stirring at room temperature
until the mixture solution was uniform, electrospinning was carried
out. The homogeneous PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH mixture solution was slowly
poured into a 10 mL syringe, the air bubbles drained, the voltage
set to 20 kV, the step pump speed was 0.5 mL/h, and the spinning needle
was 15 cm away from aluminum foil. The prepared spinning fibers were
vacuum-dried at 25 °C for 24 h, and then the temperature was
raised to 120 °C and dried for 3 h to obtain PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH
composite fiber films.

4.3 Preparation of PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP
Composite
Fiber Films
PdCl2 powder was dissolved in ultrapure
water to form a 300 μM PdCl2 solution, and then 0.01
M NaBH4 solution was added into 10 mL of PdCl2 solution with high-speed stirring. The obtained solution was brown-yellow,
which indicated that Pd2+ ions had in situ formed palladium
nanoparticles (PdNPs). The prepared PdNP solution was washed three
times with ultrapure water under centrifuge (8000 rpm) to remove excess
NaBH4. Then, the PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH composite fiber film
was immersed in the PdCl2 solution for 2 h, and the PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP
composite fiber film could be prepared. The composite spinning film
would be washed with ultrapure water several times and then dried
at room temperature for later experiments.

4.4 Evaluation
of Catalytic Reduction Performance
Catalytic properties of
PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP composite fibers
were characterized by reduction and degradation of 2-NA and 4-NP.
Freshly prepared NaBH4 solution (20 mL) was added as a
reducing agent to 10 mL of 2-NA and 4-NP (0.005 M), respectively,
and then PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP composite fiber spun films were added
to obtain a mixture solution. The absorbance of the mixture solution
was measured every 5 min by an ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
spectrophotometer. Two solutions changed from yellow to colorless,
indicating the finish of reaction. In addition, the catalytic stability
of the PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP composite fiber films was also studied.
The PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP composite fiber films were reused to catalyze
the 4-NP solution. Eight cycles of catalytic measurement of PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP
composite fibers were performed and the absorbance values within the
same reaction time were measured, which could be further calculated
to obtain the conversion of 4-NP.

4.5 Characterization
In order to observe
the morphology of the composite fiber films, we used an S-4800II scanning
electron microscope by adjusting the accelerated voltage to 5–15
kV. A Hitachi HT7700 transmission electron microscope was used to
analyze the morphology and elements of the fiber film. The thermal
stability of the samples was tested by a DTG-60 TG analyzer in argon
atmosphere and the heating rate was 10 °C/min. The data of catalytic
performance and stability of the PAA/PVA/CNT-COOH@PdNP composite fiber
film were characterized by a UV2550 spectrophotometer.
