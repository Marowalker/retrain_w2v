A novel
microencapsulated intumescent flame retardant (TMAPP) was
prepared, in which ammonium polyphosphate (APP) is the core and functions
as an acid source, melamine–urea formaldehyde (MUF) resin is
in the intermediate layer and functions as a blowing agent, and ferric
tannin (mimicking mussel) is in the outermost shell layer and functions
as a carbonization agent and also as a smoke inhibitor and surface
modifier. TMAPP was prepared by treating MUF-microencapsulated APP
with tannin acid and FeCl3. Its structure is characterized
by Fourier transform infrared, elemental analysis, and thermogravimetry
(TG). TMAPP in epoxy was evaluated for its effect on flame retardancy
and mechanical properties. The flame-retardant and smoke suppression
performances of EP/TMAPP were studied using cone calorimetry (CONE)
and limit oxygen index, and the flame-retardant mechanism was investigated
by scanning electron microscopy and TG. The resultant data indicate
that EP/TMAPP has very good mechanical properties, flame retardancy,
and smoke suppression, whose char residue and thermal stability are
increased, and the initial decomposition temperatures are decreased.
Meanwhile, the char residue structures were very intumescent and compact.
The char residue effectively prevents the underlying materials of
EP/TMAPP from further combustion.

Introduction
In recent years, polymer materials have
been widely used in home
appliances, building materials, transportation, electronics, electrical
appliances, aerospace, and other fields.1,2 However, polymeric
materials are generally very flammable. Thus, they are generally treated
with different flame retardants to decrease the combustibility of
polymers,3 and the preparation and application
of flame retardants have become an important subject in the polymer
field. However, the major problems of polymeric materials containing
halogen flame retardants are the generation of corrosive and toxic
gases during combustion. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare and
use nonhalogenated additives, in which an intumescent flame retardant
(IFR) is thought to be an alternative to a halogen flame retardant.

Generally, there are three main ingredients in an IFR: carbon source,
gas source, and acid source. A phosphorus-containing material is an
acid source in IFR, which first degrades to promote the char residue
formation during combustion. The gas source is often made of nitrogen-containing
compounds, releasing incombustible gases during combustion, which
can swell the formed char residue. The swollen char can isolate the
exchange of heat and mass between the flame and the materials in fire
(i.e., protecting the unburned materials).4−6 Ammonium polyphosphate
(APP) as a halogen-free IFR is widely used with very good flame retardancy.
However, because of the poor compatibility in a polymer, APP is easily
hydrolyzed and migrated in wet conditions,7 whose application field was thus limited. Therefore, some surface
modification technologies are developed, such as microencapsule technology,8 the sol–gel method,9 in situ coatings,10 and silane-coupling
agent tailoring.11 Microencapsulation of
APP as reported could effectively modify the compatibility in the
polymer and improve its water resistance.

In previous studies,
microencapsulation of APP has successfully
overcome these problems. The melamine–urea formaldehyde (MUF)
resin was commonly used in the microencapsulation of the APP, which
not only can improve its poor water resistance, but also increase
the flame retardancy, because of the synergistic effect of P–N.12 However, the melamine–urea formaldehyde
APP (MAPP) contains the acid source, blowing agent, but only a little
carbonization agent as an IFR.

Mussels are common creatures
living in the ocean, which can secrete
strong adhesion protein, clinging to the surface of many substances
such as bone grafts, plants, glass products, metal components, polymer
materials, minerals, and so forth.13−16 Many research studies are focused
on revealing and mimicking the adhesive materials. The mimicking mussel
is widely used in medicine, food, metallurgy, and other fields,17−19 whose application in the surface modification of the flame retardant
has not been reported. Tannic acid is a complex polyhydric phenol,
in which there are multiple phenolic hydroxyl groups, which can be
a carbonization agent in IFR and simultaneously form a stable chelate
with Fe3+. This chelate can form a nanoscale film cling
to any substrate interface, which is very similar to the mussel adhesive
material.20,21

In this research, a novel microencapsulated
IFR via chelation reaction
of tannic acid with Fe3+ on the surface of MAPP (TMAPP)
was prepared. Its compatibility in the polymer matrix and flame retardancy
were greatly improved because of its adhesion and making-up carbonization
agent. Meanwhile, Fe3+ in ferric tannin can be a smoke inhibitor
to decrease the generation of the smoke during combustion. TMAPP as
a flame retardant was applied to epoxy resin (EP) to obtain very good
mechanical properties, flame retardancy and smoke suppression.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Epoxy resin (E-44) and a polyamide curing
agent were obtained from Nantong Xingchen Synthetic Material Co.,
Ltd., Shanghai, China, MAPP as a flame retardant was obtained from
Hangzhou JLS Flame Retardants Chemical Co., Ltd., Jiangsu, China,
and tannic acid and FeCl3 were purchased from an analytical
reagent from Tianjin Yongda Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China.

Preparation
of TMAPP
The preparation procedure of TMAPP
is shown in Scheme 1 as follows: first, MAPP (100 g), deionized water (250 mL), tannic
acid (5 g) solution, and FeCl3 (8.4 g) were mixed during
mechanical stirring in a three-necked round-bottom flask. Several
minutes later, MAPP (50 g) was put into the flask, and the mixture
was adjusted to 8.5 pH with the addition of NaOH. The suspension was
reacted for 10 min at 25 °C followed by the addition of deionized
water. TMAPP was obtained after centrifuging, washing, and drying.

Preparation of Epoxy Resin Samples
First, 63.5 g of
epoxy resin and 15 g of MAPP or TMAPP were well mixed for 20 min at
1500 rpm in a dispersion machine. Then, 21.5 g of curing agent was
put into the mixture and uniformly stirred for 5 min. Finally, the
mixture was added to molds, which were controlled at 25 °C for
24 h. The formulations of EP are presented in Table 1.

Testing
The MAPP
and TMAPP structures were evaluated
by a Nicolet iS5 infrared spectrometer (American Nicolet Corporation).
The elemental analysis was evaluated by a Carlo Eroa 1102 Elemental
Analyzer. The sample size for the limit oxygen index (LOI) test was
evaluated as 90 × 10 × 3 mm3 by a JF-3 LOI apparatus
(Nanjing Jiangning Analytical Instrument Factory) according to ASTM
D 2863-97. Vertical burning (UL-94) tests were carried out on a CZF-2-type
instrument (Suzhou Feinikesi Quality Inspection Instrument Co., Ltd.,
China) with a dimension of 130 × 13 × 3 mm3 according
to the UL-94 test standard. The mechanical property tests were carried
out by a CMT4204 universal testing machine (Meitesi Industrial Systems
(China) Co., Ltd) according to GB/T 1040.2-2006 (China). Thermogravimetry
(TG) was evaluated by an HCT-2 thermal analyzer (China) under an air
atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1. The sample size for the cone calorimetry experiments was evaluated
as 100 × 100 × 3.2 mm3 by PX-07-007 (China) according
to ISO5660 under a heat flux of 50 kW·m–2.
The typical results from the mechanical property, LOI, TG, and cone
calorimetry tests were the average from the three measurements. The
morphologies of the chars were studied by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) (KYKYEM-3200, China).

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of TMAPP
The procedure and schematic
of the prepared structure are shown in Scheme 1a. Ferric tannin could be distributed on
the surface of MAPP. The SEM images of MAPP and TMAPP are shown in Scheme 1b,c; we can see that
there is almost no change after ferric tannin modification. The coordination
constant of ferric tannin was lg K = 24.6 in 0.1
M NaCl solution at 20 °C,22 which
demonstrated the reliable stability of the chelate. The structure
of MAPP had no obvious change after ferric tannin modification (Scheme 1). The Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra of MAPP and TMAPP are shown in Figure 1. For MAPP, which includes
APP and MUF resin, the main absorption peaks at 3200, 1695, 1564,
and 1100 cm–1 are assigned to the stretching vibrations
of N–H and −OH, C=O, and C–O groups in
the MUF resin, respectively.23 Meanwhile,
the absorption peaks at 1420, 1250, 1000, and 850 cm–1 are assigned to the P=O and P–O groups in APP. For
TMAPP, it is obvious that the above typical absorption peaks become
broad, which are due to the covering of MAPP by microcapsules. The
new absorption peaks at 1615 and 1620 cm–1 are assigned
to the stretching vibrations of aromatic ring groups,24 and the absorption peaks at 3394 cm–1 become larger because of more phenolic hydroxyl groups, which are
the characteristic groups of the ferric tannin chelate. The spectrum
of TMAPP reveals well-defined absorption peaks of MAPP and characteristic
bands of ferric tannin chelate, which indicates that MAPP is successfully
microencapsulated by ferric tannin.

Figure 1 FTIR spectra of MAPP and TMAPP.

The elements of MAPP and TMAPP
were determined and presented in Table 2. It can be seen that
the amount of elemental N and P of TMAPP was 6.82 and 2.74%, respectively,
which was lower than that of MAPP (35.73 and 12.02%). On the contrary,
the amount of elemental C and O of TMAPP (44.54 and 30.51%) was much
higher than that of MAPP (32.54 and 19.86%). There was a new elemental
Fe (15.39%) in TMAPP, from ferric tannin. All these changes may be
because of the coverage of MAPP with ferric tannin chelate, which
indicates that MAPP was indeed encapsulated by the shell.

FMAPP
 	C/%	N/%	P/%	O/%	Fe/%	
MAPP	32.40	35.73	12.01	19.86	 	
TMAPP	44.54	6.82	2.74	30.51	15.39	
The TG and differential thermogravimetry
(DTG) of MAPP and TMAPP
results are shown in Figures 2 and 3 and Table 3. Degradation of MAPP is mainly composed
of two stages. The first stage from 217 to 600 °C with a mass
loss of 37.8% and a Tmax of 336 °C
is due to the degradation of MF resin and cleavage of P–O in
MAPP, which releases phosphorus oxides and some nonflammable gases,
such as NH3 and CO2, as the mentioned gases
swell the char to form a “honeycomb’’ structure.25 MAPP mainly degrades in the second stage at
above 600 °C with a Tmax of 666 °C.
The residue of MAPP at 900 °C is only 11.2%, which indicates
that some phosphorus oxides can evaporate at higher temperatures.26

MAPP	193	336	37.8	666	11.2	
TMAPP	217	336	33.3	685	14.6	
TMAPP initially degrades at 217 °C,
higher than the initial
decompose temperature (Ti) of MAPP, which
is due to more thermal stability of ferric tannin than MUF in TMAPP.
The Tmax of TMAPP is almost the same as
MAPP in the first stage but less mass loss for TMAPP at the same temperature,
whereas the Tmax value in the second stage
and the residue at 900 °C is 685 °C and 14.6%, respectively,
both higher than those of MAPP, which is attributed to the action
of ferric tannin as a carbon source in TMAPP.

Mechanical Properties of
EP Samples
The data of tensile
strength and elongation of the EP composites are presented in Table 4. We can see that
the mechanical properties of EP composites decrease with the addition
of flame retardants, which is in agreement with the previous research.27 Commonly, the tensile strength and elongation
of EP composites are significantly influenced by solid additives.
After microencapsulated by the ferric tannin, the elongation at break
and tensile strength for EP/TMAPP increase by 27.5 and 13.9%, respectively,
compared with those for EP/MAPP. It is suggested that the compatibility
of MAPP in EP composites was modified by microencapsulation because
the ferric tannin mimicking mussel can readily adhere to the interface
between MAPP and EP. The resulting materials had improved mechanical
properties because of surface modification, which was also observed
in the SEM images of the fracture surface shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 SEM results of the microstructure
of the failure section of EP
with (a) MAPP and (b) TMAPP.

EP/MAPP	60.2(±0.20)	5.1(±0.19)	
EP/TMAPP	69.9(±0.17)	6.5(±0.20)	
As shown in Figure 4, the sample section of EP/MAPP had obvious MAPP lumps,
and there
was a distinct phase separation at the interface between MAPP and
EP. This indicated that MAPP was more prone to self-aggregation due
to the strong polarity interaction of MAPP with itself because of
the poor compatibility of MAPP with EP. However, the sample section
of EP/TMAPP shows tiny bits of TMAPP and some ductile holes. This
indicated that the surface modification of the bioadhesive mussel
coating could greatly improve the compatibility between the interfaces
of EP and MAPP, resulting in the improvement of their mechanical properties.

Flame Retardancy of EP
LOI test is widely used to evaluate
the flammability of flame-retardant materials, and the corresponding
data are presented in Table 5. As presented in Table 5, EP is flammable with a LOI of only 19.5%, and it
cannot pass the UL-94 test, which indicates that the pure EP sample
is flammable. With the addition of MAPP or TMAPP contents in the EP
composite, the LOI of the EP composites is greatly increased; 35.6%
of LOI was observed in 15% of MAPP whereas 37.3% of LOI was obtained
in the same content of TMAPP, and their UL-94 rating is V–0.
This increase of flame retardancy is due to the intervention of ferric
tannin, which can be a good carbonization agent in IFR because of
its multihydroxyl phenolic structure.

Cone Calorimeter Test
A cone calorimeter can effectively
evaluate and compare the combustibility of a polymeric material. Some
important parameters of EP composites are shown in Figures 5–8 and listed in Table 5.

Figure 5 HRR of EP samples.

Figure 6 THR of EP samples.

Figure 7 Smoke production rate of EP samples.

Figure 8 TSP rate of EP samples.

The heat release for the material on heat is a key parameter
to
fire. The heat release rate (HRR) and total heat release (THR) curves
as functions of combustion time of all samples are shown in Figures 5 and 6. We can see from Figure 5 and Table 5 that the ignition time (time to ignition) for pure EP is
44 s. The HRR of pure EP shows a single peak with a peak HRR (PHRR)
of 445.9 kW·m–2 at 123 s, which indicates that
the pure EP burns brightly and gradually. When MAPP is imported, the
ignition time becomes longer (53 s) and multipeak phenomena were displayed
for EP/MAPP. The greater peak is attributed to the initial burning.
The decreasing HRR shows that a swollen char layer is formed on the
surface of the EP composites. With further increase of the temperature,
part of the char layer is destroyed, and the materials burn again
with the back peaks.28 For EP/TMAPP, the
ignition time decreases from 53 to 49 s compared with EP/MAPP. This
may be attributed to the lower content of APP in EP/TMAPP, but its
PHRR is 115.6 kW·m–2, decreased compared with
EP/MAPP (144.5 kW·m–2). It is suggested that
TMAPP may form more char layers, which effectively insulate heat and
oxygen during burning. It is shown in Figure 6 that the largest slope of pure EP shows
the quickest fire spreads among all EP composites. The THR of EP/TMAPP
is lower than that of EP/MAPP all the time, which indicates that more
char layers are formed in EP/TMAPP because of the presence of ferric
tannin as a carbonization agent in TMAPP.29−31

The smoke
produced by polymeric materials is one of the important
parameters to evaluate fire hazard. The smoke produce rate (SPR) and
total smoke production (TSP) curves of all the samples are shown in Figures 7 and 8, respectively. The SPR of EP regularly rises to a maximum
of 0.35 m2·s–2 after 124 s, whereas
these values for EP/MAPP are 0.12 m2·s–2 and 153 s, much decreased and postponed, which indicates that some
isolating char on the surface of EP/MAPP may be formed to prevent
thermal decomposition. For EP/TMAPP, the SPR peak further decreases
to 0.10 m2·s–2 at 83 s. It is suggested
that Fe3+ in TMAPP can catalyze carbonization to form the
effective char layer, decreasing the smoke produced.31 As shown in Figure 7, the TSR values of EP, EP/MAPP, and EP/TMAPP are 7268, 2768,
and 2663, respectively, drastically decreased with the presence of
MAPP and TMAPP. The lower TSR for EP/TMAPP is attributed to the action
of Fe3+, reported as a smoke inhibitor.32,33

Thermogravimetric Analysis
The thermal stability and
degradation of materials are often evaluated by TG. The TG and DTG
curves of the EP composites are shown in Figures 9 and 10, and the related
TG and DTG data are presented in Table 6. We can see that the thermal degradation of EP samples
also has two main stages, which reveal thermo-oxidative decomposition
behavior. The first stage of degradation is due to the cleavage of
C–H and O–H and the formation of char, and the second
stage can be assigned to further decomposition of the formed char
in the action of O2 at higher temperature. For pure EP,
the Ti was 318 °C and its residue
about 3.4% at 900 °C. In comparison with the pure EP, the Ti of EP/MAPP and EP/TMAPP much decreased. This
decrease in Ti is mainly because of the
lower decomposition temperature of the flame retardants, which makes
the formation of the protective char easy.32 Therefore, the decomposition of EP/MAPP and EP/TMAPP in the later
stage was much decreased, compared with EP. EP/MAPP and EP/TMAPP have
similar TG curves. However, EP/TMAPP had a higher residue (18.9%)
than EP/MAPP (residue 12.9%), owing to the presence of ferric tannin
as a carbonization agent.34−36 Theoretically, the enhancement
in char-yielding efficiency is believed to contribute to better flame
retardancy.

EP/MAPP	297	340	750	12.9	
EP/TMAPP	297	348	750	18.9	
SEM and Images of Char Residue
The residues of EP/TMAPP
and EP/MAPP after combustion are also considerably increased, which
were further proved by SEM and the digital images, as shown in Figure 11. The digital images
of the EP composite residues after cone calorimeter tests are shown
in Figure 11a–c.
From Figure 11a, one
can see that there is little residue for EP after the cone calorimeter
test. Figure 11b,c
shows that the residue left by EP/TMAPP and EP/MAPP was intumescent,
effectively preventing the inter EP from further combustion. In order
to further analyze the residue structure, the SEM images of the residues
of EP/TMAPP and EP/MAPP were obtained as shown in Figure 11d,e. For EP/MAPP in Figure 11d, EP/MAPP formed
breakable and loose structure, which was easily destroyed in the combustion
process. Therefore, the char layer of EP/MAPP only shows the flame
retardancy at a low level. We can see from Figure 11e that the carbonaceous layers of EP/TMAPP
were more compact, which can effectively prevent the inner EP composites
from further combustion.

Conclusions
In this paper, a novel microencapsulated
IFR, via chelation reaction
of tannic acid with Fe3+ on the surface of MAPP (TMAPP),
was successfully prepared. TMAPP as a flame retardant was added into
EP to obtain a very good smoke suppression and flame retardancy. A
high LOI of 37.3% was obtained with the addition of 15% TMAPP for
EP. For the thermal decomposition of EP/TMAPP, the Ti decreased and
the char residue increased.

Its cone calorimeter data showed
a drastic improvement in flame
retardancy and smoke suppression, as shown by HRR, THR, SPR, and TSP.
Tannin acid with a large content of hydroxyl groups can be a good
carbonization agent in IFR and ferric tannin as the smoke inhibitor.
Therefore, the ferric tannin chelate was inserted into MAPP, which
effectively promoted EP/TMAPP form a more compact expanded carbon
layer during combustion, effectively preventing the underlying materials
from further combustion.

Meanwhile, the ferric tannin chelate
can be a good surface modifier
for MAPP, which can form a mimicking mussel cling to the interface
between MAPP and EP. Therefore, the tensile strength and elongation
at the break of EP/TMAPP increased by 13.9 and 27.5%, respectively,
compared with that of EP/MAPP.
