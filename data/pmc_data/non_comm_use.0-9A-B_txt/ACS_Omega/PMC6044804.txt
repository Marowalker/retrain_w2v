Directed Evolution
is a key technology driving the utility of biocatalysis
in pharmaceutical synthesis. Conventional approaches to Directed Evolution
are conducted using bacterial cells expressing enzymes in microplates,
with catalyzed reactions measured by HPLC, high-performance liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), or optical detectors,
which require either long cycle times or tailor-made substrates. To
better fit modern, fast-paced process chemistry development
where solutions are rapidly needed for new substrates, droplet microfluidics
interfaced with electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS provides a label-free
high-throughput screening platform. To apply this method to industrial
enzyme screening and to explore potential approaches that may further
improve the overall throughput, we optimized the existing droplet–MS
methods. Carryover between droplets, traditionally a significant issue,
was reduced to undetectable level by replacing the stainless steel
ESI needle with a Teflon needle within a capillary electrophoresis
(CE)–MS source. Throughput was improved to 3 Hz with a wide
range of droplet sizes (10–50 nL) by tuning the sheath flow
within the CE–MS source. The optimized method was demonstrated
by screening reactions using two different transaminase libraries.
Good correlations (r2 ∼ 0.95) were
found between the droplet–MS and LC–MS methods, with
100% match on hit variants. We further explored the capability of
the system by performing in vitro transcription–translation
inside the droplets and directly analyzing the intact reaction mixture
droplets by MS. The synthesized protein attained comparable activity
to the protein standard, and the complex samples appeared well tolerated
by the MS. The success of the above applications indicates that the
MS analysis of the microfluidic droplets is an available option for
considerably accelerating the screening of enzyme evolution libraries.

Introduction
Biocatalysis has become
a valuable tool in the synthetic chemist’s
toolbox,1−7 often providing unmatched specificities for producing the desired
products. However, industrial substrates and reaction environments
are typically very different from those for which native enzymes have
originally evolved, and these differences often lead to the suboptimal
performance for industrial biocatalysts. Directed Evolution provides
a methodology for the retuning of an enzyme to a new substrate and
new reaction conditions by re-engineering the amino acid sequence.2,8−13 Directed Evolution is becoming widely used on many enzymes for the
chemical synthesis of commercial products.3 As an example, Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) engineered an optimized
transaminase for the production of sitagliptin that underwent 11 rounds
of Directed Evolution carried out over the course of one year, ultimately
changing 27 amino acids in the enzyme sequence.8 The large number of biocatalytic opportunities, combined
with the relatively long cycle time for each round of evolution, creates
a compelling need for speeding and simplifying the Directed Evolution
process.14

Screening of enzyme libraries
is a hallmark of Directed Evolution
and is often the rate-limiting step in a Directed Evolution project.
Consequently, improved technologies for carrying out the rapid analysis
of enzyme performance are an area of active research interest. One
exciting technology developed recently has been the advancement of
a high-throughput screening (HTS) in microfluidic droplets.15−17 This technology dramatically decreases the assay volume while increasing
the rate of analysis, enabling the rapid identification of rare, sought-after
events in the library. A recent review18 surveyed the analytical techniques currently in use for Directed
Evolution studies. Most experiments have been designed to liberate
a fluorophore upon reaction, and similar strategies have taken advantage
of chemiluminescence, electrochemistry, light scattering, and absorbance
differences between tailor-made substrates and their corresponding
products. However, as “you get what you screen for”,
the design of substrate/product pairs to match the analytical readout
is poorly received by industrial scientists, whose flexibility to
modify the desired substrate is highly limited.19 Industrial biocatalysis applications require an analytical
method that is more general, less compound specific, and faster to
develop.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is among the most preferred
detectors for
the pharmaceutical industry. It is ubiquitous, rapidly tunable to
target analytes, and highly sensitive. Two ionization technologies—electrospray
ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)—are
most widely employed. ESI-MS is more readily available due to the
lower price and the flexibility to be interfaced with liquid-introducing
sources, such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), flow
injection, and droplet microfluidics. The throughput of universally
used, conventional HPLC-ESI-MS is limited by a typical 3 min/sample,
corresponding to 2 weeks of screening for a typical round of selection
of 5000 protein variants. Alternative approaches, such as multiple
injections in a single experimental run (MISER) and RapidFire can
potentially increase the throughput to 10 s/sample,20−22 reducing the
analysis time to ∼14 h for the same size of a library. Given
the power of modern mass spectrometers to identify a product mass
in a complex sample matrix, a chromatographic step is often not necessary
to monitor enzyme activity. Interfacing droplet microfluidics with
ESI-MS would bypass the separation and therefore improve the speed.
The high-throughput droplet–MS method developed by the Kennedy
laboratory demonstrated a label-free screening with the throughput
as high as 1.7 samples/s (0.6 s/sample),23,24 further reducing the analysis time to less than 1 h for 5000 samples,
representing a 15-fold improvement over the MISER-based approaches21 and a 300-fold over typical LC–MS methods.
It is getting close to some optical methods,18 but can be achieved without the need for a surrogate substrate development.
Recent studies have also demonstrated the success of using MALDI-time-of-flight
for HTS with automatic sample preparation (∼30 min for 1536
samples), high analysis rate (∼1 s/sample),25−27 and decent
agreement with orthogonal assays (e.g., correlation coefficient r2 ∼ 0.9 with RapidFire screening25). Nevertheless, the expense of the instrument,
the consumables, and the spotting robot (e.g., mosquito) understandably
prevents the technology from being quickly adopted by most laboratories,
especially resource-limited ones.

In this work, we further tailored
the droplet–MS methodology23 for
use in Directed Evolution in pharmaceutical
process development (Figure 1). First, we implemented the technology on an Agilent single
quadrupole that is the most basic ESI-MS system at MSD. More importantly,
we generalized the method with commercially available components to
allow a rapid implementation by industrial scientists. Second, carryover
between the droplet samples was more sustainably overcome by using
a Teflon ESI needle within a capillary electrophoresis–mass
spectrometry (CE–MS) ESI source that had the added benefit
of being able to apply a sheath flow to stabilize electrospray for
certain applications. Third, the analysis rate was increased to 3
samples/s (3 Hz), which enabled screening of one 96-well plate in
30 s. Two different transaminase libraries were screened using this
optimized method. The screening results were compared with the optimized
LC–MS methods, and good correlations (r2 ∼ 0.95) were found between the two methods with 100%
match on hits. Finally, we demonstrated that the new MS configuration
was capable of handling complex cell free protein synthesis reaction
samples generated through in vitro transcription/translation (ivTT),
which offers a further speed advantage by skipping the cell growth
and protein harvest steps.

are infused into ESI-MS for high-throughput screening.

Results and Discussion
Droplet Generation
To make droplets from multiwell
plates, we purchase the XYZ positioner, attach a power supply as described
by the manufacturer, and train the positioner to multiwell plates
using a G-Code as described previously (Figure S1A).23 To verify this instrument
worked satisfactorily, the droplet carrier Teflon tubing is clamped
onto the Z positioning head and connected on the other end to a syringe
loaded into a syringe pump. A well plate is filled with blue dye and
overlaid with perfluorinated oil. With the syringe pump operating
in filling mode, the positioner moves the tubing to each well alternating
between the sample and the oil. As shown in Figure 2A, the samples are aspirated through a Teflon
sipper directly inserted into the droplet carrier tubing. The blue
dye droplets are ∼50 nL and the clear oil gap is a slightly
larger than the droplets.

Figure 2 All-Teflon fluid path for droplet generation
and droplet–MS
analysis. (A) Droplet generation is accomplished using a 120/250 Teflon
sipper connected to a 250/1600 carrier tubing via a wax seal (B) during
MS analysis droplet carrier tubing is connected to a 150/360 Teflon
needle by a zero dead volume PEEK union. (C) Alternatively, a 120/250
Teflon needle can be inserted into the droplet carrier tubing directly
and sealed with wax.

The droplet generation rate is ∼0.3 Hz (droplets/s)
from
a single plate. The XYZ positioner used in this study is capable of
parallel sample reformatting from 4 plates into 4 tubes (Figure S1A), corresponding to 1.2 Hz (∼25
min for 1536 droplets). Detaching the droplet carrier tubing from
the positioner and reattaching it to ESI-MS takes <30 s. If multiple
tubes of droplets are to be screened, each manual detaching and reattaching
needs <30 s.23 Although tubing change
is not a speed-limiting step in the entire screening process, one
can envision that a fully automated platform, potentially with a valving
control, will reduce the required time to negligible.

Carryover Elimination
with Teflon ESI Needle
Carryover
is a frequent issue when droplets are transferred from fluorophilic
Teflon tubing into nonfluoriphilic tubing due to differences in surface
chemistry. Unlike Teflon, which is wetted by the fluorinated oil that
encapsulates and prevents the aqueous samples from interacting with
each other, the hydrophilic stainless steel (SS) needle used in most
ESI sources is wetted by the aqueous samples, leading to cross contamination.
Carryover is observed in the first 5 droplets (50 nL each) of each
sample when using the default SS needle (∼9 cm) on an Agilent
single-quadrupole MS (Figure 3A). In previous studies, the carryover is mitigated by replacing
the SS needle with an internally fluorosilane-functionalized fused
silica (FS) capillary, which is externally sputter coated with gold–platinum
alloy for electrical conductivity.23 Although
the fluorinated FS capillary significantly reduced the carryover at
low analysis rate, ∼20% carryover is observed when the throughput
is increased to >3 Hz. Additionally, the process of treating the
inside
of the FS capillary to be hydrophobic and sputter coating the outside
for conductivity is time consuming and labor intensive. Therefore,
a commercial solution enabling the direct electrospray from a Teflon
needle is desired.

Figure 3 Carryover comparison between the default SS needle (A)
and a 150/360
Teflon needle (B). A series of pyridinyl amine standards from 0.05
to 1.5 mM reformatted into sets of eight 50 nL droplets were used
to evaluate the carryover. Carryover generated by SS needle is 5 droplets.
In contrast, the Teflon needle generated no carryover.

Unlike most MS that applies high voltage onto the
ESI source, the
Agilent single-quadrupole MS applies high voltage to the transferring
capillary inside the MS, whereas the ESI source remains grounded.
Such settings broaden the choice of ESI needles to those that are
nonconductive, such as Teflon. However, standard ESI sources have
a thin needle (<200 μm o.d.) and a Teflon tubing is not readily
available at such small diameters. As an alternative, the CE–MS
ESI source (Figure S1C,D) from Agilent’s
capillary electrophoresis hardware is compatible with the 360 μm
o.d. tubings that are commonly used in capillary electrophoresis and
is a commonly available size of Teflon tubing. To demonstrate the
electrospray compatibility with a Teflon tubing, we first test a 150/360
Teflon needle, connected to the droplet carrier tubing through a zero-dead-volume
union (Figure 2B),
and find that it provides a stable electrospray and a minimal carryover
(Figure 3B) for most
analytical samples. However, the droplets with complex components
are more likely to break at tubing connections. To mitigate this issue,
we replace the 150/360 needle and the union with a 120/250 Teflon
needle that can be directly inserted into the 250/1600 droplet carrier
tubing with a simple wax seal (Figure 2C). We find this configuration also provides minimal
carryover and is more suitable for fragile droplets.

The MS
signal quality using a Teflon ESI needle is evaluated with
a pyridinyl amine (Scheme 1) standard containing trace amount of pyridinyl ketone. The
amine is sampled into ∼200 droplets and continuously sprayed
into the MS. Both high amine signal and low ketone signals are detected
with fair stability over the 200 droplets (Figure S2A,B). The relative standard deviation (% RSD) was 12 and
15% for the amine and ketone, respectively; however % RSD can be reduced
to <5% by dividing the signal for a given analyte by the total
signal for both analytes (same as % conversion calculation). To determine
if the Teflon ESI needle has an effect on linear range, a series of
standards are measured (Figure S2C,D).
Response remained linear from 1 to 100 μM (r2 ∼ 0.99) and a positive correlation is observed
from 0.5 to 1000 μM, demonstrating a good sensitivity and a
wide semiquantitative window.

Throughput Improvement
with Agilent Single Quad
The
previous study demonstrates a 1.7 Hz droplet analysis rate, which
is the highest throughput robustly achievable for at least 4200+ droplets.23 The sampling rate of the Agilent single-quadrupole
MS is set by the “peak width” parameter in the MS setup
software; the fastest data acquisition rate required setting the peak
width to the lowest value (0.005 min), which corresponds to ∼35
data points/s in the MS. Assuming that 5 data points are collected
for each droplet and the same for the oil gap, the MS should support
a 3.5 Hz analysis. Infusion rate is another key factor affecting the
throughput and needs to be tuned with the droplet size to attain a
stable signal, a sufficient number of scans over each peak, and a
low pressure on droplets to avoid breakage and merging. Typical experiments
used 50 nL droplets with a 2.5:1 length-to-width ratio and with an
oil gap slightly larger than the droplets. This type of segmented
flow is found to be most stable within the 250 μm i.d. tubing.
After testing the infusion rates from 1 to 200 μL/min, 20 μL/min
was found to provide the best performance in terms of the droplet
stability, spray efficiency, and throughput for 50 nL droplets. Under
these conditions, Figure 3B demonstrates the analysis rate—44 droplets assayed
in 0.2 min, which corresponds to 3.7 Hz. Similar result is shown in Figure S2A—200 droplets detected in 0.925
min, which corresponds to 3.6 Hz.

Broader Droplet Size Compatibility
with Sheath Flow
During flow rate optimization, the electrospray
becomes unstable
at flow rates below 5 μL/min. Although such low flow rates are
unnecessary with 50 nL droplet samples, they are required for analysis
of smaller droplets (e.g., <15 nL) to avoid undersampling by MS.
Because of the low electro-osmotic flow rate in CE, the CE–MS
source has an additional inlet for the introduction of a coaxial flow
(termed “sheath flow” in CE–MS technology) to
facilitate efficient electrospray. In the same way, an additional
sheath flow can enhance the spray efficiency of the droplets. When
infusing droplets as small as 10 nL (compatible with microfluidic
devices16,28) at 5 μL/min, significant improvement
is seen in both MS signal intensity and distinguishability with the
addition of a 20 μL/min sheath flow (Figure 4). For poorly ionized compounds (ketone traces, Figure 4), the improvement
is even more pronounced. The best performance is seen when the sheath
liquid has the same solvent composition of the droplet (i.e., 20%
acetonitrile (ACN) and 0.1% formic acid). Typically, a nano-ESI source16 is required to analyze low-volume samples (e.g.,
10 nL droplets), but the addition of a sheath flow in the CE–MS
source expanded the range of sample volumes compatible with the traditional
electrospray.

Figure 4 Droplets signal enhanced by sheath flow: (A) small (10
nL) pyridinyl
amine (upper) and ketone (lower) droplets with three concentrations
were analyzed at 5 μL/min through a 150/360 Teflon needle. The
left is without sheath flow and the right is with 20 μL/min
sheath flow (20% ACN, 0.1% formic acid) (B) regular size (50 nL) amine
(upper) and ketone (lower) droplets were analyzed at 15 μL/min
through a narrower (120/250) Teflon needle. The left is without a
sheath flow and the right is with a 30 μL/min sheath flow.

The 120/250 Teflon needle is evaluated
with the same pyridinyl
amine droplets at different concentrations with or without the sheath
flow using regular size droplets (50 nL). Droplets without the sheath
flow are infused to the MS at 20 μL/min, whereas those with
the sheath flow are infused at 15 μL/min plus a sheath flow
at 30 μL/min. As illustrated in Figure 4B, the sheath flow greatly increases the
signal quality. In the process of optimizing the sheath flow rate,
we observe that when the sheath flow exceeds 30 μL/min, the
gaps between the droplet peaks contract, indicating that the total
infusion rate is too high for the MS data acquisition to distinguish
one droplet from another. After testing several flow rate combinations,
the optimal conditions are 15 μL/min droplet infusion and a
30 μL/min sheath flow.

Transaminase ATA-036 Screening
Once
the stability and
feasibility of utilizing this CE–MS source and the Teflon needle
are confirmed, the new droplet–MS system is used for variant
library screening. The parent transaminase is able to convert methyl
4-methyl-3-oxopentanoate (ketoester) to its corresponding amine, which
then spontaneously undergoes hydrolysis under the reaction conditions
to form β-leucine as the final product (Scheme 2). Eighty-four variants are mapped to individual
well in rows A–D, and F–H. Row E contains positive controls
in E1–E8 and negative controls in E9–E12. The variants
are grown, induced to express enzyme, and treated to produce a clarified
lysate for screening. After the transamination reaction and sample
preparation (including acetonitrile precipitation of protein and plate
filtration), these samples are first analyzed on a commercial HPLC-MS
(Figure 5B). Then,
the plate is further diluted 5-fold to a final 18 v/v % ACN and reformatted
into perfluorodecalin (PFD) segmented droplets quadruplicatedly for
each sample. Although the reaction mixture contains high amount of
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) cofactor, salts,
and cell lysate proteins and surfactants that destabilize the droplets,
the plate filtration and further dilution resolve this issue, enabling
the sample droplets to be directly analyzed by MS. The raw droplet
trace of the plate is captured in Figure 5A. For a total of ∼400 droplets, the
entire assay time is 130 s, corresponding to the analysis rate of
3 Hz, whereas the HPLC-MS assay has a throughput of 4 min/sample.
Because the substrate ketone has a very low ionization efficiency
on the MS, only the product β-leucine is used to evaluate the
activities of various genes. After the data analysis, the fold improvement
of each gene is calculated by normalizing the β-leucine intensity
to the positive control. Figure 5B clearly shows that HPLC-MS and droplet–MS
produce very similar results in terms of fold improvement for each
variant and the hits identification. The high correlation (r2 = 0.95) between the two data sets validates
the reliability of the droplet–MS approach, and importantly,
is 700× faster than the LC–MS method.

data and LC–MS data.

Scheme 2 Formation of β-Leucine from Ketoester
Transaminase ATA-117 Screening
To
further establish
the robustness of the optimized droplet–MS method for analyzing
the pharmaceutical protein engineering samples, we screen a transaminase
hit plate from an earlier evolution project, as shown in Scheme 3. Previously, transaminase
ATA-117 undergoes two rounds of evolution to convert this 1-(3-(trifluoromethyl)-5,6-dihydro-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyrazin-7(8H)-yl)butane-1,3-dione (THTP-BDO)
methyl ketone to amine, and this provides a collection of variants
of improved activity (Moore et al. submitted). Thirty variants are mapped in
triplicate on a 96-well plate, including the best variant from the
initial round (wells H4–H6), the wild-type ATA-117 (wells H7–H9),
and the negative control (well H10–H12). Reactions are run
using THTP-BDO as previously described, and the screening results
are obtained from both LC–MS and droplet–MS methods.
Because both the substrate and the product have a high ionization
efficiency, the conversion is calculated based on the signal of both. Figure 6A demonstrates the
conversion data obtained from LC–MS and droplet–MS methods
are equivalent regarding the relative activities among the variants. Figure 6B also confirms the
good correlation (r2 ∼ 0.96) between
the two sets of results. The primary difference is that screening
this one plate takes 6 h using LC–MS, but it takes only 120
s to assay the same plate in quadruplicates with the droplet–MS
method—again a 700× throughput upgrade.

was used. Assay throughput was 3 Hz. (A) Comparison of the % conversion

Scheme 3 formation of Truncated Sitagliptin Amine
One-Step ivTT and Enzymatic Assay in Droplets
The two
examples above indicate that the droplet–MS method can be used
to save significant assay time when applied to industrial enzyme screening.
In this event, the throughput-limiting step in the enzyme evolution
process then shifts to protein expression and running the reaction.
The traditional cell-based protein expression approach requires cell
transformation, cell culturing, protein harvesting, and sample preparation
requiring multiple days of effort. Alternatively, cell free protein
synthesis (or ivTT) dramatically accelerates protein expression, as
it only requires mixing of the template DNA with key reagents and
incubation for 2 h.29−31 One major reason that ivTT has not been widely used
is that the reagents are expensive relative to the traditional approach.
We and others envision ivTT would find application in the droplet
format, as the reagent consumption is only a few nanoliters per sample.32,33 We test in-droplet ivTT by performing the cell free synthesis of
transaminase ATA-117 and the ketone/amine conversion using the synthesized
ATA-117 in one step. All of the ivTT components, including the ivTT
mixes, RNAse inhibitor, PLP, and DNA template, along with the reaction
substrates pyridinyl amine and pyruvate (Scheme 1) are mixed together in a well plate, and
then immediately (within 1.5 min) reformatted into the PFD-segmented
droplets and stored in the Teflon tubing for incubation. Initially,
significant droplet breakage inside the tubing is observed after only
30 min of incubation. These droplets break down further upon infusion
into the MS. We hypothesize that the interfacial tension of the droplet
and oil is weakened by the relatively high concentration of the complex
components as compared to the previous diluted samples from transaminase
screening plates. Typically, this is managed by adding surfactant
to the carrier oil, and an MS friendly oil–surfactant system
has been reported.34 After switching to
a similar oil–surfactant system (HFE 7500 with 2% fluorosurfactant,
a perfluoropolyether–poly(ethylene glycol) triblock co-polymer),
the droplets are stable even after overnight incubation and remained
stable when moving inside the tubing. The new oil–surfactant
fluid provides abundant signal and very nice stability on the MS (Figure S3). Additionally, the ESI needle is changed
to a 12 cm long 120/250 Teflon needle, which is directly inserted
into the carrier tubing with wax seal, as shown in Figure 2C. Stable spray and good droplet
traces are obtained with the help of the 30 μL/min sheath flow
(Figure S3). The optimal sheath liquid
is discovered to be 100% H2O, which matches the solvent
composition for ivTT. Based on our data, the best practice is to select
the same solvent for the sheath liquid as the sample.

With the
new oil–surfactant system in place, the one-step ivTT and enzyme
assay is revisited. An ivTT reaction designed to make ATA-117 is set
up as described in Table S1. In a positive
control reaction, we spiked in a small amount of the ATA-117 enzyme,
and in the negative control, we omitted the DNA coding for the enzyme.
Pyridinyl amine and pyruvate are used as substrates because the equilibrium
lies heavily in favor of the pyridinyl ketone and alanine (Scheme 1) and therefore no
additional enzymes for pulling the reaction forward are required. Figure 7 presents the measured
product (ketone) and substrate (amine) signals from the three reactions
incubated in droplets. The transaminase produced by ivTT is active,
similar to that of the ATA-117 standard positive control, whereas
omitting the DNA results in no reaction under identical conditions.
This successful one-step study shows that the cell free transaminase
synthesis and transaminase reaction can be performed in one step for
an overnight incubation (∼14 h). The one-step study is unaffected
by the new oil–surfactant system, this system is effective
at maintaining individual droplets without carryover, and the MS is
capable of analyzing complex ivTT reactions without an additional
sample preparation. This allows for taking advantage of the tiny volume
of droplets to save considerable reagent cost. Additionally, the identification
of the appropriate oil–surfactant system broadens the scope
of droplet–MS screening setup, as samples no longer need to
be confined to relatively clean, prepared sample plates,24 or buffer-switched reactions16 but can be employed as routine reaction vessels in a protein
engineering process.

Conclusions
With the upgraded analysis rate, robustness,
flexibility, and applicability,
we demonstrated the droplet–MS methodology as an efficient,
label-free, high-throughput screening technology for pharmaceutical
biocatalysis. Utilizing an all-Teflon fluid path, the carryover was
eliminated without losing signal stability and sensitivity. Escherichia coli expressed enzymes were screened
using the droplet–MS platform following the standard sample
preparation. Screening results of two types of transaminases by droplet–MS
were in good agreement with the LC–MS method, but with significantly
faster rate, validating the methodology as a viable high-throughput
analytical technique for industrial biocatalyst screening. The adoption
of the selected surfactant–oil carrier fluid alleviated the
droplet instability caused by complex reaction components, at the
same time sustaining a high-quality MS signal. The success of cell
free synthesis of transaminase in nanoliter droplets suggested a great
potential for accelerating the activity testing of DNA libraries in
a round of protein engineering from 3–4 weeks to within 24
h at significant cost savings compared to traditional ivTT experiments.

using an ultrapure deionized water from the Milli-Q Water Purification
System (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). The ultrapure nuclease free
water for the ivTT work was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).

Droplet
Generation From Multiwell Plates
The droplet
generation system is depicted in Figure S1A. Fluorinated oil segmented droplets were generated based on the
method described previously23 with a few
optimizations. First, the reaction samples were diluted with acetonitrile
(ACN) and H2O, both containing 0.1% formic acid to make
the final ACN concentration ∼20%. The diluted sample solutions
were filtered through a filter plate (0.45 μm filter, EMD Millipore,
Billerica, MA) to remove the precipitates. The diluted samples were
then loaded onto the treated multiwell plate (using Teflon aerosol).
Next, this plate was placed in a custom three-dimensional-printed
plate holder (Figure S1B) with raised edges
around the plate to hold an extra layer of perfluorodecalin (PFD)
oil. After the oil was placed on top of each sample and the whole
plate, the sample droplets were sipped into a 250 μm i.d., 1600
μm o.d. (250/1600) carrier Teflon tubing (IDEX Health and Science,
Oak Harbor, WA), which was connected to a 500 μL syringe (Hamilton
Robotics, Reno, NV). The syringe was mounted on a PHD 2000 syringe
pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) and set to withdraw at 2 μL/min.
On the open inlet of the 250/1600 carrier Teflon tubing, a 2 cm long,
120 μm i.d., 250 μm o.d. (120/250) thin Teflon tubing
(Zeus Industrial Products, Inc., Orangeburg, SC) was inserted in and
sealed with capillary wax (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA) to function
as a “sipper” (Figure 2A). Before the droplets generation, the syringe and
the tubing were prefilled with PFD. To sample the whole plate into
droplets in an array, a computer numerical control device (purchased
from Zen Toolworks, Concord, CA, and custom assembled according to
the provided instructions) was used as the XYZ positioner. The carrier
Teflon tubing was mounted on the Z head and the XYZ positioner was
programmed to reformat the desired number of droplets from screening
plates with the desired size.

ESI-MS Detection of Sample
Droplets
Before screening
the enzymatic reaction samples, the droplet–MS conditions were
optimized using pyridinyl amine and pyridinyl ketone standards (Scheme 1). Consequently,
the amount of ketone and amine in each sample were measured to evaluate
the activity of the transaminase. An Agilent MS-6120A (Santa Clara,
CA) single-quadrupole mass spectrometer was used for droplet analysis.
The regular ESI source with the stainless steel (SS) ESI needle was
replaced with a CE–MS ESI source (Figure S1C,D), which has similar configuration as the traditional
ESI source, but allows direct insertion of a 12 cm long, 150 μm
i.d., 360 μm o.d. (150/360), or 120/250 thin Teflon tubing as
the ESI needle and with the capability of introducing sheath flow
to the spray. The entire fluid path is shown in Figure 2B,C. Once generation of droplets was finished,
the small Teflon sipper was removed and the open end of the droplet
carrier tubing was connected to the 150/360 Teflon ESI needle through
a PEEK zero dead volume union (Valco Instruments Co. Inc., Houston,
TX) or by the direct insertion of a 120/250 Teflon needle. For analysis,
the same syringe pump was used to infuse the droplets into the ESI
source at 15–20 μL/min. Positive ESI mode was used with
voltage set at 3 kV. The nebulizing gas flow pressure was 35 psig,
and the temperature of transferring capillary was 250 °C. Selected
ion monitoring mode was used to measure the MS signals for the substrate
and product from each reaction.

Droplet Data Analysis
Droplet traces were analyzed
using ChemStation (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Absolute abundance (peak
height) of the substrate and the product was correlated to the concentration.
The peak height information of each droplet was exported to Excel
(Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). The list of peaks was automatically
assigned back to each well on the 96-well plates using Excel based
on the different oil spacing (reflected as different numbers of MS
data points) within the replicates of each sample, between samples,
and between rows. The averaged peak height of replicated droplets
for each sample was used for calculation. The % conversion was calculated
as the percentage of the peak height of the product over the sum of
the peak heights of the product and the substrate. The fold improvement
was calculated as the peak height of the product of each variant over
that of the positive control sample. All of the calculations were
performed with Excel.

Enzyme Variant Construction, Expression,
Lysis, and Reaction
The ATA-036 transaminase variants were
constructed by a single
site-directed mutagenesis of a C-terminus 6xHis tag variant of the
ATA-036 enzyme, a hit selected as a part of sitagliptin evolution
work.8 To perturb the activity of the enzyme,
84 variants containing single mutations within 10 Å of the ATA
binding pocket were selected. These variants were cloned into an expression
vector containing a p15A-based replication origin, chloramphenicol
antibiotic resistance marker, and an IPTG-inducible promoter.8 The final plasmids were transformed into an E. coli W3110 mutant.8 The enzyme variants, eight replicates of the positive control (ATA-036),
and three replicates of a negative control (that expresses β-lactamase
instead of ATA-036) were grown overnight at 30 °C and 200 rpm
in a NUNC 96-well microplate filled with 160 μL LB media supplemented
with 35 ng/μL chloramphenicol and 1% glucose. 10 μL cells
from each well was then subcultured into 390 μL terrific broth
(TB) media supplemented with 35 ng/μL chloramphenicol and 100
μM pyridoxine, and grown at 30 °C and 250 rpm. After 3
h, 1 mM IPTG was added and the cells were grown for another 18 h.
The cells were harvested by centrifugations at 4000 rpm and the cell
pellets were stored at −80 °C until ready for lysis. The
cell lysis step was initiated by preparing a fresh lysis buffer containing
0.25 mg/mL lysozyme, 100 mM TEoA, pH 7.5, 0.2 mg/mL polymyxin B sulfate,
and 100 μM pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP). 200 μL of the
lysis buffer was added to cell pellets and the lysis reaction mixture
was incubated for 2 h at room temperature and 1000 rpm. The lysis
mixture was then centrifuged at 4000 rpm and 60 μL of the supernatant
was added to 140 μL of a reaction master mix such that the final
reaction contains 20 g/L methyl 4-methyl-3-oxopentanoate (ketoester, Scheme 2), 18 vol % DMSO,
50 vol % of a buffer composed of 0.2 M borate and 1.5 M iPrNH2, 1 g/L PLP, and 30 vol % ATA-036 lysate. The reaction was
run overnight at 60 °C and 800 rpm then quenched by the addition
of 200 μL of acetonitrile (ACN), followed by a 5-fold dilution
with 10% ACN/H2O for the subsequent droplet–MS analysis.

To vary the activity of ATA-117, a library of 32 variants were
selected from our previous study (Moore et al. submitted) cloned into
a pD451 expression vector (ATUM, formerly DNA2.0) and the final plasmids
were transformed into an E. coli BL21
(DE3) strain. Glycerol stocks of these variants were prepared by the
addition of glycerol to overnight cultures of these variants in LB
media supplemented with 50 ng/μL Kanamycin. To express this
library, each variant was grown overnight in the LB-Kanamycin media
at 37 °C. 10 μL from each sample was subcultured into 400
μL of Super broth (SB) media supplemented with 50 ng/μL
Kanamycin. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C and 250 rpm for
3 h. Then, the protein expression was induced by the addition of 40 μL
IPTG (10 mM). The induced cells were incubated at 37 °C, 250
rpm for 4 h. Finally, the cells were collected by centrifuging the
culture at 4000 rpm for 10 min and discarding the supernatant. The
cells were stored at −80 °C before the lysis step. The
lysis buffer composed of 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl,
1 mg/mL lysozyme, and 25 U/μL endonuclease. 50 μL of the
lysis solution was added to each sample, and the lysis mixture was
incubated at 4 °C and 750 rpm. Finally, after centrifugation
at 4000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant containing the expressed enzyme
was collected. A reaction stock solution containing 0.5 g/L PLP, 0.1
g/L lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 0.5 g/L glucose dehydrogenase (GDH),
0.25 g/L NAD, 1 M d-alanine, 0.5 M glucose, 0.1 M Na2HPO4 (pH 7.0), and 10 mg/mL truncated sitagliptin
ketone (Scheme 3) was
prepared. Each reaction was set up by the addition of 10 μL
cell lysate to 90 μL of the reaction stock. The final reaction
mixture was incubated overnight at 30 °C and 450 rpm and then
quenched by the addition of 100 μL ACN.

In Vitro Transcription–Translation
(ivTT) Reaction in
Droplets
For reactions of ivTT-synthesized transaminase with
pyridinyl amine (Scheme 1), a reaction stock solution composed of 250 mM pyridinyl amine and
250 mM pyruvate was prepared before assembling the ivTT reaction.
Cell free transaminase synthesis was performed using PURExpress in
vitro protein synthesis kit. Two solutions, A and B, reconstituted
from the purified components necessary for E. coli translation, were provided from the kit. Following the protocol
for a 200 μL reaction, 80 μL of solution A, and 60 μL
of solution B were added sequentially in a nuclease free microfuge
tube placed on ice. Next, 4 μL RNAse inhibitor (40 000
units/mL) and 8 μL PLP (2.5 mM) were added to the mixture. Then,
36 μL of the nuclease free water and 12 μL plasmid DNA
(TA-pD451, 300 ng/μL) were added into the mixture. After all
of the ivTT components were added, 180 μL ivTT reaction solution
was taken and added with 20 μL substrate stock solution. The
positive control reaction contained the same components except that
expressed ATA-117 standard replaced the plasmid DNA. The negative
control contained neither ATA-117 standard nor its DNA, thus no conversion
was expected (Table S1). The final mixtures
of ivTT reaction, positive control, and the negative control were
immediately sampled (∼1.5 min after mixing) into droplets and
then stored in a 250/1600 Teflon tubing. Once sampling was finished,
both ends of the tubing were sealed with capillary wax and placed
in the 37 °C incubator overnight (∼14 h).

HPLC-MS Analysis
For the plate-based transaminase screening,
the reactions on the 96-well plates were also analyzed with the Agilent
HPLC-MS system as a comparison to the droplet–MS results. For Scheme 2 with ATA-036, after
the sample preparation, the samples were injected onto a HPLC column
(Zwix (−) 100 mm × 3 mm, 3 μm particle size) with
a separation time of 4 min. Selected ion monitoring (SIM) signals
of β-leucine (m/z 132) were
measured. For Scheme 3 with ATA-117, the samples were injected onto the same column with
a separation time of 3.5 min. Selected ion monitoring (SIM) signals
of truncated sitagliptin ketone and amine (m/z 277 and m/z 278, respectively)
were measured.
