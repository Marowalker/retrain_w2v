Mapping
different structural forms of serotonin subtypes 5-HT1A–5-HT7 using a selective-specific ligand
with good pharmacokinetics and brain permeability can open avenues
for personalized medication in depressed population. Herein, the selective
5-HT1A/7 antagonist, modified for enhanced brain permeation,
is developed as a homobivalent ligand, (6-AcBTZ)2DTPA.
After in-depth computational studies to probe the binding mechanism,
two-step synthesis lead to (6-AcBTZ)2DTPA. Biocompatibility
studies indicated cytocompatibility with 3.6–1.64% cell death
(0.1 mM–1 pM) and hemocompatibility with 2.33% hemolysis of
human erythrocytes. When 99mTc-radiolabeled in a quantitative
yield (98%), a stable preparation was obtained with 7.4 and 3.5% dissociation
upon incubation with human serum and excess cysteine. The single-photon-emission
computed tomography (SPECT) tracer 99mTc-(6-AcBTZ)2DTPA showed biphasic clearance (t1/2,
distribution = 0.5 min and t1/2, elimination = 482 min) and maximum brain uptake of 0.42 ± 0.02% ID/g with
the regional localization (hippocampus: 11.38% ID/g; cortex: 26.42%
ID/g; cerebellum: 25.23% ID/g). Thus, the 99mTc-metal-based
SPECT neurotracer holds potential for neuroreceptor mapping.

Introduction
There is a growing
concern related to the increasing share of neurological
disorders leading to the disability in population and associated emotional-financial
burden on the society.1 Depression and
anxiety are among the most common psychological consequences of neurological
disorders, and when unmanaged, these bear a detrimental effect on
the treatment management of a neurological disorder.2 Biochemically, depression and anxiety involve a complex
interplay of neurotransmitters and neuroreceptors. The most popular
theory of depression, “the monoamine hypothesis”, postulates
that the reduction of serotonin transmission forms the underlying
basis for depression. Thus, the theory brings a serotonergic pathway
as the key target in the management of depression. The reduction of
serotonergic signal transmission can be attributed to depletion of
serotonin neurotransmitters or other mechanisms involving serotonin
receptors such as alterations in receptor distribution and impaired
receptor function.3,4 The role of serotonin receptors,
particularly the subtype 5-HT1A, is well established as
a modulator of various physiological functions and highly implicated
in depression and anxiety.3−5 A report summarizing postmortem
analysis of depressed models indicates (1) decreased density and affinity
of 5-HT1A receptors in the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex
of depressed/stressed suicide victims and (2) reduced gene expression
of 5-HT1A receptors in the receptor-rich regions in patients
with no or on different antidepressant treatment regimens.4 Not surprisingly, 5-HT1A has been
the key target for designing antidepressants and anxiolytics.4−7 Another subtype of 5-HT receptors discovered recently and speculated
to have central role in depression is 5-HT7.6,7 The antidepressant-like behavior induced in animal models after
blockading the 5-HT7 receptor and the high affinity of
antidepressants, for example, the tricyclics and selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-based ligands, toward 5-HT7 has
lead researchers to consider the 5-HT7 receptor as a therapeutic
target for depression.6−8 Emerging reports also point to the interplay and
cross-talk of 5-HT1A with 5-HT7 in the prognosis
of the disorders, although the exact mechanisms of action are yet
to be established.7,9,10 These
are highly coexpressed as homodimers (5-HT1A–5-HT1A and 5-HT7–5-HT7) and heterodimers
(5-HT1A–5-HT7) both in vitro and in vivo,
as seen in Förster Resonance Energy Transfer and coimmunoprecipitation
studies.9,10 In depression and anxiety, modulation of
receptor signaling by heterodimerization plays an important role.
It is hypothesized that, under normal physiology, the density of postsynaptic
dimeric 5-HT1A receptors is dominant.9 However, in depression or anxiety, the increased presynaptic
5-HT1A–5-HT7 heterodimers over the postsynaptic
receptor density may alter the 5-HT1A expression, thereby
affecting the feedback mechanism and, ultimately, the serotonin signaling.9,10 Overall, the heterodimers play a crucial role in maintaining 5-HT1A-mediated signaling and internalization under pathological
conditions. The new treatment strategy for depression using designed
multiple ligands proposes the antagonism of 5-HT1A/7 receptors.6−8

Considering the influence of dimerization on receptor-mediated
signaling, quantification of dimeric receptors has become the most
studied pharmacological mark for the diagnosis or treatment of depression/anxiety.
Receptor mapping using molecular imaging, namely, positron emission
tomography (PET) and single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT)
modalities, can provide information related to functional occupancy,
structural forms, and distribution of neuroreceptors.8,11−14 The success relies on the selectivity of the receptor-targeted imaging
probes (radioligands). Targeting dimeric receptors requires ligands
with two units of pharmacophore separated by an optimum linker length.15,16 Such ligands conform to the bivalent ligand approach coined by Portoghese
et al.17,18 This approach has been extensively validated
for designing selective and specific ligands for δ-κ (opioid),
δ-μ (opioid), δ-CB1 (opioid-cannabinoid1),
CXCR4 (chemokine), and 5-HT1A and 5-HT4 (serotonin)
receptors.19−24 Similar endeavors have been efficiently employed by our own group
for dimeric 5-HT1A receptors, wherein the ligand binds
to the dimeric receptor through bivalent interactions and thus enhances
selective drug actions.22,23 However, reports for
bivalent ligand for dimeric receptors of 5-HT are a handful, with
major emphasis on selectivity only for 5-HT1A receptors.
As per our knowledge, there has been no report on the development
of molecular probes for 5-HT7 dimers, although molecular
probes for monomeric receptors exist. Prominent examples for molecular
imaging of monomeric 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 are [11C]WAY100635, [18F]MPPF, [18F]FCWAY,
[11C]trans-MeFWAY, [18F]BMPPSiF,
and [68Ga]DO3A-butyl-MPP and [18F]2FP3, [11C]DR4446, [11C]CIMBI 717, and biaryl derivatives,
respectively.14

A majority of the
probes are PET-based probes radiolabeled using 11C or 18F. The on-site production, short half-life
(11C, 18F), and the complex chemistry required
to develop a PET radiopharmaceutical limit its adoption despite providing
a higher resolution for receptor imaging. On the other hand, metal-based
radiotracers offer functional and economic versatility. Pre-eminent
metal-based radionuclides (99mTc (SPECT) and 68Ga (PET)) are generator-based, which allows elution of radionuclides
on an as-needed basis. Second, since the principles of targeting and
metal loading remain the same, the same ligand can be used for SPECT,
PET, and even MRI or optical imaging by merely changing the metal
ion that is compatible with the chelator. Among the polyamino-polycarboxylic
acyclic chelators, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) has been
the choice due to fast and high yielding radiolabeling. Despite the
advantages, only a few metal-based radioprobes, especially for neuroreceptors,
have been successful, with 99mTc-TRODAT for dopamine transporters
being the prominent example.12 Following
a similar pursuit, the presented work was focused on the design and
synthesis of a metal-labeled radioligand for targeting a dimeric system
of 5-HT1A–5-HT7 receptors using the bivalent
ligand approach and validation through SPECT imaging. The ligand has
been investigated for its receptor binding, biocompatibility, stability,
and neuroimaging applications using computational and biological evaluations.
Receptor distribution and affinity of the synthesized radioligand
were established via regional localization and radioligand binding
studies.

Results and Discussion
Ligand Design and Development
Choice of
the Pharmacophore
The structural similarity
between 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptors has showed
cross-reactivity among the ligands synthesized for these receptors.25 Among the various heterocyclic pharmacophores
reported for 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptors, benzothiazolone
(BTZ) derivatives gave the highest selectivity and affinity, owing
to their ability to form H-bonding and side-chain hydrophobic interactions
with these receptors through carbonyl oxygen and the BTZ ring.23,26−28 Recently, our research group has developed a BTZ-based
homobivalent ligand, 99mTc-(BTZ)2DTPA, with
a binding affinity of nanomolar concentration for 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptors.23 Following
the lead, in this work, we chose a substituted BTZ pharmacophore to
design a high-affinity ligand. We selected a 3,6-disubstituted BTZ
scaffold originally reported by Taverne et al. and Mouithys-Mickalad
et al. for 5-HT1A receptors.29,30 So far, prominent
disubstituted modifications of 6-acyl/sulfonyl/alkyl-3-aryl/alkyl-2(3H)-BTZ have been carried out with end applications for selective
5-HT1A, 5-HT6, D2, and σ1 receptor-targeting ligands, yet no ligand has been synthesized
for 5-HT7 receptors (Figure 1).29−34 Promising results in terms of better receptor binding, radioligand
localization in specific brain regions, and antianxiety, antipsychotic,
and anticonvulsant properties were quoted for 6-acyl-3-alkyl-2(3H)-BTZ derivatives. Considering the metabolic stability
of acetyl functionality in human serum, thereby increasing the circulation
time and high receptor-binding affinities of 3-alkylamine-BTZ derivatives,
we modified the 6- and 3-positions of 6-acyl-3-alkyl-2(3H)-BTZ scaffold with 6-acetyl and 3-propylamine functionalities, where
the terminal 3-alkylamine group would further conjugate with the DTPA
chelator to facilitate bivalent ligand binding. As the ligands synthesized
for 5-HT1A–5-HT7 receptors show cross-reactivity,
we expect the designed bivalent ligand to exhibit selectivity and
high affinity for the targeted serotonin receptor subtypes. DTPA-conjugated
6-acetyl-3-propyl-2(3H)-BTZ ((6-AcBTZ)2DTPA) is the first bivalent ligand that has a different scaffold
from the other reported 5-HT1A–5-HT7 receptor
radioligands, so we believe that the evaluations performed with this
ligand may set up beneficial information about 5-HT1A–5-HT7 receptor binding.

derivatives reported
for (B, C) 5-HT1A, (E) 5-HT6, (B) D2, and (A, C, D) σ1 receptors.

Pharmacophore Arrangement
Since our aim was to develop
a bivalent ligand using a modified pharmacophore, we had to optimize
two parameters: (i) the end-to-end ligand distances of the two units
of the pharmacophores in the bivalent ligand and (ii) the position
of the acetyl group in the modified pharmacophore, which can influence
the receptor binding affinity of a ligand by modifying binding interactions.
Based on the reports of bivalent ligands for receptor targeting,19−24 we exploited DTPA as both the chelator and linker. To ascertain
the position and relative affinities of acetyl functionalization in
BTZ, an in silico library of four compounds was generated and evaluated.
The calculated end-to-end distance of designed ligands was found in
the range of 21–26 Å, indicating good dimeric receptor-bridging
ability (Figure 2).
The relation between the position of acetyl substitution and binding
affinity of individual ligands was analyzed by performing docking
studies onto the monomeric and homo- and heterodimeric receptor models,
and the relative affinities were determined on the basis of G-Score
values (Table 1). Postdocking
analysis of receptor–ligand complexes provided receptor–ligand
interactions and the relative orientations of the ligands in the binding
grooves of monomeric and dimeric receptors (see the Supporting Information).

Docking
with the Heterodimeric 5-HT1A–5-HT7 Receptor
Model
Among the four designed ligands,
molecule 2 showed the highest binding in the 5-HT1A (G-Score
= −2.8) and 5-HT7 (G-Score = −5.0) pockets.
Molecule 1 interacted with the amino acid residues of ECL2 (extra
cellular loop 2) via H-bond and salt bridges in the 5-HT1A binding pocket. Albeit acquiring a U-shape orientation, molecule
1 could not bind properly as the two acetyl groups at the 7-position
prohibited it to enter into the binding pocket. Likewise, it could
also not bind to the 5-HT7 binding pocket. The N-terminal
residues along with the three ECLs (ECL1–ECL3) of the 5-HT7 receptor unit gripped molecule 1 in the ECL region, which
forbid it to reach the binding groove, and thus indicated low binding.
Unlike molecule 1, the presence of acetyl groups at the 6-position
in molecule 2 facilitated its binding to both binding pockets. Residues
Lys191 and Leu380 interacted with the proton of the −NH2 group and oxygen of the −COOH group of DTPA in the
5-HT1A binding pocket, whereas residues Arg350, Gln235,
Asn226, and Phe343 interacted through H-bonding with carbonyl oxygen
of the BTZ ring, the −COOH group of DTPA, acetyl group, the
proton of −CONH, and the π–π stacking with
the two aromatic rings of BTZ moiety in the 5-HT7 binding
pocket. These interactions suggested better binding of molecule 2.
Molecule 3 showed an analogous trend to that of molecule 1. It was
oriented in a distorted U-shape conformation with BTZ rings projected
in the opposite direction. The H-bond (Asn226, Arg350, Gln235), salt
bridge (Arg350), π–cation (Phe237), and π–π
stacking (Phe343) interactions were observed with the O-atom of the
acetyl group, BTZ, carboxylate oxygen, the protonated tertiary N-atom
of DTPA, and the thiazolone ring of BTZ moiety. These interactions
together pulled the bulky molecule deeper inside the binding groove,
resulting into a strained conformation of the receptor–ligand
complex. The small-size cavity further enhanced postcomplexation conformational
strain, which leads to low binding of molecule 3. Molecule 4 gave
resembling interactions as noted for molecule 3. The only H-bond interaction
was with Thr288 via carbonyl oxygen of the BTZ ring, suggesting a
low G-Score value for 5-HT1A binding. A further reduced
G-Score value of −0.8 noted for the 5-HT7 pocket
indicated a lack of interactions necessary for better binding. Overall,
molecule 2 showed better binding.

Docking with Homodimeric
5-HT1A–5-HT7 Receptor Models
Molecules 1 and 2 were binding better at
the two binding pockets as compared to molecules 3 and 4, which could
only bind at one of the pockets in the homodimers despite obtaining
higher G-Score values as compared to molecules 1 and 2. When docked
with monomeric 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptor models,
binding of molecule 2 was found best with G-Score values of −5.1
and −6.3, respectively. Additionally, binding of molecule 2
was congruent with reference ligands SB-269970 and WAY-100635 (data
not shown), which further suggested the potent nature of molecule
2. The respective 2D and 3D ligand interaction diagrams (LIDs) are
provided in the Supporting Information.

Docking with Technetium Complex of 2
As
molecule 2 showed better binding for targeted receptors and our ultimate
aim was to load the ligand with metal radionuclide 99mtechnetium,
it was further complexed with technetium to analyze any post-metal
complexation variation. The DFT-optimized Tc-(6-AcBTZ)2DTPA complex (Figure 3) was docked analogously onto the dimeric and monomeric 5-HT1A–5-HT7 receptors. A majority of the interactions
of (6-AcBTZ)2DTPA and Tc-(6-AcBTZ)2DTPA were
found identical in all the receptor systems (Table 2). This suggested no considerable change
in the binding upon metal complexation (see the Supporting Information). In addition, we observed increased
G-Score values with homodimeric 5-HT1A–5-HT1A and 5-HT7–5-HT7 receptors,
namely, from −4.0 to −4.3 and −5.6 to −7.2,
respectively. Similarly, binding with heterodimeric 5-HT1A–5-HT7 receptors was also enhanced upon technetium
complexation with the increased G-Score values from −2.8 to
−3.6 and −5.0 to −5.1 in the binding pockets
of 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptors, respectively
(see the Supporting Information). These
results encouraged molecule 2 as the best found ligand, and so, it
was synthesized and radiolabeled for further evaluations.

Chemistry
The
ligand (6-AcBTZ)2DTPA was
synthesized as shown in Scheme 1. Briefly, 6-acetylbenzothiazole was reacted with 3-bromopropylamine
hydrochloride in an equimolar amount to yield the primary amine intermediate.
The amine was precipitated as its hydrochloride salt and characterized
as such using spectroscopic techniques. The appearance of NMR signals
at δH 1.97–2.06, 3.24–3.29, 3.90–3.94
(−CH2), 4.03–4.07 (−NH2), 7.13–7.16, and 7.72–7.75 ppm (aromatic −CH)
suggested product formation. The HPLC-purified amine and DTPA dianhydride
were then reacted in 2:1 molar ratio in the presence of triethylamine
(pH 8.0) in inert conditions to yield the desired bis-conjugated bivalent
ligand (6-AcBTZ)2DTPA. It was then precipitated using chilled
ether and further purified using HPLC to give the final product in
91–92% yield. The disappearance of amine protons (4.03–4.07
ppm) and the appearance of signals at 2.44–3.45 ppm for methylene
protons of DTPA confirmed the desired product. UV–Vis data
showed a broad peak in the wavelength range of 260–330 nm,
indicating the successful conjugation of amine to DTPA. The broadened
absorption was attributed to the overlapping of π–π*
transition of amide (220–260 nm) and carbonyl groups of 6-acetylbenzothiazolone
moiety (280–320 nm), giving rise to mixed energy levels upon
excitation in the wavelength range of 250–400 nm (Figure 4a).35 Lower protonation constants were observed for the synthesized
bivalent ligand as compared to DTPA,36 which
suggested fast ionization and quick delivery of acidic protons in
the aqueous solution and thus promoted an adequate metal complexation
of the ligand (Figure 4b).

titration of the (6-AcBTZ)2DTPA ligand.

Biocompatibility
MTT Assay
No cellular cytotoxicity was noted in the
concentration range of 0.1 mM–1 pM on the normal HEK-293 cell
line. The maximum cell death at this concentration range was only
3.6 to 1.64% with reference to control (24 h). The extended follow-up
(48 and 72 h) in the similar concentration range resulted in cell
death in the range of 6.52 to 3.69% and 6.64 to 17.98%, respectively
(Figure 5a). We observed
optimum percent cell viability even upon extended drug treatment,
suggesting a substantial biocompatible window of this ligand for its
useful application in medical imaging.

and pharmacokinetics studies: (a)
MTT assay and (b) hemolysis study, (c) radiolabeling efficiency in
saline, (d) cysteine challenge test, (e) human serum stability test,
and (f) blood kinetics evaluation studies.

Hemocompatibility
The blood compatibility of the synthesized
ligand is essential for diagnostic purposes as a majority of the imaging
agents are administered intravenously, and so, the hemocompatibility
was analyzed by performing hemolysis study on fresh human blood samples.
A transparent and achromatic supernatant indicated no hemolytic effects
or erythrocyte destruction upon incubation with the ligand (6-AcBTZ)2DTPA. Hemoglobin measurements at 540 nm for the developed
ligand showed only 2.33% erythrocyte destruction until 4 h, suggesting
no appreciable hemolytic effects, which, in turn, indicate no influence
on the structure of biomembranes, thereby ensuring a discernible compatibility
with blood cells (Figure 5b).37

Radiolabeling and Optimization
of Stability Parameters
The synthesized ligand was radiolabeled
with Na[99mTcO4] (pertechnetate) using the direct
radiolabeling method, wherein
pertechnetate was reduced with an acidic SnCl2 solution
(pH 7.4) to obtain a maximum radiolabeling efficiency. Radiolabeling
parameters, namely, incubation time, SnCl2 concentration,
and pH of labeling, were optimized to ensure maximum radioconjugation
of the (6-AcBTZ)2DTPA ligand into the 99mTc-(6-AcBTZ)2DTPA radioligand (see the Supporting Information). Optimum radiolabeling was achieved using 100 μg/mL SnCl2 (pH = 6.5 ± 0.3) at 10 min of incubation. The biological
stability of 99mTc-(6-AcBTZ)2DTPA was estimated
under physiological conditions. When incubated with saline, 99mTc-(6-AcBTZ)2DTPA was found stable for up to 24 h, with
a maximum radiochemical purity of 98–99% respectively (Figure 5c). The radioligand
was further incubated with a freshly prepared human serum sample at
physiological conditions to determine its in vitro stability, where
we found it stable for up to 24 h with only 7.4% dissociation of the
radiolabeled compound (Figure 5e). The trans-complexation stability was
also evaluated by challenging 99mTc-(6-AcBTZ)2DTPA with cysteine (25–100 mM). The radioligand exhibited
only 0.72, 2.35, and 3.53% trans-complexation of 99mTc-radioisotope
upon challenging it with 25, 50, and 100 mM concentrations of cysteine,
respectively. Approximately 96% radioactivity was found intact to
the radioconjugate even after the 2 h challenge test with 100 mM cysteine
at 37 °C (Figure 5d).

Pharmacokinetics
Longer blood residence time due to
nonspecific interactions of the radioligand with blood components
has been an interfering parameter in the development of an effective
radiopharmaceutical for medical imaging purposes. Thus, to understand
the blood clearance pattern of 99mTc-(6-AcBTZ)2DTPA, blood kinetics experiment was conducted. Quick washout of the
radioligand was noted as 87.84 ± 0.42% of the administered radioactivity
washed out from circulation within 30 min post injection (p.i.). Only
4.87 ± 0.22 and 2.05 ± 0.06% radioactivity values were retained
in the circulation after 3 and 24 h respectively, reflecting biphasic
clearance with the biological half-lives of t1/2, fast = 0.5 min and t1/2, slow = 8 h and 2 min (or 482 min, Figure 5f).

BBB Permeability
Targeting a neuroreceptor
in the central
nervous system requires permeation through the blood–brain
barrier (BBB). Brain permeability of a molecule is governed by various
parameters, with lipophilicity of the molecule being one of the major
determinants. The lipophilicity of a molecule can be determined with
the help of octanol–water partition coefficient (log Po/w). Ideally, molecules with log P values of 1.0–3.5 may be better able to show BBB permeability
and high brain uptake, although exceptions exist.38 The theoretical log P values calculated
from MolInspiration and Schrödinger tools were −1.93
and −2.10, respectively, whereas experimental log P was found to be −0.36 at pH 7.4. The negative log P is attributed to the highly hydrophilic nature of the
DTPA linker due to the presence of carboxylic groups. An additional
increment in the value of log P was observed upon
radiolabeling with 99mTc at physiological pH, which was
found to be 0.58 (average of three experiments) somewhat lower than
the ideal range. Log P is one of the predictive criteria
for efficient BBB permeation; therefore, it may not always be predictive
of positive in vivo brain uptake.39 The
increase in log P is credited to the formation of
a new chemical entity with distinct pharmacological profile after
radiolabeling, with reference to the original molecule.22 However, the log P of acetylated
derivative was less than the non-acetylated 99mTc-(BTZ)2DTPA analog (log P = 1.19),23 as earlier reported by our group for 5-HT1A–5-HT7 receptors. This attributed from the hydrophilic contribution
of the acetyl group present in 99mTc-(6-AcBTZ)2DTPA as compared to the non-acetylated 99mTc-(BTZ)2DTPA radiopharmaceutical.

Preclinical Evaluations
In Vivo
Dynamic SPECT Imaging
The brain penetration,
distribution, and clearance through various organs of the developed
radiotracer were analyzed by dynamic SPECT scans of normal New Zealand
rabbits. Images analyzed after 30 min p.i. (on-bed injection) showed
brain uptake as early as 60 s p.i. The maximum brain uptake was obtained
within 2 min p.i., which retained until 4 min p.i. following a slow
washout, suggesting no non-specific binding or a noticeable retention
in the normal brain (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Dynamic SPECT scan and time–activity curve of 99mTc-(6-AcBTZ)2DTPA.

Biodistribution Studies
The SPECT scan observations
were then corroborated through the biodistribution studies, where
radioactivity accumulation was expressed as the percentage of injected
radioactivity dose/gram of the tissues. The highest brain accumulation
of 0.42 ± 0.02% ID/g was noted at 15 min p.i., which was found
comparable to the well-known metal-based radiotracer 99mTc-TRODAT-1 (dopamine transporters; brain uptake: 0.40% ID/g).12 Other promising 99mTc-labeled radiopharmaceuticals
have also shown brain uptake in the 0.2–1.4% ID/g range.13 The uptake of 1.10 ± 0.04% ID/g at 30 min
p.i. relative to 3.19 ± 0.14% ID/g at 2 min p.i. in blood indicated
a high blood pool activity along with a quick washout analogous to
the observations of the pharmacokinetics experiment. The heart uptake
of 2.54 ± 0.11% ID/g at 2 min p.i. is attributed to distribution
and regulation of 5-HT1A–5-HT7 receptors
in circadian rhythm; thus, subsequent binding of the compound was
observed in the heart.40−45 The activity accumulation in the lungs, intestine, stomach, and
spleen is credited to the peripheral expression of these serotonin
receptor subtypes in the non-neuronal tissues of these organs.40−45 Major activity uptake of 20.14 ± 0.91, 18.89 ± 0.77, 15.96
± 0.53, 15.31 ± 0.62, and 14.20 ± 0.58% ID/g and 8.32
± 0.34, 6.33 ± 0.27, 6.20 ± 0.27, 6.04 ± 0.24,
and 5.15 ± 0.21% ID/g were observed in the liver and kidney,
respectively, at 2, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min p.i. The highest radioactivity
accumulation observed in the liver followed by kidney indicated the
lipophilic nature of the synthesized compound. It also suggested the
combined hepatobiliary-renal excretion mode for the radiotracer partly
due to the coexisting lipophilic–hydrophilic nature of the
acetyl-substituted acid-conjugated biomolecule (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Biodistribution studies of 99mTc-(6-AcBTZ)2DTPA.

Regional Uptake Studies
The specific localization of
the 99mTc-(6-AcBTZ)2DTPA radioligand was evaluated
using regional brain uptake studies in the post-mortem brain of female
Balb/c mice. The regional uptake of the intravenous (i.v.) administered
radiotracer was expressed as % ID/g of brain regions in comparison
to the total brain uptake. Appreciated regional activity accumulation
in the hippocampus (11.38%, 30 min p.i.), cortex (26.42%, 15 min p.i.),
and cerebellum (25.23%, 15 min p.i.) indicated specific localization
of the radioligand in 5-HT1A–5-HT7 receptor-rich
regions of the brain (Figure 8a).40−47 Persistence in hippocampal, cortical, and cerebral regions was observed
for up to 30 min p.i., which indicated high affinity for the 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptors. The Kd values were 0.75 and 6.59 nM, respectively, for the 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptors. Binding with the striatum
and the rest of brain regions was accredited to nonspecific binding
and tissue heterogeneity, which was substantiated by a decline of
activity accumulation in these regions. The selective binding toward
targeted receptors was further justified by achieving 4.25-, 8.07-,
and 17.10-fold maximum radiotracer accumulation in the hippocampus,
cortex, and cerebellum at 30, 10, and 2 min p.i., respectively, with
respect to the striatum (Figure 8b). Significant brain/blood ratio of 0.33 (30 min p.i.)
indicated brain penetration, as has been supported by SPECT images
and the biodistribution observations, which exhibited a noticeable
permeation through BBB and brain uptake of 99mTc-(6-AcBTZ)2DTPA.

of 99mTc-(6-AcBTZ)2DTPA.

Conclusions
A homobivalent radioligand
was developed using structure-based
drug design methodology. The influence of substitution position of
the acetyl group on the BTZ pharmacophore was analyzed via receptor–ligand
interactions with dimeric and monomeric 5-HT1A–5-HT7 receptor forms. Biocompatibility and stability of ligand
in the unlabeled and 99mTc-labeled forms were analyzed
thoroughly. BBB permeation (log P = 0.58) of 99mTc-(6-AcBTZ)2DTPA was noted in SPECT scans. The
synthesized radiotracer showed comparable maximum brain uptake to
that of well-reported and clinically used metallo-radiopharmaceutical 99mTc-TRODAT-1, suggesting promising candidature for nuclear
medicine imaging applications. Optimum radioactivity accumulation
observed in receptor-rich regions showed significant brain uptake
and specific localization of the homobivalent radiotracer for the
targeted receptors. We introduced acetylation to have metabolic stability
in human serum, increased circulation time, and high receptor-binding
affinities. However, we observed reduced total brain accumulation
(0.42 ± 0.02% ID/g) for the acetylated 99mTc-(6-AcBTZ)2DTPA radiotracer as compared to the non-acetylated 99mTc-(BTZ)2DTPA (2.08 ± 0.08% ID/g) radiopharmaceutical,
which occurred due to the decreased lipophilicity, as indicated in
log P. We also observed a difference in the regional
uptake for the acetylated radiotracer (hippocampus: 11.38% ID/g; cortex:
26.42% ID/g) as compared to the non-acetylated radiotracer23 (hippocampus: 41.83% ID/g; cortex: 23.56% ID/g).
Nevertheless, lower BBB permeation and decreased brain uptake emphasize
on further structural modifications for this radiotracer.

Experimental
Section
In Silico Studies
The molecular docking studies were
carried using Schrödinger software suite.48 The studies were mainly centered on identifying the structure-based
receptor–ligand interactions and corresponding binding affinities
in the active sites of the 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptors.
The homology models of 5-HT1A–5-HT7 receptors
were generated using the well-reported protocols (see the Supporting Information).49,50 Preparation of ligands and the structure optimization parameters
of the best found metal-based ligand are reported elsewhere.23

Chemicals
The required chemicals
were procured from
Sigma-Aldrich/Merck/Fisher Scientific and used directly without any
purification. Reactions needing anhydrous conditions were carried
under continuous supply of nitrogen gas and using oven-dried glasswares.
Reaction progress was monitored using silica gel thin-layer chromatography
(SG-TLC; F254, Merck-Germany) and visualized in either
iodine-impregnated silica or a UV–Vis chamber. Instant thin-layer
chromatography (ITLC; Paul German, USA) was used for determining the
extent of radioconjugation and percent radiochemical purity of the 99mTc-labeled radiocomplex. 99mTc was purchased
from Regional Centre for Radiopharmaceuticals (northern region), BRIT,
DAE, India.

Animal Models
The required animal
experiments were
duly approved and conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the
Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) of INMAS (registration
no. 8/GO/a/99/CPCSEA). New Zealand rabbits weighing 2.5–3.0
kg were used for blood kinetics and SPECT scans. The biodistribution
and regional uptake studies were performed on the normal female BALB/c
mice weighing 25–30 g. The animals were received from a stock
colony, which was maintained at the INMAS animal facility, which were
fed ad libitum with continuous water supply. The habitat temperatures
were maintained at 22 ± 2 °C with the natural daytime light
followed by no light post 19 h until dawn.

Chemical Synthesis
6-Acetyl-3-(3-aminopropyl)benzo[d]thiazol-2(3H)-one (1)
The equimolar amounts of
6-acetyl-2-hydroxybenzothiazole (or 6-acetyl-benzo[d]thiazol-2-ol, 500 mg, 2.59 mmol) and K2CO3 (357.65 mg, 2.59 mmol) were mixed well in CH3COCH3 (30 mL), and the reaction mixture was heated to attain a
temperature of 60 °C. 3-Bromopropylamine hydrochloride solution
(566.53 mg, 2.59 mmol) prepared in CH3COCH3 was
then added dropwise to the above solution. The reaction mixture was
refluxed and stirred for the next 6 h. Reaction progress was accessed
by disappearance of the reactant in TLC, where chloroform/methanol
(9:1) solution was used as the solvent system. After reaction completion,
unreacted salts were filtered, and the filtrate was evaporated to
dryness. The resulting oily residue was mixed with diethyl ether (30
mL), and the amine product was precipitated as its hydrochloride salt
using dropwise addition of hydrochloric acid (concentrated, 1 N).
Diethyl ether was decanted off, and the precipitated light yellow
solid was dried under reduced pressure to get the final product (631.5
mg, 97.6%). δH (300 MHz; D2O): 1.97–2.06

Acid (2)
The solution of compound 1 (139.97 mg, 0.58 mmol) dissolved in dry DMF (5 mL) was added dropwise
into the stirring solution of DTPA dianhydride (100 mg, 0.28 mmol)
also dissolved in anhydrous DMF (10 mL). The reaction mixture was
then heated up to 60 °C, refluxed, and stirred for 24 h in an
inert atmosphere, wherein reaction pH was maintained at 8.0 with the
help of triethylamine (TEA). Reaction progress was monitored through
TLC by using a solution of water–0.01% TFA/MeOH (7:3). After
reaction completion, the solvent was evaporated to dryness, the obtained
residue was dissolved in the minimum volume of CH3OH, and
ice-chilled ether (30 mL) was added to precipitate. The expected compound
was obtained as a yellow solid. The product was purified using HPLC

UV–Vis and Potentiometric
Studies
Product formation
was assured by the appearance of amide and carbonyl excitation wavelengths
of the ligand upon bifunctional conjugation with DTPA. The λmax of the ligand was determined on the Biotek Synergy H4 hybrid
multiplate reader instrument, and potentiometric titrations were performed
as reported previously.23

Hemolysis and
MTT Assays
These assays were performed
as reported previously,23 and the average
values of three experiments were reported as final values.

Radiolabeling
of (6-AcBTZ)2DTPA
The radioisotope 99mTc was eluted as reported previously.23 Briefly, freshly prepared solution of 99mTcO4– (74–110 MBq, 2–3 mCi) was
added into the mixture of lyophilized (6-AcBTZ)2DTPA ligand
(1 mg) and stannous chloride (100 μg, prepared in N2-purged 0.1 N HCl solution) in deionized water (0.5 mL). The reaction
pH was maintained in the range of 6.5–7.0. The final radiocomplex
was purified using the C-18 Sep-Pak cartridge. Percent labeling efficiency
of 99mTc-(6-AcBTZ)2DTPA was analyzed using SG-ITLC
(Paul Gelman, USA) in (i) 100% CH3COCH3 and
(ii) C5H5N/CH3COOH/H2O
(3:5:1.5, v/v/v) as per the standard reported radiolabeling and purification
procedures.22,23

Partition Coefficient (Log Po/w)
Partition coefficient of 99mTc-(6-AcBTZ)2DTPA was determined using the protocol
reported previously.23 Briefly, 100 μL
of the radiocomplex (100
μM) was added to 100 μL of octanol in a centrifuge, vortexed
at room temperature, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. Radioactivity
counts of 50 μL of individual layers were measured, and the
log Po/w of the 99mTc-labeled
radioligand was calculated by dividing radioactivity counts of octanol
to the aqueous fraction. The partition coefficient of the unlabeled
compound was determined using UV–Vis spectrophotometry. Similar
protocol was followed, except the radioactivity part. Optical density
(OD) values of equal volumes (50 μL) of organic and inorganic
phases were measured on a Biotek Synergy H4 hybrid multiplate reader.
Values of log Po/w were determined by
taking the ratio of OD values obtained for octanol and water fractions.
The average of the three experiments was reported.

Stability in
Human Serum
Similar procedure was followed
as reported previously.23 Briefly, 99mTc-(6-AcBTZ)2DTPA (100 μL, 3.35 MBq) was
incubated with serum (900 μL) under similar environmental conditions
for 24 h. Precipitation of serum proteins was achieved by collecting
aliquots (100 μL) of the mixture at the incubation intervals
of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 24 h, respectively, followed by washing with
ethanol (200 μL) and centrifugation at 4 °C and 300g for 20 min. The radioactivity values of respective supernatant
solutions were recorded on a well-type γ-counter. Washed precipitates
(ethanol, 2 × 1 mL) were measured for counts compared with those
of supernatants, and the percent association with serum proteins was
determined. Intact radioconjugation was determined by counting the
radioactivity of supernatant solutions using ITLC-SG strips (100%
CH3COCH3) at the incubation intervals of 0.5–24
h. Serum stability was reported (average of three experiments) as
the plot of intact percent radiolabeling efficiency versus incubation
time with human serum.

Cysteine Challenge Study
The radioligand 99mTc-(6-AcBTZ)2DTPA (100 μL, 3.25 MBq) was
incubated
with cysteine (25, 50, and 100 mM) at 37 °C for up to 2 h. Fifty
microliters of aliquots from individual radiomixture was pipetted
out and spotted on ITLC-SG strips (0.1 M PBS solution, pH 7.4). The
dried ITLC-SG strips were cut and measured for radioactivity counts
in the corresponding portions to calculate the fraction of radioligand
chelated to the three concentrations of cysteine.

Pharmacokinetics
The blood kinetics of the radioligand
was evaluated in normal New Zealand rabbits weighing approximately
2.2–2.6 kg as reported previously.23 Briefly, blood samples (200 μL) of the i.v. administered radioligand
(200 μL, 37 MBq) were withdrawn beginning from 5 min–24
h, and the radioactivity counts of the aliquots were counted on the
well-type γ-counter. The decay-corrected dose at different time
intervals were then evaluated by assuming the whole-body blood volume
as 7% of the total body weight of rabbits. The final data was reported
as the percentage radioactivity remaining in blood at different time
intervals.

SPECT Scans
The SPECT images were
acquired on Siemens
γ-camera (Symbia True Point Dual Head). A healthy rabbit of
2.5 kg was anesthetized using diazepam, followed by i.v. administration
of 99mTc-(6-AcBTZ)2DTPA (100 μL, 3.7 MBq)
through the ear vein. The whole-body dynamic scans were acquired for
30 min after the on-bed administration of 99mTc-(6-AcBTZ)2DTPA. Circulation of the radiotracer was observed by analyzing
the scintigraphy after 30 min p.i., and the time points for tissue
distribution studies were estimated.

Biodistribution Studies
Tissue distribution of the
radiotracer was evaluated on normal female BALB/c mice (20–25
g, n = 15, 3). One hundred microliters of radiotracer
(3.68 MBq) was i.v.-administered through tail, and mice were sacrificed
at 2, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min p.i. The organs were harvested, washed,
and bottled to expel the excess liquid. The radioactivity in individual
organ was counted on the well-type γ-counter. Radioactivity
uptake in the individual organ was calculated and reported as the
% ID/g of the organ. Experiments were performed in triplicates.

Regional Uptake Evaluation
The analogous protocol was
performed as described above. Briefly, 5.2 MBq of radiotracer was
i.v.-injected via tail vein into the BALB/c mice (female, n = 15, group = 3, 20–25 g). The mice were euthanized
using overdose of isoflurane inhalation and sacrificed at the time
intervals of 2, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min p.i. The brains were then taken
out, kept in ice, washed with chilled saline, and weighed on the analytical
balance. The radioactivity uptake was then counted on the γ-ray
counter. Brain regions (hippocampus, striatum, cortex, cerebellum,
and the rest of the brain) were dissected, weighed, and measured for
activity, and the regional activity accumulation of 99mTc-(6-AcBTZ)2DTPA was then determined by taking the decay
correction factor into account.

Radioligand Binding Assay
The receptor binding of 99mTc-(6-AcBTZ)2DTPA
was determined using the radioligand
binding assays, as reported previously.23

5-HT1A Receptor
Briefly, the binding assay
was performed in the final volumes of 1000 μL, which contained
Tris buffer, hippocampus-membrane homogenate (61.48 μg/mL protein),
and varying radioligand concentrations. The nonspecific binding was
evaluated in the presence of 10 mM serotonin. Specific binding was
determined as the difference between the nonspecific binding and total
radioligand binding. The experiment was performed in triplicates (20
°C, 120 min), and incubation was halted by immediate filtration
through GF/B filters. These filters were quickly washed with ice-cold
buffer (2 mL), and the activity counts were measured on a well-type
γ-counter.

5-HT7 Receptor
Triplicate
experiments were
performed in the final volumes of 1.0 mL, which contained the Tris
buffer, cortex-membrane homogenate (2.63 mg/mL protein), and varying
radioligand concentrations. These samples were then vortexed and incubated
(20 °C, 60 min). The nonspecific binding was determined by an
excess amount of serotonin (100-fold). Filtration and radioactivity
measurements of individual samples were performed similarly, as described
above.
