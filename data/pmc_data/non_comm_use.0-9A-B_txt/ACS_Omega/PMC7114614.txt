Despite
its growing popularity and use, bottom-up proteomics remains
a complex analytical methodology. Its general workflow consists of
three main steps: sample preparation, liquid chromatography coupled
to tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS), and computational data
analysis. Quality assessment of the different steps and components
of this workflow is instrumental to identify technical flaws and avoid
loss of precious measurement time and sample material. However, assessment
of the extent of sample losses along with the sample preparation protocol,
in particular, after proteolytic digestion, is not yet routinely implemented
because of the lack of an accurate and straightforward method to quantify
peptides. Here, we report on the use of a microfluidic UV/visible
spectrophotometer to quantify MS-ready peptides directly in the MS-loading
solvent, consuming only 2 μL of sample. We compared the performance
of the microfluidic spectrophotometer with a standard device and determined
the optimal sample amount for LC–MS/MS analysis on a Q Exactive
HF mass spectrometer using a dilution series of a commercial K562
cell digest. A careful evaluation of selected LC and MS parameters
allowed us to define 3 μg as an optimal peptide amount to be
injected into this particular LC–MS/MS system. Finally, using
tryptic digests from human HEK293T cells and showing that injecting
equal peptide amounts, rather than approximate ones, result in less
variable LC–MS/MS and protein quantification data. The obtained
quality improvement together with easy implementation of the approach
makes it possible to routinely quantify MS-ready peptides as a next
step in daily proteomics quality control.

Introduction
Mass spectrometry (MS)-based
proteomics is a key technology in
modern life sciences, with a wide scope of applications for protein
research. Due to technological advances in liquid chromatography (LC)
and MS instrumentation, current LC–MS/MS systems perform at
high sensitivity, resolution, and speed.1−4 These improvements, coupled to robust bioinformatic
pipelines, now allow routine in-depth proteome measurements at high
confidence, explaining the success of the major proteomics applications
today: quantitative measurements of proteomes by so-called shotgun
proteomics, identification of protein interaction partners by affinity
purification MS (AP-MS), and mapping of some of the most common post-translational
modification (PTM) sites.

LC–MS/MS systems are inherently
prone to fluctuations in
performance. Whether an ion source that gets transiently unstable
in the course of an analytical run, a mass analyzer with a drift in
accuracy, or a chromatographic column whose stationary phase progressively
deteriorates, the different components of an LC–MS/MS system
vary during the operation time.5 Therefore,
continuous monitoring is required to diagnose technical flaws and
schedule maintenance interventions. For a very long time, however,
guidelines and standardized methods to assess the quality of MS-based
proteomics data were lacking. Over the last decade, great progress
has been made in proteomics quality control. On the one hand, various
reference sample formulations have been designed and are now commercialized
as standards to carry out quality control (QC) analysis.5,6 On the other hand, a number of metrics to assess LC–MS/MS
performance have been developed,7,8 in particular, for standard
workflows of bottom-up data-dependent analysis. Examples of QC metrics
that inform about the liquid chromatography step are full-width at
half-maximum (FWHM) of the eluting peptide peak and retention time
drifts of eluting peptides, which monitor the integrity of the chromatographic
column and the applied gradient. In turn, mass spectrometer QC can
be done through examination of mass accuracy, dynamic range, and ion
injection time. Importantly, various software tools for MS-based proteomics
QC have been created,9 which allow extraction
and visualization of QC metrics from analytical runs performed on
standard samples. One such example is a cloud-based quality control
system QCloud that allows following instrument performance over time
on a user-friendly web interface.10

Of utmost importance for the success of a proteomic experiment
is the QC assessment at the sample preparation level, where the major
sources of variation arise from (1) artificial and thus unwanted in
vitro protein/peptide modifications, (2) incomplete protein digestion,
(3) protein contamination introduced by users or present in reagents,
and (4) sample losses during sample transfer, enrichment steps, elution,
and reconstitution. While the extent at which the first three types
of variation compromise the quality of an analytical run can be quantified
(provided that the correct identification search settings are used),
no standardized QC procedures exist that account for analyte losses
after proteolytic digestion. Indeed, while the extracted amount of
protein material from cell or tissue samples is typically determined
by standard assays immediately upon lysis and/or protein extraction,
or prior to digestion (Figure 1), no such established quantification procedures exist at
the peptide level. An exception would be the bicinchoninic acid (BCA)
method using a peptide digest sample standard, but its dependence
on calibration and the consumption of large sample volumes make it
lengthy and costly. Of particular note, even when additional modifications,
enrichment steps, or cleaning procedures take place after digestion,
which will inevitably introduce additional sample losses and variability,
peptide quantification before the actual LC–MS/MS analysis
is generally not performed.

Figure 1 Schematic outline of the sample preparation
and quantification
steps in a generic bottom-up proteomics experiment. Peptide concentration
is usually estimated based on protein quantification before proteolytic
digestion (dark gray), but standard methods for performing this quantification
at the peptide level, right before LC–MS/MS (red), would be
highly desirable. Optional steps of the protocol are written in gray.

LC–MS/MS runs carried out with insufficient
amounts of peptides
result in ion signals below the detection limit of the mass spectrometer,
leading to low(er) numbers of peptide and protein identifications.
In this respect, low signal-to-noise ratios of peptide signals also
reduce the reliability of peptide quantification, as peak integration
is more difficult for such low signals. Although analysis can be repeated
by injecting more adequate sample amounts, this increases the overall
analysis time and associated costs and is not always possible for
low-quantity or low-volume samples. Equally troublesome is the injection
of excessive amounts of peptide material, termed column overloading.
Such column saturation leads to peak tailing and retention time shifts,11−15 leading to poorer peptide separation and higher ionization competition,
also reducing the number of identified and quantified peptides.16 In some cases, this saturation can even lead
to the obstruction of the column, which causes backpressure build-up,
in turn increasing the variability between repeated analyses of similar
samples.

Efforts to standardize procedures and minimize sample
losses during
sample preparation led to the development of simplified uniform protocols,
including protocols in which all predigestion steps, such as lysis,
protein reduction, and alkylation, are performed in a single volume.17−19 Solid-phase extraction (SPE) to purify and concentrate peptides
has also become a common practice at the end of the sample preparation
protocol. Furthermore, automated sample preparation workflows20,21 or robotized systems start to become available, which allow accurate
liquid handling, temperature control, and precise timing of processing
steps.22,23 Some of these methods can be performed in
miniaturized settings, which are advantageous when working with clinical
or other low-abundance samples where analyte amounts are scarce.22,24

Even when optimized sample preparation protocols are in place,
straightforward QC assessment at the peptide level would be highly
desirable for monitoring sample losses, leading to injecting optimal
peptide amounts for LC–MS/MS analysis. For such a procedure
to be aligned with a miniaturized, high-throughput mass spectrometry
workflow, it should allow (1) batchwise processing, (2) low sample
consumption, and (3) execution just before LC–MS/MS analysis
in the loading solvent used. Here, we present a procedure that complies
with these requirements, based on peptide quantification directly
in MS-loading buffer, in a microvolume, microfluidic, UV–visible
spectrophotomer that can process several samples simultaneously. Using
this procedure, we determined the optimal amount of peptides to be
injected for shotgun measurements on our LC–MS/MS setup. Finally,
we demonstrated that the application of this procedure for the control
of sample loading improves LC–MS/MS and protein quantitation
reproducibility.

Results and Discussion
The introduction
of a peptide purification step prior to LC–MS/MS
analysis24 in routine in proteomics laboratories
opened an opportunity to accurately determine peptide concentrations.
Such a peptide purification step, typically based on solid-phase extraction
(SPE), removes buffer components (like chaotropes, certain detergents,
reducing/alkylating reagents, and trypsin) that interfere with LC–MS/MS
analysis. As these components often absorb UV light, for a long time,
they prevented routine, fast, and accurate peptide quantification,
often leading to the analysis of suboptimal peptide amounts by LC–MS/MS.
The high purity of peptides obtained after SPE led us to explore the
possibility to quantify MS-ready peptide samples using a new-generation
UV–visible spectrophotometer.

Simple Application for
Accurate Quantification of MS-Ready Peptide
Samples
The Lunatic instrument, from Unchained Labs, is a
microfluidic spectrophotometer that performs DNA, RNA, protein, and
peptide quantifications in batch, consuming only 2 μL of sample.
Determination of peptide concentrations happens accurately by a proprietary
software application that, from an acquired UV–visible absorbance
spectrum, discriminates the signal coming from the UV-light-absorbing
amino acids from those of usual contaminants (e.g., nucleic acids,
cofactors). The “MS-peptide Quant” application quantifies
peptides by taking into account the 280 nm molar extinction coefficient
and the molecular weight of the average peptide species in a sample.

The ability to quantify complex peptide mixtures was verified using
dilution series of commercial protein digests from yeast, ranging
in concentration between 10 ng/μL and 1 μg/μL, based
on the theoretical peptide quantity as reported by the vendor. Comparison
between the theoretical concentration values and the measured ones
in four independent replicate dilutions showed a high linear correlation
(R2 > 0.98) and a slope very close
to
1 (t-test p-value = 0.19), demonstrating
the instrument’s high accuracy (Figure 2). Meanwhile, it was noticed that peptide
solutions with concentrations below 50 ng/μL gave absorbance
measurements lower than 0.03, the lower absorbance limit at which
the analyte concentration can be accurately assessed according to
the instrument specifications. Therefore, it was concluded that solutions
of peptides with concentrations between 50 ng/μL and 1 μg/μL
are within the dynamic range of the instrument and can thus be accurately
measured. This concentration range is well suited for MS-ready samples,
for which LC–MS/MS experiments typically consume peptide quantities
between 100 ng and 5 μg, contained in a volume of a few microliters.

Figure 2 Dynamic
quantification range of the microfluidic spectrophotometer
for complex peptide mixtures. Yeast peptide digest solutions with
concentrations ranging from 10 ng/μL to 1.0 μg/μL
(black dots) can be accurately measured, as shown by a strong correlation
between the theoretical and measured peptide concentration values.
Below 50 ng/μL (red dots), peptide measurements are no longer
reliable, as absorbance values reach the lower limit of detection
of the spectrophotometer. Dots represent measurements of four independent
replicate dilutions.

We next compared peptide
mixture quantification on our microfluidic
device with quantification on a NanoDrop, a reference instrument among
the class of microvolume spectrophotometers, which has also been used
for measurements of MS-ready peptide samples.25−27 In particular,
we performed A280 measurements of five samples of HEK293 tryptic digests
and compared across-instrument mean and coefficients of variation
(CV) values. This analysis showed that quantification estimates differ
slightly between instruments, with those from Lunatic always laying
below those of NanoDrop (8–19% lower means across the five
samples, Mann–Whitney U test p-value < 0.05) (Figure S2). Furthermore,
in terms of precision, this was visibly higher in Lunatic relative
to NanoDrop (55–81% lower CV across the five samples).

In summary, together with its accuracy for the measurement of peptide
solutions at commonly used concentration ranges, peptide quantitation
with the Lunatic instrument presents a unique set of characteristics
that make it particularly attractive over other quantification methods
for MS-ready bottom-up proteomics samples (e.g., Bradford, Lowry,
BCA, Pierce 660 nm, tryptophan fluorescence,28 and other A280 methods). It is a quick and easy method that can
be performed in batch. It only implies a very low, 2 μL, sample
consumption. It is based on UV light absorbance at 280 nm, an intrinsic
property of aromatic amino acids, thus requiring no calibration curve,
unlike colorimetric reaction-based assays like Bradford or BCA. Finally,
with this instrument, it is possible to reach a higher level of precision
than with other reference spectrophotometers also performing A280-based
peptide quantification.

Determination of an Optimal Peptide Amount
for LC–MS/MS
Analysis
The ideal peptide amount to use for LC–MS/MS
to have a maximum throughput and identification rate, while keeping
a good analyte separation, will largely depend on the characteristics
of the LC–MS/MS system, namely, on its chromatographic column
loading capacity. If the exact sample concentration would be known,
it would be possible to always work with optimal sample amounts and
thus consistently get high-quality LC–MS/MS runs.

Therefore,
taking advantage of peptide quantification by the microfluidic spectrophotometer,
we set out to determine the most suitable sample loading for an LC–MS/MS
setup routinely used in our laboratory: a 40 cm LC column packed in
the needle with 1.9 μm C18 beads coupled to a Q Exactive HF
mass spectrometer.

Starting from a commercial tryptic digest
of a K562 cell lysate,
we prepared 10 different samples, from which 5 μL, containing
peptide amounts ranging from 0.06 to 12 μg, was injected for
LC–MS/MS analysis using a 2.5 h gradient. The experiment was
repeated to generate data for two independent series of replicates
analyzed on two different LC columns (Figures 3 and S3).

Figure 3 Quality control
metrics from LC–MS/MS analysis of 10 different
amounts of a trypsin-digested K562 cell extract. (a) Theoretical and
measured peptide amounts for two independent experiments. In both
experiments, all measured values were lower than predicted, pointing
to peptide losses during sample solution preparation. (b) Bar plots
indicating the numbers of identified peptide and proteins per analytical
run. Colors represent the results of two replicate series analyzed
on two different LC columns. (c) Representative heatmap visualizing
the intensities of quantified proteins in each of the 10 analytical
runs measured using LC column 1. Missing values are shown in gray.
Based on numbers of identified and quantified proteins a rather broad
window ranging from 1.49 to 5.20 μg of peptides was found as
an optimal injection amount. (d) Scatter plots of average MS2 ion
injection time, median peak area, and median signal-to-noise ratio
(S/N) of identified peptides in each analytical run. (e) Scatter plots
of the median peak area of hydrophilic, intermediate hydrophobic,
and hydrophobic identified peptides. For both replicate series, from
around 2–3 μg, peak areas decline steeply for hydrophilic
peptides, while they go up progressively for hydrophobic peptides,
two types of peptide classes having a lower and higher affinity for
the used precolumn, respectively. Colors represent the results of
two replicate series analyzed on two different LC columns. Loss curve
fitting was used to generate the connecting lines. Based on the loss
of hydrophilic peptides, 3 μg was defined as an optimal peptide
injection amount for this particular LC–MS/MS setup (dashed
lines).

All peptide concentration measurements
were lower than predicted
(Figure 3a). Likely,
these deviations arose mostly from peptide losses during peptide resuspension
of the K562 digest, as additional losses during the preparation of
serially diluted samples were minor (R2 > 0.99 for the comparison of theoretical vs measured sample concentrations).
We also noticed that peptide quantification of #Dilution 1 and 2,
having theoretical concentrations of 0.013 and 0.025 μg/μL,
respectively, returned negative values. These clearly inaccurate measurements
were performed below the limit of detection of the spectrophotometer.

To find an optimal peptide amount to inject into our LC–MS/MS
setup, we evaluated the rates of identified and quantified proteins.
To this end, the LC–MS/MS data were searched with MaxQuant29 and identified proteins were quantified by the
MaxLFQ algorithm30 (Figures 3b,c and S3 and Table S1). The number of identified peptides
reached a maximum between 1.49 and 3.28 μg and showed a marked
decrease for higher peptide amounts (18–20% reduction in the
number of identified peptides for the 10.99 μg samples), likely
due to column overloading. In turn, identified and quantified protein
numbers increased with the injected peptide amount until 3.28–5.20
μg, above which they started to level off and the same trend
was seen for individual proteins (Figure S3). Based on these numbers, a rather broad window ranging from approximately
1.49–5.20 μg of peptides was found as an optimal peptide
injection amount for our LC–MS/MS setup.

In an attempt
to further narrow down this window, we evaluated
selected LC and MS parameters. The efficient time consumption of a
mass spectrometer is, among other things, reflected by the ion injection
time. The closer to ideal the amount of material presented to the
mass spectrometer is, the lower the injection time will be. Figure 3d (left panel) shows
that MS2 ion injection time reached an optimal minimum around an average
amount of 3.28 μg of injected peptides. We also assessed the
two LC parameters signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of chromatographic peaks
and peak areas. Figure 3d (right panel) shows that the average S/N ratio increased with increasing
peptide amounts and again leveled off at an average sample amount
of about 3.28 μg. Analysis of the median peak area of all identified
peptides showed a maximum between 5.20 and 7.08 μg for the two
replicate experiments (Figure 3d, middle). When overloading a reversed-phase C18 column,
one expects peak tailing, with a concomitant increase of the average
peak area due to repulsion effects of same-charge ions.13−15 The observed leveling off and even decrease in the peak area at
higher loads though contradicted this expectation. To explore this
further, we split peptides according to their retention time interval
in three parts: early eluting peptides (hydrophilic, n = 126), late eluting peptides (hydrophobic, n =
178), and the ones eluting in between (mid eluting/intermediate hydrophobic
peptides, n = 2304) (Figure S1). Such partitioning procedure revealed that the registered decrease
in peak areas was due to a steep decline of hydrophilic peptides peak
areas (Figure 3e) starting
from 2–3 μg of sample due to the use of a trapping column
in our LC–MS/MS setup, whose capacity did not allow retention
of the most hydrophilic peptides for higher sample amounts, leading
to this trend for hydrophilic peptides loss.

The disadvantage
of losing hydrophilic peptides does not overrule
the advantages of using a trapping column though if void volumes are
avoided.31 Therefore, based on the loss
of hydrophilic peptides for amounts above 2.86 and 2.63 μg for
replicate series 1 and 2, respectively (peptide amounts that correspond
to the peak maxima in the hydrophilic peptides peak area plot), together
with the stabilization of the other parameters also around these sample
amounts, we now routinely use 3 μg of peptides as an optimal
injection amount on this particular LC–MS/MS setup.

By
running a series of LC–MS/MS analysis, covering a range
of known peptide sample amounts, and performing a follow-up evaluation
of the numbers of identified and quantified features, as well as of
a few LC and MS parameters, we were able to identify 3 μg as
an optimal amount of injected peptides for our LC–MS/MS setup.
This procedure could be applied to any other system and as such be
of great use in proteomics laboratories. Indeed, knowledge about the
most adequate sample amounts to use is currently not known for most
systems. As a workaround to deal with this lack of information, it
is common to either inject different concentrations of the same sample
or else to perform short off-line analytical runs to fine-tune sample
loading for a given sample.32 However,
these strategies are time- and cost-ineffective and often consume
higher amounts of precious sample material than the simple UV-based
procedure described here.

Control over Peptide Amount Injections Effectively
Stabilizes
LC–MS/MS and Protein Quantitation Reproducibility
During sample preparation, it is common to make the protein amounts
for all samples of a batch even before proceeding to the digestion
step. This will generate very equivalent MS samples that can then
be injected for LC–MS/MS using equal volumes. We decided to
evaluate whether, in comparison to that approach, performing peptide
quantification prior to MS and concomitantly adjusting injection volumes
to account for small differences in samples concentrations would have
an impact on the reproducibility of LC–MS/MS and, in particular,
of quantitation data.

To this end, we analyzed five tryptic
digests of HEK293 cells, prepared in parallel starting from five different
cell pellets. On the first set of analytical runs, we corrected for
the peptide amounts loaded based on measured sample concentration,
having injected exactly 3.0 μg of peptide mixture for all five
replicates. In contrast, on the second set of runs of the same samples,
we injected a fixed volume, corresponding to the average used for
the first experiment. After calculating the peptide loadings for this
second experiment, we realized there was a difference of 1 μg
between the lowest and highest concentrations of the sample (2.5 and
3.55 μg, respectively). These differences are quite substantial
and show the importance of accurate peptide quantitation of MS-ready
samples. Even with the automation of sample preparation, which should
alleviate heterogeneity between samples, peptide quantitation could
always be kept as a quality check step.

For both sets, the previously
used MS and LC parameters were examined
(Figure 4a). Strikingly,
while all MS injection time, peak area, and S/N noise ratio values
were close to each other in the experiment with the “corrected”
sample amounts, these showed a much higher spread in the second experiment
where each analytical run had a different sample amount. Indeed, the
standard deviation for the MS2 injection time, peak area, and S/N
ratio had a tenfold, threefold, and twofold increase, respectively,
for the “noncorrected” experiment relative to the corrected
experiment (Figure 4a).

Figure 4 Comparison of LC–MS/MS and protein quantification reproducibility
for two sets of analytical runs on trypsin-digested Hek293T cell extracts.
(a) Plots of the average MS2 injection time, median peak area, and
median signal-to-noise ratio values are shown for the identified peptides
in each of five replicates from the corrected and “noncorrected”
groups of samples. For each data point, the exact injected peptide
amount based on quantification on the microfluidic spectrophotometer
is shown on the right. Vertical bars represent the mean ± standard
deviation. (b) Density plots and boxplots showing the distribution
of the coefficients of variation (CV) of raw intensities (left) and
(normalized) maxLFQ intensities (right) for all proteins quantified
in the ten analytical runs (n = 2677). For both raw
and normalized protein intensities, a shift to higher CV values was
found for the noncorrected samples (Mann–Whitney U test p-value < 2.2 × 10–16 for the shift in both raw and normalized distributions).

Finally, we checked whether this higher analytical reproducibility
also resulted in a more precise protein quantification. To this end,
we looked at the distribution of the coefficients of variation (CV)
of raw protein intensity values from corrected replicates versus those
from noncorrected replicates. In addition, we compared the CV distributions
for label-free quantitation (LFQ) protein intensity values obtained
after normalization by the MaxLFQ algorithm. As expected, CV values
for the non-normalized intensities were significantly lower for the
corrected experiment (Figure 4b, Mann–Whitney U test p-value < 2.2 × 10–16). However, a shift
toward lower CV values was also observed for the normalized LFQ intensities
of the corrected experiment (Mann–Whitney U test p-value < 2.2 × 10–16), indicating that computational normalization cannot fully compensate
for differences in injection amounts. Such a reduction in the dispersion
of protein quantification estimates can potentially improve the sensitivity
for detecting peptide and protein regulation. Together, these data
show that working consistently with equal peptide amounts results
in increased reproducibility LC–MS/MS and protein quantification
data, even in combination with the normalization of protein intensities
during data analysis.

Conclusions
In the present work,
we describe a simple procedure to quantify
MS-ready peptides using a microfluidic UV–visible spectrophotometer.
This instrument, with its integrated peptide quantification software
application, constitutes an accurate and easy-to-use device for the
implementation of peptide quantification in proteomics laboratories
and facilities. Through careful control of the injected peptide amount
on a commonly used LC–MS/MS setup, we show how this procedure
can provide a constant quality boost to MS-based proteome analyses.
The application of this methodology on a routine basis can drastically
reduce time and sample losses by avoiding reruns after the injection
of suboptimal peptide amounts.

Methods
Sample Preparation
HEK293 cells (5 × 5 ×
106) were harvested, washed 3 times in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), and resuspended in lysis buffer (8 M urea; 20 mM HEPES,
pH 8.0). Samples were sonicated by three pulses of 15 s, interspaced
by 1 min pauses on ice, at an intensity output of 15 W, and centrifuged
for 15 min at 20 000g at room temperature
to remove insoluble components. The protein concentration in the supernatants
of each sample was measured using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and
equal protein amounts (500 μg each) were used for further analysis.
Proteins were reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (Sigma-Aldrich)
for 30 min at 55 °C. Alkylation was performed by the addition
of 10 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min at room temperature
in the dark. The samples were diluted with 20 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES), pH 8.0, to a urea concentration of 4 M, and proteins
were pre-digested with 5 μg of endoLysC (Wako, 129–02541)
(1/100, w/w) for 4 h at 37 °C. All samples were further diluted
with 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, to a final urea concentration of 2 M, and
proteins were digested with 5 μg of trypsin (V5111, Promega)
(1/100, w/w) overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were then purified
on a SampliQ SPE C18 cartridge (Agilent), vacuum-dried, and kept at
−20 °C until further use.

Peptide Concentration Measurements
Quantification of
peptide mixtures was based on the UV absorbance of aromatic amino
acids at 280 nm (A280), on the following spectrophotometer models:
a Lunatic microfluidic device (Unchained Labs) and NanoDrop ND-1000
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). In the case of Lunatic, peptide concentrations
were determined by the instrument’s MS-peptide Quant tool,
while the “A280” application was used with NanoDrop,
with the sample type option set to “1 Abs = 1 mg/mL”.

Linear Dynamic Range Determination
The linear dynamic
range for measurement of complex peptide mixtures on the microfluidic
spectrophotometer was determined on a group of eight solutions prepared
from a 1.0 μg/μL stock of a commercial yeast protein digest
(Promega, V7461), dissolved in loading solvent (0.1% trifluoroacetyl
(TFA) in acetonitrile/water, 2:98 (v/v)). Measurements of solutions
in the 1.0 μg/μL to 10 ng/μL concentration range
(used concentrations were 0.010, 0.025, 0.050, 0.100, 0.250, 0.500,
0.750, and 1.000 μg/μL) were done in quadruplicate, from
four yeast protein digest vials, and at least two readouts per solution
were taken.

Comparison of Peptide Quantification in Distinct
Microvolume
Spectrophotometers
Quantification of peptide mixtures in
the two microvolume spectrophotometers was carried out on five samples
of HEK293 tryptic digest (n = 10 repeated measurements
each sample). Sample means and coefficients of variation (CV) were
compared.

Assessment of Optimal Loading Amount
A commercially
available K562 cell digest (Promega, V6951) was used to create a twofold
dilution series ranging from 0.013 to 2.4 μg/μL. Peptide
amounts ranging from 0.06 μg up to 12 μg were loaded on
an LC–MS/MS system. In parallel, the actual sample concentration
values were assessed with the MS-peptide Quant method (see Figure 3a). The same experiment
was repeated using a new K562 cell vial to prepare the dilution series
and a different analytical column.

Assessment of LC–MS/MS
Analysis Quality under Controlled
Sample Loading Conditions
Five HEK293 protein digest samples
were resuspended in 30 μL of MS-loading solvent (0.1% TFA in
acetonitrile/water, 2:98 (v/v)) and measured with MS-peptide Quant.
Two sets of LC–MS/MS analytical runs followed. In the first
one, 3.0 μg of peptide mixture from each sample was loaded onto
the LC–MS/MS system, while in the second one, the same sample
volume was used for all five injections, resulting in peptide amounts
ranging from 2.50 to 3.55 μg (detailed in the Results section).

LC–MS/MS Analysis
From each
sample, 5 μL
was introduced into an LC–MS/MS system through an Ultimate
3000 RSLC nano LC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) in-line
connected to a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
The sample mixture was first loaded on a trapping column (made in-house,
100 μm internal diameter (I.D.) × 20 mm, 5 μm beads
C18 Reprosil-HD, Dr. Maisch, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany). After
flushing from the trapping column, the sample was loaded on an analytical
column (made in-house, 75 μm I.D. × 400 mm, 1.9 μm
beads C18 Reprosil-HD, Dr. Maisch) packed in the needle (pulled in-house).
Peptides were loaded with the loading solvent (0.1% TFA in acetonitrile/water,
2:98 (v/v)) and eluted with a nonlinear 150 min gradient of 2–56%
solvent B (0.1% formic acid in water/acetonitrile, 20:80 (v/v)) at
a flow rate of 250 nL/min. This was followed by a 15 min wash reaching
99% solvent B and re-equilibration with solvent A (0.1% formic acid).
The column temperature was kept constant at 50 °C (CoControl
3.3.05, Sonation).

The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent,
positive ionization mode, automatically switching between MS and MS/MS
acquisition for the 16 most abundant peaks in a given MS spectrum.
The source voltage was set to 3.0 kV, and the capillary temperature
was 250 °C. Full-scan MS spectra (375–1500 m/z, AGC target 3 × 106 ions, maximum
ion injection time of 45 ms) were acquired at a resolution of 60 000
(at 200 m/z) in the orbitrap analyzer,
followed by up to 16 tandem MS scans (resolution 15 000 at
200 m/z) of the most intense ions
fulfilling predefined selection criteria (AGC target, 1 ×105 ions; maximum ion injection time, 60 ms; isolation window,
1.5 m/z; fixed first mass, 145 m/z; spectrum data type, centroid; underfill
ratio, 2%; intensity threshold, 1.3 × 104; exclusion
of unassigned, singly, and >7 charged precursors; peptide match
preferred;
exclude isotopes on; and dynamic exclusion time, 12 s). The higher
collisional dissociation (HCD) collision energy was set to 28% of
the normalized collision energy and the polydimethylcyclosiloxane
background ion at 445.12002 Da was used for internal calibration (lock
mass).

Data Analysis
Data analysis was performed with MaxQuant
software (version 1.6.1.0).29 The Andromeda
search engine was used with default settings, including PSM, peptide,
and protein false discovery rate set at 1% and match between runs
disabled. Spectra were searched against the UniProt reference proteome
release 2018_01 (UP000005640_9606, containing 21007 human protein
entries) with a mass tolerance for precursor and fragment ions of
4.5 and 20 ppm, respectively. The oxidation of methionine residues
and acetylation of protein N-termini were defined
as variable modifications, while carbamidomethylation of cysteine
residues was set as a fixed modification. Proteins with at least one
unique or razor peptide were retained and then quantified by the MaxLFQ
algorithm integrated into the MaxQuant software.30 A minimum ratio count of two unique or razor peptides was
required for quantification. Further data analysis was performed with
the Perseus software (version 1.6.1.3) after loading the protein groups
file from MaxQuant. The number of protein identifications was given
by the number of protein groups obtained after filtering out protein
groups only identified by site, reverse database hits, and potential
contaminants. The number of peptide identifications was obtained after
the exclusion of reverse database hits and potential contaminants.
Quantified proteins were the subset of identified proteins with positive
LFQ intensities. Heat maps were prepared from matrices of log 2-transformed
LFQ protein expression values, after filtering for at least three
valid values over all samples. Proteins were displayed according to
the order of groups defined by hierarchical clustering using Euclidean
distances and average linkage settings.

The chromatographic
parameters signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio and peak area were obtained
using the moFF algorithm,33 executed on
each analytical run. Peak areas were approximated by the area of a
triangle of base equal to the peak width (in minutes) and height given
by the peak’s apex intensity. The MS2 injection time was retrieved
from MaxQuant’s MS/MS scans table. This analysis was done on
peptide-to-spectrum matches from features detected in every analytical
run from each experiment. Peptides were partitioned according to hydrophobicity
by the following way: hydrophilic peptides were those eluting until
50 min of the LC gradient (1.6–12.3% acetonitrile), intermediate
hydrophobic peptides were eluted between 50 and 110 min (12.3–26.6%
acetonitrile), and hydrophobic peptides were eluted after 110 min
(26.6–79.2% acetonitrile) (Figure S1).

The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited
to the
ProteomeXchange Consortium (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org) via the PRIDE partner repository with the identifier 10.6019/PD014524.
