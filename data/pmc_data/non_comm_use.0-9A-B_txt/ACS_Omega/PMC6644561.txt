Lignin is a byproduct
of agricultural industries and only has limited
applications. In this study, lignin was investigated for use in sustainable
biopolymeric packaging film. Alkali lignin (AL) and lignosulfonate
(LSS) were added to enzymatically modified soy protein isolate (SPI)
biopolymeric film with different concentrations with the goal of improvement
of film physical and functional properties. A radical scavenging activity
test revealed that films containing LSS had values 28 and 6% higher
than control and AL-based films, respectively; AL itself (not in films)
had significantly higher radical scavenging activity than LSS. This
indicates the activity of lignin is affected by interaction with SPI.
The higher compatibility between LSS and enzymatically modified SPI
resulted in a positive effect on surface smoothness, water absorption,
and mechanical properties of LSS-based films. Films containing AL
showed a high light absorption range in the UV region, and this UV-blocking
ability increased with increasing level of lignin. Deconvoluted Fourier
transform infrared spectra confirmed that the addition of lignin resulted
in some changes in the secondary structure of the protein matrix,
which were aligned with X-ray diffraction results. The addition of
lignin improved tensile strength (TS) and thermal stability of films
compared to the lignin-free control. This improvement in TS and thermal
stability was probably a result of new intermolecular interactions
between lignin and SPI. Water vapor permeability of the films containing
lignin decreased to 50% of the control because lignin played a role
as a filler in the matrix. On the basis of our observations, the incorporation
of lignin into biopolymeric film is capable of providing additional
benefits and solutions to various industries, such as food, packaging,
agriculture, and pharmaceuticals.

Introduction
Active packaging is one of many types
of smart packaging that offers
extra functionality for food preservation other than providing an
inert barrier.1 Because of the customer
demand and market trends, the area of active packaging is becoming
increasingly important. Incorporating antioxidants to food packaging,
especially for products sensitive to oxidation, is designed to provide
additional safety and security by inhibiting the initiation or propagation
of oxidizing chain reactions.2 Lipid oxidation
is associated with coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, cancer,
and the aging process.3 Antioxidants prevent
oxidation by three main mechanisms: UV-light blocking, radical scavenging,
and chelation.4−6 In general, there are two categories of antioxidants:
natural and synthetic. Common synthetic antioxidants, such as butylated
hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), have some
restrictions in application to food products due to their carcinogenicity.7

Lignin, as a natural antioxidant, contains
phenolic compounds that
prevent lipid oxidation with a similar mechanism to that of BHT or
BHA.8 According to Pan et al.,9 the characteristics of lignin due to phenolic
hydroxyl groups, aliphatic hydroxyl groups, low molecular weight,
and narrow polydispersity result in significant antioxidant activity.
Lignin has an aromatic and highly cross-linked structure and is quite
reactive due to its functional groups. Therefore, lignin is able to
interact with many polymers and change their wettability, fire resistance,
and mechanical properties.8 Oliviero et
al.8 revealed that the addition of lignin
to zein protein matrix caused some changes in the secondary structure
of the zein protein, α-helix, β-sheet, and β-turn.
Therefore, lignin can modify physicochemical properties (other than
antioxidant activity) in some films.

On the basis of the type,
source of lignin, and its extraction
procedure, lignin has different structures, purity, and corresponding
properties.10 Alkali lignin (AL) and lignosulfonate
(LSS) are derived from pulping processes in papermaking. Lignosulfonates
are water soluble and possess higher molecular weight than AL. Alkali
lignin is soluble at high pH. Both AL and LSS are commercially available.10

The effect of different types of lignin
on the functional and physicochemical
properties of natural polymers at different film preparation conditions
has been extensively studied.4,8,11−13 However, the interaction between soy protein isolate
(SPI) and lignin under transglutaminase enzyme treatment, which may
potentially cross-link them, has not been explored yet.

Transglutaminase
was applied in the SPI structure to catalyze cross-linking
between ε-amine group in lysine and δ-carboxyamide group
on protein-bound glutamine residues leading to the improvement of
covalent cross-linking of proteins. Soy protein isolate is a rich
source of lysine (6.4%) and glutamine (19%) residues.14

The ultimate objective of this study is to investigate
the effect
of the enzyme treatment on both physicochemical properties and cross-linking
possibility of biopolymeric films fabricated with SPI and lignin types
and concentrations, as well as processing conditions.

Results and Discussion
Rheological
Behaviors of Film-Forming Solutions
It
was expected that the enzyme may catalyze cross-linking between soy
protein isolate (SPI) and lignin due to many functional groups, such
as abundant free amino groups, in both materials and it may bring
in increased viscosity of the solution (Figure 1). However, as observed in Figure 2, the addition of lignin reduced
the viscosity of the film forming SPI solution comparing to the control.
This reduction in
the viscosity suggests that lignin played a role of a lubricant. When
the concentration of AL increased, the viscosity decreased by approximately
10-fold compared to the control. The viscosity of the protein solution
containing 4 g/100 g was higher than that of 2 g/100 g SPI–lignin
solution and similar to the control. This may result from the possible
formation of intermolecular secondary bonds between SPI and AL. As
shown in Figure 2 (left),
modifying the structure of the protein matrix with LSS showed the
very complicated rheological profile upon the shear rate. This is
clearly indicating that there is molecular level interaction between
SPI and water-soluble lignosulfonate (LSS), which has more reactive
functional groups. At a higher shear rate (more than 10) and a higher
concentration of both AL and LSS (more than 6 g/100 g), the interaction
might be easily disrupted, which was due to the hindrance effect of
high concentration of lignin material in the protein matrix that caused
lignin to act like a lubricant. In a previous study reported by Mu
et al.,15 a mixture of gelatin and lignin
was applied as an environmentally friendly (green) lubricant due to
the abundance of hydrogen bonding sites and their interchain interactions.
Our observations agree well with other experiments, such as Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) results, which
will be explained in the following sections. In conclusion, incorporation
of lignin into SPI solution followed by enzymatic reaction may form
physicochemical interactions between components instead of enzymatic
cross-linking.

Antioxidant Activity of Lignin
Antioxidant activity
of lignin was measured by the ability of material to absorb or scavenge
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radicals in a food system.
Free radicals accelerate lipid oxidation, which can decrease the shelf
life of food products. As shown in Table 1, the radical scavenging activity of alkali
lignin was approximately 55%. It was higher than lignosulfonate and
some other natural antioxidants extracted from different berries (tested
at 1 mg/mL).16 Herein, the DPPH scavenging
activity is expressed relative to the testing solution (methanol).
Radical scavenging activity of alkali lignin is equivalent to 56%
of BHT. It is well known that the radical scavenging activity is affected
by many factors, such as structural features, presence of functional
groups such as phenolic hydroxyl groups, and molecular weight.9,17 The higher radical scavenging activity of alkali lignin itself resulted
from the structural and chemical composition differences compared
to lignosulfonate (lower molecular weight10 and higher hydrogen donation ability in the AL, perhaps due to −SH
groups; Figure 1).

DPPH Free Radical Scavenging Test of Films
Radical
scavenging activity of SPI films with and without lignin and a control
containing BHT are shown in Table 2. SPI films modified with the enzyme did not show powerful
antioxidant activity (2.25%). However, after the addition of lignin
to SPI films, radical scavenging activity of films in the DPPH methanol
solution increased dramatically. Interestingly, films containing LSS
showed a slightly higher radical scavenging ability compared to films
containing AL, whereas AL material itself showed higher scavenging
activity than LSS material itself (Table 1). This discrepancy could be attributed to
high compatibility of LSS in the protein matrix. This compatibility
is due to the strong intra- and intermolecular interactions between
hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and polar groups of lignosulfonate and soy
protein side chains.11 Lignosulfonate electrolyte
contains a high amount of sulfonate groups (more than 5–8%,
based on the supplier datasheet), Ca2+, and many polar
groups in their aliphatic side chains, which resulted in high concentration
of ionic compounds in the protein matrix11 (Figure 1).

Color, Opacity, and UV-Blocking
of Films
The color
of the packaging film is important for general appearance and consumer
acceptance. The enzymatically modified soy protein isolate film was
transparent, unmarked, and had a homogenous texture. After the addition
of lignosulfonate (Figure 3, right column), films were still transparent and the visual
appearance was well-matched to the L-value measured
by the Hunter Lab color meter. Both the greenness and yellowness of
these films increased as a function of lignin concentration. This
increase showed the same trend with opacity (Figure 3 and Table 3). On the other hand, films incorporating AL (Figure 3, left column) were
dark and the darkness increased with the increase of concentration
(Figure 3). This trend
was also observed for opacity measurements. Consequently, the observations
in Figure 3 for both
films agreed well with opacity and color measurements. This may indicate
that lignin is homogeneously distributed in the SPI matrix.

Antioxidant activity
of lignin in a polymeric matrix is attributed
to not only radical scavenging activity but also its UV-blocking ability
due to the opacity in the film (Figure 4). Films containing AL are reddish, which is due to
the chromophoric nature of lignin, and this characteristic is known
to block UV radiation.18,19 As shown in Figure 4, modified films with AL showed
a broader range of absorption within the UV region (under 400 nm)
compared to films with LSS. The UV absorption region increased as
a function of concentration in the films modified with both lignins.
The UV scanning results of modified films were in agreement to the
results from other methods, such as visual observation (Figure 3), colorimeter, and opacity
(Table 3). Modified
films with AL 10 g/100 g showed a UV absorption region similar to
modified fish gelatin films prepared by Núñez-Flores
et al.4 with 15 g/100 g lignin, although
their lignin type was different than the one we used. The UV blocking
ability of lignin-modified films may be a beneficial property in food
packaging, especially when the product is sensitive to the UV-induced
oxidation process.

FTIR
To assess the effect of lignin
on the secondary
structure of enzymatically modified SPI film, FTIR analysis can be
used.20 As shown in Figure 5, FTIR spectra of control film and films
containing 10% w/w AL or LSS were not significantly different. According
to the rheological behavior observed, secondary structure changes
(α-helix and β-sheets) might occur in the enzymatically
modified SPI matrix. Therefore, the amide I and amide II regions (1800–1400
cm–1) in FTIR spectra were deconvoluted. Amide I
was created from C=O stretching vibration and the sensitive
changes in the secondary structure of protein, such as α-helix,
β-sheets, and β-turn, where their stretching vibrations
were at 1651, 1623, and 1676 cm–1, respectively.21,22 The deconvolutions of the analyzed spectral region of the control
film and the modified films with AL and LSS are shown in Figure 5. The addition of
AL showed shifts of α-helix and β-sheet peaks to a higher
wavenumber, whereas LSS-based film showed shifts to a lower wavenumber.
In general, shifting amide I to lower wavenumber values indicates
more order in the secondary structure of proteins.20 This suggests that AL caused more disordering of the secondary
structure of the protein matrix compared to LSS. This disordering
behavior of AL agrees with the rheological behavior, which is observed
in Figure 2, and the
XRD pattern, which is shown in Figure 6. This behavior also agrees with the finding of Oliviero
et al.8 They reported that low concentrations
of lignin (1 and 3 g/100 g) in zein protein shifted amide I spectra
to lower frequencies due to the formation of hydrogen bonding between
amino acids of zein and functional groups of lignin.

Amide II band was created from
C–N and N–H stretching
deformation vibration.22 AL-based film
showed shifts of amide II band to higher frequencies, whereas LSS
films showed shifts to lower frequencies compared to the control film.

XRD
The XRD patterns of enzymatically modified SPI
film with AL and LSS are shown in Figure 6. XRD spectra of films showed a typical pattern
for protein. Two peaks at 2θ = 9.5 and 20° positions were
related to two d-spacings around 4.6 Å (d0) and 8.96 Å (di). Olivero et al.23 suggested
that these two peaks are attributed to the average backbone distance
within α-helix structure of the protein and d-spacing of α-interhelix packing, respectively, and they observed
these two peaks in thermoplastic zein foam nanocomposite modified
with 10 g/100 g AL and LSS. Compared with the control film, the lower
intensity of modified films with lignin showed the hierarchical changes
in SPI matrix due to the addition of lignin. This reduction may be
attributed to the disruption of α-interhelix packing.23 The XRD spectra were well-matched to the FTIR
spectra, indicating that the addition of lignin interrupted the secondary
structure of the protein matrix according to the reduced intensity.
The consistency in the general pattern implies that there is a high
compatibility between lignin and enzymatically modified SPI matrix.
On the other hand, Huang et al.11 reported
that SPI sheets containing LSS exhibited a higher degree of crystallinity
compared to the films without lignin due to the physical cross-linking
of LSS that favored the ordered structure in the SPI matrix. This
discrepancy in their finding and ours might be due to the variation
in films processing conditions, while, they used hot-pressed and we
applied solvent casting method. In conclusion, XRD spectra showed
that films with and without lignin are in the amorphous state.

Environmental
Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM)
Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of both airside and plateside surfaces
of films modified with AL and LSS are shown in Figure 7. Our previous research has shown that the
enzymatic treatment of SPI film matrix increased surface roughness
of the film compared to the nonenzyme treated films, which was due
to the aggregation of hydrophobic groups of SPI made by transglutaminase.24 In contrast, enzymatically modified films with
lignin have different morphological structures on both airside and
plateside surfaces. These differences may have resulted from the thickness
(approximately 0.1 mm) of the films. The control film showed smooth
surfaces on both the airside and the plateside. However, the roughness
on the airside of films increased after modifying the film with lignin
and these differences in roughness resulted in decreasing the contact
angle of these two types of film. This roughness was only observed
on the airside of the film, as shown in Figure 7, which has been subjected to the water evaporation
during the drying process.4 The same pattern
was also observed by other researchers who modified the structure
of SPI and chitosan film with lignin using extrusion and solvent casting,
respectively, and the addition of lignin resulted in a fluctuant fracture
surface.12,25 Shankar et al.26 created agar films with different lignin contents (3, 5, and 10
g/100 g), and they reported that film surface roughness increased
with increasing lignin content. At lower concentrations of lignin
(3 and 5 g/100 g), the lignin was dispersed uniformly; however, films
containing 10 g/100 g lignin seemed to have more agglomerated lignin
on the surface.

and plateside
surfaces of control and the modified enzyme-treated films with lignosulfonate
(LSS) and alkali lignin (AL), lignin%: g/100 g.

Mechanical Properties
Tensile strength (TS) and percent
elongation (%E) of enzymatically modified film with
two types of lignin are shown in Table 4. The addition of alkali lignin (6 and 10 g/100 g)
increased the TS of SPI-modified films to around 2 times higher than
the control film, whereas elongation decreased as a function of lignin
concentration. Conversely, percent elongation in films containing
6 and 10 g/100 g AL dropped significantly compared to the control
film. This finding implies that AL produced more disruption in the
protein matrix than LSS, also agreeing with rheological behavior,
the FTIR spectra, and XRD patterns. Increasing the concentration of
LSS to over 2 g/100 g improved TS of SPI films. The addition of 2
g/100 g LSS did not change TS and %E of the modified
films compared to the control film. This consistency might be attributed
to the high compatibility and negligible effect of LSS at 2 g/100
g in the protein matrix. According to the technical data sheet from
the producer, the glass transition temperature (Tg) of AL is higher than LSS (Tg of AL is 160 °C and LSS is 140 °C), which indicates the
films containing AL might be glassier than LSS-based films at testing
temperature. Huang et al.,11 who modified
the structure of soy protein with different ratios of LSS using a
melt extrusion method, reported similar patterns to our observation.
Shankar et al.,26 who modified the structure
of agar film with different percentages of
lignin (1, 3, 5, and 10 g/100 g) with solvent casting reported that
the addition of lignin improved TS and reduced %E of films. This group also found that films with 3% lignin showed
the highest TS, whereas higher concentration of lignin caused agglomeration
and nonuniform dispersion that had a negative effect on the TS of
films. Núñez-Flores et al.4 reported that the addition of a low concentration of lignin (0.6
g/100 mL in the solution) dropped TS and improved %E of fish gelatin-based films plasticized with 15% glycerol and 15%
sorbitol. They reported that lignin produced plasticizing effects
on fish gelatin film and it increased %E and reduced
TS. The same pattern was also achieved by Espinoza Acosta et al.,18 who modified wheat starch structures with lignin,
and the addition of lignin significantly reduced TS but increased
%E. Accordingly, we observed that lignin acts as
a reinforcing agent in enzymatically modified SPI matrix.

Thermogravimetric Analysis
(TGA) of Films
Thermal analysis
techniques, such as TGA, provide information on the thermal stability
of biopolymer films. As shown in Figure 8, modified films with lignin (both AL and
LSS) showed higher thermal stability compared to the control film
based on changes in onset temperatures at around 150 and 50 °C,
respectively. The first weight loss might be attributed to the evaporation
of water from the films. Both AL and LSS showed similar trends in
the TGA graph. The second weight loss, which is a result of polymer
decomposition, occurred at around 300 °C in films containing
lignin, whereas the second weight loss for the control (SPI film)
occurred at around 275 °C. The addition of lignin improved the
thermal stability of SPI polymer film due to the interaction between
lignin and polymer molecules. Espinoza Acosta et al.18 reported that the modified structure of durum wheat starch
with lignin showed a second weight loss (decomposition) at a lower
temperature than the control due to the discontinuity of the starch
matrix after the addition of lignin. This discrepancy may be the result
from the miscibility between lignin and the polymer matrix.

(LSS) and alkali lignin (AL) on thermal
stability of enzymatically modified SPI film, lignin%: g/100 g.

Contact Angles of the Films
Contact angle is a helpful
measurement to determine wettability and surface hydrophobicity of
biopolymer films. The contact angles of both airside and plateside
of films modified with two types of lignin are shown in Table 5. We expected that the incorporation
of lignin may increase the hydrophobicity of SPI films due to the
enzymatic reaction between lignin and the polymer. Interestingly,
the treatment did not show higher contact angles for both film sides,
which would have suggested greater surface hydrophobicity than the
control (p > 0.05). In our previous research,24 it was found that the enzymatic modification
of SPI film increased surface hydrophobicity due to the influence
of hydrophobic groups of SPI, which were initially hidden in the inside
of the molecule. However, the addition of lignin reduced the surface
hydrophobicity of enzymatically modified SPI films, in both airside
and plateside. This reduction in surface hydrophobicity was due to
physical interactions of hydrophobic amino acids with the lignin and
accelerated the exposure of hydrophilic units of protein on the surface
of the film.27 The contact angle of the
plateside was lower compared to that of the control and the airside
due to the surface roughness induced by molecules arrangement during
the drying process. This difference in the roughness of plateside
and airside of films coincides with SEM images (Figure 7). There was no significant difference among
different concentrations of lignin in the film (p < 0.05). The similar result was reported by Košíková
et al.,25 where the addition of lignin
reduced surface hydrophobicity and contact angle of PP film as a function
of lignin concentration.

Water Absorption Properties
Water sensitivity is one
of the main limitations of bioplastics. The effect of different types
of lignin on the water absorption properties of enzymatically modified
SPI film is shown in Table 5. Films modified with AL had approximately 100% higher water
absorption compared to the films modified with LSS. Water absorption
results were aligned to what we observed previously in viscosity,
FTIR, and XRD graphs (Figures 2, 5, and 6)
where AL resulted in more interference in enzymatically modified SPI
matrix compared to LSS. The addition of LSS at different concentrations
did not have a significant effect (p > 0.05) on
the
water absorption of the modified films after 2 h swelling in buffer
solution at pH 7. Similar results were observed by Oliviero et al.,8 who modified the structure of zein protein with
AL and LSS using a melt extrusion method, and they observed that modifying
zein protein structure with LSS did not have a significant effect
on the water uptake capacity of films. However, AL reduced water absorption
of the modified film, which was due to the decrease in the concentration
of hydrophilic amino acids regarding the interaction of OH and SH
groups of AL with amino acids. Huang et al.12 reported that the addition of LSS to the SPI matrix dramatically
reduced water absorption to around 80% in films containing 40 parts
LSS; their films were prepared by compression molding. They suggested
that sulfonic acid groups of LSS formed a cross-linked network in
the SPI matrix. In our experiment, LSS showed good miscibility in
enzymatically modified SPI films and LSS did not have a significant
effect on the water absorption or contact angle properties of enzymatically
modified SPI films (specially at concentration of 2 and 4 g/100 g),
which was comparable to what we observed in FTIR spectra.

Water Vapor
Permeability
The effect of type and concentration
of lignin on water vapor permeability of modified SPI films is shown
in Table 4. The addition
of lignin to enzymatically modified SPI film improved water vapor
barrier properties up to approximately 50% compared to the control
film. However, there was not a significant difference between WVP
of modified films with AL and LSS (p > 0.05).
The
composite film of agar/lignin revealed reducing WVP with increasing
lignin concentration to 10 g/100 g.26 The
lignin may be acting as a filler that provides a high barrier properties
to the film. Opposing results were observed by Núñez-Flores
et al.,4 who modified the structure of
fish gelatin-based film with two types of lignin, that the mixture
of gelatin to lignin at the ratio of 85:15 increased water vapor permeability
to nearly 50%, which was due to either the water-induced plasticization
effect of lignin or poor compatibility of lignin with gelatin.

Conclusions
As raw materials, alkali lignin (AL) and lignosulfonate (LSS) showed
significant radical scavenging activity compared to commercial BHT,
which carry strong potentials in use for active packaging structure.
Films containing AL showed strong UV-blocking ability induced by the
natural color of lignin. On the basis of FTIR and XRD spectra, the
secondary structures of SPI matrix can be altered by the addition
of lignin and transglutaminase treatment. Mechanical properties and
thermal stability of films containing lignin were significantly changed
compared to the control films without lignin. This implies that the
common limitations of biopolymeric film in packaging, such as poor
mechanical properties and poor thermal properties, may be minimized
or solved by utilizing lignin and enzymatic treatment, while offering
an additional potential in functionality, such as antioxidant activity
derived from lignin.

Experimental Section
Materials
Soy
protein isolate (PROFAM 974) with 90%
protein, on a dry basis, was supplied by Archer Daniels Midland company
Protein Specialties Division, Netherlands. SPI had 5% moisture, 4%
fat, and 5% ash. Transglutaminase (Activa RM) was donated by Ajinomoto,
Japan. According to the data sheet provided by the company, Activa
RM contains 99.5% sodium caseinate and maltodextrin and 0.5% enzyme.
On the basis of our preliminary study, measured activity of the enzyme
was 47.8 unit per gram of enzyme.24 Glycerol
and alkali lignin (code 370959) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Calcium lignosulfonate was donated from Green
Agrochem, grade one, Jinan, China. Reagents for enzyme activity measurements
such as Tris–HCl, Tris-acetate buffer, CaCl2, glutathione,
hydroxylamine, CBZ-glutaminylglycine, l-glutamic acid γ-monohydroxamate,
and FeCl3-trichloroacetic were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Citric acid, ethanol, methanol, BHT, and phosphoric acid were obtained
from Fisher Scientific. 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) was obtained
from Sigma Chemical Co.

Antioxidant Activity of Lignin Material
Antioxidant
activities of different lignins (AL and LSS) were determined on the
basis of the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method and according
to radical scavenging ability of lignin material at pH 7. The assay
was carried out as described by Brand-Williams et al.28 with some modifications. Six different concentrations of
lignin solution in methanol ranging from 0 to 800 μg/mL were
prepared, and 0.06 mM DPPH solution in methanol was added to each
antioxidant solution and the value of absorbance at 517 nm was measured
using a GENESYS 10S UV–vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Butylated hydroxyltoluene (BHT) was used as a reference.
Radical scavenging activity of each antioxidant was expressed from
the graph by linear regression of absorbance versus concentration.

Film Preparation
Enzymatically modified soy protein
isolate-based film was prepared by dissolving 5 g of SPI in 100 mL
of distilled water with glycerol 30 g/100 g of SPI, according to the
preliminary study. Lignin solution (2, 4, 6, and 10 g/100 g of SPI)
and enzyme solution (4 U/g of protein) were prepared separately and
added to the final solution under a specific pH condition. Maximum
solubility of alkali lignin was at pH 10–11. The pH of water-soluble
lignosulfonate was adjusted to pH 7 with sodium hydroxide 50 g/100
g. After heating SPI solution at 80 °C in 30 min, the solution
was cooled down to 40 °C and incubated with the lignin for 1
h. Transglutaminase was added to the solution and incubated at the
same temperature condition for another 2 h. Solution (100 g) was weighed
and casted on Teflon-coated glass plates (20 × 20 cm2) to produce the consistency of thickness in all samples and dried
at room temperature for 24 h and carefully peeled off manually. The
films were then preconditioned at 25 °C and 50% relative humidity
(RH) for 2–3 days before analysis according to ASTM D618-61.29

Rheology of Film-Forming Solutions
The effect of lignin
on the rheological properties of enzymatically modified SPI film-forming
solution with 7.5 g/100 g of solid content was determined using a
rotational rheometer (AR G2, TA Instrument Ltd., New Castle, DE) with
a conical concentric cylinder (30.2 mm diameter and 78.4 mm length
and a geometry with 28.1 mm diameter and 80.8 mm length). This is
according to the method described by Gauche et al.30 The measurements were replicated three times for each sample,
and the data were evaluated using the Origin software, version 9.0
(Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, MA). The temperature of rheometer
was controlled by Brookfield temperature controller with nitrogen
gas to set 25 °C. The sample was preconditioned at 25 °C
for 2 min to ensure stability. The shear rate increased linearly from
1 to 1000 s–1 with 8 points per decade in a steady
state flow rate. The viscosity of the SPI solution was expressed by
Pa s.

DPPH Free Radical Scavenging Test of Films
Radical
scavenging activity of film samples with and without lignin was determined
according to the method described by Yen et al.31 with a slight modification. A rectangular piece of soy
protein-based film (1 cm2) with and without lignin was
soaked into 5 mL of DPPH 0.05 mM in methanol. These film samples are
insoluble in methanol-based solution; however, lignins are soluble
and they change the light absorbency of methanol solution. The solution
was shaken at room temperature and in the dark for 2 h. The absorbance
of the solution was determined in 517 nm by a GENESYS 10S UV–vis
spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Radical scavenging activity
of films was calculated according to the following equation  where Asample is
the absorbance of sample and Acontrol is
the absorbance of control, which is the film without lignin.

Color
and Opacity of Films
The color of film surface
was measured using a Konica Minolta (CR-200; Minolta Co. Ltd., Osaka,
Japan). Prior to analysis, the colorimeter was calibrated to standard
black and white tiles. Five different parts of film samples were measured,
and the mean and standard deviation were recorded. The color scale
was included L-value, from 0 to 100, a-value, and b-value, from negative to positive scales.

Opacity of films was measured by the GENESYS 10S UV–vis
spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and according to a method
described by Núñez-Flores et al.4 The films were cut into a rectangle piece and directly placed into
a cuvette. An empty cuvette was used as the reference. The opacity
of films was calculated by the equation O = Abs600/X, where Abs600 is the value of absorbance at 600 nm and X is the thickness of the film. Results were obtained in
triplicate.

Film UV-Blocking Measurements
UV
absorbance of the
films was measured by the UV–vis spectrometer (Shimadzu 2550
UV–vis spectrometer spectrum, Kyoto, Japan) with a wavelength
range of 200–800 nm.

Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
Fourier
Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed with an 8700
Nicolet Thermo Electron, with transmission mode and a resolution of
4 cm–1, in the range of 4000–500 cm–1. The number of scans for background was 32 and for the sample was
96. The samples were preconditioned in a dissector containing P2O5 for a week to achieve the lowest moisture content.
To see the effect of lignin on secondary structure of protein matrix,
the absorbance region between 1800 and 1400 cm–1 was deconvoluted by OriginPro, version 9.0 (Microcal Software Inc.,
Northampton, MA) using the best fit by R2 > 99% to specify the position of the peaks to correspond to the
different secondary conformations of protein matrix.8

X-ray Diffraction
To analyze the
crystalline structure
of enzymatically modified SPI-based film with and without the lignin,
X-ray diffraction was performed by XRD (Bruker D8 Discover) from 2θ
values of 5–50° at the rate of 0.1 s/step and equipped
with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm).

Environmental
Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM)
The
surface of film samples was coated with gold 60:40 gold–palladium
mixture deposited by Cressington 208HR coater. The samples were tested
with FEI Quanta 600 FEG, Oregon.

Mechanical Properties
For determination of tensile
strength (TS) and percent elongation (%E), the ASTM
D88232 method was used and evaluated by
TA.XTPLUS texture analyzer (Stable Micro Systems, Surrey, U.K.) with
50 kg loading capacity. The films were cut in rectangles 2.5 ×
8 cm2 and put in the environmental chamber (50% RH and
23 °C) for 2 days before the analysis. The samples were fixed
between the grips with an initial grip separation of 5 cm and pulled
apart at cross head speed of 50 mm/min. Tensile strength was determined
by dividing the peak load (N) to the cross-sectional area (m2), and the results were expressed using MPa. The percent elongation
was calculated by dividing the extended length by the initial length
multiplied by 100.

Surface Hydrophobicity
The surface
hydrophobicity of
enzymatically modified films activated with different levels of lignin
was assessed by measuring the contact angle (FTA 200; Dynamic Contact
Angle Analyzer, Portsmouth, VA). A drop of 1 μL of distilled
water at the rate of 0.3 μL/s was placed on the surface of the
film with an automatic piston syringe (100 μL) and photographed.
Initial contact angle was measured after 0.3 s to minimize the noise
in the picture. The method is based on image processing and curve
fitting for contact angle according to measuring the contact angle
between the baseline of the drop and the tangent of drop boundary.
The contact angles were measured on both sides of the drop and the
average recorded.

Water Absorption Properties
Water
absorption property
of the modified films at pH 7 was determined according to the ASTM
D57033 method. The films were cut to 25
× 25 mm2 and preconditioned at environmental chamber
for 2 days and dried in an oven at 50 °C for 24 h before the
analysis. Dry samples were weighted (w1) by AG104 Mettler Toledo with 0.1 mg precision. Then, they were
immersed in 0.1 M sodium phosphate dibasic solution and the pH was
adjusted with NaOH 50 g/100 g to 7 at 25 °C for 2 h. The wet
samples were then wiped with filter paper to remove extra water and
weighed (w2). Swelling (%) calculated
by the following equation  

Thermogravimetric
Analysis (TGA)
Thermal decomposition
of modified SPI-based films with lignin was measured using a TA Q500
thermogravimetric analyzer (TA Instrument Inc., New Castle, DE) at
a heating rate of 10 °C/min from 25 to 800 °C under nitrogen
gas. Film samples were preconditioned in a desiccator containing P2O5 for a week to achieve the lowest moisture content.
A palladium pan was used for the experiment.

Water Vapor Permeability
(WVP)
Water vapor permeability
coefficients (WVP, g cm/(cm2 s Pa)) of the films were measured
with i-Hydro 7500 Water Vapor Transmission Rate Testing System (Labthink
Instruments Co., Ltd., China) according to an internal standard ISO
15106-3 with the electrolytic detection sensor method.34 The thicknesses of the three parts of each film
were measured by the micrometer and then averaged by thickness of
each film. The WVP coefficient of each film was calculated using the
equation  where WVTR is water vapor transmission rate
(g/m2·24 h) through the film and x indicates the mean thickness of each films (μm). Δp (Pa) is the difference in water vapor partial pressure
between the two sides (a dry chamber and controlled humidity chamber)
of the film. Each film (7 cm × 7 cm) was attached between two
sides of the punched aluminum plates. The diameter of the punched
area on the plates was 5.08 cm. The actual test area of WVP was 3.5
cm × 3.5 cm based on the exposed punched area of the plates.
The aluminum plate containing the film was inserted in the cell chamber
and closed tight. The flow rate was adjusted to 100 mL/min, and the
test relative humidity and temperature were controlled at 50 ±
2% and at 23.5 °C, receptively. The standard testing mode was
programmed with four cycles testing mode for each cell chamber. Each
test time interval per a cycle was 30 min. Before four cycles of each
test were started, the zero purging for 60 min was conducted.

Factorial
Design and Statistical Analysis
Enzymatically
modified soy protein isolate was activated with lignin in different
concentrations. Two factors: lignin type (AL and LSS) and lignin concentration
(0, 2, 4, 6, and 10 g/100 g) were determined. Therefore, there were
10 treatments. Each type of film was prepared three times, and each
film replicated five times for mechanical test and three times for
surface hydrophobicity and swelling properties. In total, 15 replicates
for the mechanical test and 9 replicates for the others were done.

All data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance to determine
the difference between samples. The Minitab Software model 14.12.0
(Minitab Inc., State College, PA) was applied. Tukey test was used
to carry out the difference of means between pairs with 95% confidence
interval.
