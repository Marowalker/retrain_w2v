Nitrogen-doped
graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) were decorated on
a three-dimensional (3D) MoS2–reduced graphene oxide
(rGO) framework via a facile hydrothermal method. The distribution
of N-GQDs on the 3D MoS2–rGO framework was confirmed
using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray elemental
mapping, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy techniques.
The resultant 3D nanohybrid was successfully demonstrated as an efficient
electrocatalyst toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under alkaline
conditions. The chemical interaction between the electroactive N-GQDs
and MoS2–rGO and the increased surface area and
pore size of the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid synergistically
improved the ORR onset potential to +0.81 V vs reversible hydrogen
electrode (RHE). Moreover, the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid
showed better ORR stability for up to 3000 cycles with negligible
deviation in the half-wave potential (E1/2). Most importantly, the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid
exhibited a superior methanol tolerance ability even under a high
concentration of methanol (3.0 M) in alkaline medium. Hence, the development
of a low-cost metal-free graphene quantum dot-based 3D nanohybrid
with high methanol tolerance may open up a novel strategy to design
selective cathode electrocatalysts for direct methanol fuel cell applications.

1 Introduction
Zero-dimensional
(0D) graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with tunable
electrical and optical properties have been considered to be impressive
candidates for diverse applications including solar cells, light-emitting
diodes, photocatalysts, biomedical imaging, capacitors, batteries,
sensors, and fuel cells.1−8 Recently, several advancements have been made in both theoretical
and experimental studies to explore the intrinsic properties of various
heteroatom-doped GQDs for electrocatalytic applications.1,9 Previous reports reveal that the substitution of N atoms with GQDs
could alter the electronic structure and offer more active sites for
the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells.10−12 Qu et al. have
synthesized N-doped GQDs (N-GQDs) with oxygen-rich functionalities,
which exhibited superior electrocatalytic reactivity toward ORR.1 Yet another report demonstrated the influence
of the size of N-GQDs on ORR, and it showed that increasing the N-GQD
size leads to an increase in the current density.13 Similarly, N-GQDs were synthesized using an electrochemical
method, and their size-dependent electrocatalytic activity for ORR
was also evaluated.14

To utilize
the potential properties of N-GQDs toward ORR, N-GQD-based
hybrid electrocatalysts have also been developed recently.10,15 In particular, the incorporation of N-GQDs on different carbon supports
has attracted significant attention to fabricate alternative highly
efficient electrocatalysts for ORR.10,16 Among various
carbon supports, graphene has been considered a promising support
because of its exceptional physiochemical properties such as high
specific surface area, high carrier mobility, excellent electrical
conductivity, and good chemical stability.17−24 Recently, boron- and nitrogen-doped GQDs were anchored on graphene
platelets using a hydrothermal method and demonstrated to be an efficient
electrocatalyst for ORR.15 Similarly, a
novel class of GQD-decorated graphene nanoribbon was prepared through
a one-step reduction reaction for ORR.25 Likewise, microwave-assisted functionalization of GQDs with the
N and S codoped graphene electrocatalyst exhibited an excellent methanol
tolerance property.26 Very recently, N-GQDs/graphene
nanocomposites have been prepared using a facile self-assembly method
and employed as an efficient electrocatalyst for ORR.27 The N-rich carbon dot-incorporated graphene electrocatalyst
prepared via one-pot synthesis showed a superior methanol tolerance
property in an alkaline environment.28

In addition, two-dimensional (2D) metal chalcogenides, especially
molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), have also been demonstrated
to be potential candidates for ORR because of their unique properties
such as large surface area and high electrical conductivity.29,30 However, the electrocatalytic activity of MoS2 can be
further improved by modification with different carbon supports. Recent
studies have confirmed that the electrocatalytic behavior of the catalysts
also depends on their morphological structure such as shape and size.31 In particular, assembling 2D nanosheets into
3D nanostructures offers a porous structure with a large surface area
and high electrical conductivity. The electrocatalytic performance
of the 3D nanocomposite was higher compared with those of the catalysts
with other dimensions such as 1D and 2D.32 Recently, MoS2–reduced graphene oxide (MoS2–rGO) nanocomposites have been synthesized using a
hydrothermal method and have been used as efficient electrocatalysts
for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), ORR, and lithium-ion batteries.32−35 In the present study, we have designed N-GQD-decorated MoS2–rGO with a 3D framework via a simple hydrothermal method
as displayed in Scheme 1. This is the first report using N-GQDs along with MoS2–rGO for ORR. The N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO showed
a 3D hierarchical framework with crumpled surfaces and edges. The
resultant nanohybrid not only exhibited a better ORR onset potential
of +0.81 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under
an O2-saturated KOH solution but also showed an excellent
methanol tolerance property at a high methanol concentration. Thus,
these properties make this newly prepared N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO
nanohybrid a potential selective cathode electrocatalyst for direct
methanol fuel cell applications.

2 Results and Discussion
UV–visible absorption spectra of N-GQDs, GO, MoS2, MoS2–rGO, and N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO
dispersed in deionized (DI) water are displayed in Figure 1. The N-GQDs exhibit a characteristic
optical absorption peak at 348 nm.5 This
intense absorption peak is mainly attributed to the n → π*
transition that occurs in the C=O bond of N-GQDs.4 Moreover, the N-GQDs show strong blue luminescence
in the presence of UV light (365 nm). This result indicates the formation
of uniform sized N-GQDs. Likewise, an absorption peak noted at <300
nm for MoS2, MoS2–rGO, and N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO is assigned to the excitonic features of small-sized
MoS2 nanosheets.36 However,
no absorption peak is observed for N-GQDs, which might be due to the
low content of N-GQDs present in the resultant nanohybrid. On the
other hand, a relatively high content of the black colored MoS2–rGO present in the resultant N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO can shield the photons coming into the N-GQDs.37 This effect is commonly known as “light
shielding effect”.37,38 A similar phenomenon
was also observed earlier for melamine-functionalized 3D graphene
sheets with CdS in photocatalytic applications.37

Figure 1 UV–vis absorption spectra of N-GQDs (inset: digital photograph
of N-GQDs illuminated with a 365 nm, 8 W UV lamp), GO, MoS2, MoS2–rGO, and N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO.

The morphological structure of
the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO
nanohybrid was examined using FE-SEM analysis. The prepared graphene
oxide (GO) and MoS2 alone showed a well-defined 2D sheetlike
morphology (Figure S1). As shown in Figure 2b, the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid exhibits a typical 3D framework with
wrinkled surfaces and edges. This indicates that a few layers of crumpled
rGO sheets are folded with MoS2 sheets forming a 3D nanostructure.
Thus, MoS2–rGO prepared with the 3D nanostructure
can provide a high surface area for the loading of N-GQDs. Figure 2c–h gives
the individual elemental mapping of the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO
nanohybrid. Only expected elements such
as Mo, S, C, O, and N are identified in the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid. The N element observed in N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO reconfirms the existence of N-GQDs. Similarly,
the EDX profile also shows only the Mo, S, C, O, and N elements in
the synthesized nanohybrid (Figure S2).

N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid and the corresponding

Figure 3a,b shows
the TEM images of N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO with different
magnifications. The resultant N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO exhibits
a typical 3D architecture with wrinkled surfaces or edges (Figure 3a). Thus, the obtained
TEM image is similar to the FE-SEM image (Figure 2b). It is also interesting to note that the
MoS2 nanosheets and rGO sheets are intercalated with each
other, which results in the formation of a 3D MoS2–rGO
nanostructure (Figure 3b). Moreover, HR-TEM studies are carried out to further confirm the
incorporation of N-GQDs on the MoS2–rGO framework.
As depicted in Figure 3d,e, the marked lattice fringe values of 0.24 and 0.64 nm are assigned
to the (1120) plane of the graphitic quantum dots and the (002) plane
of MoS2, respectively.5,39 The observed
(1120) crystal plane corresponding to the graphitic quantum dots clearly
discloses the successful incorporation of N-GQDs on the MoS2–rGO nanohybrid. XRD studies were performed to identify the
crystalline nature of the 3D hybrid. As displayed in Figure 3f, a broad diffraction peak
observed at 2θ = 25° is related to the (002) crystal plane
of rGO, and the corresponding d-spacing value is
estimated to be 0.35 nm.40 Moreover, two
distinct diffraction peaks noted at the 2θ values of 32.5°
and 57° are assigned to the (100) and (110) planes of MoS2. This result clearly indicates the well-ordered atomic arrangements
of MoS2 along the basal planes.41 More importantly, two additional peaks appeared at a low-angle region,
that is, 2θ = 8.8° and 17.7°, which clearly suggests
the formation of a lamellar nanostructure of MoS2 with
enlarged d-spacing values of 1 and 0.5 nm, respectively
(JCPDS Card #: 73-1508).42 It is worth
mentioning that the oxygen functionalities of GO that intercalated
between the MoS2 sheet results in an increase in the d-spacing value (1 nm) of the nanohybrid compared to that
of pristine MoS2 reported elsewhere.32,42

nanohybrid.

Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectra of GO, MoS2–rGO, and N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO are displayed
in Figure 4. GO shows
absorption peaks at 3443, 1733, 1627, 1386, 1220, and 1107 cm–1, which are assigned to the O–H, C=O,
C=C, C–O (carboxyl), C–OH, and C–O (alkoxy)
groups, respectively.43−45 The decrease in the peak intensity of the oxygen-rich
functional groups present in MoS2–rGO and the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid suggests the successful reduction of
GO to rGO.46 Moreover, a peak centered
at 605 cm–1 of MoS2–rGO and the
N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid corresponds to the Mo–S
vibration.47 In addition, a peak that appears
at 1040 cm–1 of N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO
is assigned to the C–N bond present in N-GQDs.48

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried
out
to investigate the chemical nature and identify the elements present
in the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid. Figure 5a shows the XPS survey scan
spectrum of the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid. The
predominant peaks identified at 162.5, 230.5, 284.4, 395.4, and 531.8
eV correspond to S 2p, Mo 3d, C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s core-level spectra,
respectively. Two peaks identified at 228.6 and 231.8 eV for the high-resolution
Mo 3d spectra are assigned to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2, respectively (Figure 5b).49 The spin energy difference between
the core levels of Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 is
measured to be 3.1 eV, which indicates the Mo4+ oxidation
state of Mo in N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO.50 In addition, a small peak located at 226 eV is related
to S 2s.32 In the high-resolution S 2p
spectrum, S 2p and −SOn–
peaks noted at 162 and 168 eV indicate the presence of sulfur species
in N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO (Figure 5c).49,51,52 The high-resolution C 1s spectrum can be deconvoluted into four
components (Figure 5d). The most intense peaks observed at 284.4 and 285.7 eV are related
to the C–C/C=C and sp3 carbon atoms or C–N
bonds, respectively.4,5 It is worth noting that the C=N
bond observed at 285.1 eV confirms the presence of N-GQDs in the resultant
nanohybrid.53 Moreover, a relatively minor
component occurred at 287.6 eV, which further indicates the significant
reduction in oxygen-rich functionalities present in GO.20 As shown in Figure 5e, the high-resolution N 1s spectrum is deconvoluted
into four components. The main peak centered at 394.7 eV is related
to Mo 3p3/2, whereas the rest of the peaks noted at 396.6,
399.8, and 401.5 eV correspond to Mo–N, pyrolic-N, and graphitic-N,
respectively. Therefore, the different types of C–N bond formation
observed in the N 1s spectra confirm the successful incorporation
of N-GQDs on the 3D MoS2–rGO framework.5,50,54

scan, (b) Mo 3d, (c)
S 2p, and (d) C 1s and (e) N 1s core-level spectra of N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO.

The surface area and porosity of the MoS2–rGO
and N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrids were investigated
using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis (Figure 6). As shown in Figure 6a,b, both MoS2–rGO and N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrids
exhibit a typical type (IV) isotherm pattern, which indicates the
mesoporous nature of the catalysts.55 The
calculated BET surface areas of the MoS2–rGO and
N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrids are calculated to be
30.3 and 36.4 m2/g, respectively. The pore size distributions
of the MoS2–rGO and N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO
nanohybrids are estimated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) method, as shown in the inset of Figure 6a,b. The average pore sizes of the MoS2–rGO and N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrids
are 3.1 and 6 nm, respectively. These results suggest that the incorporation
of N-GQDs on MoS2–rGO using a hydrothermal method
can enhance the surface area and the pore size of the resultant nanohybrid.55 The increased pore size of the N-GQD-loaded
MoS2–rGO monohybrid is consistent with the FE-SEM
image of the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid (Figure 2b). Moreover, the
increased surface area and pore size of the N-GQD-incorporated 3D
MoS2–rGO framework can offer more catalytic active
sites for effective electrochemical reactions.56

nanohybrid and their respective pore size distributions (insets).

The electrocatalytic activity
of the 3D N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO
nanohybrid-modified electrode was investigated for ORR activity in
0.1 M KOH using the three-electrode system. Figure 7a shows the CVs observed for the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid-modified electrode in N2- and O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH in the potential range of
0–1.2 V vs RHE. A featureless CV response occurred when the
electrolyte solution was saturated with N2. By contrast,
a strong cathodic reduction peak was observed under an O2-saturated environment, suggesting the electrocatalytic reduction
of oxygen. As shown in Figure 7b, an increase in the current density with respect to the
rotation speed is due to the enhanced diffusion of dissolved oxygen
molecules through the porous channel of the 3D N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid-modified electrode.15 Moreover, the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid catalyst
exhibits the most positive ORR onset potential of +0.81 V vs RHE and
a current density of 2.56 mA/cm2 at 1600 rpm (Figure 7b). In addition,
the number of electrons transferred per oxygen molecule in the ORR
process was also calculated using the Koutecky–Levich plot.
A plot of J–1 vs ω–1/2 was
obtained from the corresponding K–L equation (eq 1).22 1  where i is the measured current, ik is the kinetic
current, id = Bω1/2 is the diffusion-limiting
current, B is
Levich constant, and ω is the rotational speed of the electrode
(eq 2). Also 2  where n is the number
of
electrons transferred per O2 molecule, F is the Faraday constant (96 486 C mol–1), A is the geometric area of the working electrode, DO2 is the diffusion coefficient of
the O2 molecule (1.9 × 10–5 cm2 s–1) in 0.1 M KOH, v is
the kinematic viscosity of the electrolyte (1.9 × 10–5 cm2 s–1), and CO2 is the concentration of the O2 molecule
(1.2 × 10–6 mol L–1).22,57

yield for the 3D N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid at the
whole potential range obtained from the rotating ring disc electrode
(RRDE) voltammogram, as displayed in Figure S3.

Figure 7c shows
the linear fitting, and the average number of electrons transferred
(n) for N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO is calculated
to be about two with different potential regions, indicating the typical
two-electron transfer process. The number of electrons (n) transferred in the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid
can be obtained using a well-known procedure based on the RRDE assembly
using the percentage of peroxide formation. As shown in Figure 7d, RRDE measurements are taken
to deduce n, which is found to be between 3.2 and
3.8 in the potential region of 0.8–0 V vs RHE. On the other
hand, the Koutecky–Levich approach suggests a two-electron
transfer process for the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid,
indicating two different electron transfer mechanisms for ORR in the
present case.

The comparative LSV curves of MoS2–rGO,
N-GQDs/rGO,
N-GQDs/MoS2, and N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO at the
rotation speed of 1600 rpm are depicted in Figure 8a. Interestingly, the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid exhibits an excellent ORR activity with the
positive onset potential of +0.81 V along with the current density
of 2.56 mA/cm2. On the basis of electrochemical results
and chemical nature/functionalities of the N-GQDs and MoS2–rGO, the following explanation can be provided. In the present
work, N-GQDs play a crucial role toward ORR. Electrochemically active
sites on N-GQDs in conjunction with the network of MoS2–rGO furnish improved sites for oxygen adsorption and its
conversion. This effect is also clearly seen in Figure 8a, where a positive shift in the onset potential,
an improved mixed diffusion and kinetic current and diffusion-controlled
region is achieved. Thus, a synergistic effect between N-GQDs and
MoS2–rGO plays an important role in electrochemical
activity. In addition, a larger surface area and pore size in the
case of nanohybrid structures (Figure 6) can offer better catalytic active sites on the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid for effective electrochemical reactions.
Moreover, a few recent reports also suggest a synergistic effect in
the 3D MoS2–rGO nanocomposite toward various catalytic
processes.49,53 The LSV curves of MoS2–rGO-, N-GQDs/rGO-, and N-GQDs/MoS2-modified electrodes
with different rotation speeds ranging from 400 to 2500 rpm are displayed
in Figure 8b–d.
As shown in Figure 8a–d, LSVs of all nanocomposites show two components, one at
0.1 V and another at 0.5 V. These two components are mainly due to
a two-step ORR process. The comparison of electrocatalytic performance
of some carbonaceous-based electrocatalysts for the ORR process is
summarized in Table S1.

Figure 8 (a) Comparative LSV curves
of N-GQDs/MoS2-, N-GQDs/rGO-,
MOS2–rGO-, and N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO-modified
electrodes in the presence of O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH at

electrode in the presence of O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution
at various rotation speeds in the range of 400–2500 rpm.

The stability of the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid
was evaluated for up to 3000 continuous cycles between −0.5
and −0.1 V (vs Ag/AgCl), at a scan rate of 20 mV/s in the O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. The recorded comparative CVs
and LSVs before and after the cycling tests are shown in Figure 9a,b, respectively.
Importantly, the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid shows
no obvious change in its CV curve after 3000 cycles (Figure 9a). In addition, the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid exhibits only a 27 mV deviation in
the half-wave potential (E1/2) for up
to 3000 cycles (Figure 9b). Thus, the observed results clearly reveal better stability of
the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid under alkaline conditions.

and after 3000 cycles with a scan rate of 20 mV/s in the O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution and (b) ORR polarization curves of

in the presence and absence of 3 M methanol, with a sweep rate of
100 mV/s in 0.1 M KOH.

To determine
the methanol tolerance ability of the resultant nanohybrid, ORR was
performed at a high concentration of methanol (3.0 M) in 0.1 M KOH
solution and compared with commercial Pt/C (20 wt %) under similar
experimental conditions.1,58Figure 9c,d displays the electrocatalytic activity
of the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid and Pt/C in the
presence and absence of methanol. As shown in Figure 9c, the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO
catalyst exhibits almost similar voltammograms with a strong cathodic
peak even at a higher concentration of methanol (3.0 M), suggesting
the excellent methanol tolerance property of the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid. By contrast, Pt/C shows a substantial oxidation
peak in the presence of methanol (3.0 M) under identical experimental
conditions (Figure 9d). Thus, the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid with selective
electrocatalytic property toward ORR could be used to replace commercial
Pt/C as a cathode catalyst in a direct methanol fuel cell.

Scheme 2 represents
the schematic illustration of the ORR process on the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid-modified electrode. The 3D architecture
of N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO with a highly porous structure
provides more catalytic active sites to adsorb oxygen molecules. Thus,
resulting in the better oxygen adsorption of the nanohybrid and the
synergistic role of N-GQDs and MoS2–rGO enhanced
the ORR activity.

3 Conclusions
A 3D N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid was developed
and employed as an efficient electrocatalyst for ORR under an alkaline
atmosphere. The different types of C–N bonds observed in the
N 1s spectra confirmed the existence of N-GQDs on the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid. Moreover, incorporation of N-GQDs
on MoS2–rGO using the hydrothermal method increased
the surface area and the pore size of the resultant nanohybrid. N-GQDs
combined with MoS2–rGO synergistically enhanced
the ORR performance, with a maximum positive onset potential of +0.81
V versus RHE. The resultant N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO showed
better stability and an outstanding methanol tolerance property at
a high concentration of methanol (3.0 M) to resist the methanol crossover
effects in direct methanol fuel cells.

4 Experimental
Details
4.1 Chemicals
Graphite powder (synthetic,
conducting grade, 325 mesh, 99.99%) was procured from Alfa Aesar.
Ammonium molybdate, thioacetamide, citric acid, and ethylenediamine
were purchased from SRL Chemicals, India. All chemicals were used
without further purification.

4.2 Synthesis
of GO and N-GQDs
GO was
synthesized from graphite flakes using the modified Hummers’
method.59 N-GQDs were prepared using a
hydrothermal method.5 In brief, 1.68 g
of citric acid and 1.44 g of ethylenediamine were mixed in 40 mL of
DI water and stirred to get a clear solution. Then, the mixture was
transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 160
°C for 4 h. Finally, the product was collected through centrifugation
and redispersed in DI water.

4.3 Synthesis of the N-GQD-Decorated
3D MoS2–rGO Nanohybrid
The 3D N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid was prepared via a simple hydrothermal
method
(Scheme 1). In brief,
40 mg of GO was first dispersed in 40 mL of DI water and ultrasonicated
(Bath-type ultrasonicator, Labman-LMUC-25, operating frequency is
40 kHz, and the rated output power is 600 W) for 30 min to make a
homogeneous dispersion. Subsequently, 106 mg of ammonium molybdate
and 240 mg of thioacedamide were dissolved in 40 mL of DI water separately
and stirred for 30 min. Then, the predispersed GO solution was slowly
added into the above reaction mixture under constant stirring. Followed
by GO addition, 1 mL of the as-synthesized N-GQDs predispersed in
DI water was injected into the above reaction mixture and stirred
for 10 min. Afterward, the solution was placed in a 100 mL Teflon-lined
stainless steel autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 24 h in an
electric hot air oven. Finally,
the obtained fine black solids were washed several times with DI water
followed by washing with ethanol and dried at 80 °C overnight.
The resultant product was named the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO
nanohybrid. For comparison, MoS2–rGO, N-GQDs/MoS2, and N-GQDs/rGO were also synthesized under identical experimental
conditions.

4.4 Characterization Studies
UV–vis
absorption spectra were obtained using a Specord 200 plus spectrophotometer
(Analytikjena, Germany). XRD analysis was performed using a PANaltical
X’pert powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 1.5418 Å). The surface morphology, elemental mapping, and analysis
were examined by FE-SEM and EDX using an FEI Quanta FEG 200 high-resolution
scanning electron microscope. HR-TEM images were recorded using a
JEOL JEM 2100F transmission electron microscope. XPS measurements
were obtained using a Shimadzu ESCA 3100, and the FT-IR spectra were
recorded using an FTIR spectrophotometer (Agilent, Cary 660, USA).
The surface area and the pore size of the resultant electrocatalyst
were analyzed using a Quantachrome Nova-1000 surface analyzer.

4.5 Fabrication of a Modified Electrode and Electrochemical
Studies
The N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO nanohybrid-modified
glassy carbon (GC) electrode was fabricated as follows. Before the
electrode modification, the GC electrode was polished with alumina
slurry (0.05 micron). The N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO ink was
prepared by homogeneously dispersing 5 mg of sample into 3 mL of 24%
of isopropyl alcohol with 25 μL Nafion (5 wt%). Then, this mixture
was ultrasonicated for 30 min under ice-cold conditions. Finally,
4 μL of the as-prepared ink was carefully dropped on the well-cleaned
GC electrode surface and dried under an ethanol atmosphere. Before
the electrochemical measurement, the electrolyte solution was purged
with ultrapure N2 or O2 gas for up to 30 min
to achieve the saturation condition.

Electrochemical measurements were performed
using a CHI760E bipotentiostat workstation (CH Instruments, Inc.,
USA) with a typical three-electrode configuration using Pt wire and
Ag/AgCl (saturated in KCl) and modified GC (geometric area 0.0707
cm2) as the counter, reference, and working electrodes,
respectively. An aqueous solution of 0.1 M KOH was used as the electrolyte
throughout all electrochemical measurements. Finally, all measurements
were converted from Ag/AgCl to RHE (ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.998 V).22 The stability of the N-GQDs/MoS2–rGO
nanohybrid was evaluated up to 3000 cycles with a scan rate of 10
mV/s and a rotation speed of 1600 rpm in 0.1 KOH solution. In the
case of RRDE, the catalyst inks and electrodes were prepared in the
same manner as above for RDE measurements, with the only difference
in the amount of catalyst inks loaded on the disc electrode. In brief,
10 μL of catalyst inks was carefully dropped on the disc electrode
(diameter of 4 mm). In the RRDE measurements, the electrode was scanned
with a sweep rate of 10 mV/s, and the ring potential was fixed at
0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl. Equations 3 and 4 were used to calculate the peroxide
(% HO2–) yield and the number of electrons
transferred. 3   4  where ID is the
disc current, Ir is the ring current,
and N = 0.38 is the current collection efficiency
of the Pt ring.
