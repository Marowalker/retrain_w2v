Many conotoxins, natural peptides
of marine cone snails, have been
identified to target neurons. Here, we provide data on pharmacological
families of the conotoxins of 11 species of cone snails collected
in Bali. The identified definitive pharmacological families possibly
targeting neuronal tissues were α (alpha), ι (iota), κ
(kappa), and ρ (rho). These classes shall target nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors, voltage-gated Na channels, voltage-gated K channels, and
α1-adrenoceptors, respectively. The VI/VII-O3 conotoxins might
be prospected as an inhibitor of N-methyl-d-aspartate. Con-ikot-ikot could be applied as an α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole
propionic acid receptor blocker medicine. The definitive pharmacology
classes of conotoxins as well as those yet to be elucidated need to
be further established and verified.

Introduction
Conotoxins are natural peptide components
of the venoms of marine
cone snails of the Conus genus, which
are remarkably diverse in terms of structure and function.1 Many conotoxins have been identified to have
neuronal targets. The snails capture prey using a diverse array of
toxins, mainly neurotoxins,2 although a
few can be cardioactive.3 Unique potency
and selectivity profiles for a range of neuronal targets have made
several conotoxins valuable as drug leads of analgesics, neuropsychiatric,
and other neuropharmacologicals.1,4,5 Neurologic application for pain reduction is the most common ongoing
approved, preclinical, or clinical trial of conotoxins or their derivates.
The ω-MVIIA conotoxin, marketed as ziconitide, was approved
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2004 to treat chronic
pain.2,6 The χ-MrIA, ω-CVID, contulakin-G,
α-Vc1.1, and μO-MrVIB conotoxins were in preclinical and
clinical trials to cure neuropathic pain or neuroprotection.7−12 Only one conotoxin, namely, κ-PVIIA, was in the preclinical
phase to treat non-neurological complaints. This conotoxin was on
trial to cure myocardial infarction.13

The classical organization of a conopeptide precursor is ER signal
sequence, N-proregion, mature peptide region, and C-terminal proregions.1,14 The precursor protein is then cleaved by proteases, generating active
conotoxins that form key constituents of the venom.15 The conotoxins are classified according to gene superfamily,
cysteine framework, and pharmacological class.14,16,17 The gene superfamily is based on the signal
sequences, the cysteine framework is determined from the number of
cysteine residues with estimated disulfide bonds of the mature peptide,
and the pharmacological class is based on established pharmacological
proof of certain conotoxins.1 The pharmacological
families are annotated with the Greek letters of α (alpha),
γ (gamma), δ (delta), ε (epsilon), ι (iota),
κ (kappa), μ (mu), ρ (rho), σ (sigma), τ
(tau), χ (chi), and ω (omega).18−29 Statistics of gene superfamily, cysteine framework, and pharmacological
family16,17 provide an estimate for the pharmacological
family of newly discovered conotoxins. However, some may occur in
an unknown gene superfamily and cysteine framework. The discovery
of divergent and unassigned gene superfamilies is challenging in the
determination of pharmacological families.

The transcriptomes
of various species of marine cone snails found
in Bali, Indonesia, have been described.30 The evolution and systematic biology points of view of the findings
have been published.30−32 However, the pharmacological actions of discovered
conotoxins have not been reported. Here, we provide data on the pharmacological
families of the species published previously to provide insights into
which to select and further study for bioprospecting potential drug
leads from Indonesian marine snails.

Materials and Methods
Published prosequences of conotoxins from 11 species of snails
found in Bali30 were analyzed. The species
were Conus arenatus, Conus coronatus, Conus ebraeus, Conus imperialis, Conus lividus, Conus marmoreus, Conus quercinus, Conus rattus, Conus sponsalis, Conus varius, and Conus virgo.30 The ER
signal sequence, N-proregion, mature peptide region, and C-terminal
proregions, as well as cysteine framework and gene superfamily, were
identified using ConoServer (http://www.conoserver.org/).1,16,17 The pharmacological families were predicted using
statistics on pharmacological families available on the server based
on previously published cysteine frameworks and gene superfamilies.1 The data were further clustered as definitive
pharmacological family (DPF), definitive combined pharmacological
family (DCPF), nonalphabetical pharmacological family (NAPF), divergent
gene family (DGF), newly proposed gene family,30 novel gene family and cysteine framework combination (NGFCFC),
unassigned gene family (UGF) SF,1 and unknown
conotoxin. The DCPF cluster was further assembled based on the cysteine
framework and gene family. Protein modeling, prediction, and analysis
of the representative mature toxin sequences were conducted using
the Phyre2 server (http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk).33

Results
The pharmacological
classes of conotoxins discovered in various
venomous marine cone snails in Bali, Indonesia, based on pharmacological
family and cysteine framework, are listed in Table 1. Meanwhile, Table 2 shows the detailed list of conotoxin peptides
clustered in DCPF and NAPF identified in various species. The result
shows that the DPFs, listed from the most frequent, were α,
κ, ι, and ρ with 66, 54, 37, and 4 conotoxin sequences,
respectively. The total number of conotoxins annotatable to definitive
families was 161. There were 400, 121, 119, 71, 63, 35, 12, and 3
conotoxins annotated to DCPF as follows, listed in the order of frequency:
δ/γ/κ/μ/ω, α/ι/κ/μ,
ε/μ/τ, γ/ω, α/ρ, α/κ,
α/σ, and α/κ/μ, respectively. A total
of 824 conotoxins were assigned to these clusters. The number of conotoxins
in the clusters of NAPFs of con-ikot-ikot, conkunitzin, conodipin,
conoporin, and conophysin was 101, 58, 30, 28, and 20, respectively.
The other 90 conotoxins were clustered into DGF. NGFCFC consists of
315 sequences. UGFs of SF-04, mi1, and mi2 conotoxins were 50, while
319 were ungrouped conotoxins with certain gene families with poor
cysteine residue. Each cluster was further subclustered based on the
cysteine framework and gene family.

We clustered the mature toxins of the combined families α/ι/κ/μ,
α/κ, α/ρ, α/σ, δ/γ/κ/μ/ω,
ε/μ/τ, and γ/ω and conducted protein
prediction with some representatives of each group. The PDB data for
>50% identity and homology show that only γ/ω representative
resulted in 78.8% homology and 60% identity in the established pharmacological
class. Those with cysteine framework VI/VII and gene superfamily O2
are close to ω-conotoxin MVIIV. The other representatives could
not be estimated in any established pharmacological class (not shown).

The identified DPFs possibly targeting neuronal tissues were α
(alpha), ι (iota), κ (kappa), and ρ (rho), while
those of other groups were the VI/VII-O3 conotoxins as an inhibitor
of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and the con-ikot-ikot
as an α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid
(AMPA) receptor blocker. The representatives of the conotoxins possibly
targeting neuronal tissues found in Bali,Indonesia, are listed in Table 4, which were selected
based on cysteine framework and/or gene superfamily. PDB search of
some conotoxins found no template, which has high percentage of confidence,
while others found template database with confidence levels of 47.5–100%,
with percentages of identity of 38.5–88%. The results of protein
modeling, prediction, and analysis of the representative of mature
toxin sequences are presented in Figure 1. The figure explains that some peptides
consist of random coil and α helix, while LiO32 is merely random

Discussion
As expected, the total number of conotoxins identified in our study
was large or 1996. Such an abundance is very common in marine cone
snails. Each sea snail species typically possesses an average of 100–200
conotoxins,34 which are employed to paralyze
prey.35 Of the total, only 161 (8.1%) can
be assigned to an established pharmacological family. Another 824
(41.3%) are assigned to possible combinations of established families.
The number of conotoxins in the clusters of nonalphabetical families
of con-ikot-ikot, conkunitzin, conodipin, conoporin, and conophysin
was 237 (11.9%). The other 90 conotoxins were clustered into divergent
groups and 71 to new proposed families.

The last group was further
classified as unknown pharmacological
class of conotoxins with definitive gene family and cysteine framework,
nonalphabetical family, divergent, variant MEFR, variant MKFL, variant
MMLFM, variant MRFYM, SF-04, and SF-mi1, as well as SF-mi2 gene families
with definitive or NCFs. NGFCFC consists of 315 sequences. UGFs of
SF-04, mi1, and mi2 conotoxins were 50, while 319 were ungrouped conotoxins
with certain gene families but NCF.

The identified DPFs were
α, κ, ι, and ρ,
while one group is close to ω-conotoxin. Conotoxins assigned
to these families can be explored further as drug leads for neurological
use. Pharmacological families and the pharmacological actions of conotoxins
assigned to them have been identified as stimulating or blocking receptors,
ion channels, or transporters. The α family works at nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs),18 the
ι family at voltage-gated Na channels,22 the κ family at voltage-gated K channels,23 and ρ family at α1-adrenoceptors.26 The ω family is a voltage-gated Ca channel
blocker,29 which might be useful for cardiovascular
disorder.36

To further predict the
pharmacological action of uncertain or unknown
conotoxins, we clustered the data based on gene superfamily and cysteine
framework. The five most common combination of conotoxins with DCPF
was IX—P, followed XV—V, XI—I3, XV—N,
and XXII—E. The combination of IX—P has been described
in TxIXA as a prototype of P-superfamily conotoxin,37 which causes “spasmodic” symptoms on intracerebral
injection in mice. The known O3-gene superfamily conotoxins have the
VI/VII cysteine framework.38 The only characterized
O3 superfamily is “bromosleeper”, which causes lethargy,
drowsiness, and sleep in mice.39 This conotoxin
is thought to be similar to conantokin, an inhibitor of NMDA receptors.1 The pharmacological actions of other combinations
are yet to be described.

Assembling the conotoxins annotated
as belonging to nonalphabetical
gene superfamilies, we listed the combination of gene superfamilies
with an established framework or NCF as conkunitzin combined with
the frameworks IX, XII, XIV, and NCF; con-ikot-ikot with the frameworks
V, XXI, and NCF; and SF-04 and SF-mi1 with the framework XIII. Meanwhile,
SF-mi2, conopidin, conophysin, and conoporin have novel frameworks.
Conkunitzin of conus snails displayed high sequence similarity to
the kunitz domain of dendrotoxin peptides, which are K+ channel blockers found in black mamba venom.40 Conkunitzins in our data are associated with the frameworks
IX, XII, XIV, and NCF. There has been no information published on
the cysteine framework of conkunitzin. Our con-ikot-ikot data show
cysteine frameworks V, XXI, and NCF. The published con-ikot-ikot cysteine
framework is XXI.41−44 The combination with the framework V is also not new.45 Con-ikot-ikot has an effect on AMPA receptors,
inhibiting channel desensitization.43 Conodipine
is a unique conotoxin, originally found in Conus magus, with two polypeptide chains.46 It has
phospholipase-A2 activity like animal venoms, with potent neurotoxicity
to mammalian tissues and bacteria.1 Conophysin
displayed a primary structure and cysteine framework typical of the
neurophysin peptide family.47 The role
of this peptide in venom is not clear. Conophysins and conopressins
are thought of as products of the same peptide precursor. Conopressin,
which is not identified in our dataset, can produce a “scratching
effect” following intracerebral injection in mice.48 Conoporin belongs to conoprotein, the high-molecular-weight
component of Conus spp. venom, which
may be involved in conotoxin maturation.1

We identified peptides that belong to SF-04 and SF-mi1 gene
superfamilies
with the XIII framework. SF-mi1, mi2, and mi3 are temporarily annotated
as undescribed or belonging to superfamilies with the frameworks VI/VII
and XIII.1 Our SF-mi1 sequence data show
framework XIII; however, the SF-mi3 data show an undescribed cysteine
framework. The pharmacological effect of these configurations has
yet to be explored.

We also identified divergent and various
newly proposed superfamilies
combined with various cysteine frameworks. The divergent superfamily
occurs in combination with the frameworks VI/VII and XIV. The various
unassigned superfamilies occur in combination with IX—MEFR,
NCF—MEFR, VI/VII—MKFL, IX—MMLFM, VIII—MMLFM,
XIV—MMLFM, and VI/VII—MRFYM. MEFR, MKFL, MMLFM, and
MRFYM were proposed to be reclassified or assigned as new superfamilies
to “(1) novel groupings of conotoxin gene superfamilies and
(2) groups of conopeptides with similarity to previously characterized
conotoxins but were not given a formal classification” with
a cutoff of 70% signal sequence identity in the established gene superfamilies.30 The pharmacological actions of these conotoxins
are yet to be elucidated.

The number of potential neuronal drugs
from conotoxins discovered
in various venomous marine cone snails in Bali, Indonesia, is huge.
The marine cone snails seem to be well equipped with mainly neurotoxic
venoms, but also a very few cardiotoxic venoms, to immobilize the
prey. A small portion of the conotoxins from Bali could be annotated
to specific pharmacological classifications, which could be the first
stepping stone to develop neurological drugs. A much larger portion
has yet to be assigned, but the pharmacological action can be predicted
based on the published literature. PDB searches of mature toxins with
an undescribed cysteine framework or novel framework pattern combinations
should give an insight into their possible pharmacological actions.

Conotoxins that work on nAChRs might be developed as antidepressants.
nAChR modulation is an area with significant promise for future antidepressant
drug development.49 Furthermore, this group
of cholinergic receptors has been recently known to be involved in
the nicotine reward effect.50 Because ACh
is known as a dopamine release regulator, α-conotoxins may potentially
exhibit a salutary effect in psychoses and Tourette’s syndrome
treatment.51 We assigned 27 peptides from
six species to the α pharmacological class, which acts upon
this receptor. Another 14 peptides are annotated to ι (iota),
with molecular targets of voltage-gated Na channels.22 It is intriguing to discuss the therapeutic potentials
of an ι-conotoxin found in our current study. This conotoxin
has been revealed to possess agonistic activity against three sodium
channels, namely, Nav1.2, Nav1.6, and Nav1.7.52 Because these sodium channels are implicated in many diseases such
as migraine, epilepsy, autism, ataxia, pain disorders, paroxysmal
itch, and anosmia,53 we can utilize this
group as a chemical tool to support the research on developing novel
drugs against these pathological conditions. The ι family could
be developed into drugs targeting chronic pain, epilepsy, and cardiac
arrhythmias.54 The κ targets the
voltage-gated K channels,23 which might
be beneficial to be developed as new drugs for cancer; autoimmune
diseases; and metabolic, neurological, and cardiovascular disorders.55 The ρ class was identified in three peptides
from two species. This class specifically targets the α1-adrenoceptors,26 which play a key role in the modulation of sympathetic
nervous system activity, as well as being a site of action for many
therapeutic agents.56

The NMDA blocker
framework VI/VII—O3 was identified in this
study. This could have the potential to treat some neurodegenerative
disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s
disease, Huntington’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.57,58 Con-ikot-ikot was identified in 10 species (but not C. imperialis), and the number of peptides was 101.
This class is reported to exhibit an effect on AMPA receptors, inhibiting
channel desensitization.43 This can be
a potential antiepileptic drug.59

PDB search of conotoxins shows that the representatives of the
conotoxins possibly targeting neuronal tissues found in this study
are novel. Some have no confidence template in the database, while
others have percentages of identity of 38.5–88%. The variety
of secondary structures of random coil and α helix might explain
the mechanism of action and protein targets.

The pharmacological
effect of the definitive as well as uncertain
pharmacological classes of conotoxins should be determined and proven.
Being peptides, the production and purification of conotoxins should
be straightforward. For example, conotoxins can be produced using
recombinant DNA technology60−62 or synthetic peptides.63−65 Simple clustering based on suspected pharmacological families or
gene families and cysteine framework conducted in our study should
be a simple approach to select conotoxin(s) of interest.

Conclusions
The identified DPFs possibly targeting neuronal tissues were α
(alpha), ι (iota), κ (kappa), and ρ (rho) as well
as NMDA and AMPA receptor blocker. The definitive pharmacology classes
of conotoxins as well as those yet to be elucidated need to be further
established and verified.
