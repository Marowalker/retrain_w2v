Amine-functionalized
thin films are highly desirable technologies
for analytical, material, and biochemistry applications. Current functionalization
procedures can be costly, environmentally unfriendly, and require
many synthetic steps. Here, we present an inexpensive and facile way
to functionalize a silica thin film with a 25 000 MW branched
polyethylenimine (BPEI), consistent with green chemistry principles.
Using UV–vis spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy,
BPEI was determined to be loaded into the film at an approximately
0.5 M concentration, which is a 500× increase from the loading
solution used. The films were also tested for copper(II) sequestration
to assess their potential for heavy metal sequestration and showed
a high loading capacity of 10 ± 6 mmol/g. Films proved to be
reusable, using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid to chelate copper
and regenerate the films, with only a 6% reduction in the amount of
copper(II) ions sequestered by the third use. The films also proved
stable against leaching over the course of 1 week in solution, with
less than 1% of the original BPEI lost under various storage conditions
(i.e., storage in deionized (DI) water, storage in dilute BPEI solution,
storage in DI water after annealing). These films show promise for
multiple applications, from heavy metal sequestration to antifouling
applications, while being inexpensive, facile, and environmentally
friendly to synthesize. To our knowledge, this is the first time that
BPEI has been doped into silica thin films.

Introduction
Surface functionalization
of silica is of great interest in many
different fields, with the ability to change the surface chemistry
of silica particles, monoliths, and thin films, and is a highly desirable
technology. Functionalization can drastically change the behavior
of the silane groups that are typically found on the surface of silica
gels.1−5 Surface functionalization of silica with various amine-containing
compounds has shown increased adsorption of proteins,6 antifouling effects,7 increased
heavy metal adsorption,8 chromatography
applications,9 catalytic applications,10 and more.

One polyamine of great interest
for the functionalization of silica
solid substrates is branched polyethylenimine (BPEI). BPEIs are polymers
of variable molecular weights and rich in primary, secondary, and
tertiary amine groups. They have shown great potential for environmental
applications such as aqueous heavy metal removal11,12 and carbon dioxide capture13 when attached
to a solid substrate. They have also shown antimicrobial activity
both on their own14 and as antibiotic potentiators.15

While BPEI has been loaded into monoliths
and nanoparticles, to
the best of our knowledge, they have never been successfully loaded
into silica thin films, most likely due to their very basic nature
that may significantly impair thin-film formation, as basic conditions
tend to favor nanoparticle formation.16 Thus, there is a distinct possibility that the incorporation of
BPEI may adversely influence the structural integrity of a sol–gel
thin film. Amine-functionalized thin films present expanded application
possibilities, such as anti-biofouling coatings or coatings for heavy
metal remediation.

To this end, many authors have employed multiple
synthetic steps
often with environmentally harmful organic precursors or solvents,17−19 and there is much interest in developing more generic, robust, and
“green” technologies where the reduction in the usage
of harmful solvents is strongly encouraged.20,21 Kinetic doping utilizes aqueous solutions for loading the BPEI guest
molecules into silica thin films, eliminating the need for any organic
solvents relative to other competing surface functionalization technologies.17−19 Using aqueous solutions with low concentrations of BPEI to functionalize
silica thin films, the need for environmentally hazardous solvents
to generate precursors or perform postcoating surface modification
can be effectively eliminated, resulting in a much more green technique.

Silica thin films with amine functionalization can be made with
organosilane precursors that contain an amino-functional group,22 but this limits the size of the amine groups
that can be introduced into the film. Additionally, every new amine
compound requires the synthesis of a new organosilane precursor, adding
another layer of complexity to the functionalization process. Amine-containing
polymers alone can be used to create thin films, but they lack the
benefits of silica, like high surface areas, and many exhibit poor
stability in water.23 Plasma polymerization
can be used to graft amine groups onto existing thin films,24 but the high cost of plasma polymerization is
prohibitive to widespread commercial applications. It is possible
to functionalize silica thin films with polyethylenimine, as certain
synthetic pathways have been demonstrated to functionalize the surface
of silica gels, but they require multiple steps and environmentally
hazardous chemicals.25,26 Here, we present a facile, inexpensive
synthesis of silica sol–gel thin films with doped BPEI that
provides amine functionalization with high loading efficiency using
relatively green chemistry principles.

Doping of BPEI into a
silica sol–gel thin film, instead
of synthetic functionalization of the surface, would allow for a facile,
green synthesis with very few synthetic steps involved. However, polymers
with high molecular mass present a challenge for both the traditional
pre- and postdoping approaches to thin-film loading, as too much polymer
included in predoping, which is a technique that introduces dopants
to the sol before depositing the film on a substrate,27 will likely degrade the structural integrity of the resulting
silica film. Whereas due to poor diffusion, a high-molecular-weight
polymer is never an ideal candidate for postdoping, which involves
adsorbing the dopant to porous surfaces,28 due to poor diffusion. Kinetic doping is a technique for loading
guest molecules into sol–gel thin films that involves introducing
guest molecules into a still-evolving film, allowing them to be entrapped
by the growing silica network.29 This technique
is well suited to overcome the challenges posed by BPEI to the more
widely used doping techniques. Additionally, kinetic doping has previously
been studied with positively charged organic dyes29 and enzymes30 as the dopant
molecule, making BPEI, with its organic nature and high positive charge
density at neutral pH, an ideal candidate for kinetic doping.

Here, we attempt to dope silica sol–gel thin films with
600 and 25 000 MW BPEI. Using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and UV–vis spectroscopy, the quality of the thin films
and the amount of doped BPEI were quantified. The resultant films
are structurally sound with BPEI concentrations in the millimolar
range with minimal leaching of the BPEI observed. Preliminary results
indicate that these films are able to sequester 10 mmol of copper(II)
ions per gram of film from solution, an approximately 5-fold or more
increase over most available amine-functionalized gel technologies.12,25,31−33 Soaking in
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution in a subsequent step
can remove these ions, regenerating the film that can be reused, with
only a 6% decrease in copper(II) ion sequestration efficacy after
three uses. This lends preliminary support for the use of these films
in heavy metal removal with good reusability. It is also, to our knowledge,
the first time that BPEI has been loaded as a guest molecule in silica
sol–gel thin films.

Results and Discussion
Optimal Loading Parameters
for Branched Polyethylenimine (BPEI)
As shown in previous
studies, there are several loading parameters
that need to be examined for optimal kinetic doping. Film thickness
and delay time (the time between the end of drain coating and the
introduction of the film to the loading solution) are important factors
that influence optimal loading. Dopants that do not disrupt film structure
have been shown to have an optimal delay time of 5 min for drain coating.34 This may be different for BPEI, as the extent
of polycondensation of the silica network increases with the delay
time. Due to its basic nature, BPEI may load better into a thin film
that has different levels of condensation than dopants that are relatively
neutral. Drain speed can change the thickness of the film and possibly
the absolute amount of BPEI loaded into the film. The film must be
thick enough to quantify the amount of BPEI loaded, as thicker films
are expected to host more BPEI molecules. Too thick films will lead
to increasing thickness variations across the film, due to the forces
that dominate drain coating in the high-speed regime.35

Two molecular weights of BPEI, a lighter 600 MW and
a heavier 25 000 MW, were tested to determine if identical
loading parameters would work for BPEI with different molecular weights.
They were tested as BPEI of different sizes are known to react differently
with many different chemicals, including silica.36−38

Molecular
Weight
BPEI is a polymer that comes in many
molecular weights. Different molecular weights have different properties;
for example, the cytotoxicity of BPEI increases with increasing molecular
weight.39 Thus, it is desirable to explore
the possibilities to produce silica films with BPEI of different molecular
weights, hence with different cytotoxicities. Consequently, the loadings
of both a low- and a high-molecular-weight, 600 and 25 000
MW, BPEI were attempted. However, none of the parameters that were
tested, including drain speed, delay time, and pH of the loading solution,
could be optimized to allow the kinetic doping of the 600 MW BPEI.
Any attempt to load within the kinetic doping window led to complete
film destruction and visible silica particle aggregates formed in
the solution. It was possible to load the higher molecular weight,
25 000, and loading parameters for that weight were further
refined.

BPEI and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) are known
to form nanoparticles,40 which may act
as an undesirable competing process with the kinetic doping of BPEI
into silica thin films, the speed of which seems to vary with varying
molecular weight. Kinetic doping is thought to work because the polycondensation
of the liquid sol is still progressing during the doping stage and
the dopant can still be entrapped by the evolving and growing silica
network.29 The only films that stayed intact
upon contact with the 600 MW BPEI loading solution appeared to have
passed this window of doping opportunity and did not allow much loading
of the 600 MW BPEI, despite the smaller molecular weight. Different
molecular weights of branched or linear polyethylenimines are known
to react with silicon sources differently;36 so, this difference in behavior is not entirely unprecedented. We
postulate that this is due to the chemical reaction between BPEI and
the TEOS molecules that have not undergone polycondensation. Based
on experimental evidence, 600 MW BPEI is likely to react more quickly
than 25 000 MW BPEI, so quickly that it outcompetes the polycondensation
reaction so that kinetic doping is effectively inhibited.

The
observation that different molecular weights of BPEI react
with the film differently may prove to be a useful way to control
film properties once BPEI of other molecular weights is thoroughly
examined. A thorough investigation of the effect of different BPEI
molecular weights on kinetic doping is currently underway.

Drain
Speed
Film thickness was qualitatively examined
for its effect on the mechanical stability of the film and the amount
of BPEI that remained solvent-accessible. Thicker films, created with
faster drain speeds, take longer to complete the evaporation process
that is responsible for the growth of a three-dimensional (3D) network
through the polycondensation reaction to produce a mature thin film.
Although a thicker film allows more entrapment of BPEI, the slower
evaporation process means more uncondensed TEOS molecules remain to
undergo undesirable side reactions with BPEI. Films that are too thick
will additionally drain-coat in a different regime, leading to increasing
thickness variations on the surface of the film itself.35

Figure 1 shows a series of films that were loaded with a delay
time of 5 min. To vary the film thickness, films were prepared with
drain speeds from 0.67 to 1.50 cm/s; all film coatings were completed
in less than 4 s, regardless of the drain speed. Thinner films (those
coated at a lower drain speed) showed relatively poor loading of BPEI.
As the drain speed increased, the loading became more apparent as
indicated by the more intense blue color on the thin film due to complex
formation with copper(II) ions. It is also apparent that the highly
loaded films exhibited a more significant mechanical deformation at
the corner and edges of the film. A drain speed of 1.36 cm/s was chosen
for further testing as it resulted in a very visible amount of loading
with the least amount of mechanical disruption at the edge.

Figure 1 Films loaded
with a 1 mM BPEI loading solution, a delay time of
5 min, at various drain speeds. (A) Films drained at each different
setting on the pump from 2 to 10. This corresponds to speeds of 0.67,
0.78, 0.87, 0.99, 1.10, 1.17, 1.25, 1.36, 1.41, and 1.50 cm/s, respectively.
Mechanical disruption can be seen most clearly on the corner that
is first in contact with the BPEI loading solution (see Figure 6) and on the edges of the films
nearest that corner. (B) Close-up of the slowest drain speed film,
showing a very faint visible blue color and very little mechanical
disruption. (C) Close-up of the final chosen drain speed (1.36 cm/s),
showing a more intense visible blue color, but at the expense of more
mechanical disruption at the corner and edges.

Delay Time
Delay times in drain coating affect the
extent of polycondensation in the thin film when it is introduced
to the dopant.35 A less evolved silica
network can entrap guest molecules more effectively as more uncondensed
TEOS is available to grow around the dopant. However, that same uncondensed
TEOS can also react with BPEI and prevent the growth of the silica
network into a stable thin film. Indeed, testing of delay times showed
that longer delay times produced more mechanically sound films with
noticeably less pronounced corner and edge deformation, supporting
the notion that BPEI reacts with TEOS in the films that have not completed
condensation. Figure 2A shows the results of loading BPEI with a variety of delay times
from 5:00 to 7:30 min and a 1 mM BPEI loading solution. Figure 2B shows a film with a 5:00
min delay time. There are notable structural defects in the film,
mostly around the corner and edges of the film and especially on the
lower right corner, where a portion of the film was clearly detached
from the glass coverslip and subsequently washed away. Figure 2C shows a film with a delay
time of 7:30 min. Structural defects in the film are less notable
at this longer delay time. Delay times beyond those illustrated in Figure 2 were also tested
(8:00, 8:30, and 9:00 min can be found in the Supporting Information), but they progressively produced less
loading, despite showing improved mechanical stability over the 7:30
min delay film. This seems to indicate that the kinetic doping window
is closing, as very little uncondensed TEOS remains to effectively
entrap the BPEI. On the other hand, the more condensed silica network
in the longer delay time films seems to better resist the mechanical
disruption caused by BPEI, due to the very same lack of uncondensed
TEOS.

Figure 2 Films loaded with a 1 mM BPEI loading solution, at a 1.36 cm/s
drain speed, with varying delay time, in triplicate. (A) Delay times
ranging from 5 min (top row) to 7 min and 30 s (bottom row), in 30
s increments. (B) Close-up of one of the 5 min delay time films, showing
the large mechanical defects caused by the early introduction of BPEI,
especially on the lower right corner. Part of the film at the lower
right-hand corner was obviously removed during the washing step, as
it had detached from the substrate. (C) Close-up of one of the 7 min
30 s films, showing a much less mechanical disruption than the shorter
delay time periods but with a slightly lower loading capacity as indicated
by the fainter blue color.

Thicker films and shorter delay times seem to favor the competing
process of nanoparticle formation with TEOS molecules that have not
completed condensation, resulting in more severe mechanical defects.
This is further supported by the results with the 600 MW BPEI, where
silica particle formation outcompeted kinetic doping at all delay
times we examined. Thinner films and longer delay times allow the
film to reach a higher level of condensation and develop sufficient
mechanical strength whereupon, when it is introduced into the basic
BPEI, it has built sufficient scaffolding to stay structurally sound
on the macroscopic level, unfortunately at the expense of BPEI loading.

Quantification of Doped BPEI in Thin Films
The molarity
of the doped BPEI was examined using a method based on Wen et al.41 A standard curve was constructed using a varying
amount of BPEI to complex with a constant 1 mM copper(II) solution.
This standard curve showed high linearity and an extinction coefficient
of 429 mM–1 cm–1 (see the Supporting Information). The dopant solution
for the thin films, diluted to the linear range of the 276 nm standard
curve, was then combined with copper(II) chloride to quantify the
concentration of the remaining BPEI. The difference between the concentration
of the solution prior to loading (preloading) and after loading was
taken as the amount of BPEI loaded. Figure 3 shows the absorption spectra of six replicates
and the preloading solution. The average number of moles of BPEI loaded
for films with a 7:30 min delay time, a 1.36 cm/s drain speed, and
a 1 mM dopant solution was 0.7 ± 0.2 μmol. To then calculate
the concentration of BPEI in the films, the thickness of the film
was measured via SEM.

Figure 3 Absorption spectra of BPEI loading solutions with 1 mM
copper(II)
chloride. The labeled “preloading” is an aliquot of
the 1 mM BPEI loading solution that was set aside without interaction
with films. Films 1–6 are loading solutions from individual
films, where the film was removed after 1 week of loading and the
solution left was tested for BPEI concentration.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained via a JEOL
JSM-880 instrument with a 5 nm Au–Pd sputter-coated layer to
examine the morphology of the drain-coated thin film and measure the
film thickness. Thirteen separate films were examined, 6 with 1 mM
dopant solutions and 7 without any loaded BPEI. It was observed that
the thickness of the film was highly variable over a single film.
Films with BPEI had a wider range of thickness from as low as 53 nm
up to 1.93 μm on one film, as can be seen in Figure 4. This seems to partly be a
result of the drain coating setup, as a slightly lower variance was
seen in the unloaded films, with thicknesses ranging from 1 to 1.79
μm in a single film. The angle of loading in both drain and
dip coating is known to affect the thickness and shape of the resultant
film, which is not a perfect 90° in our drain coating apparatus.
An angle other than a perfect 90° between the substrate and the
surface of the liquid sol results in a film with a wedge-shaped, linearly
changing thickness across the direction of coating42 and could explain some of the variances seen. Additionally,
drain coating at high drain speeds, like those used for our films,
can result in varying thickness across a single film,35 also contributing to the shape seen in the SEM images.
A diagram of the drain coating setup is depicted in Figure 5, with the loading angle of
the film labeled. The variance across the film in both the loaded
and unloaded films suggests that both the angle and drain speed contribute
to the thickness variation. While a commercial dip coating setup may
enable a perfect 90° angle of loading, the drain speed would
have to be lowered drastically to enter the coating regime that might
produce a film with even thickness. The resultant film would be too
thin for our desired high-capacity BPEI loading.

a single thin film loaded with BPEI. (A)
Image from the edge of the film. The film is only ∼50 nm thick.
The inset is an enlarged portion of the interface between the glass
substrate and film. (B) Image from the same film. This is the middle
of the cross section, where the film is ∼1.9 μm thick.

Figure 5 Diagram of the laboratory drain coating setup with a magnified
side-view inset. The glass substrate is suspended above the sol using
a wire with two alligator clips at either end. This can lead to an
angle of loading (the angle labeled in the side-view inset) deviated
from a perfect 90°. While this change may not drastically affect
the thickness of extremely thin films, it does have a large effect
on the micrometer thickness films presented here. This diagram also
demonstrates which edge of the film comes into contact with BPEI first,
where most of the mechanical disruption to the film can be seen.

However, it is important to note that the variance
across films
loaded with BPEI was consistently much greater. This is most likely
due to the interaction of BPEI with the film. The SEM images seem
to suggest that the interaction with BPEI causes the edges of the
film to thin, but most of the middle portion stays intact. The edges
of the film are where BPEI first comes into contact with it (see Figure 5). PEI is known to
etch silica nanoparticles;43 so, this may
be a similar phenomenon at the edges. This potential etching does
not extend to the majority of the film, which remains at the same
thickness as the unloaded films. However, given this variance in thickness,
only an approximation of the final molarity of the film can be made.
If we use an average thickness of 1 μm across the film, the
average molarity of the loaded BPEI would be ∼0.5 M, an approximately
500× increase over the loading solution; 0.5 M is in line with
concentrations previously reported with kinetic doping, but is a lower
percent increase over the loading solution than achieved with proteins
or rhodamine 6G (R6G) dye.29,30 This is most likely
due to the competing reactions of silica/BPEI particle formation and
kinetic doping. The dyes and proteins do not have any competing reactions,
meaning all molecules that enter the film should stay there, in their
original state, unlike BPEI. In addition, R6G is capable of hydrogen
bonding with small pores inside the silica network to further enhance
its loading relative to that of BPEI. Nevertheless, the increase in
the molarity of the film over the loading solution still means that
the very dilute solutions of BPEI can be used to make more concentrated
films, reducing the need for larger amounts of BPEI, the most expensive
chemical used for producing these films.

Additionally, the SEM
images were compared to identify any morphology
differences between the BPEI loaded and unloaded films. Figure 6 shows a cross-sectional and top-down image of a loaded film,
while Figure 7 shows
the same for an unloaded film. The morphology does not seem to change
drastically in the cross-sectional images between the loaded and unloaded
films, but the grain size seems to be slightly larger in the loaded
versus the unloaded films. The top-down view does show noticeable
differences: the film surface in Figure 6C appears to be much smoother and devoid
of major dents relative to that shown in Figure 7C, suggesting that BPEI does alter the surface
morphology of the films to a certain degree. The surface of the film
in Figure 7C, the unloaded
film, has both small and large “dimples”, with an orange
peel effect texture on the surface. Figure 6C, the loaded film, does not show this texture,
and the bright spots are only glass fragments. The samples must be
cut down to fit in the SEM instrument, causing some glass fragments
to appear in the sample images due to the glass coverslip the films
are coated on.

image
of a loaded film at a 25× magnification. (B) Inset of the same
image with a 100× magnification. (C) Top-down image of a loaded
film at a 25× magnification. The bright white spots seen are
glass fragments caused by the sample preparation for use with the
SEM instrument.

an unloaded film at a 25× magnification. (B) Inset of the same
image with a 100× magnification. (C) Top-down image of an unloaded
film at a 25× magnification. The texture seen on the film includes
both the large and smaller dimples and the more general orange peel
texture of the film.

Figure 8 also compares
an unloaded film to a loaded film, showing dark patches or a “mottled”
effect on the SEM image of the loaded film that is most likely due
to the presence of BPEI. This mottled effect occurs on all BPEI loaded
samples, but none of the unloaded samples, suggesting that it is due
to the interaction of BPEI with the electron beam. It is unlikely
to be simply organic contamination, as it does not show the characteristic
dark square that is the hallmark of hydrocarbon contamination.44 If these darker patches on the SEM images are
indeed caused by BPEI, this suggests that the BPEI is distributed
fairly evenly throughout the entire thin film, not just localized
on the surface. Elemental analysis through energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy was attempted to confirm this, but the signal from the
glass coverslip substrate was so dominant that no discernible signal
was observed for the thin films for a meaningful determination of
elemental composition.

Figure 8 Cross-sectional images of an unloaded (A) and loaded (B)
film,
both at a 25× magnification. There is a distinct mottling pattern
that can be seen in the loaded films, but was never observed in the
unloaded films. It does not have the characteristic square pattern
of hydrocarbon contamination. It is most likely due to the BPEI itself,
which seems to be distributed throughout the film.

Stability of BPEI in Doped Films
BPEI-doped films were
tested for leaking over the course of 1 week. Films can be stored
dry with no degradation and show no leaking when tested in a copper(II)
solution for up to 2 h, but more advanced applications, like heavy
metal remediation or anti-biofouling coatings, may require films to
be submerged or stored wet for an extended period of time. To test
the leaking of BPEI, films were (i) untreated and stored in deionized
(DI) water, (ii) annealed at 100 °C for approximately 18 h and
stored in DI water, or (iii) untreated and stored in a 0.01 mM BPEI
solution. Untreated films in DI water were expected to release the
most BPEI, while untreated films in a dilute BPEI solution were expected
to release less BPEI due to the reduced concentration difference between
the film and the storage solution. Annealed films were also expected
to release less BPEI due to morphological changes induced by the annealing
process. Annealing is expected to cause silica pore collapse, making
it more difficult for BPEI to leave or leach from the film. The results
of this study are summarized in Table 1. Over the course of 1 week, the untreated films stored
in DI water show the most loss, with a 0.6% loss of BPEI. Storing
the films in a 0.01 mM BPEI solution, even without treatment, decreases
this loss to 0.4%. Annealing the film further reduces this loss, even
when stored in DI water, to 0.1%. Collectively speaking, these results
suggest that BPEI-doped films could be used for an extended period
of time in solution.

Copper(II) Uptake and Reusability
Copper(II) ion uptake
by the films was tested to obtain preliminary data on the suitability
of this technology for heavy metal remediation. On average, films
were able to sequester 10 (±6) mmol of copper ions per gram of
film. In comparison, the best commercial resin documented so far for
copper(II) uptake is 2.06 mmol/g.31 Our
thin film also outperforms newer, more expensive ion imprinting technology,
made with an amino-functionalized silane precursor, with our copper(II)
loading capacity an order of magnitude higher than that reported (39.82
mg/g or ∼0.6 mmol/g) and with comparable regeneration capabilities.12,45 The film also outperforms several other technologies that use (B)PEI;
a PEI/silk fibroin hydrogel has a copper(II) uptake of 163.9 mg/g
(∼2.6 mmol/g),46 silica-bound BPEI
has a copper(II) capacity of less than 5 mmol/g,32 and even a PEI-functionalized ion-imprinted hydrogel had
a similar uptake to the other hydrogels cited (40.00 mg/g or ∼0.6
mmol/g).12

This enhanced uptake per
mass makes sense, as the resin or bulk materials are likely only able
to sequester ions on the surface, whereas most of its bulk remains
inaccessible to metal ions. According to our SEM data, BPEI is likely
loaded throughout the film, and much of it is expected to be accessible
to the copper(II) ions, due to the highly porous nature of silica
versus the other polymers that have been used, making it highly efficient
at sequestering metal ions from solution. Additionally, the concentration
of BPEI loaded into the film is approximately 0.5 M, which is a higher
concentration than other methods are able to achieve, which means
that there are more amine groups present in our film to interact with
the copper(II) ions. The only material with a similar loading capacity
reported in the literature is the copper(II) adsorption capacity of
silica shell microspheres with magnetic cores, a material that is
much more expensive and produced via a much more involved synthesis.47

Reusability of the films was also examined,
as regeneration of
the metal adsorption capacity is highly desirable in heavy metal remediation
technology. By the third use of the film, the adsorption capacity
of the films had only decreased by 6%. However, it was observed that
copper(II) sequestration efficiency of the film reduced nonlinearly,
and by the fourth use, adsorption capacity had decreased by 20%, to
8 (±5) mmol/g. Despite the dramatic decrease, this is still a
much higher capacity for copper(II) sequestration than most amine-functionalized
gels.

Conclusions
Using kinetic doping, we were able to produce
an amine-rich thin
film by loading BPEI into silica thin films at an approximately 0.5
M concentration, a 500× increase from the loading solution, without
any need for predoping precursor synthetic chemistry or postdoping
surface modification reactions. This is a facile, green, and inexpensive
procedure for introducing amines to silica thin films. To our knowledge,
this is the first time BPEI has been doped into silica thin films.

Additionally, these films were preliminarily shown to sequester
copper(II) ions at 10 mmol/g, much higher capacity than most technology
found in the literature. They also proved to be fairly reusable, with
only a 6% decrease in efficacy after three uses, and were stable in
solution over the course of a week with less than 1% loss of BPEI
from the film. BPEI loaded films are a promising technology that could
sequester heavy metal ions from solution, accomplished by more efficient,
less expensive, and “greener” practices.

Thin
films loaded with BPEI present untapped possibilities for
a wide range of applications. This is made possible via kinetic doping
to load guest molecules into silica thin films, which has been considered
one of the major challenges for more advanced thin-film technology.
SEM images suggest that loaded BPEI is distributed throughout the
entire 3D silica network inside a film. Due to its ability to sequester
copper(II) ions, this presents an intriguing possibility of the construction
of transparent and conductive films if the copper(II) can be reduced
to metallic copper. Additionally, BPEI in solution has shown antibacterial
properties,39 making BPEI-doped silica
thin films a potential platform to develop surface coatings for medical
implants to suppress bacterial infection.

Methods
Materials and
General Methods
Tetraethylorthosilicate
(TEOS) and 600 and 2500 MW branched polyethylenimines (BPEIs) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The 600 MW BPEI has a primary/secondary/tertiary
amine ratio of 1:2:1, respectively, and the 25 000 MW BPEI
has a ratio of 1:1.2:0.76. Phosphoric acid was purchased from EMD
Millipore. Premium-grade glass coverslips (25 mm × 25 mm ×
170 μm) were purchased from Fisher Scientific. All chemicals
and materials were used as received, with the exception of the glass
coverslips, which were cleaned prior to use. All UV–vis spectra
were obtained via a Shimadzu UV-2101PC UV–vis spectrometer.

Preparation of Glass Coverslips
To remove any organic
contaminants on the glass coverslip surface, the coverslips were sonicated
in an acetone bath for 30 min and rinsed with Millipore water three
times to remove all residual acetone. The coverslips were then sonicated
in 10% w/v NaOH for another 30 min and rinsed with Millipore water
five times to remove all residual NaOH. The coverslips then went through
a final sonication in Millipore water for 30 min. The coverslips were
then stored in Millipore water until use.

Preparation of Silica Sol
Silica sol was prepared by
mixing a 1:8:7 molar ratio of TEOS/ethanol/water, respectively, with
phosphoric acid acting as a catalyst. A mixture of 55.9 mL of TEOS,
111.8 mL of ethanol, 31.7 mL of deionized water, and 0.62 mL of 1%
v/v phosphoric acid at room temperature was prepared for most coatings.
The sol was then allowed to age for 20 h undisturbed at room temperature
before use.

Preparation of BPEI-Doped Silica Sol–Gel
Thin Films
Thin films were prepared by drain-coating with
a sol solution inside
a beaker, based on the drain-coated film preparation method of Crosley
et al.34 After aging for 20 h, the silica
sol solution was transferred to a 250 mL beaker, elevated by a jack
stand. A clean coverslip was dried with compressed air and immersed
in the aged silica sol–gel coating solution while suspended
from above. The sol solution was then drained at a rate of 1.36 cm/s;
the entire drain coating is completed in less than 2 s. Immediately
after the silica sol solution was drained, the jack stand was lowered
until the newly coated coverslip was completely exposed to ambient
air. The thin film was allowed to age in ambient air for 7.5 min before
it was transferred to a loading solution, where BPEI was allowed to
load into the film via kinetic doping for 1 week. The loading solution
consisted of a 1 mM 25 000 MW BPEI in 10 mM phosphate buffer,
adjusted to pH 7.4 with phosphoric acid.

Quantitative Determination
of BPEI Loading
Detection
of BPEI in the film was done qualitatively with a procedure based
on the method for copper detection with BPEI by Wen et al.41 using the sequestration of copper(II) by BPEI.
This produced a dark blue color that could be seen in the film with
the naked eye. Quantification of BPEI loading was measured separately,
based on the same interaction with copper(II) ions.

The basic
amine functional groups in BPEI reacted visibly with the sol–gel
film as the film was lowered into the BPEI loading solution, often
resulting in a slightly opaque film. The effect is especially prominent
around the corner and edges of the films. Due to the degradation in
film transparency, the depletion of BPEI from the loading solution
was used to quantify the amount of BPEI loaded. Films were removed
from the loading solution after 1 week of loading time, and the loading
solution was saved for testing. Excess loading solution, stored under
the same conditions without exposure to any film, was also saved as
a reference for testing.

The concentration of BPEI in the dopant
solution, both with and
without exposure to thin films, was then determined spectroscopically
by complex formation with a known quantity of copper(II); the resulting
complex exhibited two peaks, one intense peak in the UV region (276
nm) and one weaker peak in the visible region (638 nm). The UV peak
was chosen for the determination of BPEI loading, as the peak at 638
nm was too weak to quantify the small depletion of BPEI in the loading
solution. The solutions could be minimally diluted such that the absorbance
would fall in the linear range of the peak at 276 nm. The difference
in copper(II) concentration for the solutions that had been used to
load films and the solution that had not was used to calculate the
number of moles of BPEI loaded into the film. A control experiment
was performed by placing a clean glass coverslip into the dopant solution
for 1 week, and the same difference method was used to show that BPEI
was depleted noticeably from the loading solution only in the presence
of a silica sol–gel thin film.

Quantitative Determination
of Copper(II) Sequestration and Reusability
Sequestration
of copper(II) ions was also measured based on the
method of Wen et al.41 A concentration
curve was made with varying amounts of copper(II) chloride and constant
1 mM BPEI at 638 nm. The peak at 638 nm proved more suitable than
the 276 nm peak in this measurement due to the relatively high concentration
of copper ions, as it showed linearity in the concentration range
being tested. Five identically prepared BPEI loaded films were placed
into a solution of 20 mM copper(II) chloride and allowed to equilibrate
for 30 min. The five BPEI loaded silica films were then removed from
the copper(II) solution, and the concentration of copper(II) remaining
in the solution was measured at 638 nm after the addition of 1 mM
BPEI. This was compared to the original 20 mM copper(II) chloride
solution, and the decrease in copper(II) ion concentration was calculated.
An average mass for the films, obtained from 15 samples, was then
used to calculate the amount of copper(II) sequestered per gram of
film.

To examine the reusability, the five films that had been
tested for copper(II) sequestration were then put into a 10 mM EDTA
solution for 30 min. The films were rinsed, dried, and put back into
a fresh 20 mM copper(II) chloride solution. The films were again allowed
to equilibrate for 30 min; the concentration of copper(II) remaining
in the solution was measured again to assess the copper(II) sequestration
efficiency of the films. This cycle was repeated until a significant
decrease in copper(II) sequestration was observed.
