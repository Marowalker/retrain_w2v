Knowledge-based design
of extracting agents for selective binding
of actinides is essential in stock-pile stewardship, environmental
remediation, separations, and nuclear fuel disposal. Robust computational
protocols are critical for in depth understanding of structural properties
and to further advance the design of selective ligands. In particular,
rapid radiochemical separations require predictive capabilities for
binding in the gas phase. This study focuses on gas-phase binding
preferences of cyclic imide dioximes to uranyl, neptunyl, plutonyl,
and americyl. Structural properties, electron withdrawing effects,
and their effects on binding preferences are studied with natural
bond-order population analysis. The aromatic amidoximes are found
to have a larger electron-donation effect than the aliphatic amidoximes.
It is also found that plutonyl is more electron withdrawing than uranyl,
neptunyl, and americyl when bound to the cyclic imide dioximes studied.

Introduction
All of the actinides
are radioactive, with a broad range of half-lives.
Selective ligand binding for separation of U, Np, Pu, and Am is critical
in various applications for nuclear fuel disposal, reprocessing and
stock-pile stewardship, and in environmental remediation.1−3 In particular, optimization of separations in nuclear fuel disposal
and remediation is essential due to the large amount of radioactive
material that is generated including rare earth elements, actinides,
and light fission fragments.4−6 Industrial scale separations largely
focus on utilizing the PUREX process to separate Pu from a mixture
of U, Np, Am, and rare earth fission fragments.7 Although this process is efficient, it produces mixed organic
radioactive waste as a product. Furthermore, PUREX is inherently not
proliferation resistant, which makes the process less ideal for countries
seeking to process their own fuels. Better understanding of extracting
agents’ selectivity is needed for improved proliferation resistant
fuel cycles. Moreover, selective binding to the uranyl cation for
sequestering U from seawater as a possible source of uranium for power
production has been heavily investigated, with emphasis on dioximes
as extracting agents.8−12 These efforts continue to be explored as a possible synergistic
operation with desalinization plants or by direct seawater “mining”
with subsequent recovery of U.

Although traditional solvent
extraction and ion-exchange techniques
have been largely used for separations of lanthanides and actinides,
gas-phase studies are critical for rapid radiochemical separations13−19 and efficient capabilities for the prediction of binding selectivity
in the gas phase are essential to optimize and design separation agents.
Calculations of differences in Gibbs free energy of reaction allow
for the prediction of likelihood of binding selectivity and further
possible separation selectivity, however, fundamental understanding
of complexation preferences from structural characteristics and electron-withdrawing
effects can be insightful for the design of targeted extracting agents.
In particular, understanding binding preferences from electron-withdrawing
effects and further structural changes can be essential to optimize
rapid separations in the gas phase. Developing new protocols or improving
current methodologies is critical to accelerate the optimization of
separations of actinides. Computational knowledge-based design of
separation agents for selective binding of actinides is particularly
appealing due to its ability to screen various ligands for separation
efficiency while reducing experimental trial and error, which is a
limiting factor when working with radioactive elements.

Binding
agents for uranium extraction have been extensively studied
by Rao, Hay, and others.8,9,20−31 Previous studies have also investigated uranyl bound to cyclic imide
dioximes, including computational predictions aiding experimental
findings.9,20,24,26,31−35 Although there have been many studies in this area, the methods
of choice have varied greatly among studies.

This study provides
a systematic computational analysis focusing
on the correlation between electron withdrawing effects predicted
with natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis, structural characteristics,
and possible implications in binding strength of uranyl, neptunyl,
plutonyl, and americyl complexed with chelating amidoxime ligands
[AnO2(HA)(NO3)(CH3OH) (Figure 1a), AnO2(HB)(NO3)(CH3OH) (Figure 1b), AnO2(HC)(NO3)(CH3OH) (Figure 1c), AnO2(HA)2 (Figure 1d), AnO2(HB)2 (Figure 1e), and AnO2(HC)2 (Figure 1f),
with H2A = acenaphtho[1,2-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole
8,8-dioxide (Np-CAO-H2)U(O)2(NO3)(CH3OH), H2B = phthalimidedioxime, H2C =
glutarimidedioxime, and An = U, Np, Pu, and Am.] The proposed compounds
contain cyclic imide dioximes with the same backbone differing in
the number and aromaticity character of the rings. Population analyses
are calculated with NBO, as it was shown that the NBO population analyses
of [An(NO3)]2+ structures were largely independent
of the level of theory of choice.36 The
same study indicated that Mulliken and Lowdin population analyses
for the [An(NO3)]2+ compounds across the entire
actinide series showed a large dependence on the level of theory of
choice.36 The focus of this work is to
provide relative characteristics among the compounds studied addressing
structural properties and electron-withdrawing effects. The associated
Gibbs free energies of reaction obtained with density functional theory
(DFT) are reported as reference only, as other considerations, including
multireference and spin–orbit relativity, would need to be
addressed for accurate energetic predictions. A T1/D1 diagnostic in a study of [An(NO3)]2+ structures36 predict the T1 coefficients to be 0.023 for [U(NO3)]2+, 0.024 for [Np(NO3)]2+ and [Am(NO3)]2+, and 0.025 for [Pu(NO3)]2+, with D1 coefficients of 0.067 for [U(NO3)]2+ and [Np(NO3)]2+, 0.074 for
[Pu(NO3)]2+, and 0.065 for [Am(NO3)]2+. However, no set limits have been established for T1/D1 diagnostics thresholds to establish
multireference character of actinide compounds. UO2(HA)(NO3)(CH3OH) was synthesized by Jenkins and co-workers,37 UO2(HB)2, UO2(HC)2, and NpO2(HC)2a complexes were studied by Rao and co-workers.8,24,38

and appropriately normed semilocal (SCAN) functional are included
in the Supporting Information (SI).

Population
Analysis
The partial charges predicted with
NBO for the fragments in the compounds studied indicate plutonyl is
more electron withdrawing than neptunyl, followed by americyl, and
uranyl in the compounds studied (shown in Figure 2 and Table S.4 in the SI). Consequently, a larger electron donation from the ligand
(for HX = HA, HB, and HC) backbone is observed for plutonyl than neptunyl
and americyl, followed by uranyl, for all compounds proposed in this
study. A higher electron donation is observed in the ligand backbone
in AnO2(HX)2 compounds than in the AnO2(HX)(NO3)(CH3OH) counterpart (within 0.06 units).
Additionally, the backbone from the HA ligand is more electron donating
than in HB, which is also more electron donating than HC for the AnO2(HX)(NO3)(CH3OH) and AnO2(HX)2 compounds.

The NO3– segment reveals a slightly lower electron donation in the uranyl
compounds than the corresponding neptunyl, plutonyl, and americyl
compounds, and it is found to be less electron donating than HX– in all AnO2(HX)(NO3)(CH3OH) compounds. Electronic density for the CH3OH
segment seems independent of the HX character of the ligand. NBO populations
calculated for the CH3OH segment show no significant difference
in electron-withdrawing effects among the compounds studied. Figure 2 shows calculated
NBO partial charges for AnO22+, backbone (O3–N1–C1–N2–C2–N3–O4),b NO3–, and CH3OH segments in all compounds. Identifying labels for atoms in the
compounds studied are shown in Figure 3. All NBO values
are included in Table S.4 in the Supporting
Information (SI).

The natural electron configuration in the compounds studied
reveals
a 5f occupancy between 2.60 and 2.64 for U, between 3.84 and 3.88
for Np, between 4.96 and 5.01 for Pu, and between 6.09 and 6.12 for
Am. The natural charge observed in the proposed compounds for U is
between 1.60 and 1.67, between 1.35 and 1.41 for Np, between 1.19
and 1.26 for Pu, and 1.16 and 1.22 for Am. The natural 7s, 5f, 6d,
and 7p electron configurations as well as the An charge for U, Np,
Pu, and Am in AnO2(HX)(NO3)(CH3OH)
and AnO2(HX)2 compounds are shown in Table 1.

Structural Analysis
This study focuses on differences
observed among the proposed complexes. For validation purposes, the
differences between bond lengths reported for known crystal structures
of UO2(HA)(NO3)(CH3OH)37 and UO2(HC)28 are calculated.

Table 2 shows differences between bond lengths obtained with X-ray
crystallography and with computational predictions for U–O1,
U–O3, U–O4, U–N2, and N3–O4 in UO2(HA)(NO3)(CH3OH) and UO2(HC)2. The U–O1 bond length in UO2(HA)(NO3)(CH3OH) is observed to be 0.004 Å shorter
than in UO2(HC)2, and computational results
predict this difference to be 0.006 Å. Similarly, the U–N2
bond length is observed to be 0.049 Å shorter in UO2(HA)(NO3)(CH3OH) than in UO2(HC)2, with a computational prediction of 0.041 Å. All bond
lengths and differences obtained from crystal structures and computational
predictions are reported in Table S.5 in
the SI.

The An–O distance in the
actinyl group is the same between
An–O1 and An–O2 in all of the AnO2(HX)2 compounds. Differences between the An–O1 and An–O2
bond lengths in the AnO2(HX)(NO3)(CH3OH) compounds are within 0.001 and 0.005 Å. The An–O1
bond length is found to be longest for uranyl compounds, followed
by neptunyl compounds, plutonyl compounds, and shortest in americyl
compounds. On average, among the compounds tested, the U–O1
bond is 0.022 Å longer than Np–O1, 0.032 Å longer
than Pu–O1, and 0.039 Å longer than Am–O1. The
An–O bond length is longer in the AnO2(HX)2 configuration than in AnO2(HX)(NO3)(CH3OH). Differences between An–O1 among the compounds
tested are shown in Tables 3 and 5.

The An–N2 distance amongst the compounds studied
is between
2.660 and 2.432 Å. The An–N2 bond length is between 2.660
and 2.482, 2.650 and 2.455, 2.635 and 2.445, and 2.621 and 2.432 Å
for An = U, Np, Pu, and Am, respectively. Americyl compounds with
the HB ligand present the shortest An–N2 bond length among
the AmO2(HX)(NO3)(CH3OH) and AnO2(HX)2 compounds, with lengths of 2.432 and 2.448
Å, respectively. Similarly, the longest An–N2 bond length
is observed for uranyl with the HA ligand, in both the UO2(HA)(NO3)(CH3OH) and UO2(HA)2 configurations, with 2.616 and 2.660 Å bond lengths,
respectively. The An–N2 bond length for the AnO2(HA)2 and AnO2(HC)2 compounds is
found to be between 2.660 and 2.621 Å, whereas this length for
the AnO2(HA)(NO3)(CH3OH) and AnO2(HC)(NO3)(CH3OH) compounds is between
2.616 and 2.563 Å. A noticeable decrease of 0.075 Å in the
An–N2 bond length is observed for the HB compounds, with respect
to the HA and HC compounds. The An–N2 bond length for AnO2(HB)(NO3)(CH3OH) and AnO2(HB)2 is between 2.488 and 2.432 Å. Figure 4 shows the An–N2 bond
length for all compounds. Overall, as shown in Figure 5, the U–N2 bond length is longer than
Np–N2, which is longer than the Pu–N2, with the Am–N2
bond length being the shortest amongst the compounds studied [i.e.,
AnO2(HX)(NO3)(CH3OH) and AnO2(HX)2, with HX = HA, HB, and HC.]

O3–An–O4, An–O3–N1,
and An–O4–N3 angles in AnO2(HX)(NO3)(CH3OH), AnO2(HX)2, with An = U,
Np, Pu, and Am and HX = HA, HB, and HC.

angle in AnO2(HX)(NO3)(CH3OH), AnO2(HX)2, with An = U, Np, Pu, and Am and HX = HA,
HB, and HC.

As the An–N2 bond
length decreases, the O3–An–O4
angle increases and the An–O3–N1 and An–O4–N3
angles decrease. Furthermore, the O3–An–O4 angle is
predicted to be smallest for U compounds and largest for Am compounds.
The An–O3–N1 angle is predicted to be largest for U
compounds and smallest for Am compounds. It is important to notice
that even though the An–N2 bond length decreases as the O3–An–O4
angle increases, a distinct break is observed between the compound
with HA and HC ligands versus those with the HB ligand. Figures 4 and 5 show the predicted trends.

On average, the interatomic distances
in the backbone (O3–N1–C1–N2–C2–N3–O4)
are 1.328 Å for all compounds tested (with 1.309 and 1.352 Å
being the shortest and longest distance, respectively). The H2A, H2B, and H2C compounds not bound
to AnO22+ show average bond lengths of 1.418,
1.286, 1.384, 1.384, 1.286, and 1.418 Å for O3–N1, N1–C1,
C1–N2, N2–C2, C2–N3, and N3–O4, respectively.
Calculated bond lengths in the backbone are shown in Table S.6 in the SI. This bond length distribution of approximately
1.3 Å along the backbone of the HX ligands bound to AnO22+ while being a 1.4/1.2 Å in the unbound ligands
is consistent to findings presented by Bernstein et al. for UO2(HA)(NO3)(CH3OH)c37 and Tian et al. for UO2(HC)2,d8 which
suggests an O–N–C–N–C–N–O
configuration advantageous for an electronic delocalization likely
contributing to strong coordination to AnO22+.

Gibbs Free Energies of Reaction
The proposed compounds
[AnO2(HX)(NO3)(CH3OH) and AnO2(HX)2 with An = U, Np, Pu, and Am and HX = HA,
HB, and HC] are found to be most stable with plutonyl and least stable
with americyl. As shown in Figure 6, all configurations studied present a lower Gibbs
free energy of reaction for the complexation of plutonyl than for
uranyl, neptunyl, and americyl for the reactions indicated in eqs 1a, 1b and 2a, 2b, with An(VI).

to eqs 1a, 1b and 2a, 2b for
AnO2(HX)(NO3)(CH3OH) and AnO2(HX)2, with An = U, Np, Pu, Am and HX = HA, HB,
and HC. Results are relative to AmO2(HB)(NO3)(CH3OH) and shown in kcal mol–1. The
continuous lines are shown as a visual aid and do not represent an
interpolation. Y-axis oriented with increasing stability.

The Gibbs free energy of reaction
for the plutonyl compounds is
between 8.07 and 4.60 kcal mol–1 lower than for
the corresponding uranyl compounds. Similarly, the neptunyl compounds
show a difference in Gibbs free energy of reaction between 10.41 and
7.52 kcal mol–1 lower than for the corresponding
americyl compounds. A smaller difference is observed between uranyl
and neptunyl compounds, where the uranyl compounds present a Gibbs
free energy of reaction between 2.40 and 0.21 kcal mol–1 lower than the corresponding neptunyl compounds. Differences in
Gibbs free energy of reaction for all compounds are included in Table S.7 in the SI.

Overall, the AnO2(HX)2 compounds have a lower
Gibbs free energy of reaction than their respective AnO2(HX)(NO3)(CH3OH) compounds (for HX = HA, HB,
and HC). The UO2(HX)2 compounds present Gibbs
free energies of 23.05, 13.94, and 30.17 kcal mol–1 lower than the equivalent UO2(HX)(NO3)(CH3OH) compounds, for HA, HB, HC, respectively. Similarly, the
NpO2(HX)2 compounds present Gibbs free energies
of 21.18, 12.93, and 29.19 kcal mol–1 lower than
the equivalent NpO2(HX)(NO3)(CH3OH)
compounds, with HX = HA, HB, and HC, respectively. The PuO2(HX)2 compounds show Gibbs free energies of 22.23, 11.55,
and 29.05 kcal mol–1 lower than the equivalent PuO2(HX)(NO3)(CH3OH) compounds for HX =
HA, HB, and HC, respectively. Finally, the Gibbs free energies of
formation of the AmO2(HX)2 compounds are 20.84,
13.90, and 27.44 kcal mol–1 lower than for the AmO2(HX)(NO3)(CH3OH) compounds, for HX =
HA, HB, and HC, respectively.

The largest difference between
contiguous actinides is calculated
to be between Pu and Am, followed by Np and Pu, with the smallest
difference between U and Np in both AnO2(HX)2 and AnO2(HX)(NO3)(CH3OH) configurations
(shown in Figure 7).
The difference in Gibbs free energy of reaction between contiguous
actinides is between 0.21 and 17.35 kcal mol–1 for
AnO2(HA)(NO3)(CH3OH) and AnO2(HA)2, between 0.23 and 16.80 for AnO2(HB)(NO3)(CH3OH) and AnO2(HB)2, and between 1.43 and 17.42 for AnO2(HC)(NO3)(CH3OH) and AnO2(HC)2 (Tables 4 and 6).

and plutonyl compounds are calculated with DFT and MP2 and relative
to AnO2(HB)(NO3)(CH3OH) to show relative
Gibbs free energies with respect to the least stable compound amongst
the uranyl and plutonyl compounds tested. Overall, it is observed
that the differences in relative Gibbs free energies of formation
predicted with DFT are between 0.13 and 1.60 kcal mol–1 from those predicted with MP2. UO2(HA)(NO3)(CH3OH) shows a ΔGrxn 10.86 and 9.45 kcal mol–1 lower than UO2(HB)(NO3)(CH3OH) when calculated with DFT and
MP2, respectively. Similarly, UO2(HC)(NO3)(CH3OH) presents a ΔGrxn 20.11
and 20.77 kcal mol–1 lower than UO2(HB)(NO3)(CH3OH), when calculated with DFT and MP2, respectively.
The ΔGrxn of UO2(HA)2 are 33.91 and 32.48 kcal mol–1 lower than
UO2(HB)(NO3)(CH3OH) calculated with
DFT and MP2, respectively. UO2(HB)2 gives ΔGrxn 13.94 and 14.07 kcal mol–1 lower than UO2(HB)(NO3)(CH3OH)
with DFT and MP2, respectively. Finally, the ΔGrxn of UO2(HC)2 are 50.28 and 51.86
kcal mol–1 lower than UO2(HB)(NO3)(CH3OH) calculated with DFT and MP2, respectively.
Differences in predicted Gibbs free energies of reaction calculated
with DFT and MP2 are shown in Tables 4 and 6.

Sun et al. studied
similar compounds with a single HA and HB ligand
and two water molecules bound to uranyl and predicted the AnO2(HC)(OH2)2e compound
to be more stable than AnO2(HB)(OH2)2.24 Ansari et al. found that NpO2(HC)2f was weaker than UO2(HC)2.38 Both findings are
consistent to our predicted results.

Discussion
Overall,
it is observed that the An–N2 bond length in compounds
with the HB ligand is shorter than with HA and HC. Moreover, no distinct
difference in An–N2 bond length is observed in the compounds
with the HA ligand with respect to those with the HC ligand, which
correlates to the compounds with the HB ligand having a lower Gibbs
free energy of reaction than the compounds with HA and HC ligands.
This trend is observed for both the AnO2(HX)(NO3)(CH3OH) and AnO2(HX)2 configurations.
Furthermore, the HB ligand shows a higher electron-withdrawing effect
than HA and HC. In summary, an increase in An–N2 bond length
and an increase in electron donation from the dioxime ligands correlates
to stronger complexation of the actinyls with the HA and HC ligands
than with the HB ligand. All three atoms (O3, O4, and N2) contribute
to the binding energy. Therefore, if the nitrogen is closer to the
actinide, as seen for HB, this causes the oxygen atoms to be in less
favorable angles, which may disrupt their binding to the actinide
effectively causing the total ligand binding energy to be lower.

Uranyl, neptunyl, plutonyl, and americyl present a stronger binding
in the AnO2(HC)2 configuration, followed by
AnO2(HA)2, AnO2(HC)(NO3)(CH3OH), AnO2(HB)2, AnO2(HA)(NO3)(CH3OH), and the weakest binding in
the AnO2(HB)(NO3)(CH3OH) configuration.
This result is in parallel with the calculated electron-donating effects
of the ligand with HC– and HA– to be the most electron-donating ligands, followed by HB– being the least electron donating. Not surprisingly, the electron-donating
effects from NO3– were less than those
of HX–, which is in line with the result that the
AnO2(HX)(NO3)(CH3OH) compounds are
less stable than the corresponding UO2(HA)2 compounds.

Calculated Gibbs free energies of reaction for AnO2(HX)(NO3)(CH3OH) and AnO2(HX)2, with
An = U, Np, Pu, and Am and HX = HA, HB, and HC following the proposed
formation reaction indicated in eqs 1a, 1b and 2a, 2b show that the most stable compounds are
found when complexing Pu(VI), least stable when complexing Am(VI),
and present similar stability for U(VI) with respect to Np(VI). Overall,
all of the configurations studied show a stronger binding to plutonyl,
followed by uranyl and neptunyl, and with americyl having the weakest
binding. None of the configurations presented would be efficient at
separating uranyl from neptunyl in an environment as proposed in eqs 1a, 1b and 2a, 2b.

In conclusion,
the compounds with aliphatic amidoximes form more
stable complexes than the aromatic amidoximes. The An–N2 bond
length increases as the binding strength increases. The HA and HC
ligands show a larger electron donation than the HB ligands, and all
ligands are more electron donating than NO3–, supporting the finding that the AnO2(HX)2 compounds have a stronger binding between the ligands and the actinyl
cation than the corresponding AnO2(HX)(NO3)(CH3OH) compounds.

Additionally, the plutonyl cation is
the most electron-withdrawing
actinyl within the compounds studied, while presenting the strongest
binding. Moreover, the improved conjugation through the five-membered
ring containing the nitrogen in HB as opposed to the six-membered
ring in HA is likely a significant factor to be considered in ligand
design, as the double bond on the back of the five-membered ring contributes
to the aromatic stabilization as an anion. This effect is seen for
all other five-membered heterocycles (such as imidazole or triazole)
when they are anionic. Consequently, we would suggest that for designing
future ligands a six-membered backbone is preferred to five-membered
example since this “decouples” the conjugation from
the backbone of the ligand.

Methods
Structural properties and
Gibbs free energies of reaction are calculated
in the gas phase for the uranyl, neptunyl, plutonyl and americyl cations
complexed with acenaphtho[1,2-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole
8,8-dioxide (Np-CAO-H2)U(O)2(NO3)(CH3OH) (H2A), phthalimidedioxime (H2B),
and glutarimidedioxime (H2C). Two motifs are proposed,
AnO2(HX)(NO3)(CH3OH) and AnO2(HX)2, where HX represents the singly deprotonated
ligand (with X = A, B, and C corresponding to H2A, H2B, and H2C) and An includes U, Np, Pu, and Am.
The proposed structures are shown in Figure 1.

The reactions studied for the formation
of the proposed compounds
are shown in eqs 1a and 1b. 1a   1b  The Gibbs free energy of reaction for eqs 1a, 1b and 2a, 2b is calculated
as indicated in eqs 2a and 2b, respectively. 2a   2b  The differences in Gibbs free energy of reaction
[Δ(ΔG)rxn] values shown are
relative to those corresponding to AmO2(HB)(NO3)(CH3OH) and are calculated as indicated in eqs 3a and 3b, with
An = U, Np, and Pu and HX = HA, HB, and HC. 3a   3b  The protocol followed in
this study begins
with geometry optimizations obtained with density functional theory
(DFT), using the B3LYP39 functional, the
Stuttgart RSC 1997 ECP and associated basis set for U, Np, Pu, and
Am, and the 6-311++G** basis set for O, N, C, and H, with tight tolerances
and extra fine grid. The ECP on the actinide atom accounts for scalar
relativistic effects by replacing 60 electrons with a relativistic
pseudopotential. The molecules were optimized without imposing symmetry
constraints explicitly to avoid enforcing a preconceived symmetry
onto the systems studied. Therefore, the initial orbitals utilized
in the optimization would not have been exactly degenerate as the
starting point did not have high symmetry. Thermochemical corrections
are calculated at 298.15 K. Gibbs free energies of reaction are calculated
on structures optimized with DFT. MP2 calculations are single point
energy calculations utilizing the thermochemical corrections obtained
with DFT. The correlation space considered in the MP2 calculations
included all electrons and orbitals that are not included in the ECP.

Following the geometry optimizations, NBO analysis is included
in the protocol to establish orbital occupancies and electron-withdrawing
and -donation effects and partial charges of the fragments in the
compounds studied. Structural characteristics are then correlated
to electron-withdrawing and -donation effects to provide information
of the selectivity preferences and compounds’ stability from
a structural perspective. Finally, the protocol includes the calculation
of Gibbs free energies of reaction as a complement to binding preferences
predicted from structural and electronic effects.

Utilizing
the B3LYP functional, the Stuttgart RSC 1997 ECP and
basis set for U and the 6-311++G** basis set for the non-U atoms is
commonly accepted to provide accurate geometries for uranyl compounds.40−50 A previous study of [An(NO3)]2+ structures
established that utilizing the 6-31G*, cc-pVDZ, 6-311++G**, cc-pVTZ,
and cc-pVQZ basis set for non-An atoms, the Stuttgart RSC 1997 ECP
and associated basis set for the actinides include all of the basis
functions in the basis set, while changing the functional (LDA, TPSS,
B3LYP, PBE0, and B972) predicted structures with an An–O distance
of less than 0.03 Å and an O–An–O angle difference
of less than 1°.36 In the current
study, the strongly constrained and appropriately normed semilocal
(SCAN)51 density functional is also included
as it had not yet been tested for actinides. The SCAN functional is
utilized to analyze structural characteristics, population analysis,
and differences in predicted Gibbs free energies of reaction of the
uranyl compounds with relative to those predicted with B3LYP.

All DFT geometry optimizations and vibrational frequencies calculations
are obtained with the NWChem 6.5 and 6.6 package (for B3LYP only studies).52 The NBO53 population
analysis is obtained with the natural bond orbital 6.0 (NBO6) program.54 Molpro201555 is used
for MP2 calculations. The uranyl structures for the B3LYP and SCAN
comparison are obtained with NWChem 6.8.52 NWChem calculations used default convergence criteria of 10–7 for energy and 10–5 for density.
Basis sets are obtained from the Environmental Molecular Sciences
Laboratory (EMSL) database.56,57

Vibrational frequency
calculations reveal some complex frequencies
(with magnitude no larger than 77 cm–1). Visualization
of the vibrational modes reveals that none of the complex frequency
modes represents significant modes likely to affect the structural
characteristics discussed in this study, as complex frequencies stem
from in-and-out of plane bending modes of the molecular structure,
which do not affect the bond lengths and angles discussed in this
study. From the vibrational modes in each compound [108, 90, 87, 153,
117, and 111 for AnO2(HA)(NO3)(CH3OH), AnO2(HB)(NO3)(CH3OH), AnO2(HC)(NO3)(CH3OH), AnO2(HA)2, AnO2(HB)2, and AnO2(HC)2, respectively], no more than two complex modes were found
per compound. The zero-point energy (ZPE) contribution is less than
0.02% of the Gibbs free energy of the compound, which indicates that
there is a small contribution to the 0 K zero-point vibrational correction
and that omitting these modes from the vibrational analysis the thermal
correction to the energy would be slightly underestimated. Moreover,
the entropy contribution is less than 0.0002% of the Gibbs free energy
of the compounds. Consequently, it can be established that the effect
of the complex modes onto the analysis provided in this manuscript
is inconsequential. The effect of numerical error increases from finite
differences, which explains that the larger compounds having larger
magnitudes of complex frequencies than the smaller compounds. The
magnitude of all complex frequencies for all compounds is included
in Table S.1 in the SI. The ZPE and entropy
contribution to the Gibbs free energy for all compounds are shown
in Tables S.2 and S.3, respectively, in
the SI.

The maximum spin contaminations from the unrestricted
DFT wavefunction
are 0.00, 0.01, 0.13, 0.17 for the U, Np, Pu, and Am compounds, respectively.
Restricted and unrestricted DFT calculations for the UO2(HA)(NO3)(CH3OH) compound give a difference
of 5.3 × 10–4 kcal mol–1 in
total energy, 0.797 kcal mol–1 in ZPE, 0.067 kcal
mol–1 for the thermal correction to the enthalpy,
and 1.30 × 10–5 kcal mol–1 for the entropy. The MP2 calculations are obtained with a restricted
open shell.

Conclusions
Effective calculations can accelerate the
design of efficient extracting
agents for actinide separations, which is critical for multiple industrial
processes. Predictive capabilities, including analysis of structural
characteristics with electron-donation and -withdrawing effects, are
a useful aid to predict binding selectivity. We have studied a series
of ligands and actinides that are relevant for separations based on
previous experimental studies. Variations in predicted characteristics
obtained when altering the functional of choice suggest that researchers
can apply the protocol used in this study to predict binding preferences
through analysis of structural characteristics affected by electron-withdrawing
effects, however, cautious conclusions must be made from calculations
of Gibbs free energies of reaction. Future work includes studying
higher levels of theory and multireference character, relativistic
effects, and effects of solvation on the structures in this study
for future application in liquid separations.
