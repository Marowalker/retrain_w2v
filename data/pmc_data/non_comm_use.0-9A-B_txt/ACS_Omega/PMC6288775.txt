Electroporation
characterization is a topic of intensive interest
probed by extensive ongoing research efforts. Usually, these studies
are carried out on lipid-bilayer electroporation. Surprisingly, the
possibility of water-channel electropore formation across transmembrane
proteins themselves, particularly in view of such a promising application,
has not yet been elucidated. The present work examines the geometrical
and kinetic aspects of electropores and their stability in such a
protein milieux (as opposed through the phospholipid membranes) in
depth, by means of scrutiny of such a process in human-AQP4 as a well-representative
prototype. The residues forming the electropore’s walls, organized
in loops, reveal the formation mechanism by their dipole alignment
and translational response in response to applied axial electric fields
in nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation. The magnitude of
sustaining electric fields (keeping a stable electropore open) were
determined. This suggests that transmembrane proteins could play a
central role in electroporation applications, e.g., in medicine and
biotechnology.

Introduction
The membrane phospholipid bilayer can
be studied as a thin isolating
sheet dividing two electrolyte solutions and enveloping intracellular
components and organelles.1 If this structure
is exposed to an electric field pulse able to induce a transmembrane
potential above a certain threshold value, the cell membrane will
be permeabilized.2 Depending on the duration
of the pulse and the field intensity, the two systems on either side
of the bilayer will no longer be isolated if electroporation through
the membrane occurs, and molecules that could not flow through the
transport-selective endogenous channels in bilayer-embedded proteins
are then allowed to permeate through the electroporated membrane.3 The transiently reversible opening of the cell
enables drugs and oligonucleotides to be transported, in addition
to, inter alia, antibodies, permitting the initiation of biological
events by changing the inside of the cell.4

The mechanistic detail of how pores form under the action
of applied
electric fields is inherently challenging to be elucidated by experiments;
conversely, this is entirely possible to explore using carefully conducted
molecular dynamics (MD) simulation due to the very short time scales
of the pore-formation process and also the small space scale of lipid
pores (a few nanometers).5 According to
MD simulations of lipid bilayers, nanometer-sized aqueous pores are
formed inside the lipid bilayers during the pulse application6 and the kinetics of the opening and closure of
these pores appear to be on the order of nanoseconds.7 However, this description is not completely satisfactory,
since it does not take into consideration, for instance, that ultrashort
pulses with a very high amplitude (tens of kV/cm) and duration of
a few nanoseconds, called nanopulses, have displayed long-term effects
on membrane permeability and conductivity of cells and tissues, most
probably due to oxidation of the membrane phospholipids induced by
the field.8

Even if not yet fully
demonstrated, another option of long-lasting
(electropore) permeability due to nanopulses could be related to the
involvement of transmembrane proteins when cells are exposed to such
short and intense electric fields. Recent in vitro studies have considered
the possibility that nanopulses could influence specific ion channel
behavior as voltage-gated ion channels in bovine chromaffin cells,9 whereas in a separate study, it has been proven
that the calcium increase induced by ultrashort pulsed electric fields
was mediated by voltage-gated calcium channels.10 Further evidence of specific involvement of voltage-sensitive
ion channels has been presented in ref (11), whereas activation of membrane protein modulated
directly by Ca2+ has been shown in ref (12).

As a whole indeed,
a rather tantalizing, and as-yet elusive, prospect
coming from this exciting suggestion concerns the idea of controlling
a drug-release course, e.g., exploiting liposomes as carriers. A potentially
promising lead for achieving such a desired effect lies in aquaporins
(AQPs) as prototypical water-conducting transmembrane proteins.13,14

In general, AQP proteins form water-conducting channels. It
is
interesting to observe that because of external agents,15 human-AQP4 may undergo inner structural changes
as well. According to X-ray analysis,16 it has been observed how water flow might diminish due to narrow
constrictions at the cytoplasm end. Indeed, MD computations have highlighted
this mechanistically, showing the translation of a histidine59 residue obstructing water passage.

In
mammals, there are up to 11 different AQPs,18 each one with a different role and location; however, they
can be found in erythrocytes as well as in glands responsible for
water secretion of saliva and sweat. A crucial role is also played
in urea production and water retention in kidneys;19 in humans, genetically defective AQPs lead to several diseases,
including a rare form of diabetes20 and
polyurea. An important human aquaporin is h-AQP4,21 a transmembrane protein that faces both the cytoplasmic
and the extracellular environment as shown in Figure 1. Under physiological conditions, only four
endogenous channels can be observed, but an intense driving force
can induce the presence of a fifth pore. The latter creates as really
small, or “finger-sized”, pore at early stages and then
becomes more stable.

Figure 1 Left: top view (downwards, essentially along the laboratory z-axis) of the h-AQP4 embedded in the membrane (showing
a fifth pore, the electropore in the middle of the four established,
endogenous channels); right: lateral view, along the laboratory x–z planar direction.

This tetramer is embedded in the lipid bilayer
and it is possible
to refer to the top and bottom ends of these four different channels.
If this protein is mutated though, two kinds of main problems can
arise—deafness22 and cerebral edema.23 The few molecules that interact with aquaporin
are usually toxic and subjected to strict selectivity criteria due
to h-AQP4 configurations. A two-stage mechanism filter generally takes
place.24 In the middle of the channel,
the first filter, made of two NPA motifs,16,25 is observed; ions’ permeability is impeded because of the
activation of a strong electrical barrier. Besides this early mechanism,
which can be described crudely, but effectively, by the presence of
micro-dipoles,26 there is another filter—the
eponymous selectivity filter.16 This spatially
selective filter controls and modulates the passage of water, in addition
to certain other solutes.

The present study focuses on the molecular
mechanism of pore formation
by external intense electric fields, in a particular AQP family, i.e.,
human AQP4, as it plays a key role in water homeostasis.27 In particular, a principal aim of this work
lies in elucidating the role of transmembrane proteins (specifically
h-AQP4) in the kinetics of electropore formation. Here, the use of
nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) allows the study of the formation
of electropores, both by the dipolar-orientation and translational
response of residues in the AQP4 lining both endogenous channels and
electropores, and by geometrical visualization and characterization
of the electropores.28

As will be
shown later, the electropore is typically created in
the protein itself prior to its establishment across the membrane.
Indeed, to observe the creation of a stable electropore, it is necessary,
ipso facto, to work under extreme field-intensity conditions, because
of the limited accessible molecular-simulation time spans of nonequilibrium
molecular dynamics (NEMD) in externally applied electric fields, as
has been illustrated vividly for lipid-bilayer electroporation studies;29,30 a sufficient field strength to induce electroporation is of hundreds
of megavolts per meter.29,31 With an intense applied
electric field, the large “activation energy” required
to initiate pore formation can be overcome in a reasonable time window
(<100 ns).32,33 Under these circumstances, the
pore formation process can be easily followed, but the pore expands
to the size of the simulated bilayer patch (<100 nm2 in most all-atom MD simulations of phospholipid bilayers), and strong
finite-size effects appear. From NEMD, the molecular mechanism of
electroporation has been unveiled,5,30,32 at least for phospholipid bilayers, and the different
stages of pore formation have been characterized.34 At the same
time, recent studies have also unveiled the role of an intense electric
field in inducing protein structural transitions or denaturation pathways
also including the role of water.35−38

In any event, in the present
study, the simulated system is strikingly
different from the earlier systems analyzed in the literature, since
no transmembrane protein has been reported in any MD-based study of
hydrophilic electropores. The first intriguing queries are about which
domain is the first affected by the (high-intensity) porating field?
Is the field inducing protein destructuring or just lipids’
rearrangements? Can we observe water-channels creation within the
protein core (given that the four endogenous pores remain active)
or do they appear only within the lipid double layer? Indeed, in further
mechanistic detail, sustaining a stable electropore is not trivial,
although different lower intensities, compared with the main pore-formation
field, have been investigated (vide infra). It turns out that a sustaining
electric field works in this respect as long as the main field has
been applied for at least one whole nanosecond according to the simulation
carried out here; otherwise, resealing occurs. The effect of these
two different fields can be unveiled by studying the transient temporal
behavior of these residues’ dipole response to the applied
field, and those defined as the most significant, especially considering
their role in permeability shifts. It is well known how endogenous
AQP4 channels have a bottom and a top filter, whereas in a putative
fifth electropore, the most significant permeability-promoting residues
would be suspected to be those adjoining the pore wall. Indeed, tackling
these foregoing open questions and considerations constitute a powerful
motivation for us to study electroporation in transmembrane proteins.

Results
Electropore
Formation
A priming NEMD simulation in
the presence of a high-intensity porating field was run; more specifically,
a uniform electric field was applied along the positive and negative z-axes for 5 ns. By visual inspection, we analyzed the NEMD
trajectory, and observed the electropore creation times. As apparent
from the intraprotein electropore is formed before the intramembrane
electropore, coupled with a strong rearrangements of protein central
residues (vide infra). This latter kind of electropore appears slowly
divergent in size, compared with intraprotein electropores, quickly
leading the membrane patch to irreversible expansion, borne of outright
mechanical instability. Figure 2 depicts the intraprotein electropore appearance for the simulation.
The water molecules penetrating the protein core are shown in blue
to highlight their position, perfectly central, with respect to the
four h-AQP4 endogenous pores.

Figure 2 Water molecules within the simulated system
taken at t = 150 ps; ions, lipids, and protein residues
are not shown to enhance
the visualization of the central intraprotein electropore (in blue).

For both intraprotein and intramembrane
electropores, this limitation
is an obstacle to the study of the properties and behavior of long-lasting,
quasi-stable pores that are believed to exist in living, electroporated
cell membranes on the basis of experimental evidence, including ion
conductance.39 It is worth noting at this
point that the latter experimental evidence does not elucidate the
underlying nature of such putative electropores, i.e., whether the
water channel is created between the two membrane leaflets or through
transmembrane proteins.

Following the methodology proposed by
Fernández and co-workers,40 consisting
of a two-step protocol based on the
observation that the electropores formed in MD simulations can be
stabilized by reducing the applied electric field from a higher porating
value to a range of lower stabilizing values, one can obtain an equilibrium
condition for the electropore and thus characterize its properties
with statistical soundness. We did so, which evinced structural (meta-)stability;
vide infra.

Electropore Characterization
In
the first 5 ns of the
simulation, as shown in Figure 3, a widening actually occurs, but over 4 ns mechanical disruption
is observed. This latter disruption is an irreversible electroporation
event, in that it is permanent, and the study of water flux through
this was not undertaken. This is the main reason why, immediately
after the formation of an electropore, a lower sustaining external
field should be applied; we found that up to ∼0.02 V/Å
applied along the +z-axis could work well in this
respect. Several different behaviors, occurring in particular residues,
play a key role in electropore formation and in shaping them. Considering
the pore as made of two halves, top and bottom, the residues can be
listed systematically. Starting from the very first residue in the
top half, one has ASP 69, LEU 72, VAL 71, LEU75, LEU 79; the bottom
half consists of PHE 195, LEU 191, SER 188, GLY 187, THR 186, VAL
185. Each of the 11 residues of the electropore is nested in a different
wall: hence, each is present four times, with each wall of the electropore
originating from one of the four different endogenous h-AQP4 channels.

Figure 3 Evolution
of the pore as seen from “above” along
the laboratory z-axis is followed, with one “frame”
sampled each picosecond from the instance of external-field exposure.
Widening, leading to mechanical disruption, is readily evident starting
from 1800 ps.

We plot in Figure 4 the evolution of the intraprotein
radius section along the channel
(cf. Materials and Methods). Here, a complete
profile of the pore radius along the length of the electropore is
provided. It is possible to observe, especially in the top half, an
increasing effect of the electric field with the simulation time,
hence providing a clear picture of the pore dynamics. Corresponding
to ASP 69, VAL 71, LEU 72, and LEU 75, the first effect, small but
highly relevant, is noticed at 150 ps: a variation of 0.3 Å with
respect to the physiological (i.e., the unexposed simulation condition)
loop radius of VAL 71, which seemingly triggers the beginning of the
membrane poration (see Figure 2). Note that for the initial structure, the radius calculations
suggest the presence of a sort of central endogenous channel that is too narrow for water permeation.
After 1800 ps, considered as the time needed to obtain a well-formed
electropore configuration, the transmembrane pore radius has widened
by about 1.3 Å compared with the initial structure (cf. Figure 4). This very configuration
is considered to be the one used to define a well-formed pore.31 Such a result is legitimized by the rough structural
transition of the pore, which occurs just after this time frame. Corresponding
to LEU 72, a variation of 0.5 Å is computed just between 1.8
and 2 ns, indicating that an irreversible expansion of the intraprotein
electropore has taken place.

Figure 4 Evolution of the electropore’s shape
during the priming
simulation, with one frame sampled each picosecond from the instance
of external-field exposure. The most stable shape is observed between
1 and 2 ns following field exposure, during which the bulk of simulations
was conducted in sustaining electric fields with different starting
points from simulation #1 (vide infra).

Pore Quasi-Stability Achieved by a Sustaining Field
Once
the electropore is created, it is necessary to act on a maintaining
field to avoid both resealing and mechanical disruption. As mentioned
previously, the field strength adopted, exerted along the +z-axis, is 0.05 V/Å. Different subsequent trajectories,
primed with starting points from this simulation (mostly from 1 to
2 ns, from overall-shape considerations of Figure 4), have been run with various lower external-field
intensities. Priming “sustaining-field” simulations
from the first 150–500 ps of simulation #1 leads to the electropore’s
fast resealing (data not shown). Moving further in time in simulation
#1, the water load through the electropore increases and, eventually,
up to 1 ns, a larger pore is observed; but that reseals too when the
system is subjected to a lower-intensity field. In any event, in these
subsequent, lower-field simulations, the sustaining field strengths
investigated were 0, 0.005, 0.0075, 0.01, 0.015, and 0.02 V/Å.

Simulations starting from 1.3 to 1.5 ns, around 20 ns long, have
shown resealing of pores as long as the maintaining intensity was
lower than 0.02 V/Å. Visual inspection via the visual molecular
dynamics (VMD) program reveals that, even if the resealing has not
(yet) happened over ∼20 ns, the stable pore is small and reducing
gradually in radius, albeit not quite yet finger-sized (cf. Figure 2). On the other hand,
if the sustaining field is applied after 2 ns from the priming simulation,
one of the endogenous channels seems to be compromised by the electropore
enlargement. After 1.9 ns, the sustaining field of 0.02 V/Å induces
a quasi-stable electropore, but a prominent “touching”
contact between it and one of the endogenous channels becomes persistent
after ∼35 ns. After extensive, careful checking and visualization,
a large, quasi-stable electropore is maintained by a 0.02 V/Å
field, over up to ∼50 ns from which simulations were run for
starting points at 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8 ns from the porating field simulation. Figure 5 shows the time evolution
of the transprotein electropore radius, studied from the perspective
of four VAL 71 residues’ loop, during the porating field application
(red curve) and in two different sustaining field scenarios: (i) the
first one referred to a well-formed pore at 1500 ps (green curve);
(ii) the second one referred to a well-formed pore at 1800 ps (blue
curve). Although, at first glance, similar by simple visual inspection,
the two starting configurations at 1500 and 1800 ps lead to completely
different electropore dynamics, as apparent from the figure.

Figure 5 Time evolution
of the electropore, studied from the perspective
of VAL 71. On the left side is portrayed the effect of the poration
field within the first 1300 ps; on the right hand is shown the effect
of a sustaining field E = 0.02 V/Å applied right
after the porating field has been enforced for 1300 ps. It is necessary
to wait longer to avoid resealing.

The main objective of this section lies in the analysis of
the
transprotein electropore quasi-stable dynamics when the electric sustaining
field is applied after 1800 ps from the porating field simulation,
given the intrinsic stability of the pore geometry within 1500 ps.
The field effect on the transprotein structural rearrangements can
be soundly linked to the coupling with the intrinsic dipoles of protein
residues’ dipoles. In particular, we focused on the top-half
single residues. Each residue has been analyzed, computing the dipole
moment with respect to its center of mass, but only the most interesting
residues, according to the magnitude of the coupling with the electric
field, have been studied thoroughly. Hence, in Figure 6, the probability distribution of the z-component (the same direction of the exogenous applied
field) of the dipole moment corresponding to the very top protein
residue, ASP 69, is portrayed. To appreciate the coupling effect of
the exogenous field with such dipoles, we considered three different
cases: (i) physiological conditions, represented by a 10 ns equilibrium
simulation (i.e., no field is applied); (ii) the application of the
0.05 V/Å porating field until 1800 ps; (iii) the application
of a 0.02 V/Å sustaining field, starting from a well-formed transprotein
electropore configuration. In the figure, it is possible to outline,
under physiological conditions, two different dipolar states, only
barely hinted in the second protein monomer (B). The conclusion to
be drawn from this kind of observation is related to the occurrence
of an angular flip of the dipole associated with the residue. During
the poration-field application, this flip does not occur at all, and
the dipole populates only one of the two states initially available.
When the sustaining field is applied, it is possible to notice a partial
return to the initial pre-exposition condition, although in ASP 69A
and ASP 69C (protein first and third monomers), the dipole polarization
seems to be still irreversible, at least during the simulation duration
(20 ns).

Figure 6 ASP 69 probability distribution functions of the z component of the dipolar moment in each of the four walls. The plots
represent (i), (ii), and (iii) situations depicted as blue, red, and
light green curves, respectively.

Discussion
In the present contribution, many aspects
of pore formation in
transmembrane proteins have been discussed. If one correlates the
pore formation event with a strong dipolar coupling with the exogenous
electric field, we verified in Figure 6, a clear shift of the ASP 69 residue dipole moment
in correspondence to the porating field application. This event matches
with the disappearance of one of the two accessible ASP 69 dipolar
states appreciated in the unexposed simulation. To verify the connection
of this result with the location of electropore appearance, which
seems more frequent within the transmembrane protein than in the membrane,
ASP 69 was chosen as a representative of the membrane dipolar coupling
with the field. Figure 7a represents the probability distribution of the z-component of the 12 lipid heads dipole (lipid cores are neutral,
see Figure 7b). As
shown in Figure 7b,
the lipid heads have been drawn from the corner of the box, since
it was desired to make the calculation as close as possible to bulk
conditions, exploiting periodic boundary conditions. A significant
effect, equivalent or stronger compared with that of ASP 69 residues,
due to the porating field is observed. Nevertheless, looking at the
unexposed simulation, in contrast to the results shown in Figure 7a, no distinguishable
dipolar states are present. The effect of the porating field, although
clear, is partially hidden by the wide probability distribution profile,
making less immediate the relation between dipole rotations and water
molecules’ protrusion into the membrane.

Figure 7 (a) Upper: probability
distribution function of the lipid’s
dipole moments; the red curve is characteristic of the unexposed case,
whereas the light green curve shows the shift relative to the dipolar
moment when the porating field is applied. (b) Lower: the lipid dipole
moments shown in panel (a) are averaged over 12 lipid heads, close
to the corner of the system, as visualized in VMD; indeed, it is possible
to observe the polar heads of the lipids in the upper leaflet, highlighted
as they represent the only charged moieties within the lipid structure.

Figure 3 shows how
after a main field is applied, sustaining the electropore is of paramount
importance to avoid mechanical disruption. When enforcing a strong
static electric field, such as E = 0.05 V/Å,
time and sustaining field intensities have been studied thoroughly.
The aim, after witnessing water-finger formation and the birth of
a small pore, is of maintaining a large stable one. It turns out,
as hinted in Figure 5, that it is not possible to sustain a (quasi-)stable electropore
when moving out of the time interval 1–2 ns. The pore either
reseals within the first 10 ns or diverges, tending to devour one
of the endogenous channels. The only intensity suitable, and reliable,
for this task appeared to be 0.02 V/Å. In fact, for sustaining
fields applied after 1.6, 1.7, or 1.8 ns of 0.05 V/Å-field exposure,
the electropore was stable for 20 ns-long runs, and longer still.
Such stable pores have been characterized in terms of geometry and
dipolar mechanism. Under these circumstances, ionic conductivity events
have been recorded and will be explored further thoroughly in a future
publication.

The variation of permeability can be possibly linked
to the number
of hydrogen bonds (HB) within the electropore. This analysis was carried
on in the VMD setting of an acceptor–donor (O···O)
distance of 3.5 Å along with an angle (H–O···O)
smaller than 30°. These parameters were selected according to
the standard set by Farimani et al.,41 although
they do not mimic the precise hydrogen-bond conditions of ref (41). In their pioneering work,41 based on CNTs, the enhancement of permeability
was a consequence of a decrease in the number of hydrogen bonds over
the peripheral regions of the CNT wall, since the number of hydrogen
bonds essentially determines the degrees of freedom for water molecules.
On the basis of this well-known geometrical effect, we decided to
relate the number of hydrogen bonds during the application of a 0.05
V/Å porating field to the electropore’s structural transition
reported in Figure 4. The dynamics of the hydrogen bonds within the residues surrounding
the electropore and between such residues and water molecules within
the electropore were both investigated. It is apparent from Figure 8 that within the
time interval representative of electropore expansion, the number
of protein–protein hydrogen bonds decreases in a monotonic
fashion (only for protein residues identified in the previous section),
reaching a plateau region after 1700 ps, where a 0.02 V/Å electric
field is sufficient to sustain a stable electropore. When considering
the number of protein–water hydrogen bonds, on the other hand,
the opposite behavior is observed, which can be related to the enlargement
of the water channel within the electropore. It is worth noting that
the percentage variation in the number of hydrogen bonds is much larger
within the selected protein residues, indicative of a strong interaction
with the exogenous electric field.

Figure 8 Effect of the porating field (E = 0.05 V/Å)
on the number of hydrogen bonds in the electropore region in the first
2000 ps, before mechanical disruption takes place. On the left-hand
side, the HB number within the protein is reported, whereas on the
right-hand side, the HB number stemming from the interaction of water
molecules with the protein is reported. Red curves represent data
smoothed with a moving average filter with a 30% span.

Conclusions
The physical mechanisms
underlying the interaction of electric
pulses and cell membranes have not been fully elucidated, in particular,
concerning the involvement and specific role of transmembrane proteins.
Molecular dynamics simulations has proven to be a valid tool for the
investigation of such interactions also due to the difficulties in
performing experiments on such nanometer scales.

Here, we have
scrutinized geometric and kinetic aspects of transmembrane
electroporation and assessed their resultant underlying stability.
Mechanistic analysis of electropore wall dipole alignment reveals
the subtle interplay of, and dependence on, translational and rotational
response in response to axially applied electric fields. In particular,
the ASP 69 residue (overlooking the extracellular medium) exhibits
two accessible states upon field exposure, and when the field is enforced,
only one holds, whereas the lipid heads show no transition from one
state to the other. This signifies, we conjecture, the lower propensity
of lipids to reorganize in the case of the embedded h-AQP4 to reorganize
to allow electropore formation therein, displaying faster underlying
dynamics than standard lipid electropores. In addition, we must emphasize
the key role of hydrogen bonds in terms of breaking and reformation
in applied fields as of paramount importance in determining the details
of electroporation subsequent stability, mediated by dipole rotational
and transitional field response. Indeed, the occasional observation
of ionic-conductivity events through the electropore (not discussed
here) is an interesting phenomenon, which we intend to study further.

With the very recent and exciting advent of high-quality, large-field
experimental studies on electroporation, showing reversible electropermeabilization,42,43 and more general studies on protein structure and function manipulation
(reaching up to the 0.01 V/Å range),44 the importance of NEMD simulation as an accompanying tool for hand-in-glove
progress with electric-field experiments is to be noted.

Materials and
Methods
Molecular Modelling
The trajectories are simulated
making use of NAMD v2.945,46 starting from an h-AQP4
Protein Data Bank47 entry 3GD8 file. This
configuration is open to different protonation states. Keeping this
in mind, hydrogen atoms were added, in the CHARMM27 topology internal
coordinates,48,49 to be consistent with pH 7.5.
This tetramer is then embedded in a palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylethanolamine
lipid bilayer, which is solvated and equilibrated. The membrane’s
overlapping lipids were removed and a solvation shell of 20 Å
is added on the ±z axes. This entire system
is made electrically neutral by the presence of Na+ and
Cl– ions, the resulting concentration being 55 mM.
The resulting periodic cell volume is 101 × 101 × 80 Å3.

Molecular Dynamics Simulation
CHARMM2749 and TIP3P50 potential models
were used. CHARMM27 is a nonpolarizable potential, in contrast to
previous work of English et al.,51−53 but returns qualitative
acceptable outcomes.54 Long-range electrostatic
interactions were handled by the particle mesh Ewald method, making
use of r-RESPA decomposition.59 Each simulation
relies on an NPT reservoir for coupling. The reservoir pressure and
temperature point were set respectively to 1 atm and 298 K. Temperature
was controlled through a Langevin thermostat with a damping coefficient
of 1 ps–1.55−57 The applied electric field was
static, and acted in the direction of the positive z-axis; as reported above, a strength of 0.05 V/Å led to electroporation.
The static-field force was applied to atomic partial charges, using f = qE0. This kind of system
response of water to electric fields in nanoscale geometries embedded
in phospholipid bilayers has been studied extensively by Garate and
co-workers.59,58,60,61

Pore Profile
To obtain the cross-sectional
area of
the electropore, an equivalent-area method was implemented, keeping
in mind that each of the 11 residues is at a slightly different “height”
along the z-axes. Here, we consider a square as composed
of two triangles, whose areas are computed through Heron’s
formula      where A is the cross-sectional
area, l1, l2, and l3 are the side lengths, and p is the semiperimeter, i.e., 1/2(l1 + l2 + l5). The radius of the circle inscribed in the square, as shown
in Figure 9, provides
a rough estimate of the electropore radius within a given residue
loop.

Figure 9 Pores are made of 11 loops, each one consisting of a repetition
of four identical residues. The centers of mass of the residues for

triangles, obtained by Heron’s formula, it is possible to estimate
the radius of the pore corresponding to a given loop.
