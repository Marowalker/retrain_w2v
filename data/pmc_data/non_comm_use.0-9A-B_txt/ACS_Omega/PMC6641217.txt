The
performance of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is strongly
affected by optical, structural, and electronic features of a photoanode.
In this article, meso-TiO2–X was
prepared by a solution combustion method and hydrogenation at high
pressure. The properties of DSSCs with meso-TiO2–X photoanodes were investigated by photocurrent–voltage,
incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency, and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The meso-TiO2–X materials exhibit new electronic states and aided
to absorb in the visible region because of the narrow band gap. Facile
charge transfer from the N719 dye to the TiO2 photoanode
was assisted by low-lying mid-gap states. Electrically integrated
nanoparticles, with a small-channel mesoporous framework, facilitates
fast charge transport across the material. Furthermore, EIS has shown
that chemical capacitance, recombination resistance, and electron
lifetime were affected by hydrogenation, thus indicating an effect
on the photoanode material charge dynamics of DSSCs. An η of
7.2% under AM 1.5G illumination is obtained and an improvement by
75.6% over Degussa P25 titania. This is attributed to improved light
harvesting and charge collection by the meso-TiO2–X photoanode obtained via simple combustion synthesis.

Introduction
Energy needs for humanity
in the coming times due to economic growth
and rising population will increase.1 Conventional
energy sources are exhaustible and cause environmental pollution,
which are not suitable for the climate. Sunlight is an abundant and
sustainable power source2 and can be converted
to electric power via photovoltaics.3,4 Ever since
dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were reported by Grätzel
and co-workers in 1991, they have gathered attention throughout the
world because of their low cost and ease of preparation.5,6 DSSCs are composed of a dye-sensitized nanocrystalline film as a
photoanode, a redox couple in an electrolyte, and a platinized transparent
conducting oxide glass as a counter electrode.7 Here, the photoanode serves several essential functions such as
it provides surface for supporting dye molecules, provides medium
for transporting photoexcited electrons via a transparent conductive
oxide substrate into an external circuit, absorbs light, and allows
electrolyte diffusion and dye regeneration.8,9 To
reach the market and compete with conventional costly silicon solar
cells, understanding and improvement are needed in DSSCs.10

TiO2 along with few other metal
oxide semiconductors
has been used for various practical applications such as energy conversion
and storage, photocatalysis, sensing, electrochromic, and so forth.11,12 It is required to fabricate novel nanostructures with desired morphology,
crystallinity, composition, texture, and porosity for improved light
harvesting and charge transport.13−15 Of particular interest
are pseudo-three-dimensional (p3D) mesoporous materials, which provide
small diffusion length and have electrically connected particles with
high crystallinity for fast electron transport, thus making them a
good candidate for DSSCs, photocatalysis, and other light-harvesting
processes.16−19 In comparison, ordered mesoporous materials used for anode preparation
in DSSCs have a 20 nm pore wall and a long pore of several micrometers
in length, thus creating large diffusional constraint for charge transport.20,21 Hard and soft templates such as P123 and CTAB surfactants are needed
for synthesis and later have to be removed by calcination or other
methods.22 Further, photoelectrochemical
properties in TiO2 are controlled via doping a foreign
ion,23 band gap engineering,24 defect engineering,25 and so forth. Hydrogenation of titania is attracting interest because
of improved light absorption in TiO2, and much work has
been done in reducing TiO2.26 The density of oxygen vacancies results in higher charge carrier
density, enhancing electrical conductivity, as well as charge separation
and transportation, and also mid-gap electronic states improve the
optical absorption.27,28 Good repeatability is essential
in investigating the performance of each component; thus, it requires
great skill and know-how in DSSC fabrication, and nonetheless, it
does not need expensive equipment.29 These
integrated meso-TiO2–X anodes are
expected to simultaneously affect electro-optical and electron transport
features, thereby increasing photon-to-current conversion efficiency.

In this article, meso-TiO2–X is prepared via solution combustion synthesis with urea and titanium
nitrate in a 1:1 ratio at 400 °C and hydrogenation at different
pressures.30 During combustion, interconnected
nanocrystallites are generated in a self-propagating manner at high
temperature. Mesoporosity in the material is developed because of
evolved gases during combustion. New mid-gap states are introduced
and optimized in nanocrystallites via hydrogenation. By employing
these meso-TiO2–X anodes, 7.2%
η was obtained under simulated sunlight. This work is a part
of the research effort from the author to develop a photocatalyst
material suitable under sunlight for photovoltaics.

Results and Discussion
UV–visible absorption spectra of the as-prepared meso-TiO2–X have been measured, and the results
compared with T0 are shown in Figure 1. Pure T0 exhibits a well-defined wavelength absorption
cutoff edge at 400 nm. A continuous absorption spectrum beyond 400
nm with a poor absorption cutoff edge is observed for meso-TiO2–X. These new lower energy features
demonstrate the creation of mid-gap states via hydrogenation between
a conduction band and a valence band (VB), thus narrowing the band
gap with absorption extending into the visible region. Indeed, the
above-mentioned observation supports the conclusion that the oxygen
vacancy (Vo) and Ti3+ are far removed from the
O 2p VB and suggests the formation of the Vo-derived mid
gap in the forbidden gap of TiO2. The new band in the visible
region displays an intensity comparable to the band in the UV regime,
proposing the large density of states in the new band at higher hydrogenation
pressure. The hydrogenation has formed a shallow acceptor and a donor
level and decreases the band gap to 2.8 eV in meso-TiO2–X, depending on the pressure of reduction. The band
gap for meso-TiO2–X materials is
calculated using the Tauc plot from the diffusive reflectance UV–vis
spectroscopy analysis and is shown in the Supplementary Information Figure S1 and Table 1. The optical band gap values for T0, 10B, 20B, and
30B are 3.1, 3.1, 2.82, and 2.89 eV, respectively. The band gap decreased
to 2.82 eV for 20B, comparative to 3.1 eV for T0. Absorption in the
visible, near-infrared region of the spectrum due to defect introduction
can be seen as the white color for T0, light yellow for 10B, dark
brown for 20B, and gray color for 30B; digital images are shown as
the inset in Figure S1. Interestingly,
the rise in hydrogenation pressure displays lowering of difference
at absorption cutoff and extending into the visible and IR region.
Thus, larger fraction of photons in the solar spectrum is absorbed
and helps to generate an additional number of the charge carrier in
the meso-TiO2–X photoanode material.
It is to be noted that improved light harvesting by the materials
is necessary for increased solar cell efficiencies.

visible and near-IR region increases with increased pressure of hydrogenation.

Figure 2 shows transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images for 20B, T0, and 30B materials. Distorted
spherical nanocrystallites of 10–15 nm, electrically well-interconnected
with each other over long range, are observed.30,37 All other meso-TiO2–X materials
exhibit similar morphologies. TEM shows pseudo-3D porosity in meso-TiO2–X, and same morphologies were obtained
from different batches. Disordered (wormholelike) mesopores can be
seen in all the TEM images. It is likely that disordered mesoporosity
arises because of intergrowth of fundamental particles, and the same
leads to aggregates with significant extra framework void space. During
solution combustion, ammonia released via urea decomposition passes
through the developing material crystallite, which is attributed to
the mesoporosity in the material. It is observed predominantly that
(101) faceted particles are observed with lattice fringes corresponding
to the (101) (d(101) = 0.352 nm) crystallographic
plane of an anatase phase. The selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) pattern was shown as an inset in the figure, diffraction spots
demonstrate the polycrystalline nature of the material, and (101)
facets are the predominant planes. Particles (60 nm) for 30B are observed,
as well as an increase in the particle size with hydrogenation, supporting
X-ray diffraction (XRD) results. Field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM) images were taken to understand the morphology
of meso-TiO2–X material films.
FESEM images for T0 and 10B are represented in the Supplementary Information Figure S2a,b. High porosity is observed
in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images for materials because
of the release of combustion gases during material synthesis. The
3D disordered mesoporous framework of these meso-TiO2–X materials reduces the diffusional barriers and facilitates
mass transport through them, which makes them attractive in the photoanode
in DSSCs. Disordered mesoporous materials have small pore depths of
few nanometers unlike ordered mesoporous materials such as SBA-15
and MCM-41 having long pore channels of few micrometers and create
diffusional constraint for the electrolyte movement.18,19

To understand the surface electronic nature of meso-TiO2–X materials, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS)
studies are carried out. The XPS spectrum for the core-level Ti 2p
is shown in Figure 3. The binding energy (BE) for the Ti 2p3/2 core level
in 20B is observed at 458.1 eV, whereas BEs are observed at 458.4
eV and 458.8 eV for 30B and 10B or 459.2 eV for P25 (Figure 3a). This BE value demonstrates
that 20B differs electronically from other meso-TiO2–X materials. A significant decrease in the BE of Ti
2p3/2 in 20B shows that there is an increase in electron
density around Ti. The peak in lower BE indicates the presence of
lower valence states of Ti, and the core-level Ti3+ 2p3/2 appears at 457 eV as reported in the literature.38 The O 1s core level also displays similar changes.
20B exhibits the O 1s peak at 529.4 eV, in contrast to 530.3 eV for
T0 (Figure 3b). It
can be correlated to two factors. Mainly due to the reduction of the
lattice with Ti3+ formation in 20B than in 30B and 10B,
due to electrically interconnected nanoparticles (EINPs) and textural
properties leads to higher electron density on the surface. Under
hydrogenation, systematic removal of oxygen from the lattice to maintain
charge neutrality leads to increased electron density on the neighboring
oxygen atoms in the lattice. Thus, the above factors improved effective
electron density and increased electron transport between particles
in the mesoporous framework of 20B.

Figure 3 XPS spectra obtained for (a) Ti 2p and
(b) O 1s core levels of
meso-TiO2–X materials and the parent
TiO2 material. A clear increase in the electron density
on 20B is evident from the above results.

Figure 4 shows
powder
XRD (PXRD) pattern of the meso-TiO2–X materials. Structural properties calculated from the XRD pattern
for meso-TiO2–X are listed in Table 1 and compared with
Degussa P25. The diffraction patterns are indexed to JCPDS ICDD #
21-1272 for the anatase phase of TiO2 for 20B, 30B, 10B,
and T0.18,19 The peak intensity of 101 facets is the
highest, and thus, they are the most abundant planes in the material.
Additional features are observed as indexed to JCPDS ICDD # 21-1276,
corresponding to the rutile phase in 30B. New crystalline rutile phase
peaks are sharp and narrow. The 110 peak of the rutile phase is used
for calculating the rutile content in 30B. The broad nature of peaks
indicates the nanocrystalline nature of the particles. Particle sizes
are calculated from XRD data using the Debye–Scherrer equation,
and the same are listed in Table 1. It is to be noted that 20B exhibits a small particle
size (10.8 nm) with high crystallinity and mesoporosity. 30B exhibits
the crystalline anatase phase particle with 33.2 nm size, whereas
the rutile phase has particles with a size of 70.8 nm.

Figure 4 Wide-angle PXRD patterns
of meso-TiO2–X materials at different
hydrogenation pressures. 30B exhibits
mainly the rutile content and η of 1.7%, whereas other three
materials exhibit more than 5.0% η.

Textural properties of materials were examined via N2 physisorption studies. Measured N2 adsorption
and desorption
isotherms and pore size distribution for meso-TiO2–X are shown in the Supplementary Information (Figure S3a,b), while calculated values are mentioned
in Table 1. The meso-TiO2–X materials exhibit the type IV isotherm
with an H2 hysteresis loop which is a characteristic of the mesoporous
materials.37 T0 exhibits a surface area
of 154 m2/g which is the highest among meso-TiO2–X materials. With the increase in hydrogenation, the
pressure surface area decreased. The pore size increased with hydrogenation.
20B exhibits the highest pore diameter of 3.6 nm. A trade-off has
to be made between defect density and textural properties so that
the overall efficiency by meso-TiO2–X is high.

The current density–voltage (J–V) curves under AM 1.5 illumination
for the DSSC with meso-TiO2–X photoanode
material and Degussa
P25 are shown in Figure 5. Photovoltaic features such as short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (η) were
calculated from J–V studies and are given
in Table 2. The DSSC
with the 20B photoanode exhibits 7.2% efficiency. Higher efficiency
is attributed to improved charge carrier density or optical absorption
because of band gap reduction due to the formation of Ti3+ species in the meso-TiO2–X material.
In addition, electrically interconnected particles lead to fast charge
conduction in 20B, generating higher Jsc of 16.6 mA/cm2 and 0.69 V Voc with 67% FF. The small pore depth in a disordered mesoporous framework
with preferentially (101) facets leads to fast charge transport across
20B, thus increasing η. The lower density of mid-gap states
in 10B leads to η of 5.8%. Because of the absence of optical
and electrical features, with mere textural features in the parent
mesoporous (T0)-based device exhibited η of 5.0%. 20B exhibits
75.6% improvement in η over P25 titania. Improved light harvesting
is attributed to higher charge carrier density and minimized recombination
across the 20B structure. In fact, new species improved conductivity,
affecting electron lifetimes. High surface area and small pore depth
provide easy access to the electrolyte for regeneration at the interface.
Improved optical, electrical, and structural features allow higher
density and fast transport across the material, enhancing charge transfer
and electrolyte regeneration, yielding better DSSC parameters. In
contrast, the 30B material shows η of 1.7%, a 58.5% decrease
in η compared to P25, underscoring the necessity of textural
characteristics for various functions such as dye absorption, charge
diffusion, and electrolyte regeneration for next cycle. With bigger
30B particles and less surface area for dye anchoring, poor electrical
connectivity between particles results in solar cells with reduced
efficiency. Primarily, the rutile phase (80%) in 30B shows high recombination;
P25 having a 70% anatase content is responsible for η of 4.1%.
The suitable phase alignment for the unidirectional charge transfer
and the interface structure to minimize interface charge trap states.
The presence of the anatase–rutile phase junction in 20B and
P25 leads to efficient charge separation and transport across the
interface.39

Electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) is a useful technique
for studying electron transport and charge recombination across the
interfaces in a DSSC.40 EIS results as
Nyquist plots are shown in Figure 6 for DSSCs. The physical interpretation of the device
is done by fitting the EIS plot in terms of the resistor–capacitor
circuit and measured values are marked in Table 2. A typical Nyquist plot for DSSCs consists
of three arcs. The response at the high-frequency range (500 000–1000
Hz) is attributed to the charge-transfer process at the electrolyte/Pt
interface. The mid-frequency range between 1000 and 1 Hz represents
the charge-transfer process at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte
interface. In the low-frequency region of 1–0.0002 Hz, the
arc represents the mass transport resistance of ions in the electrolyte.
Generally, the high- and low-frequency arcs are not easily distinguishable
and appear as a deformation of the central arc. The chemical capacitance
(Cμ) as obtained from fitting the
central arc helps in describing the fundamental mechanism whereby
photogenerated carriers store free energy and produce a voltage and
current in the external circuit.41Cμ values of 20.4, 42.8, 59.0, 90.4, and
18.7 μF for P25, T0, 10B, 20B, and 30B are observed, respectively.
20B exhibits the highest Cμ value.
Additional density of mid-gap states is available to accept more charges
accessible with the high specific area. This indicates that 20B has
produced high donor density in the framework, resulting in high Jsc. Oxygen vacancy (Vo) is generated
in 20B under reducing conditions. The Vo plays an important
role in determining the surface and electronic properties of meso-TiO2–X.27,28 The density
of Vo results in enhanced electrical conductivity, separation,
and transportation. 20B possesses long-range electrically interconnected
nanocrystalline particles in the disordered mesoporous framework ensuing
improved conductivity. Reduced Cμ values for 30B suggest poor dye loading. Charge separation relies
on good connectivity into each of the macroscopic plates, thus depending
on the specific surface area of the interface. Increase in the particle
size limits charge transfer. Recombination resistance (Rct) is also calculated, which describes the charge-transfer
resistance across the interface.42Rct values for P25, T0, 10B, 20B, and 30B are
6.2, 5.0, 5.8, 1.9, and 3.2 Ω, respectively. 20B exhibits an Rct of 1.9 Ω, a 69.3% lesser resistance
in comparison to that of P25 titania. The photoexcited dye can undergo
facile charge transfer to the new states of TiO2. Good
transfer kinetics leads to improvement in device output. Strong dye
anchoring on preferential (101) facets of meso-TiO2–X controls the limiting charge recombination process
in the dye. Bode plots for DSSCs were obtained from the EIS data,
and the plots are presented in the Supplementary Information, Figure S4. Effective electron lifetimes (τn) were calculated using eq 1, and the results are summarized in Table 2, where fm is the frequency at the maximum in the mid-frequency arc
of the Bode plot.43 1  

Figure 6 Electrochemical
impedance spectra (Nyquist plot) for DSSCs based
on meso-TiO2–X photoanode materials
and P25 at Voc, 100 mW/cm2.
The equivalent circuit model of the DSSCs is shown as the inset.

In the Bode plot, the peak in
mid-frequency shifts to lower values.
It is observed that lifetime is significantly higher for 20B (14.7
ms) than for 10B and 30B. Higher effective diffusion length due to
suppressed recombination and fast charge transport affects charge
collection efficiency. The higher recombination rate in P25 results
in short lifetimes.

Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency
(IPCE) for DSSC
devices prepared with meso-TiO2–X photoanodes was recorded as a function of the excitation wavelength
and is represented in Figure 7.44 In the long-wavelength region
(600–780 nm) in which the N719 dye has a low absorption for
incident light, the higher IPCE values of the 20B meso-TiO2–X electrodes could be ascribed to the enhanced light
absorption capacities of the film. Fast electron injection from the
dye to the anode and reduced charge recombination over T0 are observed.
A similar minor improvement is observed for 10B and 30B. The IPCE
values for meso-TiO2–X are in agreement
with the variation of Jsc observed in J–V studies. 20B achieved 58% conversion, a 67% improvement
over T0 at 530 nm, and 35% for 10B while IPCE decreased for 30B by
47%. New electronic states and EINP with the mesoporous framework
improved charge density and charge utilization in 20B. Although 30B
exhibits a good absorption spectrum, the lowest IPCE is due to low
dye adsorption and charge transport across the material because of
the poor surface area.

Figure 7 IPCE data for the DSSC made with meso-TiO2–X photoanode materials and TiO2.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
outlined a successful strategy for integrating
electronic, optical, and structural features in the photoanode for
DSSCs. The maximum η is found in the 20B sample, a 7.2% power
conversion efficiency under sunlight and corresponds to a 45.6% improvement
over Degussa P25 titania. The enhancement in DSSC performance in the
meso-TiO2–X samples over TiO2 samples is attributed to the higher visible light absorption,
resulting in an increase in the charge carrier density in DSSCs. The
meso-TiO2–X photoanodes with new
states generated by hydrogenation exhibit improved electron mobility.
Also, fast electron transport is exhibited in EINP with high crystallinity,
with preferentially (101) TiO2 facets in the small pore
depth mesoporous framework. Improved DSSC efficiency in meso-TiO2–X is due to ease in electrolyte regeneration
via the large interface. This report shows facile integration of various
anode features for the enhancement of DSSC efficiency. These meso-TiO2–X materials having good visible light
absorption and low charge recombination are expected to be a worthy
candidate for photocatalytic applications.31,32 Improvement in the photoanode parameters, that is, fast charge transport
and good optical absorption via band gap reduction by means of various
synthetic strategies and light-harvesting protocols, are in progress
for similar photocatalytic applications.

Experimental Methods
Synthesis
of Meso-TiO2–X Materials
All the chemicals employed were of analytical grade and used as
such without any further purification. Titanium nitrate (Sigma-Aldrich)
as the Ti precursor as well as oxidizer and urea (Merck) as fuels
were used. Urea–metal ratios were kept at 1:1. Solution combustion
synthesis requires no hard or soft template molecules for structure
direction, as in ordered mesoporous materials.18,19 The required amounts of aqueous titanium nitrate and urea were placed
in a 250 mL beaker and introduced into a muffle furnace maintained
at 400 °C. Water evaporates in the first few minutes followed
by smoldering type combustion that occurs for less than a minute.
Solid products were obtained within 10 min of total preparation time
and are named as T0. The T0 catalyst was reduced to obtain 10B, 20B,
and 30B materials at 10, 20, and 30 bar hydrogen pressures, respectively,
at 200 °C for 10 h in a high-pressure reactor. To study the effect
of different hydrogen pressures on the material, the temperature is
kept at a minimum of 200 °C.

Characterization of Materials
Diffuse reflectance UV–visible
measurements were performed on a Shimadzu 2600 spectrophotometer with
an empty sphere setup. Spectral grade BaSO4 was used as
a reference material.31,32 XPS measurements were performed
in an ambient pressure photoelectron spectrometer (APPES from Prevac,
Poland) under UHV conditions. XPS measurements were made with an Mg
K X-ray source for X-ray generation and an R3000HP (VG Scienta) analyzer
for energy analysis.33,34 PXRD data of meso-TiO2–X materials were collected from a PANalytical X’pert
Pro dual goniometer diffractometer. The data were collected with a
step size of 0.02° and a scan rate of 0.5°/min. The sample
was spun slowly throughout the scan for better counting statistics.
The radiation used was Cu Kα (1.5418 Å) with an Ni filter,
and the data collection was carried out using a sample holder in Bragg–Brentano
geometry. A FEI Nova NanoSEM 430 field emission scanning electron
microscope was used for SEM measurements of materials. The field emission
gun was operated at 20 kV potential. Thin films were prepared on fluorine-doped
tin oxide (FTO) and placed on the stage for studies. A FEI TECNAI
3010 electron microscope operating at 300 kV (Cs = 0.6 mm, resolution 1.7 Å) was used for recording HRTEM
images of all materials. Samples were crushed and dispersed in isopropanol
before depositing onto a holey carbon grid.34 Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms for the materials
were collected from a quantachrome autosorb automated gas sorption
system (NOVA 1200). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller equation
was used to calculate the surface area from the adsorption branch.
The pore size distribution was calculated using the Barrett–Joyner–Hollenda
method on the desorption curve of the isotherm.

Fabrication
of Solar Cell Devices
TiO2 paste
was prepared by the following method described by Ito et al. in the
literature.35 TiO2 powder was
mixed with α-terpineol and ethylcellulose in the ratio of 16.8:4.5:78.7.
TiO2 thin films were prepared by applying the paste on
the FTO glass plate using the doctor blade method.36 The TiO2 electrodes were gradually heated under
an air flow at 500 °C for 15 min. The working electrode was composed
of a 12–13 μm thick TiO2 film (active area
0.16 cm2). The dye was absorbed on a TiO2 film
by dipping into 0.5 mM N719 dye solution in ethanol at room temperature
for 20 h to complete the loading with a sensitizer. The dye-adsorbed
TiO2 electrode and Pt-deposited glass counter electrode
were assembled together into a sealed sandwich-type cell by clips.
A drop of electrolyte solution containing 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium
iodide, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile was injected into the assembled cell.

Photovoltaic Measurements
J–V characteristics of assembled DSSCs were measured under
AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW/cm2) with a 100 W xenon lamp
from a class AAA solar simulator, SS30AAA-TP (Photo Emission Tech.
Inc.) over an active photoanode area of 0.16 cm2. The photocurrent
generated from the device was measured using a Keithley 2400 source
meter. J–V measurement assembly was calibrated
using a reference silicon diode cell (NREL certified). IPCE spectra
were recorded on a QEPVSI-b (Newport) quantum efficiency measurement
system by changing the excitation wavelength at an interval of 10
nm over the range of 350–800 nm. The incident monochromatic
light was chopped at a frequency of 20 Hz, and a bias light of 0.1
sun was provided during measurements. The generated photocurrent is
measured on a Keithley 2400 source meter. IPCE measurement systems
were calibrated with respect to a reference silicon solar cell (without
bias illumination). EIS measurements were performed on an SP-300 potentiostat
(Bio-Logic Science Instruments) in the frequency range of 100 mHz
