We
report syntheses, crystal and electronic structures, and characterization
of three new hybrid organic–inorganic halides (R)ZnBr3(DMSO), (R)2CdBr4·DMSO, and (R)CdI3(DMSO) (where (R) = C6(CH3)5CH2N(CH3)3, and DMSO = dimethyl
sulfoxide). The compounds can be conveniently prepared as single crystals
and bulk polycrystalline powders using a DMSO–methanol solvent
system. On the basis of the single-crystal X-ray diffraction results
carried out at room temperature and 100 K, all compounds have zero-dimensional
(0D) crystal structures featuring alternating layers of bulky organic
cations and molecular inorganic anions based on a tetrahedral coordination
around group 12 metal cations. The presence of discrete molecular
building blocks in the 0D structures results in localized charges
and tunable room-temperature light emission, including white light
for (R)ZnBr3(DMSO), bluish-white light for (R)2CdBr4·DMSO, and green for (R)CdI3(DMSO).
The highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) value of 3.07%
was measured for (R)ZnBr3(DMSO), which emits cold white
light based on the calculated correlated color temperature (CCT) of
11,044 K. All compounds exhibit fast photoluminescence lifetimes on
the timescale of tens of nanoseconds, consistent with the fast luminescence
decay observed in π-conjugated organic molecules. Temperature
dependence photoluminescence study showed the appearance of additional
peaks around 550 nm, resulting from the organic salt emission. Density
functional theory calculations show that the incorporation of both
the low-gap aromatic molecule R and the relatively electropositive
Zn and Cd metals can lead to exciton localization at the aromatic
molecular cations, which act as luminescence centers.

==== Body
I Introduction
Solution-processable
hybrid organic–inorganic halides have
been at the forefront of optical and electronic materials research
in the past decade, owing to their rich crystal chemistry and broadly
tunable physical properties.1−6 Among these, Pb- and Sn-based hybrid halide perovskites have been
the focus of global attention because of their excellent performance
in solar cells, which now have record power conversion efficiencies
exceeding 22%.7 In addition, excellent
light emission properties of halide perovskites have also been reported,
including efficient blue emission8,9 and broadband
white light emission.10−15 Inspired by these findings, further experimental studies show that
nonperovskite hybrid organic–inorganic halides can also have
remarkable light emission properties, such as in the case of (H2DABCO)Pb2Cl6 and (H3O)(Et2-DABCO)8Pb21Cl59 compounds
that demonstrate white light emission with high color rendering index
(CRI) values of 96 and 88, respectively.16

The light emission properties of hybrid organic–inorganic
perovskites are strongly dependent on their structural dimensionality,
with 3D perovskites behaving as typical all-inorganic multinary halides
with small exciton binding energies (typically below 50 meV).1,17,18 Conversely, low-dimensional hybrid
halides demonstrate much stronger charge localization and exciton
binding energies in excess of 500 meV, values that are comparable
to those of tightly bound Frenkel excitons in organic materials.1,19 Such high exciton binding energies can accordingly result in room-temperature
stable excitons and intense excitonic emission. Therefore, preparation
and characterization of low-dimensional organic–inorganic hybrid
halides for light emission applications have been the focus of several
studies published in recent years.20−22

Highest charge
localization and exciton binding energies are often
observed in zero-dimensional (0D) compounds,6 which feature molecular inorganic anions and organic cations in
their crystal structures. Indeed, numerous Cu-, Sn-, and Sb-based
0D nonperovskite hybrid halides have recently been reported to exhibit
remarkable light emission properties, including photoluminescence
quantum yields (PLQY) approaching unity22−25 and large Stokes shifts above
300 nm.26 The large Stokes shifts are primarily
attributed to the pronounced excited-state structural distortions23,26 and, therefore, are rarely observed for materials in the solid state
because of the rigidity of solid structures, which restricts significant
structural reorganization. However, 0D hybrid halides featuring molecular
organic and inorganic units are more amenable to structural reorganization
and hence exhibit broadband photoluminescence (PL) spectra with large
Stokes shifts.

Unlike the Pb- and Sn-based hybrid halides, the
optical and electronic
properties of the hybrid halides of group 12 metals remain largely
unexplored. Notwithstanding a few recent publications focusing on
the light emission properties of group 12 metal hybrid halides,19,20,27 most published articles focus
on their intriguing structural properties, including structural dimensionalities,
impact of hydrogen bonding, molecular orientations of organic cations,
etc.28−30 These group 12 metal-based hybrid halides show a
remarkable structural flexibility in their tunable dimensionality19,27 and incorporation of functional organic cations, such as chromophores
and polymers,30,31 in 2D perovskite structures,
both of which can be utilized to prepare functional materials for
practical applications, including solid-state lighting applications.
This fact is further evidenced by a recent discovery of broadband
white light emission in the 2D-layered perovskite compound (C6H11NH3)2CdBr4 originating
from both organic and inorganic layers.20

In this work, we report the use of the previously reported
organic
trimethyl(2,3,4,5,6-pentamethylbenzyl)ammonium (denoted as (R) hereafter)
halides32 to prepare luminescent 0D hybrid
(R)-M-X halides, where M = Zn or Cd, and X = Br or I. Single crystals
of three new compounds within the studied systems were obtained using
low-temperature solution reactions. On the basis of our X-ray crystallography
work, all compounds form 0D crystal structures featuring alternating
layers of organic cations and inorganic anions that are based on tetrahedral
coordination around metal cations. In (R)ZnBr3(DMSO) and
(R)CdI3(DMSO), DMSO molecules directly coordinate to metal
cations through M–O bonds yielding MX3DMSO– units, whereas (R)2CdBr4·DMSO features
CdBr42– anions and DMSO molecules that
act as spacers in between organic and inorganic ions. No structural
phase transitions are observed between room temperature and 100 K.
The optical properties were investigated using steady-state PL as
a function of temperature, photoluminescence excitation (PLE), time-resolved
photoluminescence (TRPL), PLQY, and density functional theory (DFT).
The compounds are shown to demonstrate rare light emission from the
organic component of the hybrid organic–inorganic halides,
including deep blue emission and broadband white light emission with
PLQY values up to 3.07%.

II Results and Discussion
Crystal
Structures
Room-temperature and low-temperature
single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD) experiments for hybrid bromide
and iodides of Zn and Cd metals are summarized in Figure 1, Table 1, and Tables S1–S3. On the basis of the obtained results, there are no structural transitions
between room temperature and 100 K for all reported compounds; instead,
normal contraction of the unit cell volume is observed upon cooling
(Table 1 and Table S1). As expected, the use of bulky nonlinear
organic cation results in 0D crystal structures for (R)ZnBr3(DMSO), (R)2CdBr4·DMSO, and (R)CdI3(DMSO) featuring alternating layers of isolated inorganic
anions and organic cations. In all cases, DMSO solvent molecules are
incorporated into the crystal structures of the resultant compounds.
In the case of (R)2CdBr4·DMSO, the coordination
environment around Cd2+ only consists of bromide anions
yielding CdBr42– anions and DMSO molecules
acting as spacers in between organic and inorganic ions. However,
in (R)ZnBr3(DMSO) and (R)CdI3(DMSO), DMSO molecules
and halide anions form the coordination environment around metal cations
through direct M–O bonds yielding MX3DMSO– units (Figure 1).
Notice that the formula for (R)2CdBr4·DMSO
is written differently compared to (R)ZnBr3(DMSO) and (R)CdI3(DMSO) to emphasize the direct coordination of DMSO molecules
to the metals in the latter. The measured M–O bond distances
of dZn–O = 2.024(5) Å and dCd–O = 2.247(7) Å in (R)ZnBr3(DMSO) and (R)CdI3(DMSO) (Table S2), respectively, follow the expected trend based on the sizes
of Zn2+ and Cd2+ ions.33 These values are slightly longer than the literature-reported Zn–O
and Cd–O bond distances in oxyhalides such as Zn0.902SbBrO2 (dZn–O = 1.897
Å) and BiCdIO2 (dCd/Bi–O = 2.239 Å).34 On the other hand,
the metal halide bond distances are in the dZn–Br = 2.38–2.40 Å range for (R)ZnBr3(DMSO), dCd–Br = 2.58–2.61
Å for (R)2CdBr4·DMSO, and dCd–I = 2.72–2.73 Å for (R)CdI3(DMSO). These values compare well with those reported for
other hybrid organic–inorganic halides of Zn and Cd, including
[4,4′-H2bipy][ZnBr4] (dZn–Br = 2.39–2.43 Å),29 (CH3NH3)2CdBr4 (dCd–Br = 2.57–2.59 Å),
and (CH3NH3)2CdI4 (dCd–I = 2.72–2.75 Å).19 In all compounds, the tetrahedral coordination
around the metal cations are distorted, with bond angles ranging from
98.97(19)° to 118.37(3)° in (R)CdI3(DMSO) (Table S2). It should be noted that the presence
of DMSO in the coordination sphere of Cd2+ undoubtedly
contributes to the observed distortion in (R)CdI3(DMSO);
however, tetrahedral distortions are also observed for cadmium halides
with no coordinating solvent molecules including (R)2CdBr4·DMSO, which features CdBr42– units, and in literature, for (CH3NH3)2CdBr4 and (CH3NH3)2CdI4.19

Stability Studies
On the basis of
the results of our
powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements, all compounds form phase-pure
products (Figure 2).
The PXRD patterns in all cases have several characteristic low angle
peaks, indicative of large unit cell parameters stemming from the
use of the bulky organic cation. Poor stability in air is an often-cited
deficiency of some of the most well-known hybrid organic–inorganic
halides, including the state-of-the-art photovoltaic material CH3NH3PbI3.35,36 To test the
air stability of our compounds, powdered samples were allowed to sit
undisturbed under ambient conditions over a period of 1 month. Periodic
PXRD scans taken on the samples exposed to ambient air (Figure S5) indicate that all samples are stable
for at least several days. Noticeable changes are recorded for (R)CdI3(DMSO), which shows lowered peak intensities and peak broadening
after 2 weeks (Figure S5), indicative of
reduced crystallinity. These results are consistent with the trend
we recently observed for the (CH3NH3)2CdX4 (X = Cl, Br, or I) series, in which air stability
is markedly worse for the iodide compared to the chloride analogue.19 Furthermore, extensive studies on halide perovskites
also suggest reduced air stabilities going from chlorides to iodides.36

Optical Properties
The highly tunable
light emission
properties in this series studied through room-temperature optical
absorption, PL, and PLE measurements are summarized in Figure 3 and Table 2. Optical absorption spectra show a sharp
absorption peak at ∼290 nm, accompanied with a shoulder at
315, 320, and 360 nm for (R)ZnBr3(DMSO), (R)2CdBr4·DMSO, and (R)CdI3(DMSO), respectively.
These optical absorption bands were attributed to the organic molecule.
Moreover, PLE spectra show the presence of a sharp peak at 386, 399,
and 445 nm for (R)ZnBr3(DMSO), (R)2CdBr4·DMSO, and (R)CdI3(DMSO), respectively. These
peaks were assigned to the excitonic absorption.37 Similar to the earlier reports on Cd- and Pb-based hybrid
halide perovskites,12,19−21,38−40 all compounds studied in this
work exhibit broadband emission spectra with full width at half maximum
(FWHM) values ranging from 162 nm for (R)CdI3(DMSO) to
188 nm for (R)ZnBr3(DMSO). Importantly, bright broadband
white light emission is observed for (R)ZnBr3(DMSO). The
corresponding Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE)
color coordinates (x, y) of (0.26,
0.30) for (R)ZnBr3(DMSO) are close to the white point (0.33,
0.33) coordinates. (R)2CdBr4·DMSO emits
bluish-white light with CIE coordinates of (0.24, 0.35), whereas (R)CdI3(DMSO) emits green light (0.29, 0.57). For the compounds with
emission on the Planckian locus, the calculated correlated color temperatures
(CCT) using the approach proposed by Hernández-Andrés
et al.41 are 11044 K for (R)ZnBr3(DMSO) and 10384 K for (R)2CdBr4·DMSO.41 Such high values suggest that these compounds
emit “cool” bluish-white and white colors similar to
the cold white light-emitting Pb-based halide perovskites.39

The room-temperature PL lifetime profiles of the compounds
prepared
in this work are plotted in Figure 4. All the profiles monitoring the emission at the wavelength
of maximum intensity can be well fitted by two-exponential functions.
The first lifetime component of 1–2 ns for all compounds is
due to the instrumental response because of the duration of the light
pulse (2 ns). The measured PL lifetimes of these compounds range from
9 to 21.1 ns (Figure 4). In the literature, a spread in PL lifetimes of Pb-based hybrid
halides is reportedly ranging from subnanoseconds up to 54.1 ns,16,21,39 attributed to self-trapped excitonic
states (STEs), and for some 0D Pb-free hybrid halides, phosphorescence
lifetimes in microseconds are reported.23,26,42

and the derived lifetime constants.

In hybrid metal halide perovskites, tunable broadband emission
has been attributed to structural distortions, particularly to the
distortions of the inorganic MX6 octahedra.12,20,43 According to these studies, structural
distortions directly impact band gaps and the spread in the structural
distortions, therefore broadening the emission spectra. Although the
compounds studied in this work are not perovskites and are not based
on octahedral inorganic frameworks, tetrahedral distortions around
metal cations are clearly evident for each compound (Table S2). However, in the present case, we cannot establish
a clear correlation between tetrahedral distortions and the measured
FWHM values because of the differing crystal structures and coordination
environments around the metal cations in this family. Nevertheless,
the structural distortions observed in our compounds could, in principle,
aid in the generation of more transient photoexcited STEs similar
to those in Pb halide perovskites.39,44,45 For 0D hybrid halides of Sn and Sb, it has been shown
that the significant structural distortions of the excited state also
lead to large Stokes shifts of 200–350 nm.23,26 Although we observe smaller Stokes shifts ranging from 70 nm for
(R)CdI3(DMSO) to 105 nm for (R)ZnBr3(DMSO),
these values are still much higher than those for higher dimensional
(2D and 3D) hybrid halide perovskites.46 The impact of distortions of the inorganic anions would be greatest
if light emission originates from the inorganic molecules, that is,
if the excitons are localized on the inorganic units. Unlike the heavily
studied Sn and Pb halide systems, in the present case, we employed
group 12 metals (Zn and Cd), which have lower electronegativities47 and, hence, higher lying conduction bands for
the inorganic anions. Consequently, excitons in (R)ZnBr3(DMSO), (R)2CdBr4·DMSO, and (R)CdI3(DMSO) could be localized on the organic molecules, and the
relatively smaller Stokes shifts in our compounds (between 70 and
105 nm) could be a direct consequence of this fact. Recently, broadband
white light emission in the 2D-layered perovskite compound (C6H11NH3)2CdBr4 was
reported and attributed to both organic and inorganic layers emissions.20 Another recent report of yellowish-white light
emission in the 1D hybrid perovskite (C9H10N2)PbCl4 attributed its emission properties to a
resonant energy transfer mechanism from the inorganic PbCl4 to the organic molecules.40 To further
study the origin of the broadband light emission in our compounds,
we have also carried out PL and PLE measurements on the precursor
organic salts (R)Br and (R)I, which are provided in Figure 5. The corresponding binary
inorganic halides do not luminesce at room temperature because of
thermal quenching effects.19,42,48−51 As shown in Table 2, (R)Br emits a light blue color with CIE coordinates of (0.21, 0.29),
whereas (R)I emits a light green color with CIE coordinates of (0.23,
0.48). Importantly, the PL and PLE spectra of (R)ZnBr3(DMSO),
(R)2CdBr4·DMSO, and (R)CdI3(DMSO)
are largely similar to that of (R)Br and (R)I (Figure 5), suggesting that the emission in our hybrid
halides originates from the organic molecules. The red shift of the
PL peaks of the hybrid halides compared to the organic salts can be
attributed to the difference in the crystal structures of the precursor
organic salts and hybrid halides and the resultant higher charge localization
in hybrid halides.

Figure 5 (a, b) Room-temperature PLE (dashed lines) and PL spectra
(solid
lines) of the (a) (R)Br organic salt and (R)Br-based compounds and
(b) (R)I organic salt and (R)I-based compound. Spectra are normalized
for clarity.

The measured room-temperature
PLQY values range from 0.27% for
(R)CdI3(DMSO) to 3.07% for (R)ZnBr3(DMSO), which
are comparable or higher than most of the reported broadband light
emitters based on lead halide perovskites.10,21,52,53 The precursor
salts (R)Br and (R)I demonstrate PLQY values of 2.44 and 0.42%, respectively.
Therefore, the emission efficiency is increased upon incorporation
of the organic molecule into (R)ZnBr3(DMSO) but is decreased
in (R)2CdBr4·DMSO and (R)CdI3(DMSO). A direct comparison with PLQY values for other hybrid halides
of group 12 metals cannot be made because of the apparent lack of
in-depth investigations of their light emission properties. However,
our recent study on (CH3NH3)2CdX4 (X = Cl, Br, or I)19 reports that
these compounds do not luminesce at room temperature, which seems
to confirm the validity of the strategy of using bulky luminescent
organic cations to create 0D structures with molecular organic and
inorganic ions to prepare room-temperature luminescent hybrid halides,
as employed in this work.

To get further information about the
thermally activated processes
and the origin of the broadband emission, we measured the temperature
dependence PL spectra for two of the more stable compounds in this
family, (R)ZnBr3(DMSO) and (R)2CdBr4·DMSO, under a 325 nm laser excitation (Figure 6a,b). Significant temperature-dependent changes
were revealed. For both Zn- and Cd-based compounds, the room temperature
PL spectrum shows the presence of only one broadband, denoted as P1
and B1 in Figure 6a,b for (R)ZnBr3(DMSO) and (R)2CdBr4·DMSO, respectively. Upon cooling, additional PL peaks (denoted
as P2 for (R)ZnBr3(DMSO) and B2 for (R)2CdBr4·DMSO) emerge at around 550 nm. These peaks split into
multiple sub-bands below 200 K. The splitting of PL peaks is often
observed in organic–inorganic hybrid materials and may originate
from the presence of free and bi-excitons,54 free exciton and exciton-phonon interactions,55 or free and bound excitons5 or
could even result from the presence of structural phase transitions
often observed in these hybrid materials. The latter possibility is
ruled out in the present case by our room-temperature and 100 K SXRD
measurements, suggesting the absence of structural phase transitions
in the 100–300 K range.56−58 In the present case, very similar
thermal behavior was observed for (R)ZnBr3(DMSO) and for
(R)2CdBr4·DMSO, which suggests that the
appearance of additional low-temperature PL peaks could result from
the emission of the organic cation. On the basis of the temperature
dependence PL data shown in Figure 6b, we plotted the thermal dependence of the integrated
intensity, the FWHM, and the position of B1 PL band of (R)2CdBr4·DMSO in Figure 7. The quenching of the B1 peak could be described by
the following Arrhenius-type model55 1  where I0 is the low-temperature PL intensity, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, a is the ratio between the
radiative and the nonradiative
decay rates, and Ea is the activation
energy. The best fit of the experimental data presented in Figure 7a yields I0 = 9.2 × 104 ± 830, a = 76 ± 8, and Ea = 48
± 4 meV. This activation energy presents a good agreement with
those reported in similar organic–inorganic hybrid materials
such as (C6H11NH3)2PbBr412 and (C6H11NH3)2CdBr4.20 Moreover, the remarkable broadening of B1 PL peak as a function
of temperature (Figure 7b) can be attributed to exciton-phonon interaction described within
the following law59 2  where the first term represents
the natural line width at 0 K, the second term is the broadening induced
by acoustic phonons, and the third term corresponds to the contribution
of optical phonons to the peak broadening. The best fit parameters
yield Γ0 = 440 ± 38 meV, ΓAC = 0.76 ± 0.03 meV K–1, ΓLO = 22 ± 4 meV, and ELO = 16 ±
2 meV. Once again, these values are in good agreement with those reported
in organic–inorganic hybrid materials such as (C6H11NH3)2CdBr420 and those of the inorganic perovskite CsCdBr360 and CdBr2 crystals.61 On the other hand, the B1 PL peak of (R)2CdBr4·DMSO shows a continuous red shift as
a function of temperature (Figure 7c), which is usually the case for excitonic PL peaks
accompanied with a clear regime change around 150 K. This is attributed
to the impact of the appearance of the B2 PL peak at low temperature,
which may cause a competition in the recombination process between

First-Principle Calculations
Electronic band structure
calculations were performed to further investigate the optical properties
of the compounds prepared in this work. Figure 8 displays the electronic band structures
and DOS plots for (R)ZnBr3(DMSO), (R)2CdBr4·DMSO, and (R)CdI3(DMSO), which show the PBE-calculated
band gaps of 3.82, 3.61, and 3.39 eV, respectively. Although the PBE
band gaps are typically underestimated and do not take into account
the exciton binding energies, the trend of the calculated band gaps
is consistent with that of the exciton excitation energies, which
are 3.21 eV for (R)ZnBr3(DMSO), 3.11 eV for (R)2CdBr4·DMSO, and 2.79 eV for (R)CdI3(DMSO).
All three compounds show small dispersion for the electronic bands
near the band gap, indicating that these bands are made up of highly
localized electronic states. The band gaps of these compounds are
slightly indirect. The valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction
band minimum (CBM) are located at the Γ and Y points, respectively,
for (R)ZnBr3(DMSO), at the N and the Γ points for
(R)2CdBr4·DMSO, and at the Z and the Γ
points for (R)CdI3(DMSO). In luminescent 0D hybrid Sn-
and Pb-based halides, the inorganic Sn/Pb halide clusters are usually
the luminescent centers because of their relatively small energy gaps
of the inorganic substructures compared to those of organic molecules.23,26,62 The low energy gaps of the inorganic
substructures in such cases are ensured by the relatively small electronegativity
difference between Sn/Pb and halogen elements, which results in valence
bands being dominated by halogen orbitals and conduction bands being
primarily made up of metal orbitals. In principle, the band alignment
in hybrid halides can be altered by (1) combining pairs of metal and
halogen elements with large electronegativity difference to accommodate
the organic molecules’ frontier orbitals or (2) by utilizing
low-gap aromatic molecular cations. The hybrid metal halides studied
in this work feature electropositive metals Zn and Cd36 and an aromatic organic cation, yielding unusual band alignments
at the organic–inorganic interface.1 The DOS plots in Figure 8 show that (R)ZnBr3(DMSO) exhibits the type I band
alignment with its VBM and CBM derived from the bonding and the antibonding
π orbitals of the aromatic molecule cations, whereas (R)2CdBr4·DMSO and (R)CdI3(DMSO) display
the type II band alignment with the VBM and the CBM containing π
orbitals of the organic cations and the metal s orbitals of the inorganic
anions, respectively. It is thus expected that the optical emission
from (R)ZnBr3(DMSO) is due to the excitons localized on
the organic molecular cations. Although the ground-state band structures
of (R)2CdBr4·DMSO and (R)CdI3(DMSO) show the type II band alignment, the lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital of the molecular cation is close to the CBM, as shown in Figure 8d,f. The strong Coulomb
binding could localize the exciton at the organic cation, in analogy
to the case of (Ph4P)2SbCl5, in which
the exciton is localized at the SbCl5 cluster despite the
ground-state band structure showing the type II band alignment at
the organic-inorganic interface.23 The
fast decay of the luminescence in the three hybrid metal halides,
as shown in Figure 4 (9–21 ns), is consistent with the fast emission from the
π-conjugated organic molecules (decay times ranging from a few
nanoseconds to a few tens of nanoseconds),63 thus supporting the attribution of the exciton emission in these
hybrid halides to the organic molecules. In comparison, an exciton
that is localized at the inorganic metal halide cluster in hybrid
metal halides usually has the lifetime on the order of microseconds.23,26,64Figure 9 shows the hole and the electron wavefunctions
of an exciton in (R)ZnBr3(DMSO), which is optimized by
the PBE0 hybrid functional calculation. It can be seen that the exciton
is indeed localized on the π orbitals of the C6 ring
in a molecular cation, which, thus, should act as a luminescent center.

III Conclusions
In
summary, we report the preparation, crystal and electronic structures,
and optical properties of three new hybrid organic–inorganic
halides of group 12 metals. Because of the presence of the bulky organic
(R)+ cation, all compounds form 0D crystal structures featuring
alternating layers of isolated inorganic anions based on metal tetrahedra
and organic cations. The separation of the crystal structure into
distinct inorganic and organic molecular units leads to flat bands
near the band gap, indicative of the highly localized electronic states.
Furthermore, the 0D molecular structures allow for the localization
of the excitons on either anionic or cationic molecular units, depending
on their chemistries. Thus, on the basis of our computational work,
the excitons are localized on the organic molecular cation in (R)ZnBr3(DMSO), suggesting a rare example of light emission from the
organic component of hybrid organic–inorganic materials.6,12,21,65 The computational results are supported by the PL measurements,
including the measured fast decay of the luminescence (9–21
ns), which is consistent with the fast emission from the π-conjugated
organic molecules.

The compounds exhibit broadband emission
ranging from bluish-white
to white to green light, depending on the choice of the halide and
metal cations. The luminescence properties derive from the intricacies
of their crystal and electronic structures (e.g., packing of the organic
cations). Temperature dependence of PL measurements showed the emergence
of additional peaks around 550 nm at lower temperatures, attributed
to the organic salt emission. For (R)2CdBr4·DMSO,
an excitonic activation energy Ea ≈
50 meV was estimated from the thermal dependence of the intensity
of B1 PL peak, showing a good agreement with Cd-based organic–inorganic
hybrid materials.

The 0D crystal structures designed in this
work demonstrate a luminescence
efficiency with PLQY values of up to 3.07% for the white light-emitting
(R)ZnBr3(DMSO), which also happens to be the most stable
(thermally and in air) member of the family. The combinations of the
organic cation and inorganic components used in this work are therefore
responsible for the preparation of room-temperature luminescent materials
that have comparable or better PLQY values to other Pb- and Cd-based
hybrid halides reported in the literature. Importantly, this work
paves the way to band alignment engineering of organic and inorganic
components in hybrid organic–inorganic halides to controllably
create type I and type II band alignments and to fabricate materials
where the emission originates from organic, inorganic, or both components.
The fast emission from the hydrogen-rich organic cations, observed
for the compounds prepared in this work, may enable the development
of fast scintillators that are capable of detecting fast neutrons
via proton recoil.

Syntheses of Hybrid Organic–Inorganic Compounds
For
the syntheses of hybrid organic–inorganic halides of group
12 metals, various solvents including N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), DMSO, and methanol were tried. Among these,
DMSO was selected as the most suitable solvent because of the highest
solubility of the precursor organic salts trimethyl(2,3,4,5,6-pentamethylbenzyl)ammonium
halides (R)X (X = Br or I). Details of the syntheses and characterizations
of the organic salts are described in the Supporting Information (see Figures S1–S4). It was determined that
single crystals of target compounds can be grown in 20 mL drams at
65 °C by separately solvating (R)X (X = Br or I) in 2 mL of DMSO
and MX2 (M = Zn or Cd) in 1 mL of methanol and then mixing
the stoichiometric 1:1 molar ratio solutions together.

Bromide-Based
Compounds
(R)ZnBr3(DMSO) crystals
were grown through slow evaporation of their stoichiometric solutions,
as described above. (R)2CdBr4·DMSO was
first obtained by reacting (R)Br and CdBr2 in a nonstoichiometric
1:1 molar ratio. A subsequent stoichiometric reaction with 2:1 molar
ratio of (R)Br/CdBr2 also afforded (R)2CdBr4·DMSO. In all cases, colorless block crystals measuring
up to 3 mm formed over a 3 week crystallization period.

Iodide-Based
Compound
(R)CdI3(DMSO) crystals
were grown through slow evaporation of their stoichiometric solutions
as light-yellow blocks measuring up to 2 mm in size over a 3 week
crystallization period. Syntheses of Zn analogues (R)ZnI3 and (R)2ZnI4 were tried in different loading
ratios of DMF, DMSO, and methanol solutions but were proven unsuccessful.

Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction
The X-ray intensity
data for all compounds were collected on a Bruker Apex CCD diffractometer
with a graphite monochromated Mo Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å)
radiation. For room-temperature measurements (298(2) K), crystals
with good clarity were selected from their mother liquor, cut to size,
covered with Super Glue, affixed to a goniometer head, and allowed
to dry. For low-temperature measurements, crystals were selected from
their mother liquor, placed in Dow Chemical vacuum grease, cut to
size, and then cooled to 100(2) K. The crystal structures for all
compounds were determined from a nonlinear least-squares fit. The
data were corrected for absorption by the semi-empirical method based
on equivalents, and the structures were solved by direct methods using
the SHELXTL program and refined by full-matrix least squares on F2 by the use of all reflections.66,67 All nonhydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement
parameters, all occupancies were refined within two standard deviations,
and all hydrogen atom positions were determined by geometry. Single-crystal
data collection and refinement parameters are summarized in Table 1 and Table S1. Atomic coordinates, equivalent isotropic displacement
parameters, and selected interatomic distances and bond angles can
be found in Tables S2 and S3. Full details
of the crystal structures are summarized in the CIF (Crystallographic
Information File) files that have been deposited in the Cambridge
Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) database and can be found under
deposition numbers 1840612 and 1840614–1840618.

Powder X-ray
Diffraction
For PXRD measurements, solution-processed
samples were dried overnight under vacuum and then ground into powdered
forms. PXRD measurements were carried out on a Rigaku MiniFlex600
system equipped with a D/teX detector using a Ni-filtered Cu Kα
radiation source. Typical PXRD scans were performed in the 5°–90°
(2θ) range, with a step size of 0.02° to determine phase
identity and purity. Data analysis was performed using the Rigaku’s
PDXL2 software package. The baseline originating from the glass slides
used to collect data was corrected using the embedded tool in the
PDXL2 software, and the data were fitted using the decomposition method
(also known as Pawley fitting) embedded in the PDXL2 software package.

Energy-Dispersive X-ray (EDX) Spectroscopy Measurements
EDX measurements were conducted to confirm the heavy element compositions
of the samples (metal/halogen ratios) using a Zeiss Neon EsB equipped
with an Oxford Instruments EDX system.

Optical Measurements
Room-temperature PLE, PL, and
PLQY measurements were performed on a HORIBA Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3
spectrofluorometer using a xenon lamp and Quanta-φ integrating
sphere using the two-curve method in a varied range from 280 to 860
nm. UV–Vis diffuse reflectance was measured to study the optical
absorption properties of the compounds. Measurements were performed
on polycrystalline powder samples using a PerkinElmer Lambda 750 UV/Vis/NIR
spectrometer equipped with a 100 mm Spectralon InGaAs Integrating
Sphere attachment over a 250–1100 nm range. TRPL was measured
on a HORIBA Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer using a time-correlated
single photon counting module. HORIBA Jobin Yvon NanoLEDs (pulsed
light-emitting diodes) were used as the excitation source. The duration
of the light pulse was shorter than 2 ns. Temperature dependence PL
spectra were measured on single-crystal samples using a double monochromator
U1000 equipped with a photomultiplier. The excitation wavelength was
the 325 nm (3.815 eV) line of a Spectra Physics Beamlock 2085 argon
laser. The samples were placed in a helium bath cryostat, and the
measurements were performed between 2 and 300 K. Room-temperature
solid-state mid-IR measurements were performed on a Bruker Tensor27
IR over the range of 400–4000 cm–1 on solid
samples that were ground and then pressed into a matrix of KBr. The
IR measurements show the presence of well-defined vibration mode peaks
similar to that of their organic salts, as shown in Figure S6, which
confirms the good quality of the compounds.

First-Principle Calculations
All calculations were
based on DFT implemented in the VASP code.68 The interaction between ions and electrons was described by the
projector augmented wave method.69 The
kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV for the plane-wave basis was used
for all calculations. Experimental lattice parameters were used while
the atomic positions were fully relaxed until the residual forces
were less than 0.02 eV/Å. Electronic band structures and DOSs
were calculated using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)
exchange-correlation functional,70 whereas
excitons were treated by using the more advanced hybrid PBE0 functional,62 which has 25% nonlocal Fock exchange. Previous
PBE0 calculations have provided accurate results on exciton properties
in hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites.23,26,71
