Aviation industry has the challenge of halving CO2 emissions by 2050, as
compared to 2005. An alternative are drop-in biofuels, which are sustainable
and fully compatible with aircraft engines and also can be mixed with
fossil jet fuel. Among the feedstock for biojet fuel production, licuri
(Syagrus coronata) can be highlighted
as most of its fatty acids are in the jet fuel range. Thereby, this
work investigated the composition and physicochemical characterization
of licuri oil and licuri biodiesel, both with satisfactory results
according to international standards, with the purpose of obtaining
hydrocarbons in the range of jet fuel from these feedstock, by catalytic
deoxygenation. The semi-batch reaction, using a 5% Pd/C catalyst at
300 °C and 207 psi, produced n-alkanes with
a conversion of up to 39.2%. The n-alkane selectivity
was 80.7%, in addition to CO2 selectivity of 83.4% for
biodiesel, indicating the preference for the decarboxylation pathway
and also confirming licuri as a potential raw material for biojet
fuel.

==== Body
1 Introduction
One of the main goals
of the aviation industry is to develop an
effective solution for its environmental impact and ensure the sustainability
of the growth of this means of transport, what induces economic growth.
CO2 emissions from this sector were 705 million tons in
2013. This number accounted for about 2% of global emissions in that
year and, if nothing is done, it should increase by 340% to 3.1 billion
tons by 2050. The challenge, therefore, is to halve CO2 emissions by 2050, as compared to the 2005 values. Thus, the aviation
industry would become carbon-neutral by 2020, as established by the
International Air Transport Association.1−3

The aviation industry
understands that to meet the goal of reducing
CO2 emissions, it is necessary to replace part of the fossil
fuel used with biofuel. Two conventional options are biodiesel and
ethanol, which are widely produced and sold renewable fuels. However,
they are chemically distinct from fossil fuels and cannot be considered
as substitutes for all petroleum-derived fuels.4 Therefore, this industry seeks the development of drop-in
biofuels, which are fully compatible with current technologies and
can be mixed in proportions up to 50% v/v. with fossil jet fuel, without
the need for changes in the engines, aircraft, and distribution infrastructure.
One of its advantages is its use without compromising the safety of
the aviation system.5−7

These drop-in fuels are very similar in performance
to the conventional
jet fuel and they are virtually free of sulfur and aromatics.8 In addition, the synthetic fuels have excellent
properties once they do not present oxygen in their composition.9

There are several methods for processing
raw material into biojet
fuel. Among them, two stand out, as they are certified and standardized
by ASTM in a mixture of up to 50% for use in jet fuel: Fischer–Tropsch
(FT-SPK) and hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA-SPK). There
is also the alcohol to jet (ATJ-SPK) and hydroprocessed fermented
sugars (HFS-SIP), also standardized, but only allowed for smaller
proportions in the mixtures.10,11

Alternative routes
for jet fuel production change according to
the feedstock used in the synthesis. Jet fuel synthesized from renewable
oils can be defined as hydroprocessed renewable jet, also known as
hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) or paraffin synthetic
kerosene (bio-SPK).2 Biojet fuels differ
from renewable diesel by composition. Renewable diesel contains C10–C22
hydrocarbons, and biojet fuel is composed of a mixture of C8–C16
with a maximum aromatic content of 25%, with a very low freezing point.
The hydrotreating process of fatty acids allows for the production
of hydrocarbons from a renewable source, which can be processed into
aviation fuels, as well as conventional transport fuels, such as biogasoline
and renewable diesel. However, jet fuel needs to be completely dry,
and it needs to display a much lower freezing point and a smaller
viscosity than other fuels to meet the requirements of the international
standard ASTM D 1655. The main composition difference between jet
fuel and diesel is the hydrogen chain size range. Diesel oil has a
higher hydrocarbon chain size than jet fuel.12

In the hydrotreating process, deoxygenation occurs, which
leads
to the formation of saturated and/or unsaturated linear hydrocarbons
by two main reaction routes: decarboxylation (eq 1), generating paraffinic hydrocarbons, and
decarbonylation (eq 2), which produces olefins.13 A third route
is also possible to occur, on a smaller scale: hydrodeoxygenation
(eq 3), in which there
is no carbon loss in the chain.14 Snåre
et al.15 observed that, for stearic acid,
both the decarbolylation and decarbonylation reactions are thermodynamically
favorable 1   2   3  The principle of the catalytic deoxygenation
reaction is based on the cracking of the fatty acids at the conditions
of high temperatures and pressure, with the aid of the catalyst. As
a result, according to eqs 1–3, paraffinic and olefinic hydrocarbons
are generated as the main products. Carbon dioxide (CO2), which is one of the main gaseous products formed, helps to maintain
a high catalytic activity in the reactor because it is more easily
desorbed than carbon monoxide (CO), and the consumption of hydrogen
(H2) decreases once the hydrogen products formed from eq 1 are saturated.16−18

Simakova et al.18 studied the decarboxylation
rates of different fatty acids, whose chains varied between 18 and
22 carbons. The results were almost similar upon the usage of the
Pd/C catalyst, regardless the fatty acid chain size.

Mäki-Arvela
et al.19 reported rather comprehensive
investigations on the deoxygenation of fatty acids in the liquid phase
for the biofuel production. The catalyst used in the catalytic deoxygenation
at 300 °C included Ir, Ni, Pt, Rh, and Ru on different supports;
Ni-Raney, PdPt/C, and Os/C; and 1, 5, and 10% by weight Pd/C. The
5% Pd/C catalyst was identified as the most active and most selective
one for n-heptadecane production through the deoxygenation
of stearic acid.20

Choi et al.7 obtained yields above 86%
for the catalytic deoxygenation reaction. In this study, it was possible
to obtain alkanes in the range of biojet fuel without the addition
of hydrogen. A catalyst based on W/Pt/TiO2 was prepared
and used in the catalytic deoxygenation of fatty acids without added
hydrogen, and it was possible to obtain products free of oxygen, which
can be transformed into biojet fuel.

The precursor substrates
of the methyl or ethyl esters, whose paraffinic
chain size resembles the one of the range of petroleum distillates
equivalent to fossil jet fuel, comprises fractions of vegetable oils
or animal fats with linear or branched chains containing 10–17
carbons.16 For this reason, several studies
and flight tests have been carried out with biojet fuel obtained from
babassu and coconut, which display as major compounds lauric acid
(C12:0), and palm whose principal component is palmitic acid (C16:0).
So, another oleaginous that deserves attention is licuri (Syagrus coronata). The fatty acid with the highest
concentration in licuri oil is lauric acid (C12:0).21 Therefore, licuri is shown as a possible feedstock source
for the production of biojet fuel.

Licuri is the fruit of a
Brazilian native palm from Braziian Atlantic
Forest, it is also adjusted to drier regions, and it has a great energetic
potential. The species stands out because it has adapted very well
to the semiarid region of northeastern Brazil, which presents low
social and economic development rates. Licuri palm, whose almond possesses
a high oil content (around 38 wt %), presents high potential for the
development of this region, with an annual oil production of 99 million
tons. It has many utilities, from biofuels production to medicinal,
building, and handcrafting applications. In addition, it has a high
production capacity, equivalent to 4 t ha–1 per
year of almonds, as this palm tree blooms and fruits the whole year.21,22

Therefore, the present work aimed at obtaining hydrocarbons
between
C9 and C17, in the range of biojet fuel, originating from licuri oil
and licuri biodiesel. They were subjected to catalytic deoxygenation
by semi-batch reaction, using the Pd/C catalyst.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Licuri Oil
Licuri oil was analyzed
by a model GCMS-QP2010 Shimadzu gas chromatograph coupled to the mass
spectrometer (GC-MS), equipped with split injector, for identification
of its components. The capillary column used was a Durabond-DB-5HT
(Agilent Technologies; length, 30 m; diameter, 25 mm; film thickness,
0.25 μm). Helium was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 3
mL min–1, and the sample injection volume was 1
μL. The MS detector temperature was 250 °C. The oil was
esterified following the methodology described by Hartman and Lago.23 In addition to its composition, the oil was
also evaluated by its physicochemical characterization. The acid value
was determined by the Ca 5a-40 method and the iodine value according
to the Cd 1-25 method.24 The density at
20 °C was performed on a KEM-DA130N portable digital densimeter,
following the ASTM standard D 4052. The flow properties assessed were
kinematic viscosity, cloud point, pour point, and cold filter plugging
point. The kinematic viscosity was measured at 40 °C, according
to the ASTM standard D 445 in a Julabo-V18 bath viscosimeter. The
cloud point and the pour point were performed in a model MPC-102L
Tanaka Pour/Cloud Point Tester, according to the standards ASTM D
7683 and ASTM D 6749, respectively. The cold filter plugging point
was determined in a model AFP-102 performed on Tanaka, according to
ASTM D 6371. The oxidation stability analysis was carried out in a
model 743 Rancimat (Metrohm), according to AOCS Cd 12B.

2.2 Licuri Biodiesel Synthesis and Characterization
The
transesterification was performed by the methyl route, with
basic catalysis, in a 1:6 molar ratio (oil/methanol). The catalyst
used was potassium hydroxide (97% purity, Fisher Chemical) and methanol
(99.8% purity, Fisher Chemical). Licuri oil, extracted in the state
of Bahia, Brazil, was added to the alkoxy, and the mixture was stirred
for 40 min, at 30 °C. Glycerin was removed by decantation. The
biodiesel was washed with heated water at 60 °C until the catalyst
was completely removed. Subsequently, vacuum drying was carried out
at 80 °C. The ester content was determined by gas chromatography
following the method EN 14103.25

The parameters acid value and iodine value were determined in a Metrohm
potentiometric titrator, according to the standards ASTM D 664 and
EN 14111, respectively. The density at 20 °C was measured under
the same conditions as the licuri oil. The flash point determination
was carried out according to ASTM D 93 standard, in the Tanaka APM-7
Pensky–Martens closed cup tester. The evaluation of the flow
properties, kinematic viscosity, cloud point, pour point, and cold
filter plugging point followed the same conditions of the licuri oil.
The oxidative stability was determined according to the standard EN
14112 by a Metrohm 743 Rancimat.

2.3 Reduction
of the Pd/C Catalyst
Before
the reaction, the catalyst reduction step must be performed. In this
experiment, the activated carbon-supported palladium catalyst from
Sigma-Aldrich was used in a proportion of 5% by mass. Initially, the
catalyst underwent a treatment process. The solvents used, n-decane (C10) and n-dodecane (C12) (99%
purity), were supplied by Aldrich.

First, the catalyst was placed
in an oven at 105 °C for 12 h for drying. Then, 335 mg of the
catalyst was placed in the reactor for the reduction process in 22.4
g of n-dodecane.16

The reduction of the catalyst, lasting 1 h, occurred after the
reactor reached a temperature of 200 °C, with a heating rate
of 2 °C min–1. The process occurred under hydrogen
gas at a constant flow of 30 mL min–1 at ambient
pressure under gentle mechanical stirring.

2.4 Semi-Batch
Catalytic Deoxygenation Reaction
First, the ideal solvent
for the reaction was sought. For this,
some factors were evaluated: boiling temperature, vapor pressure,
and the retention time in the GC, as some peaks could be overlapped.
Of the evaluated solvents, n-dodecane was the best
suited to the process.26

The catalytic
deoxygenation reactions were performed in a MicroClave Autoclave Engineers
(50 mL) reactor equipped with a Dispersimax impeller (mechanical stirring).
The tests were performed at a temperature of 300 °C, at a heating
rate of 5 °C min–1. A blank test, in the absence
of the catalyst, was carried out, with the objective of evaluating
the possibility of thermal deoxygenation at 300 °C.

The
process occurred under a constant helium flow of 60 mL min–1 with 5% hydrogen, at a pressure of 207 psi. For the
pressure to remain high with the gas flow, it was necessary to use
a back-pressure regulating valve. The reactions lasted 4 h.

For the start of the reaction, it was necessary to cool the reactor
after the reduction step. Thereafter, the mass equivalent to 1.9 mmol
for licuri oil or 5.6 mmol for biodiesel was added. The time zero
was counted after the reactor reached a temperature of 300 °C,
pressure of 207 psi, and a stirring of 1000 rpm, under a 60 mL min–1 constant flow of 5% H2 in He gas mixture.

After the end of the reaction, all of the products were collected,
characterized, and weighted to perform the reaction mass balance.
The products characterization considered the average of two successful
runs.

2.5 Products Characterization
The reactor
gas products were analyzed by a Pfeiffer PrismaPlus online quadrupole
mass spectrometer (QMS) with closed ion source, heated capillary inlet
system, and Quadstar 32-bit software. The H2 (m/z = 2), He (m/z = 4), CO (m/z = 28), and CO2 (m/z = 44) signals were
uninterruptedly monitored.

The reaction products were analyzed
in an HP5890 GC gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization
detector and an Econo-Cap EC-5 capillary column (30 m length, 0.32
mm diameter, 1.0 μm film thickness). The oven temperature was
programmed for a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 from 80 to 300 °C. Samples of 0.05 μL were injected at
a temperature of 300 °C, with a split rate of 50:1 at 10 psi
pressure. The determination of the reaction products concentration
was determined using a three-point calibration method for expected
products with n-decane (C10) as an internal standard.

To evaluate the catalytic deoxygenation reaction, n-alkanes yield, n-alkanes selectivity, and CO2 selectivity were calculated according to eqs 4–7. The n-alkane yield was calculated by the molar
ratio between these compounds and the total reactants (eq 4). The n-alkane
selectivity was calculated by the percentage ratio between n-alkanes yield and the total conversion (eq 5). Conversion is related to the
molar ratio between unreacted reactants and the total reactants moles
(eq 6). The CO2 selectivity was calculated from the relationship between the number
of CO2 moles and the number of the total moles of CO and
CO2 gases (eq 7), the possible gaseous co-products for the catalytic deoxygenation
reaction 4   5   6   7  

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Licuri Oil Characterization
Table 1 shows the
percentages
of the fatty acids present in the licuri oil from gas chromatography.
The results point out that 81.8% of its molar composition consists
of saturated fatty acids and 18.2% of unsaturated fatty acids.

Table 1 Fatty Acid Composition of Licuri Oil
fatty acid	% experimental
results	% literature21	
caprylic acid (C8:0)	8.8	9.0	
capric acid (C10:0)	6.0	6.0	
lauric acid (C12:0)	36.0	42.0	
myristic acid (C14:0)	16.5	16.0	
palmitic acid (C16:0)	8.9	8.0	
stearic acid (C18:0)	5.7	4.0	
oleic acid (C18:1)	14.2	12.0	
linoleic acid (C18:2)	3.9	3.0	
The major compounds are lauric
and myristic acids, accounting for
more than 50% of the oil composition. Thus, in addition to the other
components with chains of 10–18 carbons (excluding the fatty
acid C8), the licuri oil presents over 90% of its composition within
the range of jet fuel and can be considered as a potential precursor
for the production of biofuels.27 The values
of Table 1 agreed with
the literature.21

The quality of
licuri oil was evaluated through the study of its
physicochemical characterization. The low acid and iodine values confirm
its low unsaturation. The kinematic viscosity was slightly above the
result obtained by Teixeira da Silva de La Salles et al.,21 but quite small compared to other oils, such as soybean and cotton oil,
and similar to babassu oil. Table 2 shows the physicochemical properties of the oil, as
compared to the literature.21

3.2 Licuri
Biodiesel Characterization
Table 3 presents the
quality parameters of licuri biodiesel. Licuri biodiesel properties
are within the limits specified by the ASTM D 6751 standard. As for
the EN 14214 standard, lucuri biodiesel does not meet the oxidative
stability specification. However, this parameter can be adjusted with
the application of antioxidants. It is also worth mentioning that
with its flow properties, and even with a large percentage of saturated
chain esters, the licuri biodiesel presented a low cloud point and
a low cold filter plugging point.

of 99.5%, according to Table 4.

3.3 Semi-Batch Reactions
Figures 1 and 2 show the catalytic deoxygenation reaction of licuri
oil and licuri
biodiesel, respectively. It is possible to verify a greater drop in
H2 concentration at the beginning of the deoxygenation
reaction of biodiesel (Figure 2), representing a hydrogen consumption. The temperature line,
in turn, remained stable at 300 °C throughout the process, from
time zero to the end of the reaction, lasting 4 h.

Figure 1 Catalytic semi-batch
deoxygenation reaction of licuri oil at 300
°C for 4 h.

Figure 2 Catalytic semi-batch
deoxygenation reaction of licuri biodiesel
at 300 °C for 4 h.

Licuri oil is composed
of different triacylglycerides. Its triacylglyceride
structure, because of its three fatty acid chains, has a higher density
(very close structure) than biodiesel. Indeed, the licuri oil density
is 924 kg m–3, compared to 876 kg m–3, for the licuri biodiesel. Thus, it is possible that this causes
steric hindrance. It can be a factor for impeding the reaction to
occur. On the other hand, the biodiesel structure does not have this
inhibiting effect because it contains just one chain. Comparing Figures 1 and 2, it can be noted that the hydrogen consumption for the oil
reaction is smaller than that for the biodiesel, indicating a lower
reaction rate.

Table 5 indicates
the mass balance of the reactions by means of the weighted values
for the reactants and products of the reaction. The value of recovery
yield was obtained by the mass ratio between the products and the
reactants. The product mass is the sum of condensates, the liquid
phase in the reactor, solids, and the gaseous products (calculated
from the values obtained in the QMS). The overall reactant mass, on
the other hand, is the sum of C12 solvent, reactant (oil or biodiesel),
and the catalyst, which were weighed and added to the reactor before
the beginning of the experiment.

Table 5 Batch Reactions Mass

dry filtrates (g)	0.327	0.331	
gaseous products (g)	0.148	0.145	
recovery yield
(%)	93.7	91.8	
The recovery yield of 93.7 wt % for reaction
using oil and 91.9
wt % for biodiesel are consistent with this type of batch reactor,
in which there is no liquid reactant flow. The losses can be explained
mainly by the gaseous products, which were not liquefied in the condenser,
besides the adsorption processes, in less quantity.28 The results were higher than those obtained by Arend et
al.,28 which used a continuous reactor
for catalytic deoxygenation of oleic acid, whose mass balance values
were below 90% at the steady-state reaction.

Table 6 shows the
experimental results of the catalytic deoxygenation reactions, in
relation to conversion, n-alkanes yield, n-alkanes selectivity, and the selectivity of the gas produced
in the reaction. It also shows the most probable reaction pathway,
and some results from the literature for similar reactions. Conversion
is always higher than yield, once byproducts and degraded products
from fatty acids are formed, and these oxygenated co-products are
not taken into account in the reaction yield. These products are reactants
that have been converted but are not part of the yield because these
products are not the purpose of the reaction. The final composition
of the reaction output is made of n-alkanes, oxygenated
subproducts, and unconverted reagents.6

All of the literature results
presented in Table 6 were obtained in the same conditions of
the experimental results of this work, except for bio-oil, which used
a Ni/ZrO2 catalyst.

High CO2 selectivity
values, above 75%, were obtained
in both cases. The decarboxylation route (eq 1) is preferred, as the formation of hydrocarbons
occurs with the loss of carboxyl, as CO2. It is known that
the formation of unsaturated compounds (eq 2) contributes to the H2 consumption,
competing with the process, leading to the formation, although lower,
of carbon monoxide (CO).26 Carbon monoxide,
in this reaction, accelerates the deactivation of the catalyst, decreasing
its efficiency over time. Licuri oil composition, on the other hand,
presents a lower percentage of unsaturation compared to other oils,
such as camelina oil and babassu oil.30

Table 6 shows
lower
values compared to those found for reactions with stearic acid in
the literature. However, it is important to note that the feedstock
used by Choi et al.7 and Miao et al.29 is composed of a single fatty acid component,
whose reaction at these conditions is already consolidated, attributed
to its higher adsorption on the activated carbon support.31,32 When the results of the catalytic deoxygenation reactions from licuri
oil and biodiesel were compared to the reaction from the bio-oil,
whose matrix of components is also complex, the yields and selectivity
to n-alkanes were higher.29 These results can also be influenced by the catalyst deactivation
since the fixed bed contributes to the deactivation of the catalyst,
whose recovery is not possible during the reaction process.33

The composition data, in molar percentage,
of the n-alkanes hydrocarbons obtained for the catalytic
deoxydation reaction
of both licuri oil and licuri biodiesel are shown in Table 7.

According to Ford et
al.,31 the increase
of the number of carbons in the chain structure facilitates the catalytic
deoxygenation process. It is possible to observe this behavior observing
the increase in the concentration for larger hydrocarbon chains and
the decrease in the concentration for smaller chains. This point can
be discussed, comparing to the reactants chain compositions, in Table 7 (catalytic deoxydation
products), with the composition of licuri oil and licuri biodiesel
in Tables 1 and 4, respectively. As an example, the increase of C18
composition percentage, from 23.4% in the case of licuri biodiesel
(Table 4) to 35.6%
C17 in products (Table 7), with the loss of 1 carbon, is observed, after the licuri biodiesel
deoxygenation reaction. The C8, in turn, decreased from 9% (Table 4) to 5.2% C7 (Table 7). For the oil, the
intensity of the process is less pronounced, probably due to the large
triacylglyceride structure, making the adsorption process more difficult.

The n-alkanes composition of reaction products
is very similar to the feedstock (Tables 1, 4, and 7), considering the loss of one carbon in its chain,
thus confirming the deoxygenation process, by means of decarboxylation
(reaction 1) and/or decarbonylation
(reaction 2) and discarding
the hydrodeoxygenation (reaction 3), which would lead to a correlation without carbon loss in
the chain. This is ratified by the formation and release of monoxide
and dioxide carbon gas. Therefore, for the reaction under these conditions,
the occurrence of the decarboxylation pathway is suggested since the
selectivity to CO2 is much greater than that to CO, remembering
that the sum of these selectivities is always 100%.

4 Conclusions
The attainment of an n-alkane
conversion up to
39.2% in the present wok can be considered satisfactory since the
reaction in this experiment occurs in a semi-batch reaction with fixed-bed
reactor. This fact confirms the potential of licuri biodiesel as a
precursor feedstock for biojet fuel. Despite the high cost, the Pd/C
catalyst can present better results, if it is applied in continuous
bed.

However, it is important to note that the product of this
research
is not ready be used once the n-alkanes require the
isomerization step followed by the separation process by fractional
distillation. The isomerization step is needed, as these hydrocarbons
must be converted into short iso-alkanes, which are compounds with
superior cold flow properties. Therefore, it is possible to meet the
strict jet fuel requirements, according to ASTM D 1655 standard for
jet fuel certification and to ASTM D 7566 for fuels containing alternative
synthesized hydrocarbons.34,35

In this work,
a yield of 32.3% for n-alkanes was
obtained for the licuri oil, a result close to the one for biodiesel.
This result, besides the selectivity to alkanes, suggests that the
transesterification process of the biodiesel synthesis is not an outstanding
stage for the optimization for the biojet production process. However,
the decrease of the selectivity to CO2 when using the oil
in the place of biodiesel indicates the possibility of shortening
the useful life of the catalyst because CO deactivates the catalyst
very strongly.26
