The sensitive, selective, and practical
detection of aliphatic
alcohols is a continuing technical challenge with significant impact
in public health research and environmental remediation efforts. Reported
herein is the use of a β-cyclodextrin derivative to promote
proximity-induced interactions between aliphatic alcohol analytes
and a brightly colored organic dye, which resulted in highly analyte-specific
color changes that enabled accurate alcohol identification. Linear
discriminant analysis of the color changes enabled 100% differentiation
of the colorimetric signals obtained from methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol
in combination with BODIPY and Rhodamine dyes. The resulting solution-state
detection system has significant broad-based applicability because
it uses only easily available materials to achieve such detection
with moderate limits of detection obtained. Future research with this
sensor system will focus on decreasing limits of detection as well
as on optimizing the system for quantitative detection applications.

Introduction
Increased interest
in using non-mass spectrometry-based techniques
for the detection of small organic compounds has arisen due to practical
challenges associated with the use of mass spectrometry that limit
broad-based applicability.1 Such challenges
include the fact that expensive, bulky instrumentation is often required
to accomplish mass spectrometry-based detection combined with significant
user training to operate the instrumentation effectively, which prevents
detection by relatively untrained citizen scientists.2 Many newly developed chemosensors have focused on systems
that allow for portable, on-site testing of the target analytes without
requiring high-end, costly laboratory instrumentation.3 A challenging aspect of designing portable chemosensors
is the need to maintain high selectivity, sensitivity, and broad-based
applicability in the efficient detection of various analytes, especially
among analytes that are similar in structure and size.

By utilizing
the ability of cyclodextrin to act as a supramolecular
scaffold that facilitates proximity-induced, highly analyte-specific
interactions between an analyte of interest and a high-quantum yield
fluorophore, the Levine group has developed sensitive and selective
fluorescence-based systems for analyte detection.4,5 The
systems utilize cyclodextrin-promoted fluorescence energy transfer
from an analyte to a high quantum yield fluorophore for photophysically
active analytes6 or cyclodextrin-promoted,
analyte-specific fluorescence modulation for nonphotophysically active
analytes.7 In addition to monitoring the
analyte-specific fluorescence changes, there are often analyte-specific
color changes in the fluorophore, promoted through the cyclodextrin-assisted
interaction of the brightly colored fluorophore and the target analyte.8 Advantages of colorimetric detection include
the fact that the color changes can be easily detected using naked
eye detection9 or RGB analysis.10 Significant literature precedent indicates that
colorimetric analysis can be optimized for the detection of very small
concentrations of toxicants both in solution-state and in solid-state
detection devices.11−13

Colorimetric detection has potential utility
in the detection of
aliphatic alcohols, a class of analytes commonly found in commercial
products that can cause health concerns, especially at elevated concentrations.14 These alcohols, including isopropanol, ethanol,
and methanol, are found in household cleaners,15 paints,16 self-care and beauty
products,17 and beverages.18 Moreover, the need for aliphatic alcohol detection is rising
with the increasing prevalence of at-home beer and alcohol production.19 With almost no regulation of this process currently
in place, there is significant potential for poorly controlled ethanol
concentrations20 as well as the potential
for methanol contamination and associated methanol toxicity.21 Furthermore, the brewing process can sometimes
lead to the formation of other byproducts, including n-propanol, isobutanol, and isoamyl alcohol.22 Because methods to detect these byproducts are not widely available,
significant public health risks from their ingestion remain.23 Additional potential applications of colorimetric
aliphatic alcohol detection include the use of a colorimetric device
to detect alcohol intoxication in both medical24 and law-enforcement settings.25 Finally, forensic analyses would benefit from the detection of a
range of aliphatic alcohols that are known bacterial byproducts and
could provide important forensic information.26

Previous reports on the detection of aliphatic alcohols by
colorimetric
methods include the use of a single ionic liquid, containing a modified
pH indicator, to distinguish between eight aliphatic alcohols27 as well as copper-containing metal–organic
frameworks28 and iron complexes29 to accomplish effective detection. Cyclodextrins
have also been reported in isolated instances to act as sensors for
aliphatic alcohols through the use of cyclodextrin-based stationary
phases in chiral chromatography30 as well
as through the use of a quartz crystal microbalance coated with cyclodextrin-derived
compounds.31 To the best of our knowledge,
the combination of cyclodextrin-based complexation and colorimetric
detection has not been reported to date.

While the fluorescence
modulation method used previously in the
Levine group provided good sensitivity and high selectivity among
structurally similar analytes, it required laboratory-grade instrumentation,
which severely limits widespread usage. Although portable fluorimetry
has been accomplished using smartphone-based systems,32 these systems can be challenging for the user to implement,
which means that portable colorimetric systems can have notable advantages.
Reported herein is the development of an extremely practical colorimetric
detection system for isopropanol, ethanol, and methanol, based on
color changes in a dye–cyclodextrin association complex upon
addition of the aliphatic alcohol, with such color changes intimately
dependent on the structure of each of the alcohols (structures 1–3, Figure 1) and its association with both the cyclodextrin
scaffold and the colorimetric dye (BODIPY (4) or Rhodamine
6G (5), Figure 1). This system is highly robust with alcohol-induced color
changes detectable even by a high school student working with unpurified
tap water solutions and, even in its optimized formulation, uses no
laboratory-grade instrumentation. Rather, the system uses a spray-painted
plastic box equipped with LED lights to facilitate consistent coloration
and enable reproducible results.

Results and Discussion
Selection of Data Processing
and Analytical Methods
Separation of the signals obtained
from the photographs was performed
using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as such an analysis enables
the user to find the axes of maximum separation, which in turn facilitates
highly accurate identification of unknown analytes.33 LDA has been used for analysis of a variety of related
systems,34 including colorimetric detection
schemes,35 and is used herein to enable
high differentiation between signals that correspond to the different
aliphatic alcohol analytes. The input data for LDA was the red, green,
and blue (RGB) values of the photographs, which has strong precedence
in the colorimetric sensing literature.36−38 In general, high clustering
among points from the same analyte (represented by the same color
and shape in Figures 2, 3, 5, and 6) and large amounts of space between the analyte
clusters lead to high proportions of total dispersion (values close
to 1) and indicates a high-performing system. Less effective clustering
within the same group and/or an overlap between the clusters of two
different groups leads to lower values for proportion of total dispersion,
which in turn leads to a higher ratio of misclassification of unknown
analytes.

Optimization of Cyclodextrin
A variety of cyclodextrin
hosts was screened with the goal of determining which supramolecular
host would provide maximum separation between the analyte-induced
color changes, with such separation quantified as the “cumulative
proportion of total dispersion.” An example of significant
dispersion of analyte clusters is shown for 2-HP-β-CD (Figure 2C), and a contrasting
example with overlapping areas between clusters is shown for Me-β-CD
(Figure 2B). Using
linear discriminant analysis of the RGB data collected from the sample photos, it was determined that
the 2-HP-β-CD had the highest dispersion using both BODIPY and
Rhodamine (dyes 4 and 5) as color-changing
elements with cumulative proportions of total dispersion values of
1.000 and 0.998, respectively (Table 1). Similar trends in the cyclodextrin host were seen
with Rhodamine (5) (Figure 3) with 2-HP-β-CD showing the greatest
dispersion (Figure 3C) compared to that of β-CD and Me-β-CD (Figure 3A,B, respectively).

a Values were generated
after analysis
using SYSTAT 13 LDA software.

The higher signal dispersion that was observed when using 2-HP-β-CD
is likely due to strong binding between the dyes and 2-HP-β-CD
as well as the high flexibility and water solubility of 2-HP-β-CD
compared to the other hosts investigated.39 High binding constants between the alcohol analytes and cyclodextrin
hosts increase the strength of interactions between the analyte, host,
and dye, resulting in more sensitive analyte-induced signal changes,
whereas greater flexibility and water solubility increase the availability
of this host to participate in the desired interactions.40−42 Of note, control experiments conducted in the absence of cyclodextrin
resulted in markedly lower dispersion of the signals with significant
misclassification of the analytes observed. This was especially true
when using Rhodamine as the signal transducing element (75% correct
identification of analytes using jackknife classification analysis)
but was also decreased using BODIPY (92% correct identification).

Dye Selection
The dyes selected for analysis include
highly colored BODIPY (compound 4) and Rhodamine (compound 5) analogues. These dyes were selected due to their known
strong coloration (aligned with their high molar absorptivity coefficients)43 as well as good aqueous stability44 and solubility.45 Moreover, because this system is expected to be used in a wide variety
of environments, the toxicity of all components is an important consideration.
BODIPY has relatively low toxicity and has been used in a variety
of biologically relevant applications;46,47 while Rhodamine
6G has some toxicity,48 this toxicity is
tunable via judicious choice of counterions,49 and related dyes have still been used for intracellular applications.50 As a result, both reported dyes have significant
potential in the development of practical detection schemes.

Selection
of the Aqueous Environment
All experiments
reported herein were conducted in deionized water, although a demonstration
of the efficacy of this method in tap water samples would strengthen
the applicability of this method. High concentrations of ions in tap
water have been reported51 and include
calcium and magnesium ions,52 which both
have been shown to interact with cyclodextrin.53,54 To measure the general applicability of this method to tap water
samples, we conducted experiments using dye 4 in tap
water. Results of this experiment indicated somewhat decreased selectivity
compared to deionized water, which shows that the tap water components
have a deleterious effect on the system performance, although overall
75% correct identification using dye 4 was still observed.

Further insight into the selectivity observed between the alcohol
analytes was obtained from computational investigations. Electrostatic
potential maps of analytes 1–3, generated
using Spartan ‘18 software, showed significant similarities
in the analyte structures with areas of high polarity around the hydroxyl
group (Figure 4). Differences
between the analytes include noticeable size differences as well as
a more concentrated region of positive electron density in methanol
compared to the other analytes as shown by the dark blue color. Such
differences, combined with steric matching of the analytes with the
cyclodextrin cavity and aqueous miscibility of the analytes, contribute
to differing binding affinities with the cyclodextrin,55 resulting in turn in high specificity in the
analyte-induced color changes.

Figure 4 Electrostatic potential maps of (A) methanol,
(B) ethanol, and
(C) isopropanol. Red areas indicate regions of negative electron density,
and blue areas indicate regions of positive electron density. These
computations were done using Spartan version 18 computational software.

Determining the Optimal Concentrations for
Testing
In order to determine the optimal analyte concentration
to achieve
high degrees of analyte-induced separation in the colorimetric responses,
the dependence of the LDA plots on analyte concentration was explicitly
investigated, and the results are summarized in Table 2. These results indicate that BODIPY was
more effective in characterizing data at high analyte concentrations
(3.0 M, Figure 5), whereas Rhodamine provided more dispersed
and accurate results between 0.5 M and 2.0 M concentrations (Figure 6). A plausible explanation for these observed results relates
to the higher binding constant between BODIPY and 2-HP-β-CD
of 3.32 × 105 M–1 compared to 1.59
× 105 M–1 between Rhodamine and
the cyclodextrin. The lower binding constant of Rhodamine allows for
better detection at lower alcohol concentrations because the dye is
being displaced easier. Because BODIPY binds with a slightly higher
binding energy, a higher concentration of alcohol needs to be added
to the system in order to displace the dye, causing an overall decrease
in system performance. Of note, the fact that the dye is dissolved
in isopropanol means that all systems contain a low percentage of
this analyte; nonetheless, the markedly higher amounts of analytes
added to the solution mean that the isopropanol concentration from
the dye solution has a relatively minor effect on the overall signal
observed.

Section.

Additional computational studies
conducted using MOE 2018 software
provided important information about the lowest energy docking conformation
of each dye with 2-HP-β-CD in a pure water solvent system, and
the results are shown in Figure 7. Of note, BODIPY (4) exhibited markedly
more inclusion in the cyclodextrin host compared to Rhodamine (5) with a substantial portion of the Rhodamine remaining exposed
to the solvent. This solvent-exposed area of Rhodamine has a greater
ability to interact with the analyte in solution. This result implies
that dye displacement by the alcohol may not be necessary to effect
a color change if the alcohol and dye interact via the solvent-accessible
portion. Such interactions are not dependent on the binding constant
of the dyes in cyclodextrin and provide an additional mechanism by
which the system can lead to analyte-specific color changes. Efforts
to investigate the extent to which either or both mechanisms (i.e.,
dye displacement from the cavity and/or interactions between the dye
and analyte through solvent-exposed areas) are operative in this system
are currently underway in our laboratory.

fluorine. For Rhodamine, the teal color represents carbon, gray represents
hydrogen, red represents oxygen, and dark blue represents nitrogen.

Moreover, the addition of the alcohol analyte to
the solution of
dye in cyclodextrin had measurable changes on the supramolecular complex.
In particular, computational results indicated that adding methanol
to a solution of BODIPY in 2-HPCD resulted in the weakening of the
association between BODIPY and 2-HPCD and strengthening of the affinity
of the BODIPY for the solvent (Figure 8). This result supports that colorimetric changes induced
by the addition of the alcohol analyte are a result of decreased affinity
of the dye for the hydrophobic cyclodextrin cavity.

of BODIPY (4) in 2-HP-β-CD
following the introduction of methanol. The methanol is modeled as
teal stick figures, and the colors of the BODIPY and cyclodextrin
are identical to the colors used in Figure 7.

Determining the LOD and LOQ for the Analytes with Dyes 4 and 5
In addition to measuring the
ability of the system to differentiate between structurally similar
analytes, the sensitivity of the system to low analyte concentrations
was also investigated. For these experiments, the green value of the
photographs was taken to represent the signal output as our results
indicate that this is the signal that changes most significantly in
response to the changing concentration of the analyte. These results
are summarized in Tables 3 (for 0.127 mM BODIPY and 0.093 mM Rhodamine) and 4 (for 0.382 mM BODIPY and
0.280 mM Rhodamine) and indicate that analyte concentrations as low
as 0.2 mM were detectable via this method (for isopropanol, using
relatively high concentrations of Rhodamine). Compared to the LODs
reported in Table 3, there was no significant decrease in the LODs observed with BODIPY
at higher concentrations. In contrast, the Rhodamine trial showed
much better improvement at higher dye concentrations with a 48% decrease
in the LOD and a decrease of 68% in the LOQ value. These marked changes
are in line with the higher solvent and analyte accessibility displayed
by Rhodamine (vide supra) and indicate substantial promise in the
further optimization of sensitive alcohol sensors. An example of a
color array that illustrates the visible color change of BODIPY in
the presence of isopropanol is shown in Figure 9.

Of note,
visible color changes were present in both dye 4 and
dye 5 trials. When using dye 4, the
visible color change is seen going from a dull orange when no alcohol
is present to a bright yellow after all additions, as can be seen
in Figure 9. The stock
solution of this dye, prepared in isopropanol, is bright fluorescent
green. In the dye 5 trials, the initial color is a bright
orange that also becomes a bright yellow after the analyte is added.

Conclusions
Harnessing the highly specific complexation
of small-molecule guests
inside supramolecular cyclodextrin hosts provides a fundamentally
unique system for the detection of those guests. Reported herein is
the application of such host–guest complexes for the colorimetric
detection of alcohols using highly practical, easily available materials
to achieve excellent selectivity (100% differentiation) and moderate
sensitivity (as low as 0.2 M). Computational experiments involving
the cyclodextrin, analytes, and highly colored dyes are invoked to
explain the underlying basis of this strong analyte specificity as
remarkably structurally similar analytes leading to noticeably different
colorimetric read-out signals. Efforts to improve the sensitivity,
broaden the scope of such detection, and develop sensors for mixtures
of alcohols without requiring additional separation procedures (in
accordance with literature reports of analogous systems)56 are currently underway in our laboratory, and
results of these and other investigations will be reported in due
course.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
The alcohol
analytes 1–3 and dyes 4 and 5 shown in Figure 1 were obtained from the Millipore-Sigma chemical company,
and the
cyclodextrins were obtained from the Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI)
chemical company. All chemicals were used as received. All aqueous
solutions were made in glass jars and transferred to 50 mL white,
polypropylene cups that had previously been used in a Keurig machine
and were washed thoroughly prior to usage. A plastic container (with
dimensions 21 cm × 15 cm × 7 cm) was spray-painted using
Krylon Fusion Satin Black spray paint to limit ambient light, and
a 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm hole was cut in the center of the lid to enable
photography of the solution. An additional polypropylene cup previously
used for a Keurig machine was positioned under the opening and secured
to the bottom of the container with electrical tape. Two strips of
LED white light tape (purchased from The Home Depot, with a voltage
of 12, a watt equivalence of 8.5, and an actual color temperature
of 4000 K) were placed on the interior of the container, on all sides
of the container, to provide uniform sample illumination. An annotated
figure of the lightbox can be found in the Supporting Information. The cup that contained the sample was placed into
the secured cup prior to imaging. Photographs of the solutions were
taken from 2.0 cm above the top of the sample cup with a Samsung Galaxy
S8+ (model number: G950U) in the manual mode with the following settings:
ISO set to 100, aperture set to 1/350, macro-focused (close-up focus),
and the white balance set at 5500 K. These settings were kept constant
for all trials to avoid variation in color capture. Preliminary work
that varied the smartphone camera settings led to changes in the RGB
values obtained with automatic settings, leading to reduced consistency
between trials and even within the same trial. Similar challenges
in consistency were observed without using LED lights for consistent
sample illumination. Using the manual mode in both the smartphone
and LED lights around the sample solved the consistency challenges
and enabled accurate and reproducible results to be obtained. Images
were processed with ImageJ software to measure the red, green, and
blue values (RGB) of the solutions following the procedures detailed
below.

General Procedure for Making Stock Solutions
Three
250 mL solutions of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), methyl-β-cyclodextrin
(Me-β-CD), and 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (2-HP-β-CD)
cyclodextrin were made at relatively high concentrations (Table 5). The stock solutions
for BODIPY and Rhodamine dyes were made in isopropanol at concentrations
of 3.80 mM and 2.08 mM, respectively (1 mg/mL for each dye). Diluted
dye solutions were prepared by adding 5.0 mL of the concentrated stock
solutions to a 150 mL volumetric flask and diluting to the mark with
water.

General Procedure for the Optimization of the Supramolecular
Cyclodextrin Host
In a glass sample jar, 10.00 mL of a β-CD
stock solution was combined with 10.00 mL of one of the diluted dye
solutions. This mixture was manually shaken for 1 min to ensure thorough
mixing. After mixing, 5.00 mL of the alcohol was added. This mixture
was transferred to the sample cup and placed in the lightbox. The
cover was placed on, and a photo was taken using the smartphone with
the settings listed above. This procedure was repeated for Me-β-CD
and 2-HP-β-CD with both dyes and each of the three alcohols
(18 total samples). Four trials of each sample were completed with
a calculated average standard deviation in red, green, and blue values
of 0.08, 0.14, and 1.99%, respectively.

General Procedure for the
Optimization of Analyte Concentration
Preparation of the
cyclodextrin–dye solution was performed
following the procedures detailed above with 2-HP-β-CD used
as the host. A 0.5 M solution of the alcohol was made by adding alcohol
to the cyclodextrin–dye solution in the glass jar with additional
samples tested for each alcohol at a variety of concentrations (0.5,
1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 M) using the BODIPY and Rhodamine dyes (8 samples,
3 trials each). These solutions were transferred to a sample cup and
placed in the lightbox, and a photo was taken of every sample.

General
Procedure for Calculating the Limits of Detection (LOD)
and Limits of Quantification (LOQ)
The limit of detection
(LOD), defined as the lowest concentration of the analyte that can
be detected, was obtained using the calibration curve method, following
procedures reported by Loock and co-workers.57 The limit of detection of the blank (LODblank) is defined
according to eq 1 below 1  where m is
the average of the values obtained from the blank sample and SD is
the standard deviation of those measurements. The limit of quantification
(LOQ) is the lowest concentration of the analyte that can be quantified.58 The limit of quantification of the blank is
defined according to eq 2 below 2  where m is
the average of the values obtained from the blank sample and SD is
the standard deviation of those measurements.

Preparation of
the cyclodextrin–dye solution was performed as mentioned above
using 2-HP-β-CD as the optimized supramolecular host. This solution
was transferred to the sample cup and placed in the spray-painted
box. A photograph was taken in order to obtain the blank measurement
of the solution in the absence of any alcohol. Using a 20–200
μL Fisherbrand Elite micropipette, 100 μL of the alcohol
was added, and a picture was taken. These 100 μL additions continued
until 6.0 mL of the alcohol had been added to the solution. This process
was repeated three times for each alcohol and in the presence of each
dye. The RGB values of the solution were used to determine the level
of detection of each alcohol in both dyes.

General Procedure for Obtaining
RGB Values
Photos were
cropped to be the same 500 × 500 pixel ratio focused on the center
of the sample (using https://www.birme.net) to ensure that the area of the picture that was being measured
was consistent across all samples. These images were processed using
the RGB measurement tool plug-in that is available for ImageJ software.
More details of these procedures can be found in the Supporting Information of this manuscript.

General Procedure
for Conducting Linear Discriminant Analyses
SYSTAT 13 statistical
computing software was used to quantify the
degree of separation of color change in the solutions using the following
settings for linear discriminant analysis (LDA): (a) Classical Discriminant
Analysis; (b) Grouping Variable: Analytes (alcohols); (c) Predictors:
Red, Green, and Blue; and (d) Long-Range Statistics: Mahal.

General
Procedure for Computational Modeling
Spartan
version ‘18 was used to calculate the equilibrium values for
the analytes in their ground-state electric potential surfaces using
a semi-empirical PM3 model for each analyte. Molecular Operating Environment
2018 (MOE) was used to do the docking studies for each dye, alcohol
analyte, and 2-HP-β-CD host. A general energy minimization was
performed using the “quick prep” function on the software.
For the docking studies, the set of atoms defined as the receptor
was both 2-HP-β-CD and the solvent so that the dye could move
freely in the system. Placement was done using the Triangle Matches
method with the London Dispersion dG score in 30 poses. Refinement
was done using the Rigid Receptor method with the GBVI/WSA dG score
in 5 poses. This generated the docking of the dye–cyclodextrin
complex with the lowest energy conformation. Summary figures generated
from these procedures can be found in the Supporting Information of this manuscript.
