The present study reports a novel
red phosphorus (RP)/Co3O4–CuO hybrid
as a high-performance anode material
for lithium ion battery that was successfully synthesized by simple
sol gel method and followed by facile ball milling of red phosphorus.
Herein, we outstandingly improved practical application of RP anode
(with its natural insulation property and rapid capacity decay in
during the lithiation process) in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) by
confining nanosized amorphous RP into the Co3O4–CuO nanoparticle while RP can improve the electrochemical
capacity returning and increased capacity of composite in high current
density. This bonding can help maintain electrical contact, prevent
to escape RP from the electrode and confirm the solid electrolyte
interphase upon the large volume change of RP during cycling. As a
result, by judicious usage of components in the RP/Co3O4–CuO hybrid nanostructured anode was achieved an initial
Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% at a current density of 50 mA g–1 and an enhanced cycling stability (683.63 and 470.11
mAh g–1 after 60 cycles at a density of 0.1 and
1 A g1–) with interesting cycling capacity at high
current density of 3 Ag1– (333.81 mAh g–1). Moreover, the composite electrode can still deliver a specific
capacity of about 97.4% of initial capacity after cycling at high
rates and returning to the initial current density of 0.1 A g1–.

Introduction
Looking forward to
the energy future of portable electronics and
hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), renewable energy will likely be the
most tolerable way to solve many feasibility and environmental problems.
Massive efforts have been made for satisfying the great challenge
of find a cheap and efficient way of storing the variable renewable
energy.

In the past two decades, LIBs have achieved great attention
because
of their relatively high energy density and long cycle lifetime.1−6 Therefore, the study of various electrode materials will be great
significant to develop LIBs with higher energy density, practical
reliability, and long cycle stability.7−8 Much research has been focused novel anode
materials for LIBs, involving carbon-based materials11,12 (because of their moderate high surface area, excellent electrical
conductivity, and appropriate power density), metal oxide anode materials13,14 (because of their high specific capacity), and intermetallic metal
anode materials.15,16 Despite some encouraging progress,
the specific capacity of these materials is still low (less than 1000
mAh g–1) and the cycling life is poor and also kinetics
of Li-ion and electron transport in electrodes and the interface of
electrode/electrolyte is slow.17−18

One of the strategies to
overcome these limitations may be using
of hybrid nanomaterials. Combination of chemically distinguished materials
with their frank characteristics can be a hybrid nanostructure. Separate
restrictions or benefits of hybrid nanomaterial dependent to how to
control the assembly, fabrication of the constitution, and type of
architecture. Hybrid nanocomposite, because of its synergistic effects
of components and multifunctionality, can present desired properties
and enhanced performance.

Recently, elemental phosphorus (P)
has been demonstrated as a particularly
attractive anode material for LIBs due to its high theoretical capacity
(2595 mAh g–1, assuming a complete reaction).20,21 Between different allotropes of P, red P (RP) received much interest
as a good candidate for anode materials in LIBs because of its chemical
stability at room temperature and atmosphere. In comparison with other
allotropes, RP is commercially available with ease, safe, and abundant.26−23 Nevertheless, this battery performance is still unsatisfactory due
to its volume expansion effects (∼300% during Li+ insertion/extraction that may cause poor electrical contact, pulverization
of particles and continuous growth of the solid electrolyte interphase
(SEI)) and low electron conductivity (∼1 × 10–14 S/cm making the electrochemical redox reaction difficult) the experimental
capacity is limited.28−,22

Lee’s group was one doing pioneering research on P
anodes
through the high-energy BM of red phosphorus and carbon black.26 Apparently, the results showed that electrochemical
performance in LIBs can be improved through a composite of electrically
conductive carbon matrix with phosphorus. However, different strategies
presented for generating robust phosphorus–carbon (P–C)
bonds between RP and a variety of carbon materials, including single-walled
carbon nanotube composite,30 graphite,29 graphene,31 and reduced
graphene oxide.32 Recently, Yu and co-workers
have designed a self-supported and flexible electrode by loading crystalline
red P into the porous carbon nanofibers for LIBs with high specific
capacity and excellent electrochemical cycling (∼2030 mAh g–1 at 0.1C rate after 100 cycles). The improvement in
electrochemical performance of this design is attributed to the special
structure design, in which the carbon nanofibers matrix has a distinctive
rule due to its good conductivity and easy access of ions.33 On the basis of our extensive research, we believed
that to fabricate a novel structure as an anode material that can
show good performance, the nanoporosity and downsizing of introducing
active materials to the electrode is critical. On the other side,
in an interesting study, Zhang and co-workers reported the advantages
of reinforced concrete RP/TiO2 composites for LIBs in consideration
of achieving complementary effects.34 In
such a composite, TiO2 with high safety and outstanding
stability but low capacity act as concrete, whereas RP with high capacity
plays the role steel. Their designed unique reinforced concrete structure
due to synergistic effect of RP and A-TiO2 presented an
enhanced cycling capacity of 369 mAh g–1 over 100
cycles as well as an acceptable rate capacity of 202 mAh g–1 at the current density of 1 A g–1.

However,
these pioneering results inspired us to combine the above-mentioned
strategies and use RP accompanying a combination of metal oxides (Co3O4 and CuO) to acquire a novel structure with appropriate
electric connection and improved electrochemical performance. In this
work, we attempted to propose a novel RP/Co3O4–CuO hybrid nanostructure for LIBs to unexpectedly achieve
highly capacity in high current density through incorporation a reasonable
value of RP inside Co3O4–CuO nanoparticles
during BM (ball milling) process. However, to the best of our knowledge,
there have not been any reports on RP/Co3O4–CuO
hybrid nanomaterial as anode for LIBs. Particularly, the facility
of the provision process and high capacity returning after cycling
at high rates (97.4%), which is based on the composite (RP + Co3O4–CuO), are likely to make a great impact
in the research on LIBs. On the one hand, rational value of RP is
not an obstacle for electric conductive material and this logical
amount effectively enhanced the power density and capacity of lithium
ions. It means RP reinforcement stored local effect of Co3O4. Seemingly, this enhanced capacity in high current
density especially is because of presence RP with different electronegativity
that can break the electroneutrality of Co3O4–CuO to create the relative charged sites which are favorable
and improve the discharge and charge capacity of Co3O4–CuO in LIBs.35,36 Furthermore, CuO nanoparticles
act as robust conductive backrest to maintain and boost the overall
conductivity in the total hybrid and also plays a barrier role for
preventing particle aggregation and enhancing the material’s
tolerance of the large volume change of phosphorus and Co3O4 during volume expansion/contraction. The electrochemical
performances of the Co3O4–CuO and RP/Co3O4–CuO nanocomposites were assessed as an
anode material for LIBs. The result of unique compositions (RP/Co3O4–CuO hybrid structure) showed the offered
strategy could provide an effective and facile technique for improving
the cycling stability (470.11 mAh g–1 after 60 cycles
at a density of 1.0 Ag–1) with a high rate discharge
capacity of 333.81 mAh g–1 at a current density
of 3 A g–1. Figure 1 shows a schematic illustration of RP/Co3O4–CuO hybrid that was prepared through a facile
and simple BM process.

nanohybrid.

Results and Discussion
The phase’s distinction and also crystallinity of samples
were studied by XRD. Figure 2 presented XRD patterns of Co3O4–CuO
and RP/Co3O4–CuO hybrid. In the XRD pattern
of RP/Co3O4–CuO, the characteristic (111),
(220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511), and (440) reflections of
crystal faces of the cubic phase Co3O4 (JCPDS
no. 42–1467, space group: Fd3m) and also the diffraction peaks
due to CuO [indexed to (002), (111), (20–2) and (11–3)
planes (JPCDS: 48–1548)] are apperceived. After infiltrating
RP into Co3O4–CuO, in comparison to Co3O4–CuO, a diffraction peak at 15° of
RP/Co3O4–CuO appears, which is correspond
to RP structure.37 Also, the average crystallite
sizes corresponding to RP/Co3O4–CuO sample,
increasing from 14.73 to 21.02 nm compared to Co3O4–CuO after introduction of RP. Because the average
particle size corresponding to the RP/Co3O4–CuO
sample, after introduction of RP, increased only 6.29 nm compared
to Co3O4–CuO, it can be deduced that
nanosized RP has been successfully introduced into the lattice of
the Co3O4–CuO nanoparticle. In the other
words, if the particle size of RP was not nanosized, the lattice of
the Co3O4–CuO nanoparticle would be more
expansive after incorporation with RP during the BM (ball milling)
process.

Figure 2 XRD pattern of Co3O4–CuO and RP/Co3O4–CuO samples.

However, RP was sustained in our Co3O4–CuO
nanocomposite by application of BM, which is well-known as a controlled
technique that produces nanosized particles at room temperature. However,
we could not directly determine the particle size of RP, but by using
the Scherrer equation (D = kλ/βcos
θ, where D is the particle size in nanometers,
λ is the wavelength of the radiation (1.54056 Å for CuKa
radiation), k is a constant equal to 0.94, β
is the peak width at half-maximum intensity and θ is the peak
position) and the difference between the particle size of RP/Co3O4–CuO and Co3O4–CuO,
we could assess the particle size of RP, which is about 6.3 nm.

FT-IR was utilized to further investigate interaction between RP
nanopowders and Co3O4–CuO nanostructures
and also to analyze bonding of materials. Figure 3 shows the FT-IR spectra of Co3O4–CuO and RP/Co3O4–CuO
nanoparticles in the 450–2500 cm–1. As shown
in Figure 3b, the peaks
for the RP/Co3O4–CuO hybrid in the region
of 564 and 660 cm–1 shows characteristic absorption
bonds of Co–O and Cu–O vibration which is attributed
to Co3O4 and CuO, respectively.38 Interestingly, after impregnation of RP nanopowders into
Co3O4–CuO nanoparticles, the peaks intensity
at 564 and 660 cm–1 that related to Co3O4 and CuO were decreased. From these intensity changes
of peaks in the RP/Co3O4–CuO composites
can be understood RP nanopowders exist in pores of Co3O4–CuO nanocomposite. Also, when RP/Co3O4–CuO hybrid exposed to air, a thin layer of phosphorus–based
oxides because of oxidation is obviously observed.27 This layer is acknowledged by reflection of a absorption
peak around 1619 cm–1 is corresponded to the P=O
and P–O.39 Moreover, another new
peak centered at 1097 cm–1 appears in the FT-IR
spectra of the RP/Co3O4–CuO nanohybrid
in comparison with Co3O4–CuO nanostructure,
suggesting the formation of M (Co/Cu)-O-RP bonds during BM. Nevertheless,
because of the detection of some peaks related to the several types
of phosphate at this binding energy, it cannot be referred to certainly
represented M (Co/Cu)-O-RP bonding. But, it can be expected that M-O-RP
bonding occurs around this region.40,41 This chemical
interaction induced by bonding between Co3O4–CuO nanoparticles and RP nanopowders increases the capacitance
and prevents the loss of electrical contact during electrochemical
performance.

and
(b) RP/Co3O4–CuO nanocomposites.

The morphologies of Co3O4–CuO and
RP/Co3O4–CuO nanopowders were investigated
by FE-SEM as shown in Figures 4a, b. Both samples have almost similar morphology and show
nearly spherical particles. Interestingly, they also synthesized with
a narrow size distributions of diameters ranging from 18 to 22 nm
(Figures 4a, b). But
in the appearance, the external surface of RP/Co3O4–CuO nanohybrids are rougher than the external surface
of Co3O4–CuO nanostructures. After impregnation
of RP, the size distribution of diameters of RP/Co3O4–CuO (Figure 4b) remains unchanged in compared with Co3O4–CuO, indicating that most of RP has been successfully
encapsulated in pores of Co3O4–CuO. By
limiting RP into Co3O4–CuO, diminishes
deterioration on electrode materials and enhancements volume capacity.
It is believed CuO nanoparticles have a vital role to preserve electric
contact between particles and also intercept restacking of Co3O4 nanoparticles during electrochemical behavior.
On the other hand, pores of Co3O4–CuO
prevent excessive volume expansion of RP during cycling. As a result,
this new nanohybrid supplies flexibility to accommodate the volume
change of RP particles, reduce the direct contact between RP and electrolyte
during Li-insertion/extraction reactions and consequence delivers
a limited SEI construction.

and (b) RP/Co3O4–CuO composite. TEM micrograph
of (c) Co3O4–CuO and (d) RP/Co3O4–CuO composite.

TEM images were employed to get a deep understanding into
the detail
nanostructure and also further investigate the morphology of nanocomposites. Figure 4c, d shows the TEM
images of Co3O4–CuO and RP/Co3O4–CuO nanoparticles, respectively. It can be seen
that the particles size of Co3O4–CuO
nanostructures were about 10 nm, whereas RP/Co3O4–CuO was up to about 25 nm in size. The particle sizes obtained
by TEM were in good agreement with SEM results. TEM images showed
that the surface of RP/Co3O4–CuO nanohybrids
are rougher than the surface of Co3O4–CuO
nanoparticles. Because, after BM, the particle size of Co3O4–CuO did not change significantly in RP/Co3O4–CuO, it can be deduced that most RP has
been infiltrated in Co3O4–CuO nanocomposites.
This kind of impregnated structure in RP/Co3O4–CuO enhances capacity value by using of Co3O4–CuO and RP and generates numerous sites to Li-insertion/extraction,
whereas it remains electrically conductive because of the presence
of CuO between Co3O4 and RP.

By EDX analysis,
the distribution of individual elements in the
nanocomposites can be demonstrated. As shown in Figure 5a, the EDX spectrum shows the presence of
Co (56.03 wt %), Cu (29.93 wt %) and O (14.04 wt %) elements in Co3O4–CuO nanostructure and the chemical elements
of Co (43.52 wt %), Cu (32.96 wt %), O (11.29 wt %), and P (12.23
wt %) can be identified in Figure 5b, which are in good accordance with used weight ratio
in their synthesis. The EDX results approved the successful synthesis
of the Co3O4–CuO and RP/Co3O4–CuO nanomaterials as anode in lithium-ion battery.

and (b) RP/Co3O4–CuO nanohybrid.

To determine the BET surface area
and the corresponding BJH pore
size distribution curves, nitrogen adsorption and desorption were
measured. Figure 6 demonstrates
the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm and pore size distribution
of the two composite samples. The adsorption isotherm of both Co3O4–CuO (Figure 6a) and RP/Co3O4–CuO
(Figure 6c) are basically
similar in shape, which are a typical type IV with a hysteresis loop,
showing the mesoporous structure.42 In
comparison RP/Co3O4–CuO with Co3O4–CuO, adsorbed less N2 indicating
less specific surface and less pore volume. However, BET surface area
and total pore volume are decreased from 32.1 m2/g and
0.1644 cm3/g in Co3O4–CuO
nanostructure to 5.42 m2/g and 0.0264 cm3/g
in RP/Co3O4–CuO hybrid nanocomposite
(Figures 6a and 6c). The results suggest that nonporous RP powder
filled into the pores of Co3O4–CuO nanoparticles
and blocked partially those pores. The infiltration and intimation
contact of RP with Co3O4–CuO nanoparticles
during BM leads to the decrease of BET surface area and total pore
volume. Also, the BJH pore size (Figures 6b, d) distribution confirmed typical mesopores
structures of these composites with shown pores ranges from 2 to 40
nm. All the above-mentioned findings are in good agreement with SEM
and TEM results.

(b) pore
size distribution for Co3O4–CuO nanostructure.

distribution for RP/Co3O4–CuO nanohybrid.

To scrutinize the influence of
using RP on the behavior of electrochemical
rate capability of the Co3O4–CuO, we
carried out CV. The comparison of typical CV curves (at the 3st) of
Co3O4–CuO and RP/Co3O4–CuO electrodes was performed (Figure 7a). As can be seen, both electrodes have
similar electrochemical behavior, which confirmed the electrochemical
reduction/oxidation reactions in any two electrodes accompany lithiation
and delithiation. Although the potential anodic and cathodic peaks
for Co3O4–CuO are sharper and narrower
than peaks of RP/Co3O4–CuO, and the potential
anodic and cathodic peaks for RP/Co3O4–CuO
shift to the side potential, interestingly, the potential separation
between the anodic and cathodic peaks for the RP/Co3O4–CuO hybrid composite (about 0.68 V) is lower than
those of Co3O4–CuO (about 0.79 V). These
broad redox peaks of RP/Co3O4–CuO hybrid
composite can be assigned to the presence of RP and its contribution
to enhancing the capacity. So, all three components (Co3O4, CuO, and RP) can be contributed to improvement of
total capacity. It is expected that added RP (although has insulator
property) due to its reasonable amount in composite, reinforce the
Co3O4 with increasing capacity through produce
different sites and also amplified electrochemical behavior of Co3O4–CuO composites. Apparently, can be said
the synergies and strengthening effect of conductive network and porous
architecture of Co3O4–CuO and RP powders,
are very important to improvement of electrochemical behavior of RP/Co3O4–CuO hybrid composite.

nanohybrid electrodes; (b) first-third CV curves of the RP/Co3O4–CuO electrode, CVs were recorded at a

at a current density of 50 mAg–1.

Figure 7b shows
the first-third CV curves of the RP/Co3O4–CuO
electrode within the potential window of 0.02–3 V (vs Li+/Li). In the cathodic process, there is one broad peak located
at 0.58–1.1 V, belonging to the reduction of Co3O4 to Co, CuO to Cu and the formation of Li2O and a SEI layer.43−44 Of course, the broad of the peak at 1.2–1.6
V range was decreased in the latter scans, and is most likely due
to the electrochemical decomposition of electrolyte during the formation
of a SEI film on the RP/Co3O4–CuO electrode
surface.40,46 This observation implies that SEI formation
occurs mainly during the first cycle and is the irreversible capacity
loss. Of course, in the cathodic scan in addition to reaction of Co3O4, CuO, and SEI, there are reactions corresponding
to lithium ion insertion and formation of LixP (x = 1–3).47 In the anodic scan, there are reactions that correspond to the stepwise
delithiation process from lithium insertion state to extraction state
of P. It is worth noting that the peaks of the lithium/delithiation
process related to reaction of RP with Li ion also were detected in
other RP/carbon material electrodes.47,48

In addition
to this, in the broad peak located at around 1.7–2.4
V, there are reactions corresponding to the reversible oxidation of
metallic Co to Co3O4, Cu to CuO, and decomposition
of SEI.49,50 However, distinguishing between the anodic/cathodic
peaks of Co3O4, CuO and RP is difficult because
of their overlap. All of these observed peaks can be associated with
the lithiation and delithiation of components, showing that each of
them has a relative contribution to the total capacity. Moreover,
the anodic/cathodic peak locations were also detected in subsequent
scans and almost fixed in latter cycles, revealing that the RP/Co3O4–CuO composite has appropriate redox reversibility,
small polarization, and good electron conductivity. It should be noted
that, more proper ion diffusion pathway and better contact area is
obtained by linking CuO to Co3O4 in Co3O4–CuO. In other words, CuO facilitates the charge
transfer and conduction from the electrode/electrolyte. Furthermore,
RP has a synergistic effect on the electrochemical properties of the
hybrid composites by improving site access for Li ion. So, we can
expect a superiorly of RP/Co3O4–CuO to
Co3O4–CuO on the other electrochemical
behaviors.

The electrochemical lithium storage properties of
samples were
evaluated by galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements. Figure 7 c, d shows the first,
second and third-cycle galvanostatic charge/discharge profile of Co3O4–CuO and RP/Co3O4–CuO composites at a current density of 50 mAg–1 in the voltage range of 0.02–3.0 V (versus Li+/Li). The Co3O4–CuO sample delivers
initial discharge and charge capacity of 1067 and 1043.21 mAhg–1 respectively with a Coulombic efficiency of 97.7%,
meanwhile, the RP/Co3O4–CuO sample shows
initial discharge and charge capacity 1024.17 and 1022.12 mAhg–1 respectively with an extraordinary specifically Coulombic
efficiency of 99.8%. These interesting observations confirmed the
CV cures (Figure 7 b).

However, can be illustrated the mechanism of Li ion storage for
Co3O4–CuO and RP/Co3O4–CuO during the first discharge process as shown below:

The first:

For Co3O4:46 1  For CuO:44 2  And for RP20 that
is in RP/Co3O4–CuO: 3  And the second is formation of a SEI layer
with electrolyte decomposition. The significant Coulombic efficiency
and remain stable of Coulombic efficiency of RP/Co3O4–CuO compared with Co3O4–CuO
for first discharge and charge capacity is a promising sign of impregnated
RP into Co3O4–CuO. As can be seen, the
second and third cycles of RP/Co3O4–CuO
in Figure 7b followed
the same way, which confirmed the good stability and reversibility
of our new nanostructure for LIBs.

The Coulombic efficiency
of the RP/Co3O4–CuO
composite electrode for third-cycle is 99.7% whereas the Coulombic
efficiency of third-cycle for Co3O4–CuO
composite is 96%. For comparison, the initial Coulombic efficiency
of some electrodes such as nanostructured phosphorus composite,27 P/SWCNT mixture,30 crystalline red phosphorus incorporated with porous carbon nanofibers,33 and P@CMK-3,47 are
shown in Figure 8.
More importantly, the Coulombic efficiency of the RP/Co3O4–CuO for all three galvanostatic charge/discharge
cycles is almost equal. Nevertheless, the relatively less discharge
and charge capacity for ever cycle of RP/Co3O4–CuO compared with Co3O4–CuO,
can be related to the straight formation of SEI film on RP surface
which happens in some points of RP/Co3O4–CuO.
But in general, high specific Coulombic efficiency, high sustainability
of Coulombic efficiency, relative decline of hysteresis (ΔEV) between the discharge and charge plateaus
of RP/Co3O4–CuO nanoarray compared with
Co3O4–CuO nanocomposite can be attributed
to effective and reasonable presence of RP and created sites with
different electronegativity, sensible link of RP and Co3O4 with CuO in the electrode to keep electrical connection
between particles and presumably more uniform formation of the SEI
layer on the RP/Co3O4–CuO electrode.

Figure 8 Coulombic
efficiency comparison of various electrodes in literature.

Figure 9a, b presents
the cycling performance and discharge capacity versus cycle number
of the Co3O4–CuO and RP/Co3O4–CuO composites in the voltage range of 0.02
and 3 V at a current density of 0.1 and 1 A g–1.
Of course for better attitude, cycling performance at a current density
of 1 A g–1 for Co3O4, CuO,
and Co3O4–CuO nanostructure was investigated
in Figure S1. It can be seen that the capacity
drop of Co3O4 is very high, but for CuO, there
is less capacity with more relative stability. Compared with single
Co3O4 and CuO nanoparticles, Co3O4–CuO nanocomposite exhibited the highest stability
and appropriate capacity that attributed to a synergetic contribution
from CuO and Co3O4 nanoparticles and surface
modification of the nanocomposite. As depicted in Figure 9a, accompanied by the cycle
number increasing, the Co3O4–CuO electrode
delivers capacity retention around 60% of the initial capacity, which
can remain over 60 cycles at 0.1 A g–1 (637.35 mAh
g–1 at the 60th cycle). In contrast, the RP/Co3O4–CuO hybrid electrode shows a high capacity
of 683.63 mAh g–1 after 60 cycles while still keep
near 70% initial capacity (Figure 9b). It is interesting that at a current density of
1 A g–1, the RP/Co3O4–CuO
hybrid electrode can also deliver a high discharge capacity of 470.11
mAh g–1 even after 60 cycles, whereas the capacity
retention remains about 62.7%. Although, the initial discharge capacity
of Co3O4–CuO at 1 A g–1 in the first cycles was higher than the initial discharge capacity
of RP/Co3O4–CuO, but after 60 cycles,
the capacity reduced with a higher rate and reaches about 338.66 mAh
g–1 (44.8% capacity retention upon 60 cycles at
1 A g–1).

0.1 Ag1– and 1 Ag–1 of (a) Co3O4–CuO
nanostructure and (b) RP/Co3O4–CuO nanohybrid.
(c) Rate capability of Co3O4–CuO nanostructure
and RP/Co3O4–CuO nanohybrid at various
current densities.

However, Co3O4–CuO nanocomposite shows
higher initial discharge capacity in the first cycles (especially
in low current density) while the discharge capacity of RP/Co3O4–CuO hybrid electrode is more stable with
by the cycle number increasing. This phenomenon indicates the enhanced
effect of RP incorporating on the improved performance. The stable
capacity is likely due to RP, which creates a large number of topological
sites onto the Co3O4–CuO surface, which
directs the formation of a disordered nanostructure that better boosts
the discharge and charge capacity. It is worth noting that, after
RP nanopowder impregnation into Co3O4–CuO
nanostructure, electrical contact has been preserved on the electrode.
To the best of our knowledge, for first time RP/Co3O4–CuO composite is used as anode in lithium ion battery
and shows a good long-term cycling performance (>62% within 60
cycles)
with a high reversible capacity (>470.11 mAh g–1) that is an indication of promising application prospect. Figure S2 shows the effect of different amount
of RP (different mass ratio of Co3O4–CuO
to RP) on cycling stability at a current density of 0.1 A g–1 upon 60 cycles. Because of the low electrical conductivity of RP,
the low and rational amount of it was used in composite as anode material
in LIBs. According to Figure S2, when amount
of RP increases (or decreases the mass ratio of 20 until 6.7), capacity
is also increased in cycling performance after 60 cycles. But, in
more mass ratio of 6.7, because of high amount of RP and its negative
effective on electrochemical behavior, capacity is reduced remarkably.

For the material that is used as electrode, the rate capability
is a major factor when assessments for practical application. So,
the rate performance of Co3O4–CuO and
RP/Co3O4–CuO electrodes were examined
at different current density (0.1 to 3 A g–1). As
shown in Figure 9c,
with the gradually increased densities, Co3O4–CuO electrode delivered an average discharge capacities based
on the mass of the composite of 1060.79, 911.05, 790.19, 497.78, and
196.07 mAh g–1 at the current densities of 0.1,
0.2, 0.5, 1.0, and 3 A g–1, respectively. Although
for RP/Co3O4–CuO, the discharge capacity
based on composite were obtained 1035.99, 925.05, 857.39, 594.53,
and 333.81 mAh g–1 when the current densities increase
from 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 to 3.0 A g–1. For each stage,
the discharge process of the samples is compared for 10 cycles. It
should be noted that the capacities faded rapidly at higher currents.
It is clear that the RP/Co3O4–CuO hybrid
displays good long cycling behavior and also a much better discharge
capability than Co3O4–CuO electrode at
high current rate.

In addition, nearly 97.4% of the initial
discharge capacity can
be still recovered once the rate is restored to the initial 0.1 A
g–1 for RP/Co3O4–CuO,
which is higher than capacity returning of Co3O4–CuO (93.7% of initial discharge capacity) when recursion
to the initial 0.1 A g–1. This capacity retention
after cycling at high rates and possess high discharge capacity for
RP/Co3O4–CuO hybrid electrode demonstrating
the excellent Li storage properties and appropriate conductive electrode
between components and also indicating the novel structure by effective
embedding RP in Co3O4–CuO, which is a
promising strategy. It is believed that in RP/Co3O4–CuO electrode, Co3O4–CuO
nanoarray limits nanosized RP into its pores, leading to protect RP
from fracture and separation and also remain transport length of ions/electrons,
which eventually directed to higher storage capacities, good Coulombic
efficiencies, and suitable cycling stability.

We first studied
the conductivity of samples by four-probe technique.
The results are shown that conductivity of RP/Co3O4–CuO is about 1.21 S cm–1, which
is a little less conductive than Co3O4–CuO
(1.6 S cm–1). As expected, the addition of a reasonable
amount of RP cannot dramatically change the conductivity. However,
addition of a small amount RP can effectively increase capacity. Interestingly,
the conductivity of Co3O4 and CuO were low alone
(0.04 and 0.044 S cm–1 respectively), whereas for
the Co3O4–CuO nanocomposite, the conductivity
was improved because of the effective synergetic effect.

Then,
the EIS measurements were conducted to further investigate
the kinetic properties, the electronic conductivity and to better
understand the electrochemical behavior of RP/Co3O4–CuO nanohybrid electrode. For comparison, EIS measurements
of the Co3O4–CuO and RP/Co3O4–CuO were carried out and their Nyquist impedance
plots were recorded (Figure S3).

Nyquist plot as EIS displays the frequency response of the electrode/electrolyte
cell and in this diagram the real part of the impedance is plotted
on the X axis and the imaginary part is on the Y axis. The impedance curves of the electrode are consisted
of a single semicircle in the high-medium frequency region and an
inclined line at low frequency. In fact, in an equivalent circuit,
the semicircle at the Z real axis (Z′) reflects
ohmic resistance of the electrolyte and electric contact resistance
(Rs), whereas the semicircle in the high-middle
frequency range is related charge-transfer resistance at the interface
between the electrode and electrolyte (Rct), a constant phase element (Qc) denoted
the capacitance of the double layer and the willing line at low frequency
can be attributed to the Warburg impedance (Zw), which is represented by the ionic diffusion process within
the electrode.51

Figure S3 shows that, as expected, the
semicircle diameter of the Co3O4–CuO
and RP/Co3O4–CuO nanocomposite are almost
similar, but the slope line of the Co3O4–CuO
electrode is somewhat more vertical than the RP/Co3O4–CuO electrode. However, because of presence of RP,
this low difference of Warburg impedance is natural for RP/Co3O4–CuO. In addition, the simulated Nyquist
impedance plots and a suitable equivalent circuit of RP/Co3O4–CuO nanocomposite in different cycles was demonstrate
in Figure 10. As shown
in Figure 10, remaining
low value of semicircles of the hybrid composite after several cycles
at high frequency, stating suitable Li ion reaction and good electron
transport rate during the cycle test.

Figure 10 Nyquist plot and equivalent
circuit model of the RP/Co3O4–CuO nanohybrid
after 10, 20, and 30 cycles.
The frequency range and pulse amplitude applied were 100 kHz to 0.01
Hz and 5 mV, respectively; and inset at top shows the equivalent circuit
to fit the impedance data.

From the intercepts at the highest frequency of the curves
on the Z′, the Rs of the electrode
can be received. The Rs values for RP/Co3O4–CuO hybrid are about 10.0–20.0
Ω after 10, 20, and 30 cycles, indicating that the electrode
keeps its structure and morphology after cycling. Rct of cells with the nanohybrids after 10, 20, and 30
cycles are 312, 347, and 368 Ω, respectively. The Rct in the Nyquist plots corresponds with high frequency
semicircle. The resistance is slowly increased, indicates relatively
stable SEI layer and well-maintained electrical conductivity during
the initial cycles which is nearly stable after subsequent cycles.22,52 The formation of stable SEI can prevent capacity fading when nanohybrid
sustains consecutive expansion/contraction during cycling. On the
other hand, maintenance of the good electrical contact is beneficial
to rapid charge/discharge of composite, which confirmed by the good
rate performance as shown in Figure 9c.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we for
the first time successfully prepared a RP/Co3O4–CuO nanohybrid as an anode material in
LIBs through low cost sol–gel process and followed by simple
BM method. Due to the synergistic effect of Co3O4 and RP particles, the capacity of this electrode enhanced via increasing
different locations for adsorption Li ion in high current density.
On the other hand, CuO nanoparticles with their essential roles behave
as conductive matrix to sustain electrical contact between compounds
during insertion/extraction, buffer the enormous stress from the volume
expansion of the Co3O4 nanoparticles and also
assisted retain a stable SEI layer. This novel composite (RP/Co3O4–CuO) is given a Coulombic efficiency
of 99.8% for the first discharge and charge capacity at a current
density of 50 mA g–1, and shows good rate performance
of 683.63 and 470.11 mAh g–1 at current density
of 0.1 and 1.0 A g–1 after 60 cycles, respectively.
Even at high current density of 3 A g–1, the cycling
capacity is obtained 333.81 mAh g–1. Our results
suggest that because of the facile and low-cost synthesis, this novel
nanocomposite would be a promising candidate for practical application
as anode material of LIBs.

Experimental Setup
Fabrication of Co3O4–CuO Nanocomposite
The materials used
in the synthesis of Co3O4–CuO nanoparticles
were of analytical grade and were used
without any further purification. A typical sol–gel synthesis
of Co3O4–CuO with citric acid (as a chelating
agent) was performed the following way. First, cobalt acetate and
copper nitrate (Aldrich) (0.1/0.08 molar ratio) were dissolved in
ethylene glycol and citric acid (4:1, v/v) with the aid of ultrasonication
to obtain a sol then sonication was continued for 1 h to obtain a
gel. The resulting gelatin was heated at 160 °C for 12 h to form
a gel precursor. The obtain powder was calcined at 350 °C in
air then the product cooled in the furnace to room temperature.

Fabrication of RP/Co3O4–CuO Hybrid
Co3O4–CuO nanopowder (prepared in
former step) with Commercial RP (%99, Sigma-Aldrich) (1:0.15, weight
ratio) were placed in a stainless steel BM and sealed in a glovebox
under argon protection as protection gas, performed at 400 rpm for
20 h. BM is recently well introduced as a powerful and effective method
for the preparation of materials in nanoscale particles. It is believed
that in the BM process, large bulk RP is ground into nanopowder and
then confined in the pores of Co3O4–CuO
nanostructure. From this point of view, this new design of Co3O4–CuO nanoarray with its pores embedded
by nanosized RP can modify the expansion of RP after lithiation without
cracking Co3O4–CuO nanostructure. Furthermore,
all the construction is electrochemically active and provides good
transport kinetics for both electrons and ions.

Sample Characteristics
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD)
was performed by an Equinox 3000 with Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 0.15418 nm). The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the
products was studied using a JASCO FTIR spectrophotometer. The morphology
and structure of the powder samples were successfully studied by a
field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Mira 3-XMU) equipped
with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDS or EDX) to check the
chemical composition of the powders, and a transmission electron microscope
(TEM, Zeiss EM 900). The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms
were obtained by a porosimetry system and an accelerated surface area
(Belsorp mini II sorption analyzer) for determining the pore volume
and surface areas. The pore volume was calculated by Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) method and the surface area was calculated by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method.

Electrochemical Measurement
The
electrochemical measurements
of Co3O4–CuO and RP/Co3O4–CuO composites as anode materials in LIBs were conducted
by galvanostatic charge/discharge technique. The working electrode
was prepared by coating slurry containing 85 wt % active materials
(RP/Co3O4–CuO or Co3O4–CuO), 10 wt % ultrapure graphite (conductive agent,
purity >99.99 wt %) and 5 wt % PVDF (polyvinylidine fluride, as
a
binder) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as the dispersant
on copper foil. Then, the electrode was dried in a vacuum oven in
60 °C overnight before test. The typical active materials loading
of the electrodes sheet was about 2.5 mg/cm2. The coin
cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox, using lithium foil
as the counter and reference electrode, the polypropylene membrane
(Celgard 2400) as separator and a solution of 1 mol L–1 LiClO4 (battery grade, Aldrich) in propylene carbonate.
The galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were conducted on a battery
test system (Kimia stat-5 V/10 mA, kimia pardaz rayane, Iran) at various
densities with a cutoff voltage window of 0.05–3.0 V (vs Li+/Li). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) measurement tests were performed by a Galvanostat/Potantiostat
Autolab (PGSTAT 302N) and the CV test was carried out by applying
an excitation potential of 5 mV between 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz at a scan
rate 0.1 mV s–1.
