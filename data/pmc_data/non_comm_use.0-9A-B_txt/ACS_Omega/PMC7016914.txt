Self-assembling polyimides (PIs) having diketopiperazine
(DKP)
components were synthesized by polycondensation of a 4-amino-l-phenylalanine (4APhe) dimer, an aromatic diamine newly designed
in this study. The amino acid-derived PIs showed high thermal resistance,
with a 10% weight loss temperature (Td10) of 432 °C at the maximum, and did not show any glass transition
below the thermal decomposition temperature. The poly(amic acid) (PAA)
precursors formed nanospheres upon reprecipitation over dimethylacetamide
into water. The nanospheres were then added to solvents with different
polarities and sonicated to induce deformation of the spherical forms
into spiky balls, flakes, or rods. The PAA particle morphologies were
retained in the PIs after the two-step imidization. Finally, the PI
particles with self-assembling DKP moieties were formed, and their
morphologies were fine-tuned using different mixed solvents.

Introduction
The development of biobased polymers is
essential for establishing
a sustainable green society. Conventional biobased aliphatic polymers
such as polyesters1 and polycarbonates2 have unsatisfactory thermal and mechanical properties,
although several attempts have been made to improve these properties.3−9 One of the most effective strategies in this regard is to incorporate
an aromatic component into the polymer backbone.6,7,10−13

Polyimides (PIs), a class
of super-high-performance plastics, are
widely used in electronic devices and in aerospace applications because
of their outstanding mechanical durability and high thermal and chemical
stabilities, which enable them to tolerate harsh environments.14−18 PIs were initially synthesized from petrochemical-based monomers,
but there have been a few recent attempts to synthesize them from
biobased monomers.19−25 In particular, attempts have been made to prepare partial or completely
biobased PIs using a biobased aromatic diamine, 4,4′-diaminotruxillic
acid (4ATA), and various dianhydrides. 4ATA was synthesized by photodimerization
of the biobased 4-aminocinnamic acid (4ACA), an aromatic amino acid
obtained by the bioconversion of 4-aminophenylalanine (4APhe) using
phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), and a genetically engineered microorganism.19 With regard to molecular design, we found that
the alicyclic structure sandwiched between two aromatic rings imparted
rigidity to produce thermally resistant PIs with a Td10 value of 425 °C, while the glass transition temperature, Tg, was found to be 350 °C, while retaining
important functions, such as optical transparency, in the case of
4ATA. Despite the outstanding thermal stability, the low efficiency
of the bioconversion step using PAL reduced the yield of 4ACA significantly.
This motivated us to use 4APhe in the present study in order to eliminate
the inefficient bioconversion step involving PAL. If 4APhe is dimerized,
another aromatic diamine biomonomer can be synthesized.

In order
to synthesize a structure in which heterocyclic compounds
are sandwiched by two aromatic rings, we carried out the dimerization
of 4APhe and obtained a 2,5-diketopiperazine (2,5-DKP) derivative.
The core structure of several drugs contains central 2,5-DKP rings,26−28 but 2,5-DKP has not been extensively used as a building block to
synthesize functional polymeric materials.29−32 In the present study, we have
designed a monomer containing a centrosymmetric amide functionality
in the 2,5-DKP ring, apart from two aromatic rings that can induce
self-assembly of the corresponding polymer chains through hydrogen
bonding and π–π interactions.33−36 Particle formation can be expected
as a result of the chain self-assembly, rendering these PIs suitable
for applications such as fillers, heat resistant superhydrophobic
coatings,37 and ultralow-dielectric-constant
films.38

Here, we report the synthesis
of the biobased aromatic diamine
3,6-di(4-aminophenylmethyl)-2,5-diketopiperazine (DKP-4APhe) from
4APhe through a simple coupling of stepwise protection and deprotection.
The corresponding PIs having the 2,5-DKP heterocyclic structure in
the backbone are prepared by polycondensation with commercially available
aromatic dianhydrides. The present study investigates the particle
formation ability of the PIs and attempts to control their morphology
starting from a spherical form into various nonspherical shapes.

Results and Discussion
Monomer Syntheses
A biobased aromatic diamine including
a 2,5-DKP central core, DKP-4APhe, was synthesized by stepwise 4APhe
dimerization (see Scheme 1). First, the aromatic amine group in 4APhe was protected
by benzyl chloroformate (z-) to obtain 4APhe-z. Successive protections
of the carboxylic acid and α-amine groups were separately carried
out by methanol (methyl-) in the presence of trimethylsilyl chloride
(TMSCl) and by di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (Boc-) to
obtain methyl-4APhe-z and Boc-4APhe-z, respectively. The linear dipeptide
was then synthesized by amidation coupling of methyl-4APhe-z and Boc-4APhe-z
in the presence of condensation reagents. In the last step, Boc was
deprotected from the α-amine group, which was successively cyclized
by a reaction with methyl ester to form the central 2,5-DKP ring (total
yield; 29 wt %). It should be noted here that two other methods for
cyclodimerization had been tried. Cyclodimerization of 4APhe with
z-protection at aromatic amine was tried by heating at 170 °C
in ethylene glycol, but the reaction did not proceed. By cyclodimerization
using PCl5, 4APhe with z-protection at aromatic amine was
refluxed for 4 h in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and PCl5. Although
the reaction was carried out successfully, the purity of the obtained
product was not satisfactory enough to be used for polymerization.
As the polymerization requires high purity of monomers, an alternative
approach was applied for the synthesis of the DKP monomer.

Scheme 1 Synthesis
of a Biobased Aromatic Diamine Having a DKP Core, 3,6-Di(4-aminophenylmethyl)-2,5-DKP
(DKP-4APhe) from 4-Amino-l-phenylalanine (4APhe)
The structure of the aromatic diamine was confirmed
by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 13C
NMR, Fourier-transform
infrared (FTIR), and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)
analyses and was identical to the expected structure.

As a result
of cyclization, the 1H NMR signals of the
β-carbons of the 4APhe moieties (see Figure S1) shifted from 2.76–3.08 to 2.08 ppm, which coupled
with the proton signals of 2,5-DKP at 7.63 (−NH−) and
3.80 ppm (−CH−). The proton signal at 4.89 ppm was attributed
to the aromatic amine groups. The FTIR spectrum (Figure S2) showed N–H stretching, C=O stretching,
and N–H bending bands of the amide group at 3570–3310,
1656, and 1459 cm–1, respectively. C=C and
C–H stretching peaks of the aromatic ring manifested at 1516
and 3030–2870 cm–1, respectively. The formation
of DKP-4APhe was also confirmed by 13C NMR (see Figure S3) and FT-ion cyclotron resonance (ICR)-MS
(ESI) (see Figure S4). The observed signal
at m/z 347.14764 was consistent
with the calculated value 347.147642 for the species [M + Na]+.

Polymer Syntheses
Poly(amic acids) (PAAs), the precursors
of PIs, were prepared by polycondensation of the prepared diamine,
DKP-4APhe, with stoichiometric amounts of the dianhydrides, pyromellitic
dianhydride (PMDA), 3,3′,4,4′-benzophenonetetracarboxylic
dianhydride (BTDA), 4,4′-oxidiphthalic anhydride (OPDA), 3,3′,4,4′-diphenylsulfonetetracarboxylic
dianhydride (DSDA), 3,4,3′,4′-biphenyltetracarboxylic
dianhydride (BPDA), 1,2,3,4-cyclobutanetetracarboxylic dianhydride
(CBDA), and 5-(2,5-dioxotetrahydrofuryl)-3-methyl-3-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic
anhydride (DHCDA) (see Scheme 2). The resulting PAAs are abbreviated as PAA–PMDA,
PAA–BTDA, PAA–OPDA, PAA–DSDA, PAA–BPDA,
PAA–CBDA, and PAA–DHCDA, respectively, as shown in Table 1. The 1H NMR and FTIR spectra of all the PAAs are shown in Figures S5 and S6, respectively. In the 1H NMR
spectra of the PAAs, the main chain proton signals for the carboxylic
acid, amide, cyclic amide groups of DKP, and the aromatic diamine
group appeared at δ 12.2–13.2, 10.4–9.8, 8.1–7.9,
and 7.5–7.0 ppm, respectively. PAAs derived from the aromatic
dianhydrides, PMDA, BTDA, OPDA, DSDA, and BPDA, showed aromatic proton
signals at δ 8.3–7.1 ppm in addition to the abovementioned
peaks. On the other hand, PAAs derived from the aliphatic dianhydrides,
CBDA and DHCDA, showed signals corresponding to cyclobutane and methylcyclohexene
at δ 3.9–3.4 and 3.0–1.7 ppm, respectively. The
proton signal at 5.5 ppm was assigned to the double bond in DHCDA.

a Weight-average molecular weight, Mw, number-average molecular weight, Mn, and PDI of the dissolved PAA fraction in
LiBr/DMF were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC).

The dimethylacetamide (DMAc) solution of the PAAs
was used to prepare
PAAs films by casting on silicon wafers and evaporating the solvent
at 60–70 °C. The PIs were obtained via stepwise thermal
imidization by maintaining the temperature at 100, 150, and 200 °C
for 1 h each and at 250 °C for 3 h at each step in a vacuum oven.
The color of the PIs changed from yellow to dark brown, making them
darker than the PAAs. Figures S6 and S7 show the FTIR spectra of the PAAs and PIs, respectively. Figure S7 clearly indicates the imide ring formation,
as confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy. In all the samples, the following
peaks were observed: a broad band in the range 2500–3500 cm–1 (O–H stretching of carboxylate), two different
carbonyl peaks at 1714 cm–1 (C=O stretching
of carboxylate) and 1663 cm–1 (C=O stretching
of amide), respectively, apart from two peaks at 1514 and 1437 cm–1 (aromatic C–H). After stepwise heating, all
the annealed samples showed two carbonyl absorption peaks at 1712
cm–1 (C=O symmetric stretching) and at 1776
cm–1 (C=O asymmetric stretching), which were
attributed to imide rings. The appearance of new peaks at 1373 cm–1 (C–N stretching of imide) and 1150 cm–1 (imide ring deformation), coupled with the disappearance
of the characteristic amide peak, clearly indicates an imidization.

The solubilities of different polymers were investigated using
1 mg of samples in 1 mL of a specific solvent at two different temperatures:
20 and 60 °C. The PAAs were completely soluble in polar solvents
such as concentrated sulfuric acid, N-methylpyrrolidone,
DMAc, and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at room temperature and partially
in dimethylformamide (DMF). However, all the PIs were soluble only
in acidic solvents such as trifluoroacetic acid and concentrated sulfuric
acid.

The weight-average molecular weight (Mw), number-average molecular weight (Mn), and polydispersity index (PDI) were determined using
the PAAs
(see Table 1). The
PAAs had Mw and Mn values in the ranges of 16.8–33.2 and 24.9–14.7
× 103 kDa, respectively, while the PDI values ranged
from 1.1 to 1.4. Note that only the dissolved fraction in LiBr/DMF
was measured, in order to decrease the molecular weight and make the
distribution narrower.

Thermal Properties
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
was used in order to study the thermal degradation of the PIs in a
nitrogen atmosphere, using a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The 5
and 10% weight-loss temperatures, Td5 and Td10, were evaluated in each case. As shown in Table 2, all of the PIs exhibited Td10 values in the range 388–432 °C
and Td5 values in the range 365–420
°C, which indicated a high degree of resistance toward thermal
degradation. The PI derived from PMDA showed the highest Td10 value of 432 °C. In contrast, PI–DHCDA
showed the lowest Td10 value, presumably
because of the presence of fewer aromatic rings than the others, leading
to more susceptible chain scission at elevated temperatures. From
our previous research, the biopolyimides derived from 4ATA and PMDA,
both showed a Td10 value of 425 °C,19 which is lower compared to the values for the
PIs in the present study. The higher thermal resistance observed for
the PIs in this study can be attributed to the intermolecular forces
from the DKP moieties.

a 5 and 10% weight loss temperatures, Td5 and Td10, were
obtained from TGA curves scanned at a heating rate of 10 °C/min
under a nitrogen atmosphere.

The thermal transition behavior of the PIs was investigated
by
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under a nitrogen atmosphere.
There were no distinct peaks or points of inflections below the thermal
degradation temperatures for all the PIs investigated here, presumably
because of high glass transition temperatures. The hydrogen bonding
interactions between the imide group and DKP ring or between DKP moieties
could contribute to the high thermal stability of these compounds.

Particulation
The self-assembly behavior of the synthesized
polymers was investigated. The polymers synthesized in this study
have a DKP six-membered ring with two amide groups and other sites
such as the amide and acid groups and the aromatic ring, all of which
can trigger various noncovalent interchain interactions.

Here,
the PAA nanoparticles with narrow size distribution (see Table S1 and Figure S8) were formulated according to the solvent displacement technique
with surfactant-assisted cooperative self-assembly.39,40 The PAAs derived from DKP-4APhe diamine with a series of dianhydrides,
PMDA, BTDA, DSDA, and CBDA were taken for self-assembly (PAA–PMDA,
PAA–BTDA, PAA–DSDA, and PAA–CBDA, respectively).

Typically, a preformed PAA polymer solved in DMAc, a water-miscible
solvent, was slowly introduced drop by drop to an aqueous phase containing
Triton X-100 as the emulsifier under vigorous magnetic stirring. After
adding the organic phase into the watery phase, a slight turbidity
could be observed. The PAA surfactant in water formed aggregated structures
with a hydrophilic exterior and a hydrophobic interior. Subsequent
self-assembly was initiated by the fast diffusion of the organic solvent
(DMAc) into the aqueous medium, which progressively enriched the concentration
of the polymers in emulsion droplets. To counteract the loss of the
configurational entropy, cooperative noncovalent interactions of PAA
chains and polymer self-assembly were induced within surfactant aggregates
giving rise to uniform nanoparticles.41 The zeta potentials of the prepared PAA particles, as measured by
dynamic light scattering (DLS), indicate that the surfaces of all
particles were negatively charged, irrespective of the nature of the
dianhydride (see Table S2). This result
suggests that the carboxyl groups in each PAA are self-arranged on
the exterior surface of particles, which would help stabilize the
dispersion in the aqueous colloidal system.

Figure 1 shows changes
in the hydrodynamic diameter, Dh, of PAA–BTDA
particles as a function of PAA concentration and Triton X-100 concentration.
The PAA particles with the smallest hydrodynamic size of 110 nm were
formed at a PAA concentration of 0.5 wt %. A monotonous increase in Dh with an increase in PAA concentration can
be clearly seen in Figure 1a. When a dilute solution of the PAA was dropped into stirred
surfactant solution, nucleation and growth was initiated. The increased
concentration resulted in the formation of large particles by enhanced
growth. In contrast, when a very dilute PAA solution (lower than 0.5
wt %) was used, it was impossible to evaluate the particle size by
either DLS or scanning electron microscopy (SEM) because the particle
yield was very low. Conversely, when the PAA concentration was higher
than 6 wt %, precipitation occurred macroscopically immediately after
dropping the PAA solution. To summarize, the concentration range between
0.5 and 6 wt % was found to be suitable in order to obtain well-dispersed
and size-controlled PAA particles.

Figure 1 Hydrodynamic diameter, Dh, of PAA–BTDA
particles measured by DLS. (a) Dh dependence
on the polymer concentration under a constant Triton X-100 concentration
of 1 wt %. (b) Dh dependence on the Triton
X-100 concentration under a constant polymer concentration of 4 wt
%.

Figure 1b shows
a decrease in Dh with an increase in the
concentration of Triton X-100, from 0.1 to 3.0 wt %. The surfactant
plays an important role because it can retard the aggregation of the
droplets by lowering the surface tension. A higher amount of the surfactant
made the droplet smaller because a large surface area could be stabilized.
In solutions with very low concentrations of Triton X-100 (lower than
0.1 wt %), DLS was unable to supply the particle size data, indicating
that there was very little surfactant to stabilize the polymer droplets,
which resulted in aggregation. The size distribution of the PAA particles
was the lowest when the concentration of the PAA and Triton X-100
were 4 and 1 wt %, respectively, suggesting that this range of concentrations
should be used for investigating factors that could control particle
morphologies.

To convert the PAAs to PI particles, we employed
a two-step imidization,
chemical imidization using a pyridine/acetic anhydride mixture (1:1
mole ratio), followed by stepwise thermal imidization. The characteristic
peaks of the imide ring which appeared at 1781 and 1713 cm–1 in the FTIR spectrum (see Figure S9)
confirmed the conversion. In addition, the peak at 1373 cm–1 corresponding to the C–N imide stretching and the peak at
712 cm–1 corresponding to the bending of C–N
also appeared. After the two-step imidization, spherical nanosized
PIs were formed with diameters of 309 ± 38, 471 ± 110, and
499 ± 171 nm for PI–BTDA, PI–CBDA, and PI–DSDA,
respectively, which are in good agreement with the hydrodynamic diameters
measured by DLS (see Figure 2, Table S1). The morphology of
PI–PMDA in the SEM image was not as clear as that of the other
samples because of particle agglomeration and the formation of irregular
particle clusters [but DLS indicates a Dh of 780 nm (Table S1)]. Because of imide
formation, no net repulsion is expected between PI particles, allowing
for an increased particle size, as confirmed by DLS (see Table S1).

DKP-4APhe with various
dianhydrides (a) BTDA, (b) CBDA, (c) DSDA, and (d) PMDA.

Figure 3 shows the
results of TGA measurements for the PI nanoparticles. The data demonstrate
that the thermal behavior of the two-step imidized PI nanospheres
is comparable to that of PIs with a 5% weight loss approximately at
400 °C in most cases (see Table 2), indicating a high thermal resistance.

recorded under a nitrogen atmosphere.

Morphology Control
Particle morphologies of DKP-based
PIs were controlled by external stimuli, namely, variation of the
solvent polarity. After collecting the PAA microspheres from aqueous
medium by centrifugation, they were redispersed in three solvent systems,
acetone/water mixture, methanol/water mixture, and cyclohexane, followed
by sonication for 5 h. Figure 4 shows SEM images of the PAA–BTDA particles after treatment
by different solvents, clearly revealing morphology changes. When
20% acetone/80% water mixture was used, microparticles such as spiky
balls were formed (8.6 ± 1.0 μm) (see Figure 4a). The spiky ball can be regarded
as consisting of secondary aggregates, with needles on their surface.
We propose that the needles could be formed as a result of interchain
self-assembly via DKP interactions. When the proportion of acetone
was changed in the mixed solvent, the secondary aggregates were formed
but needles were formed to some extent only at two compositions, with
10 and 50% acetone (see Figure S10a2,a3, respectively). The introduction of PAA nanospheres into a less
polar solvent, such as acetone/water mixed solvent, seemed to induce
polymer aggregation, with a consequent increase in the particle size.
Under sonication, the polymers could rearrange themselves into more
highly ordered structures. It is possible that the solvent polarity
may be fine-tuned to cause the formation of needle-like structures
on the secondary aggregate surfaces. When a 40% methanol/60% water
mixture was used, rod-like microparticles, whose lengths ranged from
10 to 60 μm (with aspect ratios ranging from 1 to 6), were formed.
The volumes of the rods were much higher than those of the pretreated
spheres, and this is attributed to efficient self-assembly by using
the mixed solvent (methanol/water) of the right polarity. The rod
content in a SEM image seemed to be related to the proportion of methanol
in the mixed solvent (see Figure S10b1,b2). This suggests that when PAA spheres were plasticized by an appropriate
composition of methanol/water, the PAA chains were able to self-assemble
efficiently to form the rods.

Figure 4 SEM images of PAA–BTDA obtained by redispersion
of PAA spheres
into (a1) 20% acetone/water, (b1) 40% methanol/water, and (c1) cyclohexane,
following sonication and conversion to PI by two-step imidization
as given in (a2,b2,c2), respectively.

When cyclohexane was used as a solvent, flake-like
microparticles
were formed. If the PAA was partially dissolved in cyclohexane under
ultrasonication, the brittle and thin film formed was cast over cyclohexane
solution and appeared to be flake-like particles. After the two-step
imidization, the PAA particle morphologies were still maintained in
the corresponding PIs (see Figure 4a2,b2,c2). The morphology of the PI particles was then
fine-tuned by the use of mixed solvents of different polarities.

The self-assembly was investigated in terms of hydrogen bonding
by FTIR techniques. Figure 5b shows the FTIR spectrum of the PI–BTDA spherical
particles obtained by solvent displacement and subsequent imidization,
showing five specific vibrations at 1780, 1718, 1667, 1516, and 1375
cm–1, which were assigned to C=O of benzophenone,
C=O of the imide ring (imide I), C=O stretching of DKP
(amide I), N–H bending of DKP (amide II), and C–N of
imide (imide II), respectively. The FTIR peaks of the spiky balls
were not very different from those of the spheres (see Figure 5c), although the C=O
of the imide ring showed a slight shift toward higher wavenumbers.
The absence of any significant change of the FTIR spectrum suggests
that there is no distinct change in the hydrogen bonding patterns
during the morphology conversion from spheres to spiky balls. Although
the transformation from a smooth to a spiky surface could have resulted
from an enhancement in hydrogen bonding, the percentage change was
too small. On the other hand, rods formed by the methanol/water stimulus
showed the broadening of amide I, as well as the red shifts of amide
II, C=O of benzophenone, and imide II peaks, clearly indicating
the enhanced hydrogen bonding in stacked polymer chains36,42 via DKP interactions, even after imidization (see Figure 5d). Regarding the flakes formed
by the cyclohexane stimulus, the blue shifts of amide I and imide
I were observed (see Figure 5a), which implied that the hydrogen bonds became weaker after
drying over cyclohexane. The IR analyses support the notion of solvent
casting of particles to be film-like structures.

Figure 5 FTIR spectra of PI–BTDA
in various forms: (a) flakes, (b)
spheres, (c) spiky balls, and (d) rods.

The solvent effects for the previously reported19 PAA–BTDA particles, derived from 4ATA
dimethyl ester,
were investigated for comparison. 4ATA dimethyl ester is a diamine
monomer having a central cyclobutane ring sandwiched by aromatic rings
similar to DKP-4APhe monomers, but having no amide linkage which makes
it different from DKP. The particle morphologies were observed by
SEM (see Figure S11). Although spherical
particles (605 ± 157 nm) were obtained by the solvent displacement
method (Figure S11a), particles were broken
into diffuse shapes after redispersion into solvent mixtures of 20%
acetone/80% water, 40% methanol/60% water, and cyclohexane, following
sonication (Figure S11b–d, respectively).
This suggests that DKP units could play a key role in the solvent-assisted
morphological change in the present PAA and PI systems. Thus, the
thermoresistant biopolyamide particles have the ability to transform
into different shapes by the external stimuli of solvent exchange,
and the morphology change can help to add to their functionality.
This could in turn increase the number of possible applications for
such molecules, for example, as fillers reinforcing a polymer matrix.

Conclusions
We synthesized the aromatic diamine, 3,6-di(4-aminophenylmethyl)-2,5-DKP
(DKP-4APhe), by cyclic dipeptide formation of a functionalized α-amino
acid, 4APhe, where the 2,5-DKP ring can induce self-assembly because
of its centrosymmetric cyclic amide groups. DKP-4APhe was polymerized
with various dianhydrides to obtain biobased PAAs, which were converted
into PIs with high thermal resistance. Among all the PI molecules
in the present study, the PI from PMDA showed the highest Td10 of 432 °C. In addition, its Tg value could not be estimated, presumably because
it is higher than the temperature at which the PI decomposes. Using
the simple solvent displacement method from DMAc into water, PAA and
PI spheres having smooth surfaces were formed. The PAA spheres underwent
morphological changes into spiky ball-, rod-, or flake-like particles
upon varying the solvent polarity using an acetone/water mixture,
methanol/water mixture, or cyclohexane, respectively. The morphology
observed at the PAA stage was retained in the PI particles, even after
the two-step imidization. FTIR analyses indicated that hydrogen bonding
was enhanced in the rod-like particles, presumably because of the
self-assembly of the DKP moiety. To summarize, biobased PI particles
with high thermal resistance were prepared, which can be potentially
used as fillers for reinforcing aromatic polymer matrixes. Indeed,
nonspherical particle morphologies may enhance filler–matrix
interactions.

Kanto Chemical) and pyridine (anhydrous >99.5% from Kanto Chemical)
were used for chemical imidization as received. A surfactant used
for particle formation, Triton X-100 (from Acros), was used as received.
Solvents such as 2-butanol (>99.0% from Kanto Chemical), acetic
acid
(AcOH: >99.7% from Kanto Chemical), N,N-DMAc (DMAc: >99.8% anhydrous from Kanto Chemical),

Measurements
1H NMR and 13C NMR
were performed on a Bruker BioSpin AG 400 MHz spectrometer using DMSO-d6 as a solvent at 23.1 °C with 16 accumulation
scans, using the proton resonance of residual nondeuterated DMSO as
an internal standard (2.55 ppm). The FTIR spectra were recorded with
a PerkinElmer Spectrum One spectrometer between 4000 and 400 cm–1 using a diamond-attenuated total reflection (ATR)
accessory. The number-average molecular weight (Mn), weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and the molecular weight distribution (PDI, Mw/Mn) were determined
by gel permeation chromatography (GPC; Shodex GPC-101, concentration
0.7 g/L, 10 mM LiBr/DMF eluent) equipped with a JASCO RI-2031 Plus
Intelligent RI detector and JASCO UV-2075 Plus Intelligent UV/Vis
detector after calibration with polystyrene standards. The mass spectra
were measured using a FT-ICR MS (Solarix) equipped with a Nanospray
source operating in the nebulizer-assisted ESI mode used in the positive
ion mode and scanned from m/z 50
to m/z 1000. TGA and DSC were carried
out by Seiko Instruments SII, SSC/5200 and Seiko Instruments SII,
X-DSC7000T, respectively, at a heating rate of 5 °C/min under
a nitrogen atmosphere. The remaining solvent and absorbed moisture
in polymer samples were removed at 250 °C for 1 h before TGA
and DSC measurement. PAA and PI particle morphologies were characterized
with a scanning electron microscope (JCM-6000Plus Versatile Benchtop
SEM). To prepare a sample, a droplet of the dispersion liquid (5 μL)
was casted on a glass slide and air-dried at room temperature; the
glass slide was fixed on the sample holder using double-faced carbon
tape and coated with a thin layer of gold with a sputter coater (Magnetron
sputter MSP-1S). The SEM instrument was operated at an acceleration
voltage of 15 kV and an emission current of 10 μA. ImageJ software
was used to analyze average particle diameters from the SEM images.
The hydrodynamic size and zeta potential were measured with DLS (Zetasizer
Nano ZS90). The calculation of size distribution from light scattering
measurements is based on the assumptions that the particles are spherical.
Ultrasonic sonication bath (AS ONE Corporation, AS12GTU) with an oscillation
frequency at 35 kHz, 60 W was used in the particulation control study.

Monomer Synthesis
The schematic representation of the
synthesis of the biobased aromatic DKP diamine from 4APhe is shown
in Scheme 1.(a) Synthesis of 4APhe-z: a solution of
4APhe (10.0 g, 0.040 mol) dissolved in 10% AcOH (340 mL) was added
drop by drop with 5 M NaOH to raise pH to 3. A solution of CbzCl (6
mL, 0.040 mol) in 1,4-dioxane (340 mL) was then slowly added, and
the mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The mixture
was brought to pH 7 by 5 M NaOH before filtration and washed with
water. The expected product was obtained as white shiny powder with
82% yield. The specification was as follows. 1H NMR (400
MHz, DMSO-d6, δ, ppm): 2.76 (dd,
1H, J = 8.8, 14.0 Hz), 3.08 (dd, 1H, J = 3.4, 14.0 Hz), 3.60 (t, 1H, J = 3.4 Hz), 5.15

followed by the addition of Boc2O (3.5 g, 0.016 mol). The
reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. THF was
then removed by evaporation, and 1 M HCl was added to bring pH to

to a 0 °C solution of Boc-4APhe-z (8.5 g, 0.021 mol) in dichloromethane
(DCM) (120 mL), HOBt (3.05 g, 0.022 mol) was added followed by the
addition of DCC (5.08 g, 0.025 mol). The reaction mixture was stirred
for 1 h and allowed it to cool to room temperature. Then, a solution
of methyl-4APhe-z (8.25 g, 0.023 mol) in DMF (23 mL) was added and
followed by the addition of trimethylamine (3.4 mL, 0.024 mol). The
reaction was stirred further at room temperature overnight. To work
up, the precipitated dicyclohexylurea was filtered off and washed
with little DCM. The filtrate was concentrated by evaporation and
its pH was adjusted to 2−3 by adding 1H NCl under

was charged with 98% formic acid (466 mL), followed by stirring for
5 h at room temperature. Excess formic acid was then removed in vacuum
(temperature less than 30 °C was maintained). The obtained crude
was refluxed in the mixture of 310 mL of 2-butanol and 155 mL of toluene
at 110 °C for 5 h, followed by the filtration and drying under
vacuum to obtain the expected product with 58% yield. The specification

PAA and PI Syntheses
A typical procedure for the synthesis
of PAA is shown in Scheme 2. A diamine of DKP-4APhe (0.20 g, 0.62 mmol) mixed with an
equimolar of dianhydrides such as CBDA (0.12 g, 0.62 mmol), BTDA (0.20
g, 0.62 mmol), PMDA (0.14 g, 0.62 mmol), DSDA (0.22 g, 0.62 mmol),
OPDA (0.19 g, 0.62 mmol), BPDA (0.18 g, 0.62 mmol), and DHCDA (0.16
g, 0.62 mmol) was dissolved in DMAc (1 mL, 0.6 M) under a nitrogen
atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for
48 h to yield a viscous PAA solution. The PAA solution was added into
a 1:1 mixture of water and methanol and precipitated to obtain the
respective PAA polymers in quantitative yields (PAA–BTDA: yield
93%, PAA–CBDA: yield 91%, PAA–PMDA: yield 90%, PAA–DSDA:
yield 93%, PAA–OPDA: yield 90%, PAA–BPDA: yield 92%
and PAA–DHCDA: yield 89%). PI was obtained by thermal imidization
of the PAA in an oven under vacuum by stepwise heating at 100, 150,
and 200 °C for 1 h and 250 °C for 3 h at each step.

Preparation of PAA and PI Particles
In a typical solvent
displacement method, a PAA solution in DMAc (4% w/v, 100 μL)
was dropped into an aqueous solution of Triton X-100 (1% w/v, 10 mL)
and magnetically stirred vigorously as a poor solvent at room temperature
to obtain PAA particles. Collecting PAA by centrifugation, the two-step
imidization was subsequently performed to convert PAA to PI. First,
PAA was chemically imidized using a mixture of pyridine and acetic
anhydride (1:1 M ratio, 100 μL). After 3 h, the chemicals were
removed by centrifugation, and thermal imidization was performed at
250 °C for 3 h, resulting in yellowish powder of PI particles.

To study the particulation control of PIs, PAA particles collected
by centrifugation were redispersed in different solvent systems such
as acetone/water mixture, methanol/water mixture, and cyclohexane
and further sonicated for 5 h. After that, subsequent imidization
to convert PAA to PI was carried out by the chemical procedure and
thermal treatment. The morphology of redispersed particles of PAA
and PI was determined using SEM, as illustrated in Figure 6. Here, PI–BTDA was
chosen as an example for study.

Figure 6 Schematic illustration of particle formation
and deformation of
PAA and PI by the solvent-assisted approach.

Particle Morphology Control
Various factors during
particle formation could govern the properties of fabricated particles
(e.g., particle size). The effect of formulation variables (polymer
concentration: 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6% (w/v); surfactant concentration:
0.1, 0.5, 1, and 3% (w/v); polymer structure with various dianhydrides:
BTDA, CBDA, DSDA, and PMDA) on the particle size was studied.
