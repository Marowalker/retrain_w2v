We report the synthesis and structural diversity of Zn(II) metal-organic framework (MOF)
with in situ formation of tetrazole ligand 3-ptz [3-ptz = 5-(3-pyridyl)tetrazolate] as a function pH. By varying
the initial reaction pH, we obtain high-quality crystals of the noncentrosymmetric
three-dimensional MOF Zn(3-ptz)2, mixed phases
involving the zinc-aqua complex [Zn(H2O)4(3-ptz)2]·4H2O, and two-dimensional MOF crystals Zn(OH)(3-ptz)
with a tunable microrod morphology, keeping reaction time, temperature,
and metal–ligand molar ratio constant. Structures are characterized
by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy, and UV–vis spectroscopy. We discuss
the observed structural diversity in terms of the relative abundance
of hydroxo-zinc species in solution for different values of pH.

Introduction
Metal-organic
frameworks (MOFs), a novel class of functional crystalline
materials,1 have found a wide range of
applications due to their favorable properties for gas storage and
separation,2 sensing,3 energy storage,4 light harvesting,5 drug delivery,6 and
nonlinear optics.7 Depending on the choice
of organic ligands, metal nodes, and synthesis conditions, self-assembled
MOF structures can have a rich variety of topologies and dimensionalities.8 Predicting the equilibrium MOF structures obtained
by solvothermal synthesis9 is in general
challenging due to the multiple parameters that determine the self-assembly
process, such as metal–ligand molar ratio,10 reaction time and temperature,11 solvent polarity,12 and reaction pH.13 However, it is possible to activate or deactivate
specific coordination modes of multidentate ligands by controlling
the reaction pH, which is a robust and cost-effective way to manipulate
the MOF self-assembly process.

Tetrazole-based ligands have
attracted much attention in coordination
chemistry due to their large number of coordination modes involving
up to four nitrogen atoms,14 which can
result in a large combination of possible MOF structures with different
topologies and dimensionality. Tetrazole derivatives have also excellent
linear and nonlinear optical properties. For example, push–pull
tetrazole complexes with both electron-donor and electron-acceptor
substituents have shown very efficient second-order nonlinear optical
activity in powder samples,15 ferroelectric
behavior,16 and strong photoluminescence.17

Under hydrothermal conditions, pyridyl-tetrazoles
ligands exhibit
six coordination modes and the pyridyl moiety can further coordinate
to additional metal ions, giving rise to a potentially large number
of MOF structures.15c,15d,18 Despite the multiple coordination modes available for pyridyl-tetrazole
ligands, only nine MOF structures with zinc salts have been reported
via in situ ligand synthesis.15c,15d,19 One possible route to direct the self-assembly of MOF structures
is by controlling the reaction pH, which in turn controls the relative
abundance of distinct metal-ion species in solution. The relative
abundance of hydroxo-zinc species at different pHs can promote certain
MOF structures over others, by changing the available coordination
modes of the metal ion, for fixed metal–ligand molar ratio
and hydrothermal conditions.

In this work, we use the initial
reaction pH as a control variable
to drive the synthesis of different types of zinc-based metal-organic
frameworks and mononuclear complexes with in situ formation of pyridyl-tetrazole
ligands, as well as zinc oxide. We discuss the crystal structure and
morphology of the obtained materials and interpret the observed structural
diversity in terms of the relative abundance of different zinc species
in solution as a function of pH.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows representative
optical microscope images of the crystals obtained at different initial
pH values. For a range of low pH values, we obtain well-defined octahedron
crystals with high purity, corresponding to the three-dimensional
metal-organic framework (3D MOF) bis[5-(3-pyridyl)tetrazolato]zinc(II) [Zn(3-ptz)2], as confirmed
below by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The same Zn(3-ptz)2 MOF forms also in the neutral pH range
(pH 6.0–7.0), in addition to other zinc-tetrazole coordination
structures that we describe below. For initial pH values exceeding
7.0, we obtain large quantities of thin, ultralong microrod structures
that we identify below as a two-dimensional MOF (2D MOF). We obtain 2D MOF crystals with visibly larger microrod
lengths at higher pH values in the range 10–12. Strongly basic
environments (pH > 12) do not lead to MOF formation. Instead, we
obtain
large quantities of ZnO nanostructures.21

Figure 1 Microscope images of the materials obtained at different initial
pH values, together with the relative abundance of hydroxy-zinc majority
species in aqueous solution at 25 °C.20 Acidic environments result in either pure tetrahedral crystals Zn(3-ptz)2 (3D MOF) or a mixed phase
with zinc-tetra-aqua complex Zn(H2O)4(3-ptz)2·4H2O (ZAC). Basic environments
result in elongated crystals of Zn(OH)(3-ptz) (2D MOF) and zinc oxide (ZnO) for the highest pH values.

Figure 2a,b shows
the measured powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and the Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, respectively, of the materials
obtained within the range of pH shown in Figure 1. For pH values in the lower range (pH <
5.0), the diffraction peaks are in excellent agreement with the simulated
XRD pattern reported for the tetragonal Zn(3-ptz)2 structure.15c For
pH values slightly below 7.0, we obtained mixed phases of the 3D MOFZn(3-ptz)2 and
the triclinic crystal Zn(H2O)4(3-ptz)2·4H2O (ZAC).22

to the simulated pattern for Zn(3-ptz)2 (3D MOF), Zn(H2O)4(3-ptz)2·4H2O (ZAC), Zn(OH)(3-ptz) (2D
MOF), and zinc oxide (ZnO). (b) Fourier transform
infrared spectra for the same samples in (a).

In general, for the formation of zinc-based MOFs with in
situ formation
of 3-ptz ligands, the pH of the reaction must allow zinc
species in solution to act as Lewis acid catalyzers of the reaction
that forms 3-ptz from sodium azide and 3-cyanopyridine.19c,23 The catalyzing character of the solvated metal complexes that form
in our system is only inhibited under highly basic conditions. From
the relative abundance of dissolved zinc hydroxide species in water,20 we expect the concentration of Zn(OH)42– to grow at higher pH values, decreasing the
ability of zinc(II) to catalyze the ligand formation reaction. For
the range of pH values in which the zinc species Zn2+(aq), Zn(OH)+(aq), Zn(OH)2(aq), and Zn(OH)3–(aq) become
more abundant,20 we expect the 3-ptz ligand to form in situ, due to the Lewis acid character of these
zinc and zinc-hydroxo species.

The formation of a highly pure
phase of Zn(3-ptz)2 crystals
under acidic conditions (Figure 2a, pH 4.1) is consistent with
the dominant availability of the octahedral solvated Zn2+ ions (strong Lewis acid) at the mixing temperature,20 which favors both in situ ligand formation and the tetrahedral
symmetry of the 3D MOF assembly process.15c Steric effects associated with the size of
the 3-ptz ligands lower the symmetry of the coordination
sphere from octahedral to tetrahedral as water is displaced upon MOF
assembly.

Increasing the pH closer to the neutral range (Figure 2a, pH 6.4) increases
the fraction
of Zn(OH)+ species in solution relative to Zn2+, 20 promoting the formation
of ZAC in a mixed phase with Zn(3-ptz)2 under hydrothermal conditions. This mixed phase
can be purified by filtering the Zn(3-ptz)2 crystals at 105 °C after completion of the reaction
time. Further increasing the pH beyond the neutral range (Figure 2a, pH 7.6, 10.3)
results in a highly pure crystal phase with XDR patterns that match
the reported MOF catena-((μ3-5-(3-pyridyl)tetrazol-N,N′,N″)-(μ2-hydroxo)-zinc) [Zn(OH)(3-ptz)],15d in which hydroxyl ligands along the c crystal axis bridge adjacent 2D zinc-tetrazole coordination
networks on the a–b plane.
Preferential growth along the c direction results
in the quasi-one-dimensional (1D) rodlike morphology shown in Figure 1.

The formation
of ZAC and 2D MOF structures
in nonacidic environments can be partly understood in terms of the
greater relative abundance of the solvated Zn(OH)+(aq) and Zn(OH)2(aq) species at the mixing temperature.20 The strong Zn–OH coordination bond results
in a solvated coordination sphere with lower symmetry than the octahedral
coordination sphere of the hexa-aquo Zn2+ ion, which is
the dominant species at lower pH. The 3-ptz ligands thus
prefer to coordinate with the zinc ion in directions orthogonal to
the Zn–OH bond, minimizing steric effects, a bonding pattern
exhibited in both ZAC(22) and 2D MOF(15d) crystals.

Figure 2b shows
that there are pH-dependent infrared absorption features in the region
2500–4000 cm–1. For lower pH values, a weak
C–H stretch band at 3048 cm–1 of the pyridine
ring in Zn(3-ptz)2 is clearly
visible. However, in the pH range 6.0–7.0, where the zinc-tetra-aqua
complex ZAC forms, the much broader and intense O–H
stretch band associated with hydrogen bonding dominates that spectral
region. In the pH range 7.0–12.0, the broad O–H band
disappears in favor of a much sharper O–H stretch peak (3572
cm–1) associated with free hydroxyl ligands in Zn(OH)(3-ptz). In summary, the FTIR spectra confirm the reported
bands for pyridyl-tetrazole15c,15d below pH 12.0. For
pH above 12.0, we obtain the characteristic spectra of ZnO.21,24

Figure 3a shows
a representative scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of Zn(3-ptz)2 MOF crystals obtained with
high purity in the lower pH range, exhibiting well-defined octahedrons
with size varying in the range of 100–200 μm. The magnified
image in Figure 3b
of the same sample shows the growth of smaller nanostructures on the
surface of the largest MOF crystallites.

Figure 3 SEM images of sample
obtained at pH 4.1 for two different magnifications.

Figure 4 shows representative
SEM images of the material obtained in the neutral pH range, featuring
smaller and less-defined crystallites than those obtained at lower
pH. We discussed above that this pH range gives mixed phases of Zn(3-ptz)2 and the tetra-aqua complex ZAC. Figure 4a–d shows that the presence of tetra-aqua complex affects
the superficial growth and hence the morphology of the Zn(3-ptz)2 MOF crystals. We find that by filtering
the reaction products at 105 °C, immediately after completion
of the reaction, it is possible to separate the desired 3D MOFZn(3-ptz)2 from the tetra-aqua
byproduct efficiently, as shown in Figure 4e,f. From the reaction yield upon filtering,
we estimate that at least twice as much of zinc ions are involved
in the formation of the 3D MOF crystal in comparison
to the tetra-aqua complex at 105 °C. Following the reported synthetic
procedure without hot filtration,15c an
equilibrium is established between the zinc-tetra-aqua complex and Zn(3-ptz)2 MOF upon cooling to room
temperature, giving the mixed-phase XRD pattern in Figure 4d.

Figure 5 shows representative
SEM images of the materials obtained in basic initial environments.
This pH range gives a pure phase of 2D MOFZn(OH)(3-ptz). For the most moderate alkaline initial conditions (pH 7.6), Figure 5a,c shows the growth
of relatively long microrods with lengths varying in the range of
300–400 μm, and widths in the range of 1.5–2.0
μm. Magnified images exhibit the growth of large quantities
of comparatively smaller crystals with sizes on the order of 2 μm
or less on the surface of the long microrod structures. Figure 5b,d shows that for pH 10.3
the nucleation rate is much higher, as we observe large amounts of
smaller microrod 2D MOF structures with a broad length
distribution in the range of 1–10 μm. The observed microrod
morphology of MOF Zn(OH)(3-ptz) is consistent with the
Bravais–Friedel–Donnay–Harker (BFDH) morphology
predictions shown in Figure 6. Despite the 2D coordination topology, the 1D (rodlike) morphology
of the crystal results from the preferred growth in the direction
orthogonal to the coordination planes. Microrods can form by preferential
growth in the c direction, likely due to the self-assembly
process between zinc hydroxide species coordinating to (3-ptz) ligands and hydroxyl ions, generating the Zn–OH–Zn–OH–Zn
chains in this direction, as reported by single-crystal diffraction.15d

Figure 7 shows
the
room-temperature solid-state UV–vis absorption spectra of 3D MOFZn(3-ptz)2 representative
of the samples obtained in the lower pH range. The 3D MOF crystal does not absorb in the visible region because zinc ions
in the framework have a closed shell (d10). Density functional
theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the absorption spectrum of
the mononuclear complex Zn(3-ptz)2 is dominated by π–π* transitions in the tetrazole
ligand 3-ptz. For comparison, Figure 7 also shows the absorption spectrum of protonated
pyridyl-tetrazole ligand 3-Hptz in aqueous solution.
In the 3D MOF crystal, the lowest-energy π-transition
is red-shifted by 9 nm (1194 cm–1) relative to the
protonated ligand spectrum and also becomes more intense. This behavior
may indicate a possible electrostatic interaction between the ligand
transition dipole moments in the solid phase.25

featuring two strong absorption peaks at 234 and 273 nm. For comparison,
the absorption spectrum of the hydrated tetrazole ligand (3-Hptz) in aqueous solution is also shown (blue curve). Zn(3-ptz)2 and (3-Hptz) spectra are normalized by
their absorbance at 278 and 240 nm, respectively.

Conclusions and Outlook
We explore the structural diversity
of zinc-tetrazole metal-organic
frameworks (MOFs) with in situ ligand formation by modifying the initial
pH of the reaction mixture. Optimal yield and high purity of the noncentrosymmetric 3D MOF structure Zn(3-ptz)2(15c) was obtained under acidic conditions
(pH ≈ 4). Alkaline environments strongly favor the assembly
of the 2D MOF structure Zn(OH)(3-ptz),15d whose rodlike crystal morphology can be manipulated
by changing the initial reaction pH within the range 7.5–11.0.
The synthesis carried out without initial pH manipulation (pH = 6.4)
gives a mixed phase of the 3D MOFZn(3-ptz)2 and the zinc-tetra-aqua complex [Zn(3-ptz)2(H2O)4]·4H2O,22 which
can be efficiently separated by high-temperature filtration. Although
the solvothermal syntheses of Zn(3-ptz)2 and Zn(OH)(3-ptz) metal-organic frameworks has
been previously reported by varying the reaction time and temperature,15c,15d we show for the first time that it is possible to obtain these MOFs
in high purity by simply varying the mixing pH of the reactants.

We understand the role of pH throughout our experiments as a modulator
of the ligand formation reaction and MOF assembly process. The observed
pH-dependent structural diversity is related to the relative abundance
of solvated zinc-hydroxo complexes of the form [Zn(OH)n]2–n in aqueous
solution,20 being the solvated Zn2+ ion the Lewis acid with the best reported catalytic behavior for
the in situ tetrazole ligand formation.26 We relate the appearance of [Zn(3-ptz)2(H2O)4]·4H2O and Zn(OH)(3-ptz) in nonacidic environments
to the presence of strong Zn–OH bonds in the solvated zinc-hydroxo
coordination sphere, which force the 3-ptz ligands to
coordinate zinc ions orthogonal to the Zn–OH direction. We
can expect that the relative abundance of metal-hydroxo complexes
in solution could also be used as a strategy to explore the structural
diversity of other metal-organic frameworks with metal-catalyzed in
situ formation of tetrazole ligands.27 Cadmium-based
structures are promising candidates to explore, given their proven
potential to catalyze the Demko–Sharpless ligand formation
reaction.28

In summary, our results
show that manipulating the initial reaction
pH can be an economical route to engineer the assembly of noncentrosymmetric
zinc-tetrazole MOF structures, which may become advantageous for future
development of MOF-based nonlinear crystals for applications in optical
communication.7

Methods
The in
situ synthesis of tetrazole ligands was done according to
the Demko–Sharpless method.26 All
of the reactants and chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and
utilized without any further purification. A mixture of 3-cyanopyridine
(4 mmol), NaN3 (6 mmol), and ZnCl2 (2 mmol)
was dissolved in 6 mL of distilled water. This mixture was transferred
into a glass bottle and then put in a box furnace at a high temperature
of 105 °C for 24 h. The pH value was adjusted by using HNO3 (66%) or KOH (18.8 M) solutions immediately after mixing
the reactants (initial pH) and measured with a pH meter (pH 2700 Oakton).
The as-synthesized materials were taken out of the furnace after 24
h, filtered, and dried at room temperature prior to the structural
analysis. Powder X-ray diffraction analysis was done using a X Shimadzu
XRD 6000 diffractometer with Cu Kα (l = 1.5418 Å) radiation
for structural characterization and phase determination. Microstructural
characterizations of the synthesized materials were done by an optical
microscope and a scanning electron microscope (Zeiss EVO MA10). UV–vis
solid spectra were obtained at room temperature using a PerkinElmer
Lambda 1050 Wideband UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer. IR
spectra (4000–400 cm–1) of the compounds
were obtained using a Jasco FTIR-4600 spectrophotometer equipped with
an ATR PRO ONE.

Bravais–Friedel–Donnay–Harker
(BFDH) theoretical
crystal morphology analyses were done with commercial software (Mercury),
from the cif file in ref (15d). DFT calculations of the mononuclear [Zn(3-ptz)4]2+ complex were carried out with commercial software
(Gaussian) using hybrid functional of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof
(PBE0) to represent the electron density. A triple-ζ basis set
for H, C, N, and O atoms, including a polarization function for nonhydrogen
atoms, was employed. In all calculations, 15 singlet excitations were
considered.
