Microwave dielectric loss tangent
measurements are demonstrated
as a method for quantifying trace sp2-hybridized carbon
impurities in sub-micron diamond powders. Appropriate test samples
are prepared by vacuum annealing at temperatures from 600 to 1200
°C to vary the sp2/sp3 carbon ratio through
partial surface graphitization. Microwave permittivity measurements
are compared with those obtained using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), Raman spectroscopy, and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS).
The average particle size remains constant (verified by scanning electron
microscopy) to decouple any geometric dielectric effects from the
microwave measurements. After annealing, a small increase in sp2 carbon was identified from the XPS C 1s and Auger spectra,
the EELS σ* peak in the C 1s spectra, and the D and G bands
in Raman spectroscopy, although a quantifiable diamond to G-band peak
ratio was unobtainable. Surface hydrogenation was also evidenced in
the Raman and XPS O 1s data. Microwave cavity perturbation measurements
show that the dielectric loss tangent increases with increasing sp2 bonding, with the most pertinent finding being that these
values correlate with other measurements and that trace concentrations
of sp2 carbon as small as 5% can be detected.

1 Introduction
Sub-micron diamonds allow
the outstanding material characteristics
of diamond relating to its electrical, thermal, chemical, and mechanical
properties to be applied on microscopic scales. Some pertinent examples
of this include transistors with excellent heat spreading,1−3 chemically inert particles for drug delivery,4−7 and mechanically stable micro-electro-mechanical
system structures for nanoscale sensing applications.8,9 However, as
diamond gets smaller, the surface area increases, and so does the
volume of any non-diamond surface content, hydrogen terminations,
and disordered,
sp2, and non-diamond carbons in the well-known core–shell
model.10−12 Non-diamond functional group terminations are preferred
for conjugating certain types of proteins,13 however, reconstructed sp2 carbon terminations are considered
a hindrance as this causes particle agglomeration;11,12,14 hence, there has been much research into
rigorous purification methods.15−17 Hence, characterization of non-diamond
impurities on nano-diamond is a prominent research area for assessing
its quality in various applications.

One of the most popular
methods to examine diamond particles is
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)because of its sensitivity to
particle surfaces, its low sample volume requirement, and its ability
to identify and infer carbon- and hydrogen-related terminations.18 Carbon-based impurities can be identified in
a number of ways, one of which is to observe the C 1s spectrum. For
sp3 carbon, the C 1s peak is observed at a higher binding
energy than sp2 carbon,19−21 so one can obtain the
sp2/sp3 carbon ratio either through observing
shifts or by deconvolution of the two associated peaks. Although,
the C 1s peak is generally used as a charge reference at 284.8 eV,
associated with the thin layer of carbon that is formed when the sample
is exposed to air (called the adventitious carbon peak), making any
absolute shifts is difficult to determine. Furthermore, surface charging
may shift the observed peak.20 More effective
methods use different regions of the XPS spectra, including the valence
band region and the derivative of the C KLL Auger spectra.10,22−24 Speranza and Laidani22 showed that the latter case minimizes the referencing error in determining
the sp2/sp3 carbon ratio because it is a differential
technique using the eV difference in maxima and minima.

Another
notable spectroscopic method is scanning transmission electron
microscopy using electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM–EELS).
In a similar fashion to XPS, EELS is capable of probing both surface
plasmons and inner core (C 1s) electrons. Bulk diamond exhibits a
strong σ-plasmon peak at around 33 eV, with an additional surface
plasmon at 22 eV. The π-plasmon peak in graphite is at a much
lower energy loss of around 5–8 eV.10,23 However, the latter feature is challenging to measure as it is close
to the zero loss peak and depends upon the experimental setup. Easier
to obtain experimentally is the carbon K-edge loss spectra, resulting
from the excitation of C 1s electrons to vacant π* and σ*
orbitals. The former lower energy state is related to sp2 (reported between 285 and 290 eV), and the latter higher state is
related to sp3 (reported at greater than 289 eV).10,25−27

Other spectroscopic methods to measure amorphous
impurities in
nano-diamonds are challenging as the strong characteristic signatures
from sp3 carbon in high volume fractions effectively flood
the spectrum. Prime examples of this include nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) and Raman spectroscopy, where, respectively, the 36.3 ppm sp3 peak dominates over the 130–160 ppm range for sp2 carbon and the 1332 cm–1 diamond peak dominates
the spectra over the broad D and G bands at around 1340 and 1580 cm–1.23,28,29 However, numerous methods have been used to desensitize the presence
of sp3 carbon; changing the excitation wavelengths further
toward the infrared (IR) region in Raman spectroscopy reveals many
other features,30−32 and in other cases, increasing the sample exposure
time increases the signal to noise ratio. For the inspection of trace
amounts of sp2 carbon impurities, the material probe needs
to be insensitive to the crystalline structure of
diamond.

Dielectric or impedance spectroscopy, which measures
electrical
conductivity and/or dielectric loss, is ideal in this case because
the highly insulating nature of pure diamond implies that the dominant
electrical contribution will be due to conducting impurities. Because
there is such a large contrast in the electrical properties of sp3 and sp2 carbon, it is clear that their concentrations
can be indirectly inferred. There is, however, a drawback to using
impedance spectroscopy on powders (particularly in the dc to kHz frequency
range), where electrodes that are in physical contact with the powdered
samples are required.33−35 Although impedance spectroscopy gives a wideband
electrical response of the material, an additional fabrication stage
is typically needed, such as incorporating the powder into a solid
host material or producing films with electrodes fabricated in direct
contact. However, one can extend the measurement toward MHz and GHz
frequencies to perform microwave dielectric spectroscopy, whereby
noncontact resonating structures can be used to infer the conductivity
and dielectric properties of a material36 even in the presence of varying temperatures and gas atmospheres.37,38 In particular, microwave cavity perturbation (MCP) has been highlighted
as a potential technique for the examination of nano-diamond impurities
owing to its high precision and fast sample analysis (in minutes,
including sample preparation), although, its lower limits for evaluating
trace quantities of sp2 are yet to be tested.29,39,40

MCP, unlike XPS, EELS,
or Raman spectroscopy, is not a phase quantification
technique and does not provide a fingerprint of the materials present.
It is a technique that measures the complex permittivity and permeability
of a material at microwave frequencies, typically using a hollow metal
structure (the “cavity”) with well-defined resonances
over the bandwidth from 1 to 10 GHz. This is achieved by perturbing
the electromagnetic fields of the resonant cavity mode with a volume
of the sample and measuring the change in the resonant frequency and
quality factor (Q = resonant frequency/–3
dB bandwidth). The dielectric and magnetic properties of the sample
can be obtained through the first-order cavity perturbation equation
for a porous powder sample41 1   2  where
εeff,1 and εeff,2 are the effective
measured dielectric constant and loss,
respectively, Vs and Veff are the sample volume and the effective cavity mode
volume, respectively, ΔBW = BW0 − BWs and Δf = f0 − fs are the changes in the measured bandwidth
and frequency, and f0 is the unperturbed
resonance frequency. Cavity Q factors of greater
than 8000 can be achieved at room temperature with orders of magnitude
higher in the super-conducting regime, making the system extremely
sensitive to electromagnetic field perturbations at resonance. For
the current system, practical measurable differences in the perturbed
and unperturbed frequencies and bandwidth of the cylindrical TM010 mode at 2.5 GHz (⌀cavity = 92 mm, ⌀sample = 2 mm) can be as low as 1 kHz. With a volume scaling
ratio of Veff/Vs = 0.2898 × (46 mm/1 mm)2 = 613.2, the random errors
associated with the dielectric measurement is approximately 2.5 ×
10–4.40 The dominant
contribution to the standard deviation of the measurement is, however,
the systematic errors associated with the sample volume and packing
density, typically around 5% in previous studies.40 Materials with a large permittivity produce proportionally
large perturbations on the cavity resonances. Previous studies of
nano-diamonds with varying impurities have shown large differences
in the imaginary part of the complex permittivity in the 2–10
GHz range.29,40 The surface impurity concentration
was controlled through the surface area by varying the particle sizes
(from 10 to 1000 nm); hence, the volume of surface impurities is the
largest in powders with smaller average particle sizes. The dielectric
loss component was observed to being proportional to the sp2 and disorder carbon concentrations, verified with other techniques.
This work did not consider the size and geometric variation of the
pure diamond cores and how it affects the observed permittivity. Considering
diamond alone, a size-dependent dielectric permittivity may be observed
as a consequence of the polarization-related effects from the dangling
bonds of the diamond terminations.42

We would expect systematic variations in the effective (i.e., measured)
permittivity of a powder owing to geometrical factors. Assuming a
narrow particle size distribution per sample, there will be large
enhancements of local electric fields in the gaps between smaller
particles, which give rise to enhanced polarization (owing to the
increased external field). This is manifested as an increased effective
permittivity of a powder sample consisting of small particles over
one of the same volume but comprised of larger particles. The second
is the particle shape, which is hard to quantify, but again results
in much enhanced local electric fields in regions outside the particles
where the surface has a small radius of curvature. The overall trend
is for the effective permittivity to increase as the particle size
is reduced while maintaining the total volume.

In this research,
we mitigate any size- or shape-related effects
by using diamond powders of the same average particle size and shape,
here approximately 710 nm. A simpler method has been proposed to control
the sp2 concentration through vacuum annealing of diamond
powders of the same particle size at temperatures from 600 to 1200
°C for a fixed time. The reason why such a large particle size
is chosen is due to the fact that there is a much larger volume fraction
of sp3 carbon compared to any other surface impurities
(i.e., it being more representative of a purer diamond powder). In
this way, trace volumes of surface impurities can be introduced to
test the limits of our MCP system. At temperatures greater than 800
°C, partial surface graphitization is expected as is commonly
found in the literature, however, most studies tend to use much smaller
particle sizes with a much larger initial volume fraction of sp2 carbon.19,23,28 The proposed sample method minimizes the geometric dependence explained
previously in the MCP measurements, and the resultant differences
in the starting and annealed powders will clearly be due to the changes
in the material properties. Because there is a firm understanding
from the literature about using XPS, STEM–EELS, and Raman spectroscopy
to identify the sp2/sp3 carbon ratio in carbon-rich
materials, they are used as comparison standards for the proposed
MCP method to see if the dielectric losses do, in fact, correlate
with the sp2 concentration and not just size as well as
to identify the trace sensitivity detection limits.

2 Experimental Methods
Commercially available sub-micron diamond
powder was used throughout
(Van Moppes Syndia SYP 0.5-1). The median quoted size of these particles
is 710 nm. This powder was annealed in a vacuum chamber at 600, 800,
1000, and 1200 °C for 1 h with the aim to partially graphitize
the surfaces of the particles. The powder samples were spread out
in a graphite crucible and sat atop a ceramic-topped sample heater,
with the chamber evacuated to a pressure of ≤10–5 mbar before annealing, and the samples were left to cool down under
vacuum before removing. Field emission scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) was carried out after annealing to ensure that the particle
size remained constant. The particles were first sputtered with a
thin film of gold/platinum alloy (60%:40%) and then measured using
a Carl Zeiss 1540xB dual focused ion beam SEM system at 5 kV at 10–6 mbar. MCP measurements were conducted using the system
detailed in previous nano-diamond studies.29,39,40 Briefly, the cavity is an aluminum cylindrical
cavity resonator (inner ⌀cavity = 92 mm, hcavity = 40 mm) which has six accessible resonant modes that
can be used for complex permittivity measurements at discrete frequencies
from 2.5 to 9.4 GHz. The resonant frequency and quality factor (from
−3 dB bandwidth) were measured using a Keysight performance
network analyser (N5232A). Complex permittivity was obtained using
the first-order cavity perturbation equations, which relate the changes
in the resonant frequency and quality factor to the dielectric constant
and losses, respectively. A schematic of the MCP setup is given in Figure 1. XPS measurements
were conducted using a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD system with a monochromatic
Al Kα X-ray source operating at 144 W. Initial wide scans were
performed with pass energies of 1 eV, and high resolution scans were
performed with 0.5 eV. Postprocessing (low pass filtering, spline
interpolation, and differentiation) of the Auger spectra was carried
out using a program written in National Instruments LabVIEW. Raman
spectroscopy was conducted using a Renishaw inVia Reflex with a near-IR
laser (λ = 785 nm, ×50 objective and power of 10%). The
STEM–EELS measurements were taken using a FEI Tecnai F30 microscope.
The diamond particles were dispersed by an ultrasonic bath into acetone
solution, deposited over a lacey carbon film grid, and confirmed using
bright-field transmission electron microscopy. Annular dark field
STEM micrographs with corresponding EELS spectra were taken for each
sample at a number of positions on the particles, with the results
presented here serving as a representative measurement.

Figure 1 Schematic of
the MCP system used in this experiment. Diamond powders
were filled into VitroCom quartz tubes (⌀sample outer tube = 2.4 mm, ⌀sample = 2 mm) and placed into the
center of the resonator. The resonant frequency and quality factor
(from −3 dB bandwidth) were measured using a vector network
analyzer. COMSOL Multiphysics simulations of the electric field distributions
of the TM modes used in this study are shown in the top right.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 XPS
The XPS measurements of C 1s
and O 1s and the differential of the Auger spectra are shown in Figure 2. The C 1s peak is
normally dominated by the contribution from the C–C bonds and
is conventionally used as a charge reference at 284.8 eV, as explained
earlier. This makes identification of the carbon phases across the
different samples challenging. The analysis given here for the C 1s
peak assumes that any charge offsets are constant and systematic errors
are the same across the measurements (all resultant spectra presented
are shifted by 3.08 eV to allow the O 1s peaks to fall around the
expected values of 532 eV), again highlighting the referencing limitation
of measuring the sp2/sp3 carbon ratio using
this method. For the starting material, the C 1s spectrum exhibits
a convolution of two C peaks, indicative of both sp3 and
surface sp2 carbon phases.23 The higher peak situated at around 285 eV is associated with sp3 carbon, whereas the lower and broader features at around
284 eV are associated with sp2 carbon. As the diamonds
are annealed, the main sp3 peak becomes less dominant while
the lower binding energy peak grows, implicit of an increasing sp2 concentration on the surface of the particles.19,23 At 1200 °C, however, the C 1s spectrum is similar to that of
the starting material, indicating minimal change in the sp2 carbon concentration. This is an intriguing result because it has
otherwise been reported that increasing annealing temperature tends
to increase graphitization.23,28

Figure 2 XPS C 1s (top-left),
O 1s (top-right), and Auger differential (middle)
spectra and change in the D-value, C 1s peak position,
and O 1s/C 1s ratio as a function of the annealing temperature (bottom).
For the C 1s peak, two main peaks are noticed and are attributed to
surface sp3 and sp2 carbon. The shift of the
largest peak toward lower binding energies with annealing temperature
is indicative of an increasing sp2 concentration. The change
in the D-value (difference in the maximum and minimum
of the Auger differential) can be related to the sp2/sp3 carbon ratio. The change in the O 1s/C 1s ratio loosely infers
hydrogenation through the substitution of oxygen for hydrogen.

A more robust way of obtaining
the sp2/sp3 carbon ratio from XPS spectra is
to examine the Auger spectrum and
obtain the “D-value” or “D-parameter”,22,43 obtained from the first
differential of the C KLL Auger spectrum; the D-parameter
is taken as the energy difference between the maximum and minimum
points. This approach is more appropriate than observing the C 1s
shifts because the Auger spectrum does not require any referencing
as it is a differential measurement.20,24 The differentials
of the Auger spectra with the associated D-values
for each sample are plotted in Figure 2, where similar trends to the C 1s spectra are noticed,
with the highest D-value observed at 1000 °C.
The anticipated rise in the sp2 concentration with the
annealing temperature is again apparent, whereas the anomalous decrease
at 1200 °C remains. In addition to the changing sp2 concentration, the peak O 1s intensity varies in a similar fashion,
with the O 1s/C 1s peak ratio loosely indicative of hydrogenation
as oxygen is substituted for hydrogen.44

3.2 Raman Spectroscopy
The Raman spectroscopy
measurements are shown in Figure 3. The strong peak at approximately 1332 cm–1 is characteristic of the F2g vibrational mode in sp3 carbon, hence indicating a large volume fraction of diamond
most commonly witnessed for microcrystalline diamond.31,45 This peak may be obscured by additional D and G bands, associated
with the aromatic A1g breathing mode of disordered sp2 carbon and the E2g bond stretching of sp2 carbon pairs, respectively, characteristic of graphitic carbon,46 although in this instance, these bands are of
minute intensity as compared to the diamond peak, as shown in Figure 3. Through linear
extrapolation of a background baseline at higher wavenumbers, the
inset in Figure 3 reveals
a broad dispersion of bands around the diamond peak from 1320 to 1600
cm–1, where the D and G bands would be present.
This band is most noticeable at the annealing temperature of 1000
°C and diminishes with decreasing temperature,
whereas the band of the 1200 °C sample is again less than that
at 1000 °C. This is most likely through the formation of small
volumes of surface-disordered sp2 carbon, albeit too small
and sporadically distributed to produce a discernible D or G band.
Additionally, the background levels vary among the samples, generally
attributed to the photoluminescence (PL) of heavily hydrogenated samples.46 The varying PL background correlates with the
XPS O 1s findings in that as well as any increase in sp2 carbon, hydrogenation is also taking place to some extent
during the annealing process.

Figure 3 Raman spectra (top) of annealed sub-micron diamond
powders using
a near-IR laser. All spectra are normalized to the peak value. For
analyzing the D and G bands, a baseline background (dotted) is taken
through a linear fit in the higher wavenumber region. A clear diamond
peak (approximately 1332 cm–1) is evident in all
samples, whereas the inset shows the background subtracted spectra
in the D and G band regions showing signs of broad D and G bands (around
1320–50 and 1580 cm–1, respectively). This
implies small changes in sp2 carbon with the largest D
and G envelope labelled at 1000 °C. In addition, the background
PL (bottom), taken as the intensity at 1200 cm–1, is loosely indicative of sample hydrogenation.

3.3 STEM–EELS
The C 1s spectra
of the core electrons in the diamond particle are shown for the untreated
sample in Figure 4.
The edge at approximately 293 eV corresponds to the electron transitions
to the σ* orbitals for sp3 carbon, which is typically
within the range of 289–294 eV.26,27 Furthermore,
the π* peak, characteristic of sp2 carbon and usually
situated at lower binding energies of around 285 eV, was not found,
indicating no measurable sp2 layer on this particle. Although
a survey of the powder sample revealed no evidence of sp2, that is, not to say that it is not present, it is merely in such
low volume concentrations of the bulk powder that it is difficult
to identify; whereas XPS is able to identify because of a larger sample
probing spot.

Figure 4 STEM–EELS of the annealed diamond powders at different
locations
on a particle. The arrow denotes the direction from the surface inward
into the particle. No evidence of any sp2 carbon was found
at various points on the initial untreated samples. The annealed samples
showed sp2 carbon layers with approximate thicknesses of
10, 45, 105, and 35 nm for 600, 800, 1000, and 1200 °C, respectively.

For the 600 °C sample, a
π* peak is found at lower binding
energies to the σ* edge on the surface of the particle. At 800
and 1000 °C, the amplitude of the π* peak significantly
increases and decreases again at 1200 °C with position. The trace
sp2 layer thickness can be estimated by varying the position
where the spectrum was recorded on the edge of the particle, as shown
by the STEM images in Figure 4. Using a modification of the Cuomo expression25 to compensate that π* is not really zero
on diamond spectra, the sp2/sp3 carbon ratio
can be obtained as follows 3  where I is the peak
intensity
and x is the sp2/sp3 carbon
ratio, revealing that the 1000 °C sample has the largest estimated
sp2 thickness. Although these data are conclusive in determining
that sp2 bonding is present on the particle surfaces and
varies with the annealing temperature, it is still difficult to quantify
this as a representative measurement because it is dependent on the
local properties at the point where the spectra are obtained.

3.4 SEM
The SEM measurements are shown
in Figure 5. The purpose
of these measurements is to demonstrate that the particle size and
morphology do not differ greatly as each of the powders are annealed.
It is clear that the overall particle size and geometry of the particles
do not change, and hence any differences in the XPS, Raman, or MCP
measurements will be due to an electromagnetic property of the material.
This measurement is important as any significant geometrical changes
in the particles can potentially affect the MCP measurements; different
particle shapes produce different electric dipole moments owing to
local electric field modifications rather than material property variations,
and the observed measurements of the effective (i.e., measured) complex
permittivity will vary accordingly.

Figure 5 SEM of the annealed diamond powders. There
are no drastic changes
in the particle size or morphology, thus reducing the geometrical
effect on MCP measurements.

Thus far, it has been determined that the graphitization
of these
particles increases with the annealing temperature and the particle
geometry does not change, however, the 1200 °C sample does not
follow the annealing trend; further discussion on this is in section 4. Having such well-established
material properties allows us to make firm correlations with the microwave
complex permittivity measurements.

3.5 MCP
The MCP measurements of the effective
dielectric constant, dielectric loss, and loss tangent (tan δ)
are shown in Figure 6. The first two are calculated using eqns 1 and 2, whereas the loss tangent is simply
achieved by taking the quotient of the imaginary and real parts 4  See the reference
for more details on the
experimental setup.40 The effective values
here mean that no attempt has been made to calculate the intrinsic permittivity of the powder material using effective medium theory
or by normalizing using the density, as is done in ref (40), as we expect the trends
to be visible in the measured data and any changes in the bulk density
across the sample to be immeasurable.

The results show that
the dielectric constant has minimal correlation with any of the other
measurements; in accordance with 1, the dielectric
constant is proportional to the shift in the frequency and is depicted
in the MCP traces in Figure 6 by the various frequency shifts from the unperturbed measurement
(quartz sample container). The loss tangent, however, varies in the
same manner as the measurements obtained using XPS (D-value and C 1s shift), EELS (C 1s sp2 carbon layer thickness),
and Raman spectroscopy (approximate D- and G-band regions), with an
increase from 600 to 1000 °C as well as the unexpected decrease
in loss at 1200 °C. Dielectric loss is depicted by an increase
in the bandwidth as per 2, though easier to
identify on the trace is the loss tangent, which is shown as a decrease
in the transmitted power within the resonator (therefore, the sample
introduces an insertion loss as it perturbs the electric field of
the resonant mode). These findings demonstrate that the measured microwave
absorption in these diamond powders is strongly related to an increasing
sp2 carbon volume or sample hydrogenation and is not due
to any changes in the size or shape, corroborating results found in
previous studies.29

Figure 6 Frequency-dependent effective
dielectric constant (top left), loss
(top right) and loss tangent (bottom left) from 2.5 to 9.5 GHz, measured
using MCP. Error bars are the standard deviation from four measurements
of the sub-micron diamond powders. The permittivity is relatively
frequency independent, however, a measurable increase in the dielectric
loss tangent as the sample is annealed is shown, peaking at 1000 °C
and decreasing at 1200 °C. A typical MCP trace (bottom right)
of the TM020 mode also shows this.

The loss tangent is also displayed as a function of the frequency
over the 2.5 to 9.4 GHz range in Figure 6. The observed frequency dependence of the
loss tangent is minimal; however, there are some small variations
in the general trend. The starting powder has the lowest loss tangent
with minimal frequency dependence. As the sp2 concentration
increases, a negative gradient with the frequency starts to emerge,
most prominently at 1000 °C. The general increase in tan δ
is related to the volume increase in non-diamond carbon impurities,
and an inverse frequency dependence can be modelled as an enhancement
in the long-range, free-charge conduction; as described in the previous
work, we expect that tan δ ≈ σstatic/ωε0εeff,1, where ε0 is the free space permittivity and σstatic is the long-range, free-charge conductivity.24 The presented data here are not significant enough to be
attributed to any noticeable long-range charge conduction. It is worth
noting here that the standard deviation error bars denote error between
the different prepared samples and not across the band. The overall
frequency-dependent characteristic was found to be similar among all
samples; thus, the error bars are more indicative of absolute offsets
in the whole data.

4 Discussion
The most
pertinent outcome of these experiments is that the MCP
dielectric loss tangent correlates with all other measured findings
from two contributions, sp2 carbon concentration and the
extent to which the sample is hydrogenated.

For the case of
a varying sp2 carbon concentration,
the unclear Raman results must first be discussed. Initially, the
absence of clear D and G bands in the Raman spectra suggests that
graphitization has not occurred at any of the temperatures, especially
because the excitation wavelength of the laser is in the near-IR region
and is therefore particularly sensitive to the presence of sp2 carbon.30 However, this would
disregard all of the XPS and EELS measurements, which suggest that
the sp2/sp3 carbon ratio is changing. A more
reasonable explanation is that the vacuum annealing process introduces
small volumes of sp2 carbon impurities, spuriously distributed
on the diamond crystallites, as verified by EELS. These volumes are
so small that discernible D and G bands cannot be detected, but instead
a broad feature encompassing both of them is measured. An indication
of sp2/sp3 carbon concentration from Raman is
generally given through either the peak ratio of the G band and the
diamond peak or a ratio of the integration of their respective areas.45 Through observation, it is clear that the broad
feature in Figure 3 inset between 1300 and 1600 cm–1 peaks at 1000
°C, however, the accuracy is heavily dependent upon the arbitrary
classification of the Raman baseline level. For the sizes of the particles
used here, they are much larger than those used in other annealing
studies (5–50 nm range28), and so
the sp2 growth rate is dramatically slower, producing a
much smaller volume fraction of sp2 carbon. The sensitivity
of Raman spectroscopy in this case is heavily weighted toward large
volumes of periodic and crystalline contributions. Typical penetration
depths of near-IR lasers are on the order of micrometers, whereas
XPS and EELS are point surface techniques with probing depths in the
nanometer range, making Raman spectroscopy more sensitive to the bulk
particle. This explains why both XPS and EELS measurements are more
capable of detecting a changing sp2/sp3 carbon
concentration in this sample set. However, MCP also probes the bulk,
but unlike Raman spectroscopy, it is much less sensitive to the insulating
crystalline diamond contribution, and hence a correlation between
the sp2 indicators from XPS and EELS and MCP is found.

The counter argument for the observed changes in the MCP results
is in the sample hydrogenation. This may have occurred from water
vapor present on the chamber walls prior to the annealing stages,
which is fully conceivable as per vacuum annealing experiments by
Ginés et al.47 As is shown in the
XPS O 1s/C 1s ratio and the Raman rising PL background, these hydrogenation
indicators show that with increasing annealing temperature, the sample
is further hydrogenated until it saturates at 1000 °C and decreases
at 1200 °C. Hence, a correlation similar to that of the sp2 indicators is obtained, and one could argue
that the measured increase in the microwave loss tangent is a consequence
of hydrogenation, namely hole conduction from the ambient surface
conduction phenomenon in hydrogenated diamond.44 Hydrogenated diamond has been demonstrated to drastically
affect the dc conductivity of pure diamond, decreasing the dc resistivity
from 107 to 105 Ω cm, and thus σ
= 1 mS/m.44 The low-frequency long-range
conductivity of the untreated powder has been measured in our previous
work40 giving a similar value, implying
that these samples are already hydrogenated before treatment, congruent
with the initial PL background in Figure 3. Because both sp2 carbon and
hydrogenation indicators are present, the question is, which
mechanism is most likely to have a larger impact on the microwave
dielectric properties?

In this work, we assume that
the electrical properties of sp2 carbon are far superior
to that of hole transport in hydrogenated
diamond. This is a reasonable hypothesis, graphitic carbon is known
to have a very high dielectric loss tangent in the microwave frequency
range and so microwave measurement systems are highly sensitive to
this material.48 This is a significant
result, with the correlation between the D-value
and loss tangent shown in Figure 7. For the XPS D-value, a simple linear
model can be used to quantify the surface sp2 carbon concentration
in trace amounts, giving a small percentage increase in sp2 carbon from approximately 17–31% after annealing, as shown
in Figure 7. With MCP
plotted against this, tan δ of 0.016 is extrapolated to 100%.
The error bars in Figure 7 show that the sp2 concentration can be resolved
with a maximum standard deviation of ±5%. However, it must be
made clear that the linear model given in Figure 7 is not linear at higher concentrations than
those measured here (less than approximately 31%) because applying
it to previously measured nano-diamonds yields sp2 concentrations
of greater than 200%.40 Comparing the MCP
standard deviation of ±5% with XPS, fine scans achieved with
0.1 eV resolution translate to a conservative 2% sensitivity for a
0–100% sp2 range of 13.7–21.2 eV.24 Whereas XPS in this regard is more sensitive
than the MCP system used here, the setup of MCP is much simpler. The
MCP system can also be improved by designing a higher quality factor
cavity resonator; for example, by increasing the conductivity of the
cavity metal by using copper instead of the currently used aluminum
cavity and by allowing greater changes in the bandwidth to be measured
for tan δ measurements.

Figure 7 MCP measurements of the dielectric loss tangent
of the annealed
diamond particles with the XPS and EELS measurements (top). Correlation
of MCP and XPS (bottom) is shown with the second y axis labelled as sp2 concentration because this is linearly
related to the D-value (using 0% at 13.7 eV and 100%
as 21.2 eV24). Error bars in the x direction indicate the standard deviation for the sample
measurement at 2.5 GHz, whereas the y direction shows
these same errors translated onto the sp2 concentration
axis, thereby showing the error in the measurement of sp2 concentration using the MCP approach.

Regarding the 1200 °C sample, which did not exhibit
as much
sp2 carbon as the 1000 °C sample, it has seemingly
shown the completely opposite result to what was anticipated; its
inferred sp2 concentration from XPS, EELS, and MCP measurements
did not increase at temperatures higher than 1000 °C, the Raman
PL background reduced to values similar to the starting material,
and its dielectric loss characteristic as a function of frequency
marginally increases, as opposed to decreasing as per the inverse
frequency dependence in the long-range conduction model.40 The observed increase in the dielectric loss
with increasing frequency is intriguing, as conventionally, one would
only observe such increases when a material’s permittivity
approaches dielectric relaxation. However, this is generally complemented
with a decrease in the real part of the permittivity with frequency,
which is not observed. One explanation for the anomalous 1200 °C
sample is related to the water vapor on the chamber walls at the start
of the experiment in that the sample is saturated with the desorbed
hydrogen at 1000 °C to the point that at a higher temperature
of 1200 °C, this hydrogenation facilitates in etching off the
sp2 bonding. The sp2 carbon growth kinetics
is less reported for diamonds approaching the micrometer size as opposed
to those readily used to synthesize nano-sized onionlike carbon (<10
nm).28,49,50 Regardless
of the obscure growth kinetics for this diamond sample at this temperature,
the XPS, Raman, EELS, and MCP results are all correlated, and so this
discrepancy does not affect the overall conclusions of this work.

5 Conclusions
The MCP measurements shown here demonstrate
that trace amounts
of sp2 carbon impurities on sub-micron-sized diamonds can
be detected with standard deviation errors as low as ±5%. The
microwave loss tangent demonstrates a linear relationship with the
sp2 concentration, with surface sp2/sp3 carbon ratios of up to 31% obtained using the XPS D-value. Additional indicators also verified the presence of a varying
sp2 carbon ratio, including changes in the XPS C 1s spectra,
EELS C 1s spectra, and a small and broad region encompassing the D
and G bands in the Raman spectra. In addition, varying hydrogenation
was detected in the particles through a rising PL background in Raman
and a varying XPS O 1s/C 1s ratio. This needs further investigation,
in particular, at a fixed sp2 carbon concentration, to
understand its effect on MCP measurements. Practically, this work
demonstrates potentially new avenues in materials science using microwave
dielectric spectroscopy for quality control in the production of sub-micron-sized
diamond powders. However, when used in isolation, one must exercise
caution because it does not identify phases within a material and
should be used in complement to others.
