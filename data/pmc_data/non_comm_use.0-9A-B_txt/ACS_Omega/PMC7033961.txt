We
report on the design, fabrication, and characterization of an
all-dielectric one-dimensional (1D) resonant device formed by a silicon
nitride grating impregnated by a low-index magneto-optical silica-type
matrix. This impregnation is realized through the dipping of the 966
nm periodic template in a sol–gel solution previously doped
with CoFe2O4 nanoparticles, and able to fill
the grating slits. By a proper adjustment of the geometrical parameters
of such a photonic crystal membrane, simultaneous excitation of transverse
electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarization resonances
is nearly achieved at 1570 nm. This TE/TM phase-matching situation
leads to a fivefold enhancement of the Faraday effect in the resonance
area with an increased merit factor of 0.32°. Moreover, the device
demonstrates its ability to enhance longitudinal and transverse Kerr
effects for the other directions of the applied magnetic field. Taking
benefits from the ability of the nanocomposite material to be processed
on photonic platforms, and despite its quite low magneto-optical activity
compared to classical magnetic materials, this work proves that an
all-dielectric 1D device can produce a high magneto-optical sensitivity
to every magnetic field directions.

Introduction
Magneto-optical (MO) interaction between
light and a magnetized
material is employed in photonics devices, which finally relates to
sensing,1−3 light modulation,4 or
optical nonreciprocity.5,6 Depending on the orientation of
the magnetization compared to that of the light plane of incidence,
these devices capitalize differently on MO interaction: through the
modification of the light polarization for the Faraday effect in transmission
and longitudinal/polar Kerr effect in reflection (L/PMOKE), or through
light intensity modification for transverse Kerr effect (TMOKE).7 Whatever the functionality, the development of
efficient MO devices usually faces two difficulties.

First,
since the magnitude of MO effects is quite low, it is challenging
to reduce the footprint of integrated MO devices and scale the size
required to be embedded onto photonic platforms. A large area of research
is thus devoted to the enhancement of MO effects, which can also be
employed to increase the sensitivity of MO sensors. Several strategies
have been proposed by research groups to enhance the MO effects. Currently,
a large part of this activity is based on plasmonic resonances obtained
in metallic materials combined with MO materials, or in ferromagnetic
metals. For example, surface plasmon resonance in a one-dimensional
(1D) gold grating placed on top of a magnetic film has been used to
produce high enhancement of the TMOKE for transverse magnetic (TM)
propagation.8,9 Combined with transverse electric
(TE) waveguide mode resonance in the garnet film, this plasmonic effect
has also led to a large enhancement of the Faraday effect10 through an energy exchange between the two modes,
which boosts the MO polarization conversion. Another concept is based
on extraordinary optical transmittance basically obtained in a two-dimensional
(2D) metallic grating. Associated with a MO layer, these systems have
mainly led to large enhancements in the Faraday rotation in the transmission
mode.11−14 Finally, when the metallic grating is placed inside the core MO
layer, electromagnetic-induced absorption (EIA) phenomenon is also
a way to produce a large increase in the Faraday effect.15 Apart from plasmonic effects, resonant effects
based only on dielectric materials are also attractive because of
their reduced intrinsic absorption, which has an impact on the quality
of resonance. Thereby, resonant enhancements of the MO effects have
been obtained through the sub-micrometric periodic patterning of dielectric
MO materials either as 1D/2D planar structure,16 as photonic crystals17,18 or periodic waveguide
devices.19 MO materials can also be periodically
arranged as 1D or 2D gratings with a low- or high-index material to
obtain MO enhancement through waveguide-mode resonant20 or electromagnetically induced transparency.21 Several reviews give a large understanding of
this area of research.22−24

However, a large part of these works relies
on numerical simulations
and there are few experimental demonstrations. This is due to the
second limitation of the development of MO devices mentioned previously.
Indeed, yttrium garnet oxides, which are the most efficient MO materials,
are very challenging to process and pattern on photonic platforms25 because of their lattice mismatch with photonic
substrates and the high-temperature annealing required to be MO active.26 Even though great progress has been made on
the monolithic integration of such materials,27 other strategies employ surface bonding onto silicon and III/V laser
substrates,26,28 or novel MO materials.15,29,30 Thus, concerning the enhancement
of the MO effects with surface devices, few experimental demonstrations
that exist were largely obtained with a metallic grating placed on
top of a garnet film. Belotelov and co-workers have used such devices
to prove the enhancement of the Faraday effect10 and TMOKE.8 More recently, Floess
et al. demonstrated the Faraday rotation as large as 14°, with
a device thickness as low as 139 nm. Based on EIA, the device consists
of a gold grating embedded in a EuS core layer at 20 K.15 In another area of wavelength, Tamagnone et
al. proved the ability of graphene metasurfaces to enhance the Faraday
effect at few tetra hertz.31 In the photonic
range, experimental demonstrations of the enhancement of magneto-optical
effects with an all-dielectric surface are not common, and, to the
best of our knowledge, no current device has been proved to enhance
different MO effects.

This work addresses these different challenges
with the objective
of realizing an all-dielectric 1D planar device able to enhance both
the Faraday and Kerr effects at 1.5 μm. As a MO material, a
nanocomposite made of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles
(NPs) embedded in a silica matrix is employed because of its proven
ability to be integrated on photonic platforms,30 or processed as three-dimensional (3D) photonic crystals.18 The objective was to associate this composite
with silicon nitride as a high-refractive-index material and form
a 1D photonic-crystal membrane.32 Concerning
the design, the strategy was to adjust the optogeometrical parameters
of such a membrane to obtain an overlap of TE/TM photonic band edges.
Thereby, TE and TM waveguide modes can be strongly coupled to each
other by the MO activity of the composite material, leading to an
increase of the Faraday and longitudinal Kerr effects, as they involve
the conversion of orthogonal polarizations. Furthermore, the TM waveguide
mode resonance can be employed to produce an enhanced TMOKE.

Results
and Discussion
The schematic of the device under consideration
is given in Figure 1. It consists of
Si3N4 nanostrips with a refractive index of
1.95, which alternates with a lower-index MO composite, forming a
1D periodic membrane on the BK7 substrate. The thickness of the device
(593 nm) is enough to ensure the presence of waveguide modes for both
polarizations (TE and TM) of around λ = 1.55 μm. The 966
nm period, Λ, is suitable to obtain a coupling of the incident
light to these modes: β = kx + mK (1), where β is the propagation
constant of a guided mode, kx = 2π sin θ/λ (2) is the incident
wavevector, and K = 2π/Λ is the grating
vector. Other parameters to be fixed are the width of the Si3N4 strips and the refractive index of the composite. The
simultaneous excitation of TE and TM resonances at normal incidence
require a proper combination of both these parameters and thickness.33 Fine adjustment of the strip width being technologically
not easy, a great advantage of the composite approach is that the
refractive index of the MO material can be tuned by varying the amount
of NP used to dope the initial sol–gel preparation (see Methods). Thus, from the 608 nm value of the strip
width obtained after lithography processes, an optimal refractive
index of 1.64 has been calculated by RCWA simulations. It corresponds
to an NP volume fraction of 15% in the matrix. Based on these results,
the 1D Si3N4 grating template has been impregnated
with a sol–gel solution containing a suitable quantity of CoFe2O4 NPs previously crystallized during a co-precipitation
process in water.34 The device is finally
submitted to soft thermal annealing at 100 °C, leading to a MO
refractive index of 1.69 (see Methods).

parameters. (b) Magnetic field directions used for measurements and
RCWA calculations. (c) Transmittance of the device measured and calculated
at normal incidence. (d) Color map of the device transmittance calculated
under TM and TE polarized illuminations as a function of the wavelength
and incident angle. Incident angle axis has been reversed for TM to
highlight the TE/TM resonance overlap at normal incidence.

Figure 1 shows
both
TE and TM dispersion diagrams through the 2D plot of the calculated
transmittance of the device as a function of the wavelength and incident
angle. As explained by Alasaarela et al.,35 such a calculation is a straightforward way, often used by researchers,
to plot the dispersion relation of waveguide grating guided modes.
Indeed, due to the coupling effect of the grating (2), varying the
incident wavevector angle is a way to vary the wavevector β.
These plots evidence the presence of photonic band gaps for both polarizations
with upper and lower bands. For a 1D photonic crystal membrane, the
waveguide imposes a different dispersion relation for TE and TM with
different band gap edges. However, by properly adjusting the geometrical
parameters of the membrane, band edges could be made to coincide.32 Our design strategy has led to this situation
since at normal incidence the upper TM band at 1571 nm almost coincides
with the lower TE band at 1588 nm. Such an overlap fits well with
the enhancement of MO effects. Indeed, as explained by Belotelov et
al.,10,11 enhanced polarization conversion like the
Faraday effect arises when the edge of the photonic band gaps for
TE and TM polarizations coincide because the two modes can efficiently
exchange energy (phase-matching condition), and the flattening of
the bands at the edges reduces the light group velocity and increases
the light–matter interaction.22

Figure 1 also compares
the experimental TE and TM optical transmittances with the theoretical
ones for normal incidence. One can see a good agreement between theory
and measurements. Furthermore, experimental TE and TM resonances are
close to each other: 1564 nm (TM) and 1582 nm (TE), i.e., a mutual
separation of 18 nm. It can nevertheless be noticed that the narrowness
of the theoretical dips (in TM, particularly) leads to shallower and
wider dips in practice. This can be explained by the inhomogeneities
of the MO gratings (surface roughness and irregularities in the impregnation
and grating parameters). The spectral resolution of the spectrophotometer
close to 2 nm can also explain the measured depth of the dips. The
main point is the overlap between both polarization resonances, which
is not fully optimal but really significant and finally constitutes
the basis of MO enhancements.

Enhancement results are first
reported for the Faraday effect in Figure 2 through a comparison
of the experimental and calculated saturated Faraday rotation (FR)
θF at a normal incidence for both
polarizations. These MO measurements have been carried out with a
homemade spectral polarimeter, which includes a calibration process
useful to obtain the absolute values of both rotation and ellipticity
of polarized light (see Methods). In this
configuration, the magnetic field direction is perpendicular to the
plane of the device (see Figure 1). The spectral area of interest, between 1450 and
1650 nm, is the most relevant for CoFe2O4 NPs
because an active transition assigned to Co2+ ions in a
tetraedric configuration produces a significant MO effect in this
area.36

RCWA numerical calculations.
Normal incidence Faraday rotation spectrum plotted with transmittance
for each polarization, and related figure of merit (FOM). The reference
sample is a MO film with a thickness of 593 nm.

A comparison of the FR of the device with that of the reference
homogeneous MO film evidences an enhancement effect that occurs due
to the presence of different FR peaks close to the spectral positions
of both polarization resonances. As expected, the close proximity
of TE and TM resonances allows an efficient MO coupling between TE
and TM guided-mode resonances. For TE polarization, the FR reaches
two maxima: one positive (0.49°) at 1579 nm, close to TE resonance,
and one negative (−0.33°) at 1562 nm, close to TM resonance,
whereas FR is −0.13° for the reference thin film. In absolute
terms, this rotation is multiplied by 3.5. As for the TM polarization,
the resonance produces a sign inversion of FR. These curves also evidence
a very good agreement between experimental and calculated values,
not only regarding the spectral behavior but also the magnitude of
the effects. Small differences may originate from slight deviations
of technological parameters, or from the angular and spectral resolutions
of the light beam employed in the MO setup (see Methods).

In spite of these enhanced rotations taking place in the
resonance
area, the transmittance value may be reduced at the FR resonance peak,
especially for the main TE FR peak. Regardless, in the case of a sensor,
it is not always required to have a high optical intensity; however,
it may be the case for other applications. Thus, it is relevant to
analyze the trade-off between the transmittance and the Faraday rotation
through its figure of merit commonly expressed as13  For both polarizations, the FOM
off-resonance
values of the device, about −0.13°, are identical to that
of the reference film. For each polarization, FOM possesses different
resonant peaks due to both polarization resonances. The maximum value
is 0.32° for the TE incident light at 1580 nm, which is three
times that of the reference. In Table 1, this value is compared to others selected in the
literature and obtained with planar 1D or 2D MO devices. Concerning
experimental realizations, the best value of 5.8° was obtained
by Floess et al15 with a 1D magneto-plasmonic
employing a large field of 5 T and a very low temperature of measurement
(20 K) required to obtain a magneto-optical activity of the EuS film.
With the same kind of structure, but employing a BIG film at room
temperature, Chin et al.10 could reach
a FOM of 0.48°. The value of 0.32° obtained in this work
is close to the one obtained by Chen et al, but it has been obtained
with a really low magneto-optical activity. Indeed, the off-diagonal
element of the CoFe2O4 composite is 0.0037,
whereas it is 0.016 for BIG and 0.074 for EuS (see Table 1). Concerning numerical studies
mainly led on 2D MO devices, the FOM varies from 7.35° with an
all-dielectric device to 0.01° with a plasmonic membrane employing
cobalt. For the latter, even if the FOM is quite low, the device presents
a large sensitivity to the surrounding material index, which is useful
for sensors. The value of 0.32° obtained in this work is within
this FOM range; however, all of these numerical studies have been
led with a larger MO off-diagonal element.

realizations whereas the three others (italic) relate to numerical

Finally,
these comparisons evidence that even if the material employed
in this work has low magneto-optical activity, the realized device
could reach an interesting FOM value. It proves the potentiality of
such an all-dielectric 1D membrane, presenting low absorption losses
compared to the metal-based structure, to efficiently enhance the
magneto-optical effects. Furthermore, with a better overlap between
TE and TM resonances, the FOM should reach 0.7°.33

To complete this analysis of the Faraday effect of
the device,
the spectral behavior of the Faraday ellipticity is reported in Figure 3 in the case of a
TE normal incident light. Compared to that of the reference film,
which shows a slight increase in the wavelength area, the Faraday
ellipticity of the device presents different resonance peaks with
a sign inversion at the TE resonance position. One can also note a
very good agreement between experimental and calculated curves.

rotation (KR) measured in transmittance configuration for several

transmission and reflection configurations, with TM polarization (incident
angle: 2.6°).

Figure 3 reports
the spectral behaviors of the longitudinal and transverse Kerr effects
of the device. LMOKE has been carried out with a magnetic field lying
in the plane of the device, and perpendicular to the grating slits,
for different angles of TM incidence (from 0.8 to 2.5°). In this
configuration also, optical resonances produce a large enhancement
of the MO effect with a peak whose magnitude and position depend on
the angle of incidence. The maximum is 0.37° at 1565 nm for an
incidence angle of 1.2°. Comparing the experimental and simulated
curves, one can see that the shapes are well preserved, despite a
spectral shift toward low wavelengths.

The TMOKE has been measured
through the difference in the intensity
signal between the opposite directions of the transverse magnetic
field. Due to the experimental limitations of the electromagnet in
this configuration, the applied magnetic field is limited to 200 mT
as opposed to 800 mT for other effects (see Methods). Nevertheless, an enhancement of the TMOKE is demonstrated in either
transmission or reflection, with a mutual coherence of the corresponding
experimental and simulated curves. Evidently, the TMOKE measured in
the transmission is larger than that measured in reflection, as predicted
by the simulation. As the TMOKE only relies on TM polarization, the
overlap of TE and TM resonances is not required; however, due to the
presence of a large TM optical resonance, the enhancement of the TMOKE
occurs like in the case of magneto-plasmonic devices.8

Finally, since TMOKE is an intensity effect, whereas
the effect
Faraday and LMOKE are the effects of the rotation of polarization,
such a device may be used as magnetic sensors to measure different
components of the magnetic field with enhanced sensitivity.

To conclude, enhancements of the Faraday effect, LMOKE, and TMOKE
have been experimentally demonstrated on a Si3N4 membrane impregnated with a magneto-optical composite made of the
CoFe2O4 NPs. The results obtained in this work
are mainly based on the simultaneous excitation of TE and TM resonances
through a proper choice of geometrical parameters of the dielectric
grating. For the Faraday effect, the FOM reaches 0.32°, which
is a value close to that obtained by other research groups mainly
led on magneto-plasmonics devices, even if the magneto-optical activity
of the composite is lower. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first time that three different magneto-optical effects have been
successfully demonstrated with significant enhancement within an optical
component from planar technology. In addition, these results are obtained
on a single all-dielectric grating, whereas works dedicated to such
enhancements in the literature commonly employed magneto-plasmonic-based
devices.

Methods
Fabrication of the Si3N4 grating template
was subcontracted to the University of Joensuu (Finland). The first
step was the deposition of a 593 nm thick silicon nitride layer on
the BK-7 substrate. Then, electron beam lithography and reactive ion
etching were performed to obtain the 1D template with a 966 nm period.
This elaboration method ensures a very good homogeneity of the pattern
over the 5 by 5 mm surface of the device. AFM investigations evidence
a Si3N4 line width of 608 nm and a grating depth
of 623 nm. Compared to the initial layer thickness, this last value
indicates that the BK7 substrate has been also etched over about 30
nm. Then, the silicon nitrite refractive index was measured by ellipsometry
outside the etched area. Around 1550 nm, the obtained value is 1.95,
with a low dispersivity and an undetectable absorption.

Impregnation
has been realized by dip-coating this template in
a liquid sol–gel preparation doped by magnetic nanoparticles.
This solution was obtained by the mixture of tetraethyl-orthosilicate
(Si(OC2H5)4/TEOS), chloridric acid,
ethanol, and water (see ref (36) for details.). To provide a magneto-optical feature to
the final silica matrix, magnetic CoFe2O4 nanoparticles
dispersed as ferrofluid in water are added to the solution. The amount
of NPs governs the magneto-optical activity as well as the refractive
index of the final nanocomposite material.36 After the dip-coating, thermal annealing at 100 °C is performed
for 1 h. Using the optogeometrical parameters, the RCWA investigations
were performed to determine the optimal refractive index value required
to obtain a perfect TE/TM phase-matching condition. This optimal value
is 1.64. The amount of NPs has been adjusted to reach this value,
and ellipsometric measurements led to an area without Si3N4 grating evidenced a refractive index of 1.69 + i0.006, not exactly but not so far from the targeted value.
The volume fraction of particle in the nanocomposite is thus 15%,
which corresponds to an off-diagonal permittivity tensor element of
εMO = 0.0015 (−2.5i + 1.2).

Optical numerical simulations were carried out using MC GRATINGS,
a RCWA (Rigorous Coupled Waves Analysis)-based commercial code,37 and the MO simulations were made with a homemade
RCWA code taking into account the whole permittivity tensor.38 The Fourier modal method (FMM) or RCWA is the
most suitable numerical method to solve Maxwell’s equations
and analyze the interaction of electromagnetic waves with periodic
diffractive structures.39

Transmittance
measurements were carried out on a Carry5000 spectrometer
with a spectral resolution of 2 nm from Agilent Technologies.

The magneto-optical behavior of the device was investigated at
room temperature using a homemade polarimetric optical bench, based
on a modulation technic combined with an ellipsometric-type calibration
method (see ref (18) for details). This system mainly employs a xenon white light source
(combined with a monochromator to select the wavelength with a spectral
resolution of about 7 nm), a polarizer, a photoelastic modulator,
an analyzer, a detector, and a lock-in amplifier. Such an optical
arrangement is suitable to analyze the polarization state of light
(rotation, ellipticity) by means of the first and second harmonic
signals of the LIA.40 The calibration method41,42 allows us to measure the absolute value of the polarization rotation
with a detection limit of 0.001°. The calibration coefficient,
which gives the ellipticity, is not precise enough in the wavelength
range to finally obtain an absolute value. During the measurement,
the sample is submitted to an external magnetic field, which can vary
from 0 to 0.8 T. Thus, each MO effect (Faraday or Kerr) was measured
as a function of the field through a hysteresis loop curve. The saturated
value is then plotted as a function of the wavelength. In terms of
angular resolution, as the beam emerging from the white light source
has to be focused on the sample, the incident light possesses a cone
angle of the order of 3°.
