Development
of resistance to antibiotics is one of the major reasons
of difficulties in treatments of diseases caused by antibiotic-resistant
bacteria, and this resistance makes the investigation of alternative
antimicrobials a key priority. Phenolic acids are plant- and fungi-originating
natural antimicrobial products, and there is no known bacterial resistance
after exposure to them. The purpose of this study was to investigate
the resistance ability of bacteria against phenolic acids. Therefore,
the ability of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus to gain resistance against two phenolic
acids and an antibiotic upon exposure to subinhibitory concentrations
was tested. Herein, we evaluated the minimum inhibitory concentrations
(MICs) of vanillic acid (VA), 2-hydroxycinnamic acid (2-HCA), and
vancomycin in the beginning of the experiment and the MICs were found
to be 2.5 mg/mL VA, 1.6 mg/mL 2-HCA, and 0.01 mg/mL vancomycin for
both bacteria. Following continuous treatments with increasing subinhibitory
concentrations, MICs were evaluated once more. Exposure to subinhibitory
concentrations of vancomycin induced the development of resistance
immediately; however, resistance to both phenolic acids could not
be induced. These data indicated the potential of phenolic acids to
be used as effective antimicrobials in the inhibition of antibiotic-resistant
pathogenic bacteria.

==== Body
1 Introduction
One of the major health
and economic problems of all countries
is the spreading of resistance against antibiotics.1−3 Extreme misuse
of antibiotics in humans and animals has lead to the development of
antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Although there is a possibility that
bacteria are intrinsically resistant to some of the antibiotics, they
can overcome the probable susceptibility by several mechanisms.4 Antibiotics mostly inhibit the bacterial growth
by acting on the synthesis of the cell wall, the cell membrane, proteins,
DNA, and RNA.2,3 Apart from these classical targets,
another action mechanism of antibiotics is resulting in reactive oxygen
species formation which then affects the structure and stability of
lipids, proteins, and DNA of the bacteria.2 The ability of bacteria to develop resistance against antibiotics
can be due to mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer, selection
of previously resistant strains among the population, and mutagenesis.2,5−7 Studies reported that the exposure to subinhibitory
antibiotic concentrations not only induces resistance but also affects
the virulence factors of the human pathogens which may lead to a rise
in illnesses and deaths.8,9 The accelerating pace
of resistance to antibiotics poses crucial problems worldwide from
the points of human health and increased costs of treatments caused
by infections.2,4,10 In
2013, about two million infections with antibiotic-resistant bacterial
strains which then directly resulted in the death of about 23 000
people were reported in the USA.3,4 Besides, it is estimated
that about 1.5 billion Euros are disbursed in Europe.4

Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive
bacterium that naturally can live on the human skin and in the nasopharynx.11−13 It is a global major source of infections caused by bacteria. Staphylococcal
infections can vary from skin infections, such as boils and abscesses
to toxic shock syndrome and mortal pneumonia.12−15 Although about 30% of all people
asymptomatically carry S. aureus, its
presence is related with the infections occur subsequently.5,13,14S. aureus is able to develop resistance against multiple antibiotics.11−14,16 and these resistant strains are
responsible for many epidemics and pandemics. Among others, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is known as the most common pathogen
that has resistance against multiple antibiotics.4 The presence of MRSA both as hospital-associated and community-associated
strains carries these bacteria to the top of the list of healthcare
problems.17 According to the literature,
methicillin resistance is observed in more than 60% of S. aureus isolates and the development of resistance
to more than 20 of antimicrobial drugs has been achieved in many strains.16 The ability to gain resistance against almost
all the antibiotics in use is one of the main reasons that make the
treatment of S. aureus infections more
difficult. This resistance then leads to an increase in the cost of
the treatments and the loss of labor.17,18 Therefore,
the investigation and development of effective antimicrobial agents
against antibiotic-resistant bacteria has vital importance worldwide.13 According to the literature, although about 80% of the pharmaceuticals were produced from plants,
not much is used for their possessed antimicrobial properties. This
situation prompts the screening of plant-based materials to find the
novel antimicrobial agents.1

Phenolic
compounds are produced by the plants and fungi as secondary metabolites. They
are consumed in human diet and beneficial to human health due to their
antioxidant,19,20 anticarcinogen,21 anti-inflammatory,21,22 and antiviral23 properties. Recent studies indicated their neuroprotective24 and radiation-mitigating25 properties. They also have antibacterial activities which
were commonly shown in many studies.10,13,26−29 Vanillic acid (VA) and 2-hydroxycinnamic acid (2-HCA)
used in this study are phenolic acids made of an aromatic ring that
is attached with hydroxyl groups. Antimicrobial and antioxidant properties
of phenolic acids are determined by the hydroxyl groups’ position,
number, and also by the presence of other groups attached to the ring.26 Plant-based simple phenolic acids are classified
in two major groups: hydroxybenzoic acid and hydroxycinnamic acids.
While VA is a derivative of hydroxybenzoic acids;22,30 2-HCA is a derivative of hydroxycinnamic acids.26

The aim of our study was to test the resistance development
ability
of multidrug resistant bacteria against VA and 2-HCA and to determine
the possible difference against phenolic acids among two S. aureus strains for the first time. Herein, we
report that MRSA and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) did not develop resistance to both VA and 2-HCA whereas the
two strains developed resistance to vancomycin.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Determination of Subinhibitory
and Minimum
Inhibitory Concentrations
Antimicrobial properties of VA,
2-HCA, and vancomycin on MRSA and MSSA were determined via a macro
dilution method. The effect of different concentrations of phenolic
acids against MRSA and MSSA were presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Growth of MRSA and MSSA in the presence of different
concentrations
of VA (a,c) and 2-HCA (b,d). The absorbance measurement was taken
at 600 nm at 0th, 8th and 24th time points during incubation at 37
°C.

The minimum inhibitory concentrations
(MICs) and subinhibitory
concentrations were given in Table 1. MICs of tested antimicrobial agents were found as
2.5 mg/mL for VA; 1.6 mg/mL for 2-HCA, and 0.01 mg/mL for vancomycin
for both organisms. Subinhibitory concentrations for phenolic acids
were same for MRSA and MSSA: 1.3 mg/mL for VA and 1.2 mg/mL for 2-HCA.
However, vancomycin concentrations showed differences, while 0.005
mg/mL vancomycin resulted in the inhibition of about half of MRSA;
it was 0.0075 mg/mL vancomycin in the case of MSSA. These concentrations
were used as starter concentrations to induce the resistance ability
of bacteria.

2.2 Effect of Exposure to Subinhibitory
Concentrations
of Phenolic Acids and Vancomycin
The antibiotic resistance
not only results in serious health problems but also loss of labor
due to the hospitalization of infected people and increased costs
of treatments. When compared with the infections caused by antibiotic
susceptible strains, the infections caused by resistant ones lead
to about a twofold increase in deaths.10 Vancomycin is an intravenous antibiotic used for the treatment of
infections caused by the community acquired or hospital acquired MRSA.11,14 However, it does not provide a complete solution due to the occurrence
of bacteremia and nephrotoxicity during antibiotic treatment, high
incidence of treatment failures, and emergence of resistant strains.14 Several studies showed the increased resistance
to vancomycin upon exposure of bacteria to inhibitory concentrations.31−33 In our study, after determination of the antibacterial effect of
VA, 2-HCA, and vancomycin on MRSA and MSSA, the induction of resistance
was promoted with the incubation of bacteria within the subinhibitory
concentrations of tested antimicrobial agents for 24 h. At the same
time, MRSA and MSSA were exposed to previously determined MIC concentrations
of these antimicrobials to confirm the obtained MICs shown in Table 1. Transfer of bacteria
from media containing subinhibitory concentrations of antimicrobials
to freshly prepared media containing an appropriately incremented
concentration of antimicrobials resulting in a difference in percent
inhibitions of same concentrations at the end of the 48 h incubation.
While there was no difference in the MIC concentrations of VA and
2-HCA after the first increment, both MRSA and MSSA rapidly developed
resistance to vancomycin (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Growth of MRSA (a) and MSSA (b) in the presence of VA,
2-HCA and
vancomycin after the first increment in concentrations of antimicrobials.
Data represent the mean (±SD) of two independent experiments.

Consistently with the literature,31 one
of our findings was that vancomycin resistance developed not only
in MRSA but also in MSSA, indicating that a difference in resistance
to one type of antibiotic did not confine bacteria to develop resistance
to other one. According to Figure 2, treatment of both bacteria with vancomycin elevated
the MIC values. Even though both MRSA and MSSA were treated with 0.015
mg/mL vancomycin, it was not enough to inhibit the bacterial growth
after 48 h incubation period. To assess whether incubation time affects
the resistance profile of bacteria on antibiotic and phenolic acids,
another increment in the concentrations was done. This time, transferred
bacteria were grown in the presence of slightly increased subinhibitory
concentrations of antimicrobials for 72 h (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Growth of MRSA (a) and MSSA (b) in the presence
of VA, 2-HCA and
vancomycin after the second increment in concentrations of antimicrobials.
Data represent the mean (±SD) of two independent experiments.

As expected, the development of resistance to vancomycin
was observed
for both bacteria but not the subinhibitory concentrations of phenolic
acids. After second incrementation in subinhibitory concentrations,
bacteria were able to grow in the presence of vancomycin concentrations
and reached to 0.015 mg/mL as shown in Figure 3. While 0.02 mg/mL vancomycin was required
to inhibit total growth of MRSA, it was not enough to inhibit total
growth of MSSA when the incubation period was protracted to 72 h.

The determination of MICs for VA, 2-HCA and vancomycin on MRSA
and MSSA before, during and after exposure to subinhibitory concentrations
allowed the investigation of the ability of bacteria to develop resistance
against increasing subinhibitory concentrations. In contrast to antibiotic
treatment, challenge of both bacteria with VA and 2-HCA did not result
in acquisition of resistance. Moreover, although vancomycin susceptibility
of MRSA and MSSA changed following exposure of subinhibitory concentrations,
no difference between MRSA and MSSA was observed in the case of their
phenolic acid susceptibility as shown in Table 2.

a This count does belong to 0.01 mg/mL
for vancomycin which was obtained as initial MIC.

Transfer of bacteria that had been
grown in media containing subinhibitory
concentrations of antimicrobials for 6 days (144 h continuous exposure)
to antimicrobial-free TSB (tryptic soy broth) media provided the information
whether the increased MIC values for vancomycin were stable or not.6 All MRSA and MSSA cultures transferred to the
antimicrobial-free environment were able to grow in the TSB which
were consistent with the information that none of the obtained MIC
value was bactericidal against MRSA or MSSA (Table 2).

The determination of final MIC values
displayed that the MICs which
were elevated for vancomycin following the continuous exposure to
subinhibitory concentrations were remained elevated. Additional 48
h incubation in the absence of the antimicrobials did not change the
response of bacteria in terms of the acquired resistance to vancomycin.
Because there was no increase in the MICs for phenolic acids at the
end of continuous exposure, no difference in the MICs was observed
neither for MRSA nor MSSA after additional 48 h growth in TSB.

Treatment of bacteria with subinhibitory concentrations of vancomycin
resulted in different elevated levels of antibiotic resistance for
MRSA and MSSA after additional incubation in an antimicrobial-free
environment. While 0.015 mg/mL vancomycin inhibited the total growth
of MRSA, the same concentration resulted in an incomplete inhibition
of MSSA. MIC of vancomycin was found as 0.025 mg/mL for MSSA (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Growth of MRSA (a) and
MSSA (b) in the presence of VA, 2-HCA, and
vancomycin after exposure to subinhibitory concentrations. Data represent
the mean (±SD) of two independent experiments.

The second significant finding of this study was that even
bacterial
cultures were transferred to an antimicrobial-free environment they
maintained their resistance and susceptibility profiles to vancomycin
and phenolic acids. Interestingly, there was difference for increased
MIC values for bacteria following continuous exposure to subinhibitory
concentrations (Figure 3) and after additional growth in an antibiotic-free environment (Figure 4). This difference
might be due to the effect of the increased incubation period in the
presence of antibiotic. Longer time might be required to generate
more resistant strains in the population.

The percent inhibitions
of treatment concentrations of all antimicrobial
agents and the confirmation of the MIC values at the beginning and
at the end of the transfer series, and after each increment are listed
in Table 3. While the
percent growth inhibitions of the bacteria in the presence of subinhibitory
phenolic acid concentrations remained similar, the subinhibitory vancomycin
concentration lose its effectiveness on both bacteria after the first
transfer. Moreover, our results showed that the prolonged exposure
to both phenolic acids increased the inhibitory effect on both bacteria
(Table 3).

Interestingly,
continuous exposure of bacteria with 2-HCA resulted
in the increased susceptibility (from 46% growth inhibition to 75%
growth inhibition) to that antimicrobial at the end of the transfer
process, while the bacterial growth percentage was similar to a previous
inhibitory effect for VA. This might be related with the chemical
differences in the structures of phenolic acids. The observed difference
in our results showing elevated MIC values for MRSA (0.015 mg/mL)
and MSSA (0.025 mg/mL) might be due to the presence of a subpopulation
that are already resistant to vancomycin. Also an enhanced resistance
might be explained with the presence of the internal plasmid that
carries the transposon responsible for vancomycin resistance.14

Our results showed that the method used
in this study was convenient
for studying the induction of resistance because the experimental
procedure did not result in the adaptation of bacteria to the presence
of antibiotics and allowed the development of resistance. Any differences
among the determined MICs for used antimicrobials reported in previous
studies could be due to working with different strains, difference
in the initial concentration of bacteria, use of different methodological
approaches, or preparation of solutions. Use of different solvents
for the complete solution of phenolic compounds in different concentrations
might have an effect on MIC determination.10,34,35

The third and the most significant
finding of our study were for
antibacterial effects of phenolic acids. Inhibitory effects of phenolic
compounds on pathogenic bacteria have been shown in the literature.13,19,20,29,36 The action mechanisms of different phenolic
compounds were also studied and their interaction with RNA and protein
synthesis,29 their interaction with genomic
DNA,40 and membrane structure and function13,26 were determined. However, the previous studies showing a similar
phenomenon in which the bacteria develop no resistance against the
tested agent are limited with a few antimicrobial compounds. Along
these lines, the study performed by Blair (2009) that includes the
experimental steps our study is based on showed that pathogenic bacteria
were not able not develop resistance against subinhibitory concentrations
of Leptospermum honey, while they rapidly
acquire resistance to antibiotics.37 Apolonio
(2014) and his colleagues evaluated the antimicrobial resistance induction
in S. aureus, MRSA and Listeria monocytogenes strains against continuous
exposure to eugenol and citral. They did not observe resistance development
for these two essential oils upon continuous exposure for the testes
strains.38 A more similar example was shown
by Takahashi (2015) in which an important food-borne pathogen L. monocytogenes acquired no resistance to ferulic
acid upon treatment with subinhibitory concentrations.39

This study has focused on not only the
antibacterial activity of
VA and 2-HCA on MRSA and MSSA but also the maintenance of the antibacterial
activity in terms of induction of resistance. Here, we have shown
for the first time that the antibacterial activity of both VA and
2-HCA were maintained upon continuous exposure to subinhibitory concentrations
regardless of the type of phenolic acid, duration of incubation period,
and antibiotic resistance profile of S. aureus. Because the development of the resistance against antibiotics commonly
gained by the acquisition of one responsible gene among bacteria,
it seems unlikely to develop resistance against phenolic acids due
to complex action mechanisms. According to the literature, phenolic
acids inhibit bacterial growth by several action mechanisms such as
changing membrane permeability, changing potassium efflux from the
cell, causing nucleotide leakage,28 changing
bacterial surface charge,26 binding to
proteins,10 and binding to DNA.40 Although there are phenolic compounds degrading
bacteria in the environment, especially in the soils,41−43 studies showed that different enzymes and activation of several
metabolic pathways were needed to metabolize phenolic acids. Considering
what is known about phenolic acid action mechanism and phenolic acid-metabolizing
mechanisms of bacteria and their native niches, it seems that there
is minimal risk for MRSA and MSSA to gain resistance against phenolic
acids in the near future.

3 Conclusions
This study highlighted the importance of phenolic acids as alternative
antimicrobial compounds by showing that even antibiotic-resistant
bacteria, namely, MRSA and MSSA, were not able to develop resistance
to them. Therefore, the findings obtained from our study supported
the idea of the usage of phenolic acids to fight against pathogenic
bacteria. However, further data are required to determine the exact
potential of phenolic acids to be used in treatments of illnesses
caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Micro-organism and Culture Conditions
The following strains were used in this study: methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (39) N315 type II SCCmecA and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) (28) ATCC 29213. Bacteria were maintained
on tryptic soy agar (TSA) and broth (TSB) (Sigma-Aldrich 22092). Both
strains were grown by the inoculation of a single colony of bacteria
on TSA or in 4 mL TSB and overnight incubation at 37 °C without
shaking (NuVe). The observation of the desired concentrations of overnight
bacterial cultures was done via spectrophotometric measurements and
viable cell count methods.

4.2 Preparation of Phenolic
Acids and Vancomycin
For the determination of the antimicrobial
effect of phenolic acids,
VA (abbreviated as VA) (Sigma-Aldrich 94770) (synonym: 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoic
acid), and 2-HCA (abbreviated as 2-HCA) (Sigma-Aldrich H22809) (synonym: o-coumaric acid) were used. Solubility of phenolic acids
in TSB media was increased by the addition of 0.6% of dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) (Sigma-Aldrich D5879) as a final concentration into the phenolic
acid solutions. Bacterial growth was not affected by the presence
of 0.6% DMSO final concentration in the medium (data not shown). The
tested concentrations for all antimicrobial agents were freshly prepared
prior to experiments. The stock concentrations of VA and 2-HCA were
prepared as two-fold of the intended highest concentration. Although
the concentrations of the compounds seem higher when compared with
antibiotics, the ODs of the antimicrobials alone did not get effected
by the concentrations (the spectrophotometric absorbance measurements
of 2.5 mg/mL VA, 1.6 mg/mL 2-HCA, and 0.01 mg/mL vancomycin were 0.1022,
0.1034, and 0.1010, respectively; while TSB alone was measured as
0.1013 at 600 nm at the end of the 24 h incubation period).

Vancomycin (Vancotek, Koçak Farma) was dissolved in double
distilled water (ddH2O) (as 10 mg/mL stock concentration)
and sterilized by filter sterilization using 0.2 μm pore-sized
filter and stored at −20 °C.

4.3 Determination
of Minimum Inhibitory and Subinhibitory
Concentrations
The MIC and subinhibitory concentrations of
vancomycin, VA, and 2-HCA, were determined via the broth macro-dilution
method with some modifications.44 Briefly,
the concentrations of all antimicrobial agents were freshly prepared
in TSB media. Final test concentrations were ranged between: 0.001
and 0.05 mg/mL for vancomycin, 0.8–2.5 mg/mL for VA, and 0.8–2
mg/mL for 2-HCA. Addition of inoculum from the overnight culture as
2:100 into the tubes resulted in final bacterial concentrations of
5 × 106 cfu/mL for MRSA and 1 × 107 cfu/mL for MSSA. The time of inoculation of bacteria into the media
containing different antimicrobial concentrations was accepted as
the initial time point for the spectrophotometric measurement and
optical density (OD) was taken at 600 nm (Spectrophotometer, Thermo).
After 24 h incubation at 37 °C, the OD measurement was repeated
and MICs were determined for each antimicrobial agent. MIC tests were
repeated at least two times. Subinhibitory concentrations were accepted
as the concentration that inhibits about half of the bacteria after
24 h growth. Percent inhibitions in the growth rates of micro-organisms
were calculated according to the following formula: 100 × 1 –
(test group OD/control group OD), where the test group OD corresponded
to bacteria treated with antimicrobial compound concentrations and
control group corresponded to the untreated bacteria grown under normal
conditions. The determined initial MIC and subinhibitory concentrations
for both organisms (prior to exposure to subinhibitory antimicrobial
concentrations) were listed in Table 1.

4.4 Enumeration of Bacteria
The determination
of viability in the test tubes that contain antimicrobial agent or
not was done by spreading 0.1 mL of serially diluted bacteria from
each tube onto TSA plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. A
viable cell count allowed the determination of bacterial number in
the test tubes at the beginning and at the end of the process of exposure
to antimicrobials. To be able to compare the effect of the exposure
to subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations, first, bacteria grown
under normal conditions were tested with the mentioned (subinhibitory
and MIC) concentrations of all antimicrobials. Their inhibitory effect
on bacterial growth as well as the viable number of cells was recorded.
Then, the bacterial culture grown in the subinhibitory concentrations
of the antimicrobials were transferred into the freshly prepared antimicrobial
compounds which have slightly increased concentrations (1st and 2nd
increments) and were allowed to grow for an indicated incubation period
(Table 1). Following
these transfers, bacteria were incubated in antimicrobial-free TSB
for 48 h. Then, these bacteria were transferred into the TSB containing
initially determined concentrations (MIC and subinhibitory concentrations)
of antimicrobial compounds for 24 h. The inhibitory effect of the
antimicrobials and the number of viable cells were noted once more.
The comparison of viable cells subjected to the same antimicrobial
concentration prior to continuous exposure and following the exposure
was shown in Table 2.

4.5 Exposure to Subinhibitory Concentrations of
Phenolic Acids and Vancomycin
The inducement of resistance
against VA, 2-HCA, and vancomycin was based on the study of Blair37 with some modifications. The determination of
resistance development to VA, 2-HCA, and vancomycin was started with
the addition of 2% inoculum from an overnight culture of bacteria
into the media containing both subinhibitory and inhibitory concentrations
of all tested antimicrobial agents (Table 1). The control groups were MRSA and MSSA
grown in TSB media without the addition of any antimicrobial agent.
Following 24 h incubation at 37 °C, 2% inoculums from the cultures
containing a subinhibitory concentration of antimicrobials were taken
and subcultured into freshly prepared phenolic acid and vancomycin
solutions (4 mL total volume) that had 0.1 mg/mL increment for phenolic
acids and 0.0005 mg/mL increment for vancomycin in the concentration
(Table 1). To test
the development of resistance to the antimicrobial agents, MICs were
retested with each transfer by using previously determined and increased
concentrations of the corresponding antimicrobial agent. MICs were
increased with increments of 0.2 mg/mL for phenolic acids and 0.005
mg/mL for vancomycin. The cultures were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C
and the same process was repeated with second increments in the concentrations
for 72 h incubation. After 72 h incubation, 2% inoculums from the
cultures containing increased subinhibitory concentrations, MIC and
increased MIC of antimicrobial agents were transferred into TSB media.
48 h incubation in this antimicrobial-free media provided a demonstration
of whether increased MIC values were stable or not. After the 48 h
incubation period in TSB, MICs for MRSA and MSSA were retested for
resistance to phenolic acids and vancomycin. The experiments conducted
for testing resistance development were performed with two biological
repeats.
