Continuously
variable thickness porous anodic aluminum oxide (PAAO)
films were obtained using electrochemical oxidation of bulk aluminum
sheet while both electrodes were simultaneously withdrawn from the
electrolyte solution. The thickness gradient was controlled by the
withdrawal rate (1–10 mm/min range) and thickness variation
demonstrated from below 50 nm to above 1 micrometer. The thickness
increased linearly with the sample lateral coordinate, whereas the
nanopore structure (diameter and interpore distance) remained unchanged.
Effects of the initial pore growth and capillary forces are discussed.
The presented method can be used for tuning optimal PAAO thickness
for optical and other applications as exemplified by finding maximum
plasmonic scattering in structured Al–PAAO–Au multilayers.
Enhanced scattering from porous gold film separated by a specific-thickness
PAAO layer from aluminum mirror surface is demonstrated.

1 Introduction
Multilayer systems comprising
of a reflective metal substrate,
dielectric layer, and a layer of plasmonic nanostructures (nanoparticles
or nanoholes in metal film) have recently attracted considerable attention1−10 for their potential applications including refractive index sensors,
surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), anti-counterfeiting technology,
color printing, or displays. The optical properties of such multilayers
are governed by an interplay of structural Fabry–Pérot
like resonances, plasmonic effects, and near-field coupling between
neighboring nanostructures. Additional functionality can be discovered
if the dielectric layer contains cavities, such as pores in porous
anodic aluminum oxide (PAAO) membranes. Resonators with open pores
can for example be used for colorimetric detection of various molecules.11,12

Production of well-defined nanostructured layers typically
employs
lithographic methods, which are able to control the feature geometry
in the two lateral dimensions. Studies of effects of structural variations
in the third dimension often require production and characterization
of many similar samples, which can be a tedious task and prohibitively
expensive. The desired thickness range of dielectric layer in metal–insulator-nanostructured
metal systems can vary from few nanometers for SERS applications6 to several micrometers for infrared resonators.7

In this work, we present a method for the
production of continuously
variable thickness PAAO films, which maintain their two-dimensional
surface structure while the thickness can be tuned from approximately
50 nm to well above optical wavelengths on the same sample. The PAAO
surface serves as a template for subsequent deposition of thin metal
films with nanohole arrays, which show enhanced plasmonic scattering
at specific PAAO thickness values.

The method is based on well-established
anodization protocols of
aluminum, which produce self-organized porous films, where pore diameters
(tenths of nm) and center-to-center distance (tenths to hundreds of
nm) can be selected by choice of electrolyte and anodizing potential.13 The desired thickness may be difficult to achieve
due to initially unstable alumina growth phase,14 PAAO growth rate dependence on temperature,15 and often unknown crystallographic orientation
of the underlying aluminum substrate.2 Here,
we achieve variable thickness PAAO on the same sample by gradually
terminating the oxidation by reducing electrolyte immersion depth
during anodization in sulfuric and oxalic acid electrolytes.

As an application example of variable thickness, the PAAO membrane
we demonstrate enhanced the plasmonic scattering from nanohole arrays
in a thin Au film that are created by sputtering of Au on the PAAO
surface. Plasmonic resonances in a sub-50 nm diameter holes in a thin
gold film can be difficult to observe due to relatively small extinction
cross section. In Al–PAAO–Au multilayers, plasmonic
absorption can be noticed as subtle change in the reflection spectra.2,4 Here, we show that the resonant scattering from nanopores in gold
film can be easily detected under angled illumination for specific
values of PAAO thickness. This enables the application development
based on a new plasmonic structure nanohole on mirror, which is a
natural extension of the particle over mirror6 concept with the advantage that exceptionally dense nanohole arrays
can be produced on a large scale using self-organizing processes without
a need of lithography or other sophisticated techniques.

2 Results and Discussion
A number of samples were prepared
using different pull-out speeds Vsub using
sulfuric and oxalic acid electrolytes.
The sample regions with a deeper initial immersion are exposed to
longer anodization times and consequently have a larger PAAO thickness.
The top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Figure 1) from regions near both ends
(with significant thickness difference) of the sample reveal that
pore diameters (30–50 nm for oxalic acid and 20–25 nm
for sulfuric acid electrolyte) remain constant throughout the sample.
This result agrees with the observations during stationary pore growth
using fixed electrodes where the pore size is determined by anodization
voltage and electrolyte.13 The above-mentioned
diameter intervals account for local variations in pore size, shape,
and measurement uncertainty.

Figure 1 Top-view SEM images of (a) oxalic-PAAO at the
beginning (top) of
sample, thickness hPAAO = 190 nm; (b)
sulfuric-PAAO beginning of sample, hPAAO = 150 nm; (c) oxalic-PAAO at the end (bottom) of sample, hPAAO = 370 nm; and (d) sulfuric-PAAO end of
sample, hPAAO = 470 nm. Both samples were
anodized at Vsub = 4.6 mm/min.

Figure 2 shows the
representative cross-sectional images of the oxalic-PAAO coated with
a thin Au layer taken at different sample locations that correspond
to different anodization times. One can observe that the pores below
the outer layer are straight, with a constant diameter and at a local
scale (nanometer to micrometer) resemble the structures of PAAO membranes
obtained using fixed electrode anodization. To check the deposited
Au film morphology, the film was transferred to poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS) surface and Al-PAAO substrate removed by chemical etching.
The resulting film has bumpy surface with holes (Figure 2d) that match the PAAO surface
structure.

film with holes of the same sample after removal of Al substrate and
PAAO layer.

The obtained PAAO thickness
grows linearly with lateral sample
coordinate (regions with fitted lines in Figure 3), which correspond to stationary pore growth.
However, deviations from the linear behavior are observed at the beginning
of anodization, where pore growth is terminated before the establishment
of stationary process. Further, the last, of approximately 2 mm, has
a nearly constant thickness because the anodization takes place in
the meniscal region when the sample is practically above the electrolyte
surface, yet the liquid bridge remains due to capillary effects. The
anodization is terminated simultaneously in the entire meniscus area,
when the capillary bridge eventually breaks.

Figure 3 PAAO thickness dependence
on lateral coordinate for oxalic and
sulfuric PAAO anodized at different electrode withdrawal speeds.

The demonstrated PAAO thickness
variations in 50 nm to micrometer
range on the same sample are of interest for optical applications.
At higher withdrawal rates, tuning in sub-50 nm thickness range would
be possible. At lower withdrawal rates or using longer electrodes,
the thickness could be increased far above the optical wavelength
scale. To better understand the PAAO thickness profile, one has to
consider the kinetics of current in electrodes that change their surface
area during anodization (Figure 4). The process can be divided in three phases.(i) In the initial phase,
which is characterized
by a high starting current that rapidly drops to a certain minimum
and after ≈20–30 s recovers to a local maximum, the
barrier layer is formed and pore formation starts. The kinetics of
this phase is essentially identical to PAAO growth using a fixed-electrode
setup.13,16

(ii) During the steady pore growth phase,
the current gradually decreases due to continuous electrode area reduction.
In this phase, the film with the desired thickness gradient is formed.
Although the PAAO thickness is determined by current density and process
time, for practical purposes, it is of interest to estimate the PAAO
thickness as a function of position on the sample. Assuming a constant
PAAO growth rate Vg (typically 1.5–2
nm/s), the PAAO thickness increases linearly with anodization time t and sample lateral coordinate x = Vsubt + b,
where b accounts for variation of immersion depth
and uncertainty of meniscus shape at the initial stage. For a sample
immersed about 14 mm deep and withdrawn at Vsub = [1, ..., 5] mm/min, this results in ≈10 mm long
zone with a continuous oxide growth.

(iii) In the final stage, the anodization
takes place in the capillary meniscus region and is characterized
by a faster reduction of anodization current. This process continues
until eventually, the capillary bridge breaks and the current drops
to zero. In this phase, the linear relation between anodization time
and PAAO thickness is no longer valid because the ion flow is hindered
by the confined meniscus volume.



Figure 4 Typical current
dynamics recorded during anodization with retracting
electrodes from different electrolytes and withdrawal velocities.
The intervals (i–iii) represent different phases of thickness-gradient
anodization, see text.

Without the hexane layer (see Experimental
Section), the electrolyte meniscus would rise several millimeters
above
the surface. In fact, this effect together with the impeded reaction
rates at the upper (thinner) part of the meniscus can be used to obtain
continuous gradient PAAO films in the 10–100 μm range.17 In our case, the meniscus formation is limited
to ≈2 mm and sub-micrometer thickness gradient films are obtained
by electrode withdrawal within few minutes. At the last millimeters
of the sample (phase iii), the capillary forces modify the balance
between the bulk electrolyte volume and the meniscus volume anodization
and the linear PAAO thickness dependency on lateral coordinate no
longer holds.

If the anodization would be
performed during dipping rather than
withdrawal, the meniscal region would continuously remain in the initial
anodization phase, characterized by a high current density.18 However, this approach increases the risk of
local breakdown, likely caused by inhomogeneities of the natural passivation
layer that leads to local heating and uncontrolled oxidation.

In the reflected light, variable thickness Al-PAAO structures behave
as expected and show a weak rainbow coloring caused by thin-film interference.
The color saturation is significantly improved when PAAO is coated
with a thin (semitransparent) layer of material with a substantially
different dielectric permittivity, e.g., carbon19 or metal,9 a 20 nm Au film in
the present study. Figure 5a shows the reflection spectra from selected locations with
different PAAO thickness of an Au-coated oxalic-PAAO sample (photograph
in Figure 5c). The
spectral dependence of reflection on PAAO thickness (Figure 5d) is governed by the interference
of partial reflections on all interfaces. The occasional spectral
jumps in Figure 5d
are most likely caused by grains of different crystallographic orientation
of aluminum sheet,2 used for anodization.
The majority of grains has (100) orientation20 and is characterized by higher oxidation reaction speeds (larger
PAAO thickness) relative to the less frequent (110) or (111) oriented
grains. Because the latter have a smaller PAAO thickness, they appear
with blue-shifted response in comparison to the spectra of the surrounding
dominant (100) grains. This could potentially be avoided using single-crystal
aluminum substrates. One may also notice that the evolution of the
reflection spectra with increasing lateral coordinate practically
stops at the bottom of the sample, which can be explained by a slower
anodization rate in the capillary meniscus of the electrolyte.

and PAAO thickness. (c) Photograph of the sample in reflected light
from a diffuse light source. (d) Pseudocolor images of reflection
intensity depending on the sample lateral coordinate x and wavelength of incident radiation. (e) Dark-filed photograph
and (f) scattering intensity map of the same sample.

Plasmonic effects in nanostructured multilayers1,2,4 are relatively weak in comparison
to interference
coloring and often can escape unnoticed in reflection spectra (Figure 5a,d). An associated
plasmonic phenomenon is resonant scattering, which can be observed
using dark-field imaging setup. Localized surface plasmon resonances
in the orange-red wavelength region are expected for gold films with
a short-range ordered arrays of nanoholes21,22 and depend on the pore diameter and density. The scattering intensity
spectra for porous gold films on different oxalic-PAAO layer thicknesses
are shown in Figure 5b,f. Ignoring the noisy regions in the violet and infrared, there
is a distinct scattering maximum at λ0 = 600 nm vacuum
wavelength occurring at 370 nm PAAO thicknesses. This is the key observation
that demonstrates the method of thickness optimization for maximizing
the scattering intensity. It would be very difficult to find this
combination using a series of fixed-thickness samples. The resonant
(enhanced) scattering in our case can also be seen by the naked eye
when observing the sample at an angle that does not allow direct reflection
from the light source (Figure 5e). Considering the effective refractive index n = 1.63 for PAAO,12 the 370 nm approximately
equals the full wavelength λ0/n.
Local maxima at λ0 = 600 nm can also be noticed in Figure 5f for PAAO thickness of 250 nm and anticipated for thickness
above 560 nm; however, a more accurate optical setup with well-defined
incidence angle, polarization, detector linearity, etc. would be required
to study these structures.

For an accurate modeling of optical
response, one would need to
consider the case of angled illumination in a multilayer system including
effective medium estimates for transition from aluminum to barrier
layer, PAAO, and Au layers. Due to lack of symmetry and excess of
subwavelength details, simulations of high-density (center separation
below 100 nm) short-range ordered plasmonic nanohole arrays can be
difficult. Even for less dense arrays, one has to resort to long-range
ordering with periodic boundary conditions.3 A further complication is that the Au film is not flat and a grating-like
coupling to electromagnetic radiation cannot be excluded. From the
hexagonal arrangement of holes in the Au film, one may expect a strong
angular dependency of coupling.23 However,
the ordered domains are small (≈500 nm diameter; Figure 2), randomly oriented, and lack
long-range periodicity.

3 Conclusions
A method
of continuous thickness gradient nanostructured alumina
film fabrication was presented. It can be applied to popular anodization
protocols in sulfuric and oxalic acid electrolytes. We have demonstrated
the applicability of the method for finding the optimal distance between
the aluminum surface and the nanostructured gold film for maximizing
plasmonic scattering. The developed method is perspective for further
studies of dense plasmonic nanohole arrays on dielectric coatings
of metals and may extend the concept of particle over mirror6 to nanohole over mirror with potential applications
in plasmonic sensing, SERS, and solar energy harvesting.24

4 Experimental Section
High-purity (99.999%) aluminum sheet (GoodFellow) with a thickness
of 0.25 mm, cut in 9 × 18 mm2 pieces, was used as
the starting material for sample fabrication. After degreasing in
acetone and isopropyl alcohol, the aluminum surface was electropolished
for 3 min at room temperature in a mixture of 60% HClO4 and C2H5OH (volumetric ratio 1:4) under applied
voltage 10–15 V.25

The first
anodization was done using well-known two-step protocols25 either using 0.3 M H2SO4 at 20 V anodizing potential for 1 h or 0.3 M C2H2O4 electrolyte with a 40 V anodizing voltage for
1 h. This was done at room temperature using aluminum anode and platinum
cathode two-electrode cell. The oxide layer after first anodization
stage was removed by a solution of H3PO4/CrO3 (11:4%) at 70 °C for 2 h.

The second anodization
was done with the same conditions as in
the first step, with the key difference that the electrodes were simultaneously
pulled out from the solution at a 1–10 mm/min rate (Figure 6). A relatively large
amount of electrolyte solution (>50 mL) was used to minimize the
change
in concentration and temperature. The anodizing process was continuously
monitored by recording the electric current and the immersion depth
of the anode electrode. The basic idea is that the pore growth terminates
in the sample region above the electrolyte surface. To reduce the
capillary effects and meniscus formation, the electrolyte was covered
with a 5 mm thick insulating and electrolyte repelling layer of hexane.
The anodizing process was allowed to continue until the aluminum electrode
plate was completely pulled out of the anodizing electrolyte. After
that, the sample was washed with deionized water and dried at room
temperature. The surface analysis of the porous anode was done using
a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi 4800).

Figure 6 (a) Schematic diagram
of anodizing cell. (b) Photograph of both
electrodes during withdrawal.

A 20 nm Au layer was deposited on the Al-PAAO surface using
the
coating system (GATAN 682 PECS, Ar ion beam, 5 keV energy, 240 μA
current, 0.8 Å/s, normal incidence, sample rotation 0.5 s–1), resulting in a thin film with a dense array of
20–30 nm diameter holes.2 The reflection
spectra were recorded using a fiber-coupled spectrometer (Ocean Optics
USB4000) connected to an inverted microscope (Olympus IX71) with a
10× objective lens (Olympus CPLNFLN 10XPH, NA 0.3) and a standard
microscope halogen lamp. The scattering spectra were recorded using
the same setup, except a sided illumination from a fiber-coupled halogen
light source (THORLABS OSL1-EC), 6.4 mm diameter aperture, placed
at 30 degrees angle relative to the sample surface and 2 cm distance
from the objective lens focus.

For a better SEM image contrast
of the actual holes in the Au film,
the film was transferred (facing upside down) to a PDMS (Sylgard 184
elastomer kit, Dow Corning) surface. After PDMS curing, the Al substrate
was dissolved in a CuCl2/FeCl3 mixture.26 Finally, the PAAO was removed by a 5% H3PO4 solution at 70 °C for 1 h and washed with
distilled water.
