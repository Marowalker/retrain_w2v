In this study, we systematically
investigated the phase separation
behaviors of polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/alkali lignin (AL)/dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) systems and found that the addition of AL causes phase separation
and the systems form sea (PAN)/island (AL) types of structures. Interestingly,
the AL-rich domains are very stable even after a long time of storage
up to 15 days. Additionally, how the phase separation affected the
solution rheology, the coagulation process and PAN cyclization were
explored. The addition of AL in PAN/DMSO solutions changes the solution
viscosity and gelation behaviors. Also, the existence of AL-rich domains
accelerates the coagulation rate of the PAN solution in water. Because
AL degrades at a lower temperature than PAN, it reduces the PAN cyclization
temperature but leads to a higher cyclization activation energy, which
could be caused by their different initiation mechanisms. These results
would be useful to understand how the addition of AL affects the PAN
solution structures, solution rheology, solution coagulation behaviors,
and PAN stabilization reactions.

1 Introduction
Because
of the increasing demands for biorenewable and eco-friendly
resources, natural biopolymers have been drawing more and more attentions.1 As mostly the byproduct of paper industry, lignin
is the second most abundant component in nature, which widely exists
in the cell walls of plants.2−5 Lignin contains a high content of carbon and could
be potentially used as a carbon precursor. Because of the low cost
and sustainability of lignin, many attentions have been paid to lignin-based
carbon materials.6−8 Among carbon materials, carbon fibers (CFs) have
drawn intensive attentions due to their high mechanical performances
and corrosion resistance. For lignin-based carbon fibers, the mechanical
properties are still low to be practically used.9−11 Hither to now,
the best tensile strength of neat lignin-based carbon fibers has reached
1.39 GPa, which is close but still lower than the target properties
for low-cost CF applications.12

Polyacrylonitrile
(PAN) is the predominant precursor for making
high-performance CFs.13,14 The cost of PAN contributes up
to 50% of CF products.15 Also, PAN is synthesized
from petroleum-based organics, which is not environmentally friendly
and also unsustainable.4 There are strong
desires for the applications of cheap, renewable, and environmentally
friendly natural materials in CF manufacturing.16 Owning to low mechanical properties of the lignin-based
CF, integrating the cost advantages of lignin and the good mechanical
properties of PAN attracts the attentions of many researchers.2,14,17 Although lignin could be melt
spun into fibers, PAN would decompose before melting; thus, solution
spinning is commonly adopted for making PAN/lignin composite fibers.
Oroumei et al. prepared the hardwood organosolv lignin-PAN composite
fibers, and the results indicated that lignin-based fibers had a high
carbon yield of above 50% at 600 °C, which is highly desired
for the production of low-cost CFs.2 Dong
et al. investigated PAN/lignin sulfonate blend fibers and found that
the precursor fibers could be stabilized rapidly without fusion.17 Jin and Ogale eliminated the macrovoids in the
lignin/PAN blend fibers typically generated during wet-spinning by
adding lignin in the coagulant bath.7 Park
et al. used a lignin-grafted PAN copolymer served as a compatibilizer
of PAN/lignin blends and greatly improved the specific tensile strength
and elastic modulus of electrospun carbon nanofiber (CNF) mats.18 The highest tensile properties of PAN/lignin
(70/30)-based carbon fibers were reported by Kumar et al. using novel
gel-spinning technology, and the obtained tensile strength and modulus
were 1.7 and 230 GPa, respectively.19 Overall,
the addition of lignin in PAN affects the carbon fiber processing
in many ways. The incorporation of lignin in PAN solutions leads to
reduced viscosity and poor spinnability.20 Also, because of the complexity of lignin, lignin/polymer blends
result in a porous structure and phase separation and limited mechanical
properties of the resulting CF.7,20,21 Additionally, the addition of softwood lignin could promote PAN
cyclization and cross-linking by lowering the corresponding reaction
activation energy.14

The phase diagrams
of the PAN/lignin/solvent system are expected
to strongly affect the rheology of the solution, material processing,
and stabilization of PAN. However, to our surprise, in these PAN/lignin
composite studies, their phase diagrams were rarely mentioned. In
our previous works, we have observed that the addition of lignin in
wet-spun PAN fibers led to a structural transition from solid to hollow.22,23 Our results suggested that the phase separation or solidification
of the PAN solution was accelerated after incorporating with alkali
lignin (AL), which promoted the formation of hollow structures and
porous walls. For the practical applications of PAN/lignin-based CFs,
the dispersion status of lignin in the PAN solution would definitely
affect its rheological behaviors, coagulations/phase separation, fiber/film
processing, and thermal stabilizations. Here, we prepared PAN/AL composite
solutions with various weight contents and systematically studied
the phase behaviors of the blends. Also, we systematically investigated
how the aggregation of the AL-rich phase affected the rheological
properties of the PAN/lignin/solvent system, coagulation behaviors,
and PAN cyclization.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 PAN/AL/DMSO System
To study the dissolution
of AL in different organic solvents, SEM and optical microscopy were
performed to explore their dispersion statuses. The SEM images of
as-received AL powders shown in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information show irregular shapes with a size
of tens of micrometers. As shown in Figure 1, PAN and AL could be homogeneously dissolved
in DMSO without visible agglomerations even at a high magnification
of 400×. Also, it could be observed that the undissolved irregular
AL fragments in DMF and DMAc have much smaller sizes than the as-received
AL particles. It is clear that AL could only be partially dissolved
in DMAc and DMF. Considering that the solution concentrations of AL
in DMAc, DMF and DMSO are the same, that is, 5 wt % (Figure 1A–C), it is safe to
conclude that the solubility of AL follows the order of DMSO >
DMF
> DMAc, which is consistent to the polarity factor of the solubility
parameters of these organic solvents.24

Figure 1 Optical
images of (A) AL/DMAc, (B) AL/DMF, (C) AL/DMSO solution,
(D) Sol-PAN, (E) Sol-AL2, and (F) Sol-AL5; (G) phase separation immediately
occurs when AL/DMSO (2 wt %) contacts PAN/DMSO (20 wt %).

From the above optical images, it could be found
that DMSO is the
good solvent for either AL or PAN. However, we found that phase separation
immediately occurs when the AL/DMSO solution contacted with the PAN/DMSO
solution (Figure 1G).
During the in situ optical observation, the well-dissolved AL/DMSO
and PAN/DMSO solutions were dropped on a glass slide closely, and
they were mixed together by covering a cover glass.

The PAN/AL/DMSO
composite systems were prepared, and the detailed
compositions and sample abbreviations are listed in Table 1. For AL/PAN/DMSO composite
systems, AL-rich domains form an individual spherical phase. There
are distinct boundaries between the PAN solution and individual lignin-rich
domains (Figure 1E,F);
it is obvious that AL and PAN are immiscible in DMSO, even though
either of them could be well dissolved. The diameter distribution
of the AL-rich domain is shown in Figure 2. It is noted that the diameter of the AL-rich
phase has a narrow distribution (PDI, ∼1.2).

after storage at (A1, A2) 30 °C and (B1, B2) 50 °C for 15
days.

To verify the dependency
of the diameter of the AL-rich phase on
storage times, we checked the time-dependent diameter changes of the
AL-rich phase of Sol-AL5 after storage at 30 and 50 °C for various
times. The diameter distributions of Sol-AL5 before and after storage
at 30 and 50 °C for 15 days are summarized in Figure 2, and the corresponding average
domain sizes are counted and summarized in Table 2. The AL-rich domains have a diameter around
∼5 μm. Normally, when phase separation occurs in a composite
system and the sea-island structure is formed, a coarsening of the
island phase would happen due to Brownian motion or Ostwald ripening.25 To our surprise, regardless the increase of
the storage temperature from 30 to 50 °C and storage time from
0 to 15 days, the diameters of AL-rich domains are very stable without
a noticeable increment.

To investigate the effects
of the addition of AL on the rheological
properties of PAN solution, the frequency-dependent G′ and G″ curves of PAN and PAN/AL/DMSO
systems were measured and are plotted in Figure 3. The G′ and G″ values of the solutions follow power law behaviors
in the low shear rate region, where G′ ≈
ωn1 (0 < n1
< 2) and G″ ≈ ωn2 (0 < n2 < 1), ω is
the angular frequency, and n1 or n2 is the exponential factor of storage modulus and loss modulus,
respectively. The power law exponents of Sol-PAN, Sol-AL2, and Sol-AL5
are 1.88, 1.78, and 1.74, respectively. Our previous studies have
found that the exponential factor n (n = n1/n2) represents the solution
homogeneity.26 On the basis of the exponential
index of n, the solution homogeneity decreases along
with the increase of the AL content in the solution. This decline
of the n value could be ascribed to the phase separation
in the PAN/AL/DMSO system or/and the possible dissolution of a small
portion of AL in the PAN continuous phase, which leads to a broader
molecular weight distribution.

Figure 3 Frequency-dependent G′/G″ values of various (A) Sol-PAN,
(B) Sol-AL2, and (C) Sol-AL5
measured at 30 °C.

The temperature-dependent G′ and G″ curves of PAN/DMSO solutions and PAN/AL/DMSO systems
during cooling and heating cycles are shown in Figure 4. For all solutions, a thermo-reversible
sol–gel transition was observed during the cooling cycle. For
Sol-PAN, when temperature decreased to 9.3 °C, the G′ and G″ quickly increased, and the
solution became gelled. With the addition of AL, the gelation temperature
slightly decreased from 9.3 °C to 6.5 °C and to 4.4 °C
for Sol-PAN, Sol-AL2, and Sol-AL5, respectively. It should be noted
that this sol–gel transition is not the crystallization of
the DMSO solvent, which has been explained and demonstrated in detail
in our previous articles.26 Meanwhile,
the reverse transition temperatures of Sol-PAN, Sol-AL2, and Sol-AL5
during reverse heating are 13.4, 13.1, and 13.1 °C, respectively,
which are very close. The optical images of PAN/AL/DMSO systems (Figure 1) exhibit an island-sea
type of phase diagram, and the majority of AL becomes phase separated.
The continuous phase is PAN that determines the major properties of
the composite systems. For a completed phase separation system, the
thermal transitions of the PAN continuous phase would not change.
Thus, the decrease of the gelation temperature along with the addition
of AL in the PAN solution suggests that a small portion of AL could
possibly be dissolved in the PAN continuous phase, which weakens the
interactions between PAN chains and leads to a lower sol–gel
transition temperature.

Figure 4 Temperature-dependent G′
and G″ curves of (A) Sol-PAN, (B) Sol-AL2,
and (C) Sol-AL5 during
the (1) cooling cycle and (2) heating cycle. The starting points are
noted by arrows.

During the heating cycle,
although no gelation occurs at a temperature
up to 90 °C, the dynamic moduli of the solution cannot be fully
recovered after the cycle and become much higher.26 On the basis of Eom’s and our previous works,27 the interactions among nitrile groups become
stronger during heating. These nitrile group couplings that are formed
during heating will not be fully disassembled during cooling, which
lead to higher moduli and tan(δ). For Sol-PAN, tan(δ)
increases from 0.05 to 0.10 after the heating cycle. This increase
suggests the solution become more elastic because PAN chains get more
entangled. The solution exhibits metastability during the heating
cycle. With the addition of AL, the recovery of the dynamic moduli
of the PAN solution after the heating cycle is significantly improved.
For Sol-AL5, it is found that G′ and G″ could be completely recovered after heating and
cooling cycles. Additionally, the complex viscosities (measured at
1 rad/s) of Sol-PAN significantly decrease from 59 to 25 Pa·s
with the addition of 2.5% of AL. All these changes indicate the partial
dissolution of AL in the PAN phase, which affects the rheological
properties of the PAN/AL/DMSO systems.

Finally, for storage
stability verification of PAN/AL/DMSO systems,
we kept PAN/AL/DMSO systems at room temperature for 2 months and measured
their rheological behaviors. The calculated n, complex
viscosity, and sol–gel transition temperature are summarized
in Table S1 in the Supporting Information.
After long time storage, no obvious rheological changes were found,
which proved their excellent life stability. The storage stability
is important for the real applications of AL in PAN solution spinning.
The existence of phase separation in PAN/AL/DMSO systems could be
detrimental to the mechanical performances of the resultant carbon
materials because the structural inhomogeneity could create defects
and lead to stress concentrations. However, in the other way, the
phase separation could also be utilized to create and regulate the
porous structures of the resultant PAN/carbon fibers and films to
achieve other functionalities.22,23

2.2 Coagulation
Behaviors
As shown in
the experimental part, two types of films were prepared from PAN/AL/DMSO
systems for comparison. The SEM images of the PAN/AL composite films
are summarized in Figure 5. It is seen that PAN/AL composite films are typical two-phase
incompatible systems. For dried films, EDS spectra were examined in
different positions (marked with numbers 1, 2, and 3 in Figure 5), and the elemental compositions
are listed in Table S2 in the Supporting
Information, which prove that PAN forms a continuous matrix and AL
forms the discontinued island phase in the composite films. There
is no nitrogen in the EDS spectrum of the isolated island phase, which
suggests that the AL-rich phase does not contain any PAN. For water-coagulated
films, both the surface and the sectional view clearly show many macropores
or channels in the films, which are created through the dissolution
of AL in water.

Figure 5 SEM images of PAN/AL composite films. Numbers 1 and 2
represent
the solvent evaporation method and coagulation method, respectively.
Letters A, B, and C represent films prepared from Sol-PAN, Sol-AL2,
and Sol-AL5, respectively. The numbers 1, 2, and 3 noted inside the
images are the collection points of EDS spectra.

The FTIR spectra of PAN and PAN/AL composite films prepared
by
the solvent evaporation method are plotted in Figure 6. The peak located at 2244 cm–1 is the characteristic peak of PAN, which belongs to C≡N groups.28,29 Because of the small amount of AL, only two distinct new peaks appear
at 1514 and 1597 cm–1 for PAN/AL composite films,
which were ascribed to the skeletal vibration of the aromatic rings
of AL.30,31 As the AL blend ratio increases, the IR
peaks at 1514 and 1597 cm–1 become stronger, which
indicate more AL in the composite film. Moreover, these characteristic
peaks do not shift after mixing PAN and AL, which indicate that no
direct interaction between PAN and AL molecules.

Figure 6 FTIR spectra of PAN/AL
composite films.

The glass transitions
of PAN were measured by DMA. The temperature-dependent
tan(δ) curves are shown in Figure S2A–C in the Supporting Information. The glass-transition activation energy
(Ea-glass transition) could
be calculated from the frequency dependent tan(δ) peak temperature
using the Arrhenius equation.32 The linear
dependent curves of log(f) and 1/Tg are plotted in Figure 7, where f is the measurement frequency
and Tg is the tan(δ) peak temperature
or glass-transition temperature. It is found that Ea-glass transition values of Film-C-P, Film-C-AL2,
and Film-C-AL5 are 166.8, 160.7, and 160.5 kJ/mol, respectively. From
rheological measurements, we conclude that a small amount of AL is
dissolved in the PAN continuous phase. The DMA measurements indicate
that the dissolved portion of AL in the PAN matrix must be very small
because the dissolved AL showed a little effect on the activation
energy of PAN matrixes.

Figure 7 Plots according to Arrhenius equation for glass
transition of PAN
and PAN/AL composite films.

For water-coagulated films, the dissolution of AL in water
leads
to the formation of macropores or channels as shown in Figure 5.2. During coagulation, the
upper surface of the film contacts with water first, and the lower
surface contacts with water latterly. For Film-C-P, perforative channels
are formed in between the upper and lower surfaces, while their surfaces
are flat, solid, and pore free. Meanwhile, with the addition of AL
in PAN solutions, macropores appear in the film surfaces, and a gradient
channel structure is formed. During water coagulation of PAN/AL/DMSO
systems, the out-diffusion of the isolated AL-rich domains is quick,
which leads to the formation of smaller diameter channels. For Film-C-AL5,
the channel diameter near to the upper surface is smaller than that
of Film-C-P. During water coagulation, these small channels that form
in the beginning merge together and form large channels near the lower
surface. Finally, a gradient channel structure is formed for AL-containing
PAN solutions. To prove above assumptions, we in situ observed the
water-induced solidification process using an optical microscope. Figure 8 shows time-dependent
optical images of Sol-PAN and Sol-AL5 coagulated by water. During
coagulation, channels are quickly formed. The red arrows in Figure 8 indicate the length
of the formed channels at a specific time. It is found that the channel
growth rate of Sol-AL5 (∼23 μm/s) is faster than that
of Sol-PAN (∼9 μm/s), especially in the beginning stage.
For Sol-AL5, AL domains can be quickly dissolved in water, and the
surrounding PAN solution would be fastly solidified; thus, the channel
formation will be faster than that of Sol-PAN. Also, the formed channel
of Sol-AL4 is smaller than that of Sol-PAN.

images of Sol-PAN and Sol-AL5 solutions

2.3 PAN Cyclization Kinetics
To analyze
the effects of AL on the stabilization kinetics of PAN, the DSC curves
were recorded for PAN, PAN/AL dried films, and coagulated films in
a N2 atmosphere, and the corresponding plots are summarized
in Figure 9. For water-coagulated
films, the AL component was completely washed off, and only PAN matrix
was left. The cyclization exothermic peaks of Film-C-P, Film-C-AL2,
and Film-C-AL5 are exactly the same as shown in Figure 9B. By comparison, the dried PAN/AL composite
films show obvious DSC peak temperature downshifts and peak shape
deformations (Figure 9A).

Figure 9 DSC curves of three samples in (A) dried films and (B) coagulated
films heat from 40 to 350 °C under N2 atmosphere at
a heating rate of 5 °C/min.

To further study the cyclization kinetics, we varied the
DSC heating
rates from 2.5 °C/min to 5 °C/min and to 10 °C/min.
Although Film-PAN only shows a single exothermic cyclization peak,13,28 PAN/AL blends exhibit two overlapped exothermic peaks (Figure 10). Peak fitting
was adopted to separate these peaks, and bi-Gaussian and Pearson VII
types of fitting peaks were used for the main peak (peak 1) and shoulder
peak (peak 2) to obtain the best fitting (Figure 10B1). The fitting results are summarized
in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information.

Figure 10 DSC
curves of PAN/AL dried films heat from 40 to 350 °C under
N2 atmosphere at (A–C) different heating rates.
Peak fitting analysis of DSC curves for Film-D-AL2 at (B1) a heating
rate of 2.5 °C/min.

The peak temperature, full width at half-maximum (FWHM),
and fitting
peak area percentage are listed in Table 3. With the addition of AL, the initialization
temperature of the PAN cyclization reaction occurs at a much lower
temperature, and the exothermic peak becomes broader. The main DSC
peak (peak 1) temperature of Film-D-PAN is 283.4 °C at a heating
rate of 5 °C/min, which decreases to 269.3 and 266 °C for
Film-D-AL2 and Film-D-AL5, respectively. Because water-coagulated
PAN/AL films show no peak temperature shift than the PAN film, this
temperature decrease suggests that the cyclization reaction in the
PAN matrix is affected by the addition of AL and suggests that a small
amount of AL must be dissolved in the PAN continuous phase, which
is consistent to our rheological results as discussed in the previous
section. Peaks 1 and 2 are ascribed to the cyclization of the PAN
matrix and PAN surrounding the AL domains, respectively. In Table 2, with the addition
of more AL, the peak 2 area percentage increases because more PAN
chains contact with AL domains. The PAN cyclization reactions could
be stimulated by the addition of AL, which could possibly lead to
a faster stabilization and reduce the corresponding processing cost.

The cyclization reaction
activation energy could be calculated
from the Ozawa method using the following equation33 1  where Ea is the activation energy, ϕ
is the heating rate, and TPeak is the
peak temperature. The corresponding
Ozawa plots are shown in Figure 11. The cyclization activation energy of Film-D-PAN is
115 kJ/mol. The DSC peak 1 in PAN/AL blends is caused by the cyclization
of the PAN matrix. With the addition of AL, it is found that the cyclization
activation energy increases to 153 kJ/mol for Film-D-AL2 and to 145
kJ/mol for Film-D-AL5. The existence of the small amount of AL in
the PAN continuous matrix affects the cyclization reaction of PAN.
Meanwhile, Clive Liu et al. reported that no new exothermic peak appears,
and the cyclization activation energy of PAN-co-MAA
decreases from 183.1 to 163.7 kJ/mol after incorporating softwood
kraft lignin.19 These differences could
be ascribed to the different types of PAN and lignin. The DSC peak
2 in PAN/AL blends is ascribed to the cyclization of PAN in the vicinity
of AL domains, and the activation energy increases to 173 kJ/mol for
Film-D-AL2 and to 248 kJ/mol for Film-D-AL5. The significant increments
of the cyclization activation energy after incorporating AL in PAN
suggest that the cyclization mechanisms are different for PAN and
PAN/AL blends. The TGA and DSC curves of as-received AL are included
in Figures S4 and S5, respectively, in
the Supporting Information for comparison. AL begins to degrade at
a temperature even lower than 200 °C. There are many oxygen-containing
side groups in AL, which could form radicals or ions caused by thermal
degradation and initiate the cyclization of PAN.

Figure 11 Ozawa plots for the
cyclization reaction for (A) peak 1 and (B)
peak 2 of PAN and PAN/AL blends.

To explain the changes of cyclization activation energy of
PAN
with and without the addition of AL, we propose a two-step reaction
mechanism in Figure 12. For the PAN homopolymer, PAN cyclization is initiated by the radicals,
which are generated during PAN thermal degradation.34,35 Meanwhile, for PAN/AL blends, the degradation of AL occurs at a
much lower temperature and generates AL-based radicals that could
initiate the PAN cyclization. The increment of the cyclization activation
energy does not mean that the cyclization reaction is prohibited by
the addition of AL in PAN but suggests that the radical generation
during the degradation of AL could be easier affected by the environmental
temperature than that of PAN. In this study, it could be found that
the incorporation of AL in PAN reduces the reaction temperature and
facilitates the cyclization of PAN chains.

of PAN/AL during thermal stabilization.

3 Conclusions
In summary, although either
PAN or AL could be well dissolved in
DMSO, their mixture is immiscible, and PAN/AL/DMSO systems exhibit
a sea-island type of phase diagram with individual AL-rich droplets
that uniformly disperse in continuous PAN solutions. Interestingly,
the AL-rich droplets are very stable without an observable increase
of the diameter even after 15 days of storage. Also, a small amount
of AL is found to be dissolved in the PAN continuous phase, which
leads to a lower gelation temperature, a better reversibility of G′ and G″ during heating
cycles, and a higher PAN cyclization activation energy. Because of
the formation of the sea-island structure, a gradient channel structure
is formed for water-coagulated PAN/AL/DMSO systems, and the channel
growth rate of the PAN/AL solution is faster than that of the PAN/DMSO
solution. The decomposition of AL occurs at a lower temperature than
that of PAN, which could generate free radicals and initiate the cyclization
of PAN at a lower temperature. These results would be useful to better
understand how the addition of AL affects the phase diagram, solution
rheology, coagulation behavior, and PAN cyclization and will provide
valuable information on the application of lignin in making carbon
materials.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
and Methods
PAN (homopolymers, Mw ≈ 150 kg/mol, powdery) was purchased
from Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The polymer
was predried under vacuum at 60 °C for 48 h and was kept in a
dryer. AL (powdery), which is mainly composed of hydroxyl groups,
was purchased from TCI Development Co., Ltd. (China). Dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF),
and dimethylacetamide (DMAc, analytical reagent) were purchased from
Aladdin Chemical Co., Ltd. (China). All solvents were predried by
a molecular sieve before use.

In the preparation of PAN/AL solutions,
first, 80, 77.8, and 75 g of DMSO were transferred inside a three-necked,
sealed double-layered round glass bottle after nitrogen purging and
chilled to 23 °C using an isothermal circulation bath. Second,
0, 2.2, and 5 g of AL powder were slowly added into the solvent under
vigorous mechanical stirring. The AL slurry was continually stirred
for 2 h. Third, 20 g of PAN powder was slowly added into AL slurries,
and the mixture was continually stirred for another hour. Next, the
mixtures were slowly heated from 23 to 70 °C at a heating rate
of 1 °C/min and kept isothermally for 2 h and then heated to
80 °C at a heating rate of 1 °C/min and kept isothermally
for 0.5 h. Finally, PAN/AL solutions were cooled to 60 °C at
a cooling rate of 1 °C/min and kept isothermally for 48 h.

In the preparation of AL solutions, 47 g of DMSO, DMF, or DMAc
was transferred inside a glass bottle, and 3 g of AL was slowly added
into each bottle. The AL solutions were kept at 30 °C for 1 h
and then heated to 60 °C and kept isothermally for another 4
h.

In the PAN/AL film preparation, a thin PAN/AL solution layer
was
obtained by a 100 μm scraper on tempered glasses. For the dried
film, the PAN/AL solution layer was dried at 60 °C for 24 h in
an oven. For the coagulated film, the thin PAN/AL solution layer was
immersed in water for 10 days and then heated at 60 °C for 24
h to remove water. The detailed procedure is shown in Figure 13.

preparation process.

4.2 Characterizations
Optical images
were acquired by an optical microscope (OLYMPUS, CX31, Japan). For
optical image collection, a thin layer of silicon oil was applied
on the edge of the cover glass to avoid moisture absorbance. Scanning
electron microscope (SEM) images were collected on a JEOL JSM-7001P
FE-SEM at an electron beam voltage of 5 keV. All samples were gold
sputtered before imaging. The energy-dispersive spectrum (EDS) was
carried out at an electron beam voltage of 15 keV. Thermal analysis
was conducted by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, TA Q2000,
USA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG, METTLER TOLEDO, TGA2, USA).
For DSC measurements, PAN and PAN/AL composite films were heated in
nitrogen (60 mL/min) from 30 to 400 °C at various heating rates
from 2.5 °C/min to 5 °C/min and to 10 °C/min. Fourier
transform infrared spectra (FTIR) were recorded using FTIR spectroscopy
(Bruker VERTEX 80v, USA) for 16 scans at a resolution of 4 cm–1. The rheological behaviors of the PAN and PAN/AL
solutions were conducted on a rotational rheometer (MCR-302, Anton
Paar GmbH, Austria) using a 50.8 mm diameter parallel plate and a
1 mm gap distance. A dynamic strain amplitude of 0.25% was used to
make sure the conducted measurements are in the linear elastic region.
The frequency was changed from 0.05 to 400 rad/s at 30 °C for
frequency sweep, and the dynamic moduli of the solutions were conducted
at a temperature heating/cooling rate of 1 °C/min for temperature
sweep. A layer of silicon oil was applied to the edge of the plates
to prevent solvent evaporation during the measurements. For dynamic
mechanical analysis (DMA, NETZSCH 242-E, German), PAN and PAN/AL composite
films were cut into rectangular strips approximately 12 mm long and
4 mm wide, and dynamic strain frequency was set to be 1 Hz.
