Roughing the metallic
surface via oxidation–reduction
cycles (ORC) to integrate the surface plasmon resonance and surface-enhanced
Raman scattering (SERS) is predominant in developing sensor systems
because of the facile preparation and uniform distribution of nanostructures.
Herein, we proposed a distinctive ORC process: the forward potential
passed through the oxidation of Au and reached the oxygen evolution
reaction, and once the potential briefly remained at the vertex, the
various reverse rates were employed to control the reduction state.
The created hybrid Au–AuOx possessed
electromagnetic and chemical enhancements concurrently, wherein the
rough surface provided the strong local electromagnetic fields and
significant interaction between AuOx and
molecule to improve the charge transfer. The synergistic effects significantly
amplified the intensity of Raman signal with an enhancement factor
of 5.5 × 106 under the optimal conditions. Furthermore,
the prepared SERS substrate can simultaneously identify and quantify
the mixed edible pigments, Brilliant Blue FCF and Indigo Carmine,
individually. This result suggested that the development of SERS sensor
based on the proposed SERS-activated methodology is feasible and reliable.

Introduction
Because the outbreak
of food safety problems is putting the whole people on panic and alert,
increasing attention has been paid to additives in food. To obtain
information on the components, additives, and pathogens in food, numerous
well-developed techniques have been employed, such as liquid chromatography–tandem
mass spectrometry,1,2 gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.3,4 Nevertheless, the complex pretreatment, time-consuming measurement,
and high cost of instruments greatly limit their practical applications.
Especially, the long duration of data collection results in mass accumulation
of pending text samples, thus not getting the information efficiently.
Although electrochemical sensors have been developed to address this
disadvantage, which performs sensitive and real-time detections, selectivity
is a concern because of the severe conditions to the target analytes.5,6

As a consequence, Raman spectroscopy can be advantageously
utilized for developing efficient sensors because Raman spectroscopy
can provide a fingerprint region that is unique to identify the individual
materials and the quantitative analysis of target materials.7 It means that both the identification and quantification
of analytes can be simultaneously performed. However, it is an extreme
challenge to acquire a distinguishable Raman signal when the quantity
of analytes is too low. Toward this end, surface-enhanced Raman scattering
(SERS) has been demonstrated as an effective technique for enhancing
Raman signal intensity by orders of magnitude to identify adsorbates
on the surface. The mechanism of SERS consists of two major components,
namely, the electromagnetic (EM) enhancement (approximately 104–1012), resulting from the enhancement of
local EM fields at the surface of metal that can offer a surface plasma
resonance from electron oscillation (e.g., Ag and Au), and chemical
(CHEM) enhancement (up to 102), associated with a charge
transfer between metal and adsorbate at atomic-scale roughness features.8−10 Thus, the major contribution
to the SERS enhancement can be attributed to the EM mechanism rather
than the CHEM enhancement. Moreover, the distribution of electrochemical
field was non-uniform around the plasmonic nanomaterials but highly
localized in the relatively small radius of curvature, resulting in
hotspots at the sharp edges.11 Additionally,
these hotspots are located within crevices from two closely spaced
plasmonic nanoparticles.10

Recently,
numerous methodologies have been investigated for improving SERS performance.
For instance, Tian et al. prepared a liquid-like
golden droplet through a self-assembly at the chloroform/water interface
as a quantitative liquid-state analyzer.12 Xu et al. prepared end, side, and satellite assemblies from Au nanoparticles
and nanorods through the modification of nanorods with DNA oligomers.13 Besides, numerous materials and patterns were
also designed to improve the SERS performance, including encoded Ag
pyramid,14 highly organized supercrystals
of Au nanorods, deposition of Pt atoms onto Ag nanocubes, and so forth.15,16 However, the prerequisite of most current studies is a high technical
threshold regarding the fabrications of SERS substrates, and consequently,
the practical applications of SERS are comparatively difficult. On
the other hand, directly roughing the metal surface to create hotspot
sites through electrochemical oxidation–reduction cycles (ORC),
which cyclically scans between the potentials of metallic oxidation
and reduction, is a promising manner owing to the advantages of facile
preparation, green chemistry, and uniform surface.17,18 So
far, the roughing process focuses on controlling the size and/or the
shape of metallic nanoparticles for increasing local EM fields. Only
a few studies, however, have been conducted for improving CHEM enhancement
via ORC.

Herein, we propose a novel electrochemical process
to rough the Au surface, which is similar to the conventional ORC,
in which the forward potential reaches the occurrence of oxygen evolution
reaction (OER) and the reverse potential stops at the reduction potential
with various scan rates. By adjusting these parameters in commercial
screen-printed Au electrode (SPE-Au), we can construct a series of
hybrid Au–AuOx substrates. In addition
to increasing EM enhancement contributed from the rough surface, the
unique structure of hybrid Au–AuOx reveals that this hybrid structure can considerably improve the
CHEM enhancement.

Results and Discussion
Surface Morphologies of
Prepared SPE-Au Substrates
To rough the surface of electrode,
the self-electrodepositions
of SPE-Au substrates were performed by fabricating using linear sweep
voltammetry with various forward rates from −0.3 to 1.3 V and
maintaining at the first vertex for 3 s before reversing to −0.3
V, in which the forward scan and the maintained potential at the vertex
produced the dissolved Au ions for subsequent electrodepositions (Figure 1). The roughness
and the condition of reduced Au could be optimized by tuning the reverse
rate, while the dissolving process was also occurring during the reverse
scan once the scan passed through the oxidation region.

Figure 1 Electrochemical
process
of roughing SPE-Au with forward rate of 100 mV/s and the various reverse
rates of 200, 100, 50, 25, and 5 mV/s, while the potential was maintained
at 1.3 V for 3 s. Inset: Photos of the SPE-Au substrates with and
without roughing.

Comparing
with the primary SPE-Au substrate, the treated SPE-Au substrates were
obviously distinguishable from the untreated one by the obvious change
of color (dark brown as illustrated in Figure 1 inset). To reveal the surface change of
SPE-Au substrates induced by the treatment process, the scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images indicated that the surface of primary SPE-Au
substrate was constructed by stacking Au sheets (Figure 2a). Subsequently, only a small
amount of the stacking structure was oxidized to generate Au ions
during the forward process and was redeposited on the surface by rapid
reverse with a scan rate of 200 mV/s (SPE-Au200) (Figure 2b). Especially, the sharp edge
with relatively high surface energy of sheets was deformed into a
blunt condition. This result was in accordance with the observed image
by optical microscopy, in which the structural patterns had no significant
change (Figure S1a,b). Accompanying the
formation of porous nanostructures, most native stacking sheets disappeared
at a reverse rate of 100 mV/s (SPE-Au100) (Figure 2c and Figure S1c). Afterward, the slower reverse with scan rates of 50 to 5 mV/s
(SPE-Au50, SPE-Au25, and SPE-Au5) drove the formation of nanoparticles
followed by a remarkable fusion to form microspheres (Figure 2d–f). Also, these phenomena
correspond to the presented images by optical microscopy, in which
the surface feature turned denser followed by an aggregation to generate
bulk Au that displayed the gold area from SPE-Au5 (Figure S1d–f).

to the various reverse rates: (a) SPE-Au, (b) SPE-Au200, (c) SPE-Au100,
(d) SPE-Au50, (e) SPE-Au25, and (f) SPE-Au5.

Estimation
of Surface Area and Surface Roughness
The surface area corresponding
to the result of SEM was calculated through the measurement of electrochemical
surface area (ECSA) that was represented by an electrochemical double
layer, in which ECSA was obtained from cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves
at various scan rates within a faradaic silent region of 0.25 to 0.3
V (Figure 3a and Figure S2). The slope of SPE-Au200 sample was
0.50 mF; this value was 3.1 times higher than that of bare SPE-Au.
It should be noticed that, nonetheless, the surface of primary SPE-Au
substrate was initially roughed and the surface area could be further
increased because of the formation of porous structure as demonstrated
in Figure 3b. Subsequently,
the surface area increased gently with decreasing reverse rate and
exhibited the highest value at a scan rate of 50 mV/s. However, this
tendency changed once applying a much slower reverse rate, because
the neighboring nanoparticles would fuse into bigger particles as
observed in Figure 2f and Figure S1f. The surface roughness
that was suggested to be positively correlated to its surface area
was evaluated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The three-dimensional
surface of SPE-Au substrate showed a flat surface with a mean roughness
of 0.168 μm (Figure 3c, Figures S3a and S4), whereas
the mean roughness also increased with decreasing reverse rates, which
was consistent with the result of ECSA except for the scan rates of
25 and 5 mV/s (Figure 3c, Figures S3 and S4). Besides, an obvious
separation of two peaks in the histogram of SPE-Au5 substrate revealed
a coexistence of both large and small particles (Figure S4f) and further confirmed the observation in SEM.

Crystallite Size of Prepared
SPE-Au Substrates
The corresponding X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns of the SPE-Au
substrates with/without treatment are depicted in Figure 4. The diffraction peaks at
38.5, 44.7, and 66.7° can be referred to the crystal planes (111),
(200), and (220) of face-centered cubic crystallographic structure
of gold (JCPDS Card No. 65-2870), respectively. The strong diffraction
at 38.5° suggested a preferred growth orientation along the (111)
direction, whereas the diffraction peaks ascribed to the bare ceramic
substrate were present in all obtained results. The peak intensity
of Au evidently declined with decreasing reverse rate and reached
the lowest intensity at a scan rate of 25 mV/s, indicating that the
crystallinity was destroyed during the electrochemical process. Note
that the intensity of peaks reverted to become intense in Au5 sample
because of the formation of bulk Au as illustrated in Figure S1f. Furthermore, the correlation between
the crystallite size and the scan rate of the reverse process was
investigated according to the Scherrer equation; the calculated results
verified that the variations of crystallite size were within 1 nm
and further suggested no strong correlation in between (Figure 4b).

SERS Performance of Probe
Molecule Adsorbed on Prepared SPE-Au
Substrates
The corresponding SERS effects of the prepared
samples were verified by a model probe of Rhodamine 6G (R6G, 10–6 M), wherein the significantly different surface morphologies
would lead to their specific performance. As shown in Figure 5a, the peaks at 609, 771, 1180,
1308/1569, and 1359/1506/1647 cm–1 were attributed
to the C–C–C ring in-plane vibrational mode, C–H
out-of-plane bending mode, C–H in-plane bending mode, N–H
in-plane bending modes, and C–C stretching modes, respectively.26 All peak intensities of 1359 cm–1 were 1496, 2065, 58668, 28283, 33907, and 18821 cps based on SPE-Au,
SPE-Au200, SPE-Au100, SPE-Au50, SPE-Au25, and SPE-Au5 samples, respectively.
Mindfully, the Raman signal of R6G was undetectable on the bare ceramic
substrate until the concentration was raised to 0.1 M; even so, the
intensity was still rather weak (Figure S5). Contrarily, a faint Raman signal was observed from SPE-Au substrate
adsorbing 10–6 M R6G, meaning the edge of stacking
Au sheets on SPE-Au substrate showed a slightly SERS activity. Notably,
this feature could be further enhanced by the electrochemically treated
process developed in the present study. The intensity of Raman signal
increased with a decrease of reverse rate, which could be ascribed
to the enhancement of surface area as well as roughness except for
SPE-Au25 and SPE-Au5 samples. It could be expected that the SPE-Au5
would exhibit a lower performance of SERS than SPE-Au50 and SPE-Au25
substrates because of the presence of both big Au particles and bulk
Au. The enhancement factor (EF) of all substrates based on the peak
intensity at 1359 cm–1 is shown in Figure 5b; the highest EF of 5.5 ×
106 from SPE-Au25 substrate was higher than 3.2 ×
106 from Au@AuAg yolk–shell nanostructures, 5.6
× 104 from gold nanotriangles, 1.0 × 106 from Au/ZnO nanohybrid films, and 0.47 × 105 from
Ag@Au nanodisks.19−22 Moreover, the SERS mapping was performed
with a Raman peak of 1359 cm–1 in a region of 20
× 20 μm2 to evaluate the distribution of the
nanostructure on the substrate. The result showed a relatively uniform
Raman feature over the entire region, indicating the generated SERS-activated
structures were well-distributed regarding the nanostructure (Figure 5c–e).

It was well known that
the SERS efficiency was mainly governed by
the hotspots, which could exhibit a strongly intense EM field, and
the hotspot region with a strong local field enhancement generated
by the surface plasmon resonances commonly occurred within interstitial
crevices of metal nanostructures. In other words, a large surface
area or a highly rough surface could generate more interstitial crevices
and further perform high SERS efficiency. Nevertheless, by comparing
the intensity of Raman signal with both ECSA and mean roughness, the
SPE-Au25 substrate could perform the strongest intensity with the
absence of the largest surface area as well as the highest mean roughness,
indicating that additional effects should be considered as well. Additionally,
the performance of SERS was related to the crystallite size, in which
a larger crystallite size could lead to a higher scattering, thereby
enhancing the SERS efficiency.23,24 Note that the variations
of crystallite sizes in all prepared SERS substrates were less than
1 nm, suggesting that the remarkable enhancements based on SPE-Au50,
SPE-Au25, and SPE-Au5 substrates were not ascribed to the effect of
crystallite size only. All of the abovementioned results reveal the
fact that SERS enhancement in the present study might be attributed
to some unexpected effects, which was generated during the reverse
process in addition to the contribution of interstitial crevice from
particle aggregation. To reveal this unexpected substance that was
generated during the whole electrochemical process, its chemical information
was investigated by Raman spectroscopy due to its rapid and sensitive
nature in comparison with other measuring techniques (Figure 6).25−31 In the condition that reverse rate was higher than forward rate,
it could be clarified that the Au halide, which was produced from
the dissolved Au in a KCl electrolyte, was unable to be completely
reduced. This incomplete Au halide deposition/reduction could be revealed
by observing a characteristic peak at 310 cm–1,
which was assigned to the stretching vibration of Au–Cl (νAu–Cl) on the surface of both SPE-Au200 and SPE-Au100
samples.31 Although the presence of anion
induced the reorientation of adsorbed R6G and increased the junction
site,32,33 the performance of SERS was still much poor
than those of other SERS-active SPE-Au substrates. Most interestingly,
the structure of Au–Cl further disappeared with the generation
of two peaks at 508 and 822 cm–1, which suggested
the formation of new phase from the reduction of Au halide. Because
a previous study affirmed that the νAu–OH lies
at 635 to 677 cm–1, these two peaks can be defined
as the stretching vibrations of AuOx (Au–O)
and hydroperoxy species (Au–OOH), respectively.34,35 This phenomenon is expected because the formation of hydroperoxy
species (M–OOH) that had been recognized as a key intermediate
commonly occurred in both OER and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).34,36 In contrast to the conventional ORC, in which the oxidation process
was carried out until the oxidation potential of Au, the forward process
passed through the oxidation potential of Au as well as the potential
of OER in this study. Notably, for OER, the formation of Au–O
and Au–OOH would not occur at the forward scan with a rapid
scan rate of 100 mV/s for oxidizing Au and a short duration of 3 s
at the vertex. Consequently, the formation of Au–O and Au–OOH
was dominated in the reverse scan.
The reverse process involved the OER, ORR, and Au reduction. The rapid
reverse process with a scan rate above 100 mV/s was unable to form
AuOx and Au–OOH, whereas the case
of below 50 mV/s could offer sufficient time to complete the formation
in both OER and ORR. Nevertheless, the reduction of Au–OOH
also occurred at the slowest scan rate of 5 mV/s, resulting in the
disappearance of Au–OOH feature in the Raman spectrum. By comparing
the correlation between the intensity of R6G signal and the feature
of SERS substrate in the Raman spectra, the relatively lower intensity
in the presence of Au–Cl might be attributed to a lower roughness
surface. Furthermore, the intensity failed to vary significantly with
and without Au–OOH once the scan rate was conducted between
50 and 5 mV/s; this observation could reveal that the enhancement
species in the Raman signal was Au–O. It has been demonstrated
that the mechanism of SERS consists of two abovementioned components
(i.e., EM and CHEM enhancements); the EM enhancement was attributed
to the enhancement of local EM field on the metal surface, which possessed
the surface plasma resonance, and the CHEM enhancement was referred
to the specific interaction between metal surface and molecule involved
in the variation of charge transfer. On the basis of the results of
Raman spectra (Figure 6), it could evidently indicate that the EF of Raman spectroscopy
contributed to the synergistic effect of both EM and CHEM enhancements.
The CHEM enhancement was attributed to the formation of interaction
between AuOx and molecule, resulting in
a charge transfer from Au to molecule.37 Thus, the SPE-Au25 exhibited the superior SERS performance of EF
compared to the literature.19−22 The SPE-Au25 sample possessed
a higher performance of SERS than SPE-Au50 because of a stronger peak
intensity of AuOx, which corresponds to
the amount of produced AuOx on the surface.
Additionally, the lowest SERS performance of SPE-Au5 sample among
SPE-Au50, SPE-Au25, and SPE-Au5 substrates could be caused by the
formation of bulk Au. Furthermore, to assess the reproducibility of
SPE-Au25 substrate which exhibited the SERS performance through the
contributions of the conformation and the component of nanostructures.
Meanwhile, the commercial SPE-Au substrate and the fixed electrochemical
parameters provided the stable process for reproducibly constructing
geometric surfaces (Figure S6). Also, Raman
spectra indicated that the SERS-active AuOx species could be created in three different batches (Figure S7). By examining 10–6 M R6G through the three SPE-Au25 substrates, the peak intensities
at 1359 cm–1 were 35794, 33126, and 34970 with an
RSD of 4.6%, demonstrating that the SPE-Au substrate with the SERS-active
Au–AuOx was reproducible (Figure S8).

SERS substrates.

Application
of SPE-Au25 Substrate in the Detection of Pigments
To achieve
brightly colored food that can reflect its delicacy and commonly cause
appetite, food additives are used to improve the appearance of articles,
such as beverages and processed food products. However, these additives,
which include some pigments, are harmful to health even if they are
edible. For instance, Brilliant Blue FCF (BBF) is recognized as a
nontoxic blue additive, which is widely used in soft drinks and ice
cream. BBF has been revealed to inhibit intimal hyperplasia during
vein graft preparation and suppress amyloid fibrillogenesis of lysozyme.38,39 Recent studies, nevertheless, also demonstrated that BBF was genotoxic
and cytotoxic.40,41 With the aim of proving the concept
of this study, Figure 7a displays the SERS spectra onto the SPE-Au25 substrate with a concentration
of BBF from 10–8 to 10–3 M. The
main peaks at 910, 1177, 1224, and 1621 cm–1 were
defined as in-plane C–H swing on the benzene ring, C–C/C–H
nonsurface swing, C–N asymmetric telescope, and C–N
nonplane swing, respectively.42 This SERS
sensor in the detection of BBF manifested a linear range of 10–8 to 10–3 M with an RSD of 3.6–8.8%
based on the calculated intensity at 1621 cm–1 (Figure 7b). Basically, the
lowest detection concentration (10–8 M) of the obtained
calibration curve toward BBF was sufficient for quantifying the BBF
level in practical applications because BBF would lose its coloring
function, becoming nearly colorless, once the concentration was lower
than 10–6 M. Also, the repeatability was performed
by measuring BBF after removing and reinjecting the BBF solution of
10–6 M into a cell; meanwhile, the position of measured
spot was fixed. The obtained mean intensity at 1621 cm–1 was 3914.0 with an RSD value of 3.9%, meaning the SPE-Au25 substrate
was repeatable (Figure S9). The stability
of SPE-Au25 substrate in ambient conditions was evaluated by measuring
a BBF solution of 10–6 M (Figure S10). It could be observed that the fluctuation of peak intensity
at 1621 cm–1 remained steady obviously with an RSD
of 4.7% on the 10th day. Furthermore, the characteristic peaks of
produced SERS-active Au–AuOx was
still present in the Raman spectrum (Figure S11), demonstrating that the active site was not destroyed. These two
phenomena revealed the SPE-Au25 substrate was highly stable. Additionally,
another blue pigment, Indigo Carmine (IC), was also examined by SPE-Au25
substrate, and the result is shown in Figure 7c. Similarly, some characteristic peaks in
Raman spectra were revealed to be in-plane C—H/C=O bending
at 1244 cm–1, νC–N at 1296
cm–1, in-plane C–H/N–H bending at
1352 cm–1, asymmetrical νC=C at 1582 cm–1, and νC=O of pyrrolidone ring at 1631 and 1703 cm–1.43 The peak intensity at 1582 cm–1 could exhibit a linear correlation with the concentration of IC,
with a range of 10–7 to 10–3 M
and RSD values of 5.6–8.9% (Figure 7d). Notably, once the BBF and IC were mixed
together, their corresponding features were distinguishable through
the SERS spectrum (Figure 8). This result is extremely important in the development of
a reliable and an accurate sensor because an analyte can be identified
even if it exists in real samples. The individual concentrations of
BBF and IC in the mixture were calculated by applying their corresponding
linear equations regarding the intensities at 1621 cm–1 for BBF and at 1582 cm–1 for IC, in which a variation
of 6.7% that was caused by the band overlapping was revealed. As a
consequence, the above results indicate that the system developed
in this study was feasible to simultaneously characterize the food
additive and quantify its amount.

Conclusions
In summary, the hybrid Au–AuOx produced on the SPE-Au substrata via a novel
ORC process significantly improved SERS performance with the presence
of the synergistic effects of EM and CHEM enhancements. Both the preparation
of SERS substrate and the detection of pigment were carried out in
the electrochemistry–Raman spectroscopy combined system. It
is worth noting that this procedure exhibited the advantages of low
technical threshold, simple preparation, environmentally friendly
process, low cost, and reliable detection, indicating that it has
high potential for the mass manufacture of SERS substrates. Furthermore,
the SERS enhancement through the metal–metallic oxide interaction
might provide a new strategy for catalyst design in electrocatalytic
reaction.
