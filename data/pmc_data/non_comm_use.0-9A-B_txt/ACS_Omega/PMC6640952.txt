An
efficient and a selective charge extraction from a new type
of heterostructured material is demonstrated: the quasi-type-II structure
formed upon deposition of ZnSe quantum dots on CdSe nanoplatelets,
termed as CdSe/ZnSe dots-on-plates (DoPs) heterostructures. Insights
into the charge extraction mechanism are gained from the present studies.
Quenching experiments on nanoplatelets (NPLs) and DoPs using electron
(benzoquinone) and hole (pyridine) quenchers show the possibility
of electron extraction leaving behind the hole in the nanostructures.
These outcomes indicate more labile electron extraction in comparison
with the hole from these DoP structures vis-à-vis the plate
only nanostructures, thereby enabling materials for devices requiring
only one type of charges. In CdSe NPLs, the excitons are short-lived
making them difficult for various applications involving charge separation.
The CdSe/ZnSe DoPs could be alternate candidates for overcoming the
difficulties involved with NPLs.

Introduction
Over the last few decades,
there has been tremendous interest in
the synthesis of colloidal semiconductor nanomaterials (NMs) and their
applications in various areas, such as photovoltaics, light emitting
diodes, biological imaging and sensors, transistors, and lasers.1−9 The unique features of these NMs are due to the quantum confinement
effect, which results into size-dependent optoelectronic properties.
Initially, research was more focussed on the optimized syntheses of
various sizes of these colloidal nanocrystals (NCs), followed by the
development of different synthetic strategies to synthesize NMs of
varied shapes and compositions as well. To date, various shapes of
the semiconductor NMs, including spherical quantum dots (QDs), nanorods,
tetrapods, and nanoplatelets (NPLs)10−12 have been synthesized
successfully. The QDs, nanorods, and NPLs exhibit confinement of excitons
in three, two, and one dimensions, respectively. Out of the NMs mentioned
above, the most recent addition to the family are the colloidal two-dimensional
(2D) materials, that is, NPLs, nanoribbons, nanosheets, quantum belts,
or quantum disks.13−16 Two-dimensional nanostructures of cadmium chalcogenides (CdE, E
= S, Se, and Te) have been synthesized with control of their thickness
with atomic precision. These show sharp absorption and emission peaks
with very small Stokes shifts and short radiative fluorescence lifetimes.
The optical properties of these NPLs vary strongly with their thickness.
Because the thickness, which is in the order of a few monolayers (MLs)
of the material, is typically less than the bulk exciton Bohr radius,
effects of quantum confinement can be exploited to tune the optical
absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra.17 Two-dimensional NPLs have precise quantum confinement throughout
the sheet along the thickness and not in all directions as in the
0D nanoparticles. Because of their unidirectional confinement and
large lateral extension, 2D NPLs are perfect candidates for charge
transport owing to reduction in the number of hopping steps as a result
of a high ratio of their lateral size over their confined direction.18−20 These properties make 2D NPLs promising candidates for light harvesting
and charge transport materials in photovoltaics.21,22

An additional epitaxial growth of a semiconductor layer in
the
vicinity of the starting semiconductor material and decoration of
another semiconductor or metal on their surface leads to various architectures
of heterostructures. By doing so, the properties can be altered precisely
by controlling the spatial delocalization of the charge carriers across
the heterostructures. They may carry properties exhibited by each
semiconductor component as well as new properties generated as a result
of their combination. These colloidal nanoheterostructures are possibly
the best candidates for excitonic engineering and present fascinating
opportunities for enhanced platforms of colloidal photonics.2,23−30 On the basis of the relative alignment of the conduction band (CB)
and valence band (VB) edges of the two materials, these NMs can be
differentiated as type-I or type-II. In type-I structures, the electron
and hole reside in the same material of the structure leading to maximum
overlap of electron and hole wave functions. In type-II structures,
the lowest CB and highest VB edges of the two components lie in different
semiconductors. Therefore, the electrons and holes localize in different
parts of the heterostructure resulting in charge separation. In the
case of cadmium chalcogenide NPLs, another semiconductor material
can be grown epitaxially as well as laterally. The NPL–semiconductor
heterostructures that result from the epitaxial growth of another
material are termed as core/shell nanoplatelets, whereas they are
called core/crown nanoplatelets when the semiconductor material is
grown laterally. The first report on core/shell NPLs involved the
synthesis of CdSe/CdS and CdSe/CdZnS, in which they were shown to
exhibit red-shifted absorption and emission properties compared to
those of the core NPLs.31 From then on,
these systems have been studied extensively by various groups.18,32−35 For synthesis of core/shell NPLs, besides one pot synthesis, the
colloidal atomic layer deposition technique has also been employed
and multiple quantum wells have been synthesized successfully.31 Also, several varieties of core/crown heterostructures,
such as type-I CdSe/CdS and CdS/CdSe and type-II CdSe/CdTe and CdTe/CdSe,
have been synthesized and studied recently.36−41 In core/crown structures, the crown layer grows only in lateral
directions and this does not result into any noticeable change in
the emission spectrum with respect to that of core NPLs because the
confinement in the vertical thickness, which dictates the electronic
structure, does not change.

To the best of our knowledge, we
have not come across a single
report that employs ZnSe for purposes of charge separation in CdSe
NPLs although other semiconductors18,32,38 and metals42 have been
used. Here, we report the synthesis and characterizations of CdSe/ZnSe
dots-on-plate (DoP) NPLs having a quasi-type-II structure. For this
purpose, initially we have synthesized 4 and 5 ML CdSe NPLs, which
are used further as seeds for the growth of ZnSe over these NPLs to
result into CdSe/ZnSe DoPs. We have carried out structural and optical
studies of these DoPs. The PL measurements show an emission feature
at low energy in the red region, quite different from that of core
NPLs, which exhibit green emission. Time resolved photoluminescence
(TRPL) studies have also been done to understand their decay behavior,
which results into a longer average lifetime for CdSe/ZnSe DoPs in
comparison to that of the core CdSe-only NPLs. The NPLs possess zinc
blende (ZB) crystal structure, and this is preserved even after the
coating of ZnSe, confirmed from the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
patterns. The spatial separation of electrons and holes across the
CdSe/ZnSe heterojunction effectively suppresses recombination processes,
leading to a long-lived charge transfer exciton state. If it is possible
to suppress recombination, it might well be possible to extract the
charges from the excited state. Following this hint, we performed
quenching experiments of charge carriers with electron and hole quenchers,
namely benzoquinone (BQ) and pyridine (Py). It was realized that although
the electron can be extracted easily from the charge-separated state
and can be utilized, the hole prefers to remain stuck in the NMs,
most likely in the traps. This is also supported by photocatalytic
dye degradation studies (see Supporting Information (SI)).

Results and Discussion
In this study, we have synthesized
4 and 5 ML thick CdSe/ZnSe DoP
heterostructures. Figure 1A depicts the formation of DoPs from core CdSe NPLs in the
presence of zinc and selenium precursors. On the basis of the band
alignment, as illustrated in Figure 1B, the CdSe/ZnSe forms a quasi-type-II system where
CdSe is a narrow band gap semiconductor whose CB lies much below that
of ZnSe, whereas the VB lies very close to that of ZnSe. The electrons
are strongly localized in CdSe due to a large CB offset. However,
the holes are delocalized in the CdSe/ZnSe system owing to the very
small VB offset, making it a quasi-type-II structure.

NPL to CdSe/ZnSe DoP and (B) Quasi-type-II
band alignment in the CdSe/ZnSe core/shell system.

We employed seed-mediated growth to synthesize
the CdSe/ZnSe DoP
heterostructures. For this purpose, at first, CdSe NPLs of 4 and 5
ML thickness were synthesized with the procedure described in the Experimental Section. The assignment of the number
of MLs has been extensively worked out and detailed in the literature.13 The absorption and PL spectra of 4 and 5 ML
thick CdSe NPLs are given in Figure 2a,d, respectively. The first two absorption maxima
correspond to the heavy-hole electron (HHE) and light-hole electron
(LHE) transitions.13 In Figure 2a, 4 ML CdSe NPLs exhibit absorption
transitions due to HHE and LHE at 512 nm (2.42 eV) and 481 nm (2.58
eV), respectively. These show a very sharp and narrow emission at
515 nm (2.40 eV), with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 8 nm
(38 meV), and the narrow emission from these CdSe NPLs is due to their
pure one-dimensional confinement. CdSe NPLs (5 ML) have a sharp emission
peak at 554 nm (2.24 eV), with a FWHM of 9 nm (36 meV); HHE and LHE
absorption transitions occur at 551 nm (2.25 eV) and 520 nm (2.38
eV), respectively, as shown in Figure 2d. These CdSe NPLs have been used as seeds for further
decoration with ZnSe dots. The procedures are outlined in the Experimental details.

emission when illuminated with UV light. Time-resolved decay traces

The absorption and PL spectra
of the synthesized 4 and 5 ML CdSe/ZnSe
DoP heterostructures are given in Figure 2b,e, respectively. In Figure 2b, we see that some of the excitonic features
of 4 ML CdSe NPLs are still preserved after the growth of ZnSe dots
around the NPLs but are not as sharp as they were in the pristine
case; they are slightly broadened. Also, an additional excitonic feature
appears at a lower energy after incorporation of the ZnSe dots. The
increased absorption at high energy is due to the ZnSe coating as
it absorbs in the region below 450 nm that corresponds to its bulk
band gap of 2.7 eV. It suggests that the NPL structure is still intact
and coating with ZnSe is not affecting the original structure but
providing additional structural and optical characteristics. The PL
spectrum shows the emission maximum shifted to a lower energy of 2.06
eV (600 nm) compared to that in the bare NPL emission at 2.41 eV (515
nm). In 5 ML thick CdSe/ZnSe NPLs, similar features are observed,
as shown in Figure 2e. The PL spectrum shows the emission at 2.02 eV (612 nm) red-shifted
from the bare CdSe NPLs that emit at 2.24 eV (554 nm). The FWHM of
the PL peak from DoPs is larger than that of the PL peak from bare
NPLs: 113 meV versus 37 meV for 4 MLs and 109 meV versus 36 meV for
5 MLs. Also, the absence of the NPL emission peaks suggests almost
complete DoP formation; bare CdSe NPLs would have shown the respective
emissions.

The PL decay curves for CdSe NPLs and CdSe/ZnSe DoP
heterostructures
are shown in Figure 2c,f. Both 4 and 5 ML CdSe NPLs show faster decays with short average
lifetimes, whereas the growth of ZnSe dots around these NPLs results
in a slow recombination of charge carriers, with longer average lifetimes.
The PL decay curves are fitted by a three-exponential decay function,
suggesting multiple decay channels. The fitted parameters such as
lifetimes, coefficient of each lifetime, and average lifetimes, are
presented in Table 1. The average lifetime of emission from DoP heterostructures is enhanced
4-fold in comparison to bare CdSe NPLs. It has been suggested that
CdSe NPLs involve complex decay kinetics that is hard to interpret.
However, different lifetime components can be attributed to the radiative
and nonradiative channels, which can be associated with electron or/and
hole trapping.43

and 5 ML) and of Corresponding CdSe/ZnSe DoPs

We discuss the effects of
the lifetime changes below. Before that
is discussed, to confirm the formation of NPLs and DoPs, structural
characterization is necessary. In Figure 3, PXRD patterns of 4 and 5 ML NPLs and DoPs
are presented. The patterns for bulk CdSe in ZB and wurtzite (WZ)
phases and ZnSe in ZB phase are also provided. The CdSe NPLs possess
ZB crystal structures, as seen from the comparison with the bulk diffraction
patterns. All of the reflection peaks can be indexed with the ZB crystal
structure of CdSe and the absence of any peak at 35 and 45.7°
that would correspond to the (102) and (103) reflections, respectively,
rules out the possibility of a WZ structure. It is observed that the
crystal structure of NPLs is preserved after decoration with ZnSe
except that a little shift of the peaks toward the higher angle is
noticed, indicating the smaller size of the ZnSe lattice that grows
on the CdSe NPLs. It is reported that the NPLs have their thickness
in the 100 direction.44 The TEM images
of CdSe NPLs are shown in Figure 3b,f. The average dimensions of 4 ML NPLs are 17 ±
2 nm of length and 8 ± 2 nm of width, whereas for the 5 ML NPLs
these are 20 ± 2 and 10 ± 2 nm. When the CdSe NPLs are coated
with ZnSe, the resulting structures are shown in Figure 3c,g. It is seen that some dark
patches are present around the NPLs, and these are of ZnSe, which
is also confirmed by EDX, shown in the SI. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images
in Figure 3d,h for
4 ML CdSe/ZnSe DoPs show that the dark patches at the NPL edges correspond
to the ZnSe dots as the d-spacing of 3.2 Å matches
very well with the ZB ZnSe (111) plane. Now that these nanostructures
are well-characterized, we come back to the fact that the lifetime
increases over 3-fold upon decoration with ZnSe dots that we discussed
above. This prompted us to see whether it is possible to extract the
charges from these DoPs and whether it is easier compared to that
from NPLs.

and 5 ML thick CdSe/ZnSe, CdSe NPL, alongwith bulk CdSe WZ, CdSe ZB,

DoPs can be seen in (d) and (h).

Electron–Hole Quenching Studies
To gain an insight
into the charge carrier dynamics, we performed experiments involving
quenching of charge carriers. These are established techniques45,46 that have been reported earlier using BQ as an electron acceptor
and Py as a hole acceptor to understand the accessibility of charge
carriers (electron or hole). The ease of accessibility of the charge
carriers also throws light on the trap states present in the materials.
Charges associated with deep traps should be difficult to extract.19,47

Figure 4a presents
the PL data of 4 ML CdSe NPLs in the absence and presence of a quencher.
From these, it is clearly observed that the PL intensity is almost
completely quenched after the addition of BQ, whereas there is a very
small decrease in the PL intensity in the presence of Py. Knowing
that BQ is an electron quencher and Py, a hole quencher, the data
suggests that electron extraction from CdSe NPLs is easier compared
with extraction of holes. The lifetime decay (Figure 4b) becomes faster in the presence of BQ,
whereas there is hardly any change in the presence of Py. Similar
trends, which are seen in Figure 4c,d, are observed with the CdSe/ZnSe DoP nanostructure
having quasi-type-II band alignment. The presence of ZnSe providing
the additional delocalization of hole over the entire structure results
in a slower recombination of charge carriers. One must keep in mind
that the CdSe surface is also accessible to the quencher as ZnSe just
decorates the edges and does not encapsulate the entire CdSe surface.
It is thus seen that the electrons are accessible but the holes are
difficult to extract from these nanostructures. This is shown schematically
in Figure 5. Further,
in future, ultrafast time-resolved measurements of the excited state
will enable to pin down the states responsible for trapping the holes.

state and (b) time-resolved PL spectra of 4 ML CdSe
NPLs without any quenchers, with BQ and Py. (c, d) Similar data for
4 ML CdSe/ZnSe DoP.

of the quenching experiment in CdSe NPL
and CdSe/ZnSe DoP in the presence of a hole and electron quencher,
using Py and BQ, respectively.

Following from the above results, we have carried out the
photocatalytic
dye degradation experiments taking methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine
B (RhB) as model compounds. The CdSe/ZnSe DoPs exhibit a higher catalytic
activity in comparison to that of the CdSe NPLs. Also, these nanostructures
selectively degrade MB and not RhB. The data and discussion have been
presented in SI.

Conclusions
We report a new system, CdSe/ZnSe DoPs, exhibiting a quasi-type-II
structure, based on CdSe NPLs. The DoPs have been well characterized
for optical and structural aspects. Nearly all of the NPLs get converted
into DoPs, as evident from the disappearance of the NPL emission in
these samples. The ease of electron extraction from these nanostructures
is demonstrated, whereas the hole remains stuck within the trap states.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
Cadmium acetate dihydrate (Cd(OAc)2·2H2O, 98%, Fisher Scientific), zinc acetate dihydrate
(Zn(OAc)2·2H2O, 98.5%, Qualigens), trioctylphosphine
(TOP, 90%, Sigma-Aldrich), 1-octadecene (ODE, 90%, Sigma-Aldrich),
oleic acid (OA, 90%, Sigma-Aldrich), selenium powder (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich),
cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate, myristic acid (99.5%, Spectrochem),
sodium hydroxide (Fischer Scientific), MB (Qualigens), and RhB (Sigma-Aldrich)
were used as received. All of the solvents were dried and were purchased
from Merck Chemicals.

Preparation of Cadmium Myristate
Cadmium myristate
(Cd(Myr)2) was prepared by following a recipe given in
the literature.39 Cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate
(1.542 g, 5 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous methanol (50 mL). A sodium
myristate solution was prepared by dissolving sodium hydroxide (0.600
g, 15 mmol) and myristic acid (3.420 g, 15 mmol) in anhydrous methanol
(500 mL). Then, the cadmium nitrate solution was added dropwise into
the sodium myristate solution, with vigorous stirring. After the addition
of all of the cadmium nitrate solution, the reaction was continued
for 30 min until completion of the reaction. The resulting white precipitate
was washed with methanol three times to remove unreacted precursors
and then dried at 65 °C under vacuum overnight.

Preparation
of 4 ML Thick CdSe NPLs
CdSe NPLs (4 ML)
were synthesized following a method from the literature.48 In a 50 mL four-neck flask, 170 mg (0.3 mmol)
Cd(Myr)2 and 12 mg (0.15 mmol) Se powder were mixed in
15 mL of ODE. The reaction mixture was degassed under vacuum at room
temperature for 30 min, and then, under an argon flow, the temperature
was set at 240 °C. When the temperature reached 195 °C,
40 mg (0.15 mmol) Cd(OAc)2 was swiftly introduced into
the flask. When the temperature reached 240 °C, the reaction
was continued for 10 min, then quenched by the addition of 1 mL of
OA, and the mixture was rapidly cooled to room temperature. Thus,
the obtained product contained a mixture of CdSe QDs and CdSe nanoplatelets.
At first, hexane was added to the product and centrifuged at 5000
rpm for 5 min. The supernatant containing QDs was discarded and the
pellet being settled at the bottom of the centrifuge tube was dispersed
in hexane. The NPLs were purified by size-selective precipitation
upon addition of ethanol followed by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for
5 min. After
centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate
having CdSe NPLs was re-dispersed in hexane. This final product is
used for coating of ZnSe on its surface.

Preparation of 5 ML Thick
CdSe NPLs
5 ML CdSe NPLs
were synthesized following a recipe from the literature.48 In a 50 mL four-necked flask, 170 mg (0.3 mmol)
of Cd(Myr)2 in 15 mL of ODE was mixed. The mixture was
degassed under vacuum at room temperature for 30 min, and then, under
an argon flow, the temperature was set at 240 °C. When the temperature
reached 240 °C, 1 mL solution of Se sonicated in ODE (0.15 M)
was quickly injected and after 10 s, 80 mg (0.30 mmol) of Cd(OAc)2 was introduced into the flask. The reaction was continued
for 10 min then quenched by the addition of 1 mL of OA, and the mixture
was rapidly cooled to room temperature. The NPLs were purified by
the same procedure as described above for purification of 4 ML CdSe
NPLs. The final product was redispersed in hexane and used as for
coating of zinc selenide on its surface.

Preparation of CdSe/ZnSe
DoPs
CdSe NPLs dissolved in
5 mL of ODE, 238 μL (0.75 mmol) OA, and 109.7 mg (0.5 mmol)
zinc acetate were introduced in a 25 mL, four-necked round bottom
flask and degassed under vacuum for 30 min at room temperature. Then,
the reaction mixture was heated to 235 °C under Ar flow. When
a reaction temperature of 235 °C was attained, 50 μL of
1 M TOPSe (0.05 mmol Se) in 1 mL of ODE was swiftly injected into
the reaction mixture. After 15 min, the reaction was quenched by adding
0.5 mL of OA and was cooled to room temperature in water bath. The
product is dispersed in hexane and purified with ethanol followed
by centrifuging twice and finally dispersed in hexane for further
characterizations.

Characterization
The CdSe NPLs and
CdSe/ZnSe DoPs were
dispersed in hexane and used for further characterizations. The absorption
spectra of these samples were collected on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 1050
UV/vis/NIR spectrophotometer in a quartz cuvette. The PL emission
spectra of the same solution were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer LS-55
spectrophotometer, with the excitation and emission slit widths fixed
at 5 nm each, at an excitation wavelength of 377 nm. The lifetime
decay curves were recorded at the PL peak maximum for each sample
using time-correlated single photon counting on Edinburgh Instruments
FLSP920. A pulsed laser diode (377 nm) with a pulse repetition rate
of 500 kHz was employed for the lifetime measurements. The instrument
response function was determined using a Ludox scattering solution
in water. All of the decay curves were fitted multiexponentially using
the equation, I(t) = ∑iαi e–t/τi, where I(t) is the total intensity
remaining at time t. αi and τi are the amplitude
and decay time of ith component, respectively. The
average lifetime of the sample is measured using the equation τav = ∑in(αiτi2/αiτi). The PXRD data were collected on a Bruker D8 Advance Diffractometer
equipped with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation. For PXRD, the sample
was prepared by evaporation of the solvent from concentrated dispersions
directly onto the glass sample holder. TEM images and EDAX were taken
on a JEOL-JEM 2010 electron microscopy using 200 kV electron source.
Samples were prepared on 200-mesh carbon-coated Cu grids by dropping
the solution of NCs dispersed in hexane.

PL Quenching of Nanostructures
CdSe NPLs and CdSe/ZnSe
DoPs were dispersed in dried chloroform. The steady state and time-resolved
PL measurements were carried out with and without quencher. Here,
equimolar para-BQ and Py were introduced as electron and hole quenchers,
respectively.49,50
