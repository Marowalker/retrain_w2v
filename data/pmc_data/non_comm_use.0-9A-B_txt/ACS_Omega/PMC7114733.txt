It is highly desirable
to design high-efficiency stable and low-price
catalysts in the electrocatalysis field. Herein, we reported a cobalt
phosphide (Co2P)-loaded reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composite
catalyst (rGO/Co2P) prepared via the convenient hydrothermal
and H2 reduction methods. The rGO/Co2P catalyst
reduced at 800 °C (rGO/Co2P-800) shows superior electrocatalytic
activities for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction
in 1.0 M KOH solution, achieving an overpotential of 134 and 378 mV,
respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm–2. Moreover, the catalyst can not only maintain stability for a long
time in alkaline solution but also in acid media because of the protection
of the rGO layers. The superior performance of this catalyst is attributed
to the synergy between the carbon layer and transition-metal phosphides.
The Co2P nanoparticles have a high degree of dispersion,
which prevents agglomeration, thereby exposing more active sites.
Moreover, rGO protects the exposed metal particles while providing
more electroconductivity to the material. This work provides an efficient
route for the development of bifunctional electrocatalysts with excellent
performance and stability, which provides new ideas toward overall
water splitting.

1 Introduction
With the depletion of global traditional energy sources and increase
of environmental pollution, the urgent demand for clean and renewable
energy sources is increasing.1,2 Hydrogen, as a renewable
substitute to fossil fuels, has attracted widespread attention because
of its great reserves and more environmentally friendly behavior.3,4 At present, among all hydrogen production methods, electrocatalytic
water-splitting process is the most sustainable, effective, and environmentally
friendly method. The theoretical voltage of water splitting is 1.23
V, and it is often below the required impressed voltage. This is caused
by the sluggish dynamics of the anode and cathode.5 It is well known that noble metals work very well for hydrogen
evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER).6,7 Nevertheless, because they are relatively rare and expensive, their
mass production and practical application are greatly limited.8 In addition, the use of diverse catalysts for
the water-splitting reaction of the anode and cathode greatly increases
operating procedures and production costs. Hence, there is an urgent
need to design high-efficiency and cheap bifunctional catalysts for
HER and OER simultaneously.9−11

At present, researchers
are actively involved in the preparation
of various transition-metal materials (such as Co-,12,13 Mo-,14,15 Ni-16 based catalysts,
etc.) and derivatives such as composites (e.g., −C,17−19 −N,20,21 −S, etc.) as HER and/or
OER catalysts. Among these, metal oxides, hydroxides, and other metal
compounds are used in OER.22,23 Metal phosphides, carbides,
nitrides, and phosphates are used in HER.24,25 So far, cobalt-based catalysts,26 especially
cobalt phosphide catalysts,27,28 have received wide
attention because of their low-price advantage over noble metals.
However, satisfactory results are difficult to be achieved with their
catalytic activity and durability , and they are highly susceptible
to corrosion in acidic media.29 Researchers
are also widely concerned with carbon-based materials because of their
high specific area, excellent conductivity, and good stability.30−32 The metal phosphide is embedded in the carbon material carrier,
which can effectively prevent the loss of the metal.33 The strong adsorption capacity of the carbon material can
prevent dissolved Co from falling into the electrolyte to a certain
extent and plays a role in stabilizing Co. Among the carbon-based
materials, the graphene-based material is an effective material for
electrochemical energy storage and conversion.34−36 Moreover, the
composites of carbon-based materials and transition metals will produce
a synergistic effect and enhance the catalytic activity of the catalyst.37 Therefore, we propose a strategy to embed spherical
Co2P nanoparticles into reduced graphene oxide (rGO) layers,
which can well prevent the spherical Co2P nanoparticles
from being corroded by the acidic electrolyte. The cobalt phosphide
nanoparticles can be loaded on carbon layers to overcome these disadvantages.
In addition, because of its unique delocalized conjugated electron
system, graphene can strongly conjugate with a specific structure
of the catalyst, thereby enhancing the activity of the catalyst.38 Therefore, using graphene as a carrier supporting
a cobalt-based phosphide thereon can improve the catalytic activity.
It facilitates the exposure of more active sites, enhances charge
transfer, and improves cycle tolerance.39

The concentration of hydroxides and protons constantly changes
because of water splitting. Further, compared to the high corrosion
resistance of the catalyst in an alkaline electrolyte, acidic water
electrolysis is of less advantage. Most catalysts can only perform
well in either alkaline or acidic solution.40 Thus, it is necessary to prepare a high-efficiency, durable bifunctional
catalyst that exhibits good performance over a broad range of pH.41,42 At the same time, the design of the electrolytic cell can be simplified
and the production cost can be reduced.43

In this work, we report the bifunctional electrocatalyst rGO/Co2P via the simple hydrothermal method and H2 reduction
method. Because of the synergy of each component, the as-prepared
materials show superior performances and stability not only in alkaline
medium but also in acidic media. On the one hand, rGO can increase
the electroconductibility and improve the dispersion of Co2P particles. On the other hand, Co2P nanoparticles can
increase the electrocatalytic activity of carbon. This provides a
low overpotential and high stability for HER and OER. The proposed
rGO/Co2P is a highly active and low-cost bifunctional catalyst,
which provides an exciting route for overall water splitting.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Synthesis of GO
We adopt the modified
Hummer method to synthesize graphene oxide (GO).44 Graphite powder (C) (2.0 g) and sodium nitrate (NaNO3) (1.0 g) were transferred into a dry three-neck round-bottom
flask (500 mL), and then concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) (46 mL) was added. The above mixture was mixed intensely
in an ice–water bath for 30 min. Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) (6.0 g) was slowly injected into the system, stirring at
20 °C for 1 h; then the ice bath was removed, stirred at 35 °C
overnight, and deionized water (92 mL) was added under magnetic stirring.
The solution immediately turned brown. After vigorous stirring, hydrogen
peroxide (30 wt %, 20 mL) was added dropwise for 1 h. The mixture
was then washed until pure. The finally obtained filter cake is naturally
dried to obtain the desired product.

2.2 Synthesis
of GO/Co3(PO4)2 Samples
For the preparation of GO/Co3(PO4)2, 0.029 g of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate
(Co(NO3)2·6H2O), 0.10 g of sodium
dodecyl sulfate, and 1.20 g of urea were ultrasonically dispersed
in 10 mL of deionized water. Graphene powder (0.0050 g) was dispersed
in 10 mL of deionized water and poured into the above mixed solution
at room temperature. A 41 μL of phosphoric acid (H3PO4) was instilled to the mixture and stirred for 1 h
until uniform dispersion. The solution was filled in a 20 mL polytetrafluoroethylene
liner and transferred to an autoclave and then maintained at 80 °C
for 12 h. The hydrothermal product was obtained by centrifugal washing
with ethanol for three times and with deionized water once. After
complete drying, GO/Co3(PO4)2 was
obtained.

2.3 Synthesis of rGO/Co2P Catalysts
The rGO/Co2P catalyst is synthesized by high-temperature
reduction. By tube furnace roasting reduction, the GO/Co3(PO4)2 precursors were reduced at 600, 700,
800, and 900 °C for 2 h under N2/H2, respectively.
By adjusting the temperature of the tube furnace, rGO/Co2P-600, rGO/Co2P-700, rGO/Co2P-800, and rGO/Co2P-900 catalysts are obtained without changing the other experimental
conditions.

In the above steps, the comparative sample of Co2P is obtained without adding GO at a reduction temperature
of 800 °C.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Preparation and Characterization of rGO/Co2P
GO/Co3(PO4)2 was
synthesized by combining GO and Co(NO3)2·6H2O under hydrothermal conditions, and the rGO/Co2P catalysts are obtained by annealing at different temperatures and
named as rGO/Co2P-temperature. The representative scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of the rGO/Co2P samples
present a sheet-like structure, with the metal phosphide particles
evenly distributed on the rGO layers (Figure S1). Figures 1a and S2 show rGO/Co2P-600–900 samples
have similar morphologies, but as the pyrolysis temperature increases,
the size of Co2P nanoparticles increases. The sample of
rGO/Co2P-800 has Co2P particles of size of around
16–18 nm that are uniformly distributed on the rGO surface
(Figure 1b). The Co2P particles of other samples have a size of around 10–25
nm and are distributed at the center of the rGO surface. The high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image shows that the lattice
fringe space is 0.208 nm, which is consistent with the (111) planes
of Co2P. The lattice fringe spacing of 0.21 nm corresponds
to the rGO plane (100) (Figure 1c). The elemental mappings are shown in Figure 1d–h, indicating that the spherical
Co2P particles are uniformly distributed on the rGO layer.
The electron energy spectrum (EDS) of the sample is shown in Figure 1i, further proving
the existence of Co, P, C, and O, and the ratio of the elements Co
and P is 2:1.

Figure 1 (a) TEM, (b) high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM
(inset
image is the particle size distribution of the sample), and (c) HRTEM
image of rGO/Co2P-800 (inset image is the electron diffraction
pattern of rGO); energy-dispersive X-ray mappings for (d) C, (e) O,
(f) Co, (g) P, and (h) full spectrum; and (i) EDS (inset image is
the element content) of the rGO/Co2P-800 sample.

Figure 2a shows
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of different materials. The 2θ
value of 10.8° for pure rGO corresponds to the (100) crystal
plane of GO (JCPDS 01-081-2220). Several distinct characteristic peaks
of Co2P in the rGO/Co2P samples at 2θ
of 30–50° are due to the (112), (211), and (020) crystal
planes of Co2P (JCPDS: 98-006-6703). According to the characterization,
the doping of rGO promotes the growth rate of Co2P along
the [211] direction, which can increase the specific surface area
and the exposure of active sites, as well as promote electron transfer.
The Raman spectra of each catalyst as well as pure GO and Co2P are shown in Figure 2b. The two different peaks at ∼1341 and 1588 cm–1 are ascribed to the D band and G band, respectively.45,46 The rGO/Co2P-800 sample has the highest ID/IG intensity ratio of 0.98.
The results show that more defects are produced during the preparation
of rGO/Co2P, which are helpful for improving the electrochemical
performance. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms are
displayed in Figure 2c. The sharp peaks at the relative pressure P/P0 < 0.1 in the adsorption isotherms indicate
that the rGO/Co2P-800 sample has abundant micropores. Meanwhile,
rGO/Co2P-800 has higher Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface area and pore volumes of about 49.53 m2 g–1 and 0.06 m3 g–1 than bare Co2P (15.53 m2 g–1 and 0.02 m3 g–1), respectively. These microstructures can
facilitate the exposure of active sites, having a positive impact
on the catalytic efficiency.

Co2P,
and rGO/Co2P-600–900 samples; (c) N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms of rGO, Co2P, and rGO/Co2P-800.

The interactions of each component were further
studied by X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Figure 3a shows four main peaks located at 130.2,
284.4, 529.7, and 778.2 eV, corresponding to P 2p, C 1s, O 1s, and
Co 2p, respectively. Figure 3b exhibits the C 1s spectra of pure Co2P and the
rGO/Co2P-800 sample. The main peak at 284 eV is attributed
to the sp2-hybridized graphitic carbon C–C47,48 and C=C49 bonds; the peak at 285.4
eV is relatively weak and belongs to the C–O and C–N50 bonds. The peak at 287.7 eV is attributed to
the C=O bond. After combining with Co2P, the C 1s
peak shifts toward the direction of low binding energy, indicating
that Co2P is more likely to transfer electrons to the rGO
layer. The Co 2p spectrum shows two peaks at about 779.12 and 793.96
eV that can be ascribed to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/251 (Figure 3c). The Co 2p spectrum of rGO/Co2P-800 can
be divided into four peaks. The peaks at 778.2 and 793.3 eV are ascribed
to Co0. The peaks at 781.3 and 796.5 eV are related to
Co2+. The surface of the metal Co was oxidized, which is
the reason for the existence of Co2+.52 The peaks at 785.8 and 802.1 eV are assigned to the satellite
peaks from the shakeup processes.53 When
combined with rGO, the peaks corresponding to Co2+ increase
obviously. This shows that rGO can promote the reduction of Co2P. As shown in Figure 3d, the two characteristic peaks at 129.9 and 130.4 eV are
attributed to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks of P.54 After combining with rGO, the P 2p peaks move
toward the direction of high binding energy. This is consistent with
the XPS variation of the above Co element. Such changes of the Co
surface electronic density demonstrate an interplay between Co2P nanoparticles and rGO layers. Moreover, rGO is more likely
to facilitate the adjustment and control of the electronic configuration
of the rGO surface. In summary, the combination of rGO and Co2P is beneficial to the improvement of the catalytic efficiency.

3.2 Electrochemical
Performance of HER and OER
We used a three-electrode system
to study the electrocatalytic
performance of HER and OER in 1 M KOH, 0.5 M H2SO4, and 1.0 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) electrolytes. First,
we tested and measured a series of rGO/Co2P samples in
1.0 M KOH. Figure 4a shows that the rGO/Co2P-800 catalyst exhibits a high
catalytic performance with overpotentials of 134 and 304 mV at 10
and 100 mA cm–2 (defined as η10 and η100), respectively. The rGO/Co2P-600, rGO/Co2P-700, and rGO/Co2P-900 samples
are also prepared for comparison. They provide overpotentials of 206,
188, and 178 mV at η10, higher than that of rGO/Co2P-800. In addition, 20 wt% Pt/C, bare rGO, and Co2P are also tested for comparison. The overpotential of the composite
catalyst is greatly improved relative to the comparison samples of
rGO (492 mV) and Co2P (478 mV), and compared with similar
non-noble metal phosphides, it also has better catalytic activity
(Table S1). Figure 4b exhibits the Tafel plots of the rGO/Co2P samples in alkaline solution. Compared to rGO/Co2P-600 (99 mV dec–1), rGO/Co2P-700 (62
mV dec–1), and rGO/Co2P-900 (64 mV dec–1), rGO/Co2P-800 shows a more lower Tafel
slope of 58 mV dec–1, which is close to that of
commercial Pt/C (37 mV dec–1).

curves and (b,e) corresponding Tafel plots
of the series of samples in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4. (c,f) Polarization curves before and after 10,000 cycles
of the rGO/Co2P-800 sample (inset is the chronopotentiometry
testing for 48 h at a current density of 10 mA cm–2) in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively.

Besides, the catalyst is further examined in the
acid electrolyte
(0.5 M H2SO4, pH = 0). Figure 4b exhibits that the rGO/Co2P-800
sample has a low η10 of 189 mV, which is superior
to the η10 values of rGO/Co2P-600 (235
mV), rGO/Co2P-700 (216 mV), rGO/Co2P-900 (209
mV), and Co2P (345 mV) . When Co2P is combined
with rGO, the catalytic activity is significantly increased. Such
an improved catalytic performance is likely because of the following
reasons: (a) in terms of components, the Co2P particles
formed by phosphating treatment can effectively increase the defects
and produce a high density of active centers; (b) structurally, Co2P nanoparticles are beneficial with the exposure of active
sites because of their uniform size and high dispersion on the rGO
layers, and a high temperature can increase the interaction between
Co2P and rGO; and (c) rGO can effectively improve the conductivity
of materials.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is
performed in an
alkaline solution to further investigate the interfacial electron-transfer
kinetics of the catalyst for HER (Figure S6a). rGO/Co2P-800 has the lowest charge-transfer resistance
(Rct) of 25.2 Ω compared to rGO/Co2P-600 (58.1 Ω), rGO/Co2P-700 (34.1 Ω),
and rGO/Co2P-900 (39.3) (Table S2). It is shown that the sample of rGO/Co2P-800 can substantially
improve the interfacial intrinsic HER dynamics.

Stability is
an important criterion to judge whether an electrocatalyst
can be used in practice. The durability of rGO/Co2P-800
was tested by recording the polarization curves at 1st, 1000th, 2000th,
4000th, 8000th, and 10,000th cycles (Figure 4c). The result shows the excellent durability
of the rGO/Co2P-800 catalyst after 1000 cyclic voltammetry
(CV) cycles; the overpotential of each cycle has no obvious attenuation
compared with the previous one, not only in alkaline solution but
also in the acidic electrolyte. Pure Co2P was examined
under the selfsame conditions (Figure S7), and the results showed that the stability of the samples after
compounding with rGO was significantly improved. In addition, the
stability of rGO/Co2P-800 was evaluated using chronometric
technology. After 48 h of unceasing operation at 10 mA cm–2, the current density remained almost unchanged. The result also
indicates that rGO/Co2P-800 has excellent durability and
stability. These two tests were carried out in acidic media, and the
superior durability and stability of rGO/Co2P-800 were
also confirmed (Figures 4f and 5c). To illustrate, we attach a TEM
image of the sample catalyzed in an acid electrolyte (Figure S8), which is not significantly different
from that before catalysis; this also shows that the sample has excellent
stability.

Figure 5 (a) OER polarization curves and (b) corresponding Tafel slopes
of the series samples. (c) Polarization curves before and after 10,000
cycles of rGO/Co2P-800 (inset is the chronopotentiometry
testing for 48 h at a current density of 10 mA cm–2) in 1.0 M KOH; (d) EIS spectra of samples.

After 400 s of operation at 1.0 M KOH, the poisoning tests were
performed in a mixed solution of 1.0 M KOH and sodium thiocyanate. Figure S9 shows that rGO has no obvious attenuation.
Because of the absence of a carrier support, the current density of
Co2P falls from 10 mA cm–2 to approximately
0 mA cm–2. The current density of the rGO/Co2P material shows less attenuation because of the protection
of the carbon layers. In addition, the C-based support contributes
to the dispersion of Co2P nanoparticles, producing highly
active sites to catalyze water electrolysis.

The overall water
decomposition requires excellent OER catalytic
performances, and OER is measured in 1.0 M KOH. Commercial RuO2 was used as the sample for comparison. The η10 values of rGO/Co2P-600, rGO/Co2P-700, rGO/Co2P-800, and rGO/Co2P-900 were 432, 409, 378, and
405 mV, respectively (Figure 5a). As shown in Figure 5b, the Tafel slope of rGO/Co2P-800 (77 mV dec–1) is far below that of rGO (186 mV dec–1) and Co2P (109 mV dec–1), respectively,
which is close to that of RuO2 (49 mV dec–1). The comparison with similar materials is shown in Table S4, indicating that the rGO/Co2P-800 catalyst shows a relatively higher performance. The durability
of rGO/Co2P-800 is tested, and the results of CV and chronoamperometry
reveal almost no attenuation. It shows the high durability of rGO/Co2P-800. The EIS curves indicate that the charge-transfer resistance
(Rct) values of rGO/Co2P-600,
rGO/Co2P-700, rGO/Co2P-800, and rGO/Co2P-900 are 42.1, 29.9, 21.8, and 30.2 Ω (Figure 5d), respectively. The low charge-transfer
resistance of the rGO/Co2P-800 catalyst indicates the great
improvement of OER reaction kinetics. To further evaluate the intrinsic
activity of the materials, the catalytic activity is assessed by calculating
the turnover frequency (TOF) (Table S5).
rGO/Co2P-800 shows a higher TOF value (0.041 s–1), which is close to η300 of RuO2 (0.052
s–1), indicating that the catalyst has excellent
performance. Moreover, rGO/Co2P-800 has a high Cdl of 53 mF cm–2 and an electrochemically
active surface area of 298 mF cm–2, and it is better
than that of RuO2 (30 mF cm–2 and 147.8
mF cm–2).

The rGO/Co2P catalyst
not only shows excellent catalytic
performance under alkaline and acidic conditions but also possesses
superior HER activity under neutral conditions. Figure S10 shows the linear sweep voltammetry curves of rGO/Co2P-600, rGO/Co2P-700, rGO/Co2P-800, rGO/Co2P-900, rGO, Co2P, and Pt/C tested in a 1 M PBS
buffer solution. It can be seen from the figure that the rGO/Co2P-800 catalyst shows good performance. The η10 value of rGO/Co2P-800 is 218 mV, which is second only
to commercial Pt/C, indicating that the synergistic effect of rGO
and Co2P significantly improved the hydrogen evolution
catalytic activity.

Encouraged by the outstanding HER and OER
performances of rGO/Co2P samples and their potential for
practical applications,
we employed a three-electrode system to investigate the overall water-splitting
performance of rGO/Co2P-800. The voltage gap of rGO/Co2P-800 (1.78 V) is close to that of RuO2 (1.64 V)
and Pt/C (1.72 V) (Figure 6). rGO/Co2P-800 shows a remarkable electrochemical
water-splitting activity, which was expected to develop low-price
materials to replace noble-metal catalysts.

system.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we successfully prepared highly efficient rGO/Co2P catalysts with superior catalytic performances and stability
for overall water splitting using the convenient hydrothermal and
H2 reduction methods. We explored different reduction temperatures
and found the optimum one (rGO/Co2P-800). Through the synergistic
effect between rGO and Co2P, the catalytic performance
is significantly improved. rGO/Co2P-800, as a bifunctional
catalyst, displays small η10 of 134 mV (in 1 M KOH)
and 189 mV (in 0.5 M H2SO4) for HER and 387
mV for OER. The sample shows superior catalytic activity, which is
reflected in its TOF value (η100 of 0.5 and 0.62
s–1 for HER and η300 of 0.041 s–1 for OER). Meanwhile, the sample also maintains excellent
electrochemical stability after long cycle tests, which is ascribed
to its unique carbon ring protection. This work proposes an exciting
new route to develop high-active and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts
for renewable clean energy systems.
