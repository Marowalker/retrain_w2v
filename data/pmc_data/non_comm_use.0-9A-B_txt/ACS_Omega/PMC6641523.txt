MXenes, a new family
of two-dimensional materials, have recently
attracted increasing attention due to their unique properties for
a wide range of potential applications. Herein, we synthesize Ti3C2Tx/poly(vinyl alcohol)
(PVA) composites and investigate the effects of the thermal properties
of MXene by temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy and polarized-laser
power-dependent Raman spectroscopy. Compared to the Ti3C2Tx MXene, the PVA significantly
improves the thermal stability of Ti3C2Tx by reducing the thermal coefficient of the
Eg1 mode from −0.06271 to −0.03357
cm–1/K, which is attributed to the strong Ti–O
bonds formed between the MXene and PVA polymer confirmed by the X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy results. Meanwhile, the thermal conductivities
of Ti3C2Tx and Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites
reach as high as about 55.8 and 47.6 W/(m K), respectively. Overall,
this work will contribute to extend the MXene applications in terms
of polymer-based nanocomposites and improve the reliability of the
related devices effectively.

1 Introduction
Since the discovery of
graphene, two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystals
have attracted increasing scientific research interest owing to their
high surface areas and unique properties that differ from the corresponding
three-dimensional analogues.1 Among these
materials, MXenes, a recently discovered family of 2D transition-metal
carbides or carbonitrides, shed new light on the development of energy
conversion and storage devices.2−6 Normally, MXenes are produced by the selective chemical etching
of “A” elements (mostly Al or Si) from the layered ceramics
called MAX phases.7 The MAX phases are
generally represented by the formula Mn+1AXn, where M is an early transition metal,
X is carbon and/or nitrogen, and n = 1, 2, or 3.
Because MXenes are synthesized in fluoride-containing aqueous solutions,
their surfaces are inevitably terminated with a mixture of −O,
−F, and −OH groups.8,9 Henceforth,
these terminated MXenes will be labeled as Mn+1XnTx, where T represents the terminating groups and x is the number of terminating groups. MXenes are multilayered structures
resembling those of exfoliated graphite and can be delaminated into
single- or few-layer nanosheets, which dramatically increase the accessible
surface.10 Many members of the MXene family
exhibit metallic conductivity, surface hydrophilicity, and excellent
mechanical properties.11−13 Furthermore, the optoelectronic properties of these
materials can be finely tuned by changing the intercalation products
between the MXene sublayers.14 To date,
MXenes have already been proved to be promising candidates for electrodes
in lithium (Li)- and sodium (Na)-ion batteries15−17 and supercapacitors,18−20 as well as shown a great potential in the applications of water
purification21−23 and sensors.24,25 In addition, theoretical
studies suggest that several members of this family, such as Ti2C and Mo2C, can become potential candidates for
hydrogen storage26 and thermoelectric applications.27 Meanwhile, MXenes can also be used to produce
functional nanocomposites due to their functionalized surfaces and
2D morphology. The key factor to introduce polymer matrices into MXenes
is the utilization of cationic-charged or hydrogen-bond-forming polymers
to achieve a strong interaction with negatively charged OH/F/O-terminated
MXene surface.28Previously, Ti3C2Tx MXene was attempted to
mix with charged diallyldimethylammonium chloride, polydiallyldimethylammonium,
electrically neutral poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), or polyacrylamide
(PAM) to produce Ti3C2Tx/polymer nanocomposite systems.28,29 Using dimethylsulfoxide,
uniform and flexible Ti3C2Tx/PAM composites with only 6 wt % (1.7 vol %) MXene loading
were obtained with an electrical conductivity of about 3.3 ×
10–2 S/m.30 Ling et al.
reported that the Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites showed electrical conductivity as high as
2.2 × 104 S/m, whereas the measured electrical conductivity
of pure Ti3C2Tx films
was about 2.4 × 105 S/m.28 In addition, the tensile strength of the Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites was significantly enhanced
from 22 ± 2 to 91 ± 10 MPa compared to the pure Ti3C2Tx films. The introduction
and confinement of the polymer between the MXene flakes not only increased
flexibility, but also stimulated cationic intercalation, offering
an impressive volumetric capacitance of ∼530 F/cm3 for MXene/PVA–KOH composite films at 2 mV/s. This implies
that MXenes are promising fillers in multifunctional polymer composites,
which in turn can be employed in many applications such as flexible
and wearable energy-storage devices, radio frequency shielding, water
filtration system, and so on. Raman spectroscopy, a nondestructive
method, is typically used to investigate the strain distribution and
thermal stability of a material by assessing its Raman frequency shifts
and related thermal coefficients.31,32 In light of
the importance of MXene/polymer composite systems, in this study,
we fabricated uniform Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites and explored their thermal stability and
thermal conductivity by temperature-dependent and polarized-laser
power-dependent Raman measurements. The results demonstrate that the
introduction of PVA significantly improves the thermal stability of
the composites in comparison to the pure Ti3C2Tx. Meanwhile, the thermal conductivity
of Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites
also stays at high level. These results will have a great impact on
the reliability of the related devices.

2 Experimental
Section
Figure 1 provides
a general overview of the fabrication process of Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites. A piece of
the Ti3AlC2 monolith (1 g) was immersed into
10 mL of 50 wt % hydrofluoric acid solution for 18 h at room temperature
to dissolve the Al atoms. The resulting suspension of multilayered
Ti3C2Tx was repeatedly
washed with deionized water six to eight times, centrifuged at 1500
rpm for 10 min, and decanted until the supernatant reached a pH of
∼6. The separated wet sediment was dried under vacuum for 24
h before further experiments. PVA with a molecular weight of about
67 000 g/mol in 1 wt % aqueous solutions was prepared. The
Ti3C2Tx MXene solution
(1 g/500 mL water) was put into the PVA solutions. The weight ratio
of Ti3C2Tx to PVA
can be adjusted by their initial weights. The combined mixture was
vortexed for 1 h, then sonicated for 30 min at the power of 100 W
until the solution attained visual homogeneity, and centrifuged at
1500 rpm for 10 min. Finally, the Ti3C2Tx/PVA wet sediment was dried at 60 °C under
vacuum for 24 h and the residual was the Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites. The Ti3C2Tx/PVA composite film was
obtained by filtration through poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane
and dried in vacuum at room temperature.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of
the fabrication process of Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites.

A powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker, D8 Advance) with
Cu
Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) was used to obtain the X-ray
powder diffraction patterns for the Ti3AlC2,
pristine Ti3C2Tx MXene, and Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites. The morphologies of the Ti3C2Tx MXene and Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites were characterized
by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Hitachi SU-70) and a transmission
electron microscope (TEM) (Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin) operated at an accelerating
voltage of 200 kV. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed by a thermal
gravimetric analyzer (Netzsch, TG 209F1) in nitrogen atmosphere and
oxygen atmosphere. The heating rate was 10 K/min. Raman spectroscopy
measurements were carried out in a confocal microscopy setup with
a 532 nm solid-state green laser for excitation. The temperature ranging
from 300 K (room temperature) to 480 K was controlled by a heating
stage. Polarized-laser power-dependent Raman measurements were performed
at 0.01P0, 0.1P0, 0.25P0, 0.5P0, 0.75P0, and P0, where P0 = 2.5 mW. And thermal
conductivities of the pristine Ti3C2Tx MXene and Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites were also confirmed by a laser
thermal conductivity test instrument (Netzsch, LFA 427) at room temperature.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were carried out in
a VG ESCALAB 220i-XL system equipped with a monochromatized Al Kα
X-ray source (1486.6 eV), a multichannel plate, and a delay-line detector
under a vacuum of 1 × 10–9 mbar. High-resolution
(HR) spectra were collected at a constant pass energy of 20 eV and
quantified using empirically derived relative sensitivity factors
provided by Kratos Analytical. Binding energies were referenced to
the C 1s peak of the C–C bond at 284.80 eV. The data were analyzed
by commercially available software CasaXPS.

3 Results
and Discussion
Figure 2 shows the
XRD patterns of Ti3AlC2, as-prepared Ti3C2Tx powders, and the
corresponding Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites. It can be readily observed that the (002) peak of
the Ti3AlC2 MAX phase shifts toward lower angles
from about 9.60–8.60° (Ti3C2Tx MXene) and 7.80° (Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites), which indicated
the increase of the c lattice parameter. According
to the Bragg formula 2d sin θ
= nλ, where θ is the Bragg angle, d is the interplanar spacing, and λ is the wavelength
of the incident X-ray (0.15406 nm), the d parameters
of the Ti3AlC2 MAX, Ti3C2Tx MXene, and Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites are about 18.34, 20.54,
and 22.10 Å, respectively. This demonstrates that the PVA can
interact with Ti3C2Tx MXene. The surface functional groups of MXene are changed, which
enlarges the d-spacing of MXene sheets. In addition,
the broadening of the (002) peaks in the Ti3C2Tx MXene compared to that in the MAX
phase mainly attributes to the decreasing structure order.11

Figure 2 XRD patterns of Ti3AlC2, Ti3C2Tx MXene, and Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites.

The as-synthesized Ti3C2Tx has a layered morphology
resembling exfoliated graphite,
as shown in Figure 3a. The enlarged view of Ti3C2Tx (Figure 3b) indicates the clear layered structure. However, in Figure 3c, after introduction
of PVA, the sheets stack together because the hydroxyl in the PVA
reacted with the −OH-terminated MXene surface (−OH +
−OH = −O– + H2O) and formed Ti–O
bonds at the surface, which is confirmed by the XPS results. The enlarged
view of Ti3C2Tx/PVA
composites (Figure 3d) indicates compact layered structure. To further explore the structure
changes of Ti3C2Tx MXene after the PVA reaction, the material is also characterized
by TEM, as displayed in Figure 4. Figure 4a,d
exhibit the two-dimensional nanosheets of Ti3C2Tx and Ti3C2Tx/PVA, respectively. The exfoliated slices are
very thin and disperse as single layer or stack of several layers.
The inset selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns in Figure 4b,e show that the
crystal planes of the MXenes are hexagonal systemic, indicating that
the PVA does not change the crystal type. Furthermore, the space parameters
of both the Ti3C2Tx and Ti3C2Tx/PVA
composites corresponding to (101̅0) planes are measured to be
about 0.2656 and 0.2595 nm, respectively. On the basis of the above
values, the lattice constant a is about 0.3070 nm
for Ti3C2Tx and
0.2982 nm for Ti3C2Tx/PVA. Therefore, it demonstrates that the original basal plane structure
of the Ti3C2Tx MXene
shrinks a little after the PVA treatment coupled with the lattice
expansion along the c axis. Figure 4c,f shows the cross sections of the multilayered
Ti3C2Tx MXene and
Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites,
respectively. The nanosheets are stacked less uniformly in Ti3C2Tx/PVA than in Ti3C2Tx due to the polymer
reaction.

Figure 5a
shows
the TG curve of Ti3C2Tx in nitrogen atmosphere. The temperature is from room temperature
to 950 °C. There are three weight-change steps. The first step
is due to the release of free water adsorbed on the surface of Ti3C2Tx. The second step
is due to the release of bonding water and functional groups on the
surface of Ti3C2Tx. The third step is due to the decomposition of Ti3C2Tx MXene. The decomposition temperature
of pure Ti3C2Tx MXene
is about 785 °C. Figure 5b shows the TG curve of Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites in nitrogen atmosphere. The
temperature is also from room temperature to 950 °C. There are
four weight-change steps compared to Ti3C2Tx MXene. The temperature from 220 to 480 °C
is the decomposition temperature of PVA. The content of PVA is 12.71%
in the composites in our experiment. The decomposition temperature
of Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites
is about 823 °C, which is higher than that of Ti3C2Tx MXene. So, the thermal stability
of Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites
is better than that of Ti3C2Tx MXene in nitrogen atmosphere. Figure 5c shows the TG curve of Ti3C2Tx in oxygen atmosphere. The temperature
is from room temperature to 950 °C. There are four weight-change
steps. We note that from 322 to 729 °C, the mass increases 19.98%,
which is due to the oxidation of MXene. The oxidation temperature
of Ti3C2Tx MXene
is about 322 °C, and the decomposition temperature of MXene is
about 729 °C. Figure 5d shows the TG curve of Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites in oxygen atmosphere. The temperature
is from room temperature to 950 °C. There are five weight-change
steps. The oxidation temperature of the composites is about 530 °C,
and the decomposition temperature of the composites is about 811 °C.
The result indicates a better thermal stability of Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites than pure Ti3C2Tx MXene in oxygen
atmosphere. So, from our TG results, the introduction of PVA can improve
the thermal stability of Ti3C2Tx in both nitrogen and oxygen atmosphere.

Raman spectroscopy is
a powerful tool to investigate the atomic
bonds, thermal stability, and thermal conductivity of two-dimensional
materials, such as black phosphorus, MoS2, graphene, and
so on.33−35 In this work, temperature-dependent Raman measurements
ranging from 300 to 480 K were carried out for both Ti3C2Tx MXenes and Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites. Raman
frequency spectra with increasing temperature are plotted in Figure 6a,c. In Ti3C2Tx, the Raman frequency
of about 156 cm–1 (Eg1 mode)
at room temperature is mainly from the in-plane vibrations of Ti2
and C atoms, as illustrated in Figure 6e. Besides, the Raman peaks at 606 cm–1 (Eg2  mode) and 440 cm–1 in the Ti3C2Tx/PVA composite are attributed to the in-plane vibrations of C and
O atoms, respectively. However, the Eg1 mode
shifts to a lower wave number at about 146.4 cm–1 in the Ti3C2Tx/PVA composite. It can be inferred that the PVA polymer weakens the
in-plane motion of the Ti2 and C atoms. In comparison to the bare
Ti3C2 nanosheet, the T-terminated Ti3C2 normally has a smaller a parameter
and a larger d spacing while the atoms remain in
the same Wyckoff positions. The XRD and TEM results have demonstrated
that the c and a lattice parameters
are enlarged about 1.56 Å and reduced 0.088 Å, respectively,
after the PVA treatment. As a result, the Ti2 atoms are pushed out
a little from the plane, then the bond length between the Ti1 and
C atoms shrinks, whereas that between the Ti2 and C atoms is elongated,
and in turn weakens the in-plane vibrations of Ti2 and C atoms. From Figure 6b,d, the Raman phonon
mode Eg1 obviously exhibits red shift from 300
to 480 K and can be fitted by a linear equation: ω = ω0 + χΔT, where ω0 is the mode frequency at room temperature, χ is the first-order
temperature coefficient, and ΔT is the temperature
difference relative to 300 K. The measured χ value for the Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites
is about −0.03357 ± 0.00023 cm–1/K,
which is much smaller than the corresponding value −0.06271
± 0.00045 cm–1/K of the Ti3C2Tx MXenes, indicating a better
thermal stability in the former. Several data point dispersions are
attributed to slight variation in the laser spot focused on the material.
The observed softening of the Raman peaks with increasing temperature
arises from an anharmonicity, which is related to the harmonic potential
constant, the phonon occupation, as well as the thermal expansion
of the crystal.36 The improvement of thermal
stability in the Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites is primarily contributed to the surface modification
introduced by the PVA treatment. Therefore, it is essential to explore
the change of the chemical bonding.

composites from 300

temperature including a linear fit. (e) Schematic illustration of
the Raman modes.

XPS investigations were
performed to characterize the chemical
compositions of the prepared MXene powders and composites. A detailed
survey spectrum for both samples shows the presence of Ti, oxygen
(O), fluorine (F), and carbon (C) (not shown here). The relative high-resolution
XPS images of Ti 2p and O 1s are shown in Figure 7. The Ti 2p component centered at 455.9 eV
is associated with the Ti–C bonds, whereas that at about 461
eV can be assigned to the Ti–O and Ti–F bonds, which
are totally referred as Ti–OxFy.37,38 Compared to the pure
Ti3C2Tx MXene, the
peak integrated intensity ratio of Ti–OxFy to Ti–C increases
from about 0.425 to 0.693 in the Ti3C2Tx/PVA composite, which indicates that more Ti–OxFy bonds are formed
after PVA intercalation. Similarly, the O 1s XPS images with Ti–O
bond at about 529.0 eV, Ti–OH bond at 532.0 eV,39 and C–O bond at 533.1 eV are presented
in Figure 7b,d. The
intensity ratio of Ti–O bond to Ti–OH bond is about
0.657 in Ti3C2Tx MXene, whereas that in the Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites increases to about 0.859, which indicates
that more Ti–O bonds are formed after the PVA treatment. The
result is consistent with the results of Ti 2p XPS. Overall, the PVA
polymer can conjugate with the Ti3C2Tx MXene effectively in terms of −Ti–O
bond forming Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites. In Ti3C2Tx MXenes, the bond lengths of Ti–O, Ti–F, and
Ti–OH are 1.97, 2.17, and 2.19 Å, respectively, indicating
that Ti–O bond is the most stable one among the terminated
groups.40 Generally, the strong terminal
Ti–O bond significantly weakens the vibrations in which the
surface Ti atoms are involved and increases the material thermal stability
greatly, especially in the Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites where the PVA polymer profoundly
increases the relative intensity of Ti–O bond declared by the
XPS results. Otherwise, one PVA molecular (C2H4O)n includes much −OH groups,
which promotes PVA polymer cladding on the Ti3C2Tx MXene effectively. This is also helpful
to improve the thermal stability and prevent Ti3C2Tx MXene from oxidation and rolling into
conical shape. Thus, the PVA polymer has great impacts on the thermal
properties of MXenes, and it is reasonable to assume that it would
be possible to tune the thermal stability or thermal conductivity
of the Ti3C2Tx/PVA
composites by controlling the Ti3C2Tx-to-PVA ratio.

Figure 7 High-resolution Ti 2p and O 1s XPS images
of (a, b) Ti3C2Tx MXene and (c, d) Ti3C2Tx/PVA composite.

To obtain the thermal conductivity, polarized-laser power-dependent
Raman spectra were recorded, as displayed in Figure 8a,b. The maximum laser power P0 was about 2.5 mW measured at the exit of the microscope
lens and can be reduced using an optical attenuator. Obvious frequency
red shift of the Raman peaks with increasing laser power was discovered,
which arose from the local laser heating effect. Figure 8c,d show the red shift of the
Eg1 mode frequency derived from the power-dependent
Raman spectra. The ∂ω/∂p coefficients
for the Ti3C2Tx MXene
and Ti3C2Tx/PVA
composite films are about 968 and 1081 cm–1/W, respectively.
For two-dimensional materials with thin-film structure, the thermal
conductivity can be expressed as 1  where χ
is the first temperature coefficient
of the Eg1 for the Ti3C2Tx MXene and Ti3C2Tx/PVA composite films and h is the thickness of the film. Taking the related values into eq 1, the thermal conductivities
of the Ti3C2Tx and
Ti3C2Tx/PVA composite
films are about 55.8 and 47.6 W/(m K), respectively.

films under different laser power. Power dependence of Eg1  mode of (c) Ti3C2Tx MXene and (d) Ti3C2Tx/PVA composite films including linear fits of
the experimental data.

To confirm the thermal conductivity results, the laser flash
method
was also performed. The samples were cut into circular specimens with
a diameter of 20 mm and a thickness of 3 mm. The experiments were
carried at room temperature. The thermal conductivities of the Ti3C2Tx and Ti3C2Tx/PVA composite films are
tested for 55.2 ± 1.7 and 47.3 ± 1.2 W/(m K), respectively,
which are in accordance with the polarized-laser power-dependent Raman
test results. With the introduction of PVA, the conductivity of the
Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites
decreases little from pure Ti3C2Tx MXene. And the conductivity of the Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites can still
surpass that of Fe (47.4 W/(m K)), SiO2 (7.6 W/(m K)),
Al2O3 (45 W/(m K)), stainless steel (40 W/(m
K)), and most of the other two-dimensional materials. Our results
show that the Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites exhibit high thermal stability and thermal conductivity
and can be used in many areas, such as supercapacitors, Li-ion batteries,
solar cells, electromagnetic shielding, and so on.

4 Summary
In conclusion, high-thermal-stability and high-thermal-conductivity
Ti3C2Tx/PVA composites
is prepared in our work. The effects of PVA polymer on the thermal
properties of Ti3C2Tx MXene are investigated. The PVA polymer significantly improves the
thermal stability of the MXene by introducing strong Ti–O bonds
and cladding on the surface of the Ti3C2Tx MXene without changing the crystal structure
largely. The thermal conductivities of Ti3C2Tx and Ti3C2Tx/PVA are about 55.8 and 47.6 W/(m K), respectively,
which are even higher than those of some metals and most of the other
two-dimensional materials. This study makes a crucial step to explore
the potential use of MXene in polymer-based nanocomposites for a host
of applications (e.g., energy-storage devices, water filtration system,
thermoelectric devices, and Aeronautics and Astronautics materials)
in harsh environment.
