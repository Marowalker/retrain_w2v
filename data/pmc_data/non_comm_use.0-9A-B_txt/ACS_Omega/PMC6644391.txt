A computational study via periodic
density functional theory of
porous nanotubes derived from single-layer surfaces of porous hexagonal
boron nitride nanotubes (PBNNTs) and inorganic graphenylene-like boron
nitride nanotubes (IGP-BNNTs) has been carried out with the main focus
in its piezoelectric behavior. The simulations showed that the strain
provides a meaningful improve in the piezoelectric response on the
zigzag porous boron nitride nanotubes. Additionally, its stability,
possible formation, elastic, and electronic properties were analyzed,
and for comparison purpose, the porous graphene and graphenylene nanotubes
were studied. From the elastic properties study, it was found that
IGP-BNNTs exhibited a higher rigidity because of the influence of
the superficial porous area, as compared to PBNNTs. The present study
provides evidence that the strain is a way to maximize the piezoelectric
response and make this material a good candidate for electromechanical
devices.

1 Introduction
Because
of the discovery of graphene,1 the interest
in carbon-based structures with honeycomb networks
has considerably increased because of their potential applications
in nanodevices,1,2 supercapacitors,3 theranostics,4 immunotherapy,5 and fuel cells.6 However,
the zero band gap of graphene can limit its application in specific
electronic devices; thus, there has been considerable activity in
the development of techniques to overcome this limitation. Modifications
to the structural, electronic, and chemical properties of graphene
using different chemical7−10 and physical11−13 methods, or application of an
electromagnetic field,14 have been utilized
to open and find a band gap suitable for electronic device applications.

Other alternative to surpass the current limitations of graphene
structures is the inorganic graphene analogues, such as silicene,15,16 germanene,17 and hexagonal boron nitride
(hBN),18 because of their interesting properties.
In addition, an ordered pore formation can be used as an alternative
to modify their properties and confer various desirable characteristics,
for example, as seen in recent graphene derivatives such as porous
graphene (PG)19−23 and graphenylene (GP),23−26 which, unlike graphene, have semiconducting behavior.
Recently, Yu and co-workers showed that GP has a great potential as
an anode material for lithium batteries with high-storage capabilities27 as well as a molecular sieve for gas.28

On the other hand, hBN is of particular
interest as it has the
same honeycomb topology and similar bond lengths and lattice parameters
(with a mismatch of ∼1.8%) as graphene29 but has different electronic properties with a wide band gap of
∼5.96 eV.30

In a recent paper,
it was presented that the inorganic counterparts
for PG and GP surfaces, namely porous boron nitride (PBN) and inorganic
GP-like boron nitride (IGP-BN) structures,23 both of which have a similar band gap to hBN. However, unlike GP,
IGP-BN is not suitable for direct use as an anode material but requires
prior doping with carbon atoms, as shown by Hankel and Searles.31

The idea of rolling up a single-layer
surface to construct nanotubes
opens numerous possibilities for the applications, from energy harvesting
and storage to molecular sieves.32 Furthermore,
the production of nanotubes has been extended to inorganic materials
such as zinc oxide,33 titanium dioxide,34 aluminum nitride,35 boron nitride,36 and other systems. These
inorganic nanotubes can have advantages over CNTs in certain applications,
such as electronics, because of their unique properties.37,38

In 2015, Koch et al.39 proposed
GP nanotubes
(GPNTs) and used plane-wave density functional theory (DFT) combined
with a Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional [in comparison
with the density functional tight binding (DFTB)] to calculate metallic
characteristics for armchair nanotubes with small diameters and small
band gap semiconducting characteristics for nanotubes with larger
diameters; they also show that GPNTs also have a promising lithium
storage application because it retains their mechanical properties
during charging cycles.

Fabris et al.40 studied PG nanotubes
(PGNTs) and GPNTs for nanotubes with diameters less than 56 Å
using the DFTB method, which showed that PGNTs have a wide band gap
of ∼3.3 eV, whereas GPNTs have a small band gap of ∼0.7
eV. They also showed that as the diameter of the PGNTs increases,
the band gap decreases, whereas for GPNTs, the band gap increases
with the PGNT diameter; these results are in agreement with those
presented by Koch.

Although there have been several studies
on carbon-based porous
nanotubes, as described above, more detailed studies on the properties
of these structures are required, such as on the elastic, piezoelectric,
and vibrational properties.

Therefore, the present study proposes,
for the first time, an inorganic
counterpart for PGNTs and GPNTs, namely PBN nanotubes (PBNNTs) and
IGP-BN nanotubes (IGP-BNNTs). Here, the structural, electronic, elastic
properties, and the possible piezoelectricity activity of the armchair
and zigzag conformations of PBNNTs and IGP-BNNTs using a periodic
DFT methodology combined with a modified hybrid B3LYP functional and
a triple-zeta plus polarization (TZVP) all-electron basis set were
investigated.41 Additionally and for comparison
purpose were studied, at the same computational level, the properties
of PGNTs and GPNTs.

These theoretical findings may provide an
important information
for experimental research, opening a rational development to the designing
of alternative nanoelectronic devices.

2 Modeled
Systems
PBN and IGP-BN are described by the P6̅m2 and P6/m space group, respectively, where PBN has a direct wide
band gap
of 6.45 eV with one lattice parameter (a = b = 7.662 Å), and IGP-BN has an indirect wide band
gap of 5.52 eV with one lattice parameter (a = b = 6.818 Å).23

The
PG surface has an indirect wide band gap of 3.78 eV and belongs
to the space group C222 with two lattice parameters
(a = 7.426 Å and b = 7.437
Å). GP has a direct band gap of 0.83 eV and belongs to the P6/mmm symmetry group with one lattice
parameter (a = b = 6.735 Å).23

PG and PBN models, Figure 1, can be achieved by replacing each atom
of the graphene or
hBN unit cell by a benzene-like ring with three hydrogen atoms alternating
between two nonconsecutive atoms. Alternatively, GP and IGP-BN can
be obtained by replacing each atom of the unit cell with a dimer of
benzene-like rings joined by a square ring.

Figure 1 Generic scheme for porous
nanotube construction: (a) from PBN surface
forming PBNNTs with armchair (n, n) and zigzag (n, 0) symmetries; (b) from porous
inorganic GP surface forming inorganic GPNTs with armchair (n, n) and zigzag (n, 0)
symmetries.

The first step for the
construction of porous nanotubes involved
the total energy optimization of lattice parameters and internal coordinates
of the PBN, IGP-BN, PG, and GP porous surfaces. The second step was
to construct porous nanotubes from the optimized porous surfaces (see Figure 1).

Two rolling
directions of the surfaces are selected, zigzag (θ
= 0°) and armchair (θ = 30°), represented by the indices
(n, 0) and (n, n), respectively, where n is an integer that determines
the diameter and chirality of the nanotube (Figure 1). Armchair and zigzag porous nanotubes with n = 2, 3, ..., 10, 15, 20, 23, 25, 27, and 30 were selected.
In total, 15 armchair and zigzag nanotubes were constructed for each
of the four porous structures, resulting in a total of 120 nanotube
models.

The equations describing the number of atoms (nT) for porous nanotubes can be easily obtained
from the
equations for nonporous nanotubes.42 For
PGNTs and PBNNTs, nT = 36·(n2 + nm + m2)/dR, and for GPNTs and IGP-BNNTs, nT = 24·(n2 + nm + m2)/dR, where dR is the maximum common
divisor of (2n + m, 2m + n).

The diameter, D, of
porous nanotubes can be described
in an analogous form to a perfect carbon nanotube as a function of n and m and is defined by , where ahh is
the distance between two consecutive hexagons (in a typical carbon
nanotube, this would be the C–C bond length), as can be seen
in Figure 1. Thus,
the smallest and biggest nanotube has 48 atoms with ∼4 Å
of diameter, and the largest nanotube has 1080 atoms with ∼126
Å of diameter, respectively.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Structural Properties
To better understand
the stability and formation of these nanotubes, the energy necessary
to roll up a nanotube from the surface, known as strain energy, Estrain = (ENT/nNT) – Esurface, where Esurface is the total surface
energy, ENT is the total energy of the
nanotube, and nNT is the number of atoms
on the unit cell, was calculated.

Analysis of the Estrain can help to predict the nanotube conformation (armchair
or zigzag) which is probably formed and thus the most probable one
to be obtained experimentally. Figure 2 depicts the relationship between Estrain and the porous nanotube diameter.

Figure 2 Strain energy (eV/atom)
as a function of the diameter (Å)
for: (a) PBNNTs, (b) IGP-BNNTs, (c) PGNTs, and (d) GPNTs.

The number of atoms (nT), the optimized
nanotube diameter (D) and length (L), band gap energy (Egap), and strain
energy (Estrain) for PGNTs, GPNTs, PBNNTs,
and IGP-BNNTs are displayed in Tables S1 and S2, respectively (see Supporting Information).

In general, an
increase in the diameter implies a decrease in the
strain energy. As shown in Figure 2, there are a convergence in the (7, 7) and (10, 0)
nanotubes, indicating a convergence on diameter of ∼20 Å.
PBNNTs, IGP-BNNTs, and GPNTs exhibited a smooth decrease in the strain
energy but PGNTs had a small oscillation around −0.01 eV/atom.
These results indicated that larger diameter nanotubes are more probable
to be formed than smaller diameter nanotubes, regardless of the conformation
(armchair or zigzag); also from an experimental point of view, a highly
controllable synthesis method is required to obtain small-diameter
nanotubes.

Figure S1 illustrates
porous nanotubes,
highlighting the intra-ring and inter-ring bond lengths with additional
comment about the nanotube geometry.

Therefore, even the nanotubes
with the smallest diameter, such
as (2, 2) and (2, 0) nanotubes, showed similar geometries as their
respective surfaces, which were different from what were expected
because the surfaces of nanotubes with small diameters tend to have
a greater degree of geometry distortion.

It is important to
note that despite maintaining the bond length
and bond angles of single layers, rolling up of the nanotube single
layers lead to a small distortion in the pore diameter, particularly
for the smallest nanotubes. For armchair and zigzag PGNTs, the pore
diameters were 3.87 and 3.79 Å, respectively, and for GPNTs,
PBNNTs, and IGP-BNNTs, the pore diameters were 5.47, 3.79, and 5.59
Å for both armchair and zigzag chiralities, respectively. Compared
with our previous work regarding porous surfaces,23 the PGNTs, PBNNTs, and IGP-BNNTs exhibited a small increase
in the pore diameter (3.6, 3.3, and 1.4%, respectively), whereas the
GPNTs had the same diameter. This modification to the pore diameter
could allow some molecules to pass through them, enabling them to
act as a nanofilter for big molecules in which they can be stored
inside the nanotube.

According to the QTAIMAC analysis (summarized
in Table 2 and Figures 6, S4, and S5),
the general description of the B–N bond belongs to the transit
region, neither ionic nor covalent. However, the bond critical points
(BCPs) for both PBNNT and IGP-BNNT are located closer to the boron
atoms, ∼0.49 Å, indicating that the bond is located mostly
around one nuclear attractor. Besides that, the positive values of
the Laplacian and BCP densities around 0.18 e/bohr3 suggest
an ionic nature of the B–N bonds. On the other hand, the very
small value of ellipticity, ε, highlights the cylindrically
symmetric shape of the bonds and confirms the directionality of the
bond. In this sense, because the bond has characteristics of both
bond descriptions, it is considered a transitory type. The transitory
bond character was also observed for porous sheets in previous work,23 and although there was a great structural distortion
when rolling the surface in nanotube, there was no modification in
the type of bond of these systems.

3.2 Electronic
Properties
Analysis of
the band gap and porous nanotube trends, as shown in Figure 3, revealed a smooth increase
in the band gap energy of the PBNNTs (Figure 3a) with the diameter and converged to the
band gap of a single-layer PBN (∼6.45 eV); however, IGP-BNNTs
(Figure 3b) exhibited
a decrease in their band gap as the diameter increased and converged
to ∼5.49 eV, which was also close to the band gap of their
pristine surface (∼5.54 eV). Compared with the BNNTs (∼6.03
eV), the PBNNTs have an increase of ∼7% and the IGP-BNNTs have
a decrease of ∼8% in the band gap, and the bands of both porous
nanotubes are slightly flatter than the BNNTs. For PGNTs (Figure 3c), the band gap
energy increases up to ∼10 Å, after which the band gap
gradually decreased and approached the band gap (∼3.78 eV)
of the single-layer PG. GPNTs (Figure 3d) exhibited a small band gap oscillation as the diameter
increased, converging to a band gap of ∼0.82 eV, which is close
to that of their pristine surface (∼0.85 eV). This effect can
be associated to a higher nanotube structural tension of the smaller
diameter nanotubes, together with the oscillation of the 2py and 2pz orbital contribution.

energy (eV) as a function of the diameter (Å) for
(a) PBNNTs, (b) IGP-BNNTs, (c) PGNTs, and (d) GPNTs.

In comparison with the DFT/PBE results of Koch
et al.,39 the calculated band gap energy
of GPNTs was
quite different. Koch showed that for a particular chirality, GPNTs
have a metallic behavior similar to that for CNTs.43 The difference in results was due to the well-known fact
that the PBE functional underestimates the band gap energy; however,
considering whether the band gap is direct or indirect, our results
were coincident for both chiralities. Also, when compared with a previous
theoretical study40 that utilized the DFTB
methodology, the band gap behaviors for PGNTs and GPNTs were also
in agreement, and the trend observed in the diameter dependence of
the band gap was in reasonable agreement with this work.

To
illustrate the electronic properties, two representative porous
nanotubes, (10, 10) and (10, 0), with diameters of approximately 20
Å were chosen, because of their stabilization of the strain energy.

Figures 4 and 5 show representative band structures and density
of states (DOS) for armchair (10, 10) and zigzag (10, 0) PBNNTs and
IGP-BNNTs; the PGNTs and GPNTs can be seen in Figures S2 and S3 (see Supporting Information).

Figure 4 Band structure and DOS

Figure 5 Band structure and DOS of (a) (10, 10) IGP-BNNT and (b) (10, 0)
IGP-BNNT.

The (10, 10) and (10, 0) PBNNTs
(Figure 4a,b) had band
gap energies of 6.44 and 6.43
eV, respectively, both directing at the Γ point. The (10, 10)
and (10, 0) IGP-BNNTs (Figure 5a,b) had band gaps of 5.53 eV (indirect between the Γ
and ∼X points) and 5.54 eV (direct at the
Γ point), respectively. As a reference, single-layer PBN and
IGP-BN had band gap energies of 6.45 eV (direct at the K point) and 5.52 eV (indirect between the M–K and K points), respectively.

The
DOS of the armchair and zigzag PBNNTs (Figure 4a,b) showed that the main contribution to
the valence band (VB) was from the 2py and 2pz orbitals of the nitrogen atoms,
with an additional small contribution from the 2py and 2pz orbitals of the boron
atoms. The conduction band (CB) displayed the reverse behavior, with
the main contribution close to the band gap region arising from the
2py and 2pz orbitals of the boron atoms, with a minor contribution from the
2py and 2pz orbitals of the nitrogen atoms. There was also a small contribution
from the 1s orbitals of the hydrogen atoms to the conduction and VBs.

For the armchair and zigzag IGP-BNNTs (Figure 5a,b), the main contributions to the valence
and CBs were from the 2py and 2pz orbitals of the nitrogen and boron atoms, respectively.
The 2px orbitals did not contribute around
the band gap of PBNNTs and IGP-BNNTs.

The (10, 10) and (10,
0) PGNTs (Figure S2a,b) had band gap energies
of 3.88 eV (indirect between the Γ
and ∼X points) and 3.95 eV (direct at the
Γ point), respectively. These values were close to the calculated
indirect band gap (3.78 eV) for the PG single-layer surface.

The (10, 10) and (10, 0) GPNTs (Figure S3a,b) had approximately the same band gap energy of 0.83 eV (both direct
at the Γ point), respectively. The calculated nanotube band
gap was very close to that of the GP single-layer surface (direct
band gap energy of 0.83 eV).

Analysis of the DOS of armchair
and zigzag PGNTs (Figure S2a,b) revealed
that the main contribution to the top
of the VB and bottom of the CB arises from the 2py and 2pz orbitals of the carbon
atoms, with a small contribution from the 1s orbital of the hydrogen
atoms. Similarly, the valence and CBs of armchair and zigzag GPNTs
(according to Figure S3a,b) were mainly
contributed to by the 2py and 2pz orbitals of the carbon atoms, and neither PGNTs
nor GPNTs had any contribution from the 2px orbitals around the band gap.

It is important to note that
although hydrogen did not significantly
contribute to the DOS, its small contribution did nevertheless result
in an increase in the band gap energy for all models and chiralities
analyzed; however, for PGNT and GPNT, the band gap energy difference
was much higher than in the others and seemed to be more sensitive
to the hydrogen contribution. The increases in the band gap energy
for these models were around 3.05 eV (367%), and for PBNNT and IGP-BNNT,
around 0.92 eV (∼16%). This large difference may be because
of the chemical nature of the nanotubes consisting of only carbon
(considered organic) compared to those that are considered inorganic
and have a significant gap, as well as from effects arising from the
structural differences in PG-based and IGP-based nanotube pores.

As evident in Figures 4 and 5, both chiralities of the PBNNTs
and IGP-BNNTs were flat around the band gap, indicating that the electrons
had low mobility in this region. For the carbon-based porous nanotubes, Figure S2 shows that the bands of both chiralities
of PGNTs were also flat around the band gap. However, as shown in Figure S3, GPNTs exhibited nonflat bands around
the band gap region, indicating good dispersion and higher electron
mobility, as shown in the respective single-layer structure.

3.3 Elastic and Piezoelectric Properties
An understanding
of the mechanical properties necessary to predict
how the system will react when external forces are applied on the
structure can lead to potential new applications.

As nanotubes
have only one periodic dimension, therefore, there is only one elastic
constant and one piezoelectric constant, namely, C11 and e11, respectively.
Both constants indicate how the nanotube responds to pressure and
electrical response when stress is applied.

The elastic constant C11 is defined
as the second derivative of the energy gradient with respect to the
applied strain ε1, divided by the equilibrium nanotube
volume V, which can be approximated as the surface
area of a one-atom thick cylinder with radius R and
length L 1  

The single-layer elastic constants were calculated
in the same
way as in our previous work,23 and the
same methodology was applied to PBNNTs, IGP-BNNTs, PGNTs, and GPNTs.

The piezoelectric constant e11 is defined
as the first derivative of the polarization (P) with
respect to the strain (μ) over a constant electric field (ϵ),
divided by the equilibrium volume V, which follows
the same configuration as given above 2  

The piezoelectric
behavior can be separated into two types, the
direct piezoelectricity which refers to a change in electric polarization
when some materials are subjected to stresses, and the converse piezoelectricity
which refers to a deformation caused by the application of an electric
field.

To calculate the elastic constant C11, three different diameters were chosen for each chirality,
with n = 10, 20, and 30, giving a total of 24 nanotubes
analyzed
to evaluate the trend. Table 1 summarizes the C11 for both chiralities
of each nanotube. Because of the structural configuration, only zigzag
nanotubes have a piezoelectric response.44,45

To compare the elastic properties with the literature,
it is interesting
to use the Young’s modulus (Y) (often referred
to as the stiffness), as described by Dresselhaus et al.,42 it was calculated using Y = C11 as a first approximation of Young’s
modulus because that a direct comparison can be difficult.

Analysis
of the elastic constants showed that armchair and zigzag
PBNNTs (IGP-BNNTs) had an average Young’s modulus of ∼655
(1083) and ∼520 (1080) GPa, respectively. The PGNTs (GPNTs)
had an average Young’s modulus for armchair and zigzag conformations
of ∼760 (1297) and ∼620 (1295) GPa, respectively. As
a reference, single-layer PBN, IGP-BN, PG, and GP have a Young’s
modulus of ∼348, ∼563, ∼293, and ∼649
GPa, respectively.23

The results
showed that the transition from the single-layer surface
to nanotubes effectively doubled the stiffness of the structures along
the nanotube axis direction. The armchair conformation of PGNTs showed
a slightly higher tolerance to stress along the axis direction than
did the zigzag conformation, although for GPNTs, both nanotube conformations
showed approximately the same stiffness. The experimental value of
the stiffness of typical single-walled carbon nanotubes is 1.25 TPa,46 which is surprisingly close to the values obtained
for the GPNTs, despite the latter having a higher porosity than CNTs,
meanwhile if compared to our calculation for CNTs (∼2.04 TPa)
it is ∼37% smaller. Nevertheless, this indicated that the structure
was highly reinforced upon rolling, suggesting a possible application
as a fiber composite reinforcement.

PBNNTs showed a very similar
behavior to PGNTs in that the armchair
conformation had a higher rigidity along the nanotube axis direction
than did the zigzag conformation. IGP-BNNTs showed only a small variation
in the stiffness for both armchair and zigzag conformations. Single-walled
boron nitride nanotubes (SWBNNTs) have an average elastic modulus
of ∼722 GPa, measured experimentally using the electric field-induced
resonance method inside transmission electron microscopy,47 which is higher than that calculated for PBNNTs
and smaller than IGP-BNNTs; however, if compared with our calculations
for BNNTs (∼1.65 GPa), the latter is ∼34% smaller. This
indicated that both PBNNTs and IGP-BNNTs had a lower rigidity than
SWBNNTs, as they are more deformable in the nanotube axis direction,
but the IGP-BNNTs have the same behavior found for GPNTs as compared
to nonporous nanotubes.

These results indicated that BN-based
porous nanotubes were less
susceptible to deformation along their axis direction compared to
carbon-based nanotubes, as they have a slightly smaller stiffness;
however, both nonhydrogenated porous nanotubes showed a significant
increase in their stiffness compared to their respective single layers.

Additionally, PGNTs and PBNNTs showed a slight dependency of the
elastic constant on the diameter in the zigzag conformation, whereas
GPNTs and IGP-BNNTs did not show any such diameter dependence.

Also, it was observed that porous surfaces did not show any piezoelectric
response, with the exception of PBN, which had very small piezoelectric
constants of 5.46 × 10–5 C/m2 (e11) and −0.10 C/m2 (e21). The rolled-up surfaces maintained nonpiezoelectricity,
with the exception of zigzag PBNNTs, whose piezoelectric constant
does not have any diameter dependence, unlike the behavior observed
for the elastic constants. The average value of the direct piezoelectric
response was 0.44 C/m2, 50% smaller than that for zigzag
BNNTs (without pores) and showed a difference of only +0.10 C/m2 compared to an hBN (0001) surface. Compared to other commonly
used piezoelectric materials such as BaTiO344 and ZnO,45 the piezoelectricity
of PBNNTs was ∼15.3 and ∼2.7 times smaller, respectively.
The converse piezoelectric response was not observed.

One way
to improve the piezoelectricity is to make structural deformations.
For this purpose, strain was applied along the nanotube axis direction
to simulate 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, 25.0, and 30% expansion; the results
are depicted in Table 2. Upon expansion, the piezoelectric constant
increased by ∼7, ∼42, ∼222, ∼1321 and
then starts to drop for ∼963 and 724%, respectively; where
from 15%, the same piezoelectric response than hBN was achieved.

Usually, the equilibrium structure
of the zigzag nanotube has a
natural piezoelectricity; in our particular case, the positive strain
along its periodic direction leads to an increase on the polarizability
and at the same time the improvement of the piezoelectricity. This
increment can be assigned to two factors: first, the broken symmetry
with the loss of its periodicity and second, the increase of the dipole
momentum.

These results indicate that deformations can significantly
alter
the piezoelectric properties, making them a good candidate for electromechanical
devices. Also, it was observed via topological analysis (Table 2) that when expansion
reaches 20%, the nanotube almost reaches the limit of its elastic
behavior, and the B–N bond starts to become a long-range interaction.
When the strain is applied, it was observed that there was a change
in B–N-type bond, the Laplacian value became negative, and
the ratio |V|/G > 2, indicating
that the bond changes from transitory (for zero strain applied) to
covalent (above 5%). Despite the covalent bond, the BCP are closer
to the boron atoms, ∼0.63 Å.

This analysis confirms
that even with the increasing of 20% in
the nanotube length, the B–N bond is almost preserved and the
long-range interaction still maintains the nanotube structure. However,
above 20% strain, the piezoelectric constant starts to drop and the
bonding may break; this understanding can be induced by the vanishing
of the electron density in the BCP, indicating a bond weakening. The
representation of this behavior can be seen in Figure 6, as well as the Laplacian and bond degree behavior over a
strain can be seen in Figures S4 and S5 (see Supporting Information).

Figure 6 Uniaxial strain influence on the piezoelectric response
and electron
density at the BCP for (3, 0) PBNNT.

One way to achieve such a strain is using a nanofilm composed
by
aligned nanotubes deposited over a stretchable substrate and measuring
the relative resistance of the system, as done for CNTs to use as
a strain sensor for human body movement.48

4 Conclusions
The influence of the strain
on the piezoelectric properties of
PBNNTs have been studied by means of periodic method in a DFT/B3LYP(12%)
framework. The positive strain (expansion) on the periodic direction
of the nanotube reveals a significant increase in the piezoelectric
response, showing up an effective means for controlling the piezoelectricity
of the system. The piezoelectricity is increasing until 20% of strain,
after this value, was possible to observe the limit of the expansion
and the fracture of the structure. The elastic analysis showed that
the porous armchair conformation has a higher stiffness than the zigzag
nanotube. The calculated band gap energy is dependent of the diameter,
with most of the structures converging to their respective single-layer
structures. Moreover, for comparison purposes, the properties of porous
carbon nanotubes were also simulated. In particular, the elastic properties
of GPNTs showed similar values to nonporous carbon nanotubes, indicating
that they are suitable for potential applications in the reinforcement
of fiber composites.

The information raised here should be useful
for experimentalists
in the sense to direct their synthesis and analysis with respect to
some specific necessity as well for theoretical scientists which could
explore more properties and applications.

Until the present
moment only the PG and GP surfaces were obtained
experimentally; however, there is no synthesis evidence of both PGNTs
and PBNNTs, but we hope they could be synthetized in the near future.

5 Computational Details
Computational simulations were
performed using a periodic DFT method,
implemented in CRYSTAL1749 software. As
the choice of an appropriate functional that accurately describes
the structural and electronic properties are important, based on previous
work on PG and PBN single-layer structures,23 we used a modified B3LYP (12% hybrid) functional, in which the hybrid
percentage was described as a fraction of mixing of exact Hartree–Fock
(HF) and DFT exchange contributions in the modified functional. The
following equation describes the modified B3LYP functional: Exc = (1 – A)·(ExLDA + 0.9·ExBECKE) + A·ExHF + 0.19·EcLDA + 0.81·EcGGA, where A is the hybrid
percentage (A = 0.12). The carbon, boron, nitrogen,
and hydrogen atoms were described by a TZVP basis set.41

All stationary points were characterized
as minima by diagonalizing
the Hessian matrix with respect to the unit cell parameters and atomic
coordinates. The convergence was checked on the gradient components
and nuclear displacements, with tolerances on their root-mean-squares
set to 0.0001 and 0.0004 a.u., respectively.

The level of accuracy
in evaluating the infinite Coulomb and HF
exchange series was controlled by five αi parameters, with i = 1–5, such that
two-electron contributions were neglected when the overlap between
atomic functions was below 10–αi. The five αi parameters
were set to 10, 10, 10, 20, and 40, and the shrinking factor for the
Pack–Monkhorst and Gilat nets was set to 20.

The DOS
and band structure were analyzed using the same k-point sampling employed for diagonalization of the Fock
matrix in the optimization process.

The electron density was
further analyzed by quantum theory of
atoms in molecules and crystals (QTAIMAC), carried out via TOPOND
program50 incorporated in CRYSTAL17, which
is a theory that provides a quantum description of the probability
of electron density location, therefore, offering important information
on the chemical bonds, cages, rings, and nuclei, which leads to fundamental
understanding of the type interaction between the atoms and the modifications
induced by structural modifications.

The topological properties
were evaluated by analyzing the critical
point of the bonds, which are called BCPs. A critical point (CP) in
the electron density, ρ(r), is a point where the
gradient of the density vanishes (∇ρ(r)
= 0). Each CP can be classified in terms of the eigenvalues, λ1, λ2, and λ3 of the Hessian
matrix; consequently, each CP can be labeled with two indices (r, s) where r is the number
of nonzero eigenvalues values and s is the sum of
the algebraic signs of the eigenvalues. Therefore, in a particular
case of the BCP, (r, s) corresponds
to (3, −1) and indicates a saddle point in the electron density
scalar field, with a local minimum along the interatomic direction
and two maxima in perpendicular directions.

Several quantities
can be evaluated at BCP to define the bond character,
such as electron density, Laplacian (∇2ρ(r)), ratio of potential energy density, and kinetic energy
density (V(r)/G(r)), and the total electronic energy density (H = V(r) + G(r)) which defines the bond degree H/ρ(r). These values can indicate ionic (as hydrogen bond or van
der Waals interactions), covalent, or transitory bond.

Besides
that, the bond shape is described by the ellipticity parameter
(ε), which indicates how and in which direction the density
is mostly polarized. An ε value close to zero indicates a localized
density (which presents a cylindrical shape), characteristic of an
ionic bond or covalent bond in a polar molecule. On the other hand,
ε = ∼1 indicates an elliptical bond shape with a more
“scattered” density between the two attractors.
