We demonstrate the synthesis of a
novel core–satellite-structured
BaTiO3–poly(dopamine)–silver (BT–PDA–Ag)
nanoparticle for improving dielectric properties of nitrile-butadiene
rubber (NBR) nanocomposites. The BT–PDA–Ag nanoparticles
are synthesized by dopamine oxidative polymerization and electroless
plating of silver. The Ag nanoparticles decorated on the BT nanoparticles
enhanced the dielectric constant of NBR nanocomposites due to the
increased conductivity of the filler/matrix interlayer and nanocapacitor
structure. In addition, the incorporation of the BT nanoparticles
prevented the continuous connection of Ag nanoparticles and suppressed
the formation of a conductive path in the NBR matrix. Moreover, the
ultrasmall Ag nanoparticles trapped the carriers by Coulomb blockade
and quantum confinement effects, which results in low dielectric loss
and electrical conductivity of nanocomposites. The proposed method
with simplicity and scalability can be adapted to process high-dielectric
polymer nanocomposites.

1 Introduction
Recently, with the tendency
of miniaturization and multifunctionalization
of electronics, flexible polymer-based materials with tunable properties
have garnered significant research focus.1−3 Particularly,
the polymer nanocomposites with high dielectric constant, low dielectric
loss, high electric breakdown strength, and high energy density are
highly desirable for high-speed integrated circuits.4 A large number of approaches have been adopted to attain
this goal. The most commonly used method is adding either high-dielectric-constant
ceramic fillers, such as BaTiO35,6 and
TiO2,7,8 or conductive fillers, such as
graphene,9,10 carbon nanotubes,11,12 and metallic nanoparticles,13,14 into the polymeric
matrix to synthesize two-phase polymer-based nanocomposites. However,
the high-dielectric-constant ceramic/polymer nanocomposites suffer
from the high concentration of rigid ceramic particles, which induces
agglomeration of nanoparticles and results in poor mechanical properties
and reduced flexibility.15,16 On the other hand,
the incorporation of conductive nanoparticles increases the dielectric
constant by several orders of magnitude when the filler concentration
reaches the percolation threshold.17 However,
the poor compatibility between conductive particles and the polymeric
matrix results in aggregation and formation of numerous local conductive
paths, leading to a high dielectric loss and a low electric breakdown
strength. This hinders the dielectric application of these nanocomposites
in electronic devices.18

To overcome
these problems, a number of studies have been carried
out to prevent the aggregation and form a homogeneous dispersion of
nanoparticles in the polymeric matrix.19,20 One efficient
strategy is the surface functionalization of nanoparticles in the
polymer nanocomposites, which improves the compatibility and homogeneous
dispersion. The surface functionalization can minimize the distortion
degree of the local field and decrease the amount of microstructural
defects, such as voids and flaws at the filler/matrix interface.21 On the basis of this strategy, various surface-modification
agents, such as the coupling agents,22 surfactants,23,24 and phosphoric acids,25,26 have been employed.
Another way of improving nanoparticle dispersion is the “graft
to” and “graft from” method, which directly connects
the nanofillers to the molecular chain of the polymeric matrix by
chemical bonding. Although these techniques improve the dispersion
of nanoparticles to a certain extent, they also have some practical
limitations, such as tedious procedure, complex instrumentation, and
use of toxic solvents.27

Recently,
some research groups have proposed decorating conductive
nanoparticles on high-dielectric-constant ceramic nanoparticles can
avoid the agglomeration without compromising the insulative properties
of the film.28,29 The increased conductivity of
the interlayer between the ceramic nanoparticles and polymeric matrix
by conductive nanoparticles enhances the space charge polarization
and polarization reverse speed, leading to the enhanced dielectric
constant.3,14 In this work, we demonstrate the synthesis
of core–satellite-structured BaTiO3–poly(dopamine)–Ag
(BT–PDA–Ag) nanoparticles by dopamine oxidative polymerization
and electroless plating of silver. The nitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR)
with a relatively high dielectric constant (>10) and a large number
of polar acrylonitrile groups was used as a matrix. The incorporation
of BT nanoparticles prevented the continuous connection of Ag nanoparticles
and suppressed the formation of a conductive path in the NBR matrix.
Moreover, the ultrasmall Ag nanoparticles trapped the carriers by
Coulomb blockade and quantum confinement effects, which resulted in
a low dielectric loss and electrical conductivity.30−33 This research proposes a simple
and effective route to fabricate high-dielectric materials.

2 Results and Discussion
The schematic illustration of
the fabrication of the core–satellite-structured
BT–PDA–Ag nanoparticles is given in Figure 1. First, the BT nanoparticles
were treated with dopamine to form a functional PDA layer, followed
by the decoration of Ag nanoparticles on the PDA shell via in situ
reduction of AgNO3. To date, the dopamine self-polymerization
mechanism is debatable and the research community believes that the
catechol groups oxidize into quinone at weak alkaline pH and form
a key intermediate 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) after a series of oxidation,
cyclization, and rearrangement reactions. The DHI further oxidizes
into 5,6-indolequinone, which undergoes further polymerization to
form PDA. Furthermore, the concurrent presence of the catechol and
amine groups immobilizes the silver nanoparticles onto the BT–PDA
surface.34−36 It is worth mentioning that the [Ag(NH3)2]+ ions are first adsorbed by the catechol
and amine groups on PDA and then reduced into the silver nanoparticles.

Figure 1 Schematic

BT–PDA–Ag nanoparticles and (b) possible mechanism of
dopamine oxidative self-polymerization.

The elemental surface composition of the BT, BT–PDA,
and
BT–PDA–Ag nanoparticles was investigated by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), and results are presented in Figure 2. Figure 2 exhibits that the three types of nanoparticles
demonstrate peaks of C 1s, O 1s, and Ba 3d, but the N 1s peak (binding
energies (BEs) ≈ 400 eV) is observed only in BT–PDA
and BT–PDA–Ag nanoparticles, attributed to the existence
of the nitrogen component in PDA. The N 1s spectra can be deconvoluted
into two peaks at 399.5 and 398.5 eV, which can be assigned to pyridinic
N species (p-N, amine groups) and graphitic N species (g-N, indole
groups), respectively. As we all know, the samples will come in contact
with air inevitably while saving, transporting, and analyzing; therefore,
the C 1s signal in pristine BT particles mainly comes from the contaminant.37 The C 1s region in pristine BT nanoparticles
can be fitted into two peaks located at 284.6 and 286.4 eV, which
are assigned to C–C species and C–O species, respectively.
Two additional peaks with BEs of 285.5 and 288.5 eV in BT–PDA
nanoparticles can be attributed to the C–N and O–C=O
species introduced by PDA, respectively (Figure 2b). These results demonstrate that PDA has
been successfully coated on the surface of BT nanoparticles. In addition,
a strong peak of Ag (BEs ≈ 370 eV) can be seen in Figure 2c. The Ag 3d spectrum
can be deduced from two peak components at BEs of 368.0 and 374.0
eV, for Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 of the metallic
Ag, respectively. No peak corresponding to the silver oxide species
is found in the XPS spectrum, which indicates the successful reduction
of Ag+ to Ag0, using glucose as a reducing agent
in the presence of PDA.

spectra of
(a) BT and (b) BT–PDA and (c) XPS wide-scan and Ag 3d core-level
spectra of BT–PDA–Ag particles.

Figure 3 shows
the
X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum of BT, BT–PDA, and BT–PDA–Ag
nanoparticles. As shown in Figure 3, the XRD pattern of BT nanoparticles exhibits the
typical cubic lattice system. After functionalization with PDA, the
XRD patterns of BT and BT–PDA nanoparticles exhibit no difference,
indicating that PDA has no effect on the crystal structure of BT nanoparticles
and the PDA layer is amorphous. The BT–PDA–Ag nanoparticles
show four sharp characteristic peaks of silver (2θ = 38.2, 44.4,
64.6, and 77.4°), corresponding to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2
0), and (3 1 1) planes of face-centered cubic silver, respectively.
The XRD pattern is consistent with the JCPDS card no. 4-783.

nanoparticles.

Figure 4 shows the
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images of
BT, BT–PDA, and BT–PDA–Ag nanoparticles. On comparing
with pristine BT nanoparticles that exhibit a smooth surface (shown
in Figure 4a), the
BT–PDA nanoparticles display a distinct rough PDA layer with
a thickness of 2 nm, which is coated on the surface of BT nanoparticles
(shown in Figure 4b).
From Figure 4c, it
can be seen that some silver nanoparticles (with an average diameter
of 10 nm) without a continuous silver layer are dotted on the PDA
layer.

nanoparticles.

The morphology of BT
and BT–PDA–Ag nanoparticles
was also observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the result
is presented in Figure 5. In Figure 5a, the
smooth surface of the pristine BT nanoparticles can be readily observed.
After the decoration process, the Ag nanoparticles with an average
diameter of about 10 nm were individually distributed on the surface
of BT–PDA nanoparticles (shown in Figure 5b). The electronic probe microanalyzer was
used to investigate the chemical composition of BT–PDA–Ag
nanoparticles, and the results showed that the silver content is about
13.5 wt %. In addition, the electrical conductivity of BT–PDA–Ag
nanoparticles determined by Keysight B2902 Precision Source/Measure
Units was about 1.5 × 10–7 S/m.

and (b) BT–PDA–Ag nanoparticles.

Figure 6 presents
the freeze-fractured cross-sectional SEM images of the NBR composite
films filled with different contents of fillers. Small agglomerated
particles were observed in the 10 phr BT/NBR nanocomposite, and the
size of the agglomeration increased with the increasing BT nanoparticle
content, which led to the formation of the filler network in the 50
phr BT/NBR nanocomposite. This can be attributed to the large difference
in surface energy between BT nanoparticles and the NBR matrix. While
comparing BT/NBR nanocomposites with BT–PDA–Ag/NBR nanocomposites,
it can be easily observed that the later displays more homogenous
distribution with limited agglomeration of nanoparticles. In addition,
the interface between BT–PDA–Ag nanoparticles and the
matrix is indistinguishable, suggesting the enhanced interface compatibility
of BT–PDA–Ag/NBR nanocomposites due to the strong adhesion
properties of PDA. More importantly, the high-magnification SEM images
reveal that the Ag nanoparticles are still tightly stuck to the BT
nanoparticles after strong shearing stress during mixing, suggesting
strong adhesion between the Ag nanoparticles and the BT core.

of the NBR composites filled with (a) 10 phr BT, (b)
10 phr BT–PDA–Ag, (c) 30 phr BT, (d) 30 phr BT–PDA–Ag,
(e) 50 phr BT, and (f) 50 phr BT–PDA–Ag nanoparticles.

The mechanical properties of the
NBR composites have been studied,
and the stress–strain curves are presented in Figure 7. As shown in Figure 7, the tensile strength of NBR
nanocomposites increased with the increasing filler loading content,
indicating the reinforcement effect of inorganic nanoparticles. When
compared with BT/NBR nanocomposites, the BT–PDA–Ag/NBR
nanocomposites displayed a higher tensile strength at the same filler
content due to the uniform dispersion of nanoparticles and strong
interfacial interaction. Usually, the loading of inorganic ceramics
will decrease the flexibility of the polymeric matrix due to the interfacial
defects, such as voids and air bubbles. However, the enhanced interfacial
interaction between two phases can restrict the chain slippage and
orient the stretching chains to uniformly distribute the external
force.38 The highest tensile strength was
achieved for the 50 phr BT–PDA–Ag/NBR nanocomposite
and reached up to 2.91 MPa, which is about 1.79 times higher than
that of pure NBR. Moreover, the elongation at break of BT–PDA–Ag/NBR
nanocomposites was also higher as compared to that of BT/NBR nanocomposites
at the same filler loading. The larger elongation at break can be
ascribed to the improved interfacial interactions between BT–PDA–Ag
nanoparticles and the NBR matrix, which prevents the inevitable elongation
losses.39 However, the NBR composite loading
with 10 phr BT or BT–PDA–Ag nanoparticles exhibits a
larger elongation at break as compared with the pure NBR, which can
be ascribed to the decreased cross-link density due to the interference
of BT nanoparticles on the cross-linking process.27

Figure 7 Stress–strain curves of the NBR composites filled with different
contents of (a) BT and (b) BT–PDA–Ag nanoparticles.

The dependence of the dielectric
constant of pure NBR, BT/NBR,
and BT–PDA–Ag/NBR nanocomposites on frequency is displayed
in Figure 8. From Figure 8, we can find that
the dielectric constant and dielectric loss tangent of all samples
decrease with the increasing frequency, meaning that the dielectric
properties are strongly frequency-dependent. This phenomenon is responsible
for the dipole polarization of −CN in NBR and interfacial polarization
between the filler and matrix, which cannot catch up with the changing
electrical field frequency. Compared with that of pure NBR, the dielectric
constant of BT/NBR composites increased with an increase in the filler
content and can be attributed to the interfacial polarization, namely,
the Maxwell–Wagner–Sillars effect.14 Furthermore, the BT–PDA–Ag/NBR nanocomposites
containing a large amount of filler (30 or 50 phr) exhibit a larger
dielectric constant at low frequency, when compared to BT/NBR nanocomposites
filled with the same filler content. For instance, the 50 phr BT–PDA–Ag/NBR
nanocomposite showed the dielectric constant of 21.5 at 1 Hz, whereas
the 50 phr BT/NBR nanocomposite has a lower dielectric constant of
13.52 at 1 Hz (shown in Table 1). The higher dielectric constant can be attributed to the
introduction of Ag nanoparticles. The Ag nanoparticles enhance the
conductivity of the interlayer between the filler and the polymeric
matrix, which increases the space charge polarization and polarization
reverse speed and results in a higher dielectric constant.3,14 Moreover, the core–satellite-structured BT–PDA–Ag
nanoparticles can be considered as a nanocapacitor structure in a
polymeric matrix, where two neighboring BT–PDA–Ag nanoparticles
act as the electrode and the thin NBR layer acts as the dielectric.16 Although some nanoparticle clusters might exist
in the matrix, there was no obvious influence on dielectric properties
of the film. However, it is seen from Table 1 that the dielectric constant at 1 Hz of
10 phr BT/NBR is higher than that of 10 phr BT–PDA–Ag/NBR.
The lower dielectric constant of 10 phr BT–PDA–Ag/NBR
demonstrating the introduction of a little amount of Ag nanoparticles
affected the dielectric constant of NBR composites. This phenomenon
can be explained by the Coulomb blockade effect of ultrasmall Ag nanoparticles
on the surface of BT, which prevents the electron migration and suppresses
the space charge accumulation in the interface, resulting in a lower
dielectric constant.32

constant of pure NBR and NBR nanocomposites

nanoparticles on frequency at room temperature.

Figure 9a,b depicts
the alternating current (AC) electrical conductivity and dielectric
loss tangent of the pure NBR, BT/NBR, and BT–PDA–Ag/NBR
nanocomposites, respectively. As expected, the AC electrical conductivity
of nanocomposites increases with an increase in the loading content
of BT–PDA–Ag nanoparticles (Figure 9a). For instance, the AC electrical conductivity
increased from 1.76 × 10–12 S/m for pure NBR
to 2.34 × 10–11 S/m for the 50 phr BT–PDA–Ag/NBR
nanocomposite. The small decrease in the electrical conductivity of
BT–PDA–Ag/NBR nanocomposites indicates the insulation
of the resulting film and confirms that no conducting path has been
formed in the nanocomposites. The core–satellite structure
suppresses the “percolation” of Ag nanoparticles, resulting
in a steady increase in the dielectric constant of NBR composites.

Figure 9 Dependence
of (a) AC electrical conductivity and (b) dielectric
loss tangent of pure NBR and NBR nanocomposites filled with different
contents of BT–PDA–Ag nanoparticles on frequency at
room temperature.

Figure 9b presents
the dielectric loss of the nanocomposites and indicates a smaller
loss at a higher frequency. It is well known that the interfacial
polarizations and ion conductivity are mainly responsible for the
dielectric behavior of the material at low frequency, whereas dipole
polarization is responsible for the dielectric response at high frequency.40 In addition, the dielectric loss of nanocomposites
increased with the increasing content of BT–PDA–Ag nanoparticles
at low frequency, which can be attributed to the increased electrical
conductivity.4 However, the BT–PDA–Ag
nanoparticles assist in decreasing the dielectric loss in certain
content at high frequency, which can be ascribed to the Coulomb blockade
and quantum confinement effects of ultrasmall Ag nanoparticles.40,41 Finally, the highest dielectric loss was about 1.6 at 1 Hz for the
50 phr BT–PDA–Ag/NBR nanocomposite. The relatively low
dielectric loss is achieved and corresponds to blockage of charge
carrier movement by insulating NBR chains.3

The effect of temperature on the dielectric constant was measured
at a constant frequency of 1 Hz, and results are shown in Figure 10a. The dielectric
constant varies with the increasing temperature, and the highest dielectric
constant was observed at 10 °C. The change in dielectric constant
with respect to temperature is due to the competing effect between
mobility and thermal expansion of the nanocomposites.42 When the temperature is increased from −50 to 10
°C, the interfacial interaction restricts the thermal expansion
and the formation of interspace, whereas the thermal expansion is
fully exhibited when the temperature is greater than 10 °C. Because
of the large difference in thermal expansion coefficient between the
BT–PDA–Ag filler and the NBR matrix, the thermal expansion
might overcome the effect of polymer mobility on the dielectric constant
at high temperature. Therefore, after reaching a maximum value at
10 °C, the dielectric constant decreases with an increase in
temperature.

of the pure
NBR and NBR nanocomposites filled with different contents of BT–PDA–Ag
nanoparticles in the temperature range of −50 to 90 °C
and (b) frequency dependence of the dielectric loss tangent of the
NBR composite filled with 50 phr BT–PDA–Ag nanoparticles
in the temperature range of −50 to 50 °C.

Figure 10b displays
the frequency dependence of the dielectric loss tangent for the 50
phr BT–PDA–Ag/NBR nanocomposite at different temperatures.
It can be easily observed that the frequency dependence is also affected
by the temperature. At high temperature, the change in dielectric
constant with respect to frequency is more significant, which can
be due to the dominant polar relaxation at high temperature. On the
other hand, the anomalous characteristic of the glass-transition temperature
(Tg) of the polymer dictates the dielectric
behavior of nanocomposites at low temperatures.

Figure 11 shows
the direct current (DC) volume resistivity and electric breakdown
strength of the pure NBR, BT/NBR, and BT–PDA–Ag/NBR
nanocomposites filled with different amounts of filler loading. It
is easily observed from Figure 11a that the volume resistivity of BT/NBR nanocomposites
does not significantly change with loading of BT nanoparticles. However,
the volume resistivity of BT–PDA–Ag/NBR nanocomposites
decreases with an increase in BT–PDA–Ag nanoparticle
content, which is consistent with the AC electrical conductivity.
In addition, the nanoparticles enhance the electric breakdown strength
(shown in Figure 11b) when the filler content increases to 30 phr. This can be explained
by the decrease in the mobility of polymer chains when they are tightly
bonded to the nanoparticles. The transfer of charge carriers through
loose polymer chains not bonded to the nanoparticles is blocked, which
results in a higher electrical breakdown strength.43−45 For simple
linear response dielectric materials, the maximum energy density can
simply be defined as Ue = 1/2εrε0Eb2, where εr is the relative dielectric permittivity
(dielectric constant), ε0 is the vacuum dielectric
permittivity with the value of 8.85 × 10–12 F/m, and Eb is the dielectric breakdown
strength.39 Compared with BT/NBR nanocomposites,
the BT–PDA–Ag/NBR nanocomposites exhibited lower electric
breakdown strength, which is attributed to the lower volume resistivity.
However, a high energy density was achieved due to the high dielectric
constant of BT–PDA–Ag/NBR nanocomposites (Table 1), which is a big advantage
for the dielectric materials.

strength of the NBR
nanocomposites filled with different contents of BT and BT–PDA–Ag

3 Conclusions
We demonstrate the synthesis of core–satellite-structured
BT–PDA–Ag nanoparticles by dopamine oxidative polymerization
and electroless plating of silver. The decoration of Ag nanoparticles
on the surface of BT nanoparticles resulted in a higher dielectric
constant, which can be attributed to the increased conductivity of
the filler/matrix interlayer and nanocapacitor structure. Moreover,
the BT–PDA–Ag/NBR nanocomposites exhibited low dielectric
loss and electrical conductivity, resulting from the introduction
of BT nanoparticles, which prevented the continuous connection of
Ag nanoparticles and suppressed the formation of a conductive path
in the NBR matrix. The proposed method with simplicity and scalability
could provide a promising route for improving dielectric properties
of polymer nanocomposites.

4 Methods
4.1 Materials
The BT nanoparticles with
an average diameter of 100 nm were obtained from Nantong New Electronic
Technology Company, China. Dopamine (DA) hydrochloride, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane
(Tris), poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), silver nitrate (AgNO3), glucose, ammonia, and dicumyl peroxide (DCP) were obtained from
Aladdin Industrial Plant, China. The NBR, with an acrylonitrile content
of 28 wt % (DN2850), was received from Zeon Corporation, Japan.

4.2 Dopamine Oxidative Polymerization on BT Nanoparticle
Surface
In a typical process, 80 g of BT nanoparticles, 2
g of dopamine hydrochloride, and 1.2 g of Tris were dispersed into
1000 mL of distilled water (pH = 8.5) and stirred for 24 h at room
temperature. Then, the obtained nanoparticles were collected by filtration
and washed three times using deionized water. The filter material
was a commercial medium-speed qualitative filter paper with 100% cotton
cellulose and of type 102, which was supplied by Hangzhou Special
Paper Industry Co., Ltd. The nanoparticles were dried in a vacuum
oven at 60 °C for 12 h and referred as BT–PDA in this
article.

4.3 Electroless Plating of Silver Nanoparticles
on BT–PDA Surface
The silver plating bath was prepared
as follows. The AgNO3 solution with a concentration of
30 g/L was prepared, and ammonia was slowly dropped into the above
solution until it became transparent again. Then, 0.5 wt % PVP was
mixed into the above mixture and the reaction mixture was continuously
stirred until the complete dissolution of PVP. Then, the BT–PDA
nanoparticles were dispersed into the silver plating bath, followed
by ultrasonic treatment for 30 min. Glucose with a concentration two
times that of AgNO3 was dropwise added to the above mixture,
and the reaction mixture was continuously stirred for 60 min at room
temperature. The obtained BT–PDA–Ag nanoparticles were
collected by filtration with distilled water and dried in a vacuum
oven at 60 °C for 24 h.

4.4 Preparation of NBR Dielectric
Composites
First, different amounts (0–50 g) of BT
or BT–PDA–Ag
nanoparticles, 2 g of DCP, and 100 g of NBR were mixed in a 6 in.
two-roll mill. Then, the mixture was poured into a mold and cured
at 25 MPa and 160 °C for the optimum curing time (t90) to obtain cured composites. The t90 was obtained from a GT-M2000-FA rotorless curemeter
(Goteah Testing Machines Inc., Taiwan) at 160 °C.

4.5 Characterization Method
X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were
measured by a Bruker D8 Focus diffractometer. High-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HR-TEM) was performed to observe the morphologies
of the particles using Hitachi H9000 at a voltage of 300 kV. Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out using Nova NanoSEM 430,
FEI SEM. An electronic probe microanalyzer (EPMA-1600; Shimadzu, Japan)
was used with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. Tensile tests of dumbbell-shaped
samples were carried out using a tensile apparatus (Instron 3366,
Instron Corporation, American) at a cross-head speed of 50 mm/min,
according to ASTM D412. The stress of all samples is engineering stress.
The electrical and dielectric responses were measured using a Novochtrol
Alpha-A broadband dielectric spectrometer in the frequency range of
10–106 Hz at various temperatures. The DC breakdown
strength was assessed by an LAS6030P electrical breakdown strength
tester at room temperature with an increasing voltage rate of 800
V/s, which was supplied by Boher High Voltage Power Supplies Co. Ltd,
China. The samples were performed using circular membrane actuators
in the presence of air for considering practical application of dielectric
materials, according to our previous works.27 The volumetric resistivity (ρν) was calculated
using an EST 121 resistivity meter (Beijing Huajinghui, China).
