Four CeO2 samples were
prepared by pyrolysis of cerium
hydroxide, cerium nitrate, cerium oxalate, and cerium perchlorate.
The structures of CeO2 samples were characterized by means
of X-ray diffraction and nitrogen adsorption–desorption. Temperature-programmed
reduction and thermogravimetry tests were carried out to evaluate
the reduction and sulfurization behaviors of the CeO2 samples.
The results indicate that the samples, prepared from different precursors,
have larger surface areas and pore specific volumes, smaller average
crystallite sizes, and better reducibilities (except the sample from
cerium perchlorate) than the CeO2 reagent. The sulfurization
performances of CeO2 samples are directly correlated with
the reduction degrees of CeO2 samples. Compared with fresh
CeO2 samples, reduced ones have better sulfurization performances.
Among the four CeO2 samples, the one prepared from cerium
nitrate, with the best reducibility, exhibits the best performance
in sulfurization.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Hot gas desulfurization
of coal-derived fuel gases is an essential
process in emerging power generation technologies, such as the integrated
gasification combined cycle and the coal-based polygeneration system
(an advance technology for clean and efficient utilization of coal
with the advantages of low cost, high efficiency, and environmental
friendliness). Cerium oxide based sorbents have been developed in
recent years for the removal of H2S from coal-derived gas
and natural gas and SOx from flue gas.
CeO2 shows very good promise. There are several advantages
of cerium oxide based sorbents including their usability at high temperature
(>700 °C), the favorable sulfurization equilibrium in reducing
gas environments, and the potential to be regenerated via a route
that directly produces elemental sulfur, which reduces the complexity
of the regeneration step.1−10

In the work of Zhang et al.11 the
kinetics
of reaction between CeO2 and SO2 was affected
by the preparation method of CeO2. The precursors of cerium
oxides can result in different CeO2 microlitic structures
and then influence both the reduction and the sulfurization of CeO2. However, there are very few studies on either the structure
or the surface properties of the cerium oxide samples from different
precursors or their effect on desulfurization in hot gas.

In
this study, cerium oxide samples were prepared by pyrolysis
of cerium hydroxide, cerium nitrate, cerium oxalate, and cerium perchlorate.
Nitrogen adsorption–desorption (BET) and X-ray diffraction
(XRD) were conducted to characterize the structural properties of
the cerium oxide samples prepared from different precursors. Temperature-programmed
reduction (TPR) and thermogravimetric (TG) tests were carried out
to investigate their reduction and sulfurization behavior, respectively.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of the
Prepared CeO2 Samples
The surface areas, pore
specific volumes, and pore
size distributions of the prepared CeO2 samples and chemical
reagent CeO2 were measured by nitrogen adsorption and desorption.
The characteristic results of all samples are shown in Table 1.

Table 1 BET Surface
Areas, Pore Specific Volumes,
and Pore Diameter Distributions of CeO2 Samples

chemical reagent	35.10	0.082	16.84	63.16	5.12	14.88	
from cerium hydroxide	40.57	0.116	3.32	52.49	29.20	14.99	
from cerium nitrate	60.15	0.208	2.89	70.95	11.40	14.76	
from cerium oxalate	101.91	0.110	48.62	26.34	5.38	19.66	
from cerium perchlorate	45.93	0.104	10.17	61.68	11.36	16.79	
It can
be seen that the surface areas and pore specific volumes
of all the prepared CeO2 samples are larger than those
of the CeO2 reagent. The sample of cerium oxalate with
the largest fraction of micropores (R < 20 Å)
has the largest BET surface area (101.91 m2/g). The sample
from cerium nitrate has the largest pore specific volume (0.208 cm3/g) with most of the pores in the range of 20–200 Å.
All the samples prepared in this work were identified by XRD, and
the results are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of the CeO2 reagent and samples
from different
precursors.

The crystallite sizes
of CeO2 samples were estimated
by the half-height width of diffraction peaks,12 and the results are shown in Table 2.

CeO2 prepared

CeO2 crystallized in the face-centered cubic system
has a characteristic fluorite oxide type structure. The diffraction
pattern of CeO2 from Ce2(C2O4)3 is broader than those of the other samples,
indicating a small crystallite size of the oxide phase. The prepared
CeO2 samples, except the one from Ce(ClO4)3, have smaller average crystallite sizes than the CeO2 reagent. The average particle size of CeO2 from
Ce2(C2O4)3 is 7.1 nm,
and it grows to 10.9 and 13.4 nm in the sample from Ce(NO3)3 and Ce(OH)3, respectively.

2.2 TPR Tests of the Prepared CeO2 Samples
TPR
tests were performed from 200 to 850 °C in the gases of
40 vol % H2/N2 at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
The H2-TPR profiles of the prepared CeO2 samples
and chemical reagent CeO2 are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 TPR profiles of the chemical
reagent and the CeO2 samples
prepared (1% H2S, 40% H2, N2 balance;
sample size: 180–200 mesh; sample weight: 100 ± 1 mg).

Appreciable reduction capacity
can be found at temperatures above
400 °C. A large and broad reduction peak in the temperature range
of 400–550 °C and a shoulder around 580 °C appear
for all samples in the TPR profiles of CeO2. The main and
shoulder peaks correspond to the reduction of surface oxygen and bulk
oxygen, respectively.13 Compared with the
CeO2 reagent, the prepared CeO2 samples have
larger main peak areas except the CeO2 sample from Ce(ClO4)3. It indicates that the amount of surface oxygen
in these prepared samples is more than that in the CeO2 reagent. The surface oxygen change of the structure, as revealed
by BET and XRD studies, could contribute to this change of reduction
patterns. As shown in Table 2, the reduction peak areas of the CeO2 samples
from Ce(NO3)3, Ce(OH)3, and Ce2(C2O4)3 are about 94, 46,
and 3% larger than that of the CeO2 reagent, respectively.
It indicates that these CeO2 samples have better reducibility
than the CeO2 reagent, especially the one from Ce(NO3)3.

2.3 Sulfurization Tests of
the Prepared CeO2 Samples
Sulfurization experiments
of the CeO2 samples were performed in the TG apparatus
at 700 °C.
In this experiment, a ceramic crucible containing 10 mg of the sample
was placed on the platinum pan suspended from a thin quartz rod attached
to one arm of the microbalance, and then the apparatus was purged
by N2 carrier gas for cleaning the air in it. The reactor
system containing a sorbent was heated from room temperature up to
700 °C in nitrogen at a rate of 10 °C/min, and then the
reducing gas containing H2S was introduced. The sulfurization
experimental results are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 TG curves of prepared CeO2 samples
in the process of
sulfurization (T = 700 °C, 1% H2S,
40% H2, N2 balance; sample size: 180–200
mesh; sample weight: 10 ± 0.1 mg).

According to the phase stability diagrams for the Ce–O–S
system, Ce2O3 can be produced from ceria (reaction 1) in a very reducing
atmosphere, and cerium oxysulfide and cerous sulfide can be derived
from both cerium(IV) oxide (reactions 2 and 3) and cerium(III) oxide
(reactions 4 and 5), respectively.14−17

The reduction reaction
equation of cerium(IV) oxide is 1  Sulfurization reaction equations
of cerium oxide are 2   3   4   5  Cerium oxide in its higher
oxidation state (+4) has low sulfurization equilibria; however, the
reduced oxide Ce2O3 is a superior sorbent to
remove H2S.18,19

As shown in Figure 3, a slight weight loss is initially
observed followed by a rapid
weight gain at about 10 min, and afterward, the weight gain proceeds
but at a gentle pace. It should be noted that reduction and sulfurization
both contributed to the weight change.20,21

At the
beginning time of the experimental process, a slight weight
loss indicates that the reduction rate is a bit faster than the sulfurization
rate. The rapid weight increase shows the high sulfurization rate
due to the increase of reduced cerium oxide. It is not possible to
specify the sulfurization products of ceria from the weight increase
due to the combination of reactions 3–5. However, at the given
reaction conditions, the most plausible reactant on the basis of thermodynamics
is Ce2O3, not CeO2. Thus, the stable
sulfurization product is considered to be Ce2S3 on the basis of the phase diagram.14,17

Figures 4 and 5 show the profiles of estimated sulfurization conversion
of fresh and reduced CeO2 samples in the same sulfurization
conditions. The conversion Xs was calculated
assuming formation of Ce2S3. As shown in Figure 4, combining the effects
of reduction and sulfurization, the value of Xs increases rapidly after about 5 min of reaction, achieving
about 81, 79, and 69% for CeO2 samples from Ce(NO3)3, Ce(OH)3, and Ce(ClO4)3, respectively, at the latter 10 min of reaction. However, the rapid
increase of Xs for the CeO2 sample from Ce2(C2O4)3 begins at 10 min of reaction, and the conversion Xs achieves only 58% at 20 min of reaction.

Figure 4 Estimated conversion
of CeO2 to Ce2S3 of the fresh CeO2 samples in the process of sulfurization
(T = 700 °C, 1% H2S, 40% H2, N2 balance).

Figure 5 Estimated conversion of CeO2 to Ce2S3 of the reduced CeO2 samples in the process of
sulfurization (T = 700 °C, 1% H2S,
40% H2, N2 balance).

As shown in Figure 5, Xs of the reduced CeO2 samples
(after 30 min pre-reduction in 40% H2/N2 reductant
gas) enhanced, especially for the CeO2 sample from Ce2(C2O4)3. The value of Xs increases rapidly in the first 10 min, achieving
about 92, 87, 83, and 73% for CeO2 samples from Ce(NO3)3, Ce(OH)3, Ce(ClO4)3, and Ce2(C2O4)3, respectively. Xs of the reduced CeO2 samples, except the sample from Ce(ClO4)3, is above 90% after 20 min of reaction. Xs of the CeO2 sample from Ce2(C2O4)3 improves greatly from 58 (without pre-reduction)
to 91% (with pre-reduction) at 20 min of sulfurization.

From Figures 4 and 5 and Table 2, it can be seen that the sulfurization performance is directly
correlated with the reduction degree of CeO2 samples. The
CeO2 sample from cerium nitrate, with the largest TPR reduction
peak area, exhibits the best behavior in sulfurization among the four
prepared CeO2 samples.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, CeO2 samples were prepared by pyrolysis
of cerium hydroxide, cerium nitrate, cerium oxalate, and cerium perchlorate.
To evaluate the effects of different preparation methods on the structure
and the reactivity of CeO2 samples, XRD and BET techniques
were used to characterize the structural properties, and the tests
of H2-TPR and TG were carried out to investigate the reduction
and sulfurization, respectively. It is found that the microlitic structures
of CeO2 samples are different obviously, which influences
the reduction and sulfurization performances of CeO2 samples.
The prepared CeO2 samples, except the sample from Ce(ClO4)3, have better reduction performances than the
CeO2 reagent. The sulfurization performances of CeO2 samples are directly correlated with the reduction degree
of CeO2 samples. Compared with fresh CeO2 samples,
reduced ones have better sulfurization performances. The CeO2 sample from cerium nitrate, with the largest TPR reduction peak
area, exhibits the best behavior in sulfurization.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of Cerium Oxide
Samples
Four cerium oxide samples were prepared by pyrolysis
of cerium hydroxide,
cerium nitrate, cerium oxalate, and cerium perchlorate. The raw materials
were A. R. grade chemical agent Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (purity 99.95%). Cerium hydroxide, cerium oxalate, and cerium
perchlorate were prepared by precipitation. First, cerium nitrate
was dissolved in deionized water. Oxalic acid and perchloric acid
were then added to prepare cerium oxalate and cerium perchlorate,
respectively. Ammonia water was added to prepare cerium hydroxide.
Each solution was subjected to the precipitation reaction, and the
solution in the flask was continuously stirred with a magnetic stirrer
on a hot plate so that the solution was kept at 60–70 °C.
The precipitate was then filtered, washed in deionized water twice,
dried at 110 °C, and crushed to a powder before pyrolysis. Cerium
hydroxide, cerium oxalate, cerium nitrate, and cerium perchlorate
were pyrolyzed in a muffle furnace at 340 °C for 15 h, 300 °C
for 20 h, 340 °C for 15 h, and 260 °C for 10 h, respectively.

4.2 Characterization of Cerium Oxide Samples
Specific surface areas and the pore size distributions of the prepared
samples were determined by nitrogen adsorption and desorption using
a BET instrument (CE Sorptomatic 1990, Italy). The crystal structure
was determined from the diffraction pattern obtained with an X-ray
diffractometer (Rigaku D/max-2500, Japan).

4.3 TPR and
TG Tests of Cerium Oxide Samples
Temperature-programmed reduction
(TPR) tests were performed using
a TP-5000-II adsorber manufactured by Tianjin Xianquan Co. Ltd., China.
A 40% H2/N2 gas mixture was used as the reductant
gas. The cerium oxide sample powder of 100 mg and 180–200 mesh
was placed in a quartz tube reactor and surrounded with quartz chips.
The sample was first heated in N2 gas flow at 200 °C
for 2 h to remove the adsorbed gases, and then TPR was carried out
under H2/N2 flow at a heating rate of 10 °C/min
up to 850 °C. All gases were of analytical grade (H2, N2 from cylinder and with purity of 99.99%).

The
TG tests were conducted in a thermogravimetric analysis apparatus
manufactured by the Netzsch Company, Germany. A gas flow rate of 200
mL/min and a sample powder of 180–200 mesh were used to prevent
or minimize the gas-phase mass-transfer resistance and the effects
of pore diffusion. In a TG test run, 10 mg of cerium oxide sample
powder was uniformly spread on a circular pan. Before starting the
experiment, pure nitrogen was introduced to replace the oxygen atmosphere,
and the sample was heated from ambient temperature to 700 °C.
Then the isothermal experiments were carried out to study the sulfurization
with and without pre-reduction in a gaseous mixture consisting of
1% H2S, 40% H2, and nitrogen balance. All these
gases are stored in cylinders, and their purity reach 99.99%.
