The use of liquid sulfur dioxide
as a reaction solvent to promote
chemical transformations of alkynes has been explored. First, a combination
of liquid SO2 and In(OTf)3 or Hf(OTf)4 as a catalyst allows to perform hydration of aryl alkynes under
mild conditions without a direct addition of Brønsted acid. Second,
novel catalyst-free conditions for the synthesis of α-vinyl
iodides, bromides, and chlorides from aryl alkynes have been developed
in liquid SO2 using group I and II metal halides and ammonium
iodide as the halide ion sources.

Introduction
Alkyne hydration is
an atom-efficient strategy toward carbonyl
compounds.1−3 Traditionally, the synthesis of ketones by Markovnikov
addition of water to the C≡C bond is carried out using stoichiometric
amount of toxic Hg(II) salts under strongly acidic conditions.4 A great number of alternative hydration conditions,
including transition-metal catalysis, have been developed over the
past decades.1−3,5−12 Also, several metal-free systems based on the combination of strong
protic acid (e.g., TsOH or TfOH) with weakly acidic and hydrogen-bond-forming
reaction medium have been reported.13,14 Recently,
several procedures for metal triflate-catalyzed alkyne hydration have
been established revealing contributory effect of triflate ion on
the Lewis acid properties of the corresponding metal ion and its ability
to activate the C≡C bond. In 2013, Gao et al. developed In(III)
triflate-catalyzed hydration of both terminal and internal alkynes
in the presence of catalytic amount of p-TsOH in
1,2-dichloroethene.15 After 3 years, Zeng
et al. employed the same catalyst for hydration of 1-haloalkynes in
acetic acid.16 A similar substrate scope
was examined for Ga(III) triflate-catalyzed reaction in acetic acid
by Liang et al. in 2015,17 while a combination
of Cu(II) triflate and acetic acid published by Jha group in 2014
is applicable only for aryl acetylenes.18 To the best of our knowledge, there are only two reports that describe
triflate-catalyzed alkyne hydration in the absence of Brønsted
acid additive. These reactions are carried out in ethyl acetate at
elevated temperatures in the presence of Cu(II)19 or Ag(I)20 triflate as a catalyst.
The latter is effective only for terminal alkynes. Besides employing
these Brønsted acid-free protocols, catalyst loading has to be
increased to 10–20 mol % instead of 0.2–2.5 mol % used
in the methods mentioned previously.

Also, vinyl halides are
versatile intermediates in organic synthesis,
especially as substrates for the transition metal-catalyzed C–C
cross-coupling reactions. Hydrohalogenation of alkynes is one of the
easiest ways to obtain these valuable compounds.21 The hydrohalogenation regioselectivity of a terminal C≡C
bond mainly depends on the choice of reagents. As the direct addition
of HX (X = I, Br or Cl) to the alkyne is nonselective and often leads
to low yield and undesirable side reactions, various multicomponent
reagent systems have been developed to obtain one regioisomer, exclusively.
Highly regioselective methods for the synthesis of α-vinyl bromides
and iodides from terminal alkynes include alkyne haloboration22 or Ni(II)-catalyzed hydroalumination23 and subsequent acidic workup or addition of
halonium source, respectively. Another strategy is in situ generation of HX (X = I, Br) employing following combinations of
reagents: trimethylsilyl iodide/H2O,24 trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl)/NaI/H2O,25 TMSCl/LiBr/tetraethylammonium bromide,26 CuO·HBF4/I2/Et3SiH,27 and BI3/N,N-diethylanaline.28 Recently, Kawaguchi et al. have published a method for
the synthesis of α-vinyl iodides using iodine and Ph2P(O)H.29 The latter reduces iodine as
well as serves as a proton source. Later, they made an improvement
by replacing Ph2P(O)H with PPh3 and water.30 This modification allowed to perform a sequential
C–C cross-coupling reaction in the same pot. Another recently
published approach toward the α-vinyl iodides from terminal
alkynes is a CeCl3·7H2O-catalyzed hydroiodination
employing NaI as the iodide ion source.31 Although highly regioselective, most of these methods are not atom-efficient
and lead to a high amount of both organic and inorganic wastes. In
contrast, selective synthesis of α-vinyl chlorides from monosubstituted
acetylenes is poorly studied. The latest examples include direct Markovnikov
addition of HCl to the alkynes catalyzed by [Cp*RuCl(cod)]32 or commercially available nanogold catalyst.33

As the alkyne hydration and hydrohalogenation
can be facilitated
by Lewis acid additives, we became curious to explore whether liquid
SO2 as a solvent bearing Lewis acid properties will have
the same promoting effect. Due to its relatively high boiling point
(bp −10.05 °C) and low vapor pressure (ca. 3 bar at 20
°C) compared to other gases,34 SO2 can be easily liquefied and handled in its liquid state.
Compared to conventional solvents, liquid SO2 has some
considerable advantages: (1) it dissolves both organic and inorganic
salts, due to the high dipole moment (1.6 D);35 (2) it is commercially available (≤5 EUR/kg) in high purity
(99.98%, H2O content ≤50 ppm); and (3) its removal
from the reaction mixture does not require heating under reduced pressure.
Since Walden observations of carbenium ion stability in liquid SO2 at the beginning of the 20th century,36 the application of liquid SO2 as a solvent has
been slowly expanded.37−47

Results and Discussion
Prompted by the fact that metal triflates
are an emerging catalyst
class in hydroelementation reactions in general and that besides the
title reactions, also triflate-catalyzed protocols for hydroalkoxylation,48,49 hydroamination,50,51 and hydrothiolation52,53 are known, we started our study by screening a series of metal triflates
M(OTf)n as catalysts for the alkyne hydration
in liquid SO2 employing phenyl acetylene (1a) as a model substrate (Table 1). In almost all cases, a formation of the desired acetophenone
(2a) was observed. Conversion to 2a did
not exceed 13% in the presence of Cu(I,II)a and
Yb(III) triflates (Table 1, entries 1–3), while the use of Al(III), Bi(III),
or Ag(I)a triflate improved the conversion of
the starting material to above 60% (Table 1, entries 4–6). Sc(III) and In(III)
triflates exhibited comparably high catalytic activity providing >70%
of acetophenone (2a) (Table 1, entries 7 and 8), but Hf(OTf)4 proved to be the most active hydration catalyst providing full conversion
(Table 1, entry 9).
The presence of vinyl triflate 3a (Table 1, entries 3 and 6) in the crude reaction
mixture may point to the reaction mechanism through this compound
as an intermediate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
report on Hf(OTf)4-catalyzed alkyne hydration.

a Reactions were carried out using 1a (1 mmol), M(OTf)n (10 mol %),
and H2O (3 equiv) in liquid SO2 (25 ± 5
g) at 60 °C for 16 h in a pressure reactor.

b Determined by 1H NMR
spectra on the crude reaction mixture using diphenyl methane as an
internal standard, samples were prepared by filtration of reaction
mixture in CHCl3 through a celite layer.

Based on economic considerations,
In(OTf)3 was the catalyst
of choice for further optimization of the reaction conditions (see Table S3, Supporting Information). It was found
that 10 mol % loading of In(OTf)3 and 100 °C are the
optimal conditions for the hydration of phenyl acetylene (1a) in liquid SO2 (Table S3,
entry 4). To avoid a practical problem associated with the isolation
of rather volatile product 2a, we continued the optimization
studies with 4-ethynylbiphenyl (1b). Using this more
reactive substrate, catalyst loading could be reduced to 1 mol % and
the temperature to 60 °C without a significant loss in the product
yield (Table S3, entry 7). Moreover, a
formation of the desired ketone 2b was observed even
in the absence of the catalyst at elevated temperature (20% isolated
yield at 105 °C: Table S3, entry 6).
On the other hand, when the amount of the water additive was reduced
to 1 equiv in the presence of catalyst, the conversion of acetylene 1b diminished, considerably (Table S3, entry 9).

It is also worth mentioning that the hydration
of phenyl acetylene
(1a) practically did not proceed in conventional solvents
such as EtOAc, MeCN, dimethyl sulfoxide, 1,4-dioxane, and sulfolane
under optimized reaction conditions (3 equiv H2O, 10 mol
% In(OTf)3, 100 °C).

To test the Brønsted
acidity of the reaction medium, we performed
a control experiment: a solution of PhNHBoc (1 equiv) and H2O (3 equiv) in liquid SO2 was heated at conditions equal
to those for the optimized hydration process of 4-ethynylbiphenyl
(1b) (Table S3, entry 7).
The acid-labile test substrate was recovered with 96% isolated yield
after chromatographic purification. This experiment shall indicate
that the overall acidity of the system should not be considered as
significantly acidic. We hypothesize that liquid SO2 as
solvent is a weak Lewis acid and is not efficient in stabilizing HSO3– anion. Therefore, the equilibrium SO2 + 2H2O → H3O+ + HSO3– is not efficiently shifted to the right
in the liquid SO2 medium.

Substrate scope for In(III)
or Hf(IV) triflate-catalyzed alkyne
hydration in liquid SO2 under optimized conditions is summarized
in Table 2. The reactivity
of an alkyne and consequently a choice of the catalyst and its loading
depend on the electronic effects of the substituents. Hence, phenyl
acetylenes 1d–j containing electron-donating
substituents (Alk-, AlkO-, ArO-) reacted smoothly in the presence
of ≤1 mol % In(OTf)3 (Table 2, entries 6–12). It should be mentioned
that the hydration occurred only to the benzylic position of diyne 1j, leaving the internal C≡C bond of the side chain
unreacted (Table 2,
entry 12). Taking alkyne 1f as an example, we demonstrated
that the hydration procedure can be performed in gram scale by using
a substrate/solvent mass ratio of 1:20 (Table 2, entry 8). Despite the presence of Lewis
basic nitrogen in para-amino-substituted phenyl acetylenes 1k,l, the corresponding aryl ketones 2k,l were isolated in good yields (Table 2, entries 13 and 14). Even N-Boc-protected aniline 1m as an acid-labile substrate
provided product 2m with 56% yield (Table 2, entry 15). Also, heterocyclic
substrate like 3-ethynylthiophene (1n) was compatible
with our newly developed hydration conditions in liquid SO2 in the presence of 1 mol % In(OTf)3 (Table 2, entry 16).

f The
reaction was carried out at

g The reaction
was carried out at
80 °C; formation of 1-(1,2-dibromovinyl)-4-propylbenzene as a
side product was observed.

An enhanced hydration reactivity in the presence of Hf(OTf)4 was demonstrated in the cases of substrates 1c and 1p (Table 2, entries 5 and 19). Thus, a quantitative yield of 2c was obtained in the presence of 1 mol % Hf(OTf)4, whereas
5 mol % In(OTf)3 provided lower yield (Table 2, entry 5 vs 4). This was even
more pronounced for the substrate 1p, where the switch
between both catalysts changed the yield from 9 to 82% (Table 2, entry 18 vs 19). Hf(OTf)4 performed well also for other disubstituted acetylenes like 1q,r (Table 2, entries 20 and 21), whereas 1-haloalkyne 1s was converted to the corresponding α-haloketone 2s in the presence of 10 mol % In(OTf)3 (Table 2, entry 22). Although aliphatic
alkynes did not react under the optimized reaction conditions, cyclopropyl
acetylene (1o) formed the hydration product 2o in good yield (Table 2, entry 17). Such a result could be explained by the ability of cyclopropyl
ring to stabilize the α-vinyl carbenium ion.54

Phenyl acetylenes 1t–v with electron-withdrawing
substituents had notably reduced reactivity compared to the substrates
containing electron-donating groups (Table 3). Thus, despite the positive mesomeric effect
of fluorine atom, its negative inductive effect reduces the reactivity
of p-fluorophenyl acetylene (1t) (Table 3, entries 1–4).
As a result, to reach full conversion of alkyne 1t, 5
mol % Hf(OTf)4 or 10 mol % In(OTf)3 was required
(Table 3, entries 4
and 2). Interestingly, for a sterically hindered o-fluoro-substituted analogue 1u, 10 mol % In(OTf)3 provided higher conversion of starting material than 5 mol
% Hf(OT)4 (Table 3, entry 5 vs 6). Employing alkyne 1v, practically
no ketone 2v was observed (Table 3, entries 7 and 8). Instead, under Hf(OTf)4-catalyzed conditions, the corresponding vinyl triflate 3v was formed and isolated in 45% yield based on the initial
triflate content in the reaction mixture (Table 3, entry 8).

Generation of vinyl triflates 3a (Table 1, entries 3 and 6) and 3t–v (Table 3,
entries 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8) might indicate
that the hydration proceeds through these species as the intermediates
(see Scheme S1, Supporting Information).
Stability of triflate 3 is higher when the benzylic carbenium
ion intermediate during the hydrolysis process is destabilized with
the electron-withdrawing groups. At first sight, we cannot exclude
that the transformation 1 → 3 can
occur due to the presence of trace amounts of triflic acid, which
might be released after hydrolysis of the metal triflate.55−59 Therefore, a control experiment 1b → 2b was performed in the presence of TfOH (1 mol %) (see Table S3, entry 8, Supporting Information). The
latter provided product 2b only with 15% isolated yield
contrary to 89% in the presence of In(OTf)3 (Table S3, entry 8 vs 7). At this point, we conclude
that under the developed experiment conditions, trace amounts of TfOH,
which might be present in the reaction mixture, can act as a background
mediator, but the observed excellent catalytic activity of In(OTf)3 and Hf(OTf)4 should be mainly attributed to the
nonhydrolyzed salt.

Inspired by the successful alkyne hydration
employing liquid SO2 as the solvent, we next turned our
attention to alkyne hydrohalogenation.
With reference to the Lewis acid-catalyzed hydroiodination of alkynes
published by Bartoli et al.,31 we screened
a reactivity of the group I and II metal halides and ammonium halides
toward phenyl acetylene (1a) in liquid SO2 under constant conditions (Table 4). The tested fluorides turned out to be unreactive
under these conditions. For chlorides, slightly higher reactivity
was observed, although the content of the desired α-vinyl chloride 6a in the reaction filtrate did not exceed 13% (GC–MS).
LiBr and MgBr2·6H2O exhibited the highest
reactivity among bromides, providing 96 and 77% (GC–MS) contents
of α-bromostyrene (5a) in the reaction filtrate,
respectively. Finally, all tested iodides led to the consumption of
the starting material. LiI led to a mixture of acetophenone (2a) and unidentified side products. Also, NaI provided ketone 2a from alkyne 1a, albeit in a quantitative manner.
Gratifyingly, K, Cs, and ammonium iodides provided the desired vinyl
iodide 4a in a good to excellent content with less than
5% of ketone 2a as an impurity (GC–MS). We can
assume that the relatively unstable α-iodostyrene does further
hydrolyze to acetophenone (2a) under the investigated
reaction conditions.

Screening for Alkyne
Hydrohalogenation in Liquid SO2a
a The reactions were carried out in
liquid SO2 (25 ± 5 g) in a pressure reactor; the numbers
describe the composition of the crude reaction mixture determined
by GC–MS; the best results are highlighted in green.

b MgBr2·6H2O or MgCl2·6H2O was used, respectively.

We suggest that the difference
of the reactivity among halides
could be explained by their solubility in liquid SO2. It
is known that the alkali metal halides are soluble in liquid SO2, but their solubility decreases in the order I– > Br– > Cl– > F–.60 Furthermore, the ability
of sulfur
dioxide to bind fluoride ion in a stable fluorosulfite ion can explain
that the reactivity of fluorides is completely suppressed under these
conditions.39 At the same time, a difference
between halides bearing the same anion indicates that also cationic
part of salt has its own effect on the course of the reaction. It
should be mentioned that NH4I was identified as a novel
source of both H+ and I– ions required
for alkyne hydroiodination. NH4I as a reagent does not
require the water additive, which makes the experimental procedure
even simpler.

With the screening results in hand (Table 4), we turned to the investigation
of the
substrate scope. It was found that each hydrohalogenation system still
required a “secondary optimization” depending on the
used substrates. The investigated alkyne hydrohalogenations proceeded
cleanly and provided easily analyzable mixtures of α-vinyl halide,
unreacted starting material, and ketone. Therefore, product yields
were determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy using internal standard.
The full data set can be found in the Supporting Information (CsI: Tables S4 and S5; NH4I: Table S6; KI: Table S7; NaI: Table S8; LiBr: Tables S9 and S10; CsBr and MgBr2·6H2O: Table S11; LiCl and MgCl2·6H2O: Table S12). The substrate scope of hydrohalogenation of terminal
aryl acetylenes is depicted in Scheme 1. NH4I, LiBr, NaI, KI, and CsI appeared
to be the most reactive halides, which required 3 h at 105 °C
to provide optimal yields of the expected products. Also, MgBr2·6H2O was reasonably reactive, albeit it required
9 h at 105 °C and a higher excess (3 equiv). In the least reactive
category, we can place CsBr, MgCl2·6H2O,
and LiCl, which required much higher temperature (150 °C) and
prolonged reaction times (19 h).

Isolated yield.

The yields of hydroiodination products exhibited the largest
data
scattering. This can be explained by a compromise between the aryl
alkyne reactivity and the hydrolytic stability of the formed vinyl
iodide. In general, electron-donating substituents (Scheme 1; 1b: R = Ph, 1c: R = Me, 1e: R = Pr) and weakly deactivation
substituents (1t: R = F) gave good to excellent yields
of products 4a–c, 4e, and 4t. Strong electron-donating substituents (1b: R = OMe)
and ortho-substituted systems (e.g., 1u) resulted in
mediocre yields of vinyl iodides due to the formation of ketone side
product or diminished reactivity, respectively. In this context, it
is clear that only salts bearing non-Lewis acidic cations (NH4+, Na+, K+, Cs+) can be successfully used in hydroiodination reactions in liquid
SO2 (see also remark on the synthesis of vinyl bromide 5h in the presence of LiBr; vide infra). Finally, substrate 1v possessing F3C substituent stayed rather intact
and gave 14% of a side product, which was identified as 1-(1,2-diiodovinyl)-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzene
(8). We have also tested NaHSO3 as an additional
proton source for alkyne protonation step (see Table S6, entry 10, Supporting Information), but this led
to a reduced rate of the hydrohalogenation reaction. On the other
hand, triphenylphosphine as a reductant of molecular iodine possibly
formed in the reaction mixture slightly improved the conversion of
alkynes 1 to the desired iodides 4 (Table S6, entries 3, 7, and 15).

Next,
we turned our attention to the synthesis of α-vinyl
bromides 5. First, the reactivity of LiBr was tested
(Scheme 1, see Tables S9 and S10, Supporting Information). The
influence of the substituent electronic effects on the course of the
reaction was not so significant as in the case of vinyl iodide synthesis.
Thus, aryl acetylenes 1a–g provided
up to quantitative yields of α-vinyl bromides 5a–g. By employing alkyne 1a, we demonstrated
that the hydrobromination can be excellently performed (91% of product 5a) in gram scale using a substrate/solvent mass ratio of
1:14. In contrast to iodides, no formation of the corresponding 1,2-dibromides
was observed. Interestingly, a combination of more reactive alkyne 1h, LiBr (3 equiv), and H2O (1.2 equiv) in liquid
sulfur dioxide already at −10 °C provided the expected
halide 5h in 57% yield. On the other hand, the same combination
at 105 °C provided ketone 2h (Table S10, entry 1). On the contrary, the tested iodides did
not react at such a low temperature. We also discovered that the formation
of ketone 2 was facilitated when methanol instead of
water was used as a proton source for the hydrobromination of alkyne 1e (Table S9, entry 13). MgBr2·6H2O behaved similar to LiBr, although a
prolonged reaction time was required to provide sufficient conversion
of the starting material (Scheme 1 and Table S11, Supporting
Information). Also, CsBr can be used as a bromide source (transformation 1c → 5c), albeit it required harsher reaction
conditions and provided only 62% of product 5c (Scheme 1, see Table S11, entry 3, Supporting Information).

On the basis of the successful modification of reaction conditions
in bromide series, we also explored a possibility to enhance the reactivity
of chloride ion sources. A comparable reactivity was observed when
MgCl2·6H2O or LiCl was used at 150 °C
(Scheme 1 and see Table S12, Supporting Information). Alkynes 1b and 1c containing weakly electron-donating
groups reacted smoothly, and the expected α-vinyl chlorides 6b and 6c were obtained in good yields (Table S12, entries 3–6). When less reactive
phenyl acetylene (1a) or 4-fluorophenyl acetylene (1t) was subjected to the same conditions, reaction yields
were affected by incomplete conversion of the starting material (Table S12, entries 1, 2, 7, and 8).

Unfortunately,
acetylenes containing acyclic aliphatic substituents
did not form the desired α-vinyl halides under the developed
conditions. LiBr was absolutely unreactive, but CsI and NH4I led to the formation of iodination products with varying conversion
levels of the starting material (see Tables S13 and S14, Supporting Information). Gratifyingly, cyclopropyl
acetylene (1o) exhibited a high reactivity, and full
conversion was observed in all of the tested conditions (Tables 5 and S15). Depending on the halide ion source and
the reaction conditions, a mixture of geometrical isomers of dihydrohalogenations 10 and 11 with or without desired cyclic vinyl
halide 9 was obtained. In both temperature regimes (60
and 105 °C), CsI produces all possible products 9a–11a (Table 5, entries 1 and 2). The reaction with NH4I exhibited a higher temperature dependence (Table 5, entries 3 and 4). Thus, at 105 °C,
NH4I gave only the rearranged products 10a and 11a in 83% total yield. LiBr gave dibromides 10b and 11b in synthetically useful yields with
average 10b/11b ratio 2.3:1 in either of
the tested temperature regimes (Table 5, entries 5 and 6).

Finally, we performed hydrohalogenation
reactions by employing
internal alkynes with at least one aromatic substituent attached to
the triple bond. As expected, in the case of phenylpropyne (1p), C-halogen bond was formed at the benzylic position, and
products 12a,b were isolated as a mixture

Hydrobromination
of alkyne 1r was (Z)-selective, and
the formation of regioisomers (Z)-13 and (Z)-14 was observed
(Scheme 2). Apparently,
the steric effects of the substrate forbid the formation (E)-isomers.

Scheme 2 Hydrobromination of Alkyne 1r in Liquid SO2
1-Bromoalkyne 1s was compatible only with
our hydrobromination
conditions, leading to the desired vinyl bromide 15 in
good yield (Scheme 3). When iodides were used under similar reaction conditions, only
the formation of a complex mixture was observed.

Scheme 3 Hydrobromination
of Alkyne 1s in Liquid SO2
In conclusion, we have discovered novel conditions
for alkyne hydration
and hydrohalogenation by taking advantages of liquid SO2 as a polar solvent with Lewis acid properties that is capable of
dissolving both organic and inorganic substances. As a result, a combination
of In(OTf)3 or Hf(OTf)4 as a catalyst and liquid
SO2 as a solvent allowed us to develop effective method
for the hydration of electron-rich terminal and internal aryl alkynes
without the direct addition of Brønsted acid. Catalyst loading
can be lowered to less than 1 mol % for alkynes containing strong
electron-donating groups. It has to be mentioned that Hf(OTf)4 has found an application in this chemical transformation
for the first time. By employing simple reagent systems like CsI,
KI, NaI, LiBr, or LiCl/H2O as well as solo reagents like
NH4I, MgBr2·6H2O, and MgCl2·6H2O, we have succeeded in the hydrohalogenation
of electron-rich aromatic alkynes in liquid SO2. Most of
these salts are used as halide sources in alkyne hydrohalogenation
for the first time. Moreover, ammonium iodide works as both iodide
and proton donor in a reaction mixture without the need for water
additive. Finally, the facilitated vinyl carbenium ion formation in
liquid sulfur dioxide and its quenching with nucleophiles like water
or halides opens possibilities for the design of other similar transformations
that would profit from the Lewis acidic and ionizing properties of
liquid SO2.

Experimental Section
General Experimental Details
Reactions at temperature
above the boiling point of SO2 (−10 °C) were
carried out in a stainless steel pressure reactor. For reactions below
SO2 boiling point, a two-neck round-bottom flask equipped
with a dry ice condenser was used. The solvents for reaction workup
and chromatographic purification were freshly distilled prior to use.
Commercially available reagents were used as received. Composition
of the final reaction mixture was determined by Agilent Technologies
6890N gas chromatograph coupled with Agilent Technologies 5975B mass
spectrometer (electron ionization (EI)) (for method description, see
the Supporting Information). Chromatographic
purification was monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on E.
Merck Kieselgel 60 F254, with detection by UV light or
a solution of potassium permanganate as a visualizing agent. Column
chromatography was performed on silica gel (60 Å, 40–60
μm, ROCC). Preparative chromatography for compounds (Z)-12 and (Z)-13 was performed on Macherey-Nagel Sil G-25 (60 Å, 5–17
μm) plates with detection by UV light. IR spectra were recorded
in KBr with Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) PerkinElmer Spectrum
BX spectrometer (4000–450 cm–1). Melting
point was recorded with a Fisher Digital Melting Point Analyzer model
355 apparatus. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded
with Bruker 300 MHz spectrometer in CDCl3. Chemical shifts
(δ) and coupling constants (J) are reported
in ppm and Hz, respectively. The residual solvent peak is used as
an internal reference (7.26 and 77.16 ppm for 1H NMR and 13C NMR, respectively). For quantitative 1H NMR
relaxation, time was increased (d1 = 10).
High-resolution mass (HRMS) (electrospray ionization (ESI)) were recorded
with an Agilent 1290 Infinity series ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography
connected to an Agilent 6230 time-of-flight mass spectrometer or (atmospheric
pressure chemical ionization (APCI)) on 7 T solariX XR (Bruker Daltonik
GmbH) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer
equipped with an APCI source.

General Procedure for Alkyne
Hydration in Liquid SO2
Alkyne (0.5–4.5
mmol), water (3 equiv), and catalyst
(see Tables 2 and 3) were placed into a stainless steel reactor equipped
with a glass tube and a magnetic stirring bar. The vacuum/argon cycles
were performed and sulfur dioxide (25 ± 5 g) was transferred
into the reactor at −78 °C by distillation. The reactor
was sealed and the reaction was performed under pressure (∼8
bar) at 60 °C for 16–18 h. Then, the reactor was cooled
down to room temperature and connected to either the storage cylinder
of SO2 for the solvent recycling or a trap containing aqueous
NaHCO3 solution for SO2 removal. The solid residue
was partitioned between dichloromethane (DCM) (10–20 mL) and
water (5–15 mL). The aqueous phase was extracted with DCM (3
× 5–10 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over
anhydrous Na2SO4 and filtered. Concentration
of the filtrate under reduced pressure gave a residue that was fractionated
by column chromatography (EtOAc/Hex) to provide pure product. Note:
for volatile hydration products 2a, 2c, 2n, 2o, and 2t, yield was determined
by quantitative 1H NMR analysis of the reaction extract
using diphenyl methane as an internal standard.

General
Procedure for Alkyne Hydrohalogenation in Liquid SO2
Alkyne, halide, and water (for the following halides:
LiCl, LiBr, NaI, KI, CsBr, and CsI) or alkyne and halide (for the
following halides: NH4I, MgCl2·6H2O, and MgBr2·6H2O) were placed in a stainless
steel reactor equipped with a glass tube and a magnetic stirring bar.
The vacuum/argon cycles were performed, and sulfur dioxide (25 ±
5 g) was transferred into the sealed reactor at −78 °C
by distillation. The reactor was sealed, and the reaction was performed
under pressure at elevated temperature (p ∼
20 bar at 105 °C) for the time specified in Tables 5 and 6, Schemes 1–3. Then, the reactor was
cooled down to room temperature and connected to either the storage
cylinder of SO2 for the solvent recycling or a trap containing
aqueous NaHCO3 solution for SO2 removal. To
the solid residue, ∼10 mL of DCM or chloroform was added. The
resulting mixture was filtered through cotton wool or celite layer
and (variations): (1) evaporated; (2) evaporated, treated with hexane
and silica gel, filtered, and evaporated; (3) washed with saturated
NaHCO3, 10% Na2S2O3, and
brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and evaporated;
and (4) washed with saturated NaHCO3, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and evaporated. The obtained final
residue was quantitatively analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy
using diphenyl methane or m-tolyl aldehyde (only
for 4h and 5h) as an internal standard.
