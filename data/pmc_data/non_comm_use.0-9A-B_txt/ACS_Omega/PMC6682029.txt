A new series of 2-aminoethyl-benzene-based
biomaterials, namely,
dopamine (DOP), tyramine (TYR), phenylethylamine (PEA), and epinephrine
(EPN), dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) have been investigated
for CO2 capture upon activatiing their hydhydrochloride salts 
with a NaOH pellet. Spectroscopic measurements, including ex situ
ATR-FTIR, 1D and 2D NMR experiments have been applied to verify
the formation of the sodium carbamate adducts (RR′N-CO2– Na+). The emergence of new
peaks in the IR spectra ranging between 1702 and 1735 cm–1 together with the chemical shift within 157–158 ppm in the 13C NMR, as well as with cross-peaks obtained by 1H-15N HSQC measurements at ca. 84 and 6.6 ppm verified
the formation of RR′N-CO2– Na+ products upon the chemical fixation of CO2. The
CO2 sorption capacity of the examined biomaterials was
evaluated volumetrically, with a maximum value of 8.18 mmol CO2·g–1 sorbent (36.0 (w/w)%, including
both chemisorption and physisorption), for 5 (w/v)% solutions measured
at 5 bar CO2 and 25 °C, for TYR and PEA. DFT calculations
indicated that the intramolecular hydrogen bonding within the structural
motif of EPN-N-CO2– Na+ adduct
provides an exceptional stability compared to monoethanolamine and
other structurally related model compounds.

1 Introduction
Fossil
fuels consumption associated with emitting huge amounts
of CO2 is directly connected to the global warming phenomenon.1 The negative consequences of climate change directed
the efforts of politicians and scientists to legislate restrict policies
and find new approaches to mitigate further CO2 accumulation
in the atmosphere to avoid the catastrophic two-degree scenario above
the preindustrial revolution era.2,3 Currently,
there are four main approaches to alleviate this problem, which are
carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), direct air capture (DAC),
carbon capture and recycling (CCR), and capture and utilization (CCU).
The ultimate goal of CCS and DAC is to store and, for the latter,
most probably exploit CO2 as a renewable feedstock in the
fine chemical industry, which might be dealt with on a later stage
as CCU.4,5 The sorption of CO2 takes place
via either physisorption or chemisorption. Either processes might
require the presence of a nucleophilic atom (e.g., N or O), which
results in the formation of carbamic acid (RR′N-CO2H)/carbamate (RR′N-CO2– X+; X: sacrificial base, or metal) or carbonate (ionic organic
(RO-CO2– X+)/inorganic XnCO3) adducts (Scheme 1).6 Primary and
secondary amines are known to directly attack CO2 to form
the organic CO2 sequestered adduct(s), while tertiary amines
lack transferable protons and tend to form inorganic bicarbonates
exclusively in aqueous media.7

Scheme 1 CO2 Reaction Pathways with: (A) Interaction of CO2 with Amines at Dry and Wet Conditions, (B) Alcohols in the
Presence of a Superbase (SB), Following 1:2 (Carbamate) and 1:1 (Carbamic
Acid or Organic Carbonate) Reaction Mechanism
The
presence of water and ammonium
carbamate (in (A)) results in the formation of inorganic bicarbonate.

Aqueous amine solutions are considered the most
economical technology
for postcombustion CO2 capture. In this respect, 30 wt
% aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) solution (with a sorption capacity
7 wt %)8 is extensively studied since its
patented by Bottoms in 1930.9 The intrinsic
drawbacks of aqueous amine solutions such as high regeneration temperatures,
thermal degradation, and evaporation losses moved the attention of
scientists into sterically hindered amines, which are primary or secondary
amine-based compounds where the amino groups are attached to a tertiary
carbon or a secondary/tertiary carbon, respectively. They tend to
form relatively unstable carbamates with fast reaction kinetics compared
to conventional amine wet scrubbing agents10,11 As a breakthrough, the use of task-specific ionic liquids (TSILs),
namely, (1-n-propylamine-3-butylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate),
showed 7.4 wt % gain due to CO2 capture.12 Other TSILs, including conventional and reversible ILs,
are used for CO2 capturing technology, as reviewed by Park
and co-workers.13 Moreover, CO2-binding organic liquids (CO2-BOLs), which are composed
of alcohols and organic superbases (SBs), such as amidines or guanidines
containing SB, that chemically bind CO2 as ionic organic
carbonate, with a CO2 sorption capacity of 19 wt %,8,14,15 and the use of polar aprotic
solvents, represents another alternative method.16−18 In this context,
green chemistry offers an opportunity for chemists and engineers to
design benign routes by preventing waste and eliminating the need
for energy-intensive processes to ultimately achieve sustainable development.19 Of particular importance, in our study, is to
follow and enhance green chemistry principles that highlights the
implementation of renewable feedstocks for CO2 capturing
(for a broad overview about green chemistry, the readers are directed
toward review articles by Paul Anastas and co-workers20−22).

Our research group and others have utilized green, as well
as oxygen-
and nitrogen-rich synthetic and/or biofeedstock sorbents such as oligourea,23 cellulose,24−26 chitin/chitosan,27−31 and cyclodextrin32,33 as solid and wet sorbents for
CO2 capturing via supramolecular chemisorption or activation
by superbases through the formation of RO-CO2– Y+ (Y+: organic or inorganic counter cation).
Moreover, Stoddart and co-workers reported on the synthesis and characterization
of a series of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) composed of γ-cyclodextrin
that chemisorbed CO2 reversibly34−37 (see ref (38) for more examples). Other
nitrogen-rich biomaterials such as amino acids were found to be effective
for CO2 capturing through the formation of ammonium carbamate
or carbamic acid adducts. Bhattacharyya and Shah reported on the use
of a series of low-viscosity, choline (Cho)-based amino acid ILs to
capture CO2 with a reasonable sorption capacity of ca.
19 wt %.39 In addition, Zou’s group40 and others41 explored
the mechanism of CO2 binding by neat Cho-proline IL and
its solution in nonaqueous solvents (including poly(ethylene glycol)
and dimethylsulfoxide, DMSO), with a sorption capacity of 0.6:1 M
ratio of CO2-IL at approximately 1 bar pressure.40 The mechanism of CO2 sorption by
the aqueous solutions of Cho-ILs composed of alanine, proline, and
glycine indicated the formation of carbamate adduct at low concentration
and inorganic carbonate if the concentration exceeded 5 wt %.42 Such materials were further exploited as catalysts
for cyclic carbonate synthesis.43

Very recently, our group has reported on the chemisorption of CO2 by biomaterials, viz., epinephrine,44 (EPN, a catecholamine neurotransmitter, Scheme 2) when dissolved in DMSO through the formation
of alkali metal carbamate (RR′NCO2–X+) upon activation of its acidic form with a metal hydroxide.
According to National Institutes of Health, biomaterials are defined
as any matter, surface, or construct that interacts with biological
systems that can be derived from nature or synthesized in the laboratory
using metallic components, polymers, ceramics, or composite materials.
The aim of this work is to investigate selected biomaterials with
common structural motifs of EPN-like compounds, viz., dopamine (DOP),
tyramine (TYR), and phenylethylamine (PEA), as shown in Scheme 2. The impact of the amine category
(primary or secondary), the catecholic or phenolic part, and the absence
of the aliphatic hydroxyl group are all considered in exploring the
overall mechanism of CO2 capturing. The reaction of these
biomaterials with CO2 has been investigated using nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) and ex situ attenuated total reflectance-Fourier
transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy techniques. Moreover, volumetric
CO2 uptake was measured using an in situ ATR-FTIR autoclave
equipped with a digital manometer. Furthermore, density functional
theory (DFT) calculations were employed to explore the mechanism of
carbamation reactions.

2 Results
and Discussion
Under air conditions, the color change associated
with EPN·HCl
upon activation with a metal hydroxide44 is an indicator of oxidation as a result of hydroquinone/quinone
conversion,45 which motivates exploring
the stability of related biomaterial architectures. The photographs
of EPN·HCl, DOP·HCl, TYR·HCl, and PEA·HCl dissolved
in DMSO before and after activation with a NaOH pellet are shown in Figure 1. Although it is
poorly soluble in DMSO (≤1 mg/mL),46l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA, the precursor
of EPN and DOP, another catecholamine neurotransmitter) was used as
a control sample. The obtained color change after sonication in the
presence of the base indicated that EPN and DOP were readily oxidized,
followed by l-DOPA and TYR, while no change was observed
in the case of PEA. After 24 h, the TYR solution resisted the oxidation
to some extent in comparison to l-DOPA, while PEA solution
indicated excellent stability. Similar to PEA, ephedrine (with no
phenolic or catecholic functionalities) is more structurally related
to EPN; however, it is categorized as prescription-controlled material,
which restricted its commercial availability for further testing.

PEA·HCl solutions in DMSO: (A) readily after preparation,
(B) and (C) upon activation with NaOH after 10 min and 24 h, respectively
(Photograph courtesy of ‘Farah Mustafa’, Copyright 2019).

DOP is structurally similar to
EPN, except the presence of a primary
rather than secondary amine group and the absence of the aliphatic
hydroxyl group as shown in Scheme 2. The 13C NMR spectrum of DOP·HCl dissolved
in DMSO-d6 shows eight peaks related to
its backbone and an additional one at 124.2 ppm upon bubbling CO2 corresponding to the physically sorbed CO2 (Figure S1, Supporting Information, SI). After
activation using NaOH, the 13C NMR spectrum of DOP confirmed
the chemisorption of CO2 by emerging new chemical shifts
centered at 157 and 158 ppm (Figure A2).
This indicated the reaction of DOP with CO2 in the presence
of NaOH along with the formation of both DOP-N-CO2– Na+ and inorganic bicarbonate.44

Moreover, TYR, a biogenic amine formed
by the enzymatic decarboxylation
of tyrosine,47 dissolved in DMSO-d6, showed a similar response compared to DOP·HCl
by the emergence of two new peaks in the 13C NMR measurement
within the region 157–158 ppm (Figure B2), which also indicated the same mechanism (vide supra) of interaction
with CO2 as in the case of DOP.

The potential carbamation
reactions of DOP·HCl and its neutral
basic form dissolved in DMSO were further explored using ex situ ATR-FTIR
spectroscopy before (green trace) and after (blue trace) bubbling
CO2. As presented in Figure 2 and 3A, the peak at 2337 cm–1 represented the asymmetric stretching of the physisorbed
CO2, while the peak at 1718 cm–1 denoted
the formation of DOP-N-CO2–Na+, which verified the results obtained by 13C NMR spectroscopy
and in a good agreement with the results recorded previously for EPN.44 Moreover, the ATR-FTIR spectra of TYR fortified
the chemisorption of CO2 through the emergence of a new
peak at 1701 cm–1 (Figure 3B).

and (B) TYR·HCl:

TYR·HCl solutions
before (green) and after (blue) activation with NaOH and bubbling

Supported by the visual color change of the activated biomaterials
(vide supra), the anticipated stability of PEA (a naturally occurring
amine that resembles an amphetamine from both pharmacological and
structural aspects)48 due to the absence
of catecholic functionality, triggered further investigation toward
CO2 capturing. Upon dissolving in DMSO and activation with
an NaOH pellet, 13C NMR and ATR-FTIR measurements confirmed
the formation of a solely captured species (PEA-N-CO2–Na+) due to the emergence of new peaks around
157 ppm and 1702 cm–1, respectively (Figure 4). The difference in chemical
shift between the starting materials and the sequestered adducts of
DOP, TYR, and PEA is shown in Table S1,
SI. The most drastic difference was observed between the neighboring
and the second neighboring carbons to the nitrogen, which confirmed
the formation of the suggested carbamate adduct.

and 5.0 bar.

To ensure that the carbamation
reaction occurred at the nitrogen
atom of the various 2-aminoethyl-benzene scaffolds, 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy (HSQC)
measurements were performed. After activation and bubbling with CO2, the 2D spectra of the three compounds indicated a downfield 15N chemical shift (observed at ca. 84 ppm, Figure 5) in comparison to the primary
aliphatic ammonium ions that ranged between 20 and 60 ppm.49 This is consistent with our previous measurements
using EPN.44

and (C) PEA in DMSO-d6 with CO2 bubbling after activation with NaOH.

2.1 Volumetric Uptake Measurements
The
sorption capacity of 5 (w/v)% solutions of the examined substrates
dissolved in DMSO was measured using an in situ ATR-FTIR autoclave
coupled with a digital manometer. The amount of the sorbed CO2 was calculated volumetrically upon substituting the pressure
drop after correction against DMSO in the equation of state of ideal
gas (PV = nRT), and the results
are presented in Table 1. The results indicated that EPN sorbed 1.64 mmol CO2·g–1 sorbent, while DOP (the other structurally similar
substrate) exhibited only half the sorption capacity, with 0.82 mmol
CO2·g–1 sorbent. This behavior was
attributed to the extra ion–dipole interaction between the
metal carbamate and the aliphatic hydroxyl group of EPN, which is
absent in the case of DOP. This offers a distinct stability of the
sequestered adduct and thus better performance characteristics of
EPN over the latter as inferred from reaction free-energy values that
were obtained from the DFT calculations (vide infra). In a similar
context, TYR and PEA showed larger sorption capacity values with 2.46
mmol CO2·g–1 sorbent. A partial
in situ ATR-FTIR spectrum of PEA solution is shown in Figure 4C. An in-depth insight into
the chemical structure of the 2-aminoethyl-benzene moieties shows
that both PEA and TYR have more nonpolar character (benzene and phenol,
respectively) compared to the other catecholic moieties and tend to
be more CO2-philic, which might explain the better performance.
The sorption capacity of the latter two compounds was so close with
that obtained for MEA under the same experimental conditions, which
might be an excellent indicator for a similar mechanism of the examined
biomaterial compounds with CO2 action and the benchmark
sorbent.

The
absence of universal protocols to evaluate the CO2 capture
in terms of the measurement techniques and the sorption
conditions make it hard to hold a fair comparison between the sorption
capacities of different sorbents. However, such comparison provides
a useful indicator for assessing the performance characteristics of
the examined systems. In comparison to other nitrogen-rich, biorenewable
CO2-philes reported previously such as chitin and chitosan
dissolved in different solvents such as ILs,27 DMSO,30,31 or even neat lysine-based IL,39 our measurements showed comparable sorption
capacity values. However, we cannot overemphasize on results due to
the different mechanism of action, as shown in Table 1.

2.2 Quantum Chemical Calculations
The
reaction of 2-aminoethyl-benzene-based biomaterials with CO2 was also investigated using quantum chemical calculations, in addition
to MEA as a reference compound. The geometry of the anticipated products
was optimized in DMSO as an implicit solvent, applying the polarizable
continuum model (PCM). Minima were characterized by the absence of
imaginary frequencies. In principle, the substrates are capable of
reacting with CO2 and produce the correspondent carbamate
adducts in after activation with NaOH. Although the hydroxyl groups
are also potential reaction sites, previous DFT calculations with
EPN showed that the amine groups are more reactive.44Figure 6 shows the optimized structure of the sequestrated products, and
the carbamate (−NCOO–) adduct is stabilized
by ion–ion interaction with Na+, as indicated by
the short interaction distances (Figure 6). In the case of EPN, the structure of the
formed adduct is stabilized by an additional intramolecular hydrogen
bond (ca. 1.72 Å) between one of the oxygens on the carbamate
group and the adjacent hydroxyl group (Figure 6). This further verified the volumetric uptake
measurement of EPN.

Figure 6 DFT-optimized structures of EPN, MEA, DOP, TYR, PEA, and
the associated
reaction free energy (ΔG in kcal/mol) for the
chemical fixation of CO2 in DMSO upon activation with NaOH.

The reaction free energies (ΔG) for all
reactions were calculated for the formation of the metal carbamate;
the calculated values are given in Figure 6. The calculated ΔG values for the carbamation reactions were negative for all of the
investigated compounds, indicating a favorable process. Moreover,
the latter values indicated that the formation of the carbamate adduct
is the most favorable in the case of EPN (ΔG = 36 kcal/mol) compared to the other amines, which was in accordance
with the additional stabilization through the hydrogen bonding of
the neighboring hydroxyl group with no significant differences recorded
for the other substrates (ΔG ∼ 29 kcal/mol).
The reaction of 2-aminoethyl-benzene-based biomaterials followed the
order EPN ≫ PEA >TRY > MEA > DOP. It is also anticipated
that
the hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring do not have a substantial
effect on the reaction.

3 Conclusions
In this
work, we presented a basic understanding of using several
2-aminoethyl-benzene-based biomaterial moieties dissolved in DMSO
for CO2 capture. Both NMR and ATR-FTIR spectroscopic measurements
supported the chemisorption of CO2 through the formation
of sodium carbamate adduct. The volumetric CO2 uptake data
indicated that the best sorption capacity was achieved by tyramine
and phenylethylamine, while DFT calculations showed that epinephrine-sodium
carbamate was the most stable adduct among the other investigated
compounds even when compared to monoethanolamine. The extra stability
was attributed to short-range intermolecular forces.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals
All
reagents were obtained
from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Epinephrine
hydrochloride (EPN·HCl), dopamine hydrochloride (DOP·HCl),
tyramine hydrochloride (TYR·HCl), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO-d6, 99.5 atom % D), and monoethanolamine (MEA,
98%, d = 1.012 g·mL–1) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 2-Phenylethylamine hydrochloride (PEA·HCl,
99%) and (DMSO, 99.8%) were purchased from Fluka and TEDIA, respectively. l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA, 98.5%) was purchased
from S D Fine-Chem Ltd. The hydroxide bases NaOH and KOH (as pellets)
were obtained from Gainland Chemical Co. and Net Tech Ltd., respectively.
CO2 (industrial grade) and N2 (industrial grade)
were purchased from Advanced Technical Gases Co. (Amman, Jordan).

4.2 Instruments
Solution 1H, 13C, and 15N nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectra were collected at room temperature using (AVANCE- III
400 MHz (1H: 400.13 MHz, 13C: 100.61 MHz, 15N: 40.560 MHz) FTNMR NanoBay spectrometer (Bruker, Switzerland).
Ex situ ATR-FTIR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Vertex 70-FT-IR
spectrometer at room temperature coupled with a Vertex Pt-ATR-FTIR
accessory. In situ ATR-FTIR measurements were carried out using an
MMIR45 m RB04-50 (Mettler Toledo, Switzerland) with an MCT detector
with a diamond-window probe connected via a pressure vessel.

4.3 Experimental Procedures
In a Schlenk
flask, 40 mg (0.2 mmol) of DOP·HCl was dried under vacuum for
2 h, then dissolved in 1.0 mL of DMSO-d6, stirred and bubbled with CO2 under Schlenk line for
30 min before and after activation using KOH (ca. 203 mg, 3.6 mmol)
and NaOH (ca. 513 mg, 12.8 mmol) pellets. In the same manner, TYR·HCl
(ca. 25 mg, 0.14 mmol) and PEA·HCl (ca. 32 mg, 0.2 mmol) were
directly dissolved in 1.0 ml of DMSO-d6, activated with KOH (ca. 184 mg, 3.3 mmol) and NaOH (ca. 492 mg,
12.3 mmol) under CO2 bubbling and stirring for 30 min.
For the ex situ ART-FTIR measurements, the same procedures were followed
by using DMSO rather than the deuterated solvent. For comparison purposes,
the spectroscopic results of the samples activated by KOH are shown
in the Supporting Information.

For
the volumetric CO2 measurements, a 5% (w/v) solution of
scrubbing agent (EPN, DOP·HCl, TYR, PEA, or MEA) and DMSO is
prepared in an argon-filled glovebox. After addition of a NaOH pellet
and sonication for 20–40 min, 10 mL of the solution is transferred
to an autoclave. The solution is stirred at 500 rpm for 3 min, followed
by pressurizing the autoclave with 5 bar CO2. The reaction
is monitored for 30 min until reaching a constant pressure. For the
color visualization experiment, 30 mg of each molecule was dissolved
in 1.0 mL of DMSO using a 10.0 mL vial and sonicated for 10 min upon
activation using NaOH pellet (281 mg, 7.0 mmol).

4.4 DFT Calculations
DFT calculations
were performed using the M06-2X functional and the 6-311G** basis
set in Gaussian 09 package. The molecular structure of the compounds
in ground state was optimized in DMSO as an implicit solvent, applying
the polarizable continuum model (PCM), and found to be minima, as
indicated by the absence of imaginary frequencies.
