Phosgene, a widely used but highly toxic substance, may
pose a
serious risk to public safety and health because of the potential
abuse and possible accidental leakage. Consequently, it is of great
significance to develop a rapid, reliable, and sensitive detection
method for this noxious agent. In this work, an aggregation-induced
emission-based sensor, 3,6-bis(1,2,2-triphenylvinyl)benzene-1,2-diamine
(DATPE), has been rationally designed for detecting phosgene by conjugation
of o-phenylenediamine (OPD) core as the reactive
recognition moiety decorated with two peripheral triphenylethylene
(TPE) units. A light-up fluorescence response is achieved by the fast
cyclization reaction of OPD part and phosgene along with the formation
of 2-imidazolidinone ring, thus inhibiting the intramolecular charge
transfer quenching process in the sensor. Moreover, an easy-to-use
test paper with DATPE is fabricated for onsite visual detection of
phosgene in the gas phase even at a concentration of as low as 0.1
ppm.

==== Body
Introduction
Phosgene (COCl2) is a highly
poisonous gas was utilized
as a chemical warfare agent (CWA) and led to heavy casualties in World
War I.1 This colorless gas is a lung irritant
with a very deceptive poison, which does not induce irritation instantly
after inhalation even at a lethal concentration. Severe pulmonary
complications appear after a few hours, even causing death.2 This poisoning feature makes phosgene barely
perceivable and raises the risk of death. Unlike other CWAs, such
as sarin and soman, whose production and usage are very strictly regulated
and prohibited by international laws, phosgene is much more easily
available owing to its wide and important application in the production
of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and isocyanate-based polymers.3 In light of its unexpected leakage in industrial
accidents and the potential abuse by terrorist, phosgene virtually
poses a great threat to public health and safety. Consequently, it
is of great significance to develop prompt, reliable, and portable
methods for detecting phosgene.

Although several methods based
on various principles have been
reported for phosgene detection, such as gas chromatography, Raman,
and electrochemical techniques,4−6 they are still limited by poor
portability, high cost, and sophisticated procedures. In contrast,
fluorescence-based sensing systems are strikingly advantageous because
of their low cost, high sensitivity, simple operation, and great convenience
for field detection.7 Over the past years,
a variety of fluorescent sensors for phosgene have been developed
by utilizing different fluorophores, such as BODIYs,8−12 coumarins,13,14 rhodamines,15,16 naphthalimides,17−20 and others.21−28 In general, the molecular design strategy mainly depends on phosgene-mediated
reactions with electron-donating amine or hydroxyl groups in these
sensors, resulting in the generation of electron-withdrawing carbamate,
urea, or nitrile. These specific transformations typically lead to
the suppression of fluorescence quenching processes, including photoinduced
electron transfer (PET),9−11,13,21 intramolecular charge transfer (ICT),8,14,17−19,25 or excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT).20,22 Additionally, other sensing reactions mediated by phosgene involve
the ring-opening of amino-containing spiro-(deoxy)lactam,15 cyclization of hydroxyl cinnamic acids,27 and hetero-cross-linking of amino-containing
acceptor and donor fluorophores to give a FRET process.28

Despite the successful utilization of
these above fluorescent sensors
in detecting phosgene, most of them are based on aggregation-caused
quenching (ACQ) fluorophores. They suffer from fluorescent reduction
or even quenching in solid state, meaning that they are not good candidates
for developing highly sensitive and portable sensing system for onsite
detecting phosgene. On the other hand, aggregation-induced emission
(AIE) fluorogenic molecules are weak or nonemissive in the solution
state but are highly emissive in the solid state owing to the restriction
of intramolecular rotation.29,30 Therefore, AIE-based
sensing systems are more suitable for preparing solid-state portable
test strip in comparison to ACQ counterparts. However, little attention
has been devoted to this process. Up to now, there are only two AIE
sensors based on tetraphenylethene23 and
2-(2′-hydroxyphenyl)benzothiazole24 with low detections limits of 1.87 and 0.34 ppm for detecting phosgene
in gas phase, respectively. Nevertheless, the development of AIE-based
probes for sensing gaseous phosgene with high sensitivity, fast response,
and noticeable color changes still remains a challenge.

In this
work, we report the rational design of an AIE-based sensor
DATPE for light-up detecting phosgene, in which the reactive recognition
moiety of o-phenylenediamine (OPD) core is conjugated
with two peripheral triphenylethylene (TPE) units as AIE-active fluorophores
(Scheme 1). The two
free amino groups in DATPE are beneficial to the rapid and effective
acylation by phosgene with a formation of five-membered imidazolidinone
ring. As a result, the original ICT quenching process from the electron-donating
OPD to peripheral TPE part in DATPE was greatly depressed, giving
a highly AIE emissive sensing product 4,7-bis(1,2,2-triphenylvinyl)-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-one
(IMPTE). In particular, a portable test strip with DATPE was fabricated
for gaseous phosgene detection with a visual detection limit as low
as 0.1 ppm, representing one of the most sensitive sensors for phosgene
in the gas phase (Scheme S1 and Table S1 in the Supporting Information).

Scheme 1 Chemical Structures of Sensor DAPTE
with a Weak AIE Emission and
the Sensing Reaction Product IMTPE with a High AIE Emission, Respectively
Results and Discussion
The AIE-based sensor DATPE was
readily prepared by two-step reactions
of Suzuki coupling and subsequent reductive ring opening, as depicted
in Scheme 2. Additionally,
DATPE can rapidly react with phosgene that was in situ produced by
the decomposition of triphosgene under the assistance of triethylamine
(TEA),8 giving the proposed sensing product
IMTPE. Then, their AIE properties were investigated by using a mixture
of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and water system (Figure 1). As expected, both DATPE and IMTPE are
almost nonemissive in a pure THF solution. Also, their photoluminescence
(PL) intensity still remains very weak in aqueous mixtures with water
fraction less than 70% (fw ≤ 70%),
while the PL intensity begins to rise swiftly for fw > 70% due to the constraint of intramolecular motion
thus turning on the AIE process. It is calculated that the PL intensities
of DATPE and IMTPE are increased by 21- and 542-fold from those of
the pure THF solution and THF–H2O mixture with 95%
water content, respectively. The significant enhancement of AIE emission
for IMTPE should be attributed to the inhibited ICT quenching process
by the carbamylation of OPD moiety in DATPE. Therefore, it is revealed
that the DATPE sensor can serve as a turn-on AIE probe for detecting
phosgene.

mixtures (concentration = 10 μM; λex = 360
nm). Inset: plot of (I/I0–1) values versus the water fraction (fw) of THF-H2O mixture.

Scheme 2 Synthetic Route for Sensor DATPE and Reaction Product
IMTPE. Reagents
and Conditions: (a) Pd(PPh3)4, Cs2CO3, CsF, Toluene/H2O, 90 °C for 2 d;
(b) NaBH4, CoCl2, EtOH/THF, 90 °C for 3
h; and (c) Triphosgene, TEA, DCM, 10 min
Considering their very weak emissions of the
probe DATPE and proposed
sensing product IMTPE in pure THF solution, the aqueous THF with 95%
water content was used to monitor the PL response of DATPE toward
phosgene in the solution phase. Specifically, the sensing reaction
of DATPE with phosgene that was in situ generated by the decomposition
of triphosgene was first performed in THF solution for 2 min. After
that, the reaction mixture was quickly diluted to 95% aqueous solution
for PL measurements. As shown in Figure 2a, a remarkable PL enhancement with a growing
emission centered at 496 nm was clearly observed upon increasing the
amount of triphosgene. Also, the PL intensity can be increased by
21-fold relative to that of the original DATPE solution after the
addition of 2 equiv triphosgene, in which a bright blue fluorescence
was easily detected by the naked eye under 365 nm light. The detection
limit was evaluated to be 21 nM by fitting the emission titration
data. Then, the selectivity of DATPE for detecting phosgene was investigated
and compared with other reactive toxic chemicals, including acylating/phosphorylating
agents (CH3COCl, BzCl, C2O2Cl2, SOCl2, SO2Cl2, POCl3, TsCl, BsCl), and a nerve-agent mimic diethyl chlorophosphate
(DCP). As illustrated in Figure 2b, a dramatic PL enhancement occurred only for phosgene,
while no remarkable change was detected for other analytes, confirming
the high selectivity of DATPE toward phosgene over other analytes.
Also, the different changes can be clearly and easily observed by
the naked eye under a handheld 365 nm lamp (Figure 2b inset).

(fw = 95%) with different amounts of triphosgene
(0–20 μM). Inset: plot of the relative PL intensity (I/I0) as a function of triphosgene
concentration. (b) Relative PL intensity upon addition of addition

chloride (BsCl); and 10, benzoyl chloride (BzCl).

To further verify the proposed sensing mechanism
(Scheme 1), the sensing
reaction of
DATPE with triphosgene/TEA was performed and analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy in CDCl3. As depicted in Figure 3a, the free sensor DATPE displays
three types of proton signals, in which the broad peak with a chemical
shift at 3.26 ppm was assigned to four hydrogen (H1) signals from
free NH2 of OPD part. Upon the addition of triphosgene
TEA, the H1 proton signal in DATPE disappeared but with a simultaneous
appearance of a new peak at 6.67 ppm (Figure 3b). This new peak can be assigned to the
NH protons (H1′) in the sensing reaction product IMTPE, indicative
of the efficient intramolecular cyclization reaction with a rapid
formation of five-membered 2-imidazolidinone ring. Besides, the H2
peak of aromatic hydrogens in OPD part was found to be downfield shifted
with a Δδ of 0.17 ppm relative to free DATPE, which should
be induced by the electron-withdrawing effect of carbonyl C=O
group in the sensing reaction product. Also, the 1H NMR
peaks of the reaction mixture can be matched pretty well with those
of neat IMPTPE, further confirming the identity of the proposed sensing
product.

Figure 3 Partial 1H NMR (400 MHz) spectra of DATPE (a) upon addition
of triphosgene with TEA continuously recorded after 1 min (b) and
10 min (c), as well as neat IMTPE (d) in CDCl3.

In contrast to ACQ-based fluorophores that suffer
from fluorescence
quenching in the aggregated state or at high concentrations, AIE-based
fluorophores should be more advantageous for developing solid-state
sensory devices to detect gaseous phosgene. Thus, a test strip has
been facilely fabricated by immobilizing DATPE on a filter paper with
polystyrene. Initially, the test strip embedded with DATPE is almost
nonemissive under a handheld UV lamp because of the ICT quenching
process (Figure 4).
As expected, a light-up blue fluorescence is clearly observed after
instant exposure of the strip to phosgene for several seconds and
prolonged 1 min for a stable balance. The test strip becomes brighter
with the increase of phosgene concentration (0.1–5 ppm). Remarkably,
the test strip with DATPE can give a very noticeable response at a
low concentration of 0.5 ppm phosgene gas. Also, it can still be detected
by the naked eye even when the concentration of phosgene is as low
as 0.1 ppm. This indicates that the AIE-based DATPE solid-state platform
is among the most sensitive sensors for detecting phosgene gas, validating
its ability for onsite monitoring of trace phosgene in specific events.
Furthermore, the selectivity of the DATPE strip for phosgene over
other analytes was evaluated. As shown in Figure 4b, after exposing different strips to various
toxic vapors, the test paper only displays a turn-on fluorescence
change for phosgene, whereas no significant change occurs in strips
exposed to other analyte vapors. These above results indicate that
this DATPE test strip is a potential tool for highly sensitive and
selective detection of phosgene gas.

Conclusions
In summary, we have rationally developed
an AIE-based sensor DATPE
for detecting phosgene with a light-up fluorescent response, which
is readily constructed by conjugation of the central o-phenylenediamine moiety and two peripheral triphenylethylene units
acting as the reactive recognition site and AIE-active fluorophores,
respectively. The sensing reaction of DATPE to phosgene greatly depressed
the original ICT quenching process, affording a highly AIE emissive
product. More importantly, by utilizing such AIE property of the product,
a practical test strip with DATPE has been fabricated for sensitively
and selectively detecting trace amount of phosgene gas in air, which
renders it highly promising for development of a portable onsite test
kit for detecting phosgene gas. Moreover, these observations presented
in this work would offer some new sights into the molecular design
of AIE-based fluorescent sensors for phosgene.
