Silicon-oxide-nanoparticle (SiO2-NP) heteroatoms were
decorated/deposited onto multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) surface
to tune the properties of MWCNTs for electronic and magnetic applications.
To achieve this objective, SiO2-NPs and MWCNTs were prepared
and suspended together into toluene and heated at <100 °C
for the formation of MWCNTs/SiO2-NP nanocomposites. A change
in the microstructure, electronic, electrical, and magnetic behaviors
of MWCNT nanocomposites decorated/deposited with silicon content was
investigated using different techniques, viz., scanning electron microscopy,
X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
for structural, compositional, and electronic structure, while current–voltage
was used for electrical properties and field-dependent magnetization
and electron spin resonance techniques were used for magnetic properties.
The results indicated that SiO2-NPs adhered onto MWCNTs,
resulting in variation in the material conductivity with the Si-NP
content. The coercivity of MWCNT nanocomposites adhered with 1.5 atom
% Si-NPs (HC@40 K = 689 Oe) is higher
than that of those adhered with 5.75 atom % Si-NPs (HC@40 K = 357 Oe). In general, the results provide information
about the possibilities of tuning the electronic, electrical, and
magnetic properties of MWCNTs by adherence of SiO2-NPs
onto them. This tuning of material properties could be useful for
different electronic and magnetic device applications.

1 Introduction
Since their discovery
in 1991,1 single-walled
and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been materials of choice
for a variety of applications due to their unique physical and electrical
properties. The materials also possess properties that make them suitable
for fabrication of electrochemical sensors.2 Despite their potential for these applications, electronic, electrical,
and magnetic properties of CNTs need to be tailored for more different
device-based applications. Over few decades, significant progress
has been made by various researchers in exploring graphitic carbon
materials such as graphene, fullerene, and CNTs owing to their unique
properties for different applications.3−5 Zhang et al. explored
the CNT semiconductor composites and other carbon materials for photocatalytic
properties and their results showed a significant activity.5 Other studies also showed the possibility of
tuning the properties of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) by
introducing heteroatoms like nitrogen and boron.6

Theoretical studies have shown that in CNTs, Si atoms
relax outward
and form a sp3 bonding to change the electronic and magnetic
behaviors of the material.7 Silicon (Si)
atoms chemisorb on the surface of CNTs to provide dangling bonds that
change the properties of the material for different applications in
addition to the known ones.2,6 Silicon atoms can be
binding centers for various atoms or molecules, making CNTs easier
and more attractive for functionalization.8 Silicon, therefore, could be a preferred element to functionalize
CNTs due its large atomic size, which distorts the host lattice to
generate/induce defects in the material.

In comparison to other
dopants like nitrogen and boron, effects
of silicon on properties of CNTs have not been fully explained nor
understood. In comparison to theoretical studies, there is scarce
experimental data presented on CNTs deposited with Si nanoparticles
(NPs). In the present study, MWCNTs are a material of interest because
they have better properties than graphene and fullerene. Although
they have similar properties, graphene is a semiconductor with a zero
forbidden gap,9 while CNTs are metallic
or semiconductor with the forbidden gap ranging from 0 to 2 eV.10,11 The technique used in the production of CNTs has control over its
length, diameter, and morphology,12 which
have a great influence in tailoring their properties for preferred
applications. On the other hand, fullerene is a single-wall CNT (SWCNT)
with closed ends and have similar properties to those of MWCNTs. The
advantage of MWCNTs over SWCNT is that there is a possibility to produce
them in large quantity;12 hence, we studied
MWCNTs. We have synthesized MWCNT and deposited different concentrations
of Si-NPs on MWCNTs and studied their structural, electronic, electrical,
and magnetic properties using different spectroscopic techniques.
The Si-NPs got oxidized during the synthesis process to form silicon-oxide-nanoparticles
(SiO2-NPs) and adhered onto MWCNTs. Our motivation is that
due to the adherence of Si-NPs, MWCNTs are a potential candidate for
ferromagnetic and electromagnetic nanodevice applications. This motivation
is based on the data acquired using different material research techniques.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Surface Morphology
Surface morphologies
of SiO2-NPs, MWCNTs, and MWCNTs/SiO2-NP (Si-NPs
= 1.5 atom %) nanocomposites are shown in Figure 1a–c. Figure 1a shows small aggregates of SiO2-NPs, with size distribution varying from 50 to 100 nm. Figure 1b clearly indicates
the formation of MWCNTs with a uniform diameter with little contamination,
while Figure 1c confirms
the decoration/deposition of SiO2-NPs on the surface of
MWCNTs as indicated in the tree-buds-like structure on the anchored
branches. It can also be seen from the figure that SiO2-NPs are well-dispersed and bounded to the surface of MWCNTs. This
attachment and anchoring of SiO2-NPs to the surface of
MWCNTs is important for the variation of the electrical conductivity
of MWCNTs and for the prevention of an aggregation behavior of SiO2-NPs during the whole charging/discharging process among Si@C/CNTs
(mixture of Si@C and CNTs) and oxygen. This variation of conductivity
is shown later in the text. However, it is noted that as they were
exposed to air, the Si-NPs were oxidized during the synthesis process
to form SiO2-NPs on the surface of MWCNTs.

2.2 X-Ray Diffraction
Figure 1d shows the
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) spectra for all the synthesized nanocomposites. The spectrum
for MWCNTs show a prominent peak at 2θ ≈ 26° corresponding
to the (002) plane of the graphitic structure13 and less intense peaks at 2θ ≈ 44 and 53° corresponding
to the (100) and (004) reflection,13 respectively.
This structure matches with that of pristine MWCNTs and/or standard
graphite carbon, indicating a well-graphitized MWCNTs14 without carbonaceous impurities and/or catalytic metal
particles on the surface of the MWCNTs. The adherence of 1.5 atom
% Si onto MWCNTs results in an additional peak at 2θ ≈
78° corresponding to the (110) plane15 along with the (002), (100), and (004) planes, indicating that the
structure of MWCNT is still intact. However, when oxidized Si-NPs
(5.75 atom %) is adhered onto MWCNTs, these peaks disappeared, resulting
in two peaks at lower angles of 2θ ≈ 22 and 7°.
We assume that these two peaks may arise from SiO2/Si–O–C
and Si–Si structures respectively.16,17 Casati et al. found a peak at 2θ ≈ 6.5° in AlSi10Mg alloy and claimed that the peak arises from silicon and
is a reflection of Si (111),16 whereas
the peak at 2θ ≈ 22° is consistent with crystalline
SiO2 as previously reported by Svavarsson et al.17

2.3 Raman Spectroscopy
Figure 1e shows the
Raman spectra of
the synthesized SiO2-NPs, MWCNTs, and their nanocomposites.
A wide peak at ∼520 cm–1 observed for SiO2-NPs is attributed to the Si peak.18 In the case of MWCNTs, four main peaks observed at approximately
1345, 1585, 2693, and 2937 cm–1 correspond to the
D-band (disordered graphitic), G-band, 2D-band, and (D + G)-band,
respectively.19−23 The D-peak is due to defected graphite.19−23 The G-peak, on the other hand, has been found to
be due to the doubly degenerate zone centered around the E2g mode resulting from the stretching modes of C–C bonds of
typical graphite19 The 2D peak is an overtone
of the D peak and occurs due to a second-order vibration process,
and the D + G-peak occurs due to the combined vibration of D and G
modes. These four peaks were also observed when different oxidized
Si-NPs concentrations (1.5 and 5.75 atom %) were decorated/deposited
on the MWCNTs surface and are found to be shifted slightly toward
a lower wavelength for MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs (Si-NPs = 1.5 atom
%). In the case of MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs (5.75 atom %), a peak
representing SiO2 is observed in addition to four carbon
peaks of MWCNTs. The existence of a SiO2 peak in the Raman
spectra indicates that Si-NPs were oxidized to form SiO2-NPs on the surface of MWCNTs (Table 1). The peak may also be due to the relatively
high concentration of silicon atom onto MWCNTs. Thus, the measurements
may also confirm that SiO2-NPs have been deposited on MWCNTs
matrices. Presumably, the shift in the peak positions is consistent
with the shift in the XRD spectra, implying the formation of the MWCNTs/SiO2-NP nanocomposites. Due to the large surface area of silicon,24 the atom can easily create a bond length stretching,
which leads to a significant softening effect of the MWCNT/SiO2-NP composites.25 The adherence
of silicon also induces a low-frequency shift of the MWCNTs spectrum.
The first- and second-order Raman spectra deconvoluted into two Gaussian
lines for MWCNTs and MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs (Si-NPs = 1.5 atom
%) and three Gaussian lines for MWCNTs/SiO2-NP (Si-NPs
= 5.75 atom %) nanocomposites are shown in Figure 1f–h. The evaluated peak intensities
(int.), peak widths (Δω), and peak positions (x) of the deconvoluted spectra are presented in Table 2. It can be seen from
the table that the peak widths of D- and G-bands are low (narrow)
for MWCNTs/SiO2-NP composites. The narrowing of the peak
width is due to reduction of defects as a result of substitutional
SiO2 atoms. To understand the degree of crystallization
of the nanocomposites, ID/IG ratio was calculated from the deconvoluted Raman peaks.
The ID/IG ratios
are 1.3, 1.5, and 0.74 for MWCNTs, MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs (Si-NPs
= 1.5 atom %), and MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs (Si-NPs = 5.75 atom
%), respectively. The variation of the ratio indicates the degree
of disordered carbon atoms in the nanocomposites.19−23,26 The high ratio (ID/IG) of the nanocomposites
indicates a structural change of the composites. In MWCNTs, SiO2-NPs change the crystal structure of the composites. We have
estimated the crystallite size using the Tuinstra–Koenig relation27  where the energy difference “R” is the integrated intensity ratio ID/IG and E1 is the excitation laser energy (≈2.33 eV). The
crystallite size of MWCNTs/SiO2-NP (Si-NPs = 5.75 atom
%) nanocomposite is higher than that of pure MWCNTs as tabulated in Table 1. A change in La is due to oxidized silicon atoms relaxing
outward and forming a sp3 bond7 in the MWCNTs/SiO2-NP nanocomposite. This conjecture
is in good agreement with the XRD results as discussed above.

2.4 X-Ray Adsorption Near Edge Spectroscopy
The C K-edge X-ray adsorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) spectrum
in Figure 2a shows
that there is a transition from C 1s core to p-like final states above
the Fermi level (Ef). The spectrum also
shows the π* features that are associated with sp2-bonding configurations at ∼285.5 (±0.1) eV28,29 and σ* features at ∼292.8 eV. The π* region was
subtracted within the range of 284–289 eV using a Gaussian
line and is shown as an inset in Figure 2a. The inset shows double structural features
centered at ∼285.5 (±0.1) and 287.1 eV for MWCNTs and
MWCNTs/SiO2-NP nanocomposites, respectively. The intensity
of pure MWCNT is found to be higher than that of MWCNT/SiO2-NP (Si-NPs = 5.75 atom %) and lower than the intensity of MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs (Si-NPs = 1.5 atom %). As suggested elsewhere,30 these features in the π* region may indicate
that C–H or Si–C(:H) or Si–C(:O) and sp2 C–C bonds have been formed. Effects of Si–C(:H) and/or
Si–C(:O) bonding on the electronic structure of MWCNTs is confirmed
by the difference in the intensities of the nanocomposites. These
results indicate that the MWCNTs changes the near-edge unoccupied
C 2p states upon SiO2-NPs decoration/deposition on the
surface of MWCNTs, causing their structural/electronic properties
to change. The normalized O K-edge XANES spectra of the nanocomposites
in Figure 2b show several
peaks at ∼529 and ∼531 eV and a double structure at
∼533/∼535 eV in the π* region. The origin of the
peaks at ∼529 and ∼531 eV is attributed to bond resonance
transitions from carboxylic groups and hydroxyl groups.31 The observed double structure peaks at ∼533
and 535 eV in each O K-edge spectra were assigned to the physisorbed
O232 that may occur during the
nanocomposite synthesis process. The peak at ∼540.5 eV for
MWCNTs is assigned to σ*30 and is
shifted to ≈0.4 eV toward the lower energy for MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs, indicating that the oxidized Si-NPs interacted with
C and O in MWCNTs. The subtracted background shown as an inset of Figure 2b indicates that
the intensity of MWCNTs is higher than that of MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs (Si-NPs = 5.75 atom %) and lower than that of MWCNTs/SiO2-NP (Si-NPs = 1.5 atom %) nanocomposites. This variation of
intensities indicates that O 2p and Si 3p states are coupled in MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs. Figure 2c shows the normalized Si L3,2-edge XANES spectra of SiO2-NPs and MWCNTs/SiO2-NP composites. Spectral features,
A and B, in Figure 2c for MWCNTs and MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs are separated by ∼2.0
eV. Feature A shows a splitting of 1.0 eV, indicating a poor resolved
features at ∼104 and 105 eV.33 The
double split of A might be a spin–orbit doublet due to the
transition of Si 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 core states
to the antibonding Si 3s derived states.33 The feature B, on the other hand, can be explained in terms of the
Si 2p-to-3p transition and/or is associated with the resulted Si 3s
or 3d derived states from hybridization with O 2p orbitals.33,34 Both spectral features are shifted slightly toward the lower energy,
indicating that the electronic structure of MWCNTs changed due to
the incorporation of SiO2-NPs in the MWCNTs matrice.

2.5 X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
The chemical
states of carbon/oxygen/silicon atoms in nanocomposites
is shown by C 1s, O 1s, and Si 2sp X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) spectra in Figure 3. Table 1 presents
the elemental composition (C, O, and Si), quantification (atom %)
and the weight percentage (wt %) obtained from XPS measurements. Quantificational
analysis of C, O, and Si in MWCNT composites are explained in terms
of the data presented in Table 1. It can be observed from the table that carbon/oxygen atoms
are replaced/substituted by oxidized Si-NPs atoms. C 1s, O 1s, and
Si 2sp XPS spectra were deconvoluted into different Gaussian lines
(see Figure 3), and
their different parameters are tabulated in Table 3. C 1s peak observed at ∼283.5/284.4
eV (peak I/peak II) for MWCNTs in Figure 3b is assigned to the C=C bond (carbon
sp2-hybridization). This peak is shifted toward higher
energy at ∼285.3 eV for the low concentration of oxidized Si-NPs
(1.5 atom %) deposited MWCNTs and is shown in Figure 3c. This peak is known as a “defect
peak”35 or a Si–C–O
bonding peak,36 indicating a change in
structural and electronic behavior of the composites due to SiO2-NPs deposition. The peaks at 288.8/289.5 eV for MWCNTs and
MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs (Si-NPs = 1.5 atom %), arise from >C–O/–COOH
bonds and/or along with Si bonds. The C 1s peak of oxidized Si-NPs
decorated MWCNTs shifts towards a lower energy, significantly indicating
the formation of sp3-rich material. The deconvoluted C
1s XPS peaks of MWCNTs/SiO2-NP (Si-NPs = 5.75 atom %) nanocomposites
are observed at ∼281.8 and ∼282.4 eV which are strong
indicators of the C–Si bonds,37 and
confirm the formation of MWCNTs/SiO2-NP nanocomposites.

MWCNTs spectrum shows two de-convoluted O 1s peaks
at 530.5 and
at 531.9 eV assigned to C=O and C–O, respectively. The
two subpeaks at 533.3 and 532.7 eV for MWCNTs/SiO2-NP nanocomposites
are due to the O–C and O–Si groups, respectively.38 The Si 2p and 2s XPS spectra of Figure 3i show the main peaks at ∼100
and ∼150 eV, respectively, for Si-NPs. These XPS spectra for
Si 2p and 2s are also observed in Figure 3j–l for MWCNTs/SiO2-NP
nanocomposites with different peak positions. Different decomposed
peaks between ∼99.0 and 102 eV for Si 2p are assigned to Si–C/Si–C–O
and that at ∼103.0 eV to Si–O.37−39 The peaks at
∼151.1–153.0 eV range for Si 2s XPS spectra are Si–Si
peaks and those above 153.0 eV are assigned to Si–O.40 These results clearly indicate that SiO2-NPs are responsible for the change in the electronic and
bonding structure of the MWCNT/SiO2-NP composites. Based
on the XPS decomposed peak intensity, it can be hypothesized that
SiO2-NPs are responsible for the change in structural properties
of MWCNTs and can make a material rich in sp3. This hypothesis
is confirmed by the data acquired from the Raman spectra.

2.6 Current–Voltage (I–V) Measurement
Figure 4a shows that the ohmic I–V relationship is more pronounced
for MWCNT. The results in Figure 4b,c also show that in MWCNTs, SiO2-NPs are
responsible for the change in conductivity of the composites. As the
concentration of the deposited SiO2-NPs increases, the I–V tends to deviate from ohmic
to nonohmic behavior with a slight decrease in the electrical conductivity
of the composites from conducting to semiconducting. The increase
in conductivity of MWCNTs/SiO2 (Si-NPs = 1.5 atom %) is
due to a dangling bond formed in MWCNTs due to decreased silicon content.41 The bond creates levels in the forbidden gap
of the material that generate charge carriers to contribute to the
measured current. On the other hand, a slight decrease in the electrical
conductivity may be due to the change in the electrical structure
of MWCNTs. The I–V hysteresis
loops for MWCNTs and MWCNTs/SiO2-NP nanocomposites are
shown in Figure 4d–f.
Unlike in the case of MWCNTs and MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs (Si-NPs
= 1.5 atom %), a small I–V hysteresis loop is observed for MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs (Si-NPs
= 5.75 atom %), indicating a charge storage property of these composites.
The loop area of the first cycle is higher than that of the second
cycle, signifying a Coulombic blockade and an electron–hole
recombination, which is consistent with the silicon single-electron
transistor.42Figure 4e,f shows that the loop for MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs (Si-NPs = 5.75 atom %) has an area larger than that for
the MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs (Si-NPs = 1.5 atom %). The larger hysteresis
loop indicates that the material has a high charge storage behavior.
Based on the current (conductivity) variation of MWCNTs with the oxidized
Si-NPs concentration, we can hypothesize that the material could be
useful for ferroelectric device applications.

2.7 M–H Hysteresis Loops
The
magnetic-field-dependent M–H hysteresis loops of the synthesized composites
are presented in Figure 5a–d. In Figure 5a,b, a paramagnetic behavior is observed for SiO2-NPs,
whereas pure MWCNTs show a ferromagnetic behavior. Considering Figure 5c,d, the magnetization
of MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs (Si-NPs = 1.5 atom %) increases slightly
but decreases for MWCNTs/SiO2-NP (Si-NPs = 5.75 atom %)
nanocomposites. These results indicate that ferromagnetic behavior
gets suppressed as the concentration of SiO2-NPs in MWCNTs
increase. The hysteresis loops measured at 40 and 300 K are used to
explain this variation of the magnetization, and different magnetization
parameters are tabulated in Table 4. The structural change of MWCNTs can be explained
in terms of variation of magnetization (MS). The reduction of MS is due to the
formation of Si–C bonding along with Si–O, making the
material rich in sp3. The interaction of silicon atoms
with other elements in MWCNTs has been explained elsewhere with possibilities
of reducing sp2 while increasing sp3 hybridization.40,43

2.8 Zero Field Cooling and
Field Cooling
The temperature dependence of zero field cooling
(ZFC) and field
cooling (FC) measurements of SiO2-NPs, MWCNTs, and MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs are presented in Figure 5e–g. The figure shows that MWCNTs and MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs have ferromagnetic features and thus are in agreement
with the ferromagnetic behavior observed in the M–H hysteresis loops. This study reveals that
the oxidized Si-NPs are responsible for the semiconducting magnetic
behavior of MWCNTs. This ability to control the structural behavior
of MWCNTs by manipulating their structure opens new vistas for more
electronic and spintronic devices. As a low toxicity material, the
ability to control the properties of MWCNTs also gives room for applications
in biomedicine.

2.9 Electron Spin Resonance
Figure 5i–l
shows
the ferromagnetism behavior of the nanocomposites using electron spin
resonance (ESR) technique at room temperature. A prominent resonant
microwave absorption signal (Hr) is observed
at around 3200 G/1600 G for high/low field in the figure. The linewidth
(ΔH) of ESR signals are 367/203, 433/190, 711/117,
and 1284/148 for Si-NPs, MWCNTs, MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs (Si-NPs
= 1.5 atom %), and MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs (Si-NPs = 5.75 atom
%) in high/low field, respectively. Parameters calculated from the
ESR spectra are presented in Table 5. The g-value (Landé g factor) or Δg/g value changes with the deposition of SiO2-NPs on MWCNTs
surface. From Table 5, the linewidth with an effective g value for MWCNTs/SiO2-NP (Si-NPs = 1.5 atom %) nanocomposites is higher than that
for pure SiO2-NPs, MWCNTs, and MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs
(Si-NPs = 5.75 atom %), indicating that MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs
(Si-NPs = 1.5 atom %) have a higher magnetic phase in MWCNTs.44 Similar values have been reported elsewhere
for other forms of carbon.45 A possible
overlap of the broad linewidth with resonance line of an unpaired
electron that is trapped in an oxygen vacancy in MWCNTs makes Hr to shift toward the lower field for the g-value greater than 2. Majchrzycki et al.46 have reported similar results on functionalized graphene
materials. The asymmetric factor (Pasy) was estimated using the relation Pasy = (1 – hu/hl),47 where hu and hl are the upper and lower
peak heights, respectively, from zero line. It was observed that Pasy increases gradually with an increase of
oxidized Si-NPs content in MWCNTs, as shown in Table 5. The highest magnetic anisotropy was obtained
for MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs (Si-NPs = 1.5 atom %). The total number
of spin (N) regarding the ESR resonance was calculated
using the following relation: N = 0.285 × Ip–p × (ΔH)2,48 where Ip–p is the peak-to-peak height of the ESR signal
(in au) and ΔH is the linewidth in Gauss. The
Δg/g and N values are high in the case of MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs (Si-NPs
= 1.5 atom %) nanocomposites leading to a high value of magnetization.
These results confirm that the MWCNTs/SiO2-NP (Si-NPs =
1.5 atom %) nanocomposites can preserve the magnetism as MWCNTs that
could be very useful for electromagnetic applications.

As
observed from Raman spectra, the sp2 content is higher
in MWCNTs/SiO2-NP (Si-NPs = 1.5 atom %) and lower in MWCNTs/SiO2-NP (Si-NPs = 5.75 atom %) composites than in pure MWCNTs,
thereby giving rise to sp3 content for 5.75 atom % oxidized
Si-NP-deposited MWCNTs. This observation is consistent with XPS and
XANES data. The XPS spectra for pure MWCNTs show that the sp2 C=C peak at ∼284.4 eV shifted toward a high binding
energy, thereby forming a defect peak at 285.3 eV with a decrease
in the intensity of the MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs. This defected
peak is ∼0.9 eV higher than that of pure MWCNTs. The weak attachment
bond of MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs (Si-NPs = 1.5 atom %) on the surface
of MWCNTs can be attributed to this defected peak. The increase/decrease
in the intensity of C K-edge XANES spectra correspond to a increase/decrease
in the ID/IG ratio, indicating a change in structural/electronic nature of MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs. The observed change in the structural/electronic properties
of MWCNTs due to the deposition of SiO2-NPs (Si-NPs = 1.5
atom %) content leads to the formation of the Si–C–O
and C–O/–COOH bonds due to oxygen (O) vacancy created,
which may be responsible for the higher magnetization. The presence
of oxygen functional group creates a positive center, which captures
an electron in a localized form.49,50 The local
electrons possess magnetic moments that improve the magnetism in MWCNTs/SiO2-NP (Si-NPs = 1.5 atom %) nanocomposites. The strong interaction
(tetrahedral bonding Si–C) between the atoms of Si and C may
be responsible for the rapid decrease in the magnetization of MWCNTs
due to an increase in the SiO2-NPs content.40 The relationship between the electrical and
magnetic properties of MWCNT:SiO2-NPs can be clarified
by the transport properties of the MWCNTs/SiO2-NP nanocomposites.
The ferromagnetism induced in MWCNT/SiO2-NPs was also based
on the delocalized electrons not trapped by O vacancy.50 The magnetic and electrical properties are mainly
due to the mobility of electrons between the atoms. The delocalized
electrons allow for easy transition between the valence and the conduction
bands, leading to an enhancement in electrical conductivity.51 In addition, the delocalized electrons also
enhance the exchange interaction of atoms, which eventually improves
the ferromagnetic behavior of MWCNT/SiO2-NP nanocomposites.50,52

3 Conclusions
The electrical, electronic,
and magnetic behaviors of the synthesized
MWCNTs and MWCNTs/SiO2-NP nanocomposites have been investigated.
We observed that there is a change in the structure of MWCNTs from
sp2- to sp3-rich hybridized carbon atoms with
a change in the electrical conductivity of MWCNTs due to the deposition/decoration
of SiO2-NPs on the surface of MWCNTs. The formation of
Si–C, Si–Si, and Si–O–C/Si–O bonding
features was observed, indicating that SiO2-NPs impacted
the chemical bonding and electronic structure of MWCNTs. The magnetization
of MWCNTs varies as a function of oxidized Si-NPs content adhered
onto the surface of MWCNTs lattice. We therefore conclude that the
deposition/decoration of oxidized Si-NPs on the surface of MWCNTs
is an alternative method to tailor the structural, electrical, and
magnetic properties of MWCNTs for future electronic and magnetic device
applications.

4 Experimental Details
4.1 Synthesis Process
Spray pyrolysis
process was used to prepare MWCNTs using a solution of ferrocene (C10H10Fe as a catalyst) and toluene (C7H8 as a carbon source),53 whereas
thermal decomposition process was used for the synthesis of silicon
nanoparticles (SiO2-NPs) using chloro(dimethyl) octadecylsilane
in 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene in the presence of octadecylamine.54 Since the synthesis process of the nanocomposites
was carried out in an atmospheric pressure, Si-NPs were oxidized to
form SiO2-NP. For the preparation of MWCNT:SiO2-NPs composites, we used SiO2-NPs and MWCNTs at two different
stoichiometric ratios (Si-NPs = 1.5 atom % and Si-NPs = 5.75 atom
%), which were suspended in toluene and heated at above 100 °C
to obtain MWCNTs/SiO2-NP nanocomposites. The deposited
SiO2-NPs have been found to be possibly deposited on the
MWCNTs matrices.

4.2 Measurements
SiO2-NPs,
MWCNTs, and MWCNTs/SiO2-NP nanocomposites were characterized
by the use of different techniques to establish and study the change
in their surface morphology, microstructure, electronic, and magnetic
properties due to the deposition of SiO2-NPs in the MWCNT
lattice. The deposited SiO2-NPs on MWCNTs were denoted
as MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs (Si-NPs = 1.5 atom %) and MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs (Si-NPs = 5.75 atom %) translating to 1.5% and 5.57 atom
% of Si-NPs concentration in MWCNTs, respectively. The SiO2-NPs, MWCNTs, and MWCNTs/SiO2-NPs was drop-cast on a silicon
substrate and air-dried overnight prior to measurements. All measurements
were performed at room temperature except magnetic measurements. To
obtain the surface morphology of SiO2-NPs, MWCNTs, and
MWCNTs/SiO2-NP nanocomposites, field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM) images were recorded using a JSM-7800F
FESEM from JEOL Ltd. coupled with an UltraDry EDS detector. The structural
studies of the synthesized composites were performed using a Rigaku
Smartlab X-ray diffractometer (0.154 nm Cu Kα line). Raman spectra
were recorded using a HORIBA scientific XploRA at 532 nm (∼2.41
eV) LASER light excitation energy. The surface morphological structures
were studied using JEOL JEM 2100. The C K-edge, O K-edge, and Si L3,2-edge XANES measurements were performed at the Taiwan Light
Source (TLS), Hsinchu, Taiwan. The core shells C 1s, O 1s, and Si
2sp were performed using a KRATOS-SUPRA spectrometer with a monochromatic
Al Kα radiation possessing an excitation energy, hν = 1486.6 eV, and a base pressure 1.2 × 10–9 Torr at UNISA (Florida Science Campus). The electrical conductivity
was studied using Keithley 6487 with a voltage sweep ranging from
−0.6 to +0.6 V. In this measurements, silver paste was used
as the conducting electrodes to investigate the electrical behavior
of the materials. The range voltage of 0–+0.6 V, +0.6–0
V, 0––0.6 V, and −0.6–0 V was used to
obtain the I–V data. The
value of 0.6 V was the highest voltage applied for the current limit
of 2.5 mA. A SQUID-type magnetometer with a sensitivity of <5 ×
10–8 emu was used for the M–H loop and FC/ZFC measurements. All the measurements were
performed at room temperature. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra
were recorded using a Bruker EMX spectrometer at 9.45 GHz. Details
of these measurement techniques are available elsewhere.55
