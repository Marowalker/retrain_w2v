We developed a high-power
abiotic direct glucose fuel cell system
using a Au–Pt bimetallic anode catalyst. The high power generation
(95.7 mW cm–2) was attained by optimizing operating
conditions such as the composition of a bimetallic anode catalyst,
loading amount of the metal catalyst on a carbon support, ionomer/carbon
weight ratio when the catalyst was applied to the anode, glucose and
KOH concentrations in the fuel solution, and operating temperature
and flow rate of the fuel solution. It was found that poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-stabilized Au80Pt20 nanoparticles (mean diameter 1.5 nm) on a carbon (Ketjen
Black 600) support function as a highly active anode catalyst for
the glucose electrooxidation. The ionomer/carbon weight ratio also
greatly affects the cell properties, which was found to be optimal
at 0.2. As for the glucose concentration, a maximum cell power was
derived at 0.4–0.6 mol dm–3. A high KOH concentration
(4.0 mol dm–3) was preferable for deriving the maximum
power. The cell power increased with the increasing flow rate of the
glucose solution up to 50 cm3 min–1 and
leveled off thereafter. At the optimal condition, the maximum power
density and corresponding cell voltage of 58.2 mW cm–2 (0.36 V) and 95.7 mW cm–2 (0.34 V) were recorded
at 298 and 328 K, respectively.

==== Body
Introduction
Currently, there is
an urgent demand on the circumvention from
global warming.1 For this purpose, a rapid
change of energy sources from fossil fuels to clean and sustainable
ones is indispensable. Glucose is one of the most abundantly available
clean fuels, derivable by degradation of polysaccharides, for example,
starch and cellulose.2 Moreover, glucose
is a safe (nonhazardous, nonvolatile, and biocompatible) energy source
bearing a large inherent chemical energy, which can be released with
the oxidation (2.87 MJ mol–1 or 15.9 kJ g–1 for the complete oxidation to carbon dioxide and water).3

Direct glucose fuel cell (DGFC) operates
with the oxidation of
glucose at the anode and the reduction of oxygen at the cathode.4      

The DGFC can be classified into three categories:5 enzymatic,6−12 microbial,13−15 and abiotic systems.16−23 Each system has advantages. For instance, enzymatic and microbial
systems have a high specificity for the substrate, which enables to
construct separator-free fuel cell systems. Abiotic systems can work
at harsh pH and temperature conditions. However, there is a severe
issue in common with all these systems, that is, low current density
(<10 mW cm–2 in most cases), which impedes wide
applications of DGFC.24,25 As such, their current application
targets are limited to a power supply for implantable medical devices3,26−28 and mobile electronic devices.29 The low current density is partly due to a partial oxidation
of glucose, that is, at conventional operating conditions only two
electrons can be derived with the oxidation of glucose to gluconic
acid in place of 24 electrons for the complete oxidation to CO2 and H2O,3 but presumably
it is not the all.

When confined to abiotic DGFC systems using
metal catalysts, the
cell performance can be affected by the following factors: (i) nature
of the supported metal catalyst, (ii) concentration and pH of the
glucose fuel solution, and (iii) operating condition of the fuel cell.
The nature of the supported metal catalyst involves the size, shape,
and composition of the metal nanoparticles, nature of the support,
nature of the stabilizer if used, and dispersity of the metal catalyst
on the support surface. Besides, in many cases, conductive polymers
called ionomers are employed for the electric contact between the
supported catalyst and the electrode (in particular, the anode), which
can also influence the cell properties. The operating condition of
the fuel cell involves the flow rate and operation temperature. For
generation of high power density, all these parameters should be optimized.

To improve the power of the DGFC system, we previously reported
that the concentration of a stabilizer for protecting metal nanoparticles
from aggregation is crucial for their electrocatalytic properties.30 There is an optimal stabilizer concentration,
below which the current density decreased because of aggregation of
the catalyst, whereas above which the current density also decreased
because of that the stabilizer in excess coats the catalyst surface
and impedes the approach of fuel molecules.

Regarding the anode
catalyst, we focused our attention to the Au–Pt
system among many bimetallic systems.31−37 This is due to excellent electrocatalytic properties of monometallic
Au and Pt in terms of high power density and durability. Several studies
on the Au–Pt bimetallic system have been reported. Comotti
et al. studied the catalytic activity of nonsupported and carbon-supported
Au–Pt bimetallic nanoparticles and found the highest catalytic
activity at Au/Pt = 2:1 (d = 2.8 nm from X-ray diffraction)
for both systems.31 Zhang and Toshima synthesized
poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP)-stabilized Au–Pt bimetallic nanoparticles
with different compositions by alcohol or NaBH4 reduction.32 They investigated the catalytic properties of
the unsupported bimetallic nanoparticles and found the highest activity
for glucose oxidation per total metal at Au80Pt20 (d = 1.6 nm) and that the bimetallic nanoparticles
have a Pt-rich shell structure. They also reported that the Au–Pt
bimetallic nanoparticles with a crown-jewel structure exhibit an extraordinary
high catalytic activity for glucose oxidation.33 Regarding the fuel cell properties utilizing glucose oxidation,
Basu and Basu studied Pt–Au, Pt–Ru, and Pt–Bi
bimetallic systems and concluded that the Pt–Au system provides
the highest power and stability.34 They
reported 0.9 V and 0.72 mW cm–2 for the open-circuit
voltage (OCV) and the maximum power density, respectively, as the
fuel performance using Au–Pt supported on Vulcan XC-72 carbon
as the anode catalyst and charcoal as the cathode working with 0.2
M glucose in 1 M KOH solution.35 Habrioux
et al. synthesized Au–Pt bimetallic nanoparticles in microemulsion
systems and supported also on Vulcan XC-72 carbon to investigate fuel
cell properties.36 They found the highest
electrocatalytic activity for Au80Pt20 (d = 5.02 ± 0.56 nm) working with a biocathode (ABTS
+ laccase) in phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) at 37 °C. Their maximum
peak density of the fuel cell reported is 16 μW cm–2 at 0.16 V and 100 μA cm–2.37,38

Herein, we first revisit the optimal bimetallic composition
of
the Au–Pt system by cyclic voltammetry (CV), followed by the
optimization of other conditions, that is, materials’ conditions
(metal loading, ionomer, glucose, and base concentrations) and operating
conditions (flow rate of the fuel solution and operating temperature).
Consequently, we are successful to produce a high current density
(∼100 mW cm–2) which has been rarely attained
for the DGFC system in previous studies.

Results and Discussion
Charge
Flow in the Present DGFC
In this DGFC system,
a pair of graphite plates were used as an anode and a cathode, and
a monovalent cation permeable membrane (CPM) was employed as a separator
between the two electrodes. The flow of electronic and ionic charges
is illustrated in Figure 1. On the anode, glucose molecules are oxidized to gluconolactone,
and it further undergoes hydrolysis in solution to gluconic acid.
During this process, two electrons are liberated and migrate to the
cathode through the external circuit. At the same time, two protons
are generated, but they rapidly dissipate by reacting with hydroxyl
ions to yield water molecules because the fuel solution contains a
high concentration of KOH. Accordingly, few protons migrate through
the CPM, whereas potassium cations and electrically neutral water
molecules can migrate though the CPM toward the cathode because a
concentrated KOH solution was used as an electrolyte. On the other
hand, on the cathode, atmospheric oxygen molecules are reduced by
the electrons and combining with water to yield hydroxyl anions.

electronic and ionic charges in this DGFC system.

Composition of the Bimetallic Anode Catalyst
In general,
the catalytic properties of bimetallic nanoparticles are influenced
by geometric factors (surface area38 and
crystal facet39,40) and electronic factors (surface
metal composition).41 Therefore, the size
and composition of synthesized nanoparticles were analyzed with transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS).
As shown in the TEM images of Figure 2, before depositing on the carbon support, most nanoparticles
were individually dispersed without forming aggregates for all Au–Pt
bimetallic compositions. Interestingly, we found a trend that the
mean diameter decreases with the increasing Au fraction in the Au–Pt
bimetallic systems from 2.7 to 1.4 nm (Figure S1), although the total metal concentration (0.2 mmol dm–3) and the reductant concentration (2.0 mmol dm–3) were identical in all systems. This can be attributed
to a difference in the surface energy of the two metal elements,42 which affects the aggregation between the nuclei
of nanoparticles and the adsorption of stabilizer molecules. If we
calculate the fraction of surface atoms being responsible for the
catalytic reaction, it leads to a large variation from 64 to 92%,
as listed in Table 1. This variation should be taken into account for their electrocatalytic
properties. When the PVP-stabilized metal nanoparticles were deposited
on the carbon support, the particle size was maintained. However,
the deposition was not homogeneous, that is, there were some variations
in the number density of deposited nanoparticles depending on the
place of the carbon support (Figure S2).
This is probably related to a strong hydrophobic attraction force
between the metal nanoparticles and carbon support. Accordingly, in
addition to the effect of surface area for different metal compositions,
there may also be a substantial effect of heterogeneous deposition
of the catalyst on the support. By contrast, no significant variation
was found in the bimetallic composition depending on the particle
size, as proved from EDS point analysis (Figure S3). Moreover, the EDS line analysis for individual nanoparticles
showed no significant difference in the signal intensity at the central
part and the peripheral part of a given nanoparticle, verifying homogeneous
composition (Figure S4). Although there
is a difference in the redox potential between Au3+/Au0 (E0 = 1.00 V) and Pt4+/Pt0 (0.71 V),41 it does not
necessarily lead to phase separation. Either the alloy formation or the phase separation depends on the power of
a reducing agent.43−49 Because we employed here sodium borohydride (NaBH4) bearing
a strong reducing power, reduction of the two metal ions (Pt4+ and Au3+) to the metallic state was completed prior to
the electron transfer from Pt(0) or Pt2+ to Au3+ or Au+, thus Au–Pt alloy nanoparticles were produced.

Regarding
the surface metal composition, UV–vis extinction
spectra provide some information. Figure 3 presents the UV–visible extinction
spectra of the Au–Pt bimetallic nanoparticles dispersed in
water. The pure Au nanoparticles showed a shoulder at 520 nm, which
can be attributed to a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)
band. Whereas for the pure Pt nanoparticles, the extinction spectra
monotonically increased toward shorter wavelengths without a distinct
peak.50 Note that the remarkable increase
in the extinction below 240 nm is ascribed to PVP. In the Au–Pt
bimetallic systems, the extinction spectra continuously evolved between
those of the two monometallic systems. However, unlike the mixture
of the nanoparticle dispersions of the two metal elements (not shown),
the present samples showed a strong attenuation of the LSPR band of
Au even at a small Pt content (e.g., Au90Pt10), which suggests the presence of Pt atoms at the surface of all
nanoparticles.43

Figure 3 UV–visible extinction
spectra of aqueous Au–Pt bimetallic
nanoparticle dispersions. Total metal conc. = 0.2 mmol dm–3. PVP (0.2 mmol dm–3) is present as a stabilizer.

In the following, the electrocatalytic
properties of the Au–Pt
nanoparticles for glucose oxidation were investigated from CV. Figure 4 depicts CV profiles
associated with glucose electrooxidation at Au–Pt catalyst
systems of different compositions. For the pure Pt system (a), in
the reference (0.2 mol dm–3 KOH without glucose),
a single peak was observed each for anodic and cathodic scans. The
oxidation peak at −0.2 V (vs Ag|AgCl) and the reduction peak
at −0.3 V correspond to the oxidation of Pt to Pt–OH
and the reduction of Pt–OH to Pt, respectively.51,52 In the presence of 0.1 mol dm–3 glucose, two oxidation
peaks were observed with the anodic scan, a small hump at −0.2
V and a more distinct peak at 0.15 V. These peaks are associated with
the oxidation of glucose on the oxidized Pt surface.51,52 Although it is not apparent here, another oxidation peak could have
been observed at a lower potential (∼−0.7 V) because
of dehydrogenative adsorption of glucose on the Pt surface51,52 1

for glucose electrooxidation with (a) Pt,
(b) Au, (c) Au50Pt50, (d) Au70Pt30, (e) Au80Pt20, and (f) Au90Pt10 bimetallic catalysts. [KOH] = 0.2 mol dm–3, scan rate = 20 mV s–1.

Because this reaction takes place at low potential where
the Pt
surface is not oxidized, the hydrogen atom dissociated from the glucose
molecule is adsorbed on the Pt surface. However, the hydrogen atom
is immediately converted to a proton with the release of an electron
and combines with OH– in the solution51,52 2   3   4  

On the other hand, the dehydrogenated
glucose is oxidized to yield
gluconate, which adsorbs to the Pt or Pt–O surface, by forming
a monodendate or a bidentate intermediate, depending on the potential52 5   6  

These intermediates readily desorb as δ-gluconolactone
and
undergo hydrolysis in the solution to yield gluconate.

At high
potential, the adsorbed dehydrogenated glucose is directly
oxidized to δ-gluconolactone42 7  

The δ-gluconolactone readily desorbs
from the Pt surface
and undergoes hydrolysis to yield gluconate 8  

During the cathodic scan, a weak cathodic peak
was observed at
−0.20 V, which can be assigned to the reduction of δ-gluconolactone
to glucose.52

In the pure Au system
(b), in the absence of glucose, an oxidation
peak of Au and a reduction of Au–OH were observed at 0.2 and
0.1 V for anodic and cathodic scans, respectively.53−56 In the presence of glucose, a
remarkable increase of the current with glucose adsorption was set
in at −0.4 V on the anodic scan, which continued up to −0.2
V where a small shoulder was observed. After that, the current further
increased, and after passing a peak at 0.2 V, it decreased. The two
peaks can be ascribed to the dehydrogenative adsorption of glucose
on the Au–OH surface and oxidation to gluconolactone, respectively.53−56 While here in the course of the cathodic scan, a prominent oxidation
peak was observed at 0.2 V. This potential agrees with that of the
oxidation peak in the anodic scan in the absence of glucose. Accordingly,
this peak can be assigned to the oxidation of glucose, which simultaneously
proceeds with the reduction of Au=O to Au–OH.53−56 Another interpretation for the anodic peak during the cathodic scan
is the oxidation of glucose by a reactive oxygen species (O2–) generated with the reduction of the Au–OH surface.53

CV profiles of Au–Pt bimetallic
systems were compared in
(c–f). In the absence of glucose, a very weak peak or shoulder
was observed in the range of −0.1 to 0.0 V, an intermediate
potential between the oxidation potentials of pure Pt and pure Au.
While regarding the reduction peak, two very broad and weak peaks
are discernible at around 0.3 and −0.4 V. On the other hand,
in the presence of glucose, in all bimetallic compositions except
Au80Pt20, a single peak was observed at 0.2
V. Meanwhile, in Au80Pt20, three peaks were
observed at −0.25, 0.20, and 0.35 V. The apparent difference
in the shape of CV profiles is reminiscent of the effect of the crystal
surface of Au electrodes.40 Namely, the
CV profile for Au80Pt20 and slightly Au100 resembles well that for the glucose electrooxidation on
the Au{200} surface and the rest is similar to the CV profile on the
Au{111} surface.40 In addition, both the
peak potential and the relative values of current density are in good
agreement with the literature.40 Accordingly,
one of the reasons for a large glucose oxidation current on Au80Pt20 might be exposure of highly active {200}
surfaces. On the other hand, during the cathodic scan, a sharp oxidation
peak was observed at 0.20 V in all bimetallic compositions, similar
to the pure Au system. The increasing peak intensity is consistent
with the Au content in the bimetallic systems.

Figure 5 depicts
the net current density by glucose oxidation in Au–Pt bimetallic
systems, where the net current density was calculated by subtracting
the current density in the absence of glucose from that in the presence
of glucose. The onset of the current increase is accompanied with
the dehydrogenative adsorption of glucose molecules on the metal surface.
As shown, the onset potential is remarkably dependent on the bimetallic
composition. In particular, the onset potentials at Au80Pt20 are lower than those at other compositions. The lower
onset potential implies the smaller overpotential required for the
glucose oxidation, thus the greater cell voltage can be expected in
the fuel cell. Besides, the Au80Pt20 system
provides a significantly large oxidation peak current compared with
other bimetallic compositions. Accordingly, the Au80Pt20 system is the optimal composition for serving as the anode
of the DGFC system, thus we used this bimetallic catalyst hereafter.

density by glucose oxidation on Au–Pt bimetallic
catalysts with different compositions. [Glucose] = 0.1 mol dm–3, [KOH] = 0.2 mol dm–3, scan rate
= 20 mV s–1.

Ionomer/Carbon Weight Ratio
In liquid fuel cell systems,
conductive polymers called ionomers are often used for making an electric
contact between the catalyst support and the electrode.57 In this case, it is readily inferred that the
cell properties are dependent on the concentration of the ionomer. Figure 6 shows the CV profiles
for different ionomer (Nafion) concentrations. Virtually, the cell
power is strongly dependent on the ionomer concentration. The maximum
power density was recorded at the ionomer/carbon weight ratio (referred
to as I/C ratio) being 0.2. A too low concentration of the ionomer
makes it difficult to form a sufficient electric contact between the
catalyst support and the electrode, whereas a too high concentration
of the ionomer might cover the entire surface of the metal catalyst
on the support and impedes the approach of the reaction substrate
to the catalyst. Therefore, the I/C ratio was fixed hereafter at 0.2.

of the ionomer/carbon ratio on the I–W characteristics of DGFC. [Glucose] = 0.4 mol dm–3, [KOH] = 4.0 mol dm–3, flow rate of glucose solution
= 10 cm3 min–1.

Loading Amount of the Anode Catalyst
Figure 7 shows the variation of cell
power with a loading amount of the anode catalyst. As can be seen,
the cell power increased with an increase in the loading amount of
the catalyst up to 2.0 mg cm–2, but it decreased
at higher loadings. Visually, at higher loadings, the catalyst ink
stacked on the surface of the carbon cloth anode and the catalyst
surface was less exposed to the contact with fuel molecules. Accordingly,
all experiments were performed hereafter at 2.0 mg cm–2 of the anode catalyst loaded on the anode.

Figure 7 Variation of the power
of DGFC with a loading amount of the anode
catalyst. [Glucose] = 0.4 mol dm–3, [KOH] = 4.0
mol dm–3, flow rate of glucose solution = 10 cm3 min–1.

Glucose Concentration in the Fuel Solution
Subsequently,
the effect of glucose concentration on the cell power was investigated. Figure 8a shows that the
cell power increased with the increasing glucose concentration up
to 0.4–0.6 mol dm–3, whereas at higher fuel
concentrations, the cell power decreased significantly. On the other
hand, the I–V profiles (Figure 8b) indicate that
the cell voltage hardly changed with the glucose concentration up
to 1.0 mol dm–3 and decreased at higher concentrations.
The reason for the decrease would be related to the decrease in the
diffusion rate of glucose fuel because of increased viscosity of the
solution. On the other hand, Figure 8c presents the evolution of OCV and IR stack. The OCV
was constant or very slightly increased with the increasing glucose
concentration up to 0.6 mol dm–3, and then it decreased
at higher glucose concentrations. Meanwhile, the IR stack was almost
constant up to 0.6 mol dm–3 and then increased with
the increasing glucose concentration. These results suggest that up
to 0.6 mol dm–3 of glucose, adsorption of the fuel
molecules and desorption of the product from the catalyst surface
efficiently occurred, but above this concentration, the number of
glucose molecules in excess increases progressively within the electric
double layer of the anode, which impedes a rapid catalytic reaction
cycle.

K. [KOH] = 4.0 mol dm–3, flow rate of glucose solution
= 10 cm3 min–1.

Base Concentration in the Fuel Solution
Subsequently,
the effect of base (KOH) concentration on the cell performance was
studied. Here, the role of KOH is threefold: it is used as the supporting
electrolyte, to oxidize the metal surface, and to induce the tautomeric
change of glucose from a ring form to the chain form, which is more
vulnerable to oxidation. Importantly, the evolutions of OCV and IR
stack with the KOH concentration showed an opposite trend to those
with the glucose concentration. As shown in Figure 9a, the power density and the cell voltage
increased with the increasing KOH concentration up to 4.0 mol dm–3 and then leveled off. At 8.0 mol dm–3 KOH, a decrease in the potential at the peak current density was
observed. Also, in the I–V characteristics (Figure 9b), the decrease in the cell voltage was more effectively
suppressed with the increasing KOH concentration up to 4.0 mol dm–3. The OCV increased up to 1.05 V when the KOH concentration
was increased to 4.0 mol dm–3 and then leveled off
at higher concentrations (Figure 9c). By contrast, the IR stack steeply decreased with
the increasing KOH concentration up to 4 mol dm–3 and leveled off thereafter. With the increasing KOH concentration,
the surface of the anode metal catalyst becomes more vulnerable to
the oxidation and dehydrogenative adsorption of glucose molecules
is activated, thus the power density and OCV increased. However, the
increase of OH– ions promotes combination with H+, which accounts for the increase in OCV and decrease in the
resistance in IR stack. The increase in OCV with the increasing KOH
concentration is the opposite trend to the previously reported results
using an anion exchange membrane as the separator.17

at 298 K. [Glucose] = 0.4 mol dm–3, feed rate of
glucose solution = 10 cm3 min–1.

Temperature Dependence
Figure 10 depicts
the temperature dependence on the I–W and I–V characteristics.
The cell power increased when the temperature
was elevated from 298 to 318 K, but the power did not increase further
at higher temperature, rather it slightly decreased at 348 K. This
can be reasonably explained by spontaneous oxidation of glucose molecules
in the strongly basic solution prior to reaching the catalyst surface,
which becomes more remarkable at high temperature. On the other hand,
the drop of cell voltage with the increasing current density was less
remarkable at lower temperatures but not detrimental even at 328 K.

of the DGFC. [Glucose] = 0.4 mol dm–3, [KOH] = 4.0
mol dm–3, flow rate = 10 cm3 min–1.

Effect of the Flow Rate
The effect of the flow rate
of glucose fuel solution on the cell properties was investigated at
298 and 328 K. As shown in Figure 11, the larger current density was observed at 328 K
at a given flow rate, implying the larger reaction rates for both
glucose oxidation. Moreover, at each temperature, the cell voltage
increased with the increasing flow rate up to 50 cm3 min–1, whereas it leveled off at higher flow rates. This
implies a transition from the diffusion-limited current to the reaction-limited
one. At the low flow rate regime (≤50 cm3 min–1), the current is determined by the diffusion of fuel
solution to the catalyst surface, whereas at the high-rate regime
(>50 cm3 min–1), the current is governed
by the reaction rate. The maximum power density and corresponding
cell voltage were 58.2 mW cm–2 (0.36 V) and 95.7
mW cm–2 (0.34 V) at 298 and 328 K, respectively.

and (b,d) 328 K. [Glucose] = 0.4 mol dm–3, [KOH]
= 4.0 mol dm–3.

Stability of the Power
Finally, stability of the power
density of this DGFC was investigated at the optimal condition determined
above. As shown in Figure 12a, under the constant voltage of 0.37 V, the initial power
density at 328 K was 89.7 mW cm–2. After 28 min,
the power density dropped by 8.0% to 82.5 mW cm–2. At 298 K (Figure 12b), the initial power density was 64.2 mW cm–2,
which dropped by 27.4% to 46.6 mW cm–2 after 180
min. A plausible reason for the deactivation is adsorption of reaction
intermediates and byproducts on the catalyst surface.

density at the constant voltage of 0.37
V at (a) 328 K and (b) 298 K. [Glucose] = 0.4 mol dm–3, [KOH] = 4.0 mol dm–3, flow rate = 50 cm3 min–1.

Conclusions
We demonstrated here that a high power
density (maximum 95.7 mW
cm–2) can be generated with DGFC by optimizing the
following seven parameters: composition of the Au–Pt bimetallic
anode catalyst, ionomer/carbon weight ratio, loading amount of the
catalyst on the anode, glucose and KOH concentrations in the fuel
solution, and flow rate and operation temperature. It was found that
among different bimetallic compositions, the Au80Pt20 system shows the highest catalytic activity for the glucose
oxidation. Optimal conditions were found at I/C = 0.2 (in weight ratio),
0.4 mol dm–3 glucose, 4.0 mol dm–3 KOH, and 50 cm3 min–1 flow rate of
fuel solution. Regarding the I/C ratio, too low concentration of the
ionomer is ineffective for making the electric contact between the
metal catalyst and the anode, whereas a too high concentration of
the ionomer covers the catalyst surface and impedes the approach of
the fuel molecules to the catalyst surface. A too high concentration
of glucose remarkably increases the solution viscosity, thereby reducing
the diffusion of the fuel to the catalyst surface. Although the increase
in the base concentration promotes the transformation of glucose molecules
from the ring to chain conformation, too high a base concentration
induces the spontaneous oxidation of glucose in the solution, which
impedes the electrooxidation on the catalyst surface. The cell power
is also affected by the flow rate of the glucose fuel solution. It
increased with an increase in the flow rate up to 50 cm3 min–1 but stagnated at higher flow rates, implying
the transition from the diffusion-determining current to reaction-determining
one. At the condition where all these parameters were optimized, the
maximum power densities and corresponding cell voltage of 58.2 mW
cm–2 (0.36 V) and 95.7 mW cm–2 (0.34 V) were recorded at 298 and 328 K, respectively.

Experimental
Section
Materials
HAuCl4·4H2O, H2PtCl6·6H2O, NaBH4, ethanol,
1-propanol, and β-d-glucose were of reagent grade from
Wako and used without further purification. PVP (Mw = 50 000) and Nafion solution (5 wt % in lower
aliphatic alcohol/water) were provided from Sigma-Aldrich. Ketjen
Black 600 (KB600) was purchased from Lion. Water was deionized with
a Milli-Q system (18.2 mΩ cm in resistivity).

Preparation
of the Anode Catalyst
The anode catalyst
used here was Au–Pt bimetallic nanoparticles prepared by the
chemical reduction of mixed HAuCl4/H2PtCl6 aqueous solutions in presence of a stabilizer (PVP). For
instance, Au80Pt20 nanoparticles were prepared
by mixing 8.0 cm3 of HAuCl4 (2 mmol dm–3), 2.0 cm3 of H2PtCl6 (2 mmol dm–3), 20 cm3 of PVP (10 mmol dm–3 in repeating unit concentration), and 68 cm3 of water
in a 150 cm3 vial and stirred for 15 min. Subsequently,
to this solution, 2 cm3 of NaBH4 (100 mmol dm–3) was quickly added under vigorous stirring to reduce
metal ions. Separately, a calculated amount of carbon powder (KB600)
was placed in a 200 cm3 vial. After adding 50 cm3 of water, it was sonicated for 1 h to obtain homogeneous dispersion.
Then these two dispersions were mixed together and vigorously stirred
for 12 h to attain an adsorption/desorption equilibrium. Finally,
the carbon-supported metal catalysts were filtrated, washed with copious
amount of water, and dried at 60 °C for 24 h in vacuum. The metal
catalysts were observed with TEM (Hitachi H-7650 at 120 kV and JEOL
JEM-2100F at 200 kV). EDS analysis was performed with a JEOL JED-2300T
using Au Lα line (9.441 keV) and Pt Lα line (9.712 keV).
Particle size distributions were determined from about 2000 particles
using ImageJ program.

Cyclic Voltammetry
The electrocatalytic
properties
of Au–Pt bimetallic nanoparticles for glucose oxidation were
evaluated from CV. The samples were prepared as follows. In a plastic
centrifugation tube, 2 mg of the carbon–supported metal catalysts
(5 wt % metal/carbon) was suspended in 2 cm3 of mixed ethanol/water
(1/1; v/v), then it was centrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded.
The precipitate was mixed with 8 mm3 of 5 wt % Nafion in
1-propanol/water (7/3; v/v) and sonicated for 20 min to obtain the
catalyst ink. Then, a 1.5 mm3 aliquot of the ink was placed
on a Teflon-lined glassy carbon disk electrode (Toyo Corporation G0229,
2 mm ϕ). After drying at 393 K for 15 min, it was used as a
working electrode. A Pt wire (Toyo G0228) was used as a counter electrode,
and an Ag|AgCl electrode with saturated KCl (Toyo K0265) was employed
as a reference electrode. These three electrodes were immersed in
10 cm3 of 0.2 mol dm–3 KOH solution in
presence or absence of 0.1 mol dm–3 glucose. The
CV profile was recorded in the range between −0.8 and +0.8
V versus Ag|AgCl (saturated KCl) at the scan rate of 20 mV s–1 on a Hokuto Denko HZ5000 potentio-galvanostat.

Fuel Cell Setup
and Operation
The DGFC used here was
a CHEMIX DFC-010-01 comprising a cation exchange membrane, two electrodes,
two silicon gaskets, two graphite separators, two current collectors
made of Au-plated Cu, and two stainless plates, located from the center
to both ends in this order. The anode was carbon cloth (Fuel Cell
Earth CCP40, 3.2 × 3.2 cm2) on which the catalyst
ink was deposited. Here, the metal concentration in the catalyst ink
was 60 wt % with respect to the carbon support. The cathode used here
was a commercial Pt/C paper (Toray EC-E20-10-07). These two electrodes
were separated from each other with a monovalent CPM (Astom CIMS,
0.15 mm thick). On the graphite separators, a serpentine flow channel
was graved to provide the glucose fuel solution or oxygen gas. Concentrations
of glucose and KOH were 0.4 and 4.0 mol dm–3, respectively,
unless otherwise noticed. The flow rates of glucose fuel solution
and air were 10 cm3 min–1 and 2.0 dm3 min–1, respectively. The current–power
(I–W) and the current–voltage
(I–V) properties of the glucose
fuel cell were conducted with a Toyo PEMTest8900DM system. The cell
properties were measured at 298 K unless otherwise noticed.
