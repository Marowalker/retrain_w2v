One of the prominent methods for carbon dioxide sequestration
is
disposal into deep saline aquifers. This is mainly because deep saline
aquifers provide significant capacity for storage of unwanted fluids
underground for a long period. However, saline aquifers may have a
leaky cap rock. The sealing capacity of a cap rock must, therefore,
be evaluated to ensure the integrity and safety of its storage media;
hence robust classifications of the cap rock are required even before
starting the storage/disposal operations. Aqueous fluids can be injected
into a target storage aquifer, and pressure changes owing to leakage
can be monitored in an upper aquifer separated by a cap rock for a
short period. The measurement of pressure responses in the monitoring
aquifer can be used to identify and characterize any leakage path
in the cap rock. This paper provides analytical models in the Laplace
domain for both in situ and ex situ CO2 sequestration methods.
Using the numerical Laplace inverse method called the “Stehfest”
method, the analytical solution in the real domain is calculated.
The analytical solutions developed can be used for determining both
dimensionless pressure changes in monitoring and storage aquifers
due to leakages and dimensionless leakage rates.

1 Introduction
Underground saline aquifers
are widely used for the disposal and
storage of waste and unwanted fluids. Due to their large capacity,
deep saline aquifers and depleted oil reservoirs are now the main
candidates for geological storage of CO2 as a means to
cut anthropogenic CO2 emissions.1−7 There are two options for carbon dioxide sequestration in a deep
saline aquifer: in situ and ex situ sequestration. In the in situ
approach, carbon dioxide directly is injected to the aquifer; however,
in the ex situ method, carbon dioxide converted to carbonates and
then is injected to the aquifer.8−10 Also, the interaction between
the rock and fluid in situ and ex situ processes is different. Cui
et al.11 investigated the comprehensive
study on building rock and fluid interaction models through sensitivity
analysis on several operational parameters and reservoir characteristics.
Unlike petroleum reservoirs, saline aquifers usually do not have competent
sealing cap rocks. To have safe storage and disposal, classifying
a cap rock competence is essential to detect any leaky pathway.12,13 An operator may then decide to seal the pathway or to inject far
away from the leakage.14−26

There are various natural ways to facilitate the leakage phenomenon
in CO2 sequestration such as fractures in carbonates.27−29 One of the examples comes to mind to highlight the existence of
large fractures in carbonates is the Wabamun Lake Sequestration Project
(WASP). In this project, fractures could be as large as 1 km2.30 Different methods have been developed
to characterize CO2 leakage in a CO2 sequestration
process. Deng et al.31 performed a numerical
simulation on Rock Spring Uplift, Wyoming, to determine the leakage,
injectivity, and storage capacity in different cases. They attempted
to figure out the effect of heterogeneities on these variables. Shakiba
and Hosseini32 employed the fast Fourier
transform (FFT) method to drive a periodic pressure response; their
solution only considered pressure data in the monitoring and pulsing
wells. Another approach is using hydraulic controls, which provide
a method for remediation of CO2 leakage from storage reservoirs.
This method provides a solution in the case where the geographic location
of a leakage point is uncertain. Zahasky and Benson6 evaluated three different leakage intervention strategies,
including CO2 injection shutoff, CO2 production
from a reservoir, and hydraulic controls. They constructed various
models to investigate how residual trapping, a leakage detection time,
fault permeability, and heterogeneity influenced the efficacy of different
interference plans.6

Different methods
can be employed for detecting CO2 leakage
during the sequestration process.33−37 For instance, using the temperature distribution
near the wellbore to detect the near-wellbore leakage in CO2 sequestration.33,38 Viswanathan et al.39 proposed a hybrid model considering different
data from various sources to predict the overall performance of CO2 sequestration. These data sources include experimental data
in the lab, power plant data, and data from the sequestration site
employed in the system-level-based model to predict sequestration
performance. Carroll et al. assessed the effect of water quality on
the CO2 sequestration process and performed sensitivity
analysis on different parameters. Jordan et al.40 developed a reduced-order model for predicting carbon dioxide
leakage in a cemented wellbore through the sequestration process using
a response surface method (RSM). They employed Monte Carlo to perform
sensitivity analysis and figure out the most important parameters
in their model. Pawar et al.41 proposed
an integrated risk assessment approach to figure out the risk profile
of CO2 leakage during the sequestration process and to
provide a more realistic decision-making method, especially for long-term
sequestration processes. Harp et al.42 developed
a reduced-order model for determining leakage rate, near wellbores
using a multivariable adaptive regression approach. Their model can
be employed in a case of leakage in transient flow regime; this type
of flow regime occurs in near-wellbore conditions.

Susanto et
al.43 proposed a monitoring
technique to detect CO2 leakage in geological storage pilots
employing hydrogen gas as a tracer. Jenkins et al.3 proposed a simple atmospheric monitoring technique for
a CCS site. However, they were not able to test recovery of leak volumes
thoroughly, because of uncertainty about an effective release height,
but their technique was true within a factor of two, which is enough
for early alarm-sounding and could be much enhanced in a certain CCS
setting.3

Owing to the fast propagation
of pressure, pressure monitoring
can be employed as an efficient tool for detection and characterization
of leakage from an injection zone to overlying zones.15,17,19,21,22,24−26 Migration through a cap rock causes a pressure change in its upper
aquifers. Analytical models to determine a pressure change due to
leakage through a fault have developed in the literature.32,44−51

There are lots of researches have been done for leakage characterization
in toxic material disposal to the underground water supply, for instance,
the study performed by Javandel et al.52 and Aller.53 Javandel et al.52 proposed a model based on the analytical solution
of the diffusivity equation developed for a horizontal bed configuration;
their model is useful for a case of CO2 leakage from a
horizontal aquifer across an abandoned well. In their proposed model,
through monitoring well the pressure at the storage aquifer could
be monitored. Their developed approach considered single-phase flow
with a constant density. There are various researchers, who made an
effort to improve the solutions provided by Javandel et al.,52 for example, Silliman and Higgins,54 Avci,55 Avci,56 and Nordbotten et al.57

Zeidouni et al.23 developed an
analytical
approach to characterize and detect a leakage path in a CO2 sequestration process. In their model, they considered single-phase
flow through the leakage pathway and aquifers. It should be mentioned
that they examined the injection fluid as an aqueous one. Consequently,
if the injected fluids are nonaqueous, their model cannot be directly
employed. Also, prior to the sequestering process, contamination tests
must be performed.

Zeidouni and Pooladi-Darvish24 introduced
a general idea of a forward approach, where a relationship between
a pressure change in the upper aquifer and leakage parameters was
developed. They parameterized the corresponding inverse problem and
analyzed its solution. They investigated the uniqueness of the solution
via a Hessian matrix and an analytical method. Also, they studied
the stability of the solution based on a correlation matrix and sensitivity
coefficients. They investigated the convergence issue of several deterministic
optimization approaches for leakage parameter prediction and estimated
the required parameters for noise-free data. Also, they investigated
the impact of noises and presented the results regarding a confidence
interval.26 Zeidouni and Pooladi-Darvish25 provided an asymptotic solution to calculate
real-time pressure for leakage detection. Using their advanced approach,
a coefficient of leakage and a term including location parameters
can be approximated explicitly. To evaluate the place of leakage,
they have incorporated the data explicitly extracted by matching the
pressure data.

Zeidouni)37 developed
an analytical
approach considering a bounded, layered reservoir in which all of
the layers connected by a leaky path. He considered single-phase flow
through the leakage pathway and aquifers. He presented the analytical
solution in a Laplace domain regarding a real-time asymptotic solution
and extended his model to multilayer reservoirs. Ahmadi and Chen14 proposed a one-dimensional linear model for
calculating the leakage rate in bounded saline aquifers using pressure
changes in monitoring aquifer.

In this work, the analytical
models appropriate for leakage from
local weakness in a cap rock are developed. The analytical solutions
for pressure changes in both storage and monitoring aquifers along
with a leakage rate are obtained in a Laplace domain. It should be
noted that all of the developed equations are dimensionless and can
be employed in both small and large cases. To evaluate the developed
analytical solutions, two different synthetic cases and sensitivity
analysis are performed on the most relevant parameters. Moreover,
dimensionless parameters are defined to simplify the proposed analytical
solution.

2 Model Description and Governing Equations
The one-dimensional physical model used for in situ CO2 sequestration is the same as those proposed by Ahmadi and Chen,14 Zeidouni et al.24Figure 1a shows the
configuration of the wells as well as variables used for in situ CO2 sequestration process. In a case of in situ CO2 sequestration, there are two aquifers; the lower is considered as
storage and the upper one is used as a monitoring aquifer. Also, there
is a thin layer between those aquifers that the leakage happens from
the leaky path on it.14,23−25 There are different
assumptions made in this paper such as leakage direction is only vertical,
there is no gravity effect, both injected fluid and brines in the
aquifers have the same properties, both monitoring and storage aquifers
are homogenous and isotropic, and the threshold pressure of the cap
rock is ignored. In Figure 1, the distance between the leak location and injection well
denoted by XA, Xe stands for the spacing between the injection and monitoring
wells, rate of injection and monitoring are qin and qm, respectively. Permeability,
height, and area of the formation denoted by K, h, and A, correspondingly. Subscript “A”
stands for the storage aquifer, “l” represents the leakage
path, and “m” denotes the monitoring aquifer. In the
case of in situ CO2 sequestration, the injection rate is
equal to q. The ratio of production to the injection
rate is equal to a in the ex situ CO2 sequestration
process.14,23−25Figure 1b depicts the configuration of the wells
(injection and production wells) in the case of ex situ CO2 sequestration process.

3 Analytical Solution
3.1 Pressure Response of the Monitoring Aquifer
To determine the response of the pressure in the monitoring aquifer
in a case of in situ CO2 sequestration, the diffusivity
equation is solved for pressure in this aquifer in response to the
unknown leakage rate as follows14 1  ηm stands for the diffusivity
coefficient of the monitoring aquifer. The initial and boundary conditions
can be expressed using the following equations 2   3   4  where Pmi is the
initial pressure of the monitoring aquifer, qi(t) denotes the leakage rate, B represents the formation volume factor, and Km and Am defined, as in Figure 1. Using the dimensionless
variables reported in Table 1, the dimensionless form of the diffusivity equation is derived
as follows 5   6   7   8  Solving eq 5 with the above-mentioned initial and boundary conditions
results in the following equation for calculating the dimensionless
pressure response of the monitoring aquifer due to the leakage process. 9  The two important dimensionless groups that
appear in the solution are ηD and TD. While ηD signifies the ratio of diffusivities
in the monitoring to the storage aquifers, TD is the ratio of transmissivity (permeability × area)
in the monitoring to the storage aquifers. Hereafter, the term “transmissivity
ratio” will refer to TD and the
“diffusivity ratio” will denote ηD.

3.2 Pressure Response of the Storage Aquifer
To specify a pressure response throughout the storage aquifer,
we have to determine a change of aquifer pressure owing to injection
and the other pressure changes due to the leak. Then, via the method
of superposition, we are able to calculate the pressure change in
the storage aquifer. The following sections present the details of
pressure change calculations.

3.2.1 Effect of Injection
To assess the
influence of the injection well, we write the equations such that
the storage aquifer is centered at the injection well (defined as X = 0 at the injection well) assuming no leakage. The unknown
of the problem is only the pressure. The diffusivity equation under
this condition is as follows14 10  The initial and boundary conditions in the
storage aquifer due to the injection are expressed in the below equations 11   12   13  where Psi is the
initial pressure of the storage aquifer, qin denotes the injection rate, B represents the formation
volume factor, and Ks and As defined as in Figure 1. Using the dimensionless variables reported in Table 1, the dimensionless
form of the diffusivity equation is derived as follows14 14   15   16   17  Using the dimensionless variables and the
dimensionless boundary and initial conditions results in the following
equation for calculating the dimensionless pressure change in the
storage aquifer due to the injection 18  It should be noted that if one is interested
in calculating the effect of the injection on the storage aquifer
pressure response at the leakage location, eq 18 is evaluated at XD = XAD. Using the inverse Laplace of eq 18 leads the below equation
in the real domain that represents the dimensionless form of the storage
aquifer pressure response owing to the injection 19   20  

3.2.2 Effect of Leakage
In this case,
the diffusivity equation is written with the center at the leakage
path in the absence of any injection as follows14 21  The initial and boundary conditions in the
storage aquifer due to the leakage are expressed in the following
equations 22   23   24  Using the dimensionless variables reported
in Table 1, the dimensionless
form of the diffusivity equation for the response of the storage aquifer
pressure owing to the leakage is derived as follows 25   26   27   28  Using the above-mentioned dimensionless boundary
and initial conditions, eEq 25 is solved and the dimensionless pressure response of the
storage aquifer owing to the leakage can be calculated as follows 29  To evaluate the storage aquifer pressure response
owing to leakage at the leakage location, one needs to evaluate eEq 29 when XD = XAD.

3.2.3 Effect of Production
To assess
the influence of the production well, we define a well location X = Xe as the production well
location, assuming no leakage. Also, we consider that the production
rate is constant, and it can be written as a ratio to the injection
rate. So, in ex situ condition, we have. The unknown of the problem is only the
pressure. The diffusivity equation under this condition is as follows 30  The initial and boundary conditions in the
storage aquifer due to the production are expressed in the following
equations 31   32   33  where, qprod denotes
the production rate, and all of the parameters are the same as previous
ones. Using the dimensionless variables reported in Table 1, the dimensionless form of
the diffusivity equation is derived as follows 34   35   36   37  Using the dimensionless variables and the
dimensionless boundary and initial conditions results in the below
equation for evaluating the dimensionless storage aquifer pressure
response owing to the production 38  

3.3 Superposition Approach
3.3.1 In Situ CO2 Sequestration Case
In this section, the solution derived for a case of in situ CO2 sequestration is presented in the following.

3.3.1.1 Pressure Response at the Monitoring Well
As mentioned before, to examine the dimensionless pressure response
at the monitoring well, we have to calculate eq 9 when XD = 1 39  To calculate the dimensionless leakage rate,
one needs to have both dimensionless pressures in the storage and
monitoring aquifers at the leakage location (XAD). Using Eeq 9 and the combination of Eeqs 18 and 29 at the leakage location (XAD) (the storage aquifer pressure response at
the leakage location due to the injection and leakage) results in
the dimensionless leakage rate as follows 40  where 41  Rearrangement of Eeq 40 yields the following equation 42  To calculate the leakage rate at the leakage
location, we have to determine the inverse Laplace of Eeq 42 as follows 43  However, determining an analytical inverse
Laplace of the above equation is impossible; we used the Stehfest
approach to find the solution behavior in a real-time domain. 44  Rearrangement of Eeq 44 yields the following equation 45  To calculate the monitoring aquifer pressure
response at the location of the monitoring well, we have to determine
the inverse Laplace of Eeq 45 as follows 46  

3.3.1.2 Pressure Response in the Storage Aquifer
As mentioned before, the pressure response at the leakage path
in the storage aquifer can be determined using the superposition of
the pressure changes in the storage aquifer owing to the leakage and
injection. Using the superposition approach yields the following equation
for determining the storage aquifer pressure response 47  Rearranging Eeq 47 yields the following equation 48  Recalling Eeq 42 and substituting it into Eeq 48 result in the following equation 49  Equation 49 is employed for evaluating the storage aquifer pressure
response; however, the inverse Laplace of the equation above cannot
be determined. Consequently, to calculate the pressure change using Eeq 49, we have to use the
numerical Laplace inversion methods, i.e., the Stehfest method.

3.3.2 Ex Situ CO2 Sequestration
The only difference between the in situ and ex situ CO2 sequestration studied in this paper is using the production well
that completed in the storage aquifer. The following section provides
the solution for the pressure response owing to the production from
the storage aquifer. It is worth to mention that all of the other
sections are the same for both in situ and ex situ carbon dioxide
sequestration.

3.3.2.1 Pressure Change at the Production Well
As mentioned before, to evaluate the dimensionless pressure response
at the production well, we have to calculate Eeq 9 when XD = 1 50  To calculate the dimensionless leakage rate,
one needs to have both dimensionless pressures in the storage and
monitoring aquifers at the leakage location (XAD). Based on the Darcy equation, we have14,23,24 51  From the dimensionless pressure definition,
we have 52   53  Substitution of Eeqs 52 and 53 into Eeq 51 results in 54  where 55  We assumed that the second term of Eeq 54 will be zero because
of a long period of leakage process and we have 56  Replacing PDS and PDm when XD = XAD leads the equation below 57  where 58  Rearranging eq 57 results
in the following equation 59  To calculate the leakage rate at the leakage
location, we have to determine the inverse Laplace of Eeq 59 as follows 60  However, determining an analytical inverse
Laplace of the above equation is impossible; same as previous sections,
we used the Stehfest approach for evaluating the solutions in a real-time
domain. 61  To determine the monitoring aquifer pressure
response at the monitoring well location, we have to determine the
inverse Laplace of Eeq 61 as follows 62  

3.3.2.2 Pressure Response in the Storage Aquifer
As mentioned before, the pressure change at the leakage path in
the storage aquifer can be calculated using the superposition of the
pressure changes in the storage aquifer owing to the leakage, production,
and injection. Using the superposition approach yields the following
equation for evaluating the storage aquifer pressure response 63  Rearranging Eeq 63 results in the equation below 64  Equation 64 is employed for calculating the pressure change in
the storage aquifer; however, the inverse Laplace of the equation
above cannot be determined. Consequently, to calculate the pressure
change using Eeq 64,
we have to use the numerical Laplace inversion methods, i.e., the
Stehfest method.

4 Results and Discussion
4.1 In Situ CO2 Sequestration Problem
To examine the pressure responses of both the storage and monitoring
aquifers along with the leakage rate, a numerical Laplace inverse
method called the Stehfest method is employed. Two different cases
are considered to determine the effects of the most important parameters
on the pressure changes in both the storage and monitoring aquifers
accompanied by the leakage rate. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis
of the leakage path location and dimensionless diffusivity is performed
in both cases. The following sections present the details in each
case.

4.2 Synthetic Case 1
The analytical solutions
are applied to this synthetic case in which the dimensionless storage
aquifer pressure response at the monitoring well and the dimensionless
leakage rate are calculated. In this case, we consider the injection
rate of 0.02 m3/s. The thickness of the storage aquifer,
monitoring aquifer, and the impermeable layer is equal to 30, 45,
and 16 m, respectively. The permeability of the monitoring aquifer
is equal to 2 × 10–13 m2, and the
permeability of the storage aquifer and the leaky path is 5 ×
10–13 and 2.5 × 10–15 m2, respectively. All of the parameters for the synthetic case
1 are reported in Table 2.

Figure 2 demonstrates
the behavior of the dimensionless leakage rate using eq 43. As depicted in this figure, changing
the dimensionless diffusivity coefficient (ηD) affects
the dimensionless leakage rate considerably. In this case, the important
factor is the ratio of Km/Ks because the order of magnitude for porosity values is
the same. Hence, an increase or decrease in the dimensionless diffusivity
corresponds to the role of each permeability value, which contributes
directly or inversely to the leakage. Increasing the permeability
value of the storage aquifer reduces the dimensionless diffusivity
coefficient (ηD). As shown in Figure 2, the lower the values of the dimensionless
diffusivity coefficient (ηD), the higher the dimensionless
leakage rate. The story is the same as monitoring aquifer, the higher
the permeability of monitoring aquifer, the higher the value of dimensionless
diffusivity coefficient (ηD). The higher the values
of dimensionless diffusivity coefficient (ηD), the
lower the value of dimensionless leakage rate. It should be noted
that in this case, we consider that the location of the leakage has
the same distance from both the injection and monitoring wells.

dimensionless time (tD) in a case of in
situ CO2 sequestration considering different dimensionless
diffusivity coefficients (ηD) [0.01:0.01:0.1] when XAD = 0.5.

Figure 3 depicts
the behavior of the dimensionless leakage rate against the corresponding
dimensionless time (tD) considering the
different dimensionless leakage location (XAD) when the dimensionless diffusivity coefficient is equal to 0.533.
As illustrated in this figure, increasing the XAD results in delaying the leakage. This is mainly because
the time required for the pressure front to reach the leaky path depends
on the leakage location. Consequently, increasing the distance between
the leaky path and the injection well results in the pressure front
to take more time to reach the leakage well.

dimensionless time (tD) in a case of in

distance between leakage path and injection well (XAD) [0.1:0.1:0.9] when ηD = 0.533.

Figure 4 demonstrates
the behavior of the PDs at the monitoring
well in the storage aquifer vs the dimensionless time (tD) considering different ηD when XAD is equal to 0.5. As shown in this figure,
increasing the ηD does not have an impact on the
dimensionless pressure in the storage aquifer at the earlier time.
However, at the late time, the effect of the ηD on
the PDs is recognizable. Increasing the
ηD decreases the PDs at
the late time.

location of monitoring well in the storage aquifer vs dimensionless
time (tD) in a case of in situ CO2 sequestration considering different dimensionless diffusivity

Figure 5 shows the
behavior of the PDs at the monitoring
well in the storage aquifer vs the dimensionless time (tD) considering a different XAD when the ηD is equal to 0.533. As illustrated in
this figure, increasing the XAD results
in no considerable change in the PDs at
the location of the monitoring well in the storage aquifer.

Figure 6 demonstrates
the behavior of PDs at the monitoring
well against the dimensionless time (tD) considering different ηD when XAD is equal to 0.5. As mentioned before, the ηD is defined as the ratio of the diffusivity coefficient in
the monitoring aquifer over the diffusivity coefficient in the storage
aquifer. This means that increasing the diffusivity coefficient in
the monitoring aquifer increases the ηD. As a result,
as clearly seen from Figure 6, increasing the ηD increases the PDm.

monitoring well vs dimensionless time (tD) in a case of in situ CO2 sequestration considering different
dimensionless diffusivity coefficients (ηD) [0.01:0.01:0.1]

Figure 7 illustrates
the analytical solutions of the PDm at
the monitoring well against the dimensionless time (tD) considering various XAD when ηD is equal to 0.533. As demonstrated in this
figure, at the late time, increasing the XAD increases slightly the PDm.

monitoring well vs dimensionless time (tD) in a case of in situ CO2 sequestration considering the
different dimensionless distance between the leakage path and injection

4.3 Synthetic Case 2
In this case, the
only changed parameter is the permeability of the monitoring aquifer,
which is equal to 2 × 10–12 m2.
As clearly seen, the ηD, in this case, is 10 times
that in the previous case. This is because we will determine the effect
of the parameters in both cases on the matter whether the ηD is large or small. All of the parameters for the synthetic
case 2 are reported in Table 3.

Figure 8 demonstrates
the behavior of the dimensionless leakage rate in the synthetic case
2 using eq 34. As depicted
in this figure, changing the ηD from 0.000533 to
5.333 affects the dimensionless leakage rate considerably. Increasing
ηD decreases the dimensionless leakage rate. In this
case, there is a competitive effect between the permeability of the
monitoring aquifer and storage aquifer because all of the other parameters
are kept constant, and values for the porosity have the same order
of magnitude. As a result, the permeability of monitoring and storage
aquifers inversely affected the dimensionless leakage rate. The higher
the permeability of the monitoring and storage aquifers, the lower
the dimensionless leakage rate.

Figure 9 shows the
behavior of the dimensionless leakage rate vs the corresponding dimensionless
time (tD) considering a different XAD when the dimensionless diffusivity coefficient
is equal to 5.33. As illustrated in this figure, increasing the XAD results in delaying the leakage. Moreover,
the comparison between the results presented in Figures 3 and 9 reveals that
the delay period when ηD = 5.33 is greater than the
case in which ηD = 0.533.

Figure 10 demonstrates
the behavior of the PDs at the monitoring
well in the storage aquifer vs the dimensionless time (tD) considering different ηD when XAD is equal to 0.5. As shown in this figure,
increasing the ηD affects the dimensionless pressure
noticeably in the storage aquifer at the late time.

in no considerable change in the PDs at
the location of the monitoring well in the storage aquifer.

between the leakage path and injection well (XAD) [0.1:0.1:0.9] when ηD = 5.33.

Figure 12 illustrates
the behavior of the PDm at the monitoring
well vs the dimensionless time (tD) considering
various ηD when XAD is
equal to 0.5. As clearly seen from this figure, increasing the ηD from 0.000533 to 5.333 increases the PDm at the monitoring well considerably at the late time.

0.5.

Figure 13 depicts
the analytical solutions of the PDm at
the monitoring well against the dimensionless time (tD) considering a different XAD when ηD is equal to 5.33. As demonstrated in this
figure, at the late time, increasing the XAD results in a very small change in the PDm at the monitoring well.

4.4 Ex Situ CO2 Sequestration Problem
In the case of ex situ carbon dioxide sequestration, we consider
the constant ratio between the production rate and injection rate a = 0.2. All of the parameters are the same as the synthetic
case 1 for in situ CO2 sequestration. Figure 14 demonstrates the behavior
of the dimensionless leakage rate in the case of ex situ CO2 sequestration using eq 63. As depicted in this figure, changing the ηD affects the dimensionless leakage rate considerably. Increasing
ηD decreases the dimensionless leakage rate. It should
be noted that in this case, we consider that the location of the leakage
has the same distance from both the injection and production wells.

leakage rate (QD) vs
dimensionless time (tD) for in situ CO2 sequestration considering different dimensionless diffusivity
coefficients (ηD) [0.000533 0.00533 0.0533 0.5333
5.333 53.333] when XAD = 0.5.

Figure 15 shows
the trend of the dimensionless leakage rate change against dimensionless
time at the different XAD in a case of
ex situ CO2 sequestration. As shown in this figure, changing
the leakage path location (XAD) affects
the dimensionless leakage rate noticeably. Increasing XAD results in delaying the leakage; the ultimate leakage
rates in all leakage locations are the same. It reveals that the ultimate
leakage rate is independent of the leakage location.

dimensionless time (tD) in a case of ex
situ CO2 sequestration considering different dimensionless
distance between the leakage path and injection well (XAD) [0.1:0.1:0.5] when ηD = 0.533.

Figure 16 demonstrates
the trend of the dimensionless leakage rate in a case of ex situ CO2 sequestration against dimensionless time at different leakage
path permeabilities. As depicted in this figure, changing the leakage
path permeability (kl) affects the dimensionless
leakage rate noticeably. Increasing the leakage path permeability
(kl) increases the dimensionless leakage
rate.

dimensionless time (tD) in a case of ex
situ CO2 sequestration considering different leakage path
permeabilities [2.5 × 10–19 2.5 × 10–18 2.5 × 10–17 2.5 × 10–16] when ηD = 0.533.

Figure 17 demonstrates
the behavior of the dimensionless leakage rate in a case of ex situ
CO2 sequestration against dimensionless time at different
thicknesses of monitoring aquifer. As depicted in this figure, changing
the monitoring aquifer thickness (hm)
affects the dimensionless leakage rate noticeably. Increasing the
monitoring aquifer thickness (hm) increases
the dimensionless leakage rate.

dimensionless time (tD) in a case of ex
situ CO2 sequestration considering different monitoring

Figure 18 depicts
the behavior of the PDm at the production
well vs the dimensionless time (tD) in
a case of ex situ CO2 sequestration considering different ηD when XAD is equal to 0.5. As clearly seen from this figure, increasing the
ηD from 0.000533 to 5.333 increases the PDm at the production well considerably at the late time.

0.5.

Figure 19 depicts
the behavior of the PDm at the production
well vs the dimensionless time (tD) in
a case of ex situ CO2 sequestration considering different XAD when ηD is equal to 0.533.
As clearly seen from this figure, increasing the XAD from 0.1 to 0.5 increases the PDm at the production well considerably at the late time.

Figure 20 depicts
the behavior of the PDm at the production
well vs the dimensionless time (tD) in
a case of ex situ CO2 sequestration considering different
monitoring aquifer thickness (hm) when XAD is equal to 0.5. As clearly seen from this
figure, increasing the monitoring aquifer thickness (hm) from 1 to 100 does not have any effect on the PDm at the production well. This means that the PDm at the production well is independent of
the thickness of the monitoring aquifer.

production well vs dimensionless time (tD) in a case of ex situ CO2 sequestration considering different

Figure 21 demonstrates
the behavior of the PDs at the location
of the production well in the storage aquifer vs the dimensionless
time (tD) in a case of ex situ CO2 sequestration considering different storage aquifer thickness
(hs) when ηD is equal
to 0.533. As illustrated in this figure, increasing the storage aquifer
thickness (hs) increases the dimensionless
pressure in the storage aquifer. It reveals that the dimensionless
pressure of the storage aquifer at the location of production well
clearly depends on storage aquifer thickness (hs).

Figure 22 demonstrates
the behavior of the PDs at the location
of the production well in the storage aquifer vs the dimensionless
time (tD) in a case of ex situ CO2 sequestration considering the XAD when ηD is equal to 0.533. As depicted in this
figure, increasing the XAD does not have
an impact on the PDs. It reveals that PDs at the production well is independent of
leakage location.

location of a production well in the storage aquifer vs dimensionless
time (tD) in a case of ex situ CO2 sequestration considering the dimensionless distance between

Figure 23 demonstrates
the behavior of the PDs at the location
of the production well in the storage aquifer vs the dimensionless
time (tD) in a case of ex situ CO2 sequestration considering different ηD when XAD is equal to 0.5. As shown in this figure,
increasing the ηD does not have a clear consequence
on the PDs at the earlier time. However,
at the late time, the effect of the ηD on the dimensionless
pressure of the storage aquifer is significant. Increasing the ηD increases the PDs at the late
time.

location of production well in the storage aquifer versus dimensionless
time (tD) in a case of ex situ CO2 sequestration considering dimensionless diffusivity coefficients

when XAD = 0.5.

Those semianalytical models presented above can
give practical
and helpful information for both in situ and ex situ CO2 capture schemes in saline aquifers. Those models are capable of
calculating the CO2 leakage rate due to induced microfractures
or leaky paths. It is worth to stress that the outputs of such analytical
and/or semianalytical just useable as a screening tool to determine
the possible CO2 leakage rate in such aquifers.

5 Conclusions
Analytical models are developed
to determine a dimensionless leakage
rate and a dimensionless pressure response owing to leakage from the
storage aquifer toward the monitoring aquifer for both in situ and
ex situ CO2 sequestration processes. These models are obtained
by solving the dimensionless form of the flow equations in the storage
and monitoring aquifers, which are joined by a dimensionless flow
rate at the leakage path. The principle of superposition is employed
to calculate the storage aquifer pressure response at the leakage
location. The exact analytical solutions are obtained in a Laplace
domain, and the Stehfest method is employed to evaluate the analytical
solutions in the real-time domain numerically. Two different cases
in in situ process and one ex situ example have been considered to
evaluate the behavior of the analytical solutions for both the leakage
rate and the pressure response in the storage and monitoring aquifers.
