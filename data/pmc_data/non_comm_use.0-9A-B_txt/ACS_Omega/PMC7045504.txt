Accumulation of different protein–surfactant
mixtures affords
further knowledge about the structure–property interactions
of biomacromolecules. They will help design suitable surfactants,
which, in turn, can enhance the utilization of protein–surfactant
complexes in biotechnologies, cosmetics, and food industry realms.
Owing to their adaptable and remarkably notable properties, we are
describing herein the interaction of Cm-E2O-Cm gemini surfactants (m = 12, 14, and 16) with α-CHT by employing various spectroscopic
techniques including with molecular docking and density functional
theory (DFT) method. Results have revealed complex formation, unfolding,
and a static quenching mechanism in the interaction of gemini surfactants
with α-CHT. The Stern–Volmer constant (KSV), quenching constant (kq), the number of binding sites (n), and binding
constant (Kb) were interrogated by utilizing
the fluorescence quenching method, UV–vis, synchronous, 3-D,
and resonance Rayleigh scattering fluorescence studies. The data perceive
the α-CHT–Cm-E2O-Cm complex formation along with conformational
alterations induced in α-CHT. The contribution of aromatic residues
to a nonpolar environment is illustrated by pyrene fluorescence. Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy and circular dichroism outcomes reveal
conformational modifications in the secondary structure of α-CHT
with the permutation of gemini surfactants. The computational calculations
(molecular docking and DFT) further corroborate the complex formation
between α-CHT and Cm-E2O-Cm gemini surfactants and the contribution of
electrostatic/hydrophobic interaction forces therein.

1 Introduction
Much
interest has been paid in the last few decades to the protein
complexation with different small molecules that alter the structure
and function of biological macromolecules.1−3 Such interactions
can be utilized to develop synthetic chaperones for protein refolding
and biomedicine as well as in a number of areas including analytical
molecular biology, food, pharmacological, and cosmetic industries,
drug delivery, design of nanocapsules, development of catalysts, etc.2−6 Furthermore, scientists are utilizing protein–surfactant
complexes to design fluorescence sensors.7,8 In
aqueous medium, ambiphilic molecules self-assemble into micelles or
microstructures, which provide hydrophobic centers for encapsulating
fluorophores noncovalently.9 Therefore,
protein–surfactant interactions can stimulate modifications
in the fluorescence emission properties of the encapsulated guest
fluorophores. Hence, the mechanistic scenario of the interaction between
proteins and surfactants is still viewed as a challenging and interactable
study area. Consequently, this inspiration offers ample space for
further exploration of these molecular interactions and to unveil
the relationship between the concerned specific and nonspecific forces.

The serine proteinases are commonly distributed in nature, where
they conduct a wide range of various utilities.10,11 Several proteinases emerge as realms in abundant multifunctional
proteins, but others are independent small peptide chains. Bacterial
serine proteinases share the α-chymotrypsin (α-CHT)-like
bilobal β-barrel structure; however, owing to their shorter
sequences and structural variances in surface loops, they are mostly
distantly linked. The α-CHT belongs to the S1 family, which
is one of the most prevalent serine protease families. It is an essential
component of mammalian digestive systems, where it eventually breaks
large protein molecules into smaller molecules that can be digested
by suitable enzymes for further digestion by other proteolytic enzymes.
The α-CHT preferably cleaves peptide bonds that involve the
carboxyl groups of the aromatic amino acid residues, that is, tyrosine
(Tyr), phenylalanine (Phe), and tryptophan (Trp). Scheme 1d demonstrates that the three-polypeptide
chains (A, B, and C) of the α-CHT are joined by five inter-
and intradisulfide bonds. The α-CHT consists of 245 amino acids
and also contains a catalytic triad (His57, Asp102, and Ser195), which
is part of the second domain and is a reactive group. The α-CHT
also catalyzes the hydrolysis of amides and esters of aromatic amino
acids, although much slower than peptide bonds. Also, the proteolytic
enzyme α-CHT has a prospect to get utilized in biological and
industrial areas.12

Scheme 1 Chemical Structures
of Cationic Cm-E2O-Cm Gemini Surfactants (m = (a)
12, (b) 14, and (c) 16) and (d) Crystallographic Structure of α-Chymotrypsin
These days, the gemini surfactants are drawing
attention as next-generation
surfactants. Having two polar headgroups covalently associated by
a spacer group and two hydrophobic chains, the geminis have numerous
characteristic aggregation properties better than the traditional
single-chain surfactants, which involve deficient critical micelle
concentration (CMC), considerable dependency on the spacer structure,
unusual aggregate morphology, strong hydrophobic microdomains, etc.13 As regard to the interactions of cationic gemini
surfactants with proteins, they also are more proficient with proteins,
in contrast with traditional single-chain surfactants.14−17 Moreover, the consistently expanding ecological concerns of both
consumers and legislation have impelled scientists’ interest
in developing more eco-friendly surfactants. The majority of overall
gemini surfactants have been reported to be toxic to marine life;
therefore, their cytotoxicity is another crucial factor to be proposed.
The surfactants have also been considered to persist in the soil after
they are utilized and cause challenges due to their low rate of degradation,
which, in turn, results in higher cleaning costs and other noteworthy
expenditures.18−20

Because of all these necessities, our research
team has synthesized
a new series of ester-functionalized cationic gemini surfactants,21 assigned as Cm-E2O-Cm (where m = 12, 14, and 16
represent the number of carbon atoms in the hydrophobic chains of
geminis and E2O is the betaine ester-type spacer). The designated
geminis are novel because they satisfy most of the previously mentioned
necessities in a molecule21,22 and have exceptionally
excellent physicochemical characteristics, in contrast with the predominant
gemini surfactants. Due to the presence of cleavable spacer in their
effectively designed structure, the concerned surfactants provide
a progressively broader scope for exposing their unpopulated projects
in fields such as the environment, biochemistry, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals,
etc. Therefore, unveiling and assessing the use of Cm-E2O-Cm geminis as prospective
options to the conventional surfactants in various fields are of great
concern.

To mitigate such concerns, surfactants that are readily
cleavable
suit the perfect option. Consequently, herein assigned surfactants
could be an adequate alternative (in the future). Moreover, there
is no report on the α-CHT–Cm-E2O-Cm interactions to date in the literature.
Different biophysical methodologies, namely, fluorescence spectroscopy
(intrinsic, extrinsic, three-dimensional, synchronous, and resonance
Rayleigh scattering fluorescence), circular dichroism spectroscopy,
UV–vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FT-IR), molecular docking, and DFT, were utilized to explore the
interactions between α-CHT and Cm-E2O-Cm gemini surfactants. This investigation
will assist in scheming and accumulation of protein–surfactant
complexes for their utilization in pharmaceutical and industrial areas.
It will, moreover, address and enhance the impact of gemini structure
on the reliability of proteins.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Identifications on the
Conformational Changes
of α-CHT
To determine the conformational alterations
of α-CHT after dealing with geminis, we have used UV–vis
absorption, synchronous fluorescence, FT-IR, three-dimensional fluorescence
spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and resonance
Rayleigh scattering (RRS) fluorescence to clarify the interaction
between α-CHT and gemini surfactants.

2.1.1 UV–Vis
Absorption Studies
UV–vis absorption analysis is a
remarkably valuable spectroscopic
technique to examine the structural change of a protein and to get
confirmation about the formation of protein–ligand complexes.
The aromatic residues of protein (Trp, Tyr, and Phe residues) provide
absorption peaks in the UV range inferable from their phenyl rings.
A change in their signal affected by the added concentration of ligands
gives corroboration about the formation of a ground-state complex
between the protein and the ligand.

Figure 1 demonstrates that the absorbance of the
α-CHT is impaired with increase in concentration of the cationics.
The spectral band from 260 to 300 nm shows the alteration in the microenvironment
of the chromophore.23 These results lend
support to the static quenching mechanism based on the alterations
observed in the absorption of fluorophore because the complex formation
can only perturb its absorption spectrum with the quencher in the
ground state (static quenching) rather than in the excited state (dynamic
quenching).24

Figure 1 UV–vis absorption
spectra of α-CHT in the presence
of Cm-E2O-Cm (m = (a) 12, (b) 14, and (c) 16) gemini surfactants
(pH 7.8) at 298 K.

2.1.2 Synchronous
Fluorescence Studies
This method incorporates synchronized
scanning of monochromators
for excitation and emission while keeping up a constant wavelength
interval between them. The spectra can provide relevant data about
the molecular environment in proximity of the chromophore groups and
have considerable advantages, for example, spectral interpretation,
sensitivity, spectral bandwidth diminishing, and alleviation of various
perturbing effects.25 When the Δλ
value between emission and excitation wavelengths is stabilized at
20/60 nm, the synchronous fluorescence delivers the consonant data
of Tyr and Trp residues, respectively.26,27 The maximum
excitation wavelength of the residues is directly related to the polarity
of the microenvironment; thus, the conformation of the protein can
be evaluated from the alteration of the maximum excitation wavelength.

Figure 2 demonstrates
the influence of the gemini surfactants, particularly on Tyr and Trp,
on the α-CHT synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy. Comparing Figure 2a–c with Figure 2d–f, the Trp
residue has the stronger fluorescence quenching than Tyr residue,
implying that the aforementioned residue has a significant influence
to the quenching of the α-CHT intrinsic fluorescence.28 We could also ruminate that gemini surfactants
are bonded closer to Trp residues than to Tyr residues. This anomaly
confirms that, during the interaction with Cm-E2O-Cm gemini surfactants, the conformation
of the α-CHT has changed. The outcomes are compatible with the
assertion provided by the absorption spectra.

spectra of α-CHT (2 μM) with
different concentrations of Cm-E2O-Cm (m = 12, 14, and 16) at (a–c)
Δλ = 20 nm for Tyr and (d–f) Δλ = 60
nm for Trp at 298 K (pH 7.8).

2.1.3 Extrinsic Fluorescence Analysis
Pyrene
is a fascinating hydrophobic molecule for examining the microenvironmental
variations around the fluorophores.29 We
see that the micropolarity profiles delineate the dependency of the F1/F3 value on the
concentration of the Cm-E2O-Cm in the nobleness of the α-CHT (as shown in Figure 3).

Figure 3 Variation of micropolarity
around pyrene as a function of Cm-E2O-Cm (m = (a) 12, (b) 14, and (c)
16) gemini surfactants at 298
K (pH 7.8).

These profiles have a comparable
character for all the three systems.
The F1/F3 ratio
for pure water is around 1.8,30 but in
this case, the ratio of α-CHT is found to be 1.76 in the absence
of Cm-E2O-Cm. These results demonstrate that pyrene is localized into the hydrophobic
domains of α-CHT. The first increment of gemini surfactant concentration
into the α-CHT solution produces considerable alterations in
the micropolarity indexes of all α-CHT–Cm-E2O-Cm systems. This
diminishing in micropolarity ratio (F1/F3) values is brought about by the extended
hydrophobic condition around the pyrene (probe) bestowed by the raised
surfactant concentration. This behavior has seen up to a specific
segment of the concentration of the gemini surfactant. At higher concentrations
of geminis, the micropolarity of α-CHT–Cm-E2O-Cm systems remains
unaltered, as depicted by constant F1/F3 values. This region of constancy demonstrates
that molecules of the probe (pyrene) are wholly trapped inside the
different micellar aggregate assemblies. From the thorough exploration
of F1/F3 values,
it is observed that these values emulate the pattern C16-E2O-C16 > C14-E2O-C14 > C12-E2O-C12 at the higher concentration of Cm-E2O-Cm. These outcomes
reveal to have the most grounded impact on the pyrene-sensitive microenvironment
compared to other lower homologues resulting from the prominent character
of hydrophobic interaction forces elaborated in the concerned molecular
interactions.

2.1.4 FT-IR Measurements
The FT-IR spectroscopic
consequences have further revealed the complex formation between the
α-CHT and gemini surfactants. FT-IR spectroscopy gives knowledge
about alterations in conformation of proteins. The FT-IR spectrum
of a protein indicates numerous bands for amide groups, which describe
various vibrations of the peptide moiety. Among all amide modes of
the peptide bonds, amide I is irrefutably the most generally utilized
mode. The peaks for amide I and II take place in the 1600–1700
cm–1 region (mainly C=O stretch) and 1500–1600
cm–1 region (C–N stretch coupled with N–H
bending mode) independently.

The amide I band is highly sensitive
than the amide II band to the alteration in the secondary conformation
of the macromolecules.31,32 The FT-IR spectra are demonstrated
in Figure 4 of free
α-CHT and α-CHT–Cm-E2O-Cm complexes. The peak correlating to the amide
I band has been ascertained to illustrate a shift from 1634 to 1638
cm–1 for free α-CHT to α-CHT-bound Cm-E2O-Cm gemini surfactants.
It suggests that geminis interact with the C=O and C=N
groups in the α-CHT polypeptides, contributing to the rearrangement
in the carbonyl H-bonding network of the polypeptide.33,34 The dramatic reduction in the intensity of amide I band and changes
in peak positions in the presence of gemini surfactants reveal that
the difference in the secondary structure of the α-CHT is due
to α-CHT–Cm-E2O-Cm complex formation.

(2 μM) in the absence and presence
of 0.0867 mM Cm-E2O-Cm (m = 12, 14, and 16) gemini surfactants
at 298 K (pH 7.8).

2.1.5 Three-Dimensional
(3-D) Fluorescence Spectroscopy
In recent decades, the application
of the three-dimensional fluorescence
method has become prevalent so that the contour map in the three-dimensional
spectrum affords much more scientific and systematic relevant data
concerning the conformational and structural modifications of proteins.35 The conformational and microenvironmental alterations
of the α-CHT have been evaluated in the absence and presence
of the cationic geminis by attributing their spectral characteristics. Figure 5a–d illustrates
the three-dimensional emission spectra and the equivalent contour
maps (providing a bird’s eye view of the fluorescence spectra)
of α-CHT in the absence and presence of the concerned surfactants.

Figure 5 Three-dimensional
(3-D) fluorescence spectra of (a) α-CHT
(2 μM) in the absence and presence of 2.459 μM Cm-E2O-Cm (m = (b) 12, (c) 14, and (d) 16) gemini surfactants and (e)
bar diagram at 298 K (pH 7.8).

Among the four peaks, peak 1 relates to the first-order Rayleigh
scattering, and peak 4 associates to the second-order Rayleigh scattering.36 Peak 2 (λex = 280 nm, λem = 340 nm) indicates the spectral behavior of Trp and Tyr,
predominantly attributed to π–π* transitions of
aromatic residues in the α-CHT, whereas peak 3 (λex = 225 nm, λem = 340 nm) depicts the spectral
properties of a polypeptide backbone structure C=O (owing to
n−π* transitions). Changes in peaks 2 and 3 demonstrate
protein conformational alterations in the presence of a ligand. Figure 5 and Table 1 demonstrate that the fluorescence
intensities of peaks 2 and 3 of the 3-D spectra of α-CHT get
altered with the addition of gemini surfactants; this ascertains the
conformational alterations in the polypeptide backbone and microenvironment
also around the Tyr and Trp residues due to the binding of surfactants
to α-CHT.37

2.1.6 CD Spectral Studies
CD spectroscopy
is among the utmost frequently employed methods for identifying the
secondary conformation variations of proteins when combining with
ligands, allowing the visualization of conformational changes in the
3-D structure of the protein.38 The assessment
of far-UV CD spectra (190–240 nm) has been utilized to predict
the content of various secondary conformation elements in proteins.
Gorbunoff and Ettinger determined the CD spectrum of the α-CHT
in 1971.39 Presently, CD spectral analysis
has been performed at various concentrations of geminis to investigate
the alteration in the α-CHT conformation. The CD spectrum of
the α-CHT (Figure 6) shows only one negative band at around 202–205 nm and no
positive band.40 The CD spectra of the
α-CHT are due to the amide chromophore; the secondary structure
as evaluated by CD counts amide–amide interactions, a slightly
distinct number from counting residues in X-ray diffraction structures.
This amide chromophore usually starts absorbing far into the UV region
with the first band at around 220 nm. The α-CHT that is the
kind of all β-proteins depicted by a CD spectrum is analogous
to that of a random coil conformation.41 Crystal structure information of the α-CHT demonstrates that
its antiparallel pleated sheets are either highly distorted or form
quite short irregular strands. This anomaly may affect the negative
CD band to move toward 200 nm from the optimal β-sheet position
(210–220 nm).42

Figure 6 CD spectra of α-CHT
(40 μM) in the absence and presence
of Cm-E2O-Cm (m = (a) 12, (b) 14, and (c) 16) gemini surfactants
and (d) bar diagram at 298 K (pH 7.8).

The segment contents of various secondary conformations of the
α-CHT without and with gemini surfactants have been determined
to promote the BeStSel software, which is accessible at http://bestsel.elte.hu,43 and then complete fraction variations are listed
in Table 2. With the
addition of Cm-E2O-Cm gemini surfactants, we see a diminishing pattern of the
α-helix content and rising in the β-antiparallel sheet.
The results indicate that the geminis could change the secondary conformation
and unfold the protein skeleton. The conformational alterations here
imply the enhanced reveal of some hydrophobic localities that were
previously submerged and surfactant combination with the amino acid
residues of the main polypeptide chain of the α-CHT and draining
of their hydrogen bonding networks.28 These
results are compatible with the above outcomes of the synchronous
fluorescence.

2.1.7 Resonance Rayleigh Scattering
(RRS) Studies
The RRS spectral technique is yet another analytical
method that
is recognized for its high sensitivity and effortlessness. RRS is
employed to analyze the biological macromolecule interactions and
molecular identification. It is highly sensitive to the interactions
between the macromolecule and the ligand realized by the weak binding
forces, including hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic attraction,
and hydrogen bonding.44,45 The RRS spectra of the α-CHT
with and without the cationics are inscribed by synchronous scanning
with Δλ = 0 nm in the wavelength range of 280–800
nm. Figure S1 (Supporting Information)
demonstrates that the weak RRS intensities of the α-CHT unexpectedly
increase after adding the geminis; this reveals protein–surfactant
interaction. The observed increase in intensity is due to the larger
size of the α-CHT–Cm-E2O-Cm complex.

All of the above studies (UV–vis,
FT-IR, CD, extrinsic, SFS, three-dimensional, and RRS fluorescence)
have provided good evidence for the conformational changes of the
α-CHT due to the α-CHT–Cm-E2O-Cm complex formation, and we will
probe more of the interaction mechanism.

2.2 Investigations
on the Interaction Mechanism
We have used the fluorescence
spectra to investigate the interaction
mode, binding parameters, and feasibility of mechanism for the interaction
between the α-CHT and the Cm-E2O-Cm gemini surfactants. Furthermore, molecular
docking summarizes the binding site and hydrogen bonds, and DFT analysis
investigates the energy gap values (ΔE) of
the HOMO–LUMO molecular orbitals of the donor–acceptor
ligands.

2.2.1 Effect of Concentration of Gemini Surfactants
on Fluorescence Quenching
Intrinsic fluorescence is delicate
to microenvironmental changes of proteins; consequently, it is usually
utilized to analyze the dynamics, conformation, and intermolecular
interactions between proteins/macromolecules and ligands.46 Proteins generally have fluorescence due to
the aromatic amino acid residues such as Phe, Tyr, and Trp. Fluorescence
of the Phe residue is neglected in most cases because it has a meager
quantum yield,47 and therefore, only Tyr
and Trp contribute to the fluorescence emission. However, the intrinsic
fluorescence of the α-CHT is almost wholly contributed by Trp
residues (at 295 nm excitation wavelength)48 due to the quantum yield and environmental sensitivity of Trp being
higher than Tyr.49 Moreover, Trp acts as
a suitable probe due to the presence of the indole ring, which is
favorably sensitive toward its microenvironment. Figure 7 demonstrates the emission
spectra of the α-CHT with and without Cm-E2O-Cm geminis.

Figure 7 Fluorescence emission
spectra of α-CHT in the presence of
Cm-E2O-Cm (m = (a) 12, (b) 14, and (c) 16) gemini surfactants at 298
K and pH 7.8.

It should be noted that the absorbances
of the aforementioned cationics
(in the used concentration) at the excitation and emission wavelengths
of the α-CHT are much lower, and accordingly, correction factors
for the inner filter are close to 1. Consequently, for the inner-filter
effect in the quenching process, we have utilized eq 1 to correct the fluorescence intensity
of the α-CHT.50 1  where Fcorr and Fobs are the corrected
fluorescence intensity and observed intensity, respectively, and Aem and Aex are the
respective absorbance values of the cationics at emission and excitation
wavelengths of the α-CHT.

2.2.2 Mode
of Fluorescence Quenching
Some procedures can provide confidential
information to the reduction
in the fluorescence intensity, that is, quenching. These procedures
take place during the excited state or may be due to the interaction
between the protein and the ligand in the ground state. It seems to
be dynamic, ensuing from collisions between the fluorophore and quencher,
or static, resulting from the ground-state complex formation between
the fluorophore and the quencher.51 For
fluorescence quenching, molecular contact is required between the
fluorophore and the quencher in each case. Utilizations of the fluorescence
quenching procedure can show the availability of the fluorophores
to quenchers. To illuminate the quenching mechanism of the formation
of the α-CHT–Cm-E2O-Cm complex formation, the Stern–Volmer
equation (eq 2) was utilized
for the analysis of fluorescence data: 2  where F0 and F represent the respective fluorescence
intensities without and with a quencher, respectively, KSV is the Stern–Volmer quenching constant, kq is the bimolecular quenching rate constant,
and τ0 (∼2.96 × 10–9 s) is the average lifetime of fluorophore in the absence of a quencher.52 Other than KSV, kq additionally delineates the kind of quenching
concerned with the binding procedure for dynamic quenching; the most
extreme value feasible for the scattering collision quenching constant
of numerous quenchers is ∼1010 M–1 s–1.51

The Stern–Volmer
plots (Figure 8) show
excellent linearity in the explored concentration zone, signifying
that the observed quenching processes are accountable for only one
type of quenching mechanism, either static or dynamic. The results
(Table 3) demonstrated
that the KSV values increase with chain
length in the order of C16-E2O-C16 > C14-E2O-C14 > C12-E2O-C12, the cause
of the enhanced hydrophobic character influenced by the higher homologues.
Further, the values of kq for the geminis
that are more significant than the diffusion-controlled limit (i.e., kq max ≈ 1010 M–1 s–1)51 recommend that
the ground-state complexation (static quenching mechanism) was initiated
by the quenching mechanism of the α-CHT in the presence of gemini
surfactants rather than by dynamic collision (dynamic quenching mechanism).

Figure 8 Stern–Volmer
plots for the binding of α-CHT with Cm-E2O-Cm (m = 12, 14,
and 16) gemini surfactants at 298 K (pH 7.8).

2.2.3 Analysis of Binding Parameters
and Feasibility
of the Interaction
To measure the binding stabilities of
the α-CHT–Cm-E2O-Cm complexes, the modified Stern–Volmer
equation (eq 3) was utilized53 to evaluate the binding constants (Kb) and binding sites (n), which supports
the knowledge of what extent a micellar medium can perform as a suitable
carrier. 3  Figure 9 demonstrates that the double-logarithmic
plots log[(F0 – F)/F] versus log[Cm-E2O-Cm] (modern Stern–Volmer plot) yield a
straight line in every case, whose slope is n. The
values of Kb, n, and R′2 (adjusted coefficients of determination)
are indexed in Table 3. For α-CHT–Cm-E2O-Cm complex formation, the number of binding sites
is approximately equivalent to 1, suggesting the availability of a
single binding site for the gemini surfactants in the α-CHT.
The binding constant (Kb) results in the
order of C16-E2O-C16 > C14-E2O-C14 > C12-E2O-C12, which demonstrates
that C16-E2O-C16 has the highest binding strength,
whereas C12-E2O-C12 holds the least effective
binding affinity. This pattern is comparable to that of KSV, elucidating that hydrophobicity acts an important
function in the formation of the α-CHT–Cm-E2O-Cm complex.

Figure 9 Plots of log(F0 – F)/F versus log[Cm-E2O-Cm] for quenching of α-CHT by Cm-E2O-Cm (m = 12, 14,
and 16) gemini surfactants; [α-CHT] = 2 μM;
[Cm-E2O-Cm] = 0.0049–0.0867 mM at 298 K and pH 7.8.

Moreover, to check the feasibility of the interactions between
α-CHT and gemini surfactants, the Gibbs free energy values (evaluating
by using the equation ΔGb0 = – 2.303RT log Kb) demonstrate that the interactions
are thermodynamically feasible. Also, the order suggests that the
interaction between the α-CHT and C16-E2O-C16 is more feasible than C12-E2O-C12 and C14-E2O-C14.

2.2.4 Molecular
Docking
The molecular
docking study provides an appropriate way to predict the possible
binding sites. It helps sanction our experimental results and also
verify the types of interactions operating in the protein–surfactant
system. The binding modes of all the three geminis with α-CHT
are observed to be almost similarly located around aromatic residues
(Trp/Tyr) (Figure 10).The free energies of binding (FEB) of −364.9, −412.3,
and −448.5 kJ mol–1 were obtained for C12-E2O-C12 + α-CHT, C14-E2O-C14 + α-CHT, and C16-E2O-C16 + α-CHT,
respectively. The higher value of FEB in the last case signifies a
stronger interaction as compared to the other two geminis. The docking
interaction energy, that is, FEB, should not be tangled with the Gibbs
free energy (ΔGb0), obtained in steady-state fluorescence
spectroscopy. It is applicable to the future only in feasibility considerations.
In the Hex docking, it is presumed that the ligand should be rigid,
which excludes the prospect of conformational entropy predominance.

pose of the α-CHT complexed with (a) C12-E2O-C12, (b) C14-E2O-C14, and (c)
C16-E2O-C16 gemini surfactants.

In addition, the solvent has been removed prior to docking
calculations,
and consequently, general structural entropy impacts are additionally
satisfied. It must be recalled that the Hex 6.1 estimates the energy
of interaction corresponding to the classical internal energy of a
system of point charges. It could be explained as the FEB values being
zero or positive, which means that the protein and ligand are infinite
separations and, if these are negative scores, then favor good surface
contact between the protein (α-CHT) and the ligand (surfactant).
The noncompatibility in FEB and ΔGb0 has also been
ascribed to the exclusion of solvent in docking simulations or the
X-ray structure of proteins as crystals differ from the protein acquired
in the aqueous system.54 It was observed
that the gemini surfactants lie at close proximity of aromatic residues
with approximate distances being C12-E2O-C12 → Trp 215.C = 2.9 Å, Trp 172.G = 2.5 Å, Tyr 95.C
= 9.2 Å; C14-E2O-C14 → Trp 215.C
= 2.7 Å, Trp 172.G = 4.8 Å, Tyr 171.C = 4.7 Å; and
C16-E2O-C16 → Trp 215.C = 2.7 Å,
Trp 172.G = 2.7 Å, Tyr 171.C = 5.2 Å.55 This close congruity suggests the probability of both hydrophilic
and hydrophobic interactions.56 The first
interaction generates between the surfactant headgroups and negatively
charged residues on the protein surface, and the last interactions
are generally between the aromatic moieties of α-CHT and gemini
surfactant tails and hydrophilic interactions. Moreover, hydrogen
bonds act as a major character in the binding reaction along with
van der Waals interactions, which can be seen between N of His-57.G
and H of the gemini surfactant tail (Figure 11).

2.2.5 DFT Calculations
Electrostatic
potential analysis was made for individual gemini surfactant and aromatic
residues (Trp/Tyr) using B3LYP/6-31**G(d,p) basis set DFT calculations
(Figure 12). MEP (electrostatic
potential map) represents the electrostatic potential strength where
red regions are the most electronegative areas and, on the other hand,
blue regions are the most electropositive areas. In the gemini surfactants,
the electronegative region was found near the chloride ion and electropositive
region near cationic nitrogen. Similarly, in the case of Trp and Tyr,
the electronegative region was located near the carboxylate group
and electropositive region near the aromatic residue. This suggests
that the possible interaction is between cationic nitrogen of Cm-E2O-Cm and aromatic
residue of Trp/Tyr and might also be in between the chloride ion of
Cm-E2O-Cm and
the carboxylate group of Trp/Tyr.

Figure 12 Electrostatic potential map representing
the electrostatic potential
strength of (a) gemini surfactant (C12-E2O-C12) and (b) Trp and (c) Tyr residues of α-CHT.

By obtaining the optimized structure and HOMO → LUMO,
HOMO-1,
and LUMO+1 for Cm-E2O-Cm and aromatic residues (Trp/Tyr) of α-CHT, it was
observed that the LUMO energy of Trp and Tyr molecules is very high
due to the electron-withdrawing carboxylate group (Figure 13). The electronic cloud and
LUMO energy of gemini surfactants and HOMO of Trp and Tyr residues
are in agreement with MEP as the electrostatic interactions are also
applicable between the cationic nitrogen portion of gemini surfactants
and the aromatic residue of Trp/Tyr.57 Furthermore,
on cautious perception of energy gap values of the concerned molecular
orbitals, it is obvious that the concerned molecular orbitals have
lower energy gap (ΔE) values, recommending
significant interactions between the frontier molecular orbitals (FMO);58 this perception is in incongruity with the postulate
of FMO theory. According to FMO theory, interactions are conceivable
only when the energy gap values are not extremely high between the
molecular frontier orbitals. In other words, lesser ΔE values are the indications of electronic interactions
among the FMOs. From the FMO diagram of Cm-E2O-Cm and aromatic residues (Figure 13), it has been
observed that the HOMO–LUMO separation between C16-E2O-C16 and aromatic residues is smaller as compared
to C12-E2O-C12 and C14-E2O-C14, which makes C16-E2O-C16 a more favorable
binder followed by C14-E2O-C14 than C12-E2O-C12. On the other hand, the relatively lower energy
unoccupied orbital of C16-E2O-C16 and the relatively
high energy filled orbital of aromatic residues reveal that the most
favorable interaction is between the cationic nitrogen portion of
Cm-E2O-Cm and
the aromatic residue of Trp/Tyr.

3 Conclusions
The
binding study of surfactant with protein has enormous significance
in pharmacy, pharmaceuticals, industry, drug delivery, and biotechnology.
In this paper, the interaction of serine protease α-CHT with
oxy-diester-functionalized Cm-E2O-Cm gemini surfactants was studied by spectroscopic
methods including fluorescence, CD, FT-IR and UV–vis spectroscopy,
in addition to molecular docking and DFT. Intrinsic fluorescence was
employed to evaluate the quenching constant (KSV) whose values are 3.6 × 103, 3.81 ×
103, and 4.17 × 103 M–1 for C12-E2O-C12, C14-E2O-C14, and C16-E2O-C16, respectively. The
spectroscopic results acquired on the interactions of α-CHT
with gemini surfactants revealed that Cm-E2O-Cm interacted strongly with α-CHT.
The binding constants (Kb) of three surfactants
(C12-E2O-C12, C14-E2O-C14, and C16-E2O-C16) were calculated (1.07 ×
103, 1.46 × 103, and 2.16 × 103 M–1, respectively), and spontaneity was
observed as shown by negative values of ΔGb0. The results of
other spectroscopic techniques (namely, pyrene, synchronous, RRS,
3-D, UV–vis, FT-IR, and CD spectroscopy) stipulate the changes
in the microenvironment and secondary structure of the α-CHT
upon binding with Cm-E2O-Cm gemini surfactants. Molecular docking and DFT results
have confirmed the involvement of hydrophobic/hydrophilic forces (hydrogen
bonds and van der Waals interactions) and the binding of geminis in
the vicinity of hydrophobic residues (Trp/Tyr) of the α-CHT.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
α-Chymotrypsin
(type
II, lyophilized powder) from bovine pancreas-type, essentially salt-free
powder (molecular weight: 25 kDa) and pyrene (98%) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (USA) and Acros Organics (Belgium), respectively.
Sodium monobasic phosphate (98%) and sodium dibasic phosphate (99%)
were purchased from Merck (USA). The dimeric gemini surfactants 2,2′-[(oxybis(ethane-1,2-diyl))bis(oxy)]bis(N-alkyl-N,N-dimethyl-2-oxoethanaminium
dichlorides (Cm-E2O-Cm) used in this study were synthesized by the procedure described
in the literature.21 The chemical structures
and CMC values (reported) of Cm-E2O-Cm gemini surfactants are afforded respectively
in Scheme 1a–c
and Table S1 (Supporting Information).

4.2 Preparation of Stock Solutions
One
milligram of α-CHT (25 kDa) was dissolved in 1 mL of 20 mM phosphate
buffer (pH 7.8) and kept for 24 h with incidental mixing to ensure
the formation of a homogeneous solution at 298 K. The α-CHT
concentration was evaluated spectrophotometrically using the molar
extinction coefficient (ε) of 50,000 M–1 cm–1 at 280 nm. The stock solutions of the gemini surfactants
of 1 mM were also prepared in the same buffer. A SYSTRONICS Digital
pH Meter (model MK VI, India) was used for pH measurements. All experiments
were performed in phosphate buffer at room temperature (298 K).

4.3 UV–Vis Absorption Spectroscopy
UV–vis
absorption spectra results evaluated on a PerkinElmer
Lambda 25 UV–vis spectrophotometer outfitted with a 1.0 cm
quartz cell at 298 K were recorded (scan rate, 960 nm/min; scan range,
200–700 nm). Solutions of requisite concentration were prepared
by adding aliquots of surfactant solutions to the native α-CHT
solution.

4.4 Fluorescence Measurements
The fluorescence
spectra were collected with a 1 cm path length cell at 298 K utilizing
a Hitachi Model F-2700 spectrophotometer (Japan) outfitted with a
PC.

For intrinsic emission fluorescence, the parameters were
fixed as a excitation wavelength of 295, an emission wavelength range
of 310–450 nm, excitation and emission slit widths of 5 nm,
a scan rate of 1500 nm/min, and a photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltage
of 400 V, maintaining the concentration of α-CHT constant at
2 μM and surfactant concentrations ranging from 0.004975 to
0.090909 mM.

The synchronous fluorescence spectra (SFS) were
collected in the
synchronous scan mode with offset values of 20 and 60 nm (Δλ
= λem – λex = 20 or 60 nm)
among excitation and emission monochromators to get specific characteristic
information on Tyr and Trp residues, respectively. The widths of excitation
and emission slits were set at 5 nm each, while the scan rate was
1500 nm/min.

For the extrinsic fluorescence, pyrene (3 μM)
was excited
at 336 nm, and emission was observed in the range of 350–450
nm. The emission and excitation slit widths were fixed at 2.5 nm,
each with the scan speed 300 nm/min.

The three-dimensional fluorescence
(3-D) spectra were recorded
in the range of 220–600 nm, setting the emission and excitation
slit widths at 5 nm, each with a 3000 nm/min scan rate.

The
resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS) spectra were recorded for
the α-CHT–Cm-E2O-Cm systems through the wavelength range of 280–700
nm, employing synchronous scanning at Δλ = 0 (i.e., λem = λex).

4.5 FT-IR
Measurements
The FT-IR spectra
were measured utilizing the PerkinElmer Lambda spectrophotometer in
the range of 400–4000 cm–1. Baseline correction
was obliged utilizing the phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) as a blank before
the measurements.

4.6 Circular Dichroism (CD)
Spectroscopy
The far-UV CD spectra of α-CHT and gemini
surfactants were
recorded by utilizing a JASCO-J815 CD spectropolarimeter furnished
with a PC and a quartz cuvette with 10 mm path length. The far-UV
CD spectra were recorded between 190 and 250 nm and with a 40 μM
α-CHT solution. The spectra were accumulated at the scan rate
of 100 nm min–1 with the response time of 1 s and
the bandwidth of 1 nm. The spectropolarimeter was cleansed adequately
with inert N2 gas, and calibration with d-10-camphorsulfonic
acid was performed before and during the measurements. After the proper
baseline correction, the acquired CD spectra are an average of two
successive scans. During the measurements, the temperature was constant
at 298 K.

4.7 Molecular Docking
To study the behavior
of molecular interaction between the ligand (gemini surfactant) and
the protein (α-CHT), Hex 6.1 software was used59 with shape + DARS + electrostatic correlation, and Grid:
118X118X118. PDB file of α-CHT with code 4CHA was downloaded
from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org), while mol files of Cm-E2O-Cm gemini surfactants were
developed by using ChemDraw Ultra 12.0 and converted into PDB format
by using Chimera. Visualization of docking pose was obtained using
Chimera software (http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera). The overall docking experiment was run on a processor (Intel Core
i5-4200U CPU @ 1.60 GHz, 2.10 GHz, 2.30 GHz, 64-bit).

4.8 DFT Studies
All the density functional
theory calculations to study the interaction between gemini surfactant
and hydrophobic residues (Trp/Tyr) of α-CHT were obtained through
B3LYP/6-31**G(d,p) basis set (Becke’s three-parameter hybrid
exchange function with Pople basic set) using the Gaussian 09 program.60 The electrostatic potential map (MEP) of optimized
structures, HOMO and LUMO, were also obtained. The visualization of
investigated structures was done using ChemCraft1.5 software.61
