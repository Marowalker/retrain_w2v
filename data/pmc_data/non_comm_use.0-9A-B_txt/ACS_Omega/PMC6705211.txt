H3K9me3 (methylation of lysine 9
of histone H3) is an epigenetic
modification that acts as a repressor mark. Several diseases, including
cancers and neurological disorders, have been associated with aberrant
changes in H3K9me3 levels. Different tools have been developed to
enable detection and quantification of H3K9me3 levels in cells. Most
techniques, however, lack live cell compatibility. To address this
concern, we have engineered recombinant protein sensors for probing
H3K9me3 in situ. A heterodimeric sensor containing a chromodomain
and chromo shadow domain from HP1a was found to be optimal in recognizing
H3K9me3 and exhibited similar spatial resolution to commercial antibodies.
Our sensor offers similar quantitative accuracy in characterizing
changes in H3K9me3 compared to antibodies but claims single cell resolution.
The sensor was applied to evaluate changes in H3K9me3 responding to
environmental chemical atrazine (ATZ). ATZ was found to result in
significant reductions in H3K9me3 levels after 24 h of exposure. Its
impact on the distribution of H3K9me3 among cell populations was also
assessed and found to be distinctive. We foresee the application of
our sensors in multiple toxicity and drug-screening applications.

Introduction
DNA in high eukaryotes
is packaged into a highly organized chromatin
structure. The conventional wisdom suggesting that the underlying
genomic sequence encodes the cell fate is fundamentally challenged
with the recent revelation of stem cell lineage data.1 This data suggest that distinctive cell types, for example,
epithelial and mesenchymal cells, share almost identical genomic information
and gain their respective cell identity by differential usage of genomic
information, for example, different expression patterns of transcriptional
factors and chromatin remodeling regulators.2 For example, during an epithelial mesenchymal transition,3 cell reprogramming occurs first via changes in
epigenetic marks, that is, H3K9me3 (tri-methylation of lysine 9 of
histone H3).4 Transcription factors, for
example, OCT4 and NANOG, essential
for maintaining pluripotency, are then epigenetically repressed.5−7 These changes can result in large-scale re-arrangement of chromatin8,9 that subsequently lead to an altered phenotype.

Different
chromatin regions, that is, active (transcriptionally
“on”) and silenced (transcriptionally “off”)
chromatin, are identified via DNA staining (e.g., DAPI, C-, G-, Q-,
and N-banding10) in cytohistology. Silenced
chromatin, also known as heterochromatin, has a higher DNA density
and consists primarily of permanently silenced genes. Methylation
of histones, that is, H3K9me3, is a hallmark of heterochromatin.11 Characterizing and understanding H3K9me3 distributions
can thus provide crucial insights about heterochromatin organization
in cells. Although spatial distribution of H3K9me3 is expected to
at least partially correlate with the DNA density, that is, identified
via DAPI staining, differences exist. For example, a recent study
has shown that an H3K9me3-enriched region of chromosome X can only
be weakly stained via DAPI.12 Other than
marking of heterochromatin regions, spatial distribution of H3K9me3
also carries important gene regulation information. For example, in
the primary hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, H3K9me3 is preferentially
localized to the nuclear periphery with a small number of foci in
the center of a nucleus.13 Mature cells
lacking differentiation capability, however, exhibit a more pericentric
distribution of H3K9me3.13 Aberrant changes
in the global level14,15 and spatial distribution15 of H3K9me3 are commonly observed in many diseases,
for example, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. A more direct
approach for characterizing H3K9me3 is thus needed for tracking transcriptionally
silenced and/or repressed regions, as well as monitoring chromatin
re-arrangement and epigenetic re-programming during cell differentiation
and disease development.

Limited approaches exist for monitoring
H3K9me3 distribution and
changes. Immuno-histochemistry, that is, immuno-fluorescence imaging,
is commonly used to reveal the distribution of H3K9me3. This approach,
however, can only be applied to fixed cells and is further constrained
by the availability and quality of commercial antibodies, which is
becoming an increasing concern in recent literature studies.16 Several novel probes have been developed in
recent years that are live-cell-compatible. Briefly, both Fabs- and
Mintbody-based approaches utilize fragments derived from the antibody.17,18 A lengthy development process which involves the production of specific
IgG and scFv libraries is typically required.19,20 Although these approaches have been successfully applied to detect
several epigenetic changes (e.g., H4K20me and H3K9ac),17,21,22 they have not been used to detect
H3K9me3. A FRET-based sensor utilizing a H3K9me3 reader domain [i.e.,
heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a)]23 was
developed to monitor intracellular H3K9me3 levels. This sensor relies
on the use of a reporter histone H3 conjugated to the recognition
motif and thus does not provide any information about the spatial
distribution of endogenous H3K9me3. Recently, a H3K9me3 sensor based
on human HP1β was reported.24 In
comparison to other HP1 homologs, HP1β has a relatively high
affinity for H3K9me3 (KD = 3 ± 1
μM), while for HP1α and HP1γ, this is of 13 ±
1 and 7 ± 2 μM, respectively.25 Despite its high affinity, image analysis of cells transfected with
HP1β-GFP and costained with the H3K9me3 antibody, showed that
they do not colocalize with all H3K9me3 foci within the cell.26,27 Recently, it was reported that HP1β is capable of binding
to H4K20me3 and thus provides an explanation for its lacking of specificity.28

We thus engineered a H3K9me3 sensor using
functional domains derived
from HP1a fused with a fluorescent protein. A heterodimer sensor linking
chromodomain (CD) (ΔCD) and chromo shadow domain (ΔCSD)
was found to be the most effective in colocalizing with H3K9me3. It
is recognized that the most optimum sensor design resembles native
protein binding motifs but lacks a hinge domain. Comprehensive validation
was carried out both in situ and in vitro to confirm their suitability
in epigenetic studies which has not been done previously in the literature.
The sensor can be used to monitor changes in H3K9me3 in single cells
with a comparable spatial resolution to commercial antibodies. We
have demonstrated the application of our sensor in monitoring cellular
responses to an epigenetic drug (BIX-01294) and an environmental chemical
(atrazine, an herbicide).

Results and Discussion
Engineering H3K9me3 Sensors
In this work, we engineered
various H3K9me3 sensors derived from CD (ΔCD) and chromo-shadow
domain (ΔCSD) of HP1a. All protein sensors were subcloned into
a mammalian expression vector and fused to an enhanced green fluorescent
protein, allowing us to monitor changes in H3K9me3 in live cells.
It is important to note that although we conserved the primary sequence
of ΔCD and ΔCSD in our design, the hinge domain was intentionally
left out for enhanced selectivity and the probes as constructed vary
from the native HP1a sequence. All sensors were successfully transfected
via lipofectamine, expressed and enriched in the cell nucleus. NLS–mEGFP
lacking the “reader” motif was used as a negative control.
Typical images of HEK293T cells transfected with various sensor constructs
and the negative control are shown in Figure 1. Additional images of sensor-transfected
cells can be found in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). Cells transfected with ΔCSD and ΔCSD−ΔCSD
sensors exhibit a diffusive pattern inside the nucleus with no “speckle”
or “island” features as we would expect for H3K9me3-rich
regions. The same pattern was also observed in cells transfected with
the negative control. Sensors containing ΔCD (i.e., ΔCD,
ΔCD−ΔCD, and ΔCD−ΔCSD), on the
other hand, show distinctive patterns that potentially resemble the
distribution of H3K9me3 in HEK293T cells.

Figure 1 Representative images
of HEK293T cells transfected with monomeric
and dimeric constructs of H3K9me3 sensors. All cells were imaged 24
h post transfection. All images are 2D confocal slides of cells.

To select among them and identify the sensor that
is highly selective
in recognizing H3K9me3, we costained transfected cells with an anti-H3K9me3
antibody. Confocal images of costained cells are summarized in Figure 2A [additional images
can be found in Figure S2A,B (Supporting Information)]. Mander’s colocalization analysis was performed to assess
the degree of colocalization between the antibody and our probes.
The results are summarized in Figure 2B. Mander’s coefficients, namely M1 and M2, represent the fraction
of the antibody co-localized with our sensors and vice versa, respectively.29 Having Mander’s coefficients close to
1 suggests perfect colocalization. Among all probes, ΔCSD and
ΔCSD−ΔCSD do not colocalize with H3K9me3 antibodies.
All three probes containing ΔCD exhibit a certain level of colocalization
with H3K9me3 antibodies. Among them, ΔCD−ΔCD and
ΔCD−ΔCSD sensors have the highest values of M1 and M2. A closer
comparison between ΔCD−ΔCD and ΔCD−ΔCSD
sensors suggests that ΔCD−ΔCSD exhibits a lower
dispersion of M1 and M2 coefficients. We further analyzed the intensity profiles
of both probes and compared them to the antibody-stained images as
shown in Figure S2C (Supporting Information). Qualitatively, both probes capture a similar trend in intensity
changes as the antibody. Between them, ΔCD−ΔCSD
exhibits a closer match in the intensity profile. We thus proceeded
to evaluate the potential of ΔCD−ΔCSD as a live
cell sensor for H3K9me3. Although similar findings have been reported
in the biological literature,30−32 our work is the first to apply
this engineered design for quantifying the endogenous H3K9me3 modification
level.

correlation analysis was performed between sensor and antibody-stained
images. Coefficients of colocalization, namely M1 and M2, were reported in a scattered
bar plot and summarized in the table underneath, n = 100.

To verify that the observed fluorescence
signal arises from specific
binding of our sensors to H3K9me3, we introduced mutations to the
CDs of our ΔCD−ΔCSD sensor. Specifically, we mutated
the conserved residues at positions 42–43 of our sensor from
KW to AA. This mutant has been shown to result in the loss of H3K9me3
binding affinity in the literature.33 The
mutant sensor, ΔCD (KW42/43AA)−ΔCSD, can be successfully
transfected and translocated into the nucleus but exhibits no H3K9me3-like
features as shown in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). This observation confirms that the fluorescent patterns observed
in transfected cells, that is, as shown Figures 1 and S1 (Supporting Information), can be attributed to the specific binding of our sensors to H3K9me3
in the cell chromatin.

An in vitro binding assay was performed
to characterize the affinity
and selectivity of ΔCD−ΔCSD. The affinity measurements
were performed using Bio-Layer Interferometry (methods detailed in
Supporting Methods (Supporting Information)). Synthetic histone peptides with sequences detailed in Table S1
(Supporting Information) was used as binding
substrates. The Kd value of our sensor
was found to be ∼0.24 μM and 1.4 mM for H3K9me3 and H3WT
peptides, respectively, as shown Figure S4 (Supporting Information). We also tested our sensor using H3K9me2-containing
peptides. Although our sensors still exhibit a preference to H3K9me3,
it binds to H3K9me2 at a reduced affinity of ∼0.54 μM.
Thus, our sensor has a high affinity for H3K9me3 and a high selectivity
between H3K9me3 and unmodified H3, although modest binding was also
observed for H3K9me2.

Cytotoxicity of Protein Sensors
To evaluate the potential
cytotoxicity of the selected protein sensor, we assessed the effects
of transfected probes on cell growth and viability. We followed transfected
cells for a total duration of ∼60 h post-transfection. At least
92% of transfected cells in the control remain viable within our observation
window and maintain a normal growth pattern [Figure S5 (Supporting Information)]. The proliferation rate
of transfected cells (doubling time of 19.4 ± 0.5 h) was slightly
lowered compared to untransfected ones (doubling time of 18.6 ±
0.5 h). The difference, however, was found not statistically significant
(p > 0.05). In addition, cells transfected with
either
ΔCD−ΔCSD or its mutant, ΔCD (KW42/43AA)−ΔCSD,
present a similar morphology [Figures 1 and S3 (Supporting Information)], suggesting that the specific binding of our sensor minimally
disrupted the cell morphology.

Track H3K9me3 in Live Cells
Single-cell images of transfected
cells were collected for ∼60 h after transfection. Grid slides
were used to ensure that we image the same area at different time
points, following a procedure that we detailed in our previous publication34 and briefly illustrated in Figure S6 (Supporting Information). The time course of two
individual cells (marked as 1 and 2) is shown in Figure 3. Cell 1 (Figure 3, top row) undergoes division
within 48 and 60 h of observation with significant alterations in
chromatin organization. Cell 2 (Figure 3, bottom row) undergoes division twice, once between
24 and 28 h and then between 48 and 60 h of observation. Resulting
cells are identified as (2A and 2B, and 2B_1 and 2B_2). The observed
changes in sensor distributions are consistent with the expected H3K9me3
distribution changes along the cell cycle.35 Thus, daughter cells from the transfected ones were able to continuously
express H3K9me3 sensors and highlight features in H3K9me3. The transfected
cells were then able to retain the fluorescence signal for >60
h,
enabling live-cell tracking.

probes and
tracked for 60 h. Cell images were collected at 60× at areas
specified in Figure S6 (Supporting Information). Scale bar = 10 μm.

Quantifying Changes in H3K9me3 Using Fluorescence Imaging
So far, we have demonstrated that we can track H3K9me3 in live
cells. We then proceeded to determine the quantitative accuracy of
our H3K9me3 sensor. To do that, HEK293T cells were treated with BIX-01294
to reduce H3K9me3 levels. Transfected cells undergoing treatments
were imaged and then lysed. Cell extracts were analyzed using an immunoassay,
as shown in Figure S7A (Supporting Information) to reveal relative changes in H3K9me3 [Figure S7B (Supporting Information)]. Meanwhile, fluorescent
images of cells (Figure 4A) were analyzed for the same purpose. We used two approaches to
analyze the collected fluorescent images, namely, a volume fraction
(volume %) analysis and a foci intensity analysis. Volume fraction
analysis utilizes the 3D stacks of the collected images. This analysis
characterizes the relative abundance of H3K9me3 within a nucleus and
is thus expected to be a good reflection of cellular H3K9me3 levels.
Similar analysis was used previously in the literature.36 A foci intensity analysis uses 2D projection
of all stacks as shown in Figure S8 (Supporting Information). We integrated the intensity of all foci within
a cell nucleus to obtain the integrated foci intensity per nuclei
(IFIN). The IFIN is equivalent to the fluorescence intensity above
the diffusive background and is thus expected to correlate with the
number of probes binding specifically to its target (i.e., H3K9me3)
and reflect the overall H3K9me3 level of individual cells. The probability
distribution of volume fraction and IFIN is plotted in Figure 4B. The probability histogram
for the volume % shows a normal distribution shape. Conversely, for
the integrated foci intensity, the probability histogram is right-skewed.
We also observed potential narrowing in distribution and the rise
of a subpopulation of cells with much lower H3K9me3 levels that do
not exist in untreated cell populations. This type of information
is otherwise inaccessible using population-based experiments. The
average values of volume % and IFIN were compared to the untreated
group to determine relative changes in H3K9me3. The calculated numbers
were then compared to the results from our immunoassays as shown in Figure 4C. At 3 μM
of BIX, the reduction in H3K9me3 was found to be 19% (immuno-assay),
18% (volume %), and 35% (IFIN). At 5 μM of BIX, the reduction
was found to be 45% (immuno-assay), 42% (volume %), and 52% (IFIN),
respectively. Despite some observed differences among varying analysis
techniques, they are not found to be statistically different (p > 0.05). The observed changes in H3K9me3 are in close
accordance with the literature reports.37,38 We thus consider
both analysis approaches, namely, a volume fraction (volume %) and
an IFIN analyses, being valid choices to quantify changes in H3K9me3
levels using our H3K9me3 live-cell sensors with a single-cell resolution.

Atrazine Effect on H3K9me3
With a viable single-cell
tool in hand, we proceeded to demonstrate the application of our probes
in monitoring cellular response to an environmental chemical. For
our applications, we demonstrated how cells respond to an organic
compound (atrazine, ATZ) via changes in H3K9me3. HEK293T cells were
treated with 3 and 30 ppb of ATZ for 24 h. Typical images of cells
treated with ATZ can be found in Figure 5A. Histograms of volume % and IFIN under
different treatment conditions are shown in Figure 5B. Our image-based analysis suggests that
H3K9me3 levels were reduced by ∼14–18 and 20–25%
with 3 and 30 ppb of ATZ treatments, respectively (Figure 5C). The probability histogram
for the volume % shows a normal distribution shape, while for the
integrated foci intensity, the probability histogram is right-skewed.
A leftward shift was observed under high ATZ concentrations. These
results reveal that ATZ exposure can significantly lower H3K9me3 in
HEK293T cells. To the best of our knowledge, no previous report has
evaluated the effect of ATZ on H3K9me3 levels using human cells.

Demonstration of in Vitro
Applicability of ΔCD−ΔCSD–mEGFP
Compared to commercial antibodies, recombinant protein sensors
are advantageous because of their lower cost and high reproducibility.
We used recombinant ΔCD−ΔCSD–mEGFP as a
replacement for commercial antibodies and demonstrated its application
in dot blotting and fixed cell staining. To start, we prepared nuclear
cell extracts (NCEs) from HEK293T. Dilution series of NCE were prepared,
dotted on a membrane, bound to the protein sensor, and imaged to quantify
changes in H3K9me3 concentrations. Representative images of dot blots
are shown in Figure S9A (Supporting Information). Images were then analyzed to reveal the linear range of the probe
as shown in Figure S9B (Supporting Information) and Figure 6. Figures 6A and S9B describe the correlation between the intensity
and protein concentrations and RID with
protein concentrations, respectively. A close-to-linear relation was
observed (see Figure 6A inset) in the protein concentrations ranging from 375 to 3000 μg
mL–1 (R2 = 0.995 and
a slop of 0.94 ± 0.04). The signal to noise ratio (SNR) within
this probing range is consistently higher than 3 (Figure 6B), suggesting good signal
quality based on the current standard.39,40

NCEs. (A) Inset shows the linear detection range. (C) Images of fixed
HEK293T cells stained with recombinant ΔCD−ΔCSD–mEGFP.

Staining fixed HEK293T cells with the recombinant
protein sensor
ΔCD−ΔCSD–mEGFP was carried out using a similar
protocol to conventional immunostaining. Figure 6C shows representative images of fixed cells
stained with the protein sensor. Like antibody-stained images (see
also Figures 2A and S2), characteristic features such as isolated
islands, distinctive foci, nuclear periphery, and nucleolus rings
are clearly visible in the stained cells. These observations agree
with what has been reported in the literature, where heterochromatin,
in which H3K9me3 has been recognized as an epigenetic hallmark,11 is mainly positioned at the nuclear periphery,
interacting with the nuclear lamina and presenting around nucleoli.41,42 The isolated islands and foci rich in H3K9me3 have been associated
with the heterochromatin responsible for cell senescence43,44 and pericentromeric regions.45,46

To this end,
we have developed a sensor to probe H3K9me3 levels
in situ and in vitro. The engineered sensors provide spatial resolution
and quantitative accuracy comparable to commercial antibodies but
offer the flexibility of live-cell tracking and lower costs. The probes
were applied to understand how epigenetic drugs and environmental
chemicals can affect H3K9me3 changes at a single cell level. The probes
can be easily extended to study other epigenetic drugs and chemicals
in situ.

Materials and Methods
Development of H3K9me3
Sensors
Lysine methylation in
histones is typically recognized by epigenetic reader domains such
as chromo-, chromobarrel- or tudor domains.47 Among them, the CD of HP1 has high affinities for H3K9me3 (HP1α
(human): KD = 13 ± 3 μM; and
HP1a (Drosophila): KD = 4 ± 1 μM) and high selectivity [KD > 500 μM for unmodified H3 for HP1α
(human) and 1 mM for HP1a (Drosophila)].25,48,49 A survey among
different HP1 orthologs suggests that the CD found in Drosophila melanogaster (HP1a) has the highest reported
affinity and selectivity for H3K9me3.48 We thus chose to work with CDs from HP1a. HP1a is a multidomain
protein containing a CD and a CSD connected by a flexible hinge.50 Although CD is considered to be primarily responsible
for recognizing H3K9me3,25,51 CSD has been reported
to enhance the target recognition by stabilizing the neighboring interactions.30−32 The hinge domain, however, has been shown to interact with ligands
like RNA and DNA and non-histone proteins like deacetylases,32 thus potentially conferring off-target effects.
Based on this, we designed protein sensors using the truncated CD
(ΔCD, containing residues 24–82 from HP1a UniProtKB-P05205)
and/or CSD (ΔCSD, containing residues 147–205 from HP1a
UniProtKB-P05205) lacking the original hinge connector as shown in Figure S10. The flexible hinge was not included
in our design to minimize off-target interactions. Multimeric domain
designs were used to enhance the performance of our sensor, as we
have demonstrated previously.34 The detailed
primary structure of designed sensors is included in Table S2 (Supporting Information). Glycine linkers are
used for connecting two functional domains.

Gene fragments encoding
the monomeric sensor, that is, ΔCD and ΔCSD, were custom-synthesized
(GenScript). Dimeric probes were cloned using compatible restriction
enzyme pairs (i.e., EcoRI, MfeI, and SalI), as we have described in
our previous work.34 The probes were subcloned
into pET-21b (+) and pRK5 vectors for expressing in bacteria and human
cells, respectively. The encoding fragment was verified using gel
electrophoresis [Figure S11 (Supporting Information)] and DNA sequencing. Recombinant protein sensors were expressed
using Escherichia coli host strains
[detailed in Supporting Methods (Supporting Information)].

Mammalian Cell Culture
Human embryonic kidney 293T
(HEK293T) cells were cultured as described previously.34 Briefly, cells were cultured in a Dulbecco modified
Eagle medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 1%
(v/v) of a penicillin–streptomycin solution (Gibco, CA, US)
and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells (3 ×
104 cells per well) were seeded onto μslide 8-well
and grid-500 coverslips (Ibidi, WI, US) for live-cell imaging and
single cell tracking, respectively.

BIX-01294 (Sigma, MO, US)
is a potent histone methyltransferase (HMTase) inhibitor (IC50 = 1.9 μM for G9a and IC50 = 38 μM for GLP)52,53 for reducing cellular H3K9me3 levels.54 Cells were treated with BIX-01294 at a concentration of 0, 3, or
5 μM for 24 h to obtain cell population with different H3K9me3
levels. The exposure dose and duration were selected because they
were found effective in altering histone methylation levels while
cell viability remains minimally perturbed.55 The relative changes in H3K9me3 were also individually characterized
using NCEs via immunoassays [approach detailed in Supporting Methods
(Supporting Information)].

Fluorescent
Microscopy
Cells were imaged using a Nikon
Eclipse Ti-2 inverted microscope using 63×/1.49 NA oil objective.
Images of cells were collected using Nikon EZ-C1 software. To validate
our engineered protein sensor, sensor-transfected cells were fixed,
followed by immunostaining with the H3K9me3 antibody as we have described
previously.34 The anti-H3K9me3 antibody
(ab8898, Abcam, CA, US) was used as a primary and an Alexa 568 coupled
to the goat anti rabbit antibody was used as a secondary (ab175471,
Abcam, CA, US). All collected images were analyzed using ImageJ (NIH)
and/or CellProfiler (BROAD Institute).56

Selection of the Environmental Chemical Treatment
Atrazine
(ATZ, 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-1,3,5-triazine) is an
herbicide widely used in the United States.57 ATZ can affect endogenous hormone signaling pathways and is thus
a potential endocrine disrupting chemical.58−60 ATZ exposure
has been affiliated with DNA hypomethylation in common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.).61,62 Down regulation
of H3K4me3 have also been observed in a mice study.63 Little is known about how ATZ may affect H3K9me3. We treated
HEK293T cells with 3 and 30 ppb of ATZ for 24 h. The treatment dose
was selected because exposure to these doses has shown to alter the
transcriptome of genes associated with the reproductive system function
and development in zebrafish embryos, while minimal mortality and
morphological changes were observed.64 ATZ
of up to 5.936 ppb in community water systems has been reported in
a recent study conducted at Indiana, USA.65 To investigate the ATZ effect on H3K9me3, cells were treated with
ATZ and imaged similar to what we have described for BIX-01294 in
the previous section.

In Vitro Characterization of the Selected
Protein Sensor
To characterize the sensing properties of
selected protein sensors
in vitro, they were expressed as recombinant proteins in an E. coli system and purified individually as described
in the Supporting Information. Briefly,
the protein sensors, ΔCD−ΔCSD and ΔCD−ΔCSD–mEGFP,
were subcloned into a pET-21b(+) vector with a His-tag on its C-terminus.
The quality of the purified protein was verified using SDS-PAGE and
Western blot (Figure S12, Supporting Information). ΔCD−ΔCSD was used to characterize the binding
affinity and selectivity of the probe via Bio-Layer Interferometry.
ΔCD−ΔCSD–mEGFP was used to probe changes
in H3K9me3 levels of cell extracts using dot blots. The blotting membranes
were imaged and analyzed to reveal their integrated density (ID) similar
as described in the literature.66 We defined
the signal as the relative ID (RID) following eq 1 and the SNR following
(eq 2) 1   2  where
IDS, IDB, and
IDSS are the integrated intensity of a sample spot, the
background, and the saturation level, respectively. X̅S and SS stand for the mean
and standard deviation of RID, respectively.
Based on the RID definition, it accounts
for the measured fluorescence intensity emitted by the protein sensor
corrected for run-to-run variations. RID and SNR will thus be used to monitor the accuracy of our dot blot
assays. To further validate the feasibility of our selected protein
sensors, fixed cells were stained with purified ΔCD−ΔCSD–mEGFP
[see Supporting Methods (Supporting Information)], qualitatively analyzed, and compared to conventional immunostaining.

Statistical Analysis
Experimental assays were conducted
using biological triplicates. Ensemble data are presented as average
and standard deviation. Mander’s colocalization coefficients
(M1 and M2) were used to assess similarity in binding patterns. Coste’s
thresholding was used for background correction. Pairwise statistical
difference was analyzed using an ANOVA, followed by the Duncan’s
multiple-range test. Differences between groups were considered significant
when p < 0.05, on OriginPro (OriginLab Corp, Northampton,
MA). Comparisons between distributions where the distribution was
non-normal were made using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test via the Wilcoxon
test function as implemented in R (Version 3.4.0).
