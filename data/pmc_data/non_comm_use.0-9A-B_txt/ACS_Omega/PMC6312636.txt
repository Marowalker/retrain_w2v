The
steady progress made over the past three decades in growing
a variety of inorganic nanomaterials, with discreet control over their
size and photophysical properties, has been exploited to develop several
imaging and sensing applications. However, full integration of these
materials into biology has been hampered by the complexity of delivering
them into cells. In this report, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of a chemically synthesized anticancer peptide to facilitate the rapid
delivery of luminescent quantum dots (QDs) into live cells. We combine
fluorescence imaging microscopy, flow cytometry, and specific endocytosis
inhibition experiments to probe QD–peptide conjugate uptake
by different cell lines. We consistently find that a sizable fraction
of the internalized conjugates does not co-localize with endosomes
or the nuclei. These findings are extremely promising for the potential
integration of various nanomaterials into biological systems.

Introduction
Nanoscale colloids
such as those made of luminescent quantum dots
(QDs) and magnetic nanocrystals, with their unique photophysical properties,
are the cornerstone around which arrays of biological imaging, sensing,
and tracking modalities have been developed, and they are fundamental
to new diagnostics and therapeutic paradigms in precision medicine.1−10 Among the set of developed nanoparticles (NPs) that have a great
potential for advancing biological imaging and sensing, colloidal
QDs are particularly appealing, due to size-tunable broad absorption
spectra, narrow emission profiles, high quantum yield, large achievable
Stoke’s shift, and a remarkable resistance to photobleaching.
These properties when combined make these materials a highly attractive
alternative to organic dyes and fluorescent proteins for use in multicolor
imaging and single molecule tracking.1,5,6,8,11−14 However, despite these promises, use of QDs in intracellular imaging,
sensing, and drug delivery has met several limitations. Indeed, the
size and nature of these nanomaterials often require that they employ
active transport mechanisms to enter cells, which include nonspecific
macropinocytosis and receptor-mediated uptake of these ligand-functionalized
scaffolds. This can result in intracellular sequestration of the delivered
nanomaterials within endosomal compartments. Alternative approaches
that have been explored recently include use of chemical agents to
disrupt endosomes following uptake or mechanical permeabilization
of cell membranes (e.g., microinjection and electroporation).15−18 However, these strategies require the use of exogenous reagents
and stimuli that can induce NP aggregation, cell damage, and release
of endosomal contents; these strategies are problematic or impractical
to deploy in vivo.8,17

Display of cell-penetrating
peptides (CPPs) on the NP surfaces
is an attractive strategy that can potentially promote their transport
across the cell membrane without disrupting the lipid bilayer. Initial
studies have employed several derivatives of the trans-activator of transcription (TAT) peptide from the human immunodeficiency
virus-1 (HIV-1), which was coordinated to the surface of the nanoparticles.17,19−21 Various studies, including our work, have suggested
that NP–CPP conjugates enter cells through a combination of
endocytosis and physical translocation.19,20,22−24 Subsequent work combined CPP
with an endosomal disruption motif in a modular peptide, JB577, to
afford a partial QD-conjugate escape into the cytoplasm of treated
cells.21,25 A similar approach was employed in another
study where the use of arginine-rich PR9 peptide was reported to facilitate
uptake followed by endosomal escape of NPs into the cell cytoplasm.26 An interesting approach that does not rely on
CPPs for uptake has recently been reported by Gonzalez-Gaitan, Matile
and co-workers.27 They used a biotin-modified
polydisulfide coating, which was attached to commercially available
streptavidin-modified QDs. Using confocal fluorescence microscopy
combined with single particle tracking, they showed that incubation
of these QDs with Drosophila S2 cells promoted a sizable uptake and
QD delivery. QD staining was observed in all exposed cells, with an
average of ∼70 QDs delivered per probed cell. Additionally,
most internalized QDs exhibited diffusive mobility and were excluded
from the nucleus. Uptake for this system was attributed to the combination
of two processes, one involving counterion activators and the other
relying on dynamic disulfide exchange with thiols available on cell
membranes.28 These investigations combined
indicate that an effective intracellular delivery system may benefit
from the development of new peptide sequences that can potentially
interact with the cell membranes and enhance intracellular uptake
to regions not limited to endosomes.

Here, we report on the
ability of the de novo designed SVS-1 peptide
to promote a pronounced and rapid uptake of QD–SVS-1 conjugates
into cells. SVS-1 is a lysine-rich 18 amino acid peptide (KVKVKVKVDPPTKVKVKVK-NH2) that was designed to interact with
the negatively charged membranes of cancer cells. It is different
from other often arginine-rich CPPs, such as TAT. Initial results
indicated that a large fraction of SVS-1 incubated with cancer cells
crossed the membrane into the cytoplasm, leading to their lytic destruction.29 Conversely, cells incubated with the peptide
at concentrations smaller than IC50 value (half-maximal
inhibitory concentration) were not affected. It was proposed that
SVS-1 rather enters cells, with the majority of peptides translocating
directly across the membrane into the cytoplasm.30 Since the mechanism and efficiency of peptide uptake tend
to depend on the cargo and cell type, we reasoned that coupling several
copies of SVS-1 to luminescent QDs could mediate their rapid and efficient
internalization into live cells. We test the effects of varying the
QD–SVS-1 valence, nanocrystal size, concentration, incubation
time, and nature of the cells used on the degree of uptake for four
different cell lines. We have also attempted to identify the distribution
of conjugates following uptake and performed preliminary endocytosis
inhibition tests to gain some insights into the mechanistics of the
QD-conjugate intracellular uptake.

Results and Discussion
We prepared three different sets of CdSe–ZnS core–shell
QDs with fluorescence peaks centered at 542, 572, and 618 nm, following
reported protocols.31,32 The absorption profiles along
with a florescence image of the QD dispersions are shown in Figure 1. Phase transfer
of the hydrophobic QDs to aqueous buffers was carried out via a photochemical
ligation strategy in the presence of a mixture of methoxy-terminated
(inert) and amine-terminated (reactive) poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
ligands appended with lipoic acid anchors, LA–PEG–OCH3 and LA–PEG–NH2, respectively.33,34 This affords control over the number of reactive amine groups on
the QD surface, allowing one to tune the number of SVS-1 peptides
per conjugate. QDs with two fractions of LA–PEG–NH2, 5% (5%-QDs) and 10% (10%-QDs), were prepared. The available
amine groups on the QDs were then modified with N-hydroxysuccinamide-3-(3-methyl-2,5-mioxo-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)propionic acid (NHS ester maleimide) and then reacted
with the N-terminal cysteine-modified SVS-1, forming a stable thioether
linkage (see Figure 1b). This is expected to yield a controlled number of SVS-1 per green-emitting
QD, ranging from ∼8–10 for the 5%-QDs to ∼16–20
for the 10%-QDs.35

hydrophilic QDs. (b) Schematics of a QD–SVS-1 conjugate; the
LA−PEG−SVS-1 structure is shown. (c) Representative
fluorescence images showing conjugate internalization by HeLa and
CHO cell lines. Cells were co-incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with
green 5%-QD–SVS-1 at 50 nM and Texas-Red-transferrin marker,
washed, then fixed, and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI). Shown are the images of DAPI (blue, nuclei), endosomes (red),
QDs (green) and the merged images with the differential interference
contrast. Merged images show that the QD signal is distinct from that
of the endosomal marker. Scale bar ∼ 10 μm.

We first probed the ability of the peptide to promote
the delivery
of QDs into different types of cells. Green-emitting QD–SVS-1
conjugates (starting with 5%-QDs) were mixed with Texas-Red-labeled
transferrin protein (serving as an endosome marker) and then co-incubated
with four different mammalian cell lines, HeLa, A549, human umbilical
vein endothelial (HUVEC), and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, for
1 h at 37 °C. The epifluorescence images in Figure 1c show extensive green signal
from the QDs distributed across the cell volume, in particular for
the HeLa cells. Additional images collected from A549 and HUVEC cells
are provided in the Supporting Information, Figure S1. Furthermore, the internalized QDs were homogeneously distributed
throughout the cell volume. Essentially, little to no co-localization
with the endosome marker or nuclear stain was observed, as illustrated
in the merged images shown in Figure 1c, right panels. However, no QD uptake was observed
in control cells incubated with unconjugated QDs (5%-QDs, no peptide)
under the same conditions (see Supporting Information, Figure S2). These results suggest that the SVS-1
peptide can promote the internalization of QDs into mammalian cell
lines, where the conjugates then distribute across the cell volume.

Next, we tested the effects of varying the concentration and incubation
time on the internalization by HeLa and CHO cells using fluorescence
spectroscopy imaging, supplemented by quantification of the uptake
using flow cytometry measurements (additional details on the flow
cytometry data and analysis are provided in the Supporting Information, Figure S3). As illustrated in Figure 2, increased QD internalization
that is commensurate with the conjugate concentration used (from 25
to 75 nM) was measured for HeLa and CHO cells. The fluorescence images
in Figure 2a show concentration-dependent
increase in the QD staining of the cells, whereas the data shown in Figure 2b indicate that significant
levels of conjugate internalization by the cells occurred within 15–30
min of incubation, which confirms that enhanced uptake is facilitated
by the peptides. Furthermore, we measured a more pronounced uptake
of QD–SVS-1 by HeLa cells compared to noncancerous CHO cells
for all concentrations tested (Figure 2c), a finding that is consistent with the reported
higher selectivity of SVS-1 peptide toward cancer cells compared to
normal cell lines.36

Figure 2 (a) Representative fluorescence
images showing the concentration-dependent
uptake of green 5%-QD–SVS-1 conjugates. The cells were co-incubated
with various concentrations of QD–SVS-1 and Texas-Red-transferrin
for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells incubated with QDs at 75 nM show no uptake.
(b) Fluorescence images of HeLa cells incubated with 5%-QD–SVS-1
(50 nM) for 15, 30, 60, and 90 min at 37 °C; co-labeling of the
endosomes with Texas-Red-transferrin (red, 60 min incubation) was
limited to cultures incubated with the conjugates for 60 and 90 min.
Flow cytometry analysis of conjugate internalization for: (c) green
5%-QD–SVS-1 by CHO cells (light gray bars) and HeLa cells (dark
gray bars); (d) green 5%-QD–SVS-1 (light gray bars) and green
10% QD–SVS-1 (gray bars) by HeLa cells; (e) green-(light gray
bars), yellow-(gray bars) and red-(dark gray bars) emitting 5%-QD–SVS-1
conjugates by HeLa cells. All of the flow cytometry measurements were
carried out using incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. Scale bar ∼
10 μm.

We investigated the internalization
with respect to changes in
the QD–SVS-1 conjugate valence by varying the number of peptides
coupled to a QD. Indeed, we found that starting with 10% QDs (expected
to double the valence from ∼10 to ∼20 peptides per QD)
resulted in enhanced internalization by HeLa cells compared to 5%
QDs, as monitored by flow cytometry measurements (Figure 2d). Taken together, these data
clearly prove that the observed internalization is mediated by the
display of SVS-1 peptides on the QDs. The data also demonstrate that
our intracellular QD delivery scheme is effective, efficient, and
rapid while maintaining the selective properties of the peptide.

The effects of varying the QD surface area on the degree of internalization
were investigated by incubating the cells with conjugates prepared
using three nanocrystal sizes (radius ∼3.2, ∼3.4, and
∼3.8 nm for green, yellow, and red QDs, respectively).37,38 In particular, the three sets of 5%-NH2–QDs were
conjugated to SVS-1. By virtue of the increased area with size, this
would yield conjugates with increasing numbers of SVS-1 per nanocrystal
from green to red. We anticipate, based on simple geometrical consideration
and using the density of LA–PEG–NH2 ligands
per QD, that the numbers of coupled peptides per nanocrystal are ∼10,
12, and 15 for green, yellow, and red QDs, respectively, starting
with 5% amine–QDs.35 The experimental
results collected from flow cytometry measurements (shown in Figure 2e) confirm that SVS-1
effectively mediates cellular delivery of QDs with higher uptake for
larger NCs (i.e., larger surface area, red > yellow > green),
as anticipated.
Moreover, the difference in uptake is more pronounced at lower concentrations,
where subsaturation in uptake better reflects the influence of increased
conjugate valence. At higher concentrations, however, the degree of
cellular uptake seems to reach saturation, reducing the effects of
conjugate valence on the degree of uptake. Additional fluorescence
images of HeLa cells incubated with red QD-conjugates are shown in Figure S4. To confirm that the observed QD staining
was indeed emanating from QDs inside the cytoplasm and not originating
from membrane-bound conjugates, we collected a set of confocal microscopy
images from the cell cultures. Representative confocal images of HeLa
cells incubated with green-, yellow-, and red-emitting 5%-QD–SVS-1
conjugates are shown in Figure 3. The images collected from the three sets of QDs strongly
suggest that the QD staining is distributed throughout the cell volumes
and outside the nuclei.

Figure 3 Representative confocal microscopy images collected
from HeLa cells
incubated with 5%-QD–SVS-1 conjugates. The row of images corresponds
to cells incubated with green-(top), yellow-(middle), and red-(bottom)
emitting QD-conjugates at 50 nM for 1 h at 37 °C. Images are
acquired at the indicated position along the z-axis.
Scale bar ∼ 10 μm.

To confirm that the intracellular delivery data collected
using
postuptake fluorescence imaging is not an artifact caused by cell
fixation, we carried out live cell imaging where conjugate internalization
could be tracked in situ. For this, HeLa cells were first incubated
with red-emitting QD–SVS-1 conjugates (starting with 5%-NH2–QDs) at a concentration of 50 nM, then fluorescence
image collection was initiated immediately after exposure to the conjugates
and continued for a period of 30 min (one frame every ∼2.5
min). The compiled video shows that red QD staining could be detected
immediately after exposure to the conjugates and continued to expand
throughout the collection period (see Movie S1). This provides further evidence for the ability of the surface-displayed
peptide to enable the rapid delivery of the QD cargos inside cells.

The above results combined strongly suggest that the lysine-rich,
foldable SVS-1 peptide is very effective in delivering conjugated
QDs into live cells. This has further motivated the idea of testing
whether or not translocation of these conjugates inside the cells
is solely dependent on endocytosis. For this, we carried out three
uptake experiments in the presence of known physical and pharmacological
inhibitors of endocytosis. In the first, the temperature of the cell
culture was adjusted to 4 °C for 40 min, and then incubation
with the QD–peptide conjugates was carried out for an additional
40 min. Lowering the temperature to 4 °C is known to deplete
the cell’s energy, thus eliminating clathrin-mediated endocytosis
as an uptake process.2,20 In the second, we tested the
effects of chemical inhibition. The cell culture was initially pretreated
with sodium azide (NaN3, 10 mM) and 50 mM 2-deoxy-d-glucose for 30 min before incubation with the conjugates. In the
third test, the culture was treated with a hypertonic sucrose solution
(0.4 M) for 1 h, then incubated with the QD–SVS-1 conjugates
for 40 min. The three sets of cell cultures were then fixed and imaged
using epifluorescence microscopy. Incubation with 2-deoxy-d-glucose and NaN3, respectively, inhibits glycolysis and
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, leading to impairment of
ATP production (thus altering the active process of endocytosis).
Conversely, exposure to a hypertonic solution of sucrose specifically
inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis.39−41Figure 4a shows that significant levels of QD staining
are measured inside the cells exposed to the conjugates under all
of the above conditions. Additional flow cytometry measurements of
cells incubated with QD–SVS-1 (5%-QDs) allowed us to compare
the cellular uptake in the presence and absence of endocytosis inhibitory
conditions. Negligible differences were detected in the percentage
of fluorescent cells between treated and nontreated cultures, as shown
in Figure 4b.

We would like to stress that incubation with the conjugates did
not induce any measurable toxicity to the various cells, as confirmed
using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) viability tests. Figure 5 shows that indeed the viability of the cells was essentially
unchanged following incubation with the QD–SVS-1 conjugates
(or QDs alone) over the range of concentrations used in the uptake
experiments.

staining (from flow cytometry measurements) following incubation with

QDs and
QD–SVS-1 conjugates. Green-emitting unconjugated QDs or 5%-QD–SVS-1
conjugates were used.

Finally, we should note that the effectiveness of the SVS-1
peptide
for promoting the rapid uptake of other types of nanomaterials, namely,
Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) and large Au nanorods (AuNRs), has also recently
been reported by our group.42 The metal
nanostructures were coated with a multicoordinating polymer ligand;
such coating promotes long-term steric stability of the nanocrystals,
while providing a large number of reactive amine groups per NP/NR.
This is particularly important for nanorods, which have rather larger
overall size and surface areas, and the polymer provides better interfacing
with the surrounding medium than monomeric ligands. Additionally,
given the fact that AuNPs and AuNRs are inherently not fluorescent
and tend to quench the emission of proximal dyes and other fluorescing
materials, the polymer coating with its multireactive sites was coupled
to a large number of Texas-Red dyes along with several copies of SVS-1.42 This provided the means to visualize the uptaken
AuNP- and AuNR-conjugates. We found that incubation of the Au nanocrystal–SVS-1
conjugates produced rapid and pronounced conjugate delivery, yielding
extended red staining across the cell volumes. The homogenous and
extensive staining was excluded from the cell nuclei. Furthermore,
endocytosis inhibition experiments, similar to those performed here
for the QDs, were carried out, namely, using incubation at 4 °C,
pretreatment in the presence of 2-deoxy-d-glucose and NaN3 mixture, or with sucrose. A pronounced uptake of AuNP- and
AuNR-conjugates was measured under those conditions, a result consistent
with the data shown in Figure 4 above.

Conclusions
In summary, our results
combining fluorescence imaging, flow cytometry,
and endocytosis inhibition measurements show that the membrane-active
peptide (SVS-1) can promote rapid and pronounced delivery of QD-conjugates
into live cells. The intracellular uptake can further be controlled
by varying the conjugate concentration, density of surface-displayed
peptides, and nature of the cell lines, with cancerous cell cultures
exhibiting higher degree of internalization than noncancerous ones.
Importantly, the internalized QDs do not show co-localization with
apo-transferrin endosome marker, and uptake of these QD nanomaterials
persists when incubation was carried out in the presence of certain
endocytosis inhibitors. Nonetheless, because apo-transferrin marker
is known to primarily label the recycling endosomes of cells, interaction
with other types of endocytic vesicles cannot be discarded. These
findings, though preliminary, are promising as they open up new possibilities
for addressing the limitations currently encountered in delivering
various nanomaterials into live cells, without relying on endocytosis.
Our scheme offers a more facile and potentially direct approach for
the rapid intracellular delivery of nanoconjugates into various cell
lines. Our studies suggest that one of the possible mechanisms of
cell entry could involve direct translocation across the membrane.43 Nonetheless, further studies are needed to fully
understand the mechanism governing the cellular uptake.

We would
also like to mention that the QD staining, though distributed
across the cells, also seems to be punctate. This could be promoted
by postinternalization interactions of the peptide with the membrane-enclosed
organelles. To gain further understanding of the exact mechanism,
test its effectiveness for promoting the uptake of other nanomaterials,
we are performing additional studies to co-label the subcellular organelles
and identify any post internalization interactions. Use of other nanoparticle-SVS-1
conjugates (e.g., AuNPs and AuNRs),42 combined
with high-resolution imaging tools, like transmission electron microscopy
and scanning electron microscopy, will expand the applicability of
this approach and further provide additional information on the localization
and uptake mechanism. Finally, exploring the use of mixed surface
conjugates combining SVS-1 with other biomolecules (such as mRNA and
DNA) will allow us to expand on existing platforms for subcellular
delivery.

Experimental Section
QD Growth and Ligand Exchange
The
CdSe–ZnS core–shell
QDs used in this study were prepared in two steps.31 The CdSe core was grown first by reduction of cadmium and
selenium organometallic precursors at high temperature (300–350
°C) and in coordinating solvent mixtures made of alkylphosphines,
alkyphosphine-carboxyl, and alkylamines. This was followed by overcoating
the CdSe core with a ZnS shell, also using organometallic (zinc and
sulfur) precursors but at lower temperature.31 The nanocrystal core size was controlled by adjusting the precursor
concentrations and temperature; overall, the same thickness of the
overcoating ZnS layer was maintained for all samples.

The hydrophobic
QDs were phase-transferred to buffer media by photoligation with a
mixture of LA–PEG–OCH3 and LA–PEG–NH2 ligands. We describe the preparation of green-emitting QDs
photoligated with 5% LA–PEG–NH2 (5%-QDs).33 Hydrophobic QDs (150–200 μL, from
a stock QD dispersion, 15–20 μM) were precipitated using
ethanol. The dispersion was centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm. The
supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 750 μL
of hexane. Separately, 4.2 mg of LA–PEG–NH2, 95 mg of LA–PEG–OCH3, and ∼1 mg
of tetramethylammonium hydroxide were dissolved in 500 μL of
methanol and added to the QD dispersion. This QD-plus-ligand mixture
(two phase) was placed in a UV photoreactor (Model LZC-4 V, Luzchem
Research Inc., Ottawa, Canada) and irradiated for 40 min (at 350 nm,
4.5 mW/cm2) while stirring. The methanol layer containing
the QDs was separated and slightly dried under vacuum. A mixture of
methanol, chloroform, and hexane was added to the QDs at a volume
ratio of 1:1:10 and then centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm. The precipitated
QDs were gently dried under vacuum and redispersed in 1 mL of H2O. The dispersion in water was passed through a 0.45 μm
syringe filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and further purified by
applying three rounds of concentration/dilution using a centrifugal
membrane filtration device (MW cutoff 50 kDa, Millipore, Billerica,
MA). The same protocol with a few adjustments in the amounts of ligands
used was applied to prepare green-emitting QDs with 10% LA–PEG–NH2 (10%-QDs) as well as yellow- and red-emitting QDs with 5%
LA–PEG–NH2.34 The
final concentrations of the QD dispersions were determined by combining
the absorbance values and the molar extinction coefficients at 350
nm, ε350. Values of 8.1 × 105, 10.7
× 105, and 1.96 × 106 M−1/cm−1 were used for the extinction coefficients
of the green-, yellow-, and red-emitting QDs.38,44,45

Preparation of QD–SVS-1 Peptide Conjugates
The
surface-tethered amines on the QDs were coupled to the N-terminal
cysteine residue on the peptide via NHS ester maleimide coupling chemistry.46 Here, we limit our description to the conjugation
of green-emitting 5%-QDs to SVS-1 peptide. A similar protocol was
applied to prepare yellow- and red-emitting QD–SVS-1 conjugates.
Briefly, 0.24 mg of SVS-1 peptide was dissolved in 150 μL of
tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.3) and mixed with 7.5 μL of
6.98 mM solution of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) (the molar
ratio with respect to peptide was ∼0.5), and then the mixture
was left stirring at room temperature for 15 min. In a separate glass
vial, 100 μL of 5%-QDs (10.7 μM) was dispersed in 200
μL of phosphate buffer (pH 7.5, 20 mM), and then 25 μL
of 40 mM NHS ester maleimide solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
was added; this corresponds to ∼1000 times molar excess maleimide
with respect to QDs. The reaction mixture was stirred for ∼30
min, then one round of dilution/concentration with TBS buffer (pH
7.3) using a membrane filtration device (MW cutoff = 50 kDa) was applied
to remove excess NHS ester maleimide. The purified maleimide-modified
QD dispersion was added to the peptide–TCEP mixture followed
by addition of TBS (pH 7.3) to adjust the final volume to 300 μL.
The mixture was incubated for another ∼3 h while stirring.
The QD–SVS-1 conjugates were purified from unbound peptide
via the size-exclusion chromatography using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare,
Piscataway, NJ), then stored at 4 °C until further use. We anticipate
that this protocol would yield an average of ∼10 peptides per
QD-conjugate.

Cell Culture and Fluorescence Imaging Experiments
Four
cell lines were used in this study. Human cervical carcinoma (HeLa)
cells were acquired from the cell culture facility at Florida State
University; Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were kindly provided
by Strouse Laboratory at FSU; human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVEC)
and adenocarcinoma human alveolar basal epithelial (A549) cells were
provided by the NCI-60 repository (Frederick, MD). The cell cultures
were grown at 37 °C under humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere
in complete growth medium (Dulbecco’s modification of Eagle
medium, DMEM). The growth medium was supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal
bovine serum, l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, 1% (v/v) antibiotic–antimycotic
100×, and 1% (v/v) nonessential amino acid solution 100×.
For incubation experiments, 7 × 104 cells were seeded
onto microcover glasses in a 24-well microplate (CELLSTAR, VWR); cell
attachment was achieved by further incubating the culture overnight.
For the uptake studies, the cultures were mixed with nanocrystal–SVS-1
conjugates, or dispersions of the nanocrystals alone, along with Texas-Red-labeled
transferrin (when necessary). The various reagents were prepared in
serum-free DMEM media at the desired concentrations. After incubation,
the cells were washed three times with TBS buffer, fixed with 3.7%
paraformaldehyde, and then stained with DAPI to allow visualization
of the nuclei.

Experiments testing inhibition of endocytosis
were carried out using cells that had been cultured overnight. Three
sets of inhibition experiments were carried out. (1) The cell cultures
were first preincubated at 4 °C for 40 min, prior to mixing with
the conjugates.47 (2) The ATP depletion
experiments were carried out by first incubating the cells in glucose
and serum-free media containing 10 mM sodium azide and 50 mM 2-deoxy-d-glucose for 30 min, prior to mixing with the QD-conjugates.48 (3) The cells were preincubated for 1 h in serum-free
media containing 0.45 M sucrose; these conditions are expected to
selectively prevent the process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.49 In all three cases, the cell cultures were washed
with serum-free media followed by incubation with the QD–peptide
conjugates at the required concentration for 40 min. The cultures
were then washed, fixed, and mixed with DAPI for nuclei staining,
as described above.

The fluorescence images of the various labeled
and fixed cell cultures
were acquired using an Inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope equipped
with a color CoolSNAP HQ2 CCD camera. Excitation of the samples was
carried out using a Xe lamp, whereas the fluorescence images were
collected using a 60× objective combined with a set of filter
cubes acquired from Chroma Technology (Rockingham, VT). These include
a DAPI cube (with 340–380 nm excitation and 435–485
nm emission) to visualize the nuclei, a green fluorescent protein/enhanced
green fluorescent protein cube (with 450–490 nm excitation
and 500–550 nm emission) to detect the green signal from the
QDs; finally, visualization of either the red-emitting QDs or the
Texas-Red-transferrin staining was achieved using a Texas-Red HYQ
cube (with 532–587 nm excitation and 608–683 nm emission).

The cell cultures used for the live cell imaging studies were prepared
as follows. HeLa cells (2 × 104) per well were seeded
in eight-well chambered glass slides and incubated overnight to allow
adherence under normal culture conditions. The cells were then washed
and incubated with 2 μg/mL Hoechst 33342 dye for 20 min, then
mounted onto an EVOS FL Auto fluorescent microscope equipped with
an environmental chamber to maintain 37 °C and 5% CO2 during experiments (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). A concentrated
solution of QD–SVS-1 conjugates was added to the cells to reach
a final concentration of 50 nM, and the cells were immediately imaged
using a 20× objective. Illumination of the culture was provided
by a set of manufacturer LED light cubes for DAPI (357/44 nm excitation,
447/60 nm emission) and Texas-Red (585/29 nm excitation, 628/32 nm
emission). Images were collected every 2.5 min over a total period
of 30 min to monitor intracellular internalization of the conjugates.

Flow Cytometry Measurements
The cell cultures used
for performing the flow cytometry experiments were prepared by seeding
1.6 × 105 HeLa cells/well in a 24-well plate and allowing
the cells to adhere overnight under normal culture conditions. Flow
cytometry experiments applied to the QDs tested the effects of concentration,
conjugate valence, QD size, and selectivity. The cells were washed
with TBS, then 0.5 mL serum-free media containing unconjugated QDs
or QD–SVS-1 conjugates (diluted to required concentrations)
was added, followed by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. After treatment,
the cells were washed with TBS and incubated with 150 μL of
0.25% trypsin–ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution for
15 min. This procedure allows to both collect the cells for analysis
and digest any QD-conjugates that were not internalized but nonspecifically
adsorbed onto the cell membranes.49 The
cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min and then
resuspended in 1 mL of fresh TBS. The samples were analyzed using
a BD FACSCanto RUO Special Order System flow cytometer using 488 and
561 nm laser lines for excitation of the green- and yellow/red-emitting
QDs, respectively. Gating was based on normalized fluorescence of
untreated cells to evaluate the fraction of cells that have internalized
the QD–SVS-1 conjugates. Uptake studies were performed in three
independent experiments using three replicates for each experimental
condition.

To determine the role of endocytosis on QD–SVS-1
conjugate internalization, incubation of the cells was tested under
endocytosis inhibition conditions. Three conditions were explored.
Cell cultures were incubated at 4 °C or in the presence of two
chemical inhibitors (sodium azide or sucrose), as described above.
The cells were washed with serum-free media followed by incubation
with media containing green-emitting QD–SVS-1 conjugates at
50 nM for 40 min. The cultures were then prepared for flow cytometry
analysis, as described above. Measurements were carried out using
the Beckman Coulter FACSCalibur flow cytometer equipped with 488 nm
laser source for fluorescence excitation.

Cell Viability Assay
The viability test was limited
to HeLa cells. The cell cultures were incubated with either unconjugated
green QDs or green 5%-QD–SVS-1 conjugates, and their viability
was assessed using MTT assay. Briefly, HeLa cells were seeded onto
96-well microplates (3 × 104 cells/200 μL/well)
in triplicates and allowed to adhere overnight. The media were replaced
with 150 μL of media containing dispersions of either QDs alone
or QD–SVS-1 conjugates at concentrations ranging from 2.5 to
80 nM. A negative control was also prepared by incubating cells with
media containing 20% DMSO. After 24 h incubation, the cells were washed
with PBS three times and then 100 μL of freshly prepared MTT
solution in serum-free media (0.5 mg/mL) was added to each well. The
cultures were further incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The MTT solution
in each well was replaced with 150 μL of DMSO, and incubated
for 30 min until the MTT–formazan product was completely solubilized.
The absorbance was measured at 560 nm using a microplate reader (Infinite
M1000 PRO from TECAN). The viability was calculated and expressed
as a percentage with respect to the absorbance of the control culture
(i.e., cells not treated with QDs or QD–SVS-1).
