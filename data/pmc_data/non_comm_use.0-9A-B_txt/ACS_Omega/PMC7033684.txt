The
potential of erythritol as a platform chemical in biomass refinery
is discussed in terms of erythritol production and utilization. Regarding
erythritol production, fermentation of sugar or starch has been already
commercialized. The shift of the carbon source from glucose to inexpensive
inedible waste glycerol is being investigated, which will decrease
the price of erythritol. The carbon-based yield of erythritol from
glycerol is comparable to or even higher than that from glucose. The
metabolic pathway of erythritol biosynthesis has become clarified:
erythrose-4-phosphate, which is one of the intermediates in the pentose
phosphate pathway, is dephosphorylated and reduced to erythritol.
The information about the metabolic pathway may give insights to improve
the productivity by bleeding. Regarding erythritol utilization, chemical
conversions of erythritol, especially deoxygenation, have been investigated
in these days. Erythritol is easily dehydrated to 1,4-anhydroerythritol,
which can be also used as the substrate for production of useful C4
chemicals. C–O hydrogenolysis and deoxydehydration using heterogeneous
catalysts are effective reactions for erythritol/1,4-anhydroerythritol
conversion.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The use of biomass as a source of chemicals has been very important
because of global warming and depletion of crude oil. Biomass such
as lignocellulose is a complex mixture of polymers with various minor
components, and thus the main approach of the biomass conversion is
the utilization of “platform chemicals” as intermediates.1 The platform chemicals are small molecules which
can be synthesized in pure form from biomass via chemical conversion
or fermentation, and they included sugar alcohols, furanic compounds,
and carboxylic acids. The platform chemicals correspond to building
blocks in petrorefinery such as alkenes and BTX, and the approach
of biomass conversion using platform chemicals as intermediates is
called biomass refinery (or biorefinery). Both production of platform
chemicals and conversion to each target product have been intensively
investigated.

C4 compounds are an important class of chemicals
consumed in large
scale. Butadiene is a monomer for rubber and ABS resin. 1,4-Butanediol
(1,4-BuD) and THF are also used as a monomer. Other C4 oxygenates
such as butanones, butanols, and other butanediols are common chemicals
used in many fields. The main source of such C4 compounds in petrochemistry
is butadiene, butenes, and maleic anhydride. Butadiene and butenes
are coproducts of naphtha cracking whose main targets are ethylene
and propylene. However, recently lighter hydrocarbons such as associated
petroleum gas and shale gas than naphtha have become inexpensive substrates
of cracking or dehydrogenation for ethylene production.2 From these lighter hydrocarbons, the yield of
C4 compounds is much lower. In addition to global warming as a long-term
issue, the shift of carbon source in petrochemistry may increase the
competitiveness of C4 biomass refinery.

The widely recognized
C4 platform chemicals in biomass refinery
are fermentation-derived dicarboxylic acids, especially the most simple
form, succinic acid.1 Hydrogenation of
succinic acid to γ-butyrolactone or 1,4-BuD has been a hot topic
in biomass refinery.3 Other dicarboxylic
acids, namely, fumaric acid, malic acid, and aspartic acid, and some
other C4 compounds (acetoin, 3-hydroxybutyrolactone, and threonine)
are also listed in the screening report by the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory (NREL), U.S. Department of Energy;1 however, they can be mainly used for fine chemical production,
and the conversion to commodity chemicals has not been focused on.
In comparison with the C3, C5, and C6 biomass refinery where there
are versatile platform chemicals such as glycerol (C3), furfural (C5),
levulinic acid (C5), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (C6), and sorbitol (C6),
the C4 biomass refinery has limited product scope and has been less
investigated. Rather, production of C4 compounds from non-C4 platform
chemicals can also be practical, such as butadiene production from
ethanol and decarbonylation of furfural to furan.4

Erythritol (meso-1,2,3,4-butanetetraol)
is a C4
sugar alcohol which is distributed widely in fruits, fermented foods,
and animals. Like other sugar alcohols, erythritol is stable and durable
to decay with heat treatment. Erythritol has a moderate and plain
sweetness of 70–80% of sucrose. In addition, erythritol has
extremely low energy value as food, 0.2–0.4 kcal/g, because
the majority of erythritol (ca. 90%) is not metabolized in the human
body and is excreted into urine within 48 h after oral intake without
affecting blood glucose and insulin levels. Based on these characteristics,
erythritol has been used as an excellent additive (sweetener) to food,
cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. The current world production of erythritol
is about 60 000 t/year,5 and the
price is comparable to other compounds produced by fermentation such
as glutamic acid and citric acid. However, erythritol has been less
recognized as a “platform chemical”; the report by U.S.
Department of Energy did not mention erythritol at all even as one
of 47 potential building block candidates, while C3, C5, and C6 sugar
alcohols (glycerol, xylitol, and sorbitol) and glutamic acid were
regarded as “Top 12” building blocks; the revised list
in 2010 also included glycerol, xylitol, and sorbitol but not erythritol.1 Nevertheless, the utilization of erythritol as
a platform chemical began to be carried out, by our groups and some
other groups. In this paper, we introduce the potential of erythritol
as a platform chemical in biomass refinery by discussing the science
and technologies of erythritol production (section 2) and various conversion routes from erythritol
to useful chemicals (section 3).

2 Production of Erythritol
2.1 Fermentative
Production Using Glucose
Fermentative production of erythritol
has over 50 years of history.6 Hajny et
al. reported in 1964 that Tolura yeast produced a
substantial amount of erythritol in liquid media
when glucose was supplied as a carbon source.6a Then, Ohnishi described that yeast genera produce several kinds
of sugar alcohols: mannitol, arabitol, and erythritol.6b Currently, a wide variety of yeasts and yeast-like
fungi such as Moniliella, Torula, Candida, Pichia, Trichoderma, and Yarrowia are found to produce erythritol.

In 1988, Kasumi et al. isolated a yeast-like fungus that produced
a large amount of erythritol and originally designated Aureobasidium sp. SN-124A.6c This strain was then identified
as Trichosporonoides megachiliensis, and together
with reclassification of yeast, it was incorporated in a group of
genera Moniliella as M. megachiliensis SN-124A. M. megachiliensis SN-G42, the mutant strain
of SN-124A, showed excellent productivity of erythritol under stressing
high glucose concentration with a small amount of nitrogen source.6d Using this strain, industrial production of
erythritol was initially established in Japan in 1990. Currently,
microorganisms used for the commercial base of erythritol production
are Moniliella pollinis, Moniliella megachiliensis, and Yarrowia lypolitica. In contrast to ethanol,
erythritol hardly suppresses the growth of yeasts, and a high concentration
of erythritol (>200 g/L) can be obtained in a batch fermenter.7 The concentration of erythritol after fermentation
is higher than that of succinic acid (ca. 150 g/L).8 Essentially, erythritol is one of the compatible solutes
responding to environmental hyperosmotic or oxidative stress for erythritol-producing
yeasts. Hence, reasonably stressing culture conditions are necessary
to enhance erythritol yield. Erythritol has good crystallinity and
can be obtained in pure crystals (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Erythritol (recrystallized from aqueous solution).

2.2 Glycerol to Erythritol
Fermentation
uses edible sugars as the carbon source. Large-scale fermentation
may affect the food price, which has been actually pointed out for
the ethanol production for biogasoline. The use of cheap and inedible
biomass as a carbon source is preferable in biomass refinery.

Glycerol is generated as a waste material from biodiesel fuel manufacturing
which has been already carried out in large scale. Raw glycerol from
biodiesel fuel manufacturing is normally strongly alkaline and contains
various minor impurities. The purification of glycerol is energy consuming
and significantly increases the price. The majority of raw glycerol
is discarded at present. While chemical conversions of purified glycerol
into other valuable chemicals have been massively investigated, significant
interest is raised in converting waste glycerol.9

Fermentative production of erythritol using glycerol
as a carbon
source has recently been studied.10 Tomaszewska
et al. reported that an improved mutant strain of Y. lypolitica was able to convert purified glycerol to erythritol in good yield.10a Kasumi et al. found that M. megachiliensis SN-G42 can assimilate nonrefined glycerol derived from palm oil
and can convert it efficiently to erythritol.10b In case of beef tallow glycerol, the yield was significantly
low compared to palm oil, due to high pH value 11.0; however, it was
recovered after pH adjustment to neutral using diluted sulfuric acid.
Cell growth on glycerol was almost the same as on glucose, and the
cells could grow in up to 300 g/L of glycerol. When 200 g/L of nonrefined
glycerol was supplied, the carbon-based yield of erythritol was approximately
60% in a 500 mL flask batch culture after 3 days, which is slightly
higher than that obtained with glucose. Regarding wild-type M. megachiliensis SN-124A, cell growth and erythritol yield
were deficient compared to SN-G42, and in addition, the color of the
culture broth changed from dark brown to an initial yellowish brown
along with culture time because of the melaninoid pigment formation.
Further improvement in cell growth and erythritol might be possible.

2.3 Metabolic Pathway of Erythritol Biosynthesis
The metabolic pathway and related important enzymes of erythritol
biosynthesis are illustrated in Figure 2. In eukaryotes, erythritol is synthesized via the
pentose phosphate pathway, which also works in various biosyntheses
such as those of pentose derivatives (e.g., nucleotide). In the case
of erythritol-producing yeasts, erythrose-4-phosphate, which is one
of the intermediates in the pentose phosphate pathway, is specifically
dephosphorylated to erythrose. Then, erythrose is enzymatically reduced
to erythritol by NADP+-dependent erythrose reductase (ER).6d Among three sER isogenes (er1, er2, er3) of M. megachiliensis, er3 was highly responsive to hyper-osmotic stress
than er1 and er2. The two STREs
(stress response elements: AGGGG or CCCCT) which existed upstream
of er3 were considered closely related to stress
response and erythritol production.11 The
dephosphorylation step of erythrose-4-phosphate with erythrose-4-phosphate
phosphatase (or erythrose-4-phosphate kinase) should also be important;
however, the details have not yet been clarified for the erythritol-producing
yeasts. Since the pentose phosphate pathway is closely linked with
a glycolytic pathway, a lot of enzymes involved in both pathways take
part in erythritol biosynthesis. Especially, transketolase (TKL) or
transaldolase (TAL) that plays an important role in the pentose phosphate
pathway is also considered to be key enzymes.12 Similarly, two isogenes were present in TKL (tkl1, tkl2). The tkl1 expression increased
rapidly under osmotic stress, while tkl2 showed no
significant increase. In contrast, oxidative stress induced a considerable
increase in tkl2, while tkl1 expression
remained low.13 These profiles are related
to the existence of STRE in isogenes: two STREs in tkl1 and no STRE in tkl2. Meanwhile, two AP-1 elements
(activator protein 1 response element, TGACTCA or TGAGTCA) were found
in tkl2, but none were detected in tkl1. The AP-1 element is suggested as a binding site involved in oxidative
stress. The amount of erythritol produced was parallel to expression
profiles of these isogenes. Thus, erythritol was considered to be
generated in cooperation with isogenes of metabolic enzymes under
osmotic or oxidative stress in M. megachiliensis.

Figure 2 Metabolic
pathway of erythritol biosynthesis. “···-P”
means phosphate of sugars.

MAPK Hog1 (mitogen activated protein kinase Hog1) plays an important
role in signal response regulation during osmotic stress as well as
heat shock, oxidative stress, or cell mitosis.14 Hog1 phosphorylated by MAPKK rapidly translocates to the
nucleus and then stimulates transcription of target genes involved
in osmotic adaptation together with other transcription factors. Compared
with Hog1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, response
to osmotic stress of Megachiliensis Hog1 was highly
sensitive. Moreover, retention time in the nucleus was significantly
longer. The identity of an amino acid sequence between two strains
was as high as 79%. Hence, it is probably due to the distinct substitution
in dozens of amino acid sequences in the C-terminal region.

In the case of using glycerol as the carbon source,15 glycerol is reportedly metabolized through dihydroxyacetone
phosphate, which is formed by the oxidation of glycerol and successive
phosphorylation. Glycerol is also consumed through glycerol-3-phosphate
formed via phosphorylation by glycerol kinase. Glycerol-3-phosphate
is transformed to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and then dihydroxyacetone
phosphate by glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and triose phosphate
isomerase, respectively. These two triose isomers are then aldolizated
to fructose-6-phosphate via a gluconeogenetic enzyme. Erythritol is
possibly produced via two paths: oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate
as the starting material in the pentose phosphate pathway or by transaldolization
between glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate which
is the reverse reaction of the consumption step of erythrose-4-phosphate
in the pentose phosphate pathway. Besides erythritol, M. megachiliensis intracellularly accumulates a substantial amount of trehalose, which
is produced from glucose-6-phosphate, when cultured in a glycerol
medium. It is suggested that M. megachiliensis possesses
a metabolic pathway from glycerol to glucose-6-phosphate, similar
to the gluconeogenetic metabolism in S. cerevisiae.

Although the majority of metabolic mechanisms of erythritol
from
glycerol is still unclear, the proposed production routes in Figure 2 suggest that inherent
carbon loss during production of erythritol from glycerol is smaller
than that from glucose: The carbon loss occurs during the pentose
phosphate formation in the pentose phosphate pathway. From glucose,
two molecules of C6 glucose are first converted to two C5 pentose
phosphates and two CO2 (C1). The two pentose phosphates
are finally converted to one C4 erythritol and one C6 hexose phosphate.
The C6 hexose phosphate can also be used as the source of pentose
phosphate. The net reaction can be C6 → C4 + 2C1, and the theoretical
carbon-based erythritol yield from glucose is 67%. On the other hand,
from glycerol, one C3 phosphate and one C6 phosphate (derived from
two C3) are converted to one erythritol and one C5 xylulose-5-phosphate.
The C5 xylulose-5-phosphate reacts with C5 ribose-5-phosphate which
is produced by the pentose phosphate pathway (C6 → C5 + C1)
to give finally erythritol and C6 hexose phosphate. The coproduced
C6 hexose phosphate can be used in other steps. The net reaction can
be 3C3 → 2C4 + C1, and the theoretical carbon-based erythritol
yield from glycerol is 89%. Further comprehensive study is anticipated
to elevate erythritol production yield.

3 Conversion
of Erythritol to Valuable Chemicals
Erythritol has as much
as 52 wt % oxygen content, and therefore
the decrease of oxygen atoms is essential in the conversion to valuable
chemicals. There are two general methods to decrease oxygen atoms
in compounds: dehydration and deoxygenation.

3.1 Dehydration
of Erythritol to 1,4-Anhydroerythritol
(1,4-AHERY)
A dehydration product of erythritol is 1,4-anhydroerythritol
(cis-3,4-dihydroxytetrahydrofuran; 1,4-AHERY) (eq 1). Strong Brønsted
acid catalyzes this dehydration, such as mineral acids and ion-exchange
resin.16 Because of the much different
boiling points between erythritol and 1,4-AHERY, the reactive distillation
system is effective in collecting 1,4-AHERY product. The yield reaches
90% or even higher. The distillation may also be effective to remove
nonvolatile impurities of erythritol such as salt used in the salting-out
process for the collection of erythritol. The yield of 70–75%
was obtained in a simple batch reactor without a reactive distillation
system.16a Because of the relatively easy
synthesis of 1,4-AHERY, it can also be used as a reactant for the
production of useful C4 chemicals. 1  

3.2 Step-by-Step
Hydrodeoxygenation of Erythritol
and 1,4-AHERY
Deoxygenation of erythritol involves dissociation
of C–O bonds, and the C–O bonds are replaced with C–H
bonds. This is a reduction reaction requiring some reducing agents.
Molecular hydrogen (H2) is the best reducing agent in view
of price, atom efficiency, and availability from renewable resources.
Deoxygenation using molecular hydrogen as a reducing agent is called
hydrodeoxygenation. There is a similar term to hydrodeoxygenation:
C–O hydrogenolysis. C–O hydrogenolysis means the dissociation
of a C–O bond and capping with H atoms from the H2 molecule (R–OR′ + H2 → RH + R′OH).
C–O hydrogenolysis of alcohols (R′ = H) is hydrodeoxygenation,
while that of ethers is not because it does not decrease the oxygen
amount in organic molecules.

Hydrodeoxygenation products of
erythritol and 1,4-AHERY are summarized in Figure 3. Potential products include two butanetriols,
four butanediols (BuDs), and two butanols. Among these compounds,
BuDs are attractive targets because of the larger demand than triols
and a smaller amount of H2 to produce than butanols. However,
selective production of one specific BuD is difficult because of a
large number of isomers and the presence of overreaction to butanols.

Tomishige et al. applied an Ir-ReOx/SiO2 catalyst to erythritol hydrodeoxygenation.17 This Ir-ReOx/SiO2 is a very active C–O hydrogenolysis catalyst, especially
in selective dissociation of C–O bonds neighboring the −CH2OH group; i.e., R-CHOHCH2OH can be converted into
R-CH2CH2OH.18 Based
on the selectivity, erythritol is expected to be converted to 1,4-BuD.
After optimization of reaction conditions, the maximum yield of 1,4-BuD
was 25% (74% conversion, 33% selectivity).17 Longer reaction time increased the selectivity to 1-butanol instead
(Figure 4). The low
selectivity was reasonable considering that even in simpler glycerol
hydrodeoxygenation the maximum 1,3-propanediol yield was below 40%
over the Ir-ReOx/SiO2 catalyst
because of the overreaction to 1-propanol (initial selectivity was
∼70%).18a Pinel and Besson et al.
reported erythritol hydrodeoxygenation over Rh-ReOx catalysts,19 which are also active
in C–O dissociation (C–O hydrogenolysis) but less regioselective
than Ir-ReOx catalysts.18 A yield of BuDs (∼35%) similar to the case of Ir-ReOx/SiO2 catalyst (34%) was obtained,
while the distribution of isomers was different (mixture of 1,4-,
2,3-, and 1,2-BuDs over Rh-ReOx/ZrO2 catalyst; mainly 1,4-BuD with a small amount of 1,3-BuD over
the Ir-ReOx/SiO2 catalyst).
In contrast to the Ir-ReOx/SiO2 catalyst which showed a typical step-by-step consecutive reaction
profile, the selectivity to BuDs was little changed over the Rh-ReOx/ZrO2 catalyst during the conversion
range of 20–80%. BuDs were probably formed before desorption
of the formed butanetriols from the catalyst surface.

In contrast to erythritol
which contains 4 OH groups, 1,4-AHERY
has two sets of much different types of C–O bonds: two ether
bonds in the THF ring and two secondary OH groups. Therefore, selectivity
control is easier in 1,4-AHERY conversion than in erythritol conversion.20 Tomishige et al. reported 1,4-AHERY hydrodeoxygenation
over the Rh-MoOx/SiO2 catalyst.20a 2-Butanol was obtained in good yield (51%)
at the optimized conditions. Other M-MoOx/SiO2 (M = Pt, Pd, Ir) catalysts, other Rh-M′Ox/SiO2 (M′ = W, Re, Nb,
Cr, Mn) catalysts, and Ir-ReOx/SiO2 catalysts showed lower selectivity to 2-butanol or no activity.
The time course of 1,4-AHERY hydrodeoxygenation over Rh-MoOx/SiO2 is shown in Figure 5. The main products at short reaction time
are 1,2,3-butanetriol (35% selectivity), 2-butanol (21%), and butanediols
(26%). There are reaction routes with multiple C–O hydrogenolysis
without desorption of intermediate polyols. The selective removal
of the C–OH bond in 1,4-AHERY has also been investigated by
the same group.20b With WOx-Pd/ZrO2 catalyst, 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran
was obtained with 74% yield from 1,4-AHERY (eq 2). The WOx-Pd
catalyst only converts vicinal OH groups (−CHOH–CHOH−)
to monoalcohols (−CH2–CHOH−) and has
no activity in C–O hydrogenolysis of monoalcohols. The reaction
mechanism of WOx-Pd-catalyzed C–O
hydrogenolysis was thought to be a variant of deoxydehydration, which
will be described in the next subsection. While 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran
has limited applications, it can be converted to 1,3-BuD with selective
C–O hydrogenolysis over Ir-ReOx/SiO2 catalyst (eq 3).18c 2

As shown above, Rh and Ir catalysts
modified with reducible metal
oxides (MoOx, ReOx) are active in hydrodeoxygenation. Typically, under the reaction
conditions, the metal oxide species are partially reduced, and a direct
bond with a noble metal (Rh or Ir) surface is formed.18 The attached metal oxide species activates the substrate
molecule and/or affects the electronic state of the noble metal surface
to increase the activity. The noble metal activates the H2 molecule. Typically first-order dependence with respect to H2 pressure was observed, and probably hydride-like active species
were formed with 1:1 stoichiometry from H2 on the catalyst
surface.

3.3 Deoxydehydration (DODH)
The C–O
hydrogenolysis reactions introduced above dissociate C–O bonds
step by step, and the regioselectivity is generally not high. Recently,
another deoxygenation reaction, deoxydehydration (DODH), has attracted
attention for the conversion of biomass-derived polyols.21 DODH is the reverse reaction of cis-dihydroxylation of alkenes (i.e., osmium oxidation): cis-vicinal diols are converted to alkenes with 2-electron-reducing
agents (Scheme 1).
Typical DODH catalysts are homogeneous Re species such as methyltrioxorhenium
(MTO; CH3ReO3) and Cp*ReO3. The reaction
is believed to proceed via redox of Re species between +5 and +7 valence
states.

Scheme 1 Deoxydehydration (DODH) Catalyzed by Re Species
Erythritol and 1,4-AHERY have been frequently used as
reactants
for DODH. Even the first report of DODH in 1996 used erythritol as
one of tested reactants, giving ca. 80% yield of butadiene with Cp*ReO3 catalyst, PPh3 reducing agent, and chlorobenzene
solvent.21b Shiramizu and Toste reported
a more practical system using CH3ReO3 catalyst
and 3-octanol as both a solvent and a reducing agent. Erythritol and
1,4-AHERY were converted to butadiene and 2,5-dihydrofuran with 89%
and 91% yield, respectively (Scheme 2).21c Gebbink et al. developed
CpttReO3 catalyst (Cptt = 1,3-di-tert-butylcyclopentadienyl) and obtained 90% butadiene yield
from erythritol using 3-octanol.21d Bergman
et al. reported direct conversion of erythritol to 2,5-dihydrofuran
via acid-catalyzed cyclization and DODH with 62% yield using TsOH,
Re2(CO)10, and 3-octanol as an acid catalyst,
a DODH catalyst, and a reducing agent, respectively.21e The problems of these typical DODH systems include difficult
recovery of used catalyst (homogeneous system), low turnover number
(<50), the use of non-H2 reducing agent, and the price
of Re catalyst. The development of cheaper catalysts such as Mo than
Re has been a hot topic in DODH studies; however, both activity (higher
reaction temperature by >50 K) and product yield (≤75% 2,5-dihydrofuran
from 1,4-AHERY; very low butadiene yield (≤3%) from erythritol)
were lower than those in the case of Re catalysts.21f,21g,21h The use of H2 as
a reducing agent is generally difficult in DODH probably because of
the overreduction of the active Re (or Mo) species to inactive low
valent species.

Scheme 2 DODH of Erythritol and 1,4-AHERY with CH3ReO3 Catalyst21c
Tomishige et al. developed a ReOx/CeO2-based new heterogeneous DODH catalyst,
overcoming these problems.
First, the ReOx-Pd/CeO2 catalyst
was developed, which is active in hydrodeoxygenation of cis-vicinal diols (−CHOH–CHOH– + 2H2 → −CH2–CH2– +
2H2O).22 This is a variant of
DODH because this reaction is composed of DODH and Pd-catalyzed hydrogenation
of the produced alkene. 1,4-AHERY was efficiently converted to THF
with H2 as a reducing agent (Figure 6). This system showed very high THF yield
(>99%), good reusability (activity totally recovered after calcination),
and very large TON (>104). From erythritol, 1,2-butanediol
was obtained in good yield (77%) at an appropriate reaction time (eq 4), while too long reaction
time led to overreaction to butane.22a This
is the first and only report in the literature to obtain 1,2-butanediol
in good yield from erythritol. The activity trends of related catalysts
and various characterizations suggested that monomeric Re species
with a +4 or +6 valence state on the CeO2 crystal surface
was the active site for DODH.22b Higher
Re loading rather decreased the activity because the major Re species
was shifted from monomeric ones to inactive polymeric ones. The Pd
species activate H2 molecules to supply Re species with
hydrogen species to reduce the Re species. In addition, Pd catalyzes
hydrogenation of the C=C bond formed by DODH. The rate-determining
step is the formation of alkene and oxidized Re species, and the steps
of reduction of Re species and hydrogenation of the C=C bond
are fast, which has been shown by the small effect on activity by
both the Pd loading amount and H2 pressure. The main role
of CeO2 support is the stabilization of Re species with
higher valence state: on other supports such as SiO2 the
Re species are easily reduced to a lower valence state (0 ∼
+3). 4

Next, ReOx-Au/CeO2 was developed
which catalyzes DODH without hydrogenation.23 Au has much lower activity in hydrogenation of C=C bonds,
especially when the Au particle size is large. When the Au particle
size was adjusted to an appropriate level (∼10 nm), the ReOx-Au/CeO2 catalyst showed very
high selectivity to an alkene product from vicinal diols. The ReOx-Au/CeO2 catalyst is the only
DODH catalyst that can use H2 as a reducing agent with
good yield in the literature. Butadiene (81% yield) and 2,5-dihydrofuran
(80% yield) were obtained from erythritol and 1,4-AHERY, respectively
(Scheme 3).23a Although the activity of the ReOx-Au/CeO2 catalyst was lower than that
of ReOx-Pd/CeO2 because of
the very small number of H2 activation sites,23b the ReOx-Au/CeO2 catalyst showed similarly good stability. The good yield
of butadiene from erythritol is attractive because butadiene is a
very important monomer in industry. There are several other production
routes of butadiene from biomass, such as succinic acid hydrogenation
+ dehydration and ethanol dimerization. The production routes will
be compared economically. In view of consumed H2 amount,
the erythritol DODH (2 equiv of H2 consumed) is better
than succinic acid hydrogenation to 1,4-BuD + dehydration (4 equiv
of H2 consumed), while both erythritol and succinic acid
are compounds produced by fermentation.

Scheme 3 DODH of Erythritol
and 1,4-AHERY over Heterogeneous ReOx-Au/CeO2 Catalyst23a
A variant of ReOx-Au/CeO2-catalyzed DODH has been further developed. When ReOx-Au/CeO2 catalyst was mixed with ReOx/C catalyst, 1,4-AHERY was reduced to 1,4-BuD
in good yield (∼90%) (Scheme 4).24 The reactivities of
possible intermediates showed that the 1,4-BuD formation is composed
of several steps: DODH of 1,4-AHERY to 2,5-dihydrofuran, isomerization
of 2,5-dihydrofuran to 2,3-dihydrofuran, hydration of 2,3-dihydrofuran
to 2-hydroxytetrahydrofuran, hydrogenation of 2-hydroxytetrahydrofuran
or the ring-opened form (4-hydroxybutanal) to 1,4-BuD. The first DODH
step is catalyzed by ReOx-Au/CeO2. The isomerization step is catalyzed by ReOx on ReOx/C. The hydration step
of 2,3-dihydrofuran is catalyzed by a weak acid and proceeds over
the C support. The final hydrogenation step is catalyzed by ReOx on ReOx/C. 2-Hydroxytetrahydrofuran
or 4-hydroxybutanal reversibly reacted with 1,4-AHERY to form acetal,
which was actually detected at short reaction time. The key to obtain
1,4-BuD is the selection of the support of the second catalyst for
the isomerization step. The ReOx catalyst
on the carbon support was active in isomerization, while ReOx/oxide support catalysts showed low activity. The
type of carbon also affected the activity: carbon black BP2000 showed
good performance. Later, it was found that the Au promoter is not
necessary in the mixture catalysts.24b A
simple mixture of ReOx/CeO2 + ReOx/C showed almost the same activity
and selectivity in the reduction of 1,4-AHERY to 1,4-BuD. The catalyst
stability is an unsolved issue in this system: while ReOx(−Au)/CeO2 can be regenerated by
calcination, the mixture with ReOx/C cannot
be calcined because of the combustibility of carbon support. The production
route of 1,4-BuD from erythritol via 1,4-AHERY will also be compared
with that from succinic acid, as well as the case of butadiene production.

Tungsten (W) can form reducible oxide with high
valence, like Mo
and V. While Mo and V have been investigated as catalysts for DODH,
W has not been regarded as an active element for DODH. However, we
think that the catalysis of WOx-Pd/support
described in the above section is a variant of DODH, namely, DODH
+ hydration, because of the similar reactivity trends of various substrates
to those of DODH: only cis-vicinal diols were converted.20b The alkene intermediate was probably quickly
hydrated over the acidic W center before desorption, and the cis-vicinal diols were converted to monoalcohols.

Another variant of DODH is the reaction of diols with formic acid.16b At high temperature (around 500 K), cis-vicinal diols reacts with formic acid to give alkenes,
water, and CO2 (Scheme 5). An orthoester-type intermediate has been proposed,
and the thermal decomposition of this intermediate gives the products.
2,5-Dihydrofuran can be obtained in 87% isolated yield from 1,4-AHERY
with 2 equiv of formic acid at 483 K. From erythritol, a substantial
amount of erythritol was first dehydrated to 1,4-AHERY and then reacted
with formic acid. 2,5-Dihydrofuran was obtained in 39% isolated yield
from erythritol + formic acid (2 equiv). The strong acidity of formic
acid led to dehydration of erythritol. The use of formic acid orthoester
instead of formic acid itself can suppress the dehydration.25 With 2 equiv of triethyl orthoformate in DMSO
solvent at 588 K, butadiene was obtained at 42% yield. The absence
of expensive metal catalysts in a formic-acid-based system is attractive;
however, further improvement in the performance of this system is
difficult because this is a noncatalyzed system.

Acid
4 Summary
and Outlook
Erythritol has already been manufactured by fermentation
in a large
scale. While the current use of erythritol is sweetener, erythritol
can be regarded as a platform chemical in biomass refinery. The production
cost is a limiting factor to use erythritol as a source of chemicals
such as monomers for plastics. The production cost will be lowered
by the use of a cheaper carbon source such as waste glycerol and/or
further breeding of the microorganisms for erythritol production.
The biosynthesis mechanism of erythritol is being clarified, and the
insights will help the bleeding. Erythritol can be readily converted
to 1,4-anhydroerythritol (1,4-AHERY) by acid-catalyzed dehydration,
and 1,4-AHERY can also be regarded as a platform chemical. Because
of the large amount of oxygen in erythritol, reduction with hydrogen
(hydrodeoxygenation) is the main method to synthesize useful compounds
from erythritol or 1,4-AHERY. The main targets of erythritol conversion
have been butadiene, 1,4-butanediol, 2,5-dihydrofuran, and THF. Except
2,5-dihydrofuran which is not a commodity chemical, these compounds
can also be synthesized from succinic acid which has been already
recognized as a C4 platform chemical. The reaction routes from erythritol
and succinic acid will be compared. Different from succinic acid,
erythritol can serve as a source of other butanediols: 1,2-, 1,3-,
and 2,3-. However, the reports for the productions of these butanediols
from erythritol or 1,4-AHERY are very limited: only 1,2-butanediol
could be obtained in good yield from erythritol over ReOx-Pd/CeO2 catalyst. Catalysts for the reduction
of erythritol or 1,4-AHERY can be classified to two types: noble-metal-catalyzed
C–O hydrogenolysis and deoxydehydration (DODH). Noble-metal-catalyzed
C–O hydrogenolysis can give various types of products including
1,3-butanediol; however, the selectivity control is difficult. More
catalyst development is necessary in view of precise control of active
sites, in addition to selection of appropriate components (active
metal, additives, and support) of catalyst. DODH has simpler product
pattern and can give higher selectivity to one specific product. ReOx/CeO2-based catalysts are promising
DODH catalysts because of the heterogeneous nature, use of H2 as a reducing agent, and good stability.
