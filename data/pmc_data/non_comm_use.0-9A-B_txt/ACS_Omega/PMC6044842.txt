Multifunctional Fe3O4@resorcinol–formaldehyde
resin/Cu2O composite microstructures (denoted as Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O microstructures) were successfully
constructed via a simple wet chemical route that has not been reported
so far in the literature. The as-obtained Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O microstructures were characterized using field-emission
scanning electron microscopy, (high-resolution) transmission electron
microscopy, selected-area electron diffraction, X-ray diffraction,
and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy. The investigations showed
that the as-obtained microstructures presented not only excellent
antibacterial activity to Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive bacteria) and Escherichia coli (Gram-negative bacteria) but also highly efficient catalytic ability
for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) in a solution with excess
NaBH4. Owing to the presence of Fe3O4, the antibacterial reagent and the catalyst could be readily collected
from the mixed systems under the assistance of an external magnetic
field. It was found that the as-obtained microstructures displayed
good cycling stability in antibacterial and catalytic applications.
Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O microstructures still
retained more than 87% of the antibacterial efficiency after 5 cycles
and 89% of the catalytic efficiency after 10 cycles.

Introduction
Antibacterial agents have been widely
used in many fields including
water disinfection, textile industry, medicine, food packaging, and
so on.1−4 At present, organic antibacterial agents are the main commodity
on the market.5−8 However, organic antibacterial agents come with many shortcomings,
such as low heat resistance, volatility, environmental pollution,
poor security, and short-lived duration.9−11 To conquer the above
shortcomings, therefore, inorganic antibacterial agents with improved
properties were developed. Currently, several nanoscaled inorganic
matters, including TiO2, ZnO, Cu2O, and silver,
have shown a strong antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and/or
Gram-negative bacteria.12−17 Among them, Cu2O, a typical p-type semiconductor with
a direct band of 2.17 eV, shows a great promise for biomedical applications
because of its unique potential to combine the intrinsic antibacterial
effects with multiple other functionalities.18−24 For example, Lu et al. investigated the antibacterial activities
of Cu2O with different shapes and found that all Cu2O crystals with various shapes presented good bacteriostatic
activities.25 Even after Cu2O was coated with different surfactants, it still exhibited eminent
antifungal activity for yeast.26 Furthermore,
Cu2O also presents outstanding catalytic activity for the
photodegradation of organic pollutants and the synthesis of organic
compounds.27,28

Usually, it is necessary
to separate antibacterial agents or catalysts
from a heterogeneous system. On the one hand, the recovered antibacterial
agents or catalysts can be reused to enhance the efficiency and to
reduce the cost. On the other hand, recovering antibacterial agents
or catalysts can avoid secondary pollution.29,30 Although traditional separation strategies such as centrifugation,
free settling, and filtration have been widely adopted, they suffer
from loss of antibacterial agents and catalyst, complicated operating
equipment, and high operational costs.31,32 Therefore,
a benign, effective, and inexpensive separation method is extremely
desirable. Compared with the above separation methods, magnetic separation
shows superior separation effect and draws increasing attention because
of its low cost and ease of use. An antibacterial agent or catalyst
carried by magnetic substances has good magnetic response to the additional
magnetic field, which can achieve the goal of fast and efficient separation.33−35

Iron oxide nanoparticles, such as magnetite (Fe3O4), are very interesting materials for biomedical applications
because of their high biocompatibility, peculiar magnetic property,
low preparation cost, high thermal and mechanical stabilities, and
adaptability for large-scale production.36−39 In the current work, we attempted
to construct Cu2O nanoparticle-strewn Fe3O4@resorcinol–formaldehyde resin microstructures (denoted
as Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O microstructures)
through simple wet chemical routes. First, Fe3O4@RF microstructures were obtained by the polymerization of RF on
the surfaces of Fe3O4 microspheres. Then, the
Fe3O4@RF microstructures were modified with
the silane coupling agent KH550 (3-amino propyl triethoxy silane).
Finally, Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O microstructures
were prepared through the reduction of Cu2+ in the system
containing Fe3O4@RF. It was found that the saturation
magnetization (Ms) of Fe3O4 microspheres decreased
with the formation of Fe3O4@RF and Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O microstructures. Experiments showed
that the as-obtained Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O microstructures exhibited strong antibacterial ability to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) and highly efficient catalytic activity
for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) in excess NaBH4 solution. Compared with the existing microstructures, the microstructure
prepared in our study presented better catalytic activity. Furthermore,
due to the existence of magnetic Fe3O4 cores,
the present antibacterial reagent and the catalyst can be easily recycled
under the extra magnetic field, which can efficiently reduce the cost
in practical applications.

Results and Discussion
Morphology and Structure
Characterization
The morphologies
of pure Fe3O4, Fe3O4@RF,
and Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O microstructures
were characterized using field-emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technologies. Figure 1 depicts representative
FESEM images of three samples. Pure Fe3O4 prepared
by the solvothermal technology is composed of uniform microspheres
with an average diameter of ∼180 nm (see Figure 1a). These microspheres were made of an abundance
of small nanoparticles, which resulted in unsmooth surfaces of microspheres
(see the inset in 1a). After RF was formed
on monodisperse Fe3O4 microspheres, the product
still presented spherical microstructures, but the surfaces of microspheres
became smooth (see Figure 1b and its inset). Simultaneously, the sizes of microspheres
increased to ∼250 nm. Figure 1c shows an FESEM image of the final Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O. An abundance of nanoparticles of size
5–15 nm are distributed on the surfaces of spherical microstructures,
implying that Cu2O nanoparticles have been successfully
decorated on the Fe3O4@RF microspheres. Furthermore,
it is worth pointing out that RF and KH550 play crucial roles in the
formation of Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O. Without
either RF or KH550, Cu2O nanoparticles cannot be decorated
on the surfaces of Fe3O4 microspheres.

Figure 1 FESEM images
of Fe3O4 microspheres (a), Fe3O4@RF microspheres (b), and Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O microspheres (c).

TEM observations confirmed the results of SEM. As shown in Figure 2a, pure Fe3O4 microspheres are made of an abundance of small nanoparticles
∼15 nm in size, which results in the roughness of the microsphere
surfaces. After pure Fe3O4 microspheres have
been coated with RF, clear core–shell structures with smooth
surfaces can be easily observed (see Figure 2b). The typical TEM image of the final product
is exhibited in Figure 2c. An abundance of small nanoparticles with a mean size of ∼10
nm are strewn on the surfaces of Fe3O4@RF microspheres.
Selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shown in the inset
in 2c proves the good crystallinity of the
final product. Bright spots are ascribed to the face-centered cubic
(fcc) Fe3O4, and a weak spot near the (400)
plane of fcc Fe3O4 is attributed to the (111)
plane of cubic Cu2O. Figure 2d depicts a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) image of the final product. Several spherical nanoparticles
are distributed on the surface of the amorphous RF layer. The clear
matrix stripes imply good crystallinity of nanoparticles. The distance
between neighboring planes is measured to be ∼0.212 nm, which
is very close to 0.21335 nm of the distance between the neighboring
(200) planes of cubic Cu2O. The above facts confirm that
Cu2O nanoparticles have indeed been successfully decorated
on Fe3O4@RF microspheres.

Figure 2 TEM images of Fe3O4 (a), Fe3O4@RF (b), and
Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O (c) and (d) HRTEM image
of Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O. The inset in (c)
is the SAED pattern of Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O.

The formation of Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O
is also confirmed using XRD and EDS analyses of the final product. Figure 3a compares the XRD
patterns of the samples before and after strewing Cu2O
nanoparticles on the surfaces of Fe3O4@RF. Owing
to the amorphous nature of RF, only the diffraction peaks of fcc Fe3O4 are detected before loading Cu2O
nanoparticles [see the lower pattern in Figure 3a, the lower line pattern is the Joint Committee
on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) card no. 75-0449 of fcc Fe3O4. After strewing Cu2O nanoparticles,
the peaks belonging to Fe3O4 can be still found,
but an obvious new peak centered at 36.4° can be readily distinguished
(see the upper pattern in Figure 3a). By comparison with the data of the JCPDS card files
no. 78-2076, this new diffraction peak is indexed as the (111) plane
of cubic Cu2O. The other Cu2O peaks centered
at 42.3°, 61.3°, and 73.5° should overlap with the
ones of Fe3O4 at the corresponding situations.
Nevertheless, the above facts prove that the final product contains
Fe3O4 and Cu2O. Figure 3b shows the EDS result of the
final product. O, Fe, and Cu peaks are clearly visible. Simultaneously,
the strong C peak comes from organic compounds such as RF and KH550,
and the weak Si peak is attributed to the silane coupling agent. Markedly,
the EDS analysis further confirms the successful preparation of Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O. Moreover, according to the
calculation result of the EDS peak areas, ∼11.9 wt % of Cu2O is loaded on the surfaces of Fe3O4@RF microspheres.

energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O.

It was found that the coating of RF and the subsequent loading
of Cu2O nanoparticles could obviously change the magnetism
of Fe3O4 microspheres. Figure 4 shows the room-temperature hysteresis loops
of Fe3O4 microspheres, Fe3O4@RF, and Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O. Their corresponding
Ms values are, in turn, 48.5, 21.7, and 14.4 emu g–1. The Ms value of Fe3O4 decreases with the
integration of RF and Cu2O, in turn. Although the magnetism
of Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O markedly decreases
against pure Fe3O4, it can still be quickly
separated from a solution by an external magnetic field, which is
favorable for its collection and reuse.

Antibacterial Activity
Our previous work had proven
that Cu2O owned excellent antimicrobial activities.14 To investigate the antibacterial activity of
the as-obtained Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O, in
the present work, S. aureus (a Gram-positive
bacterium) and E. coli (a Gram-negative
bacterium) are selected as the representative bacteria. Inhibition
of the bacterial growth is monitored by the optical density (OD) of
the system. Figure 5 shows the growth curves of ∼107 cfu/mL of E. coli or S. aureus in liquid media with different concentrations of Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O microstructures. When no antibacterial
agent in the system, the bacteria rapidly breed and reach the maximum
peak after 16 h for E. coli or 14 h
for S. aureus. After the antibacterial
agent is introduced, the reproduction of the bacteria is restrained,
and the reproduction ability of the bacteria is negatively correlated
to the concentration of the antibacterial agent. When increasing the
concentration of the antibacterial agent to 64 μg mL–1, the reproduction of E. coli is almost
inhibited (see Figure 5a). Whereas the growth of S. aureus is completely inhibited, the concentration of the antibacterial
agent reaches 128 μg mL–1 (see Figure 5b). The above experiments indicate
that the as-prepared Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O microstructures possess excellent antibacterial properties against
both Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria and that the
antibacterial effect of the antibacterial agent against the Gram-negative
bacteria E. coli is better than that
against the Gram-positive bacteria S. aureus. To ascertain the role of Fe3O4@RF in the
antibacterial process, furthermore, we compared the changes in the
OD values of S. aureus and E. coli solutions in the presence of 256 μg
mL–1 Fe3O4@RF and Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O, respectively. As shown in Figure 5c, in the presence
of Fe3O4@RF, the OD values of S. aureus and E. coli solutions present trends similar to those of the control experiments,
implying that the propagation of bacteria cannot be restrained by
Fe3O4@RF. After Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O microstructures are added, however, the OD values of the
two bacterial solutions hardly change within 24 h, indicating that
the propagation of the bacteria is strongly restrained. The above
facts confirm that the antibacterial function of Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O still comes from Cu2O nanoparticles.

(b) S. aureus in the presence
of Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O microstructures
at various concentrations. (c) Changes in OD values of S. aureus (red lines) and E. coli (black lines) with the incubation duration in the presence of various
antibacterial agents at a concentration of 256 μg mL–1.

Figure 6a depicts
the correlations between the bacteriostatic effect and the concentration
of the antibacterial agent. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) against E. coli and S. aureus was 35.8 ± 3.7 and 49.5 ± 2.7
μg mL–1, respectively. Obviously, the present
antibacterial agent has a lower IC50 value against E. coli than against S. aureus, which is in good agreement with the result shown in Figure 5. Furthermore, owing to the
magnetic influence of the as-prepared Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O microstructures, the present antibacterial agent can be
easily separated from a system with the assistance of extra magnetic
fields. This provides the possibility of reusing the antibacterial
agent. Figure 6b exhibits
the inhibition efficiency of the antibacterial agent to E. coli under different cycling times. After five
cycles, the inhibition efficiency of the antibacterial agent still
remains at 87%. Obviously, this is important for practical applications
for cost savings.

Catalytic Ability for the Reduction of 4-NP
It was
also found that the as-obtained Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O microstructures also presented excellent catalytic activity
for the reduction of some small organic molecules such as 4-NP in
excess NaBH4 solution. Generally, 4-NP and NaBH4 can form an intermediate, which has an absorption peak at 400 nm,
and can stably exist for several days when no catalyst is added. After
a catalyst is introduced, 4-NP can be rapidly reduced by NaBH4 to produce 4-aminophenol (4-AP), which causes the absorption
peak at 400 nm to disappear and a new peak at ∼309 nm to appear. Figure 7a exhibits the ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) absorption spectra of the system that consisted of
4-NP, NaBH4, and 6 mg L–1 Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O after reacting for various durations.
With the increase in the reaction time, the intensity of the peak
at 400 nm markedly decreases, and a new absorption peak at ∼309
nm appears. After 4 min, the peak at 400 nm almost disappears, which
indicates that the as-obtained Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O microstructures possess an excellent catalytic ability for
the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP in excess NaBH4 solution.
To investigate the influence of the amount of catalyst on the reaction
rate, 2, 4, and 8 mg L–1 Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O were used as the catalyst. As shown in Figure 7b, the above reduction
reaction can be markedly promoted by the amount of catalyst. However,
when 8 mg L–1 catalyst was used, the catalytic curve
almost overlapped with that obtained in the presence of 6 mg L–1 catalyst, implying that the optimum catalyst concentration
was 6 mg L–1 in the current work. Figure 7c compares the curves of the
concentration change in 4-NP versus time in the presence of Fe3O4@RF and Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O. When 6 mg L–1 Fe3O4@RF was selected as the catalyst, the reduction reaction did not
take place. This fact indicates that the reduction reaction of 4-NP
to 4-AP is catalyzed only by Cu2O. The kinetic constant
of this pseudo-first-order reaction (k) is 0.75 min–1 (see the inset in 7c). Compared
with some previous reports, the present catalyst displays better catalytic
activity (see Table 1). Furthermore, the presence of magnetic Fe3O4 cores is favorable for the collection and reuse of the present catalyst.
As shown in Figure 7d, after 10 cycles, the catalytic activity of the present catalyst
still remains to be 89%. Obviously, this is important for practical
applications.

Characterization
The X-ray powder
diffraction patterns
of the products were recorded on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer
equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154060 nm), at a
scanning rate of 0.2° s–1 and 2θ ranging
from 10° to 80°. SEM images were obtained on Hitachi S-4800

absorption spectra were recorded using a Metash 6100 UV–vis
absorption spectrophotometer (Shanghai). The OD of bacteria was measured
using UV-2000 spectrophotometer.

Synthesis of Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O
Synthesis of Fe3O4@RF Microstructures
To obtain Fe3O4@RF microstructures, Fe3O4 microspheres
assembled with an abundance of
nanoparticles were prepared in advance using a solvothermal method
as previously reported.13c In a typical
experiment, 1.0 g of FeCl3·6H2O and 0.3
g of trisodium citrate dihydrate were first dissolved in 30 mL of
ethylene glycol under vigorous stirring. Then, 2.0 g of urea was added
into the above solution under stirring. After continuously stirring
for another 30 min, the as-obtained mixture was sealed in a Teflon-lined
stainless-steel autoclave of 40 mL capacity and heated at 200 °C
for 10 h. Subsequently, the system was naturally cooled to room temperature.
The black product was separated magnetically, washed with deionized
water and ethanol several times, and finally dried under vacuum at
60 °C for 24 h.

Fe3O4 (0.1 g) microspheres
prepared from the above process were placed into a 250 mL three-necked
flask with 30 mL of ethanol and 70 mL of pure water. Next, 0.1 g of
resorcinol and 0.5 mL of ammonia were added. After the as-obtained
mixed system was ultrasonically treated for 30 min, the system was
heated to 35 °C. Herein, 0.14 mL of 37 wt % formaldehyde solution
was poured into the above system under vigorous mechanical stirring.
After continuously stirring for 6 h, the precipitate was collected
using a magnet, washed with distilled water and ethanol several times,
and dried under vacuum at 60 °C overnight.

Synthesis
of Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O
Microstructures
To successfully prepare Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O microstructures, the surfaces of Fe3O4@RF microstructures must be modified by the silane
coupling agent KH550 in advance. Typically, 50 mg of the Fe3O4@RF microstructure was first placed into a 150 mL three-necked
flask with 50 mL of absolute ethanol. After the as-obtained system
was ultrasonically dispersed for 30 min, a mechanical stirring was
adopted. Under continuous stirring, 300 μL of KH550 was quickly
introduced. The as-obtained mixed system was stirred at room temperature
for 24 h. The precipitate was purified under the assistance of magnetic
separation, washed with ethanol several times, and dried under vacuum
at 60 °C for 24 h.

Subsequently, KH550-modified Fe3O4@RF microstructures were dispersed in 20 mL of
dimethylformamide (DMF) and dropped into a flask containing 20 mL
of DMF with 0.1 M maleic anhydride. The mixture was mechanically stirred
for 24 h at room temperature. The precipitate was collected using
a magnet, washed with DMF several times, and dried in vacuum at 60
°C for 24 h. Carboxylic-functional Fe3O4@RF microstructures (Fe3O4@RF–COOH)
were obtained. The modification process of Fe3O4 microspheres is illustrated in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Surface Modification Process of Fe3O4 Microspheres
Under the ultrasonication,
50 mg of the Fe3O4@RF–COOH sample was
dispersed into 40 mL of deionized water. After 30 min, 1 mL of 0.1
M CuCl2 solution was added. After continuous ultrasonication
for another 10 min, 10 mL of 1 M NaOH was poured. Subsequently, 1
mL of 0.2 M NH2OH·HCl solution was poured. The above
mixed system was left for 2 h to allow the formation of Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O magnetic microstructures. Finally,
the precipitate was collected using a magnet, washed with distilled
water and ethanol several times, and dried in vacuum at 60 °C
overnight.

Antibacterial Activity
For the antimicrobial
activity
test, we prepared the cultivation medium containing 0.2% (w/v) glucose,
0.4% (w/v) lactose, 0.05% (w/v) K2HPO4, 0.05%
(w/v) KH2PO4, 0.1% (w/v) NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) NH4Cl, 0.002 M MgSO4·7H2O, and 1.0
× 10–4 M CaCl2. The pH of the medium
was 7.4.

Measurements of Antibacterial Properties of Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O Microstructures
Gram-positive S. aureus and Gram-negative E. coli were selected as model organisms. The OD at 600 nm (OD600) of organisms
was measured to reflect the variation in the amount of organisms.
Before culturing bacteria, the culture medium was first sterilized
by autoclaving at 121 °C for 20 min. The two bacteria were separately
inoculated in liquid media at 37 °C for 24 h until an approximate
OD600 of 0.8 was reached (here, the colony-forming units were ∼2
× 108 cfu mL–1). After diluting
the above suspension to 1 × 107 cfu mL–1, various amounts of Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O were introduced. The concentration of the antibacterial agent in
the system was, in turn, 0, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512 μg
mL–1. The system was placed in an orbital shaker
at the rotating speed of 180 rpm. After the bacteria were incubated
at 37 °C for 24 h, the OD value of the system at different durations
was measured.

IC50 Test
To obtain the
IC50 value,
the antibacterial agent at the concentrations of 2048, 1024, 512,
256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, and 4 μg mL–1 was
separately prepared through the half times dilution method. Then,
1200 μL of the antibacterial agent at each of the concentrations
was transferred into a sterile test tube. After 200 μL of bacterial
liquid with 2 × 108 cfu mL–1 and
1000 μL of culture solution were added, the concentration of
the antibacterial agent respectively became 1024, 512, 256, 128, 64,
32, 16, 8, 4, and 2 μg mL–1. Furthermore,
a control solution that consisted of 200 μL of the bacterial
liquid with 2 × 108 cfu mL–1 and
2200 μL of culture solution was also prepared. All of the systems
were cultured at 37 °C for 24 h. Their OD600 values were measured
for the calculation of the IC50 value.

Catalytic Activity
for the Reduction of 4-NP
To investigate
the catalytic property of the as-obtained Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O microstructures in the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP
in excess NaBH4 solution, a series of solutions were freshly
prepared before experiment. In a typical process, appropriate amounts
of 4-NP and catalysts were first mixed; then, a certain volume of
NaBH4 solution was introduced into the system to form 3
mL of the solution. Here, the concentrations of 4-NP, NaBH4, and the catalyst were 1.0 × 10–4 mol L–1, 2.0 × 10–2 mol L–1, and 2/4/6/8 mg L–1, respectively. The reduction
processes were monitored using a Metash 6100 UV–vis spectrophotometer.

Conclusions
In summary, Cu2O nanoparticles-strewn
Fe3O4@RF core–shell microstructures have
been successfully
constructed by the reduction of Cu2+ ions on the surfaces
of Fe3O4@RF microstructures modified with the
silane coupling agent KH550. Magnetic property studies showed that
the Ms values of pure Fe3O4, Fe3O4@RF, and Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O were
48.5, 21.7, and 14.4 emu g–1, respectively, indicating
that the Ms of pure Fe3O4 decreased with the
integration of RF and Cu2O in turn. Experiments showed
that the as-obtained Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O microstructures presented multifunctional applications in bio-antibacterial
and organic catalysis fields. The reproductions of E. coli (Gram-negative bacteria) and S. aureus (Gram-positive bacteria) could be efficiently
inhibited under the presence of appropriate amounts of Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O microstructures. The IC50 values against E. coli and S. aureus were 35.8 ± 3.7 and 49.5 ± 2.7
μg mL–1, respectively, implying that the present
antibacterial agent has stronger inhibition against E. coli than against S. aureus. Simultaneously, the as-obtained Fe3O4@RF/Cu2O microstructures also displayed outstanding catalytic activity
for the reduction of 4-NP in excess NaBH4 solution. Under
the presence of 6 mg L–1 catalyst, 1.0 × 10–4 mol L–1 4-NP could be completely
reduced within 4 min. Furthermore, because of its magnetic property,
the present antibacterial agent and the catalyst could also be conveniently
recovered for reuse. After five cycles, the antibacterial efficiency
and the catalytic efficiency were still remaining at 87 and 90%, respectively.
This is obviously favorable to cost savings in practical applications.
