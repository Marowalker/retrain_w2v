A series of solvent-coordinated tin
halide complexes were prepared
as impurity-free precursors for tin halide perovskites, and their
structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.
Using these precursors, the tin halide perovskites, MASnI3 and FASnI3, were prepared, and their electronic structures
and photophysical properties were examined under inert conditions
by means of photoelectron yield spectroscopy as well as absorption
and fluorescence spectroscopies. Their valence bands (MASnI3: −5.02 eV; FASnI3: −5.16 eV) are significantly
higher than those of MAPbI3 or the typical hole-transporting
materials 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene
and poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine). These results
suggest that to develop the solar cells using these tin halide perovskites
with efficient hole-collection properties, hole-transporting materials
should be chosen that have the highest occupied molecular orbital
levels higher than −5.0 eV.

Introduction
Perovskite solar cells
have attracted much attention as the potential
next generation of photovoltaics. Especially, solar cells that use
lead halide perovskites as light-harvesting materials have been intensively
studied.1−4 Even though their performances with respect to power-conversion
efficiencies (PCEs) and durability1−4 have been improved substantially within
only a few years, the inherent toxicity of lead compounds remains
a concern and bottleneck for practical applications. As potential
alternative light-harvesting materials, Sn-based perovskites have
attracted attention, particularly owing to their lower toxicity.5−7 Although the highest reported PCEs of Sn-based perovskite solar
cells are 5–8%,8−11 their performance in photovoltaic devices is still lower than that
of Pb-based perovskite solar cells and moreover suffers from reproducibility
issues. Different from Pb-based solar cells,12 the inferior performance of Sn-based perovskite solar cells should
probably be attributed to the lower quality of the perovskite layer.13 The major difference between materials based
on Pb and Sn is the stability of their divalent ions. In contrast
to Pb2+, Sn2+ is easily oxidized to the more
stable Sn4+. Indeed, Sn-based perovskite materials, such
as MASnI3 (MA: methylammonium, CH3NH3+) and FASnI3 (FA: formamidinium, CH(NH2)2+), are sensitive to oxidation upon
exposure to air. The resulting Sn4+ should subsequently
affect the device performance by self-doping.14,15 For the fabrication of efficient Pb-based perovskite solar cells
with high reproducibility, we have demonstrated that the purity of
the starting materials, such as PbI2, is crucial.16 For Sn-based perovskite solar cells, the preparation
and use of highly purified tin halide precursor materials should be
even more important.

Upon complexation of SnX2 (X
= F, Cl, Br, and I) with
coordinating solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), we developed
a series of purified tin halide materials [SnX2(S)n] (S = DMF and DMSO) in this study. Using
the thus-obtained highly purified precursors, such as [SnI2(dmf)], [SnI2(dmso)], and [SnI2(dmso)2], the Sn-based perovskites MASnI3 and FASnI3 were prepared, and their electronic and optical properties were
examined under inert conditions by means of photoelectron yield spectroscopy
(PYS) and photophysical measurements.

Results
and Discussion
Initially, we analyzed a commercially available
sample of SnI2 (99.9%, trace metals basis, purchased from
Kojundo Chemical
Laboratory Co., Ltd.) by 119Sn magic-angle spinning (MAS)
NMR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Karl Fischer
titration. Surprisingly, the purchased sample of SnI2 contained
up to 10 wt % SnI4, together with ∼10 000
ppm water. In the 119Sn MAS NMR spectrum of the commercial
sample, a signal at −1743 ppm, which arises from the presence
of SnI4, was observed in addition to the signals at −389
and −527 ppm corresponding to SnI2 (Figure 1a).17 TGA measurements revealed a significant weight loss (10.1%) at ∼150
°C, which corresponds to the sublimation of SnI4,
before another substantial weight loss (63.9%) was observed at ∼330
°C, which should be attributed to SnI2 (Figure 1b). On the basis of these results,
we purified SnI2 (10.7 g) by sublimation under reduced
pressure (100 Pa). After removal of SnI4 (2.1 g, 3.4 mmol)
as an orange crystalline powder at 150 °C, further heating to
330 °C afforded SnI2 (7.1 g, 19 mmol) as a red crystalline
powder. According to 119Sn MAS NMR (−585 and −605
ppm)18,19 and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization
mass spectrometry (MS) measurements (Figures S2 and S23), the residual dark brown solid (0.85 g) should consist
mostly of SnO2.

curves of
(a, b) commercially available SnI2 (99.9%, trace metals
basis) and (c, d) sublimated SnI2.

Although SnI4 could be removed by sublimation
(Figure 1c,d), the
sublimed
SnI2 powder afforded yellow solutions upon dissolution
in DMF or DMSO that contained insoluble small brown particles of SnO2, which was confirmed by a mass spectroscopic analysis (Figure S3). This result indicated that one sublimation
should not be sufficient to purify SnI2. As the higher
homologue PbI2 forms complexes with DMF16 and DMSO,20 we tried to further
purify SnI2 by recrystallization from these solvents. For
that purpose, filtered solutions of SnI2 in DMF or DMSO
were layered with toluene or dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). The slow diffusion of toluene into a DMF solution of SnI2 afforded colorless crystalline needles of [SnI2(dmf)], which was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD)
analysis (Figure 2).
In these crystals, one molecule of DMF coordinates to the tin center
[Sn–O: 2.209(2) Å], which results in Sn–I bond
lengths of 2.9744(3) and 3.0065(4) Å for Sn(1)–I(1) and
Sn(1)–I(2), respectively. The packing structure of [SnI2(dmf)] is characterized by a linear alignment. During the
recrystallizations, the choice of antisolvent (less soluble solvent)
was found to determine the nature of the SnI2 complex.
For example, diffusion of CH2Cl2 into a DMF
solution of SnI2 afforded orange crystalline needles of
[Sn3I6(dmf)2] and the 3:2 ratio between
SnI2 and DMF was confirmed by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction
analysis (Figure S5).

Slow diffusion of CH2Cl2 into a DMSO solution
of SnI2 furnished colorless needles of [SnI2(dmso)], which were structurally characterized by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction analysis (Figure 3). In the crystal structure of [SnI2(dmso)],
one molecule of DMSO coordinates to the tin center [Sn–O: 2.167(3)
Å] and the packing structure is defined by a linear alignment.
Interestingly, when toluene was used as the antisolvent in the recrystallization
from DMSO, colorless crystals of [SnI2(dmso)2] were obtained as the only product, in which two molecules of DMSO
coordinate to the tin center (Figure S6). Kanatzidis and co-workers have reported that [SnI2(dmso)3] can be obtained by treating a DMSO solution of MASnI3 with CH2Cl2, which is regarded as an
intermediate in the one-step tin perovskite spin-coating process21 and could also be potentially used for the purification
of tin-based perovskite materials for solar cells. The advantage of
using the [SnI2(dmf)], [SnI2(dmso)], and [SnI2(dmso)2] complexes obtained in the present study
as precursor materials is that they are prepared with relative ease
from SnI2 solutions. Although these complexes are also
air sensitive, they can be stored in vial containers under inert condition
(O2, H2O < 10 ppm). Although both of SnI2 and SnI4 are red solids (Figure S1), these SnI2 complexes are colorless crystalline solids. SnI2 complexes immediately turn reddish brown upon exposure to air, suggesting
that the purity of these complexes can be checked by the naked eye.

In analogy to the SnI2 complexes, several solvent-coordinated
tin complexes containing other halides, such as [SnBr2(dmf)],
[SnBr2(dmso)2], [SnCl2(dmf)], and
[Sn2F4(dmso)2]22 were obtained in a similar fashion. Their structures were
unambiguously determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses
(Figures S7–S10), and their purity
was confirmed by elemental analysis and 119Sn MAS NMR spectroscopy
(see SI). All of these tin halide complexes
can be used as purified precursor materials for tin-based perovskites.
In addition to their high purity, these tin halide complexes offer
the advantage that their solutions can be prepared rapidly. For example,
the preparation of a 1.5 M solution of sublimed SnI2 in
DMF or DMSO requires more than 30 min stirring, whereas [SnI2(dmf)], [SnI2(dmso)], [SnI2(dmso)2], or other such complexes dissolve immediately (<10 min) in these
solvents (Figure S11).

To demonstrate
the utility of these complexes as purified precursors
for tin halide perovskite materials, and to investigate their properties,
crystalline powders and films of MASnI3 and FASnI3 were prepared using [SnI2(dmf)] or [SnI2(dmso)2] in an Ar-filled glove box (O2, H2O
< 10 ppm). Crystalline powder samples of MASnI3 and
FASnI3 were prepared from a 1.0 M EtOH solution of SnI2(dmf) and methylammonium iodide (MAI) or formamidinium iodide
(FAI) using a temperature gradient from 80 °C to room temperature.
The film samples were prepared by a one-step solution method, that
is, a 1.5 M DMSO solution of [SnI2(dmso)2] and
MAI or FAI in a 1:1 ratio was deposited on a quartz substrate by spin-coating.
After thermal annealing at 100 °C, black films were obtained.
The formation of MASnI3 and FASnI3 was confirmed
by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses of the crystalline powders and
films using synchrotron and Cu Kα radiation, respectively (Figure 4b,d). The XRD patterns
of the crystalline powder samples, which were enclosed in glass capillaries
after grinding under Ar, showed peaks quite similar to those of the
simulated patterns for the corresponding perovskite crystals (Figure 4a,c).23,24 The film samples were covered with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)
by spin-coating to protect the films from oxidation by air during
the XRD measurements. The film samples of MASnI3 and FASnI3 also showed peaks similar to the simulations, whereas the
XRD pattern for the film of MASnI3 showed strong preferred
orientations along the (100) direction, which is consistent with the
report in the literature.24

and Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), respectively.
Simulated XRD patterns from cell parameters of tetragonal-MASnI3 and orthorhombic-FASnI323,24 are shown for comparison.

To find suitable applications for tin halide perovskite materials
in the development of solar cells, it should be important to gain
a better understanding of their inherent electronic structures. Using
a powder sample of purified SnI2, we examined the valence
band (VB) by means of PYS under vacuum (<10–2 Pa). The PYS spectra of MASnI3 and FASnI3 (Figure 5a) revealed onset
positions, based on (yield)1/3, for the VB maxima of MASnI3 and FASnI3 at −5.02 and −5.16 eV,
respectively. Interestingly, these values are intermediate relative
to previously reported values (MASnI3: −4.7525 or −5.47 eV;26 FASnI3: −4.727 or −5.96
eV28). Compared to the VBs of the lead
halide perovskite MAPbI3 (−5.45 eV)29 and typical hole-collection materials such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene
(Spiro-OMeTAD; −5.1 eV)29 and poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine)
(PTAA; −5.2 eV),26 the VBs of these
tin halide perovskites are relatively high. These results suggest
that in the corresponding tin-based perovskite solar cells, a pairing
with hole-transporting materials (HTMs) that exhibit high highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels should be necessary to ensure
efficient hole collection.

Subsequently, we examined the
absorption and photoluminescence
(PL) spectra of films of MASnI3 and FASnI3.
Whereas the PL measurements were carried out on PMMA-covered film
samples under Ar, absorption spectra were recorded in air after the
PL measurements. The MASnI3 film exhibited the PL peak
position at 1.28 eV with a full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of 110
meV determined by Gaussian fitting and an absorption onset at 1.3
eV (Figure 5b; red
line). These values are in good agreement with previously reported
ones (1.30,8,26 1.26 eV25). On the other hand, the FASnI3 film showed a PL peak
at 1.44 eV with a wider fwhm (160 meV), whereas the absorption onset
was observed at ∼1.6 eV (Figure 5b; blue line). After several measurements, we found
that the PL peak of FASnI3 is more sensitive to oxidation
than that of MASnI3 (Figure S12 ).30 The large difference between the
PL peak and the absorption edge should originate from the rapid oxidation
upon exposure to ambient conditions, leading to a blue shift during
the absorption measurement. To suppress the oxidation, we added 10
mol % SnF2, which is widely used as a stabilizer,10,11,31 to the Sn-based perovskite precursor
solution. XRD measurements on the thus-obtained film confirmed that
the crystal structure of FASnI3 was not affected by the
presence of 10 mol % SnF2 (Figure S13). The FASnI3 film containing 10 mol % SnF2 exhibited a narrower PL (fwhm: 110 meV) with a peak at 1.40 eV and
an absorption onset at ∼1.4 eV (Figure 5b; green line). These values are also in
good agreement with previously reported values (1.41,28 1.4 eV27). On the basis of these
results, we determined the band gaps of MASnI3 (1.28 eV)
and FASnI3 (1.40 eV). Consequently, the conduction band
(CB) minima of MASnI3 (−3.74 eV) and FASnI3 (−3.76 eV) were estimated on the basis of the VBs determined
by PYS (Figure 5).

Conclusions
In summary, we prepared a series of tin halide complexes that contain
DMF or DMSO. [SnI2(dmf)] and [SnI2(dmso)2] were used as soluble purified precursor materials to generate
the Sn-based perovskites, MASnI3 and FASnI3.
The electronic and photophysical properties, including the VBs and
CBs, of MASnI3 and FASnI3 were examined using
XRD analyses, as well as PYS and photophysical spectroscopy measurements.
The CBs of MASnI3 and FASnI3 are slightly higher
than that of MAPbI3, whereas the VBs (MASnI3: −5.02 eV; FASnI3: −5.16 eV) are significantly
higher, even when compared to typical hole-transporting materials
such as Spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA or to MAPbI3. These results
suggest that in the interest of developing Sn-based perovskite solar
cells with efficient hole-collection properties, hole-transporting
materials should be chosen that exhibit the HOMO level higher than
−5.0 eV. In line with this device design principle, the development
of efficient Sn-based perovskite solar cells using such purified tin
halide materials is currently in progress in our laboratory and the
results will be reported in due course.
