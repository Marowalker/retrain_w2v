A silver(I)-promoted
cascade reaction was developed for the synthesis
of cyclic carbonates from terminal propargylic alcohols, carbon dioxide,
and vicinal diols. Compared with direct condensation of vicinal diols
with CO2, this protocol provides a thermodynamically favorable
route to cyclic carbonates and α-hydroxyl ketones in excellent
yields (up to 97%) without the additional dehydration step. Such a
cascade procedure
proceeds presumably through initial reaction of propargylic alcohol
with CO2 and subsequent nucleophilic attack of vicinal
alcohol on in situ-formed α-alkylidene cyclic carbonate, resulting
in successive generation of α-alkylidene cyclic carbonate, unsymmetrical
β-oxoalkyl carbonate, cyclic carbonate, and α-hydroxyl
ketone.

==== Body
Introduction
Carbon dioxide, as
an abundant, readily available, nontoxic, and
nonflammable carbon resource, is becoming a powerful synthon and useful
C1 building block for the preparation of value-added chemicals.1 Cyclic carbonates, as one of the products from
CO2 chemistry, are a class of heterocycles with a wide
range of applications, being commonly used as polar aprotic solvents,
electrolytes in batteries, monomers in the synthesis of polycarbonates,
and reaction intermediates in the manufacture of fine chemicals.2 To date, numerous effective processes have been
reported to prepare various cyclic carbonates from readily available
CO2, as an alternative feedstock to carbon monoxide and
phosgene, such as cycloaddition of epoxides with CO2,1b,2b−2d carboxylative cyclization of propargylic alcohols
with CO2,3 direct condensation
of vicinal diols and CO2,4 and
so on. Among these methodologies, cycloaddition of epoxides and CO2 with 100% atom economy has been extensively investigated,
and a large number of catalysts have been reported so far.1b,2b−2d However, particular operation is required, owing
to the toxicity and reactivity associated with use of epoxides.5

On the other hand, direct condensation
of vicinal diols with CO2 can be considered as an alternative
access to cyclic carbonates
because 1,2-diols can be manufactured from biomass6 and water is the only by-product (Scheme 1a). In this respect, the established protocols
with a variety of metal-based catalysts, such as Ce,4a Sn,4b,4g Mg,4d and so forth, have been reported. However, the conversion of vicinal
diols and yields of cyclic carbonates were unsatisfactory in most
instances (e.g., 3.8% propylene carbonate yield with a Mg catalyst),
even under harsh reaction conditions (generally >150 °C, 10
MPa),
because of the thermodynamic limitationa and/or
inactivation of the catalysts by the water formed as a co-product
during the reaction. Therefore, removal of water
is crucial for overcoming the equilibrium limitation, and methodologies
using nitrile4c,4f,4h,4j as a dehydrating agent have been employed
to shift the equilibrium to favor the formation of cyclic carbonate.
Despite the considerable progress that has been seen, exploring efficacious
catalytic approaches for the production of cyclic carbonates directly,
starting from vicinal diols and CO2, could be still highly
desirable and worthwhile.

Scheme 1 Conversion of CO2 with Vicinal
Diol
In recent years, reactions
of propargylic alcohols with CO2 have been well developed,
to prepare organic carbonates,3,7 carbamates,3f,8 oxazolidinones,9 3(2H)-furanones,10 and α-hydroxyl ketones.11 These
preparative procedures likely proceed through a reaction sequence
involving carboxylative cyclization of propargylic alcohols with CO2 and subsequent attack of the nucleophile with in situ-generated
α-alkylidene cyclic carbonate. β-Oxoalkyl carbonates,
also relatively useful compounds in synthetic chemistry,12 are generally prepared via three-component cascade
reactions of propargylic alcohol, CO2, and monohydric alcohol
(Scheme 1b).3d,7d In this context, we speculated that β-oxoalkyl carbonate,
with an appropriate nucleophilic species (e.g., hydroxyl group) in
one molecule, which could be generated from a three-component reaction
of propargylic alcohol, CO2, and vicinal diol, presumably
undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic reaction, thus resulting
in the formation of cyclic carbonate and elimination of α-hydroxyl
ketone simultaneously. As such, dehydration can be avoided and the
thermodynamically limited synthesis of cyclic carbonates from direct
condensation of vicinal diols with CO2 and formation of
α-hydroxyl ketones from propargylic alcohols11 are well cooperated in a thermodynamically favored manner
[Scheme 1c, ΔrG298.15 K = −40.6
kcal mol–1, Table S2].
Herein, we would like to report an alternative strategy to concurrently
afford cyclic carbonates and α-hydroxyl ketones from propargylic
alcohols, CO2, and vicinal diols via a three-component
one-pot strategy.

Results and Discussion
α-Alkylidene
cyclic carbonate has been proven to be the vital
intermediate in the cascade reaction of propargylic alcohol, CO2, and an alcoholic nucleophile.3d,7b,7d,12a On the other hand,
silver compounds have been found to be efficient in catalyzing the
carboxylative cyclization of propargylic alcohols with CO2 to prepare α-alkylidene cyclic carbonates.3a,3b,3f,3h,3i Therefore, we initially explored the silver-promoted
reaction of propane-1,2-diol (1a) and α-alkylidene
cyclic carbonate IM-1 to validate our hypothesis. As
shown in Table 1, no
expected product was detected, with full recovery of 1a and IM-1, without any catalyst (entry 1). Gratifyingly,
propylene carbonate (3a) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutan-2-one
(α-hydroxyl ketone 4a) were obtained in the presence
of Ag2CO3 (entry 2). Although triphenyl phosphine
itself was found to be inactive under the given conditions (entry
3), addition of PPh3 greatly enhanced the catalytic efficiency
(entry 4 vs 2).

Subsequently, a
series of silver compounds were screened, in combination
with PPh3 (entries 5–11). It was observed that
AgOAc, Ag2WO4, Ag3PO4,
and Ag2O showed promising activity (entries 5–8).
However, AgCl, AgI, and AgNO3 did not work at all (entries
9–11).

Encouraged by the results, the three-component
reaction of propargylic
alcohol 2a, CO2, and vicinal diol 1a was selected as a model reaction to further investigate the one-pot
synthesis of cyclic carbonate 3a, with the coproduction
of α-hydroxyl ketone 4a. As summarized in Table 2, no reaction occurred
without a catalyst (entry 1). Then, several representative silver
compounds as π-Lewis acidic species were primarily screened
in conjunction with Ph3P (entries 2–7). Silver compounds,
such as Ag2CO3, Ag2O, AgOAc, and
Ag2WO4, effectively promoted the three-component
cascade reaction, with the assistance of PPh3, to afford
cyclic carbonate 3a and α-hydroxyl ketone 4a in moderate yield (entries 2–5). However, AgNO3 and AgBF4 displayed no activity (entries 6 and
7). These results suggest the role of alkalinity of the silver catalyst.
Furthermore, both Ag2CO3 and PPh3 alone were found to be ineffective (entries 8 and 9), hinting that
[(PPh3)2Ag]2CO3 may be
the active species.3f,13

Various mono- and bi-dentate phosphines (L2–L7) were examined (entries 10–16). All
phosphines selected as ligands gave the desired products in good yields,
and electron-rich bidentate phosphine L6, with a large
bite angle, exhibited the highest efficiency, affording 3a and 4a in excellent yields (entry 15). Excellent results
could also be obtained on reducing the CO2 pressure to
1.0 MPa (entry 17), whereas further decrease in the pressure to 1
bar gave poor results (entry 18). Therefore, a suitable reaction pressure
could be 1.0 MPa.

With the establishment of suitable reaction
conditions, the generality
of this three-component reaction was explored, as listed in Table 3. In the presence
of 5 mol % of Ag2CO3 and 10 mol % of L6 under a 1.0 MPa CO2 atmosphere at 80 °C, symmetrical
ethylene glycol 1b gave ethylene carbonate 3b in 84% yield and 4a in 89% yield (entry 2). Meanwhile,
methyl-, ethyl-, n-propyl-, phenyl-, and phenoxymethyl-substituted
unsymmetrical vicinal diols 1a, 1c, 1d, 1e, and 1f were efficiently
converted into the corresponding cyclic carbonates 3a, 3c, 3d, 3e, and 3f, respectively (entries 1 and 3–6).

Glycerol carbonate, a kind of heterocyclic
compound, is commonly
used in polymer synthesis.14 Ideally, it
is prepared through the carboxylation of glycerol with CO2, which represents a sustainable process that is able to convert
two cheap materials into a valuable chemical, with water as the by-product.
However, a high pressure is usually required. However, the productivity
is low, probably owing to the thermodynamic limitation.4g,15 In this work, this obstacle could be surmounted through the design
of a protocol to concurrently obtain two value-added products with
100% atom economy; thus, glycerol carbonate could be obtained by employing
the Ag(I)-promoted cascade reaction of terminal propargylic alcohols,
CO2, and vicinal diols in a one-pot process. For example, 3g was obtained in 80% yield together with 4a in 91% yield (entry 7). To our delight, a high yield of 3g was also acquired in a “gram-scale” experiment (Scheme 2). Accordingly, this
protocol also offers an alternative route to the production of glycerol
carbonate from glycerol and CO2. Moreover, several other
alkyl- and phenyl-substituted propargylic alcohols (2b–e) also afforded the desired cyclic carbonate, 3a, successfully and α-hydroxyl ketones 4b–e concomitantly (entries 11–14).

Scheme 2 Practical Synthesis of Glycerol Carbonate on a Gram Scale
Notably, the configuration
of 4e, with the retention
of stereochemistry, was unambiguously confirmed by single-crystal
X-ray analysis
(Supporting Information).b Interestingly, this protocol was also applied to the synthesis
of sterically congested cyclic carbonates such as 3h and 3i (entries 8 and 9) and the six-membered cyclic carbonate, 3j (entry 10).

To verify the reaction pathway, several
control experiments were
conducted, as described in Scheme 3. As expected, the reaction of 2-methylbut-3-yn-2-ol 2a with CO2 in the absence of propane-1,2-diol
(1a) gave α-alkylidene cyclic carbonate IM-1 (Scheme 3a).

Scheme 3 Preliminary Mechanistic Studies
Moreover, 1a did not react with CO2 under
the given conditions (Scheme 3b), indicating that direct condensation of 1,2-diol with CO2 in the presence of a silver catalyst did not happen at all.
However, α-alkylidene cyclic carbonate IM-1 well
reacted with 1a, affording the targeted cyclic carbonate, 3a, along with the simultaneous formation α-hydroxyl
ketone 4a as a co-product smoothly (Scheme 3c). Accordingly, the α-alkylidene
cyclic carbonate was confirmed as the carbonyl source.

Furthermore,
labeling experiments were also carried out to further
understand the reaction mechanism. When 1a reacted with
the 13C-labeled α-alkylidene cyclic carbonate, IM-1′, from 13CO2, a 13Ccarbonyl-labeled cyclic carbonate (3a′) was obtained smoothly (Scheme 3d). Meanwhile, the treatment of deuterated phenyl-substituted
1,2-diol (3e′) with α-alkylidene cyclic
carbonate IM-2 gave the deuterated α-hydroxyl ketonec (Scheme 3e). These results demonstrated that the α-alkylidene
cyclic carbonate from CO2 is the unique carbonyl source
and the protons of the vicinal diol are eventually incorporated into
the α-hydroxyl ketone.

On the basis of the above-described
results and previous reports,3,7−12 we proposed a reaction pathway as depicted in Scheme 4. The α-alkylidene cyclic carbonate
intermediate is first generated through the reaction of propargylic
alcohol 2 with CO2,3,7−12 which then undergoes a nucleophilic ring-opening reaction by vicinal
diol to generate the corresponding hydroxyl-substituted unsymmetrical
carbonate, A. The silver catalyst presumably activates
the hydroxyl of intermediate A,3f thus resulting in an intramolecular nucleophilic cyclization to
afford cyclic carbonate 3 and α-hydroxyl ketone 4 concurrently.

Scheme 4 Proposed Reaction Pathway
Conclusions
In summary, we have
developed an efficient silver(I)-promoted three-component
protocol comprising terminal propargylic alcohols, carbon dioxide,
and vicinal diols for expeditious utilization of CO2 to
concurrently prepare cyclic carbonates from vicinal diols and CO2 in a thermodynamically favorable manner, along with the formation
of α-hydroxyl ketones. This is a versatile “one-pot”
approach to prepare valuable products, and CO2 is used
as both a carbonyl and oxygen source to form C–O and C=O
bonds simultaneously. Notably, the unfavorable thermodynamic
equilibrium in the condensation reaction of vicinal diols with CO2 is not involved when using this cascade three-component strategy
to cyclic carbonates, with no need for a dehydration process.
