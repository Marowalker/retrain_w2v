In this work, CdS
nanoparticles were grown on top of a hematite
(α-Fe2O3) film as photoanodes for the
photoelectrochemical water splitting. Such type of composition was
chosen to enhance the electrical conductivity and photoactivity of
traditionally used bare hematite nanostructures. The fabricated thin
film was probed by various physicochemical, electrochemical, and optical
techniques, revealing high crystallinity of the prepared nanocomposite
and the presence of two distinct phases with different band gaps.
Furthermore, photoassisted water splitting tests exhibit a noteworthy
photocurrent of 0.6 mA/cm2 and a relatively low onset potential
of 0.4 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) for the composite electrode.
The high photocurrent generation ability was attributed to the synergistic
interplay between conduction and valence band (VB) levels of CdS and
α-Fe2O3, which was further interpreted
by J–V curves. Finally, electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy investigation of the obtained films suggests
that the photogenerated holes could be transferred from the VB of
α-Fe2O3 to the electrolyte more efficiently
in the hybrid nanostructure.

Introduction
The requirement of
continuously growing energy demand can be compensated
by means of utilizing solar energy. After continuous efforts, one
of the major breakthroughs has been to harness solar photons to split
water. The process commonly known as photoelectrochemical (PEC) water
splitting is a compelling approach of harvesting solar energy into
chemical energy stored as hydrogen in an environmentally friendly
manner. For the advancement of such systems, semiconductor nanostructures
have gained wide attention to develop cleaner energy conversion systems.1 It has been investigated that a material must
confirm to a number of firm requirements for efficient photoassisted
water splitting, which include (i) light absorption in visible region,
(ii) efficient charge carrier separation and transportation, (iii)
fast charge-transfer kinetics at the interface between liquid and
solid, (iv) appropriate positions of the conduction and valence band
(VB) energy levels with respect to required reaction potentials, and
(v) respectable stability in aqueous solutions.1 Although such systems have been heavily investigated, a
suitable candidate still does not exist, which can satisfy all of
these conditions.2,3 Recent advances in nanoscience
and electrochemistry have made significant strides toward developing
a material capable of efficiently converting photons from sunlight
into chemical fuels.4,5 In this concern, a number of semiconductors
have been incorporated as photoelectrode materials for water splitting
applications.6−8 Among them, hematite (α-Fe2O3) is one of the most suitable materials for photoanode,5,9−13 with an optical band gap of around 1.9–2.2 eV,14 for harvesting solar light, corresponding to
a high theoretical STH (solar-to-hydrogen) conversion efficiency of
14–17%.15 However, practical STH
conversion efficiencies of reported hematite photoanodes are considerably
lower because of their very short excited-state lifetime (<10 ps),16 short hole diffusion length (≈2–4
nm),17 poor surface oxygen evolution reaction
kinetics,18 and poor electrical conductivity
(10–6 Ω–1 cm–1).19 In an attempt to alleviate these
issues, various attempts have been made to develop unique nanostructures
with hematite that are either doped or composited with materials of
a similar band gap. CdS is a promising semiconductor with a band gap
of about 2.4 eV; however, it suffers from photocorrosive effects in
aqueous media. One of the ways to increase the stability of CdS is
to couple it with a material of a similar band gap so as to create
a homogeneous phase and facilitate fast charge transfer for catalyzing
the water splitting reaction, thus increasing the photocurrent. For
example, Wang et al. have decorated CdS nanoparticles with α-Fe2O3 and have found increased photocatalytic activity.20 Similarly, Zhu et al. have synthesized TiO2/CdS nanocomposites that have high activity toward methylene
blue degradation under solar irradiation.21 Tang et al. have synthesized novel Fe2O3/CdS
nanostructures for use in real-time PEC probing of Cu2+.22 However, to the best of our knowledge,
no comprehensive study exists on the use of α-Fe2O3/CdS as a photoelectrode for water splitting, although
there are a few studies on the use of composite heterojunction catalysts
for the purpose of photoassisted degradation of organic compounds,23 which include p–n24 and n–n25 heterojunctions.

In the present work, a facile two-stage process
has been utilized to deposit a thin film of α-Fe2O3/CdS composite over a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated
glass electrode. Furthermore, the applicability of an as-designed
thin film in PEC water splitting was extensively investigated by various
techniques. Finally, several new insights on interfacial phenomenon
and synergistic effects have been elucidated. To the best of our knowledge,
we report for the first time the α-Fe2O3/CdS composite-based thin film as photoanodes for PEC water splitting.
Moreover, the synergistic interplay between energy band levels of
CdS and α-Fe2O3 has been demonstrated,
which was supported and authenticated by J–V and impedance spectroscopic experiments.

Results and Discussion
The heterostructured α-Fe2O3/CdS thin
film was deposited directly on an FTO glass substrate by a facile two-step method. In the first step, the hydrothermal reaction
between FeCl3 and NaNO3 at 98 °C leaves
a thin layer of α-Fe2O3 on the FTO glass
substrate, and subsequent chemical bath sensitization by Cd(NO3)2 and Na2S solution in the second step
forms α-Fe2O3/CdS assembly (Scheme 1). The as-synthesized α-Fe2O3/CdS thin film was characterized by various advanced
characterization techniques such as ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis),
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and so forth.

Characterization of the α-Fe2O3/CdS
Thin Film
Figure 1a–c shows the morphology of the as-obtained thin films,
with pure α-Fe2O3 shown in Figure 1a and the α-Fe2O3/CdS composite depicted in Figure 1c. The α-Fe2O3/CdS thin film comprises a mesoporous hematite layer, on which “islands”
of CdS nanoparticles are observed (Figure 1b). In the bare hematite thin film, only
rodlike structures of 60–70 nm in width and ∼450 nm
in length are observed. A similar structure, although more porous,
with a reduced width of ∼40–50 nm is seen for the α-Fe2O3/CdS nanocomposite. The average width of these
islands is estimated to be around 1.2 μm (Figure 1c). It can be concluded from the SEM observations
that the sensitization process with CdS improves the active surface
area of the as-prepared electrodes (also verified by AFM analysis, Figure S1 and Table S1).

images obtained at different magnifications.

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
images
of the composite film are seen in Figure 1d,e, whereas the TEM images are shown in Figure 2. Clusters of nanoparticles
assembled on the substrate, with an outwardly rodlike architecture
in the HRTEM images, which is in agreement with the SEM observations.
Upon further magnification, small islands of bloblike structures are
identified, which may be representative of agglomeration in the sample.
Multiple such clusters are found, and upon further magnification,
it is observed that fringes are seen with good distribution of nanoparticles.
Moreover, the presence of randomly oriented fringes overlapping each
other is indicative of polycrystalline nature of the composite material
(Figure 2).27 The representative selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) pattern as shown in the inset of Figure 2a shows multiple bright spots with prominent
ringlike shape. The presence of bright spots in a concentric ringlike
shape indicates a highly crystalline nature of the composite. However,
because of the nature of the nanocomposite, there is an overlap between
the planes of the constituents of the nanocomposite.27Figure 2b,d shows the magnified views of areas highlighted in Figure 2a,c. Finely oriented fringes
are seen, and the interplanar spacings were determined to be 0.221
and 0.350 nm. The constituents of the nanocomposite are further confirmed
by means of energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) measurement, which
is shown in Figure S2. Furthermore, the
film thickness is found to be between 400 and 500 nm by analyzing
the height of a nanoparticle cluster in cross-sectional TEM images.
High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) images are shown in Figure 3. It is observed
that all constituents are clearly visible and well-dispersed in the
composite. CdS nanoparticles are dispersed evenly over the surface
of the α-Fe2O3 nanostructures, thus forming
an interfacial junction. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were indexed
to the characteristic peaks, and based on indexing, four phases were
identified in the sample: α-Fe2O3 (JCPDS
33-0664), cubic CdS (JCPDS 80-0019), hexagonal CdS (JCPDS 41-1049),
and SnO2 (JCPDS 41-1445). A strong (110) diffraction is
obtained compared with other planes for hematite, indicating that
hematite nanostructures are oriented along the (110) direction on
the FTO substrate. This result is largely consistent with the previous
studies.28 On the other hand, one incidence
of cubic CdS is encountered while the remaining diffraction peaks
correspond to (004) and (204) planes (Figure 4).

thin films on the FTO glass substrate.

The absorption spectrum for pure α-Fe2O3 shows an absorption edge at about 580 nm (Figure 5), which corresponds roughly
to a band gap
of 2.2 eV, whereas CdS shows an absorption edge at around 442 nm,
corresponding to a band gap of 2.7 eV. A representative band diagram
based on commonly reported band gap values for α-Fe2O3 and CdS is shown in Figure 6, based on the contemporary literature20,29 as well as from the UV–vis results. It is to be noted that
α-Fe2O3 is widely reported to be an indirect
band gap semiconductor,30−32 whereas CdS is generally accepted
to be a direct band gap semiconductor.33−35 Hence, any heterojunction
or composite would be assumed to have both direct and indirect electronic
transitions. To evaluate the presence of direct or indirect band gaps,
Tauc plots for both direct and indirect band gaps were compared and
computed using the following equation  where A is a proportionality
constant, h is Planck’s constant, ν
is the frequency, and Eg refers to the
band gap of the material.

thin films.

The value of n depends on the type of transition.
They are given as 2, 1/2, 3, and 3/2 corresponding to allowed direct,
allowed indirect, disallowed direct, and disallowed indirect transitions,
respectively. The Tauc plot derivatives for direct and indirect transitions
are presented in Figure 7a,b. It is found that the composite material comprises both a direct
and an indirect band gap as a result of synergistic effect between
the two nanoparticle systems. On the basis of goodness of fit of derivative
of the Tauc plot and linearity of the plot itself, it is concluded
that the composite material comprises both a direct and an indirect
band gap corresponding to CdS and α-Fe2O3 at 2.78 and 2.18 eV, respectively, which are in good agreement with
the values reported previously.30−36 Moreover, it is expected that the combination of direct and indirect
transitions will help increase the photoactivity and hence the photocurrent
of the PEC device. Additionally, no absolute changes were observed
in the indirect band gap of the nanocomposite film with respect to
the pure hematite films. Thus, it can be concluded that the addition
of CdS does not create intermediate levels in the hematite crystal
structure, albeit it adds its own energy levels because of the formation
of heterojunction.

Current Density–Voltage Characterization of a PEC Cell
Current density–voltage measurements were carried out in
a PEC cell comprising an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a platinum counter
electrode, and an α-Fe2O3/CdS working
electrode with 1 M NaOH + 0.1 M Na2S chosen as the working
electrolyte to minimize the possibility of hole–electron recombinations
at surface trap states.37 The photocurrent
density obtained under incident light of 1000 W/m2 incident
solar radiation is given in Figure 8. The photocurrent for the bare hematite sample is
negligible, as has been verified independently in various other reports.28 However, the nanocomposite α-Fe2O3/CdS shows a photocurrent of 0.6 mA/cm2 at
−0.08 V versus Ag/AgCl, corresponding to a voltage of 0.92
V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) . This value of potential
is lower than the theoretical bias voltage required for water splitting,
which is otherwise reported earlier by Abe et al.38 and confirms that the reaction is one of the solar energy
conversions.39 Moreover, the onset potential
for photocurrent is around −0.6 V versus Ag/AgCl or 0.4 V versus
RHE. This relatively fast onset may be attributed to faster water
oxidation kinetics because of the synergistic effect of CdS and α-Fe2O3 nanostructures40 and
is one of the lowest reported onset potentials in photoelectrodes
comprising α-Fe2O3 as one of the constituents,41,42 barring very few reports on hematite-based photoanodes43,44 and a few on photoelectrodes based on other materials.38,39,45 The relative performance of the
α-Fe2O3/CdS electrodes may be attributed
to an increase in absorption in the visible light range and the presence
of fast charge separation kinetics at the interface of the two materials
because of proper conduction band (CB) and VB alignment between the
two phases in the electrode.46 A comparison
of the current–voltage characteristics and onset potential
of our work with the contemporary literature has been made, as shown
in Table 1.

illumination.

The same J–V experiments
were repeated for the α-Fe2O3/CdS electrodes
in an electrolyte containing 1 M NaOH in the absence of Na2S, and it was found that the presence of Na2S has a positive
effect of cathodically shifting the onset potential by about 200 mV
and the peak potential by around 80 mV, as is evident in Figure S3, which shows a comparison of current
density–voltage curves obtained with only 1 M NaOH and with
1 M NaOH + 0.1 M Na2S as the electrolyte. However, the
photocurrent remains unaffected, indicating that there is no influence
of the presence of Na2S in the electrolyte on the maximum
attainable catalytic activity at the potential range in which photocurrent
is observed in our experiment.47,48 The lowered onset potential
in the presence of Na2S is attributed to the reduction
of hole–electron recombination in the presence of Na2S.37,47

To understand the semiconductor characteristics
of the composite
electrode, Mott–Schottky analysis was performed and the results
are presented in Figure 9. It is found that the flat band potential is around 0.02 V versus
Ag/AgCl, which is anomalous and may be related to charging of the
surface states on the electrode material.18 The slope of the Mott–Schottky plot is negative, which generally
indicates p-type conductivity of the semiconductor.49 However, this is sometimes erroneous and is attributed
to the formation of a very thin surface charge layer caused by ionic
diffusion, as discovered by Macaluso’s group in the case of
ZnO films grown on the InP substrate.50 The dominant n-type conductivity of the composite is strengthened
by mainly anodic photocurrents as is observed in the J–V curves presented earlier.51 Furthermore, a flat region at higher positive bias voltage
indicates the presence of increased charge carriers at the interface,52 as a result of surface-state charging,53 which supports the earlier statement of possible
formation of a surface charge layer.

Figure 9 Mott–Schottky plot for the α-Fe2O3/CdS electrode.

The hypothetical half-cell STH (HC-STH) conversion efficiency
was
calculated for the three-electrode system utilized for the PEC measurements
using the following formula as suggested by Hisatomi et al.54  

Substituting for the values
of EO2/H2O (which
is 1.23 V) and ERHE (0.87 V), wherein
we get a photocurrent of 0.58 mA/cm2, and assuming Psun = 100 mW/cm2, we thus get HC-STH
in percentage as 0.20% at 0.87 V versus
RHE for the α-Fe2O3/CdS system (Figure 10). Although no
studies currently exist on the HC-STH values of α-Fe2O3/CdS composite electrode-based PEC systems, the value
of HC-STH is comparable with at least one other study.55

a PEC system comprising 1 M NaOH + 0.1 M Na2S electrolyte
and a 100 mW/cm2 solar illumination source. The electrode
was lit for at least 1 min before readings were taken to ensure stability.

EIS Analysis of the PEC
Cell
The electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) of the as-prepared α-Fe2O3/CdS nanocomposite films is shown in Figure 11 under dark and under illumination along
with the EIS spectrum for bare α-Fe2O3 electrode provided for comparison. The ac response of the PEC cell
was modeled based on a serial-layer model of two-component ceramics,
which was first implemented for solar water splitting by Shen et al.56 The obtained EIS data are presented as a Nyquist
plot comprising two semicircles and modeled as per a simple resistor–capacitor
(RC)-element-based circuit shown in the inset of Figure 11. According to
the model proposed by Shen et al.,56 the
smaller time constant (t = RC) represents
the space charge layer inside of the semiconductor, whereas the larger
time constant represents interfacial processes at the electrode–electrolyte
interface.

with and without
solar illumination. (a) Full range with boxed region in high frequency
range. (Inset) Equivalent circuit utilized for fitting EIS data. (b)
Magnification of high frequency portion of (a).

The circuit diagram as shown in the inset of Figure 11 is represented by the following
equation  where RSC and CSC represent the contributions
from the space
charge region of the semiconductor, whereas Rint and Cint represent the contributions
due to processes at the electrode–electrolyte interface.

The values of fitting parameters of EIS data are shown in Table 2, fitted as per the
circuit diagram shown in Figure 11. The value of Rser includes
contributions from connecting wires as well as the resistance of the
FTO glass substrate. On the basis of the EIS fitting results, it is
seen that the interfacial resistance decreases under illumination
as compared to under dark for the composite electrode. Furthermore,
both the interfacial and the space charge resistances are decreased
for the α-Fe2O3/CdS composite electrode,
compared with the bare α-Fe2O3 electrode,
further made clear by closely examining the high frequency portion
of the impedance spectra (Figure 11b). This can be explained by the formation of heterojunction
at the interface of CdS and α-Fe2O3. Because
the VB of CdS is lower than that of α-Fe2O3, any electrons generated at the CB of CdS would be transferred to
the CB of α-Fe2O3. This leads to an increase
in carrier concentration upon photoexcitation, which increases the
photoconductivity of the composite. The decrease in interfacial resistance
may be attributed to improved ionic conductivity because of the addition
of CdS.57,58 An increase in capacitance is observed for
both components because the electromagnetic field created by the motion
of charge carriers creates a capacitance at the surface of the α-Fe2O3/CdS nanostructures.59

The rationale for selecting two RC elements in
the circuit is justified by the Bode plots of real and imaginary parts
of complex impedance (Figure 12), which clearly display two peaks corresponding to two time
constants in the electrical impedance behavior of the PEC system.
Furthermore, the Bode plots reconfirm the observations made through
the Nyquist plot, wherein the difference between the two plateaus
observed in Figure 12a is directly proportional to the diameter of the complex plane semicircle
in the Nyquist plot.60 Furthermore, Figure 12a confirms that
the polarization resistance is lower for α-Fe2O3/CdS heterostructures in comparison with bare α-Fe2O3 electrode and is further lowered by illumination.61,62 The polarization resistance is directly correlated with charge-transfer
and space charge resistance by various studies.63,64

Figure 12 Bode plots of (a) real and (b) imaginary parts of complex impedance
versus frequency for α-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3/CdS electrodes (with and without illumination).

The results obtained here in the
EIS analysis are thus consistent
with the increase in photocurrent, the reduction in charge transfer
and interfacial resistance, and enhanced properties because of the
synergistic effect, which is also seen in the current–voltage
curve, presented earlier.

Conclusions
In
summary, the α-Fe2O3/CdS heterostructure
was fabricated on the FTO glass substrate using a facile two-stage method with only one step of heat treatment to improve upon some
of the shortcomings of the base materials. The resultant composite
is highly crystalline and stable under standard testing conditions
for PEC water splitting. A photocurrent of 0.6 mA/cm2 at
0.92 V versus RHE is observed with HC-STH efficiency of 0.20%. Moreover,
the heterojunction has a very low onset potential of 0.4 V versus
RHE, which makes it attractive for systems, wherein water splitting
can be initiated with a minimum electrical input. UV–vis and
EIS results support improved absorption and charge-transfer kinetics
as a result of the formed heterojunction. Interesting anomalies are
noted in the Mott–Schottky plot as anomalous behavior is noted
with respect to the conduction mechanism of the semiconductor, which
may be related to the formation of a charged layer on the surface.
Significant photocurrent at low applied bias implies greater efficiency
for the solar water splitting process and lower use of conventional
energy owing to low applied bias and paves the way for minimally energy-intensive
methods to produce chemical fuels. The photocurrent and efficiency
may be further enhanced by the optimization of nanostructure and the
maximization of active surface area by appropriate changes to the
synthesis parameters.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
All
chemicals were procured from Merck and
used in experiments as received. Deionized water (DI water, 18.2 MΩ
cm) was used in all experiments. FTO-coated glass substrates (sheet
resistance: 8 Ω/cm2) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and were used without any further modification.

Morphological,
Structural, and Optical Characterizations
Surface morphology
was determined using a Supra55 Zeiss field-emission
scanning electron microscope (FESEM). TEM and HAADF images were recorded
on a Tecnai-120 kV system. AFM analysis was carried out on a Nanosurf
EasyScan 2 instrument. The structural characterization was done by
employing a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer using monochromated
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å). The optical absorption
measurements were carried out using UV–vis spectrometer in
transmission mode (PerkinElmer, LAMBDA-35) in the wavelength range
of 320–800 nm.

PEC Measurements and Electrochemical Analysis
PEC measurements
were carried out in Autolab electrochemical workstation (PGSTAT 204
using NOVA software version 1.10) in a three-electrode configuration
using α-Fe2O3/CdS nanostructured films
on the FTO glass substrate as a working electrode, a Pt counter electrode,
and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (Scheme 2). An aqueous solution of 1 M NaOH with added
0.1 M Na2S (pH = 13) was used as the electrolyte to reduce
the possibility of recombination at surface trap states.37 These electrodes were mounted onto a specially
designed cell, and the active area of the electrode was fixed at 1
cm2. The simulated sunlight was provided by a xenon lamp
with an intensity of 1000 W/m2 under AM 1.5G spectrum.
The contact was made through the FTO, and the photocurrent was thus
measured. Current–voltage (I–V) curves were swept at 10 mV/s from −0.8 to 0.8
V versus Ag/AgCl (corresponding to a voltage range of 0.2–1.8
V versus RHE, as per conversion formula provided in Supporting Information). Mott–Schottky measurements
were performed using impedance measurements in the dark sweeping from
−0.8 to 0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl with 50 mV increments at 1590.5
Hz. The Nyquist plots were created from EIS measurements under illumination
at −0.4 V versus Ag/AgCl, which correspond to around 0.6 V
versus RHE using a s range of 1–100 000 Hz. The potential
of the Ag/AgCl reference electrode was found to be +480 mV with respect
to the ferrocyanide/ferrocenium couple.

by a Hydrothermal Method and Subsequent Growth of CdS
The
nanostructured hematite thin film was deposited directly on an FTO
glass substrate using a modified hydrothermal method.26 An aqueous solution (25 mL) containing FeCl3 (0.15 M) and NaNO3 (1 M) was sealed into a Teflon-lined
vessel, along with ethanol (1.25 mL). The vessel was put into an autoclave
and heated for 3 h at 98 °C. After the reaction, the yellowish
films of β-FeOOH formed on the FTO substrates were carefully
rinsed with DI water and transferred to a furnace. These samples were
subsequently annealed in ambient air at 550 °C for 1 h, resulting
in a reddish brown film of α-Fe2O3 converted
from β-FeOOH (yellow). Subsequently, the samples were treated
to CdS sensitization using a chemical bath method.22 Briefly, the as-prepared FTO substrates with the α-Fe2O3 thin film were dipped into 0.05 M Cd(NO3)2 ethanol solution for 1 min, rinsed with ethanol,
then dipped into 0.05 M Na2S methanol solution for 1 min,
and rinsed with methanol. Finally, the samples were washed with DI
water and dried at room temperature overnight.
