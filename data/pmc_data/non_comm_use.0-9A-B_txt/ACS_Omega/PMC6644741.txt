The conventional sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate
(NaDBS) has been
converted into an efficient and nontoxic anionic surface-active ionic
liquid, cholinium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (Cho[DBS]). We have investigated
its self-assembling behavior, interaction with the enzyme cellulase,
and ecotoxicity. The surface-active properties at the air–liquid
interface and the aggregation behavior of Cho[DBS] in water have been
determined using tensiometry, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC),
conductometry, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The enzyme activity
was observed using dinitro salicylic acid analysis. The enhanced enzyme
activity was explained through active-site exfoliation and structural
constancy of cellulase in the micellar medium using the results from
fluorescence, circular dichroism, DLS, and ITC. The nontoxic nature
was confirmed by toxicity analysis on the freshwater microalgae Scenedesmus sp.

1 Introduction
Ionic
liquids (ILs) are considered as nontoxic and greener solvents.1 Owing to their versatile properties, they find
applications in diverse fields of chemistry and biochemistry.2,3 In recent times, the conventional surfactants have been turned to
IL surfactants commonly called surface-active ILs (SAILs) to achieve
desired surface activity and dissolution in water. So far, most of
these surfactants have imidazolium and ammonium as a cation.4−6 They have exhibited superior surface activity, are also capable
of forming supramolecular nano- to giant aggregates viz., micelles,
vesicles, wormlike micelles, and multilayered vesicles, and have found
their uses in industrial, chemical, or pharmaceutical applications,7−16 but there are issues about their toxicities and biodegradabilities.
Therefore, the choice of a bioderived countercation (choline- and
amino acid-based) or counteranion (carboxylate and alkyl sulfate)
would create more opportunities to introduce biodegradability in IL
surfactants for wider practical utility.17,18 Moreover, the rise in concerns toward the toxicity of imidazolium-based
ILs has further furnished the demand for more biodegradable IL surfactants
for their efficient and biofriendly utilization.19−21 Seeking progress
in this direction, herein, we have turned the commercial anionic surfactant
sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate NaDBS to a more eco-friendly and biodegradable
surfactant “cholinium
dodecylbenzenesulfonate Cho[DBS]”. In brief, we have synthesized
Cho[DBS] as a potential nontoxic IL surfactant whose surface-active
properties were analyzed by using tensiometry, conductivity, and isothermal
titration calorimetry (ITC) and morphological/size analysis has been
done using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM).

Surface-active compounds find a wide range
of applications in micellar
catalysis, in DNA stability, in encapsulation of drugs, as a protein
stabilizer, and in enzyme/protein stabilization in detergent formulations.
Among these, the surfactant–protein interaction studies do
hold a great relevance if needed to be utilized for practical applications.22,23 Therefore, we have explored the stabilization of cellulase (an important
laundry enzyme) in micellar solution of Cho[DBS] for its suitability
in enzymatic catalysis, protein stabilizer, and biodetergents (enzymes
bearing detergents). So far, the enzymatic activities in direct micellar
systems have occasionally been investigated, and only a few reports
are there till date. It is assumed that organic substrates which have
limited solubility in water are localized in the palisade layer or
the hydrophobic core of the micelles, whereas the enzymes are dissolved
and stabilized in the continuous aqueous phase. These essentially
aqueous systems are more appropriate for potential industrial use
in enzymatic conversion than colloidal systems of the inverse type.24 The term micellar enzymology has been introduced
to investigate the kinetic properties of cytosolic enzymes in micellar
systems resembling to mimic biological environments.25 Surfactants in their monomeric or aggregated form can act
as potential crowding agents,26 and therefore
the presence of surfactants may lead to either the activation27,28 or deactivation29,30 of enzyme activity. Recently
in 2017, Mitra et al. demonstrated the five-fold α-chymotrypsin
enzyme activity enhancement in the micellar medium of dodecyltrimethylammonium
bromide (DTAB). They also investigated that DTAB does not produce
noticeable changes in the protein structure before the postmicellar
region.31 Verma et al. investigated the
α-chymotrypsin activity presence of novel cationic amine-based
gemini surfactants and observed the effect of the different spacers,
chain lengths, and head group sizes with the comparison of cationic
surfactants in aqueous buffer media.32 In
an earlier study on cellulase enzymes with SAILs, [C8mim][C12OSO3], we found that SAILs can provide the structural
and functional stability of the enzyme.33 Therefore, advancing the earlier studies, we have investigated here
the structural stability and functional enzyme activity of cellulase
and observed a significant enhancement in the activity of the enzyme
in Cho[DBS].

Protection of the environment and replacement of
toxic chemicals
are key points of current research. Therefore, the surfactant was
further subjected to toxicity analysis. The toxicity of Cho[DBS] in
an aquatic ecosystem was studied by applying on freshwater microalgae Scenedesmus sp. at high concentrations (1000 μmol
L–1). The nontoxic nature of Cho[DBS] also discloses
its practical use in laundry industry where NaDBS is a key player
in the detergent fixture.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Thermal Study of Cho[DBS]
The glass-transition
point of Cho[DBS] was determined from the differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) experiment (Figure 1A) and found near to 46 °C. According to the definition
of ILs, we can include it in the category of ILs,34 and because of its amphiphilic nature, it will be considered
as a SAIL. According to Kapustinskii eq S8 of Annexure 1, for inorganic ionic salts and can be applied on ILs
also, lattice enthalpy is decreased with an increase in the ionic
radius and leads to a markable decrease in the melting point.35 Depression in the melting point has been achieved
by the incorporation of asymmetric large organic cholinium cations
with the replacement of sodium cations. Here, the determination of
ionic radii is more difficult because of the nonsymmetrical structure
and smaller polarization effects of larger organic ions. In such compounds,
the structural effects such as branching or lengthening of substituent
tails will push down the melting point with the disruption of ideal
crystal packing.36

Figure 1 (A) DSC and (B) thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) profile of Cho[DBS].

Cho[DBS] has been synthesized as a nonhydrated stable low
melting
salt, and it is quite hygroscopic also. The Enthalpy of hydration
depends on the interaction of water molecules to the organic ionic
head8 and is much high for Cho[DBS] which
makes it hygroscopic. The presence of water molecules can also be
observed in TGA and NMR spectrum.

TGA analysis (Figure 1B) has been performed to evaluate
the decomposition temperatures
of Cho[DBS]. This IL surfactant starts to degrade at 264 °C and
undergoes rapid degradation at 352 °C, indicating a reasonably
good thermal stability.

2.2 Aggregation Behavior and
Interfacial Properties
of Cho[DBS] in Aqueous Medium
Surface tension (γ) has
been measured as a function of concentration of Cho[DBS] (Figure 2A) for the evaluation
of critical micelle concentration (CMC). Various parameters have also
been derived from surface tension measurements using concerned equations
(given in Annexure 1, Supporting Information) and are provided in Table 1. The CMC of Cho[DBS] in aqueous medium has been found around
2.2 mmol L–1 which is lower than that of its conventional
analogue NaDBS (Figure S4, 2.9 mmol L–1). Low CMC was observed because of the replacement
of a more hydrated Na+ ion with the less hydrated and hydrophobic
large organic cholinium counterion ([Cho]+). The latter
one is more effective in screening like-charge electrostatic repulsions
between surface-active anions at the air–water interface and
thereby more effective in decreasing the free energy of micellization.37

and
molar) profile of water with the function of Cho[DBS] (the inset shown

The measurements
were performed in triplicate independently. The mean value of each
measurement was given in the table. The errors (with two significant
numbers) were estimated from the deviation of values from their mean
for CMC and derived surface parameters.

Cho[DBS] has also shown lower CMC as compared to cholinium
dodecyl
carboxylate (25.5 mmol L–1)17 and cholinium dodecyl sulfate (6.0 mmol L–1)18 analogues because of a hydrophobic aromatic
benzene ring.37 It can be seen that sulfonate
groups have also reinforced the significant decrease in the CMC value
as compared to the carboxylates.17 From Table 1, it is observed that
the required surfactant concentration to reduce the surface γ
of the solvent by 20 mN·m–1 (C20) is 0.064 × 10–3 mol L–1, whereas this value for NaDBS is found near to 0.212 × 10–3 mol L–1 which is quite more than
that for Cho[DBS]. The value C20 is dominantly
controlled by van der Waals volume which further related to the size
of the cationic head group and interelectrostatic repulsions between
the head groups at the air–solution interface in low concentration
regimes.38 The CMC/C20 value which indicates the efficient performance toward the
selectivity for adsorption over micellization39 is very high (34.37) as compared to that of its sodium analogue
NaDBS (13.67). Other important parameters affecting the micellization
are the effectiveness of surface tension reduction, πCMC, and the adsorption efficacy pC20. From Table 1, the values of these
parameters are more near to those of its sodium analogue NaDBS. High
Γmax and low Amin (from Table 1), which signify the
efficient and compact packing of Cho[DBS] molecules at the air–solution
interface, are also on the higher side than those of its sodium analogue.40

The inflection points in the curves for
specific conductivity and
molar conductivity represent the CMCs for Cho[DBS] (Figure 2B) and NaDBS (Figure S5). The ratio between the post- and preslope in the
specific conductivity curve gives the degree of dissociation which
is further used to evaluate the counterion binding and Gibbs free
energy for the micellization process. In the molar conductivity curve,
there are no maxima found which indicates the absence of preaggregates
(aggregation below CMC). Thermodynamic parameters of aggregation,
such as counterion binding, Gibbs free energy of aggregation (ΔGmico), and the entropy of micellization (ΔSmico), are calculated
using well-known equations (Supporting Information). ITC experiment has been carried out to evaluate the thermodynamic
parameters and CMC determination at a constant temperature of 298.15
K. For the ITC experiment, a concentrated solution was added into
water and changes in enthalpy during the process were observed. Changes
in enthalpy as a function of surfactant concentration are shown in Figure 3A along with the
first-order differential curve.

Figure 3 (A) ITC enthalpogram and (B) DLS profile
of Cho[DBS] aggregation
in water.

The enthalpy of the dilution profile
can be explained by dividing
it into three regimes: (i) below CMC where endothermic enthalpy value
with constant changes leads to the dilution of micellar solution,
demicellization, and hydration of surfactant molecules, (ii) gradual
lowering in the endothermic enthalpy value at CMC leading to the reorganization
of micelles, and (iii) exothermic enthalpy value after CMC leading
to little changes in enthalpy due to less interaction between micelles
and attained constancy onward. The enthalpy of micellization ΔHmico has been determined from the difference of the (ii) to the (i) regime,
and accurate value of CMC has been determined from the first-order
differential curve where minima of the curve indicate the CMC value.
The summary of various thermodynamic parameters of micellization is
given in Table 2. A
negative value of ΔGmico indicates the favorable spontaneous
micellization of Cho[DBS] in water. The negative values of ΔHmico and the positive values of ΔSmico for micellization
collectively indicate the exothermic nature of micellization. A comparison
of interfacial and thermodynamic parameters of Cho[DBS] with those
of its analogue NaDBS reveals that there is no significant difference
in the surface properties and micellization behavior, from Table 2.

values from their mean for CMC and related thermodynamic parameters.

Size distribution (Figure 3B), TEM image (Figure 4), and autocorrelation
plot (Figure S6) of Cho[DBS] aggregates
at 5 mmol L–1 concentration
collectively indicate that the Cho[DBS] aggregates are assembled as
micelles with an average size of 2 nm and loose aggregates with an
average size of 26 nm. The micellar sizes of both Cho[DBS] and NaDBS
are nearly the same. Similar to Cho[DBS], NaDBS also forms micelles
of Rh ≈ 4 nm and loose aggregates
of Rh ≈ 100 nm at CMC and higher
centrations.37 As habitual, most of the
single long-chain surfactants and SAILs aggregate spontaneously into
micelles.

2.3 Functional
Activity of Cellulase in a Colloidal
Solution of Cho[DBS]
After investigating the surface activity
and aggregation behavior, micelles were subjected to a further application.
We looked into their effect (micelles of Cho[DBS]) on the structural
stability and functional enzyme activity of the cellulase enzyme and
excavated the potential utility of Cho[DBS] in enzymatic catalysis,
protein storage, and detergency. Dinitro salicylic acid (DNS) sugar
assay test has been applied to determine the functional activity of
cellulase at different concentrations of Cho[DBS]. The enzyme activity
profile of cellulase with Cho[DBS] concentrations is shown in Figure 5A,B. The absence
of sugar impurities in the purchased enzymes has been ensured by carrying
out blank DNS analysis in the absence of carboxymethyl cellulose.
The absence of dark brown color in vial label number 1 (Figure 5B) indicates the absence of
sugar impurities in cellulase. Rest of the vials (from 2 to 8) showing
dark brown color at different concentrations of Cho[DBS] indicate
that the enzyme is active in these colloidal solutions. Vial number
9 (absence of Cho[DBS]) served as a reference. From the enzyme activity
profile (Figure 5A),
it can be seen that the cellulase activity in surfactant solutions
is enhanced than in the absence of surfactants. The enzyme activity
increases from 0.2 to 1.5 mmol L–1 and has reached
its highest value at 2.4 mmol L–1. It further decreases
when moving to higher concentrations.

(mmol L–1) of Cho[DBS]. (B) Digital photographs
of vials where vial numbers
were mentioned at the top.

2.4 Plausible Mechanism for Enzyme Activity Enhancement
via Physical Interactions
After establishing the structural
stability and functional activity of cellulase, we looked into probable
reasons for these effects. The enhancement in the enzyme activity
compared to that in pure buffer or the absence of micelles is often
referred to as “superactivity.” The enhancement is governed
by several factors arising out of the heterogeneous environment created
by the surfactant molecules around the enzyme.41 The theoretical model has to be assigned on the belief
that the interaction between the micelle-bound enzyme and the substrate
plays the key role behind the superactivity. Activity enhancement
in the ionic surfactant-bound enzyme is probably the overall contribution
of electrostatic interactions with the charged interfaces and noncovalent
interactions with residues of proteins.42,43 However, there
is no exact mechanism prescribed, but protein conformational changes,
especially in the domain of active sites, are responsible for such
a superactivity.28 A sequential discussion
has been made by the results obtained from various complementary techniques.

2.4.1 Binding Enthalpogram for Cho[DBS] to Cellulase
Figure 6 shows the
enthalpogram of Cho[DBS] aggregation in the buffer and cellulase solution
and the binding behavior of the cellulase enzyme after subtraction
at 298.15 K. The aggregation process of Cho[DBS] in the buffer is
mostly endothermic and turned into exothermic after CMC (2.7 mmol
L–1).

Figure 6 ITC enthalpogram of Cho[DBS] aggregation in
the buffer (A) and
cellulase solution (B) and subtracted binding isotherm (B –
A) with the cellulase enzyme [right “Y axis”
represents the enthalpy of the actual binding isotherm (B –
A)].

Intermicellar interactions are
responsible for these exothermic
heat changes after micellization. The standard enthalpies of Cho[DBS]
aggregation in the buffer and cellulase solution were found to be
−2.64 and −1.96 kJ mol–1, respectively.
According to Otzen report on surfactant–protein chemistry,
the nature of heat changes can contribute to the electrostatic interaction
that leads to exothermic changes and the hydrophobic interaction that
relates to endothermic changes. After the subtraction of the Cho[DBS]
aggregation from the Cho[DBS] aggregation in 0.1% cellulase solution,
the actual enthalpy changes of Cho[DBS] binding to cellulase were
determined. The subtracted binding enthalpogram can be divided into
four regimes, that is, (i) from 0 to 0.53 mmol L–1 (C1) is the monomeric region, (ii) from
0.53 to 0.86 mmol L–1 (C1 → C2) is the aggregation region,
(iii) from 0.86 to 2.39 mmol L–1 (C1 → C3) is the micellar
region, and (iv) above 2.39 mmol L–1 (>C3) is the postmicellar region. In Figure 6, the constancy of the actual
binding isotherm
curve above 2.7 mM concentration of Cho[DBS] (>C3) indicates the stabilization of cellulase via hydrophobic
interactions.

2.4.2 Changes in the Tertiary
Structure of Cellulase
Variations in the intrinsic fluorescence
of cellulase have been
examined at various concentrations of Cho[DBS] at excitation (λex)/emission (λem) wavelengths of 280 nm/340
nm.44,45 Intrinsic fluorescence of cellulase appeared
because of the fluorophore Trp, Phe, and Tyr domains present in the
microenvironment of the protein. Cellulase absorbs ultraviolet light
around 280 and 230 nm because of the n−π* transitions
in aromatic amino acid residues and the π–π* transitions
in the protein backbone, respectively.33,46 The effect
coming from the absorption and emission of pure Cho[DBS] is negligible
as compared to cellulase. Changes in the fluorescence intensity are
indicated in Figure 7A. Initially, there is a slight decrease in the intensity up to the
monomeric concentration (C1), which indicates
the defolding of the tertiary structure and can state that the surfactant
started to disturb the protein structure. Electrostatic interactions
between Cho[DBS] and cellulase are likely to be responsible for such
a defolding.47 It is followed by a marked
increase in the intensity up to the aggregation concentration (C2). The increase in the fluorescence intensity
from C1 to C2 is mainly due to the refolding of cellulase.48 After C2, the fluorescence
intensity starts decreasing till CMC arrives which is due to the hydrophobic
environment. However, if we see it in overall perspective, the total
decrease in the fluorescence intensity is not more significant and
the intensity becomes constant after CMC. Therefore, it can be concluded
that the cellulase tertiary structure remains intact, even at CMC
and high concentrations, which further explores the stabilizing effect
of Cho[DBS] on the enzyme. In the postmicellar region, the Cho[DBS]
micelles interact very less with cellulase, leading to stabilization.

Figure 7 Variations
in (A) the intrinsic fluorescence and (B) ellipticity
of cellulase as a function of Cho[DBS] in mmol L–1.

2.4.3 Changes
in the Secondary Structure of Cellulase
After alterations
in the tertiary structure of cellulase, changes
in the secondary structure of the protein need to be observed. Therefore,
we have recorded far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra. The secondary
structure of cellulase is composed of α-helix, β-sheet,
and turn (Figure S1). The subunits of cellulase
are well-organized in their secondary structure, and it is found that
β-sheet and turn structures predominate in the N- and C-terminal
regions, whereas α-helices have scarce distribution along the
middle parts of cellulase.21,48,49 The CD spectra of native cellulase show a typical (α + β)
secondary structural conformation. The CD spectra to observe the changes
in the secondary structure of cellulase upon the addition of Cho[DBS]
are shown in Figure 7B. With the addition of Cho[DBS], the α + β conformation
remained intact up to 2.4 mmol L–1 concentration
of Cho[DBS] (near to CMC). Above 2.4 mmol L–1 concentration
of Cho[DBS], native CD band has been disturbed which is due to the
defolding of cellulase with alterations in ellipticity. That time,
active sites which are responsible for the enzyme activity have been
exposed. Thus, exposed active sites enhanced the enzyme activity concerning
the reference taken. The tertiary and secondary structure constancy
in the presence of Cho[DBS] indicates its stability (cellulase) in
between near and micelle concentration and vindicates its potential
candidature for a protein stabilizer.

2.4.4 Variations
in the Size of the Cellulase
Enzyme
To understand the concept of defolding–refolding
based on the protein hydrodynamic radius (Rh), we did DLS analysis of cellulase (0.1% (w/v)) as a function of
Cho[DBS]. The variations in Rh of cellulase
due to the unfolding and refolding of cellulase with the interaction
or complexation with Cho[DBS] are shown in Figure S7. Native cellulase has Rh of
2.06 nm33 where DLS of aqueous Cho[DBS]
at 5 mmol L–1 concentration showed 2 and 26 nm size
distribution. The DLS curve for cellulase–Cho[DBS] can be divided
into three regimes: (i) the monomeric regime (below C1, 0.53 mmol L–1) where an increase
in the size of cellulase is due to defolding, (ii) the micellar regime
(C2, 2.4 mmol L–1) where
the size of cellulase started to decrease because of refolding, and
(iii) the postmicellar pool (after 2.4 mmol L–1),
where the size became constant, indicating the stabilization of cellulase.
DLS measurements in support with fluorescence and CD confirmed that
cellulase is structurally stable in a colloidal solution of Cho[DBS].

2.5 Toxicological Evaluation of Cho[DBS] on Microalgae
Toxicity of surfactants (in this case, SAILs) on live cells is
influenced by certain structural properties of their monomeric cations
and anions, including the type of the ions, length of the attached
alkyl chains, size of cations, and presence and nature of functional
groups. Their aggregation behavior also influences the toxicity in
cells. Till now, only limited studies (mainly for carboxylate ILs)
are available about the effect of the alkyl chains in IL anions on
the toxicity of cells.50,51 The nontoxic nature of Cho[DBS]
was, therefore, examined by carrying out toxicological evaluation
on microalgae, freshwater strain Scenedesmus sp.20,52 The effects of Cho[DBS] on dead cells and
live cells of the freshwater microalgae are shown in Figure 8A,B.

Figure 8 (A) Number of live cells
and dead cells of the fresh microalgae
with various concentrations of Cho[DBS] at 72 h and (B) number of
live and dead cells of the fresh microalgae with the time interval
at 100 μM Cho[DBS].

The number of live cells of the freshwater microalgae in
0, 25,
50, 100, 500, and 1000 μM Cho[DBS] treatments was in the range
of 1.5 to 3.1 × 106 after 72 h of exposure, indicating
that a minimum number of dead cells (0.2 to 0.6 × 106) were produced when increasing the Cho[DBS] concentration. The effect
was also observed with the increase in the exposure time from 0 to
72 h (at 100 μM Cho[DBS]), with an increase in the number of
dead cells of the microalgae being countless (including natural death)
in comparison with live cells, as observed in Figure 8B.53 At the monomeric
concentration of Cho[DBS], a maximum number of live cells were unaffected
in the presence of SAILs, indicating that neither the cation nor the
anion part of SAILs produced any negative effect (negligible interaction
or less penetration through the bilayered lipid membrane) on the metabolite
rate of the microalgae.54 No toxic effect
induced by the nonamphiphilic cholinium cation is likely due to its
less interaction with the lipid membrane of the microalgae,55 whereas it has been shown that the amphiphilic
cations normally have greater interaction toward the cell membrane,
leading to higher toxicity.56 The literature
also indicates that small cations are more aggressive than larger
cations in inducing the toxicity when the anions are the same.57 Therefore, alkali cations (Na+ and
Li+) are more toxic to living cells than the ammonium cation
and the bigger cholinium cation ([Cho]+).

3 Conclusions
A potential nontoxic IL surfactant Cho[DBS]
was synthesized and
characterized. The study on its aggregation behavior indicates its
superior surface-active properties and low CMC value compare to those
of its competitor (NaDBS and other choline-based SAILs). An enhancement
in enzyme activity was observed in the presence of Cho[DBS], which
indicates that it showed excellent compatibility with cellulase. The
results show that Cho[DBS] interacts with cellulase through the electrostatic
and noncovalent interactions. The active sites of cellulase were exposed
in Cho[DBS] micellar solutions during the interaction, thus increased
its functional enzyme activity significantly. The slightly modified
structure of cellulase after the interaction with Cho[DBS] was stabilized
in the postmicellar regime. It is anticipated that the cholinium cation
is a strong chaotropic cation (a structure breaker)58 and hence provides stability to the enzyme, whereas the
Na+ cation is unable to provide such a stability to the
enzyme because of its kosmotropic nature.59 The nontoxic effect of Cho[DBS] examined on microalgae reveals its
excellent environmental friendly property and less toxicity for freshwater
microalgae (Synedesmus sp.). The study explores the use of nontoxic
Cho[DBS] in various colloidal applications. The stability of the cellulase
enzyme in combination with Cho[DBS] indicates its practical utility
for enzyme–detergent formulations.

4.2 Synthesis of Cholinium Dodecylbenzenesulfonate
Cho[DBS] has been synthesized according to the previously reported
procedure by our group.37,49 In brief, choline chloride
(5 g, 0.036 mol) and sodium 4-dodecylbenzenesulfonate (12.48 g, 0.036
mol) were dissolved in 50 mL of methanol and made to volume 250 mL
with DCM. The reaction mixture was kept overnight at constant stirring.
The precipitate was filtered through Whatman paper, and the DCM solution
was washed several times with Millipore water to extract the residual
inorganic impurities. Complete removal of residual NaCl salt was checked
by using alcoholic 0.1 M AgNO3 solution. After that, the
DCM solution of the product was treated with activated charcoal overnight
to remove color impurities. Suspended active charcoal was filtered
off through the Whatman paper. After completion of all processes,
the solvent was removed by vapor pressure distillation. The final
white waxy product (93% yield) was dried and stored in a vacuum oven
at 72 °C. CHNS analysis (theoretical values are in parentheses):
% C = 63.82 (64.30), % H = 9.91 (10.09), % N = 4.01 (3.26), % O =
14.52 (14.89), and % S = 7.01 (7.46). LCMS: ESI+m/z value = 104.13 for [C5H14NO]+ and ESI–m/z value = 325.50 for [C18H29O3S]−. The moisture analysis shows the
presence of water <200 ppm. The chloride content observed through
turbidity was less than 5 ppm. The 1H NMR (200 MHz) data,
NMR spectrum, and chemical structure of Cho[DBS] are given in the Supporting Information (Figures S2 and S3).

4.3 Methods
4.3.1 DSC and Thermal Gravimetric
Analysis
The glass-transition temperature (Tg)
of Cho[DBS] was determined from DSC measurements using a NETZSCH DSC
204F1 (Germany) thermal analyzer in a nitrogen atmosphere. The measurement
was performed between −100 and 150 °C at a heating rate
of 5 °C min–1. In a typical experiment, 2.41
mg of the sample taken in an alumina crucible was cooled to −100
°C using liquid nitrogen and maintained at −100 °C
for 2 min. After an isothermal treatment of 2 min, the crucible was
heated from −100 to 120 °C. An empty alumina crucible
has been taken as a reference during the measurement. The degradation
temperature (Td) was determined from a
NETZSCH TG 209F1 Libra TGA209F1D-0105-L thermal analyzer under a nitrogen
atmosphere. Cho[DBS] (10.6 mg) was placed in a crucible and kept at
25 °C. The temperature was increased from 25 to 700 °C at
a heating rate of 10 °C per min.

4.3.2 Surface
Tension Measurement from a Tensiometer
Surface tension measurements
were performed using an Attension
Force Sigma 700 tensiometer at 298.15 K. The Du Noüy ring method
was applied for all experiments, and the values were taken directly
from the provided software. Aliquots of Cho[DBS] stock solutions were
added to Millipore grade water by incremental volume, and the inbuilt
stirring was applied for about 5 min for complete homogenous solubilization
and kept for 10 min for equilibrium. The average data were collected
in triplicate with the accuracy within the limit of ±0.1 mN·m–1. The temperature of the sample cell was maintained
with an instrument-connected JULABO water thermostat in the limit
of ±0.1 °C error.

4.3.3 Conductometry
Specific conductivity
experiment was carried out with a Eutech digital conductivity meter
by applying unit cell constants. The temperature of the measurement
cell was controlled with a JULABO water thermostat to within ±0.1
°C. The conductivity was measured after each aliquot addition
of the Cho[DBS] stock solution to a sample containing Millipore water,
a conductivity cell, and a temperature probe. Experiments were performed
within a limit of an uncertainty <0.5%.

4.3.4 Isothermal
Titration Calorimetry
Calorimetric titration was done with
a MicroCal iTC200 microcalorimeter. The sample cell was
filled with 200 μL of
MQ water, 25 mM acetate buffer, and 0.1% cellulase solution according
to the experiment. The reference cell was filled with 200 μL
of 25 mM acetate buffer in all experiments related to cellulase where
MQ water was used for the aggregation study. Both cells were stabilized
at 298.15 K with a limit of ±0.001 °C. The Cho[DBS] stock
solution (40 μL) which was prepared in 25 mM acetate buffer
has been taken in an instrument-controlled Hamilton microsyringe injector.
The aliquot stock solution (2 μL) was added into the sample
cell containing 200 μL of acetate buffer and 0.1% cellulase
solution in 25 mM acetate buffer with continuous stirring (at 500
rpm). The other parameters such as time of addition, volume, and duration
between each addition were controlled by software provided with the
instrument. The enthalpy change at each injection was measured and
plotted against concentration by using MicroCal iTC200 analysis
with Origin software.

4.3.5 TEM and DLS
The micelles and loose
aggregates were digitally captured and investigated using a JEM-2100
transmission electron microscope at a working voltage of 200 kV at
GNDU, Amritsar, India. For TEM analysis, the sample was prepared in
MQ water, and a drop of the aqueous solution of Cho[DBS] was placed
on a Lacey-coated copper grid (300 mesh). The sample was dried in
a vacuum desiccator at room temperature for 24 h before the measurement.

DLS measurements were carried out at 298.15 K by using a NaBiTecSpectro-Size300
light scattering instrument (NaBiTec, Germany) with a source of a
He–Ne laser (633 nm, 4 mW). Cho[DBS] solutions (5 mmol L–1) were filtered directly into the quartz cell using
a membrane syringe filter of 0.45 μm pore size. The temperature
of the each measurement was controlled with an accuracy of ±0.1
°C. The data evaluation of the DLS measurements was performed
with the inbuilt CONTIN algorithm and replotted with Origin 8.5 software.
The error observed in the size of the micelles was ±1 nm.

4.3.6 DNS Sugar Assay Test for the Functional
Activity of Cellulase in a Colloidal Solution
A DNS sugar
assay test60 was applied to investigate
the functional activity of cellulase enzyme at different colloidal
concentrations (0, 0.26, 0.53, 0.88, 1.5, 2.74, 3.5, and 4.5 mmol
L–1) of Cho[DBS]. Carboxymethyl cellulose has been
used as the reference sugar substrate. For this analysis, 1% of cellulase
(100 μL) and 900 μL of carboxymethyl cellulose solutions
with different concentrations of Cho[DBS] were incubated for 20 min
at 45 °C. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 1 mL of
the DNS reagent. The reaction mixtures were boiled at 90 °C for
15 min in a water bath until the appearance of a deep red color which
is due to the nitro group-to-amino group reductive interconversion
by sugar released during the hydrolysis of carboxymethyl cellulose.
After that, 0.33 mL of a 40% solution of Rochelle salt (Na+ and K+ tartrate) was added to this mixture to stabilize
the deep red color. The solutions were cooled in a water bath and
diluted up to 10 mL. The optical density of each sample was measured
at a characteristic λmax of 546 nm. The measured
optical density was correlated with a predetermined standard calibration
curve (optical density against known glucose concentration) to calculate
the sugar concentration in each sample. The enzyme activity was calculated
using the standard eq S7 given in Annexure 1 of the Supporting Information.

4.3.7 Far-UV
CD Spectrometer
Successive
structural changes in the secondary structure (β-sheet) of cellulase
enzyme upon the interaction with Cho[DBS] were monitored through a
JASCO J-815 CD spectrometer with a controlled thermostat at 298.15
K in the far-UV spectrum (λ = 200–250 nm). The spectra
were collected in a 1 mm path length quartz cuvette at a scan rate
of 100 nm/min, and the sensitivity was set at 100 mdeg. The response
time and the bandwidth were 2 s and 0.2 nm, respectively. The smoothed
CD spectra were replotted against wavelength at different concentrations
of Cho[DBS] using the Origin 8.5 software.

4.3.8 Spectrofluorometer
for Fluorescence Study
Successive structural changes in the
tertiary structure of cellulase
enzyme upon the interaction with Cho[DBS] have been analyzed through
a Fluorolog (HORIBA Jobin Yvon) spectrofluorometer. Changes in the
intrinsic fluorescence of cellulase at various concentrations of Cho[DBS]
were analyzed with determining parameters such as excitation/emission
wavelengths (λex/λem) of 280 nm/340
nm, a slit width of 1 nm, and a path length of the quartz cuvette
of 1 cm. Each experiment has a repeat, and average maximal values
of these measurements have been considered. The smooth fluorescence
spectra were replotted against wavelength at different concentrations
of Cho[DBS] using the Origin 8.5 software.

4.3.9 Ecotoxicity
on Microalgae
The toxicity
of Cho[DBS] was evaluated on the selected strain of freshwater. The
freshwater strain Scenedesmus sp. was
grown in a BG-11 medium. The experiment was carried out in culture
tubes containing 15 mL of culture and Cho[DBS] at concentrations of
5, 25, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 μM. The culture without the addition
of Cho[DBS] served as a control. The tubes were incubated at 25 ±
1 °C under a light intensity of 150 μmol m–2 s–1, a light/dark period of 12:12 h, and a shaker
speed of 120 rpm. The algal cell viability was assessed every 24 h.
The culture (1 mL) was mixed with 20 μL of 1% (w/v) Evans blue
and incubated for 3 h. The cell count was performed using a Neubauer
chamber under a light microscope. Dead cells appeared blue as the
Evans blue solution diffused in the protoplasm region and stained
the cells blue.
