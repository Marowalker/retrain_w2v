The chemical hardness of adsorbents
is an important physicochemical
property in the process of adsorption based on the hard and soft acids
and bases (HSAB) theory. Tuning chemical hardness of adsorbents modulated
by their concomitants is a promising approach to enhance the adsorptive
capacity in principle. In the present work, we report an efficient
strategy that the adsorption capacity for aromatic sulfocompounds
can be enhanced by tuning the chemical hardness. This strategy is
first theoretically explored by introducing C element into the network
of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) based on a series of model materials
(model_xC, x = 1–5). Computational
results show that the chemical hardness is reduced after gradually
C-doping, which may lead to an enhancement of adsorption capacity
according to the HSAB theory. Then, a series of C-doped h-BN materials
(BCN-x, x = 10–50) were controlled
synthesized. All of the as-prepared materials show better adsorption
capacities (e.g., 27.43 mg g–1 for BCN-50) than
pure h-BN. Experiment results show that the adsorption capacity correlates
well with the C content in the BCN-x, which is consistent
with the results predicted by theoretical calculation. This strategy
may be helpful to rationally design highly efficient adsorbents in
separation engineering and may be expanded to similar two-dimensional
materials, where the π–π interaction is the dominant
driven force.

1 Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) layered materials are of particular interest
from both scientific and application viewpoints due to their unique
planar structures and properties.1−4 Recently, because of their possible applications
in separation science, some 2D layered materials (e.g., graphene,
hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), transition-metal dichalcogenides,
graphitic carbon nitride, and layered metal oxides) have attracted
considerable interests.5 Especially, hexagonal
boron nitride (h-BN), which owns unique properties compared with other
2D layered materials, such as wide-energy band gap,6 electrical insulation,7 and
chemical inertness,8 has been used as adsorbent,
catalyst, or other functional materials. As a graphene-like material,
h-BN shows good adsorption capacity for many adsorbates, including
CO2, organic dyes,9−11 antibiotics,12 oil,13,14 and sulfocompounds.8,15,16 Two possible physicochemical
properties are employed to interpret the adsorption capacity of h-BN.
One is that the unique polarity of BN bonds and the high surface area
of h-BN-related nanostructures provide good adsorption properties.3 The other is that the coexisted Lewis acidic
sites (B atom) and basic sites (N atom) can afford various types of
chemical interaction between h-BN and adsorbates. In recent years,
researchers have summarized that various 2D layered materials can
be built from B, C, and N elements in a specific stoichiometric ratio.17 It affords a wide space to modify these materials
for different applications. To date, most efforts are devoted to the
facile synthesis, energy storage, and photoredox catalysis.6,17,18 In this study, we report a rational
design of ternary C-doped h-BN materials (BCN) materials to enhance
the adsorption capacity for separation engineering.

It is well
known that sulfur removal from fuels is an important
topic for both chemical industry and environments.19,20 Sulfocompounds (especially aromatic sulfocompounds) in fuels are
difficult to be deeply removed by adsorption. To date, deep desulfurization from fuels by h-BN has still achieved
limited success despite its feasible modification in both morphology
and atomic structures, which promises a potential space to reach the
goal. Hence, how to rationally design highly efficient adsorbents
based on h-BN is a significant and attractive subject in petroleum
chemical industry. In principle, rational design of highly efficient
adsorbents should be based on a deep understanding of the adsorption
mechanism for BN-based materials. So far, π–π interaction
as a dominant driving force has been used to explain the mechanism
of aromatic adsorbate to layered graphene surface.10 As a graphene-like material, similar π–π
interaction may exist between h-BN and aromatic sulfocompounds. Chao
et al. suggested that virtual orbitals of B existed in h-BN, presenting
some Lewis acidity, which can serve as an electron acceptor. And the
adsorbate (gatifloxacin) has two aromatic rings, which can serve as
a π-electron donor.12 Besides, Xiong
et al. suggested that Lewis acid–base interaction plays an
important role in removing aromatic sulfocompounds from fuels.8 In addition, the mechanism of adsorption of aromatic
sulfocompounds is suggested to be π-complexation on other adsorbents,
such as Ag-Y and Cu-Y zeolites.21−24 Gao et al. considered that the adsorptive activity
of some metal compounds (such as AlCl3 and FeCl3) originates from their strong Lewis acidity and the sulfur basicity
of the sulfocompound, which leads to the acid–base complexation.25

These works also showed that the hard
and soft acids and bases
(HSAB) theory can serve as a fundamental tool to understand the adsorptive
strength of aromatic sulfocompounds. Moreover, our previous work also
suggests that the adsorptive selectivity correlates well with the
hardness of the sulfocompounds.26 Previous
works have reported that aromatic sulfocompounds (e.g., dibenzothiophene,
DBT) are soft Lewis bases.25,27−31 On the basis of the HSAB principle, it is known that hard acids
preferably interact with hard bases and soft acids preferably interact
with soft bases. Hence, for a specific sulfocompound (e.g., DBT in
this work), the softer the acidity of the adsorbent is, the stronger
they will be interacted and accordingly the higher may be the adsorption
capacity of the adsorbents. In addition, previous experiments have
shown that the energy level of molecular orbitals (directly related
to chemical hardness) for two-dimensional materials can be improved
by doping other types of atoms6,32 (such as C, N, O, etc.).
Here, we report that the adsorption capacity can be enhanced from
h-BN to BCN by tuning the chemical hardness via doping C element into
h-BN.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Chemical
Hardness and Frontier Orbitals of
BCN Materials
In this work, we first analyzed the frontier
orbitals and the chemical hardness for different C-content model BCN
materials (model_xC, x = 1–5)
by conceptual density functional theory (CDFT) (Figure S1, Supporting Information). In the model materials,
the C content increases with increasing x value,
which is used to simulate the trend of C-doping in real materials.
Computational results show that frontier orbitals (highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO))
are composed of π or anti-π orbitals for both pure h-BN
and model_xC (Figure 1). It is found that the bond lengths of C–B
in model_1C are generally longer than those of B–N (e.g., 1.529
Å for C–B and 1.455 Å for N–B, Figure S1). Besides, after gradually C-doping,
the bond lengths of C–B become slightly deformed, which ranges
from 1.484 to 1.567 Å. The N–B bonds remain almost unchanged
after C-doping as compared to the computational results. All of the
values of frontier orbitals, electronegativity, hardness, and energy
gap (for concepts definition, see Section 4.1) of model_xC are listed
in Table 1. According
to frontier orbital theory, HOMO is related to the donation ability,
whereas LUMO is related to the back-donation ability.28 From pure h-BN to model_5C, it can be seen that the energy
level of HOMO is elevated and the energy level of LUMO is declined,
which indicate a higher donation and back-donation ability, thereby
leading to a reduction of the band gap for these materials. Finally,
it can be observed that the hardness of the BCN is reduced. In addition,
the electronegativity was involved to confirm the acidity of the adsorbents.
All of the obtained values (χ > 0.10290 au or 2.8 eV) show
that
these adsorbents can be treated as Lewis acids.28,29 On the basis of the above discussion, we know that lower hardness
means higher adsorption strength. Hence, to enhance the adsorption
capacity, the carbon-doping strategy may be feasible from the insight
of DFT calculations and experimental facts.

BN, model_xC (x = 1–5). It
should be noted that the LUMO orbitals were selected
from LUMO + 3 (BN) and LUMO + 6 (model_1C) due to the turbulence of
molecular energy levels.

2.2 Structure and Morphology
of BCN
Motivated
by the above theoretical insights and experimental facts, a series
of BCN-x (x = 10–50, x is the amount of carbon resource vs boron acid) materials
have been synthesized . First, to characterize the structure of the
BCN, X-ray
diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra analyses
were carried out. Figure 2A reveals a typical hexagonal structure of BCN with two broadened
(002) and weak (100) peaks at 2θ = 25.2 and 42.6° (JCPDS
card no. 01-073-2095).6,18 The corresponding interlayer
distance of BCN-50 at 2θ = 25.2° is d =
3.51 Å, which is larger than the distance in boron nitride nanosheets
(BNNSs).33 The (100) peak, corresponding
to the distance between two adjacent rings (Figure 2D), becomes gradually less intense and shifted
to wide angle with increasing amount of carbon resource (Figure 2C). The corresponding
distance for commercial BN is 2.56 Å, whereas for BN and BCN-50,
it is reduced to 2.12 Å, which indicates disturbance of graphitic
structures, potentially by the C-doping effects.34 The FTIR spectra of BCN are much similar to those of h-BN,
as shown in Figure 2B. The absorption peaks at approximately 810 cm–1 belong to B–N–B out-of-plane bending vibration, whereas
the broad absorption bands at about 1375 cm–1 are
ascribed to the B–N in-plane stretching vibration,35,36 which indicates that the BCN still maintains the hexagonal structure
of h-BN. The absorption peaks of C–B or C–N bonds could
not be found in the BCN-x, which may be ascribed
to the typical overlap with B–N bands.6 Nonetheless, shifts of these two peaks were observed comparing with
h-BN, which indicates a little change of chemical bonding environment
around the bands, possibly influenced by the change of interlayer
interactions.

arrows corresponding to the (100) index of h-BN materials.

To prove that the carbon was indeed doped into
the h-BN graphitic
network in BCN materials, ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy (UV–vis DRS) was employed to analyze the excited
state and band gap. As shown in Figure 3a, both the absorption spectra of pristine BN and BCN-x have the same absorption peak at 245 nm, attributing to
the σ bond electron excitations of h-BN.37 It is noteworthy that there are distinct absorption peaks
at 328 nm of BCN-x.6 Furthermore,
the tail peaks in the visible region become stronger and stronger
as the amount of carbon resource increases in BCN-x. These phenomena are on account of the carbon doping in the h-BN
graphitic network and will be further confirmed by the following time-dependent
DFT (TD-DFT) calculations. Similar results can be observed in the
former papers.38−40 Hence, above results show that the introduction of
carbon could change the electron excitation and the HOMO–LUMO
status. This change can be also interpreted by color in macroscale
that the colors of BCN-x become darker and darker
(Figure S2). Furthermore, the change of
HOMO–LUMO can directly affect the band gap or other physicochemical
properties (e.g., hardness). It can be seen in Figure 3b that the indirect band gap values of BCN-x decrease gradually, thereby leading to a decrease of the
hardness of the related materials. To reach a deep understanding of
the new peak at 328 nm for BCN-x, UV–vis spectra
of BN and model_xC were calculated by TD-DFT, as
shown in Figure 3c.
Obvious red shift to high wavelength of the main excitation peaks
can be observed for these three BCN-xC model materials.
Moreover, strong absorption in the visible region from theoretical
computation also gives another evidence to confirm the C-doping effects
for h-BN. Above observations result in a reduced HOMO–LUMO
gap by doping C atoms into h-BN (Table 1). The reduced HOMO–LUMO gap allows the excitation
of electrons in a low energy range, thus leading to a red shift in
the UV–vis spectrum. Therefore, corresponding hardness of BCN-x could also follow the same trend, which gives the direct
evidence to prove that the introduction of carbon can reduce the hardness
of BN, from UV–vis spectra. The calculated results of hardness
are shown in Figure 3d, which agree well with the experimental results.

the (F(R)·E)2 vs E plots; (c) UV–vis spectra

Element mapping of BCN-50 (Figure 4a–c) gave
a uniform distribution of B, C, and
N throughout the whole selected area, proving homogeneity of the ternary
BCN material. To further confirm the chemical environment of all elements,
we carried out electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements
on the K-edge absorption for B, C, and N. The EEL spectrum of the
BCN-50 in Figure 4d
clearly shows the K-shell ionization edges at about 190, 284, and
401 eV for B, C, and N, respectively. The two peaks at each core-edge
fine structure is the characteristic of the sp2-hybridization
state, corresponding to π* and θ* bands, respectively.41−43 Thereby it indicates that B, C, and N are in a commonly sp2-hybridized, 2D-conjugated electron system, rather than a physical
mixture. Above experimental as well as theoretical discussions give
direct evidences that the HOMO–LUMO gap (or chemical hardness)
can be tuned by forming different BCN-x samples and
thus may finally change the adsorption capacity of BCN-x (see Section 2.4).

EEL spectrum of BCN-50.

For the morphology, the transmission electron microscopy
(TEM)
and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the BCN-x are depicted in Figure 5, which gives significant information of morphology and microstructure.
From the SEM images, both BN and BCN-x keep the nanosheet
structure. The nanosheets of BCN-x are fragmented
and show the “water plant” structure with increasing
amount of carbon resource (Figures S3 and S4). This observation has been further testified by TEM. It can be
seen in BCN-10 (Figure S4a) that there
are some holes with different pore size contributing to the fragmentation
of nanosheets. These holes will reduce the periodic boundary of the
graphitic rings and thus lead to a reduced intensity of (100) plane,
as depicted in Figure 2. Then, the nanosheets obviously and regularly fragment into lathy
water plant structure in BCN-40 (Figure 5b). Before BCN-40, the cetyltrimethylammonium
chloride (CTAC) does not act as template until the concentration is
up to critical micelle concentration.

BCN-40.

2.3 Carbon
Content of BCN
X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) was used to further investigate the chemical composition
of BCN comparing with h-BN. As shown in Figure 6a, both BN and BCN have B, N, C, and O elements.
The peak of C 1s in BCN-50 is visibly stronger than BN because the
content of C in BCN is increased. By calculating from the XPS survey
spectrum, the atomic concentrations of B, C, N, and O in BN and BCN-50
are listed in Figure 6d. It can be seen that the contents of both boron and nitride in
BCN-50 decrease comparing with BN, whereas their carbon content increases
from 12.4 to 23.3%, which reaches close to an ideal stoichiometry
of BCN. In addition, other BCN samples show the same trends for atomic
concentrations (Table S1). Elemental analysis
of other BCN-x samples (Figure S5) revealed that the carbon content is gradually increased
with increasing amounts of CTAC. The BN also contains 12.4% carbon
due to the synthetic method without removing the adventitious graphitic
carbon on the surface and the adsorbed carbon dioxide. From the deconvolution
of the C 1s spectrum of BN in Figure 6b, evidence can be given that there are two subpeaks
centered at 284.7 and 288.3 eV, which correspond to C–C (graphitic
carbon) and C–O (CO2) components, respectively.18,42 The corresponding C 1s spectrum of BCN-50 shown in Figure 6c can be deconvoluted into
four subpeaks. In addition to the two same subpeaks in BN, the binding
energy of 285.5 eV was ascribed to the C–N bond and that of
283.7 eV was assigned to the C–B bond,18,42,44,45 which suggest
that the carbon atoms indeed substitute partial B and N atoms. Apart
from these, it is interesting to find that the percentage of C bonded
to B is higher than that of C bonded to N species. Accordingly, above
results show that the content of nitride decreases more quick compared
with the amount of boron. To give an insight into this phenomenon,
a substitution model based on DFT was constructed (see Section 4.1). The substitution
energy was employed to judge whether B or N is easier to be substituted
by C atom. The calculated results show that the substitution energy
of B is 40.2 kcal mol–1, whereas that of N is 80.3
kcal mol–1. Although the substitution reactions
of both B and N are endothermic, the substitution energy of N is much
higher than that of B. Hence, we suggest that the N atoms in h-BN
are easier to be substituted by C atoms. In this study, the highest
carbon content of BCN reaches to 23.3%, which is similar to previous
C-doping works.6,41,42,46,47

1s of BCN-50, and (d) atomic concentrations of B, C, and N in BN and

2.4 Adsorption
Performance of BCN
In
the following, to verify the performance of adsorption capacity by
tuning the chemical hardness, the removal of DBT in model oil by adsorption
was tested. The data of adsorption experiment are shown in Section 4.2. The corresponding
adsorption capacities of BCN-x are depicted in Figure 7a. It can be seen
that the BCN materials show higher adsorption capacity than pristine
h-BN. With respect to the BCN-x sample, the adsorption
performance is enhanced when the amount of carbon resource increased
from 10 to 50% (i.e., carbon content: 12.4–23.3%, Table S1). BCN-50 has the highest adsorption
capacity (27.43 mg g–1), which is much higher than
the pristine h-BN and commercial BN (Figure 7a). In the former work, to demonstrate the
synergistic effect of C-doping and the porous structure of BN, the
individual C-doping was also investigated using glucose as the carbon
source instead of IL. It can be found that the C-doping leads to some
improvement in adsorption.38 In addition,
it now seems that when more carbon atoms are doped into the graphitic
network of h-BN, the materials will show higher adsorption capacity
for DBT. The higher adsorption capacity of the current BN sample compared
to commercial BN may be ascribed to the higher concentration of C,
which also shows that the carbon can enhance the adsorption capacity.
In general, adsorbents with larger surface areas can lead to higher
adsorption performance. This is usually correct because the materials
with larger surface areas will expose more adsorption sites to interact
with adsorbate. On the contrary, the BCN-x sample
shows lesser surface area (BCN-50: 160 m2 g–1) than pristine h-BN (772 m2 g–1) in
this work, as measured by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
analysis (Figure S6 and Table S2), which
may be due to the effect of carbon introduction. Similar results can
be seen in the former papers. It indicates that the surface area is
not the dominant effect for adsorption capacity in the current systems.
However, we found that the hardness can explain the structure activity
relationship. As depicted in Figure 3d, the values of hardness for model_xC decrease with increasing amount of carbon atoms. Accordingly, it
is quite obvious that the lower hardness the adsorbent exhibits, the
higher adsorption capacity the adsorbent shows. For an adsorbent with
Lewis acidity, the approach to reduce its hardness is beneficial to
enhance its adsorption capacity for aromatic sulfocompounds with Lewis
basicity (e.g., DBT). In terms of HSAB theory, the Lewis acid (BCN)
can interact with the Lewis base (DBT) to form a Lewis acid–base
complex. The soft acid can have strong complexation with the soft
base, especially. It is difficult to change the property of DBT in
oil phase, but changing the property of adsorbent is possible. Doping
carbon atoms into the graphitic network of h-BN can reduce the whole
hardness, which is useful to enhance the adsorption capacity of DBT.

conditions: m (adsorbent) = 0.05 g; V (oil) = 20 mL; T = 298 K; Cs (oil) = 300 ppm. (b) Stable configurations and adsorption

K. (d) Effect of temperature by BCN-50. Experimental conditions: m (adsorbent) = 0.05 g; V (model oil) =
20 mL; Cs (oil) = 300 ppm.

To investigate the effect of temperature, the adsorption
of DBT
on BCN-50 was studied at different temperatures (298, 318, and 338
K). The results are presented in Figure 7d and show that the adsorption capacity decreased
with increasing temperature. It is proved that the adsorption process
is exothermic. Thus, 298 K is in favor of adsorptive desulfurization.
The adsorptive desulfurization of BCN-x under various
initial sulfur concentrations was also conducted and presented in Figure 7c. The adsorption
capacity increases with increasing initial sulfur concentration, which
shows that more efficient adsorption of DBT on BCN samples can be
obtained at high concentration. In addition, reaction kinetic analysis
shows that it fits well with the pseudo-second-order kinetics (Figure S7 and Table S3), which is consistent
with previous works in similar systems.8

2.5 Adsorption Mechanism
Although the
HSAB theory can be used to explain the activity of adsorption, the
essence of adsorption between adsorbate and adsorbent molecule cannot
be described iconically and directly. Therefore, adsorption models
of BN_DBT and model_xC_DBT were built and the adsorption
energies were calculated by DFT method to further analyze the difference
between BN and BCN. It can be seen in Figure 7b that the distance between the plane of
DBT and BN (or BCN_5C) is about 3.22 Å (or 3.24 Å), which
is a typical length for π–π interactions. The calculated
adsorption energy for the BN_DBT system is −20.12 kcal mol–1, which clearly shows a strong interaction between
BN and DBT. The adsorption energy of BCN_5C_DBT is up to −75.70
kcal mol–1, which is much higher than that of BN
and thus shows an enhancing adsorption capacity by C-doping effect.
This stronger interaction has been reported in previous works, named
pancake bond.48 In addition, other model_xC_DBT systems show the same trend of the adsorption energies
(Table S4). These DFT results give direct
evidence that the adsorption capacity of h-BN can be enhanced by C-doping.

3 Conclusions
In brief, an efficient strategy
can be used to enhance the adsorption
capacity by introducing C element into h-BN materials. First, frontier
orbitals, electronegativity, chemical hardness, and energy gap were
examined by CDFT. Results show that the HOMO–LUMO gap and the
chemical hardness are reduced after the C atoms are doped into the
graphitic network of h-BN. XRD, FTIR, UV–vis DRS, XPS, and
EELS technologies show that the C element is successfully doped into
the BCN-x materials. The as-prepared BCN-x materials show better adsorption capacity (e.g., 27.43
mg g–1 for BCN-50) than the commercial h-BN. It
is found that the adsorption capacity correlates well with the C content
in the BCN-x, which is consistent with the results
predicted by theoretical calculation. The enhancement of the adsorption
capacity is ascribed to the reduction of the HOMO–LUMO gap
and the chemical hardness after C-doping, which was confirmed by UV–vis
spectra and theoretical calculations. Hence, we propose that the enhancement
of adsorption capacity can be correlated to the reducing of the chemical
hardness, from h-BN to BCN by C-doping strategy. This strategy may
be expanded to other similar adsorptive systems, where the π–π
interaction is the dominant driven force.

4 Methods
4.1 Computational Details
For adsorption
systems, there are various types of noncovalent interactions, such
as induction, electrostatic, and dispersion interactions. Traditional
hybrid functionals, like B3LYP, can give reasonable results for the
systems that mainly consist of induction and electrostatic interactions.
However, they are not good enough for the systems in which dispersion
interaction is dominant. Hence, the Minnesota functional (M06-2X)
was implemented in this work because of its good performance on noncovalent
systems. In addition, 6-311+G(2d) basis set was used for all of the
calculations. Geometry optimization and energy calculations were all
performed using the Gaussian 09 suite of programs. For the model of
h-BN, a cluster model, which contains 52 atoms (B21N21H16), was employed. This model contains 12 aromatic
rings, which should be big enough to study the adsorption of DBT (three
aromatic rings). In addition, similar models have been widely used
to model properties of h-BN. The C-doped h-BN models were constructed
by gradually dispersing C atoms into the h-BN network, resulting in
five cluster models, such as B21CN20H16, B21C2N19H16, B21C3N18H16, B21C4N17H16, and B21C5N16H16. For the stabilities of these
BCN materials, frequency calculations were performed and no imaginary
frequencies were found, which means all of the related model materials
are stable.

4.1.1 Substitution Energy
To consider
the doping effect on h-BN, a substitution model was constructed by
substituting boron/nitride atom with carbon atom. The former study
shows that B, C, and N can substitute with each other and form various
new structures due to their similar atomic parameters. However, which
atom will be substituted, the B atom or N atom? This question is meaningful
for understanding the formation mechanism of BCN. Herein, the concept
of substitution energy was adopted to quantitatively analyze which
atom will be substituted by the C atoms. Equation 1 shows the definition of the substitution
energy (Es) 1  where EBCN and EBN are
the total energies of BN with and without
substitution, respectively, Esub is the
energy of the substituted atom (boron or nitride), EC is the energy of carbon atom. The energies of the substituted
atom (boron, carbon, or nitride) were calculated in the single atomic
state. The electronic configurations are B (2s22p1), C(2s22p2), and N(2s22p3), which correspond to spin multiplicities of 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
Their calculated energies are −24.6485, −37.8406, and
−54.5846 au, respectively.

4.1.2 Conceptual
Density Functional Theory (CDFT)
CDFT is using DFT descriptors
to provide qualitative insights and
to quantify intuitive chemical concepts.49,50 Commonly used concepts in CDFT are ionization energy (I), electron affinity (A), hardness (η), electronegativity
(χ), and so on. Hardness means the resistance of the chemical
potential to change in the number of electrons. In Table 1, the values of ionization energy
and electron affinity are omitted because they equal −εHOMO and −εLUMO. The corresponding
operational definition of hardness is the finite difference formula 2  or approximation through Koopman’s
theorem 3  showing hardness is also
due to the HOMO–LUMO
gap. This gap can describe the ability of electron transition. Generally
speaking, if the HOMO–LUMO gap is less than 3.0 eV, the material
would have absorption in the visible region. Electronegativity is
defined as follows  where E is the ground-state
energy, ρ(r) is the electronic density, N is the total electron number. There exist practical routes
to estimate chemical potential in quantitative DFT calculations. According
to Mulliken  

4.2 Experimental Details
4.2.1 Materials
Boric acid, urea, cetyltrimethylammonium
chloride (CTAC), and n-octane were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Co. Ltd. DBT was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

4.2.2 Synthesis of Adsorbents
In a typical
synthetic procedure, carbon-doped boron nitride nanosheets were synthesized.
Boric acid and urea with the molar ratio of 1:4 were dissolved in
20 mL of methyl alcohol. Then, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride as
carbon source was added into the solution and stirred. The mixture
was heated at 60 °C until the solvent evaporated completely.
The obtained white solid was ground a little. Then, the powder was
calcined at 1000 °C for 2 h in N2 atmosphere in a
tube furnace. The obtained products were marked as C/BN. Moreover,
the boron nitride nanosheets were similarly prepared without CTAC
and marked as BNNSs.6

4.2.3 Measurements
Fourier transform
infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Model Nexus 470 FTIR instrument
using KBr disk at room temperature. XRD spectra were recorded on a
Bruker D8 diffractometer with high-intensity Cu Kα (λ
= 1.54 Å). Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
measurements were carried out with a field-emission scanning electron
microscope (JEOL JSM-7001F). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
images were recorded on a JEOL-JEM-2010 microscope (JEOL, Japan) operating
at 200 kV. EELS spectrum was recorded on EDAX FP9761/70 by FEI TECNAI
G2 F20 S-TWIN. UV–vis spectra were recorded on an UV-2450 spectrophotometer
(Shimadzu Corporation, Japan). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
was performed on a VG MultiLab 2000 spectrometer using Mg KR (1253.6
eV) radiation. BET surface area and pore volume were obtained from
77 K N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms using a
TriStar II 3020 (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation).

4.2.4 Adsorption Process
The model oil
used for experiments was prepared by dissolving DBT in n-octane, and
the concentrations of sulfur were 100, 300, 500, and 800 ppm. In a
typical adsorptive desulfurization experiment, 0.05 g of adsorbent
was added to 20 mL of model oil in a 50 mL conical flask. Then, the
flask was fixed in a shaker with a water bath maintained at a temperature
of 298 K and agitated for 120 min.

4.2.5 Analysis
Methods
The residual sulfur
concentration in model oil after the adsorption was analyzed by a
gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) with tetradecane
as the internal standard (Agilent 7890A; HP-5, 30 m × 0.32 mm
i.d. × 0.25 mm; FID: Agilent). The adsorbed amount (qt) of sulfur compounds was calculated by the following
equation  where C0 and Ct (mg L–1) are the initial
sulfur concentration and the sulfur concentration at time t, respectively, V (L) is the volume of
the oil, and m (g) is the mass of the adsorbent.
