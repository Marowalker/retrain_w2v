Bubbles in DNA are
involved in many important biological processes.
In this work, a coarse-grained model is used for characterizing bubbles
formed in DNA melting. The model resorts only to electrostatic interactions
at the Debye–Hückel level, in combination with a short-ranged
attractive interaction within a base pair. In spite of also omitting
atomistic details, the model is able to capture experimentally established
trends in persistence length and radius of gyration. By applying it
on different systems, it is possible to conclude that there is a minimum
size for stable bubbles, in the interval between 12 and 20 bp, which
agrees well with previously published experimental findings. Simulated
scattering data distinguishes between different bubbles and detects
conformational changes in the melting process. Therefore, SAXS is
regarded as useful for bubble formation studies, while simulations
provide a molecular understanding.

1 Introduction
Accessing the genetic
code is fundamental to important biological
processes such as transcription and replication. It requires local
openings of the DNA helix such that bubbles are formed. In cells,
proteins are involved in this process, although DNA properties like
the stability of the different conformations and the properties of
the bubbles also play a substantial role. This process can, for example,
be studied by thermal denaturation of DNA (melting).

DNA melting
is an entropy-driven process, where there is a transition
from a rigid double-stranded (ds) state to a much more flexible single-stranded
(ss) state, i.e., the entropy gain overrules the attractive hydrogen
bonds. The adenine–thymine (A–T) pair and the guanine–cytocine
(G–C) pair involve two and three hydrogen bonds, respectively.
Hence, the melting and the formation of bubbles depend on the sequence,
and the process generally starts in A–T-rich regions.

There are several factors that influence the melting process, for
example, pH,1 ionic strength,2,3 DNA concentration,4,5 and DNA characteristics such as
composition,2,3 base sequence,6 and length.5,7 Experimentally, DNA melting can
be studied by UV spectroscopy because disruption of base stacking
leads to an increase in absorption. Another commonly used technique
is calorimetry because it provides the enthalpy change associated
with melting. Both of these methods measure the fraction of open base
pairs, f. However, with the mentioned standard methods,
no information regarding the fraction of completely separated molecules, p, is obtained. The latter can, for example, be accessed
for special sequences using a quenching procedure,8 whereas small-angle scattering of X-rays or neutrons can
be used for the determination of p for any sequence.9 The combined knowledge of f and p provides information about the intermediate states in
melting, such as the average relative bubble length.10,11 Our results presented in this article will be compared to the experimental
findings of Zeng et al.10,11

There are many
available theoretical models for studying DNA properties
and melting, varying in their level of detail; from statistical Poland
and Sheraga models12−14 and thermodynamic nearest-neighbor models15 to atomistic models.16−18 Due to the
time required for atomistic simulations, melting studies are restricted
to short oligonucleotides.19 For this reason,
there is a large number of coarse-grained models, such as a two-site
model by Drukker et al.,20 the three-sites-per-nucleotide
model (3SPN),21−25 and oxDNA, where each rigid nucleotide is composed of four interaction
sites.26−28 The mesoscopic Peyrard–Bishop–Dauxios
model29,30 has reproduced experimental observations
of bubble stability.31

In this work,
a coarse-grained model for characterizing the bubbles
formed in DNA melting is presented, with the purpose of understanding
bubble formation on the molecular level. Here, electrostatic interactions
on the Debye–Hückel level are used in combination with
a short-ranged attractive interaction within a base pair. Even though
it is a gross model and omits atomistic details, it gives new physical
insight into bubble formation in DNA melting and the factors influencing
it.

2 Theoretical Methods
2.1 Model
The structural properties of
one dsDNA molecule with monovalent counterions have been studied using
a simple model, in which electrostatic interactions at the Debye–Hückel
level are used in combination with a short-ranged attractive interaction
within a base pair. Positively charged hard spheres represent the
counterions, whereas the solvent enters the system Hamiltonian only
through its permittivity. Additional salt is treated implicitly. The
molecule is constructed by two strands, where each strand is described
as a chain of hard negatively charged spheres, connected by harmonic
bonds. To represent the hydrogen bonds, which keep the strands together,
a short-ranged attractive interaction was applied between complementary
nucleotides. Each strand contains four bead types: two that correspond
to the A–T pair and two that correspond to the G–C pair.
The two bead types representing a pair are not distinguishable; hence,
no difference is made between A and T nucleotides, and analogously,
there is no difference between G and C nucleotides. This implies that
within this model a GCGG sequence is identical to a CGGC sequence.
Due to modeling purposes, a sequence of only one pair type is constructed
by alternating the two bead types; hence, other beads of the same
type in close proximity are not expected to contribute to the total
short-ranged attractive interaction. For a schematic description of
the model, see Figure 1. The radius of the sphere corresponding to a nucleotide was set
to 2 Å to give a realistic representation of the electrostatic
interactions. Notice that this value is not expected to correspond
to the actual excluded volume effect of a nucleotide. All particles
were enclosed in a spherical cell with hard walls in an attempt to
mimic the cell environment.

Grouping of the atoms
for an adenine nucleotide. (b) Model of an oligonucleotide with the
following sequence: four G–C pairs (beads with the two darkest
shades), three A–T pairs (the two brightest shades), and four
G–C pairs. Each bead has the charge −e. The arrows describe the attractive interactions, which are 3/2
times stronger for G–C pairs than A–T pairs. The attraction
is applied only between beads of the same shade. The attractions represented
by dashed arrows, presented only for the A–T block, are negligible
for all beads due to the steep decay of the potential.

All interactions are assumed to be pairwise additive,
and the system
Hamiltonian has five contributions, according to 1  The hard sphere potential, Uhs, is given
by 2  where the summation extends over all strand
beads and ions. Here, rij is the center-to-center distance between particles with indices i and j, and uijhs represents the hard sphere potential between two particles, according
to 3  where Ri is the radius of particle i. The
electrostatic
potential energy, Uel, is calculated as 4  where the summation extends over all particles
in the system. Zi is
the valency of particle i, e is
the elementary charge, and κ = [2NAIe2/(ε0εrkBT)]1/2,
where NA is the Avogadro constant and I is the ionic strength. ε0 refers to the
vacuum permittivity, and εr refers to the relative
permittivity for water (78.4 at 298 K), which is assumed in this study
to be temperature-independent.

The bond energy, Ubond, and the angular
energy, Uangle, presented below, apply
only to the strands 5   6  In eqs 5 and 6, Nseg corresponds to the number of segments (beads) in the
strand, kbond is the force constant =
0.4 N/m, and ri,i+1 is the
center-to-center distance between two connected segments, having the
equilibrium separation r0 = 5 Å.
The angular force constant kang = 8.6
× 10–24 J/deg2, and αi is the angle formed by the vectors ri+1 – ri and ri–1 – ri from three consecutive segments, with the equilibrium angle α0 = 180°.

The hydrogen bonds are modeled as a short-ranged
attraction with
a 1/r9 decay 7  which is sufficient
for our purposes. Here,
ε determines the interaction strength. The energy at closest
contact (4 Å) is 24.4 and 16.2 kJ/mol for each base pair, which
corresponds to 9.8 and 6.5 kT, respectively. The attraction is applied
only between beads of the same type.

To mimic and induce bubble
formation in dsDNA, different triblock
sequences have been investigated, with each sequence having G–C
pairs in the ends of the molecule and a central block of A–T
pairs (see Figure 1).

2.2 Systems
The structural and conformational
changes of the dsDNA upon melting, as well as the effect of the bubble
size, have been studied by using a model consisting of 48 bp, confined
to a spherical cell of radius 150 Å, including counterions. The
cell radius was approximately 2.5 times larger than the radius of
gyration in the associated state, and increasing the cell radius did
not affect the radius of gyration. Five different middle block lengths,
presented in Table 1, were studied, and the simulations were performed with 150 mM implicit
salt to mimic physiological conditions. The B20 sequence, i.e., a
dsDNA molecule consisting of a middle block of 20 base pairs and two
end blocks of 14 base pairs each, was regarded as the reference system.
Hence, this system was also simulated at 50 and 10 mM salt to investigate
the effect of ionic strength.

is 48 bp in all systems. The number of base pairs in each block is
given by the G–C:A–T:G–C block length, and NAT/Ntot is the number
of A–T pairs divided by the total number of base pairs. The
reference system is marked in bold.

Although the sequences presented in Table 1 are not very common experimentally,
the
systems were chosen to enable a systematic study of the effect of
block length. However, they bear resemblance to the sequences in the
experimental study by Zeng et al.10,11

2.3 Simulation Details
The equilibrium
properties of the model systems were obtained by employing Monte Carlo
simulations in the canonical ensemble according to the Metropolis
algorithm,32 using the simulation package
MOLSIM, version 4.0.8.33 All particles
were confined in a spherical cell with hard boundaries, and the simulations
were initiated in a state of completely associated DNA strands. Hence,
all nucleotides are involved in base pairs. After an equilibration
run, typically 1 × 107 trial moves/particle, where
the strands reached a typical configuration for the system, a production
run was performed. The latter was divided into sub-batches sufficiently
long for achieving convergence of all properties of interest, between
2 × 107 and 6.6 × 108 trial moves/particle.
More specifically, the criteria of converged base pair properties
required the observation of approximately symmetric distributions
of base pairing over the whole strand, and the radius of gyration
should display a distribution close to Gaussian and a stable average
value.

The strands were subjected to four types of trial displacements:
(i) translation of a single bead, (ii) slithering, (iii) pivot rotation,
and (iv) translation of an entire chain. In the slithering move, a
randomly selected end bead is moved to a random position within the
bond length of the other end and thereafter the segments are shifted
such that the sequence order is not changed. In the pivot rotation,
the shorter end of the chain is rotated around a randomly selected
bond. The rotational angle was uniformly sampled between −90
and 90°. The selection among the trial moves was made randomly
using the weights 0.85, 0.05, 0.05, and 0.05, respectively. The values
of the translation parameters were set to keep the acceptance rate
around 30%.

2.4 Analyses
Melting
curves are represented
as the average number of base pairs as a function of temperature.
A geometrical definition of base pairing has been applied such that
two nucleotides of different strands were defined to be in contact
and form a base pair if their center-to-center distance was within
6 Å. Different values of the contact distance have been evaluated,
and it was evident that the melting curve was not very sensitive to
the exact value of the cutoff distance. Additionally, the average
contact probability has been analyzed. Furthermore, the average distance
within native base pairs has also been analyzed.

The strand
stiffness was determined by the persistence length lp. The calculation was based on the projection of angles
between bond vectors 8  where ⟨Rbb2⟩1/2 is the root-mean-squared bead–bead separation and
α
= π – θ1, where θ1 is
the first directional angle, further described by Akinchina and Linse.34

The effect of melting on the structural
and the conformational
properties was studied by calculating the radius of gyration of each
strand 9  Here, Rg is the
radius of gyration and ⟨···⟩ refers to
an ensemble average, whereas N is the number of beads
of the strand and rcom corresponds to the
center of mass. The radius of gyration was also determined from simulated
scattering data by employing the Guinier approximation.

Reported
uncertainties of the simulated quantities are one standard
deviation of the mean, estimated from the deviation among the means
of the subdivisions of the total simulation, according to 10  Here, ⟨x⟩s is the average of x from one
subdivision,
⟨x⟩ is the average of x from the total simulation, and ns is
the number of subdivisions.

Scattering profiles and pair distance
distribution functions, P(r), were
evaluated from the simulations.
At temperatures where the strands were associated, the scattering
curves were calculated by taking into account both strands. Hence,
the P(r) includes all distances
within and between the strands.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Characterization of Reference
System
System B20, with a total length of 48 bp and a 20
bp block of A–T
nucleotides in the middle, was used as the reference system. The melting
curve in Figure 2 shows
that the process occurs in two steps: (i) opening of the weaker A–T
pairs, which induces a stable bubble (see snapshots in Figure 2), and (ii) opening of G–C
pairs, which causes a full separation of the two strands. Such stepwise
melting is often difficult to capture with UV absorption measurements,35 but it has been observed for DNA molecules with
a length of several thousands of base pairs.36 However, such behavior has been found for shorter molecules10,11 when calculating the average fractional length of the bubble from
UV absorption experiments. In the simulations performed in this study,
the end separation and the complete strand separation are negligible
at temperatures up to the highest plateau temperature, proving that
the base pair separations observed in this study originate from the
middle block. Hence, up to that temperature, the fraction of open
base pairs is directly comparable to the average fractional length
of the bubble.

Figure 2 Melting curve for B20, depicted as the average number
of base pairs, Nbp, versus temperature, T.
Representative snapshots at 273, 343, and 410 K are included, with
counterions excluded for clarity.

Figure 3 shows
that
the persistence length (lp) decreases
as a function of temperature. More drastic changes in stiffness are
induced at the same temperatures as the melting, indicating that the
strand separation indeed results in a decreased lp; hence, it is not solely a temperature effect. This
originates in an energy penalty for bending when the strands are associated,
making the strands more rigid than in the separated state. This can
be ascribed to an increased electrostatic persistence component. However,
in reality, the helical structure of dsDNA makes the difference in lp much larger, cf. lp ≈ 22 Å for ssDNA37 and lp ≈ 500 Å for dsDNA.38 In spite of not including helicity, the model
still captures an almost 40% change in lp due to melting. Melting is also associated with a decrease in radius
of gyration (Rg) of approximately 20%
for the individual strands (Figure 3). Regarding Rg, the decrease
is more drastic in the first melting step than in the second.

and radius of gyration, Rg, both normalized

the eye. Right axis: Melting curve expressed as the probability of
base pairing, Pbp, versus T. Uncertainty, expressed as one standard deviation of the mean, is
also included.

Simulated scattering
intensity functions, I(q), at three
different temperatures for the B20 system are
presented in Figure 4a. The lowest temperature corresponds to completely associated strands,
whereas at the intermediate temperature, a bubble is present. At the
highest temperature studied, the strands are completely separated;
hence, the scattering curve corresponds to one ssDNA. The featureless
scattering pattern exhibited at all temperatures is typical for flexible
polymers that can be in many different conformations. The I(q) of the lowest temperature decays more
rapidly at low q compared to the I(q) at higher temperatures, in agreement with a
larger Rg. The Rg determined from the Guinier approximation is in good agreement
with values calculated directly from simulations (eq 9), although it is slightly smaller
(6%).

representation for sequence B20 at temperatures corresponding to fully
associated strands, a bubble state, and complete separation. (c) Pair
distance distribution function at 273 and 343 K.

The unitless Kratky representation (Figure 4b) provides information on the overall conformational
state. For a rigid rod, (qRg)2I(q) increases linearly with q, whereas for a Gaussian chain, it initially increases
and then reaches a plateau value. dsDNA behaves almost like a rigid
rod at low temperatures, whereas with increased temperature, the flexibility
increases and the behavior becomes more like a Gaussian chain. Hence,
the analysis captures the decrease in persistence length. The extra
bend on the curve at the bubble temperature is due to the induced
regions with different flexibility, as the connected end blocks are
more rigid than the middle part. The bubble also gives rise to a peak
in P(r), which is visible when comparing
the curves corresponding to fully associated strands and a bubble
in Figure 4c. The high,
narrow peaks at short distances correspond to highly repeated distances
between beads, such as the bonds between the nearest neighbors. The
contraction of the strands corresponding to a smaller Rg at higher temperatures is also detectable in P(r), as longer pair distances become less
probable with increased temperature.

It is generally established
that the melting temperature increases
with increased ionic strength,2,3 mainly due to screening
reducing the repulsive electrostatic interactions between the backbones
of the strands. The melting curves for the reference system with 10,
50, and 150 mM monovalent salt follow this trend (see Figure 5). Notice also that the temperature
interval for melting is smaller when the ionic strength is lower.
Since the model captures these experimentally established trends despite
its simplicity, it shows the importance of the interplay between electrostatic
repulsion and hydrogen bonding.

10, 50, and 150 mM salt,
depicted as the average number of base pairs, Nbp, versus temperature, T.

3.2 Effect of Middle Block
Length on Bubble Properties
Five systems with different lengths
of the A–T middle block
have been studied to capture the melting behavior and the effect of
bubble stability. For the two shortest middle blocks, i.e., 6 and
12 bp, no plateaus are detected in the melting curve, which indicates
that the fraction of separated base pairs increases very slowly with
temperature until complete separation starts (see Figure 6). The plateau appears for
the sequences with a middle block length ≥ 20 bp, and with
increasing middle block length, the plateau decreases in size, which
is in agreement with experimental studies.11,39 This implies that when the A–T block fraction increases the
melting curve approaches the behavior of homogeneous sequences, which
melt in a single step. As expected,2,3 the melting
temperature shifts toward lower temperatures as the A–T content
increases.

Figure 6 Melting curves for the five systems with different middle block
lengths, shown as the fraction of open base pairs, fsep, versus temperature, T. The total
length is 48 bp, and the length of the bubble forming A–T middle
block is given by B.

Figure 7a
displays
the average probability of base pair separation as a function of the
segment number. Here, it is shown that bubbles are always present
at the plateau temperatures if the middle block length is between
20 and 28 bp, i.e., Psep = 1 for A–T
pairs and Psep = 0 for G–C pairs.
For the sequence with only six A–T pairs, the bubble is more
often closed than opened because the probability of separation is
less than 50%. Simultaneously, Psep in
the ends has increased to approximately 20%, indicating that fraying
might occur even before the bubble is completely established. The
experimental procedure described in references (8), (10), and (11) is not able to distinguish
between fraying and bubbles, which makes it evident that simulations
can provide additional information. The Psep analysis suggests that bubbles of the size ≤ 12 bp are not
stable because Psep < 1, which is in
agreement with the conclusion in reference (11), i.e., that there is a minimum length for a
stable bubble on the order of 20 bp. For the largest A–T block,
36 bp, Psep > 0.1 in the end blocks.
This
shows that complete separation occurs and hence the bubble is not
stable at the plateau temperature. The G–C end clamping regions
appears too short to prevent complete separation; thus, the bubble
is not stable. It is therefore possible that the stable bubble size
is dependent on the length of the G–C clamping regions. The
average separation within native base pairs, presented in Figure 7b, shows that as
the length of the middle block increases, the bubble size increases,
since a larger A–T fraction allows for larger separation within
base pairs. Data for system B36 is not shown due to the complete separation
of the strands.

Figure 7 (a) Probability of base pair separation, Psep, versus segment number, N, for the
systems
B6 (bubble forming A–T block length B = 6), B12, B20, B28,
and B36 at their plateau temperatures (398, 383, 343, 323, and 298
K, respectively). (b) Average base pair separation, rbp, versus segment number, N, for systems
B6, B12, B20, and B28 at the same temperatures.

The I(q) for the four smallest
bubbles (data not shown) as well as their radii of gyration determined
from the Guinier approximation appear very similar. The unitless Kratky
representation (Figure 8a) is in agreement with the earlier conclusion, i.e., that a larger
fraction of open base pairs corresponds to a higher flexibility because
the flexibility increases with increased bubble size. The small unstable
bubble systems, i.e., B6 and B12, show the same behavior as fully
associated dsDNA (cf. Figure 4). The other bubbles exhibit a bend and less steep slope,
corresponding to higher flexibility, as larger parts of the strands
are not base paired.

intensities for the systems with different lengths of the bubble forming
A–T middle block: B6, B12, B20, and B28 at their plateau temperatures
(398, 383, 343, and 323 K, respectively). (b) Pair distance distribution
function for the stable bubble systems B20 and B28 at their plateau
temperatures.

The P(r) for the stable bubbles
shows a shift in peak position toward larger pair distances when the
bubble size increases (Figure 8b); hence, P(r) analysis
can distinguish between bubbles of different sizes. An experimental
study showed that SAXS can be used for obtaining the fraction of completely
separated molecules.9 Hence, in combination
with another technique for obtaining the fraction of open base pairs,
such as regular UV spectroscopy, the average bubble length can be
extracted for sequences known to form bubbles, according to references (8), (10), and (11). This opens up for experimental
studies of bubbles in sequences that do not form hairpins, which was
a restriction of the procedure described in references (8), (10), and (11). Additionally, our simulated
scattering data suggests that SAXS can also provide information on
bubble size and flexibility changes.

4 Conclusions
We have presented a coarse-grained model for DNA melting, in which
only a few relevant variables are imposed. We have shown that the
model is able to qualitatively capture experimentally established
trends in lp and Rg, as well as effects of ionic strength and composition. Applying
the model on systems with different sequences, it provided information
about the bubble formation in melting. It was concluded that there
is a minimum size for stable bubbles somewhere between 12 and 20 bp,
which agrees well with experimental observations.11

Furthermore, it is shown that simulated scattering
data distinguishes
between different bubble sizes and that it can detect overall conformational
changes. As has been shown experimentally,9I(0) can provide information about the fraction
of completely separated molecules, which also opens up for studies
of bubble length. For these reasons, SAXS can be useful in studying
bubbles in DNA. However, for obtaining more information about the
bubble stability and its dimensions, simulations are important because
they provide a molecular understanding.

Future studies of interest
include, for example, separation at
one end of the molecule as well as simulations of longer molecules
to be able to compare with experimental SAXS data.
