A rapid
fluorescent probe based on the conjugate of chromone and
benzothiazole moiety was presented, which could selectively respond
to HSO3– over other common anions and
thiols. The function of the probe relies on nucleophilic addition
to break down the π-conjugation. The probe can be used as a
signal tool to determine HSO3– levels
in sugar-based food and living cells.

Introduction
Recently,
anion chemosensors have attracted significant interest
due to their crucial role in a wide range of chemical, biological,
and environmental processes.1−7 Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is one of the most largely distributed
air pollutants, and it has been investigated extensively in toxicology.
Sulfur dioxide is associated with asthma, chronic bronchitis, morbidity,
and mortality increase in old people and infants. It also causes breathing
difficulty,8 lung cancer, cardiovascular
diseases, and neurological disorders.9 Inhaled
SO2 is easily hydrated to release sulfite (SO32–) and bisulfite (HSO3–) in 3:1 M/M (neutral fluid),10 and the
toxicity of SO2 is due to these two anions. Bisulfite is
considered as an essential preservative for several foods, beverages,
and pharmaceutical products for preventing oxidation and bacterial
growth, and enzymatic reactions during production and storage.11−13 Despite its valuable properties, bisulfites have harmful effects
on tissue, cells, and bio-macromolecules. It can cause visible damage
such as necrosis, inhibit cell division, and induce micronucleus,
which often lead to the death of a cell.14,15 Thus, because of its toxicity, the development of a rapid, sensitive,
selective, low cost, and smart detection method for the lethal bisulfite
pollutant is of significant importance.

A number of conventional
analytical techniques for developing colorimetric
and fluorimetric bisulfite-based sensors have been reported, such
as spectrophotometry,16,17 spectrofluorimetry,18 chemiluminescence measurements,19,20 phosphorimetry,21 chromatography,22 and electrochemistry.23,24 But, these methods require troublesome sample pretreatment, specific
reagent preparation, a lot of time, and complicated instrumentation.
In addition, some of them are not sensitive enough to determine very
low concentrations of HSO3–. On the other
hand, fluorescence spectroscopy has been widely used in sensors due
to its high sensitivity with less consumption, operational simplicity,
real time monitoring, better selectivity, as well as good reproducibility.
In recent years, chemodosimetric reactions such as the Michael addition,25−29 selective reactions with aldehyde or levulinate,30−34 coordinative interactions,35,36 and those involving a noncovalent indicator displacement assay37,38 have been applied for specific HSO3– sensing. Recently, some ratiometric fluorescent chemodosimeters
have been reported for bisulfite sensing, which can afford a built-in
correction for environmental effects.39−45 A few groups have developed fluorescent sensors for the rapid detection
of HSO3–. Tian et al.46 and Feng et al.47 have reported
bisulfite probes for rapid detection. But, their probes are applicable
only in half water conditions, and they displayed a long response
time (>5 min). Thus, it is very important to develop a good, water
soluble, rapid, highly selective, and sensitive probe for bisulfite
anion.

In this work, we designed a good water soluble chromone-benzothiazole
dye (CBD, Scheme 1),
which is fast-responding, highly sensitive, and selective for the
detection of SO2 derivatives. This receptor (CBD) undergoes
a nonreversible chemical change with HSO3–, resulting in colorimetric and fluorescent dual responses. Because
of the nucleophilic nature of HSO3–,
we have developed a reaction-based receptor for HSO3– to avoid the complication due to induced hydrogen
bonding. The nucleophilic attack of HSO3– toward this type of dye would interrupt the π-conjugation
and block the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process. This new
HSO3– probe is promising because of its
very fast response toward the pollutant (HSO3–), attractive sensing property, and it is easy to synthesize. To
prove the feasibility of our probe, we used it for quantitative detection
of bisulfate in food samples and living cells.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Routes
for CBD Receptor
The synthesis of the receptor CBD is depicted in Scheme 1. Precursor 1,3-benzothiazol-2-yl-acetonitrile
(1)48 was prepared through
a cyclization reaction between o-amino-thiophenol
and malononitrile in the presence of acetic acid (eq 1, Scheme 1). C–O coupled cyclization
with formylation of 2-acetyl-p-cresol was performed
using dimethylformamide (DMF)–POCl3 to obtain 3-formyl-6-methylchromone
(2, eq 2).49 Piperidine-mediated
condensation of 1,3-benzothiazol-2-yl-acetonitrile (1) with 3-formyl-6-methylchromone (2) furnished the receptor
CBD (eq 3). The structure of the new compound (CBD) was confirmed
by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR), and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) analyses.

Results
and Discussion
To understand the selective and sensitive
behavior of the probe,
absorption was carried out in a CH3CN–H2O solution (1:9, v/v, 10 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), pH 7.4) with various
anions such as HSO3–, CN–, F–, Cl–, Br–, I–, AcO–, SCN–, SH–, N3–, S2–, HSO4–, PPi, and Pi
(Figure S1a, SI). CBD exhibited an absorption
peak at 471 nm, which slightly blue shifted (471–467 nm) upon
addition of HSO3–, and the blue shifting
was gradually increased upon addition of HSO3–. This result clearly indicates that the π-conjugation between
aromatic heterocycle 1 and 2 of CBD was
destroyed. As a consequence, the yellow-colored solution become colorless,
and this could be observed easily by the naked eye (Figure S1a, inset, SI). Thus, nucleophilic addition of HSO3– to the vinyl linkage of the probe interrupts
the ICT process and furnishes a new nonconjugated CBD–SO3H adduct. The absorbance at 471 nm changed by almost 21-fold
(from 0.0016 to 0.033) in the presence of HSO3– (Figure S1b, SI). In contrast, the addition
of other anions resulted in negligible responses (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Variation of absorbance
for probe CBD in a CH3CN–H2O solution
(1:9, v/v, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) in the presence
of various anions.

After obtaining good
results in absorption spectra, we were interested
in studying the fluorescence spectra with this probe. As displayed
in Figure 2a, the CBD
chemodosimeter exhibited very weak fluorescence bands centered at
530 nm (Φ = 0.001) upon excitation at 460 nm in the absence
of HSO3– or in the presence of other
anions, namely, CN–, F–, Cl–, Br–, I–, AcO–, SCN–, SH–, N3–, S2–, HSO4–, PPi, and Pi. Only a drastic change was observed
when bisulfite was added to the solution of the chemodosimeter.

emission spectra of CBD (c =
2.0 × 10–5 M) with HSO3– (c = 2.0 × 10–6 M) at pH
7.4 in CH3CN–H2O (1:9, v/v) [gradual
addition of 1 equiv of HSO3–, respectively]
(λex = 460 nm); the inset shows the naked eye fluorescence
change of CBD with addition of HSO3–.
(b) Fluorescence change at 530 nm of CBD upon gradual addition of
HSO3–.

In the fluorescent spectra, the peak intensity at 530 nm
gradually
increased and a new peak appeared at 570 nm (Φ = 0.16). When
HSO3– was gradually added to the solution
of the CBD, the nonfluorescent solution exhibited green fluorescence
(Figure 2a, inset).
The emission intensity of the probe at 530 nm showed a drastic change
from 9.87 to 610.86 (62-fold) in the presence of bisulfite (Figure 2b). To test the selective
nature of CBD toward HSO3–, we investigated
the effect of important physiological anions such as CN–, F–, Cl–, Br–, I–, AcO–, SCN–, SH–, N3–, S2–, HSO4–, PPi, and Pi.
Only the nucleophile CN– induced a little change
in the fluorescence intensity (Figure 3a). The competition experiments clearly suggested that
the probe CBD is not affected by interference from the other anions
(Figure 3b). CBD displayed
remarkable selectivity toward HSO3– over
other anions, which might make it suitable for precise HSO3– detection in complex samples. Because SO2 can be endogenously generated in cells during oxidation of
H2S or sulfur containing amino acids, a promising HSO3– probe should have high selectivity for
HSO3– over other reactive sulfur species
such as H2S, Phen, Gly, Cys, Hcy, and GSH. From Figure S2, it is clear that our probe is highly
selective toward HSO3– over these sulfur
compounds.

Figure 3 (a) Fluorescence response of CBD (2.0 × 10–5 M) toward various anions (1 equiv) at pH 7.4 in CH3CN–H2O (1:9, v/v). (b) The fluorescence intensity of CBD (2.0 ×
10–5 M) toward HSO3– (1 equiv) containing 10 equiv of various anions (λex = 460 nm).

From the calibration
curve (Figure S3, SI), the limit of detection
(LOD) was calculated by using the formula K × Sb1/S,50 where Sb1 is the standard deviation
of blank measurements and S is the slope of the calibration
curve. The limit of detection of
CBD for HSO3– is 0.45 μM, which
is significantly low for the detection of HSO3– found in many chemical systems. Wang et al.51 reported a probe for bisulfite in which fluorescence recovery is
possible in the presence of various reactive oxygen species (ROS).
In the case of our probe, nonreversible fast sensing occurred in the
presence of various ROS species (Figure S6).

From the time-dependent fluorescence spectra, it was found
that
CBD behaves as a very fast probe toward the bisulfite ion. The reaction
was completed in less than 1 min with a rate constant of 22.1 ×
10–2 s–1. This result strongly
suggests that CBD is a highly reactive probe toward bisulfite ions
(Figures 4a and S4, SI). The fluorescence lifetime of CBD with
and without bisulfate ion was detected by time resolved fluorescent
spectra (Figure 4b).
The fluorescence decay curves of the compounds were fitted by utilizing
monoexponential functions (SI). The radiative
rate constant kr and the total nonradiative
rate constant knr of CBD and the CBD–SO3H adduct were calculated according to the equation ′I–1 = kr + knr, where kr = ϕf/′I.52 For CBD, ′I = 2.20 ns,
and for the CBD–SO3H adduct, ′I = 10.91 ns.

40, (7) 50, and (8) 60 s] (λex = 460 nm). (b) Fluorescence
decay curves for CBD and CBD–SO3H adduct in CH3CN.

1H NMR and
HR-MS studies were carried out for CBD and
the CBD–SO3H adduct to analyze the reaction mechanism.
From 1H NMR spectra, we can see that the vinyl protons
at 7.859 ppm of CBD disappeared and new upfield signals appeared at
5.257 ppm after reaction with HSO3–.
The signals of the aromatic protons were slightly upfield shifted.
The appearance of a new symbolic peak at 5.257 ppm for this receptor
confirms the nucleophilic addition of HSO3– to the vinyl π-bond (Scheme 2). From the mass spectra, CBD showed a main peak at
345.0664 before addition of NaHSO3, which corresponds to
the [CBD + H]+ species. After addition of NaHSO3, a peak appeared at 449.0746, which exactly matched with the adduct
species [(CBD + HSO3– + H+) + Na].

Scheme 2 Proposed Mechanism for Sensing Bisulfite by CBD Receptor
Next, we were interested in
determining bisulfite by using our
probe in the solid state (using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates).
This is an important experiment because we see the sensing of bisulfite
with our probe without using any instrumental analyses. To perform
this experiment, we prepared TLC plates by immersing the plates into
the solution of CBD (2 × 10–4 M) in CH3CN and drying the plates in air (Figure 5.1). Next, this TLC plate was immersed in
a solution of HSO3– and photographs were
taken under ambient and UV light (Figure 5.2). This experiment proves that we can easily
and instantly detect HSO3– qualitatively
by the naked eye.

Figure 5 Color changes on test paper with (1) CBD and (2) CBD in
the presence
of NaHSO3.

Our CBD probe could also be used for the measurement of bisulfite
in granulated sugar. For this purpose, we prepared a sample solution
by dissolving 10 g of sugar in water. Then, this solution was diluted
with water to 50 mL. From the data in Table 1, we see that our probe is able to determine
bisulfite content in the sugar sample. So, this probe can easily be
used to measure bisulfite level in food samples.

CBD is an excellent intracellular probe for detecting
HSO3– due to its permeability as well
as stability. Figure 6a depicts the bioimaging
of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by CBD, when there
is no added HSO3– from the outside. Here,
cells show no significant fluorescence. Figure 6b–f shows increasing green fluorescence
with enhanced concentration of HSO3– from
5 to 25 μM. Cell viability is represented in Figure S5 (SI), where up to 60 μM/L concentrations of
CBD show around 61.957% viable cells, which predicts that this is
a safe probe to use in a biological system. We used 30 μM/L
CBD solutions for imaging, which shows a fairly high number of viable
cells (78.066%). This confirms the nontoxic nature of the new receptor
(CBD).

nm fluorescence emission; (a) no added HSO3–, (b–f) with 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 μM HSO3–, respectively.

Conclusions
We have introduced a smart fluorescent probe
for detection of HSO3– in real and biological
samples. The method
employs the nucleophilic addition of HSO3– to the conjugated double bond of the receptor to block the π-conjugation
between the heterocyclic aromatic skeletons. The proposed probe shows
rapid (<1 min) and excellent selectivity toward bisulfite over
other common anions and biothiols. Thus, we believe that this design
concept will find important application and leads the way for further
development for detecting SO2 derivatives in biological
systems.

Experimental Section
General Methods
All materials were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Chemicals Private Limited and were used without further purification. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Brucker
300 MHz instruments. CDCl3 was used as solvent with tetramethylsilane
as an internal standard. Chemical shifts are expressed in δ
units and coupling constants in Hz. Melting points were determined
on a hot-plate melting point apparatus in an open-mouth capillary
and were uncorrected. UV–vis titration experiments were performed
on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 750 spectrophotometer and fluorescence experiments
were done using a Perkin Elmer LS 55 with a fluorescence cell of 10
mm path. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a JASCO FT/IR-460 plus spectrometer,
using KBr disks. Column chromatography was carried out by using silica
gel 60 (60–120 mesh).

General Method of UV–Vis and Fluorescence
Titrations
For UV–vis and fluorescence titrations,
a stock solution
of the probe was prepared (c = 2 × 10–5 ML–1) in CH3CN/H2O (1:9,
v/v). The solutions of the guest anions and biothiols were prepared
(2 × 10–4 ML–1) in CH3CN/H2O (1:9, v/v) at pH 7.4 by using 10 mM HEPES
buffer. The solution of the sensor was prepared by an appropriate
dilution technique. The spectra of these solutions were recorded by
UV–vis and fluorescence methods. All solvents were purchased
from domestic suppliers and were used after distillation.
