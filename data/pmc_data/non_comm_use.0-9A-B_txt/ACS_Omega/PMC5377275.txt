Regulation of the ubiquitin–proteasome
system (UPS) to treat
select types of cancer has become a popular area of drug discovery
research. The FDA approval of proteasome inhibitors Bortezomib and
Carfilzomib in the treatment of multiple myeloma has led to an increased
need for chemical reporters capable of detecting and quantifying protein
ubiquitination and the activity of members of the UPS including E3
ubiquitin ligases and the proteasome in the tumor cells of the patients.
One limitation of peptide-based reporters is their rapid degradation
in the cellular environment by cytosolic peptidases. Conversely, β-hairpin
“protectides” exhibit a pronounced secondary structure
that significantly increases their lifetime under cellular conditions.
The goal of this work was to develop a family of novel, ornithine-rich
protectides that could act as primary degrons serving as substrates
for in vitro ubiquitination. The fluorescent peptide-based reporters
were demonstrated to be highly resistant to degradation in multiple
myeloma cell lysates. The most stable β-hairpin primary degron,
containing a single ornithine residue at the N-terminus, OWRWR [Ac-OWVRVpGO(FAM)WIRQ-NH2], demonstrated rapid ubiquitination kinetics and a 20-fold
increase in stability when compared with an unstructured primary degron.
A screen of E1 and E3 enzyme inhibitors in cell lysates showed that
ubiquitination of OWRWR was significantly impaired by inhibitors of
the SCF family of E3 ligases. Furthermore, this is the first report
demonstrating the use of an ornithine residue on a primary degron
as a ubiquitination site. This study serves as a strong foundation
for the development of stable, fluorescent, peptide-based reporters
capable of quantifying protein ubiquitination and the enzymatic activity
of members of the UPS.

Introduction
Regulation of cellular
homeostasis, migration, and division is
accomplished via a continuous cycle of protein expression, posttranslational
modification, and degradation.1 Degradation
of misfolded or inactivated proteins is primarily accomplished by
proteasome-mediated degradation, which requires the posttranslational
addition of a polyubiquitin chain to a target protein. Ubiquitin is
a small 76 amino acid globular protein whose attachment and removal
from target proteins is governed by a large family of enzymes collectively
referred to as the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS).2 Polyubiquitination is the result of a cascade
of enzymes culminating in the formation of an isopeptide bond between
the C-terminal carboxylate of an incoming ubiquitin and the ε-amino
group of a lysine residue on the target protein; however, ubiquitin
has been observed to be conjugated to other amino acids including
cysteine, serine, or threonine.3 Protein
ubiquitination starts with an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme forming
a high energy thioester bond with free ubiquitin, which is recognized
and transferred to an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Next, an E3
ubiquitin ligase forms a complex with the E2 enzyme to mediate the
transfer of ubiquitin to the target protein. The E3 ligase recognizes
and binds to a specific amino acid degradation sequence or degron.
These degrons, normally in close proximity to an ubiquitin-accepting
lysine residue, impart specificity to protein degradation because
each E3 binds to a subset of degrons. The large number of E3 ligases
(>600 in humans) permits recognition of a wide variety of degrons
including phosphodegrons, oxygen-dependent degrons, and N-terminal
degrons.4 Although it is well-established
that degron-mediated ubiquitination of proteins leads to proteasomal
degradation, the role of protein monoubiquitination versus polyubiquitination
is still unclear. Recent work by Shabek et al. demonstrated that proteins
consisting of ∼150 residues required only a single ubiquitin
moiety to target them to the proteasome for degradation.5 Although initially the term degron was applied
to a sequence that was responsible for both ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated
degradation, a recent study by Guharoy et al.6 expanded this definition of a degron to include three essential
components for ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation by the proteasome.
The primary degron is a specific sequence of amino acids recognized
by an E3 ubiquitin ligase, the secondary degron is a proximal ubiquitination
site lysine, and the tertiary degron is an unstructured sequence at
least 20–30 amino acids long and is responsible for the initiation
of proteasomal degradation. All three components are necessary for
proteasome-mediated degradation; however, a primary degron with a
ubiquitination site offers the potential to serve as a reporter for
ubiquitination and E3 ligase activity alone.

Regulating proteasome
expression and function has become a popular
target of drug discovery research in the treatment of cancer, neurodegenerative
disease, and cardiac disease.7 The success
of the proteasome inhibitors Bortezomib and Carfilzomib in the treatment
of patients suffering from multiple myeloma has inspired research
and exploration of the UPS that could one day provide as many “druggable”
targets as the kinase/phosphatase proteome.8 Whereas the throughput of inhibitor discovery for members of the
UPS has increased dramatically, the development of novel methods to
quantify the enzyme activity in the UPS has lagged behind. The traditional
methods for measuring the enzyme activity include western blotting
and ELISA, both of which rely on the analysis of bulk cell lysates.
Although effective for preliminary discovery, all heterogeneity amongst
cells is lost because these methods report a population-averaged result.
Thus valuable information about distinct subpopulations, such as clonal
subgroups, is unavailable. To overcome this limitation, fluorescent
peptide-based reporters have been coupled with analytical methods
such as capillary electrophoresis (CE) and microfluidic separation
to assay single cells for intracellular enzyme activity.9 Peptide-based reporters can be rapidly synthesized
and easily modified and do not require complex manipulations for the
incorporation into single, living cells. Previous work has utilized
synthesized peptides to elucidate the underlying biological machinery
of the UPS5,10 and to monitor kinase and phosphatase activity
in intact single cells using CE.11 One
limitation of peptide-based reporters is their rapid degradation by
intracellular peptidases and proteases. Designing fluorescent peptide-based
reporters that report the activity of the UPS by the detection of
proteasome-mediated reporter degradation2 can be challenging. Often, a significant amount of the reporter
is degraded by cytosolic proteases before the activity of the UPS
can be detected. Previous work by Melvin et al.12 demonstrated that degron-based peptide substrates were
readily degraded in cytosolic lysates, suggesting a need for modifications
to make the substrates more stable and resistant to peptidase-mediated
degradation to function as an accurate reporter. Recent work demonstrated
the utility of protecting motifs by adding the secondary structure
to increase the lifetime of the peptide-based reporters in cells.13 As such, it was hypothesized that a β-hairpin
“protectide” conjugated on the N-terminus of an unstructured
primary degron could produce a viable fluorescent peptide-based reporter
of peptide ubiquitination or proteasome-mediated degradation.

This paper details the discovery and characterization of a family
of ornithine-rich, structured, primary degrons that are rapidly ubiquitinated
and highly resistant to degradation by intracellular peptidases. The
β-hairpin peptide OWOWO [Ac-OWVOVpGO(FAM)WIOQ-NH2] was initially thought to act solely as a “protectide”
for a previously established primary degron; however, the protectide
itself was discovered to be rapidly ubiquitinated in cell lysates.
This finding was novel as ubiquitin conjugation to an ornithine residue
had not previously been demonstrated in the literature. The secondary
structure of the peptide was verified using circular dichroism (CD)
and its degradation resistance in cell lysates was determined using
CE. Analysis of the ubiquitination kinetics and identification of
the optimal ubiquitination-site ornithine on the OWOWO peptide was
performed. Finally, preliminary studies were performed in the presence
of E1 and E3 enzyme inhibitors to identify enzyme targets for which
the ornithine-rich, β-hairpin primary degron could serve as
a potential reporter. The work presented here is an exciting first
step toward the development of the next generation of cell-compatible,
fluorescent, peptide-based ubiquitination reporters capable of directly
measuring E3 ligase and proteasome activity.

Results and Discussion
Ornithine-Rich
β-Hairpins Function as Primary Degrons
Capable of in Vitro Ubiquitination
A well-folded β-hairpin
“protectide” was added to the N-terminus of a previously
isolated portable degron developed by Bonger et al.14 to determine if the protecting motif could increase the
stability of the degron while not impeding its ability to be rapidly
ubiquitinated. Recently, Melvin et al.12 have confirmed that this degron could be incorporated into a peptide-based
substrate that functioned as a primary degron; however, the rate of
ubiquitination was similar to the rate of peptidase-mediated degradation,
limiting its use as a ubiquitination reporter. The protectide selected
to confer stability, named OWOWO (Figure 1A), was a modification of a β-hairpin
sequence previously characterized by Cline et al.13b and utilized by Yang et al.13a to increase peptide lifetime in a peptidase solution. The primary
degron (RRRG) was demonstrated by Melvin et al. to be rapidly ubiquitinated
in HeLa cell lysates when a lysine residue was positioned at the C-terminus.12 The protectide-conjugated degron (OWOWO-RRRG, Figure 1A) was ubiquitinated
in a time-dependent manner (Figure 1B, lanes 1–2). Interestingly, the peptide appeared
to be multimonoubiquitinated as demonstrated by the presence of several
higher molecular weight bands in a sample incubated with methylated
ubiquitin (MeUb) (Figure 1B, lane 1), a modified ubiquitin in which all lysine residues
were methylated to prevent polyubiquitin chain formation. Because
the peptide substrate contained a single lysine residue at the C-terminus,
it was suspected that the ornithine residues located on the OWOWO
protectide at positions 1, 4, and 11 were acting as additional ubiquitination
sites. The OWOWO peptide alone was incubated with either MeUb (Figure 1B, lanes 3–4)
or wild-type ubiquitin (Figure 1B, lanes 5–6). In both instances, ubiquitination was
observed confirming that the OWOWO peptide was capable of time-dependent
ubiquitination and indeed could function as a primary degron. Ubiquitination
of ornithines in cytosolic lysates has not been previously demonstrated.
Athough unexpected, this is not entirely surprising as the sole difference
between ornithine and lysine is the elimination of a CH2 group on the amino acid side chain.

sites. Substrates are acetylated at the N-terminus and amidated at
the C-terminus. FAM denotes 6-carboxyfluorescein, and p denotes d-proline. (B) Ubiquitination of β-hairpin conjugated
to a known degron (OWOWO-RRRG, lane 1–2) compared with β-hairpin
alone (OWOWO, lane 3–6) at the indicated time points using
either ubiquitin or MeUb. Ubiquitin-conjugated peptides were purified
using ubiquitin-binding beads, separated using SDS-PAGE, and visualized
using the fluorescein tag. Relative protein sizes (kDa) are compared
with the values obtained from a fluorescent protein marker (left of
the gel) with mono-, di-, tri-, and tetraubiquitinated species. (C)
Optimal ubiquitination site ornithine was identified with either ubiquitin
or no lysine ubiquitin. All reactions were incubated at 37 °C
for 2 h.

To further characterize this novel
primary degron and explore which
of the three ornithine residues was the favored ubiquitination site
(secondary degron), four new peptides were synthesized with a substitution
of arginine for all but one ornithine (OWRWR, RWOWR, and RWRWO) or
with no ornithine at all (RWRWR) (Figure 1A). Arginine was selected because it possesses
a positive charge similar to that of ornithine and is unable to undergo
ubiquitination. Ubiquitination of this library of potential degrons
was performed in the presence of either ubiquitin (Ub) or no-lysine
ubiquitin (No K Ub), a ubiquitin mutant in which all of the lysine
residues were mutated to arginine to eliminate polyubiquitin chain
formation (Figure 1C). The peptide with the N-terminal ornithine (OWRWR) exhibited the
most ubiquitination (Figure 1C, lanes 5–6). The two other ornithine locations at
position 4 (RWOWR) and position 11 (RWRWO) were also ubiquitinated
but to a lesser extent (Figure 1C, lanes 7–10). This suggested that although the ornithines
at position 4 and position 11 could be ubiquitinated, the N-terminal
ornithine was the preferred ubiquitination site or secondary degron.
The absence of any ubiquitination in the peptide with no ornithine
residues (RWRWR, Figure 1C, lanes 3–4) verified that the ornithine residues were indeed
the site of ubiquitination. Similar results were obtained in the absence
of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (data not shown), which confirmed
that although these ornithine-rich β-hairpins do function as
primary and secondary degrons, they are lacking the tertiary degron
needed for proteasome-mediated degradation. This suggests that this
motif may be able to function solely as an E3 ligase reporter.

One interesting observation was the presence of higher molecular
weight bands at ∼10, ∼18, and ∼26 kDa in OWOWO
samples incubated with MeUb (Figure 1B, lane 3–4), No K Ub (Figure 1C, even numbered lanes), and wild-type ubiquitin
(Figure 1B,C). The
location on the gel of the ∼10, ∼18, and ∼26
kDa bands was similar for peptides incubated with native ubiquitin,
No K Ub, or MeUb, suggesting that these bands correspond to peptides
with one, two, or three ubiquitins, respectively. The slightly higher
location of the di- and triubiquitinated species incubated with MeUb
was due to the higher molecular weight of MeUb (8.7 kDa) compared
with wild-type ubiquitin or No K Ub (8.6 kDa). There were two possible
explanations for the presence of the higher molecular weight bands.
The first was that the concentration of endogenous wild-type ubiquitin
in the S100 cytosolic lysates was sufficiently high to compete with
the supplemented MeUb or No K Ub to form polyUb chains. The second
explanation was that the presence of a single ubiquitin on two or
three of the ornithines of the peptide (multimonoubiquitination).
To explore these possibilities, the OWOWO peptide was incubated with
native Ub or No K Ub in the presence or absence of S100 lysates (Figure S1). The same molecular weight bands were
observed when the peptide was incubated in S100 lysates in the presence
of Ub or No K Ub (Figure S1, lanes 1–2).
Additionally, these same molecular weight bands were observed in the
absence of exogenous ubiquitin, suggesting the presence of endogenous
ubiquitin in the lysates and the possibility of peptide polyubiquitination
even when supplemented with No K Ub.

Kinetic Analysis of Time-Dependent
Ubiquitination of β-Hairpin
Degrons
Once it was determined that the β-hairpin degrons
were readily ubiquitinated, the ubiquitination kinetics were measured
to compare and contrast with that previously measured for other degron-based
peptide substrates. Time-dependent ubiquitination of the peptides
in cytosolic lysates was measured in the presence of No K Ub using
a ubiquitin pull-down assay. Ubiquitinated species were isolated using
agarose beads conjugated to a ubiquitin antibody, separated by gel
electrophoresis, and visualized using the fluorescein tag to identify
the time-dependent ubiquitination of OWRWR (Figure 2A) and OWOWO (Figure 2C). Peptide with greater than one ubiquitin
added was observed for both peptides and was likely due to the addition
of multiple single ubiquitins (multimonoubiquitination for OWOWO)
and polyubiquitination (for OWOWO and OWRWR). Quantification of time-dependent
ubiquitination was performed by measuring the fluorescent intensity
of the bands corresponding to mono-, di-, and triubiquitinated species
(Figure 2B,D). These
values were normalized by the fluorescent intensity of unreacted peptide
to calculate time-dependent relative ubiquitination. Next, the reaction
kinetics for the stepwise ubiquitination of the peptides was performed
using a modified kinetic model similar to that presented by Melvin
et al.12 The model incorporated first-order
reaction kinetics to describe the transfer of ubiquitin to an ornithine
residue on the peptide in addition to considering unmodified peptide
or degraded peptide (Figure 2E). The model, governed by a set of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs), was fit to the quantitative data using a Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to successively minimize the cumulative
sum of the squared deviation between the model and the data as previously
described by Melvin et al.12 The kinetic
model calculated three kinetic rate constants for mono- (k1), di- (k2), and tri- (k3) ubiquitinated species. One difference between
this model and the one reported previously by Melvin et al. was the
definition of the rate constant k4. Here,
the k4 term characterized the loss of
the peptide (or peptide no longer competent to participate in the
ubiquitination reaction). In the model, the presence of di- and triubiquitinated
species is represented by the presence of two or three ubiquitin species
on the peptide, that is, a diubiquitinated species represents both
the addition of two ubiquitin monomers to a single ornithine residue
or the addition of a single ubiquitin monomer to two different ornithine
residues. As expected, the kinetic model achieved a very good fit
for all three peptides tested with low values for the cSSD (Figure 2F, top) and Pearson
correlation coefficient values near 1 for most of the species tested
(Figure 2F, bottom).
As per convention, a positive Pearson correlation coefficient approaching
1 corresponded to a very good fit.

to mono- (k1), di- (k2), or tri- (k3) ubiquitinated
species along with a term (k4) for peptide
unable to participate in the reaction. cSSD is the cumulative sum
of the squared difference minimized in the model to achieve the desired
fit. Pearson correlation coefficients (rxy) describe the goodness of fit between the model
and experimental data for mono-, di-, and triubiquitinated species.

Peptide monoubiquitination (closed
squares) was the dominant reaction
product for both the OWRWR and OWOWO peptides (Figure 2B,D). The low degree of di- and tri-ubiquitination
for OWRWR was attributed to the lack of secondary and tertiary ubiquitination
sites coupled with the lower amount of endogenous ubiquitin. The observed
lack of di- and triubiquitinated OWOWO was ascribed to the N-terminal
ornithine being a highly preferred ubiquitination site relative to
the other ornithine residues (Figure 1C). The similar kinetic constants for di- and triubiquitinated
species (k2 and k3) for both OWOWO and OWRWR suggested that the presence of
the higher molecular weight bands observed for OWOWO was more likely
to be due to di- and tripolyubiquitination on the N-terminal ornithine
residue instead of multimonoubiquitination of the three potential
ornithine residues because the OWRWR peptide cannot be multimonoubiquitinated.
To explore the effect of secondary structure on peptide ubiquitination,
a scrambled sequence (Scram-OWOWO, Figure 1A) was synthesized and assayed for ubiquitination
in a cell lysate using the ubiquitin pull-down assay (Figure S2). Interestingly, while the di- (closed
circles) and tri- (open circles) ubiquitinated species were very low
for the structured peptides OWRWR and OWOWO (Figure 2B,D), the scrambled sequence exhibited a
higher degree of both di- and triubiquitination (Figure S2B). Moreover, the rate constants for di- and triubiquitinated
species for Scram-OWOWO were 1.5 times greater than those for the
structured peptides, suggesting an increased degree of multimonoubiquitination
of the three ornithine residues. This was attributed to the lack of
secondary structure in the peptide, which likely increased the availability
of the internal ornithine residues for multimonoubiquitination.

Structural Characterization of β-Hairpin Degron
CD
was used to determine the intrinsic structure of the degrons OWOWO
and OWRWR. Two closely related peptides, WKWK15 and WRWR,16 have been fully characterized
using NMR and CD for WKWK, and shown to be extremely well-folded (>93%
in both cases). Thus, we used CD to confirm that the changes made
to the degron sequences do not negatively impact the structure. Although
it was demonstrated that the secondary structure is not a requirement
for the ornithine-rich peptides to be ubiquitinated, it is well-established
that secondary structures like β-hairpins dramatically increase
the resistance of peptide substrates to proteases and peptidases.13 A scrambled version of the OWOWO peptide (Scram-OWOWO, Figure 1A) was also characterized
using CD to serve as a negative control as its scrambled sequence
should adopt a random coil structure. The resultant CD spectra of
Scram-OWOWO confirmed that it was unstructured based on the minima
near 195 nm (Figure 3). Conversely, the CD spectrum of the OWOWO peptide displayed characteristics
of this class of β-hairpin peptides with a minimum near 205
nm (Figure 3). Additionally,
the peptides exhibit a minimum near 215 and maximum near 225 nm that
arise from exciton coupling of the indole rings of the cross-strand
tryptophan residues, further supporting the correct fold and register.17 The CD spectrum of OWRWR similarly illustrated
β-hairpin characteristics with a minimum near 205 nm and exciton
coupling between the sidechains of the cross-strand tryptophan residues
(Figure 3). These spectra
are consistent with the CD spectrum of the related peptide, WKWK,
that has previously been characterized using both NMR and CD and shown
to adopt a well-folded β-hairpin.15 Although the mean residue ellipticities (MRE) of OWOWO and OWRWR
differ, neither exhibits a peak at 195 nm, which is the characteristic
of the random coil structure. Thus, the differences in MRE may be
related to subtle differences in tryptophan conformation and degree
of twist in the β-hairpin.15

using 40 μM peptide in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8 at
25 °C. Scram-OWOWO (blue) was determine to be a random coil while
OWOWO (green) and OWRWR (red) peptides exhibited spectra associated
with a well-folded β-sheet confirmation.

β-Hairpin Degrons Demonstrate Increased Resistance to
Intracellular Peptidases
An important feature of β-hairpin
peptides is their increased protease resistance under cytosolic conditions
relative to that of unstructured peptides. Previous β-hairpin
protectides identified by Cline et al. were highly resistant to peptidase-mediated
degradation.13b As such, it was essential
to determine whether the β-hairpin peptides identified in this
study not only acted as a primary degron but also exhibited the peptidase-resistant
properties of other β-hairpin protectides. To test this, the
OWRWR peptide was incubated with OPM2 lysates at 37 °C to mimic
the intracellular environment of multiple myeloma cells. After varying
the incubation times, peptide fragmentation was assayed by separating
the mixture using CE and identifying peptide fragments from their
fluorescence and migration times as previously described by Proctor
et al.18 The OWRWR peptide was resistant
to the degradation in the OPM2 lysates (Figure 4, black squares), with 80% of the full-length
peptide remaining after 180 min, yielding a half-life of 630 min for
the intact peptide in the cytosolic mixture. Conversely, the scrambled
version of the OWRWR peptide (termed Scram-OWRWR, sequence in Figure 1A) was almost completely
degraded in the OPM2 lysates within 60 min (Figure 4, blue circles), with a half-life of 30 min.
Similar to Scram-OWOWO, Scram-OWRWR did not exhibit secondary structure
owing to the randomization of the sequence (data not shown). Thus,
the well-folded nature of the OWRWR peptide resulted in a pronounced
increase in the stability when compared with its unstructured counterpart.
Another peptide that has previously been demonstrated to be rapidly
degraded (III-67B, sequence in Figure 1A) was used as an additional control and was found
to have a half-life of 4 min in OPM2 lysates (Figure 4, red triangles).11a Taken together, these results indicated that although the secondary
structure of the peptide was unnecessary for it to act as portable
degron (Figure 1D),
the β-hairpin was necessary to increase the lifetime of the
peptide in the cytosolic environment.

Figure 4 Analysis of peptide degradation in OPM2
lysates using CE. Stability
of structured and unstructured peptides was evaluated by incubation
with 2 mg/mL OPM2 lysates at 37 °C. Samples were removed from
the enzymatic mixture at the indicated time points and separated using
CE to identify and quantify the area of the peak corresponding to
the parent peptide. Percent of intact peptide was calculated by dividing
the area of the peak corresponding to the parent peptide at the indicated
time points to the area of the parent peptide at the 0 min time point.
The structured, β-hairpin degron OWRWR (black squares, t1/2 = 626.2 min) was substantially more resistant
to degradation than its unstructured counterpart Scram-OWRWR (blue
circles, t1/2 = 27.9 min) as evidenced
by a substantially greater amount of intact peptide and a significantly
higher half-life. An unstructured, rapidly degraded peptide (III-67B)
was used as a positive control to demonstrate the activity of the
OPM2 lysates (red triangles, t1/2 = 3.96
min). The zero minute time point was achieved using heat-shocked lysates
and served as the baseline for the intact peptide. Errors were calculated
using three separate experiments.

Select E3 Ligase Inhibitors Modulate OWRWR Ubiquitination
The use of the cytosolic lysates enabled characterization of the
ubiquitination and protease resistance of the β-hairpin primary
degrons but provided no information as to which E1, E2, and E3 enzymes
might be responsible for peptide ubiquitination. As the ornithine-rich
peptides were not derived from previously established degron sequences,
it was important to perform preliminary studies to identify which
E3 ligase families might be responsible for peptide ubiquitination.
To accomplish this objective, the single ornithine-containing β-hairpin
(OWRWR) was incubated with HeLa cytosolic lysates that were pretreated
with select commercially available E1 enzymes and E3 ligase inhibitors
in the presence of an excess of exogenous, full-length ubiquitin.
Ubiquitinated species were then purified from the mixture using agarose
beads coated with anti-ubiquitin. Five E3 ligase inhibitors were selected
including serdemetan,19 nutlin-3,20 SKPin C1,21 SMER3,22 and thalidomide,23 in addition to the E1 enzyme inhibitor PYR-41 (Figure 5). Each inhibitor was added
at a concentration three times that of the established IC50 values to ensure appropriate enzyme inhibition in the cytosolic
milieu. Additionally, all reactions were supplemented with a DUB inhibitor
(ubiquitin aldehyde) and proteasome inhibitor (MG-132) to prevent
deubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. A DMSO vehicle
control was also performed to evaluate the effect of the inhibitor
compounds (Figure 5, lane 1). The E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme inhibitor PYR-41 did
not alter ubiquitination of OWRWR (Figure 5, lane 7) relative to the control, suggesting
that a different E1 enzyme was responsible for initiating the ubiquitination
cascade acting on OWRWR. E3 ligase inhibitors nutlin-3 (Figure 5, lane 2), serdementan (Figure 5, lane 3), and thalidomide
(Figure 5, lane 6)
had no apparent effect on the ubiquitination of the OWRWR peptide.
Interestingly, the SKPin C1 compound, which inhibits the cullin-RING
ubiquitin E3 ligase SCF-Skp2, prominently reduced polyubiquitination
of OWRWR but not monoubiquitination (Figure 5, lane 4). Additionally, the SMER3 (small
molecule enhancer of rapamycin 3) compound, which is a specific inhibitor
of the E3 ligase SCF-MET30, significantly reduced both the poly- and
monoubiquitination of OWRWR (Figure 5, lane 5). These results suggest that the β-hairpin
primary degron identified in this study could act as reporters for
the SCF family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. This group of multiprotein
E3 ligases contain three core subunits including Skp1 (the bridging
protein), cullin (the major structural scaffold of the complex), and
RBX1 (the RING finger zinc-binding domain responsible for E2 ubiquitin-conjugating
enzyme binding). However, each member of the SCF family contains a
different F-box protein (e.g., Skp2 or Met30), enabling these E3 family
members to recognize and bind to specific target proteins. The results
presented here suggest that the β-hairpin OWRWR was recognized
and ubiquitinated by an SCF complex; however, its ubiquitination was
not constrained to a single F-box protein as a recognition metric.

inhibitors selectively decrease OWRWR ubiquitination
in cell lysates. The single free ornithine-containing OWRWR peptide
(10 μM) was incubated in HeLa S100 lysates for 2 h at 37 °C
in the presence of commercially available E1 and E3 enzyme inhibitors.
Inhibitors were added at the following concentrations (three times
the IC50 value for each compound): nutlin-3 (0.27 μM),
serdementan (30 μM), SKPin C1 (150 μM), SMER3 (300 μM),
thalidomide (90 μM), PYR-41 (30 μM), or a DMSO vehicle
control. Ubiquitin-conjugated peptides were purified using ubiquitin-binding
beads, separated using SDS-PAGE, and visualized using the fluorescein
tag. Relative protein sizes are compared with the values obtained
from a fluorescent marker (left side). Fluorescent species at the
appropriate molecular weight for mono-, di-, tri-, and tetraubiquitinated
peptides are labeled accordingly.

These results demonstrate that OWRWR acts as both a primary
degron
recognized by the SCF family of E3 ligases and a secondary degron
providing a site for mono- or polyubiquitination. Although the SCF-based
inhibitors have been demonstrated to inhibit ubiquitination of natural
target proteins found in the cell,21,22 it is possible
that they are able to recognize other unnatural primary degron sequences
such as OWRWR. Recently, Melvin et al. have identified a nine amino
acid long peptide (KGSYGK(FAM)RRR) based on a MDM2 binding region
on the tumor suppressor p53, which could be readily ubiquitinated
in cytosolic lysates.24 Interestingly,
the ubiquitination of this sequence was also impaired in the presence
of SKPin C1 and SMER3. Given that OWRWR is not a naturally occurring
sequence, it is possible that the SCF family of E3 ligases may have
a lack of specificity when it comes to the ubiquitination of short
peptide sequences, perhaps favoring polycationic peptides, as is the
case for OWRWR and the MDM2-based primary degrons. As such, this area
requires further study to identify the role of short peptide sequences
as potential primary degrons for the SCF family of E3 ligases. Nevertheless,
the results presented here provide the foundation for a new family
of primary degrons that are rapidly ubiquitinated and highly resistant
to intracellular degradation.

Conclusions
With
the rapid expansion in efforts to inhibit the proteasome,
there is a great need to expand the chemical reporters for characterizing
the enzymatic activity associated with E3 ligase and proteasome function.
To that end, we have identified a 12-residue β-hairpin peptide
that acts as both a primary degron for ubiquitination and a “protectide”,
demonstrating a 20-fold increase in protease resistance compared to
an unstructured peptide. Moreover, a screen of a panel of E3 ligase
inhibitors demonstrated that OWRWR is a potential substrate to detect
the ubiquitination mediated by members of the SCF family of E3 ligases,
an important group of E3 ligases that have been linked to several
pathologies.25 Finally, this is the first
example of ornithine residues acting as secondary degrons (e.g., ubiquitination
sites) on a ubiquitination reporter, which may provide broader benefits
as its incorporation into peptides increases protease resistance.
This protectide-based primary degron is thus a promising new tool
as a reporter for detecting ubiquitination and potentially characterizing
the proteasome activity.

Materials and Methods
Substrate Synthesis and
Purification
Peptides were
synthesized by automated solid-phase peptide synthesis on a Creosalus
TetrasUI peptide synthesizer using Fmoc-protected amino acids on a
CLEAR-amide resin purchased from Peptide Internationals. All natural
Fmoc-[N]-protected amino acids were acquired from Advanced Chem Tech.
Fmoc-Orn(ivDde)-OH was purchased from Chem Impex International. 6-Carboxyfluorescein
was obtained from Chem Impex International. Activation of amino acids
was performed with 4 equiv HBTU (2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium
hexafluorophosphate) and 4 equiv HOBt (hydroxybenzotriazole) in the
presence of 5 equiv DIPEA (N,N-diisopropylethylamine)
in DMF (dimethylformamide) or NMP (N-methylpyrrolidone).
Peptide deprotection was carried out in 2% DBU (1,8-diazobicyclie[5.4.0]undec-7-ene)
and 2% piperidine in DMF for 2 cycles of 15 min each. Each natural
amino acid coupling step was performed twice for 30 min or 1 h. For
coupling of Fmoc-Orn(ivDde)-OH (4 equiv), standard coupling agents
were used for a single coupling of 4 h. All peptides were acetylated
at the N-terminus with 5% acetic anhydride and 6% 2,6-lutidine in
DMF for 35 min. Deprotection of the Fmoc-Orn(ivDde)-OH side chain
was performed with 3% hydrazine monohydrate in DMF for 3 × 3
min. Removal of the ivDde protecting group was confirmed by the Kaiser
test. Conjugation of 6-carboxyfluorescein (4 equiv) was done using
4 equiv PyBOP (benzotriazol-1-yl-oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate),
HOBt (4 equiv), and DIPEA (8 equiv) in DMF and allowed to react overnight
in the dark. Cleavage of the peptide from the resin was performed
in 95:2.5:2.5 TFA (trifluoroacetic acid)/TIPS (triisopropylsilane)/dH2O for 3.5 h. TFA was evaporated and cleavage products were
precipitated with cold ethyl ether. The peptide was extracted into
water and lyophilized. It was then purified by reverse-phase HPLC
using an Atlantis C-18 semipreparative column first with a gradient
of 0–100% B over 60 min and second with a gradient of 0–100%
B over 100 min, where solvent A was 95:5 water/acetonitrile with 0.1%
TFA and solvent B was 95:5 acetonitrile/water with 0.1% TFA. After
purification the peptide was lyophilized to a powder and identified
using ESI or MALDI mass spectrometry.

Cell Culture and Lysate
Generation
HeLa S3 cells (ATCC)
were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM)
with 10% v/v bovine calf serum (HyClone) and maintained in a 37 °C,
5% CO2 environment. OPM-2 cells (a kind gift from Donald
McDonnell) were maintained in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 12%
fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 21.8 mM glucose, 8.6 mM HEPES (pH 7.4),
and 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate. All media components were from Cellgro
unless otherwise noted. All reagents used in following assays were
from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise noted. HeLa S100 cytosolic lysates
were generated from cells based on the Dignam protocol as previously
described.12 Isolated HeLa S100 cytosolic
lysates were quantified with a Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific),
aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C.

Ubiquitin Pull-down Assay
Ubiquitinated reporter was
isolated using a ubiquitin pull-down assay to concentrate the reporter
and to remove cell lysate debris so that the ubiquitinated reporter
was readily detected and quantified on SDS-PAGE gels using the fluorescein
appended to the peptide. The ubiquitin pull-down assay was carried
out at the indicated times at 37 °C in a total reaction volume
of 100 μL containing assay buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6 and
5 mM MgCl2) with 2 mM DTT, 20 μg/mL ubiquitin aldehyde
(Boston Biochem), 100 μM MG-132 (EMD Chemicals), 400 μg/mL
ubiquitin, methylated ubiquitin, or no lysine ubiquitin (Boston Biochem),
1× ATP energy-regenerating solution (ATP-ERS, Boston Biochem),
4.2 μg of indicated peptide substrate, and 2 mg/mL HeLa S100
cytosolic lysates as the source of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes. At the
end of the indicated times, samples were incubated with Control-Agarose
beads (LifeSensors), diluted in TBS-T buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0,
150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% v/v Tween-20), for 60 min on a tube rotator
at 4 °C. Samples were subsequently centrifuged at 1800×g for 5 min to pellet and remove control beads. The supernatant
was transferred to a solution of Agarose-TUBEs (LifeSensors) diluted
in TBS-T and incubated overnight on a tube rotator at 4 °C. Ubiquitin-bound
beads were washed 5× with 1× TBS-T, and then, the samples
were eluted off the bead with 2× tricine sample buffer, heated
for 5 min (>90 °C), and then isolated by centrifugation for
5
min at 13 000×g. Samples were loaded
onto SDS-PAGE gels (precast 16.5% Mini PROTEAN Tris-Tricine, Bio-Rad)
using 1× Tris-tricine running buffer and visualized with a Typhoon
Imager (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Gels were quantified using ImageJ
(US National Institute of Health) by comparing the sample intensity
to the unreacted parent peptide intensity, which is not depicted in
the gels.

Pull-down assays performed in the presence of chemical
inhibitors were completed as described above except that the reaction
mixture contained 10 μM peptide and was supplemented with 1
μL of Complete ULTRA (Roche) and 1 μL of PhosSTOP (Roche).
The HeLa S100 lysates were preincubated for 60 min with the following
single inhibitor compounds (all obtained from LifeSensors) at the
following concentrations (all three times the listed IC50 value for each compound) before the addition of the remaining reaction
mixture components: 30 μM serdementan, 0.27 μM nutlin-3,
150 μM SKPin C1, 300 μM SMER3, 90 μM thalidomide,
or 30 μM PYR-41. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C
for 2 h and then subjected to ubiquitin-conjugated protein isolation
as described above. Samples were separated using SDS-PAGE and visualized
with a Typhoon imager.

Circular Dichroism
Peptide concentrations
were determined
based on the absorbance of FAM at 492 nm. CD spectroscopy data were
collected using an Applied Photophysics Chirascan circular dichroism
spectrophotometer. Spectra were generated at 25 °C with a wavelength
scan (260–185 nm) using 0.5 s scanning in a 0.1 cm cell. All
peptides were at a final concentration of 40 μM in 10 mM sodium
phosphate buffer (pH 8.02).

Peptidase Degradation Reactions
Peptide degradation
studies were carried out in lysates prepared from the OPM2 cell line.
Briefly, 1 × 106 cells/mL OPM2 cells were harvested,
washed 2×, and pelleted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 137
mM NaCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 27 mM KCl, and 1.75
mM KH2PO4 at pH 7.4). The cell pellet was re-suspended
in an approximately equivalent volume of mammalian protein extraction
reagent (MPER, ThermoFisher) to the volume of the cell pellet (∼300–500
μL) and then vortexed for 10 min at room temperature. Following
this, the mixture was centrifuged at 14 000×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred to
a centrifuge tube and stored on ice until use. Total protein concentration
was determined using fluorescamine as previously described.18 To investigate peptide stability, 10 μM
peptide was incubated with lysates diluted to a total protein concentration
of 2 mg/mL in an assay buffer (10 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.6) at 37 °C
in the dark. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed at set
intervals, at which point further peptidase activity was quenched
by heating the aliquots at 90 °C for 5 min followed by immediately
freezing in liquid nitrogen and then storage at −20 °C
until analysis using CE. The 0 min time point measurements were made
using lysates that were heat-killed before peptide incubation. Samples
were analyzed using a Beckman Coulter ProteomeLab PA800 automated
CE-LIF system CE with laser-induced fluorescence (CE-LIF, 488 nm)
as previously described.18 Before analysis
using CE, samples were thawed to room temperature and diluted 1:100
in separation buffer (125 mM sodium tetraborate, 3% v/v Tween-20,
pH 8.5). Before each analysis, the capillary was washed with 1 M NaOH
for 2 min, dH2O for 2 min, and separation buffer for 2
min. Separation was carried out in a fused-silica capillary (30 μm
inner capillary and 360 μm inner capillary; Polymicro Technologies)
with a total length of 30 cm and an effective length of 20 cm. Samples
were injected into the capillary by applying 0.5 psi pressure for
5 s, and separation was initiated by applying a negative voltage of
6.5 kV. Percent intact peptide remaining was calculated by the corrected
area under the parent peptide peak divided by the total corrected
peak area (the area under all peaks of the electropherogram) for each
time point. The identity of the parent peptide peak was confirmed
using the parent peptide alone and verified with the t = 0 min electropherogram. The data were analyzed using commercial
software (32 Karat, version 8.0, Beckman Coulter). All degradation
reactions and analysis was performed in triplicate.

Kinetic Analysis
of Substrate Ubiquitination
The analysis
of substrate ubiquitination was performed using a series of ODEs to
model peptide ubiquitination as previously described.12 One change in the current version of the model was kinetic
rate constant k4 (Figure 2). Here, the k4 term characterized loss of peptide (or peptide no longer competent
to participate in the ubiquitination reaction). Possible mechanisms
for peptide loss include degradation, binding to cytosolic constituents,
or sequestration into cellular subcompartments. No K Ub was used as
the exogenous source of ubiquitin in all experiments to reduce the
possibility of peptide polyubiquitin; however, the presence of endogenous
ubiquitin in the HeLa S100 cytosolic lysates prevented the complete
elimination of substrate polyubiquitination. The bands identified
as mono-, di-, and triubiquitinated peptides were selected based on
the approximate molecular weight of the ubiquitinated peptide compared
with the standard indicated on the gel. As all three peptides display
a similar molecular weight, a band at the same migration distance
was selected for all three peptides in each gel. These bands are denoted
in Figures 2 and S2. Kinetic rate constants were determined using
a MCMC algorithm in MATLAB. Experimental concentration values were
determined by 1  where Co is the
initial concentration of the parent peptide, Ci is the experimental concentration for a sample at a given
time, Iexp is the intensity of the sample
band determined by ImageJ, and Iparent is the intensity of the unmodified parent peptide (run alongside
experimental samples in every gel).
