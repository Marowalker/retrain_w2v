A facile
synthesis method is proposed for the mass production of
high-quality CsPbBr3 perovskite powder. It is shown that
the proposed synthesis protocol is capable of producing polycrystalline
CsPbBr3 powder in quantities greater than 10 g. The derived
thin films by thermal evaporation and spin-coating are of compact
morphologies (root-mean-square roughness < 4 nm) without voids
and pinholes. Moreover, the thin films show obvious photoluminescence
(PL) with a narrow (bandwidth < 19 nm) peak centered at ∼520
nm, which is blue-shifted compared with the PL emission of the powder
at 542 nm. The powder and the spin-coated film exhibit superior PL
stability under long-term ambient conditions and in thermal cycling
experiments performed at temperatures up to ∼120 °C. Accordingly,
optoelectronic applications including the fabrication and characteristics
of the electroluminescence device, the organic–inorganic powder
doped with methylammonium and formamidinium ions, and fluorescent
greenish-blue quantum dots are also demonstrated. On the basis of
these demonstrations, the synthesized CsPbBr3 perovskite
powder can be expected to empower the advances in perovskite-related
optoelectronics in the future.

1 Introduction
Since
the discovery of facile synthesis and potential optoelectronic
applications in 2009,1 lead halide perovskites
have become the subject of intense research worldwide for their prowess
in versatile synthesis and record-breaking device performance, colloidal
nanocrystal or quantum dot (QD) synthesis,2 nanocrystal pinning or vapor treatment for film deposition,3,4 solar cells with certified power conversion efficiency of 23.3%,5 and green CsPbBr3 light-emitting diodes
(LEDs) with an ultrahigh luminance over 590 000 cd/m2,6 to name a few. Despite these astonishing
success and achievements, it is well-known that poor stability is
the key issue to hinder halide perovskites from practical commercialization.7 To overcome this drawback, cesium cations were
introduced to replace the organic part, ammonium (MA) CH3NH3+ or formamidinium (FA) CH(NH2)2+, in hybrid lead halides, and indeed, all-inorganic
systems show higher thermal stability and thus better device reliability.8,9 Similarly, sodium and tin were proposed to partially substitute
MA and lead cations, respectively, in halide perovskites to improve
the long-term stability of the device.10,11

To deposit
a lead halide film, a most popular form for optoelectronic
applications, MAX, FAX, or CsX (X denotes the halogen) is typically
used as the source of large cations to be mixed with PbX2, the source of small cations, in peculiar protic solvent to form
the precursor solution based on the simple one-step method. With a
specific treatment or polymer addition, the starting precursor solution
is compatible for accessing a smooth film on substrates by any solution
process.3−5 However, the exact molar ratio of the monovalent
large cations (MA+, FA+, or Cs+)
to the Pb cation in precursors is crucial and not as straightforward
as the stoichiometric ratio in ABX3 halide perovskites.
For instance, the ratio of MAX or CsX to PbX2 larger than
1.0 even 2.0 is frequently adopted to prevent the formation of impurity
phases (ex: excess Pb metal or residual PbX2), which probably
cause the exciton quenching in devices.3−6 Therefore, when the precursor solutions
are used for solid thin-film preparation, those unreacted and non-coordinating
precursors are deposited as well and irremovable via any post-deposited
treatments, no matter the simple one-step or sophisticated two-step
coating methods are used.12 Being an alternative,
Hoffman et al. successfully obtained the continuous and smooth CsPbBr3 films by fusing the purified perovskite nanocrystals coated
on TiO2 films at 250 °C.13 However, the thermal treatment entirely caused the photoluminescence
(PL) quenching of the annealed CsPbBr3 film. As a consequence,
not only the optical and electrical but also the structural properties
such as morphology, crystal grain size, and crystallinity of the thin
films are affected.

In the present study, we demonstrated the
facile synthesis of CsPbBr3 powder by dropping hydrohalic
acid into the CsBr and PbBr2 solution at room temperature.
By further precipitation–redispersion
procedure, those excess unreactants can thus be removed. In this way,
the synthesis of CsPbBr3 powder is capable for mass production
for optoelectronics industry. From the PL measurement, we found that
not only the CsPbBr3 powder but also the hereby spin-coated
thin film are highly stable in ambient air and after thermal stress
at temperature higher than 120 °C.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Synthesis of CsPbBr3 Powder
To synthesize the CsPbBr3 powder, 1.9 mmol PbBr2 and CsBr were added in 3 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and the
solution was vigorously stirred for 30 min. Subsequently, 3 mL of
hydrobromic acid (HBr) was added dropwise into the transparent solution
with continuous stirring and the orange turbid solution was immediately
observed indicating the formation of CsPbBr3. In fact,
HBr was also reported to be added in the precursor solution to reduce
the voids and pinholes of the spin-coated MAPbBr3 films.14,15 After centrifuging the solution and discarding the supernatant,
the precipitate was washed twice by adding certain amount of ethanol
to remove unreacted agents. Finally, orange CsPbBr3 powder
with a net weight of ∼900 mg was obtained by vacuum-drying
the precipitate overnight. As shown in Figure S1, the product can be easily scaled up over 12 g by increasing
the amounts of precursors for mass production. On the basis of our
preliminary characterization, the massive amount of the powder precursor
sealed in the glass bottle can be stored at room temperature in the
ambient environment without degradation for over 6 months.

2.2 Film Deposition
The dry CsPbBr3 powder was
then subjected to film deposition. By thermal
evaporation at 5 × 10–6 Torr, a high-quality
film with the thickness exceeding 100 nm can be readily deposited
on various substrates such as silicon or indium–tin–oxide
(ITO)/glass. Also, 290 mg (0.5 mmol) of the CsPbBr3 powder
precursor was dissolved in 1.5 mL of DMSO for film deposition by solution
process. It should be mentioned that unlike those strongly emissive
CsPbBr3 nanocrystals dispersed in hexane or toluene, our
CsPbBr3 DMSO solution is colorless and transparent under
normal light irradiation (see Figure S2). Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) was then added into the solution in
the weight ratio of CsPbBr3/PEO = 1:0.07, from which the
yellowish CsPbBr3 films can be obtained by spin-coating
at 3000 rpm for 80 s and baking at 60 °C for 30 min on substrates
pretreated with O2-plasma.

2.3 Synthesis
of CsPbBr3 QDs
To synthesize the CsPbBr3 QDs, 0.2 mmol CsPbBr3 powder was mixed with 0.25 mL of
oleylamine and 0.5 mL of oleic
acid in 5 mL of dimethylformamide under stirring at 60 °C for
3 h to completely dissolve the powder. After cooling down to room
temperature, 1 mL of the precursor solution was injected into 10 mL
of toluene to obtain the well-dispersed QDs.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterization of CsPbBr3 Powder
and Films
The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential
thermal analysis (DTA) curves of the perovskite powder are shown in Figure 1. The abrupt weight
loss at 214 °C should be attributed to the ignition of DMSO or
its related complex because of the exothermic peak shown in the DTA
curve. Very low weight loss of ∼0.17% at this stage indicates
that twice washing by ethanol is sufficient to remove DMSO residues
in the produced powder. The onset of decomposition is at ∼510
°C because of the evaporation of PbBr2, and the obvious
weight loss at ∼568 °C is due to the melting of powder.16 The high-temperature sustainability of the powder
is also a unique merit to remove those unremovable impurities by precipitation
purification during synthesis. As shown, the weight loss is only 5.8%
of its original weight as the temperature increases to 600 °C,
indicating the high thermal stability of CsPbBr3.

Figure 1 TGA and DTA
curves of perovskite powder.

From the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image shown in
the
inset of Figure 2,
the CsPbBr3 powder comprised tetragonal-shaped microcrystals
with sizes ranging from a few to tens of micrometers. The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of the synthesized powder and evaporated and spin-coated
films are presented in Figure 2. The peaks at 2θ = 21.52°, 26.36°, 30.40°,
30.72°, and 34.37° are in good agreement with diffractions
from (020), (022), (004), (220), and (222) planes of orthorhombic
polycrystalline CsPbBr3 perovskite which features the splitting
peaks at 30°–31°, without detectable secondary phases
such as PbBr2 and PEO.17 It
indicates that the synthesis powder and hereby derived thin films
are high-quality CsPbBr3 polycrystals and inherit the superior
properties widely reported in general. More specifically, from the
total X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of the as-synthesized
powder shown in Figure S3a, the molar ratio
of incorporated Cs, Pb, and Br elements is 1:0.98:3.05, highly close
to the ideal stoichiometry of CsPbBr3. Low intensity of
peaks for carbon and oxygen elements corresponds to minimal residues
of DMSO and ethanol. In the Pb 4f core-level spectrum (Figure S3b), the peak corresponding to 4f7/2 is centered at ∼138 eV and no obvious signal was
detected in the energy range for metal Pb,18,19 which means the peak is mainly associated with the stoichiometric
CsPbBr3.

Figure 2 XRD patterns of perovskite CsPbBr3 powder and
the derived
films. The XRD spectra indicate that the perovskites are with an orthorhombic
crystal structure. Inset is the SEM image of the powder.

As shown in Figure 3, the optical absorption spectra of the spin-coated
and evaporated
films exhibit a distinct absorption peak at 515 and 516 nm, respectively,
while the strong excitonic emission peaks at 519 and 522 nm with narrow
full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of 17.6 and 18.9 nm are depicted
in the PL spectra. The nominal shift of the absorption peak for the
evaporated film compared to that of the spin-coated film maybe attributed
to the small discrepancy of crystal grain sizes and uniformity,20 which also results in the shift of the PL peak.
The band gap energy of 2.356 and 2.360 eV is thus determined for the
evaporated and spin-coated films from the transformed Kubelka–Munk
function (see Figure S4).21,22 The PL spectrum of the powder is also shown for comparison of the
peak shift. Considering the weaker PL intensity of the powder compared
to that of the thin film, the large blue shift of PL peak position
is probably a result of defect-related bound exciton emission in the
powder.23

CsPbBr3 powder
and the derived evaporated and spin-coated films. Inset is an image
of the CsPbBr3 powder under UV irradiation.

For lead halide perovskites, the deposition of
a smooth and continuous
thin film for optoelectronic applications is always challenging and
never being straightforward, as the homogeneous and even morphology
is the essential factor toward efficient device applications. The
topographical atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the evaporated
and spin-coated thin films are measured and shown in Figure 4. The root-mean-square (rms)
roughnesses of the evaporated and spin-coated films on Si substrates
and the spin-coated ones on the ITO/glass substrate are 3.5, 2.9,
and 3.1 nm, respectively, which is homogeneous and smooth enough for
most optoelectronic devices. As shown, small and uniform crystalline
grains can be obtained by thermal evaporation with the deposition
rate lower than 0.2 Å/s. Despite the similar grain size shown
in Figure 4b,c, the
slight rougher surface of CsPbBr3 films spin-coated on
ITO/glass should be attributed to the roughness (∼5 nm) of
underneath ITO films.24 Except the minor
voids of spin-coated films on ITO/glass, no pin holes responsible
for leading electrical short are found in all deposited films. The
thickness of both evaporated and spin-coated films was determined
as ∼114 nm by scratching a part of the film to create the difference
of height (see Figure S5).

and (b) spin-coated CsPbBr3 films on silicon substrates
and (c) spin-coated one on the ITO/glass
substrate. The scale bar represents 1 μm.

3.2 Air Stability
As shown in Figure 5, the air stability
of the CsPbBr3 powder on an Al foil and the spin-coated
film on the Si substrate were evaluated by recording the long-term
PL intensity of samples exposing in an ambient environment at 25 °C
and with 50–70% relative humidity. It should be mentioned that
the air exposure time-dependent PL intensity of the evaporated film
was not measured because of its less PL efficiency under the irradiation
of a UV (λ ≈ 400 nm) LED, the excitation source. Therefore,
the characteristics of the measured film in the following discussion
solely referred to those of the spin-coated film. In Figure 5, PL intensities exceeding
83% of the original value from the powder can be retained for up to
∼100 h. Though the intensity seems to slowly increase after
∼70 h, the fluctuation is not as significant as that from the
film which rapidly increases to >140% within 1.5 h and becomes
∼198%
after 100 h. The discrepancy of these results can be explained by
the prepared sample condition for analysis. The powder was pressed
to be a thick film with a thickness over 300 μm, whereas the
thickness of a spin-coated film is only about 100 nm. That is, the
effect of air exposure is quickly responded in the thin spin-coated
film, whereas most of the beneath powder does not directly expose
to the air and the measured PL only shows the ensemble result. On
the basis of this demonstration, the CsPbBr3 powder and
spin-coated film are immune to environmental degradation from air
and moisture and can be directly exposed in ambient air for several
days at least. On the other hand, the increase of PL intensity with
the increase of air exposure time has been reported in the printed
3–4 μm-thick MAPbBr3/PEO composite film and
the authors directly related this phenomenon to the efficiency improvement
of derived perovskite LEDs.25 On the basis
of the increase of PL lifetime, the authors attributed the PL enhancement
by air exposure to the decrease of defect density due to self-healing
of the perovskite lattice upon moisture.

Figure 5 PL intensity ratio of
CsPbBr3 powder and spin-coated
film as a function of air exposure time.

3.3 Thermal Stability
The thermal stability
of the powder and spin-coated film was also evaluated by recording
the PL intensity in thermal cycling experiments. To avoid the influence
of air and moisture exposure, samples were heated on a hotplate in
a nitrogen-filled glovebox with both oxygen and moisture concentration
at ≤1 ppm. As shown in Figure 6, the measurement begins at 30 °C and the temperature
is increased to 120 or 140 °C and then decreased to 30 °C.
As the temperature elevates, the PL intensity of the powder gradually
reduced to 90% at 140 °C because of the thermal quenching effect.
Noticeably, the subsequent decrease of temperature does not significantly
recover the PL intensity, consistent with the observation in alkyl-phosphate-coated
CsPbBr3 QDs by Xuan et al.26 Unlike organic and inorganic lead halide nanocrystals undergoing
severe PL quenching due to thermally assisted defect trapping, phase
transition, or structural decomposition at high temperatures,27,28 the CsPbBr3 powder exhibits the much stable thermal stability,
even though the irreversible PL intensity. In the present research,
the color and lattice structure of the powder do not have apparent
difference after thermal stressing. Therefore, the superior thermal
stability of the pristine CsPbBr3 powder without sophisticated
decoration or treatment should be attributed to the reduction of nonradiative
defects and impurities via purification in the synthesis procedure.

Figure 6 Variation
of PL intensity ratio of CsPbBr3 powder and
spin-coated film with measurement temperature. Arrows indicate the
testing sequence.

For the CsPbBr3 film, a very different variation of
PL intensity was observed. With increasing temperature, the intensity
initially increases at temperatures below 90 °C and rapidly decreases
to 58% at 120 °C. The initial intensity improvement of PL intensity
at temperatures below 90 °C can be simply explained as the annealing
effect, and the thermal quenching effect influences the PL when the
temperature continues to increase. The observed variation well explains
that the typical annealing temperature for the CsPbBr3 films
is below 100 °C. Later, in the process of cooling down to room
temperature, the remarkable enhancement of PL intensities beyond the
initial values was recorded. Being a possible interpretation, it was
reported that the existence of second-phase CsPb2Br5 during the synthesis of CsPbBr3 QDs could be beneficial
for the device fabrication.29 With a higher
amount of halogen atoms, the CsPb2Br5 near the
crystal grain boundary could prevent the excitons being trapped by
the defects (the so-called self-passivation effect), and optoelectronic
devices with higher efficiency could thus be achieved. Therefore,
the thermally induced phase transition from CsPbBr3 to
CsPb2Br5 might be responsible for the observed
PL enhancement of spin-coated CsPbBr3 film during cooling.
However, from the XRD spectra of the samples before and after thermal
stress (see Figure S6), no apparent difference
is detected probably because of a small amount of CsPb2Br5 crystal.

3.4 Fabrication and Characterization
of EL Devices
On the basis of the above results, the deposition
conditions of
the spin-coated CsPbBr3 films were then applied to fabricate
the electroluminescence (EL) devices. The device structure can be
simply described as ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)
(PEDOT:PSS)/CsPbBr3/2,2′,2″-(1,3,5-benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole) (TPBi)/Ca/Al where the spin-coated PEDOT:PSS
(Clevios P VP 4083) and thermally evaporated TPBi (E-Ray Optoelectronics
Technology Co.) served for hole injection and electron transporting,
respectively. The luminance–current density–voltage
(L–J–V) curves of the EL device are shown in Figure 7. As shown, a very low light turn-on voltage
of about 3.3 V is observed accompanying with the maximum luminance
of ∼3700 cd/m2 at 8.0 V. From the difference of
current turn-on (2.3 V) to light turn-on (3.3 V) voltages, it is anticipated
that the device performance can be further improved by inserting a
hole-transport layer such as poly(N,N′-bis(4-butylphenyl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)benzidine) or poly(9,9′-dioctylfluorene-co-N-(4-butylphenyl)diphenyl amine). In
the inset of Figure 7, the EL spectrum is peaked at 519.5 nm, which is very close to the
PL peak at 519 nm. Furthermore, the spectral width of EL spectrum
is slightly broadened to 18.4 nm, which is also similar to that of
PL spectrum.

3.5 Demonstration of MA-, FA-Doped
CsPbBr3 Powder, and CsPbBr3 QDs
Finally,
to demonstrate
the flexibility of the facile synthesis in this study, partial CsBr
precursor was replaced with MABr and FABr in the synthesis procedure
to produce MA0.3Cs0.7PbBr3 and FA0.3Cs0.7PbBr3 powder. The corresponding
XRD patterns are compared with that of pristine CsPbBr3 powder and are shown in Figure 8, and obvious peak shifts to higher angles are observed,
indicating the successful incorporation of MA and FA atoms into the
lattice. The appearance of MACsPbBr3 and FACsPbBr3 powder is slightly darker than that of CsPbBr3. With
the same total molar amount of precursors of large cations (CsBr,
MABr, and FABr), the produced MACsPbBr3 and FACsPbBr3 powder is fewer, that is, the molar ratio of large cations
to the small cation (PbBr2) has to be optimized in the
synthesis of MACsPbBr3 and FACsPbBr3 powder.
On the other hand, the CsPbBr3 powder was adopted to replace
the CsBr and PbBr2 in the room temperature synthesis of
CsPbBr3 QDs based on the protocol previously reported,30 as mentioned in the Experimental
Section. However, different to the reported green-emitting
QDs, our QDs exhibit strong greenish-blue luminance under UV irradiation
as shown in Figure 9. The emission is peaked at 492 nm with a fwhm of 31 nm.

illumination.

light and UV irradiation, respectively.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
demonstrated the facile synthesis and characteristics
of CsPbBr3 powder and the evaporated and spin-coated thin
films. The produced amount of high-quality CsPbBr3 powder,
namely the single-source precursor, can easily exceed 10 g, after
twice purification to remove unreactants and unwanted side products.
With proper deposition conditions, smooth and continuous films with
rms roughnesses below 4 nm can be obtained by thermal evaporation
or spin-coating. According to the results of long-term measurement
of PL intensity in ambient air, the powder and spin-coated films are
very stable without significant PL degradation for ∼100 h.
Their high thermal stabilities are also demonstrated in the thermal
cycling experiment. Finally, the EL device with a spin-coated CsPbBr3 emissive layer exhibits low light turn-on voltage of 3.3
V and a maximum luminance of ∼3700 cd/m2. On the
basis of these demonstrations, the facile synthesis of purified lead
halide perovskite powder is promising and highly viable for next-generation
optoelectronics.
