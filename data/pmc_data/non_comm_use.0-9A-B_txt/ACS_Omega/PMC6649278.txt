Development
of metal-doped carbon dots (CDs) to effectively modulate
their electronic properties and surface chemical reactivities is still
in its early stage. In this paper, a facile solid-phase synthesis
strategy was developed to synthesize Cu-doped CDs (Cu-CDs) using citric
acid as the carbon source and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O as the dopant, respectively. The as-prepared Cu-CDs exhibited
superior peroxidase-like activity to horseradish peroxidase and were
stable under a wide range of pH and temperatures. Consequently, the
Cu-CD-based chemiluminescence sensing was applied to sensitively detect
glucose with a low detection limit of 0.32 μM, and the recoveries
and the relative standard deviation of the serum sample are 87.2–112.2
and 8.16% (n = 6), respectively. Notably, the proposed
chemiluminescence sensing was also successfully applied for label-free
detection of glucose in complex biological samples, which envisioned
its potential applications in clinical diagnosis and other analytical
assays.

1 Introduction
As
a versatile analytical technique, chemiluminescence (CL) assays
have received considerable attention because of their fastness, very
high sensitivity, and a broad range of analytical applications with
no monochromator required.1−3 For a traditional CL immunoassay
strategy, a natural enzyme, such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP),
was extensively used as a catalyst to achieve highly sensitive determinations.
However, the natural enzyme are often limited for its some serious
shortcomings (including poor stability, limited sources, and lack
of long-term stability under environment changes).1,4 Therefore,
development of an artificial synthetic peroxidase-like nanomaterial
acting as the catalyst mimicking the native enzyme attracts growing
interest.

On the basis of this consideration, various types
of peroxidase-like
nanomaterials, such as metal nanoparticles (NPs),5 metallic oxide NPs,6,7 metal–organic
frameworks,8 and carbon NPs,9,10 have been reported for strengthening the highly sensitive CL detection.
Among these artificial enzymes, carbon dots (C-dots) have attracted
growing attention due to its unique electron transfer, a large specific
surface area, and broadband light-absorbing abilities.11,12 For instance, Jiang et al. reported that CDs could effectively enhance
the NaIO4–H2O2 CL reaction.13 Shi et al. demonstrated that CDs have an intrinsic
peroxidase-like activity to oxidation of 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine
(TMB) by hydrogen peroxide.14 Guo et al.
reported that the catalytic activity of CDs is mainly affected by
the surface states. Specially, carbonyl-functionalized CDs have better
enhanced ability for the luminol CL reaction, and after being reduced,
the CL intensity decreased significantly.9 It is worth to propose a strategy for the facile synthesis of carbonyl-functionalized
CDs as peroxidase mimetics in the CL reaction.

Recently, some
reported strategies indicated that the intrinsic
properties of CDs can be effectively tuned by doping with heteroatoms
and/or surface passivation.15,16 Doping and/or surface
passivation could provide a means for emerging chemical reactivities
and potential applications of CDs because of additional chemical groups
associated with CDs.17 Consequently, some
efforts, to enhance their photocatalytic ability, have been devoted
to the preparation of doped CDs.18−20 More interestingly,
metal atom doping can improve the optical properties as well as novel
functionalities of the CDs because of its different band structures.21 For example, Ni-doped CDs can greatly enhance
the efficiency of hydrogen production because of the easy electronic
transfer between Ni-doped CDs and solution.22 A fluorescent probe based on Zn-doped CDs was proposed for highly
sensitive detection of glucose because of the heteroatom-directed,
oxidized carbon-based surface passivation.23 After Cu and N co-doping, CDs were used as a novel photocatalyst
due to their electron-accepting and donating ability enhanced.18

Inspired by the above observations, herein,
a facile one-pot synthesis
strategy was proposed to prepare Cu-doped CDs (Cu-CDs) using citric
acid (CA) and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O
as precursors (Scheme 1). During pyrolysis, Cu2+ was used not only as a doped
atom but also as an oxidant to form carbonyl-functionalized CDs. The
as-prepared Cu-CDs exhibited superior peroxidase-like activity to
HRP. Meanwhile, the catalytic activity of as-obtained Cu-CDs was not
obviously changed under a wide range of pH and temperatures. More
importantly, CL sensing based on Cu-CDs could be used for sensitive
and selective determination of glucose.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Cu-CDs
The morphology
and structure of the as-prepared Cu-CDs are shown in Figure 1. According to the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) image (Figure 1a), the size distribution of Cu-doped CDs
was mainly in the range of 6.0–16 nm with an average size of
11.0 nm (Figure 1b),
which was comparable to that of the reported Cu-CDs (around 10.5 nm).21 The high-resolution TEM image (Figure 1a, inset) shows the lattice
parameter of the as-prepared Cu-CDs, which is measured to be 0.21
nm, which correspond to the diffraction planes of sp2 graphitic
carbon.24 In comparison to weaker photoluminescence
of Cu-CD, the photoluminescence quantum yield of bare CD calculated
using quinine sulfate as a reference is up to 16.8%.

Figure 1 TEM image (a) and the
diameter distribution (b) of Cu-CDs.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to reveal
the composition of the as-synthesized Cu-CDs. Figure 2a is the XPS survey spectrum of Cu-CDs, which
indicated that C 1s, O 1s, and Cu 2p signals appeared at 287.3, 530.3,
and 936.6 eV, respectively. It illustrated the successful doping of
Cu atoms in Cu-CDs. Significantly, a new peak at 530.5 eV could be
observed in the high-resolution O 1s spectrum of Cu-CDs (Figure S1), which was ascribed to O–Cu
after Cu doping.25 These results further
proved that Cu atoms were perfectly doped in Cu-CDs. As shown in Figure 2b, the C 1s spectrum
consisted of four types of peaks at 284.0, 284.6, 285.8, and 287.6
eV, which were well-fitted into C–C/C=C, C–O,
C=O, and C(O)–O, respectively.26 Three peaks at 529.8, 531.1, and 531.6 eV in the O 1s spectrum (Figure S1) can be ascribed to C–O, C=O,
and C–O–C, respectively.27 The results mentioned above confirmed the existence of −OH
and −COOH groups on the surface of Cu-CDs.

Figure 2 XPS survey spectrum (a)
and XPS high-resolution survey of C 1s
(b) of Cu-CDs.

The functional groups
of CA are prone to coordinate with Cu2+, which might result
in electron transport between CA and
Cu2+ in the process of synthesizing Cu-CDs. To bear out
this hypothesis, the UV–vis spectrum of the as-prepared CDs
and Cu-CDs was recorded. Most surprisingly, the peaks at 340 nm disappeared
after the doping of Cu2+ (Figure S2). We speculated it may result from the oxidation of nitrogen-doped
graphene quantum dots.28 Inspired by this,
Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) was used to investigate the change
of functional groups on the surface of the bare CDs and Cu-CDs. As
observed in Figure 3a, obvious absorption bands at 3444, 1462, and 1277 cm–1 were ascribed to −OH, COO–, and C–O stretching
vibrations, respectively. These observations confirmed the existence
of −OH and −COOH groups on the surface of Cu-CDs, which
was consistent with the XPS results of Cu-CDs. Compared to bare CDs,
the absorption band of the C–O group at 1277 cm–1 decreases in the FTIR spectrum of the as-prepared Cu-CDs, while
a increase in the intensity
of −OH groups at 1462 cm−1 increases choosing
the intensity of peak at 1400 cm−1 as a reference.
These changes implied that the −OH groups on the surface of
Cu-CDs were oxidized by Cu2+. To further reveal Cu2+ as an oxidant, the XPS high-resolution survey of Cu 2p was
used to reveal the composition of copper valence. As shown in Figure 3b, the peaks at about
934.0 and 953.7 eV correspond to the spin–orbit splitting of
Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively. The obvious
peaks at 932.2 were attributed to Cu+, which had further
illustrated the electron transport between CA and Cu2+.29 It was deduced that the electronic properties
and surface chemical reactivities of Cu-CDs might be improved because
of the introduction of Cu atoms.

(a) and XPS high-resolution
survey of Cu 2p (b).

2.2 Peroxidase-like Activity of Cu-CDs
In view of the peroxidase-like activity of CDs, whether the as-prepared
Cu-CDs possess the peroxidase-like activity was explored. As shown
in Figure S3, a clear absorption band at
425 nm could be observed, which belonged to the characteristic absorption
peak after oxidation of luminol. These results illustrated that Cu-CDs
also had the properties for catalysis. Additionally, in the absence
of Cu-CDs, the intensity of proposed CL sensing was relatively weak.
Therefore, it was assumed that the enhanced intensity of CL may be
ascribed to Cu-CD interaction with the reactants to form the intermediates,
resulting in the oxidation of luminol. On the basis of the results
of Merényi and co-workers,30 the
possible enhanced mechanism is summarized in Figure 4. First, luminol molecules transformed into
luminol anions under alkaline conditions. Second, luminol anion and
H2O2 were absorbed on the surface of Cu-CDs,
and H2O2 is activated by Cu2+/Cu+ via electron exchange to produce hydroxyl radicals (•OH). The formed •OH reacted with
HO2– and the luminol anion to facilitate
the formation of superoxide radicals and luminol radicals. Meanwhile,
an activated transition complex (Cu-CDs-luminol anion-O2•–) was formed through the charge transfer
reaction between luminal as the donor and Cu-CDs as the acceptor.
Dissolved oxygen was also absorbed at the surface of activated transition
complex and decomposed into O2•– by activated Cu-CDs-luminol anion-O2•–. Then, the resultant Cu-CDs-luminol anion-O2•– further oxidize luminol radicals to yield electronically excited
3-aminophthalate anions via electron exchange. Subsequent formation
of the excited 3-aminophthalate anions produces a strong CL emission
when it is relaxed to the ground state.9,31

Figure 4 Possible Mechanism
for the Cu-CDs-Luminol-H2O2 CL system.

Encouraged by the above observation,
the catalytic efficiency of
the as-prepared Cu-CDs under different pH and temperatures was explored.
After being treated in a wide range of pH values (5.0–11.0)
(Figure S4a) and temperatures (20–80
°C) (Figure S4b), the relative catalytic
activity of Cu-CDs did not change much. More importantly, the as-prepared
Cu-CDs exhibit superior peroxidase-like activity to HRP (Figure S4a,b), whose HRP activity dramatically
declined after incubation at temperatures greater than 40 °C
for 2 h or at pH values less than 5.0.32

2.3 CL Biosensor for H2O2
To achieve the best performance of Cu-CDs for the H2O2 assay, the effects of pH value, concentration
of luminol, and dosage of Cu-CDs were studied. As shown in Figure S5, the optimal pH value, concentration
of luminol, and dosage of Cu-CDs were measured to be 10.0, 0.75 mM,
and 0.5 mg/mL, respectively. Under the optimal conditions, an increased
CL intensity could be observed with increasing H2O2 concentrations (Figure 5a). As illustrated in Figure 5b, there was a good linear correlation between
the CL intensity at 425 nm and the H2O2 concentration
in the range of 7.5–150.0 μM, and the linear equation
is Y = 1.39X – 5.13, R2 = 0.998, where Y stands for
the CL intensity of the system and X stands for the
different concentrations of H2O2, and it was
estimated that the detection limit was about 1.48 μM (S/N =
3).

concentrations of H2O2. The concentrations of
H2O2 were 0, 7.5, 15.0, 30.0, 45.0, 75.0, 150.0,
225.0, 300.0, 450.0, 600.0, and 1125.0 μM (a). The linear plot
of the CL intensity at 425 nm vs different concentrations of H2O2 (b).

2.4 CL Biosensor for Glucose
On the basis
of the above results, sensitive detection of glucose through the H2O2-mediated oxidation reaction by Cu-CD-based CL
sensing is proposed. As shown in Figure 6a, the intensity at 425 nm of the CL system
increased gradually with an increase in the concentration of glucose.
The CL intensity is linearly proportional to the glucose concentration
in the range of 1.0–48.0 μM (Figure 6b), and the linear equation is A = 1.35B – 1.42, R2 = 0.999, where A is the CL intensity of the system
and B is the concentration of glucose. At the same
time, it was estimated that the detection limit was as low as 0.32
μM (S/N = 3), which is much lower than those previously reported
CL methods (Table 1).

Figure 6 CL spectra of the Cu-CD-based biosensor in the presence of different
concentrations of glucose, which were 0, 1.0, 4.0, 8.0, 12.0, 16.0,
24.0, 36.0, 48.0, 60.0, 80.0, and 110.0 μM (a). The linear plot

2.5 Selectivity of the CL Biosensor
To
test the selectivity of the proposed CL sensor based on Cu-CDs for
the glucose assay, the competition and control experiments were conducted.
As illustrated in Figure 7, even when the concentration of K+, Mg2+, mannose (Man), saccharose (Sac), xylose (Xyl), fructose (Fru),
and galactose (Gal) was 400 μM, no obvious change was observed.
Obvious changes can be observed after the addition of Fe2+, Mn2+, and ascorbic acid (Asc), which suggested that
Fe2+, Mn2+, and ascorbic acid may influence
the performance of glucose detection. Figure S6 shows that the interferences of the above interfering ions and Asc
were eliminated by adding 0.5 mM EDTA and 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-N-oxygen-piperidine, respectively. Therefore, the proposed
Cu-CD-based CL sensor has promising selectivity for the detection
of glucose.

of glucose and other interfering substances were 40.0 and 400.0 μM,
respectively).

2.6 CL Sensing
of Glucose in Serum Samples
On the basis of the proposed
CL sensor based on Cu-CDs for the sensitive
and selective assay for glucose, the applicability of the Cu-CD-based
CL sensor in complex matrixes was evaluated. Dilute human serum samples
were spiked with different concentrations of glucose and detected
by the proposed CL sensing. Table S1 shows
that the obtained recoveries of serum samples were in the range of
87.2–112.2%. In addition, the relative standard deviation was
less than 8.16% (n = 6). All observations further
approved the reliability and feasibility of developed CL sensing based
on Cu-CDs for detecting glucose in biological samples.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we proposed a facile and high-output
solid-phase synthesis
strategy for synthesizing Cu-doped CDs (Cu-CDs) using Cu(NO3)2·3H2O as the dopant. The electronic
properties and surface chemical reactivities of as-prepared Cu-CDs
had been substantially improved because of Cu doping, which was indeed
beneficial for the peroxidase-like activity of Cu-CDs. Moreover, the
prepared Cu-CDs exhibited good stability and outstanding peroxidase-like
activity under a wide range of pH values and temperatures. As a consequence,
the as-synthesized Cu-CDs were used as novel CL sensing catalysts
for the highly sensitive detection of glucose with a detection limit
as low as 0.32 μM. It is envisioned that the Cu-CD-based CL
sensing would be widely applied in sensing target analytes in the
future.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Glucose, mannose, saccharose,
xylose, fructose, galactose, and glucose oxidase were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich Co., Ltd. CA (99.5%), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30%, v/v), Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Na3PO4, NaH2PO4, NaOH, and HCl were purchased from Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd. (Shanghai,
China). All reagents are of analytical grade and were used without
further purification. Ultrapure water was prepared using a Millipore
water purification system (≥18 MΩ, Milli-Q, Millipore)
and was used in all of the runs.

4.2 Preparation
of Cu-CDs
Typically,
CA (1.0 g) and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O
(0.1 g) were mixed in a 25 mL round-bottom flask and heated to 230
°C for 20 min under vigorous stirring. The obtained mixture solution
was transferred into a little beaker and dissolved in 10 mL of water
after naturally cooling to room temperature. The pH of the above solution
was adjusted to 7.0 by adding NaOH. The obtained mixture was dialyzed
with a MD34 (3500 Da) dialysis tube for 48 h to remove the small fragments.
The Cu-CD powder was obtained using a rotary evaporator. Then, the
obtained Cu-CDs were soluble in water and preserved at 4 °C for
the following experiments.

For the preparation of CDs, CA (1.0
g) was mixed in a 25 mL round-bottom flask and heated to 230 °C
for 20 min under vigorous stirring. Other experimental steps were
conducted similar to the preparation of Cu-CDs as mentioned above.

4.3 Quantum Yield Measurements
The photoluminescence
quantum yield of fluorescent CDs was calculated using the following
equation  

Quinine sulfate (ΦR = 0.54) was dissolved in 0.1 M H2SO4 [refractive
index (η of 1.33)], and CDs were dissolved in deionized water
(η = 1.33). Here, Φ and I are the quantum
yield and integrated emission intensity and η and A are the refractive index and optical density. The subscript R refers
to the reference fluorophore of the known quantum yield.

4.4 Characterization
A Cary 60 UV–vis
spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, USA) was used for absorption measurement.
The CL spectra were recorded using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer
(Agilent Technologies, USA) under the optimal conditions: a voltage
of 650 V and an emission slit of 10 nm, respectively. FTIR spectroscopy
study was conducted in KBr pellets using a PerkinElmer FTIR spectrophotometer
(PerkinElmer, USA). TEM images were recorded using a Tecnai G2 F20TEM
(FEI, USA) operating at 200 kV. XPS spectra were recorded with a Thermo
ESCALAB 250Xi Multitechnique Surface Analysis (Thermo, USA). X-ray
diffraction analyses were carried out on a Rigaku D/max 2500 v/pc
X-ray powder diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 0.154 nm).

4.5 CL Biosensor for H2O2 and Glucose Detection
In a typical
experiment, 100 μL
of Cu-CDs (1.0 mg/mL) and 100 μL of luminol (5 mM) were added
in 700 μL of PBS buffer solution (25 mM, pH = 9.0). Then, H2O2 with concentrations of 7.5, 15.0, 30.0, 45.0,
75.0, 150.0, 225.0, 300.0, 450.0, 600.0, and 1125.0 μM were
mixed with the above mixture, respectively. The CL was recorded immediately,
and the emission intensity at 425 nm was used to evaluate the assay
performance.

For glucose detection, 50 μL of glucose oxidase
(1 mg/mL) was incubated with 50 μL of glucose (the concentrations
of glucose were 0, 1.0, 4.0, 8.0, 12.0, 16.0, 24.0, 36.0, 48.0, 60.0,
80.0, and 110.0 μM, respectively) at 37 °C for 30 min.
Then, the obtained solution was added to the mixture containing 100
μL of Cu-CDs (1 mg/mL), 700 μL of PBS buffer (25 mM, pH
= 9.0), and 100 μL of luminol (5 mM). The CL generated at 425
nm was used to evaluate the assay performance.

All the measurements
in this section were performed three times,
and the standard deviation was plotted as the error bar.

4.6 CL Biosensor for the Detection of Glucose
in the Real Sample
To evaluate the practicality of the presented
CL method, the CL biosensor-based Cu-CD was applied to determine the
level of glucose in the human serum sample obtained from the No. 5
Hospital of Guilin (Guangxi, China). The obtained serum was diluted
with 20 μL of H2O, and then 500 μL of Ba(OH)2 (0.08 M) and 500 μL of ZnSO4 (0.1 M) were
added. After vortex oscillations and centrifugation for 10 min, these
samples were diluted in PBS buffer (25 mM, pH 9.0), and then they
were spiked with standard solutions containing different concentrations
of glucose. The final solution was analyzed by the CL biosensor-based
Cu-CDs.
