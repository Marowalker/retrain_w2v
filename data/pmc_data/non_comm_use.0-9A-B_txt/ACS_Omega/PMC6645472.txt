Squalene–hopene cyclase catalyzes the cyclization of squalene
to hopanoids. A previous study has identified a network of tunnels
in the protein, where water molecules have been indicated to move.
Blocking these tunnels by site-directed mutagenesis was found to change
the activation entropy of the catalytic reaction from positive to
negative with a concomitant lowering of the activation enthalpy. As
a consequence, some variants are faster and others are slower than
the wild type (wt) in vitro under optimal reaction conditions for
the wt. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been
performed for the wt and the variants to investigate how the mutations
affect the protein structure and the water flow in the enzyme, hypothetically
influencing the activation parameters. Interestingly, the tunnel-obstructing
variants are associated with an increased flow of water in the active
site, particularly close to the catalytic residue Asp376. MD simulations
with the substrate present in the active site indicate that the distance
for the rate-determining proton transfer between Asp376 and the substrate
is longer in the tunnel-obstructing protein variants than in the wt.
On the basis of the previous experimental results and the current
MD results, we propose that the tunnel-obstructing variants, at least
partly, could operate by a different catalytic mechanism, where the
proton transfer may have contributions from a Grotthuss-like mechanism.

Introduction
Terpenes comprise the
most diversified class of natural products
of high importance for life.1 The key to
the myriad of observed multicyclic products is a terpene cyclase-catalyzed
carbocationic polycyclization cascade of a prefolded linear polyisoprene
substrate that is chaperoned in essentially one reactive conformation.
The stereospecific terpene cyclization in the hydrophobic active site
is initiated by either phosphate release (class I mechanism) or protonation
of the terminal isoprene or oxirane (class II mechanism), which yields
a carbocation that propagates in the molecule upon ring closure through
carbon–carbon bond formation.2 The
final carbocation is quenched by either deprotonation or water addition
depending on the availability of a suitable base and the spatial organization
of water in the active site.3

The
cyclization step and subsequent product modification by tailoring
enzymes determine the bioactivities of terpenes that range from mediating
cell membrane rigidity, defense, to signaling.4,5 Triterpenes
constitute one important class of terpenes with applications as medicines
and fine chemical synthons.6 The potent
antibacterial, anticancer, and antiviral bioactivities displayed by
some cyclic terpenes,6−8 as well as their high synthetic potential as new
biofuels,9,10 have spurred increasing interest from the
biotechnological and chemical industries.

Stereospecific carbon–carbon
bond formation is of high importance
in synthetic organic chemistry and biocatalysis.11,12 Terpene cyclases are of high synthetic interest13−15 as they enable
stereospecific polycyclizations that are challenging to achieve by
synthetic chemistry.6 Therefore, an enhanced
understanding of the reaction mechanism displayed by these fascinating
enzymes would be beneficial for chemical and biotechnological industries.
Squalene–hopene cyclase (SHC) has served as a model system
to enhance our understanding of triterpene biosynthetic machineries.
SHC converts the linear molecule squalene to the pentacyclic triterpenes
hopene (Figure 1) and
hopanol.

Figure 1 Conversion from the linear squalene (A) to a prefolded geometry
(B) in the active site of SHC in the polycyclization reaction to hopene
(C).

SHC is a monotopic enzyme16 with a hydrophobic
channel toward the membrane helix that allows for acquisition of the
hydrophobic substrate. The membrane-binding region of the enzyme is
highly lipophilic, and it is submerged in the nonpolar region of the
membrane (Figure 2).

and membrane association of squalene–hopene cyclase

stick) is shown in the active site. The membrane-binding helix is
shown in red. (B) The protein inserted into a membrane patch, the
substrate is located in the hydrophobic channel (green, stick).

The substrate is guided into the
prefolded conformation for ring
closure when entering the active site, and the shape of the active
site stabilizes the substrate in a prefolded arrangement for the polycyclization
to take place. The cyclization cascade is then initiated by protonation
of a terminal isoprene double bond from the catalytic residue Asp376
(Figure 1), which yields
a carbocation that is stabilized from premature quenching by hydrophobic
side chains in the active site.14 The pKa of Asp376 is modulated by a hydrogen bond
to the protonated His451 and by the close vicinity to the negatively
charged Asp374:Asp377 pair.18 The latter
has also been postulated to stabilize the protonated substrate.19

In a study performed by Schwab et al.,20 a higher mobility of the membrane-binding region
was identified
when a ligand was bound to the active site. However, there was no
significant change of the narrowest part of the hydrophobic channel,
either in fluctuations or the absolute structure.

The polycyclization
reaction is highly exergonic and the formation
of hopene theoretically releases about 48 kcal/mol.20 It has been suggested that this energy release affects
the structure of the protein in such a way that the hydrophobic channel
is expanded enough to accommodate the bulky product.17 Others have advocated that energy is released and dissipated
much faster than the timescale of the necessary conformational changes.20,21

A previous study by Syrén et al. detected a network
of tunnels
leading from the active site to the surface of the protein through
an in silico CAVER22 analysis.23 It was suggested that expulsion of water molecules
from the active site to the bulk could compensate for the entropic
cost of prefolding the substrate in one reactive conformation.23 The identified highest ranked tunnels (from
CAVER) were obstructed with rational in silico protein design by introducing
bulky amino acids at selected positions. In vitro experimental kinetic
characterization showed that the variants display significantly altered
temperature dependencies of catalysis and entropies and enthalpies
of activation compared to those of the wild type (wt), suggesting
the importance of unobstructed water flow for the performed catalytic
reaction (Table 1).
All variants, except for the control mutation, showed decreased activation
enthalpy (ΔH‡) and activation
entropy (ΔS‡) compared to
those of the wt. However, the exact mechanism by which these mutations
affect the cyclization reaction remained unknown.

The impact of water within
enzyme structures has been shown to
have important functions in the catalytic activities of enzymes.24,25 It has been found that water molecules can improve the steric fit
of ligand binding, mediate hydrogen bonds between enzyme and active
site, and affect interaction energies.24 Product release can be facilitated by refilling the active site
by a flow of water molecules from the bulk solution upon product release.26 It has previously been suggested that a network
of water molecules within tunnels that connect the active site to
the bulk water on the outside of the protein might be a general feature
of all enzymes to enable protonation, as well as rehydrating and dehydrating
the active site during product release and substrate binding.27 In a study by Schiebel et al.,27 mutations were introduced in water channels in saFAbI (Staphylococcus aureus enoyl-acyl carrier protein
reductase) and were found to affect the catalytic efficiency of the
enzyme. These mutations were suggested to hinder the flow of water
out from the active site. It was additionally argued that because
the mutations are at a distance from the active site, it is more likely
to be global processes that are disturbed than local processes in
the active site.

The aim of the current study was to further
investigate the previously
suggested water tunnels in SHC23 to study
the movements of water molecules between the active site and the surface
of SHC in more detail, and to analyze how the introduction of bulky
amino acids, predicted to block the water tunnels, affect the flow
of water molecules in the active site. Therefore, we investigated
the dynamics of the tunnels and water flow in the active site during
sub-microsecond MD simulations of the wt as well as different protein
variants.

The tunnel-blocking variants were found to have an
increased flow
of water around the catalytic residue Asp376 in the active site compared
to that in the wt. The higher water flow is associated with a larger
distance for the proton transfer between Asp376 and the substrate
for the rate-determining proton transfer step of the catalytic reaction.
However, there is no correlation between the protonation distance
and the activation free energy, and we propose that the designed protein
variants function through a different mechanism to that of the wt;
one that at least partly could be dependent on Grotthuss-like proton
transfer.

Results and Discussion
The stability of the protein
structure without a membrane has previously
been established in a simulation by Schwab et al.20 However, a recent study of membrane protein has indicated
that both membrane and protein need to be considered explicitly to
reproduce the hydration dynamics of the system.28 Therefore, the membrane was included in our model to account
for potential contributions from water associated to the membrane.
The protein structures (both 1UMP and 2SQC) were found to be stable for the full-length simulation at 330 K
in water (see SI for root-mean square deviation
(RMSD) plots) with and without the membrane patch.

Visual inspection
of the protein structures superposed on top of
the wt shows that the protein structures stay intact, and do not change
significantly over the course of the simulations, for any of the protein
variants. An analysis of the RMSDs was performed on averaged structures
from the trajectories. The RMSD values for the backbone of the mutated
protein variants compared to that of the wt were S38W: 0.510 Å;
S168F: 0.385 Å; S168W: 1.270 Å; F605W: 0.405 Å; and
V440F: 0.509 Å. The mutations do not introduce any major visible
changes in the protein three-dimensional structure, as is depicted
in Figure 5.

Protein Flexibility
An analysis of the B-factors for
each amino acid residue in the protein detected only small variations
in the flexibility between the different variants. However, some parts
of the enzyme are more flexible than others. Long distance effects
of introduced mutations on the mobility of protein loops have previously
been discussed.29

The membrane-binding
region (residues 216–234) was found to display high B-factors
and thus seems to be flexible in comparison to other parts of the
enzyme (Figure 4).
This is in agreement with a study by Wendt et al.,30 where the membrane-binding helix was described as the most
mobile region, based on the variations of the B-factors from the crystal
structure. There were some differences in the membrane-binding helix
between the different protein variants (Figures 3 and 4). For one of the variants, F605W, the helix is
slightly twisted compared to those of the other variants (Figure 3). Interestingly,
this variant was the fastest at all studied temperatures among the
variants analyzed by Syrén et al. (Table 1). The rate increase of F605W is probably
connected to other factors, but, at least, the conformational change
does not seem to have a negative impact on the catalytic conversion.
In all variants, the N- and C-terminal regions show high flexibility,
as could be expected for terminal regions of the protein chain.

Figure 4 Investigated variants show small variations in B-factors. B-factors
from MD simulations are given for the wt (red) and protein variants
(blue). For reference, wt data is plotted in each subplot. One highly
mobile region of the protein is constituted by the residues around
the membrane-binding region (residues 216–234). The analysis
shown was performed on the last 100 ns of the 150 ns trajectory.

Previous studies have shown that
there is a relationship between
the activity of an enzyme and the rigidity of the residues in the
active site. Some flexibility of the residues in the active site is
necessary for the enzyme to perform its catalytic function throughout
the catalytic cycle.31 An increased stiffness
of residues has been associated with a decrease of activity for the
barnase enzyme.32 Focusing on the flexibility
of the amino acids in the DXDD motif (Asp374, Asp376, and Asp377),
which is involved in the initial protonation step,33 some minor differences in B-factors can be noted (Table S2 in SI), but the changes do not follow
the trends of the kinetic behavior of the experimental results. Thus,
our analysis indicates that the variations in B-factors of the DXDD
motif cannot explain the measured experimental differences between
the mutated variants for this enzyme.

Substrate Entrance and
Product Release
The timescales
of substrate entrance and product release were investigated over the
MD trajectories. Simulations with the substrate in the hydrophobic
channel (Figure 2)
show that the substrate can move through the channel during this time
frame. In simulations with the substrate located in the hydrophobic
channel at the start of the simulation, the substrate leaves the channel
and moves into the membrane.

Wendt et al. suggested that the
product leaves through the same channel as that through which the
substrate enters.19 There are two mobile
loops attached to the membrane, and the required widening of the channel
could occur by membrane fluctuations.30 However, in this study, the product does not leave the active site
during the simulation (even when extended to 180 ns). It is likely
that the hydrophobic channel needs to expand to accommodate the bulky
pentacyclic hopene for the transport from the active site to the membrane.
To simulate the heat that is released during the reaction, MD was
also run at a higher temperature (350 K) to allow for a possible energy-dependent
widening of the channel. However, the product does not leave the active
site during the course of the simulation at elevated temperature.
It is difficult to assign the significance of this result, because
the higher temperature may not reproduce the effect of the energy
dissipation, and any associated conformational change, that results
from the energy release from the reaction. Furthermore, the timescale
of the simulation may not be sufficient for the event to take place.

Analysis of Water Tunnels
Visual inspection of the
trajectories shows that no stationary water molecules exist in the
active site, or in close proximity to the active site on the timescale
of 0.1 μs, independently of whether the protein is empty, has
the substrate in the hydrophobic channel or active site, or the product
is in the active site. There is also a spontaneous exchange of water
molecules between the protein interior and the bulk water.

The
tunnels identified in the CAVER analysis (data not shown) clearly
display a dynamic behavior, and the tunnels open and close over the
time frame of these simulations. Because CAVER analysis does not reveal
if there are water molecules moving or residing in these tunnels,
an additional streamline analysis was performed.

Streamline
Analysis
A streamline analysis performed
on the SHC wt shows that water moves continuously through certain
regions of the protein (Figure 5) when simulated in a water
box. The most intense water flow takes place in the region in and
around the active site. The streamline is a curve that is at any point
tangent to the velocity (or flow) field. The streamline describes
the path of a massless particle in a flow field. The flow field in
our work is constructed from the direction and magnitude of the fastest
water diffusion component in each volume cell. The diffusion parameters
are obtained by analyzing and averaging the motions of all water molecules
throughout the time frame of a simulation, as described in the SI. Thus, each streamline represents the most
probable path of a water molecule in a simulation. For clarity, we
show only streamlines originating in the cells with a magnitude and
anisotropy of diffusion higher than the predefined threshold.

Figure 5 Streamline
analysis showing the flow of water (red lines) between
the bulk solution and the active site. (A) Streamlines through the
whole protein with the substrate in the active site. (B) Streamlines
visualized through a clipping plane through the empty protein cut
in half (protein not included for visualization).

Interestingly, the streamline analyses of the (i) empty protein,
(ii) protein with prefolded substrate, (iii) protonated substrate,
and (vi) product show that water molecules are moving in and out of
the active site during the entire modeled reaction sequence independent
of active site occupation. Figure 6 shows the flow of water in the active site of the
empty protein as well when it contains substrate, protonated substrate,
and product. The flow of water is highest when the active site is
empty, and the lowest flow is observed in the presence of the bulky
product.

Figure 6 Streamlines in (A) empty protein, (B) protein with substrate (green)
in the active site, (C) protonated substrate (green), and (D) protein
with product (blue) in the active site.

The rate-determining step of this reaction is the initial
protonation
of the substrate, as indicated by a significant deuterium kinetic
isotope effect.23 Interestingly, the streamline
analysis shows a difference in the flow of water between the systems
with the protonated and unprotonated substrate in the active site
(Figure 6).

Syrén
et al.,23 on the basis
of their CAVER analysis, introduced mutations to block the tunnels
and thereby hypothetically hinder the flow of water to and from the
active site. The temperature-dependent kinetic properties of these
protein variants were determined experimentally and analyzed by means
of Eyring transition state theory (Table 1). It was found that all tunnel-blocking
mutations resulted in a lowering of the activation enthalpy (ΔH‡) and a lowering of the activation entropy
(ΔS‡) compared to those of
the wt, whereas some variants were faster and some slower than the
wt at the normal reaction temperature (328 K).

To investigate
the impact of the introduced mutations on the global
water dynamics, a streamline analysis was initially performed with
the S38W variant. Introducing a tryptophan at this tunnel lining position
obstructs one of the (by CAVER) highest ranked tunnels in the protein,23 which is associated with profound experimental
effects on the temperature dependence, and with that the activation
parameters of catalysis (Table 1).23 Changing S38 to a tryptophan
in silico forces water to move around the side chain of the bulkier
tryptophan, which further impacts the motion of water molecules in
the solvated active site (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Streamline analysis on (A) the wt and (B) S38W, indicating
the
flow of water in the active site. The substrate (squalene) is indicated
in green, and S38 (A) and S38W (B) in yellow. The flow of water is
altered near the introduced mutation.

The streamline analysis was subsequently performed on all
of the
protein variants; Figure 8 displays the flow of water in the active site for the different
protein variants. As the activation parameters (ΔH‡, ΔS‡, and ΔG‡) of the different
protein variants were found to differ in the experimental study,23 we focused the analysis on the region in the
active site where the rate-determining step occurs, i.e., around the
catalytic residue Asp376 and the substrate, as shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Streamlines around the
substrate and the catalytic residue Asp376
(blue) in the wt, S38W, S168F, S168W, F605W, and V440F. The substrate
(green) stays in the active site during the simulation. Each mutated
residue is also indicated in each subplot. Gray: protein backbone.

The streamline analysis of the
wt and variants (Figure 8) shows that there are changes
in the flow of water in the active site. In particular, there is an
increased flow of water between the substrate and the catalytic residue
Asp376 in S38W, S168F/S168W, and F605W compared to that in the wt
and V440F. This is surprising, considering that the mutations were
designed to hinder the flow of water in the tunnels. The streamline
analysis indeed shows that the water paths in the vicinities of the
mutated residues are altered, leading to changes in active site solvation.

Analysis of Diffusion Constants in the Active Site
The streamline
analysis images (Figure 8) confirm that there are more water molecules
moving in the region between the catalytic residue and the substrate
in the mutated protein variants (except for control mutation V440F).
An investigation of the distribution of the diffusion constants in
this region around the catalytic residue shows further differences
between the wt and protein variants. Figure 9 shows how the distributions of diffusion
coefficients change for the wt and each protein variant in a 5.5 Å
region around Asp376.

Figure 9 Distribution of diffusion coefficients in a 5.5 Å
region around
the catalytic residue for the wt and protein variants (blue). The
distribution of the wt is also inserted (red) for facilitated comparison
with each protein variant.

From Figure 9, it
can be concluded that the wt and control mutation (V440F) have generally
lower diffusion in the investigated region compared to that of the
mutated protein variants F605W, S168F/W, and S38W. Although the Gibbs
free energy of activation varies among the mutated variants, they
all have in common that they have a much lower activation entropy
than that of the wt (Table 1). The S38W variant, which has its peak for the distribution
most shifted toward the higher diffusion coefficient, has the most
negative activation entropy. This is also the protein variant with
the highest Gibbs free energy barrier at 328 K.

The introduced
mutations do not only alter the location of the
water streams in the active site, but also the diffusion in the catalytic
region. Looking at the median values for the diffusion coefficients
in Figure 12, the
trend is sustained independently of the chosen cut-off region around
Asp376 for the different protein variants. There is generally a lower
flow in the active site of the wt and control mutation (V440F) compared
to that of the other protein variants (Figure 10). This is an interesting observation that
shows how altered water access pathways by enzyme design induce a
reconfigured water flow.

radius values around the catalytic residue for the different protein
variants.

Amount of Water around
the Catalytic Residue and the Protonation
Distance
An analysis of the number of water molecules within
5 Å of the catalytic residue Asp376 over the course of the simulation
confirms that the wt and control mutation (V440F) on average have
fewer water molecules surrounding the substrate than the designed
variants (Figure 11). The average number of water molecules within 5 Å of Asp376
is also higher in the variants as shown in Figure 11.

Figure 11 Number of water molecules within 5 Å of
the catalytic residue
Asp376 over the trajectory. The dotted black lines in all subplots
are the average value for the wt. The averages for each variant are
stated in the legend of each subplot.

The water molecules in the active site were hypothesized
to affect
the rate-determining proton transfer; if there are water molecules
between the catalytic residue and the terminal isoprene group, the
direct proton transfer from Asp376 to the substrate will be hindered.
To quantify this effect, the distance between the acidic proton of
Asp376 and the carbon on the substrate that receives the proton was
compared for the different variants (Figure S2 in SI). We will refer to this distance as the “protonation
distance”, although the actual distance of proton transfer
is shorter by ca. 1.1 Å (the typical distance of a C–H
bond).

The effect of the distance between the catalytic residue
and the
terminal isoprene group of the substrate on the catalytic efficiency
of SHC has previously been investigated on the basis of shorter MD
simulations.34,35 Hammer et al. identified a correlation
between the fraction of structures with a protonation distance of
2.9 Å or shorter and the catalytic activity for different unnatural
substrates.35 However, a similar correlation
for the natural substrate and the different variants could not be
found herein. The variations in the protonation distance along MD
trajectories for the different protein variants are displayed in Figure 12.

Figure 12 Protonation distance for the wt and protein variants. The dotted
black lines in all figures are the average value for the wt. The averages
for each variant are stated in the legend of each subplot.

The different plots of Figure 12 show that the protonation distance on average
is shorter
in the wt and the control mutation V440F than in the other variants.
Furthermore, the figure clearly demonstrates the importance of a longer
simulation time for this type of analysis. The first 20–30
ns are not representative of the state that the system occupies for
the remaining simulation time in the majority of these trajectories
(V440 changes its behavior after a longer time, ca. 80 ns). Thus,
in the subsequent analysis we removed the first 50 ns and used the
last 100 ns for statistics.

Table 2 indicates
a qualitative correlation between the average number of water molecules
around Asp376 and the average protonation distance for the different
variants. Thus, it seems that on average, the larger protonation distance
in the designed variants is due to intercalation of water between
Asp376 and the substrate.

a The average values were calculated
from the last 100 ns of the simulation trajectories.

b The V440F protonation distance becomes
on average longer after around 80 ns, and therefore the average protonation
distance is likely to be overestimated and ΔGNAC underestimated for V440F in the table (see Figure 12).

On the basis of the concept of near
attack conformers (NAC),36,37 the free energy of
activation for the catalytic reaction has a contribution
from the free energy of NAC-formation (ΔGNAC), i.e., the system has to pass a NAC before it can reach
the transition state, and the free energy cost of reaching the NAC
is a fraction of the total activation free energy. ΔGNAC is computed from the fraction of structures
labeled as NACs (pNAC) by ΔGNAC = −RT ln(pNAC). We have previously shown38,39 that ΔGNAC can be used in enzyme
design to rank the catalytic efficiencies of different protein variants
for a particular reaction. Herein, we define the NAC as a structure
where the distance between the acidic hydrogen of Asp376 and the accepting
carbon of the substrate is within the sum of the van der Waals radii
of the interacting atoms. Hammer et al. used a similar definition
in their study of unnatural substrates, but they used the term transition
state structure instead of NAC to denote the relevant structures.35

Studies of interactions in solid crystals
have found that the mean
non-bonding H–C distance of organic compounds is close to 3.0
Å, and we used this distance as an estimate of the H–C
van der Waals distance and the NAC criterion in our analysis (the
sum of the Bondi van der Waals radii of H and C gives 2.9 Å).40 However, as this criterion gives a very low
NAC frequency for the protein variants that results in low precision,
we have, for comparison, also used a slightly longer H–C distance
(3.5 Å) as the NAC criterion (Table 2).

The relatively short average protonation
distance and the relatively
high frequency of NACs reported in Table 2 for the wt and the control mutant are consistent
with a direct proton transfer between Asp376 and the substrate. On
the other hand, the tunnel-blocking variants consistently have a larger
average protonation distance and a much lower, in most cases negligible,
NAC frequency; observations that seem to preclude a direct proton
transfer mechanism in these variants. There is no overall correlation
between ΔGNAC and the free energy
of activation for the catalytic reaction because some of the designed
variants are faster than the wt and others are slower at 328 K. On
the other hand, a low NAC frequency was found to be associated with
a negative activation entropy; the designed variants in all cases
have a negative activation entropy whereas it is positive for the
wt. One plausible explanation for these observations is that the tunnel-obstructing
variants operate to some extent by a different mechanism than that
of the wt. It can be noted that using the longer H–C distance
as the NAC criterion, as expected, decreases ΔGNAC, but the relative difference in ΔGNAC (ΔΔGNAC) between
variants shows similar variations as with the shorter H–C distance.
Thus, the qualitative interpretation of the results is not sensitive
to the NAC criterion.

We can speculate that the variants, in
addition to direct proton
transfer, can operate via a Grotthuss-like mechanism where the transfer
of a proton from Asp376 to the substrate is mediated via one or more
adjacent water molecules. Such a mechanism will lead to a lower activation
entropy as it will require the positioning of a water molecule during
the proton transfer, but it could reduce the activation enthalpy,
and in principle, also the activation free energy. With the exception
of S168W (where the deuterium kinetic isotope effect (DKIE) was 1.0),
the observed DKIE of the wt and the variants lies in the range 1.6–2.1
(Table 1); a DKIE of
this size is consistent with both a direct proton transfer or a Grotthuss-like
proton transfer, and thus the DKIE does not provide a method to distinguish
between the two mechanisms.41,42 In this context, it
should be mentioned that a previous study reported an altered reaction
mechanism by introducing mutations in a tunnel in haloalkane dehalogenase
LinB.43

The introduced mutations
could also affect the pKa of Asp376, and
thereby indirectly affect the reaction
rate. The most plausible reasons behind a pKa change are a change in the solvation of Asp376 or in the
positions of the surrounding residues; in particular, the positions
of His451, Asp374, and Asp377 and their protonation states are expected
to be important for the pKa of Asp376.
However, it should be noted that there is not likely to be a simple
relationship between the pKa of Asp376
and the reaction rate. The barrier for proton transfer from Asp376
will decrease with decreasing pKa, but
if the pKa is much lower than pH, only
a tiny fraction of Asp376 will be protonated and the reaction rate
will decrease significantly (the reaction rate is expected to reach
a maximum at a pH close to the pKa).44 Furthermore, the barrier is not only dependent
on the pKa but also on the distance that
the proton has to be transferred, and mutations that change the pKa may simultaneously change this distance. Still,
it would be very interesting to experimentally investigate how the
activation parameters and the DKIE of the wt and the variants vary
with the pH. Unfortunately, computations of pKa values of systems of this complexity are still affected with
too great uncertainties to be directly applicable.

Water molecules
have previously been recognized to play several
different important roles in cell biology.45 They impact the binding of ligands to receptors and can determine
ligand selectivity.46 A key role of water
in the reprotonation of catalytically active amino acids has been
acknowledged, and Wendt et al. proposed that the protonation of the
catalytic acid in squalene–hopene cyclase from A. acidocaldarius likely occurs through a tunnel,
identified in the crystal structure,30 linking
the catalytic aspartate with the bulk solvent via a chain of six hydrogen-bonded
water molecules. Mutations of similar proton channels that mediate
solvent-assisted “Grotthuss-like” proton transfers were
shown to affect the catalytic activity of other enzymes, such as the
enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase from S. aureus, where the catalytic efficacy was decreased 10000-fold in the water
channel variants compared to that in the wt.27

Moreover, water molecules are prone to intercepting highly-reactive
intermediates to tune product distribution, which is of high relevance
for terpene cyclases that form several carbocations in their catalyzed
polycyclization reactions. A structural role of water molecules in
terpene cyclase active sites has been discussed in light of a sesquiterpene
cyclase from Aspergillus terreus. Water
molecules lining the hydrophobic active site were suggested to direct
product distribution by contributing to prefolding of the substrate.47

This study has provided an enhanced understanding
of active site
solvation throughout the reaction sequence of SHC. It has also shown
how the introduced mutations, which were designed to obstruct the
water paths leading to the active site, change the flow of water in
the active site. The importance of water dynamics has also been studied
recently by David et al.;48 they introduced
mutations in water channels that altered the dynamics of water access
to the active site.

Surprisingly, the enzyme variants with obstructed
water tunnels
enable an increased flow of water in the active site by forcing water
molecules to change path. This leads to an increase in the distance
the proton has to travel in the rate-determining proton transfer step
of the catalytic reaction. These variants, in contrast to the wt,
all have a negative activation entropy, whereas their activation free
energy varies, and for some variants, it is lower than that for the
wt at 328 K.

We suggest that these observations can be explained
by changes
in the protonation step of the reaction mechanism in the variants,
which may partially operate by a Grotthuss-like proton transfer. The
SHC system seems to be very complex, and the previously identified
changes in activation parameters are likely to arise from a combination
of actions in the enzyme, and probably not solely from these identified
changes in water flow with the associated altered protonation distance.
It is possible that the introduced mutations also affect other global
processes not investigated in this study. Further investigations will
be necessary to fully understand the complex catalytic mechanism of
SHC. In particular, we foresee that an investigation on how changes
in pH affect the activation parameters and the deuterium kinetic isotope
effect of the wt and variants can help elucidate variations in the
mechanism.

Conclusions
Water molecules were
found to move continuously between the bulk
solution and the active site through specific paths in the protein;
there are water molecules in the active site before the entering of
the substrate and throughout the reaction. Protein variants previously
designed to obstruct water paths leading to the active site by the
introduction of bulky side chains were found to change the water path
locally at the substitution site. Interestingly, these variants were
found to be associated with an increased flow of
water in the active site, particularly in the vicinity of the catalytic
amino acid Asp376. Simulations with the substrate present in the active
site indicate that the distance for the rate-determining proton transfer
between Asp376 and the substrate is longer in the tunnel-obstructing
protein variants than that in the wt and the control mutation V440F.
However, the NAC analysis shows no correlation between the protonation
distance and the activation free energy of the catalytic reaction
at the simulation temperature. The common denominator for the tunnel-obstructing
variants is that they have a negative activation entropy, whereas
it is positive for the wt. On the basis of the observations of this
study, we speculate that these variants could operate by a Grotthuss-like
proton transfer in the rate-determining step, which is consistent
with both the negative activation entropy and a larger protonation
distance. Further experimental and theoretical studies will be needed
to increase the mechanistic understanding of this complex enzyme.

Methods
To investigate patterns of water movement in the protein, MD simulations
were conducted with AMBER49 on the bacterial
SHC from A. acidocaldarius (PDB entries: 2SQC(30) and 1UMP(17)). The monomeric form (chain A) of the
protein was selected for in silico analysis. The SHC structure has
been reported as a dimer30 in its native
form, but it has been suggested that the dimerization might be of
transient nature.20

Both crystal
structures 2SQC and 1UMP contain
an analogue of the substrate crystallized with the protein.
The analogue is either localized in the channel in (2SQC) or in the active
site (1UMP).
The analogue molecules were replaced by squalene and hopene molecules
(Figure 1) in preparation
for the MD simulations.

The monotopic membrane protein SHC was
attached to an 80 Å
× 80 Å palmitoyl oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) membrane,
constructed in visual molecular dynamics50 (with charmm36 parameters). The binding residues (residues 216–234)
were manually inserted into the membrane (Figure 2). All molecules (both POPC and associated
water molecules) from the membrane that were within 3 Å of the
protein were removed to avoid steric clashes.

The water molecules
from the crystal structure were retained, and
additional TIP3P water molecules were added by Leap51 in a box extending 10 Å around the edge of the protein–membrane
complex. In total, about forty thousand water molecules were included
in the simulation box.

Introduction of Mutations
Mutations
were introduced
manually by replacing the affected residue in each PDB-file, and processing
each file with Leap, to investigate whether introduction of bulky
amino acids in place of the native residue with a small side chain
changes the flow of water through the previously identified tunnels23 in the protein.

Protein variants included
mutations of S38, S168, and F605 to tryptophan and phenylalanine (S38W,
S168F, S168W, and F605W) that block three of the previously identified
tunnels23 in the enzyme. In addition, we
introduced a control mutation V440F (Figure 13). V440 is considered to be neither in the
active site nor in a tunnel, and the kinetic behavior of the V440F
mutant is similar to that of the wt.

Figure 13 (A) Location of introduced mutations
S38 (yellow), S168 (orange),
F605 (cyan), and control mutation V440 (purple). The substrate, squalene,
is indicated in green. S38, S168, and F605 are considered to be in
the second sphere of the active site, V440 is outside the active site.

and the substrate.

MD Simulations
The simulations were performed with
the AMBER software using force field ff14SB52 for the proteins, lipid1453 for the membrane,
and generalized Amber force field (GAFF)54 for the ligands. Parameters for the GAFF force field for the substrate
and product were developed with antechamber,51 see SI for details. The simulations were
around 150 ns long.

Some simulations were extended for up to
300 ns to study the processes during a longer time frame. Five parallel
simulations of 20 ns length each were performed for further investigation
of the sample space for the wt and the S38W mutant.

An additional
simulation at higher temperature (350 K) of the protein
with the product in the active site was performed to analyze whether
the conformation of the hydrophobic channel would be more inclined
to change to a wider diameter in order for the product to be able
to be released from the active site to the membrane. A previous study20 suggested that due to the high flexibility of
the channel, it is likely that it also serves as an exit channel for
release of the bulky product.

Simulations were performed with
(i) the empty enzyme, (ii) the
substrate (squalene) in different locations of the substrate entrance
channel, (iii) squalene in the active site, for each of the protein
variants, (iv) protonated squalene in the active site, and (v) product
in the active site. More information about which PDB structure was
used for each case can be found in the SI, Table S1. Post processing of the trajectories was performed using
the CPPTRAJ program55 in AmberTools.56

The stability of the protein outside its
native environment of
a bilayer lipid membrane was also investigated (under the same conditions
as when the membrane was included, see SI for a more detailed description).

Water Analysis
The network of water tunnels in SHC
was further investigated in silico with the use of different computational
tools. CAVER22 was developed to identify
tunnels and pores in proteins. It was originally used for investigating
these features in crystal structures or other static images of macromolecules.
As CAVER is not measuring water dynamics, we complemented it with
a method developed by Vassiliev et al.57,58 to track the
flow of water through a protein using streamline visualization of
diffusion tensor fields. Previous water diffusion pathway studies
have focused on proteins that have well-defined channels and a more
simple geometry than SHC, such as aquaporins.59−62 A recent study also investigated
water dynamics in a de novo tunnel.63 The
data analysis technique applied in this study locates areas of highly
anisotropic motions of water molecules from the simulation. It finds
the most likely pathways of water diffusion in the protein based on
the water motions detected in the MD simulations.

The streamline
analysis was conducted on the 150 ns trajectories to investigate how
the water molecules move in the enzyme. The water movements in the
empty enzyme were compared to water movements in the enzyme with substrate,
protonated substrate, and product in the active site. Water movements
were also compared between the wt and the mutated protein variants.
Details of streamline analysis are described in the SI.
