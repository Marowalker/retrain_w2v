We have explored orally effective
thyrotropin-releasing hormone
(TRH) mimetics, showing oral bioavailability and brain penetration
by structure–activity relationship (SAR) study on the basis
of in vivo antagonistic activity on reserpine-induced hypothermia
in mice. By primary screening of the synthesized TRH mimetics, we
found a novel TRH mimetic: l-pyroglutamyl-[3-(thiazol-4-yl)-l-alanyl]-l-prolinamide with a high central nervous
system effect compared with TRH as a lead compound. Further SAR optimization
studies of this lead compound led to discovery of a novel orally effective
TRH mimetic: 1-{N-[(4S,5S)-(5-methyl-2-oxooxazolidine-4-yl)carbonyl]-3-(thiazol-4-yl)-l-alanyl}-(2R)-2-methylpyrrolidine trihydrate
(rovatirelin hydrate), which was selected as a candidate for clinical
trials.

==== Body
Introduction
Thyrotropin-releasing
hormone (TRH), first isolated from pig or
sheep, is a hypothalamic hormone that is synthesized in various areas
of the brain. TRH, composed of l-pyroglutamate, l-histidine and l-prolinamide (l-pGlu–l-His–l-Pro-NH2) (Figure 1),1,2 is
the smallest molecule among the known peptide hormones. TRH is distributed
in high concentrations in the brain and accelerates the synthesis
and secretion of thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH)3 and prolactin from the anterior pituitary. TRH also displays
physiological activities on the central nervous system (CNS), acting
as a neurotransmitter or a neuromodulator,4−6 and has been
used for the treatment of CNS disorders. Intact TRH (protirelin tartrate)7 has been clinically used for symptomatic therapy
of spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD) in Japan.

Figure 1 Chemical structure of
TRH (left), taltirelin hydrate (middle) and
lead compound 1 (right) and their lipophilicities.

It has been reported that two
subtypes of TRH receptor (TRH receptor
type 1: TRH-R18 and TRH receptor type 2:
TRH-R29,10) exist and TRH-R1 is related to endocrine
effects and TRH-R2 to CNS effects.11 On
the other hand, it has been reported that a single type of TRH receptor
is expressed in humans and that the human TRH receptor is similar
to TRH-R1.12,13 To separate the CNS and the endocrine
effects, a large number of TRH analogues such as taltirelin (TA-0910),14 orotirelin (CG-3509),15 montirelin (CG-3707),16 DN-1417,17 azetirelin (YM-14673),18 JTP-2942,19 posatirelin (RGH-2202),20 MK-771,21 and RX7736822 were synthesized and developed before 2000.
Because of the short half-life times in serum, low lipophilicity,
and oral absorption, most TRH mimetics have been developed as intravenous
injections and not for oral administration. Against such a background,
we have been carrying out structure–activity relationship (SAR)
studies with TRH to find orally effective TRH mimetics since the 1990s.
Among them, only taltirelin hydrate (CEREDIST), which is an agonist
at the human TRH-R has been launched in Japan as an orally effective
agent for treatment of SCD (Figure 1).14,23,24 After 2000, new types of TRH analogues such as NP-647, which binds
to TRH-R subtype selectively and has only CNS effects25 or prodrugs for brain targeting,26 were found and evaluated.

In a primary screening study, we
found a novel TRH mimetic: l-pyroglutamyl-[3-(thiazol-4-yl)-l-alanyl]-l-prolinamide 1(27) (Figure 1), which was used
as a lead compound. It has an unnatural amino acid 3-(thiazol-4-yl)-l-alanine moiety in the middle part of TRH instead of l-histidine. The most important feature of TRH mimetic 1 is its better lipophilicity than TRH, and 1 was found
to have high in vivo CNS effect (antagonistic effect on reserpine-induced
hypothermia) compared with TRH (see Table 1).

In this paper, we report a SAR study of lead compound 1 on the basis of its physicochemical properties, in vivo antagonistic
activity on reserpine-induced hypothermia in mice, TRH-R binding affinity,
and pharmacokinetic properties to find orally effective TRH mimetics
(Figure 2). We finally
selected a TRH mimetic 1-{N-[(4S,5S)-(5-methyl-2-oxooxazolidin-4-yl)carbonyl]-3-(thiazol-4-yl)-l-alanyl}-(2R)-2-methylpyrrolidine trihydrate
(rovatirelin hydrate) as a candidate for clinical development.

Results and Discussion
Chemistry
N-Terminus Fragments
All N-terminus fragments 3a–k were synthesized
from readily available N-Cbz protected l-serine 2a, l-threonine 2b, and
allo-l-threonine 2c (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of N-Terminus Fragments 3a–k
Reagents and conditions: (a)

DMF, rt, 91%; (d) MeI or BnBr, NaH, DMF, 0 °C, 86–88%;
(e) H2, Pd–C, MeOH, rt or aq. LiOH, THF-DME, rt,
80–98%; (f) SOCl2, MeOH, 0 °C to rt, quant;
(g) NaBH4, EtOH, 0 °C, 77%; and (h) Tf2O, pyridine, CH2Cl2, −35 °C, 45%.

N-Terminus amino acids, 2-oxooxazolidine-4-carboxylic
acid 3a, (4S,5R)- or
(4S,5S)-5-methyl-2-oxooxazolidine-4-carboxylic
acids 3b and 3c, were synthesized on the
basis of previous reports28−32 in one step by treatment of 2a–c with sodium
hydroxide, with oxazolidinone ring formation occurring rapidly. N-Methyl or N-benzyl (4S,5R)-5-methyl-2-oxooxazolidine-4-carboxylic acids 3g and 3h were both synthesized from carboxylic
acid 3b, via esterification with benzyl alcohol to afford
benzyl ester 3d. The benzyl ester 3d was
alkylated with iodomethane or benzyl bromide to afford N-methyl derivative 3e or N-benzyl derivative 3f, respectively. The benzyl ester 3e was deprotected
by catalytic hydrogenation to give N-methyl-4-carboxylic
acid 3g. On the other hand, the benzyl ester 3f was deprotected with aqueous lithium hydroxide to give N-benzyl-4-carboxylic acid 3h.

Trifluoromethanesulfonate 3k was synthesized from
carboxylic acid 3c via esterification with thionyl chloride
in methanol to afford methyl ester 3i, which was reduced
with sodium borohydride to give alcohol 3j. The alcohol
derivative 3j was sulfonylated with trifluoromethanesulfonic
anhydride to give trifluoromethanesulfonate 3k.

Middle-Part
Fragments
N-Boc-3-(thiazol-4-yl)-l-alanine 4a and N-Boc-3-(thiazol-5-yl)-l-alanine 4b were synthesized by alkylation of
diethyl acetamidomalonate (Schemes 2 and 3).

N-Boc-3-(thiazol-4-yl)-l-alanine 4a was synthesized on the basis of previous
reports.33−37 Here, we describe the synthesis of 4a from readily
available formamide 5 (Scheme 2). Formamide 5 was converted
to thioformamide 6 with Lawesson’s reagent. Thiazole
ring formation was accomplished by treatment of thioformamide 6 with 1,3-dichloroacetone to afford 4-chloromethylthiazole 7. The chloro derivative 7 was converted to the
desired (thiazol-4-yl)-l-alanine 4a via alkylation
of diethyl acetamidomalonate to give 8, with hydrolysis
to provide unprotected (thiazol-4-yl)-dl-alanine 9 and acetylation to give 10, which was not isolated.
The acetyl derivative 10 was optically resolved by enzymatic
deacetylation, with the amino group of the deacetylated l-enantiomer protected with Boc2O to give l-isomer 4a, with 99% ee.

Similarly, the synthesis of N-Boc-3-(thiazol-5-yl)-l-alanine 4b was accomplished from readily available
2-bromothiazole 11 (Scheme 3). The intermediates 2-trimethylsilylthiazole 12 and 5-formylthiazole 13 were synthesized on
the basis of Dondoni’s method.38 The formyl group of 13 was reduced with sodium borohydride
to afford hydroxymethylthiazole 14.39−41 The hydroxy
group of 14 was chlorinated with thionyl chloride to
afford 5-chloromethylthiazole 15. The chloro derivative 15 was converted to (thiazol-5-yl)-l-alanine 4b via diethyl ester 16 and ethyl ester 17 in a manner similar to Scheme 2.

C-Terminus Fragments
All C-terminus
fragments were
synthesized from readily available N-Cbz-l-proline 18, (4R)-4-thiazolidinecarboxylic

l-Prolinamide 22,42l-prolylmorpholine p-toluenesulfonate 24, and (4R)-4-thiazolidinecarboxamide 26(21) were synthesized in two steps
from 18 and 19 as starting materials, respectively
(Scheme 4).

Both
(2S)-2-cyanopyrrolidine p-toluenesulfonate 29 and (2R)-2-methylpyrrolidine
hydrochloride 33 were synthesized from 20 on the basis of previous reports43,44 (Scheme 5).

TRH Mimetics
All fragments were coupled from the C-terminus
to the N-terminus by a general peptide synthetic route to afford the
TRH mimetics shown in Schemes 6 and 7.45,46

Scheme 6 General
Synthetic Route of TRH Mimetics Including 4a and 4b as Middle-Part Fragments
Reagents
and conditions: (a)
DCC, HOBt or HOSu, DMF, 0 °C to rt; (b) HCl or TFA or p-TsOH·H2O, 0–50 °C; and (c)
DCC, HOSu, Et3N, DMF, 0 °C to rt.

Scheme 7 General Synthetic Route of TRH Mimetics Including l-Histidine
as the Middle-Part Fragment
Reagents and conditions:
(a)
(1) aq. HCl, NaNO2, H2O, 0 °C; (2) K2CO3, H2O, 0 °C to rt or (1) HCl
in 1,4-dioxane, isoamyl nitrite, DMF, −78 to 0 °C; (2)
Et3N, 0 °C to rt; (b) 25% HBr in acetic acid, rt or
H2, Pd–C, MeOH, rt; and (c) DCC, HOSu, Et3N, DMF, 0 °C to rt.

When 4a and 4b were used as the middle
part, the synthetic route was as shown in Scheme 6. The C-terminus fragments 22, 24, 26, 29, and 33 were coupled with the middle-part fragments 4a and 4b using DCC and HOBt or HOSu to obtain N-Boc dipeptide mimetics 34, 35, 37–41, 43, and 44, respectively. The Boc groups
of intermediates 34, 35, 37–41, 43, and 44 were deprotected under acidic
conditions (HCl in solvents, TFA, or p-toluenesulfonic
acid monohydrate) to afford dipeptide mimetics 45, 46, 48–52, 54, and 55, respectively. Intermediates 45, 46, 48–52, 54, and 55 were coupled with N-terminus fragments l-pyroglutamic acid, 3a–c, to afford TRH mimetics 1, 56–65, 67–71, and 73–77, respectively.

When using commercially available Nα-Cbz-l-histidine hydrazide47 as
the middle-part fragment, the synthetic route was as shown in Scheme 7. The C-terminus
fragments 22 and 33 were coupled with Nα-Cbz-l-histidine hydrazide by
the azide method to afford N-Cbz dipeptide mimetics 36 and 42, respectively. The Cbz group of intermediate 36 was deprotected with 25% hydrogen bromide in acetic acid
to afford dipeptide 47. On the other hand, the Cbz group
of intermediate 42 was deprotected by catalytic hydrogenation
to afford dipeptide mimetic 53. Finally, dipeptide mimetics 47 and 53 were coupled with 3c using
DCC and HOSu to obtain TRH mimetics 66 and 72, respectively.

The chemical structure of the TRH mimetics 1, 56–74 are shown in Table 1. The yields of the N-Boc
or N-Cbz dipeptide mimetics 34–44, dipeptide mimetics 45–55, and TRH mimetics 1, 56–74 are shown in the Supporting Information.

The synthetic method
to obtain TRH mimetics with carboxyl group 75 or secondary
amide group 76 and 77 at the C-terminus
is shown in Scheme 8.

Scheme 8 Synthesis of TRH Mimetics 75–77
Reagents and conditions: (a)
LiOH·H2O, MeOH–H2O, rt, 80%; (b)
amylamine or tert-butylamine, HOBt, DCC, DMF, 0 °C
to rt, 62–65%.

The synthetic method
to obtain TRH mimetic with N-terminus 2-oxooxazolidine-4-yl-methyl
moiety 78 is shown in Scheme 9.

Scheme 9 Synthesis of TRH Mimetic 78
Reagents and conditions: (a) 45, Et3N, DMF, 0 °C to rt, 27%.

The synthesized TRH mimetics 1 and 56–78 were purified by gel-filtration column chromatography
packed with
styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer resin (MCI GEL CHP-20P) using aqueous
methanol as an eluent and/or silica gel column chromatography using
chloroform–methanol(−water) as an eluent.

In the
process of conversion from 45–47 and 49 having the l-prolinamide moiety or (4R)-4-thiazolidinecarboxamide moiety to TRH mimetics 1, 56–66, and 68, diketopiperazines
were produced as byproducts7,21 (Scheme 10). The diketopiperazines were
produced immediately after addition of triethylamine in the coupling
reaction. On the other hand, in the case of 69–72 having the cyano or the methyl group, no diketopiperazines were
produced.

Scheme 10 Diketopiperazines Produced from Dipeptide Mimetics 45–47 and 49
Physicochemical Properties of TRH Mimetics
The physicochemical
properties were estimated by clog P and Slog P. clog P, which is the log of the octanol/water
partition coefficient, was calculated using ChemBioDraw Ultra. Slog P, which is the log of the octanol/water partition coefficient
(including implicit hydrogens), was calculated using Molecular Operating
Environment (MOE). This property is an atomic contribution model48 obtained by calculating log P from the given structure; that is, the correct protonation state
(washed structures). Results may vary with the log P (o/w) descriptor. The training set for Slog P was
∼7000 structures. All results are shown in Table 1.

In Vivo CNS Effect of TRH
Mimetics
We selected the
reserpine-induced hypothermia model as the classical assay method
for SAR including CNS effects in the first tier assay for compound
selection. The CNS effects of TRH mimetics (1, 56–78) were evaluated by their antagonistic effect
on reserpine-induced hypothermia in mice.14f,14g The mice used had rectal temperatures of 30 °C or lower about
18 h after subcutaneous administration of reserpine (3 mg/kg). Rectal
temperature was measured by thermistor before and up to 7 h after,
oral administration of TRH and TRH mimetics at a dose of 50 and 5
μmol/kg, respectively. The CNS effect of the test drugs on reserpine-induced
hypothermia was evaluated on the basis of the area under the temperature–time
curve after dosing (AUC0–7h) (see the Experimental Section). All results are shown
as the oral effective dose in Table 1. All animal studies were conducted under the approval
of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Shionogi Research
Laboratories. The results of the SAR study of the TRH mimetics are
shown in Table 1.

We first conducted optimization from the N-terminus, examining TRH
mimetics 1, 58–61, 64, and 78. The l-pyroglutamate of 1 was converted to one having the 2-oxooxazolidine carbonyl moiety 58. The biological activity was maintained by introducing
an oxygen atom (data not shown). Introducing a methyl group on the
5-position of oxazolidinone ring, the lipophilicity was increased
(clog P = −0.528, Slog P =
−0.856). The CNS effects vary depending on stereochemistry.
The cis configuration 64 had a higher effect than the
trans configuration 59. Introducing a methyl group 60 or a benzyl group 61 on the 3-position of
the oxazolidinone ring decreased the CNS effects (data not shown).
Therefore, the NH of the 3-position of the oxazolidinone
ring was essential for the high activity. Converting the carbonyl
group 64 to methylene 78 increased the lipophilicity
(clog P = −1.097, Slog P =
−0.383), but the CNS effect decreased slightly. As a result,
(4S,5S)-5-methyl-2-oxooxazolidine-4-carbonyl
moiety 64 was considered to be the best for the N-terminus.

Next, we optimized the middle part of the mimetics. For the middle
part, when the 3-(thiazol-4-yl)-l-alanine moiety 64 was introduced in place of l-histidine
moiety 66, 64 had a higher CNS effect than 66. Increasing the lipophilicity seemed to lead to higher
oral absorption and brain penetration. The substitution position on
the thiazole ring was significantly important. The lipophilicity of
the 3-(thiazol-4-yl)-l-alanine moiety 64 and
the 3-(thiazol-5-yl)-l-alanine moiety 65 were
equal (clog P = −0.528, Slog P = −0.856); however, the biological activity of 65 was much lower than that of 64. This indicated that
the positioning of the nitrogen and sulfur atoms in the thiazole ring
was critical for the activity.49−51 As a result, the 3-(thiazol-4-yl)-l-alanine moiety 64 seemed to be the best for the
middle part.

Finally, we optimized the C-terminus of the mimetics
by replacing
the l-prolinamide moiety with other moieties to increase
the lipophilicity to improve the CNS effect, with TRH mimetics 67–70 and 73–77. As for the C-terminus
part of TRH mimetics 67–70, 73–77 were examined. It is known that the l-prolinamide moiety
is important for the formation of the hydrogen bond with Arg283 of
TRH receptor52,53 to have expression of the biological
activities. In the case of the TRH mimetic having the (4R)-4-thiazolidinecarboxamide moiety 68, both lipophilicity
(clog P = 0.131, Slog P = −0.946)
and CNS effect increased. When the l-prolinamide moiety was
converted to l-proline secondary amide moiety 76 and 77 or tertiary amide moiety 67, the
lipophilicities increased; however, the CNS effects decreased remarkably.
On the other hand, when l-prolinamide moiety 64 was converted to the (2S)-cyanopyrrolidine moiety 69, lipophilicity (clog P = −0.0044,
Slog P = 0.182) increased but the CNS effect decreased
slightly. However, replacement of the l-prolinamide moiety
of 64 with the (2R)-methylpyrrolidine
moiety 70 led to much higher lipophilicity (clog P = 0.639, Slog P = 0.678) and CNS effect
than 64. When l-prolinamide moiety 64 was converted to l-prolinol moiety 73 and l-proline moiety 75, the lipophilicities (73: clog P = −0.143, Slog P = −0.349, 75: clog P = 0.331, Slog P = −0.257) increased but
the CNS effects decreased markedly. TRH mimetics 56, 57, 62, 63, 71, 72, and 74 were synthesized and evaluated; however,
the CNS effects of these compounds were less than that of 64. As a result, l-prolinamide moiety 64, (4R)-4-thiazolidinecarboxamide moiety 68, (2S)-cyanopyrrolidine moiety 69, and (2R)-methylpyrrolidine moiety 70 were considered
to be suitable for the C-terminus part.

TRH Receptor Binding in
Rat
TRH receptor binding of
TRH and TRH mimetics were evaluated using a rat brain preparation.
As the TRH receptor included both TRH-R1 and TRH-R2 in the rat brain
preparation, it was not possible to establish whether TRH mimetics
were binding preferentially to TRH-R1 or TRH-R2. The results of the
TRH receptor binding assay are shown in Table 1.

TRH mimetics 1, 58, 59, 64–66, and 68, which have l-prolinamide moiety or (4R)-4-thiazolidinecarboxamide moiety at the C-terminus indicated
much higher affinity than that of TRH mimetics, which have (2S)-cyanopyrrolidine moiety 69, (2R)-methylpyrrolidine moiety 70, (2S)-hydroxymethylpyrrolidine
moiety 73, and l-proline moiety 75. When the C-terminus (2R)-methylpyrrolidine moiety 70 was oxidized to (2S)-hydroxymethylpyrrolidine
moiety 73 and l-proline moiety 75, the affinities to TRH receptor decreased. As for the middle part,
the TRH mimetic, which has 3-(thiazol-4-yl)-l-alanine moiety 64, had a higher affinity than l-histidine moiety 66. The TRH mimetic with 3-(thiazol-5-yl)-l-alanine
moiety 65 did not show any affinity at all. Therefore,
the positioning of the nitrogen and sulfur atoms in the thiazole ring
was critical not only for the CNS effect but also for binding to TRH
receptor. On the other hand, l-histidine moiety 66 showed the same affinity as TRH. As for the N-terminus part, 2-oxooxazolidine
carbonyl moiety 58 had almost equal affinity to l-pyroglutamate moiety 1. The cis configuration 64 between the methyl group and the carbonyl group had much
higher affinity than the trans configuration 59. It is
considered that the CNS effects among TRH mimetics are not equal to
the binding affinity to TRH receptor.

As a result of their CNS
effect in mice, physicochemical properties,
and TRH receptor binding affinity, four TRH mimetics 64, 68–70 were selected for further investigation
of PK parameters in rats.

times (MRT) of the four TRH mimetics 64, 68–70 in rat after intravenous (i.v.)
administration at a dose of 1 μmol/kg were evaluated. Also,
the bioavailability (BA) of these four TRH mimetics in rat after per
oral administration was evaluated. Moreover, free fraction ratio (fu)
in serum was evaluated in vitro examinations. These PK properties
are shown in Table 2. The CL of four TRH mimetics was lower than that of TRH. However,
the t1/2 and MRT of four TRH mimetics
which have l-prolinamide moiety 64, (4R)-4-thiazolidinecarboxamide moiety 68, (2S)-cyanopyrrolidine moiety 69, and (2R)-methylpyrrolidine moiety 70 at the C-terminus
were much longer than that of TRH; TRH mimetics 64 and 68 were shorter than those for the TRH mimetics 69 or 70. Although the Vdss of TRH mimetics 64, 68, and 69 were lower than that
of TRH, TRH mimetic 70 showed the highest value. Therefore,
the (2R)-methylpyrrolidine moiety is significant
to increase the tissue distribution. The BA of TRH mimetics 64 and 70 were 1.1 and 4.7%, respectively. Oral
BA for TRH mimetics 68 and 69 could not
be calculated due to low absorption. As a consequence, TRH mimetic 70 had the best total PK properties among the four TRH mimetics
and a favorable effect would be predicted in rats.

From the data of the CNS effect,
PK properties, TRH receptor affinity,
and the synthetic viewpoint that the diketopiperazine was not produced
in the process of the coupling reaction, we selected TRH mimetic 70 as a candidate for further development. Moreover, in the
process of scale-up synthesis of 70, the trihydrate of 70 was obtained as a stable crystalline solid. We selected
this trihydrate 79 (rovatirelin hydrate)27,55,56 as the preferred candidate (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Chemical structure of 79 (rovatirelin hydrate).

X-ray Crystallography of 79
Single crystals
of 79 were recrystallized by gradual cooling of a saturated
aqueous solution and obtained as the trihydrate. 79 has
four asymmetric carbons; their absolute stereochemistry was determined
by X-ray structural analysis. The X-ray crystal structure is shown
in Figure 4. Three
water molecules of 79 were omitted to compare the X-ray
crystal structure of TRH,57 in which tartrate
molecule and water molecules were omitted. 79 has three
heterocyclic rings (oxazolidinone ring, thiazole ring, and pyrrolidine
ring) and these groups are oriented to form a “propeller-shaped”
conformation. This conformation is similar to the proposed TRH bioactive
conformation.58,59 Moreover, the “propeller-shaped”
conformation seemed to be extremely important for high receptor binding.
Three water molecules of 79 were coordinated to the amide
bond, thiazole ring, and oxazolidinone ring. Each of them was used
to form intramolecular hydrogen bonding (see the Supporting Information).

Figure 4 X-ray crystal structures of 79 (CCDC-1442496) (left)
and TRH (CCDC-1275682) (right).57 Crystallographic
data are summarized in Tables S4–S9.

In vitro binding activities of
TRH and 79 for human
TRH-R have been reported previously.56 The Ki values of TRH and 79 for human
TRH-R are 128 and 702 nM, respectively. As the human TRH-R is more
similar to TRH-R1 than TRH-R2,12,13 the effect of TRH analogues
may be related to TRH-R1 in human. The homology of the TRH-R1 receptor
is also well conserved in many species. The human TRH-R is 90.3 and
89.2% homologous to that of mouse and rat at the DNA level, respectively.11 Thus, the pharmacological effects of 79 in mouse and rat may be explained by the human TRH-R binding activity.

In Vivo CNS Effects of 79
The CNS effects
of TRH and 79 were tested by examining their in vivo
antagonistic activity on reserpine-induced hypothermia in mice.14 A representative figure for the rectal temperature–time
curve is shown in Figure 5. After oral administration of 79 at a dose of
5 μmol/kg, the rectal temperature was maintained sustainably
over a 2.5 °C temperature range from 2 to 7 h and compared with
saline levels. TRH, at a dose of 50 μmol/kg, led to almost the
same low rectal temperature profiles as the saline levels from 0 to
7 h after oral administration. The area under the rectal temperature–time
curve up to 7 h (AUC) of 79 was higher than that of saline
and TRH (Table 3).
The saline-stripped AUC (ΔAUC) of 79 was higher
than that of TRH in spite of a 10-fold dose difference (5 vs 50 μmol/kg).

Improvement Effect of 79 on Cerebellar Ataxia in
Rats
We investigated improvement effects of 79 on ataxia in animals with cerebellar ataxia induced by administration
of cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) in the neonatal period. Neonate Sprague-Dawley
rats were subcutaneously injected 60 mg/kg at age of 2 and 3 days
(the day of confirming delivery: age of 0 day). Ara-C administered
rats were subjected to the experiment at age of 4 weeks. 79 and TRH were orally administered once daily for 7 days to assess
ataxia at 24 h after final administration. Severity of ataxia was
assessed by the open field test which measured the number of ambulation
events and falls. In brief, each animal was placed on the center of
the circular open field (75 cm in diameter, 25 parts). The number
of crossing parts (number of ambulation) and the number of falls for
3 min were measured to calculate the fall index ([number of falls]/[number
of ambulation]). On the basis of the fall index, the severity of ataxia
was assessed. The fall index in the control group was 2.27 (mean).
In the 79 0.1 mg/kg group, no significant decrease was
observed in the fall index. In the 79 0.3 mg/kg group,
a significant decrease to 1.36 was observed in the fall index. The
decrease in the fall index was dose-dependent up to 3 mg/kg. Although
significant decrease was observed in the fall index in the 79 10 and 30 mg/kg groups compared with that in the control group,
the fall index increased more than the 3 mg/kg group. On the other
hand, after administration of TRH, no significant decrease was observed
in the fall index at any doses (30, 100, and 300 mg/kg). When TRH
was intravenously administered once to assess ataxia at 30 min post-dose,
a significant decrease was observed in the fall index at the doses
of 10 and 30 mg/kg [fall index: mean ± SE (n = 10–17), vehicle: 2.06 ± 0.09, 10 mg/kg: 1.05 ±
0.22, and 30 mg/kg: 0.87 ± 0.17] (Figure 6).

TSH Releasing Activity
of 79
We examined
the TSH releasing activity of 79 after oral administration
in rats. After oral administration of 79 at a dose of
0.1 and 1 mg/kg, the plasma TSH levels at 0.5 h elevated up to 46.8
and 80.4 ng/mL, respectively. Then, plasma TSH level recovered to
vehicle levels at 24 h (Figure 7).

PK Properties of 79
Plasma concentration–time
profiles of TRH and 79 after oral administration to fasted
conscious rats at a dose of 40 mg/kg are presented in Figure 8. The PK parameters are summarized
in Table 4. After oral
administration, the profiles of plasma concentration of 79 were higher than those of TRH up to the experiment period (8 h)
and, Cmax and AUC0–8h values of 79 were over 12 times higher than that of
TRH. It seems that the stronger and more sustained efficacies of 79 for reserpine-induced hypothermia in mice and cerebellar
ataxia in rats could also be attributed to the longer sustained plasma
exposure and high brain Kp to 79 compared with TRH.

Stability Study of 79
Stability of 79 in rat plasma and
brain homogenate was evaluated. The amount
of 79 remaining after incubation at 37 °C is shown
in Table 5. Almost
no degradation of 79 was seen in rat plasma, cerebrum,
and cerebellum homogenate samples even after 180 min. It was reported
that taltirelin and TRH were degraded by the brain homogenate with t1/2 of 64.4 and 7.9 min, respectively,60 suggesting that 79 is more stable
in the brain than taltirelin and TRH.

CYP Inhibition
and Safety Information of 79
79 did not directly inhibit the 10 CYP enzymes (CYP1A2,
CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/5,
and CYP4A11) examined by more than 50% at the highest concentration
tested (300 μM). 79 caused no more than 10% inhibition
of CYP activity except for CYP2C8, which displayed approximately 20%
inhibition. The acute lethal dose of 79 in rats was over
2000 mg/kg in a single oral administration.

Summary
and Conclusions
We conducted SAR studies of TRH to find orally
effective TRH mimetics.
The oxygen atom was introduced to the five-membered ring in the N-terminus
part 58, leading to better lipophilicity than l-pyroglutamate. Introduction of a methyl group to the 5-position
of oxazolidinone ring 64 led to increased CNS effect
and affinity to TRH receptor. The relative configuration between the
methyl group and the carbonyl group was significant. Cis configuration 64 showed higher CNS effect and affinity to TRH receptor than
trans configuration 59. Moreover, the carbonyl group
of 64 was important because when a methylene was introduced
instead of carbonyl group 78, the CNS effect decreased.
It seemed that the carbonyl group was used to form a hydrogen bond
with the target receptor or maintain the active conformation of the
molecule. A thiazole ring in the middle-part, as in 1 and 64, was more suitable than the imidazole ring,
but the substitution position of the thiazole ring was significantly
important. The 4-position substituent 64 showed high
CNS effect, but the 5-position substituent 65 had no
activity. The position of the nitrogen atom of the thiazole ring seemed
to be important for forming a hydrogen bond with the target receptor
and also for higher biological activity. It was speculated that converting
the imidazole to thiazole lead to increasing the lipophilicity of
molecule, with accompanying improvements in passing the blood–brain
barrier. TRH mimetics that had the (4R)-4-thiazolidinecarboxamide
moiety 68, (2S)-cyanopyrrolidine moiety 69, or the (2R)-methylpyrrolidine moiety 70 as the C-terminus part instead of the l-prolinamide
moiety 64 maintained high biological activities. The l-prolinamide moiety was not essential for a high CNS effect.
As a result of the SAR study, and taking into consideration the CNS
effect, PK properties, and physicochemical characteristics, along
with synthetic tractability, we selected 70 as a candidate,
despite 70 having a weaker binding affinity for the TRH
receptor than TRH and some of the TRH mimetics. Subsequently, TRH
mimetic 70 was developed in clinical trials as the trihydrate 79 named rovatirelin hydrate.55,56 Although rovatirelin
hydrate showed approximately six times less in vitro binding activity
for human TRH receptor than TRH,56 in vivo
efficacy of rovatirelin hydrate for reserpine-induced hypothermia
in mice and on cerebellar ataxia in rats was stronger than that of
TRH. The strong CNS effect of rovatirelin hydrate may be due to increased
oral BA, higher distribution to the target brain region, and greater
stability in plasma, cerebrum, and cerebellum than TRH. Rovatirelin
hydrate was designed for higher lipophilicity than TRH for better
intestinal and brain permeability. Therefore, rovatirelin hydrate,
which was first found by our group,55 is
currently in a phase III clinical trial (NCT02889302) in SCD patients.

Experimental
Section
General
All solvents and reagents were obtained from
commercial sources and were used as received. Melting points (mp)
were measured with a Yanagimoto melting point apparatus and were uncorrected.
Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 20SXB FT-IR spectrometer. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were taken with a Varian
VXR-200 or Gemini-200300 FT-NMR spectrometer using tetramethylsilane
as an internal standard. Optical rotations were determined with a
PerkinElmer 430 polarimeter. Elemental analyses were performed by
Shionogi Research Laboratories (Shionogi & Co., Ltd. 3-1-1, Futaba-cho,
Toyonaka-shi, Osaka 561-0825, Japan). For silica gel column chromatography,
Kiesel gel 60 (0.063–0.20 mm, Merck) was employed for the purification.
For gel-filtration chromatography, MCI GEL CHP-20P (75–150
g, Mitsubishi Chemical Industries) was utilized with aqueous MeOH
as an eluent. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out with
Merck silica gel 603–254 plates mainly using the following
three solvent systems: (a) CHCl3/MeOH (9/1), (b) CHCl3/MeOH/H2O (32/6/0.5), and (c) CHCl3/MeOH/H2O (6/4/1). The spots were detected under ultraviolet irradiation
at 254 nm and by the use of phosphomolybdic acid in ethanol solution
and ninhydrin sprays.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of TRH

l-Pyroglutamyl-[3-(thiazol-4-yl)-l-alanyl]-l-prolinamide (1)
To an ice-cooled solution
of l-pyroglutamic acid (1.76 g, 13.6 mmol) and HOSu (1.73
g, 15.0 mmol) in DMF (50.0 mL), DCC (3.09 g, 15.0 mmol) was added,
and the mixture was stirred for 2 h at the same temperature. [3-(Thiazol-4-yl)-l-alanyl]-l-prolinamide dihydrochloride (45) (6.67 g, 15.0 mmol) and triethylamine (4.60 mL, 33.0 mmol) were
added to the solution, and the mixture was stirred for 1 h. The ice
bath was removed and the mixture was stirred overnight. The precipitate
was filtered off and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure.
A small amount of water was added to the residue, and the precipitate
was filtered off. The filtrate was purified by gel-filtration chromatography
(MCI GEL CHP-20P, 200 mL, eluent: H2O/MeOH). The purified
fractions were concentrated in vacuo and the residue was lyophilized
to afford the title compound 1 (2.54 g, 49%) as a white
amorphous powder.

Experiments Using Laboratory Animals
All experiments
using laboratory animals were conducted in accordance with the guideline
by the Animal Care and Use Committee in Shionogi.

Anti Reserpine-Induced
Hypothermia Effect in Mice
Male
ddY mice were purchased from SLC Japan Inc. at the age of 6 weeks.
After quarantine for 1 week, the mice were placed in animal compartments
with a controlled room temperature of approximately 25 °C and
relative humidity of approximately 60%, and a light cycle time of
12 h [light (8:00–20:00)/dark (20:00–8:00)]. Reserpine-induced
hypothermia was conducted by the following method.14 The mice used had rectal temperatures of 30 °C or
lower about 18 h after subcutaneous administration of reserpine (3
mg/kg, 1 mg/mL reserpine injection; Daiichi, Tokyo, Japan). TRH and
TRH mimetics were dissolved in saline. Rectal temperature was measured
with a thermistor (MGA-III, Nihon Kohden) before and after oral administration
of TRH and TRH mimetics up to 7 h after a dose of 50 and 5 μmol/kg/mL,
respectively. The antagonistic effect of the test drugs on reserpine-induced
hypothermia was evaluated on the basis of the area under the temperature–time
curve after dosing (AUC0–7h). All of the mice used
in the experiments were killed immediately after the last measurement.

TRH Receptor Binding
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (300–400
g body weight) were sacrificed and dissected on ice to obtain the
whole brain excluding the olfactory bulb. The brain was homogenized
with glass/Teflon homogenizer (20 strokes) in 20-fold volume of 20
mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 40 000g for 30 min. The pellet was washed and re-centrifuged under
the same conditions. The obtained pellet was suspended in 50-fold
volume of 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The TRH receptor binding
was conducted with [3H]-(3-Me-His2)-TRH (Daiichi
Chemical, specific activity 82.5 Ci/mmol) and the crude membrane preparation
(ca. 0.4 mg protein). The tracer, test compounds, and the membrane
preparation were incubated in 0.2 mL of phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH
7.4) in ice cold water for 2 h. After the incubation, the sample was
filtered through a Whatman GF/C filter, and the filter was washed
three times with the buffer, and then the retained radioactivity was
counted with a liquid scintillation counter. The nonspecific binding
was measured in the presence of 10 μM TRH (BACHEM). The saturation
and inhibition binding studies were conducted with 0.125–8
and 2 nM of [3H]-(3-Me-His2)-TRH. The Ki value was calculated with the following formula: Ki = IC50/1 + (ligand/Kd).

PK Experiments of TRH Mimetics 64, 68–70 in Rat
Male Sprague-Dawley rats
were purchased from Charles
River Laboratories Japan, Inc. at the age of 7 weeks. After quarantine
for 1 week in the Animal Care Laboratory (Shionogi & Co., Ltd.),
the rats were placed in animal compartments with a controlled room
temperature of approximately 25 °C and relative humidity of approximately
60%, and a light cycle time of 12 h [light (8:00–20:00)/dark
(20:00–8:00)]. All animal studies were conducted with the approval
of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Shionogi Research
Laboratories (n = 2, 302–364 g body weight).
For oral administration, 2 μmol portions of TRH and TRH mimetics
mixture as cassette dosing61,62 were accurately weighed
and dissolved in the dimethyl sulfoxide/0.5% methyl cellulose aq.
sol. = 1/4 to obtain the dosing solution with the target concentration
and dose of 2 μmol/5 mL/kg. For intravenous administration,
1 μmol portions of TRH and TRH mimetics mixture as cassette
dosing were accurately weighed and dissolved in the dimethyl sulfoxide/propylene
glycol = 1/1 to obtain the dosing solution with the target concentration
and dose of 1 μmol/1 mL/kg. Blood (approximately 0.3 mL) was
collected from the jugular vein directory using a heparinized syringe
at the scheduled time after administration. The samples were immediately
centrifuged in approximately 10 000g for 5
min at 4 °C to obtain plasma, which was transferred into a tube
and stored in a freezer at approximately −20 °C until
the determination of the concentrations of TRH and TRH mimetics. Methanol/acetonitrile
= 1/1 mixture was added to the plasma with mixing in a tube with a
mixer and centrifugation in approximately 10 000g for 5 min at 4 °C to obtain the supernatant. The supernatant
was injected into LC/MS/MS systems (ESI positive mode), which was
a Qtrap 5500 system (AB SCIEX Pte. Ltd.) to determine the plasma concentration
of TRH and TRH mimetics.

Ara-C-Induced Cerebellar Ataxia in Rat
Male and female
neonates from Sprague-Dawley pregnant rats (purchased from Clea Japan
at 13–17 days of pregnancy) were used. Cytosine arabinoside
(Ara-C) was prepared using physiological saline before use and was
subcutaneously injected at 60 mg/kg into the dorsal region at age
of 2 days and age of 3 days (the day of confirming delivery: age of
0 day). Ara-C-administered animals were housed in room temperature:
22–27 °C, relative humidity: 25–74%, lighting period:
12 h from 7:00. Animals were allowed free access to diets (Clea Japan,
CA-1) and water (tap water) by the experiment at age of 3–5
weeks. On the measurement of ataxia, each animal was placed on the
center of the circular open field (75 cm in diameter, 25 parts). The
number of crossing parts (number of ambulation) and the number of
falls for 3 min were measured to calculate fall index ([number of
falls]/[number of ambulation]). On the basis of the fall index, the
severity of ataxia was assessed. To equalize the severity of ataxia
among animals, the fall index ([number of falls]/[number of ambulation])
was measured at baseline (in the morning on the day of experiment
for the day before initiation of the experiment for the 7 day repeated-dose
experiment) for each animal except animals that did not fall down.
Animals with the baseline fall index ranging 1.71–2.19 were
included in the study. The severity of ataxia was assessed at 24 h
after final administration in the 7 days of repeated oral dose. Animals
in the control group were administered physiological saline.

TSH Releasing
Activity in Rat
Animal rearing conditions:
male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Nippon Clea Co. Ltd at
the age of 7 weeks. After quarantine for 1 week in the Animal Care
Laboratory (Shionogi & Co., Ltd.), the rats were placed in animal
compartments with a controlled room temperature of approximately 25
°C and relative humidity of approximately 60%, and a light cycle
time of 12 h [light (7:00–19:00)/dark (19:00–7:00)].
At least n = 4, 258–320 g body weight. For
oral administration, 2 mg portions of TRH mimetics were accurately
weighed and dissolved in the water to obtain the dosing solution with
the target concentration and dose of 0.1 and 1 mg/2 mL/kg. Blood (approximately
3 mL) was collected by decapitation at the scheduled time after oral
administration to fed rats. The blood samples were placed for 30 min
at room temperature (25 °C) and centrifuged in approximately
10 000g for 5 min at 4 °C using a centrifuge
to obtain serum, which was transferred into a tube and stored in a
freezer at approximately −20 °C until determination of
the concentrations of TSH levels. Serum TSH levels were determined
by the assay kit which was BIOTRAKTM Rat thyroid stimulating hormone
[125I] assay system with magnetic separation, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech,
code: RPA554.

PK Experiments of 79 in Rat
Male Wistar
rats were purchased from SLC Japan Inc. at the age of 10 or 11 weeks.
After quarantine for 1 week in the Animal Care Laboratory (Shionogi
& Co., Ltd.), the rats were placed in animal compartments with
a controlled room temperature of approximately 25 °C and relative
humidity of approximately 60%, and a light cycle time of 12 h [light
(8:00–20:00)/dark (20:00–8:00)]. In the fasting study,
the rats were reared under fasting condition from the evening of the
day before administration until the 12 h-sampling after administration.
Each rat was subjected to surgery to insert a cannula tube into the
jugular vein under isoflurane anesthesia at 2 or 3 days before administration.
At least n = 4, 230–274 g body weight. For
oral administration, 40 mg portions of TRH and TRH mimetics were accurately
weighed and dissolved in the saline to obtain the dosing solution
with the target concentration and dose of 40 mg/4 mL/kg. For intravenous
administration, 8 mg portions of TRH and TRH mimetics were accurately
weighed and dissolved in the saline to obtain the dosing solution
with the target concentration and dose of 8 mg/1.6 mL/kg. Blood (approximately
0.3 mL) was collected from the cannula inserted into the jugular vein
using a heparinized syringe at the scheduled time after administration.
The samples were immediately centrifuged in approximately 10 000g for 5 min at 4 °C using a centrifuge to obtain plasma,
which was transferred into a tube and stored in a freezer at approximately
−20 °C until determination of the concentrations of TRH
and TRH mimetics. Methanol was added to the plasma with mixing in
a tube with a mixer and centrifugation at approximately 10 000g for 5 min at 4 °C to obtain the supernatant. The
supernatant was injected into HPLC systems, which was Waters 805 system
(Waters 717 auto sampler, Waters 486 Tunable Absorbance detector,
Waters 600 Controller) to determine the plasma concentration of TRH
and TRH mimetics.

Brain Kp Experiments of 79 in
Rat
Male
Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Nippon Clea Co. Ltd at the
age of 7 weeks. After quarantine for 1 week in the Animal Care Laboratory
(Shionogi & Co., Ltd.), the rats were placed in animal compartments
with a controlled room temperature of approximately 23 °C and
relative humidity of approximately 55%, and a light cycle time of
12 h [light (8:00–20:00)/dark (20:00–8:00)]. In the
fasting study, the rats were reared under fasting condition from the
evening of the day before administration until the 12 h-sampling after
administration. n = 4, 262–312 g body weight.
Each rat was subjected to surgery to insert a cannula tube into the
jugular vein and micro dialysis cannula tube into ventral tegmental
area of brain under pentobarbital anesthesia at 3 days before administration.
For oral administration, 40 mg portions of 79 was accurately
weighed and dissolved in the saline to obtain the dosing solution
with the target concentration and dose of 40 mg/2 mL/kg. Blood (approximately
0.3 mL) was collected from the cannula inserted into the jugular vein
using a heparinized syringe at the scheduled time after administration.
The samples were immediately centrifuged in approximately 3000g for 5 min at 4 °C using a centrifuge to obtain plasma,
which was transferred into a tube and stored in a freezer at approximately
−20 °C until determination of the concentrations of 79. Methanol was added to the plasma with mixing in a tube
with a mixer and centrifugation at 10 000g for 5 min at 4 °C to obtain the supernatant. Micro dialysis
solution was collected from the cannula inserted into the ventral
tegmental area of brain using a micro syringe pump (1 μL/min
of Ringer solution) at the scheduled time after administration.

The supernatant and dialysis solution were injected into HPLC systems
with a mass spectrometer, which was Waters 606 system (Waters 717
auto sampler, Thermo Quest TSQ7000 mass spectrometer) to determine
the plasma and brain dialysis concentration of 79.

Stability Study in Rat Plasma and Brain Homogenate
Animal
rearing conditions: male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased
from Nippon Clea Co. Ltd at the age of 7 weeks. After quarantine for
1 week in the Animal Care Laboratory (Shionogi & Co., Ltd.), the
rats were placed in animal compartments with a controlled room temperature
of approximately 25 °C and relative humidity of approximately
60%, and a light cycle time of 12 h [light (8:00–20:00)/dark
(20:00–8:00)]. 79 in vitro stability test in plasma
and brain homogenate (n = 5, 292–306 g body
weight).

Test concentration: approximately 1 μg/mL. Nonfasted
rats were anesthetized under ether and exsanguinated from the abdominal
aorta. The blood was centrifuged (3000g, 5 min) and
the plasma collected. Brains were then promptly extracted, divided
into cerebrum and cerebellum, nine volumes of phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) solution (Dulbecco’s PBS (-): Nissui Co.) added, and
10% homogenates prepared in a Polytron homogenizer. Five milliliter
quantities of the plasma, cerebrum, and cerebellum homogenates (5
samples of each) were placed in 50 mL capacity tubes, cooled in ice,
and mixed with 50 μL of each drug sample solution adjusted to
approximately 0.1 mg/kg. Sampling (0 min) was then promptly carried
out. Each test solution was left on a water bath at 37 °C, and
sampling of 0.1 mL quantities was carried out after 5, 15, 30, 60,
120, and 180 min. Three volumes of methanol was added and mixed with
each sample of test solution, the mixture was centrifuged, and the
supernatant was collected and stored at -20 °C until determined
by TLC. The supernatants were spotted onto TLC plates (20 × 20
cm silica gel 60 F254, Merck Co.) and promptly developed with the
following mixed solvents: CHCl3/MeOH/H2O = 32/6/0.5.
After TLC development, [14C]-79 was kept in
contact with X-ray film for 2–3 weeks, and the positions of
the labeled entities was confirmed after development. Unchanged drug
and other metabolites were separately scraped off the plates and put
into glass vials. Distilled water (1 mL) and 15 mL of Pico-Fluor 40
were added and left overnight, and then the radioactivity in each
sample was measured by liquid scintillation counter.
