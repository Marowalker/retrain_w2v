To determine anti-inflammatory
effects of traditional Okinawan
vegetable methanol extracts, we examined the inflammatory mediators
from mouse macrophage by the addition of extracts prepared from two
kinds of nishi-yomogi and hosoba-wadan. Moreover, we inspected the
impact of extracts using a carrageenin-induced acute inflammatory
animal model. In the case of in vitro study, nitric oxide and cytokine
concentrations of supernatant were analyzed with Griess reagent and
a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit, respectively.
Gene expressions related to the inflammation were extrapolated from
the data of real-time polymerase chain reaction. In the case of in
vivo study, six-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats were intraperitoneally
administered with vegetable extracts, and then developed edema by
carrageenin administration on the footpad. The footpad volume was
obtained from the difference in volume before and after carrageenin
administration. In the case of in vitro study, nitric oxide and tumor
necrosis factor-α concentrations of the Kume nishi-yomogi were
significantly lower (P < 0.05) than those of other groups, and
also interleukin-6 concentration of the Kume nishi-yomogi was significantly
lower (P < 0.05) than that of control. The iNOS and COX-2 gene
expressions of Kume nishi-yomogi were significantly lower (P <
0.05) than those of other groups. In the case of in vivo study, the
footpad volume between groups showed no significant difference; however,
the decreased tendency of the footpad volume in Kume nishi-yomogi
was observed as compared with other groups. From these results, it
is expected that Kume nishi-yomogi extract might have a physiological
function in the alleviating inflammation.

1 Introduction
Okinawa is well known
as a longevity prefecture in Japan. Therefore,
it is of great interest to investigate the relationship between health
or longevity and the consumption of distinctive Okinawan foods. In
particular, there are many regionally specific agricultural crops
in Okinawa. Among these, 28 agricultural crops are known as “traditional
Okinawan agricultural crops (shima yasai)”, which are defined
as follows: (i) they have been used since before World War II, (ii)
they are commonly used in local cuisine, and (iii) they are suitable
for the climate of Okinawa. These crops contain relatively large amounts
of polyphenols comprising several subtypes.1

Recently, it has been suggested that the polyphenols derived
from
natural products have various physiological functions, such as antioxidant,
anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, and anticarcinogenic.2−4 However, there have been few information on the physiological effects
of polyphenols found in traditional Okinawan vegetables. Therefore,
we are currently conducting research focusing on polyphenols contained
in traditional Okinawan vegetables for anti-inflammatory, antiallergic,
anticancer, and immunostimulatory activities.

Particularly,
among physiological functions of polyphenols, anti-inflammation
is thought to be related to the antioxidant capacity of polyphenols,
as their main mechanisms involved in the inflammatory reaction are
closely associated with the derived free radicals and the oxidative
stress.5 Therefore, it is interesting if
the polyphenols contained in traditional Okinawan vegetables are involved
in anti-inflammatory responses.

Inflammation is one of the biological
responses of body tissues
to harmful stimuli and is a protective response for humans.6 It can be classified either acute or chronic
inflammation. As Hwang et al. describe in their paper,7 the inflammation is accompanied by the development of various
mediators such as nitric oxide (NO) and proinflammatory cytokines,
which are associated with the typical symptoms of inflammation such
as pain, heat, redness, swelling, and loss of function. NO is generated
by the action of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), while the proinflammatory
cytokine productions such as interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis
factor (TNF)-α are regulated by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB),7 which is a key mediator of inflammation. The
NF-κB translocates to the nucleus, where it binds with the κB-binding
site in the promoter regions of target gene and induces the transcription
of proinflammatory cytokines.

Thus, the inhibition of the NF-κB
pathway is thought to be
a mechanism that contributes to the improvement of typical symptoms
of acute or chronic inflammation.

In this paper, therefore,
we introduced the anti-inflammatory effect
of the traditional Okinawan vegetables with distinct polyphenol profiles
such as Crepidiastrum Lanceolatum Nakai
(hosoba-wadan) and two kinds of Artemisia indica Willd. var. orientalis (Pamp.) Hara hara (nishi-yomogi)
sampled from Kume and Ishigaki islands. We examined the effects of
traditional Okinawan vegetable extracts on the proinflammatory mediator
productions by mouse macrophage RAW 246 cells and the gene expressions
of NF-κB, COX-2, and iNOS that are associated with inflammation
and NO production, respectively. In addition to the in vitro study,
the carrageenin-induced footpad edema animal model was used to investigate
the effect of intraperitoneal administration of traditional Okinawan
vegetable methanol extracts on edema.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Effects of Traditional
Okinawan Vegetable
Methanol Extracts on Cell Viability
RAW264 cell viability
after addition of methanol extracts is shown in Figure 1. Cell viability or cytotoxicity was assessed
by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay. Cell viability was reduced in a concentration-dependent
manner with all vegetable extracts. All methanol extracts of Okinawan
vegetables did not show significant cytotoxicity at concentrations
of 1 μg/mL as compared with that of control. Based on these
results, all extracts were prepared at a concentration of 1 μg/mL
ethanol and were added to assess their influence on anti-inflammation.

Figure 1 Effects
of traditional Okinawan vegetable (Hosoba-wadan, Kume,
and Ishigaki nishi-yomogi) methanol extracts on cell viability. Data
are shown as means ± SEM for three treatments. A comparison with control was
conducted by the Dunnett test, and different letters were used to
indicate statistically significant differences between groups at P
< 0.05.

2.2 Polyphenol
Profiles of Hosoba-wadan, Kume,
and Ishigaki Nishi-yomogi Methanol Extracts by HPLC Analysis
The polyphenol profiles of hosoba-wadan and nishi-yomogi methanol
extracts were analyzed by HPLC (Figure 2). The primary components of the hosoba-wadan methanol
extract were chlorogenic acid, chicoric acid, and luteolin glycosides,
such as luteolin 7-O-β-d-glucopyranoside
and luteolin 7-O-β-d-glucuronide,
while those of the nishi-yomogi methanol extract were mainly composed
of chlorogenic acid, caffeoylquinic acid, and iso-chlorogenic acids,
such as 3,5-, 4,5-, and 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acids. The characteristic
difference between the polyphenol profiles of Ishigaki and Kume nishi-yomogi
was only the presence or not of an unknown peak detected at a retention
time of 22.45 min.

by
HPLC analysis. The HPLC charts show (A) hosoba-wadan, (B) Kume nishi-yomogi,
and (C) Ishigaki nishi-yomogi.

2.3 Concentrations of NO and Cytokines (IL-6 and
TNF-α) Released from RAW264 Cells
Figure 3 shows the concentrations of
NO and preinflammatory mediators, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, released
from RAW264 cells into medium. All mediator concentrations of nishi-yomogi
collected in Kume island were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than
those of other groups. These markers are well known as inflammatory
mediators and proinflammatory cytokines.9 Therefore, it is thought that the suppression of these marker productions
from RAW264 cells is associated with reduction or suppression of inflammation.
These results suggest that the Kume nishi-yomogi methanol extract
may have anti-inflammatory effect though the main components involved
in the effect could not be clearly identified.

and TNF-α) concentrations in the medium

extracts at a final concentration of 1 μg/mL. (A) NO, (B) IL-6,
and (C) TNF-α concentrations. Data are shown as means ±
SEM for three treatments. Comparison between groups was conducted
by the Tukey–Kramer test, and different letters were used to
indicate statistically significant differences between groups at P
< 0.05.

2.4 Gene
Expressions Related to Inflammation such
as iNOS, COX-2, and NF-κB
The gene expressions related
to inflammation are illustrated in Figure 4. The mRNA expression levels of iNOS and
COX-2 in the Kume nishi-yomogi group were significantly lower (P <
0.05) than those in the other groups. However, there was no significant
difference in the mRNA level of NF-κB among groups. In addition
to the effects on preinflammatory and inflammatory marker productions
of Okinawan vegetable methanol extracts, the influence of the Kume
nishi-yomogi extract was also observed on the gene expressions associated
with inflammation. NO is generated by the enzymatic action of inducible
NO synthase (iNOS) during inflammation,10 and COX-2 is an enzyme induced at the site of inflammation.11 From these results, it seems that the suppression
of inflammation marker productions by the addition of the Kume nishi-yomogi
extract to RAW264 cells is associated with the downregulation of gene
expressions related to inflammation. However, we could not detect
significant influence on the gene expression of NF-κB, which
is a nuclear transfer factor that plays a pivotal role in preinflammatory
cytokine production.

Figure 4 Effects of the traditional Okinawan vegetable methanol
extracts
on the gene expressions related to inflammation such as NF-κB
(A), iNOS (B), and COX-2 (C). RAW264 cells were treated with the extracts
of a final concentration of 1 μg/mL. Data are shown as means
± SEM for three treatments. Comparison between groups was conducted
by the Tukey–Kramer test, and different letters were used to
indicate statistically significant differences between groups at P
< 0.05.

2.5 Carrageenin-Induced
Rat Footpad Edema
As shown in Figure 5, although no significant difference was
detected in footpad edema
of rats treated with intravenous administration of vegetable extracts
among groups, intraperitoneal administration of the Kume nishi-yomogi
extract was the most effective in alleviating rat footpad edema among
all groups. The alleviative effect of edema by hosoba-wadan was less
effective than that by the Kume nishi-yomogi extract. The carrageenin-induced
footpad edema is an experimental animal model to evaluate the anti-inflammatory
medication and often used to evaluate the alleviation effect of edema
on acute inflammation.12 Unfortunately,
in this study, we could not observe significant alleviation of edema
by administration of vegetable extracts in animal models. However,
the dose of extract, timing of administration, and some other problems
have not been sufficiently studied, so these are needed to be improved
in the future.

on
carrageenin-induced rat footpad edema. Prior to induction of footpad
edema, rats were given 200 μL of 1 mg/mL extracts intraperitoneally.

3 Experimental Materials and
Methods
3.1 Polyphenol Preparation from Traditional Okinawan
Vegetables
Freeze-dried hosoba-wadan and nishi-yomogi cultivated
at Okinawa Prefecture Agricultural Research Center, Japan was extracted
twice (50 °C, 1 h) with methanol, and the solvent was evaporated. The polyphenol contents of
Okinawan vegetable methanol extracts were approximately 5 mg/g for
hosoba-wadan and 20–30 mg/g for nishi-yomogi. To adjust a concentration
of 1 mg/mL for the in vitro study, extracts were resolved with an
appropriate volume of special grade ethanol (99.5%, Wako Pure Chemical
Industries, Ltd. Osaka, Japan).

3.2 Determination
of Total Polyphenol and Polyphenol
Profiles by HPLC Analysis
The total polyphenol content of
vegetable methanol extracts was determined by the Folin–Denis
method with minor modifications (Folin et al., 1912). Briefly, a Folin
& Ciocalteu’s phenol reagent (20 μL) (Wako Pure Chemical
Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan), an aqueous solution of 10% Na2CO3 (40 μL) (Wako Pure Chemical Industries,
Ltd., Osaka, Japan), and distilled water (120 μL) were added
to 20 μL of the methanol extract and the mixture was incubated
at room temperature for 1 h under dark conditions. The absorbance
was measured at 750 nm with a spectrophotometer. An aqueous solution
of gallic acid was used as a standard.

Polyphenols in the hosoba-wadan
and nishi-yomogi methanol extracts were determined by HPLC using a
Mightysil RP-18 GP II (5 μm) column (4.6 × 250 mm2; Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., Japan) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min.
The sample was injected, and elution was performed with a system composed
of solvent A (0.1% phosphoric acid (Wako Pure Chemical Industries,
Ltd., Osaka, Japan) in water) and solvent B (0.1% phosphoric acid
in acetonitrile/methanol solution mixed at the same volume). The elution
was detected by a UV–vis detector at 280 nm. Compounds corresponding
to each peak were identified by comparison with the retention time
of reference standards and our previous report.8

3.3 Cell Culture
RAW264
cells, obtained
from the RIKEN Cell Bank (RCB0535, Tsukuba, Japan), were cultured
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (high glucose) (Wako Pure
Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) containing 10% (v/v) fetal
bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO), penicillin (100 U/mL)
(Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan), and streptomycin
(100 μg/mL) (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan)
in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Some
cells were subcultured for the MTT assay after trypsinization (0.25%
trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Wako Pure Chemical Industries,
Ltd., Osaka, Japan)). Also, the others were used to measure the productions
of inflammatory or preinflammatory markers, such as NO, IL-6, and
TNF-α, by addition of vegetable extracts.

3.4 MTT Assay for Cell Viability
RAW264
cells grown in 96-well plates (104 cells/well) were incubated
for 24 h with and without the traditional Okinawan vegetable methanol
extracts at final concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 30, and 60 μg/mL.
Controls were cultured with culture medium containing the same volume
of ethanol used as a vehicle. One hundred microliter of 0.5 mg/mL
3-(4,5-dimethylthiaxolone-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetra- zoliumbromide
(MTT) (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO) solution was added to each
well, and plates were incubated for another 2 h at 37 °C. Medium
was removed, 50 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (Wako Pure Chemical
Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) was added to each well to solubilize
formazan crystals, and absorbance was then measured at 595 nm (iMark,
BioRad, Hercules, CA). The density of formazan formed in the control
group was calculated as 100% viability.

3.5 Measurement
of NO and Cytokine (IL-6 and TNF-α)
Concentrations in the Medium
RAW264 cells were treated with
1 μg/mL of Okinawan vegetable methanol extracts for 24 h. After
incubation, the supernatant was collected and used for NO and cytokine
assays. In the case of the NO assay, the supernatants were mixed with
Griess reagent containing equal volumes of 1% sulfanilamide (Wako
Pure Chemical Industry, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) in 2.5% phosphoric acid
and 0.1% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride (Wako Pure Chemical
Industry, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) solution and then incubated at room
temperature for 10 min. The concentration of nitrite oxide was measured
by OD at 595 nm. NaNO2 (Wako Pure Chemical Industry, Ltd.,
Osaka, Japan) was used as a standard regent, while the determination
of cytokine concentrations was measured using a Quantikine enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay kit (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) for
IL-6 and TNF-α following the manufacturer’s instructions.

3.6 Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
In this study, we examined the gene expression related to inflammation
such as iNOS, COX-2, and NF-κB. Total RNA was extracted from
RAW264 cells using Trizol reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). Then, the
cDNAs were synthesized with high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription
kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Reactions were performed
with Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix and a Step One real-time PCR
system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Results were normalized
by the number of target DNA copies to that of β-actin gene by
simplification of the comparative threshold cycle (ΔΔCt) method. Rat-specific primer pairs are listed Table 1.

3.7 Carrageenin-Induced Rat Footpad Edema
Male Sprague
Dawley rats weighning 160–180 g were purchased
from Japan SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). They were individually housed at
23 ± 1 °C on a 12 h light cycle and with free access to
commercial chaw (CE-2, Crea Japan Inc., Japan) and tap water. This
experiment was conducted in compliance with the ethical guidelines
of the Fukuoka Institute of Technology Animal Care and Use Committee
(approval number: 20180925-0001).

Prior to carrageenin administration,
rats were treated with 200 μL of 1 mg/mL extracts by intraperitoneal
administration. Two hours later, footpad edema was induced in the
hind right paw of rat by an intraplantar injection of 100 μL
of freshly prepared carrageenin (1% solution in sterile saline). Edema
was measured with the use of a plethysmometer (model MK-101 P, Muromachi
Kikai Co., Ltd., Japan) at 1 h intervals up to 4 h after carrageenin
injection. The results are expressed by volume as the difference of
swelling before and after carrageenin administration.

3.8 Statistical Analysis
Data are shown
as means ± SEM (standard errors of the mean). In the case of
the MTT assay, data were assessed by one-way analysis of variance
and then each value was compared with that of control group by the
Dunnett test. For other results, the Tukey–Kramer test was
done for comparisons between groups. Differences were considered to
be significant at P < 0.05.

4 Conclusions
The results of in vitro study are summarized in Figure 6. In the case of in vitro study,
we observed that the addition of the Kume nishi-yomogi methanol extract
to RAW264 cells significantly reduced productions of the inflammatory
mediators, such as NO and cytokines, and downregulated the gene expressions
of enzymes related to the inflammation, such as iNOS and COX-2. However,
in the case of in vivo study, we could not detect significant efficiency
of Okinawan vegetable extracts on the reduction of footpad edema in
the carrageenin-induced animal model.

Figure 6 Estimated scheme from in vitro study for
anti-inflammatory effect
of traditional Okinawan vegetable methanol extracts.

In addition to these studies, we are currently considering
the
influence of toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 and NF-κB expressions
using Western blot analysis. Moreover, in the future, we plan to verify
the active components and examine the effects of daily intake of traditional
Okinawan vegetables on chronic inflammation.
