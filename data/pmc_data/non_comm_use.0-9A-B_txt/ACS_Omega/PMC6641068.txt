Using
a conventional Raman experimental apparatus, we demonstrate
that the photoluminescent (PL) yield from ultrasonication-exfoliated
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) (MoS2 and WS2) can be increased by up to 8-fold by means of a laser etching
procedure. This laser etching process allows us to controllably pattern
and reduce the number of layers of the solution-exfoliated material,
overcoming the key drawback to solvent-based exfoliation of two-dimensional
(2D) semiconducting materials for applications in optoelectronics.
The successful laser thinning of the exfoliated 2D crystals was investigated
systematically by changes in both Raman and PL spectra. A simple proof-of-principle
of the scalability of this laser etching technique for solution-exfoliated
TMD crystals was also demonstrated. As well as being applicable for
individual materials, it is also possible to use this simple laser
etching technique to investigate the structure of solution-generated
van der Waals heterostructures, consisting of layers of both MoS2 and WS2.

Introduction
Research into two-dimensional
(2D) materials has continued to gain
interest, first with graphene and then with other layered materials,
such as the semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),
molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), and tungsten disulfide (WS2).1−4 TMDs are of particular interest due to their unique electronic structure,
and they exhibit a significant change in the band structure when reduced
in thickness from bulk (indirect gap) to a monolayer (direct gap).5−7 The transition to a direct gap semiconductor means that photons
with an energy equal to the band gap can be easily absorbed or emitted,
whereas the indirect band gap material requires an additional phonon
absorption or emission to compensate for the difference in the momentum,
making absorption much less efficient.8 This change in electronic structure can typically be experimentally
detected by a large increase in the photoluminescent (PL) quantum
yield due to the increased efficiency of the direct band gap monolayer
material.9,10 This unique optical property is particularly
important for photonic and optoelectronic applications including photovoltaics,
light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, and displays.6,7,11 Because of the atomically thin
nature, it may also be possible to develop flexible and transparent
optoelectronics.

Exfoliated monolayer TMDs can be produced by
several methods including
micromechanical exfoliation,1 chemical
vapor deposition (CVD),12−14 chemical exfoliation,15 electrochemical lithium intercalation,16−18 and solvent-assisted ultrasonication.19,20 Mechanical
exfoliation produces the highest-quality crystals, with lateral dimensions
of over 50 μm possible; however, the method is expensive, time
consuming, and cannot be easily scaled for commercial applications.
CVD growth can also produce high-quality large-area films of TMDs
and can be scaled with continued progress, but it is also expensive
and requires high temperatures for the growth, which limits the available
substrates. Solvent exfoliation by ultrasonication, in contrast, is
the only current method for economical production of large volumes
of dispersed TMD sheets; however, the biggest drawback to solvent
exfoliation is the reduced quality of the subsequent flakes due to
the small lateral size, residual solvent, and a low monolayer content.
Because of the low monolayer content, combined with the effect of
contamination from the residual solvent molecules, very few studies
have reported the PL response from ultrasonically exfoliated TMD flakes.
To increase the applicability of the ultrasonic production method
for use in optoelectronic applications, some form of post-processing
is required to tune the layered structure.

It has previously
been demonstrated that both mechanically exfoliated21 and CVD-grown films22,23 of MoS2 can
be thinned by laser etching in a controllable
and reproducible manner using a simple laser setup, allowing for control
over the number of layers as well as patterning into desired shapes.
A similar process of laser etching has also previously been applied
to other 2D materials such as graphene24 and black phosphorus.25,26 However, its application
to solution-exfoliated TMDs would allow for a truly scalable production
of efficient optoelectronic devices. The use of a laser etching process
to perform the thinning and patterning of the sample has the benefit
of avoiding the need for chemical photoresists or masks that can contaminate
the flakes and alter the electronic structure. The mechanism behind
the etching has been attributed to thermal sublimation of the upper
TMD layers, with the heat being poorly dissipated through the structure
due to weak van der Waals cohesive forces.21,22 Because of this heat sink effect, the bottommost lasers directly
in contact with the Si/SiO2 wafer become increasingly difficult
to remove and require an increased laser dosage when the laser irradiation
is performed under ambient conditions. In addition to thermal sublimation
of the crystals, there have been some reports of partial oxidation
of the material (e.g., conversion of MoS2 into MoO3) due to the etching being performed under ambient conditions.22 Chemical doping can also occur due to the freshly
etched TMD layers being exposed to ambient atmospheric conditions
(e.g., O2, H2O, and N2). Previously,
it has been observed that laser irradiation under ambient conditions
leads to oxygen and water doping of the MoS2 film and subsequent
improvement of the photocurrent response.22 Doping of the n-type semiconducting TMDs (e.g., MoS2 and
WS2) by exposure to atmospherics molecules, such as O2 and H2O, is known to contribute to the enhancement
of the PL intensity due to electron withdrawal by the dopant molecules
stabilizing excitons and providing a new radiative recombination pathway.27,28 This combined effect of chemical doping and morphological thinning
can lead to an effective engineering of the electronic structure as
well as providing tuning of the thickness.29 This is of particular importance as chemical doping can be used
to effectively tune the optoelectronic properties of the exfoliated
flakes.

Heterostructures
of different semiconducting 2D materials are also of great interest
because of the ability to modify the electronic structure, thus introducing
novel properties, and because of the fundamental interactions between
each of the layers stacked together by van der Waals forces.30−32 Owing to the close interaction between each of the exfoliated layers,
it is possible for excited electrons and holes to transfer between
the respective layers. These heterostructures have been demonstrated
experimentally using mechanically exfoliated flakes manually stacked
on top of one another;33−35 however, this process is time consuming and lacks
scalability. In addition to manual stacking, CVD-grown films grown
on top of one another have been realized;36−38 this technique
shows promise but remains difficult to control and has a limited number
of suitable growth substrates.

Here, we demonstrate that the
PL intensity of solvent-exfoliated
dispersions of both MoS2 and the similarly structured WS2 can be significantly increased (up to 8×), overcoming
the key drawback of solvent-based exfoliation for applications in
optoelectronics, by reducing the number of layers in a scalable manner.
The optical properties of the flakes before and after etching are
thoroughly characterized using Raman and PL spectroscopy, and the
morphology of the flakes is analyzed using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM). The laser etching of the solution-exfoliated TMD flakes is
easily scalable as demonstrated over an arbitrary 250 μm ×
250 μm area and can be applied to a wide variety of similarly
structured 2D layered materials. We also investigate the properties
of mixed dispersions of exfoliated MoS2 and WS2 flakes to create heterostructures. After depositing onto a silicon
substrate, mixed heterostructures consisting of randomly stacked MoS2 and WS2 flakes are formed with differing thicknesses
and stacking orders. The resultant stacks can then be modified through
the use of laser etching, and the resultant 3D layered structure can
be characterized.

Results and Discussion
After the
formation of solvent-stabilized dispersions, the TMD
flakes can then be deposited onto Si/SiO2 wafers to act
as a supporting substrate. The deposited flakes can form aggregates
with lateral sizes of several microns, as seen in the typical optical
image of the WS2 flakes in Figure 1b, wherein repeated deposition was used to
ensure that large-scale aggregates were clearly visible. A confocal
Raman setup was used as both the etching laser source and the characterization
tool, allowing rapid characterization of the same areas before and
after etching. Etching was achieved by rastering the laser with a
high incident power density over a designated area as seen schematically
in Figure 1a. By controlling
the exposure time, laser power, and scanning over designated areas
in repeated cycles, it was possible to etch away the TMD flakes. After
etching there is a clear change in the optical contrast of the deposited
flakes, as seen in Figure 1c, indicating a reduction in the thickness of the flakes,
and this can be used to approximate the thickness of the flakes.39 When we compare the PL spectrum of the aggregated
flakes before etching to that of the same area after the laser etching,
as seen in Figure 1d, we see that there is a significant improvement in the signal intensity
due to the reduced thickness of the flakes. Because of the large variation
in the initial thickness of the aggregated flakes, some areas are
reduced in thickness more than others. This
is due to the mechanism of the laser etching, as the incoming laser
light is absorbed and converted to heat, and the poor interlayer coupling
causes the uppermost layers to be sublimed. The thinner flakes are
in better thermal contact with the underlying substrate and can more
strongly resist the localized heating.21,40 Thus, the
rate of etching is more pronounced on the thicker flakes compared
to that of the thinner flakes for an equal exposure time.

solution-exfoliated TMD layers. (b–c) Optical images showing
a patch of agglomerated WS2 flakes deposited on a SiO2 wafer; the area marked by the box shows the obvious change
in thickness, and consequently optical contrast after laser etching
is performed. (d) PL spectra of the same area before (black) and after
(red) laser etching showing the significant increase in signal intensity.

After the ultrasonic exfoliation,
the average MoS2 and
WS2 flake dimensions are on the order of 200–300
nm, making them smaller than the size of the laser spot (∼1
μm); this increases the exposure of the more reactive edges
to the laser and may lead to the selective removal of highly defective
edge structures. A similar effect has been observed previously for
graphene films, which showed that, contrary to expectations, after
laser etching the defect-related D band decreased in intensity due
to selective removal of the highly reactive edges and defect sites.24

To further investigate the applicability
of this laser etching
procedure on solution-exfoliated TMD flakes, a thick coating of exfoliated
WS2 was deposited onto a Si/SiO2 wafer and laser
etched before analysis. Figure 2a shows an SEM image of the WS2 flakes aggregated
on the substrate after laser etching. The
area (∼20 μm × 20 μm) where the laser was
rastered is clearly noticeable, indicating that this technique can
be applied to large-scale samples as well as individual nanocrystals
with a size of several hundred nanometers. By measuring the Raman
spectrum across every point over this area, we can create a map of
the E2g intensity and compare how this changes across the
etched area, as seen in Figure 2b. Clearly, there is reduced signal intensity from inside
the laser-etched area, indicating the reduced thickness of the flakes.
Interestingly, no peaks associated with tungsten oxides, WO341 (or molybdenum oxide, MoO3, in the case of MoS2), were observed for the thin flakes,
indicating that the etching process does not destroy the WS2 or MoS2 structure. However, in some areas of the thicker
flakes, oxide peaks were occasionally detected (see Figure S2). The PL intensity was also mapped across the etched
area, as seen in Figure 2c, and we see again an increased signal intensity within the etched
areas. These results demonstrate that laser etching of solution-exfoliated
TMDs can be performed over a designated area of an arbitrary size.

laser etching of a 20 μm × 20 μm area. (b) Map showing

PL spectra of the WS2 (d) and MoS2 (e) flakes
with repeated laser etching. The as-deposited flakes are shown in
green, followed by one cycle of laser etching in red and a second
cycle of laser etching in black. The spectra in each figure are fitted
with Lorentzian components, with the peak center labeled along with
the full width at half-maximum (fwhm) (meV) in parentheses. The peak
intensity has been normalized to the intensity of the Raman A1g peak in each case. Insets show the optical image of the
individual flakes before laser etching; the scale bar in each inset
is 2 μm.

To further investigate
this systematically, low-concentration dispersions
were used to create small aggregates that were etched repeatedly,
and the PL spectra were measured. The PL spectrum, normalized to the
height of the A1g Raman peak, of both the solution-exfoliated
WS2 and MoS2 flakes, after dilution and deposition
onto a silicon wafer, are shown in green in Figure 2d. Optical images showing the individual
flakes as opposed to the large-scale aggregates are shown in the insets.
The monolayer WS2 PL emission typically contains a single
peak, originating from the A exciton at ∼1.95 eV.8,42 The as-deposited WS2 flakes shown in Figure 2d show a single low-intensity
peak in the PL spectrum centered at 648 nm (1.91 eV), which corresponds
to the energy expected for an approximately three-layer-thick WS2 flake.42 The fwhm of the PL peak
can also provide information regarding the electronic structure of
the TMD flakes. Typically, the fwhm of monolayer WS2 is
∼50–75 meV and that of MoS2 is ∼90
meV.8,27,42,43 However, this value can vary depending on the doping
of the flake and the localized strain or defects. The calculated fwhm
(in meV) is shown in parentheses in Figure 2d,e for both the WS2 and the MoS2 flakes. For the as-deposited WS2 flakes (shown
in green, Figure 2d),
the fwhm is much larger than expected for the monolayer at ∼150
meV, again indicative of ∼3–5 layers. However, after
laser etching of the WS2 flakes there is a significant
change in the PL response. After the first cycle of laser etching
(shown in red), we notice a significant increase in the PL intensity,
as may be expected due to the combination of reduced flake thickness
combined with chemical doping by freshly exposing the etched surface
to an ambient atmosphere, as mentioned previously.27 The increase in the PL intensity after the first laser-etching
cycle is by a factor of 5, and after repeated etching (shown in black),
it increases further by a factor of 8 compared to that of the as-deposited
flakes. This is a significant increase in the photoresponse of the
solution-exfoliated flakes and could be valuable for use in applications
in which the solution-exfoliated WS2 flakes can be mass-produced
and easily deposited as films on surfaces, followed by laser etching
to increase the photoresponse as demonstrated previously for CVD-grown
films.22 As mentioned previously, as the
laser etching removes the topmost WS2 layers, it freshly
exposes the underlying layer, providing a highly reactive surface
that is rapidly passivated by atmospheric oxygen and water; these
dopants increase the free carrier concentration of the WS2 flakes, which can also increase the PL intensity. The width of the
peaks also narrows significantly with laser etching, decreasing from
∼150 meV for the as-deposited flakes, to ∼70 meV after
the first etching cycle, and finally to ∼66 meV after the second
etching cycle, in agreement with the reduced number of layers and
indicating the high quality of the thinned flakes.

To verify
that the laser etching treatment is indeed reducing the
thickness of the flakes, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to
statistically measure the thickness of a number of individual WS2 flakes before and after laser etching (see Figure S3). These flakes were prepared in the identical manner
as described previously and deposited onto Si/SiO2 wafers
for analysis. It was found that after a single cycle of laser etching
the average thickness of the flakes was decreased significantly, in
agreement with the spectroscopic results. Also noticeable was the
exposure of terrace-like structures within the thicker flakes. This
indicates that the etching mechanism removes the uppermost layers
preferentially before the lower layers.

A similar trend in PL
response is observed for the MoS2 flake, as seen in Figure 2e. Initially, the
as-deposited MoS2 flakes, shown
in green, consist of two separate peaks referred to as the A and B
excitons.9,10 Similar to the WS2 flakes, the
as-deposited PL response of the solution-exfoliated MoS2 exhibits a low intensity and very broad peaks, due to the thickness
of the aggregated flakes. The literature values for the PL response
for the monolayer MoS2 flakes are 670 nm (∼1.85
eV) for the A exciton and 620 nm (∼2.00 eV) separated by ∼145
meV due to spin–orbit band splitting.5,9,10,15 The PL response
of the as-deposited flakes in Figure 2e matches fairly closely to the expected peak positions.
After laser etching, the PL response of the MoS2 flakes
increases in intensity and narrows in width, indicating the reduced
thickness of the flakes. After etching, the PL intensity increases
initially by a factor of 1.5 and then by a factor of 2 compared to
that of the as-deposited flakes. This is a lower enhancement of the
PL intensity when compared to that of the WS2 flakes and
indicates that the PL enhancement is more effective in the case of
the WS2 flakes. This may also be related to the lower inherent
PL intensity achieved by the MoS2 flakes compared to that
by the WS2 flakes, making it more difficult to resolve
the effects of atmospheric doping.

To systematically analyze
the etching process on the solvent-exfoliated
flakes, we can also look at the changes to the Raman spectra. Figure 3 shows the Raman
spectra of the bulk powder and the solution-exfoliated WS2 (a, b) and MoS2 (c, d) flakes deposited onto the SiO2 wafers after solvent removal. Low-concentration dispersions
were used to minimize aggregation and allow the investigation of individual
flakes. In Figure 3a, the Raman spectrum of WS2 is shown with each of the
peaks fitted with Lorentzian curves and labeled on the basis of literature
peak assignments. The most significant peaks are the first-order A1g (out-of-plane phonon) and E12g (in-plane
phonon) peaks that have been studied in detail previously; we also
observe a rich variety of second-order peaks of WS2, which
are labeled according to the literature.44 When we compare the spectrum of the bulk crystal to that of the
solution-exfoliated flakes, we can immediately see a large difference
in the intensity ratio of the A1g and the overlapping E12g and 2LA peaks. This intensity ratio can be used
to determine the number of WS2 layers present in the sample,
as this ratio increases as the flakes are reduced in thickness.44,45 In the spectra shown in Figure 3a, the I2LA/IA1g ratio is 0.8 for the bulk sample, whereas
it is 3.4 for the exfoliated flake, indicating the few-layered (∼2–3)
structure. With continued laser-etching cycles the amount of material
is reduced, and this leads to a decrease in the signal intensity after
each cycle. Thus, the spectra shown have been normalized to the intensity
of the A1g peak to allow for easy comparison. Figure 3b shows the Raman
spectra of the as-deposited ultrasonication-exfoliated WS2 flake, as well as after successive cycles of laser etching. When
we compare the frequency of the Raman peaks after etching, we see
very little shift in the peak position; however, we do see a change
in the I2LA/IA1g ratio with continued etching. After the first etching
cycle, the I2LA/IA1g ratio increases significantly to 5.1, and with
the next etching cycle it increases slightly more to 5.2, indicating
the reduced thickness of the deposited WS2 flakes.

Figure 3 (a) Comparison

(blue) and the solution-exfoliated WS2 flakes (black) after
deposition onto SiO2, along with Lorentzian fitting and
labeling according to literature peak assignments.44 (b) Raman spectra of the same WS2 flake after
repeated laser etching. The spectra are normalized to the intensity
of the A1g peak. (c) Comparison of the Raman spectra of
the bulk MoS2 powder (blue) and the solution-exfoliated
MoS2 flakes (black) after deposition onto SiO2, along with Lorentzian fitting and labeling according to literature
peak assignments.47 (d) Raman spectra of
the same MoS2 flake after repeated laser etching. The spectra
are normalized to the intensity of the A1g peak.

Figure 3c shows
the comparison between the Raman spectrum of the bulk MoS2 powder and the subsequent exfoliated flake, with the A1g and E12g phonon peaks labeled. We see a significant
shift in the peak frequency when we compare the spectra before and
after exfoliation, and this matches previous observations for similarly
produced solution-exfoliated flakes.46 This
shift in phonon frequency is caused by the reduction in the number
of layers of the MoS2 and can be used to determine the
thickness of the exfoliated flakes.47,48 As seen in
the case of WS2, the as-deposited exfoliated MoS2 flakes are predominantly few layered (∼2–3 layers),
as expected from literature based on the sonication time and the centrifuge
conditions used.49Figure 3d shows the Raman spectra of an as-deposited
MoS2 flake with repeated laser etching, similar to the
WS2 flake, seen previously. These spectra were obtained
in the same x–y position
after etching to ensure that the same flake was being analyzed. Again
there is very little noticeable shift in the position of the peaks
with continued laser etching. However, although the shift in the Raman
frequency is only minor for both the WS2 and the MoS2 flakes, we do see a significant change in the PL spectra
after the laser etching as discussed previously.

As discussed
previously, there is also a great deal of interest
in the formation of vertically stacked van der Waals heterostructures,
due to the unique electronic structure that can be formed through
the nonradiative transfer of excitons within each layer.30−32,34−38 By creating these heterostructures by solution exfoliation,
the interaction between the two materials can be analyzed easily.
To investigate these heterostructures, dispersions of both exfoliated
MoS2 and WS2 nanocrystals were mixed together
and deposited onto substrates to create a series of heterostructures
with random interlayer stacking as discussed in further detail in
the Supporting Information (Figure S3).

Large-Scale
Etching
The key benefits of using solvent-based exfoliation
over the previously
demonstrated mechanical exfoliation and CVD growth of TMDs include
both the low cost and the simple scalability. By creating large volumes
of solvent-stabilized flakes and subsequently drop-casting or spin-coating
them onto desired substrates, it is possible to demonstrate the large-scale
applicability of this method. Previous examples showing a similar
laser-etching process have only demonstrated this over comparatively
small areas of several 10 s of micrometers due to sample size limitations.21,22 In Figure 4, we demonstrate
a proof-of-principle for the scalability of using liquid-exfoliated
material by first simply drop-casting WS2 flakes over a
silicon wafer to create a large-scale coverage, which was then laser
etched over a designated ∼250 μm × 250 μm
area. Figure 4a shows
the optical image of the etched area showing the distinct difference
in optical contrast where the laser was rastered. Because of the use
of simple drop-casting to deposit the flakes, there is a random assortment
of thicknesses present on the surface; however, as the laser etching
appears to more effectively remove thicker flakes due to poor thermal
conductivity with the underlying substrate, repeated etching cycles
can be used to produce an area of an approximately similar thickness. Figure 4b shows the SEM image
of the same area where laser etching has occurred. In Figure 4c, an area of increased magnification
shows the interface between the pristine as-deposited flakes and the
laser-etched material, indicating a change in flake morphology. The
selective etching of the crystal edges is also visible as the laser-etched
flakes are seen to all have smoother edges than the pristine flakes
as well as a reduced thickness. With further optimization, such as
carefully controlling the initial concentration of the TMD dispersion
and deposition conditions, it would be possible to create homogenous
large-scale coatings that could then be post-processed using this
laser-etching technique to enhance their mobility21 and sensitivity to photons22 or be patterned for further functionalization.23,50

interface between the laser-etched and pristine deposited WS2 flakes.

Experimental Section
Dispersions
of MoS2 and WS2 were produced
following the established literature protocols.19,49 Briefly, commercially available TMD powders (MoS2 and
WS2) were each suspended in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) at a concentration of 10 mg mL–1. To investigate the effect of the residual solvent,
similar dispersions were also produced using a mixed solvent system
of isopropanol (IPA) and water in a ratio of 7:3 (MoS2)
or 1:1 (WS2) as this has previously been shown to match
the exfoliation performance of NMP.51,52 The suspension
was then bath sonicated (Elmasonic P, 40% power, 37 kHz) for 12 h
at a constant temperature of 20 °C. The resultant dispersion
was then centrifuged at 6000 rpm (3139g) for 30 min,
and the supernatant was decanted to provide a stable TMD dispersion.
This technique has been shown to produce a distribution of flake sizes
and thicknesses, ranging from a monolayer up to several layers (3–5)
thick with lateral dimensions of 200–300 nm.19,49 To characterize the flakes, the NMP suspension was first diluted
by a factor of ∼50 in IPA to minimize the NMP and prevent agglomeration
before drop-casting onto Si/SiO2 wafers. The residual solvent
was first evaporated on a hot plate at 50 °C before transferring
into a vacuum oven and annealed at 200 °C at a pressure of 5
× 10–5 mbar to ensure thorough removal of the
residual solvent. This vacuum annealing step was found to be vital
in achieving the enhanced PL intensity after the laser etching, as
without this step the residual solvent (NMP) molecules that are trapped
between the TMD layers cause a large amount of amorphous carbon to
appear in the Raman spectrum (seen in Figure S1). This amorphous carbon significantly suppresses the PL intensity
of the MoS2 or WS2 flakes; however, after the
vacuum annealing very little to no amorphous carbon was detected after
the laser etching, indicating the successful removal of trapped solvent
molecules and the increased cleanliness of the TMD flakes. In contrast,
the IPA/H2O dispersions were deposited as prepared onto
the Si/SiO2 wafers and left to dry, and little to no amorphous
carbon was detected after etching.

Confocal Raman spectroscopy
and PL measurements were conducted
using a Renishaw inVia microscope with a 532 nm (2.33 eV) excitation
at a power of 1.8 mW with a 100× objective and a grating of 1800
l/mm to achieve a spectral resolution of ∼1 cm–1. Laser etching was performed using the same Raman setup, but with
an incident laser power of ∼20 mW (power density: ∼2.45
MW cm–2). The laser was rastered over a designated
area in 500 nm steps with a typical exposure time of 100 ms per step,
although this could be increased as desired. For the large etching
area, a lower magnification objective was used (20×), and a longer
exposure time (∼1 s) compensated for the lower power density.
The morphology of the flakes after etching, as well as the individual
crystal flake size of the TMDC materials, was characterized using
a Philips/FEI XL30 FEG ESEM SEM. All images were obtained with an
accelerating voltage of 15 kV, under high vacuum conditions utilizing
secondary electron detection. AFM images were taken using a Bruker
Multimode using the PeakForce Tapping mode under ambient conditions.
After acquiring images of the pristine flakes, the sample was laser
etched using the same conditions listed previously.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated that using a conventional Raman experimental
setup it is possible to enhance the PL yield, by up to 8-fold, of
ultrasonication-exfoliated MoS2 and WS2 using
a simple laser-etching procedure. This laser-etching procedure, which
had previously only been applied for mechanically exfoliated and CVD-grown
MoS2, has been demonstrated to be applicable for other
solution-exfoliated 2D materials. The mechanism behind this PL improvement
is a combination of the thinning of the material through thermal sublimation
of the uppermost layers and atmospheric doping by H2O and
O2 that occurs on the freshly exposed surface. This technique
allows the cheap and scalable production of optoelectronic devices,
which require the high quantum yield that monolayer flakes of these
TMDs provide, while still using solution-based exfoliation. A simple
proof-of-principle of the scalability of this laser-etching technique
for solution-exfoliated TMD crystals was also demonstrated, indicating
that there are many applications in which this would be beneficial,
such as, photodetectors or other optoelectronics. Finally, this laser-etching
technique was used to modify heterostructures (MoS2 and
WS2) produced by mixing dispersions of each TMD, providing
information about the structure and the ability to tune the optical
properties as desired.
