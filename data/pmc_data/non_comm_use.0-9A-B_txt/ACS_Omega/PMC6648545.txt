Efficient
synthesis of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) using glucose
(Glc) as a starting material represents an important process in biomass
transformation. In this study, novel bifunctional porous coordination
polymer (PCP) catalysts [PCP(Cr)-NH2–x(CH3)x; x = 0, 1, or 2] containing Lewis acidic and Lewis basic sites have
been synthesized and utilized as solid-phase catalysts for HMF synthesis
starting from a Glc-in-water system. PCP(Cr)-NH2 was found
as the optimal catalyst, with an HMF yield of 65.9% and Glc conversion
of 99.9% in a water/tetrahydrofuran (THF) system. Compared with PCP(Cr),
amino groups in PCP(Cr)-NH2 catalysts play a vital role
in Glc isomerization and subsequent dehydration–cyclization
process to obtain the highly selective and effective fructose-to-HMF
conversion. High yield and chemoselectivity are ascribed to concurrent
extraction of HMF into the THF layer just upon its formation in water.
The mechanism of Lewis acid–base synergistic catalysis was
deduced by means of infrared spectroscopy, and catalysts could be
reused after simple washing procedure with high reproducibility.

1 Introduction
The
production of high-value-added chemicals from biomass-derived
carbohydrates represents a promising direction in biomass transformation.
5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is identified as a biobased, renewable
compound and versatile precursor for the manufacture of liquid fuels,
polymers, and functional small molecules.1−3 The elimination
of water from hexoses [such as glucose (Glc)4,5 and
fructose (Fru)6,7] over acid catalysts yields HMF.
Among all hexoses, Fru is the most efficient feedstock for HMF preparation.
However, large-scale production of HMF from Fru is restricted due
to its high price. In respect to Fru, Glc is significantly more abundant
in nature and therefore cheaper, making it more attractive material
for producing HMF.1

The conversion
of Glc into HMF is a two-step process and involves
isomerization of Glc into Fru and subsequent dehydration to HMF. Glc–Fru
isomerization is an essential step in this process and can be catalyzed
by bases with <40% yields.8−10 On the other hand, the Fru dehydration
proceeds smoothly when catalyzed by Brønsted acids.6,11,12 Therefore, a high-performance
acid–base catalyst should be able to catalyze Glc isomerization
and Fru dehydration simultaneously.

A combination of Brønsted
acids and bases in catalytical systems
for the improvement of the efficiency of HMF synthesis from Glc is
already reported. Mednick combined two homogeneous acid and base catalysts
in different media. In water, only 23% of HMF was produced by combining
H3PO4 and (NH4)2HPO4 catalysts. In the water–dioxane system, HMF was obtained
in 46% yield over H3PO4/pyridine at the temperature
above 200 °C.13 However, the utilization
of homogeneous acid–base catalysts has serious deficiencies
such as corrosion, increased hazards during handling, waste production
and management, and poor reusability. Thus, the application of heterogeneous
catalysts has gained much attention. Takagaki et al. performed one-pot
Glc-to-HMF conversion catalyzed by two Brønsted acid (Amberlyst-15)
and base (Mg-Al hydrotalcite, HT) catalysts in dimethylformamide (DMF),
with HMF yield of 42.3% at 73% Glc conversion after 9 h at 80 °C.14 Yue and co-workers found that the layered zirconosilicate
Na2ZrSi4O11 also shows good catalytic
activity toward Glc-to-Fru isomerization in H2O, under
mild reaction conditions.15 In the H2O/tetrahydrofuran (THF) biphasic system at 180 °C, 39.2%
of HMF was obtained within 90 min at 87% Glc conversion, using Na2ZrSi4O11 and Amberlyst-15 catalysts.

Moreover, catalysts with both Brønsted acidic and basic sites
have been used in dehydration of Glc into HMF. The acid and base groups
coexisted without neutralization, confirming the concept of isolated
reactive sites.16 Several highly acidic
and moderately basic catalysts based on SO42–/ZrO2–Al2O3 (CSZA) were prepared
and applied in Glc-to-HMF transformation.17 The maximum HMF yield (48%) was achieved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
solution at 130 °C after 240 min, using CSZA-3 catalyst with
a 1:1 molar ratio of Zr/Al. As discussed previously, the combination
of Lewis basic and Brønsted acidic functional groups in one catalyst
could facilitate Glc-to-Fru isomerization as well as subsequent elimination
of water from Fru and HMF formation. To the best of our knowledge,
the literature lacks precise descriptions concerning the application
of bifunctional materials with milder and more eco-friendly Lewis
basic and Lewis acidic sites as the catalysts for the synthesis of
HMF where Glc is a starting material.

A porous coordination
polymer (PCP) comprises metal ions coordinated
to different organic ligands and has been extensively tested as a
heterogeneous catalyst owing to its large surface area, adjustable
pore size, and easily adaptable structure.4 One of the most representative materials of this class is PCP(Cr),
a crystalline structure with coordinating organic molecules and Cr
ions, which has large pores and excellent thermal and chemical stabilities
toward water and is commonly soluble in organic solvents.18 The obtained PCP(Cr) material can be used as
an adjustable catalyst support and designed by sulfonic acid functionalization
or guest species encapsulation meet the needs of biomass catalysis.4,19,20 The improvement of catalytic
efficiency upon the introduction of amino groups in the structure
of PCP(Cr) for the transformation of Glc to HMF is hypothesized.

In this study, we synthesized several bifunctional PCP catalysts,
which contain −NH2 groups as Lewis base functionalities
and Cr(III) clusters as the Lewis acid sites, via the one-pot hydrothermal
method. Their structures were identified by Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy–energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (SEM–EDS), N2 adsorption/desorption,
thermogravimetry (TG), CO2/NH3-temperature-programmed
desorption (TPD), etc., followed by the systematic study of usability
as heterogeneous catalysts for HMF production from Glc in an aqueous
environment. Along with this, a possible reaction mechanism and the
reusability of catalyst were examined.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Bifunctional
Catalysts
New PCP(Cr)-based compounds described herein were
synthesized by
the one-pot, multisubstrate hydrothermal method. The problem of low
content of −NH2 groups, typical for the traditional
postsynthetic modification, was solved with this new method using
5-aminoisophthalic acid (5-AIPA) with inherent −NH2 groups.21

The FTIR spectra of PCP(Cr)-based
catalysts are illustrated in Figure 1. Compared with 5-AIPA, no intensive absorption peaks
at ∼1720 cm–1 originating from the −COOH
group are present, which implies that the carboxyl groups are completely
deprotonated and complexed with Cr(III) ions.22 Different from the spectrum of PCP(Cr) (Figure 1b), two characteristic bands at 3389 and
3184 cm–1 appear in the spectrum of the catalyst
PCP(Cr)-NH2 (Figure 1a), which can be associated with the N–H asymmetric
stretching vibration of −NH2.23,24 This result indicates that the amino groups were retained in the
structure of the catalyst and can act as a Lewis base site in a Glc-to-HMF
transformation. In the spectra of PCP(Cr)-N(CH3)2 (Figure 1c) and PCP(Cr)-NHCH3 (Figure 1d),
the peaks at 2976 and 2926 cm–1 originating from
the C–H stretching vibrations of the −CH3 group were observed,23 showing that PCP(Cr)-NHCH3 and PCP(Cr)-N(CH3)2 are successfully
prepared by the aminomethylation of PCP(Cr)-NH2.

Figure 1 FTIR spectra
of (a) PCP(Cr)-NH2, (b) PCP(Cr), (c) PCP(Cr)-N(CH3)2, and (d) PCP(Cr)-NHCH3.

Figure 2a
shows
the XRD patterns of PCP(Cr)-based catalysts. PCP(Cr)-NH2, PCP(Cr)-NHCH3, and PCP(Cr)-N(CH3)2 exhibited a typical diffraction pattern of PCP(Cr), which indicated
successful formation of the PCP(Cr) crystal structure in the amination-modified
PCP(Cr)-based catalysts. The peaks for (110) could be ascribed to
Cr3+O(OH) [space group: Pbmn (62)], and
such data correlate well with the JCPDS data for bracewellite (JCPDS
25-1497). In the X-ray photoelectron spectrum of chromium (Cr 2p, Figure 2b), the binding energy
of about 577 eV suggests that Cr3+ ions were found in the
passive surface layer and can be attributed to CrOOH, which corroborate
XRD analysis.

Figure 2 (a) XRD patterns and (b) XP spectrum of PCP(Cr)-based
catalysts.

The morphology of PCP(Cr)-NH2 was characterized using
SEM–EDS and TEM. The elemental analysis and particle-size distribution
of all polymers were also determined. The SEM image of PCP(Cr)-NH2 (Figure 3a)
shows that the microspheres are constituted of many smaller particles
with an average diameter of 15 nm. The TEM image (Figure 3b) reveals overlapped small
particles in different degrees. The structure of PCP(Cr) (Figure S1) is octahedral, with the side-size
of 800–1000 nm. Different from that of PCP(Cr), the structure
of PCP(Cr)-NH2 is affected by the amino groups of 5-AIPA,
which influence the steric hindrance and supramolecular structure
in a crystal packing. The element distribution of carbon (C), nitrogen
(N), and chromium (Cr) of PCP(Cr)-NH2 was also investigated
by EDS (Figure 3c),
and N was detectable with the content of 1.57%.

Figure 3 (a) SEM image, (b) TEM
image, (c) EDS spectrum, and (d) particle-size
distribution images of the PCP(Cr)-NH2 catalyst.

The acidity and basicity of the
PCP(Cr)-NH2 catalyst
were quantified by NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD, respectively
(Table 1). A total
of 0.038 mmol of acidic sites per gram of PCP(Cr)-NH2 was
calculated; the corresponding value for PCP(Cr) is 0.04 mmol g–1. There were no basic sites in PCP(Cr) (0 mmol g–1 found), whereas PCP(Cr)-NH2 contained
0.036 mmol of basic sites per gram of the catalyst, representing a
Lewis basicity peak. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
surface area of ∼228 m2 g–1 was
obtained for PCP(Cr)-NH2 using N2 adsorption/desorption
isotherms (Figure S2a), which was less
than the value for PCP(Cr) (857 m2 g–1, Table 1). The average
pore size of PCP(Cr)-NH2 was 4.62 nm, larger than the pore
diameters of PCP(Cr) (2.63 nm). The large difference was ascribed
to the coating of −NH2 groups on the pore surface.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Figure S2b) shows that PCP(Cr)-NH2 is a thermally robust material
up to 350 °C and is capable of Glc-to-HMF transformation within
200 °C.

2.2 Optimization of a Solvent System
To study the effect
of alkalinity on the Glc-to-HMF reaction, the
catalyst PCP(Cr)-NH2 was modified by methylation of amino
groups, and new catalysts PCP(Cr)-NHCH3 and PCP(Cr)-N(CH3)2 were obtained by adjusting the amount of the
methylation reagent. The catalysts in the order of alkalinity are
as follows: PCP(Cr)-N(CH3)2 > PCP(Cr)-NHCH3 > PCP(Cr)-NH2. PCP(Cr)-based catalysts were
used
under fixed reaction conditions (160 °C during 480 min). The
yields of HMF were in the following order: none (0%) < PCP(Cr)
(13.3%) < PCP(Cr)-N(CH3)2 (30.7%) < PCP(Cr)-NHCH3 (33.2%) < PCP(Cr)-NH2 (42.2%) (Table 2, entries 4–8). Compared
with PCP(Cr), the catalysts having base and acid functionalities could
facilitate the dehydration of Glc, indicating that introduction of
basic active sites is vital for the improvement of transformation
efficiency. Different from PCP(Cr)-N(CH3)2 and
PCP(Cr)-NHCH3, PCP(Cr)-NH2 gave the highest
efficiency. The interesting result demonstrates that the catalytic
activity of PCP(Cr)-based materials is also affected by the introduction
of methyl groups, which influence the steric hindrance and supramolecular
structure. Therefore, PCP(Cr)-NH2 is the selected catalyst.

a Reaction conditions:
100 mg of catalyst
(3 mol % calculated by active Cr), 200 mg of Glc, and 10 mL of water.
Entries 10–15: THF and NaCl were added.

The type of solvents immensely affects
the efficiency of Glc-to-HMF
conversion.25−27 The effects of various solvents [organic solvent
(DMSO or THF), H2O, and H2O/THF mixtures] on
production of HMF from Glc over the PCP(Cr)-NH2 catalyst
were investigated, keeping the temperature constant at 180 °C
for 8 h. The results are shown in Table 2.

DMSO28−30 and THF31 were recognized
as good organic solvents for the high-yield synthesis of HMF via dehydration
of Glc. However, the yield of HMF in DMSO is 9.0% starting from Glc
as the raw material (Table 2, entry 1). In THF (Table 2, entry 2), only 4.5% of HMF was detected when PCP(Cr)-NH2 was used as the catalyst. Although PCP(Cr)-based heterogeneous
catalysts could convert Glc to HMF in an organic solvent, the corresponding
yield was very low.

Water, as the most environmentally friendly
solvent, was chosen
for the transformation of Glc to HMF over the PCP(Cr)-NH2 catalyst. In the pure water system, at the temperatures below 160
°C, the HMF yield followed the increase in temperature (entries
3 and 6); up to 160 °C, the conversion rate of Glc is 78.4%,
and the maximum yield (42.2%) of HMF is achieved; above 160 °C,
the yield of HMF decreased (entries 9 and 10). Compared to organic
solvents, a higher HMF yield of 36.6%, with over 99.9% conversion
of Glc, is obtained in water (entry 9), showing that the PCP(Cr)-NH2 catalyst is significantly more active in water than in organic
solvents.

However, pure water does not usually give high HMF
selectivity,
due to the generation of levulinic acid (LA) and formic acid (FA),
as well as humin byproducts.32−34 According to the literature,4,32 Glc-to-HMF transformation in the H2O–NaCl/THF
biphasic solvent system proved to be an effective strategy for overcoming
the HMF degradation in water. In this system, the THF layer behaves
as an extracting phase for HMF, preventing its degradation and maximizing
the overall HMF yield.35 Moreover, the
nature of THF as a solvent is very important in controlling the distribution
of Glc dehydration products.32 The presence
of NaCl in the mixed solvent is essential for Glc conversion, as it
provides better phase separation of aqueous and THF phases.36 As shown in Scheme S1, HMF formed is instantly extracted from the aqueous into the THF
layer, preventing it from undergoing other side reactions. In this
way, the efficiency of Glc-to-HMF conversion is significantly improved.
HMF yields in the water/THF mixed reaction system are higher than
the yields in any solvent when used as a single phase.

To optimize
water-to-THF ratio that gives the highest HMF yield,
the catalytic reaction was performed in 1:1 to 1:4 water/THF range.
The HMF yield increased when THF volume was doubled (from 1:1 to 1:2
ratio). Up to 1:2 ratio, the conversion rate of Glc was 99.9%, and
the maximum yield (65.9%) of HMF was achieved. Going above this ratio,
the yield of HMF somewhat decreased, showing that the excessive amount
of THF reduces the performance of the catalyst. The highest HMF yield
achieved is 65.9% when the ratio of water to HMF is 1:2 (entry 13).
Therefore, the optimized water-to-THF ratio for this reaction is 1:2.

2.3 Product Analysis Upon the Conversion of Glc
Glc can participate in many chemical reactions, i.e., isomerization,
dehydration, and catalytical degradation in water (Scheme S2).32,37 In one known pathway, Glc is
initially isomerized to Fru, followed by the loss of three H2O molecules from one molecule of Fru and HMF formation. Subsequently,
the rehydration of HMF produces levulinic acid (LA) and formic acid
(FA).38 Unavoidably, the humins, which
are carbonaceous, heterogeneous, and polydisperse materials, are simultaneously
produced by the reactions between HMF and intermediates produced in
the dehydration of carbohydrates.39 The
results of quantification of Glc, Fru, furfural, LA, and FA are shown
in Table 3. Furfural,
LA, and FA were identified as the major byproducts in water.40,41 However, in the H2O-heterogeneous catalyst system, the
yields of LA (2.3%) and FA (4.1%) were extremely low, whereas furfural
was not observed, indicating that the PCP(Cr)-NH2 catalyst
has high chemoselectivity. Furthermore, a negligible amount of suspended
polymeric humins was found in the aqueous phase during the course
of reaction.

2.4 Catalyst Recycling
To evaluate the
reusability of PCP(Cr)-NH2, the repeated tests for this
catalyst in the water/THF reaction system were performed. After five
runs of PCP(Cr)-NH2, the yield of HMF remained high, within
the range of 65.9–65.2% (Figure S3). After the reaction, leaching of active chromium species in the
reaction solvent was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic
emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), and the negligible amount of elemental
chromium (<1 ppm, 0.004 wt %) was found. The results obtained prove
the robustness of PCP(Cr)-NH2 and open the possibility
for effective separation and reuse of this catalyst.

2.5 Catalytic Mechanism
The plausible
mechanism for the one-pot synthesis of HMF from Glc catalyzed by Lewis
acid–base PCP(Cr)-based polymers is shown in Scheme 1. A successful Glc-to-HMF conversion
requires two steps: the Glc–Fru isomerization and subsequent
loss of three water molecules of Fru to form HMF.

Scheme 1 Possible Mechanism
for Glc Dehydration to HMF Catalyzed by Bifunctional
PCP(Cr)-Based Catalysts
During the Glc-to-Fru isomerization, the nitrogen atoms
of the
amino groups grafted on PCP(Cr)-based catalysts act as catalytic Lewis
base active sites, and such polymers show excellent stability and
reusability. FTIR was used to investigate the mechanism of Glc-to-Fru
isomerization reaction in water catalyzed by the PCP(Cr)-based material.
The fractions of catalysts from the reaction mixture were analyzed
by FTIR spectroscopy. Due to the presence of Glc on the Lewis acid
active sites, the PCP(Cr) catalyst shows a spectrum different from
that of the unused PCP(Cr), as indicated in Figure S4a. The peak at ∼1382 cm–1 was shifted
to 1410 cm–1, probably due to interaction between
the noncoordinated metal clusters and Glc. The intensity of characteristic
bands at ∼1624 cm–1 increases, and this peak
might originate from the vibration of the furanose ring of Fru. Similar
to PCP(Cr), the use of MIL-101 as a catalyst for Glc isomerization
leads to high Glc conversion (78%) with low selectivity (12.6% Fru
yield) and formation of little HMF.39 These
results indicate that PCP(Cr) can be directly used as a Lewis acid
catalyst for Glc isomerization with low-level efficiency. Compared
with that of the catalyst having only Lewis acid functional groups,
the catalytic effect of amino groups in the PCP(Cr)-NH2 catalyst on Glc isomerization is more effective. The intensive absorption
peak of pure PCP(Cr)-NH2 at ∼1584 cm–1 was shifted to ∼1624 cm–1 upon the reaction
with Glc (Figure S4b). The newly observed
peak is a characteristic IR absorption peak of Fru, showing the usability
of PCP(Cr)-NH2 for Glc-to-Fru conversion under the mild
reaction conditions.

The conversion rate of Glc can increase
up to 99.9%, and the maximum
yield of HMF achieved is 65.9%. In aqueous solution, two forms of
Glc are at the equilibrium: open-chain and ring (pyranose) forms.
In their natural state, however, more than 99% of Glc molecules exist
as pyranose forms, where an aldehyde group is in the hemiacetal form.
We hypothesize that Glc first undergoes the ring-opening reaction
and forms aldose with the free aldehyde group. In the presence of
the PCP(Cr)-NH2 catalyst, the open-chain form of Glc proceeds
predominantly via proton transfer mechanism to form the straight-chain
Fru, and afterward, Fru undergoes the ring-closure reaction. The proton
transfer mechanism is illustrated in Scheme 2: PCP(Cr)-NH2 facilitates Glc-to-Fru
isomerization via the enediol intermediate formed upon proton transfer
from C-2 atom to the catalyst’s N atom as a Lewis base.8,42

Scheme 2 Synthetic Pathways for (1) PCP(Cr), (2) PCP(Cr)-NH2, (3)
PCP(Cr)-NHCH3, and (4) PCP(Cr)-N(CH3)2
The acidic active sites of
a catalyst are very important for dehydration
of Fru to HMF. Unsaturated metal clusters in PCP materials are hydrated
and form complex ions with H2O molecules as ligands. Such
complex cations are weak Lewis acids and may hydrolyze with the release
of H+ ions. The protons obtained subsequently catalyze
the Fru dehydration to HMF. The assistance of a Lewis base in the
conversion of Glc was visible when different bifunctional PCP(Cr)-based
catalysts were used under fixed reaction conditions (160 °C during
480 min). The enolization of Fru is a rate-determining step in Fru
dehydration.43 PCP(Cr)-NH2 could
activate Fru cooperatively at two positions: (1) C–OH of the
anomeric cation by the proton (electrophile) and (2) at the C–H
of Fru C1 atom via hydrogen bonding with N (nucleophile) (Scheme 2). It is reported
that a pure base, without any acidic functionalities, does not activate
Fru at the anomeric C–OH bond.44 To sum up, the co-existence of −NH2 groups as
hydrogen-bond donors and protons in PCP(Cr)-NH2 has led
to synergic effects and provided a highly selective and efficient
method for the transformation of Fru to HMF.

3 Conclusions
The bifunctional PCP(Cr)-based catalysts were
synthesized by the
one-pot hydrothermal reaction. The effective Lewis acid and Lewis
base synergetic catalytical properties were found in novel bifunctional
catalysts with the Cr cluster and unhindered −NH2 active sites. PCP(Cr)-NH2 was the optimal catalyst when
the water/THF optimized solvent system was used, which facilitated
the one-pot isomerization and dehydration of Glc, reaching 65.9% of
HMF yield and high Glc conversion (99.9%). The mechanistic study shows
that −NH2 groups enhance the Glc-to-Fru isomerization,
and the acidic active sites (Cr cluster) are essential in the dehydration
of Glc to HMF, which indicates that the new Brønsted acid-free
catalytic process for Glc transformation is feasible. The obtained
catalysts are recyclable for at least five runs with negligible leakage
of Cr ions, which opens a possibility for their application in the
chemical industry.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of PCP(Cr)-Based Catalysts
4.1.1 Synthesis
of PCP(Cr)
As shown in Scheme 2, PCP(Cr) [compound 1] was synthesized
by the coordination of isophthalic acid
with chromium(III), according to a previously reported hydrothermal
method.4 In a typical synthetic cycle,
10 mmol Cr(NO3)3·9H2O, 10 mmol
isophthalic acid, and 10 mmol hydrogen fluoride (HF) were dissolved
in 70 mL of H2O and heated at 220 °C for 24 h in a
Teflon-coated stainless steel autoclave. The solid product was isolated
from the mixture using a centrifuge and afterward washed with DMF.
The crude product was refluxed with ethanol (EtOH) for 5 h. After
cooling, the green product was separated from the liquid phase through
centrifugation, washed with H2O (5 × 30 mL), and dried
at 60 °C.

4.1.2 Preparation of PCP(Cr)-NH2
PCP(Cr)-NH2 [Scheme 2, compound 2] was synthesized
via the
new hydrothermal method by coordination of 5-aminoisophthalic acid
(5-AIPA) with chromium(III) ions. In a typical experiment, 10 mmol
Cr(NO3)3·9H2O, 10 mmol 5-AIPA,
and 10 mmol HF were dissolved in H2O (70 mL) and heated
at 220 °C for 8 h in a Teflon-coated stainless steel autoclave.
Due to the excellent solubility of 5-AIPA in H2O, the desired
PCP(Cr)-NH2 solid could be isolated from the reaction system
as a very pure substance using only centrifugation. After washing
with H2O (5 × 30 mL), the pure catalyst was obtained
and dried at 60 °C before storage or use.

4.1.3 Preparation of PCP(Cr)-NHCH3 and
PCP(Cr)-N(CH3)2
PCP(Cr)-NHCH3 [Scheme 2, compound 3] and PCP(Cr)-N(CH3)2 [Scheme 2, compound 4]
were prepared by methylation of amino groups on PCP(Cr)-NH2 with iodomethane (CH3I). For the preparation of PCP(Cr)-NHCH3, a mixture of 0.2 mmol PCP(Cr)-NH2, 0.22 mmol
iodomethane, and 0.8 mmol K2CO3 in 10 mL of
absolute ethanol was refluxed at 75 °C for 18 h. For the preparation
of PCP(Cr)-N(CH3)2, a previous procedure was
used with double amount of CH3I. The products were isolated
from the reaction system by centrifugation; purified by repeated washing
with CH2Cl2, EtOH and H2O; and dried
at 60 °C. The chemicals used were commercially available and
used without additional purification.

4.2 Catalyst
Characterization
The structural
and physicochemical characteristics of PCP-based catalysts were obtained
by SEM–EDX (Hitachi S-4800), TEM (JEM-2000EX), powder XRD (Bruker
D8 Advance), XPS (Thermo ESCALAB 250XI), N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms (TriStar 3000), FTIR spectroscopy (Thermo Nicolet 8700),
TGA (Rubotherm Dyn THERM), and temperature-programmed desorption (NH3/CO2-TPD; Auto Chem II 2920).

4.3 Typical Procedure for Catalytical Conversion
of Glc to HMF
4.3.1 Glc Transformation in
a Single Solvent
Glc or Fru dehydration was done in a Teflon-coated
stainless steel
autoclave. All reactants were added to the autoclave at room temperature.
In a typical experiment, 200 mg of Glc, 100 mg of a heterogeneous
catalyst, and 10 mL of a particular solvent were used. The mixture
was vigorously stirred and heated to 180 °C. After 480 min, the
reaction was stopped by cooling the vial to 0 °C using an ice
bath. The mixture was filtered to separate a solid catalyst, diluted
with water, and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC).

4.3.2 Glc Conversion in a Biphasic Solvent System
In a typical experiment, 200 mg of Glc, 100 mg of a heterogeneous
catalyst, 10 mL of water, 20 mL of THF, and 3.5 g of NaCl were loaded
into the autoclave. The reaction vessel was vigorously stirred while
being heated at 180 °C for 480 min. Upon completion, the reaction
was stopped using an ice bath at 0 °C. Both THF and aqueous layers
were passed through a 0.2 μm syringe filter and analyzed by
HPLC.4 Five cycles of experiments were
performed to explore the reusability of catalysts. After each run,
the catalyst was isolated by centrifugation and used in the next run
without any additional purification.

4.4 Analytical
Methods
HPLC (Waters 2489
equipped with Waters 1525 binary HPLC pump and UV detector at 284
nm) was utilized to analyze the yields of HMF and furfural. The column
was thermostated at 30 °C. The eluent CH3OH/H2O (0.2:0.8, v/v) was run at a flow rate of 0.8 mL min–1.

The carbohydrates (Glc, Fru, and furfural)
and organic acid content were analyzed using a liquid chromatography
system Agilent 1200 equipped with Aminex HPX-87H as a stationary phase
and a refractive index detector. The column was thermostated at 65
°C. The eluent (0.05 M H2SO4) was run at
0.55 mL min–1 flow rate. The amount of Cr3+ ions in a water solution collected after the reaction was quantified
by ICP-AES (IRIS Intrepid II XSP). HMF and side products were also
quantified using MS (Thermo Fisher ITQ-1100). The HMF yield from Glc
was calculated as
