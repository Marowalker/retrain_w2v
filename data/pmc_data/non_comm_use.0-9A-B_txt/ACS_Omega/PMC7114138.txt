Fulvic acid (FA)
has important properties and is used widely in
agriculture, industry, medicine, and other fields. However, there
is a lack of environmentally friendly and efficient extraction methods
for coal-based FA and its molecular structural characterization. In
this study, FA was extracted cleanly and efficiently from low-rank
lignite via the innovative method of microwave combined with hydrogen
peroxide and glacial acetic acid, followed by purification by the
sulfuric acid–acetone method. The molecular structures of FA
were precisely characterized by UV–vis spectroscopy, infrared
(IR) spectroscopy, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy, and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS).
The results showed that the microwave combined with hydrogen peroxide–glacial
acetic acid method had stronger oxidative degradation ability compared
with the conventional method. Under optimized conditions, the yield
of FA reached 60.97%. During the oxidation process, the macromolecular
network structure of coal was destroyed, resulting in the production
of many oxygen-containing functional groups. According to the IR and
UV–vis spectra, there were abundant oxygen-containing functional
groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, carbonyl, and quinone groups in
the molecular structure of FA. Determination of the total acid group
content in the oxygen-containing functional groups of FA showed that
the content of carboxyl groups was much higher than that of phenolic
hydroxyl groups. The 1H NMR showed that there were hydrogen
atoms present as part of carboxyl, aromatic, phenolic hydroxyl, and
aliphatic groups in FA. The (GC–MS) results suggested that
FA is a mixture of dozens of complex compounds, including alkanes,
alcohols, esters, etc.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Fulvic acid (FA) is a
component of humic acid (HA) with low aromaticity,
small molecules, many functional groups, and good water solubility.
It has the highest chemical, physiological, and physicochemical activities
of all the components of HA.1−4 FA has several desirable characteristics: it functions
as a platform compound, is easy to combine or react with other substances,
has micro- to nanometer size and good biocompatibility.1,4−7 Recent studies have shown that FA plays a special role in the prevention
and control of human and animal diseases,8−10 heavy metal
pollution control in water and soil,2,11,12 modern agriculture,3,4,13−16 and other fields. The potential biochemical activities
of FA have attracted the research interest of many scholars. Efficient
and environmentally friendly preparation of FA, and the identification
of its effective components, has become a research hotspot.

The representative FA was extracted from lignite, weathered coal,
and peat. The conventional extraction method coal-based FA mainly
involves alkali-dissolved acid precipitation and extraction by strong
acid. In recent years, the sulfuric acid–ethanol/acetone combination
method, ion-exchange resin extraction method, ultrasonic/microwave
method, and nonacid organic solvent extraction method5−7,17−22 have been developed. However, the existing extraction methods that
use large amounts of acid and alkali result in a certain amount of
corrosion and pollution of the operating environment and equipment;
more importantly, a large amount of acid and alkali remains in the
solid residue after FA extraction, which will cause extensive environmental
pollution. Additionally, most of the FA obtained by these methods
are mixtures of FA and FA salts, some of which even incorporate inorganic
salts, resulting in low yield of pure FA. As for the ion-exchange
resin method, its extraction speed is slow, selection of the appropriate
resin is challenging as many components of FA will dissolve and destroy
the resin, and the costs of maintenance and replacement of materials
are high. These factors limit its industrial application. The extraction
of FA by the organic solvent is a mild method but the yield of directly
extracted FA is low; some organic solvents are toxic or not significantly
different from the boiling point of FA components. In addition, how
to effectively separate the organic solvents from FA needs to be considered.

In this study, to solve the problems of pollution, low extraction
yield, and low purity of FA using traditional extraction methods,
low-rank lignite was oxidized by microwaves combined with hydrogen
peroxide and glacial acetic acid. This method was reported by Zhang,23 Miura,24 Deng,25 Rokhina,26 Zhang,27 and Gong.28,29 Hydrogen peroxide is
an environmentally friendly oxidant that reacts with glacial acetic
acid to produce the stronger oxidant peracetic acid, which destroys
the macromolecular reticular structure in coal and oxidizes the macromolecules
to oxygen-containing small molecules, thus increasing the yield of
FA. Microwaves can promote the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide
and peracetic acid to form free radicals and significantly accelerate
the reaction rate of oxidative degradation, thus shortening the reaction
time and increasing the FA extraction efficiency. The extracted FA
was purified by the sulfuric acid–acetone method and then characterized
using a set of analytical techniques, i.e., spectrometric methods, 1H NMR and GC–MS. The combination of these various techniques
provided a more robust characterization of FA.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Materials
Coal samples of low-rank
lignite were obtained from a deep mine in Inner Mongolia, China. The
milled lignite was sieved through an 80-mesh standard sieve (size
fraction less than 175 μm) and then dried at 105 °C for
24 h. The dried coal sample was immediately stored in a sealed bag
and stored at room temperature for later use.

Hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2), glacial acetic acid, acetone, and concentrated
sulfuric acid (H2SO4) were analytically pure
reagents.

2.2 Preparation of FA
Coal sample was
added to a spherical flask (250 mL). Glacial acetic acid and hydrogen
peroxide solution were mixed together and poured into the flask. Extraction
was carried out by magnetic agitation at a certain microwave power
in a microwave chemical reactor. A condensation tube was connected
to the flask to remove the heat released by the reaction. After the
reaction, the reaction mixture was filtered to afford a filtrate and
a residue. The filtrate was then concentrated by a rotary evaporator
and the concentrated filtrate was dried at 60 °C under vacuum
to obtain the primary product, FA.

The extraction was performed
by single-factor tests and orthogonal tests. The following five factors
were investigated for their effect on the extraction yield: microwave
power, reaction time, concentration of hydrogen peroxide solution,
ratio of glacial acetic acid to coal (acid–coal ratio), and
ratio of hydrogen peroxide solution to coal (oxygen–coal ratio).

2.3 Purification of FA
A certain amount
of concentrated sulfuric acid was added to the acetone–water
solution. This mixture was added to the primary FA in a single-mouth
flask, and the resulting mixture was magnetically stirred at 30 °C
for a certain duration. After purification, the supernatant was separated
from the mixture by centrifugation and the filtrate was concentrated
using a rotary evaporator. The concentrate was dried in an oven at
60 °C to afford the purified product, PFA.

2.4 Characterization
A series of analyses
and characterizations were performed to characterize the PFA.

A Kaiyuan 5E-CHN2000 elemental analyzer (Chang Sha Kai Yuan Instrument
Co., Ltd., China, Xuzhou) and a Tairui CTS7000 automatic sulfur meter
(Xuzhou Tairui Instruments and Equipment Co., Ltd., China, Xuzhou)
were used to determine the elemental composition of FA.

The
barium hydroxide–calcium acetate chemical titration
method was used to measure the total number of acidic and carboxyl
functional groups present. The phenolic hydroxyl group content was
determined by subtracting the carboxyl group content from the total
acid group content.

UV–vis spectra were obtained on a
Unico 2802 UV–vis
spectrophotometer (Unico (Shanghai) Electric Co., Ltd., China, Shanghai)
in the range of 200–800 nm.

FTIR spectra were recorded
for pellets prepared by pressing a mixture
of FA (1.5 mg) and dried spectrometry grade KBr (400 mg) using a Bruker
VERTEX 80 v spectrometer (Bruker, Germany). The spectra were recorded
in the range of 4000–400 cm–1.

1H NMR spectra of PFA was determined using a Bruker
AVANCE III HD 600 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (Bruker,
Germany).

PFA was divided into 10 fractions according to molecular
weight
and polarity. Activated silica gel was loaded into a chromatography
column by dry packing. PFA (2.00 g) was ground with silica gel (1:1
w/w) and added to the chromatography column. Ten different polar eluents
were used to elute FA; from lowest to greatest polarity, the eluents
were petroleum ether and petroleum ether/ethyl acetate mixtures with
different volume ratios (3:1, 1:1, or 1:3), ethyl acetate, chloroform,
chloroform/methanol mixtures with different volume ratios (3:1, 1:1,
or 1:3), and methanol. After gradient elution, 10 fractions were obtained
and recorded as A–J.

The fractions A–J were analyzed
by GC–MS using a
Jeol JMS-Q1000GC gas chromatography/mass spectrometer (Jeol, Japan)
equipped with a DB-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm ×
0.25 μm) and a quadrupole analyzer and operated in electron
impact (70 eV) mode. The initial temperature of the column was 60
°C, which was held for 2 min, then the column was heated to 240
°C at a rate of 3 °C·min–1, and maintained
at 240 °C for 5 min. The identification of peaks was based on
their retention time, mass spectra (comparison with standards), and
literature data.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Orthogonal Test Results and Analysis
The experimental
results and range of experimental conditions are
shown in Table 1. It
can be seen that the order of the effect of these five factors on
the extraction yield of FA, from greatest effect to least effect,
was reaction time, acid/coal ratio, oxygen/coal ratio, concentration
of hydrogen peroxide solution, and microwave power. Microwave power
and concentration of hydrogen peroxide solution had little effect
on the extraction yield of FA. The reaction time, acid/coal ratio,
and oxygen/coal ratio had a significant effect on the extraction yield
of FA. The optimal process conditions for the microwave-assisted hydrogen
peroxide–glacial acetic acid method were as follows: reaction
time of 13 min, microwave power of 700 W, acid/coal ratio of 1.32,
hydrogen peroxide concentration of 22.5%, and oxygen/coal ratio of
9. Under optimized conditions, the average extraction yield of FA
was 60.97% and its purity was 99.6%.

The results showed that microwaves could shorten the
reaction time
and increase the reaction rate.17,23 This was due to the
microwaves promoting the production of free radicals and decreasing
the activation energy. In contrast to a previous study,23 glacial acetic acid was added to the hydrogen
peroxide in this study, which greatly improved the yield of FA. The
reaction mechanism was as follows: hydrogen peroxide and glacial acetic
acid reacted to form peracetic acid, which is a stronger oxidant than
hydrogen peroxide and can decompose into a variety of free radicals
such as hydroxyl radicals, acetyl oxygen radicals, methyl radicals,
and peroxy radicals; these radicals reacted with large molecules in
coal to promote coal macromolecular chain cutting and formation of
small molecular components, greatly increasing the extraction yield
of FA.24−26

3.2 Elemental Analysis and
Functional Group Content
Analysis
Elemental content and oxygen-containing functional
group content of PFA are shown in Table 2. It can be seen that the content of total
acid groups and carboxyl groups in the FA product was relatively high,
indicating that the use of microwaves and glacial acetic acid could
promote the oxidative decomposition of coal to produce FA.

3.3 Infrared Spectral Analysis
The infrared
spectrum of FA is shown in Figure 1. The broad band from 3650 to 3200 cm–1 was attributed to hydroxyl stretching from various groups. The strong
and broad absorption peak at 3423 cm–1 was attributed
to the stretching vibrations of the hydrogen-bonded O–H groups.6,17−19 The absorbance at 3000–2700 cm–1 belonged to the C–H stretching vibrations of aliphatic hydrocarbons,
and the characteristic peaks of the sample in this region were not
obvious; this indicated that under experimental conditions, some of
the weak covalent bonds in the lignite structure were oxidized, resulting
in molecular fragmentation and the formation of oxygen-containing
functional groups such as phenolic hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups
and a decrease in the content of fatty structures such as methyl and
methylene groups. The double-bond stretching vibration was located
at 1900–1500 cm–1. The peak at 1719 cm–1 was strong and sharp and was attributed to the stretching
vibration of the saturated fatty acid C=O groups, including
carbonyl groups in carboxyl, aldehyde, and keto groups. There was
a C=C stretching vibration near 1646 cm–1. The 1500–1350 cm–1 region absorbances
were attributed to deformation vibrations of methyl and methylene
groups in alkyl structures. The peak at 1172 cm–1 corresponded to the C–O–C stretching vibrations. Peaks
from 950 to 650 cm–1 corresponded to the aromatic
absorption band;30,31 peaks in this region included
the out-of-plane bending vibrations of the C–H bonds on substituted
aromatic rings, and, more specifically, peaks from 900 to 750 cm–1 corresponded to the tri-substituted benzene ring,
and the peak at 806 cm–1 was assigned to tri-substituted
benzene ring vibrations, which had the largest relative content compared
to di- or tetra-substituted benzene rings.

Figure 1 FTIR spectrum of FA.

3.4 UV–vis Spectroscopic
Analysis
The UV–vis spectrum of FA is shown in Figure 2. There was a strong
absorption in the UV–vis
range, indicating that there was a large number of chromophores in
FA.23,27 The absorbance decreased with increasing
wavelength. As the molecular structure of FA is complex, chromophore
absorption occurs with varying degrees of overlap or displacement,
and the UV–vis absorption spectrum does not show obvious characteristic
absorption peaks. There was a broad absorption peak around 280 nm
arising from the absorption of aromatic structures. Absorption peaks
at 260 nm were due to conjugated double bonds, which may include groups
such as aldehydes and quinones.30

Figure 2 UV–vis
spectrum of FA.

3.5 1H NMR of FA
Figure 3 shows the 1H NMR spectrum of PFA. The chemical
shift of the DMSO solvent is
at about 2.51 ppm and that of water peak is near 3.36 ppm. Because
the sample and solvent readily absorb water, the water peak was stronger.
The protons of FA were mainly distributed from 0 to 13.5 ppm. There
was a strong peak at 1.25 ppm that was attributed to terminal aliphatic
methyl protons. The peak at 2.45 ppm corresponded to the α-position-connected
polar functional groups such as aromatic rings and carbonyl groups
in aliphatic groups. The peaks in the range of 3.3–4.5 ppm
arose from protons linked to heteroatoms such as O, N, and S; this
was probably because glacial acetic acid reacts with hydrogen peroxide
to produce peracetic acid, the stronger oxidizing ability of which
leads to the oxidation of some of the aliphatic protons to oxygen-containing
functional groups. The chemical shifts of protons on phenolic hydroxyl
groups were in the range of 4.5–6.5 ppm. Chemical shifts of
protons on aromatic or heteroaromatic rings were between 6.5 and 9.0
ppm. The presence of a broad carboxyl proton peak from 12 to 13.5
ppm may be due to the strong oxidizing ability of hydrogen peroxide
and glacial acetic acid under microwave irradiation, causing the oxidation
of side chains linked by benzene rings to carboxyl groups.

3.6 Column
Chromatography and GC–MS
Purified FA was divided into
10 fractions according to their polarities.
The yields are shown in Table 3.

Table 3 Yields of Different Fractions of FA
Separated by Column Chromatography
fraction	yield (%)	fraction	yield (%)	
A	0.41	F	2.32

C	2.07	H	30.29	
D	5.05	I	10.15	
E	5.52	J	0.86	
All of the extracts
(A–J) from purified FA were analyzed
by GC–MS, but no compounds were detected in C–J. This
was probably because the molecular weights of eight components exceeded
600. Compounds were detected in A and B. Figure 4 shows the total ion chromatogram (TIC) of
A from PFA. More than 20 compounds were detected in total, with 11
alkane compounds (peaks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 13, 16, 17, 18, and 21),
four alcohol compounds (peaks 7, 9, 12, and 20), two hydrazide compounds
(peaks 5 and 11), one olefinic aldehyde (peak 3), and three unknown
compounds. All compounds are listed in Table 4.

Figure 5 shows that
18 different compounds were identified in B by GC–MS analysis.
Esters were the most common type of compound detected in B. Ten esters
(peaks 1–4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 17, and 18) were detected. There
were four alkane compounds (peaks 7, 11, 13, and 14), and two sulfur-containing
compounds were also detected, namely, dibenzothiophene sulfone (peak
8) and dibenzyl sulfone (peak 10). All compounds are listed in Table 5.

4 Conclusions
FA was extracted efficiently
from lignite by microwave-assisted
hydrogen peroxide in combination with glacial acetic acid. The optimal
conditions were as follows: reaction time of 13 min, microwave power
of 700 W, acid/coal ratio of 1.32, hydrogen peroxide concentration
of 22.5%, and oxygen/coal ratio of 9. Under optimized conditions,
the average extraction yield of FA was 60.97%. This method uses low-environmental
impact reagents with short reaction time and low energy consumption,
and the yield was increased compared to other existing methods. Therefore,
this approach provides a new theoretical and technical reference for
the extraction of coal-based FA.

Spectral analysis, including
UV–vis, infrared, 1H NMR, and GC–MS, showed
that under strong oxidative conditions
of peracetic acid produced by hydrogen peroxide reacting with glacial
acetic acid, the large molecular structure of coal was destroyed and
small molecules of FA were formed, which were rich in carboxyl, hydroxyl,
carbonyl, and other oxygen-containing functional groups, including
dozens of small molecular organic compounds such as alkanes, alcohols,
aldehydes, esters, etc. These results provide a scientific explanation
for the multiple active functions of FA across many applications and
also lay the foundation for further research on the structure of FA.
