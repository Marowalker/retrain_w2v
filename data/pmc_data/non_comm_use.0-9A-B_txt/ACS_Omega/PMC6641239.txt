Hydrogen chloride
(HCl) gas is a hazardous byproduct of industrial
processes. Colorimetric approaches to facilitate portable and remote
detection are especially desirable. We graft polyaniline to the surface
of electrospun nylon nanofibers to minimize mass transfer. Using the
resulting nanofibers, we demonstrate colorimetric detection of HCl
at sub-ppm levels. We investigated the reusability of the fibers and
observed a twofold increase in the limit of detection with multiple
uses because of dedoping of the PANi indicated by elemental analysis.
The limit of detection using visual detection was compared to spectrophotometric
analysis. The ΔE from CIE LAB color space analysis
via diffuse reflectance spectroscopy enhances the limit of detection
by ∼fivefold when compared to visual detection. This analysis
is a promising approach for remote detection using simple commercial
digital cameras to achieve low limits of detection.

==== Body
Introduction
Hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas is a common
byproduct of industrial
processes. Because it is hazardous, HCl is strictly regulated. An
exposure to 5 ppm is considered a workplace hazard. Therefore, portable
and remote detection of HCl at the ppm level is necessary. Colorimetric
detection that does not require instrumentation is especially desirable.1−6

Optochemical detection of HCl has been reported using thin
films
of meso-tetra(4-pyridyl)porphyrin, which undergoes a color change
upon protonation. Monitoring the change in UV absorbance at 470 nm,
the detection limit was 0.01 ppm HCl.4 Similar
porphyrins have been incorporated into hydrophobic membranes for sensing.
The response rate of the sensor was observed to be diffusion-controlled.7

Electrospun nanofibers are considered promising
for improving sensing
performance because of their high surface area-to-volume ratio. Porphyrinated
polyimide (porphyrins incorporated into the polymer backbone)5 or blends of styrene–ethylene–butylene–styrene
triblock copolymer with pH-sensitive, pyridine-based dyes3 has been electrospun for fluorescence-based HCl
detection. Improved sensitivity was observed when comparing electrospun
nanofibers and drop-cast polymer membranes.

To avoid the need
for instrumentation, colorimetric HCl detection
using polymer nanofibers has also been considered using polydiacetylenes,
a pH-responsive, conjugated polymer that transitions from blue to
red upon exposure to HCl because of the formation of quaternary ammonium
salts. Visible detection of 2 ppm was reported. However, the nanofibers
were not stable upon exposure to HCl, so reuse was not possible.1

Using nylon–polyaniline blend nanofibers,
ppb-level detection
of HCl was achieved using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The
limit of detection was significantly lower than polyvinyl alcohol–polyaniline
films (∼10 ppm). Frequency shift response curves as a function
of time were comparable for three cycles.2 When using a QCM for detection, a color change from blue to green
was observed upon exposure to HCl because of the protonation of the
polymer backbone.2,8 However, additional studies are
required to establish colorimetric HCl detection.

In this work,
we demonstrate colorimetric detection of HCl using
polyaniline grafted to electrospun nylon-6,6 nanofibers to minimize
diffusion limitations. We focus on evaluating the effect of reuse
on the limit of detection. We further compare the limit of detection
using visual detection to spectrophotometric analysis.

Results and Discussion
Nanofiber
Preparation
Nylon nanofibers were prepared
by electrospinning a solution of nylon in formic acid. In a typical
experiment, nylon 6,6 was dissolved in formic acid (20 wt %). Electrospinning
nylon–formic acid solutions resulted in 290 ± 80 nm nanofibers
(Figure 1A). Some netting,
that is, the presence of networks of thin nylon nanofibers, was observed.
This observation is consistent with recent work using formic acid
as a solvent. The formation of the “nanonets” was attributed
to phase separation of the polymer during solvent evaporation.9

nylon nanofibers,
(C) PANi-grafted to nylon nanofibers exposed to acid and reset with
ammonia, and (D) PANi-grafted to nylon reset 15 times with a 3 μm
scale bar.

Graft polymerization of polyaniline
is initiated from amine groups
on the nylon nanofiber. To increase the amine groups available for
grafting, the nylon nanofibers were partially hydrolyzed by HCl. Nanofibers
were cut into 0.5 in. diameter pieces, then placed in 2.5 M HCl at
ambient conditions for 1 h, and finally washed with deionized water
until the wash was neutral. Acid treatment of the nylon fibers cleaves
the amide groups exposing a carboxylic acid and amine functional group.10 Polyaniline was grafted to the nylon fibers
via chemical oxidative polymerization at 0 °C based on previous
reports.11 Briefly, the acid-treated fibers
were placed in aniline hydrochloride dissolved in HCl. Ammonium persulfate
was added dropwise with constant stirring. The reaction proceeded
on ice with constant stirring for 2.5 h. The PANi was converted to
the emeraldine base form by sonicating the sample in ammonium hydroxide.
Because the emeraldine base form is soluble in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP), the fabrics were washed with NMP to remove any PANi that was
not covalently attached to the surface.12,13

Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) confirms that the acid treatment
did not significantly affect the morphology of the fibers (Figure 1B). The fiber diameter
decreased slightly with the acid treatment to 190 ± 60 nm. Following
the acid treatment, PANi was grafted to the nylon nanofibers. Similar
to the acid treatment, the addition of PANi did not affect the nanofiber morphology
(Figure 1C). The fiber
diameter was comparable (170 ± 40 nm) after the graft polymerization.
Exposing the PANi-containing fibers to HCl and resetting with aqueous
ammonium hydroxide multiple times (at least 15 resets), the fiber
structure remains unaffected (Figure 1D). The size after multiple resets was comparable 200
± 30 nm.

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
Minimal changes
in Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were observed following
acid treatment, consistent with previous studies.14 Upon grafting, features of both nylon and PANi are present
and overlap. Analyzing a direct comparison of nylon with PANi to neat
nylon, differences in the spectra are attributed to the presence of
PANi (Figure 2). Specifically,
we examine changes in the relative peak intensities that increase
with increasing species (PANi) concentration as an indication of the
presence of PANi.15 To facilitate comparison,
spectra were baseline-corrected to the value at 1800 cm–1 and normalized to the peak at ∼1660 cm–1. We observed an increase in the ratio of amide II (C–N stretching)
to amide I (C=O stretching) to bands at ∼1540 and ∼1660
cm–1,16 respectively.
We attribute this difference to an overlap of the amide II group peak
of nylon with benzenoid ring stretching of PANi at ∼1540 cm–1. Further, upon grafting, we observe new peaks at
∼820 and ∼1495 cm–1 that are not present
in the nylon spectra. The peak at ∼820 cm–1 has been attributed to the out-of-plane CH bending vibrations of
PANi, and the peak at ∼1495 cm–1 is associated
with the quinoid ring of PANi14 that is
not present in nylon. Overall, the changes in the spectra upon grafting
indicate a successful modification of the nylon fibers with PANi.

and ∼1495 cm–1 are observed because of the
presence of PANi.

Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy
Diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy confirms the polymerization of PANi in the emeraldine
salt form. The emeraldine salt form can be converted to the emeraldine
base form by exposing the sample to ammonium hydroxide. Upon exposure
to ammonium hydroxide, the PANi backbone is deprotonated. There is
a corresponding change in optical properties, that is, green to blue
(Figure 3A), as can
also be identified by the maximum in % reflectance shifts from ∼540
to ∼475 nm (Figure 3B). The changes in the spectra as a function of pH are comparable
to previous reports.17,18 Because this change is reversible
and can be repeated for multiple cycles, it is the basis for the colorimetric
detection of HCl vapor.

form (blue, bottom) and emeraldine salt form (green, top). (B) Analysis

Colorimetric Detection
of HCl Vapor
Proof of Concept
For visual detection
of HCl, the PANi-containing
fibers were suspended above HCl solutions in a sealed container. Half
of the sample was covered, and half of the sample was exposed to the
acid (Figure 3A). The
sample was observed after a set amount of time (arbitrarily set at
5 min) to determine if a visual color change occurred. Six fabrics
were tested. A color change was observed at ∼0.09 ppm HCl vapor
concentration. This result is comparable to previous studies using
polyaniline and QCM for detection.19

Reuse
For practical applications, reusability of the
sample is an important consideration. Following exposure to HCl, fibers
were reset to blue with 0.1 M ammonia, dried, and retested. When reset
to blue with ammonia, the concentration of HCl vapor that could be
detected visually within 5 min increased by ∼50% (Figure 4). With additional
resets, the concentration of HCl vapor that could be detected visually
within 5 min increased from 0.09 to 0.16 ppm. The concentration of
HCl vapor that could be detected visually after 15 resets was comparable
to 6 resets (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Minimum amount of HCl detected visually within 5 min initially
and after being reset multiple times. The minimum amount of HCl increases
after 2 and 6 resets but remains consistent from 6 to 15 resets (p < 0.05).

In contrast with our experiments, when PANi deposited on
a filter
paper was used for the colorimetric detection of ammonia, no change
in the limit of detection was noted for up to 50 cycles.8 To understand the observed decreased limit of
detection of HCl vapor, we further analyzed the initial samples and
the reset samples using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

We performed elemental analysis of the fibers after 15 resets for
comparison to the initial nanofibers (Table 1). Comparison using XPS indicates a decrease
in the chlorine content with multiple resets. This dedoping has been
observed previously20−22 and attributed to the diffusion of the small anion
dopants out of the PANi.20 In previous
reports, dedoping affects the PANi backbone oxidation state and reduces
the conductivity of PANi. The change in the oxidation state affects
the colorimetric detection, and as the dopant level decreases, the
amount of HCl required to induce a change in color increases. Given
that the dopant level is 0% after 15 resets, no further decrease in
the limit of detection is expected with further reuse. A consistent
response would be expected in a practical setting, provided an appropriate
pretreatment to dedope the fabrics.

Limit of Detection Comparison: Visual Detection Versus Spectrophotometric
Analysis
The sub-ppm limit of detection is promising, and
colorimetric detection offers an equipment-free method of analysis.
With visual detection, we expect there to be a trade-off between the
ease of use and limit of detection. Therefore, we compared the limit
of detection using visual determination with diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
after 15 resets. Using visual determination, a color change was observed
at a concentration of 0.2 ppm. Using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy,
we used two metrics to define the color change: (1) an increase in
the wavelength at which the maximum reflectance occurred of 20 nm
or (2) a ΔE of 5 in the CIE LAB color space23 from the diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurement.
The CIE L*A*B space
was defined by the International Commission on Illumination, abbreviated
CIE. It uses three axes to define color, lightness (L), A-axis to differentiate red and green, and B-axis to differentiate blue and yellow. The L*A*B space was selected because
it is strongly correlated with human visual perception.24 The limit of detection using the CIE L*A*B color space was
0.04 ppm, whereas the limit using the shift in the wavelength was
0.08. As expected, spectrophotometric analysis decreased the limit
of detection by ∼fivefold. Interestingly, the changes in the
CIE L*A*B color space were ∼twofold more sensitive
than monitoring changes in the reflectance spectra. The use of the
CIE L*A*B color space to define a color change can
be adapted to commercial cameras to facilitate remote monitoring as
a future direction.25

Overall, the
focus of this work was the visual detection of HCl using PANi-modified
polymer nanofibers. PANi is a useful platform for evaluating visual
detection and has been used for the detection of other compounds such
as NH3, H2S, etc.26 Because the mechanism of the color change is due to the protonation
of the PANi backbone,2,8 this approach is not specific
to HCl. Selective detection of HCl may be possible by doping PANi
with iron and aluminum6 and will be the
objective of future studies.

Conclusions
Overall,
we have demonstrated the use of PANi-grafted nylon nanofibers
for the colorimetric detection of HCl. Sub-ppm levels of HCl were
detected visually within 5 min. We investigated the reusability of
the fibers, and the limit of detection increased by ∼twofold
with multiple uses. We attribute this increase in the limit of detection
to dedoping of the PANi indicated by elemental analysis. After an
initial decrease in the dopant level, the limit of detection remains
consistent, which is important for practical applications. Complete
dedoping is observed after 15 resets, so no further decrease in the
limit of detection is expected with additional reuses. Finally, we
quantify the trade-off between the ease of use and limit of detection
by comparing visual detection to spectrophotometric analysis. The
limit of detection improved by ∼fivefold using the ΔE from the CIEL*A*B color space analysis.
This analytical approach is promising for remote detection using commercial
digital cameras to achieve low limits of detection with simple equipment.

Methods
Materials
Nylon-6 pellets (Ultramid B40 01, viscosity
average MW = 63 kDa) were obtained from BASF Corporation (Michigan,
USA). NMP and ammonium hydroxide were obtained from Fisher Scientific
(Wood Dale, IL, and Arlington, TX, respectively). Aniline hydrochloride,
ammonium persulfate, formic acid, and hydrochloric acid were obtained
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). All chemicals were used as received.

Electrospinning
Nylon nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning
a solution of nylon in formic acid. In a typical experiment, nylon
6,6 was dissolved in formic acid (20 wt %). The mixture was stirred
for 3–4 h at 60 °C and cooled at an ambient temperature
for 1 h without stirring to minimize air bubbles. The solution was
then electrospun onto aluminum foil using a point-plate configuration
composed of a precision syringe pump (New Era NE-300) and a high-voltage
power supply (Matsusada Precision Inc., model AU-40R0.75) with positive
polarity. Typical electrospinning parameters were a flow rate of 0.15
mL/h, tip-to-collector distance of 12 cm, 22-gauge blunt tip (0.508
mm i.d.), and an operating voltage of ∼20 kV.

Polyaniline
Graft Polymerization
To graft polymerize
polyaniline onto the surface of nylon fibers, the nylon was first
acid-treated for partial hydrolysis to expose additional functional
end groups. Nanofibers were cut into 0.5 in. diameter pieces, then
placed in 2.5 M HCl at ambient conditions for 1 h, and finally washed
with deionized water until the wash was neutral. The fibers were then
dried at ambient conditions.

Polyaniline was grafted to the
nylon fibers via chemical oxidative polymerization at 0 °C based
on previous reports.11 Briefly, the acid-treated
fibers were placed in 10 mL of 0.150 M aniline hydrochloride dissolved
in 1.2 M HCl and placed on ice. Ammonium persulfate (0.150 M in 1.2
M HCl) was cooled to 0 °C and 10 mL was added dropwise with constant
stirring. The reaction proceeded on ice with constant stirring for
2.5 h. The PANi–nylon samples were placed in 0.1 M ammonium
hydroxide and sonicated for 30 min to convert the PANi to the emeraldine
base form. Because the emeraldine base form is soluble in NMP, the
fabrics were placed in NMP and sonicated for 30 min to remove PANi
not covalently attached to the surface.12,13 The NMP washes
were continued until the solvent remained colorless after sonication.
Finally, the fabrics were rinsed with deionized water and dried at
ambient conditions before further use.

Sample Characterization
The samples were sputter-coated
with gold, and the fiber morphology was examined with SEM using Hitachi
SU-70 FE-SEM (accelerating voltage of 2 kV). The average fiber size
and standard deviation were determined by measuring the diameter of
100 fibers using ImageJ software developed by US NIH. Nylon nanofibers
and PANi-grafted samples were analyzed by attenuated total reflection
(ATR) infrared spectroscopy (Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS10). Spectra
were recorded from 400 to 4000 cm–1 averaging 64
scans. Diffuse reflectance spectra (350–1200 nm) of the samples
were obtained with an Ocean Optics Flame spectrometer (FLAME-S-VIS-NIR-ES)
equipped a tungsten–halogen light source (HL-2000-HP-FHSA,
20 W output) with a diffuse reflectance probe (RPH-1) at room temperature
using poly(tetrafluoroethylene) as a standard.27 Elemental analysis was performed using a ThermoFisher ESCALAB
250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromated aluminum
X-ray source, survey and high-resolution spectra were recorded by
1 and 0.1 eV steps, respectively similar to previous reports.28 Data were fit and analyzed using CasaXPS 2.3.16
V and NIST standard reference database 20, version 4.1. The dopant
concentration was determined from the high-resolution spectra measuring
three locations per sample.

Colorimetric Detection of HCl
Colorimetric
responses
to HCl vapor were carried out by visual inspection. In a sealed container,
nanofibers with PANi were suspended over aqueous HCl solutions of
increasing concentration until a visual color change was observed
within 5 min. The HCl in the vapor phase was calculated from tabulated
data.29 Afterward, the fabric was reset
by submersion in an ammonium hydroxide solution (5 mL, 0.1 M) for
1 min, dried at ambient conditions, and the colorimetric response
was remeasured. To examine reusability, the colorimetric responses
for up to 15 resets were measured for at least 6 samples.
