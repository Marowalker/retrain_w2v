The adsorption of quinoline from wastewater by coking
coal (AC-1),
HCl-modified coking coal (AC-2), HNO3-modified coking coal
(AC-3), HF-modified coking coal (AC-4), and H2SO4-modified coking coals (AC-5) was investigated in this paper. The
effects of acid-modified concentration, modification time, and adsorption
time versus quinoline removal rate were studied by batch experiments.
The quinoline concentration was measured by UV spectrophotometry,
the average pore size and specific surface area of coking coal before
and after modification were characterized through static nitrogen
adsorption, the mineral composition of coking coal was tested by X-ray
diffraction, the surface functional groups were tested by Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy, and the surface topography was tested
using a scanning electron microscope. The experimental results showed
that the adsorption capacity of coking coals was the best when both
the modification time was 120 min and the acid-modified concentration
was 0.1 mol·L–1 and the quinoline removal rate
reaches the highest when the adsorption time was 120 min. The specific
surface area of AC-2 increased from 2.898 to 3.637 m2·g–1, and the removal rate of quinoline increased from
77.64 to 90.61%. Acids reacted with inorganic mineral impurities within
coking coal such as hydrogen vanadium phosphate hydrate, which caused
an increase in the specific surface area. A new peak appeared in the
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy pattern at the wavenumber
2300 cm–1. The surface of coking coal modified by
acids was rougher than that of AC-1. The adsorption capacity of coking
coal was improved after modification, and modified coking coals have
the highest potential as low-cost adsorbents for quinoline removal.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Quinoline is one of the
higher-molecular-weight (MW) organics with
a strong stench in industrial wastewater, and it is harmful to both
nature and human life because it is highly toxic.1,2 Exposure
to quinoline vapors for a short period of time can cause irritation
of the nose, eyes, and respiratory tract and can also cause dizziness
and nausea.3,4

There are several methods used for
quinoline disposal, which mainly
include chemical,5 biological,6 and adsorption methods.7,8 However,
some of these methods have high operational and maintenance costs.9 For example, the chemical method will produce
secondary pollution and generate a large amount of sludge, and the
removal efficiency of the biological method is low.10 Compared with chemical and biological methods, adsorption
is a traditional method, which can remove quinoline effectively. The
advantage of the adsorption method is that it is easy to operate,
but its disadvantage is that adsorption is a process of physical change
and pollutants are not decomposed and eliminated during the disposal
process.11

Among the different adsorbents
available, coking coal is one of
the most effective adsorbents.12 However,
the adsorption capacity of raw coking coal is low; it has been previewed
by researchers that the adsorption capacity of raw coking coal can
be enhanced by surface modification. In this paper, the raw coking
coal was processed with HCl, HNO3, H2SO4, and HF acids to modify the surface properties, and batch
adsorption experiments were conducted to evaluate the feasibility
of quinoline removal under varying conditions. The advantage of using
coking coal for quinoline disposal is that after adsorption, coking
coal can be returned to produce industrial coke, burn, or prepare
a coal−water slurry, where the value of coking coal was not
reduced.13,14 The experimental purpose of this paper is
to investigate the effect of different acid-modified coking coals
on the adsorption of quinoline, and the surface property changes of
raw and modified coking coals were studied also.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effect of Modification Times on Specific Surface
Area and Pore Size Distribution
The specific surface area
and adsorption average pore size of coking coal were measured, and
the acid-modified concentration is 0.1 mol·L–1. The results are shown in Figures 1 and 2, the specific surface
area of AC-1 is 2.898 m2·g–1, and
the average pore size of AC-1 is 12.212 nm.

Figure 1 Plot of coking coal specific
surface area vs modification time.

Figure 2 Plot of average pore size vs modification time.

With the increase in the modification time, the
specific surface
area of coking coal increases first, then decreases, and reaches the
maximum at 120 min. The sequence of specific surface areas is AC-2
(3.637 m2·g–1) > AC-3 (3.569
m2·g–1) > AC-4 (3.432 m2·g–1) > AC-5 (3.297 m2·g–1) > AC-1 (2.898 m2·g–1). The average
pore size of coking coal is decreased after HCl and H2SO4 modification. The pore volume was decreased due to the shrinking
pore size; at the same time, there are also new pore volumes generated
by a dissolution reaction, but the pore volume is generally reduced.
The specific surface area was increased due to the new pore channel;
at the same time, the specific surface area decreased caused by the
diameter reduction, and the specific surface area is generally increased.
In the modification process, the specific surface area is increased,
and the average pore size of AC-1 is decreased.10

2.2 Effects of Modification Concentration and
Time on Adsorption
The changes of the quinoline removal rate
under different modification conditions were carried out. The results
are shown in Figures 3 and 4.

Figure 3 Plot of quinoline removal rates vs acid
concentration of modification.

Figure 4 Plot of quinoline removal rates vs modification time.

As seen from Figure 3, in the coking coal modified with different acid amounts,
the quinoline
removal rate increased first and then decreased with the increase
in acid concentration, and the quinoline removal rate is the highest
when the acid concentration is 0.1 mol·L–1.
The change of the quinoline removal rate versus modification time
is consistent with Figure 3, and the quinoline removal rate is the highest when the modification
time is 120 min. With the increase in acid concentration and modification
time, the dissolution reaction was more intense. At the same time,
the specific surface area of coking coal samples after four different
acid modifications is lower than that of raw coking coal. The larger
the specific surface area, the more surface sites are available. At
the optimum condition, the removal rates of quinoline by AC-1, AC-2,
AC-3, AC-4, and AC-5 are 70.44, 90.61, 87.68, 87.28, and 90.61%, respectively.15,16

2.3 Adsorption Kinetics of Coking Coal
The adsorption kinetics of coking coal samples was investigated.
The result is shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Plot of quinoline removal rates and adsorption capacities vs adsorption
time.

As can be seen from Figure 5, the original and modified samples showed
very similar kinetic
behavior for quinoline adsorption where removal and adsorption capacity
curves were single, smooth, and continuously leading to saturation.
At the initial stage of the reaction, quinoline removal rates increase
obviously and exceed 90% when the adsorption time reaches 200 min.
When the adsorption time exceeds 120 min, the increase in quinoline
removal rates tends to become smooth, and the adsorption process reaches
equilibrium at 870 min. Xu et al.17 found
that the equilibrium time needed for organic constituents from the
reverse osmosis concentrate in the coal chemical industry adsorption
on coking coal was almost 540 min. At the adsorption time of 120 min,
the quinoline removal rates are 77.64% for AC-1, 90.61% for AC-2,
87.68% for AC-3, 87.28% for AC-4, and 90.61% for AC-5. The results
show that the adsorption capacity of coking coal after modification
is higher than that of raw coking coal and the removal rate of quinoline
increased from 70.44 to 90.61%. The main reason is that the specific
surface areas increase after being modified, which proves to be an
effective way to enhance the adsorption capacities of coking coal.
The adsorption process of coking coal follows a quasi-second-order
kinetic equation well, and this conclusion can be found in another
paper by Xu et al.18

2.4 Adsorption Isotherm of Coking Coal
The adsorption isotherm is used to investigate the movement state
of adsorbates on the surface properties of adsorbents and the interaction
between the adsorbate and adsorbent. When the adsorption process reaches
equilibrium, the adsorption capacity for gas or vapor is proportional
to the mass of the adsorbent. The equilibrium adsorption capacities
depend on the adsorption temperature T, the gas or
vapor pressure P, and the properties of the adsorbent
and adsorbate gas.

The adsorption isotherm of coking coal was
tested at an acid concentration of 0.1 mol·L–1, modification time of 120 min, and temperature of 77 K. The results
are listed in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Isotherm adsorption curve of raw and modified coking coals.

Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were determined on
the samples both
before and after modification treatments shown in Figure 6, the isothermal adsorption
curve of raw and modified coking coals is close to the adsorption
isotherm type II. The front section of the adsorption curve rises
slowly with a slightly downward concave; the rear section rises sharply
and continues to rise until the relative pressure is close to 1.0.
The result indicates that the capillary agglomeration occurred during
the adsorption of nitrogen. In the low-pressure section (P/P0 = 0.0–0.3), the first half
of the curve rises slowly and has a downward dimple shape; this stage
is the transition from the adsorption monolayer to the multimolecular
layer. In the middle-pressure section (P/P0 = 0.3–0.8), the adsorption capacities
increase steadily with increasing pressure, and this stage is the
multimolecular layer adsorption process. In the second half of the
curve (P/P0 = 0.8–1.0),
the adsorption line rises sharply. Ge et al.19 found that some mesopores lead to a gradual increase in adsorption
after the initial filling of the micropores followed by a more rapid
increase near saturation. The saturated adsorption amount of N2 increased after microwave modification, which implied an
increase in the pore volume. It does not show adsorption saturation
until it approaches the saturated vapor pressure. Because of capillary
condensation, the large pores over volume filling, so the sample contains
a certain amount of mesopore and macropore.20,21

2.5 Effects of Different Modification Conditions
on the Surface Morphology of Coking Coal
The changes in mineral
composition, specific surface area, and pore structure can be more
intuitively determined from the surface morphology of raw and modified
coking coals. Scanning electron microscope images of coking coal samples
under different modification conditions were obtained using a scanning
electron microscope, which is shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Scanning electron microscope images of coking
coals modified in
different conditions.

As can be seen from Figure 7, there is little difference in the surface
morphology of
the samples except for that the surface of coking coal gradually becomes
rougher after modified with four different acids. As the specific
surface areas of AC-X (X = 2–5)
become bigger than AC-1, there may be some pore widening on the modified
coking coal, which could have occurred due to the modification process.
Moreover, Huang et al. reported that the surface of lignite raw coal
is relatively flatter, and it gradually becomes rough after treatment
with nitric acid; the higher the modification concentration of nitric
acid, the more apparent the charge is, which fully demonstrated the
corrosive effect of nitric acid on the lignite structure.22

2.6 Infrared Spectroscopy Analysis of Raw and
Modified Coking Coals
The spectral characteristics of AC-X (X = 1–5) are studied, the acid
concentration is 0.1 mol·L–1, and the modification
time is 120 min. The results are shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8 FTIR spectra of raw and modified coking coals.

As seen from Figure 8, the intensity of the absorption peak for modified
coking coal increases
at a wavenumber of 3500 cm–1 where −OH is
oxidized during the modification process. For the stretching vibration
and shear vibration of methyl and methylene groups, the absorption
peak intensity increases at 2900 cm–1, which are
difficult to be oxidized during the modification process, so the change
is not obvious. A new peak appears in the Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy pattern at the wavenumber 2300 cm–1 and moves to a high-frequency direction. The molecule vibration
can be considered belong to three-button or cumulative double-button
stretching vibration at the wavenumber 2000–2500 cm–1..23 The peak at 1600 cm–1 belongs to the in-plane stretching vibration of aromatic hydrocarbons
and carboxylic acid. During the whole modification process, the shape
and strength of the peaks of unsaturated hydrocarbon bonds in aromatic
hydrocarbons are basically unchanged, which indicates that aromatic
hydrocarbons are difficult to be oxidized during the modification
process. The peak at 1000 cm–1 is attributed to
minerals; the peak intensity and peak shape are basically unchanged
during the modification process.24

Through experimental analysis and data collation, the main absorption
peaks of coking coal samples and their attributed vibrations are studied;
the result is listed in Table 1.

2.7 Mineral Composition
The crystallization
characteristics of raw and modified coking coals are studied by X-ray
diffraction. The result is shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 XRD spectra of raw and modified coking coals.

Coal is mainly composed of two major components:
kaolinite and
hydrogen vanadium phosphate hydrate (HVPH). As seen from Figure 9, the characteristic
diffraction peaks of raw and modified coking coals are located at
12.36, 21.5, 24.9, 29.3, 35.6, and 38.5°. In the peak at 29.3°
where the HVPH signal is weakened, the acid reacts with HVPH and the
HVPH is dissolved, while the other mineral components stay unchanged.
New pores are created during the dissolution process; this is the
reason why specific surface area increased. The diffraction phase
corresponding to the diffraction peak at other positions is kaolinite
with little change; it has no effect on the adsorption performance
of the coking coal.25

Variations
of raw and modified coking coal interlamellar spacings
are studied; the result is listed in Table 2.

Coal Interlamellar Spacings

HVPH	29.3	3.04	3.34	3.33	3.33	3.33	
As seen from Table 2, the diffraction peak has no change in the interlayer
spacing of
the kaolinite in the modified coking coal, but the interlayer spacing
of the HVPH in the coking coal is increased. With the growth of the
interlayer spacing, the pore volume of coal is increased, and the
adsorption capacities of coking coals increased also.

3 Conclusions
The optimum acid-modified
concentration is 0.1 mol·L–1, and both the
optimum modification time and adsorption time are
120 min. At these conditions, the specific surface areas of AC-1,
AC-2, AC-3, AC-4, and AC-5 are 2.8984, 3.6366, 3.5687, 3.4315, and
3.2968 m2/g, and the quinoline removal rates by AC-1, AC-2,
AC-3, AC-4, and AC-5 are 77.64, 90.61, 87.68, 87.28, and 90.61%, respectively.
During the modification process, HVPH was dissolved by acids, and
the dissolution reaction was more intense with the increase in acid
concentration and modification time. The interlayer spacing at 29.3°
is increased, but the diffraction peaks and the interlayer spacing
had no change in other locations. The isothermal adsorption curve
of raw and modified coking coals is close to adsorption isotherm type
II; the modified coking coal sample contains a certain amount of mesopore
and macropore. Compared with raw coking coal, modification has been
proven to be an effective way to enhance the adsorption capacities
of four different acid-modified coking coals, and the rate of increase
is 15–20%. Among the four different acid modifications, the
adsorption capacity of AC-2 is the best. Modified coking coal has
great potential as a low-cost adsorbent for quinoline removal.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Raw Materials and Modified Coal Sample Preparation
The raw coking coal samples used in this paper were collected from
Linhuan Coking & Chemical Co., Ltd. The raw coking coal was crushed
and sieved, and then the particles with a 74 μm size were selected
as the experimental samples. The chemical agents were purchased from
Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., and the purity of agents was
AR.

Four different acids (HCl, HNO3, HF, and H2SO4) were used for coking coal modification, the
concentrations of acids were 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 mol·L–1, respectively. The amount of coking coal was 50 g,
and the acids (HCl, HNO3, HF, and H2SO4) were 250 mL. The modification process was performed with a magnetic
stirrer (IKA RET basic, Jinzhuo, Guangzhou, China), the modification
time was 120 min, the temperature was 298 K, and the speed of the
magnetic stirrer was 300 rpm. The pH of modified coking coal was adjusted
to 6.8–7.2 using deionized water, and the coal was then dried
in a vacuum oven for ∼720 min at 378 K. Coking coal samples
were modified by different times were obtained at the same other conditions,
except the modification times were 30, 120, 240, and 360 min, respectively.

The proximate analysis results of raw and modified coking coals

4.2 Quinoline Solution Preparation
An
amount of 1.00 g of quinoline was weighed using an electronic analytical
balance (BSA124S, Sartorius Scientific, Beijing, China), and then
quinoline was added to a 1000 mL volumetric flask. Next, the solution
was diluted to the volumetric flask scale line with deionized water.
The standard solution was diluted to 50 mg·L–1 after the volumetric flask was stirred for 6 h using a magnetic
stirrer.

4.3 Characterization Methods
The specific
surface area of coking coals was analyzed using a nitrogen adsorption
instrument (JW-BK122W, Jingwei Gaobo, Beijing, China), and both the
specific surface area calculation and pore over size analysis were
performed according to the adsorption isotherm. The surface functional
groups of coking coal under different acid modification conditions
were tested using a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyzer
(Nicolet iS10, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in the
range of 400–4000 cm–1. The mineral composition
of coking coal samples was tested by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and
the scan speed is 6°/min in the range of 10–90°.
The surface morphology characteristics of coal samples under different
modification conditions were characterized using a scanning electron
microscope (JSM-7800F, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) where the acceleration
voltage was 15 KV and the resolution was 0.8 nm.

4.4 Determination of Quinoline Concentration
Quinoline solution was scanned in a full wavelength using a UV
spectrophotometer (UV-1500, Meixi, Shanghai, China), and the wave
peak was the strongest when the wavelength was 299 nm. Quinoline standard
solution absorbance values were measured at the wavelength 299 nm,
and the concentrations of quinoline standard solutions were 5, 10,
20, 30, 40, and 60 mg·L–1. Fitting the standard
curve of quinoline solution, the result was shown as eq 1. 1  where x is
the absorbance value of the filtrate, and the quinoline solution concentration
was calculated through the standard curve.

4.5 Batch Adsorption Experiment
4.5.1 Adsorption Experiment by Coking Coal Modified
in Different Conditions
The adsorption experiments were carried
out at room temperature (298 K) in a 100 mL conical flask by mixing
2.5 g of coking coal with 50 mL of 50 mg·L–1 quinoline solution and shaking the conical flask using a digital
display water bath temperature oscillator with a speed of 120 rpm
for 120 min. The test samples were filtered after shaking was completed,
and the absorbance value of the filtrate was measured using a UV spectrophotometer.

4.5.2 Adsorption Kinetics Experiment
Compared with the adsorption experiment by coking coal modified in
different conditions, the adsorption kinetics experiment was conducted
at the same conditions, except the adsorption times were 5, 15, 45,
120, 270, 450, and 870 min. The adsorption kinetics experiment of
raw coking coal was performed at the same conditions.
