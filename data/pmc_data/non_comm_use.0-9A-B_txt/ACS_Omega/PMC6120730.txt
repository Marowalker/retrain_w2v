Malaria kills nearly
0.5 million people yearly and impacts the
lives of those living in over 90 countries where it is endemic. The
current treatment programs are threatened by increasing drug resistance.
Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is now clinically validated as
a target for antimalarial drug discovery as a triazolopyrimidine class
inhibitor (DSM265) is currently undergoing clinical development.
We discovered a related isoxazolopyrimidine series in a phenotypic
screen, later determining that it targeted DHODH. To determine if
the isoxazolopyrimidines could yield a drug candidate, we initiated
hit-to-lead medicinal chemistry. Several potent analogues were identified,
including a compound that showed in vivo antimalarial activity. The
isoxazolopyrimidines were more rapidly metabolized than their triazolopyrimidine
counterparts, and the pharmacokinetic data were not consistent with
the goal of a single-dose treatment for malaria.

Introduction
Malaria remains one
of the most significant infectious diseases
worldwide, with people in 91 countries at risk for infection by the Plasmodium parasite that is the causative agent of
the disease.1−4 The WHO reported 216 million cases in 2016 with nearly 0.5 million
deaths.5 Five Plasmodium species cause malaria in humans, but most deaths are caused by Plasmodium falciparum, in African children under
5 years old. With the implementation of artemisinin combination therapies
(ACT) for treatment, combined with expanded insect control measures,
the number of malaria deaths has been declining in the past decade.5 However, the progress is threatened by the emergence
of ACT treatment failures in Southeast Asia (first reported in Cambodia).6,7 Delayed parasite clearance times have been linked to mutations in
the propeller domain of a scaffolding protein called Kelch 13 that
lead to an increased survival of the ring-stage parasites upon artemisinin
treatment.8−10 A recent evidence suggests that additional resistance
mechanisms may also be emerging,11 and
of particular concern is the increased association between ACT treatment
failures and resistance toward the partner compound.3,12 The emergence of ACT resistance combined with treatment failures
with other antimalarial agents (e.g., chloroquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine)
highlights the need for new drug development for the treatment of
malaria.

A robust global effort to identify new drugs for the
treatment
of malaria is being fostered by collaborative efforts among not-for-profit
organizations, academia, and industry.3,13,14 This effort has led to the identification of four
new compounds that are currently in phase II clinical development,
including a fully synthetic peroxide OZ439,15,16 a novel imidazolopiperazine KAF156(17) of an unknown mechanism of action, a spiroindolone KAE609(18) that inhibits P. falciparum ATP4, and DSM265 (1)19 (Figure 1), an inhibitor of Plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). A number of additional compounds
are either in phase I clinical development or undergoing preclinical
testing.3,13,14 The need to
introduce all new agents as combination therapies to protect against
resistance, as well as the requirement to provide compounds efficacious
against several Plasmodium species,
and for use in both treatment and prevention, requires a robust pipeline
to meet clinical needs.20 Additionally,
the emphasis on identifying compounds with pharmacokinetic properties
that can support a single-dose cure to improve patient compliance
increases the challenge of identifying compounds with the required
properties.

Figure 1 Structures of PfDHODH inhibitors.

The identification of 1 has led to
the clinical validation
of DHODH as a new target for the treatment of malaria.21−24 DHODH catalyzes the fourth step in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis,
a pathway that is essential to the malaria parasite, because it lacks
the salvage enzymes typically found in other eukaryotic cells (including
in humans).25Plasmodium DHODH is a mitochondrial enzyme that utilizes flavin mononucleotide
(FMN) and coenzyme Q (CoQ) to catalyze the oxidation of dihydroorotate
to orotic acid. We used a target-based high-throughput screening approach
to identify the inhibitors of P. falciparum DHODH (PfDHODH), leading to the identification
of a triazolopyrimidine-based series with a potent and selective activity
against both Plasmodium DHODH and P. falciparum.25 Through
the use of structure-based iterative medicinal chemistry, we identified 1 from this series,19,26,27 and this compound is currently progressing through clinical development
where it has shown good safety and excellent efficacy for the treatment
of patients infected with P. falciparum as a single dose.21−24 Subsequently, we also identified additional compounds from the triazolopyrimidine
series with improved physicochemical properties (e.g., 2)22 (Figure 1).

In our search to identify additional
chemical scaffolds with the
DHODH inhibitory activity, which could be progressed for the treatment
of malaria, we uncovered an isoxazolopyrimidine scaffold that is closely
related to the triazolopyrimidine series (e.g., 1 and 2). The initial isoxazolopyrimidine hit 3 (Figure 1 and Table 1) was identified in a phenotypic
screen of the GSK compound library28 and
was later found to inhibit DHODH. To determine if the isoxazolopyrimidine
series had unique properties relative to the triazolopyrimidine series,
we undertook a hit-to-lead expansion, identifying several potent and
selective analogues.

Results and Discussion
Identification of the Isoxazolopyrimidine
Series
The
lead isoxazolopyrimidine (3; Table 1) was identified in a large-scale phenotypic
screen for antimalarial compounds; the dataset for this full screen
has previously been made public.28 The
compound 3 was subsequently identified as a DHODH inhibitor
with moderate potency against both the enzyme and the P. falciparum parasite in whole-cell assays (Table 1). The identification
of the target was based on structural similarity to the triazolopyrimidine
series (Figure 1),
and on secondary screening assays, including the screening of a transgenic
parasite line that expresses cytoplasmic yeast DHODH29 and is therefore resistant to inhibitors that target mitochondrial-type
DHODHs such as Plasmodium DHODH.

Chemistry
To improve the potency of 3 and
to build in the characteristics required for good in vivo activity,
we undertook a hit-to-lead expansion of the series. Compound 3 showed some disconnect between the enzyme and parasite data,
suggesting potential permeability issues, as potency on the parasite
was less than that on the enzyme (Table 1). It was also rapidly metabolized in mouse
liver microsomes (Table 2) and showed poor exposure when dosed orally in mice (Cmax = 0.014 μM; AUCinf = 0.0069 μM·h
at 10 mg/kg based on blood levels). Given the structural similarities
to the triazolopyrimidine series, we reasoned that the approaches
used to improve the potency and metabolic stability in the triazolopyrimidine
series might translate to the isoxazolopyrimidines, allowing us to
use both the prior data from the triazolopyrimidines and the X-ray
structure of 1 bound to PfDHODH as guides
for medicinal chemistry (Figure 2). In the triazolopyrimidine series, the aniline substituents
that had para-substituted −CF3 or −SF5 functional groups (e.g., Figure 1; 1) showed both the best potency
and metabolic stability of those that were tested,26,27,30 whereas the addition of the pyridinyl CF3-aniline reduced log D and improved the aqueous
solubility (e.g., Figure 1; 2).31 Thus, we systematically
incorporated each of these substitutions into the isoxazolopyrimidine
series. In the triazolopyrimidines, substantial increases in potency
were achieved by substituting the C2 carbon with linear fluorohydrocarbons
(e.g., CF2CH3 of 1);26 however, as this position was not available
for substitution in the isoxazolopyrimidines, we also tested the effect
of replacing the isoxazolopyrimidine ring methyls with CF3 on the potency and metabolic stability. Because of the proximity
of the C2 carbon to the hydroxyl group of Y528 in the PfDHODH structure bound to 1 (Figure 2), we also tried the substitution of the
methyl group with CH2OH. Finally, in the triazolopyrimidines,
we found that the replacement of the aniline with tetrahydro-2-naphthyl
derivatives could boost the potency, whereas that with 2-indanyls
provided good metabolic stability;32 hence,
the derivatives with these substitutions were also prepared.

The
target compounds were synthesized as outlined in Schemes 1–4. The preparation of
the 3-substituted-5-amino-4-carbamoyl isoxazoles (6, 19, 27) required different approaches depending
on the final target. The generation of these intermediates was followed
by cyclization with triethyl orthoacetate or trifluoroacetic anhydride,
which afforded the corresponding isoxazolopyrimidone intermediates
(7, 20, 28). Subsequently,
these were converted to the desired isoxazolopyrimidine derivatives
(9–16, 23, 30–32, 35–37) by chlorination and amination with appropriate
amines.

Scheme 1 Scheme 2 Scheme 3 The synthesis of the isoxazolopyrimidines (9–16) is illustrated in Scheme 1(33) The compound 5-amino-3-methylisoxazole-4-carbonitrile
(5) was prepared by the reaction of methylethoxymethylenemalononitrile
(4) with hydroxylamine under basic conditions. This amino
nitrile (5) was converted to 5-amino-3-methylisoxazole-4-carboxamide
(6) by treatment with concentrated sulfuric acid. Further,
cyclization with a mixture of triethyl orthoacetate and acetic anhydride
under microwave conditions gave 3,6-dimethylisoxazolo[5,4-d]-pyrimidin-4(5H)-one (7).
Pyrimidinone (7) was converted to 4-chloro-3,6-dimethylisoxazolo[5,4-d]-pyrimidine (8), with the excess phosphorous
oxychloride refluxing at 80 °C for 10 h. This upon treatment
with the substituted amines in EtOH/diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA)–isopropyl
alcohol (IPA) MW/tetrahydrofuran (THF)-Seal tube/NaOtBu-tert-butylxphos–THF resulted in the desired 3,6-dimethyl-substituted
isoxazolopyrimidine derivatives (9–16). The displacement
of 4-chloropyrimidines by amines generally proceeded smoothly by heating
with organic bases like DIPEA in ethanol or simple heating in alcoholic
solvents like ethanol or IPA. However, these standard conditions failed
to work in the following two isoxazolopyrimidines. Mostly, unreacted
starting materials were recovered, and hence subjecting to harsher
conditions like refluxing in sealed tube for 3 days and Buchwald conditions
was adopted to obtain 15 and 16, respectively.

An alternate route was attempted to achieve the target 6-methyl
isoxazolo[5,4-d]pyrimidin-3-yl)methanol derivative 23 (Scheme 2).34,35 The reaction of cyanoacetamide (17) with ethyl oximinochloroacetate (18) in the presence
of sodium ethoxide yielded ethyl 5-amino-4-carbomoylisoxazole-3-carboxamide
(19). Followed by cyclization, chlorination and amination
reactions were carried out under similar conditions as shown in Scheme 1 to obtain the intermediate 22. Finally, the reduction of ester (22) with
sodium borohydride in THF–MeOH afforded ((6-methyl-4-((4-(pentafluorosulfanyl)phenyl)amino)isoxazolo[5,4-d]pyrimidin-3-yl)methanol (23).

The synthesis
of 30–32 was performed as outlined
in Scheme 3. To prepare
the starting precursor 5-amino-3-(trifluoromethyl)isoxazole-4-carboxamide
(27), we utilized the route previously described.36 First, trifluoroacetaldehyde hydrate (24) treated with hydroxylamine hydrochloride in methanol at
ambient temperature for 16 h afforded trifluoroacetaldehyde oxime
(25). Bromination of the resulting oxime with n-bromosuccinamide in dry dimethylformamide (DMF) afforded
trifluoroacetohydroximoyl bromide (26). Compound 26 was cyclized with cyanoacetamide (17) to give
the corresponding 5-amino-3-(trifluoromethyl)isoxazole-4-carboxamide
(27). Finally, the 6-methyl-3-trifluoromethyl isoxazolo[5,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives (30–32) were
prepared from 27 by using similar conditions, as illustrated
in Scheme 1.

Finally, we adopted the synthetic route in Scheme 4 to prepare 3-methyl-6-trifluoromethyl isoxazolopyrimidines
(35–37) from the corresponding isoxozolo carboxamide
(6) by cyclization with trifluoroacetic anhydride, followed
by chlorination and amination with the appropriate amines.

Scheme 4 DHODH Inhibition and Antiplasmodial Efficacy in Vitro
The compounds were tested against DHODH from P. falciparum and evaluated for activity against the P. falciparum 3D7 parasites in whole-cell assays (Table 1). Similar to the triazolopyrimidine series,26,32 the best potency on both PfDHODH and P. falciparum 3D7 parasites was observed for compounds
containing SF5-aniline (14 and 32) and those with tetrahydro-2-naphthyl amines (9 and 11). The SF5-aniline group was 2–5-fold
more potent within this series than the CF3-aniline group
(14 vs 15; 32 vs 31; 36 vs 35). In contrast, these two groups
were fairly equivalent with respect to in vitro potency within the
triazolopyrimidines,26 though clearly in
that case SF5-aniline provided better plasma exposure and
more potent in vivo activity. Within the tetrahydro-2-naphthyl amines,
compounds with the halogens substituted at the 7-position (9 and 11) were significantly more potent than those with
the halogens substituted at the 6-position (10 and 12). However, the most potent compounds from the series (9, 11, 14) were 2–4-fold
less potent than 1 on P. falciparum parasites, although they were close to meeting the development criteria
in this assay (EC50 < 10 nM). Of note, the compounds
containing tetrahydro-2-naphthyl amines were assayed as racemic mixtures;
so, the potency of the pure active enantiomer would be expected to
be ∼2-fold better, based on the data for similarly substituted
triazolopyrimidines.32 The substitution
of either the R1 or R2 methyl group with CF3 led to a reduction in potency, with the R2 substitution
leading to a greater loss than the R1 substitution. Similarly,
substitution of the R1 methyl group with CH2OH also led to reduced potency, suggesting that this group was unable
to form an H-bond with Y528 in the pocket, or was too sterically hindered
to bind well. The compounds with 2-indanyl amines (13, 30, 37) were less potent than those with
tetrahydro-2-naphthyl amine or SF5-aniline, similar to
what we observed previously for the triazolopyrimidines.32 Select compounds were also tested against DHODH
from Plasmodium vivax, and to assess
species selectivity, the human enzyme was also assayed (Table 1). The activity on P. vivax DHODH ranged from 2–3-fold more potent
to 2-fold less potent, depending on the compound. The four compounds
that were tested also retained good selectivity versus the human enzyme,
although 31 showed modest activity on the human enzyme,
suggesting that replacing the R1 methyl group with CF3 could lead to reduced species selectivity depending on the
context.

X-ray Crystallography
To assess the binding mode, a
co-crystal structure was obtained between PfDHODH
and 15. The structure was solved by molecular replacement
to 1.99 Å resolution, with an Rwork/Rfree of 0.163/0.206 (Table S1). The compound 15 bound to the same
site as observed previously for the triazolopyrimidines,19,26,32,37,38 and the overall structure was similar to
these previous examples (Figure 2). The compound 15 was shifted in the
pocket, so that the isoxazolopyrimidine ring was closer to the FMN
cofactor than the triazolopyrimdine ring. In response to this shift,
several other residues in the binding pocket also moved slightly,
including F188, to accommodate the slightly different binding mode.
However, like 1, 15 makes H-bonds between
the bridging NH (N1) and His185, and between the pyrimidine nitrogen
(N3) and Arg265, that are likely to contribute significantly to the
binding energy.

Physicochemical Properties and in Vitro Metabolism
To provide a preliminary indication if the compounds were likely
to show good plasma exposure after oral dosing, selected compounds
were tested to measure their physicochemical properties and to assess
the in vitro metabolism in the presence of human and mouse liver microsomes
(Table 2). Overall,
the isoxazolopyrimidines showed poor solubility at pH 6.5, and when
comparing matched compounds between the isoxazolopyrimidines and the
triazolopyrimidines, solubility was 2–4-fold lower for the
isoxazolopyrimidines [e.g., 1 vs 14; 2 vs 16; 38(32) vs 13 (see Table 3)]. For all compounds tested, metabolic stability was
significantly worse for the isoxazolopyrimidines compared to the triazolopyrimidines,
and no compounds were identified that showed similar metabolic stability
compared to 1 or 2.19,31 These data suggested that the isoxazolopyrimidines were unlikely
to provide the type of sustained plasma exposure necessary to meet
the product profile of a single-dose cure.

In Vivo
Pharmacokinetic Studies in Mice
To directly
assess the exposure after oral dosing, two compounds in the series
were dosed in mice. The compound 14 was chosen as one
of the most potent compounds because it was the isoxazolopyrimidine
equivalent to the clinical candidate 1, allowing the
assessment of the performance of SF5-aniline within the
isoxazolopyrimidine series. The compound 13 was dosed
as the comparator to 38,32 which also contains difluoro 2-indanyl amine and showed good plasma
exposure within the context of the triazolopyrimidine series (Table 3). In both cases,
the triazolopyrimidines (1 and 38) showed
a much higher exposure than the matched isoxazolopyrimidine (14 and 13), as measured by both Cmax and AUC (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Exposure profiles following a single oral administration
of 10
(1 and 14) or 20 (13 and 38) mg/kg to mice, respectively. The data represent plasma
concentrations for all compounds except 14, which represents
blood concentration. To aid comparison between the compounds, data
for 13 and 38 have been scaled to a dose
of 10 mg/kg, assuming dose-proportional kinetics. The symbols represent
individual data points (1, 38, 13) or mean ± SD (n = 5) (14). Note
that the error bars for 14 are smaller than the symbols
at most time points.

In Vivo Efficacy in the SCID Mouse Model of P.
falciparum
To assess the in vivo efficacy
of 14, it was dosed in the standard severe combined immunodeficient
(SCID) mouse model of P. falciparum infection. The compound was dosed orally for 4 days (dose levels
of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 mg/kg). Parasitemia was monitored throughout
the 7-day study, and blood levels were measured for 24 h after the
first dose (Figure 4). The dose required to reach ED90 (90% reduction in parasitemia)
was determined from the data collected 24 h after the last dose. The
ED90 for 14 of ∼63 mg/kg was minimally
8-fold higher than that for 1 when dosed in the same
model using once daily (QD) dosing.26 The
poor efficacy was likely a reflection of the much lower plasma exposure
of 14 relative to 1 (Table 3). Additionally, as 60 mg/kg was the highest
dose tested, the minimal dose to provide the maximum parasite clearance
was not reached.

Conclusions
Plasmodium DHODH
is a clinically validated new target for the treatment of
malaria. Triazolopyrimidine 1 is currently in phase II
clinical development for this disease.22 To assess the potential for a related isoxazolopyrimidine series
to yield a potential backup candidate that could be progressed to
preclinical development, we undertook a hit-to-lead optimization of
a series based on a hit from a previously published whole-cell screen
(Figure 5). Although
we identified analogues with good in vitro potency that met the development
criteria, the isoxazolopyrimidines were less attractive at all levels
than their matched triazolopyrimidine partners. Most importantly,
the isoxazolopyrimidines were less soluble and were much less metabolically
stable. As a consequence, they showed significantly lower plasma exposure
and substantially reduced in vivo efficacy. The best analogue 14, which, like 1, contains an SF5-aniline substituent, required too high a dose for efficacy in vivo
to meet the development criteria,14,20 and the relatively
short half-life in mice suggests as well that it would not have the
pharmacokinetic profile needed to reach the goal of a single-dose
cure.

Experimental Procedures
DHODH
Enzyme Purification and Assay
P. falciparum, P. vivax, and human DHODH were expressed
as N-terminal truncations lacking
the mitochondrial transmembrane domain as His6-tag fusions
to facilitate purification from the Escherichia coli BL21 phage-resistant cells by Ni2+–agarose column
chromatography/gel-filtration column chromatography, as previously
described.26,30,37PfDHODH for crystallography was additionally truncated
to remove a surface loop to facilitate crystallization, also as previously
described.37,39 A dye-based spectrophotometric
assay that follows the reduction of 2,5-dichloroindophenol (DCIP)
at 600 nm catalyzed by DHODH was used to determine the inhibitor potency
as previously described26,32 The enzyme and substrate
concentrations were as follows: DHODH (5–10 nM), l-dihydroorotate (0.2 mM), CoQd (0.02 mM), and DCIP (0.12
mM). The assay buffer contained 100 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl,
10% glycerol, and 0.05% Triton X-100. The stock solutions of the isoxazolopyrimidine-based
compounds and any control DHODH inhibitors were prepared in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) and protected from light in dark amber vials. The
IC50 values (concentration that gave 50% enzyme inhibition)
were determined by collecting the dose response data over a range
of inhibitor concentrations (0.01–100 μM) and fitting
the data to the log[I] versus response (three parameters)
equation in GraphPad Prism. The reported error represents the 95%
confidence interval of the fit. All data were collected in triplicate.

In Vitro Parasite Assays
The P. falciparum 3D7 parasites were grown in RPMI-1640 containing 0.5% Albumax-II
as previously described.26 The final DMSO
concentration in the media was held constant at 0.2%. The P. falciparum growth assays were performed using
the SYBR-green method after 72 h of growth in the presence of drug.38 The log[I] versus response
variable slope (four parameters) equation (GraphPad prism) was used
to fit the data and to define the effective concentration (EC50) that reduced parasitemia by 50%. The reported errors were
calculated from the data collected minimally in triplicate and represent
the 95% confidence interval of the fit.

X-ray Crystallography
PfDHODH (amino
acids 158–569, Δ384–413) was expressed and purified
as described.37 The protein/ligand complex
was made by incubating 50 μL of protein at 12.8 mg/mL (in 10
mM HEPES pH 7.8, 100 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mM dl-dithiothreitol,
and 1 mM N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide) with 1 μL N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide (500 mM stock), 0.5
μL l-dihydroorotate (200 mM stock), and 0.5 μL
compound (200 mM stock in DMSO) at room temperature for 30 min. The
crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 20 °C
using drops consisting of 1 μL protein solution and 1 μL
crystallization solution (24% PEG 3350, 100 mM potassium fluoride,
and 100 mM MES pH 6.5) suspended over a reservoir of the crystallization
solution. The crystals were harvested using the reservoir solution,
containing 20% glycerol, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The
X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the European Synchrotron
Radiation Facility. The data were processed and scaled using autoPROC,40 utilizing XDS,41 POINTLESS,42 AIMLESS,42 STARANISO,43 and the CCP4 suite of programs.44 The crystal space group is P21, with the unit cell dimensions a = 58.7 Å, b = 163.0 Å, c = 64.7 Å, α
= 90°, β = 112.9°, γ = 90°, and two protein
molecules in the asymmetric unit. The data collection statistics are
given in the Supporting Information, Table
S1. The structures were determined using the coordinates of an isomorphous
unliganded protein model (unpublished), with the preliminary refinement
carried out using autoBUSTER.45 The ligands
were clearly visible in the resulting Fo–Fc electron density maps (Supporting Information, Figure S1). The initial
structure refinement was carried out at 2.65 Å, which was subsequently
extended to 1.99 Å to include additional reflections, following
the analysis of merged intensity data for anisotropy of diffraction
using STARANISO. Coot46 was used for model
building, with the refinement completed using autoBUSTER. The statistics
for the final models are given in the Supporting Information, Table S1. The coordinates and structure factors
have been deposited in PDB under the accession code 6GJG.

Physicochemical
Properties
log D7.4 was estimated
using a chromatographic method as described
previously.24 The aqueous solubility was
assessed using a plate-based method, whereby the compound in DMSO
was spiked into a pH 6.5 phosphate buffer (final DMSO content 1 v/v
%) and the samples analyzed by nephelometry to determine the solubility
range based on a method described previously.24

In Vitro Metabolism
The microsome in vitro intrinsic
clearance (in vitro CLint) and predicted hepatic extraction
(Eh) ratio of the selected compounds were
determined using human and mouse liver microsomes (BD Gentest, BD
Biosciences, Bedford, MA or Sekisui XenTech, LLC, Kansas City, KS)
following incubation (37 °C) at a compound concentration of 0.5
or 1 μM and microsomal protein concentration of 0.4 or 0.5 mg/mL.
The metabolic reactions were initiated by the addition of a reduced
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-regenerating system
(1 mg/mL NADPH, 1 mg/mL glucose-6-phosphate, and 1 U/mL glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase) and MgCl2 (0.67 mg/mL) and were quenched
by the addition of ice-cold acetonitrile. The amount of compound remaining
in the sample supernatant at selected time points over 0–60
min was quantified by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
(LC–MS). The methods used for the determination of in vitro
CLint and Eh values have been
described previously.26

Animal Studies
All animal studies were ethically reviewed
and carried out in accordance with either the Australian Code of Practice
for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes (mouse PK
studies for 13) or European Directive 2010/63/EEC and
the GSK Policy on the Care, Welfare, and Treatment of Animals (mouse
PK studies for 3 and 14 and SCID mouse studies
for 14).

Mouse PK
In vivo PK studies of 13 were
conducted in male Swiss outbred mice. The compound was administered
by oral gavage (10 mL/kg) of a suspension formulation containing 0.5
w/v % carboxymethylcellulose, 0.5 v/v % benzyl alcohol, and 0.4 v/v
% Tween 80. Blood was collected over 24 h by either submandibular
bleed or terminal cardiac puncture (two samples per mouse) into heparinized
tubes, and plasma was separated by centrifugation and stored at −80
°C until analysis. The compound concentrations were quantified
by LC–MS following protein precipitation with acetonitrile
containing an internal standard. A Waters Acquity UPLC with a Supelco
Ascentis Express RP Amide column (50 × 2.1 mm, 2.7 μm)
was used for chromatography with the mobile phase buffer 0.05% formic
acid in water and 0.05% formic acid in methanol mixed by a linear
gradient (flow rate 0.4 mL/min; injection volume 3 μL; and cycle
time 4 min). Positive electrospray ionization mass spectrometry with
multiple reaction monitoring was used for detection on a Waters Xevo
TQ mass spectrometer (cone voltage 35 V and collision energy 20 V).
The concentrations were quantified by comparison to calibration standards
prepared in blank mouse plasma, and the pharmacokinetic parameters
were determined by noncompartmental analysis.

For 3 and 14, mouse PK was performed by oral gavage of suspension
formulations prepared in 0.1 w/v % methylcellulose. Peripheral blood
samples (25 μL) were taken serially from 0.5 to 24 h, mixed
with water (25 μL) to lyse the erythrocytes, and stored at −80
°C until use. A 96-well plate filter system (MultiScreen Solvinert
0.45 μm Hydrophobic PTFE; Millipore) was used to perform protein
precipitation by liquid–liquid extraction. Per well, acetonitrile/methanol
(80:20, v/v) (0.12 mL) and internal standard was mixed with blood
lysate (10 μL). The plates were vortexed (10 min), filtered,
and analyzed by LC–MS/MS (Sciex API 4000 Triple Quadrupole
Mass Spectrometer, Sciex, Division of MDS Inc., Toronto, Canada) in
positive ion mode with electrospray ionization. Phoenix, version 6.3
(Phoenix WinNonlin, Certara L.P.) was used to perform noncompartmental
analysis to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters.

SCID Mouse
Efficacy Studies
The in vivo efficacy of 14 was
measured against P. falciparumPf3D70087/N9 growing in the peripheral
blood of NOD-scidIL2Rγnull mice (Jackson Laboratory,
USA) (23–36 g) engrafted with human erythrocytes as described.47 Human biological samples were sourced and used
in accordance with the terms defined in the informed consent of the
IRB/EC-approved protocol. The parasites (20 × 106)
were inoculated by intravenous injection, and antimalarial efficacy
was assessed using a standard “4-day test”. Blood parasitemia
was measured by FACS analysis. Compound 14 was administered
in vehicle (1% methylcellulose) by oral gavage QD for four consecutive
days starting on the third day after infection. The actual administered
doses were determined by the measurement of the formulation concentrations.
The compound concentrations in either the formulations or the blood
from the infected mice were measured by LC–MS–MS (described
above). The efficacy markers (ED90, AUCED90)
were determined on the seventh day after infection, one day after
the last dose.

Chemistry
General Methods
Commercial suppliers were used to source
reagents and starting materials, which were then used without further
purification unless indicated. Flash chromatography was performed
with the Biotage (prepacked) silica-gel columns forming the stationary
phase and the analytical grade solvents as the eluent. Preloaded silica
gel 60 F254 plates were employed to monitor the reaction
progress by thin layer chromatography, and the results were visualized
by UV light and iodine vapor. The reported yields were for purified
product and were not optimized. The proton nuclear magnetic resonance
(1H NMR) spectra were determined at room temperature using
Bruker AVANCE 300 and 400 MHz spectrometers with chemical shifts provided
in parts per million (δ) and coupling constants in Hertz. The
residual solvent peaks from the 1H NMR spectra were used
as internal standards (7.26 ppm for CDCl3, 2.50 ppm for
DMSO-d6, and 3.34 ppm for MeOD). Spin
multiplicities are defined with the following abbreviations: s (singlet),
br s (broad singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), dd (doublet
of doublets), dt (doublet of triplets), and m (multiplet). An Agilent
Liquid Chromatograph—6320 Ion trap or 6130 mass spectrometer
was used to record the total ion current traces by electrospray positive
and negative ionization (ES+/ES−). The LC–MS conditions
for analytical chromatography were as follows: Column, Zorbax XDB
C18 (Agilent Technologies, 50 × 4.6 mm) or Atlantis dC18 (Waters,
50 × 4.6 mm), both with a stationary phase particle size of 5
μM. The aqueous solvent (A) was 0.1% HCOOH or TFA in water and
the organic solvent (B) was acetonitrile. The samples were separated
at a column temperature of 25 °C using a run time of 7 min and
the following gradient steps: 0–4.0 min 10–95% of B,
4.0–5.0 min 95% of B, 5.0–5.5 min 95–10% of B,
and 5.5–7.0 min 10% of B, with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min (injection
volume 2 μL). Detection was at the UV wavelength range (210–400
nm). An Atlantis dC18 column from Waters (5 μm, 250 × 4.6
mm) with a linear elution gradient ranging from 0 to 100% ACN over
30 min at a flow rate of 1 mL/min was used for analytical high-performance
liquid chromatography analyses. A purity of >95% LC–MS has
been established for all the reported compounds.
