Selectivity in heterogeneous
catalysis is essential while being
the most difficult parameters to obtain from theoretical simulations.
Although theory holds the key for catalytic design, in the search
of complex reaction networks, intermediates are considered static
and different configurations for addition reactions are not considered.
Here, we present the crucial role of intermediate dynamics to understand
reaction selectivity of heterogeneous catalysts by studying the dynamic
properties. The hydrogenation of two different intermediates hydroperoxide
(OOH) and vinyl (HCCH2) is crucial to in the direct synthesis
of water peroxide and alkyne semi-hydrogenation are taken as examples
on the bare and alloyed surfaces. For them, the reaction network is
studied by density functional theory coupled to molecular dynamics
to present the role of rotations and how they affect paths for the
addition of atomic hydrogen to lead to the products. In summary, the
thermodynamic selectivity can be mapped to the dynamic control in
the kinetics of the process.

1 Introduction
Hydrogenation typically constitutes the addition of pairs of hydrogen
atoms to a molecule, often an alkene, and plays a key role in chemical
synthesis. It requires a catalyst to make the reaction proceed at
a reasonable rate. Heterogeneously catalyzed hydrogenations are one
of the most important processes of the chemical industry which involves
both thermodynamics and kinetics. From thermodynamic point of view,
the stability of the products control product distribution in a chemical
reaction. Kinetics describes the relative rates of corresponding product
formation and how fast equilibrium is reached, thus in turn to the
relative activation energies.

Noble metal species with different
size (single atoms, nanoclusters,
and nanoparticles) show different catalytic behaviors for various
hydrogenation reactions. Many factors including the particle size,
shape, chemical composition, metal–support interaction, and
metal–reactant/solvent interaction can have significant influences
on the catalytic properties of noble metal catalysts.1 In general, the enhanced performance of noble metal catalysts
may be rationalized by a combination of ligand, geometric, and/or
ensemble effects. Ligand and geometric effects which describe influences
of charge transfer between nearest neighbor atoms, orbital rehybridization
and lattice strain generally affect the strength of interactions of
reactants, intermediates, and products. In our previous work we have
shown the outstanding activity, selectivity, and stability of ligand-modified
Pd nanoparticles in the direct synthesis of H2O2.2 On the other hand, the ensemble effects
result when more than one reactive site, composed of different metal
atoms, catalyzes distinct steps in a particular reaction mechanism.
Our recent study showed that the supported palladium sulfides possess
unique ensembles with face- and phase-dependent geometric and electronic
characteristics and high stability, demonstrating exciting potential
as catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of alkynes.3

Heterogeneous bimetallic catalysts, formed
by adding a second metal
to a host metal, garnered much research attention recently because
they exhibit distinctly different and often superior activities for
many chemical transformations as compared to pure monometallic systems
as determined in experimental and theoretical investigations (e.g.,
selectivity, activity, and stability).4−10

The palladium–gold (Pd–Au) bimetallic catalyst
has
shown promising catalytic properties in aerobic oxidation of primary
alcohols, direct synthesis of H2O2, hydrocarbon
hydrogenation, CO oxidation, and oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes.11−14 For example, it was found that isolated single Pd atoms constitute
the minimum ensemble needed for CO adsorption while a larger set is
required for proton adsorption. For hydrogen peroxide formation, Au
shows a promotional effect because it drives the formation of the
preferred selective catalytic ensemble.15 Other Au-containing alloys like AuNi have been reported active in
oxidized CO at very low temperatures (77 K) because of the participation
of Au in the active sites adsorbing the reactants.16 Furthermore, the combination of silver and palladium (Ag–Pd)
has been widely applied in ethylene hydrogenation,17 hydrogenation of CO2 to produce formic acid,18 hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene, and
oxygen reduction.6,19,20 It was shown that for alloys of AgPd, the surface contained single
Pd atoms surrounded by Ag atoms, which maximized the ability of a
hetero atomic site to amplify the activity of each Pd atom.6

Moreover, acetylene hydrogenation reactions
have been studied theoretically
on both pure Pd and bimetallic PdAg surfaces.17,21−24 It is found that on alloying with Ag and Au, the selectivity of
Pd(111) surfaces for the hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene is
enhanced.21

Much is understood about
heterogeneous bimetallic catalysts for
hydrogenations but some issues remain unresolved and a deeper understanding
of this mechanism on the bimetallic catalysts is necessary for a rational
design of selective hydrogenation catalysts. We herein first report
and compare the reaction network for two different hydrogenation reactions
on the bare and alloyed surfaces by density functional theory (DFT).
For the first reaction we study the O2 hydrogenation in
the direct synthesis of water peroxide mechanism on Pd and PdAu surfaces
and for the second one the alkyne hydrogenation over Pd and AgPd surfaces
is taken as another example. Particularly, the reaction barriers of
hydroperoxide (OOH) and vinyl (HCCH2) hydrogenation over
both bare and alloyed surfaces are compared to each other. Second,
the dynamic aspects of two different intermediates (OOH and HCCH2) on the bare and alloyed surfaces are investigated by Born-Oppenheimer
molecular dynamics (MD) calculations to understand reaction selectivity
of heterogeneous catalysts. The paper is organized as follows: in
the next section, the details of the computational methods employed
to compute the reaction profiles and molecular dynamic calculations
are presented. In Sections 2.1 and 2.2, the energy profiles for oxygen
hydrogenation on Pd and PdAu surfaces and acetylene hydrogenation
on Pd and AgPd surfaces are described. Section 2.3 covers the molecular dynamic calculations
of OOH and HCCH2 intermediates on different surfaces. In
the last section we summarize our studies and present the conclusions.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Oxygen Hydrogenation on
Pd and PdAu Surfaces
All possible reactions in the direct
synthesis of hydrogen peroxide
(DSHP) mechanism are summarized in Figure 1a. The scheme shows not only the hydrogenation
steps conducting to H2O2 formation but also
lateral decomposition paths readily including dissociation of reactants
and intermediates, 2O, O + OH, 2OH, or over hydrogenation to O + H2O and OH + H2O. Combining several of these steps
they provide all possible decomposition routes.

Figure 1 Competitive paths involved
in the direct hydrogen peroxide synthesis
(a) and acetylene hydrogenation reactions (b). Reactions that drive
to the formation of the desired products H2O2 and C2H4 formation are written in green color.

The DSHP mechanism essentially requires that oxygen
is adsorbed
molecularly on the catalyst surface, and the dissociated hydrogen
atoms are added to it sequentially at both oxygen ends. However, several
of the intermediates, O2, O2H, and H2O2 are likely to undergo spurious reactions like O–O
bond scission and over hydrogenation to an already formed OH fragment. Table 1 summarizes all possible
reactions in this mechanism including reactant adsorption, hydrogenation,
and product desorption with the respective reaction energies and activation
barriers and Table 2 reports the adsorption energies for the all intermediate states.
The full energy profiles for the DSHP mechanism on Pd and PdAu surfaces
are illustrated in Figure 2a.

The first reaction step of the H2O2 direct
synthesis mechanism on Pd and PdAu surfaces is the adsorption of molecular
O2. This process is exothermic (−1.22 eV for Pd
and −0.78 eV for PdAu, 1 eV = 96 kJ mol–1) on both the surfaces where the O2 molecule adsorbed
on a tfcc configuration on the Pd while it adsorbed on a tbt configuration
on the PdAu surface. The O–O bond stretches from 1.23 Å
in the gas phase to 1.36 Å on the Pd and 1.31 Å on the PdAu
surfaces. On the Pd surface, the charge transfer to the oxygen atom
on the fcc site (−0.29 e) is slightly larger than to the atom
on the top site (−0.23 e), thus causing the magnetic moment
of the atom at the top site to be slightly smaller. On the PdAu surface,
the charge transfer to both the oxygen atoms (−0.20 e) is similar
and the partial magnetic moment for each atom is 0.27 μB. Table 3 compiles
the charges and magnetic moments that characterize O2,
OOH, and H2O2 species. This behavior of O2 molecule on both Pd and PdAu surfaces is compatible with
a superoxo (O2–) character. These results
indicate that O2* cleavage to 2O* is more feasible on the Pd surface than that on
the PdAu one.

Hydrogenation of O2 leads
to the formation of the key
peroxyl (OOH) intermediate. On both the surfaces, this process is
exothermic and energetically more favorable than the dissociation
to 2O*. The reaction energy and activation barrier for this reaction
on the clean surface are −0.11 and 0.68 eV. The corresponding
values on the top PdAu surface are −0.22 and 0.68 eV. The O–O
bond length of the OOH intermediate on Pd and PdAu surfaces is 1.50
and 1.44 Å, respectively, which is compatible with a peroxo (O22–) bond length. The smaller bond length
of O–O indicates that on the PdAu surface OOH dissociation
on PdAu is more impeded than on the clean surface.

The addition
of the second hydrogen atom to the OOH intermediate
leads to the formation of H2O2*; at the same time, this process also
may yield water. In addition, the dissociation of OOH* to O* + OH*
may happen as well. On the clean surface, the barrier energy of both
side reactions is lower than the formation of H2O2 limiting the selectivity of the clean Pd surface as a catalyst.
Dissociation of the OOH* intermediate to OH* + O* is hindered by 0.44
eV on the bare surface.

However, as shown in Figure 2a, different positions for
OOH hydrogenation are possible:
the attack on the already hydrogenated O, or as syn or trans on the nonhydrogenated one. The first
reaction on the bare surface is hindered by a barrier of 0.35 eV and
leads to the formation of coadsorbed water and oxygen (H2O* + O*). As for the two attacks on the resting O both lead to the
formation of H2O2, the barrier being 0.89 eV
with a reaction energy of −0.21 eV, which indicates that this
is an exothermic process. Hydrogenation of OOH on the PdAu surface
is more exothermic than that on the clean surface with an activation
barrier and reaction energy of 0.39 and −0.45 eV, respectively,
thereby the PdAu surface should be more selective than the clean Pd
surface for H2O2 formation. This process on
the PdAu surface has lower energetic requirements than side reactions
(0.53 eV for OH* + O* and 0.56 eV for H2O* + O*). This
means that the two channels for selectivity reduction (OOH breaking
and over hydrogenation to H2O* + O*) are no longer open.
The bond length of O–O in H2O2 on the
PdAu surface is 1.48 Å which is smaller than that on top of the
clean surface (1.52 Å) (Table 3).

Still two routes are possible for dissociation
of this moiety on
the surface, namely, direct decomposition to 2OH or over hydrogenation
to coadsorbed water and a hydroxyl group. The activation barriers
for decomposition and over hydrogenation on the bare Pd surface are
smaller than H2O2 desorption. By comparing the
H2O2 steps, it can be judged that on the clean
Pd surface no H2O2 will be obtained. In contrast,
the barrier for H2O2 desorption on the PdAu
surface is lower than the barriers for H2O2 decomposition
and over hydrogenation. As a result, other intermediates cannot compete
with H2O2 desorption and H2O2 will be desorbed from the PdAu surface.

On the other
hand, oxygen can dissociate to 2O* on the surface
and the process is detrimental to selectivity. However, the activation
energy for this reaction on both surfaces is smaller than that of
the desired hydrogenation to OOH* this barrier energy is increased
by 0.23 eV on the PdAu surface with respect to the Pd one. This process
on both Pd and PdAu surfaces is exothermic with a reaction energy
of −1.16 and −0.81 eV. The next side reaction is hydrogenation
of oxygen atoms: the first hydrogenation on both surfaces has a higher
barrier than the second one. The last side reaction (OH* + OH* →
H2O* + O*) has the same barrier energy (0.42 eV) on both
surfaces with a reaction energy of −0.5 and −0.4 eV
for Pd and PdAu surfaces, respectively.

PdAu alloys have been
found to be active and selective in different
reactions showing complex mechanisms. In the present case the first
main difference with the clean Pd(111) surface is the increase in
the barrier for O2 dissociation for the PdAu case with
respect to the Pd one (from 0.76 to 0.99 eV). This is due to two main
aspects, first due to the presence of Au blocks, active sites enforce
a different path for O2 dissociation, see Figure 3. In addition, hydrogen transfer
is eased because of the presence of Au on the surface; the result
being a better branching reaction than in the previous case. In addition,
the resting hydrogenation reactions are also more competitive than
in the previous case, thus reducing side reactions.

state for the decomposition of molecular
oxygen on the Pd surface, and on a gold-containing alloy, PdAu.

2.2 Acetylene Hydrogenation
on Pd and AgPd Surfaces
The reaction scheme for acetylene
hydrogenation is also described
in Figure 1b. The complete
reaction pathways of acetylene hydrogenation with all respective reaction
energies and activation barriers are reported in Table 4. In addition, the adsorption
energies for all intermediate states are reported in Table 5. The full energy profiles for
the acetylene hydrogenation mechanism on Pd and AgPd surfaces are
illustrated in Figure 2b. The reaction network starts by the adsorption of the alkyne on
the surface, which is considerably exothermic on Pd(111) by −2.51
while it is slightly exothermic on AgPd by—0.05 eV (with respect
to gas-phase acetylene and H2). Afterward, the sequential
addition of the H atom follows a Horiuti–Polanyi mechanism.25 The first hydrogenation of the adsorbed acetylene
moiety is exothermic and leads to a single product vinyl (HCCH2) on both surfaces. The reaction energies for this step are
−0.17 and −1.26 eV with activation barriers of 0.67
and 0.77 eV on Pd and AgPd, respectively. The second hydrogen addition
can result in two competitive products, ethene (H2CCH2) or ethylidene (HCCH3). The formation of the former
features Ea of 0.66 and 1.36 eV for Pd
and AgPd, respectively, and show an exothermic behavior by −0.31
and −1.52 eV. Because of kinetic reason, ethane formation on
the clean Pd surface is more favored than the formation of ethylidene,
where Ea is 0.72 eV and ΔE is +0.05 eV. While ethylene formation on AgPd is impeded
because the barrier of vinyl hydrogenation to ethylidene (HCCH3) is lower (Ea = 0.92 and ΔE = −0.41). At this stage, the H2CCH2 desorption could eventually undergo over hydrogenation to
ethyl (H2CCH3). The desorption of H2CCH2 is impeded on Pd(111) surface since its energy (0.85
eV) is higher than the third hydrogenation barrier (0.45 eV) whereas
on AgPd surface (Ea = 0.68 eV) it is energetically
advantageous over its further hydrogenation (1.21 eV). The ethyl formation
on both surfaces is exothermic by a reaction energy of −0.20
and −0.24 eV for clean Pd and AgPd surfaces, respectively.
On the other hand, HCCH3 hydrogenation can also lead to
H2CCH3 formation which is exothermic on both
surfaces by −0.54 and −1.35 eV and a barrier of 1.07
and 0.52 eV for Pd and AgPd. The fourth hydrogenation leads to ethane
which is exothermic on both surfaces with a reaction energy (activation
barrier) of −0.67 (0.44) eV on Pd and −1.10 (1.46) eV
on AgPd. The last step is ethane desorption which is easy on the Pd
(0.05 eV) surface while it has a reaction energy of 0.38 eV on the
AgPd surface.

2.3 Dynamic Properties of Intermediates
An important aspect concerns the dynamic properties of hydroperoxide
on the surface. Figure S1 depicts the top
views of the DFT-optimized adsorption configuration of the OOH and
HCCH2 intermediates on different surfaces that we used
for MD calculations. The OOH intermediate fluctuates between the 6
Pd atoms neighboring the Pd–O bond; rotation of this moiety
requires an energy of 0.10 eV on the Pd surface. The fluctuation of
this system on the PdAu surface occurs between the two pairs of Pd
atoms separated by Au atoms (Figure 4a). The barrier for OOH rotation on the PdAu surface
is 0.16 eV which is greater than that on the Pd surface. The Born-Oppenheimer
MD (BOMD) results unveiled that the OOH fluctuation is limited in
a small area on both the Pd and PdAu surface at 300 K (Figure S2). By increasing the temperature to
400 K our results show that OOH has a complete rotation on the bare
Pd surface while no rotation has been seen for this moiety on the
PdAu surface. Figure 4c,d and Movies 1 and 2 illustrate the BOMD results for OOH on clean Pd and PdAu
surfaces. In addition, the OH group rotates also almost freely along
the O–O atom. The potential energy surface for the dynamics
OH group at 300 and 400 K is shown in Figure S3. Both movements effectively lead to the unselective hydrogenation
of OOH or its dissociation over the bare Pd surface because the contact
time with the active Pd site is smaller than any other process, and
thus only the already hydrogenated O in the hydroxyl group can be
attacked by H. In contrast, the nonhydrogenated oxygen of the hydroxyl
group can be attacked by hydrogen atoms over the PdAu surface resulting
in the H2O2 product.

hydroperoxide (O2H) and vinyl
(HCCH2) on the surface: (a) barrier for rotation of the
O2H intermediate on Pd and PdAu surfaces, (b) barrier for
rotation of the HCCH2 on Pd and AgPd surfaces, trajectory
of two oxygen atoms in the O2H intermediate on Pd(c) and
PdAu(d) at 400 K from the BOMD simulation, and trajectory of two carbon
atoms in the HCCH2 intermediate on Pd (e) and AgPd (f)
at 473 K from the BOMD simulation. Color code: oxygen (red cycle),
carbon (black cycle), hydrogen (light grey cycle), Pd (blue cycle),
Au (orange cycle), and Ag (dark yellow cycle).

On the other hand, rotation of the HCCH2 intermediate
requires an energy of 0.26 eV on the Pd surface which is much greater
than the barrier on the AgPd surface (0.025 eV) which means rotation
on the AgPd surface is easier. The energy barrier for HCCH2 fluctuation on Pd and AgPd surfaces is depicted in Figure 4b. The BOMD results revealed
that the HCCH2 fluctuation is limited in a small area between
3 Pd atoms on the clean Pd surface at 473 K while a complete rotation
occurred for this moiety on the AgPd surface (Figure 4e,f and Movies 3 and 4). This movement over the PdAg surface
effectively blocks the selective semihydrogenation to H2CCH2 formation. While on the bare Pd surface, limited
HCCH2 fluctuation leads to the HC head of the HCCH2 molecule to be attacked by H which forms H2CCH2.

3 Conclusions
We have
analyzed the O2 hydrogenation in the direct
synthesis of the water peroxide mechanism on Pd and PdAu surfaces
and the alkyne hydrogenation to alkene over Pd and AgPd surfaces by
means of DFT. Particularly, the energy profiles of hydroperoxide (OOH)
and vinyl (HCCH2) hydrogenation over both bare and alloyed
surfaces were compared to each other. Moreover, BOMD were performed
to study the dynamic aspects of OOH and HCCH2 intermediates
in the selectivity of hydrogenation by heterogeneous catalysts. Our
results show that OOH hydrogenation on the PdAu surface is more exothermic
than that on the clean Pd surface, thereby the PdAu surface should
be more selective than the clean Pd surface for H2O2 formation. On the clean Pd surface, the barrier energy of
side reactions (OOH* dissociation and water formation) is lower than
the formation of H2O2 limiting the selectivity
of the clean Pd surface as a catalyst. The BOMD results confirm that
the OOH intermediate has a complete rotation on the bare Pd surface
while no rotation has been seen for this moiety on the PdAu surface.
Therefore, only the already hydrogenated O in the hydroxyl group can
be attacked by H over the bare Pd surface resulting in water formation.
In contrast, on the PdAu surface the nonhydrogenated oxygen of OOH
can be attacked by hydrogen atoms which lead to the H2O2 product. Likewise, the complete rotation of the HCCH2 intermediate on the AgPd surface effectively blocks the selective
semi-hydrogenation to H2CCH2 formation. This
moiety has limited fluctuation on the bare Pd surface resulting in
higher selectivity toward formation of H2CCH2 in comparison with the AgPd surface. Our results show that intermediate
dynamics control selectivity in hydrogenation by heterogeneous catalysis.

4 Computational Methods
DFT calculations in this study
were performed using the Vienna
Ab initio Simulation Package,26 with the
generalized gradient approximation, and the revised Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof27 functional as exchange–correlation functional
to obtain the energy. Spin-polarized effects were taken into account
for intermediates including oxygen atoms. Monoelectronic valence states
were expanded in plane waves with kinetic cutoff energy of 450 eV,
while core electrons were described with the projected augmented wave
method.28 In all calculations, van der
Waals contributions were described using the semiempirical DFT-D2
approach29,30 and the parameters were reoptimized for
this metal.31 All calculations were performed
on the (111) surfaces as it is the most stable for fcc metals. The
clean Pd and Ag slabs were modeled by a slab consisting of a 3 ×
3 surface unit cell whereas a 4 × 2 surface unit cell was used
to study the hydrogenation reactions on the alloyed slabs (PdAu and
AgPd). In all calculations, each slab contained five atomic layers
(the three at the bottom were fixed and the two on the top were fully
relaxed) and an empty space of 15 Å was introduced in the direction
perpendicular to the surfaces (z-direction), which
ensured that the interaction between the adsorbed molecules and the
periodic images of the slabs is negligible. Sampling of the Brillouin
zones was performed by using the Monkhorst–Pack methodology
with gamma-centered k-point 4 × 4 × 1 and
3 × 6 × 1 grids for the clean and alloyed surfaces, respectively.
The Climbing Image-modified Nudged Elastic Band method32,33 was used to assess the activation energies of the different reaction
paths. The nature of all reaction minima and transition states was
confirmed by means of numerical frequency analyses obtained from the
numerical Hessian calculated with displacements of 0.015 Å. The
PdAu slabs were represented by a substitutional model where only a
0.25 ML of Pd atoms on the surface was replaced by Au atoms. Under
these conditions Au atoms tend to stay on the surface because of the
lower surface energy of Au that provokes segregation of the surface.34 In the AgPd slabs only a 0.125 ML of Ag atoms
on the surface was replaced by Pd atoms.

Standard BOMD were
performed on the same slabs under the NVT ensemble.
BOMD calculations for the OOH intermediate
were performed at 300 and 400 K while the temperature for the CHCH2 intermediate was set to 473 K controlled.35,36 All BOMD runs were performed over 11 ps for OOH and over 20 ps for
CHCH2 using a time step of 1 fs.
