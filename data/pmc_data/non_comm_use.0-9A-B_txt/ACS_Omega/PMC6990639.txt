Ethane
ammoxidation to acetonitrile and ethylene over the Co/HZSM-5
catalysts was revisited based on both transient and steady-state performance
evaluation to elucidate the structure/reactivity relationships. We
suggested that the exchanged Co2+ cation encapsulated in
the zeolite favors the formation of acetonitrile and ethylene, whereas
nanosized cobalt oxide particles without close proximity with the
HZSM-5 only favor CO2 formation. Excess Brønsted acid
sites of the zeolites may act as a reservoir for NH3, which
inhibits the CO2 formation through the NH3-mediated
oxidative dehydrogenation mechanism. According to the transient kinetic
analysis, the time constants τ from the back-transient decay
for NH3 and CO2 are both 7.7 min, which decreased
to 2.7 min for acetonitrile and further decreased to 3–4 s
for ethane, ethylene, and O2. Assuming first-order reaction
kinetics, the rate constants for the formation of acetonitrile and
CO2 are 0.37 and 0.13 min–1, respectively,
from their corresponding reactive intermediates.

1 Introduction
The
current shale gas revolution has revitalized research interests
on the catalytic conversion of light C1–C3 alkanes. While significant attention has been devoted to methane
and propane conversion, a catalytic process for ethane conversion
has been relatively less concerned probably due to the fact that it
is difficult to compete with the well-established steam cracking process
(although it is high carbon and energy-intensive). The catalytic processes
for ethane conversion include oxidative/nonoxidative dehydrogenation
(ODH),1−10 aromatization,11−14 ammoxidation, partial oxidation, reforming, and so forth.15−21 The advantages and disadvantages of these catalytic processes are
summarized in Table 1. In the present paper, we revisited the Co/HZSM-5 catalyzed ethane
ammoxidation because such a catalytic system produces acetonitrile
and ethylene simultaneously with inhibited CO2 formation
(compared to the ODH) because of the presence of NH3.15

The ammoxidation reaction was initially invented in 1959 by Standard
Oil of Ohio (the SOHIO Process) for the production of acrylonitrile
from propylene, NH3, and O2.22 The ethane ammoxidation was then investigated about 20
years later by Aliev and Sokolovskii with a Cr–Sc–Mo–O
catalyst.23 However, the selectivity to
acetonitrile (<30%) was limited because of the formation of CO2 and HCN over such a mixed metal oxide catalyst. It is quite
surprising that the formation of ethylene was not mentioned in the
early study.23 Other mixed metal oxide
catalysts investigated for ethane ammoxidation include Nb–Sb–O/Al2O3,24 V–Mo–Nb–O,25 Ni–Nb–O,26,27 and Mo–V–Te–Nb–O.28 However, the selectivity to acetonitrile over these mixed
oxide catalysts was low (<30%) and the typical propylene and propane
ammoxidation catalyst V–Sb–Al–O seems to be not
effective in the ethane ammoxidation.24

The most effective catalyst for ethane ammoxidation was the
cobalt-modified
zeolites (prepared through an aqueous solution or solid-state ion-exchange)
initially developed by Li and Armor.29−35 The rate of acetonitrile formation over the Co-β catalyst
at 475 °C was 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than the
mixed metal oxide catalysts at 500 °C.29 Li and co-workers then investigated systematically the effect of
zeolite topology, types of metal cations, and the effect of reaction
conditions (temperature and reactants partial pressure) on the catalytic
activity and selectivity, as well as the reaction pathways and mechanism.30−32 Among various zeolite topologies investigated, the Co-modified MFI
(ZSM-5) and BEA (β) catalysts seem to be more effective: ethane
conversion up to 35% and acetonitrile selectivity around 50% was obtained
at 450 °C. Although Co–Y has the highest acetonitrile
selectivity (60%), the conversion of ethane was only 8.4%, which increased
significantly after dealumination treatment.33 Besides the zeolites, Co/silica-alumina and CoO/Al2O3 were also investigated for ethane ammoxidation, which showed
significantly lower activity and selectivity than the Co-ZSM-5 and
Co-β catalysts, indicating the importance of the zeolites framework
structure. Later studies on the effect of acidity further indicated
that the negative charge of the zeolite framework and the accessibility
of the reactants to the exchanged cobalt cations to be the decisive
factors for controlling the activity.36 With respect to the effect of metal cations, Co2+ has
been found to be the most effective one.32 The catalytic activity for other metal cations, such as Ni2+, Fe3+, and Mn2+ was significantly lower than
that of Co2+, whereas the Cu-, Pd-, Ag-, Rh-, and Pt-modified
ZSM-5 catalysts were found to be totally inactive in acetonitrile
formation (produce mainly ethylene and CO2). In terms of
the catalytically active sites, Li and Armor suggested that acetonitrile,
ethylene, and CO2 can all be produced over the exchanged
Co2+ cation; however, the formation of acetonitrile and
ethylene was favored.31

Although
Li and co-workers have carried out extensive studies on
the Co/zeolites catalysts, such a catalytic system has been frequently
revisited recently for both
ethane and ethylene ammoxidation by others for the purpose of further
improving the catalytic performance or understanding the catalytic
mechanism.15,37−43 For example, Essid et al.15 recently
reported that the activity and selectivity of ethane ammoxidation
both improved if [Co(NH3)6]2+ was
impregnated into the BEA zeolite instead of [Co(OH2)6]2+. The improved catalytic performance was attributed
to the formation of Co4N with the presence of NH3 during the activation or impregnation.15

In this work, a series of Co modified HZSM-5 catalysts were
prepared
for ethane ammoxidation through incipient wetness impregnation, ion-exchange,
and physical mixing. The effect of Co loading, SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, and various reaction conditions on the
catalytic performance has been investigated. Specifically, the kinetics
and mechanism of such catalytic systems have been discussed based
on the early-stage reaction transient analysis as well as the back-transient
kinetics. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were extensively
characterized by N2 physisorption, transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), scanning TEM–energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(STEM–EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
(UV–vis-DRS), and NH3- and n-propylamine
temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). The effect of catalyst preparation,
Co loading, and the Si/Al2 ratio of the zeolite host on
the physicochemical properties and their relationships to the catalytic
performance was discussed. We anticipate that a balance between the
function of Co species and the Brønsted acid density of the HZSM-5
is crucial in the ethane ammoxidation.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Catalytic Results
2.1.1 Effect of the Catalyst Preparation
We first did the
blank test of the reactor system, which only produces
a negligible amount of CO2 (∼0.2%). Other products
were not observed during the blank test. While pure HZSM-5 seems to
be active in ethane ammoxidation, the rates of acetonitrile, ethylene,
and CO2 were negligible in comparison to the Co-modified
HZSM-5 catalyst (see Figure S1). The catalytic
performance of ethane ammoxidation over the cobalt-modified HZSM-5
(Si/Al2 = 30) catalysts prepared through ion-exchange,
impregnation, and physical mixing is shown in Figure 1a,b. As we can see, all of the three catalysts
are quite active in ethane ammoxidation for acetonitrile and ethylene.
The cobalt-exchanged HZSM-5 (Co-IE) prepared according to Li and Armor31 shows slightly higher activity (in terms of
ethane conversion) and relatively lower selectivity to acetonitrile
than the catalysts prepared through impregnation (Co-IM-2 wt %). However,
the catalyst prepared through physical mixing (Co-PM-2 wt %) shows
relatively higher CO2 selectivity and lower activity than
the Co-IE and Co-PM-2 wt %. The rates for the formation of acetonitrile,
ethylene, and CO2 are shown in Figure 1b. The Co-PM-2 wt % catalyst clearly shows
a lower rate in terms of acetonitrile and ethylene. We anticipate
that over the Co-PM-2 wt %, the catalytically active sites (exchanged
Co2+ cation) were formed during the activation and ongoing
reaction process through the solid-state ion-exchange (see STEM–EDX
characterization for evidence). Hence, all three catalysts finally
show similar selectivity after reaching the steady state. However,
the Co-PM-2 wt % catalyst takes a longer induction period before reaching
the steady state (see Figure S2), which
also provides evidence for the occurrence of solid-state ion-exchange
during the reaction process. It must be noted that for all of the
catalysts, the NH3 conversion is typically 50%, which is
significantly higher than the ethane conversion (10–20%). Such
different reaction rates regarding NH3 and ethane conversion
suggested that large amounts of NH3 were nonselectively
oxidized into NOx instead of forming acetonitrile
[The mass spectrometer signal of NOx (m/z = 30) was clearly identified, but quantification
of NOx is quite difficult]. The acetonitrile
selectivity based on NH3 is 25–30%, which is similar
to the results reported by Li and Armor.33,34

(c,d), and Co loading (e,f) on the catalytic performance of ethane
ammoxidation. (a,c,e): Selectivity (ethylene, acetonitrile, and CO2) and conversion (C2H6, NH3, and O2); (b,d,f): formation rate of ethylene, acetonitrile,

flow rate 80 mL/min; T = 475 °C, W = 0.2 g.

2.1.2 Effect
of the Si/Al2 Ratio
Using the impregnation method
for catalysts preparation, we then
investigated the effect of the Si/Al2 ratio and Co loading
on the catalytic performance. As shown in Figure 1c, both ethane conversion and acetonitrile
selectivity decrease with the increasing Si/Al2 ratio.
Accordingly, the selectivity to CO2 increases significantly
and ethylene selectivity increases slightly. Specifically, the ethane
conversion was decreased from 18% to almost zero with increasing Si/Al2 ratio from 30 to 80. However, the conversion of NH3 and O2 decreased with increasing Si/Al2 from
30 to 50 and then increased with further increasing Si/Al2 from 50 to 80. In terms of the rates for the formation of acetonitrile,
ethylene, and CO2 (see Figure 1d), they all decreased almost linearly with
the increasing Si/Al2 ratio from 30 to 80 or decreasing
the Brønsted acidities of the zeolite host. Therefore, the acid
properties of the zeolite host are important for such a catalytic
system. According to our recent study,44 the Brønsted acidities of the HZSM-5 with Si/Al2 ratio of 30, 50, and 80 are 531, 387, and 224 μmol/g, respectively.
Because the exchanged Co2+ cation has been considered as
the catalytic active sites for ethane ammoxidation31 and for the zeolite host with a higher Brønsted acid
density, the concentration of the Co2+ active sites should
also be higher. Without sufficient Brønsted acid sites (for high
Si/Al2 ratio zeolite), excessive cobalt species will most
likely form cobalt oxide particles without close proximity with the
zeolite (see STEM–EDX characterization), which will result
in the formation of CO2 and NOx. Consequently, NH3 and O2 conversion further
increased with the increasing Si/Al2 ratio from 50 to 80.

2.1.3 Effect of Co Loading
Because it
has been generally accepted that the exchanged Co2+ cation
is responsible for the ethane ammoxidation,29−35 the effect of Co loading on the HZSM-5 (Si/Al2 = 30)
host was investigated. The Co loading was varied from 0.5 to 10 wt
%, which represents the excess amount of either H+ or Co2+ [assuming bridge-type-exchanged Co2+ cations
(...Al–O–Co–O–Al...)]. As shown in Figure 1e, the acetonitrile
selectivity decreases, CO2 selectivity increases, and ethylene
selectivity remain almost unchanged with increasing Co loading from
0.5 to 10 wt %. The conversion of all three reactants increased almost
linearly with increasing Co loading from 0.5 to 2 wt %. With further
increase of the Co loading from 2 to 10 wt %, the conversion of ethane
and NH3 remain unchanged, but the conversion of O2 further increased. From the involved reaction stoichiometry, such
further increased O2 conversion is likely related to the
increased CO2 selectivity because the conversion of ethane
and NH3 conversion remain unchanged. In terms of the formation
rate of different products, as shown in Figure 1f, the maximum rate for acetonitrile was
obtained at 2 wt % Co loading. When the Co loading was further increased
from 2 to 10 wt %, the rate of acetonitrile decreased; meanwhile,
the rate of CO2 further increased and the rate of ethylene
remains almost unchanged. As already mentioned, excessive cobalt species
will form cobalt oxide particles without close proximity with the
zeolite (see STEM–EDX characterization), which is undesired
for ethane ammoxidation. Therefore, we suggested that 2 wt % be the
optimal Co loading for the ethane ammoxidation. Although for the 2
wt % loading sample Co is deficient compared to the stoichiometric
Co/Al ratio, the excessive Brønsted acid sites could act as a
reservoir for NH3. Actually, if we normalize the rate by
the Co loading instead of the mass of the catalyst, the rates for
all three products decreased continuously with increased Co loading
(see Figure S3), which indicated that the
excessive Brønsted acid sites could have a beneficial effect
to the ammoxidation.

2.2 Catalyst Characterization
The characterization
results of the selected Co-modified HZSM-5 catalysts were measured
by means of N2-physisorption, XRD, XPS, STEM–EDX,
NH3-TPD, and n-propylamine-TPDec. As shown
in Table 2, the physical
properties of the catalysts are clearly influenced by the method of
catalyst preparation and the Co loading. The Co-IE and Co-PM samples
show lower total and microsurface area than the Co-IM samples because
of the partially blocked micropores. Additionally, with increasing
Co loading for the Co-IM samples, the total and microsurface area
and pore volume are also clearly decreased. The XRD patterns (see Figure 2a) of the Co-modified
HZSM-5 catalysts with different Co loadings show almost identical
diffraction patterns for the MFI type of zeolites. The diffraction
of Co species was completely absent for Co loading ≤2 wt %,
indicating very high dispersion of the Co species in the HZSM-5 zeolite.
The Co species underwent significant solid-state ion-exchange during
the high-temperature pretreatment to form the exchanged Co2+ cation.34 When the Co loading ≥5
wt %, the diffraction of Co3O4 (311) was identified
at 2θ of 36.8° (JCPDS no. 42-1467), indicating that nanosize
Co3O4 particles are formed when the Co loading
is higher than the nominal amount (assuming Co/Al = 0.5, the Co loading
for the ion-exchanged sample is 3.1 wt %). Such oxidic Co particles
usually do not have close proximity with the zeolites (see Figure 3i) and could be responsible
for the nonselective ODH and NH3 oxidation to NOx on the high Co-loading catalyst.

and CoOx species, respectively.

The bulk
XRD characterization was further complemented by the results
from XPS surface analyses. The Co 2p spectra of the samples are displayed
in Figure 2b, while
the calculated Co and Al ratios from the spectra are shown in Table 3. There are no apparent
peaks present at the Co 2p spectra for both Co-IE and Co-IM-0.5 wt
%, indicating that the concentration of Co species on the surface
of the zeolite is too low to be detected by the XPS. The peaks start
to emerge for other samples and increases with increasing Co loading.
The Co 2p spectrum of Co-IM-2 wt % contains a peak at ∼782
eV which is usually ascribed to a divalent Co2+. The peak
shifted to ∼780 eV for the Co-IM-5 wt %, indicating the presence
of Co3+,45 which formed the
spinel-type Co3O4 particles as identified by
the XRD. Compared to the fresh catalyst, the Co 2p intensity of the
Co-IM-2 wt % after ethane ammoxidation further attenuates. During
the reaction process, the migration of the Co2+ into the
inner pores of the zeolites is likely happening which prevents the
detection of the Co species by the XPS measurement.

While the Co species
was largely absent from the XPS spectra for
the samples with low Co loading, the presence of Co was clearly observed
from both UV–vis-DRS spectra and the STEM–EDX mapping.
As shown in Figure 3, the UV–vis-DRS spectra clearly show Co(II) ions at wavenumbers
of 12 000–24 000 cm–1 for the
Co-IE and Co-IM (with Co loading ≤ 2 wt %) samples. Additionally,
the peak at 31 000 cm–1, which can be assigned
to the CoOx species, was almost absent
from the UV–vis-DRS spectra, indicating that most of the cobalt
species are coordinated with framework aluminum located in the pores
of zeolites.51 The TEM image and STEM–EDX
chemical mappings of the Co-IM-2 wt % (on HZSM-5 with Si/Al2 = 30) catalyst are shown in Figure 4a–c. A comparison of the Co Kα and Al
Kα mappings of the catalyst both before and after reaction demonstrated
the homogeneous distribution of the cobalt species on the zeolite.
Aggregated CoOx nanoparticles were not
observed from the TEM, which again confirmed the formation of exchanged
Co2+ cations. Different from the catalyst prepared through
impregnation, the Co-PM-2 wt % catalyst after the reaction showed
nanosized particles supported on the HZSM-5 (Figure 4d). Additionally, the occurrence of solid-state
ion-exchange during the activation and reaction process was proved
by the STEM–EDX characterization. As shown in Figure 4f, homogeneously distributed
Co species were clearly identified in the selected region (see Figure 4e), where nanosized
particles are absent. While Co and zeolite in close proximity was
found for both Co-IM and Co-PM with 2 wt % loading on the HZSM-5 with
Si/Al = 30, aggregated Co oxide particles without such proximity was
observed when either the Co loading or the Si/Al2 (of the
zeolite host) is too high because of the off-ratio of the Co/H+. As shown in Figure 4g,h, aggregated Co species without close proximity with the
zeolite were clearly identified for the catalyst with Si/Al2 = 280 (Co loading 2 wt %). The same aggregated Co species were found
for the Co-IM-10 wt % (Si/Al2 = 30) catalyst (see Figure 4i).

The effect of Co loading on the acidity of the catalysts was characterized
by NH3- and n-propylamine-TPD. As shown
in Figure 2c, two distinct
NH3 desorption peaks at 280 and 490 °C are assigned
to NH3 desorbed from weak acid sites and strong acid sites,
respectively. The total acid sites quantified by NH3-TPD
are varied from 381 to 741 μmol/g for different catalysts. With
increasing Co loading, the intensity of the high-temperature peak
decreased, which suggested that the Brønsted acid sites (H+) of the host HZSM-5 were largely replaced by the exchanged
Co2+ cation. Evidence for the decreased Brønsted acid
density can also be found from the n-propylamine-TPD
results (Figure 2-d),
which provide quantitative results of the Brønsted acid concentration.
In such methods, “C3H7NH3+···ZSM-5–” was formed
between propylamine and the Brønsted acid site of the zeolite,
which was decomposed to NH3 and propylene according to
the Hofman-elimination type of mechanism at ∼400 °C.46−49 In our previous paper,44 the desorption
of NH3 was employed to quantify the Brønsted acid
sites because of the secondary reaction of the propylene. However,
over the present Co-modified HZSM-5 catalyst (not a typical catalyst
for aromatization), the formation of secondary products from propylene
was insignificant. Therefore, propylene desorption during the propylamine-TPD
was employed for quantification as suggested by the literature.46 The Brønsted acid density of the catalysts
was quantified to be 381.7 μmol/gcat for Co-IM-0.5
wt % and decreased to 221.6 μmol/gcat for the Co-IM-10
wt % catalyst. The Brønsted acid sites only slightly decreased
when the Co/Al ratio exceeds significantly the stoichiometric ratio
for ion-exchange, indicating that part of the Brønsted acid sites
(most probably the sinusoidal channels) is inaccessible for solid-state
ion-exchange.

2.3 Transient Kinetics Analysis
and Mechanism
Relaxation-type transient kinetic analysis
provides important information
about how the steady-state reaction was reached upon introducing perturbation,
which was realized by fast partial pressure step changes for the reactor
influent gases in the present study. During the early-stage transient,
the reactor flux was changed abruptly from Ar to the reactant mixture.
Information about how a clean surface catalyst reaches the steady-state
ammoxidation was obtained. The results over the optimal Co-IM-2 wt
% catalyst are shown in Figure 5a. The normalized (with respect to the steady-state outlet
molar flow rate) outlet flow of reactants and products take about
2 min to reach 1, which means the ethane ammoxidation over such catalysts
takes 2 min to reach the steady state. The reactants ethane and O2 appear almost immediately in the outflow gas phase and reach
the maximum at 0.3 min after switching from Ar to the reactant mixture.
Ammonia, however, appears in the gas phase with clear delay (0.25
min) and it takes about 2 min to reach the maximum. Significant delay
of NH3 with respect to ethane and O2, indicating
the strong chemisorption of NH3 on the (Lewis and Brønsted)
acid sites of the catalyst. Additionally, ethane and O2 reach a maximum that exceeds their steady-state level at 0.2–0.5
min, which is most probably because of the increase of partial pressure
caused by the consumption of NH3 through chemisorption.
The O2 then decreased to below steady-state when acetonitrile
was largely produced. Such early-stage features of delay were totally
absent during the blank test (see Figure S4a,b), in which the influence of the reactor system on the delay can
be excluded. Additionally, delay of NH3 over the HZSM-5
sample (without Co function) is similar to the Co/HZSM-5 catalysts,
indicating that the initial delay of NH3 (∼0.25
min) mainly originated from the chemisorption on the acid sites of
the zeolite.

In terms of product formation,
ethylene and CO2 were
produced simultaneously when ethane appeared in the gas phase. Both
reached a maximum at 5 s and decreased immediately to a minimum after
20–30 s. They both take about 1 min to reach the steady-state
level. The peaks of ethylene and CO2 showed up before the
full appearance of NH3 in the gas phase, which suggested
that the clean catalyst surface without NH3 is active for
ethane ODH to ethylene (mainly produces CO2 rather than
ethylene). Such a nonselective ODH mechanism was replaced by NH3-mediated ODH (ammoxidation) when the catalytical active sites
were occupied by NH3. Different from the production of
ethylene and CO2, ammoxidation involves two different mechanisms
during the early-stage run-in period: the formation of acetonitrile
dependent exclusively upon the chemisorption of NH3 on
the catalytic active sites. Ethylene and CO2 appear immediately
in the gas based on the nonselective ODH mechanism, whereas the formation
of acetonitrile was delayed (the same as NH3) because it
requires building a catalytically active surface through NH3 pre-chemisorption. The production of acetonitrile reaches the steady-state
at 1.5 min. Quite similar features of delay on acetonitrile and NH3 were also observed for the Co-IE and Co-PM-2 wt % catalysts
(see Figure S5b,d). However, the delay
of O2, as well as the quantitative information of such
early-stage features for different reactants and products, seem to
be affected by the catalyst preparation.

The back-transient
kinetics was initiated by changing the reactor
flux from the reactant mixture back to the inert gas (Ar). Kinetics
information about the reactivity of the chemisorbed intermediates
(on the catalyst surface) can be obtained from the time constants
of the product decay. Assuming first-order reaction kinetics on single-type
catalytically active sites, the rate for the formation of final products
during the extended back-transient can be expressed as ln(ratetransient) = ln(ratesteady-state) – t/τ (or ln(ratetransient) = ln(ratesteady-state) – kt). Details
about the derivation of such a linear equation can be found in our
previous paper.50 The entire back-transient
behavior of the normalized outlet flow for both reactants and products
is shown in Figure 5b. The time constant τ for the decay of NH3 and
CO2 is 7.7 min, which decreased to 2.7 min for acetonitrile
and further decreased to only 3–4 s for ethane, ethylene, and
O2. The time constant(3–4 s) is close to the reactor
response of the inert gas (2 s) and the response of the blank test
(see Figure S4a). During the entire back-transient
process, the first few minutes after removal of reactants were considered
as the near steady-state behavior (see Figure 5c). It takes only about a few seconds for
the complete decay of O2, while the decay of ethane and
ethylene take slightly longer than that for O2. They all
disappeared from the gas phase within about 10 s, which is similar
to the time required for the complete appearance of Ar in the gas
phase. Therefore, we suggested that the chemisorbed surface intermediates
do not lead to the formation of ethylene in the absence of gas-phase
ethane and NH3. Additionally, ethane and O2 either
chemisorbed weakly (completes poorly with NH3) on the catalyst
or the chemisorbed ethane and O2 converted immediately
to another type of intermediates (presumably the most abundant reactive
intermediates or MARI). The decay of acetonitrile, CO2,
and NH3 requires a longer time than that for ethane and
ethylene. The rate constant for the formation of acetonitrile and
CO2 is 0.37 and 0.13 min–1, respectively,
(see Figure 5d) from
their corresponding reactive intermediates. A strict linear relation
between ln(ratetransient) and time during the extended
back-transient indicates that such reactions follow the first-order
kinetics. The near steady-state back-transient also shows a sudden
decay of acetonitrile, NH3, and CO2 within the
initial 30 s, which then level-off for various time periods before
the final first-order decay. Such unique behavior is most probably
because of the formation of two different types of catalytically active
sites, presumably Co oxide particles located on the external surface
of the HZSM-5 zeolite and exchanged Co2+ cations inside
the pores of the zeolite. Additionally, the time constant for the
decay of NH3, CO2, and acetonitrile over the
Co-IE and Co-PM-2 wt % catalysts (see Figure S5a,c) was quite similar to that over the optimal Co-IM-2 wt % catalyst,
indicating that the same type of reactive intermediates and catalytically
active sites are involved. It must be noted that the decay of CO2 over the HZSM-5 sample (Figure S4c) is significantly faster than that over the Co-modified HZSM-5 catalysts
(note that the activity of the HZSM-5 sample is very low in ethane
ammoxidation, see Figure S1), indicating
the formation of CO2-related species (probably formates
or carbonates) on the Co sites.

In terms of the reaction pathways
and mechanism, we suggested that
ammonia mediated the initial step ethane ODH. The C–N bond
was formed immediately after the initial C–H bond activation,
which acts as an intermediate for acetonitrile. Meanwhile, such an
intermediate can also be decomposed into ethylene and NHx, which might be partially oxidized into CO2 and NOx, respectively. The overall kinetic
expression for the rate of acetonitrile has been proposed by Li and
Armor.31 They suggested that the formation
of the C–N bond between ethylene and chemisorbed NH3 on the Co–OH sites could produce the ethylamine-type intermediate,
whereas the formation of ethylene from ethane ODH was proposed on
a clean Co–OH site in the absence of NH3, which
is less likely under the ammoxidation conditions because NH3 terminates such chemisorption on Lewis acid Co sites. Li and Armor
also proposed the formation of N2 from the ethylamine-type
intermediate with an additional chemisorbed NH3. However,
the formation of NOx, which was clearly
observed from our study, was not considered. With respect to the catalytic
active sites, Li and Armor suggested that the exchanged Co2+ cations to be responsible for the formation of all products from
ethane ammoxidation. We anticipate that CO2 may originate
from the ethylene oxidation, and such a reaction was particularly
favored because of the presence of the Co nanoparticles without close
proximity with the zeolites. The efficient formation of acetonitrile
may also be related to the remaining Brønsted acid sites of the
zeolite host, which could provide protonated NH4+ in the first step, followed by the formation of “C2H5NH3+···ZSM-5–” (as the reactive intermediate) through a mechanism
similar to the reverse Hofman-elimination. Therefore, supported by
our catalytic results, we suggested that a proper balance between
the exchanged Co2+ cations and the Brønsted acidity
density would adjust and optimize the activity/selectivity to acetonitrile
in this catalytic system.

3 Conclusions
While the cobalt-modified HZSM-5 catalyst has been extensively
studied for the ethane ammoxidation since the later 1990s, more detailed
discussion about the structure/performance relationships and the kinetics
of the reaction mechanism has been less concerned. We present here
our understanding of these questions based on the performance of the
catalyst with tuned metal/acid functions. Such steady-state catalytic
performance was complemented with the early-stage transient analysis
and the back-transient kinetics of the product decay study. We identified
that the catalyst prepared through simple impregnation shows similar
catalytic performance with that prepared through the ion-exchange
method. The same type of the active site, namely, the exchanged Co2+ cation was formed by two preparation methods after activation.
The catalyst prepared through physical mixing also leads to the formation
of exchanged Co2+ sites (with the co-presence of nanosized
Co oxide particles), showing similar product selectivity. The effect
of the Si/Al2 ratio and Co loading on the activity and
selectivity suggested that excess Co amounts or deficient Brønsted
acid sites density resulted in the formation of CO2 rather
than acetonitrile and ethylene, which most probably due to the formation
of aggregated cobalt oxide particles as identified by the STEM–EDX,
XRD, XPS, and UV–vis-DRS. We suggested that the excess Brønsted
acid sites of the zeolites might act as a reservoir for NH3, which promotes the formation of acetonitrile while inhibiting the
CO2 formation. The early-stage catalytic behavior during
the transient kinetic analysis indicated that NH3 mediated
the initial ODH of ethane. Ammonia and acetonitrile appear in the
product stream simultaneously before building the NH3 reservoir,
whereas CO2 was mainly produced. According to the back-transient
kinetic analysis, the decay of NH3 and CO2 shows
the same large time constant τ at 7.7 min, indicating that the
presence of NH3 strongly reduced the rate of CO2 formation from its intermediate precursor. The time constant for
acetonitrile was decreased to 2.7 min and further decreased to only
3–4 s for ethane, ethylene, and O2. Finally, the
kinetics from the back-transient analysis suggested the first-order
reactions for the formation of acetonitrile and CO2 from
their corresponding reactive intermediates. Their rate constants are
0.37 and 0.13 min–1, respectively.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Catalyst Preparation
Co/HZSM-5 with
different Co loadings was prepared through incipient wetness impregnation.
The NH4-ZSM-5 zeolites were purchased from VWR International
(SBET ≈ 400 m2/g). Before
impregnation, the NH4-ZSM-5 zeolites were converted into
proton-type through calcination at 550 °C under air for 6 h.
For a typical impregnation process, 6 mL of an aqueous solution of
cobalt nitrate (Sigma-Aldrich) was added dropwise to the calcined
HZSM-5 (3 g). The obtained sample was kept in air for 12 h at 60 °C.
Finally, the sample was calcined under flow of air in a muffle furnace
at 560 °C for 4 h. The obtained samples were named as Co-IM #
wt %, where the # represents the nominal metal-based Co loading. The
obtained powder samples were pressed into pellets and sieved to obtain
a particle size of 20–45 mesh for characterization and catalytic
performance tests.

For the purpose of comparison, Co-modified
HZSM-5 catalysts were also prepared through ion-exchange (named as
Co-IE) and physical mixing (named as Co-PM). For ion-exchange, 3 g
of NH4-ZSM-5 zeolite was exchanged with 0.05 M cobalt nitrate
aqueous solution at 80 °C for 6 h and repeated three times. The
obtained slurry was centrifuged and washed with distilled water three
times. For physical mixing, 0.534 g of cobalt nitrate was mixed with
3 g NH4-ZSM-5 using a Fritsch Pulverisette ball mill for
5 min. The obtained sample was finally dried and calcined according
to the same procedure described above.

4.2 Catalyst
Characterization
Nitrogen
adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured at −195.8 °C
on a TriStar II 3020 gas adsorption analyzer of Micromeritics. Prior
to the measurement, the sample was degassed under high vacuum at 300
°C for 8 h. The total surface area was calculated from the adsorption
branch in the range of relative pressure from 0.05 to 0.25 by the
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, whereas the total
pore volume was estimated at a nitrogen relative pressure of 0.99.
The micropore volume and external surface area were calculated from
the isotherms by the t-plot method; the micropore
surface area was obtained from the difference between the total surface
area and external surface area.

Ammonia-TPD and n-propylamine-TPD experiments were performed in a quartz reactor with
a volume of 2 mL (ID, Φ = 1/2 in). Prior to NH3 and n-propylamine adsorption, the catalysts (0.1 g for NH3-TPD and 0.06 g for C3H7NH2-TPD) were pretreated in Ar at 650 °C for 20 min. Adsorption
of NH3 or n-propylamine was carried out
at 120 °C under pure NH3 for 30 min or through pulsing n-propylamine injection until saturation, respectively.
For both experiments, the samples after pre-adsorption were flushed
with Ar (at 120 °C for NH3 and 200 °C for n-propylamine) for 2 h to remove the physically adsorbed
NH3 and n-propylamine. Finally, the temperature
of the sample was increased to 620 °C at a ramp of 10 °C/min
under the flow of Ar at 20 mL/min. Desorption of NH3 (m/z = 17) was measured during the NH3-TPD by an online mass spectrometer (Agilent 5973). In the
C3H7NH2-TPDec experiment, the desorption
signals of NH3 (m/z =
17), C3H6 (m/z = 41), benzene (m/z = 78), toluene
(m/z = 92), and xylene (m/z = 106) were measured with the same
mass spectrometer. More detailed experimental procedures for NH3- and n-propylamine-TPD have been described
in our previous work.44

The solid-phase
composition prepared by different methods and various
cobalt loading percentages was identified by X-ray powder diffraction
with a scanning rate of 4° min–1 in the range
of 2θ from 4 to 50°. The purity and crystallinity of zeolites
of the sample obtained by pressing the powder into schistose were
measured by the X-ray diffractometer on the Rigaku Ultima III XRD
system with Cu Kα radiation (154.06 pm, 40 kV, and 44 mA).

TEM/STEM–EDX characterization of the sample was performed
on a JEOL 2100TEM (accelerating voltage 200 kV) equipped with a Gatan
camera.

The surface chemistry and composition of the catalysts
were measured
using a PHI Quantum 2000 XPS. The samples were crushed and pressed
into indium metal foils, which were then mounted on the XPS sample
holders. A monochromated Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) at an operating
power of 18 kV was used for the analysis. The core-level spectra were
monitored by employing a pass energy of 23 eV for the high-resolution
scans (except for trace elements) and 188 eV for the survey scans.
The C 1s line at 284.8 eV of adventitious carbon was taken as an energy
reference to compensate for surface-charging effects. The spectra
obtained were processed and analyzed using the CasaXPS software.

The ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis-DRS)
were collected on a Cary 5000 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer
(Agilent) equipped with a diffuse reflectance attachment with a polytetrafluoroethylene
integrating sphere. Before each measurement, the hydrated Co-ZSM-5
samples were transformed to their dehydrated form under 10–1 Pa and 400 °C for 7 h, which were then transferred into a sample
cell in a glovebox (O2 < 0.1 ppm; H2O <
0.1 ppm). Operated at a scan speed of 10 nm s–1,
a step length of 1 nm, and a slim width of 5 nm, the UV–vis-DRS
were collected in a differential mode referenced to their parent H-ZSM-5
zeolites.

4.3 Catalytic Testing
The ammoxidation
of ethane was conducted in a home-made U-shape quartz reactor equipped
with an on-line Agilent 5973 mass spectrometer. The manifold reactor
setup has two parallel gas lines, switched by a four-way valve, connecting
to the reactor. The reactor influent gas can be abruptly switched
from inert (Ar) to the reactant mixture (C2H6/NH3/O2) and vice versa, which provides the
dynamic information for both the early-stage transient period and
the back-transient reaction fade away.50 Typically, 0.2 g of the catalyst was loaded in the reactor and pretreated
in Ar (20 mL/min) at 650 °C (ramp 10 °C/min) for 20 min
to remove the impurities adsorbed on the catalyst. The temperature
of the reactor was then cooled to 475 °C for the reaction. Prior
to each experiment, bypass feed spectra were recorded for mass spectrometer
calibration and used as a reference for activity calculation. Finally,
the reaction was initiated abruptly by switching the influent gas
from Ar to the reactant mixture (10% C2H6, 10%
NH3, and 6.4% O2, balance with Ar) at a total
flow of 80 mL/min. The corresponding gas hourly space velocity is
32 000 h–1. All of the connection gas lines
between the reactor and mass spectrometry were heated to 150 °C
to avoid the condensation of acetonitrile and water.
