Zinc(II)-catalyzed
(10 mol % ZnCl2) coupling of acyl
hydrazides and dialkylcyanamides in ethanol leads to 3-dialkylamino-1,2,4-triazoles
(76–99%; 17 examples). This reaction represents a novel, straightforward,
and high-yielding approach to practically important 3-NR2-1,2,4-triazoles, which utilizes commercially available and/or easily
generated substrates. Seventeen new 3-NR2-1,2,4-triazoles
were characterized by HRESI+-MS and IR, 1H,
and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopies and five species
additionally by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD). The ZnII-catalyzed reaction proceeds via initial generation of the
[Zn{RC(=O)NHNH2}3](ZnCl4) complexes (exemplified
by isolation of the complex with R = Ph, 76%; characterized by HRESI+-MS, IR, CP-MAS TOSS 13C{1H} NMR, and
XRD). Electronic effects of substituents at the acyl hydrazide moiety
do not significantly affect the reaction rate and the yield of the
target triazoles, whereas the steric hindrances reduce the reaction
rate without affecting the yield of the heterocycles.

1 Introduction
1,2,4-Triazole and its derivatives represent an important class
of five-membered heterocycles, and many aspects of their versatile
organic1,2 and coordination3,4 chemistry
have been repeatedly reviewed over the years. The increased number
of publication on 1,2,4-triazoles relates to the extensive application
of these heterocycles, their derivatives, and (1,2,4-triazole)-based
metal complexes in materials chemistry5−9 and also in medicinal chemistry insofar as these species display
broad spectrum of biological activities (for recent reviews see refs10−12).

3-Amino-1,2,4-triazoles comprise a subclass of 1,2,4-triazoles,
and these amino species are widely used in materials chemistry (as
gas adsorbents and separators,13−18 luminescent materials,19 proton conductive
nanotubes,20 corrosion inhibitors,21−23 polymer modifiers,24,25 precursors for carbon nitride
derivatives,26 and components of energetic
materials27,28), in medicinal chemistry,29−31 or in synthetic
chemistry as synthons for generation of other heterocyclic systems.32−38

3-Amino-1,2,4-triazoles are typically generated via four routes
(Scheme 1, a–d). The first method involves
the reaction of acyl hydrazides with isothioureas (typically generated
via S-alkylation of thiourea in a separate synthesis) in the presence
of a base (in H2O, RT, 1–3 d; 54–58%; a)39,40 to furnish N-unsubstituted 3-amino-1,2,4-triazoles.
Another method is based on the reaction of hydrazine with N-acylisothioureas (refluxing EtOH, 0.5–3.5 h; 52–96%; b).41−43 However, N-acylisothioureas are
typically generated via multistep methodologies41 and when the reaction is performed starting from commercially
available reagents, the yield of the target aminotriazoles is significantly
lower (by ca. 35%).41 It is noteworthy
that the method suggested in refs41,43 allows
the synthesis of 3-substituted-1,2,4-triazoles bearing only 1-indolinyl-
or dialkylamino substituents as the NR2 group.

Scheme 1 Known Synthetic
Methodologies of Generation of 5-Amino-1,2,4-triazoles
Yet another route includes the reaction of acyl
hydrazides with
cyanamides strongly activated by electron-withdrawing groups (in dioxane
or DMF, reflux, 3–12 h; 30–76%; c).44−48 This heterocyclization was successful only for monosubstituted cyanamides
with electron-withdrawing substituents, for example, EWG = +C(NH2)2, C(=O)Ar, or 2-(4,6-dimethylpyrimidyl).
Yet another method, the fourth route, includes a copper(I)/O2-mediated oxidative coupling of N,N-dimethylguanidine with benzonitrile (in Me2SO, 120 °C,
1 d; 66%; d) giving 3-dimethylamino-5-phenyl-1,2,4-triazole.49 Other nitriles were not tested in this reaction
that was conducted, however, with N,N-dimethylguanidine or other guanidines.

The routes employing
isothioureas give 3-R-1,2,4-triazoles
with both donor and acceptor substituents R, but they require utilization
of isothioureas that are typically available from separate multistep
synthetic methodologies. The third and fourth methods considered above
are characterized by moderate yields and were performed for cyanides
featuring exclusively activating acceptor substituents. Thus, as can
be inferred from the consideration of the reported methods, a convenient
and high-yielding synthetic method leading to 3-amino-1,2,4-triazoles
is not yet developed.

In view of our general interest in reactions
of metal-activated
substrates featuring CN triple bonds (for our reviews see refs (50) and (51)) and, in particular, synthetic
approaches allowing facile transformations of rather unreactive cyanamides
(reviews;52,53 recent studies, see refs54−56), we decided to study a possibility of ZnII-catalyzed
synthesis of 3-NAlk2-1,2,4-triazoles from acyl hydrazides
and dialkylcyanamides. Usage of zinc(II), apart from the low cost
and rather environmentally friendly character of this metal center,
was additionally stimulated by its recent applications in advanced
organic synthesis57−65 and by our own studies disclosing a detailed mechanism of ZnII/H+-mediated generation of 5-amino-1,2,4-oxadiazoles
via amidoxime–cyanamide coupling.66

This work describes a new synthetic procedure based on zinc(II)-catalyzed
acyl hydrazide–dialkylcyanamide coupling, which allows the
utilization of cyanamides bearing donor alkyl substituents and gives
3-dialkylamino-1,2,4-triazoles under mild conditions and in high yields.
We also established that the ZnII-catalyzed reaction proceeds
via initial generation of the [Zn{RC(=O)NHNH2}3](ZnCl4) complexes and all our data are consistently disclosed in paragraphs
that follow.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 ZnII-Involving Acyl Hydrazide–Dialkylcyanamide
Coupling
To start our study, we attempted the acyl hydrazide–dialkylcyanamide
coupling under conditions similar to those employed for the preparation
of 5-amino-1,2,4-oxadiazoles from amidoximes and cyanamides.66 Our experiments indicated initial generation
of [Zn{PhC(=O)NHNH2}3](ZnCl4) (32% based on PhC(O)NHNH2) at RT for 5 min in the reaction mixture containing ZnCl2 and PhC(O)NHNH2 (1 equiv) in EtOAc. Further optimization
of the reaction conditions led to [Zn{PhC(=O)NHNH2}3](ZnCl4) (76%) generated by the reaction between ZnCl2 and benzoyl
hydrazide (1.5 equiv) in dioxane for 5 min at RT (Scheme 2, a). Noticeably,
this complex was repeatedly formed from 1:1 to 1:3 molar ratios of
ZnCl2 and PhC(O)NHNH2, respectively, and no
other zinc(II) containing species were isolated from the reaction
mixtures.

Scheme 2 Zinc(II)-Mediated Benzoyl Hydrazide–Dimethylcyanamide
Coupling
Complex 1 reacted with Me2NCN (3.6 equiv)
in EtOH solution at 80 °C for 6 h giving triazole 2 in 98% isolated yield (85% after 4 h; Scheme 2, b). All these initial
experiments demonstrated that the coupling between acyl hydrazides
and dialkylcyanamide can be conducted under ZnII-involving
conditions to give practically important 3-NR2-1,2,4-triazoles.
Owing to the known kinetic lability of zinc(II) centers, we further
decided to study a possibility of generation of these heterocyclic
systems via a more sustainable zinc(II)-catalyzed route, and the corresponding
experiments are described in the next section.

2.2 ZnII-Catalyzed Acyl Hydrazide–Dialkylcyanamide
Coupling
To begin optimization, benzoyl hydrazide and dimethylcyanamide
were chosen as model substrates (Table 1). First, methanol, ethanol, and 1,4-dioxane were taken
as reaction media because of good solubility of all reaction components
in these solvents. In blank experiments conducted in the absence of
any catalyst, only trace amounts of the triazole were detected by
HRESI+-MS (entries 1–3). We started catalyst screening
from the cheap and broadly available ZnCl2. In the presence
of ZnCl2 (10 mol %; for the catalyst optimization see later),
the reaction was performed in ethanol and 1,4-dioxane for 18 h upon
reflux to give the triazole in nearly quantitative 1H NMR
yields (entries 6 and 7), whereas in methanol the yield was 51% (entry
4). This moderate yield of the product in MeOH is probably due to
lower reflux temperature of the reaction mixture and, indeed, the
yield increased by 35% on heating the reaction mixture for additional
18 h (entry 5). Considering these data, ethanol was chosen as a solvent
for the reaction as more suitable (less toxic and dangerous and inexpensive)
than 1,4-dioxane.

in parentheses.

c 1H NMR yield was not
determined because the catalyst is paramagnetic; full conversion was
established by TLC.

Further
step of optimization was screening reaction catalysts (entries
8–13). Zinc(II) bromide appears to be less suitable catalyst
for this reaction (entry 8) than ZnCl2, whereas Zn(OTf)2 gave the triazole also in quantitative yield (entry 9). However,
zinc(II) triflate is more expensive than the chloride. Some other
late 3d-metal chlorides, viz. CuCl2, CoCl2,
NiCl2, and FeCl3, gave triazoles in substantially
lower yields than those with ZnCl2 because of unselective
generation of various unidentified species (entries 10–13).
Thus, ZnCl2 was chosen for further optimization. This included
variation of reaction time and also change of relative quantity of
ZnCl2 and dimethylcyanamide.

Monitoring of the reaction
indicated that the reaction in refluxing
ethanol takes 6 h (entries 14–16) to give the target compound
in 96% isolated yield. Because of that, further optimization was performed
by heating for 6 h. Variation of the relative quantity of ZnCl2 indicated that the decrease of the catalyst amount results
in decreased yield of the triazole (entries 17–18), whereas
the increase of the catalyst amount to 15 mol % does not affect conversion
and preparative yield of the triazole within experimental error (entry
19). Hence, 10 mol % of ZnCl2 was applied in further experiments.
Variation of the relative quantity of dimethylcyanamide (from 1:1
to 1:2 molar ratios) indicated that 1.2 equiv of the cyanamide is
an optimal quantity; increase of the relative quantity of Me2NCN complicates the isolation and leads to lower isolated yield of
the triazole (entries 20–22). On the basis of our experimental
data, the reaction of acyl hydrazide with 1.2 equiv of dialkylcyanamide
in the presence of ZnCl2 (10 mol %) in ethanol for 6 h
upon reflux was chosen as basic reaction conditions for further syntheses.

After the optimization, the substrate scope of acyl hydrazides
was studied (Scheme 3). In general, this reaction proceeds smoothly for 6 h to furnish 2–14 in good-to-excellent yields. Slightly lower isolated
yield (76%; compare with 91% 1H NMR yield) for 4 is probably because of rather good solubility of 4 in
Et2O, which causes a loss of the triazole on purification.
Steric hindrances have a negligible effect on reaction yields but
significantly affect the reaction time; it takes 24 h to reach full
conversion of the acyl hydrazide for ortho-substituted triazoles 11 and 12. Longer reaction time was also required
for the synthesis of 7, 8, and 13, and it is probably because of the heterogeneity of the reaction
mixture.

Scheme 3 Substrate Scope of Acyl Hydrazides and N,N-Disubstituted Cyanamides
Compounds characterized by single-crystal
XRD are given in red.

Next, we varied dialkylcyanamides
as the reaction partners (Scheme 3). The reaction proceeds
for dialkylcyanamides giving 15–18 in good-to-excellent
yields (76–99%). The developed procedure was applied for the
synthesis of 17 new 3-NAlk2-1,2,4-triazoles that were characterized
by HRESI+-MS and IR, 1H, and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopies and five compounds also by X-ray crystallography.

This synthetic protocol cannot be recommended as a route to unsubstituted
and monosubstituted 3-amino-1,2,4-triazoles. The coupling involving
the unsubstituted cyanamide NCNH2 gives only a trace amount
of 3-NH2-5-Ph-1,2,4-triazole (detected by HRESI+-MS) after 24 h, whereas the major product, as expected,67,68 is cyanoguanidine (76%). Utilization of the monosubstituted cyanamides
NCN(H)C6H4R-4 (R = MeO, H, Cl) gives the corresponding
triazoles only in 20, 9, and 12% 1H NMR yields, respectively,
and their appearance is accompanied with generation of many unidentified
species. The reaction utilizing N,N-diphenylcyanamide gives the corresponding 3-NPh2-1,2,4-triazole
(ca. 50% 1H NMR yield) along with a mixture of unidentified
products; all our attempts of their separation failed. Variation of
the catalyst amount from 5 to 20 mol % and reaction time from 1 to
24 h did not improve the selectivity. Thus, preparation of the diarylamino
triazoles requires another synthetic methodology. The reported protocol
is not applicable for the reaction of acyl hydrazides with conventional
aromatic and aliphatic nitriles, because the application of these
RCN’s give only trace amounts of the corresponding triazoles
(detected by HRESI-MS) even after 2 d.

2.3 Analytical
and Spectroscopy Data
Compound 1 was characterized
by inductively coupled
plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES)-based Zn elemental analysis,
molar conductivity, HRESI+-MS, IR, and CP-MAS TOSS 13C{1H} NMR and additionally by single-crystal X-ray
diffraction (Figure 1). It gives satisfactory ICP-AES-based Zn elemental analysis for
the proposed formula. Molar conductivity is 15.7 S cm2 mol–1 in EtOH, which is lower than that expected for 1:1
electrolytes (35–45 S cm2 mol–1),69 most likely because of a dynamic
equilibrium with nonionic complexes, for example, [ZnCl2{PhC(=O)NHNH2}n] (n = 1 or 2). The HRESI+ mass-spectrum of 1 exhibits a peak corresponding to the quasi-ions [M + Cl
– L]+. The IR spectrum displays strong bands at
3240–3155 cm–1 from ν(N–H).
Medium intensity bands at 3056–2855 cm–1 were
assigned to the ν(C–H) vibrations. The spectra exhibit
very strong bands at 1637 and 1609 cm–1 from ν(C=O)
and ν(C=N). The CP-MAS TOSS 13C{1H} NMR spectrum displays two sets of signals. One signal in the region
of δ 170.56 corresponds to the carbonyl group C atom, whereas
another group of signals is from the aromatic system (δ 139.18–122.41).

scheme. Thermal ellipsoids are given at the 50% level.

In the molecular structure of 1·H2O, the coordination polyhedron of the zinc(II) center in the
anionic
species displays tetrahedral geometry, and Zn–Cl distances
[2.232(2)–2.329(3) Å] are typical for the Zn–Cl
bonds.70 In the cation, the coordination
polyhedron exhibits a typical octahedral geometry with fac-configuration
of the ligands (Figure 1). All bond angles around the zinc(II) centers range from 77.0(2)
to 99.0(3)°, the Zn–O [2.068(6)–2.122(6) Å]
and Zn–N [2.163(7)–2.180(8) Å] are normal single
bonds.70 In the ligands, the N(1)–N(2)
distances [1.398(9)–1.418(10) Å] are usual single bonds,
whereas the O(1)–C(2) [1.235(10)–1.252(10) Å] and
N(2)–C(1) [1.328(11)–1.339(11) Å] bonds have a
transitive order between single and double bonds, which indicates
an extensive electron delocalization.71

Triazoles 2–18 were unknown before this
work
and they were characterized by HRESI+-MS, IR, 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopies. In addition, 2, 6, 9, 13, and 16 were studied by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Figures 2 and 74S–78S). Compound 3 was
isolated and characterized as a stable solvate 3·2/3EtOAc.
The HRESI+ mass-spectra of 2–18 exhibit
a set of peaks corresponding to the quasi-ions [M + H]+, and 2, 3, 5, 6, and 18 in addition display peaks corresponding to
the quasi-ions [M + H + H2O]+. The IR spectra
of 2–18 display one weak-to-medium band in the
range of 3463–3137 cm–1, which was attributed
to the N–H stretches. Medium intensity bands at 3163–2712
cm–1 were assigned to the ν(C–H) vibrations.
The spectra exhibit very strong band at 1632–1568 cm–1 from ν(C=N). The spectrum of 3·2/3EtOAc
additionally exhibits one strong band at 1610 cm–1 from ν(C=O) of ethyl acetate. In addition, the IR spectrums
of 8 and 14 display two strong bands at
1152–2519 and 1345–1334 cm–1 assignable
to asymmetric and symmetric valence stretches of NO2,25 respectively. The 1H NMR spectra
of 2, 3·2/3EtOAc, and 4–18 recorded in (CD3)2SO display two sets of signals
corresponding to the two tautomeric forms. In particular, two broad
singlets from the NH were observed at δ 13.59–12.81 and
12.76–12.13. The spectra of dimethylamino triazoles 3·2/3EtOAc, 2, and 4–18 display
one singlet signal at δ 2.99–2.86 from NMe2, whereas the spectrum of 15 exhibit quartet and triplet
at δ 3.41 and 1.13, respectively, which were attributed to the
NEt2 resonances. In accord with the 1H NMR data,
the 13C{1H} NMR spectra of 2, 3·2/3EtOAc, and 4–18 also display
two sets of signals. Two signals in the region of δ 160.79–157.01
correspond to the quaternary C atoms of the 1,2,4-triazole ring. The
spectra of 2, 9, 13, 14, 17, and 18 also exhibit additional
two signals corresponding to the minor tautomer, which were observed
at δ 167.49–166.72 and 154.64–153.18. For 2, 3·2/3EtOAc, and 4–18 the signals of aromatic systems are located in the typical region
of δ 159.21–115.15. The spectra of 2, 3·2/3EtOAc, and 4–18 also exhibit
a signal in the δ 38.88–38.72 range, which is attributed
to NMe2. Only one tautomeric form was observed in the 1H NMR spectra of 5 and 12 recorded
in less polar (CD3)2CO, but poor solubility
of 2, 3·2/3EtOAc and 4–18 in (CD3)2CO does not allow to obtain high
quality spectra even at high acquisition time. In addition, availability
of two set of signals in the spectra due to a partial dimerization
of the compounds was ruled out, because of relative integral intensities
of the two forms during 10-fold dilution of the compound were intact
(experiment was performed in (CD3)2SO for 13; see Figures 50S and 52S).

structure of 2 showing the atomic numbering
scheme. Thermal ellipsoids are given at the 50% level.

In the molecular structures of 2, 6·H2O, 9, 13, and 16, the
aminotriazole systems N(1)–N(2)–C(1)–N(3)–C(3){N(4)}–N(1)
are planar and the N(1)–C(3) [1.340(2)–1.361(3) Å],
N(3)–C(3) [1.329(2)–1.342(2) Å], and N(4)–C(3)
[1.3388(14)–1.3672(19) Å] bond lengths are intermediate
between single and double bonds, whereas the N(1)–N(2) [1.368(3)–1.3843(17)
Å] and N(3)–C(1) [1.359(2)–1.382(3) Å] distances
can be treated as single bonds and the N(2)–C(1) [1.3088(19)–1.329(2)
Å] is rather double bond (Figures 2 and S74–S78).71

2.4 Kinetic Study
In order to estimate
electronic effects of the substituents at the acyl hydrazide moiety
and in attempt to establish a correlation with one of sigma-constants
(σ, σ0, σ+, or σ–), we performed a kinetic study with a series of para-substituted
benzoyl hydrazides. The results of the 1H NMR monitoring
of the reaction rate for compounds 2, 3,
and 6 dissolved in (CD3)2CO (top)
and 2–4, 6–8 dissolved in
(CD3)2SO are shown in Figure 3; the obtained rate constant values are collected
in the table on Figure 3.

Figure 3 The initial time dependence of natural logarithm of product’s ortho-CH proton signal intensities for compounds 2, 3, and 6 dissolved in (CD3)2CO (top) and 2–4, 6–8 dissolved in (CD3)2SO (bottom). The slope
of the dependence was used to estimate the rate of pseudo-first order
reaction. aNo data due to partial heterogeneity of the
reaction mixture.

We found that neither
the nature of the solvent, nor the substituent
electronic effects significantly influence the observed pseudo-first
order rate constant k, which is ca. 10–3 s–1 in all cases. Owing the similarity of all
the calculated reaction rate constants (major part of them are the
same within 3σ), we were unable to find a correlation with any
of the sigma-constants. As can be inferred from consideration of Figure 3, there are some
deviations from the linearity at times longer than ca. 1000 s, which
are probably caused by the catalyst degradation. Based upon the kinetic
study it can be concluded that electronic effect of substituents in
acyl hydrazide does not significantly affect the reaction rate and
these data are useful for further control of the coupling.

2.5 Plausible Mechanism of the Reaction
Taking into account
our previous results and the literature data,72−74 we suggest
a plausible mechanism of the ZnII-catalyzed
coupling. Firstly, acyl hydrazide reacts with ZnCl2 to
give [Zn{RC(=O)NHNH2}3]2+ species (Scheme 4, a; these
species are known from ref (72) and one complex with R = Ph was isolated and characterized
in this work) followed by coordination of NCNR22 to the zinc(II) center (b); coordination numbers
5 and 6 are typical for the zinc(II) complexes bearing sterically
unhindered ligands.73,74

Scheme 4 A Plausible Mechanism
of the Reaction
Coordination of the
cyanamide to the zinc(II) center electrophilically
activates the C≡N group toward addition of nucleophiles.66,73 Reversible decoordination of the NH2 moiety from the
kinetically labile zinc(II) center followed by nucleophilic addition
of this group to the electrophilically activated C≡N moiety
gives the ZnII-bound N-acylamino guanidine
(c). Most likely effect of R1 on the addition
is substantially lower that the activating ability of the zinc(II)
center and, therefore, in the kinetic study the R1 effect
was not observed.

Next, solvent-supported decoordination of
the guanidine NH group
proceeds, followed by nucleophilic attack of this group to the electrophilically
activated (by coordination to the ZnII) carbonyl C atom
to give the five-membered heterocyclic ligand (d),
which undergoes further elimination of H2O accomplishing
the final 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (e) and regenerating
the catalyst (f).

3 Conclusions
This work describes a novel highly efficient synthetic methodology
for the synthesis of 3-dialkylamino-1,2,4-triazoles derived from ZnII-catalyzed acyl hydrazide and dialkylcyanamide coupling.
The optimized protocol utilizes simple and readily available reagents,
and the reaction proceeds under mild conditions to give the triazoles
in good-to-excellent yields (76–99%). The ZnII-catalyzed
reaction proceeds via initial generation of the [Zn{RC(=O)NHNH2}3](ZnCl4) complexes. Electronic effects of substituents
at the acyl hydrazide moiety do not significantly affect the reaction
rate and the yield of the target triazoles, whereas the steric hindrances
reduce the reaction rate without affecting the yield of the heterocycles.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Instrumentation
Solvents,
metal salts, and cyanamides were obtained from commercial sources
and used as received. Acyl hydrazides were synthesized from hydrazine
hydrate and carboxylic esters by the known method.75 All syntheses were conducted in air. Chromatographic separation
was carried out on Macherey-Nagel silica gel 60 M (0.063–0.2
mm). Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on unmodified
Merck ready-to-use plates (TLC silica gel 60 F254) with UV detection.
Melting points were measured on a Stuart SMP30 apparatus in capillaries
and are not corrected. ICP-AES-based elemental analysis for Zn was
performed on a Shimadzu ICPE-9000 instrument (cooling flow 10 L/min,
plasma flow 0.6 L/min, carrier flow 0.7 L/min) with utilization of
monoelemental standard for Zn (Merck). For the AES, the sample and
the standard were dissolved in 0.1 M HNO3. The calibration
curves were plotted in the range 0.001–10.0 mg/L. The mass
concentration value according to the calibration characteristic of
each element and the margin of its absolute error were calculated
on the basis of three parallel measurements of the sample. Molar conductivity
of 7 × 10–4 M solution in EtOH was measured
on a Mettler Toledo FE30 conductometer using an Inlab710 sensor. Electrospray
ionization (ESI) mass-spectra were obtained on a Bruker maXis spectrometer
equipped with an ESI source. The instrument was operated in positive
ion mode using an m/z range 50–1200.
The nebulizer gas flow was 1.0 bar and the drying gas flow was 4.0
L/min. For HRESI+, the studied compounds were dissolved
in MeOH. Infrared spectra (4000–400 cm–1)
were recorded on a Shimadzu IR Prestige-21 instrument in KBr pellets.
For the characterization, 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker Avance 400 in (CD3)2SO at ambient temperature; the residual solvent signal
was used as the internal standard.

4.2 X-ray
Structure Determinations
Crystals
of 1·H2O, 2, 6·H2O, 9, 13, and 16 suitable for X-ray diffraction (XRD) were obtained by slow
evaporation in air of a solution of appropriate triazole in Et2O at RT. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments were
carried out using Agilent Technologies “SuperNova” diffractometer
with monochromated Mo Kα and Cu Kα radiation. The crystals
were kept at 100(2) K during data collection, except for 9, which was destroyed at this temperature and it was measured at
200(2) K. The structures had been solved by the Superflip76,77 and ShelXS/ShelXT78 structure solution
programs using charge flipping and direct methods, respectively, refined
by means of the ShelXL79 program, and incorporated
in the OLEX2 program package.80 CCDC numbers
1811166, 1811167, 1811169, 1811170, 1822404, and 1822405 contain the

4.3 NMR Monitoring
of the Reaction Kinetics
Powder of any one of the acyl hydrazides
RC(=O)NHNH2 (0.21 mmol) was added to a solution
of ZnCl2 (0.021
mmol) in (CD3)2SO (0.4 mL) or (CD3)2CO (0.4 mL) placed in an NMR tube, whereupon 10-fold
excess R2′NCN (2.1 mmol) was added to the mixture. The NMR tube was closed,
and the obtained homogeneous solution was kept at 60 °C for 2
h in the NMR spectrometer. Assuming that the reaction is pseudo first-order,
the reaction rate constant k could be estimated from
the slope of the initial time dependence of the concentration of the
product. In this work, the reaction kinetics was monitored by measuring 1H NMR spectra every 48 s (4 scans, repetition time 4 s), following
the initial equilibration period of 5 min. The 1H NMR spectra
were measured on a Bruker Avance III 500 spectrometer (operating frequency
500.13 MHz for 1H). The rate constant k was estimated by measuring the logarithms of the relative (normalized)
integrated intensities of the product’s ortho-CH proton signal, fitting their initial time dependence (300–800
s) by a straight line, and calculating the slope.

4.4 Syntheses and Characterization
4.4.1 Preparation
of 1
Powder
of the benzoyl hydrazide (3.0 mmol) was added to a solution of ZnCl2 (1.5 mmol) in dioxane (10 mL) that was placed in a 10 mL
round-bottomed flask. After 5 min, the resulting precipitate was filtered
off, washed by three 1 mL portions of Et2O and dried at
50 °C in air.

Preparation of 2
Powder of 1 (1.0
mmol) was added to a solution
of Me2NCN (3.6 mmol) in ethanol (5 mL) placed in a 10-mL
round-bottomed flask. The obtained homogeneous solution was kept at
80 °C for 4 h in the tightly closed flask. The crude product
was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel (eluted with
EtOAc), and the solvent was evaporated at 50 °C in vacuo. The
crystalline residue was washed by two 1.5 mL portions of Et2O under ultrasound treatment and dried at 50 °C in air giving 2 in 98% yield.

4.4.2.2 Metal-Catalyzed Preparation
of 2–18
Powder of any one of the acyl
hydrazides RC(=O)NHNH2 (1.50 mmol) was added to
a solution of ZnCl2 (0.15
mmol) in ethanol (3 mL) that was placed in a 10 mL round-bottomed
flask, whereupon appropriate R2′NCN (1.8 mmol) was added to the mixture.
The flask was closed, and the obtained homogeneous solution (suspension
for 6, 16 and 17) was kept
at 80 °C (under vigorous stirring for 6, 16 and 17) for 6 h (for 1–6, 9, 10, 14–18) or 24 h (for 7–8, 11–13). For 14 and 16, small amounts of some solid byproducts were
formed during the reaction and they were removed by centrifugation
before the next step. Poorly soluble in EtOAc 8 was dissolved
in 100 mL of EtOAc prior to purification by column chromatography.
For 2–18, the crude product was subjected to column
chromatography on silica gel (eluted with ethyl acetate), and the
solvent was evaporated in vacuo at 50 °C. A colorless or pale
beige (for 2, 3·2/3EtOAc, 4–7, 9–13 and 15–18) or yellow
(8, 14) crystalline residue was washed by
two 1.5 mL portions of diethyl ether under ultrasound treatment and
dried at 50 °C in air.
