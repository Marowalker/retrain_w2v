The
design of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) platforms
based on the coupling between plasmonic nanostructures and stimuli-responsive
polymers has attracted considerable interest over the past decades
for the detection of a wide range of analytes, including pollutants
and biological molecules. However, the SERS intensity of analytes
trapped inside smart hybrid nanoplatforms is subject to important
fluctuations because of the spatial and spectral variation of the
plasmonic near-field enhancement (i.e., its dependence with the distance
to the nanoparticle surface and with the localized surface plasmon
resonance). Such fluctuations may impair interpretation and quantification
in sensing devices. In this paper, we investigate the influence of
the plasmonic near-field profile upon the Raman signal intensity of
analytes trapped inside thermoresponsive polymer-coated gold nanoarrays.
For this, well-defined plasmonic arrays (nanosquares and nanocylinders)
were modified by poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM)
brushes using surface-initiated atom-transfer radical polymerization.
Molecular probes were trapped inside these Au@PNIPAM nanostructures
by simple physisorption or by covalent grafting at the end of PNIPAM
brushes, using click chemistry. The SERS spectra of molecular probes
were studied along various heating/cooling cycles, demonstrating a
strong correlation between SERS intensities and near-field spectral
profile of underlying nanoparticles, as confirmed by simulations based
on the finite difference time domain method. Thermoresponsive plasmonic
devices thus provide an ideal dynamic SERS platform to investigate
the influence of the near-field plasmonic profile upon the SERS response
of analytes.

1 Introduction
Surface-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has gained popularity
over the past decades, owing to its ability to detect and identify
a large variety of compounds with single-molecule sensitivity.1−4 SERS inherits the rich chemical fingerprint information from Raman
spectroscopy and gains sensitivity through the amplification of electromagnetic
fields generated by the excitation of metallic nanoparticles (NPs)
localized surface plasmon (LSP).5−8 This optical effect results from collective oscillations
of the conductive electrons at the particle surface and is characterized
by a strong extinction in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions.9 In the near field, LSP excitation leads to huge
local electric fields in the vicinity of the nanostructures.10 As a result, when a molecule displaying a high
surface affinity is located in the immediate vicinity of NPs (distance
< 5 nm), its Raman signal can be strongly amplified and intense
SERS spectra can be collected.11−15 In contrast, the near-field effect vanishes progressively when the
analytes are located further away from the surface (distance >
5–10
nm). It is therefore a challenge to probe analytes with a small surface
affinity. To tackle this issue and concentrate the target analytes
near the NP surface, novel surface chemistries have been proposed,
relying on thiol-based chemoreceptors16 or molecularly imprinted polymers.17 Another
attractive means to trap molecules in the vicinity of plasmonic NPs
is to cover them by stimuli-responsive polymers, that is, polymers
which undergo large physical or chemical changes in response to small
external changes in their environment (such as variations of temperature,
pH, ionic strength, ...).5,18−22 The polymer shell either swells or collapses when responding to
the external stimuli. This change in volume was utilized as a means
to trap analytes and get them close to the metal core, where the electromagnetic
field is significantly enhanced, even in the case of analytes displaying
a low affinity toward the metal surface. Such stimuli-responsive plasmonic
nanostructures have been demonstrated to be ideal systems for the
detection of a wide range of analytes, including pollutants18 and biological molecules.23 The huge SERS enhancement obtained upon LSP excitation
ensures a high sensitivity, allowing acquiring the characteristic
fingerprint of any kind of target molecules even at low concentrations.
However, considering the spatial and spectral profile of plasmonic
near-field enhancement, the SERS intensities of analytes trapped inside
stimuli-responsive polymers are subject to important variations depending
on their distance from the NP surface, which could impair interpretation
and quantification in sensing devices. To date, considerable efforts
have been made to improve the sensitivity of SERS analysis using metal
NP substrates with different shapes, dimensions, and stimuli-responsive
polymers. However, to our knowledge, there is no study about the Raman
intensity fluctuations due to spatial and spectral variations of the
plasmonic near-field profile of the underlying nanostructures, when
the distance from the NP surface is dynamically modified through an
external stimulus.

In this work, we tackle this issue by investigating
the influence
of the spatial and spectral profile of the plasmonic near-field enhancement
upon the Raman signal intensity of analytes trapped inside thermoresponsive
brushes, here poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (PNIPAM).
PNIPAM was chosen as it is a widely known polymer for its lower critical
solution temperature (LCST) phenomenon with a sharp cloud point ranging
from 31 to 33 °C in water.24,25 Below the LCST, PNIPAM
brushes exist as coils because of hydrogen bonding of amide groups
with water, whereas above the LCST, the polymer conformation changes
from hydrophilic linear and flexible PNIPAM chains to hydrophobic
collapsed globules. These temperature-dependent conformational changes
were used to trap analytes in aqueous solutions and record their SERS
spectra. Nile blue A (NBA) and azobenzene (AB) were chosen as molecular
probes because of their well-known Raman signature. The experiments
were performed on well-defined and highly uniform plasmonic arrays,
obtained by electron beam lithography (EBL), allowing systematic SERS
studies. PNIPAM brushes were attached on plasmonic arrays via a combination
of diazonium salt chemistry and surface-initiated atom-transfer radical
polymerization (SI-ATRP), providing a perfect control over polymer
thickness. Two strategies (illustrated in Figure 1) were used to investigate the analyte SERS
intensity fluctuations as a function of the near-field plasmonic response:
(i) the unspecific trapping of molecular probes inside the whole PNIPAM
brushes by simple physisorption and (ii) their covalent grafting at
the end of PNIPAM brushes, using click chemistry. The thermoresponsive
plasmonic devices developed in this paper thus provide an ideal dynamic
SERS platform to investigate the influence of the near-field plasmonic
profile upon the SERS response of analytes.

of the two strategies to investigate the
SERS intensity fluctuations of two molecular probes (NBA and AB) as
a function of the near-field plasmonic response: (i) unspecific trapping
of NBA molecular probes inside the whole PNIPAM brushes by simple
physisorption and (ii) covalent grafting of AB at the end of PNIPAM
brushes, using click chemistry.

2 Results and Discussion
Regular arrays of
gold NPs (nanosquares and nanocylinders) deposited
on indium tin oxide substrates were elaborated by EBL and functionalized
by PNIPAM brushes, leading to Au@PNIPAM samples. The functionalization
strategy (see details in the Supporting Information) included two major steps: (i) the spontaneous grafting of initiators
derived from diazonium salts on gold NPs and (ii) the grafting of
PNIPAM chains from the surface via SI-ATRP. Typical AFM images of
the gold NP arrays before and after PNIPAM grafting are displayed
in Figures 2 and S2. The dry PNIPAM thickness, measured from AFM
images, was hdry ≈ 5 ± 2 nm.
Relying on a previous report, the swelling ratio of PNIPAM brushes,
defined as α = hswollen/hdry (where hswollen and hdry correspond to the swollen and
dry brush thickness, respectively), is approximately α ≈
2.27 Therefore, the thickness of swollen
PNIPAM brushes in water at T < TLCST could be estimated to be ∼10 ± 2 nm.
The extinction spectra of nanosquare Au@PNIPAM in water at 20 °C
(below the LCST), displayed in Figure 2, showed an intense localized surface plasmon resonance
 (LSPR) band at 690 nm, which slightly shifted to 695 nm at 40
°C (above the LCST) (see Figure 2). This red shift is attributed to the collapse
of polymer brushes above the LCST, leading to an increase of both
the polymer density close to the NPs and the refractive index of the
surrounding medium.

laser excitation (at 633 nm), which has been used later for the SERS
experiments. (d) Evolution of the LSP wavelength (λmax) vs temperature for nanosquare Au@PNIPAM.

The temperature dependence of the LSP wavelength, displayed
in Figure 2d, evidences
a sharp
transition around 32 °C, revealing the two conformational regimes
of polymer brushes (swollen and collapsed), as previously reported.28 Temperature-dependent SERS experiments were
then performed on Au@PNIPAM using NBA as a molecular probe. For this,
the Au@PNIPAM substrates were first immersed in an NBA aqueous solution
(at 1 nM) for 5 min and rinsed in water and ethanol. The SERS experiments
were carried out in water upon heating from 20 to 40 °C with
a 633 nm laser excitation, blue-shifted with respect to the maximum
of the LSPR of the plasmonic structures. Figure 3 shows the SERS spectra recorded on nanosquare
and nanocylinder Au@PNIPAM in water at 20 and 40 °C. The Raman
bands (gathered in Table 1) are assigned to ring-stretching vibrations at 1639, 1542,
1493, 1433, 1419, and 1350 cm–1, C–H bending
at 1256 and 1185 cm–1, C–C–C and N–C–C
in-plane bending at 664 cm–1, and C–C–C
and C–N–C deformations at 592 and 499 cm–1.

20 °C (blue spectrum) and 40 °C (red spectrum). The samples
were excited with a 633 nm laser line (power 6.8 μW) and an
acquisition time of 1s. For the sake of clarity, the SERS spectra
were vertically shifted.

λR (nm)	654	658	661	671	684	692	696	706	
These assignments are in good agreement
with the Raman signature
of NBA reported in the literature.29 Note
that although the Raman peaks of the aryl film are observed in the
absence of NBA molecules (see Figure S8), its signature is completely hidden in the presence of NBA. Remarkably,
the intensity of all NBA Raman bands was observed to increase progressively
with the temperature as shown in Figure 4, reaching an ∼3-fold increase at
40 °C, compared to 20 °C. Reversibly, cooling down from
40 to 20 °C leads to a decrease of the SERS signal almost back
to its original intensity, as illustrated in Figure 4b with the reversible increase/decrease of
the 1186 cm–1 band versus temperature. These results
emphasize the strong and reversible SERS response of Au@PNIPAM nanostructures
to the external temperature switch.

Figure 4 (a) Temperature dependence of IT/I20°C (where IT and I20°C correspond to the Raman intensity
at the temperature T and at 20 °C, respectively)

(5) 1185; (6) 1350; and (8) 1639 cm–1. (b) Reversible
intensity ratio variation of the Raman band at 1181 cm–1 with temperature increase/decrease.

These variations in the SERS signals of NBA probes with temperature
can be interpreted as follows: when the PNIPAM brushes collapse above
LCST, the analytes are trapped in the vicinity of the NP surface where
the local fields are strongly enhanced, resulting in intense SERS
spectra. In contrast, below the LCST, NBA molecules are randomly distributed
inside the swollen PNIPAM brushes and are thus located further from
the surface where the near-field enhancement vanishes. This “on/off”
switching of near-field enhancement depending on the distance between
the molecular probe and the NP surface was modeled using the finite
difference time domain (FDTD) method. In the calculations, we considered
a square array of square particles (side: 100 nm, height: 40 nm, interparticle
distance: 300 nm) displaying a LSPR in water of around 720 nm, as
shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 (a) 2D mapping of the intensity of the electric field of a square
gold particle (side: 100 nm, height: 40 nm, interparticle distance:
300 nm), calculated at the maximum of the LSP band (720 nm). The dashed
line in (a) corresponds to the selected direction used to plot the
intensity vs the distance. (b) FDTD simulation of the intensity of
the electric field vs the distance to the particle surface. Calculations
are provided at maximum of the LSPR (720 nm) and at wavelengths corresponding
to the half-height (700 and 740 nm). Inset: Calculated extinction
spectrum.

The structure was illuminated
at normal incidence along the z-axis from the glass
(see Figure S7). From the calculation,
it is clear that the electric field intensity
is maximum (“on” configuration) when the excitation
matches the LSP at λmax and decreases rapidly away
from the NP surface. When the excitation is not exactly at λmax, for example, here at wavelengths corresponding to the
half-height of the maximum (700 or 740 nm), the electric field intensity
is slightly lower but also decreases away from the NP surface. Above
5–6 nm, the intensities of the electric field calculated at
700, 720, and 740 nm are similar with low values and become close
to zero beyond 10 nm (“off” configuration). Therefore,
when the molecular probes are located less than 5 nm from the NP surface,
it is expected that their Raman peak intensities are influenced by
the local field spectral profile of the LSPR. In contrast, above 10
nm, the Raman peak intensities should follow that of normal Raman
spectra. To demonstrate this assumption, the ratio I40°C/20°C (where I40°C and I20°C correspond to the Raman
intensities at 40 and 20 °C, respectively) of various Raman bands
was calculated and plotted versus their peak frequency (see Figure 6).

Figure 6 Ratio I40°C/20°C for the
various NBA Raman bands (described in Table 1) plotted vs λ and comparison with
the extinction spectra of Au@PNIPAM arrays for (a) gold nanosquares
and (b) gold nanocylinders.

The Raman peak intensity at 40 °C, above the LCST, reflects
the “on” configuration where molecular probes are located
inside the electric field enhancement region. On the contrary, the
Raman peak intensity at 20 °C, below the LCST, reflects the “off”
configuration, where the molecular probes are located outside the
intense electric field region. In Figure 6, the evolution I40°C/20°C = f(λ) was compared with the profile of the
extinction spectrum of Au@PNIPAM. From this curve, it is clear that
the higher I40°C/20°C values
are obtained when the frequency of a particular Raman peak is close
to the LSP frequency. Generally, a remarkable correlation between
the ratio I40°C/20°C for the
distinct Raman bands [from (1) to (8)] and the spectral profile of
the LSPR was obtained for both square and cylinder Au@PNIPAM systems,
confirming the strong influence of the near-field spectral profile
upon the Raman peak intensities of analytes trapped inside collapsed
polymer chains. In these Au@PNIPAM systems, the molecular probes are
trapped inside PNIPAM brushes by simple physisorption and are thus
distributed all over the polymer layer with no control over their
distance from the NP surface. As this is a key parameter for the study
of the plasmonic near-field effect on the Raman peak intensities,
another functionalization strategy was proposed to improve the control
over molecular probe localization inside PNIPAM brushes. It consisted
of attaching AB units, at the end of the PNIPAM brushes, by click
chemistry. The optical properties of Au@PNIPAM@AB were investigated
in water upon heating/cooling cycles (see Figure 7). The LSPR was located at 635 nm in water
at 20 °C and slightly shifted to 638 nm after heating above the
LCST. The SERS spectra displayed the characteristic Raman lines of
AB derivatives with intense Raman bands at ca. 1142 and 1186 cm–1 (CN stretching modes), 1414 and 1441 cm–1 (ring modes coupled to N=N stretching), 1464 cm–1 (N=N stretching), and 1600 cm–1 (ring modes:
C=C stretching).30,31 As previously seen,
the intensity of all Raman bands was observed to increase with the
temperature as shown in Figure 7a. Contrarily, cooling down leads to a decrease of the SERS
signal back to its original intensity, as illustrated in Figure S6 with the reversible intensity increase/decrease
of the 1142 cm–1 band versus temperature. The ratio I40°C/20°C plotted versus the wavelength
λ showed a very good correlation with the LSPR of the underlying
plasmonic nanostructures with higher enhancement measured when the
Raman peaks approach the LSP wavelength (see Figure 7b). This last experiment confirmed that the
variations in Raman intensities of molecular probes attached on thermoresponsive
brushes reflect the spectral dependence of the near field of the plasmonic
structures.

Figure 7 (a) Raman spectra of gold nanocylinder arrays covered by PNIPAM
with AB probes at the end chains recorded in water at 20 °C (blue
spectrum) and 40 °C (red spectrum). The sample was excited with
a 633 nm laser line (6.8 μW), with an acquisition time of 30
s. (b) Ratio I40°C/20°C for
the various Raman bands at (1) 592; (2) 1142; (3) 1186; (4) 1441;
and (5) 1464 cm–1 plotted vs λ and comparison
with the extinction spectra of Au@PNIPAM@AB.

In order to evidence the correlation between the normalized
SERS
intensities and the plasmon profile, it is important to mention that
the plasmonic arrays have been designed here so that their plasmon
bands were optimized for the SERS measurements, that is, close to
the 633 nm laser line. This is a necessary condition to detect any
molecular probe at a low concentration. However, these SERS experiments
could be extended to different laser excitations, by modifying the
geometrical parameters of the nanostructures, in order to match the
plasmon band with another laser wavelength. In this case, it is expected
that the normalized SERS intensities will also qualitatively follow
the far-field response of the structures, as these intensities precisely
depend on the spectral profile of the plasmon band.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have investigated the influence
of the spatial and
spectral profile of the plasmonic near-field enhancement upon the
Raman signal intensity of analytes trapped inside PNIPAM thermoresponsive
brushes. For this, well-defined plasmonic arrays (nanosquares and
nanocylinders) were modified by PNIPAM brushes using SI-ATRP, resulting
in 5–10 nm thick PNIPAM brushes anchored on the NP surface.
Molecular probes were trapped inside these Au@PNIPAM nanostructures
by simple physisorption or by covalent grafting at the end of PNIPAM
brushes, using click chemistry. The optical properties of these plasmonic
devices were investigated during heating/cooling cycles, resulting
in conformational changes of PNIPAM brushes from a swollen to a collapsed
state. The SERS intensity of molecular probes was highly enhanced
above the LCST (at 40 °C), when the molecules were located very
close to the NP surface, compared to the SERS signals recorded at
20 °C, below the LCST. This behavior was well illustrated by
following the ratio I40°C/20°C for the distinct Raman bands as a function of the wavelength λ.
Generally, a remarkable correlation was obtained between this ratio
and the spectral profile of the LSPR. These results emphasize the
strong influence of the near-field spectral profile of the underlying
plasmonic nanostructures upon the Raman peak intensities of analytes
trapped inside collapsed polymer chains. In other words, the near-field
optical response appears to be closely related to the far-field optical
response of the NPs. These thermoresponsive plasmonic devices thus
provide an ideal dynamic SERS platform to investigate the correlation
between the far-field plasmonic profile and SERS response of analytes.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Reagent
grade solvents
were purchased from VWR Prolabo and Alfa Aesar. 2-Bromopropionyl bromide
(97%, Aldrich), triethylamine (99%, Merck), CuBr (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), N,N,N′,N″,N″-pentamethyldiethyltriamine
(99%, Acros Organics), and NBA (>75%, Sigma-Aldrich) were used

4.2 Functionalization of Gold Nanostructures by
PNIPAM Brushes
The gold nanostructures, elaborated by EBL,
were functionalized by PNIPAM thermosensitive polymer brushes, following
a multistep strategy relying on three major steps: (i) spontaneous
grafting of aryl groups derived from 4-hydroxyethylbenzene diazonium
tetrafluoroborate salt to produce −CH2–CH2–OH-terminated aryl moieties, covalently anchored to
the surface, (ii) esterification of the anchored groups with 2-bromoisobutyryl
bromide, and (iii) grafting of PNIPAM brushes via SI-ATRP (see the Supporting Information and Figure S1). The synthesis
of diazonium salt is described in the Supporting Information.

4.3 Instrumentation
AFM measurements
were performed on a Nanoscope III digital instrument microscope in
tapping mode in air. Contact mode AFM was applied in water with a
contact SNL-10 silicon tip commercially available from Bruker. Vibration
frequency of the tip is chosen at around 7Hz to achieve a stable signal-to-noise
ratio in water. AFM images were processed and analyzed using the applications
WSxM and FabViewer.26 The extinction spectra
were recorded by far-field extinction microspectroscopy in the 500–1000
nm spectral range. The spectrometer was coupled to an upright optical
microscope equipped with 50× (Olympus, numerical aperture NA
= 0.35) and 100× (Olympus, NA: 0.8) objectives for experiments
in air. Extinction spectra recorded in water at various temperatures
used a 100× immersion objective (Olympus, NA: 1). Raman spectra
were recorded using a Jobin-Yvon LABRAM HR 800 microspectrometer,
using a He–Ne laser excitation (632.8 nm) in backscattering
mode. For the experiments in water, the microscope was equipped with
a ×100 immersion objective (6.8 μW power). All spectra
were recorded within the 400–1800 cm–1 spectral
range.
