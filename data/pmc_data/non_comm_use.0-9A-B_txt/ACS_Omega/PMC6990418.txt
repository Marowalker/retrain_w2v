Effects of deformation texture and
grain size on mechanical properties
and corrosion behavior of the Mg–3Al–1Zn (AZ31) alloys
were systematically investigated. The results revealed that the ultimate
tensile strength (UTS) and fracture elongation (FE) significantly
increased from 232 to 273 MPa and 12.5 to 26.4%, respectively. According
to the immersion and electrochemical measurements, the results indicated
that the corrosion resistance of the alloy was improved obviously.
Via electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD), corrosion morphology
showed that the propagation of local pitting corrosion was suppressed,
which is ascribed to grain refinement, higher texture intensity, and
lower dislocation density after rolling and subsequent annealing.

1 Introduction
In
recent years, magnesium (Mg) alloys are considered as the lightest
structural materials that can provide tremendous weight-saving potential
in various fields, such as aircraft, high-speed rail, and automotive
industries.1,2 Also, Mg–3Al–1Zn (AZ31) alloy
has become one of the most popular commercial Mg alloys due to their
excellent mechanical properties, machine-ability, and cast-ability.3,4 However, Mg-based alloys usually suffer from poor corrosion resistance,
which is one of the important obstacles that limit their widespread
applications. This is mainly due to the high reactivity of the magnesium
alloy and the unstable passivating characteristic film formed on the
alloy surface upon atmospheric exposure.5,6 Therefore,
it is great significance to study the factors that affect the corrosion
characteristics and corrosion mechanism of magnesium alloys. On the
one hand, alloying can be used to enhance the corrosion resistance
of magnesium alloys.7 For example, Pan
et al. reported that Mg–Al–Mn alloys have the best corrosion
resistance when 2 wt % of Ca was added; it is mainly because the discontinuous
(Mg,Al)2Ca phase could act as an anode to protect the Mg
substrates.

On the other hand, deformation can also enhance
the corrosion resistance
of magnesium alloys. Hot-rolling is a traditional deformation processing
that can not only improve mechanical properties but also enhance corrosion
resistance of various metal materials.8−11 For example, Cheng et al.8 reported that the corrosion resistance of the
Mg–6Bi–2Sn alloy is obviously improved after rolling,
mainly attributed to the internal microstructure of the alloy, grain
refinement, advantageous crystal orientation, and finely distributed
second-phase particles. Moreover, the corrosion resistance of the
Mg–5Li–1Al alloy has been enhanced by hot-rolling, which
was ascribed to the evolution of texture, the appearance of twins,
and protective oxide surface films.9 In
general, the strong basal texture and the lower surface energy of
the Mg alloy can result in the increase of corrosion resistance.10,11 Hence, combined heat treatment and hot-rolling can significantly
improve the properties of magnesium alloys. After rolling and subsequent
annealing, the AZ31 sheet exhibits high strength and good ductility,
mainly owing to the homogenous microstructure with weak basal texture
and fine grains.12,13

Moreover, heat treatment
also can make the precipitation phase
along the grain boundaries dissolve into the Mg matrix, which could
decrease the formation of the microcathode.3 Heat treatment can be carried out before or after extrusion. On
the one hand, corrosion resistance was enhanced due to the decrease
of the second phase size and more uniform distribution by the solution
treatment before extrusion.14 On the other
hand, solution treatment of the extruded magnesium alloy sheet can
decrease the corrosion rate.15 Meanwhile,
annealing treatment can decrease the dislocation density and twins
produced in the matrix by the severe plastic deformation, resulting
in further enhancement of the corrosion resistance.16,17 However, Ha et al.18 demonstrated that
the rate of H2 evolution was accelerated because of the
increased area fraction of grain boundaries. Furthermore, such microstructural
evolution in Mg alloys could have a significant influence on their
corrosion behavior after rolling and subsequent annealing.

So
far, it has not been clearly understood the effect of grain
boundaries during the process of Mg alloy corrosion, as well as the
dominant role of grain refinement and texture strength in the increase
of corrosion resistance. In this paper, we obtained a homogenous microstructure
with different grain sizes and deformation textures by combining thermomechanical
deformation and annealing treatment on the AZ31 alloy. Moreover, the
microstructural evolution, mechanical properties, and corrosion behavior
of the samples were further characterized. Besides, the morphology
after removing corrosion products was analyzed by electron backscattered
diffraction (EBSD). The results show that the initiation of corrosion
mainly occurs inside of the grains and the propagation of local pitting
corrosion was suppressed by grain boundaries.

2 Experimental
Methods
2.1 Material Preparation
The as-extruded
AZ31 magnesium alloy sheets were starting materials in this study.
Mg–3Al–1Zn-based alloys were fabricated from commercial
pure Mg (99.85%), Al (99.90%), and Zn (99.90%). First, alloying components
were melted at 700 °C completely under the protection of a mixed
gas atmosphere in an electric resistance furnace containing CO2 and SF6 and then poured into a preheated cylindrical
steel mold with a dimension of ϕ 94 × 20 mm2. The cast rods were machined to a diameter of 90 mm followed by
subsequent homogenization treatment at 430 °C for 5 h in a resistance
furnace. The rods were subjected to an extrusion process at 390 °C
with an extrusion ratio of 33.19 Eventually,
as-extruded slabs were formed with a cross-section size of 40 mm (width)
× 4.8 mm (thickness). Chemical composition of the as-extruded
alloys (Al of 2.56 wt %, Zn of 0.84 wt %, with the balance being Mg)
was analyzed by an optical spectrum analyzer (ARL 4460, Switzerland).
Solution treatment was carried out on the as-extruded alloy slabs
at 415 °C for 20 h, and then, they were cut into plates by wire
electrical discharge machining with dimensions of 40 mm (length) ×
15 mm (width) × 4.8 mm (thickness). Subsequently, traditional
hot-rolling was performed on the as-received AZ31 alloy sheets at
350 °C and repeated for seven passes with a reduction of ∼20%
per pass. The thickness of the final rolled plate was 1 mm, and total
rolling reduction of ∼79% was achieved without edge cracking.
Then, the as-rolled plates were annealed-treated for 30 min at 400
and 200 °C, and the samples are referred to as AT 400 and AT
200, respectively. Schematic illustration of the rolling and annealing
process is presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration showing the process of rolling and annealing.

2.2 Sample Characterization
Microstructures
of AZ31 alloys in solution treatment, as-rolled, and annealed conditions
were observed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM; ZEISS EVO18,
Germany). The SEM characterization of metallographic samples was performed
by pregrinding with 2000-mesh SiC papers, polishing with 0.5 μm
diamond pastes, followed by chemical etching in acetic picric solution
(5 g of picric acid, 5 mL of acetic acid, 10 mL of distilled water,
80 mL of ethanol) for about 20 s. Grain orientation and microtexture
evolution were investigated by a SEM (VEGA 3 XMU, TESCAN, Czech),
which is equipped with an Oxford Instruments NordlysNano electron
backscattered diffraction (EBSD) detector. The data was collected
and analyzed by AZtec and Channel 5.0 software. Moreover, EBSD characterization
was performed at 20 kV, with a sample tilt angle of 70°, 0.8–0.9
μm scan steps, and scan area of 250 × 250 μm2. EBSD samples were prepared by electropolishing special polishing
solutions (AC2) at 20 V for 90 s under −30 °C.

Tensile
samples of dimensions 30 mm (length) × 10 mm (width) × 1.0
mm (thickness) were cut off from as-received AZ31, as-rolled, and
annealed alloy plates parallel to the rolling direction (RD) and extrusion
direction (ED). Tensile tests were performed at room temperature (RT)
under a strain rate of 1.0 × 10–3 m s–1 by a material testing system (MTS; 810 testing machine). Each sample
was tested at least 3–5 times so as to verify the good repeatability
of stress–strain curves. The Vickers hardness experiment was
carried out with a load of 200 g (Hv0.2) by using a microhardness
tester (1600–5122 VD), and the duration time is 15 s at room
temperature. The hardness value of each sample was measured ten times
at different locations, and the test surface is perpendicular to the
rolling direction.

2.3 Immersion and Electrochemical
Measurements
The corrosion behavior of each sample was evaluated
through an
immersion test and electrochemical experiment. The 3.5 wt % NaCl solution
(mL) and the sample surface area (cm2) were 100/1, more
information of which can be found in the literature.17 Samples were suspended in the middle of a funnel and placed
into a beaker containing sodium chloride, and evolved hydrogen was
collected by a burette at 25 °C for 7 days, which also measured
the corrosion rate of the sample simultaneously by calculating the
weight loss. Corrosion products were removed by immersing the sample
in a mixed cleaning solution of chromic acid for 5 min, containing
200 g/L CrO3 and 2 g/L AgNO3. Then, the samples
were cleaned with ethanol and dried with a blower. The dried samples
before immersion and after removing corrosion products were weighted.
The corrosion rate, CW (mm y–1), was evaluated by the following equation20 1  where Δm (mg)
is the
sample weight loss before the immersion test and removing corrosion
products, A is the exposed area of the samples surface,
and t (d) is the immersion duration.

Electrochemical
polarization tests were conducted at 25 °C in 3.5 wt % NaCl solution
using an electrochemical workstation (Gamry reference 600, America).
The experiment was performed at a typical three-electrode cell, consisting
of a working electrode (samples) with an exposed surface area of 1
cm2, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference
electrode, and a platinum plate (1.0 × 1.0 × 0.1 mm3) as the counter electrode. Open-circuit potentials (OCPs)
of samples were recorded in the NaCl solution, and the time duration
was maintained at 30 min to obtain a stable state before the test
of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The equivalent circuit
model was used to analyze the EIS data by ZSimpWin software. The sinusoidal
signal had an alternating current (AC) amplitude of 5 mV, and the
frequency range is 105–10–2 Hz.
Potentiodynamic polarization curves were gathered from −500
to 500 mV relative to OCP with a sweep rate of 0.5 mV s–1. Corrosion potential (Ecorr, V) and
corrosion current density (icorr, A cm–2) were calculated by Tafel extrapolation according
to the polarization curve. All immersion and electrochemical tests
were carried out at least 3 times, and all curves with a good repeatability
are presented.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Microstructural Characterization
Figure 2 shows the
microstructure images of SEM and the corresponding grain size (GS)
distribution of as-received AZ31, as-rolled, AT 400, and AT 200 alloy
sheets. In Figure 2a, only few Mg17Al12 particles distributed
in the as-extruded AZ31 alloys after solution treatment. While rolling
seven passes with a total reduction of ∼79%, the grain size
of alloy sheets was reduced to ∼8 μm due to dynamic recrystallization
(DRX), and some deformation twins were created. Moreover, fewer second
phases (Mg17Al12) in the samples were found
after annealing treatment, and the samples present an equiaxed recrystallization
microstructure, as shown in Figure 2c,d. As shown in Figure 2e–h, a relatively large average grain size of
solution-treated samples of ∼22 μm was found; the AT
400 and AT 200 samples’ average grain sizes were ∼11
and ∼4 μm, respectively. The grain size distributions
are statistical analysis (average linear intercept measured with SEM
microscopy). As can be seen from aforementioned results, the grains
size refined obviously after rolling and then annealing.

of (a) as-extruded AZ31 plate after solution treatment,
(b) as-rolled, (c) AT 400, (d) AT 200, and the corresponding grain
size distribution (e–h).

In addition, the grain orientation and microtexture evolution of
the samples are characterized in Figure 3 via EBSD. As shown in Figure 3a,c,d, most grains oriented with c-axes in ⟨001⟩ were observed in the solution-treated
and annealed samples. In addition, the grain size is in good accordance
with the aforementioned SEM images and the corresponding grain size
distribution. Moreover, their corresponding {0002} pole figures exhibited
a strong basal texture, as shown in Figure 3e,g,h. The EBSD orientation maps of the as-rolled
sample with a total reduction of ∼79% are shown in Figure 3b. The unrecognized
area (black area) is due to the large number of dislocations inside
of the rolled sample. As shown in Figure 3f, the texture intensity of as-rolled alloy
sheets went up from 17.1 to 34.7. The difference of temperature in
the process of solution treatment and annealing can cause recrystallization,
resulting in a basal texture weakness.21

figurers (e–h). Low- (2° < θ < 15°) and
high- (15° < θ < 90°) angle grain boundaries
are depicted by gray and black lines in EBSD orientation maps, respectively.

To further investigate the microstructure, kernel
average misorientation
(KAM) maps of the as-received AZ31, as-rolled, and annealed samples
are shown in Figure 4. The corresponding number fraction of KAM is shown in Figure S1. KAM values in terms of the density
of geometrically necessary dislocations reveal the local misorientation
level.22 The results show that the as-extruded
AZ31 plate after solution treatment leads to a lower KAM value as
shown in Figure 4a.
However, a high density of dislocations (green and black area) was
generated after seven passes rolling, and the results are displayed
in Figure 4b. The microstructures
of AT 400 and AT 200 samples consist of fully recrystallized grains,
and due to static recrystallization (SRX), the dislocation density
of alloy sheets decreased significantly as shown in Figure 4c,d. As mentioned above, the
main microstructural evolutions caused by hot-rolling and annealing
are grain refinement, favorable crystal orientation, and low density
of crystalline defects.

3.2 Effects of Microtexture Evolution on Tensile
Properties
The engineering stress–strain curves and
the results of Vickers hardness (Hv) measurement are presented in Figure 5. The values of ultimate
tensile strength (UTS), yield strength (YS), fracture elongation (FE),
and Vickers harness (Hv) are listed in Table 1. Obviously, compared with the as-received
AZ31 sample, the UTS and YS of the sample after seven passes rolling
increased from 232 to 313 and 124 to 223 MPa. First, this is mainly
ascribed to the presence of high-density dislocation in the as-rolled
alloy sheets as shown in Figure 4b. On the other hand, after hot-rolling, the sheet
shows a strong basal texture and the basal plane is parallel to the
tensile axis, which dramatically increased the critical resolved shear
stress (CRSS).13,23 Therefore, the FE values drastically
decreased from 12.5 to 6.2%. Mg and its alloy’s lack of slip
systems resulted in a large Taylor factor, and hence the stress of
Mg alloy sheets exhibits a strong dependence on grain size.13 In the present study, as for the AT 200 alloy
sheets, the average grain size reached ∼4 μm, which is
much lower than that of the as-received AZ31 of ∼22 μm.
The increase of UTS and YS is mainly ascribed to grain refinement
strengthening resulting from hot-rolling and subsequent annealing.
According to the Halle–Petch relationship (σs = σ0 + kd–0.5), the decrease of grain size results in more grain boundaries that
can improve the impediment of dislocation movements. It should be
noted that the AT 200 alloy exhibited an FE of 26.4%, which is 2.1
times higher than that of the as-received AZ31 alloy. Furthermore,
the microstructures of AT 400 and AT 200 were refined, and the Vickers
hardness values of AZ31 alloys increased from 58.5 to 63.5 and 68.1
Hv, respectively.

3.3 Hydrogen Evolution and
Mass Loss
The hydrogen evolution volume and corrosion rate
(CW) of all of the samples are illustrated
in Figure 6. As shown
in Figure 6a, the collected
hydrogen volume
of each sample presents a nonlinear relationship with immersion time.
During the early period, the rate of H2 evolution is faster.
However, with the increase of reaction time, the H2 evolution
rate slows down. This phenomenon is mainly attributed to the increased
pH of the solution and the protection of corrosion products. The hydrogen
evolution volume of the AT 200 sample was lower than that of the as-received
AZ31, as-rolled, and AT 400 samples throughout the immersion period.
As shown in Figure 6b, the weight loss measurement was used to calculate the daily corrosion
rates (CW) of each sample by using eq 1. Moreover, the correlated
average corrosion rates are listed in Table 2. The values of average corrosion rates are
2.35, 1.51, 1.23, and 1.05 mm y–1 for the as-received
AZ31, as-rolled, AT 400, and AT 200 alloy sheets, respectively. The
results clearly indicate that the corrosion resistance of the as-received
AZ31 alloy was improved by combining hot-rolling with annealing.

Figure 6 (a) Hydrogen
evolution volume and (b) corrosion rates (CW) of all of the samples were calculated by
weight loss measurement. The samples were immersed in 3.5 wt % NaCl
solution for 7 days. Corrosion products were removed by immersing
in a chromic acid cleaning solution (200 g/L CrO3 + 2 g/L
AgNO3) at 25 °C for 5 min.

3.4 Electrochemical Measurements
3.4.1 Open-Circuit Potential (OCP)
Figure 7 shows the open-circuit
potential (OCP) curves of all of the samples immersed in 3.5 wt %
NaCl solution for 1800 s. It is reported that an increasing OCP value
represents the initiation and propagation of corrosion. Meanwhile,
a relatively stable OCP value indicates the advance of corrosion and
the deposit of corrosion products in a steady state.24 It can be seen that the OCP values of all of the samples
maintained a relatively stable state after immersion for 1800 s. The
stable OCP values of the sample can be ranked as AZ31 < as-rolled
< AT 400 < AT 200. Compared with the as-extruded AZ31 plate
after the solution-treated sample, the AT 200 sample exhibited a higher
stable value of ∼12 mV (vs SCE). A previous study has demonstrated
that the formation of a more protective surface layer on the Mg alloy
led to a higher OCP value.25 However, slight
fluctuations of the OCP values were probably caused by local pitting
corrosion.26

(OCP) versus time curves of the as-received
AZ31, as-rolled, AT 400, and AT 200 samples immersed in 3.5 wt % NaCl
solution for up to 1800 s.

3.4.2 Potentiodynamic Polarization Curves
The
potentiodynamic polarization curves of as-received AZ31, as-rolled,
AT 400, and AT 200 alloy sheets were obtained in 3.5 wt % NaCl solution
as shown in Figure 8. The anodic and cathodic branch curves represent the dissolution
of the magnesium matrix and the hydrogen evolution, respectively.27 The electrochemical parameters were determined
from the Tafel extrapolation method, and the results are summarized
in Table 2. Generally,
smaller icorr and positive Ecorr represent a lower dynamic corrosion rate and thermodynamical
corrosion tendency, respectively.28,29

Figure 8 Potentiodynamic
polarization curves of as-received AZ31, as-rolled,
AT 400, and AT 200 samples.

Carefully inspecting the data, the Ecorr and icorr of as-received AZ31 alloy
sheets were 1.552 V (vs SCE) and 2.49 × 10–4 A cm–2, respectively. After rolling seven passes,
the Ecorr of the sample increased to 1.529
V (vs SCE) and the icorr decreased to
1.48 × 10–4 A cm–2. The corrosion
resistance of as-rolled alloy sheets was enhanced because of a stronger
basal texture, which is well consistent with previous reports.9,30 Compared with the AT 400 sample, the lower corrosion resistance
of the as-rolled alloy sheets was mainly caused by the higher dislocation
density (Figure 4b).31 With the increase of dislocation density, the
local potential tends more to disequilibrium, leading to the increase
of the dissolution rate of the anode metal.32 While subsequently annealing at 200 °C, the Ecorr tends to become more positive (1.491 V vs SCE) and
the icorr further reduced to 3.21 ×
10–5 A cm–2 (AT 200). It is clearly
found that the grain size and dislocation density in the alloy sheets
decrease because the SRX occurred after annealing treatment (Figure 4d). In addition,
the second phase in the Mg matrix, which acts as a microcathode, could
decrease the corrosion resistance of the Mg substrate.3 In this study, few second-phase particles were found inside
as-received AZ31 and AT alloy sheets, so that the effect of Mg17Al12 on the corrosion rate was not considered.
The electrochemical polarization results showed a good agreement with
hydrogen evolution and weight loss measurement results.

3.4.3 Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)
Generally,
EIS is applied to evaluate the corrosion behavior of
the samples. Figure 9 shows the EIS curves of as-received AZ31, as-rolled, AT 400, and
AT 200 samples measured in 3.5 wt % NaCl solution after 1800 s stabilization.
Obviously, the Nyquist plots of four samples all consisted of a capacitive
loop in the high- and medium-frequency regions and a low-frequency
inductance loop, as labeled in Figure 9a. It could be clearly seen that the diameter of the
capacitive loop increased gradually after rolling and subsequent annealing,
which indicated that the AT 200 sample exhibited the best corrosion
resistance. In general, the presence of a high-frequency capacitive
loop could be attributed to the feature of a double electric layer
in the electrochemical reaction process, which corresponds to the
degradation of the Mg matrix. The inductance loop at the low-frequency
region was related to corrosive pitting and the influence of corrosion
products produced during the corrosion process.3,33 Meanwhile,
the Bode modulus plots of impedance vs frequency are shown in Figure 9b; it could be found
that the impedance value of AT 200 alloy sheets in the low-frequency
region was higher than the other alloy sheets. As shown in Figure 9c, the Bode plots
of phase angle vs frequency consist of two time constants; the one
in the low-frequency range corresponds to the resistance of the corrosion
product film, and the other in the high-frequency range results from
the double-layer capacitance and the corresponding charge transfer
resistance in the presence of corrosion products.20 Besides, the two wave crests imply two capacitance loops,
and the single wave trough occurring in the low-frequency range represents
the inductance loop.

Bode plots of phase angle, and (d) equivalent circuit models used
for fitting the electrochemical impedance spectra for the four alloy
sheets.

To further clarify the corrosion
mechanism of the above alloy sheets,
the EIS spectrum was simulated, and the appropriate electrochemical
equivalent circuit is depicted in Figure 9d. Here, Rs represents
the solution resistance; Rct is charge
transfer resistance; and RL and L represent resistance and inductance, which are used to
describe the low-frequency loop and the initiation of localized corrosion,
respectively.34 The constant phase element
(CPE), Q, is used to represent the double-layer capacitance
(Cdl); the calculation of Cdl can be estimated by using Brug’s formula35−37 2  where Q is the CPE value
(Ω–1 sn cm–2) and n is the CPE dimensionless
exponent. If n is approximately equal to 1, the Q is identical to an ideal capacitor.38 The corresponding fitting results are listed in Table 3; it can be found
that the Rct value of the AT 200 sample
is approximately 3 times that of the as-received AZ31 plate. The Cdl values were 10 and 3.52 μF cm–2 for the AZ31 and AT 200 samples, respectively. Generally, the higher
values of Rct indicate the lower degradation
of the Mg substrate, and the lower Cdl values imply a more compact surface.16,24 Therefore,
hot-rolling and subsequent annealing are beneficial to enhance the
corrosion resistance of as-received AZ31 alloy sheets, which is well
consistent with the results of the polarization curve test.

To further clarify the initiation
of corrosion and the role of
grain boundaries in the corrosion process, as-received AZ31, AT 400,
and AT 200 alloy samples were processed by electropolishing and then
immersed in 3.5 wt % NaCl solution for 30 min. The EBSD test was conducted
after removing corrosion products; the IPF maps and the corresponding
band contrast images of the three samples are displayed in Figure 10. As shown in Figure 10a, a large corrosion
area (black area) was observed on the surface of the AZ31 alloy with
a grain size of ∼22 μm, which represents the corrosion
area and H2 evolution. After annealing at 400 and 200 °C,
the grain size of the alloy decreased to ∼11 and ∼4
μm, and the corrosion area on the samples reduced, as can be
seen in Figure 10b,c.
Meanwhile, from Figure 10a–c, the initiation of corrosion mainly occurs inside
grains and then gradually expands with prolonging immersion time.
This indicated that the grain boundaries as a physical barrier played
an important role in the corrosion process, leading to the propagation
of local pitting corrosion being suppressed in the grain refinement
alloy sheets. Hence, smaller grain sizes increased the grain boundary
area. As a consequence, the corrosion resistance of the alloys with
smaller grain sizes was obviously improved.

Figure 10 IPF maps of (a) as-received
AZ31, (b) AT 400, and (c) AT 200 samples
immersed in 3.5 wt % NaCl solution for 30 min. Corrosion products
were removed by immersing in chromic acid solution (CrO3 200 g/L + 2 g/L AgNO3) and the corresponding band contrast
image (d–f), respectively.

In addition, after immersing in 3.5 wt % NaCl solution for 7 days
and then removing the corrosion products, the corroded surface morphologies
of the alloys are shown in Figure 11. As for the as-received AZ31 alloy, it corroded seriously,
with very large and deep corrosion pits observed on the surface, as
can be seen in Figure 11a. After rolling seven passes, some localized corrosion still existed,
as shown in Figure 11b. However, no obvious corrosion pits were seen on the surface of
the AT 200 sample, as shown in Figure 11d. Therefore, these phenomena further demonstrated
that the hot-rolling and subsequent annealing are beneficial to improve
the corrosion resistance of the as-received AZ31 alloys.

AT 400, and (d) AT 200 samples after immersion in 3.5 wt % NaCl solution
for 7 days. Corrosion products were removed by immersing in chromic
acid cleaning solution (CrO3 200 g/L + 2 g/L AgNO3) at 25 °C for 5 min.

To better understand the influence of grain sizes on the corrosion
behavior of alloy sheets, the schematic illustration is provided in Figure 12. In the initiation
stage of corrosion, the corrosion of alloy sheets with both large
and small grain sizes occurred inside of the grains (Figure 10). As shown in Figure 11d, no obvious corrosion pits
appeared, and the corrosion morphology mainly exhibited shallow corrosion.
As for the alloy sheets with larger grains, more large grains were
gradually corroded and resulted in the formation of corrosion pits.
With the extension of immersion time, the corrosion area was enlarged
and the depth of corrosion pits was deeper than that of the uniformly
refined grain alloy sheets.

process of (a) as-received
AZ31 and (b) AT 200 samples.

4 Conclusions
The microstructures of
the as-received AZ31 alloy sheets were homogenized
by hot-rolling and subsequent annealing, which caused obvious grain
refinement, few second-phase particles, higher fraction of grain toward
basal orientation, and a lower dislocation density. Moreover, the
ultimate tensile strength (UTS), yield strength (YS), and fracture
elongation (FE) increased from 232 to 273 MPa, 124 to 205 MPa, and
12.5 to 26.4%, respectively, mainly attributed to more uniform grain
size and weakened basal texture after static recrystallization. The
corrosion resistance of the as-received AZ31 alloy was improved by
the hot-rolling and subsequent annealing, which can be mainly ascribed
to the more uniform refined microstructure and the lower dislocation
density. The EBSD results of the corrosion morphology revealed that
the initiation of corrosion mainly occurred inside of grains and the
propagation of local pitting corrosion was suppressed by grain boundaries.
