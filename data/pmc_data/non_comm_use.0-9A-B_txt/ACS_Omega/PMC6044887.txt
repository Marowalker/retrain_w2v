The
current work focuses on the fabrication of high-molecular-weight
stereocomplex poly(lactic acid)/nanohydroxyapatite (sPLA/n-HAP)-based
bionanocomposite for three-dimensional (3D)-printed orthopedic implants
and high-temperature engineering applications. To achieve the same,
n-HAP is grafted with poly(d-lactic acid) (PDLA) via in situ
ring-opening polymerization of d-lactide, followed by blending
with poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA), which yields sPLA/n-HAP
biocomposite with improved storage modulus even at temperatures higher
than 140 °C. X-ray diffraction and calorimetric analysis ensure
the presence of 100% stereocomplex crystallites of biocomposite along
with significant improvement in the melting temperature (∼227
°C). Noteworthy improvements in the mechanical and gas-barrier
properties of the developed biocomposites are achieved due to the
uniform dispersion of n-HAP (∼60 nm) confirmed by morphological
studies. An unusual improvement in elongation at break (∼130%
at 1 wt % HAP loading) makes this composite a toughened material.
However, the tensile strength is improved by ∼16%, whereas
oxygen permeability and water vapor transmission rate are found to
reduce by ∼48 and ∼34%, respectively. Interestingly,
the developed material is processed as monofilament, followed to 3D
printing to yield a middle phalanx bone as a representative example
of orthopedic implants. In vitro studies reveal that cell adhesion
and proliferation on the surface of the developed biocomposite support
its biocompatible nature. This signifies the possible future aspects
of the material in commercial biomedical and high-temperature engineering
applications.

Introduction
In the recent past, poly(lactic acid)
(PLA) has been considered
as a potential candidate to replace the traditional petroleum-based
thermoplastics for several applications, such as textile, agriculture,
biomedicine, packaging, and other engineering disciplines.1 PLA can be produced using lactic acid monomer,
which is a chiral molecule and has been derived from renewable agricultural
resources.2 Because of the chiral properties
of lactic acid, PLA has two semicrystalline stereoisomers: poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) and poly(d-lactic acid) (PDLA).
It is known that PLLA and PDLA can be crystallized in several polymorphs,
such as α, β, and γ, formed under different processing
conditions.3 In 1987, Ikada et al. reported
the formation of a special type of polymorph in PLA by mixing PLLA
and PDLA, called stereocomplex, made by combining right- and left-handed
helical polymer chains, and found its melting temperature to be 50
°C higher than that of the normal enantiomeric pure PLA.4 A similar phenomenon was also seen by Miyamoto
et al. in stereospecific poly(methyl methacrylate).5 Because of the intermolecular
hydrogen bonding between PLLA and PDLA molecules, stereocomplex crystallites
undergo compact polymer chain packing than being homocrystals.6 Stereocomplexation in PLA promises superior thermal,7,8 mechanical,9,10 thermomechanical,11 and barrier properties12 to enantiomeric pure PLA, which makes it an interesting polymorph
to study.13

The formation of stereocomplex
crystallites is highly dependent
on the specific arrangement of PLLA and PDLA chains in the blend,
and it becomes complicated due to the similar temperature range for
crystallization of homocrystals and stereocomplex crystallites. It
has been confirmed that stereocomplex crystallites with a trace amount
of homocrystals can be formed by mixing PLLA and PDLA in 1:1 ratio.9 Furthermore, it is limited to polymers with low
molecular weight, such as less than 100 kDa, and the amount of homocrystals
has been found to be excessively high in case of high-molecular-weight
polymers (higher than 100 kDa).14 Therefore,
development of PLA with a higher content of stereocomplex crystallites
is the prevailing issue among polymer scientists to obtain PLA with
enhanced mechanical, barrier, and thermal properties.

In this
context, several research groups are trying to develop
different techniques, such as solid-state polymerization,15 development of stereo diblock copolymer,16 supercritical fluid technology,17,18 layer-by-layer assembly,19 and so forth,
to prepare relatively high-molecular-weight PLLA/PDLA blends with
high content of stereocomplex crystallites. Some of the researchers
have used modified or unmodified fillers, such as nanocrystalline
cellulose,20 nanographite,21 graphene oxide,22,23 carbon nanotube,24−26 lignin,27 and other polymers.28−30 The present work demonstrates the use of hydroxyapatite as a filler
into the PLA matrix. Nanohydroxyapatite (n-HAP) is a bioactive nontoxic
complex form of calcium phosphate, which constitutes 60–70%
of mammalian bones. It can be produced by several biological or synthetic
methods, such as precipitation, hydrothermal and sol–gel method,
hydrolysis, and solid-state synthesis31 from bioresources, such as eggshells, seashells, plants, animal
bones, and so forth.32 Because of its similarity
to mammalian hard tissues, n-HAP is one of the most investigated synthetic
biomaterials. Substantial research has been carried out by a number
of researchers for the fabrication of PLA/n-HAP biocomposite for different
applications.33−36 It is essential to modify n-HAP due to its poor interfacial adhesion
with PLA and poor mechanical properties.37 To avoid the agglomeration of n-HAP particles, researchers have
grafted n-HAP with PLA via in situ ring-opening polymerization (ROP).
Du and his colleague developed the poly(d,l-lactic
acid) (PDLLA)-grafted n-HAP via solution ROP in toluene and explored
it for the shape memory application.38 Qiu
and his group modified the n-HAP surface with lactic acid in toluene
before grafting with PLLA at 130 °C for 80 h and blended with
PLLA at 170 °C. The prepared composite displayed good mechanical
properties and uniform microstructure.39 In the same direction, Hong et al. found good dispersion of n-HAP
in polymer matrix after grafting with PLA in xylene solution, which
led to the improvement in the mechanical properties.40 Similarly, Wang and his group modified the surface of n-HAP
with lactic acid oligomer and found the improved dispersion, which
led to the enhancement in the properties of the end product.41 A number of researchers have grafted n-HAP,
which involves solvents, and these methods are not industrially viable. To our knowledge, no study addressing the modification of n-HAP in
bulk and its application in the development of stereocomplex poly(lactic
acid) (sPLA) has been conducted so far.

Therefore, the current
work was dedicated to develop a facile process
to graft n-HAP via in situ bulk ROP of lactide. sPLA/n-HAP biocomposite
was developed with different n-HAP content. The molecular structure
and the mechanical, thermal, thermomechanical, and barrier properties
of the prepared biocomposite were investigated, which evidently demonstrated
the usability of grafted n-HAP in the enhancement of stereocomplexation
in PLA and its ultimate high-temperature engineering application.
It promises better compatibility with PLA molecules, which was determined
by morphological studies. sPLA and the developed composites were further
tested for cell adhesion and proliferation to explore their potential
as a biomaterial. The developed material was melt-processed to form
filaments for three-dimensional (3D) printing to explore its possible
application as orthopedic implant.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of Fabricated n-HAP
n-HAP is characterized
by electron microscopy to identify the morphology and size of the
particles, as shown in Figure 1. At 20k× magnification, it was difficult to clearly
identify separate n-HAP particles (Figure 1a). The images at higher magnification (50k×)
show the particles of n-HAP. The particle size is found to be in the
range of 30–60 nm. However, some fraction
of particles are found as agglomerates as big as ∼3 μm.
The contents of phosphate (P) and calcium (Ca) are measured by energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) analysis, as shown in Figure 2. The average ratio Ca/P is found to be 1.68,
which confirms the fabrication of n-HAP.42

particles at 20k× (a) and 50k× (b).

Raman spectroscopy is
a powerful tool for the analysis of minerals.43 Raman spectra of the prepared n-HAP are investigated
and presented in Figure 3 against wavenumber. The observed Raman bands are found in agreement
with the literature.44 The characteristic
peak of phosphate ion associated with fully symmetric P–O–P
stretching mode in n-HAP is found at 962 cm–1.45 The band at 157 cm–1 belongs
to Ca-PO4 in double-bending mode, whereas the bands at
430 and 589 cm–1 are assigned to PO43– in a triply degenerate bending mode. The 1051 cm–1 peak corresponds to triply degenerate antisymmetric
stretching mode of PO43–.46

Figure 4 presents
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of fabricated n-HAP nanoparticles,
showing intense well-resolved peaks. The crystalline peaks are observed at 25.8, 28.9, 31.9, 32.8, 42.1,
46.7, 49.5, and 53.3° corresponding to (002), (210), (211), (300)(202),
(310), (311), (222), (213), and (004) planes.47 The obtained results are in agreement with the hydroxyapatite fingerprint
reported in the literature.48

Chemical Modification of
n-HAP
To improve the dispersion
and homogeneity into PLA matrix, n-HAP is modified by grafting with
PDLA via bulk ROP of d-lactide. It was assumed that the hydroxyl
group present in n-HAP molecule would contribute as a coinitiator
for the ROP of lactide by coordination insertion mechanism along with
catalyst tin octoate.49 It is clearly known
that n-HAP is not soluble in solvents like chloroform; however, it
partially dissolved and formed a stable suspension when grafted with
PDLA (Figure 5). The 13C NMR study of PDLA- and PDLA-grafted n-HAP is done, and
the results are presented in Figure 6. It is found that the peaks present at chemical shifts
16.6, 69.1, and 169.4 ppm correspond to the methyl, methine, and carbonyl
carbons of the PLA chain. In comparison to the spectra of PLA/n-HAP,
one additional chemical shift was found at 175.3 ppm, which corresponds
to the terminal carbonyl carbon connected with the oxygen–calcium
element of n-HAP. A similar mechanism of grafting of PLA with starch
has been described elsewhere.50 The schematic
representation of the grafting of n-HAP with PDLA is shown in Figure 7.

Figure 5 Dispersion of grafted
n-HAP in comparison with pristine n-HAP in
chloroform.

Figure 7 Schematic representation of grafting of n-HAP with PDLA.

Further, it is known that n-HAP is an inorganic
material that is
thermally stable below 900 °C and does not lose its molecular
structure at higher temperature.51 In this
case, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) can be an effective method
to calculate the amount of PDLA chain connected with n-HAP. A comparison
of TGA graphs of n-HAP and PDLA/n-HAP is shown in Figure 8. Approximately 2.2% reduction
in weight loss is found in case of PDLA/n-HAP compared to pristine
n-HAP, which suggests that ∼2.2% of PDLA is chemically bound
to n-HAP molecules, which degrade against increase of temperature.

of weight loss of PLA/n-HAP and n-HAP against temperature.

sPLA/n-HAP Biocomposite
Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectra of sPLA and sPLA/n-HAP biocomposites are presented
in Figure 9a. All of
the samples display similar spectra to sPLA. The peaks at 2923 and
2847 cm–1 are assigned to the stretching vibration
of −C–H of PLA. The band at 1747 cm–1 corresponds to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching of PLA. The
band at 1452 cm–1 corresponds to the bending of
methyl group, and the peak at 863 cm–1 is assigned
to −C–C– stretching of the backbone of PLA molecule.
FTIR spectra are highly sensitive to the arrangement of the chains
in crystalline segment. The peak at 908 cm–1 in Figure 9b is attributed to
the 31 β helical structure of sPLA chains.7 The intensity of the peak is increased as the
content of n-HAP is enhanced, which qualitatively suggests the increase
in the content of stereocomplex crystallites in the matrix. The interaction
between carbonyl carbon of one enantiomeric PLA and methyl group of
the other enantiomeric PLA, which form the hydrogen bond, leads to
the formation of stereocomplex crystallites. This hydrogen bonding
affects the vibration peak at 1038 cm–1 assigned
to the C–CH3 group of PLA,52 which red-shifted to 1035 cm–1 corresponding to
the C=O···CH3 stretching mode (Figure 9c), confirming the
formation of stereocomplex crystallites.53

cm–1) of sPLA and sPLA/n-HAP biocomposites.

It is well known that the stereocomplex
crystallites in PLA have
a higher melting temperature than normal PLA homocrystals.4 The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis
of sPLA and other sPLA/n-HAP biocomposites is shown in Figure 10a. The thermogram indicates
that sPLA is found to have the crystals of homopolymers with trace
amount of stereocomplex crystallites. The endotherm at 152 and ∼178
°C is associated to the melting of homocrystals, which may be
the result of α′ and α forms of crystallites,54 and melting peak at ∼210 °C corresponds
to the stereocomplex crystallites. An increase in the content of grafted
n-HAP in polymer matrix leads to increase in the melting enthalpy
(ΔHm,sc) of the stereocomplex crystallites
from ∼17 J g–1 for sPLA to ∼55 J g–1 for sPLA-2.5% n-HAP and helps in the reduction of
melting enthalpy (ΔHm,hc) of homocrystals
from ∼28 J g–1 (sPLA) to 0 J g–1 (sPLA-5% n-HAP) (Table 1). Increase in melting temperature from ∼210 °C
for sPLA to ∼227 °C for sPLA-2.5% n-HAP suggests the perfectness
and increased amount of stereocomplex crystallites. Reduction in the
degree of crystallization (Xc,hc) for
homocrystals is found from ∼30% for sPLA to 0% for sPLA-2.5%
n-HAP. The degree of crystallization (Xc,sc) for stereocomplex crystals was improved from ∼12% for sPLA
to ∼39% for sPLA-2.5% n-HAP with no trace of melting enthalpy
for homocrystals, which reaches to 100% fraction of stereocomplex
crystallites, as shown in Figure 10b.

Further, the effect of grafted n-HAP on stereocomplexation
in PLA
matrix is analyzed using XRD. The XRD patterns of sPLA and sPLA/n-HAP
biocomposites are shown in Figure 11. It is known that the sPLA chains arrange themselves
in a triclinic unit cell with dimensions of a = 0.916
nm, b = 0.916 nm, c = 0.870 nm,
α = β = 109.2°, and γ = 109.8°, which
is having a 31 helical structure (3 Å increase per
unit of monomer).55 The XRD patterns at
peaks 11.8, 20.6, and 23.9° are related to stereocomplex crystallites
and correspond to the (110), (300)/(030), and (220) lattice planes,
whereas the homopolymer PLA crystallizes (α form) in a pseudo-orthorhombic
unit cell of dimensions a = 1.07 nm, b = 0.595, and c = 2.78 nm, holding a 103 helical structure (10 Å increase per 3 units of monomer). Peaks
for PLA at 14.7, 16.6, and 19° in XRD correspond to (010), (200/110),
and (203) crystal planes. It is clear from the pattern that the peaks
related to the stereocomplex evolved and the peaks related to the
homocrystals are diminished with increase in the grafted n-HAP content.

Figure 11 XRD
of sPLA and sPLA/n-HAP biocomposites.

The above discussion suggests that the presence of grafted
n-HAP
in the polymer matrix helps in the development of stereocomplex crystallites,
thus limiting the evolution of the homocrystals. This improvement
leads to the enhancement of other properties of biocomposites.

Effect
of Grafted n-HAP on the Mechanical and Thermomechanical
Properties of sPLA
The presence of a filler in the polymer
matrix enhances the mechanical and thermomechanical properties; however,
homogenous dispersion of fillers is the most critical parameter. Effective
ways to improve the dispersion is the modification of fillers with
diluting matrix element. In this work, the filler, that is, n-HAP,
is grafted with PDLA, which was miscible in the PLLA matrix, which
led to the uniform dispersion of n-HAP. The FESEM analysis of the
fractured surface of sPLA and sPLA/n-HAP biocomposites is shown in Figure 12. The fractured
surface of sPLA (Figure 12a) is smooth and free of any foreign particles, whereas in
the sPLA/n-HAP (Figure 12b) biocomposite, the n-HAP particles of ∼60 nm are
found to be uniformly dispersed.

Figure 12 FESEM images of fractured surface of
sPLA (a) and sPLA/n-HAP (b)
biocomposites.

The presence of grafted
n-HAP in PLA matrix is playing a dual role:
as homogeneously reinforced filler into the matrix and providing the
extended molecular surface area, in the form of PDLA chains, which
efficiently interacts with PLLA chains forming the stereocomplex crystallites. Load–elongation curve for sPLA and sPLA/n-HAP
biocomposites is presented in Figure 13a. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS) is found to
improve by ∼16%, that is, 40.2 MPa, for sPLA-2.5% n-HAP compared
to that of sPLA, that is, 33.8 MPa. Improvement in the degree of crystallinity
suggests significantly more intermolecular bonding and cross-linking
in the form of stereocomplexation, which may be responsible for the
increment in the tensile strength. It also suggests the strong interfacial
bonding between n-HAP and polymer chains. The elongation at break
is found to be 131.6% for sPLA-1% n-HAP compared to 6.3% for sPLA
(Figure 13b), which
implies that the ductility of sPLA is significantly improved with
incorporation of modified n-HAP. It is known that the improvement
in ductility ensures the delay in fracture, which reduces the abrupt
failure of the biocomposite. The integrated molecular surface area
in the form of PDLA on modified n-HAP acts as a bridge between the
sliding and elongating polymeric chains and prolongs the breakage
process. It also suggests a strong interaction between matrix and
filler and may be a result of chain uncoiling or chain sliding in
the biocomposite.56 However, the elongation
at break is reduced to ∼55% in case of sPLA-2.5% n-HAP. Increase
in the content of n-HAP in the matrix ensures the upsurge in the tensile
strength due to the confinement of polymer chains and the formation
of stereocomplex crystallites. However, n-HAP particles present in
the matrix at higher amount may generate voids during the elongation
process, which ultimately induce breakage and rupture of bonds, resulting
in the reduction in elongation at break in sPLA-2.5% n-HAP compared
to sPLA-1% n-HAP.

Figure 13 (a) Representative data for stress of sPLA and sPLA/n-HAP
biocomposites
against elongation percentage at break. (b) UTS and elongation at
break of sPLA and sPLA/n-HAP biocomposites.

The effect of grafted n-HAP on the thermal stability of the
sPLA/n-HAP
biocomposite is analyzed by measuring the storage modulus and tan δ
in the temperature range of 30–180 °C on applied dynamic
force using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) in tensile mode. The
storage modulus of sPLA and sPLA/n-HAP biocomposites is shown in Figure 14a. The storage
modulus at 30 °C is found to be ∼1243 MPa in case of sPLA,
which is enhanced to ∼2350 MPa for sPLA-2.5% n-HAP and remained
higher than that of sPLA or other sPLA/n-HAP biocomposites throughout
the temperature range. This improvement in the storage modulus of
biocomposites indicates the stiffness of viscoelastic polymer, which
resists the deformation on the action of applied force and can also
be attributed to the increased polymer chain rigidity. The loss tangent
curve is shown in Figure 14b as a function of temperature. The peaks are related to the
glass transition of the polymers, indicating the movement of amorphous
polymeric chains, which is the transition of material from hard glassy
state to soft rubbery state. Changes in the peak
shape with increase in n-HAP content indicate the relationship between
polymer structure and internal molecular motion. The fillers present
in the polymeric system affect the glass transition by developing
hindrance to the movement of polymer chains. The peak becomes flattened
in case of sPLA-2.5% n-HAP, which may be the result of hindrance to
polymer chains developed by n-HAP nanoparticles as well as increase
in the stereocomplex crystallites content. This increase in the stereocomplexation suppresses the intensity
of tan δ peak for sPLA-2.5% n-HAP compared to sPLA, as
discussed in the previous section that the stereocomplex crystallites
are more tightly packed than the homocrystals, which induces chain
rigidity.57 This analysis suggests that
the prepared biocomposite was thermally more stable than pristine
sPLA at elevated temperature.

Figure 14 (a) Storage modulus of sPLA and sPLA/n-HAP
biocomposites against
temperature; (b) tan δ of sPLA and sPLA/n-HAP biocomposites
against temperature.

From the above discussion, it can be concluded that the grafted
n-HAP plays a dual role, that is, to develop the homogeneously dispersed
biocomposite and supporting the formation of stereocomplex crystallites
in sPLA/n-HAP biocomposite via providing the extended molecular surface
area in the form of PDLA, which interacts with PLLA and form the stereocomplex
crystallites. The formation of stereocomplex crystallites in the presence
of grafted n-HAP was delineated in the schematic shown in Figure 15.

Figure 15 Schematic for the formation
of stereocomplex crystallites in sPLA/n-HAP
biocomposite.

Barrier Properties
The barrier properties of the polymers
are the crucial parameters to decide their targeted applications.
The prepared biocomposite films are analyzed for the oxygen permeability
and water vapor permeability. oxygen transmission rate (OTR) results
are shown in Figure 16 at different temperatures, which show a significant drop of nearly
48% in oxygen permeability at 23 °C. The molecular compactness
and degree of crystallinity are the parameters that highly affect
the gas permeability. The formation of stereocomplex crystallites
due to the presence of grafted n-HAP increases the compactness of
the polymer chains. Increase in the crystalline density directly affects
the oxygen permeability as the diffusion of oxygen molecules is hindered
in crystalline domain.58 The FESEM analysis
of fractured surface, as discussed in the previous section, showed
the homogeneous dispersion of n-HAP indicating the interaction of
polymer chains with n-HAP particles, which are responsible for the
formation of stereocomplex crystallites. n-HAP may also be contributing
to the reduction in the oxygen permeability by developing a tortuous
path for the oxygen molecules.

Figure 16 Oxygen permeability of sPLA and sPLA/n-HAP
biocomposites at different
temperatures.

Water vapor permeability
of sPLA and sPLA/n-HAP biocomposites is
shown in Figure 17, in which a 34% reduction was observed for sPLA-2.5% n-HAP compared
to sPLA. The grafting of the n-HAP with PDLA chains enhances the interaction
of n-HAP with polymeric chains, which increase the dispersion, resulting
in the enhancement of stereocomplexation. Improvement in the degree
of crystallinity affects the bulk surface property of sPLA and makes
it resistant to moisture. The development of stereocomplex crystallites
may be responsible for the hindrance to the diffusion of water molecules.

Cell Adhesion and Proliferation
BHK-21 cells are used
for the determination of the biocompatible nature of the developed
material. The cell viability assay indicates that the cell survivabilities
on sPLA, sPLA-1.0% n-HAP and sPLA-2.5% n-HAP (Figure 18) are almost similar, which suggests no
adverse effect of the addition of filler (hydroxyapatite) in the sPLA
matrix. The nuclei of the cells stained with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) showed its intact nature, indicating the cell adhesion and
proliferation on the surfaces of sPLA, sPLA-1.0% n-HAP, and sPLA-
2.5% n-HAP (Figures 19 and 20). These results suggest the potential
biomedical application of the fabricated n-HAP-based biocomposite.

The fabricated biocomposite is

mini-extruder to produce the filament with ∼1.6 mm diameter,
which was used for 3D printing of the representative middle phalanx
bone successfully, as shown in Figure 21. This ensures that the developed material
had the ability to be processed using an industrially viable process,
that is, melt processing, which is further utilized for designing
the desired product using 3D-printing technique.

Conclusions
Successful fabrication and grafting of
n-HAP (∼60 nm) with
PDLA via in situ bulk ROP of d-lactide is carried out, which
is confirmed by 13C NMR and TGA, leading to the production
of high-molecular-weight PDLA/n-HAP biocomposite. sPLA/n-HAP biocomposite
is produced with 100% stereocomplex crystallite content with a melting
temperature of ∼227 °C. It is concluded that the grafted
n-HAP plays a dual role, that is, to develop homogeneous dispersion
in the polymer and the formation of stereocomplex crystallites by
providing the extended molecular surface area in the form of PDLA
chains. Improved stereocomplexation ultimately affects the elongation
at break (132%), tensile strength (40.2 MPa), and storage modulus
(∼47%). The enhancement in the stereocomplexation results in
48 and 34% reduction in oxygen permeability and water vapor transmission
rate (WVTR), respectively. The concise summary can be portrayed by
displaying the application of the lab-synthesized material in high-temperature
engineering as well as biomedical applications. The synthesized material
was tested for cell viability, melt-processed, and further utilized
for 3D printing of the finger (middle phalanx) bone. This highlights
the importance of the developed material for designing commercial-value
products. The finger bone made using 3D-printing technique can further
be tested for osteoblast cell proliferation and differentiation to
determine the rate of formation of natural bone synthesized by bone
cells. This could further give new directions to the scientific approach.

Experimental
Section
Materials
l-Lactide and d-lactide
were produced from l-lactic acid (Purac, India) and d-lactic acid (Musashino, Japan), respectively, by a two-step polymerization
and depolymerization procedure. l-Lactic acid or d-lactic acid was dehydrated to obtain oligomeric PLLA or PDLA, which
was further depolymerized in the presence of tin oxide to obtain l-lactide or d-lactide, respectively, and used after
purification. Tin oxide (SnO) and stannous octoate (tin octoate) were
procured from Sigma-Aldrich. Catalyst solution was prepared by dissolving
1 g of tin octoate in 10 mL of toluene (Merck, India). high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade chloroform and hydrochloric acid
(HCl) were purchased from Merck, India. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was
obtained from HiMedia Laboratories, India. All of the chemicals were
used as received.

Preparation of n-HAP from Fish Scale
Hydroxyapatite
nanopowder (n-HAP) was fabricated in the laboratory using fish scales
(Labeorohita), which are considered as biowaste.
Raw fish scales were collected from a nearby local fish market in
Guwahati, Assam, India. Initially, the fish scales were washed several
times in running tap water to remove dirt and other contaminants.
The washed fish scales were deprotonated by stirring with a 1 M HCl
solution for 24 h at room temperature. Thereafter, the fish scales
were neutralized with a 1 M NaOH solution, followed by dilution with
deionized water with pH 7. Excess water was removed by filtration
through a filtration unit. Cleaned deprotonated fish scales were dried
in a hot-air oven at 50 °C for 4–5 h to remove the excess
amount of moisture. The dried scales were then calcinated in a programmable
box furnace (B/F 14-15, VB Ceramic Consultants, India) at 1150 °C
for 3 h to evaporate or remove the organic content. The nanosized
HAP was obtained by wet-milling the calcinated flakes of fish scales
in the mono ball milling machine (Planetary Mono Mill PULVERISETTE
6 classic line, Fritsch, Germany) for 3 h at 290 revolutions per minute
(rpm) at room temperature.59,60 Before wet milling,
the calcinated scales were mixed with deionized water to make the
slurry, and zirconia balls (0.8–1.0 mm diameter) were added
in 10:1 weight ratio. After removing the zirconia balls by filtration,
homogenization was carried out by a homogenizer (Digital Homogenizer,
IKA) with 6000 rpm at 5 °C for 15 min and the obtained slurry
was lyophilized (LaboGene, SCANVAC) for 72 h at −95 °C
to obtain a nanoparticulate of HAP. The obtained n-HAP was stored
for further experiments.

Preparation of PDLA-Grafted n-HAP
n-HAP was grafted
with PDLA via bulk ROP of d-lactide. A dried ampoule equipped
with a magnetic stirrer was filled with required amount of purified d-lactide, n-HAP, and tin octoate. Lactide to catalyst molar
ratio ([L]/[C]) was maintained at 2000:1. The ampoule was purged with
argon gas for 1 h to remove moisture and oxygen. Vacuum was applied
to the ampoule for 2 h to eliminate the excess amount of toluene.
The ampoule was sealed using a heating torch under vacuum condition,
and oil temperature was increased to 105 °C. Mixing of monomer,
n-HAP (1, 2, and 5 wt %), and catalyst was done for 2 h; then, the
temperature was increased to 160 °C and the ampoule was left
for further 2 h for ROP. The obtained PDLA-grafted n-HAP was recovered
by breaking the ampoule and named as PDLA/n-HAP; some amount of ungrafted
PDLA was also formed, which remained with the PDLA/n-HAP composite.
In the same fashion, PLLA and PDLA were also synthesized. The granulated
forms of PLLA, PDLA, and PDLA/n-HAP were kept in a vacuum oven at
40 °C for 12 h to remove the residual monomer.

Preparation
of sPLA/n-HAP Biocomposite
To prepare the
sPLA/n-HAP biocomposite, PDLA/n-HAP and PLLA in 1:1 weight ratio were
dissolved in 70 mL of chloroform (5% hexafluoroisopropanol solution)
in a single-necked round-bottom flask at room temperature for 48 h.
The obtained solution was cast on a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE,
150 mm diameter) Petri dish kept at room temperature. The Petri dish
was covered with perforated aluminum foil to reduce the rate of evaporation
of solvent. After drying for 24 h, the obtained film was kept in a
vacuum oven at 60 °C for 48 h to remove the residual content
of solvent. The sPLA biocomposites
with final content of 0.5, 1, and 2.5% n-HAP were denoted as sPLA-0.5%
n-HAP, sPLA-1% n-HAP, and sPLA-2.5% n-HAP, respectively, whereas the
blend of pristine PLLA and PDLA was indicated as sPLA. The prepared
biocomposite films were used for further characterization.

Characterization
Raman spectra of n-HAP was recorded
by Laser Micro Raman System (model: LabRam HR, make: Horiba Jobin
Yvon) at room temperature. The spectra were recorded from wavenumber
2000 to 100 cm–1. Plasma-filtered laser light (514
nm) was focused onto the sample with 50× objective exposed for
15 s. The prepared n-HAP powder was directly analyzed, and the spectra
were recorded by 10 accumulation.

Gel permeation chromatography
(Shimazdu, Japan) was used to determine the molecular weight of the
prepared biocomposite at 40 °C. The eluent used was HPLC-grade
chloroform with a flow rate of 1.0 mL min–1. The
system was calibrated using the monodispersed polystyrene standard.
The prepared biocomposite was dissolved in chloroform and filtered
through 0.45 μm PTFE syringe filters before analysis. The molecular
weight and specific rotation of the PLLA, PDLA, and PDLA/n-HAP biocomposites
are tabulated in Table 2.

The chemical structures
of PDLA and PDLA-grafted n-HAP were determined by a 600 MHz nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscope (Bruker, Germany). 13C NMR spectra of samples were recorded after dissolving the samples
in deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) for 48 h.

Calculation
of the amount of PDLA grafted on n-HAP was made by
TGA (PerkinElmer). Weight loss of the sample (6–8 mg) was recorded
by heating under the temperature range of 30–700 °C at
a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 under an inert
N2 environment. PDLA-grafted n-HAP was purified by removing
the unreacted PDLA chains from the system via dissolution and centrifugation,
followed by a drying process before analysis.

The FTIR spectra
of the biocomposites were obtained by attenuated
total reflection (ATR) mode in Frontier FT-IR spectrometer (PerkinElmer)
at room temperature. The spectra were recorded after 16 scans from
wavenumber 4000 to 650 cm–1. The prepared biocomposite
was directly analyzed, and the spectra were recorded.

Field
emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) connected with
an EDX spectrometer was used to determine the topography of the fractured
surface of different samples placed on carbon tape. Gold sputtering
was carried out for 30 s, followed by characterization using FESEM
(Sigma, Zeiss, GmbH) at an accelerating voltage of 2–4 kV.

The thermal behavior of the biocomposite was measured using a differential
scanning calorimeter (DSC) (Phoenix DSC 204 F1NETZSCH, GmbH) under
nitrogen atmosphere. The thermograph was recorded by heating the sample
from 20 to 250 °C at a 10 °C min–1 heating
rate. The percentage crystallinity of sPLA and biocomposite was calculated
as per the following equations 1   2   3  where Xc,sc and Xc,hc are
the degrees of crystallinity of stereocomplex
crystallites and homocrystals, respectively; ΔHm,sc and ΔHm,hc are
the enthalpies of fusion at melting for stereocomplex crystallites
and homocrystals, respectively; ΔHmp,sc and ΔHmp,hc are the heats of fusion
of a perfect crystal (93.6 J g–1 for homocrystals
and 142 J g–1 for stereocomplex crystallites);55 ΔHc is the
enthalpy of cold crystallization; and fsc (%) is the percentage of fraction of stereocomplex crystallites
into the system.

Model-D8 Advance system diffractometer (Bruker,
Germany) was used
for the XRD analysis. The instrument was equipped with Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm) as X-ray source (40 kV, 40 mA) operating
at a scan rate of 3° per min in the 2θ ranges of 5–40°
(for composites films) and 20–55° (for n-HAP power) to
generate the spectra.

The tensile strength and percentage elongation
of prepared samples
(7 mm width, ∼0.2 mm thickness and 15 mm gauge length) were
measured using Tensile Stress Testing Stage (TST 350, Linkam) equipped
with a 20 N load cell at a constant cross speed of 1 mm min–1 in tensile mode. The stage was controlled by system controller PE95/T95
with the system software Linksys 32. Each sample was analyzed with
five replicates, and the average results were reported along with
standard deviation.

The thermomechanical stability of the prepared
biocomposites at
higher temperatures with dynamic force application was measured using
DMA (DMA 242 E model, NETZSCH, GmbH) in the temperature range of 25–190
°C at a 2 °C min–1 heating rate, 1 Hz
frequency, and 10 μm displacement amplitude.

OX2/231 oxygen
permeability tester (Labthink, China) was used to
determine the OTR for the biocomposites with varying amount of n-HAP.
The measurements were performed as per ASTM D3985 standard at 15,
23, 35, and 45 °C using high-purity oxygen gas (99.999%) on a
film having an area of 50 cm2. Pure oxygen (99.9%) at a
pressure of 0.5 bar and a flow rate of 20 mL min–1 was maintained in the upper half of the sample chamber during analysis,
whereas nitrogen gas was maintained in the lower half of the chamber.
The chambers were purged for 6 h before measurement. The test was
carried out for at least 6 h so as to reach the steady state.

PERMATRAN-W model 1/50 (Mocon) was used to determine the WVTR as
per ASTM standard E398-03. The relative humidity (RH) was fixed as
100 and 10% in the dry and wet chambers, respectively, yielding a
driving force of 90% RH. The film of 50 cm2 area was analyzed
at 37.8 ± 0.1 °C under atmospheric pressure.

In Vitro Studies
Cell
Seeding and Cultivation
Baby Hamster Kidney fibroblast
cells (BHK-21) were obtained from National Centre for Cell Science
(Pune, India). The BHK-21 cells were cultured in T25 culture flasks
containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin,
1% l-glutamine, and 1% pyruvate (Invitrogen). The cells were
incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The cells were recultured and maintained further for cell
adhesion and proliferation assay. The cells were stained with trypan
blue (SRL) and counted using Countess II FL Automated Cell counter
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). The circular films of sPLA, sPLA-1.0%
n-HAP, and sPLA-2.5% n-HAP were placed in the wells of a 96-well plate
(Nunc) after sterilization by autoclave. To examine the cell viability,
2 × 104 cells/well were seeded onto the films using
100 μL of DMEM per well with polystyrene microplate as a control.
All of the studies were carried out in triplicates, and the average
data of the obtained results were reported with standard deviation.

MTT Assay
Mitochondrial activity of BHK-21 cells seeded
onto the developed biocomposite films was assessed by enzymatic conversion
of tetrazolium dye MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) after the time intervals of
8, 16, 24, 48, and 72 h. MTT reagent was prepared by dissolving 5
mg of MTT in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After each interval,
10 μL of MTT reagent was added to every well and incubated for
3 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere. Later, the MTT reagent
was removed from the wells and 100 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide
(Merck) was added to dissolve the formosan crystals. Absorbance were
measured using plate reader (Thermo Fischer Scientific) at 570 nm
with reference wavelength of 650 nm.

Cell Staining
To determine the biocompatibility of
the developed films, BHK-21 cells were seeded on a 12-well plate coated
with circular films of sPLA, sPLA-1.0% n-HAP, and sPLA-2.5% n-HAP
and maintained. The cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (dilactate)
following 36 h of incubation (Sigma-Aldrich). DAPI stock (5 mg mL–1) was prepared in water and diluted to 1:2500 in 1%
PBS solution. The cell medium was then aspirated completely, followed
by rinsing with PBS thrice. The cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde,
incubated for 10 min, and further rinsed with PBS thrice. The cells
were then permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 after 5 min, allowed
to aspirate, and rinsed thrice with PBS. DAPI (300 μL) was added
to the wells and incubated for 15 min in dark. This was followed by
aspiration and rinsing the cells thrice with PBS. Fluorescence was
captured by exciting DAPI with ultraviolet light and was detected
through a blue/cyan filter. The images were captured using FLoid Cell
Imaging Station (Thermo Fischer Scientific) at 20× resolution.

Three-Dimensional Printing of Middle Phalanx Bone
The
middle phalanx bone as a representative orthopedic implant was printed
using 3D printer (model: Hydra 250, make: REDD Robotics, India) at
220 °C with a bed temperature of 110 °C. The layer resolution
was kept constant at 0.2 mm. The print speed was 50 mm s–1, fill density was 40%, and bottom and top thicknesses were kept
to be constant (0.6 mm). The filament used for the 3D printer was
fabricated via a twin-screw mini-extruder (HAAKE MiniLab II from Thermo
Scientific) with a 1.5 mm diameter circular die. The filament diameter
was found to be 1.6 ± 0.2 mm.
