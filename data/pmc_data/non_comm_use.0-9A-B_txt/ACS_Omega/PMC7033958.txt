Ni
is widely used in the field of corrosion protection because
of its stability, hardness, and ductility. Inspired by the excellent
hydrophobicity of walnut wood, imparted by its porous structure, we
synthesized a morph-genetic, porous Ni sheet. A pyrolyzed walnut template
was immersed in a Ni2+ solution, allowing Ni to be electroplated
on the surface and to enter the skeleton’s pores. After calcination
and surface modification, a template-free, low-surface-energy Ni sheet
was obtained and accurately investigated by scanning electron microscopy
and contact angle goniometry to evaluate its morphology and hydrophobicity.
The results show that the Ni sheet inherited the complementary structure
of the template, and, in turn, its water-repelling ability. We were
able to measure contact angles as large as 150°, demonstrating
that the new surface morphology endowed Ni with superhydrophobicity.

1 Introduction
Life on earth has undergone
long periods of adaptation and development
and has constantly evolved and been optimized to adapt to the changing
environment. One of nature’s masterworks is the creation of
hydrophobic surfaces, evolved to withstand a variety of conditions
that benefit from water repulsion. In particular, superhydrophobic
surfaces continue to amaze scientists, who constantly propose new
strategies to reproduce their incredible properties, inspired by the
potential industrial applications.1 Since
these surfaces possess self-cleaning and anticorrosion properties,
are resistant to freezing, and can reduce adhesion to water, special
efforts have been made to endow metals with superhydrophobic properties.2

Nickel is a magnetic transition metal with
outstanding hardness,
heat resistance, and corrosion resistance; properties preserved in
its alloys as well.3 Superhydrophobic Ni
surfaces have attracted increasing attention because of their potential
applications in aircrafts, radar systems, missiles, tanks, ships,
spacecrafts, and other military technologies.4 The key to producing a superhydrophobic Ni surface is to create
a low-surface-energy material with a rough surface microstructure.5 To date, several methods for preparing superhydrophobic
surfaces have been reported, including electroplating,6 micromolding and patterning,7 phase separation,8 etching,9 sol–gel,10 and
electrostatic spinning techniques.11

Hardwood can be obtained from a multitude of angiosperm trees found
in many regions of the world, and several varieties possess excellent
hydrophobicity, because of their surface structure. In particular,
walnut is a hardwood that contains pores of different sizes, a feature
that was shown to impart superhydrophobicity.12

In a walnut wood cross section, many densely distributed pores
can be seen, even by macroscopic observation. The underlying microstructures
are shown in Figure 1: pores with different diameters are tightly packed on the wood’s
surface, with large pores, i.e., those with a mean diameter of about
160–250 μm, present only in minority. Pores with diameters
of 5–20 μm are arranged closely to form a honeycomb-like
structure with a wall thickness of approximately 1 μm. This
particular porous framework is an excellent air trap, and when water
falls on the wood’s surface, the air layer acts as an effective
barrier to water infiltration. Therefore, the honeycomb-like structure
of walnut wood can be used as a template for designing superhydrophobic
surfaces.

of walnut wood.

In this study, inspired by the
novel concept of morph-genetic materials,
a superhydrophobic Ni sheet was synthesized using walnut wood as a
template.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Phase
Identification
Figure 2a shows the X-ray diffraction
(XRD) spectrum of a Ni sheet sample right after calcination and before
fluoroalkyl silane (FAS) treatment. The peaks located at 44.5, 51.8,
and 76.3° correspond to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of
Ni (PDF# 04-0850 Ni), respectively, which confirmed that a Ni coating
was successfully electroplated on the carbon skeleton. In addition,
some low-intensity peaks can be observed at 37.2, 43.2, 62.9, and
75.4°, attributed to the presence of NiO (PDF# 47-1049, NiO).
We speculate that NiO was formed by the oxidation of Ni coating during
the high-temperature calcination phase. According to the XRD pattern,
no other main components, besides Ni and NiO, were present on the
sample’s protuberant surface.

calcination and before
FAS treatment and (b) energy-dispersive spectrum (EDS) of a Ni sheet
after FAS treatment.

Figure 2b shows
the EDS spectrum of a Ni sample after modification with FAS. The EDS
spectrum indicates that the main elements present were Ni, F, O, and
a small amount of C. A large amount of F was present, indicating that
FAS successfully bonded to the surface. In addition, the carbon signals
were assigned to wood residues persisting on the surface even after
the second aerobic calcination process.

2.2 Macrostructure
and Hydrophobicity of the Prepared
Nickel
To explore the effects of electroplating time on the
morphology and properties of the surface, the samples were prepared
with different electroplating times. Figure 3a–d shows the optical images of the
samples fabricated using different electroplating times (0.5 h (a),
1 h (b), 1.5 h (c), and 2 h (d)), alongside their relative water droplets’
shape and contact angle (CA). The samples had dimensions of approximately
6 mm × 8 mm and displayed a green, rough coating on the surface.
Based on XRD results, the green coating was attributed to NiO accumulated
during the calcination step. Moreover, the contact angles of the four
samples were 144° (a), 146° (b), 150° (c), and 150°
(d), highlighting the prominent hydrophobicity. Figure 3e shows the contact angle curve of four Ni
sheets. This trend implies that the hydrophobic properties increased
gradually with increasing plating time; particularly, the contact
angles of the samples prepared in 1.5 and 2 h reached 150°, which
locates these materials in the superhydrophobic range.

of nickel samples prepared with different
plating times (a) 0.5 h, (b) 1 h, (c) 1.5 h, and (d) 2 h. (e) Contact
angle of the nickel sample varies with different plating times.

On the contrary, the contact angle of a smooth,
FAS-modified Ni
surface was only 115°, while the contact angle of the FAS-modified
carbonized walnut was 150° (Figure 4). Numerous studies have confirmed that the
surface roughness of material is closely correlated to its hydrophobicity.13 The CA of the solid surfaces of the hydrophobic
materials would increase if they are rough, i.e., a superhydrophobic
surface can result from the increase of the roughness of the hydrophobic
surface.14 Because our Ni sheet was synthesized
using a walnut mold, its pillarlike structure mimics the wood’s
porosity and is able to effectively repel water.

both after FAS modification.

2.3 Microstructure of the Prepared Nickel
Figure 5a shows an
SEM image of the Ni surface prepared using a plating time of 0.5 h.
Two main sizes of vertical columnar structures were distributed on
the sample’s surface. The larger columnar bulges had diameters
of approximately 145–200 μm and were sparsely distributed
on the surface, while small columnar bulges were densely distributed,
with a mean diameter of 8–12 μm and a pore wall thickness
of approximately 1 μm, as shown in Figure 5e. Note that the size and shape of the bulges
on the Ni surface are consistent with the natural hollows in the walnut
wood shown in Figure 1. This indicates that Ni electroplating was able to accurately replicate
the porous structure of the natural walnut wood. Figure 5e also shows that the small-diameter
columnar structures had uneven heights and that most columnar structures
were hollow and tubular. We reasoned that these particular elements
play an important role in imparting hydrophobicity, as indicated by
the high overall contact angle of 144°, for the faculty to mimic
walnut wood’s air-trapping ability.

Figure 5 Microstructures of surfaces
of the nickel samples prepared with
different plating times: (a, e) 0.5 h; (b, f) 1 h; (c, g) 1.5 h; and
(d, h) 2 h.

Figure 5a–d
shows low-magnification SEM images of nickel sheets prepared using
electroplating times of 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 h, respectively, and proves
that the complementary structure of the natural walnut template was
accurately replicated (Figure 1). The high-magnification SEM images in Figure 5e–h help us evaluate the effects of
electroplating time on microstructure and hydrophobicity. The cylindrical
structures kept developing, and the walls of the tubes became thicker
as the electroplating time increased. However, we observed that the
ends of the tubes tended to gradually close for electroplating times
longer than 1.5 h (Figure 5g,h), yielding convex columnar structures. The tops of the
columns were observed to be rough, which is beneficial to the hydrophobic
properties. In summary, we observed that the microstructure of these
Ni sheets changed with variations in electroplating time, which, in
turn, determines the hydrophobic properties.

2.4 Adhesion
Force of the Nickel Surface
To measure the dynamic water-repelling
ability of the Ni surfaces
at room temperature, 2 μL water droplets were contacted, pressed
on, and detached from the four samples (Figure 6a). When the droplets were pressed on the
Ni surfaces, they were observed to undergo three dynamic processes:
shrinking, spreading, and bouncing. Eventually, the water droplets
were completely detached from the sample, leaving a clean, liquid-free
surface. Then, the adhesive force (AF) of each Ni sheet was measured
using an electronic balance. We obtained the AF values of 13.1, 12.4,
11.4, and 11.3 μN for the samples electroplated for 0.5, 1,
1.5, and 2 h, respectively, which helped verify that the surfaces
have low absorbable adhesion. Moreover, AF decreased gradually with
increasing electroplating time, in accordance with the trends in hydrophobicity.
As shown in Figure 6b, we also measured the roll-off angle of the nickel sample prepared
with a plating time of 1.5 h to verify its superhydrophobic properties.
The angle was approximately 6.9°, indicating excellent hydrophobicity.

3 Summary
In this study, we proposed a method
to synthesize superhydrophobic,
morph-genetic Ni using walnut wood as a porous template. By means
of electroplating, Ni sheets with complementary structures and similar
sizes to the walnut wood molds were obtained. After removing the carbon
template by aerobic calcination and modifying the Ni sheets with FAS,
we characterized the obtained materials to evaluate the correlation
between their hydrophobicity and morphology. We observed that the
pores of the carbon skeleton led to the formation of bulges on the
Ni sheets. Larger bulges, with a diameter of 145–200 μm,
derived from Ni intercalation into large wood pores, while smaller
bulges (8–12 μm) duplicated the smaller pores. SEM images
showed that the size and distribution of the columnar protuberances
on the Ni surface were basically consistent with the pore structure
of walnut wood. Additionally, the surfaces of these Ni samples exhibited
excellent hydrophobicity and low water adhesion after FAS modification.
In other words, the porous structure, and the resulting hydrophobicity,
of walnut was accurately and efficiently mimicked and used to improve
the morphology and performance of the nickel sheets. This approach
provides a feasible and straightforward route to prepare superhydrophobic
metal materials imitating the microstructure of natural plants.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of Ni Sheets
Walnut wood
was first pyrolyzed in Ar atmosphere at 1000 °C for 1 h, with
a heating rate of 2 °C min–1, to prepare a
carbonized walnut skeleton; according to a previous study on biomorphic
superhydrophobic materials, this procedure allows wood to act as a
more suitable template: during pyrolysis, cellulose decomposes, leaving
a carbonized walnut skeleton with good electric conductivity, which
can be used as a negative pole in electrochemical cells.15 Then, carbonized walnut was cut into 10 mm3 cubes and abraded using 800 grade silicon carbide paper.

Figure 7 shows the
synthetic procedure that we adopted to obtain porous Ni sheets. First,
a carbonized walnut template was dipped in a NiCl2 solution
(nNi2+ = 0.5 mol L–1) and electroplated as the cathode. A nickel plate was used as the
anode. The current density of electrodeposition was 0.1 A cm–2, and the reaction time varied from 0.5 to 2 h. Ni was able to grow
on the wall of the pore during electroplating and gradually formed
a porous coating, complementary to the mold. Then, the plated sample
was placed in a muffle furnace and calcined at 1000 °C for 1
h in air to remove the carbon skeleton, yielding a structure characterized
by hollow Ni pillars. Finally, the Ni sheet was soaked for 6 days
in a mixture of fluoroalkyl silane (FAS, F-1060) and isopropanol to
modify. As a result, this electrodeposition technique yielded a superhydrophobic
Ni sheet with a complementary face.

hydrophobic nickel sheet.

4.2 Characterization
The surface morphology
of the sheets was observed by a scanning electron microscope (Quanta
250FEG, Fisher Scientific). An X-ray diffraction spectroscope (D8
Advance, Bruker, Germany) was used to identify the materials’
crystal phases at a scan rate of 6° min–1 and
a step size of 0.02°. An energy-dispersive spectroscope (X-Maxn
80, Oxford Instruments, United Kingdom) was used to analyze the chemical
elements on the samples’ surfaces. The superhydrophobic properties
and the dynamic water-repelling abilities were characterized by contact
angle measurements (JC2000D2, Shanghai Zhongchen Digital Technology,
China) with 2 μL water droplets. The adhesive force of the surfaces
was measured using an electronic balance.
