Several nickel(II) complexes of cyclams
bearing aryl groups on
the carbon backbone were prepared and evaluated for their propensity
to catalyze the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO
and/or H+ to H2, representing the first catalytic
analysis to be performed on an aryl–cyclam metal complex. Cyclic
voltammetry (CV) revealed the attenuation of catalytic activity when
the aryl group bears the strong electron-withdrawing trifluoromethyl
substituent, whereas the phenyl, p-tolyl, and aryl-free
derivatives displayed a range of catalytic activities. The gaseous-product
distribution for the active complexes was determined by means of controlled-potential
electrolysis (CPE) and revealed that the phenyl derivative is the
most active as well as the most selective for CO2 reduction
over proton reduction. Stark differences in the activity of the complexes
studied are rationalized through comparison of their X-ray structures,
absorption spectra, and CPE profiles. Further CV studies on the phenyl
derivative were undertaken to provide a kinetic insight.

Introduction
Electrochemical reduction
of CO2 to give reduced carbon
fuel sources has been extensively studied over the last several decades
as a possible route to a renewable carbon fuel cycle.1−6 Although the ideal solution would be to employ a light-driven system
analogous to photosynthesis, electrocatalysis is a simpler surrogate
for convenient evaluation of catalyst candidates, and it can easily
be incorporated in a renewable energy scheme, given that the injected
electrons are derived from renewable sources such as photovoltaics,
wind turbines, and so forth.4 Many transition-metal
complexes have been shown to reduce CO2, producing predominantly
CO and formate as the reduced carbon products. The majority of these
systems feature heavy-metal active sites such as Re,7−9 Ru,10−14 Ir,15,16 or Pd,17,18 and many exhibit
low tolerance under aqueous conditions, preferentially producing H2 in these cases. Nonetheless, many notable examples of CO2 reduction/activation by 3d metal complexes have appeared
in recent years. Savéant and co-workers have demonstrated that
the introduction of phenol substituents in Fe-tetraphenylporphyrin
improves the efficiency of reduction of CO2 to CO dramatically.19−21 More recently, copper porphyrin immobilized on a carbon paper was
found capable of reducing CO2 to hydrocarbons.22 Berben and co-workers have studied the selective
reduction of CO2 to formate using [Fe4N(CO)12]− in great detail.23−25 Guan and co-workers
have investigated the reduction of CO2 to methanol by borane
with Ni and Fe pincer complexes as catalysts.26,27 Kemp and co-workers investigated CO2 capture using both
main group metal complexes28,29 and frustrated Lewis
pairs30 and more recently the reduction
of CO2 to CO using a Zn(II) electrocatalyst.31 Li and co-workers reported photoreduction of
CO2 to CO catalyzed by CoIII(cyclam) immobilized
on titania.32 Remarkable efficiency of
CO2 reduction catalyzed by cobalt porphyrins embedded in
covalent organic frameworks was recently disclosed by Lin and co-workers.33

Of the earth-abundant transition-metal
catalysts, Ni(cyclam) (cyclam
= 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane) is the most active for the production
of CO from CO2 and compares favorably even with its fourth
and fifth row organometallic competitors.5 Furthermore, Ni(cyclam) and many of its derivatives display selective
production of CO over H2 even under purely aqueous conditions.
For nearly two decades, the CO2 reduction capabilities
of Ni(cyclam) and its analogues were almost exclusively studied with
a Hg working electrode, with a surface-bound NiI species
assigned as the putative active catalytic species.34,35 Use of a toxic Hg working electrode has been pervasive despite early
observations by Fujihira and co-workers that a catalytic wave can
indeed be observed at a more environmentally benign glassy carbon
electrode.34,36,37 Although the earlier work by Fujihira did not establish the identity
of the reduction products for a glassy carbon working electrode, Froehlich
and Kubiak recently verified that CO is the major electrolysis product
via controlled-potential electrolysis (CPE) coupled with the gas chromatographic
analysis of headspace gases.38 A litany
of derivatives was prepared and evaluated by Fujita and co-workers
with a Hg electrode, and these derivatives largely consisted of different
degrees of methylation along the carbon backbone of the macrocycle.35 Nonetheless, no method was developed that allowed
for simple, systematic functionalization of the macrocycle backbone.35,37

Derivatization of the catalyst through substitution on the
macrocycle
is advantageous in tuning electronic as well as steric parameters
for the binding and reduction of CO2. Prior to this work,
functionalization of the cyclam ligand was achieved through N or C
substitution of the ring backbone.35,37,39,40 It was shown that the
CO2 reduction activity diminishes with an increasing degree
of N-alkylation.41 On the other hand, certain
C substitutions of the tetraazacyclotetradecane ring have resulted
in enhanced activities.35 In this work,
we present several derivatives with pendant aryl groups on the macrocycle,
allowing for facile tuning of the sterics and electronics of the catalyst
by a change of the substituent on the aryl groups. To our knowledge,
no aryl-substituted derivatives of Ni(cyclam) have ever been analyzed
for their propensity to reduce CO2 and/or H+ electrocatalytically, and the complexes studied with a glassy carbon
electrode have been limited to the work of Froehlich and Kubiak with
Ni(cyclam) and its N-di- and tetramethyl derivatives.38

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
The synthesis of complexes 1–3 (shown in Scheme 1) began with a modular approach adapted from the literature
procedures
to construct aryl-substituted cyclams with functional group flexibility.42−44 The desired aryl moieties can be installed simply through the use
of the appropriate substituted benzylideneacetone, of which a large
variety is accessible through the aldol condensation of the corresponding
benzaldehyde derivative with acetone. Cyclization is then achieved
by the reaction of benzylideneacetone with ethylenediamine to give
the diimine macrocycle. In some cases, the monohydroperchlorate salt
of ethylenediamine is used to prevent undesired side reactions, forming
the macrocycle as the dihydroperchlorate salt. Reduction of the imine
bonds by NaBH4 gives dimethyl, diaryl cyclam derivatives
in a reasonable yield. These ligands readily bind Ni(OTf)2 after a simple reflux in EtOH to yield the corresponding Ni complexes.
Although 1 has been previously reported as NO3– and ClO4– salts,452 and 3 represent
novel Ni(cyclam) derivatives, though L2 is also a known
complex.43 Nevertheless, despite the wide
variety of substituted Ni(cyclam)2+ species analyzed by
Fujita and co-workers, no aryl-substituted Ni(cyclam)2+ has ever been evaluated for its ability to catalyze the reduction
of CO2. To further understand the effect of aryl groups
on the catalytic activity, aryl-free dimethylcyclam complex 4 was synthesized through adaptation of literature procedures.46 The ClO4– salt
of complex 4 has been shown to reduce CO2 at
a Hg electrode,47 but its activity at a
glassy carbon working electrode has not been established, and thus, 4 serves as a useful point of comparison in running parallel
analyses with 1–3.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Complexes 1–4
Molecular Structures
X-ray quality single crystals
were grown via slow diffusion of Et2O into a solution of 1 in MeCN and slow diffusion of hexanes into a solution of 2 in EtOAc. Their molecular structures (shown in Figures 1 and 2) revealed significant structural heterogeneity, despite a
high degree of constitutional homology. Surprisingly, the addition
of a methyl group on the periphery of the macrocycle appears to have
a profound effect on the ligand conformation of the coordinated Ni
complex. Although 1 displays canonical trans-III, RRSS
geometry that is ubiquitous among Ni(cyclam)2+ derivatives, 2 displays boatlike trans-I, RSRS conformation.37 Furthermore, 1 demonstrates substantial
affinity for axial ligands and seems to prefer an octahedral coordination
geometry, as crystals of 1 grown from an EtOH/hexane
mixture were found to have axially coordinated triflates (see Figure
S7 in Supporting Information) despite the
low donicity of the triflate ion. By contrast, 2 does
not adopt H2O or triflates as axial ligands when grown
from EtOAc, and attempts to grow a crystal from a MeCN solution were
unsuccessful, only resulting in the formation of a yellow oil. Notably,
the solution color of 2 is yellow even in coordinating
solvents such as MeCN or MeCN/H2O mixtures. As established
previously, octahedral Nicyclam bis-halo and bis-solvento
complexes are blue-violet, whereas the square-planar complexes are
yellow-orange.48−51 The combined effects of ring conformation and increased electron
density due to the tolyl group give the Ni center in 2 an apparent preference for a square-planar rather than an octahedral
coordination geometry, whereas 1 clearly prefers octahedral
coordination. The effects of the increased electron density provided
by the tolyl group are also evident in the Ni–N(cyclam) bond
distances of 1 and 2. The coordinated MeCN
molecules for complex 1 have relatively short Ni–N
bond lengths [2.107(2) Å], indicating that the axial interactions
are nearly as strong as the coordinated amines of the macrocycle itself
[2.093(2) and 2.080(2) Å]. Complex 2 has significantly
shorter Ni–N bond lengths (1.92 Å on average) as the macrocyclic
amines bond more strongly to stabilize the NiII center
in a square-planar setting where it is not supported by any axial
ligand.

A crystal of 3 suitable for X-ray analysis was obtained
through slow evaporation of a concentrated solution of the complex
in 20% aqueous MeCN, and its molecular structure (Figure 3) was strikingly different
from the structures of 1 and 2. Complex 3 adopts an unusual cis-V, RRRR macrocycle conformation, which
is typically only observed with a bidentate supporting ligand.52 In this case, one H2O and one MeCN
act as the fifth and sixth ligands to give the Ni center an octahedral
coordination environment. The Ni–Ncyclam bond lengths
of 3 are slightly longer than those of 1, reflecting weaker donation when the ligand is functionalized with
the electron-deficient −CF3 groups. The Ni–NMeCN and Ni–O bond lengths [2.125(2) and 2.131(2) Å,
respectively] are also slightly longer than the Ni–NMeCN bonds observed for 1 [2.107(2) Å]. Complex 3 again highlights the sensitivity of the macrocycle conformation
toward substitution. The structure of 4 has been reported
previously as the Cl– salt and displays the conventional
trans-III macrocycle conformation.53 As
the triflate salt, 4 was isolated as an orange solid
and gives an orange solution in MeCN, indicating the lack of axial
triflate or solvent coordination.

Ultraviolet–Visible (UV–Vis)
Absorption Spectra
Given the established relationship between
the solution color and
coordination geometry of Ni(tetramine) complexes discussed above,
visible-light absorption spectroscopy is an effective method for probing
the solution geometry of these complexes. In solution, Ni(cyclam)
complexes exist in a spin-state equilibrium between the diamagnetic,
square-planar conformation and the octahedral, paramagnetic conformation,
where the population of each state is affected by several factors
such as solvent, counterion, and electrolyte concentration.51 UV–vis absorption spectra were collected
for 1–4 in a 20% aqueous MeCN solution and are
shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 UV–vis
absorption spectra of 1–4 in
20% aqueous MeCN.

As expected, there is
a clear difference between the UV–vis
spectra of the complexes that are purple as solids (1 and 3) and those that are yellow-orange (2 and 4). Complexes 2 and 4 exhibit prominent peaks at 453 and 456 nm, respectively, corresponding
to the d–d band of the square-planar conformation in the diamagnetic
spin state. This peak is completely absent from the spectra of 1 and 3. By contrast, the spectra for complexes 1 and 3 exhibit d–d bands at 497 and 523
nm, indicative of an octahedral geometry and a high-spin, paramagnetic
state. All four complexes have a second absorption peak between 329
and 339 nm, which corresponds to the d–d transition of the
octahedral, high-spin species, although for 1 and 3, this band is more intense relative to the d–d bands
at longer wavelengths. Thus, it can be concluded that, whereas all
of the complexes have at least minor contributions from the high-spin
state, only 2 and 4 show an appreciable
population of the diamagnetic state.

Solution Voltammetry
As shown in Figure 5, the cyclic voltammograms of 1–4 all display
distinct behavior despite their structural homology.
Subtle differences in the macrocycle substitution lead to significant,
somewhat counterintuitive differences in the Ni-based reduction potentials
under Ar. Each complex displays a single one-electron cathodic peak
as well as a single one-electron anodic peak (see Figure S8 in Supporting Information for the background scans
under Ar and CO2). These waves are assigned as the NiII/I and NiII/III couples. Whereas the NiII/III process is reversible for all complexes, the NiII/I transition
is reversible for 1, 2, and 4 but not 3. Curiously, the trend in reduction potentials
does not seem to match the intuition that, in a set of analogous complexes,
the species bearing the most electron-withdrawing substituent will
have the least negative reduction potential under Ar as it is more
readily reduced at the cathode. Accordingly, 3 should
have the least negative reduction potential by virtue of the electronegative
trifluoromethyl groups. Complex 1 would be the next most
electron-deficient because of the phenyl groups, and complexes 2 and 4 would be the least electron-deficient
of the series and are expected to have similar reduction potentials
because the donicity of a methyl substituent on the aryl group will
somewhat counteract the inductive electron-withdrawing effect of the
aryl group, causing little net change in the expected reduction potential.
Instead, the opposite trend is observed; 3 has the most
negative reduction potential followed by 1, then 4, and finally, 2 has the least negative NiII/I potential of the series. Clearly, the expected electron
deficiency of the macrocycle is not the only factor governing these
NiII/I reduction potentials, and a delicate interplay between
the geometry and strength of the axial ligands, which could potentially
be triflate, MeCN, or H2O under these conditions, likely
explains this deviation. The differential donation strength of these
ligands is expected to affect the NiII/I potentials of
the complexes and likewise their reactivity toward CO2 because
of the variation in the reducing strength of the NiI complex.
By contrast, the NiII/III potentials do follow the intuitive
trend: the oxidation potentials shift anodically as the macrocycle
becomes more electron-deficient, with the most positive NiII/III potential observed for 3, followed by 1, 2, and finally 4.

Figure 5 Cyclic voltammograms
of 1.0 mM solutions of 1–4 in a 0.08 M solution
of Bu4NPF6 in 20% aqueous
MeCN, purged with Ar (solid trace) or CO2 (dotted trace).

Although the cyclic voltammograms
under Ar for these otherwise
similar complexes are surprisingly disparate, the effect of macrocycle
substitution is even more pronounced when the voltammograms are recorded
under a CO2 atmosphere. As shown in Figure 5 (dotted traces), complexes 1, 2, and 4 all display a similar behavior
for the NiII/I couple under CO2; the reversible
redox couple under Ar is completely irreversible under CO2, with a substantial increase in the cathodic peak current. This
increase in current, referred to as the “catalytic current”
under CO2, is indicative of an electrocatalytic reaction,
as significantly more current is passed than would be expected for
a simple one-electron reduction of the NiII center. By
contrast, the current for the NiII/I couple does not increase
appreciably for complex 3, implying that no catalytic
process takes place under CO2. The lack of activity of 3 is likely due to the irreversible nature of its reduction
under Ar; the product of the reduction of 3 simply may
not be stable enough to bind and reduce CO2 appreciably.
Complex 2 has a distinctive profile under CO2, in which the catalytic current is approximately 3 times the current
under Ar, and only one sharp peak is visible. Complexes 1 and 4 have a similar threefold increase in current
at the NiII/I potential; however, at more negative potentials,
a second, distinct cathodic peak is observed in the cyclic voltammograms.
This second peak suggests that a different catalytic process is accessible
at more negative potentials under CO2, which could be assigned
as reduction of H+ to H2 because of acidification
of the aqueous media caused by saturation with CO2 or could
possibly be a different catalytic pathway for the reduction of CO2. Others have reported this “second peak” in
similar systems, but its origin is still not completely understood.36,38 Additionally, the cyclic voltammogram of complex 1 under
CO2 in neat acetonitrile (Figure S9 in Supporting Information) does reveal an irreversible NiII/I couple with current comparable to that recorded under
Ar, indicating the absence of catalytic activity without water or
other proton source.

As shown in Figure 6, catalytic currents for the NiII/I couple are of nearly
identical magnitude for the three active electrocatalysts 1, 2, and 4. Although no further catalytic
current is observed at more negative potentials for 2, the current increases steadily to a second catalytic peak for 1 at more negative potentials, and the “peak”
for the NiI/II couple is not well-resolved and appears
more as a shoulder. For 4, the current after the first
catalytic peak dips slightly before increasing steadily to a second
catalytic peak. This difference in profile suggests that for 1, the shoulder and the “second” catalytic peak
may be representative of a single catalytic mechanism or pathway for 1, whereas the clear resolution of the first and second catalytic
peaks for 4 suggests that these two peaks represent distinct
mechanisms and/or product pathways in operation for 4 at these different peak potentials. As can be seen in Figure 6, complex 1 clearly
is the most active of the three electrocatalysts, with the catalytic
peak current almost twice that for complex 4. In fact,
complex 1 reaches the peak current of complex 4 (∼120 μA) at a potential over 200 mV less negative
than the potential for the second catalytic peak of 4, and 1 maintains a higher current between the first
and second catalytic waves than 4. These observations
clearly indicate that 1 is the most active catalyst of
the series under these conditions, making 1 the natural
candidate for further cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies discussed in
detail later.

CPE
Although the
cyclic voltammograms shown in Figures 5 and 6 clearly establish the
electrocatalytic activities of 1, 2, and 4 under CO2, the composition of the reduction products
cannot be established
through this method. To truly evaluate the activity of these complexes
for the conversion of CO2 to reduced carbon products, CPE
coupled with headspace gas analysis was performed by use of a gas-tight
electrochemical cell described elsewhere.54 Although glassy carbon electrodes are convenient for use in small
electrochemical cells, CPE cells often necessitate large, porous electrodes
to achieve a complete and efficient electrolysis of the analyte. In
this study, a reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) disc was selected
as the working electrode for the CPE experiments. The potential was
held at −1.7 V versus Fc+/Fc for each complex, which
is slightly more negative than that of the NiII/I couple
of 2 and slightly less negative than those of the NiII/I couples of 1 and 4. After 30
min of electrolysis, the headspace was sampled and injected directly
into a gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector (GC–TCD)
to identify and quantify the gaseous products present. When electrolyses
were performed at more negative potentials, H2 production
directly from the RVC electrode surface dominated the current response
prior to the addition of the catalyst; as a result, the current response
and product distribution upon catalyst addition could not be adequately
resolved from this “background” activity of the working
electrode. Unfortunately, this precluded further analysis of the second
catalytic wave that appears beyond −2.0 V. Table 1 shows the gaseous product distributions
for 1, 2, and 4, as well as
their Faradaic and catalytic efficiencies.

In agreement with its
cyclic voltammogram under CO2, 1 is the most
CO-producing catalyst. Complex 2 is the least active
of the series and displays poor selectivity
for the reduction of CO2 over H+. The total
charge passed by 2 is comparable to the total charge
passed by a solution without a catalyst present, which suggests that
much of the current and H2 observed during the electrolysis
of 2 may be due to direct reduction on the RVC electrode
surface. Complex 4 actually appears to be selective for
the reduction of H+ and produces much less CO in comparison.
The amount of charge passed during the electrolysis of 4 is much higher than the charge passed during the electrolysis of
the blank solution; hence, it is reasonable to conclude that 4 is truly selective for H2 production rather than
CO. In addition to the high catalytic activity, complex 1 is also the most selective for CO production, with 80% FE for CO
and only 7% for H2. Complex 1 is the only
complex which completes multiple turnovers of CO2 to CO
during the electrolysis period, establishing true catalysis. In comparison, 2 and 4 reduce CO2 quite sluggishly
and produce less than 1 equiv of CO per mol catalyst during the electrolysis
period. Likewise, only 4 reduces H+ to H2 catalytically, with 1 and 2 producing
sub-stoichiometric quantities of H2, most of which is likely
to be generated directly on the working electrode surface. The reactivity
of 4 highlights the importance of the electrode material
for this family of catalysts as the perchlorate salt of 4 was previously found to be highly active for CO production at a
Hg electrode, forming a negligible quantity of H2 in this
case.47 Because the outcome of CPE experiments
may vary significantly depending on the setup of the electrolysis
cell and the nature of the working electrode, the catalytical activity
of Ni(cyclam)Cl2 was examined under conditions identical
to those used for 1, 2, and 4, yielding FEs of 35 and 66% for CO and H2, respectively
(the detailed results are provided in Table S1 in the Supporting Information). Clearly, 1 is a far better catalyst than Ni(cyclam)Cl2 in terms
of both the selectivity and turn-over number for CO production under
the same conditions. It should be noted that the quantity of H2 produced during the electrolysis of 1 is commensurate
with the H2 production by the blank solution and likely
stems directly from the working electrode.

This dramatic difference
in the catalytic profile is somewhat unexpected
for these otherwise similar systems, though some insight can be gained
from the analysis of their CPE behaviors. Notably, 1 is
the only catalyst that is purple in the pre-electrolysis solution,
whereas 2 and 4 are yellow. After the completion
of electrolysis, the solution color is unchanged for 1, whereas 2 and 4 gradually develop a green
color over time. Opening the cell to an ambient atmosphere, or applying
a potential of 0 V to the cell, causes this green color to dissipate
rapidly, suggesting that this green species is a reduced Ni complex,
probably NiI. Furthermore, there is a concomitant decrease
in the current for 2 and 4 as the green
color develops, whereas the current stays nearly constant for 1 after a short induction period. These observations suggest
that 2 and 4 lose the catalytic activity
during the reaction and cannot be cycled properly as they are “trapped”
in a NiI state that is somehow deactivated. Complex 1 does not seem to suffer the same fate, as the solution color
remains unchanged throughout electrolysis, and multiple catalytic
turnovers are achieved. Froehlich and Kubiak have demonstrated that
Ni(cyclam) becomes inhibited as [CO] increases during electrolysis,
forming the inactive [Ni(cyclam)(CO)]+ adduct that cannot
continue catalytic cycling.55 Given that
[Ni(cyclam)]2+ displays this same “yellow-to-green”
solution behavior during electrolysis, it is reasonable to conclude
that CO binding is a major degradation pathway for 2 and 4 but does not appreciably affect 1. We are continuing
to explore the fundamental reasons for this apparent improvement in
the catalytic efficiency of 1 relative to Ni(cyclam)2+, 2, and 4, but at present, we
suggest that the electron deficiency of 1 relative to 2 and 4 is the predominant cause. CO is usually
found as a ligand for low-valent metals, often forming M0(CO) complexes preferentially. Thus, we postulate that CO might prefer
the more electron-rich derivatives 2 and 4, and 1 could be at an ideal level of electron deficiency
such that the NiI species is sufficiently electron-rich
to bind and reduce CO2 but not electron-rich enough to
bind CO strongly and thus inhibit catalysis. A second rationale, which
does not invoke CO binding, can be proffered on the basis of the UV–vis
spectra of the complexes. Although 1 is present in solution
as the high-spin octahedral species under these conditions, the vast
majority of 2 and 4 are present as the square-planar,
diamagnetic species, with only minor contributions from the octahedral
state. Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that upon reduction to
NiI, orbital rearrangement must occur from the square-planar
state to allow for binding of CO2 as a fifth ligand for 2 and 4, whereas 1 circumvents this
energy barrier and allows for ligand exchange between CO2 and the octahedral species. Indeed, the square-planar conformation
may be totally inactive in these complexes, and the observed activities
of 2 and 4 may originate only from the minor
population of the octahedral high-spin state that is observed in solution
under these conditions.

Kinetics Study Based on CV
The CPE
results are both
less informative on reaction rates and hard to be compared with other
published results because of the differences between the electrolytic
cells and conditions. On the other hand, CV has been shown to be a
powerful tool to yield accurate kinetic data and mechanistic insights
for electrocatalysis by many groups, especially those of DuBois on
H+ reduction56 and Berben57 and Fujita on CO2 reduction.35 Inspired by these successful investigations,
a series of CV experiments have been carried out to further investigate
the kinetics of the best catalyst, 1.

First, a
series of CVs were recorded with the scan rates (ν) varying
from 0.005 to 0.045 V s–1 under an Ar atmosphere
(Figure 7a). It is
clear from Figure 7b that the current density for the NiII/I couple increases
linearly as a function of ν1/2, indicating not only
a reversible electron transfer but also a diffusion-controlled, one-electron
redox reaction.58 This linearity also signals
the absence of catalytic activity during the time scale of the CV
experiment under Ar. Hence, H2 evolution only occurs on
longer time scale experiments such as CPE, which even then only produces
H2 with a FE of 7%.23,57 The linear relationship
can be further analyzed according to the Randles–Sevcik equation
(eq 1), where, at 25
°C, Jp is the current density (A
cm–2), n is the number of electrons
transferred (n = 1), D is the diffusion
coefficient for 1 (cm2 s–1), and C is the bulk concentration of 1 (mol cm–3). Using the slope of Jp versus ν1/2, the diffusion coefficient
for 1 was found to be 4.7 × 10–5 cm2 s–1.58 1

aqueous MeCN under Ar at varying scan rates (0.005–0.045
V s–1) and (b, bottom) plot of Jp vs ν1/2 for 1.

The current density dependence on the scan rate
was also studied
under a CO2 atmosphere (Figure 8), which allows for the use of eq 2 to determine the rate constant, kcat (mol–1 cm3 s–1), for the entire catalytic reaction, assuming that
the overall catalytic reaction is second-order.57 2  Jcat and Jp are the current
density of the Ni-based reduction
under CO2 and Ar (A cm–2), respectively, n is the number of electrons required for the catalytic
reaction (n = 2), R is the gas constant
(8.314 J K–1 mol–1), T is the temperature (298 K), F is Faraday’s
constant (96485.3 C mol–1), ν is the scan
rate (V s–1), and the concentration of CO2 is 0.00019 mol cm–3.55

Top) Plot of Jcat/Jp vs ν–1/2 for 1 under
CO2 and (b, bottom) CVs of 1 in 0.08 M Bu4NPF6 of 20% aqueous MeCN under CO2 with
scan rates ranging from 0.010 to 0.04 V s–1.

A linear dependence of Jcat/Jp on ν–1/2 is clear
from Figure 8a, and
the slope therein can be used to determine kcat. The calculated kcat, a second-order
rate constant, was found to be 2.754 M–1 s–1 (2.754 × 103 mol–1 cm3 s–1). The turn-over frequency (TOF) was estimated
to be 0.523 s–1 (1884 h–1, [CO2] = 0.19 M) based on kcat using eq 3. 3  

The bimolecular nature of the overall reaction is validated
by
CV studies wherein the catalyst concentration (Figure 9) and the CO2 concentration (Figure 10) were varied separately.
As shown in Figure 9a, the catalytic current density increases linearly with increasing
[1]. Similarly, a linear relationship exists between
the catalytic current density and [CO2]1/2 (M–1/2, Figure 10a). These linear relationships are indicative that the catalytic
reaction is first-order with respect to the concentration of 1 and half-order with respect to the CO2 concentration.57 4

0.1 V s–1. The concentration of CO2 delivered
to the CV cell was
controlled by the outlet pressure of the gas regulator and balanced
with Ar gas, maintaining a pressure of approximately 1 atm. The CO2 and Ar gases were mixed in a round-bottom flask for 15 min
before the mixture was purged through the CV solution for 15 min.

Conclusions
In summary, a series of C-aryl-substituted
Ni(cyclam) derivatives
have been synthesized through adaptation of literature procedures,
providing a facile route to derivatization of the macrocyclic ligand.
These complexes are the first aryl derivatives of Ni(cyclam) to be
evaluated for their ability to reduce CO2 catalytically.
Similar to Ni(cyclam), complexes 1, 2, and 4 do not require a Hg electrode for activity and allow the
use of environmentally benign carbon working electrodes. Electrochemistry
of these complexes demonstrated that the electron-withdrawing substituents
on the aryl group deactivate the Ni center toward reduction of CO2 and H+, whereas the other derivatives display
surprisingly disparate levels of catalytic activity, with the phenyl
derivative 1 demonstrating the highest activity for CO2 reduction. The dramatic increase in the CO2 reduction
activity for 1 over 2 and 4 may be tentatively attributed to the differential CO binding at
the NiI state and/or differential population of the high-spin
octahedral and diamagnetic square-planar states in solution, and our
efforts are ongoing to verify and elucidate the nature of these interactions.
Further CV studies of 1 under various reaction conditions
reveal that the electrocatalytic reaction is first-order with respect
to the catalyst concentration and half-order with respect to the CO2 concentration.

Experimental Section
General Procedures
Ketone precursors for L1–L3 were synthesized
according to the literature procedure and further
purified by vacuum distillation at 90 °C and 100 mTorr.59L1,43 4,14-dimethyl-7,12-diphenyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradeca-4,14-diene,42L2,43 and 4,14-dimethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradeca-4,14-diene dihydroperchlorate46 were prepared according to literature procedures.
All reagents were used as received. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance
(1H NMR) spectra were obtained with a Varian Mercury300
NMR instrument, with chemical shifts (δ) referenced to the residual
solvent signal (CHCl3 at 7.27 ppm). UV–vis spectra
were obtained with a JASCO V-670 spectrophotometer. Gas chromatography
data were collected on an Agilent 7890A instrument with a TCD and
an HP-Molsieve column (length = 30 m, diameter = 0.320 mm, and film
thickness= 12.0 μm). Electrospray mass spectra were obtained
as electrospray in a positive-ion mode with the aid of a Waters Micromass
ZQ4000 instrument. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded at a scan rate
of 100 mV s–1 on a CHI620A voltammetric analyzer
with a glassy carbon working electrode (diameter = 2 mm and area =
0.0314 cm2), a Pt wire auxiliary electrode, and a Ag wire
reference electrode filled with 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 in MeCN. Potentials were referenced to a ferrocene internal standard
added to the solution at the end of data collection. CPEs were performed
with a CHI620A voltammetric analyzer with a Duocel RVC disc (porosity
= 100 ppi, diameter = 200 mm, and thickness = 5 mm) as the working
electrode, a graphite rod anode, and an Ag wire reference electrode
filled with 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 in MeCN. The concentration
of the analyte was always 1.0 mM.
