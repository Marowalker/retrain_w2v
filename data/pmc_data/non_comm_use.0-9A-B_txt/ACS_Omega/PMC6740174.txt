γ-Cyclodextrin
metal–organic frameworks (γCDMOF)
recently emerged as biofriendly, highly porous, and crystalline materials
with potential applications in drug delivery. However, little is known
about their drug entrapment and release characteristics, which are
key parameters in the design of drug carriers. The macroscopic properties
of a material are determined by its microstructure. Thus, the characteristics
of the constitutive units of the cubic crystalline γCDMOF determine
their drug loading and release behaviors. In this study, the release
profile of prednisolone (PNS) form γCDMOF was predicted, and
the mechanism was analyzed based on the γCDMOF molecular structure.
For the first time, experimental, molecular simulation, and mathematical
modeling methods were combined to gain insights into the drug distribution
in cubic porous crystals of γCDMOF as well as on drug release
kinetics. The predicted release profile was in good agreement with
the experimental results, showing that the modeling method was reliable.
The methodology developed here could provide a reference for further
investigations of drug penetration and release in supramolecular systems.

1 Introduction
γ-Cyclodextrin
metal–organic frameworks (γCDMOF)
are porous crystalline materials represented by the formula K2(C48H80O40)(OH)2, composed of γCD and K+ and OH– ions giving rise to electrostatic interactions. The crystal cell
parameters are a = b = c = 31.006 Å and α = β = γ = 90.00° (Figure 1).1 The regular architecture of γCDMOF made of large
pores and channels attracted the interest of researchers in an attempt
to optimize their synthesis1 and develop
applications in the fields of gas storage2 or drug delivery.3

Drug loading and release characteristics are the most evaluated
parameters for the development of novel drug delivery carriers. However,
no attention has been paid yet to loading/release mechanisms of γCDMOF,
leaving it scientifically untouched topic. An impregnation method
is commonly used for drug loading in γCDMOF, but it requires
long periods of time (up to 18 h3). The
scientific reasons for such long impregnation times despite the highly
porous interconnected structure of γCDMOF are still unclear.
Therefore, there is a high interest to explain the drug loading mechanism,
which would speed up this very particular research field. Molecular
modeling is a useful tool to provide insights into the molecular level
on the release mechanism of this new drug delivery system.

In
the crystal structure of γCDMOF, the macrocycles of γCD
adopt the faces of a cube, with their primary faces pointing toward
its interior (Figure 1). The γCDs are linked to one another by coordination of the
alkali metal cations to the primary C-6–OH groups and the oxygen
atoms of the glycoside ring. An approximately spherical pore (namely,
chamber), with a diameter of 1.7 nm, resides at the center of the
cube.1 Invited molecules access the structures
through 0.78 nm windows defined by the inner diameter of each dual
γCD unit, forming infinite channels, which propagate along the
tridimensional network.4 This regular structure
of dual γCD units plays a crucial role during the drug loading/release
processes.1 Moreover, docking experiments
allowed detecting stronger interactions between the drug and the repeated
dual γCD structure units in γCDMOF as compared to monomeric
γCDs. In the light of important role of dual γCD structure
units (D-γCD) in the structure, the molecular models of D-γCD
and single γCD (S-γCD) were considered in present research.

This study focused on the loading of prednisolone (PNS) in γCDMOF,
and the solvent of ethanol (EtOH) was selected, considering the fact
that γCDMOF is unstable in water. Usually, the spherical5 or cylindrical6 models
were used to predict the release characteristics, and the diffusion
coefficient was often calculated according to the complex free-volume
theory.7 In this paper, a cubic model was
used for the first time to predict the release characteristics, and
the diffusion coefficient was derived from the molecular simulation
results. At the same time, the distribution of the drug in the cubic
body was determined. This study could provide a deep understanding
of the drug loading/release mechanism and new ideas for designing
CDMOF formulations.

2 Results and Discussion
The size of γCDMOF particles can be controlled from several
micrometers to hundred micrometers. A batch of γCDMOF with a
size of 150–250 μm was selected for experimental measurement
and demonstrated the simulation. The loading efficiency of PNS to
γCDMOF was about 1% (w/w), namely, 1:28 as the molar ratio between
PNS and γCD, which is far less than a saturated status as a
molar ratio of 1:2. Thus, the drug loading did not affect the study
of the specific location of PNS in γCDMOF. In this paper, the
crystalline characteristics and relevant properties were characterized.
The XRD results in Figure 2 showed that the crystal structure did not been destroyed
during all the process.

complex PNS−γCDMOF.

2.1 FTIR Spectra
The FTIR spectra of
PNS, γCDMOF, and the drug-loaded complex (PNS−γCDMOF)
had been obtained (Figure 3) to provide more information for molecular modeling.

Figure 3 FTIR spectra
of free drug, empty γCDMOF, and drug-loaded
γCDMOF. (a) PNS−γCDMOF. (b) γCDMOF. (c) PNS.

The stretch vibration band of —C=O
in PNS at 1654.5
cm–1 was detected in the γCDMOF, confirming
the presence of the drug in the particles (Figure 3). The symmetrical stretch vibration band
of −CH2–/–CH– in γCDMOF
at 2854.9 cm–1 disappeared (Figure 3). This is an indication that PNS molecules
interacted with all the γCDs in the γCDMOF and not only
with the surface of the crystals.8 However,
FTIR could not provide more insights into the drug-loaded crystal
structures. Therefore, in an attempt to clarify the specific location
of PNS molecules, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation
methods were employed.

2.2 Docking Results
The docking program
was used to search for the most probable binding site in the periodic
cavity (the hollow of γCD)/chamber (the hollow of γCDMOF)
structures of the entire crystal. The docking results, based on the
crystal structure characteristics of γCDMOF, showed that the
PNS molecule preferred to stay in the hydrophobic cavity of the D-γCD
channel of γCDMOF rather than in the large chamber of the γCDMOF
(Figure 4). According
to this distribution pattern, the molar ratio of PNS and γCD
could reach as high as 1:2 if all the cavities of the D-γCD
structure were occupied. This conclusion was based on the crystal
structure characteristics of γCDMOF not on the real drug-loading
concentration.

position
of γCDMOF according to the docking result. Blue, PNS; other,

The only possible way of drug
penetration during loading or release
was through the channels formed by the D-γCD structure. The
cavity structure of D-γCD opposed a relatively higher resistance
to the drug passage as compared to the chamber. Indeed, an obtained
docking free energy of about −8.6 kcal·mol–1 indicated that the steric hindrance of loading/release was relatively
larger, and the drugs were most likely to stay here. Therefore, there
were two benefits to study the interaction dynamics here. First, the
dynamic parameters could be obtained by the dynamic simulation for
the speed limit position, and the global drug loading/release characteristics
could be predicted. Second, more detailed information on specific
interactions could be obtained. In view of the two benefits, the D-γCD
and S-γCD configurations were extracted out of the global crystal
structure to perform PMF calculation with PNS, and the two models
were compared.

2.3 Potential of the Mean Force
(PMF) Profile
and Apparent koff
Due to the
instability of γCDMOF in water, drug release studies were carried
out in EtOH. To be consistent with this release process, the calculation
of the PMF profile was based on the model of PNS and D-/S-γCD
in EtOH solution (Figure 5). The aim to study both S- and D-γCD models was to
evaluate the difference of the γCDMOF model. This might also
help us understand the nature of their interaction.

Figure 5 MD models of PNS with
(a) S-γCD and (b) D-γCD.

In this study, we used the same methods as our early work9 to calculate the overall unbinding rate constant k–r in the second stage and the apparent
dissociation rate constant koff. Here,
we only state the PMF profile of PNS with S- and D-γCD (Figure 6) and provide the
results of the k–r and koff (Table 1).

Figure 6 Binding free energy profiles obtained from ABF calculation
for the inclusion
of PNS into (a) D-γCD and (b, c) S-γCD (two cases). The
blue curves represent the binding free energy profile along the binding
pathway, and the light blue segments represent the predictive error
of the profile.

Table 1 k–r and koff Data of
PNS–D-γCD
and PNS–S-γCD Systems
system	k–r (×104 s–1)	koff (×104 s–1)	
PNS–D-γCD	4.49 ± 3.96	4.49 ± 3.96	
PNS–S-γCD	(1.43 ± 1.13) × 107	 	
Several conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of Figure 6. First, the PMF
profile and the calculated ΔG between PNS–S-γCD
and PNS–D-γCD systems were quite different. In the S-γCD
system, PNS easily accommodates without the need to penetrate through
the narrow entrance, which has the largest resistance during binding/unbinding,
as it is the case with the PNS–D-γCD system. Indeed,
due to the symmetric characteristics of the D-γCD system, PNS
has inevitably to go through the narrow entrance during loading and
release, which leads to the absolute values of the docking free energy
of the D-γCD system that were much higher than those of the
S-γCD system.

From the calculated results, this gap was
also quite obvious (Table 1). The different structures
between S- and D-γCD lead to the interaction mechanism, and
the effect (k–rs of PNS–D-γCD
and PNS–S-γCD systems were (4.49 ± 3.96) ×
104 s–1 and (1.43 ± 1.13) ×
1011 s–1, respectively) was more different.
As a result, the S-γCD was not fit for being directly used as
the simplified model of γCDMOF. In the following, we mainly
investigate the D-γCD model. In view that it was difficult to
determine the binding/unbinding rate constant of the D-γCD structure
in γCDMOF via experiment, it was more reliable to verify the
calculation results by comparing the release behavior.

2.4 Drug Release Dynamics
The aim of
this study was to model drug release by determining the variation
of drug density (d) with time (t) in γCDMOF. The ability of γCDMOF to retain the drug
within their porous structure was related to their crystal size (l) and koff, which was the diffusion
limiting parameter. Considering the repetitive structure of the cubic
γCDMOF crystals, the drug release process of γCDMOF could
be regarded as an isotropic continuous diffusion process of a cube
loaded with drugs. Thus, it was assumed that (i) the drug concentration
outside the drug-loaded crystal was very low as in sink conditions
and (ii) the γCDMOF particles were solid cubic crystals with
an edge length of l and an initial drug density of
unit 1. D is defined as the diffusion coefficient
of drug in γCDMOF. Thus, the mathematical description of the
system was (eq 1): 1  

This equation was defined
in the region delimiting the 3D γCDMOF cube in the Cartesian
coordinate. The analytical solution could not be resolved directly.
Therefore, we used the numerical solution here. A particle size of l = 2 × 10–3 dm was used as the average
crystal size. The diffusion coefficient D can be
determined according to the following method:10 Let the length of the unit cell of γCDMOF to be a. The difference of concentration between the two adjacent chamber
was Δc. The difference of total quantity was a3·Δc. In view of
the rate of drug passing D-γCD much slower than its diffusion
rate in solvent (in the chamber), the D-γCD is the rate limiting
unit. Therefore, the diffusion rate into the adjacent chamber was a3·Δc·koff, and the average concentration gradient
of two adjacent chambers was Δc/a. According to the definition of the diffusion coefficient, the following
equation (eq 2) could
be obtained: 2  

Thus, D = a2·koff was used as the diffusion coefficient where a2 = (31.006 × 10–9)2 dm2. To assign it (t = 15 min,
35 min, 1 h, and 3 h; k = 44941 × (31.006 ×
10–9)2 L·mol–1·dm2), the concentration distribution of drug along
the straight line, which passed through the body center and was perpendicular
to one face, could be drawn in the following figure (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Relative density distribution
of drug in the cubic crystal along
the straight line, which passed through the body center and was perpendicular
to one face at different times (t).

To show the distribution landscape of the drug in the cubic
crystal
more directly and intuitively, the distribution maps (t = 30 min) of drug concentration in the cubic crystal under the sink
conditions are depicted in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Distribution map of drug density in the cubic crystal
under the
sink conditions at t = 30 min. (a) In the crystal
body. (b) In the cross section, which passed through the body center
and paralleled to one face. (c) In the cross section, which passed
through the point of l/4 and paralleled to one face.

The predicted drug release profiles were obtained
by integrating
the drug density function (d) in the whole crystal
and gathering the relative release content (Figure 9). This profile was compared with the experimental
data showing a good agreement (correlation coefficient = 99.92%).
This supports our hypothesis, proving that the calculated positions
and distribution during release of PNS in γCDMOF were accurate.

Figure 9 Comparison
of the theoretical release profile with experimental
data.

The orange dispersed symbols depicted
the experimental values (Exp.)
and the error bars. The blue line depicted the calculated values (Cal.).
The three independent experimental values at each time point have
been divided by their respective c(∞), the
drug concentration (c) when t =
+∞. Since the drug was totally released after 12 h, the concentrations
around t = 12 h were used as surrogate to c(∞).

2.5 Analysis of the Hydrogen
Bond (Hbond) and
van der Waals (VDW) Force
Based on the above comparison of
experimental and predicted data, the reliability of the calculation
results and mathematical modeling were confirmed. Therefore, the model
has been further used to explore more in detail the interaction between
PNS and γCDMOF. The MD results showed that Hbond played an important
role in the whole adsorption/release processes and provided a relatively
large contribution to the free energy of the system. Either PNS interacted
with S- or D-γCD systems, VDW force only played a supporting
role. The solvent was EtOH with a relative weak polarity; thus, there
was little tendency for PNS to enter into the hydrophobic cavity of
γCD. Therefore, there were few hydrophobic interactions between
PNS molecules and the hydrophobic CD cavities. However, some polar
groups in the system played a relatively important role (Figure 10).

PNS with D-γCD.

2.6 Mutual
Confirmation of the Structure
The conformation of PNS and
γCDMOF in the minimum energy state
was determined. Figure 11a shows the conformation after energy minimization. Figure 11b shows the docking
result after energy minimization. It could be seen from Figure 11 that the two conformations
were almost the same. This result was another confirmation of the
validity of the method used for the calculation of free energy.

3 Conclusions
In this
study, the apparent dissociation constant, koff, of the model drug PNS from γCDMOF was predicted
by molecular simulation. The approximate location of the drug in γCDMOF
was identified using FTIR and molecular docking. In addition, a mathematical
model was established to predict the drug release profile based on koff, which was in good agreement with the experimental
measurement. It was concluded that the koff of PNS from the dual γCD as the molecular structure unit of
MOF was the primary parameter to control both the PNS distribution
within γCDMOF particles and the drug release profiles from γCDMOF.
The methodology developed here provided a reference for further investigation
of the drug release mechanism in supramolecular systems as well as
other complex crystalline drug delivery systems.

4 Methods
and Materials
4.1 Calculation Method
4.1.1 Molecular Models
The crystal structure
of γCDMOF was extracted from the single-crystal structure of
MOF-1 in the literature.1 The receptor
of docking used the crystal cell unit by deleting the K+ and OH– ions. The S-/D-γCD structures were
extracted from the crystal structure of γCDMOF. The molecular
structure of PNS was extracted from the single-crystal structure of
PNS obtained from the Cambridge Structural Database (Refcode: JIWPEL).
The molecular models of PNS, S-γCD, and D-γCD are depicted
in Figure 12. Then,
an energy optimization in vacuum employing the Amber 12 program was
performed. During the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the glycosidic
oxygen atoms of γCD were coerced to their initial position using
a soft harmonic restraint to ensure the axis of γCD parallel to the z axis. Because γCD has
a rather rigid skeleton in γCDMOF, it can be regarded as a rigid
body,11−13 and thus, harmonic restraints should not significantly
affect the flexibility of γCD. For hydration of the model, an
EtOH box confined by a period boundary condition was added to the
simulation system. The initial size of the EtOH box was about 52 ×
53 × 102 Å3 in all the systems studied.

4.1.2 Molecular
Docking
The AutoDock
Vina 1.1.214 was used to obtain the rough
position of PNS in γCDMOF. Then, the docking result with the
relatively low energy was performed the energy optimization with γCDMOF
fixed. A Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA) in combination with a
grid-based energy evaluation method were used for precalculating grid
maps according to the interatomic potentials of all atom types present
in the host and guest molecules, including the Lennard-Jones potentials
for van der Waals interactions and Coulomb potentials for electrostatic
interactions. A grid map of dimensions 70 Å × 70 Å
× 70 Å, with a grid spacing of 0.375 Å, was employed
to cover the γCDMOF structure. With the help of AutoDockTools,15 the atomic partial charges were calculated by
the Gasteiger–Marsili method.16 The
parameters used for the global search were an initial population of
50 individuals, a maximal number of energy evaluations of 1,500,000,
and a maximal number of generations of 50,000 as an end criterion,
and other docking parameters were set as default.

4.1.3 Molecular Dynamics Simulations
All the MD simulations
were performed using the parallel package
of NAMD 2.6 with the general amber force field (gaff).17 The AmberTools in Amber 12 was used to prepare
the Amber starting stuffs. The Gaussian 09 package was used to calculate
partial atomic charges of PNS and EtOH molecules for the force field.
The force field of γCD was extracted from the glycam force field
website18 in which the partial script was
modified. The EtOH model was built manually as the solution model.19 The particle mesh Ewald (PME) method was used
for the treatment of long range electrostatic interactions. The nonbonded
cutoff was set to 15.0 Å. A time step of 2.0 fs was used to integrate
the equations of motion. The temperature was maintained at 310 K,
employing Langevin dynamics with a damping coefficient of 1 ps–1. The Nosé–Hoover Langevin piston was
used to control the pressure at 1 atm, with a piston period of 100
fs, a damping time constant of 50 fs, and a piston temperature of
310 K.

4.1.4 Free Energy Calculations
In the
molecular systems, the heavy atoms of γCD form
the first subset of atoms. All the atoms of PNS formed the second
subset of atoms separately. The pull originations were all along the z axis. The free energy profiles along an appropriate ordering
parameter, ξ, describing receptor-ligand binding were generated
using the adaptive biasing force (ABF) method. Next, the free energy
was determined by integrating the average force acting along ξ,
obtained from unconstrained MD simulations.20−23 To keep the central cavity of γCD centered about the z axis during
the MD simulations, the glycosidic oxygen atoms were restrained by
means of weak harmonic restraints with a force constant of 1.0 kcal·mol–1·Å–2. Prior to each ABF
run, the compound and their EtOH medium were equilibrated over a period
of 20 ns. The reaction pathway was broken down into some consecutive
windows with 2 Å wide. Over 20 ns of sampling was generated in
each window. Instantaneous values of the force were accrued in bins
0.1 Å wide. One thousand samples were accumulated in each bin
prior to application of the adaptive bias. The average force was interpolated
over eight adjacent bins and progressively applied along ξ by
means of a linear ramp. To improve uniformity of the sampling along
ξ and continuity of the average force across adjacent windows,
the width of the windows was adapted wherever needed. The standard
error of the free energy difference was estimated using three parallel
samples.

4.2 Experimental Method
4.2.1 Materials
PNS (50-24-8, Dalian
Meilun Biotech Co., Ltd.) and γCD (17465-86-0,
Maxdragon Biochem Ltd.) were of pharmaceutical grade. Potassium hydroxide
(KOH, 85.0%, analytical reagent grade), methanol (MeOH, 99.5%, analytical
reagent grade), EtOH (99.7%, analytical reagent grade), formic acid
(high-performance liquid chromatography grade), and acetonitrile (high-performance
liquid chromatography grade) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Pure water (18.4 MΩ cm)
used in all experiments was obtained using a Milli-Q system (Millipore,
Milford, MA, USA).

The γCDMOF particles were synthesized
as previously described using a vapor diffusion method.4,24 Briefly, γCD (162 mg, 0.125 mmol) and KOH (56 mg, 1 mmol)
were dissolved in 5 mL of water followed by MeOH vapor diffusion at
ambient temperature over 40 h. The produced γCDMOF with a size
of 150–250 μm were selected as our drug loading vehicles.

4.2.2 FTIR Analysis
Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of samples (γCDMOF
and PNS–γCDMOF) were obtained using
an FTIR spectrometer Thermo (Nicolet iS5, Thermo Scientific, USA).
Briefly, the sample and potassium bromide were thoroughly mixed with
a mass ratio of 1:10 and then compressed into a disk. Scans were obtained
in the region of 400–4000 cm–1 at a resolution
of 4 cm–1.

4.2.3 Drug
Loading Experiments
The drug
was loaded in γCDMOF by impregnation. For this, PNS was soaked
in previously dried γCDMOF powder (50.0 mg) suspended into 10.0
mL of EtOH containing the drug (5.0 mg·mL–1). The suspension was incubated at 300 K under gentle stirring (150
rpm). The drug-loaded γCDMOF samples were collected by removing
the EtOH solution when the drug concentration in supernatant was constant.

4.2.4 Drug Release Experiments
Drug release
was performed using the paddle method by means of a dissolution apparatus
(ZRS-8G, Tianjin Halylda Tech Co., Ltd.). About 15 mg of drug-loaded
samples were added to the dissolution media containing 100 mL of EtOH
at a temperature of 310 ± 0.2 K (n = 3). The
solutions were stirred at a speed of 150 rpm. Aliquots of samples
(0.5 mL) were withdrawn from each vessel at predetermined time points
(18, 35, 60, 180, 360, and 720 min) and filtered over a cellulose
acetate filter of 0.22 μm. At each time point, the same volume
of fresh medium maintained at the same temperature was added to dissolution
media. Samples withdrawn from the dissolution medium were analyzed
for drug content by HPLC. All experiments were carried out in triplicate.

4.2.5 Concentration Determination by HPLC
The
PNS concentration in the release media was determined by HPLC
using a C18 column (4.6 mm × 150 mm, 3.6 μm i.d., Agilent
Co., Ltd) at the flow rate of 0.6 mL·min–1 at
298 K. Eluent A was 0.1% formic acid, and eluent B was acetonitrile.
The gradient started with 10% B increasing to 90% within 10 min and
maintained for 3 min, and then the eluent B decreased to 10% in 1
min and then kept unchanged for 6 min. The injection volume and detection
wavelength were 50 μL and 240 nm, respectively.
