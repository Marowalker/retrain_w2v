High luminescence intensity from materials that are excited by
external stimuli is highly desired. In this work, a stretchable hybrid
luminescent composite (HLC) that has multiple luminescence modes is
reported. The luminescence can be excited either by externally applied
mechanical strain or by a moving object that slides against the HLC.
When the HLC is deformed, such as being twisted or folded, the ZnS/Cu
phosphor experiences mechanical strain that trigger the mechanoluminescence
(ML) of the phosphors. Moreover, as the HLC slides against a contact
object, the triboelectrification at the contact interface induces
the electroluminescence of phosphor. Here, a series of internal and
external factors were studied on how they influence the luminescent
intensity. It is found that the luminescent intensity from the two
modes can be superposed. The HLC material was used to fabricate a
fiber-based luminescent device that can be driven by air flow. The
overall luminescent intensity is enhanced by over 72% compared to
that obtained solely from the ML. The HLC reported in this work has
such potential applications as self-powered light sources and sensors
as means of detecting dynamic motions and interaction.

Introduction
Methods for converting mechanical energy into light emission are
promising for use in illumination,1 displays,2 and stress sensors.3,4 Conventionally,
strain-induced luminescence, which is also known as mechanoluminescence
(ML), is the most common method for achieving such energy conversion.5,6 For example, Jha and Chandra reported the impulsive excitation of
the ML in SrAl2O4:Eu2+ and Dy3+ phosphors.7 However, this mechanism
has several limitations that affect its practical applications. First,
the high-intensity ML materials are usually inorganic materials,8 such as quartz,9 rare-earth
ion-doped aluminates,10 and doped zinc
sulfide.11 To generate ML, their large
Young’s modulus results in a high threshold pressure at the
scale of several MPa.12,13 Second, the ML is usually accompanied
by the material damage and the decay of the luminescence intensity,
which affect ML’s reproducibility.14,15 Recently, novel triboelectrification-induced luminescence (TIEL)
that could convert kinetic energy into light emission was reported.16 The TIEL exhibited an exceptionally low threshold
that was 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than the conventional
ML. It also possessed high luminescence intensity. If the TIEL and
the ML could be achieved in a single material, significant luminescence
intensity from the mechanical–optical conversion can be achieved.

In this work, we report a stretchable hybrid luminescent composite
(HLC) that could generate both ML and TIEL under different mechanical
stimuli. The HLC possessed two luminescence modes. The luminescence
could be excited either by externally applied mechanical strain or
by contacting objects that interact with the HLC. On the one hand,
when it was deformed, such as being twisted or folded, the ZnS/Cu
phosphors experienced mechanical strain that triggered the ML of the
phosphors. On the other hand, as the multilayered composite luminescent
material contacted with an external moving object, the triboelectrification
at the contact interface induced electroluminescence of the phosphors.
A series of internal and external parameters were investigated on
how they influenced luminescent intensity for each of the modes above.
It was found that the luminescent intensity from the two modes could
be superposed. We used the HLC material to fabricate a fiber-based
light source that could be driven by air flow. The overall luminescent
intensity was enhanced by over 72% compared to that obtained solely
from the ML. The HLC reported in this work has such potential applications
as self-powered light sources and sensors as means of detecting dynamic
motions and interaction.

Results and Discussion
The schematic diagram of the HLC is shown in Figure 1a. The HLC basically consisted of a phosphor
and a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix; and polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE) nanoparticles were added into the top layer of the HLC. The
cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) view of the HLC
is presented in Figure 1b, which clearly shows a two-layered structure. The ZnS/Cu phosphor
was well dispersed in the PDMS matrix that was used for transferring
externally applied stress to the particles. The magnified view in Figure 1c presents the distribution
of the PTFE nanoparticles within the HLC. These particles play two
roles. In addition to reducing the friction coefficient between the
HLC and a contact object, they also enhanced the triboelectrification
between the contact surfaces because the PTFE strongly attracts negative
triboelectric charges.17,18 The magnified SEM image of the
phosphor is shown in Figure 1d. The ZnS/Cu phosphor has a diameter of ∼26 μm.
It is a commonly used material that could be excited by either mechanical
stress19−22 or a charging electric field.23−25 The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
show that the phosphors have a wurtzite structure (Figure S1). A photograph of the as-fabricated HLC is shown
in Figure 1e. A diagram
of the experimental setup used for spectral measurement is presented
in Figure 1f. An optical
fiber-based probe collected the optical emission from the back of
the HLC. The detailed fabrication process is discussed in Methods.

from the HLC.

The HLC has two basic luminescence modes for the mechanical–optical
conversion, as illustrated in Figure 1g–j. The first mode is based on the ML. The
luminescence can be induced by applying a mechanical force to the
HLC. When stretched, the ZnS/Cu phosphor produces ML (Video S1). The fundamental mechanism of the ML
process has been extensively studied in the literature.26,27 Basically, the strain-induced electric field of the charged dislocations
causes band bending of the ZnS crystal. As a result, the electrons
trapped in the shallow donor level tunnel to the conduction band.
When the excited electrons of the Cu2+ ions fall back to
the t2 level of the Cu2+, photons
are emitted (Figure S2).26 A photograph of the ML as the HLC was being stretched is
presented in Figure 1h. For the second mode, if a contact object slides on the top surface
of the HLC, the phosphor underneath the sliding trajectory can also
produce luminescence [Figure 1i,j, Video S2]. This type of luminescence
is referred to as TIEL, as previously reported.16 Essentially, the TIEL relies on the coupling of triboelectrification
and electroluminescence. When a relative sliding occurs between two
dissimilar materials, surface charge transfer takes place due to the
triboelectrification effect. The surface triboelectric charges generate
a transient electric field along the sliding trajectory, exciting
the phosphor underneath. As indicated by the discussion above, the
HLC can produce light emission when triggered by multiple types of
stimuli.

In the following sections, the two luminescence modes are investigated
in detail, especially on respective influencing factors. First, the
major factors that influence the TIEL are investigated in Figure 2. On the one hand,
the two parameters regarding the design of the material are shown
in Figure 2a,b, that
is, the PTFE concentration and the overall thickness, respectively.
As the content of the PTFE nanoparticles increased, the luminescence
intensity initially increased and then decreased, resulting in an
optimal weight percentage at 7.0%. The luminescent intensity was enhanced
by over 300% compared to that obtained from the luminescent composite
without PTFE nanoparticles. This finding shows that the addition of
the PTFE nanoparticles do promote the triboelectrification between
the two contacting surfaces. However, it was found that excessive
PTFE nanoparticles reduced the transparency of the HLC, which blocked
the luminescence from transmitting through the HLC. We also fabricated
one-layered HLC and bilayered HLC. The overall thickness of the one
and two layer structure is the same, which is about 0.33 mm. The content
of PTFE nanoparticles in the one-layered HLC and the first layer of
bilayered HLC was 6.98 wt %. There were no PTFE particles in the second
layer of the bilayered HLC. The TIEL of the one-layered HLC and bilayered
HLC was measured at a velocity of 10 mm/s and a stress of 25 kPa,
as shown in Figure S3. The TIEL intensity
of the bilayered HLC is over twice that of the one-layered HLC. Soon,
Jeong et al. reported one-layered ML devices.20,28 Wang et al. reported a multilayered ML device using the polyvinylidene
fluoride film to enhance ML intensity.29 Wei et al. reported a multilayered TIEL device using ZnS/Cu particles
as a luminescent layer and fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) film
as an electrification layer.16 However,
the device is not stretchable. The advantage of the bilayered HLC
is that the bilayered HLC can integrate ML and TIEL. The bilayered
HLC also show higher luminescence intensity than the one-layered HLC
when they were driven by the same mechanical stimulus. In addition,
the overall thickness of the HLC could also affect the luminescence
intensity with constant thickness of the first layer. As the thickness
increased from 0.28 to 1.53 mm, the luminescence intensity decreased
substantially by over 90% of the original value. This can be intuitively
explained by the fact that increasing the thickness prevents the emitted
light from escaping through the HLC. On the other hand, another two
parameters regarding how the contact object interacted with the HLC
were also examined, as shown in Figure 2c,d. The luminescence intensity was found to be very
sensitive to the applied pressure at the contact interface (Figure 2c). Indeed, as the
pressure increased from 5 to 40 kPa (velocity, 80 mm/s), the luminescence
intensity was enhanced by a factor of 6.5. This enhancement is attributed
to the fact that high contact pressure favors the generation of high-density
triboelectric charges.30 As a result, a
high electric field can be obtained to excite the luminescence. As
the pressure surpassed 40 kPa, the luminescence intensity tended to
saturate because the triboelectric charges density reached a maximum
limit (Figure S4).31 Besides, as shown in Figure 2d, the velocity of the sliding object exerted a profound effect
on the luminescence intensity (stress, 20 kPa). Similar observation
was also reported in previous research.16 Higher sliding velocity essentially increased the equivalent frequency
of the changing electric field,32 which
benefited the electroluminescence of the phosphor.

spectra with increasing the HLC thickness. (c) Luminescence spectra
as the stress at the contact surfaces varies from 5 to 40 kPa. (d)

Second, a number of factors influencing the ML were investigated
with experimental results shown in Figure 3. A linear motor was adopted to apply a periodic
stretching strain to the HLC. The strain rate substantially influenced
the luminescence intensity. The ML intensity had a positive linear
correlation with the strain rate, as shown in Figure 3a. This observation was consistent with previous
reports.20 When the average strain rate
increased from 139 to 451%/s, the ML intensity increases by approximately
377% (the initial length of the HLC is 7 mm). Detailed observations
on the peak wavelength revealed that the ML spectrum shifted slightly
to shorter wavelength as the strain rate increased. This is attributed
to the activation of different energy levels of the ZnS/Cu phosphor,
as reported previously.28 Shown in Figure 3b, the peak wavelength
shifted from 519 to 513 nm. Besides, the applied strain was also positively
correlated with the luminescence intensity, as exhibited in Figure 3c. The luminescence
intensity increased by about 3.5 times when the strain increased from
28.6 to 128.6%. The maximum principal stress is proportional to the
strain of the film.33 In addition, larger
HLC thicknesses resulted in higher luminescence intensities. The luminescent
intensity increased by about 5.6 times when the thickness of the HLC
changed from 0.28 to 1.53 mm, as shown in Figure 3d. This is because that more phosphors were
involved in the ML process when the thickness of the HLC increased.
Then, more generated emissions could be obtained during the same detection
time of the spectrometer.

and (b) peak wavelength with increasing the externally applied strain
rate. (c) ML spectra under different strains of the HLC. (d) Dependence
of the ML spectra on the thickness of the HLC.

Based on the two luminescence modes discussed above, a wind-driven
luminescent device was fabricated, in which the TIEL and the ML could
be superimposed to promote the overall luminescence intensity. We
fabricated two kinds of HLC with and without embedded PTFE particles
on the surface. The HLC were sliced into fibers with a width of ∼1
mm and a length of 3.5 cm. The fibers were rolled up around a gas
tube at one end, leaving the other end of the fibers free-standing.
There is no significant difference in the luminous intensity between
two kinds of HLCs, as shown in Figure S5. The devices showed little TIEL. It is because PTFE and PDMS are
very close in the triboelectric series.34 There were little transferred surface triboelectric charges between
the layer with PTFE particles and the layer without PTFE particles.
Then, we fabricated two types of fibers. As illustrated in Figure 4a, the device was
composed of two types of fibers bundled together. The first type had
a core–shell structure. The core was based on the HLC, and
the shell was made of parylene coating with a thickness of 2 μm
[Figure 4b(i)]. This
shell material not only served as a protective coating that promoted
the mechanical robustness of the HLC-based fiber against external
stimuli but also acted as an electrification material that generated
and retained the triboelectric charges. Another type of the fibers
was made of plain FEP, as shown in Figure 4b(ii). FEP is transparent and then will not
prevent the emitted light from being transmitted to the spectrometer.
It is a good triboelectrically negative material.35 Much surface triboelectric charges could be generated on
the parylene-coated HLC, which could generate TIEL. The device was
fabricated through assembling the two types of fibers together at
one end and leaving the other end of the fibers free-standing. The
photograph of the mixed fibers is shown in Figure 4b(iii). To trigger the luminescent device,
air flow was introduced from the assembled end along the length of
the fibers, as revealed in Figure 4c. Excited by the air flow, the mixed fibers fluttered
violently, producing high-intensity luminescence, as shown in Figure 4d. The luminescence
comes from two sources. First, the strain incurred within the HLC-based
fibers generates ML of the phosphor. Second, the contact between the
FEP fibers and the HLC-based fibers induced the TIEL. As the air flow
pressure increased, the luminescence intensity became significantly
enhanced (Figure 4e).
This observation was supported by the experimental data presented
in Figure 4f. If the
FEP fibers were removed, the HLC-based fibers alone produced a luminescence
intensity that was 42% lower than that produced by the hybrid fibers.
This is because that the HLC-based fibers mainly generated the ML
with few TIEL.

Conclusions
In summary, in this work, a stretchable bilayered luminescent composite
is developed based on combination of strain-induced luminescence and
TIEL. The composite film embedded with green light-emitting doped
ZnS particles exhibits two luminescence modes. The luminescence can
be excited either by externally applied mechanical strain or by contacting
objects that interact with the HLC. The surface triboelectric charges
resulting from the sliding motion generate a charging electric field
along the sliding trajectory, thereby exciting the underlying phosphors.
The low-pressure threshold (5 kPa) of the electroluminescence implies
that these devices have wide applications. Furthermore, a gas flow
system was presented to simulate the effect of wind, and increasing
the air compressor discharge pressure was found to increase the luminescence
of the composite film. The luminescent intensity collected from the
device decreased after elimination the TIEL of the device. This study
demonstrates the potential applications of this HLC in self-powered
light sources.

Methods
Fabrication of the Stretchable HLC
The stretchable
HLC studied here had a two-layered structure. In the first layer,
ZnS/Cu particles (Shandong Wanji, M-G-AAA) were mixed with the mixture
of PDMS and curing agent (10:1 weight ratio, Dow Corning 184) at a
weight ratio of 2:1. The mixed solution was spread over an acrylic
plate covered with scotch tape and smoothed with a plastic card. After
curing at 80 °C for 1 h, the second layer was spun onto the mixture.
The spun speed for the prepared second layer was 2000 rpm (SETCAS
Electronics, KW-4B). This second layer consisted of ZnS/Cu particles,
PDMS matrix, and PTFE nanoparticles (DuPont). The ZnS/Cu particles
and the PDMS matrix were mixed at a weight ratio of 1:1. The ratio
between ZnS/Cu and PTFE particles changed from 10:0 to 10:3.

Fabrication of the Wind-Driven Luminescent Device
The
wind-driven luminescent device consisted of the FEP fibers and the
HLC-based composite fibers. An FEP film of 100 μm thickness
was cut into 5 cm × 3.5 cm pieces. The FEP fibers were obtained
from partially slicing a FEP piece in which each slice had a width
of ∼1 mm and a length of 3.5 cm. The FEP piece was cut into
fibers by laser (Universal VLS 2.3). ZnS/Cu particles were mixed at
a weight ratio of 2:1 with the PDMS matrix. After curing at 80 °C
for 1 h, the composite material was cut into 5 cm × 3.5 cm pieces.
To obtain the mixed fibers, the HLC was partially sliced the same
as the FEP fibers. Then, the HLC-based fibers were deposited with
a layer of parylene-N coating by vacuum vapor deposition (PDS-2010
Specialty Coating Systems), forming a core–shell structure.
The weight of parylene-N used in depositing was 2 g. The two types
of fibers were bundled together and rolled up around a gas tube that
had an external diameter of 5 mm at one end, leaving the other end
of the fibers free-standing.

Optical Characterization
TIEL measurement: a sponge
(3M 9448A) was cut into pieces with a size of 0.4 cm × 0.5 cm.
A piece of the sponge covered with a layer of nitrile rubber was fixed
on a linear motor (Zolix LMA-TR-200-E10). The covered sponge slid
on the HLC via a linear motor. The applied forces between the moving
object and the HLC were measured by a dynamometer (Mark-10 M5-20).
ML measurement: the HLC was stretched and then released by a linear
motor. A piece of the HLC (7 mm length) was used to measure the ML
spectra of the HLC at different strain rates. The luminescence spectra
of the HLC samples were collected by a spectrometer (Idea Optics NOVA).
The spectrometer probe was located at a constant position. The ML
and TIEL images were captured by a digital camera (Canon EOS 5D Mark
III).
