==== Body
In the original
publication, incorrect informations were given
in the main text and in Figure 2 about the chemical properties of two antibiotics: the sulfamethoxazole
(SMX) and trimethoprim (TRI); however, this does not change the main
conclusions of the study, nor the behaviors of the adsorption of the
antibiotics to the layered materials.

Figure 2 Speciation of the SMX
and TRI antibiotics used in the study. SMX
and TRI are mainly anionic and cationic species at a pH = 6.5,
respectively.

The sulfamethoxazole
displays a pKa couple of 6.16 and 1.97,
respectively, for the strongest acidic
and basic forms. Therefore, between these two pH values, SMX is neutral
and not zwitterionic compound. Summarily, TRI has a neutral character
(and not zwitterionic) above its pKa =
7.16. Thus, the correct speciation diagrams in Figure 2 for SMX and TRI are given here.

At
a pH 6.5 (pH of the study), SMX displays a neutral-anionic behavior
with a ratio of 30/70% whereas TRI is mainly a cation (80%) with neutral
species (20%). This does not affect the main trends nor conclusions
of the study. Nevertheless, in their neutral forms, these antibiotics
can be adsorbed onto the whole layered materials through ion–dipole
interaction (with Brij0.4-Mt, BDTA-Mt, and Na-Mt) and by
weak molecular forces: van der Waals (dispersion, hydrophobic, pi-pi,
...) with the whole organoclays and starting Na-Mt.

The authors
apologize for the errors in the original manuscript
but it was important for us to give these important corrections.
