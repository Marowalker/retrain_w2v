Branched
nanostructures of semiconductors based on one-dimensional heterostructures
have many promising applications in optoelectronics, supercapacitors,
photocatalysts, etc. Here, we report a novel branched core/shell CdO/ZnO
hetero-nanostructure that resembles a Crimson bottlebrush (Callistemon Citrinus) but with intriguing hexagonal
symmetry. The nanomaterials were fabricated via an improved one-step
chemical vapor deposition method and consist of a CdO wire as the
core and ZnO as the shell. With cadmium acting as a catalyst, ZnO
nanowires grow as perpendicular branches from the CdO/ZnO one-dimensional
core/shell structure. The nanostructures were characterized with X-ray
diffraction scanning and transmission electron microscopy. A homogeneous
epitaxial growth mechanism has been postulated for the formation of
the nanostructure. The materials show a broad and strong absorption
ranging from visible to ultraviolet and a better photoelectrocatalytic
properties in comparison to pure ZnO or CdO. Our synthetic strategy
may open up a new way for controlled preparation of one-dimensional
nanomaterials with core/shell heterostructure, which could find potential
applications in solar cells and opto-electrochemical water-splitting
devices.

1 Introduction
Recently,
one-dimensional (1D) core/shell hierarchical hetero-nanostructures
have been explored for applications in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics,
photocatalysis.1−3 Unlike 1D one-component semiconductors, core/shell
hierarchical hetero-nanostructures (or nanocomposite structures) could
combine the advantages of each component material to achieve better
properties synergistically. The core/shell hetero-nanostructures were
demonstrated to enhance separation of the charge, reduce the band
gap, and increase the light absorption range to the visible region,
which cause a better electron–hole pair separation under irradiation
resulting in higher photocatalytic activities.4−9 As examples, 1D ZnS/CdS heterostructures offer higher and ultrafast
photosensitivity in ultraviolet/visible photodetectors.10 Branched ZnS/ZnO heterostructure nanofilms exhibit
broad photoresponses in flexible ultraviolet photodetectors.11 CdS/ZnO core/shell nanofibers show excellent
visible light photocatalytic activity and stability for hydrogen production.12 ZnO@CdS core/shell heterostructures facilitate
the degradation of methylene blue under ultraviolet light irradiation.13

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting
as a class of low-cost, pollution-free renewable energy technologies
has been studied extensively.14−16 As one of the most studied photocatalysts,
TiO2 has a 3.2 eV band gap, high photocatalytic efficiency,
and environment-friendly, stable chemical and physical properties.4,17−19 ZnO has become a potential photocatalyst with a similar
band gap compared to TiO2, but it has higher electron mobility,
has broader absorption of the solar light, is nontoxic, has lower
cost, and is easier to fabricate.20,21 However, the
high rate of electron recombination in ZnO and the strong tendency
of oxidization under UV irradiation lead to oxidative deactivation,
affecting its photoelectric catalytic efficiency and stability.22,23 Although many efforts have been made, such as doping, loading precious
metals, and combining with other semiconductors to improve the efficiency
of photogenerated carriers and extend the spectral response range,
few of them were found effective.24−26 Cadmium oxide nanowire
(NW), as an important semiconductor with a direct band gap of 2.3
eV (also reported as an indirect semiconductor with a band gap of
1.36 eV) and a promising material in application of sensing and flat-panel
displays,27,28 may provide a possible approach to resolve
the above-mentioned problems of ZnO. With well-developed bulk and
epitaxial growth processes, it can be readily prepared and usually
used as a photoanode material in solar cells, sensors, optoelectronics,
and photovoltaic-based PEC water-splitting devices.

Most hetero
(or composite) structures are prepared in two steps. As examples,
1D ZnS/CdS heterostructures10 or ordered
CdS micro/nanostructures on CdSe nanostructures31 were fabricated via a two-step thermal evaporation method;
hierarchical assembly of ZnO nanostructures on SnO2 backbone
nanowires8 or branched ZnS/ZnO heterostructure11 were prepared by a thermal evaporation process
followed by hydrothermal growth; one-dimensional CdS/ZnO core/shell
nanofibers12 were made by spinneret electrospinning.
So far, there are very few report on the fabrication of CdO nanowires,
especially none on the branched CdO/ZnO core/shell heterojunction
nanowires, by simple chemical vapour deposition (CVD) methods.29,30

Here, we report for the first time a novel branched CdO/ZnO
heterogeneous core/shell nanostructure by an improved CVD method.
Unlike other 2-step synthetic methods for core/shell heterostructures,
herein we have developed an improved CVD method by the source-moving
technique to achieve controllable growth of core/shell heterostructure
in one step, which is superior in terms of low cost, high efficiency,
easy fabrication, and structural controllability of the samples of
uniformed morphology in a large scale.

Although there are many
reports related to the core/shell structures, in this work, the CdO/ZnO
core/shell structure is reported for the first time and the epitaxial
growth of 6-fold symmetrical branches was first observed. A plausible
growth mechanism was proposed. The nanomaterials were characterized
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), focused ion beam (FIB)-SEM,
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD).
The results indicate that these nanomaterials have a very good crystallinity,
branched and core/shell structures. The absorption spectra show that
the branched CdO/ZnO heterostructures have a stronger and broader
absorption band from UV to visible and to near-infrared light in comparison
with those of pure zinc oxide and pure cadmium oxide. Moreover, the
CdO/ZnO composite material has a significant increase in current response,
and its PEC performance has been enhanced in both the dark and light
conditions. The hierarchical and the core/shell structures might not
only enhance the capture of light but also provide more surface active
sites due to the large specific surface area. Compared with pure zinc
oxide, the heterogeneous structure may increase the separation of
effective charges, suppress the recombination of electron–hole
pairs, and, therefore, hence improve the activity of photocatalyst,
as further verified by the impedance spectroscopy.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Method
An improved
CVD route32 was used to grow 1D branched
CdO/ZnO heterostructures, where a moving source method was applied
in the typical process, as shown in Supporting Information Figure S1. For a typical procedure, a 7:1 weight
mixture of ZnO (Macklin, 99.9%) and carbon (Tianjin Guangfu, Spectrography
grade) powders were mixed and placed in an alumina boat in the upstream
of the tube. Meanwhile, another alumina boat loaded with CdO powder
(Aladdin, 99.99%) was placed at the center of the furnace in the tube.
The substrate, a silicon wafer coated with a 5 nm thick gold film,
was placed 10 cm away from the center of the furnace at the downstream
side. In the growth process, we used a quartz rod driven by a step
motor through magnetic force to push the boats into the heating zone,
and the pressure in the quartz tube was maintained at vacuum atmospheric
pressure. After purging the system with 99.99% N2 at 120
standard cubic centimeter per minute (sccm) for 5 min, the furnace
was heated to 1080 °C over 50 min and held for 20 min with a
N2 (N2 also acts as carrier gas) flow rate of
90 sccm. Then, the ZnO powder was moved to the center of the heating
zone slowly within 5 min and the temperature of the furnace was reduced
to 1000 °C. After 30 min of growth at 1000 °C, the furnace
was naturally cooled down to room temperature. The branched CdO/ZnO
heterostructures as composite nanowires (NWs) were grown on the substrate
on a large scale. As control experiments, pure CdO nanowires and pure
ZnO nanowires were also prepared via the same procedures (please see
Supporting Information Figure S2).

2.2 Material Characterizations
The as-grown nanomaterials
were characterized utilizing field emission scanning electron microscope
(FE-SEM, Zeiss sigma-HD), microscope X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku
D/Max 2500), and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Titan G2
60-300 with image corrector) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscope. The UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded on
a UV spectrometer (UV-2600).

2.3 PEC Measurements
All the PEC measurements were performed following the literature
procedures6 on an electrochemical workstation
(CHI660E 412841) in a three-electrode system, using a prepared photoelectric
anode as the working electrode, Pt as the counter electrode, and the
standard Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. The photoresponse
of the prepared photoelectrodes was measured under an irradiation
source from a 300 W Xe lamp with the filter VisREF (350−-780
nm). The intensity of the light source is estimate about 150 mW/cm2, and 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution acts as the electrolyte.
Photoelectric responses of photoanode were measured at an applied
potential of −1.15 V vs Ag/AgCl under illumination for light
on–off cycles. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
is measured in the frequency range of 0.01–10 kHz.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Morphology and Structure
Characterization
A typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
image of the pure CdO nanowires (NWs) grown by our improved method
is shown in Figure 1a, revealing that the nanowires have a width of 1–1.5 μm
and a length of over 50 μm. We observed that there were no discernable
catalyst particles at the tip of the nanowires, which may be due to
the fact that the catalyst particles were melted or dropped at high
temperatures. An enlarged view of the CdO nanowires given as an inset
of Figure 1a shows
that the nanowires have a cubic crystal structure. The XRD pattern
of the CdO nanowires are depicted in Figure 1b. The diffraction peaks can be indexed to
crystalline CdO phase, showing that the product matches well with
the cubic phase of CdO with a cell constant a = 0.4695
nm (JCPDS card No. 05-0640). No other peaks are detected in the XRD
pattern, indicating high purity of the product. Figure 1c,d shows the typical TEM images of the CdO
nanowires and the corresponding selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) pattern along the [111] zone axis, respectively, which further
identify the CdO structure as cubic crystals. These results are consistent
with those in the literature33,34 and validate that our
improved method can produce crystalline CdO nano/microwires.

top and side of the as-grown NWs. (b) XRD pattern of the CdO NWs.

The typical low- and high-magnification
SEM images of the branched CdO/ZnO heterostructures are displayed
in Figure 2. In Figure 2a, the low-magnification
image shows that the nanostructures we synthesized are uniform in
a large scale (see Supporting Information Figure S4a), revealing that the Crimson bottlebrush-like (shown in Figure 2c) branched architectures
with a width of about 1.5–2 μm and a length of over 50
μm. It is interesting to note that the branched nanostructures
have a 6-fold symmetry when observed at a high magnification, as shown Figure 2b, and branches consist
of bundles of individual wires with a length of about 9 μm.
It is quite apparent that the branches are oriented at an angle of
90° to the backbone nanostructure. Figure 2d is a typical XRD pattern of this branched
CdO/ZnO heterostructures. It shows the biphase diffraction pattern
of CdO (a = b = 4.695 Å, JCPDS
card No. 05-0640) and ZnO (a = 3.25 Å and c = 5.21 Å, JCPDS Card No. 36-1451) crystals. Cadmium
oxide’s diffraction peaks are stronger than those of zinc oxide’s,
suggesting that in this branched heterostructure, the trunk (i.e.,
the backbone structure) is cadmium oxide wire, whereas the branches
are the zinc oxide nanowires. No new peaks or peak shift are detected
in the XRD, indicating that no significant cross-reaction between
ZnO and CdO occurred and heterostructures with high phase purity were
formed. The relatively strong (111) and (101) diffraction peaks of
CdO and ZnO revealed that the growth of heterostructures may be preferentially
oriented along [111] and [0001] directions, respectively.

SEM images of the single branched CdO/ZnO heterostructures. (c) A

As shown in Figure 2b, there are many particles on the tips of
branched nanowires. Figure 3a–d shows an enlarged view of the tip particles with
the corresponding element distribution mapping. It can be seen that
the tip particles are derived from cadmium (Figure 3d), whereas the branch wires are rich in
zinc, providing the basis for our postulation of the growth mechanism
of the branches. Figure 3e–h shows the FIB-SEM image of the 1D branched CdO/ZnO heterostructures
with the corresponding element distribution mapping. The trunk is
a Cd-rich core, whereas the outer layer is a Zn-rich shell. From the
bright and dark contrast of its cross section, especially viewed from
its top (Figure 3e),
a core/shell structure is clearly visible (more details show in Supporting
Information Figure S5). Based on these
observations, we conclude that the cadmium oxide wires form the core
and the zinc oxide wires form the shell in the CdO/ZnO heterostructures.
And, the ZnO branches as shell are likely to grow by a homogeneous
epitaxial mechanism from the CdO core. These conclusions are further
supported by the TEM results as described below.

view of the top particles in the 1D branched CdO/ZnO heterostructures.

top particles. (e) The FIB-SEM image of the 1D branched CdO/ZnO heterostructures.
(f–h) Elemental distribution of Zn, O, and Cd elements in the
trunk of CdO/ZnO heterostructures.

The branched CdO/ZnO heterostructures were investigated by
means of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).
A typical TEM image of an individual CdO/ZnO branched nanostructure
is shown in Figure 4a, which confirms that the branches are oriented at an angle of 90°
to the backbone nanostructure and the diameters of the zinc oxide
branches (about 200 nm) and cadmium oxide trunk (about 2 μm)
are relatively uniform. It is noteworthy that in the process of transferring
the samples, a certain amount of branches have fractured and broken
off from the backbone. Figure 4b is an enlarged image of the branches, where we can see that
the zinc oxide branches have a width of 180–210 nm and a length
of more than 3 μm. The HRTEM image from the white framed area
in Figure 4b is shown
in Figure 4c. The crystals
exhibit clear lattice fringes with d-spacing of 0.52
and 0.28 nm, which agreed well with the lattice spacing of the (001)
planes and the (100) planes of the wurtzite ZnO crystal structure.
The inset shows the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) pattern, further
proving the branches have a single crystal structure and the preferred
wire growth direction is along the [0001] orientation. Figure 4d is the corresponding SAED
patterns along the [1210] zone axis, further identifying ZnO with
a hexagonal wurtzite structure.

The inset of (f) is the combined elemental distribution mapping of
Cd and Zn elements.

To further analyze the
heterojunction component information, the diagram in Figure 4e–h shows the distribution
of the corresponding elements, where Figure 4e is the high-angle annular dark field (HAADF)
map. Through the central and peripheral contrast of light and dark
in the figure, we could identify the heterogeneity of the growth with
core/shell structures. And, Figure 4f–h reveal the distribution of the constituting
elements O, Zn, and Cd, respectively. Oxygen is distributed uniformly
in the entire space and cadmium and zinc are uniformly distributed
in the trunk and branches, respectively. These results further support
the information that the trunk/core consisting of cadmium oxide and
zinc oxide undergoes epitaxial growth of branches as shell and finally
forms the heterogeneous core/shell branched structure, as is clearly
identifiable in the inset in Figure 4f.

3.2 Postulated Growth Mechanism
This 1D branched core/shell CdO/ZnO heterostructured nanomaterials
were fabricated by an improved CVD technique. The growth process of
this novel structure presented here can be roughly described in three
separate stages, as illustrated in Figure 5. The first stage is the growth of CdO nanowires,
which act as subsequent phase nucleation sites of growths, typically
following the vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) mechanism.35−37 When the furnace increased to the setting temperature, the CdO source
(Aladdin, 99.99%) was started to evaporate into vapor phase at the
center of the tube and the hemispherical gold liquid located downstream
was formed on the Si substrate, which was coated with the gold film
in advance. Then, the CdO vapor was transported by carrier gas and
reacted with Au, which acts as a catalyst to form alloy droplets.
As the droplets became supersaturated, crystalline CdO nanowires precipitated
with a liquid catalyst at the tip. Subsequently, the growth of nanowires
began. We observed that there were no discernable catalyst particles
on the tips of the CdO nanowires, which might be attributed to the
Au catalyst particles melting or falling off at high temperatures.38 Here, the Au particles play a very important
role in the growth of the CdO nanowires.39 The second stage of the growth was the formation of ZnO shells.40 With the mixture of ZnO and carbon spectrography
powders pushed into the center of the tube, the following reactions
could take place41          When the concentrations
of the Zn and O vapors increased rapidly and reached a supersaturation
state during the chemical reaction process, it was easy to form a
nucleation site on the CdO nanowires sidewall with a high crystal
lattice energy. As the vapor was transported downstream by carrier
gas, the CdO nanowires acted as a collector and the ZnO vapor deposited
on it, leading to the formation of the core/shell structure. The shell
of the ZnO nanowires has a typical hexagonal structure, which was
determined by its six equivalent crystal planes, i.e., ±(101̅0),
±(1̅100), and ±(011̅0).

Figure 5 Growth process of the
1D branched core/shell CdO/ZnO heterostructures.

The third stage is the homoepitaxial growth of the branches.
When the vapor concentration decreased to a certain extent, the dendritic
ZnO nanowires start to grow from the ZnO shell’s surface, where
the Cd liquid droplets, which came from the reduction of cadmium oxide
by carbon monoxide, act as catalysts, as manifested by the SEM results
in Figure 3. In addition,
the screw dislocation on the shell may act as a factor in the growth
of branches, which is a subject for further investigation.42,43 It should be emphasized that this is a preliminary proposal for
the mechanism of the structure formation and that many details remain
unresolved. We are going to work on collecting more data and refining
our proposal.

3.3 Diffuse Reflectance Properties
The optical reflectance properties of the CdO nanowires, the ZnO
nanowires, and the CdO/ZnO nanostructures were investigated by UV–vis
diffuse reflectance spectrum (DRS). As shown in Figure 6, the ZnO nanowires exhibit a characteristic
absorption peak near 380 nm, which agrees well with the band gap of
3.37 eV of ZnO. The CdO nanowires had a strong absorption below 550
nm, which should be ascribed to the excitonic absorption feature of
CdO.34 It is noted that the absorption
peaks at about 350 and 520 nm are not sharp, indicating that the absorption
bands might have originated from both direct and indirect transitions,
which is a characteristic of the CdO material.44 The UV–vis DRS of the CdO/ZnO nanostructures shows
a strong absorption in visible light and tailing into the near-infrared
range as compared with the ZnO nanowires. The broad band in the vicinity
of 500 nm may be attributed to CdO absorption. Thus, branched CdO/ZnO
core/shell heterostructures have quite strong and broad absorption
bands ranging from visible to ultraviolet light, suggesting that the
photocatalytic efficiency of the CdO/ZnO nanostructures under solar
irradiation could have a better performance.

reflectance spectra of CdO nanowires, ZnO nanowires, and CdO/ZnO nanostructures.

3.4 Photoelectrochemical
Characterization
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance
of the Si substrate, the ZnO nanowires, and the CdO/ZnO nanostructures
was evaluated by measuring the photocurrent response, as shown in Figure 7. Figure 7a is the current density–voltage
curves recorded in dark and under illumination by linear sweep voltammetry
(LSV) at the scan rate of 5 mV/s from −0.9 to −1.4 V
(vs Ag/AgCl). The light source was a 300 W xenon lamp with 350–780
nm wavelength, 150 mW/cm2 intensity, and 15 cm distance
between the light and the samples. The current density of the CdO/ZnO
hetero-nanostructures was up to 27 mA/cm2 in dark, which
is a significant enhancement compared to pure ZnO.

Figure 7 (a) LSV collected at
a scan rate of 5 mV/s in the dark and under illumination for the samples.
(b) Chronoamperometric (I–t) curves at an applied potential of −1.15 V vs Ag/AgCl under
illumination with 70 s light on–off cycles.

Upon light exposure, all the samples show an increase
in photocurrent to various extents. In particular, the photocurrent
of the CdO/ZnO hetero-nanostructures reached a maximum of 35 mA/cm2 under illumination, a substantial increase over pure zinc
oxide. This could be attributed to the hierarchical structure of the
heterogeneous nanowires that might have the high separation efficiency
of the electron–hole pairs, as well as the strong absorption
of light. The chronoamperometric (I–t) experiments were carried out at an applied potential
of −1.15 V vs Ag/AgCl under illumination with 70 s light on–off
cycles to further assess the stability of the photoelectrodes. As
shown in Figure 7b,
the photocurrent generation was triggered instantaneously upon illumination
and reached a steady state in each cycle (for more details, see Supporting
Information Figure S6).

To further
investigate the PEC activity of the semiconductor materials in which
the bulk conductivity as well as the interfacial charge transfer were
critical factors, EIS measurements were performed under illumination
in the frequency range of 10 000–0.01 Hz with an alternating
current amplitude of 5 mV.45 In the Nyquist
spectra (Figure 8),
the semicircle at high frequencies represent the charge transfer process,
and its radius represents the size of the electrical transmission
resistance. In general, the smaller radius indicates a faster electron
transport rate and a more efficient separation of the photogenerated
electrons and holes.24 As a comparison,
the EIS data for silicon substrate and ZnO nanowires were also charactered
(Figure 8). The CdO/ZnO
photoelectrode shows the smallest semicircle portion, indicating that
it has the smallest charge transfer resistance and the highest charge
separation efficiency. This could be attributed to the heterogeneous
structures between ZnO and CdO, which could improve the charge separation
efficiency.

and CdO/ZnO nanostructures.

4 Conclusions
We have successfully synthesized
a novel 1D branched core/shell CdO/ZnO heterostructure with high crystallinity
by an improved chemical vapor deposition method. This novel nanomaterial
has a Crimson bottlebrush-like structure in which the CdO nanowire
forms the core/trunk, whereas the hexagonal ZnO grows around the CdO
trunk to form the shell. On the shell, the ZnO nanowires were homogeneous
epitaxial grown perpendicular to the it via VLS mechanism while the
cadmium acts as catalyst. So that the 6-fold symmetrical branches
formed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of
cadmium as a catalyst. Such a nanostructure is quite uniform in a
large scale throughout the observed surface of the silicon substrate.
The structure has been thoroughly characterized and its formation
mechanism has been proposed. Because of the heterogeneous composite
nanostructure, it exhibits interesting optical and photoelectrochemical
properties. It has much stronger and broader light absorption, ranging
from UV to visible and near IR, than pure CdO or ZnO nanowires. The
photoelectrochemical activity and the electrochemical impedance spectral
measurements show that the charge collection efficiency of the 1D
hierarchical core/shell nanostructure has also been improved significantly
over that of ZnO nanowires. The heterogeneous branched core/shell
nanostructure might prevent or inhibit the recombination of the electron–hole
pairs to a certain extent and, hence, improve the effective charge
transfer so that it could be promising for applications as a more
effective photocatalyst. Further investigation to quantify these optical
and photoelectrochemical effects and elucidate the mechanism of the
heterostructure formation is in progress. Moreover, such novel nanostructured
materials would also find applications in a variety of fields, such
as field emission, photovoltaics, water decomposition, supercapacitors,
fuel cells, high-strength and multifunctional nanocomposites, etc.
