Maintaining low concentrations of
nitrogen compounds (ammonium,
nitrate and nitrite) in recirculating aquaculture waters is extremely
important for a larger and healthier fish production, as well as for
water discharge purposes. Although ammonium removal from aquaculture
streams is usually done within a nitrifying step, nitrate removal
via denitrification is still partially limited by the low organic
matter availability. Therefore, an easy-to-operate autotrophic denitrifying
bioelectrochemical system is herein proposed for the treatment of
seawater aquaculture streams. The nitrate-containing synthetic stream
flows sequentially through a biological denitrifying cathode (placed
at the lower portion of a tubular reactor) and an abiotic anode (generating
electrons and oxygen from water splitting, at the upper portion).
Experimental results with synthetic seawater showed that the system
reached denitrification rates of 0.13 ± 0.01 kg N m–3 day–1, operating with minimum ammonium and nitrite
accumulation, as well as minimum chlorine formation in the abiotic
anode, despite the high chloride concentration. There results support
the technical potential for simultaneous bioelectrochemical denitrification
and partial re-oxygenation of aquaculture waters either for recirculation
or discharge purposes.

Introduction
Nitrogen accumulation
represents an important factor contributing
to water deterioration in recirculating aquaculture systems (RASs).
Studies on nitrogen balances in aquaculture (which include a nitrifying
biofilter) indicate that cultivated species assimilate only 25–40%
of the nitrogen provided to the system as feed,1,2 whereas
30–40% is maintained as organic nitrogen in feces or unused
feed and will remain in the sediment at the bottom of the tanks.3 The remain fraction of nitrogen (approximately
30%) is usually excreted as ammonium, and it is further converted
to nitrate (NO3–),2,4 whereas
1.7 and 0.6% remain in the tanks as ammonium (NH4+) and nitrite (NO2–), respectively.2

Ammonium presents potential toxicity to
aquatic species, as it
is partially present in free ammonia form specially at high pH.5 Because of that, nitrifying treatment units are
usually installed in RAS, transforming the ammonium into less toxic
nitrate, which may accumulate in concentrations as high as 500 mg
L–1 NO3––N at
low water exchange rates.6 The accumulation
of nitrite, a toxic nitrification intermediate, may also occur.5 Although nitrate is generally better tolerated
by fish, its presence in concentrations higher than 125 mg L–1 NO3––N may be harmful to the
growth of some species such as turbot and prawns, especially during
the initial stages of development.7,8 In addition,
the Australian and New Zealand Guidelines for Fresh and Marine Water
Quality9 suggest that nitrate concentrations
in aquaculture systems should be lower than 50 mg L–1 for freshwater species and 100 mg L–1 for saltwater
species. In summary, maintaining concentrations of nitrogen compounds
below those values is extremely important for a larger and healthier
fish production in RAS with a high recirculation rates. Furthermore,
due to increasingly stricter environmental regulations worldwide,
nitrate removal is also required before the discharge into natural
ecosystems. As an example, the levels of NOx (NO3–N + NO2–N) ranging from
1 to 30 μg L–1 are already considered sufficient
to trigger slightly to moderate disturbance in the aquatic systems
in some tropical areas of Australia.9 Those
values are highly dependent on the level of environmental protection
of the aquatic ecosystem and average rainfall, which may considerably
influence licensed discharge limits, depending on the location of
the aquaculture farm.

More recently, the installation of denitrification
units has been
proposed in RAS to reduce levels of nitrate in fish tanks10 and enable higher rates of water recirculation/reuse.
Available technologies usually rely on heterotrophic microbial metabolism
where addition of carbon sources (e.g., methanol) is done to guarantee
sufficient C/N ratio to achieve complete denitrification. However,
the return of unused organic matter carried over from the denitrification
unit to the aquaculture tanks may cause fish toxicity or the undesired
growth of bacteria and further consumption of oxygen. In addition,
it may lead to hypoxic conditions in the fish tank, potentially leading
to death of farmed species if no further aeration/oxygenation is provided.
Although methanol addition can be avoided by using endogenous carbon
sources11 (which may require a pre-digestion
of organic material eventually coming from the fish farm itself),
the above issues may still occur. Alternatively, autotrophic bioreactors
rely on chemolithotrophic microbial metabolism, using carbon dioxide
as the carbon source and hydrogen gas as the energy source. Hydrogen
can be introduced from a compressed gas cylinder or, alternatively,
generated in situ at the cathode of a (bio)electrolytic cell.12,13 Because the latter process may use microorganisms to catalyze nitrate
reduction at the biofilm–electrode interface, the process can
be referred to as bioelectrochemical denitrification.14

In a typical bioelectrochemical system (BES) performing
denitrification,
electrons can be generated abiotically by electrolysis of water at
the anode with simultaneous production of oxygen gas.15 The electrons generated from the oxygen evolution are then
transferred to the cathode through an external circuitry where they
are used for microbial-mediated denitrification either via direct
electron transfer or via intermediate H2 production. Because
the presence of dissolved oxygen (DO) is critical for fish respiration,
the anodically generated oxygen is desirable and beneficial in maintaining
adequate oxygen levels in the aquaculture tanks.

Although various
examples of applications of BES technology to
treat nitrate-contaminated water streams are presented in the scientific
literature (e.g., in the fields of wastewater and groundwater treatment),16−19 to our best knowledge, there are currently no studies available
demonstrating the bioelectrochemical denitrification in seawater streams
commonly used in aquaculture. Therefore, this work focuses on developing
an easy-to-operate system able to achieve autotrophic bioelectrochemical
denitrification, potentially providing a useful oxygenation step of
the treated effluent. By systematically studying the variations in
flow rate, buffer concentration and mixing condition, we aim to identify
the system’s rate-limiting steps (i.e., nitrate availability,
buffer availability, ion transfer between cathode and anode or mass
transfer at biofilm/electrolyte interface) and maximize the reactor’s
performance.

Results and Discussion
Tests at Different Influent
Flow Rates
Liquid samples
during test 1 were taken twice at each flow rate, and in each direction
of the test (increasing/decreasing flow rate), totaling four replicates.
Therefore, averages and standard deviations presented herein were
obtained for the four replicate samples, unless stated otherwise (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Reactor behavior during
test 1, carried out with the flow rates
of 3, 2, 1, and 0.5 L day–1 corresponding to 40,
60, 120, and 240 min HRT, respectively. (a) Experimental and calculated
current production based on maximum buffer capacity (mA), nitrate
removal rate via complete denitrification (kg NO3––N m–3 day–1), and nitrogen
removal efficiency (%). (b) Nitrogen balance (%) of all nitrate entering
the system. NO3––N, N2O–N, NO2––N, and NH4+–N were measured from liquid samples, whereas
N2 was assumed to be a result of complete denitrification
and calculated as all unaccounted nitrogen in liquid samples. (c)
The reactor pH profile at different sampling points: influent media,
postcathode media, and postanode media leaving the system. (d) Cell
voltage (V) and calculated energy consumption (kWh kg NO3––N–1). (e) Anodic reactions:
anodic potential (V), dissolved oxygen (mg L–1 O2), and free chlorine (mg L–1 Cl2).

The electric current reaches a
maximum of 7.2 mA at the beginning
of the first run at the flow rate of 3 L day–1,
then decreases to a minimum of 3.9 mA at the flow rate of 0.5 L day–1 (Figure 1a). A further decrease in current is observed when the flow
rate is 1 L day–1, likely due to air intrusion when
previously replacing the feed reservoir, which possibly leads to a
temporary and unusual mixing/hydraulic condition (i.e., hydraulic
retention time (HRT)) before this specific sample—also possibly
leading to a mismatched nitrate concentration. Similarly, slight variations
in the current profiles were produced each time a liquid sample was
taken just above the cathode area.

Nitrogen removal rate is
at its maximum at 2 and 3 L day–1 (0.13 ± 0.01
kg N m–3 day–1, with no significant
difference between these two flow rates; P = 0.70)
and decreases to 0.07 ± 0.01 kg N m–3 day–1 at 0.5 L day–1 (Figure 1a). These nitrogen-removal
rates are within the ranges previously reported for bioelectrochemical
denitrification (0.05–0.41 kg N m–3 day–1),14,18,20 which proves the proposed setup as a viable system for nitrate removal
from saltwater streams.

Although better nitrogen removal rates
is observed at 3 L day–1 (0.7 kg N m–3 day–1 loading rate), only less than 20% of NO3––N is completely removed as N2 (Figure 1b),
indicating that lower nitrate
loading rates of 0.11 and 0.23 kg N m–3 day–1 are best suited for this purpose. In fact, best nitrate
removal efficiencies and minimum nitrite accumulation are achieved
at these lower loading rates. The accumulation of nitrate and nitrite
at the fast flow rate indicates that the nitrate-loading rate is not
the rate-limiting step of the process.

Although sulfate was
also present in the artificial saltwater media,
its theoretical redox potential (E0′ = −0.213 V vs standard hydrogen electrode (SHE))21 is much lower than that of nitrate (E0′ = +0.43 V vs SHE),22 which indicates that nitrate is a much preferable electron
acceptor than sulfate. Thus, considering that nitrate was still present
in the reactor at all times, sulfur reduction was neglected. Minteq
simulations indicated that approximately 10–18% of the added
sodium bicarbonate is expected in acid form (CO2), and
these values were strongly affected even by small variations within
the influent pH. After passing through the cathodic zone, the pH increases
immediately from the neutral values of the feed (Figure 1c), and this variation is inversely
associated to the flow rate, reaching 8.0 ± 0.1 at the lowest
flow rate of 0.5 L day–1. After the anodic zone,
the pH tends again toward neutral values (7.2 ± 0.3) due to anodic
oxygen evolution reaction, which consumes alkalinity. However, only
a maximum of 1% of the bicarbonate system is predicted to be present
as CO32– at the measured effluent pH,
indicating that only a negligible buffer capacity is provided by protons
coming from HCO3– to form CO32–. Interestingly, the estimated current generation
is lower than that obtained experimentally, but follows a similar
trend at all times (Figure 1a), indicating that the effective buffer capacity is strongly
linked to the system’s performance. These results also suggest
a depletion of buffer capacity (proton availability from bicarbonate
system), in which consumption of protons coming from water splitting
rather than from CO2 (which led to pH rise) could allow
a higher current generation than originally predicted. Alternatively,
it is also possible that other (unaccounted) buffer species are also
present or that slightly inaccurate pK values of
the bicarbonate buffer were predicted by the model.

The measured
anodic potential shows a positive correlation with
Cl2 concentration (Figure 1e). However, the measured potentials are relatively
constant at all times (+1.18 ± 0.02 V vs SHE) and lower than
the standard redox potential for Cl2 formation (E0′ =
+1.36 V vs SHE),23 which explains the very
low concentration of Cl2 detected in the effluent (0.07
± 0.06 mg L–1 Cl2, which is very
close to the lower detection limit of the method, despite the very
high concentration of sea salt of prepared artificial media). Although
chloramine formation is also possible in the system, only negligible
amounts can be expected due to the low concentration of free ammonia
(less than 2% of total ammonium at pH 7.5, corresponding to 0.003
mM NH3 in our system). In addition, as shown in Figure 1e, only less than
0.2 mg L–1 Cl2 (0.0056 mM Cl) was detected
in the reactor effluent at all times. Thus, considering the required
ratio of 1:1 (N/Cl), chloramine formation would be limited by the
amount of free ammonia in our system. Moreover, chloramine is a milder
disinfectant than free chlorine itself.

Although the measured
DO is also very low (1.3 ± 0.7 mg L–1 O2), the measured anode potentials are
higher than the standard potential for O2 formation (E0′ =
+0.82 V vs SHE).22 It is possible that
bubbles formation may reduce the transfer rates of O2 between
the electrode (at formation points) and the liquid phase, which corroborates
with a slightly larger dissolved oxygen concentration at smaller flow
rates: longer HRTs would enable higher transfer of oxygen from bubbles
(formed at anode) toward the liquid phase. Therefore, further improvement
in electrode configuration and mixing regimes enabling better transfer
of oxygen to liquid phase are encouraged.

Effect of Electrolyte Buffer
Capacity
Although pH and
buffer capacity of synthetic media normally tested in BES systems
are well known to influence reactors performance,24−27 the variability of media composition
on the effective buffer capacity has not been evaluated so far. When
applying only 1 g L–1 NaHCO3, the pH
increases from 6.91 ± 0.01 (inflow media) to 8.01 ± 0.01
(outflow right after the cathode). However, the pH increases from
only 7.3 ± 0.1 to 7.5 ± 0.1 when 6 g L–1 NaHCO3 was tested (Figure 2a). Based on the pH measurements shown in Figure 2a and known concentration
of major ions in prepared media, the proton availability (i.e., mM
H+) and expected current production are calculated as shown
in Figure 2b. Although
the buffer capacity increases with the addition of bicarbonate, the
Minteq simulations indicate that bicarbonate speciation and effective
concentration of proton equivalents in the saltwater medium are strongly
dependent on the pH. As indicated, the added bicarbonate increases
by a factor of 6, whereas the effective buffer capacity only doubles
due to the slightly higher feed pH when 6 g L–1 sodium
bicarbonate was added.

Figure 2 Effects of different buffer capacity concentrations. Tests
were
carried out with added concentrations of 1, 2, 4, and 6 g L–1 NaHCO3 (leading to total influent concentrations of
14.3, 26.2, 50.0, and 73.8 mM, respectively). (a) pH profiles of the
influent and cathodic effluent medium. (b) Experimental and calculated
current production based on buffer capacity (mA) and maximum proton
availability from bicarbonate buffer system at the influent/effluent
pH. (c) Effective and expected denitrification rates and nitrate loading
rate (kg NO3––N m–3 day–1). (d) Concentration of nitrate reduction
products leaving the cathodic zone. The sum of all the products represents
the total nitrate reduced in the system.

The effective current generation is in fact slightly higher
than
predicted, which reflects bigger pH changes between inflow and outflow
upon small additions of sodium bicarbonate, corroborating the tests
at different flow rates. However, predicted and effective current
values tend to match more closely at higher bicarbonate additions,
and a minimum pH change is observed when adding 6 g L–1 sodium bicarbonate.

The increase in sodium bicarbonate concentration
(from 1 to 6 g
L–1 NaHCO3) also leads to an increase
in the denitrification rates from 0.14 ± 0.01 to 0.18 ±
0.02 kg N m–3 day–1, respectively
(Figure 2c). However,
the effective denitrification rates are smaller than expected at the
maximum added buffer capacity, as a result of a bigger nitrite accumulation
(Figure 2d). In addition,
a slightly smaller Coulombic efficiency (CE) occurred when adding
6 g L–1 sodium bicarbonate (90.8 ± 1.5%, compared
to 105.1 ± 0.2 at 1 g L–1 sodium bicarbonate
addition), indicating that more electrons are lost and not used for
denitrification at high additions of bicarbonate. Noteworthy, the
high Coulombic efficiency observed at all times indicates that the
amount of electrons used for nitrate reduction closely match the amount
of electrons provided electrochemically. Thus, these high CE values
strongly suggest that no organic matter was present in the system
and the cathode was the sole electron donor for denitrification.

Although previous studies clearly indicated the dependency between
buffer capacity and current generation in bioelectrochemical systems,
to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating
a relationship between effective buffer capacity (as H+ equivalents) and expected (calculated) current. However, because
the method is based simply on medium characteristics, it assumes that
microbial activity is not a limiting factor. Thus, achieving maximum
removal rates will in practice depend on the preliminary biofilm growth/adaptation
and other environmental conditions. Moreover, as clearly indicated
in the experiments with variable flow rates, the effective current
generated can be slightly higher than predicted, resulting in a pH
rise (Figure 1a).

Testing the Effect of Mixing Conditions
As indicated
in Figure 3b, the cathode
region poses the highest pseudo-Ohmic resistance of the system (5.9
± 0.4 Ω), despite its depth being only 5 cm as opposed
to 7 cm for both gap (3.8 ± 0.2 Ω) and anode bed (1.8 ±
1.5 Ω). Although cathodic and gap resistance are relatively
constant throughout the experimental conditions, the anodic resistance
is greatly reduced when the anodic recirculation starts (phase 2).
Despite anodic recirculation being also included in phase 3, the anodic
resistance increased slightly. However, in phases 4 and 5, the anodic
resistance was greatly increased in the absence of anodic recirculation
and feed, respectively.

Figure 3 Electrochemical behavior of the reactor at different
mixing conditions
during test 3. (a) Current generation (mA, n = 3)
and (b) electrolyte’s pseudo-Ohmic resistance (Ohm) of different
regions of the reactor: anodic, cathodic, and gap (cathode ×
anode) sections.

The flux of ions between
the electrodes in electrochemical systems
is driven by (1) diffusion (due to activity gradient), (2) migration
(due to an electrostatic potential gradient dependent on electrolyte
resistivity) and (3) convection (due to fluid flow/agitation).28 However, considering that ions’ concentrations
in the bulk solution are high enough, then the flux of ions through
the diffusion in BES can be considered negligible. Moreover, the relatively
constant cathodic and gap resistance with different mixing conditions
in our study indicates the true Ohmic nature of the charge transfer,
whereby the ions’ flux is driven mainly by migration processes
(Figure 3). Noteworthy,
the migration of ions is directly correlated to ionic conductivity
(and inversely correlated to Ohmic resistance). Thus, considering
that a seawater medium containing 35 g L–1 sea salts
presents conductivity sufficiently high to enable efficient migration
ion transport, it is understandable that no further reduction in electrolyte
resistance will occur by applying the recirculation circuits. Therefore,
although the recirculation circuit 2 around the cathodic region clearly
improves current generation (Figure 3a), the constant Ohmic resistance indicates that convection
did not play a role in ion transport within the cathodic region and
increased performance is attributed to improved mass transfer or flow
distribution within the cathode rather than convective charge flow.

Similarly, the pseudo-Ohmic resistance is not affected by mixing
within the gap section when activating recirculation circuit 1, which
would represent an important factor for reactor up scaling. In fact,
small Ohmic losses across the liquid phase due to high salinity would
enable a reduction in cell voltage or use of bigger electrodes surface
area with minimal losses.

Contrary to a purely migration-driven
process, a decrease in pseudo-Ohmic
resistance at the anodic region is observed when recirculation circuit
1 is introduced, indicating the presence of a non-Ohmic behavior.
The improvement in current generation with recirculation circuit 1
is attributed to the removal of gas bubbles formed at the anode (i.e.,
oxygen gas), which prevent contact between the electrode surface and
the liquid phase, thus inactivating part of the anode. Those results
confirm the importance of convection processes through anodic recirculation
to the system, which facilitates mass transport and gas dispersion
within the anode. This behavior did not occur at the cathode likely
due to the cathode setup in which the granules were occupying the
whole reactor’s cross section, forcing the water to flow through
(i.e., avoiding preferential flow) and likely removing the N2 bubbles.

Considerations toward Application of the
Technology
Considering the saltwater medium containing 1
g L–1 NaHCO3 (11.9 mM), approximately
7.3% of this bicarbonate
is present (at pH 7) as CO2/carbonic acid, working as buffer.
This corresponds to a concentration of approximately 38 mg L–1 CO2, which is 2.6 times higher than the 15 mg L–1 CO2 (0.34 mM) suggested for aquaculture waters.9 However, this added 11.9 mM bicarbonate is not
enough to maintain the pH balance within the cathodic denitrifying
biofilm. Thus, the pH-dependent buffer capacity of aquaculture waters
might limit cathodic denitrification and further addition of bicarbonate
may not be recommended, as it will likely increase the CO2 levels to concentrations higher than acceptable for fish production.
Although previous studies reported that denitrification reactions
in bioelectrochemical systems require a pH between 6.0 and 6.5,25 which can increase proton availability via the
CO2/bicarbonate system, reducing the pH to such low levels
could become impractical for the treatment of saltwater aquaculture
streams, which commonly have pH higher than 8.0.29,30 However, most recirculating aquaculture systems do have an operating
nitrifying treatment step,31,32 which intrinsically
reduces the pH and alkalinity of the water during ammonium oxidation
to nitrate.33,34 Noteworthy, the stoichiometry
of autotrophic nitrification indicates that two protons are produced
for each NH4+ oxidized to NO3–. Thus, those protons can theoretically provide one
third of the protons required for the reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen
gas (six protons/NO3–). Moreover, alkalinity
and buffer capacity of the recirculating water can be restored if
a denitrification step is installed after the nitrification filter,
which potentially enables a reduction of bicarbonate addition commonly
done in aquaculture for alkalinity restoration.34 Moreover, it is hypothesized that a slightly higher overall
recirculation level of the aquaculture stream through the denitrifying
reactor would enable low nitrate levels that are well matched with
the buffer capacity of the recirculating water.

The overall
energy consumption (test 1) for nitrogen removal via denitrification
(27 ± 6 kWh kg N–1) varies according to cell
voltage, especially when fast flow rates are applied (Figure 1d). Although lowest cell voltages
are obtained at 0.5 L day–1, a lower nitrogen removal
per operation time is observed, which raises the specific energy consumption
at this flow rate. Although this energy consumption represents operational
costs that are currently twice as high as those for the operation
of sand filters (Supporting Information 3), the standard costs for aeration of aquaculture fish tanks could
be at least partially offset by taking into account the production
of oxygen at the anode. Based purely on the calculations that take
into account the generated current, if produced, oxygen concentrations
at the effluent of the BES could achieve levels—at the exit
of the bioelectrochemical denitrification reactor—ranging from
16.4 mg O2 L–1 at 3 L day–1 to concentrations above the oxygen saturation at 1 atm. Since producing
dissolved oxygen above the saturation concentration is not feasible
in practice, one could suggest a recirculation around the anode to
include a circuit straight from the fish tank, thus diluting the generated
oxygen in the water column of the fish tanks. However, further studies
are still necessary to improve oxygen diffusion from the anode, especially
at such high (calculated) oxygen production rates.

Due to the
novelty in performing autotrophic cathodic denitrification
of saltwater streams in BES, microbial community structure assessment
via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing is presented in the Supporting Information 4, describing the community
composition and indicating the main drivers of the denitrification
process in our study. At this stage, this study comprises a proof
of concept, indicating the applicability of the bioelectrochemical
denitrification as a valid alternative to heterotrophic denitrification
and simultaneous reoxygenation in saltwater aquaculture streams. The
system showed minimum ammonium and nitrite accumulation, simultaneously
achieving negligible production of Cl2 despite the high
salt concentration of the synthetic media. However, further improvements
are suggested to enhance the reactor’s performance and decrease
the capital and operational costs before full-scale implementation,
which includes increasing nitrate removal rates and minimizing the
size of the other electrochemical components, especially the size
of the anode.

Material and Methods
Reactor Setup
A single-chamber cylindrical reactor
with 1 L total volume capacity (6 cm internal diameter) was used for
the experiments (Figure 4). Graphite granules (EC-100, Minus 3/8 inch by 10 U.S. Standard
Mesh-10 mm × 2 mm, Graphite Sales, Inc.) were used as both anode
and cathode materials. External connection was guaranteed by inserting
a graphite rod (National CMG rods 74-5671-00 3/16 × 12) in both
electrodes. The cathode bed (5 cm depth) had a volume of approximately
160 mL (80 mL net cathodic volume (NCV), corresponding to the liquid
volume held within the cathodic graphite granular bed). Cathodic granules
were placed on top of a perforated acrylic plate as a supporting material,
with a gap of 6 cm from the bottom of the reactor to allow for uniform
water distribution through the cathode bed. Anodic granules (abiotically
operated) were contained in a basket made of inert plastic mesh (7
cm deep × 3 cm diameter, totaling 44 mL net anode volume) and
inserted through the top of the reactor, with an anode–cathode
gap, that is, the distance between the top of the cathode and the
bottom of the anode, of 7 cm. No membrane was used between anode and
cathode. Media recirculation was initially done within the cathode
to avoid flow channeling and mass transfer limitations (electrolyte
recirculated from the top portion of the cathode, back to its lower
portion at a flow rate of approximately 9 L h–1),
except when stated otherwise. A reference electrode called RE0 (Ag/AgCl, saturated KCl, corresponding to −0.197 V
vs standard hydrogen electrode, SHE) was inserted above the cathode,
enabling a three-electrode setup. To enable biologically mediated
hydrogen production,35 while maximizing
hydrogen uptake for denitrification (as noticed in preliminary studies
done in our laboratory), the cathode potential was controlled at −0.7
V vs SHE with the use of a potentiostat (VMP3, Bio-Logic, France).
Unless otherwise stated, the electrochemical potentials are herein
reported versus the SHE.

Reactor Operation and Monitoring
The reactor was enriched
in continuous mode using freshwater synthetic media during preliminary
operation (Supporting Information 1) and
was shifted to saltwater operation by gradually increasing the salt
concentration to 35 g L–1 sea salt (Ocean Nature
Sea Salt, Aquasonic, Australia). During the adaptation, the reactor
was then reinoculated with sediments taken from an intertidal mangrove
environment (5–40 cm deep) in Southeast Queensland, Australia.
Subsamples were taken throughout the whole depth of the collected
core sample, mixed together, and suspended in artificial brackish
water containing 25 g L–1 sea salt, 20 mg L–1 NO3––N, 1 g L–1 NaHCO3, 19.4 mg L–1 NaH2PO4, 3.84 mg L–1 NH4Cl, and trace elements solution as previously described.36 Although nitrate concentration in recirculating
aquaculture systems can reach high levels (>100 mg L–1), as previously mentioned, reduced levels are generally required
for discharge purposes, especially in sensitive areas. In addition,
considering that (1) low levels of nitrogen also contribute to a reduced
growth of other (undesired) organisms within the water columns and
(2) intrinsic buffer capacity provided by the naturally occurring
bicarbonate system in the fish tanks may only allow for the reduction
of low nitrate amounts, the authors propose herein that nitrogen levels
should be always kept at low levels, thus justifying the addition
of only 20 mg L–1 NO3––N in the feed. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 6.9 by
adding HCl 1 M. The suspended material was then allowed to settle
overnight at 3 °C. After this step (considering that microbial
cells would deposit on the upper layer of the settled material), only
the supernatant and the upper layer were collected, whereas the heavier
solids (possibly containing large amounts of biodegradable particles)
were discarded. The collected supernatant was centrifuged at 12 000
rpm for 10 min. In this stage, the supernatant fraction of the centrifuged
material was then discarded (removing the dissolved organic matter),
whereas the fine sediment fraction was resuspended in 10 mL synthetic
brackish water and inserted in the reactor through a port within the
mid portion of the cathodic bed.

The synthetic seawater aquaculture
medium used for the experiments was the same brackish water medium
described above, except for a higher sea salt concentration (35 g
L–1). The medium was fed continuously from the bottom
of the reactor, flowing first through cathodic zone and then toward
anodic zone at 3 L day–1, unless stated otherwise.
Noteworthy, the use of the synthetic solutions in this study enabled
the assessment of fundamental research questions and the proof of
concept, which required strictly controlled experimental conditions
(i.e., known concentration of major ions and stable influent characteristics).

The reactor’s performance was evaluated through electrochemical
measurements and by analyzing the liquid samples taken above the cathodic
zone—which warrants the characterization of the denitrification
products right after the media has passed through the cathodic zone.
The liquid samples were filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane
filter (Merck). Dissolved nitrogen species (NO3––N, NO2––N, and NH4+–N) were analyzed via Flow Injection Analyser
(Lachat QuikChem8000, Lachat Instruments, Milwaukee) and greenhouse
gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4)
were analyzed as previously described for liquid samples.37 Nitric oxide (NO), formed as an intermediate
step during denitrification, is usually consumed at fast rates; its
accumulation was assumed negligible in our system, hence it was not
measured.16,38,39 Dissolved
oxygen (DO) and Cl2 were measured after anodic zone using
a DO probe (SevenGo pro, Mettler Toledo International) and Free Chlorine
colorimetric method (USEPA DPD method 8021, HACH), respectively.

The cell voltage and energy consumption were recorded at all times
by the potentiostat. Four additional (independent) reference electrodes
not connected a potentiostat (RE1–4) were also inserted
at different levels in the water column. By connecting these electrodes
to a multimeter (Fluke 179 True RMS), it was possible to determine
the effective anode potentials (Ean, which
was a function of cell voltage, depending on cathodic requirements),
as well as the liquid potential losses.

Experiments
The
following experimental sequence was
developed to evaluate individually the effects of influent flow rate,
added bicarbonate concentration, and mixing conditions. The tests
were done after 135 days of reactor operation.

Test 1: Flow Rate and Hydraulic
Retention Time (HRT) Variation
To determine the effects of
different nitrate and buffer loading
rates on current production and N-products profile, a series of feed
flow rates and hence hydraulic retention times were tested. Starting
from the fastest feed rate (which indirectly enabled higher buffer
loads to pass through the cathode), the flow rate was decreased on
a daily basis (3, 2, 1, and 0.5 L day–1, corresponding
to cathodic HRT of approximately 40, 60, 120, and 240 min respectively),
followed again by stepwise daily increase in the flow rate to test
the reproducibility of the results. During test 1, recirculation was
applied within the cathode (recirculation circuit 2) only to avoid
mass transfer limitations. Liquid samples were taken twice at each
condition (approximately 16 and 24 h after setting up a new flow rate).

Test 2: Bicarbonate Concentration
Based on previous
work on microbial anodes and cathodes,40,41 it is hypothesized
that the electron transfer rate at the cathode is controlled not by
the nitrate loading but by the supply rate of pH buffers. The following
set of tests was done to understand the effects of different buffer
concentrations and assess whether higher buffer concentrations could
improve current generation and denitrification rates. The role of
buffer capacity provided by bicarbonate system was evaluated by adding
1, 2, 4, and 6 g L–1 sodium bicarbonate, leading
to the final concentrations of 14.3, 26.2, 50.0, and 73.8 mM respectively
(which includes 2.3 mM bicarbonate present in the commercial sea salt
added). Thus, the procedure theoretically increased the buffer capacity
at a fixed flow rate of 3 L day–1 and influent pH
7.1 ± 0.2. Recirculation within the cathode was kept at all times
to avoid mass transfer limitations. Considering a 20% nitrate removal
efficiency obtained in preliminary tests at a low buffer capacity,
and assuming that the removal rate may increase linearly with the
added sodium bicarbonate, one could assume that nitrate would be completely
removed if more than 5 g L–1 sodium bicarbonate
is added. Therefore, to enable the tests at high bicarbonate concentrations
to be carried out also in the presence of nitrate (thus enabling the
determination of the removal rates), the feed nitrate concentration
(20 mg L–1 NO3––N
when testing 1 and 2 g L–1 sodium bicarbonate) was
increased to 40 mg L–1 NO3––N when testing 4 and 6 g L–1 sodium bicarbonate.

The added sodium bicarbonate is expected to dissociate in solution
as follows    In ideal (standard) conditions,
pKa1 and pKa2 values of bicarbonate
system (i.e., 6.4 and 10.2, respectively) dictate the relative amount
of each dissociated form, depending on the actual pH of the solution.
If the solution has a neutral pH close to pKa1, it is expected that approximately 50% of the added sodium
bicarbonate will dissociate into carbonic acid (CO2/H2CO3) and 50% into bicarbonate (HCO3–), whereas negligible CO32– will be present. The effective buffer capacity is therefore considered
to be the concentration of protons (mM H+) that can potentially
be yielded during the conversion of H2CO3 to
HCO3–. At higher pH values that are closer
to pKa2 (as it may occur at the exit of
cathode zone due to denitrification activity), part of HCO3– can also loose protons and be further converted
to CO32–, providing additional buffer
capacity at a higher pH.

However, in real conditions, the effective
buffer capacity of bicarbonate
system may be affected by the presence of other ions. As previously
reviewed by Batstone et al.,42 nonideal
behavior of physicochemical processes such as ion pairing and speciation
can significantly influence wastewater treatment (i.e., interfering
on precipitation)43 and should be considered.
Therefore, because the media used in this set of experiments contained
high ionic strength characteristic of seawater (>0.6 M), bicarbonate
speciation and medium effective buffer capacity was assessed by using
the Minteq software (Visual MINTEQ 3.1, J.P. Gustafsson, Sweden),
using the Debye–Hückel method for activity correction.
As input parameters, the total concentration of most important ions
in the medium (>0.05 mM) was considered, calculated as the sum
of
ions provided by both seasalt and added ions (according to the described
media composition) at the measured inflow and outflow pH. At 1 g L–1 added NaHCO3, the ion concentrations were
as follows: 544.2 mM Cl–, 28.2 mM SO42–, 480.2 mM Na+, 52.8 mM Mg2+, 14.3 mM CO32–, 10.2 mM Ca2+, 10.2 mM K+, 1.41 mM NO3–, 0.3 mM Br–, 0.16 mM PO43–, 0.09 mM Sr2+, and 0.07 mM NH4+.

Test 3: Mixing Conditions
To investigate whether convection
plays a role on ion transfer between cathode and anode, we checked
whether current generation and potential losses across liquid phase
(within cathodic, anodic, and gap sections) are affected by mixing
conditions. A series of recirculating/feeding conditions were tested
as a different combination of presence/absence of feed (3 L day–1) and recirculation circuits C1 (9 L h–1)—within both anode and gap sections—and C2 (9 L h–1)—within cathodic section only (Figure 4). The different tests included:
phase 1: feed + C2; phase 2, full recirculation: feed + C1 + C2; phase
3: feed + C1; phase 4: feed only; and phase 5: no feed/recirculation.
Each condition was kept for at least 3 h, allowing cathodic media
to be completely replaced (>3 cathodic HRTs) before measuring the
Ohmic potential losses across liquid phase—except for phase
5, which was carried out in the absence of feed. Voltage losses across
the liquid phase were measured through four additional (independent)
reference electrodes, placed (RE1) on top of anode, (RE2), below anode, (RE3), just above cathode bed,
and (RE4) below cathode bed. Those independent electrodes
allowed for the measurement of potential losses across different portions
of the reactor: cathode, anode, and gap (Figure 4).

Calculations
Cathodic
Coulombic efficiency was calculated
as  where M = 14 mg per mmol–1is the nitrogen molecular weight; V (L) is the liquid volume of the cathodic region; ΔNO3––N, ΔNO2––N, ΔN2O–N, and ΔNH4+–N (mg N L–1) are the differences
of nitrogen concentrations between outflow and inflow; C (Coulombs) is the cumulative electric charge transferred through
the duration of the experiment (set to 1 HRT); and F is the Faraday constant (96 485 C per mol e–). As previously demonstrated, nitric oxide accumulation is assumed
to be negligible.16,38,39 Moreover, as demonstrated in the above equation, electron losses
due to uptake via dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium were
considered.

The energy consumption was calculated as described
elsewhere.44 Potential losses across liquid
phase in anodic, gap, and cathodic regions were calculated as ΔEan = RE1 – RE2,
ΔEgap = RE2 –
RE3, ΔEcat = RE3 – RE4, where ΔE is the
electrolyte’s Ohmic drop measured between two reference electrodes
(RE). Pseudo-Ohmic resistance (PRΩ) across different
regions of the reactor were then calculated according to Ohms’s
law (PRΩ = ΔE × I–1), where PR (Ω) is the electrolyte’s
resistance of each region and I is the current (A)
flowing through the device. The use of the term pseudo-Ohmic resistance
herein acknowledges that the overall resistance across the electrolyte
might be lower than the Ohmic resistance itself if convection significantly
contributes to ion transfer.

Moreover, considering 1 proton
available per CO2 in
the influent medium and 1 proton yielded per CO32– formed in effluent medium, the maximum theoretical current based
on buffer capacity can be calculated as  where Q is the influent flow
rate (L day–1), CO2 in (mM) is the
concentration of CO2/H2CO3 acid form
in the prepared media (given by Minteq simulation, considering influent
pH), CO32–out (mM) is the
concentration of CO32– basic form present
at the exit from cathode (given by Minteq simulation, considering
effluent pH), n is the amount of electrons required
for the reduction of each proton (1 electron/proton), and 86 400
is the time conversion factor.

Values of nitrate removal rates
via complete denitrification provided
herein are normalized to NCV, unless stated otherwise.
