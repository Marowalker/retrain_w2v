A series of dihydropyrrol-2-ones
(DHPs) were designed and synthesized
via an efficient multicomponent reaction at room temperature for evaluation
of their bioactivities against four human cancer lines (MCF-7, RKO,
HeLa, and A549) in vitro. Preliminary structure–activity relationship
studies showed that R4 = 3-MeO-4-OH-Ph is a crucial group
for increasing cytotoxicities against RKO cells and the influences
of R1–R3 depend on their combination.
It was found that DHPs 5a, 5q, and 5s showed the best antiproliferative activities against A549,
RKO, and all four studied cell lines, respectively (IC50 = 1.9, 0.8, and 0.9–2.4 μM). They can be used as new
lead compounds for developing potentially selective or broad spectrum
anticancer agents. 5q proves as a potent G0/G1-phase
arresting agent inducing cell apoptosis by increasing/decreasing the
levels of p53 and p21/cyclin D1.

Introduction
Cancer, the second
leading cause of global death, was responsible
for 8.8 million deaths in 2015, amounting to nearly 1 in 6 of all
deaths in the world.1 Therefore, many different
fields have devoted much effort to exploring anticancer therapeutics.
In cell cycles, there are two important transitions, the transitions
of the G1 to S phase and G2 to M phase. These transitions are very
important for regulating cellular multiplication processes and cell
apoptosis, and are easily affected by environmental conditions. The
tumorigenesis of many cancers is closely related to the improper signaling
of cell cycle regulators. G0/G1-phase arresting agents can arrest
the cellular proliferating cycle progressing from the G0/G1 to S phase.
Palbociclib (I, Figure 1),2 first approved as a
CDK4/6 inhibitor for breast cancer in 2015, arrests tumorigenesis
by interfering with S and M phases of the cell cycle and withdraws
the cell cycle back into the G0/G1-phase. Two other CDK4/6 inhibitors,
abemaciclib (Lilly) (II)3 and
ribociclib (III),4 are approved
for the treatment of multiple types of cancers. Compound IV exhibits potent activity against breast cancer cells, arresting
cells in the G0/G1-phase and decreasing the cellular levels of cyclin
D1.5 G0/G1-phase arresting agents V(6) and VI(7) show good anticancer activity against SH-SY5Y
cells and HCT-116 colon cancer cells, respectively.

Multicomponent reaction (MCR)
has advantages of atom economy, high
efficiency, and fast building structural diversity and complexity
of compound libraries8−10 and becomes a powerful tool in drug synthesis and
discovery.9,11,12 Considering
that heterocycles have diverse bioactivities, we are interested in
their MCR synthesis13−17 and bioactivities.18 Pyrrolidone rings
are important heterocycles with a wide range of pharmacological activities,
such as G0/G1-phase arresting agents VI. In this work,
we report novel G0/G1-phase arresting agents pentasubstituted dihydropyrrol-2-ones
(DHPs) (Table 1), the
products of a convenient MCR that we developed.13

Results and Discussion
In the experimental
screening of the bioactivities against MCF-7
(human breast cancer), RKO (human colon cancer), HeLa (human cervical
cancer), and A549 (human lung cancer) cell lines of small organic
compounds, it was found that DHP 5a has good activity
against the four cell lines, especially A549. Then, 19 DHPs (5b–5t) were designed and synthesized to
further study their bioactivities using 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) as a
positive control. Their antiproliferative activities were expressed
as IC50 values and are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, most of the DHPs exhibited moderate to
satisfactory antiproliferative activities against the four human cancer
cell lines. Among these DHPs, 5a displayed higher cytotoxicities
against A549 cells (IC50 = 1.9 μM) than the other
three human cancer cells, with the IC50 value being 7.7-fold
higher than that of 5-Fu (IC50 =14.7 μM). DHP 5b showed higher cytotoxicities against RKO, HeLa, and A549
cells than MCF-7, with IC50 values one to 6-fold higher
than that of 5-Fu. Moreover, DHP 5q demonstrated the
best antiproliferative activity (IC50 = 0.8 μM) against
the RKO cell line. DHPs 5c and 5r–5t showed satisfactory antiproliferative activities against all of
the tested cancer cells.

Based on the above primary antiproliferative
activities, the structure–activity
relationship of 5 was discussed. As for R4, 4-CF3Ph is in favor of the antiproliferative activities
against the four cell lines (2.7–4.6 μM) than other groups
(comparing 5c and 5a–5h except 5c). Very interestingly, the combination of
3-MeO and 4-OH functional groups at phenyl shows excellent selectivity
to the RKO cell line (5h, 2.4 μM). However, 4-OH
(5d, 91.5 μM), 3-MeO (5e, >100
μM),
4-MeO (5f, 34.6 μM), and the combination of 4-MeO
and 3-OH (5g, 60.7 μM) show much lower or almost
no activities to the RKO cell line. Therefore, using R4 = 3-MeO-4-OHPh and R1 = Et, the influences of R2 and R3 on the selectivity were investigated (5i–5q). It can be seen that except 5o and 5p with alkyl R2 and R3,
others with aryl R2 and R3 show much higher
activity against the RKO cell line than the other three cell lines,
with the combination of R2 = Ph and R3 = 3-ClPh
optimal (5q) against RKO cells. Unexpectedly, only changing
R1 from Et (5i, 5l, and 5n) to Me (5r–5t) leads to a significant
decrease of the selectivity with the increase of the activities against
all cell lines. This means that R1 is also a very important
group. The obtained experimental results indicate that R4 = 3-MeO-4-OHPh is crucial for the antiproliferative activities against
RKO cells and the influences of R1–R3 depend on their combinations.

To understand the primary mechanism
of action, the most potent
DHP 5q against RKO cells was used to investigate the
effects on the cell cycle distribution and apoptosis in RKO cells
via flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 2A, DHP 5q arrested the RKO cells at the
G0/G1 phase in a dose-dependent manner and induced the increase of
RKO cells at the G0/G1 phase from 31.33% (the blank control group)
to 59.81% (5 μM). Concurrently, a reduction of RKO cells at
G2/M and S phases was observed. The apoptotic effect of DHP 5q was investigated by Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide analyses,
using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the control. As shown in Figure 2B, DHP 5q induced 30% apoptosis at higher concentrations.

Figure 2 (A) Effects of 5q on cell cycle distribution in RKO
cells. DMSO (0.1%) was used as the control. (B) Annexin V-FITC/propidium
iodide analyses on the apoptosis of RKO cells 48 h after co-culturing
with compound 5q. The four quadrants were identified
as follows: viable (Q4), early apoptotic (Q3), late apoptotic (Q2),
and necrosis (Q1). DMSO (0.1%) was used as the control.

It is well known that D-type cyclins (cyclins D1, D2, and
D3) are
involved in the regulation of apoptosis and cell cycle progression
from the G0/G1-phase into the S phase.19 Overexpression of Cyclin D1 has been reported to be associated with
shorter survival in patients, and its high expression generally increases
migration and invasion of tumors.20 The
tumor suppressor, p53 protein, could induce tumor apoptosis and cell
cycle arrest.21 p21 is considered as an
independent prognostic parameter for colorectal cancer, and its overexpression
is positively correlated with the survival time of patients, which
may be related to the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation by blocking
the cell cycle in the G1 phase.22 Therefore,
the effect of DHP 5q on p53, p21, and cyclin D1 was investigated
to explore the mechanism of 5q that induced the G0/G1-phase
arrest. As shown in Figure 3, the expression of p53 and p21 proteins was increased by
the presence of DHP 5q (5 μM), while the expression
of cyclin D1 was inhibited (5 μM), which is consistent with
the results of the cell cycle and apoptosis assay.

of cell cycle protein (p53, p21, and cyclin
D1) in RKO cells after treatment with compound 5q for
48 h.

Conclusions
Twenty DHPs 5a–5t (all are new
compounds except 5a) were designed and synthesized for
their bioactivity evaluation against four human cancer cell lines
(MCF-7, RKO, HeLa, and A549). It was found that R4 = 3-MeO-4-OH-Ph
is a crucial group for increasing cytotoxicities against RKO cells
and the influences of R1–R3 depend on
their combination, with the most potent DHP 5q against
RKO cells (IC50 = 0.8 μM) and three potent DHPs (5r–5t) against four studied cancer cell
lines (IC50 = 0.9–3.9 μM) containing 3-MeO-4-OH-Ph
as the R4 group. Interestingly, the study on the primary
mechanism of 5q against RKO cells proves 5q as a G0/G1-phase arresting agent inducing cell apoptosis by decreasing
the levels of cyclin D1 but increasing the levels of p53 and p21 in
RKO cells. The advantages of an efficient synthetic method, simple
molecular structure, and potential antiproliferative activity against
multiple cancer cell lines are expected to make the most potent anticancer
DHPs 5a (1.9 μM), 5q (0.8 μM),
and 5s (0.9–2.4 μM) against A549, RKO, and
all studied four cell lines, respectively, attractive lead compounds
for developing potential selective or broad spectrum anticancer agents.

Experimental
Section
General Procedures for the Synthesis of Pentasubstituted 2,5-Dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-ones 5a–5t
Pentasubstituted 2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-ones 5a–5t were synthesized as reported in
our previous work.13 The reactions were
run with the following steps: (a) but-2-ynedioates (1 mmol) and amines
(R2NH2, 1 mmol) were added into test tube A
with 3 mL of MeOH and kept at room temperature for 30 min; (b) amines
(R3NH2, 1.6 mmol), aldehydes (3.5 mmol), salicylic
acid (0.3 mmol), and Cu(OAc)2·H2O (0.4
mmol) were added into test tube B with 3 mL of MeOH, and then the
mixture in tube B was added into the above mixture in tube A and stirred
at room temperature for desired time. After completion of the reactions,
the product mixture was purified by preparative thin layer chromatography
with petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (15:1–3:1) as the eluent
to afford the desired products. It is worth mentioning that the procedures
for the synthesis of 5o and 5p are the same
as those mentioned above except EtOH and 70 °C, instead of MeOH
and room temperature, were used as solvent and temperature, respectively.

Cell Culture
The human breast cancer MCF-7, colon cancer
RKO, cervical cancer HeLa, and nonsmall cell lung cancer A549 were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). All cells were
maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco) with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Capricorn Scientific GmbH, Germany) at 37 °C in a humidified
incubator with 5% CO2.

Cell Proliferation Assay
MTT assay is a quantitative
colorimetric method for the determination of cell survival and proliferation.23,24 The assessed parameter is the metabolic activity of viable cells.
Metabolically active cells reduce pale yellow tetrazolium salt (MTT)
(Sigma) to a dark blue water-insoluble formazan, which can be directly
quantified after solubilization with DMSO. The absorbance of the formazan
directly correlates with the number of viable cells. Cells were plated
at a density of 2 × 103 cells/well in 96-well plates.
On the following day, the cells were incubated with tested compounds
for at least three cell doublings. At the end of the treatment period,
10 μL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) was added and incubated for
another 4 h. After the supernatant was carefully removed, 150 μL
of DMSO was added for solubilization for about 10 min and the absorbance
at 570 nm was measured using a microplate spectrophotometer (Benchmark
Plus, Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA).25 5-Fluorouracil
was used as a reference drug and tested under similar conditions.
The inhibition percentage was calculated using the formula: Inhibition%
= [(Ac – As)/(Ac – Ab)] × 100%. (As: absorbance
of experimental wells containing cells, MTT, and compounds; Ac: control wells containing cells and MTT but
no compound; Ab: blank wells containing
only MTT). The IC50 values were calculated by use of the
PRISM statistical package (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).25

Cell Cycle Analysis
Flow cytometry
analysis was performed
as a reported method.26 Generally, after
24 h incubation, the cells were treated with compound 5q for different concentrations, respectively. Following treatment,
the cells were harvested, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) twice, and fixed in 70% ethanol at −20 °C for appropriate
time. The cells were then washed twice with cold PBS and incubated
with RNAase and propidium iodide (50 μg/mL) for 30 min at 37
°C in the dark. The percentages of cell cycle distribution were
analyzed on a BD LSRFortessa Flow Cytometer (BD Accuri Cytometers
Inc.; Ann Arbor, MI).

Western Blot Analysis
Protein concentrations
of cell
lysates were determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher).
Equal amounts of protein (30 μg) from each cell lysate were
resolved on Criterion TGX precast gels and transferred onto 0.45 μm
nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked and incubated
overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies: anti-p53 (#2527S,
Cell Signaling), anti-p21 (#2947S, Cell Signaling), anti-Cyclin D1
(#2978S, Cell Signaling), and anti-GAPDH (#5174, Cell Signaling).
After TBST washes (1× Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween-20), the
membranes were incubated with the corresponding horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins
were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence method (SuperSignal
West Pico substrate; Pierce; Rockford, IL).
