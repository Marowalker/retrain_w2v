Percolation of contaminated
water through paper sheets containing
silver nanoparticles is a promising way to provide emergency drinking
water. The silver nanoparticles are deposited by the in situ reduction
of silver nitrate on the cellulose fibers of an absorbent blotting
paper sheet. Sodium borohydride has been used as the reductant but
is toxic and expensive. Glucose is a benign alternative but is much
less reactive. In this note, we demonstrate an improved way to produce
silver nanoparticles in paper sheets by adding sodium hydroxide to
the glucose reductant. The silver content of the sheets, measured
by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, was around 2–3 mg of silver
per gram of dry paper. This was sufficient to reduce the concentration
of a model Escherichia coli suspension
after percolation through the sheet.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Paper continues to generate
interest as a renewable, cheap substrate
for practical point-of-use methods to purify drinking water in an
emergency. Two main approaches have been reported. The in situ reduction
of aqueous solutions of metal salts (and especially silver salts)
in the paper sheets leads on drying to metal nanoparticles strongly
attached to the cellulosic sheet matrix. When a suspension of bacteria
passes through the sheet, a large reduction in the number of viable
bacteria is observed, with minimal loss of silver from the sheet.1−4 A second approach that avoids the use of metal nanoparticles is
based on the modification of the fiber surfaces in paper so that negatively
charged bacteria5 or negatively charged
bactericidal copolymer micelles6,7 are irreversibly adsorbed
on positively charged paper surfaces. Both approaches exploit the
availability of paper-based sheets with a wide range of porosities
that can be used to control the flow rate and area available for interaction
with bacteria.

In the first approach, the silver nanoparticles
are attached by
the in situ reduction of silver nitrate on the cellulose fibers of
an absorbent blotting paper sheet. The aim is to achieve inactivation
of bacteria during percolation through the sheet, rather than by removal
of bacteria from the effluent by filtration.2 The sheets containing silver nanoparticles exhibit antibacterial
properties with minimal silver loss, indicating the promise of the
method. However, the use of sodium borohydride to reduce the silver
salt in the sheet2,3 is problematic, due to toxicity.8 To avoid this, glucose was suggested as a benign
reductant.9 No reduction was detected at
room temperature, but drying the sheets containing excess glucose
in conventional or microwave ovens resulted in the formation of silver
nanoparticles in the paper sheet.9 Successful
field testing of paper sheets containing silver and copper nanoparticles10 led to scale-up and commercial availability.11

Glucose or related reducing sugars are
clearly more benign and
more readily available than the original reductant, sodium borohydride,
proposed for the preparation of AgNP paper sheets. However, the reducing
sugars are less reactive than sodium borohydride and have been used
in large excess or at elevated temperatures to reduce the silver salts
in the paper sheet. This has not proved to be a problem to date, but
it might be useful to find a simple additive that would enhance the
reactivity of reducing sugars for formation of AgNP on paper sheets.
On the basis of the report by Darroudi et al. that NaOH acts as an
accelerator in the reduction of solution-dispersed silver nanoparticles,12 we here demonstrate an improved way to produce
silver nanoparticles in paper sheets by adding sodium hydroxide to
the glucose reductant.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Reflectance Spectra of Dry AgNP Sheets
In a previous
work with glucose as an in situ reductant for silver
nitrate, the paper samples were heated and an excess of glucose was
employed to enhance the formation of silver nanoparticles in the sheet.9 Here, we examine an alternative way to enhance
the reductive effectiveness of glucose. In basic media, it is expected
that formation of the acidic oxidation products would be favored,
thus enhancing the silver-ion reduction. Darroudi et al. used NaOH
as an accelerator in the preparation of gelatin-stabilized silver
nanoparticles by reduction with glucose.12 The effectiveness of this approach to that of the in situ reduction
in paper was tested by adding NaOH to the glucose reducing solution.
The usual yellow-brown sheet coloration appeared at room temperature
but at much lower glucose concentration than that required for glucose
reduction without added base. Reflectance spectra for dried sheets
dipped in 10 mM AgNO3 solution with two different amounts
of added NaOH are shown in Figure 1. For equimolar AgNO3 and NaOH, the reflection
spectra show a broad peak at around 420 nm with reflectance of 20%
relative to a sheet without AgNP, in reasonable accord with the reflectance
of sheets where the AgNO3 was reduced with NaBH4.2 Increasing the concentration of AgNO3 with a corresponding increase in concentration of NaOH shows
the expected increase in sheet coloration, as shown in Figure 2.

2.2 Silver Content of AgNP Sheets
Each
60 mm × 60 mm square of the AgNP paper absorbed about 4 mL of
solution so that for a solution containing 10 mM AgNO3,
the maximum possible silver content in each dry sheet would be about
4.3 mg of silver per sheet or 8.6 mg of silver per gram of paper.

The actual content of silver in the dried sheets was measured by
acid digestion followed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The sheets
made with glucose/NaOH as reductant contained somewhat less silver
than those reported previously for sodium borohydride reduction2 and for heated sheets containing a large (<10-fold)
molar excess of glucose,9 as illustrated
in Table 1. While the
reflectance spectra and silver content of the papers produced by NaOH
are similar to those produced by other reductants, the size of the
silver nanoparticles observed by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) for two of the samples was somewhat larger and more polydisperse
than the dimensions usually observed (Table 1).

2.3 AgNP Eluent Properties
A suspension
of Escherichia coli strain K12 was
passed through the AgNP sheets, and the eluent was tested for viability
by measuring the increase in optical density of the cultured suspension
at a wavelength of 600 nm. Incomplete deactivation of the E. coli passing through the paper results in an increase
in optical density over time. Results are shown in Figure 3. The sheet made by immersion
in the lowest silver salt content (5 mM AgNO3, 5 mM glucose
+ 5 mM NaOH, giving a final silver content of 1.3 mg of Ag per gram
of dry paper) displayed no inhibition of bacterial growth (not shown),
being essentially identical to curve (i) for elution through untreated
blotter paper. Increasing the silver content in the blotter paper
to 1.7 mg of Ag per gram of dry paper resulted in some inhibition
of bacterial growth in the eluent (curve (ii), Figure 3). For blotter paper containing 2.9 mg of
silver per gram of paper (the highest silver content examined in this
work), the bacterial growth rate in the eluent was about 1/3 that
for the blotter paper without silver (curve (i)). While significant,
this is far short of complete inhibition (curve (iv)). Note that bacterial
growth in the first hour is inhibited to a much greater extent relative
to the silver-free eluent (curve (iv) vs curve (i)) than at longer
times. This suggests that elution through sheets with a threshold
silver content of greater than ∼3 mg of Ag per gram of paper
causes significant initial reduction of bacterial content but that
sufficient viable bacteria remain in the eluent to increase over time.
This regrowth may be enhanced by the presence of residual glucose
in the eluent.

blotting paper with different silver contents. (i) Paper blank, with
no silver; (ii) 1.7 mg of Ag per gram of dry paper; (iii) 2.9 mg of
Ag per gram of dry paper; and (iv) bacteria-free eluent.

The bactericidal effectiveness of the AgNP papers
depends not only
on their nanoparticle content but also on factors such as the flow
rate through the papers, the initial bacteria content, and the presence
of interfering compounds in turbid influent water.4,9

It remains unclear whether the silver nanoparticles provide a local
reservoir of silver ions in the sheet or direct contact between bacteria
and silver nanoparticles is required. Negatively charged bacteria
adsorb on positively charged surface-modified cellulose,5 and a similar electrostatic interaction may facilitate
the initial interaction with AgNP/paper.

3 Conclusions
Adding NaOH to the glucose reducing solution enhances its effectiveness
for the in situ reduction of silver nitrate in paper sheets. The effectiveness
of paper containing silver nanoparticles for emergency water treatment
in field tests10,11 suggests that further optimization
of benign reductants for silver salts in a paper matrix would be worthwhile.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
We used
a commercially
available porous lightly bonded blotting paper (Whatman gel blotting
paper grade GB003, ∼0.8 mm dry thickness as base paper sheet).
AgNO3 (s), NaOH 0.5 M, AgNO3 10 mM (aq), anhydrous d-glucose(s), nitric acid (70%), hydrogen peroxide (30%), and
Lysogeny broth (LB) powder were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and
used as received. E. coli strain K12
was kindly provided by Prof. N. Tufenkji, Department of Chemical Engineering,
McGill University. Laboratory deionized (DI) water was used for solution
preparation.

4.2 Preparation of Silver Nanoparticle
Paper (AgNP
Paper)
The blotting paper, thickness 0.80 mm, was cut into
60 mm × 60 mm squares. Each square was allowed to soak in 30
mL of silver nitrate solution of a given concentration for 15 min.
After the excess solution was allowed to drip from the sheet, the
paper squares were then immersed in 30 mL of an alkaline glucose reducing
solution for another 15 min, before drying under restraint in an air
oven at 50 °C for 2 h.

The initial AgNO3 solutions
were 5, 10, and 25 mM. The glucose concentration in the reductant
solutions (5, 10, and 25 mM) was the same as that of the silver solutions,
but NaOH was added to the glucose solution to increase the effectiveness
of the reduction. The molar ratio of AgNO3 to Glu was always
1:1, but NaOH was added directly to the glucose solution in two different
molar ratios; Glu/NaOH = 10:1 and 1:1.

The compositions of the
solutions into which the paper was dipped
are given in Table 1. For comparison, results are also listed in Table 1 for compositions employed in previous publications,
in which 1 M sodium borohydride2 and 1
M glucose with heating9 were used to reduce
the AgNO3.

4.3 Bacterial Growth Measurements
The
growth of bacteria in the eluent after passing through the AgNP paper
was estimated from the increase in optical density at a wavelength
of 600 nm (OD600), measured with a Cary 5000 UV–vis–NIR
spectrophotometer from Agilent.

E. coli was seeded in 100 mL of autoclaved LB (20 g per litre) and incubated
overnight by suspending the solution in a water bath at 37 °C
with continuous shaking of the flask. OD600 was then measured to confirm
that the colony had grown (the absorbance ranged between 0.73 and
1.12). The bacterial suspension was then centrifuged and the bacterial
pellet redispersed in 100 mL of autoclaved DI water. OD600 was again
measured before the bacterial suspension (aq) passed through a AgNP
paper under gravity. An increase in absorbance is assumed to be due
to growth of bacteria increasing the turbidity of the sample. After
centrifugation and redispersion in water, the absorbance ranged between
0.51 and 1.03.

After passage through the AgNP paper, the supernatant
was collected
for analysis of the silver content by atomic absorption (see below).
The bacterial pellet was separated by centrifugation, redispersed
in 100 mL of LB, and incubated at 37 °C with continuous shaking.
The OD600 was measured at hourly intervals to monitor bacterial growth.

4.4 Solid UV–vis Spectroscopy on Paper
Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was employed to confirm the formation
of AgNP in the paper. The percentage reflectance from the AgNP papers
was measured for wavelengths between 300 and 800 nm with a Cary 5000
UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer and diffuse reflectance
accessory. Untreated Whatman blotting paper was used as a blank.

4.5 Transmission Electron Microscopy
The papers
were imaged with transmission electron microscopy to measure
the size of the silver nanoparticles. Some of the surface material
of the paper samples was scraped off and deposited on copper grids.
This material was imaged using a FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit Twin 120 kV
Cryo-TEM and a Philips CM200 200 kV TEM coupled with an EDAX Genesis
EDS Analysis System.

4.6 Silver Analysis by Atomic
Absorption Spectroscopy
Nitric acid was added to the supernatant
liquid from the bacterial
growth experiment to bring the final concentration of nitric acid
to 2 wt %. The AgNP papers were digested by adding 5 mL of DI water
and 5 mL of nitric acid (70%) and heating at 40 °C for 30 min.
Then, 5 mL of hydrogen peroxide (30%) was added and heating was continued
for another 30 min at 40 °C. The suspension was diluted to 175
mL using DI water and filtered through a 0.22 μm Millipore filter
prior to analysis with a PerkinElmer AAnalyst 100 Flame Atomic Absorption
Spectrometer using DI water as the blank.
