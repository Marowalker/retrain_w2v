Water oxidation electrocatalyzed
by Ni2+ under neutral
conditions was investigated using various electrochemical analyses.
The addition of Ni2+ in a phosphate-buffered solution catalyzed
the oxidation of water, as confirmed by the detection of oxygen generation
via scanning electrochemical microscopy. A combination of cyclic voltammetry,
coulometric titration, and electrochemical quartz microbalance measurements
identified the catalysis as heterogeneous and the catalyst as a Ni-based
ultrathin (<4 nm) layer (“Ni-Pi”). Analysis of the
potential- and pH-dependency of the titrated amount of charge revealed
that the catalyst was deposited only under anodic polarization conditions
and was removed under unpolarized conditions; the catalyst may be
Ni(III) oxide, and its formation and oxidation appeared to be chemically
irreversible. The diffusion-limited nature of water oxidation catalyzed
by Ni2+ was closely related to the phosphate ions involved
in the catalyst formation and the accompanying catalysis. Although
the catalytic performance of Ni2+ alone was not remarkable,
it exhibited a synergetic effect with BiVO4 for photoelectrochemical
water oxidation, which can compete with Co-Pi-decorated BiVO4.

Introduction
A robust water-splitting
catalyst is fundamental for the effective
conversion of solar energy into chemical fuel (H2) via
electrochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting.1−3 In water splitting (2H2O → 2H2 + O2, ΔE° = 1.23 V), the oxygen evolution
reaction (OER or water oxidation, 2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e–) is known to be more complicated
than the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, 2H+ + 2e– → H2) and its slow kinetics limits
the overall water-splitting rate.2,4 Therefore,
using a water-oxidation catalyst based on earth-abundant elements
is essential for cost-effective production of chemical fuel; numerous
homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts made of transition metals
have been developed toward this end.5−9

Transition-metal-based catalysts are also frequently combined
with
photoelectrodes (p- and n-type semiconductors) to utilize solar energy
for water splitting.10 Neutral pH conditions,
rather than acidic or alkaline conditions, are favored to ensure the
long-term stability of photoelectrodes and metallic electrodes.11−14 However, transition-metal-oxide-based heterogeneous catalysts are
thermodynamically unstable and less active at neutral pH; accordingly,
most water-oxidation studies have been performed under alkaline conditions.15−18 Recently, Nocera et al.2,19 reported a cobalt phosphate
(Co-Pi) heterogeneous electrocatalyst that consists of amorphous cobalt
oxide coordinated with a phosphate ion. This catalyst displayed vigorous
activity toward water oxidation at pH 7 and triggered extensive research
on conjugating it with various photoelectrodes such as silicon,11,20 Fe2O3,21,22 WO3,13 Ta3N5,23,24 and BiVO4.25,26

In this study,
we evaluate the electrocatalytic properties of Ni2+ for
water oxidation at neutral pH. This is inspired by the
catalysis of water oxidation by Co2+ in a phosphate buffer.2 The electrocatalytic performance of Ni-oxide
heterogeneous catalysts has not been investigated under neutral pH
conditions, which is probably due to its thermodynamic instability;
there are only a few reports on homogeneous water-oxidation catalysis
(WOC) by Ni(II) complexes at neutral pH.27,28 Herein, we found an ultrathin (<4 nm) heterogeneous electrocatalyst
(“Ni-Pi”), and its formation amount varied with the
applied potential and pH. The formation of the ultrathin catalyst
was verified by electrochemical analyses that were so sensitive in
detecting the signals
from the monolayer adsorption of electroactive species or from the
tiny mass change (ng/cm2 scale) of electrode associated
with the electrochemical reaction when it is combined with a quartz
crystal microbalance. Electrochemical analysis was also used to investigate
the nature of the catalyst and the catalysis mechanism, which included
the irreversible reaction steps and the diffusion of phosphate ions.
Studying the catalyst nature is important not only for understanding
the WOC mechanism but also for successfully combining the catalyst
with a photoelectrode; decoration of heterogeneous catalysts on photoelectrodes
should be controlled with respect to the surface coverage29−31 and optical properties.32,33 In this study, we also
tested the catalytic properties of ultrathin “Ni-Pi”
in conjunction with a BiVO4 photoelectrode and investigated
the synergetic effect between the two materials.

Results and Discussion
The WOC by Ni2+ was examined under various pH conditions
(Figure 1a). At neutral
and high pHs, the evolution of an oxidation current on a fluorine-doped
tin oxide (FTO) electrode in an aqueous phosphate buffer solution
containing Ni2+ was observed using cyclic voltammetry (CV)
and compared to that in the absence of Ni2+.
The evolution of oxidation current with the addition of Ni2+ was negligible under acidic conditions (pH < 5) but started to
appear at pH 5.69 and increased in magnitude with increasing pH. When
the pH exceeded 10, which is outside the phosphate buffering range
(pH 6–8), the oxidation current increased continuously without
peaking. The emerging prewaves (black arrows, Figure 1a) at pH 11 indicate the formation of a surface
species; this must be the heterogeneous catalyst, Ni(III)Ox(s) or Ni(IV)Ox(s),
formed via Ni2+ oxidation. The same CV features were reported
in the studies on the in situ formation of Co-Pi2 and Ni-Bi.34 After repeated CV cycling, the surface peak
became more apparent and an appreciable amount of a brown-colored
surface deposit was observed concurrently with the apparent electrocatalytic
water oxidation (Figure S1a,b). X-ray diffractometry,
energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
measurements revealed that the deposit was amorphous and composed
of Ni, O, and P (Figure S1b–e).
Fe was not detected in any of these analyses (Figure S1c,e), indicating that the effect of Fe incorporation
is not significant in this study. An attenuated total reflectance
infrared spectrum of the deposit (please see the Supporting Information for the details of measurement) displayed
a distinct Ni(OH)2-group Ni–O stretch peak (680
cm–1)35 and a phosphate
P=O stretch peak (1020 cm–1) (Figure S1d).36 Moreover,
the P=O stretch peak was slightly shifted compared to that
of the ionic phosphate (Na2HPO4 or NaH2PO4, 1070–1050 cm–1),36 which indicates that the phosphate in the deposit
has a covalent character.37 These results
show that the deposit may be NiOx coordinated
with a phosphate ion; this is referred to as “Ni-Pi”
by analogy with Co-Pi. “Ni-Pi” and its efficient WOC
in alkaline solution have recently been reported elsewhere.38 A distinct color change in the surface deposit
was observed during potential scanning, with the deposit being transparent
at low oxidation potentials and becoming brownish and darker at higher
potentials (Figure S1a). This color change
corresponds to a phase transformation from a transparent Ni(II) species
(NiO, α-Ni(OH)2, β-Ni(OH)2) to a
brownish Ni(III) species (Ni(OH)3, β-NiOOH, oxidation
state: 2.7–3.0, porous) and probably up to the more dense γ-NiOOH
(3.7).39,40 The color change indicates a change in the
oxidation state of the deposited oxide, which is also intimately related
to the Ni2+ electrocatalytic water oxidation mechanism.

measured in Ni-free solutions at each pH. (b) Cyclic voltammogram

and the respective change in the current on a Au tip electrode (top)
held at −0.5 V during potential scanning of the GC substrate.
The small cathodic peak at −0.5 V in the inset is attributed
to the reduction of oxygen
absorbed on the electrode surface.

The Ni(II) oxide is thermodynamically unstable below pH 7.45
([Ni2+] = 2 mM) due to the following reaction41 1  After repeated
CV cycling, or continuous electrolysis,
with Ni2+ under these conditions, no visible surface deposit
or precipitate was found on the FTO surface (Figure S2a). The instability of Ni oxide at neutral pH was also confirmed
upon observation of the Ni-Pi film, which had been previously formed
at pH 11, fading away at pH 6.8 (Figure S2b). However, the evolution of an oxidation current at neutral pH is
still due to catalytic water oxidation. The peak current (ipeak) with 2 mM Ni2+ was 2.4 ×
10–4 A, which is about 40 times bigger than the
theoretical peak current derived from the Nernstian one-electron transfer
of 2 mM Ni2+ (Ni3+ + e– ↔
Ni2+) at 20 mV/s (ipeak, 2 mM = 6.15 × 10–6 A, where DNi2+ = 6.61 × 10–6 cm2/s42 and electrode area = 0.0314
cm2). A large oxidation current was also observed on other
substrates such as GC and Au (Figure S2c,d). The WOC by Ni2+ was verified by electrochemical detection
of the evolved oxygen using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM)
(Figure 1b); SECM has
been previously used to characterize electrocatalytic4 and photoelectrochemical23,43,44 water oxidation. Oxygen evolved on the GC substrate
diffuses to a Au disk electrode, located 5 μm above the GC substrate,
and arrives in a few milliseconds (t = d2/2D = 0.0125 s, where d is the distance between the tip and the substrate, which
is 5 μm, and D is the diffusion coefficient
of oxygen in water, which is 2 × 10–5 cm2/s45). The oxygen-reduction reaction
(ORR) current at the Au UME tip was monitored by holding the tip at
a constant potential of −0.5 V (vs Ag/AgCl), whereas the substrate
potential was cycled from 0.4 to 1.8 V. In the black SG-TC CV, a reduction
current was observed on the Au tip only when an oxidation current
developed with the positive polarization, indicating that the oxidation
current was attributed to oxygen evolution. Under the same condition,
the magnitude of water-oxidation current at the substrate and corresponding
oxygen-reduction current at the tip electrode increased significantly
with the addition of Ni2+, which confirmed that Ni2+ catalyzed the water-oxidation reaction. More vigorous evolution
of oxygen with the addition of Ni2+ was also found in gas
chromatography measurements (Figure S3,
please see the Supporting Information for
the experimental details), and it would be a quantitative evidence
for the WOC by Ni2+.

The CV response for Ni2+ WOC at neutral pH was investigated
at various Ni2+ concentrations, scan rates (v), and phosphate concentrations (Figure 2). The oxidation current increased gradually
with increasing Ni2+ concentration but did not vary significantly
above 2 mM Ni2+ (Figure 2a). A light-green precipitate, presumably Ni3(PO4)2, was found when >4 mM Ni2+ was added to the phosphate solution. The peak current was almost
linearly proportional to v1/2 (Figure 2b), which is a general
characteristic of diffusion-controlled electrochemical reactions.46 Moreover, the peak potential was shifted positively
with increasing v, which indicates that the kinetics
of the relevant electrochemical reaction is somewhat irreversible.46 Interestingly, no catalytic current was observed
in the absence of phosphate ions, and the current was proportional
to the phosphate ion concentration (Figure 2c). The negligible catalytic function in
the absence of buffer is similar to that seen for water oxidation
using Co-Pi47 and Ni-Bi34 heterogeneous catalysts. Shinagawa et al.48 studied the effects of the buffer on the reaction kinetics
and mass transfer of water splitting. Meanwhile, a tiny reduction
peak was observed on the reverse scan at 1.2–1.0 V (vs Ag/AgCl);
this peak correlated linearly with v (Figure 2d), which indicates that it
corresponds to a surface reaction. The total charge obtained via integration
of the surface peak was about 230 μC/cm2, which is
equivalent to a few atomic layers of electroactive surface species.
Contrary to the CV data at pH >10, the surface-peak magnitude did
not increase during repeated scanning (Figure S2a) or after continuous oxidation, which indicates that the
surface deposit did not grow further. This may be due to removal of
the deposit by a reduction reaction or due to the instability of Ni(II)Ox under neutral conditions.

and (c) scan rates (ν). (d) The surface-related reduction peak

The change in the electrode surface on a molecular scale
(e.g.,
adsorption, phase change, and underpotential deposition) can be evaluated
by electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) measurements.
Herein, we used an EQCM to observe the formation of a heterogeneous
catalyst on Au-coated quartz (Figures 3 and S4). Unfortunately,
Au-oxide formation and oxygen-bubble evolution were expected to perturb
the oscillation frequency of quartz, and two distinct changes were
observed during a potential scan in a nickel-free phosphate buffer
solution (black line); the slight increase in mass at potentials >0.8
V (vs Ag/AgCl) is attributed to the formation of Au oxide, as reported
elsewhere.49 The mass started to decrease
during the reverse scan at potentials >0.6 V, which corresponds
to
Au-oxide reduction, and eventually the mass was less than that before
potential cycling, which is attributed to the loss of Au. Bubble formation
was found to have a negligible impact on the quartz frequency. A catalytic
oxidation current accompanied the mass increase when Ni2+ was present, which indicates the formation of a thin heterogeneous
catalyst layer. Interestingly, a mass decrease (the removal of a catalyst
layer) was also observed during the reverse scan.

mass of a Au-coated quartz crystal during
CV. The electrolyte was a pH 6.8 phosphate buffer (0.1 M HPO42–/0.1 M H2PO4–) solution containing 2 mM Ni2+.

In general, the first step for resolving heterogeneity of
the catalysis
would be to search for an electrode deposit or nanoparticle formation
occurring during the water oxidation. However, this is difficult when
the nanoparticles are very small (<10 nm) or the deposit is unstable
under ambient conditions. Thus, distinguishing between homogeneous
and heterogeneous catalytic reactions is sometimes difficult and has
resulted in occasional scientific arguments.50−54 In addition, simply changing the pH caused a transition
between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyses by Co2+ in aqueous solution.55 Although we did
not detect a deposit spectroscopically in this study, our electrochemical
analyses clearly revealed the heterogeneity of Ni2+ WOC
under neutral conditions.

The peak-shaped CV and removal of
the surface deposit indicate
that the Ni-Pi-based heterogeneous catalyst (e.g., Ni(OH)2 or NiOOH coordinated with the phosphate), responsible for the enhanced
water oxidation, is unstable; this must be closely related to the
solution pH. As mentioned above, Ni(II) oxides are thermodynamically
unstable at neutral pH, and the higher-order oxides (Ni(III)Ox or Ni(IV)Ox) are
stable only when anodically polarized, as evident from the Ni Pourbaix
diagram (Figure S5). Accordingly, electrochemical
syntheses of Ni-based heterogeneous catalysts have been reported in
solutions with a pH ranging from 9.2 (Ni-Bi)34 to 14.15,17,56,57 The mass change in the electrode measured by the
EQCM was about 1.0 × 10–6 g/cm2.
Assuming that the species growing on the surface was NiOOH (the most
common oxide form of Ni(III) oxide) deposited via the reaction41 2  

and that it coordinates
with a phosphate ion and water molecules
(where its molecular weight ranges from 100 to 150 g/mol), the relevant
charge would be 500–600 μC/cm2. This is in
the same range as that of the charge obtained from the surface peak
in the CV measurements (Figure 2d).

The correlation between the CV surface peak and
the mass change
measured using the EQCM indicates that the surface species can be
titrated coulometrically. Variation of the amount of surface species
during CV was monitored by coulometric titration (with a 0.9 V vs
Ag/AgCl potential applied for 20 s immediately after stopping the
potential scanning), and the total titration charge was then calculated.
The amount of charge collected in the presence of Ni2+ was
considerably more than that collected in the absence of Ni2+, as shown in Figure 4a. The titration charge is plotted against the potential at which
the CV was stopped in Figure 4b. The charge collected in the absence of Ni2+ (black
square points) was very small (<1 μC/cm2) even
when there was a considerable oxidation current flow; the collected
charge in this case is associated with an electrical double-layer
charge and reducible species on, or near, the FTO surface (e.g., the •OH radical). Conversely, a noticeable amount of charge
was collected in the presence of Ni2+, and the amount of
surface species varied with the applied potential. At 1.3 V versus
Ag/AgCl, the collected charge increased rapidly during the oxidative
scan but started to decrease beyond 1.7 V. This trend resembles the
CV features, which confirms that the surface species act as electrocatalysts
for water oxidation and the change in the catalytic current originates
from changes in the amount of surface species. Nevertheless, the decrease
in the amount of heterogeneous catalyst during the forward scan is
unusual as continuous growth was expected. Figure 4c shows the potential- and time-dependency
of the amount of surface electrocatalyst. In this time span, the electrocatalyst
grew slowly at low potentials (<1.5 V), whereas it grew rapidly
at high potentials (>1.6 V), and eventually its amount reached
a steady
state. The steady-state values decreased with increasing applying
potential, and at potentials over 1.5 V, those were less than 46.3
μC (1470 μC/cm2), which corresponds to a 3.41
nm thick layer of NiOOH (mass density ∼4 g/cm3).

response during coulometric titration (0.9

scanning. (c) A plot of the amount of collected charge with respect

step. (d) A plot of the amount of charge collected at saturation versus
the applied potential prior to the titration step.

Interpreting the aforementioned unusual decrease,
or saturation,
in the amount of surface electrocatalyst requires understanding the
Ni2+ WOC mechanism. This would also provide a better insight
into the changes in the amount of surface species with respect to
the formation conditions. Related studies have suggested that the
catalysis of water oxidation by nickel oxides is based on the electrochemical
oxidation of Ni2+ (NiO or Ni(OH)2) to higher
oxidation states, Ni3+ or Ni4+ (β- or
γ-NiOOH), that then oxidize water and form Ni2+ again.15,16,18,34,58 Electrocatalytic water oxidation by Ni2+ can be explained in a similar manner, though the Ni2+ involved in electrocatalytic water oxidation is assumed
to be in aqueous solution rather than an oxide. Gerken
et al.55 proposed the water oxidation catalyzed
by aqueous Co2+ under low pH conditions. By analogy with
their work, we propose the following reaction pathway for heterogeneous
electrocatalytic water oxidation catalyzed by Ni2+ at neutral
pH 3.a   3.b   3.c   3.d   3.e   1a   net reaction:
3.f   3.g  We used nickel oxides Ni(OH)3 and
Ni(OH)4 in 3.b–3.e, respectively, from a thermodynamic point of view, though
the actual nickel oxides (β- and γ-NiOOH) has a nonstoichiometry
in elemental composition.
We presume that Ni(OH)3 (s) is β-NiOOH, where the
combination of eqs 3.a and 3.b is equivalent to eq 2. Equations 3.c and 3.d describe the transition
from Ni(III) oxide to Ni(IV) oxide via a proton-coupled electron transfer
(PCET) to balance the charge neutrality. γ-NiOOH is the most
plausible form of Ni(IV) oxide, and it can be thermodynamically expressed
as Ni(OH)4 or NiO2. It is known that the transformation
from β-NiOOH to γ-NiOOH is associated with an irreversible
structural change;56,59,60 thus, eqs 3.c and 3.d can be regarded as irreversible reactions. As
the solution was buffered with phosphate, the proton generation in eqs 3.b and 3.d was coupled with eq 3.g.

Ni(IV) oxide is very active toward the water-oxidation
reaction
in comparison with Ni(III) oxide;62 thus,
it would have a relatively short lifetime and we can assume that most
of the charge collected during the coulometric titration is associated
with Ni(OH)3 (that is, β-NiOOH). Subsequently, approaching
a constant titration charge corresponds to reaching the steady-state
activity (or coverage, θ) of Ni(OH)3 (dθNi(OH)3/dt = 0). Assuming that
the reaction in eq 3.c is electrochemically irreversible, dθNi(OH)3/dt can be expressed as 4  where kc°, Ec°, and αc are the standard
rate constant, standard reduction potential, and transfer coefficient,
respectively, for the reaction in eq 3.c.

Therefore, at the steady state 5  As Ni3+ was not detected at any
scan rate in our CV measurements (Figure S6) and it has not been reported elsewhere, we expect its concentration
to be very low, such that the rate constant for the backward reaction
of eq 3.b would be
small compared to that of the forward reaction. Moreover, the H+ concentration would be very small at neural pH. Therefore, eq 5 becomes 6  Although the surface charge
started collecting
at potentials >1.3 V (vs Ag/AgCl), the steady-state conditions
were
reached at a relative large potential (1.5 V vs Ag/AgCl) in about
100 s (Figure 4c).
Therefore, at steady state, the electrode is significantly polarized
toward the anodic reaction of eq 3.a. As the Ni3+ concentration would remain
low during water oxidation, the Ni3+ produced should be
immediately consumed and, therefore, the requisite conditions would
be 7  where ka°
and αa are the standard rate constant and the transfer
coefficient, respectively, for the reaction in eq 3.a. By substituting eq 7 into eq 6, we obtain 8  Equation 8 expresses the linear relationship between the logarithm of
the collected charge at steady state and the applied potential, with
a proportional factor of (αc – αa)F/RT. Figure 4d plots the steady-state amount
of the catalyst (presumed to be θt=100) against the applied potential. The analyzed potential range was
narrowed to exclude mass transfer effects. From eq 8, the negative slope of the plot of ln(θNi(OH)3,SS) versus applied potential over 1.5 V (vs Ag/AgCl)
might indicate that αa is larger than αc, whereby the reaction in eq 3.c is more favorable as the oxidation reaction, though
the estimated difference between αa and αc is as small as 0.1.

When the electrode is not anodically
polarized (<1.4 V vs Ag/AgCl),
the surface concentrations of Ni2+ and Ni3+ satisfy
the Nernst relationship 9  where Ea°
is the standard reduction potential of the reaction in eq 3.a. Combining eqs 6 and 9 gives 10  At low potentials
(<1.4 V vs Ag/AgCl),
the collected charge actually increased with increasing potential
and varied more significantly compared to the charge collected at
high potentials (Figure 4d). This is consistent with eq 10 where the proportional factor would be αcF/RT, though the collected
charges were not steady-state values. This analysis indicates that
the formation of Ni(III) oxide and its subsequent oxidation are electrochemically
and chemically irreversible. Accordingly, the removal of Ni(III) oxide
during the titration may not proceed via the back reactions in eqs 3.a and 3.b but via a different pathway consisting of electrochemical
reduction to Ni(II) oxide (eq 3.e) followed by dissociation (eq 1).

Charge from the surface deposit was
also collected in pH 5–7
electrolyte solutions at potentials where the oxidation current with
the addition of Ni2+ evolved; thus, the surface deposit
(catalyst layer) is related to the oxidation current (Figures 1a and 5). The collected charge and relevant catalytic current decreased
(Figure 5a,b) with
increasingly acidic electrolyte. Figure 5c maps the charge onto the potential-pH plane
(Pourbaix diagram). The boundary slope of the charge-collection region
is close to −177 mV/pH (3 × −59 mV/pH), which indicates
that the surface-species formation involves the generation of three
protons, such that the surface species would be regarded as Ni(OH)3 (or NiOOH) in eq 2. The boundary in Figure 5c is shifted positively from the theoretical boundary (E = 2.044–0.177 × pH V vs Ag/AgCl at 2 mM Ni2+); this might be due to the overpotential required to form
a Ni(OH)3 film on FTO.

Figure 5 (a) Cyclic voltammograms (scan rate: 20
mV/s) of FTO (surface area:
0.0314 cm2) and (b) the relevant charge collected, in a
pH 6.8 phosphate buffer (0.1 M HPO42–/0.1 M H2PO4–) solution of
varying pHs and containing 2 mM Ni2+. (c) The collected
charge mapped on the potential-pH plane (Pourbaix diagram).

Proton generation in an unbuffered
solution would decrease the
local pH at the electrode, which creates an unfavorable environment
for nickel oxide formation near the electrode. Indeed, the electrocatalytic
effect of Ni2+ was not observed under unbuffered conditions
(Figure 2b) and a buffering
agent is essential for Co-Pi and Ni-Bi formation.2,34 The
magnitude of the catalytic current as a function of the phosphate
concentration also reflects the importance of the phosphate buffer
in Ni2+-based WOC. Interestingly, Ni2+ did not
display a noticeable catalytic effect in a pH 7 tris buffer solution
(Figure S7). The coordination of phosphate
ions with Ni-oxide films at high pH is similar to the coordination
of cobalt oxides with phosphate and borate ions (Figure S1), which implies that the ability of the buffer ion
to coordinate to the solid deposit is also important in determining
the catalytic effect of the solid deposit; the phosphate ion is known
to mediate PCET through the catalyst.61 As phosphate ions play an important role in the catalyst-layer formation,
the decreasing amount of catalyst observed during potential cycling
might be associated with a change in the phosphate ion concentration.
According to the proposed mechanism, two dibasic phosphate ions (HPO42–, 0.1 M in the electrolyte) are consumed
during oxidation of a single water molecule (eqs 3.a → 3.e, two-electron
process), whereas Ni2+ is regenerated with a single turnover.
It is noticeable that the catalytic current peak (2.4 × 10–4 A) observed during CV is of the same magnitude as
that of the current associated with the one-electron reversible charge-transfer
reaction of 0.1 M reactant (3.1 × 10–4 A, Figure S8a). In addition, the chronoamperogram
of Ni2+-based WOC under anodic polarization is very similar
to the response expected from 0.1 M of reactant based on the Cottrell
equation (Figure S8b). These similarities
indicate that the diffusion of dibasic phosphate ions affects Ni2+-based WOC. The decline in the catalytic current after reaching
the CV peak may be due to the depletion of phosphate ions, which would
induce a decrease in the local pH near the electrode, producing conditions
that are unfavorable for catalyst formation. Considering the phosphate
ion diffusion can also explain the catalytic-current dependency on
the phosphate concentration (Figure 2b) and v1/2 (Figure 2c). Shinagawa et al.48 also emphasized the effect of buffering-agent
diffusion on the water-splitting reaction. Digital simulations of
electrocatalytic water oxidation catalyzed by Ni2+ would
provide a more clear insight into the CV features, but surface-related
heterogeneous electrochemical reactions are one of the most complicated
problems to simulate. Nevertheless, as phosphate-ion diffusion is
only partially involved in the electrocatalytic reaction and the surface
deposit is an intermediate rather than the final product, it is plausible
to consider the overall reaction as a diffusion-controlled ECEC route,
where E and C represent electrochemical and chemical reactions, respectively.
Simulations actually predicted emerging catalytic currents with various
scan rates and the phosphate concentrations, and they are quite similar
to the measured CVs (Figure S9).

We examined the interaction between Ni2+ catalysis and
photoelectrodes using a BiVO4 n-type semiconductor, with
the results presented in Figure 6. The photoelectrochemical OER increased upon addition
of Ni2+ in a phosphate buffer solution (Figure 6a). A synergetic effect was
also confirmed upon detection of enhanced oxygen evolution via SECM
combined with a ring optical-fiber disk electrode,62 as shown in Figure 6b. The synergetic effect can be understood by analogy with
the synergetic effect between n-type photoelectrodes and Co-Pi25,26 or Ni-Bi.63 We did not observe an increase
in the photoresponse upon adding Ni2+ in the presence of
a sulfite (SO32–) hole scavenger (Figure S10); this indicates that the synergetic
effect originates from improving the water-oxidation reaction kinetics
rather than modifying the physical properties of the semiconductor.
Likewise, improvement of the incident photon conversion efficiency
(IPCE) by Ni2+ was observed within the range of wavelengths
over which BiVO4 was active (Figure S11).

buffer (0.1 M HPO42–/0.1 M H2PO4–) solution containing Ni2+, with chopped UV–visible light irradiation (xenon lamp, 100
mW/cm2). (b) SECM chronoamperograms, collected in the TC/SG

generated oxygen by a Au ring electrode (top). Measurements started
in the dark, and UV–vis light irradiation started at 60 s and
finished at 120 s.

In general, the performance
of a heterogeneous catalyst is evaluated
with respect to the onset potential (or overpotential), and the stability
of the catalyst and the performance of Ni2+ in pH 7 phosphate
buffer are not very comparable to those of Co2+ in this
sense. When using a Ni2+ catalyst, the overpotential (η)
of ∼0.8 V was required to achieve a current density of 1 mA/cm2 (Figure S12) compared to η
= 0.4–0.5 V when using a Co2+ catalyst.2 Moreover, the turnover frequency for Ni2+ catalysis was roughly estimated to be <1 s–1 (at η > 0.9 V; please see the Supporting Information for detailed calculations), which is small compared
to the recently reported turnover frequency of Co-Pi (>2 s–1 at η = 0.41 V).64,65 However, when
the heterogeneous
catalyst is coupled with a photoelectrode, the onset potential for
the photoinduced reaction was mainly determined by the flat-band potential
of the photoelectrode; the role of the catalyst was limited to minimization
of the deteriorative potential shift originating from the surface
recombination.25,46 To synergistically interact with
a photoelectrode, the heterogeneous catalyst layer must be ultrathin
and discontinuous, such that it does not affect the nature of the
semiconductor–electrolyte interface.29,66,67 Recent studies have raised the issue of
parasitic light absorption by the heterogeneous catalyst decorated
on the photoelectrode and a subsequent loss in efficiency as the catalyst
thickness increases.32,33Figure 7 presents a comparison between photocatalytic
water oxidation by Ni2+ and Co2+ on BiVO4. The presence of Co2+ results in a higher photocurrent,
compared to that in the presence of
Ni2+, during the early stages of potential scanning. However,
the Co2+-decorated BiVO4 displays a significant
diminishing transient as potential scanning proceeds, with no increase
in the water oxidation current (Figure 7a). Moreover, as potential scanning is repeated, the
photocurrent becomes lower and is eventually lower than that of bare
BiVO4 (Figure 7c). This deterioration in the photocatalytic activity of Co-Pi
on BiVO4 has been reported previously44,68 and was attributed to thickening of the Co-Pi layer, causing an
increase in the surface recombination of the photogenerated electron–hole
pair.25 Abdi et al. reported that the synergetic
effect was maximized when the layer of Co-Pi on BiVO4 was
30 nm thick,68 and many studies have stated
that optimizing the thickness of the Co-Pi layer on the photoanode
is necessary.25,26,44,68 Conversely, the photo-oxidation enhancement
by Ni2+ was consistent and repeatable (Figure 7a,b). As the thickness of the
Ni-based catalyst layer is naturally limited to <4 nm (calculated
from the collected charge), it enhances the water oxidation without
any negative impact on the photoelectrode. With the exception of a
slight underperformance at low potentials, the catalysis by Ni2+ on BiVO4 was still comparable to that of Co-Pi
on BiVO4 even after optimizing the Co-Pi layer (Figure 7d). This indicates
that Ni2+ enhances the photocatalytic properties of semiconductor
electrodes without any pretreatment or optimization and, moreover,
the catalyst would exhibit a stable performance during water oxidation
because of its continuous regeneration.

(xenon lamp, 100 mW/cm2). (b–c) Changes in the photocurrent

of BiVO4 with the highest photocurrent achieved by Ni2+ or Co2+. In the case of Ni2+, the
photocurrent was measured in a phosphate buffer containing 2 mM Ni2+, and for Co2+, BiVO4 was immersed
in the phosphate-buffered solution containing 0.05 mM Co2+ with the potential sweeping from 0.2 to 1.0 V (vs Ag/AgCl) (four
times) under UV–vis light illumination, and then, the pretreated
BiVO4 was tested in a Co2+-free phosphate solution.

Conclusions
The catalysis of water
oxidation by Ni2+ under neutral
conditions was identified as heterogeneous using various electrochemical
analyses. SECM was used to probe the catalyzed oxygen evolution, and
CV and EQCM measurements revealed that the ultrathin (<4 nm) catalyst
layer was deposited only when the electrode was anodically polarized,
with no deposition observed under the nonpolarized conditions. The
amount of the surface catalyst present during water oxidation was
monitored by coulometric titration, and analysis of its dependence
on the potential and pH indicated the formation of Ni(III) oxide and
the irreversible kinetics of the catalyst formation and the following
water-oxidation reaction. The diffusion-limited characteristics of
water oxidation catalyzed by Ni2+ are associated with the
phosphate-ion mass transport. The electrocatalytic effect of Ni2+ on water oxidation was also observed on a BiVO4 photoanode, and a synergetic effect was observed.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (>99%), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (>99%), Na2HPO4 (>98%, ACS reagent),
and
NaH2PO4 (>98%, ACS reagent) were purchased
from
Acros Organics (Fair Lawn, NJ). Na2SO4 (99.3%),
Na2SO3 (99.6%), and ethylene glycol were purchased
from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (99.999%) and (NH4)10H2(W2O7)6·xH2O (99.99%) were obtained from Strem Chemicals
(Newburyport, MA). VCl3 (99%, Alfa-Aesar, Ward Hill, MA)
was used as received. FTO (<14 Ω, TEC 15; Pilkington, Toledo,
OH) was used as the working electrode in all electrochemical measurements
and as the substrate for photoelectrode preparation. The solvent in
all electrochemical experiments was deionized Milli-Q water (18.2
MΩ cm), and its impurity level was double-checked via conductivity
measurements (Orion Star A215). As Fe impurities have a profound effect
on the catalytic activity of Ni oxides,69−71 its presence in the
electrochemical cell was thoroughly controlled and the Fe concentration
level was estimated to be <280 ppb.

Electrochemical Analysis
A CH Instruments Model 631E
Electrochemical Analyzer was used for electrochemical analysis. For
the electrochemical measurements, a FTO working electrode was mounted
on Teflon cell with O-ring, which defined the surface area of 0.0314
cm2. A platinum wire (1 mm diameter) counter electrode
and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode in a saturated KCl solution were
used to complete the three-electrode configuration. A Au disk (2 mm
diameter) and a glassy carbon disk (GC, 4 mm diameter) were also used
as working electrodes. The electrolyte was composed of 0.2 M sodium
phosphate (HPO42–/H2PO4– = 1:1, pH 6.8), 0.1 M sodium sulfate,
and varying concentrations of nickel nitrate. Prior to the electrochemical
measurement, the electrolyte was purged with N2 flow for
at least 15 min to remove the oxygen dissolved in the electrolyte.
An EQCM (Q-Sense Explorer) was used to measure the change in electrode
mass. A Au-coated quartz crystal was used as the working electrode
(exposed area = 1 cm2), and its mass change (Δm in g/cm2) was estimated from the change in
frequency (Δf in Hz) using the following equation 11  where Cf is the
sensitivity factor for the crystal, which is 56.6 Hz/μg cm2 for a 5 MHz AT-cut quartz crystal at room temperature.

Preparation and Characterization of a W-Doped BiVO4 Photoelectrode
BiVO4 films were prepared using
a drop-casting method as reported elsewhere.43 Briefly, Bi(NO3)3 and VCl3 were
dissolved in ethylene glycol to prepare the precursor solution and
(NH4)10H2(W2O7)6·xH2O was added to
increase the photoactivity of the synthesized BiVO4 photoelectrode.
The concentrations of Bi, W, and V in the precursor solution were
4.5, 0.5, and 5.0 mM, respectively.43 The
precursor solution (200 μL) was spread over a 15 mm × 20
mm FTO substrate followed by thermal annealing at 550 °C for
3 h after heating up in increments of 1 °C/min, which produced
a ∼200 nm thick monoclinic W-doped BiVO4 film on
FTO. The photoactivity of the deposited BiVO4 was measured
in a 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.8) containing Ni2+ under UV–vis light irradiation (Xe lamp, 100 mW/cm2). All measurements were carried out in a borosilicate glass
cell, which has three compartments for the photoelectrode, Pt counter
electrode, and Ag/AgCl reference electrode that are separated with
a glass frit.

Detection of Oxygen Evolution via SECM
Oxygen evolved
from water oxidation at the working electrode was detected by a tip
electrode, positioned a few micrometers above the electrode, using
SECM operated in the substrate-generation–tip-collection (SG-TC)
mode.4,72 Two kinds of tip electrodes were used in
this experiment. A Au ultramicroelectrode (UME, dia. 10 μm)
was employed to characterize the electrocatalytic water oxidation.
To prepare the Au UME, a 10 μm dia. gold wire (Goodfellow, 99.99%
purity) was sealed in a borosilicate glass capillary (inner dia. 0.75
mm/outer dia. 1 mm) under vacuum. One end was then polished with 600-mesh
sandpaper (Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL) until the metal disk was exposed,
and it was then smoothed with 1200-mesh abrasive SiC paper and alumina
suspensions in water down to 0.3 μm (Buehler). A Au-ring optical-fiber
disk electrode was used to characterize the photoelectrochemical water
oxidation. It was prepared from a commercial Au-coated optical fiber
(Fiberguide Industries, Inc., Stirling, NJ) with a glass seal. The
tip position in SECM measurements was controlled by an xyz-stepper motor (T-LA28A; Zaber Technologies Inc., Vancouver, Canada)
on a SECM stage. The tip was gently touched to the substrate to make
initial contact and then retracted by 5 μm (the distance between
the tip and the substrate) using the stepper motor. Oxygen detection
was performed in a 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer solution with the
tip held at −0.5 V (vs Ag/AgCl) to induce the ORR, whereas
the substrate potential was scanned or held constant to induce the
OER. The tip potential was sufficiently negative to ensure the collection
of diffusive oxygen without any secondary reactions occurring, for
example, HER. The photoelectrode was illuminated with UV–vis
light via a tip-embedded optical fiber from a halogen lamp. The sizes
of the Au-ring optical-fiber components were as follows: inner diameter
of optical fiber, 200 μm; inner diameter of Au ring, 240 μm;
outer diameter of Au ring, 275 μm; and the diameter of the whole
optical fiber including the glass insulator, 600 μm.
