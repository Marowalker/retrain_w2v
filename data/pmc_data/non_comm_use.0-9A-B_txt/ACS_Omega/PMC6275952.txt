An improved and high
yielding three-step synthesis for the production
of 2-trifluoromethyl-10-aminopropylphenothiazine (TAPP) using less
hazardous and more inexpensive reagents, its coupling to Sepharose-4B
resin, and its ability to purify calmodulin are described. The overall
yield of TAPP, starting with 3-aminopropyl bromide hydrobromide and
2-(trifluoromethyl)phenothiazine, was 96%.

Introduction
Calmodulin (CaM) is
a calcium-ion sensing protein that is a major
translator of calcium signaling in cells. In general, CaM binds up
to four calcium ions when cellular calcium levels rise and can then
bind to and alter the function of many other proteins depending on
calcium concentration, cell type, and availability of its binding
target.1,2 CaM is composed of two lobes connected by
a central linker helix, often referred to as a dumbbell shape (Figure 1a). Each lobe can
bind two calcium ions, for a total of four calcium binding sites.
Upon calcium binding, the CaM central linker helix becomes flexible,
and the lobes wrap around the target to form a compact ellipsoid (Figure 1b).3,4 CaM binds to and regulates ∼300 cellular targets, involving
the protein in many critical processes, such as smooth muscle contraction,
intracellular movement, memory, and metabolism.3 Alterations in CaM regulation contribute to multiple disease
states, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease,
and Down’s syndrome.5,6 Because CaM binds to
so many proteins, it must be able to differentiate between targets
depending on its affinity for each, the cell type, and the spatial
and temporal nature of the calcium signal. Thus, the intricacies of
CaM’s complex regulation network are still being unraveled.

Figure 1 (a) Structure
of calcium-loaded CaM (PDB id 1CLL) (CaM, green; calcium,
gray). (b) Structure of CaM bound to the calcineurin’s CaM
binding region (PDB id 4Q5U) (CaM, green; calcineurin, blue; calcium, gray).

To structurally and functionally
investigate CaM, it must first
be fully purified, generally from Escherichia coli that have been engineered to make CaM. The most common method for
CaM purification is hydrophobic interaction chromatography via a phenyl
Sepharose resin. For CaM, this is actually pseudoaffinity chromatography
as its hydrophobicity can be modulated by calcium ions. When CaM binds
the calcium ion, its exposed hydrophobicity is greatly increased.
Unfortunately, phenyl Sepharose purification has drawbacks including
the necessity of two consecutive columns and frequent additional purification
methods such as ion exchange chromatography or heat treatment as phenyl
Sepharose alone does not fully purify CaM as determined by gel electrophoresis.7−12 Another method for CaM purification is the use of a 2-trifluoromethyl-10-aminopropylphenothiazine
(TAPP) Sepharose affinity resin.13−15 In our experience, TAPP
Sepharose requires only one column and fully purifies CaM from bacterial
lysate without any additional steps.16−18 Despite its superiority,
TAPP Sepharose is rarely used for CaM purification as it is not commercially
available. Instead, the TAPP molecule must be synthesized and coupled
to epoxide-activated Sepharose.

TAPP (1), along
with APP (2), CAPP (3), and TAPP-O (4) (Figure 2), is a structural class of 2-substituted-10-aminopropylphenothiazines
that act as CaM antagonists.13,15 When immobilized on
Sepharose-4B resin via an epoxide linker, they are capable of purifying
CaM through affinity chromatography.

CaM antagonists.

TAPP is preferred over
APP, CAPP, and TAPP-O because of its easier
purification and long-term stability concerning photochemical decomposition.15

Results and Discussion
Currently,
only one synthesis method is reported for TAPP in 1983
with moderate yields.13,14 The synthetic scheme (Scheme 1) calls for hazardous
reagents (acrylonitrile, LAH, and HCl gas), complicated reaction setup
(reflux, Soxhlet extractor), long work-up times (36 h), and difficult
precipitation.

Scheme 1 Literature-Reported Synthesis of TAPP
These reaction conditions make TAPP very inaccessible
to those
who need it for CaM purification, primarily biochemists with limited
organic synthesis training. Herein, we describe improved synthesis
for TAPP (Scheme 2)
using low-cost and safer reagents, as well as simple organic chemistry
reaction procedures and purification resulting in a 96% overall yield.
It is the hope that these changes will allow TAPP to be more accessible
for those who need it.

Scheme 2 Improved Synthesis of TAPP from 2-(Trifluoromethyl)phenothiazine
and 3-Aminopropyl Bromide Hydrobromide
In lieu of the highly reactive, volatile, and toxic acrylonitrile,
the aminopropyl arm was added via a substitution reaction with 3-aminopropyl
bromide hydrobromide (7). The terminal amine first had
to be protected, so 7 was treated with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in the presence of trimethylamine to yield 8 in 98% yield.19 Phenothiazine 5 was then substituted with 8 in the presence
of KOH to give boc-protected TAPP (9) in 90% yield. After
purification by flash chromatography (5% EtOAc/95% hexanes) 9 was deprotected using a 4:1 ratio of CH2Cl2 and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to yield TAPP (1) in 96% overall yield in three synthetic steps.

Not only did
adding the aminopropyl arm in this manner eliminated
the use of acrylonitrile and lithium aluminum hydride but also the
36 h Soxhlet extraction was also no longer necessary, greatly increasing
the ease of the synthesis of 1.

Attempts were made
to decrease the reaction time from compound 5 to 9 by changing the base and reaction temperature.
However, substituting NaH for KOH and/or increasing the temperature
all resulted in dramatically lower yields (35% or less). In fact,
as temperature increased, yields dropped substantially culminating
in a 1% yield at 100 °C. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis
indicated the reaction mixture at higher temperatures, as well as
using NaH, was made up of primarily 5, suggesting that 8 was not stable at higher temperatures or in the presence
of stronger bases.

Once 1 was successfully synthesized,
it was then immobilized
on Sepharose-4B resin (Scheme 3) using an epoxide linker.15 Sepharose-4B
was first activated with 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (10) in the presence of aqueous NaOH and NaBH4 by gently
stirring at room temperature. Once the activation was complete, the
activated resin (11) was washed, and 1 was
coupled to the resin (12) by its terminal amine in the
presence of 50% aqueous dioxane. The pH of the suspension was adjusted
to 12, and the reaction mixture was shaken at room temperature for
40 h.15

Scheme 3 Activation and Coupling of Sepharose-4B
and TAPP
Testing the binding
capacity of TAPP Sepharose with pure CaM resulted
in a 5.5 ± 1.3 mg CaM bound and eluted per mL settled resin,
a comparable binding capacity to the previously reported 5.7 mg CaM/mL
settled resin.14,15 Testing the purification ability
of 10 mL settled TAPP Sepharose resin with CaM-expressing bacterial
lysate resulted in 95 mg of CaM at ≥95% purity as assessed
by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
(Supporting Information). CaM purified
by TAPP Sepharose resin was compared to that purified by the more
common phenyl Sepharose resin. The purity of each CaM was assessed
by SDS-PAGE, and the activity of the two CaM types was compared by
its ability to activate the phosphatase calcineurin. The two purification
methods yielded CaM with similar ability to activate calcineurin while
TAPP Sepharose purification resulted in CaM of higher purity (Supporting Information).

Conclusions
Purifying
CaM for structural and functional studies is most effective
when using TAPP Sepharose. However, this method is infrequently used
as the previously reported TAPP synthesis was involved and had moderate
yields. With the efficient and high-yield method of TAPP synthesis
and coupling to Sepharose, we present here CaM purification by TAPP
Sepharose which will be much more accessible to those studying CaM.

Synthesis
of TAPP
tert-Butyl (3-Bromopropyl)carbamate (8)
Triethylamine (1.1 mL, 8.0 mmol) was added to
a 0 °C suspension of 3-aminopropyl bromide hydrobromide (1.8
g, 8.0 mmol) and dichloromethane (DCM; 30 mL). Di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (1.8 g, 8.0 mmol), dissolved in DCM (80 mL), was
then added dropwise to the 0 °C suspension, and the reaction
mixture was allowed to gradually warm to room temperature and was
stirred overnight. The reaction was diluted with EtOAc (50 mL), and
the organic layer was washed with 5% (w/w) NaOH (3 × 50 mL),
water (3 × 50 mL), and brine (3 × 50 mL). The organic layer
was dried over MgSO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure
to afford 8, a colorless oil, in 98% yield (1.86 g).
All spectroscopic data agrees with previously reported literature
values.19

tert-Butyl
(3-(3-(Trifluoromethyl)-10H-phenothiazin-10-yl)propyl)carbamate
(9)
To a suspension of potassium hydroxide (0.63
g, 11.2 mmol) and 8 in dimethylformamide (2.5 mL), under
inert atmosphere, was
added 2-(trifluoromethyl)phenothiazine (0.50 g, 1.87 mmol) in one
portion. After stirring for 16 h at room temperature, water (10 mL)
was added to the reaction mixture, and the subsequent solution was
extracted with DCM (3 × 10 mL). The combined organic extracts
were then washed with water (3 × 10 mL) and brine (10 mL), dried
over MgSO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The
crude product was then purified by flash chromatography (5% EtOAc/95%
hexanes → 20% EtOAc/80% hexanes) to afford 9,
a pale yellow oil, in 90% yield (0.72 g). 1H NMR (300 MHz,

3-(3-(Trifluoromethyl)-10H-phenothiazin-10-yl)propan-1-amine,
TAPP (1)
A 4:1 mixture of DCM/TFA (8 mL:2 mL)
was added to 9 (0.50 g, 1.18 mmol), and the reaction
mixture was stirred at room temperature. After 2 h, the solvent was
removed under reduced pressure, and the crude product was dissolved
in 5 mL of H2O and 5 mL of MeOH. The solution’s
pH was adjusted to 10 with 1 M NaOH and was extracted with DCM (3
× 5 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried over MgSO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 1, a pale
yellow oil, in 99% yield (0.38 g). All spectroscopic data agrees with
previously reported literature values.13

Coupling TAPP to Sepharose 4B Resin
Activation of Sepharose
4B
A 100 mL suspension of Sepharose
4B resin (20% EtOH/80% H2O) was filtered, washed with deionized
water (3 L), and dried until water no longer dripped from the funnel
(Warning: Do not let Sepharose 4B dry out, make sure it stays
damp). The resin (∼50 g) was then collected and transferred
to an Erlenmeyer flask and diluted in 1 M NaOH (30 mL) followed by
the addition of sodium borohydride (0.21 g). The activation of the
resin was initiated by the addition of 60% 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl
ether (90 mL). The suspension was then stirred gently for 8 h at room
temperature. After 8 h, the activated resin was filtered and washed
with deionized water (6 L) and dried until the resin was still slightly
damp (∼50 g).15

Coupling
of TAPP to Resin
A solution of 1 (0.50 g,
1.18 mmol), dioxane (25 mL), and water (25 mL) was added to the activated
resin (∼50 g), and the pH of the suspension was adjusted to
12 with 1 M NaOH. The suspension was then placed on a shaker at 50
rpm and room temperature for 40 h at which time the TAPP-coupled resin
was filtered and washed with deionized water (500 mL), dioxane (300
mL), deionized water (500 mL), 95% EtOH (500 mL), and deionized water
(2.5 L). The resin was dried until water no longer dripped from the
funnel (Warning: Do not let Sepharose 4B dry out, make sure
it stays damp).15

Deactivation
of Remaining Active Epoxide Groups
A suspension
of TAPP-coupled resin (∼50 g) and 2 M glycine (100 mL, pH =
9.6) was placed on a shaker (50 rpm, room temperature). After 24 h,
the TAPP-activated resin was filtered, washed with deionized water
(1 L), 1 M NaCl (1 L), and deionized water (1.5 L). The resin was
then stored in 20% (v/v) EtOH in a light-limiting bottle.15

Testing TAPP Sepharose for CaM Binding and
Purity
Testing CaM Binding Capacity of TAPP Sepharose
Prepurified
CaM (40 mg) in 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2 (TAPP loading buffer) was added to 5 mL settled TAPP Sepharose,
equilibrated with TAPP loading buffer, in a gravity column and was
allowed to flow through. The resin was washed with TAPP loading buffer
until the absorbance at 280 nm returned to the buffer baseline. CaM
was eluted with 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) (TAPP elution buffer) in 5 mL fractions until the absorbance
at 280 nm returned to the buffer baseline. Absorbance at 280 nm was
measured for the elutions to determine total CaM bound using an extinction
coefficient of 2980 cm–1 M–1.
Binding capacity testing was repeated twice more for a total of three
tests. CaM binding capacity was 5.5 mg CaM per 1 mL settled TAPP Sepharose
± 1.3 mg.

Testing CaM Purification by TAPP Sepharose
CaM was
expressed from the pETCaMI vector in E. coli BL21(DE3). The pETCaMI vector was a kind gift of Dr. Anthony Persechini
at the University of Missouri at Kansas City. Cells were added to
Terrific Broth (1 L) with 0.5% glycerol, 0.05% glucose, 0.2% lactose,
and 50 mg kanamycin and incubated at 37 °C and 300 rpm for 22
h. The cells were then collected by centrifugation at 6000g and 4 °C for 10 min, and the cell pellets were stored
at −20 °C until purification could be performed. For every
1 g of the cell pellet, 1 mL of 20 mM Tris pH 7.4 and 200 mM NaCl
were added, and cells were resuspended. 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, 0.5 mg/mL lysozyme, and one EDTA-free protease inhibitor
tablet was added. Cell resuspension was sonicated, on ice, for 20
s at 90% amplitude three times with 30 s on ice between sonications.
Lysed cells were centrifuged at 4 °C and 20 000g for 30 min, and then the lysate was filtered with a 0.45
μm syringe filter and CaCl2 concentration was adjusted
to 20 mM. Lysate was added to a 10 mL TAPP Sepharose gravity column
equilibrated with TAPP loading buffer and allowed to flow through.
The resin was washed with 40 mL of TAPP loading buffer three times.
CaM was eluted with TAPP elution buffer in 10 × 6 mL fractions,
and the absorbance at 280 nm was measured to determine total CaM bound.
CaM purity was assessed SDS-PAGE (Supporting Information).

Comparison of TAPP Sepharose-Purified CaM to Phenyl Sepharose-Purified
CaM
CaM Expression and Purification by Phenyl Sepharose
CaM
was purified by phenyl Sepharose resin similarly to previously
described.8 CaM was expressed, lysed, and
clarified as described above. After 0.45 μm syringe filtration,
lysate was adjusted to 2 mM EDTA, loaded onto a 10 mL phenyl Sepharose
gravity column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10
mM EDTA, and allowed to flow through. The column was washed with 15
mL of the same buffer. The combined flow-through and wash was adjusted
to 10 mM CaCl2 and loaded onto a 10 mL phenyl Sepharose
gravity column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and
10 mM CaCl2 and allowed to flow through (FT2). The column
was washed with 30 mL of 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM CaCl2 (W2); 30 mL 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2 (W3); and 30 mL 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM CaCl2 (W4).
CaM was eluted from the column with 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA
in 10 × 5 mL fractions. CaM purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE (Supporting Information).

Activity
of CaM Purified by TAPP Sepharose Compared to Phenyl
Sepharose
Calcineurin phosphatase activity against the small
molecule substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP)
was determined as a function of CaM concentration. pNPP was obtained
from MP Biomedicals, and calcineurin was a kind gift of Dr. Trevor
Creamer at the University of Kentucky. Reaction mixtures contained
30 nM calcineurin, 100 mM pNPP, and 0–120 nM CaM purified with
TAPP Sepharose or phenyl Sepharose in assay buffer: 100 mM NaCl, 50
mM Tris, 6 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol,
0.025% NP-50, pH 7.5. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 90
min, and pNP release was monitored by its absorbance at 405 nm. Each
reaction was performed four times for each CaM concentration and type
(Supporting Information).
