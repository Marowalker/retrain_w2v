A new methodology for definitively
evaluating the structural similarity
between different phases in an impartial manner is proposed. This
methodology utilizes a dimensionality reduction (DR) technique that
was developed in the fields of machine learning and statistics. The
basis of the proposed methodology is that the structural similarity
between different phases can be evaluated by the geometrical similarity
of pair and/or angular distribution functions that reflect the atomic-scale
structure of each phase. The DR technique is used for the analysis
of this geometrical similarity. In this study, the proposed methodology
is applied to evaluate the similarity in the atomic-scale structure,
as obtained from molecular dynamics simulations, between amorphous
CaCO3 and CaCO3 crystal phases in the presence
or absence of additives, namely, Mg2+ ions, Sr2+ ions, and water molecules. The results indicate that in the absence
of additives, the structure of the amorphous phase is closer to that
of vaterite than to those of calcite or aragonite. However, the degree
of structural similarity between the amorphous phase and vaterite
decreases if Mg2+ ions are present. This tendency is also
evident when Sr2+ ions are present, although these ions
do not influence the structure of the amorphous phase as strongly
as Mg2+ ions. In addition, the results indicate that at
a high water concentration, the amorphous phase is separated into
small particles by hydrogen-bonded networks of water molecules and
the structure of the amorphous phase more closely approaches that
of vaterite. The proposed methodology is widely applicable to the
evaluation of the structural similarity between different phases for
complex multicomponent systems.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
structures of noncrystalline phases, including amorphous phases,
have been studied for many years.1,2 Nevertheless,
many aspects of the structures of amorphous phases remain unclear.
For example, although a recent computer simulation study suggested
the existence of crystal-like short-range order in an amorphous phase,3 the degree to which the structure of the amorphous
phase resembles that of a crystal remains uncertain.

In nature,
amorphous phases are often formed as precursors to crystal
nucleation.4−7 Depending on the temperature, pressure, and presence of additives,
not only the formation of the thermodynamically most stable crystal
but also the formation of a certain kind of metastable crystal occurs
via the formation of a precursor. It has been speculated that the
structure of this precursor determines which kind of crystal is formed;
that is, a certain kind of metastable crystal may be formed if the
structure of the precursor resembles that of the metastable crystal.4−6 To test this speculation, it is necessary to elucidate the structural
similarity between a precursor and each of the stable and metastable
crystals.

CaCO3 is a typical material for the formation
of amorphous
particles as precursors to crystal nucleation.5−13 Calcite is the thermodynamically most stable polymorph of CaCO3 near room temperature at a pressure of 1 atm. However, the
nucleation of vaterite occurs favorably in the laboratory.9−13 Moreover, depending on the temperature and the presence of additives
such as Mg2+ and Sr2+ ions, the nucleation of
aragonite can also occur.9−13 Thus, the relationship between the structures of amorphous particles
and the crystals formed from these particles has attracted a great
deal of attention, as has the relationship between the ion clusters
formed in aqueous solution and crystal nucleation.14−16

To date,
several experimental studies on the structure of amorphous
CaCO3 (ACC) have been carried out. An experimental study
by Lam et al. suggested that the structure of ACC formed in an aqueous
solution containing poly(aspartic acid) resembles that of vaterite.5 This observation may be related to the fact that
the nucleation of vaterite is kinetically favorable in the laboratory.9−13 However, another experimental study by Michel et al. suggested that
the structure of ACC did not match those of any of the known CaCO3 crystals.8 In principle, it is
quite difficult to elucidate the atomic-scale structure of ACC by
experimental means alone.

Computer simulations, such as those
based on molecular dynamics
(MD), are valuable tools for investigating the atomic-scale structure
of ACC. An MD simulation study by Tribello et al. suggested that the
structure of ACC resembles those of vaterite and/or aragonite.17 Our previous MD simulation study also indicated
that the structure of ACC resembles that of vaterite.18 The results of these earlier simulation studies may also
be attributable to the fact that the nucleation of vaterite is kinetically
favorable in the laboratory.9−13

Notably, in the simulation study by Tribello et al., they
evaluated
the structural similarity between ACC and each of the CaCO3 crystals by the visual inspection of a pair distribution function
(PDF) for Ca2+–Ca2+ ions and the local
atomic arrangement only.17 Our previous
study also relied on the visual inspection of the Ca2+–Ca2+ PDF and an angular distribution function (ADF) of the angle
formed by the three nearest-neighboring Ca2+ ions for evaluating
the structural similarity.18 Because both
of these simulation studies provided the same results and were also
consistent with an experimental study by Lam et al.,5 it is believed that they give a reasonable insight into
the structure of ACC in real systems. However, even for pure CaCO3, 6 different PDFs and 18 different ADFs can be defined, and
different results may be obtained if different ADF(s) and/or PDF(s)
are used for the evaluation. Moreover, it is inevitable that evaluation
by visual inspection is influenced by the interpretation of the researchers.
In the ideal case, the structural similarity should be evaluated definitively
for all of the functions in an impartial manner. To the best of the
author’s knowledge, no methodology has yet been proposed to
evaluate the structural similarity in such a way. The development
of such a methodology would greatly contribute to the study of the
structure of noncrystalline phases in multicomponent systems.

This paper proposes a new methodology for definitively evaluating
the structural similarity between different phases using a variety
of distribution functions. This methodology utilizes a dimensionality
reduction (DR) technique, which has been developed in the fields of
machine learning and statistics.19−23 The basis of this methodology is that the structural
similarity between two phases can be evaluated by the geometrical
similarity of the distribution functions, and the DR technique is
used for the analysis of this geometrical similarity.

In this
study, the proposed methodology was tested by evaluating
the similarity of the MD-derived atomic-scale structures of ACC and
CaCO3 crystal phases in the presence and absence of Mg2+ ions and/or water molecules. The evaluation results were
consistent with earlier studies.5,17,18 Then, the methodology was also applied to the evaluation of the
structural similarity between ACC and CaCO3 crystal phases
at a high water concentration and in the presence of Sr2+ ions, which has not previously been studied.

2 Methods
2.1 Dimensionality Reduction
DR involves
the transformation of original high-dimensional data into low-dimensional
(normally, two-dimensional [2D] or three-dimensional [3D]) data without
a significant loss of information.19,20 Several different
algorithms for DR have been developed. In this study, multidimensional
scaling (MDS),21 principal component analysis
(PCA),22 and isomeric mapping (Isomap)23 were applied. These are all popular algorithms
for the visual representation of multidimensional data in machine
learning and statistics.16−20

A common feature of these algorithms is that when the 2D or
3D data obtained by DR of the original high-dimensional data are mapped
onto a 2D plane or 3D space, the data points for similar original
data are placed near to each other, and the data points for different
original data are placed far away from each other.19,20 Owing to this characteristic, the similarities and/or dissimilarities
between different multidimensional data can be analyzed by mapping
2D or 3D data obtained by DR of the original data. A popular application
of these algorithms is the evaluation of geometrical similarities
or dissimilarities between different objects, such as surface recognition,24 face recognition,25 and surface matching,26 in which DR is
performed for multidimensional data representing the geometry of each
object.

It is important to note that these DR algorithms are
based on distinct
underlying concepts. During the DR process, MDS preserves the interpoint
distances,21 PCA preserves the variance
of the original data,22 and Isomap preserves
the intrinsic geometry of the original data.23 These DR algorithms perform an eigen decomposition of a matrix.
MDS performs an eigen decomposition for the Gram matrix of original
high-dimensional data points using the Euclidean distance matrix,
which captures the similarity between the data points, and 2D (or
3D) coordinates of the original data points are produced using the
largest two (or three) eigenvalues and the eigenvectors associated
with the eigenvalues. PCA performs an eigen decomposition for a covariance
matrix produced by the original data points, and the original data
points are projected onto a 2D plane (or 3D space) formed by two (or
three) principle eigenvectors. The DR process of Isomap is essentially
the same as that of MDS, whereas Isomap focuses on the distance from
each data point to each of its K nearest neighbors
(K = 6 in this study). The outline of the transformation
of 2D data points into one-dimensional data points using PCA is schematically
shown in Figure S1. As an example of the
DR of multidimensional data points, the DR of data points representing
the geometries of simple line graphs is also shown in Figure S2. The details of these algorithms can
be found in the literature.19−23

2.2 Application of DR To Evaluate Structural Similarity
between Different Phases
The underlying concept of this study
was that the structural similarity between different phases can be
regarded as the similarity in the geometries of PDFs and ADFs between
the phases. Thus, MD simulations were performed for ACC and CaCO3 crystals. All 6 PDFs for pairs of Ca–Ca, Ca–C,
Ca–O, C–C, C–O, and O–O atoms (gCaCa, gCaC, gCaO, gCC, gCO, and gOO) and
all 18 ADFs for ∠CaCaCa, ∠CaCaC, ∠CaCaO, ∠CaCCa,
∠CaCC, ∠CaCO, ∠CaOCa, ∠CaOC, ∠CaOO,
∠CCaC, ∠CCaO, ∠CCC, ∠CCO, ∠COC,
∠COO, ∠OCaO, ∠OCO, and ∠OOO (PCaCaCa, PCaCaC, PCaCaO, PCaCCa, PCaCC, PCaCO, PCaOCa, PCaOC, PCaOO, PCCaC, PCCaO, PCCC, PCCO, PCOC, PCOO, POCaO, POCO, and POOO, where β
in Pαβγ represents the
atom at the corner of the angle) were created for each phase by analyzing
the MD simulation data. PDFs and ADFs for ACC including Mg2+ or Sr2+ ions were created by regarding all cations as
Ca2+ ions.

A definition for the nearest-neighboring
atoms and/or ions was required to obtain the ADFs. In this study,
the atoms in a selected atom pair were judged to be nearest neighbors
to each other if the interatomic distance, r, was
shorter than rmin, which was approximately
the value of r at which the first minimum of PDF
for the pair appeared. The values of rmin determined for all six PDFs are listed in Table 1. In the case that ∠αβγ
was asymmetric (α–β distance ≠ β–γ
distance), the value of rmin for the longer
of the two distances was used.

Table 1 Values of rmin for Each of the PDFs
 	gCaC	gCaCa	gCaO	gCC	GCO	gOO	
rmin (Å)	4.4	3.7	3.0	4.4	3.9	3.9	
The PDFs were analyzed over the range of r values
from 0 to 10 Å, and the ADFs were analyzed over the range of
the angles formed by three nearest-neighbor atoms, θ, from 0
to 180°. All of the functions were normalized such that the integral
of the PDFs over the entire range of r was equivalent
to that of the ADFs over the entire range of θ. To create multidimensional
data representing the geometries of all 6 PDFs and 18 ADFs, the geometry
of each function was represented by 50 discrete points at even intervals
along r for the PDFs and θ for the ADFs. Thus,
a group of geometries for all 24 functions was represented by 1200
discrete points at even intervals, that is, to afford 1200-dimensional
data. The 1200-dimensional data were transformed into 2D or 3D data
using the DR algorithm, and data mapping was performed for the data
for all of the ACC and CaCO3 crystals. The structural similarity
between ACC and each CaCO3 crystal was evaluated by the
distance between the data points, d, between those
phases. An overview of the proposed methodology is schematically illustrated
in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration
of the proposed methodology.

This paper assumes that all distribution functions equally
contribute
to the structural similarity. In some cases, particular functions
may only play important contribution to the structural similarity.
In such cases, the contribution of each function to the structural
similarity can be adjusted if the data representing the geometry of
each function is multiplied by an appropriate weighting coefficient.

2.3 Simulation Systems
Seven different
ACC systems were examined: ACC without any additives, ACC with water
molecules (the fraction of water molecules, fH2O, was 0.5), ACC with water molecules (fH2O = 0.9), ACC with Mg2+ ions (the fraction of Mg2+ ions, fMg, was 0.5), ACC with both Mg2+ ions and water
molecules (fMg = 0.5 and fH2O = 0.5), ACC with Sr2+ ions (the
fraction of Sr2+ ions, fSr,
was 0.5), and ACC with both Sr2+ ions and water molecules
(fSr = 0.5 and fH2O = 0.5). Hereinafter, these seven ACCs will be
referred to as pure ACC, W05-ACC, W09-ACC, Mg05-ACC, Mg05W05-ACC,
Sr05-ACC, and Sr05W05-ACC.

The simulation systems used for ACC
were rectangular parallelepipeds consisting of 432 CaCO3 for pure ACC; 216 CaCO3 and 216 H2O for W05-ACC;
216 CaCO3 and 2187 H2O for W09-ACC; 256 CaCO3 and 256 MgCO3 for Mg05-ACC; 256 CaCO3 and 256 SrCO3 for Sr05-ACC; 216 CaCO3, 216
MgCO3, and 432 H2O for Mg05W05-ACC; and 216
CaCO3, 216 SrCO3, and 432 H2O for
Sr05W05-ACC. The sizes of the systems used in this study were slightly
larger than those in our previous study.18 In our previous study, we confirmed that the structure of ACC did
not significantly depend on the system size. Therefore, the sizes
of the systems used here were sufficient for the purposes of this
study.

The simulation systems used for the crystals were also
rectangular
parallelepipeds consisting of 512, 480, and 448 CaCO3 molecules
for calcite, aragonite, and vaterite, respectively. Periodic boundary
conditions were imposed in all x, y, and z directions of the systems. As in the case
of our previous study,18 the vaterite structure
proposed by Wang et al. was examined.27

2.4 Potential Models
Following our previous
study,18 the CaCO3 potential
model proposed by Raiteri et al. was used to estimate the CaCO3 interactions.28 The interactions
of the Mg2+ ions were estimated using the Mg2+ potential model that we proposed in our previous study.18 The interactions of the H2O molecules
were estimated using the TIP4P-Ew model.29 The H2O–CO32– interaction
was represented as the sum of the Coulomb potential plus the sum of
the Buckingham potential. The H2O–Ca2+ and H2O–Mg2+ interactions were represented
as the sum of the Coulomb potential plus the sum of the Lennard-Jones
(LJ) potential.

In this study, a Sr2+ potential model
was developed in the same manner as used previously to develop the
Mg2+ potential model.18 Specifically,
the interactions of the Sr2+ ions were represented as the
sum of the Coulomb potential plus the sum of the Buckingham potential,
similar to the interactions in the Raiteri CaCO3 potential
model and the Mg2+ potential model. The charge on the Sr2+ ion was +2.0e. Following the development
of the Mg2+ potential model, the values of the constants A and r0 in the Buckingham potential
(=A exp(−r/r0) – C/r6) were determined
by referring to the parameter values proposed by de Leeuw et al.30 Specifically, the values of A and r0 for the Sr2+ ion were
set to be 26% smaller and 8% larger, respectively, than those for
the Ca2+ ion in the Raiteri CaCO3 potential
model, as in the de Leeuw potential models. Similarly, the values
of ε and σ in the H2O–Sr2+ LJ potential model (=4ε{(σ/r)12 – (σ/r)6}) were set to
be 26% smaller and 8% larger, respectively, than those in the H2O–Ca2+ LJ potential model. The values of
all of the parameters for the Buckingham potential and the LJ potential
used in this study are listed in Table 2.

Potential, UB(r) = A exp(−r/r0) – C/r6, and the LJ Potential, ULJ(r) = 4ε{(σ/r)12 – (σ/r)6}

To examine the suitability of the proposed Sr2+ potential
model for this study, the lattice parameters of strontianite obtained
from the Sr2+ potential model were compared with those
from an experimental study.31 The lattice
parameters from the Sr2+ potential model were obtained
by a 2 ns MD simulation of strontianite consisting of 480 SrCO3 molecules. As summarized in Table 3, the Sr2+ potential model satisfactorily
reproduced the experimental lattice parameters. Moreover, the hydration
structure of a Sr2+ ion was investigated using a 10 ns
MD simulation of a system consisting of 1 Sr2+ ion, 2 Cl– ions, and 502 water molecules. Figure 2 shows the PDF for the Sr2+ ion
and the oxygen atom (Ow) of a water molecule, gSrOw, in the present model. For comparison, gSrOw in the model proposed by Åqvist et al.32 and gSrOw in the
model proposed by Dang et al.33 are also
shown. Although the distance at which the first maximum of gSrOw appeared was slightly smaller for the present
model (∼2.5 Å) than for the other two models (∼2.6
Å), gSrOw was overall the same for
all three Sr2+ potential models. Thus, it was confirmed
that the present Sr2+ potential model was suitable for
use in this study.

Figure 2 Sr2+–Ow PDF, gSrOw, as a function of the Sr2+–Ow distance, rSrOw, in the present model. For comparison, gSrOw in the model proposed by Åqvist et
al.32 (red) and that in the model proposed
by Dang et al.33 (blue), which were created
by digitizing gSrOw shown in a paper by
D’Angelo et al.,34 are also shown.
Notably, in both the Åqvist and Dang models, gSrOw was created using the SPC/E model for water.35

2.5 Computation
The MD simulation for
each phase was performed at a constant temperature of 298 K and a
constant pressure of 1 atm. For each ACC, the MD simulation was performed
three times starting with different initial velocity distributions.
The total run of an MD simulation was 1 ns for pure ACC, calcite,
aragonite, and vaterite; 2 ns for Mg05-ACC, Sr05-ACC, and W05-ACC;
and 20 ns for W05-ACC, W09-ACC, Mg05W05-ACC, and Sr05W05-ACC. The
simulations were performed with dl_poly_2.20.36 The Coulomb interaction was calculated using the Ewald summation
method. The details of the MD simulation method were the same as those
described previously.15

DR of the
multidimensional data and the creation of the map of the data points
were performed with Python 3.637 and scikit-learn,38 which is a set of python modules for machine
learning and data mining.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Structural Similarity between
Pure ACC and
Crystals
Because earlier studies suggested that the structure
of ACC resembles that of vaterite,5,17,18 this study also focused mainly on the structural
similarity between ACC and vaterite. Figure 3 shows three 2D planes on which the data
points created with each DR algorithm for all of the ACCs and crystals
are mapped. The values of d between the data points
for ACC and calcite (d_cal), those for ACC and aragonite
(d_ara), and those for ACC and vaterite (d_vat) are listed in Table 4. All of the three DR algorithms indicate that for
pure ACC, d_vat is smaller than d_cal and d_ara. This result suggests that the structure
of pure ACC is closer to that of vaterite than to those of calcite
and aragonite, which is consistent with earlier studies.5,17,18

Figure 3 2D planes on which the data points for
each of the ACCs and CaCO3 crystals were mapped using the
three DR algorithms. It should
be noted that only the relative positions of the data points are meaningful
and the absolute values of the data points and the axes on the planes
do not have physical meanings.

 	aragonite	75.85	66.31	72.71	
 	vaterite	49.04	30.35	46.18	
Moreover, the d values calculated using PCA and
Isomap suggest that the structure of pure ACC is closer to that of
calcite than to that of aragonite. However, the d values calculated using MDS suggest the opposite result. Notably,
the difference in the geometries of the PDFs and ADFs between each
ACC and each crystal was very large. Thus, it should be noted that
when the similarity between two very different geometries is evaluated,
the result of the evaluation may depend on the precise method of DR
applied in the particular DR algorithm used.

Goodwin et al.
reported that experimentally synthesized ACC had
a nanoporous, charge-separated structure.39 The present simulation, which was performed using the simple CaCO3 and H2O models, might not reproduce the structure
of the experimentally synthesized ACC perfectly. However, in our previous
study, we checked that the distances at which the first and second
peaks of gCaCa appeared were the same
for both the MD simulation and the experimental study by Goodwin et
al.18 Thus, it is believed that the present
results of the structural similarity apply to the experimentally synthesized
ACC. In biomineralization, the existence of more than one ACC phase
has been reported.40 More detailed studies
are needed to judge whether the present results apply to the ACC phases
in biomineralization.

3.2 Structural Similarity between
ACC and Crystals
in the Presence of Mg2+ Ions or Water Molecules
The effect of Mg2+ ions on the structural similarity can
be examined by comparing the d values between Mg05-ACC
and pure ACC. The value of d_vat is larger for Mg05-ACC
than for pure ACC. This result suggests that the degree of structural
similarity between ACC and vaterite decreases in the presence of Mg2+ ions, which is consistent with the results of our previous
study.18

The effect of water molecules
on the structural similarity can also be examined by comparing the d values between W05-ACC and pure ACC. All three DR algorithms
indicate that d_vat is smaller for W05-ACC than for
pure ACC. This result suggests that the degree of structural similarity
between ACC and vaterite is enhanced if water molecules are present.
However, the differences in the d values between
them are small. This result is also consistent with our previous study,
suggesting that water molecules did not significantly influence the
structure of ACC when fH2O ≤
0.5.18

In addition to revealing the
effect of the additives on the structural
similarity, the present methodology can also provide insights into
the extent to which the additives affect the relative degree of structural
similarity between the three crystals and ACC. This can be examined
by comparing d_cal, d_ara, and d_vat for pure ACC and ACC with the additives. It is convenient
to use scaled d to examine the relative degree of
structural similarity. The values of d_ara and d_vat, each of which was divided by d_cal,
are listed in Table 5. Hereinafter, the scaled d is referred to as ds. If the value of ds between the data points for ACC and a crystal is smaller than unity,
the structure of the ACC is closer to that of the crystal than to
that of calcite.

W09-ACC	aragonite	0.94	1.37	1.14	
 	vaterite	0.61	0.63	0.73	
The ds values calculated using PCA
and Isomap suggest that even in the presence of Mg2+ ions,
the structure of ACC is closer to that of vaterite than to those of
calcite or aragonite and closer to that of calcite than to that of
aragonite, although the ds values calculated
using MDS indicate a different result. The ds values for W05-ACC suggest that the relative degree of structural
similarity for the three crystals is not affected by water molecules.
The ds values for Mg05W05-ACC, in which
the effect of Mg2+ ions and that of water molecules were
in competition with each other, also suggest that the same relative
degree of structural similarity as in the case of pure ACC persists
even in the presence of both Mg2+ ions and water molecules.
The standard deviation of the d values listed in Table 4 was less than 1%.
The relative degree of structural similarity between ACC and the crystals
did not change even if the standard deviation was taken into consideration.

Consequently, the present methodology provided qualitatively the
same results in terms of the structural similarity as that found in
earlier studies. Thus, it is considered that the present methodology
affords reasonable results for the structural similarity even when
Sr2+ ions are present (Sr05-ACC and Sr05W05-ACC) and when fH2O is very large (W09-ACC), which
have not previously been studied.

3.3 Structural
Similarity between ACC and Crystals
in the Presence of Sr2+ Ions
The effect of Sr2+ ions on the structural similarity can be examined by comparing
the d values between Sr05-ACC and pure ACC. The d values calculated using PCA and Isomap indicate that d_vat is larger for Sr05-ACC than for pure ACC (Table 4). This result suggests
that the degree of structural similarity between ACC and vaterite
decreases if Sr2+ ions are present, similar to the case
when Mg2+ ions are present. Although the d values calculated using MDS indicate the opposite result, the overall
changes in the d values for Sr05-ACC from those for
pure ACC show the same tendency as those for pure ACC and Mg05-ACC.
The ds values calculated for the three
DR algorithms also suggest that the relative degree of structural
similarity with ACC for the three crystals is the same for both Sr05-ACC
and Mg05-ACC (Table 5). Thus, the effect of Sr2+ ions on the structural similarity
is essentially the same as the effect of Mg2+ ions. However,
the differences in the d and ds values between pure ACC and Sr05-ACC are smaller than in
the case of Mg05-ACC. This result suggests that Sr2+ ions
do not influence the structure of ACC to the same degree as Mg2+ ions.

The density (the total number of ions per volume)
of pure ACC (∼0.0328 Å–3 at 298 K and
1 atm) is nearly equal to that of vaterite (∼0.0326 Å–3 at 298 K and 1 atm).18 However, the density of ACC increases if Mg2+ ions are
present (∼0.0345 Å–3 at 298 K and 1
atm for fMg = 0.5). This is because Mg2+ ions are smaller than Ca2+ ions, and, therefore,
the distance between Mg2+ and the surrounding CO32– ions in ACC becomes shorter than the distance
for Ca2+ ions. Thus, the formation of vaterite-like structures
in ACC is disrupted if Mg2+ ions are present.18 In contrast to Mg2+ ions, Sr2+ ions are larger than Ca2+ ions. In this simulation,
the density of ACC decreased if Sr2+ ions were present
(∼0.0301 Å–3 at 298 K and 1 atm for
Sr05W05-ACC). It is speculated that irrespective of the size of ionic
additives, if the density of ACC is deviated from its equilibrium
value, the formation of vaterite-like structures is disrupted. More
detailed studies are needed to confirm this speculation.

3.4 Structural Similarity between ACC and Crystals
at a High Water Concentration
The changes in the d values for W09-ACC from those for pure ACC are apparently
larger than those in the case of other ACCs (Table 4). The PCA and Isomap results indicate that d_vat is much smaller than that for pure ACC. The values
of ds_vat for all three DR algorithms
are much smaller for W09-ACC than for pure ACC (Table 5). These results suggest that if fH2O is very large, the degree of
structural similarity between ACC and vaterite is enhanced.

Figure 4 shows the
structures of W05-ACC and W09-ACC obtained from the simulation. Few
hydrogen bonds between pairs of water molecules were observed in W05-ACC,
indicating that most of the water molecules in this structure were
distributed as monomers. However, large hydrogen-bonded networks of
water molecules were formed in W09-ACC, and ACC was separated into
small ACC particles by these networks. This separation into small
ACC particles occurred because fH2O = 0.9 was much higher than its equilibrium value (∼0.5).41 It is speculated that the structure of small
ACC particles more closely approaches that of vaterite because each
small ACC particle has a large fractional surface area where the ions
have larger free volumes to rearrange into an ordered state than in
the bulk ACC. More detailed studies are needed to confirm this speculation.

panel). The light green, gray, and red spheres represent Ca2+ ions and the C and O atoms of CO32– ions, respectively. The bold gray lines represent hydrogen bonds
between water molecules (not shown). The existence of a hydrogen bond
between a pair of water molecules was judged using an energetic definition.42

3.5 Evaluation of Structural Similarity between
ACC and Crystals from the 3D Space
The differences in d and ds among the ACCs were
very small, especially in the cases of PCA and Isomap. Therefore,
it was considered necessary to verify the results of the structural
similarity evaluated using the 2D planes. To evaluate the validity
of these results, the values of d and ds obtained from the 2D planes were compared with those
obtained from the 3D spaces, which were also created using each of
the DR algorithms (Tables 6 and 7). The values of d and ds obtained from the 3D spaces were
different to those obtained from the 2D planes. However, for both
the 2D planes and 3D spaces, all three DR algorithms provided qualitatively
the same results in terms of the structural similarity between pure
ACC and vaterite and the effects of Mg2+ ions, Sr2+ ions, and/or water molecules on the structural similarity. In general,
the accuracy of the geometrical similarity between two objects analyzed
using a 3D space is greater than that analyzed using a 2D plane. However,
the present results suggest that the use of a 2D plane is sufficient
for evaluating the structural similarity between each ACC and each
CaCO3 crystal.

3.6 Evaluation of Structural Similarity between
ACC and Crystals from Each Function
An advantage of the proposed
methodology is that it is possible to evaluate the extent to which
each of the PDFs and ADFs contributed to the structural similarity
between ACC and each crystal by creating 2D planes for the data points
representing the geometry of each function. From the ds values on the 2D planes (Figures S3–S26), the functions for which ds_cal was the shortest, those for which ds_ara was the shortest, and those for which ds_vat was the shortest were investigated. The results
are presented in Table 8. As expected, the number of functions for which ds_vat was the shortest was larger than the corresponding
numbers for ds_cal and ds_ara.

Interestingly,
the number of functions for which ds_ara
was the shortest was larger than that for ds_cal, despite the evaluation results using
all PDFs and ADFs comprehensively indicating that the structure of
pure ACC was closer to that of calcite than to that of aragonite. Figure 5 shows the geometries
of PCCC and PCCO and the 2D planes for each of the functions. The functions for aragonite
show no clear peaks in the region of 30° < θ < 150°,
unlike for the other phases. Moreover, PCCC for aragonite shows an extremely high peak at approximately θ
= 173°. PCCO for aragonite also shows
an extremely high peak at approximately θ = 25°. Similarly,
high peaks do not appear in the functions for the other phases. As
a result, especially for PCCO, ds_ara became much longer than ds_cal. This result implies that large differences at only
a few parts of the geometries of PDFs and ADFs between two phases
greatly influenced the structural similarity between the phases. Comparing
the positions of peaks appearing in PCCC for ACC with those for calcite and vaterite, the geometry of PCCC for pure ACC looks closer to that for calcite
than to that for vaterite. However, the difference between d_cal and d_vat was not so large. This
was because the evaluation of the geometrical similarity by the present
methodology was affected not only by the positions of the peaks but
also by heights and widths of them. It may be arguable whether this
characteristic of the present methodology provides a reasonable evaluation
result of the structural similarity between different atomic-scale
structures. In addition, it may be noted that the number of functions
for which the ds value is the shortest
can also be a degree of the structural similarity between ACC and
CaCO3 crystals.

Figure 5 Geometries of PCCC and PCCO (upper panels) and the 2D planes
on which the data
points for pure ACC, calcite, aragonite, and vaterite, which were
calculated using the MDS algorithm, are shown (lower panels).

Earlier simulation studies provided
a reasonable insight into the
structural similarity between ACC and CaCO3 crystals, which
was evaluated only by visual inspection of a few functions and/or
the atomic arrangement.17,18 However, it is obvious
from the present results that if different functions had been used
in the evaluation, completely different results might have been obtained.
The structural similarity between different phases should be comprehensively
evaluated from many functions simultaneously. The present methodology
provides a means to evaluate the structural similarity in a comprehensive
manner.

4 Conclusions
A new
methodology for evaluating the structural similarity between
different phases has been proposed. This methodology assumes that
the structural similarity between different phases can be regarded
as the geometrical similarity of distribution functions between the
phases, and this geometrical similarity was evaluated using DR algorithms
developed in the fields of machine learning and statistics.19−23

To test the proposed methodology, the similarity in the atomic-scale
structure, as obtained from MD simulations, between ACC and CaCO3 crystals in the presence and absence of Mg2+ ions
and water molecules was evaluated by analyzing the geometrical similarity
of 6 PDFs and 18 ADFs using the MDS, PCA, and Isomap algorithms for
DR. The results indicate that the structure of pure ACC is generally
closer to that of vaterite than to those of calcite and aragonite,
which is consistent with the results obtained in earlier studies.5,17,18 The results also qualitatively
indicated the same effects of Mg2+ ions and water molecules
on the structural similarity as found in the previous study of the
author.18

Using the proposed methodology,
the structural similarity was also
evaluated both when Sr2+ ions were present and in the presence
of a high concentration of water molecules. In the presence of Sr2+ ions, the degree of structural similarity between ACC and
vaterite decreased, as observed when Mg2+ ions were present.
However, Sr2+ ions were found to have a weaker influence
on the structure of ACC compared with Mg2+ ions. When the
concentration of water molecules was very high (fH2O = 0.9), the ACC was separated into small
particles by hydrogen-bonded networks of water molecules and the structure
of ACC more closely approached that of vaterite.

Crystal formation
from ACC in the presence of Mg2+ and/or
Sr2+ ions is a key process that is involved in biomineralization,13,43−46 the development of functional materials,47,48 an enhanced method for trace metal uptake,49 and paleoenvironmental reconstruction.50 Water also plays an important role in crystal formation from ACC.41,51 The concentration of water in ACC varies49 and the sizes of ACC particles and CaCO3 ion clusters
formed in aqueous solution vary in the range from 0.5 to 500 nm.14,52 The present results may provide valuable insights into these phenomena
for application to real systems.

The present results may be
related to the fact that the nucleation
of vaterite is kinetically favorable in the laboratory.9−13 However, even though the degree of structural similarity between
ACC and vaterite decreased in the presence of Mg2+ or Sr2+ ions, the degree of structural similarity was greater between
ACC and vaterite than between ACC and calcite or aragonite. This result
does not explain the nucleation of aragonite from amorphous precursor
particles in the presence of Mg2+ or Sr2+ ions.9−13 More extensive studies are needed to elucidate the relationship
between the structures of amorphous precursor particles and the crystals
formed from these particles.

The key strength of the proposed
methodology is that the structural
similarity between different phases can be definitively and comprehensively
evaluated from many factors in an impartial manner. Quantitative evaluation
of the structural similarity depends on the DR algorithm used, as
a result of the differences in the precise method of DR used in the
different algorithms. Nevertheless, all three of the DR algorithms
applied here provided the same qualitative results in the evaluation
of the structural similarity of complex structures based on CaCO3. In conclusion, the proposed methodology is expected to have
broad application for the evaluation of the structural similarity
between different phases of complex multicomponent systems, in which
the structure of each phase is represented by many different distribution
functions.
