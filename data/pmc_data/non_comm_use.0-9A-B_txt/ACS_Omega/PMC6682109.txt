We
used a cesium hexafluorophosphate (CsPF6)-containing
liquid electrolyte for surface-patterned Li metal anodes and confirmed
that there is a synergistic improvement in the electrochemical performance
such as cycle performance and rate capability. For instance, the surface-patterned
Li metal maintains 91.4% of the initial discharge capacity after the
1000th cycle (C/2 = 0.8 mA cm–2 for charging, 1C
for discharging). When a large quantity of the CsPF6-containing
liquid electrolyte (600 μL) is used, the bare Li metal and surface-patterned
Li metal are more effectively stabilized in comparison with the case
where 80 μL of electrolyte is used, resulting in improved electrochemical
performance. Through systematic testing, we recognize that these results
are because of the self-healing electrostatic shield mechanism, which
is mainly dependent on the amount of Cs+ ions. A small
amount of Cs+ ions cannot effectively counteract the incoming
Li+ ions because they cannot form an effective electrostatic
shield on the protrusions present on the Li metal surface.

==== Body
Introduction
Commercialized Li secondary batteries
are Li-ion batteries, which
are based on intercalation chemistry (i.e., they use graphite as the
anode material), and as a result of extensive research and development,
these batteries are fast approaching their theoretical energy density
limit.1,2 Therefore, a new active material based on
new chemistry is the only way to solve this energy density issue.
Li metal has been considered a promising anode material owing to its
extremely high theoretical specific capacity (3860 mAh g–1), low density (0.59 g cm–3), and lowest negative
electrochemical potential (−3.040 V vs the standard hydrogen
electrode).3−6

During repeated plating/stripping, Li metal undergoes uncontrolled
morphological changes such as the formation of the dendrite, granular
Li, mossy Li, and finally, dead Li. Li metal anodes result in a reduction
in the Coulombic efficiency and present safety issues, including a
catastrophic safety failure accompanied by fire. This has prevented
their use in practical battery applications over the past 4 decades.7−11

Much effort has been made to suppress the uncontrolled Li
formation
during plating/stripping of Li.12−17 As an example of such efforts, we recently developed surface-patterned
Li metal that guides the Li-ion plating space to prevent uncontrolled
Li plating.5,13,18 On the other hand, CsPF6 has been reported as a functional
electrolyte additive, which can effectively control morphological
changes on the surface of Li metal by inhibiting Li dendrite growth
based on a unique self-healing electrostatic shield (SHES) mechanism.19,20 The detailed underlying mechanism of SHES has been thoroughly demonstrated
in previous CsPF6-containing liquid electrolyte studies.19,21−24 Consequently, we recently reported the effect of CsPF6 additives on surface-patterned Li metal when 80 μL of CsPF6-containing liquid electrolyte was used.25

In this study, we observed that the morphological
properties of
Li metal are largely dependent on the quantity of the CsPF6-containing liquid electrolyte. We found that 80 μL of CsPF6-containing liquid electrolyte did not form a smooth Li metal
surface as reported in the previous study.19 When we decreased the amount of CsPF6-containing liquid
electrolyte below 80 μL, we still observed the same phenomena.
This is why we compared 80 μL with the excess electrolyte (600
μL) used in most of previous studies reported by our group.
Adjusting the amount of liquid electrolyte is one of the subtle art
for Li battery manufacturers for guaranteeing the quality of their
product. Practically speaking, however, the quantity of the liquid
electrolyte used during the assembly of a unit cell may easily change
depending on the researcher experimenting. The excess amount of liquid
electrolyte is meaningless for practical use. Ironically, however,
excessive amounts of liquid electrolytes are used in much scientific
research and thus, should be carefully considered. We systemically
investigate the effect of the quantity of the CsPF6-containing
electrolyte on the electrochemical performance of the unit cells and
the surface properties of the Li metal anode using scanning electron
microscopy (SEM).

Results and Discussion
For the same
quantity of the CsPF6-containing liquid
electrolyte (80 μL or 600 μL), the surface-patterned Li
metal exhibited improved cycle performance and rate capability over
the bare Li metal (Figure 1a–d). This implies that there is a synergistic improvement
effect of surface-patterned Li metal and CsPF6-containing
electrolytes.

Figure 1 (a–d) Rate capabilities and cycle performance of
unit cells
(LMO/Li metal) containing (a, b) bare Li metal and (c, d) surface-patterned
Li metal, each with 80 and 600 μL of CsPF6-containing
liquid electrolyte, respectively.

The unit cells containing bare Li metal and surface-patterned
Li
metal showed improved cycle performance and rate capability when a
larger quantity of the CsPF6-containing liquid electrolyte
(600 μL) was used. These results are reasonable because a newly
formed Li metal surface subjected to uncontrolled Li metal formation
consumes liquid electrolytes to form a solid electrolyte interphase
(SEI).26,27 A larger quantity of the liquid electrolyte
can provide more Li ions and solvent to Li metal anodes.

The
surface morphological changes of Li metal were investigated
after precycling.

In the case of bare Li metal, the surface
of the Li metal in unit
cells containing 80 μL of CsPF6-containing liquid
electrolyte was filled with uncontrolled Li growth (Figure 2a,b). In contrast, the Li metal
in unit cells containing 600 μL of CsPF6-containing
liquid electrolyte showed a smooth surface morphology (Figure 2c,d). Considering the previously
reported results that the CsPF6-containing liquid electrolyte
effectively reduces the formation of uncontrolled Li during plating,19−21,28 the Li metal in unit cells containing
80 μL of CsPF6-containing liquid electrolyte is a
rarity.

Figure 2 (a–d) SEM images of the bare Li metal surface after precycling
when different quantities of the CsPF6-containing liquid
electrolyte were used: (a, b) 80 μL of CsPF6-containing
liquid electrolyte and (c, d) 600 μL of CsPF6-containing
liquid electrolyte.

In the case of surface-patterned
Li metal, 80 μL of CsPF6-containing liquid electrolyte
again did not show a uniform
surface morphology (Figure 3a,b). Uncontrolled Li filled the pattern holes, and flat Li
was formed sporadically between the surface patterns. In contrast,
the surface-patterned Li metal of the unit cells containing 600 μL
of CsPF6-containing liquid electrolyte showed a smooth
surface morphology, and the surface patterns were uniformly filled
with Li metal (Figure 3c,d).

Figure 3 (a–d) SEM images of the surface-patterned Li metal surface
after precycling when different quantities of the CsPF6-containing liquid electrolyte were used: (a, b) 80 μL of CsPF6-containing liquid electrolyte and (c, d) 600 μL of
CsPF6-containing liquid electrolyte.

The CsPF6-containing liquid electrolyte is composed
of organic solvents, Li salt (lithium hexafluorophosphate, LiPF6), and CsPF6. Considering this, it can be deduced
that the amount of components other than CsPF6 may affect
the morphological change of Li metal during Li plating. To confirm
this, a liquid electrolyte that did not contain CsPF6 was
used to monitor the surface change of bare Li metal after Li plating.
The morphological characteristics of Li metal operated with pure LiPF6 were almost identical for 80 μL (Figure 4a,b) and 600 μL (Figure 4c,d) of the liquid electrolyte. In both cases,
the Li surface was filled with uncontrolled Li growth. Considering
this, it can be deduced that the morphological change of Li metal
observed in Figures 2 and 3 solely depends on the amount of CsPF6 in the electrolyte.

Figure 4 (a–d) SEM images of bare Li metal after
precycling when
different quantities of the CsPF6-free liquid electrolyte
[1 M LiPF6 + EC/PC/EMC (5/2/3 by vol)] were used: (a, b)
80 μL of liquid electrolyte and (c, d) 600 μL of liquid
electrolyte.

The amount of Cs+ cations plays a vital role in the
SHES mechanism,19 which implies that the
amount of Cs+ cations is the key to determining the Li
surface condition during Li plating. Although the effect of CsPF6 concentration in the electrolyte on the morphological change
of Li metal during Li plating was discussed in a previous study,19 the effect of the quantity of the CsPF6-containing liquid electrolyte has not been considered in detail.
The latter is a critical issue that should be addressed because the
importance of the quantity of the liquid electrolyte has been underestimated.
For instance, specific information regarding the quantity of the liquid
electrolyte is rarely detailed in the Experimental
Section of battery-related studies.19 More practically, the quantity of the liquid electrolyte used during
the assembly of a unit cell may easily change depending on the researcher
conducting the experiment.

The effect of the amount of Cs+ ions on the SHES mechanism
is illustrated in Figure 5. Because of the lower reduction potential of Cs+ ions than Li+ ions, the Cs+ ions are accumulated
near the tip to form an electrostatic shield. If the number of Cs+ ions is low, they cannot form a stable electrostatic shield
and cannot effectively repel the incoming Li+ ions from
the protrusion (Figure 5a). As a result, Li+ ions will form uncontrolled Li growth
during plating. On the other hand, if the number of Cs+ ions is high enough to form a solid positive shield, the SHES can
effectively disrupt the uncontrolled Li formation and result in a
smooth Li surface (Figure 5b).

Figure 5 Effect of the amount of Cs+ ions necessary for the SHES
mechanism to stabilize the Li metal surface during Li plating: (a)
80 μL of deficient electrolyte and (b) 600 μL of sufficient
electrolyte.

Conclusions
A
large quantity of the CsPF6-containing liquid electrolyte
(600 μL) effectively stabilized the Li metal anode in comparison
with the case where a smaller quantity of the electrolyte was used
(80 μL). The formation of uncontrolled Li metal growth, such
as dendrites, mossy Li, and granular Li, was diminished by applying
600 μL of CsPF6-containing liquid electrolyte, resulting
in improved electrochemical performance such as cycle performance
and rate capability. Considering these results, it can be deduced
that a sufficient number of Cs+ ions is essential for the
normal operation of the SHES mechanism of CsPF6 to stabilize
the Li metal anode.

Experimental Section
Materials and Characterization
LiPF6, propylene
carbonate (PC), ethylene carbonate (EC), and ethyl methyl carbonate
(EMC) were purchased (battery grade, Enchem Co., Ltd., Republic of
Korea) and used as received. CsPF6 (>99.0%, anhydrous,
SynQuest Laboratories) was dried at 60 °C for 4 days under vacuum
inside the antechamber of an Ar-filled glove box. The CsPF6-containing electrolyte was prepared by mixing 0.05 M CsPF6 with a mixture of EC, PC, and EMC (5/2/3 by weight) containing 1
M LiPF6. Each step of the preparation process was performed
in the Ar-filled glove box (dew point below −70 °C).

Lithium manganese oxide (LiMn2O4, Iljin Materials,
Republic of Korea), conductive carbon (Super P Li, Imerys, Belgium),
poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF, KF-1300, Kureha, Mw = 350,000), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP, Sigma-Aldrich, Republic of Korea), and Al current collector
foil (15 μm, Sam-A Aluminium, Republic of Korea) were used as
the cathode. A polyethylene microporous film (ND420, Asahi Kasei E-Materials,
Japan) was used as the separator. The LiMn2O4 cathode was prepared by coating slurry consisting of 90 wt % LiMn2O4, 5 wt % Super P Li, and 5 wt% PVDF in the NMP
solvent onto Al foil. Surface-patterned Li metal (200 μm, Honjo,
Japan) was prepared following the same procedure reported in our previous
studies.13,18 The 2032 coin-type unit cells (LMO/PE separator/Li
metal) were assembled in the argon-filled glove box with different
quantities of the electrolyte (80 and 600 μL).

The morphological
feature of flat or patterned Li metal was analyzed
by a field emission SEM (FE-SEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan). The unit
cells were carefully disassembled in a glove box filled with Ar, and
Li metal was detached from the cell. Li metal was gently rinsed with
the DMC solvent followed by drying under vacuum (25 °C, 12 h)
to remove the residual electrolyte on the Li metal surface.

Electrochemical
Property Measurement
The unit cells
were cycled at C/10 (0.16 mA cm–2) followed by three
additional cycles (stabilization cycles) at C/5 (0.32 mA cm–2) in a constant current (CC) mode for both charging and discharging
between 3.0 and 4.3 V versus Li/Li+ using a charge/discharge
cycler (PNE Solution Co., Ltd., Korea) at 25 °C. This series
of processes consisting of formation and stabilization steps was defined
as precycling. After precycling, the rate capability of the unit cells
was evaluated by varying the discharging current densities from C/2
to 20C (CC mode, C/2, 1C, 2C, 3C, 5C, 7C, 10C, 15C, and 20C) while
maintaining the charging current density of C/2 (CC/CV mode, 0.8 mA
cm–2) between 3.0 and 4.3 V versus Li/Li+. The cycle performance of the precycled cells was tested between
3.0 and 4.3 V versus Li/Li+ at C/2 charge current density
and 1C discharge current density (CC mode for charging and CC mode
for discharging) at 25 °C.
