Two new triarylborane-based
o,o′-substituted 2,2′-bithienyls, BT-BNMe2 and BT-BNBn2, which contain BMes2 and NMe2/NBn2 groups at the 3,3′-positions, have
been synthesized. Similar to the o,o′-substituted biphenyl
analogues, BP-BNMe2 and BP-BNBn2, which contain BMes2 and NMe2/NBn2 groups at the 2,2′-positions,
the steric effect of the amino group has significant influence on
the conformation of the 2,2′-bithienyl skeleton. The boryl
and amino groups are located at the same side of 2,2′-bithienyls
axis with a short B···N distance (3.63 Å) for
the NMe2-substituted BT-BNMe2. On the contrary, the two substituents are arranged on the
two different sides of the 2,2′-bithienyls axis for BT-BNBn2, which is modified with bulky NBn2. Despite the remarkable differences in the steric structure, the
two 2,2′-bithienyls display fluorescence at close wavelengths,
which is in sharp contrast to the much red-shifted fluorescence of BP-BNMe2 than BP-BNBn2. The theoretical calculations demonstrated
that the two 2,2′-bithienyls have close highest occupied molecular
orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gaps in the excited
state, which firmly support the experimental results. Thus, the parent
main chain framework can exhibit great impact on the charge-transfer
emission of o,o′-substituted biaryls.

Introduction
Organic fluorophores
have found extensive applications in organic
light emitting devices, chemical probes, medical diagnosis, and biomolecular
labels.1 In the design of organic fluorophores,
one important issue is the fine-tuning of fluorescence emission wavelength.
To tune the fluorescence emission wavelength, the following general
strategies have been adopted, such as change of the parent π-conjugated
framework,2 choosing substituents with
a different electronic effect,3 and change
of substituent positions.2b,4 In our recent research
on a triarylborane-based biphenyl π-system, which contains an
electron-accepting dimesitylboryl (BMes2) and an electron-donating N,N-disubstituted amino (NR2) at the o,o′-positions of the biphenyl framework (Figure 1),5 it was revealed that the change of stereo geometry, which
is influenced greatly by the steric effect of the amino group, can
induce a remarkable difference in the fluorescence emission wavelength,5c which provides another novel way for the tuning
of fluorescence wavelength. For the biphenyl BP-BNMe2, which is modified with dimethylamino (NMe2), NMe2 and BMes2 are located at the
same side of the biphenyl axis with a short B···N distance
(3.59 Å), as indicated by its X-ray crystal structure. In contrast,
the boryl and amino groups are arranged on the two opposite sides
of the biphenyl axis in BP-BNBn2, which is modified with bulky dibenzylamino (NBn2). The
change of the amino group from NMe2 to NBn2 causes
a 71 nm hypochromic shift of emission in cyclohexane. Moreover, BP-BNMe2 is highly emissive in both
the solution and solid state with a rather long fluorescence wavelength
(λ = 521 nm in cyclohexane). The interesting properties of BP-BNMe2, and the great influence
of the amino steric effect on the photophysical properties prompted
us to turn our attention to 3,3′-substituted 2,2′-bithienyl
derivatives, BT-BNMe2 and BT-BNBn2, which contain boryl and
amino groups at 3,3′-positions of the 2,2′-bithienyl
framework (Figure 1). Compared with biphenyl derivatives, the emissions of bithienyl
compounds were initially expected to shift to longer wavelength. Furthermore,
the 5,5′-positions of 2,2′-bithienyl are easily functionalized,
which would make it possible to further tune the emission properties
by attachment of extra substituents. A large shift of 72 nm in emission
was in fact observed from BP-BNBn2 to BT-BNBn2 for the NBn2-substituted derivatives, just as expected. However, the NMe2-substituted compounds, BP-BNMe2 and BT-BNMe2, emit fluorescence
at almost the same maximum wavelengths. As a result, the emissions
of two bithienyl derivatives are very close, which naturally evoked
a question why the two π-systems display emissions in such a
completely different manner. The elucidation of this point will lay
a great foundation for the fine-tuning of the emission wavelength.
Herein, the X-ray single-crystal structures, photophysical properties,
and theoretically calculated structures in the ground state and excited
states of the two bithienyl compounds were fully characterized to
investigate the impact of the 2,2′-bithienyl parent framework
on the photophysical properties.

and (b) 2,2′-bithienyls.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
The two target 2,2′-bithienyl
derivatives
were easily prepared in four steps starting from the commercially
available 3,3′-dibromo-2,2′-bithienyl (Scheme 1). The first Pd(0)-catalyzed
monocoupling with benzophenone imine and subsequent hydrolysis with
concentrated hydrochloric acid afforded the main synthetic intermediate
3-amino-3′-bromo-2,2′-bithienyl (BT-BrNH2).6 The following
N-methylation and N-benzylation of the amino group with methyl iodide
and benzyl bromide gave the bromide precursors, BT-BrNMe2 and BT-BrNBn2, respectively. Finally, BT-BNMe2 and BT-BNBn2 were obtained
by the lithiation of the corresponding bromide precursors followed
by quenching with dimesitylfluoroborane. All the reactions went successfully
with yields ranging from 65 to 99%. These two triarylborane-based
2,2′-bithienyl derivatives are stable to air either in the
solution or in solid state, and their structures were confirmed by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy, high-resolution
mass spectrometry, and X-ray diffraction analysis.

Regarding the X-ray crystal structures, BT-BNMe2 and BT-BNBn2 display some characteristics similar to the
corresponding biphenyl
derivatives. (1) The conformations of the bithienyl skeleton are also
totally different. For BT-BNMe2, which is substituted with less bulky NMe2, the amino
and boryl groups are located at the same side of bithienyl axis. The
distance between boron and nitrogen centers is 3.63 Å, which
implies the existence of some attractive B–N interactions.
In contrast, the amino and boryl groups are arranged at two different
sides of the bithienyl axis in BT-BNBn2, which is substituted by more bulky NBn2. Owing
to the greater steric congestion in BT-BNMe2, the bithienyl framework is more twisted than BT-BNBn2 (dihedral angle between P1
and P2: 58.8° for BT-BNMe2 and 32.0° for BT-BNBn2). (2) The boron centers are both perfectly planar with the sum of
the C–B–C bond angles equal to 360°. It was also
noted that the boryl-bonded thienyl ring is more coplanar with the
BC3 plane, as illustrated by much smaller dihedral angles
(22.0° for BT-BNMe2 and
35.3° for BT-BNBn2) than
the two phenyl rings of mesityl groups (48.4°–64.1°).
Consequently, the B–C19 bond length is shorter than B–C1
and B–C10 to some extent, suggesting that the B center is conjugated
with the bithienyl framework more efficiently. On the contrary, the
nitrogen center in BT-BNMe2 exhibits
highly pyramidalized geometry. The sum of the C–N–C
bond angle is around 340°. (3) There possibly exists π–π
interactions between P1 and P3 in BT-BNMe2, as evidenced by the small torsion angle (26.8°) and
short centroid–centroid distance (3.89 Å). Compared with
the biphenyl analogues, some structural differences were also observed.
(1) The nitrogen center of BT-BNBn2 is still highly pyramidalized despite the much released steric
congestion. (2) The main chain of bithienyl derivatives turns more
coplanar compared with the corresponding biphenyl analogues, probably
because of less steric congestion of the bithienyl skeleton (dihedral
angle between two phenyl rings: 70.7° for BP-BNMe2 and 50.0° for BP-BNBn2).

Photophysical Properties
The two
2,2′-bithienyl
derivatives contain both electron-accepting BMes2 and electron-donating
NR2 groups.7 They were expected
to display intramolecular CT transitions, which would lead to great
fluorescence solvatochromism. To eliminate the influence of the solvent
polarity, the photophysical properties were first examined in cyclohexane. Figure 3 shows the UV–vis
absorption and fluorescence spectra, and the corresponding data are
listed in Table 2.

that is, derived following the equation τ = ∑Aiτi2/∑Aiτi, in which Ai is the amplitude of each lifetime.

Regarding the photophysical
properties, the most notable feature
for the biphenyl derivatives is that the fluorescence of NMe2-substituted BP-BNMe2 is significantly
red-shifted than NBn2-substituted BP-BNBn2 (Δλ = 71 nm in cyclohexane), although
their absorption spectra are not very different (Figure 3). From BP-BNBn2 to BT-BNBn2, both the absorption and emission of BT-BNBn2 are significantly red-shifted (Δλ
= 52 nm for absorption and 72 nm for emission), suggesting the remarkable
effect of the parent framework on the photophysical properties. Thus,
the longest absorption band of the BT-BNBn2 is located at 414 nm with a moderate intensity (log
ε = 3.73), and the fluorescence band was observed at 522 nm.
Considering the very similar structural features between biphenyl
and 2,2′-bithienyl derivatives, the fluorescence of NMe2-substituted bithienyl BT-BNMe2 was initially expected to be shifted to about 600 nm, which
is much longer than BT-BNBn2.
It was completely unexpected that the emission spectra of BT-BNMe2 and BT-BNBn2 are almost identical (Δλ = 3 nm), which is a sharp
contrast to about 71 nm red shift from BP-BNBn2 to BP-BNMe2.
As for the absorption, BT-BNMe2 shows absorption maximum at 402 nm (log ε = 3.31), which is
slightly blue-shifted with a lower intensity than BT-BNBn2. It was also noted that the fluorescence
of two 2,2′-bithienyl compounds is not very intense (ΦF = 0.075 for BT-BNMe2 and 0.025 for BT-BNBn2). The
time-resolved fluorescence study revealed that the fluorescence lifetimes
of two 2,2′-bithienyl derivatives are much shorter than the
biphenyl compounds (17.8 ns for BP-BNMe2 and 9.8 ns for BP-BNBn2). On the basis of the radiative and nonradiative decay rate constants,
which are calculated according to the equations F = kr × τ and kr + kr = τ–1, the decrease in the fluorescence
efficiency of the bithienyl system is mainly ascribed to the acceleration
of the nonradiative decay process. The main reason for this is probably
the heavy atom effect of sulfur that facilitates the intersystem crossing.8 Consequently, the change of amino groups from
NMe2 to NBn2 exhibits a trivial effect on the
photophysical properties of triarylborane-based 2,2′-bithienyl
derivatives.

Considering the donor−π–acceptor
structure
and thus possible intramolecular CT characteristics of two bithienyl
derivatives, the absorption and emission spectra were also examined
in solvents with different polarities. The related data are summarized
in Table 3. With the
increased solvent polarity, the fluorescence spectra are red-shifted
obviously in spite of unobvious solvent dependence on absorption.
This fact clearly suggests the more polarized structures in the excited
state than in the ground state, denoting the intramolecular CT characteristics
of the first excited state. It was noted that the fluorescence solvatochromism
of bithienyls is not significant as the biphenyl analogues. From nonpolar
cyclohexane to highly polar MeCN, the fluorescence shifts are only
39 and 17 nm for BT-BNMe2 and BT-BNBn2, respectively. In contrast,
the corresponding shifts of BP-BNMe2 and BP-BNBn2 are 59 and
58 nm, respectively. The polarization degree of the excited state
can be compared in terms of the Lippert–Mataga equation [eq 1],9 in which Δν is the Stokes shift, μe and μg correspond to the excited and ground state
dipole moments,respectively, Δf is the solvent
polarity, and C is a constant. Δf is given by eq 2, where n refers to the optical 1   2  refractive constant and ε refer to the
dielectric constant.10 In fact, the linear
relationships were obtained for the plots of Δν as a function
of Δf for BT-BNMe2 and BT-BNBn2 (Figure 4). From the slope
of two plots, the dipole moment change (μe –
μg) from the ground state to the excited state was
calculated with the assumption of the molecular radius as the cavity
radius. The examined molecules are not spherical in nature. The molecular
radii were estimated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations
and are summarized in Table 3.11 The dipole moment changes from
the ground state to excited state were also calculated and are also
summarized in Table 3. The two bithienyl compounds show distinct dipole moment changes
from the ground state to the excited state, suggesting the intramolecular
CT characteristics of emission. However, the dipole moment changes
are much less significant than the corresponding biphenyls. In addition,
the dipole moment changes are the same for the two bithienyls, which
is different from that the dipole moment change of the NBn2-substituted biphenyl BP-BNBn2 is higher than the NMe2-substituted biphenyl BP-BNMe2 (μe – μg: 14.8 debye for BP-BNMe2 and 17.7 for BP-BNBn2). The
abovementioned results clearly suggest that the simple change of the
parent framework from biphenyl to bithienyl exhibits substantial influence
on the photophysical properties. The bithienyl compounds BT-BNBn2 and BT-BNMe2 modified with different amino groups display photophysical
properties in a complete different trend with the corresponding biphenyl
analogues BP-BNBn2 and BP-BNMe2.

Theoretical Calculations
To further shed light on the
photophysical properties of 2,2′-bithienyl, comprehensive theoretical
calculations were performed by the Gaussian 09 program.11 The geometries of the ground state (S0) were first optimized by DFT calculations using the X-ray crystal
structure as the initial structure. Then, the vertical excitation
energies were calculated via time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations.
A frequency calculation was made following all geometry optimizations
to make sure to get the minimum optimized geometry.

The optimized
structure of S0 reproduces the features that are essentially
in agreement with those of the X-ray crystal structures (Table 1). For example, NR2 and BMes2 groups are located at the same side
of the bithienyl axis in BT-NMe2, while they lay on two opposite sides in BT-NBn2. Moreover, the short centroid–centroid
distance (3.91 Å) and small dihedral angle (25.7°) between
P1 and P3 in BT-NMe2 again suggest
possible π–π interactions between them.

Figure 5 shows the
pictorial drawing, energy levels, and transitions of two bithienyl
compounds. In the S0 state, both the highest occupied molecular
orbitals (HOMOs) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs)
of BT-BNMe2 and BT-BNBn2 can spread over the whole bithienyl skeleton
with great contributions from the amino group and the dimesitylboryl
group, respectively. In BT-BNMe2, the benzene ring P3 also contributes to the HOMO, suggesting the
intramolecular π–π interaction between P1 and P3.
Probably because of the more efficient conjugation of the bithienyl
skeleton in BT-BNBn2 as the result
of higher coplanarity between two thienyl rings, BT-BNBn2 shows higher HOMO and lower LUMO energy
levels compared with BT-BNMe2. The TD-DFT calculations suggest that the first excited states of BT-BNBn2 and BT-BNMe2 are assignable to HOMO → LUMO transitions,
which is a characteristic of intramolecular CT to some extent. Consequently, BT-BNMe2 has a higher vertical excitation
energy with smaller oscillator strength. This is in good agreement
that BT-BNMe2 shows the longest
absorption band at a shorter wavelength with a lower intensity relative
to BT-BNBn2.

levels, pictorial drawing of frontier orbitals,
and transitions of (a) BT-BNMe2 and (b) BT-BNBn2 at different
geometries, calculated at PBE0/6-31g(d).

Compared with the biphenyl derivatives, the most noteworthy
feature
for the 2,2′-bithienyls is that no obvious red shift of fluorescence
was observed for the NMe2-substituted BT-BNMe2 relative to the NBn2-substituted BT-BNBn2. To clarify the effect of
the amino group on the fluorescence property, the optimizations of
the first excited state (S1) geometries were also carried
out.10 With regard to the structure of
the S1 state, the following four points are noted. (1)
The boryl and amino groups are still located on the same side and
opposite sides of the 2,2′-bithienyl axis for BT-BNMe2 and BT-BNBn2, just as in the ground state. (2) The NC3 plane
of BT-BNMe2 becomes almost completely
planar, whereas the N center in BT-BNBn2 still remains highly pyramidalized. Meanwhile, the N–C24
bond turns shorter compared with the ground state, especially for BT-BNMe2. These facts might indicate
the more efficient conjugation between the amino group and 2,2′-bithienyl
skeleton in the excited state. (3) The BC3 plane of BT-BNMe2 turns more coplanar with
P2 in the S1 state along with the shortening of the corresponding
B–C19 bond. On the contrary, the structure of BT-BNBn2 changes in an opposite manner. As a result,
the conjugation between the boron center and 2,2′-bithienyl
skeleton is more efficient in the S1 state for BT-BNMe2, whereas the conjugation between the boron
center and pendent two phenyl rings of mesityl groups are more effective
for BT-BNBn2. (4) The π–π
interaction between P1 and P3 might become stronger, as indicated
by the smaller dihedral angle and shorter centroid–centroid
distance. Along with the stereo structure changes from the ground
state to the excited state, no much great difference was observed
for the electron distribution of frontier orbitals. The energy levels
of HOMOs and LUMOs are elevated and lowered, respectively. Notably,
the HOMO energy levels of BT-BNMe2 and BT-BNBn2 are almost the
same and the LUMO energy level of BT-BNBn2 is even a little lower than BT-BNMe2. Thus, BT-BNMe2 has a slightly higher HOMO–LUMO gap than BT-BNBn2 (0.08 eV difference). Considering the similar
HOMO–LUMO gap for the 2,2′-bithienyl molecules, it is
reasonable that they emit fluorescence at very close wavelengths.

To shed light on the solvent effect on the fluorescence, the dipole
moments at the optimized S0 and S1 geometries
and at the Frank-Cotton geometries for absorption and emission were
also calculated and are summarized in Table 4. The dipole moment is increased from the
ground state to the excited state for both the 2,2′-bithienyl
compounds. However, the increase extent is less significant than the
biphenyl derivatives. In addition, dipole moment changes of the two
2,2′-bithienyls are almost the same, which is very different
from those of the NBn2-substituted biphenyl BP-BNBn2, which exhibits greater dipole moment changes
than the NMe2-substituted biphenyl BP-BNMe2. The similar dipole moment changes of 2,2′-bithienyls
are well consistent with the experimental results obtained from the
fluorescence solvatochromism. Therefore, the above mentioned calculated
results reasonably support the experimental results that both 2,2′-bithienyls
emit fluorescence at very close wavelength, and their fluorescence
solvatochromism is not very significant. Thus, for the triarylborane-based
3,3′-subsituted 2,2′-bithienyls, the change of the amino
group with different steric effects is not effective to tune the fluorescence
wavelength.

Conclusions
In summary, we have prepared two new triarylborane-based
o,o′-substituted
2,2′-bithienyls, BT-BNMe2 and BT-BNBn2, in which BMes2 and NMe2/NBn2 groups are introduced
at 3,3′-positions of the 2,2′-bithienyl framework. Their
X-ray single-crystal structures, UV-absorption, and fluorescence properties
were fully characterized to elucidate the effect of the parent framework
change from biphenyl to bithienyl on the photophysical properties.
Similar to the previously reported o,o′-substituted biphenyl
analogues, BP-BNMe2 and BP-BNBn2, the steric effect of the
amino group has significant influence on the conformation of the 2,2′-bithienyl
skeleton. The boryl and amino groups are located at the same side
of the 2,2′-bithienyls axis with a short B···N
distance (3.63 Å) for the NMe2-substituted BT-BNMe2. On the contrary, the two substituents
are arranged on the two opposite sides of the 2,2′-bithienyls
axis for the NBn2-substituted BT-NBn2. Despite the remarkable differences in the steric structure, the
two 2,2′-bithienyls display fluorescence at the close wavelengths,
which is in sharp contrast to the much red-shifted fluorescence of BP-BNMe2 than BP-BNBn2. The theoretical calculations demonstrated
that the two 2,2′-bithienyls have close energy levels for the
frontier orbitals and thus similar HOMO–LUMO gaps, which firmly
support the experimental results. Thus, for the triarylborane-based
3,3′-substituted 2,2′-bithienyls, the change of the
amino group with different steric effects is not effective to tune
the fluorescence wavelength. The parent main chain framework can exhibit
a great impact on the charge-transfer emission of o,o′-substituted
biaryls. Our current systematic results about triarylborane-based
o,o′-substituted biaryls are believed to be a very useful basis
for the fine-tuning of emission wavelength.
