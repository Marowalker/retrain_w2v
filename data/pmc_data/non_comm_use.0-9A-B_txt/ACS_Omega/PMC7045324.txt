Biosorption
is an alternative procedure to remove metal ions from
aqueous media using agricultural waste. In this work, the adsorption
capacity and removal efficiency of agave bagasse (AB) toward Pb(II),
Cd(II), and Zn(II) were analyzed. Parameters such as equilibrium pH,
particle size, AB dosage, time, and initial metal ion concentration
were discussed. The results showed that pH 5.5, 0.4 g (<250 μm),
and only 15 min of contact assured conditions for maximum adsorption
capacity. The kinetic studies were fitted to the pseudo-second-order
model, whereas the isotherms showed good agreement with the Langmuir
model. AB has a higher affinity for Pb(II) over Cd(II) and Zn(II),
and the maximum adsorption capacities were 93.14, 28.50, and 24.66
mg g–1, respectively. The results of the characterization
evidenced two adsorption mechanisms. Scanning electron microscopy
and X-ray diffraction displayed adsorption via the ion exchange mechanism
by releasing Ca(II). The 13C cross-polarization mode with
magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance analysis demonstrated
a complexation mechanism by cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin groups
with Pb(II) and Cd(II), whereas the complexation is mainly observed
by cellulose groups for Zn(II). AB is a good alternative for the removal
of metals without prior thermal or chemical treatment, with rapid
kinetics, suitable adsorption capacity, and high removal efficiency
contributing to waste management.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Water pollution has been
increasing because of population growth,
anthropogenic activities, urbanization, industrialization, and excessive
use of water. The treatment of industrial effluents or wastewater
is complex due to the variety of pollutants such as the heavy metals,
Pb, Cd, Zn, Cr, Hg, and Ni in different oxidation states, besides
other organic compounds that are commonly used in the stages of the
productive processes. The heavy metals cause several health problems
in humans, animals, and plants, and their elimination is imperative.
Several methods for their removal have been proposed, such as chemical
precipitation, ion exchange, membrane filtration, and adsorption.1−3 Nevertheless, adsorption has advantages over other methods in terms
of effectiveness and feasible regeneration.4 Different sorbents have been developed and evaluated for the removal
of heavy metals, including minerals such as aluminosilicates or vermiculites
and activated carbon.5 The latter has limited
use because of its high cost.

Other kinds of sorbents with a
relatively recent application are
the residues from food or agriculture industries. These wastes are
considered as biosorbents,6,7 and so far, studies
show that longer adsorption times8−10 and preliminary chemical
treatments are required,3,11−13 which undoubtedly affect their further application. Notwithstanding,
the feasibility of the adsorption process has been reported in a continuous
system besides at a pilot scale.14,15

In Mexico,
thousands of tons of agave bagasse (AB) are discarded
annually due to the high production of tequila spirit or mezcal, and
it is close to 40% of the total processed agave.16 AB is a porous material mainly composed of cellulose, hemicellulose,
and lignin.17 It has been proposed for
different applications such as animal feed18 or reinforcement for composite materials.19 Because of its active sites, AB is capable to adsorb heavy metals.12,20 However, the adsorption kinetics and isotherms in a wide range of
concentration as well as the role of AB compounds (cellulose, hemicellulose,
and lignin) in the adsorption of metal ions have not been evaluated.

The present research is focused on the behavior of AB as a biosorbent
for the heavy metals Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II), evaluating different
parameters in the system such as pH, particle size, biosorbent dosage,
time, and metal ion concentration. The adsorption capacity of the
metal ions from single and binary mixtures was discussed. In addition,
the characterization of AB before and after the adsorption process
was performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction
(XRD), and solid-state 13C cross-polarization mode with
magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (CP/MAS NMR) to evidence
the influence of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin in metal ion
adsorption.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effect
of pH
In Figure 1, the adsorption capacities
and removal efficiencies are presented, which were calculated using
the equations described in the Experimental Section. It is possible to see in Figure 1a that the adsorption capacity (qM(II)) increases with equilibrium pH and reaches a maximum
around pH 5.5. After this, it remained without significant changes
for all metal ions. In Figure 1a, it is notable that AB has more affinity for Pb(II) than
Cd(II) and Zn(II). For instance, at pH 5.5, qPb(II) was 11.28 mg g–1, whereas Cd(II) and
Zn(II) exhibited similar behavior, obtaining 4.06 and 4.15 mg g–1, respectively. The removal efficiency showed the
same trend as that of the adsorption capacity (Figure 1b). At pH 5.5, 96.8% Pb(II), 41% Cd(II),
and 40% Zn(II) were removed.

Figure 1 Influence of pH on (a) adsorption capacity of
AB and (b) removal
efficiency. C0 = 100 mg L–1, wAB = 0.4 g (>250 μm), and t = 30 min.

These results can be
explained by the biosorbent surface charge
as it is affected by pH. The point of zero charge (pHPZC) of AB was evaluated, and the result is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Point of zero charge
for AB.

pHPZC of 4.7 indicates
that at pH < 4.7, the ΔpH
values (and the biosorbent surface) are positive, whereas at pH >
4.7, the surface is negative. pHPZC is indicated by the
vertical dashed line in Figures 1a and 2.

Cellulose, hemicellulose,
and lignin are the main compounds of
AB, and they contain functional groups such as hydroxyl −OH
and carboxyl −COOH. The pKa value for the hydroxyl group is
in the range of 9.5–13.21 Therefore,
the negative charges found on the biosorbent surface between 4.7 and
this range (9.5–13) of pH should be predominantly because of
the carboxylate groups, whereas those below should be because of the
phenolate groups. As the present study involves metal ions, the regions
more basic than pH 7–8 was avoided, aiming to minimize the
formation of metallic hydroxocomplexes and other related complexes.
Therefore, the phenolate groups do not contribute to the surface charge
in the pH region studied in the paper.

The carboxylic groups
must be deprotonated to generate negative
charges on the surface and H+ in aqueous media and permit
the adsorption of different metal ions. This is carried out from pH
1.7 (pKa: 1.7–4.721), thus promoting a rise in the metal ion adsorption by
a complexation mechanism that explains the moderate adsorption capacities
at pH < pHPZC.

The results are in agreement with
the pH range reported for cucumber
peel,22,23 rapeseed biomass, and bamboo, presenting
the higher adsorption capacity at pH between 5 and 6.

2.2 Effect of Particle Size
Figure 3 shows the variation
of qM(II) as a function of particle size.
It can be observed that the adsorption capacity increases when the
particle size range diminishes from >250 to 250–180 μm
for Cd(II) and Zn(II). This is related to the milling process that
exposes the active sites in AB inducing more contact area during the
adsorption experiments. However, a greater reduction in particle size
does not represent a higher adsorption capacity, obtaining 9.6 and
9.2 mg g–1 for Cd(II) and Zn(II), respectively.
For Pb(II), the adsorption capacity remains constant at 10.9 mg g–1 for all the particle size ranges analyzed. It means
that the adsorption of Pb(II) is independent of this parameter.

Figure 3 Adsorption
capacity of AB as a function of particle size range. C0 = 100 mg L–1, wAB = 0.4 g, t = 30 min, and pH = 5.5.

The removal efficiencies are presented in Table 1. Particle sizes <250
μm exhibited
a very good performance, removing around 99% of Pb(II), 91% of Cd(II),
and 80% of Zn(II). The results show that with smaller particle size,
the contact area increases, improving adsorption, unlike the results
shown in Figure 1 where
only 41 and 40% were reached for Cd (II) and Zn (II), respectively.
Therefore, particle sizes lower than 250 μm were selected for
further experiments to assure better conditions for the metal ion
adsorption capacity.

2.3 Influence of Dosage AB
The adsorption
capacity and removal efficiency as a function of AB dosage are displayed
in Figure 4 for Pb(II),
Cd(II), and Zn(II). The results indicate that the adsorption capacity
increases significantly at lower AB amounts. qM(II) reaches 42.6, 27.27, and 24.2 mg g–1 for Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II), respectively, with 0.1 g of AB (Figure 4a). The lower adsorption
capacity and little difference for the three metal ions are observed
with 0.6 g AB. The diminution in adsorption capacity is attributed
to the increase of active sites when the AB mass is augmented, and
then a higher concentration of metal ions is required to allow the
saturation of the biosorbent.

Figure 4 Effect of AB dosage on (a) adsorption capacity
and (b) removal
efficiency. C0 = 100 mg L–1, t = 30 min, pH = 5.5, and AB particle size <250
μm.

In Figure 4b, the
difference in removal efficiency is distinguished when the AB dosage
is modified. For Cd(II) and Zn(II), the removal efficiency increases
with the AB mass. Cd(II) showed better results from 0.3 g with approximately
95%, whereas Zn(II) required 0.4 g of AB to reach 83%. For Pb(II),
it can be observed that the removal efficiency is very similar around
99.4% for all amounts of AB. These results demonstrate the high adsorption
capacities of AB and the preference for Pb(II) compared to Cd(II)
and Zn(II).

Based on the above results, the amount of 0.4 g
of AB was selected
as the best condition for the removal efficiency with acceptable adsorption
capacities for all metal ions, and it was kept constant for kinetic
studies and isotherms.

2.4 Adsorption Kinetics
Figure 5a shows the
adsorption capacity
of Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II) onto AB as a function of time.

Figure 5 (a) Effect
of time on the adsorption capacity of AB. (b) Pseudo-second-order
kinetic model according to eq 4. C0 = 100 mg L–1, wAB = 0.4 g (<250 μm), and
pH = 5.5.

The plot displays that qM(II) for all
metal ions remained constant from the first 5 min of contact with
AB. The adsorption capacities are 11.11 ± 0.22, 10.04 ±
0.20, and 9.60 ± 0.17 mg g –1 corresponding
to Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II). The removal efficiencies calculated
from Figure 5a are
99, 93, and 82% for Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II), respectively, in only
5 min. Then, the adsorption of metal ions onto AB rapidly proceeded
with high removal efficiencies.

In general, the biosorbents
have been identified as materials that
need long times of contact to reach the adsorption equilibrium with
moderate efficiency. For example, Taro (Colocasiaesculenta (L.) Schott) adsorbs Pb(II) in 120
min,24Posidonia oceanica fibers uptake Pb, Cd, and Zn in 80 min,25 whereas 60 min is necessary with cucumber peel for Pb(II) and Cd(II).22,23 Therefore, the results found in this work demonstrate that AB reaches
the adsorption equilibrium in a very short time as compared to other
biosorbents. The following experiments were set up at 15 min to assure
the equilibrium at different conditions.

Adsorption kinetics
for metal ions onto AB have not been previously
reported; the experimental results were fitted to pseudo-first- and
pseudo-second-order models. The pseudo-first-order or Lagergren equation26 is expressed by 1  where qt and qe are the adsorption capacity
at time t and at equilibrium (mg g–1), respectively, and k1 is the pseudo-first-order
rate constant. According to eq 1, the plot of ln(qe – qt) against t gives a straight line, where the slope matches with k1.

The linear form of the pseudo-second-order kinetic
model is26 2  where k2 is the
pseudo-second-order rate constant, and it is obtained from the plot t qt–1 against t.

The accuracy of models was verified by the standard
error (SE)
and was computed by the following equation27 3  where qexp and qcalc represent the experimental and predicted
adsorption capacity by the model, respectively, and N is the number of experiments.

According to eq 1,
an acceptable fitting to experimental data is not observed (correlation
coefficient, R2 < 0.93) unlike that
of the pseudo-second-order equation. Figure 5b presents the fitting according to eq 2. The adsorption of metal
ions is described by the pseudo-second-order model with remarkable
agreement to the correlation coefficient (R2) higher than 0.99.

The results of adsorption kinetics from
both models are resumed
in Table 2. The k2 values for Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II) were
1.0602, 1.2910, and 0.8969 g mg–1 min–1, respectively. The SEs for the three metal ions were lower than
0.05, which corroborates a very good agreement between the experimental
and predicted values of adsorption capacity. The solid lines in Figure 5a correspond to the
predicted adsorption capacity based on the obtained parameters of
the pseudo-second-order model. This model is representative of the
adsorption behavior of divalent metal ions such as Pb(II), Cd(II),
and Zn(II).28

2.5 Adsorption Isotherms
Figure 6a presents
the adsorption isotherms
for each metal ion in an interval of the initial concentration of
10–1000 mg L–1. At low concentrations, it
is notable that qM(II) increases with
the equilibrium concentration. In this case, the mass-transfer resistance
between solid and liquid phases is diminished through driving force
by concentration effect enhancing adsorption capacity.29 However, at higher concentrations, the adsorption
capacity achieves a plateau that matches with the maximum adsorption
capacity (qmax,exp), as the active sites
are occupied, inducing the biosorbent saturation. For Pb(II), qmax,exp was 93.14 ± 3.38 mg g–1 at 560 mg L–1 as the equilibrium concentration.
However, when the concentration is higher, it is observed that the
adsorption capacity is lower than the maximum adsorption capacity
(indicated with an arrow in Figure 6a). This phenomenon is attributed to the high amount
of Pb(II) on the surface promoting the desorption of metal ions from
the saturated active sites.30 In the case
of Cd(II) and Zn(II), the adsorption behavior is similar, and the
plateau is rapidly achieved at 28.50 ± 3.72 and 24.66 ±
2.97 mg g –1, respectively. An extended comparison
with other references is presented in Table 3, and it is noticed that the majority of
biosorbents do not have the high adsorption capacity exhibited by
AB in this work in a very short time. Comparable results have been
reported using mango or cucumber peel after 60 min.22,23,31,32 In this work,
the experiments only required 15 min for similar adsorption capacities.
The results reported by other authors for AB without treatment indicate
that the adsorption capacity for Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II) are 35.6,
13.27, and 7.84 mg g–1, respectively.12 These values are lower than those obtained in
this work owing to different experimental conditions used by the authors,
such as narrow concentration interval, higher particle size, and lower
pH.

The Langmuir and Freundlich equations were considered to represent
the experimental systems in terms of equilibrium concentration, Ce, and adsorption capacity, qe.35,36 The first one in linear form
is defined by 4  where qmax is
the saturated monolayer adsorption capacity and KL is the Langmuir constant. According to eq 4, the plot of Ce·qe–1 against Ce gives a straight line whose
slope is equivalent to qmax–1, and from the intercept, it is possible to calculate the KL value.

Freundlich isotherm describes
heterogeneous systems by the following
equation 5  where n is the adsorption
intensity and KF is the Freundlich isotherm
constant. The logarithmic graph of qe versus Ce gives a straight line, where the slope is
related to n–1 value and the intercept
corresponds to log KF. The experimental
data were analyzed considering both models.

The results of the
fitted data such as slope, intercept of the
straight line, correlation coefficient, and the obtained parameters
of eqs 4 and 5 are given in Table 4.

In Figure 6b, it
is possible to see that the experimental data for Pb(II), Cd(II),
and Zn(II) have a very good agreement with the Langmuir model (eq 4). The correlation coefficient
is higher than 0.99, which indicates that this model is suitable to
predict the adsorption capacity of AB for the three metal ions. The
Langmuir constant for Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II) is 0.0748, 0.0695,
and 0.0432 L mg–1, respectively. Then, the adsorption
onto AB is brought out by the monolayer formation to reach the saturation
of the biosorbent, and this is associated with a complex mechanism.37 Despite the higher constant obtained for Pb(II),
SE is also elevated. This is attributed to the wide concentration
interval evaluated. At higher concentrations, the adsorbed Pb(II)
onto AB raises and significant interactions take place. Thus, deviations
from the Langmuir model were observed, increasing the SE.

With
regard to the calculated parameters for the Freundlich model
(Table 4), the correlation
coefficients do not exceed the value of 0.95, indicating an acceptable
fitting. A high n value suggests a stronger interaction
of the biosorbent with the heavy metal.38 In this context, Pb(II) results in an n value equal
to 1.90, which is higher for Cd(II) and Zn(II), that is, 2.79 and
2.60, respectively. This shows the stronger interaction of AB with
Cd(II) and Zn(II) than that with Pb(II) in contrast to the experimental
results. It is associated with the low correlation coefficient that
implies differences between the experimental data and the model.

Although the experimental data satisfactorily fitted with both
models, for the Freundlich model, the correlation coefficients are
lower than that of the Langmuir equation (Table 4), and the main deviations are for the higher
concentrations. AB is not a homogeneous biosorbent, but the adsorption
data fitted well to the Langmuir model, and it is related to the small
particle size used in the adsorption experiments. In consequence,
the active sites of AB are available homogeneously to adsorb metal
ions.

2.6 Adsorption Behavior in Binary Mixtures
The results discussed above correspond to the adsorption behavior
of Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II) onto AB from single solutions without
considering the interaction with other ions.

Figure 7 includes the adsorption capacities
of Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II) in binary mixtures and their comparison
with single solutions. The adsorption capacity of Pb(II) is improved
in the presence of Cd(II) from 10.5 to 13.41 mg g–1, whereas the obtained adsorption capacity is 8.28 mg g–1 for the mixture Pb(II) + Zn(II) (Figure 7a). In contrast, slight changes are observed
in the adsorption capacity of Cd(II) when Pb(II) or Zn(II) is included
in the solution (Figure 7b). In the case of Zn(II), a diminution in adsorption capacity is
remarkable when Pb(II) or Cd(II) is present (Figure 7c).

Figure 7 Comparison of the adsorption capacities of (a)
Pb(II), (b) Cd(II),
and (c) Zn(II) onto AB from single and binary mixtures. C0 = 100 mg L–1, wAB = 0.4 g (<250 μm), t = 15 min,
and pH = 5.5.

The competition effect in the
adsorption capacity in binary mixtures
was calculated by the following relationship 6  where qem and qe0 are the adsorption
capacities of the metal ion in a mixture (superscript m = Pb + Cd,
Pb + Zn, or Zn + Cd) and single solution (superscript 0), respectively.39 Thus, when r is higher than
unity, the adsorption of the metal ion improves in the mixture or
a synergistic effect is observed. In contrast, a value smaller than
1 implies a diminished adsorption capacity or an antagonistic effect
of metal ions, and finally r equal to 1 indicates
that there is no interaction between two metal ions. The calculated
values of r using eq 6 are condensed in Table 5.

Table 5 Relationship between the Adsorption
Capacities from Single and Binary Solutions According to eq 6a
metal ion	qePb+Cd/qe0	qePb+Zn/qe0	qeCd+Zn/qe0	
Pb(II)	1.19	0.74	 	
Cd(II)	1.07	 	1.05	
Zn(II)	 	0.63	0.75	
a C0 =
100 mg L–1, wAB = 0.4
g (<250 μm), t = 15 min, pH = 5.5.

According to that described above,
the synergistic effect is found
for Pb(II) in the presence of Cd(II), obtaining a ratio of 1.19, whereas
in the presence of Zn(II), it diminished considerably (r = 0.74). There is no significant competence for the active sites
on AB by the other ions over Cd(II) as r is very
close to 1. In the case of Zn(II), the presence of Pb(II) or Cd(II)
induces an antagonistic effect, obtaining an r value
of 0.63 and 0.75, respectively. It is reported in the literature40 that the hydrated ion radius of Pb (401 pm)
which is smaller than that of Cd and Zn (426 and 430 pm, respectively),
along with its higher covalent-bonding character, promotes a highly
favorable interaction with ligands such as the carboxyl groups of
AB, inhibiting the adsorption of other metal ions. This explains the
diminution in the adsorption capacity of Zn(II). Similar effects have
been found in the adsorption of Pb and Ni mixtures onto coconut shell
and water hyacinth28 or Pb and Cd mixtures
onto cucumber peel.23

2.7 Characterization of Biosorbent and Adsorption
Mechanisms
2.7.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy
Figure 8 shows the scanning
electron micrographs for AB and the biosorbent after metal ion adsorption
at a maximum adsorption capacity. The AB particles shown in Figure 8a present several
ducts in the transversal section, whereas the longitudinal section
has a rough surface which promotes a large area of contact to perform
the adsorption process. The morphology of AB after the adsorption
process is not modified (Figure 8c,e,g). A SEM/energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS)
analysis was carried out in the samples. For AB, the presence of calcium
besides carbon and oxygen is notable (Figure 8b). The peaks of copper are due to the metallization
treatment of the samples to make them conductive on the surface.

Figure 8 Micrographs
and SEM/EDS of (a,b) AB, (c,d) AB–Pb, (e,f)
AB–Cd, and (g,h) AB–Zn at maximum adsorption capacity.

The calcium percent in AB corresponds to 2.3 wt
%, whereas after
the adsorption process, values of 0.77, 0.94, and 0.86 wt % were obtained
for AB–Pb, AB–Cd, and AB–Zn, respectively (Figure 8d,f,h). The variation
in the calcium percent indicates an ionic exchange mechanism in which
calcium is exchanged by the metal ions during the adsorption process.
The SEM/EDS mapping of micrographs are included in Figure 9 for AB–Pb, AB–Cd,
and AB–Zn. The different elements in the samples were identified
by color: carbon, red; oxygen, green; calcium, cyan; and Pb, Cd, or
Zn in blue. It is observed that heavy metals are homogeneously distributed
in AB, confirming the adsorption of metal ions onto AB, as predicted
by the Langmuir model.

2.7.2 X-ray
Diffraction
Figure 10 exhibits the XRD patterns
of AB and those acquired after the adsorption process at maximum capacity.
The peaks observed in the AB patterns at 14.7, 15, and 20° are
associated with cellulose.41 The lignocellulosic
component gives a peak at 24.14°,42 whereas peaks at 29.88, 37.97, and 45.63° were indexed to calcium
oxalate monohydrate or whewellite, CaC2O4·H2O (COD 9000763). Similar results were reported by other authors.43 No peaks were related to lignin because it is
an amorphous macromolecule.

Figure 10 XRD patterns for AB, AB–Pb, AB–Cd,
and AB–Zn
at maximum adsorption capacity.

The difference between the XRD patterns of AB and those after the
adsorption of metal ions, AB–Pb, AB–Cd, and AB–Zn,
is notable. The pattern of AB–Pb displays a lower intensity
of peaks associated with cellulose in comparison with those of AB–Cd
and AB–Zn. The metal ions adsorbed on AB induce a variation
in the cellulose structure by linking through functional groups, which
reflect a change in the peak intensity. The van der Waals halo (broad
peak at 15–20°) is also modified. This is attributed to
the presence of metal ions on the polymeric structure, reducing the
interaction by van der Waals forces, as is mainly observed for Pb(II).
The foregoing results confirm that adsorption is carried out by a
complexation mechanism through the cellulose groups. Nevertheless,
the effect of other compounds such as hemicellulose or lignin on AB
must be analyzed by another technique.

With reference to CaC2O4·H2O, all peaks show a decrease
in intensity because of the cationic
exchange of Ca(II), as has been proven by SEM/EDS (Figure 8). This effect indicates that
Cd(II) and Zn(II) are mainly adsorbed onto AB by a cationic exchange
mechanism. For Pb(II), the adsorption mechanism is also associated
to complexation with the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of cellulose.
From the XRD analysis, it is possible to explain that AB has more
affinity for Pb(II) because its adsorption is performed by two mechanisms,
whereas the Cd(II) and Zn(II) adsorption depends mostly on calcium
exchange. It was reported that the adsorption of heavy metals onto
sugar beet pulp was brought out by complexation and cationic exchange
mechanism.44

2.7.3 Solid-State 13C CP/MAS NMR
In order to elucidate the role of AB
compounds in the complexation
mechanism during the adsorption, further characterization by solid-state 13C CP/MAS NMR was performed. Figure 11 shows the obtained spectrum of AB. The
peaks were identified at the carbon atoms of cellulose, lignin, and
hemicellulose with the initials C, L, and H, respectively.

Figure 11 Solid-state 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra for AB, AB−Pb,
AB−Cd, and AB−Zn at maximum adsorption capacity.

In the case of cellulose, the peak at 104.4 ppm
is related to C1
according to the structure in Figure 11. The signal at 73.5 ppm is attributed to C2 and C3,
whereas C5 gives a peak at 71.8 ppm.45 Unlike
XRD, NMR is useful to differentiate the crystalline and amorphous
cellulose in AB.46 Thus, peaks at 88.2
and 64.3 ppm are designed for C4 and C6 of ordered cellulose and linked
by hydrogen bonds (crystalline),41 as identified
by XRD (Figure 10).
Signals at 82.4 and 62.1 ppm correspond to C4′ and C6′
in amorphous cellulose (indicated by quotation marks).41,45,47

The hemicellulose gives
signals at 104.6, 78.3, 77.0, 75.6, 74.1,
65.7, and 62.1 ppm.44 At these chemical
shifts are observed only the cellulose peaks that overlap with those
of hemicellulose because of their similar structure. In addition,
the spectrum shows peaks at 173.3 and 20.6 ppm that are characteristic
of −COOH and −CH3 in the acetyl groups of
hemicellulose.47

The region between
120 and 160 ppm is reported as characteristic
of carbon in the aromatic ring of lignin. At 153.3 and 150.8 ppm are
displayed the peaks for L3 and L5, whereas the signal of the chemical
shift at 121.5 ppm corresponds to L4. The methoxy groups −OCH3 are identified by the peak at 55.3 ppm.47−49 The α,
β, and γ carbons in lignin must give signals in the region
60–90 ppm,49 which clearly are overlapped
by the cellulose peaks. CH3 in the acetyl groups in lignin
can be assigned also at 20.6 ppm beside hemicellulose, whereas 24.9–32.3
ppm is designated to the α and β carbons in the methylene
groups.41 Finally, the carboxyl groups
in lignin give a signal in 167.6–168.3 ppm.

In Figure 11 are
also shown the spectra for AB–Pb, AB–Cd, and AB–Zn
at maximum adsorption capacity conditions. For better comparison,
the AB spectrum was included as a dashed line. After metal ion adsorption,
several cellulose peaks in the spectra are shifted to a lower field
mainly for C2,3 bonded to the −OH group and C4′. This
observation confirms that the metal ion adsorption is performed by
the complexation with cellulose by H+ exchange of the hydroxyl
group. The modification of the chemical structure of cellulose is
perceptible as a split peak assigned to C2,3, mostly evident to Pb(II)
and Zn(II) corresponding to the cellulose-free and to the cellulose-linked
metal ion. Thus, a lower intensity in this peak is notable. With respect
to C4 and C4′, the spectrum AB–Pb does not show any
modification in these signals. However, the AB–Cd spectrum
presents a change in C4′, whereas AB–Zn is modified
in both C4 and C4′. This indicates that only Cd(II) and Zn(II)
have interaction with C4 in cellulose, and Cd(II) has a preference
by the crystalline over amorphous cellulose. In contrast, Pb(II) and
Cd(II) adsorption modified the structure of cellulose in C6 and C6′
unlike Zn(II). The observed changes in the spectra indicate that the
polymeric structure of cellulose is altered, reducing their crystallinity.
This observation agrees with the results obtained by XRD where a decrease
in van der Waals halo is noted.

On the other hand, it is remarkable
that a shoulder appears around
101 ppm related to C1 of hemicellulose.47 In this case, the chemical environment of cellulose was modified
with the metal ion adsorption showing the signal of hemicellulose.
Novel peaks are observed after Pb(II) and Cd(II) adsorption at 175.9
and 175.1 ppm, respectively. These peaks are attributed to the −COO–M(II)
group bonded to the metal ion in hemicellulose, whereas the peak around
173 ppm represents the −COOH groups.

The spectra show
evident changes in L4, methoxyl, and carboxyl
groups, which are associated with the complexation of metal ions.
For Pb(II) and Zn(II), a novel peak was found that can be assigned
to the α carbon in lignin.41Table 6 presents the assignment
of spectra.

The solid-state 13C CP/MAS NMR
spectra provide important
evidence to the complexation mechanism for the metal ion adsorption
onto AB. Then, Pb(II) is adsorbed by the cellulose, hemicellulose,
and lignin groups. This explains the high affinity of AB for Pb(II).
For the adsorption of Cd(II), the three compounds of AB participate
in the adsorption process in a lesser grade than Pb(II). Zn(II) is
adsorbed by the amorphous cellulose with a scarce contribution by
the hemicellulose and lignin groups, which is in agreement with the
low adsorption capacity of AB.

3 Conclusions
The adsorption behavior of AB has been investigated to remove Pb(II),
Cd(II), and Zn(II), and the results proved AB to be a potent biosorbent.
The adsorption capacity is highly influenced by pH, particle size,
dosage, time, and metal ion concentration. The kinetic studies demonstrated
that adsorption rapidly proceeds with high removal efficiencies, that
is, 99, 93, and 82% for Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II), respectively,
in only 5 min and follows the pseudo-second-order equation. The isotherms
show a Langmuir behavior with the maximum adsorption capacity of 93.14,
28.50, and 24.66 mg g–1 in the case of Pb(II), Cd(II),
and Zn(II), respectively. In binary mixtures, the presence of other
ions affect the adsorption capacity of Cd(II) and Zn(II). Finally,
better affinity for Pb(II) over Cd(II) and Zn(II) was evidenced from
characterization by SEM/EDS and XRD. The results reveal a combined
adsorption mechanism by complexation with cellulose functional groups
and calcium exchange for Pb(II); meanwhile, Cd(II) and Zn(II) are
mainly adsorbed onto AB by ionic exchange.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
The reagents used in this
study were of analytical grade, without further purification. The
aqueous solutions of metal ions were prepared by dissolving appropriate
amounts of Pb(NO3)2, Cd(NO3)2, and ZnSO4 (J.T. Baker, US) in distilled water
to obtain the desired concentration. The solutions were kept at ambient
temperature in polyethylene flask until their utilization.

AB
was obtained from the State of Jalisco (Mexico) as a residue of tequila
spirit production. The content of cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose
in the same AB was reported elsewhere50 and corresponds to 42 ± 2, 15 ± 1, and 20 ± 1%, respectively.
AB was dried in a furnace at 80 °C for 2 h to remove the moisture
and to avoid further degradation. Prior to adsorption experiments,
the organic compounds were removed according to the standard test
method D-1103-9651 to avoid secondary reactions
with metal ions. Then, AB was dried, milled, and sieved in a vibratory
sieve shaker Retsch AS-200 (Germany) for 5 min to select the particle
size.

4.2 Adsorption Behavior
A batch system
was performed thrice with 0.4 ± 0.01 g of AB and 45 mL of a solution
containing metal ions separately in 100 mg L–1 with
magnetic stirring of 300 rpm at 25 °C for 30 min. The pH influence
on adsorption capacity was studied in the range of 3–6.5. The
pH was measured during all the experiments using an HI2550 equipment
(Hanna Instruments, Germany) with a combined electrode, and it was
adjusted by the addition of 0.1 mol L–1 NaOH or
0.1 mol L–1 HCl, as required. Four particle size
ranges were used: >250, 250–180, 180–150, and <150
μm. Experiments were conducted at different AB dosages in a
range of 0.1–0.6 g (<250 μm) at pH 5.5.

For
kinetic studies, the adsorption of each metal ion was performed between
5 and 120 min, at pH 5.5, and with 0.4 g of AB (<250 μm).
The pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order models were discussed for
experimental data.

The adsorption isotherm for each metal ion
in a wide interval of
concentration was obtained using 0.4 g AB, for 15 min, and at pH 5.5.
For these experiments, solutions at different initial concentrations
from 10 to 1000 mg L–1 were used. Langmuir and Freundlich
equations were considered to predict the adsorption behavior.

The influence of metal ions on adsorption from binary mixtures
was studied using 100 mg L–1 for [Pb(II)–Cd(II),
Pb(II)–Zn(II), and Zn(II)–Cd(II)], maintaining the pH
at 5.5, using 0.4 g of biosorbent (<250 μm), and holding
for 15 min.

After all adsorption experiments, AB was separated,
dried for 2
h in a furnace, and reserved for further characterization. The initial
and final concentrations of metal ions were quantified using a 3100
(PerkinElmer, USA) atomic absorption spectrometer.

In adsorption
systems, the adsorption capacity (qM(II), mg g–1) and the removal efficiency
for metal ions [M(II) = Pb(II), Cd(II), or Zn(II)] were calculated
at different conditions by eqs 7 and 8, respectively 7   8  where, V0 and Vf are the initial and final volumes, in liters. C0 and Cf are the
initial and final concentrations of metal ions M(II) expressed in
mg L–1, whereas wAB is
the AB dosage in grams.

4.3 Characterization of Biosorbent
The
solid addition method was used to determine the point of zero charge
(pHPZC) of AB.52 Several 0.1
mol/L KNO3 solutions were adjusted at pH values between
2 and 8 by adding 0.1 HNO3 or NaOH. Each solution with
0.1 g of AB was placed in a sealed flask under constant stirring (150
rpm). After 48 h, the final pH was measured. The plot of ΔpH
(pHf – pH0) against the initial pH (pH0) was made to obtain pHPZC.

AB characterization
was carried out before and after the adsorption experiments by SEM,
XRD, and solid-state 13C CP/MAS NMR. The morphology of
the biosorbent was evaluated by using a scanning electron microscope,
JEOL JSM-6400 (US). EDS microanalysis was conducted to identify the
elements in AB. The samples were weighed (0.2 g) and characterized
with an X-ray diffractometer, Bruker D8 Advance Da Vinci (USA), using
Cu Kα radiation at a step size of 0.03°. Nuclear magnetic
resonance analysis was performed using CP/MAS for 13C nuclei
in a 500 MHz spectrometer (Bruker, USA).
