Catalytic activity, electronic structure,
and the mechanistic aspects
of Co3O4 nanorod (NR) surfaces have been explored
for CO oxidation in dry and wet atmosphere using near-ambient pressure
ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Presence of water with CO
+ O2 plummets the catalytic activity because of the change
in the electronic nature from predominantly oxide (without water in
feed) to a Co3O4 surface covered by a few intermediates.
However, at ≥375 K, the Co3O4 surface
recovers and regains the oxidation activity, at least partially, even
in the presence of water. This is fully supported by the changes observed
in the work function of Co3O4 under wet (H2O + CO + O2) conditions compared with dry (CO +
O2) conditions. This study focuses on the comparative CO
oxidation rate on Co3O4 NR surfaces and highlights
the changes in the electronic structure that occur in the catalyst
during the CO oxidation reaction.

Introduction
Developing a sustainable
CO oxidation catalyst that works at ambient
temperatures under relevant environmental conditions is an important
challenge; indeed it is essential to improve the quality of life of
the current and future generations.1,2 Various noble
metal-based catalysts have been used for CO oxidation
to lower the automotive emissions;1,3 however, owing
to their high cost, sustainability issues, and active temperature
regime limitations, the search is still on to find alternative, cost-effective,
and noble metal-free catalysts. This led to the study of 3d transition
metal and metal oxide-based catalysts for CO oxidation. One such system
is the spinel form of cobalt oxide,4 and
it was demonstrated to show high catalytic activity for the CO oxidation
reaction at and below ambient temperatures.5 Although Co3O4 nanorods (Co3O4 NRs) show remarkable CO oxidation reaction at ambient and
low temperatures, their reaction mechanism is still unclear. A simple
mechanism proposed involves CO adsorption on the Co3+ site,
reaction with surface oxygen to form CO2, and ready desorbtion
from the surface.5,6 However, this does not explain
the structure or morphology dependence as observed in the literature.7−9 It is also to be noted that CO oxidation was correlated with the
number of surface Co3+ sites.7

The interaction of transition metal oxide surface with H2O plays an important role in catalysis and surface chemistry.
It
is well-known that the rate of CO oxidation is strongly affected by
the presence of water. Addition of water with the reactant feed enhances
the CO oxidation rate on supported nanogold.10,11 However, water can dissociate on the catalyst surface and diminish
the activity by deactivating the catalyst.12 Xie et al.5 evaluated the CO oxidation
using normal feed gas (3–10 ppm moisture) and suggested that
Co3O4 NR was less sensitive to water. Nonetheless,
innocuous water vapor is present everywhere to a large extent. Theoretical
studies suggest that water molecules adsorbs on the active sites of
the metal oxide, which hinders the redox cycle of the reaction and
leads to a decline in activity;12 however,
there is no direct experimental evidence available to support the
hypothesis. Hence, the question is wide open.

The above discussion
underscores the importance of gas–solid
interactions between reactants and catalyst surfaces,13 which is yet to be explored using relevant methods. However,
until now, no direct experimental studies have been reported to identify
the possible reaction pathway and the role of water vapor in suppressing
the activity. In the present article, we report a systematic study
of adsorption and oxidation of CO with O2 on Co3O4 NR catalysts using near-ambient pressure ultraviolet
photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-UPS).14,15 We present
direct spectroscopy and mass spectrometry evidence for the catalytic
activity and the influence of moisture on the catalytic activity toward
CO oxidation on Co3O4 NRs. A serious attempt
has been made to explore the mechanistic insights into the CO oxidation
activity at ambient temperatures and near-ambient pressures using
NAP-UPS. Supplementary data obtained using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) under NAP conditions are also provided.

Results and Discussion
In Situ
Catalytic Activity Measurement
A series of
controlled experiments were performed to understand the CO oxidation
activity, catalyst sustainability, and mechanism of varied CO2 production in the presence and absence of moisture. To explore
the electronic structure and the mechanistic aspects, we studied the
CO oxidation reaction using NAP-UPS at a total pressure of 0.1 mbar
under dynamic dosing conditions between ambient temperature and 400
K, along with mass spectral analysis. The reaction was studied in
the presence and absence of water vapor with various CO/O2 ratios; the best activity results were observed for the 1:3 ratio,
and hence this ratio was used to explore the electronic structure
aspects of the reaction. Individual reactants were bubbled through
liquid water at room temperature (RT) to create a wet reaction environment
for the reaction. A simple ratio of partial pressure of water to total
pressure of all reactant and product components observed using a quadrupole
mass spectrometer (QMS) indicates it to be 0.2% (approx. 1–2
× 10–3 mbar); however, this is an underestimated
value considering the difficulty in quantifying condensed water [on
the ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber walls] from the dosing point to
the measurement point using a QMS. In spite of these limitations in
the quantification of water vapor, a large change in the reactivity
and spectral data was observed because the water vapor present at
the dosing point (before condensation into chamber walls) underscores
its influence toward the catalytic activity. Under real-world conditions,
such CO oxidation catalysts are expected to work with less percentage
of water vapor, and it also depends on the application. Figure 1a,b shows the mass spectrum
measured for the kinetic results of CO conversion to CO2 between 300 and 400 K under dry and wet conditions, respectively.
The mass spectral analysis shows that the formation of CO2 observed at 300 K remains unaffected at increasing temperature,
under the moisture-free condition. However, a similar analysis performed
in the presence of water vapor showed that CO2 production
drastically decreases by more than an order of magnitude. Gradually
increasing amounts of CO2 and O2 in the first
few minutes, as can be observed in Figure 1a,b, is due to diffusion limitation; contrarily,
CO diffuses very fast (see Experimental Section for diffusion coefficients), and a sudden spurt in its partial pressure
could be observed at the beginning of the reaction. It is to be mentioned
that the QMS is kept in the preparation chamber 1.5 m away from the
NAP-UPS measurement spot.14,15 The total pressure,
which was measured to be 0.1 mbar, very close to the analysis spot,14 throughout the experiment, confirms that the
Co3O4 NR experiences the pressure applied.

recorded at 0.1 mbar total pressure with 1:3 CO/O2 ratio,
between 300 and 400 K (a) in the absence of water
vapor and (b) in the presence of 0.2% water vapor in the reaction
mixture. Blue, olive green, red, and cyan indicate the change in the
partial pressure of CO, O2, CO2, and H2O, respectively.

NAP-UPS Studies
In situ NAP-UPS analysis was used to
explore the nature of the catalyst surface under dry and wet reaction
conditions. The valence band (VB) spectra of Co3O4 NRs measured at UHV-RT are shown in Figure 2a (Figure S1a).
According to the literature,16 the VB spectrum
of the Co3O4 NR can be deconvoluted into various
bonding features of Co3+ and Co2+. The features
at 1.2 (red), 5.6 (dashed red), and 9.3 eV (dash-dotted orange) correspond
to Co3+ 3d, Co3+–O 2p, and the corresponding
satellite peak, respectively. However, Co2+ 3d (1.5 eV,
solid purple) and Co2+–O 2p
(3.9 eV, blue) feature with the corresponding satellite peaks at 2.3
(dotted purple) and 7.3 eV (dash-dotted blue), respectively. A detailed
explanation of the spectra is given in Figure S1a,b. When the reactant was fed to the catalyst, the
following major changes were observed: (i) The characteristic peak
for Co3+ 3d tends to shift to 1.3 eV at 300 K (compared
with UHV-RT VB) and again returns to 1.1 eV at 400 K (red arrow),
whereas the Co3+–O
2p peak at 5.6 eV hardly shows any shift due to reaction environment
and temperature up to 400 K. (ii) The satellite feature of Co3+ at 9.2 eV shifts to 9.6 eV up to 350 K and returns to 9.4
eV at 400 K (orange dash-dot arrow). (iii) The satellite feature of
Co2+ at 2.3 eV displays a shift of 0.35 eV toward higher
binding energy (BE) under reaction conditions (purple arrow). (iv)
The presence of CO2 vibrational features along with those
of reactants fully support CO2 formation at RT with characteristic
vibrational features at 8.6, 6.7, and 8.3 eV for CO, O2, and CO2, respectively. An additional vibrational feature
of CO2 is also observed at 12.7 eV, which further confirms
the CO oxidation at RT. (v) A shift and broadening of CO and O2 vibrational features was observed (0.23 eV), whereas that
of CO2 shifts by 0.15 eV on catalyst surfaces between 300
and 400 K. (vi) VBmax shifts to a lower BE (5.1 eV) at
300 K and broadens compared with single VBmax at UHV-RT
(5.4 eV) spectrum; it shifts further down to 4.8 eV with increasing
temperature at 400 K. This directly indicates the interaction of the
surface with gas-phase reactants. A considerable broadening in the
reactants and CO2 vibrational features is also observed,
likely due to the participation of various intermediates in the reaction
(Figure 2e,f), whereas
no broadening was observed in the gas-phase feature of gases even
at 400 K (Figure S2).

Figure 2 (a) Ultraviolet photoelectron
spectroscopy (UVPES) VB spectra of
Co3O4 NRs at UHV-RT. NAP-UPS VB features of
Co3O4 NRs recorded under dry conditions with
1:3 CO/O2 ratio at 0.1 mbar at (b) 300, (c) 350 K, and
(d) 400 K. (e) O2 and (f) CO and CO2 vibrational
features show a shift to lower BE.

Co3O4 NRs were subjected to the wet
reactant
stream to examine the change in the catalyst structure under the influence
of water vapor, and the NAP-UPS results obtained are shown in Figure 3. The VB feature
of Co3O4 NRs recorded under dry conditions at
300 K (similar to Figure 2b) is shown in Figure 3a for comparison. In the presence of water vapor, there is
no ambient temperature activity, and no CO2 feature was
observed for the catalyst. At 300 K, the presence of water vapor severely
hampers the gas-phase features of CO and O2. The intensity
of the CO and O2 vibrational features shows a large decrease
and a broadening along with a shift to a high BE (Figure 3f) compared with the spectrum
under dry conditions at 300 K (Figure 2f). Whereas O2 vibrational features recover
to the lower BE, CO features are observed at the same BE at 400 K
(red arrow in Figure 3). A broadening observed with CO features is attributed to the formation
of CO32– or −HCO/COOH species
on the surface. A broad VBmax observed between 4 and 6
eV under dry conditions (Figure 3a) contracts to 5–6 eV, with a significant decrease
in the intensity between 4 and 5 eV under wet conditions (Figure 3b–d). The
satellite feature of Co3+ at 9.6 eV (under dry conditions
at 300 K) shifts to 9.9 eV up to 350 K and returns to 9.6 eV at 400
K (under wet conditions). The presence of a broad hydroxyl feature
at 12.6 eV confirms that water is adsorbed dissociatively on the catalyst
surface.13,17 It is to be noted that the same hydroxyl
feature was observed with a low intensity at UHV-RT (refer Figure S1a) using NAP-UPS, as shown in Figure 2; this is due to
the residual water present in the vacuum
chamber. The water molecules adsorbed dissociatively on the catalyst
change the nature of the surface from predominantly oxide to hydroxide
and make it electron-rich; CO adsorption on such a surface converts
it to carbonate and/or formyl species.18 These side reactions change the nature of the surface toward carbonate-enriched
species and hinder the activity for primary CO oxidation. Hence, H2O creates a reducing environment and converts the active site
on the catalyst. It is also to be mentioned that under high pressure
measurement (0.1 mbar) conditions, no static charge development occurs;
even if such charging occurs, it is nullified by the gas phase.13−15

Figure 3 (a)
UVPES VB spectra in a moisture-free reaction environment at
300 K; (b–d) VB change of Co3O4 NRs on
varying the temperature from 300 to 400 K in the presence of water
vapor in the reaction mixture (approx. 0.2%); (e) deconvoluted CO
vibrational features at 300 and 400 K; and (f) gradual shift and broadening
of CO vibrational features with temperature under wet reaction conditions.

As the temperature increases,
the oxygen vibrational features regain
the intensity, which indicates that the presence of H2O
diminishes the affinity of the surface toward O2; H2O begins to desorb above its boiling point, and simultaneously
the surface regains the affinity toward O2. By contrast,
CO features show an entirely different behavior; they begin to diminish
in intensity, giving rise to a broad feature. This broad feature can
be deconvoluted into two features; the lower BE peak corresponds to
the CO vibrations, whereas the other feature appearing at a high BE
is due to the reaction intermediates (HCO/CO32–) (Figure 3e,f). However,
with increasing temperature, the broadening of the peak increases;
the broad feature contains CO2 and CO at ≥375 K
and shifts to a lower BE.

A detailed data analysis of the VB
spectra indicates that the nature
of catalyst surface structure changed during the course of reaction
because of which the vibration feature of all of the gas-phase features
shifted from their original BE. These vibration
features appear at a comparatively higher BE in the presence of water,
which indicates less interaction of the
incoming molecules with the catalyst surface. The experimental results
also indicate that the Co 3d electron density of the VB feature and
the corresponding interaction with O 2p has a good correlation with
the catalytic activity. No clear correlation was observed in the changes
in the Co3+ 2p core level (refer Figure S3) and the catalytic activity. A strong modification in the
electronic structure occurs in the presence of water, which reflects
in the NAP-UPS VB spectra of the catalyst under reaction conditions.

NAP-XPS Studies
Because determination of the electronic
nature of the catalyst surface and the interaction between the surface
and the adsorbed species are dependent on the understanding of the
data, a systematic deconvolution of C 1s (Figure 4a–c) and O 1s (Figure 4d–f) core levels was carried out,
the results of which are shown in Figure 4. O 1s (Figure 4d–f) spectra were deconvoluted into
two main features appearing at 529.9 (red) and 531.1 eV (green).16 Under in situ high-pressure dry reaction conditions,
a new peak at 531.8 eV (blue) was observed, which corresponds to the
adsorbed reactant molecules on the surface. In addition, under a wet
reaction environment, a minor component fitted in the O 1s spectra
at 533.2 eV (cyan) corresponds to the hydroxyl groups present on the
catalyst surface, which confirms the dissociative adsorption of water.
As the temperature increases, the intensity of this hydroxyl feature
decreases; however, the adsorbed reactant feature remains unaffected.
O 1s spectrum recorded at 400 K resembles that recorded at 300 K but
with a very low intense hydroxyl component, indicating the desorption
of the hydroxyl group at high temperatures and supporting the partial
recovery of Co3O4 NR surfaces.

Figure 4 NAP-XPS C 1s and O 1s
spectra recorded under dry and wet reaction
conditions: C 1s and O 1s spectra recorded under (a,d) dry reaction
conditions at 300 K, (b,e) wet reaction conditions at 300 K, and (c,f)
wet reaction conditions at 400 K.

Under the same conditions, C 1s spectra obtained were deconvoluted
into three main features at 284.2 (dark cyan), 286.5 (wine red), and
288.4 eV (purple). The peaks at 284.2 and 286.5 eV correspond to the
adventitious carbon and the adsorbed CO molecules on the surface.
However, the peak at 288.4 eV was assigned to the weakly adsorbed
ions of the CO2 species (CO2δ−) present on the catalyst surface,19 which
is a reaction intermediate, and subsequently desorbed to form the
actual product, CO2. Apart from the above features, the
C 1s spectrum also shows the gas-phase features of CO (291.1 eV) (dotted
wine red) and CO2 (292.1 eV) (blue). The appearance of
the product gas-phase feature confirms the formation of CO2 at RT. It should be noted that surface carbonate (Supporting Information 4) is an intermediate for CO oxidation
on metal oxide;20 however, there was no
carbonate feature observed during the dry reactant stream under our
experimental conditions.

A broad C 1s spectrum was observed
under wet conditions, which
was deconvoluted to understand the nature of reaction intermediates,
responsible for the diminished CO oxidation activity under wet reaction
conditions. Similar to the dry reaction conditions, various peaks
were observed under wet conditions for adsorbed CO (286.7 eV) (solid
wine red), CO2δ− (288.4 eV) (orange),
gas-phase CO (291.1–291.3 eV) (dotted wine red), and molecules
with adventitious C species at 284.4 eV (dark cyan) (Supporting Information 4). Shifts in the BE of various fitted
components indicate that the surface electronic structure was altered
in the presence of water vapor. Crucially, no peak was observed at
292.2 eV for gas-phase CO2. The absence of gas-phase CO2 feature at 300 K supports the mass spectral results and suggests
the deactivation of the catalyst under wet reaction conditions. Indeed,
some new features observed at 287.4 (green, formyl)21 and 289.3 (dark yellow, carbonate) correspond to new reaction
intermediates because of the interaction of water molecules with the
catalyst surface and the reactant species. When the temperature increases
above 375 K, the corresponding peak area of features at 288.7 and
289.3 eV shows a decrease (as compared with 300 K) with the appearance
of CO2 features; however, at 400 K, sufficient change in
the concentration of various intermediates with the enhancement of
CO2 gas-phase feature was observed, indicating the decomposition
of the latter intermediate (peak at 289.3 eV), facilitating CO2 production. An enhancement was observed with the feature
at 287.3 eV, which seems to be a spectator/stable intermediate for
the reaction.

There is no significant shift observed in the
Co 2p XPS spectrum,
which indicates that under reaction conditions, the bulk chemical
nature of the Co3O4 NRs remains unchanged as
identified at RT; however, the ratio of Co3+/Co2+ shows an 8–10% change with temperature under dry to wet reaction
conditions. It is also to be noted that the probing depth is approximately
5–6 nm for NAP-XPS compared with approximately 1 nm for NAP-UPS;
this allows the surface changes to reflect much better with the latter
than the former.

A simple comparison of spectra recorded at
300 and 400 K, with
and without water vapor, underscores the changes in the work function
(WF) (Supporting Information 5) of the
material, depending on the measurement conditions (Figure 5). Whereas the 400 K spectrum
displays a comparable WF for wet (5.55 eV) and dry (5.6 eV) conditions,
the 300 K spectrum shows 5.7 eV (5.0 eV) for dry (wet) conditions,
highlighting the enormous influence of water vapor at ambient temperatures.
It is also to be noted that the Co3O4 NR exhibits
the same WF (5.6–5.7 eV) between 300 and 400 K under dry conditions.
The above observation indicates that desorption of water molecules/intermediates
from the catalyst surface occurs with increase in temperature and
reverts the passive/low active catalyst surface to the active surface.
Broadening of VB under wet conditions, compared with dry conditions,
at 300 K underscores the formation of stable species. A careful analysis
reveals the introduction of a highly populated band at 12.3 eV under
wet conditions at 300 K, at the cost of 11.3 eV band observed under
dry conditions, whereas there are no significant changes observed
at 400 K between wet and dry conditions. This highlights the negligible
(strong) influence of water above 375 K (at 300 K). Co3+ feature at 1.2 eV shows a higher intensity under wet conditions
than under dry conditions at 300–400 K. This hints at the availability
of Co3+ even under wet conditions but with different anions
such as hydroxyl, formyl, or carbonate groups (see Figure 5).

wet reaction conditions at 300 and 400

Water-Induced Surface Modification
and Catalyst Deactivation
Water has a significant effect
on the activity and selectivity
of various catalytic reactions, and it strongly alters the rate of
CO oxidation depending on the catalytic systems and conditions (see Figure 6). In the present
study, we observed a diminished ambient temperature catalytic activity
for CO oxidation to CO2, in the presence of moisture (Figure 6). This can be accounted
as follows: Water molecules dissociatively adsorb and change the electronic
nature of the catalyst surface from oxide to hydroxide/oxyhydroxide
at least partially by hydroxylating the catalyst surface. Co3O4 is known to be highly electrophilic in nature and can
be hydroxylated easily at RT.17 On the
basis of the present experimental findings, it is evident that the
dissociative adsorption of water forms a layer of OH groups on the
catalyst surface. The OH groups on the Co3O4 surface hinder a direct interaction of reactant molecules (CO and
O2) with the catalyst surface, thus resulting in a diminished
catalytic activity. The presence of moisture alters the surface electronic
nature of Co3O4 from oxide to predominantly
hydroxide. The hydroxide layer (and protons) on the surface facilitates
the formation of carboxylate/formate intermediates with the incoming
CO molecules (see Figure 6b).

Interestingly, the analysis of mass spectra shows
a high consumption of CO under humid conditions at temperature ≤350
K. It is known that CO has a high affinity toward Co3+,
and hence under humid conditions, the CO molecules adsorb on the pseudo
Co3+ site; however, the catalyst surface is found to be
significantly oxyphobic in the presence of water vapor. The adsorption
of CO on the Co3+ site does lead to CO2 in the
absence of water vapor and to stable reaction intermediates, such
as carbonate and formyl, in the presence of water vapor. When the
temperature reaches ≥375 K, the OH group layer starts depleting,
and the affinity of the catalyst surface toward O2 regenerates.
Hence, the dissociative adsorption of water is apparently reversible,
and the catalyst surface partially regains its activity because of
its reoxidation to Co3O4 surface at T ≥ 375 K (see Figure 6c).

Conclusions
In summary, findings
from NAP-UPS support Co3O4 NRs as the most active
metal oxide for CO oxidation at RT in the
absence of water vapor. However, in the presence of water vapor, the
reaction is not active below 375 K because of the surface hydroxylation
(or oxyhydroxide) and associated changes in the electronic structure.
Above 375 K, CO oxidation activity was regained underscoring the desorption
of water above its boiling point leading to activity resumption; however,
the dissociative water adsorption poisons the surface below 375 K.
The decrease in WF under the wet reaction conditions underscores that
the contaminated surface is more stable than the reactive surface
found under dry reaction conditions with a high WF. Our future work
will focus on the detailed electronic structure analysis to get the
mechanistic pathway of the reaction and also to understand how water
molecules turn the reaction path and cause concomitant decline in
the catalytic activity.

Experimental Section
The Co3O4 NR was prepared using a wet chemical
synthesis method by following the procedure reported in the literature.5 Typical material characterization details are
given along with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Figure S6) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) (Figure S7) results in the Supporting
Information. XRD and HRTEM for the Co3O4 NR
were conducted and found to be similar to those of the literature
report.5 The surface electronic structure
of the catalyst during reaction conditions was studied using a custom-built
NAP photoelectron spectrometer (NAPPES) at the National Chemical Laboratory,
Pune.14,15 The core-level electronic structure was
identified with Al Kα generated by a twin-anode X-ray source;
however, the VB electronic structure was explored using UVPES recorded
with He–I (hν = 21.2 eV) photons generated
using a specially designed helium discharge lamp. The photoelectron
spectral data were acquired using a R3000HP (VG Scienta) analyzer
at a pass energy of 100 eV for XPS and 5 eV for UVPES with the analyzer
cone aperture (aperture = D) of 1.2 mm. A distance
of 1.5 mm was maintained between the material surface and the cone.
The NAPPES measurements were taken using a R3000HP (VG Scienta) analyzer.
The core level XPS measurements were taken at a pass energy of 100
eV for XPS and 5 eV for UVPES. The spectral analysis and peak deconvolution
were carried out using CASA software. Shirley background subtraction
was used for background removal. All VB studies were restricted with
the He I source, and core-level studies were explored with Al Kα.
A detailed NAP-UPS data analysis was carried out with peak deconvolution
and assignment (see Figure S1a). The appearance
of characteristic peaks of Co3+ and Co2+ with
a weak shake-up satellite feature in XPS22,23 (Figure S1b) and UVPES16 confirms the surface nature of the spinel.

A very
thin pellet was used for the NAPPES analysis in the presence
of reactants at different temperatures. All high pressure data presented
in this article were obtained at 0.1 mbar reactant pressure; NAPPES
data collection was recorded between 300 and 400 K. The reaction was
studied in the presence and absence of water vapor with 1:3 CO/O2 ratio. To create a wet reaction environment, the individual
reactants were bubbled through liquid water at RT. Condensation of
water molecules was observed throughout the chamber, which is unavoidable.
The mass spectral analysis was carried out by interconnecting the
analysis chamber to the QMS (SRS RGA 200) placed in the preparation
chamber through a bellow and a leak valve kept close to the QMS. All
of the reactants and products diffuse from the analysis chamber to
a long distance (∼1.5 m) and leaked through the leak valve
for measurements. Hence, QMS measurements can be considered, at best,
as semiquantitative. However, the diffusion coefficient of the relevant
gas-phase species in air at 1 atm is as follows: CO = 2020 m2/s; O2 = 1880 m2/s; and CO2 = 1570
m2/s; this supports the pressure changes observed in Figure 1. Several control
experiments, including CO + O2 dosing in the absence of
catalyst, were carried out to confirm that the CO oxidation activity
arises only from the catalyst; however, no CO2 production
was observed, demonstrating that there is no inherent activity of
the UHV chamber walls or any component within the NAPPES system for
the reaction. The ambient temperature activity of the catalyst was
also confirmed in a typical fixed-bed atmospheric pressure reactor,
and the ambient temperature activity was confirmed.
