With
the gradually increasing demand for solving the environmental
pollution problem and energy crisis, efficient photocatalysts with
superior charge carrier separation and transfer ability have attracted
extensive research attention. Herein, n-type CdS-decorated p-Cu2O/n-ZnO nanorod arrays (CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs), integrating
the merits of both highly ordered structure and synergistic effect
derived from dual p–n junctions, were successfully fabricated
and further applied to photoelectrocatalysis. In this ternary nanocomposite,
fast generation, separation, and transfer of charge carriers were
achieved in the Cu2O/ZnO and Cu2O/CdS dual p–n
junction regions due to their built-in electric field and appropriate
band structures. Moreover, both highly ordered ZnO NRAs and compact
CdS shell play the role of an electron collector and a transport channel
that efficiently consumes the photoinduced electrons in the conduction
band of Cu2O, which considerably reduces the recombination
rate of charge carriers. As expected, the perfect cooperation of the
three participators leads to the highest
photoconversion efficiency of 2.61% at −0.275 V (versus saturated
calomel electrode) and an incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency
of 14.51% at 380 nm as well as the photoelectrocatalytic degradation
ability of the optimized 30 min CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanode
as compared to that of the Cu2O/ZnO and ZnO NRAs photoanodes.
It is believed that the induced synergistic effect between dual p–n
junctions and ZnO NRAs caused the superior performances of the CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanode, and this ternary material with a unique
structure may present a new way of thinking for potential applications
in the photoelectrochemistry field.

Introduction
Highly efficient charge
carrier separation and transfer are of
critical importance for photocatalytic efficiency in a semiconductor
material, yet it is hard to achieve in the case of a single semiconductor
due to the serious recombination rate of charge carriers and photocorrosion.
Therefore, one of the focuses in the recent photocatalytic technology
is the construction of single semiconductor-based heterostructured
materials to reduce the charge carrier recombination and promote the
photocatalytic activity. Noble metal doping to form a metal/semiconductor
hybrid with an Ohmic junction or other semiconductor coupling to form
a heterostructure with a Schottky junction is quite beneficial for
the separation of charge carriers due to the role of the noble metal
as an electron sink in the former case or the development of an internal
self-built electric field, which provides enough space charge layer,
in the latter case.1,2 Notably, the rational design and
synthesis of a heterostructure composed of n-type and p-type semiconductors
are a feasible strategy to solve this issue.3 The formed p–n junction with a depletion layer in the interfacial
region subsequently induces an internal self-built electric field,
then promotes the separation efficiency of charge carriers and boosts
the photocatalytic activity.4 In addition,
the p–n junction can accurately and effectively dominate the
separation distance, transfer direction, and restrain the recombination
rate of charge carriers.5 Fully taking
advantages of the superiority in charge carrier separation and transfer,
lots of p–n heterojunctions, such as p-MoS2/n-rGO,6 p-LaFeO3/n-Fe2O3,7 p-BiOI/n-ZnO,8 and so forth, have been successfully manufactured, and as expected
exhibited enhanced photoelectrochemical water-splitting performance
and photocatalytic activity as compared to those of the single semiconductor.

Among various n-type semiconductors, wide band gap zinc oxide (ZnO),
especially with highly ordered one-dimensional arrays, attracts tremendous
research attention due to its remarkable physicochemical properties,
such as tunable alignment and morphology, high aspect ratio, deep-level
defects, and a relatively large excitation binding energy of 60 meV.9,10 These above merits spontaneously lead to the wide application of
ZnO in photocatalysis (PC),11 solar cells,12 and supercapacitors.13 Unfortunately, the practical application of ZnO is severely hindered
by its wide band gap (∼3.2 eV), which restricts its use to
the ultraviolet light region, and the high recombination rate of charge
carriers relentlessly causes poor photocatalytic activity. Therefore,
it is still a challenging task to exploit new approaches for improving
the visible light absorption ability and photocatalytic activity.
Recently, cuprous oxide (Cu2O) has attracted extensive
interest toward applications in photoelectrochemical hydrogen production,14 photocatalytic degradation,15 and solar cells16 because of
its narrow band gap (∼2.2 eV), which matches well the solar
visible spectrum. Moreover, as
one of the few p-type direct band gap semiconductors, Cu2O has attracted interest as a promising candidate with great application
potential in the construction of p–n junctions to serve as
an efficient light absorber and photoinduced electron provider. To
date, many Cu2O-based p–n heterostructures, such
as Cu2O/TiO2,17 Cu2O/TaON,18 Cu2O/Fe2O3,19 and so forth,
have been successfully prepared. In these nanomaterials, the space
charge layer created by the nanoscale p–n junctions will not
only promote the generation but also considerably suppress the recombination
rate of charge carriers. It is worth noting that ZnO and Cu2O have a particular
relative position of the band gap, where the conduction band minimum
of Cu2O lies at a more negative position than that of ZnO;
meanwhile, the valence band maximum of ZnO lies at a more positive
position than that of Cu2O.20 The staggered band gap structure of ZnO and Cu2O followed
the typical type-II mode, which could cause effective spatial separation
and transfer of charge carriers, thus reducing the internal charge
recombination and enhancing the photocatalytic activity.21 Therefore, constructing a Cu2O/ZnO
heterostructure would make full use of the merits of
the p–n junction and the type-II mode band gap structure to
significantly improve the separation and transfer ability and hence
result in enhanced photocatalytic performance.

Regrettably,
Cu2O usually displays poor photocatalytic
activity and could be deactivated by photocorrosion.22 Furthermore, Cu+ could be easily oxidized to
form Cu2+ when Cu2O is exposed to light illumination,
and non-negligible charge carrier recombination still exists in Cu2O due to its short minority carrier transport length.23 So, it is imperative to improve the stability
of Cu2O. To overcome this problem, we have introduced CdS,
which is stable when exposed to light illumination, and successfully
prepared a highly ordered CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanode.
As CdS belongs to an n-type semiconductor with a suitable band gap
structure, dual p–n junctions (p-Cu2O/n-ZnO and
p-Cu2O/n-CdS) were formed in this ternary structure. In
this ternary nanocomposite, fast generation, separation, and transfer
of charge carriers were achieved in the Cu2O/ZnO and Cu2O/CdS dual p–n junction regions due to their built-in
electric field and appropriate band structures. Moreover, both highly
ordered ZnO NRAs and compact CdS shell play the role of the electron
collector and transport channel that efficiently consumes the photoinduced
electrons in the conduction band of Cu2O, which significantly
reduces the recombination rate of charge carriers. As a consequence,
the introduction of CdS has been proved to be an effective strategy
to realize superior photoelectrochemical performance and photocatalytic
activity for the CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanode, which can
be ascribed to the induced synergistic effect between dual p–n
junctions and ZnO NRAs as well as the compact CdS shell layer. Therefore,
the fabricated ternary nanomaterial with a unique structure and superior
performances may present a new way of thinking for potential applications
in the photoelectrochemistry field.

Results and Discussion
The phases of the as-prepared samples are examined and the typical
XRD patterns are shown in Figure 1. Several strong diffraction peaks corresponding to
the hexagonal wurtzite phase of ZnO (JCPDS card no. 36-1451; lattice
parameters: a = b = 3.25 Å, c = 5.21 Å) can be found in all of the samples, indicating
the stable existence of ZnO NRAs as a primary supporter to maintain
the deposition of Cu2O and CdS, as well as the timely and
rapid transfer of photoinduced electrons, thus prolonging the lifetime
of charge carriers. For the Cu2O/ZnO pattern, four peaks
located at 29.6, 42.4, 61.5, and 73.7° can be well indexed to
the (110), (200), (220), and (311) lattice planes of cubic-phase Cu2O (JCPDS card no. 65-3288; lattice parameters: a = b = c = 4.26 Å). Furthermore,
five peaks located at 24.8, 26.5, 28.2, 43.7, and 51.8° in the
CdS/Cu2O/ZnO pattern matches well with the (100), (002),
(101), (110), and (112) lattice planes of hexagonal-phase CdS (JCPDS
card no.41-1049; lattice parameters: a = b = 4.14 Å, c = 6.72 Å). The
diffraction peaks of Cu2O and CdS are relatively weak compared
to those of ZnO, due to the continuous growth of the (002) lattice
plane along the [001] direction in the ZnO nanorod. Moreover, the
sharp and intense diffraction peaks of ZnO, Cu2O, and CdS
indicate their good crystalline nature. No traces of other peaks were
observed, confirming the high purity of the three products.

of the ZnO, Cu2O/ZnO, and CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs
photoanodes.

Figure 2 shows the
morphology and microstructure information of the representative 30
min CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs. The surface morphology was studied
using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Figure 2a,b, CdS/Cu2O/ZnO
NRAs were observed to be vertically aligned on the fluorine tin oxide
(FTO) substrate with an average diameter of 350–370 nm, which
increased by about 50–100 nm than that of the pure ZnO nanorod
with a diameter of about 300 nm (see the Supporting Information, Figure S1a,b). Moreover, the surface of the CdS/Cu2O/ZnO nanorod became rough instead of the hexagonal and smooth
surface of the ZnO nanorod. It can be observed that the hexagonal
and smooth surface also disappears of Cu2O/ZnO NRAs, and
the average diameter is about 330 nm (Figure S1c,d), which reasonably falls between those of the ZnO and CdS/Cu2O/ZnO nanorods. Figure 2c shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of
one representative CdS/Cu2O/ZnO nanorod; the calculated
diameter is consistent with that in the SEM images. Figure 2d exhibits the high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) image, the distinct lattice fringe reveals the highly
crystalline nature of CdS/Cu2O/ZnO. The lattice fringe
spacing of 0.260 nm can be indexed to the (002) plane of wurtzite-phase
ZnO. Moreover, the lattice fringe spacings of 0.213 and 0.207 nm match
well with the interplanar distances of the (200) and (110) planes
of cubic-phase Cu2O and hexagonal-phase CdS, respectively.
Notably, the interface between each component is quite compact and
continuous, which could benefit the spatial vectorial transfer of
charge carriers, and achieves superior photoelectrochemical performances. Figure 2e–i shows
the element mapping images, including Zn, O, Cu, Cd, and S, which
matches well with the EDS spectrum (Figure S2). Furthermore, these elements evenly distribute over the hybrid,
further revealing the attainment of the ternary nanocomposite. Meanwhile,
the homogeneous distribution of each element also demonstrates the
dense and consecutive contact among these components.

min CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs, and (e–i) EDX elemental mapping
images of Zn, O, Cu, Cd, and S, respectively.

To gain more insight into the surface electronic states and
compositions
of the photoanode, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement
was further conducted. Figure 3a presents the XPS survey spectrum of the CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanode, and the peaks of Zn 2p, Cu 2p, O 1s, Cd 3d,
S 2p, and C 1s can be clearly observed. The peak of C 1s came from
adsorbed CO2 on the sample surface or adventitious hydrocarbon
from the XPS instrument itself. Figure 3b shows two symmetric peaks at binding energies of
1021.8 and 1044.9 eV assigned to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively, indicating the existence of ZnO in the CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanode.24 The two
peaks centered at 932.3 and 952.3 eV shown in Figure 3c are attributed to Cu 2p3/2 and
Cu 2p1/2, respectively, which are characteristic of Cu+ in Cu2O.25 Meanwhile,
the characteristic and satellite peaks associated with Cu2+ species were not observed, suggesting negligible surface oxidation
of Cu2O/ZnO in the presence of CdS. Besides two strong
peaks assigned to Cu+ at 932.3 and 952.1 eV, two smaller
peaks, located at 934.5 and 954.2 eV, correspond to Cu2+ in CuO (Figure S3c).26 The appearance of two extra shake-up satellite peaks at
higher binding energies of 943.7 and 962.7 eV also reveals the existence
of Cu2+ on the photoanode surface.27 The above results suggested that the introduced CdS may serve as
a protective layer that prevents Cu2O from being oxidized
to some extent, which conduces to enhance the stability of Cu2O. The high-resolution spectrum of Cd 3d in Figure 3d with featured peaks of 3d5/2 at 405.3 eV and 3d3/2 at 412.1 eV indicates
+2 oxidation state (Cd2+) in the as-prepared CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanode.28 Two peaks
located at 161.6 and 162.8 eV in Figure 3e are attributed to S 2p3/2 and
S 2p1/2, respectively, which are associated with the hybrid
chemical bond species of S2– in Cd–S.29 Meanwhile, the O 1s peak shown in Figure 3f can be deconvoluted into
three peaks at 531.2, 531.9, and 532.5 eV, which correspond to the
O2– in the Cu2O crystal (O1 peak),30 Zn–O bonds of ZnO (O2 peak),31 and the oxygen species
on the surface (O3 peak),32 respectively.
Therefore, the above analytical results demonstrate the successful
preparation of a chemically coupled CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanode.

Survey, (b) Zn 2p, (c) Cu 2p, (d) Cd 3d, (e) S 2p, and (f) O 1s.

The photoelectrochemical properties
of these ZnO NRAs-based photoanodes
were then investigated in a three-electrode cell using a Pt foil as
the counter electrode and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the
reference electrode in 0.5 M Na2SO4 + 0.1 M
Na2S electrolyte (pH = 12.99). Figure 4a shows the photocurrent–voltage (I–V) curves of the ZnO, Cu2O/ZnO, and
CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanodes under visible light illumination
(300 W Xe lamp, 100 mW cm–2) in a potential scan
range of −0.8 to 1.2 V versus SCE. The bare ZnO NRAs photoanode
shows
an almost negligible current density in the full potential range,
due to its poor ability of visible light absorption, which leads to
the inability to generate photoinduced electron–hole pairs.
After the deposition of Cu2O, an enhanced current density
was obtained over the entire potential range, which arrived at a maximum
value of 8.40 mA/cm2 at 1.2 V. Dramatically, after introducing
CdS, the CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanode showed apparent enhancement
in current density; the 30 min CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanode
exhibited a maximum value of 14.93 mA/cm2 at the same applied
voltage. These calculated current densities are also listed (Table S1), and the induced current density of
other prepared photoanodes under light illumination are compared (Table S2). The improved photocurrent density
may be attributed to the fact that the introduction of CdS would not
only assemble the photoinduced electrons from Cu2O but
also act as hole donors to facilitate the irreversible consumption
of holes by sacrificial reagents, so that the recombination of photoinduced
electron–hole pairs at the surface of interface areas of CdS/Cu2O/ZnO could be reduced. When ZnO was decorated only by CdS,
it can be seen that the CdS/ZnO NRAs photoanode shows a higher photocurrent
density than that of the bare ZnO NRAs photoanode but lower value
than those of the CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanodes (Figure S4), revealing the substantially enhanced
electron–hole pair separation efficiency after combining CdS
with Cu2O. On the other hand, due to the intimate contact
of Cu2O and ZnO, photoinduced electrons enriched in the
conduction band of Cu2O can be injected to ZnO via the
Zn–O–Cu bonds. As a result, the ZnO
nanorod can function as an electron collector and transfer the electrons
to the counter electrode to generate H2. The synergistic
effect between ZnO and CdS can significantly restrain the recombination
rate of photoinduced electron–hole pairs in Cu2O,
thus leading to a superior photoelectrochemical performance compared
to that of Cu2O/ZnO. In addition, this effect could also
be verified from the I–V curves under dark
conditions shown in Figure 4b. As expected, CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanodes exhibited
a much higher current density than Cu2O/ZnO and ZnO NRAs
photoanodes at the same potential, demonstrating that CdS played a
significant role in the separation and transfer of photoinduced electron-hole
pairs. To quantitatively evaluate the efficiency of water-splitting
performance of the photoanodes, the photoconversion efficiency (PCE)
deduced from Figure 4a is calculated from the following equation33 1  where J is the photocurrent
density at the measured potential, Eθrev is the standard reversible potential for the water-splitting
reaction (1.23 V), ERHE is the applied
potential versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and Jlight is the irradiance intensity (100 mW cm–2). As shown in Figure 4c, the 30 min CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanode
achieves the highest efficiency of 2.61% at a very low bias of −0.275
V versus SCE; it is already 2.72 and 261 times higher than that of
the Cu2O/ZnO (0.96% at −0.215 V versus SCE) and
ZnO (0.01% at −0.085 V versus SCE) NRAs photoanodes, respectively.
These results quantitatively demonstrate that more efficient photoinduced
electron–hole pairs separation and transfer rate were achieved
in CdS/Cu2O/ZnO dual p–n junctions.

potential curves of the ZnO, Cu2O/ZnO, and CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanodes (a) under

calculated photoconversion efficiencies, (d) incident photon-to-current
conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves of the ZnO, Cu2O/ZnO,
and CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanodes.

Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) is
another
vital measurement to quantitatively investigate the photoelectrochemical
performance. Herein, the as-prepared photoanodes were examined using
the IPCE curves at wavelengths ranging from 380 to 600 nm with an
applied bias of 0.2 V versus SCE. Moreover, the IPCE is calculated
using the equation as follows34 2  where I denotes the photocurrent
density at 0.2 V versus SCE at a certain wavelength, λ is the
incident light wavelength, and Ilight is
the irradiance intensity for a specific wavelength. As shown in Figure 4d, all CdS/Cu2O/ZnO samples exhibited enhanced IPCE as compared to that
of Cu2O/ZnO and ZnO. With prolonging of the CdS deposition
time, the IPCE of CdS/Cu2O/ZnO exhibited an increasing
trend, and the 30 min CdS/Cu2O/ZnO showed the largest IPCE
enhancement. However, with further increase in the CdS deposition
time, the IPCE of CdS/Cu2O/ZnO progressively reduced, which
is consistent with the above photoelectrochemical performances. The
30 min CdS/Cu2O/ZnO achieves the highest IPCE of 14.51%
at 380 nm, which is about 2 and 20 times higher than those of Cu2O/ZnO (IPCE380 nm = 7.08%) and ZnO (IPCE380 nm = 0.73%). The results show that introduction of
an appropriate amount of CdS onto Cu2O/ZnO to form dual
p–n junctions can realize the highly efficient generation,
separation, and transfer of charge carriers. In addition, the enhancement
of IPCE is highly dependent on the CdS deposition time. As the deposition
time increased to 40 min, the IPCE of CdS/Cu2O/ZnO showed
a decreasing trend, revealing that the charge carrier separation and
transfer in CdS/Cu2O/ZnO deteriorated as the CdS thickness
increased. This phenomenon may be ascribed to the following two factors:
excess CdS aggregated on the surface could form a charge carrier recombination
center to reduce the PCE. On the other hand, excessively thick CdS
could weaken the incident light absorption of Cu2O, which
suppresses the generation rate of charge carriers. Therefore, a suitable
CdS shell coating on Cu2O/ZnO could achieve the most effective
photoelectrochemical performance as well as PCE.

To further
confirm the enhanced photoinduced electron–hole
pair separation and transfer properties in the p–n heterojunction,
Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots were collected by conducting
impedance-potential spectroscopy at 10 kHz in 0.5 M Na2SO4 + 0.1 M Na2S solution over a range of potentials
from −0.7 to −0.3 V versus SCE. The M–S measurement
is based on the Schottky barrier formed between the semiconductor
materials and electrolytes and is commonly employed to determine the
carrier density.35,36 The slope of such plots is usually
used to judge the n-type semiconductor with a positive slope and p-type
semiconductor with a negative slope, and also to estimate the carrier
density. Figure 5a
shows the M–S plots of the ZnO NRAs photoanode that are expressed
as 1/C2 versus potential, where C is the space charge capacitance of the semiconductor electrode.
It can be seen that the ZnO NRAs photoanode showed a positive slope,
revealing the n-type behavior. It is well known that Cu2O is a p-type semiconductor; dramatically, when ZnO was coupled with
Cu2O to form a heterostructure, an apparent inverted “V-shaped”
p–n junction characteristic was observed in Figure 5b, indicating the successful
construction of a p–n junction in the Cu2O/ZnO NRAs
photoanode. CdS is an n-type semiconductor, which can be verified
from our previous research work.36 After
depositing CdS, the inverted “V-shaped” characteristic
still existed in the M–S plots of the CdS/Cu2O/ZnO
NRAs photoanode (Figure 5c), suggesting that the introduction of CdS would not damage the
p–n junction, which is more better for the separation and transfer
of charge carriers. In addition, the carrier density (N) of the samples can be calculated using the following equation37 3  where ε is the dielectric constant
of
the semiconductor, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum
(8.854 × 10–12 F m–1), e0 is the electronic charge unit (1.602 ×
10–19 C), and V is the potential
applied at the electrode. The carrier densities of these samples
are calculated and listed in Table S1;
the 30 min CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanode retained about
2 and 5 orders of magnitude higher carrier density than those of the
Cu2O/ZnO and ZnO NRAs photoanodes, respectively, indicating
that the nanoscale p–n junctions of Cu2O/ZnO and
Cu2O/CdS not only create enough space charge to enhance
charge carrier creation but also facilitate the separation efficiency,
thus effectively reducing the recombination rate of charge carriers.
The 30 min CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanode exhibited the highest
current density and carrier density as compared to other samples,
demonstrating that the optimal deposition time of CdS is 30 min (Figure S5). From the UV–vis diffuse reflectance
spectra (DRS) of the as-prepared samples, it can be observed that
there is an apparent enhancement of visible light absorption with
the decoration of CdS (Figure S6), which
may be attributed to the strong absorption of CdS in the visible light
region. Notably, the absorbance of CdS/Cu2O/ZnO samples
initially increases with increasing CdS deposition time but decreases
for the 40 min CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanode; this may be
caused by excess CdS covering on the surface of Cu2O, contrarily
blocking the incidence of visible light, thus reducing the generation
of charge carriers. Moreover, deposition of a relatively thicker CdS
layer with a long channel for photoinduced electron transfer from
Cu2O to CdS would increase the recombination rate of charge
carriers in the transfer process.

Figure 5 (a–c) M–S plots of the ZnO,
Cu2O/ZnO,
and CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanodes in the dark at a frequency
of 10 kHz and a current of 5 mV with a three-electrode system, (d)
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra of the ZnO, Cu2O/ZnO, and CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanodes recorded
at 0.2 V versus SCE in the dark.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is considered
to be
a fundamental theoretical technique to investigate the interfacial
charge transfer property of an electrode. Generally, charge transfer
resistance (Rct) of the electrode surface
can be reflected as the semicircle diameter of EIS curves, which controls
the charge transfer kinetics of the redox probe at the electrode interface.38Figure 5d shows the EIS plots of the as-prepared photoanodes recorded
at 0.2 V versus SCE under visible light illumination. It can be seen
that Rct of CdS/Cu2O/ZnO is
much smaller as compared to those of ZnO and Cu2O/ZnO,
demonstrating that Rct is considerably
reduced by introducing CdS to form dual p–n junctions, which
can substantially promote the separation efficiency and suppress the
recombination rate of charge carriers. Furthermore, Rct of these photoanodes decreases in the following sequence
order: ZnO > Cu2O/ZnO > 10 min CdS/Cu2O/ZnO
> 20 min CdS/Cu2O/ZnO > 40 min CdS/Cu2O/ZnO
> 30 min CdS/Cu2O/ZnO; these results are highly consistent
with their photoelectrochemical behavior and M–S plots. Therefore,
the formation of dual p–n junctions and the reduced Rct are considered to be the other significant
factors for enhancing the photoelectrochemical performance and the
organic pollutant degradation activity discussed in what follows.

The photoelectrocatalysis (PEC), photocatalysis (PC), and electrocatalysis
(EC) performances of ZnO (Z), Cu2O/ZnO (ZC), and CdS/Cu2O/ZnO (ZCC) NRAs photoanodes were evaluated by degrading 0.1
mM Rhodamine B (RhB) solution under visible light illumination with
an anodic bias of 1.5 V versus SCE. As seen from Figure 6a–c, compared to those
of the ZnO and Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanodes, the EC, PC, and
PEC performances of the CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanode are
improved. However, compared with PEC, the EC and PC processes of ZnO,
Cu2O/ZnO, and CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanodes
all exhibit relatively lower degradation efficiency, revealing that
the combination of illumination and external applied potential can
substantially enhance the catalytic activity and the external voltage
can improve the separation and transfer efficiency of photoinduced
electro–hole pairs. Thus, the degradation efficiencies of these
photoanodes comply with the following order for each catalytic process:
CdS/Cu2O/ZnO > Cu2O/ZnO > ZnO. Furthermore,
the 30 min CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanode exhibits the highest
degradation ability in all catalytic processes, which is consistent
with the photoelectrochemical measurement results. The superior degradation
ability of the 30 min CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanode can
be attributed to the construction of dual p–n junctions that
efficiently separate the charge carriers. Meanwhile, deposition of
an appropriate amount of CdS results in the maximum absorptivity for
incident visible light, leading to the maximum generation of charge
carriers.

on ZnO, Cu2O/ZnO, and CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanodes,
respectively. (d) Photocatalytic degradation rates of RhB solution

As mentioned
above, the dual p–n heterostructured CdS/Cu2O/ZnO
NRAs electrode is demonstrated to be one of the ideal
photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting and photoelectrocatalytic
degradation. Owing to the nanorod-forest character, ZnO NRAs provide
effective electron percolation pathways, high surface-to-volume ratio
for more reactive sites, and more effective harvest of the light.
Moreover, the coarse surface of the CdS shell reduces the reflection
of the incident light, so as to increase the utilization of incident
light.39 The uniform core–shell
structure with a high-quality heterojunction leads to efficient light
absorption and effective separation of charge carriers. Figure 7 shows the proposed mechanism
for the superior catalytic property of the PEC process. Under visible
light illumination, direct narrow band gap Cu2O and CdS
with a high absorption coefficient act as excellent visible light
absorbers to generate charge carriers. Owing to the p–n junction
formed in Cu2O/ZnO, photoinduced electrons in the conduction
band of Cu2O flow to that of ZnO, where the ZnO NRAs serve
as a continuous and fast electron transport channel to further transfer
the electrons to the FTO substrate and external circuit. Simultaneously,
the p–n junction formed in Cu2O/CdS also impels
the photoinduced electrons to flow to CdS, where CdS serves as a reduction
site to consume the electrons. The stepwise band structure of Cu2O/ZnO and Cu2O/CdS p–n junctions limits
the flux of electrons and effectively reduces the recombination rate,
thereby leading to the efficient separation of charge carriers.8 Meanwhile, photoinduced holes in the valence
band of CdS are transferred to that of Cu2O, which then
react with the hole scavengers S2–. On the other
hand, CdS may act as a passivation layer, preventing Cu2O from being oxidized to some extent, which is beneficial to keep
the valence state stability of Cu2O. The enhancement of
photoelectrochemical performance and organic pollutant degradation
ability of the CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanode is higher than
the sum of that of Cu2O/ZnO and ZnO NRAs photoanodes, indicating
that the synergistic effect among dual p–n junctions, ZnO NRAs,
and the CdS shell is extremely favorable for charge carrier separation
and transportation.

mechanism.

Trapping experiments for the main
reactive species, such as hole
(h+), superoxide radicals (•O2–), and hydroxyl radical (•OH)
are conducted to further investigate the possible catalytic mechanism
and transfer trails of the photoinduced electron–hole pairs
in CdS/Cu2O/ZnO dual p–n junctions. Typically, 5
mL of triethanolamine (TEOA) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) were added
into the RhB solution to serve as scavengers of h+ and •OH,40,41 respectively. Meanwhile, N2 purging (200 mL min–1) was performed as
an •O2– scavenger.42 As shown in Figure 6d, few changes occurred for the RhB degradation
rate in the presence of TEOA, revealing that h+ might not
affect the degradation process under visible light illumination. Dramatically,
there is an obvious decrease in RhB degradation efficiency upon the
addition of IPA and N2, suggesting that •OH and/or •O2– may
serve as the main reactive species in the PC degradation process.
It is worth noting that the degradation rate of RhB solution using
IPA was lower than that of N2 purging, which suggests that •OH may play the most primary role in the PC degradation
process. On the basis of the above trapping experiment results, the
proposed charge carrier separation and transfer path in the PC process
of the CdS/Cu2O/ZnO dual p–n heterostructure were
provided and are displayed in Figure 8. When CdS is decorated on Cu2O/ZnO to form
dual p–n junctions, two built-in
electric fields with positive (filled with holes) and negative (filled
with electrons) regions would develop to efficiently transfer the
electrons to the conduction band of ZnO and CdS. Under visible light
illumination, the separated electrons participate in the photoreduction
reactions, and the formed main reactive species could effectively
degrade the dye molecules eventually. In addition, the proposed action
trails for the main reactive species were put forward as follows 4   5   6   7   8   9   10   11

Conclusions
In summary, an n-type
CdS-decorated Cu2O/ZnO p–n
heterostructured nanorod array (n-CdS/p-Cu2O/n-ZnO NRAs)
photoanode with superior performance was successfully fabricated via
electrochemical and chemical bath deposition (CBD) processes. The
optimized 30 min CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanode exhibited
the highest current density of 14.93 mA cm–2 compared
to the Cu2O/ZnO (8.40 mA cm–2) and ZnO
(0.38 mA cm–2) NRAs photoanodes under visible light
illumination. The PCE of the CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanode
was significantly enhanced in the visible light region by introducing
CdS to form dual p–n junctions, which greatly facilitated the
separation and transfer of charge carriers. In such a ternary configuration,
fast generation, separation, and transfer of charge carriers were
achieved in the Cu2O/ZnO and Cu2O/CdS dual p–n
junction region; n-type ZnO NRAs and the CdS shell played the role
of the electron collector and transport channel, and the perfect cooperation
of the three participators effectively reduced the recombination rate
of charge carriers. The above factors are supposed to be the main
reasons for the generation of the enhanced photoelectrochemical performance
and photocatalytic activity of the CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanode.
This work demonstrates that such an n-CdS/p-Cu2O/n-ZnO
NRAs photoanode has great potential applications in the field of photoelectrochemical
water splitting and photoelectrocatalytic degradation.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals and Materials
Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, C6H12N4 (HMT),
NH4Ac, CuSO4·5H2O, lactic acid
(C3H6O3), NaOH, Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, thiourea (CN2H4S), TEOA, IPA, nitrogen (N2), and Rhodamine B (RhB)
were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai,
China). All of the reagents were of analytical grade and used directly
without further purification.

Synthesis of the Cu2O/ZnO NRAs Photoanode
The Cu2O/ZnO NRAs
photoanode was synthesized through a
simple two-step electrochemical deposition method on a clean FTO (with
a sheet resistance of 14 Ω) substrate. First, the ZnO NRAs photoanode
was prepared according to the previous report;43 an aqueous solution composed of 0.02 M Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.01 M NH4Ac, and
0.01 M HMT was used as the electrolyte, and the deposition procedure
was carried out in an oil bath for 50 min at a temperature of 90 °C
under the potential of −2.0 mA cm–2, with
a graphite rod serving as the counter electrode. Second, the electrodeposition
of Cu2O on the ZnO NRAs was conducted in an alkaline aqueous
solution containing 0.4 M CuSO4·5H2O and
3 M lactic acid whose pH value was adjusted to 12 by adding NaOH solid.
The electrodeposition process was performed potentiostatically at
−0.5 V, and the deposition time was fixed at 10 min; moreover,
the solution was kept at 80 °C during the entire process. To
avoid etching of the ZnO nanorod or any possible surface corrosion,
the negative potential was applied immediately after immersing the
ZnO NRAs in the solution.

Fabrication of the CdS/Cu2O/ZnO
NRAs Photoanode
Deposition of CdS on the Cu2O/ZnO
NRAs photoanode was
carried out via the facile CBD method, and the fabrication process
is presented in Scheme 1. In the typical process, an aqueous solution composed of 0.01 M
Cd(NO3)2·4H2O and 0.01 M CN2H4S served as the electrolyte for CdS deposition.
The FTO substrate grown with Cu2O/ZnO NRAs was immersed
into the above solution for different times to eventually prepare
the CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanode with different thicknesses
of the CdS shell. The CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs photoanodes with
CdS deposition times of 10, 20, 30, and 40 min were denoted as 10
min CdS/Cu2O/ZnO, 20 min CdS/Cu2O/ZnO, 30 min
CdS/Cu2O/ZnO, and 40 min CdS/Cu2O/ZnO, respectively.

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration for the Fabrication Process of the CdS/Cu2O/ZnO NRAs Photoanode
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement
was conducted on a PANalytical, PW3040/60 diffractometer with monochromatized
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). The surface morphology
and crystal microstructure of the as-prepared samples were examined
using a field-emission SEM (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-7001F) equipped with
an energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) device and TEM (JEM2010-HR).
Surface electronic states and compositions of the sample were analyzed
by XPS (ESCALab250). The UV–vis DRS of the samples were obtained
over a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Cary 300) using BaSO4 as a reference.

Water-Splitting Performances
The
electrochemical workstation
(CHI 760D, China Chenhua) equipped with a single compartment quartz
cell with a three-electrode system was adopted to evaluate the water-splitting
performances of the as-prepared samples. The as-prepared photoanode
(available working area was 2.25 cm2), saturated calomel
electrode (SCE), and Pt sheet (1 × 1 cm2) were employed
as the working electrode, reference electrode, and counter electrode,
respectively. A 0.5 M Na2SO4 + 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solution (pH = 12.99) served as the electrolyte,
and a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a 420 nm cut-off optical filter
was placed parallel to the photoelectrochemical system, where the
distance was fixed at 8 cm from the quartz cell to the light source.
For PCE calculations, the electrode potential versus SCE is converted
to the RHE potential according to the Nernst equation: ERHE = ESCE + 0.059pH + EθSCE, where ERHE is the converted applied potential versus RHE, ESCE is the applied potential versus reference
SCE, EθSCE is the standard
SCE electrode potential at 25 °C (0.244 V), and pH for the electrolyte
is 12.99.

Photoelectrocatalytic Degradation Measurements
The
photoelectrocatalytic ability of the photoanode was examined by degrading
RhB solution. Generally, 50 mL of 0.5 M Na2SO4 + 0.1 M Na2S solution containing 4 mL of 0.1 mM RhB solution
was used as the electrolyte. Before light irradiation, the photoanode
was immersed and fixed vertically in the solution for 30 min in the
dark to establish an adsorption/desorption equilibrium of dye molecules
on catalysts. Moreover, a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a 420 nm cut-off
optical filter was introduced into the system, and a constant applied
bias of 1.5 V was employed to impel the transfer of photoinduced electrons
from the working electrode to the counter electrode. At a regular
time interval of 20 min, 3 mL of the solution was collected and analyzed
using a UV–vis absorption spectrometer to determine the degradation
rate (η) of RhB solution using the following equation 12  where C0 is the
initial concentration of RhB solution, Ct is the concentration of that at different intervals during the degradation
process.
