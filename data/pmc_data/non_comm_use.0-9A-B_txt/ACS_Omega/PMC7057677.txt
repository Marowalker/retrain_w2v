Synthetic
cannabinoids (SCs) were developed to mimic the effects
of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol on humans. SCs were distributed
in the form of herbal blends, with smoking being the main method of
consumption. These synthetic compounds have a wide range of physical,
behavioral, and harmful effects on the body. However, this study aimed
to identify and quantify three common SCs including AB-FUBINACA, AB-CHMINACA,
and XLR-11 in the seized materials from the Jordanian market by gas
chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC–MS). A liquid–liquid
extraction sample preparation technique was applied to 100 different
seized samples obtained from the Anti-Narcotics Department of Public
Security in a period between 2017 and 2018. Profiling of the seized
samples revealed different distributions of the targeted SCs in the
obtained samples. Upon quantitation, concentrations of these SCs varied
greatly within and among the samples. The use of GC–MS analysis
provided a powerful technique in the detection and identification
of SCs. This study revealed the current and trends of SC use in the
Jordanian illicit substance market, which was previously unclear.
Future studies are required to explore new SCs and their influence
in different biological samples.

Introduction
Synthetic cannabinoids
(SCs) are a class of designed drugs that
simulate the effects of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol;
the active substance in cannabis. SCs differ structurally from natural
cannabis, but they affect and bind to the same cannabinoid receptors
(CB1 and CB2) as the latter.1,2 Hundreds
of SCs were initially developed for research purposes on the endocannabinoid
systems and to investigate their possible therapeutic effects.3,4 Both of these G-protein coupled receptors have orthosteric and allosteric
sites where ligand can bind to enhance or inhibit their activation.5 Activation of CB1 receptors generally
reduces or inhibits the neuronal release of γ-aminobutyric acid
(GABA) and glutamate.6,7 GABA is the most prevalent inhibitory
neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, whereas glutamate
is a major neurotransmitter utilized in most of the brain’s
fast excitatory synapses.6 Sixty different
SCs were reported by UN member states, whereas most of them belong
to the John W. Huffman (JWH) class (JWH-018, JWH-250, JWH-073).8 Among them, AB-FUBINACA (N-(1-amino-3-methyl-1-oxobutan-2-yl)-1-(4-fluorobenzyl)-H-indazole-3-carboxamide) is a synthetic indazole cannabinoid
drug that contains a substituted indazole core.9 AB-FUBINACA was originally developed by Pfizer in 2009
as an analgesic medication.9 In addition,
AB-CHMINACA (N-(1-amino-3-methyl-1-oxobutan-2-yl)-1-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide) is a cannabinoid receptor modulator
synthesized by Pfizer for its potential therapeutic use.9 XLR-11 ((1-(5-fluoropentyl)-1H-indol-3-yl)(2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclopropyl)methanone) is a nonclassical
SC introduced to the drug market as a CB2 receptor ligand
that plays an important role in pain relief.10,11 Recent studies reported the association of acute kidney injury after
XLR exposure.12,13 Unlike cannabis, the chronic
abuse of SCs has been associated with multiple deaths, more dangerous
side effects, and toxicity in general.

To focus on the content
of herbal blends that were mixed or sprayed
with SCs because the vast majority of these blends are hypothesized
to be impure due to the addition of potentially toxic materials or
poor manufacturing.14 This work was conducted
to identify the presence of three common SCs (AB-FUBINACA, AB-CHMINACA,
and XLR-11) and measure their concentrations in the obtained seized
samples by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS)
method that provides a high level of selectively and sensitivity.
In addition, this study may provide a preliminary database that could
be utilized for comparative purposes of seized materials from the
Jordanian Anti-Narcotics Department of Public Security with other
available databases.

Results
Sensitivity of the GC–MS
instrument was daily optimized
on perfluorotributylamine according to the instrument manual recommendations.
The validation method was modified from the United Nations Office
on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) method,15 by
changing the preparation procedures and program temperatures and avoiding
derivatization. Linear calibration curves (Figure 1) and linear regression equations with excellent
correlation coefficients near 0.999 were obtained for all drug standards
(Table 1). The results
indicated a good linear proportionality between concentration and
response of drug standards (Figure 1 and Table 1).

Figure 1 Linear calibration curves represent regression line linearity equation
of AB-FUBINACA (a), AB-CHMINACA (b), and XLR-11 (c) between the GC–MS
concentration (X-axis) and response (Y-axis) of drugs standards.

Our
samples were recently seized by the Anti-Narcotics Department
on suspicion for containing cannabis-like substance. These products
primarily appear in three forms: dried leaves, cigarettes, and powder
(Figure 2). The targeted
SCs; AB-CHMINACA, AB-FUBINACA, and XLR-11; are characterized by major
ions (m/z), molecular weight, retention
time (RT), and molecular formula in Table 2. Quantitation was performed for the three
most common SCs in Jordanian markets. Detected concentrations of the
same SC were varied greatly among the samples. The active AB-FUBINACA
was quantified with a RT of 16.00 min (Figure 3). AB-FUBINACA was revealed in the 100 seized
samples but could be quantified only in 27 samples with different
concentrations, where the highest concentration was 0.11808 mg/g and
the lowest concentration was 0.0015 mg/g (Table 3, Figures 4 and 5, respectively). Ninety-nine
samples were found to contain AB-CHMINACA at a RT near to 17.00 min
(Figure 6) with the
highest concentration of 0.03721 mg/g, whereas the quantitation was
applicable in five samples only (Figure 7). The lowest concentration of AB-CHMINACA
was revealed in sample number 41 (0.00065 mg/g) (Figure 8 and Table 3). Although a suitable column and carrier
gas parameters were selected, there is a considerable increase in
background/baseline during analysis around 12–18 min RT in
the calibration curve of AB-CHMINACA (Figure 6). This limitation resulted from baseline
disturbance, which could affect the quantitation of AB-CHMINACA. XLR-11
was the least detected SC where it was found in 42 samples with a
RT of 14.00 min, but it was quantified only in 4 samples (Figure 9). The highest concentration
was 0.19238 mg/g in sample number 62 while the lowest one was found
in sample number 89 at 0.01789 mg/g (Figures 10 and 11, respectively,
and Table 3). In most
samples, the targeted SCs were either below the calibration curve
(BC) where the concentration could not be quantified or not detected
at all (reported as ND in the Table S1).

Discussion
The analytical procedure
was evaluated and proved to be applicable
for SC identification and quantitation. This method helped in avoiding
contaminations from derivatizing reagents because derivatization was
excluded. The obtained coefficients indicated the linearity of the
results, and an excellent correlation between concentration and response
for each drug standard was produced. Sensitivity and accuracy are
vital factors in drug profiling procedures because any variation in
chromatograms can affect the interpretation of the comparison process.
Therefore, the accuracy of the entire method was investigated by the
precision of RT where sensitivity was measured by the limit of detection
(LOD). The LOD was determined to be the lowest concentration yielding
an integrated height corresponding to three times the height measured
after injection of each drug standard.

The variability among
SCs in addition to their rapid structural
and appearance changes make it difficult to obtain a single extraction
and analytical technique for both identification and quantitation
of the newly introduced substances. The extraction procedures adopted
in this study were compatible and suitable for the quantitation of
the three targeted SCs in the seized samples. The use of this quantitation
technique allowed an accurate and rapid determination of the SCs.
Based on the GC–MS profiling, some identified chemicals represent
the natural composition of the tobacco plant, which is the only type
of dried leaf used as a medium for SC consumption.16 Most of the seized samples have more than one SC and the
reasons behind such observation can be attributed to the poor manufacturing
processes or it can also be attributed to dealers wanting to enhance
the impact of their mixtures by adding additional SCs.

Nowadays,
SCs are widely used and have become an alternative to
marijuana because they are mimicking the effect of its active compound:
tetrahydrocannabinol in herbal smoking blends.17,18 AB-FUBINACA is one of our targeted SCs that is commonly used by
the drug designers in herbal blends. Its concentration varied greatly
in 27 samples ranging from 0.00015 up to 0.11808 mg/g. Variation in
the concentrations of active SCs is common and it was reported in
the first, second, and third-generation cannabinoids where the variation
was reported to be up to sixfold in the studied brands.19−21 There are no or limited published studies investigating the directly
associated adverse effects of AB-FUBINACA, whereas several hospitalization
reports on its closely related structure, ADB-PINACA.22 ADB-PINACA, a structurally similar indazole carboxamide
of AB-FUBINACA, has been found to introduce vomiting, somnolence,
hyperkalemia, myocardial infarction, rhabdomyolysis, nausea, seizures,
hyperglycemia, tachycardia, and pneumonia following its intake in
several hospitalized cases.22 AB-CHMINACA
is another SC detected in the seized samples with a concentration
range of 0.00065–0.03721 mg/g. This synthetic compound has
first appeared in Germany in 2014.23 Different
concentrations of AB-CHMINACA and/or its metabolites were reported
and quantified in different blood, urine, and tissue samples in several
cases including fatal intoxication, diabetic ketoacidosis, suspected
impaired driving, acute delirium, and seizures.23−28 Symptoms of acute AB-CHMINACA intoxication were characterized by
seizures, delirium, hallucinations, tachycardia, altered mental status,
confusion, lack of coordination, and unintelligible speech.27,28 For XLR-11, the assessed quantities were varied greatly among the
samples with a minimal detected concentration of 0.01789–0.19238
mg/g. A recent study conducted on several compounds including XLR-11
revealed variation in both the ingredients and concentrations within
and among samples of 21 studied brands.20 XLR-11 was identified in herbal mixtures and considered among the
top 10 most frequently abused drug in the United States.29 XLR-11 and/or its metabolites were confirmed
to be associated with acute kidney injury in different cases in addition
to being a cause of death in postmortem cases.21 XLR-11 intake is represented by nausea, vomiting, elevated
serum creatinine, abdominal and back pain, anxiety, seizures, and
tachycardia, agitation, irritability, hypertension, and hallucinations.30,31 The amount of SCs in herbal products were recently increased with
more than one SCs identified in the product. Between 2011 and 2015,
narcotic cases assessed by the Council of Forensic Medicine in Turkey
reported that XLR-11, AB-FUBINACA, and AB-CHMINACA were present in
2.20, 4.94, and 6.95%, respectively, in herbal products.32 Data on SC containing herbal product in eight
samples analyzed by GC–MS revealed five different compounds
with total concentrations from 72 to 303 mg/g. Among those SCs, XLR-11
concentrations were 15 ± 22 and 15 ± 1 mg/g in two of the
samples.33 Dunne et al. quantified SC in
63 herbal blends using NMR showing variations depending on the active
cannabinoid type with concentrations from 13 to 84 mg/g including
AB-FUBINACA and AB-CHMINACA.17 In addition,
Fowler et al. measured concentrations from 1.5 to 119 mg/g in 12 products
with 50.6 and 118.6 mg/g for the XLR-11.34 Inhomogeneity in herbal mixtures investigated suggested a serious
risk for the consumer. XLR-11 was among the detected cannabinoids
with concentrations of 40, 39, and 42 mg/g in different herbal mixtures.20 Changes in both the quantity and the quality
of SCs in smoking blends may harmfully endanger the consumers where
it becomes difficult to estimate the appropriate dose of consumption
and the predictable associated symptoms that can dramatically differ.
According to an international monitoring study of new psychoactive
substances (NPS), SCs continue to account for the majority of NPS
followed by synthetic cathinones.35 The
Russian Federation Laboratory revealed over the past seven years that
there is an increase of nearly 130 times the volume of seizures of
synthetic substances in the country from 165 kg up to 22 tons.36 The Turkish National Police reported over 240
NPS including a large number of SCs that have been placed under national
control such as AB-CHMINACA, FUB-144, 5F-AMBICA, AM-6527, and various
JWH compounds.36 The new SC N-(1-amino-3,3-dimethyloxobutan-2-yl)-1-(cyclohexylmethyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide, also known as MAB-CHMINACA has
been scheduled as a controlled substance in the State of Louisiana
to avoid an imminent peril to public health, safety or welfare.36

Scientific examination evidence, forensic
data, and information
are necessary to generate an effective response to rapidly growing
synthetic drug markets and to complete the currently available international
synthetic drug monitoring mechanism.37 Early
warning advisory is recommended for enabling timely and comprehensive
sharing of exchanging information on the new psychological effects
of these illegal SCs as well as analytical methodologies and reference
documents with international and regional organizations that are concerned
with controlling drug trafficking.

Conclusions
This
study will help in the development of SC library related to
the consumed materials in the Jordanian market for a better understanding
and trafficking. In addition, a validated method was developed for
the identification and quantitation of SCs in seized samples that
proved to be sensitive, precise, accurate, and linear. For prevention
and protection, it could be very useful to conducting researches on
the toxicological effects of these illegal synthetic compounds in
obtained urine and blood samples in the upcoming studies.

Materials and
Methods
Chemicals and Reagents
All reagents and solvents were
high performance liquid chromatography- or analytical-grade to get
high purity compared to MS solvent. Diphenylamine (DPA), dichloromethane
(CH2Cl2), water (H2O), and methanol
(CH3OH) were obtained from Merck (AnalaR, Merck BDH, Poole,
UK). Hydrochloric acid (HCl) and ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH 25%) were purchased from Fluka (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland). The
SC standards of AB-FUBINACA, AB-CHMINACA, and XLR-11 were adopted
from Cayman Chemical Company (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan).

Instrumentation
The experimental method was conducted
at the Jordanian Forensic Laboratory using an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph
system equipped with an Agilent 5977B mass selective detector where
data was processed on Agilent ChemStation software. Sample solutions
were quantitatively analyzed using the GC–MS in electron impact
mode with an Agilent HP capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.
and a 0.25 μm film thickness).38 The
initial column temperature was 240 °C (hold time 3 min), then
it increased gradually at a rate of 5 °C/min until it reaches
330 °C (hold time 23 min). The detector conditions included an
ion source temperature of 225 °C and a transfer line temperature
of 280 °C. The MS parameters instruct solvent delay for 3 min,
scan mode total ion scan, and scanning mass range 40–600 amu
at 2.17 scan/s.15,39

Sample Selection and Extraction
One hundred randomly
chosen samples of different herbal blends among samples seized in
the period between 2017 and 2018 were used in this study (Figure S1). Official approval was obtained from
Forensic Laboratory Directorate in Jordan (FLD) for the use of seized
materials supplied by the Anti-Narcotics Department of Public Security.

The extraction procedure was applied to the samples by adding methanol
that has the preferred requirements and recovery with the GC–MS
method to 100 mg of the seized materials (dried leaf or cigarette)
or 1–2 mg of the powder form. Mixtures were vortexed for 5
min and afterward centrifuged to isolate the organic layer which was
stored or directly injected into the GC–MS.1

Sample and Standard Preparation
The experimental procedures
applied in this thesis were adopted from a published manual of the
National Drug Analysis Laboratories.15

Internal Standard Preparation
DPA was used as an internal
standard (IS) to verify suitable method performance. Homogenization
was carried out using a 1000 mL volumetric flask where 100 mg of the
IS diluted with ethanol to give a concentration of 100 μg/mL
(100 ppm).15,40 This solution is prepared to
meet a good linear calibration curve and to dilute the standard stock
solution into different concentrations (1, 5, 10, 20, 100, and 200
ppm).

Reference Standard Preparation
Different concentrations
of the three reference standards including AB-FUBINACA, AB-CHMINACA,
and XLR-11 were prepared and used started with the lowest possible
detection limit of each standard. Standards were commercially available
at a concentration of 1000 ppm. For each standard, 1 mg was diluted
to a volume of 1 mL where it can be used directly or stored in the
refrigerator for at least one year.

Sample Solution Preparation
Using the electrical grinder,
200 mg of each sample was crushed into powder. The homogenized solution
was prepared by diluted each sample with the IS into a 100 mL volumetric
flask wherein 5 μL of each homogenized solution was injected
into the GC using an Agilent 7693 autosampler.

Method Validation
The GC–MS method of detection
in this study was slightly modified from the methods described by
the UNODC.15 The obtained seized samples
were processed by the liquid–liquid extraction procedure and
then chromatographed to determine which SCs match the selected standards
with a determined concentration. Validation of the quantitative and/or
qualitative analysis requires certain parameters including, selectivity,
the LOD, linearity, accuracy, and precision. The method was revalidated
to adopt the changes in preparation of the reference standards, preparation
of the IS and preparation of the samples, program temperatures, and
exclusion of the derivatization, whereas LOD were determined by S/N
(signal-to-noise) ratio > 3.
