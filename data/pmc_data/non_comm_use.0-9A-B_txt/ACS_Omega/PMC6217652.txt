Four
different novel magnetic core–shell nanocomposites
stabilized with Au/Pd nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by a simple
procedure and demonstrated their catalytic activity for effective
cleavage of pBR322 DNA. Initially, the Fe3O4–poly(styrene-divinylbenzene-vinylbenzyl chloride) (ST-DVB-VBC)
matrix functionalized with 3-aminobenzoic acid was prepared and grafted
with PPI-G(2) and PPI-G(3) dendrimers. Each core–shell matrix
was immobilized with AuNPs and PdNPs separately. The resulting composites
were characterized by FT-IR, UV–vis, SEM, TEM, XRD, VSM, XPS,
Raman, and TGA. The magnetic core–shell nanocomposites at concentrations
from 30 to 50 μM were employed separately to study DNA cleavage
by agarose gel electrophoresis. Among the four magnetic core–shell
nanocomposites, Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–AuNPs
showed higher activity than others for DNA cleavage, and formed Form-II
and -III DNA. When the concentration of Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–AuNPs was increased
from 40 to 45 and 45 to 50 μM, Form-III (linear) DNA was observed
with 10 and 22%, respectively, in addition to Form-II. This observation
suggests formation of linear DNA from the supercoiled DNA via nicked
DNA-intermediated consecutive cleaving process. The magnetic core–shell
nanocomposites were stable and monodispersed, and exhibited rapid
magnetic response. These properties are crucial for their application
in biomolecular separations and targeted drug-delivery in the future.

1 Introduction
Over
the last few decades, identification of small molecules capable
of cleaving DNA has attracted much interest owing to their application
in biotechnology, nanotechnology, and therapeutic studies. DNA is
an important drug target, and it regulates many biochemical processes
that occur in the cellular system. The different loci present in the
DNA are involved in various regulatory processes such as gene expression,
gene transcription, mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, and so forth.1 Many small molecules exert their anticancer activities
by binding with DNA, thereby altering its replication and inhibiting
the growth of tumor cells. The nucleic bases and deoxyribose sugar
moiety are not modified, and additional reagents are not necessary
when they are hydrolytically cleaved which allows the cleaved fragments
to be relegated enzymatically. DNA cleavage is important in gene therapy,
gene engineering, nucleic acid structure detection, and so forth.2−4 The synthesis of novel nucleases is an important aspect of biotechnology,
drug design5,6 and molecular biology.7 Synthetic nucleases with high efficiency and selectivity
are largely demanded, bcause DNA is sensitive to oxidative cleavage,
many studies have been focused on molecules capable of cleaving DNA
oxidatively.8 Such molecules induce oxidative
cleavage of DNA photolytically with redox cofactors, hydrogen peroxide,9 ascorbic acid,10 mercaptopropionic
acid,11 or potassium monopersulfate.12 These molecules bear some advantages over conventional
enzymatic nucleases because of the small size which facilitates accessibility
to even sterically hindered regions of a macromolecule.

Transition-metal
complexes have been extensively studied for their
nuclease-like activity using the redox properties of the metal and
dioxygen to produce reactive oxygen species to promote DNA cleavage.13 Therefore, designing new metal complexes which
are capable of cleaving DNA in aqueous medium has received considerable
attention. The hydrolytic cleavage of DNA finds use in the fields
of molecular biology and biotechnology.

The core–shell
composite materials are in the frontiers
of advanced research in which the core induces optical, catalytic,
and magnetic properties, and the shell the surface properties of the
particles. Various cores and diverse shells have been already exploited,
for example, various inorganic materials such as zirconium phosphate
sheets, silica, alumina, and various metal oxides are used as core
moiety, and dextran, chitosan, gelatin, poly(ethylene glycol), poly(d,l-lactide), poly(glycolide) and so forth are used
as shells.14,15 Generally, the shell protects
the core from oxidation, enhances its stability and compatibility,16 becomes a platform for surface functionalization,17 and provides a natural vehicle for obtaining
the hybrid-multifunctional materials.18 Over the past few years, Au nanoparticles (NPs) have been coated
on various magnetic core–shell nanocomposites such as Fe3O4–polymer@Au, γ-Fe2O3–polymer@Au. They have low reactivity, high chemical
stability, and biocompatibility. Recently, magnetic adsorbents such
as Fe3O4NPs and amidoxime-functionalized Fe3O4@SiO2NPs have been reported to remove
U(VI), WOX/C to remove Pb2+ and methylene blue, and Fe3O4/polydopamine hollow spheres to remove Eu(III)
ions.19−22 These magnetic core–shell nanocomposites have been used for
protein separation,23 catalysis,24 cell separation,25 drug delivery,26 detection,27 biological sensing, and probing.28,29

Polymers coated on magnetic NPs can prevent grain growth and
agglomeration,
and facilitate binding of other NPs.30 Polymer
coating has an additional advantage of providing functionality. Similarly,
it is our expectation that the effective dispersability of core–shell
Fe3O4–polymer in organic/aqueous phases
would provide plenty of biological and catalytic applications. Hence,
researchers have strived their efforts to develop core–shell
magnetic nanocomposites which have the properties of more stability
and effective dispersability in organic/aqueous phase without losing
the magnetic saturation property. Further, to enhance the stability
and dispersability of magnetic nanocomposite, it is essential to identify
the relevant functional polymer coated with Fe3O4 NPs and the relevant shell or functional polymer. More specifically,
dendrimers grown onto the solid matrix including poly(styrene) bead,31 magnetic NPs,32 carbon
black,33 and silica34 have been the recently reported techniques for the design
of innovative dendritic-based catalysts. Dendrimers are an attractive
symmetrical supramolecules having excellent efficiency to generate
metal NPs via encapsulation and stabilization processes. The salient
merits of these dendrimer-supported catalysts include easy recovery
and recycling and easy handling of odorous and toxic substances.35

Gold and platinum metal NPs were studied
for DNA degradation.36,37 Midander and co-workers studied
single-stranded breakage in the
cultured human lung cells with CuNPs.38 CuNPs are potent cytotoxic and genotoxic and exhibit toxicological
activities in vivo39 and in cultured cancer
cell lines.40 The application of metal
NPs in DNA cleavage leads to provide an advantage such as generation
of singlet oxygen species.41,42 Recently, Geddes and
co-workers have demonstrated enhancement of singlet oxygen generation
using metal NPs.43 Metal NPs in conjunction
with photosensitizers can also enhance singlet oxygen generation.44 Although a number of copper(II) complexes exhibited
DNA degradation,45 use of magnetic core–shell
nanocomposites containing dendrimer-stabilized gold NPs (AuNPs) and
palladium NPs (PdNPs) as singlet oxygen generators were reported in
the literature to the best of our knowledge. It is in this background,
we described a novel experimental strategy for synthesis of core–shell
magnetic nanocomposites via integration of magnetic NPs, polymers,
and 3-D dendrimers. In the present study, we report the synthesis
of new magnetic core–shell nanocomposites using Fe3O4–poly(styrene-divinylbenzene-vinylbenzyl chloride)
(ST-DVB-VBC) matrix grafted with PPI-G(2) and PPI-(G3) dendrimers,
and these two matrices in turn were used to stabilize AuNPs and PdNPs
to form four types of magnetic core–shell nanocomposites. These
magnetic core–shell nanocomposites were then examined for nuclease
activities with pBR322 DNA by gel electrophoresis technique.

2 Results and Discussions
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
of Magnetic
Core–Shell Nanocomposites Fe3O4–Poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPIG(2)/PPI(G3)
Stabilized AuNPs and PdNPs
2.1.1 Characterization by Fourier
Transform Infrared
(FT-IR) Spectroscopy
In Figure 1a, the FT-IR spectrum of Fe3O4NPs showed a characteristic absorption peak at 589 cm–1 due to magnetic Fe3O4 NPs.
The FT-IR spectrum of OA–Fe3O4NPs (Figure 1b) showed peaks at
1610, 1660, 2853 and 2924, and 3446 cm–1, and they
are assigned to C=C, C=O, −CH3 and
−CH2, and OH groups, respectively. Therefore, oleic
acid caps Fe3O4NPs. The magnetic Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC) nanocomposite was prepared
by suspension polymerization technique: OA–Fe3O4NPs were coated with poly(styrene) copolymer formed by copolymerization
of styrene (ST), VBC, and DVB. In Figure 1c, the FT-IR spectrum of Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC) showed peaks due to C=O at
1728, C=C of benzene at 1603, C–O–C at 1269 and
1147, and C–H at 2924 cm–1. It confirms formation
of Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC). It was again
functionalized with 3-aminobenzoic acid. The functionalization was
confirmed by its FT-IR spectrum in comparison with the FT-IR spectrum
of Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC) (control) (Figure 1c,d). The peaks at
1664 cm–1 due to C=O (COOH) and at 3425 cm–1 due to −OH (COOH) confirm functionalization
with 3-aminobenzoic acid. In addition, the intensity of the peak due
to C–Cl stretching at 698 cm–1 in Figure 1c significantly reduced
confirming nucleophilic substitution on it with 3-aminobenzoic acid.

Figure 1 FT–IR
spectra of (a) Fe3O4, (b) Fe3O4–OA, (c) Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC),
(d) Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–COOH,
(e) Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2),
and (f) Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3).

Further, the separate grafting
of dendrimers, PPI-G(2), and PPI-G(3)
onto the Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–COOH
matrix was also established by their FT-IR spectra. Comparison of
the FT-IR spectra of Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)
(Figure 1e) and Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVBVBC)–PPI-G(3) (Figure 1f) with that of Figure 1d reveals that the
characteristic peak due to C=O group, observed at 1738 cm–1 in Figure 1d, is shifted to 1645 cm–1 in Figure 1e,f. It confirms the formation
a −CONH– linkage. The appearance of −CONH–
groups confirms the grafting of PPI-G(2) and PPI-G(3) dendrimers on
the respective matrix. The FT-IR spectra derived from all of the catalysts
(Figure S1a-d) reveal the peak due to −NH2 between 3000 and 3200 cm–1 (Figure 1e,f) completely disappeared,
confirming stabilization PdNPs and AuNPs.

2.1.2 Characterization
by UV–Visible Spectroscopy
The immobilization of PdNPs
and AuNPs onto the Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)
and −PPI-G(3)
nanocomposites is established through UV–vis spectroscopy.
Two types of Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)
and −PPI-G(3), separately dispersed in ethanol was treated
with a solution of K2PdCl4 in water. The magnetic
NPs became brownish yellow, thus confirming bonding of Pd2+ with the composite. The composites were then converted into Pd0NPs by slow addition of NaBH4 solution. The brown
color was changed to dark brown, confirming immobilization of PdNPs
onto the respective composite. To establish the immobilization of
PdNPs, the composites were dispersed separately in ethanol and characterized
by UV–vis spectroscopy. The surface plasmon resonance band
was observed at 248 nm (λmax) for each solution (Figure S2a). Therefore, it confirms formation
of PdNPs in both the composites. Similarly, the formation of AuNPs
in Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVBVBC)–PPI-G(2)–AuNPs
and Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–AuNPs
was also confirmed by UV–vis spectral analysis. Both composites
gave surface plasmon resonance band with λmax at
545 nm (Figure S2b), thus confirming immobilization
of AuNPs in the composites.

2.1.3 Characterization
by Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
The SEM
and TEM images of Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–PdNPs
and −PPI-G(3)–PdNPs and Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–AuNPs,
and −PPI-G(3)–AuNPs are shown in Figure 2a–d. The SEM and TEM images showed
spherical particles with rough surface, and there were two layers:
OA–Fe3O4 forms the internal layer and
it is the core of the composite, and poly(ST-DVB-VBC) grafted with
PPI-G(2) and G(3) dendrimers form the external layer, called shell.
The thickness of the shell increased with the increase in the generation
number of PPI dendrimer which in turn led to stabilize more number
of AuNPs and PdNPs. It was observed maintaining of the spherical shape
of the first level matrix viz., OA–Fe3O4 even after the multistep synthesis and metal NP formation.

images of (a,b) Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)/PPI-G(3)–PdNPs
and (c,d) Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)/PPI-G(3)–AuNPs.

2.1.4 Characterization
by X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
Studies
The XRD patterns of Fe3O4,
Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–PdNPs
and −PPI-G(3)–PdNPs and Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–AuNPs
and −PPI-G(3)–AuNPs are shown in Figure S3a–e. The bare Fe3O4 (Figure S3a) showed peaks at 30.1°, 35.5°,
43.2°, 57.1°, and 62.7° (2θ). They are due to
(2 2 0), (3 1 1), (4 0 0), (4 2 2), (5 1 1), and (4 4 0), respectively.
The diffraction patterns support the formation of cubic spinel phase.
The XRD patterns of all four magnetic core–shell nanocomposites
showed two reflections at 7–10° and 19–23°
(2θ). They are assigned to the polymeric network existing in
semicrystalline form. The Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–PdNPs
(Figure S3b) and Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–PdNPs (Figure S3c) core–shell nanocomposites
showed three reflections due to (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0). The
reflections reveal that PdNPs have face-centered cubic symmetry. Similarly
both Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–AuNPs
(Figure S3d) and Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–AuNPs (Figure S3e) also showed similar reflections at
38.1°, 44.3°, and 64.4° (2θ) due to (1 1 1),
(2 0 0), and (2 2 0). Hence, AuNPs also have a face-centered cubic
symmetry. The average crystal size of AuNPs and PdNPs was calculated
by substituting the respective 2θ values of the reflection of
(1 1 1) into the Scherrer equation, and it was equal to 14 and 9 nm
for PdNPs present in Fe3O4–poly(STDVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–PdNPs
and Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–PdNPs,
respectively. Similarly, the size of the AuNPs in Fe3O4–poly(STDVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–AuNPs and Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–AuNPs
was calculated, and it was equal to 5 and 3.8 nm, respectively. The
formation of such low-size AuNPs and PdNPs on Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3) is due to the influence
of higher generation PPI-G(3) dendrimer templates grafted onto the
Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVBVBC) nanocomposite.

2.1.5 Characterization by Vibrating Sample Magnetometer
(VSM)
The magnetic properties of Fe3O4, OA–Fe3O4, Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–PdNPs and −PPI-G(3)–PdNPs
and Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–AuNPs
and −PPI-G(3)–AuNPs were determined by VSM, and the
corresponding M–H curves
are depicted in Figure 3a–f. The saturation magnetization (Ms) was equal to 72.7 and 64.92 emu/g for Fe3O4NPs and OA–Fe3O4, respectively,
43.72 and 28.06 for Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)
and −PPI-G(3)–PdNPs, respectively, 39.07 and 24.39 emu/g
for Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)
and −PPI-G(3)–AuNPs, respectively. A comparison of VSM
curves reveals that the Ms values of Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–PdNPs
and Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVBVBC)–PPI-G(3)–AuNPs
are lower than that of the respective magnetic nanocomposites derived
from lower generation number (PPI-G(2)) matrix, Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–PdNPs and
Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–AuNPs.
It is due to Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC) matrix
grafted with PPI-G(3) dendrimer containing large number of −NH2 groups and adding much organic load to the shell. The formation
of such a thick shell around Fe3O4 can reduce
magnetic attraction on the outer layer. Similarly, the decreased Ms value for Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)-AuNPs
and −PPI-(G3)–AuNPs compared to Fe3O4–poly(STDVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–PdNPs and −PPI-G(3)–PdNPs
is due to oxidation of the PdNPs more easily than AuNPs because of
their lower reduction potential. Hence, the magnetic core–shell
nanocomposites containing gold may provide a shell with thick wall
compared to that of the core–shell matrix nanocomposites
containing PdNPs. Therefore, the AuNP composite gives lower Ms value than the PdNP composite. The percentage
of Fe3O4NPs of each composite was calculated
using the Ms value of bare-Fe3O4NPs, and it was equal to about 89.29% in the OA–Fe3O4, 60.14 and 38.6% for Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–PdNPs and −PPI-G(3)–PdNPs,
respectively, and 53.7 and 33.5% for Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVBVBC)–PPI-G(2)–AuNPs
and −PPI-G(3)–AuNPs nanocomposites, respectively. Because
the percentage of the Fe3O4 content was calculated
from the Ms value, whatever explanation
offered earlier regarding magnetic impact with respect to Ms value goes well with the present values of
the percentage of Fe3O4.

and (c,d) Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)/PPI-G(3)–AuNPs.

2.1.6 X-ray
Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) Analysis
It was carried
out to verify the oxidation state of the iron in
iron oxide, and immobilization of AuNPs and PdNPs onto the four magnetic
core–shell nanocomposites. The XPS spectra of Fe3O4–poly(STDVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–PdNPs
and Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–AuNPs
are shown in Figure 4a,b, respectively. The XPS spectrum of Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–PdNPs showed the
peaks due to Fe2+ (Fe 2p3/2) and Fe3+ (Fe 2p1/2) at the binding energies of 712.4 and 725.6
eV, respectively. Figure 4a shows the appearance of two peaks for Pd at the binding
energy of 335.5 (3d5/2) and 341.4 eV (3d3/2).
The decreased binding energy is due to the interaction between the
nitrogen atoms of the PPI dendrimer with PdNPs. Further, the grafting
of PPI dendrimer onto the Fe3O4–polymer
nanocomposite is confirmed by the appearance of N(1s) peak at
the binding energy of 402.3 eV. All of the above observations confirm
the core, Fe3O4, existing in Fe2+ and Fe3+ states. The grafting of PPI-G(3) dendrimer is
confirmed based on the appearance of nitrogen peak. The appearance
of 3d level peaks for Pd and 4f level peaks for Au confirms immobilization
in Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–PdNPs
and Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–AuNPs
core–shell composites, respectively. Similarly, the XPS spectrum
of Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–AuNPs
(Figure 4b) showed
C(1s) signal at 284.70 eV, Fe2+ (Fe 2p3/2) and
Fe3+ (Fe 2p1/2) at 714.2 and 724.5 eV, respectively.
The binding energies are in agreement with the reported values.46 Similarly, the grafting of PPI-G(3) and immobilization
of AuNPs are confirmed by the characteristic peaks of N(1s), O(1s),
C(1s), and Au(4f) levels at 401.2, 530.94, 287.7, 82.8, and 86.6 eV,
respectively.

and (b) Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–AuNPs.

2.1.7 Characterization
by Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy is an important
tool to distinguish iron oxides
in different structural phases. The Raman spectra of the four nanocomposites
are shown in Figure S4a–d. The Fe3O4 core showed a broad and intense peak for magnetite
at 662 cm–1. It is due to the symmetric stretch
of Fe–O bonds (A1g). In contrast, the Raman spectra
of the four core–shell Fe3O4–polymer
nanocomposites (Figure S4a–d) yielded
an intense peak due to T2g(2) mode at 545 cm–1. The appearance of T2g(2) mode is obviously due to the
laser irradiation (1.95 mW), which transforms magnetite nanocrystals
partially into hematite or maghemite nanocrystals because of meta
stability of magnetite. A similar observation was also reported.47,48

2.1.8 Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
It is used to determine the weight percentage of Fe3O4 content in the four nanocomposites. The thermal behavior
of nanocomposites was examined from 30 to 600 °C. The TGA curves
for Fe3O4–poly(STDVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–AuNPs,
−PPI-G(3)–AuNPs, and Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–PdNPs
and −PPI-G(3)–PdNPs are shown in Figure S5a–d. The results showed a rapid weight loss
between 350 and 400 °C and above 480 °C. The loss in weight
occurred above 480 °C is attributed to degradation and desorption
of the polymer from the outer layer of the Fe3O4 core. The magnetite content in each nanocomposites was estimated
from the residual mass percentage, and it was equal to 42.2 and 8.6%
for Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–AuNPs
and −PPI-G(3)–AuNPs composites, respectively, and 43.1
and 9.4% for Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–PdNPs
and −PPI-G(3)–PdNPs composites, respectively.

2.1.9 Comparative Studies of Magnetic Core–Shell
Nanocomposites for DNA Cleavage Studies
The nanocomposites
were employed separately for cleavage of plasmid pBR322 DNA using
H2O2 as a free radical scavenger under similar
reaction condition. The cleavage of the supercoiled pBR322 plasmid
DNA was probed using agarose gel electrophoresis. A rapid migration
of supercoiled form (Form-I) was noticed. In general, if one strand
is cleaved, the supercoil will relax to produce a slower-moving nicked
circular form (Form-II). If both strands are cleaved, a linear form
(Form-III) will be generated that migrates between Form-I and Form-II.
In our case, irrespective of the core–shell nanocomposites,
the PdNPs and AuNPs reacted with H2O2 and produced •OH radicals and –OH ions. The •OH radicals then cleaved the pBR322 plasmid DNA. The
degree of DNA cleavage was quantitatively estimated from the results
of electrophoresis. Five different concentrations were fixed between
30 and 50 μM, and the DNA cleavage was studied. The DNA cleavage
pattern obtained for core–shell nanocomposites viz., Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–PdNPs,
−PPI-G(3)–PdNPs and Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–AuNPs,
−PPI-G(3)–AuNPs are shown in Figure 5a–d, and the corresponding bar diagrams
are shown in Figure 6a–d. The DNA cleavage pattern and their bar diagrams showed
an increase in the efficiency of DNA cleavage with an increase in
the concentration of the nanocomposite. As discussed above, the cleavage
of DNA occurred due to •OH radical generated in
the reaction mixture. The PdNPs/AuNPs immobilized in the nanocomposite
reacted with H2O2, and generated the •OH radicals and hydroxyl ions. The number of •OH
radicals generated in the reaction mixture depends on the amount of
H2O2 decomposed by PdNPs/AuNPs. In other words,
the more the number of PdNPs/AuNPs, the higher is the amount
of H2O2 decomposed, and the more the number
of •OH radicals formed, the higher is the
degree of cleavage of supercoiled plasmid DNA. The efficiency of DNA
cleavage was in the order Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–AuNPs
> Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–AuNPs
> Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–PdNPs
> Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–PdNPs.
Although equal amount of the precursors of PdNPs/AuNPs was added in
the preparation of all four magnetic core–shell nanocomposites,
the amount of PdNPs/AuNPs immobilized on composites derived from PPI-G(2)
matrices was less than that of PPI-G(3). It is due to less number
of −NH2 surface functional groups available in PPI-G(2).
Therefore, the amount of H2O2 decomposed to
generate •OH radicals was less. Therefore, the number
of DNA molecules cleaved was also less. Similarly, among four types
of nanocomposites, the Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–AuNPs
(50% of Form-II and 22% of Form-III) showed more active DNA cleavage
than Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–PdNPs
(45% of Form-II), Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–PdNPs
(62% of Form-II), and Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–AuNPs
(99% of Form-II). In the DNA cleavage studies, in the presence of
core shell composite, the Form-I DNA was cleaved into Form-II. The
percentage of Form-II is usually accounted to ascertain the performance
of the core–shell composite. In certain circumstances especially
in the presence of efficient core–shell composite, the Form-I
DNA directly gets cleaved and gives both Form-II and -III. This indicates
that a particular core–shell composite is extraordinarily accelerating
the DNA cleavage and producing both Form-II and -III. Hence, the Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–AuNPs
rapidly cleaved DNA and thus produced both Form-II and -III DNA. When
the concentration of the Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–AuNPs
was increased from 40 to 45 and then to 50 μM, Form-III DNA
was observed. This observation suggests that the linear DNA is formed
from the supercoiled DNA via nicked DNA-intermediated consecutive
cleaving process. This is because, the composites having PPI-G(3)
contain more number of −NH2 surface functional groups
than PPI-G(2). Therefore, the metal content of PPI-G(3) is higher
than PPI-G(2) grafted nanocomposites. The more number of PdNPs/AuNPs
available in PPI-G(3) nanocomposite increased DNA cleavage. Although
in Fe3O4–poly(STDVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–AuNPs
and Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–PdNPs,
same amount of Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)
matrix and PPI-G(3) were used as a common stabilizing agents, because
of high reduction potential of Au3+ to Au (+0.152 V), the
AuNPs were produced kinetically at a rapid rate and thus yielded smaller
size AuNPs (3.8 nm) with high surface area. However, in the case of
PdNPs formation, the standard reduction potential of Pd2+ to Pd is low (+0.915 V), and hence, the rate of growth of PdNPs
was lower than that of the AuNPs and hence yielded a larger size PdNPs
(9 nm) with low surface area for DNA cleavage. Therefore, it confirms
higher activity of Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB
VBC)–PPI-G(3)–AuNPs than Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–PdNPs.

3 Conclusions
We have developed four types of novel, magnetically recoverable
core–shell nanocomposites using Fe3O4 as a core and poly(MS-DVB-VBC) as a shell. The disappearance of
−NH2 peaks between 3000 and 3200 cm–1 in the FTIR spectra and appearance of SPR peak at 547 and 210 nm
in UV–vis spectra confirms the formation of AuNPs and PdNPs.
The SEM images showed smooth-to-rough surface with increased white
patches on PPI-G(3)-stabilized AuNPs/PdNPs. VSM studies revealed that
the percentage of Fe3O4NPs was equal to 95.5%
in OA–Fe3O4, 60.14 and 38.6% in Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–PdNPs
and −PPIG(3)–PdNPs, respectively, and 53.7 and 33.5%
in Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)-
AuNPs and −PPI-G(3)–AuNPs, respectively. The XPS results
showed all of the elements present in the core: the N(1s), O(1s),
C(1s), Fe2+ and Fe3+, and Au(4f) levels were
observed respectively at 401.2, 530.94, 287.7, 714.2 and 724.5, and
82.8 and 86.6 eV for Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–AuNPs.
Similarly, two peaks at 335.5 (3d5/2) and 341.4 eV (3d3/2) due to PdNPs were observed for Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–PdNPs. The integration
of Fe3O4, polystyrene, dendrimer, and Au/PdNPs
produced an efficient magnetic core–shell nanocomposite for
effective cleavage of DNA. The DNA cleavage was in the order Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–AuNPs
(100%) > Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–AuNPs
(99%) > Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI
G(3)–PdNPs (68%) > Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–PdNPs
(45%). In the case of Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–AuNPs
nanocomposite, there is co-existence of all three forms of DNA, suggesting
the formation of linear DNA from the supercoiled DNA via nicked DNA-intermediated
consecutive cleaving process. Although the same amount of Type-II
Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC) matrix and PPI-G(3)
was used as a stabilizing agent, because of high reduction potential
of Au3+ to Au (+0.152 V), the AuNPs was produced kinetically
at a rapid rate and thus yielded small size AuNPs (3.8 nm) with high
surface area for DNA cleavage compared with PdNPs with low reduction
potential (+0.915 V). Hence, it is worth to claim that the Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–AuNPs
is a new addition to the literature for effective cleavage of DNA.
These new magnetic nanocomposites could offer new approaches and opportunities
in chemistry, biology, and medicine in the future. Similar approaches
can be used for the development of certain new fluorescent-magnetic
nanocomposites with low toxicity. A significant part of the future
work in this area must be focused on the investigation of the toxicity
and improvement of biocompatibility of multimodal nanocomposites.

4 Experimental Methods
4.1 Synthesis of Fe3O4 Magnetic
NPs (Fe3O4NPs)
Fe3O4 magnetic particles (Fe3O4NPs) were
synthesized by modifying the reported procedure (Scheme 1) through the co-precipitation
method.49 The
dried magnetic Fe3O4NPs were characterized by
FT-IR (Figure 1a).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Fe3O4–Poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-(G2)–Pd/AuNPs
and Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-(G3)–Pd/AuNPs
4.2 Preparation
of Magnetic Fe3O4–Poly(ST-DVB-VBC) Nanocomposite
The Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC) polymer-coated
magnetic
nanocomposite was prepared by following the below mentioned procedure
(Scheme 1).

One
gram of OA–Fe3O4NPs dispersed in 50 mL
of ethanol in a 250 mL RB flask was ultrasonicated for 15 min at 3
eV output. Two grams of poly(ethylene glycol) dissolved in 10 mL of
hot water, 3 mL (0.007 mol) of ST, 3 mL of (0.007 mol) DVB, and 6
mL of (0.014 mol) VBC were mixed and stirred. Then, both the solutions
were transferred to the OA–Fe3O4NPs dispersion.
Benzoyl peroxide (0.4 g) dissolved in 2 mL of ethanol was added dropwise
under vigorous stirring using a mechanical stirrer. The mixture was
stirred at 80 °C for 4 h. The resulting nanocomposite was isolated
using a bar magnet and washed with water and ethanol. It was then
dried under vacuum for 24 h to obtain core–shell nanocomposite
Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC). It was characterized
by FT-IR and the spectrum is shown in Figure 1c.

4.3 Acid Functionalization
of Fe3O4–Poly(ST-DVB-VBC) Nanocomposite
In a 100 mL
RB flask, 1 g of the magnetic core–shell nanocomposite containing
the chloride groups, Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)
was dispersed in 20 mL of ethanol ultrasonication for 15 min (Scheme 1). 3-Aminobenzoic
acid (0.75 g) dissolved in 5 mL of ethanol was added to it, and the
reaction mixture was stirred mechanically for 2 h at 50 °C. The
resulting magnetic nanocomposite was centrifuged and the residue was washed
repeatedly with ethanol. Then, the magnetic nanocomposite was stirred
with 10% of KOH for 1 h, filtered and washed with water and finally
with water–ethanol mixture. It was then dried, and Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–COOH matrix was obtained.
The dried matrix was characterized by FT-IR (Figure 1d). This magnetic core–shell nanocomposite
Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–COOH was
then used as a common matrix for grafting of stabilizing agents
such as PPI-G(2) and PPI-G(3) dendrimers.

4.4 Grafting
of PPI-(G2) and PPI-(G3) Dendrimers
onto the Fe3O4–Poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–COOH
Matrix
The grafting of PPI (G2) dendrimer was performed by
the following procedure: in a 100 mL RB flask, 1 g of Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–COOH was dispersed in
10 mL of dimethylformamide by ultrasonication for 15 min (Scheme 1). PPI-G(2) (100
mg (0.1293 mmol)), 0.04 g (0.15 mmol) of dicyclohexyl carbodiimide,
and 0.02 g (0.15 mmol) of dry dimethylaminopyridine were added to
it. The reaction mixture was stirred for 72 h at ambient temperature
under nitrogen atmosphere, and the resulting product was filtered
and washed with hot chloroform, and the byproducts were removed. It
was dried under vacuum to obtain Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2).
In a similar manner, the PPIG(3) was grafted by taking equal amount
of reagent/solvent mentioned in the earlier procedure, and another
magnetic core–shell matrix Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)
was obtained. These two different magnetic core–shell nanocomposites
Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPIG(2)
and Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)
were characterized by FT-IR (Figure 1e,f).

4.5 Preparation of Magnetic
Core–Shell
Nanocomposites Fe3O4–Poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)/PPI-G(3)–PdNPs/AuNPs
The immobilization of PdNPs and AuNPs onto the magnetic core–shell
nanocomposite Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)
and Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)
were performed separately by taking 3.5 × 10–3 mmol of K2PdCl4 and HAuCl4 as metal
precursors. By using NaBH4 as a reducing agent the magnetic
core–shell nanocomposites were obtained (Scheme 1). Magnetic core–shell dendrimer matrices
(0.5 g) viz., Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)
and Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)
were taken separately in a 50 mL RB flask, and ultrasonication
was done for 15 min in 20 mL ethanol (Scheme 1). K2PdCl4 (1.5 mg
(3.5 × 10–3 mol)) in 5 mL of ethanol solution
was added to it slowly at room temperature, and then, the respective
reaction mixture was stirred with mechanical stirrer for 1 h. As a
result, the corresponding Fe3O4–polymer-coated
magnetic matrices changed from brownish yellow to dark brown. It indicates
the immobilization of Pd2+ in PPI-G(2) and PPI-G(3) dendrimer
grafted Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC) composite.
After 2 h, the respective Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)-PPI-G(2)
and Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)
complexed with Pd2+ was filtered and washed with water
and methanol until the supernatant was free of Pd2+ ions,
and then both the composites were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C
for 12 h. Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–Pd2+ and Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVBVBC)–PPI-G(3)–Pd2, taken separately in 50 mL RB flask, were reduced by
adding 2 mmol of freshly prepared aqueous NaBH4 (5 mL)
under vigorous stirring for about 2 h at room temperature. After the
reduction, the light yellowish brown color of the particles became
dark brown. The resulting magnetic nanocomposite was filtered and
washed repeatedly with water and ethanol. It was then dried under
vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h to obtain Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–PdNPs and Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–PdNPs.
Similarly, the nanocomposites containing AuNPs were prepared using
the same two matrices in presence of HAuCl4. To confirm
the immobilization of PdNPs/AuNPs onto the Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2) and Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3) magnetic nanocomposites,
they were characterized by FT-IR and UV–vis spectroscopy. The
spectra are shown in Figures S1 and S2.

4.6 Comparative Efficiency of Magnetic Core–Shell
Nanocomposites in DNA Cleavage Studies
The efficiency of
four types polymer-coated magnetic core–shell nanocomposites
viz., (i) Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–PdNPs,
(ii) Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–PdNPs,
(iii) Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–AuNPs,
and (iv) Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(3)–AuNPs
was studied separately in the cleavage of supercoiled pBR322 DNA through
agarose gel electrophoresis. The supercoiled pBR322 DNA (0.020 mg
mL–1) was taken separately in a test tube and mixed
with 50 mM solution of Tris-HCl/NaCl buffer (pH 7.2) and H2O2 (40 μL). Each magnetic core–shell nanocomposite
was added separately to it by fixing five different concentrations
from 30 to 50 μM, irrespective of the composite. All of the
samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C followed by their addition
to the loading buffer containing 25% bromo phenol blue, 0.25% xylene
cyanol, and 30% glycerol (3 mL). Finally, the respective mixture was
loaded on 0.8% agarose gel-containing ethidium bromide (1 mg mL–1) and then, the electrophoresis was carried out at
50 V for 1 h in TBE buffer (45 mM Tris, 45 mM H3BO3, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.3). The bands observed for Fe3O4–poly(ST-DVB-VBC)–PPI-G(2)–PdNPs/AuNPs
and PPI-G(3)–PdNPs/AuNPs when visualized with UV light were
photographed (Figure 5a–d).
