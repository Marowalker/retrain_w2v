A novel approach has been developed
for the synthesis of a wide
range of α-ketoacetals by the reaction of alkyl/aryl methyl
ketones and aliphatic alcohols in the presence of selenium dioxide
catalyzed by p-toluenesufonic acid. This method represents
a general route to obtain a wide variety of α-ketoacetals in
a simple, rapid, and practical manner. This approach is particularly
attractive because of the easy availability of the starting materials,
mild reaction temperature, and good yields of the products. The resulting
α-ketoacetals are of much synthetic value as organic intermediates.

==== Body
Introduction
The α-ketoacetals
are important functional moieties and are
useful building blocks in organic synthesis. They are useful intermediates
in that they provide an array of functional groups that are extremely
valuable in organic syntheses. For instance the α-ketoacetals
are a key intermediate in the synthesis of various biological active
compounds such as chiral α-hydroxy acetals,1 chiral α-amino acetals,2 chiral auxiliaries,3 and cyanosilylation4 and also for the construction of important heterocycles.5 Several methods have been described for the preparation
of α-ketoacetals.5−9 Goswami et al., reported the synthesis of aliphatic α-ketoacetals
starting from ketones via a two step procedure using SeO2.5a,5b Tiecco and co-workers reported the synthesis
of α-ketoacetals catalyzed by diphenyldiselenide and an excess
of ammonium peroxydisulfate under reflux conditions (Scheme 1a).7 Ayala-Mata and group employed Weinreb amides as a starting material
for the synthesis of α-ketoacetals (Scheme 1b).8 More recently,
we have reported the synthesis of phenylglyoxal diethylacetals via
the reaction of aromatic ketones with triethylorthoformate in the
presence of H2SeO3 catalyzed by BF3·Et2O (Scheme 1c).9 This method, though simple
is limited by the use of triethylorthoformate as the sole source of
alkoxide nucleophile. Generally, most of the other reported methods
involved multistep reactions. Besides, the high cost of the reagents
coupled with sensitive reaction conditions limit their scope of applications.
Development of an alternative method for the synthesis of α-ketoacetals
with wide substrate scope starting from simple and easily available
starting materials would therefore be a welcome addition to synthetic
organic chemists.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of α-Ketoacetals
The reactive behavior of SeO2 toward
organic substrates
in the presence of a Lewis acid or a strong organic acid, however,
has found few or no mention at all in the literature. Earlier we reported
an efficient regio-selective protocol for the C–C bond formation
by an unexpected α, α-diarylation of aromatic ketones
in the presence of selenium dioxide, catalyzed by boron trifluoride
etherate.10 This unusual reactivity of
SeO2 toward aromatic ketones in the presence of a Lewis
acid prompted us to explore its reactions with organic substrates
by varying the nature of the acid and the solvent used. Since then,
we have further demonstrated this unique reactivity of SeO2 with aromatic ketones by changing the acid catalyst and/or the solvent
used, leading to the formation of important organic intermediates.11

As part of our on-going investigation
on the synthetic utility
of selenium dioxide,9−11 we wish to report here an efficient general method
for the synthesis of α-ketoacetals from a wide range of ketones
and alcohols in presence of SeO2 catalyzed by p-toluenesufonic acid (PTSA) (Scheme 1).

Results and Discussion
Initially,
when a mixture of 1-(3-nitrophenyl)ethanone (1h) (1.0
mmol), ethanol (2a) (1 mL), SeO2 (0.5
equiv), and PTSA (0.5 equiv) was stirred at room temperature for 12
h, only a trace amount of the product was formed as observed by thin-layer
chromatography (TLC) (Table 1, entry 1). When the reaction temperature was raised to 60
°C for 8 h, the yield increased to 52% (Table 1, entry 2). Any further increase in the temperature
did not increase the yield any further. Further optimization reactions
by varying the number of equivalents of selenium dioxide and PTSA
(Table 1, entry 2–6)
were carried out. It was found that (0.7 equiv) of SeO2 and (1.0 equiv) of PTSA gave optimum yield of the product (85%)
(Table 1, entry 4).
To establish whether PTSA is unique to this reaction, other organic
acids such as TFA and CH3COOH were employed and in both
cases the desired product was not formed. It may be noted that the
use of either SeO2 or PTSA alone failed to give the desired
product.

With the optimized conditions in hand, the scope and generality
of the reaction of aryl methyl ketones with alcohols were investigated.
First, the reaction demonstrated a wide substrate scope in terms of
the aromatic ketone (1) with ethanol (2a) (Scheme 2). Aryl
methyl ketones bearing electron-neutral (4-H), electron-donating [e.g.,
4-Me, 4-OH, 4-OMe, and 3,4-(OMe)2] or electron-withdrawing
(e.g., 3-NO2 and 4-NO2) substituent in the ring
were successfully converted to the corresponding products 3a–b, 3e–f, and 3g–i in moderate-to-good
yields (59–90%). The procedure was also found to be compatible
with halogenated aryl methyl ketone (4-Br, 4-Cl), which gave the desired
products in good yields (3c, 71%; 3d, 74%).
The scope of the reaction was also extended to sterically hindered
2-acetyl naphthalene (1j), which readily yielded product 3j in 78% yield.

Scheme 2 Scope of Aryl Methyl Ketones That Couple
with Alcohols
Reaction conditions: ketones
(1) (1.0 mmol), alcohols (2) (1 mL), SeO2 (0.7 equiv), PTSA (1.0 equiv) at 60 °C, 8–12
h.

Second, homologs of alcohol from the aliphatic
series (Scheme 2) were
randomly selected.
Both primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols easily undergo double
nucleophillic attack on the α-carbon atom of the ketone to give
the desired products 3k–w in moderate-to-good
yields (60–89%). Methanol (2b), 1-propanol (2c), 1-butanol (2d), 1-hexanol (2e), benzyl alcohol (2f), and iso-butanol (2g) readily reacted with aryl methyl ketones bearing electron-withdrawing
group (3-NO2), electron-donating groups [3,4-(OMe)2], and halogenated aryl methyl ketones (4-Br, 4-Cl) to give
the corresponding products 3k–p and 3s–t in moderate-to-good yields (60–88%). Ordinarily one would
have expected that long-chain aliphatic alcohol would not react because
of steric consideration. Surprisingly however, the reaction with cetyl
alcohol (2h) proceeded cleanly in 8h to give excellent
yields of the desired product (3v, 85%; 3w, 89%). Similarly, secondary alcohols such as iso-propanol (2i) and cyclohexanol (2j) also reacted smoothly
to give the corresponding products 3q–r and 3u in satisfactory yields (62–79%). However, tertiary
aliphatic alcohol (2k) failed to react evidently because
of the bulky nature of the substituent adjacent to the reacting nucleophile 3x.

The methodology was further extended to the reaction
of hetero-aryl
methyl ketones (4) with aliphatic alcohol (2) which effortlessly gave the desired products 5a–d in moderate-to-good yields (72–93%) (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Scope of Heteroaryl Methyl Ketones
That Couple with Alcohols
Reaction conditions:
ketones
(4) (1.0 mmol), alcohol (2) (1 mL), SeO2 (0.7 equiv), PTSA (1.0 equiv) at 60 °C, 8 h.

To further explore the efficacy of the method, reactions
of substituted
benzylidine acetones (6) with alcohols (2) were performed (Scheme 4). Benzylidine acetone bearing electron neutral (4-H), electron
donating (e.g., 4-Me and 4-OMe), electron withdrawing (4-NO2), or halogenated group (4-Br) all gave the expected products 7a–e in good yield (82–92%).

Scheme 4 Scope of α,
β-Unsaturated Ketones That Couple with Alcohols
Reaction conditions: ketones
(6) (1.0 mmol), alcohols (2) (1 mL), SeO2 (0.7 equiv), PTSA (1.0 equiv) at 60 °C, 6–8 h.

Having met with unprecedented success in the
above reactions, we
finally turned to the aliphatic ketones 8. We were delighted
to note that the method continues to hold good with representative
examples of cyclic and acyclic aliphatic ketones (Scheme 5). Reactions with aliphatic
ketones such as acetone (8a), ethyl methyl ketone (8b), and pentanone (8c) proceeded as expected
to give the corresponding products 9a–d in moderate
yield (62–70%). Reactions with branched aliphatic ketones such
as iso-butyl methyl ketone (8d) and iso-pentyl methyl
ketone (8e) also gave the desired products (9e, 69%; 9f, 67%) in good yields. Similarly, secondary
aliphatic ketones 3-methyl-2-butanone (8f) and the strained
cyclopropyl ketone (8g) afforded the desired products 9g and 9h in 65 and 73% yields respectively.

Scheme 5 Scope of Aliphatic Ketones That Couple with Alcohols
Reaction conditions: ketones
(8) (1.0 mmol), alcohol (2) (1 mL), SeO2 (0.7 equiv), PTSA (1.0 equiv), 40–60 °C, 5–8
h.

Previously, we had proposed the reactions
to proceed via the intermediate 10 (Scheme 6) where precipitation of elemental
selenium occurred. In the present
work, particularly, the precipitation of elemental selenium was clean
with no formation of colloidal Se. Although we have not succeeded
in isolating the intermediate 10 so far, evidently the
mechanism follows the same route as reported in our previous work
(Scheme 6).9,10,11c

Scheme 6 Plausible Mechanism
Conclusion
We
have developed a simple and efficient approach for the synthesis
of α-ketoacetals from aryl/alkyl methyl ketones with aliphatic
alcohols in the presence of selenium dioxide and PTSA. The methodology
further demonstrates its generality for a diversity-oriented synthesis
of novel α-ketoacetals library. The reactions exhibited wide
substrate tolerance in both the reactants. The easy availability of
the reactants used coupled with the simplicity of the reaction procedure
involved will certainly make this methodology a more attractive and
viable alternative.

Experimental Section
General Methods
All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
TCI Chemicals, and Alfa Aesar and were used without further purification
unless noted. Melting points were recorded by the open capillary tube
method and are uncorrected. IR spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer
Spectrum 400 FTIR instrument. 1H NMR and 13C
{1H} NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance II-400
spectrometer in CDCl3 with TMS as the internal standard.
Mass spectral data were obtained with a Waters UPLC-TQD mass spectrometer
(ESI-MS). Elemental analyses were carried out on PerkinElmer 2400
Series II. High-resolution mass spectra (ESI-HRMS) were recorded on
a MaXis (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) time of flight mass spectrometer.
All reactions were monitored by TLC using precoated aluminium sheets
(silica gel 60 F254 0.2 mm thickness). Column chromatography was carried
out on silica gel (100–200 mesh), and flash chromatography
was carried out on silica gel (230–400 mesh).

funnel, washed with conc. sodium bicarbonate solution (2 × 10
mL) followed by brine (2 × 10 mL). The organic layer was separated,
dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrated
in vacuo. The crude mass was purified by column chromatography using
