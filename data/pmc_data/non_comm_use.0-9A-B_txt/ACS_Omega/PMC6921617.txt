The fabrication of highly reliable and rugged fluidic
chips designed
for use in autonomous analyses for nutrient monitoring is described.
The chips are based on a two-layer configuration with the fluidic
channels produced in one layer using precision micromilling. The second
capping layer contains through holes for sample/standard and reagent
addition and waste removal post-analysis. Two optically clear polymethyl
methacrylate (PMMA) windows are integrated into the opaque PMMA chip,
orthogonal to a 22.5 mm-long section of the channel downstream from
a serpentine reagent and sample/standard mixing region. An LED source
is coupled into the channel through one of the windows, and the light
intensity is monitored with a photodiode located at the distal end
of the channel outside the second optically clear window. Efficient
coupling of the source through the channel to the detector is achieved
using custom-designed alignment units produced using 3D printing.
In contrast to fluidic chips produced using solvent adhesion, the
thermal-/pressure-bonded simplified method presented removes the need
for surface treatment. Optimization of the thermal/pressure conditions
leads to very strong adhesion between the PMMA layers, requiring forces
in the region of 2000 N to separate them, which is necessary for the
use in long-term deployments. Profilometry imaging shows minimal evidence
of channel distortion after bonding. Finally, we show the potential
of these techniques for environmental applications. The fluidic chips
were integrated into prototype nutrient analyzers that display no
evidence of leakage in extensive lab tests involving 2500 phosphate
measurements using the yellow (vanadomolybdophosphoric acid) method.
Similarly, excellent analytical performance (LOD is 0.09 μM)
is reported for a 28-day field trial comprising 188 in situ autonomous
phosphate measurements (564 measurements) in total including calibration.

1 Introduction
The ability to monitor
the chemical status of environmental waters
requires sensing devices that can function in a wide variety of deployment
scenarios, ranging from single-use disposable devices for on-the-spot
measurements, to much more sophisticated analyzer platforms that provide
continuous data from remote locations to databases.1−4 The ability to reliably fabricate
these microfluidic chips plays a critical role in an analyzer’s
performance and function. Recent advances in microfluidic platforms
have led to the to cost-effective detection of multiple analytes.5−7 Although these devices provide many advantages, they are limited
to either on-site detection or further analyses on return to the laboratory.
Producing an inexpensive analyzer platform that can be left in deployment
for several months unattended remains a significant challenge. Currently,
autonomous analyzers are typically deployed by specialists from environmental
agencies, the water industry, and university research teams due to
unit costs and the need for considerable background experience and
knowledge due to the complexity of these devices. The data generated
from autonomous analyzers is increasingly augmented by satellite remote
sensing data, opening the way toward much more comprehensive real-time
and historical (trending) information that can be visualized and modeled
via complex algorithms that feed into predictions of future water
status.8−10 Autonomous environmental analyzer platforms are expensive
to buy and to manage in deployments due to the often-hostile conditions
these devices experience when in use.11−13 The high cost of these
analyzers arises from the need to produce a device that incorporates
reagents, at least one standard for checking calibration, pumps, and
valves for flow control, waste storage, nonfouling sampling port,
fluidic system, selective detection, electronics for data acquisition
and wireless communications, and power source/management.14

Cost of ownership is primarily driven
by short service intervals,
the need for a specialist staff, maintenance/use of expensive facilities
and boats/ribs, and replacement of devices/parts/reagents. This used
model is obviously very expensive and has contributed to the slow
uptake of autonomous sensors for tracking water chemistry.15,16 The recent global nutrient challenge targeted a unit cost to buy
of $5000 or less, compared to the typical $20,000 or more for such
devices, as this lower price point would lead to a much larger uptake
by state agencies and industries.17,18 A key challenge
is to make every aspect of the device and the analytical method very
reliable in use, as failure of any single component renders the device
faulty and requires a service visit to repair or replace the device.
For the reagent-based colorimetric methods often used in these devices,
reagent stability and compatibility within the fluidic system must
be balanced with method sensitivity, as more stable reagents can provide
for longer service intervals and lower maintenance costs.19 Likewise, power supply and management strategy
must be considered, although major international research efforts
driven largely by the e-car industry will advance this technology
rapidly.20 In this paper, we focus on the
development and reliability of the fluidic chip, due to its critical
role in the autonomous platform operation. The proposed fabrication
method utlizes micromilling, providing a fast tunable means for prototyping
and testing various fluidic designs in small-scale batches during
optimization of the fluidic layout.21,22 Micromilling
enables the design to be produced directly in the polymer layer without
the need to reproduce expensive molds if design changes are required
between batches.23

Polymethyl methacrylate
(PMMA) is a useful material for producing
prototype fluidic chips due to its broad chemical compatibility, thermal
stability, and its availability in opaque and transparent forms.24 PMMA is compatible with a range of manufacturing
techniques, including direct machining or molding. Direct machining
techniques suitable for use include laser ablation and micromilling,
and applicable molding techniques include hot and cold embossing and
thermoforming.21,25 Micromachining provides the flexibility
to rapidly produce and test various modifications to the fluidic design
and thereby optimize the proposed method on-chip before moving to
a higher volume method such as injection molding for low-cost production
of the final chip design. In addition, opaque PMMA reduces the potential
impact of stray light on the colorimetric detection approach used
in this method.

In this paper, we present a simple method for
bonding a two-layer
PMMA chip that results in very strong adhesion between the PMMA layers.
The method removes the need for surface treatment with no evidence
of chip failure/leakage during lab and field trials.21 These chips improve the reliability of the system fluidics,
and in so doing, significantly enhance the overall platform ruggedness
and reliability during testing cycles and in real deployments.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Analytical Method
Colorimetric detection
of phosphate (PO43–) using the yellow
method (vanadomolybdophosphoric acid method) was chosen to evaluate
the performance of the chip, in view of the excellent reagent stability
of 12 months or more,23 and demonstrated
compatibility with microfluidic analyzers.26 The prototype analyzer used for testing and integration of the fluidic
chip housed the method reagent, calibration standards (0 μM/blank
and 50 μM PO43–), and sample taken
either from the environment during in situ field testing or from a
sampling tank during in-lab testing. Flow control was carried out
using an in-house-produced fluidic board comprising two 2/2 (hit and
hold) and two 3/2 (latching) solenoid valves and two piezo electric
pumps to deliver reagent and calibration standard/sample to the fluidic
chip in a 1:1 v/v ratio.

All reagents and standards were prepared
using ultrahigh purity (UHP) water (MilliQ, Millipore, Burlington,
MA, USA) and analytical grade chemicals (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA), as described previously.14 Briefly,
the yellow reagent was prepared by dissolving 0.351 g of ammonium
metavanadate (Sigma Aldrich) in ∼200 mL UHP water with an addition
of 95 mL concentrated hydrochloric acid (Sigma Aldrich). Following
this, 7.14 g of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate was added and the
resulting solution was made up to 1 L using UHP water. The phosphate
standards were prepared by dissolving 0.408 g potassium dihydrogen
phosphate (Sigma Aldrich) in UHP water in a 1 L volumetric flask to
make a 3 mM stock phosphate solution. This stock solution was further
diluted to make up the 50 μM high calibration standard used
within the prototype analyzer. The blank solution contained equal
volumes of yellow reagent and UHP. All reagent and standard solutions
were tested and validated against reference spectra obtained with
a Perkin Elmer L900 UV–Vis–NIR spectrometer (Perkin
Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) using a wavelength of 375 nm.

Figure 1 shows the
fluidic chip design and channel arrangement. It is a two-layer configuration
comprising a lower “channel” layer and an upper “capping”
layer. Fabrication of the two fluidic layers was carried out using
a series of manufacturing techniques, including laser ablation and
precision micromilling as illustrated in Figure 2. Plates of commercially available opaque
3 mm PMMA were initially cut to the dimensions of the micromill bed
(145 mm × 145 mm) using a CO2 laser cutter (Epilog
Zing 16). The features comprising the fluidic chip were micromilled
(Datron CAT3D-M6 micromill) into the opaque PMMA to create the two-layer
prototype design. This comprised ∼1 mm depth/width channels
milled in the channel layer and three through holes (⌀ 6.5
mm) in the capping layer. The three through holes were configured
to receive 6.5 mm threaded barbed liquid connectors used for connection
of tubing (1/16th in. internal diameter Tygon) between the fluidic
chip and the fluid board of the prototype analyzer. Two holes were
drilled into both layers of the chip to ensure precise alignment during
bonding of the chip. During use, the reagent and sample/calibrant
enter via the inputs (7, Figure 1), merge (1, Figure 1), and mix in the serpentine channel (2, Figure 1). The color developed via
the reagent and analyte reaction is measured by means of a LED and
photodiode arranged at opposite ends of a 22.5 mm optical detector
channel (4, Figure 1). Light is coupled into and out of the detector via transparent
PMMA windows (5, Figure 1). From the detection channel, the mixture is conveyed to the waste
outlet (8, Figure 1) via the outlet channel (3, Figure 1) for external storage.

and reagent inputs, (2) a serpentine mixing region for mixing of the

using heat and pressure with the aligned fluidic chip positioned between
two glass compression plates and a brass weight on top; and (4) barbed
liquid connectors are integrated and the fluidic chips are leak tested
prior to use.

2.2 Bonding Procedure
A simple bonding
method employing an external weight in combination with thermal and
vacuum conditions was used to effectively seal the two-layer fluidic
chip. Prior to bonding, the two layers were cleaned using an ultrasonic
bath to remove debris and residues left over from the micromilling
and swarf build-up within the channels or through holes of the chip.
Thermal/vacuum bonding of the two-layer PMMA chips was performed under
optimized conditions (see Table S1, Supporting
Information) using a vacuum oven (Gallenkamp vacuum oven) set at the
glass transition temperature of this particular PMMA (∼165
°C)27 and a vacuum of 200 mbar. A
220 g brass weight (A) was placed on top of two glass compression
plates (B) with the two aligned layers of the PMMA fluidic chip (C)
positioned between these plates (see Figure S1, Supporting Information). The optical windows clamped in place and
the adhesion of the two layers and optical windows occurs under these
conditions for a period of 20 min.

2.3 PMMA Fluidic Chip Characterization
Characterization was carried out to assess the reproducibility of
the fabricated fluidic chips using a series of techniques including
optical profilometry, stylus profilometry, and optical microscopy.
Inspection and visualization of micromilled channels was carried out
using a Keyence 3D microscope equipped with a composite 50–500×
lens. Depths and profile measurements were carried out using complimentary
profilometers, a Bruker DektakXT stylus profilometer and a Bruker
ContourGT optical profilometer. The stylus profilometry was carried
out at a range of 65.5 μm, tracking surface features with a
2.5 μm stylus tip. Both approaches were used to create surface
profiles of both fluidic layers at the same targeted areas, covering
the merging point, serpentine mixing region, waste outlet, and optical
channel (see Figure 3). These measurements were performed before and after thermal bonding
to assess the accuracy and precision of the fabrication techniques,
and the extent of any channel deformation associated with the thermal
bonding procedure.

Figure 3 Channel layout and target areas used for characterization
of the
channels in the channel layer of the fluidic chip. (1) Sample and
the reagent inlet where the sample and reagent merge after intake
onto the chip, (2) initial portion of the serpentine mixing region
where the sample and reagent mix on chip prior to measurement, (3)
waste outlet channel through which the sample and reagent are flushed
after analysis, and (4) optical channel for colorimetric detection
of the sample/reagent mixture. These regions are discussed further
(see Figure 7). The
red line in the waste outlet channel (3) is the location used to obtain
the section shown in Figure 6.

2.4 Chip Leak Testing
In order to optimize
bonding of the chip layers, temperature, vacuum, and time were varied
systematically (see Table S1, Supporting
Information). The so-produced chips were tested for leakage following
bonding and cooling prior to integration into the prototype analyzer.
A 60 mL syringe was used to pump UHP water through each chip for 1
h, refilling the syringe as needed. Flow rates of 3.0, 6.0, and 12.0
mL/min were applied while the chips were visually checked for any
signs of leakage throughout testing. Particular attention was paid
to potential failure points including seams, optical windows, and
fluidic connectors. In order to minimize potential distortion of the
fluidic channels, the selected conditions were the least extreme that
exhibited no evidence of leakage (temperature = 165 °C, oven
pressure = 200 mbar, time = 20 min). After this preliminary testing,
the fluidic chips were integrated into a prototype water nutrient
analyzer for further lab assessment and testing, during which the
reagent and sample were delivered to the fluidic chips at a flow rate
of 3.0 mL/min for 1 h, mimicking the operational flow rate of the
analyzer in field deployments. The analyzer was then setup to run
in fully autonomous mode for further in-lab and in situ field testing
(see Section 3).

2.5 Interlayer Tensile Strength Measurements
Quantitative measurements of fluidic chip interlayer bond strength
were carried out using a Zwick tensile strength test system. Figure S2 shows the experimental setup designed
to assess the strength of the chip layer bonding wherein each face
of the thermally bonded chip was fixed to an aluminum plate using
a two-part epoxy adhesive (araldite rapid). The aluminum plates were
attached to the instrument, and the force and the stress applied to
attempt to separate the fluidic layers was measured.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Chip Interlayer Bond Strength Analysis
Three methods were carried out to assess the fluidic chip bond strength
(see Figure 4 and Table 1).

Figure 4 Bond strength analysis
carried for methods. (1) Fluidic chip adhered
directly to metal plates using epoxy, failure was seen at the epoxy
interface; (2) fluidic chip with roughened surface adhered to metal
plates using epoxy, failure was seen at the epoxy interface; and (3)
fluidic chip with roughened surface adhered to the metal plate with
roughened and scored surface using epoxy, failure occurred at the
bond between the fluidic chip layers.

3.1.1 Method 1
The fluidic chips were
directly adhered to the aluminum base plates using a two-part epoxy.
During the testing of this method, forces in excess of 300 N were
applied. The fluidic chips failed at the interface between the epoxy
adhesive and the fluidic chip, not at the interface between the chip
layers. A number of epoxies (Araldite Instant, Standard and Rapid)
were tested using the above method, all giving similar results.

3.1.2 Method 2
Modification of the fluidic
chip surface was carried out by manually roughening the surface in
contact with the epoxy using a 1000 grit sandpaper, to further improve
adhesion of the epoxy adhesive between the chip and the metal support.
Bond strength testing was again carried out using greater forces in
excess of 1500 N. Once again, failure occurred at the epoxy interface
between the chip and the metal plate, not at the interface between
the chip layers.

3.1.3 Method 3
In addition to the chip
surface roughening as per method 2, the surface of the metal plate
was scored and roughened manually using a hand file to further increase
the strength of the bond between the epoxy, the metal plate, and the
fluidic chip. The tests were repeated for a further set of chips,
and under these conditions, the interlayer bond in the fluidic chips
failed at forces in the range 1878.88–2076.47 N, indicating
the high degree of interlayer adhesion generated by the simple bonding
process.

3.2 Post-Bonding Fluidic Chip Channel Characterization
The imprint of the lower fluidic layer channel layout appearing
in the upper layer shown in Figure 5 is an effect arising from the temperature and vacuum
conditions combined with the external weight used during the bonding
process. Sections across the channel and equivalent imprint locations
on the capping and channel layers (Figure 6) show that the capping
layer protrudes slightly into the channel (∼3.0 μm),
forming a very tight seal at the channel edges in the process.

layer and (C) top layer showing the channel layout imprinted on the
top layer; the Keyence microscope images the lower layer showing a

obtained using the Bruker ContourGT optical profilometer.

Figure 7 shows characterization carried out on the
target areas
(see Figure 3) of the
fluidic chip’s channel layer using optical profilometry (Bruker
ContourGT) and microscopic imaging (Keyence 3D microscope). Optical
profilometry was used to generate 3D maps of the surfaces from which
channel widths and depths could be measured before and after bonding
(see Figures S3 and S4, Supporting Information).

Figure 7 Optical
profile and microscope images of the channel layer before
and after bonding of the (1) merging point, (2) mixing channel, (3)
waste outlet, and (4) optical channel (see Figure 3)

Table 2 summarizes
typical measurements of average depth, average width, depth standard
deviation, and surface roughness (Sz). These techniques were used
to assess if residues or swarf build-up from the milling process could
be seen and to determine the extent of any channel deformation caused
by the layer bonding process. Table 2 before bonding shows low standard deviation for channel
depth at each of the target areas measured and low channel roughness.
These results show that micromilling is a suitable method of fabrication
and can produce accurate and precise channels in the PMMA chips at
the required dimensions with acceptable tolerances. Comparisons before
and after bonding show a small increase in channel width and decrease
in channel depth due to the impact of the weight and vacuum used during
the bonding method to ensure strong adhesion between the two PMMA
layers.

Figure 7 also shows
that after thermal bonding, the channels remained clear with no blockages
or damage occurring and the mill marks remain present on the surface
of the channels both before and after bonding (compare for example
the microscope images of the waste channel before and after bonding).
The inclusions at the interface between the layer after bonding are
most likely due to small amounts of air trapped during the bonding
process in this interfacial region. However, these do not give rise
to any leakages, apparently due to the formation of a tight seal between
the channel and the capping layer (Figure 6).

3.3 Fluidic Chip Characterization: Leak Testing
Leak testing showed no evidence of any leakages or failure points
from 10 replicate chips assessed at flow rates of 3.0, 6.0, and 12.0
mL/min over a period of 1 h. When integrated into the prototype analyzer,
no evidence of failure or leakage occurred over 1 h of testing using
a flow rate of 3.0 mL/min. The chips were further tested with the
analyzer running in a fully autonomous mode during which 2500 in-lab
phosphate measurements were taken using the yellow method without
chip failure (see ref (14)).

3.4 Performance of Fluidic Chip in the Prototype
Nutrient Analyzer
3.4.1 In-Laboratory Testing
In-lab testing
was carried out on the integrated fluidic chip on the prototype analyzer
using a series of phosphate calibration standards (0–25 μM
PO43–) that were autonomously loaded
onto the chip using the fluidic handling of the analyzer. Standards
of known concentration were measured optically on the chip using the
integrated 375 nm LED coupled with a photodiode-based detector, and
the results compared against a UV–vis spectrophotometer employing
the same method.

The fluidic chip had two inlets, the first
taking in the phosphate standard and the second taking in the yellow
reagent at a 1:1 v/v ratio of the sample to the reagent. As the two
solutions were pumped through the chip, mixing occurred within the
serpentine mixing region, see Figure 3. Once the chip had been fully filled and the reaction
mixture was present in the optical channel, pumping was paused for
20 min to allow the reaction to come to completion at room temperature.28 Optical measurements were then taken using the
LED and photodiode. Figure 8 and Table 3 present the linear calibrations generated and the analytical performance
summaries for the phosphate sample detection on chip versus the UV–vis
spectrometer.

Figure 8 Optical detection for phosphate (PO43–) using the yellow method comparing the prototype analyzer incorporating
the fluidic chip and the UV–vis spectrometer (375 nm).

mean (N = 90)	1.74	1.63	1.05	1.25	
Both methods have excellent linearity (0.9999 UV–vis
reference
method, 0.9999 prototype analyzer) as seen in Figure 8. The UV–vis reference method had
a mean %RSD of 1.74 and a mean %RE of 1.63 (N = 90),
compared to the prototype analyzer, which had a slightly better performance
with a mean %RSD of 1.05 and mean %RE of 1.25 (N =
90). The results summarized in Table 3 and shown in Figure 8 also show an increased sensitivity for the analyzer
(y = 0.043x) in comparison to the
UV–vis spectrometer (y = 0.026x). This can be accounted for by the longer
22.5 mm detector pathlength of the fluidic chip in comparison to the
10 mm cuvette used in the UV–vis spectrometer.

3.4.2 In Situ Field Testing
A further
field study was arranged to test the prototype analyzer, incorporating
the fluidic chip, under real deployment conditions. The analyzer was
deployed at the River Liffey, Co. Dublin (Figure 9), and its field performance assessed over
a period of 28 days (21/02/2018 to 20/03/2018). During this time the
analyzer functioned in a completely autonomous manner, obtaining and
analyzing samples, as well as performing 2-point calibrations between
each sample measurement.

Dublin, Ireland. (B) Picture of the prototype sensing platform deployment
at Liffey Deployment location, Co. Dublin, Ireland (coordinates 53.356246,
−6.360325999999986).

Throughout the period of the deployment, samples
were measured
every 3 h, comprising a total of 564 measurements, including the environmental
sample and internal sensor calibration measurements. Occasional grab
samples were taken to validate the analyzer performance via the UV–vis
lab-based reference method. The internal temperature of the analyzer
was also monitored, along with the external environmental temperature
and water level throughout the deployment, see Figure 10.

Figure 10 In situ environmental monitoring. (A) Water
Level (cm) from 21/02/2018
to 20/03/2018. (B) External and Internal Temperatures (°C) from
21/02/2018 to 11/03/2018.

The River Liffey is a dam controlled with regular
releases upstream
of the deployment site being carried out by the Electricity Supply
Board at Golden Falls and Leixlip. Figure 10A shows the environmental monitoring of
the river level using a depth gauge deployed alongside the analyzer.
During the 28-day deployment river levels ranged between 63 and 187
cm in depth. Dam releases can be seen during the period 25/02/19 to
02/03/18. Heavy snow fall occurred from 24/02/19, with a subsequent
melt beginning on 04/03/18. As a result, a rapid rise in the water
level was recorded (70 to 170 cm) before reaching a maximum level
of 187 cm on 11/03/18. The average water level was 115 cm during the
period of the deployment.

The prototype analyzer was insulated
to minimize heat loss and
to prevent internal freezing within the platform. Figure 10B shows the elevated temperature
internally versus external environmental temperatures measured due
to the insulation of the analyzer and small amounts of heat generated
internally by the electronics. The internal temperature dropped to
a low of 5.1 °C in comparison to a low of −4.8 °C
being recorded externally (night of 28/02/18). Due to this insulation,
the internal temperature changes are also dampened compared to the
more rapid external fluctuations (e.g., see the changes from 05/03/18).
From 27/03/18 to 03/03/18, a major subzero temperature event occurred
with the external temperature dropping to −5.0 °C and
thereafter rising rapidly to 11.7 °C. A series of much shorter
subzero sharp temperature drops can be seen at 24/02/18, 07/03/18,
and 09/03/18.

Figure 11 presents
the results of the 28-day deployment to track variations in phosphate
concentration during the deployment (grey squares), along with lab
validation measurements (red circles) and water level (blue line).
A total of 188 environmental phosphate measurements were recorded
over the 28-day deployment (i.e., 564 measurements in total including
two-point calibration), using the fluidic chip in the analyzer. During
the deployment, the phosphate water concentrations together with the
calibration data were transmitted to a cloud database for remote access.

a 28-day period.

There appears to be a general correlation between
the phosphate
concentration and the water level, which could in turn be linked to
wash out of nutrients from fields into the river. The effect of run-off
caused by the snow melt into the river from the surrounding area can
be seen through the increased water levels from 05/03/18, which is
coincident with the gradual increase in phosphate concentration. A
number of grab sample values correlate reasonably well with measured
levels recorded from the in situ analyzer. The maximum detected phosphate
(PO43–) level during this deployment
was 26.26 μM with an average of 13.0 μM detected over
the 28-day period.

During the deployment, the analyzer did not
generate valid sample
measurements during the period 01/03/2018 to 03/03/2018, highlighted
in red in Figure 11. This was due to a significant freezing event during which the external
sampling line froze at the intake point, preventing the prototype
analyzer from acquiring samples. However, despite this, the internal
functions were unaffected (reagents, pumps, electronics, power), and
the platform continued to perform valid calibrations and transmit
data. After 03/03/2018, the external sampling line thawed and recommenced,
acquiring samples as before, with no servicing or external intervention
needed.

4 Conclusions
A cost-effective simplified
reproducible methodology for combined
thermal and vacuum bonding has been realized for the fabrication of
fluidic chips for environmental applications. These manufactured fluidic
chips were characterized and performance-assessed through extensive
laboratory testing and autonomous in situ field trials in real-world
senarios. Careful optimization of temperature and pressure during
bonding of the two PMMA layers and optical window layers resulted
in a very strong adhesion between the layers with little or no evidence of distortion
to the fluidic channel or optical window with no observed leakage
or failures between batches. Once integrated into the prototype analyzer,
the analyzer produced accurate and reproducible optical measurements
for the detection of nutrients using colorimetric chemistries. The
fluidic chip design allows for sample and reagent intake, mixing,
and detection to be carried out on-chip. In field trials the protoype
analyzer incorporating one of these fluidic chips functioned successfully
over a 28-day period during which time it was exposed to subzero fluctuating
temperatures. The ruggedness and reliability of these fluidic chips
produced by the method reported have enhanced the functionality of
the prototype analyzer and in so doing, has significantly improved
the overall analyzers analytical performance, reliability, and ruggedness
in long-term field deployments. The simplified bonding method has
the potential to be transferred to varying fluidic designs ulilised
by research group and industries where the application utilizes higher
pressures.
