This
article describes a rare case of cluster core isomerism in
a large molecular organometallic nanocluster. In particular, two isomers
of the [HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]2– nanocluster, referred as TP-Pd9 and
Oh-Pd9, have been structurally characterized by single-crystal
X-ray crystallography as their [NMe3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·CH2Cl2 (ca. 1:1 TP-Pd9 and
Oh-Pd9 mixture), [NMe3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·2CH2Cl2 (mainly TP-Pd9),
[NEt3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·CH2Cl2 (mainly TP-Pd9), [MePPh3]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·2.5CH2Cl2 (mainly TP-Pd9), and [MePPh3]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38] (Oh-Pd9) salts. The cluster core of TP-Pd9 is a tricapped trigonal prism, whereas this is a tricapped
octahedron in Oh-Pd9. The presence in the solid state of
the Oh-Pd9 or TP-Pd9 isomers depends on the
cation employed and/or the number and type of co-crystallized solvent
molecules. Often, mixtures of the two isomers, within the same single
crystal or as mixtures of different crystals within the same crystallization
batch, are obtained. Structural isomerism in organometallic nanoclusters
is discussed and compared to that in Au–thiolate nanoclusters.

1 Introduction
Since
the publication of the total structure of Au102(p-MBA)44 (p-MBA = p-mercaptobenzoic acid),1 a renewed
interest for molecular metal nanoclusters arose, because of their
relevance to ultrasmall metal nanoparticles, nanochemistry, and nanosciences.2−12 Thus, the structures of several Au, Ag, Cu, and bimetallic nanoclusters
protected by thiolates, phosphines, selenolates, alkynyls, and other
ligands have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffractometry.13−19 The structures of these metal nanoclusters are dramatically influenced
by the surface ligands. As a consequence, examples of cluster core
isomerization phenomena induced by ligand substitution reactions have
been documented.2,20,21 Even more intriguing is the case of Au38(PET)24 (PET = phenylethanethiolate), for which two isomers differing in
the cluster core structure, i.e., Au38Q and Au38T, have been crystallographically characterized. Au38T is
less stable than Au38Q and is irreversibly converted into
Au38Q by heating in toluene at 50 °C. This is the
first and, at the moment, the only case of cluster core isomerism
structurally documented for gold nanoclusters.21−23

The study
of structural isomerism in metal nanoparticles by means
of single-crystal X-ray crystallography is a very exciting but difficult
task.23 Cluster core isomerism was documented
for the first time in organometallic clusters, that is, [Pt3(μ-PPh2)3Ph(PPh3)2].24−26 In the closed form, the Pt3 core of the
cluster is an equilateral triangle, whereas it is an isosceles triangle
with an elongated Pt–Pt contact in the open form. Interestingly,
the cluster core isomerism of [Pt3(μ-PPh2)3Ph(PPh3)2] was a reversible phenomenon
induced by the nature of the solvent and its co-crystallization effects.27,28 These results demonstrated for the first time that packing effects
may induce changes in the structure of the core of small clusters.
More recently, a peculiar case of cluster core isomerism, that is,
dynamic permutational isomerism, has been reported in the closocluster
[W2RhIr2(CO)9(η5-C5H5)2(η5-C5HMe4)].29 In this case,
the two isomers differ for the relative positions (equatorial/axial)
of the W and Ir atoms within the trigonal bipyramid structure of the
cluster. Moreover, a dynamic equilibrium between the two isomers is
present in solution, indicating that the cores of these clusters are
not rigid.

Is it possible to have a dynamic and reversible isomerization
of
the core of larger clusters? This question is rather intriguing and
related to the intimate rigid/deformable nature of the metal core
of clusters of increasing sizes. To address this question, we have
re-examined the structures of the [H3–nCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]n− (n = 0–3)
molecular nanoclusters.30 These species
may be reversibly interconverted by acid–base reactions, as
summarized in Scheme 1. Their molecular structures were originally determined as their
H3Co15Pd9C3(CO)38·2thf, [NEt4][H2Co15Pd9C3(CO)38]·0.5C6H14, [NMe3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·C6H14, and [NEt4]3[Co15Pd9C3(CO)38]·thf solids and
salts. All of these clusters are composed of an inner Pd9(μ3-CO)2 core decorated on its surface
by three square-pyramidal Co5C(CO)12 fragments.
The most significant difference among the four [H3–nCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]n− (n = 0–3) clusters consisted in the fact that their Pd9-kernel was a tricapped octahedron in H3Co15Pd9C3(CO)38 and [H2Co15Pd9C3(CO)38]− (Oh-Pd9 structure), whereas a distorted tricapped trigonal
prism (TP-Pd9 structure) was present in [HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]2– and [Co15Pd9C3(CO)38]3– (Figure 1). The results previously reported indicated that reversible
cluster core isomerism between the TP-Pd9 and Oh-Pd9 structures could be chemically induced by acid–base
reactions.

Scheme 1 Reversible Interconversion of the [H3–nCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]n− (n = 0–3)
Molecular Nanoclusters by Means of Acid–Base Reactions30
These results prompted us to prepare and structurally
characterize
the same [H3–nCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]n− (n = 0–3) anions with different cations
and co-crystallization solvents, to verify whether the different structures
adopted by the Pd9-kernel was an intrinsic property of
the differently charged anions (as originally speculated) or was due
to different effects, such as packing forces and crystallization conditions.
Surprisingly, we found that, at least for the dianion [HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]2–, both the TP-Pd9 and Oh-Pd9 structures may
be found in the solid state, depending on the counterion and/or co-crystallization
solvents. Moreover, in some cases, both the cluster core isomers may
be found in the same crystallization batch, as mixtures of different
crystals or within the same crystal, suggesting that both isomers
are present in solution or, at least, they are reciprocally interconverted
during crystallization. This represents a genuine case of cluster
core isomerism induced by packing forces in a larger molecular nanocluster.
As an additional bonus of this study, the molecular structures of
the new nanoclusters [Co8Pd4C2(CO)24]2– and [Co13Pd3C3(CO)29]− have been crystallographically
determined.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
The synthetic protocol
adopted in this work is very similar to that adopted and described
in our previous paper.30 The major variation
is represented by the exchange of the cation prior to the synthesis
of [HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]2– (Scheme 2). Thus, [NMe3(CH2Ph)]4[H2Co20Pd16C4(CO)48] was synthesized by reacting [NMe3(CH2Ph)]2[Co6C(CO)15] and Pd(Et2S)Cl2 in thf according to the literature procedure.31 After workup, [NMe3(CH2Ph)]4[H2Co20Pd16C4(CO)48] was extracted in dmf and the cation exchanged
by adding a saturated solution of [CAT]X (CAT = NMe3(CH2Ph), NBu4, NEt3(CH2Ph), and
MePPh3; X = Cl, Br) in H2O. The resulting [CAT]4[H2Co20Pd16C4(CO)48] was dissolved in acetone and treated with an excess of
HBF4·Et2O. Then, the solvent was removed
under reduced pressure and the residue dissolved in CH2Cl2, resulting in [CAT]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]. Slow diffusion of n-hexane on these solutions afforded crystals of [NMe3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·CH2Cl2, [NMe3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·2CH2Cl2, [NEt3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·CH2Cl2, [MePPh3]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·2.5CH2Cl2, and [MePPh3]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38] suitable for X-ray
diffractometry. All of these crystals contain the [HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]2– anion, whose structure was previously determined as its [NMe3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·C6H14 salt,
in which the Pd9 core adopted a tricapped trigonal prismatic
structure (TP-Pd9). The same TP-Pd9 structure
was found in the new [NMe3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·2CH2Cl2, [NEt3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·CH2Cl2, and [MePPh3]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·2.5CH2Cl2 salts, even if in some cases traces of the
Oh-Pd9 core isomer are present within the same crystals.
Conversely, in the [MePPh3]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38] salt, the Pd9 core of the cluster dianion adopts an octahedral structure (Oh-Pd9). Even more interestingly, a 1:1 mixture of the TP-Pd9 and Oh-Pd9 isomers of the [HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]2– anion
is present in the [NMe3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·CH2Cl2 salt. Moreover, often crystals containing different
structures are obtained within the same batch, as, for instance, [NMe3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·2CH2Cl2 (TP-Pd9) and [NMe3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·CH2Cl2 (Oh-Pd9 and TP-Pd9), or [MePPh3]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38] (Oh-Pd9) and [MePPh3]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·2.5CH2Cl2 (TP-Pd9).

Scheme 2 Synthetic Protocol Adopted in This Article
It must be remarked that, in the attempt to
isolate [NBu4]+ salts of [HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]2– in accord
with the same procedure,
crystals of [NBu4]2[Co8Pd4C2(CO)24] were obtained instead. This indicates
that the reaction of [NBu4]4[H2Co20Pd16C4(CO)48] with HBF4·Et2O, under the conditions described above,
has an outcome completely different compared to that of salts with
different cations. It is likely that this is due to solubility issues
of the starting clusters and reaction intermediates as a function
of the cation. Indeed, the [NBu4]+ salts of
anionic metal carbonyl clusters are usually far more soluble than
salts of the same cluster anions with other ammonium or phosphonium
cations.

[CAT]3[Co15Pd9C3(CO)38] was, then, obtained by reducing the amount
of HBF4·Et2O in the acetone solution employed
in the above-mentioned
synthetic protocol, or by treating the CH2Cl2 solution of [CAT]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38] with a strong base. Slow diffusion of n-hexane on these solutions afforded crystals of [NMe3(CH2Ph)]3[Co15Pd9C3(CO)38]·CH2Cl2 and [MePPh3]3[Co15Pd9C3(CO)38]·CH2Cl2. In these cases, the structures of the trianions were analogous
to that previously reported as the [NEt4]3[Co15Pd9C3(CO)38]·thf salt
(TP-Pd9).

Conversely, by adding further HBF4·Et2O to the CH2Cl2 solution
of [CAT]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38], the
species [CAT][H2Co15Pd9C3(CO)38] was formed as evidenced by IR spectroscopy. This,
in turn, was converted into H3Co15Pd9C3(CO)38 during crystallization in the presence
of an excess of HBF4·Et2O.30 In the attempt to obtain new crystal salts of [CAT][H2Co15Pd9C3(CO)38] and H3Co15Pd9C3(CO)38, the whole procedure was repeated several times by further
increasing the amount of the acid employed. Even if this was unsuccessful,
when a very large excess of HBF4·Et2O was
employed, a few crystals of the [NMe3(CH2Ph)][Co13Pd3C3(CO)29]·CH2Cl2 salt were obtained. These contain the new [Co13Pd3C3(CO)29]− cluster anion that, probably, is a decomposition product of [H3–nCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]n− (n = 0–3).

2.2 Molecular Structures of
the Two Isomers of
[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]2–
In this section, the structure of [HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]2– determined in the [NMe3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·CH2Cl2 (1), [NMe3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·2CH2Cl2 (2), [NEt3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·CH2Cl2 (3), [MePPh3]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·2.5CH2Cl2 (5), and [MePPh3]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38] (7) salts will be discussed (Figure 2). All of the data have been collected at
100 K to improve the quality of the structures and limit thermal motions.
For comparison, the diffraction data of [NEt3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·CH2Cl2 (4), [MePPh3]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·2.5CH2Cl2 (6),
and [MePPh3]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38] (8) have been collected
also at 293 K. Apart from the expected lower quality, no significant
differences appeared in comparing the structures determined at 293
and 100 K. This suggests the absence of dynamic phenomena within the
crystals. Thus, the following discussion will be based on the low-temperature
data.

(f) [MePPh3]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38] (7), Oh-Pd9 isomer. (Orange, Pd; blue, Co; red, O; gray, C). Side (left) and
top (right) views are given for each molecule.

As described in the Introduction,
the molecular
structure of [HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]2– may be described as composed of an
inner Pd9(μ3-CO)2 core decorated
on its surface by three Co5C(CO)12 fragments.
The most remarkable point is that the Pd9 core may adopt
a tricapped trigonal prismatic (TP-Pd9) or tricapped octahedral
(Oh-Pd9) structure in the different salts (Figure 3). In particular:(a) [NMe3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·CH2Cl2 (1) contains two
independent cluster anion molecules within the asymmetric unit of
the unit cell, one displaying a TP-Pd9 core and the other
an Oh-Pd9 core. Moreover, some crystallographic disorder
has been found in the metal core of the former molecule, which can
be better described as 91% TP-Pd9 and 9% Oh-Pd9.

(b) The Pd9 core of [NMe3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·2CH2Cl2 (2) adopts a TP-Pd9 structure, even
if some crystallographic disorder (<9%) is present.

(c) The Pd9 core of [NEt3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·CH2Cl2 (3) is again TP-Pd9 (94%), with a
minor contribution (6%) from an Oh-Pd9 structure.

(d) [MePPh3]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·2.5CH2Cl2 (5) displays
a TP-Pd9 core.

(e) [MePPh3]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38] (7) displays a perfectly ordered
Oh-Pd9 core.

(f) The previously reported [NMe3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·C6H14 salt
displayed a TP-Pd9 core.30

salts.
The structures in the same line have been found within the same crystal.
[NMe3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·CH2Cl2 (1): (a) Oh-Pd9 isomer (molecule
1), (b) TP-Pd9 isomer (91% of molecule 2), and (c) Oh-Pd9 isomer (9% of molecule 2). [NMe3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·2CH2Cl2 (2): (d)
TP-Pd9 isomer. [NEt3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·CH2Cl2 (3): (e) TP-Pd9 isomer (94%), (f) Oh-Pd9 isomer (6%). [MePPh3]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·2.5CH2Cl2 (5):
(g) TP-Pd9 isomer. [MePPh3]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38] (7): (h) Oh-Pd9 isomer.

We can remark the following points:(i) Within the same crystal structure
(1), an almost equimolar mixture of the two isomers is
present.

(ii) A small amount
of the Oh isomer (ca.
6%) is present in (3), which otherwise displays a TP
core (94%).

(iii) All of
the salts reported contain
the [NMe3(CH2Ph)]+, [NEt3(CH2Ph)]+, or [MePPh3]+ cations and have been crystallized from CH2Cl2/n-hexane. The different Oh/TP structures displayed
in the solid state by the [HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]2– anion seem to depend on the
cation as well as the number of co-crystallized solvent molecules.

(iv) Mixtures of crystals
of (1)/(2) and (5)/(7) are often
obtained in the same crystallization batches.

(v) In the case of the [MePPh3]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·xCH2Cl2 salts,
the cluster displays the TP-Pd9 structure when x = 2.5 (5), and the Oh-Pd9 structure
when x = 0 (7).

(vi) Similarly, for [NMe3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·solv, the TP-Pd9 structure is
displayed when solv = C6H14 or 2CH2Cl2 (2), whereas a 1:1 mixture of the TP-Pd9 and Oh-Pd9 structures is found when solv = CH2Cl2 (1).



The main bond distances of [HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]2– as found in the different
salts are listed in Table 1, whereas Table 2 reports the numbers of M–M bonds and CO ligands grouped by
categories for the same compounds. For the sake of completeness, analogous
data for the [Co15Pd9C3(CO)38]3– trianion are compiled in Tables S.1 and S.2 of the Supporting Information. It must
be remarked that the structure of the trianion has been determined
as the [NMe3(CH2Ph)]3[Co15Pd9C3(CO)38]·CH2Cl2 (two polymorphs: P1̅, 9; Pca21, 10) and
[MePPh3]3[Co15Pd9C3(CO)38]·CH2Cl2 (11) salts. [Co15Pd9C3(CO)38]3– displays in all of these salts
the same TP-Pd9 structure originally found in the [NEt4]3[Co15Pd9C3(CO)38]·thf salt,30 and,
thus, this structure will not be further discussed. In compiling Tables 1 and 2, the various contacts have been considered as bonds when
the interatomic distances were less than or equal to the sum of their
covalent radii with a 20% tolerance, that is, 3.02 Å (Co–Co),
3.18 Å (Co–Pd), 3.34 Å (Pd–Pd), 2.33 Å
(Co–C), and 2.48 Å (Pd–C).32

As a general comment, by considering
all of the data reported in Tables 1, 2, S.1 and S.2, as well as those
reported in the previous article for the different [H3–nCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]n− (n = 0–3) clusters,30 all of the
bonding parameters depend solely on the structure adopted by the Pd9 core (TP or Oh) and not on the overall charge of the clusters.
This is likely to be due to the fact that, in such large molecular
clusters, the anionic net negative charge is delocalized over the
entire molecule.

Regarding the Co–Ccarbide, Pd–Ccarbide, and Co–Co bonding contacts,
these are almost identical for
what concerns their number and distances in all of the compounds considered,
regardless of the structure adopted by the Pd9 core, the
charge of the cluster, the counterion, and co-crystallization solvent
molecules. The organometallic Co5C(CO)12 fragments
that decorate and stabilize the surface of such clusters retain the
same square-pyramidal structure in all of the species structurally
investigated, apart from some minor differences in the stereochemistry
of the CO ligands. Overall, each carbide atom is encapsulated within
an octahedral Co5PdC cage.

The Pd–Pd bonds
display similar average values in all of
the clusters, but systematically the clusters adopting an Oh-Pd9 structure show more Pd–Pd bonding contacts (20–21)
than those with a TP-Pd9 structure (18–19). We should
expect 21 Pd–Pd bonds for both regular tricapped TP-Pd9 and Oh-Pd9 structures. The latter ones indeed
always display almost regular structures and follow this rule. Conversely,
in the case of the clusters with a TP-Pd9 core, the structures
are distorted and the three capping Pd atoms usually form three and
not four Pd–Pd bonds.

The number of Co–Pd contacts
that can be considered as bonds
is always greater in the clusters with a Oh-Pd9 core (28–30
bonds considering also the structures previously reported) than those
with a TP-Pd9 core (23–26 bonds). At the same time,
the average Co–Pd bonding distances are greater in the Oh-Pd9 clusters than in the TP-Pd9 clusters. We can envision
some kind of compensation mechanism, in the sense that passing from
the Oh-Pd9 isomer to the TP-Pd9 isomer the number
of Co–Pd bonds is reduced but their strength (as indicated
by their average distances) is increased.

Idealized TP and Oh
structures differ by a 60° twist of two
opposite triangles about a 3-fold axis. The twist angle can be assumed
to be 0° for a regular TP and 60° for a regular Oh. By analyzing
all of the crystal structures reported in this article, it appears
that such twist angle is 12–14° for the clusters displaying
the TP-Pd9 structure and 61–64° for the Oh-Pd9 isomers, quite close to the idealized values. None of the
structures so far determined adopts a twist angle intermediate between
these two values. Therefore, we can speculate that the TP-Pd9 and Oh-Pd9 structures represent two separate energy minima;
otherwise, structures with intermediate twist angles should have formed.

To shed light on this point, the energies of two [Co15Pd9C3(CO)38]3– structures derived from the X-ray data obtained for TP-Pd9 and Oh-Pd9 isomers of [HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]2– were compared
using the PBEh-3c method (the hydride atom was not preliminarily included,
since it was not crystallographically located). The TP-Pd9 isomer was more stable by about 16 kcal mol–1 with
respect to the Oh-Pd9 isomer, in agreement with the fact
that the TP-Pd9 structure was the only one experimentally
found for the trianion [Co15Pd9C3(CO)38]3–. It is, however, worth noting
that the roles of crystal packing, cations, and solvent molecules
are not accounted. To make the model structures more similar from
an electronic point of view to the real compounds, a hydrogen atom
(formally as H+) was placed in the center of the clusters.
The TP-Pd9 structure remains also in this case the most
favorable by about 18 kcal mol–1. These preliminary
calculations suggest a key role of the position of the hydride in
the relative stability of the clusters and perhaps in the isomerization
process. Thus, the interconversion of the TP-Pd9 and Oh-Pd9 isomers cannot imply a simple reciprocal rotation of two
Pd3 triangles but must require a more complex mechanism,
probably involving also hydride migration within the metal cage of
the cluster. Because of the large size and complexity of such clusters,
it is not possible to perform more advanced computational investigations
on the possible mechanisms for the formation and/or interconversion
of the two isomers, including optimization of the position of the
hydride atom. Moreover, high nuclearity carbonyl nanoclusters such
as [HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]2– display almost featureless and identical UV–visible
spectra, hampering further experimental studies on the isomerization
process in solution.

Regarding the ionic packings of the different
salts, only normal
van der Waals contacts are present within the unit cells among the
cluster anions, organic cations, and co-crystallized solvent molecules.
There is no evidence of particular interactions that might favor the
TP-Pd9 or Oh-Pd9 isomers. Thus, the presence
of one or the other isomer (or a mixture of both) within a single
crystal should be due to a subtle balance of inter- and intra-molecular
interactions, which cannot be predicted a priori. This gives a further
support to our hypothesis that both isomers are present in solution.
Then, weak packing forces due to the cations and/or co-crystallized
solvent molecules may favor the crystallization of one or the other
isomer, or a mixture of both.

2.3 Molecular
Structure of [Co13Pd3C3(CO)29]−
The molecular structure of [Co13Pd3C3(CO)29]− has been determined as the
[NMe3(CH2Ph)][Co13Pd3C3(CO)29]·CH2Cl2 salt
(Figure 4, Tables S.3 and S.4). The cluster is composed
of a Co13Pd3C3 kernel stabilized
on its surface by 29 CO ligands. The average diameter of the Co13Pd3C3 core is 0.7 nm and, including
the carbonyl ligands, the average diameter of the whole molecule is
1.2 nm. The cluster may be partitioned into an inner triangular Pd3 unit bonded to a Co(CO)4 and a Co12C3(CO)25 fragment. The latter formally arises
from the condensation of three square-pyramidal Co5C units
sharing three vertices. An inner triangular Pd3 unit is
present also in the [Os18Pd3C2(CO)48]2– cluster, where the Pd3 core
is bonded to two Os9C(CO)24 fragments.33 These [Os18Pd3C2(CO)48]2– and [Co13Pd3C3(CO)29]− clusters,
as well as the parent [H3–nCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]n− (n = 0–3)30 and [H6–nCo20Pd16C4(CO)48]n− (n = 3–6),31 may be viewed as Pdn clusters stabilized by Co and Os organometallic fragments.

Figure 4 (a) Molecular
structure of [Co13Pd3C3(CO)29]− (orange, Pd; blue, Co;
red, O; gray, C). (b) Co13Pd3C3 core
represented with a color code that emphasizes its formal building-up:
the three Co5C units are represented in different colors
(blue, yellow, and green for Co) and shared atoms are bicolored. The
unique Co of Co(CO)4 is represented in purple and Pd atoms
in orange.

The carbide atoms are enclosed
within octahedral Co5PdC cages. [Co13Pd3C3(CO)29]− is the
second example of a metal carbonyl cluster
containing three isolated carbide atoms, [HCo16Pd2C3(CO)28]5– being the first
one.31 Conversely, [Ni12(C2)(C)(CO)17(AuPPh3)3]− presented one carbide and a C2-acetylide
unit.34

The Pd16, Pd9, and Pd3 cores of
[H2Co20Pd16C4(CO)48]4–, [HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]2– (at least one of its
isomers), and [Co13Pd3C3(CO)29]− may be structurally correlated as follows
(Figure 5). The Pd16 core of the largest cluster is a close-packed ccp (ABC 3
+ 6 + 7) arrangement of Pd atoms. Removing the C layer composed of
seven Pd atoms results in the close-packed (AB 3 + 6) Pd9 core of [HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]2– (Oh-Pd9 isomer). Further removal
of the B layer composed of seven Pd atoms eventually affords the triangular
Pd3 core of [Co13Pd3C3(CO)29]−. From a chemical point of view,
the removal of each Pdn layer is obtained
after oxidation of the cluster with strong acids. The first oxidative
degradation of the Pd core (Pd16 to Pd9) is
rather straightforward and, thus, [HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]2– can be obtained in
high yields starting from [H2Co20Pd16C4(CO)48]4–. Conversely,
the second oxidative degradation of the Pd core is very difficult,
and only traces of [Co13Pd3C3(CO)29]− can be obtained in the presence of a
large excess of an oxidant.

2.4 Molecular
Structure of [Co8Pd4C2(CO)24]2–
The molecular structure of the new
[Co8Pd4C2(CO)24]2– cluster has been determined
as its [NBu4]2[Co8Pd4C2(CO)24] salt. The structure of [Co8Pd4C2(CO)24]2– is very
similar to that of the previously reported [Co8Pt4C2(CO)24]2– (Figure 6).35 For the sake of comparison, the crystal structure of the isomorphous
[NBu4]2[Co8Pt4C2(CO)24] salt is included in this work. The Co8M4 (M = Pd, Pt) core of these clusters is a face-sharing
trioctahedron (Figure 7). The two carbide atoms are located in the outer octahedra. The
stereochemistry of the CO ligands is the same in both clusters, with
12 terminal and 12 edge-bridging carbonyls. The major difference between
[Co8Pd4C2(CO)24]2– and [Co8Pt4C2(CO)24]2– is related to the location of the four Pd and Pt
atoms. The metal atoms of [Co8Pd4C2(CO)24]2– are perfectly ordered, and
the four Pd atoms are located on the two internal triangles, two per
each triangle in a relative pseudo-trans position. Conversely, the
four Pt atoms of [Co8Pt4C2(CO)24]2– are disordered on the same two internal
triangles of the metal cage.

3 Conclusions
In summary, two structural isomers of the [HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]2– nanoclusters
have been isolated and their structures determined by single-crystal
X-ray crystallography as several different salts and solvates. These
nanoclusters are composed of a Pd9 core decorated on its
surface by three Co5C(CO)12 organometallic units.
The two isomers differ because of the different structures of the
Pd9 core, which may be a tricapped octahedron (Oh-Pd9) or a tricapped trigonal prism (TP-Pd9). This
represents a rare case of cluster core isomerism induced by weak crystal
packing forces. Indeed, the presence in the solid state of the Oh-Pd9 or the TP-Pd9 isomer depends on the cation employed
and/or the number and type of co-crystallized solvent molecules. Often,
mixtures of the two isomers, within the same single crystal or as
mixtures of different crystals within the same crystallization batch,
are obtained. This is quite surprising, since weak intermolecular
packing forces usually do not affect the total structure of nanoclusters,
or their influence is limited to the surface ligands.

Cluster
core isomerism24−28 has been recently documented also for Au–thiolates nanoclusters.21−23 A second type of structural isomerism found in Au–thiolate
nanoclusters is staple isomerism, which is two clusters possessing
the same metal core differ because of the disposition of the surface
staple motives.20,21,36 A related surface ligand isomerism has been documented also for
organometallic nanoclusters, and in particular in the case of cobalt
and nickel carbide carbonyl clusters decorated on the surface by [AuPPh3]+ fragments.34,37,38

Despite the different nature of the metals
and ligands involved
in Au–thiolate and organometallic (carbonyl) molecular nanoclusters,
there seems to be some general structural analogies among these categories
of atomic precise nanoclusters.7,8,39,40 These analogies somehow regard
the isomerization and dynamic behavior of their metal cores, as well
as the protective and adaptive nature of the staple motives or ligand
shells. As our understanding of the intimate total structures of metal
nanoparticles is increasing, by watching them with the eye of molecular
chemistry, concepts, which have been well consolidated along the years
in coordination and organometallic chemistry, find their application
also to describe metal nanoparticles.9,41−43

4.2 Synthesis of [CAT]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38] (CAT = NMe3(CH2Ph), NBu4, NEt3(CH2Ph), and MePPh3)
Solid
PdCl2(Et2S)2 (0.932 g, 2.90 mmol)
was added in small portions
to a solution of [NMe3(CH2Ph)]2[Co6C(CO)15] (1.37 g, 1.27 mmol) in thf (20 mL) over
a period of 2 h. After stirring the mixture at room temperature for
2 d, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was,
then, washed with H2O (2 × 20 mL) and toluene (2 ×
20 mL), and [NMe3(CH2Ph)]4[H2Co20Pd16C4(CO)48] extracted in dmf (15 mL). The cation was exchanged by adding a
saturated solution of [CAT]X (CAT = NMe3(CH2Ph), NBu4, NEt3(CH2Ph), and MePPh3; X = Cl, Br) in H2O (30 mL), and the precipitation
of [CAT]4[H2Co20Pd16C4(CO)48] was completed by addition of H2O (50 mL). The resulting solid was recovered by filtration, washed
with H2O (2 × 20 mL), and vacuum-dried. [CAT]4[H2Co20Pd16C4(CO)48] was dissolved in acetone (30 mL) and treated with HBF4·Et2O (500 μL, 3.62 mmol). After 10
min, the solvent was removed in vacuo and the residue dissolved in
CH2Cl2 (20 mL) and filtered. The solution was
eventually layered with n-hexane (40 mL), affording
single crystals of [NMe3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·CH2Cl2, [NMe3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·2CH2Cl2, [NEt3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·CH2Cl2, [MePPh3]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]·2.5CH2Cl2, and [MePPh3]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38] (yields based on Pd 45–55%).
When [CAT]+ = [NBu4]+, crystals of
[NBu4]2[Co8Pd4C2(CO)24] were obtained following the same procedure.

4.3 Synthesis of [CAT]3[Co15Pd9C3(CO)38]
A solution
obtained by adding NaOH (30 mg, 0.750 mmol) to [CAT]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38] (0.136 mmol)
in CH2Cl2 (20 mL) was stirred at room temperature
for 1 h. Well-shaped single crystals of [NMe3(CH2Ph)]3[Co15Pd9C3(CO)38]·CH2Cl2 and [MePPh3]3[Co15Pd9C3(CO)38]·CH2Cl2 were obtained by slow
diffusion of n-hexane (40 mL) on the filtered solution
(85–90% based on Pd).

Alternatively, [CAT]3[Co15Pd9C3(CO)38] can
be obtained according to the procedure described in Section 4.2 using HBF4·Et2O (350 μL, 2.53 mmol).

HBF4·Et2O (800 μL, 3.10
mmol) was added to [NMe3(CH2Ph)]2[HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38] (0.41
g, 0.125 mmol) dissolved in CH2Cl2 (20 mL).
After stirring at room temperature for 1
h, the mixture was filtered. A few crystals of [NMe3(CH2Ph)][Co13Pd3C3(CO)29]·CH2Cl2 suitable for single-crystal X-ray
studies were obtained by slow diffusion of n-hexane
(40 mL) on the CH2Cl2 solution.

4.5 Synthesis of [NBu4]2[Co8Pt4C2(CO)24]
A mixture of PtCl2(Et2S)2 (0.95
g, 2.13 mmol) and [NBu4]2[Co6C(CO)15] (1.38 g, 1.03 mmol) dissolved in thf (30 mL) was stirred
at room temperature for 3 d and, then, the solvent removed in vacuo.
After washing with H2O (40 mL) and toluene (30 mL), the
solid was extracted in thf (30 mL). X-ray quality crystals of [NBu4]2[Co8Pt4C2(CO)24] were obtained by slow diffusion of n-hexane
(60 mL) (yield 1.06 g, 82% based on Pt).

hexagons (AFIX 66 line in SHELXL).

4.6.10 [NMe3(CH2Ph)]3[Co15Pd9C3(CO)38]·CH2Cl2 (Pca21) (10)
The
asymmetric unit of the unit cell
contains one cluster anion, three [NMe3(CH2Ph)]+ cations, and one CH2Cl2 molecule (all
located on general positions). One [NMe3(CH2Ph)]+ cation is disordered and, therefore, its atoms have
been split into two positions and refined using one occupancy parameter
per disordered group. The crystals are racemically twinned with refined
Flack parameter 0.460(19). Some C and O atoms have been restrained
to isotropic behavior (ISOR line in SHELXL, s.u. 0.001). The [NMe3(CH2Ph)]+ cations have been restrained
to have similar geometries (SAME line in SHELXL, s.u. 0.02). All aromatic
rings have been constrained to fit regular hexagons (AFIX 66 line
in SHELXL).

4.6.11 [MePPh3]3[Co15Pd9C3(CO)38]·CH2Cl2 (11)
The
structure contains
one independent cluster anion, three independent [MeNPh3]+ cations, and one independent and disordered CH2Cl2 molecule (all located on general positions).
The disordered CH2Cl2 molecule has been split
into two positions and refined using one occupancy parameter per disordered
group. Similar U restraints have been applied to
the C and O atoms (SIMU line in SHELXL, s.u. 0.02). All aromatic rings
have been constrained to fit regular hexagons (AFIX 66 line in SHELXL).
Restraints to bond distances were applied as follows (s.u. 0.02):
1.75 Å for C–Cl in CH2Cl2.

4.6.12 [NMe3(CH2Ph)][Co13Pd3C3(CO)29]·CH2Cl2 (12)
The asymmetric unit
of the unit cell contains two cluster anions, two [NMe3(CH2Ph)]+ cations, and one CH2Cl2 molecule (all located on general positions).

4.6.13 [NBu4]2[Co8Pd4C2(CO)24] (13)
The asymmetric
unit of the unit cell contains half of a cluster
anion (located on an inversion center) and one [NBu4]+ cation (located on a general position). One Bu group of the
[NBu4]+ cation is disordered and, therefore,
its atoms have been split into two positions and refined using one
occupancy parameter per disordered group. Similar U restraints have been applied to the C and O atoms of the disordered
groups (SIMU line in SHELXL, s.u. 0.01).

4.6.14 [NBu4]2[Co8Pt4C2(CO)24] (14)
The asymmetric unit of the unit
cell contains half of a cluster
anion (located on an inversion center) and one [NBu4]+ cation (located on a general position). M(1), M(2), and M(3)
represent disordered positions, partially occupied by Co and Pt. A
free variable was assigned to each position and dummy atom constraints
(instructions EXYZ and EADP in SHELXL) adopted for their refinement.
Similar U restraints have been applied to the [NBu4]+ cation (SIMU line in SHELXL, s.u. 0.005). Restraints
to bond distances were applied as follows (s.u. 0.01): 1.47 Å
for C–N and 1.53 Å for C–C in [NBu4]+.

4.7 Computational Details
Energy calculations
were carried out on two [Co15Pd9C3(CO)38]3– structures using the recently
developed PBEh-3c method.49 PBEh-3c is
based on a variant of the PBE0 global hybrid density functional50 with increased amount of Fock exchange, together
with a small, polarized valence-double-ζ basis set based on
a modification of Ahlrich’s def2-SV(P) basis set, with relativistic
effective core potential for Pd.51 The
atom-pairwise correction schemes geometrical counterpoise for basis
set errors52 and D3 for London dispersion53 are added. Cartesian coordinates of the atoms
were obtained from X-ray data collected for the [HCo15Pd9C3(CO)38]2– monohydrides
TP-Pd9 and Oh-Pd9. Further single-point calculations
were carried out on the same structures with the addition of a hydrogen
atom (formally as H+) at the centers of the cages. The
software used was ORCA 4.0.1.2,54 running
on Intel-based x86-64 workstations.
