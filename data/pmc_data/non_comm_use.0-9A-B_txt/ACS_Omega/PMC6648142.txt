Graphene of two different
aspect ratios, Af, was melt mixed with
poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) to
form amorphous PET/graphene composites with less than 5% crystallinity.
The higher-order structure and mechanical properties of poly(ethylene
terephthalate) (PET) in these composites were investigated using techniques
such as differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis,
whereas transmission electron microscopy, melt rheology, and electrical
conductivity were used to study the graphene dispersion. A decrease
in heat capacity changes, ΔCp, of
PET in nanocomposites at the glass transition temperature, Tg, without Tg change
suggests that a rigid amorphous fraction (RAF) of PET was formed at
the PET/graphene interface. The stiffening effect of graphene below
1 wt % loading is quite small in the glassy state region and independent
of the Af of graphene. Above 2 wt %, graphene
forms a mechanical percolation network with the RAF of PET and the
PET chains are geometrically restricted by the incorporation of graphene
with a high Af, resulting in an unexpectedly
higher modulus of nanocomposites both below and above Tg.

1 Introduction
Poly(ethylene
terephthalate) (PET) is a semicrystalline thermoplastic
characterized by good mechanical properties and easy moldability as
well as a high glass transition temperature (Tg) and chemical resistance. The preceding characteristics result
in PET being a high-performance polymer that is useful in numerous
industrial products in the forms of films, fibers, and bottles.1 PET films are typically produced by extrusion
of PET resin, following which additional processing steps are used,
such as annealing and tentering. These steps play a significant part
in directing the formation of higher-order structures in PET, including
chain orientation and crystallites, which results in improvements
to the physicochemical film properties.

The higher-order structure
of solid PET is usually represented
by a three-phase model, which includes a crystalline phase, a rigid
amorphous fraction (RAF), and a movable amorphous fraction (MAF).2 The RAF represents the fraction of the amorphous
phase that possesses partial order and is responsible for reducing
the mobility of PET chains. The RAF is usually positioned between
the MAF and the crystalline phase, which means that it has no contribution
to the jump in heat capacity at the glass transition. These higher-order
structures also affect the mechanical2,3 and gas-barrier
properties of PET4,5 as well as its wear resistance.6 Fu et al.7 reported
that the intermediate phase (i.e., RAF) enhances the tenacity of PET
fiber. Rastogi et al.2 reported unexpectedly
low yield stress during compression due to the formation of small
crystals and because of the presence of a large RAF content. Lin et
al.4 reported unexpectedly higher O2 solubility in crystalline PET due to the formation of RAF.

The introduction and blending of nanoparticles as fillers is a
commonly used technique to improve the mechanical and gas-barrier
properties of polymers, including PET, as well as their thermal and
dimensional stability. An especially potent class of nanofillers is
that of two-dimensional (2D) nanoplatelets, as these have high aspect
ratios, which enable them to provide a greater improvement to polymeric
properties than their spherical counterparts.8,9 Modified
clay10−19 and graphene20−33 are commonly utilized as 2D nanoplatelet fillers, with graphene
recently attracting wide interest due to its combination of 2D morphology
and excellent mechanical and electrical properties.20−33 Graphene has been shown to enhance the mechanical and gas-barrier
properties of nanocomposites as well as their electrical conductivity
and dimensional stability.25−29 It was previously shown by Zhang et al.25 that the increase in electrical conductivity of melt-mixed PET/graphene
nanocomposites compared with pure PET is significantly more than that
obtained via melt-mixed PET/graphite composites. Moreover, it was
shown by Feng et al.26 that PET/graphene
nanocomposites produced via in situ polymerization resulted in a much
larger enhancement in electrical conductivity compared with melt blending
(approximately 4 orders of magnitude). Furthermore, Bandla et al.27 and Li et al.28 blended
graphene with PET and observed an increase in the Young’s modulus
and dynamic storage modulus of the resulting nanocomposites. However,
all of the preceding studies only discussed the properties of the
mentioned composites (particularly, mechanical properties) from the
perspective of the graphene-in-PET dispersibility. There have been
no studies investigating the higher-order structure of PET in PET/graphene
nanocomposites.

The objective of this investigation is to study
the higher-order
structure in PET/graphene nanocomposites and its effect on their mechanical
properties. The study was conducted by selecting two graphenes, each
with its own aspect ratio, Af, and melt
mixing them as nanofillers with PET. The higher-order structure of
PET in the resulting nanocomposites was investigated by differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA),
and its effect on the mechanical properties of PET/graphene nanocomposites
with different graphene loading was then discussed.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Rheological Properties
and Dispersion Level
of PET-Based Nanocomposites
Melt rheology was used to characterize
the nanocomposites in terms of (1) the level of graphene-in-PET dispersibility
and (2) the degradation level of the PET matrix, if any, as a result
of graphene blending. The complex viscosity, η*, and storage
modulus, G′, of the nanocomposite melt are
demonstrated in Figure S1. The η*
of the neat PET melt exhibits a pseudo-Newtonian behavior, whereas
those of both nanocomposites showed significant shear thinning, as
typically exhibited by such nanocomposites (Figure S1a,b).36,37 At low frequencies, the η*
of the nanocomposites was found to be greater than that of neat PET.
In particular, PET/G2 demonstrated a higher η* than PET/G1,
reflecting the higher aspect ratio of the former, as typically observed
in polymer nanocomposites of platelet-shaped fillers.36 At higher frequencies, the η* of the nanocomposites
are decreased and are closer to that of neat PET; this is because
the contribution of the polymeric matrix is more significant at such
frequencies.36 In previous studies, it
was demonstrated that PET/clay nanocomposites exhibit a lower η*
than neat PET at higher frequencies, which was correlated to the high
levels of polymer matrix degradation.36,37 However, the
η*of both the PET/G1 and PET/G2 nanocomposites in this study
are equal to or more than that for neat PET at all frequencies, indicating
that the decomposition of PET is not enhanced by the addition of graphene
and that the molecular weight of PET in all of the mentioned nanocomposites
is thus similar to that of neat PET.37 The
measured G′ of the PET/graphene nanocomposites
further corroborates the preceding observation; contrary to the more
strongly degenerating PET/clay nanocomposites,36,37 the G′ of the PET/graphene nanocomposites
examined in this study approaches that of the neat PET as a lower
limit at higher frequencies, never falling beneath the G′ of the neat PET (Figure S1c,d).

Additionally, it may be observed that at lower frequencies, G′ rises as a function of graphene loading, becoming
frequency independent above a certain critical loading, which is a
typical solid-like frequency response displayed by polymeric composite
melts containing 2D fillers.30 The dispersion
quality of the nanocomposite samples was studied qualitatively and
quantitatively using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and melt
rheology, respectively, as in our previous studies.30Af, which is a ratio of diameter D to thickness h, was estimated for the
two graphenes used in this study to be 14 for PET/G1 and 63 for PET/G2
based on the dispersion rheology of the melts.30

Representative TEM images and interparticle distances,
λ,
of PET/G1 and PET/G2 are shown in Figure 1 (the TEM images based on which λ was
calculated are shown in Figures S2 and S3 in the Supporting Information and the detailed procedure for λ
estimation is reported elsewhere30). Both
G1 (the lower aspect ratio and thicker stacks) and G2 (the higher
aspect ratio and thinner stacks) appear to have dispersed well in
the PET matrix, even though some G1 aggregated stacks can be observed
in the images. G2 dispersed in the composites in the form of few-layered
stacks, which appear to be aligned in roughly the same direction,
with the sheet edges twisted and wrinkled. The λ of PET/G2 was
measured to be approximately ≤1 μm for the lower graphene
loadings and became ∼100 nm for loadings greater than 0.5 wt
%. It was also observed that λ in PET/G1 was greater than that
for PET/G2, given the similar graphene loadings. Presumably due to
its lower aspect ratio, it took twice as much loading of G1 (compared
with G2) for its λ in the PET/G1 composites to match that of
G2 in the PET/G2 composites.30

% of graphene and (c) interparticle distances, λ, of PET/G1
and PET/G2.30

2.2 Electrical Properties
The electrical
resistance of the PET/graphene composites was measured as a corroborative
method of studying the graphene dispersion level. The surface resistances
of the PET/graphene composites are shown in Figure 2. The melt blending of both G1 and G2 was
observed to decrease the nanocomposite surface resistance significantly
below that of neat PET, with the mentioned reduction in surface resistance
increasing as a function of graphene loading. The electrical percolation
threshold Φper of G2 in PET/G2 composites was lower
than that for G1 in PET/G1 composites, reflecting that G2 has a higher
aspect ratio than G1 in the PET matrix, which is consistent both with
earlier observations from rheology and with the qualitative TEM image
evidence, and is moreover consistent with characterization results
from our previous work on the same.30 To
convert the weights of the graphenes and PET to volumes and enable
the calculation of volume fractions, the density of graphene was considered
as 2.28 g cm–3 (as typically reported in the literature),23,24,30 whereas 1.335 g cm–3 was taken as the density for pure PET.30,38 From exponential approximation lines of reduced surface resistance
area, we estimate Φper of graphene in PET to be 0.023
(4.0 wt %) for G1 and 0.003 (0.62 wt %) for G2. Based on the estimated
percolation thresholds and the assumption of graphene sheets being
monodisperse 2D circular disks, Af was
estimated using eq 1(17,39−41) 1  where Φsphere = 0.29, which
is the onset of percolation for interpenetrating, randomly packed
spheres.42 Based on the preceding equation
and using Φper = 0.023 (4.0 wt %) for PET/G1 and
Φper = 0.003 (0.62 wt %) for PET/G2, Af values for PET/G1 and PET/G2 were estimated to be 20
and 128, respectively (summary in Table 1). This indicates that G2 can form an electrical
percolation network more easily than G1.

It is worthy to mention that the electrical percolation
measurements
consistently seem to overestimate the aspect ratios of G1 and G2 compared
with the rheological percolation measurements, as seen in Table 1. This is thought
to be because electrical and rheological percolation are phenomenologically
different; electrical percolation occurs when free electrons become
capable of conducting electric current by hopping between neighboring
(adjacent) graphene sheets due to proximity. On the other hand, rheological
percolation is the result of a combined effect of (1) molecular restriction
of the matrix polymer by the platelet graphene fillers, which results
in chain confinement effects, and (2) the interaction between neighboring
graphene sheets. This chain confinement effect, absent from the picture
in electrical percolation, is thought to be particularly strong in
PET/graphene nanocomposites such as our own, owing to the relatively
large aspect ratio of graphene sheets, which are effective at chain
confinement due to the large sheer ratio of the sheet surface area
to chain length. The phenomenological difference between the two mechanisms
is thus believed to be responsible for the discrepancy between the
two sets of aspect ratio estimates.

2.3 Thermal
Properties and Higher-Order Structure
of PET in Nanocomposites
DSC was measured on the nanocomposites
to study the higher-order structure of PET. The DSC curves for the
first heating scan are depicted in Figure 3 (complete profiles and Tg of nanocomposites are depicted in Figures S4 and S5 in the Supporting Information). Figure 4 shows the higher-order
structures such as crystallinity and the RAF contents of PET in the
amorphous PET/graphene nanocomposites per the three-phase model. The
first heating scan, starting from room temperature, showed the following
for all nanocomposite samples: (1) stepwise endothermic changes for
glass transition, (2) exothermic peaks for cold crystallization, and
(3) endothermic peaks for crystal melting. The peak heat flow for
cold crystallization of all nanocomposites shifted to lower temperatures
compared with that of neat PET, indicating that graphene plays the
role of a nucleating agent for crystallization in all nanocomposite
samples. Furthermore, the peak shapes of PET-based nanocomposites
became wider, indicating that the nanocomposite cold crystallization
process takes a longer time to complete than for neat PET.43 In spite of the variability observed across
samples in terms of the cold crystallization behavior, it was observed
for all of the samples that the crystallinity level is less than 5%
(meaning that these samples are all nearly amorphous, as depicted
in Figure 4a). Since
the RAF of PET forms when the volume fraction of crystallinity is
above 0.07,4 the amount of RAF in the amorphous
neat PET can be regarded as zero.

Figure 3 Representative DSC profiles of neat PET
and PET/graphene nanocomposites
(first heating scan at 10 °C min–1).

Figure 4 (a) Crystallinity and (b) RAF contents of PET/graphene
nanocomposites.

No significant Tg change (Figure S5 in Supporting Information) is observed
in any sample, which is a typical phenomenon of nanocomposites produced
by melt blending, indicating no covalent bonding or strong hydrogen
bonding in our systems.44 Despite the crystallinity
of all samples being similar and quite small, ΔCp of nanocomposites at Tg became
smaller than that for neat PET (Figure 3), suggesting that graphene induces the formation of
RAF. The RAF contents in PET/graphene nanocomposites increased with
an increase in graphene concentration (Figure 4b; i.e., MAF concentrations are decreased
(Figure S6), and, notably, G2 with a higher
aspect ratio created more RAF than G1 for the same loading. Ma et.al.34 reported that the RAF in amorphous PET/SiO2 nanocomposites was caused by the restriction of the mobility
of PET chains by the interaction between PET and SiO2.
The interfacial area per unit volume, (Sv)p–c, of graphene in the PET/graphene nanocomposites
was measured from the TEM images using Basu’s method, which
assumes that the 2D graphene nanofillers can all be morphologically
approximated as circular disks.30,45 The relationship between
(Sv)p–c and RAF contents
is shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Relationship between the interfacial area per unit volume, (Sv)p–c, and RAF contents of
PET/graphene nanocomposites. The detailed procedure for analysis of
(Sv)p–c is reported
elsewhere.30

The RAF content increased in the PET/graphene nanocomposites
with
an increase in (Sv)p–c. The fact that PET/G1 and PET/G2 show the same dependence on area
indicates that RAF is indeed controlled by surface interactions. In
our previous study,30 the PET/G1 and PET/G2
nanocomposites were studied using Raman spectroscopy and the peak
locations of the ring C–C band in the spectra were shown to
be shifted to lower wavenumbers, which increased with the graphene
loading used in the nanocomposites, with PET/G2 experiencing a greater
shift than PET/G1 (Figure S7). The latter
observations suggest that PET can interact with graphene by the aromatic
PET/graphene interactions. Therefore, it can be inferred that the
RAF of PET in nanocomposites is mainly formed at the PET/graphene
interface and that the PET chain interfacial mobility is hindered
even in the amorphous state.2 Normally,
the Tg of PET increases with an increase
in the crystallinity due to the mobility restriction of PET chains
by the formation of RAF at the interface between crystals and the
MAF.4 However, no such Tg change is observed in our systems. Therefore, the RAF
in the nanocomposites is fundamentally different from the RAF in crystallized
PET. Molecular chains of PET in nanocomposites are confined by π–π
interactions between graphene and PET, but the restriction and confinement
of these chains by the addition of graphene is relatively weaker than
for chains in crystallized PET.

2.4 Glass
Transition Behavior and Mechanical Properties
DMA was used
to measure the mechanical properties of the PET/graphene
nanocomposites. The dependencies of the dynamic storage moduli, E′, and tan  δ of the nanocomposites
on temperature are shown in Figure 6. The E′ values of all samples
were relatively constant below 70 °C (the glassy state region),
and then dropped significantly over the glass transition range, and
finally increased due to cold crystallization above 100 °C (Figure 6a,b).

Figure 6 Dynamic storage moduli, E′, for (a) PET/G1
and (b) PET/G2 and tan δ for (c) PET/G1 and (d) PET/G2.
Measurements were conducted at 1 Hz at 2 °C min–1.

The peak of tan δ
occurs due to the chain-segmental
relaxation phenomena taking place during the glass–rubber transition
in nanocomposites of PET, and these peak positions in DMA are normally
taken to correspond to Tg. The DMA results
(Figure 6) also show
that the Tg values for the PET/graphene
composites remain nearly constant despite the incorporation of graphene,
which is consistent with the Tg trends
obtained via DSC (see Figure S5 in the
Supporting information). Tan δ peak values are plotted
against the nanofiller loading in Figure 7 and the E′ and E″ at the peak tan δ are plotted in Figure S8. Although the RAF content increased
with an increase in graphene loading (Figures 4b and 5), the peak
values of tan δ of PET/G1 with a smaller aspect ratio
remained nearly constant. Both E′ and E″ of PET/G1 also remained constant (Figure S8). This indicates that the restriction
of molecular chains of PET/G1 is limited to the interfacial region
(i.e., in RAF) and does not affect other amorphous regions (i.e.,
MAF). On the other hand, the peak values of tan δ of
PET/G2 decreased with an increase in graphene loading even though E″ was increased. Our previous study30 suggests that narrower interparticle distances of G2 in
PET/G2 cause a stronger restriction of PET chains than G1 by geometrical
confinement. Considering that RAF is mainly formed in the interfacial
region between PET and graphene, the decrease in the tan δ
of PET/G2 accompanied with the increase in E″
indicates that G2 in the PET matrix, especially around 2 wt %, restricts
the molecular movement of the amorphous PET chains both in the interfacial
region (i.e., in RAF) and in the amorphous region (i.e., MAF).46

Figure 7 Tan δ peak values of PET/graphene nanocomposites.
Measurements were conducted at 1 Hz at 10 °C min–1. Error bars of PET/G1 are smaller than the size of points.

The moduli at 40 °C (glassy
state) and 100 °C (rubbery
state) were normalized by the moduli of neat PET and plotted against
the nanofiller loading (Figure 8). At 40 °C, PET exhibits a glassy behavior and so the
moduli values at this temperature are significantly greater than at
100 °C. The addition of G1 increased the moduli of PET slightly
and nearly linearly. The E′ of PET/G1 with
2 wt % of graphene was only 4% higher than that of neat PET at 40
°C. However, a different reinforcement effect was exhibited for
G2. Below 1 wt % of graphene loading, the addition of G2 caused no
significant difference in the trend of E′
compared with G1, whereas an unexpectedly higher modulus of PET/G2
was seen at 2 wt % G2, with the E′ of PET/G2
nanocomposites being 21% more than that of PET at 40 °C.

Figure 8 Normalized
dynamic storage moduli, E′/E0, of PET/graphene nanocomposites at (a) 40
°C and (b) 100 °C.

At 100 °C, PET displays a rubbery behavior, thus leading
to
a larger reinforcement effect being observed in nanocomposites at
this temperature compared with 40 °C. The loading of G1 to the
PET by melt blending increased the modulus of PET nearly linearly.
The E′ of PET/G1 with 2 wt % of graphene was
20% more than that of PET at 100 °C. However, the modulus of
PET/G2 below 1 wt % graphene loading became higher than that of PET/G1,
and a remarkable enhancement of E′ was observed
at 2 wt % of graphene loading. The E′ of PET/G2
with 2 wt % of graphene was 370% greater than that of PET at 100 °C.

Di Lorenzo et al.47 reported that the
overall rigid fraction (i.e., the total of crystallinity and RAF contents, Xc + Xra) correlates
with the moduli of polymeric materials in the glassy state and that
the confinement effect enhances the modulus of the PET matrix.34 However, there is no significant difference
between G1 and G2 below 1% at 40 °C even though the Af of G2 and the RAF contents of PET/G2 are higher than
those for PET/G1. This lowered stiffening effect below 1% is partially
due to the fact that the reinforcing effect decreases when the value
of the matrix modulus approaches that of the material used as a filler.23,48,49 Additionally, the properties
of nanocomposites are influenced by the morphology and physicochemical
properties of the nanofillers, the evenness of nanofiller dispersion
throughout the nanocomposite, and the matrix–nanofiller interfacial
adhesion. Our previous studies suggest that G2 in PET is wrinkled
and twisted30 and that the PET/graphene
interfacial adhesion is relatively lower than for other composites
in the glassy state.50 Therefore, the lower
stress transfer efficiency by the lower PET/graphene interfacial adhesion
in the glassy state,50 coupled with the
lower alignment of fillers compared with the ideal structure, both
contribute to low stiffening effects for G2 below 1% in the glassy
state region.

Above Tg, PET softens
and the matrix
modulus becomes much lower than that of the filler modulus. Additionally,
the interfacial adhesion in both PET/graphene and PET/clay nanocomposites
is markedly stronger than in the glassy region.50 This is most likely due to the PET viscoelasticity in the
rubbery state: a commonly observed phenomenon in pressure-sensitive
adhesives above Tg.(51) The big difference in the moduli between the polymer and
the nanofiller coupled with the enhanced interfacial adhesion above Tg causes a larger reinforcement effect in the
nanocomposites, resulting in PET/G2 composites with a higher Af displaying higher moduli than the PET/G1 composites
in the rubbery state.

Above 1 wt % of graphene loading, the
unexpectedly higher modulus
of PET/G2 with 2 wt % of graphene at both 40 and 100 °C may be
justified by the formation of rigid filler networks.52,53 As mentioned above, the RAF contents in PET/G2 with 2 wt % graphene
increased up to 22% and formed at interfacial regions. Our previous
study suggests that PET chains in PET/G2 are more confined compared
with PET/G1.30 Therefore, the unexpectedly
higher modulus of PET/G2 with 2 wt % of graphene indicates the formation
of mechanical percolation networks of graphene with the RAF of PET
at interfacial regions with confined PET matrixes. This mechanical
percolation threshold was estimated between 1 and 2 wt %, which matches
with the percolation thresholds of the molten dispersions (∼1.11
wt %) from our previous study.30

2.5 Internal Structure and Its Correlation with
Bulk Mechanical Properties
The preceding results led us to
form the following summative view of the mechanical properties of
PET/graphene nanocomposites (as summarized in Figure 9): the RAF of PET in nanocomposites is formed
at the PET/graphene interface by the aromatic interactions between
the matrix and the filler, both of which contain a π–π
conjugation. Molecular chains of PET in nanocomposites are clearly
confined compared with neat PET, but the restriction of these chains
by the addition of graphene is relatively weaker than in crystallized
PET. Below 1 wt % of graphene loading, the restriction of PET chains
is mostly limited to the interfacial region (i.e., RAF) as shown in Figure 9a. Therefore, the
stiffness enhancement effects caused by the addition of the two graphenes
are dictated by simple mixing rules. However, below Tg, the matrix/filler interfacial adhesion grows weaker
in the glassy state with the result being a drop in the stress transfer
efficiency.52 The reduced stress transfer
efficiency, in turn, means that there is a smaller increase in the
modulus, which is independent of Af. On
the other hand, above Tg, the difference
in the filler size significantly affects the mentioned reinforcement
effects due to the improved stress transfer efficiency resulting from
the enhanced interfacial adhesion that occurs in the rubbery state.
Therefore, the PET/G2 composites (which have a higher Af) showed higher moduli than PET/G1 composites in the
rubbery state region.

Figure 9 Suggested structures of PET/G1 and PET/G2 at (a) below
1% and (b)
2 wt % of graphene loading.

Above 2 wt %, the restriction of molecular chains of PET/G1
is
still limited to the interfacial region (i.e., in RAF) mainly due
to wider interparticle distances than in PET/G2 as shown in Figure 9b. Therefore, the
stiffness effects of G1 are still dictated by simple mixing rules,
resulting in the modulus of PET/G1 increasing slightly and nearly
linearly at a graphene loading of 2 wt %. On the other hand, the formation
of hybrid mechanical percolation networks of G2 with the RAF of PET
geometrically restricts the mobility of PET chains in PET/G2 due to
the higher aspect ratio and the narrower interparticle distance. Integrated
confinement effects of RAF and the geometrical restriction enhance
the modulus of the PET matrix.34,47 Therefore, the combined
effects of the mechanical percolation network of graphene with the
RAF of PET at the interfaces and the confined PET matrix cause a drastic
enhancement of the moduli of PET/G2 both below and above Tg.

3 Conclusions
PET
was melt mixed with two graphene nanofillers (G1 and G2), each
with its own aspect ratio. From the electrical properties, the percolation
threshold of G2 in PET/G2 composites was estimated to be lower than
that of G1 in PET/G1 composites, indicating that G2 has a larger aspect
ratio than G1 in the PET matrix, which is consistent with observations
from melt rheology. From the DSC study, PET in amorphous nanocomposites
showed a decreased heat capacity at Tg with increasing graphene concentration, suggesting the presence
of a significant RAF of PET in the mentioned composites even in the
amorphous state. The RAF contents in the nanocomposites also increased
with an increase in the graphene loading and correlated with the interfacial
area between PET and graphene, but no Tg change was observed. The preceding observations indicate that the
RAF is primarily formed in the interfacial region between PET and
graphene and that the restriction effect on these chains resulting
from the addition of graphene is relatively weaker than in crystallized
PET. From the DMA study, below 1 wt % of graphene loading, the stiffening
effects of G1 and G2 were observed to be quite small and showed no
significant differences in the glassy region due to the wrinkled structure
and the nonperfect alignment of the graphene in PET as well as the
lower PET/graphene interfacial adhesion. On the other hand, a significant
reinforcement effect was observed above Tg due to the enhanced interfacial adhesion. Moreover, PET/G2 composites
showed higher moduli than PET/G1 composites in the rubbery state region,
an observation that was attributed to the higher Af of G2 in the former. Above 2 wt % loading, hybrid mechanical
percolation networks of G2 and RAF of PET suppress the molecular movements
of PET chains more effectively than G1 because of the larger specific
interfacial area and narrower interparticle distance of the former.
The combined effect of the hybrid mechanical percolation network and
confined PET matrix drastically enhances the modulus of PET/G2 both
below and above Tg.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
PET pellets were obtained
from Toray Plastics America (North Kingstown, RI). These pellets were
crushed into a powder of particle size 30 mesh using a Polyvision
instrument (Manchester, PA). Following the grinding, the intrinsic
viscosity of the PET was found to be 0.61 dL g–1 using ortho-chlorophenol. As nanofillers, two batches of graphene
(G1 and G2) of different aspect ratios were used as received. G1 was
obtained from XG Science (Product code: xGnP-C750, multilayer, diameter
< 2 μm), whereas G2 was obtained from Angstron Materials
(Product code: N002-PDR, <3 layers per sheet, diameter < 10
μm). Both the PET and graphene were dried in vacuo at 120 °C
for >12 h prior to melt mixing.

4.2 Preparation
of Nanocomposites
The
PET and graphene were melt mixed to produce nanocomposites according
to a previously published method described in Scheme 1.30 PET/graphene
mixtures of 5.5 g were fed into a recirculating twin-screw extruder
(Microcompounder, DACA Instruments) using different graphene loadings
(0–12 wt % for G1 and 0–2 wt % for G2) at 280 °C
using N2 as the purge gas. The PET and graphene were blended
at 360 rpm for 8 min and cooled afterward via extrusion into an ice/water
bath. The nanocomposites produced by this method were dried in vacuo
at 120 °C for >12 h. Thin sections (120–180 μm)
were prepared for characterization (TEM, DSC, and DMA) by pressing
the mentioned samples between fiber-reinforced Teflon sheets at 270
°C and 1–1.5 MPa for 2 min followed by rapid quenching
in ice water to prevent crystallization.

4.3 Melt Rheology
The rheology of the
nanocomposites was investigated using a strain-controlled rotational
rheometer (ARES, TA Instruments) at 270 °C under an N2 blanket. Detailed rheological measurement parameters are reported
elsewhere.30

4.4 TEM Imaging
and Interparticle Distance Measurement
TEM images were acquired
using a Tecnai T12 TEM from FEI using
120 kV as the accelerating voltage. Detailed sample preparation for
TEM and imaging conditions and parameters are reported elsewhere.30

4.5 DSC Measurement
DSC for the samples
was measured on a Q1000 device from TA Instruments under an inert
N2 blanket. The amorphous sheet samples were initially
heated to 280 °C at 10 °C min–1 and held
at 280 °C for 1 min (first heating scan). To enable the investigation
of the higher-order structure, the glass transition parameters (i.e.,
glass transition temperature, Tg, and
heat capacity change, ΔCp), cold
crystallization parameters (i.e., heat of fusion, ΔHcc), and crystal melting parameters (i.e., melting temperature, Tm, and heat of fusion, ΔHm) were obtained from the first heating scan. Because
the RAF of PET typically forms when the volume fraction of crystallinity
is more than 0.07,4 we assume that amorphous
neat PET has an RAF of 100%,4 which means
that the change of ΔCp in nanocomposites
is assumed to reflect the change of MAF, Xma, with the incorporation of graphene. The Xma in nanocomposites was calculated by eq 2(34,35) 2  where ΔCp,0 is the ΔCp for amorphous neat
PET, ΔCp,c is the ΔCp for nanocomposite samples, and w is the weight fraction of the nanofillers. The percent amount of
RAF, Xra, in the nanocomposites was calculated
by eq 3(34,35) 3  

4.6 Electrical Properties
The surface
resistance of the nanocomposite films was measured using an 11-probe
DC resistance meter (Prostat-801).

4.7 DMA Measurement
DMA for the samples
was measured on a Rheometrics Solid Analyzer, RSA-G2 (TA Instruments,
New Castle, DE). The specimens for DMA measurements were sectioned
from nanocomposite sheets into strips of 6 mm × 40 mm of rectangular
shape. Temperature ramp measurements were performed from 25 to 180
°C at 2 °C min–1 and a frequency of 1
Hz.

4.8 Raman Spectroscopy
Raman measurements
on the samples were obtained using an α 300R confocal Raman
microscope equipped with a UHTS200 spectrometer and a DV401 charged-coupled
device detector from WITec (Ulm, Germany). Detailed measurement conditions
are reported elsewhere.30
