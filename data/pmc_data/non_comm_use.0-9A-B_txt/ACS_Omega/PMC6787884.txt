Direct
energy conversion of heat into electricity using thermoelectric
materials is an attractive solution to help address global energy
issues. Developing novel materials composed of earth-abundant and
nontoxic elements will aid progress toward the goal of sustainable
thermoelectric materials. In this study, we chemically synthesized
Cu–Zn–Sn–S nanocrystals and fabricated a Cu3ZnSnS5–y thermoelectric
material using nanocrystals as building blocks. The figure-of-merit
(ZT) value of the Cu3ZnSnS5–y material was found to be 0.39 at 658 K. We substituted
Zn with Al in the Cu3ZnSnS5–y system to form Cu3Zn1–xAlxSnS5–y (x = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1) to lower the
lattice thermal conductivity of the resulting materials. Complete
substitution of Al for Zn substantially decreased the lattice thermal
conductivity and dramatically increased the electrical conductivity
of the material. However, the ZT value could not
be significantly enhanced, which could be primarily attributed to
the high carrier thermal conductivity. These results highlight the
production of Cu3Zn1–xAlxSnS5–y thermoelectric materials and unveil the scope for improvement
of ZT values by altering transport properties.

Introduction
Waste heat recovery
has attracted attention in the last few decades,
which has led to rapid progress in the development of thermoelectric
materials. The performance of thermoelectric materials can be rated
through a dimensionless quantity called the figure of merit (ZT), which is expressed as ZT = σS2T/κ, where σ, S, κ, and T are electrical conductivity,
Seebeck coefficient, thermal conductivity, and absolute temperature,
respectively. To improve the ZT value, it is important
to increase the power factor (PF = σS2) and/or decrease κ. In nanostructured materials, κ can
be decreased considerably by lowering the lattice thermal conductivity
(κlat) through phonon scattering at grain boundaries,1,2 whereas PF can be enhanced through quantum confinement or energy
filtering.3 Several researchers have demonstrated
the enhancement of ZT through nanostructuring, such
as the formation of sintered nanocomposites.4,5 However,
most of these materials are prepared through complicated processes
that are both energy- and time-consuming, which limit the development
of thermoelectric materials and the wide application of thermoelectric
devices. Furthermore, most thermoelectric materials are composed of
heavy transition metals or rare earth elements, such as Sb or Te.6 The exploitation of rare natural reserves makes
such technology unsustainable. Therefore, it remains important to
develop versatile thermoelectric materials from earth-abundant and
eco-friendly constituent elements using scalable nanoparticle synthesis
techniques and subsequent processing into bulk structures using facile
methodologies.

Materials scientists have been exploring a wide
range of cost-effective
and eco-friendly materials that can be used in thermoelectric applications.
Quaternary semiconductor copper zinc tin sulfide (Cu2ZnSnS4, CZTS) is one such material that has been widely explored
for use in solar cells and has the ability to behave as a thermoelectric
material because of its low κ and high S.7 Undoped CZTS achieved a ZT value
of 0.026 at 700 K.8 Interestingly, Cu-doped
CZTS (Cu2.19Zn0.80Sn0.75S3.53) exhibited a ZT value of 0.14 at 700 K, which is
5 times higher than that of stoichiometric CZTS, even though this ZT value is still low.8 The low ZT value of CZTS is mainly caused by its low σ.7 To improve the thermoelectric properties of CZTS,
Zn atoms have been substituted with other transition-metal atoms and/or
S atoms have been substituted with Se atoms using various techniques
including solid-state reaction, mechanical alloying, and wet chemical
synthesis.9−12 The results obtained by such modifications of CZTS are promising,
for example, ZT = 0.86 (at 800 K) for Cu2.2Zn0.8SnSe4,13ZT = 0.7 (at 850 K) for Cu2CoSnSe4 at 850 K,14ZT = 0.71
(at 685 K) for Cu2.15Cd0.85SnSe3.9 at 685 K,15 and ZT =
0.6 (at 800 K) for Cu2.1Mn0.9SnSe4.16 In addition, by replacing S with Se
and Sn with Ge, the ZT value has also been markedly
enhanced. For instance, ZT = 0.55 (at 723 K) for
Cu2.15Zn0.85GeSe3.917 and ZT = 0.45 (at 670 K) for Cu2.075Zn0.925GeSe4.18 However,
these materials are no longer CZTS, and most of them contain rarer
and more toxic elements than CZTS.

Recently, we reported that
the ZT value of Zn-doped
Cu2SnS3 (Cu2Sn1–xZnxS3)19 could be dramatically enhanced up to 0.64 (at
670 K) by multiscale defect engineering.20 This result suggests that the thermoelectric performance of existing
systems can be substantially improved by controlling atomic structural
properties such as lattice defects and nonstoichiometry along with
impurities, nanostructure, and mesoscale structure. Therefore, multiscale
defect engineering represents a new possibility to improve the ZT values of materials composed of sustainable elements
with inferior thermoelectric performance.

Pan and co-workers
synthesized wurtzite Cu3InSnS5 (CITS) nanocrystals,
which belong to the I3–III–IV–VI5 family (a new generation of copper-based quaternary semiconductor),
for solar cell applications.21 However,
the scarcity of In will limit the practical use of CITS materials.
Bai et al.22 recently reported that Cu3AlSnS5 (CATS) is a sustainable I3–III–IV–VI5 semiconductor that may be suitable as an alternative to CITS.
In a nod to the materials described above, in this study, we attempt
to synthesize Cu3Zn1–xAlxSnS5–y nanocrystals as building blocks for sustainable thermoelectric
materials by revisiting materials based on Cu, Zn, Sn, and S. Note
that Cu3ZnSnS5–y differs
from conventional CZTS. The reason why Al is incorporated into Cu–Zn–Sn–S
nanocrystals is that ab initio calculations predicted that the incorporation
of Al into the I–IV–VI system may cause κlat to decrease.23

Results and Discussion
Morphology
and Crystal Structure of Nanocrystals
Cu3Zn1–xAlxSnS5–y (x = 0–1)
nanocrystals with five different compositions were
synthesized, which are referred to as Powder_0, Powder_0.25, Powder_0.5, Powder_0.75, and Powder_1 corresponding to x =
0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1, respectively. Depending on x, y could vary to maintain electroneutrality of
the system. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the as-synthesized
nanocrystals are shown in Figure 1. All nanocrystals were uniform in size and shape with
a hexagonal pencil-like morphology (several nanocrystals are standing
up and others are lying down on the TEM grid). Average lengths and
widths of nanocrystals are shown in Figure 1f, which indicates that the nanocrystal size
decreases with increasing Al content. Because the nanocrystal size
fundamentally depends on nucleation and growth as well as adsorption/desorption
processes,24 one plausible reason for the
decrease in nanocrystal size with increasing x is
the low affinity between Al and 1-dodecanethiol (DDT) compared to
that between Zn and DDT.25 This phenomenon
can be explained by the hard/soft-acid/base principle. Namely, the
sulfide (DDT) is a soft base and Cu, Zn, and Al are soft, moderate,
and hard acids, respectively.

0.25, (c)
0.5, (d) 0.75, and (e) 1. (f) Average length and width of the nanocrystals
plotted as a function of x.

The Cu/Zn/Al/Sn atomic ratios for Powder_0, Powder_0.25, Powder_0.5, Powder_0.75, and Powder_1 were determined to be 59:22:0:19, 57:17:6:20,
62:9:9:20, 63:5:14:18, and 63:0:19:18, respectively, by scanning electron
microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) analysis,
which are approximately equal to the nominal compositions of Cu3Zn1–xAlxSnS5–y with x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1, respectively. To determine the oxidation
states of elements in the nanocrystals, core-level X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of Powder_1 was performed. Figure S1 shows Cu 2p, Al 2p, Sn 3d, and S 2p
spectra obtained for this sample. The binding energies of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 were 932.2 and 952.1 eV, respectively.
The peak separation of 19.9 eV is indicative of the presence of Cu+. The peak from Al 2p3/2 appeared at the binding
energy of 74.6 eV, which was assigned to Al3+. The presence
of Sn4+ was confirmed by the observation of peaks at 486.4
eV (3d5/2) and 494.8 eV (3d3/2) with a characteristic
peak separation of 8.4 eV. The presence of S2– was
confirmed by the peaks located at 161.5 eV (2p3/2) and
162.6 eV (2p1/2) with a peak splitting of 1.1 eV, which
was consistent with the literature value for metal sulfides.22

Figure 2 shows the
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Powder_0, Powder_0.5, and Powder_1. The XRD patterns of Powder_0.25 and Powder_0.75 are provided in Figure S2. Rietveld refinement of the XRD patterns was performed
with the FullProf program26 using wurtzite
(WZ) and zinc blende (ZB) ZnS crystallographic information files.27 Simulated patterns in which Cu, Sn, and Al ions
randomly substitute Zn sites in the ZnS structure are shown as black
lines, and occupancy parameters are listed in Table S1. The crystal structures of Powder_0, Powder_0.25, Powder_0.5, Powder_0.75, and Powder_1 are presented in Figure S3.

Figure 2 Rietveld refinement of powder XRD patterns of (a) Powder_0, (b) Powder_0.5, and (c) Powder_1. The
experimental patterns are shown as red lines, and the calculated patterns
are shown as black lines. The Bragg reflection positions are shown
as short green bars below the diffraction patterns. The blue lines
represent difference patterns.

Rietveld refinement revealed that the primary crystal structure
of all nanocrystals was WZ with small amounts of ZB (Table S2). The fraction of ZB probably varied because the
difference in the oxidation states of Zn2+ and Al3+ altered the degree of electrostatic interactions in the samples,
yielding different crystal structures.28 The mean crystalline size (Dxrd) was
calculated with the Scherrer equation using the primary peak of the
WZ phase. Dxrd values calculated for Powder_0, Powder_0.25, Powder_0.5, Powder_0.75, and Powder_1 were 12.6,
12.4, 12.8, 12.4, and 9.1 nm, respectively. The as-synthesized nanocrystals
were further analyzed by high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM
(HAADF-STEM), as shown in Figure 3. Lattice fringes that were ascribed to the {100} planes
of WZ were clearly seen in all cases. To confirm that all elements
are within each nanocrystal, EDS elemental mapping was carried out
for Cu3ZnSnS5–y, Cu3Zn0.5Al0.5SnS5–y and Cu3AlSnS5 nanocrystals as shown
in Figure S4.

spacing of 0.33–0.38 nm are ascribed to the {100} planes of
WZ.

Crystal Structure of Pellets
Pellets were fabricated
from the powder samples. The pellets fabricated from Powder_0, Powder_0.25, Powder_0.5, Powder_0.75, and Powder_1 are referred to as Pellet_0, Pellet_0.25, Pellet_0.5, Pellet_0.75, and Pellet_1, respectively. The measured Cu/Zn/Al/Sn
atomic ratios for Pellet_0, Pellet_0.25, Pellet_0.5, Pellet_0.75, and Pellet_1 were 59:21:0:20, 58:17:7:18, 61:9:9:21, 60:6:16:18, and 61:0:22:17,
respectively, which were approximately equal to the nominal compositions
of Cu3Zn1–xAlxSnS5–y with x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1, respectively. The measured
densities of Pellet_0, Pellet_0.25, Pellet_0.5, Pellet_0.75, and Pellet_1 were 4.522, 4.531, 4.518, 4.544, and 4.356 g·cm–3, respectively. Thus, the relative densities of all pellets were
higher than 95%.

Figure 4a–e shows XRD patterns of the pellets. To perform quantitative
phase-composition analysis of the pellets, Rietveld refinement of
their XRD patterns was performed. Figure 4f shows the weight percentage of the WZ phase
in each pellet. A phase transition from WZ to ZB was clearly observed
for all pellets during sintering. Specifically, Pellet_0 consisted of a pure ZB phase after sintering. The
phase transition was ascribed to the greater thermodynamic stability
of the ZB phase than that of the WZ phase because of the more symmetrical
structure of the former, which might increase with the Zn content
and thereby facilitate the phase transition. The lattice constants
of the ZB phase are plotted as a function of x in Figure S5. The calculated Dxrd values of Pellet_0, Pellet_0.25, Pellet_0.5, Pellet_0.75, and Pellet_1 were 22.7, 20.2, 21.5, 17.7, and 19.8 nm, respectively, indicating
that Dxrd slightly increased during sintering
for all the pellets.

and
calculated patterns are shown as red and black lines, respectively.

Thermoelectric Properties
Figure 5 shows the
thermoelectric properties of Pellet_0, Pellet_0.25, Pellet_0.5, Pellet_0.75, and Pellet_1. Thermal diffusivities
and specific heats for all pellets are provided in Figure S6. As shown in Figure 5a, σ decreases with temperature, indicating the
metallic behavior of the pellets. It is noteworthy that the σ
values of Pellet_1 are an order of magnitude higher than
those of the other pellets as well as those of other high-performance
copper sulfide-based thermoelectric materials including Cu1.97S,29 Cu10Ni2Sb4S13,30 and Cu26V2Sn6S32.31

undoped CZTS (unfilled black circles),8 and Cu-doped CZTS (filled black circles).8 The inset of (d) shows κlat plotted with respect
to the reciprocal of temperature.

It is interesting to compare the thermoelectric properties of our
samples with those of reported CZTS materials8 (Figure S7). Cu-doped CZTS (Cu2.19Zn0.80Sn0.75S3.53) exhibited
a σ value that was 38 times higher than that of undoped CZTS
at 700 K (Figure S7a). The atomic fraction
of Cu in our pellet samples was higher than that in Cu-doped CZTS,
and the σ values of our pellets were much higher than that of
Cu-doped CZTS, as shown in Figure S7a.

Figure 5b illustrates
the temperature dependence of S. In general, S depends inversely on σ. However, the S values of Pellet_0, Pellet_0.25, Pellet_0.5, and Pellet_0.75 are approximately
the same as that of Cu-doped CZTS (Figure S7b), even though the σ values of these pellets are much higher
than that of Cu-doped CZTS, resulting in our pellets displaying much
higher PF values than those of CZTS materials. Though it is not appropriate
to directly compare the electrical transport properties of the Cu3Zn1–xAlxSnS5–y materials, which
are I3–II/III–IV–VI5 semiconductors
with the ZB structure, with those of conventional CZTS materials,
which are I2–II–IV–VI4 semiconductors
with the tetragonal crystal structure, we would like to emphasize
that the electrical transport properties of Cu3Zn1–xAlxSnS5–y materials differ markedly from those of CZTS materials.
It should be noted that we measured S and σ
in both heating and cooling cycles and found that the values coincided
in both types of cycles (Figure S8).

Figure 5c displays
the temperature dependence of κ. The κ values are quite
low for all pellets except for Pellet_1, and κ
shows almost no temperature dependence. This is more evident in Figure S7c,d, where κlat of
undoped CZTS exhibits the classical 1/T dependence
caused by the Umklapp scattering, whereas the characteristic 1/T dependence of κlat completely disappeared
for the Cu3Zn1–xAlxSnS5–y materials, indicating that the phonon scattering is dominated by
defect scattering including nanograins and lattice distortion. In
addition, the κlat values decreased with increasing x, as expected. The reason for the disappearance of the
1/T dependence of κlat in the case
of Cu-doped CZTS has been explained by lattice distortion generated
by excess Cu dopants occupying Zn positions in the lattice.8

Figure 5e,f shows
the temperature dependences of PF and ZT values,
respectively. Pellet_0 and Pellet_0.5 exhibited ZT values of 0.39 (at 658 K) and 0.40 (at 666 K), respectively;
these values are approximately 15 and 3 times higher than the ZT values (at 700 K) of undoped and Cu-doped CZTS materials,8 respectively. The ZT value of Pellet_1 was only 0.12 (at 668 K), which was mainly due to Pellet_1 having a high σ, resulting in the high carrier
thermal conductivity (κcar) (Figure S9). Therefore, there is a high possibility of improvement
of the ZT value of CATS materials by lowering σ
to decrease κcar because κlat of
CATS is already quite low (∼0.3 W m–1 K–1), as shown in Figure 5d. The decrease of σ can be achieved in several
ways; for example, incorporating nanoinclusions in the material to
scatter carriers or decreasing the size of nanocrystals.

Pellet_0 (Cu3ZnSnS5–y) consisted of a pure ZB phase accompanied with high S compared to those of metals and high σ compared
to those of intrinsic semiconductors, implying that Pellet_0 is a degenerate semiconductor. In contrast, Pellet_0.25, Pellet_0.5, Pellet_0.75, and Pellet_1 consisted of mixtures of ZB and WZ phases. The weight percentage
of the WZ phase increased with the Al content, as shown in Figure 4f. The S and σ values of the pellets at 375 and 650 K are summarized
in Table S3 as well as the weight percentages
of ZB and WZ phases of all pellets. Both S and σ
exhibited complex behavior with respect to x, indicating
that the fraction of the ZB phase has a noticeable effect on the electrical
transport properties of the pellets. Even though the amount of data
was insufficient, one could argue that the carrier concentration of
Cu3Zn1–xAlxSnS5–y materials
seems to increase with the Al content if one compares the characteristics
of Pellet_0.25 and Pellet_0.5 or Pellet_0.75 and Pellet_1, which have similar weight percentages
of the ZB phase (Table S3). To confirm
this hypothesis, based on the free electron model, Fermi energy EF can be described as 1  where ℏ is the Dirac constant, kF = (3π2n)1/3 is the
wavenumber at the Fermi surface, and n is the carrier
concentration. We assumed that an acoustic phonon
scattering of carriers is dominant at the high-temperature region.
According to this assumption, S can be described
as below 2   3  where A is the arbitrary
constant, ε is the energy, γ is the scattering parameter, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and e is the elementary charge. When the carrier scattering is dominated
by acoustic phonon scattering, γ = −1/2. From eqs 1–3, the values of n and mobility (μ)
were estimated as shown in Table S4. The
value of μ is low for all pellets as compared to typical semiconductors
probably because of the defect scattering. These results create opportunity
for finer tuning of the material physical properties contributing
toward better understanding of their thermoelectric performances.

Conclusions
A novel series of thermoelectric materials was
chemically synthesized
with earth-abundant and eco-friendly elements. Incorporation of Al
in the Cu–Zn–Sn–S system decreased κlat by about 4 times and enhanced σ by an order of magnitude
at most. In consequence, Cu3Zn1–xAlxSnS5–y (x = 0 and 0.5) materials exhibited ZT values of 0.39 (at 658 K) and 0.40 (at 666 K), respectively,
which are approximately 15 times higher than that of conventional
CZTS. It was challenging to determine the most important factor to
control the ZT value because incorporation of Al
changed not only the material stoichiometry but also the phase fraction
and crystal structure and their dependent parameters. This research
contributes to the development of Cu–Zn/Al–Sn–S-based
semiconductors as sustainable thermoelectric materials and creates
space for further development of a profound understanding of transport
properties and ZT values without sacrificing sustainability.

Experimental
Section
Synthesis of Cu3Zn1–xAlxSnS5–y Nanocrystals
DDT (purity 99%), oleylamine (OAM, purity
70%), copper(II) acetate hydrate [Cu(OAc)2, purity 98%],
zinc(II) acetylacetonate hydrate [Zn(acac)2, purity 99.995%],
and tin(II) acetate [Sn(OAc)2] were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
Japan. All chemicals were used without any further purification.

Cu3ZnSnS5–y nanocrystals
were synthesized as follows. Cu(OAc)2 (5 mmol), Sn(OAc)2 (2 mmol), Zn(acac)2 (1 mmol), OAM (100 mL), and
DDT (100 mL) were added to a three-necked flask equipped with a dry
Ar inlet/outlet, trap sphere, condenser, heating mantle, thermocouple,
and magnetic stirrer. First, the reaction mixture was stirred with
Ar bubbling at room temperature for 5 min. Then, the temperature was
increased to 100 °C and kept there for 10 min with Ar bubbling
to remove volatile matter. Subsequently, the reaction temperature
was further raised to 260 °C and held there for 1 h. After cooling
the reaction mixture, the nanocrystals were separated from the reaction
mixture by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 3 min. The nanocrystals
were then washed three times by repeating the following purification
cycle: redispersion in hexane, centrifugation, and supernatant decantation.
Finally, the obtained nanocrystals were dried under vacuum. Cu3Zn1–xAlxSnS5–y nanocrystals were
also synthesized in a similar manner by varying the input molar ratio
of aluminum acetylacetonate [Al(acac)3, purity 99%] (x) to Zn(acac)2 while keeping the total amount
of those two precursors constant [Al(acac)3 + Zn(acac)2 = 1 mmol].

Ligand Exchange
Thiourea (TU; Tokyo
Chemical Industry,
10 g) was dissolved in methanol (Kanto Chemical, 400 mL). The TU solution
was added to a dispersion of the nanocrystals (3.4 g) in toluene (250
mL). The mixture was sonicated for 1 h at room temperature. After
the ligand exchange reaction, TU-capped nanocrystals were separated
from the solution by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 3 min. The TU-capped
nanocrystals were washed by redispersion in a hexane/toluene mixture,
centrifugation, and supernatant decantation. The TU-capped nanocrystals
were redispersed in methanol (400 mL), and then toluene (125 mL) was
added. The dispersion was subjected to centrifugation at 5000 rpm
for 10 min to remove excess TU.

Pelletization
After ligand exchange, nanocrystals were
pelletized into a solid disk with a diameter of 10 mm and a thickness
of 2–3 mm using a pulsed electric current sintering machine
(Sinterland LABOX-100) under the following conditions: vacuum, 3.5
Pa; temperature, 450 °C; pelletization pressure, 30 MPa; and
sintering time, 5 min. The pellets fabricated from Powder_0, Powder_0.25, Powder_0.5, Powder_0.75, and Powder_1 are referred to as Pellet_0, Pellet_0.25, Pellet_0.5, Pellet_0.75, and Pellet_1, respectively. The pellets were polished
using silicon carbide abrasive paper (grit size 2000) before characterization.
The densities of pellets were determined using a gas pycnometer (Shimadzu
AccuPyc II 1340).

Structural and Compositional Analyses
The synthesized
nanocrystals were characterized by TEM (Hitachi H-7650 operated at
100 kV), XRD using a Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer with Cu Kα
radiation, STEM equipped with a HAADF detector and an EDS system (JEOL
JEM-ARM200F operated at 200 kV), SEM (Hitachi TM3030) equipped with
an EDS system, and XPS (Shimadzu Kratos AXIS-ULTRA DLD). The pellets
were characterized by XRD and SEM/EDS.

Measurement of Thermoelectric
Properties
First, κ
was measured for the pellets in the cross-plane direction by laser
flash analysis (Netzsch LFA457). In this method, κ (W m–1 K–1) was calculated as κ
= dcD, where d (kg m–3), c (J kg–1 K–1), and D (m2 s–1) are
the density, specific heat, and thermal diffusivity of the pellet,
respectively. Then, S and electrical resistivity
(ρ) were measured in the in-plane direction by a ZEM-3 analyzer
(ULVAC-Riko). The carrier thermal conductivity, κcar, was calculated as κcar = LσT – PF·T, where L denotes the Lorentz number (2.44 × 10–8 W
Ω K–2). Then, κlat was calculated
as κlat = κ – κcar.
The ZT value was calculated as ZT = σS2T/κ.
