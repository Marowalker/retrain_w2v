The
rapid growth of structural information for G-protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs) has led to a greater understanding of their structure,
function, selectivity, and ligand binding. Although novel ligands
have been identified using methods such as virtual screening, computationally
driven lead optimization has been possible only in isolated cases
because of challenges associated with predicting binding free energies
for related compounds. Here, we provide a systematic characterization
of the performance of free-energy perturbation (FEP) calculations
to predict relative binding free energies of congeneric ligands binding
to GPCR targets using a consistent protocol and no adjustable parameters.
Using the FEP+ package, first we validated the protocol, which includes
a full lipid bilayer and explicit solvent, by predicting the binding
affinity for a total of 45 different ligands across four different
GPCRs (adenosine A2AAR, β1 adrenergic,
CXCR4 chemokine, and δ opioid receptors). Comparison with experimental
binding affinity measurements revealed a highly predictive ranking
correlation (average spearman ρ = 0.55) and low root-mean-square
error (0.80 kcal/mol). Next, we applied FEP+ in a prospective project,
where we predicted the affinity of novel, potent adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) antagonists. Four novel compounds were
synthesized and tested in a radioligand displacement assay, yielding
affinity values in the nanomolar range. The affinity of two out of
the four novel ligands (plus three previously reported compounds)
was correctly predicted (within 1 kcal/mol), including one compound
with approximately a tenfold increase in affinity compared to the
starting compound. Detailed analyses of the simulations underlying
the predictions provided insights into the structural basis for the
two cases where the affinity was overpredicted. Taken together, these
results establish a protocol for systematically applying FEP+ to GPCRs
and provide guidelines for identifying potent molecules in drug discovery
lead optimization projects.

Introduction
Since the release of
the first G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)
crystal structure in 2000,1 research has
shifted toward structure-based studies on these pharmaceutically relevant
proteins.2 Indeed, between 2014 and 2016
more than a dozen novel, unique crystal structures have been reported,
including multiple class B and two class C GPCRs.3 These crystal structures facilitate the understanding of
the structural basis of ligand binding, selectivity, and receptor
function.4 Additionally, they function
as starting points for structure-based computational studies including
virtual screening.5

One of the major
hurdles in drug discovery in terms of costs is
lead optimization.6 Computer-aided drug
design (CADD) provides valuable tools for hit and lead discovery;
however, the added value of CADD techniques in terms of predicting
binding affinity in lead optimization has traditionally been modest.7 Virtual screening methods often perform well
in terms of distinguishing weak and strong binders from inactive or
decoy compounds but do not allow quantitative prediction of affinity
for a congeneric series.8 On the other
hand, more rigorous free-energy calculation methods like free-energy
perturbation (FEP) and thermodynamic integration (TI) have the promise
of accurately predicting the free energy of binding, but applications
to drive discovery have been limited due to uncertainties about the
accuracy of force fields, insufficient sampling, time-consuming setup,
and significant computational demands.9 In addition, the application of rigorous free-energy methods to
GPCRs is perhaps more challenging in many cases than soluble enzyme
targets because of the lipid bilayer, buried waters, binding-site
flexibility, and other complicating factors.

With the recent
advances in improved force fields for proteins
and small molecules10 together with the
development of more efficient sampling strategies, such as replica
exchange, orthogonal space tempering, and replica exchange with solute
tempering (REST),11 accurate and reliable
predictions of protein–ligand binding free energies have been
achieved.9a,12 Furthermore, general-purpose graphics processing
units (GPGPUs or GPUs) have significantly improved the performance
and cost of running simulations compared to those in traditional central
processing unit (CPU) clusters. Indeed, it is now possible to get
more than 200-fold speedup in running molecular dynamics simulations
on a single GPU compared to a single CPU. The combination of improved
force fields, enhanced sampling methods, and GPU computing has made
FEP an attractive approach for lead optimizations in drug discovery
projects. Prospective applications of FEP have been successful in
a number of cases, such as predicting one of the most potent non-nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors,13 including
those that show activity toward mutant strains,14 inhibitors of the macrophage migration inhibitory factor,15 and drug-like inhibitors for IRAK4 and TYK2.9a

In the past, several FEP studies have
been conducted on GPCR homology
models, usually to validate the model by making changes to the protein
or to the ligand and predicting the effect.16 Additional studies have used crystal structures of GPCRs to study
the influence of in silico mutagenesis on agonist- and antagonist-bound
structures of A2AR,17 to rationalize
the difference in binding affinity for a fragment,18 or to explain the structure–activity relationship
(SAR) on JDTic, a κ-opioid receptor (KOP) antagonist.19 However, a systematic validation of FEP calculations
against multiple GPCRs with different ligand series has not yet been
performed.

In this study, we have evaluated the performance
of FEP+,9a a recently developed workflow
for large-scale
application of FEP, to a dataset of 45 ligands against four different
class A GPCRs. Motivated by the promising retrospective performance,
we also applied FEP+ in a prospective fashion. The affinity of 46
derivatives was predicted for the A2AR, and four novel
compounds were synthesized, leading to the discovery of a compound
with approximately tenfold increase in affinity. These results further
validate the applicability of FEP+ for lead optimization across a
wide range of target classes, including membrane-bound proteins.

Results
and Discussion
Overall Results
Our application
of FEP+ relies on a
previously published workflow9a adopted
to accommodate membrane proteins such as GPCRs (see Experimental). Because we were particularly interested in
the performance of this workflow on different class A GPCRs, we selected
SAR series ranging from 9 to 11 compounds each for four different
targets (Figures S1–S5, Supporting
Information). Targets were selected on the basis of (a) the quality
of the crystal structure and (b) the availability of a series of congeneric
compounds similar to the crystal structure ligand. Whereas FEP+ performance
for all targets studied was in line with what was observed for globular
proteins reported in a previous publication, the results for the A2AR were particularly promising. Before applying FEP+ in a
prospective fashion to the A2AR, we first performed additional
validation using a secondary set of molecules for this target. The
cumulative results shown in Figure 1 are based on a total of 90 perturbations among 45
compounds. Overall, the FEP+ method performance against these GPCR
series is comparable with the studies on non-membrane-bound proteins.9a Indeed, 39 out of the 45 compounds were predicted
within 1 kcal/mol error of the experimental affinity. This is also
indicated by the low RMSE of the experimental versus predicted affinities
(0.80 kcal/mol) and the high ranking correlation coefficient (Spearman
ρ), which was calculated for every dataset individually and
weighted by the number of compounds for the total average value that
we report (ρ = 0.55). Similarly, the weighted mean unsigned
error (MUE) was calculated on the basis of raw data and weighted for
every dataset individually by the number of perturbations. The weighted
ρ of 0.55 (minimum: 0.2, maximum: 0.83) and a weighted MUE of
0.94 kcal/mol (minimum: 0.58 kcal/mol, maximum: 1.56 kcal/mol) indicate
significant predictive capabilities and high accuracy. The performance
quality appeared to be target-dependent, with a range from satisfactory
to excellent results for four out of five targets. The reasons for
the system dependence are further discussed in the next section.

compounds. Compounds are labeled with their compound names and colored

with a slope of 1. The gray lines represent the 1 kcal/mol error line.
The weighted average ranking correlation coefficient (weighted Spearman
ρ) was calculated using the ranking correlation coefficient
for every dataset individually and weighting by the dataset size.
The root-mean-square deviation was calculated on the individual ΔG values. Finally, the average weighted MUE was calculated
on the raw data (ΔΔG values) and weighted
by the number of perturbations for each dataset.

Results by Target
The results for each individual target
are shown in Table 1 and Figures S1–S5, demonstrating
significant target dependence (see Figures S6–S10). The MUE ranged from 0.58 kcal/mol (A2AR) to 1.56 kcal/mol
(CXCR4) and the coefficient of determination (R),
from 0.39 (β1-adrenergic receptor, β1AR) to 0.85 (δ opioid receptor, DOP). The R-value, as a general rule, is highly dependent on dataset size and
potency span, with smaller potency spans resulting in low correlations,
even if predictions approached experimental accuracy/uncertainty.
The dependence of this correlation on the dynamic range of the data
has been covered in detail previously.9a,20 Indeed, the
low MUE indicates accurate performance of FEP+ on these ligands/targets,
but datasets with small experimental dynamic ranges of binding affinities
can result in low R values, even when the MUE is
low. A more meaningful measure is to compare the observed R with an expected R resulting from assuming
an expected prediction error of 1.1 kcal/mol. For all cases, expect
for the CXCR4, the observed correlation coefficient (R) is comparable with the expected R for the given
range in experimental affinity. For the weighted average, we obtained
the same values (0.62) for the observed and expected R. Some datasets performed better than average; for the A2AR and DOP receptor, the observed R between the FEP-predicted
binding free energies and experimental data was somewhat larger than
expected. In addition, smaller dataset sizes result in more variability
in the computed statistics, which could explain the cases where the R-value is better than expected.

the Chemokine receptor CXCR4, the minimum affinity was set to −6.81
kcal/mol (asterisk, see the text).

b As a validation metric, the correlation
(R) is given for both FEP and MM-GBSA. The MUE was
calculated for FEP based on the ΔΔG data.

c The expected R was
calculated by assuming an RMSE of 1.1 kcal/mol in the calculations.20 The average correlation coefficient was weighted
by the dataset size.

To
compare FEP+ with a less computationally expensive method, we
also predicted affinity values using MM-GBSA. In this case, no significant
correlations were found except for the β1-adrenergic ligands49 (shown in Table 1 and Figures S6–S10).

The calculations of multiple perturbations for each ligand,
as
determined using the FEP+ mapper algorithm, allow for the estimation
of sampling errors in the calculation through cycle closure analysis.12 Problematic calculations can a priori be identified
from high hysteresis values (Figures S1–S5, red arrows). For example, a number of cycles involving perturbation
of 11 to 41 for the A2AR were found to have a high hysteresis,
ranging between 1.34 and 2.11 kcal/mol. Indeed, this prediction had
a high absolute error of 2.52 kcal/mol. Consequently, when this perturbation
was excluded from the results, an increase in performance was observed
(R = 0.82, MUE = 0.57 kcal/mol). In the case of the
A2AR, perturbations involving compounds 32 and 41 had larger
errors than other perturbations. This was expected because compounds
32 and 41 have different cores than those of the other molecules and
a much large perturbation is required to mutate between compounds
32 or 41 and other ligands. If compounds 32 and 41 were omitted from
the analysis, the correlation (R) increased from
0.78 to 0.96 and the MUE decreased from 0.68 to 0.57 kcal/mol. The
SAR of these compounds has been studied previously using WaterMap,21 and although the results obtained in that study
were also predictive, they required an ad hoc correction to ligand
entropy for best performance.

Next, we validated the performance
on a second, related dataset22 for the
A2AR, to further assess if
FEP+ can be prospectively applied to this target. The correlation
for the isolated dataset was not high, which was expected given that
the affinities span less than 1 order of magnitude (Ki range: 7.5–64 nM). The MUE was in the same range
for both datasets (MUE between 0.58 and 0.68). These results demonstrate
that FEP+ can be applied successfully on two different datasets and,
by extension, possibly on novel derivatives of the A2AR.

For the DOP receptor, the performance was comparable with the results
we obtained for the A2AR. In fact, the observed R was 1 standard deviation higher than the expected R. For both the A2AR and DOP receptor, an exceptionally
high resolution crystal structure was used (1.8 Å) with most
water molecules resolved in both binding pockets, which may partially
explain why FEP+ performed so well on these targets.

For the
CXCR4, the performance was below the expected R and
the MUE was also relatively high (R, 0.45;
MUE, 1.56 kcal/mol). A few aspects of this dataset should be taken
into account (Figure S5). First, most of
the perturbations involved modifications at two or even three positions
of the ligand and were relatively large in size compared to those
of the other series and what has been previously attempted.9a Moreover, the experimental affinity of compound
1d was set to 10 000 nM (ΔG = −6.81
kcal/mol), whereas the true affinity was reported to be over 10 000
nM.23 Finally, it should be noted that
these thiourea compounds can adopt different tautomeric states, and
in this FEP+ map, only one tautomer was considered. Despite these
relatively high errors, it was still encouraging to see that FEP+
was able to predict several large perturbations, like 1d to 1c (isopropyl
to cyclopentyl) and 1g to 1t (cycloheptyl to cyclohexyl), correctly
(Figure S5).

Because of the relatively
poor resolution of the β1AR crystal structure (>2.5
Å), which resulted in a structure
with no buried binding-site waters, we included water molecules from
a WaterMap simulation (see Experimental).
WaterMap has recently been shown to be a useful tool for placing waters
in structures for which the resolution is relatively low.24 Comparisons with experimental results revealed
a relatively high MUE compared to that of the A2AR and
DOP receptor; however, the observed MUE still falls within the range
of previously reported errors for this method.9a

At the time of writing, an updated version of OPLS
force field
was released (OPLS3).10b Therefore, we
repeated the same perturbations using OPLS3 (Table S2). In most cases, the MUE was in line with the results obtained
with OPLS2.1, with a slightly higher MUE value for OPLS3 in three
of the four cases. On the other hand, hysteresis values were lower
for OPLS3, possibly due to the improved protein parameters.10b Therefore, we used the OPLS3 force field to
determine the origin of the overpredicted compounds (see section “Overprediction of compounds 11 and 17”).

Prospective Results: Computational Setup
We further
validated the performance of FEP+ prospectively, by predicting the
affinity of 46 potential new derivatives of the Minetti et al. compounds25 (Table S3). These
compounds were designed to cover a wide range of synthetically accessible
substitutions. Affinities were predicted by perturbing two reference
compounds into each derivative. These results were then merged with
the retrospective map for the Minetti et al. dataset. We excluded
compounds 32 and 41 from these results because of a different core
of the molecule (see section Results by Target). Approximately 12 perturbations
per week were completed on four Nvidia-780GTX graphic cards. Therefore,
these prospective calculations can typically be completed within 1
week using 32 GPUs. This throughput is slightly lower than that in
the previous study, which is a consequence of the system being slightly
larger compared to the globular proteins studied previously, because
of the presence of a membrane around the GPCR. Recently, a new version
of Desmond has been released (version 4.4)26 that has a 2-fold speedup on GPUs compared to that in the version
used here, making these calculations even more accessible for prospective
application to live projects.

Experimental Results
On the basis of the FEP+ calculations
of the 46 A2AR derivatives, four novel derivatives were
selected for synthesis. Three of these were predicted to have high
affinity, and one, compound 13 (VC-28), served as a negative
control. We further checked the predicted affinities of these four
test cases by perturbing them into all experimentally tested reference
compounds from Minetti et al. (Figure 2; Table S3). In addition
to these novel compounds, we resynthesized three reference compounds
tested before by Minetti et al. (1–3) to ensure that the affinities were comparable between labs (Figure 2).25

Figure 2 Predicted affinities for the 46 potential derivatives (Table S3) and 7 Minetti et al.25 compounds using the 4EIY PDB structure for the FEP+ simulations.
Compounds highlighted in orange are Minetti et al. compounds, and
compounds in dark blue represent the newly synthesized derivatives
(top half of figure). The numbered compounds are all compounds that
were synthesized, including the three compounds that have been described
previously (3/25d, 1/25b, and 2/25e). The predicted and experimental ΔG are
given; previously determined experimental ΔG’s are highlighted in orange. The error shows the difference
in predicted vs experimental ΔG.

The four new compounds were synthesized from previously
described
purine derivatives. Namely, 6-chloro-2-iodo-9-methyl-9H-purine (4) was reacted with cyclohexylacetylene in
a Sonogashira coupling to afford 2-alkynylated derivative 5, which in turn was treated with ammonia to yield adenine (6). Hydrogenation of the alkyne afforded alkyl derivative 7, which was then brominated and immediately reacted with
1,2,3-triazole to yield compound 8. Alternatively, 4 was aminated at the 6-position to afford iodoadenine (9), which was then brominated and reacted with 1,2,3-triazole
to yield iodo derivative 10. 10 was then
reacted into a molybdenum-catalyzed aminocarbonylation reaction with
aniline, with the catalyst Mo(CO)6 also serving as a source
of CO; this afforded benzamide derivative 11 (Schemes 1–3). 12 was reacted with dimethylamine to afford compound 13. Finally, dichloropurine 14 was diaminated,
and the resulting compound 15 was submitted to the bromination/triazole
coupling sequence, the product of which was reacted with benzoyl chloride
to afford the 2-mono-acylated derivative 17. The synthesized
compounds were further tested for affinity in a radioligand binding
assay for the A2AR. (Figures S11 and S12).

The differences between the experimental
values obtained here (Figure 2, blue) and in the
previous study25 (Figure 2, orange) were 0.45 kcal/mol on average.
The largest difference was found for 3 with a difference
of 0.71 kcal/mol between two experimental values, which is comparatively
high but falls within the heterogeneous experimental uncertainty.27 These control compounds indicated that we were
able to reproduce the affinities found by Minetti et al.25 The negative control was also in line with the
experimental result, with significantly reduced affinity compared
to that of the potent Minetti et al. compounds.

Compound 8, which was predicted to be significantly
more potent than 1, was in fact the most potent derivative
(Ki = 1.2 nM) of all of the compounds
tested here. The affinity was improved by approximately 10-fold over
the most potent compound in the Minetti series, which was compound 1 with an affinity of 10.7 nM (−10.87 kcal/mol). However,
the predicted values for the benzamide, compound 17,
and the inverted benzamide, compound 11, deviated from
what was found experimentally. Compound 17 in particular
was overpredicted by 3.75 kcal/mol, which is significantly higher
than the largest error observed in the retrospective data (2.11 kcal/mol
for the perturbation of 11 to 41).

Overpredictions of Compounds 11 and 17
The overprediction of the
affinity of compounds 11 and 17 urged us
to further analyze simulations involving
these compounds. Although large errors can occur occasionally, they
are quite rare, happening only in about 3.3% of the perturbations
for the previously reported dataset.9a This
overprediction could be due to several reasons, such as (1) unconverged
binding site hydration patterns, (2) multiple compound binding modes,
(3) large inaccuracies in the force field,9d or (4) incorrect system setup. On the basis of further analysis
of the complex (bound) FEP+ simulations, we observed that the amide
of compound 17 was able to form an interaction with Glu169EL2 mediated through different water molecules (Figure 3). This interaction was stabilized
by His2647.29, which was treated as a protonated species
as predicted by the PROPKA algorithm28 in
the Protein Preparation Wizard (Figure 4).29 To further test the
influence of the ionizable residues and the impact of these residues
on the predicted affinities, we selected another crystal structure
of the A2AR that was co-crystallized with the same ligand
(ZM241385, PDB: 3PWH)30 but solved at a higher pH (pH = 8–8.75,
instead of pH = 5 for 4EIY). When we compared the 4EIY with 3PWH structure, we found that for 3PWH extracellular loop
(EL) 3 is further away from EL2 with His2647.29 oriented
away from Glu169EL2 (Figure S13). Because of this structural difference, His2647.29 was
predicted to be deprotonated (HIE) in the 3PWH structure, in line with both the pH (∼8)
and pKa of the histidine (pKa = 6 – 6.5). His2647.29 has been shown
to be a residue that is involved in the dissociation of ZM241385.31 On the basis of this observation, we hypothesized
that the misassignment of the protonation state of His2647.29 and the conformation of EL3 were responsible for the overprediction
of compounds 11 and 17. They both contain
an amide that could interact more favorably with the protonated form
of His but would require an energetic cost to be paid to protonate
this His under the pH conditions in the experimental assays.

Figure 3 2D representation
of FEP+ simulation of replica 11 for ligand 17, showing
the percentage of time that an interaction is
present during the 5 ns simulation. One of the most prominent interactions
of the amide is the interaction with a bridging water that interacts
with Glu169EL2 and the oxygen of the amide.

Figure 4 Representative snapshot of replica 11 for ligand 17, at 3.36 ns. The interactions that are predicted to be
beneficial
among the receptor, the amide, the core of the molecule, and different
water molecules are shown. Two water molecules form bridging interactions
with the residue Glu169EL2. Moreover, the protonated His2647.29 stabilizes this interaction by forming an additional interaction
with Glu169EL2. For clarity, transmembrane (TM) helix 7
is partially hidden (residues 265–275). The membrane lipids
(POPC) are shown as spheres.

To enable a direct comparison between the two structures,
two FEP+
maps were generated for both crystal structures based on the seven
compounds that were synthesized in this work (Figures 2, S14, and S15). The predicted affinities for both are shown in Figure 5 (raw data in Table S4). The predictions based on the 3PWH crystal structure
correlated better with the experimental results (R 3PWH = 0.76, 4EIY = 0.44; MUE 3PWH = 1.24 kcal/mol, 4EIY = 2.33 kcal/mol).

Figure 5 Predicted
vs experimental ΔG for the seven
ligands based on either the crystal structure 3PWH or 4EIY. On the basis of
the difference between 4EIY and 3PWH predictions, we removed ligand 17 and then ligand 11. The red colored bars are predictions based on 4EIY, and the blue bars
are predictions based on 3PWH. The dashed bars represent predictions for both crystal
structures after removal of ligands 11 and 17. For instance, for ligand 4, the predicted ΔG based on all ligands is −10.51 kcal/mol, whereas the experimental
ΔG is −12.16 kcal/mol. After removal
of ligands 11 and 17, the predicted ΔG is −11.82 kcal/mol. Dashed lines represent a 1
kcal/mol error line.

This suggests an alternative mechanism for identifying erroneous
predictions a priori based only on the predicted affinities. If we
compare the differences between the predicted affinities (Figure 5 and ΔΔG4EIY-3PWH, Table S4), it is clear that the difference on
average is high (1.44 kcal/mol), resulting mostly from differences
for compounds 11 and 17. In a prospective
setting, when the experimental affinity is unknown, a second model
could be of use; predictions where two models predict significantly
different results should be deprioritized. For example, removing compounds 11 and 17 from both maps dramatically reduced
the average difference between the values in the two maps (from 1.44
to 0.87 kcal/mol), and there was a high correlation between the 4EIY- and 3PWH-based results (R = 0.82 between 4EIY and 3PWH), with 4EIY performing the best for the five remaining compounds (R24EIY = 0.96, 3PWH = 0.87). Although we were able to test this method only retrospectively
and on a small dataset, these results indicate that there is an added
value of validating predicted affinities using a second model or crystal
structure.

Conclusions
This study shows the
value that free-energy calculations (specifically,
FEP+) can have in GPCR drug discovery projects through the accurate
prediction of relative binding free energies for congeneric compounds.
The performance of free-energy methods had thus far only been studied
anecdotally for GPCRs; here we studied it on four different targets
involving different types of perturbations. Although the retrospective
results indicated that the results are target-dependent, the results
were still predictive and accurate for most targets, especially for
the Adenosine A2A and DOP receptors. Moreover, even for
some relatively large perturbations, good results were obtained, demonstrating
the robustness of this approach. These results were in line with those
that were previously obtained for globular proteins. Because these
calculations can be performed within in a matter of days, the real
strength of the approach is the accurate ranking of compounds for
synthesis. On the basis of FEP+ calculations, we predicted and identified
a highly potent antagonist (compound 8, Ki = 1.2 nM) and achieved a 10-fold increase in potency
by synthesizing only four compounds. Several predictions were incorrect,
including both compounds 11 and 17, where
we overpredicted the affinity. In that case, the cause of the erroneous
predictions was retrospectively identified by using a different crystal
structure. With the increase in the availability of crystal structures
for GPCRs, we expect that FEP+ will be applied in a more systematic
fashion, not only limited to predicting affinities of ligands but
also possibly to the prediction of selectivity of ligands.

Experimental
Section
Computational Setup
All calculations were performed
using tools available in the Schrodinger Suite.32 Structures were retrieved from the PDB33 and subsequently prepared using the Protein Preparation
Wizard.29 Protonation states were assigned
using PROPKA.28 For the A2AR
(PDB: 4EIY)
and the DOP receptor (PDB: 4N6H), the BRIL insertion was replaced by the wild-type
amino acids. For 4EIY, the first few amino acids of the crystal structure were mutated
back to the original sequence, to improve the stability of TM1 (GAPP
to MP). For the CXCR4 receptor (PDB: 3ODU), the T4 lysozyme was replaced by intracellular
loop 3. For the β1AR (PDB: 3ZPQ), the crystal structure
of piperazine-based fragment “19” was
used.34 The crystal structure used here
is a turkey β1AR, whereas the assay data is for the
human receptor. However, as human and turkey binding sites are 100%
identical, the results should be comparable.34 The model based on the crystal structure of 3PWH(30) was generated in the following way: residues that were
missing (e.g., EL2 149–158) were modeled using 4EIY, and we included
the water molecules and the sodium ion of the high-resolution crystal
structure (4EIY). For the calculations involving the OPLS3 force field (Table S2 and Figures S9 and S10), a newer release
of the Schrodinger software was used.26 MM-GBSA calculations were performed using Prime.35

After preparation, the structures were aligned to
the orientations from the Orientations of Proteins in Membranes (OPM)
database.36 Structures were embedded in
a membrane bilayer consisting of POPC lipids. SPC waters and counter
ions were added using the system builder from Desmond.37 The OPLS2.1 force field was used.10a,38 Additional missing torsion parameters of the reference and crystal
structure ligands were assigned using the force-field builder, which
refits the missing torsion parameters to an accurate QM calculation
(LMP2/cc-pVTZ(-f)). Virtual sites in OPLS2.1 were used for halogens
as described by Jorgensen et al.39 and
for heterocycles (the DOP receptor compounds). Implementation and
utilization of the force-field builder and virtual sites in OPLS3
have been recently described.10b

Because of the relatively low resolution of the β1AR structure (2.8 Å), additional water molecules were included
around the (unsubstituted) reference ligand “10”, using the WaterMap40 algorithm.
These waters were derived from the clustering of the water molecules
in the binding pocket sampled during the WaterMap trajectory.40 Subsequently, all systems were relaxed using
the default membrane-relaxation protocol implemented in multisim (Supporting Information).41 Because the ligands of both the A2AR and DOP receptor were similar but distinct from the crystal structure
ligand, the reference ligand was inserted using core-constrained docking.42 These docked poses were subjected to an additional multisim refinement of 2.5 ns (see Supporting Information). For both the β1AR and CXCR4,
a subset of ligands was selected from the original articles because
of the differences in the core and size of derivatives, respectively.
For simplicity, only the S-chiral form was considered
in the final results. For one ligand, experimental results were available
for both forms (e.g., 16b/16c). Calculated
ΔG for all stereoisomers can be found in the Table S1.

The individual perturbations
were generated using the FEP+ mapper.
Each ligand is connected to at least two other ligands, and the connections
represent the different perturbations performed (Figures 1–5). These maps were generated with a bias toward the reference ligand.
The same protocol used here has been described before.9a In brief, the FEP+ mapper sets up the individual
perturbations and builds the system for both the solvent and complex
simulations. After a short relaxation, 12 λ windows are simulated
under NPT conditions at 300 K for 5 ns. To further enhance sampling,
a “hot region” is assigned using REST.11d,43Figure 4 was rendered
using PyMol.44

Synthesis
All
reagents used were obtained from commercial
sources and all solvents were of analytical grade. Ethyl acetate (EtOAc)
was redistilled before use. Demineralized water is simply referred
to as H2O. 1H and 13C NMR spectra
were recorded at room temperature (rt) on a Bruker AC 400 (1H NMR, 400 MHz; 13C NMR, 100 MHz) spectrometer unless
specified otherwise. Chemical shifts are reported in δ (ppm),
and the following abbreviations are used: s, singlet; d, doublet;
dd, double doublet; t, triplet; q, quadruplet; m, multiplet, br s,
broad singlet. Coupling constants are reported in hertz and are designated
as J. Analytical purity of the final compounds was
determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a Phenomenex
Gemini 3u C18 110A column (50 mm × 4.6 mm, 3 μm), measuring
UV absorbance at 254 nm. The sample preparation and HPLC method is,
unless stated otherwise, as follows: 0.3–0.8 mg of compound
was dissolved in 1 mL of a 1:1:1 mixture of CH3CN/H2O/tBuOH and eluted from the column within 15 min, with a three-component
system of H2O/CH3CN/1% TFA in H2O,
decreasing polarity of the solvent mixture in time from 80/10/10 to
0/90/10. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis was
performed on a Finnigan Surveyor HPLC system with a Gemini C18 50
mm × 4.60 mm column (detection at 200–600 nm), coupled
to a Finnigan Licence Controller Qualification Advantage Max mass
spectrometer with electrospray ionization. The applied buffers were
H2O, CH3CN, and 1.0% aq TFA. All compounds show
a single peak at the designated retention time and are at least 95%
pure. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was routinely consulted to monitor
the progress of reactions, using aluminum-coated Merck silica gel
F254 plates. Purification by column chromatography was achieved by
use of Grace Davison Davisil silica column material (LC60A 30–200
μm). Solutions were concentrated using a Heidolph laborota W8
2000 efficient rotary evaporation apparatus and by a high vacuum on
a Binder APT line Vacuum Drying Oven.

Radioligand Binding Assays
[3H]ZM241385 (45.9 Ci/mmol)
was purchased from ARC Scopus Research (Wageningen, The Netherlands).
NECA was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). To determine
the affinities of the proposed ligands for the A2AR, radioligand
binding assays were performed. Affinities were determined on membranes
from HEK 293 cells stably expressing this human receptor, using [3H]ZM241385
as the radioligand. Membranes (25 μL) containing 10 μg
of protein were incubated in a total volume of 100 μL, containing
25 μL of tris–HCl (pH 7.4) buffer, 25 μL of radioligand
(1.7 nM [3H]ZM241385 plus buffer), and 25 μL of the tested ligands.
Incubation was done for 2 h at 25 °C in a shaking water bath.
Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 mM NECA.
The samples were harvested after filtration over prewetted Whatman
GF/B filters under reduced pressure with a Brandel harvester. Filters
were washed three times with ice-cold buffer and placed in scintillation
vials. Emulsifier Safe (3.5 mL) was added, and after 2 h, radioactivity
was counted in a TriCarb 2900TR liquid scintillation counter. Full
displacement curves of the tested ligands are given in the Figures S5–S7.
