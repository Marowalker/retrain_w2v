There is an ever-growing
need for detection methods that are both
sensitive and efficient, such that reagent and sample consumption
is minimized. Nanopillar arrays offer an attractive option to fill
this need by virtue of their small scale in conjunction with their
field enhancement intensity gains. This work investigates the use
of nanopillar substrates for the detection of the uranyl ion and DNA,
two analytes unalike but for their low quantum efficiencies combined
with the need for high-throughput analyses. Herein, the adaptability
of these platforms was explored, as methods for the successful surface
immobilization of both analytes were developed and compared, resulting
in a limit of detection for the uranyl ion of less than 1 ppm with
a 0.2 μL sample volume. Moreover, differentiation between single-stranded
and double-stranded DNA was possible, including qualitative identification
between double-stranded DNA and DNA of the same sequence, but with
a 10-base-pair mismatch.

Introduction
Nanostructures have
been the subject of a great deal of recent
work owing to the complex and unique nature of their optical properties.1−4 Recently, work has been done investigating the ability of nanopillars
to act as field enhancers for fluorescence analysis.5−7 While nanopillars may be too large for quantum confinement effects,
silicon pillars at or near 100 nm in diameter have been shown to exhibit
optical resonances within the visible spectrum, making them valuable
for fluorescence research.1,2,5,7 Not only does the nanoscale platform
of pillar arrays minimizes the reagent consumption and sample volumes,
but the vertical geometry of the pillars and the capability of coating
them with an interfacial, porous surface also increases the number
of sites available to bind fluorophores within the same field of view.
Additionally, it is possible to functionalize the surface with a wide
variety of functionalities via siloxane and other chemistries to facilitate
the binding of analytes. In this work, we utilize the versatility
and fluorescent-enhancing capabilities of nanopillars in conjunction
with different interfacial chemistries to immobilize and quantify
two analytes different except that they both have low quantum yields
and are frequently present in only trace amounts: uranium and DNA.

Events such as the nuclear disaster at the Fukushima Nuclear Power
Plant in 2011 have and will continue to pose significant hurdles to
traditional uranium detection and analysis, mostly because of the
sheer number and variety of samples that need to be evaluated. Current
approaches typically consist of extraction chromatography followed
by radiometric counting or ionization and mass analysis.8−13 While these methods are ideal for trace level samples, method complexity
as well as instrumentation investment, field portability, and footprint
can be limiting and have driven the investigation into alternate methodologies.
Herein, we examine using the coordinating compound N,N-diisobutyl-2-(octyl(phenyl)-phosphoryl)acetamide
(CMPO), used in many actinide recovery resins, to capture uranyl (UO22+) at the porous layer surface of silicon nanopillars
for fluorescence detection. The waveguide enhancement of the nanopillars
will work to combat the notoriously low quantum yield associated with
the uranyl ion, and the nature of the arrays implies that very small
sample sizes may be used and analyzed quickly, creating an ideal screening
method.

Similar advantages must be taken into consideration
when entering
the realm of bioanalytics. Like the uranyl ion, nucleic acids exhibit
low quantum yields, and only very small sample sizes are frequently
available.14 DNA quantitation has been
accomplished in the literature by a variety of methods including UV
absorbance spectroscopy and spectrofluorimetry.15−18 There has also been recent progress
using microfluidic chips in nucleic acid research as all-in-one platforms
for processes such as ligation and digestion.19−21 Denaturation
and reassociation are important physiochemical processes of DNA, the
study of which can provide valuable insight into not only the growth
of cells and viruses but also the taxonomic and evolutionary relationships
between organisms.22 Reassociation of DNA
was first measured by binding small fragments of labeled DNA to long
strands immobilized in an agar-based supporting medium, a method later
replaced with the use of a hypoxypatite column, on which double-stranded
DNA is retained but single-stranded DNA is not.22,23 However, both of these methods are time- and labor-intensive, and
while work has been done in an effort to reduce these time constraints,
such as using size-selective capillary electrophoresis to separate
double-stranded DNA samples,23 to our knowledge
a high-throughput method such as presented here has not been developed
for the purpose of reassociation evaluation. Herein, we investigate
the use of nanoscale pillar arrays for the detection of double- and
single-stranded DNA via sequestration of the strands on the pillar
surface and fluorescence measurement of added intercalating dyes.

Results
and Discussion
Determination of the Optimal Pillar Width
and Comparison To
Flat Silicon
Figure 1 shows arrays with pillar diameters ranging from 60 to 100
nm and with either 5, 10, or 25 nm of porous silicon oxide (PSO),
after being soaked in fluoresceinisothiocyanate (FITC), rinsed, and
imaged. Plot profiles of the presented images may be found in the Supporting Information. It was determined that
80–90 nm diameter pillars with 5 nm of PSO showed the greatest
fluorescence with the least amount of background, and so fabrication
parameters that would create approximately this size were used for
the fabrication of the dewetted (DW) pillars for uranyl and DNA analysis.
By using this electron beam lithography (EBL) wafer layout, we were
also able to demonstrate the large on-to-off-pillar ratio of the fluorescence
signal. This ratio decreases as the pillar width deviates from the
optimum and as the PSO thickness increases. With pillar thicknesses
greater than 100 nm and PSO thicknesses of 25 nm or greater, the effect
is nullified and the fluorescence signal on flat silicon (with a functionalized
PSO coating) can even become greater than that on pillars. The thickness
of the PSO determined the measured on/off pillar ratio. For instance,
we measured an off-pillar signal of zero for 5 nm PSO on 60–100
nm pillar diameters, which results in an on/off pillar ratio of infinity,
but for 10 nm PSO on 80 nm pillars, we were able to calculate an on/off
pillar ratio of 3.92.

Figure 1 Fluorescence microscope images of EBL pillars functionalized
with
3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) and soaked with FITC to determine
the optimum pillar width and PSO thickness are shown, with the pillar
diameter increasing down the wafer, every other array, in increments
of 10 nm, from 60 to 100 nm. Only the leftmost series of arrays on
each wafer was considered. The overall wafer and array configurations
may be seen in the Supporting Information.

Detection of Uranyl
Figure 2 shows the
range of uranyl concentrations
when spotted on CMPO arrays with their respective intensity profiles,
and the corresponding calibration curve, which plots the background-corrected
average integrated density of each spot versus its concentration.
Regression analysis indicated that the experimental data closely fit
the linear statistical model between 0 and 200 ppm, with a coefficient
of determination (R2) of 0.9842. Over
200 ppm, oversaturation of the signal resulted in not only a leveling
out of the calibration curve but also an increase in error of 400%.
The noise of the blank was used to determine figures of merit. The
limit of detection (LOD) was calculated as 0.97 ppm with a 0.2 μL
sample size, resulting in a detection platform capable of subnanogram
uranium detection. This LOD is approximately 3 orders of magnitude
less sensitive than previously reported using Uraplex, but correspondingly,
the sample volume here is minimized over 3 orders of magnitude, creating
a platform to screen for low ppm levels of the uranyl ion.31 Furthermore, the more sensitive techniques using
Uraplex were developed using time-resolved pulsed laser phosphorescence
detection, not simple fluorescence microscopy, and it stands to reason
that exploration into that high excitation intensity method of detection
combined with these nanopillar array systems could achieve substantially
lower detection limits.

Figure 2 Fluorescence microscopy images of uranyl spotted
on CMPO arrays
are shown in (A) with the corresponding heat maps below, where the
redder color indicates higher fluorescence signal intensity. Concentration
increases from left to right: blank, 1, 25, 50, 75, 100, and 200 ppm.
(B) Calibration curve for these samples. The blue circles represent
the images shown here, where the curve exhibits linearity. The orange
triangles represent the signals measured for 300, 400, and 500 ppm,
where oversaturation of signal caused the intensity to level out.
Error bars represent the standard deviation of the triplicate measurements
taken for each concentration.

Detection of DNA
It was quickly determined that spotting
was unfeasible as an application method. The arrays did not exhibit
enough of a hydrophobic nature to take advantage of the sample concentrating
within a small area. When the droplet made contact with the array
surface, it immediately wicked through the pillars and spread to an
area of ≥2 mm in diameter, greater than the field of view on
the fluorescence microscope, and dried with a significant coffee-ring
effect. Additionally, while fluorescence was visible immediately after
spotting, it was not resistant to rinsing, resulting in a negligible
signal postrinse.

Application by soaking, however, resulted
in even coverage across the array and quantifiable fluorescence even
after rinsing. Indeed, rinsing appeared to be necessary, as prerinse,
the different solutions all exhibited the same fluorescence, indicating
that there were large amounts of excess dye. The differences between
pre- and postrinse, as well as the differences between the different
solutions, are illustrated in Figure 3. The average integrated densities of the arrays pre-
and postrinse are also shown in the figure. The error in Figure 3b was calculated
as the standard deviation of the fluorescence intensity of five 400
px square areas within one array, to account for irregularities in
functionalization, and therefore analyte retention on the surface.
For ethidium bromide (EtBr), the matched solution of the ssDNA and
its exact complement exhibited approximately 175% the fluorescence
of the alone solution postrinse, whereas the mismatched solution of
the ssDNA and its 10-base-pair-mismatched complement exhibited 105%
the fluorescence of the alone solution postrinse (and 60% the magnitude
of the matched signal postrinse).

Figure 3 Fluorescent images of sample areas on
pillar arrays functionalized
for DNA immobilization and soaked with one of the four DNA solutions
are shown in (A). Sample areas are shown pre- (top) and postrinse
(bottom). (B) shows the graph of fluorescence intensity measured for
each of these eight samples.

It is possible that the fluorescence of the alone solution
is artificially
high because of self-hybridization of the single strand or possible
electrostatic interaction of EtBr with ssDNA,32 as the signal of the alone solution was roughly 4 times that of
the blank. If no hybridization was present, we would expect the two
signals to be more similar. We also hypothesize that the fluorescence
of the mismatched solution is affected by the way that EtBr is able
to intercalate with the mismatched strands. The mismatches between
the strands were designed such that no portions of the strands were
mismatched by more than three base pairs, so we do not expect that
the signal is artificially high because of self-hybridization. However,
it could be that the mismatches are insufficient to prevent EtBr from
binding, resulting in a signal which is greater than anticipated.

Experimental Section
Fabrication of EBL Arrays and Deposition
of PSO
EBL
pillar arrays were created using a previously reported process.5,24,25 This process involved writing
of the circular patterns in a positive tone electron beam resist (300
nm of ZEP 520A), followed by vacuum deposition of a 20 nm chromium
layer (VE-240, Thermonics Laboratory, Inc.) and metal lift-off in
acetone to form a mask, and finally anisotropic reactive ion etching
(RIE) of the silicon substrate not masked by chromium. The pattern
of arrays on the wafer is shown in the Supporting Information. The arrays used for this study were 10 ×
10 pillar arrays with diameters ranging from 60 to 160 nm varying
along a horizontal axis and etched to create pillars with a height
of 1 ± 0.2 μm. Each array was separated from those adjacent
by distances greater than 20 μm to avoid any possibility of
optical coupling or crosstalk.

The structure of the pillars
was confirmed with scanning electron microscope (SEM) images obtained
from a MERLIN (Carl Zeiss) microscope with a field-emission gun operating
at approximately 3 kV. Wafers were then annealed in 10% H2 in Ar under atmospheric pressure at 800 °C for 15 min in a
cold wall furnace (FirstNano) to remove any residual organics from
the pillar arrays.

The PSO coating was accomplished via room
temperature plasma enhanced
chemical vapor deposition (PECVD, Oxford Instruments) with the chamber
temperature at 27 °C and pressure at 600 mTorr.24,26,27 Deposited thicknesses included
5, 10, or 25 nm of PSO.

Determination of Ideal Pillar Widths
While using the
precise control of pillar geometries afforded by the EBL fabrication
would create a system whereby the enhancement of the analyte could
be evaluated and optimized, the EBL approach requires expensive equipment
and is a slow serial process, creating practical limits as to the
size and quantity of fabricated arrays. Therefore, pillar arrays created
via the EBL fabrication method are unfeasible as platforms because
of the time and monetary demands of a high throughput analytical method.
To meet these high demands, we decided to use a platform that may
compromise some of the optimized enhancement for quickly fabricated
vast pillar array substrates, namely, stochastic platinum DW pillar
arrays, whose usefulness has been previously expounded upon.6,24,25 To create these arrays, we first
needed to determine the optimum pillar diameter range.

To this
end, EBL arrays with a range of pillar diameters were first functionalized
with APTES by placing the pieces in a 10 v/v % APTES/toluene solution
and soaking at room temperature for 1 h. The pieces were then sequentially
rinsed with toluene, methanol, and deionized water and then were soaked
in 1 mM FITC (in ethanol) for 45 min. After a triplicate rinse in
ethanol to remove any excess FITC, fluorescence imaging of the pieces
was performed with a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope and QCapture software.
The blue-light excitation (450–490 nm excitation) was used
with the same collection time (20 s), gain (2), and offset (−500).

Fabrication of DW Pillars and Deposition of PSO
To
create high-throughput U platforms, we created silicon nanopillar
arrays using the thermal DW of a Pt-film process previously developed.6,24,28 This method begins with physical
vapor deposition of a thin, 8 nm Pt film (Thermonics Laboratory, VE-240)
on a p-type silicon wafer with 100 nm of thermally grown SiO2. During the Pt deposition, the deposition rate and the average (mass-based)
thickness of the deposited metal were monitored with a quartz-crystal
microbalance. The platinum film was then thermally annealed in a 10:1
mixture of argon and hydrogen at 735 Torr in a cold wall furnace (EasyTube
3000, First Nano, Ronkonkoma, NY) equipped with a radiative heat source.
During the annealing step, the heat source was set to its maximum
power (22 kW) for 8 s, yielding an estimated maximum substrate temperature
of 900 °C.

The thermally induced metal-film dewetting created
circular masking patterns, which, while nonuniform, exhibited the
average diameters and spacing desired. These platinum islands were
subsequently used as a selective mask for RIE (Oxford Plasmalab, Oxford
Instruments, UK). In each process, the RIE was tuned via power, pressure,
temperature, time, and plasma composition (argon, sulfur hexafluoride,
and octafluorocyclobutane) to achieve the desired etching profile
of close to vertical and depth of approximately 1 μm. Finally,
pillars were coated with 5 nm PSO by PECVD and then imaged via SEM.

Functionalization of the Surface for Uranyl Detection
The
final surface functionalization for the extraction of the uranyl
ion onto the nanopillar surface was determined by testing several
different functionalization methods for maximum signal and for the
ability of the surface to retain the uranyl after rinsing with water,
a mixture of water and ethanol, and ethanol. The details of this testing
may be found in the Supporting Information. It was decided that the best functionalization for this purpose
was a modified procedure previously mentioned in a patent as the one
that could be used to create a radioactive-substance adsorbent on
silicon dioxide particles.29 This method
coats the silicon surface with CMPO, a common actinide binding agent,
by combining it with APTES. First, the arrays were acid-etched in
50:50 sulfuric/nitric acid for 30 min and dried overnight at 80 °C.
Then, 0.05 g of CMPO was dissolved in 25 mL of ethanol, at which point
pillar arrays were added and the solution was stirred for 90 min.
Care was taken to ensure that the stirring did not cause any direct
impact with the pillar array surface. Subsequently, 5 mL of 1 mM APTES
was added to the solution and stirred for an additional 120 min under
ambient nitrogen. Then the substrate was removed from the solution
and dried under nitrogen.

A layer of tetraethyl orthosilicate
(TEOS) was then added. The patent29 indicated
that the addition of TEOS was to be done in solution, but some heavy
polymerization of the siloxane compounds was observed via SEM analysis.
This polymerization both caused damage to the pillar arrays and created
a nonuniform pillar array surface. To combat this polymerization,
the TEOS layer was deposited via a vapor phase by placing the array
under vacuum overnight with a reservoir of TEOS. The substrate was
then rinsed in triplicate by each toluene, tetrahydrofuran (THF),
ethanol, and deionized water. To create a hydrophobic surface for
spotting purposes,30 the array was placed
under vacuum overnight with a reservoir of 1:10 N-butyldimethylchlorosilane (C4)/toluene, after which the array was
rinsed for a final time in duplicate with toluene, THF, 90:10 (v/v)
water/THF, and deionized water.

Detection of Uranyl
A 1000 μg/mL (1000 ppm) stock
solution of uranyl nitrate hexahydrate (SPI Supplies) in 5% HNO3 (High Purity Standards, Lot 604605) was created and diluted
to form sample solutions containing 1, 25, 50, 75, 100, 200, 300,
400, and 500 μg/mL uranyl in 5% HNO3. They were then
spotted onto the DW arrays functionalized according to the modified
patent procedure, hereafter referred to as “CMPO arrays”,
in volumes of 0.2 μL and in triplicate.

The fluorescence
images were taken with a Nikon Eclipse LV150 microscope using the
10× objective. The microscope was equipped with a halogen-lamp
light source, a multicolor fluorescence cube (DAPI–FITC–TRITC),
and a color charge-coupled device camera (DS-2M, Nikon, Inc.) controlled
by NIS-Elements software. Fluorescence color (RGB) images with 16-bit
color depth per channel were acquired by integrating a sequence of
16 8-bit color images. The blue-light excitation was used with the
same collection time (20 s), gain (2), and offset (−500) for
both background and sample measurements.

Images were analyzed
using ImageJ software. The signal was integrated
over a circular area with a diameter equal to the largest spot. This
was done by centering the area on each spot and integrating the intensity
via ImageJ software. All data were background corrected by subtracting
the intensity produced by the surface without uranyl surrounding the
spots. The standard deviations and averages of the intensities for
each concentration were then calculated and plotted against concentration
to obtain a linear relationship.

Upon first evaluation, there
was a lack of luminescence and we
surmised that the native fluorescence of the (UO2)2+ was either too weak or being quenched by the system. However,
recent work has been done in aqueous samples with Uraplex, a uranium
complexant which extends the lifetime and minimizes quenching of (UO2)2+.31 As such, it was
decided to use this complexant with our samples. Uraplex concentrate
(Chemchek Instruments) was diluted 1:20 in deionized water and then
incorporated as 50% of the sample mixtures by volume.

Functionalization
of the Surface for DNA Detection
Our procedure for functionalization
of the pillar surface for the
immobilization of DNA is based upon work previously done by Yang et
al.19 A schematic of the process is shown
in Scheme 1. First,
the arrays were acid-bathed and dried as above. Then, the arrays were
functionalized with APTES and rinsed as above. The arrays were then
soaked in a 10 μg/mL solution of sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 1×, pH 7.4) for 1 h at room
temperature. After rinsing in triplicate with additional 1× PBS,
the arrays were dried under nitrogen and then soaked in 1 μg/mL
streptavidin in PBS (1×, pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature.
Finally, the arrays were rinsed in triplicate with 1× PBS and
then dried under nitrogen. To discourage denaturing, the arrays were
stored at 4 °C until used.

Scheme 1 Functionalization of the Pillar Surface
for DNA Immobilization
Detection of DNA
Three single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)
100-base-pair oligomers were designed and obtained from Invitrogen.
The first was biotin-terminated so that it could be bound to the pillar
array surface via the strong biotin–avidin affinity (Kaffinity ≈ 1015). The other
two oligomers were the exact complement of the first and the complement
with a 10-base pair mismatch scattered throughout the strand, respectively.
The oligomers were reconstituted in 1 mL of Tris–EDTA buffer
(TE, 1×, pH 8). Four different solutions were then created to
produce samples with a 5:1 base pair/dye molecule ratio and ∼60
nM (or ∼2 ng/μL) DNA concentrations in TE buffer (a concentration
of similar magnitude to that used in quantitative analyses).17 These solutions consisted of the biotinylated
ssDNA (“alone”), the biotinylated ssDNA with its complement
(“matched”), the biotinylated ssDNA with the complement
containing 10-base pair mismatches (“mismatched”), and
a dye blank. The intercalating dye used for fluorescence imaging was
EtBr (Sigma-Aldrich, 1.15 × 10–5 M). These
solutions were allowed to incubate for 1 h at room temperature before
being used or being stored at 4 °C for later use.

DNA solutions
were then applied to avidin-functionalized arrays in one of two ways,
either by spotting or soaking. For application by spotting, 0.1 μL
of sample was applied to the array surface and allowed to dry. The
spots were then imaged, rinsed with ∼1 mL 1× PBS buffer,
and imaged again. For application by soaking, ∼100 μL
of sample was applied to the surface of the array, with surface tension
keeping it in a droplet form over the entire array surface, and allowed
to soak for 1 h at room temperature. Also, the area of the array was
then imaged, rinsed with ∼1 mL 1× PBS buffer, and imaged
again. The same Nikon microscope as was used for the uranyl detection
was used here but with the green-light excitation (510–560
nm) for EtBr detection. The same collection time (5 s), gain (2),
and offset (−500) were used for both background and sample
measurements.

Images were analyzed using ImageJ software. The
signal was integrated
over a circular area with a diameter equal to the largest sample spot.
This is done by centering the area on each spot and integrating the
intensity via ImageJ software. In spotted arrays, the signal was background-corrected
by subtracting the integrated signal within the same-sized circular
area where there was no sample applied.

Conclusions
In
this work, we have introduced two surface chemistry approaches
for the detection of the uranyl ion and DNA, which are ideal to use
as high-throughput screening methods. Both methods consisted of creating
a multilayer extraction resin on silicon nanopillar systems. In the
case of uranyl, this allowed for the fast analysis of many samples
at subppm concentrations using subμL volumes, which, while not
as sensitive as other methods using Uraplex, could still be used for
screening purposes. In the case of DNA, this allowed for the qualitative
differentiation between picomole amounts of single-stranded and double-stranded
DNA, including identification of base-pair mismatches. The retention
of sensitivity while using minimal sample and reagent volumes and
the lack of complex and highly specific instrumentation combine to
create a platform, which is both accessible and economically advantageous.
Future avenues of research include investigating the pH dependency
of the uranyl fluorescence for additional optimization.
