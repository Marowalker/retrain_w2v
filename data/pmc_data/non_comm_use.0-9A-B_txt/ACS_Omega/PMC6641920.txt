Environmentally friendly
three chitosan Schiff bases (CSBs) were
first time synthesized under microwave irradiation by the reaction
of chitosan and aldehydes [benzaldehyde (CSB-1), 4-(dimethylamino)benzaldehyde
(CSB-2), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde (CSB-3)] and characterized
by IR and NMR spectroscopy. The corrosion inhibition performance of
the synthesized inhibitors was studied by the electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization (PDP). The results
show that all the Schiff bases (CSBs) act as effective corrosion inhibitors
for mild steel in 1 M HCl solution. Among the synthesized Schiff bases,
CSB-3 exhibited the maximum inhibition efficiency of 90.65% at a very
low concentration of 50 ppm. The EIS results showed that the CSBs
inhibit corrosion by the adsorption mechanism. The PDP results show
that all the three Schiff bases are mixed-type inhibitors. The formation
of inhibitor films on the mild steel surface was supported by scanning
electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray analysis and Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy methods. The adsorption of CSBs on the mild
steel surface obeys the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The theoretical
studies via density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulation
corroborated the experimental results.

1 Introduction
Chitosan
(N-deacetylated product of chitin) is a natural biopolymer
composed of β-d-glucosamine and N-acetyl-β-d-glucosamine units with a 1,4-linkage. Chitosan is an attractive
material because of its properties such as immunological activity,
biocompatibility, low toxicity, and biodegradability.1,2 Therefore, chitosan finds wide applications in medicine, cosmetics,
textile, and many other industrial branches.3−5 The anticorrosive
nature of chitosan is attributed to the presence of −NH2 and −OH groups through which it can coordinate with
metal surfaces.6 In addition to its biodegradability,
chitosan has been reported as an environmentally benign corrosion
inhibitor.7,8

Hydrochloric acid finds wide application
in various industrial
processes such as pickling, cleaning, descaling, and acidizing process
of oil wells because of its low cost and effective cleaning action
as compared to other mineral acids. The use of corrosion inhibitors
is one of the best practical methods to reduce the corrosivity of
the acid solutions. Organic compounds containing nitrogen, oxygen,
phosphorus, and sulfur have been reported as corrosion inhibitors.
They are adsorbed on the metal surface and block the active sites
thereby retarding the corrosion reaction occurring on the metal surface.9,10 Most of the organic compounds are toxic in nature. Therefore, the
search for finding an eco-friendly corrosion inhibitor has received
enormous attention. In this regard, chitosan and its derivatives have
received much attention as corrosion inhibitors. In view of its eco-friendly
nature, several authors have studied chitosan and its derivatives
as corrosion inhibitors for various metals and alloys.11−13

One of the major drawbacks of chitosan and its earlier reported
derivatives is poor solubility, which restricts its performance and
renders it less effective. As far as ecological factors are considered,
it would be beneficial to use environmentally friendly compounds for
modification of the polymer matrix. The selection of chitosan Schiff
bases (CSBs) as corrosion inhibitors is based on the fact that they
are nontoxic and can be easily synthesized and insertion of imine
linkage (−HC=N) in chitosan is likely to improve the
anticorrosion performance and the film-forming capability. Recently,
we synthesized chitosan-thiosemicarbazide and chitosan-thiocarbohydrazide
and tested them as corrosion inhibitors in 1 M HCl, and good results
were obtained. This prompted us to synthesize a few more chemically
modified chitosan derivatives.7,14 One of the important
features of the work is that in the present work, we, herein for the
first time, report the microwave-induced synthesis of Schiff bases
of chitosan with benzaldehyde, N,N-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, and o-hydroxyanisaldehyde.
The use of microwave synthesis offers following benefits. It increases
the rate of chemical reaction, yield of the product. The product is
obtained in high purity without involving cumbersome purification
steps.15 The synthesized derivatives were
characterized with Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and NMR studies.
Their corrosion inhibition behavior on mild steel in hydrochloric
acid has been investigated using gravimetric studies, electrochemical
measurements and surface, analysis. Density functional theory (DFT)-
and molecular dynamics (MD)-based theoretical studies have also been
used to corroborate experimental results.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of the
Synthesized CSB Inhibitors
The FTIR spectra of the synthesized
Schiff bases are displayed
in Figure 1. The peaks
at 1647, 1598, and 1646 cm–1 correspond to the stretching
vibration of −the C=N– bond of CSB-1, CSB-2,
and CSB-3, respectively.15 There is no
characteristic peak of carbonyl group of free aldehydes in the region
1670–1820 cm–1. These findings suggest the
formation of Schiff bases, which was further confirmed by the NMR
spectroscopy analysis, as shown in Figure S1. The details of FTIR and 1H NMR spectra are given below:16

2.2 Gravimetric Measurement
2.2.1 Effect of Inhibitor Concentration
and Immersion
Time
The results on the effect of varying concentrations
of inhibitor on the corrosion of mild steel in 1 M HCl are listed
in Table 1. It can
be observed that upon the addition of CSBs in the corrosive media,
the corrosion rate (CR) decreases significantly,
while inhibition efficiency increases with increase in the inhibitor
concentration, as a result of increase in the number of adsorbed inhibitor
molecules over the active sites of the mild steel surface. However,
above the 50 ppm of inhibitor concentration, IE was nearly constant,
which suggests that 50 ppm concentration of CSBs is optimum for the
protection of mild steel corrosion in 1 M HCl. Among the three Schiff
bases, CSB-3 shows the highest IE of 90.65% at 50 ppm. The IE of these
CSBs is in the order CSB-3 > CSB-2 > CSB-1. The difference in
the
corrosion inhibition behavior of CSBs can be explained on the basis
of difference in the chemical structure of the investigated inhibitors
as the difference in the inhibition performance of CSBs can be attributed
to the presence of different substituent groups on the benzene ring.
The CSB-3 has two substituents: −OCH3 group at 3-position
and −OH group at 4-position of the benzene ring, the CSB-2
has only one substituent: a dimethylamine group at the 4-position
of the benzene ring, while CSB-1 has no substituents. These substituents
have a lone pair of electrons on the heteroatom (oxygen, nitrogen),
which increases the electron density of the benzene ring and enhances
the inhibition efficiency of inhibitor molecules. These Schiff base
derivatives of chitosan show a higher inhibition efficiency at a lower
concentration than previously reported for chitosan and its derivatives.7,17−20

To determine the stability of the inhibitor film on the mild steel/solution
interface with a longer immersion period, gravimetric measurement
was performed at 303 ± 2 K for 12–30 h in 1 M HCl at 50
ppm of CSBs. The results, as depicted in Figure 2a, show that with increase in the immersion
time the IE remains almost constant up to 30 h.21

(b) temperature.

2.2.2 Effect
of Temperature
The variation
of IE of CSBs at the optimum concentration recorded in the temperature
range of 303–333 K is shown in Figure 2b. From the figure, it can be seen that the
IE of all the three inhibitors slightly decreases with increase in
the temperature. It may be attributed to partial desorption of adsorbed
inhibitor molecules from the mild steel surface. The effect of temperature
on corrosion parameters in the absence and presence of CSBs can be
determined by comparison of activation energy (Ea), which is derived with the help of Arrhenius relationship: 1  where A is a constant and T and R are absolute temperature and universal
gas constant, respectively. The activation energy (Ea) was calculated from the slope value of the obtained
Arrhenius plot in the absence and presence of inhibitors (Figure 3). The calculated
values of Ea for blank was 32.96 kJ/mol,
while in the presence of CSB-1, CSB-2, and CSB-3, the Ea were 55.18, 58.33, and 62.83 kJ/mol, respectively. The
higher activation energy in the presence of CSBs suggests that the
CSBs formed a barrier for the dissolution of mild steel in acid solution.

plots for the corrosion rate of mild steel vs the temperature
in 1 M HCl.

2.2.3 Adsorption
Isotherm
To analyze
the adsorption behavior of investigated inhibitors on the mild steel
surface, several adsorption isotherms were tested including the Langmuir,
Temkin, and Frumkin isotherms.22 Langmuir
adsorption isotherm was found to provide the best agreement with the
adsorption of used inhibitors on the mild steel surface with a value
of regression coefficient (R2) closer
to one, as shown in Figure 4, than the Temkin and Frumkin isotherms represented in Figure S2a,b. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm
can be represented by the following equation: 2  where C is the concentration
of inhibitor and θ is the fraction of surface coverage which
is calculated from the inhibition efficiency. It can be clearly observed
from Figure 4 that
the plot of C/θ versus C gave
the straight line having the slope as unity and the values of R2 in the order 0.9998–0.9999. The adsorption
equilibrium constants (Kads) obtained
from the intercept of plot were 1057, 1147, and 1207 L g–1 for CSB-1, CSB-2, and CSB-3, respectively, indicating a high adsorption
percentage of CSB molecules on the mild steel surface.23 The Kads is related
with adsorption free energy (ΔGads0) by the following
equation:24,25 3  

Figure 4 Langmuir
isotherm plot for the adsorption of CSBs on mild steel
surface in 1 M HCl.

The value of 1000 is
the concentration of water in acid solution
in g L–1. In the present study, the calculated values
of ΔGads0 were −34.95, −35.16, and −35.28
kJ/mol for CSB-1, CSB-2, and CSB-3, respectively. This finding suggested
that the CSBs were spontaneously adsorbed on the mild steed surface
and exhibited mixed mode of adsorption as discussed previously.26

2.3 Electrochemical Study
2.3.1 Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy
Nyquist and
Bode plots of mild steel immersed in 1 M HCl in the
absence and presence of CSBs in the concentration range 5–50
ppm are depicted in Figures 5 and 6, respectively. Among the studied
CSBs, the Nyquist plots of CSB-1 showed a large capacitive loop at
higher frequency (HF) and a small inductive loop at lower frequency
(LF). Similar results were observed in previous work.21,26 The occurrence of a capacitive loop at HF indicated that the corrosion
of mild steel in 1 M HCl solution is mainly controlled by the charge
transfer process,27 whereas the presence
of small inductive loops at LF may be due to the relaxation of adsorbed
species or redissolution of the passive layer.27 The Nyquist plots of CSB-2 showed only one capacitive loop,
whereas that of CSB-3 showed two capacitive loops. In case of CSB-3,
the occurrence of first time constant at HF corresponding to transfer
resistance (Rct) may be ascribed to the
charge transfer process between the metal solution interface, and
the second capacitive loop is attributable to the film resistance
(Rf), arising due to the adsorption of
CSB-3 molecules.28

steel in 1 M HCl without and with different
concentrations of CSBs 1 M HCl.

Figure 6 Bode (f vs |Z|) and phase angle
(f vs α0) plots for mild steel in
1 M HCl in the absence and presence of different concentrations of
CSBs.

To analyze the experimental results,
an appropriate equivalent
circuit model is required to correctly fit the impedance curves. In
the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Figure 5, L is the inductance and Rs, Rct, RL, and Rf represent
the solution resistance, charge transfer resistance, inductive resistance,
and film resistance, respectively. The constant phase elements, CPE
and CPEf, are used in the place of double layer capacitance
(Cdl) and film capacitance (Cf), respectively.29,30 The impedance of the
CPE can be given by 4  where Y0 and n represent the magnitude and exponent
(phase shift) of
CPE, respectively, and ωmax is the angular frequency
(given by ω = 2πf) at which the imaginary
part of impedance is maximum (rad s–1). The double
layer capacitance Cdl is defined as 5  

The same relation is for the film resistance
(Cf), hence, in the presence of CSB-3
the corresponding
capacitance (C) is as follows28 6  

In the
presence of CSB-1, the ac polarization resistance (Rp) was determined by the following relationship: 7  

In case of CSB-2, the Rp is equal to Rs + Rct, whereas
in case of CSB-3, Rp is equivalent to
the Rs + Rct + Rf.31 The
IE was calculated from the Rp by using
the following equation 8  where Rp0 and Rpi represent the
polarization resistance in the absence and presence of inhibitor,
respectively. The obtained impedance results are listed in Table 2. In the case of CSB-1,
the value of the RL was considerably lower
than that of the Rp. Hence, for calculating
the IE, only the values of Rp were considered.27 The goodness of fit (χ2) values
were of the order of 10–3, which supported the fitness
of the proposed circuit. The results showed that in the presence of
CSBs, the values of Rp are increased,
indicating the formation of an insulating film between the metal–electrolyte
interface, which resists the charge transfer and therefore inhibits
the mild steel dissolution. The IE increases with increase in the
CSB concentration and reaches a maximum value of 85.05, 88.89, and
89.47% at 50 ppm of CSB-1, CSB-2, and CSB-3, respectively. Hence,
among the three CSBs, CSB-3 showed the highest inhibition performance,
supporting the gravimetric results. The values of Cdl and C are decreased in the presence
of inhibitor. According to the Helmholtz model,27 the drop in Cdl may be due
to a decrease in the local dielectric constant and/or an increase
in the thickness of electrical double layer at the metal solution
interface. This indicates that the CSBs (having a lower dielectric
constant) adsorb on the metal surface by replacing the pre-adsorbed
water having a high dielectric constant and therefore retarding the
mild steel corrosion.

The corresponding Bode plots and phase angle
plots of CSBs are
shown in Figure 6.
From Figure 6, the
low frequency impedance modulation (f vs |Z|) of Bode plots increased with addition of CSBs which
further increases with increase in the inhibitor concentration, related
to the adsorption of CSBs molecule on the mild steel surface.32 The value of phase angle increased from 45°
to 65° with the addition of CSBs in the concentration range of
5–50 ppm (Figure 6), which indicates an improvement in the inhibition behavior of CSBs
with increase in the concentration of the inhibitor molecules.33

2.3.2 Potentiodynamic Polarization
Study
The potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) curves for mild
steel in 1
M HCl in the absence and presence of various concentrations of synthesized
CSB inhibitors at 303 K are shown in Figure 7. The values of polarization parameters such
as Ecorr, corrosion current density (icorr), cathodic Tafel slope (βc), anodic Tafel slope (βa), and IE are represented
in Table 3. It can
be observed that with increase in the concentration of CSBs, both
the anodic and cathodic current densities are reduced, indicating
the suppression of both the anodic Fe dissolution and the cathodic
evolution of H2. In the presence of CSBs, the values of Ecorr exhibit a pronounced shift toward the cathodic
direction, which suggests the cathodic predominance of the inhibitor.
This trend confirms a greater influence of the inhibitors on the hydrogen
evolution reaction. However, the values of βc and
βa do not exhibit much change, which indicates that
there is no change in the mechanism of hydrogen evolution or Fe dissolution,
respectively. The decrease in both the anodic and cathodic currents
in the presence of inhibitor without significantly changing the Ecorr value, suggests that the CSBs exhibit a
mixed-type corrosion inhibition behavior. The inhibition efficiency
was calculated from the icorr values,
through the following relationship: 9  where icorr0 and icorri are the corrosion
current densities in the absence and presence of inhibitors, respectively.
From the results (Table 3), it is clear that the values of IE increase with increase in the
concentration of CSBs and maximum IE were obtained 84.59, 87.28, and
91.98% at 50 ppm of CSB-1, CSB-2, and CSB-3, respectively.

2.4 Surface
Study
2.4.1 FTIR Spectral Analysis
The FTIR
spectra of CSBs, mild steel, and inhibited mild steel after 12 h immersion
1 M HCl solution are shown in Figure 8. The FTIR spectra of the synthesized CSBs are already
discussed in section 3 (Figure 1). The FTIR–attenuated
total reflectance (ATR) spectra of inhibited mild steel showed corresponding
peaks of inhibitors (Figure 8), and these inhibitor peaks are absent in the spectra of
the sample without inhibitor, indicating the existence of CSBs on
the mild steel surface. The broad peak appeared between 3416 and 3425
cm–1 because of the presence of the OH of Schiff
bases (Figure 1); these
peaks were shifted to 3300–3331 cm–1 in inhibited
mild steel spectra (Figure 8). This indicates the involvement of the OH group in adsorption.11 The bands corresponding to C=C (1447–1507
cm–1) and C=N (1647–1598 cm–1) of CSB inhibitors (Figure 1) were slightly shifted to 1503–1509 and 1622–1628
cm–1, respectively, in inhibited spectra of mild
steel (Figure 8), which
indicated the involvement of the π-bond of imine and benzene
ring in the adsorption CSBs on the mild steel surface.49

2.4.2 Scanning
Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive
X-ray Analysis (EDX)
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images of the cleaned and abraded mild steel surface in 1 M HCl in
the absence and in the presence of optimum concentrations of CSBs
are shown in Figure 9. The image of the blank mild steel sample (i.e., in the absence
of inhibitor) depicts considerable damage and surface inhomogeneity
because of the corrosive attack of the acid solution. However, in
the presence of CSBs, a considerable improvement in the surface smoothness
can be easily observed. This is attributable to the adsorption of
CSBs over the mild steel surface and the formation of a protective
film which isolates the mild steel surface from the surrounding corrosive
environment. The EDX spectra of blank (Figure 10) show the presence of oxygen peak is attributed
to the slow atmospheric oxidation mild steel surface and therefore
the formation of oxide films of Fe, during the analysis. However,
in the presence of inhibitors, EDX spectra show the additional peak
of nitrogen, indicating the adsorption of CSBs on the mild steel surface.

2.5 Theoretical Studies
2.5.1 Quantum
Chemical Parameters
The
optimized molecular structures and the corresponding frontier molecular
orbital electron density of neutral CSBs in aqueous phase are shown
in Figure 10. The
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) electron density provides
information about the sites of the molecule that are more likely to
donate electrons to the appropriate orbital of an acceptor molecule.
The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) electron density shows
the sites that are more likely to accept electrons from a suitable
donor species. The energy of the HOMO (EHOMO) is associated with the tendency of electron donation, whereas the
energy of the LUMO (ELUMO) is associated
with the tendency of electron acceptance. Therefore, a higher value
of EHOMO signifies an easier donation
of electrons from the inhibitor to the vacant d-orbitals of the metal.
On the other hand, a lower value of ELUMO suggests an easier tendency of the inhibitor to accept electrons
from the filled orbitals of metal via retro-donation. The calculated
quantum chemical parameters of the three CSBs are listed in Table 4 along with the experimentally
obtained corrosion inhibition efficiency values.

Following
Koopman’s theorem, the frontier orbital energies
can be given by 10   11  where I and A represent the ionization
potential and electron affinity of the
molecule, respectively. Thus, a higher value of EHOMO in CSB 2 than CSB 1 is attributed to the presence
of the dimethyl amino group. The −OH and −OCH3 groups of CSB-3 contribute toward further increase in the EHOMO values. This observation suggests that
CSB 3 exhibits the highest electron donation tendency. The ELUMO on the other hand presents an inverse trend,
that is, the CSB 1 shows the highest tendency to accept electrons.
However, the ΔE value, which is a measure of
the reactivity index, is the lowest in the case of CSB-3. This further
supports its higher tendency to adsorb on the metal surface.

The absolute electronegativity (χ) defines the electron attraction
ability of a group of atoms toward itself and it can be given as 12  

According to HSAB principle,50 the electron
transfer takes place from the region of lower electronegativity to
the region of higher electronegativity until the chemical potentials
(μ) become equal. The global hardness (η) poses a barrier
which needs to be over for the electron transfer to take place. In
other words, a higher value of η signifies the lesser tendency
of electron transfer. Its inverse, the global softness (σ),
on the other hand, presents the higher tendency of a molecule to undergo
chemical reaction. Pearson has postulated that the hard molecules
have a large HOMO–LUMO gap and soft molecules have a small
HOMO–LUMO gap.34 Therefore, the
energy gap ΔE can be directly related to the
global hardness. This relationship is based on the principle of maximum
hardness, which states that “a molecule arranges itself to
be as hard as possible.”

The global hardness and softness
can be related to the energy of
HOMO and LUMO as follows: 13   14  

From Table 4, it
is obvious that the CSB 3 has the lowest values of χ, which
suggests the highest tendency of electron donation. Also, the lowest
η and consequently the highest σ values suggest the highest
reactivity of CSB-3. Thus, these data correlate well with those of
the trend in the energy gap values shown above. Pearson has reported
that the fraction of electrons transferred between inhibitor molecules
and the metal surface can be estimated according to the following
equation: 15  where χmetal and χinh represent the absolute electronegativities of the metal
and inhibitor, respectively, and χmetal and χinh denote the global hardness values of the metal and inhibitor,
respectively. Here, it is important to mention that the value ΔN does not provide the exact number of electrons transferred
between the inhibitor and the metal surface. It is indicative of the
electron donating ability or a tendency to donate electrons. To calculate
the fraction of electrons transferred between the inhibitor and the
metal, a theoretical value of 7 eV for χFe of bulk
iron and a global hardness ηFe = 0 are used, assuming I = A for bulk metal.35

Kokalj36 has reported
that the use of
work function metal rather than χFe is more suitable
for an adsorbate–metal surface interaction. Thus, using it
in the place of χFe and putting ηFe = 0, the above equation becomes 15 16  

The DFT calculated
values for Fe(100), Fe(110), and Fe(111) surfaces
are 3.91, 4.82, and 3.88 eV, respectively. In the present investigation,
we have considered the Fe(110) surface because of its higher stabilization
energy and packed surface. The transfer of electrons from the inhibitor
molecule to the metallic surface will take place when ΔN > 0 and vice versa.21 From
the data shown in Table 4, it is clear that (i) for the three CSBs, ΔN > 0 and (ii) the CSB 3 shows the highest value of ΔN. Therefore, it is clear that the trend of calculated quantum
chemical parameters matches the trend of experimentally determined
corrosion inhibition efficiency.

2.5.2 Fukui
Index Analysis
An analysis
of Fukui indices was performed to theoretically determine the sites
present in the inhibitor molecules that are more likely to participate
in the donor–acceptor type interaction with the metal surface.
The sites on the inhibitor molecules that donate and accept electrons
are represented by fk+ (nucleophilic site) and fk– (electrophilic
site), respectively. A higher value of the fk– and fk+ parameter represents a greater tendency of electron donation and
acceptance, respectively. The calculated Fukui index values are listed
in Table 5. It can
be observed that the sites most susceptible for electron donation
in CSB-1 are O(19), O(25), and O(30), whereas the sites most susceptible
for electron acceptance are N(42), C(43), C(45), C(47), and C(49).
In CSB-2, the sites susceptible for electron donation are N(10), C(12),
C(16), and N(64), whereas the sites susceptible for electron acceptance
are N(42), C(43), C(45), C(47) and C(49). In case of CSB-3, the susceptible
sites for electron donation are O(19), O(30), and O(64), whereas the
susceptible sites for electron acceptance are N(42), C(43), C(45),
and O(92). Therefore, it can be observed that in the CSBs, the phenyl
rings and the functional groups are the most active sites for the
electron donation–acceptance type interaction, and hence, these
are the sites most likely to facilitate adsorption over the mild steel
surface.

2.5.3 MD Simulation
The effective corrosion
inhibitors exert their function by either acquiring a specific molecular
structure, which contains diverse reactive sites and/or by adapting
their conformation in more planar form covering a large area of the
corroded surface.37 Both modes of action
increase the ability of the inhibitor molecules to interact with the
surface of the metal. Therefore, a full understanding of a corrosion
inhibitor function requires an interpretable description of complex
interactions between an inhibitor and metal atoms. MD simulations
have been largely used to study the corrosion inhibition process in
solvent allowing us to examine inhibition mechanisms and inhibitor
conformation change in atomistic detail. In the current study, MD
simulation was performed for the three CSBs using Discover module
implemented in Materials Studio software. All simulation systems reach
equilibrium only if both the energy and temperature reach balance.38,39Figure 11 shows
the equilibrium configurations of the surface adsorbed inhibitor molecules.
As can be seen from Figure 11, the inhibitor molecules adsorbed on the iron surface in
a parallel manner which can help ensure coverage of a maximum surface
area of the corroded metal. Polymer-based inhibitors are thought to
have higher affinities for the metal surface than small molecule inhibitors,
because they can interact with a larger contact area compared with
small molecules. In this situation, strong interactions between inhibitor
molecules and iron atoms can be produced. The presence of several
reactive sites such as nonbonding electrons present on nitrogen atoms
of the inhibitor molecules and methoxy and hydroxy groups enhance
the tendency of said compounds to donate their electrons to the vacant
d-orbitals of iron atoms.40 In fact, perhaps
the most striking picture to emerge from the data shown in Figure 11 is the adsorption
profile of CSB-3; it is observed that the phenyl ring containing methoxy
and hydroxy groups exists in close contact with the iron surface.
Even though the changes between inhibitor molecules were small from
a molecular point of view, the presence of both groups in CSB-3 was
most significant among other groups. Thus, a change in the structure,
and/or in the nature of the functional group, is expected to affect
the compound’s efficiency, as observed in this study. Generally
speaking, the compounds having the −N(CH3)2 group have high inhibitive activity as compared to the compounds
having −OCH3 and −OH groups.40 However, in the present study, the presence of both groups
(−OCH3 and −OH) in the parent structure increases
the electron donating tendency of CSB-3 as compared to CSB-1 and CSB-2,
leading to more impact on corrosion retardation ability. Lesser inhibition
shown by the CSB-2 as compared to CSB-3 may be attributed to the orientation
of substituent −N(CH3)2 group, which
prevents its flat orientation on the metal surface causing less adsorption
and thereby less inhibition. A similar explanation has been given
earlier.41

the final adsorption of tested inhibitors
on the Fe(110) surface in solution.

Table 6 shows
the
binding (Ebinding) and interaction (Einteraction) energies of three inhibitors obtained
under equilibrium conditions. Closer inspection of the table shows
that all the tested compounds are associated with strong, stable,
and spontaneous adsorption on the Fe(110) surface.42,43 The high magnitude of the binding energies for all the inhibitor
molecules indicates that they adsorbed through more than one adsorption
centers.44,45 A detailed analysis of the results showed
that the magnitude of interaction energy increases on going from CSB-1
to CSB-3, which directly indicates that effectiveness of the adsorption
and thereby inhibition efficiency increase in the same sequence. The
results of the study also indicate that CSB-1 and CSB-2 have significantly
less interaction energy than CSB-3, although in contrast, no difference
was observed in the adsorption profile of the three compounds. These
findings provide further evidence for a strong association between
functional groups, heteroatoms, and inhibitive performances. The compound
with both hydroxy and methoxy groups in its molecular structure appears
to have a marked influence on the corrosion inhibition process as
compared to other groups.

2.5.4 Radial Distribution Function
After
showing the adsorption potentialities of the studied corrosion inhibitors,
we would like to discuss the molecule–molecule interaction
types by measuring the typical bonding length. For this purpose, radial
distribution function (RDF) was calculated for the three inhibitors
using MD simulations trajectories. Particularly, the typical bond
lengths of physisorption are greater than 3.5 Å, much longer
than chemical interaction types, which fall in the range of 1–3.5
Å.46

RDFs of all inhibitor molecules
are represented in Figure 12. It is well-known that the position of a first prominent
peak in the RDF curve can reflect the state of inhibitor molecules
adjacent to the iron surface.8 On the basis
of the radial distribution of inhibitor molecules, a first prominent
peak for (CSB-3)–Fe, (CSB-2)–Fe, and (CSB-1)–Fe
are observed, located at 2.25, 2.75, and 3.25 Å, respectively,
which are all less than 3.5 Å, signifying the most important
interactions of all inhibitor atoms with the iron surface. To gain
further understanding of potential atomic sites that may underlie
the effectiveness of the tested compounds, we analyzed the impact
of the oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon atoms on the metal–inhibitor
interaction. According to the profiles of RDFs in Figure 12, it can be seen that generally
all atoms have significant interactions with the metal surface. The
most important RDF is calculated for oxygen atoms, which have the
peak distance lower than 3.5 Å in all inhibitor molecules. The
fact that oxygen atoms have very pronounced interactions with the
metal surface could be very important because these atoms are located
in the near vicinity of the iron atoms, meaning that the inhibitor–iron
interactions could be of importance. Carbon atoms have the peak distances
located at around 3.5 Å, indicating that π-electrons contribute
effectively to the interaction between organic species and the iron
surface. On the other side, nitrogen atoms have the peak distances
higher than 3.5 Å, meaning the ability of these atomic sites
to be protonated in the studied medium, and therefore, a physical
interaction can be easily created.24 Theoretical
simulations and experimental results support the assumption that including
two electron donating groups in the parent structure will optimize
the corrosion inhibition performances of our compounds.

3 Conclusions
In the
present study, three CSBs were synthesized and investigated
as corrosion inhibitors for mild steel in 1 M HCl solution by the
experimental and theoretical methods. On the basis of results, following
conclusions have been drawn:1. The inhibition efficacy increases with
increasing the inhibitor concentration and maximum inhibition efficiency
was obtained 84.59, 87.28 and 91.89% for CSB-1, CSB-2, and CSB-3,
respectively, at 50 ppm.

2. The adsorption of CSB inhibitors on
the mild steel surface obeys the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The
values of ΔGads0 (−34.95 to −35.28 kJ/mol) indicates
that the adsorption of inhibitors on the mild steel surface is spontaneous
and takes place by mixed mode of adsorption.

3. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) results suggested that CSBs protect the mild steel corrosion
by the formation of a protective inhibitor film at the metal–electrolyte
interface.

4. The PDP results
reveal that all the
three CSBs behave as mixed-type corrosion inhibitors and exhibit cathodic
predominance.

5. The formation
of the inhibitor film
was corroborated by FTIR–ATR and SEM/EDX.

6. The theoretical studies via DFT, Fukui

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Test Solution
Chitosan
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The aldehydes were obtained from
Avra. The corrosion tests were performed on the mild steel coupons
having weight percentage composition (wt %) of C; 0.0737%, Si; 0.0826%,
Mn; 0.556%, P; 0.0304%, S; 0.0141%, and balance Fe (99.2432%). The
mild steel coupons were cut in dimension 2.5 cm × 2.0 cm ×
0.05 cm were taken for the gravimetric study and surface analysis.
For the electrochemical tests, the mild steel specimens of dimension
8.0 cm × 1.0 cm × 0.05 cm were taken, having 1 cm2 exposed area, and the rest of the surface was covered by epoxy resin.
Prior to conducting the experiment, the mild steel specimens were
mechanically polished using different grades of SiC emery papers (from
600 to 1200), then degreased with acetone, washed with double distilled
water, dried, and stored in a desiccator before use.

The test
solution of 1 M HCl was prepared from analytical grade hydrochloric
acid (HCl. 37% Fisher Scientific) with double distilled water. The
tests were carried out in aerated and unstirred solution at 303 ±
2 K.

4.2 Synthesis of Inhibitors (CSBs)
The
Schiff bases of chitosan (CS) were synthesized according to Figure 13. CS (3 g) was
added to 99 mL distilled water and was dissolved by addition of 1
g glacial acetic acid at room temperature. The 0.05 mol of different
aldehydes (benzaldehyde, 4-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde)
was dissolved in 95% ethanol. This solution was added to the flask
containing chitosan solution dropwise with constant stirring at 303
K for 30 min. The mixture was subjected to irradiation in a Microwave
Synthesis Workstation (Sineo MAS-II: Shanghai, China), which is capable
to deliver selectable power up to 1000 W at a frequency of 2450 MHz
at full power. The reactor system was equipped with an infrared temperature
measurement tube, a mechanical agitator, and a 100 mL reaction flask
coupled to a reflux condenser. The power was set at 600 W, and the
sample temperature was ramped to 60 °C and kept at 60 °C
for 15–20 min. The resulting yellow gel solution of Schiff
base was precipitated using acetone followed by several acetone washing
steps to remove any unreacted aldehyde. Subsequently, the samples
were dried under vacuum at 303 K and the purity was tested by thin-layer
chromatography (90% n-hexane–ethyl acetate).
The FTIR spectra were recorded by using an FTIR (PerkinElmer Version
10.03.05 instrument) spectrometer, and 1H NMR spectra were
recorded using a Bruker 500 MHz instrument operating at 500 MHz.

4.3 Corrosion
Tests
4.3.1 Gravimetric Study
Gravimetric tests
were performed through the immersion of precleaned mild steel specimen
in a conical flask containing 100 mL test solution (1 M HCl and 1
M HCl with different concentrations of CSBs) at 303 ± 2 K in
the thermostat, by using the ASTM procedure.47 The mild steel specimens were taken out after 6 h, washed with water
and acetone, dried, and reweighed for the calculation of weight loss.
Each experiment was repeated twice, and the average weight loss values
were used to calculate the corrosion rate CR (mg cm–2 h–1) by using the following
equation48 17  where w is the average weight
loss (mg), A is the area of specimen (cm–2), and t is the exposure time (h–1). By using the calculated values of CR, inhibition efficiency (IE %) and surface coverage (θ) can
be calculated through the following relationship49 18   19  where CR and CR(i) are
the obtained corrosion rates in the
absence and presence of CSBs, respectively.

4.3.2 Electrochemical
Tests
The electrochemical
experiments were performed using a Gamry Potentiostat/Galvanostat
(model G-300), and the obtained data were fitted and analyzed by a
Gamry Echem Analyst 5.0 software. A three electrode glass cell assembly
was used for conducting the electrochemical experiments, which consisted
of a mild steel coupon having 1 cm2 exposed area (one sided)
as the working electrode, graphite rod as the counter electrode, and
saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode.

Prior to each experiment, the working electrode was immersed in the
test solution for 30 min to achieve a steady state open circuit potential
(EOCP). The EIS was conducted on mild
steel at EOCP in the frequency range 100
kHz to 0.01 Hz by applying the ac signal 10 mV peak to peak. Finally,
the PDP experiment was carried out by changing the potential in the
range from −250 to +250 mV versus EOCP with a constant sweep rate of 0.1 mV/s.

4.3.3 Surface
Study (FTIR and SEM/EDX)
FTIR was used to confirm the adsorption
of CSBs on the metal surface
using the ATR technique. The surface morphology and elemental composition
of uninhibited and inhibited mild steel specimens was studied using
the SEM/EDX, Zeiss EVO 50 XVP instrument. The SEM images of mild steel
were recorded at 500× magnification.

4.4 Theoretical Study
4.4.1 Quantum Chemical Calculations
The
quantum-based calculations were conducted using Materials Studio software
package (version 6.0)50 at DFT/GGA level
using BOP functional and DNP basis set on all atoms.48,51,52 The calculations were carried
out after optimizing the structures. The COSMO53 controls were used for solvation effects (aqueous phase).

4.4.2 Fukui Functions
The calculation
of the Fukui functions was carried out using UCA-FUKUI v 1.0 software54 using the output file from Gaussian 09. The
Fukui function (fk) is the first derivative
of the electron density ρ(r̅) with respect
to the number of electrons N in a constant external
potential ν(r̅) and can be expressed
as follows 20  

The nucleophilic
and electrophilic
attacks were computed using the finite-difference approximations method55 21   22  Here, qk represents
the gross charge on the atom. The charges on the anionic, neutral,
and cationic species are denoted by qk(N + 1), qk(N), and qk(N – 1), respectively.

4.4.3 MD
Simulation and RDF
MD simulation
is currently the most popular method for investigating the intermolecular
interactions between corrosion inhibitor molecules and the metal surface
under periodic boundary situations.56,57 In the present
study, the Fe(110) surface with a slab of 5 Å was chosen for
MD simulation as this iron surface is associated with high stabilization
energy with highly packed structure. To provide a larger surface area
for metal–inhibitor interactions, the simulations were carried
out in a simulation box (24.82 × 24.82 × 35.69 Å3), which included 9Cl–, 491H2O, 9H3O+, and one inhibitor molecule. The simulations
were constructed with the help of the Visualizer, Amorphous Cell,
and Discover modules implemented in BIOVIA Materials Studio commercial
software.50 MD simulations are performed
at temperatures T = 303 K maintained constant by
the Andersen thermostat, at a time step of 0.1 fs, NVT (fixed atom
number, system volume, and temperature) ensemble and a simulation
time of 2000 ps to reach simulation system under an equilibrium state.
The energy minimization and MD calculation processes were performed
using COMPASS (the condensed-phase optimized molecular potential for
atomistic simulation studies) force field.58 The extent of the interactions of the inhibitor molecules adsorbed
on the Fe(110) surface can be demonstrated by their interaction (Einteraction) and binding (Ebinding) energies derived using eqs 23 and 24.37 23   24  where Etotal represents
the energy of the entire system, Esurface+solution denotes the entire energy of Fe(110) and electrolytic solution in
the absence of inhibitor molecules, and Einhibitor denotes the whole energy of inhibitor molecules.

For more
detailed information about the interactions between the inhibitor
molecules and metal surface, RDFs (defined here as the probability
of finding particle B within the range around particle A) were calculated
from the simulation trajectories:59 the
RDF is defined by Hansen and McDonald as60 25  where
local represents the particle density
of B averaged over all shells around particle A.
