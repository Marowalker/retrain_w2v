The electronic structure and thermoelectric
properties of FeAsS
are studied by the first-principles and the Boltzmann transport theory.
The results show that FeAsS is a semiconductor with an indirect band
gap of 0.73 eV. The dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) has obvious anisotropy, ZT value along the x- and y-directions is significantly larger
than that along the z-direction, and p-type doping
has better thermoelectric performance than n-type doping. The largest ZT value can reach 0.84, which is for p-type doping along
the x-direction. The lattice thermal conductivity
is extremely low, which is smaller than 1 W m–1 K–1. The results show that FeAsS is a promising candidate
for thermoelectric applications.

1 Introduction
The environmental pollution
and energy crisis are becoming more
and more serious; therefore, it is of great significance to study
novel thermoelectric materials.1,2 The dimensionless figure
of merit ZT = S2σT/k is an important metrics for the conversion
efficiency of thermoelectric materials;3 here, the S, σ, and T represent
Seebeck coefficient which is sometimes referred to as thermoelectric
power, electrical conductivity, and the absolute work temperature,
respectively. In addition, k is the sum of electrical
thermal conductivity (ke) and lattice
(or phonon) thermal conductivity (kl).
The electrical conductivity (σ) and electrical thermal conductivity
(ke) are associated by the Wiedemann–Franz
law: ke = LσT, where L is the Lorentz number, its most
typical value is 2.45 × 10–8 W Ω K2 for metals and degenerate semiconductors.4,5 It
is clear that a good thermoelectric material needs to have a large
Seebeck coefficient (S) and electrical conductivity
(σ) and also should have low thermal conductivity (k = ke + kl) at the same time. Theoretical and experimental results show that ZT can be improved by using band engineering and structure
designs to increase S2σ (often know
as power factor and abbreviated as PF) and/or decrease k.6−8

FeAsS is a mineral sulfide with arsenic containing mineral
on Earth.
Previous studies show that FeAsS is a diamagnetic semiconductor with
indirect band gap.9−11 It is crystallized in the monoclinic structure of
space group p21/c with four formula
units (Z = 4) per unit.9,10,12 In addition, it has a considerably higher Seebeck
coefficient as well as variable but not high resistivity.13 Considering the considerably higher Seebeck
coefficient and variable but not high resistivity, the thermoelectric
figure of merit ZT should be significant.

Motivate
by the found properties of FeAsS with a considerably higher
Seebeck coefficient and variable but not high resistivity. In this
paper, we focus our attention on the study of the electronic structure
and thermoelectric properties of FeAsS, finding the low lattice thermal
conductivity and anisotropic ZT, and p-type doping
having better thermoelectric performance than n-type doping.

2 Results and Discussion
FeAsS is in the monoclinic structure
of space group p21/c with four formula
units (Z = 4) per unit, as
shows in Figure 1a,b,
and the lattice parameters are a = 5.74 Å, b = 5.67 Å, c = 5.76 Å, which
is consistent with previous result.11 The
atomic positions of FeAsS are shown in Table 1.

Considering the possible influence of spin orbital
coupling (SOC)
on the electron transport coefficient,14,15 first, we
calculate the energy band structures with or without SOC, as displayed
in Figure 1c, finding
that the SOC makes the whole band slightly move up, but the shape
and the band gap of the energy band structures are almost unchanged,
which means that the SOC has an inconsiderable effect on the thermoelectric
properties of FeAsS; thus, we do not consider the SOC in the thermoelectric
calculation below.

It can be found from the electronic band
structure shown in Figure 1c,d that FeAsS is
a semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 0.73 eV and it is a little
less than the value of 0.75 or 0.78 eV of previous studies.9,10 This moderate band gap means the thermoelectric performance can
be optimized within a reasonable doping level. We note that the density
of states (DOS) in the entire energy range mostly originate from the
d orbital of the Fe atom, what is more, the valence bands exhibit
much higher DOS than the conduction bands which implies that the p-type-doped
thermoelectric performance is superior to that of n-type doped.

Figure 2a–c
shows the electrical conductivity of p-type and n-type FeAsS along
the x-, y- and z-directions as the function of carrier concentration at different
temperatures of 300, 600, and 900 K. We noticed that the electrical
conductivity increases with carrier concentration and temperature
for both p-type and n-type of FeAsS. The electrical conductivity along
the x- and y-directions is on the
order of 106; the electrical conductivity along the z-direction is an order of magnitude less than that along
the x- and y-directions. We observe
that the electrical conductivity of p-type FeAsS along the x- and y-directions is always greater than
that of n-type FeAsS. For the z-direction at 600
and 900 K, the situation is opposite to that of the x- and y-directions. In the z-direction
at 900 K, p-type is higher when the carrier concentration is less
than 3.5 × 1021 cm–3 and as the
carrier concentration continues to increase, n-type will be greater.

Figure 2 (a–c)
Electrical conductivity of p-type and n-type FeAsS
along the x-, y-, and z-directions as the function of the carrier concentration at the temperatures
of 300, 600, and 900 K. (d–f) Electrical thermal conductivity
of p-type and n-type FeAsS along the x-, y-, and z-directions as the function of
the carrier concentration at the temperatures of 300, 600, and 900
K.

The electrical conductivity is
proportional to carrier concentration
and inversely proportional to (m*)5/2; m* (m* = ℏ2/(∂2E/∂k2))
is effective mass of carriers which is related to the flatness of
the band.16 Therefore, we can qualitatively
analyze the electrical conductivity from the change trend of energy
band. The valence band is closer to Fermi level than the conduction
band as displayed in Figure 1c,d. According to the Fermi–Drake distribution function,
the closer to the Fermi level, the greater the carrier concentration.
Therefore, the carrier concentration of the valence band is greater
than the conduction band. The slope change of the valence band is
more prominent than the conduction band along the high symmetric path
of Z–Γ and Γ–Y, but the slope change of the conduction band is more conspicuous
along Y–A (Figure 1c). The effective mass of valence
band is greater than that of conduction band of the x- and y-directions, but the situation is opposite
for the c-direction. The analysis results are consistent
with our calculations, which manifests that FeAsS has appropriate
electrical conductivity.8

Figure 2d–f
displays the electrical thermal conductivity of p-type and n-type
FeAsS along the x-, y-, and z-directions at the temperatures of 300, 600, and 900 K.
The electrical conductivity (σ) and electrical thermal conductivity
(ke) are associated by the Wiedemann–Franz
law: ke = LσT, where L is the Lorentz number, its most
typical value is 2.45 × 10–8 W Ω K2 for metals and degenerate semiconductors;4,5 therefore,
the change of electrical thermal conductivity is only slightly different
from that of electrical conductivity.

From Figure 3, we
can obtain that a phase transfer occurs by changing carrier concentration.
Generally, the value of Seebeck coefficient should be larger than
200 μV K–1 for promising thermoelectric materials.17 Instructively, in our study, the average value
of Seebeck coefficient for FeAsS in the whole temperature and carrier
concentration range is almost larger than 200 μV K–1, which indicates that there may be high values of PF and ZT as we expect.

FeAsS along (a) x-, (b) y-, and
(c) z-direction
as a function of carrier concentration at the temperatures of 300,
600, and 900 K.

Take one-dimensional
double atomic chain as the example,18−20 the relationship between
frequency and wavenumber is given as follows 1  

From the above expression, we can obtain that the frequency
gap
between the acoustic phonon module and the optical phonon module is
mainly determined by the atomic mass difference of the material components.
In addition, the frequency range of phonon spectrum is related to
the interaction between the atoms and the atomic mass difference in
the material components. The one-dimensional double atomic chain analysis
is also instructive for qualitative analysis of other three-dimensional
multiatomic chains.

After careful analysis of the calculated
phonon dispersion shown
in Figure 4a,b, we
find the coupling existing in FeAsS between optical phonon modes and
acoustic phonon modes. It implies that there is little difference
in the mass of the constituent atoms and that the interactions between
the atoms are relatively small. The weak interaction between atoms
is not conducive to the transmission of phonons. However, the frequency
range of phonon modules is relatively large, but the frequency range
of acoustic branches is 0–5 THz which is relatively small and
the slope of the phonon spectrum is larger along Z–G–Y. It’s
worth noting that phonons have less state density in the frequencies
of acoustic branches. Thus, we can conclude that FeAsS should have
a small lattice thermal conductivity.

along high symmetry direction.
(b) Total and partial DOS. (c) Temperature dependence of lattice thermal
conductivity. (d) Cumulative lattice thermal conductivity of FeAsS
as a function of the phonon frequency at 300 K.

The intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity of FeAsS is calculated
by using ShengBTE code.21 As shown in Figure 4c,d, the lattice
thermal conductivity is anisotropic and the lattice thermal conductivity
is largest along the z-direction, followed by the x-direction, and the smallest lattice thermal conductivity
is along the y-direction. What is more in all directions,
the lattice thermal conductivity is smaller than 1 W m–1 K–1, which is extremely low. Moreover, from Figure 4d, we obtain that
the majority contribution frequency of lattice thermal conductivity
is below 8 THz, some of the optical branching phonon contribute a
lot to the lattice thermal conductivity, but most of the contribution
comes from the acoustical branch.

Figure 5 reveals
that ZT for p-type is superior to that for n-type,
which is consistent with previous analysis of energy band and DOS,
where there is much higher DOS of the valence bands than that of the
conduction bands around the Fermi level. In addition, we notice that
there is only a slight difference between the ZT values
along the x-direction and y-direction,
the optimal ZT along the x- and y-directions for p-type are 0.84 and 0.82 and for n-type
are 0.62 and 0.71, respectively. The optimal ZT along
the z-direction for p-type and n-type are 0.63 and
0.59. ZT value along the x- and y-directions is significantly larger than that along the z-direction. The results show that FeAsS is a good thermoelectric
material.

3 Conclusions
To summarize,
we have adopted first-principles and Boltzmann transport
theory to synthetically study the electronic structure and thermoelectric
properties of FeAsS. The results show that FeAsS is a semiconductor
with an indirect band gap of 0.73 eV. We also can draw conclusions
from the results: (1) FeAsS has an appropriate electrical conductivity
which is smaller than 5 × 105 Ω–1 m–1. (2) The average value of Seebeck coefficient
in the whole temperature and carrier concentration range is almost
greater than 200 μV K–1. (3) Lattice thermal
conductivity is anisotropic. What is more, in all directions, the
lattice thermal conductivity is smaller than 1 W m–1 K–1, which is extremely low. (4) The thermoelectric
figure of merit ZT has obvious anisotropy, and p-type
doping has better thermoelectric performance than n-type doping. ZT for p-type doping along the x-, y-, and z-directions can reach 0.84, 0.82,
and 0.63, respectively, ZT for n-type doping along
the x-, y-, and z-directions can also reach 0.62, 0.71, and 0.59, respectively. These
results show that FeAsS has potential application in thermoelectric
material.

4 Computational Approach
The structure
is optimized by using first-principles density functional
theory22,23 in combination with projector-augmented-wave24 pseudopotentials, and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof25,26 exchange correlation functional is used, which is implemented in
Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).27−30 We choose a 13 13choo13 Monkhorst–Pack k-mesh. The plane-wave energy cutoff is set to 450 eV. The
lattice parameters and the atomic positions are fully optimized until
the maximum Hellmann–Feynman forces exerted on each atom less
than 1 × 10–6 eV/Å. The electronic band
structure is calculated based on the optimized structure, and the k-grid is set to 31 o 31is 31. After the structural optimization
and the electronic band structure calculation, we carry out the electronic
transport properties calculation by using BoltzTraP code.31 In addition, we adopt self-consistent single
parabolic band (SCF-SPB) model to calculate electron relaxation time
(τ)32−36 2   3  where Cii, m* , and El (El = ΔE/(Δl/l0)) are
elastic matrix constant,
effective mass, and deformation potential, respectively. Calculated
results of all parameters are filled in Table 2.

We calculate the phonon spectrum of FeAsS
in terms of harmonic
approximation which is implemented in the Phonopy code.37 In addition, the lattice thermal conductivity
is calculated by solving the phonon Boltzmann transport equation,
which is performed by ShengBTE code.21 The
second-order harmonic interatomic force constants (IFCs) and third-order
anharmonic IFCs are calculated from the atomic forces by the finite
displacement approach, a 2 × 2 × 2 super cell containing
96 atoms based on the optimized structure is used. The k-mesh tested was 9 × 9 × 9 to 15 × 15 × 15 in
the ShengBTE code. Further increase in k-grid would
cause the change of lattice thermal conductivity by less than 0.7%.
Therefore, the best q-mesh for convergence is 15
× 15 × 15 for FeAsS.
