A general
adsorption model based on partial dissociation was developed
for carboxylic acids. The model was applied to the adsorption of nonanoic
acid at the air/water interface. Two cases were selected for experimental
verification: acid-only and acid with a constant Na+OH– concentration. The model was applied simultaneously
at both conditions, and the hydrophilicity of the ionic states was
quantified by the adsorption constants, KA and KAH. It was found that the adsorption
constant for the acidic group is significantly higher than that for
the carboxylate group, KAH/KA ∼ 272. The model lays important groundwork for
modeling and predicting carboxylic/carboxylate adsorption.

Introduction
The adsorption of anionic surfactants
at the air/water interface
has been a key phenomenon for the soap and detergent industry. In
the history of chemistry, the anionic surfactant is probably the first
synthesized chemical on records,1 with
natural soap having been produced since ancient times in Mesopotamia.
An example of the recorded recipe2 is shown
in Figure 1. The action
of soaps is still experienced in industrial and household activities3 with modern detergents. However, despite a long
history of applications, the nature of these surfactants at the air/water
interface remains inadequately described.

In the literature, thermodynamic
analysis4 is often applied to quantify
the adsorbed concentration of surfactant 1  where R is the ideal gas
constant, T is the temperature, γ is the surface
tension, Cb is the bulk concentration,
Γ is the surface excess concentration, and n is the prefactor.5 The prefactor n depends on the ionic nature of the
surfactant, with values of 1 and 2 for nonionic and ionic surfactants,
respectively.6

Carboxylic acids,
with a partial ionization, exist in an equilibrium
between associated (carboxylic) and dissociated (carboxylate) forms.
Hence, eq 1 with a constant
prefactor, either 1 or 2, is not appropriate. Because the equilibrium
is concentration-dependent, the degree of ionization is different
from the bulk to the surface. Due to the increase of concentration
at the surface, the associated fraction should be higher at the surface
than in the bulk. This has been validated with amino acids:7 the carboxylic acid group is ionized at a significantly
higher pH at the surface than in the bulk. As a result, the adsorption
model of a binary mixture,8 which excludes
the conversion between the two surfactants, is not suitable either.

The lack of a theoretical model prevents an effective validation
of the hydrophilicity of carboxylic and carboxylate groups. It is
well accepted that surfactant adsorption is governed by a balance
between the hydrophobic tail and the hydrophilic head. Hydrophobicity
is directly correlated with hydrocarbon length,9 whereas hydrophilicity is largely unquantified. The hydrophilicity
is qualitatively related to the solvation/solubility of head groups.
As a result, an ionized state, with a higher solubility, would have
a higher hydrophilicity than the nonionized state. The most significant
result for hydrophilicity was obtained a few decades ago with alkyl
phenols (CxH2x+1C6H4OH) and alkyl phenolates (CxH2x+1C6H4O–).10 The dissociated
state, phenolate, requires at least four carbons (x > 4) to become surface active. On the other hand, the associated
state is surface active with x = 0 (phenol) or 1
(p-cresol).11 Hence, four
carbons in the hydrophobic tail are required to balance the increased
“hydrophilicity” from phenol to phenolate.

The
ionization degree and adsorption are coupled to the equilibrium
of the system to quantify the adsorption of these weak electrolytes.
As far as we are aware, there is only one quantification method in
the literature,12 which is based on a thermodynamic
model. However, the method requires the surface tension of pure surfactant. Consequently, the method is applicable
for liquid acids only, with up to four carbons for monocarboxylic
and five carbons for dicarboxylic acids, respectively. There are no
quantitative methods to model the relative adsorption of longer-chain
carboxylic acids, which exist in the solid form at room temperature.

In summary, there is no theoretical prediction of the adsorption
or hydrophilicity of long-chain carboxylic acids and their conjugate
bases. This study focuses on the adsorption of nonanoic acid. The
acid was selected for several reasons. First, it is partially dissociated
under normal conditions. Hence, both ionized and nonionized species
exist, at significant percentages, in the bulk. Second, the dissociation
constant can be determined by pH measurements. Finally, the carboxylic
acid remains an important and economical surfactant for commercial
soaps and detergents.3 A proper understanding
of the relative adsorption at the air/water interface can lead to
important applications of soap at both the oil/water and solid/water
interfaces.

Because these ionic states exist in equilibrium,
separate quantification
at the interface is impossible. Hence, a new model is needed to simultaneously
account for both interfacial adsorption and reaction equilibria.13 A successful model can provide important information
on the relative adsorption between different ionic states of the surfactant
head.

Theoretical Modeling
In this analysis, the ionization
reaction, AH + H2O
↔ A– + H3O+, is incorporated
into the adsorption process. The equilibria in the bulk and within
the interfacial zone (Figure 1) are governed by the reaction constant13 2  where ka is the
reaction constant (M) and Ci (i = A, H3O, and AH) are the bulk concentrations of their respective
species.

Although water is also involved in the reaction, the
concentration
of water as a solvent is too large (∼55 M) to be affected by
acid ionization. Accordingly, water is not included in the reaction
equilibrium. The value of ka can be obtained
by routine pH measurements and used to compute the exact composition
between CA and CAH in the bulk. The thermodynamic analysis, eq 1, is applied to the system of all
species 3  Hence, all species (ionized
acid, neutralized
acid, and ions) have to be included in the model. In this study, the
partial ionic binding is applied.14 The
interfacial zone can be divided into two layers (Figure 2): (i) the outer layer, which
contains surfactant tails and the water surface, and (ii) the inner
layer, which contains the surfactant heads and other ions. Both layers
are part of the interfacial zone and thus included in eq 3. The surface adsorption of each
species is governed by an equilibrium between the number of vacant
sites on the surface and the species concentration.14 In this case, the adsorption is based on hydrophobic tails.
Hence, the equilibria are given by 4   5  where Γv is the
number of
vacant sites (mol/m2) and KA and KAH are adsorption constants (M–1).

Figure 2 Adsorption of carboxylic acid at the air/water interface.

Total available sites on the surface,
Γmax, is
given by 6  Combining with
the above equations 7  Consequently,
the adsorbed concentrations
of two species are given by 8   9  The above two
equations follow the Langmuir
isotherm for binary mixtures.8

The
adsorption system has three adsorption parameters: KA, KAH, and Γmax. If only the salt-free solution is used, one would get
a single set of data and the fitting of the theoretical model would
be unreliable. Consequently, the study employs another set of conditions:
an excessive and hence essentially constant concentration of NaOH.
The condition can be experimentally maintained. The condition of excessive
concentration of NaOH is a step in the historical production of natural
soaps, such as in Figure 1,1 and the constant Na+ concentration can significantly simplify the governing equations.
In both cases, eq 3 can
be further simplified and used to calculate the adsorption. The model
can be applied simultaneously to both conditions to obtain the adsorption
constants for both species.

Acid-Only Solution
The salt-free
solution contains
only three species: A–, AH, and H3O+. Neutrality requires ΓA = ΓH3O+ and CA = CH3O+. Because ka is constant, d(ln CAH) = 2d(ln CA). Substitution
of these terms into eq 3 results in 10  The concentration
of ionized acid, CA, can also be calculated
from the total acid
concentration, Cb (Cb = CA + CAH), and eq 2 11  The positive root of the above equation is 12  Hence, the total adsorption, Γtotal = ΓA + ΓAH, can be obtained as
a function of CA from eqs 8–10, and 12.

Acid with a Constant Concentration
of Na+
Four species are presented in the system
with high NaOH concentrations:
A–, AH, Na+, and OH–. All hydronium ions are presumed to be neutralized by the excessive
OH–. If the bulk concentrations of all four species
are variable, eq 3 would
result in a complicated form. However, if Na+ is maintained
constant in the bulk, d ln CNa = 0, then Na+ is no longer involved in eq 3. The conditions of constant CNa and variable Cb can be experimentally obtained and consequently were selected for
this study. Therefore, eq 3 reduces to 13  Under an alkali condition, eq 2 reduces to 14  where kw is hydrolysis
constant of water (kw = 10–14). The balance of charges gives 15  Substituting CAH (CAH = Cb – CA) and COH from eq 15 into eq 14 16  Equation 16 can be used to calculate the corresponding CA at any given value of Cb and CNa. Differentiating the
logarithmic term of eq 14 gives 17  Equation 13 is simplified as 18  Neutrality in the interfacial layer also requires 19  Hence, eq 18 reduces to 20  Because Na+ ions
are located further
inside the bulk, one can relate ΓNa to the bulk concentration.
Consequently 21  where λs is the effective
thickness of the interfacial layer. The value of λs is corroborated later with experimental results.

Fitting Procedure
A fitting procedure is applied to
both experimental data simultaneously. Because the experimental data
only presents the γ-versus-Cb relationship,
further conversion is required from surface tension. The overall fitting
procedure consists of the following steps1. In case of acid-only, the corresponding CA is calculated by eq 12. Consequently, the surface tension data
are obtained as a function of CA (i.e.,
γ vs CA)

2. In case of constant Na+, CA and CAH are obtained
from Cb and CNa using the bisection method. Consequently, the correlations between
d ln(CA) versus d ln(Cb) and d ln(CAH) versus d ln(Cb) are obtained.
As shown later on, both d ln(CA) versus d ln(Cb) and d ln(CAH) versus d ln(Cb) are linear and easy to obtain.

3. The surface tensions under both conditions
are fitted to experimental data via eqs 10 and 20, respectively.
The adsorption was then fitted to find Γmax, ΓNa, KA, and KAH.



Experimental Section
Materials
Nonanoic acid and sodium hydroxide solution
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Acid purity was specified as ≥98.0%,
and the sample was used without further purification. Water was purified
by an Ibis ultrapure system (conductivity > 17.5 MΩ cm).

Methods
The main focus of this study was on obtaining
the surface tension below the critical micelle concentration (CMC)
under both unadjusted and high concentrations of NaOH. Due to different
solubilities, the following two experimental methods were employed
to measure the surface tension: the Wilhelmy plate method and the
pendant bubble method. Both methods have been described in detail
in the literature.

As discussed in Introduction, nonanoic acid is difficult to dissolve at room temperature. To
dissolve acid into water, the acid/water mixture was first sonicated
and heated to 60 °C. The solution was then allowed to cool to
room temperature (25 °C). At high concentrations, >2 mM, some
residue was observed on water surface. With decreasing concentration,
the residue was gradually reduced to a point at which it was no longer
observable. This critical concentration was around ∼2 mM. Hence,
a specific setup and procedure were used (Figure 3) to overcome the uncertainties around this
critical limit. The method is based on the pendant shape of an air
bubble formed after cooling. The apparatus consisted of a video camera,
an optical rail for proper alignment, a light source, syringe, needle,
plastic cuvette, pH meter (Aqua-pH from TPS Instruments Ltd.), and
an electrode.8

Figure 3 Experimental setup for
the pendant bubble method.

The starting concentration was 2 mM. After cooling, an air
bubble
was formed at the end of a needle submerged in the solution. Further
dilution was obtained by adding a controlled quantity of water to
the initial solution and stirring. After stirring, a new pendant bubble
was formed in the solution. In this procedure, any excessive and nonsoluble
acid will stay on the water surface, not on the surface of the newly
formed bubble. A stainless steel needle with a nominal outer diameter
of 1.8 mm, which was attached to a syringe, was used, and a pH sensor
was also submerged inside the solution. Several air bubbles were formed
at each concentration, and multiple images were taken of each bubble
for analysis. Surface tension was calculated from the drop shape using
a MATLAB code. The average values and standard deviations were obtained
for all images (more than 20 images) at each concentration.

For higher-concentration experiments, the surface tension was measured
using the normal Wilhelmy plate method on a Sigma 710 tensiometer
(NIMA KSV), fitted with an automatic dispenser.15 The starting solution contained 0.33 M of Na+ with an initial pH of 14.45. The stock solution was prepared by
adding acid into the above solution to bring the concentration to
0.3 M. The mixture was then pumped gradually onto a measurement beaker,
allowing the surface tension at acid concentrations ranging from 0
to 0.27 M to be obtained at a constant concentration of Na+.

Results
General Observation
The surface
tension data for both
cases are presented together in Figure 4. For constant concentrations of Na+ (0.33
M), the solubility was greater than 0.3 M. In this instance, the acid
is fully ionized and soluble. The region around CMC (∼0.2 M)
demonstrated a typical dip of anionic surfactants.16 For the acid-only solution, low acid solubility precluded
the measurement of surface tension above 1.8 mM, which is 2 orders
of magnitude lower than the basic case. It should be noted that the
lowest surface tension, around 0.85 mM, might not correspond to the
critical micelle concentration. Instead, the region may indicate surface
aggregation or limited solubility.

concentration.

Solubility and Association
Constant
The surface tension
in Figure 4 indicates
that the surface is not saturated for Cb < 0.9 mM. Hence, pH data up to 0.8 mM were used to quantify the
ionization constant. The ionization constant was obtained (Figure 5) by fitting the experimental
data to the following equation 22  The ionization constant, ka, was obtained as 1.7 × 10–5 M
with a corresponding pKa of 4.77, in good
agreement with the pKa of 4.96 reported
for nonanoic acid17 and consistent with
the current literature on carboxylic acids.18

Modeling Surface Tension
The interference of micelles
or aggregates with surfactant adsorption remains a controversial issue
in the literature. On the basis of the neutron reflectometry analysis
of anionic surfactants,16 the adsorption
should remain unsaturated to ∼80% of CMC. Because the theoretical
model in this study was only applicable to unsaturated adsorption,
the lower ranges (up to 0.2 M and 0.9 mM for constant Na+ and acid-only conditions, respectively) were selected for modeling.

First, the surface tension in Figure 4 is recalculated as a function of CA for acid-only solutions. Under the constant
Na+ condition, CA and CAH are solved numerically, as shown in Figure 6a.

Figure 6 Correlations between CA/CAH and nonanoic
acid concentration under constant NaOH
condition: (a) linear and (b) logarithmic–logarithmic scale.

Consequently, the measured surface
tension (from Figure 4) is expressed as a function
of CA for both cases.
Polynomial fittings are then applied to the data (Figure 7). The slope of the surface
tension data was then obtained by differentiating the polynomial functions.

Figure 7 Surface
tension as a function of CA for nonanoic acid.

Under the acid-only condition, the slope is used
to calculate the
adsorbed concentration, ΓA + ΓAH, as in eq 10. Under
the condition of constant NaOH, we have 23   24  It
can be seen that both correlations are
linear as β1 = 1.00 and β2 = 1.04
(Figure 6b). By substitution
into eq 20, we have 25  Combining with the isotherms, one
obtains 26  Equations 10 and 26 were applied to both
curves simultaneously. The fitting parameters are Γmax, ΓNa, KA, and KAH. The best-fitted results are tabulated in Table 1.

The
data for both conditions are shown in Figure 8. Different values of λs (0.3, 0.5, and 1 nm) were used. It can be seen that the variation
has a limited impact on adsorption constants.

Figure 8 Modeling nonanoic acid
adsorption.

The model describes both
cases successfully, excepting the low
acid concentration at constant CNa+. The differences may arise from variation in λs. Although CNa+ is constant,
the values of ΓA and ΓOH vary correspondingly
(Figure 9). Consequently,
the value of λs changes with acid concentration.
However, a proper valuation of λs would require detailed
quantification of ionic pairings, which can only be obtained via molecular
simulations.19 In any case, the variation
of λs should be limited to a distance of a few angstroms
and has a minimal impact on the adsorption constant. With λs fixed at 3, 5, and 10 Å, the adsorption constants vary
only marginally, as shown in Table 1. The deviation between eq 26 and experimental data at low CA (in Figure 8) can also be explained by the variation of λs. At low acid concentrations, the interfacial layer is dominated
by Na+ and OH–, which form H-bonds with
surface water. The disruption of H-bonds affects the surface tension20 and thus deviates the data from modeled prediction.

arrangement of carboxylate and ions around the interface.

Discussion
The final values shown
in Table 1 are physically
realistic. First of all, the value
of Γmax should be related to the size of the surfactant.
The obtained value was in the same order of Γmax as
reported for all comparable surfactants.21 The value of KAH was significantly higher
than KA, as expected. As both species
have the same alkyl tail, the increased adsorption constant corresponds
to the decreased hydrophilicity of the group. In this instance, the
ratio between the equilibrium constants of the carboxylic and carboxylate
groups is given by KAH/KA ∼ 272. In the literature, the surface energies
for carboxylic and carboxylate states have been obtained via a thermodynamic
equilibrium model.12 The reported ratios
are 14 and 213 for CHOOH and CH3COOH, respectively. The
reported ratios are significantly higher (∼20 000 times)
for propionic and butyric acids, which may be explained by the uncertainties
in the activity coefficients. Furthermore, both propionic and butyric
acids have an apparent CMC, whereas acetic and formic acids show a
gradual reduction in the surface tension of the pure acid solution.
As mentioned earlier, the thermodynamic method requires the surface
tension of the pure surfactant22 and fits
very well for short-chain acids. Because C8H17COOH is a solid at room temperature, a direct comparison between
the two models is not possible. Nevertheless, the order of magnitude
between the two adsorption constants in this work is consistent with
the surface energies determined from the thermodynamic model.

The modeling results indicated that AH is more surface active than
A–. This is consistent with the general hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity
balance. The degree of ionization within the interfacial zone can
be related back to the surface charge and should be collaborated with
a surface potential.23 The proposed model
can be applied to other pH conditions, for instance, in the intermediate
pH range. Furthermore, different cations can be used to quantify the
impact of water hardness on soap dissociation.24 The theoretical framework can be also extended to dynamic
adsorption,18 by combining the diffusion
process and chemical reaction kinetics. The chemical reaction can
be the physical nature of the “barrier-limited” adsorption,
which has been proposed in the literature over the last three decades.21 In addition to the air/water interface, the
above framework can be applied to oil/water interfaces. In this case,
the adsorption constant is related to the balance between oleophilicity
and hydrophilicity of the surfactant molecules.

Conclusions
A
new model was proposed for the adsorption of carboxylic acid
at the air/water interface. The model was successfully applied at
two physical conditions simultaneously, and the adsorption constants
for both neutralized and ionized acids were successfully quantified.
The ratio of the adsorption constants of the carboxylic acid to its
carboxylate form was calculated to be ∼272 for nonanoic acid.
The model lays important groundwork for modeling soap adsorption for
the air/water and oil/water interfaces. By extending the method, the
adsorption and action of carboxylic detergents can be comprehensively
described at different pHs.
