Gas-hydrate formation has numerous
potential applications in the fields of water desalination, capturing
greenhouse gases, and energy storage. Hydrogen bonds between water
and guest gas are essential for hydrates to form, and their presence
in any system is greatly influenced by the presence of either electrolytes
or inhibitors in the liquid or impurities in the gas phase. This study
considers CH4 as a gaseous impurity in the gas stream employed
to form hydrates. In developing gas-hydrate formation processes to
serve multiple purposes, CO2 hydrate formation experiments
were conducted in the presence of another hydrate-forming gas, CH4, at low concentrations in saline water. These experiments
were conducted in both batch and stirred tank reactors in the presence
of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as a kinetic additive at 3.5 MPa and 274.15 K, under isobaric
and isothermal conditions. Gas loading was taken as the detection
criterion for hydrate formation. It was observed that overall gas
loading was hindered by more than 70% with the addition of salts after
2 days. The addition of CH4 to the gas stream led to a
further reduction of approximately 30% of gas loading in the batch
reactor under quiescent conditions. However, the addition of 100 ppm
of SDS improved the gas loading by recovering 34% of the loss observed
in volumetric gas loading through the addition of salts and CH4. The introduction of stirring improved the gas loading, and
64% of the loss was recovered through the addition of salts and CH4 after 34 h. The investigation was continued further by substituting
CH4 with N2, whereupon accelerated hydrate formation
was observed.

1 Introduction
Gas
hydrates are crystalline compounds that are formed from a combination
of single or mixed guest gases with water, generally in high-pressure
and low-temperature conditions.1 Despite
being perceived as an issue to be solved in the transportation of
natural gas, hydrate formation has attracted wide-ranging research
interest since the discovery of its applications in energy storage
and transportation, water desalination, and environmental sciences.2−5 Due to its ability to selectively separate various gases depending
upon thermodynamic conditions, hydrate formation has applications
involving the separation of gases, such as CO2 capture,
the recovery of CH4 from natural gas hydrates, and the
storage and safe transportation of CH4 using hydrates.
However, the main drawbacks are thermodynamic (the heat of formation
of hydrates) and physical [heterogeneous hydrate formation at the
gas–liquid (g-l) interface], along with the need for high-pressure
conditions and the unavailability of a reactor design for continuous
hydrate formation.6−9

Even though, theoretically, hydrate formation is an exothermic
process, its application for the intended purposes was in question
due to the requirements of a high driving force. To improve the hydrate
formation in terms of its yield and lowering the induction time, numerous
studies were done using different guest gases,10−14 chemical additives such as kinetic and thermodynamic
additives,4,15−18 and physical interventions using
stirring, porous media, nanotubes, nanoparticles, and hydrate formation
in dry water and dry gel.19−22 Despite being effective in improving the overall
yield, porous media, microparticles, and nanoparticles could increase
the process cost for requiring an additional filtration process to
separate the particles from water.19 Moreover,
hydrate formation in the presence of nanoparticles could be effective
in the presence of stirring. However, stirring in the aqueous
phase with micro and nanoparticles could be excessively power-consuming
because the liquid phase is highly viscous, whereas it is impossible
in the presence of porous media.19 Even
it is stated that the energy requirement for stirring increases as
the hydrate grows, making the overall aqueous-hydrate phase more viscous
with time.23 Hence, in this study, we have
focused on the intervention that does not require additional separation
processes and quiescent and stirred systems for the comparative analysis
both in terms of initial kinetics and temporal yield.

With respect
to desalination, CO2-based hydrate formation comes under
the category of freeze desalination where desalted water can be extracted
from three steps of crystalline CO2 hydrate formation,
hydrate washing, and dissociation. This advanced freezing technique
comes with an advantage of not demanding low temperatures while a
disadvantage of requiring high-pressure conditions. The presence of
CO2 in the desalination process has the advantage of capturing
acidic gases without requiring lower temperatures as much as conventional
water freezing; however, high compressions are required, which, in
turn, increase the energy consumption.10 Through various experiments, salt removal rates of 60–80%
have been observed in the first stage, which have been further improved
up to 97% through later stages.11,12 In addition to the
physical interventions, various chemicals are added to the systems
to improve the hydrate formation rates as well as yields. While kinetic
additives improved the hydrate yield by encouraging the gas diffusivity
in the aqueous phase without forming hydrates themselves, thermodynamic
additives both improved the yield and minimized the induction time
by forming hydrates.24 As most of these
thermodynamic additives are liquids, the effluent hydrate slurry requires
further distillation to produce clean water. Especially, the chemical
toxicity induced by these additives could potentially harm humans,
making the effluent water not potable. Hence, the study considered
only kinetic additives in the sensitivity analysis to keep the results
suitable for the application in desalination. For its economic viability,
availability, and efficiency in supporting hydrate formation, SDS
is considered as the kinetic additive in our sensitivity studies.25

Gases such as propane, SF6, and HFC-forming
hydrates can be used for desalination without requiring high compressions.
However, their relative scarcity in nature or in industrial emissions
would make their usage as the main hydrate expensive.26 In addition, HFCs and CFCs are environmentally harmful
and encouraging their production for use in desalination would lead
to greater environmental concerns.27 Moreover,
the tiny and dendritic SII hydrates formed by propane and CFCs make
separation from the brine solution extremely difficult. Even if they
are separated, the brine samples trapped inside the hydrate structures
are hard to be removed, lessening the practicability of the industrial
hydrate-based desalination using these gases.28 By addressing these issues, we have considered another easy hydrate
former, CO2, in this study. Instead of taking pure CO2 for the study, which would be profoundly an ideal case, we
have considered a 95% pure CO2 with 5% CH4 or
N2 in the gas stream. This is because the CO2 produced by most of the CO2 capture processes is not
pure.29 It also serves to understand the
sensitivity of hydrate formation toward two gaseous impurities, distinguished
by the nature of their solubilities in water.

Finally, the main
aim of our study is to check the sensitivity of hydrate formation
toward various chemical and physical interventions: quiescent, addition
of CH4 to CO2 gas streams, addition of salt
to water, addition of SDS, introduction of stirring, and the substitution
of CH4 with N2. Hydrate formation studies under
quiescent conditions were conducted for two days to record the volumetric
gas consumption as the main observation. The kinetics observed from these systems were compared among themselves
to derive conclusions over their hydrate formation sensitivities,
which were further linked to physical and thermodynamic barriers that
arise during the hydrate formation event. The objective is to also
focus upon the effectiveness of stirring upon hydrate formation both
initially and after few hours to derive conclusions where the stirring
is effective.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
The experiments were conducted to study the
kinetics of CO2 hydrate formation in seawater with low
concentrations of CH4. CH4 was chosen as a pollutant
because combinations of CH4 and CO2 can be found
naturally in the ores such as crude oil wells and natural gas ores.30 Therefore, in addition to experiments with pure
CO2, a gas mixture of CO2 and CH4 was prepared with the composition shown in Table 1. The saline water was prepared according
to the seawater configuration mentioned by Nessim et al.23 However, only three salts with major contributions
to salinity were considered, whereas the rest were added to the molarity
of NaCl. The composition of saline water is shown in Table 1. To improve the hydrate formation
kinetics, 100 ppm of SDS was added to the liquid phase in the later
experiments. The properties of the components are shown in Table 2.

2.2 Operational Conditions
As high-temperature
and low-pressure conditions generally favor hydrate formation, the
system required either compression or refrigeration. In this study,
a temperature just above the freezing point was chosen to keep the
compression cost low.31

To check
the hydrate-forming condition of the CH4 and CO2 mixture, predictions were generated using the model proposed by
Chapoy et al. and are shown in Figure 1.32 The provision of merely
equilibrium pressure does not ensure hydrate formation as a driving
force was needed, which was considered to be the difference between
the experimental pressure and the equilibrium pressure.33

Figure 1 Equilibrium pressures of hydrates with gaseous pure components
and mixtures.

From the observations of Fakharian
et al. on CO2 hydrate formation, it was found that at pressures
as high as 5.5 MPa the system was observed to have formed unstable
CO2 hydrates, whereas at 3.5 MPa, a stable CO2 hydrate was formed.34 It is also worth
mentioning that the pressure of CH4 hydrate dissociation
to be 3.3 MPa, while it is 1.6 MPa for CO2 hydrate at 274.15
K for sea water with a salinity of 3.5 wt %. Given these factors,
the experiments were conducted at 3.5 MPa and 274.15 K to support
hydrate formation while discouraging CH4 hydrate formation.

2.3 Experimental Setup and Data Acquisition
An isothermal and isobaric system was considered for the experiments,
where hydrate formation was detected from gas loading or volumetric
gas consumption. Two jacketed-type reactor configurations were considered:
a rocking cell reactor for quiescent systems and a stirred tank reactor.

A jacketed rocking cell with a volume of 377 mL was considered
to conduct the quiescent hydrate formation studies. The rig was capable
of performing a 180° pneumatic rocking, which was used at the
time of gas dissolution. It had an operational temperature range of
203.15–323.15 K and a maximum pressure of 70 MPa. The coolant
sent from a cryostat was circulated through the jacket of the rig
to maintain the operational temperature. The cryostat was capable
of maintaining the cell temperature within a range of 0.05 K. To further
reduce heat transfer with the surroundings, the rig was insulated
with a polystyrene board on its outside, whereas a plastic foam covered
the connecting pipeline. A platinum resistance thermometer was positioned
in the jacket to monitor the temperature during hydrate formation
with an accuracy of ±0.05 K deviation. To measure pressure, a
Quartzdyne pressure transducer was used. The pressure was measured
with an accuracy of ±0.03 MPa. The temperature and pressure data
were recorded on a PC, which was connected through an RS 232 serial
port. Schematic diagrams of the experimental setup and the rocking
cell reactor are given in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Experimental setup configurations: (a) with the rocking
cell reactor, (b) for quiescent conditions, and (c) stirred tank reactor.

The reactor was connected to pressure and temperature
transducers and the temperature probe and controller, which was attached
to a refrigerator. A Quizix high-pressure syringe pump (Q6000-10K
model) was attached to the reactor by means of a gas supply cell to
maintain the system at the required pressure. The pump, temperature
controller, and pressure and temperature transducers were attached
to the data acquisition system. Detailed diagrams of the experimental
setups for both systems are provided in Figure 2.

For all experiments, the mass liquid
phase taken was 150 ± 0.2 g. Experiments were conducted in two
stages: dissolution and hydrate formation. In the dissolution phase,
the system was maintained at 285.15 K and 3.5 MPa to make sure that
there was no hydrate formation. For the rocking cell reactor, the
system was put into the continuous rocking mode while in the dissolution
phase. The internal volumes of the rocking cell and stirred tank reactors
were 377 and 525 mL, respectively. The stirred tank reactor consisted
of a jacketed-type rig with a volume of 525 mL. The rig was set with
a magnetic stirrer having an adjustable rotational speed that was
measured with respect to the viscosity of the test fluid. The maximum
allowable pressure was 69 MPa, whereas it had an operating temperature
range of 253.15–348.15 K. As in the rocking cell reactor, the
coolant from the cryostat was sent to the jacket to control and maintain
the temperature. A thermocouple with an accuracy of 0.1 K was placed
inside the reactor to monitor the operational temperature. The pressure
was monitored using a Quartzdyne pressure transducer, which had an
accuracy of ±0.015 MPa. To reduce further heat loss, the rig
was kept in another stainless steel container. To be able to monitor
temperature and pressure trends, the thermocouple and pressure transducers
were connected to a PC, which also collected torque data. Figure 1c shows a schematic
diagram of the stirred tank reactor.

A Quizix high-pressure
syringe pump (Q6000-10K model) was attached to the reactor by means
of a gas supply cell to maintain the system at the required pressure
conditions. Before starting each experiment, the reactors were cleaned
and vacuumed. The experiments were conducted in two stages: dissolution
and hydrate formation. In the dissolution phase, the system was maintained
at 285 K and 3.5 MPa to make sure that no hydrate formation occurred.
For the rocking cell reactor, the system was put into the continuous
rocking mode while in the dissolution phase.

A stirring speed
of 360 rpm was set throughout the experiment for the hydrate formation
under stirring conditions. Generally, gas dissolution took approximately
40–60 min. Once dissolution was completed in the rocking reactor,
rocking was stopped, and the reactor was set horizontally so as to
increase the gas–liquid interface. The temperature of the system
was set to 274.15 K, and the initial volumetric consumption at this
stage was set to zero. Generally, experiments were stopped after a
time period of 3 days, unless the system had reached a long-term quasisteady
state in terms of volumetric gas consumption before that. The volumetric
gas consumption and temperature and pressure fluctuations were recorded
and analyzed to check the kinetics of hydrate formation. In this study,
a total of five experiments were conducted, as listed in Table 3. To check the reproducibility
of these observations, the experiments were repeated once, which produced
similar results. Once the gas consumption data from the experiments
was collected, the volume of gas involved in hydrate formation was
calculated by eliminating the share of volumetric gas consumption
due to the gas contraction and gas dissolution during the temperature
drop as well as the volume consumption contributed by the contraction
of the hydrate–water phase during the hydrate formation. This
process was explained in the Discussion section.

3 Results and Discussion
In this section, the profiles of volumetric gas consumption during
hydrate formation in the experiments are discussed. As explained previously,
the value of volumetric gas consumption was set to zero before the
experimental temperature was changed to 274.15 K. Hence, the values
of volumetric gas consumption given are the result of the following
four phenomena that subsequently occur: (1) A shift in the vapor–liquid
equilibrium of the gas and liquid (further dissolution of gas into
the liquid); (2) contraction of the gas phase due to the temperature
drop; (3) hydrate formation; and (4) contraction of the hydrate–liquid
phase due to the formation of hydrates with higher density.

The experiments were conducted for two to three days depending upon
the status of volumetric gas consumption. However, all of the quiescent
systems were compared for a time period of two days, whereas this
was shortened to 34 h when comparing the stirring experiments due
to the premature cessation of stirring caused by excessive hydrate
formation in the system. The system with CO2 and distilled
water in quiescent conditions, which was discussed in a previous study,
was considered as the base case against which the rest of the systems
were compared.35

3.1 Experimental
Observations
Figure 3 shows how the presence of salt, CH4, and 100 ppm
of SDS in the system affected the kinetics of hydrate formation in
the systems. For the base case of CO2 and distilled water,
a total of 542 mL of gas consumption was observed, out of which 43
mL was the contribution of gas contraction after the temperature dropped
from 285.15 to 274.15 K. It is observed that the addition of salts
had a detrimental effect on hydrate formation. At the end of the second
day, the volumetric gas consumption was observed to be 148 mL, which
was almost 73% less than in the previous case. In the next experiment,
a 95 mol % CO2 + 5 mol % CH4 stream was used.
For this mixture, a further 29% fall in gas consumption compared to
the previous case was observed. In the literature, the effect of SDS
has been proven to enhance hydrate formation by decreasing the interfacial
tension within the liquid regime and hence improve the diffusion of
gas to the sites of hydrate formation.36 In support of such observations, when 100 ppm of SDS was added to
the system, gas consumption was increased to 2.28 times the value
observed in the CO2 + CH4 system in saline water.
This is equivalent to 34% of the volumetric gas consumption lost during
the addition of salts and CH4 to the system by the end
of the second day. This value was further increased to 52% at the
end of the next day.

Figure 3 Volumetric gas consumption by quiescent systems.

When comparing gas loading at the end of 34 h,
the reduction in the volumetric gas consumption with the addition
of salts was 78%. Addition of CH4 to the system further
reduced the volumetric gas consumption by 38%. Addition of SDS to
the system at this stage recovered 27% of the gas loading that was
lost during the addition of salts and CH4.

3.2 Barriers toward Hydrate Formation
There are three main
factors that can interfere with hydrate formation: the physical barrier,
heat generation, and heat distribution. The existing hydrate layer
represents a physical barrier to further gas dissolution into the
system, hence hindering further hydrate formation. Heat generation
occurs because hydrate formation is exothermic in nature. This can
be a potential hindrance to hydrate formation as the process is highly
sensitive to rises in temperature. Heat distribution is a major hindrance
to hydrate formation, especially in quiescent systems, when localized
high-temperature regimes occur. This made the hydrate formation sporadic,
especially after the first exponential volume consumption, where the
cycles of hydrate formation and dissociations or overall hydrate formation
with slower kinetics were seen for extended periods of time. The localization
of heat can be discouraged by introducing stirring into the system.
However, in our experiments, a temperature rise of 4 °C was observed
within the stirred tank reactor during the exponential phase of hydrate
formation, resulting in a drop in gas consumption. At the end of the
experiment, the stirred case was observed to have recovered 65% of
the volumetric gas consumption that was lost due to the addition of
the salts and CH4 to the system. This recovery is more
than 2.31 times that found in the quiescent system. Figure 4 illustrates how the introduction
of stirring improved the kinetics of hydrate formation.

Figure 4 Comparison
of volumetric gas consumption in the systems involving SDS with and
without stirring with the base case of CO2 + distilled
water.

In experiments using CO2 and CH4, Long and Sloan and Takeya et al. observed that
hydrate formation always started at the gas–liquid interface
at the wall and propagated either along the wall or along the gas–liquid
interface, depending upon the choice of guest gas and the presence
of kinetic additives in the system. When hydrates are propagated along
the gas–liquid interface, despite the porous nature of hydrates,
it is more probable to affect the further dissolution of CO2 into the solution.37,38 In the present experiments with
both quiescent and stirred systems, it was observed that hydrate formation
occurred and propagated along the reactor wall instead of at the gas–liquid
interface. Hence, the occurrence of physical interference can be ruled
out. This observation supports the suggestion by Ribeiro et al. and
Takeya et al. that hydrate formation with gases of low solubility
occurs at the gas–liquid interface due to the high availability
of dissolved gas there.39,40 Moreover, CO2 is a highly soluble gas, which forms hydrates along the reactor
walls, as is evidently the case here. However, from the volumetric
gas consumption profiles generated by the quiescent systems, it is
clear that the process of hydrate formation was not continuous but
sporadic. There were numerous periods of time during which the gas
consumption trends showed a quasidormant state with no or minimal
hydrate formation. With the g-l interface free for the mass transfer
of gas into the liquid without any hindrance offered by the hydrate,
the only possible explanation for this is the lack of the dissipation
of heat generated at the sites of hydrate formation. The effect of
heat generation has been considerably high for the systems with high
hydrate formations, where temperature rises of three to four degrees
were observed, resulting in a reduction of volumetric gas consumption.

3.3 Gas Consumption toward Hydrate Formation
It is important to note that the gas consumption that has been discussed
so far is the amount of gas injected into the reactor when the temperature
reached 274.15 K. Apart from hydrate formation, this gas was consumed
to compensate for the contraction of the gaseous phase due to the
temperature drop and the contraction of the hydrate–liquid
phase due to the density difference between the water-rich liquid
phase and the hydrate phase and also to solve extra gas into the system
during the temperature drop. The excess gas required to compensate
for the contraction of gas is calculated using eq 1, yielding values of 37.67 mL for the quiescent
system and 62.24 mL for the stirred system. 1  where Vex is the
excess volume needed to compensate for the contraction of the gaseous
phase, Z is the compressibility factor of the gas/gas
mixture, R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature, T0 is
the initial temperature, P is the pressure, and Vg is the total volume of the gaseous phase.

Before starting the experiment, the systems were given sufficient
time to reach vapor–liquid equilibrium. When the temperature
was set to 1 °C, the dissolution of further gas into the liquid
phase occurred before the temperature conditions suitable for hydrate
formation had been reached. Hence, the excess gas dissolution is assumed
to have happened without the presence of hydrates. A modified Duan
and Sun model is employed to calculate the excess volumetric gas consumption
contributed by dissolution of gas into liquid during the temperature
shift.41 When applying the model to calculate
the gas dissolution to systems with a mixture of CO2 and
CH4, a modified fugacity coefficient is used, which has
been taken from Ricaurte et al.42 The volumes
contributing to the changes in gas dissolution in the system were
calculated to be 0.392 mL for the CH4 + CO2 system
and 0.386 mL for the pure CO2 system in saline water. For
the CO2 and distilled water system, the excess volume due
to dissolution was 0.389 mL.

For the calculation of excess volume
due to the contraction of the hydrate–liquid phase due to the
formation of hydrates, an iterative process was chosen. The density
of hydrates was taken to be 1.10 g/cm3, whereas the density
of saline water was chosen to be 1.03 g/cm3.3,43 For the calculation of the number of moles of water converted into
hydrates given the s1 structure of hydrate formation, the stoichiometric
ratio of water to gas of 5.75:1 was used.22,44 Initially, the residual volumetric gas consumption values were derived
by subtracting the excess volumes of gas contraction and dissolution.
Volumes of water and hydrates were calculated by assuming that the
total residual gas consumption was used in the formation of hydrates.
The excess volumes were subtracted from the previous residual volume
consumption values to derive new residual volume consumption amounts.
After two iterations, the residual values were narrowed down to be
less than 0.002. After subtracting all of these excess volumes, the
volume of gas that participated in hydrate formation at the end of
34 h could be calculated, and the results are given in Table 4.

Table 4 Volume
of Gas Participating in Hydrate Formation after 34 h

6	CO2 + N2 + saline water + SDS	213.22 (after 21 h)	
The values
given in Table 4 show
the extent of hydrate formation at the end of the 34 h periods of
the experiments. Values of the efficiency of the physical interventions
and chemical additives in either enhancing or reducing hydrate formation
were calculated. At the end of 34 h, the addition of salts reduced
hydrate formation by 80%. This value was further reduced by 43% with
the introduction of 5 mol % CH4. With the addition of 100
ppm of SDS, 25% of the volumetric loss in hydrate formation due to
the addition of salts and 5 mol % CH4 was recovered. When
stirring was introduced, the recovery level rose to 57%, which is
2.3% higher than in the quiescent case. From these values, it is obvious
that the contributors for volume consumptions were quantitively different
for different systems.

3.4 Initial Hydrate Formation
Kinetics
Even though introduction of stirring was beneficial
for hydrate formation by improving the heat distribution throughout
the reactor, it was seen to have reduced heterogeneous hydrate formation.
Moreover, instantaneous heterogeneous hydrate formation was observed
in all of the quiescent experiments. This can be seen from the results
for gas consumption a few minutes after the temperature was set to
1 °C. However, this exponential increase in gas consumption was
not seen in stirred systems. To check this observation, volumetric
gas consumption profiles were plotted for the first 500 min and compared,
as shown in Figure 5. At 480 s, the volumetric gas consumption of the quiescent CO2 + distilled water system reached its local maximum (440 mL),
which then decreased due to the temperature rise, marking the end
of exponential hydrate formation. Hence, the first 500 s was chosen
for the comparison of exponential hydrate formation rates. The absence
of exponential hydrate formation might have been caused by the attrition
of the nuclei or turbulence along the reactor wall instigated by the
stirring, which might have decreased the static interaction between
the wall and the liquid phase. Even though the stirring discouraged
exponential hydrate formation in the initial stages, it was observed
that overall the hydrate formation occurred mostly near the wall.

Figure 5 Volumetric
gas consumption within the first 500 s of the experiment.

3.5 Comparison between CH4 and N2
Experiment 5 was repeated by substituting CH4 with N2 to check the effect of a gaseous impurity
with a lesser solubility in the system.10 This experiment was stopped after 21 h, and the values noted were
compared with the results from experiment 5. Studies such as that
by Ahmad and Gersen suggest that the extent of the dissolution of
CO2 is greatly reduced with the addition of N2 and CH4.1 Moreover, in the
presence of hydrates, the extent of CH4 dissolution into
water increases when using a mixture of CO2 and CH4 in the guest gas phase.16 With
the presence of more gaseous impurities in the liquid phase, their
interference with ongoing hydrate formation may increase, causing
overall hydrate formation to decelerate.

In our experiments,
smoother and more exponential hydrate growth was observed in the experiment
with N2 rather than CH4, as can be seen in Figure 6. This suggests that
the hydrate formation when taking N2 as a gaseous impurity
is faster than CH4 as the impurity. However, the overall
yield was observed to be higher in the case of CH4. This
might be due to the premature cessation of stirring due to the presence
of high volumes of hydrates in the system in the case of N2. Even though its overall yield was lower, the consumption of 250
mL of gas was reached in the N2 system within two hours,
whereas it took approximately 10 h for the CO2 + CH4 system to consume that amount of gas, indicating faster hydrate
formation in the CO2 + N2 system during the
stirring process. Due to the unavailability of a temperature probe
within the solution, and also the higher probability of localized
elevated temperature regimes, minor temperature fluctuations in the
quiescent systems were not captured. However, the temperature fluctuations
were accurately recorded in the stirred systems. Figures 7 and 8 show the effect of temperature fluctuations on hydrate formation
in the CO2 + CH4 and CO2 + N2 systems, respectively. These fluctuations were higher in
the periods of exponential hydrate growth, indicating the exothermic
behavior of the hydrate. In addition, plunges in hydrate growths were
observed to be proportional to the temperature rise, showing the sensitivity
of hydrate formation to temperature. This suggests that heat absorbers
are needed within the system to improve overall hydrate kinetics and
yields.18,19 Additional hydrate separation requirements
caused by these absorbers discourage them to be used in the system.
However, usage of better hydrate promoters combined with the continuous
removal of hydrates could help the system to improve its overall yield
without requiring heat absorbers. This needs cost analysis in between
the hydrate–absorber separation process compared against the
energy demand of continuous hydrate removal. Since the hydrates have
formed with defined boundaries and considerable strength, unlike the
hydrates of propane and CFCs, separation of these hydrates from brine
was easy.

3.6 Water Conversion into Hydrates
To further investigate hydrate yields, values of the total conversion
of water into hydrates were calculated for the s1 structure of CO2 hydrates. The results are listed in terms of percentage conversion.
As with the gas consumption results, the lowest water-to-hydrate conversion
was found in experiment 3 with a total conversion of approximately
7%. The highest conversion was found in experiment 1 at approximately
58%. Among the saline systems, the system with stirring and 100 ppm
of SDS (experiment 5) gave a total conversion of 35%. In the case
of CO2 + N2, the value was approximately 32%.
The water conversion results are shown in Table 5.

4 Conclusions
The
kinetics of CO2 hydrate formation has been studied under
various inhibiting and supporting conditions to quantitively check
its sensitivity toward these conditions. A total of five experiments
were conducted, the first experiment of which used the basic conditions
of having only water and pure CO2 gas in a quiescent system.
The impact of electrolytes and gaseous impurities on CO2 hydrate formation was studied in the next two experiments, whereas
a kinetic additive such as SDS and a physical intervention were introduced
in the final two.

Experimental observations of volumetric gaseous
consumption were used to measure the formation of hydrates by calculating
the level of gas conversion. It was found that hydrate formation was
greatly reduced by the introduction of salts. A further reduction
resulted from the addition of small amounts of methane to the gas
stream, making methane composition in the gaseous mixture up to 5
mol % of the resultant gaseous mixture.

Since CO2 hydrate formation did not occur at the gas–liquid interface,
there was no physical barrier toward the dissolution of gas during
hydrate formation. Considerable temperature fluctuations acted as
thermodynamic barriers in both quiescent and stirred systems. However,
stirring helped in dissipating heat throughout the reactor, which
resulted in higher overall hydrate yields as well as in smoother volumetric
gas consumption profiles.

Despite improving the eventual hydrate
yields, initial heterogeneous hydrate formation was observed to be
hindered in the stirred systems. This suggests that if an effective
heat removal technique is provided, quiescent systems could be more
productive than stirred systems in terms of both formation kinetics
and yields at lower operational costs. This observation suggests that
if an effective continuous removal of hydrate is provided without
disturbing the static liquid water interactions, the kinetics of hydrate
formation can be higher in unstirred systems, making the process economic
and efficient.
