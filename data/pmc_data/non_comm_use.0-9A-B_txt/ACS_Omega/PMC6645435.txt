Phosphoglucosamine
mutase (PNGM) is an evolutionarily conserved
bacterial enzyme in the peptidoglycan biosynthetic pathway, catalyzing
the reversible conversion between glucosamine 1- and 6-phosphate.
Previous structural studies of PNGM from the pathogen Bacillus anthracis revealed its dimeric assembly
and highlighted the rotational mobility of its C-terminal domain.
Recent studies of two other enzymes in the same superfamily have demonstrated
the long-range effects on the conformational flexibility associated
with phosphorylation of the conserved, active site phosphoserine involved
in phosphoryl transfer. Building on this work, we use a combination
of experimental and computational studies to show that the active,
phosphorylated version of B. anthracis PNGM has decreased flexibility relative to its inactive, dephosphorylated
state. Limited proteolysis reveals an enhanced and accelerated cleavage
of the dephosphorylated enzyme. 15N transverse relaxation-optimized
NMR spectra corroborate a conformational adjustment with broadening
and shifts of peaks relative to the phospho-enzyme. Electrostatic
calculations indicate that residues in the mobile, C-terminal domain
are linked to the phosphoserine by lines of attraction that are absent
in the dephosphorylated enzyme. Phosphorylation-dependent changes
in protein flexibility appear linked with the conformational change
and enzyme mechanism in PNGM, establishing this as a conserved theme
in multiple subgroups of the diverse α-d-phosphohexomutase
superfamily.

Introduction
Phosphoglucosamine
mutases (PNGMs) comprise a distinct subgroup
within the large enzyme superfamily known as the α-d-phosphohexomutases.1 These enzymes participate
in carbohydrate metabolism in organisms ranging from archaea to humans,
catalyzing the reversible conversion of 1- to 6-phosphosugars via
a bisphosphorylated sugar intermediate. PNGM is an essential enzyme
in Gram-negative bacteria1 due to its role
in converting glucosamine 6-phosphate to glucosamine 1-phosphate in
peptidoglycan biosynthesis.2 As such, it
is an established target for antimicrobial design.2,3 Enzymes
from other subgroups of the superfamily share a common catalytic mechanism,
but show varying preferences for the sugar moiety of their substrates,
including glucose (e.g., preferred by phosphoglucomutases), mannose,
and N-acetyl glucosamine.1

The multistep catalytic reaction of PNGM comprises two consecutive
phosphoryl transfer reactions: first, from a phosphoserine in the
active site to substrate, forming a bisphosphorylated sugar intermediate;
and second, from the intermediate back to enzyme, forming the product
and regenerating the active state of the enzyme (Figure 1A). The reaction requires an
unusual reorientation of the intermediate in the midst of the catalytic
cycle to enable the second phosphoryl transfer (see arrow in Figure 1A). In addition to
this conserved mechanism, structural studies of PNGM from Bacillus anthracis (BaPNGM) and Francisella
tularensis (FtPNGM) have shown that these enzymes
share the four-domain architecture common to all α-d-phosphohexomutases (Figure 1B), as well as the conformational mobility of their C-terminal
domains (Figure 1C).
Indeed, to date, proteins in the PNGM subgroup have been found to
exhibit the greatest conformational mobility in the superfamily, with
a rigid-body rotational variability of the C-terminal domain of up
to 50° in structural comparisons.4,5 Both PNGMs
of known structure also share a side-by-side dimeric arrangement,
which appears to be unique to this subgroup of the superfamily.6

1-phosphate
to glucosamine 6-phosphate catalyzed by BaPNGM. On left, the phosphoryl
group of Ser100 (yellow) is donated to the substrate to form the bisphosphorylated
intermediate (middle), which then reorients in the active site. On
right, the original phosphoryl group from the substrate (blue) is
transferred back to enzyme, creating the product and regenerating
the active form of the enzyme. (B) The crystal structure of the BaPNGM

beige. Ser100 is highlighted in green; the metal-binding loop is in
red. (C) A superposition of the two protomers from the dimer in (B),
showing the rotational variability of the C-terminal domain (pink

Recent studies of the related
enzyme, phosphomannomutase/phosphoglucomutase
(PMM/PGM) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, established a connection between enzyme mechanism and protein flexibility.
PMM/PGM is also a member of the α-d-phosphohexomutase
superfamily and shares 27% sequence identity with BaPNGM. In PMM/PGM,
the phosphorylation state of the conserved, catalytic phosphoserine
residue was shown to produce long-range effects on the flexibility
of the enzyme, as assessed by detailed biophysical studies including
hydrogen–deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry7 and HDX NMR.8 These
effects were also apparent in the solution using small-angle X-ray
scattering (SAXS) and from traditional biochemical methods such as
limited proteolysis.7,8 These results, which suggested
a connection between increased enzyme flexibility and the unusual
reorientation of the reaction intermediate (Figure 1A), prompted the question of whether proteins
from other subgroups of this important superfamily, including oligomeric
enzymes, would share this structural response to phosphorylation.

Here, we characterize the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated states
of BaPNGM with multiple, complementary methods. Unique features of
this enzyme relative to the previously studied PMM/PGM include its
differing substrate specificity, dimeric quaternary structure, and
the significantly greater rotational mobility of its C-terminal domain.4,5 We demonstrate that phosphorylation of the active site serine correlates
with a reduction in structural flexibility, as shown by the relative
decreases in its susceptibility to proteolysis, binding to 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic
acid (ANS), and rotational correlation time in solution. Electrostatic
calculations indicate an attraction between catalytic loops in the
phospho-enzyme and the C-terminal domain, suggesting a role for electrostatic
attraction in decreasing the structural mobility. Consistent with
the conserved mechanism of the enzyme superfamily, changes in the
structural flexibility of BaPNGM correspond to key states in its multistep
reaction, and may have implications for many proteins regulated by
post-translational modifications.

Results
Biochemical
Investigations of Protein Flexibility
The
recombinant BaPNGM purifies with Ser100 in its dephosphorylated state.9,10 Samples phosphorylated at Ser100 were prepared as in Experimental Procedures. Phosphorylation status was verified
by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (Figure S1) prior to use. Accessibility of phospho-
and dephospho-BaPNGM to proteolytic cleavage was assessed by a time
course of digestion with proteinase K, followed by visualization on
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
(Figure 2A). Relative
to the phospho-enzyme, dephospho-BaPNGM shows a significant increase
in susceptibility to proteolysis. This includes many more sites of
cleavage as well as much more rapid degradation (Figure 2A, right panel). After 240
min, no intact dephospho-enzyme remains.

(left) and dephospho-BaPNGM (right). Phospho/dephospho samples were

phospho (black) and dephospho-BaPNGM (blue).

The interaction of phospho- and dephospho-BaPNGM with the
fluorescent
dye ANS, a measure of accessibility of hydrophobic patches, was also
assessed (Figure 2B).
The dephospho-enzyme shows a modest but noticeable increase in fluorescence
emission, consistent with enhanced association with ANS. Increased
binding of ANS has been associated with increased structural fluctuations
of proteins, such as in molten globule states.11

NMR Spectra and Hydrodynamics
To
assess the potential
structural differences between phospho- and dephospho-BaPNGM in a
solution, 2H/15N-labeled samples were prepared
for NMR studies. An overlay of their transverse relaxation-optimized
spectra (TROSY) showing 1H–15N correlations in the backbone
is in Figure 3A. Overall,
both samples show a good peak dispersion in most regions, indicating
a well-ordered tertiary structure. Multiple differences between the
two samples, however, are also apparent. Dephosphorylation not only
shifts amide peaks but also causes a minor reduction in the number
of peaks (Figure 3A).
This decrease in the number of TROSY peaks of the dephospho-enzyme
is suggestive of line broadening by exchange between conformational
substates in msec, i.e., an increase in flexibility on a slow time
scale.

Figure 3 (A) Effects of phosphorylation on the NMR fingerprint, 15N TROSY spectra (phospho-PNGM: blue contours, dephospho-PNGM: red).
Conditions were 400 μM enzyme, 800 MHz 1H Larmor
precession frequency, 308 K, and pH 7.4. (B) 15N NMR transverse
cross-correlated relaxation. The relaxation rate constant ηxy4 was obtained by
exponential fitting to one-dimensional (1D) NMR spectra integrated
over 8.5–10 ppm. Conditions were 400 μM enzyme, 800 MHz,
308 K, and pH 7.4.

The overall hydrodynamic
behavior of the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated
forms of 2H/15N-labeled BaPNGM was compared
in terms of their 15N NMR transverse cross-correlated relaxation
rate constants, ηxy (Figure 3B). Phosphorylated BaPNGM has
ηxy of 62 ± 4 s–1; the relaxation of the dephospho-enzyme is similar with ηxy of 72.5 ± 13 s–1 at
308 K (Figure 3B).
These relaxation rates were interpreted using the TRACT approach,12 suggesting rotational correlation times (τc) at 308 K near 43 ± 3 ns for phospho-PNGM and 51 ±
9 ns for dephospho-PNGM. These time constants for the tumbling in
solution are consistent with a dimer of PNGM (expected molecular mass
of 102 kDa) and previous SAXS studies.4 The apparent τc of the dephospho- and phospho-enzymes
suggests that despite the differences in TROSY spectra, the effective
radius of gyration for each dimer is similar in the solution.

Comparison
of Electrostatics
Previous structural comparisons
have shown that the C-terminal domain of PNGM has significant rotational
mobility.4 The phosphorylation-dependent
differences in the solution behavior of BaPNGM raised the question
of whether phosphorylation modulates interactions with the mobile,
C-terminal domain. Precedent for this notion comes from the electrostatic
calculations of P. aeruginosa PMM/PGM
that indicated a long-range attraction between the positively charged
residues in its C-terminal domain and the negative charge in the vicinity
of the catalytic phosphoserine.8 A similar
arrangement for BaPNGM seemed possible, but could not be assumed due
to multiple differences between the proteins, including their low
overall sequence identities (27%). Moreover, the C-terminal domain
of BaPNGM is smaller (79 vs 93 residues in PMM/PGM), has a different
topology, and the rotational freedom of its C-terminal domain observed
in the crystal structure is much greater in BaPNGM than in PMM/PGM
(∼30 vs 10°).5

Models
for phospho- and dephospho-BaPNGM were prepared as described in Experimental Procedures. Partial charges were calculated
for the atoms around the divalent metal-binding site and Ser100, both
with and without phosphorylation. Electrostatic field lines for structures
of both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated BaPNGM were calculated
as described in Experimental Procedures. An
overview of the long-range (>10 Å) lines of attraction for
the
BaPNGM dimer are highlighted in Figure 4A, showing extensive interactions between the C-terminal
domain 4 (D4) and the rest of the protein. Overall, many of the interdomain
electrostatic interactions revealed by the field lines are similar
between the phospho- and dephospho-enzyme structures. However, within
the active site, striking differences are observed in the region spanning
the vicinity of the phosphoserine and D4. Here, converging field lines
(those colored in a gradient from red to blue) are obvious in phoshopho-enzyme
(Figure 4B), where
they connect a region of negative charge near the phosphoserine and
metal-binding loop to a positively charged patch in D4 that includes
two arginine residues (410 and 419). In contrast, in the dephospho-enzyme,
the number of attractive field lines between these two regions is
markedly diminished (Figure 4C).

of BaPNGM. (A) An overview of the BaPNGM dimer showing numerous, long-range
field lines between D4 and the rest of the protein. Chains A and B

(residues 240–244 shown as stick model). (C) A view of the
active site for dephospho-enzyme, similar in orientation to (B), showing

Relationships between Electrostatics,
Conformational Variability,
and Enzyme Mechanism
As noted above, the crystal structures
of BaPNGM and the related FtPNGM reveal a dramatic rotational mobility
of D4 as a rigid body, with variability seen between protomers within
a dimer and when comparing the two dimers.4 (Supporting file S1 shows an animation
of conformational change in D4 observed between the protomers of the
BaPNGM dimer.) To probe the potential impact of D4 mobility on the
electrostatic environment of the active site, residues connected by
the attractive field lines were examined in different conformers of
the enzyme, from B. anthracis or F. tularensis. For simplicity, we compare the inter-residue
distances between the Oγ of phosphoserine 100, and one of the
key arginines on the face of D4 (Arg419 in BaPNGM, Arg417 in FtPNGM)
(Figure 5A). These
inter-residue distances vary significantly by conformer, ranging from
9.4 to 19.9 Å. As electrostatic effects are well known to be
distance-dependent, the orientation of D4 likely has a significant
impact on the electrostatic environment of the active site, diminishing
the electrostatic attraction between this domain and the phosphoserine
as D4 is rotated away. Thus, phosphorylation state, D4 orientation,
and electrostatics appear to be intimately connected in these enzymes.

view of varying conformers of D4 in PNGM. (A) Inter-residues
distances shown on a superposition of the two protomers of BaPNGM
(chains A in blue; B in tan from PDB entry 3PDK) with chain A (green) of FtPNGM (PDB
entry 313W).
Distances indicated are between Og of Ser100 and the NH2 of Arg419
in BaPNGM, or the corresponding atoms in FtPNGM. (B) The same superposition
as in (A) with a model of bound ligand (glucose 1-phosphate in yellow)
based on the enzyme–ligand complex of P. aeruginosa PMM/PGM (PDB entry 1P5D); for more details see also ref (20). Note how the closed conformer of chain B (tan)
positions Arg419 for interaction with the phosphate group of ligand.

The orientation of D4 is also
relevant to enzyme mechanism, which
requires the protein to cycle between a “closed” state,
suitable for high-affinity interactions with bound substrate and phosphoryl
transfer, and an “open” state that would permit initial
interactions with substrate, release of product, and is also required
to enable the reorientation of the bisphosphorylated reaction intermediate
(Figure 1A). In particular,
the closed conformer of D4 positions Arg419 appropriately for interactions
with phosphate group of bound substrate (Figure 5B), a highly conserved role for this residue
in the enzyme superfamily.9 Given that
the phosphorylated state of the enzyme is its active form (Figure 1A), the observed
electrostatic environment would thus seem to favor the formation of
closed conformers relevant to catalysis. In the dephospho-enzyme,
the lack of electrostatic interactions between Ser100 and D4, along
with the concomitant increase in protein flexibility, would favor
the open enzyme conformers, which could facilitate the reorientation
of the intermediate required in the midst of the catalytic cycle (Figure 1A).

Discussion
Enzymes in the PNGM subgroup are perhaps best known for their roles
in bacterial pathogenesis.13−16 Overall, however, these proteins have not been well-characterized
biochemically or structurally, with only a few kinetic reports to
date13,16−20 and just two representative structures in the PDB,
one of which is published.9 As members
of the ubiquitous α-d-phosphohexomutase superfamily,
they are expected to share key mechanistic and structural features
that have been characterized well in other subgroups of the superfamily.1 Here, we pursued the intriguing connection between
phosphorylation and protein flexibility, first established in P. aeruginosa PMM/PGM.7,8 Recent biochemical
studies have revealed similar patterns in human phosphoglucomutase
1 (PGM1).21 As is the case for P. aeruginosa PMM/PGM, human PGM1 has distinct differences
relative to BaPNGM, including a longer sequence length (562 residues),
a monomeric state in a solution, and limited sequence identity (only
25%).

To determine whether BaPNGM undergoes analogous phosphorylation-dependent
changes in flexibility, several experimental approaches were utilized,
including several from previous studies of these related proteins.
In particular, limited proteolysis demonstrates a significant increase
in the structural flexibility of dephospho-BaPNGM, relative to its
phosphorylated state (Figure 2). These effects appear to be manifested across the structure
of the enzyme, as is apparent from the more rapid proteolytic digestion
and increased number of cleavage sites in the dephospho-enzyme. NMR
also suggests differences between phospho- and dephospho-BaPNGM in
a solution, based on changes in the 15N TROSY spectrum
(Figure 3). Cross-correlated 15N relaxation data might be consistent with a subtle slowing
of the rotational diffusion of dephospho-BaPNGM, but the differences
are within experimental error.

The molecular features of BaPNGM
responsible for its observed phosphorylation-dependent
behavior were also considered. In principle, these could include many
factors, such as changes in interdomain mobility, differences in the
time scales of conformational changes, increased “breathing
motions” reflecting some structural destabilization, or even
order-to-disorder transitions. Evidence for the former is suggested
by the electrostatic calculations of the active site of BaPNGM, which
show attraction between a negatively charged region that includes
the catalytic phosphoserine residue and positively charged residues
in D4. In contrast, in the dephosphorylated version of the active
site serine, this electrostatic attraction is absent, consistent with
increased relative mobility of D4, and potentially other regions of
the protein as well. The functional importance of D4 mobility is supported
by the crystallographic studies and normal mode analyses of BaPNGM,4 as well as the conservation of D4 motion across
the entire α-d-phosphohexomutase enzyme superfamily.6 This makes its potential modulation by phosphorylation
an attractive notion. The possibility of phosphorylation affecting
more localized protein dynamics would require a more detailed investigation.

We note that both phosphorylated (FtPNGM) and dephosphorylated
(BaPNGM) forms of these proteins crystallize, and show no obvious
structural differences related to phosphorylation (e.g., disordered
regions, etc.). Thus, phosphorylation or lack thereof does not appear
to produce structural differences observable by crystallography, despite
the differences observable in their solution behavior. Indeed, for P. aeruginosa PMM/PGM, where both dephospho- and
phospho-enzyme crystal structures are available at high resolution,
no significant structural differences can be discerned.7 This serves as an interesting, and perhaps cautionary,
example of how solution studies can add unexpected insights into proteins
of known structure.

As noted above, rotation of D4 in BaPNGM
is likely necessary at
several points in the multistep reaction, including binding of substrate,
release of product, and to permit rotation of the reaction intermediate.
This reorientation is a unique mechanistic feature of the enzyme superfamily,
which is intimately linked to the reversibility of the reaction and
the pivotal metabolic and biosynthetic roles of these enzymes. For P. aeruginosa PMM/PGM and rabbit PGM,22,23 this reorientation is known to occur “on enzyme” (i.e.,
without dissociation of the intermediate), which is an additional
mechanistic challenge for the enzyme. The observed coupling between
dephosphorylation and increased enzyme flexibility, which coincides
with the catalytic step requiring reorientation of the intermediate,
is a strong argument for the conservation of this mechanistic feature
across this ubiquitous enzyme superfamily.

Phosphorylation is
just 1 of more than 400 types of post-translational
modifications identified in proteins to date.24 The functional effects of post-translational modification are well
known and manifold. However, their structural effects are often assumed
to be localized, operating via changes in the immediate environment
of the phosphorylation site, or, on the other extreme, through induced,
large-scale structural rearrangements. Some recent studies, e.g.,24−26 however, are providing hints of nuanced yet significant structural
effects that remain largely unappreciated. This study adds to the
growing list of effects of post-translational modifications on protein
structure, with the unique addition of its mechanistic implications.

Experimental
Procedures
Protein Preparation
Expression and purification of
BaPNGM for the biochemical studies was done as previously described.27 For NMR studies, 2H/15N-labeled BaPNGM was expressed using the protocol in ref (28), with several minor modifications:
initial small-scale cultures were grown in 70% D2O and
then transferred into 99% D2O for final growth (250 mL).
Cultures were harvested when the bacterial growth reached a plateau
at an optical density at 600 nm of ∼6.0. Purification of the
labeled protein was done as referenced above for the unlabeled sample,
yielding 65 mg of pure, labeled protein from 500 mL of bacterial culture.
Purified proteins were dialyzed into 50 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propane
sulfonic acid (MOPS) pH 7.4 and 1 mM MgCl2, and concentrated
to ∼10 mg/mL. Samples were either used immediately or flash
frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at 193 K.

Phosphorylation
and Assessment by Mass Spectrometry
The phosphorylation of
the active site phosphoserine (Ser100) of
BaPNGM was assessed before and after treatment with glucose 1,6-bisphosphate
using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Protein
at a concentration of 430 μM was incubated with a 10-fold molar
excess of glucose 1,6-bisphosphate for 16 h at 4 °C. Excess glucose
1,6-bisphosphate was removed by extensive dialysis against 50 mM MOPS,
pH 7.4, and 1 mM MgCl2.

For mass spectrometric studies,
10 μL protein samples at 1 pmol/μL in 1% formic acid were
analyzed by NanoLC-Nanospray QTOF (Agilent 6520) in positive ion mode
with a Zorbax C8 trap column. Data were examined using the Qual software
provided with the instrument. The mass error between samples is 0.11
Da (2.1 ppm), and the quantification error is 2%. Percent phosphorylation
was calculated by normalizing the sum of the dephosphorylated and
phosphorylated peak heights to 1.0. In all of the samples, no more
than one phosphorylated residue was observed.

Assays of Accessibility
Limited proteolysis of BaPNGM
in its phospho and dephospho states was done as follows. Protein samples
at 1.5 mg/mL were incubated with Tritirachium album proteinase K (Fisher Scientific) in 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.4 at a 500:1
(w/w) ratio. Digestion was conducted at room temperature, aliquots
removed at various time points, and the reaction terminated by the
addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentration: 3
mM). The reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 14% polyacrylamide
gels.

ANS-binding of phospho- and dephospho-enzyme samples was
assessed as follows. ANS at 0.5 mM was incubated with protein samples
at 12 μM in 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.4, 1 mM MgCl2 for 1
h at 25 °C. Data were collected using a BioTek Synergy Mx Microplate
reader. The excitation wavelength was 365 nm, and the emission spectra
were recorded from 400 to 560 nm. Fluorescence intensities of samples
were corrected for ANS emission spectra in buffer.

TROSY Spectra
and Rotational Correlation Times by NMR
2H/15N-labeled PNGM was concentrated to approximately
360 μM in 50 mM MOPS (pH 7.4), 1 mM MgCl2, and 7%
D2O. Two-dimensional 15N band-selective excitation
short-transient traverse relaxation-optimized NMR spectroscopy29 and 1D cross-correlation relaxation spectra30 were collected at 35 °C on a Bruker Avance
III 800 MHz spectrometer with TCI cryoprobe. The NMR spectra were
processed using NMRpipe31 and viewed using
SPARKY.32 Transverse cross-correlated 15N NMR relaxation rate constants ηxy30 (relaxation involving dipole–dipole
interactions with chemical-shift anisotropy) were measured for phosphorylated
and dephosphorylated BaPNGM. Series of 1D versions of the spectra
were collected to measure the average ηxy values for the amide spectral regions corresponding to
the rigidly structured (not random coil) regions of PNGM using the
relaxation periods of 0, 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, and 20 ms, each in triplicate.
The TREND software package33 was used to
integrate backbone amide proton signals from 8.5 to 10 ppm. These
integrals were fitted to a single exponential decay to extract the
relaxation rate constant ηxy.30 The rotational correlation time τc was estimated using eqs 3–6 in ref (12) which assume isotropic
rotational diffusion. However, crystallographic coordinates of the
PNGM dimer suggest some axial symmetry.

Electrostatic Field Calculations
PDB entry 3PDK, which is dephosphorylated,
was the starting point for the electrostatic calculations of the BaPNGM
active site. The phosphorylated version of Ser100 in BaPNGM was modeled
based on a superposition with the related P. aeruginosa PMM/PGM (PDB entry 1K35), which is phosphorylated on the corresponding serine. In addition,
because the low pH of the crystallization buffer precluded the binding
of divalent cations in the active site of BaPNGM (PDB entry 3PDK), the metal-binding
loop (residues 240–244) for both phospho- and dephospho-enzyme
was also modeled as in PDB entry 1K35,8 which has
an identical amino acid sequence in the loop. Atomic charges and sizes
around the metal-binding site of BaPNGM were parameterized using the
Amber tools module MCPB/MTKPP, which invokes Gaussian 2009.34,35 Other atomic sizes and charges were defined by the Amber ff99SB
force field.35 The electrostatic potentials
were then computed using the adaptive Poisson–Boltzmann solver36 at 310 K, with protein and solvent dielectric
constants of 2.0 and 78.5, respectively, and ionic strength of 30
mM. Electrostatic field lines were visualized using visual molecular
dynamics37 as previously described.38,39
