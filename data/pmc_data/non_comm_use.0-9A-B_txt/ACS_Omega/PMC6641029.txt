Moving
to nanoscale is a path to get perfect materials with superior
properties. Yet defects, such as stacking faults (SFs), are still
forming during the synthesis of nanomaterials and, according to common
notion, degrade the properties. Here, we demonstrate the possibility
of engineering defects to, surprisingly, achieve mechanical properties
beyond those of the corresponding perfect structures. We show that
introducing SFs with high density increases the Young’s Modulus
and the critical stress under compressive loading of the nanowires
above those of a perfect structure. The physics can be explained by
the increase in intrinsic strain due to the presence of SFs and overlapping
of the corresponding strain fields. We have used the molecular dynamics
technique and considered ZnO as our model material due to its technological
importance for a wide range of electromechanical applications. The
results are consistent with recent experiments and propose a novel
approach for the fabrication of stronger materials.

1 Introduction
Nanomaterials
have a number of high-energy partially coordinated
surface atoms that are comparable to the volume of their low-energy
fully coordinated atoms. This forms the root of their size-dependent
properties, such as enhancement of mechanical and piezoelectric properties
by reducing the size.1−4 This size dependence provides an additional controlling parameter
for tailoring the characteristics of nanostructures. Defect engineering
on the nanoscale is another fascinating possibility for building materials
with various properties. Defects such as stacking fault (SF), twinning,
vacancies, and interstitials are generally formed during the nanostructure
fabrication process, which can modify the mechanical,5−7 electrical,8 and optical properties.9,10 Among different types of nanostructures, one-dimensional nanostructures,
for example, nanowires (NWs), nanotubes (NTs), and nanobelts (NBs),
have been attracting significant attention from the research community
due to their wide range of applications, such as composite reinforcement,11,12 energy harvesting,13,14 sensors,15,16 light-emitting diodes,17,18 and hybrid energy storage
systems.19,20 Therefore, tailoring and improving their
properties, specifically, the mechanical properties, is key for their
effective utilization.

The common understanding is that (points
and planar) defects weaken
the mechanical properties of nanostructures.7,21−26 However, recent experiments on GaAs NWs depicted that introducing
a high density of SFs increases the compressive critical stress and
Young’s Modulus.5,6 In this case, interestingly, the
Young’s Modulus of defected NWs is even greater than that of
the perfect wurtzite (WZ) structure. It is worth mentioning that despite
the experimental evidence previous molecular dynamics simulations
could not capture this phenomenon.5

Here, we explore the material design space using the two aforementioned
additional design parameters, that is, defect concentration and size,
and demonstrate tailoring the material properties by engineering their
coupled effect. We have considered the ZnO NWs as the model material
and have shown that planar defects can strengthen NWs beyond that of the ones
with perfect structure. Our results indicate that the Young’s
Modulus of NWs, surprisingly, increases as the density of the SFs
increases in the NWs. Also, although the critical stress increases
by introducing more SFs for the compressive loading, it has an inverse
effect on the critical stress for tensile loading. This unique behavior
is explained by the localized longitudinal (c axis)
stress and strain at defect sites. The interplay between SFs and free
surfaces is the other cause of this effect. At the bulk, SFs are typically
embedded between partial dislocations,27 whereas at the nanoscale, they are confined between free surfaces.
In the latter case, the SF creates a step at the surface, changing
the local crystal structure, which may alter the overall electromechanical
properties of the NWs.

2 Numerical Model: Development
and Validation
SFs, one of the most common types of planar
defects in II–VI
and III–VI semiconductor nanostructures,28−30 are categorized
into two types: (i) basal-plane and (ii) prismatic-plane SFs. Here,
we have developed a numerical model for the mechanics of I1-SF in WZ ZnO, which has the lowest formation energy, 15 meV/unit-cell
area,31 among the different basal-plane
SFs (I1, I2, E) of WZ. The I1-SF
Burger vector () in ZnO is (1/3) [011̅ 0] + (1/2)
[0001],28 which is generated by removing
a layer of c-plane atoms and moving the rest by . The perfect WZ structure has a stacking
sequence of ...AaBbAaBbAaBbAaBbAa..., where the uppercase and lowercase
letters refer to Zn and O atoms in two consecutive layers, respectively,
whereas I1-SF changes the stacking sequence to ...AaBbAaBbCcBbCcBbCc...
(Figure 1a,b). Periodic
boundary conditions are applied along the c axis,
to mimic a long NW, and lateral directions are considered to be free.
A Buckingham-type interatomic potential is utilized with Binks’
fitted parameters for ZnO32 (Table S1 in Supporting Information), which correctly
captures its mechanical and surface properties and has been successfully
used to study ZnO nanostructures. Also, the developed atomistic model
is verified as it reproduces the reported experimental and numerical
electromechanical properties of perfect ZnO NWs.3,4,33−37

Figure 1 (a) Perfect WZ stacking sequence along the [0001] direction,
where
the uppercase and lowercase letters refer to O and Zn atoms in the
same layer, respectively. (b) The stacking sequence for I1-SF, where the arrows show the SF locations. (c) Longitudinal stress
distribution along the c axis for a perfect NW (dotted
line) and a NW with a single defect (solid line). (d) Structure of
a WZ NW with 13 SFs within 40 nm length.

Numerical simulations of the defected structure are performed
by
initially relaxing the NW for 100 ps at the simulation temperature, T = 0.01 K, under microcanonical ensemble (NVE). Then, the
isothermal–isobaric ensemble (NPT) with a Nosé–Hoover
thermostat is applied for another 100 ps to find the final relaxed
configuration. In the last stage, a constant strain rate of ±0.001
fs–1 is applied along the c axis
to model the mechanical response of the NW under tension/compression.
Similar simulations are performed for a strain rate of ±0.0001
fs–1 to ensure that the results are independent
of strain rate. The Young’s Modulus is estimated by fitting
a linear expression on the early section of the stress–strain
curve, ϵ < 0.01; this stands for the initial stage of loading.
The numerical model is implemented in the large-scale atomic/molecular
massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS) code,38 and a time step of 1 fs is chosen for all simulation steps.

One of the classical problems in atomistic simulations of defects
is the long-range interaction between the defects in a simulation
cell and their corresponding periodic images. To overcome this issue
and model a single SF, NWs of different lengths are modeled and each
relaxed longitudinal stress field was compared to that of the similar
perfect NW. Our simulations indicate that the long-range interactions between
a SF and its image in a periodic cell are negligible for NWs of length
40 nm and longer (Figure 1c). Here, to avoid ambiguities in calculating the stress using
atomistic simulations due to unclear definition of the structure volume
at such scales, we have used a representative stress, σ* (= σz V/atom),
to illustrate the effect of SF on stress distribution within the structure.
High peaks appear at the defect, which rapidly decay toward the periodic
boundaries (Figure 1c); that is, at the periodic boundaries, the stresses of the perfect
and defective NWs is almost the same. Thus, a length of 40 nm is chosen
for all simulated NWs here, whereas their diameters vary from 3 to
10 nm to study the effect of size. Furthermore, the effect of defect
density on mechanical behavior is investigated by introducing numerous
SFs, up to 13, in 40 nm length of a perfect NW. Therefore, the distance
between two adjacent SFs varies from 20 to 3 nm for different defect
densities. Figure 1d shows the schematic of a defected NW with 13 SFs in 40 nm length
of the NW, which results in a distance of 3 nm between two adjacent
SFs.

3 Results and Discussion
By applying
periodic boundary conditions in all directions, we
have calculated the Young’s Modulus of bulk ZnO to be 146 GPa,
which is in close agreement with the reported experimental value,
≈140 GPa,39−41 and verifies the developed model. Also, the formation
energy of I1-SF is calculated using the Binks potential
to ensure its capability for predicting the properties of the faulted
structure. The calculated I1-SF energy is 14.1 meV/unit-cell
area, which is in good agreement with density functional theory calculations,
15 meV/unit-cell area31 (see Supporting Information for detailed calculations).
The interaction between the defects and size scale on the structural
properties of NWs is studied by introducing a single I1-SF in the middle
of 40 nm long ZnO NWs of various diameters and measuring their tension/compression
response.

3.1 Mechanical Response and Size Dependence
The stress gradually increases to reach a maximum, called critical
stress, where phase transformation occurs to release the accumulated
elastic energy that results in the stress drop (see Figure S2). At the critical stress, the original WZ structure
transforms into a graphite-like (HX) phase under compression and a
body-centered tetragonal phase under tension.4,34,36 However, in the presence of a SF, the NW
breaks at the SF under tensile loading without any phase transition
because the defect acts as an active site for crack initiation and
the NW cannot store enough elastic energy to initiate the phase transition
(Figure S2). In contrast, under compression,
we still observed the WZ → HX phase transition.

Variations
of the Young’s Modulus and critical stress versus diameter
for perfect and defective (with a single I1-SF) NWs are
plotted in Figure 2a. Although the variation of Young’s Modulus in the presence
of a single SF is negligible (Figure 2a), the critical stress generally reduces by introducing
a SF (Figure 2b), and
this effect is more pronounced for NWs with a diameter smaller than
4 nm. The difference in the strength (critical stresses) of defective
and perfect NWs decreases by increasing their diameters.

of ZnO NWs. (a) Young’s Modulus of perfect and defective (single
SF) NWs under compression/tension vs diameter, which show negligible
effect of SF. (b) Variation of critical stress σc as a function of diameter under compression/tension, which indicates
larger reduction of σc for thinner NWs as SF is introduced
into their structure. The superscripts Ten and Comp stand for tensile
and compression test, respectively.

The overall size dependence of Young’s Modulus at
a nanoscale
was frequently reported, using both experimental2,35 and
theoretical approaches,4,33,42,43 and was associated with the surface stress
contribution. One well-known explanation is based on the core–shell
model,44 where a shell (outer layers) is
under compressive stress due to surface stresses and the core (inner
layers) is under tension. The compressive stress at the shell causes
surface stiffening and increases the overall Young’s Modulus
of the NWs with smaller diameters. The gap between critical stresses
of defective and perfect NWs can be explained by the intrinsic strain
distribution along the longitudinal direction, [0001], of the relaxed
structure. The longitudinal strain, ϵz, is calculated using OVITO45−47 and is shown in Figure 3. The SF induces
intrinsic tensile strain at defect sites and compressive strain at
the defect surrounding, which causes reduction in the critical stress.
The size dependence of the difference between the critical stresses
of defective and perfect NWs can be justified by the interplay between
the surface and SF energies. Generally, reducing the system size leads
to an increase in the total energy density because of the increase
in the surface energy. Therefore, introducing SFs into a NW of smaller
diameter requires more energy per atom in comparison to that for a
larger-diameter NW, which is the source for the size dependence of
the critical stress difference between perfect and defective NWs.
This has also been verified experimentally for III–V NWs,48 for which the SF density depletes with decreasing
diameter and a perfect WZ NW can be produced by reducing its diameter.

Figure 3 Longitudinal
strain, ϵz, for
NWs with different defect densities and a diameter of 10 nm. Results
for (a) 1 SF, (b) 3 SFs, (c) 6 SFs, and (d) 13 SFs are presented,
which indicate complexity and interference of strain field as the
number of SFs increases.

3.2 Defect Density
The possibility of
tailoring the mechanical properties of nanostructures through defect
engineering was investigated by introducing multiple SFs with a constant
separation distance into a ZnO NW of 10 nm diameter. The spacing between
SFs ranges from 3 to 20 nm for different defect densities, that is,
number of SFs in unit length (ρSF). Variations of
the Young’s Modulus and critical stress as a function of the
number of defects within 40 nm length (i.e., defect density, ρSF) are plotted in Figure 4 for both tensile and compressive loadings. Our results
show that increasing the ρSF gradually increases
the Young’s Modulus in tension and compression. However, no
drastic changes in the critical stress were captured in tension and
only a slight increase was observed for compressive loading. Our simulations
show that introducing a high density of SFs, SF = 13, into a perfect
structure leads to a 6.23% increase in critical stress (the critical
stresses are summarized in Table S2). Surprisingly,
the Young’s Modulus of a highly defective NW (13 SFs in a 40
nm long NW) is even higher than that of the perfect NWs, a result
that is nontrivial. This finding opens up a novel approach for synthesizing
nanostructures with a higher Young’s Modulus through defect
engineering. The stress–strain curves are depicted in Figure S3 for more reference. It is worth mentioning
that this behavior was observed experimentally for GaAs NWs under
buckling; however, they could not capture this physics using atomistic
simulations.5,6 The effect of strain rate on the
mechanical properties of NWs is a well-known phenomenon.49 Therefore, all simulations were repeated by
lowering the strain rate by 1 order of magnitude, 0.0001 fs–1, to investigate the impact of this parameter on the ascending trend
of Young’s Modulus. Our results (Figure 4) show that despite the lower strain rate
Young’s Modulus still increases by increasing the number of
SFs.

Figure 4 Effect of SF density on the mechanical response of NWs. (a) Variation
of tensile/compressive Young’s Modulus vs density of SFs, indicating
that a higher Young’s Modulus can be obtained by introducing
higher defect densities in the NW. (b) Effect of SF density on the
critical stress, revealing degradation of this material property for
the tensile loading, whereas it shows slight improvement under compressive
loading and small defect densities. All simulated NWs have the same
diameter of 10 nm. The properties of a perfect NW are shown with dotted
lines.

The underlying physics is multifaceted,
which may lie in changes
of the bond nature around defects, as proposed in refs (5) and (6). The effect of SF on the
atomistic structure of WZ NW is shown in Figure 5, which reveals the formation of a step at
the defect site after relaxation. At the intersection of SF and free
surface, surface stresses cause a severe local deformation. At the
intersection of SF and the [011̅ 0] surface, the bond length
of Zn–O, located at the inner layer, represented by b1, decreases from 1.978 Å in a perfect
crystal to 1.884 Å in the deformed structure. The out-of-plane
Zn–O bond length, denoted b2, is
2.141 Å, whereas the out-of-plane bond length in the perfect
structure is 2.005 Å. Also, the in-plane bond angle, θ1, is 123.112° in the highly deformed zone, whereas this
value decreases to 120.303° for a perfect WZ. Finally, the out-of-plane
angle, θ2, is 91.871° for the defective (single
I1-SF) and 111.458° for a perfect structure. These
variations in the bond length/angle can be used to verify the change
in mechanical properties of the nanostructure, that is, E ∝ d–4, where d and E are the bond length and Young’s Modulus,
respectively.50 Introducing more SFs results
in a larger change in the bond length and angle, which consequently
alters the mechanical response of the system. Another explanation
for this phenomenon can be given by considering the strain
distribution in the relaxed structure. The intrinsic longitudinal
strain in the presence of multiple SFs is depicted in Figure 3b–d for different defect
densities and indicates that the tensile strain is induced at SF sites,
whereas compressive strain appears at the upper and lower regions
of the SFs. As the density of SFs increases, the tensile strain slightly
decreases from 0.0116 to 0.0101, whereas the compressive strain increases
from −0.0078 to −0.011. This change in the longitudinal
strain is due to the overlap between the strain fields of adjacent
SFs. Referring to the core–shell model, increasing the compressive
strain at the shell leads to a reduction in bond length and a higher
Young’s Modulus for the NWs.

a ZnO NW. (a) Perfect WZ
crystal structure in the absence of SF on the [011̅0] surface.
(b) The crystal structure at the intersection of SF and the [011̅0]
surface.

To explore the effect of SF density
on the critical stress, the
similar reasoning can be used. The sharp stress drop in the stress–strain
curve of ZnO NWs (Figures S2 and S3) can
be explained by the phase transition in ZnO NWs. During loading, the
NW stores energy in the form of elastic energy until a critical value
is reached. At this point, the stored energy will be released by the
phase transition mechanism. In compression, a new HX phase nucleates
from the surface and at some distance from the SF (see Figure S2). This can be described by the formation
of highly localized deformed regions around SFs, which change the
bond type and crystal structure (Figure 5). These domains are not the ideal sites
for nucleation; hence, the nucleation site will be shifted away from
the SF locations. Increasing the number of SFs increases the number
of these deformed zones and consequently limits the possibility of
HX phase nucleation. This leads to an increase in the energy required
for activating the phase transition mechanism and subsequently an
increase in the compressive critical stress.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we have investigated the possibility of applying defect
engineering to tailor the mechanical response of nanostructures, using
an atomistic modeling approach with ZnO NWs as our model material.
The simulations revealed that introducing a higher density of I1-SFs will increase the Young’s Modulus beyond that
of the corresponding perfect structure under both tensile and compressive
loadings. Also, a highly defective NW exhibits a higher strength under
compression test, whereas SFs reduce the tensile strength. The reason
behind this higher Young’s Modulus can be the change in the
bond length and overlapping of the SF strain fields. To study the
changes in the bond types and lengths, a detailed study using ab initio
techniques is required. Additionally, the interaction between the
surface energy and the SF intrinsic stress predicts that adding the
SFs in smaller NWs can have a drastic impact on the mechanical properties
of a material. The results presented here suggest new routes for fabrication
of NWs with superior mechanical properties.

Considering the
fact that intrinsic strain can mediate the properties
of nanostructures, additional detailed studies are required to explore
the effect of SFs on the electrical, optical, and electromechanical
response of NWs.51,52 Also, there is a feasibility
to increase the NW activity by introducing SFs as active sites for
chemical reactions; thus, chemical activity of a material can be tailored
by introducing a proper distribution of SFs. Furthermore, studying
the effects of other types of SFs, I2 and E, point defects,
and twin boundary on material response would be another promising
avenue for exploration.53,54 Finally, the possibility
of strengthening a nanostructure via synthesizing the WZ/zinc blende
(ZB) polytype structures can be examined, that is, the SFs are observed
at the WZ/ZB interface.
