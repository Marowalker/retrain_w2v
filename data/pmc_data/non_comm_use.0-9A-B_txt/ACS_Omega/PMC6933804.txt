Thermodynamic equilibrium analysis is necessary to provide
a fundamental
understanding of the distribution of the products formed in the Fischer–Tropsch
process. The thermodynamic equilibrium distribution of the products
formed at constant temperature and pressure was studied based on the
minimization of the total Gibbs free energy of the system. The effects
of temperature, pressure, and feed ratio on the product distribution
were investigated under typical operating conditions. The distribution
of the total products obtained from the reactions of added ethylene
or ethanol was also studied. The results indicated that the products
formed in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium follow Anderson–Schulz–Flory’s
general polymerization distribution at carbon numbers greater than
about three. Both olefins and paraffins are primary products and there
are essentially no alcohol and water at high degrees of conversion
when the conditions for thermodynamic equilibrium are satisfied. The
olefins formed in the Fischer–Tropsch process consist essentially
of propylene. The product distribution is very sensitive to feed composition,
and to temperature and pressure to a lesser extent. The product spectrum
can be described broadly by the probability of chain growth relative
to chain termination. This parameter decreases with increasing temperature,
the feed ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide, and after the addition
of ethanol to the feed, but increases with increasing pressure and
after the addition of ethylene to the feed. An increase in reaction
temperature results in a shift in selectivity towards low carbon number
hydrocarbons and more hydrogenated products.

1 Introduction
As the major component
of natural gas, methane has attracted increasing
attention in recent years. The primary chemical reactions of methane
are steam reforming to synthesis gas, oxidation, and halogenation.1,2 The quest for an efficient process to convert methane efficiently
to high value-added chemicals is motivated by the ever-increasing
demands placed on them as well as recently discovered rich reserves
of methane. Direct conversion into high value-added chemicals can
be realized either nonoxidatively via methane dehydroaromatization3,4 or oxidatively via oxidative coupling of methane.5,6 Alternatively,
methane can be catalytically converted to C2 and higher
hydrocarbons via an indirect route, and this process is usually carried
out in two steps. Methane is converted into synthesis gas containing
carbon monoxide and hydrogen in a steam reforming process or in a
partial oxidation process,7,8 followed by final conversion
to higher hydrocarbons. Synthesis gas can also be produced from other
sources, such as coal, biomass, and virtually any hydrocarbon feedstock,
by reaction with steam, oxygen, or carbon dioxide.9,10 The
production of hydrocarbons from synthesis gas is usually referred
to as the Fischer–Tropsch process.11,12 Catalysts used in this process are typically comprised of a catalytically
active metal from one of Group VIIIB elements.13,14 In particular, iron,15,16 cobalt,17,18 nickel,19,20 and ruthenium21,22 have been
extensively used as the catalytically active materials for the Fischer–Tropsch
process. Cobalt and ruthenium are particularly effective for the catalytic
conversion of synthesis gas to primary hydrocarbons having five or
more carbon atoms.23,24

The main products formed
in the Fischer–Tropsch process
range from methane to higher alkanes and aliphatic alcohols.25,26 The process is critical to the production of liquid fuels and chemicals
from carbonaceous feedstock.27,28 Despite the research
that has been done to date, the need exists for further improvement
in commercial Fischer–Tropsch processes.29,30 For example, a great deal of effort has been made to develop more
efficient Fischer–Tropsch reaction systems and catalyst systems,
which will eventually lead to an increase in the selectivity for high-value
hydrocarbon products from the Fischer–Tropsch processes.31,32 In particular, iron, cobalt, and ruthenium based catalysts have
been developed for use in various reactor types,33,34 and much progress has been made in preparation technology.35,36

There is a significant difference in the distribution of the
hydrocarbon
products formed from different Fischer–Tropsch reaction systems.37,38 The selectivity to the desired product depends upon the conditions
under which the Fischer–Tropsch process is performed.39,40 Accordingly, it is highly desirable to improve the selectivity to
the desired high-value liquid fuels and chemicals, such as primarily
hydrocarbons having five or more carbon atoms. These hydrocarbons,
which correspond to gasoline or diesel products, are expected to be
in great demand. Traditional methods produce a range of hydrocarbon
products,41,42 which can be characterized by the Anderson–Schulz–Flory
distribution, irrespective of catalyst type.43,44

Recent studies suggested that thermodynamic equilibrium analysis
is necessary to provide a fundamental understanding of the distribution
of the products formed in the Fischer–Tropsch process, and
the importance of such a product distribution should not be underestimated.45,46 This thermodynamic method offers greater flexibility for complex
problems for which the pathways of the Fischer–Tropsch reactions
are unclear. Furthermore, this thermodynamic equilibrium distribution
may have important implications for the improvement in the selectivity
of the desired products. However, further studies are needed to determine
the distribution of the Fischer–Tropsch products formed in
a state of thermodynamic equilibrium.

In this study, the thermodynamic
equilibrium distribution of the
products formed in the Fischer–Tropsch process was investigated
at constant temperature and pressure. The effects of different operating
conditions on product distribution were evaluated using a thermodynamic
equilibrium calculation on the basis of the minimization of the Gibbs
free energy. The distribution of the total products obtained from
the reactions of added ethylene or ethanol was also studied. The objective
of this study was to determine the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution
of the products formed in the Fischer–Tropsch process under
different operating conditions. Particular emphasis was placed on
determining how the carbon number product distribution depends on
various operating conditions.

2 Results and Discussion
The primary
compounds involved in the products may be primary olefins
in the C2–C15 range,47,48 normal paraffins in the C1–C15 range,
normal alcohols in the C1–C8 range, water,
and carbon dioxide.49,50 In all of the cases studied herein,
complete conversion of carbon monoxide and hydrogen is assumed, and
all the products are in the vapor phase. The effects of different
operating conditions on product distribution are investigated under
typical operating conditions using the equilibrium modeling method
described later.

2.1 Effects of Temperature and Pressure
The effect of changing temperature on the distribution of Fischer–Tropsch
products is studied. The results obtained for different temperatures
are presented in Figure 1, wherein the distribution of the product is expressed as a function
of the number of carbon atoms. The temperatures of the product mixture
considered here are 510, 525, and 540 K, respectively, the pressure
is 1.5 MPa, and the usage ratio is 0.7. The usage ratio typically
varies between 0.5 and 1.0 for iron-based catalysts and has been found
to be about 0.7, obtained from the majority of the results available.51,52 The logarithm of the mole fraction of the total organic products
is plotted against the number of carbon atoms.

Figure 1 Distribution of the total
products at different temperatures. The
logarithm of the mole fraction of the total organic products is plotted
against the carbon number. The temperatures of the product mixture
are 510, 525, and 540 K, respectively, the pressure is 1.5 MPa, and
the usage ratio is 0.7.

At each temperature of the thermodynamic equilibrium
system, there
is a linear relationship between the number of carbon atoms and the
concentration of the C4 plus products. An increase in reaction
temperature results in a shift in selectivity towards low carbon number
hydrocarbons, as depicted in Figure 1. This shift in selectivity is consistent with the
relative stability of the products. Therefore, low carbon number hydrocarbons
are thermodynamically favored at high temperatures. Chain growth probability
is somewhat sensitive to the reaction temperature. More specifically,
this parameter decreases from 0.72 to 0.68 when the temperature of
the thermodynamic equilibrium system increases from 510 to 540 K.
Chain growth probability decreases with increasing temperature, which
is in consistence with the experimental results available in the literature.47,48 In addition, the ratio of the amount of C3 product to
that of C2 product increases with increasing temperature,
which is also in consistence with the experimental results available
in the literature.47,48 This ratio indicates the extent
of the reincorporation of C2 product.47,48

The Fischer–Tropsch reactions are assumed to be carried
out under different pressure conditions, and the effect of changing
pressure on the distribution of Fischer–Tropsch products is
investigated. The results obtained for different pressures are presented
in Figure 2, wherein
the distribution of the product is expressed as a function of the
number of carbon atoms. The temperature of the product mixture is
540 K, and the usage ratio is 0.7. The pressures used in the Fischer–Tropsch
process are 0.38, 0.75, and 1.5 MPa, respectively, and thus pressure
variations are significant. The results indicate that high carbon
number hydrocarbons are thermodynamically favored at high pressures.
Chain growth probability is somewhat sensitive to pressure. More specifically,
this parameter varies from 0.56 at a pressure of 0.38 MPa to 0.68
at a pressure of 1.5 MPa.

Figure 2 Distribution of the total products at different
pressures. The
temperature of the product mixture is 540 K, the usage ratio is 0.7,
and the pressures are 0.38, 0.75, and 1.5 MPa, respectively.

Irrespective of the temperatures and pressures
considered herein,
the products formed in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium follow
Anderson–Schulz–Flory’s general polymerization
distribution at carbon numbers greater than about three, as predicted
in Figures 1 and 2. The Fischer–Tropsch synthesis may be viewed
as a simple polymerization reaction, and the monomer is carbon monoxide
or a C1 species derived from it. Schulz53,54 derived an equation for the distribution of molecular weights of
polymers obtained by a free radical polymerization process, i.e.,
through a one-by-one addition of monomer to a growing chain. If there
is a constant probability of chain growth, the Schulz distribution
function is generally applicable. Flory55 and Anderson56 continued efforts to account
for the products formed by chain branching, to derive theoretical
distribution functions for various types of macromolecular formation,
and to develop chain growth mechanisms. The polymerization process
can be described by the Anderson–Schulz–Flory distribution
if the chain growth probability is assumed to be independent of the
chain length.

2.2 Effect of Feed Ratio
The usage ratio
defined in eq 1 is equal
to the feed ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide, as a complete conversion
of hydrogen and carbon monoxide is assumed in the Fischer–Tropsch
process. The results obtained for different feed ratios are presented
in Figure 3, wherein
the distribution of the product is expressed as a function of the
number of carbon atoms at a specified temperature and pressure. The
temperature of the product mixture is 540 K, the pressure is 1.5 MPa,
and the feed ratios of hydrogen to carbon monoxide considered here
are 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8, respectively.

Figure 3 Distribution of the total products at
different feed ratios of
hydrogen to carbon monoxide. The temperature of the product mixture
is 540 K, the pressure is 1.5 MPa, and the feed ratios are 0.6, 0.7,
and 0.8, respectively.

There is difference in the distribution of the
products formed
under different feed ratio conditions, as depicted in Figure 3. For each feed ratio of hydrogen
to carbon monoxide, there is a linear relationship between the number
of carbon atoms and the concentration of the C4 plus products.
Corresponding to each feed ratio, chain growth probability is determined
based on the C4 plus products. Chain growth probability
is very sensitive to feed ratio. This parameter decreases from 0.76
at a usage ratio of 0.6–0.58 at a usage ratio of 0.8. Chain
growth probability is 0.68 at a usage ratio of 0.7, which is the average
reported in the literature.51,52 When the whole system
is at thermodynamic equilibrium at the specified temperature and pressure,
the selectivity to methane is between 0.4 and 0.6 in the Fischer–Tropsch
product stream.

The selectivity to methane depends on the conditions
under which
the Fischer–Tropsch process is performed, for example, the
feed ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide, as depicted in Figure 3. An increase in
the feed ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide results in a shift in
selectivity toward low carbon number hydrocarbons, especially towards
methane. In all of the cases studied herein, complete conversion of
carbon monoxide and hydrogen is assumed, as described above. Under
the specified conditions, the selectivity to methane is relatively
low due to low feed ratios of hydrogen to carbon monoxide used in
this study. This has important implications for the improvement in
the selectivity of the desired products. Higher feed ratios of hydrogen
to carbon monoxide tend to favor the formation of methane, i.e., methanation,
as depicted in Figure 3. This is particularly undesirable. For practical applications, however,
a variety of feed ratios can be used for the Fischer–Tropsch
process.11,12 The optimum feed ratio of hydrogen to carbon
monoxide is about 1.8–2.1 for cobalt-based catalysts.13,14 Iron-based catalysts can tolerate lower feed ratios due to intrinsic
water–gas shift reaction activity of iron-based catalysts.57,58 Nickel-based catalysts can also be used, but tend to favor the formation
of methane,59,60 especially under high-feed ratio
conditions.

2.3 Formation of Alcohols and Water
The
amount of alcohols formed in the Fischer–Tropsch process is
predicted by Newton’s method. Interestingly, the products resulting
from the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis contain essentially no alcohols
at high degrees of conversion, when the conditions for thermodynamic
equilibrium are satisfied for the reaction system. Therefore, alcohols
are not favored as products under the specified conditions, and the
product distribution depicted in Figure 3 is entirely that of normal paraffins and
primary olefins. This offers an explanation for the results available
in the literature,47,48 in which the amount of alcohol
formed in the Fischer–Tropsch process has been found to decrease
with decreasing space velocity. It is worth noting that low space
velocities enable the distribution of the products to approach chemical
equilibrium.

When the conditions for thermodynamic equilibrium
are satisfied, the amount of water predicted by Newton’s method
is essentially zero at high degrees of conversion. It has been found
that only a small amount of water formed over an iron-based catalyst,47,48 as it is apparently limited by the water–gas shift reaction.
This reaction favors the formation of hydrogen and carbon dioxide
rather than that of carbon monoxide and water vapor at the temperatures
considered here, given the fact that the conversion of reactants to
products becomes less favorable with increasing reaction temperature61,62 due to the exothermic nature of the Fischer–Tropsch reactions.

2.4 Formation of Olefins
The amount of
olefins formed in the Fischer–Tropsch process will vary depending
on the way in which the process is carried out.47,48 To better understand the distribution of the products, the effect
of the reaction temperature is investigated on the basis of the minimization
of the Gibbs free energy. The predicted mole fractions of olefins
at each carbon number as a function of the number of carbon atoms
at different temperatures are depicted in Figure 4. The temperatures of the product mixture
considered here are 525 and 540 K, respectively, the pressure is 1.5
MPa, and the usage ratio is 0.7.

Figure 4 Olefin mole fractions obtained at each
carbon number at different
temperatures. The temperatures of the product mixture are 525 and
540 K, respectively, the pressure is 1.5 MPa, and the usage ratio
is 0.7.

The results indicate that Fischer–Tropsch
products contain
a certain amount of olefins, in all of the cases studied herein, with
the amount dependent to some extent on the conditions used. The low
carbon number hydrocarbons formed in the Fischer–Tropsch process
are fairly olefinic. The products contain varying amounts of olefins
depending on the temperature employed. An increase in reaction temperature
results in a shift in selectivity towards more hydrogenated products,
as depicted in Figure 4. This shift is consistent with the relative stability of the products.
The amount of olefins present in the products is quite different from
each other. The concentration of C2 olefinic products is
low, the concentration of C3 olefinic product is high,
and the concentration of high-molecular-weight olefinic products in
the C4–C10 range is essentially constant.
Therefore, the olefins formed in the Fischer–Tropsch process
are predominantly primary olefins, consisting essentially of propylene,
under the specified conditions. On the other hand, the amounts of
olefins decrease with decreasing temperature. Therefore, higher temperature
operation favors an olefinic product.

2.5 Effect of Ethylene or Ethanol to the Feed
There exists evidence that some species such as olefins and alcohols
may become incorporated into growing chains,63,64 but the extent to which this occurs seems to vary greatly with reaction
conditions.65,66 The distribution of the total
products formed in the Fischer–Tropsch reactions of added ethylene
or ethanol is studied using the equilibrium modeling method described
later.

When the reaction system is in a state of thermodynamic
equilibrium, the effect of the addition of ethylene to the feed on
the distribution of the total products is depicted in Figure 5. The temperature of the product
mixture is 540 K, the pressure is 1.5 MPa, and the usage ratio is
0.7. High carbon number hydrocarbons become more thermodynamically
favorable after the addition of ethylene to the feed, and the presence
of ethylene suppresses the conversion of carbon monoxide to methane
through hydrogenation. Both of them are in consistence with the experimental
data available in the literature.67,68 In addition,
the presence of ethylene effects the chain growth probability. More
specifically, this parameter varies from 0.68 in the absence of ethylene
to 0.8 with a molar ratio of ethylene to carbon monoxide 0.2:1. Therefore,
chain growth probability is very sensitive to the addition of ethylene
to the feed. The addition of ethylene to the feed of carbon monoxide
and hydrogen enhances the formation of propylene. Overall, ethylene
acts as an effective chain initiator, as the presence of ethylene
enhances the formation of high carbon number hydrocarbons.

Figure 5 Distribution
of the total products after the addition of ethylene
to the feed. The temperature of the product mixture is 540 K, the
pressure is 1.5 MPa, and the usage ratio is 0.7.

On the other hand, the effect of the addition of
ethanol to the
feed on the distribution of the total products is depicted in Figure 6. Low carbon number
hydrocarbons become more thermodynamically favorable after the addition
of ethanol to the feed, and the presence of ethanol enhances the conversion
of carbon monoxide to methane through hydrogenation. In addition,
the presence of ethanol also affects the chain growth probability.
More specifically, this parameter varies from 0.68 in the absence
of ethanol to 0.56 with a molar ratio of ethanol to carbon monoxide
0.2:1. Therefore, chain growth probability is also very sensitive
to the addition of ethanol to the feed. After the addition of a small
amount of ethanol to the feed of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, however,
the formation of alcohols with greater than two carbons is enhanced
in the Fischer–Tropsch process. This is because ethanol also
acts as a chain-growth initiator.69,70 Overall, the
distribution of the total products is greatly affected by the addition
of ethylene or ethanol to the feed.

the addition of ethanol
to the feed. The temperature of the product mixture is 540 K, the
pressure is 1.5 MPa, and the usage ratio is 0.7.

3 Conclusions
The thermodynamic equilibrium
distribution of the products formed
in the Fischer–Tropsch process was studied based on the minimization
of the Gibbs free energy. The following major conclusions can be drawn
from this study.The products formed in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium
follow Anderson–Schulz–Flory’s general polymerization
distribution at carbon numbers greater than about three.

Both olefins and paraffins are primary products. The
olefins formed in the Fischer–Tropsch process are predominantly
primary olefins, consisting essentially of propylene.

Product distribution and chain-growth probability are
very sensitive to feed composition, and to reaction temperature and
pressure to a lesser extent. An increase in the reaction temperature
results in a shift in selectivity towards low carbon number hydrocarbons
and more hydrogenated products.

The presence
of ethylene or ethanol greatly affects
the chain growth probability and both of them function as chain initiators.

Chain growth probability decreases with
increasing temperature
and the feed ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide but increases with
increasing pressure. This parameter decreases after the addition of
ethanol to the feed, but increases after the addition of ethylene
to the feed.

Alcohols and water are thermodynamically
unfavored at
high degrees of conversion when the conditions for thermodynamic equilibrium
are satisfied.



It is worth noting that a general distribution has been
determined
for the total products formed in the Fischer–Tropsch process,
which is completely independent of the reaction mechanism and catalyst
used. This general distribution is important to identify the difference
in performance between different catalysts, and trends in product
selectivity, through the comparison with the product distributions
determined by experiment.

4 Development of the Model
The chemical
mechanism of the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis
is still being debated. This synthesis process involves a series of
chemical reactions, and the overall chemical reaction can be expressed
as 1  in which U is the overall
usage ratio of the Fischer–Tropsch reactions, and ai, bi, ci, d, and e are the undetermined stoichiometric
coefficients of the products formed in the Fischer–Tropsch
process. The products are assumed to be normal paraffins, primary
olefins, normal alcohols, water, and carbon dioxide, as defined in
the above equation. Paraffins constitute a specific type of reaction
product of the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis included within the
hydrocarbons. Paraffins generally do not react further under conditions
applicable to the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis.71,72

Thermodynamic equilibrium analysis is of significant importance
to determine the product distribution, as it can provide significant
insight into the compositions and properties of complex mixtures,73,74 on the basis of the minimization of the Gibbs free energy.75,76 Therefore, thermodynamic equilibrium analysis is performed to determine
the distribution of the products formed in the Fischer–Tropsch
process under different operating conditions. The flexibility of the
equilibrium modeling method used in this study is due to the ease
with which the distribution of the products formed in the complex
reaction system can be determined without needing to specify each
chemical reaction equation, as noted above. When the conditions for
all mechanical, chemical, and thermal equilibrium are satisfied, the
reaction system is in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium.77,78 Therefore, the intensive properties of the product mixture are homogeneous.
Global thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed in this study, and thus
intensive properties such as temperature, pressure, concentration,
and density are homogeneous throughout the whole thermodynamic system.

The important criterion for chemical equilibrium is that the Gibbs
free energy is minimized for the overall chemical reaction proceeded
at constant temperature and pressure. Therefore, the Fischer–Tropsch
reactions are assumed to be carried out at constant temperature and
pressure. It is possible to determine the distribution of the products
formed in the Fischer–Tropsch process, based on the thermodynamic
equilibrium at which the Gibbs free energy for the overall chemical
reaction is minimized. To determine this distribution, it is required
to minimize the total Gibbs free energy of the product mixture at
thermodynamic equilibrium: 2  in which G is the total Gibbs
free energy of the product mixture at thermodynamic equilibrium under
the particular conditions, Ni is the number of moles of each species, and Gi is the Gibbs free energy of species i in the product mixture.

The mass balance constraints
are given for a single-phase reaction
by 3  in which Mk is the number of moles of element k fed to
the thermodynamic reaction system, nk,i is the number of atoms of element k in species i, and Ni is the moles of species i leaving the system.

To minimize the total Gibbs free energy
of the product mixture,
Newton’s method is employed with the NASA computer program
Chemical Equilibrium with Applications (CEA) developed by Gordon and
McBride.79,80 Thermodynamic data are included with this
program for reaction products and reactants. The thermodynamic data
provided with the CEA program are in the form of least-squares coefficients.
These data, in formatted form, are processed by subroutine UTHERM
and stored for further use in the unformatted form. Thermodynamic
data are expressed as temperature-dependent values. The amount of
data for the thermodynamic properties of chemical species involved
in the Fischer–Tropsch process is very large. Thermodynamic
data are readily available through the CEA program and therefore are
not provided herein. To obtain the Gibbs free energy of species i in the product mix as defined in eq 2, the ideal gas thermodynamic properties are
corrected by using the Soave–Redlich–Kwong equation
of state.81,82

The distribution of the products can
be represented by 4  in which Mn is the mole fraction of all the products having n carbon atoms, n is the number of carbon atoms in
the chain, and α is the probability of chain
growth relative to chain termination. Chain growth probability is
defined as 5  in which rp and rt are the rates of propagation and termination,
respectively.

The mole fractions of the products formed in the
Fischer–Tropsch
process are usually plotted on a semilogarithmic scale,83,84 as chain growth probability can be determined from the slope of
such a plot in the following form 6  The logarithmic form of the above equation
is a convenient way to characterize the distribution of the total
products because a plot of log Mn is linear with the number of carbon atoms.

Mathematical models are of significant importance in the natural
sciences such as chemistry.85 Validation
of the model is carried out by comparing the numerical results with
the experimental data available in the literature.86 Validation of a mathematical model means that the model
within its domain of applicability possesses a satisfactory range
of accuracy consistent with the intended application of the model.87,88

The experimental conditions are given as follows: the temperature
of the product mixture is 536 K, the pressure is 1.48 MPa, and the
feed ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide is 0.7. Computational simulations
are carried out with the model using the same set of conditions to
check the accuracy of the model by comparison with the experimental
data. The comparison results are presented in Figure 7, wherein the distribution of the total products
formed in the Fischer–Tropsch process, on the basis of methane-free
products, is expressed as a function of the number of carbon atoms.
The results obtained from the model are in good agreement with the
experimental data.

in
the Fischer–Tropsch process, on the basis of methane-free products,
at each carbon number with the experimental data available in the
literature.86 The temperature of the product
mixture is 536 K, the pressure is 1.48 MPa, and the feed ratio of
hydrogen to carbon monoxide is 0.7.
