The
aim of this work was to demonstrate an optimization methodology
to reliably obtain stable macrodispersions (i.e., for ≥24 h)
of carbon nanotubes in water using sonication. Response surface methodology
(RSM) was utilized to assess and optimize the sonication parameters
for the process. The studied input parameters were (i) sonication
time (duration), (ii) amplitude (of vibration), and (iii) pulse-on/off
(duration) of the sonicator. The analyzed responses were mean diameter
and size distribution of multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT) aggregates
in water, which were measured by the dynamic light scattering technique.
A semiempirical model was developed and statistically tested to estimate
the magnitude of sonicator parameters required to obtain specified
MWNT macrodispersions (i.e., aggregates’ mean diameter and
distribution) in water. The results showed that MWNT aggregates of
2 ± 0.5 μm can be obtained by optimizing sonicator parameters
to a sonication time of 89 s, amplitude of 144 μm, and pulse-on/off
cycle of 44/30 s. These process settings for 100 mg/L MWNTs in a 30
mL aliquot of deionized water would consume 863 J/mL of sonication
energy. Contrary to the popular belief, “sonication time”
and/or “sonication energy input” were not found to be
proportional to the degree of dispersion of MWNTs in water. This might
be the reason for the frequent disparity and nonreproducibility of
sonication results reported in scientific literature, especially for
dispersing nanomaterials in a number of different systems. The amplitude
of vibration was noted to be the most sensitive parameter affecting
MWNT aggregates’ diameter and distribution in water. The characterization
of MWNTs was performed using electron microscopy, surface area analyzer,
thermogravimetric analyzer, and zeta potential analyzer. This study
can be helpful in evaluating sonication dispersion of particulate
matter in other incompressible fluids such as graphene dispersion
in organic solvents.

1 Introduction
Carbon
nanotubes form suspensions in water but their dispersion
state changes over time making it difficult to quantify their degree
of dispersion.1 To address this problem,
NIST and NASA defined the terms “macrodispersion” and
“nanodispersion” for carbon nanotube suspensions.2 Macrodispersion represents dispersed aggregates
of carbon nanotubes, while nanodispersion refers to ones consisting
of individual carbon nanotubes.3 Both types
of dispersions have their own significance and applications; however,
this work is focused on macrodispersions of carbon nanotubes.

Carbon nanotubes are known to remarkably improve the electrical,
mechanical, and photocatalytic properties of composites.4−6 These exceptional benefits of carbon nanotubes can be harnessed
only if they are reasonably dispersed (in the medium) during the synthesis
of composites.6−9 However, strong interaction forces between carbon nanotubes cause
their agglomeration into aggregates, thereby limiting their dispersion
in most solvents.6,10 On average, 500–950 eV
binding energy per micrometer of carbon nanotube length holds them
together in an aggregate.11−15 To disperse them, an appropriate amount of external energy is required
to overcome this high amount of binding energy. Continual efforts
have been underway to obtain stable dispersions of carbon nanotubes
since their discovery. The methods used to disperse carbon nanotubes
can be broadly categorized into either chemical or mechanical methods.
For chemical methods, researchers have approached the problem by mostly
varying (i) solvents,16 (ii) solvent compositions,14,17 and (iii) solvent additives such as surfactants and macromolecules.6,9,10,12,18,19 Mechanical
methods such as shear mixing, ball milling, and melt blending are
sometimes used;20 however, ultrasonication
(aka sonication) remains the most popular mechanical method to disperse
carbon nanotubes.6,9,12,21,22

Unless
otherwise required, water is a natural choice for solvent
owing to its universal availability, low cost, inherent nontoxicity,
and ease of handling and because it facilitates high solubility for
a variety of solutes. Carbon nanotubes tend to aggregate in water
owing to nonspecific hydrophobic forces against the solvent and substantial
van der Waals attractions between the CNTs.1 The magnitude of the van der Waal’s attractions was calculated
to be up to 950 eV/μm (carbon nanotube length) by Girifalco
et al.15 A molecular dynamics study performed
by Walther and Jaffe23 calculated a 28.66
kJ/mole increase in free energy when carbon nanotubes are moved from
air to water. This positive change in free energy, thought to be contributed
by the carbon–carbon and water–water (cost of cavity)
interactions, makes the dispersion of carbon nanotubes in water thermodynamically
unfavorable.23 This hinders the ability
of water to disperse carbon nanotubes without the provision of an
external energy source. This external energy source can be mechanical
tools like rotor–stator mixers, colloid mills, ball mills,
shear mixers, and sonicators.

Sonication is the most extensively
used mechanical dispersion technique,
primarily due to its simplicity of application.6,9,12,21,22 It reduces the size of carbon nanotube aggregates,
shortens their length, opens their ends, and creates functional groups
at their sidewalls and on their terminal ends.6,7 This
alteration in the morphology and functionality of carbon nanotubes
increases their hydrophilicity and enables them to better disperse
in water. However, a great risk of damage to carbon nanotube integrity
is also associated with improper sonication because of the occurrence
of complex physical and chemical phenomena during the process.24−26 If not accounted for properly, these phenomena can lead to adverse
alterations to the characteristics of carbon nanotubes in dispersion.8 Unfortunately, little attention is paid to the
simple process of sonication, resulting in the frequent occurrence
of either “under-sonication” or “over-sonication”
of carbon nanotube dispersions. Inadequate dispersion and inadvertent
breakage of carbon nanotubes during sonication are some such examples.10

In this study, a process is reported for
optimizing sonication
parameters to obtain multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT) dispersions
of required aggregate size (mean diameter and standard deviation).
MWNTs were dispersed in water with the aid of a probe sonicator under
different sonicator operational settings (parameters/variables/factors)
of sonication time, vibration amplitude, and pulse (on/off) mode to
observe their effects on mean diameter and distribution (i.e., standard
deviation) of MWNT aggregates. Using response surface methodology
(RSM), a model was developed, analyzed, and validated to predict the
dispersion of MWNTs for different sonicator parameters. Finally, a
desired range of sonicator parameters was identified for the set criteria
of minimizing size and variability (in the sizes) of carbon nanotubes
aggregates at minimal sonication energy cost.

2 Materials
and Methods
2.1 Materials
MWNTs with average diameter
and length of 10 and 1500 nm, respectively, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA). The MWNTs were over 95% pure and had been prepared
by the catalytic carbon vapor deposition method. Sodium hydroxide
(98.8%) was provided by Poch Basic (Gliwice, Poland). Reagent-grade
hydrochloric acid, dibasic potassium phosphate, and sodium chloride
were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich. Vacuum filtration was carried out
using GF/F glass microfiber filter disks (Millipore Corp., Billerica,
MA, USA). Fresh deionized water, with an average resistivity of 18.2
MΩ·cm, was used in all experiments.

2.2 Cleaning
Procedure for MWNTs
The
as-received MWNTs were treated with hydrochloric acid, using previously
established protocol27 summarized in Figure S1. Briefly, 1 g of MWNTs was added to
500 mL of Pyrex glass container followed by the addition of 200 mL
of 10 M hydrochloric acid. The suspension was stirred for 6 h using
a magnetic stirrer. Three hundred milliliters of deionized water were
added, and the suspension was filtered through binder-free glass microfiber
filter, Whatman GF/F (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, UK), using a vacuum
filtration apparatus. At least seven washes of the MWNT cake, hence
obtained, were performed (using deionized water) to remove residual
hydrochloric acid. Finally, the MWNT cake was dried to constant mass
in the oven at 70 °C to remove moisture and vaporize away the
hydrochloric acid, if any. The cake was ground to powder using a glass
rod in the prewashed borosilicate beaker and stored in an air tight
container until further use.

2.3 Characterization of MWNTs
and MWNT Dispersions
The structure of MWNTs was examined
by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) using an FEI Quanta FEG 250 SEM from FEI Co. (Hillsboro, OR,
USA). The equipment was operated at ∼20 keV. Prior to imaging,
the sample surface was coated with <50 nm layer of gold and palladium
using a GATAN model 682 precision etching coating system. Thermal
analysis of MWNTs was carried out using a PerkinElmer Thermogravimetric
Analyzer (Waltham, MA, USA) using nitrogen as a carrier gas. The temperature
was gradually increased from 30 to 800 °C using approximately
10 mg of sample. The difference in weight over the temperature gradient
provided the information about the sample. The charge on MWNTs was
measured, using a ZetaPALS analyzer (Brookhaven, NY, USA), through
electrophoretic mobilities of MWNTs at variable pH of the background
solution.

Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) surface area and
porosity of MWNTs was measured by NOVA 2200e automated gas sorption
system (Quantachrome, FL., USA) using nitrogen gas at 77 K. The data
were analyzed by Quantachrome NOVAWIN data acquisition and reduction
software version 11.02 provided by the manufacturer. The adsorption/desorption
isotherms of N2 were measured at a relative pressure (P/Po), ranging from 0.0001 to
0.99. The BET equation was utilized to determine the specific surface
area.

2.4 MWNT Dispersions in Water
MWNT dispersions
were prepared by adding 3 mg MWNTs to 30 mL of deionized water (to
obtain 100 mg/L concentration). The sonications were performed at
different settings of the pre-calibrated probe sonicator (Q125) that
had a 3 mm diameter probe (Qsonica LLC, Newton, CT, USA). The resulting
suspensions were allowed to stabilize for a period of 24 h. After
24 h, the sample was drawn for dispersion analysis from the middle
of the 30 mL cylindrical vial using 0.5 mL pipette.

MWNTs are
rod-like particles with a high aspect ratio. Therefore, ideally, they
should be described as such in aqueous systems. However, it is difficult
to find an analytical expression to describe rod-like particles following
Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek theory.28 Therefore, MWNT aggregates were approximated
to spherical particles and their effective diameter was calculated
using Stokes–Einstein relationship.1,3,19,28 MWNT aggregate
size and particle distribution was determined using ZetaPALS analyzer
(Brookhaven, NY, USA), which was also used for zeta potential measurements.
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique was used to measure aggregate
size and distribution of MWNTs after sonication. The data were analyzed
using Particle Solutions software from the manufacturer. The effective
diameter of MWNTs was calculated using the Stokes–Einstein
relationship as shown in eq 1 1  where dh is the
hydrodynamic diameter (m) of an equivalent sphere of MWNT aggregates, kB is the Boltzmann constant (1.3807 × 10–23 J K–1), T is
the absolute temperature (K), and η is the dynamic viscosity
of water (0.009 kg m–1 s–1) under
the experimental conditions. The standard deviation of MWNT aggregates,
representing the distribution of MWNTs, was calculated using MS Excel
software. To obtain the standard deviation, at least 10 runs of five
cycles each were performed on each sample.

2.5 Experimental
Design
RSM was applied
to identify the effect of various sonicator parameters on MWNT dispersion.
RSM is a collection of statistical and mathematical techniques helpful
for developing, improving, and optimizing processes.29,30 The use of RSM in dispersing MWNTs reduces the process variability
and requires fewer resources. Central composite design (CCD), a form
of RSM, was used with four variables at five levels. To understand
the relationship between the sonicator’s operating parameters
and the dispersion of MWNTs in water, four independent variables (sonication
time, the amplitude of vibration, pulse-on duration, and pulse-off
duration) were selected. The effects of these variables on two responses,
namely, MWNT aggregate size and aggregate distribution, were examined.
The details of actual variables and their corresponding dimensionless
factors, at studied levels, can be found in Table 1. Alpha (α) is the coded level of the
axial point and “1” is for a factorial point from the
center “0”. The coding was performed to normalize the
effects of factors on responses, and the coded levels were obtained
by subtracting the actual values of the variables from their value
at the central point and dividing by the step chance value. Full factorial
design requires 54 = 625 experiments, however (as shown
in Table 2), RSM reduced
the required experiments to 30 only: 8 at axial, 16 at factorial,
and 6 at center points of deign. Table 2 provides the detailed description of actual experimental
conditions recommended by RSM and their position in the design space.
It should be noted that (in Table 2) the values of sonicator’s input variable [A:
time (s)] and its corresponding total sonication energy (J) are based
on unit volume (1 mL) of dispersions. In practice, 30 mL aliquots
were processed. Therefore, the sonication time [A: time (s)] (and
water volume) should be multiplied by the factor of 30 to mimic actual
experimental conditions of this study.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Characterization
Figure 1a presents
the SEM images of
MWNTs revealing their morphology, structure, and intertubular cohesion.
The outer diameter of MWNTs was approximately 10 nm, which was comparable
to the reported value from the manufacturer. No obvious amorphous
carbon particles and other impurities were spotted at all magnifications,
possibly a result of the acid treatment performed to dissolve away
impurities.27

Figure 1 Characterization of MWNTs
used in this study: (a) scanning electron
micrograph, (b) TGA, (c) zeta potential, (d) adsorption/desorption
of nitrogen gas, and (e) pore size distribution.

Thermal stability and purity of materials can be evaluated
by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA). In TGA, the oxidation temperature represents the thermal
stability of a material and can be identified as a peak in the derivative
of the weight loss as a function of temperature.31 The decomposition profile of MWNTs is exhibited in a weight
loss curve as represented in Figure 1b. The mass loss of materials can be divided into four
distinct regions: (i) 0–100 °C represents the loss of
moisture; (ii) 100–300 °C represents the decomposition
of carboxylate, anhydride, and lactone functional groups; (iii) 300–500
°C is indicative of more stable phenol and carbonyl functionalizations;
and finally, (iv) >500 °C exhibits the decomposition of amorphous
carbon.32 Therefore, it can be seen that
the MWNTs carry adsorbed water (0.6% mass loss until 100 °C),
contain some functionalities (3.5% mass loss until 500 °C), and
oxidize at 600 °C. The 3.5% mass loss (until 500 °C) cannot
be wholly attributed to functional groups, because some might be due
to amorphous carbon. Lehman et al.33 reported
the oxidation temperature of single-walled carbon nanotubes at 350
°C. MWNTs, in this study, were prepared by catalytic vapor deposition,
where metal catalyst acts as a precursor for the growth of carbon
nanotubes. In this process, the probability of single-walled carbon
nanotube formation cannot be completely ignored. In the case of our
material, however, there was only a 0.5% loss in mass from 350 to
500 °C, indicating very few single-walled carbon nanotubes, if
any.

Figure 1c displays
the change in zeta potential of MWNTs with the change in surrounding
aqueous pH. Zeta potential measurements are indicative of ionically
stabilized colloid systems, that is, the stability of colloidal system
increases with the increase of zeta potential of suspended particles
above ±25 mV.34 Zeta potential can
also be explained in terms of two layers of liquid surrounding the
particle: (i) the stern layer and (ii) the diffuse layer. The stern
layer exists as an inner layer where the ions are strongly bound to
the particle, whereas the diffuse layer is the outer layer where ions
are less firmly bound to the particles. The potential at this outer
boundary is measured through electrophoretic mobility using the Smoluchowski
equation to estimate zeta potential.22 The
point of zero charge of MWNTs was calculated, by interpolating the
measured zeta potential values at pH 3, 4.5, 6, 7.5, 9, and 10.5,
to be at pH 6.6.

Adsorption, dispersion, catalytic activity,
functionalization,
and toxicity are some of the characteristics that are directly dependent
upon the surface architecture of a material. Many uncommon properties
of MWNTs are attributed to their unique three-dimensional surface
structure.33,35 Therefore, understanding the
surface area helps in elucidating MWNT interaction with other materials.
In an individual MWNT, the spaces between concentric cylinders of
graphene are 0.34 nm36 which are too narrow
to accommodate nitrogen gas molecule whose kinetic diameter is approximately
0.36 nm.37 However, MWNTs tend to aggregate,
in water and air, at ordinary conditions. The typical MWNT aggregate
carries four distinct sites for nitrogen adsorption: (i) external
surface area; (ii) groove area; (iii) interstitial area; and (iv)
inner pores.35,38,39 The overall magnitude of these multiple nitrogen adsorption sites
depends upon a number of factors such as synthesis procedure, purification
methods, and chemical and physical modifications.40 These factors can be held responsible for large differences
(up to 75×) in reported specific surface areas of MWNTs from
22.4 to 1670 m2/g.41,42 The curves of the nitrogen
adsorption/desorption isotherms of MWNTs (Figure 1d) are convex and comparable to the reversible
type III isotherm under IUPAC classification, which exhibit weak attractive
adsorbate–adsorbent interactions.43 The type III isotherm is characterized by heats of adsorption less
than the adsorbate heat of liquefaction, whereby adsorption proceeds
with the adsorbate’s interaction with an adsorbed layer (i.e.,
adsorbate–adsorbate interaction) that is greater than that
of the adsorbent’s surface (adsorbate–adsorbent interaction).43−46 This kind of isotherm is reported for nitrogen adsorption on the
basal plane of graphite.45 Therefore, from
the structure of MWNT aggregate, it can be assumed that most of the
nitrogen adsorption took place on the external surface area of MWNTs.
The desorption of nitrogen was employed to calculate BET surface area
at low-pressure ranges.46,47 The recommended range
of P/Po from 0.35 to
0.05 was utilized to calculate BET surface area.47 MWNTs, in this study, carried a specific surface area of
440.7 m2/g.

Pore size distribution was investigated
using density functional
theory (DFT). Classical macroscopic theories such as the BJH method,
DR approach, and SF semiempirical treatment all fail to provide a
realistic description of the filling of micropores and narrow mesopores,
leading to an underestimation of pore sizes. To achieve a reasonable
description of pore size distribution, DFT was applied to understand
the sorption and phase behavior of fluids in narrow pores at a molecular
level.48Figure 1e shows the pore size distribution of MWNTs.
It can be seen that the majority of the pores in MWNTs are mesopores
having a diameter between 6 and 20 nm.

3.2 MWNTs
Dispersion in Water
Macrodispersions
of MWNTs were prepared using sonication energy. Table 2 describes the details of experimental runs
(from column 1 to 9): (i) number of experiments, (ii) position of
each experiment in the CCD space, (ii) time duration of sonication,
(iv) amplitude of vibration, (v) duration of pulse-on, (vi) duration
of pulse-off, (vii) resulting sonication energy from time, amplitude,
and pulse-on/off, (viii) average diameter of MWNT aggregates, and
(ix) size distribution of MWNT aggregates in dispersion. The values
of input variables A–D were suggested by RSM and outputs were
calculated by (i) calibrating the sonicator (sonication energy)22,49 and (ii) analyzing the MWNT dispersions by DLS (the responses average
aggregate size and distribution). Figure 2a presents the photographic images of MWNTs,
sonicated at the different conditions specified in Table 2. These images can be visually
evaluated in comparison to the factors and responses (Table 2). Therefore, before proceeding
further, the data were tested for their smoothness (precision) by
correlating distribution of MWNT aggregates with their mean sizes
at different sonication energies. Figure 2b, hence obtained, gives a reasonable correlation
(R2 = 0.84) between the diameter and standard
deviation of MWNT aggregates. Also, the high sonication energy dispersions
(red dots, see key within Figure 2b) cluster in the region where MWNTs diameter is small
and distribution is narrow. This improves confidence in the validity
of the dataset. From Figure 2a,b, one can pick up the visually desirable dispersion state
of MWNTs and estimate its aggregate size corresponding to the required
sonication energy. A general conclusion drawn from Figure 2a,b was that the average aggregate
size of ∼2–6 ± 0.5 μm can be achieved by
sonicating MWNTs in water at energies below 1 kJ per mL water, provided
that the working volume is 30 mL and concentration of MWNTs is 100
mg/L. Figure 2b (along
with Figure S2 in the Supporting Information) can be helpful for a rough estimation of MWNT macrodispersions.
The average diameter and standard deviation (distribution around mean
diameter) were measured to estimate the aggregation state of MWNTs
in water. The diameter and distribution data of MWNT aggregates in Figures 2b and S2 can be plotted against input variables (variables
A–D in Table 2) to find their mutual relationship, if any. Therefore, the effect
of each factor on MWNT dispersion was studied by plotting the MWNT
aggregates’ mean diameter and size distribution against sonication
time, amplitude, pulse-on duration, and pulse-off duration (Figures S3–S6). The objective, there,
was to find out whether any correlation exists between the sonicator’s
operating parameters and dispersion of MWNTs in water. Figure S3 shows the absolute absence of correlation
between time of sonication and MWNT aggregates’ diameter as
well as its distribution. This raises a serious concern for researchers
reporting carbon nanotubes dispersion in water in terms of sonication
time. Similarly, amplitude also failed to explain MWNT dispersion
(Figure S4), as did the pulse-on (Figure S5) and pulse-off (Figure S6) durations. Pulse-off duration was studied owing
to its indirect effect on dispersion by impacting the temperature
of the system being sonicated. This effect will become more prominent
in subsequent sections (Pareto analysis). Because the individual sonicator’s
parameters could not explain the macrodispersion of MWNTs, their combined
effect was plotted. Figure S7 shows the
plot of sonication energy versus dispersion of MWNTs. The increase
in the quantity of sonication energy was expected to enhance the dispersion
of MWNTs; however, no significant correlation between sonication energy
and MWNTs dispersion in water was observed. Therefore, contrary to
the popular belief, it was hypothesized that “the sonication
energy is not proportional to the quality of MWNTs aqueous dispersions”.50

3.3 Model Fitting and Analysis
Because
the individual sonicator operational parameters failed to describe
the dispersion of MWNTs in water, experimental results were utilized
to develop semiempirical expressions capable of expressing MWNT dispersions
in water. Equations 2 and 3 represent the relationship between sonicator’s
parameters and mean diameter of MWNT aggregates in coded and actual
terms of studied factors, respectively. Similarly, eqs 4 and 5 were
developed for MWNT aggregates’ size distribution in water,
in terms of standard deviation from the mean aggregate diameter. The
coded equations (eqs 2 and 4) are useful for comparing the relative
impact of factors while equations with actual factors (eqs 3 and 5) are
suitable for predicting responses. Equations 3 and 5 cannot be used
to compare the relative impact of sonicator’s variables on
dispersion within each equation because the terms in these relationships
are corrected to accommodate for units. 2   3   4   5  

Tables S1 and S2 display the results obtained
from analysis of variance (ANOVA) of
the quadratic models developed for estimation of MWNT aggregates’
mean diameter and size distribution, respectively. The F-value of 8.32 and 12.7 imply that the models are significant.51 There is only a 0.01% chance that an F-value this large could occur because of noise. Values
of probability > F and less than 0.05 indicate
that
model terms are significant. In the case of MWNT aggregates’
mean diameter, there are five significant model terms (B, D, AB, BC,
and BD), whereas in the case of MWNT aggregates’ size distribution
six significant model terms were identified (B, D, AB, AD, BD, and
B2). The amplitude (B), pulse-off (D), sonication time
× amplitude (AB), and amplitude × pulse-off (BD) are common
significant model terms in the two models. In addition to these four
terms, amplitude × pulse-on duration (BC) term is significant
for MWNT aggregates’ mean diameter only. However, sonication
time × pulse-off (AD) and amplitude2 (B2) terms are significant for the MWNT aggregates’ size distribution
only. This implies that along with amplitude of vibration, the sonicator’s
pulse-on duration is influential to the mean aggregate diameter while
the size distribution is sensitive towards pulse-off duration. This
difference might be due to the system temperature regulation for MWNT
dispersion, which is often recommended in the literature.8,50,52 This might also be the reason
for the failure of sonication energy to describe dispersions (Figure S7) because sonication energy is unable
to account for the “duration” of pulse-off. The “lack
of fit values” for the two models were not found to be significant,
hence providing further evidence for their validity. There were 42
and 18.9% chances for the occurrence of lack of fit due to noise for
MWNT aggregate mean diameter and its size distribution, respectively.
When it came to regression of the models, a reasonable agreement (0.185
< 0.2) between predicted and adjusted R2 was observed for MWNT diameter but a little less than desired (0.27)
for MWNTs distribution. This can be attributed to the block effect
and/or outliers. The predictability of the model could be slightly
improved (5–10%) by transforming the response to square root
function but the significant variables as well as the shape of response
surface will be minimally altered. Therefore, the response was not
transformed. However, “adequate precision” value (i.e.,
signal-to-noise ratio) for both models was at least three times higher
than the required value of 4, allowing these models to navigate throughout
the design space. To conclude, ANOVA results supported the model.

All empirical models require confirmation runs even after statistical
approval.53Figure 2c,d correlate the experimental and predicted
(by model) values for MWNT aggregates’ mean diameter (Figure 2c) and size distribution
(Figure 2d). The plots
help to assess the distribution of actual experimental observations
in comparison to those predicted by the models. The experimental data
were found to be in good correlation with the predicted values. The
correlations were statistically significant; however, regression value
for MWNT aggregates’ diameter (Figure 2c) was lower than that for size distribution
(Figure 2d). It should
be noted that R2 is not the most reliable
test for goodness-of-fit for multiple linear regression analysis because
it can be affected (improved) by adding the statistically insignificant
terms.51,53 Therefore, adjusted R2 is often recommended. From Tables S1 and S2, the adjusted R2 values
of 0.64 and 0.78 can be evidenced, which approve the two models to
be statistically significant.

3.4 Effects
of Sonication Variables on MWNTs Dispersion
in Water
After statistical analysis and experimental validation,
the terms in the models were assessed for their role in producing
the responses. Pareto analysis is a useful tool to quantify the relative
contribution of terms in a model toward the overall response. Figure 3 presents the results
obtained from Pareto analysis. The magnitude of the terms, in the
model developed for MWNT aggregates’ mean diameter, can be
arranged in order of decreasing importance as follows: amplitude >
amplitude × pulse-off > pulse-off > time × amplitude
> amplitude
× pulse-on > pulse-on > time. The share of sonication parameters
in MWNT aggregates’ size distribution from highest to lowest
importance was amplitude > amplitude × pulse-off > amplitude2 > time × amplitude > pulse-off > time ×
pulse-off
> pulse-on > time × pulse-on > time. The most obvious
observation
made from these charts was the highest impact of sonication amplitude
on both responses (MWNT aggregates’ diameter and size distribution).
It also revealed the significance of “pulse-off”, which
is often an ignored parameter in the literature for sonication. Interestingly,
total sonication time, which is the most reported parameter to describe
sonication, carries the minimum weightage in both models. Its contribution
reaches above one percent only when it interacts with other parameters,
such as amplitude and pulse mode.

of sonicator’s
operational parameters influencing (a) mean diameter and (b) distribution
of MWNT aggregates.

3.5 Analysis
of Contours and Response Surface
Plots
The perturbation plot presented in Figure 4a shows the impact of individual
factors on the response. The plot is generated by keeping all variables
constant except for one, resulting in an estimation of an uninterrupted
impact of variables. The slope of the line, hence generated, is proportional
to the quantity of impact on the response. A positive slope corresponds
to an increase in the value of the response and vice versa. Figure 4a depicts an increase
in diameter of the MWNT aggregates upon increasing the time of sonication
and pulse-on duration and, conversely, a decrease in aggregate diameter
upon increasing amplitude and pulse-off duration. Hence, when it comes
to the effect posed by individual operational parameters of the sonicator,
amplitude of vibration causes the highest desired impact (i.e., steepest
negative slope) on the mean diameter of MWNT aggregates. To note,
the negative slope means a reduction in MWNT aggregate mean diameter
with an increase in amplitude. A similar trend of sonicator’s
operational parameters is observed for MWNT aggregates’ size
distribution (Figure 4e), except that the effect of amplitude is higher when compared with
that of MWNT aggregate’s mean diameter. In the absence of interaction
of factors, perturbation plots reveal that MWNT aggregates were reduced
in diameter and limited to a narrower size distribution by an increase
in amplitude, increase in pulse-off duration, decrease in total time
of sonication, and decrease in pulse-on duration.

amplitude, (g) amplitude and pulse-off duration, (h) sonication time
and pulse-on duration, and (i) sonication time and pulse-off duration
on the size distribution of MWNT aggregates in water.

Perturbation plots are good tools for exploiting
variables individually,
however, they cannot describe the interaction between factors and
their effect on responses.53 There is also
a significant contribution from interactions of factors as revealed
by Pareto analysis. Figure 4b shows the combined impact of sonication time and amplitude
on the mean diameter of MWNT aggregates. It displays the region where
the combined impact of [sonication time + amplitude] produces conditions
to generate MWNT aggregates of a narrowly defined diameter range.
This plot can be helpful for estimating the required amount of sonication
time and amplitude to obtain the desired range of MWNT aggregates
provided that pulse-on/off is kept constant at 30/30 s. Similarly, Figure 4c represents the
combined effects of [amplitude + pulse-off], and Figure 4d shows combined impacts of
[amplitude + pulse-on] on MWNT aggregates. Figure 4f–i evaluates combined effects of
factors on MWNT aggregates’ size distribution.

3.6 Optimization of Sonication Energy
The ultimate objective
of this study was to obtain well-dispersed
MWNTs in an aqueous system. The detailed criteria set to achieve this
goal can be seen in Table 3. Briefly, the entire range of sonicator’s parameters
was scanned to obtain conditions at which a small MWNT mean aggregate
size with a narrow size distribution could be achieved. Figure S8 shows these ramps of defined desirability.
The flat ramps represent uniform desirability, whereas the negative
slope of the ramps represent the minimization of numerical value (MWNT
aggregate diameter and MWNT distribution) defined in the optimization
criteria. The factors and responses are represented by blue and red
dots, respectively. As shown in Figure S8, 96.7% of the set criteria can be achieved by sonicating MWNTs for
89 s, keeping the amplitude at 144 μm, and pulse-on/off cycle
of 44/30 s. Also, on the basis of these settings, 863 J sonication
energy will be consumed (per mL water) during this process. The two-dimensional
contour plot in Figure 5a displays the “Flag” where maximum desirability can
be achieved with respect to the optimal sonicator settings listed
in Table 3. Figure 5b–d represents
the corresponding sonication energies, MWNT aggregates’ mean
diameter, and MWNT aggregates’ size distribution, respectively,
for the optimal settings (Table 3 and Figure 5a).

Optimization criteria are described in Table 3.

4 Conclusions
The following conclusions were derived from this study:1. Sonication
is a useful tool to disperse
MWNTs in water, provided that it is used with appropriate understanding.

2. Dispersion of MWNTs in
water depends
on amplitude, sonication time, and the pulse mode of the sonicator.

3. RSM can be utilized to
understand and
optimize the MWNT macrodispersions in water.

4. MWNT dispersion in water by sonication
is not the function of individual sonication parameter whether it
be sonication time, amplitude, or pulse mode.

5. MWNT dispersion in water is not proportional
to the magnitude of sonication energy provided to the system.

6. Total time of sonication,
which corresponds
to magnitude of sonication energy, cannot alone describe the dispersion
of MWNTs in water.

7. The
amplitude of sonicator’s
vibration collectively (alone and in combination with other parameters)
contributes over 75% toward dispersing MWNTs as portended by Pareto
analysis.

8. “Pulse-off”
duration
of sonicator plays an important role in the dispersion of MWNTs in
water.

9. In our [MWNT–water-sonication]
system, the desired diameter (2 ± 0.5 μm) and distribution
of MWNT aggregates were obtained by optimizing sonicator’s
parameters to sonication time of 89 s, amplitude of 144 μm,
and pulse-on/off cycle of 44/30 s. During this process, 863 J/mL sonication
energy was expended to disperse 100 mg/L MWNTs in a 30 mL aliquot
of deionized water.

10. This optimization process can be adopted
(with modification) for other [particle-solvent/aqueous-sonication]
systems where appropriate dispersions are required such as synthesis
of graphene from graphite-diethyl ether-sonication.54
