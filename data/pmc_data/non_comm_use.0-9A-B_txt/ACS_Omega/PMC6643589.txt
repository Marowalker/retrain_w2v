Interest
in the production of β zeolites in the absence of
organic structure-directing agent (OSDA) has continued to grow consistently
during the past decade. During this time, numerous strategies have
been proposed to manipulate the hierarchy of zeolite pore structures
in order to facilitate the transport of bulky reactants and to improve
the accessibility of active sites in zeolite catalysts. In this work,
we describe an organotemplate-free route to produce hierarchical β
zeolites. Using OSDA-free β as the starting zeolites, we explored
the applicability of various postsynthetic approaches to create hierarchical
structures with mesoporosity, including framework stabilization, dealumination,
conventional desilication, and hydrothermal desilication. While framework
stabilization and dealumination were not effective in generating mesoporosity,
they were necessary as modification steps to determine the efficacy
of hierarchical structure creation. Compared to conventional desilication,
hydrothermal desilication produces larger mesopores and much better
preservation of microporosity and acidity because of the occurrence
of recrystallization. The cost-effective, scalable production of organotemplate-free
hierarchical β zeolites could greatly enhance the adoption of
β zeolites in oil refining and petrochemical industries, where
the advantages of hierarchically structured zeolites can dramatically
improve catalytic performances in formulated catalysts.

Introduction
Zeolite β is
already a commercially relevant material for
oil refining and petrochemical industries, featuring a three-dimensional
large-pore and low-Al framework with an intergrowth of two or more
polymorphs.1−3 β zeolite synthesis typically involves the
use of organic templates as “structure-directing agent”
(OSDA) such as tetraethylammonium cations (TEA+) to direct
the assembly pathway during zeolite crystallization. When compared
to other commercially relevant zeolites (e.g. Y zeolites for fluid
catalytic cracking and hydrocracking) that do not require OSDAs, the
use of OSDA in β zeolite synthesis increases the overall cost
of zeolite production and also leads to additional energy expenditure
and environmental burden when the OSDA is removed at the end of the
synthesis process. For these reasons, the OSDA-free synthesis of β
zeolite would enable the adoption of this important zeolite to be
even more widespread in industries. Although zeolite β synthesis
was once believed to require organic templates, it was nearly a decade
ago that OSDA-free synthesis of β zeolite was reported and used
zeolite β seeds to facilitate crystallization.4 This result generated industrial attention and spurred
numerous follow-on studies to understand the crystallization mechanism
and product characteristics.5−9 In the past decade, the seed-directed organotemplate-free synthesis
has been successfully applied to a series of other types of zeolites
and represents a critical achievement in promoting sustainable chemistry
for zeolite production.10−12

More recently, zeolite-related
research has focused on the creation
of the hierarchical pore structure. In this usage, hierarchical refers to the presence of at least one additional pore system, typically
in the mesopore size range, in addition to the intrinsic zeolite microporosity.13−15 This additional mesoporosity is believed to be beneficial for enhancing
accessibility to the active sites and reducing transport limitation
for bulky reactants that are ubiquitous in oil refining and petrochemical
applications. Because zeolite β is one of the most important
industrial solid-acid catalysts, the creation of hierarchical β
zeolites has been explored by a variety of synthetic strategies, including
both bottom-up and top-down routes.16−29 Bottom-up approaches creates hierarchical zeolites by building up
microporous and mesoporous segments in the presence of various templating
materials or by nanocrystal aggregation. Alternatively, top-down approaches
start with existed microporous zeolites that are postsynthetically
modified to create mesoporosity. Ideally, hierarchical zeolites should
possess comparable acidity and crystallinity with respect to their
microporous zeolites.

As compared to bottom-up methods, top-down
desilication is a highly
reproducible and scalable approach to create hierarchical zeolite
structures. These advantages make top-down desilication a preferred
approach for commercial production of hierarchical zeolites.30−32 Pioneering research on desilication in MFI-type zeolites revealed
the critical role of framework Al content in determining the efficiency
of base leaching. It was demonstrated that only zeolites with appropriate
Al contents could be leached in a one-step process that simultaneously
created mesopores and preserved micropores.33 With high Al contents in zeolites, very limited mesoporosity was
created, while high silica constituents resulted in excessive Si extraction
and framework dissolution. For β zeolites, previous studies
demonstrated that mesoporosity could be obtained directly by a one-step
NaOH leaching process with preservation of microstructure from parent
zeolites containing relatively higher Al contents (Si/Al < 20).27−29 These studies also revealed that because the high Si β framework
(Si/Al > 20) is very sensitive to alkaline solutions, the presence
of pore-directing agents (PDAs) is needed to protect the crystallinity
and microporosity of the original zeolite framework during mesopore
formation. While tetraalkylammonium salts/hydroxides and nonionic
organic amines are frequently used as PDAs, the average mesopore size
can be manipulated by selecting differently structured PDAs.34 The PDA structure–mesopore property relationship
was established between the PDA structure and average mesopore sizes
in the resulting hierarchical β zeolites.35

While these results demonstrate the use of top-down
approaches
to produce hierarchical zeolites, the synthesis of the starting β
zeolites themselves usually require organic templates (i.e. TEAOH).
To fill this gap, the recently developed seed-directed OSDA-free strategy
serves as a promising alternative to provide the starting zeolites
for subsequent desilication. To date, there have been no literature
reports on the hierarchical structure creation by top-down approaches
using OSDA-free β zeolites. OSDA-free β zeolites have
Si/Al ratios typically in the range of 4–7 because more aluminosilicate
species are needed to balance the electrostatic interactions with
the smaller alkaline cations (with high charge densities) during crystallization.
Thus, one prominent feature of OSDA-free β zeolite is its high
Al content as compared to TEA-β zeolites. The hydrophobic interaction
between alkyl-rich organic templates (with low charge density) and
silicate species usually results in zeolite crystallization with relatively
higher silica contents. Owing to this salient compositional feature,
it is an open question whether the Si/Al range for the direct NaOH
desilication of TEA-β zeolites (i.e. Si/Al < 20) could be
readily extended to the high Al region (e.g. Si/Al < 10).

To drive further improvements in synthesis efficiencies for OSDA-free
β synthesis, additional insights can be gleaned by examining
the desilication conditions. Conventional top-down desilication creates
mesoporosity in NaOH solutions at atmospheric pressures and at low
temperatures (e.g. ∼65 °C) and avoids framework destruction
that usually derives from excessive leaching and dissolution at higher
temperatures and/or pressures.26,36−38 Under these conventional conditions, recrystallization does not
occur, and the resulting hierarchical zeolites sacrifice some microporosity
and crystallinity (with reference to the starting zeolites) due to
the destructive nature of desilication. We recently reported an organotemplate-free
hydrothermal desilication process for the creation of hierarchical
structures in β zeolites by treating microporous β zeolite
under hydrothermal conditions that are favorable for crystallization.
Under these conditions, we simultaneously create mesoporosity while
maintaining high crystallinity and framework integrity without using
any OSDAs, PDAs, or mesoporous templates.39 The resulting hierarchical β zeolites featured enlarged mesopores
with peak mesopore sizes in the range of 20–30 nm and well-preserved
characteristic acidity. The occurrence of recrystallization is evidenced
by an inflection in microporosity during the synthesis process. In
this process, an initial decrease in microporosity is due to the dissolution
(mesopore creation) but is then followed by an increase in microporosity
(recrystallization) under appropriate hydrothermal conditions. On
the basis of these results, it is indeed intriguing to explore the
applicability of this approach to complete OSDA-free synthesis of
hierarchical β zeolites.

In this work, the creation of
hierarchical structures of β
zeolites is studied by top-down alkaline leaching (desilication) using
OSDA-free β zeolites as starting materials. Specifically, the
study focuses on designing a complete organotemplate-free synthesis
to introduce mesoporosity in β zeolites to enhance scalability,
manufacturability, and cost considerations that are important for
industry adoption. The understanding of mesopore creation in an organotemplate-free
route may further enhance the impact of β zeolites in oil refining
and petrochemical industry, where hierarchically structured zeolites
can improve catalytic performances in formulated catalysts.

Results
and Discussion
Seed-assisted OSDA-free β zeolites were
successfully synthesized
according to a modified procedure reported in the literature.40 The silica-based yield was significantly increased
to 65–70 wt % because of an increase in Al content in the precursor
gel, whereas the conventional OSDA-free β synthesis usually
led to a silica-based yield below 30 wt %.41Figure 1 shows the
X-ray diffraction (XRD), Ar physisorption isotherm, scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption
(NH3-TPD) characterization results. The OSDA-free zeolite
exhibits characteristic XRD peaks (for β zeolite) with a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area and external surface area of 540 and 64 m2/g, respectively. The sorption isotherm exhibits no distinct desorption
hysteresis, indicating a lack of mesoporosity within the crystals.
The Si/Al ratio of the as-synthesized OSDA-free β is 4.7 as
confirmed by both energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) and inductively coupled
plasma (ICP) analysis. From NH3-TPD, the total acidity
is 1.31 mmol/g and the maximum desorption temperature is around 319
°C. Intriguingly, the particles of OSDA-free β zeolites
are aggregates of nanocrystals in the size range of several hundred
nanometers, which are comparable with the size of seeding β
crystals. The presence of more Al nutrients in the synthesis gel may
facilitate nucleation under the current synthetic conditions that
led to the formation of nanoaggregates of OSDA-free β zeolites.

Figure 1 Characterization
of OSDA-free β zeolite: (a) XRD (b) argon
sorption isotherm (−186 °C) (c) SEM (d) NH3-TPD.

For the as-synthesized β
zeolites, no additional mesoporosity
was created after being treated directly in alkaline solutions. After
conventional desilication, the external surface area of the treated
β zeolite increased to 79 m2/g, while the micropore
volume slightly decreased to 0.26 cm3/g (from 0.28 cm3/g) (Supporting Information: Table
S1). When the OSDA-free β zeolites were exposed to hydrothermal
desilication conditions, the crystals suffered significant loss in
crystallinity and micropore volume (0.11 cm3/g) as well
as the occurrence of polymorphism as demonstrated by the XRD characteristic
peaks (Supporting Information: Figure S1).
Therefore, the high Al content in OSDA-free β zeolites not only
retarded the creation of mesoporosity by desilication, but also resulted
in a decline in framework stability under hydrothermal conditions.

Our previous study revealed that β zeolites with Si/Al >
20 are not stable in alkaline solutions (0.2 M NaOH, 65 °C) and
additional organic PDAs are needed to protect the framework and direct
the mesopore formation.29 Therefore, for
an OSDA-free approach, we needed to develop a dealumination procedure
to modify the Al content in OSDA-free β zeolites toward a preferable
Si/Al ratio <20 (to avoid using any organic PDAs in the following
step of mesopore creation). Several reported works in this area demonstrated
that the modification on Al content can be achieved by an acid treatment
in diluted nitric acid solutions for β zeolites.42−44 However, we found that OSDA-free β zeolites are not stable
in diluted nitric acid solutions (0.05–0.2 M) and that the
crystalline structure deteriorated with significant amorphization
after such an acid treatment (80 °C for 2 h). The OSDA-free β
zeolites with high Al contents are not stable in acidic (diluted HNO3 solutions at 80 °C under atmospheric pressure) and basic
(NaOH at 150 °C under hydrothermal conditions) environments.

In order to improve structural stability, the OSDA-free β
zeolites were ion-exchanged to NH4-form and then calcined
at 750 °C in air for 15 h. This step was demonstrated to be very
effective in improving framework stability of the OSDA-free β
zeolites against acid treatments.42 At
such temperatures, the zeolite crystals experience minor framework
dealumination induced by steaming as well as a condensation at defect
sites. The characteristic XRD peaks (Supporting Information: Figure S2) shifted to slightly higher angles after
calcination (the corresponding d spacing values decreased) because
the average Si–O bond length is shorter than that of Al–O
when Al atoms are extracted from the framework during the calcination
process. Note that the static calcination does not change the bulk
Si/Al ratio in zeolites but creates more extra framework Al species
(EFAL) (Supporting Information: Figure
S3). 29Si NMR characterization demonstrates a reduction
in Q3 Si species in the calcined zeolites, which is due to the condensation
of silanol groups (generation of Si–O–Si bonds) during
calcination (Supporting Information: Figure
S4). Because the Si–O bond energy is much higher than that
of the Al–O bond, the calcined samples are anticipated to have
much improved stability. Indeed, the calcined β zeolites have
well-preserved crystallinity and are stable in diluted nitric acid
solutions for dealumination (Supporting Information: Figure S5). The slight dealumination led to an increase in the
external surface area for the stabilized β zeolite [but no observable
additional mesoporosity in the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) or nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) pore size distribution
(PSD)], which is likely due to the creation of smaller pores at or
smaller than 2 nm. The total pore volume increased slightly from 0.33
cm3/g (for OSDA-free β) to 0.35 cm3/g.

Meanwhile, introduction of mesoporosity directly in the stabilized
zeolite by desilication is still not feasible. Neither conventional
nor hydrothermal desilication creates discernable additional external
surface areas due to the high Al contents within stabilized β
zeolites. However, unlike the as-synthesized zeolites, the stabilized
OSDA-free β can be readily dealuminated by an acid treatment
with well-preserved crystallinity (Supporting Information: Figure S5), and the Si/Al ratios can be continuously
manipulated by changing the concentrations of the nitric acid solutions
(Figure 2). Similar
to the stabilization, dealumination by acid treatment resulted in
the creation of additional micropores (with a corresponding increase
in micropore volume) and external surface areas but with no remarkable
generation of porosity in the mesopore range. The Ar sorption isotherms
do not show distinct desorption hysteresis loops (Supporting Information: Figure S6). Therefore, even though
acid treatment is effective in modifying the framework Al content
and acidity, it must be combined with other strategies (i.e. desilication)
in order to create hierarchical structures with open and accessible
mesopores.

Figure 2 Si/Al ratios of stabilized OSDA-free β zeolites after acid
treatment in diluted nitric acid solution (80 °C, 2 h).

In the following work, the creation
of hierarchical structure and
mesoporosity was investigated using a dealuminated OSDA-free β
sample with a Si/Al ratio of ∼14 (after acid treatment in 0.13
M HNO3, Figure 2). This ratio was selected for two reasons, namely: (i) this
Si/Al ratio is in the identified range for the 1-step NaOH desilication
without the need for organic agents to protect the framework during
mesopore generation (Si/Al < 20) and (ii) this Si/Al ratio is comparable
to the Si/Al ratio in some TEA-β zeolites. Thus, we can conveniently
compare the effectiveness of mesopore creation by conventional and
hydrothermal desilication in the OSDA-free β zeolites with what
has been reported in the literature for TEA-β zeolites, and
we can compare the corresponding changes in acidity and porous properties.

Distinct differences in the hierarchical TEA-β zeolites after
conventional desilication or hydrothermal desilication under identical
alkalinity are the mesopore sizes (or pore volumes) and the preservation
of microporosity.39 In conventional desilication,
the leaching temperature is not sufficiently high to induce recrystallization,
so the resulting hierarchical β zeolite demonstrated lower micropore
volume compared with the starting β zeolite but had higher external
surface areas due to the creation of mesopores.29 Therefore, the optimal scenario for hierarchical zeolites
via conventional desilication is to obtain mesoporosity without sacrificing
micropore volume and crystallinity significantly through the rational
selection of parent zeolites with appropriate Al contents and the
basicity of the leaching solutions. In hydrothermal desilication,
the occurrence of recrystallization facilitated the regaining of crystallinity
and microporosity after the initial base leaching and mesopore creation.
Meanwhile, the hydrothermal desilication can be completed in an organotemplate-free
environment with the partially dissolved starting zeolites serving
as seeds for local recrystallization. Thus, the hydrothermal desilication
actually serves as a hybrid top-down and bottom-up approach to obtain
hierarchically structured zeolites possessing notably larger mesopores
and greater total pore volumes when compared to hierarchical zeolites
created by conventional desilication.39

Table 1 summarized
the Si/Al ratios and porous properties of the representative β
zeolites used in this study. Figure 3 shows the XRD patterns, Ar physisorption isotherms,
NLDFT PSD, and NH3-TPD results for the two hierarchical
β zeolites via conventional and hydrothermal desilication. As
shown, both samples exhibited characteristic β crystalline structures,
but the conventionally desilicated zeolite has relatively lower crystallinity
with weaker peak intensity (Figure 3a). Ar sorption isotherms (Figure 3b) and NLDFT PSD (Figure 3c) revealed the significant differences in
porous properties between these two mesoporous zeolites. Hierarchical
β zeolite by conventional desilication shows a much higher external
surface area (393 m2/g) with smaller mesopores, but suffers
from a discernable (∼25%) decrease in the micropore volume
(to 0.21 cm3/g). In comparison, the hydrothermally desilicated
hierarchical β zeolite exhibits larger mesopores with ideal
preservation of the micropore volume (0.28 cm3/g). These
features are consistent with those of hierarchical β zeolites
using TEA-β as parent zeolites. A sequential desilication and
recrystallization mechanism was proposed to elucidate the creation
of larger mesopores and the ideal preservation of microporosity (in
hierarchical β zeolite after hydrothermal desilication).39 Upon contacting the alkaline solution during
the heating process, desilication accompanies mesopore formation.
For hydrothermal desilication (150 °C), the destructive effect
is more severe on the parent β framework leading to the creation
of larger mesopores (and/or macropores) during the initial stage of
synthesis. When the synthesis proceeds for an extended time under
hydrothermal conditions, the environment becomes favorable for zeolite
crystallization. Partially dissolved hierarchically structured zeolites
serve as seeds for local recrystallization, similar to the seed-directed
OSDA-free synthesis of β zeolites. The occurrence of (re)crystallization
is constrained locally without discernable crystal growth because
there are no additional aluminosilicate sources, and the recrystallization
may only rely on the limited dissolved aluminosilicate species from
the starting zeolites. The differences in the preservation of microporosity
and crystallinity resulted in strikingly different acidity in the
resulting hierarchical zeolites, as demonstrated in the weight-normalized
NH3-TPD curves. Hydrothermal desilication leads to the
creation of hierarchical β zeolite with much higher total amounts
of acid sites (a total acidity of 0.76 mmol/g according to NH3-TPD). The maximum desorption temperature (Td,max) is around 345 °C, which is higher than that
of OSDA-free β (319 °C, Figure 1) because of the greater separation of Al
sites after dealumination as well as well-preserved microporosity
after introduction of mesoporosity. In comparison, the conventionally
desilicated β zeolite shows a Td,max around 286 °C due to the partial amorphization upon base leaching.

b Peak dmeso is the peak mesopore
size according to PSDs from the BJH method
(adsorption branch). For the first three samples (entry 1–3)
in the table, no additional PSD peaks in the mesopore region were
observed, and the main size distributions are around 2 nm. The numbers
in parentheses are the average mesopore sizes.

Upon hydrothermal desilication,
both TEA-β and dealuminated
OSDA-free β undergo the creation of hierarchical structures
with peak mesopore sizes of 20–30 nm. However, hierarchical
β zeolite from OSDA-free β shows smaller average mesopore
sizes (∼7.0 nm) than that from TEA-β (∼10.0 nm),39 which is due to the larger contribution of smaller
mesopores within the dealuminated OSDA-free β zeolite. As discussed
previously, the OSDA-free β needs to be stabilized and then
acid-treated before mesopore creation in alkaline solutions. These
treatments resulted in framework dealumination with the formation
of EFAL species and additional porosity in the small mesopore range
(∼2 nm) that reduced the overall average mesopore sizes. Such
pretreatments are not necessary for TEA-β zeolite because of
its relatively lower initial framework Al content. On the other hand,
the stabilization and dealumination seem to weaken the framework resistance
to base leaching under conventional desilication conditions. The hierarchical
β zeolite from the dealuminated OSDA-free β zeolite possessed
much higher external surface area than hierarchical zeolite from TEA-β
as well as lower crystallinity and microporosity (after conventional
desilication).29

Figure 4 shows SEM
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of hydrothermally
desilicated hierarchical β zeolite. SEM shows apparent grooves
and cracks on the crystalline surfaces that contribute to the hierarchical
structure. TEM demonstrates the existence of additional mesoporosity
within well-defined β zeolite crystals. Cumene sorption uptake
curves were measured on hierarchical β zeolite (after hydrothermal
desilication, H-form) and microporous OSDA-free β (Figure 5). It is clear that
the sorption proceeds much faster toward equilibrium for hierarchical
β zeolite than the microporous β. The solution for the
transient diffusion equation for a spherical particle is expressed
as45 1

From the uptake
curves in Figure 5,
the transport diffusivity can be calculated by assuming
identical spherical crystals for both hierarchical and microporous
β zeolites. The differences in the uptake curves translate into
more than 1 order of magnitude improvement in transport diffusivity
for the hierarchical β zeolite at 35 °C (1.4 × 10–18 m2/s). Therefore, both microscopic characterization
and sorption rate measurements corroborated the existence of open
and accessible mesopores, which is in stark contrast with the enclosed
mesoporosity within dealuminated zeolite Y crystals that may not provide
preferable diffusional improvements for bulky molecules.46

Conclusions
In this work, we have
demonstrated an organotemplate-free route
to synthesize hierarchical β zeolites from OSDA-free β
zeolites. The as-synthesized OSDA-free β zeolite suffered stability
drawbacks in both acidic and basic environments because of the exceptionally
high Al contents. Framework stabilization was achieved by static calcination
(on the NH4-form zeolites) in air at 750 °C, during
which a slight dealumination and condensation occurred with the formation
of more stable Si–O–Si bonds. In order to introduce
mesoporosity, the stabilized β zeolites were dealuminated in
diluted nitric acid solutions because the static stabilization did
not alter the bulk Si/Al ratio of OSDA-free β zeolites. The
Al content modification by such an acid treatment is highly controllable
and the Si/Al ratios of the resulting zeolites can be continuously
manipulated. The creation of the hierarchical structure was achieved
on appropriately dealuminated β zeolites in alkaline solutions
under atmospheric or hydrothermal conditions. While mesopososity can
be introduced by both approaches, the resulting hierarchical zeolites
exhibited strikingly different properties. Conventional desilication
resulted in the generation of smaller mesopores and much larger external
surface areas but suffered a loss in crystallinity, microporosity,
acid site strength, and total acidity. In comparison, the hierarchical
β zeolites by hydrothermal desilication possess much larger
mesopores with ideally preserved microporosity and acidity due to
the occurrence of recrystallization. Because the hydrothermal synthetic
step does not involve any organic templates, this work demonstrates
the feasibility of producing hierarchical β zeolites via an
organotemplate-free route without sacrificing intrinsic microporosity
and acidity of β zeolites.

Experimental Section
Synthesis
of OSDA-Free β Zeolites
OSDA-free β
zeolite was synthesized using colloidal silica according to a modified
procedure reported in the literature.40 To prepare the starting synthesis gel, 1.92 g NaOH was dissolved
in 24.8 g H2O. The solution was then mixed with 0.89 g
Al(OH)3 and stirred for 30 min at room temperature. Then,
16 g 30% Ludox colloidal silica was added. The mixture was stirred
for another 3 h. Once a uniform synthesis gel was obtained, 15 wt
% zeolite β seeds (0.72 g, Si/Al = 14, wt % based on silica)
was added into the gel and the mixture was stirred for 30 min to produce
a uniform dispersion of seeding crystals in the gel. The molar composition
of the starting synthesis gel was: 1SiO2:0.1425Al(OH)3:0.6NaOH:25H2O. Finally, the hydrothermal synthesis
was completed at 140 °C for 4 days.

Postsynthetic Treatments
of OSDA-Free β Zeolites
The as-synthesized OSDA-free
β zeolites underwent different
postsynthetic treatments to modify framework content, to create mesoporosity,
and to enhance framework stability. The OSDA-free zeolites (NH4-form) were stabilized by a calcination step at 750 °C
in air for 15 h. The NH4-form zeolites were obtained by
triple ammonium exchange in 0.8 M NH4NO3 at
80 °C for 2 h. Framework dealumination was then achieved by acid
treatment in diluted HNO3 solutions at 80 °C for 2
h with a weight to solution volume ratio of 1 g zeolite in 50 mL HNO3 solution.

Two base leaching treatments were pursued
using different approaches in 0.2 M NaOH solutions, referred to as conventional desilication (65 °C for 30 min) and hydrothermal desilication (150 °C for 21 h) in this
article. In all desilication treatments, starting zeolites were added
into the NaOH solutions to make a suspension with a NaOH/Si ratio
of 0.35 and a resulting H2O/Si ratio of 97. The alkaline-treated
zeolites were retrieved by quenching, centrifuging, washing with distilled
water, and drying in an oven at 110 °C. For protonic form β
zeolites, the ammonium-exchanged zeolites were calcined at 550 °C
for 5 h at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Note that the applied
hydrothermal desilication conditions are the most favorable conditions
(in the temperature range of 100–220 °C and mediated alkalinity
range of 0.05–0.55 for hydrothermal desilication) in terms
of preserving microporosity and generating mesoporosity by this approach
using the same starting β zeolite.

Characterization
A Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer
was used for powder XRD characterization (a copper tube and a VANTEC-500
2-D detector) in the 2θ range of 5°–40°. SEM
images were analyzed by a JEOL JSM-7100F with an Oxford EDX spectroscopy
system. TEM characterization was completed by a JEOL 2010F TEM/scanning
TEM with a Gatan OneView 4k × 4k camera (200 kV). TEM samples
were prepared by casting sample suspensions in ethanol on a carbon-coated
copper grid. Argon (Ar) physisorption isotherms were obtained at −186 °C
on a Micromeritics ASAP 2460. All samples were degassed at 350 °C
overnight under vacuum by Micromeritics Smart VacPrep. The surface
areas were estimated by the BET approach in the P/Po range of 0.02–0.10. The mesopore
size distribution was obtained by the NLDFT method. The same method
is also applied to obtain micropore volume (Vmic) and total pore volume (Vtot) by converting original sorption data in the Quantachrome’s
data reduction software (based on the model of Ar at −186 °C
on a zeolite with cylindrical pores). NH3-TPD analysis
was performed by Micromeritics AutoChem II equipped with a flow-through
reactor connected to a thermal conductivity detector. The samples
were degassed at 580 °C for 1 h followed by the adsorption of
ammonia at 180 °C. The NH3-adsorbed zeolites were
purged in helium flow gas for another 5 h at 180 °C to minimize
NH3 physisorption. Then, the TPD signals were recorded
by heating the samples from 180 °C at a rate of 15 °C/min
in a helium flow to the target temperature. The cumene vapor adsorption
experiments were performed on an IGA-100 sorption analyzer at 35 °C
(relative pressure of 0.10). The vapor relative pressure was controlled
automatically by mixing the wet vapor feed with a dry N2 line that serves as a carrier gas for the vapors. The “dry
mass” of the samples was weighted under N2 atmosphere
before feeding vapors to the sample chamber.
