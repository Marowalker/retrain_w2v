Ethanol produced
from renewable sources (i.e., bioethanol) is a
first-generation biofuel that is currently being added as a biocomponent
into gasolines. Mixtures of ethanol and gasoline are designated as
ethanol–gasoline blends (EGBs). Ethanol has high polarity and
moisture affinity, which considerably influence the properties of
the resulting EGBs including their aggressiveness to many metallic
and nonmetallic materials. The corrosion aggressiveness of EGBs can
be minimized by suitable corrosion inhibitors. In this study, we tested
three different corrosion inhibitors on mild steel in the environment
of aggressive E10, E25, E60, and E85 fuels. The inhibitors tested
were diethylene triamine (DETA) and two mixed inhibitors containing
propargyl alcohol, dibenzyl sulfoxide, and octadecyl amine. To study
the efficiency of the corrosion inhibitors, we used static and dynamic
corrosion tests and electrochemical measurements including impedance
spectroscopy and potentiodynamic polarization. The highest corrosion
aggressiveness on mild steel was observed for the E60 fuel. The highest
inhibitory efficiency was, for all the fuels tested, observed for
the DETA inhibitor. For the DETA concentration of 100 mg·L–1, the inhibitory efficiency in the E60 fuel was determined
to be around 98%.

1 Introduction
Modern society is significantly
dependent on energy from fossil
fuels, which are limited and exhaustible. Thus, the threat of energy
shortage is becoming more serious considering the ever-increasing
energy consumption of mankind. This and other (especially environmental)
factors lead toward renewable and more environmentally friendly alternative
energy sources, especially in mobile transportation.

There are
a number of potentially available biofuels. Among them,
bioethanol produced by biomass fermentation seems to be the most attractive
substitute of fossil gasolines.1 In 1970,
Brazil introduced the first large bioethanol program called ProAlcool
with a vision to replace part of the gasoline consumption by bioethanol.
This program contributed to a more active research on bioethanol and
to a more intensive effort to reduce the production costs of bioethanol.2

Currently, the United States is the biggest
producer of bioethanol
(from corn) and is followed by Brazil (from sugarcane). Their combined
bioethanol production covers about 80% of the worldwide production.3 The European Union accounts for about 3% of the
worldwide bioethanol production, and the main sources are wheat and
sugar beet.1 The majority of bioethanol
is used in Brazil. About 20% of cars in Brazil use pure bioethanol
(E100) and the rest burn E22 or E85 fuels.4

In the European Union, the bioethanol content in conventional
fuels
is limited by legislation that sets the oxygen content to 2.7 wt %
and the bioethanol content to 5 vol %; an increase in the bioethanol
content to 10 vol % is being considered.5,6 In the Czech
Republic, an obligatory blending of conventional gasolines with 4.1
vol % of ethanol has been set by legislation since June 2010.7 Fuels with an ethanol content of up to 5 vol
% have to meet the requirements of the ČSN EN 228 standard
and fuels with higher ethanol contents (E85) have to meet the requirements
of the ČSN P CEN/TS 15293 standard.

Ethanol intended
to be used as a gasoline component must be pure,
without haze, anhydrous (absolute), and denatured. The ethanol content
before and after the denaturation must be higher than 99.7 and 95.6
vol %, respectively.

The blending of gasolines with bioethanol
is related to several
different problems that are caused by the different chemical nature
of bioethanol and hydrocarbon-based gasolines. Besides some other
problems, material compatibility of metallic or nonmetallic construction
materials with ethanol can be very problematic, especially for fuels
with higher ethanol contents. Conversely, fuels containing less than
10 vol % of ethanol should not exhibit such problems.8 The problematic material compatibility can be
caused by the corrosion aggressiveness of the ethanol–gasoline
blends (EGBs), which is related to the higher polarity of ethanol
and its ability to increase the solubility of water in the EGBs. The
corrosion aggressiveness of the EGBs can be promoted by chlorides
that can be dissolved in water because of water contamination caused
by the failure to comply with good transportation and storage conditions;
alternatively, ethanol itself can be a source of undesirable chlorides
also. Also, the solubility of oxygen in EGBs can have a negative impact
on the corrosion aggressiveness of the EGBs as oxygen can be a part
of the corrosion reactions as a depolarizer. The dissolved oxygen
can help to oxidize some unsaturated gasoline compounds to peroxides
and acidic substances that are corrosion agents for some metallic
materials.8−10 The corrosion effects of EGBs are mostly exhibited
on the metallic part of fuel systems and on internal engine components.
Corrosion in fuel systems can be inhibited using corrosion inhibitors.11,12 This kind of anticorrosion protection has perspective all over the
world because of its good efficiency and low costs. Corrosion inhibitors
are being used in many applications including refrigeration systems,
water heaters, refineries, and the chemical industry in general.13−21

For the effective use of corrosion inhibitors, it is important
to know their action mechanism as there is no versatile inhibitor
that would be efficient for all corrosion environments or for all
materials. To choose an efficient inhibitor, it is necessary to consider
several factors including environment properties, inhibitory properties,
the potential presence of corrosion agents, and so forth.22

There is no versatile classification of
inhibitors. Thus, to achieve
an easier orientation in a huge number of applicable inhibitors, it
is suitable to characterize the type of industry and the type of corrosion
environments. Corrosion environments can be divided into aqueous and
nonaqueous as the nature and the intensity of corrosion processes
significantly differ in such environments. In aqueous environments,
electrochemical corrosion occurs, whereas electrochemical and chemical
corrosion occur in nonaqueous environments.23

In the crude oil refining industry, anticorrosion protection
is
very important, and significant attention is paid to the upstream
to downstream processes. Here, corrosion processes are inhibited by
a combination of suitable materials, anticorrosion coatings, electrochemical
protection, corrosion inhibitors, and so forth. Corrosion inhibitors
protect metal surfaces either by sorbing on the metal surface or by
reacting with the corrosion-active compounds.24 Another action mechanism of the corrosion inhibitors includes the
formation of a thin protective polymeric layer on the surface.25 For the crude oil industry, the inhibitors composed
of amines with long chains or fatty amides or imidazolines or fatty
acids, and their salts seem to be the most efficient. These inhibitors
can be used in concentration ranges of 50–200 mg·kg–1.26 For crude oil transportation
and storage, inhibitors containing propargyl alcohol can be used.
For the protection of equipment for the atmospheric distillation of
crude oils, inhibitors containing dibenzyl sulfoxide, heterocyclic
nitrogen bases, and low-molecular-weight amines seem to be the most
efficient.

There are a number of publications in which the protective
effects
of different corrosion inhibitors on different materials in aqueous
or nonaqueous environments were demonstrated.27−31 The efficiency of the corrosion inhibitors and mechanisms
of their action can be studied in different laboratory flow apparatuses
that simulate the corrosion of metallic materials in different environments.32 Electrochemical methods have widely been applied
to study corrosion processes in metal–fuel systems.33−38 Also, electrochemical methods have been used to study the inhibitory
effects of ethanol amine in the EGBs.39,40

Furthermore,
the action mechanism of many steel corrosion inhibitors
in the aqueous solutions of hydrochloric acid or sodium chloride was
studied; chitosan,20,41 Schiff bases,15,42−44 bis-(benzimidazole) derivatives,45 porphyrin,46 pyrazine,16 and glucosamine-based, pyrimidine-fused heterocycles,47 and so forth were used as steel corrosion inhibitors
in these studies. In many cases, environmentally friendly, the so-called
“green corrosion inhibitors” are being sought.15,18−20,47 Such corrosion inhibitors
have low ecotoxicity and could also be applicable for crude oil extraction.16,20

Also, the influence of the addition of TiO2 nanoparticles
on the inhibition of the natural steel corrosion inhibitor based on
the extracts48,49 in an environment of EGBs was
tested.49 The study demonstrated the beneficial
effect of these nanoparticles on inhibition.49

The aim of this work was to test the efficiency of the selected
steel corrosion inhibitors. Steel corrosion inhibition is of utmost
importance as steel is the most common construction material in the
automotive industry and is also used for the construction of fuel
systems that come into contact with fuels containing different amounts
of corrosive ethanol. Three different inhibitors were tested: (i +
ii) two mixed inhibitors (MIs) containing propargyl alcohol, dibenzyl
sulfoxide, and octadecyl amine and the (iii) diethylenetriamine (DETA)
inhibitor. The MIs were chosen as they have been used as corrosion
inhibitors for the transportation, storage, and processing of crude
oils. The choice of the DETA inhibitor is justified by the fact that
it is known as an efficient inhibitor for aqueous environments and
is cost-effective and relatively easily available. Different gravimetric
methods (static and dynamic) and electrochemical methods were applied
for testing and all of them clearly revealed that the DETA inhibitor
was the most efficient one in the environments of EGBs with the inhibitory
efficiency of up to 98%.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Dynamic Test
In the apparatus with
the fuel circulation for dynamic testing (see Figure 1), the contaminated fuels without inhibitors
were tested. The obtained results were used as the reference data
for the calculation of the efficiency of the corrosion inhibitors.
The experiments without the inhibitors were performed for the same
time as the experiments with the inhibitors. The stabilization of
the (corrosion) weight losses and the corrosion rates of mild steel
in time is presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Time dependence of the weight losses related to the sample area
(left) and the corrosion rate of mild steel (right) in the contaminated
E10 (red), E25 (gray), E60 (green), and E85 (blue) fuels without the
inhibitors.

The lowest weight losses
for mild steel were observed for the E10
fuel (see Figure 1).
Conversely, the highest weight losses were observed for the E60 fuel—especially
for the first 96 h. With the increasing time, the weight loss of mild
steel in the E60 fuel gradually stabilized, and only small weight
changes were observed. The contaminated E60 fuel showed the highest
aggressiveness to mild steel in comparison with the other fuels tested.
This is very well in accordance with the findings presented in our
previous publications.50,51 The testing period of 340 hours
was found to be sufficient enough to achieve a metal–fuel balance.

The efficiency of the individual inhibitors in the environment
of the E10, E25, E60, and E85 fuels is evident from the course of
the time dependences of the weight losses of mild steel presented
in Figure 2 and Table 1. In all the fuels
tested, the high efficiency of the DETA inhibitor was clearly demonstrated.
In the presence of the DETA inhibitor, no significant weight losses
of mild steel were observed during the entire test (see Figure 2). A slight weight loss of
mild steel was observed only after the pickling of the surface of
the mild steel, as evidenced by the results of the corrosion rates
(see Table 1). However,
the corrosion rate observed did not exceed the value of 3 μm·year–1. This value was neither exceeded in the most aggressive
E60 fuel, for which the DETA inhibitor showed an efficiency higher
than 98.9%. Very surprisingly, the inhibitor efficiency increased
with the increasing aggressiveness of the fuels, as demonstrated in Table 1.

E85	57.2	34.2	40.2	17.4	69.6	1.4	97.6	
The MIs (MI 1 and MI 2) exhibited a mild effect on the reduction
of the corrosion aggressiveness for the E10 fuel, for which a gradual
increase in the weight loss of mild steel was observed. For the contaminated
E25 fuel, the effect of the MIs was like that for the E10 fuel, but
(unlike the E10 fuel) the measurable corrosion rate was already recorded
after 48 h and the corrosion rate stabilized at values of 2 orders
of magnitude higher. According to the weight losses, the MI 2 inhibitor
seems to have an efficiency of about 88.3%. Because of the high aggressiveness
of the contaminated E60 fuel (twice as much as for E25), the MI 1
inhibitor was found to be practically ineffective. The MI 2 inhibitor
exhibited an efficiency of the corrosion inhibition of mild steel
in the E60 fuel of about 80%. The contaminated E85 fuel had a noticeably
lower aggressiveness in comparison with the E25 and E60 fuels. The
efficiency of the MI 1 inhibitor in the E85 fuel was comparable with
that of the E25 fuel. Despite this, it was demonstrated that the MI
1 inhibitor was not as effective to be applicable for real EGBs and
its efficiency decreased with an increasing fuel aggressiveness. Very
good results were achieved for the MI 2 inhibitor in the E25 and E60
fuels. This inhibitor contains octadecyl amine that can increase the
inhibitor efficiency by its alkalizing ability, that is, it can neutralize
undesirable acidic substances. Satisfactory results were achieved
for the MI 2 inhibitor in the E10 and E85 fuels. For these fuels,
this inhibitor could be suitable because of their considerably lower
aggressiveness.

The corrosion effects of the tested fuels were
also confirmed by
the comparison of the surfaces of mild steel from the experiments
with and without the inhibitors (see Figure 3. For the surfaces of mild steel from the
experiments without the inhibitors, we observed substantial defects
caused by pitting and surface corrosion and their combination depending
on the ethanol content in the EGBs used. This is because with the
increasing ethanol content in the fuels, the fuels can absorb higher
amounts of water with ions that increase the corrosion aggressiveness.

Figure 3 Detailed
pictures of the steel samples after the dynamic test in
the individual fuels with and without the inhibitors, zoomed-in 6.3
times.

When comparing the surface of
mild steel in the environment of
the fuels with and without the inhibitors, the least changes were
observed for the MI 1 inhibitor. This inhibitor did not exhibit any
significant anticorrosive effects, and the appearance of the mild
steel surface did not differ significantly in comparison with the
experiment with no inhibitor. In case of the MI 2 inhibitor containing
octadecyl amine with alkalizing effects, significant anticorrosive
effects were observed, and the surface of mild steel after the corrosion
experiments differed significantly in comparison with the experiment
with no inhibitor. For the experiment with this inhibitor in the contaminated
E60 fuel, for instance, much less extensive pitting corrosion was
observed than for the MI 1 experiment or the no inhibitor experiment
(see Figure 3). For
the DETA inhibitor, the appearance of the mild steel surface did not
change in comparison with the no inhibitor experiment, that is, this
inhibitor exhibited the most significant anticorrosive effects in
comparison with the MIs.

2.2 Static Test
During
the static tests,
the metal–fuel balance was achieved at different times, but
in all the cases before the test finished (i.e., before 890 h), when
the corrosion rate increase was significantly slowed down. This indicates
that the test period of 890 h was sufficient enough for the static
test (see Figure 4.
In this figure, the E10 fuel was not included, as no weight loss of
mild steel was observed during the test. Also, the dependence of the
weight losses and corrosion rates for the experiments with the DETA
inhibitor is not presented in the figure, as no weight losses were
observed. The resulting corrosion rates after pickling and the calculated
corrosion efficiencies of the inhibitors are presented in Table 2.

weight losses related to the sample area
of mild steel during the static test of the contaminated fuels with
and without the inhibitors. Green: no inhibitor. Blue: MI 1. Gray:
MI 2. (For the experiment with the DETA inhibitor, no weight losses
were observed).

E60	34.6	26.7	22.8	8.7	74.9	0.6	98.3	
E85	25.1	14.7	41.4	12.2	51.4	0.4	98.4	
In the contaminated E25 fuel, it was discovered that the anticorrosive
effect of the MI 1 inhibitor was much worse in comparison with the
MI 2 inhibitor, for which an efficiency of 78% was observed. A comparable
result was observed for the contaminated E60 and E10 fuels also. For
the E10 fuel, it was only possible to calculate the corrosion rate
and efficiency after pickling in Chelaton III.

For the MI 2
inhibitor, it was not possible to measure the weight
losses of mild steel in the E85 fuel during the static test, despite
the fact that significant surface changes occurred. The surface of
mild steel was covered by a layer of corrosion products of such an
oxide structure that partially protected the metal and avoided further
corrosion progress. Despite this, a significant weight loss was observed
after the test and pickling in Chelaton III. The efficiency of both
MIs was similar for the E85 fuel (see Table 2). For the first 48 h, an initial very slow
increase in the corrosion rate was observed for the E85 fuel in the
experiments with no inhibitor with the MI 1; then, the corrosion rate
sharply increased up to 264 h of the test. This effect could be caused
by the initial passivation of mild steel and by a gradual progress
of corrosion as a result of an increasing concentration of the released
corrosion products that can inhibit the metal fuel balance and catalyze
the corrosion processes. Such a catalytic effect was not observed
for the MI 2 inhibitor containing octadecyl amine. From the comparison
of the curves of the time dependences of the weight losses in the
tested fuels, it follows that the highest weight losses and corrosion
rates were again observed for the E60 fuel (see Table 2). The efficiencies of the used inhibitors
were similar to that of the dynamic test. The DETA inhibitor in the
environment of the EGBs showed, similar to the dynamic test, efficiencies
higher than 98%. Therefore, it is possible to state that the trends
observed in the dynamic and static tests were similar. The differences
were mainly observed in the absolute values of the weight losses and
corrosion rates. For the static test, these values were significantly
lower as the metal–fuel systems are much less loaded than those
during the dynamic test.

The corrosion aggressiveness of the
tested fuels is demonstrated
by the comparison of the surfaces of mild steel also (see Figure 5. During the test,
no weight losses were observed for the E10 fuel, but a visual evaluation
of the surface of mild steel revealed a mild pitting corrosion. The
visual evaluation also revealed a moderate positive effect of the
MI 1 inhibitor. Despite this, a strong pitting corrosion was observed
for the E25 and E60 fuels. The high efficiency of the DETA inhibitor
is demonstrated by the surface of the mild steel tested in the E60
fuel, where the steel retained a clean surface with a bright metallic
gloss throughout the entire experiment.

the selected steel samples after the static
test in the individual fuels with and without the inhibitors, zoomed

2.3 Electrochemical
Methods—Testing of
the DETA Inhibitor
All the impedance spectra of mild steel
measured in the contaminated E60 and E85 fuels were formed by a high-frequency
and a low-frequency part that were clearly separated (see Figures 7 and 8). From the impedance spectra, it was possible (using an equivalent
circuit; see Figure 6) to evaluate the information about the environment (resistivity
and permittivity) as well as the corrosion data (the polarization
resistance and capacitance of the electrical double layer). The response
of the environment had an ideal capacitance character. Conversely,
the phase interface response was modeled by a constant phase element
(CPE) denoted as Qdl in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Equivalent circuit used
for the impedance data analysis. R1, R2 and C1, C2: bulk and
reference electrode bridge resistance and capacitance, respectively; Rp: polarization resistance; Qdl: CPE describing the double-layer response.

All the evaluated spectral parameters (impedance
and polarization
characteristics) are presented in Tables 3 and 4. During the
measurement, it was determined that the shape of the high-frequency
part of the spectra was dependent on the type of the reference electrode
used. When a pseudoreference platinum electrode was used, the impedance
response at high frequencies was always formed by one capacitance
loop starting from the beginning of the coordinate axis in a complex
plane. The loop was very well approximated by the impedance of a parallel
combination of resistance and capacitance. When a silver chloride
electrode with a salt bridge was used, two capacitance loops appeared
in some cases (see Figure 7 and Table 4). This is a combination of the spatial impedance (the
resistivity and capacitance of the environment) and the response associated
with the impedance of the reference electrode surface, especially
the porous frit of the bridge.

steel electrode in the

Figure 7 compares
the spectra in the environment of the contaminated fuels without the
DETA inhibitor. A smaller radius of a half circle of the low-frequency
spectrum part for the E60 fuel is evident in this figure. The smaller
radius corresponds to the evaluated lower value of the polarization
resistance in Table 3. Almost 2 times the higher value of the polarization resistance
observed in the E85 fuel corresponds to the lower corrosion rate of
mild steel. The contaminated E60 fuel without the inhibitor showed
a higher corrosion aggressiveness in comparison with the E85 fuel.

Unlike the fuels without the inhibitors, enormously high polarization
resistances (see Table 4 and Figure 8 were observed for the fuels containing the
DETA inhibitor. These high values demonstrate the high ability of
DETA to inhibit the corrosion of mild steel in the EGBs. The intensity
of the inhibition was significant, especially in the E60 fuel. As
it can be seen in Table 3, the value of polarization resistance in this environment was about
5 times higher than that for the E85 fuel. Also, a significant decrease
of the capacitance of the double layer in the E60 fuel is clearly
related to the higher adsorption of the DETA inhibitor on the surface
of mild steel. From the measured data presented in Table 3, an increasing inhibitory activity
of DETA with an increasing fuel aggressiveness is evident.

Figure 8 Nyquist plot
of the impedance of a mild steel electrode in the
simulated E85 and E60 environment with 100 ppm of DETA added. In the
embedded graph, the high-frequency part of the impedance spectra is
enlarged.

The values of n presented in Table 3 are the important parameters
describing the properties on the steel–electrolyte interface.
The n values lower than 1 (n <
1) represent the deviation of the measured capacity from the ideal
capacity (n = 1) that is presented as the effective
capacity Ceff in Table 3. This deviation is associated with the inhomogeneity
on the electrode surface or with the steel surface roughness. In general,
the deviation of the measured capacity from the ideal value (capacity)
increases with the decreasing n values. In the Nyquist
diagram, this fact can be exhibited by the shifting of the semicircle.44,52,53 As a result of the high serial
resistance Rs (high-frequency response)
that is associated with the low conductivity of an environment and
the geometric arrangement of a measuring cell, it was necessary to
calculate the Ceff values from eq 1, where Rs is the serial resistance, Qdl is the double-layer response, and Rp is the polarization resistance. 1  

The Tafel
curves measured on mild steel in the tested fuels with
and without DETA are compared in Figures 9 and 10. From the
evaluated polarization characteristics presented in Table 4, the current densities were
calculated according to the Stern–Geary equation. From the
obtained current densities, the efficiency of the DETA inhibitor was
determined for the E60 and E85 fuels.

Figure 9 Potentiodynamic polarization curves of
mild steel in the E85 fuel
with no inhibitor and in the E85 fuel with 100 mg·L–1 of DETA.

Figure 10 Potentiodynamic polarization curves of
mild steel in the E60 fuel
with no inhibitor and in the E60 fuel with 100 mg·L–1 of DETA.

For both fuels, the
DETA inhibitor caused a substantial shift in
the corrosion potentials toward positive values, and the corrosion
current densities were also decreased. The shift in the corrosion
potentials and the decrease in the corrosion current densities indicate
that DETA acts as an anodic inhibitor that actively helps to effectively
suppress the anodic partial corrosion process in the EGBs. Considering
an overall moderate decrease in the polarization curves into lower
current densities, it can be concluded that the adsorbed inhibitor
influences the cathodic reaction (predominantly a reduction in the
dissolved oxygen) also.

As shown in Table 5, the DETA inhibitor also has a strong alkalizing
ability, which
is already exhibited at a concentration of 100 mg·L–1 by a pH increase. The inhibitor, by its alkalizing ability, initially
neutralizes acidic substances that can act corrosively to mild steel.
The alkalizing ability of DETA is associated with a decrease in the
corrosion potential. Despite this, such a decrease was not observed,
as the shift toward positive values was predominant.

and E85 Fuels before and after the Additivation with DETA
fuel	no additives	with additives	
E60	7.09	9.85	
E85	6.76	9.72	
The measured
polarization data also demonstrate the higher efficiency
of DETA in the E60 fuel, in which a higher increase in the corrosion
potential (up to 0.39 V) and 1 order of magnitude decrease in the
current density were observed in comparison with the E85 fuel. In
the E60 fuel, the efficiency of the DETA inhibitor was measured and
calculated to be 99.8%. This result agrees with the results of the
static and the dynamic tests.

3 Conclusions
In this study, we have presented the testing of the efficiency
of three corrosion inhibitors on mild steel in an environment of aggressive
EGBs that were contaminated by water and trace amounts of sulfates
and chlorides. The aggressiveness of the E10, E25, and E60 fuels increased
with the ethanol content, that is, the E60 fuel was the most aggressive
environment for mild steel. The aggressiveness of the E85 fuel was
lower than that of the E25 fuel. The MI 1 inhibitor containing propargyl alcohol and dibenzyl sulfoxide (originally
designed for corrosion inhibition for the transportation, storage,
and processing of crude oils) was found not to be sufficiently efficient
to be applied for real EGBs. In the concentration in which the MI
1 inhibitor was applied in this study, its efficiency decreased with
the increasing aggressiveness of the EGBs applied. For the E60 fuel
in the dynamic test, the efficiency of this inhibitor was about 16%.
The highest efficiencies (∼40%) of this inhibitor were recorded
for the E25 and E80 fuels. The MI 2 inhibitor containing
propargyl alcohol, mercaptobenzothiazole, and octadecyl amine gave
acceptable inhibition efficiencies for the E25 and E60 fuels. Satisfactory
results of this inhibitor were observed for the E85 fuel also. In
the static and dynamic tests, the efficiency of the MI 2 inhibitor
in the E60 fuel was about 75–80%. The DETA inhibitor was found to be the most efficient among all the inhibitors tested.
Its efficiency was about 96–99% depending on the content of
ethanol in the EGBs tested. For this inhibitor, an increasing efficiency
was observed with the increasing fuel aggressiveness, that is, the
highest efficiency was observed for the E60 fuel. The efficiency of
this inhibitor was proven by the electrochemical methods also. The
efficiency determined by the electrochemical methods was about 99.8%.
The polarization measurements revealed that this inhibitor had characteristics
of an anodic inhibitor with a high adsorption ability that was proven
by the results of impedance spectroscopy also. By the pH measurements,
the alkalizing ability of the DETA inhibitor was demonstrated. The
measurements proved the DETA inhibitor to be a sufficient corrosion
inhibitor for mild steel in the real EGBs. For all the inhibitors
tested, the static and dynamic tests showed good results that correlated
well with each other. These results suitably complemented the data
obtained using electrochemical methods.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Preparation of Contaminated EGBs
Contaminated EGBs were prepared from (i) a gasoline base and (ii)
fermented, absolutized ethanol (≥99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich, p.a.)
with water content up to 650 mg·kg–1. The gasoline
base was prepared from five different petroleum fractions: reformate,
isomerate, and FCC gasolines (light, middle, and heavy). The petroleum
fractions were mixed in such a volume ratio that the contents of the
saturated, unsaturated, and aromatic hydrocarbons met the requirements
of the ČSN EN 228 standard. The group-type composition of the
gasoline base (53.9 vol % of the saturated, 10.6 vol % of the unsaturated,
and 35.5 vol % of the aromatic hydrocarbons) was verified by gas chromatography.50,51

To increase their aggressiveness, the EGBs were purposely
contaminated by a solution containing sodium chloride (99.9%), sodium
sulfate anhydrous (99%), 96% sulfuric acid, and 100% acetic acid (all
p.a. chemicals purchased from Penta Chemicals, the Czech Republic).
The solution was added into the EGBs in an amount of 0.5 vol % so
that the resulting fuel contained (after adding demineralized water
to the desired amount) 3 mg·L–1 of sodium chloride,
2.5 mg·L–1 of sodium sulfate, 2.5 mg·L–1 of sulfuric acid, and 47.8 mg·L–1 of acetic acid. The desired water content in the model contaminated
EGBs was 0.5 vol % for the E10 fuel, 1.75 vol % for the E25 fuel,
and 6 vol % for the E60 and E85 fuels.

4.1.1 Corrosion
Inhibitors
Three different
inhibitors were tested, and all of them were added into each of the
prepared EGBs (see Table 6. The first two (mixed) inhibitors were originally designed
as corrosion inhibitors for the transportation, storage, and processing
of crude oils. DETA, which was supposed to be a promising corrosion
inhibitor for mild steel, was the third inhibitor.

Table 6 Tested Inhibitors and Their Concentrations

 	inhibitors	manufacturer, purity	amount (mg·L–1)	
MI 1	propargyl alcohol	Sigma-Aldrich, p.a. 99%	100	
 	dibenzyl sulfoxide	Merck Millipore, p.a.	65

As the
MIs contain sulfur-containing compounds (dibenzyl sulfoxide
with 14 wt % of sulfur and the sodium salt of mercaptobenzothiazole,
with 35 wt % of sulfur), their concentration in the fuels was chosen
such that the sulfur content met the requirements of the ČSN
EN 228 standard (<10 mg·kg–1). The resulting
sulfur content after additivation by the inhibitors was verified according
to ASTM D 5453 using the elemental analyzer Mitsubishi TS 100/TN (Cosa
Instrument Corporation, USA). The sulfur content after the additivation
was measured for the E60 fuel only, and the obtained values were as
follows: 9.4 and 8.5 mg·kg–1 for the MI 1 and
the MI 2 inhibitor, respectively.

4.2 Metallic
Materials for Corrosion Studies
Corrosion studies were performed
on carbon steel 11375 (in this
manuscript, designated as “mild steel”) containing 0.16
wt % of carbon, 0.032 wt % of phosphorus, and 0.028 wt % of sulfur.
From a 1 mm thick steel sheet, 10 × 40 mm plates were prepared.
For the electrochemical measurements, a cylindrical electrode with
a surface area of 2.6 cm2 was prepared from mild steel.
Prior to the experiment, the steel surface was adjusted by grinding
using sandpaper (1200 mesh) and polishing under running water so that
the surface was adjusted evenly. Then, the sample surface was degreased
with acetone and ethanol and then dried freely or using a pulp tissue.56

4.3 Testing of the Corrosion
Inhibitors
Several tests were applied to study the corrosion
inhibitors including
a dynamic test, a static test, and electrochemical measurements. These
tests are briefly described in the following subsections. They are
all described in deep detail elsewhere.56

4.3.1 Dynamic Test
The apparatus with
the fuel circulation for the dynamic test is presented in Figure 11. Although the
apparatus is more complicated in comparison with the apparatus for
the static test, this is compensated by much shorter testing periods,
as the testing is performed with circulating fuel during the thermal
stress. This testing method is suitable for several applications including
(i) the fast prediction of fuel aging, (ii) testing the changes in
fuel quality, and (iii) testing the fuel influence on metallic and
nonmetallic materials.56

flow apparatus for dynamic testing: (1)

(4) air inlet, (5) sample hook, (6) overflow into the storage flask,
(7) storage flask, (8) cooler, (9) cryostat, (10) peristaltic pump,
(11) thermometer. Adapted with permission from ref (56). Copyright 2018 MyJove
Corporation.

The main part of the
apparatus is the tempered flask in which a
direct contact between the tested fuel and the sample hung on a hook
occurs. The reservoir of the tested fuel is equipped by a reflux cooler
that ensures the connection of the entire apparatus to the atmosphere.
Also, the cooler is used to freeze the volatile compounds (at −40
°C) to avoid possible fuel losses. The fuel circulation in a
closed circuit (made from chemically resistant, inert material, e.g.,
Teflon, Viton, Tygon, etc.) is ensured by a peristaltic pump that
transfers the fuel from the storage flask back to the tempered flask.

In the apparatus, 400 mL of fuel at a flow rate of 0.5 L·h–1 was tested. The fuel was heated in the tempered part
to 40 °C and bubbled with air at a flow rate of about 20–30
mL·min–1. The testing was performed on two
metallic plates (see Section 4.2) that were removed from the apparatus and weighed
at regular time intervals. Prior to weighing, the surface layer of
the corrosion products was removed using a pulp tissue and the sample
was rinsed with acetone and dried. From the time-dependent weight
losses, the corrosion rate in mm·year–1 (vLr) was calculated according to eqs 2 and 3. 2   3  where vPm is the
corrosion rate in g·m–2·h–1, ρ is the density of the metallic material in g·cm–3, Δm is the average weight
loss in g, S is the surface area of the metallic
material in m2, and t is the time of exposure
(in hours).50

After the test, the
tested samples were pickled in a 10 wt % solution
of disodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). From the
overall weight loss of steel, the ultimate corrosion rate was calculated.

4.3.2 Static Immersion Test
The static
test was designed according to the methods described in the ČSN
03 8452 and ASTM D130-04 standards. This test is based on the exposure
of metallic materials for a certain time in the tested samples (corrosion
environment) at a given ratio between the sample volume and the area
of the metallic material. In our study, the ratio was chosen to be
10 mL of the EGB (corrosion environment) to 1 cm2 of the
metallic material so that the corrosion rate was not stabilized too
soon. The static test was performed as a long-term test at room temperature
without air entrance in a closed 250 mL GL45 bottle that contained
160 mL of the fuel and two metallic plates with a total surface area
of 16 cm2. The metallic samples were removed from the bottle
and weighed at certain time periods. The corrosion rate was calculated
from the obtained weight losses (see Section 4.3.1).56

After the test, the tested samples were pickled in a 10 wt % solution
of disodium EDTA. From the overall weight loss of the steel, the ultimate
corrosion rate was calculated.

4.3.3 Electrochemical
Measurements
Electrochemical
measurements were performed on the FRA Solartron 1250 (Schlumberger,
UK) and potentiostat SI 1287 (Schlumberger, UK) devices at a laboratory
temperature in a three-electrode arrangement in a cell containing
100 mL of fuel.50,51,56 The cell was placed in a Faraday cage. The electrode system consisted
of (i) a working electrode from mild steel, (ii) an auxiliary platinum
electrode, and (iii) a reference silver chloride electrode with a
bridge containing 1 mol·L–1 solution of lithium
chloride in ethanol for measurements in nonaqueous environments. For
long-term measurements, a pseudoreference platinum electrode was used
to avoid environmental contamination by leaking from the bridge of
the reference electrode.

At the beginning of each measurement,
the corrosion potential was measured during its stabilization for
1 h. Then, the electrochemical impedance and polarization characteristics
were measured. The electrochemical impedance was measured at an amplitude
of 5 mV in a frequency range of 60 kHz to 1 mHz. From the electrochemical
impedance spectrum, the environmental resistance (resistivity) and
polarization resistance were evaluated. Polarization curves were measured
in a range of ±300 mV relative to the corrosion potential. Resistivities
determined by EIS were used to obtain the iR drop
from the polarization curves. The evaluation of the linear cathodic
and anodic parts of the polarization curves allowed one to obtain
the Tafel coefficients βa and βc for a given metal–fuel system. The Tafel coefficients, as
well as the polarization resistance Rp, were used for the calculation of the corrosion current density icorr according to the Stern–Geary equation
(see eq 4). 4  

4.3.4 Calculation of the Inhibitor Efficiencies
The effect
is specific, especially in relation to the metal composition,
metal properties, and environment properties. The inhibitor efficiency
can be evaluated according to the following equations (see eqs 5a–5c) 5a   5b   5c  where Ef is the
inhibitor efficiency in %, Rp is the polarization
resistance of the material, and νPm is the corrosion
rate of the material in a metal–fuel system; icorr—see eq 4; the indices i and 0 describe the system with and without
the inhibitor, respectively.56

4.4 Total Acid Number
Total acid number
(TAN) measurements were performed according to IP 177/96 and ASTM
D664-89 on an automatic DMS TITRINO 716 (Metrohm) with a potentiometric
detection of the point of equivalence. The obtained results are presented
in Table 7.

Table 7 TAN of the Prepared Contaminated EGBs

E25 + 2.0% H2O	0.0196	
E60 + 6% H2O	0.0210	
E85 + 6% H2O	0.0312	
4.5 pH Measurement
The pH measurements
were performed on an inoLab pH/Cond Level 1 instrument at a laboratory
temperature. These measurements were performed for the contaminated
E60 and E85 fuels before and after the additivation with the DETA
inhibitor (100 mg·L–1).
