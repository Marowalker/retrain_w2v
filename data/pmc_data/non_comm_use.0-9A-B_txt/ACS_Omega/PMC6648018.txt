The characteristics of copper (Cu)
isotropic dry etching using
a hydrogen-based plasma generated at 13.3 kPa (100 Torr) were improved
dramatically by simply introducing a moderate amount of N2 gas into the process atmosphere. A maximum Cu etch rate of 2.4 μm/min
was obtained by nitrogen addition at a H2 mixture ratio
(CH2) of 0.9 and an input power
of 70 W. The etch rate for the optimally N2-added plasma
was 8 times higher than that for the pure H2 plasma. The
Cu etch rate increased with increasing input power. The maximum etch
rate reached 3.1 μm/min at an input power of 100 W and a CH2 of 0.9. The surface roughness
of the etched copper decreased as a result of optimum N2 addition. Furthermore, N2 addition also improved the
etch selectivity between Cu and SiO2 such that the selectivity
ratio reached 190. Finally, selective etching of a trench-patterned
Si wafer with an electroplated Cu layer was demonstrated.

==== Body
1 Introduction
A precise chemical etching technique for a metal is an essential
manufacturing technology for the fabrication of various devices, including
microelectronic devices, microelectromechanical systems, and optical
devices. Above all, copper (Cu) is a ubiquitous industrial metal because
of its low electrical resistivity and earthly abundance. However,
when Cu microstructures are prepared, the use of harmful chemicals
is necessary in either dry or wet etching. It is well known that Cu
wet etching requires nitric acid, sulfuric acid, or a mixture of hydrochloric
acid and hydrogen peroxide and shows isotropic etching behavior.1 These wet etching techniques are frequently used
for the fabrication of printed circuit boards, and their etching rates
typically attain tens of micrometers per minute.2,3 In
contrast, when dry etching is performed on Cu at a considerably high
rate, chlorine-related gases are used as typical etchant gases for
the Cu metal.4−6 One of the motivations for performing dry etching
processes using chlorine-related gases is to achieve anisotropic etching.7,8 In chlorine-related gas dry etching processes, the gas species that
is mixed into the process atmosphere is also known to strongly affect
both the etch rate and the etch anisotropy.9 On the other hand, Hess et al. revealed that the hydrogen plasma
can etch Cu at relatively low temperatures.10−13 From the viewpoint of avoiding
the use of hazardous chemicals, hydrogen etching appears to be more
attractive than chlorine etching. However, the etch rate that was
obtained using a low-pressure pure hydrogen plasma was 13 nm/min and
a higher rate is desirable for both a wider range of applications
(i.e., other than microelectronic Cu wiring) and higher production
throughput.

We therefore attempted to use a subatmospheric-pressure
pure hydrogen
plasma for Cu isotropic dry etching to achieve higher etching rates
and obtain meaningful etch rates as high as 500 nm/min.14 However, the etched surface became rough because
of the many pits and voids that formed after etching. This surface
roughening was presumed to result from the excess hydrogen content
in the Cu bulk because vast numbers of hydrogen atoms can easily diffuse
into the metal when the Cu surface is exposed to the high-density
H2 plasma. It is also well known that hydrogen atoms tend
to create vacancies in the metal because of the energetic stability
of the vacancy–hydrogen complex,15 so these nonequilibrium vacancies tend to segregate, resulting in
void formation in the Cu bulk.16,17 As a result, the roughness
of the etched surface was considered to originate from these preformed
voids. If the above surface roughening mechanism is accepted, prevention
of atomic H diffusion into the Cu bulk seems to be a possible solution
for surface roughness suppression. In hydrogen-using industries, such
as thermal nuclear fusion and oil production, metal surfaces are often
coated using a low hydrogen permeation layer to prevent hydrogen embrittlement
of the metal.18−20 In the cases of Al and Ti metals,21,22 alumina and titanium oxide exhibit low permeability because of their
low hydrogen diffusivity. In contrast, an iron nitride layer grown
using plasma acts as a hydrogen trapping layer.23 Therefore, if surface-reforming gases, which transform
surfaces from metallic to nonmetallic bonds, are supplied simultaneously
to the plasma during Cu etching, an improvement in etched surface
roughness can be expected because of the suppression of hydrogen diffusion
into the metal. We focused on nitrogen gas as the surface-reforming
gas because N2 is a stable and inexpensive gas and Cu3N is a nonmetallic and covalent material.24

Therefore, in this report, to improve the surface
roughness and
the etch rate in Cu etching using a subatmospheric-pressure hydrogen-based
plasma, we have investigated the effects of addition of N2 to the plasma on the Cu etching properties and have achieved dramatic
improvements in the copper etching properties when using a high-pressure
hydrogen-based plasma.

2 Experimental Section
The experimental setup that was used in this study is shown in Figure 1a. The apparatus
has also been described in detail in a previous report.14 The Cu samples were 1 mm thick rolled Cu plates
with a purity of 99.9%. Additionally, 0.7 mm thick SiO2 glass was used to evaluate the etch selectivity. Trench-patterned
wafers with electroplated Cu layers were also used to verify the feasibility
of the process as a Cu wiring process. The samples were mounted on
a Cu stage, and the stage temperature was maintained at 0 °C
by circulating a coolant. The sample stage was grounded, so the Cu
sample bias was 0 V. An In–Ga alloy was pasted on the bottom
sample surface to improve the thermal conductivity between the stage
and the sample. After loading the sample on the stage, the etch chamber
was evacuated to a pressure of less than 10–3 Pa.
Then, a N2 and H2 gas mixture was introduced
into the chamber at a total pressure of 13.3 kPa (100 Torr). To provide
insight into the role of nitrogen addition, Ar and He were also used
as alternative additive gases in place of N2. The hydrogen
mixture ratio (CH2) of the
process gas was adjusted using mass flow controllers. The process
gases were supplied directly to the plasma at a total flow rate of
10 standard liters per minute (SLM) through the pipe electrode, and
the process chamber pressure was maintained at 13.3 kPa during the
experiments by adjusting the exhaust conductance. The plasma gap between
the pipe electrode and the sample was set at 0.7 mm. In this etching
system, the Cu etch rate is also dependent on this plasma gap value
and the etch rate generally decreases as the gap value increases.
Very high frequency (VHF; 150 MHz) plasma input power (WVHF) was supplied to the plasma gap through an impedance
matching unit without any blocking capacitors to generate the plasma,
and this power was varied as an experimental parameter. The VHF driving
frequency was selected to generate a more localized high-density plasma
around the apex of the pipe electrode when compared to that generated
using a radio frequency (RF) source. Figure 1b,c shows photographs of the H2-based plasmas generated at hydrogen mixture ratios of 1 and 0.9,
respectively. The images show that the optical emission intensity
around the apex of the pipe electrode is stronger than that in any
other region in the setup. However, all aspects of the two plasmas
seem to be almost identical, regardless of the hydrogen mixture ratio.
The surface profile of the etched sample was obtained using a stylus
surface profiler (Tokyo Seimitsu, Surfcom 590A). As mentioned in our
previous report,14 because the etching
depth shows a distribution along the radial direction of the electrode,
the etch rate (Retch) was calculated from
the etched valley depth obtained and the etching time. The surface
morphology of the sample was observed using a scanning electron microscope
(SEM; Hitachi, S-4800). The surface roughness of the sample was evaluated
using a laser scanning microscope (Keyence, VK-9710). Additionally,
an optical emission diagnosis of the plasma was conducted using an
optical spectrometer (Ocean Optics, HR-4000CG-UV-NIR).

experimental setup used in the study. (b),
(c) Aspects of the pure hydrogen plasma and the 1 SLM N2-added plasma, respectively. Each plasma was generated at a VHF input
power of 100 W, a process pressure of 13.3 kPa, and a total gas flow
rate of 10 SLM.

3 Results
and Discussion
Figure 2 shows the
effect of the addition of nitrogen on the etch rate (Retch) obtained at an input power (WVHF) of 70 W. The etching time was kept at 20 min. In Figure 2, the etch rates
obtained for the He and Ar dilutions are also shown for a comparison
of the additive gas effects. As shown in Figure 2, for the N2 gas addition, Cu
etching was hardly observed when CH2 was less than 0.1 and Retch increased
with increasing CH2 until CH2 increased to 0.9. However, Retch decreased with increasing CH2 above a value of 0.9 and Retch reduced to 0.3 μm/min at a CH2 of 1. The maximum Retch achieved by the nitrogen-added plasma was 2.4 μm/min
at a CH2 of 0.9. From this
result, Retch was increased 8-fold by
the addition of 1 SLM of N2 gas when compared to that of
pure H2 plasma. On the other hand, for the He-added plasma,
the etch rates were reduced by He gas addition when compared to that
of the pure H2 plasma and did not show any remarkable CH2 dependence. Similarly, for the
Ar-added plasma, the etch rates were almost the same as that of the pure H2 plasma and were
independent of CH2. In the
pure hydrogen plasma used in this study, H3+ and H+ seem to be the main ion species because H2+ ions react promptly with H2 molecules
to form stable H3+ ions because of the short
mean free path of the high-pressure process.25 Although Ar is heavier than H2+, H3+, and N2+, addition of Ar did not
affect the Cu etch rate at all. Therefore, physical sputtering by
ions does not seem to be the sole cause of copper etching. A typical
photograph of a Cu sample that was etched by the pure H2 plasma is shown in the inset of Figure 2. To indicate the positional relationship
between the plasma electrode and the Cu sample, a schematic of the
area around the electrode is also shown. Etching does not occur beneath
the electrode central hole, and the maximum etched depth could be
obtained beneath the electrode wall. Furthermore, a discolored area
can be observed outside the plasma. This is caused by redeposition
of a portion of the Cu etching product because the process gas was
blown out of the central hole in the pipe electrode in this study.
Therefore, if this redeposition is to be avoided, suction should be
used to remove the process gas from the central hole.

Figure 2 Etch rate (Retch) dependence on hydrogen
mixture ratio relative to the total mass flow (CH2). The dilution gases are N2 (circles),
Ar (triangles), and He (squares). Insets show schematics of the positional
relationship between the plasma and the etched sample and the aspect
of Cu sample etched by the pure H2 plasma at a total gas
flow rate of 10 SLM. The dotted lines in the inset indicate the boundary
between the plasma-exposed region and the unexposed region. The dashed
lines indicate the inner wall position of the pipe-type electrode.
Because of redeposition of the etch products, the copper surface outside
the plasma is discolored.

Magnified photographs of the Cu samples that were etched
by the
nitrogen-added plasma at CH2 values of 1 and 0.9 are shown in Figure 3a,b, respectively. Figure 3d,e shows surface SEM images of the Cu samples
when etched at CH2 values of
1 and 0.9, respectively. Additionally, a photograph and a surface
SEM image of the as-received Cu sample are shown in Figure 3c,f, respectively. The as-received
Cu sample shows fine scratches occurring in the same direction on
its surface due to the rolling process. This roll mark can be observed
in the SEM image shown in Figure 3f. As shown in Figure 3a,b, the appearances of the etched Cu samples clearly
differed from each other. When the pure H2 plasma was used,
the surface around the arrow, which indicated the deepest position
of the etched valley, showed no gloss and was rough. In contrast,
when using the 10% N2-added plasma, the etched surface
area was shiner than that obtained using the pure H2 plasma.
These differences among the appearance of the samples originated from
the microscopic surface structure of the etched sample, as shown in Figure 3d,e. The roll mark
existed on the as-received Cu sample vanished from both etched surfaces.
When the pure H2 plasma was used, many bumps and voids
with approximate diameters of a few hundred nanometers were observed
on the surface. In contrast, when the 10% N2-added plasma
was used, the surface morphology became smoother and the void density
decreased drastically, although a few bumps and voids were still observed.
Moreover, the contrast, which was caused by the different crystalline
grain orientation, could be observed (see the arrows in Figure 3e). The surface roughness values
(130 × 130 μm2) measured by a laser microscope
were Ra = 0.29 μm and Ra = 0.06 μm for the pure H2 plasma and
the 10% N2-added plasma, respectively. N2 addition
to the hydrogen plasma thus revealed improvements in both the Cu etch
rate and the etched surface roughness.

Figure 4a
shows
a photograph of the pure H2 plasma generated at a plasma
gap of 1 mm and an input power of 100 W. The H2 pressure
and H2 flow rate are 100 Torr and 10 SLM, respectively. Figure 4a shows that the
plasma optical emission region exists near the two electrode surfaces.
Moreover, a relatively dark region when compared with the bright region
near the electrodes can be observed around the center of the plasma
gap. This spatial emission distribution of the plasma becomes much
more obvious in Figure 4b. Figure 4b shows
a photograph of the plasma when observed through an optical filter
at a wavelength of 656 nm, which corresponds with the Balmer α
line for atomic hydrogen (Hα). As shown in Figure 4b, the intensity
saturation region in the photograph indicates that the high-density
atomic hydrogen is generated at the apex of the electrode and below
the electrode wall. It is also confirmed that the luminous region
is distributed around the surfaces of the two electrodes. When compared
with the luminous region around the electrode surface, hydrogen generation
is not as remarkable as around the center of the gap. The arc column
connecting the electrode to the sample and the spark are not observed
in the plasma gap. This spatial distribution in the plasma luminous
region indicates that the plasma is sustained in the γ-mode,
which is largely dominated by secondary electron emission from the
metal electrode.26

Figure 4 (a) Photograph of the
pure H2 plasma generated at a
plasma gap of 1 mm and an input power of 100 W. The H2 pressure
and H2 flow rate were 100 Torr and 10 SLM, respectively.
(b) Photograph of the plasma in (a) observed through an optical filter
at a wavelength of 656 nm, which corresponds to the Balmer α
line of atomic hydrogen (Hα). (c) Optical emission
spectra (OES) of the hydrogen-based plasma. Plasma was generated under
the same experimental conditions used in Figure 2. The emission from the plasma was collected
using an ultraviolet transmitting optical fiber that was attached
2 cm away from the plasma.

Figure 4c
shows
the optical emission spectra (OES) of the various plasmas during Cu
etching. With the exception of the pure N2 plasma, Hα could be observed at the wavelength of 656.6 nm but
the Balmer β line (Hβ) at 486 nm was barely
visible. The hydrogen line ratios (Hβ/Hα) between Hα and Hβ that were obtained
at various N2 mixture ratios are remarkably lower than
that of the methane-containing low-pressure hydrogen plasma at 20
mTorr.27 Because the average electron energy
is reported to range from 2.5 to 3.0 eV in that low-pressure hydrogen
plasma, the electron energy of the plasma in this study is estimated
to be much lower than 2.5 eV. This reduction in the electron energy
is related to the high process pressure and the use of the VHF plasma
driving frequency, which is higher than RF.28 Moreover, since no etching was observed without H2 gas,
the presence of atomic hydrogen was thus of primary importance to
the copper dry etching process. However, the Hα emission
intensity of the pure hydrogen plasma was slightly higher than that
of the 10% N2-added plasma, although the etch rate of the
10% N2-added plasma was 6 times higher than that of the
pure hydrogen plasma. This result indicates that the increase in the
Cu etching rate by N2 addition is not due to the increased
atomic hydrogen density of the 10% N2-added plasma but
is caused by other mechanisms. In contrast, the OES of the N2-added plasma showed that broad emission bands from the excited nitrogen
molecules were observed in the wavelength range from 300 to 400 nm
(second positive system) and in the range from 550 to 800 nm (first
positive system).29,30 Emission from N2+ was also observed at 391.3 nm, and its emission intensity
relative to the other nitrogen-related emissions increased with increasing CH2 from 0 to 0.9. Although an emission
from an NH radical appears at 337 nm, this band was overlapped by
the N2 second positive system and the two emissions were
unable to be separated. However, in this H2 and N2 gas mixture plasma, it was confirmed by gas-phase Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy that ammonia was produced (data not shown).
Ammonia production in the plasma usually required a NH radical as
an intermediate product,31 and NH radicals
were typically generated via the following reaction processes.32−34 1   2   3  From
the above equations, NH radical formation
requires N2+ or an N atom in addition to an
H atom. Then, the NH radical can be produced in the plasma and contributes
to the nitridation of the copper surface. With regard to Cu, though
strong emission lines could be observed at 324.8, 327.4, and 521.8
nm, a more remarkable emission comparable to that from the H atom
was not observed. This lack of emission from the Cu atoms could be
explained in two ways: either most of the etched Cu evaporated in
the form of copper compounds, such as copper hydride, or the emission
from the Cu atoms was diminished because of quenching by H2 molecules.

Figure 5 shows the WVHF dependence of Retch that was obtained at a CH2 of 0.9. The Cu etch rates obtained by the
pure H2 plasma
are also shown in Figure 5. Retch increased linearly as WVHF increased from 40 to 100 W. The sample temperature
near the surface also increased by plasma heating as WVHF increased. In particular, for the pure H2 plasma, it was estimated that the temperature near the sample surface
increased from 50 to 250 °C as WVHF increased from 40 to 100 W based on ultrafine diameter (φ
= 80 μm) sheath thermocouple measurements, although the Cu sample
was chilled from its bottom surface by the Cu stage at 0 °C. Retch reached 3.1 μm/min at 100 W. In comparison
with the rates for the pure H2 plasma, all etch rates obtained
were dramatically improved by the addition of N2. Similar
to the etching behavior of the N2-added plasma, Retch for the pure H2 plasma increased
linearly with increasing WVHF. However,
the gradient between Retch and WVHF became larger for the N2-added
plasma when compared to that for the pure H2 plasma. This
different gradient implied that the generation of nitriding species
and nitridation of the Cu surface occurred as a renewed rate-limiting
process for Cu etching with N2 addition. In addition, Figure 5 also shows Retch for SiO2 when using the N2-added plasma at 100 W. The Retch obtained was 16.4 nm/min, which was lower than that for the pure
hydrogen plasma, because the Retch for
SiO2 by the pure H2 plasma was 45 nm/min. The
etching rate ratio between SiO2 and Cu was 190 for the
10% N2-added plasma. If this dry etching process is applied
to copper removal on the patterned SiO2 layer, then greater
selectivity is desirable. Because the selectivity between SiO2 and Cu for the pure hydrogen plasma was 11,14 N2 addition also has an effect on improving
the material selectivity. Furthermore, if N2 addition simply
contributed to the increase of atomic hydrogen density caused by an
increase in the plasma density, Retch for
SiO2 would also increase. However, Retch for SiO2 decreased with the addition of N2, so nitridation of the solid surface seems to affect the
etching behavior strongly. The proposed etching model is shown in Figure 6. In the case where
nitrogen is added to the process atmosphere, a thin nitride layer
would be formed by nitrogen radicals. If stoichiometric Cu3N is formed as this nitride layer, the bond lengths of Cu–Cu
in metallic Cu and Cu–N in Cu3N would be 2.56 and
1.91 Å, respectively.35 Therefore,
the Cu3N structure is denser than that of metallic copper
and the nitride layer would act as a barrier layer for reactive radicals
because its structure is denser than that of metallic Cu. This barrier
effect is expected to be effective for both the nitriding species
and atomic hydrogen. Therefore, the formation of a thick nitride layer
and diffusion of excess hydrogen into the metal would be inhibited.
Suppression of the excess hydrogen diffusion into the metal leads
to the inhibition of excess void formation in the Cu bulk, as shown
in Figure 6b. Furthermore,
Cu3N appears to be a covalent compound,36 which means that the defective nitride layer will contain
multiple dangling bonds. Therefore, a lot of atomic hydrogen would
be accumulated in the nitride layer due to dense nitride structure
and trapping by the dangling bonds. In contrast, it was reported that
pyrolysis of Cu3N becomes remarkable in a vacuum atmosphere
when the sample temperature exceeds 350 °C.37 Cu3N does not seem as thermodynamically stable
as other nitrides, e.g., AlN and Si3N4. It is
thus expected that copper nitride will react easily with atomic hydrogen.
If a thin Cu3N layer covered the Cu surface, Cu hydride
was proposed to be formed via the following reaction 4  The formation enthalpies for Cu3N, H, and
CuH are known to be 74.5,38 472,
and 27.5 kJ/mol,39 respectively. Although
the entropies for Cu3N and CuH are unfortunately unknown,
given that the entropies for Cu3N and CuH are equal to
that for CuO, the reaction in eq 4 would be possible below 1000 °C in the presence of atomic
hydrogen. Therefore, hydrogen atom accumulation in the nitride layer
appears to enhance the reaction between Cu and H while suppressing
void formation in the Cu bulk, unlike pure hydrogen plasma. Choi et
al. reported that Cu can be etched using a low-pressure pure methane
plasma at higher etch rates than a low-pressure pure hydrogen plasma.27 In their report, it was estimated that the etch
products were changed from unstable CuH species to relatively stable
CH3Cu or CH3CuH– species by
changing the process atmosphere from pure H2 to pure CH4. In contrast, in this study, copper etching did not occur
under the pure N2 plasma. The copper etching only proceeded
when the process atmosphere contained hydrogen gas. Therefore, copper
etching appears to be proceeded by copper hydride formation. It was
also reported that CuH shows relatively low vapor pressure.40 Ion bombardment may thus enhance the vaporization
of CuH. In this study, the mean free paths of the particles at the
process pressure of 100 Torr at room temperature and 600 K are approximately
3.5 and 7.1 μm, respectively. If an electron temperature of
0.8 eV and an electron density of 1013 cm–3 are assumed, the Debye length (in meters) is estimated to be 2.1
μm according to the following equation41 5  where Te and ne are the electron temperature (in volts) and
the electron density, respectively. If the sheath thickness is only
several times longer than the Debye length, the sheath thickness is
calculated to be ∼8 μm. When the gas temperature is sufficiently
higher than room temperature, the mean free path becomes comparable
to the sheath thickness. In this case, the ions in the plasma could
be accelerated in the sheath region with relatively fewer collisions
among the particles and ion impingement on the CuH surface appears
to be a possible candidate for CuH vaporization enhancement. In this
case, nitrogen addition may also enhance the ion impingement effect
by forming heavier ion species such as N2+ rather
than H3+ in the pure H2 plasma. However,
because no etch rate enhancements by Ar dilution were observed, ion
bombardment does not appear to play a main role in etch rate enhancement
in the N2-added plasma. At the present stage, although
the detailed mechanism of etching enhancement based on N2 addition is yet to be clarified, surface nitridation plays an important
role in Cu etching.

for the
10% N2-added plasma. For comparison, Cu etch rates obtained
by the pure H2 (○) and etch rate for SiO2 glass (Δ) by the 10% N2-added plasma are also shown.
The stage temperature and total flow rate are 0 °C and 10 SLM,
respectively.

Figure 6 Presumed etching models
for the (a) N2-added hydrogen
plasma and (b) pure hydrogen plasma. The defective nitride layer acts
as a barrier layer for both atomic hydrogen and nitriding species.
Suppression of hydrogen diffusion into the copper bulk leads to inhibition
of void formation. Accumulation of atomic hydrogen in the nitride
layer also enhances copper hydride formation. The copper that was
exposed to the pure H2 plasma contained excessive amounts
of hydrogen in the bulk (b). The excess hydrogen in the metal forms
voids, causing surface roughness.

Figure 7a,b
shows
cross-sectional SEM images of the trench-patterned Si wafer before
and after 10% N2-added plasma etching, respectively. Figure 7c shows a bird’s-eye
view SEM image of the N2-added plasma-etched sample. The
plasma exposure time and WVHF were 1 min
and 40 W, respectively. As shown in Figure 7, the superfluous Cu film was removed by
plasma etching, leaving the required Cu film in the trench. In addition,
the TaN film acted as an etch barrier for the N2-added
plasma. In contrast, Figure 7d shows a bird’s-eye view SEM image of the sample after
pure H2 plasma etching. The etching time and WVHF were 3 min and 70 W, respectively. The pure H2 plasma-etched surface was rougher than that etched using
the N2-added plasma. Furthermore, a porous structure containing
a lot of voids was observed on the pure H2 plasma-etched
surface. Since the surface roughness of Cu wiring is correlated to
its resistivity,42,43 N2-added plasma etching
is more suitable for Cu wiring processing than pure H2 plasma
etching. From the above results, we can conclude that N2 addition is a simple but effective solution to the problem of Cu
etching using the H2-based high-pressure plasma.

4 Conclusions
In this study, to improve the
dry etching properties of Cu when
using the high-pressure hydrogen-based plasma, nitrogen gas was added
to the plasma atmosphere. A maximum Cu etch rate of 2.4 μm/min
was obtained with nitrogen addition at a H2 mixture ratio
(CH2) of 0.9 and an input power
of 70 W. This Cu etch rate is 8 times higher than that of the pure
hydrogen plasma. Furthermore, nitrogen addition at the CH2 of 0.9 changed the surface roughness and
morphology of the etched surface dramatically. The etched surface
became smooth with nitrogen addition reducing the density of nanosized
voids. The plasma optical emission spectra indicated that the increase
of the copper etch rate obtained by adding N2 gas was not
due to the increase of atomic hydrogen density in the 10% N2-added plasma. The Cu etch rate increased with increasing input power.
The maximum etching rate attained was 3.1 μm/min at an input
power of 100 W and a CH2 of
0.9. On the other hand, the etch rate for SiO2 decreased
with nitrogen addition when compared to that for the pure hydrogen
plasma. This also indicated that the increased Cu etch rate with nitrogen
addition was not induced by increased atomic hydrogen density but
by nitrogen-related surface reactions. As a result, the etch selectivity
between SiO2 and Cu reached 190. Using this selectivity,
the unnecessary Cu film was removed, leaving the required Cu film
in the trench. We conclude that this etching method has demonstrated
a partial capability for use as an alternative Cu wiring technique.
