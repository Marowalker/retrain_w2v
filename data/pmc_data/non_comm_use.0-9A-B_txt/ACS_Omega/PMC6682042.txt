Design
and development of multifunctional materials have drawn
incredible attraction in recent years. Herein, we report the design
and construction of versatile star-shaped intramolecular charge transfer
(ICT)-coupled excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT)-active
mechanoresponsive and aggregation-induced emissive (AIE) luminogen
triaminoguanidine-diethylaminophenol (LH3)
conjugate from simple precursors triaminoguanidine hydrochloride and
4-(N,N-diethylamino)salicylaldehyde.
Solvent-dependent dual emission in nonpolar to polar protic solvents
implies the presence of ICT-coupled ESIPT features in the excited
state. Aggregation-enhanced emissive feature of LH3 was established in the CH3CN/water mixture. Furthermore,
this compound exhibits mechanochromic fluorescence behavior upon external
grinding. Fluorescence microscopy images of pristine, crystal, and
crushed crystals confirm the naked-eye mechanoresponsive characteristics
of LH3. In addition, LH3 selectively sensed a Cu2+ ion through a colorimetric
and fluorescence “turn-off” route, and subsequently,
the LH3-Cu2+ ensemble could act
as a selective and sensitive sensor for S2– in a
“turn-on” fluorescence manner via a metal displacement
approach. Reversible “turn-off–turn-on” features
of LH3 with Cu2+/S2– ions were efficiently demonstrated to construct the IMPLICATION
logic gate function. The Cu2+/S2–-responsive
sensing behavior of LH3 was established in
the paper strip experiment also, which can easily be characterized
by the naked eye under daylight as well as a UV lamp (λ = 365
nm).

Introduction
Construction of multifunctional
luminescent organic materials has
attracted enormous amount of awareness over the past two decades for
their extensive applications in diverse fields such as light-emitting
devices, sensing, and biomedical applications.1−8 Most of the conventional fluorescent materials exhibit weak or nonemissive
features in the solid state (aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ)) and
inhibit their real-time applications.9,10 For the day-to-day
application of these materials, reconstruction on functionality of
these materials was needed to acquire the excellent solid-state emission.
Recently, enormous effort has been devoted to develop the molecule
that shows a weak emission in the solution state and enhanced emissive
features in the aggregated state or solid state, and this behavior
is known as aggregation-induced emission (AIE).9,10 Various
strategies have been utilized to enhance the luminescent behavior
in the aggregated state or solid state, which included incorporation
of an intramolecular charge transfer unit (ICT), twisted intramolecular
charge transfer units (TICT),11 and an
excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) unit in the molecular
architecture12,13 and also restriction of intramolecular
motions by aggregation or by putting it in a solid matrix. Among these,
ESIPT-active fluorescent molecules have attracted a lot due to multidisciplinary
applications.12−17 ESIPT is a four-step photochemical process; these molecules possess
intramolecular hydrogen bonding between a proton donor such as hydroxyl
or an amino group and proton acceptor such as imine nitrogen or carbonyl
oxygen in the ground state. The proton transfer/relocation occurs
between the proton donor and the proton acceptor unit in the excited
state; that is, phototautomerization (enol form is converted into
keto form) occurs in an ultrafast timescale under photoexcitation
condition. These molecules normally characterized by intrinsic large
Stokes shift, dual emission, and environment-dependent optical properties
due to the influence of significant structural alteration occur in
the excited state. An ESIPT-active molecule finds various applications
in different fields such as electroluminescent materials, optical
sensor, and laser applications.12−17 Stimuli-responsive materials are organic or organometallic molecules
that exhibit reversible optical properties with concomitant morphological
changes upon undergoing external forces such as grinding, acid, thermal
force, etc.18−23 In general, external stimuli altered the intra- and intermolecular
interactions present in the systems, which ultimately influence the
luminescence characteristics of the molecule. Hence, luminescent properties
are directly related to the weaker interaction present in the molecular
assemblies.18a Exclusively, construction
of mechanoresponsive luminescent (MRL) materials is of great interest
since grinding is used as external stimuli, which is facile and easy
to handle also. It is well known that the diethylamino group could
act as a strong electron-donating group, salicylaldimine moiety could
act as an electron acceptor unit,14c and
incorporation of these two units in a molecule induces strong donor–acceptor-based
intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) features in the molecular systems.
Diethylaminophenol-appended fluorescent molecules have attracted huge
interest and find multiple applications in various fields.24 Further, salicylaldehyde azine is one of the
well-known classical ESIPT molecules due to the presence of strong
intramolecular hydrogen bond between −OH (proton donor) and
—N=CH (proton acceptor).14,15 Design and
development of the versatile molecules possessing ESIPT and ICT cores
are very scarce.15,25−31 In this vein, herein, we report the design and construction of versatile
star-shaped luminescent organic molecule triaminoguanidine-diethylaminophenol
conjugate (LH3). The triaminoguanidine unit
was used to construct the star-shaped architecture as well as to improve
the proton-accepting capacity; diethylamino and salicylaldimine groups
were employed to enrich a strong donor–acceptor feature in
this system. The triaminoguanidine-diethylaminophenol conjugate LH3 comprises three imine and diethylaminophenol
moieties, which are integrated through simple and facile hydrazone
linkage by the Schiff base condensation reaction from carefully chosen
building units. Further, we demonstrated the mechanoresponsive luminescence
(MRL) behavior, aggregation-induced emissive features in the CH3CN/water mixture, and reversible sensing characteristics of LH3 toward Cu2+/S2– ions. Reversible turn-off–turn-on features of LH3 with Cu2+/S2– ions were
efficiently demonstrated to construct the IMPLICATION logic gate function.
In addition, this reversible characteristic was established to develop
a paper strip-based device for on-site applications.

Results and Discussion
Design and construction of star-shaped organic molecules have received
tremendous interest, owing to their interdisciplinary applications
in multiple fields. Triaminoguanidine is a well-known building block
for the construction of a star-shaped C3-symmetric ligand
or probe.32,33 The triaminoguanidine scaffold has been
utilized as a structural building unit for the construction of diethylaminophenol-functionalized,
star-shaped organic molecules. Further, the star-shaped molecule was
designed such that the periphery of the molecule comprises a strong
electron-donating diethylamino group and the inner core is built up
with ESIPT-active acceptor units (OH···N=CH).
As a result, the expected molecule holds three donor–acceptor
units integrated with the ESIPT-active core. The molecule was synthesized
by the simple condensation reaction between triaminoguanidine hydrochloride
with 4-diethylamino salicylaldehyde in moderate yield (LH3) (Scheme 1). The formation of the compound was confirmed by spectral
studies and single-crystal XRD analysis. The newly designed molecule
has carbon-centered donor–acceptor conjugates, where it holds
three strong electron-donating diethylamino groups in the circumference
of the system, which are linked to the center carbon via facile hydrazone
linkages.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of LH3
Photophysical Properties
Incorporation
of the strong
donor–acceptor unit besides proton transfer moieties in the
molecules will deliver the photophysical properties more dominated
by a combination of ICT and ESIPT phenomena.12−17 To authenticate the projected photophysical properties of compound LH3, absorption and emission studies have been
carried out using various solvents with different polarities. The
compound divulged a broad absorption band at 430 nm, which is characteristic
of a charge transfer band (Figure 1A). Upon excitation at 430 nm, the molecule exhibited
dual emission in various nonpolar and polar aprotic solvents with
a strong band around 470–480 nm and shoulder around 530 nm
(Figure 1B and Figure S4). The existence of dual emission in
different solvents is a characteristic of ESIPT behavior present in
the current systems. However, in polar protic solvents (methanol or
ethanol), the compound exhibited a strong emission at a longer-wavelength
(520 nm) region along with a weaker emission at a shorter-wavelength
(470 nm) region (Figure 1B). It is well known that the polar protic solvent (methanol) inhibits
the ESIPT process by intermolecular hydrogen bonding with the molecule.15,34 But the appearance of an intense ESIPT peak at a longer-wavelength
region in methanol/ethanol might be attributed by the formation of
eight-membered rings between the intermolecular hydrogen-bonded alcohol
and molecule.32a,35 Further, owing to the presence
of proton transfer (ESIPT) and charge transfer groups (ICT) in molecules,
the ICT process was expected to occur between the diethylamino group
and imino acceptor unit, which could further increase the proton-accepting
ability of imine nitrogen from the intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded
phenolic OH group (ESIPT) and lead to the ICT-coupled ESIPT process
in the excited state.15 Hence, large Stoke-shifted
∼100 nm lower energy band at a higher wavelength was assigned
to the charge-coupled proton-transferred keto form (K*), and the less
Stoke-shifted ∼40–50 nm higher energy band was assigned
to the enol form (E*) in the excited species.15 The fluorescence quantum yield (Φ) for LH3 was measured in different solvents with varying polarities,
and results are given in Table S1. Due
to the presence of a strong electron-donating group in the periphery
of the system, it facilitates the electron transfer from the diethylamino
group to hydrogen-bonded imine nitrogen and led to the ICT-coupled
ESIPT in the excited state.14,15,25,26

in different organic solvents. (B) Emission spectra of LH3 (5 μM) in different organic solvents (λex = 430 nm).

In addition, to elucidate ESIPT behavior, the density functional
theory calculations were carried out to estimate the energy gap of
the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) for the keto and enol forms of LH3. Using the B3LYP/6-31G* level of electronic structure
theory, the geometries of the two molecules were energy-minimized.
Normal mode frequency calculations were performed to make sure that
the stationary point computed is a minimum and not a saddle point.
Calculations were performed using the electronic structure theory
program NWChem,36 and the computed energy-minimized
geometries of the two molecules are shown in Figure S5. Electronic structure calculations (including zero-point
energy corrections) show that the enol form is more stable by 24.902
kcal/mol with respect to the keto form. The computed HOMO–LUMO
energy gap of keto and enol forms are 2.57 and 2.76 eV, respectively.

AIE Characteristics of LH3
In general,
molecules containing freely rotatable and quickly isomerizable
units undergo nonradiative deactivation of excited states easily.9−13 Hence, restriction or prohibition of nonradiative relaxation through
inhibition of molecular motions such as rotation or isomerization
via molecular aggregation leads to enhanced emission behavior.9−13 Due to the presence of donor–acceptor conjugates with free
rotatable N–N bond and an easily isomerizable CH=N group
in molecule LH3, the effect of molecular aggregation
on photophysical properties was investigated.14 The influence of aggregation on optical properties of compound LH3 was studied by UV–vis and emission measurements
in a CH3CN/water solvent mixture with varying water content
(0 to 99%), and the observations are shown in Figure 2. Upon excitation at 430 nm, LH3 exhibits weak emission as a broad peak around 485
nm with shoulder at 535 nm in pure CH3CN. When the amount
of water content was 40%, the dual peak was merged as a broad band,
and at 50%, it started to appear as a strong major peak at 513 nm
with two shoulders at 494 and 553 nm. The ∼46-fold enhancement
in emission intensity clearly indicates the formation of aggregates.
After 50% water content, the emission intensity was slowly decreased
with increase in water content. This observed behavior clearly indicates
the formation of an organic nanoaggregate at 50% water content.5a,13c,26 Formation of the nanoaggregate
was further ascertained by dynamic light scattering (DLS), field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) measurements, and quantum yield
calculations (Table S2). Compound LH3 shows a level-off tail in UV–vis absorption
measurements (Figure S6) when water content
was above 50% in the CH3CN/water mixture, further attesting
the characteristic features of the aggregate formation.13c,26 AIE characteristics of LH3 in the CH3CN/water mixture can be easily visualized through the naked
eye under a UV lamp as well as in daylight (Figure S7), which indicates the aggregate formation behavior of LH3 in the CH3CN/water mixture (Figure 2C).

Emission intensity of LH3 in different CH3CN/water fraction. (C) Fluorescence photo
of LH3 with increasing water fractions (0–99%)
under a UV lamp (365 nm).

In dilute CH3CN, LH3 displays
weak emission due to the presence of a free rotatable N–N single
bond and an easily isomerizable CH=N moiety in LH3, which destroys the excited state through nonradiative
decay and produces a weak or nonemissive behavior. Upon increasing
the water fraction, LH3 starts to precipitate
as aggregates due to the low solubility, which hinder the various
types of intramolecular motions and display an enhanced emission at
50% water content.9−13 Further, comparative results from emission measurements in highly
viscous glycerol/CH3CN and nonviscous water/CH3CN mixtures (Figure S8) inferred that
the restriction of intramolecular rotation (RIR) mechanism also operated
in addition to ICT-coupled ESIPT phenomenon for enhanced emission
in this compound.9−13 In addition, increment in emission intensity was observed in an
ice-cold solution of CH3CN, DMSO, and toluene compared
to emission measurements at room temperature, which clearly indicates
the presence of RIR mechanism (Figure S9). FE-SEM and DLS measurements were also used to validate the formation
of aggregates. The DLS result divulges that the particle size of an
aggregate at 50% is larger than that of an aggregate at 99% of water
content in the CH3CN/water mixture (Figure S10). Morphological changes were also observed for LH3 in pure CH3CN and aggregates at
50% of water content in the CH3CN/water mixture, which
are confirmed by FE-SEM images (Figure S11).

Mechanoresponsive Luminescent Behavior of LH3
In general, AIE- and ESIPT-active donor–acceptor
molecules have a stimuli-responsive behavior.18−24 Hence, the mechanoresponsive emissive behavior of LH3 was investigated by solid-state emission measurements. The
pristine sample exhibits a broad weak emissive band at 497 nm, whereas
after external grinding, the ground sample shows enhanced emission
intensity with a red shift in peak position at 513 nm (Figure S12). The bathochromic shift of ∼16
nm from the pristine state to the ground state was evidenced by luminescent
color change from yellow to greenish yellow under a UV lamp (λ
= 365 nm) (Figure 3 and Video S1). Upon grinding, the emission
intensity was increased, and it remained the same as long as there
is no disruption on it, while even scraping the ground sample by a
spatula caused a decrease in the emission intensity (Video S2). Further recrystallization of the ground sample
produces the original state of the molecule. Congruently, quantum
yield increases from 0.92 to 13.54% upon grinding. Powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) studies of pristine- and ground-state samples support the existence
of morphology changes from the crystalline nature of the pristine
state to the amorphous nature of the ground state. The pristine sample
produces the strong and well-resolved intense line (crystalline state)
in PXRD, while the ground sample exhibits (amorphous) broad peaks
(Figure S13). Further, SEM analysis was
carried out to validate the morphological changes that occur from
the pristine state to the ground state upon grinding (Figure S14). These observations visibly indicates
that the facile simple mechanical force produces the morphological
changes as well as destroys the weak intermolecular interaction and
transforms the twisted propeller structure into a somewhat planar
structure with a change in color as well as emission intensity.14c The physical state-dependent luminescent behaviors
of crystals, pristine, and crushed crystals were studied under a fluorescence
microscope as well as in daylights (Figure S15), and results indicate that fluorescent behavior was enhanced in
crushed crystals compared to crystal, and the as-synthesized sample
and its corresponding fluorescence microscopy images are represented
in Figure 4.

Solid-State Structure of LH3
To
correlate the ESIPT and AIE behavior of the compound LH3 with molecular arrangements, single-crystal analysis
was carried out. The fluorescent crystal was obtained from slow diffusion
of n-hexane into a compound in chloroform. Figure 5A shows the molecular
structure of the compound. The molecule is crystallized as a neutral
molecule. It consists of three wings of 4-(Et2N)-C6H3–2-OH—CH=N—NH connected
to the central carbon atom through the N–C bond that led to
the star-shaped propeller molecular structure. In each wing, the strong
intramolecular hydrogen bonding was observed between the −OH
group from diethylaminophenolic moieties and imine nitrogen of triaminoguanidine
moiety —C(NHN=C)3— (1.901, 1.925,
and 1.92 Å) and led to a six-membered ring (Figure 5A). Further, this intramolecular
hydrogen bonding assists the ESIPT process in the excited state. Normally,
triaminoguanidinium-based Tris Schiff base compounds formed as guanidinium
salts,32,33 but this molecule was formed/crystalized
as a neutral molecule, which may be due to the strong electron-donating
nature of the diethylamino group present in the periphery of the system.
All the three wings are not present in the same plane and are twisted
to each other by 37.055° (planes 1 and 2), 35.420° (planes
1 and 3), and 38.762° (planes 2 and 3) (Figure S16). Subsequently, the whole molecule adopts the propeller-shaped
conformation in the solid state (Figure 5B and Figure S16A). Further, this molecule forms a dimer by strong C···C
interaction (3.154 Å, Figure 5B) between the center carbon atoms of two neighboring
molecules, and through C–H···π interaction,
it adopts a one-dimensional polymeric chain (Figure 5c and Figure S16B). The presence of propeller-shaped conformation in LH3 inhibits the aggregation-caused quenching by destroying
the strong π–π stacking interaction between diethylamino
phenol rings.22−24 Here, the propeller-shaped conformation of LH3, intramolecular hydrogen bonding between OH···N
and intermolecular CH···O, and CH···π
interaction plays a predominant role in AIE and mechanochromic luminescent
behaviors.

polymeric chain structure of LH3.

Analytical Studies of LH3
Recently,
considerable interest in the development of an ESIPT-based turn-on
or turn-off sensor for selective detection of metal ions is based
on inhibition of the ESIPT process through the coordination of metal
ions.37,38 Herein, LH3 has
three binding sites, each binding site consisting of a phenolic hydroxyl
group and imine nitrogen and NH from a triaminoguanidine unit. Hence,
the metal-sensing performance of LH3 has been
investigated by UV–vis absorption and emission measurements
toward various metal ions such as Ag(I), Al(III), Ca(II), Cd(II),
Co(II), Cu(II), Cr(III), Fe(III), Mn(II), Mg(II), Na(I), Ni(II), Pb(II),
Hg(II), and Zn(II) in CH3CN/H2O (10 mM Tris–HCl;
pH = 7.2; 9:1, v/v) mixture. The corresponding metal ions were used
as their perchlorate or nitrate salts. The absorption spectral result
of the probe LH3 with and without metal ions
indicates that only Cu2+ induces changes in the absorption
band, whereas no changes were observed with the rest of the metal
ions (Figure S17A). Absorption titration
experiments were carried out between the probe and Cu2+. The incremental addition of Cu2+ to the probe produces
the red shift in position of the absorption band from 420 to 460 nm
with a clear isosbestic point at 440 nm (Figure S17B). This result confirms the formation of new species. Further,
upon excitation at 430 nm, LH3 (20 μM)
exhibits a sharp peak around 470 nm in CH3CN/H2O (10 mM Tris–HCl; pH = 7.2; 9:1, v/v) mixture. The outcome
from the emission measurement of LH3 with
and without metal ions confirms that the probe shows selective sensitivity
toward Cu2+ over the other metal ions via a fluorescence
turn-off mode (Figure 6A). Interestingly, during the gradual addition of Cu2+ to the probe, emission intensity was completely quenched after the
addition of 3 equiv of Cu2+ ions (Figure 6B). This titration result indicates the formation
of 1:3 complexes between the probe and Cu2+ ion. Further,
results from a Job plot39 (Figure S19) and Benesi–Hildebrand analysis40 also confirm that the 1:3 complex formation
occurs between LH3 and Cu2+. In
addition, mass spectral analysis of in situ-prepared LH3-Cu2+ also confirms the 1:3 stoichiometric
ratio, and it shows m/z values for
[LCu3Cl3(DMSO) + 2H+]2+ at 502.56 (Figure S20). The IR spectral
changes of the probe with and without Cu2+ ions clearly
demonstrate the coordination of imine nitrogen to the metal ion (Figure S21). The deprotonation of −OH
groups occurs during the formation of LH3-Cu2+ ensembles, which inhibit the ESIPT process and resulted
in the gradual decrease in the emission intensity.41 Further drastic decrease in the quantum yield was observed
from 0.25 to 0.08% upon addition of Cu2+ to the probe with
a naked eye-detectable color change from fluorescent green to nonemissive
under UV light (365 nm). It is interesting to note that the limit
of detection value of LH3 for Cu2+ was calculated as 2.33 × 10–7 M (23.3 ppm)
(Figure S22), which is below the permissible
value of Cu2+ in drinking water according to WHO.42 Further, the association constant was found
to be 4.78 × 106 M–1, and it implies
that the probe has strong binding affinity to the Cu2+ ion.
Further, to access the selectivity of LH3 toward
the Cu2+ ion, competitive photophysical measurements were
carried out for LH3 with other metal ions
in the presence of Cu2+, and the results are represented
in Figure S23. The result clearly implies
that the probe has strong selectivity toward Cu2+ over
the other metal ions and it could act as a fluorescent turn-off sensor
for the Cu2+ ion. The quenching behavior of Cu2+ might be due to the paramagnetic nature of Cu2+, inhibition
of ESIPT, and chelation-enhanced quenching.41,43

metal ions under UV light at 365 nm.

It is well known that Cu2+ ions have strong affinity
toward the S2– anion,44,45,49−51 and this validates the selective
sensing behavior of LH3-Cu2+ assembly
toward S2– through displacement approach. The anion-sensing
characteristic of in situ-prepared LH3-Cu2+ ensemble was evaluated by absorption and fluorescence experiments
in the presence of various anions. The response of absorption and
emission titration measurements indicates that gradual addition of
S2– to LH3-Cu2+ induces the regaining of photophysical characteristics of the ligand
via displacement of Cu2+ from LH3-Cu2+ by formation of the Cu–S complex with bare
probe-resulted turn-on emission as well as colorimetric changes (Scheme S1, Figure 7, and Figure S25). The S2– response by the composite probe LH3-Cu2+ is visible via color changes from colorless
to bluish green under a UV lamp (Figure 7C). Further, competitive experiments confirm
the selective sensing of S2– by the LH3-Cu2+ ensemble. Hence, LH3-Cu2+ could act as a colorimetric as well as fluorescent
turn-on sensor exclusively for S2– (Figure 7 and Figure S25). The limit-of-detection value and association constant
of LH3-Cu2+ ensembles toward S2– were found to be 2.05 × 10–7 M and 4.43 × 106 M–1, respectively.
The above results authenticate that the probe LH3 could be used as a reversible and reusable sensor for Cu2+ and S2– ions (Figure 8 and Figure S26). Further, the recycle ability of LH3 was
checked by consecutive addition of Cu2+ and S2– ions to LH3, and their associated colorimetric
responses under a UV lamp clearly indicate the recycle characteristic
and stability of LH3 for more than five cycles
and future utilization for sensing applications (Figure S26). The practical application of the probe LH3 for the detection of Cu2+ and S2– ions was carried out in real water samples such as
drinking water and tap water, and the results are presented in Tables S3 and S4.

Construction of IMPLICATION Logic Gate
The reversible
and selective on–off–on sensing characteristics of LH3 toward Cu2+ and S2– induced us to explore the construction of molecular switches by
our systems.45a,46−49 Herein, the introduction of Cu2+ and S2– ions to the probe LH3 is abbreviated as inputs 1 and 2, and resultant emission
intensity is denoted as an output. The decrement of emission intensity
is denoted as output “0”, and regaining of emission
intensity is denoted as output “1”. The emissive nature
of the probe makes output as “1” even in the absence
of both inputs. Addition of Cu2+ quenches the emissive
nature of the probe; hence, the output is 0. Introduction of S2– to the above solution (LH3-Cu2+) regains the emission, and the resultant output
is 1, whereas addition of S2– to the bare probe
causes no change in emission, leading to output “1”.
The reversible sensing characteristics of LH3 toward Cu2+ and S2– satisfied the requirements
of IMPILICATION logic gate, and the corresponding truth table is given
in (Figure 8).45a,49

On-Site Detection of Cu2+ and S2–
Exclusive colorimetric and selective turn-off sensing behavior
of LH3 toward Cu2+ was established
by paper strip experiments.52 Under a UV
lamp, the bluish green color was changed to blue color in the presence
of a Cu2+ ion, whereas the other metal ion did not produce
any changes in the LH3-coated filter paper
(Figure 9A). Further,
a LH3-Cu2+-coated paper was utilized
to selectively discriminate S2– ions over the other
anions by converting to the original color of an LH3-coated paper, which is easily visible to the naked eye under
a UV lamp (Figure 9B). These results clearly indicate that the LH3-coated paper can act as a sensing device for the on-site detection
of Cu2+ and S2– ions.

Conclusions
In summary, a star-shaped propeller-like
diethylaminophenol-triaminoguanidine
conjugate was synthesized from readily accessible building blocks.
The molecules exhibit polarity-dependent dual emissions in various
solvents. In polar protic solvents, LH3 exhibits
dominant ICT-coupled ESIPT emission. The aggregation-enhanced emission
features of LH3 were demonstrated in the CH3CN/water mixture. The mechanochromic luminescence characteristic
of LH3 was established by grinding and confirmed
by PXRD experiments of ground and unground samples. In addition, LH3 selectively detects the Cu2+ ion
in a colorimetric and fluorescent turn-off manner. In situ-prepared LH3-Cu2+ ensembles selectively detect
S2– ions over the various anions through the colorimetric
and fluorescent turn-on pathway. Reversibility of LH3 toward Cu2+ and S2– is stable
over more than five cycles. Further, the sensing feature of LH3 was utilized to develop the IMPILICATION logic
gate function and on-site analysis of Cu2+ and S2– ions by a paper strip-based device.

General Methods
4-Diethylaminosalicylaldehyde and guanidine hydrochloride were
procured from Sigma Aldrich. Analytical grade solvents and reagents
were purified by standard methods and used for the synthesis. FT-IR
spectra for LH3 and LH3-Cu2+ were measured by using a JASCO FTIR 4100 instrument
with a frequency range of 4000 to 400 cm–1. CDCl3 was used as a solvent to measure the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of LH3 on a Bruker
Avance (400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C)
instrument. Tetramethylsilane was used as a standard for the presentation
of chemical shifts (δ values, ppm), and coupling constants are
reported in hertz (Hz). The following abbreviations are used: singlet
(s), doublet (d), triplet (t), and quartet (q). The melting point
of the sample was determined on a Guna melting point apparatus and
was uncorrected. They are expressed in °C. A JASCO V-630 UV–Visible
spectrophotometer was used to measure the absorption spectral measurements
by using 1.0 cm path length Quartz cuvettes. For all the absorption
measurements, 1 × 10–3 M stock solution was
prepared, and during the experiments, 5 μL was taken in a cuvette
and diluted to 2.5 mL by suitable solvents.

A JASCO FP-8300
spectrofluorometer equipped with a 1.0 cm path
length quartz cuvette was used for the emission spectral experiments
and excited at 430 nm. The emission spectra were monitored in the
wavelength range of 450–800 nm. All the measurements were carried
out at ambient temperature (25 °C). For solvent-dependent emission
measurements, 1 × 10–3 M stock solution was
prepared in the respective solvent, and 125 μL was taken in
a cuvette and diluted to 2.5 mL by appropriate solvents. For sensing
measurements, 1 × 10–3 M stock solution was
prepared in CH3CN, and 20 μL was diluted to 2.5 mL
by using CH3CN/H2O (9:1, v/v) (10 mM Tris–HCl-buffered
solution, pH 7.2). Stock solutions for metal salts were prepared in
distilled water with a concentration of 1 × 10–3 M. A HORIBA FluoroMax was used for solid-state fluorescence measurements.

Dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments are recorded by the
Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument equipped with a 4.0 mW He–Ne
laser operating at a wavelength of 633 nm at room temperature. Field
emission scanning electron microscopy images were taken from FEI Quanta
250. High-resolution mass spectra were recorded on an Exactive Plus
EMR Orbitrap mass spectrometer using the electron spray ionization
(ESI) technique. A CKX 41 (Olympus) fluorescence microscope was used
to capture the fluorescent images of crystal, pristine, and crushed
crystals.

A Bruker D8 QUEST diffractometer was used to measure
the single-crystal
X-ray diffraction data of LH3. Measurement
was carried out at 296(2) K using a graphite-monochromatic Mo Kα
radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The Bruker SAINT Software package53 using a narrow-frame algorithm was used to integrate
the data. Absorption correction was performed using SADABS.54 Structure was solved with multiscan method using
SHELXT. The structure was refined by full-matrix least squares on
F2 using the SHELXL-2014/7 program.55 Nonhydrogen
atoms were refined freely with anisotropic displacement parameters.
The hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions and refined
with a riding model.

Synthesis of LH3
Triaminoguanidinium
chloride was prepared according to the following literature method.32 Triaminoguanidinium chloride (0.230 g, 1.64
mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of ethanol (5 mL) and water (2.5
mL) at 80 °C, and it was stirred for 10 min. To the above solution,
4-diethylaminosalicylaldehyde (0.983 g, 5.10 mmol) in ethanol was
added dropwise, and the mixture was allowed to reflux at 80 °C
for 12 h. Then, the resulting yellow precipitate was filtered off,
