Four
mononuclear bioefficient imine-based coordination complexes, [(L1)2Cu], [(L1)2Zn], [(L2)Cu(H2O)], and [(L2)Zn(H2O)], were synthesized
using ligands [L1 = 2-(((3-hydroxynaphthalen-2-yl)methylene)amino)-2-methylpropane-1,3-diol
and L2 = 4-(1-((1,3-dihydroxy-2-methylpropan-2-yl)imino)ethyl)benzene-1,3-diol].
The formation of the complexes was ascertained by elemental analysis,
Fourier transform infrared, 1H NMR, 13C NMR,
electrospray ionization–mass spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic
resonance, and thermogravimetric analysis. The comparative binding
propensity profiles of the above-synthesized complexes with the DNA/human
serum albumin (HSA) were investigated via UV absorption, fluorescence,
and Förster resonance energy-transfer studies. On the basis
of extended conjugation and planarity, L1 complexes exhibited superior bioactivity with greater calculated
DNA binding constant values, (Kb) 2.9444
× 103[(L1)2Cu] and 2.2693 ×
103[(L1)2Zn], as compared to L2 complexes, 1.793 × 103[(L2)Cu(H2O)] and 9.801 × 102[(L2)Zn(H2O)]. The competitive displacement assay of complexes
was performed by means of fluorogenic dyes (EtBr and Hoechst), which
corroborates the occurrence of minor groove binding because of the
enhanced displacement activity with Hoechst 33258. The minor groove
binding of the [(L1)2Cu] complex is further confirmed
by the molecular docking study. Moreover, the HSA study demonstrated
effective static quenching of complexes with substantial Ksv values. The [(L1)2Cu] complex was
found to have pronounced cleavage efficiency as evaluated from sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis electrophoresis.
Furthermore, in vitro antioxidant activity against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl
and superoxide radicals further proclaimed the remarkable bioefficiency
of compounds, which make them promising as active chemotherapeutic
agents.

1 Introduction
Coordination complexes of imine scaffolds are an indispensable
class of chemistry because of their structural divergence and binding
protocols. Imines are rationalized as novel ligands, which are eminently
used because of their flexible entanglement, striking versatility,
and facile solubility in common solvents.1,2 They
are broadly employed for their greater yield and are generally synthesized
by the condensation of the ketone or aldehyde with an amine under
variable conditions of temperature, pH, and solvents. The presence
of azomethine linkage (−C=N) in the imines has gained
interest because of their stability, chelating property, and diverse
biological applications.3−5

Structural–activity
approach has been anticipated as an
efficacious platform for the discovery of potent drugs in the area
of therapeutic science.6 Nowadays, various
protocols are under extensive research for the refinement of such
prototypes in which a molecular hybridization process has emerged
as a powerful and advanced approach for rational designing of ligand
scaffolds, which depend on the pharmacophoric entities present in
the ligand framework. Thus, it leads to the formation of a new framework,
which bears intrinsic properties of the initial pattern and manifests
an innovative formulation with enhanced affinity and efficacy in comparison
to the parent drug.7,8 The prudent selection of the two
precursors controls the resulting ligand’s denticity, donor
atom’s nature, and the number of chelating moieties.9 An enormous number of imines has been designed
and widely studied as they have some emblematic properties such as
striking biological properties, flexible synthesis, thermal stability,
novel structural and medicinal efficacies, etc. Imine-based metal
complexes are progressively studied because of facile synthesis, crystallographic
features, biological activity, and redox and catalytic properties.
Earlier research has shown that metal complexes have better bioactivity
than the free inorganic ligands (imines) as insertion of active metal
centers enhances the stability of the metal complexes, thereby making
them extremely valuable probes for the biological system.10,11 Imine-based N,O donor metal complexes are extensively utilized as
snipping agents for DNA binding studies focused on antitumor medications.
In a recent study, Reedjik et al. described DNA binding and the cleaving
capacity of a complex comprising Cu(II) Schiff base, which exhibited
huge potential in cytotoxic consequences for HL 60 (leukemia) disease
cells. Lou and co-workers have also synthesized a new cytotoxic copper(II)
complex, which displayed promising antitumor activity over the breast
tumor cell line (MCF-7cells).12,13 The investigation of
DNA interaction with the Schiff base complex is a preliminary step
to develop and symphonize a new pharmaceutical molecule. The small-molecule
moieties incorporating drugs can associate with DNA via three binding
models cooperation with sections of DNA by hydrogen bonding, electrostatic
binding amidst negatively charged DNA phosphate residues and cation
species, or intercalative and van der Waals interactions.14−17 Imine-based complexes are also considered as promising candidates
against malignancy drugs and have high proclivity for human serum
albumin (HSA) binding. Remarkably, HSA is the amplest plasma protein,
which is related to binding and drug transportation in the blood.
The literature demonstrated that albumins from blood plasma could
interact with most imine-based complexes.18 The interaction of drug with protein makes a stabilized drug–protein
complex, which consequently makes an effect on drug distribution and
its metabolism in the blood. The distribution of drugs is generally
taken up by HSA as mainly drugs move in the plasma and achieve the
targeted tissues through binding to albumin, hence functionalize as
a most preferential substitute for the purpose of drug delivery.18 Among all the transition metals reported for
their biological relevance, copper was found to have a vital role
in chemotherapy.19 Copper exists as a central
metal ion in many metalloproteins and affects their functioning by
adjusting the geometrical arrangement of ligands around it.1 It exists in two biologically active forms, +1
and +2, out of which +2 is the most stable form and was found to have
more potential to alter various biological processes. Direct interaction
of copper with DNA causes site-specific cleavage, thereby generating
reactive oxygen species (ROS) under required optimum conditions. Copper-based
synthetic compounds have the tendency to facilitate the cleavage of
nucleic acid (DNA); therefore, they are gaining a lot of interest
for both in vitro and in vivo advanced oncogenic studies.20−23 The copper complexes were also reported as the potential alternatives
to anticancer agents(cisplatin)24,25 and play an indispensable
role in cell physiology as potent-free radical scavengers. Zinc is
also an integral cofactor in many biological processes and is the
second most abundant 3d metal in human body. Zinc complexes have various
rich coordination affinities with a variety of macromolecules which
mechanistically have dynamic influence on transcription and DNA replication.26−28

Nowadays, imine-based ligands having mixed donor atoms (N
and O)
are preferred as their derivatives are versatile and have the ability
to form high nuclearity compounds. Polydentate pharmacophore such
as 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3 propanediol has been intrinsically explored
because of their diverse structural and pharmacological applications.29,30 Imine bases derived from hydroxy naphthaldehyde have been broadly
examined because of their substantial uses in therapeutic field. They
outline stable adducts with metal particles owing to the occurrence
of ortho phenolic hydroxyl group, which reconciliate to the metal
particle by means of deprotonation. Hydroxy naphthaldehyde exhibits
strong steric hindrance and high conjugating property because of the
naphthyl ring, thereby forming imine-based metal complexes with more
coordination sites and higher stability.1,31

In the
light of the above given details and in the expansion of
our current research on imine-based complexes using hybrid pharmacophore
approach,32 here we design and synthesize
N,O donor imine ligands and their Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes derived
from bioactive scaffolds, 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3 propane-diol and 3-hydroxy-2-naphthaldehyde
or 2,4-dihydroxyacetophenone. The formulated compounds were structurally
and spectroscopically characterized by elemental analysis, Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electrospray
ionization–mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA). The pharmacological assessment of all synthesized
compounds based on their structural features was illustrated by biophysical
techniques (DNA/HSA binding), Förster resonance energy transfer
(FRET), sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) electrophoresis, docking, and antioxidant studies.

2 Results and Discussion
The mononuclear complexes {[(L1)2Cu], [(L1)2Zn], [(L2)Cu(H2O)], and [(L2)Zn(H2O)]} were derived
from the imine-based ligands L1 and L2, respectively. These
ligands were synthesized via condensing 3-hydroxy-2-naphthaldehyde
and 2,4-dihydroxyacetophenone with 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol
taking methanol as a solvent. All the synthesized complexes exhibited
good stability at room temperature and were soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO). The physical and analytical data of compounds are well demonstrated
in Table 1. The nonelectrolytic
nature of complexes (DMSO/1 × 10–4 M) was confirmed
from the outcomes of the molar conductance values (11–16 Ω–1 cm2 mol–1).33 The spectrochemical features as well as geometrical
aspects of synthesized compounds were ascertained by spectral studies
such as FTIR, NMR, ESI-MS, UV, TGA, and elemental analysis. The geometry
surrounding Cu(II) ions in the complexes was elucidated from the electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR), while the absorption bands of Cu(II)
complexes were detected by the electronic spectra. Moreover, binding
studies of DNA and HSA were carried out to determine various biophysical
parameters. Additionally, other biological studies such as gel electrophoresis,
molecular docking, and antioxidant activity were also performed to
further validate the biocompatible behavior of the complexes.

2.1 IR Spectra
The infrared spectra of
the newly synthesized compounds (400–4000 cm–1) were performed to assign the functional groups existing in compounds.
The IR spectra of synthesized ligands (L1 and L2) exhibited a broad
band (3416–3287 cm–1) because of stretching
vibration of aliphatic −OH. The medium intensity band (1352–1361
cm–1) signifies the presence of ν(C–O)
phenolic vibration, whereas the peak (3287–3176 cm–1) suggests the occurrence of aromatic −OH. A new strong intensity
band (1616–1625 cm–1) attributes the presence
of azomethine group (−CH=N−), which consequently
confirms the formation of proposed imine ligands.7 The absence of broad band of phenolic −OH (3287–3176
cm–1) in [(L1)2Cu], [(L1)2Zn], [(L2)Cu(H2O)], and [(L2)Zn(H2O)] complexes signifies the coordination between metal center
and phenolato oxygen atom via deprotonation.1 On subsequent metalation, the azomethine peak (1616–1625
cm–1) was shifted to a lesser frequency from its
original position, signifying the lone pair donation to metal ions
by nitrogen in all complexes. This negative shift affirms the impeccable
coordination of azomethine nitrogen toward the metal ions, which is
further affirmed by the presence of vibration peaks in the region
464–490 cm–1 ν(M–O) and 520–585
cm–1 ν(M–N), respectively.7,31 Furthermore, the peak detected (3300–3400 cm–1) in [(L2)Cu(H2O)] and [(L2)Zn(H2O)] complexes corresponds to the occurrence of coordinated water molecules,7 while bands (1435–1490, 1012–1095,
and 738–769 cm–1) are related to aromatic
ring vibrations.34

2.2 1H NMR and 13C NMR
The 1H NMR
spectra of free ligands (L1 and L2)
and their corresponding complexes, [(L1)2Zn] and [(L2)Zn(H2O)], were documented using DMSO-d6 as a solvent The 1H NMR spectra of free ligands
(L1 and L2) showed a singlet at 8.58 and 8.49 ppm, respectively
(Figure 1a,b), affirming
the presence of −CH=N– linkage, which eventually
confirms the formation of Schiff base ligands.35 The singlet hydroxyl proton appeared at 14.32 ppm for L1 and 10.19 ppm for L2.7,36 The peak appeared at
5.20 and 5.17 ppm displayed the presence of aliphatic −OH group
and the peak at 3.46, 1.37, and 3.33, 1.35 ppm displayed the aliphatic
−CH2 and −CH3 groups of both ligand
moieties. The multiplets in the range 6.67–8.16 and 6.15–7.57
ppm signified the presence of naphthalene and acetophenone ring protons,
respectively.7 Unlike free ligands, in
the 1H NMR spectra of [(L1)2Zn] and [(L2)Zn(H2O)], the hydroxyl peaks at 14.32 and 10.19 ppm
are completely disappeared, which indicates the ligation between metal
center and phenolato oxygen atom via deprotonation.27,31 The characteristic azomethine peak at 8.58 and 8.49 ppm undergoes
a negative shift in [(L1)2Zn] and [(L2)Zn(H2O)], demonstrating the coordination of zinc(II) toward
amine nitrogen.37 Furthermore, multiplet
peaks for aromatic protons undergoes downfield shift, which further
confirmed the coordination of ligands with metal center. A new peak
detected at 3.49 ppm is assigned to the coordinated water molecules
in [(L2)Zn(H2O)] (Figure S1a,b).38

Figure 1 1H NMR spectra
of ligands L1 (a) and L2 (b).

The 13C NMR results of the free ligands (L1 and L2) displayed a sharp characteristic peak due to azomethine carbon,
which resonates at 161.68 and 160.96 ppm, respectively (Figure 2a,b). The signals observed
at 117.97, 121.72, 124.87, 126.23, 126.46, 127.64, 128.69, 134.52,
137.01, and 154.85 ppm may be assigned for naphthalene carbon moieties
in the ligand framework while signals at 102.46, 109.39, 111.25, 132.98,
157.65, and 158.28 ppm may correspond to acetophenone carbons, respectively.
The signals displayed at 61.42, 64.71, 64.82, 54.47, 65.93, and 66.17
ppm may reasonably be assigned to the aliphatic carbons, and the signals
at 18.56 and 20.76 ppm belong to methyl carbon in both ligand frameworks.
The characteristic azomethine peaks at 161.68 and 160.96 ppm for L1 and L2, respectively, undergo a downfield shift in both complexes,
invoking the coordination via azomethine nitrogen and phenolic oxygen
of ligand frameworks with zinc(II).7 The
other signals mentioned above were also found to be downfield-shifted
in both these complexes corresponding to further metalation (Figure S2a,b).

2.3 Mass-Spectroscopy
The proposed molecular
formulae of the synthesized ligands L1 and L2 and their [(L1)2Zn] and [(L2)Zn(H2O)] complexes
are confirmed by the presence of molecular ion peaks at m/z+ 260.30, 240.13, 580.95, and 321.49,
respectively. The fragmentation of L1 confirms a medium intensity peak at m/z 170.05 and 89.06, which are due to disintegration of [C11H8NO] and [C4H9O2] moieties, respectively, while L2 peaks appeared at m/z 103.06
and 136.05 because of successive disintegration of [C4H9NO2] and [C8H8O2] moieties from the molecular ion peak (Figure 3a,b). The fragmentation pattern of [(L1)2Zn] complex displayed important peaks at m/z 306.09 and 112.11 because of disintegration
of [C22H17N2] and [C8H16O2] moieties, whereas [(L2)Zn(H2O)] complex exhibited peaks at m/z 119.04, 86.05, and 18.01 because of loss of [C8H7O], [C4H8NO], and [OH2] moieties
from the parent complex (Figure S3a,b).
The proposed molecular formulae of [(L1)2Zn] and [(L2)Zn(H2O)] complexes are in accordance with the 1:2 and
1:1 metal-to-ligand ratio, respectively.

2.4 UV Spectra
The UV–vis spectroscopic
studies of ligands (L1 and L2) and their corresponding [(L1)2Cu] and [(L2)Cu(H2O)] complexes
were performed at room temperature in DMSO solution (250–700
nm). The bands observed in the range 305–445 nm and 220–260
nm may correspond to n−π* transition of the imine(azomethine)
group and π–π* transition of the aromatic ring
of ligand moieties (L1 and L2), respectively.39 The shifting of the bands to a higher wavelength in the
case of copper complexes confirmed the linkage of ligand frameworks
to metal ions. The intense bands at λmax 635 and
615 nm for [(L1)2Cu] and [(L2)Cu(H2O)] complexes may be attributed to 2Eg–T2g and Bg1–Ag1 transition, respectively, signifying
an octahedral and square-planar geometry around the Cu(II) ion in
the given complexes.40,41 However, the geometries of both
complexes were further confirmed by their observed magnetic moment
values of 1.92 [(L1)2Cu] and 1.85 BM [(L2)Cu(H2O)].31

2.5 Electron Paramagnetic Resonance
The
EPR spectral studies of [(L1)2Cu] and [(L2)Cu(H2O)] complexes were performed in DMSO solvent (Figure S4). The spin Hamiltonian parameter of
copper complex assists to unravel the ground state of the metal. For
axial octahedral geometry with the g tensor value g⊥ > g∥ > 2.0023, the unpaired electron was found in the dz2 orbital, and for g∥ > g⊥ > 2.0023,
the position of
unpaired electron lies in the dx2–y2 orbital in the ground
state.31 The spectra of both the copper
complexes demonstrated an isotropic signal along with the axial symmetrical
line with g∥ = 2.230 and 2.147, g⊥ = 2.070 and 2.066, respectively. The gav value was calculated from the expression gav2 = (g∥2 + 2g⊥2)/3 and was found to be
2.123 and 2.093, respectively. Here in the [Cu(L1)2] complex, the observed value of g∥ > g⊥ > 2.003 estimated to form an octahedral geometry around copper(II),42 while in the case of [Cu(L2)·H2O] complex, the value of g∥ > g⊥ > 2.003 is suggested to form a square-planar geometry.43 The exchange of interaction is measured by the
geometric parameter (G), which can be evaluated through
formula, G = g∥ – 2/g⊥ – 2 (Kneubuhl’s
method).7 It is justified in the literature
that a minimal exchange interaction if G > 4 and
a significant exchange interaction if G < 4 occur
between the copper centers.31 In our case,
the value of G for the copper complexes is 3.285 [(L1)2Cu] and 2.227 [(L2)Cu(H2O)], indicating the significant exchange behavior in the present complexes.

2.6 Thermogravimetric Analysis
The thermal
curves of [(L1)2Cu] and [(L1)2Zn] complexes showed a two-step weight loss, while [(L2)Cu(H2O)] and [(L2)Zn(H2O)] complexes showed a three-step
weight loss (Figure S5). The first decomposition
of [(L1)2Cu] and [(L1)2Zn] complexes
in the temperature range 220–480 °C displayed weight losses
(obs = 52.64 and 52.72%, cal = 52.98 and 52.84%) assigned to the disintegration
of the naphthalene part of the ligand framework at imine bond, while
the second decomposition with weight losses (obs = 24.85, 24.76%,
cal = 24.94 and 24.88%) in the temperature range 490–690 °C
could be accredited to the loss of residual organic moieties. However,
no visible change is observed in the graph of [(L1)2Cu] and [(L1)2Zn] complexes up to 200 °C,
signifying the nonoccurrence of coordinated water moieties.44 The initial thermal decomposition in [(L2)Cu(H2O)] and [(L2)Zn(H2O)] complexes revealed
weight loss (obs = 5.52 and 5.49%, cal = 5.65 and 5.62%) in the temperature
range 80–140 °C, corresponding to the coordinated water
molecules, while the second disintegration step showed weight loss
(obs = 27.23 and 26.70%, cal = 27.00 and 26.88%) in the temperature
range 220–350 °C, which may be owing to the decomposition
of propanediol moieties of L2 ligand at the imine bond. The final disintegration step displayed
weight loss (obs = 37.20 and 37.10%, cal = 37.35 and 37.18%) in the
temperature range 380–650 °C, corresponding to the loss
of the remaining part of organic moieties. Finally, horizontal lines
in TGA curves above 700 °C indicates no further weight loss,
suggesting the presence of metal oxide as a final residue in all the
compounds.7 The thermal analysis results
are in accordance with the outcomes of elemental analysis.

3 Biological Studies
3.1 DNA Binding
DNA
binding analysis
is considered to be one of the most crucial factors to examine the
feasibility of a number of anticancer drugs as it is the vital transporter
of genetic data related to the most cancers occurring via DNA damage.45 The binding of metal to DNA could occur by two
processes: either via covalent bonding in which the nitrogen base
of DNA replaces the labile metal ion or by noncovalent interactions
(electrostatic, intercalative, or groove binding of complexes to DNA
helix).43 Therefore, the interaction of
drug–DNA is vital for the coherent designing and development
of new DNA-targeted drugs.

3.1.1 Absorption Interaction
Studies
Electronic absorption spectroscopy (EAS) provides
a conducive platform
to inspect the way by which metal complexes bind with CT-DNA. In general,
bathochromic shift, hypsochromic shift, hyperchromic, and hypochromic
effect have been detected in the UV–visible spectra after binding
to DNA.27 The absorption titration of all
complexes (0–60 μM) were carried out (230–350
nm) at a fixed concentration of CT-DNA (60 μM) (Figure 4). After adding a variable
concentration of complexes (0–60 μM), the absorption
band at 260 nm exhibited enhancement in absorption intensity (hyperchromic)
accompanied by a significant red shift (bathochromic shift) of 2–3
nm. Hyperchromism observed in absorption spectra generally occurs
because of minor/major groove binding of complexes to DNA, which infers
that the unstacking and unwinding of the DNA double helix along with
the concomitant exposure of the bases provides numerous hydrogen bonding
sites which are easily available for both major and minor groove interactions.43 Thus, the spectral result suggests that the
interaction amidst the complexes with CT-DNA either occurs electrostatically
or through groove binding interaction.46 In our case, the hydroxyl group of naphthyl and acetophenone ring
interacts with the DNA base pair via hydrogen bonding. Therefore,
the preferable binding mode of the complex to the DNA helix will be
groove binding interaction.43 The observed
order of hyperchromic effect in complexes was found to be [(L1)2Cu] > [(L1)2Zn] > [(L2)Cu(H2O)] > [(L2)Zn(H2O)], which suggests that the
complexes of L1 framework have
comparatively better prospects to become an imperative chemotherapeutic
agent than L2 complexes because
of more aromatic nature, larger planarity, and greater biopotency.

of complexes (0–60 μM) [(L1)2Cu] (a), [(L1)2Zn] (b), [(L2)Cu(H2O)] (c),
and [(L2)Zn(H2O)] (d). Arrows show variation in
intensity with increasing concentration of complexes.

3.1.2 Steady-State Quenching
A steady-state
fluorescence quenching experiment was performed in the range 410–600
nm in order to ascertain the binding susceptibility of all complexes
with CT-DNA. The process of energy transfer, excited state reaction,
molecular rearrangement, as well as ground-state complex formation
is responsible for the phenomena of fluorescence quenching in the
fluorescent molecules.40 The fluorescence
quenching efficiency of complexes was evaluated from the Stern–Volmer
equation  F and F0—fluorescent
intensity of molecule with and without
quencher, respectively; Q—concentration of
quencher; and Ksv—quenching constant.

The results showed that on elevating the CT-DNA concentration (0–60
μM), there is a substantial decline in the fluorescence intensity
of each complex devoid of any remarkable shift in the emission wavelength.
The quenching pattern observed in the complexes is basically owing
to the formation of nonfluorescent adduct of complexes and DNA (Figure 5). To verify the
results, the ratio of maximum fluorescent intensity with and without
DNA (F0/F) was calculated
against the concentration of DNA, while the slope of this graph gives
the value of Ksv, and Figure 6 shows the linear Stern–Volmer
plot, which confirms the mode of binding either static or dynamic
in nature.47 The quenching mechanism was
further established by calculating the values of bimolecular quenching
rate constant (Kq).  τ0—average fluorescent
life time without a quencher (generally 10–8 s).

concentrations of DNA (0–60 μM). Arrow
shows changes in intensity with the elevation of DNA concentration.

of DNA with [(L1)2Cu] (a), [(L1)2Zn] (b), [(L2)Cu(H2O)] (c), and [(L2)Zn(H2O)] (d) complexes.

The values of Ksv and Kq were calculated (Table 2) by using the above equation. Apparently, Kq of all complexes, 2.94 × 1011[(L1)2Cu], 2.26 × 1011[(L1)2Zn], 1.79 × 1011[(L2)Cu(H2O)], and 9.80 × 1010[(L2)Zn(H2O)], showed greater values than the collision quenching
constant of biomolecules (2.0 × 1010 L mol–1 s–1), which unambiguously suggested the static
mode of quenching (Figure 7).48

3.1.3 Fluorescence Interaction
(EtBr and Hoechst)
In order to get further insight about
the interaction mode of complexes
with the CT-DNA, a fluorescence titration experiment was carried out
(450–700 nm) taking ethidium bromide (EB) as a fluorescent
probe. EB is a measure of intercalation, which can readily form soluble
complexes with nucleic acid that emits enhanced fluorescence owing
to the intercalation among adjacent base pairs on the double helix
of DNA.8,48 The increased fluorescence intensity of
EB gets markedly quenched upon addition of another molecule either
by the displacement of the EB or by acquiring the excited-state electron
of EB through a photoelectron-transfer mechanism.45 Therefore, an EB displacement technique provides a collateral
evidence for the modes of DNA binding.16 In Figure 8, the
increased concentration of complexes to DNA-bound EB did not exhibit
any change on the fluorescence intensity. These results ruled out
the probability of intercalative mode of binding, which further nullifies
the feasibility of replacing EB from the DNA–EB adduct. Therefore,
the possibility of groove binding mechanism was further checked by
using Hoechst displacement studies.48

spectra of DNA–EB adduct with varying concentrations
of complexes (0–60 μM) [(L1)2Cu] (a), [(L1)2Zn] (b), [(L2)Cu(H2O)] (c),
and [(L2)Zn(H2O)] (d).

The Hoechst displacement experiment was carried out in the range
360–600 nm. Hoechst is a minor groove binder and was known
to exhibit weak fluorescence because of quenching by the solvent molecule
in the free form. This weak fluorescence intensity of Hoechst increases
drastically upon binding with DNA.48 The
binding of the molecule to the minor groove of DNA leads to the replacement
of Hoechst from the DNA–Hoechst system, which is marked by
a gradual decrease in fluorescent intensity of the DNA–Hoechst
complex.47Figure 9 shows that on increasing the concentration
of complex to the DNA–Hoechst system, a substantial decline
in the fluorescence intensity was seen in all complexes. These results
suggested that the mode of binding is minor groove binding, and the
complex replaces the Hoechst from Hoechst DNA system in the order [(L1)2Cu] > [(L1)2Zn] > [(L2)Cu(H2O)] > [(L2)Zn(H2O)].

3.2 HSA Binding
3.2.1 UV
Absorption
EAS offers a consistent
approach to elucidate the structural modification of a protein and
its HSA–drug binding capability. The absorption spectrum of
HSA exhibited a peak at 220 nm due to which n−π* transition
is associated with peptide bond (alpha helix), whereas weak signals
at 278 nm correspond to the π–π* transition of
aromatic acid (phenyl rings) residues.43 The hypochromic effect in the HSA spectra (Figure 10) was observed upon incremental addition
of complex concentration (0–10 μM) to a constant amount
of HSA (10 μM). This indicates the exposure of aromatic amino
acids residues of HSA in a hydrophobic void with an aqueous environment
after binding to the complexes. Also, occurrence of hypochromism in
the absorption spectra of HSA with increasing concentration of the
complexes infers the role of π–π stacking interactions
among the phenyl rings of aromatic acid residues and aromatic rings
of the compound.49 The observed trend of
hypochromic effect is [(L1)2Cu] > [(L1)2Zn] > [(L2)Cu(H2O)] > [(L2)Zn(H2O)], suggesting the greater binding tendency and better conjugation
of L1-based complexes as compared
to L2 complexes.

varying concentrations (0–10 μM) of complexes [(L1)2Cu] (a), [(L1)2Zn] (b), [(L2)Cu(H2O)] (c), and [(L2)Zn(H2O)] (d).

3.2.2 Fluorescence Quenching
HSA occurs
abundantly in the plasma and plays an imperative role by regulating
the osmotic pressure. It exhibited an outstanding binding property,
storage, as well as transportation of many endogenous and exogenous
compounds. Therefore, interaction of drugs with HSA helps in better
interpretation of protein–drug complex properties. It may also
give significant information regarding transportation, absorption,
distribution, as well as drug metabolism. Fluorescence spectroscopy
imparts an eminent role in elucidating the interactions between the
receptor and metal complexes. HSA displays fluorescence owing to the
occurrence of these fluorophores (tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenyl
alanine residues) among which the tryptophan residue exclusively contributes
to the intrinsic fluorescence.50 The fluorescence
quenching happened to take place when the molecules excited (295 nm)
and bind particularly to albumin in the region comprising Trp 214
residue.51,52 Upon gradual increment in the concentration
of complexes (0–10 μM) to a fixed amount of HSA (10 μM),
there is a sequential decline in the intrinsic fluorescence intensity
of HSA at 340 nm (Figure 11). From the results, it is quite evident that all the complexes
significantly show quenching and follows the order-[(L1)2Cu] > [(L1)2Zn] > [(L2)Cu(H2O)] > [(L2)Zn(H2O)]. These quenching outcomes
illustrate that the protein-binding affinity of each complex induces
a conformational change in HSA as the intramolecular forces associated
in maintaining the secondary structure can be modulated together with
decreased hydrophobicity, indicating the more exposure of Trp residues
to solvent.51−53 Basically, quenching process can be widely categorized
into dynamic and static type. In dynamic quenching mechanism, the
diffusion includes transfer of energy and molecular collision, which
is stimulated by a high range of temperature, while in the case of
static quenching, the compound formed by protein and complexes becomes
disrupted at higher temperatures. Therefore, both of these quenching
phenomena can be differentiated easily by their different temperature
dependences. Furthermore, the probable mechanism of HSA in the presence
of complex can be elucidated using the Stern–Volmer (S–V)
plot  F and F0—fluorescence intensities
of HSA with and without quencher,
respectively; Ksv—a Stern–Volmer
quenching constant; Kq—quenching
rate constant of the biomolecules; τ—average life time
of the molecule without a quencher (δ0 = 10–8 s); and Q—concentration of the quencher.

quenching measurement assay of HSA (10 μM) with
varying concentrations of complexes (0–10 μM) [(L1)2Cu] (a), [(L1)2Zn] (b), [(L2)Cu(H2O)] (c), and [(L2)Zn(H2O)] (d).

Figure 12 shows
the Stern–Volmer plots for quenching of HSA fluorescence, and
the values of Ksv and Kb were calculated (Table 3). The value of Kq was
found to be greater compared to the limiting diffusion constant of
the biomolecules (Kdiff = 2.0 × 1010 M–1 s–1), suggesting
that the quenching happened owing to the interaction of HSA with a
complex which corroborates the static quenching mechanism.54 The binding constant (Kb) was calculated using the modified Stern–Volmer equation  F and F0—fluorescence intensities of HSA with
and without quencher,
respectively; Kb—binding constant;
and n—number of binding sites per molecule
of HSA.

[(L2)Zn(H2O)]	3.74 × 104	1.58 × 103	1.58 × 1011	0.9791	
The value of binding constant Kb was
evaluated from the intercept of the graph (Figure 13) and was found to be 4.62 × 104[(L1)2Cu], 1.20 × 103[(L1)2Zn], 5.13 × 103[(L2)Cu(H2O)], and 1.58 × 103[(L2)Zn(H2O)] (Table 3). The Kb values of L1-based complexes were found to be 4.26 ×
104 and 1.20 × 104, which are physiologically
favorable (104 to 106 M–1)
for any drug carrier in the blood.40 These
results showed that L1-based
complexes are potential avid binder and interacts with the HSA more
firmly as compared to L2 complexes,
making them a potential bioactive entity for HSA. This striking bioactivity
of L1 complexes was owing to
the occurrence of high planarity and extended conjugation of naphthaldehyde
ring (π–π conjugation) as compared to acetophenone
ring. Moreover, the presence of π–π interaction
in L1-based complexes provides
better insight into the mechanism of drug activity7 and showed more quenching responses than other complexes.
The outcome of the present study revealed that the Cu complex of ligand
(L1) has sound activity than
other complexes as it depends on the nature of the metal present in
the complex, chelate effect, and the nature of ligand, that is, the
complex with the drug as ligand is expected to be more potent. Thus,
the importance of metal ion is crucial in conjunction with bioactive
ligand scaffold. In literature, a plethora of copper complexes with
diverse ligands has been fully reviewed, which show significant biological
activity.51,55,56 Hence, biorelevant
metal atoms such as Cu and simultaneous coexistence of potential synergetic
effect of bioactive ligand scaffold, here L1, presented pronounced activity with regard to its
structural feature.

fluorescence

3.2.3 Förster Resonance Energy Transfer
FRET is the type of phenomenon based on interaction of excited
molecule with its adjacent molecule. The transfer of energy between
the complex and HSA can be explained by this theory. It involves transfer
of absorbed energy from the donor molecule to the receptor molecule
(Figure 14).57 It is considered as a nonradiative distance-based
process which involves flow of excitation energy from the donor moiety
(protein) to the receptor moiety (complex) in the ground state. The
emission spectra of donor molecules superimposes with the absorption
profile of the acceptor molecule.57 According
to the FRET theory, the energy transfer pathway is regulated by the
mentioned criterion; the distance (must lie under 7 nm) between the
donor and acceptor, efficient spectral overlay between the donor (fluorescence
emission) and the acceptor (absorption) and the high fluorescence
quantum yield of the donor molecule. The energy-transfer (E) value can be evaluated by using the equation57  F and F0—fluorescence intensities (HSA) with and without complex,
respectively; r—the distance in between the
acceptor and donor molecule; and R0—critical
distance when the efficiency of energy transfer is 50%, which can
be evaluated by using equation  K2—orientation
factor associated with the dipoles; n—the
average refractive index value of medium; ⌀—fluorescence quantum yield of the donor; J—extent of spectral overlap of donor (fluorescence) and acceptor
(absorbance).

Figure 14 FRET of HSA with [(L1)2Cu] (a), [(L1)2Zn] (b), [(L2)Cu(H2O)] (c),
and [(L2)Zn(H2O)] (d) complexes.

The value of J can be obtained by using
the equation.  F(λ)—donor
fluorescence
intensity at wavelength (λ), and ε(λ)—molar
absorptivity coefficient of the acceptor at wavelength (λ).

Here, ⌀, n, and K2 were considered to be 0.118, 1.336, and 2/3,
respectively, and the values of E, J, R0, and r are mentioned
in Table 4. In general,
the distance between the bound complex and tryptophan residue is less
than 7 nm, which undoubtedly deciphers the occurrence of radiationless
energy-transfer mechanism for quenching.57 Moreover, all the complexes have r values <8
nm and in the range “0.5 R0 < r < 1.5 R0”, indicating
the transfer of energy from HSA to complexes. Also, the values of r are higher than those of R0, suggesting the occurrence of static quenching process upon binding.58 As evaluated from this study, the magnitude
of short distance amid the bound complex and tryptophan residue inferred
the significant HSA–complex interaction.

3.2.4 HSA Cleavage Activity
To obtain
information regarding the capability of [(L1)2Cu] complex acting as a photoactivated chemotherapeutic agent, HSA photocleavage
assay was performed. The photoinduced cleavage activity was carried
out using SDS-PAGE electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gel. From Figure 15a, it is clearly
observed that HSA in the absence of [(L1)2Cu] complex
(lane 1) shows no significant cleavage. However, on substantial increase
of [(L1)2Cu] complex concentration (100–300
μM), HSA displayed prominent cleavage activity along with remarkable
splitting of band (lanes 2, 3, and 4), which further fades away (lanes
5 and 6), suggesting the complete photocleavage upon irradiation (Figure 15a). To further
confirm the mechanistic approach of photocleavage, comparative HSA
cleavage assay was done in the presence of various hydroxyl radical
scavengers (OH.). It is illustrated well that no significant
change was observed in the photocleavage activity of [(L1)2Cu] complex (Figure 15b) in the presence of KI and DMSO (lanes 7 and 8), which infers
the noninvolvement of singlet oxygen as a reactive species in HSA
cleavage. On the other hand, introduction of standard superoxide scavenger
[NaN3, superoxide dismutase (SOD)] leads to the remarkable
inhibition of the cleavage activity (lane 9) of [(L1)2Cu] complex. This result revealed that the HSA cleavage assay
follows the photoinduced oxidative cleavage pathway.43

4 Docking
To further
validate the spectroscopic results and to envisage the
desired orientation of the [(L1)2Cu] complex,
molecular docking study was carried out using the DNA duplex of sequence
d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2 dodecamer (PDB 1D: 1BNA) (Figure 16). The computer-aided molecular
modeling techniques give the chiral preference as well as energetically
most stable conformation of the docked molecule [(L1)2Cu], which fits perfectly in the G–C region of the
minor groove DNA target. This optimal minor groove binding facilitates
the formation of the least sterically hindered conformation of complex
1 with the DNA.45 The resulting docked
pose gives the value of binding −239.06 kJ/mol, which further
substantiates the potential binding propensity of [(L1)2Cu] complex with DNA. The more the negative value of binding
energy, the better the binding tendency of the complex will be. Thus,
these molecular docking results further compliment the spectroscopic
observation. Similarly, the imine-based [(L1)2Cu] complex was subjected to docking with another protein sequence target-HSA
(PDB ID: 1h9z) (Figure 17). The
crystalline study of HSA revealed that it is composed of three homologous
domains (I, II, and III): I (residues 1–195), II (196–383),
and III (384–585). These three domains along with two subdomains
(A and B) assemble together to form a heart-shaped structure.59 In HSA, the primary region of binding is located
inside the hydrophobic voids of subdomains IIA and IIIA, which correspond
to site I and II and tryptophan residue (Trp 214) in subdomain IIA.60 The molecular docked model of [(L1)2Cu] complex and HSA showed the location of complex in hydrophobic
cavity of IIA domain of HSA and one-half is submerged in the adjacent
hydrophobic residue Glu 292, Val 293, Cys 289, Glu 294, and Ala 291
of subdomain IIA of HSA, inferring the occurrence of hydrophobic interactions
among them (Figure 17). Thus, the result provides an apt confirmation to substantiate
the efficient fluorescence quenching of HSA emission by the [(L1)2Cu] complex. Additionally, there are electrostatic
interaction and hydrogen bonding between various polar and ion groups
in the vicinity of the molecule such as ARG 117, ARG 186, ILE 142,
and TYR 161. These interactions further stabilize the molecule. Therefore,
the results of molecular docking give insights into the mode of binding
of the compound with DNA and HSA along with the conformational constraints
for complex formation.

5 Antioxidant Activity
Schiff base compounds are known
to significant antioxidant activity.61 ROS
produced various biochemical processes which
impart deleterious effects on human health.40 Specifically, imines having ortho hydroxy groups acted effectively
in scavenging the free radicals and lead to the development of biopotential
and effective drugs.7 The scavenging effect
of compounds was explored to investigate the antioxidant behavior
by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and SOD mimetics under standard
reaction conditions using ascorbic acid as a control. The data of
DPPH and SOD mimetics at varying concentrations (0–200 μM)
are given in Table 5 (Figure 18).

5.1 Scavenging Activity by DPPH
The DPPH
radical scavenging activity was calculated in terms of IC50 and occurs basically because of the hydrogen/electron donating ability
of DPPH. The liberation of hydrogen leads to a color change from purple
to yellow. The scavenging data revealed that L1-based complexes have more pronounced antioxidant activity
than L2. The results also suggested
that chelated metal complexes are more efficient scavengers than their
respective free ligands. The redox attributes and the coordination
environment of complexes are the two important factors responsible
for the variation in the scavenging activities.16 It is given that redox properties depend on various criteria,
namely, extent of unsaturation in the chelate ring, size of chelate
ring, and axial ligation.62 The enhanced
scavenging performance of complexes is due to the occurrence of azomethine
group, which liberates H+ easily upon binding.16 A number of reports have appeared in literature
where the metal complexes have been shown to act as a better antioxidant
in comparison to ligands. The comparative antioxidant activity has
been explained in terms of chelation effect of imines as well as the
influence of metal ions.63−65

5.2 SOD Mimetics
The eradication of superoxide
anion(O2–) and hydroxyl radical(OH–) is extremely important as they give rise to the number
of diseases.40 It is earlier reported in
literature that complexes possessing O and N donor bidentate ligands
have better reactivity for dioxygen.66 Therefore,
scavenging effects on superoxide anion radical were carried out in
terms of IC50 (Table 5). The obtained data suggested that complexes exhibited
superior scavenging effect in comparison to their respective imine
moieties [(L1)2Cu] > [(L1)2Zn] > [(L2)Cu(H2O)] > [(L2)Zn(H2O)].

6 Conclusions
In the
pursuit of designing biocompatible chemotherapeutic drug
entities, we have synthesized four imine-based monometallic complexes
{[(L1)2Cu], [(L1)2Zn], [(L2)Cu(H2O)], and [(L2)Zn(H2O)]} and
systematically characterized by spectral and thermal techniques. The
comparative binding affinities of all the synthesized complexes with
CT-DNA and HSA were performed using biophysical studies (absorption
and emission). The relative results of DNA/HSA binding studies suggested
that L1 acted as a superior avid
binder as its complexes have demonstrated higher biopotency than L2-based complexes. The photocleavage
assay also revealed that [(L1)2Cu] complex exhibited
appreciable photocleavage activity, which makes it a potential photoactivated
chemotherapeutic agent. Moreover, the software-assisted molecular
docking study (DNA/HSA) further validates the effective binding of
the [(L1)2Cu] complex to the G–C-rich minor
groove of DNA helix and hydrophobic cavity of IIA domain of HSA. The
targeted approach (hybrid pharmacophore) of our work involves successful
intervention of biologically active metal ions into the domain of
biorelevant pharmacophores (L1 and L2), which can be explored
for in vivo applications as chemotherapeutic in future.

260 and 280 nm, which provided a ratio of about 1:1.8, to get an idea
of the presence of CT-DNA free from protein. Absorption spectroscopy
at 260 nm was employed to unravel the CT-DNA concentration per nucleotide,
taking molar extinction coefficient of 6600 M–1 cm–1 (after 1:100 dilution).71 The aliquots of CT-DNA were incubated at 4 °C for further use
in experimental assays.

7.3.1 UV–Visible Interaction
The
absorption titration was performed using a UV–1800 Shimadzu
spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 230–350 nm at
a fixed amount of CT-DNA (60 μM) while altering the concentrations
of the complexes in the range of 0–60 μM. In order to
eliminate the noise obtained because of the absorbance of CT-DNA,
an equal amount of CT-DNA was added to the control as well as complex
solution during titration.

7.3.2 Fluorescence Quenching
Interaction
The fluorescence quenching mechanism was performed
by titration using
a Shimadzu spectrophotometer-5301PC assembled with a constant temperature
holder. This holder was connected to the Neslab RTE-110 water bath
having a precision of ±0.1 °C. The excitation wavelength
of the complexes was set at 390, 390, 320, and 322 nm for [(L1)2Cu], [(L1)2Zn], [(L2)Cu(H2O)], and [(L2)Zn(H2O)] complexes, respectively, while
their emission spectra were obtained in the range 300–600 nm.
The slit widths were set to 10 nm each. The fluorescence quenching
experiment was performed by taking a constant concentration (60 μM)
of complexes and variable concentrations of CT-DNA (0–60 μM).
Each time, 20 μL was added to avoid any change in volume.

7.3.3 Displacement Assay
A Shimadzu model
RF-5301 spectrofluorometer was employed to investigate the interactions
of complexes to dye-bound CT-DNA in Tris-HCl buffer (10 Mm), pH 7.2.
Two dyes were used for this purpose (EB, Hoechst). The emission and
excitation wavelength for each dye was set distinctly while measuring
the intrinsic fluorescence. The emission wavelength was recorded in
the range of 520–700 nm while the excitation wavelength was
set at 476 nm for the EB–DNA complex. In the case of Hoechst
33258-DNA complex, the excitation spectra were set at 343 nm, and
the emission was obtained in the range of 375–600 nm. The concentration
of complexes was altered from 0 to 60 μM, whereas DNA concentration
(60 μM) was kept fixed during the displacement assays.

7.4 HSA Binding
The stock solution of
HSA was made by dissolving 20 mg of HSA in 1 mL of 100 mM phosphate
buffer at pH 7.4. The concentration (HSA) was determined at 278 nm
by UV–vis spectroscopy, taking the molar extinction coefficient
as 35,700 M–1 cm–1.49 The complexes were also dissolved in 100 mM
phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4).

7.4.1 UV–Visible
Interaction
Spectrophotometric
analysis of HSA was performed on a UV–1800 Shimadzu spectrophotometer
in a cuvette of 1 cm path length. The absorption was measured taking
different amounts of complexes (0–10 μM) and a constant
concentration of HSA (10 μM) in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH
7.4) within the range of 240–340 nm.

7.4.2 Fluorescence
Quenching Interaction
Fluorescence experiments were performed
on a Shimadzu spectroflurometer-5301
assembled with fixed temperature control via fluorometric titration.
The excitation spectra were recorded at 295 nm, while the emission
spectra were obtained (310–450 nm) on a dual-path length fluorescence.
The slit widths were fixed to 10 nm for recording both spectra. Afterward,
fluorescence titration studies were performed by taking a fixed content
of HSA (10 μM) against variable concentrations (0–10
μM) of complexes. Each time, 10 μL was added to avoid
any change in volume.

7.4.3 Förster Resonance
Energy Transfer
Similarly, the absorption spectra of complexes
and the HSA were
determined as mentioned in the absorption and emission section (300–400
nm). The energy transfer depends upon the efficient overlap between
the donor (HSA) and acceptor (complex) spectra and the Förster
distance between them.

7.4.4 HSA Cleavage
The HSA photocleavage
performance was assessed via SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (10% polyacrylamide
gel) to assess the capability of the [(L1)2Cu] complex
to function as a synthetic metalloprotease. The photoexposure to UV-A1
light (at 365 nm and for 25 min) by[(L1)2Cu] complex
led to the photocleavage of HSA (15 μM) in Tris–HCl buffer,
pH 7.4, at the various concentrations (0–300 μM).43

7.5 Docking
The molecular
docking was
carried via HEX 6.1 software.59 The structure
of the synthesized [(L1)2Cu] complex was illustrated
with the help of ChemDraw 12.0 software and adapted to pdb setup employing
Mercury software (htttp://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/). The structure of the B-DNA dodecamer d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2 (PDB ID: 1BNA) and HSA (PDB ID: 1h9z) was acquired from the protein data bank. The docked pose was visualized
using Discovery Studio molecular graphic program and CHIMERA.
