We carried out a density functional
theory study to investigate
the adsorption behavior of four kinds of SF6 decomposed
products over the ZnO(101̅0) surface. The effects of O and Zn
vacancies on the surface were also considered. For perfect ZnO(101̅0)
surface, the adsorption of SO2 and H2S exhibits
stronger chemical interactions compared to the adsorption of SOF2 and SO2F2. For SO2 and H2S adsorption, there may exist new chemical bond formation
between the molecule and the surface and the H2S molecule
experiences one H–S broken bond. The introduction of O vacancy
cannot obviously enhance the chemical interactions between these four
molecules and the surface. However, the Zn vacancy on the surface
can significantly elevate the chemical interactions between SO2/H2S and the surface. The two-coordinated O atom
(O2c) on the surface plays an important role. For SO2 and H2S adsorption, the S atom in SO2 or H2S tends to bond to the O2c atom, bringing
much larger adsorption energy compared to the adsorption over the
perfect ZnO(101̅0) surface. This work can provide a basis for
surface modification of ZnO in applications to detecting SF6 decomposed products by theoretical evaluation.

1 Introduction
Semiconductor-type
metal oxide nanomaterials have unique chemical
and physical properties, including high specific surface area, high
surface activity, and better optical properties. These excellent properties
make them promising candidates in fields of catalyst,1−3 energy storage and energy conversion,4−6 gas sensor and biosensor,7−10 electrical and optical devices,11 and
antibacterial technology.12 Typically,
because ZnO has an approximate band gap of about 3.37 eV with exciting
binding energy of about 60 meV, is low cost, and possesses chemical
stability, excellent optical properties, and high activity to some
typical gases, it has been widely used as gas-sensing materials.8 ZnO exhibits n-type semiconductor properties
if no other impurity atoms are doped due to the inevitable oxygen
vacancy produced during the synthetic process. Also, the introduction
of highly active sites by impurity atoms can significantly promote
the gas-sensing properties of some typical gases. The mechanism of
ZnO based gas sensor is the changes of the conductivity if ZnO is
exposed to different types of detected gases and different concentrations.
After obtaining the conductivity of the sensing materials, the type
and concentration of the detected gases can be evaluated. On the basis
of the results of many scholars, it was found that ZnO has unique
sensing properties to H2S, reaching 1 ppb concentration
of the detection limit.13,14 The high response to
H2S will make ZnO promising gas-sensing materials for hazardous
gas detection and have potential value in protecting human health
in some areas. The mechanism of several metal oxide gas-sensing materials
has also been widely studied qualitatively, including SnO2, ZnO, WO3, In2O3, etc. The sensing
properties mainly depend on the adsorption and dissociation of O2 on the surface. The oxygen species can exist on the surface
with multiple categories, including O2–, O–, O2–, etc. The proportion
of these species is determined by the ambient temperature, and the
sensing properties rely highly on the settled temperature and the
oxidation process of the detected gas molecule.7−10 However, these kinds of explanation
could not be used to evaluate the adsorption process of the detected
gas molecules before oxidation. As a result, theoretical evaluation
by the first-principle method has been extensively adopted to assess
the adsorption as well as gas-sensing properties of some popular gas-sensing
materials, such as metal oxide, carbon-based materials (graphene and
carbon nanotubes), transitional metal dichalcogenides, etc. To better
understand the sensing mechanism of ZnO-based materials, theoretical
method using the first-principle-based method is an effective and
accurate way.

ZnO exhibits its chemically stable hexagonal wurtzite
structure.15 Every Zn is bonded to four
ambient O atoms with
a tetrahedral form. The valence state of Zn is Zn2+, whereas
that of O is O2–. Diebold et al. systematically
investigated the surfaces and interfaces of ZnO using high-resolution
scanning tunneling microscopy. ZnO mainly has five typical low-index
surfaces, including (101̅0), (112̅0), (0001̅), (0001),
and (112̅1). The (101̅0) and (112̅0) surfaces were
proved to be nonpolarized prism surfaces, whereas the (0001̅)
and (0001) surfaces are c-oriented polarized and
the (112̅1) surface is the pyramid face.16 Different surfaces have different chemical activities,
and several studies have achieved gas adsorption and surface reaction
on different ZnO surfaces by the first-principles method.

Fink
et al. studied the adsorption behaviors of H2,
CO, and CO2 over the (0001̅) surface considering
the influence of oxygen vacancies. The (0001̅) surface can be
stabilized by OH groups, and CO2 prefers to dissociate
to CO+O over the O vacancy, which can have potential application in
CO2 conversion reaction.17 Prades
et al. made a comprehensive study of the gas-sensing properties of
nonpolar (101̅0) and (112̅0) toward SO2 and
NO2 by an ab initio study. NO2 is easy to be
adsorbed onto Zn, and two surfaces are easy to be poisoned by SO2.18 The adsorption and dissociation
processes of H2S on the (101̅0) surface were investigated
by Wang et al., and the dissociation process is easy to happen and
the final product S atom can be stably adsorbed on the O vacancy.19 The CO2 catalytic fixation process
on different surfaces was studied by Tang et al., and the binding
strength is the inverse of the stability of the chosen surface.20 Not only that, the (101̅0) or (0001) surface
can be an effective medium for urea adsorption and decomposition,21 methanol reaction or other organic reaction,22−24 and small-molecule adsorption.25,26 More than
the specified crystal indices, the metal oxide nanoparticles were
also used to evaluate the gas-sensing properties. By doping N atom
on the surface, the cohesive energy between the O3/NO2 molecule and the ZnO nanoparticle can be significantly increased.27 Not only for ZnO, the method of using nanoclusters
in place of infinite specific surface structures has also been applied
to other metal oxides such as TiO2 and for heterojunction
structures. The doping of N atom on TiO2 nanoparticles
can obviously improve the gas-sensing properties to NO2, and the synthesis of heterojunction structures with MoS2 and WSe2 can have high response to some specific gases
such as SOx, NOx, or ozone.28−30 With so many theoretical studies of surface adsorption
and surface interaction of typical metal oxide gas sensors, they have
future potential application in many fields such as detecting SF6 decomposed products.

In the field of electrical engineering,
detecting SF6 by application of gas-sensing materials has
become an effective
and low-cost way to obtain the operation status of equipment. To detect
typical SF6 decompositions, including SO2, SOF2, SO2F2, and H2S, metal oxide
and its composed material-based gas sensor have drawn more and more
attention, such as SnO2,31,32 ZnO,33,34 TiO2, etc.35,36 However, the mechanism
of gas-sensing properties of ZnO to SF6 decomposition products
has seldom been systematically studied quantitatively by theoretical
approach. Although many studies have discussed the sensing properties
of ZnO(0001) to several kinds of gases, we chose ZnO(101̅0)
in this study for two typical reasons. First, the stability level
of ZnO(101̅0) is obviously higher than that of other surfaces
including ZnO(112̅0) and ZnO(0001) surfaces because of the lower
surface formation energy.20 It demonstrated
that the ZnO(101̅0) surface can be more easily obtained in experiment.
Second, most of the nanowire ZnO gas sensors expose lateral nonpolar
surfaces such as ZnO(101̅0) and ZnO(112̅0).18 Comparing the formation energies of ZnO(101̅0)
and ZnO(112̅0), we chose the lower one to discuss the adsorption
and gas-sensing properties in this work to investigate the chemical
performance of ZnO surface to SF6 decomposed products.
We considered the effect of both O vacancy and Zn vacancy on the surface.
First, the adsorption structures of four types of SF6 decomposed
products on the perfect and defective ZnO surface were obtained. Then,
the electronic properties of the ZnO surface before and after adsorbing
different gas molecules were analyzed including electron transfer,
charge density difference (CDD), electron localization function (ELF),
and density of states (DOS). The adsorption properties to different
gas molecules were compared. On the basis of theoretical evaluation
of adsorption properties, the investigation of the sensing mechanism
can shed light on future applications of new types of ZnO and its
composite material-based gas-sensing material in detecting SF6 decomposition.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structure of ZnO(101̅0) Surface and
the Formation of O and Zn Vacancies
As is mentioned in Section 2, the top layer
of ZnO(101̅0) surface contains Zn3c, Zn4c, O3c, and O4c. After full geometric optimization
(the two bottom layers were constrained), it can be seen in Figure 1 that the O3c atoms are more protuberant compared to the Zn3c atoms.
When removing one O3c atom out of the ZnO(101̅0)
surface, one Zn3c turns to two-coordinated Zn atom (Zn2c) and two Zn4c change to three-coordinated Zn
atoms (Zn3c), as shown in Figure 1b. The Zn2c atom moves right to
the O vacancy, and the distance between two new-formed Zn3c atoms becomes smaller than the original two Zn4c atoms.
In summary, with the formation of one O vacancy on the ZnO(101̅0)
surface, three adjacent Zn atoms are closer to each other. With respect
to the formation energy of one O vacancy under different circumstances,
the results are listed in Table 1. It should be noted that when considering the van
der Waals (vdW) force calculated using the DFT-D2 method, all the
structures used in eq 1 include the DFT-D2 correction. But without considering the vdW force,
all the structures are not corrected by the DFT-D2 method. The formation
of these two vacancy defects is both an endothermic process. Under
a Zn-rich environment, the surface O vacancy is easy to appear. The
formation energy is only +0.39 eV considering the DFT-D2 method and
+0.29 eV without the DFT-D2 method. But under the O-rich environment,
the O vacancy is much more difficult to form compared to the formation
under Zn-rich circumstances. The formation energy elevates to +2.91
eV (including vdW force) and +2.73 eV (without vdW force). As to the
formation of Zn vacancy, if the synthesis condition is Zn rich, the
formation of Zn vacancy on the surface is very difficult. It exhibits
+3.70 eV (considering DFT-D2) and +3.46 eV (without DFT-D2) for a
Zn-rich environment, and if the environment is O rich, the formation
of Zn vacancy on the surface is much easier, only +1.17 and +1.05
eV if considering DFT-D2 and not considering it, respectively. By
comparing the formation energies for two kinds of vacancy defect under
different environments, it can be seen that the formation of surface
O vacancy under a Zn-rich environment is the easiest. Moreover, the
formation of Zn vacancy is also relatively easier under an O-rich
environment. This phenomenon conforms to the gas-sensing experiments
of ZnO that the experimental synthesis of ZnO often contains more
O vacancy compared to Zn vacancy. However, on the basis of the calculation
of formation energy, because the effect of the synthesis environment
is much bigger than the type of surface vacancy (the formation energy
for one kind of vacancy has huge difference under different environments),
the formation of vacancy can be controlled by the synthesis environment.
Although the formation energy may have some deviation affected by
the vdW force, the results also can provide general guidance for synthesizing
ZnO gas-sensing materials with different vacancy defects.

To assess the active site of perfect
and defective ZnO(101̅0)
surfaces, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) isosurfaces were calculated, as
shown in Figure 2.
The morphology of HOMO–LUMO has great influence on the adsorption
properties. The HOMO of the perfect ZnO(101̅0) surface mainly
locates near the O3c atoms, whereas the LUMO is mainly
around both the O3c atoms and the Zn3c atoms.
As a result, the active sites of the ZnO(101̅0) surface are
both the O3c atoms and the Zn3c atoms. For ZnO(101̅0)
surface containing one O vacancy, it can be seen that beside the same
active sites as the perfect ZnO(101̅0) surface, the LUMO appears
around the Zn2c atom. Also, the O vacancy can weaken the
activity of other O3c atoms because of the smaller isosurface.
As to the Zn vacancy, the HOMO–LUMO nearly does not appear
near the vacancy site, but the activity of some O3c atoms
may be elevated.

2.2 SF6 Decomposed Products Adsorbed
on Perfect ZnO(101̅0) Surface
Before proceeding with
the adsorption process, we first calculated the molecular orbitals
of four kinds of SF6 decomposed products (SO2, SOF2, SO2F2, and H2S). SO2 totally has 32 electrons, forming 16 bonding orbitals.
The 16th molecular orbital of SO2 is the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO), whereas the 17th molecular orbital is the
antibonding orbital as well as the lowest occupied molecular orbital
(LOMO). The corresponding energy ranges of some molecular orbitals
are shown in Figure 8a. As to the SOF2, there exists totally 21 bonding molecular
orbitals (42 electrons). As is shown in Figure 8c, in the range from −10 to 0 eV,
there are several molecular orbitals from the 12th to 21st. These
orbitals are separated in energy for SOF2. The SO2F2 has 21 bonding molecular orbitals, and the corresponding
energy is shown in Figure 8e. The H2S exhibits 9 bonding molecular orbitals,
as shown in Figure 8g. There are four separated molecular orbitals in the range from
−13 to 0 eV. By comparing the DOS of the isolated molecule
and adsorbed molecule, the chemical interactions can be evaluated
to some extent. When carrying out the adsorption process, the initial
adsorption position and adsorption direction were first set. The adsorption
position for the gas molecule over the perfect ZnO(101̅0) surface
is mainly two sites (the top of Zn3c (TZn) and
the top of O3c (TO)). The different directions
of the adsorbed gas molecule are also considered. There are three
directions for SO2 and H2S (parallel to the
surface and vertical to the surface with S downward and S upward)
and two directions for SOF2 (S upward and S downward) and
SO2F2 (one O upward and one F upward). After
obtaining several adsorption structures with the local minimum total
energy, only the adsorption structures with the maximum adsorption
energy for every gas molecule were considered to further discuss the
structure parameters, adsorption parameters, electronic properties,
and chemical interactions. The DFT-D2 method was considered in all
adsorption structures. All the obtained adsorption structures with
the local minimum total energy are shown in Figure S1 with adsorption energy comparison.

The adsorption
structures with the maximum adsorption energy for the gas molecule
over the perfect ZnO(101̅0) surface are shown in Figure 3. The SO2 prefers
to be adsorbed on the TO site with the molecule nearly
parallel to the surface. The distance between the gas molecule is
1.96 Å (S–O3c), much larger than the bond length
of S–O in the isolated SO2 molecule (about 1.48
Å). So the interaction between the S (in SO2) and
O3c is weaker than the S–O bonding interaction in
SO2. For SOF2, the adsorption site is the same
as the adsorption of SO2 (TO site), but the
distance is much longer (2.29 Å between S and O3c).
As to the adsorption of SO2F2, the adsorption
distance is even longer. The distance between the S atom (in SO2F2) and the O3c atom reaches 2.81 Å,
much larger than that of the adsorption of SO2 and SOF2. The adsorption of the above three molecules does not show much
morphology change of the gas molecule, and there is no obvious bond
breakage in the gas molecule. However, the adsorption of H2S has some differences. One H atom in H2S moves very close
to one O3c atom, and one H–S bond is significantly
longer, from about 1.36 to 2.03 Å. The adsorption distance is
much smaller than the above three gas molecules, only 1.03 Å
between the H atom and the O3c atom. This phenomenon in
this study is in accordance with the former report by other scholars.19 The bond broken process does not show obvious
energy barrier, and the adsorption process of H2S is a
spontaneous process. The adsorption parameters of these four gas molecules
adsorbed over the perfect ZnO(101̅0) surface are shown in Table 2. It can be seen that
the adsorption of H2S exhibits the largest adsorption energy,
reaching −1.64 eV. This phenomenon may be attributed to the
released energy from the possible formation of the new H–O
bond. The adsorption energy for SO2 is smaller compared
to H2S but larger than that of SOF2 and SO2F2. We estimated that the strength of the chemical
interaction between the surface and the molecule may be partially
relevant to the adsorption distance, so the shorter distance may bring
larger adsorption energy. As to the electron transfer, four molecules
all accept electrons, and the value of electron transfer for SO2 is the largest. We estimate that although H2S
shows the largest adsorption energy and new bond formation, the formation
bond may not bring much electron transfer. However, for SOF2 and SO2F2, the distance is much longer and
the interactions are much weaker, so the adsorption does not bring
much electron transfer.

products over
the perfect ZnO(101̅0) surface: (a) SO2, (b) SOF2, (c) SO2F2, and (d) H2S.

2.84 (S–O3c)	
H2S	–1.64	–0.10	1.03 (H–O3c)	
The CDD and ELF configurations are
also discussed, as shown in Figure 4. There exists a
charge depletion region between the O3c and the S atom
but an obvious charge accumulation region above S and around O atoms
in SO2. A large charge depletion region can also be found
around the O3c atom. It can be seen that the electron accumulation
region mainly exists around SO2, whereas electron depletion
mainly happens around the O3c atom, resulting in the electron
acceptor role of the SO2 molecule. For SOF2 and
SO2F2, there exists a small accumulation region
between the S atom and the O3c atom. However, the accumulation
and depletion mainly appear around the molecule, indicating that although
the adsorption does not bring obvious electron transfer between the
molecule and the surface, it exactly changes the electron distribution
and molecular orbitals of the molecule itself. For H2S
adsorption, large accumulation appears around the S atom and the depletion
region is around the O3c atom, reflecting the obvious electron-accepting
behavior of the S atom in H2S. As to the ELF configurations
in Figure 4e–h,
there exists a yellow region between the O3c and the S
atom, and the value of the yellow region is about 0.5–0.6.
This phenomenon demonstrates that electron pairs may exist between
these two atoms, resulting in a possible new-formed chemical bond
between the SO2 and the surface. However, for SOF2 and SO2F2 adsorption, a green or blue region
occurs between the adsorbed molecule and the surface, indicating much
lower possible new bond formation compared to the adsorption of SO2. For H2S adsorption, the H atom moves to the strong
electron localization region of the O3c atom, indicating
strong interactions between the H atom and the O3c atom.
In summary, the interactions between the surface and SO2/H2S are much stronger than the interactions between the
surface and SOF2/SO2F2. To discuss
the influence on the molecular orbitals by adsorption, DOS analysis
was also carried out.

Figure 4 (a)–(d) CDD configurations (the isosurface is 0.01
e Å–3) and (e)–(h) ELF configurations
of SF6 decomposed products adsorbed over the perfect ZnO(101̅0)
surface.

The molecular orbitals of SO2 exhibit new hybridization
and may form new orbitals among the previous 11th–16th orbitals,
as seen in Figure 9a, demonstrating significant redistribution of the electron structure
of the SO2 molecule. Moreover, in Figure 9b, obvious hybridization of S 3s, S 3p, O
2s, and O 2p orbitals near −10 eV and S 3p and O 2p orbitals
near −5, +3 eV can be found, indicating apparent chemical interactions
between the S and the O3c atom. As to the adsorbed SOF2 molecule, the redistribution
of the 16th–21st orbitals can be found. This phenomenon is
in accordance with the electron accumulation and depletion regions
in the SOF2 molecule itself. The hybridization of S 3p
and O 2p orbitals near −8, +3 eV can also be found, but the
degree is weaker than that of the adsorption of SO2. In Figure 9e, the height and
the width of the 22nd–25th peaks experience obvious change,
but these peaks are still detached with very little hybridization.
Moreover, a little hybridization of S 3p and O 2p orbitals is near
−7, +2.5 eV. For H2S adsorption, because the H2S molecule loses its former molecular structure, the 7th–9th
orbitals have tremendous changes with many new-formed orbitals, and
significant hybridization of H 1s, O 2s, and O 2p orbitals happens
near −8 eV. On the basis of the above analysis, for different
gas adsorptions, the adsorption brings different degrees of redistribution
of molecular orbitals to the adsorbed gas molecule and different orbital
hybridizations between the molecule and the O3c atom. One
thing that should be noted is that the DOS configurations of the gas
molecule often exhibit left shift, and this phenomenon is even more
obvious for SO2, SOF2, and SO2F2. The reason is that the Fermi level in the Dmol3 package is defined as the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
for the isolated gas molecule and the highest valence band for periodic
structure. The left shift can be attributed to the different energy
value of the HOMO of the molecule and the valence band of the ZnO
surface. The energy value of the HOMO of the gas molecule (especially
for SO2, SOF2, and SO2F2) is lower than that of the valence band of the ZnO surface. After
the adsorption, the Fermi level is defined as the highest valence
band of the new adsorption structure, which is very different from
the HOMO of the isolated molecule. In brief, the absolute energy value
of the “0 eV” of the isolated gas molecule and the adsorbed
gas molecule is different, resulting in the visual left shift.

2.3 SF6 Decomposed Products Adsorbed
on the ZnO(101̅0) Surface with O Vacancy
In this section,
we consider the effect of surface O vacancy on the adsorption of SF6 decomposition products. The initial adsorption directions
for the gas molecule were set the same as the adsorption over the
perfect ZnO(101̅0) surface. The initial adsorption sites were
set as only the top of the vacancy site (TV) to compare
the difference with the adsorption on the perfect ZnO(101̅0)
surface. All the adsorption structures with the local minimum total
energy are shown in Figure S2. As is mentioned
above, the adsorption structures with the maximum adsorption energy
of every molecule were chosen for detailed discussion (as listed in Table 3). For SO2 adsorption, it can be seen in Figure 5a that SO2 prefers to be adsorbed on the
top of the adjacent O3c atom site, and the adsorption distance
is a little shorter, only 1.72 Å, compared to the adsorption
on the perfect ZnO(101̅0) surface (1.96 Å). This value
is still much larger than the bond length of S–O in the SO2 molecule (1.48 Å). The SOF2 and SO2F2 prefer to be still adsorbed on the top of one O3c atom, and for H2S, the gas molecule is not very
easy to be adsorbed on the top of the vacancy site. Compared to the
adsorption of H2S on the perfect ZnO(101̅0) surface,
the adsorption configuration is nearly the same. This phenomenon was
also proved by another study indicating that the adsorption energies
with one bond broken are nearly the same in perfect and O vacancy
surfaces.19 By comparing the adsorption
energy and electron transfer, the introduction of O vacancy does not
elevate the adsorption energy for all gas molecules. On the contrary,
the adsorption energies for SOF2 and SO2F2 decrease a little. As a result, the surface O vacancy does
not obviously enhance the interactions between the surface and the
SF6 decompositions. But the electron transfer is a little
larger than the adsorption on the perfect surface for SO2, which may bring better response.

SO2F2	–0.53	–0.03	2.83 (F–O3c)	
H2S	–1.65	–0.12	1.02 (H–O3c)	
On comparing the CDD and ELF configurations
for SO2,
SOF2, and SOF2 adsorptions on the perfect surface
and the O vacancy surface in Figures 4 and 6, they show nearly the
same configuration. As to the DOS configurations of molecular orbitals
and atomic orbitals in Figure 10, the morphology of the adsorbed molecules and the
hybridization of the atomic orbitals are also nearly the same, so
we do not repeatedly discuss them again. In summary, the introduction
of O vacancy does not obviously enhance the interactions between the
surface and the SF6 decomposed molecules. Only a little
larger electron transfer can be found.

2.4 SF6 Decomposed Products Adsorbed
on the ZnO(101̅0) Surface with Zn Vacancy
By introducing
one Zn vacancy on the surface, one O3c atom changes to
O2c atom and two O4c atoms become O3c atoms. After full geometric optimization, the O2c atom
is out of its initial position. It moves away from the vacancy, as
shown in Figure 1c.
The initial adsorption distances of the gas molecule are the same
as mentioned in Sections 2.2 and 2.3. The adsorption sites are
set as the top of the vacancy site (TV) and the top of
the O2c atom (TO). Moreover, the final adsorption
structures are chosen with the minimum total energy (maximum adsorption
energy), as shown in Figure 7 and Table 4. Other adsorption structures are shown in Figure S3.

The SO2 is prone to be
adsorbed over the TO site with smaller adsorption distance
(1.63 Å) compared to
the adsorption on the perfect and O vacancy surfaces. More important,
the adsorption energy is much larger than the adsorption on other
surfaces. Thus, the SO2 molecule has larger chemical interactions
with the O2c atom compared to the O3c atom.
The electron transfer exhibits little change compared to the adsorption
on the perfect surface. As to the adsorption of SOF2 and
SO2F2, both of them are not likely to be adsorbed
on the TO site; instead, the adsorption on the TV site brings larger adsorption energies for SOF2 and SO2F2—it locates nearly right above one O3c atom. Compared to the adsorption energy and electron transfer
for SOF2 and SO2F2 adsorption, it
can be seen that the Zn vacancy also cannot lead to the obvious elevation
of the adsorption energy, only bringing small increases of electron
transfer for SO2F2 adsorption. However, the
Zn vacancy can bring significant different phenomenon to H2S adsorption. In Figure 7d, one H–S bond is possibly broken with much larger
H–S distance (2.38 Å). The S atom in H2S also
moves close to the O2c atom. Like the adsorption of H2S on the perfect surface, the adsorption on the Zn vacancy
surface does not show obvious energy barrier and exhibits spontaneous
H–S bond breakage with exothermic process. The adsorption of
H2S exhibits a much larger adsorption energy compared to
the adsorption over the perfect surface (−2.98 eV compared
to −1.64 eV). This significant elevation of adsorption energy
is attributed not only to the broken bond of H–S, but also
to the chemical interactions between the S atom in H2S
and the O2c atom. The CDD and ELF configurations of the
gas molecule adsorbed on the Zn vacancy surface are shown in Figure 8. There exists obvious charge depletion between the S atom
and the O2c atom, whereas charge accumulation happens around
two O atoms in SO2; from the ELF configuration of SO2 adsorption, an apparent yellow region can be found between
the S atom and the O2c atom, indicating possible new bond
formation. For SOF2, the depletion region mainly locates
below the S atom and the accumulation is mainly around other atoms
in the molecule, demonstrating that the electron transfer between
the molecule and the surface is relatively weaker, but the adsorption
process brings intramolecular electron transfer in SOF2 like the adsorption on the perfect surface. In Figure 8c, the charge accumulation
region is mainly between the SO2F2 molecule
and the surface. Figure 8f,g shows an obvious blue region between SOF2 and O3c and between SO2F2 and the surface,
indicating little possibility of bond formation for SOF2 and SO2F2 adsorption over the Zn vacancy surface.
For H2S adsorption, the CDD configuration exhibits apparent
charge depletion around the new-formed O–H bond with charge
accumulation around the S atom. The ELF configuration shows that there
exists a yellow region between the S atom and the O2c atom,
indicating a possible new-formed S–O chemical bond. To assess
the chemical interactions, the DOS as well as the molecular orbitals
are analyzed and compared with the adsorption on the perfect surface
(Figure 9) and on the surface with one O vacancy (Figure 10).

and (g) and (h), H2S adsorption (corresponding to Figure 5).

The DOS configurations are all shown in Figure 11. The 17th antibonding
orbital of SO2 partially moves near the Fermi level, and
the 11th–16th
bonding orbitals also experience significant hybridization and new
bond formation. As to the chemical interactions between the S atom and the O2c atom in Figure 11b, there is obvious hybridization of S 3p and O 2p near −10,
−7.5, and +3 eV. The hybridization demonstrates strong chemical
interactions between the S atom and the O2c atom, which
conforms to the possible new bonding in ELF configuration. The molecular
orbitals of SOF2 and SO2F2 also have
some changes to some extent, such as the 16th–21st orbitals
of SOF2 and the 22nd–25th orbitals of SO2F2. However, very little hybridization between the atom
in the gas molecule and the atom on the surface can be found in Figure 11d,f. As a result,
there is low possibility for new bond formation between the surface
and the gas molecule (SOF2 or SO2F2), but there still exists some chemical interactions bringing a degree
of change of molecular orbitals. For H2S adsorption, the
molecular orbitals of H2S exhibit tremendous changes as
it can be seen in Figure 11g. This phenomenon is mainly due to the bond breaking. Also,
large area of hybridization between the S atom and the O2c atom can be seen near −12, −7 to −6, 0, and
+3 eV. The hybridization illustrates strong chemical interactions between these two atoms, and thus strong chemical
interactions happen for H2S adsorbed on the TO site, resulting in the H–S bond being broken and much larger
adsorption energy.

2.5 Diffusion Behavior of Gas
Molecule over the
Surface
The diffusion behavior is important for determining
the sensing performance of nanomaterials toward gas detection. For
H2S adsorption over the perfect ZnO(101̅0) surface,
because it showed obvious decomposition with no energy barrier, the
diffusion of both pieces will be very difficult, so we did not take
it into consideration. And of course, the adsorption over the O or
Zn vacancy mainly happens if the vacancy exists, so we also did not
consider them. As a result, we mainly discussed the diffusion behaviors
of SO2, SOF2, and SO2F2 over the ZnO(101̅0) surface by calculating energy barriers
and comparing them with the adsorption energies to evaluate the difficult
level of the diffusion process, as shown in Figure 12. The diffusion of SO2 from one
O3c site to another O3c site exhibits 0.91 eV
energy barrier, much smaller than the adsorption energy (1.27 eV),
so we estimate that the diffusion process is very easy for SO2. Also, nearly the same phenomenon can be observed for SOF2 and SO2F2, that is, the energy barrier
is much smaller than the adsorption energy. As a result, the diffusion
process is relatively easy for these three kinds of SF6 decomposed products, and this phenomenon can bring benefits to the
desorption process.

3 Conclusions
This work discussed the adsorption behaviors of four kinds of SF6 decomposed products on the perfect, O vacancy, and Zn vacancy
ZnO(101̅0) surfaces. The perfect ZnO(101̅0) exhibits considerable
chemical interactions to SO2 and H2S with possible
new bond formation. In spite of this, the H2S can be easily
dissociated to H and H–S species with no energy barrier. Four
kinds of molecules all act as the electron acceptor. The introduction
of one O vacancy on the surface does not bring obvious enhancement
for chemical interactions between these four molecules and the surface.
The O vacancy can only slightly increase the electron transfer between
the adsorbed molecule and the surface. However, when introducing one
Zn vacancy on the surface, the O2c atom exhibits high chemical
activity to SO2 and H2S, bringing much larger
adsorption energy. The chemical interactions can also be reflected
by the changes of molecular orbitals of the adsorbed molecule and
the hybridization between the atom in the molecule and the atom in
ZnO. To enhance the surface interactions to SO2 or H2S to improve the gas-sensing properties, it is feasible to
introduce more Zn vacancies on the surface. This study provides a
theoretical basis surface modification of ZnO-based gas-sensing materials
applied in detecting SF6 decomposition products.

4 Computational Methods
The first-principle calculations
using the density functional theory
(DFT) method were achieved by linear combination of atomic orbitals
in the Dmol3 package.37,38 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
function approached by the generalized gradient approximation was
adopted in consideration of the approximation of the exchange-correlation
functional.39 The double numerical polarization
basis set combined with the DFT semicore pseudopotential was chosen
with a global cutoff radius of 4.5 Å. When considering long-range
van der Waals force for gas adsorption, the DFT-D2 method proposed
by Grimme was adopted.40 When carrying
out geometric optimization process, 1.0 × 10–6 Ha, 0.001 Ha Å–1, and 0.005 Å (1 Ha
= 27.21 eV) for energy tolerance, maximum force, and displacement
were set for convergence, respectively.

The hexagonal wurtzite
structure of bulk ZnO has lattice cell parameters
of a = 3.24 Å, c = 5.21 Å.15 The ZnO(101̅0) surface was cleaved with
three layers, as shown in Figure 1a. The bottom two layers were constrained before proceeding
with geometric optimization, and only the first top layer was fully
relaxed. The first top layer of the ZnO(101̅0) surface contains
two different types of Zn and O atoms, including three-coordinated
Zn atom (Zn3c), four-coordinated Zn atom (Zn4c), three-coordinated O atom (O3c), and four-coordinated
O atom (O4c). To consider the role of one O vacancy or
one Zn vacancy in the adsorption process, one Zn or one O atom was
removed from the surface, and after full geometric optimization, the
final perfect ZnO(101̅0) surface and the surface with one Zn
or O vacancy were obtained, as shown in Figure 1.

A 4 × 4 × 1 and a 6 ×
6 × 1 k-point were set when carrying out geometric
optimization and electronic
property calculations.41 Considering the
difficulty of defect formation, we calculated the formation energy
of one O vacancy and Zn vacancy with and without vdW force. The formation
energy of one O or Zn vacancy on the surface in different environments
(Zn rich and O rich) was obtained as follows42 1  where Edefect ZnO surface, Eperfect ZnO surface, nZn, μZn, nO, and μO are the total calculated
energy
of ZnO(101̅0) surface with one vacancy, perfect ZnO(101̅0)
surface, the number of Zn vacancy, the chemical potential of one Zn
atom, the number of O vacancy, and the chemical potential of one O
atom, respectively. In this work, for one Zn vacancy on the surface, nZn = 1 and nO =
0, and for one O vacancy on the surface, nZn = 0 and nO = 1. The chemical potentials
of one Zn and one O atom were calculated using the bulk phase of the
Zn crystal and the oxygen molecule. This method proved to be accurate
and efficient for calculating defective structure of ZnO.43

After obtaining the structures of perfect
and defect ZnO(101̅0)
surfaces, one gas molecule of SF6 decomposed products was
put upon the surface with a different initial position. After full
geometric optimization, the adsorption energy of every gas molecule
adsorbed on the ZnO(101̅0) surface can be defined as 2  where EZnO surface/gas is the total energy of one molecule adsorbed on the perfect or defect
ZnO(101̅0) surface. EZnO surface and Egas are the total energies of the
perfect or defect ZnO(101̅0) surface and one gas molecule before
adsorption, respectively. To understand the physical and chemical
interactions between the adsorbed gas molecule and the ZnO(101̅0)
surface, the charge density, electron localization function (ELF),
and density of states (DOS) were calculated and analyzed.

After
calculating the charge density, the three-dimensional charge
density difference (CDD) can be calculated using the following equation 3  where ρZnO surface/gas, ρZnOsurface, and ρgas are the total charge density of the optimized adsorption structure,
perfect or defect ZnO(101̅0) surface, and isolated gas molecule,
respectively. The electron accumulation region was colored as purple,
and the electron depletion region was marked as green. The total charge
density result can also deduce the electron transfer between the adsorbed
gas molecule and the ZnO(101̅0) surface using the charge analysis
method proposed by Hirshfeld as44 4  where ρ0(r) is the
charge density of one selected isolated atom. By adding
up all ρ0(r) of every atom, ∑ρ0′(r) can be obtained. ρ(r) represents the total
electron density of the calculated structure. To evaluate the chemical
bond formation between the adsorbed gas molecule and the ZnO(101̅0)
surface, the ELF configurations were calculated. The region where
the value was close to 1/2 demonstrated high probability of bonded
electron pair, indicating the possible new-formed chemical bonds between
the adsorbed gas molecule and the ZnO(101̅0) surface.45 To further investigate the chemical interactions,
the molecular orbitals of the gas molecule and the DOS were also taken
into consideration.
