In
this work, the use of ultrasound energy for chromium removal
from residual tannery leather was investigated. The following parameters
were evaluated: complexation temperature (60–90 °C), chromium/complexant
molar ratio (1:0 to 1:6), complexation time (30–120 min), washing
steps (1–14), washing temperature (25–80 °C), and
washing time (1–10 min). For all evaluated conditions, chromium
removal was monitored by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The
residual tannery leather after different extraction strategies were
characterized using a scanning electron microscopy. For the proposed
method, the optimized conditions were: 3 g of residual tannery leather
to be treated, 100 mL of extraction solution (chromium/complexant
molar ratio of 1:3), at 80 °C and 30 min of sonication. To complete
the chromium removal, only five washing cycles (50 mL of water at
50 °C) of 3 min were required. Using these conditions, a chromium
removal higher than 98% was achieved. Under the same reaction conditions,
the results were compared with mechanical stirring (100 rpm), which
allowed observing the significant effects of ultrasound for chromium
removal. Comparing to the conventional method, the total time of the
process (including extraction and washing steps) was decreased from
150 to 45 min and the water volume for the washing was reduced from
450 to 250 mL. Therefore, the proposed ultrasound-assisted process
can be considered as a suitable alternative for chromium removal from
residual tannery leather.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Chromium is an element
introduced into the environment mainly by
industrial activity, such as pigments manufacture and leather tanning.1,2 Although Cr has been used in several industrial applications, it
is neurotoxic and a potential problem for the environment and human
health.2−4 On this aspect, the maximum concentration of Cr(VI)
and Cr(III) allowed in industrial effluents and wastes in several
countries started to be strictly regulated. In Brazil, the maximum
limits for residual water are 0.1 and 1.0 mg L–1 to Cr(VI) and Cr(III), respectively.5

Among the industrial processes, Cr(III) has been widely used
in
wet-blue tanning by diffusion through the pores of the leather.1,2 Then, Cr reacts with carboxyl groups from collagen, forming inter
or intra molecular crosslinks, increasing the physical and chemical
resistance of the material.3,4 After the process, the
residual tannery leather presents a high Cr concentration, low compaction
ability, and low density, being classified as a dangerous waste and
requiring the disposal in industrial landfill.6,7 The
expensive costs of land disposal associated with the decrease in the
number of disposal sites have led to an increased search for alternative
treatments for these residues.8,9

A few studies
have proposed the reuse of these residues without
Cr removal, which can be used for dyes adsorption (e.g., drimarem
red, cibacrone yellow and procion blue).10,11 In these cases, the adsorption efficiency using these residues has
been successfully compared to the reference method using active coal.10,11

Despite its high toxicity, after Cr removal, the residual
tannery
leather can be used in alternative processes. Some authors have reported
the use of this material for the production of animal feed and as
mineral source for plants nutrition.12−14 Several applications
such as immobilization of residual leather in building blocks, blends
manufacture, production of antistatic floor, and membranes replacement
can be highlighted for engineering applications.15,16

The main limitation for the reuse of residual tannery leather
is
the difficulty of Cr extraction. Some alternatives have been proposed,
such as the use of hydroxamic acids and enzymatic hydrolysis.17−20 However, the use of hydroxamic acids requires a long time (36 h)
to achieve an efficient extraction (more than 85%).17 In addition, the process based on enzymatic hydrolysis
is limited by the formation of metabolic inhibitory products, combined
with the high acquisition cost of pure enzymes.18 Moreover, these processes generate significant leather
degradation, reducing the yield and the quality of raw materials.17−20 In this sense, the development of alternative methods for Cr extraction
from residual tannery leather are needed, making possible the increasing
of waste reuse.

Ultrasound is considered a suitable approach
for the improvement
of several processes, including extraction, oxidation, desulfurization,
adsorption, among others.21−30 When ultrasound is applied in extraction processes in a liquid medium
containing solids, bubbles can be formed with further collapse (cavitation)
in the liquid–solid interface, increasing the transport rates
of extraction solution as well as the surface area of the substrate.31,32 This more effective contact between liquid and solid phases can
be attributed to the micro-jets formed during the bubble collapse,
which increase the leaching properties of the extraction solution.33,34 In addition, some radical species can be formed during the cavitation,
affecting the extraction conditions as well as the stability of some
compounds.33−35 Among the advantages of ultrasound-assisted extraction
(UAE), comparing to the conventional extraction methods, the reduction
of extraction time, low reagent consumption, and milder temperature
can be highlighted.36,37 The challenges in the extraction
procedures are associated with the high initial cost and the scaling
difficulties in industrial flow.

Despite several advantages
of using ultrasound in chemical processes,
it has been used mainly for the pretreatment of tannery leather.2 In this case, the ultrasound application during
leather tanning improves the Cr uptake and reduces significantly the
shrinkage.2 However, no studies were found
in the literature about the effect of ultrasound on Cr extraction
from tannery residual leather.

Taking into account the feasibility
of ultrasound for extraction
of several compounds from different materials, Cr removal from residual
tannery leather using ultrasound energy was investigated. Several
reaction conditions, such as complexation temperature, Cr/ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) molar ratio, complexation time, washing steps, washing
temperature, and washing time were evaluated. Additionally, experiments
using conventional extraction (silent condition) were optimized for
comparison of extraction efficiency. Chromium determination was performed
by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). In addition, after
applying the UAE process and conventional extraction, the treated
tannery leather was characterized by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Chromium
Determination in Residual Tannery
Leather by FAAS
The assessment of total element concentration
(e.g., Cr) is an important parameter for the development of extraction
protocols.36,37 The residual tannery leather
was digested in a heating block for subsequent Cr determination. Chromium
was determined by FAAS and concentration was 25 285 ±
94 mg kg–1.

2.2 Evaluation
of Cr/EDTA Molar Ratio for Conventional
Extraction
EDTA is a well-known complexant for several elements,
including Cr and has been widely used in extraction methods. The reaction
between EDTA and Cr provides the formation of a water-soluble complex
that might be extracted from residual tannery leather applying washing
cycles. In this sense, the Cr/EDTA molar ratio was evaluated from
1:1 to 1:6. In this study, 100 mL of extraction solution and 3 g of
residual tannery leather were stirred for 120 min at 70 °C were
employed, followed by 14 washing steps with 50 mL of water at 25 °C
and 10 min. The results are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Influence of the Cr/EDTA molar ratio on the
Cr removal by conventional
extraction (n = 3). Conditions: 100 mL of extraction
solution and 3 g of residual tannery leather stirred for 120 min at
70 °C, followed by 14 washing steps with 50 mL water at 25 °C
and 10 min.

For the Cr/EDTA molar
ratio of 1:1, Cr removal was 81.4 ±
0.7%. When 1:3 and 1:6 were evaluated, Cr removal was slightly increased
to 89.6 ± 0.6 and 90.0 ± 0.5%, respectively. Taking into
account that no significant difference (Tukey–Kramer) was observed
for the molar ratios 1:3 and 1:6, the molar ratio 1:3 was chosen for
subsequent experiments.

2.3 Evaluation of Washing Steps
for Conventional
Extraction
As previously mentioned, washing steps are necessary
for Cr removal, taking into account that Cr/EDTA complex is soluble
in the aqueous phase. In this way, up to 14 washing cycles were evaluated.
In this study, 100 mL of extraction solution (molar ratio 1:3) and
3 g of residual tannery leather were stirred for 120 min at 70 °C.
The water volume, time, and temperature for each washing step were
kept constant as 50 mL, 10 min and 25 °C, respectively. The washing
time was also evaluated (1, 3, 5 and 10 min), but better results were
achieved using 10 min. The results for the experiments of washing
are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Influence of the number of washing steps on the Cr removal by conventional
extraction (n = 3). Conditions: 3 g of residual tannery
leather in 100 mL of extraction solution (Cr/EDTA molar ratio of 1:3).
The water volume in each washing was 50 mL, the temperature set at
25 °C, and time of 10 min.

As can be seen in Figure 2, using 9 washing cycles, the efficiency of Cr removal
(89.6
± 0.6%) did not increase significantly, and the residual Cr in
tannery leather was 7.4 ± 0.6 mg kg–1. This
residual value is in agreement with the Brazilian Legislation.5

2.4 Evaluation of Temperature
and Complexation
Time for Conventional Extraction
Considering that Cr/EDTA
complexes can be unstable in the aqueous phase because of the ions
desolvation (e.g., ion Cr(III) in the complex [Cr(H2O)6]3+), some parameters such as temperature and time
are important to improve the extraction efficiency. In these sense,
the complexation temperature (60–90 °C) and complexation
time (30–120 min) were investigated. In these experiments,
100 mL of extraction solution (molar ratio 1:3), 3 g of residual tannery
leather, and 9 washing cycles (with 50 mL water at 25 °C and
10 min) were employed. The results are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Effect of complexation time and temperature
in the conventional
extraction (n = 3). Conditions: 3 g of residual tannery
leather in 100 mL of extraction solution (molar ratio 1:3) with 9
washing cycles using 50 mL of water at 25 °C and 10 min.

Chromium removal using 60 and
120 min at 60 °C was 53.9 ±
1.2 and 55.8 ± 1.2%, respectively. However, when a slight increase
in the temperature up to 70 °C was applied, the extraction efficiency
using 60 and 120 min was significantly better (81.3 ± 1.2 and
89.6 ± 0.7%, respectively). It is important to mention that no
significant difference (Tukey–Kramer) was found between 60
and 120 min at 80 °C (about 91% of Cr removal). Taking into account
that the leather starts to degrade at 90 °C, 80 °C was selected
as the best temperature.

The optimized condition using conventional
extraction was 3 g of
residual tannery leather, 100 mL of extraction solution (Cr/EDTA molar
ratio of 1:3), during 60 min at 80 °C and with 9 washing cycles
with 50 mL of water at 25 °C and 10 min. It is important to mention
that the overall process (including extraction and washing steps)
requires about 150 min to achieve a Cr removal no better than 91%.

2.5 Evaluation of Complexation Time and Acoustic
Power of Ultrasound for UAE
After the preliminary experiments,
the complexation time (15, 30, and 60 min) for UAE was evaluated.
In this study, 3 g of residual tannery leather, 100 mL of extraction
solution (molar ratio of 1:3) at 80 °C and 9 washing cycles (50
mL water at 25 °C and 10 min) were used. For experiments using
15, 30, and 60 min, Cr removal was 72.5 ± 0.5, 92.3 ± 0.5,
and 92.6 ± 0.4%, respectively. Using 30 min as complexation time,
practically the same values for Cr removal were achieved after 60
min of conventional extraction. These results correspond to a reduction
of about 50% in the extraction time using UAE.

For the evaluation
of the influence of ultrasound in the extraction process, the acoustic
power delivered into the system was determined by calorimetry.38,39 Its calculation took into account the variation of temperature,
the mass of residual tannery leather, and the specific heat of the
solution.38,39 When calorimetry was applied in the ultrasonic
bath, the acoustic power was about 2.70 W. On the other hand, the
acoustic power for mechanical stirring (100 rpm) was only 0.02 W.
Some authors have reported that the use of ultrasound can lead to
an increase of energy and mixing, improving the extraction efficiency.36,37 On the basis of these preliminary results, it was supposed that
the ultrasound energy can provide an additional energy to increase
the Cr removal in the proposed process.

2.6 Influence
of Washing Temperature and Time
for UAE
During the optimizations, a strong dependence between
the washing temperature and Cr removal was observed. In these experiments,
3 g of residual tannery leather, 100 mL of extraction solution (molar
ratio 1:3), and 9 washing cycles (10 min each cycle) using 50 mL of
water were employed. For the complexation step, ultrasound was applied
during 30 min at 80 °C. After, the washing cycles were employed
using ultrasound under controlled temperature (25, 50, and 80 °C).

The Cr removal was about 92% after 3 washing cycles using UAE at
25 °C, which was the same efficiency when the conventional process
was employed. When 50 °C was evaluated using UAE, the Cr removal
was about 98% after 5 washing cycles. Thus, by increasing the temperature
(50 °C), it was possible to improve the Cr removal. Considering
that 80 °C can start the degradation of residual tannery leather,
50 °C was selected for further experiments.

After optimization
of washing temperature (50 °C), the washing
time for Cr removal (1, 3, 5, and 10 min) was evaluated. In these
experiments, 3 g of residual tannery leather, 100 mL of extraction
solution (molar ratio 1:3), and 5 washing cycles assisted by ultrasound
with 50 mL of water at 50 °C were employed.

Using 1 min
in each washing cycle, the Cr removal was 94.1 ±
0.2%. By increasing the washing time for 3, 5, and 10 min, Cr removal
was better but constant at about 98%. Taking into account that no
significant difference (Tukey–Kramer) was observed between
3, 5, and 10 min, 3 min was chosen. It is important emphasize that
the Cr concentration in the residual tannery leather using these conditions
was in agreement to the current legislation.5

The optimized conditions for Cr removal using ultrasound were
3
g of residual tannery leather, 100 mL of extraction solution (Cr/EDTA
ratio molar 1:3), temperature of 80 °C, and 30 min of sonication.
To complete the Cr removal, only 5 washing cycles (50 mL of water
at 50 °C) of 3 min were required. The overall UAE process (including
extraction and washing steps) requires about 45 min to achieve a Cr
removal up to 98%.

2.7 Characterization of Residual
Tannery Leather
by SEM
After the optimization of the proposed process, the
morphology and structure of residual tannery leather were characterized
by SEM. These experiments enable to evaluate if the ultrasound could
contribute to the Cr removal, taking into account its chemical and
physical effects.36,37 Additionally, the energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was employed for the qualitative Cr determination.
In Figure 4 are shown
the micrographs and EDS spectra from residual tannery leather before
treatment as well as after conventional extraction and after UAE.

Figure 4 SEM micrographs
(magnification of 300 times) obtained for (a) nontreated
residual tannery leather; (b) residual tannery leather after conventional
extraction; and (c) residual tannery leather after UAE.

In Figure 4, it
is possible to see some substantial differences comparing the treated
and untreated residual tannery leather. The untreated leather (Figure 4a) showed particles
with microfibrils structures. After the conventional extraction, the
morphology of remaining leather was more distinct (Figure 4b) and microfibrils were not
observed. After UAE, microfibrils structures were recombined, and
the morphology was modified showing small structures as vesicles (Figure 4c).

In addition
to the SEM analysis, the EDS spectra showed that the
extraction process was successful, evidenced by the identification
of Cr only in the untreated leather (Figure 4a). In conventional extraction, peaks of
Na and Al were observed (Figure 4b). It is important to mention that some elements as
Na and Al were not detected when leather was submitted to the UAE
method (Figure 4c).

2.8 Complexant Recovery and Its Recycle in the
Extraction Process
In order to evaluate the complexant recovery
for further recycling in UAE, experiments using acid addition after
washing were carried out. These experiments were performed using the
residual water (after washing steps) by adding concentrated H2SO4 up to complete precipitation of EDTA. The EDTA
recovery was calculated by the gravimetric analysis. The EDTA recovery
was possible because when in its acidic form, the complex (Cr-EDTA)
is unstable, and Cr3+ is released into the solution.40 The EDTA in the acidic form has low solubility
(about 0.5 g L–1 at 20 °C) in water and can
be easily precipitated.40 In this work,
the EDTA recovery was 97.2 ± 1.3%.

In Table 1, is shown a comparison between
the proposed process using ultrasound energy and other systems described
in the literature. In the proposed process, the extraction time was
significantly decreased when ultrasound was used. It is important
emphasize that a diluted complexant solution was used, and a high
extraction efficiency was achieved. In addition, the use of ultrasound
energy is in agreement with some green chemistry aspects, once it
allows the Cr removal, leather recycling, and complexant recovery.

3 Conclusions
The
UAE was considered an advantageous alternative process for
Cr removal from residual tanned leather. It was observed that the
ultrasound energy showed better extraction efficiency comparing to
mechanical stirring, as well as the reduction of reaction time and
water volume (30 and 50%, respectively). The main advantages of UAE
comparing to the processes already described are: (i) the use of diluted
extraction solutions, (ii) relatively small extraction time, (iii)
extraction at atmospheric pressure, (iv) low reagent consumption and
(v) EDTA reuse. All these advantages result in the economy of reagents
and waste reuse, contributing to the green chemistry aspects.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Instrumentation
The UAE process was
performed in an ultrasonic bath (25 kHz), operating at 132 W nominal
power (model USC-1800A, UNIQUE, Brazil) at 100% of amplitude. The
UAE process was carried out in a glass cylindrical reactor with 5
cm of internal diameter. Temperature was controlled using a circulating
water bath (model MCT 110 Plus, Servilab Ltda., Brazil). Experiments
for conventional extraction were performed in 100 mL glass beakers
using a hot plate, with mechanical stirring (model 752A, Fisatom,
Brazil).

For total Cr determination in residual tannery leather,
samples were digested in a heating block (MA4004, Marconi, Brazil),
equipped with 25 open vessels (capacity of 25 mL). About 0.1 g of
sample was digested using 2 mL of concentrated HNO3, and
the following heating program was applied: (i) 10 min of ramp up to
115 °C and hold for 120 min at 115 °C and (ii) 20 min for
cooling. After cooling, the digests were diluted with ultrapure water
up to 25 mL in a volumetric flask for further Cr determination by
FAAS. Before determination, samples were filtered through a polytetrafluoroethylene
membrane (0.22 μm) and diluted with ultrapure water when necessary.

Chromium determination was performed in a flame atomic absorption
spectrometer (model AAS55, Varian, USA) equipped air/acetylene flame
was employed. The Cr hollow cathode lamp was operated at 4 mA, the
wavelength was set at 357.9 nm, and the spectral band pass was set
at 0.8 nm. Signals (absorbance high) were monitored for 3 s.

The residual tannery leather after UAE and conventional extraction,
as well as the untreated leather were characterized by SEM (model
Sigma 300 VP, Carl Zeiss, Germany) operating in the high vacuum mode
with a secondary electron detector for qualitative analysis of images.
An energy-dispersive detector for X-ray spectrometry (model Quantax
EDS, Bruker, Germany), coupled to the SEM (SEM–EDS) equipment,
was used for qualitative analysis of solid residues.

4.2 Reagents, Standards, and Samples
All reagents used
in this work were of analytical grade. Deionized
water was purified using a Direct-Q UV3 purification system (Millipore,
USA), with resistivity of 18.2 μS cm. Stock reference solution
of 100 mg L–1 Cr was prepared by dissolution of
CrCl2 (Vetec, Brazil) in 5% (m/v) HNO3 solution.
Calibration solutions were daily prepared by serial dilution of stock
solution in 5% (m/v) HNO3 solution. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA, purity 99.4%, Sigma-Aldrich, USA), prepared by dissolving
a suitable amount in ultrapure water was used for the extraction process.
Concentrated HNO3 (65%, Moderna, Brazil) was used for samples
digestion, and concentrated H2SO4 (95%, Moderna,
Brazil) was used for EDTA recovery after tannery leather treatment.

Residual tannery leather was purchased in a local industry in the
Rio Grande do Sul State (Brazil). The feedstock was cut into small
pieces with diameters lower than 0.3 cm. Before treatment, the sample
was stored in glass flasks at room temperature.

4.3 Methods
Initially, Cr extraction
was performed using the conventional process (silent condition). These
experiments were carried out in a glass cylindrical reactor with 5
cm of internal diameter. About 3 g of residual tannery leather were
transferred to the extraction vessel, 100 mL of extraction solution
(EDTA solution) were added and the mixture was submitted to conventional
extraction. Then, the removal of Cr/EDTA complex was performed by
applying washing cycles with water. After each washing cycle, the
solid leather was separated from water, and Cr concentration in aqueous
phase was determined by FAAS. The following extraction parameters
were evaluated: Cr/EDTA molar ratio (1:1, 1:3, and 1:6), washing steps
(1–14 with 50 mL of water) after extraction, complexation temperature
(60, 80, and 90 °C), and complexation time (30, 60, and 120 min).
All experiments were performed with mechanical stirring at 100 rpm,
and the temperature was monitored using a digital thermometer.

UAE was performed under the same conditions applied to the conventional
extraction. However, the following parameters were also evaluated:
complexation time (15, 30, and 60 min), washing temperature (30, 50,
and 80 °C) and washing time (1, 3, 5, and 10 min). It is important
emphasize that the extraction vessel was introduced into the ultrasonic
bath considering the position that higher ultrasound intensity (5
cm) and the pH in the extraction step was kept constant (pH = 5.0)
in all experiments. The pH 5.0 was chosen for the experiments because
of the ability of EDTA as complexing agent. At low pH, the nonionized
EDTA predominates and for the complexation to occur, the metal ions
must be able to remove the ionizable hydrogens from the EDTA.40 At high pH, the hydrogens are removed by reaction
with hydroxide ions. In this case, there is a “competition”
with the hydroxyl groups, and many metal ions can be hydrolyzed and
precipitated as hydroxides.40

An
important feature of UAE and that need to be monitored is the
energy input into the system, which was determined by calorimetry
according to previous works.38,39 This evaluation was
performed using 3 g of residual tannery leather and 100 mL of complexant
solution, under ultrasound at 100% of amplitude for 20 min. The temperature
was monitored using a digital thermometer. Ultrasound power dissipated
into the extraction solution was calculated as shown in eq 1 1  where Cp is the heat capacity of water
(4.2 J g–1), M is the mass of water
(g), and dT/dt is the temperature
rise per second. The initial
temperature rise was measured at room temperature by using a thermocouple,
which was immersed in the extraction solution and was held at the
half height of the solution during the extraction.

The residual
tannery leather with and without treatment was characterized
by SEM. Samples were cut into sections of 10 × 10 mm and mounted
on the specimen stub. Metal overlay was not necessary. Samples were
observed using SEM–EDS with an accelerating voltage at 8 kV,
and the data were collected with a distance of 7.9 mm from the electron
source.

Finally, using all the optimized conditions for UAE,
the possibility
of EDTA recovery in the extraction process was evaluated. These experiments
were performed by adding H2SO4 to precipitate
EDTA-H4.
