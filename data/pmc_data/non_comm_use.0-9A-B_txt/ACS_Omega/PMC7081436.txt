The
microstructural, thermomechanical,
and quasistatic mechanical properties of biobased polyamide 410 (PA410)/poly(octane-co-ethylene)-g-maleic anhydride (POE-g-MA) blends with the impact toughener in the composition
range of 0–20 wt % have been investigated, with an aim to overcome
the poor notch and strain sensitivity of PA410. The crystallinity
of the blends obtained from enthalpic measurements and initial degradation
temperature indicating thermal stability remained mostly unaffected.
A remarkably substantial increase, i.e., ∼15-fold enhancement,
in the impact strength of the PA410/POE-g-MA blends
leading to ultratoughening of PA410 accompanied by a significant increase
in tensile strain at breaking is achieved though the elastic modulus
(E) and yield strength (σ) decreased with impact
modifier content. Thermomechanical analysis revealed a broadening
in the loss tangent peak in the temperature range of ∼−50
to −30 °C corresponding to the POE phase, whereas the
loss tangent peak corresponding to the PA410 phase stayed unaffected.
Conventional theoretical models such as the rule of mixture and foam
model were used to analyze the micromechanics of low-strain (<1%)
mechanical response (E), and Nikolais–Narkis
model and Isahi–Cohen models, for high-strain (>2%) mechanical
response (σ). The interdependence of impact toughness, ductility
ratio, and domain size of the dispersed rubber phase in the PA410/POE-g-MA blends could successfully be established vis-à-vis
the mechanistic role of interparticle distance. Scanning electron
microscopy showing domain coalescence of the soft elastomeric POE
phase thus reiterated the pivotal role of interdomain distance and
domain size in influencing the toughening mechanism of PA410/POE-g-MA blends. The qualitative phase distribution attributes
based on atomic force microscopy remained in sync with quantitative
parameters, such as domain size, hence reaffirming the mechanism behind
ultratoughening of PA410 by POE.

1 Introduction
In view of the rapid resource
depletion, the search for alternative
engineering plastics and specifically the extensively used polyamides
has been in focus to ensure sustainable technocommercial viability.
In this regard, biobased polyamides such as polyamide 410 (PA410),
have significant advantages over other biobased polyamides (PA), such
as PA610, PA11, and PA1010 in terms of an enhanced processing window
(due to a high melting point and mechanical properties). PA410 is
a new class of biobased polyamide that is obtained from the polycondensation
reaction of a diacid part (sebacic acid) originating from a renewable
plant source (castor oil), which is ∼70%, and a diamine (diaminobutane)
from a petroleum source, which is ∼30%.1,2 The
literature also shows the renewable path for production of diaminobutane
from succinic acid to make PA410 a 100% biobased polyamide with zero
dependence on conventional fossil fuels, although this approach is
not yet attempted on a commercial scale.3 The properties of PA410 are those of a combination of short- and
long-chain polyamides, which expands application possibilities. Alike
other polyamides, PA410 shows poor notched impact strength, which
significantly limits its use in applications that expose it to very
high strain rates. Toughening of polyamides using the principles of
internal plasticization or by the incorporation of suitable rubbers/elastomers
has remained a mechanistically effective and commercially viable route
due to the extrusion-assisted integrated melt-mixing in combination
with filler incorporations. Considering the fact that PA410 has attributes
of 10 methylene moieties along the C-axis of the
polymer, the blending of an elastomeric component like POE, having
8 methylene moieties in the polymer chain, may lead to a functionally
effective interaction scenario that is in tune with the Flory–Huggins
thermodynamic criteria for mixing. Such an interaction may efficiently
favor reduction in the size of the incorporated rubber domains, which,
in turn, may enhance the intrinsic resistance to crack propagation
and hence fracture resistance vis-à-vis resistance to notch
sensitivity and strain sensitivity.

Highly flexible polyolefin-type
elastomers with a much lower modulus,
such as ethylene propelene rubber (EPR),4,5 styrene-ethylene-butylene
styrene block copolymer (SEBS),5−8 ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (EPDM),9−11 poly (ethylene-octene) elastomer (POE),12−14 etc., have
proven to be commercially feasible as an effective dispersed phase
to toughen the matrix polyamide (PA) phase through various reported
mechanistic pathways, such as cavitation, crazing, shear yielding,
and shear banding mechanisms. The type of rubber, domain size, and
interaction with the matrix phase play a crucial role in rubber-induced
toughening.15,16 Polyamides, due to their inherently
high polarity (attributed to amide linkages), limit effective phase
interaction with elastomers or any other rubber modifiers, and that,
in turn, facilitates enhanced interfacial tension, leading to poor
adhesion between the phases and thereby causing inadequate stress
transfer.17 To overcome these issues, conventionally,
functionalized elastomers are favored. For example, rubbers grafted
with maleic anhydride (-MA) were employed to ensure interaction between
anhydride moiety of elastomer and −CONH of polyamide matrix
so that stress transfer across the phase interface becomes more efficient.17 Since larger amounts of free-radical initiator
increases the possibility of chain scission and lowers the molecular
weight, the content of -MA is therefore kept limited to less than
1%.18 Such a lower amount of grafting also
helps preventing complete miscibility of the two components in the
blend and thereby stabilizes the thermal stability, mechanical properties,
and crystallinity of matrix polyamide. Reportedly, the use of SEBS/SEBS-g-MA,17,19−21 EPDM/EPDM-g-MA,22−25 and POE/POE-g-MA26−29 combinations enhanced toughening
of polyamide to the extent of increasing the order of enhancement
particularly when functionalized elastomers are incorporated. Besides
traditional functionalized elastomers, fluoroelastomer,30 β-nucleated thermoplastic vulcanizates
based on EPDM-g-MA,31 and
epoxidized natural rubber (ENR)32 have
also been reported to be used for toughening of PA 6 with a loading
percentage of ∼30 wt %. Similarly, the incorporation of styrene
functionalized POE-g-MA has also been reported to
have offered a drastic reduction in domain sizes and improved adhesion
with matrix PA 6 compared with neat POE-g-MA.29

The viscosity-to-elasticity ratio of POE
is relatively lower than
that of EPDM, EPR, and SEBS.33 POE is preferred
over the other elastomers when faster mixing and better dispersion
of the components are the aspects critically sought. This is even
more pertinent because the viscosity of Polyamide 410 is higher than
that of the many conventional polyamides at their melting points.
The POE/POE-g-MA-induced toughening in the case of
PA 633 and PA 61227,28 is reported to significantly enhance the toughness-to-stiffness
ratio. As per the percolation theory proposed by Wu, the interparticle
distance and domain size play determining roles in controlling not
only the mechanism of toughening but also the extent of enhancement
in the toughness.34 In contrast to high-performance
PA 6 and PA 66, PA410 offers better dimensional stability; oil, grease,
and salt resistance; and resistance to other chemicals in combination
with a low hygroscopic nature. However, the poor notch resistance
and strain sensitivity limits the possibilities of such a new class
of polyamide from being exploited for several automotive, engineering,
and other speciality applications. Therefore, the use of low-modulus
and high-flexibility polymer polyolefin elastomer such as POE with
a lower viscosity-to-elasticity ratio that ensures not only the domain-dispersed
morphology but also minimum compromise in the mechanical attributes
of the polyamide 410 (PA410) matrix may be a promising alternative.
In this context, the present paper critically explores the toughening
efficiency of an elastomeric inclusion like POE-g-MA into the sustainable and bioresourced polyamide like Polyamide
410 that would not only ensure reduction in the strain rate and notch
sensitivity but also pave the way to design a fracture-resistant and
durable class of polyamide compounds with much less dependency on
fossil fuels.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Thermal Characterization
The melting
endotherms obtained after second heating and the cooling exotherms
of the blends are shown in (Figure 1a,b). The plot clearly shows that the extent of endothermic
heat involved in the process remained nearly unaffected irrespective
of the compositional variations in the blends. The melting and crystallization
behavior as assessed from the differential scanning calorimeter (DSC)
peaks and the extent of crystallinity measured from these data is
shown in (Table 1).
It was observed that the crystallinity remained nearly unaffected
with the increase in the extent of incorporation of the elastomeric
POE phase. Such an observation in the crystallinity indicates that
the incorporation of the POE phase does not interfere with the crystalline
microstructure of the PA410 matrix. This may be attributed to the
fact that the amorphous phase effectively accommodates the POE phase
where both matrix and dispersed phases may randomly coexist. The thermal
stability of the blends is characterized by using thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) curves, as shown (Figure 1c); the blends showed one-stepped degradation
behavior, wherein the onset to degradation temperature remained at
∼420 °C and that is well above the processing temperature
of the blends. The absence of any distinct peaks at ∼100 °C
indicates the absence of any absorbed or adsorbed water/moisture.
The similarity in the nature of TGA plots also indicated that the
degradation behavior is mainly dominated by the matrix phase, i.e.,
the polyamide (PA410) phase.

2.2 Rheological Behavior
The rheological
behavior of the blends is assessed by measuring the variation of complex
viscosity (η*) as a function of angular frequency (ω)
in the range of 0.01–100 rad/s on a parallel plate setup (shown
in Figure 2). The flow
behavior of these blends is further analyzed by measuring the melt
flow index (MFI) data (Table 2). The variation of complex viscosity clearly showed the composition
dependence of flow behavior at a temperature above the melting point
of PA410, i.e., ∼270 °C. It could be observed from the
plot shown in (Figure 2) that the blends showed three distinct types of flow dynamics corresponding
to three distinct composition ranges. These are type-I flow in the
composition range of 0–5 wt % of POE-g-MA,
type-II flow in the composition range of ∼10 wt % of POE-g-MA, and type-III flow in the composition range of 15–20
wt % POE-g-MA in the blend. The shear thinning tendency
increased with the increase in POE content in the blends. This may
be attributed to the fact that at higher POE content the melting of
the blends becomes too smooth as the elastomer chains become more
loose, thereby increasing the tendency of chain slippage and chain
movements against each other. Such shear-assisted chain dynamics operating
in the blends is attributed to the enhanced extent of phase interactions
leading to increased viscosity with increase in elastomeric POE content.
These results are also corroborated by the MFI data (Table 2) wherein the decrease in viscosity
was attributed to possible interactions between anhydride moiety and
amide linkage.

2.3 Morphological Characteristics
The
xylene-etched cryofractured surface morphologies of PA410/POE-g-MA blends are shown (Figure 3). The micrographs show the uniformly distributed
voids/cavities scattered and embedded on the surface of the matrix
phase. These cavities indicate the void space created by the dislodging
of the dispersed POE phase upon dissolution and swelling in hot xylene.
Thus, the cavities indicate the size of the elastomeric domains. The
randomly scattered white globules on the surface indicates loosely
adhered and swollen elastomeric particles that are dislodged from
the PA410 matrix phase. The size and size distribution of the domains
dispersed in the matrix phase have been measured by using Image J
software. The number average domain size (Dn), interfacial area (Ai), and interparticle
distance (τ) were measured by using Wu’s percolation
theory. The various parameters defining the domain-related attributes
are given in (Table 3). The micrographs in general shows characteristics of partial miscibility.
The domain sizes increased with the increase in the POE contents in
the blend, and in consequence the interdomain distance decreased.
Such two-phase domain-dispersed morphology remained not only distinct
but also the domain sizes remained nearly uniform for a given blend
composition. These observations indicate that the shear sensitivity
of the droplet break-up process remained directly proportional to
the amount of elastomeric inclusions. The increased domain sizes of
the POE phase apart from acting as effective stress concentrators
also reportedly facilitate the process of stress dissipation through
reduced interdomain distances.

To understand the realistic distribution
of the elastomeric phase,
the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of sliced specimens were
recorded in lateral force mode. The AFM images (shown in Figure 4) reveal the dispersed
POE phase in the lighter contrast. It can be clearly seen that the
elastomeric phase tends to be more continuous above ≥20 wt
% POE-g-MA content. At the concentration ≥10
wt % POE-g-MA content, the elastomeric phase tends
to coalesce, tending to become more continuous in terms of its phase
distribution. The AFM images thus corroborate the observation from
SEM, and the quantitative measurements (domain sizes and interparticle
distance) remain well in accordance with the qualitative attributes
exhibited by AFM.

PA410/POE-g-MA blends.

2.4 Mechanical Response
The uniaxial
tensile response of the blends is shown in the stress–strain
(σ–ε) diagrams (Figure 5a). The tensile modulus (E) and tensile (yield) strength (σ) of the blends showed a consistent
decrease on increasing the POE-g-MA content (Figure 5b). For example,
the tensile modulus and yield strengths decreased by ∼24 and
30%, respectively in the blend with 15 wt % POE-g-MA compared to that of PA410 matrix. This may be attributed to the
systematic reduction in the extent of bulk rigidity due to the rubber-based
soft phase inclusion. Such phases when incorporated in to polyamide
matrix may lead to interference with the overall packing of the polymer
chains of PA410 in a rigid three-dimensional entanglement space. Similarly,
in flexural mode also, the blends showed continuous reduction in the
flexural moduli (∼34% in the blend with 15 wt % POE-g-MA compared to that of PA410 matrix) and strengths (∼50%
in the blend with 15 wt % POE-g-MA compared to that
of PA410 matrix), indicating the bulk material response under mechanical
loading remained unaffected irrespective of the kind of loading/stressing
and thereby indicating the isotropic and homogeneous nature of the
blends from structural and micromechanics point of views (Figure 5c). The significant
extent of increase in the strain at break (ε) for the blends
with increase in the POE-g-MA content indicates the
deformation mode of the blends to be shifting gradually from semiductile
to distinctly ductile modes. This is clearly inferred from the registered
strain (strain at break) value of ∼>50% (distinctly ductile)
in the blends with ∼15–20 wt % POE-g-MA to ∼20% (semiductile) in PA410 matrix. Such observations
correspond to the fact that the toughness of the blends becomes more
dominated by the yielding and necking related phenomena whereas in
the neat polyamide matrix the toughness value remained grossly controlled
by the tensile yield strengths (σy). Interestingly, due to the inherent notch sensitivity of polyamides,
the toughness measured in quasistatic uniaxial tension modes may actually
be indicative from general assessment of material point of view. However,
the Izod impact strength data showed (Figure 5d) significant enhancement (∼400%
increase) in impact strengths in the composition range of ∼10–15
wt % POE-g-MA. Such an increase reiterates the high-strain
energy dissipation ability of the blends that is fundamentally controlled
by an optimum size of the domain of the dispersed elastomeric phase
as a morphological parameter. It is thus quite evident that the energy
dissipation ability of the blends with 0–10 wt % POE-g-MA remains primarily matrix-controlled whereas the same
remains domain size controlled when the POE-g-MA
content exceeds 15 wt %. To understand the intrinsic toughness-to-stiffness
response of these blends in a combined manner as the response to both
low-strain and high-strain deformations, the impact strength data
is normalized with Young’s moduli (elastic modulus), (Figure 5d). It is found that
the impact strength to the Young’s modulus ratio resembles
the trend of absolute impact strength values measured for the various
blends. These observations qualitatively indicate that the bulk mechanical
response of the blend systems is mainly controlled by the attributes
of the elastomeric phase, viz., domain size and interparticle distance.

and ultimate tensile strength, (C) flexural modulus and strength,
and (D) impact energy and impact strength to the Young’s modulus
ratio as a function of POE-g-MA content (wt %).

To further assess the micromechanical aspects responsible
for such
materials, various theoretical models are reported to be useful.35 Two of these theoretical models that most convincingly
are based on two extreme assumptions are (a) simple rule of mixture
considering the fact that the attributes of the two components may
be quasilinear and (b) foam model proposed by Isahi–Cohen that
renders the dispersed domain phases in a noninteracting and noncontributing
phase, such as in foams or voids. The rule of a mixture is inherently
based on considerations that blend systems are ideal with perfect
bonding between the two phases and without any residual stress or
voids while overruling the possibility of the presence of any defects
at the interface either due to the processing or due to any possible
interaction between the two phases. Since in polarity-grafted elastomer-induced
toughening of polyamide systems normally some interactions always
remain, the rule of mixture may be modified and given as in eq 1 1  Eb, Em, and Er are the elastic
modulus of the blend, matrix polyamide 410, and dispersed rubber phase
(∼3.2 MPa as per technical data sheet of the supplier) and
φr is the volume fraction of POE-g-MA. The estimations based on this model showed a nearly linear trend
of decrease with the increase in the volume fraction of the dispersed
POE-g-MA phase. However, the experimental data remained
well below the predictions from the rule of mixture in all compositions
above 5 wt % elastomer, which intrinsically accommodated interaction
possibility between the two phases.

The inapplicability of the
rule of mixture lead to explore the
possibility of other theoretical models that revolve around the assumption
of the absence of any interaction between the two phases, such as
Isahi–Cohen’s foam model that considers the dispersed
domains as essentially noninteracting as foam or void. The model may
mathematically be represented as given in eq 2 2  The estimations
based on the foam model showed
negative deviation in the whole composition range, indicating the
absence of voids in the blend systems. This inevitably signifies the
existence of chemical interaction between the terminal amide group
of PA410 and the -MA moiety of POE-g-MA. The predictions
based on the rule of mixture and Isahi–Cohen model are shown
(Figure 6a). It is
evident (Figure 6a)
that the experimental data remains bounded by the predictions based
on the two models. The rule of mixture thus leads to the upper bound
predictions, whereas the Isahi–Cohen model leads to estimations
that form the lower bound prediction. Furthermore, it is also indicated
that the blends with ≥10 wt % POE-g-MA may
show a distinct biphasic morphology whereas ≤5 wt % POE-g-MA leads to indistinct and near-uniform single-phase morphology.
These observations are well in agreement with the morphological attributes
obtained from SEM and AFM measurements, as discussed in the previous
section. The percentage of -MA in POE-g-MA is ∼0.5%,
which is very low for complete miscibility of the two phases in the
blends, although it sufficiently ensures the reduction in the interfacial
tension through the formation of a copolymer based on PA410 and POE-g-MA. Therefore, the blends may be construed as partially
miscible with a biphasic architecture.

(a) elastic modulus and (b) yield stress
as a function of the POE-g-MA volume fraction.

Beyond the elastic limits, the high-strain mechanical
response,
i.e., yield stress, may also be analyzed by using theoretical models
such as (a) Nicolais–Narkis model as given in eq 3 and (b) porosity model as given
in eq 8. The two models
fundamentally differ in terms of their conceptual argument over the
(a) presence of interphase interaction considered as an adhesion parameter
as in the Nickolais–Narkis model and (b) the absence of phase
interaction leading to generation of porosity as in porosity models,
which are widely employed in polymer blend systems. The Nicolais–Narkis
model considers the phase interaction and characterizes the extent
of phase adhesion with the parameter K, where a lower
value of K illustrates better adhesion; i.e., for poor adhesion, the
value of K may be taken as 1.21.36 3   4  The investigated blend systems lead to a K value of 0.86, indicating intermediate adhesion. The Nicolais–Narkis
model outcomes showed negative deviation at lower loadings of rubber,
i.e., at φr ∼ 0.10, and a transition to positive
deviation could be obtained above 10 wt % POE-g-MA
content indicating the existence of phase interaction till 15 wt %
POE-g-MA loading, as shown (Figure 6b). Further incorporation of rubber tends
to exceed the experimentally determined values. In contrast to the
Nicolais–Narkis model, the porosity model, which conceptually
deals with the noninclusion of the contribution from the minor/dispersed
phase on the load-bearing ability of the material and thereby assumes
the presence of a minor phase in the macromorphology of blends as
pores or voids, showed a near conformity to the experimental data.
The parameter α in the porosity model signifies poor adhesion
when its magnitude is higher, indicating the presence of stress concentration
in the blends. The theoretical values obtained from the porosity model
have been found to be closer to experimentally determined values of
yield stress (σ) with α = 1.93 (Figure 6b). The correspondence of domain size (Dn) and interparticle distance (τ) to impact
energy (as the resistance to instantaneous loading) as a function
of the rubber concentration (φr) reaching a maxima
at 15 wt % POE-g-MA may further be correlated to
the observed deviations from the understanding of the porosity parameter
(α) and adhesion parameter (K) based on yield
stress (σ) data. The remarkable enhancement in impact toughness
indicated by a jump of ∼15-fold, upon incorporation of 15 wt
% POE-g-MA, reiterated the possibility of enhanced
phase adhesion that is further supported by the parameters α
and K corresponding to the porosity model and Nicolais–Narkis
model, respectively.

2.5 Dynamic Mechanical Analysis
The variation
of storage moduli with temperature at a frequency of 1 Hz is shown
(Figure 7a). The dynamic
mechanical responses showed similar trends in storage decay irrespective
of the blend compositions in the entire temperature range. The neat
polyamide 410 matrix, i.e., NE-00, and the blend with 5 wt % POE-g-MA content (NE-05) showed resembling responses till 30
°C and showed nearly identical responses at a temperature above
30 °C. Such an observation indicates the subdued effect of elastomer
in NE-05 in conditions close to the room temperature. Furthermore,
such effects clearly reveal the polyamide matrix-dominated effect
of the blends at temperature >30 °C. Interestingly, ∼50–60%
decrease in the storage modulus could be seen in the temperature range
of −60 to +60 °C irrespective of the blend composition.
However, in the proximity of room temperature, i.e., close to ∼40
°C, NE-00 and NE-05 have shown comparable magnitudes of storage
moduli, although upon further incorporation of POE-g-MA above 5 wt %, i.e., for NE-10 and NE-15 blends, about 18% decrease
in the storage moduli values was registered. A substantial extent
of loss in storage moduli could be noticed (Figure 7a) when both elastomer concentration and
temperature (as influencing parameters on storage behavior) were increased.
The damping behavior of the blends evaluated in terms of the loss
tangent (tan δ = loss modulus/storage modulus) showed
two distinct peaks at −43 and 68 °C corresponding to the
second-order transition (Tg) of POE-g-MA and polyamide 410, respectively (Figure 7b). The intensity of tan δ increased
with the rubber concentration and a sharp peak could be observed in
the blends with a POE-g-MA content of ∼10–20
wt %. The nature and position of the tan δ peak corresponding
to the polyamide phase remained grossly unaffected in all blend compositions.

2.6 Domain Size–Ductility–Toughness
Interdependence
The substantially remarkable enhancement
in impact toughness in the case of semiductile or brittle plastics
is technically referred as “super toughness”. The influencing
parameters bringing out such effects based on Wu’s percolation
model are elastomer concentration, domain size (Dn), and interparticle distance (τ) of the dispersed
phase. For example, the super toughness in the case of polyamide 6
was reported when the Izod impact energy exceeded 800 J/m for 20 wt
% EOR-g-MA loading with a dispersed phase domain
size of <0.4 μm. In contrast, the use of a maleated elastomer
with polyamide 6 has reportedly lead to super toughness at an elastomeric
impact modifier loading of 10 wt %, especially when the matrix is
an amorphous polyamide.12 Therefore, the
super toughness may be construed as a qualitative term that only signifies
the extent of improvement in impact toughness. Contextually, in the
case of polyamide 410/POE-g-MA blends, the blend
composition NE-15 with 15 wt % POE-g-MA dissipated
the maximum impact energy (∼290 J/m), which is well above ∼1500%
compared to that of the neat polyamide 410 (∼18 J/m). Such
a remarkable improvement is not known for any toughened polyamide
system. Since the impact energy, fundamentally, has a correlation
with the dispersed phase domain size, interparticle distance, ductility
ratio, yield stress, and interfacial area,15 a comprehensive mechanistic discussion on the possibility of intrinsically
correlating such material parameters/properties has been attempted
and is shown (Figure 8). The impact energy dissipation increases with the domain size (Dn) and ductility ratio (dR) in the vicinity of the composition range with POE-g-MA of 10–15 wt %, as indicated in Figure 8. It is well reported by15 that domain size (Dn) of the dispersed phase in the range ∼0.2–0.4 μm
effectively enhances the toughening via cavitation or shear yielding
processes, while the relatively larger elastomer particles (∼2–3
μm) facilitate the multiple crazing phenomena, leading to brittle
fracture. In the investigated blends, the domain size remained broadly
in the range of ∼0.24–0.38 μm in the entire composition
range. Such an observation evidently emphasizes on cavitation-dominated
toughening as the primary mechanism behind enhanced impact energy
dissipation of PA410/POE-g-MA blends. The SEM micrographs
of xylene-etched impact-failed specimen lending further support to
such a theoretical remark pertaining to the mechanistic pathway behind
a toughening process is displayed (Figure 9). The absence of plastic deformation characteristics
such as elongated fibrils or strips or stretched domains clearly indicates
a polyamide matrix-dominated failure behavior of the blends with 5–10
wt % POE-g-MA content. The debonding at the interface
is attributed to mismatch in the phase moduli of PA410 and POE-g-MA phases. This caused the creation of new debonded surface
like that in cavitation-assisted failures, when the blend specimens
were subjected to impact loading, and hence effective impact energy
dissipation is limited in NE-5 and NE-10. However, in NE-15 and NE-20
blends, the extensive plastic deformation with shear yielding could
be observed clearly and is discussed in the subsequent section. The
effective energy dissipation in such blends is related to significant
reduction in interparticle distance (τ) vis-à-vis a proportionate
increase in domain size (Dn). Such a scenario
of increased Dn and reduced τ effectively
facilitates the stable crack propagation under instant high strain
loading and thereby dissipates more impact energy with stretched domains
of the relatively lower modulus elastomeric phase. The elongated domains
were reported to be critically responsible for absorbing high-impact
energy, and due to strong phase adhesion, matrix-shear yielding may
take place,37 an aspect discussed in the
subsequent section dealing with failure surface morphology. Reportedly,
the synergy effect of both cavitation and matrix yielding sufficiently
enhancing toughness manifold is illustrated in several polyamides
and other condensation polymers.37,38 In the present
context, the enhancement in impact toughness by more than 15-fold
compared with neat polyamide 410 matrix reaffirms the possible role
of similar mechanistic attributes.

SEM micrographs of PA410/POE-g-MA blends.

2.7 Failure Surface Morphology
The scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of the xylene-etched impact fracture
surfaces of the blends clearly indicate elastomeric (POE-g-MA) phase inclusions in the PA410 matrix for the blends with 5–10
wt % POE-g-MA content (Figure 9). On the other hand, the blend compositions
with ≥15 wt % POE-g-MA content showed continuous
channels of POE phase (xylene-etched), indicating the possibility
of coalescence of elastomeric domains during high-impact failure of
the blends. It could also be observed from the micrographs that the
blends with 5–10 wt % POE-g-MA showed relatively
smoother topography than the blends with 15–20 wt % POE-g-MA where the surfaces appeared topographically more corrugated
and uneven. The smooth topographic features indicate lesser extent
of energy absorption by the material prior to failure compared with
the materials leading to more uneven and corrugated surfaces post
fracture, as the net surface area created due to fracture is higher
in the uneven surface morphology. These indicated that in blends with
15–20 wt % POE-g-MA the extent of energy dissipation
is more intensive than in the blends with lower extent of POE-g-MA. The surface micrographs distinctly reveal the transition
in the underlying deformation mechanism from a cavitation-dominated
toughening mechanism in the blends with 5–10 wt % POE-g-MA to shear yielding/shear banding in blends with 15–20
wt % POE-g-MA content. Isolated droplets under high-impact
deformation leading to deadhesion of the dispersed phase from the
PA410 matrix facilitates the creation of a state of distribution of
voidlike structures, which intrinsically absorb impact energy through
the debonding/d-adhesion phenomenon that involves the balancing of
surface energy through creation of new surfaces. On the other hand,
blends with ≥15 wt % POE-g-MA content undergo
shear-yielding type of failure, as evident from the stretched-strip
type marks on the surface of the wide ridges-type interspersed PA410
matrix. The phase-composition-dependent mechanistic attributes of
these investigated blends are further illustrated in the schematic
detailing the dispersed phase cavitation and deformation-assisted
shear-yielding phenomena (Figure 10). The schematic narrates the morphological alterations
in the preimpact (stage-I) and the postimpact (stage-II, and stage-III)
scenarios that were confirmed by the etched surface micrographs (stage-IV).
The mechanistic sequence of the large-strain (impact) deformation-induced
transformation in the bulk morphology has been schematically differentiated.
In stage-II of postimpact, the blends with 5–10 wt % POE-g-MA undergo cavitation as a consequence of stretching,
leading to phase interface failure where rubber droplets remain confined
and distributed in the three-dimensional space of matrix. This is
in striking contrast to the blends with 15–20 wt % POE-g-MA where the stage-II of the postimpact scenario may be
a simplified two-step process involving (a) stretching/elongation
of the POE-rich domains followed by (b) stretching-induced domain
coalescence, giving rise to a a state of quasicontinuous POE phase
distributed in the matrix. These coalesced quasicontinuous POE phases
when etched appear as darker channels that are POE free. Such POE-free
channels are distinctly visible in the SEM images, as reproduced in
the schematic shown in stage-IV (Figure 10).

mechanism.

3 Conclusions
The following salient conclusions were drawn from the study.1. Toughening of biobased
polyamide 410
could be remarkably increased by conventional melt-blending with polyolefin-based
copolymer grafted with a nominal amount (0.5%) of maleic anhydride.

2. More than ∼15-fold
enhancement
in notched impact strength of PA410/POE-g-MA (85:15
by wt %) could be achieved, a phenomenal increase indicating feasibility
of ultratoughening of biobased polyamides.

3. The noninterference of a polyolefin-based
elastomer, i.e., POE-g-MA, with the crystalline regime
of polyamide 410 intrinsically favors the retention of the attributes
originating from the polyamide matrix, such as yield strength (reduced
∼30%) and temperature for the onset to degradation of the blends,
thereby ensuring the engineering property profile of the biobased
polyamide remaining minimally compromised, when the extent of increase
in failure strain (∼34%) is considered simultaneously. The
relaxation behavior of the two components remained unaffected on a
gross level, as indicated by the two distinct loss tangent peaks obtained
from dynamic mechanical analysis.

4. Estimation of theoretical micromechanical
modeling of the elastic modulus and yield strength data has revealed
closer proximity with experimental findings.

5. The critical domain size for ultratoughening
has been found to be in the range of 0.29–0.33 μm of
polyolefin copolymer domains, i.e., POE-g-MA, in
the context of this study.

6. Mechanistic attributes to ultratoughening
have been found to be originating from a synergistic role of cavitation-assisted
domain coalescence and shear yielding of the coalesced elastomeric
domains.



4 Experimental
Section and Methods
4.1 Preparation of Blends
The raw material
description with specification and the sample designation based on
POE-g-MA proportion in wt % are given in Tables 4 and 5. The blends were prepared
by counter-rotating a twin screw extruder (EuroLab 16- Thermo Fisher
Scientific) at a screw speed of 100 rpm with varying POE-g-MA content (wt %). The blended strands were then chopped and dried
at 80 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h to remove moisture prior to
injection molding. The tensile, flexural, and impact samples (as per
ASTM D 638, 790, and 256) were obtained from injection molding [L&T
Demag machine (Model PFY 40-LNC4P)]. The maintained processing conditions
and temperature profiles in the extrusion process and injection molding
are listed in the following tables (Tables 6 and 7).

4.2 Thermal Characterization
The crystalline
and melting behaviors of neat PA410 and blends were analyzed by a
Perkins Elmer (Model Pyris 6) differential scanning calorimeter (DSC)
at a constant heating and cooling rate of 10 °C/min from 20 to
270 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere. To remove thermal history, blends
were heated first, (cycle 1) then cooled to obtain a crystalline peak
temperature (cycle 2). In the same temperature range, the cooled samples
(free with thermal stresses) were heated again (cycle 3) for the melting
peak. The crystallinity of the blends was calculated from the heat
of fusion of the crystalline peak of blends (ΔHm), heat of fusion of 100% crystalline PA410 (ΔHmo) is taken as 269 J/g,1 and w is the weight fraction of matrix PA410 in
the blends using the equation 5  

4.3 Rheological Behavior of
the Blend
Parallel plate mode rheological response of the
blends was conducted
in a Malvern rotational rheometer (Bohlin Instruments) at 270 °C.
The frequency sweep test was administrated for a 0.01 to 100 rad/s
frequency range with a constant strain amplitude rate to ensure a
linear viscoelastic response of the rheological behavior of the blend.
Characterization of the melt flow index (MFI) of the neat form and
blends was executed as per ASTM D1238 standard at 270 °C with
a constant load of 2.16 kg in the Dynisco MFI apparatus. The MFI shows
the melt flow of blends in border aspects and indispensable for processing
in injection molding.

4.4 Morphology of the Blends
4.4.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) of the
Blends
The dispersion morphology of POE-g-MA on PA410 matrix was analyzed by a scanning electron microscope
(Zeiss EVO-50). A random section of extruded strands was kept for
30 min in a closed liquid nitrogen chamber (cryoconditioned) for brittle
fracture. The cryofractured samples were then subjected to hot xylene
(at ∼100°C) for selective removal of the rubber phase
for an induction period of 24 h. The etched cryofractured samples
were coated with gold to make them conductive for possible interaction
with the electron gun of the scanning electron microscope. An average
of 100 dispersed particle diameters was taken into account (from the
image processed in Image J software) for the estimation of number
average diameter, Dn (eq 6) and interfacial area, Ai (eq 7). The critical interparticle distance (τ) was calculated
using Wu’s percolation equation (eq 8)34 6  Ni is the number
of particles, and Di is the diameter of
the particles. 7   8  Dn is the number average
diameter estimated using eq 6, and φr is the volume fraction of the dispersed
phase. τ indicates
the extent of the close arrangement of the dispersed phase, which,
in turn, signifies the degree of toughness enhancement to absorb and
sustain the high strain loading/energy.

4.4.2 Lateral
Force Mode Atomic Force Microscopy
(AFM) Image Analysis of Blends
To further investigate the
dispersion of the soft phase in polyamide 410 matrix, the lateral
force mode AFM scan of the impact specimen was conducted using Nanosurf
AFM instrument. Lateral force microscopy is a static/contact mode
scanning where a cantilever is subjected perpendicularly to the scanning
area while restricting the scan rotation for forward and backward
movement. The relative friction between the phases evolves the topology
image of the specimen. The schematic of lateral force mode AFM is
shown (Figure 4).

4.5 Mechanical (Quasistatic) and Thermomechanical
(Dynamic) Properties
The uniaxial tensile response of the
blends was studied on a universal testing machine ZWICK Z250 in room
temperature (30 ± 2 °C) with a cross-head speed of 50 mm/min
(following ASTM D 638). The deflection/bending strength and modulus
were analyzed by the standard flexural testing procedure (ASTM D790).
Impact energy (J/m) of the samples was measured by the Izod impact
(ASTM D256) standard procedure with a prenotch of 45° and 2.5
mm depth. The average of five specimens of each composition is reported
with standard deviation.

Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) of
the virgin polyamide matrix (PA410) and the various blend compositions
was conducted in single cantilever mode on an Q800 (TA Instruments)
by using specimens of dimensions 35×13 ×3 mm3 in the temperature window of −80 and 150 °C at a frequency
of 1.0 rad/s and at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The storage
modulus (E′), loss modulus (E″), and loss tangent (tan δ = E″/E′) have been evaluated for qualitative
assessment of the energy dissipation ability on one hand and quantitatively
ascertaining shift (if any) in glass transition temperature (Tg) peaks of the two components in the blends.
