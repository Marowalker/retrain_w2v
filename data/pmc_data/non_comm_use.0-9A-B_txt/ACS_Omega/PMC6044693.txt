The
initial stage of in vitro polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) polymerization
by PHA synthase from Ralstonia eutropha (PhaCRe) on a mica substrate in water was observed using
high-speed scanning atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). Before PHA polymerization,
the adsorption–desorption cycle of the PhaCRe molecule
on mica was observed in real time. For approximately 30 s after the
addition of the PHA monomer, no significant change was observed on
the mica substrate, but PhaCRe could be transformed into
an active enzyme in water upon contact with the monomer during this
period. Subsequently, linearly elongating rod-shaped objects were
observed on the mica substrate, plausibly as a result of the polymerization
reaction. The height of these elongating objects was considerably
larger than the expected height for a single PHA chain. This observation
suggests that PHA chains generated during the reported experiments
might form some kind of a semiregular structure.

Introduction
Polyhydroxyalkanoates
(PHAs) are carbon- and energy-storage materials
found in various microorganisms and can be synthesized from renewable
resources such as sugars, plant oils, and carbon dioxide.1,2 PHAs are expected to be used as sustainable plastics and as materials
for medical applications because of their thermoplasticity, biodegradability,
and biocompatibility.3,4 PHA synthase (PhaC), a key enzyme
in PHA biosynthesis, catalyzes the polymerization of the acyl moiety
of (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A [(R)-3HA-CoA] into PHA in aqueous solution under ambient conditions.5 The molecular weights of the biosynthesized PHAs
range from tens of thousands to several millions (g·mol–1). Among the known PhaCs, PHA synthase from the bacterium R. eutropha is the most studied enzyme.

To
better understand the polymerization promoted by PhaC, in vitro
studies, rather than in vivo experiments, with purified PhaC and chemically
synthesized [(R)-3HA-CoA] have been conducted for
quantitative analyses. The expected in vitro formation of PHA was
previously observed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) in air using
dried samples.6−9 These studies provided high-resolution images of PhaCs and the resultant
polymers in the initial stage of polymerization; however, these were
not real-time observations and the mechanism of polymer formation
has not been elucidated. To fully understand the polymerization process,
it is essential to characterize the reaction dynamics during PHA polymerization
by observing the process in real time.

Recently, a new-generation
AFM technique, referred to as high-speed
scanning atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM), has been developed and
applied to real-time analyses of the dynamics of biomolecules, such
as the “walking” of myosin V and the degradation of
cellulose by “jamming” cellulases.10,11 HS-AFM observations provide new insights into reaction mechanisms
because scanning is achievable at a high time resolution (20 frames
per second at the maximum) even in aqueous solutions. A previous study
demonstrated the feasibility of using HS-AFM to analyze the enzymatic
syntheses of hyaluronic acid polymers.12 This new observation technique is applicable to a wide range of
enzymatic polymerization reactions. We regarded PHA
polymerization as an interesting target for this observation because
of the unique feature of the polymerization reaction, generating a
water-insoluble polymer from water-soluble monomers, and because of
the industrial usefulness of PHA as a plastic material.

In the
present study, the dynamics of PHA polymerization is assessed
using HS-AFM to provide a better understanding of PHA polymerization
catalyzed by PhaCRe. The observation raises the possibility
of secondary structure formation of PHA chain during polymerization,
which may help us understand its polymerization mechanisms.

Results
and Discussion
The adsorption of PhaCRe molecules
on highly oriented
pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) was preliminarily evaluated in water using
HS-AFM. Very few PhaCRe molecules could be observed on
HOPG in water (data not shown), suggesting that the interaction between
PhaCRe and the HOPG substrate in water may be weak. The
same experiment was repeated using a mica substrate; the acquired
images are presented in Figure 1. The observed width and height of the particles on the mica
substrate were 15.0 ± 4.9 and 2.9 ± 0.7 nm, respectively,
without correction for the AFM tip radius. The width of these particles
is similar to that of a single PhaCRe molecule, as observed
in previous reports.6,7 Notably, the majority of particles
adsorbed on the mica remained on the substrate, whereas several particles
seemed to be dissociated (Figure 1, the particle in the dotted circle) and some were
newly adsorbed (particles in the dotted squares). This observation
indicated that the PhaCRe molecules on mica were equilibrated
between the adsorbed and desorbed states. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first direct observation of dissociation and adsorption
of PhaCRe on a substrate surface.

Figure 1 HS-AFM observation of
PhaCRe on mica in water without
the addition of (R)-3HB-CoA. The incubation time
is shown in each figure. The dotted circle and the dotted squares
indicate dissociating and adsorbing PhaCRes, respectively.

A model of in vitro PHA polymerization
on hydrophobic surfaces
(HOPG) involving the dissociation of PhaCRe from the HOPG
substrate to initiate PHA polymerization has been previously proposed.7 Although the substrate was not the same in this
study, this model was partially validated using HS-AFM observation.

PHA polymerization was also observed using HS-AFM, where mica was
used as a substrate with the addition of (R)-3-hydroxybutyryl-coenzymeA
[(R)-3HB-CoA] as a monomer for the synthesis of poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate], P(3HB). In two of the observed cases
(cases 1 and 2), relatively high spatial resolution was successfully
achieved. These videos are available as Videos S1 (case 1) and S2 (case 2). Snapshots
from these videos are presented in Figures 2 and 3.

of P(3HB) polymerization by PhaCRe on mica in water with
the addition of (R)-3HB-CoA
at 0:34 in Video S1 (case 1). The elapsed
time from (R)-3HB-CoA addition is shown in each figure
on the second time scale. (A) Full images of observation every 10

P(3HB) polymerization by PhaCRe on mica in water with the
addition of (R)-3HB-CoA
at 0:30 in Video S2 (case 2). The elapsed
time from the (R)-3HB-CoA addition is shown in each
figure on the second time scale. (A) Full image of observation at
90 s after the addition of monomer. (B) Enlarged and higher time-resolution
images of the area in the dashed square of (A). The arrow indicates
the growth direction of the elongating object. The globular object
indicated by a triangle in the frame at 112 s might be the occasionally
visualized PhaCRe. The dashed area in the frame at 118
s indicates the elimination of the elongating object during the scan.
The HS-AFM video of this figure is available as Video S2. The time of monomer addition (0:30) is defined as
0 s.

Before the addition of monomer,
the number of particles per view,
corresponding to PhaCRe adsorbed on mica, was ∼10
(Figure 2A). After
the addition of monomer at 0:34 (Video S1), several dozen elongating objects were observed in the same area.
The position where elongation started differed from that of PhaCRe before the addition of monomer. This observation strongly
suggests that the adsorbed PhaCRe would be inactive for
polymerization because it could not be transformed to active synthase
on the mica substrate; instead the active synthase was formed in water.

Elongating objects could scarcely be detected on the mica substrate
shortly after the addition of monomer; these species appeared only
∼30 s after the addition of monomer (Figure 2A). This may be due to the lag phase at the
start of polymerization that has been observed during in vitro spectrophotometric
activity assay.5,13−15 The average
width of the elongating objects was 10.5 ± 2.7 nm without correction
for the AFM tip radius, whereas the height of the objects was 2.2
± 0.5 nm. This size is smaller than that of the PhaCRe molecule (see above); thus, it is natural to assume that the elongating
objects are P(3HB) chains. However, the height is not consistent with
that expected for an extended single polymer chain (usually less than
1 nm).12,16,17 Such oblong
objects seem to have semiregular undulations, which might be attributed
to the formation of a secondary structure. It has been proposed that
the cellular P(3HB) oligomer forms an exolipophilic endopolarophilic
helical structure as a component of an ion channel.18,19 Therefore, on the mica surface, the P(3HB) polymer chains might
form a semiregular helical structure.

In most cases, the objects
elongated linearly and promptly, and
the direction of elongation remained constant after the initiation
of polymerization (Figure 2A and Video S1). The robust elongation
might suggest the formation of a rigid structure like the helical
structure. The maximum rate of elongation of the objects was calculated
to be 4.3 ± 1.1 nm·s–1 from 10 different
elongating spots. Assuming that the elongating object forms a helical
structure with 14 monomers per turn and a helical rise of 0.45 nm
(the expected diameter is 2.4 nm), as proposed by Reusch and Sadoff,18,19 the elongation rate is comparable to the polymerization rate of
∼130 monomers·per second. This rate is slightly higher
than the catalytic turnover of PhaCRe of 100 monomers per
second, determined using a comprehensive kinetic analysis.14 However, some active synthases would individually
exhibit higher catalytic turnover than the average value of the ordinary
synthases.

PhaCRe molecules are thought to be present
on the growing
edge of the objects; they are difficult to observe because active
PhaCRe would be suspended in water instead of being fixed
on the mica substrate. Nonetheless, in a local site (Video S2), PhaCRe might occasionally be observable
on the growing edge of the object (Figure 3B). This globular object, indicated by a
triangle (frame at 112 s), is thought to be PhaCRe. In
the last image in Figure 3B, plausibly due to physical obstruction of PhaCRe, the entire elongating object was removed from the mica surface
by the AFM tip (indicated by a dashed ellipse in the frame at 118
s).

Several unexpected behaviors were found on careful observation
of the AFM videos. The boxed areas in Figure 2B seemed to elongate in two directions from
the same site. There might be two different synthases that elongate
P(3HB) from very close starting points. As the reaction proceeded,
strong adsorption of the PhaCRe–P(3HB) complex on
the AFM tip would take place, thereby reducing the image resolution
remarkably after 64 s in case 1 (Figure 2A) by increasing the tip radius as the elongation
proceeded.

Notably, in this study, elongating objects were observed
only in
the tip scanning area (Figure 4). This localized event might be attributed to the pinning
effect of the P(3HB) chain synthesized by PhaCRe in water,
which acts on the mica substrate because of the tapping force of the
AFM tip.

Figure 4 HS-AFM wide view of scanning area during P(3HB) polymerization
(case 2). The HS-AFM video of this figure is available as Video S2.

On the basis of the observations, the process of P(3HB) polymerization
on the mica surface can be explained as follows: Initially, PhaCRe is adsorbed on the mica surface in an inactive form; however,
before polymerization, PhaCRe undergoes cyclic desorption
and adsorption on the mica substrate. Some dissociated PhaCRes species were activated for P(3HB) polymerization in water by the
addition of (R)-3HB-CoA. After the lag phase at the
start of polymerization, the P(3HB) chains were polymerized by drifting
active synthases. The growing P(3HB) chain was fixed to the mica surface
by the pinning effect of the AFM tip, given that the elongating objects
were observed only in the scanned area. The elongating objects might
form a semihelical structure,18,19 a hypothesis corroborated
by the dimensions (observed diameter is 2.2 ± 0.5 nm, whereas
theoretical diameter is 2.4 nm) and the elongating behavior of the
object. As polymerization proceeded, strong adsorption of the PhaCRe–P(3HB) complex on the AFM tip reduced the image resolution.

In conclusion, real-time observation of the polymerization by PhaCRe in water via HS-AFM was successfully executed. Following
are the noteworthy findings: (i) PhaC undergoes cyclic adsorption
and desorption on mica, and the desorption process is necessary for
the P(3HB) polymerization; (ii) the P(3HB) chain might assume a helical
structure during polymerization by PhaCRe, based on the
observed height and elongating behavior; and (iii) P(3HB) polymerization
drastically increases the adsorption of the PhaCRe–P(3HB)
complex on mica and the AFM cantilever tip. The observations in this
study are highly relevant for understanding the process of PHA polymerization.

Methods
For the preparation of PHA synthase, His-tagged PhaCRe was produced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)
strain (Novagen, Madison, WI) harboring pET-15b::phaCRe.13 The protein was also
purified and desalted as previously reported.14,15 The enzyme purity was confirmed using sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE), according to the standard procedure.
Protein concentrations were determined using a Quant-iT protein assay
kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Aliquots of all proteins were subsequently
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C before
other intended uses.

(R)-3HB-CoA was chemically
synthesized and purified
as a substrate for PhaCRe, according to previously reported
techniques.14

The HS-AFM (NanoExplorer,
RIBM, Tsukuba, Japan) imaging experiment
was conducted using a silicon nitride cantilever (BL-AC10EGS or BL-AC10DS,
Olympus, Tokyo, Japan, tip radius <15 nm). For the observation
of nonpolymerizing PhaCRe, 2 μL of the PhaCRe solution (1 nM PhaCRe in ultrapure water) was placed
on freshly cleaved mica (1.5 mm in diameter) and was incubated in
a moist chamber at room temperature for 5 min. The mica was washed
twice with 10 μL of ultrapure water and scanned in 110 μL
of ultrapure water at room temperature. To observe polymer elongation, R-3HB-CoA (100 μM in final concn) was added to the
scanning cell during the HS-AFM observation. The scale of the images
was 500 × 500 nm2, and the scan rate of imaging was
0.5 frames per second.
