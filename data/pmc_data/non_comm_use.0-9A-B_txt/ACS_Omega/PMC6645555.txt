Hydrotalcites (HTlcs) or layered
double hydroxides (LDHs) have
been used in a wide range of applications such as catalysis, electrochemical
sensors, wastewater treatment, and carbon dioxide (CO2)
capture. In the current study, molecular dynamics simulation was employed
to investigate carbon dioxide adsorption behavior on amorphous layered
double oxides (LDOs) derived from LDHs at elevated temperatures. The
thermal stability of LDHs was first examined by heating the sample
up to T = 1700 K. Radial distribution functions confirmed
the structural evolution upon heating and the obtained structures
were in good agreement with experiments, where periclase was confirmed
to be the stable phase in the recrystallized mixed oxides above T = 1200 K. Further, CO2 adsorption was studied
as a function of amorphous HTlc-derived oxide composition, where static
and dynamic atomistic measures have been employed to characterize
the CO2 adsorption behavior. The simulation results showed
that the CO2 dynamic residence time on LDH-derived LDOs
was sensitive to the Mg/Al molar ratio and the average amount of residence
time of CO2 on the surface of LDOs reached maximum when
the Mg/Al molar ratio was equal to 3.0. Meanwhile, the activation
energy for diffusion also showed local maximum when the Mg/Al molar
ratio was 3.0, suggesting that this particular ratio of Mg/Al mixed
oxides possessed the highest CO2 adsorption capacity. This
is consistent with experimental results. Examination of the binding
between CO2 and mixed oxides revealed that both magnesium
and oxygen in amorphous LDOs contributed to CO2 adsorption.
Further analysis suggested that the interaction between Mg–O
and O(LDO)–C were the most important interactions for the physisorption
of CO2 on amorphous surface and different CO2 adsorption behavior on different Mg/Al molar ratio surfaces was
directly related to their amorphous local structure.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Increasing emission of
greenhouse gases such as CH4, N2O, and CO2 is a major concern that modern
industries are facing all over the world.1−3 A robust near-linear
relationship between CO2 emissions and global warming has
been established through climate modeling studies.4 One of the main sources of CO2 emission is fossil
fueled power plants.5 Pre-combustion CO2 capture is one of the CO2 capture and storage
(CCS) technologies that involve separating CO2 from hydrogen-rich
shift gas from sweet/sour water-gas shift reactors. Successful commercialization
of the above technologies relies on high-performance, reversible solid
CO2 adsorbents with a sufficiently high CO2 adsorption
capacity at elevated temperatures and fast adsorption and desorption
kinetics. The solid CO2 adsorbents can be divided into
three major categories according to their working temperature: low-temperature
adsorbents (<473 K),6 such as carbon-based
and zeolites-based adsorbents; intermediate temperature adsorbents
(473–673 K),7−9 such as layered double hydroxide (LDH)-based and
magnesium oxides (MgO)-based adsorbents; and high-temperature adsorbents
(>673 K),10−13 such as calcium oxides (CaO)-based and silicate-based adsorbents.
Among various solid CO2 adsorbents, LDHs have been recognized
as one of the candidate materials for carbon dioxide adsorption in
the intermediate temperature regime.14,15 LDHs consist
of positively charged brucite-like layers with interlayer space containing
charge-compensating anions. The general formula for LDHs are [MII1–xMIIIx(OH)2]x+ Ax/nn–·mH2O, where MII is divalent
cation (Mg2+), some of which are substituted by trivalent
cation MIII (Al3+), A is an anion (OH–, CO32–, Cl–, NO3–) and x is normally in
the range of 0.2–0.4.6,16

The structural
changes of LDHs during thermal treatment have been
experimentally investigated in the previous studies. Using in situ
techniques to study the thermal evolution of Mg/Al LDHs, Yang et al.17 suggested that Mg/Al LDHs first dehydrated between
343 and 463 K while the remaining was the layered structure, then
dehydroxylated and transformed into an amorphous phase between 463
and 678 K, and finally lost anions in the temperature range of 678–853
K. It is well accepted that LDHs does not possess appreciable CO2 capture capacity because of the limited space between the
layers. However, the CO2 adsorption capacity increases
significantly within the temperature range of 473–673 K with
LDHs gradually losing their compensating anions and OH– and transforming into amorphous mixed oxides.18 Although the structure has been labeled as amorphous oxide,
diffraction peaks corresponding to spinel (MgAl2O4) and brucite (MgO) have also been observed in its X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns.19

Recently, many
studies have been focused on the CO2 adsorption
of LDH and LDH-derived layered double oxides (LDOs) adsorbents. Wang
et al.20 systematically investigated a
series of Mg–M–CO3 LDHs (M = Al, Fe, Ga,
Mn) and demonstrated that different phases formed upon heating and
M3+ determined the CO2 adsorption capacity.
Hutson and Attwood.21 identified that both
physical and chemical CO2 adsorptions of Mg3Al1-LDH increase with pressure. They also showed that
Mg3Al1Cl LDH possessed the highest physisorption/chemisorption
ratio, whereas Mg3Al1CO3 LDH exhibited
the highest combined CO2 adsorption capacity. Reddy et
al.22 found that Mg–Al–CO3 had the highest CO2 capture capacity after calcination
at around 673 K. Gao et al.18 conducted
a study on the effect of Mg/Al ratio on CO2 capture capacity
of amorphous mixed oxide at 673 K. They demonstrated that CO2 capture capacity was the highest when the Mg/Al molar ratio is between
3.0 and 3.5. Sharma et al.23 had also adopted
a series of Mg–Al–CO3 LDH samples with varied
Mg/Al ratio and concluded that it was the optimal condition for CO2 adsorption at 303 and 333 K when the Mg/Al molar ratio is
1.7, which is different from the results of Gao et al.18 However, it is noted that both experiments were
performed in different temperature regions. Nevertheless, the previous
studies suggest that the Mg/Al molar ratio is a key parameter determining
the CO2 adsorption capacity of the LDH-derived mixed oxides.
Recent studies suggested that CO2 uptake capacity of LDH-derived
mixed oxides changed with increasing temperature. Marta et al.24 found a decrease in CO2 uptake of
Mg–Al–CO3 LDH-derived mixed oxide as the
adsorption temperature increased from 323 to 373 K. Moreover, different
adsorption sites exhibited different CO2 adsorption capacity.
Majority of adsorption sites corresponded to physisorption, and some
were chemisorption sites. As a result, the available surface area
could be another controlling factor for adsorption.25 Bolognini26 introduced Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface area to investigate the multilayer CO2 adsorption
of Mg/Al mixed oxides. They found that the number of medium-strength
sites, which was predominant for CO2 adsorption when Mg/Al
molar ratio was between 2.0 and 3.5, was closely related to Mg2+–O2– and Al3+–O2– pairs.

Experimental understanding of the molecular-level
origin of the
complex structure and CO2 adsorption mechanisms on LDHs
and LDHs-derived mixed oxides is usually difficult because of the
limitation of conventional experimental techniques. However, molecular
modeling on the other hand has been highly successful over the last
decade in filling this gap and in providing better molecular-level
understanding. Li et al.27−29 performed grand-canonical ensemble
Monte Carlo (GCMC) and density functional theory to investigate the
CO2 adsorption on C3N, Me–N–C
(Me = Fe, Cu, Co) with different charge states, and it was found that
negatively charged CO2 materials strengthened CO2 capture dramatically. Using GCMC calculations, Li et al.30,31 also demonstrated the promising effect of sulfur doping on CO2 adsorption. Kirkpatrick et al. investigated the structural
and energetic origins of LDH compounds containing short-chain carboxylic
acids using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.32,33 The hydrated interlayer galleries were found to be stabilized by
an integrated hydrogen-bonding network among the anions, water molecules,
and hydroxyl groups of the LDH layers.34 Zhao and Burns employed MD simulation to investigate benzene sorption
mechanisms intercalated into interlayers of organoclays, which were
synthesized from single-chain quaternary ammonium cations (QAC) and
proposed a model to predict the QAC–clay microstructures.35 Recently, Tong et al.36 has adopted MD simulation to investigate the atomistic structure
of monocarboxylic acid-intercalated LDHs containing Mg and Al in the
ratio 3.0, and they found that the basal spacings were closely related
with the carbon chain length of intercalated anions and the presence
of water molecules. Khorshidi et al.37 have
verified that the presence of water was needed to increase CO2 adsorption of Mg–Al–Cl–hydrotalcite
under certain situation using MD simulations. Lombardo et al.38 investigated the thermal effects of Zn/Al LDHs
with different intercalated anions through MD simulation in the temperature
range of 298–473 K. They found that the stability of dehydrated
Zn/Al LDHs was closely related with intercalated anions. These studies
have demonstrated that the utility of MD methods to investigate the
structure aspects of clay–organic composites could provide
significant insights. Unfortunately, most of the previous studies
have been focusing on the structure of LDHs at room temperature. The
structures of LDHs at elevated temperature, especially the structural
evolution during calcination, is not well understood from the atomistic
perspective of view.

In the current paper, we present the investigation
of a series
of MD simulations on the thermal stability of Mg–Al–Cl
LDH and CO2 adsorption behavior on LDH-derived oxides.
First, we built a series of LDH structure models with six different
Mg/Al ratios, that is, 1.0, 1.7, 2.2, 3.0, 3.7, and 4.5. The structural
evolution of LDHs containing Mg and Al in the ratio 3.0 during thermal
treatment from 300 to 1700 K were then characterized utilizing the
radial distribution function (RDF) and XRD. We found that the layered
structure of LDHs collapsed at 800 K, where the amorphous LDOs formed.
The amorphous structure recrystallized to become oxides, and periclase
was observed to be the main phase when temperature reached 1200 K.
The oxide structure finally turned to liquid when it was heated up
to 1700 K. The atomic local structure of amorphous LDOs was further
investigated using Voronoi tessellation and neighbor analysis. Finally,
we performed GCMC simulation to examine the static CO2 adsorption
behavior on the surface of amorphous LDOs, and it showed similar density
distribution at six different Mg/Al molar ratios. To further examine
the dynamic adsorption behavior of CO2 on different Mg/Al
molar ratios, we calculated the residence time of CO2 on
the surface of amorphous oxides determined through dynamic adsorption
analyses. We found that the average amount time for CO2 adsorption reached maximum when the Mg/Al molar ratio was 3.0. The
CO2 diffusion calculation also suggested that the diffusion
barrier for the Mg/Al molar ratio of 3.0 was highest. We further analyzed
the partial RDF of Mg2+–O2–, O2– (LDO)–C or Al3+–O2– pairs. It showed that the binding of Mg2+ and O2– were predominant in CO2 adsorption and different CO2 adsorption behavior on different Mg/Al molar ratio surfaces
was directly related to their amorphous local structure.

2 Simulation Method
2.1 Force Field Parameters
The CLAYFF
force field39 using empirically derived
interaction parameters have been recently employed extensively to
model clay minerals, including LDHs.40 In
this study, both nonbonded (van der Waals and Coulombic) and bonded
(bond, angle) interactions were applied. The CLAYFF atom type for
Mg and Al are octahedral magnesium (mgo) and octahedral aluminum (ao).
Oxygen’s partial charges vary from −0.95 for hydroxyl
oxygen (oh), to −1.1808 for bridging oxygen with octahedral
substitution (obos).39 Aqueous chloride
ion with a partial charge of −1.0 was intercalated into the
interlayer region for charge balancing. Zhu et al.41 have developed a flexible model for CO2 that
allows for intramolecular bond stretching and angle bending. Cygan
et al.42 optimized the force field parameters
for CO2 to improve the accuracy of symmetrical bond stretch
frequency. These force field parameters along with partial charges
acquired from a previous study on CO2 adsorption on montmorillonite42 were used to model CO2.

2.2 Simulation Details
Classical MD simulation
was carried out using LAMMPS,43 developed
at the Sandia National Laboratories. An atomic configuration of the
simulation cell of Mg3Al1-LDH, containing chlorine
intercalated into interlayer region for charge balancing, is illustrated
in Figure 1. The simulation
cell consisted of 4465 atoms with a dimension of approximately 3.7
nm × 6.4 nm × 2.3 nm. Crystallographic directions of [100],
[010], and [001] were oriented along the X-, Y-, and Z-directions, respectively. In
the MD simulations, periodic boundary conditions were applied in three
dimensions of the system. The time step was 1 fs. After initial construction
of the models, energy minimization was conducted until the force and
energy tolerance were below 10–5 kcal/(mol Å)
and 10–5 kcal/mol, respectively. In the current
study, continuous heating was first performed from 300 to 800 K with
a heating rate of 2.5 × 1011 K/s to investigate the
layer structure collapse of LDHs. Pressure was set to be zero in all
dimensions using the Parrinello–Rahman method44 and Nosé–Hoover thermostat45,46 was used to control the temperature. As reported in previous experimental
studies47,48 that after complete collapse of layered
structure of LDHs between 623 and 873 K, the LDHs become disordered
oxide mixtures, suggesting hydrogen atoms and intercalated ions are
no longer existing in the oxides. Following the experimental observation,
we manually removed hydrogen atoms, ions, and some of the oxygen atoms
to maintain charge neutral after the layered structure of LDHs collapsed
at 800 K in the simulation. Then, the simulation was relaxed at 900
K for 2 ns to form amorphous LDOs and further re-heated to 2000 K
at the same heating rate. Because some kinetic processes may not reach
equilibrium during the continuous heating, isothermal heating for
an extended period of time was also performed at the temperatures
of interest (e.g., T = 300, 700, 800, 900, 1200,
and 1700 K) to ensure a better equilibrium.49 The typical simulation time was 2 ns, and the atomic configurations
were dumped every 2 ps for data storage and analysis during isothermal
treatment.

Figure 1 Atomic configuration of the simulation cell at 300 K.

To obtain the amorphous LDOs at room temperature
to further examine
CO2 adsorption behavior, the amorphous LDOs at T = 900 K were then cooled down to 300 K with a cooling
rate of 2.0 × 1011 K/s through an NPT ensemble. The structure was further equilibrated at 300 K through
an NVT ensemble with two free surfaces in Z-direction for 2 ns. To study the CO2 adsorption
on amorphous LDOs, different numbers of CO2 were added
into the vacuum gap between the two free surfaces, and the CO2 adsorption simulation was performed for 2 ns in the NVT ensemble.

Voronoi tessellation was applied to
investigate the local packing
and the coordination number of atoms of the amorphous LDOs. A Voronoi
diagram is a partitioning of a volume into regions based on distances
from a reference point to others in a specific subset of the volume.
For each set of points, there is a corresponding region consisting
of all points closer to that seed than to any other, and the region
is called a Voronoi cell.50 It is noted
that the number of faces of a Voronoi cell is equal to the coordination
number.

2.3 CO2 Static Adsorption Simulations
The static adsorption of CO2 on amorphous LDOs was studied
using GCMC simulations. After equilibrating the amorphous LDO configurations
at 300 K, a vacuum gap of 5 nm was added to the Z-direction to build two free surfaces parallel to the XY plane. The adsorption isotherms were then calculated through series
of fixed pressure GCMC simulations at 300 K. During each fixed pressure
GCMC simulation, CO2 were randomly created in and deleted
from the framework. Molecules within the framework were also randomly
translated and rotated with maximum amplitudes of 1 Å and 5°,
respectively. The configuration that results from one of these steps
is accepted or rejected according to the Metropolis criterion.51 Initial 1 × 106 steps were used
to equilibrate the system, followed by 2 × 106 steps
of the production run from which the average loading and energy were
calculated.

The amount of the adsorbed CO2 (surface
excess) at each pressure was obtained from the difference between
the average loading of CO2 in the presence and absence
of the adsorbent (LDOs). The latter was calculated through GCMC simulation
of an empty box having the same volume as accessible to the gas molecules
in the presence of the adsorbent. The GCMC simulations of the empty
boxes were also used to build the equation of state of the CO2 model used in this study. On the basis of the calculated
equation of state, the pressure of 50 bar was chosen for adsorption
dynamics analysis. The most stable configurations (having the lowest
potential energy) resulted from GCMC simulations at 50 bar were also
saved for further MD simulations. All GCMC simulations were performed
using sorption module52 in the Materials
Studio 8.0 software package.53

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Structural Evolution of
LDH upon Heating
Figure 2 shows the
potential energy (Epotential) as a function
of temperature over a temperature range from 300 to 900 K for a Mg–Al–Cl-LDH
with Mg/Al ratio of 3.0. Evidently, there is an abrupt jump in the
potential energy around 800 K, which indicates that the layered structure
of the LDH begins to collapse and transforms into amorphous state.
The inset shows the corresponding RDFs between all species from 300
to 800 K. The RDF at 300 K shows a typical pattern of crystalline
structure including a sharp peak centered at ∼2.1 Å and
peaks at other interatomic distances. The RDFs do not exhibit significant
changes with increasing temperature from 300 to 700 K, which indicates
that the Mg/Al-LDH retains its layered crystalline structure. However,
at 800 K the original sharp peak at ∼2.1 Å becomes significantly
weakened, suggesting that the original layered crystalline structure
starts to collapse.

K. The inset shows the corresponding RDFs g(r) between all species of Mg–Al–Cl-LDH during
the thermal treatment between 300 and 800 K. (b) Final configuration
of collapsed LDH in XY plane at 800 K.

When temperature was higher than 700 K, LDHs began
to dehydroxylate
and bonds between atoms were gradually broken, as indicated by the
previous study.17Figure 3 supports such observation as the average
bond distances of Mg–O increase abruptly when temperature is
higher than 700 K, suggesting that magnesium oxide is transformed
from a crystalline structure into an amorphous state. The result is
consistent with the bond distance in layered mineral brucite Mg(OH)2 calculated by D’Arco et al.54 In general, crystalline
phases have higher density and shorter average bond lengths than those
of liquids. However, Gutiérrez et al.55 investigated the structural properties of liquid Al2O3 using MD and demonstrated that the liquid phase of Al2O3 was indeed denser than the crystalline phase
and possessed larger fraction of tetrahedral coordinated Al, suggesting
that the bond length of Al–O was longer in the crystalline
phase than in the amorphous state. In the current study, the Al atoms
substitute Mg atoms in the LDHs structure that cause the Al–O
bond length in LHDs longer than that in Al2O3 crystal. Hence, we should expect a drop in Al–O bond length
as the structure transfers to the amorphous state. As expected, the
average Al–O bond distance shown in Figure 3 exhibits an abrupt drop when the temperature
is higher than 700 K, which confirms this structural change.

Figure 3 Mg–O,
Al–O distance variances during the thermal
treatment of LDHs from 300 to 800 K.

After the layer structure of LDHs collapsed, we removed hydroxyl
and anions and then continued to maintain the system at 900 K for
2 ns to form amorphous LDOs and then to heat to 2000 K to examine
structural change in LDOs. Figure 4 shows the change in potential energy of LDOs by increasing
the temperature from 900 to 1700 K. With increasing temperature, the
potential energy of amorphous LDOs continuously increases between
900 and 1700 K. However, there exists an abrupt drop at 1200 K, which
manifests another phase transformation. RDF diagrams in the inset
of Figure 4 show a
typical amorphous structure with two broad peaks centered at 2 and
2.8 Å at 900 K. This indicates that LDH transforms to an amorphous
structure. However, the RDF at 1200 K shows four distinct broad peaks
centered on ∼ 2, 3, 4.8, and 6.6 Å, indicating the emerging
of
crystalline structure of LDOs. The sharp jump in potential energy
around 1700 K suggests a first-order phase transformation, in which
the LDOs melt to the liquid state. The RDF at 1700 K indicates that
the structure has transformed back to amorphous (i.e., melting of
the LDOs).

Figure 4 Potential energy as a function of the temperature of LDOs. The
inset shows RDFs, g(r), of Mg–Al–Cl-LDH
during thermal treatment between 900 and 1700 K.

To further examine the structural evolution of LDH, XRD patterns
were calculated at different temperatures. Figure 5 summaries these patterns. They indicate
that the thermal evolution involves three stages. In the first stage,
which is from 300 to 700 K, XRD patterns show sharp peaks implying
that there is no significant change of layered structure in LDH. The
XRD pattern of LDH from simulation indeed agrees very well with experimental
observations.56 However, the layered structure
of LDH begins to collapse and transforms into an amorphous structure
at 800 K (the second stage), as no obvious peaks appeared. With further
temperature increase, two broad peaks centered at 2θ ≈
30° and 2θ ≈ 60° at 900 K manifests the formation
of amorphous LDOs. The two peaks centered at 2θ ≈ 42.8°
and 62.0°–62.4° at 1200 K indicate that amorphous
LDOs recrystallize. This is in agreement with previous observations,57,58 which indicate that periclase (MgO) is the main observed phase in
Mg3Al1-LDH-derived mixed oxides (see the inset).
In the third stage, crystalline LDOs melt and return to an amorphous
structure at 1700 K.

Figure 5 XRD patterns of LDHs from 300 to 1700 K. The inset shows
comparison
between XRDs of LDOs structure and periclase.

3.2 Local Structure of Amorphous LDOs
We cooled down the amorphous LDOs from 900 to 300 K using a cooling
rate of 2 × 1011 K/s. The structure of amorphous LDOs
was then maintained at 300 K for another 2 ns. The atomic configuration
of amorphous LDO is illustrated in Figure 6a. To examine the structure of amorphous
LDO at 300 K, the local structure of each atom, especially its coordination
number in the simulation cell, was determined. In the current study,
the coordination number is defined as the number of oxygen atoms surrounding
a central atom (Mg here) in the first neighbor. Voronoi tessellation
has been applied to calculate the coordination number of magnesium
with different Mg/Al molar ratios, as shown in Figure 6b. The coordination number of magnesium atom
is close to 6 when the Mg/Al molar ratio is 3.0, which means that
each magnesium atom is surrounded by 6 atoms on average. However,
the coordination number of magnesium is close to 5 when the Mg/Al
molar ratio is other than 3.0. The percentage of coordination number
of 5 is close to 100 percent for Mg/Al molar ratios of 1.7 and 2.2
and it is near 70% for an Mg/Al molar ratio of 3.7. In other words,
the coordination number of magnesium is the highest when the Mg/Al
molar ratio is 3.0. The inset of Figure 6b shows the probability of finding oxygen
in Mg2+ for four different molar ratios. Most magnesium
atoms are surrounded by five oxygen atoms when the Mg/Al molar ratio
is 3.0. However, most magnesium atoms are surrounded by four oxygen
atoms when the Mg/Al molar ratio is 1.7, 2.2 or 3.7. It can be concluded
that the structure of amorphous LDOs at 300 K varies with the Mg/Al
molar ratio and the magnesium atoms of amorphous LDOs tend to bind
with more atoms, especially oxygen atoms when the Mg/Al molar ratio
is 3.0.

Mg/Al molar ratios. The inset shows the fraction of oxygen occupancy
in the coordination number of magnesium. Error bar are not shown in
(b) as their magnitude were negligible compared to the data points.

3.3 CO2 Adsorption Behavior on Amorphous
LDOs
To examine CO2 adsorption behavior as a function
of amorphous oxide composition, amorphous LDO models with six different
Mg/Al ratios were employed, that is, Mg/Al = 1.0, 1.7, 2.2, 3.0, 3.7,
and 4.5. The CO2 adsorption behavior of LDH-derived amorphous
LDOs was investigated at room temperature using two different approaches:
static and dynamic adsorption analysis. Static adsorption analysis
was performed using GCMC simulations, whereas MD simulations were
used to study the dynamics of CO2 adsorption on LDOs. In
GCMC simulations, the pressure range of adsorption isotherms was assigned
according to the equation of state of the CO2 model used
in this study (see Figure 7). In fact, we have performed multiple simulations at different
pressures based on this calculated equation of state, and the pressure
of 50 bar was chosen for MD simulations and adsorption dynamics analysis.
Choosing such a high pressure enabled us to access better statistics
while ensuring that CO2 would still behave as a gas.

Figure 7 Equation of
state of the CO2 model used in this study.
The Peng–Robinson EOS was taken from a previous experimental
study.59 The inset shows the potential
energy of CO2 as a function of pressure.

3.3.1 Static Adsorption Analysis
To calculate
the amount of adsorbed CO2 on the surface of LDOs, two
sets of GCMC simulations were required. In the first set, the ensemble
averaged mass of CO2 in the presence of LDO adsorbents,
⟨mtot⟩, was calculated at
different pressures. In the second set, GCMC simulations were performed
at the same pressures but for empty boxes with the same volume accessible
to CO2 molecules in the first set. This will give the equilibrium
bulk mass of the CO2 in the given pressure and temperature,
⟨m0⟩. The excess CO2 adsorption per surface area mex is then calculated as 1  where A is the area of the
free surfaces of LDOs. Calculated adsorption isotherms are shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8 CO2 adsorption
isotherms calculated using GCMC simulations
of LDOs with different Mg/Al ratios.

The static CO2 adsorption measure shows the overall
adsorption behavior of CO2 on the LDOs’ surfaces. Figure 8 does not show a
significant difference between the overall adsorption behaviors of
LDOs with different Mg/Al molar ratios. This is probably due to the
fact that the static adsorption is a time-average measurement, while
the adsorption behavior itself is a dynamic process; therefore, additional
dynamic analysis is needed to seek the difference affected by the
composition of the amorphous LDOs. Nonetheless, the shape of the adsorption
isotherms resembles that of type II isotherm suggesting that multilayer
physical adsorption takes place.

As mentioned before, the most
stable configurations resulted from
GCMC simulations at 50 bar were used as the initial configuration
of NVT simulation at 300 K. These NVT simulations were used to calculate the density profile of CO2 and further dynamic adsorption analysis. Figure 9 shows a sample of configurations
resulted from GCMC and the density profile calculated from the MD
simulations.

Figure 9 (a) Sample configuration resulted from a GCMC simulation
at 50
bar and 300 K and (b) density profiles (different Mg/Al ratios) calculated
from NVT MD simulations at 300 K using configurations
generated from the GCMC simulations.

The accumulation of the CO2 molecules near the
LDO surfaces
can be recognized in both atomic configuration and density profiles
shown in Figure 9.
Two distinct peaks which emerge near the LDO surfaces in the density
profiles are the confirmation that CO2 molecules formed
multiple adsorption layers (consistent with the shape of the adsorption
isotherms shown in Figure 8). Formation of the second adsorption layer is due to the
high pressure (50 bar) at which the density profiles were calculated.
The position of peaks in the density profiles is used to define the
adsorption region for the dynamic adsorption analysis. Similar to
adsorption isotherms, density profiles of LDOs with different Mg/Al
ratios do not show significant differences.

3.3.2 Dynamic
Adsorption Analysis
For
the dynamic CO2 adsorption, we used the definition proposed
by Impey et al.,60 which was first employed
to calculate the residence time of adsorbed water molecules and has
been used extensively to study the hydration behavior of ions, surfaces,
and nanostructures.18 Following our previous
work,61 we use a simplified version of
this quantity defined as 2  where τi(t) is the ith
CO2 residence
time within a distance criterion for adsorption at t, Pi(t0,t) is a parameter of the ith CO2 molecule which takes values of 0 or 1. Pi(t0,t) equals to 1 if CO2 molecules are
marked as adsorbed on the surface of amorphous LDOs at t0 and t, and it has not left out of the
specific distance for any continuous period between t0 and t. Under other circumstances, it
takes a value of 0. Δt is the time interval
at which the observation is made to check adsorption of the ith CO2. In this definition, t0 is updated if a CO2 molecule leaves the adsorption
layer and comes back to it. This means that each CO2 molecule
has multiple residence times, and we can calculate the number of adsorbed
CO2 within a specific time window. Figure 10 shows the typical semilog plot of residence
time versus amount of adsorbed CO2 for LDO with Mg/Al =
3.0 at P = 50 bar. Dynamic adsorption analysis performed
in lower pressure show similar trends; thus, we present only the results
corresponding to P = 50 bar to avoid redundancy.
As mentioned before, using the highest pressure at which CO2 acts as a good gas also enables us to access to better statistics.

Figure 10 Dependence
on the residence time of adsorbed CO2 on
the amount of adsorbed CO2. The inset shows the adsorption
amount as a function of LDO’s composition. Our uncertainty
estimate is based on a 95% confidence interval.

Previous study suggests that individual CO2 molecules
could reside near the defects on the surface for an extended period
of time, and majority of CO2 molecules would dynamically
visit and leave the surface, which makes the residence time of CO2 a dynamic value.58 A cutoff distance
of 9 Å has been used to define a CO2 as adsorbed on
the surface for all six samples with different Mg/Al ratios. This
value is chosen according to density profile of CO2 near
the oxide surface (see Figure 9b). Three distinctive regions can be recognized in the residence
time diagram of CO2 molecules in Figure 10. In region I, there are a few number of
CO2 molecules with relatively long residence times for
more than 600 ps. In region III, CO2 molecules visit the
adsorption layer with high frequency but stay in this layer for short
periods of time. None of these two regions in the semilog plot shows
linear relationship. In region II, the residence time versus amount
of CO2 in semilog plot follows linear relationship; phenomenologically,
we can express the residence time as follows. 3  where τr represents the residence
time, n is the number of adsorbed molecules, and
⟨n⟩ is the average number of molecules
adsorbed on the surface. We believe that the region II represents
the steady-state adsorption behavior of CO2 on the surface.

To compare CO2 adsorption behavior between different
Mg/Al molar ratios, the number of average adsorbed CO2 in
region II was rescaled by the surface area of each composition, as
shown in the inset of Figure 10. This inset clearly shows that the dynamic adsorption behavior
of CO2 molecules on the LDH-derived amorphous LDOs is sensitive
to the Mg/Al molar ratio. Overall, with the increasing Al content,
the amount of average adsorbed CO2 increases and reaches
maximum when the Mg/Al molar ratio is equal to 3.0. Gao et al.18 also investigated the effect of the Mg/Al molar
ratio on CO2 adsorption at high temperatures, and our observations
here agree well with their experimental results. It is worth mentioning
that CO2 adsorption simulations in this study were performed
at room temperature, and the adsorption of CO2 at high
temperatures deserves further investigation.

3.4 CO2 Diffusion
The other
related dynamic property of CO2 adsorption is the diffusion
of molecules on the surface. The mean square displacement (MSD) of
CO2 was calculated for all CO2 molecules62 within a specified time interval Δt. The MSD was then defined as63 4  where N is the total number
of atoms and r(t0) is
the position of the atom at t0. The MSD
of carbon dioxide was calculated at five different temperatures from
240 to 350 K for each composition, and four representative MSD for
Mg/Al molar ratio of 3.0 are shown in Figure 11a.

Figure 11 (a) MSD vs time at different temperatures:
240, 260, 300, and 350
K for the Mg/Al molar ratio of 3.0. (b) Arrhenius temperature dependence
of diffusion coefficient for six different Mg/Al molar ratios: 1.0,
1.7, 2.2, 3.0, 3.7, and 4.5. The inset shows the activation energy
for diffusion as a function of Mg/Al molar ratio.

The slope of MSD versus time intervals is proportional to
the diffusion
coefficient D,64 and the
temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficients can be well approximated
by 5  where D0 is pre-exponential
factor and Q is the activation energy for diffusion. Figure 11b shows the Arrhenius
temperature dependence of diffusion coefficients along with the activation
energy for diffusion. The activation energy for diffusion obtained
in the current study falls into the same ballpark of previous studies.64−66 The inset shows that activation energy of CO2 diffusion
as a function of LDO composition, and it suggests that Mg/Al molar
ratio of 3.0 possesses the highest diffusion barrier. The result is
consistent with the results of the dynamic CO2 adsorption
analysis (see the inset of Figure 10).

3.5 Correlation between Structure
and Dynamics
Adsorption Behavior
Both dynamic adsorption behavior and
diffusion coefficient data point to the direction that the Mg/Al molar
ratio of 3.0 possesses the highest CO2 adsorption capacity.
How does this dynamic property relate to the amorphous LDO composition?
We further investigated the binding arrangement between CO2 and amorphous LDOs to examine the potential correlation. Bolognini
et al.26 demonstrated that the chemical
reaction between CO2 and Mg2+–O2– or Al3+–O2– pairs was a key
parameter for CO2 adsorption, and Yong and Rodrigues14 concluded that increasing the aluminum content
strongly affected CO2 adsorption because of larger partial
charge of Al. Unfortunately, in the MD simulation, we can only observe
physisorption; therefore, we examine the binding arrangement between
CO2 molecules and atoms on the surface. In the current
study, only heterocharges of amorphous LDO are considered, such as
Mg2+–O, Al3+–O, and O2––C, because homocharges will possess repulsive force between
CO2 molecules and amorphous LDO. Mg–O, Al–O,
and O(LDO)–C binding lengths are studied, as they interact
through relatively strong Columbic interaction, and the RDF of atoms
has been rescaled as follows67 6  where Npairs is
the number of pairs of atoms where one atom is from each of two selections.
Here, the Npairs for partial RDF is the
product of number of atoms of amorphous LDO (Mg, Al or O) and O or
C of CO2 molecules.

Figure 12 shows the rescaled partial RDF of atoms
on the surface of amorphous LDO with different Mg/Al molar ratios.
The pair RDF of Al–O indicates that the binding length of Al–O
is the longest, suggesting that aluminum atoms on the surface of amorphous
LDO possess weak interaction. It is also noticed that the binding
length of Mg–O is the shortest, which indicates that magnesium
atoms on the amorphous surface are mainly bound with the CO2 in the first adsorption layer. Figure 13 shows the integrated g*(r) of Mg2+, which is related to the
coordination number on the surface, in amorphous LDO in six different
Mg/Al molar ratios. It reveals that the binding between Mg2+ or O2– and CO2 is relatively high for
Mg/Al molar ratio = 3.0. This is also related to the fact that the
Mg in the bulk amorphous LDOs with a Mg/Al molar ratio of 3.0 have
higher coordination number and are on the surface, and they tend to
bind with more atoms, as suggested in Figure 6b. It shows that the integrated g*(r) between Mg2+ on the surface and
the first CO2 adsorption layer is the most predominant,
whereas the binding fraction of Al–O is negligible, which is
consistent with the results of partial RDF.

Figure 12 Partial RDFs of CO2 and amorphous LDO, (a) Mg/Al molar
ratio of 1.0 (b) Mg/Al molar ratio of 1.7 (c) Mg/Al molar ratio of
2.2, (d) Mg/Al molar ratio of 3.0, (e) Mg/Al molar ratio of 3.7, and
(f) Mg/Al molar ratio of 4.5. Mg–O and Al–O represent
the respective binding arrangement between CO2 and magnesium
and aluminum in the amorphous LDO, respectively, O(LDO)–C represents
the binding arrangement between CO2 and oxygen in the amorphous
LDO.

Figure 13 Integrated g*(r) of Mg2+ in amorphous LDO as a function of
Mg/Al molar ratio: 1.0, 1.7, 2.2,
3.0, 3.7, and 4.5. Mg–O represents the binding between Mg2+ and oxygen atoms of CO2; O(LDO)–C represents
binding between O2– of amorphous LDO and carbon
atoms of CO2; Al–O represents binding between Al3+ of amorphous LDO and oxygen atoms of CO2.

4 Conclusions
MD simulations were performed to investigate the structural change
of LDHs during the thermal treatment and CO2 adsorption
behavior on LDOs. The layered structure of LDHs began to collapse
at ∼800 K. The hydroxyl groups and anions were removed after
structural collapse, and amorphous LDOs were obtained. Amorphous LDOs
recrystallized at 1200 K and retained their crystalline structure
between 1200 and 1700 K. The crystalline structure of LDOs at 1200
K is close to that of periclase. With the increasing temperature,
LDOs melt to a liquid at 1700 K. The static and dynamic CO2 adsorption behavior of the amorphous LDOs with different Mg/Al ratios
was studied. We showed that most of the CO2 molecules were
captured within 9 Å from the surface and fewer CO2 molecules moved freely in the free space above the surface of amorphous
LDOs. Among the six different Mg/Al molar ratios used (1.0, 1.7, 2.2,
3.0, 3.7, and 4.5), a higher CO2 diffusion barrier was
found when the Mg/Al molar ratio was 3.0. The amount of adsorbed CO2 on amorphous LDOs was also the highest at the same molar
ratio, which was in agreement with previous experimental studies.18 As reported in Gao et al.,18 the CO2 adsorption capacity when Mg/Al ratio
is 3.0 is approximately 30% higher than that in ratio 1.7. However,
the ratio at 3.0 is only about 15% higher than that in ratio 1.7 in
current simulation study, and this discrepancy could be attributed
to the fact that the classical MD simulation deals only with interactions
such as columbic, van der Waals forces between molecules, that is,
physisorption, while both physisorption and chemisorption could be
important in experiments. The partial RDF of atoms on the surface
of amorphous LDO suggests that magnesium atoms contribute to the first-layer
CO2 capture. The binding arrangement between CO2 molecules and amorphous LDO surface indicates the binding between
magnesium and oxygen predominant in CO2 adsorption. A relatively
higher integrated g*(r) of Mg–O
and O(LDO)–C when the Mg/Al molar ratio is 3.0 indicates that
magnesium atoms incline to attract more of surrounding atoms, especially
oxygen. This result is supported by the fact that the g*(r) of Mg–O is also highest at the same
ratio. It can be concluded that the CO2 capture capacity
of amorphous LDOs is closely related to the Mg/Al molar ratio because
of the high value of g*(r). This
study describes a promising simulation method to investigate the characteristics
of LDHs and LDH-derived amorphous LDOs and the results provide molecular-scale
insight into the structural and dynamical origins of the interactions
of CO2 with LDOs. This can be helpful to design LDOs structures
with optimal CO2 capture capacities.
