The
design, synthesis, and characterization of a new class of blue-colored
thiophene-substituted Pechmann dyes are reported. Due to a distinguishing
blue coloration and the capability to absorb light in one of the most
photon-dense regions of the solar spectrum, such compounds are of
great interest for application as photoactive materials in organic
optoelectronics, in particular, in dye-sensitized solar cells. To
achieve fine tuning of the optical and electrochemical properties,
the electron-poor thiophene-bis-lactone moiety has been decorated
with donor (D) and acceptor groups (A), targeting fully conjugated
D–A−π–A structures. The designed structures
have been investigated by means of DFT and time-dependent DFT calculations,
and the most promising dyes have been synthesized. These molecules
represent the very first preparation of unsymmetrical Pechmann derivatives.
Optical and electrochemical properties of the new dyes have been studied
by cyclic voltammetry and UV–vis and fluorescence spectroscopy.
In two cases, test cells were built proving that a photocurrent can
indeed be generated when using electrolytes especially formulated
for narrow-band-gap dyes, although with a very low efficiency.

Introduction
Among new generation
photovoltaic technologies, dye-sensitized
solar cells (DSSC) are considered a promising option for the efficient
conversion of solar energy to electricity.1 The working principle2 of a DSSC is inspired
by natural photosynthesis as light harvesting is carried out by a
dye, which is absorbed on a thin-layer of a mesoporous semiconductor
(usually TiO2). Thanks to photoexcitation, an electron
is promoted from the HOMO of the dye to its LUMO and from there is
transferred to the conduction band of the semiconductor. Traveling
through an external circuit (thus generating an electric current),
the electron can be collected at the cathode, where the reduction
of a redox couple, such as iodide/triiodide, takes place. The original
state of the dye can be finally restored by electron donation from
the electrolyte, closing the circuit. Clearly, the photosensitizer
represents a key component of a DSSC, being responsible not only for
its photovoltaic performances but also for its appearance and for
some peculiar properties, such as transparency and color. Accordingly,
a large number of metal-free organic dyes have been designed, synthesized,
and tested for this kind of application,3 and in particular, donor−π bridge–acceptor (D−π–A)
structures showed desirable characteristics, including tunable optoelectronic
and electrochemical properties, simple molecular design, high molar
extinction coefficients, low cost, and simple synthetic and purification
methods. However, although very good power conversion efficiencies
(PCEs) have been reached,4,5 with record values exceeding
14%,6 further efforts are required to find
colorful, stable, and highly efficient organic dyes, especially when
aiming to increase the commercial appeal of DSSC technology for building
integration and indoor applications. In particular, blue and green
dyes would be of high commercial interest due to their lovely colors,
in turn derived from their ability to absorb the incident photons
in the red and near-infrared region (NIR) of the spectrum.7 Nevertheless, although the efficient conversion
of low energy photons (λ > 700 nm) is crucial for increasing
the overall PCE in a DSSC, only a few blue sensitizers have been reported
so far. In particular, some blue devices have been reported using
squaraine8 or diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based
sensitizers. Above all, the latter were able to give a satisfying
efficiency of 7.3% when assembled with the cobalt bipyridine-based
electrolytes, a value which was further increased to 8.7% using a
co-sensitization strategy with a red dye9 and even exceeded 10% in the presence of very bulky indoline donors.10 Very recently, a blue dye featuring an electron-rich
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) scaffold has also been reported
achieving a PCE of 12.6%.11 Clearly, there
are still significant possibilities of introducing structural modifications
in the sensitizers, in particular, in the search of new building blocks
capable of extending the range of available panchromatic dyes. In
this context, we have been intrigued by the possibility of introducing
the (E)-3,3′-bifuranylidene-2,2′-dione
heterocyclic systems (Pechmann lactone, Figure 1) in the π scaffold of the dye.

Figure 1 Pechmann and
aza-Pechmann molecular structures.

Actually, the Pechmann moiety is characterized by a planar
and
conjugated structure, which is a known requirement to promote charge
transport in organic electronic frameworks. Accordingly, Pechmann
bis-lactone and aza-Pechmann bis-lactam units have been exploited
to prepare conjugated systems of potential interest for organic electronics,12,13 for instance, as semiconductors in organic field-effect transistors
(OFET).14 Furthermore, quadrupolar D–A–D
systems based on Pechmann-lactone analogues were reported to show
highly intense and red-shifted visible–NIR absorption and fluorescence,15 whereas the aza-Pechmann moiety can be found,
together with diketopyrrolopyrrole, in photoactive donor–acceptor
polymers suitable for organic photovoltaic devices16 and also in small molecules that were used to build OFETs
with excellent hole mobilities.17

In this paper, we report the design of a new family of unsymmetrically
substituted Pechmann dyes for application in DSSCs. The dyes studied
differ both for the electron-rich substituents on the donor and for
the anchoring group (Figure 2). Using an approach which was successfully applied in previous
studies,18 the dyes were investigated by
means of density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT)
calculations, those with the most promising features were synthesized,
and their spectroscopic and electrochemical properties were experimentally
verified.

Results and Discussion
Dyes 1–13 (Figure 3) were designed with the aim to rationalize
the effect of decorating the central Pechmann scaffold with different
donor and acceptor groups. We mainly focused on thiophene-derived
Pechmann lactones (dyes 1–10) because
the thienyl substituent is ubiquitous in the structure of organic
semiconductors and photosensitizers. However, to have better insight,
some other aromatic and heteroaromatic rings such as xylenyl (11), fluorenyl (12), and pyrrolyl-(13) were considered (Figure 3), and the effect of conjugated spacers with different electron
densities was evaluated by placing phenyl (5 and 6), ethynylphenyl (7), and 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophenyl
(EDOT) (9 and 10) moieties between the anchoring
group and the central core. In addition, hydrophobic alkyl chains
were inserted to improve the solubility, reduce aggregation,19 and simplify the handling of the final compounds.
All the structures were endowed with triarylamine donor groups, differing
in terms of the presence of electron-rich substituents in the para position. In particular, unsubstituted triarylamine
compounds (1 and 8) were compared with p-hexyloxy- (3) and p-thiohexyl-substituted
ones (2, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10) because the latter are known
to have a beneficial reducing effect on aggregation and enhancing
effect on regeneration of the dyes.19a,19b,20,21 Finally, the Pechmann
lactone scaffold was substituted with the aza-Pechmann
one in compounds 4 and 8.

Computational Studies
To assess
the optoelectronic
properties of the selected Pechmann-based structures and verify that
their energy levels match the semiconductor conduction band and the
redox couple potential, it was essential to model the relative energies
of their frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) and their UV–vis
absorption maxima. All quantum mechanics (QM) calculations were performed
using the Gaussian 09 program package.22 Geometry optimizations of Pechmann-based dyes (1–13, Figure 3) were carried out by DFT calculations using the Becke three-parameter-Lee–Yang–Parr
(B3LYP) hybrid-DFT exchange-correlation functional23 in combination with the standard 6-31G* basis set in the
gas phase. The values of the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps for all
the computed structures are reported along with the wave function
plots of corresponding FMOs. Vertical excitation energies (Eexc), absorption maxima (λmax), and oscillator strengths (f) were computed at
the time-dependent DFT (CAMB3LYP/6-31G*) level on all the optimized
structures. To include the effect of the solvent (CHCl3), the polarized continuum model (PCM) was employed.24 Finally, methyl groups have been used in place of the alkyl
chains to reduce the computational cost. The energy and shape of FMOs
for 1–13 are shown in Figure 4, along with the known D−π–A
sensitizer DF15,25 which was
used as reference. As we expected, and in comparison to DF15, the introduction of the Pechmann unit, which is an auxiliary acceptor
group in the π bridge of the molecules, lowered the energy of
the LUMO orbitals, consequently reducing the HOMO–LUMO gaps,
which were in the range of 1.45–1.78 eV. Similarly to other
D–A−π–A dyes,26 the HOMO/LUMO orbitals of compounds 1–13 were mostly localized on the donor and acceptor, respectively,
but both also stretched onto the Pechmann unit, giving rise to an
extended superimposition, suggesting strong intramolecular charge
transfer upon photoexcitation. Comparing the different structures,
it appears that the substitution of the lactone moiety with the less
electron-withdrawing lactam (4 vs 3 and 8 vs 1) raised the energy of both frontier molecular
orbitals, even if the consequent increase of the HOMO–LUMO
gap (from 1.49 eV for dye 3 to 1.72 eV for dye 4 and from 1.62 eV for dye 1 to 1.78 eV for dye 8; see Figure 4) was especially due to the larger positive shift of the LUMO orbital.

Figure 4 Energy
levels and electron density distributions of FMOs of compounds 1–13.

As expected, the introduction of a stronger donor group (dyes 2 and 3 vs dye 1) raised the energy
of the HOMO orbital, lowering the HOMO–LUMO gap, whereas the
presence of different spacers between the anchoring unit and the central
core (dyes 5 and 10 vs dye 2) affected the energy of the LUMO orbital, with a slight increase
of the HOMO–LUMO gap. The same effect was produced by the substitution
of the cyanoacrylic acid with a simple carboxylic acid (dyes 6 and 7 vs dye 5; dye 9 vs dye 10). In the case of dyes 6 and 7, the shape of the LUMO was also different, with a smaller
contribution of the actual anchoring group, probably as a consequence
of the less electron-withdrawing nature of the acceptor. Finally,
substitution of the thienyl rings with different aromatic and heteroaromatic
moieties (dyes 11–13 vs dye 2) changed the energy levels of both the frontier molecular
orbitals, without altering the HOMO–LUMO gap dramatically.
Also, in the case of dyes 11 and 12, we
observed a more limited localization of the LUMO on the anchoring
group; however, because in this case the latter was the same as those
of dyes 1–4 and 8, the
reason could not be ascribed to its weaker electron-accepting ability
but rather to the smaller planarity of the conjugated system, especially
between the π bridge and the acceptor moiety (see Figure S25).

Assuming that the commonly accepted
value is −4.0 eV for
the energy of the TiO2 conduction band,1 ΔGinject values were
negative for all sensitizers, indicating that electron injection from
the dye to TiO2 is predicted to be thermodynamically favored.

The most negative ΔGinject values
belong to dyes 11 and 12, which have also
the lowest computed absorption maxima (λmax = 576–585
nm), due to the fact that the most influential electronic transition
occurs from the HOMO–1 to LUMO
level and to dyes 4, 6, and 8, whose LUMO orbitals have the least negative values. The high and
similar values (0.98–0.99) for LHE suggest that all dyes are,
in principle, able to maximize the photocurrent response. We can thus
conclude that the computational design suggested that almost all of
dyes 1–13 are suitable sensitizers
for DSSC application. In particular, there is an appropriate alignment
of the dyes’ energy levels: vertical absorption maxima ranging
from 600 to 800 nm (except for dyes 11 and 12) confirm their red to infrared light absorption, high oscillator
strength values suggest large molar extinction coefficients, and wave
function plots of frontier molecular orbitals involved in the excitation
process are in favor of an intramolecular charge-transfer nature of
the excitation.

Synthesis of the Pechmann Dyes
Not
all the thirteen
calculated dyes were synthesized. Taking into account the computational
results, we decided to exclude dyes 11 and 12 due to their insufficient NIR light absorption. Among the remaining
dyes, we selected compounds 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8 (see Figure 3). Compound 1 was
selected as a reference, and compound 2 was preferred
over compound 3 to take advantage of the possible beneficial
enhancing effect of thiohexyl chains on dye regeneration.19b,21 Similarly, between dyes 4 and 8, where
the bis-lactone unit is substituted with the aza-Pechmann core, we
selected only compound 8 to be compared with 1. Finally, we focused on dyes 6 and 7,
having a simple carboxylic anchoring group and less electron-rich
phenyl or ethynylphenyl spacers, to be compared with 2. As mentioned above, in the case of dyes 6 and 7, the contribution of the actual anchoring groups to their
LUMO orbitals was inferior to those shown by the corresponding cyanoacrylic
dyes. Nevertheless, we still decided to prepare and test them based
on the following considerations: (a) They had more negative calculated
ΔGinject values and higher LUMO
levels than dyes 1 and 2, and therefore,
we supposed that they could still display a significant charge injection
capability owing to a larger driving force. (b) Charge injection into
TiO2 was previously demonstrated also in cases where the
LUMO orbital of the dye was spatially separated from the semiconductor
surface: an example is the highly performing ADEKA-1 dye
described by Kakiage et al.6 (for which
efficiencies up to 12.5% were reported when used alone).27 Furthermore, electron transfer to a semiconductor
was observed also for dyes (both organic and organometallic) whose
main chromophore was separated from the anchoring group by a saturated
carbon chain, albeit at a reduced rate compared to the fully conjugated
compounds.28

The synthetic approach
to all the dyes started with the preparation of the common intermediate
dibromide 17, which can be obtained, following our optimized
procedure,29 by bromination of thienyl
lactone 16, in turn obtained by reaction of 2,4-dihexylthiophene
(14) and maleic anhydride (see Scheme 1) and subsequent cyclization of the resulting
4-oxobut-2-enoic acid 15. Except for a recent polymerization
study,14a the synthetic elaboration of
Pechmann lactones has not been previously reported. In addition, all
derivatives described so far are symmetrical, and the desymmetrization
of the central Pechmann chromophore to obtain nonsymmetrical D−π–A
or similar structures has never been attempted. Very recently, we
described the preparation of some symmetrically functionalized Pechmann
lactones following a procedure entailing Stille–Migita cross-coupling
between dibromide 17 and a suitable stannane.29 The experimental procedure we used, being performed
in very mild conditions and without bases, proved a suitable tool
for the synthetic elaboration of the very sensitive bis-lactone scaffold,
and thus we decided to use a similar approach also to prepare compounds 1 and 2. We started with the introduction of
the donor groups, which implies the desymmetrization of the central
Pechmann scaffold 17. Reaction with stannanes 18a,b was then performed, following a slightly modified
version of our cross-coupling procedure.29 Accordingly, the Stille–Migita reactions were carried out
using a stoichiometric amount of the stannanes and stopped before
the complete conversion of the starting material, to avoid the formation
of the symmetric double-coupling product. For this reason, the desired
products 19a,b could be obtained only in
25–27% yield, even though the starting dibromide 17 could always be partially recovered after chromatographic purification,
and recycled for further use. The acceptor group was then introduced
by a second Stille–Migita reaction using organostannane 20. In both cases, the desired aldehydes 21a,b were obtained in good yields. The last step of the synthesis
required Knoevenagel condensation to obtain cyanoacrylic acids. Considering
that the Pechmann core proved to be quite sensitive to the presence
of excess acetic acid, we needed to modify the standard reaction conditions,
which commonly require using a mixture of toluene and acetic acid
as the solvent and a large excess of cyanoacetic acid and ammonium
acetate.30 Instead, we decided to use a
stoichiometric amount of piperidine25 as
the base and a mixture of toluene and acetonitrile as the solvent.
In this way, provided that the reaction is stopped before the complete
conversion of the starting materials to minimize degradation, we have
been able to recover the desired dyes 1 and 2 in 37 and 62% isolated yield, respectively (Scheme 2).1

the Pechmann Scaffold
Scheme 2 Preparation of Nonsymmetrical Pechmann Derivatives 1 and 2
Advanced intermediate 19b was also used to
prepare
the two dyes 6 and 7 (Scheme 3). Following the usual procedure, reaction
with organostannane 22(31) gave
compound 6 in good yield after purification (Scheme 3).On the other hand,
compound 7 was prepared by coupling 19b with
the unprotected 4-ethynylbenzoic acid 23, following standard
Sonogashira conditions, that is, Pd(PPh3)4 as
the catalyst, CuI as the co-catalyst, and Et3N as the base.32

Scheme 3 Preparation of Nonsymmetrical Pechmann Derivatives 6 and 7
Finally, to synthesize compound 8, lactone 16 was reacted overnight with a 4-fold excess of n-C6H13NH2 and 20% DMAP in DCM, followed
by acidification with TsOH·H2O (Scheme 4)13a to obtain
lactam 25. Unfortunately, attempts to prepare dibromide 24 by standard bromination of 25 failed, and
only decomposition products were recovered even after a very short
reaction time. Therefore, we decided to convert directly dibromo bis-lactone 17 into bis-lactam 24. Using the same amidation
conditions, pure intermediate 24 was indeed recovered
after chromatography, although in moderate yield. To end the synthesis,
the usual approach was followed, performing two subsequent cross-coupling
reactions, using stannane 18a first and then stannane 20. Although in both cases, lactam derivatives showed a lower
reactivity compared to their lactone analogues and higher reaction
temperature and longer times were required, the desired dye 8 was indeed obtained in a pure form and with a reasonable
overall yield. Surprisingly, dye 8 was quite unstable,
rapidly turning from green (see below) to pale yellow upon dissolution
in the most common solvents. We tentatively attribute such behavior
to the ring opening of the lactam moiety (possibly followed by ring
closure to a different isomer), which has been reported to yield species
characterized by weaker and blue-shifted absorption spectra compared
to the Pechmann chromophore.12,13

Derivative 8
Spectroscopic and Electrochemical Data
The optical
properties of all the new dyes were studied. First of all, the UV–vis
spectra of dye 1 and all its synthetic intermediates
containing the Pechmann moiety (namely, 16, 17, 19a, and 21a) were recorded in CHCl3 solution (Figure 5a). The comparison clearly shows the red shift and widening
of the absorption bands, due to the elongation of the conjugated skeleton
and the formation of the alternating D–A structure, with the
color of the compounds progressively shifting from violet to cyan
(Figure 5b). This trend
was finely predicted by the TD-DFT study (see Supporting Information, Table S2). UV–vis spectra of
dyes 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8 were then recorded, both in CHCl3 solution and after adsorption on TiO2 (Figure 6a,b and Table 3). Again, the values we found are in very
good agreement with those obtained from the DFT/TD-DFT study (Table 1). As expected, 1, 2, 6, and 7 showed
an intense cyan color in solution due to their broad absorption of
red/NIR light. In particular, dyes 1 and 2 showed the most red-shifted absorption with a maximum value of λ
= 681 nm registered for 2, due to the strong electron-donating
character of the thioalkyl substituent. On the other hand, the presence
of less electron-withdrawing anchoring groups such as for dyes 6 and 7 resulted in a blue shift of the absorption
maxima, which is more pronounced in the case of 6 probably
because of a loss of planarity, which might hamper conjugation between
the thienyl group of the central scaffold and the benzoic acid substituent.
Finally, bis-lactam-based compound 8 presented a blue-shifted
and much less intense low-energy absorption band compared to its bis-lactone
analogue 1 (1.6 × 104 vs 5.9 × 104 M–1 cm–1), which was
accompanied by a higher energy absorption band of similar intensity
(2.0 × 104 M–1 cm–1) at 433 nm. As a consequence, the corresponding CHCl3 solution displayed an intense green rather than cyan color (Figure 6a).

d Obtained by means of the following
expression: ES+/S* = ES+/S – E0–0.

e ES+/S and ES+/S* were not measured due to
decomposition of compound 8.

All dyes exhibited fluorescence in CHCl3 solution (Figures S26–S30); therefore,
optical band
gaps (E0–0) could be obtained from
the intersection of the normalized absorption and emission spectra
and were found in the 1.68–1.80 eV range (Table 3), with 1 and 2 having the smallest E0–0 values. A very wide absorption band (500–850 nm) was observed
when the dyes were adsorbed on the TiO2 layer. This was
accompanied by a moderate blue shift of the maximum absorption peak,
probably due to partial aggregation.33 Interestingly,
the only exception was observed for dye 8, for which
a slight red shift was observed (612 vs 608 nm in CHCl3 solution), possibly due to the presence of two additional linear
hexyl chains (bonded to the lactam nitrogen atoms) on its molecular
structure, which might have a limiting effect on the incidence of
aggregation phenomena.19a,19b As already outlined,
in the case of dye 8, we observed a rapid change in color
from green to pale yellow after dissolution in most of the common
solvents or adsorption on TiO2 which hampered any further
analysis. The ground-state oxidation potentials (ES+/S) of the dyes were then measured by means of cyclic
voltammetry (CV), which was carried out in dichloromethane solutions
in the presence of 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 as the electrolyte
(Figures S31–S34 and Table 3).

ES+/S values ranging from 1.02 to 1.10
V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) were found, and consequently,
driving forces for the regeneration from the I–/I3– redox couple (ΔGreg) were over 670 mV.

Because overpotentials of
approximately 500 mV are required for
efficient dye regeneration from the iodide/triiodide electrolyte,34 the electron transfer from the redox shuttle
to the oxidized dyes is expected to work well. Indeed, the excited-state
oxidation potential (ES+/S*) is a crucial
parameter to assess the electron injection efficiency from the excited
state of the dye to the conduction band (CB) of titania and was calculated
using the following equation  All the calculated ES+/S* values are
in the range −0.58 to −0.75
V versus NHE (Table 3). In Figure 7, the
comparison of ground-state and excited-state oxidation potentials
of dyes 1 and 2 and 6 and 7 with the TiO2 CB (−0.50 V vs NHE) and
the iodide/triiodide redox couple (0.35 V vs NHE)35 potentials is reported, together with that of the DF15 reference dye.25 Clearly,
the driving force for electron injection (ΔGinject) ranges from ∼80 to 250 mV, values that
are lower than 300 mV, which is the optimal driving force to have
fast kinetics of electron injection in the TiO2 layer,7,34 but are comparable or superior to the minimum overpotential, which
is estimated to be ∼100 to 150 mV (Figure 7).34,36

This situation is unfortunately
common in narrow-band-gap dyes,
especially those containing strong electron-deficient π bridges
(see for instance thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine-based dyes),18d,37 resulting in low efficiency of the corresponding devices. Very often,
in these cases, the ΔGinject can
be increased by using special precautions in fabricating solar cells.

Photovoltaic Measurements
To assess the capability
of the new compounds to yield working DSSCs, we decided to carry out
a preliminary study and built some solar devices using dyes 6 and 7. We selected these two dyes because,
relying on the values of excited state potentials (ES+/S*), they were the only ones able to guarantee the
minimum required overpotential with respect to the TiO2 conduction layer, with dye 8 being too unstable to
be used in the experimental conditions required.

Initially,
we built test cells using standard conditions: photoanodes of different
thicknesses were sensitized with compound 6, and a standard
high-performance electrolyte38 was used.
No photocurrent was recorded in such conditions. However, the electrolyte
we used contains special additives (i.e., tert-butyl
pyridine and guanidinium isothiocyanate GuSCN), which are usually
present with the aim of increasing Voc by enhancing the TiO2 CB potential. This feature is not
compatible with dyes having a low injection overpotential; thus, we
decided to try to investigate different electrolyte compositions.
In particular, six different electrolytes were tested, sensitizing
the electrodes with dye 6, and the three best-performing
compositions were also tested using dye 7. The power
conversion efficiency, η, was calculated using the following
equation 5  where Jsc is the short-circuit photocurrent
density, Voc is the open-circuit photovoltage,
FF is the fill factor,
and I0 is the energy of incident sunlight
(100 mW cm–2). The results obtained are summarized
in Table 4. It is evident
that for all the cells prepared, a very low efficiency was recorded;
however, in the case of dye 6, even with a simple electrolyte
containing only the redox couple (A), a low photocurrent was observed.
LiI and guanidinium thiocyanate were then added, which are often used
to increase both Voc and the short-circuit
photocurrent (Jsc).39,40 Indeed, a moderate concentration of guanidinium thiocyanate (B)
increased Voc values without affecting
the photocurrent, whereas a higher concentration of guanidinium thiocyanate
(C) was detrimental to both. Addition of the bulky cation 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
(BMI+) and the innocent anion ClO4– (D), as expected, slowed down the recombination processes increasing
the photovoltage;41 however, it did not
give a better efficiency. Increasing the concentration of Li+ to 1.025 M (E) and 1.625 M (F) gave, as we expected, higher photocurrents,
with the best results occurring with electrolyte E, corresponding
also with the best efficiency recorded. When electrodes were sensitized
with dye 7, the effect of the additives was detrimental
in all cases, and cells built using the simple electrolyte A resulted
in the best performing ones. This different behavior of dye 7 might be due to its lower excited state potential (see Table 3), which makes any
attempt to enhance the electron injection process ineffective. Representative J/V curves for the best devices built with
dyes 6 and 7 are reported in Figure S35.

solvent was acetonitrile/valeronitrile (85/15, v/v).

b Data refer to the best results obtained
for at least three devices for each configuration.

In any case, the low efficiencies
recorded were mostly due to low
photocurrents. Recalling the results of our computational analysis,
it is possible that the scarce delocalization of the LUMO orbitals
of dyes 6 and 7 on their actual anchoring
groups, coupled with the abovementioned small driving forces, limited
their charge injection efficiency, reducing its rate and making it
competitive with recombination reactions as well as unproductive intermolecular
energy transfer processes.

Conclusions
Thirteen
new thiophene-substituted Pechmann dyes have been designed,
intended to evaluate the effect of decorating the central scaffold
with different donor (D) and acceptor (A) groups on their physico-
and electrochemical properties. Such an approach was aimed at preparing
new D–A−π–A structures suitable for application
as sensitizers for DSSCs because increased knowledge in choosing an
appropriate combination of D/A moieties and exploitation of new building
blocks are essential for the development of high-performance devices.

The designed structures were investigated by means of DFT and TD-DFT
calculations to evaluate the red to NIR absorption maxima, the proper
alignment of their FMO energies compared to the CB of TiO2 and the I–/I3– redox
potential, and the intramolecular charge-transfer nature of the excitation.
Calculations suggested that almost all the designed dyes were suitable
for application in DSSCs. Five of these new dyes were prepared using
an approach that was based on bromination of the central Pechmann
core and desymmetrization by running Stille–Migita cross-coupling
in strictly stoichiometric conditions and stopping the reaction before
complete consumption of the starting material. Further elaboration
of the resulting intermediates led to the preparation of D–A−π–A
compounds constituting, to the best of our knowledge, the first example
of synthesis of unsymmetrical Pechmann (or aza-Pechmann) derivatives.
In agreement with DFT computational studies, the new dyes showed intense
absorption of light in the NIR region of the spectrum, accompanied
by a significant degree of intramolecular charge transfer. Unfortunately,
the driving force for electron injection (ΔGinject) of such dyes was found to be too low to have fast
kinetics of electron injection. This is in agreement with the very
low efficiencies given by test cells built using two representative
dyes (6 and 7), whose charge injection capabilities
were also probably hampered by insufficient LUMO delocalization, caused
by the weak electron-withdrawing nature of their anchoring groups.
Nevertheless, a photocurrent increase could still be observed in the
presence of electrolytes especially formulated for narrow-band-gap
dyes with low ES+/S*. The results of these
preliminary investigations provide a basic understanding of the properties
of D–A−π–A dyes based on the Pechmann chromophore
and should be useful to stimulate further research directed toward
structural refinement of the sensitizers and optimization of device
characteristics.

Experimental Section
Unless otherwise
stated, all reagents were purchased from commercial
suppliers and used without purification. Dibromide 17 and stannanes 18a, 18b, 20,29 and 22(31a) were prepared as reported. All air-sensitive reactions
were performed using Schlenk techniques. Solvents used in cross-coupling
reactions were previously degassed by means of the “freeze–pump–thaw”
method. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was freshly distilled immediately before
use from sodium/benzophenone. CH2Cl2 and triethylamine
were distilled over CaH2, and toluene and acetonitrile
were dried on a resin exchange solvent purification system. Petroleum
ether, unless specified, is the 40–70 °C boiling fraction.
Reactions were monitored by TLC on SiO2 plates, and detection
was made using a KMnO4 basic solution or a UV lamp. The
organic phase derived from aqueous workup was dried over Na2SO4. Flash column chromatography was performed using glass
columns (10–50 mm wide) and SiO2 (230–400
mesh).1H-NMR spectra recorded at 300 or 400 MHz and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded at 75.5 or 100.6 MHz, respectively.
Chemical shifts were referenced to the residual solvent peak (CDCl3, δ 7.26 ppm for 1H-NMR and δ 77.16
ppm for 13C-NMR; THF-d8, δ
1.72 and 3.58 ppm for 1H-NMR and δ 67.21 and 25.31
ppm for 13C-NMR; C6D6, δ 7.16
ppm for 1H-NMR and δ 128.06 ppm for 13C-NMR). Coupling constants (J) were reported in
Hz. ESI-MS analyses were recorded with an LCQ-Fleet ion-trap mass
spectrometer. HR-MS analyses were performed using a LTQ Orbitrap FT-MS
spectrometer. FT-IR spectra were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum
BX instrument in the range 4000–400 cm–1 with
2 cm–1 resolution. UV–vis spectra were recorded
with a Varian Cary 400 spectrometer and a Shimadzu 2600 series spectrometer,
and fluorescence spectra were recorded with a Varian Eclipse instrument,
irradiating the sample at the wavelength corresponding to the maximum
absorption in the UV spectrum. In all electrochemical experiments,
N2-saturated solutions of the compound under study were
used with [Bu4N][PF6] (0.1 M) as the supporting
electrolyte (Fluka, electrochemical grade) and freshly distilled dichloromethane.
Cyclic voltammetry was performed in a three-electrode cell using a
glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum counter electrode, and
a AgCl/Ag (NaCl 3 M) reference electrode. A BAS 100 W electrochemical
analyzer was used as the polarizing unit. All the potential values
are referred to the NHE ([E vs NHE] = [E vs Ag/AgCl (NaCl 3 M) +0.21] V). Typical analyte concentration was
10–3 M. Ferrocene was used as the external standard
(+0.44 V vs Ag/AgCl).

product was purified by flash column chromatography.
