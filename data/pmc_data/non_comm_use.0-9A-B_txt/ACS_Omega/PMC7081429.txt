Reliable
hardware connectivity is vital in heterogeneous integrated
systems. For example, in digital microfluidics lab-on-a-chip systems,
there are hundreds of physical connections required between a microelectromechanical
fabricated device and the driving system that can be remotely located
on a printed circuit board. Unfortunately, the connection reliability
cannot be checked or monitored by vision-based detection methods that
are commonly used in the semiconductor industry. Therefore, a sensing
platform that can be seamlessly integrated into existing digital microfluidics
systems and provide real-time monitoring of multiconnectivity is highly
desired. Here, we report an impedance sensing platform that can provide
fast detection of a single physical connection in timescales of milliseconds.
Once connectivity is established, the same setup can be used to determine
the droplet location. The sensing system can be scaled up to support
multiple channels or applied to other heterogeneously integrated systems
that require real-time monitoring and diagnostics of multiconnectivity
systems.

Introduction
The use of single semiconductor
technology routes, such as complementary
metal-oxide semiconductors1 (CMOSs) for
high-speed circuits, insulated-gate bipolar transistors2 (IGBTs) for high-power applications, and thin-film
transistors (TFTs) for large-area and flexible electronics,3 while they are necessary, can no longer be deemed
sufficient in terms of requirements for complex systems in real-life
applications. Heterogeneous electronics that integrate more than a
single technology route is becoming the realistic engineering solution
for realization of complex systems. Interconnection methods that reliably
link different technology platforms are becoming key to successfully
integrate heterogeneous systems. Here, reliability in connectivity
is essential so as to achieve a long system lifetime.

Digital
microfluidics (DMF) is a typical demonstration of a heterogeneously
integrated system that consists of a microelectromechanical system
(MEMS)-based microfluidic device, co-integrated with a CMOS-based
peripheral circuits or drive electronics.4−6 By feeding sequenced
voltage signals through the peripheral circuits to an on-chip electrode
array, a DMF chip can enable complex manipulation of each discrete
droplet. The platform can support a wide range of applications,7−9 which allows the possibility to enable true lab-on-a-chip (LOC)
functions. One advantage of the DMF over other LOC methods is that
no prefabricated microchannels are required, and the liquid droplets
are manipulated over a two-dimensional region by electrostatic forces.10−13 However, this requires that the droplets be controlled on top of
the area where electrodes are physically located. A large number of
electrodes, or an electrode array, is necessary for a complex biomedical
procedure that requires simultaneous control of multiple liquid samples.14 In most reported systems, the electrodes are
individually connected to the driving electronics, and the number
of physical connections increases as the number of electrodes scales
up. Although the connection number can be reduced by introducing a
thin-film electronics-based active matrix technique,14,15 the increased device fabrication cost makes it difficult to be widely
applied. In addition, a DMF device is often designed as a disposable
part that needs to be replaced after a biochemical reaction due to
biofouling.16 Therefore, the reliability
of the multiple connections between a DMF device and the driving electronics
must be checked after every connection.

Here, we report an impedance
sensing technique for heterogeneously
integrated systems, in which we demonstrate seamless integration of
square-wave impedance sensing with a standard DMF system. For the
first time, we realize real-time monitoring of the reliability of
multiple connections between a microfluidics device and the driving
electronics. In addition, by tuning the sensing parameters, we can
use the same setup to detect the locations of the sample droplets.
The system we report in this work has 180 connections using a flexible
printed circuit board (FPC), and the system can be further upgraded
to support more connections.

Theory
Impedance-Based Sensing Principles
Some previous works
also engaged impedance-based sensing on DMF devices.17−19 As shown in Figure 1a, a typical DMF system consists of a microfluidics chip and the
drive electronics. The two parts are physically connected by a multicontact
connector. Different DMF device architectures are available, but the
double-plate structure is the most commonly used for biochemical reactions.20−23 The top plate has a common electrode, and the bottom plate hosts
the electrode array. The driving electronics contain at least a power
source, switching unit, and microcontroller (MCU). The MCU instructs
the switches to feed power in a certain sequence, and the output of
the switches is connected to each individual electrode on the bottom
plate. The top plate in the conventional setup is grounded to provide
zero potential to both the aqueous droplet and the surrounding medium. Figure 1b depicts the cross-sectional
view of the device. The aqueous droplet sits on one electrode and
is surrounded by the medium. Figure 1c shows the equivalent circuit for a device where the
capacitance of the thin hydrophobic layer is neglected.

unit. (a) System diagram for conventional DMF; sensing unit is added

view of a double-plate DMF device. (c) Equivalent impedance models
for the DMF device with the sample droplet and medium. (d) Impedance
measurement setup for different DUTs. (e) Impedance measurement results.

The detailed design and fabrication procedure of
the DMF device
can be found in the Experimental Methods section.
We considered one bottom electrode and the top electrode as a two-terminal
device under test (DUT). We performed four sets of impedance spectroscopy
measurements, as shown in Figure 1d. The analyzer testing probes were unconnected to
simulate the impedance of an open electrode connection (DUT1). When
connected, the probes measured DUT2 (air medium), DUT3 (silicon oil
medium), and DUT4 (aqueous droplet). Figure 1e depicts the impedance measurements for
the four DUTs. All data show a pure capacitive behavior whereby the
magnitudes of the measured impedance decrease linearly with increasing
stimulus frequency. The aqueous droplet shows the smallest impedance
value of all four DUTs due to the relatively large dielectric constant
of the aqueous solution,24 which is normally
around 80. The impedance measurements for air and silicon oil are
almost the same since the relative dielectric constant of silicon
oil25 is approximately 2, which is very
close to that of air. For DUT1, which represents an open circuit,
and the measured impedance indicates impedance analyzer’s detection
limit or noise floor. The results in Figure 1e clearly show that there are sufficient
margins for the impedance sensing system to identify the status of
the channel, that is, open circuit, connected with the medium and
connected with aqueous droplets.

Hardware and Software Design
Considerations for Sensing
We designed the driving electronics
based on an STM32 development
board with a customized power source and switches; please refer to
the Experimental Methods section for the details.
The driving system is able to control 180 channels with a DC voltage
or a square wave up to 200 kHz. The voltage output range is 60–300
V. We used 280 V DC voltage to manipulate the sample, which turns
out to be the best driving voltage on this platform. By using the
same power source for DMF droplet manipulation, we generated a square
wave (0 V to high V) as a stimulus in the impedance measurement for
sensing. We connected the top electrode from the DMF device as the
output terminal from the DUT. As shown in Figure 2a, we designed a sensor front-end circuit
that consists of a voltage buffer, a non-inverting summing amplifier,
and a voltage divider. The voltage buffer provides the sensed signal
with enough driving ability for the stages that follow. Together with
the equivalent capacitance from the DUTs, an RC circuit is formed,
which acts as a simple high-pass filter. The RC differentiator converts
the input square wave step signal into an output containing both positive
and negative elements. The non-inverting summing amplifier then levels
up the output for the next stage. The voltage divider is connected
to an analogue-to-digital converter (ADC), which is embedded in the
MCU within the DMF driving electronics. By tuning the design parameters,
the front end can convert a wide range of sensing signals to readable,
meaningful data for the ADC.

for the sensing unit.
(b) Flow chart for the sensing steps, including the algorithm in MATLAB-based
software. (c) ADC readout for DI water, silicon oil, and open circuit
(o.c.). (d) Bar chart of the extracted magnitude values for DI water,
silicon oil, and o.c.; possible regions for t1 and t2 are also indicated.

Figure 2b shows
the operational flow of the sensing unit, including both the hardware
and software sections. After the output signal from the front end
is acquired by the MCU-embedded ADC, we performed a fast Fourier transform
(FFT) to extract the magnitude of the output signal. Figure 2c shows the sensing output
waveforms for DUT1 (open circuit), DUT2 (connected with silicon oil
as medium), and DUT3 (connected with a DI water droplet) under a 180
V 12 kHz stimulus (see Supplementary Figure 1 for stimulus signal optimization). As expected, the magnitude of
DUT1 is much smaller than those of DUT2 and DUT3, which indicates
high impedance. The measured DUT2 and DUT3 values also show a clear
difference. This can be used to distinguish the droplet from the medium.
We performed measurements for all connected electrodes. The results
(see Supplementary Figure 2) show a high
level of uniformity. We used STM32H7 in this work with embedded ADC
at the 200 kHz sampling rate. We collected 256 sampling points to
perform the FFT calculation, and the overall timing for one-channel
detection was less than 2 ms. We used the value at 12 kHz (stimulus
frequency) as the magnitude (M). If M is greater than a pre-set threshold
value (t1), the undertested channel has
a secure connection between the electronics and the DMF device; otherwise,
the electrode will be shaded blue in the software to indicate a bad
connection. A second pre-set threshold value (t2) is used to determine whether an aqueous droplet (red shaded
in the software) or the medium is on top of the connected electrode. Figure 2d shows a bar chart
for the average magnitude values of all 169 connections with three
DUTs, clearly marking the possible margins for t1 and t2.

There are several
advantages for using FFT to extract the impedance
parameter in this work. First, we used the MCU to perform the calculations,
eliminating the requirement of additional circuits or elements. The
FFT calculation also shows a speed advantage where the single measurement
time (including data acquisition) is less than 2 ms in our setup.
In addition, FFT transforms signals from the time domain to the frequency
domain. We select only the magnitude of the stimulus frequency. This
method is able to filter all other elements that are mainly noise,
therefore enhancing the sensing accuracy.

In this work, we designed
an 8 × 8 × 8 hexagonal electrode
array containing 169 electrodes (as shown in Figure 3a,b) with electrodes divided into three zones
(A, B, and C) and connected to three 60-channel multiplexers. We also
assigned addresses to each individual electrode (Figure 3c) to synchronize the hardware
and software. A software interface was developed using a MATLAB platform,
and a 169-electrode array was plotted. We used a color code to indicate
the status of the different electrodes, in which blue indicates a
bad connection (open circuit), white as idle showing a good connection
with the medium on top of the channel, and red shows a good connection
with an aqueous droplet.

Results and Discussion
Connectivity
Detection
We used three FPCs to connect
the electrode array with the driving electronics. Each FPC contains
60 individual channels. First, we connected all three connectors (Figure 4a) and performed
a connection check. The 169 magnitudes are plotted in Figure 4b, where all the values are
higher than t1, indicating good connections.
Then, the FPCs were cut (as shown in Figure 4d) to create bad connections (open circuit)
for some of the channels. In Figure 4e, the corresponding measured magnitudes for the bad
connections are below t1. Figure 4f shows the indication of the
bad connection electrodes on the MATLAB interface. Finally, we disconnected
all three FPCs to leave all connections open (Figure 4g). All the measured data are below t1, and all electrodes on the MATLAB were marked
in blue for bad connections.

Droplet Detection
We used the same sensing unit to
detect the droplet location in real time. Figure 5a–f shows single droplet movement
and its real-time sensing results on the MATLAB. In our system, single
channel detection takes less than 2 ms, and the overall detection
time for 169 electrodes is approximately 300 ms. By adding a detection
interval between each movement step, the exact droplet location can
be determined. We performed the overall detection between each step,
and all available electrodes were measured. This arrangement also
supports multiple droplet detection. Figure 5g–m shows three droplet movements
and the corresponding detection results. The videos for the experiments
shown in Figure 5 are
presented in the Supporting Information.

path design. (b–f) Single droplet movement with real-time feedback
from the MATLAB interface. (g) Three droplet movement paths. (h–m)
Three droplets moved with real-time feedback.

The FFT-based approach is engaged here to enable the potential
to detect various kinds of samples or solution on the same chip. We
tested seven different samples on our chip using different frequencies
to find out the best frequency for detection as shown in Supplementary Figure 3. It turns out that DI
water, ethanol, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution (0.01 M),
bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution (2 mg/mL), and NaCl solution (0.1538
M) show the highest sensitivity at 12 kHz, while oleylamine shows
the highest sensitivity at 10 kHz, and octadecene shows the highest
sensitivity at 30 kHz. Frequency multiplexing can be used to detect
many droplets where various samples exist in a single chip. The resolution
of frequency is 200 K/256 = 781.25 Hz, and the resolution can be increased
by increasing sampling points.

Conclusions
We
have reported impedance sensing as a means for monitoring connectivity
in an LOC system that can be fully integrated into existing DMF driving
electronics. By measuring the impedance on the connectors, the system
can not only recognize bad connections but also determine the locations
of droplets. This work opens up a new frontier for dynamically monitoring
the reliability of heterogeneously integrated systems of multiconnectivity
with minimal effort. In addition, the impedance-based sensing platform
shows the potential to be used in other heterogeneous integrated systems.

Experimental
Methods
DMF Device Fabrication
We designed and fabricated double-plate
DMF devices in this work. The bottom plate was a standard printed
circuit board (PCB) with a hexagonal array of electrodes. Compared
to conventional square patterns, a hexagonal pattern is closer to
round shape, which would contribute less distortion for a liquid droplet
while manipulated by the EWOD device. We designed 169 hexagonal electrodes
and divided them into three zones. Three electrode zones were connected
to three 60-pin FPC connectors. The electrode diameter was approximately
2 mm. On top of the electrodes, we coated a 50 μm-thick polyethylene
(PE) film as the dielectric layer. Then, 0.9% Cytop (CTL-809M, AGC
Chemicals) was used as a hydrophobic coating for both the bottom plate
and an ITO-coated glass for the top plate. We defined a 200 μm
gap between the two plates using a Kapton spacer. We used 5 cSt silicon
oil from Dow Corning as the oil medium and DI water with food dye
for the aqueous droplets.

Electronics System
We used an STM32
by the ST NUCLEO-H743ZI
Development Board as the MCU to control the customized power source
and switches. We used three high-voltage solid-state multiplexers
(HV507 from Microchips), each of which is able to control 60 channels.
We used DMF software developed by ACXEL Tech Ltd., UK, for liquid
manipulation, which can preprogram the moving path of the droplet.
A MATLAB-based software interface was used for processing the sensing
results.
