Enhanced luminescence of an emitter
on a Ag film is usually ascribed
to the resonant surface plasmons. In these studies, the solid cadmium
sulfide (CdS) and cadmium selenide (CdSe) quantum dot/silver (QD/Ag)
hybrids were prepared, and the luminescence characteristics of these
QD/Ag hybrids were measured. It is found that the enhancement of the
trap state emission (TSE) is related to the QD size. The TSE features
of the annealed QD/Ag hybrids are insensitive to the morphology of
the Ag film. We used the wet and dry methods to separate the QD and
Ag components and found that the photoluminescence (PL) of the QD
component was permanently changed from the initial state. The PL modification
is ascribed to the Ag+ doping effect rather than the surface
plasmons. This doping method uses pure Ag as the Ag+ ion
source. In this case, though the CdS and CdSe QD/Ag hybrids are the
solid state, the cation exchange between Ag+ and Cd2+ ions can still occur on the QD surface. Even a small amount
of Ag can efficiently influence the luminescence of the QDs embedded
in the poly(methyl methacrylate) matrix. A hypothetical model was
proposed to explain the PL modification of the QD/Ag hybrid with and
without annealing. Using this dry method for doping, the transparent
luminescence label can be prepared easily, and the doped QDs can be
further doped with Ag+ dopants.

Introduction
Metal–semiconductor
hybrid materials have unique photoelectric
properties resulting from the complementary properties of their composite
materials.1,2 Several possible interactions between the
two components can influence the final properties, such as the coupling
of exciton-plasmons, the Schottky Junction, and chemical reactions
between the components. The fluorescent material may emit enhanced
luminescence when nearby a metal material, such as silver and gold.
The plasmonic effect has been proposed to explain metal-enhancement
phenomena.3,4

Quantum dots (QDs) are a kind of advanced
fluorophores that are
placed into the metal–semiconductor hybrid to research the
metal-enhanced luminescence. Cadmium selenide (CdSe) and cadmium sulfide
(CdS) are the most popular model QD systems because they have simple
composition and remarkable luminescence in the visual range. Silver
(Ag) is a versatile metal that can play several roles in the semiconductor–metal
hybrid, including a plasmonic metal and reflection mirror. The Ag-enhanced
luminescence is usually ascribed to the plasmonic effect because the
Ag has excellent plasmonic properties. The focused electromagnetic
field nearby the Ag nanostructure can influence the excitation and
emission of the fluorophore. However, the chemical reaction between
the metal and the QD is rarely discussed.2,5

QDs with dual emissions6−17 provide another way to tune the luminescence beyond the traditional
method.18,19 For a typical dual-color QD, besides the
band edge emission (BEE), other emissions may originate from surface
defect traps,6−8 shell traps9 and the dopant-related
trap levels.10−14 The Ag film can both enhance the emission of the nearby QDs and
influence the distribution of the BEE and the trap state emission
(TSE).15−17 We found that the CdS and CdSe QDs on the Ag film
have enhanced TSE and that the TSE enhancement was related to the
QD size and the annealing treatment;15−17 these methods thus provide
the post-synthetic modification of QD emission. It seems that the
Ag-enhanced TSE of II–VI QDs is a physical effect related to
the resonant plasmonic enhancement.15−17 Under this explanation,
the resonant plasmons in the Ag nanostructure altered the decay process
of the excited QD that resulted in the enhancement of TSE.

Based
on previous work about the optical properties of the II–VI
QD/Ag hybrid, we have done much work to unveil the mechanism between
the Ag nanostructure and II–VI QDs in the QD/Ag hybrid with
enhanced TSE. Increasing numbers of experimental results convince
us that the enhancement of the TSE is not the result of a plasmonic
effect, but instead, it is the result of a doping effect. Herein,
we discuss in detail the mechanism of the enhanced emission in CdSe
and CdS QD/Ag hybrids.

Results and Discussion
Size-Dependent Enhancement
of TSE of the QD/Ag Hybrid
Oleic acid (OA)-capped CdSe and
CdS QDs with zinc-blende structures
were used for researching the Ag-enhanced TSE. For each kind of QD,
two batches of QD were prepared, one batch of small QDs and one of
large size QDs. The BEEs for two CdS QD batches were 412 and 470 nm,
while those for CdSe QD batches were 486 and 560 nm, respectively
(Supporting Information, Figure S1). The
mean sizes of the 412 and 470 nm CdS QDs are 3.1 and 4.0 nm, and those
of the 486 and 560 nm CdSe QDs are 3.2 and 3.7 nm (Supporting Information, Figure S1). These QD batches were coated on the
Ag/Si substrates to form the QD/Ag hybrid, respectively.

Figure 1 displays the photoluminescence
(PL) spectra of the QD/Ag/Si structure with and without annealing
treatment. For each kind of QD, a size-dependent enhancement of the
TSE with and without annealing of the QD/Ag hybrid was evident. We
described this finding in our previous works.15,17 For the 412 nm CdS QDs, the unannealed QD/Ag hybrid presents a clearly
enhanced TSE at 526 nm and a suppressed BEE. Annealing quenched the
PL of the QD/Ag hybrid, and the distribution of the two peaks of the
QD/Ag hybrid returns to a line shape similar to the colloidal states
of 412 nm CdS QDs (Figure 1a). For the 470 nm CdS QDs on Ag, compared to the QD/Si sample,
the TSE (610 nm) of the unannealed QD/Ag sample is enhanced about
14 times (Figure 1d).
Annealing treatment further enhanced the TSE of the QD/Ag hybrid such
that the TSE (602 nm) dominates the PL spectra. The PL of the annealed
470 nm CdS QD/Ag is similar to the PL of the unannealed 412 nm CdS
QD/Ag.

Figure 1 PL spectra of the QD/Ag hybrid with and without annealing (a, d,
g, j) and the corresponding time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay curves (b,
e, h, k). The decay lifetimes of each curve are listed nearby. The
PL and TRPL curves (gray color) of the bare QDs on the Si chip are
also listed for comparison. (c, f, i, l) Commission internationale
de l’éclairage (CIE) coordinates of the above spectra
(the start of the arrow corresponds to the PL of the unannealed QD/Ag
hybrid and the end corresponds to the PL of annealed one).

The CdSe QD/Ag hybrids also show the analogous size-dependent
properties
compared with those of the CdS QD/Ag hybrids. For both CdS and CdSe
QDs with small size, unannealed QD/Ag have the dominant TSE. The TSE
lifetime of the unannealed QD/Ag is longer than that of the bare QD
(Figure 1b,h). Annealing
quenched the PL of the QD/Ag hybrid, thereby the TSE lifetime of the
annealed QD/Ag is shorter than that of the bare QD (Figure 1b,h). For the large size QDs,
the QD/Ag hybrids have the enhanced and long-decaying TSE compared
to the bare QD (Figure 1e,k). Annealing further elevates the PL intensity and the lifetime
of TSE of QD/Ag (Figure 1e,k).

This size-dependent enhancement of TSE is also reflected
in the
chromaticity chart in Figure 1c,f,i,l. Comparing Figure 1c,i, the CIE coordinates of the unannealed QD/Ag PL
spectrum are near the edge of the chart. This is due to the dominant
TSE on Ag (Figure 1a,g). Annealing quenched the TSE on Ag (Figure 1a,e) and shifted the CIE coordinates of PL
on Ag moving toward the coordinates of QD PL. In contrast, for the
large QDs (470 nm CdS and 560 nm CdSe QDs), annealing enhanced the
TSE on Ag intensely such that the CIE coordinates of the QD/Ag PL
spectrum move away from the coordinates of QD PL (Figure 1f,l).

In our previously
published studies,15−17 we considered that the
localized plasmons influence the final emission characteristics of
the QD/Ag hybrid. However, when the experimental data of CdS and CdSe
QDs are listed together (Figure 1), two confusing facts are clear. One is that the Ag
film enhances the TSEs of CdS and CdSe QDs at different wavelengths
instead of a special wavelength consistent between the two. It seems
that the peak of Ag-enhanced TSE (on Ag) is usually close to the TSE
of bare QDs (on Si). Different compositions and sizes of QDs result
in different enhancement effects on the same Ag film. The second confusing
fact is that the enhanced TSE always exhibits a longer lifetime than
that of the bare QDs, while the custom plasmon-enhanced PL corresponds
to the shorter lifetime.

The Unitary PL Character of QD/Ag Hybrids
Induced By Annealing
Treatment
Besides the size-dependent enhancement of the TSE,
another interesting phenomenon is that the TSE QDs show no preference
for Ag films with varied initial morphology. The PL characteristics
of 560 nm CdSe QDs on Ag films with different thicknesses and morphologies
were investigated. Ag films with four different surface morphologies
were prepared (Figure 2). (1) The as-deposited 6 nm Ag film. (2) The as-deposited 60 nm
Ag film. (3) A 60 nm Ag film stored in ambient air for several months.
(4) The Ag island film generated by annealing the as-deposited Ag
film (thickness 60 nm) at 180 °C. The scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of Ag nanostructures described above are listed on the
left in Figure 2b,d,f,h.
The 6 nm Ag film has a discrete surface composed of myriad Ag islands
(size ∼20 nm), whereas the 60 nm Ag film has a continuous surface
consisting of small Ag particles or grains (∼30 nm). For the
60 nm Ag film, one piece was stored in air for several months; the
color of the film became brown from sulfurization (Supporting Information, Figure S3). Compared to the fresh 60 nm Ag, the
sulfurized Ag film has a rough surface (Figure 2f).

The as-deposited 60 nm Ag film. (f) Ag film conserved in air more
than half a year. (h) Preannealed Ag island film.

The 560 nm CdSe QDs were coated on these substrates and the same
measurement was performed. Our previous work indicated that the QD
layer can etch the Ag film and that annealing can accelerate the etching
process (Supporting Information, Figure S3).15,17 For the annealed QD/Ag hybrid, the QD layer
was washed in toluene and the remaining Ag film can be observed. The
SEM images show that the annealing treatment increased the roughness
of the Ag film under the QD layer due to the QD etch.

For the
Ag film with varied morphologies, the annealed CdSe QD/Ag
samples have similar enhancement effects (enhanced TSE is located
at ∼640 nm) in Figure 2a,c,e,g. It is worth noting that the unannealed QD/Ag samples
have varied PL characters. The width of the enhanced TSE (∼110
nm) of the annealed hybrid is smaller than that of the TSE (∼150
nm) of the unannealed one. After annealing, the PL spectra of these
samples became similar. In other words, the PL of the annealed QDs/Ag
hybrid has a unitary character that is nonsensitive to the initial
morphology of Ag. This phenomenon is contradictory to that expected
according to the surface plasmons effect because the plasmonic properties
are sensitive to the micromorphology of the metal.

Previously,
we believed that the physical coupling in the QD/Ag
hybrid enhanced the TSE due to the fact that Ag films have excellent
plasmonic properties. Based on the current data, we need to find another
perspective. Ag is a versatile metal that can play multiple roles
in the metal–semiconductor hybrid. The doped QDs always have
the characteristic emission of dopant impurity. The Ag+ doping process may occur in the QD/Ag hybrid, which results in that
the annealed QD/Ag hybrids have similar dopant PL character.

Proof
of the Doping Hypothesis: Detaching the QDs and Ag Film
For
the phosphor-metal hybrid with plasmon-enhanced PL, the physical
interaction between the phosphor and the metal modifies the PL properties
of the hybrid. In other words, if the phosphor material was separated
from the metal, the enhanced emission should change back to its original
state. Consequently, we tried two methods to detach the QD component
and the Ag film to verify the reversibility of the QD emission.

For the first method, the QD/Ag structures with and without annealing
were soaked in toluene to dissolve the QD layer. The QD layer would
be dissolved in toluene and the Ag film still attached on the Si substrate.
This wet method transferred the solid QD layer to the liquid phase,
resulting in the separation of the QD and Ag film. The experimental
processes are presented in Figure 3a.

Figure 3 (a) Demonstration of the wet method for detaching the
560 nm CdSe
QDs and Ag film. First, the 560 nm CdSe QD dispersion was dropped
on the Ag/Si substrate. After the QD dispersion dried, the QD/Ag/Si
sample was cleaved into two parts. The upper part was not treated
and the lower part was annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. Then, these
two parts were immersed in toluene to collect the QDs. The photographs
were taken under ambient light and 365 nm UV light. (b) PL and absorption
spectra of 560 nm CdSe QDs (with and without annealing) detached from
the Ag film (the PL and absorption spectra of the 560 nm CdSe QD dispersion
with no treatment is displayed for reference). The photographs of
the 560 nm CdSe QD dispersion, the 560 nm CdSe QDs detached from unannealed
and annealed QD/Ag parts were taken under ambient light (upper part
of the inset) and 365 nm UV light (lower part of the inset). (c) Time-resolved
decay PL curves corresponding to the PL spectra in (b). The colors
of the decay curves are coherent with the PL curves in (b).

The 560 nm CdSe QDs dispersed in toluene were dropped
on the 60
nm Ag film and dried naturally. Under 365 nm UV light, the dried QDs,
which are attached at the edge of the substrate, have weak red emission,
whereas the liquid dispersed QDs have green emission. Once the QD
layer was dry, the sample was cleaved into two parts and one part
was annealed. The annealed QD/Ag piece exhibits red emission under
UV light (as mentioned above). Next, the two pieces were soaked in
toluene to collect the QDs. Figure 3b shows that the PL features of the QDs are similar
to the corresponding QD/Ag structure (Figure 1j). The QDs separated from the Ag film retained
the PL features from when they were on the Ag film. This means that
the QD PL changed permanently, even after the QDs were separated from
the QD/Ag hybrid. This confirms that the Ag+ dopants cause
the change of the PL and the doping can occur at room temperature
without extra heating. The PL properties depend on the chemical composition
of the QD/Ag hybrid rather than the physical properties of the Ag
film. The absorption spectra of the doped QDs is similar to that of
the nontreated QDs (Figure 3b), which means the introduction of Ag+ dopants
did not change the band edge levels but introduce the dopant trap
levels in the midgap. TRPL curves show that the enhanced TSE related
to Ag has a prolonged lifetime, which is consistent with the natural
characteristics of the dopant.10,11

The Ag/Cd ratio
of the doped QDs separated from the Ag film can
be measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS).
For these four QD batches stated above, the Ag/Cd ratios of the doped
QDs form the QD/Ag samples with and without annealing are listed below.
Two distinct features can be seen in Table 1. The first one is that the annealing increased
the Ag/Cd ratio of the doped QDs, which indicates that annealing can
improve the doping process in this QD/Ag system. The second feature
is that the QDs with the small size (410 nm CdS and 486 nm CdSe) have
a bigger Ag/Cd ratio than the large QDs (470 nm CdS and 560 nm CdSe).
The Ag/Cd ratio of the doped 470 nm CdSe without annealing is 0.77%,
which is bigger than that of the doped 560 nm CdSe QDs with annealing.
For the doped CdS QDs, the same is true.

the Ag Film

Another method to separate QD and Ag was inspired
by the original
way to obtain the monolayer graphite. For this method, the poly(methyl
methacrylate) (PMMA)-QD layer was coated on a transparent quartz plate
and then the Ag film was deposited on the PMMA-QD layer by thermal
evaporation. Compared to the QD layer, the PMMA-QD layer adhered well
to the quartz plate. In addition, the PMMA-QD layer is harder than
the QD layer. The Ag/PMMA-QD/quartz sample was then annealed at 150
°C for 30 min. Finally, part of the Ag film was removed using
scotch tape. It was found that the adhesion strength of the Ag film
coating to the PMMA layer was not good. Most part of the Ag film adhering
to the scotch tape can be easily peeled off and the PMMA-QD layer
still attached on the quartz plate. The final sample has three regions;
region I, PMMA-QD/quartz; region II, Ag/PMMA-QD/quartz; and region
III, PMMA-QD/quartz separated from the Ag film.

The PL was measured
from the back of the quartz substrate. PL features
of the PMMA-QD/quartz and Ag/PMMA-QD/quartz (560 nm CdSe) area are
similar to the QD/Si and QD/Ag hybrids, as stated above (Figure 2c). The PL spectrum
of PMMA-QD separated from the Ag film (region III) is similar to that
of region II. This further proves that the doping occurs in the PMMA-QD/Ag
hybrid. In Figure 3b, the photoluminescence excitation spectra (PLE) of the enhanced
TSE on region II and III have a similar shape except for around 320
nm. The peak at 540 nm of PLE spectra is related to the excitation
of the band edge. The PLE spectrum on region II has a pit at 320 nm,
whereas the PLE spectrum on region III does not have this pit. This
pit at 320 nm corresponds to the interband transition of
Ag bulk.20 Thus, the excitation light near
320 nm tends to penetrate the PMMA-QD/Ag structure while excitation
light at other wavelengths is reflected by the Ag film. This results
in the relative low excitation efficiency near the 320 nm.

This
method for local doping in the PMMA-QD film can create luminescence
patterns with a hollow mask (Figure 4d). The thick Ag film often cannot be peeled clean
(Top row of Figure 4d). This effect would influence the transparency of the sample. The
leakage of Ag vapor around the hollow area is hard to see in ambient
light, but after annealing, the limited amount of Ag can still dope
the PMMA-QD to form a red halo under UV light. We further evaporated
a very small amount of Ag (less than 1 nm) on the PMMA-QD film covered
with a hollow mask (second and third rows of Figure 4d). Under ambient light, the sample is as
transparent as the single PMMA-QD film. However, under UV light the
area deposited with Ag has a different luminescence color.

for detaching the QD and Ag film. (b) PL and PLE
spectra of the three regions of the PMMA-QD (560 nm CdSe QDs) sample.
(c) Decay PL curves correspond to the spectra in (b). (d) Depositing
Ag on the PMMA-QD film (560 nm CdSe QDs) with a hollow mask to prepare
the luminescence patterns. Before and after the annealing treatment,
the photographs were taken under ambient light and UV light, respectively.
Top, 60 nm Ag was deposited on the PMMA-QD film (560 nm CdSe QDs),
and the treatment is the same as that in (a). Middle and bottom, less
than 1 nm Ag was deposited on the PMMA-CdSe QD (560 nm CdSe QDs) and
PMMA-CdS QD (470 nm CdS QDs) film.

During the process of thermal evaporation, some Ag clusters can
enter into the shallow place of the PMMA-QDs layer. This increase
the contact between Ag and QDs. Some Ag+ ions at the interface
between the Ag and PMMA-QD layer can diffuse into the PMMA-QD layer
to dope the QDs. To dope the QDs embedded in PMMA, the diffusion of
Ag+ ions in the PMMA-QD layer is important. The thickness
of the PMMA-QD layer will influence the diffusion of Ag+ ions and the doping process.

PMMA-560 nm CdSe QD layers with
four thicknesses were coated on
the 60 nm Ag substrate. The thicknesses of the three thinner PMMA-QD
layers were 93.8, 131.3, and 187.5 nm, respectively. The thickest
PMMA-QD layer was prepared by dropping the PMMA-QD dispersion on the
substrate. The thickest PMMA-QD layer was too rough to measure its
thickness by an ellipsometer. Then these four samples were annealed
at 150 °C for 30 min. The PL spectra of these annealed PMMA-QD/Ag
samples are displayed in Figure 5a. For the three thinner samples, the dopant PL area
of the PMMA-QD layer increases with the increase of the thickness.
The decay curves in Figure 5b show that the relatively strong dopant PL corresponds to
a longer lifetime. This indicated that increasing the thickness of
the PMMA-QD layer within a certain range can optimize the doping process.
The thickest PMMA-QD layer/Ag sample had the weakest dopant PL, which
indicated that it is difficult for Ag+ ions to diffuse
far enough to reach the surface of the thick PMMA-QD layer. Our previous
studies indicated that the oleic acid (OA) in the QD (or PMMA-QD)
layer can etch the Ag film to fabricate Ag+ ions for doping
the QDs.17 PMMA-QD layer, in this case,
plays dual roles of the dopant receptor and the etchant to Ag. The
thinner PMMA-QD layer facilitates the diffusion of Ag+ ions,
but the thicker PMMA-QD layer with more amount of QDs can etch the
Ag film to create adequate Ag+ ions. These two competitive
mechanisms show that the PMMA-QD layer with a moderate thickness has
an optimized doping effect. The gradient of Ag+ ions along
the thickness direction results in the gradual doping along the thickness
direction. This causes that the 187.5 nm PMMA-QD layer has a red-shifted
and broader dopant PL than the 131.3 nm PMMA-QD layer. Here, a sample
with the PMMA-QD/PMMA/Ag structure was prepared by successively coating
a PMMA (∼80 nm) and a PMMA-QD layer (∼200 nm) on the
60 nm Ag substrate. The PMMA layer was inserted between the Ag film
and PMMA-QD layer for isolating the PMMA-QD and Ag film. This mid
PMMA layer can not only inhibit the etching of the Ag film by residual
OA in the PMMA-QD layer but also may hinder the diffusion of Ag+ ions toward the PMMA-QD layer. In line with expectations,
the annealed PMMA-QD/PMMA/Ag sample has a weak dopant PL. Another
PMMA-QD/PMMA/Ag sample with OA-doped PMMA mid layer was prepared for
comparison. Figure 5c shows that the annealed PMMA-QD/PMMA-OA/Ag sample has a distinct
dopant PL, which indicates that the OA in the mid layer can etch the
Ag film to produce Ag+ ions and these Ag+ ions
can cross the mid layer to doping the QDs in the annealing process.

Ag+ ions in the PMMA-QD/PMMA/Ag and PMMA-QD/PMMA-OA/Ag

The Role of Annealing and the Mechanism of Ag Doping
For
the QD/Ag hybrid, in this case, annealing plays an interesting
role to change the dopant PL characteristics. The features of dopant
PL mainly depend on the concentration and position of the dopants.10−14,21−24 Annealing may create more Ag+ in the environment, improve the diffusion of Ag+ dopants to QD, and restructure the QD surface. Some PL features
of the QD/hybrid such as the size effect and the blue shift of TSE
can be explained with the Ag-doping process.

The small QD on
the Ag film show enhanced PL while annealing favors the enhancement
of QDs with a bigger size. Previous studies proposed that the Ag+ can penetrate into the interstitial positions,13,21 substitute the surface Cd atoms,10,22,23 or attach to the Se atom.24 The substitutional Ag+ ions were considered to be the
origin of the dopant PL.10 The Cd/Se and
Cd/S ratios of the QDs stated above were semiqualitatively measured
by energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) (Table 2). The
smaller QDs have a larger Cd/chalcogenide ratio, which benefits the
exchange between Ag+ and Cd2+.25 Additionally, the high surface to volume ratio makes the
small QD sensitive to surface doping. The surface of small QDs tends
to absorb enough dopants at room temperature, thereby the QD/Ag hybrids
have an evident TSE peak (Figure 1a,g). The QD surface may adsorb excess dopants beyond
the optimal concentration in the annealing process. This introduces
extra defect states that act as nonradiative centers. Therefore, the
annealed QD/Ag, including small QDs, has decreased TSE with a shorter
lifetime. As the energy transfer from the band edge to trap defect
increases, the BEE lifetime of the annealed QD/Ag decreases (Figure 1b,h).

Table 2 Cd/Se and Cd/S Ratio of the Above
QD Batches Measured by EDS and XPS
QD batch	Cd/chalcogenide (EDS)	Cd/chalcogenide (XPS)	
412 nm CdS	1.57	1.42	
470 nm CdS	1.34	1.03	
486 nm CdSe	1.23	1.63	
560 nm CdSe	1.00	0.91	
For the large QDs on the Ag film, the surface doping
can occur
at room temperature such that the QD/Ag has enhanced TSE compared
with the bare QD (Figures 1–3). Annealing improves doping
with Ag+ ions to achieve the optimal amount and position
of Ag+ ions in the QD. Therefore, the annealed QD/Ag has
increased TSE. This explains the size-dependent enhancement of TSE
in Figure 1.

The proper or excess dopants will result in the enhancement or
quenching of PL. Moreover, the OA in the QD layer can etch the Ag
film and provide an adequate quantity of Ag+ ions surrounding
the QDs.17 In Figure 2, the same QD layer is deposited on Ag films
with varied morphology, thus inducing varying amounts of Ag+ ions. This results in the different initial PL characters. Annealing
promptly optimizes the concentration and position of Ag+ dopants that result in uniform PL characters (Figure 2). We also found that depositing the ZnS
shell on the core QDs (such as the CdZnS and CdSe QDs) can block the
exchange between Ag+ and Cd2+ ions. For the
QD/Ag hybrid with CdZnS/ZnS or CdSe/ZnS QDs, almost no significant
enhancement of the TSE was observed (Supporting Information, Figure S5).15

Previous literature indicates that the increasing dopant concentration
results in the red shift of the dopant PL.14,22 In our experience, the TSE peak of the annealed QD/Ag hybrid usually
have shorter wavelengths than those of the unannealed one (Figure 1).15−17 In the coordinate
system with energy as the horizontal axis, the PL spectrum of the
QD/Ag hybrid can be well fitted with two Gaussian bands including
the BEE and TSE (showed in Figure 6). The as-prepared 470 nm CdS/Ag hybrid has the TSE
at 2.03 eV. Aging can improve doping. Thirteen months later, this
CdS/Ag hybrid shows enhanced TSE at 2.03 eV. The annealed 470 nm CdS/Ag
hybrid has a TSE at 2.07 eV with a blue shift of 0.04 eV. The TSE
of the as-prepared 560 nm CdSe/Ag hybrid is located at 1.91 eV, whereas
the TSEs of the 4 months aged and annealed CdSe/Ag hybrid are located
at 1.95 and 1.94 eV, respectively.

and 560 nm CdSe/Ag (b)
hybrids. (c) Mechanism schematic for explaining the size-dependent
enhancement and the blue shift of TSE in the annealing process.

Annealing or aging treatments may improve the diffusion
of Ag+ ions in QD. The surface Ag+ dopants may
move toward
the interior by lattice diffusion during the annealing course. This
interior doping may result in the blue shift of the dopant TSE because
the interior ligand field is different from that on the surface.26,27 The Ag+ dopant in CdSe QD has been considered as the
hole trap state for the carriers.14,28 A hypothetical
model in Figure 6c
is proposed to explain the phenomenon stated above. In our case, surface
doping can occur at room temperature (Figures 1–3). Annealing
tends to transfer the surface dopants to the interior of the QD. In
the annealing or aging process, some Ag+ ions diffuse inside
the QD such that the interior dopant levels become shallow due to
the change of the ligand field around the dopants. The surface doping
also occurs in the annealing or aging process. The dominant interior
doping will cause the blue shift of TSE. Otherwise, if the dopants
gather on the QD surface, the energy levels of dopants become tight.
This can induce the carriers to relax to the deeper levels and therefore
causes the PL peak to shift to the longer wavelength. For supporting
this statement, two QD/Ag hybrid samples (470 nm CdS and 560 nm CdSe
QDs) were annealed in a vacuum for comparison. In Figure 6a,b, it can be seen that annealing
the CdS/Ag and CdSe/Ag hybrids in a vacuum causes the evident red
shift of TSE (1.97 and 1.79 eV). The ligands on the QD surface will
escape when the QDs are heated in a vacuum. The QD surface lacking
protection tends to attach Ag+ dopants, resulting in dominant
surface doping. This results in the evident red shift of the TSE peak.

The model stated above indicates that annealing can not only improve
the doping process (cation exchange) on the QD surface but also transfer
the surface dopants to the interior of the QDs. For further supporting
this conjecture, we intentionally prepared the Ag-doped 470 nm CdS
QDs (surface-doped Ag:CdS QDs) with an easy wet method (Experimental Section) and observed the change of the dopant
PL after the annealing treatment (150 °C, 30 min). Figure 7 shows the PL spectra of the
470 nm  Ag:CdS QDs on the Si substrate with and without
annealing treatment. Compared with the undoped 470 nm CdS QDs, the
as-prepared Ag:CdS QDs have a dopant PL peak located at 616 nm. With
annealing treatment, the dopant PL peak of the Ag:CdS QDs became
stronger slightly and shifted to 602 nm (Figure 7a). The dopant PL lifetime of the annealed
Ag:CdS QD/Si structure (34.5 ns) is shorter than that of the
unannealed one (40.2 ns). Figure 7c shows that coating the Ag:CdS QDs on the Ag
film will further dope the Ag:CdS QDs due to the  increased dopant
PL and Ag/Cd ratio . Annealing the Ag:CdS QD/Ag hybrid
can further enhance the dopant PL and cause the blue shift of dopant
PL (602 nm). The dopant PL lifetime of the annealed Ag:CdS QD/Ag
structure (43.9 ns) is shorter than that of the unannealed one (48.3
ns). For the case in Figure 7a, the dopant concentration will not increase during
the annealing process because the external source of Ag+ ions is not taken into account (Figure 7e shows that the Ag/Cd ratio decreased after
the annealing). Therefore, the diffusion of the Ag+ dopants
in QDs should be the main cause of the blue shift (616–602
nm) of the dopant PL. Ag+ dopants may diffuse to the interior
or exterior of the QDs in the annealing process (Figure 7e). If inward diffusion is
not considered, the outward diffusion of Ag+ ions will
decrease the dopant concentration that will cause the decrease in
dopant PL (Figure 7c shows that increasing the dopants in the Ag:CdS QDs causes
the enhancement of dopant PL and vice versa). In summary, the inward
diffusion of Ag+ dopants caused the blue shift of the dopant
PL. The interior doping benefits the enhancement of dopant PL (Figure 7a,c) that corresponds
to the bigger radiative recombination rate and the decreased PL lifetime
(Figure 7b,d). In contrast,
the surface doping will cause the red shift of the dopant PL. The
wet method for doping at room temperature (Supporting Information, Figure S4) may mainly cause the surface doping.

of Ag+ dopants during the annealing process. The Ag/Cd
ratio (measured by ICP-MS) of the QDs mentioned in (a) and (c) are
demostrated in the corresponding cartoons.

For the undoped QD/Ag hybrid, the surface and interior doping may
coexist during the annealing process, thereby the competition mechanism
between the surface and interior doping will influence the PL characters.

Conclusions
For the solid QD/Ag hybrid with enhanced TSE,
the QD component
was separated from Ag but the enhanced TSE remained. We conclude that
the Ag-enhanced TSE of CdSe and CdS QDs is ascribed to the doping
process. This proves a way to identify whether other selective enhancements
of PL come from the plasmonic resonance.

The residual OA in
the QD layer can etch the Ag film to produce
appreciable Ag+ ions around the QDs. The high ratio of
the surface area to the bulk renders the small CdSe and CdS QDs sensitive
to the surface doping. Meanwhile, the Cd-rich surface of the small
QD benefits the cation exchange between Ag+ and Cd2+ ions. These two factors result in the unannealed small QD/Ag
hybrid to exhibit a dominant TSE. In the annealing process, the excess
Ag+ ions dope the small QDs to produce extra defects as
nonradiative centers, which quench the PL.

The dopant PL can
be modified by tuning the concentration and position
of the dopants. Annealing the QD/Ag hybrid in air at the proper temperature
can improve the diffusion of the surface Ag+ dopant into
the QD, consequently modifying the ligand field around the dopants.
The interior doping can cause the dopant level to shift shallower,
resulting in a blue shift of the TSE. Conversely, annealing the hybrid
in a vacuum can cause the surface doping to be dominant, thereby causing
a red shift of the TSE. The above-stated methods provide an effective
way to dope the solid CdSe and CdS QD film (or QD-PMMA hybrid) at
a designed area. The traditional method for postsynthetic Ag+ doping employs the Ag source in the liquid phase,13,21−24 thereby the doping course will introduce unexpected organic impurities
into the surroundings of the reaction. The dry method presented herein
differs from the typical wet method in that it uses pure solid silver
as the Ag source. This dry doping method can further dope the doped
QDs such as Ag:CdS  QDs to modify the PL properties.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
Selenium powder (Se, 99.999%), cadmium oxide
(CdO, 99.95%), 1-octadecane (ODE, 90%), oleic acid (OA, 90%), tri-n-octyl phosphine (TOP, 90%), and poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA, average MW 350 000) were purchased from Alfa Aesar.
Tributylphosphine (TBP, 95%), sulfur powder (99.99%), and oleylamine
(80–90%) were purchased form Aladdin-reagent. Solvents such
as toluene, ethanol, and acetone were used as received.

Preparation
of CdS and CdSe QDs
For CdS QDs with an
emission peak at 412 nm, 2 mmol CdO powder, 3 mL OA, and 30 mL ODE
were loaded in a three-necked flask. The flask was heated to 300 °C
under an argon atmosphere until a transparent Cd precursor was formed.
The heat was then removed and 1 mL TBPS solution (S powder dissolved
in TBP with 3 M concentration) was injected into the flask, after
which the flask was cooled immediately. For 486 nm CdSe QDs, the Cd
precursor was prepared as above, and 2 mL TOPSe (selenium dissolved
in TOP with 2 M concentration) was injected into the flask at 170
°C, after which the flask was cooled immediately. The QD product
was precipitated through centrifugation. The precipitate was dispersed
in toluene. The wavelength of the QDs can be tuned by mainly varying
the injection temperature and the reaction time. The details were
stated in previous papers.15−17

Preparation of the QD/Ag
Hybrid Sample
The method was
described in our previous papers.15−17 Briefly, the clean Si
wafer was cut into square pieces. Half of the polished Si surface
was coated with a 60 nm Ag film by thermal evaporation. The QDs dispersed
in toluene were coated on the Si wafer with a spin coater. Then the
sample was cut into two pieces along the direction perpendicular to
the boundary between the areas with Ag and without Ag. One piece was
kept as a reference sample and the other one was annealed in air at
150 °C for 30 min.

Preparation of the PMMA-QD Film
The PMMA powders were
added to the QD dispersion with a 3% weight concentration. The PMMA-QDs/toluene
blend was placed until the PMMA powders were dissolved completely.
The blend can be coated on the Si wafer or quartz glass to form the
PMMA-QD film. For preparing the PMMA-QD/PMMA/Ag sample, the PMMA dissolved
in toluene (3% weight concentration) was first coated on the 60 nm
Ag film, and then the PMMA-QD blend was coated on the dried PMMA layer.
For preparing the PMMA-QD/PMMA/Ag sample with the OA-doped PMMA mid
layer, the OA-doped PMMA solution (0.3 mL OA was added into 9 mL PMMA
solution) was coated on the Ag film first and the PMMA-QD blend was
coated again.

Preparation of the  Ag:CdS QDs
with Wet Method
AgNO3 (6 mmol) was dissolved in
a mixture of 24 mL toluene
and 6 mL oleylamine, and then the mixture was diluted with toluene
to reach the Ag concentration of 10–2 M. With the
help of ICP-MS, the 470 nm CdS QDs were dispersed in toluene with
the Cd concentration of 4 × 10–2 M.

The
Ag-doped CdS QD dispersion was prepared by mixing the Ag precursor
and 470 nm CdS QD dispersion with the Ag/Cd ratio of 1:50. Then, the
doped QDs were precipitated through centrifugation. The precipitate
was dispersed in toluene.

Measurement and Equipment
PL spectra
were measured
using an Edinburgh FLS920 PL system. The steady PL spectra were measured
with the excitation of a 325 nm line of a Xe lamp. Time-resolved PL
(TRPL) was measured using a 374 nm picosecond laser. The absorption
spectra were measured by an AvaSpec-ULS2048 spectrometer. SEM images
were scanned by a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope. For
measuring the Ag/Cd ratio of the doped QDs, the QD/Ag samples with
and without annealing were soaked in toluene to dissolve the QD layer.
The isolated QD dispersion was filtered first and then dried in a
vacuum. The precipitation was cleaned by ethanol and then dissolved
with HNO3 for the ICP-MS test. The thickness of PMMA-QD
layers was measured by the SE-100A ellipsometer.
