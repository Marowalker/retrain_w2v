The selective interaction of signaling
compounds including neurotransmitters
and drugs with the dopamine receptors (DARs) is extremely important
for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we report a
method to probe the selective interactions of signaling compounds
with D1 and D2 DARs in living cells using the combined approach of
theoretical calculation and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).
When signaling compounds such as DA, amphetamine, methamphetamine,
and methylenedioxypyrovalerone interact with D1 dopamine receptors
(DRD1), the intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) level
is increased. However, the intracellular level of cAMP is decreased
when D2 dopamine receptors (DRD2) interact with the abovementioned
signaling compounds. In our experiments, we have internalized the
silica-coated silver nanoparticles (AgNP@SiO2) in living
cells to adsorb biologically generated cAMP which was probed by using
SERS. Besides adsorptions of cAMP, AgNP@SiO2 has a crucial
role for the enhancement of Raman cross section of the samples. We
observed the characteristic SERS peaks of cAMP when DRD1-overexpressed
cells interact with the signaling compounds; these peaks were not
observed for other cells including DRD2-overexpressed and DRD1–DRD2-coexpressed
cells. Our experimental approach is successful to probe the intracellular
cAMP and characterize the selectivity of signaling compounds to different
types of DARs. Furthermore, our experimental approach is highly capable
for in vivo studies because it can probe intracellular cAMP using
a low input power of incident laser without significant cell damage.
Our experimental results and density functional theory calculations
showed that 780 and 1503 cm–1 are signature Raman
peaks of cAMP. The SERS peak at 780 cm–1 is associated
with C–O, C–C, and C–N stretching and symmetric
and asymmetric bending of two O–H bonds of cAMP, whereas the
SERS peak at 1503 cm–1 is contributed by the O9–H3 bending mode.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) is the largest superfamily
of membrane proteins, which comprises more than 800 protein-coding
human genes.1 It is a heptahelical transmembrane
protein, which controls and regulates many activities including vision,
test, smell, thinking, and behaviors. It is activated by a huge range
of stimuli such as hormones, pheromones, light, peptides, odorants,
and neurotransmitters.2 Dopamine receptors
(DARs) are a type of GPCRs, which are primarily activated by dopamine
(DA) and produce dopaminergic signals in mammalian brains (Figure 1). Mainly, five types
of human DARs are reported in the literature: D1, D2, D3, D4, and
D5 DARs, which are classified into two classes: (1) the D1-like DARs
comprise D1 and D5 DARs and (2) the D2-like DARs comprise D2, D3,
and D4 DARs. This classification is based on the sequence homology
and functions of DARs. Although a high degree of similarity is found
between DARs of similar classes, each type of DAR is encoded with
different genes. For example, the D1 DAR is encoded by DRD1 genes
and D5 DAR is encoded by DRD5 genes.3−6 Many DARs are expressed heterogeneously
in cells, and it is very difficult to target selectively to a specific
type of DARs. Nevertheless, in vivo characterization of DARs and their
selective interaction with signaling compounds have great pharmaceutical
importance to understand the synaptic and neural circuit action produced
by DA and other signaling compounds.

Figure 1 (A) Homology model of D1 DARs and (B)
structure of D2 DAR bound
to the atypical antipsychotic drug risperidone (PDB ID 6CM4).

DARs have several roles in the central nervous
system of a human
body, such as cognition, motivation, memory, motor control, and modulation
of neuroendocrine activities. The termination of the G protein signaling
and the initiation of the G protein-independent signaling are also
regulated by DARs.7−9 The D1-like DARs are also known to interact with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and gamma-aminobutyric
acid (GABA) receptors via their intercellular loops and C-termini.10−12 D1-like DARs couple with the Gs/olf subunit of the heterotrimeric
G protein, which stimulates the synthesis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cAMP) in cells,13 whereas D2-like receptors couple with the Gi/o/z
subunit of the G protein and inhibit the synthesis of cAMP.14 cAMP is an important secondary messenger, which
has several roles including the regulation of downstream proteins,15 ion channels,16−19 and transcription factors.20−22 cAMP is synthesized from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by the action
of adenylate cyclase. cAMP could be converted back into ATP by the
catalytic action of phosphodiesterase.23−26 cAMP has regulating roles in
several biochemical processes such as metabolism of glycogens and
lipids.27 Besides, it also activates the
calcium channel for the release of growth hormones.28−30 Because a change
of the cAMP concentration in a live cell is connected to the interaction
of DARs, we have utilized cAMP as a key compound in this study.

The biochemical functions of DARs only occur after their interactions
with signaling molecules or any other stimuli. Therefore, the probing
of interactions between signaling molecules such as DA, amphetamine
(AMP), methamphetamine (MAMP), and methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV)
and DARs has high medical impacts. Both D1 and D2 DARs have a crucial
role as targets for antipsychotic drugs. Most of the clinically approved
drugs still show poor selectivity between different types of DARs.
Highly specific drugs are extremely important to cure the neuropsychiatric
and endocrine disorders because the poor selectivity of a drug has
severe side effects. Wide numbers of experimental and computational
approaches including ligand binding assay,31−36 positron emission tomography (PET),37 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT),38 and high-throughput screening39 are used for the pharmacological and chemical characterizations
of signaling molecules (drugs) and their selectivity to a specific
DAR.40−60 Fluorescence microscopy is one of the important techniques for the
imaging of biological samples, but this technique suffers from some
limitations, including the photobleaching effect, phototoxicity in
living cells due to shorter wavelength of light, and cytotoxicity
due to byproduct formation in situ photochemical reactions.61−66 Some literature has also reported the changes in the biological
property of the sample after fluorescence labeling.67,68 Similarly, the radio ligand binding assay69 produces toxic radioactive wastes which are extremely harmful to
in vivo studies. Although the above-mentioned techniques are useful
to screen the binding specificity of signaling molecules such as drugs
and neurotransmitters, they suffer from some serious limitations.
For example, analytical results obtained from the above-mentioned
techniques are based on the observation of a ligand–receptor
complex rather than a product formation scheme. Therefore, the results
from the above-mentioned experimental techniques have a complexity
to explain precisely about the effective interactions between signaling
molecules and proteins. Therefore, it is highly desirable and necessary
to use a product-based technique to probe the ligand–protein
interactions. Here, we report our application of surface-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy (SERS) techniques to study the interaction between
DARs and signaling molecules such as DA, AMP, MAMP, and MDPV in live
cells.

Raman spectroscopy, one of the sensitive and selective
chemical
identification and analytical approach, was introduced to study the
biological sample from the analysis of bacteriorhodopsin, which was
later extended to study the salmon sperm and other living cells.70−72 Different forms of Raman spectroscopy are established as a powerful
analytical approach for the label-free characterization of diverse
biological molecules including heme protein, membrane protein, protein
coenzymes, porphyrins, and highly organized systems such as photosynthetic
reaction centers and membrane preparation bacteria.73−80 The enhancement of Raman cross section in the SERS technique is
achieved by exploiting the electromagnetic and chemical enhancement
mechanisms using a metallic substrate, especially a rough surface,
or nanoparticles (NPs) of gold or silver.81 The metal NP used in Raman experiments also has another advantage
such as the quenching of the fluorescence background.82−84 The combined approach of SERS and other techniques including fluorescence
microscopy and electrophysiology is widely used to investigate the
huge range of biological samples.85−94 Although the SERS technique has a wide range of useful applications,
there are some limitations. For example, the SERS substrate denatures
proteins during the experiment, which is due to the direct interaction
of the Ag+ ion or metal with the sulfhydryl group of the
protein.95,96 The direct interaction of the metal NP with
the cells also causes cytotoxic problems.97,98 The prevention of direct interactions between the metallic surface
and biological molecules is highly desirable and recommended to protect
biological samples during the SERS experiment, which was achieved
in our experiment by generating an ultrathin layer (4–6 nm)
of silica over silver NPs (AgNPs).77,80,99,100 It is known that these
NPs are capable of preventing the denaturation of proteins and cytotoxicity
in cells without reducing the electromagnetic field enhancement.98,99

In this study, the SERS spectra from DRD1, DRD2, and DRD1–DRD2-co-overexpressed
cells and baseline cells in the absence and presence of signaling
compounds including DA, AMP, MAMP, and MDPV were analyzed to test
the effective and selective interaction of these compounds with DARs.
When signaling molecules such as DA, AMP, MAMP, and MDPV were added
to DRD1-expressed cells, the characteristic SERS peaks of cAMP were
observed, which helped us to confirm the effective interaction between
DRD1 and these signaling compounds. However, the interaction between
signaling compounds and DRD2 was comparatively difficult to probe
because this interaction is related to depletion of the cAMP level
in cells, which does not give off any new SERS peaks. Therefore, experiments
in DRD1–DRD2-co-overexpressed cells were required to test the
selective interaction of a signaling compound with DRD2 receptors.
The DRD1–DRD2-coexpressed cells did not show the SERS peaks
of cAMP in the presence of signaling compounds, which indicated two
possibilities: (1) signaling compounds were either selective to DRD2
receptors only or (2) they were equally selective to both DRD1 and
DRD2 receptors and the resultant effect to produce cAMP was canceled.
The first possibility was ruled out because all four signaling compounds
had interacted with the DRD1 receptor and induced the cAMP level in
the cells. The analysis of our results showed that all four signaling
compounds are equally selective to both DRD1 and DRD2 receptors. Our
experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations
show that 780 and 1503 cm–1 are signature Raman
peaks of intracellular cAMP. The visualization of the calculated molecular
vibration shows that the SERS peak at 780 cm–1 is
associated with C–O, C–C, and C–N stretching
and symmetric and asymmetric bending of two O–H bonds of cAMP,
whereas the SERS peak at 1503 cm–1 is contributed
by its O9–H3 bending mode.

2 Materials and Experimental Section
2.1 Overexpression
of DRD1 and DRD2 in Cells
HEK293 and HT22 cells were cultured
in 75 cm2 flasks
in a complete medium which was obtained by mixing Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma-Aldrich D5796) with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, F2442) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin
(ATCC, 30–2300) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere.101 When the cells reached ∼75% confluence,
they were ready for the subculture. For the SERS measurement, the
cells were subcultured on a 25 mm circular cover glass in a 35 mm
Petri dish. When the cells reached 50% confluence on the cover glass,
they were transfected with the plasmid for the overexpression of DARs.
We used tango-DRD1 (66268) and GFP-DRD2 (24099)-encoded plasmid DNA,
respectively, for the expression of D1 and D2 DARs. We purchased these
plasmids from Addgene as the bacteria in the agar stab. The plasmids
were amplified according to the standard protocol. Briefly, the bacteria
from the agar stab were separately streaked on the surface of an LB
agar plate using a sterile wire loop. Each LB plate was kept inside
a small incubator for 16 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were grown on the
LB plate as colonies with a copy of plasmids. Then, a single bacterial
colony was separated and transferred into a falcon round-bottom tube
containing 6 mL of LB solution with 100 μg/mL ampicillin. The
falcon tube was placed in a rotating incubator for 24 h at 37 °C
to grow bacteria. Then, the bacteria were extracted from the LB solution
in a 2 mL centrifuge tube in the form of a solid residue by the centrifuge
process. This residue was dissolved with the resuspension reagent
(Thermo Scientific, GeneJET Plasmid Miniprep kit, cat. no. K0502)
and added with the lysis and neutralization solution to separate cell
membranes and plasmids from the bacteria. The resulting solution was
centrifuged for 15 min at 1200 rpm, and the supernatant solution was
filtered through a miniprep or gene jet spin column to remove the
filtrate. The content adsorbed on the filter was washed with the wash
buffer to remove any adsorbed alcohol. Finally, the filter was washed
twice with 25 μL of elution buffer to collect a total 50 μL
of 1 mg/mL plasmid DNA solution. For efficient gene transfer by transfection,
we followed a protocol of lipid-mediated transfection with Lipofectamine
LTX and PLUS reagent (Invitrogen, 11668-019). The day before transfection,
the antibiotic-containing growth medium was replaced with the growth
medium without antibiotics (penicillin–streptomycin). The preparation
of the DNA reagent that was required to be added into the cell samples
is explained briefly as follows: 50 μL of Opti-MEM-reduced serum
medium was taken in a 2 mL centrifuge tube and added to 4 μL
of Lipofectamine LTX solution; however, the amount of Lipofectamine
LTX could be varied. The mixture was vortexed and labeled as (1).
Then, 250 μL of Opti-MEM medium and 5 μL of plasmid DNA
were taken in a 2 mL centrifuge tube and added to 5 μL of PLUS
reagent, which was labeled as (2). Then, 50 μL of solution (2)
was mixed with solution (1), and this mixed solution was kept at room
temperature for 5 min for incubation. After incubation, 50 μL
of this mixed solution was added into the cells. The transfection
of cells with DRD1 and DRD2 was confirmed by the observation of tango
and green fluorescence, respectively.

2.2 Synthesis
of Silica-Coated AgNPs
AgNPs were synthesized by a standard
sodium citrate reduction method,102 followed
by the addition of active sodium silicate
to generate ultrathin silica shells over AgNPs.103 Silver nitrate (AgNO3), sodium citrate, and
sodium silicate required for the synthesis of NPs were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. The AgNPs and
AgNP@SiO2 were characterized by transmission electron microscopy
and a Varian UV–vis spectrophotometer (EL07013173), respectively.
The size of AgNP@SiO2 particles was found to be 80 ±
10 nm with the SiO2 shell thickness 5 ± 1 nm (Figure S1). The UV–vis measurement shows
the maxima (λmax) of the plasmon resonance band position
of the AgNP colloid at 420 nm, which was shifted to 407 nm for AgNP@SiO2.77

2.3 Surface-Enhanced
Raman Measurements
SERS spectra were collected using a home-modified
confocal Raman
microscope104 (Figure S2) using a 488 nm continuous-wave (CW) argon-ion laser of
approximately 10 ± 5 μW power. We used 30 s integration
time for the recording of a SERS spectrum. Mercury lamp and cyclohexane
were used to calibrate the setup before Raman measurements with a
spectral resolution of 2 cm–1. For the analysis
of conventional SERS spectrum, we selected the range of 700–1700
cm–1. We maintained the same experimental parameters
throughout the experiment to avoid their effect. For the collection
of conventional SERS spectra, a long pass filter (HHQ495LP) was positioned
in front of the entrance slit of a monochromator (Triax 550, Jobin
Yvon). The Raman spectra were collected by a LN2-CCD (Princeton Instruments)
which was cooled at about −100 °C.

2.4 DFT Calculations
The geometry optimization
and Raman frequency calculations of the signaling compounds and cAMP
were performed using the DFT method on B3LYP/6-31G(d) and B3PW91/LANL2DZ
levels and Gaussian 09 package. The obtained frequencies from B3LYP/6-31G(d)
level calculations were scaled by a factor of 0.9614,105 whereas the frequencies obtained from B3PW91/LANL2DZ
levels were used without applying any scaling factor (Figure S3). The DFT Raman spectra of the signaling
compounds are provided in Figure S4. All
calculations were carried out on a vector processor (Ohio Supercomputer
Center, Columbus, Ohio).

3 Results and Discussion
Raman spectroscopic probing of interactions between signaling compounds
and DARs relies on effective experimental procedures including successful
internalization of AgNP@SiO2 and probing of intracellular
cAMP in living cells. We discuss the important experimental procedure
under the following subtopics.

3.1 Internalization of Metal
NPs (AgNP@SiO2)
We studied the interaction of
signaling compounds
with D1 and D2 DARs using the combined approach of the SERS measurement,
optical microscopy, and DFT calculations. We added finely dispersed
AgNP@SiO2 on cells, which passes through the semipermeable
membrane to the cytoplasm. For the fine dispersion of NPs, the AgNP@SiO2 colloids were vortexed for 15 min before addition to cell
samples. The differential interference contrast (DIC) imaging analysis
was utilized to test the internalization of AgNP@SiO2 in
the cells (Figure 2). We assumed that the internalized NP is in the same plane as the
outsider NPs on a cover glass. The outsider NPs on the top of the
cell membrane were observed clearly at the up-focusing mode of the
objective lens (Figure 2A). In this mode, both outsider NPs on the cover glass and internalized
NPs were feeble. However, both outsider NPs on the cover glass and
internalized NPs were darker when the objective of microscope was
in the down-focusing mode (Figure 2C). Our NPs took longer time (∼18 h) for internalization
in cells because these NPs were not specifically modified to target
the cytoplasm. This incubation time could be decreased significantly
by tethering cytoplasm-targeting ligands on the NPs.106 We observed few events of cluster formation of well-dispersed
NPs after internalization, which is important for the enhancement
of Raman intensity.

0.2 μM concentration. The internalized AgNP@SiO2 in
cells is confirmed by changing the focusing modes of the microscope:
(A) up-focus, (B) focus, (C) down-focus, and (D) further down-focus
conditions. On the basis of the DIC image, we assumed that internalized
NPs are in the same plane as outsider NPs on a cover glass. The Raman
image related to cAMP (780 cm–1) due to interaction
of DRD1 with DA is collected using a 488 nm CW excitation laser of
10–15 μW power and a band-pass filter of 508.5 ±
2 nm by a CMOS industrial charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (RS-500C).
The image in (E) is obtained using weak white light and a CW laser,
whereas the image in (F) is obtained using a CW laser only.

3.2 Probing
of Intracellular cAMP in HEK293 Cells
After internalization
of AgNP@SiO2 in four types of
cells: baseline HEK293 cells, DRD1-expressed HEK293 cells, DRD2-expressed
HEK293 cells, and DRD1–DRD2-coexpressed HEK293 cells, the SERS
spectra from these cells were collected under two different conditions.
Condition 1 corresponds to the presence of signaling compounds such
as DA, AMP, MAMP, and MDPV, and condition 2 corresponds to the absence
of signaling compounds. For condition 1, the signaling compound was
added 2 h after the addition of AgNP@SiO2. We found that
when DRD1-overexpressed cells interacted with a signaling compound,
the intracellular level of the cAMP level was induced, which was confirmed
by the observation of cAMP-related signature peaks at 780 and 1503
cm–1. We used five Petri dishes of DA-DRD1 cells
to test the cAMP-related SERS peaks and found that 4–5 cells
out of 20 randomly selected cells from a Petri dish showed cAMP-related
SERS peaks, and out of 100 cells from five Petri dishes, 22% cells
showed cAMP-related peaks. In similar experiments in 100 DA-DRD2 cells,
0% cells showed cAMP-related peaks. In addition, we also collected
the mode-selective SERS image of 780 cm–1 using
a 508.5 ± 2 nm band-pass filter and a CMOS industrial CCD camera
(RS-500C). In this experiment, out of 20 randomly selected DA-DRD1
cells from a Petri dish, 5–8 cells showed the Raman image related
to 780 cm–1, and out of 100 DA-DRD1 cells from five
Petri dishes, 37% cells showed the Raman image related to 780 cm–1. For similar experiments in 100 DA-DRD2 cells, 7%
of them showed the Raman image related to 780 cm–1. Minor discrepancies are found between the occurrence of Raman peaks
and the Raman image, which is due to the wide range of the band-pass
filter. The spectral range of the band-pass filter (508.5 ± 2
nm) is particularly higher to collect the mode-selective Raman image
related to 780 cm–1, that is why the mode-selective
Raman image could be contributed by other Raman wavenumbers too. Similarly,
2% cells out of 100 DRD1-DRD2-coexpressed cells showed the cAMP-related
SERS peaks, whereas 9% of them showed the mode-selective Raman image
related to 780 cm–1. The statistics of cAMP-related
peaks and images are summarized in Figure 3. The imperceptible amount of cAMP due to
the interaction of DA with DRD1–DRD2-co-overexpressed cells
is due to the competitive action of DRD1 and DRD2 receptors for the
synthesis and depletion of cAMP, respectively. We assumed that the
competitive action for the synthesis and depletion of cAMP in cells
is favored by the nonselective affinity of the four signaling compounds
toward DRD1 and DRD2 receptors. Intracellular cAMP molecules formed
during interactions of DRD1 with the signaling compounds are trapped
by internalized AgNP@SiO2 and probed using SERS, where
the formation of cAMP was confirmed by the appearance of its signature
SERS peaks at 780 and 1503 cm–1. The Raman assignment
of these signature peaks of cAMP is provided elsewhere in this article.

Figure 3 Percentage
occurrence of cAMP-marker (780 cm–1) SERS peaks
and SERS images observed from DA-added DRD1, DRD2, and
DRD1–DRD2-expressed HEK 293 cells (out of 100 cells of each
type). The spectral range of the band-pass filter (508.5 ± 2
nm) is huge to collect the mode-selective Raman image, that is why
% occurrence of the mode-selective image is greater than the % occurrence
of the Raman peak.

We consider that SERS
peaks at 780 and 1503 cm–1 are signatures of cAMP
because these peaks were only observed in
DRD1-expressed HEK293 cells in the presence of signaling compounds
(Figures 4A–D
and 5A) and pure cAMP compounds (Figure 4E). Our controlled experiment
showed that these SERS peaks were not observed in the pure form of
all four signaling compounds (Figures 4F–I and S4) and cells
(Figures 4J, S5–S8, and S9E,F). Moreover, these SERS
peaks were not observed for the interaction between signaling compounds
and other cells except DRD1-expressed cells (Figure 5). Our experimental results showed that the
interaction between signaling molecules and DRD1 receptors induces
the synthesis of cAMP in cells.

compounds: (A) AMP, (B) MAMP, (C) MDPV, (D) DA, and (E) pure cAMP
itself. These signature peaks are absent in the SERS spectrum from
pure signaling compounds (just signaling compounds without any signaling
compounds): (F) AMP, (G) MAMP, (H) MDPV, and (I) DA. The signature
peaks are also absent in the SERS spectrum obtained from (J) DRD1-expressed
HEK293 cells in the absence of the signaling compounds.

HEK293 cells in AMP (red line), MAMP (blue line), MDPV (black line),
and DA (green). The Raman peaks at 780 and 1503 cm–1 are only observed in DRD1-expressed cells, which were added to the
signaling compounds.

3.3 Probing of Intracellular cAMP in HT22 Cells
We extended the same experimental approach to test the interaction
between DRD1 and signaling molecules in mouse hippocampal neuronal
cells (HT22 cells). In this experiment, we overexpressed D1 DAR in
HT22 cells by following the same procedure as explained in the Materials and Experimental Section of this article.
In this experiment, we found that the interactions between DRD1-overexpressed
HT22 cells and signaling molecules increase the intracellular content
of cAMP. The synthesis of cAMP in HT22 cells was confirmed by observing
cAMP-related signature peaks at 780 and 1503 cm–1 in the SERS spectra obtained from DRD1-HT22 cells in the presence
of signaling compounds (Figure S9A–D). These signature peaks were not observed in DA-HT22 cells and DRD1-HT22
cells in the absence of signaling molecules (Figure S9E,F). Successful probing of intracellular cAMP in HT22 cells
verifies the possibility of our experimental approach to be applied
in varieties of living systems.

3.4 SERS
Peak Assignment of cAMP
cAMP
is an important second messenger, which is utilized as a marker in
this study to probe effective interactions between DRD1 and signaling
molecules such as DA, AMP, MAMP, and MDPV. We used the SERS spectra
of pure cAMP to compare the SERS spectrum obtained from intracellular
cAMP (Figure 4A–J).
On the basis of our experimental results and DFT calculations (Figure S3), we have assigned the Raman peaks
of cAMP compounds. Major SERS peaks obtained from the experimental
SERS spectrum of cAMP are provided in the Supporting Information (Figure S10). Briefly, Raman peaks of cAMP in the
lower-frequency region (<1000 cm–1) are related
to 780 cm–1: stretching of C–O, C–C,
and C–N bonds and symmetric and asymmetric bending of the O–H
bond; 824 cm–1: normal mode and bending of rings
(III) and (IV); 858 cm–1: C1–H28 bending and ring (III) and (IV) breathing modes; 946 cm–1: symmetric stretching and asymmetric bending of PO32–, stretching of O10–H13, C8–C19, and C19–C18 bonds, and C–H twisting in ring (I).
Raman peaks of cAMP in the higher-frequency region (>1000 cm–1) are related to 1013 cm–1: normal
mode, NH2 rocking, and symmetric stretching of PO32–; 1060 cm–1: ring (II) and
(III) stretching and
NH2 rocking; 1076 cm–1: C12–O9 stretching and CH2 rocking; 1096
and 1115 cm–1: ring stretching; 1145 cm–1: C–C stretching and CH2 rocking; 1177 cm–1: C–C stretching, O9–H3 bending,
and ring (II), (III), and (IV) breathing modes; 1228 cm–1: H28–C1–H21 bending
and NH2 rocking; 1270 cm–1: C–H
bending and C–N stretching; 1323 cm–1 and
1388 cm–1: C–H bending, C=N stretching,
and C–N stretching; 1407 cm–1: ring (III)
and (IV) stretching and C–H bending; 1503 cm–1: O9–H3 bending; 1556 cm–1: CH2 scissoring, ring (III) and (IV) stretching, and
NH2 scissoring; 1602 cm–1: ring (III)
and (IV) deformation and N–H bending. The assignment of experimental
SERS peaks obtained from the pure cAMP compound is summarized in Table
TS1.

3.5 SERS Peak Assignment of DRD1-HEK293 Cells
DARs can be controlled genetically in cells by overexpression,
knockdown, or knockout approaches. In our experiment, the overexpression
of DRD1 and DRD2 was easily tested and confirmed by fluorescence microscopy
because they were genetically tagged with tango and green fluorescence
proteins, respectively. The SERS spectra of HEK293 cells and HT22
cells were changed after overexpression of DARs. The assignment of
all SERS peaks of cells is difficult. Therefore, here we have just
assigned the prominent SERS peaks of DRD1-overexpressed HEK293 cells
(Figure S11). SERS peaks of DRD1-expressed
HEK293 cells in the low-frequency region (<1000 cm–1) are related to 790 cm–1: ω(Cδ−H)
(his); 863 cm–1: ω(Cδ−H) of hist
and τ(Cς–Nη2) of Arg; 916 cm–1: C–C stretch, Cδ wag, and Cα–Cβ
of Lys and ν(C–C) of phe. The SERS peaks in the higher-frequency
region (>1000) are related to 1002 cm–1: ring
deformation
of Phe; 1136 cm–1: NH3+ asymmetric
rocking and –OOC–Cα–Hα
of Lys; 1241 cm–1: CH2 twisting of Met;
1275 cm–1: Nδ−Cδ−H; Nγ–Cδ−H
of His; 1330 cm–1: CH2 wag of Met; 1392
cm–1: NH3+–C–H
and Cβ–Cα–Hα of Ile; 1454 cm–1: Hα–Cα–H, N–Cα–Hα,
and CH3 asymmetric deformation mode of Met; 1492 cm–1: Nδ−Cδ and Nδ−Cδ−H
of His; 1554 cm–1: amide II bands; and 1587 cm–1: –OOC asymmetric stretch of Ala,
Cγ–Cδ, Cβ–Cγ, and Nδ−Cγ–Cδ
stretch of His. These SERS peak assignments of DRD1-HEK293 cells are
based on our experimental results and literature values related to
the Raman frequency of the amino acid residue, which are summarized
in Table TS2.107−116

3.6 Characterization of Signaling Compounds
This study is successful to characterize the affinity of signaling
compounds toward DRD1 and DRD2. Four signaling compounds: AMP, MAMP,
MDPV, and DA induced the intracellular cAMP when they had interactions
with DRD1 (Figure 5A). However, these signaling compounds failed to induce intracellular
cAMP when they had interactions with DRD1–DRD2-co-overexpressed
cells (Figure 5D).
It is a well-established fact that the synthesis of intracellular
cAMP is induced by the interaction between DRD1 and its agonist and
depleted by the interaction between DRD2 and its agonist. On the basis
of this fact, we conclude that AMP, MAMP, MDPV, and DA are the agonists
for both DRD1 and DRD2 and they have equal affinity toward DRD1 and
DRD2.

4 Conclusions
When signaling compounds
such as DA, AMP, MAMP, or MDPV interact
effectively with D1 DARs, the level of cAMP is induced in cells. We
internalized silica-coated AgNPs (AgNP@SiO2) in cells,
which adsorbed the biologically synthesized cAMP molecules and served
as a SERS substrate to enhance the Raman cross section of cAMP. Our
experimental approach collected SERS spectra from intracellular cAMP
using low-power laser excitation with a short exposure time, which
is very useful for in vivo studies. Our experimental results and DFT
calculations showed that 780 and 1503 cm–1 are the
signature Raman wavenumbers of cAMP. The SERS peak of cAMP at 780
cm–1 is associated with C–O, C–C,
and C–N stretching and symmetric and asymmetric bending of
two O–H bonds, whereas the SERS peak at 1503 cm–1 is found to be contributed by the O9–H3 bending mode. On the basis of the intracellular level of induced
cAMP, we characterized the effective interaction between DRD1 and
its agonist and distinguished the affinity of signaling compounds
toward specific types of DARs. In this work, signaling compounds such
as AMP, MAMP, MDPV, and DA showed equal affinity toward both DRD1
and DRD2 DARs. In summary, our experimental approach is successful
to probe the overexpression of D1 and D2 DARs, measure the intracellular
level of cAMP, and characterize the affinity of signaling compounds
toward a specific DAR.
