One-dimensional
semiconductor nanowires often contain polytypic
structures, owing to the co-existence of different crystal phases.
Therefore, understanding the properties of polytypic structures is
of paramount importance for many promising applications in high-performance
nanodevices. Herein, we synthesized nanowires of typical III–V
semiconductors, namely, gallium phosphide and gallium arsenide by
using the chemical vapor transport method. The growth directions ([111]
and [211]) could be switched by changing the experimental conditions,
such as H2 gas flow; thus, various polytypic structures
were produced simultaneously in a controlled manner. The nanobeam
electron diffraction technique was employed to obtain strain mapping
of the nanowires by visualizing the polytypic structures along the
[111] direction. Micro-Raman spectra for individual nanowires were
collected, confirming the presence of wurtzite phase in the polytypic
nanowires. Further, we fabricated the photodetectors using the single
nanowires, and the polytypic structures are shown to decrease the
photosensitivity. Our systematic analysis provides important insight
into the polytypic structures of nanowires.

Introduction
Nanowires (NWs) of
wide-bandgap semiconductors have emerged as
well-defined one-dimensional building blocks of next-generation nanodevices.1 Group III–V semiconductor NWs are among
the most promising nanomaterials for many applications. The NWs often
adopt the hexagonal phase, such as the wurtzite (WZ) phase, in contrast
to the cubic zinc blende (ZB) phase of their bulk counterparts, and
thus, they produce various polytypic structures.2−8 Many studies have reported that the electrical and mechanical properties
of NWs are influenced by the stacking faults due to the two coexisting
phases.9−23 Polytypic structures are often disadvantageous for electronic devices,
because of the crystal defects that produce charge-trapping sites,
and thus reduce the (photo)current.9−18 On the other hand, polytypic NWs exhibit complicated mechanical
properties, which might come from the intrinsic difference between
materials.19−23 Liao’s group reported that polytypic GaAs NWs have a larger
elastic limit or a higher Young’s modulus than the WZ or ZB
phase counterpart.19,22 In contrast, the Zhu group reported
that the average Young’s modulus of obtuse-angle twin GaN NWs
was greatly reduced compared to defect-free NWs.21 Therefore, controlled synthesis of polytypic structures
and their characterization are important for assembling NWs in integrated
circuits.

In this work, we synthesized polytypic gallium phosphide
(GaP)
and gallium arsenide (GaAs) NWs as well as the single-crystalline
NWs. The growth directions ([111] and [211]) were controlled by the
conditions of the chemical vapor transport, such as H2 gas
flow. Various typed polytypic structures were exclusively produced
for the NWs grown along the [211] growth direction. We performed detailed
structure analysis of the polytypic structures using HRTEM combined
with strain mapping based on nanobeam electron diffraction (NBED).
The NBED technique utilizes electron beam precession to generate spot
diffraction patterns, thereby producing accurate strain maps with
<2 nm spatial resolution and 0.02% accuracy.24−26 This technique
enables the visualization of strain distribution along the individual
crystal directions.27,28 To identify the polytypic structures,
micro-Raman spectroscopy was employed, which is one of the most straightforward
and widely used techniques for this purpose. Further, the effect of
polytypic structures on the photodetectors was investigated, by fabricating
and comparing the photosensitivity using single-crystalline and polytypic
NWs.

Results and Discussion
Experimental details are described
in the Supporting Information. GaP and GaAs NWs were successfully synthesized,
and peaks in their XRD patterns were all matched exactly to those
of the ZB phase a = 5.450 Å (JCPDS card 32-0397)
and a = 5.654 Å (JCPDS card 80-0016), respectively,
as shown in Figure S1. The use of H2 gas was critical for the high-yield growth of NWs, because
otherwise the yield was very low. When the flow rate of H2 gas was 10 sccm, the NWs grew along the [111] direction. A remarkable
finding is that, when using a higher flow rate (50 sccm), the growth
direction switched to [2̅11]. The NWs with the [111] and [2̅11]
growth directions are simply referred to as [111] NWs and [211] NWs,
respectively, and hereafter labeled as GaP-1 and GaAs-1 and GaP-2
and GaAs-2 NWs. The GaP-1 and GaP-2 NWs had similar diameters (average
value: 150 nm), as shown by the diameter distribution in Figure S2. The average diameter of GaAs-1 and
GaAs-2 is the same as 180 nm.

Figure 1a shows
that the GaP NWs uniformly grew on the substrates with a high yield.
The NWs have the length of 50–100 μm. Figure 1b corresponds to the HRTEM
and FFT images of GaP-1, showing the defect-free single-crystalline
ZB phase with the [111] growth direction. There are no obvious outer
layers on the smooth and straight surface. The d-spacing
between the neighboring (111) planes was d111 = 3.15 Å, in good agreement with that of bulk GaP (3.1460 Å).

substrate. HRTEM image reveals a uniform diameter of 150 nm. Lattice-resolved
and the corresponding FFT images (zone axis = [011̅]) or SAED
pattern of selected (b) GaP-1 and (c–f) GaP-2.

As the H2 flow rate increased, the polytypic
GaP-2 NWs
were grown instead. Figure 1c reveals that the [111] direction of the polytypic structures
is perpendicular to the [2̅11] ([4̅22]) growth direction.
The polytypic structures consisted of alternative ZB (marked as 3C)
and WZ (marked as 2H) domains, as shown in the magnified view (inset).
The sizes of the ZB domains varied, resulting in the lined ED spots
along the [111] direction. The d422 value
was the same as that of bulk GaP (1.1127 Å). Other polytypes
were also found (see Figure S3).

Figure 1d shows
that another NW contains 9R (Ramsdell notation) polytypic structures
along the [1̅11] direction, which is tilted to the [111] growth
direction by 70.5°. The FFT image for the marked area shows three
periodic spots dividing the distance between the two adjacent (111)
plane reflections. The magnified FFT image was indexed using the rhombohedral
(R)-phase [21̅1̅0] zone axis. There are clearly three
periodic spots between two adjacent (0009)R [=(111)C] planes along the [0001] direction.6,29 The
SAED pattern for the NWs shown in Figure 1b–d is shown in Figure S4.

Figure 1e shows
a 19.5° bent GaP NW, in which the growth direction switched from
[211] (left segment) to [111] (right segment). The left segment has
the polytypic structure perpendicular to the [211] growth direction,
which is the same as that in Figure 1c. The right segment has the 70.5° tilted polytypic
structure as seen in Figure 1d. Figure 1f shows the 19.5° bent GaP-2 NW, in which the growth direction
changed from [211] to [111] toward the nanoparticle tip. The SAED
pattern confirmed that the 70.5° tilted polytypic structures
can be initiated from the perpendicular polytypic structures, followed
by a change in the growth direction from [211] to [111]. The tilted
polytypic structures were found as a minor portion (∼10%) compared
to the perpendicular polytypic structures. Korgel’s group reported
the lamella {111} twins in the kinked GaP NWs that changed the growth
direction from [111] to [112].30 Dayeh
et al. and Jeon et al. reported similar stacking
faults for kinked Ge NWs and Si–Ge heterostructure NWs, with
a 19.5° kink angle between the [111] and [211] growth directions.31,32

On the other hand, the GaAs NWs were synthesized with a high
yield
on Au-deposited substrates (Figures 2a,b). Figure 2c reveals that GaAs-1 consisted of single-crystalline ZB phase
with the [111] growth direction. When the H2 flow rate
(50 sccm) was higher than that (10 sccm) used for GaAs-1, GaAs-2 was
preferentially grown. Figure 2d shows a bicrystalline ZB-phase GaAs-2, in which the twin
structures are identified by the twin ED spots along the [111] direction,
which is perpendicular to the [211] growth direction. The d111 and d422 values
were 3.26 and 1.15 Å, respectively, which agree with those of
bulk GaAs (3.2643 and 1.1541 Å). The SAED pattern for the NWs
shown in Figure 2c,d
is shown in Figure S4.

GaAs NWs homogeneously grown on a
substrate. (b) HRTEM image reveals the uniform diameter (180 nm) of
the NWs. Lattice-resolved and corresponding FFT images (zone axis

Figure 3a
displays
the HAADF STEM image and EDX elemental mapping for the terminal part
of the GaP-1 NW, clearly revealing a round-shaped Au–Ga alloy
nanoparticle tip. The EDX spectrum reveals that the atomic ratio is
Au/Ga = 7:2 for the tip and Ga/P = 1:1 for the NW part. The concentration
of P could not be exactly determined because of the overlapped P K-shell
and Au M-shell peaks at approximately 2 keV. Therefore, the mapping
of P element shows the distribution at the tip. The SAED pattern (at
the zone axis of [0001]) for the tip part confirmed the hexagonal-phase
Au7Ga2 (JCPDS card 24-0424, P62m, a = 7.721 Å, and c = 8.751 Å).

Figure 3 (a) HAADF STEM image (scale bar = 100 nm), SAED
pattern for the
Au7Ga2 tip, EDX elemental mapping (using Au
L-shell, Ga K-shell, P K-shell, and As-K shell), and EDX spectra of
GaP-1, showing a composition of Au/Ga = 7:2 at the tip. HAADF STEM

cross section of the tip) of (b) bent and (c) straight GaP-2, showing
the compositions of Au/Ga = 2:1 and 1:1, respectively, for the Au2Ga and AuGa tips.

For bent GaP-2, the SAED pattern (zone axis = [131]) of the
tip
shows the orthorhombic-phase Au2Ga (JCPDS card 29-0619, a = 18.02 Å, b = 3.199 Å, and c = 6.999 Å) (Figure 3b). The EDX mapping and line profile along the cross
section of the nanoparticle tip reveal an atomic ratio of Au/Ga =
2:1, indicating a higher Ga composition than that of GaP-1. For straight
GaP-2, Au/Ga becomes 1:1 at the tip, corresponding to a higher Ga
composition than that of bent GaP-2 (Figure 3c). The SAED pattern at the [111] zone axis
reveals the orthorhombic-phase AuGa (JCPDS card 07-0126, Pbnm, a = 6.937 Å, b = 6.267 Å, c = 3.447 Å).

Figure 4a displays
the HAADF STEM image, SAED pattern, and EDX data of the GaAs-1. The
catalyst–NW interface of GaAs-1 is parallel to the (111) planes
of the NW. The EDX elemental mapping and EDX line profile reveal that
the atomic ratio is Au/Ga = 7:2 for the tip. The SAED pattern at the
zone axis of [0001] confirmed the hexagonal-phase Au7Ga2 nanoparticle. For GaAs-2, the EDX data reveal an atomic ratio
of Au/Ga = 1:1, indicating a higher Ga composition than that of GaAs-1
(Figure 4b). The SAED
pattern (zone axis = [112]) corresponds to the orthorhombic-phase
AuGa nanoparticle.

showing the composition of Au/Ga = 7:2 and 1:1, respectively, for
the Au7Ga2 and AuGa tips.

On the basis of the EDX data of Au–Ga alloy tips,
the growth
of GaP and GaAs NWs would follow a vapor–liquid–solid
growth mechanism using the Au nanoparticles. The H2 flow
facilitated the production of precursor vapors via the reaction 2GaP(s)
[or GaAs(s)] + 3H2(g) → 2Ga(g) + 2PH3(g) (or AsH3) and promoted vapor transport. Then, the
Ga vapors dissolved efficiently into the Au nanoparticles (forming
the Au–Ga alloy) and precipitated by the reaction with PH3 (or AsH3) at the triple-phase region (i.e., at
the interface between the NW solid, the Au liquid droplet, and the
gas phase), which induced the growth of single-crystalline [111] NWs
(GaP-1 and GaAs-1). As the length of NWs increases, it becomes increasingly
difficult to supply enough Ga and PH3 (or AsH3) onto the alloy tip, and eventually the growth of NW stops.

As the H2 flow rate increases, the higher vapor pressure
of precursors would increase the dissolution of Ga into the Au nanoparticles.
Therefore, the Ga composition in the Au nanoparticles is larger in
the [211] NWs (AuGa) than that in the single-crystalline [111] NWs
(Au7Ga2). We presume that, as the more Ga dissolved
in the Au nanoparticles, the growth rate would increase. Then, the
faster growth rate produces the [211] growth direction that is kinetically
favorable. On the other hand, the [111] growth direction is thermodynamically
favorable. The 19.5° kink at the termination part can be explained
by the following model: as the vapor pressure of precursors decreases
to slow down the growth rate, the growth direction turns from the
kinetically favorable [211] to the thermodynamically favorable [111]
direction. Therefore, the Ga composition in the Au nanoparticles depleted
to form the Au2Ga alloy as the growth direction switched
from [211] to [111].

Cheng et al. reported that the preferred
orientations of SiC films
are [111] and [110], respectively, in the lower and higher growth
rate conditions, consistent with our model that the [111] growth direction
is less kinetically favorable.33 Extensive
studies on cubic-phase Si NWs grown using a Au catalyst have reported
that the growth direction can be switched from [111] to [211] by increasing
the pressure of the precursor (e.g., SiH4, Si2H6).34−37 A similar phenomenon was found in the present work. Glas et al.
developed a nucleation-based model, in which high supersaturation
at the triple-phase region induces the formation of the WZ phase along
the [111] direction. This model was supported by many experimental
results.38 The production of the polytypic
structures here can also be explained by high supersaturation, which
is proven by the higher Ga concentration (50%, AuGa phase) at the
Au tip (GaP-2 and GaAs-2).

Now, we examine the strain maps of
GaP and GaAs NWs. The TEM image
and NBED pattern of the NWs were recorded at the [011̅] zone
axis. For the pure ZB-phase single-crystalline GaP-1 and GaAs-1, strain
mapping shows no strains along any crystal direction. Figure 5a corresponds to the strain
map of GaP-1 at the [111] growth direction. The strain map of GaP-2
at the [1̅11] polytypic direction, which is oriented 70.5°
away from the [111] growth direction, shows a lattice expansion of
1% in the region of polytypic structures (Figure 5b). As the orientation angle increases, the
lattice expansion decreases to almost zero. Another strain mapping
data of GaP-2 are shown in Figure 5c. The lattice expansion in the [111] direction, which
is perpendicular to the [2̅11] growth direction, reached a maximum
of 1% in the region of polytypic structures. Figure 5d corresponds to the strain map of GaAs-2,
showing that lattice expansion exists along the twinned boundaries
in the [111] direction, which is perpendicular to the [2̅11]
growth direction.

Figure 5 HRTEM image, NBED patterns (zone axis = [011̅]),
and the
corresponding strain maps of (a) GaP-1, (b,c) GaP-2, and (d) GaAs-2
along the [111] direction. In the NBED pattern, the [111] direction
is marked, namely, the top one for GaP-1 and GaP-2 (growth direction
= [111]) and the bottom one for GaP-2 and GaAs-2 (growth direction
= [211]). Strain maps of lattice contraction (blue means a negative
value) or expansion (red means a positive value), relative to a reference
at the single-crystalline region of the NW (marked by white dots),
where presumably no lattice deformation occurs, were taken in the
[111] polytypic direction. The relative extent of expansion or contraction
of the lattice (d) with respect to the reference
(d0), i.e., (d – d0)/d0. The scale
bars indicate the range of the strain (±1%). The precision of
the strain measurement was <0.03%, and the spatial resolution was
2 nm.

The lattice constant of the WZ-phase
GaP NWs has been measured
as a = 3.8419 Å and c = 6.3353
Å, which differ from the values when the lattice parameters of
ZB are geometrically converted into the WZ unit cell.39 The lattice mismatch between the WZ phase (d002 = 3.1677 Å) and the ZB phase (d111 = 3.1460 Å) is ca. Δc =
0.69%. The lattice constant of the WZ-phase GaAs NWs was reported
as a = 3.9845 Å and c = 6.5701
Å,40 and the lattice mismatch with
the ZB phase (d002 = 3.2851 Å vs d111 = 3.2643 Å) is Δc = 0.64%. The lattice expansion in the [111] polytypic direction
would originate from the larger lattice parameter of the WZ phase
than that of the ZB phase (Δc). It is emphasized
that the strain mapping can be used to visualize the polytypic structures
using the lattice mismatch between the different crystal phases.

Micro-Raman spectra were measured for the individual NWs using
a 514.5 nm excitation source. In Figure 6a, the Raman spectra of GaP-1 and GaP-2 NWs
both showed a transverse optical (TO) mode peak at 366 cm–1 and a longitudinal optical (LO) mode peak at 400 cm–1. GaP-2 showed the E2H mode peak at a lower-frequency
region of the TO band at 357 cm–1 (9 cm–1 red shift), originating from the WZ phase of the polytypic structures.41 GaP-1 showed the asymmetric shape of the TO
band. The shoulder peak at 360 cm–1, red-shifted
from the TO mode by 6 cm–1, would originate from
a frequency-dependent damping oscillator as Bakker suggested.42 Measurement of polarization-dependent micro-Raman
spectra confirmed the spectral features of each peak and the absence
of hexagonal phase in GaP-1, as shown in Figure S5. Therefore, the significant intensity of the E2H mode peak is definitely correlated with the polytypic
structures of GaP-2 NWs.

Figure 6 Micro-Raman spectra of (a) GaP-1 and GaP-2 and
(b) GaAs-1 and GaAs-2
NWs, and the bands (colored lines) resolved from the spectral peaks
using a Voigt function. The black line represents the sum of the resolved
bands, showing a good fit to the data points. Raman signals were obtained
using an Ar ion laser with a wavelength of 514.5 nm.

The Raman spectra of GaAs-1 and GaAs-2 consisted
of the TO and
LO mode peaks at 269 and 288 cm–1, respectively
(Figure 6b). It has
been reported that the E2H mode of GaAs at 255–256
cm–1 is red-shifted from the TO mode by approximately
10 cm–1.43 No band was
resolved below the frequency of the TO mode, probably owing to the
negligible amount of hexagonal phase.

We fabricated a photodetector
device by aligning the NWs between
a prepatterned Ti/Au bottom electrode using a dielectrophoresis method
and depositing a Pt top electrode using the FIB technique. Figure 7a shows the I–V curves of the photodetector
device using single-crystalline GaP-1 and polytypic GaP-2, both under
dark conditions and under 325 nm irradiation (3.8 eV) using a He–Cd
laser (80 mW cm–2). The SEM images show that the
NW was aligned between the bottom and top electrodes with gaps of
2–2.5 and 7–10 μm, respectively (insets). Figure 7b corresponds to
the I–t curves at a bias
voltage of 5 V under 1 min periodic light on/off cycles. Micro-Raman
spectroscopy was used to identify the polytypic structures of each
NW (see Figure S6).

Figure 7 (a) I–V characteristics
of GaP NWs under 325 nm (80 mW cm–2) irradiation
and under dark conditions. (b) I–t curves at a bias voltage of 5 V under chopped irradiation. (c) I–V and (d) I–t curves (at a bias voltage of 2 V) of single GaAs NW under
365 nm (60 mW cm–2) irradiation and under dark conditions.
The SEM images show the single NW aligned between Ti/Au bottom electrodes
with a 2–2.5 μm gap, with Pt top electrode deposition
using FIB (insets).

The photocurrent (ΔI) at 5 V is about 45
nA and 25 pA, respectively, for GaP-1 and GaP-2. The photocurrent
of GaP-1 is much higher than that of GaP-2 and exhibits better stability.
The photosensitivity, defined as ΔI/I0, where I0 is the
current under dark conditions, is as large as 560 for GaP-1. Spectral
responsivity (R) is defined as the photocurrent generated
when unit light intensity (P) shines on the effective
area of NW (A): R = ΔI/PA. The GaP-1 and GaP-2 exhibits R = 1.7 × 102 and 9.6 × 10–2 A W–1, respectively. Another quantity to characterize
the performance of photodetector is its specific detectivity (D*). In the case of small noise from dark current, D* = R × (A/2eI0)1/2. The respective
values are 2.4 ×1013 and 1.2 ×1010 Jones (= cm Hz1/2 W–1), confirming
that the GaP-1 is more suitable for the photodetectors than the GaP-2.
We also measured the photocurrents for the other NWs, proving that
all GaP-2 NWs exhibit at least 100 times less photocurrents than that
of GaP-1 NWs (Figure S7). Therefore, we
concluded that the GaP-1 is more suitable for the photodetectors than
the GaP-2. The stacking faults of the polytypic structures could play
as the trapping sites for the generation/transport of photocarriers
and thus decrease the photocurrent. Therefore, the polytypic structures
are indeed disadvantageous, which is consistent with previous works.9−18

Figure 7c,d
shows
the I–V and I–t curves of the photodetector device fabricated
using the GaAs NWs, respectively. The photocurrents from many NWs
[under 365 nm irradiation (3.4 eV) using a LED (60 mW cm–2)] were all similar (ΔI = 1.7 μA at
2 V), being much higher than that of GaP NWs. The polytypic structure
of GaAs-2 is negligible, so the photocurrents are nearly the same
although the growth direction is different. The corresponding values
of R and D* are 4.6 × 103 A W–1 and 4.5 × 1011 Jones,
respectively. These values are comparable to the previous GaAs NW
detectors by other groups.44−48 The photocurrent data of GaAs NWs support the result of GaP NWs,
in which the polytypic structures play a major role in decreasing
the photocurrent.

In dark conditions, the nonlinear I–V curve was ascribed to the Schottky
barrier between the
NW and Au contact. Under light irradiation, the I–V curve becomes more linear. This can be
explained using the metal-induced gap states (MIGSs) model.49 The photogenerated holes drifted toward the
negative biased electrode are trapped in the MIGSs. Because of the
increased positive charge density in the depletion region, its Schottky
barrier lowers and the space charge region shrinks. Then, the thermionic
emission and the thermally assisted tunneling contribute in increasing
the photocurrent for low applied voltage. We also fabricated the field
effect transistors using the GaP-1 and GaAs-1 NWs, as shown in Figure S8. The measurement of gate effect revealed
that both GaP and GaAs NWs are p-type semiconductors with carrier
mobilities of 0.031 and 0.053 cm2 V–1 s–1, respectively. The Ho group reported that
the surface oxide shell layer of GaAs NWs induces the acceptor-like
interface trapping defects, which reduce the carrier concentrations
in the NWs, leading to p-type conduction.50 Although the TEM images did not detect any distinctive shell layers,
the low mobilities would be ascribed to the atomic oxide outer layers
that inevitably formed under ambient conditions.

Conclusions
GaP
and GaAs NWs were synthesized using the chemical vapor transport
method. The ZB-phase NWs were grown in the [111] and [211] directions,
respectively, under lower and higher H2 gas flow rates.
The single-crystalline NWs were grown with the [111] growth direction.
In contrast, the GaP [211] NWs exhibit a remarkable variety of polytypic
structures, whereas the GaAs [211] NWs have a twinned structure. We
propose that the [211] growth direction becomes kinetically favored
under higher vapor pressure of precursors (i.e., higher H2 flow rates), supported by the higher Ga concentration in Au nanoparticles,
Au7Ga2 and AuGa, respectively, for the [111]
and [211] growth directions. The production of the polytypic structures
can also be explained by high supersaturation. The NBED technique
was employed to obtain the strain maps of the NWs, which help visualize
the distribution of polytypic structures. The single-crystalline GaP
and GaAs NWs exhibit no strains. In contrast, all polytypic NWs exhibit
lattice expansion along the [111] direction, because of the larger
lattice parameter (d002) of the WZ phase
than that (d111) of the ZB phase. Micro-Raman
spectra of individual GaP NWs identified the polytypic structures
from the WZ-phase E2H peak. Further, we fabricated
photodetectors using these NWs, and the results showed a significant
decrease of photocurrents for the polytypic structures. The controlled
synthesis, the characterization, and the photocurrent measurement
here provide valuable insights into the polytypic structures of the
NWs.

Experimental Section
GaP (99.999%, Alfa Aesar) or GaAs (99.999%,
Alfa Aesar) powders
(40–80 mg) and a 3 nm thick Au film deposited on a Si substrate
were placed inside a quartz tube (2.5 cm diameter and 80 cm length)
reactor. The substrate was positioned 10 cm away from the source powders.
The temperature of the source was set to 1000 °C, and that of
the substrates at the cooling zone was approximately 800 °C.
The tube reactor was heated using an electrical furnace. Argon gas
was continuously flowed at a rate of 200 sccm during the whole process.
As the temperature reaches the set value, hydrogen gas was added for
1 h, with a rate of 10–50 sccm. After the growth terminates,
the substrates were cooled under ambient conditions. Characterization,
fabrication of electrode, and measurement/analysis are described in
