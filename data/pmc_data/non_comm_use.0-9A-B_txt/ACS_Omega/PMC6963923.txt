Esters of furan dicarboxylic acids (DAFs) were synthesized
by a
one-pot reaction between marine biomass-derived galactaric acid and
bioalcohol under solvent-free conditions and were fully characterized.
The catalyst amount could be reduced without loss of reaction yields
using p-xylene as the material separation agent.
Also, a possible mechanism was proposed for the first time. Then the
properties of four DAFs as plasticizers on the poly(vinyl chloride)
(PVC) matrix were investigated. The experimental results showed that
DAFs exhibit competitive efficiencies of plasticization when compared
to the most commercialized plasticizer, DOP. It was found that the
combination of DAFs and PVC produced homogeneous smooth-surface films,
indicating miscibility between them. ATR-FTIR depicted the upshift
of carbonyl absorption bands after mixing with the PVC matrix, with
a magnitude of at most 18–21 cm–1. TGA, DSC,
and UTM data illustrated equivalent plasticization efficiencies. Due
to their small molecular weights, the investigated DAFs are more volatile.
However, due to bearing an oxygen atom in the aromatic furan ring,
the degree of polarization of DAFs was boosted and helped inhibit
leaching into the surrounding media. In brief, these synthetic compounds
have promising feasibility as biobased plasticizers. Moreover, another
interesting point is that the properties of furan-2,3-dicarboxylic
acid derivatives were studied for the first time and herein reported.

Introduction
Defined by IUPAC in 1951, plasticizer
is “a substance or
material incorporated in a material (usually a plastic or elastomer)
to increase its flexibility, workability, or dispensability”.1 Plasticizers are inserted into polymeric structures
without a chemical reaction and remain between the chains to help
them separate. As a result, an originally rigid, brittle, and hard
polymer then becomes soft, flexible, and easy to process.2 In the global market, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate
(dioctyl phthalate, DOP), belonging to the phthalate family, is the
most commercial. Phthalates dominate the market, encompassing approximately
90% of all plasticizers produced each year.2,3 The
production is so massive, owing to low cost, high demand, and indulging
properties exhibited in the polymer matrix. On the contrary, DOP is
also well-known for its toxicity in living organisms, eco-unfriendliness,
and petroleum-origin.1−4 These accumulate and in turn become concerns when DOP plasticizes
from the third most-used polymer, poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC). While
PVC has a wide range of applications, from industry to medical and
housing purposes, on grounds of excellent physical properties, and
chemical resistance at a cheap price. A substitute for phthalates,
DOP in particular, is inevitable to sustain future demand.2

As the world’s limited amount of
fossil resources becomes
depleted and the increasing emission of carbon dioxide contributes
to global warming,5 renewable and sustainable
biomass has become a hopeful alternative for fossil resources.6,7 In particular, biomass-derived carbohydrates have great potential
because they are the most abundant among all the biomass-containing
carbon components. While they account for 75% of all carbon-based
biomass, less than 5% are used for food or nonfood purposes.8,9 Biomass-derived carbohydrates can be selectively dehydrated into
furanic compounds via chemical reaction or biological fermentation
pathways,10,11 and they are highlighted as potential biobased
candidates for the replacement of petroleum-based aromatics.12−15 Therefore, much effort has been made to transform carbohydrates
into furanic fuels and chemicals.16−21 Sources for carbohydrates generally come from terrestrial crops
and wood (lignocellulose), but recently, another kind of biomass,
which is seaweed (macroalgae) from the ocean, has attracted attention
in recent years.22 There are several advantages
in marine-based macroalgae. First, they have a higher growth rate
than land-based crops and trees, allowing for multiple harvests per
annum, without feeding additional fertilizer or pesticide or even
irrigating.23 Second, they do not require
land area for cultivation, which can prevent land competition with
crops and the environmental destruction of forests. Third, the effectiveness
of CO2 remediation, which is crucial to reduce greenhouse
gases, is outstanding by comparison with land plants.24 Fourth, their carbohydrate content is high with no lignin;
thus, the carbohydrates can be readily extracted from the original
feedstock.25 Noticeably, marine-based carbohydrates
contain galactose-type monosaccharides such as agarose, while land-based
carbohydrates consist of glucose-type monosaccharides such as starch
and cellulose. Unlike glucose, galactose is oxidized to the optically
inactive galactaric acid (Gal-dA, trivially called mucic acid), and
galactaric acid precipitates during oxidation with nitric acid due
to its low solubility in water;26 therefore,
it can be readily isolated and employed as a starting material for
various value-added chemicals.

Furan-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (2,5-FDCA)
is a natural di-acid found
inside the human body and was prominently named among the top 12 priority
biobased molecules for the future “green” industry by
the U.S. Department of Energy. 2,5-FDCA is encouraged and gradually
replaces the fossil-originated terephthalic acid.27,28 Studies have been conducted to convert biomass into 2,5-FDCA since
1876. At the time, Fittig and Heinzelman were pioneers who dehydrated
galactaric acid with fuming HBr.29 In 2008,
Taguchi et al.33 reported that furan-2,5-
and furan-2,3-dicarboxylic acid esters (DAFs) could be coproduced
from Gal-dA. Such a revelation not only paved the way for synthesizing
another regioisomer of 2,5-FDCA directly from biomass but also introduced
2,3-FDCA as a new building block. Generally speaking, FDCAs are capable
of substituting phthalate substances whose market size is now worth
millions of U.S. dollars. From the strategic perspectives of marine
biomass and FDCAs, four furanic compounds were successfully synthesized
for our research, namely, di-n-butyl furan-2,3-dicarboxylate
(2,3-DBF), di-n-butyl furan-2,5-dicarboxylate (2,5-DBF),
diisoamyl furan-2,3-dicarboxylate (2,3-DIAF), and diisoamyl furan-2,5-dicarboxylate
(2,5-DIAF) (depicted in Figure 1). During the synthesis, a possible reaction mechanism was
proposed for the first time due to the discovery of by-products, which
are alkyl 2-furoates. The four investigated compounds with the poly(vinyl
chloride) powder were then utilized to cast thin plastic films followed
by a series of evaluating methods. As a further matter, 2,3-FDCA and
its derivatives have not been well studied so far, making this class
of compounds popular among the scientific society. This report, which
comprises the detailed information, is worthy of attention.

from marine biomass and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DOP).

This study has focused on the synthesis of furanics
from natural
materials and on the investigation of their properties. It is literally
a combination of bio-basis in the green chemistry with plasticizers
(PLS) in the polymer industry, meeting the current research progress.
Oils from castor, soybean, and tung tree or multi-carboxylic acids
(like citric acid) are good examples for synthesis of bio-based plasticizers.1,3,29 Our study aims at (a) producing
FDCA derivatives from galactaric acid (marine biomass10,11) in alcoholic media (bio-butyl/isoamyl alcohols30,31) and then (b) utilizing them to plasticize the rigid polymers. As
a result, these bio-plasticizers can be alternatives for petroleum-based
phthalates, especially DOP.

Experimental Section
Materials
Activated charcoal (4–14 mesh), 1-butanol
(BuOH, >99.5%), galactaric acid (Gal-dA, 97%, also known as mucic
acid), 3-methyl-1-butanol (98%, also known as isoamyl alcohol), molecular
sieves type 3 Å (UOP, pellets, 3.2 mm), poly(vinyl chloride)
(PVC, powder, Mw ∼80000, Mn ∼47000), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, >99.5%), sodium chloride (NaCl, 99%), sulfuric
acid
98% fume (H2SO4), tetrahydrofuran (THF, anhydrous,
inhibitor-free, >99.9%), and p-xylene (PX, 99%)
were
all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Korea). Analytical-grade solvents
(n-hexane, ethyl acetate, methanol, etc.) were obtained
from Samchun Chemicals (Korea). Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DOP,
>98%) was purchased from TCI Chemicals (Japan), which was used
as
the reference plasticizer chemical.

Synthetic Procedure
In a Dean–Stark apparatus,
galactaric acid (Gal-dA, 3.0 g, 14 mmol) was suspended in an alcohol
medium (324 mmol). The suspension was heated at the boiling point
of 1-butanol before adding concentrated H2SO4 (1.2 g, 12 mmol) and p-xylene (PX, 3.5 g, 33 mmol)
in a dropwise manner. Then the temperature was raised to and was kept
at 160 °C. After 10 h, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool
down and was diluted with ethyl acetate followed by washing with saturated
solution of NaCl and aqueous solution of Na2CO3 (10%, w/w). The organic phase was dried over the molecular sieve
and evaporated under reduced pressure. The viscous crude product was
purified by flash chromatography over silica gel (60 Å, 230–400
mesh) from Sigma-Aldrich (USA) under a UV lamp at 245 and 265 nm simultaneously.
Reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC, silica
gel Merck 60 F254 plates), and then spots on TLC were seen
under a UV lamp at 254 nm and/or were stained by a solution of potassium
permanganate in ethanol.

From the above reaction, 2,5-DBF and
2,3-DBF were obtained. The 2,5-DIAF and 2,3-DIAF could be produced
under identical conditions, with isoamyl alcohol instead of butanol
(Scheme 1).

(DAFs)
Preparation of Plasticized PVC Films
The PVC powder
(2.5 g) was dissolved in ∼55 mL of THF together with a plasticizer
and was stirred for at least 3 h. The homogeneous solution was then
cast on a clean, dustless Petri dish. The solvent was allowed to freely
evaporate overnight to obtain flexible films. Then they were put in
a vacuum oven at 35 °C for 24 h. The complete formulations of
the film-preparing process and designation of plastic films are listed
in Table S8.

It is known that, after
drying, there is little amount of residual THF solvent. The last 2–3%,
which is hard to remove completely, could have an impact on plasticization
effects.

Characterizations
After purification, the four target
furanic compounds were structurally characterized. 1H-
and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Spectrospin
300 (Germany) in chloroform-d (CDCl3)
as the solvent and deuterated tetramethylsilane (Me4Si)
as the internal standard. The chemical shifts (δ) and coupling
constants (J) are expressed in parts per million
(ppm) and hertz (Hz), respectively. Infrared spectra (FTIR) were recorded
using a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer from Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc. (USA) with 32 scans, the resolution being 4 cm–1. The mass spectroscopy spectra (EI-MS+) were recorded on a Shimadzu
GCMS-QP-2010 Ultra integrated with a Shimadzu GC for mass spectrometer
GC-2010 Plus (Japan).

Morphology studies of platinum-coated
(1–2 nm thick) film samples were conducted on a field-emission
scanning electron microscopic (FE-SEM) system JSM-6701F, provided
by JEOL (Japan). Infrared spectra (FTIR) were recorded using the same
machine aforementioned but equipped with a Smart MIRacle Accessory
ZnSe crystal for the attenuated total reflectance (ATR) technique.

A TGA 4000 system from PerkinElmer (USA) was used to perform thermogravimetric
analyses (TGA). About 12–15 mg of each film in the absence
of a suitable stabilizer was put into a ceramic cup without a lid,
from the same instrument provider. Heating the sample from 25 to 700
°C at 10 °C/min under nitrogen gas flow (20 mL/min) gave
information about thermal degradation of the PVC-based material.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a DSC
8000 instrument from PerkinElmer (USA). Small film pieces with weights
of 7–10 mg were thermally scanned from −50 to 200 °C
at a 10 °C/min rate under nitrogen gas flow (20 mL/min).

Tensile properties of polymer-PLS materials were tested on a universal
testing machine (UTM) from Zwick Roell (Z005 model, Germany) based
upon the ASTM D882-12 standard. At least six or more tensile specimens
were prepared from each film. Specimens were preconditioned for not
less than 48 h. The standard distance between grips was 25 mm; the
rate of grip separation was 2.5 mm/min for E-modulus determination.

PVC-PLS 100phr films were cut into 20 × 20 mm2 pieces
before migration resistance examination. Standards ASTM D1203-10 (method
A) and ASTM D5227-13 were adapted for evaluation of plasticizers.
The test results are expressed in parts percent, describing how much
in quantity the plasticizer is migrated under the given conditions.
The volatility test was performed at 70 °C for 24 h, and detailed
conditions are described in the Supporting Information (Section S9).

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Proposed Mechanism
It is known that the
dehydration of galactaric acid (Gal-dA) under acidic conditions gives
furandicarboxylic acid.34,33,32 However, due to its unusually
dense structure and large lattice energy,35,36 the reaction required excessive amounts of dehydrating agent up
to 200 wt % or more under certain conditions. This, in turn, made
the reaction vigorous, not green, and needed neutralization afterward.
A modification is required so that the amount of acid catalyst can
be considerably reduced without much influencing the reaction yield.
In a Dean–Stark apparatus were added Gal-dA, butanol, p-xylene (PX), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Gal-dA was not initially dissolved in the alcoholic medium, but
later, the suspension gradually turned into a homogeneous solution
as the acid-catalyzed reaction progressed under reflux conditions.
H2SO4 was chosen as an acid catalyst, while
PX was considered as a material separation agent (MSA), which can
change the molecular interactions, remove water exhaustively, and
further eliminate the azeotrope if existing. The reaction resulted
in the formation of two regioisomeric dibutyl furandicarboxylates,
namely, 2,3-DBF and 2,5-DBF. It is obvious to speculate that Gal-dA
could experience (a) an intramolecular etherification of two hydroxyl
groups (at C2 and C5 positions) to form a five-membered ring followed
by (b) dehydration inside the ring and (c) esterification to create
2,5-DBF. However, the existence of the 2,3-regioisomer is a thing
that is hard to give an explanation to since the two −COOH
groups of the original Gal-dA are terminal. On top of that, monitoring
by TLC and via GC–MS during and after the reaction found butyl
2-furoate, which has not been reported before. The production of either
dibutyl 2,3-furandicarboxylate (2,3-DBF) or butyl 2-furoate raised
complications to the reaction mechanism but hinted at a chance of
growing awareness of its nature.

To optimize the reaction conditions,
the effect of acid amounts on product yields was investigated in the
BuOH medium (Figure 2a). More than 90% total yield (mixture of 2,5- and 2,3-DBF) after
10 h could be achieved in the presence of 50 wt % H2SO4 to Gal-dA. A decreased amount of acid, 20 wt % H2SO4 to Gal-dA, caused a decrease in the reaction rate,
thus resulting in only 38% total yield after 10 h. In fact, as stated
previously, at least 100 wt % H2SO4 to Gal-dA
was required to achieve a total yield (GC yield) over 90% of DBFs
after 9 h, unless MSA was used.33 Nevertheless,
50 wt % acid was still a large amount. In an effort to improve the
reaction conditions, further optimization of the MSA was carried out.
As shown in Figure 2b, the composition of MSA (mol % PX to BuOH plus PX) was closely
related to the reaction rate. The maximum total yield after 10 h was
obtained at the specific composition of MSA. The amount of H2SO4 for quantitative yields after 10 h could be reduced
to 30 wt % at 9.5 mol % MSA composition.

Figure 2 DBF yields from Gal-dA
according to (a) amounts of acid (H2SO4) and
(b) composition of material separation
agent (PX). Reaction conditions: Gal-dA (5.0 g, 24 mmol), BuOH (40.0
g, 540 mmol), H2SO4 (30 wt %) for panel (b),
PX (5.0 g, 47 mmol) for panel (a), 160 °C (reflux), 10 h.

In addition, synthetic efficiencies of various
C4-C8 alkyl alcohols
including n-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, i-pentyl, and i-octyl (2-ethylhexyl, in
particular) alcohols were evaluated (Table 1). As the chain length of the alkyl group
was prolonged, total yields of the DAFs were decreased under identical
conditions. When n-butyl alcohol and i-pentyl alcohol were employed (entries 1 and 6), almost quantitative
amounts of the desired products were afforded on the basis of Gal-dA.
On the other hand, approximately 50% was yielded from C8 alkyl alcohols
such as n-octyl and i-octyl alcohols
(entries 5 and 7). This implies that the long alkyl chains hamper
intramolecular cyclization of dialkyl galactarate due to steric hindrance.
Noticeably, other by-products were also detected. They were homologous
compounds of butyl 2-furoate, which was mentioned above. This suggested
that this class of furoate compounds exists during and after the reaction
and plays a role in the events of the reaction mechanism, possibly
being a key intermediate in between Gal-dA and DAFs. To generalize,
the conversion of Gal-dA led to two regioisomeric furandicarboxylates
(2,5- and 2,3-DAFs) as well as 2-furoate. Characterizations are all
presented in the Supporting Information.

b Isolation yield.

Until now, the reaction mechanism for this transformation
has not
been unveiled, especially in the case of 2,3-DAF. The mechanism is
believed to be sophisticated because many events including esterification
and dehydration take place simultaneously. Here, the mechanism for
the one-pot multistep reaction of Gal-dA to 2,3- and 2,5-DAF is proposed
in Scheme 2. Initially,
acid-catalyzed esterification of Gal-dA with an alcohol produces dialkyl
galactarate (routes A–D). The diester of Gal-dA is dominantly
formed and can be spontaneously crystallized out of the reaction mixture
in case that the reaction time fails to meet 10 h long. It is then
transformed to 1AB by dehydration at the C4 position
(routes A and B) followed by tautomerization from the enol to keto
form. Afterward, an intramolecular cyclization leads to a five-membered
cyclic compound 2AB. In this stage, two molecules of
water from 2AB are eliminated to give 2,5-DAF (route
B). Meanwhile, the dehydration of only one molecule of water generates
compound 3AB. Dimerization of 3AB by transesterification
and then decarboxylation of the dimer compound 4A results
in compound 5A. Compound 5A, which is alkyl
2-furoate, is detectable during and after the reaction. Carbonylation
of 5A with released CO2 can generate compound 6A, and esterification of 6A with an alcohol
affords 2,3-DAF (route A). On the other hand, dialkyl galactarate
can undergo another intramolecular cyclization by etherification between
the OH groups at the C2 and C5 positions to afford a five-membered
cyclic compound 1CD (routes C and D). Dehydration of 1CD at the C3 and C5 positions forms a furan ring to give
2,5-DAF (route C). Additionally, the carbonyl group at the C5 position
of 1CD activated under acidic conditions can promote
an intramolecular cyclization to afford the bicyclic compound 2D. From 2D, two molecules of water are released
to give 2,3-DAF via 3D (route D). From this mechanism,
we can speculate that routes B and C for 2,5-DAFs are preferable to
routes A and D for 2,3-DAFs because routes B and C require only a
dehydration step from intermediates 1CD and 2AB. Consequently, 2,5-DAFs are yielded as major products.

Scheme 2 Possible
Reaction Mechanism To Synthesize 2,3- and 2,5-DAF from Gal-dA
Miscibility and Interaction with Poly(vinyl chloride)
To examine compatibility of four target bio-plasticizers (PLS) in
a PVC matrix, the surface morphologies of the PVC-PLS films were analyzed
with FE-SEM images at a magnification of 3000×. There was no
obvious phase separation between PLS and the matrix in all of the
cases, indicating a compatibility between them. Chain length (C4 or
C5) and position (para or ortho)
of the alkyl ester groups attached to the furan ring had little effect
on the surface morphology. Unlike the blends made by mixing at elevated
temperatures,37,38 the surface of PVC-PLS films
cast from solution was homogeneous, smooth, and flat even though the
amount of PLS increased to 100phr (Figures S69–S73).

The molecular interactions between the polymer matrix and
plasticizers were studied, focusing on the major frequency differences
between the absorption bands of the PVC-PLS combinations and the pure
form of PLS. The interaction between DOP and PVC has been well researched
in which the H atom attached to the chlorine-bearing C atom of the
PVC acts as the electron acceptor and the O atom of the carbonyl group
of DOP is an electron donor.39,40 The interaction results
in a shift of carbonyl-related bands to a lower frequency. The peak
of the carbonyl absorbance of DOP at 1724 cm–1 slightly
moved to 1720 cm–1 in the PVC-DOP films. Considering
that there was no change of peaks corresponding to C=C stretching
bands at 1600 and 1579 cm–1 in the PVC-DOP films,
the aromatic benzene ring of DOP seemed unaffected by the C–Cl
of PVC (Figure 3a and Table S9). Unlike DOP, with only a carbonyl O
atom for interacting with PVC, the four synthetic furanic compounds
investigated in this study (namely, 2,5-DBF, 2,5-DIAF, 2,3-DBF, and
2,3-DIAF) bear an extra O atom in the aromatic furan ring as well
as the carbonyl O atom(s). As a result, the peaks of the C–O
stretching bands, ranging 1300–1000 cm–1,
were more complicated, owing to the additional C–O bonds in
the furan ring. High peak intensities of the C=C stretching band in
the range of 1700–1450 cm–1 indicate that
the furan ring is polarized. When these furanic compounds were added
to PVC, the absorption bands were shifted with various absolute magnitudes
from at least 0 to 2 cm–1. Noticeably, C=O bands
of para-substituted 2,5-DBF/2,5-DIAF were even moved
to higher frequencies by 8–12 cm–1, and those
of ortho-substituted 2,3-DBF/2,3-DIAF were enhanced
greatly to 18–21 cm–1 and became broader.
These observations suggest two aspects. First, these interactions
of furanic compounds with PVC were intense and comparably multiple
times stronger than that of DOP in terms of the absolute interaction
magnitude. Second, with either 8–12 or 18–21 cm–1 enhancement of C=O bands, it was about a disorder
that would happen to the π-electron system of furanic compounds
after interacting with PVC since electronic factors (inductive, mesomeric
effects) are often responsible for such a shift. Further studies are
needed to fully understand the main reasons leading to big shifts
of absorption bands.

films

(d) 2,3-DBF, and (e) 2,3-DIAF.

Plasticizing Efficiencies on Flexibility
DSC experiments
were conducted to understand the thermal behavior of the investigated
materials. A prescan was performed to collect thermal properties of
DAF products as well as neat PVC powder. Within the scanning range
from −20 to 150 °C, melting points (Tm) of DAFs and the glass transition temperature (Tg) of neat PVC were determined, but unfound
were the Tg values of DAFs or DOP. Consequently,
to the mixture of PVC-PLS, only Tg from
PVC was observable during the scanning range.

A good miscibility
by a primary plasticizer like DOP41,42 is expressed
through a single Tg representing a new
entity. On the other hand, in the case of limited or poor miscibility
between an additive and a polymer matrix, numerous Tg values would appear.42 Because
of unequal distribution of plasticizer content, the matrix would consist
of several different parts where they are either well-plasticized
or possibly unplasticized, and by that, they are each reflected through
a unique Tg value. Practical data from
DSC experiments informed an only Tg for
any PVC-PLS combination (data plotted in Figure 4). As can be seen from the diagram, the Tg value and the plasticizer content appear unproportional.
The growth in the amount of plasticizer downgrades the glass-liquid
transition of PVC materials. To put it another way, the insertion
of the plasticizer into the matrix provides more free volume for motion
of polymer chains, letting the mixture to be more flexible.43 Another observation is that DAFs’ tendency
of plasiticization seems familiar with DOP’s. To be more specific,
the para-substituted DAFs (2,5-DBF and 2,5-DIAF)
exhibited a very similar pattern to DOP. Meanwhile, the ortho-substituted ones (2,3-DBF and 2,3-DIAF) followed the trend but with
a relatively higher set of Tg values.
This result can be explained based upon the chemical structure. Although
alkyl chains of 2,5-DBF/2,5-DIAF (C4 or C5) are shorter than DOP (C8),
their molecular volume may be equivalent to that of DOP because the
two substituents are spread in opposite directions, whereas 2,3-DBF/2,3-DIAF
having both substituents on the same side can just provide smaller
free volume for the polymer chains.

Figure 4 Dependence of Tg on the amount of plasticizers
in PVC-PLS films.

From Figure 4, the Tg of neat PVC is 80.77
°C, which agrees
reasonably well with the value of 83 °C that has previously been
reported for PVC.44,45 However, the Tg of PVC plasticized with DOP obtained in our experiment
is less than that expected from the literature. The literature45 shows that the Tg of PVC plasticized with 50phr DOP is 24.6 °C, but our value
is 16 °C, which was obtained by interpolation of Figure 4 and Table S14. This is likely due to the presence of residual THF. According
to the literature,46,47 it is very difficult to remove
THF from PVC after its use as a solvent in making cast films, and
the residual THF can have a plasticizing effect on the polymer. As
much as 6–8% THF can remain in the PVC after casting and drying,
and at least 2–3% is very difficult to remove.

To sum
up at this point, the addition of the plasticizer provides
free volume for motion of polymer chains. 2,5-DAFs were able to generate
the equivalence of free volume as DOP due to the opposite aliphatic
moieties, following an order of DOP ≈ 2,5-DAFs > 2,3-DAFs.
A single Tg was found for any PVC-PLS
combination, indicating the miscibility in accordance with the homogeneity
on the material surface (seen from SEM analysis). A decent reduction
of Tg, from the original value of the
polymer matrix (∼82 °C), confirms a boost in flexibility.

Tensile testing provides information about the flexible nature
of the PVC-PLS films. One of the most important functions of the plasticizers
is to reduce the intermolecular attraction between chains of polymer,
which leads to flexibility in the processing of materials.48 Parameters like elastic modulus (E-modulus),
stress at break (so-called tensile strength, δ), and elongation
at break (ε) were under investigation and compared to PVC-DOP
films. Unplasticized PVC (uPVC) reportedly appears very hard and rigid
with a δ of 56.6 MPa, ε of 85%, and E-modulus of up to
3000 MPa (at 30 °C).49 Experimental
data (depicted in Figure 5) illustrate that all investigated plasticizers in the PVC
matrix showed desirable behavior. In detail, their tensile strengths
and elastic moduli were halved or much less than the ones of uPVC
with a δ of 8–20 MPa and E-modulus of 25–330 MPa,
respectively, while the strain at break (ε) was prolonged twice,
up to 200%. There was no noticeable difference in comparison between
DAFs versus DOP. As the amount of PLS in PVC increased (42.9 to 100phr),
the elastic modulus of the PVC-PLS films decreased (Figure 5a). A decrease in the stress
at break δ was presumable as well (Figure 5b) since, in principle, δ is proportionally
correlated with E-modulus. Rather, plasticizing efficiency of biobased
PLS was slightly better than that of DOP. Take 42.9phr plasticization
as an example. DOP’s E-modulus of 314.2 ± 6.6 MPa and
δ of 19.38 ± 0.92 MPa hardly surpassed the four remainders.
The ε values, on the contrary, were not dramatically changed
according to the amount and the kind of PLS, and they showed approximately
150–200% in the investigated range (Figure 5c). As a result, at a given plasticization
extent, the biobased furanic plasticizers were available to substitute
DOP in terms of tensile efficiency. The complete data is summarized
in Table S15.

modulus, (b) stress, and (c) elongation
at break according to the plasticizers contained in PVC-PLS films.

Migration Resistance and Thermostability
Pure polymer
itself is rigid, brittle, and hard for processing. When combined with
a plasticizer, flexibility, workability, and distensibility of the
material can be obtained.1 However, a significant
disadvantage is that the plasticizer and polymer matrix do not usually
form permanent linkages.3,50 This loose interaction
can fail to prevent PLS from migrating out of the matrix over time.
Therefore, under a suitable condition, the plasticizer can be released
from the matrix.50 Because of a need for
safe use in end products, the migration degree of PLS to the surrounding
environment should be determined. Two tests comprising volatility
(ASTM D1203-10) and extractability (ASTM D5227-13) were conducted
in this study. The former provides details about how much in quantity
the PLS could evaporate under an elevated condition without a suitable
heat stabilizer, and the latter reflects the leachable nature of PLS
into a (hot) surrounding liquid medium. After volatility tests, a
physical difference was not observed in PVC films when no heat stabilizer
was used.

A basic difference between DOP and DAFs comes from
the core in which furanic plasticizers have an oxygen atom capable
of boosting polarity, making DAFs more polarized. Figure 6b depicts results from the
extractability test in the hexane medium that all DAFs exhibited a
better resistance nature than DOP as expected. Also, the ortho-products (2,3-DBF/2,3-DIAF) performed better than the para-substituted ones. With regard to lyophilicity, hexane acts very
attractive to the less-polar migrants.51,52 Furthermore,
the boosted dynamicity and polarity led to an improved dipole moment,
together with a better attraction strength for the polymer matrix.
As observed, there was a correlation between the attraction and the
polarity (shown in Table 2).41 Accordingly, the Δν
difference of carbonyl absorption bands representing the attraction
strength from investigated compounds toward PVC was proportional to
the polarity that is expressed reversely in terms of the extraction
resistance. Providing the facts, PVC-DOP interaction is quantitized
by a 4 cm–1 difference via FTIR observation;39,40 in contrast, the effects caused by 2,5- and 2,3-DAFs generated 8–12
and 18–21 cm–1 shifts, respectively, to higher
frequencies. DOP turned out easier to be leached, while 2,3-DBF was
the most resistant among all. This reaffirmed that the greater the
polarity of a plasticizer molecule, the better the attraction it has
for the PVC chain, the less extractable content is migrated into hot
surrounding media.41,52,53 In brief, the extraction resistance followed the order of 2,3-DAFs
> 2,5-DAFs > DOP.

Due to their small structures, it is apparent that
furanic plasticizers
are more volatile than DOP. Their molecular weights are all below
300 g/mol indeed. The volatility of each furanic plasticizer can be
understood in the same way. The volatilities of 2,5-DBF/2,3-DBF having
butyl moieties were higher than those of 2,5-DIAF/2,3-DIAF having
isopentyl moieties (Figure 6a). To understand more about this behavior as well as the
thermal stability of the material, we performed thermogravimetry analysis
(TGA) in the absence of a suitable heat stabilizer. As can be seen
from Figure 7, TGA
curves for all the investigated PVC-PLS films have similarities. All
combinations came through three stages of thermal decomposition. The
first stage, near 205 °C, is mainly due to the release and evaporation
of the plasticizer. The next stage, up to 385 °C, is related
to the dehydrochlorination of PVC to form macromolecules with conjugated
bonds. In the last stage, up to 520 °C, newly formed macromolecules
undergo cracking and pyrolysis. Further information is presented in Tables S16–S19 in the Supporting Information.

thermograms (TGA curves) of 100phr PVC-PLS films containing
DOP, 2,5-DBF, 2,5-DIAF, 2,3-DBF, and 2,3-DIAF.

PVC is known as a nonvolatile material. Inside
the TGA chamber,
it is thermally degraded into two stages comprising dehydrochlorination
and pyrolysis.54,55 The introduction of the plasticizer,
on the one hand, helps the polymer to stay away from its rigid nature,
but on the other hand, it enhances the degree of volatility regarding
vapor pressure of the additive. This, in turn, is reflected by an
additional process prior to the actual two-stage thermal decomposition
of the matrix. Furthermore, it should be noted that the higher the
vapor pressure of a chemical, the faster the rate at which a material
loses weight and vice versa.41 Take 2,5-DBF
as an example. Its volatility, which was measured by about 12% according
to Figure 6a, allowed
its combination with PVC to lose 1/10 of its weight (at 250 °C)
faster than any others (Figure 7). In contrast, it was hard for DOP to do so because its T90% is only 9° different from the one of
pure PVC (being 286 °C). As a result, DOP was deemed more advanced
than the four investigated compounds.

Conclusions
Furan dicarboxylic acid derivatives were
successfully synthesized
by a one-pot multistep reaction between marine-biomass-originated
galactaric acid and bioalcohol. The reaction condition was adjusted
less vigorous, but milder and greener regarding reduction in the amount
of acid catalyst and addition of a material separation agent. The
unexpected detection of a 2-furoate product opened a chance of understanding
the reaction mechanism. After that, properties of four DAFs (namely,
2,5-DBF, 2,5-DIAF, 2,3-DBF, and 2,3-DIAF) as plasticizers on the PVC
matrix were investigated through various analytical techniques. As
an ultimate result, data interfered with one another to highlight
DAFs’ promising properties over DOP, except the volatility
and the low-temperature performance related to small molecular weight.
It was found in detail the compatibility through no phase separation,
the formation of intense interactive bonds related to carbonyl band
movement, the comparable flexibility, the higher polarity, and the
better extraction resistance to the surrounding liquid media. Meanwhile,
the volatile resistance and the thermal stability of the material
can be superior to DOP’s only if DAFs possess colossal molecular
weights,41,52 simply by prolonging the alkyl moieties.
