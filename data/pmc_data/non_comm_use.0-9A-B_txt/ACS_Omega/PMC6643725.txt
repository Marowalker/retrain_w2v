In situ Raman spectra of HoVO4 micro- and nanocrystals
were obtained at high pressures up to 25.4 and 18.0 GPa at room temperature,
respectively. The appearance of new peaks in the Raman spectra and
the discontinuities of the Raman-mode shift provided powerful evidence
for an irreversible zircon-to-scheelite structure transformation for
HoVO4 microcrystals at 7.2 GPa and for HoVO4 nanocrystals at 8.7 GPa. The lattice contraction caused by the size
effect was thought to be responsible for the different phase-transition
pressures. Also, the higher stability of HoVO4 nanocrystals
compared with the microcrystals was also confirmed using the Raman
frequencies and pressure coefficients. The results of the phase transition
of HoVO4 were compared with previously reported rare-earth
orthovanadates, and the phase diagram of REVO4 with RE
ionic radius at different pressures was presented.

Introduction
Rare-earth vanadates (REVO4) have numerous applications
such as catalysts, phosphors, polarizers, and laser materials because
of their excellent electric, optical, and magnetic properties. Recently,
synthesis and characterization of REVO4 nanomaterials have
been of considerable interest because of their novel size-dependent
properties.1−3 At the same time, high-pressure research on nanomaterials
has attracted much attention for the appearance of many novel high-pressure
behaviors in the nanomaterials. The size effect in high-pressure research
has attracted great interest considering that the grain size can significantly
influence the phase-transition pressure of many materials.4 So far, many nanomaterials have been studied,
such as CdSe,5 PbS,6 ZnS,7 Y2O3,8 Mn3O4,9 TiO2,10 and SnO2.11 These works showed that the
grain size at the nanoscale level can distinctly influence the material
properties under high pressure. Therefore, high-pressure study of
the size-dependent structural stability of REVO4 is also
considered important. Among all of the rare-earth vanadates, only
LaVO4 nanocrystals were studied under high pressure in
previous reports.12 Unfortunately, the
high-pressure research of bulk LaVO4 has not been conducted.
It means that there is not even one rare-earth vanadate where high-pressure
experiment was conducted for nanomaterials and bulk materials under
the same conditions.

HoVO4, as a typical rare-earth
vanadate, has some excellent
properties compared with other REVO4 materials, such as
the best catalytic performance for the oxidative dehydrogenation of
ethane. Although a number of studies about REVO4 under
high pressure have been reported,13−17 there are a few reports on the high-pressure study
of HoVO4, specifically size-dependent HoVO4.
High-pressure XRD experiments on HoVO4 were conducted by
Garg et al. at pressures up to 28 GPa, and the zircon–scheelite
transition phase-transition pressure was found to be located at 4.5
and 8.2 GPa under nonhydrostatic and quasi-hydrostatic conditions,
respectively.14 In their experiments, Ar
and a methanol–ethanol (4:1) mixture were used as pressure-transmitting
medium (PTM) to obtain quasi-hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic pressures,
respectively. The high-pressure Raman spectra of bulk HoVO4 were studied by Chen et al., and a zircon–scheelite transition
at 9.3 GPa was observed, although their experiment was conducted without
any PTM. However, they did not conduct the size-dependent high-pressure
research on HoVO4.

Most REVO4 crystals
exist in the zircon-type structure
(space group I41/amd)
under ambient conditions and undergo a phase transition to the scheelite-type
structure (space group I41/a) under compression.18 However, there
are also a few REVO4 compounds, like CeVO4,19 that undergo a direct zircon-to-monazite phase
transition under high pressures.

Therefore, to better understand
the size-dependent structural stability
of REVO4 and also the high-pressure properties of HoVO4, the present work aims at the in situ Raman spectroscopy
study of HoVO4 micro- and nanocrystals under high pressures
at room temperature. The irreversible phase transition is found for
HoVO4 crystals under high pressures. On the basis of this,
we further explore the common rule for phase transformation of all
rare-earth vanadates.

Results and Discussion
Structure of HoVO4
The XRD diffraction patterns
of the synthesized HoVO4 micro- and nanocrystals are shown
in Figure 1. All of
these diffraction peaks of the micro- and nanocrystals agree with
the JCPDS card 15-0764; the result indicates that pure zircon-type
micro- and nanocrystalline HoVO4 structures were obtained.
Compared with the microcrystal data, the diffraction peaks of nanocrystals
were apparently broadened because of the finite size of the crystallites,
which is known as Debye–Scherrer broadening. The XRD patterns
of these two samples were well refined by Rietveld analysis as the
red lines in Figure 1 show. The well-fitted XRD patterns demonstrated that the prepared
HoVO4 crystallizes in a triclinic structure with the space
group I4 1/amd without impurity.
Crystal unit-cell parameters were calculated by the Rietveld method
using the MAUD software. The unit-cell parameters of the microcrystals
(a = 7.110 Å, b = 7.110 Å,
and c = 6.281 Å) and nanocrystals (a = 7.110 Å, b = 7.110 Å, and c = 6.264 Å) in this work are very similar with the bulk HoVO4 data (a = 7.121 Å, b = 7.121 Å, and c = 6.293 Å) obtained
from references. The refined crystallographic data clearly indicate
a reduction in the lattice parameters with a decreased crystal size,
especially in the direction of the crystallographic axis c. For nanocrystals, there exists an extra pressure caused by the
surface tension at the crystallite surface. For a sphere-shaped particle
with a radius of r, the pressure intensity distribution
on the particle is linearly associated with 1/r and
is indirectly proportional to the surface-to-volume ratio. Considering
this, the extra pressure caused by the surface tension exerted on
a smaller grain is apparently higher than that of the pressure exerted
on a larger one. Therefore, a distinct lattice contraction occurs
when the crystallite size decrease from microscale to nanoscale. Figure 2a,b shows the SEM
image of the HoVO4 microcrystals and the TEM image of the
HoVO4 nanocrystals, respectively. The microcrystals have
a length of ∼1 μm and a width of ∼300 nm, and
the nanocrystals have a diameter of ∼20 nm.

micro- and nanocrystalline HoVO4.

Raman Modes of HoVO4 under Ambient Conditions
Under ambient conditions, HoVO4 cystallizes in the zircon-type
structure just like many other REVO4 materials. Group theoretical
calculations predicted that there are 12 first-order Raman modes in
the Brillouin zone center with symmetries:20 1  

The Raman spectra of
micro- and nanocrystalline HoVO4 in the zircon-type phase
under ambient conditions were collected and displayed at the bottom
of Figures 3 and 4, respectively. In our experiment,
only 8 of 12 Raman active modes are clearly discernible under ambient
conditions, which agree well with the previous report.20 Among them, the Raman modes located in the range
of 260–900 cm–1 are internal modes (ν1 to ν4) attributed to the antisymmetric stretching
vibrations of the V–O bond within the VO4 tetrahedra,
and the modes located in the range of 100–260 cm–1 are external modes (T and R).
The Raman active modes of HoVO4 microcrystals and nanocrystals
under ambient conditions with the corresponding mode assignments from
ref (20) are listed
in Table 1. The corresponding
data of single crystals are also shown in Table 1 for comparison. It can be clearly seen that
almost all Raman frequencies of nanocrystals HoVO4 are
a little bit higher than those of the microcrystals. This can be understood
by considering the influence of crystalline grain size on the force
constants of the nearest-neighbor bonds.21,22 When the grain size of HoVO4 decreased to the nanometer
scale, the higher surface energy led to a volume contraction within
the nanoparticles. Afterward, the force constants increased while
the interatomic distances decreased. As a consequence, the Raman modes
shift toward a higher frequency.

Pressure Effects
on Microcrystalline HoVO4
Figure 3 shows the
Raman spectra of microcrystalline HoVO4 under high pressure
up to 25.4 GPa at room temperature. Below 7.2 GPa, all Raman peaks
can be identified with the HoVO4 zircon-type structure
except the signals of silicon oil, and the pressure coefficient of
each Raman mode calculated by using a linear fit is listed in Table 1. No significant change
in the Raman pattern occurred during this compression process, but
most Raman peaks shifted toward higher frequencies with increased
pressure, except the internal ν2(B2g)
mode at 261 cm–1 and the external T(Eg) mode at 156 cm–1. The softening of these two
modes, which was caused by orthorhombic distortions in the basal plane
and monoclinic distortions in the a–c or b–c planes,
respectively,23 was also observed in many
other REVO4 materials under high pressure.12,18,19,24−26 It should be noted that they are not classical soft
modes, of which the frequency usually approaches zero accompanied
by some specific kind of phase transition. The results obtained from
TmPO4, which also has a zircon-type structure, indicated
that the classical soft mode can be assigned to the R(B1u) mode. Further, the lattice-dynamics calculations showed that this
silent mode is caused by the rotation of the rigid PO4 tetrahedra.27

When the pressure was increased to 7.2
GPa, some remarkable changes occurred in the Raman pattern. Several
new peaks appeared at frequencies of 142, 190, and 372 cm–1, which can be assigned to the T(Bg), T(Eg),
and ν2(Bg) modes of a scheelite-type structure,
respectively. The intensity of these new Raman peaks increased gradually
with increasing pressure, whereas the characteristic peaks of the
zircon-type HoVO4 became more and more indistinct. These
variations shown on the Raman pattern of HoVO4 microcrystals
confirmed a pressure-induced structure transformation from zircon-type
to scheelite-type, which was similar to the phenomenon observed in
YVO4,28 ScVO4,18 GdVO4,29 and LuVO4.30 In the unit cell
of the scheelite structure of HoVO4, including four formula
units, the V atoms occupy S4 sites of the VO4 group. Under the C4h point group corresponding to Γ, the factor group analysis
predicts that there are 13 zone-center Raman active modes:31,32 2  

In this work, we displayed only six modes considering that
the
remaining Raman modes are too weak to distinguish because of the broadening
and degeneracy of Raman peaks under high pressure. The pressure dependences
of the Raman frequencies of HoVO4 microcrystals are plotted
and linear-fitted in Figure 5. Also, the discontinuities of the Raman frequencies with
increased pressure can be easily distinguished at 7.2 GPa, which means
that a pressure-induced structure transformation starts at this pressure.
The Raman frequencies and their pressure coefficients calculated by
using linear fit are listed in Table 2.

After releasing the pressure under ambient conditions,
the Raman
spectra collected after decompression cannot be assigned to zircon-type.
However, they cannot be assigned to the scheelite phase as well. Considering
this, we believe that a third polymorph or a mixture of phases is
obtained after decompression. This behavior has also been found in
ScVO4 and GdVO4.33,34 Thus, it can
be concluded that at room temperature, HoVO4 microcrystals
undergo an irreversible zircon-to-scheelite structure transformation
at a pressure of 7.2 GPa. After decompression, a third polymorph or
a mixture of phases is obtained.

Pressure Effects on Nanocrystalline
HoVO4
Figure 4 shows the
in situ Raman spectra of HoVO4 nanocrystals with increasing
pressure at room temperature. The Raman shifts for the peaks of nanocrystalline
HoVO4 under pressure are similar to those of microcrystalline
HoVO4. All peaks can be identified as zircon-type structures
below 8.7 GPa. Also, the pressure coefficients of the zircon-type
Raman modes were calculated by linear fits, which are shown and presented
in Figure 6 and Table 1. At 8.7 GPa, two
new broad and weak peaks were observed at 145 and 379 cm–1, which can be assigned to the T(Bg) and ν2(Bg) modes of scheelite-type structure, respectively.
Another new Raman peak at 202 cm–1 that can be assigned
to the T(Eg) mode of scheelite-type appeared when the pressure
was increased to 11.7 GPa. The intensity of these new Raman peaks
all became stronger gradually with increasing pressure, whereas the
zircon-type Raman peaks lose their intensity slowly and became indistinct
and broad. The pressure dependences of the Raman frequencies of HoVO4 nanocrystals are plotted in Figure 6. The discontinuities of Raman frequencies
with increasing pressure indicated a clearly pressure-induced structure
transformation at 8.7 GPa. The Raman frequencies with their mode assignments
and pressure coefficients of scheelite-type HoVO4 are listed
in Table 2.

Figure 6 Pressure dependence
of the shifts of Raman active modes for nanocrystalline
HoVO4.

When the pressure was
released under ambient conditions, the Raman
frequencies were consistent with those of the scheelite-structure
HoVO4, which emerged under high pressure. Thus, the structure
transformation of HoVO4 nanocrystals is also irreversible.
In conclusion, HoVO4 nanocrystals undergo an irreversible
zircon-to-scheelite structure transformation at a pressure of 8.7
GPa at normal temperature, which is similar to the pressure-induced
structure transformation observed in HoVO4 nanocrystals.
A third polymorph or a mixture of phases is obtained after decompression.

Size-Dependent Phase-Transition Pressures of HoVO4
After studying the high-pressure properties of the micro-
and nanocrystalline HoVO4, we compared our results with
the previous experiments conducted on bulk HoVO4. In the
experiment conducted by Garg et al., the irreversible zircon–scheelite
transition was found at 4.5 and 8.2 GPa under nonhydrostatic and quasi-hydrostatic
conditions, respectively.14 The phase-transition
pressure of microcrystalline and nanocrystalline HoVO4 obtained
in this work is 7.2 and 8.7 GPa, respectively, which is closer to
the results obtained under the quasi-hydrostatic conditions. It should
be pointed out that the difference in crystal size, measurement methods
(XRD or Raman), and pressure-transmission medium can all influence
the final phase-transition pressure. Considering this, the difference
in the phase-transition medium can be understood. Chen et al. conducted
Ramman measurements on bulk HoVO4 and found that the zircon–scheelite
transition occurred at 9.3 GPa.35 Their
results are not far from the phase-transition pressure obtained in
this work. However, they did not use any PTM in their experiments.
In that case, the phase-transition pressure should be treated with
caution.

According to the results of the above experiments,
it is clear that HoVO4 nanocrystals possess a higher phase-transition
pressure compared with the microcrystals. To understand this, it is
worth noting that Table 1 indicates that not only almost all of the Raman frequencies but
also all of the pressure coefficients of nanocrytals are higher than
those of the microcrystals. It is safe to say that the strength of
most bonds of HoVO4 is increased when the crystalline grain
size is decreased from the micrometer to nanometer scale. Generally,
when the particle size decreased, the size-induced radial pressure
leads to the decrease in lattice constant.36 Apparently, HoVO4 crystals comply with this rule. This
has been confirmed from the higher Raman frequencies of nanocrystals,
as compared with the HoVO4 microcrystals described above.
Thus, the structural stability is increased, resulting in a higher
phase-transition pressure.

RE Ionic Radius-Dependent Phase Transition
of REVO4
It is known that many REVO4 undergo a phase
transition from zircon-type to scheelite-type under low GPa such as
HoVO4, GaVO4, and so on, while a few of them
transform into monazite-type such as LaVO4 and CeVO4. To explore the influence factor behind this phenomenon,
we summarized the phase-transition direction and pressures of different
REVO4 materials with their RE ionic radius as shown in Table 3. Considering that
the properties of microcrystals are very close to those of bulk materials,
we listed them in one row in Table 3. We noted that when the RE ionic radius is below 0.97
Å, the corresponding REVO4 would likely undergo a
phase transition from zircon-type to scheelite-type; otherwise, it
will transform into monazite-type. This is an interesting conclusion,
which has not been straightforwardly proposed in previous reports
as far as we know. Furthermore, phase-transition pressures of all
these REVO4 materials as a function of RE ionic radius
are shown in Figure 7. It is clear that the lower the RE ionic radius is, the higher the
phase transition pressure. Whether it was a phase transition into
scheelite or monazite, both apply to this conclusion. The relationship
between phase-transition pressure and RE ionic radius can be described
approximately by this formula: 3

Combined with this
fit result, we can draw the phase diagram of
REVO4 at different pressures and with different RE ionic
radii as seen in Figure 7. The zircon phase is more stable in REVO4 with a small
RE ionic radius. When the pressure is below the line of eq 3, REVO4 tends to exist
in zircon-type. After increasing the pressure, REVO4 would
transform into scheelite-type if it has a small RE ionic radius and,
otherwise, to monazite-type. The boundary is located at 0.97 ±
0.01 Å. According to eq 3, TmVO4 is predicted to undergo zircon-to-scheelite
phase transitions at about 7.8 GPa. Previously, our prediction for
the phase transition of ErVO4 has been proved by a very
recent work published by Javier et al.37 The phase-transition pressure of PmVO4 are predicted
to be around 6.5 GPa, whereas the transition direction is not sure
because it is just located at the critical point of scheelite and
monazite phase.

Conclusions
The high-pressure Raman
spectra of micro- and nanocrystalline HoVO4 were obtained
at room temperature. The appearance of new
peaks in the Raman spectra and the discontinuities of the Raman-mode
shift provided powerful evidence for an irreversible zircon-to-scheelite
structure transformation for HoVO4 microcrystals at 7.2
GPa and for HoVO4 nanocrystals at 8.7 GPa, which indicates
that the phase-transition pressure of HoVO4 increases with
the reducing particle size. The higher stability of nanocrystals of
HoVO4 was confirmed by the higher Raman frequencies and
pressure coefficients compared with the nanocrystals. Combined with
the high-pressure study on EuVO4, we infer that the phase-transition
pressure of other REVO4 micro- and nanocrystals should
also comply with this rule. Additionally, we summarized previous work
on high-pressure study on REVO4 and obtained a high-pressure
phase diagram of REVO4 with RE ionic radius. According
to this phase diagram, the high-pressure properties of ErVO4, TmVO4, and PmVO4 were predicted. Among which,
the predictions for ErVO4 are in excellent agreement with
the recently published work on high-pressure XRD experiments.

Experimental
Section
The micro- and nanocrystalline HoVO4 materials
were
prepared by a hydrothermal method based on the previous literature.38,39 For example, in the synthesis procedure of nanocrystalline HoVO4, first, 0.28 mmol of Ho2O3 was dissolved
in 10.0 mL of 1 mol/L HNO3. Ho(NO3)3 crystals were produced after the excess HNO3 was removed.
Then, 30 mL water was added to dissolve the Ho(NO3)3 crystals. Afterward, a homogeneous Na3VO4 aqueous solution produced by mixing 0.28 mmol of V2O5 powders with dilute NaOH solution was dropwise added into
the Ho(NO3)3 solution. After quickly stirring
for 10 min, the homogeneous mixture was poured into a 50 mL Teflon-lined
autoclave. Then, the autoclave was sealed up and treated at 200 °C
for 24 h. Afterward, the precipitates were collected after centrifugation
at 3500 rpm for 15 min and washed with ethanol and deionized water.
Finally, the product was obtained.

The crystal structures of
the samples were identified by X-ray
diffraction apparatus (TTRAX3) with Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 1.542 Å). The grain size of the samples was surveyed using
a scanning electron microscope (JSM-6700F) and transmission electron
microscope (JEOL-2010). A diamond anvil cell (DAC) with a stainless
steel gasket was used to generate high pressure. A circular hole with
a diameter of 160 μm was drilled into the gasket center by a
spark driller, which was used to place the sample. The pressure was
determined by the widely adopted ruby fluorescence method.40 To avoid uneven pressure within the sample,
silicon oil was used as the pressure-transmitting medium.41 It should be stated that silicon oil is known
not to be quasi-hydrostatic beyond 10 GPa.42 Klotz et al. indicated that pressure differences increase with pressures
up to 6 GPa. However, this pressure difference was smaller than 0.4
GPa when the pressure was below 12 GPa. The traditional pressure-transmitting
media, a methanol–ethanol mixture and a methanol–ethanol–water
mixture, will lead to changes of the Raman modes of HoVO4. The silicon oil has no influence on the Raman signal of the samples,
so it was employed as the pressure-transmitting medium. In situ Raman
signals were collected by a confocal microscope Raman spectrometer
system (Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR), which is equipped with a multichannel
air-cooled CCD detector and a stigmatic spectrometer, excited by a
514.5 nm Ar+ laser with an incident power of 5.4 mW, and
all Raman spectra were collected in the reflection geometry at normal
temperature. The resolution of the applied Raman system is 2 cm–1.
