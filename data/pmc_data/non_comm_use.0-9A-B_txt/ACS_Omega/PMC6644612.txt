Skeletal isomerization of n-butene to isobutene
was performed over formed ZSM-35 zeolites in a lab-scale, fixed-bed
reactor. The formation conditions to produce isobutene with zeolites
were varied to determine the most advantageous binding agent (pseudo-boehmite)
amount and steam dealumination conditions. The optimal binding agent
amount was 20 wt %. Steam dealumination stabilized the catalysts and
enhanced the catalytic performance because of the stable Si/Al framework
and suitable acidity. The optimized process conditions involved a
reaction temperature of 410 °C, a weight hourly space velocity
of 5 h–1, and an n-butene concentration
in feedstock of 50%. After being on-stream for 296 h, the catalysts
were stable and were able to be regenerated with a comparable catalytic
performance. An isobutene yield of 33–43 wt % was achieved,
and the selectivity of isobutene was higher than 90% after the reaction
was carried out for longer than 15 h. Carbon deposition modified the
pore structure to enhance the selectivity of isobutene because of
the selective shape effect. This study shows promising results for
future industrialization of the skeletal isomerization of n-butene to isobutene in the presence of optimized ZSM-35
catalysts.

==== Body
Introduction
Isobutene is an important
organic chemical material used in the
production of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), tertiary butanol,
methyl methacrylate, butyl rubber, and other highly valued chemicals.1,2 Currently, the major conversion pathways for the production of isobutene
include the skeletal isomerization of n-butene, dehydrogenation
of isobutane, and isomerization dehydrogenation of n-butane.3 The skeletal isomerization of n-butene has obtained increased attention to produce MTBE
and other highly valued products. This technology also enhances the
utilization of C4 and increases the supply of isobutene. The skeletal
isomerization of n-butene is dependent on the acid
catalysis technology. Researchers have developed Al2O3-based catalysts and various types of zeolites used in the
skeletal isomerization of n-butene.3,4 Al2O3-based catalysts have been applied in
the early stage of isomerization; however, this technology has been
gradually replaced because of low catalytic activity and poor stability.
Ferrierite5 has been heavily researched
and utilized because of the special pore structure and size to selectively
produce isobutene. In addition, ferrierite is becoming an attractive
catalyst to use in the industry because of its strong carbon tolerance.4 Ferrierite catalysis occurs over a lifetime of
hundreds of hours, and this type of material is included but not limited
to SAPO-11, MCM-22/49, ZSM-5, ZSM-35, and ZSM-22/23.4−7 Promising catalytic activity has been achieved, especially with
the ten-membered ring (MR) zeolite ZSM-35.8,9

Properties such as acid strength (weak and strong), Brønsted
(B) or Lewis (L) acid type, and active site distribution have a serious
effect on the catalytic performance of the zeolite.10−13 The acid strength required for
acid-catalyzed isomerization reactions can be ranked as the following:
cracking ≈ oligomerization > skeletal isomerization >
double-bond
shift and cis–trans isomerism.5,14,15 Moreover, the isolated acid sites reduce the number
of side reactions.16−18 The acidity of zeolites can be adjusted by changing
the Si/Al ratio, replacing alumina in the framework with other elements,
or modifying the preparation/forming process.

Carbon deposition
is an inevitable process in the skeletal isomerization
of n-butene to isobutene. A small amount of carbon
deposition enhances the selectivity, but too much carbon deposition
leads to the deactivation of the catalysts.19−22 Wattanakit et al.23 studied the effects of various reaction times
on carbon deposition. The carbon mainly blocked the 8-MR pore channel,
but only a small amount of carbon was deposited on the 10-MR pore
channel in the initial stage of the reaction. As the reaction continued,
the 8-MR pore channel was blocked completely, whereas the 10-MR pore
channel only had a slight amount of carbon deposition. Therefore,
the catalyst could retain a high catalytic performance over a long
period of time. The proper reactor type and reaction conditions reduce
coke deposition on the catalyst. Modification of the catalyst components
or structure also has the potential to reduce coking. Regeneration
of catalysts can enhance the comprehensive economic benefits of industrial
catalytic devices, reduce the consumption of catalysts, and protect
the environment. The regeneration approach relates to deactivation
reasons. Carbon deposition involves the physical coverage of the catalyst
without any destruction of the structure of the catalysts. Therefore,
combustion of the carbon on the catalyst or steam regeneration can
be used to remove carbon deposition.21,24

Although
ZSM-35 has been applied as an isomerization catalyst,
there is not a well-defined relationship between the catalytic performance
and the active sites on the zeolite. There is also not a well-defined
relationship between carbon deposition and catalyst stability because
of limited characterization technologies. The objective of this study
was to optimize the forming process to prepare superior catalysts
in terms of the pseudo-boehmite binder amount and steam dealumination.
This study also seeks to determine the reaction process conditions
most conducive to maximize isobutene yield in terms of the reaction
temperature, feedstock concentration, and weight hourly space velocity
(WHSV). Furthermore, coke deposition and catalyst regeneration were
also investigated.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of the
Synthesized ZSM-35 Zeolite Powder
Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images (Figure 1a) clearly showed that the synthesized ZSM-35
zeolite powder were present as rectangular shapes and had a sheetlike
morphology. The particle size was relatively uniform. The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) pattern of the synthesized ZSM-35 zeolite (Figure 1b) only had characteristic
diffraction peaks at 2θ = 9.4°, 22.4°, 22.7°,
23.3°, 23.7°, 24.5°, and 25.3°, indicating that
the synthesized ZSM-35 zeolites were well-crystallized and pure.7 The surface area and pore volume measured by
N2 adsorption–desorption (Table 1) revealed that the synthesized ZSM-35 zeolite
possessed a large surface area of 327.5 m2/g, and the pore
volume was 0.157 mL/g. These results can be attributed to the small
zeolite grains that were well-crystallized. The acid strength and
type of the synthesized ZSM-35 zeolite were analyzed by temperature-programmed
desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) and Py-infrared (IR), respectively.
NH3-TPD profiles (Figure 1c) indicated that the synthesized ZSM-35 had two acid
types, namely weak acid and strong acid, located at 100–200
and 300–500 °C, respectively. Py-IR spectra of pyridine
adsorption at 200 and 350 °C (Figure 1d) inferred that the synthesized zeolite
had a large amount of Brønsted acidic sites (B) and a small amount
of Lewis acidic sites (L) located at 1540 and 1450 cm–1, respectively (Table 2).

Optimization of the Forming Process for ZSM-35
Catalysts
The forming of the catalysts is important for catalytic
performance
and for the stability of the catalysts in the industry. In this study,
the amount of the pseudo-boehmite binder and the steam dealumination
were selected to be studied. All catalytic reactions in the formation
were performed under reaction conditions, T = 410
°C, P = 0.1 MPa, WGSH = 5 h–1, and n-butene concentration = 50%. Details of the
feedstock components are listed in Table S1.

Effects of the Pseudo-Boehmite
Binder Amount on the Formed ZSM-35
Catalysts
The binder was applied to increase the bond strength
between material particles to improve adhesion. In this study, pseudo-boehmite
was chosen as the binder to investigate the shaped catalysts’
strength and catalytic performance. The results (Table 3) showed that the crushing strength
of the catalyst increased as the binder amount increased from 0 to
40 wt %. NH3-TPD profiles (Figure 2a) indicated that the catalysts had an increase
in acidity as the binder amount increased from 0 to 20 wt %. However,
when the binder amount increased from 20 to 40 wt %, the desorption
peak area showed a reverse effect and the weak acidic sites decreased
to an amount even lower than that of the Cat.-0. The reason for the
decreased acidity was attributed to surface hydroxyl condensation,
which took place during the molding and calcination processes. Py-IR
spectroscopy (Figure 2b and Table 4) inferred
that the total Lewis acidic sites (L) located at 1450 cm–1 increased from 0.1 to 0.45 μmol/g as the binder percentage
increased from 0 to 40 wt %. However, Brønsted acidic sites (B)
located at 1540 cm–1 exhibited the opposite tendency
and decreased as the binder amount increased, as shown in Table 4. The L/B ratios at
weak and strong acidic sites increased as the binder amount increased.

Catalytic performance results (Figure 2c,d) indicated that the conversion of n-butene and the yield of isobutene increased as the binder
amount increased from 0 to 20 wt %. However, the continuous increase
of the binder amount to 40 wt % led to the decrease of n-butene conversion and isobutene yield. This result is consistent
with the NH3-TPD and Py-IR results, indicating that the
conversion of n-butene was related to the acidity
of the catalyst. The selectivity of isobutene increased as the amount
of binder increased from 0 to 40 wt %. This may have occurred because
Al2O3 deposited on the inner pores of the structured
zeolites decreased the size of the channels, which favored a single
molecule reaction. Therefore, the optimal binder amount was 20 wt
% to generate isobutene.

Effect of Steam Dealumination on Formed ZSM-35
Catalysts
Hydrothermal treatment is an effective approach
to enhance the stability
of the catalyst and the selectivity of the desired products by adjusting
the acidity and structure of the catalyst.26 In this study, the formed ZSM-35 with 20 wt % pseudo-boehmite binder
was selected for hydrothermal treatment. NH3-TPD profiles
(Figure 3a) indicated
that the weak acidic site amount did not change, whereas the strong
acidic sites decreased slightly. However, the Py-IR spectra (Figure 3b and Table 5) inferred that the B acid type
amount decreased substantially after hydrothermal treatment, whereas
the L acid type amount increased largely. The solid-state nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra 29Si of the hydrothermal
and nonhydrothermal treatment are shown in Figure 3c. The shift of −100.2419 ppm was
assigned to Q(2Al); the shift of −105.3952 and −108.6855
ppm were assigned to Q(1Al); the shift of −112.0363, −114.7540,
and −116.4758 ppm were characterized as Q(0Al).26,27 The calculated framework Si/Al molar ratio for the nonhydrothermal
and hydrothermal treated catalysts were 56.50 and 84.90 using the
following equation, respectively, indicating that the framework Al
atoms were partly removed. The removed framework Al atoms were responsible
for the decreased B acid type amount and the increased L/B ratio,
which was consistent with the reported work.27

The catalytic performance results (Figure 3d,e) indicated that the conversion
of n-butene in the presence of hydrothermal-treated
catalysts
was always higher than that of the fresh catalysts during the isomerization
reaction. The hydrothermal-treated catalysts showed less isobutene
selectivity in the first 40 h but reached the same level in the later
60 h. Moreover, the hydrothermal-treated catalyst showed only a slightly
lower yield of isobutene during the first 20 h; however, it had a
higher and stable isobutene yield after 40 h. These results implied
that the hydrothermal treatment enhanced the stability of the zeolite
by removing the active sites responsible for catalyzing oligomerization
and cracking reactions.5,28 The decreased strong acidic sites
in NH3-TPD results supported this conclusion, which led
to coking and catalyst deactivation. The slight increased yield of
propene was possibly due to the increased L acidic type, which was
the active site for catalytic cracking. Another reason was possibly
because the secondary pore was formed during hydrothermal treatment,
which was beneficial for molecular diffusion and cracking of low polyolefin.

Optimization of Skeletal Isomerization Process Conditions
The process conditions such as the reaction temperature, n-butene concentration, and WHSV have significant effects
on the isomerization process.29 Therefore,
these three parameters have been systematically investigated in this
work. Reaction temperature studies (Figure 4a,b) indicated that the conversion of n-butene, the selectivity of isobutene, and the yield of
isobutene all increased as the reaction temperature increased from
350 to 410 °C. However, the conversion of n-butene
decreased, whereas the selectivity and yield of isobutene increased
slightly when the temperature was continuously increased to 450 °C.
The yield of heavy components (C5+) increased
slightly and that of propene substantially increased as the temperature
increased from 350 to 450 °C. The decrease of n-butene conversion was probably due to side reactions that occurred,
involving cracking and coking of polymerized products at high reaction
temperatures. The selectivity of isobutene increased because of the
channel modification from carbon deposition and the interaction between
kinetics and thermodynamics.29,30 Considering the catalyst
stability and low byproduct production, the optimal temperature for
the isomerization reaction was 410 °C.

Figure 4 (a,b) Effect of reaction
temperatures on the catalytic activity
(reaction conditions: n-butene concentration = 50%,
pressure = 0.1 MPa, and WHSV = 5 h–1), (c,d) effect
of n-butene concentration on the catalytic activity
(reaction conditions: T = 410 °C, pressure =
0.1 MPa, and WHSV = 5 h–1), and (e–g) effect
of WHSV on the catalytic activity (reaction conditions: n-butene concentration = 50%, pressure = 0.1 MPa, and T = 410 °C). The detailed component concentration in the feedstock
is listed in Table S1.

The n-butene concentration study (Figure 4c,d) inferred that
the conversion
of n-butene and the yield of isobutene decreased
even though the selectivity increased slightly as the n-butene concentration increased. The yield of C5+ increased, but the yield of propene decreased. The high concentration
of the precursor feedstock increased the partial pressure of n-butene, which was beneficial for the oligomerization of
olefins; however, the increased concentration decreased the contact
frequency between n-butene and the active sites on
the catalyst, which resulted in an insufficient reaction. Generally,
the initial reaction stage involved the bimolecular mechanism.8 As the concentration of n-butene
increased, the yield of C5+ increased because
the less contact frequency increased the amount of unreacted biopolymers.
Moreover, the higher n-butene concentration was beneficial
for dimerization to produce more carbon, which modified the pore channel
by covering the strong acid sites; therefore, the selectivity of isobutene
increased. The catalysts have great adaptability to the concentration
range of n-butylene; however, an extremely high concentration
of n-butene resulted in a high yield of byproducts
and rapid carbon deposition. Therefore, low concentrations of n-butene were most beneficial for favoring the isomerization
reactions.

Generally, when the amount of catalyst loading is
fixed, the device-processing
capacity increased, but the contact time of raw material and catalyst
was shortened with the increase of WHSV, which led to a decreased
conversion degree of the raw material and the yield of isobutylene.
On the contrary, the contact time of the material and the catalyst
was prolonged, but the byproduct increased and the selectivity of
isobutene decreased with the decrease of WHSV. The n-butene conversion and yield of isobutene decreased with the increase
of WHSV. The reason for this was because the contact efficiency between n-butene and the catalyst active sites decreased as the
WHSV increased. In addition, the short contact time decreased the
possibility of occurrence of polymerization reactions.31 Therefore, although the conversion of n-butylene and the yield of isobutylene are high when the
WHSV is low, considering the selectivity and process capacity of isobutylene,
the optimal WHSV condition for the skeletal isomerization of n-butene was 5 h–1 (Figure 4e–g).

Stability and Regeneration
of ZSM-35 Catalysts
The
stability of the catalyst is a key factor for industrialization. Carbon
deposition inactivation is an inevitable process, and the carbon type
determined the regeneration process used on catalysts, which already
underwent the reaction. During the initial reaction time of 20 h,
the conversion of n-butene decreased rapidly from
60 to 45%, whereas the selectivity of isobutene increased from 55
to 90% (Figure 5a–c).
This initial phenomenon matched the reported bimolecular mechanism,
namely, the initial polymerized byproducts were deposited inside the
pore channel. These byproducts covered the strong acid sites and modified
the channels to increase the selectivity of isobutene. Therefore,
the deposition of carbon played a vital role in shape-selective catalysis.32 As the reaction time on-stream continued, the
conversion of n-butene, the selectivity of isobutene,
and the yield of isobutene tended to be stable but slightly decreased
over time. A yield of isobutene at 33–43 wt % was achieved,
and the selectivity of isobutene was higher than 90% after the reaction
was carried out for longer than 15 h, indicating that the ZSM-35 catalyst
had excellent stability. These results are comparable to the industrialized
skeletal isomerization to isobutene with an isobutene yield of 28.35–47.5
wt % in the presence of various types of catalysts.5,33,34 In addition, for long-time running of 30
days, the catalyst synthesized under optimal conditions exhibited
a slightly higher yield of isobutene than the commercial catalyst
purchased from Langdale, as shown in Table S2.

Py-IR profiles of fresh and regenerated catalyst desorption at the
temperature of 250 °C.

Compared to the fresh catalysts, the regenerated catalysts
showed
slightly lower n-butene conversion in the initial
50 h but a similar conversion as the reaction progressed over time.
Isobutene selectivity and yield of the regenerated catalysts were
slightly lower than those of fresh catalysts, whereas the propene
yield only varied slightly during the initial reaction. These catalytic
performances suggested that the regenerated catalysts did not recover
completely, but their performances were like those of the fresh catalysts,
indicating that the regeneration process was effective. During the
first 50 h, the conversion and selectivity differed significantly
because of the remaining carbon, altered pore structure, and new acidity
level in the regenerated catalysts. This was verified by the following:
temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), NH3-TPD, N2 adsorption–desorption, and Py-IR characterization.

TPO results (Figure 5d) showed that the fresh catalyst only exhibited a small deposition
peak located at 210 °C assigned to the surface-adsorbed CO2. The regenerated catalyst had only one weak peak centered
at 670 °C because of a small amount of unburned carbon. Used
catalysts-6 and used catalyst-200 obtained at respective reaction
times of 6 and 200 h had two peaks centered at 460 and 670 °C,
indicating that there were two types of deposited carbons. Moreover,
the carbon deposition increased substantially with the increase of
the reaction time, indicating that the deactivation of the catalysts
resulting from the carbon deposition was inevitable.34 It is known that the higher the degree of graphitization,
the higher the ratio of C/H, and the more difficult it is to remove
the material.35 Therefore, the peak at
460 °C resulted from the adsorbed hydrocarbons and the carbon
deposited on the catalyst surface area, whereas the peak at 670 °C
was from the high polymer carbon (graphitelike structure). The similar
peak areas at 670 °C for used catalyst-6 and used catalyst-200
and the much larger peak area at 470 °C for used catalyst-200
suggested that the high polymer carbon (graphitelike structure) was
formed at the initial stage of the reaction, whereas the lower polymer
carbon was produced as the reaction time increased. The remaining
carbon or the interaction between the carbon and the zeolite may be
one of the reasons for the improved selectivity.

N2 adsorption–desorption analysis results listed
in Table 6 show that
the surface area for used catalyst-6 and used catalyst-200 decreased
dramatically and the pore size increased largely compared to the fresh
catalyst. The longer the reaction time, the more obvious change of
the surface area and the pore structure. The surface area decrease
could be due to the blockage of the small size pores, indicating that
the carbon deposition occurred within the 8-rings, followed by the
10-rings. Moreover, the deposited carbon may have formed macromolecular
substances, which resulted in the increase of the pore size.36 The decreased surface area and the enlarged
pore size in the regenerated catalyst further demonstrated that the
catalysts have not been entirely rejuvenated, which further proved
that the carbon deposition in the initial stage of the reaction cannot
be combusted completely because of the higher polymerization degree
and the larger graphitization degree.24 These results agreed with the TPO analysis results.

NH3-TPD analysis results (Figure 5e) indicated that there were two types of
acid sites, including 100–200 °C for weak acid sites and
350–450 °C for strong acid sites. Compared to the fresh
catalysts, both the weak and strong acid sites decreased dramatically
for used catalyst-6 and used catalyst-200. There were almost no strong
acid sites on the used catalysts. For different reaction times, the
strong acid sites decreased to the same degree, but the weak acid
sites decreased as the reaction time increased. This showed that the
strong acid sites were covered by carbon before the weak acid sites.
The active sites for the isomerization were primarily due to the weak
acid sites because the selectivity of the isobutene increased with
the time-on-stream.24 For the regenerated
catalyst, the strong acid site amount decreased, inferring that there
was remaining carbon, which covered the active sites in the regenerated
catalysts. Because of the high amount of carbon deposition, it was
impossible to characterize the used catalysts by Py-IR. Therefore,
only fresh and regenerated catalysts were characterized by Py-IR (Figure 5f), where 1540 cm–1 was assigned to the B acid type and 1450 cm–1 was attributed to the L type. The Py-IR spectra indicated that the
B acid type did not recover completely, whereas the L acid types were
similar when compared to the fresh catalyst. Py-IR aligned well with
the NH3-TPD results and showed that part of the deposited
carbon remained strong in the B acid type, which corresponds well
to the N2 adsorption–desorption and TPO results.
This important discovery indicated that the carbon deposition could
be adjusted by acid type and acid distribution.37,38

Conclusions
ZSM-35 catalysts were synthesized via a
hydrothermal method and
then formed for isomerization catalytic reaction. The amount of acidity
strength and the type of formed ZSM-35 catalysts can be adjusted by
adjusting the binder amount and hydrothermal treatment to maximize
the production of isobutene. Taking the process capacity and economic
performance of chemical companies into consideration, the optimized
reaction conditions were 410 °C for the reaction temperature,
5 h–1 for the WHSV, and a 50% etherified C4 mixture
concentration. In addition, the catalytic performance of the regenerated
ZSM-35 catalysts after running 296 h was comparable to that of fresh
catalysts, inferring that the regeneration process was excellent and
effective. Coking enhanced the selectivity of isobutene because of
the shape-selective reaction. This research is promising for the industrialization
of the skeletal isomerization of n-butene to isobutene
in the presence of formed and optimized ZSM-35 catalysts under optimal
process conditions.

C5H5N, and H2O is 1:69.1:4.2:x. After gelation was complete, the sol gel was transferred
into an autoclave and crystallized at 160 °C for 64 h. After
the crystallization occurred, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature.
The mixture was filtered with a frame filter and then washed at least
5 times with deionized water to ensure that the pH value of the washed
water was less than 9. Subsequently, the filter cake underwent ion-exchange
with 1 L aqueous solution of 1 M ammonium nitrate twice at 90 °C
for 5 h and was then washed with deionized water until free of chloride
ions. The molecular sieve was dried at 200 °C for 3 h and then
calcined at 350 °C at a heating rate of 1 °C/min for 4 h
in a rotary kiln to obtain the ZSM-35 zeolite powder. The as-prepared
zeolite was further formed, characterized, and tested for activity,
which is explained in the following part.

Formation of ZSM-35 Catalysts
To satisfy the industrial
requirement, ZSM-35 was formed into a clover shape to afford an improved
mechanical strength to the catalyst. During the shaping process, the
binder pseudo-boehmite amount and steam dealumination were systematically
investigated to determine the optimal conditions. The anticrush strength
of the formed catalysts was measured by a particle strength tester
(model YHKC-3A). Details of the forming process are discussed in the Supporting Information, and the flow chart is
shown in Figure S1.

Hydrothermal Treatment of the Catalyst
Approximately,
15 g of 3–5 mm catalysts was loaded into the reactor and hydrothermally
treated at 550 °C and 0.3 MPa for 1 h with a WGSH of 2 h–1. The details of the process are described in the Supporting Information, and the schematic of
the hydrothermal treatment is shown in Figure S2.

Catalytic Reaction
Skeletal isomerization of n-butene was carried
out in a fixed-bed continuous reaction
apparatus (Figure S3) loaded with approximately
5 g of 2–3 mm diameter catalyst. The conversion of n-butene was monitored by varying the catalyst formed under
various conditions, reaction temperature, concentration of n-butene, and WHSV. The temperature of the reaction was
controlled by a temperature control cabinet (590U, Xiamen Yu Electric
Automation Technology Co., Ltd), and the pressure was kept at atmosphere
pressure. Different feedstock concentrations were obtained from an
etherification factory. The product was analyzed using an Agilent
GC-2000 II equipped with a flame ionization detector and an Agilent-GS-Alumina
capillary column (50 m × 0.532 mm). The n-butene
conversion (X, wt %), isobutene selectivity (Si, %), isobutene yield (Yi, wt %), propylene yield (Yp,
wt %), and heavy component of C5+ yield (YC5+, wt %) were calculated
according to eqs 1–5, respectively. 1   2   3   4   5  where M is the mass flow
rate (kg/h), P is the recombination flow rate (kg/h),
and w is the mass fraction of the component (wt %).
Subscript 0 represents the raw material, g represents the gaseous
product (gas phase of production after condensation), l represents
the liquid product (liquid phase of production after condensation),
n represents n-butene, i represents isobutene, p
represents propylene, and C5+ represents the
heavy component including five carbons or greater hydrocarbon in the
liquid product.

Regeneration of the Used Catalysts
The used catalysts
were regenerated at a temperature of 330 °C first and then at
480 °C by burning the coke with 10% oxygen concentrations at
a gas hourly space velocity of 2000 h–1 and a pressure
of 0.1 MPa. The effluent gas was analyzed via an Agilent GC2000 III
analyzer. The regeneration process was completely finished when the
CO2 concentration in the effluent gas was lower than 0.04%.

Catalyst Characterization
The powder XRD patterns were
carried out using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer at 40 kV
with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5406 Å) at 2θ
ranging from 5 and 50° with a step size of 0.02°. The diffraction
lines were identified by matching them with reference patterns in
the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards database.

N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms at −196 °C
were recorded using an ASAP2020M automatic surface ratio and aperture
analyzer (U.S. Quantachrome). The samples were degassed in an N2 flow at 90 °C for 1 h and were subsequently held at
a temperature of 350 °C for 5 h before being measured. The specific
surface area was calculated according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method. The total pore volume was dependent on the adsorbed
N2 volume at a relative pressure of approximately 0.99.
The micropore volume was obtained using the t-plotting
method.

The morphology of these samples was investigated using
a field
emission scanning electron microscope (FEI, Quanta 200f) at an acceleration
voltage of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA.

NH3-TPD
was carried out on an AutoChem II 2920 analyzer
manufactured by Micromeritics (USA) to determine the acidity strength
of the catalyst. Approximately, 0.1 g of the sample was placed in
a sample tube and then heated to 600 °C at 10 °C/min under
a He atmosphere for 1 h to remove the adsorbed molecular components.
Subsequently, the temperature decreased to 40 °C under the He
atmosphere, and then the sample was saturated with 10% NH3/He for 1 h. Weakly physisorbed unsaturated NH3 was removed
with the He flow (100 mL/min) for 30 min. The chemisorbed NH3 was measured via a thermal conductivity detector with a temperature
profile of 10 °C/min up to 600 °C and then held for 30 min
under the same He flow.

Pyridine adsorption Fourier transform
infrared (Py-IR) was used
to determine B acid and L acid concentrations using a Nicolet-6700
infrared spectrometer (U.S., Nicolet). Approximately, 30 mg of the
sample powder was formed into self-supporting tablets and then placed
inside the reaction tank. The sample was purified at 450 °C for
2 h under high vacuum conditions of 1 × 10–3 Pa and then saturated with the probe molecule pyridine at 90 °C.
After the program warmed up to the appropriate measurement temperature
(fixed temperatures were 200 and 350 °C), vacuum desorption (1
× 10–3 Pa) was carried out for 20 min and the
sample was cooled to room temperature. The IR adsorption spectra of
each temperature point were recorded. The adsorption peaks located
at 1547 and 1445 cm–1 were characterized as B acid
and L acid, respectively. The concentration of acid sites was calculated
from the IR results using the extinction coefficient and integrated
intensity of the desorption peak of pyridine and the sample weight
reported by Emeis.25

According to
the Lambert–Beer method, the amount of acid
can be expressed as 6  where A is the absorbance, K is
the molar absorptivity, and L is the
thickness of the sample. Formula 6 can be simplified
as 7   8  where BPy represents the B acid position,
LPy represents the L acid position, and S is the
surface area of the sample sheet. KBPy is approximately 0.059, KLPy is approximately
0.084, and the acid unit is μmol/g. The diameter of the sample
piece R = 1.3 cm. Absorbance A is
obtained by integrating the peak areas in the plot 14450 and 1547
cm–1.

O2-TPO was performed on an
AutoChem 2920 automated equipment
(U.S., Micromeritics) and monitored using a QIC-20 mass spectrometer
(British Hyde). A sample (0.1 g) was purged for 10 min under a He
atmosphere, and then the temperature was increased to 800 °C
at a heating rate of 10 °C/min with 10% O2/He (50
mL/min). The signals of m/z = 4,
18, 32, and 44 were detected by mass spectrometry.

29Si magic-angle spinning NMR spectra were collected
with a Bruker AVANCE III 500 MHz spectrometer at 130.327 MHz with
a 0.9 μs pulse width, 6 μs delay time, and 12 kHz spinning
speed.
