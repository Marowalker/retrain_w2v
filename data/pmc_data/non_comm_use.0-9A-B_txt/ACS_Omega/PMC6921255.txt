We present a simple procedure to create smooth-sided,
transparent
polymer-based microfluidic devices by presegmentation with hydrophobized
glass slides. We study the hypothesis that the smooth side planes
permit rapid multiangle imaging of microfluidic systems in contrast
to the turbid side planes that result from cutting the polymer. We
compare the compatibility of the entire approach with the conventional
widefield microscopy, confocal and 2-photon microscopy, as well as
three-dimensional (3D) rendering and discuss limitations and potential
applications.

1 Introduction
Poly-dimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) is an indispensable tool in today’s
laboratory-on-a-chip research and microfluidics in general, largely
because of its easy molding, biocompatibility, and rapid-prototyping
at low cost, and especially its transparency.1−3 Often, cast
PDMS devices are cut and subsequently bonded to glass or PDMS parts
to make microscope-compatible devices for microfluidic studies.4−6

While this is a rapid and convenient route, cutting the edges
of
PDMS generates turbid areas that scatter the light, inhibiting microscopic
imaging through this angle. In some applications in biological research,
it could be useful to visualize samples from different angles at different
stages in the experiment, which is not possible in devices with turbid
sides.

The established multiangle microscopic methods to generate
two-dimensional
(2D) and three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of samples employ
optical coherence tomography,7,8 Fourier ptychography
of light field measurements,9 deconvolution
of lens-free images,10 or ultrasonography11,12 and generally rely heavily on extensive image processing, while
not generating 2D images of perpendicular planes. Recently, light
field measurement9 and polarized multiangle
total internal reflection fluorescence (MA-TIRF) achieved live cell
imaging below the lateral resolution limit but only at a frequency
of one image every 2 s.13

In contrast
to these methods, which employ only two sides (top
and bottom) of their sample for multiangle imaging, we have devised
a method that will generate devices with four optically clear sides
(top, bottom, front, and back) through which imaging can take place.
By using polished, hydrophobized glass slides, inserted into the PDMS
prior to curing, we can generate clear sided walls that can be used
for rapid multiangle imaging of microfluidic devices across perpendicular
planes, e.g., the x–y-plane
and the x–z-plane.

An alternative way to achieve a high spatial and temporal resolution
in a thick sample (i.e., the proposed devices) is the usage of light
sheet (fluorescence) microscopy (LSM).14 There, the sample is not illuminated along the same optical pathway
that is used to observe the sample but by a sheet of light that spans
the x–y-plane but has only
minimal thickness in the z-direction.14 For this illumination, often Bessel beams or
Airy beams of monochromatic light or lasers are used,15 for they are shape-preserving and self-healing,14,16,17 and thus able to illuminate several
objects in their path without the loss of accuracy due to diffraction.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Widefield Microscopy
Our simple approach
enabled us to record images of our microfluidic system from top view,
side-on view, and, when shining the light at an angle, an enhanced
view that shows more information about the device structure (see Figure 1B–D). The
enhancement was caused by reflection at the air–PDMS interface
and complete transmission at the PDMS–PDMS interface between
the two device halves.

Figure 1 Layout, top-down, side-on, and enhanced views of the microfluidic
platform filled with a solution of Rhodamine B coated silica microspheres.
(A) Mask layout of the device’s top part (left), bottom part,
which was kept to a flat surface (right), and a close-up on the imaged
section (middle). The inner architecture of the device (black) connects
the inlets to the outlets (green). Specific geometries (gray) are
used to align the top and bottom parts of the device. Images of the
section indicated by the magenta rectangle were taken using brightfield
and fluorescence light sources at the same time. The dark blue arrow
indicates the optical pathway of C and D. (B) Top-down (x–y-plane) view of the indicated section of
the device, simultaneously illuminated for fluorescence and brightfield.
(C) Side-on view (x–z-plane)
into the same device, with the plane of focus indicated by the dark
red dashed line and the viewing side indicated by the dark blue arrow.
(D) An enhanced view of the same section of the device; the focal
plane was slightly shifted compared to C, as indicated in yellow,
and the source for the brightfield illumination was projected at an
angle. Thus, the light was reflected on the PDMS–air interface
(gray areas) but transmitted on the PDMS–PDMS interface (black),
which resulted in the distinct projection of the pillars (black rectangles
within gray areas). Nota bene (NB): B and C are shown in annotated
form in Figure 2A,
C.

Within the microfluidic system, fluorescently labeled
silica beads
and internal structures of the microfluidic system (pillars, corners,
inlets) were visible in both the x–y-plane and the x–z-plane, allowing us to determine their position with a high spatial
resolution by taking only a single image per plane (see Figure 2).

Figure 2 Top-down view and side-on views of the device taken by simultaneous
brightfield and fluorescence imaging. (A) Same top-down view of the
device as seen in Figure 1B, with the positions of selected beads indicated by numbers
and that of pillars by yellow rectangles. The dark blue arrow indicates
the optical pathway of B and C. Dashed lines and letters indicate
focal planes corresponding to the side-on views in B and C (see matching
color frame). (B, C) Side-on views into the device along the planes
indicated in A. Yellow rectangles indicate the position of the pillars,
and teal colored numbers indicate the corresponding beads in each
image. Scale bar is the same for all panels and indicates 100 μm.
NB: for unannotated versions of A and C, see Figure 1B, C.

From the side view, we could distinguish whether
the beads were
located at the top or the bottom of the device chamber. Additionally,
the side view exhibited a very low level of background fluorescence
from beads on other focal planes. Using a confocal fluorescence microscope
for imaging does further reduce this background.

There is one
serious limitation to this approach due to the thickness
of the generated microfluidic devices. The width of the device in
the x–y-plane becomes the
height upon rotating to image in the x–z-plane. This height has to fit under the microscope and,
when scanning through the device, the focal plane has to be moved
up through this height. This requires the use of long working distance
objectives (LWDOs), and we recommend a maximum working distance of
at least 3 mm.

2.2 Confocal Microscopy
Due to the dimensions
of the devices, confocal microscopy also required a LWDO, which limited
the use of higher magnification objectives. Thus, the resulting images
were of a comparable quality than the widefield images (see the Supporting Information).

2.3 Two-Photon Microscopy
The experimental
two-photon microscopy setup permitted the devices to be scanned in
both top-down and side-on devices without the need for LWDOs and thus
at higher magnification than widefield and confocal imagery. Using
third harmonic generation, it is possible to image interfaces, i.e.,
PDMS/air (comparable to the enhanced view in Figure 1D, see associated content), which can serve
as a substitute to brightfield images but still require scanning and
are thus much slower to obtain and only work in setups with minimal
scattering, which precluded side-on imaging. An additional advantage
of 2-photon microscopy is the insensitivity toward contaminations
on the sample surface, which allows for easier handling.

2.4 Three-Dimensional Rendering of Images
We rendered two models from the images: one model was created from
the top-down images and another was rendered from the side-on images
we recorded from an identical dual-structure device. While the image-processing
steps were the same, the side-on model looked better when using more
images taken with shorter interspacing than the top-down model, but
it could not recreate the same level of detail within the device.
This, however, can simply be explained with the presence of the grid
in the lower structure, as the images in the gridless single-structure
devices are much clearer (see Figure 3B,C). The grid has a lattice length of 15 μm
with an interspacing of 5 μm, which acts like an array of slits
that create interferences. While the grid reduced the clarity of side-on
widefield micrographs, both confocal and 2-photon microscopies are
impervious to this drawback.

from top-down images. (B) Side-on view of the dual structure recorded

2.5 Potential Applications
Such a grid
can be used as a support structure for in vitro cell culture, supplying
seeded cells with a scaffold that supports the growth and differentiation
into tissues (e.g., dermal or cerebral endothelial tissue cultures),
while the interspacings can carry nutrients to and metabolites from
the cells for further analysis. The possibility to record tissues
from both top-down and side-on views, in combination with high-speed
imaging, could unlock the real-time visualization of barrier function
of cell monolayers, such as gut epithelial cells or endothelial cells.
It would be useful to be able to visualize a cell barrier from a side-on
view to capture conformational changes to the cells during cell transmigration
and other barrier disruptions. Being able to view the cells from the
top while they are growing would enable a quick visual confirmation
that they have formed a confluent layer prior to starting the experiment.

Other applications that could benefit from visualization in a side-on
view would be microfluidic-based drug assays,4,6 visualization
of the glycocalyx and tissues/organs on a chip. The glycocalyx is
an important layer of sugars that coat many cells, and its disruption
is important in many diseases.18 It has
historically been difficult to visualize the glycocalyx of cells,19 although the thickness of the layer in cultured
cells in response to stimuli can be estimated using z-stacks of multiple confocal fluorescence microscopy images.20 Direct visualization of the glycocalyx or tissues/organs
on a chip from the side view could grant a better resolution and therefore
a better estimation of their thickness. It would also enable real-time
monitoring of their responses to any kind of stimulus.

3 Conclusions
While the hypothesis holds
true that the presegmentation procedure
generates clear-sided devices that permit microscopy through four
instead of two sides, the device dimensions require the use of long
working distance objectives, which limits the magnification and resolution
that can be achieved. For 2-photon microscopy, this limit is not valid;
however, the setup we used did only show fluorescent signals and required
long acquisition times for each individual image.

Brightfield
imaging is not possible with 2-photon microscopy; however,
third harmonic generation can be used as a substitute for nonfluorescing
samples, since it shows interfaces between materials with optical
density. Third harmonic generation is a scanning method that requires
rather long acquisition times per image.

Using stacks of several
images taken from parallel focal planes,
we could recreate a 3-dimensional impression of the dual-structure
device from both angles and compare them (see Figure 3). While the individual 3D model shows similarities
to each other and to the normal micrographs taken from both the same
and the orthogonal focal plane, there are pronounced differences and
the creation involves massive image processing, which allows creation
of artefacts and demands careful handling of the sample images to
allow automatization and ensure reproducibility.

The main strength
of this approach of generating devices is its
simplicity and low cost, which makes it easily accessible to groups
with limited resources. Additionally, we have shown that with our
approach, we can obtain information about the x–z-plane of microfluidic devices in only one image and scan
along the device in the y-direction, providing additional
information on the images taken in the x–y-plane.

Gridlike structures can cause interferences
in the side-on view,
and all structures that are not perfectly orthogonal or vertical to
the employed optical axis create artefacts, just as is usual in microscopy.

The usage of two instead of one optical axis means that irregularities
in the z-axis of the device cannot be neglected any
more, as can be seen in the appearance of thin vertical structures
at higher magnifications in the inner walls of the device, in Figure 2C. These structures
most likely stem from the lithographic process and influence the quality
of brightfield images along the x–z-plane in these areas. These structures would also be expected
in other vertical walls made from photoresist, and so glass slides
should always be used for generating the clear sides. These distortions
would also preclude imaging along long narrow structures such as channels,
so care should be taken during the device design step that any area
of interest is not shaped in this way (e.g., the leftmost channel
in Figure 2C).

While, in general, it is possible to create devices that allow
light microscopy along the x–y- and x–z-planes, the long
working distance that is needed for upright, inverted, and confocal
microscopy preclude higher magnifications. While 2-photon microscopy
can be used to achieve higher magnifications with such a thick sample,
it is still very expensive, does not allow for brightfield imaging,
and requires long sampling times for each image.

Light sheet
microscopy and the presegmentation procedure might
be a very powerful combination, providing high magnification at high
frame rates, but it would be a costly combination that has not been
tested yet.

All in all, this presegmentation procedure really
does generate
clear-sided devices that are compatible with common microscopy techniques
(Table 1) and unlocks
multiangle imaging for many potential applications (e.g., artificial
cells, tissue engineering, organs on a chip, replacing animal experiments,
etc.) and, arguably, for (almost) everybody.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Glass Slide Hydrophobization
The
hydrophilicity of untreated glass slides can result in low contact
angles at the interface of liquid PDMS and glass, generating a meniscus
in the PDMS, which introduces unwanted lens effects at the edges of
each PDMS device.

This meniscus can be reduced by hydrophobizing
the glass surface. To do this, cleaned, polished glass slides (Menzel
Gläser, VWR, U.K.) were exposed to a saturated atmosphere of
1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluoro-octyl-trichloro-silane (Sigma, U.K.) at around
1 mbar for 15 min to 8 h. Excessive silane was washed off with methanol.

4.2 Device Preparation
The devices were
produced with standard soft-lithography methods as described previously.21 Briefly, SU 8-3050 photoresist (MicroChem) was
spin-coated onto commercially available 4-inch silicon wafers according
to the manufacturer’s directions and exposed to ultraviolet
(UV) light through a mask (Compugraphics Jena, Germany) on a mask
aligner (MA6; Süss MicroTec, Switzerland) and developed using
UV light of 345 nm wavelength to create masters. PDMS monomer and
curing agent (Corning, U.K.) were mixed in a 10:1 ratio and poured
over the masters. The devices used in this paper consisted of a simple
open chamber with two inlet/outlet channels and a row of support pillars
along the middle (see Figure 1A).

Prior to curing the PDMS, hydrophobized glass slides
were placed orthogonally to the silicon wafer on either side of the
device design. Glass slides were glued to a supportive structure (e.g.,
pixel pegboards, Junio, Denmark, see Figure 4) such that they could be held orthogonal
to the master and parallel to each other. The supporting structures
could be made of any other material and were intended to keep the
glass slides at the desired distances and orthogonal to the wafer
surface. Once the glass slides were placed in the PDMS, it was cured
at 80 °C overnight.

Figure 4 Device preparation: (A) clean microscopy glass
slides were hydrophobized
and glued onto the supporting scaffolds (e.g., pixel pegboards) at
the desired intervals, ensuring that the glass slides were aligned
parallel to each other and orthogonal to the supporting scaffolds.
(B) After the glass slides were stably affixed to the supporting scaffolds,
the resulting construction was placed between the microfluidic structures
(tinted in green, with magenta frames for visibility) on top of a
master prior to adding and curing the PDMS. (C) Device (consisting
of two PDMS halves, covalently bound together) is shown standing upright,
with its x–z-plane on a glass
microscopy slide, while the pathway of light is parallel to the x–y-plane of the device.

When pouring the PDMS and placing the glass slides,
care was taken
to ensure that any parts through which imaging would take place were
thin enough that the area of interest would lie within the focal range
of the microscope.

4.3 Single-Structure Device
For the first
experiments, we used a single structure (see Figure 1A “top”, Figure 2) as one half of the device that was combined
with a plain cube of PDMS to create the devices used for microscopy.

4.4 Dual-Structure Device
By combining
two different structures (see Figure 1A “top and bottom”, Figure 3) into one device, more complex
experiments can be conducted. The dual-structure device has two sets
of inlets and outlets to allow both halves to be supplied independently.
The interface between the halves can be fitted with a separating membrane
or used to grow tissues in vitro, which allows to study diffusion
rates and the tissues response to any kind of stimuli, including metabolomics.
To support in vitro growth of tissues, a grid with a lattice length
of 15 μm plus 5 μm interspacing was integrated in the
bottom half.

4.5 Device Assembly
Once cured, the PDMS
was cut along the ends of the glass slides, pulled from the wafer
and peeled from the enveloping glass slides. Due to the elasticity
of PDMS, this process is solid and reproducible. Careless handling
can result in misaligned glass slides or fingerprints or glove marks
on the clean surface, which can be removed by either using sticky
tape or washing the PDMS with appropriate solvents (e.g., methanol,
isopropanol), with optional ultrasonication and recommended drying.
To allow fluid into the devices, holes were cut into the upper part
of the device using a biopsy puncher (1.5 mm diameter, KIA, Japan).
Two PDMS parts were bonded together after surface activation in reactive
oxygen plasma. Top and bottom parts should be aligned such that the
sides make a flat surface to allow for proper microscopic imaging
(see Figure 4C).

4.6 Widefield Microscopy
Rhodamine B
coated silica beads (Bang Labs, 7–9 μm diameter) at a
concentration of 200 beads/mL were injected into the device, where
they stuck to the inner surface and remained while injecting air to
create a flow-free device for consistent imaging. The beads were excited
with an excitation wavelength of 546 ± 6 nm and detected at an
emission wavelength of 607 ± 40 nm using a Zeiss 20 HE filter-set
on a Zeiss Axio Observer.A1 microscope, with a Zeiss 10× objective
(NA: 0.3), fitted with an Andor iXon camera (Oxford Instruments, U.K.).
Images were processed using Andor Solis X 3238, Irfan view 4.25, and
Gnu Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) 2.8.

4.7 Confocal Imaging
Rhodamine B coated
silica beads (Bang Labs, 3 μm diameter) at a concentration of
(0.001% v/v) were injected into the device, where they stuck to the
inner surface and remained while the water evaporated over night at
room temperature. This created a flow-free device for consistent imaging.
The dye coat was excited at a wavelength of 532 nm and emitted light
was detected at wavelengths longer than 550 nm on a Zeiss LSM 5 Live
microscope, with an onboard camera (Zeiss, Germany). Due to the thickness
of the device, only long working distance objectives (LWDO) with a
maximum working distance of at least 3 mm have been used.

4.8 Two-Photon Microscopy
Two-photon
imaging was carried out on a custom setup, using commercially available
parts at a wavelength of 1050 nm on the same samples as used for confocal
imaging. Rhodamine dye imaged by second harmonic generation and the
interface between air and PDMS was imaged using third harmonic generation.22

4.9 Image Processing for 3D Rendering
To create the 3D models shown in Figure 3, widefield images were recorded as stacks.
To balance nonuniform illumination, matrix-masking method23 was applied using python. Corrected images were
cropped to the area of interest, inverted, and their contrast and
brightness was adjusted to show the structure as bright pixels on
a black background. The resulting grayscale images were aligned using
StackReg plugin24 prior to rendering the
final 3D models using 3D viewer plugin in Fiji.25

4.10 Additional Considerations
If tubing
will be inserted into the devices in downstream applications, the
PDMS must be thick enough to properly hold tubing for fluidic transport.
Since a thin layer of PDMS may be needed for imaging, the resulting
PDMS parts may be too thin to hold the tubing. Therefore, the bottom
and top parts can be either individually cast, or an additional PDMS
layer can be bonded to one part to provide the necessary thickness.

To properly seal a microfluidic device, it might be necessary to
surround it with at least 1 mm of PDMS on all sides. If a microscopy
glass slide with standard thickness (1.35–1.6 mm) is used,
this might limit the choice of objective to LWDO.

For the recording
of images along the x–z-plane,
it is crucial that the setup of the optical path
is adjusted, especially the condenser of the brightfield illumination
needs adjustment when imaging the device along the z-axis, when using inverted or upright microscopes. The usage of two
independent optical pathways, one for the x–y-plane and another for the x–z-plane observations, can counteract the need for constant
adjustment.

4.11 Calculation of Spatial Resolution
The resolution in the x–y-plane is the same for conventional brightfield microscopy. With
our setup, we could resolve 130 individual pixels per 100 μm,
resulting in a 769 nm pixel pitch. For the x–z-plane, resolution was sufficient to separate individual
fluorescent beads (7 μm diameter) within the device (see Figure 2).

Taking these
values as minimal spatial resolution, our approach has a resulting
maximal voxel size of 4.14 × 10–18 m3. Following the equation below, we can calculate the voxel size V using N = number of pixels resolved along
a line of s μm for each of the three dimensions x, y, and z 1  Since the resolution in x and y is equal, we can rewrite the equation eq 1 to 2
