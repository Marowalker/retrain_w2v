Transition-metal-catalyzed
aerobic oxidative coupling of alcohols
and ammonia represents an attractive atom-economical synthetic route
to prepare nitriles. Heterogeneous platinum catalysts have been widely
used for aerobic alcohol oxidation to aldehydes and carboxylic acids
but have not been applied to nitrile synthesis. In this work, we show
that carbon-supported Pt catalysts are effective for this transformation.
Unpromoted Pt is competent with benzylic substrates bearing either
electron-donating or electron-withdrawing substituents. Use of both
K2CO3 and Bi additives accelerates the rate
of alcohol oxidation and affords high yields with challenging heterocyclic
alcohols.

Introduction
Tandem oxidative coupling
reactions between an alcohol and a nucleophilic
partner have emerged as efficient routes to value-added molecules.1 Many reactions of this type emerged in the 1990s
and various functional groups, such as esters, imines, and amides,
are accessible by such methods. Whereas heterogeneous platinum catalysts
have been widely used in the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and
carboxylic acids, they have not been used significantly in tandem
oxidation reactions (Scheme 1A,B).2,3 Here, we report the demonstration
and development of Pt-based catalysts for the four-electron oxidative
coupling of benzylic alcohols and ammonia to afford (hetero)aromatic
nitriles (Scheme 1C).

Scheme 1 Application of Supported Pt Catalysts in Aerobic Alcohol Oxidation
Aromatic nitriles are a prominent
functional group featured in
the synthesis and/or chemical structures of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals,
herbicides, dyes, and polymers.4 Their
importance underlies recent efforts toward catalytic methods for nitrile
synthesis via alcohol/ammonia coupling with homogeneous5 and heterogeneous6 catalysts. Observation of trace amounts of aldehydes in some of
these methods implicates the sequential reaction path shown in Scheme 2, wherein the alcohol
is oxidized to an aldehyde, which then reacts with ammonia to form
a hemiaminal intermediate A. The hemiaminal could undergo
dehydration to the imine B, followed by further dehydrogenation
to the nitrile, or it could undergo direct dehydrogenation to the
amide.7

Scheme 2 Aerobic Oxidative Nitrile Formation
from Alcohols
Results and Discussion
We initiated the present study with benzyl alcohol 1a using supported Pt and other commercially available catalysts known
for alcohol oxidation. Many catalysts exhibited <1% alcohol conversion,
likely due to catalyst poisoning by ammonia, but various Pt catalysts
supported on carbon, silica, and alumina exhibited both alcohol conversion
and nitrile formation (Figure 1A). In an effort to explore Pt-catalyst formulations beyond
those available commercially and to probe factors that contribute
to catalyst activity and selectivity, we synthesized a series of other
Pt and mixed-metal catalysts on various supports and tested their
utility in the oxidative coupling of benzyl alcohol and ammonia (Figure 1B).

(GC) analysis with mesitylene as an internal standard. c15 mol% catalyst.

We selected synthetic
protocols for catalysts that had previously
been reported for the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes or carboxylic
acids under comparable reaction conditions (liquid phase, mild temperatures).
Variables that were evaluated in these syntheses included the reducing
agent, support, and metal co-catalyst. The details concerning the
syntheses of these catalysts and characterization of the best performing
catalyst are provided in section 2 of the Supporting Information.

The best catalyst that emerged from these
initial efforts was Pt
supported on graphite oxide (GO) prepared by the polyol method.8 Reduction of chloroplatinic acid by ethylene
glycol consistently led to more active catalysts than reduction with
NaBH4, as has been observed in other studies and attributed
to the reduced particle size associated with this method.8 Different yields with Pt/Al2O3 in parts (A) and (B) reflect the difference between the commercial
and synthesized catalysts, respectively. Carbon supports proved to
be more effective than metal oxide supports, and among carbon supports,
GO led to the highest activity. Incorporation of other metals, such
as Ru, Au, and Co, generally reduced the activity. Quantitative conversion
to 3a was achieved in 7 h under the conditions with a
catalyst loading of 2.5 mol%. Experiments using aqueous or anhydrous
ammonia showed similar catalytic trends. Addition of water (up to
5 equiv) to reactions with anhydrous ammonia showed no inhibition
from the water, establishing that either ammonia source could be used.

The new Pt/GO catalyst was tested with diverse substrates to assess
the reaction scope and limitations (Table 1). Primary benzylic alcohols with a variety
of substituents reacted to afford the corresponding nitriles in good
to excellent yields. Electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups,
ranging from −OMe to −CF3, were all well-tolerated
in the reactions, and the method was compatible with aryl chlorides
and bromides. The catalyst was not effective with aliphatic alcohols,
such as cyclohexylmethanol and 1-octanol, and exhibited only moderate
activity with several heteroaromatic alcohols, as shown in Table 2. The low activity
with heterocycles, which represent an important motif in industrial
nitrile-containing molecules, prompted us to probe the mechanism of
the reaction.

Oxidation of Alcohols to Nitrilesa
a Conditions: 1 (0.3
mmol) and Pt on GO in CH3CN (1.5 mL) at 90 °C for
20 h. Reactions carried out in a Parr pressure reactor with NH3 and diluted oxygen (9% in N2). Yield determined
by GC analysis or by 1H NMR spectroscopy with mesitylene
as an internal standard. Isolated yields in parentheses.

Table 2 Problematic Substrates
for Pt-Catalyzed
Aerobic Oxidation of Alcohols to Nitriles
When the reaction progress was monitored, relatively
little build-up
of aldehyde was observed (Figure 2), suggesting that the aldehyde is relatively rapidly
converted to the nitrile. A time course for the reaction of benzyl
alcohol 1a was modeled as a first-order series reaction
in which the oxidation of the alcohol to the aldehyde is the first
step and the oxidation of the aldehyde to the nitrile the second step.
A discrepancy between a pure first-order series model and the experimental
data indicates modest deactivation, which is fit well by a model (provided
in section 3 of the Supporting Information) relating the slow decay in catalyst activity to aldehyde exposure.
The fit yielded a k1 of 0.46 h–1 and a k2 of 5.7 h–1.

Figure 2 Time course of Pt-catalyzed nitrile formation. Fit reflects a first-order
reaction model with concomitant catalyst deactivation (see section
3 of the Supporting Information). Conditions: 1a = 0.2 M, Pt/GO = 2 mol%, 5 atm NH3, 3 atm O2 (9% in N2), 90 °C, MeCN. Reactions carried
out in a Parr pressure reactor. Yields determined by GC analysis with
mesitylene as an internal standard.

We then examined whether the excess ammonia could be inhibiting
the alcohol oxidation. Ammonia has been shown to poison Pt catalysts
in other contexts, for example, as a trace contaminant in fuel cells.9 A time profile complementary to the one in Figure 2 was completed in
the absence of ammonia, with the aldehyde as the final product (Figure 3). Alcohol oxidation
was nearly 6 times slower in the absence of ammonia, exhibiting a k1 of 0.08 h–1, thus indicating
that ammonia instead promotes the alcohol oxidation reaction.

Figure 3 Time course
of alcohol oxidation in the presence and absence of
NH3, leading to nitrile and aldehyde final products, respectively.
Fit reflects a first-order reaction model with concomitant catalyst
deactivation (see section 3 of the Supporting Information). Conditions: 1a = 0.2 M, Pt = 2 mol%,
3 atm O2 (9% in N2), 90 °C, MeCN. 5 atm
NH3 for nitrile formation reaction. Yields determined by
GC analysis with mesitylene as an internal standard.

Higher alcohol conversion in the presence of other
nitrogen-containing
bases suggested that ammonia could function as a base as well as a
coupling partner (Table 3). Pt-catalyzed oxidation of benzyl alcohol to aldehyde in the absence
of any additives afforded only 21% alcohol conversion after 2 h (entry
1). NH3 addition doubled the alcohol conversion, with the
product consisting of both aldehyde and nitrile (entry 2). Other amine
bases, such as quinuclidine (entry 3) and DABCO (entry 5), also significantly
increased the alcohol conversion beyond that of the base-free conditions.
Though the addition of triethylamine (entry 4) lowered alcohol conversion,
the results in Table 3 show that amine additives do not necessarily inhibit activity by
coordinating to the Pt. The positive effect of the basic additive
is attributed to promotion of alcohol deprotonation.

K2CO3 was
also tested as a basic additive
and found to enable near-quantitative conversion of the alcohol to
the aldehyde (entry 6).2a This result motivated
the inclusion of K2CO3 in the nitrile reaction,
and addition of 2 mol% K2CO3 to the Pt catalyst
increased benzyl alcohol conversion after 2 h from 34 to 65% (see
Table S1 in the Supporting Information for
optimization of the K2CO3 loading for nitrile
formation). K2CO3 was then tested as an additive
in the reaction of more challenging alcohols, such as heterocycle 1o, and the yield of the nitrile improved to 44% (Table 4, entries 1 and 2;
cf. Table 2).

In an effort to enhance the activity of the platinum
catalyst further,
we considered the incorporation of main group-element promoters, such
as Bi and Pb. Main group elements and other metals have found widespread
use as promoters in heterogeneous catalysis with platinum group metals,
and Bi has been used frequently in alcohol oxidation.2,10 Common explanations for the role of Bi in promoting Pt- and Pd-catalyzed
alcohol oxidation include prevention of over-oxidation of the metal
surface, creation of new sites for productive catalysis, and site-blocking
to prevent side reactions that could poison the catalyst (e.g. decarbonylation).
Recent studies in our lab have highlighted the utility of heterogeneous
“admixture” catalysts, in which the promoter may be
simply added as a salt to the reaction mixture containing the supported
metal catalyst (e.g., Pd/charcoal and Pt/C).11 Building on these and related precedents,12 Bi(NO3)3 was included in the reaction mixture.
Addition of Bi(NO3)3 in a 1:5 ratio relative
to Pt, in addition to K2CO3, raised the nitrile
yield to 71% (entry 3). Further increases of the amount of Bi(NO3)3 did not impact the nitrile yield (entries 4
and 5). Different Bi precursors have been shown to influence catalyst
activity in other alcohol oxidations,13 but Bi metal and BiCl3 were not effective in the present
reaction (entries 6 and 7).

A well-defined PtBi catalyst was
also prepared via the reduction
of Bi(NO3)3 onto a Pt catalyst. This catalyst
exhibited inferior results (entry 8), as did a similar catalyst from
Johnson Matthey (entry 9). Increasing the Pt to 3.5 mol% (a 40% change
in loading) with a concomitant increase in the Bi and K2CO3 to maintain the relative ratios in entry 5, enabled
an excellent yield of product (91%, entry 10). A nitrate salt with
Fe exhibited a low yield (entry 11). However, a nitrate salt containing
Pb, another known Pt promoter, did increase the yield (entry 12).
Similar to the well-defined PtBi0.4 case, a PtPb0.4 catalyst (entry 13) exhibited inferior results to the admixture
catalyst (entry 12).

The promotional effect of the Bi and base
was probed with other
molecules that afforded low yields with the unpromoted Pt catalyst.
The incorporation of base and Bi increased the yield of 3m from 53 to 93% (Table 5). Significantly improved yields were also observed with 3n (81%) and 3p (86%). The new catalyst system also afforded
improved yields with halogen-containing benzyl alcohols, and the utility
of this method was demonstrated in a 1 g-scale oxidative coupling
with 1h, which afforded 4-fluorobenzonitrile 3h in 96% yield (eq 1). 1

b 70 °C (to avoid side reactions).

In conclusion, we have demonstrated
that carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles
can mediate the one-pot aerobic oxidation of alcohols to nitriles.
The Pt catalyst itself enables effective conversion of many benzylic
alcohols to the corresponding benzonitriles, but addition of K2CO3 and Bi significantly improves the catalytic
performance with heterocycle-containing substrates. This work illustrates
the broad utility of Pt in four-electron coupling reactions, as well
as the ease with which its activity may be modified via the use of
promoter metals.

Experimental Section
General Information
All commercially available compounds
and solvents were purchased and used as received, unless otherwise
noted. No precautions were taken to exclude air or water from the
solvent or reaction mixtures. 1H and 13C NMR
spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE III 400 or Bruker AVANCE
III 500 spectrometer. Chemical shift values are given in parts per
million relative to internal tetramethylsilane (0.00 ppm for 1H) or CDCl3 (77.16 ppm for 13C). The
following abbreviations were used to describe peak splitting patterns
when appropriate: s = singlet, d = doublet, m = multiplet, dd = doublet
of doublets. Coupling constants, J, were reported
in hertz (Hz). Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed
on precoated silica gel 60 F254 plates. Visualization on TLC was achieved
by the use of UV light (254 nm). Flash chromatography was performed
on an Isco Combiflash system using SiliaFlash P60 (Silicycle, particle
size 40–63 μm, 230–400 mesh).

Procedure for
Batch Oxidation of Alcohols in a CAT24 Pressure
Reactor
Solutions of alcohol (0.25 mmol), mesitylene (25
mol%) as an internal standard, and aqueous NH3 (3 equiv)
in acetonitrile (0.5 mL) were added to thick-walled glass tubes containing
the platinum catalyst (1 mol% or 4.9 mg for 10 wt% metal loading).
The tubes were inserted into the wells of an HEL CAT24 unit, and the
reactor was sealed and pressurized to 31 atm with premixed gas consisting
of 9% O2 in N2 (for an O2 pressure
of 3 atm). The reactor was agitated using a custom vortexer at 90
°C for 7 h. Afterward, the reactor was cooled to <40 °C.
Each reaction mixture was then filtered through a pipette containing
celite and glass wool and analyzed by GC to determine the product
concentration.

Procedure for Batch Oxidation of Alcohols
in a Parr Pressure
Reactor
A solution of alcohol (0.3 mmol) and mesitylene (25
mol%), as an internal standard, in acetonitrile (1.5 mL) was added
to a 40 mL stainless steel Parr pressure vessel containing the platinum
catalyst (2.5 mol% or 14.6 mg for 10 wt% metal loading). For the enhanced
reaction conditions, 1 mol% Bi (2 mg based on Bi(NO3)3·5H2O) and 2 mol% K2CO3 (0.8 mg) were added. The Parr vessel was sealed and pressurized
to 1 atm with anhydrous NH3 and then pressurized to 32
atm with premixed gas consisting of 9% O2 in N2 (for an O2 pressure of 3 atm). The mixture was stirred
with a 1/4 in. rectangular stir bar, heated to 90 °C, and reacted
for 20 h. Upon completion, the reactor was allowed to cool down to
<40 °C. The reaction mixture was then filtered through a pipette
containing celite and glass wool and analyzed by GC to determine the
product concentration.

Procedure for the Scale-Up Reaction
An 8 mL solution
containing 1 g of 1h (1 M) in acetonitrile was added
to a 40 mL stainless steel Parr pressure vessel containing the catalyst
components. The catalyst consisted of 3.5 mol% Pt (546 mg for 10 wt%
metal loading), 1.4 mol% Bi (54.5 mg based on Bi(NO3)3·5H2O), and 2.8 mol% K2CO3 (31 mg) relative to the alcohol. Given the greater quantity of alcohol,
the Parr vessel was sealed and pressurized to 6 atm with anhydrous
NH3 and then pressurized to 37 atm with premixed gas consisting
of 9% O2 in N2 (for an O2 pressure
of 3 atm). The mixture was stirred with a 1/4 in. rectangular stir
bar, heated to 90 °C, and reacted for 20 h. Upon completion,
the reactor was allowed to cool down to <40 °C.

GC Method and
Retention Times
GC analyses were performed
using a DB-Wax column (length = 30 m, i.d. = 0.25 mm) installed in
a Shimadzu GC-17A equipped with a flame-ionization detector. A 14
min GC method consisted of a 1 min hold at 70 °C, ramp at 20
°C/min from 70 to 200 °C (6.5 min), and a 3.5 min hold at
200 °C. The injector and the detector were held at 225 °C,
and the column flow was 1.5 mL/min of He with a split ratio of 20.
Retention times were as follows: mesitylene (3.78 min), benzyl alcohol 1a (8.05 min)/benzaldehyde 2a (5.76 min)/benzonitrile 3a (6.30 min), 4-methylbenzyl alcohol 1b (8.34
min)/4-methylbenzonitrile 3b (7.05 min), 4-methoxybenzyl
alcohol 1e (11.78 min)/4-methoxybenzonitrile 3e (9.60 min), 4-chlorobenzyl alcohol 1i (10.65 min)/4-chlorobenzonitrile 3i (7.74 min), 4-bromobenzyl alcohol 1j (12.97
min)/4-bromobenzonitrile 3j (8.80 min), 2-bromobenzyl
alcohol 1k (11.62 min)/2-bromobenzonitrile 3k (9.42 min), 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl alcohol 1l (8.15
min)/4-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile 3l (5.57 min).

Another GC method consisted of a 1 min hold at 70 °C, ramp at
6 °C/min from 70 to 200 °C (22.5 min), and a 6.5 min hold
at 200 °C. Retention times were as follows: 3-thiophenemethanol 1m (14.59 min)/3-thiophenecarbonitrile 3m (17.75
min), 6-methyl-2-pyridinemethanol 1n (16.31 min)/6-methyl-2-pyridinecarbonitrile 3n (17.04 min).

NMR Characterization
For crude reaction
mixtures analyzed
by 1H NMR spectroscopy (3c, 3d, 3f, 3g, 3h, 3o, 3p), 3 mL of CDCl3 was added to the reactor
upon completion of the reaction. An aliquot of the reaction mixture
was transferred to an NMR tube, and the tube was centrifuged to settle
the solid catalyst prior to analysis.

Isolation
For
collection of the isolated product, the
catalyst was filtered off and washed with ethyl acetate. The filtrate
was concentrated in vacuo and the corresponding nitrile was purified
by column chromatography (silica; hexanes–ethyl acetate mixture).
The appropriate solvent ratio was identified by TLC. The chromatography
solvents were removed in vacuo to afford the isolated nitrile. Spectral
properties of all products are consistent with the literature values.

Isolated yields are shown below. To facilitate isolation, the reactions
were performed on a 4 mL scale (instead of the 1.5 mL scale noted
in Table 1). The NH3 pressure was increased to 3 atm given the larger scale.
