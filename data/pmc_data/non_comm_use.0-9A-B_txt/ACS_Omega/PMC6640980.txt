method for solid-state nanoporous
membranes based on the casting of sacrificial silicon nanostructures.
The process allows the individual definition of geometry and placement
of each nanopore through e-beam lithography and is compatible with
a wide range of materials without the need to adapt the process to
the materials used. We demonstrate the fabrication of membranes integrating
high aspect-ratio nanopores with critical dimensions as small as 30
nm, 1.2 μm in length, with round or elongated shapes, and made
of silicon dioxide or amorphous carbon. The capability to engineer
nanoporous membranes made of a variety of materials and with tailored
designs will lead to new applications in the field of electrochemical
sensing, flow modulation, or the chemical functionalization of nanopores.

1 Introduction
Technological advances
in the field of micro- and nano-fabrication
have recently enabled unique applications based on the peculiar properties
of nanofluidics. The ability to modulate relevant nanochannel parameters
such as critical dimensions or the span of the electrical double layer
has extended the use of nanoporous membranes from passive to active
applications such as water-desalination, nanofluidic diodes,1,2 or transistors.3,4 Nanofluidic devices actively controlling
the behavior of liquids at the molecular level could lead to breakthroughs
in nanomedicine, filtration, energy production, or biochemical analysis.5−8

Although nanofluidics is relevant to many fields of research,
its
development has been hindered by the lack of reliable and flexible
manufacturing techniques enabling engineering of key parameters such
as nanopore geometry, surface charge, and materials.5,9−11

Different methods have been developed to fabricate
solid-state
nanoporous membranes. The most widespread and commercially successful
is the track-etching of membranes, whereby the pores are defined through
heavy atom bombardment of polymeric films.12 A new approach to synthesize polymeric membranes through self-assembly
of block-copolymers has recently emerged.13 This approach allows the synthesis of large surface membranes with
control over the porosity and pore dimension, however it falls short
when nonpolymeric materials or more strict pore positioning are desired.14 To extend the choice of materials beyond polymers,
the intrinsic properties of aluminum anodization were exploited to
define a self-assembled hard mask for the material of interest.1,4 Although these methods allow the quick fabrication of membranes
with controlled porosity and pore size, they rely on stochastic methods
and are thus inappropriate when a more rigorous control over single-pore
geometry and positioning is required. Methods that independently define
the pore shape and placement were developed using focused ion beam
(FIB) or electron beam lithography (EBL). FIB-based methods, which
independently sculpt every single nanopore of the membrane,15 are widely used for the fine control they offer
over nanopore geometry but, due to their serial nature, are time consuming
and inappropriate for large scales. EBL followed by deep reactive
ion etching (DRIE) is faster and more time efficient than FIB, but
the geometries one can obtain are limited by the performance of the
DRIE on the membrane material.16 To increase
the range of materials and properties at the nanopore–liquid
interface, an effort was made to coat nanopores with different materials
using techniques ranging from atomic layer deposition17,18 to organic coatings.2 This effectively
changes the surface charge of the nanopores or electrically insulates
the underlying electrodes. Other techniques rely on the control of
intrinsic properties of materials such as Nafion,19 or on the controlled creation of defects to define nanopores.20 Finally, techniques based on sacrificial structures
to define the shape of the nanopores were developed using track-etched
membranes,21 silicon structures,22 or SiO2 layers23,24 as a template. These approaches can be more laborious than the ones
previously cited but are more general and often offer greater flexibility
in terms of the design and choice of material. However, even when
using sacrificial templates to define the placement and positioning
of nanopores, the fabrication method still strongly influences the
capability to engineer the membrane. The use of hydrofluoric acid
to remove SiO2 templates23,24 limits the
use of metals in the process. Additionally, the use of evaporation
to obtain multilayers22 results in pores
with conical sections. A manufacturing method allowing the simultaneous
definition of a material, and the position and shape of the nanopores
is still missing.

We propose here an innovative wafer-scale
method based on sacrificial
silicon templates to fabricate solid-state nanoporous membranes in
a wide range of materials. The presented method defines the geometry
of each nanopore by means of a silicon template (Figure 1(1)), which is thereafter used
as a sacrificial cast for the desired material for the membrane (Figure 1(2)). The advantage
of this rationale is that the placement and geometry of each nanopore
is independent of the materials used to cast the membrane and thus
relies only on the micromachining of the silicon templates by EBL
followed by DRIE, which are reliable processes, well controlled, and
uniform at the wafer scale.25 Once the
material comprising the membrane is conformally molded on the templates,
the whole surface is planarized until the silicon template forms the
desired surface from the surrounding material using a process that
combines chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) and ion beam etching
(IBE) (Figure 1(3)).
The selective removal of the silicon template with a combination of
consecutive KOH and XeF2 etches (Figure 1(4)) at the end of the process reveals the
nanopore, whose shape is the exact negative of the silicon template
(Figure 1(5)).

Figure 1 Graphical representation
of the process flow. First, the sacrificial templates are obtained
in bulk silicon (1). Second, the interfacial (blue) and the passive
material (yellow) are deposited frontside (2). After planarization
combining CMP and IBE methods (3), the membrane is released (4) through
timed KOH etching followed by XeF2 etching. The final result
(5) is a suspended membrane whose nanopores at the electrolyte-nanopore
interface are made of the “interface material” (blue)
and whose shape and positioning are defined through e-beam lithography.

The advantages of the presented
strategy compared to other fabrication
methods are numerous. The use of a combination of EBL and DRIE to
define the shape of the silicon structures allows control of the placement
and geometry of every single pore by design, independent from other
nanopores and from the material used for the membrane. Free-shaped,
nonround, conic or high aspect-ratio nanopores can thus be easily
manufactured in a reliable manner.

The use of conformal deposition
methods to deposit the material
comprising the membrane has several implications. First, it allows
the deposition of a wide range of materials and with different technologies,
from sputtering to different variants of chemical vapor deposition
(CVD), as long as the material is deposited adherent to the template.
Second, the possibility to stack different layers on top of each other
to constitute the membrane enable fine engineering of the membrane
mechanical and interfacial properties. This concept is illustrated
in Figure 1, where
a stack of two materials (blue and yellow) is used to form the membrane.
The underlying material (blue) is deposited first and then covered
with a second material (yellow). At the end of the process, the blue
layer dictates the solid–liquid interface behavior of the nanopore
whereas the yellow material does not contribute to the nanofluidic
properties of the device but provides the desired mechanical properties
for the structure. This enables the use of materials for the nanopore–electrolyte
interface that are usually not suitable for monolithic membranes due
to cost, mechanical properties, or quality of deposition. The proposed
method relies on a cleanroom process, which is widespread, reliable,
well controlled, quick, and uniform at the wafer scale (unlike, e.g.,
FIB). The process is easily integrable within a more complex process
flow (e.g., for microfluidic channel fabrication) and enables the
integration of multiple membranes with different properties and geometries
within the same device. As a proof-of-concept, we present here a passive
nanoporous membrane made of a thin layer of hydrogenated amorphous
carbon–nitrogen (a-C:N:H)26 as the
interface material and SiO2 as the structural material,
embedding nanopores with critical dimensions from 30 to 70 nm, 1.2
μm long, with round and elongated geometries. a-C:N:H can be
easily deposited through CVD and has a wide polarizable window;27 it is therefore an ideal candidate for a nanopore–liquid
interface material in gating applications. SiO2, on the
other hand, is inert, electrically insulating, and mechanically robust
which justifies its choice as the structural material.

2 Results
2.1 Template Definition
Arrays of silicon
nanostructures were defined through EBL using hydrogen silsesquioxane
(HSQ) as the resist and carved in the bulk of a silicon wafer using
a continuous DRIE process based on SF6 and C4F8.22,28 The nanostructures were fabricated
with two different geometries (round and wavy), three different etching
times (4, 6, and 8 min), and with a pitch of 1 or 3 μm (Figure 2a,b). For an etch
process of 4 min, round silicon structures (nanopillars) with diameters
down to 40 and 1220 nm tall were fabricated with HSQ masks of 50 nm
in diameter. Structures 1690 nm tall (6 min etch) showed an increase
in the minimal diameter that could be successfully fabricated to 49
nm, and structures 2260 nm tall (8 min etch) were obtained with minimal
diameters of 70 nm. The maximal aspect-ratio for the columnar structures
was 30–34 regardless of height (Figure 2c). Etching times higher than 8 min were
not investigated as all of the 130 nm of HSQ used as a mask was consumed
at this point, resulting in a selectivity of the etch process of about
17, silicon to HSQ.

Figure 2 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of the
template
structures etched in bulk silicon and of height 1200 nm. (a) Array
of nanopillar templates obtained with HSQ masks of 50 nm of diameter.
A uniform underetch of about 10 nm can be observed all along the silicon
nanopillars. (b) Wavy nanofins, 1 μm long and with critical
dimensions of 30 nm. These structures showed an improved stability
with respect to that of the nanopillars. (c) Measured minimal diameters
obtained as a function of the height of the template for the nanopillars.
The maximal aspect-ratio that can be achieved is ≈30–34.
Scale bars are 1 μm.

As previously described,22 the
shape
of the template can influence the stability of the silicon structure,
and thus the minimal critical dimension attained. Wavy linear structures
(nanofins) were fabricated and critical dimensions of 30 nm were consistently
obtained, independently from the height of the structure and etching
times.

2.2 Influence of Etching
The DRIE process
used to carve the silicon nanostructures can be tuned to control the
shape of the nanopores. The quantity of passivator (C4F8) and etchant (SF6) gasses used during the etching
step determines the verticality of the walls of the template. An excess
of SF6 results in structures with a tip wider than the
base (underetch), whereas a greater quantity of passivator results
in structures where the base is wider than the tip because of the
accumulation of C4F8 on the wafer. Furthermore,
the density of the patterns influences the optimal ratio of SF6/C4F8 similar to a “load effect”:
the denser the pattern, the higher the area to passivate, the higher
the flow of C4F8 needed for optimal results.
Two guidelines can be given based on such considerations: first, the
mentioned “load effect” creates a trade-off between
uniformity of the structures and local variation of template density.
Second, by tailoring the SF6/C4F8 ratio, conical sacrificial structures (and therefore conical pores)
can be easily obtained. In our case, the etching process was optimized
for columnar structures of 50 nm. The same etching recipe is suboptimal
for structures with a slightly greater surface, such as nanofins,
which were therefore produced with a base slightly wider than the
tip.

2.3 Impact of Conformal Deposition Process
The aforementioned silicon nanostructures were then coated with 250
nm of a-C:N:H and 2 μm of SiO2, corresponding to
the blue and yellow regions, respectively, in Figures 1 and 3. The process
used to deposit SiO2 is not perfectly conformal, and therefore
voids were created between nanostructures whose pitch was not greater
than the height of the structures. This is a well known and characterized
process, which has even been exploited to fabricate nanochannels.29 In our case, given the high aspect-ratio of
the structures, the relationship between the desired thickness of
a membrane and the minimal distance between pores (pitch) needs to
be considered when designing the membrane. Membranes with templates
too closely packed together will result in small bumps around the
pores and a thinned membrane, whereas a membrane with templates sufficiently
spaced from each other will not suffer from these limitations. In Figure 3, an array is shown
with 1 μm tall structures either spaced 1 μm (left) or
3 μm (right) apart. The FIB cross-sections at the top show how
the void is a direct consequence of the deposition method and pitch
between nanostructures. The SEM micrographs at the bottom show the
effect of the presence of voids on the structure of the membrane after
planarization. Such voids are not present when the pitch is greater
than twice the height of the nanostructures, thus the membrane is
flat as shown in Figure 3b,d.

Figure 3 FIB (a, b) and SEM (c, d) micrographs showing the effect of the
nanostructure pitch on the nanoporous membrane (all images are taken
with a tilt of 45°). When the pitch between silicon nanostructures
is smaller than twice their height (a), voids form between the structures.
When the pitch is greater (b), the nanostructures are covered well
and no voids are observable. The bottom images (c, d) show the impact
of a proximity effect once the samples are planarized. Voids present
when nanostructures are closely packed cause a thinning of the membrane
between nanopores (c). When the nanostructures are spaced enough,
the membrane shows no defects (d). Scale bars on all figures are 1
μm.

2.4 Planarization
Characterization
The
process of uncovering the buried silicon nanostructures through planarization
and thinning of the membrane material is of utmost importance, as
the thickness and surface quality of the membrane depends on it. CMP
is the reference process for planarization and thinning of thin films
but suffers from some important drawbacks: it is difficult to obtain
a uniform etch rate at the wafer scale and the whole process is strongly
material-dependant which means that the results on heterogeneous structures
would have to be optimized for every material combination. IBE does
not suffer from those problems because it is not a material-dependent
process and has a uniform etch rate at the entire wafer scale. However,
IBE is not suitable for planarization as its nature tends to preserve
the surface topography of the wafer rather than planarize it. The
strategy we adopted efficiently combines CMP and IBE to take advantage
of both techniques. First, a uniform flat surface is obtained with
a short CMP step (≈1 min) that levels the wafer without significantly
affecting the native uniformity of the film. Then, IBE is used to
uniformly etch the entire frontside of the wafer until the buried
silicon nanostructure surface is obtained from the surrounding material
(Figure 4a). To prevent
prematurely reaching the underlying a-C:N:H layer or the silicon structures
early during the CMP step, about 1 μm of SiO2 in
excess was deposed. This way, the CMP process will only “see”
the SIO2 layer on top, independent of the material underneath.

Figure 4 (a) Diagram
showing the rationale of the planarization process
developed, consisting of a short polishing step with CMP (1 min) to
remove the “bumps” over the templates, followed by an
IBE etch to expose the buried silicon nanostructures. (b) Left: Increase
in the standard deviation (STD) of a SiO2 layer with CMP
time, measured on three different wafers. Right: The same three wafers
before and after IBE of 4, 6, and 8 min, showing no significant variation
in STD of the films after IBE.

To investigate in more detail, a suboptimal CMP processing
of SiO2 was characterized on three different wafers for
three different
etch times (1, 2, and 3 min). The thickness and uniformity of the
SiO2 film was measured before and after CMP at 25 points
with an interferometer to evaluate the rate and uniformity of the
process. Although the etch rate can be considered constant (350 nm
min–1, not shown), the uniformity of the film decreases
with CMP time. It is clear from Figure 4b-left how, after 1 min of CMP, the nonuniformity of
the SiO2 film, represented by the standard deviation of
the thickness of the SiO2 layer over the entire wafer surface,
increases with etch time. The same wafers were then processed with
IBE for three different times (4, 6, and 8 min) to characterize the
etch rate and uniformity of the process. Figure 4b-right shows how the measured standard deviation
remains unchanged before and after IBE etching, and this is independent
from the etch time. Furthermore, the measured IBE etch rates are extremely
reproducible and were measured to be (80 ± 3) nm min–1.

The precision and control provided by this technique were
consistently
used to level and thin SiO2 films with a precision of ±10
nm, independent of the combination of materials used and without having
to adapt the CMP or IBE parameters.

2.5 Membrane
Release and Final Results
By combining the controlled nanostructure
fabrication and the planarization
method previously mentioned, arrays of silicon templates embedded
in a-C:N:H and SiO2 were fabricated. The fabricated array
had 441 template nanostructures deposited in a hexagonal lattice and
spaced 1 and 3 μm apart. The structures did not show defects
and had uniform thickness and template geometry along the entire array
(Figure 5a). Figure 5b,c shows further
magnification of the nanopillar and wavy nanofin silicon templates
embedded in a-C:N:H and SiO2. As shown in Figure 5b, the 40 nm silicon template
is clearly distinguishable as a brighter spot in the middle of the
image. The amorphous carbon layer surrounding the template is slightly
set back in the SiO2 film because of its minimally different
etch rate during the IBE process. Wavy template nanofins with critical
dimensions of 30 nm, shown in Figure 5c, were successfully processed without any modifications
of the fabrication process used for the template nanopillars. No differences
in terms of uniformity or stability of the process were observed compared
to that for the columnar templates or depending on the different material
combinations tested.

and nanopillar) surfacing from a-C:N:H and SiO2, right

them. Scale bars are 100 nm. (d, e) The frontside and backside, respectively,
of the same membrane as (a) and (c) after XeF2 release
from the pores resulting in nanopores of ≈40 nm. Scale bars
are 200 nm.

Following a partial backside
KOH etch, the silicon template nanostructures
were removed through XeF2 etching, revealing nanopores
whose shape corresponds to the negative of the silicon nanostructures
(Figure 5d,e).

The XeF2 etch has a key role in the fabrication process.
XeF2 gas etching is known to selectively affect only silicon,
silicon nitride, tungsten, and titanium, the etch rate for other materials
being null.30,31 This high selectivity allows
a wide spectrum of materials to be used in the process without having
to adapt the release of the nanopores to the material used and without
compromising the final geometry of the nanopore. Furthermore, XeF2 etching of silicon, being purely chemical (without the physical
ion bombardment characteristic of plasma etching), guarantees not
to damage either the nanopore walls or the membrane surface.

2.6 Functional Test
To verify the functionality
and integrity of the membrane, its transmembrane electrical resistance
was measured and compared to that from theoretical predictions. The
chip was placed between two reservoirs filled with 1 M KCl (Figure 6a), and the current
flowing across the membrane was measured as a function of the transmembrane
voltage with a potentiostat (Figure 6b). To calculate the resistance of the membrane, we
neglected any nanofluidic effects as the high electrolyte concentration
resulted in no overlap of the electrical double layer, therefore the
theoretical resistance of the system was dictated purely by geometrical
parameters Table 1.
The total resistance of the system is the sum of the geometrical resistance
of the membrane Rmem, the access resistance
for each pore on both sides of the membrane Racc, and the resistance of the KOH pyramid, RKOH. The bulk resistance Rbulk and the electrode–electrolyte interface resistance were neglected.
The geometrical resistance for a membrane with n pores
of diameter 2r and length h is defined
as 1  where ρKCl is the resistivity
of 1 m KCl. The access resistances were estimated using the
formula32 2  and the KOH pyramid resistance was calculated
as 3  where d and D are, respectively, the size of the small
and large side of the KOH
pyramid, and t is the thickness of the wafer. The
total electrical resistance of the membrane is therefore 4  A fracture, leakage, or defect in
the membrane
would result in currents greater than expected and, as the measurements
are in good agreement with theoretical data, we can assume the integrity
of the membrane and an absence of any leakages. This demonstrates
the high control over the geometrical parameters achievable with the
presented fabrication strategy.

the transmembrane resistivity.
At the bottom is the equivalent electrical circuit used to calculate
the theoretical I–V curve.

in a 1 M KCl solution through a membrane with 441 nanopores with diameters

3 Discussion
3.1 Considerations of Pore Geometry
The
ability to control the pore geometry is important for many applications
involving nanoporous membranes.

In applications such as nanofluidic
transistors3 or diodes,2 the critical dimension of the nanochannel has to be smaller
than twice the Debye length for the electric double layer (EDL) overlap
to occur.33−35

By controlling the geometry of the nanopore,
it will be possible
to fabricate membranes capable of discriminating between specific
molecules or particles. Experiments have shown that by engineering
longitudinal irregularities inside nanopores, the shape and volume
of translocating objects can be deduced.36 Such nanopores can be fabricated by slightly modifying the fabrication
process previously presented using an alternating Bosch-process to
fabricate corrugated templates. This would result in nanopores with
corrugations where the roughness of the structure is defined by the
scalloping effect.37

The same nanopores
with controlled corrugation but made of hydrophobic
materials could be used to produce membranes with extremely low hydrodynamic
resistance, which may be particularly efficient in the study of streaming
currents.

Finally, the presented method allows the controlled
fabrication
of high aspect-ratio nanopores regardless of the materials used, which
is impossible to imitate with other manufacturing techniques. This
opens up interesting perspectives for electro-osmotic control of flows
where effects of back-pressure flows will be mitigated by the higher
hydrodynamic resistance of high aspect-ratio nanochannels.

3.2 Discussion on Materials
Membranes
made of a-C:N:H–SiO2 and purely SiO2 were
successfully fabricated with the very same process and showed the
same quality in terms of pore geometry and yield. The possibility
to change and stack materials as desired without the need to adapt
the fabrication process, and the variety of materials that can be
used by this process have many implications.

The compromise
between interface properties and mechanical stability of a membrane
often necessary for monolithic membranes can be easily avoided. The
function of mechanically supporting the membrane is entrusted to the
passive material (in our case SiO2) whereas the interface
properties of the nanopore can be optimally chosen for the desired
application (a-C:N:H in our case) as long as it can withstand XeF2. This results in a wide choice of materials as most materials,
including oxides, metals, and organic compounds are not at all or
weakly attacked by XeF2.30 Therefore,
nanopores made of exotic or expensive materials can be fabricated
with thicknesses that would not be possible with other techniques
for the sake of mechanical stability, material-stress, or cost. Additionally
to a-C:N:H–SiO2 and monolithic SiO2,
we explored the use of other materials. A membrane with 200 nm of
platinum (Pt) at the nanopore–electrolyte interface and SiO2 as the structural material was fabricated using the same
process as that for the a-C:N:H–SiO2 and SiO2 membranes.

Furthermore, the number of combined materials
is not limited to
two. Additional layers can be integrated in the stack that, once planarized,
could behave as functional electrodes directly integrated in the membrane.

This flexibility in the choice of materials opens up new opportunities
for easy functionalization of nanopores as the most appropriate membrane-material/surface-chemistry
couple can be chosen.11 Simulations have
shown that grafting charged polymers inside nanopores dramatically
impacts the potential distribution inside nanochannels,38 and that nanopores functionalized with poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) may prevent fouling in an efficient way.39 For example, high aspect-ratio gold nanopores,
easily functionalizable with thiol-terminated molecules, can be fabricated
in a reliable and cost efficient way with the presented method by
stacking a thin layer of gold and chrome (for adhesion) and a thick
layer of SiO2 as the structural support.

One other
promising class of materials to investigate are polarizable
materials such as boron-doped diamond, diamond-like carbon or a-C:N:H.27,40−42 Nanopores made of polarizable materials at the nanopore–electrolyte
interface are suitable for gating applications as they enable a potential
to be applied at an interface without leakage currents. In this way,
it is possible to directly modulate the magnitude and polarity of
the surface charge at the nanopore–liquid interface with low
or no leakage currents, thus getting rid of the insulating layer and
its electric field damping.3,43,44

4 Conclusions
We demonstrated a new strategy
for the manufacturing of solid-state
nanoporous membranes with pore geometry, positioning, and thickness
independently defined from each other. The method relies on the use
of sacrificial silicon nanostructures as templates to cast the nanopores,
thus being compatible with a wide range of materials. Critical aspects
and limitations of the process include an attainable maximal aspect-ratio
of 35, the relation with the template shape and its stability, and
the necessary trade-off between porosity and membrane thickness. Arrays
of nanopores were obtained with the same procedure and without observable
defects with critical dimensions as little as 30 nm and 1.2 μm
long, made of monolithic SiO2 and a combination of a-C:N:H
and SiO2. The functionality and integrity of the fabricated
membranes as well as the high control provided over the geometrical
parameters were proven through SEM inspection and transmembrane resistivity
measurements. Manufacturable alternatives of nanopore geometries and
potential new materials possible due to the presented method leading
to innovative applications of nanofluidic membranes were discussed.
The presented fabrication strategy provides a new tool to fabricate
nanoporous membranes at the wafer scale with simultaneous control
over nanopore shape, material, and placement. The freedom in tailoring
the membrane characteristics to the desired application will open
new perspectives in the field of functional materials and active control
of molecules inside nanopores.11

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Sacrificial Silicon Template
Fabrication
The nanopore geometries were defined with frontside
e-beam lithography
on a double side polished silicon wafer (Figure 1(1)), covered by a thin film of 120 nm of
Si3N4 on the backside only to be used as a hard
mask for a KOH etching step later in the process. On the frontside,
140 nm of 6% HSQ was used as a negative tone e-beam resist (Dow Corning,
XR-1541-006). The patterns were then transferred in the bulk silicon
through DRIE specifically optimized28 to
obtain the sacrificial structures used as the template. The resulting
structures had critical dimensions down to 30 nm for heights up to
2.7 μm. The details of this fabrication step are presented in
a previous publication.22

5.2 Membrane Deposition
The material
comprising the membrane–electrolyte interface, the membrane
material, and the material physically supporting the membrane, the
support material, were then conformally deposited on top of the templates
(in blue and yellow, respectively, in Figure 1(2)). The membrane material was 250 nm of
a-C:N:H deposited through CVD (Oxford PlasmaLab 100, 50 W of RF generator
power, 800 mTorr deposition chamber pressure at a temperature of 45
°C for 40 min).26 As the support material,
2 μm of SiO2 was deposited through CVD (Oxford PlasmaLab
100, 20 W of RF generator power, 1500 mTorr deposition chamber pressure
at a temperature of 300 °C for 40 min).

5.3 Planarization
The deposited materials
were then planarized using a combination of CMP and IBE (Figure 1(3)). A short CMP
step (ωhead = 65 rpm, ωplate = 75
rpm, head pressure = 0.76 bar, polishing time = 1 min, backside pressure
= 0.76 bar, slurry 30N50 from KLEBOSOL, on a pad IC 1000 from DOW
with a specific gravity of 0.794) was used to level the wafer and
remove the excess material over the templates. Once the surface was
leveled, IBE (Veeco NEXUS IBE350, 600 W, at an incidence angle of
60 °C) was used to uniformly erode the support material until
the buried silicon template surfaced.

5.4 Membrane
Release
To release the membranes,
a combination of KOH and XeF2 etching was used (Figure 1(4)). First, the
Si3N4 backside layer was structured as the hard
mask using a standard photolithography processes (2 μm of AZ9260
as photoresist) followed by He/CHF3-based DRIE to expose
the silicon underneath. The wafer was then etched in KOH (40% at 60
°C for about 19 h) using a waterproof teflon chuck to protect
the frontside until only a few microns of silicon were left. At this
point, the wafer was diced and stored in this state until needed.
Just before use, to completely release the membranes from the last
microns of silicon and remove the sacrificial nanostructures, the
chips were etched with pulsed XeF2 gas (50 × 30 s
at 2700 mbar).

5.5 Resistivity Measurements
The membrane
tested had 441 circular nanopores of 40 nm in diameter and 630 nm
in length. The chip was placed between two separate reservoirs each
containing 850 mL of 1 m KCl (Figure 6a). A voltage was then applied across the
membrane with two Ag/AgCl electrodes fabricated by anodization of
a silver wire in 0.1 M HCl and equilibrated overnight in a solution
of 1 M KCl.
