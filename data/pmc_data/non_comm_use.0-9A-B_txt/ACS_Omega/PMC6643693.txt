Here,
we report the development of monodisperse Zn-doped iron oxide
nanoparticles (NPs) with different amounts of Zn (ZnxFe3–xO4, 0 < x < 0.43) by thermal decomposition of a mixture of zinc
and iron oleates. The as-synthesized NPs show a considerable fraction
of wüstite (FeO) which is transformed to spinel upon 2 h oxidation
of the NP reaction solutions. At any Zn doping amounts, we observed
the enrichment of the NP surface with Zn2+ ions, which
is enhanced at higher Zn loadings. Such a distribution of Zn2+ ions is attributed to the different thermal decomposition profiles
of Zn and Fe oleates, with Fe oleate decomposing at much lower temperature
than that of Zn oleate. The decomposition of Zn oleate is, in turn,
catalyzed by a forming iron oxide phase. The magnetic properties were
found to be strongly dependent on the Zn doping amounts, showing the
saturation magnetization to decrease by 9 and 20% for x = 0.05 and 0.1, respectively. On the other hand, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy near the Fermi level demonstrates that the Zn0.05Fe2.95O4 sample displays a more metallic character
(a higher charge carrier density) than undoped iron oxide NPs, supporting
its use as a spintronic material.

Introduction
Magnetic nanoparticles
(NPs), in particular doped or undoped superparamagnetic
iron oxide NPs (IONPs), receive considerable attention because of
exciting biomedical applications. IONPs are commonly recommended for
medical applications because they are easily metabolized or degraded
in vivo1,2 and FDA-approved,3 opening up numerous possibilities for their utilization in magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic particle imaging, hyperthermia,
magnetically controlled drug delivery, and so forth.4−19 In all of these cases, the higher the magnetic moment/saturation
magnetization of the material, the stronger the magnetic response
and its effects on related properties. One of the ways to increase
the saturation magnetization is to increase the IONP size, while keeping
it below the size at which the blocking temperature (TB) exceeds room temperature. TB is the temperature below which hysteresis can be observed. This
is the consequence of magnetite or maghemite NPs displaying ferrimagnetic
properties,20 making NPs prone to aggregation.
This critical size is strongly dependent on the shape and arrangement
of the NPs.19−24

Because the magnetic properties of IONPs are size-dependent,
particle
monodispersity is of crucial importance. Monodisperse IONPs are commonly
prepared by thermal decomposition of iron acetylacetonates25−27 or carboxylates27−31 in high-boiling solvents in the presence of fatty acids and/or oleylamine
as surfactants. Comparatively large IONPs (15–30 nm) can be
prepared by direct, one-pot thermal decomposition of iron oleates.28,29,32

Another viable approach
to increase magnetization is doping of
iron oxide with such metal ions as Zn2+, Co2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, and so forth.33−36 Considering that IONPs should
preserve biocompatibility for medical applications, the doped IONPs
should also be benign. Recent studies indicated that Zn-doped magnetite
NPs remain nearly nontoxic,37,38 while for other doped
IONPs, toxicology studies are scarce. The majority of Zn-doped IONPs
is synthesized by thermal decomposition of iron and zinc acetylacetonates,6 Fe(acac)3 and ZnCl2,6,34 by a cationic exchange with Zn2+ ions in IONPs,33 or by co-precipitation of corresponding metal
salts.34 This allows formation of Zn-doped
IONPs in the size range 8–19 nm. Maiti et al. reported formation
of Zn ferrite NPs by thermal decomposition of Zn and Fe oleates, but
the resultant NPs were polydisperse in size and shape.39

In addition to biomedical applications,
magnetite and doped IONPs
and thin films hold promise as spintronic materials with tunable electrical
and magnetic properties.40−45 This is due to the fact that these oxides demonstrate half metal
properties.46 While for biomedical applications
of magnetic NPs, the whole focus is on enhanced magnetization, for
spintronics, a balance of electrical conduction and magnetism is needed
which, in turn, is determined by the density and hopping amplitude
of the itinerant charge carriers in the octahedral sites of the spinel
structure.41

In this work, we studied
the formation, structure, and properties
of monodisperse Zn-doped IONPs of different compositions, whose sizes
are in the range of 16–25 nm depending on the reaction temperature
(determined by solvent choice) and whose magnetization strongly depends
on the amount of the doping metal. We demonstrate that the distribution
of Zn2+ ions in the spinel structure of NPs determines
both their magnetic and charge carrier properties. At the lowest Zn
loading, the moderate accumulation of Zn2+ ions on the
IONP surface increases the metallic character of these NPs while the
saturation magnetization is largely preserved, making them promising
as spintronic materials.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Zn-Doped IONPs
and Their Oxidation
Zn-doped
IONPs have been synthesized by thermal decomposition of a mixture
of iron (FeOl) and zinc (ZnOl) oleates at a boiling temperature of
a saturated hydrocarbon (eicosane or docosane). The transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) image of the as-synthesized sample prepared at x = 0.35 (Table 1) shows spherical monodisperse NPs with a mean diameter of
17.1 nm (Figure 1a).
The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) pattern of the same sample (Figure 1b) reveals that the
NPs consist of mainly wüstite (FeO) with a small fraction of
magnetite (Fe3O4), similar to undoped NPs prepared
solely from iron oleate.32 It was demonstrated
that FeO or FeO/Fe3O4 NPs can be successfully
oxidized to Fe3O4 or a mixture of Fe3O4 and γ-Fe2O3 by simple heating
of the reaction solution at 200 °C for 2 h.47,48 This results in a minor increase of the diameter (to 17.3 nm, Table 1) of the monodisperse
NPs (standard deviation of ∼5%) (Figure 1c) and the formation of the cubic spinel
structure (JCPDS 77-1545) as can be seen from the XRD pattern of the
oxidized sample (Figure 1d). The crystallite size determined using the Scherrer equation is
14.3 nm, indicating that the NPs are not single crystals. When eicosane
was replaced with docosane (set reaction temperature was 380 °C),
the NP size increased to 25.5 nm with a NP size distribution of 5.4%
(Figure S1, the Supporting Information).
For the sake of comparison, we synthesized all other samples in eicosane
at otherwise identical conditions to obtain similar particle sizes
(Table 1). In the following
sections, only oxidized Zn-doped IONPs will be discussed.

Structure of Zn-Doped IONPs
The
absence of an additional
ZnO phase for Zn-doped IONPs suggests that the Zn2+ ions
are incorporated in the spinel phase. A closer look at the (311) reflection
in the XRD patterns of undoped and Zn-doped IONPs with x = 0.1 and 0.19 (Table 1) shows that it is slightly shifted to smaller angles (Figure S2, Supporting Information), which could be attributed
to the substitution of Fe3+ (ionic radius of 0.49 nm) ions
in tetrahedral sites of the IONP spinel structure by Zn2+ (ionic radius of 0.74 nm).49 The high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) image presented in Figure S3 Supporting Information shows that the NPs are highly crystalline although
they are not single crystals, which is in agreement with the XRD data.

Figure 2 displays
the scanning TEM (STEM) dark-field image and energy dispersive spectroscopy
(EDS) maps of Zn0.35Fe2.65O4 (Table 1). The maps show that
Zn, Fe, and O are present in the Zn-doped IONPs and Zn exhibits a
higher abundance in the NP exterior.

Magnetic Properties
Magnetic measurements
were performed
to evaluate the magnetic behavior of these Zn-doped IONPs. Figure 3 shows the isothermal
magnetization curves at 300 K and zero-field cooling (ZFC) and FC
magnetization curves for undoped IONPs and Zn0.05Fe2.95O4 NPs. ZFC–FC curves permit obtaining
the blocking temperature, TB, the point
where the two curves merge.50 For both
samples, TB is about 270 K (Table 2), which is representative of
superparamagnetic IONPs of a similar size.51 This agrees well with the zero coercive field at 300 K, compared
to the value of a several hundred Oe observed at 5 K, as is shown
by zoomed in isothermal magnetization curves at 5 and 300 K (Figure
S4, Supporting Information).

b Saturation magnetization at 300
K at the magnetic field strength of 10 kOe.

c Normalized saturation magnetization
adjusted for 17 nm NPs.

The data presented in Table 2 reveal that with the increase of the Zn loading first the
saturation magnetization slightly increases at x =
0.05 and then significantly decreases when x >
0.1.
However, a closer look at the Table 2 data reveals that the NP sizes are slightly different.
To account for the differences in the NP sizes, we normalized saturation
magnetization values by obtaining a magnetization per nm of the NP
diameter and then multiplying this value by 17 to obtain a size normalized
value for 17 nm NPs. These data show that even at x = 0.05, the saturation magnetization drops compared to that of undoped
IONPs.

Szczerba et al. reported an increase in the saturation
magnetization
upon Zn doping up to x = 0.5; however, the NP synthesis
(co-precipitation) resulted in polydisperse, partially aggregated
NPs, creating too many variables for unambiguous conclusions.34 Jang et al. observed an increase of the saturation
magnetization up to x = 0.4, and a further decrease
for x = 0.8, explaining it by the dominant antiferromagnetic
coupling between Fe3+ ions at the higher Zn2+ doping.52 At low Zn doping amounts, two
Fe3+ ions may be located in the octahedral sites (B sublattice)
of spinel ZnFe2O4, while Zn2+ ions
could occupy the tetrahedral sites (A sublattice), thus preventing
antiferromagnetic coupling between two Fe3+ ions.49 However, for higher Zn2+ contents,
Zn2+ ions occupy the octahedral sites and then the magnetization
of the samples decreases. In the other work on Zn-doped IONP clusters,
the magnetization enhancement was only noticed for x = 0.1 and x = 0.2, while for x = 0.3, the saturation magnetization was nearly the same as that
for undoped IONP clusters.53 Similarly,
the highest magnetization was observed at x = 0.16
for Zn-doped IONPs prepared via biosynthesis54 or at x = 0.11 for Zn-doped maghemite NPs.55

On the other hand, epitaxial ZnxFe3–xO4 thin films grown in
pure Ar atmospheres demonstrated a decrease in saturation magnetization
with increasing “x” even at the smallest
Zn contents.41 The authors believe that
in this case, Zn2+ ions also substitute Fe3+ ions in tetrahedral sites, disrupting antiferromagnetic coupling
in the A sublattice which was expected to increase magnetization.
However, the simultaneous decrease of antiferromagnetic superexchange
interactions between the Fe3+ ions in tetrahedral and octahedral
sites via oxygen ions makes the ferromagnetic double exchange weaker,
competing with the antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction in
the octahedral sites.41 Considering that
in our case, normalization has been performed and we decoupled the
possible NP size influence from the influence of the Zn-doped IONP
structure and composition, and the decrease of the saturation magnetization
with increasing “x” is validated and
can be explained by the reasoning suggested in ref (41).

Ion Distribution by XPS
To assess the oxidation state
of metals and the distribution of metal species, XPS data for these
samples have been recorded. The survey XPS spectrum of the Zn-doped
iron oxide with the Zn fraction x = 0.35 is presented
in Figure S5 Supporting Information. Similar
survey spectra were obtained for the other samples studied. The survey
spectra demonstrate the presence of Zn, Fe, O, and C (both from the
surfactant and adventitious). No other elements were recorded, indicating
purity of the sample. HR XPS of Zn 2p and Fe 2p regions are presented
in Figure 4. In all
samples, the HR Zn 2p XPS spectra display a peak with a binding energy
(BE) of 1021.9 eV, which is representative of Zn2+ (Figure 4b).56 The HR Fe 2p XPS spectra are also alike and display a peak
with the BE of 711.4 eV, which is characteristic of iron oxides (Figure 4a). A satellite normally
observed for Fe3+ ions at the 8–9 eV BE greater
than the main peak is not showing. This satellite indicates the Fe3+ ions in excess of the Fe3+/Fe2+ =
2:1 ratio of magnetite.57−59 The absence of this satellite
is indicative of Fe3O4.60 There is a weak satellite feature in the HR XPS Fe 2p of undoped
IONPs (Figure S8, Supporting Information), indicating the excess of Fe3+ species beyond the Fe3+/Fe2+ = 2:1 ratio of magnetite.57−59 This observation
reveals the presence of maghemite on the NP surface. When Zn2+ ions are incorporated, they apparently replace the extra Fe3+ ions.

Figure 4 HR XPS Fe 2p (a) and Zn 2p (b) spectra of Zn0.35Fe2.65O4.

The elemental composition of the Zn-doped IONPs has been
evaluated
for 2p and 3p electrons. It is well-established that the kinetic energy
of 3p electrons is much greater than that of 2p electrons, allowing
probing the NP surface with 2p electrons and subsurface layers with
higher energy 3p electrons.61,62 The XPS data presented
in Table 2 show that
the NP surface of all samples is enriched with Zn, compared to the
subsurface layers. For the Zn0.19Fe2.81O4 sample, the bulk values of the Zn and Fe contents obtained
from inductively coupled plasma (ICP) are 3.6 and 52.01 wt %, respectively,
producing the Fe/Zn weight ratio of 14.45. For 2p and 3p electrons
(from XPS), this ratio is 3.22 and 5.34, respectively. This finding
further confirms the surface enrichment with Zn. This was surprising
considering that both oleates were loaded at the same time at the
beginning of the reaction. It is possible that iron oleate (FeOl)
decomposes at a lower temperature than zinc oleate (ZnOl), leading
to the surface enrichment with Zn.

Thermal Properties of Oleates
To test this hypothesis,
we carried out thermal gravimetric analyses (TGAs) and differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) of zinc and iron oleates at 3 °C/min
(similar to the reaction conditions) as well as their mixture matching
the oleate loading for x = 0.35 (Figure 5). Weight loss of 5%, corresponding
to the beginning of precursor decomposition, occurs at 240, 313, and
216 °C for FeOl, ZnOl, and the mixture, respectively. At ∼340
°C (the reaction temperature in eicosane), ZnOl decomposition
is barely noticeable, becoming more pronounced at ∼390 °C.
The DSC trace of ZnOl shows a sharp endothermic transition at 92 °C,
which is assigned to melting of the hydrophobic tail ordering in ZnOl.63 The endothermic transition assigned to the ZnOl
decomposition is hardly noticeable at 390 °C.63 It is noteworthy that the ZnOl decomposition carried out
in the reaction conditions (∼340 °C) produces no ZnO NPs
(see Figure S6, Supporting Information).
At the same time, Zn-doped IONPs contain considerable amounts of Zn,
revealing that IONPs formed early in the decomposition process catalyze
the ZnOl decomposition. A similar catalyzing effect in the presence
of magnetite NPs was observed for Cr acetylacetonate, whose decomposition
does not occur at the reaction temperature in the absence of iron
oxide.64 Moreover, in the case of the ZnOl
+ FeOl mixture, the weight loss begins at the lowest temperature (Figure 5a) and the endothermic
peaks assigned to the monomer formation (at about 230 °C) and
its decomposition (at about 320 °C) (Figure 5b) are shifted to lower temperatures than
those for iron oleate, indicating that the presence of Zn2+ ions accelerates transformations of FeOl, while the formation of
IONPs catalyzes the ZnOl decomposition, creating a gradient in the
Zn2+ ion distribution.

Figure 5 TGA (a) and DSC (b) curves of FeOl, ZnOl,
and their mixture (x = 0.35).

Charge Carrier Transport and Zn2+ Ion Distribution
Table 2 data show
that the normalized magnetization decreases by ∼9% for x = 0.05, ∼20% for x = 0.1, and
then plummets by more than half starting from x =
0.19. It is expected that a change (increase/decrease) of magnetization
should correlate with the carrier density and subsequently with the
increase of conductivity. It has been shown that thermally activated
itinerant t2g electrons facilitate (through the hopping
mechanism between Fe2+/Fe3+ ions of the B sublattice)
electrical conductivity and influence the magnetic properties of ZnxFe3–xO4.41 A photoemission study of the
ZnxFe3–xO4 film revealed that an increase of substituted Fe3+ ions by Zn2+ or Mn2+ significantly
decreases the density of states (DOS) at the vicinity of the Fermi
level, leading finally (at x = 1) to gap opening.65 In order to determine whether there is a correlation
between the magnetic and electronic properties of the IONPs upon Zn
doping, we studied the valence band (VB) using XPS for x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.35. Figure 6 demonstrates that the DOS near the Fermi level first
significantly increases at x = 0.05 and then drops
at x = 0.1 below the level of the undoped IONPs.
The observed DOS increase at x = 0.05 is consistent
with the increase of a high spin fraction of the electronic system.
This is also evident in the Fe 2p core and Fe 3p shallow core level
evolution, while resulting in the increased Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio (Figure S7, Supporting Information). Liu et al. reported a similar behavior at very low doping level
and attributed it to Zn2+ ions initially occupying the
A site.53 However, when the A site is saturated,
the Zn2+ ions start occupying the high spin B site. A further
increase of the doping level (x = 0.35) does not
significantly affect the density of the electron population at the
Fermi level (Figure S8, Supporting Information), keeping it at the level of undoped IONPs. This observation is
consistent with the photoemission data obtained for ZnxFe3–xO4 films,65 where the lowest doping level
was x = 0.5. A comparison of our data with standard
iron oxides (Figure S9 and the text underneath, Supporting Information) shows similar DOS values.

Figure 6 VB XPS
spectra of ZnxFe3–xO4 NPs at x = 0.00, 0.05,
and 0.1 at hν = 1486.6 eV.

These data demonstrate that for Zn-doped IONPs studied here,
the
normalized saturation magnetization values do not correlate with the
initial DOS trend. For x = 0.05, the DOS is the highest
while the saturation magnetization is only slightly lower than that
for undoped IONPs. For the high doping level (x =
0.35), there is a correlation between the low magnetization and DOS,
but for undoped IONPs, the DOS is as low as that for x = 0.35, but the magnetization is the highest. To better understand
such behavior, we further analyzed the Zn and Fe contents on the NP
surface and subsurface. The Fe 2p/Zn 2p ratio is 28.4 for x = 0.05, 5.5 for x = 0.1, and then further
decreases to 4 and 3 for x = 0.19 and x = 0.35, respectively. In subsurface layers, the Fe 3p/Zn 3p ratio
changes from 99 to 37.5 to 13.5 and to 9.8 for x =
0.05, 0.1, 0.19, and 0.35, respectively. These data indicate that
the dependence upon doping is nonlinear and the most dramatic change
in the surface and subsurface composition occurs between the samples
obtained at x = 0.05 and x = 0.1,
while at further doubling of Zn loading (x = 0.19)
the changes are less prominent.

Our observations indicate that
the DOS is strongly influenced by
the Zn2+ ion distribution/accumulation on the IONP surface.
When the Zn2+ ion loading is low and the Zn2+ ions are sparsely distributed in the IONP surface lattice, they
substitute mainly Fe3+ surface ions in the A sites49 and do not interfere or rather enhance the charge
carriers density at the B sites, resulting in the highest DOS near
the Fermi level. This should correlate with an increase of the magnetization,
but we do not observe such a correlation. If the initial occupation
of the A site for Zn2+ is preferred, then according to
Neel’s model,66 diamagnetic Zn2+ ions would not affect magnetization by merely their presence.
Nevertheless, after doping, a decrease of the occupation fraction
of Fe3+ at the A site would reduce the magnetic moment
of the A site and consequently increase the net magnetization. To
explain the observed monotonic reduction of magnetization, an additional
effect leading to a simultaneous decrease of the magnetic moment of
the B site needs to be introduced. The spin canting in the B sublattice67 could be a reason or an effect of antiphase
boundaries (APB) reported for films;68,69 however, APB
free films have been reported as well.41 Although the APB effect might be negligible for high quality thin
films, it might significantly affect magnetic properties of NPs.

The further accumulation of Zn2+ ions on the NP surface
results in disrupting hopping mechanism between Fe2+/Fe3+ ions of the B sublattice, leading to the decreasing DOS.
Thus, Zn doping allows tuning of the charge carrier density and influences
both the conductivity and the saturation magnetization.

Conclusions
We synthesized monodisperse Zn-doped IONPs of different compositions
and studied their structure and properties. The IONP sizes were in
the range of 16–25 nm depending on the reaction conditions,
with IONP size distributions not exceeding 6%. Using XPS and EDS,
we discovered a radial Zn2+ ion distribution, with significant
Zn2+ ion enrichment on the IONP surface. Such species distribution
was attributed to the different decomposition patterns of Zn and Fe
oleates, as was shown by TGA and DSC. It was demonstrated that Zn
oleate does not decompose at the reaction temperature (∼340
°C), while the mixture of Zn and Fe oleates decomposes at even
lower temperature than Fe oleate, revealing a mutual influence of
Zn2+ and forming IONPs on the decomposition process. The
XPS data at the Fermi level demonstrated that at the low Zn loading,
the moderate accumulation of Zn2+ ions on the IONP surface
increases the DOS, that is, the metallic character of these NPs with
a largely preserved saturation magnetization, making them promising
for spintronics applications.

Synthesis of Oleate Precursors
FeOl
was synthesized
according to a published procedure.29 For
ZnOl synthesis, zinc chloride (2.17 g, 0.016 mol) and sodium oleate
(9.67 g, 0.032 mol) were added to a mixture of ethanol (16 mL), hexane
(28 mL), and water (37 mL) and left to react for 4 h at 70 °C
under stirring. Upon cooling, a white powder formed which was separated
by centrifugation and washed with 15 mL ethanol five times following
centrifugation and supernatant removal each time. Subsequently, the
product was dried under vacuum for 24 h at room temperature. Elemental
analysis data (from X-ray fluorescence and combustion) (wt %) found:
C, 68.95; O, 9.85; H, 10.56; Zn, 10.64. Calcd (ZnC36H66O4): C, 68.97; O, 10.22; H, 10.53; Zn, 10.44.

Synthesis of Undoped and Zn-Doped IONPs
IONPs were
prepared via the thermal decomposition of FeOl in eicosane or docosane.32,48 In a typical experiment, a three-neck round-bottom flask furnished
with a reflux condenser, a magnetic stir bar, and two septa was loaded
with 1.66 g of FeOl, 1.69 mL of oleic acid (3 mmol), and 6.48 g of
eicosane. One septum contained a temperature probe inserted in a glass
shield and through the other a long needle was inserted. The flask
mounted in the heating mantel connected to a temperature controller
was degassed three times using evacuation and filling with argon cycles
and left under argon. The reaction mixture was then heated to 60 °C
and kept at this temperature for 30 min to allow dissolution of the
reagents in the melted solvent. After that the flask was heated with
a heating rate of 2.2 °C/min to a boiling temperature (∼340
°C) and was allowed to reflux for 30 min. The flask was cooled
to 50 °C to keep the reaction solution liquid. The needed amount
was precipitated by a mixture of hexane/acetone = 1:5 (v/v) and then
washed once with the same mixture and twice with a hexane/acetone
= 1:3 (v/v) mixture using centrifugation to separate the precipitate
from supernatant. Finally, the precipitate was dispersed in chloroform.
The NPs obtained were kept as solid reaction solutions until needed.
Oxidation of as-synthesized NPs was performed following the procedure
described elsewhere.47,48 The reaction conditions for all
the samples are summarized in Table 1. Because FeOl is a viscous oil, it was weighed first
directly into the reaction flask, while the amounts of all other reagents
were adjusted to keep the same ratio of metal oleates to oleic acid
and the same concentration.

Zn-doped IONPs were synthesized
similarly by adding required amounts of ZnOl (Table 1) to the reaction mixture. The rest of the
procedure was the same as for IONP above.

Characterization
TEM was utilized for imaging of all
samples. To prepare an electron-transparent NP sample, a drop of a
chloroform solution was placed on a carbon-coated Cu grid. Images
were obtained on a JEOL JEM 1010 transmission electron microscope
at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. HRTEM and STEM EDS images and
maps were attained on a JEOL 3200FS transmission electron microscope
with attached an Oxford Instruments INCA EDS system at an accelerating
voltage of 300 kV.

XRD patterns were acquired using an Empyrean
diffractometer (PANalytical). X-rays were produced from a copper target
with a wavelength Cu Kα of 1.54187 Å. Soller, antiscatter,
and divergence slits as well as a nickel filter were in the beam path.
The sample was spinning with a revolution time of 4 s during the measurement
in reflection mode. The measurements were carried out with several
step-sizes and counting rates.70

Elemental analysis of Fe and Zn oleates was carried out with an
X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (Zeiss Jena VRA-30) furnished with
a Mo anode, a LiF crystal analyzer, and an SZ detector. The Fe Kα
and Zn Kα lines were used for analyses. Standards have been
prepared by mixing 1 g of polystyrene with 10–20 mg of standard
compounds.71 The time of data acquisition
was constant at 10 s. Carbon and hydrogen contents were determined
by a combustion analysis.

The Zn and Fe contents in Zn0.19Fe2.81O4 were measured using ICP–optical
emission spectroscopy
(NexION 300Q, PerkinElmer).

XPS experiments were carried out
on the PHI VersaProbe II instrument
equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα source. The X-ray power
of 25 W at 15 kV was utilized for a 200 μm beam size. The calibration
of the instrument work function was performed to produce a BE of 84.0
eV for the Au 4f7/2 line for metallic gold and the spectrometer
dispersion was tuned to produce BEs of 284.8 eV, 932.7 eV and of 368.3
eV for the C 1s line of adventitious (aliphatic) carbon present on
the non-sputtered samples, Cu 2p3/2 and Ag 3d5/2 photoemission lines, respectively.72 The
PHI dual charge compensation system was utilized on all samples. The
final VersaProbe II instrumental resolution was found to be better
than 0.125 eV using the Fermi edge of the VB for metallic silver.
XPS spectra with the energy step of 0.1 eV were recorded with SmartSoft-XPS
v2.0 and processed using PHI MultiPack v9.0 software at pass energies
of 46.95 and 23.5 eV for Fe 2p, 93.5 eV for Zn 2p, 23.5 eV for C 1s,
VB and Fe 3p. Peaks were fitted utilizing a combination of Gaussians
and Lorentzians with 10–50% of Lorentzian contents. Curve-fitting
was carried out using a Shirley background. The samples for XPS measurements
were prepared by drop casting of the NP solution onto the native surface
of a Si(111) wafer.73 The standards Fe2O3, Fe3O4, and FeO powders
were commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich.

Thermal properties
of the oleate precursors to Zn-doped IONPs were
evaluated by TGA and DSC. TGA was performed on a Setaram Labsys evo
STA 1600 instrument using alumina crucibles. DSC was analyzed on a
TA Q200 analyzer with an RCS 90 cooling system using aluminum Tzero
pans. All experiments were performed under an argon atmosphere while
heating at 3 K/min.

The magnetic properties of the samples were
acquired by a Superconducting
Quantum Interference Device magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS XL5).
The measurements have been carried out using dried NPs on cotton placed
in a gelatin capsule. The isothermal hysteresis loops, M(H), were measured at fields −1 ≤ H ≤ +1 T. The dc magnetic susceptibility as a function
of temperature, M(T), was achieved
down to 5 K using ZFC and FC protocols, at H = 50
Oe.21
