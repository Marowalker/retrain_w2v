Highly oriented,
multilayer molecular films of picene and dinaphtho[2,3-b:2′,3′-f]thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DNTT) molecules with the long axis parallel
to the substrate (parallel configuration, hereafter) were fabricated
on their characteristic bulklike monolayer. These molecules form a
dense monolayer with a bulklike molecular arrangement on metal surfaces
such as Au(111), which allows further stacking of parallel molecules.
Indeed, upon adsorption of picene and DNTT on these dense monolayers,
growth of straight islands of multilayer without the dendritic layer
was observed. Particularly, in the case of picene, one-dimensional
islands with lengths over 100 μm were formed and aligned in
3-fold symmetric directions of the substrate, which was not observed
in the case of DNTT. X-ray diffraction measurements revealed the presence
of [201̅] and [211̅] planes and the absence of the [001]
diffractions, indicating that the one-dimensional islands of picene
indeed consist of parallel molecules. The formation of huge crystalline
islands in the case of picene, in contrast to the case of DNTT, is
likely induced by the stronger intermolecular force, as suggested
from the calculation of the vibrational energy.

1 Introduction
Small organic semiconductors
with enhanced intermolecular interaction,
such as phenacenes and thienoacenes, have been attracting attention
because high-quality single crystals or thin films are expected. In
this study, we focused on picene and dinaphtho[2,3-b:2′,3′-f]thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DNTT) (as shown in the insets of Figure 1a,d) as model molecules of phenacenes and
thienoacenes, respectively. Indeed, the single-crystalline picene
shows significant dispersion of the highest occupied molecular orbital,1,2 and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) utilizing the single-crystalline
picene exhibit high carrier mobility of more than 1 cm2 V–1 s–1.3 Theoretical calculations have suggested that the single-crystalline
picene can exhibit a maximum mobility up to 2.6 cm2 V–1 s–1 along the π–π
stacking direction.4 OFETs based on single-crystalline
DNTT have shown mobility as high as 10 cm2 V–1 s–1.5 However, OFETs
utilizing the thin films of these molecules have exhibited much lower
hole mobility, such as 0.1–0.3 cm2 V–1 s–1 for picene6 and
2.9 cm2 V–1 s–1 for
DNTT.7 These facts suggest that further
optimization of the thin-film structure of these organic semiconductors
is required.

f) STM images of the DNTT monolayer on the Au(111) substrate.

There have been common problems
in the growth of the multilayer
film of these π-conjugated planar molecules; the monolayers
of these molecules on the flat substrates usually take a “flat-lying”
or “face-on” conformation due to significant coupling
between π orbital of molecules and the surface electronic states,
whereas the second layer does not usually follow the configuration
of the monolayers and tends to “stand up”. This mechanism
usually leads to a dendritic growth of the multilayer with a complicated
morphology and small domain sizes.8−11 Even in the case of a carefully
optimized deposition utilizing the supersonic molecular beam deposition
of picene, the reported grain size of the film is in the range of
several micrometers.12 We focus here on
the morphology of the monolayer, which is known to be one of the key
features determining the structure of multilayer films of organic
semiconductors.13 We have recently reported
that the careful deposition of picene and DNTT on flat surfaces can
form a corrugated monolayer in which half of the molecules take a
“side-on” geometry.14 The
same growth feature can also be seen in other phenacenes.15 The molecular ordering of the monolayer resembles
the (110) plane of the bulk crystal, although they are not identical,
which is distinct from the case of the similar π-conjugated
molecules such as pentacene, and this phenomenon should reflect the
strong intermolecular interaction of these molecules. The bulklike
monolayers could be useful for further stacking of parallel molecules
on it, which can potentially yield a high-quality multilayer film.

Therefore, in this work, we have tried to grow the multilayer picene
and DNTT on their peculiar monolayer. We indeed demonstrated here
that the careful fabrication of the bulklike monolayers and further
slow deposition of molecules resulted in formation of extremely long
(more than 100 μm in the case of picene) and unidirectional
islands consisting of parallel molecules. We will emphasize that much
better crystalline films have been realized using picenes in comparison
with DNTT. The superior growth found in picene films may be attributed
to the stronger intermolecular force constant, as suggested from the
analysis of the normal vibrational modes of the single-crystalline
structure of these molecules. We note here that, upon the submission
of the present article, we have been aware of the demonstration of
the same strategy by Dreher et al. for the case of DNTT,16 reporting consistent results with those discussed
in the present work. The growth of the parallel molecules, which is
particularly efficient for small molecules with enhanced intermolecular
interaction such as phenacenes, will be beneficial not only for the
applications in organic electronics devices but also in the basic
research of the structure–function relationship of organic
semiconductors.

2 Experimental and Theoretical
Methods
Single-crystalline Au(111) was used as a substrate.
The substrate
was cleaned by several cycles of Ar+ ion sputtering followed
by annealing at approximately 400 °C. The cleanliness of the
substrate was examined by low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with a constant current mode.
Sharp diffraction spots and herringbone reconstruction17 of the Au(111) substrates were clearly observed
by LEED and STM images. The deposition of picene and DNTT molecules
on the clean Au(111) substrate was performed in an ultrahigh vacuum
(UHV) environment of about 1 × 1010 Torr with a homemade
Knudsen cell, which allows a slow deposition rate of approximately
1 ML/1000 s at room temperature to ensure good crystallinity of the
resultant film. The deposition rate was monitored by a quartz crystal
microbalance. The distance from the molecule evaporator to the Au(111)
substrate was 35 cm. The formation of monolayers of picene and DNTT
was confirmed by LEED and STM observation. After that, the multilayers
of picene and DNTT were deposited on the well-ordered monolayer at
the same rate in UHV. Structural measurements of the multilayer were
performed ex situ at room temperature. The morphology of the multilayer
was observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) conducted in the tapping
mode under atmospheric pressure and an optical microscope (OM). Crystallographic
phase and molecular orientation in the film were characterized by
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement, which was performed by a Cu Kα
source X-ray of λ = 0.15406 nm. The normal vibrational modes
of the crystal are obtained from the dynamical matrix constructed
by the force field MMFF94s18 using the
CONFLEX code.22 Here, the optimization
process starts with the experimental structure, and the atomic positions
are optimized at fixed lattice constants.

3 Results
and Discussion
First, we confirmed the formation of characteristic
corrugated
monolayers of picene and DNTT on a clean Au(111) substrate. It was
seen that the picene and DNTT molecules adsorb in the flat-lying geometry
at low coverage, whereas the geometry transforms into a corrugated
arrangement near the monolayer coverage.14Figure 1b,e shows
the monolayer structure of picene and DNTT on Au(111). As seen in
the magnified STM image in Figure 1c,f, the molecules in the monolayer show corrugated
arrangements with the unit cell sizes of 1.1 × 1.4 nm2 for picene and 1.1 × 1.6 nm2 for DNTT. For both
molecules, it was found that the molecular rows (defined with black
arrows in the STM images) of the dense phase were aligned along the
symmetric ⟨11̅0⟩ direction of the substrate. Thus,
there were three rotational domains, which were rotated by 120°
from each other. The molecular arrangements and the sizes of the unit
cells of the corrugated phases of picene and DNTT are apparently similar
to the (110) planes of their single crystals (as illustrated in Figure 1a and d, respectively)
although they are not identical. The formation of this type of bulklike
monolayer seems to be common for phenacene or thienoacene, with enhanced
intermolecular interaction.19,20

The dense monolayers
of picene and DNTT with bulklike molecular
arrangement as discussed above are promising for enhanced stacking
of further molecules in a similar fashion. Therefore, we further deposited
the multilayer of picene onto the dense monolayer and observed an
abrupt growth of large and straight islands of the multilayer. These
islands became so large that they could be clearly seen even with
an optical microscope (OM). The OM images of the surface with low
and high coverage of the picene islands prepared with the slow deposition
of approximately 20 and 70 ML of picene molecules on the dense monolayer
are shown in Figure 2a and b, respectively. In the image of the 20 ML coverage, Figure 2a, the formation
of the rodlike picene crystalline islands with sharp edges is seen.
The typical length, width, and height of the rod are approximately
30 μm, 0.5 μm, and 150 nm, respectively. It was clearly
observed that the rods tend to align along three particular directions.
The three directions, marked with arrows in Figure 2a, were found to correspond to the three
domains of molecular rows of the monolayer on the Au(111) substrate,21 that is, the ⟨11̅0⟩ direction.
On increasing the coverage of molecules, as shown in Figure 2b, large-scale crystalline
islands with a length of much more than 100 μm were obtained.
At the same time, the domain with the aligned islands became as large
as 0.5 mm. Figure 2c shows the AFM topography of the top surface of the crystalline
picene island, where a step-terrace-like structure was observed. However,
most of the steps were with a height of more than 5 nm, as shown in
the line scan A in Figure 2c,d, much larger than a single molecular step, possibly due
to bunching of the steps. In addition, the terrace morphology was
found to be corrugated with amplitude of several nanometers as shown
in the line scan B in Figure 2e. It is noted that the AFM measurements were conducted after
taking the sample out to the atmospheric environment from a UHV; therefore,
some distortion of the crystal surface, such as dewetting or disordering
due to water coadsorption, may have occurred in this process. We note
here that the structure of the monolayer was not changed on increasing
the coverage of the molecule. Therefore, crystalline islands seem
to form directly on the monolayer without the wetting layer.

microscope pictures of picene thin films with thicknesses
of 20 and 70 ML, respectively; (c) AFM topography of the picene crystalline
island. (d, e) Height profile along the scanning line A and line B
of the AFM image.

We also examined the
thicker film of DNTT on its bulklike monolayer. Figure 3a shows the OM image
of the DNTT thin film with the molecular coverage of 30 ML. Although
we observed formation of similar islands with the height of 130 nm
(as shown in the line scan in Figure 3c,d) as in the case of picene, their sizes were relatively
smaller and the tendency of the alignment of the islands with respect
to the substrate was also weaker. At the higher coverage of 70 ML,
as shown in Figure 3b, we found a network structure of the island with typical length
of several micrometers, which was distinct from the case of the high-coverage
picene (Figure 2b).
From the AFM image shown in Figure 3c, the surface of the DNTT crystal island is rather
rough. These results are consistent with the recent work of Dreher
et al.16

DNTT thin film with coverages
of 30 and 70 ML, respectively; (c) AFM topography of the DNTT crystalline
island. (d) Height profile along the scanning line B of (c).

We then analyzed the molecular
orientation of the crystalline picene
film by means of XRD measurements. Figure 4a displays the spectrum of the θ/2θ
scan without subtraction of the background signal of an Au substrate.
Within the analyzed angular range of 5–30°, two obvious
diffraction peaks were observed at 2θ = 22.1° and 2θ
= 26.4°. These peaks are assigned to be due to (201̅) and
(211̅) planes, respectively, in comparison with the powder spectra
(Figure 4b). The schematic
images of molecular arrangements of the (201̅) and (211̅)
planes are illustrated in Figure 4c, which reveals a characteristic orientation of molecules
with the long axes parallel to the surface (parallel molecule). Note
that the molecular arrangements in the (201̅) and (211̅)
planes are not identical to the monolayer. This implies that, although
the bulklike monolayer can facilitate the further stacking of the
parallel molecules, the template effect of the monolayer is not strong
enough to realize epitaxial growth of the overlayer. In the case of
DNTT, as revealed by the work of Dreher et al., the DNTT island showed
a (121̅) plane in the XRD spectrum, which also shows a similar
but distinct molecular arrangement from its monolayer.

spectrum of the picene powder performed by the CCSD software package.
(c) Model of molecular arrangements of the (201̅) and (211̅)
planes of the bulk picene crystal.

Although we demonstrated that both picene and DNTT can form
the
crystalline islands with parallel molecules, that of picene showed
a higher degree of homogeneity of each island, strict orientation
with respect to the substrate, and a tendency to form larger domains
with single orientation of crystalline islands. Although a microscopic
understanding of the crystallization mechanism is still a difficult
issue, the different behavior between two molecules may be attributable
to the difference in the intermolecular interactions. As the measure
of the intermolecular force constant, we examined the vibrational
energy of the translational modes with the molecular displacement
in the direction of the van der Waals bonding, in the case of the
single-crystalline picene and DNTT. Figure 5 shows the translational optic phonon modes
at the Γ point, in which the displacements of atoms (indicated
by red arrows) are mainly along the π-stacking direction of
two adjacent molecules in the a–b plane of the single crystal. The vibrational energies of such modes
in the case of picene and DNTT were found to be 10.61 and 8.638 meV,
respectively, as indicated in the figure. From the energy of the vibrational
modes and masses of the molecule (picene: 2.78 × 10–1 kg mol–1; DNTT: 3.40 × 10–1 kg mol–1), we estimated the force constant of
the intermolecular van der Waals bonding, simply assuming the harmonic
oscillation, deducing 30.1 kg s–2 for picene and
24.3 kg s–2 for DNTT. Thus, the π–π
interaction in picene is found to be stronger than that of DNTT, possibly
resulting in the better crystalline morphology of the multilayer.
However, since the molecular growth can depend on many other parameters,
further detailed examination will surely be required.

modes in the parallel ab plane of the DNTT dimer
of its bulk phase unit cell. (b) Molecular
vibration modes in the parallel ab plane of the picene
dimer of its bulk phase unit cell. The parameters below the figures
indicate their corresponding vibrational energy.

It is also noted that the similar straight islands of pentacene
and quaterphenyl were previously found on the metal substrate.13,23 However, the size of the islands was much smaller than the case
of picene or DNTT. This difference is attributable to the difference
in the structure of the monolayer, that is, the monolayer of pentacene
consists of flat-lying molecules, in contrast to the case of molecules
examined in the present study. The characteristic shape of the monolayer
with a bulklike molecular arrangement can therefore be considered
to stabilize the upper layer with the parallel molecules.

This
crystalline film with parallel molecules may exhibit an enhanced
π-stacking, and thus it will be beneficial not only for applications
in organic electronics, but also for basic research of the structure–property
relationships of these types of organic semiconductors.

4 Conclusions
We fabricated well-defined crystalline films
of picene and DNTT
on their well-ordered monolayers with a bulklike molecular arrangement.
By means of slow deposition of the multilayer on the bulklike monolayer,
large-scale crystalline islands having lengths of several hundred
micrometers were obtained, especially in the case of picene. XRD measurement
revealed that picene crystals consist of planes of (201̅) and
(211̅), clearly suggesting that the film consists of the parallel
molecules which may be stabilized by the peculiar structure of the
monolayer.
