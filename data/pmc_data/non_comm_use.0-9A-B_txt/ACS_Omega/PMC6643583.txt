Different
signal
amplification strategies to improve the detection sensitivity of immunoassays
have been applied which utilize enzymatic reactions, nanomaterials,
or liposomes. The latter are very attractive materials for signal
amplification because liposomes can be loaded with a large amount
of signaling molecules, leading to a high sensitivity. In addition,
liposomes can be used as a cell-like “bioscaffold” to
directly test recognition schemes aiming at cell-related processes.
This study demonstrates an easy and fast approach to link the novel
hydrophobic optical probe based on [1,3]dioxolo[4,5-f]-[1,3]benzodioxole (DBD dye mm239) with tunable optical properties
to hydrophilic recognition
elements (e.g., antibodies) using liposomes for signal amplification
and as carrier of the hydrophobic dye. The fluorescence properties
of mm239 (e.g., long fluorescence lifetime, large Stokes shift, high
photostability, and high quantum yield), its high hydrophobicity for
efficient anchoring in liposomes, and a maleimide bioreactive group
were applied in a unique combination to build a concept for the coupling
of antibodies or other protein markers to liposomes (coupling to membranes
can be envisaged). The concept further allowed us to avoid multiple
dye labeling of the antibody. Here, anti-TAMRA-antibody (DC7-Ab) was
attached to the liposomes. In proof-of-concept, steady-state as well
as time-resolved fluorescence measurements (e.g., fluorescence depolarization)
in combination with single molecule detection (fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy, FCS) were used to analyze the binding interaction between
DC7-Ab and liposomes as well as the binding of the antigen rhodamine
6G (R6G) to the antibody. Here, the Förster resonance energy
transfer (FRET) between mm239 and R6G was monitored. In addition to
ensemble FRET data, single-molecule FRET (PIE-FRET) experiments using
pulsed interleaved excitation were used to characterize in detail
the binding on a single-molecule level to avoid averaging out effects.

Introduction
Fluorescence-based techniques are the
working horses in life sciences,
especially when it comes to optical microscopy. Here, technical developments
complemented with optimized fluorescence probes have paved the road
for the investigation of many biological processes on a (sub)cellular
level, e.g., using single-molecule spectroscopy or STED microscopy.1,2 In order to
adapt fluorescence techniques on new topics and/or to optimize them,
novel fluorescence dyes with tailored optical properties are needed.
Here, [1,3]dioxolo[4,5-f][1,3]benzodioxoles (DBD
dyes) have shown many promising properties. The photophysical
and chemical properties of the DBD dyes can be tuned (decay time,
quantum yield, spectral position of emission maximum, as well as Stokes
shift and their functional groups for bioconjugation) and can be excited
by two-photon absorption, and they show a high photochemical stability.3−5 Förster resonance
energy transfer (FRET) is a well-established concept to monitor the
binding interaction between antigen and antibody with a very high
sensitivity and is successfully applied in clinical diagnostics.6−9 DBD dyes in combination
with coumarins were also characterized with respect to FRET parameters,
with special emphasis on the orientation factor.10,11 Recently, DBD compounds have been also characterized in the context
of membrane probes.10,12 Hydrophobic motifs like oligospirothioketal
groups10 or alkyl chains12 were used as an anchor to the probes in membranes and vesicles.
The length of the anchor was also directing the DBD compound to laterally
ordered membrane domains. Due to the presence of a maleimide moiety,
further biofunctionalization, e.g., to proteins, was successfully
carried out.12

For studying and understanding
the interactions and signal pathways
on cell membranes (e.g., of receptor–ligand interactions),
liposomes are frequently used as model systems.9,13 Liposomes
can also be seen as a class nanomaterial with a surface
that can be designed to be biocompatible. They are adjustable in size,
and more importantly for the investigation of ligand–receptor
interactions their surface can be tailored (e.g., by the insertion
of proteins), mimicking certain properties of biomembranes.14−16 Liposomes form small
compartments (μm to subμm scale) consisting of a hydrophobic
bilayer with polar surfaces on
the in- and outside of the compartment. Because of these unique properties,
they are used in many different analytical methodologies.17,18 In the hydrophobic bilayer, nonpolar molecules can be trapped. In
contrast, inside the liposome, hydrophilic
compounds can be located. The combination of hydrophilic and hydrophobic
regions in a well-defined volume can be used for labeling (parts)
of the liposome and for the development of assays.19,20 A major feature of liposome-based assay formats was the potential
for signal amplification because the number of markers “hosted”
in the vesicle or on the surface of vesicles can be much higher than
the number directly conjugated to a biomolecule (e.g., antibody).
Enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assays are reported with hundreds of
enzyme molecules per vesicle yielding a significant signal amplification.21−24 Homogeneous as well
as heterogeneous assay formats using liposomes are on hand, and often
the signal enhancement is based on a liposome lysis (complement-mediated
or melittin-mediated) upon biorecognition.25,26

In our studies we used the liposomes in a 2-fold way: as a
mediator phase to directly interface conjugation of hydrophobic
biomolecules with hydrophobic probes and as a potential scheme for
signal amplification. Here, we present the first results with respect
to (i) the direct labeling of biomolecules to hydrophobic dye molecules
and (ii) the proof-of-principle for a binding interaction on the surface
of the liposomes. The hydrophobic part of the liposomes was used to
host a hydrophobic fluorophore (DBD mm239), which subsequently was
attached to an antibody. In our experiments, an antibody directed
against rhodamine (DC7-Ab) was used. An advantage of using DC7-Ab
is that rhodamine derivatives for labeling purposes of biomolecules
are commercially available, and it has therefore a broad spectrum
of possible “modified” antigens which could be disseminated
in future applications. The binding interaction of rhodamine and DC7-Ab
was characterized in detail before using fluorescence techniques with
special emphasis on Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)
to evaluate the success of the binding.27

Results and Discussion
Some spectroscopic properties of
the mm239-DTT in DMSO as well
as immobilized in liposomes are shown in Table 1 (for mm239 only and in other solvents see
ref (12)). The DBD
derivative is characterized by a large Stokes shift (Δλ
∼
90
± 5 nm) and long fluorescence lifetime (τ ∼
15 ns) in both samples.

According
to Figure 1 (left),
before the reaction with DTT, the fluorescence intensity
of mm239 dye (in liposomes) was very weak due to the quenching effect
of the maleimide group, which is a result of a photoinduced electron
transfer.12 After reaction with DTT, the
fluorescence intensity increased significantly by a factor of about
eight.

Figure 1 (left)

in DMSO and in liposome after adding DTT (λex = 375
nm, λem = 470 nm).

Like the fluorescence intensity, the fluorescence decay
kinetics
was also changed. While for mm239 in DMSO and also in liposomes a
distinct quenching (biexponential decay, see Figure 1, right) was observed, upon modification
with DTT the fluorescence
decay became monoexponential, showing a fluorescence decay time of
15 ns in liposomes (see Table 1). The long fluorescence decay time and the large Stokes shift
of about Δλ = 90 nm in combination with the DTT for further
functionalization made mm239-DTT very intriguing as an optical probe
in biosensing. However, the successful incorporation of mm239-DTT
into the liposome phase could not be concluded directly from the data.

Incorporation of DBD Dye in Liposomes
Previously, the
incorporation of mm239 into GUV membranes has been shown indirectly
by fluorescence microscopy.12 Here, additional
fluorescence depolarization experiments were performed to monitor
the incorporation of dyes (and the conjugation of antibodies to liposomes,
vide infra) directly. A full depolarization of the fluorescence was
found in DMSO, and subsequently the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy r was calculated as zero. On the other hand, in the presence
of liposomes (in PBS) the fluorescence anisotropy r increased up to r = 0.16 for mm239-DTT (Figure 2, right).

Figure 2 (left) Fluorescence
anisotropy decay of mm239-DTT in the absence
and presence of liposomes and after conjugation with DC7-Ab (λex = 375 nm, λem = 470 nm). (right) Steady
state fluorescence anisotropy of mm239-DTT in DMSO,
in the presence of liposomes, and after conjugation to DC7-Ab. Also
shown is the corresponding fluorescence excitation spectrum of mm239-DTT
(λem = 470 nm).

Complementary results from time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy
data analysis yielded, in the case of mm239-DTT in DMSO, a fast, single-exponential
decay kinetics (Figure 2, left) with a short rotational correlation time Φ = 0.3 ns,
which is typical for small organic molecules in neat solvents.28 In the presence of liposomes, the rotation of
mm239-DTT was distinctly slower (Figure 2, left). In the data analysis the “wobble-in-a-cone”
model was used.29−31 Based on this model
the rotational correlation time calculated for the anisotropy decay
kinetics increased to Φ = 1.42 ns, and a semicone angle of θk = 48° was found. The
increase of the steady-state anisotropy as well as the rotational
correlation time of the dye in the presence of liposomes showed once
more that the movement of the dye was restricted and underlined its
incorporation into the lipid phase of the liposome.

Binding of
R6G (Antigen) to Liposome-Immobilized Ab
In the next step,
the binding of an antibody (Ab) to the liposome
surface was investigated. In principle the maleimide group in DBD
derivatives could react directly with thiol groups which are frequently
present in proteins as cysteine residue under reducing conditions.
However, in the case of Ab, thiols are often found in oxidized form
as disulfide bridges which play an important role in keeping the tertiary
structure and activity of antibodies. Direct labeling would require
cleavage of disulfide bonds by using reducing agents
which in some cases cause the loss of Ab activity. Instead, in this
study an indirect labeling using dual functional cross-linker SMPH
was applied, which also aimed to increase the efficiency of
the conjugation of the Ab to the liposome because the distance to
the liposome surface was enlarged this way (see Figure 7). The successful binding of the DC7-Ab to
the liposome loaded with mm239-DTT was tested in fluorescence depolarization
experiments (see Figure 2). For liposomes after conjugation with DC7-Ab the fluorescence anisotropy r of mm239-DTT increased further up to r = 0.19, and the rotational correlation time was increased to Φ
= 2.42 ns. The increase of both parameters is a very strong indication
of DC7-Ab conjugation to the liposome surface. Only the semicone angle
of θk = 52° (calculated
based on the wobble-in-a-cone model) did not change significantly.
The almost unchanged cone angle indicates that the location of the
dye in the lipid phase of the liposome is not altered by the attachment
of the antibody, which could be an effect of the increased distance
due to the cross-linker.

To show that the labeling as such and
the presence of the
liposome did not interfere with the function of the antibody, the
binding of the respective antigen was investigated. The DC7-Ab is
directed against R6G. Because of the spectral overlap between the
emission spectrum of mm239-DTT and the absorption spectrum of R6G
(see Figure 3), a potential
FRET pair is on hand. The calculated Förster radius of R0 = 5.5 nm is large enough to monitor the binding
of R6G to DC-7-Ab bound to mm239-DTT in liposomes but on the other
hand small enough to show a cross sensitivity between different liposomes
of different mm239 dyes in one liposome at low to medium loading.
Consequently, upon binding between the partners, FRET is expected
to yield a decrease in the donor emission (quantum yield as well as
fluorescence decay time) and a simultaneous increase of the acceptor
emission, if the distance R between mm239 and R6G
in the complex is in the range of 0.5R0 < R < 2R0 (with R0 being the Förster radius), which should
be the case for the liposomal system investigated.

Figure 3 Normalized excitation
and emission spectra of mm239-DTT immobilized
in liposomes (blue) as well as excitation and emission spectra of
R6G in PBS (red). The marked area represents the spectral overlap
between donor emission (mm239-DTT) and acceptor absorption (R6G).
Based on the spectroscopic parameters a Förster distance R0 = 5.5 nm was calculated.

Therefore, in order to monitor the binding between the mm239-DTT-DC7
and R6G, the fluorescence (intensity as well as decay kinetics) of
both fluorophores was measured. The binding experiments were performed
by preparing samples, which had the same concentration of mm239-DTT-DC7-labeled
liposomes but different amounts of R6G. According to the intensity
spectra shown in Figure 4 (left), the intensity of the donor part (mm239 moiety) decreased
when the concentration of acceptor R6G was increased, and at the same
time the acceptor-related fluorescence increased. Both observations
point to a FRET which proved the successful binding of DC7-Ab to the
liposome surface.

liposome with increasing concentration of R6G (λex = 370 nm). (Right, top) Fluorescence decay kinetics of the donor
emission with
increase of R6G concentration (the “peak” at short times
is related to scattered excitation light, which was of high intensity
in the liposome samples). (Right, bottom) Fluorescence decay kinetics
of acceptor emission.

Complementary to the steady-state emission spectra the fluorescence
decay kinetics of the donor (mm239) and acceptor (R6G) of DC7-Ab-conjugated
mm239-labeled liposomes were measured and analyzed. In Figure 4 (right) the decay kinetics
of the donor and acceptor emissions are shown at different donor–acceptor
ratios. The acceptor fluorescence was measured under donor-specific
excitation conditions in order to obtain the energy transfer related
decays. The donor fluorescence decay time decreased from about 16
ns (for DC7-Ab-conjugated mm239-labeled liposomes) to ∼5 ns
for the highest R6G concentration investigated (see Figure 4). At the same time the fluorescence
decay kinetics of R6G became biexponential, showing a steady increase
of the fluorescence decay. Because R6G
was also excited directly to a small extent at the donor excitation
wavelength of λex = 375 nm, a combination of direct
excited and via FRET excited emission kinetics was detected. As a
trend from the analysis of the decay kinetics an increasing fraction
of FRET-related R6G emission was found. For that fraction the determined
decay time was 13 ± 1 ns, which was in agreement with the nonquenched
donor fluorescence decay time and further stressed the active FRET
in the liposome-based immune complex.

Single-molecule FRET experiments
(PIE-FRET) were also carried out
in order to avoid the averaging out effect, contribution from free
donor emission, and the influence of directly excited acceptor emission,
which often obscure ensemble FRET measurements yielding the wrong
FRET parameters (see Figure 5). The distance between the donor and acceptor was determined
to be R ∼ 5.1 nm (0.94R0).

Figure 5 FRET efficiency histogram (left) and the distance between donor
and acceptor were determined in the value of the Förster radius R0 (right).

In Table 2 the results
of the ensemble-based (intensity as well as decay time related) and
PIE-FRET results of the calculated FRET efficiencies are compared.
For the calculation of the ensemble-related FRET efficiencies the
direct excitation of the acceptor and its contribution to the signal
had to be taken into account. On the other hand the PIE-FRET experiments
were performed at a very low liposome concentration. Measurements
were carried out at several different dilutions of the liposomes but
yielded always the same distance distribution, which was expected
since the distance between donor and acceptor in the complex is always
the same. Due to the high affinity of the Ab for its antigen, the
R6G binding was high, and therefore basically all the donor sites
became involved in the FRET. Consequently, no signal of “free”
donor was found.

Conclusion
The
labeling of biomolecules with optical probes, that are often
highly hydrophobic molecules, requires a compromise in the solvent
polarity. However, many biomolecules are very sensitive to organic
solvents and may be irreversibly altered (or even destroyed) in their
function in organic solvents (mixtures). DBD dyes but also other classes
of dyes can be used in the proposed labeling scheme without the necessity
of adding additional (often) charged groups to the dyes in order to
improve their water solubility. Using liposome as a mediator phase
such labeling can be nicely accomplished. Here, the liposomes (or
their surface) can be seen as “small” reaction vessels
offering the hydrophobic environment for the probes and their hydrophilic
surface for the attachment of the biomolecules. The full reaction
scheme (see Figure 7) could be demonstrated step by step based on the change in the fluorescence
parameters of mm239 in liposomes. First, the modification with DTT
was indicated by a significant increase in the fluorescence intensity
as well as the fluorescence decay time. The successful incorporation
and the subsequent labeling to an Ab were demonstrated by the distinct
changes of the fluorescence depolarization of the DBD dye mm239. The
connection of the Ab to the surface of the liposome was also stressed
by the anisotropy data. Finally, the binding activity of the Ab (when
connected to the liposome) was demonstrated in FRET experiments. Here,
R6G was used as antigen. Depending on the specific needs it can be
envisaged that after the successful conjugation the liposomes may
be destroyed, releasing the labeled biomolecules, or can be developed
into a signal amplification scheme as has been shown before for different
liposome-based assays.

Labeling of biomolecules often leads
to the conjugation of more
than one dye molecule per antibody (unless there is only one specific
functional group such as R–SH per biomolecule), which then
can lead to unwanted effects like self-quenching or loss of binding
activity.32 With the proposed labeling
scheme using liposomes as a mediator phase, the possibilities of multiple
labelings of the biomolecule are distinctly reduced due to steric
considerations, and at the same time an efficient, relatively simple
strategy for signal amplification (on a single liposome level) is
on hand. The assay response can be easily scaled with respect to binding
sites per liposome via the loading of the vesicle with DBD dye derivative.
This can be controlled, even on a single liposome level using laser
fluorescence microscopy techniques. Since liposomes are “nanocontainers”
the consumption of analytes/chemical can be minimized. In addition,
even a multianalyte detection on one liposome can be envisaged, if
different Abs are attached to the liposome surface using tailored
DBD dyes, which allow an excellent tuning of the absorption/emission
parameters.

Work is in progress to evaluate the sensitivity
of the liposome-based
assay relative to enzyme-based conventional ELISA assays. Although
the experiments shown here were carried out in PBS buffer, additional
experiments and fine adjustments are needed to transfer this test
scheme to real-world samples.

Materials and Methods
DBD derivative
(mm239) was synthesized by the group of Prof. P.
Wessig (Institute of Chemistry, University of Potsdam).12 The chemical structure of the compound is depicted
in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Chemical structure
of DBD derivative mm239.

Succinimidyl-6-(b-maleimidopropionamido)hexanoate
(SMPH), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dithiothreitol (DTT), chloroform
(CHCl3), and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Munich, Germany. The GC71-DC7 anti-TAMRA-antibody
(DC7-Ab) was synthesized by Hybrotec GmbH, Am Mühlenberg 11,
Potsdam, Germany. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(POPC) and rhodamine 6G were purchased
from Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabama, and Sirah Lasertechnik GmbH, Grevenbroich,
Germany, respectively

The fluorescence spectra were measured
in DMSO and PBS. The experiments
with samples containing antibodies were carried out in PBS. All chemicals
and solvents were of analytical grade.

Liposome Preparation
The incorporation of mm239 into
the phospholipid vesicles (liposomes) was carried out based on a rehydration
technique (see Figure 7). The mixture of phospholipid and mm239
was first dissolved in CHCl3; subsequently, CHCl3 was evaporated by applying a gentle stream of nitrogen gas, followed
by using vacuum overnight to fully remove the remaining organic solvent
residues. The PBS
solution was added to dry lipid film and incubated at 50 °C for
1
h. Freeze-and-thaw cycles (×5) were performed by immersion in
liquid nitrogen followed by thawing in a water bath (50 °C).
Finally extrusion through the 100 nm pore size polycarbonate membrane
(Whatman, United Kingdom) was carried out, and homogeneous mm239-labeled
large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were obtained. The size of the liposomes
was determined using dynamic light scattering (Zetasizer NanoZS, Malvern
Panalytical) to 70 ± 5 nm (with a PDI of 0.13).

Figure 7 Scheme of the incorporation of mm239 into the liposome and coupling
the DC7-Ab to the vesicle. Also shown is the expected FRET system
after binding between DC7-Ab and R6G.

In order
to couple DC7-Ab to liposomes,
DTT was added to the mm239-labeled liposome sample solution with the
molar ratio of 10:1. The mixture was then incubated for 1 h at RT,
followed by removing the excess amount of DTT by using Amicon
Ultra 0.5 mL centrifugal filters with a molecular weight cut off (MWCO)
of 3 KDa (Merck, Germany) (centrifugation for 20 min twice).

DC7-Ab was treated with the hetero cross-linker SMPH (reaction molar
ratio between DC7-Ab and SMPH = 1:20). The
reaction mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C, the NHS ester
group of the SMPH cross-linkers reacted with primary amines in DC7-Ab
to yield stable amide bonds.
The mixture was then put in Amicon Ultra 0.5 mL centrifugal filters
with MWCO of 10 kDa and centrifuged to remove excess amount of SMPH
(twice for 20 min at 4 °C).

The DTT-mm239-labeled liposome
solution was mixed with SMPH-labeled
DC7-Ab (molar ratio 1:1) and incubated at RT for 1 h. The maleimide
functional group in SMPH-labeled DC7-Ab reacted with
the free thiol group on the DTT-mm239-labeled vesicle to form a thioether
bond.

Steady-State Fluorescence Spectroscopy
The steady-state
fluorescence measurements were performed using a Fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer
(Horiba Jobin Yvon, Japan) operated in the single photon counting
mode. Excitation wavelengths of λex = 370 nm were
applied in the fluorescence experiments to record the emission spectra
of the mm239 dye.

The fluorescence anisotropy excitation spectra
were measured by exciting the mm239 with vertical polarized light,
and the emission was detected with the polarizer set to vertical (Ivv) and horizontal (Ivh) orientation, respectively. The polarized emission was recorded
at λem = 470 nm. The anisotropy r was calculated according to equation eq 1 1  

Here, G is the correction factor to take into
account the different efficiencies of the optical components for vertical
and horizontal polarized light. The G factor value
was calculated according to eq 2. 2  

Time-Resolved Fluorescence
Depolarization
To measure
the fluorescence decay kinetics, a FL920 spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments,
UK) equipped with a multichannel plate (Europhoton, Germany) operated
in the time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) mode was used.
A laser diode (EPL-375, Edinburgh Instruments, λex = 375 nm) with a pulse width of 55 ps and a repetition rate of 10
MHz was used as the excitation source. A supercontinuum source SC450-AOTF
(Fianium, UK, λex = 520 nm, pulse width of 50 ps,
20 MHz repetition rate) was applied for the investigation of the R6G
fluorescence decay kinetics. The fluorescence decays were recorded
with an emission polarizer (Glan Thompson prism, Thorlabs, Germany)
set to magic angle conditions at λem = 470 nm for
mm239 and at λem = 580 nm in the case of R6G. The
time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy r(t) was calculated based on eq 3. In the depolarization measurements photons
were collected for 900 s. 3  The G factor was determined
according to eq 4. 4  

Single-Molecule
Spectroscopy (SMS)
The pulsed interleaved
excitation FRET (PIE-FRET) SMS experiments were performed using a
MicroTime 200 instrument (PicoQuant, Germany). R6G was excited at
λex = 532 nm using a supercontinuum laser source
(SC-400-2,
Fianium, England) in combination with an AOTF filter. The laser
beam was focused to a 50 μL droplet of sample on the cover slide
or to a 200 μL sample in chambered cover glass (Nunc, Lab-Tek,
Thermo Scientific,
Germany) by an oil immersion objective (100×, NA 1.4, Zeiss PlanApo,
Germany). The emission light was collected by the same objective and
separated from excitation light by a dual band dichroic mirror (ZT
405/532rpc-UF1, AHF Analysentechnik AG, Tübingen, Germany).
After passing a 50 μm pinhole, the emission light was detected
by two avalanche photodiodes operated in the single photon counting
mode. As the second laser source a picosecond pulsed diode laser (λex = 405 nm) was used to excite mm239. For the pulsed interleaved
excitation the 532 nm laser pulse was electronically delayed by 23.5
ns with respect to the 405 nm laser pulse. The donor (mm239) and acceptor
(R6G) emissions were separated using a beam splitter (FF552-Di02–25
× 36, Semrock, USA). Suitable bandpass filters (SP492
nm and LP560 nm in the donor and in the acceptor detection path, respectively)
were inserted to further eliminate the excitation wavelength and reduce
spectral crosstalk. All experiments were performed at room temperature
(RT, T = 25 ± 1 °C). The data acquisition
and the calculations of the autocorrelation
curves were performed using the SymPhotime software (PicoQuant, Germany).
All other data sets were further analyzed using Origin (OriginLab,
Corp., USA). The calibration was carried out by measuring Rhodamine
6G in PBS with a diffusion coefficient of (4.14 ± 0.1) ×
10–6 cm2/s at 25 °C to determine
the focal volume (described by an optical plane wo and an optical axis zo).
