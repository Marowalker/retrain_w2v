Thiol-ene/acrylate shape-memory polymers
can be used as base substrates
for neural electrodes to treat neurological dysfunction. Neural electrodes
are implanted into the body to alter or record impulse conduction.
This study characterizes thiol-ene/acrylate polymers to determine
which synthesis methods constitute an ideal substrate for neural implants.
To achieve a desired Tg between 50 and
56.5 °C, curing conditions, polymer thickness, monomer ratios,
and water uptake were all examined and controlled for. Characterization
with dynamic mechanical analysis and thermal gravimetric analysis
reveals that thin, thiol-ene/acrylate polymers composed of at least
50 mol % acrylate content and cured for at least 1 h at 365 nm are
promising as substrates for neural electrodes.

Introduction
Biotechnological advancements have created
an emerging field for
flexible implants that help reduce the burden of damaged body systems,
such as neurological dysfunction. Although previous technologies provide
promising solutions, they have their share of drawbacks, such as lack
of long-term robustness and too much stiffness.1,2 For
example, silicone-based neural electrodes are soft in vivo but may
lack the stiffness to pierce soft tissue and have led to glial scar
formation that reduces long-term stability.3 One reason is due to a chronic response from the body owing to the
mechanical mismatch between the foreign, stiff electrode implants,
and the significantly softer body tissue.4−8 Fortunately, flexible shape-memory polymers (SMPs)
can address this problem and reduce the abiotic–biotic mismatch
by being stiff during insertion, yet soft in vivo.2,9−12

A shape-memory polymer (SMP) is a polymer that can change
its shape
when exposed to an external stimulus, such as temperature, solvent,
pH, or electricity.13−22 The temperature at which the polymer changes its shape is defined
as the transition temperature (Ttrans).
A shape change due to a change in environmental temperature is called
a thermally induced shape-memory effect (SME). Meanwhile, a shape
change due to the introduction of a solvent, typically water, is called
a softening-induced shape-memory effect, which occurs due to the polymer’s
molecular structure.14,23,24 When the polymer interacts with the solvent, a physical swelling
effect or chemical plasticizing effect occurs between the solvent
molecules and the polymer network. The solvent molecules become absorbed
in the polymer and plasticize the polymer by reducing the interaction
forces in the polymer network.25 This force
depression makes the polymer chains more flexible and lowers the Ttrans.26 The thiol-ene/acrylate
SMP system relies on both thermally induced and softening-induced
shape-memory effects.

Although there has been extensive research
on the SMP systems such
as polyacrylate and polyurethane system, less is known about the thiol-ene/acrylate
system. The thiol-ene/acrylate SMP system is a tunable system that
allows for the creation of specific polymer formulas that are composed
of different concentrations of monomers from thiol, alkene, and acrylate
families.27,28 These monomers form a “click”
reaction, meaning that the so-called mixed-mode reaction produces
high-yield products with high reaction specificity and minimal byproducts
while occurring in simple reaction conditions.29 In comparison to the acrylate system, the thiol-ene/acrylate
system forms stable uniform networks, a low cure stress product, and
is not inhibited by oxygen.10,28 Moreover, the thiol-ene/acrylate
system benefits from strong interactions between the thiol groups
and noble metals. This improved adhesion from the thiol-ene/acrylate
polymer has proven to be successful in intracortical probes that used
noble metals, such as gold, to record the neural activity while displaying
long-term robustness.1,30 It has recently been demonstrated
that thiol-ene/acrylate polymers are biocompatible12 and capable of sterilization with ethylene oxide,31 which makes them ideal candidates for biomedical
applications.

SMPs have been extensively studied for their potential
in biomedical
devices, such as acting as vascular stents, self-tightening sutures,
and neuroprosthetics.2,32−43 By synthesizing and characterizing a thiol-ene/acrylate SMP system,
this study strives to determine how differences in the polymer structure
and synthesis process affect its potential as a neural electrode substrate.
We implement various fabrication methods and composition ratios to
understand how to tune the glass transition temperature (Tg) so that the softening-induced SME results in the polymer
being stiff near normal body temperature but soft after plasticization
in bodily fluids. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) test results show Tg shift based on different curing scenarios
and varying monomer ratios. Meanwhile, the thermal gravimetric analysis
(TGA) and swelling tests provide further valuable information regarding
the degradation and expansion of the polymer, respectively. A careful
examination of this combination of monomers will help advance further
research on the thiol-ene/acrylate system’s potential as neuroprosthetic
implants.

Results
Table 1 provides
an overview of the variations in the polymer synthesis for each part
of the study. In each part, one variable was altered, whereas all
of the other variables were held constant, so the results would be
solely due to the variable in question.

a Part I
of the study tested how differences
in the curing wavelength, as well as exposure to UV light during the
polymerization process, affected the Tg. Part II tested the differences in the polymer characteristics when
casted compared with when spin-coated. Part III examined how monomer
mole variations affect Tg, the degradation
process, and water uptake. Samples 3A and 3B were not tested against
each other, but against themselves.

Part I: Impact of Curing Conditions
Part I of the study
consisted of determining the most optimal curing wavelength of the
polymers. All of the samples comprised of 31% tricyclodecanedimethanoldiacrylate
(TCMDA), which was often used in previous studies, and were spin-coated
to mimic the thinness of polymers that will be used in neural probes.44 Two categories of polymers were synthesized:
254 nm cured and 365 nm cured. The chosen wavelengths have been frequently
studied in previous works.10,30,31,44 Each category contained three
samples, which varied by the amount of time they were cured in their
respective UV-curing chamber. Both categories’ samples were
cured for 30 min, 1 h, or 2 h. The DMA was performed to determine
how the curing method and time differences affect the Tg. The TGA was performed to understand differences in
the polymer structure and decomposition.

The DMA measurements
for the 365 versus 254 nm samples, as shown in Figure 1a, depict Tg,
as denoted by the peaks of the tan δ curves, shifting
for 254 nm cured polymers. As the curing time increased, the Tg increased for the 254 nm cured polymers from
58.8 to 69.3 °C. The spread of the tan δ curves
also increased with curing time for polymers cured at 254 nm. In addition,
the storage modulus in the rubbery regime for the 254 nm cured polymers
increased with time and was greater than that in regime for the 365
nm cured polymers. Meanwhile, the samples cured at 365 nm showed no
significant change in Tg as the time of
curing increased. Furthermore, the TGA measurements, shown in Figure 1b, reveal that aside
from the 30 min 365 nm cured sample, there were no significant differences
among the curing times or curing wavelengths. The 30 min 365 nm cured
sample started to degrade at a lower temperature than its counterparts.

polymers cured under 365 or 254 nm UV bulbs
and for various amounts of time, characterized by (a) dynamical mechanical
analysis for Tg and (b) thermal gravimetric
analysis for degradation characteristics.

Part II: Casting versus Spin-Coating
Part II of the
study tested the differences between the casting method and spin-coating
method. Thicker, casted samples are commonly used in polymer characterization
studies.30,44,45 However, future
applications of SMPs will use much thinner polymers as substrates
for neural electrodes. The determined optimal curing method from part
I of the study was held constant for the part II samples, as were
the mole percentages of the monomers and the time cured in the UV-curing
chamber. The DMA was performed on both the casted and spin-coated
samples to determine how the methods affected the Tg. Meanwhile, the TGA was performed to reveal how the
polymer structure may differ between the two methods.

The DMA
measurements, as shown in Figure 2a, display the casted and spin-coated polymer with
similar transition and modulus curve shapes but differing in Tg. The spin-coated sample displays a higher Tg of 39.4 °C than the casted sample, which
had a Tg of 32.2 °C. As for the TGA
measurements, shown in Figure 2b, the spin-coated sample starts degrading at a lower temperature
than the casted sample.

in Tg between the spin-coated and casted
polymers. (b) TGA
measurements displaying differences in the degradation process between
the spin-coated and casted polymers.

Part III: Altered TCMDA Content
In part III of the
study, we wanted to understand how the mole percentages of TCMDA,
the acrylate component, affected the characteristics of the polymer.
In the samples 3A, the mole percentages of TCMDA varied at 10, 20,
31, 40, and 50%, whereas the spin-coating process, curing wavelength,
and curing time were all held constant. The DMA was performed to determine
how the acrylate percentage alters the Tg. The TGA was performed to understand differences in the
degradation temperature between the varied TCMDA mole percentages
and the structural character of the polymer.

The DMA performance
in part III, as shown in Figure 3a, on the thiol-ene/acrylate polymers with varied ratios
of TCMDA revealed an increase in Tg and
a spread in the transition curve with increase in the mole percentage
of TCMDA. The Tg varied from 28.0 °C
for the 10% TCMDA polymer to 45.9 °C for the 50% TCMDA polymer.
In addition, the TGA data on the polymers with varied TCMDA content,
as shown in Figure 3b, reveal unique characteristics when taking the derivative of the
degradation percentage curve. The 10 and 20% TCMDA degradation rate
curves showed similar symmetrical curves that degraded uniformly,
whereas the 40 and 50% TCMDA both had a front-shoulder that degraded
before the rest of the polymer. The 31% TCMDA results displayed a
mixture of the low-TCMDA percentage and high-TCMDA percentage curve
characteristic.

polymers.

Despite differences between the
casted and spin-coated polymers,
the samples for swelling tests were made with the casting method to
create larger, thicker samples to the decrease marginal errors in
the accuracy-focused water uptake measurements. Swelling tests were
performed to mimic physiological conditions and to understand how
well the polymers withstand water uptake. Three polymers were created
with the compositions of 10, 31, and 50%. Samples were casted between
two glass slides with a 0.5 mm thick spacer and cured in a 365 nm
UV oven for 1 h. The samples were soaked in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and measured at desired time periods to determine if the mole
percentages of TCMDA significantly affect the water uptake.

Swelling tests results (Figure 4) from the three chosen TCMDA percentages revealed
favorable results regarding fluid uptake. The water uptake percentages
of the polymers were calculated as an average of five samples of each
polymer. As the percentage of TCMDA decreased, the amount of swelling
increased. Each of the three polymers reached a water uptake limit
and leveled off within the first day. All of the polymers remained
below 1.11% water uptake by volume.

and 50% TCMDA samples over
a period of 28 days.

Discussion
Determination of a suitable candidate for
the polymers to act as
substrates for neural electrodes requires understanding which synthesis
methods are optimal and tuning Tg to the
desired temperature range. The normal body temperature ranges from
36.5 to 37.5 °C but, depending on the patient, may range from
34 °C for hypothermic patients to 38 °C for those with fever.
However, during the surgical process, both anesthesia and implant
location have an effect on the desired range and must be taken into
account. Body temperature in the limbs is generally lower than that
in the core, which houses the central nervous system and is the intended
implant location of the neural probes. Nonetheless, anesthesia can
reduce core body temperature by 0.5–1.5 °C, thus suggesting
an ideal temperature range between 35 and 36.5 °C.46 In a study by Ecker et al., Tg of the polymer decreased by 15–20 °C after
being soaked in PBS, when compared with dry polymers.31 Because of the softening-induced shape-memory effect when
soaking the polymer, ideal Tg values should
range between 50 and 56.5 °C.

Every step of the synthesis
process has the potential to alter
the polymer’s Tg. Previous studies
have cured the polymer under either 254 or 365 nm UV light for curing
times ranging from 15 min to 2 h.10,31 Part I of
the study was conducted to determine whether one UV wavelength was
more optimal for curing, or if they had no effect. In part I, DMA
data in Figure 1a reveal
sharper tan δ curves for the 365 nm samples, when compared
with the 254 nm samples, indicating a more homogeneous polymer that
changes shape at approximately the same temperature.31 On the other hand, the 254 nm cured curves possess more
spread, suggesting a less homogeneous polymer that slowly changes
shape over a range of temperatures. Explanations for the nonhomogeneous-like
characteristics may include the strength of the UV length. The 254
nm light exhibits a high energy that may have damaged the intramolecular
and intermolecular bonds among the monomers, creating radicals that
can react in unintended ways, such as with oxygen. As a result, the
surface of the polymer has a different monomer structure than the
deeper, less-exposed areas of the polymer. The minor bond-linkage
differences between different regions of the polymer lead to a nonhomogeneous
sample. As the length of time of exposure to the high-energy 254 nm
UV light increases, more damages occur on the bonds, thus creating
more nonhomogeneity and a tan δ curve with a greater
spread.

Additionally, in Figure 1a, the higher storage modulus in the 254 nm cured polymers
indicates more cross-linking among the monomers than that in the 365
nm cured polymers, which may create more mesh-like structures leading
to less bond rotation. In addition, oxidized sulfur–oxygen
double bonds may result between trimethylolpropanetris(3-mercaptopropionate)
(TMTMP) and other monomers, creating less rotational freedom between
the bonds. As a result of the two explanations, the more exposure
to the UV light the polymer has, the less internal freedom there is
in the polymer to change shape, and more energy is needed to rotate
the bonds. Therefore, the Tg increases
as the curing time increases.

In the TGA measurements in part
I of the study, shown in Figure 1b, the 30 min 365
nm cured sample degraded at a lower temperature than the other samples
because the lower-energy 365 nm UV light did not have enough time
to fully polymerize the monomers. This created weaker bonds compared
with those in the samples that had either more time to polymerize
or were polymerized with more energy. Polymers cured at 365 nm for
at least 1 h are more suitable candidates for neuroprosthetic implants
compared with 254 nm cured samples because their Tg was independent of the curing time and the samples displayed
greater structural homogeneity. For the 365 nm samples, there were
no significant differences in the polymer characteristics when cured
for 1 h than when cured for 2 h. In addition, the onset of thermal
degradation in TGA measurements is vital for cleanroom processing,
during which procedures may require temperatures of 300 °C or
higher. A polymer with a later onset of degradation, in this case
samples cured at 1 h or more, would be more suitable for future neuroprosthetic
devices.

After understanding how the curing wavelength and time
affected
the polymer, casted and spin-coated samples were tested to determine
any difference. Thin, spin-coated polymers will be used in neural
probe devices, but they are often difficult to test with DMA and TGA.
Previous studies have admitted to using thick, casted samples rather
than thin, spin-coated samples due to mechanical testing limitations.10 Part II of the study was conducted to determine
if there were significant differences between casted and spin-coated
samples for future experiments. DMA results, shown in Figure 2a, revealed the spin-coated
sample having a higher Tg than the casted
sample due to differences in UV light energy absorption, which is
consistent with the findings of Ecker et al., who studied the mechanical
characteristics of thiol-ene/acrylate SMPs upon sterilization.31 Because the casted sample, 0.5 mm, is thicker
than the spin-coated sample, 30 μm, the energy from the UV light
may damage the surface layers more than the internal layers, thus
altering its mechanical characteristics.31 Furthermore, the thickness of the casted sample may result in the
UV energy being more distributed between the monomers compared with
that in the spin-coated sample, which has fewer overall monomers.
As a result, there may not be as many or as strong bonds in the casted
samples than in the thinner samples. The fewer or weaker bonds allow
for more flexibility and require less energy to rotate. So, the casted
sample changes shape at a lower temperature than does the spin-coated
samples and the difference between the two synthesis methods is significant.

When performing the TGA in part II of the study, the casted samples
were cut with a hole-puncher and placed as a disk on the tray. On
the other hand, the thin spin-coated samples were cut and folded into
a zig-zag shape into a tray because a single disk-shaped sample’s
mass is too minimal to provide reliable data. So, the greater surface
area in the spin-coated samples allows for the greater exposure of
intermolecular bonds to break due to temperature. As a result of the
surface area differences, the spin-coated samples degraded before
the casted samples and had a higher rate of degradation until 390
°C. Despite the casted samples being less complicated to perform
with, the spin-coated and casted samples have different characteristics,
and future studies should be directed more toward samples with the
same thinness as those used in prospective biomedical devices.

Thin films were subsequently used to determine how monomer composition
affects the polymer. Previous works have studied the thermomechanical
properties of the polymer at 31% TCMDA.44 Ware et al. determined that varying the mole percentage of TCMDA
in a different thiol-ene/acrylate polymer between 0 and 31% alters Tg.10 Therefore, mole
variations of TCMDA can be used to precisely tune Tg to the desired physiological temperature under anesthesia
to activate the polymer upon implantation.14Tg of the polymers ranging from 10 to
50% TCMDA were measured to determine how to tune the thiol-ene/acrylate
polymer to have a dry Tg above 36.5 °C
for stiffness during insertion but a soaked Tg below 35 °C for flexibility with tissues. A future step
would comprise of conducting DMA measurements in PBS to mimic in vivo
conditions to verify the transition temperature in the soaked state.

In part III, the increasing Tg with
increasing TCMDA content of the study, shown in Figure 3a, is attributed to the quantity and structure
of acrylates in the samples. TCMDA consist of a bridged tricyclic
component that may offer less structural freedom than TMTMP, the thiol
monomer, and 1,3,5-triallyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6(1H,3H,5H)-trione (TATATO), the acrylate
monomer. As a result of the greater stiffness, it takes more energy
or a higher temperature, for the bonds to rotate and let the polymer
change shape. In addition, the increase in the curve spread with increase
in the TCMDA content is presumably due to the chemical nature of the
acrylate. The acrylates have the ability to react with other acrylates,
thus causing small regions containing more acrylates than others.
The result is less homogeneity with the increasing TCMDA content,
which may explain the wider curves. Furthermore, the thiol-ene/acrylate
polymer with 50% TCMDA shows promise due to its Tg of 45.9 °C, as shown in Figure 3. This suggests it will be stiff during insertion
around 35–36.5 °C while being soft in vivo with a soaked Tg presumably around 25–30 °C. Fine-tuning
the Tg of the polymer to be between 50
and 56.5 °C can be achieved by studying the thiol-ene/acrylate
polymer with increasing variations of TCMDA above 50%. Likewise, future
DMA tests with the polymer soaked in PBS will need to be performed
to confirm the degree of softening.

As for the TGA measurements
in part III of the study, shown in Figure 3b, the differences
between the degradation rate curves are attributed to the quantity
of the monomers themselves as well as the bonds between the monomers
because each sample has different absolute amounts of each monomer.
Furthermore, variations may be attributed to carbon dioxide being
randomly released from TMTMP and TCMDA monomers during the degradation
process. Additionally, the fact that none of the samples had more
than 1.11% water uptake by volume in the swelling tests, shown in Figure 4, is greatly beneficial
for the neural electrodes that will be fabricated onto the polymers.
Too much swelling in vivo leads to polymer expansion that could potentially
destroy the neural devices due to breakage or delamination of the
electronics.

Conclusions
Future application for
the thiol-ene/acrylate SMP system is directed
toward a base substrate for neural electrodes. In other words, neural
electronics are fabricated onto the polymer and then inserted into
the body. Within the body, these neural electrodes can record, stimulate,
or block neural conduction. In this study, we have identified characteristics
pertaining to the thiol-ene/acrylate SMP system that could lead to
the development of the ideal implant with a Tg between 50 and 56.5 °C. Curing wavelength and time,
polymer thickness, monomer composition ratios, and water uptake were
all examined with all of the other factors controlled for. An analysis
of DMA and TGA results indicate that thin thiol-ene/acrylate polymers
cured at 365 nm for at least 1 h with at least 50% TCMDA show promise
as polymer substrates for neural devices. This study, in combination
of future work, will help pave the path for manipulating nerve conduction
that has the potential to treat neurological dysfunction.

Methods
Materials
1,3,5-Triallyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6(1H,3H,5H)-trione (TATATO),
trimethylolpropanetris(3-mercaptopropionate) (TMTMP), tricyclodecanedimethanoldiacrylate
(TCMDA), and 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenyl-acetophenone (DMPA) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification.

Polymer Synthesis
Varying the concentration of TCMDA,
while keeping the stoichiometric ratios of TATATO and TMTMP equal,
has been shown to alter Tg.44 The monomer solution consisted of equal stoichiometric
ratios of TATATO and TMTMP, 0.1 wt % DMPA, and TCMDA concentrations
at mole percentages of 10, 20, 31, 40, and 50%. The monomers used
are depicted in Figure 5a, whereas Table 1 shows which mole percentages were used for the different tests.

Figure 5 a) Monomers
used to make the thiol-ene/acrylate polymer. (b) Graphic
of the casting process. Monomer solution was pipetted in between two
glass slides separated by spacers of the desired thickness at two
ends. (c) Two-part diagram of the spin-coating process. Monomer solution
was added to the top of a spin-coater, which rotated to evenly spread
the monomer solution over the surface at the desired thickness.

First, TATATO, TCMDA, and DMPA
were mixed in proportionate amounts
to create the appropriate mole ratios of the monomers in each sample.
Immediately after the addition of the photoinitiator (DMPA), the vial
was wrapped with aluminum foil to prevent polymerization from external
light. A vortexing step followed to homogenize the monomer solution
at 2000 rpm for 5 min in a speedmixer. TMTMP was subsequently added
in the foil-wrapped vial and the solution was vortexed at 2000 rpm
for 5 min for a second homogenizing step.

The sample was then
either casted between two glass slides to create
thick samples or spin-coated, as illustrated in Figure 5b. During the casting process, two glass
slides were first cleaned with acetone and sprayed with a hydrophobic
spray to allow for later removal of the polymer from the slide. Two
plastic spacers 0.5 mm thick were placed on the edges between the
two glass slides and clamped with a standard binder clip. The monomer
solution was subsequently pipetted between the glass slides, creating
a 0.5 mm thick product.10 For samples undergoing
the spin-coating process instead, the monomer solution was poured
onto a glass slide. A Laurell WS-650-23B spin-coater spun at 600 rpm
with an acceleration of 2000 m s–2 for 25 s to create
uniform 30 μm samples.31

After
either casting or spin-coating the sample, the sample on
the glass slide was polymerized by photoinitiating the sample in an
UV cross-linker oven with either 365 or 254 nm UV bulbs for desired
periods of time as depicted in Table 1. For the casted samples, the top glass slide was removed
after 5 min in the oven to prevent it from blocking the UV light from
reaching the polymer.31 Finally, the sample
was placed in a postcuring chamber at 120 °C and 0.17 bar for
24 h. The spin-coated polymer was removed from the glass slide by
soaking the sample in deionized water for 5 min and separating the
polymer with a razor.44

Dynamic Mechanical
Analysis (DMA)
A Mettler Toledo
DMA/SDTA861e was used to perform dynamic mechanical analysis on the
polymers. The 30 μm thick polymer samples were laser-cut with
CO2 using a Gravograph LS100 to create rectangles 10.5
mm in length and 2.8 mm in width. Samples were heated from −10
to 150 °C at a heating rate of 2 °C min–1 in a nitrogen environment. The polymers were measured with tension
at a frequency of 1 Hz, force amplitude of 2 N, and a displacement
amplitude of 20 μm.10,30

Thermal Gravimetric Analysis
(TGA)
A Mettler Toledo
TGA/DSC 1 was used to perform thermal gravimetric analysis on the
30 μm spin-coated samples. The polymer samples were heated from
25 to 700 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C min–1 and a flow of nitrogen gas of 50 mL min–1.30 Samples were approximately 4 mg each.

Swelling
Tests
The 0.5 mm casted samples were cut and
soaked in a PBS solution and stored at 37 °C for a 4 week period
in enclosed glass vials to simulate physiological conditions. The
samples were weighed on a balance with 0.01 mg precision before the
soaking period. During certain days throughout the soaking process,
the samples were removed from the PBS vials and dried using a lint-free
cloth. The swollen sample was weighed on the balance with 0.01 mg
precision. Polymers consisting of 10, 31, and 50% TCMDA polymerized
under UV light for 1 h were tested. Samples were weighed after 1,
3, 4, 5, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of soaking. The amount of swelling
was calculated as a mass change percent from samples when dry using
the following formula  where ms is the
weight of the swollen samples and mi is
the weight of the samples when dry.30 The
mass change percentage of five samples from the three different polymers
were calculated and averaged to determine the final swelling percentage
of the respective polymer.
