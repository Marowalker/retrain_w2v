Clinical studies have identified
a correlation between type-2 diabetes
mellitus and cognitive decrements en route to the onset of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD). Recent studies have established that post-translational
modifications of the amyloid β (Aβ) peptide occur under
hyperglycemic conditions; particularly, the process of glycation exacerbates
its neurotoxicity and accelerates AD progression. In view of the assertion
that macromolecular crowding has an altering effect on protein self-assembly,
it is crucial to characterize the effects of hyperglycemic conditions
via crowding on Aβ self-assembly. Toward this purpose, fully
atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were performed to study the
effects of glucose crowding on Aβ dimerization, which is the
smallest known neurotoxic species. The dimers formed in the glucose-crowded
environment were found to have weaker associations as compared to
that of those formed in water. Binding free energy calculations show
that the reduced binding strength of the dimers can be mainly attributed
to the overall weakening of the dispersion interactions correlated
with substantial loss of interpeptide contacts in the hydrophobic
patches of the Aβ units. Analysis to discern the differential
solvation pattern in the glucose-crowded and pure water systems revealed
that glucose molecules cluster around the protein, at a distance of
5–7 Å, which traps the water molecules in close association
with the protein surface. This preferential exclusion of glucose molecules
and resulting hydration of the Aβ peptides has a screening effect
on the hydrophobic interactions, which in turn diminishes the binding
strength of the resulting dimers. Our results imply that physical
effects attributed to crowded hyperglycemic environments are incapable
of solely promoting Aβ self-assembly, indicating that further
mechanistic studies are required to provide insights into the self-assembly
of post-translationally modified Aβ peptides, known to possess
aggravated toxicity, under these conditions.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) is the most common form of senile
dementia and currently affects nearly 45 million people worldwide.
It is a progressive, multifactorial, and irreversible disorder characterized
by various pathological markers in the brain, particularly fibrillar
deposits of the 4 kDa amyloid β (Aβ) peptide in the neuronal
synapses.1−3 Aβ is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP)
and hence defies the long-standing protein structure–function
paradigm.4−7 The lack of a single, well-defined equilibrium structure usually
makes IDPs highly prone to self-assembly and aggregation, and in several
cases such as Aβ, the insoluble aggregates are associated with
the onset of debilitating neurodegenerative and other diseases.8−10 The amyloid hypothesis postulates that the aggregation of Aβ
into insoluble, fibrillar aggregates marks the onset of AD.11 However, in recent years, accumulating evidence
substantiates the hypothesis that small, soluble Aβ oligomers,
rather than mature fibrils formed subsequently, may be the critical
players in the pathology of AD.12−16 Hence, uncovering the mechanisms of early self-assembly and oligomeric
interactions, as well as factors that can potentially accelerate or
slow down the rate of self-assembly of Aβ are among the key
prerequisites for developing effective therapies against AD onset
and progression.

Over the last few decades, increasing clinical
evidence has shown
a correlation of AD onset and cognitive decline with the occurrence
of hyperglycemia and type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in elderly individuals.17−21 It has been observed that elevated blood glucose levels caused by
several factors including insulin dysfunction and resistance may increase
the chances of AD pathogenesis.21,22 However, conclusive
evidence demonstrating mechanistic linkages between excess glucose
in the bloodstream and the onset of AD is still lacking. The search
for the underlying causative factors is further complicated due to
seemingly contradictory evidence. For example, it has been suggested
that glucose may have some beneficial effects on the cognitive abilities
of healthy individuals, whereas hyperglycemia may trigger neuronal
death by excessive amyloid deposition in those already predisposed
toward AD.23 An emerging consensus appears
to associate the post-translational chemical modifications of Aβ
in hyperglycemic environments to its rate of self-assembly.23,24 Particularly, Aβ modified as an advanced glycation end product
(AGE) is thought to possess aggravated toxicity compared to that of
the unmodified Aβ.25,26 Using extensive atomistic
computer simulations, we have recently demonstrated that Aβ
with AGE modified lysines possesses greater β-sheet propensity
and is thermodynamically predisposed to stronger self-association.27

It is noteworthy here that although AGE
modifications of Aβ
are found to enhance the peptide’s self-assembly, there exist
no studies to date on how hyperglycemic conditions may directly influence
the protein’s self-assembly thermodynamics and thereby modulate
the process in an alternative manner independent of plausible chemical
modifications. This aspect becomes particularly important when one
notes that macromolecular crowding of the aqueous environment can
play a major role in altering the physical characteristics of a protein
and its rate of self-association.28−34 Particularly, simple sugars such as glucose, trehalose, sucrose,
and polysaccharides such as dextran and Ficoll, frequently used as
molecular crowding agents and as components for mimicking cytoplasmic
crowding environments, can have profound effects on protein self-assembly.35−39 Various experimental and theoretical studies have demonstrated modest
to drastic effects of macromolecular crowding on protein self-assembly
and aggregation.29,40−47 It is further interesting to note recent works demonstrating that
mixtures of solvents may influence protein conformation and solubilities
in a manner distinct from those brought about by pure solvents.48,49

In light of the crucial influence of glucose in the aggregation
propensities of Aβ, and thereby in the onset of AD, it is imperative
to decouple its potential physical effects vis-à-vis crowding
and its possible roles via chemical modifications in the modulation
of Aβ self-assembly. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have
been widely used to provide molecular insights into the structure,
dynamics, and self-assembly of amyloidogenic proteins such as Aβ,
islet amyloid polypeptide, α-synuclein, and prion.50−69 Herein, we present a systematic study based on fully atomistic computer
simulations of the role of glucose molecules in modulating the dimerization
of independent, full-length Aβ units. This earliest step in
Aβ self-assembly is a crucial component in the nucleation–polymerization
growth of Aβ oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils.50,70 Our studies reveal that high glucose concentrations have a small
effect on the overall properties of the Aβ monomer including
conformational fluctuations, structure compactness, intrapeptide contacts,
and secondary structure propensities. Upon analyzing the early dimerization
of Aβ peptides in glucose solution, we observed that there is
a small but appreciable weakening in the binding strength of the dimers,
concurrent with an observable loss in contacts between the hydrophobic
domains of the peptide units. A component-wise analysis of the binding
free energy reveals that the loss arises primarily from the weakening
of the van der Waals (vdW) interaction energies accompanying the loss
in residue contacts. Considering the potential crowding effects brought
about by glucose molecules, we further investigated the solvent distributions
in the vicinity of the Aβ dimeric complexes and found important
effects that arise due to the presence of glucose. Our calculated
preferential interaction parameters indicate that glucose molecules
form a “cage” within about 5–7 Å of the
protein heavy atoms that trap water molecules in the vicinity of the
protein and create a distinctive increase in side chain hydration.
This excess hydration reduces the efficacy of the hydrophobic effect
and weakens the interactions between the hydrophobic domains of the
Aβ units, accounting for an approximately 50% reduction in the
strength of the binding free energy. Our results offer strong credence
to the hypothesis that “standalone” physical effects
of hyperglycemic conditions are incapable of consolidating Aβ
self-assembly and enhancing its aggregation. Therefore, the observed
clinical effects of hyperglycemic conditions on AD should be primarily
via chemical modifications of Aβ, and plausibly through AGE
modifications.

Results and Discussion
Effects on Monomeric Conformation
We begin first by
investigating the effect of glucose molecules on the conformational
dynamics of the Aβ monomeric conformation. Representative snapshots
from the PW-M and PG-M ensembles are illustrated in Figure 1a,b. In Figure 1c, we present the root-mean-square deviation
(RMSD) of the monomer relative to the initial structure in the PW-M
and PG-M systems, averaged over multiple simulation trajectories.
We find that amongst the two systems, the average RMSD of the monomer
is only slightly lower in glucose solution than that in pure water
(PW), indicating a very marginal difference in fluctuations of the
monomer in the presence of glucose. The mean RMSD values for the PG-M
and PW-M systems, averaged over the last 150 ns, are 12.2 (±0.8)
and 13.7 (±0.6) Å, respectively.

color scale for the contact probability is shown at the extreme right
of each plot. The color bar at the top and right of each plot represents
the segments in the Aβ peptide.

Several studies have reported that in water, Aβ peptide
adopts
collapsed conformations that are attributable largely to the strong
hydrophobic interactions of the CHC, and the hydrophobic regions at
the C-terminus of the peptide.71−78 We analyzed the radius of gyration of the monomer of the two systems
as a measure of the peptide’s overall compactness. The mean Rg value of the Aβ monomer is 12.9 (±0.8)
in the PG-M system and 11.5 (±0.5) Å in the PW-M system
over the last 150 ns of the trajectories, indicating a small decrease
of the mean Rg by 1.4 Å in the latter
system. In Figure 1d, we compare the distribution of Rg values,
and an overall shift to slightly higher values accompanied by a slight
narrowing of the distribution is evident in the PG-M system. We note
here that the probability distribution of Rg of the PW-M system peaks at 10.4 Å, which is in close agreement
with a previous report.53 The peak positions
in the Rg distribution in PG-M can be
observed at 11.4 and 13.8 Å, further underscoring the changes
in compactness in the presence of glucose within the solvent environment.

As reported extensively in previous studies,27,52 the collapse of the Aβ peptide in an aqueous environment arises
due to dewetting transitions and the resulting favorable interactions
between distal hydrophobic residues located within the peptide sequence.
To understand the key inter-residue interactions that are altered
in the presence of glucose, we compared the intramonomer contact maps,
which are presented in Figure 1e,f, respectively. For our analyses, we considered five segments
of the Aβ peptide: NTR (D1AEFRHDSGYEVHHQK16), CHC (L17VFFA21), TR (V24GSN27), SHR (G29AIIGLM35), and CTR (V36GGVVIA42). The NTR and TR segments are mostly
hydrophilic, whereas the CHC, SHR, and CTR segments are mainly hydrophobic.
The contacts obtained in PW-M are similar to those reported in previous
studies. The strongest inter-residue contacts are observed in the
CHC/SHR, TR/CTR, and SHR/CTR regions. Importantly, a large number
of the strongest contacts observed in PW-M are lost in the PG-M system;
upon inspection, it was revealed that the contacts lost in PG-M are
predominantly hydrophobic contacts. The number of high probability,
non-nearest neighbor contacts, defined as contacts between residues
spaced by three or more units in the sequence, is 41 in the PW-M system
and 28 in the PG-M system. Interestingly, we find that in addition
to the loss in key hydrophobic contacts, a few strong contacts involving
nonhydrophobic residues emerge in the PG-M system, suggesting a subtle
alteration in the role of the solvent environment in contact formation
upon the addition of glucose. This aspect is further corroborated
when we compare the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of the
high probability contact residues in both systems. The SASA per contact
residue side chain is 69.2 Å2 in PW-M and 81.0 Å2 in PG-M, indicating that the contacts formed are relatively
more exposed to the solvent in the latter system.

We finally
examined the residue-wise secondary structural propensities
of the monomers in the two systems; the comparisons are depicted in Figure 2a–c. In PW-M,
the β-strands are mainly located in the NTR, CHC, SHR, and CTR
regions; it is noteworthy that these regions participate maximally
in the intramonomer contacts and in the overall compactification of
the peptide monomer in water. We point out that similar conformational
contacts in these regions have been reported previously in experimental
and computational studies.51,75,78−81 The comparison between the PW-M and PG-M systems indicates that
the presence of glucose is correlated with an overall decrease in
β-strand propensities within the monomer.

helix, (b) β-sheet, and (c) coil for the PW-M (in turquoise)
and PG-M (in orange) ensembles.

These preliminary analyses indicate that the presence of
glucose
in the aqueous environment triggers small changes in the peptide’s
conformational fluctuations, compactness, intrapeptide hydrophobic
contacts, solvent accessibility, and in the overall secondary structural
propensities. In the following sections, we investigate in detail
the ramifications of these changes on the peptide’s self-association
into the dimeric structure, and the associated differential role of
solvation attributed to the presence of glucose.

Intermonomer
Association and Structural Propensities
It is well-known
that the Aβ peptide can self-associate to
form several different assembly forms ranging from dimers to higher
oligomers and aggregates of amyloid fibrils.13,16,78,82,83 The Aβ dimer is of particular interest as it
is the smallest neurotoxic species that impairs synaptic plasticity
and memory, and further it is a key component in the nucleation mechanism.82,84−87 Experimental and computational studies showed that Aβ1–42 forms stable dimers in solution.88−90 Herein, we
have characterized the physical effect of glucose crowding on the
spontaneous Aβ dimeric assembly process from the initial monomeric
state. The dimerization event was first monitored via the center of
mass distance between the two monomers in PW and in the glucose solution. Figure 3a shows the time
evolution of the center of mass distance between the two monomeric
units. The distributions of the distances obtained from the first
25 ns, as well as from the last 150 ns of the independent trajectories
of the PW-D and PG-D systems are compared in Figure 3b,c. We observe that within the first 25
ns, the intermonomer distance in the PW-D system decreases dramatically
from 33 to 10 Å. A similar phenomenon is observed in the PG-D
system in which the intermonomer peptide distance, on average, decreases
to 11 Å within the initial 25 ns. The mean intermonomer center
of mass distances in the PW-D and PG-D systems are similar within
the first 25 ns of simulations, being 21.5 (±7.1) and 25.3 (±5.5)
Å, respectively. In the PW-D system, after the initial 25 ns,
the intermonomer distance fluctuates around 10–11 Å for
the remaining part of the trajectory. However, in the PG-D system,
beyond 25 ns, the distance increases to about 20 Å in the next
10 ns and then fluctuates between 18 and 20 Å subsequently. Within
the last 15 ns, the interpeptide center of mass distance in this system
again decreases to 16 Å. This is reflected in the bimodal distance
distribution in the PG-D system, with a smaller population peaking
at 16 Å and a relatively larger population peaking at around
18–20 Å. The mean intermonomer center of mass distances
in the PW-D and PG-D systems over the last 150 ns are 10.5 (±1.2)
and 17.8 (±1.9) Å, respectively. It is worth noting here
that although both systems exhibit a drop in the interpeptide distance
within the first 25 ns and a relative stability in this value over
the last 150 ns, at any point of time, the mean distance is always
greater in the PG-D system, suggestive of a discernable effect of
glucose crowding on the spontaneous dimerization ability of Aβ
in water.

interpeptide interaction strength over the simulation timescale. Data
for the PW-D and PG-D trajectories are shown in light blue and gold,
respectively, and the averages corresponding to them are shown in
teal and orange, respectively. (b and e) Probability distributions
for the first 25 ns and (c and f) last 150 ns, corresponding to the
data in (a) and (d). PW-D and PG-D are shown in turquoise and orange,
respectively.

We further evaluated
the intermonomer interaction energies as a
function of simulation time in the PW-D and PG-D systems; this quantity
has previously been used as an (preliminary) indicator of the interpeptide
interactions (binding strengths).27,81,88,91,92Figure 3d depicts
the time evolution of the interactions as observed in the trajectories
of the PW-D and PG-D systems. Spontaneous dimerization of the Aβ
peptide in both systems is marked by a lowering of the interaction
energies within the first 50 ns, followed by a stability in the interaction
energies over the latter part of the trajectories. Figure 3e,f depicts the probability
distributions of the interpeptide interactions over the first 25 ns
and the last 150 ns. The distribution over the first 25 ns peaks at
0.0 kcal mol–1 in both the PW-D and PG-D systems,
indicating a lack of any significant initiation of dimerizing interactions
in the earliest part of the trajectories. We mention here that the
lack of significant interactions in the earliest parts of the simulations,
noted previously in other reports, corresponds to the diffusive part
of the Aβ dimerization process.88,93 Unlike the
early distributions, the distributions over the latter parts of the
trajectory peak at −268.0 and −160.0 kcal mol–1, respectively, in the PW-D and PG-D systems, indicating the presence
of strong interpeptide dimerizing interactions. It is noteworthy that
although the peaks corresponding to the two systems are well separated,
there is a distinct degree of overlap between the two distributions.
However, the distribution for the PG-D system is markedly narrower
than that of the PW-D system, indicating a lower extent of fluctuations
in the interactions in the presence of glucose in the solvent environment.
The mean and standard deviation values of the interaction energies
over the final 25 ns of the PG-D and PW-D simulation trajectories
are −175.0 (±23.7) and −192.2 (±29.8) kcal
mol–1, respectively.

We next proceeded to
analyze the structural features of the dimers
formed in the two systems by comparing the intermonomer residue–residue
contact probability map, illustrated in Figure 4a,b, respectively. We computed the contact
probability for the last 150 ns of each trajectory, leading to a cumulative
simulation time of 450 ns for each system. As in other recent studies,
a pair of residues forms a contact if the center of mass distance
between their side chains does not exceed 7 Å.27,75,81,92 As apparent
from the comparison of contact maps, there is a significant reduction
in the total number of intermonomer contacts in PG-D as compared to
that of the PW-D system. We note that in the PW-D ensemble, the region
of high contact density involves hydrophobic interactions between
the CHC and CTR segments, which is in agreement with the previously
reported studies.27,94 The SHR/CHC, SHR/TR, SHR/SHR,
and SHR/CTR regions also display high contact density. Interestingly,
there is a high density of contacts between the hydrophilic NTR and
hydrophobic CTR regions. In addition, a moderate density of contacts
is localized in the NTR/CHC and NTR/TR regions. On the other hand,
in the PG-D system, a reduction in the intermonomer contacts is evident
amongst the hydrophobic segments CHC, SHR, and CTR, whereas there
is a modest density of contacts between the hydrophilic NTR with NTR
as well as the hydrophobic CHC and SHR segments. Contacts are also
formed between the hydrophilic TR and hydrophobic CTR region. We have
further provided the intermonomer interaction energy maps corresponding
to the average vdW interaction among the residues in Figure 4c,d for the PW-D and PG-D systems,
respectively. We observe that the inter-residue contact probabilities
among the monomers are vividly reflected in the average vdW interaction
energies. Especially noticeable is the substantial weakening of vdW
interaction energies in the hydrophobic patches of the peptides in
the PG-D system, which corroborates with a loss of contacts in these
regions. We further analyzed the secondary structural propensities
of the Aβ peptides of the dimeric systems in the two solvent
environments. Comparing the overall secondary structure content in
the two systems, depicted in Figure 5a–c, we observe a subtle β-sheet propensity
of the residues in the hydrophobic CHC, TR, and CTR segments in PW-D.
It is interesting to note that β-sheet propensity in these regions
is absent in the PG-D system. The discussion above demonstrates that
the spontaneous dimerization of Aβ peptide is discernably compromised
in the presence of glucose molecules. Importantly, the dimerization
process is primarily affected by the distinct loss in key hydrophobic
contacts that are known to play important roles in Aβ assembly.

Thermodynamics of Aβ Binding
The analyses presented
thus far demonstrate that hyperglycemic conditions within the aqueous
environment of the full-length Aβ peptide alter its conformational
fluctuations, secondary structure, compactness, solvent exposure,
and propensity for self-association in a noticeable manner. For deeper
insights into the origins of the distinct weakening of Aβ dimerization
observed in the presence of glucose, we calculated and compared the
intermonomer binding free energy of the peptide units, along with
the individual contributing components. This was done with the molecular
mechanics-generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA) protocol as described
in the Methods section. We point out that
this method has been routinely used to obtain binding affinities of
biomolecules.95−97 The mean and standard deviations of the various contributions
to the total binding free energy are presented in Table 1. From these data sets, it can be observed that the mean value of
the binding free energy, ΔGbind,
is lower in the PW-D system than that in the PG-D system by a value
ranging from 25.2 to 27.2 kcal mol–1, reflecting
the relatively stronger dimerizing interactions in the former system.
It is observed in both systems that the favorable binding free energy
of dimerization originates predominantly from the nonpolar terms,
namely, ΔEvdW and ΔGsolv-np. Interestingly, the fluctuations
observed in each component of the binding free energy are consistently
higher in the PW-D system. The contribution of the electrostatic interactions
between the two monomers (ΔEelec) is offset by the contribution arising due to the polar solvation
free energy (ΔGsolv-pol).
It is important to note here that a critical component of the binding
ΔGbind is obtained from the solvation
free energy of the nonpolar moieties of the dimerizing units, ΔGsolv-np; this quantity is markedly lower
in the PW-D system. This observation suggests a relatively greater
thermodynamic favorability of sequestering hydrophobic contacts in
the PW-D system; this is corroborated by results discussed later.
The magnitude of the differences in ΔGsolv-np between the two systems varies between 6.6 and
7.5 kcal mol–1. Overall, these results suggest that
in the crowded environment of glucose solution, there is a distinct
weakening of the binding free energies that contributes to the dimerization
of the full-length Aβ units. Such behavior qualitatively agrees
with experimental and computational findings that sugars, which function
as osmolytes within cells, hamper the aggregation of amyloidogenic
peptides or globular proteins.36,98−101 We point out that previous reports of Aβ dimerization have
ignored the contributions arising due to loss in configurational entropy.93,102 We estimated the cumulative configurational entropy of the protein
backbone atoms of the Aβ peptides for the PW-D and PG-D systems,
calculated for the initial 10 ns of the dimerizing trajectories when
the proteins exist as individual units as well as for the last 10
ns when the proteins have dimerized, using Schlitter’s method,103 as described in the Supporting Information (SI). The entropy change of the Aβ peptides
upon dimerization (ΔSmonomer–dimer) is small and comparable for the PW-D and PG-D systems, the values
being 1.1 × 10–3 and 0.9 × 10–3 kcal mol–1 K–1, respectively.
Therefore, they are not considered in the calculation of ΔGbind. The results presented thus far establish
that the self-association of full-length Aβ units is thermodynamically
weakened when an excess of glucose molecules is present.

Glucose Caging Modulates Aβ Hydration and Interactions
The solvent environment has a profound influence on the self-assembly
behavior of IDPs such as Aβ.52,93,104−108 Importantly, dewetting transitions and hydrophobic associations
between Aβ monomers play a crucial role in the peptide’s
self-association.52,76,77 In Figure 6, we depict
representative snapshots of the dimeric state of the protein in the
absence and in the presence of glucose in the solvent environment.
The weakened association between the Aβ units and the resultant
loss in the compactification of the dimeric state in the presence
of glucose in the solvent is evident upon comparison.

Figure 6 Representative structures
from the dimeric ensembles (a) PW-D and
(b) PG-D; the two peptide units are colored in pink and green. The
residues involved in interpeptide high probability contacts are depicted
by a translucent gray surface, with side chains represented as sticks
and colored teal. Glucose molecules around the PG-D dimer within a
distance of 7 Å from the protein units are shown as orange colored
spheres and the water oxygens around the dimers in both the systems
are shown as spheres colored skyblue.

In light of our findings, we further investigated how the
nature
of surface hydration could be altered in the presence of glucose.
We first computed the selected site–site radial distribution
function, g(r), involving the protein
and the different solution species in PW and glucose solution, for
both the monomeric and dimeric systems. The g(r) between the protein heavy atoms and center of mass of
glucose molecules in the PG-M and PG-D systems is shown in Figure 7a,b, respectively.
We note that the protein–glucose g(r) begins to gradually increase from 3.5 Å and forms
a broad peak centered at 6 Å. This indicates that there is a
high density of glucose molecules in the shell between 5 and 7 Å
around the protein. Figure SI-1a,b displays
the g(r) calculated between the
protein heavy atoms and water oxygen atoms in the monomeric (PG-M
and PW-M) and dimeric (PG-D and PW-D) systems, respectively. Interestingly,
we observe that in the first and second peaks of the protein–water g(r), positioned at 2.8 and 3.8 Å,
respectively, there is a marginal but noticeable enhancement in the
hydration (see the figure inset) in the glucose system over that in
PW; this enhancement is consistently observed in both the monomeric
and dimeric systems. For insights into the origin of this marginal
difference, we calculated the radial distribution functions between
the water oxygens and the full side chains of the residues that participate
in internal contacts (monomeric systems), and in the interpeptide
contacts (dimeric systems) with high probability. This comparison,
presented in Figure 7c,d for the monomeric and dimeric systems, respectively, clearly
shows marked enhancements in the first and second solvation peaks
in the presence of glucose. This indicates that the differences observed
earlier can be largely attributed to the enhanced hydration of the
internal contacts formed within the monomer in the PG-M compared to
that in the PW-M system, and to the interpeptide contacts formed within
the dimer in the PG-D compared to that in the PW-D system. In Table SI-1, we have tabulated the number of high
probability, nonlocal internal contacts (in monomer) and interpeptide
(in dimer) contacts observed in the absence and in the presence of
glucose. It is noted that although some of the contacts are common,
there is an overall decrease in the number of hydrophobic contacts
in the presence of glucose. Interestingly, in the dimeric PG-D system,
most of the nonlocal contacts formed involve the participation of
polar residues (see Table SI-2), reflecting
the relatively greater difference in g(r) observed in Figure 7d. We further note here that the average SASA of the side chains
that contributes to the nonlocal interpeptide contacts increases about
3-fold in the PG-D system in comparison to that in the PW-D system
(see Table SI-3). Furthermore, we evaluated
the mean tetrahedral order parameter (Q) of the water
molecules that lie within 5 Å of the interpeptide contact residues
in the dimeric systems (see Table SI-3).
The tetrahedral order parameter is an indicator of the structural
ordering of the local hydration waters.109−111 A marginal decrease in the average Q of the waters
in the vicinity of the contacts in the PG-D relative to that in the
PW-D system reflects a small decrease in the overall local ordering
of hydration waters around the contact residues.

Figure 7 Site–site radial
distribution function, g(r), between
protein heavy atoms and glucose center
of mass of the (a) PG-M and (b) PG-D systems is represented in red.
The g(r) between the water oxygen
atoms and full side chains of residues involved in high probability
contacts of the (c) monomeric (PW-M and PG-M) and (d) dimeric (PW-D
and PG-D) systems. Data corresponding to the PW and glucose solution
(PG) are shown in turquoise and orange, respectively.

To further ascertain the preferential hydration
of Aβ peptides
in glucose solution, we characterized the relative local distribution
of water and glucose molecules around the Aβ dimers, as described
in the Methods section. Figure 8 depicts the normalized fraction of glucose
molecules (Pglc) and water oxygen (POw), as a function of the distance from the
protein heavy atoms in PW and glucose solution. Commensurate with
the g(r) trends, it can be observed
that up to a distance of 4.5 Å from the protein heavy atoms, POw is greater than 1, which signifies that the
Aβ peptides are more preferentially hydrated in the glucose
solution. In addition, Pglc is lower than
1 at a distance below 4.5 Å with a peak greater than 1 in the
distance range 5–7 Å. This indicates that the glucose
molecules are excluded from the surface of the dimer and form a dense
space-filling network surrounding the dimer at a distance of 5–7
Å, which causes a depletion of water in this region. This cage-like
network traps the water molecules at the surface of the protein resulting
in enhanced hydration of the dimer. Considering the relevance of a
dewetting-induced hydrophobic collapse to Aβ self-assembly,
we further investigated if the phenomenon of glucose caging and enhanced
protein surface hydration occurs at the dimer interface. Analyses
of the preferential interaction parameters for the dimer interface
region, depicted in Figure 8, reveal that concurrent to the whole dimer, the interfacial
region is characterized by a water-enriched hydration shell resulting
from the caging effect of glucose. We remark here that the presence
of the water molecules caged at the protein surface by the glucose
clusters reduces the overall interactions between hydrophobic residues
that provide a major driving force for Aβ self-assembly, and
account for the reduced binding strength of the resulting dimers.

and the lower panel represents POw for
PW-D and PG-D (whole dimer), in turquoise and orange, respectively,

Conclusions
Numerous epidemiological
studies over the last few decades have
linked T2DM to an increased risk of AD.17−21 Notably, evidence has suggested that hyperglycemia-mediated
glycated Aβ (Aβ-AGE) is significantly more pathogenic
than the unglycated one and augments AD progression both in vitro
and in vivo.25,26 However, with accumulating knowledge
on the implications of macromolecular crowding on protein self-assembly,
there are currently no studies probing the physical aspects of crowded
hyperglycemic conditions on the thermodynamics of Aβ self-assembly.
Further, it is important to note complex effects that may be brought
about on biomolecular conformations by the crowding interactions of
solvent mixtures.48,49 In light of such observations,
we have, in the present study, used classical MD simulations to delineate
the physical effects of the crowded environment of aqueous glucose
solution on the conformational stability and the self-assembly characteristics
of full-length Aβ peptide. We find that the glucose-crowded
environment has a narrow but discernable impact on the Aβ monomer
with respect to its conformational fluctuations, compactness, internal
contacts, solvent exposure, and in its overall secondary structure
propensities. Our simulations of the early self-assembly of Aβ
monomers reveal that the resultant dimers in glucose solution exhibit
weakened peptide–peptide binding free energies and a substantial
loss in the number of intermonomer contacts. It is noteworthy that
the reduced binding strength of the dimers mainly arises from overall
weakening of the dispersion interactions that is commensurate with
the loss of inter-residue contacts in the hydrophobic segments of
the peptides. Considering the critical role that hydration water plays
in protein aggregation as well as the excluded volume effect owing
to the presence of glucose molecules, we evaluated the local hydration
pattern of the dimers to elucidate if crowding modulates Aβ
hydration. Our analysis of the preferential interactions of Aβ
with the solvent species indicates that glucose molecules cluster
around the peptides at a distance of 5–7 Å and enrich
the shell in the vicinity of the protein surface with water molecules.
This preferential hydration of the Aβ peptides and the caging
effect of glucose molecules screen the hydrophobic interactions between
the peptides and weaken the binding strength of the resulting dimers.
Our results demonstrate the physical effects of hyperglycemic conditions
and the resultant crowding effects on the conformational properties
and early self-assembly of Aβ.

Further studies in our
laboratory are underway to dissect the effects
of crowding on the microscopic details of the structural and dynamical
properties of the hydration layer of the Aβ dimers in glucose
solution. In view of the enhanced Aβ neurotoxicity upon hyperglycemia
induced chemical modifications, it is further important to gain a
molecular level understanding of the self-assembly of these chemically
modified Aβ peptides under hyperglycemic conditions. These studies
will aid in gaining molecular insights into the copathogenesis of
T2DM and AD as well as provide incentives to design effective therapeutic
strategies to counteract the harmful effects of these debilitating
diseases.

Methods
System Setup and MD Simulations
All MD simulations
reported in this study were performed using the NAMD simulation package.112 The details of the Aβ conformations generated
and used are described below. The simulations were performed under
periodic boundary conditions using the NAMD2.9 simulation package.112 The CHARMM22 force field with CMAP correction113 was used to simulate the peptides, the CHARMM36
all-atom carbohydrate force field113 was
used for glucose parameters, and the TIP3P114 water model was used for the solvent. We point out that the CHARMM
force field has been noted to sample Aβ conformations with high
levels of accuracy.115 A time step of 2
fs was used. A constant temperature of 310 K was maintained with Langevin
dynamics at a collision frequency of 1 ps–1, and
a pressure of 1 atm was maintained with the Nosé–Hoover
method.116 Long-range electrostatic interactions
were computed using the particle-mesh Ewald method117 and covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained
using the SHAKE algorithm.118 The systems
were first energy minimized for 15 000 steps using the conjugate
gradient method followed by simulations in the isothermal–isobaric
(NPT) ensemble. Three independent MD simulations were performed for
full-length Aβ units in PW and glucose–water mixture
(PG) solvents. Each trajectory was of 200 ns duration, amounting to
a cumulative simulation time of 0.6 μs for each system.

Aβ
Simulations
The details of the generation
of the Aβ monomeric conformation can be found in previous work
conducted by our group.27,81 Briefly, the solution
state NMR structure of the full-length Aβ1–42 peptide obtained in a 3:7 mixture of hexafluoro-2-propanol and water
(PDB entry: 1Z0Q)119 was heated in the gas phase at 373
K. From the ensemble of the random coil configurations, ten structures
were independently simulated at 310 K in explicit water for a minimum
of 150 ns, generating a cumulative simulation data set of over 1.6
μs. Principal Component Analysis was then performed on the ensemble
of the Aβ conformations and a conformation of the peptide representing
one of the most populated clusters was chosen as the starting monomeric
structure for our studies. The representative structure was benchmarked
with experimental data by simulating it for 6 ns and comparing the 15N and 13Cα chemical shifts, which
were calculated using the SHIFTS program.120 We point out here that the structural propensities of the chosen
initial conformation are remarkably similar to those of the full-length
Aβ conformation reported to populate the peptide’s ensemble
in water.51,53

The dimeric simulations were initiated
by placing the two Aβ monomers at a center of mass distance
of 33 Å and solvating in PW and glucose solution to obtain the
PW-D and PG-D systems, respectively. The PW-D system was solvated
explicitly in a cubic box containing 22 284 TIP3P114 water molecules. The glucose simulation box
of the PG-D system was built by placing the two monomeric structures
at a center of mass distance of 33 Å with a random distribution
of glucose molecules using the Packmol121 program, followed by solvation with TIP3P114 water molecules. The glucose concentration chosen was 108 g L–1, which amounted to 218 glucose molecules in a cubic
box containing 14 968 water molecules. The minimum distance
from the extremities of the protein to the edge of the simulation
box was at least 15 Å. Similarly, for the monomeric systems,
the Aβ peptide conformer described above was solvated in a cubic
box of water and glucose solution at a concentration of 108 g L–1 to obtain the PW-M and PG-M systems, respectively.
For each protein–solvent system, three independent trajectories
of 200 ns each were generated. The system and simulation details are
summarized in Table 2. All of the trajectories were equilibrated for 50 ns, and the nontemporal
analyses were done for the equilibrated part (last 150 ns) of the
trajectories.

Trajectory Analysis
Secondary Structure
Secondary structural propensities
for individual residues were obtained using the STRIDE algorithm,122 as implemented in VMD.123

Protein–Protein Interaction Energy
The nonbonded
interaction energies (electrostatic and vdW) between the peptide units
were calculated using the NAMD Energy plugin available in the NAMD
package.112 The interaction energy, E, composed of electrostatic and vdW interactions, for a
pair of atoms of charges qi and qj, separated
by a distance rij, is
given by 1  where the parameters σij, εij, and D are obtained from
the force field.

SASA
SASA values were calculated
using the VMD package123 by rolling a spherical
probe of radius 1.4
Å over the protein residue surface.

Binding Free Energy
The absolute binding free energies
between the two Aβ monomers were obtained using the MM-GBSA
method, as implemented in the NAMD package.95,96 The calculation was performed using the single trajectory method
on the dimer as well as each of the monomeric subunits constituting
the complex. The total free energy of each of the components is defined
as 2  where HMM, Gsolv-pol, Gsolv-np, and Sconfig represent the total internal
energy, the polar solvation free energy, the nonpolar solvation free
energy, and the configurational entropy, respectively. The internal
energy, HMM, is composed of the bond,
angle, dihedral, improper, electrostatic, and vdW energies. The solvent
dielectric constant of water at 310 K was used to compute the polar
solvation free energy.124 The nonpolar
solvation free energy, Gsolv-np, is quantified as the product of the surface tension of water (γ
= 0.0072) and the SASA of the solute. The binding free energy is estimated
as the difference 3  The entropic changes are ignored as in previous
recent studies.56,95,96,125 The binding free energy of the dimer complex
is thus obtained as 4  where ΔEelectrostatic, ΔEvdW, and ΔEinternal are the changes in the electrostatic, vdW, and
bonded energies, respectively.

Preferential Interaction
Parameters
To obtain information
about the enrichment or exclusion of solution species at the protein
surface, we estimated the solute–solvent preferential interaction
parameters. These parameters have provided profound insights on protein
solvation in several earlier works.36,126−129 Accordingly, the time-averaged normalized preferential interaction
parameters of solution species, water (POw), and glucose (Pglc) can be defined
as 5   6  where nOw and nglc refer to the local number of
water oxygen
atoms and glucose molecules, respectively, located at a distance  “r” from the heavy atoms of the protein; NOw and Nglc correspond to
the total number of water oxygen atoms and glucose molecules in the
simulation box, respectively. If the ratio Px(r) is greater than 1 in
close proximity of the peptide, then the respective solvent species
preferentially interacts with the peptide. Conversely, if the ratio
is lower than 1, the solvent molecules are preferentially excluded
from the surface of the peptide.
